i heard gp is hard good thing im not taking as HAHAHA,btohqsg
and compare w ur 15 ones,btohqsg

i mean the fact that u can get up to 45 means ur there alr,btohqsg
"this one cos of some ""nuance"" or wtv in the qn right",btohqsg
"according to my cher there r ""straightforward"" qns which r just listing pros and cons and ""complicated"" qns which need link to some specific aspect",btohqsg
hellos if any of y'all need emath TB  pure sciences TB  elect geog TB & chinese guidebooks dm me ok 😭😭 letting them go at a discounted price   tryna clear space on my room👍👍👍,btohqsg
Rip sia I think gonna be,btohqsg
idk what im doing  selling textbooks before O levels HAHAH,btohqsg
my jnrs all using same tho,btohqsg
who cares about how plates move,btohqsg
It's so ez to explain aft,btohqsg
I was so scared of pure geog,btohqsg
I was scared of pure geog cuz of y'all....,btohqsg
yeah I take pure geog ehist,btohqsg
how does ur brain memorize bio+hist+geog,btohqsg
I had both bio hist and geog p1 across 3 dats,btohqsg
I look like I wanna cry aft the exam bro,btohqsg
wah i elect geog alr complain hand pain,btohqsg
these fuckers put emath p2 and both bio Ps 1 day,btohqsg
i hope your heart  your hand  your body is ok,btohqsg
They just prep us for JC ATP....,btohqsg
Is it the way the teacher conduct the lesson?,btohqsg
had like gp and econs on the same day,btohqsg
both of them tgt is the worst,btohqsg
I had tourism gi for prelims sia,btohqsg
infiltrating knowledge into long term memory,btohqsg
I throw back my Geog knowledge into the book.,btohqsg
but all in all plate tech is the best la,btohqsg
same i die die also do w&c,btohqsg
meanwhile in pure geog u cannot choose ur gi topic,btohqsg
its either coast  tourism or combined,btohqsg
yea which means u need to know how to do both,btohqsg
tbh if ur GI not so good but ur content knowledge is solid,btohqsg
u can breeze thru ur paper de,btohqsg
albeit ur p2 u might have to sacrifice ur hand welfare,btohqsg
in p1 the extra 10min is to analyse the data for GI,btohqsg
Ppl ard me r like wtf,btohqsg
The only thing I rmb about Pure Geog is to write like mad.,btohqsg
i didn't study for my geo prelims and i legit smoked thr the whole ppr,btohqsg
so if ur faster at analysing the data u have an edge over the others ?,btohqsg
i basically didn't touch qns w plate tect HENGGG WE CAN CHOOSE WHICH QN TO DO,btohqsg
I can analyse q fast I think,btohqsg
It's either geog or drama if I want pure bio chem doo,btohqsg
well p2 will challenge ur hand welfare ig 🤡🤡🤡,btohqsg
even during the o levels i cldnt finish p2,btohqsg
i could finish sect A completely during Os but,btohqsg
sect B was disastrous bc i was like wtf am i doing,btohqsg
The real ppl that passed away tho?,btohqsg
yea in the end i could still get A1,btohqsg
I think they purposely one.. Test on your writing speed   ability to adapt in ‘fast-pace’ environment.,btohqsg
my sch one v high sia,btohqsg
Students complain enuf for them to not actually do that sia,btohqsg
apparently ppl in my sch who takes pure geog do damn well,btohqsg
dk how they do it but,btohqsg
I took one day to do my Econ report.,btohqsg
well ig they chose pure geog bc they rly liked it,btohqsg
well at least for me it was the case,btohqsg
but then the price paid was that i was suffering in history,btohqsg
My sch subj comb forced e geog if u wan triple sci or sci chem bio,btohqsg
the only part i liked abt history was the SBQ,btohqsg
NAH BRUH IM GLAD I TAKE ELECT,btohqsg
then my RAM memory cannot rmb historical details,btohqsg
Cuz that's whr the interesting stuff at,btohqsg
shouldn't they let u choose ur elective subj,btohqsg
well my sch didnt have pure history for my batch,btohqsg
Depends on what sci u wan,btohqsg
my sch oni 5 ppl take pure lit LMAO,btohqsg
im surprised they even opened a class for that,btohqsg
Else S2 me would choose lit,btohqsg
Deh my sch got 1 13 people form class,btohqsg
tbh why would u choose a subject u wouldn’t like anyways,btohqsg
honestly my pure geog class was full 40,btohqsg
then pure lit was like 10-20 somewhere there,btohqsg
mine is all diff class sia,btohqsg
tbh dont regret double humanities tho,btohqsg
i chose double humanities cos idk if my combined humans could save me for Os,btohqsg
1 humanities subj must be included for L1R5 anyways,btohqsg
Oh my sch force double humans unless u triple sci,btohqsg
Cuz I trust my geog more than my elect,btohqsg
and also i just looked thru the L1R5 requirements and humanities is compulsory in it,btohqsg
Yeah I see alrd I need bet on both my maths and scis,btohqsg
so like when i chose my subjects i just chose double humanities,btohqsg
is the most disgusting part of geog,btohqsg
I have a love for the subj,btohqsg
yea the characteristics of each volcano + explanation,btohqsg
and also u need to know how shield / strato forms anyways,btohqsg
I pray this yr legit blue book come out,btohqsg
wah i legit ditch blue book sia,btohqsg
I lazy to memo essay by essay,btohqsg
either ways before Os i was close to studying a chapter that i didnt like,btohqsg
then one cher was like saying like u must study,btohqsg
GOD BLESS THE FUCKING LORDS IT ACTUALLY CAME OUT,btohqsg
i just decided to study out of thought that she made sense,btohqsg
it depends on what is the qn type,btohqsg
and then wah actl came out,btohqsg
LUCKY I WATCH VIDS SBT THAT,btohqsg

Lit > His > GeogEdit: Secondary level  not JC,btohqsg

Paya lebar square outside free study spot,btohqsg
Hi is anyone here able to explain to me what dae to poly is about ?,btohqsg
Using your O Level grades to enter the courses ur eligible for if EAE isn’t successful.,btohqsg
oh ok so try early  if cannot then try direct?,btohqsg
EAE is to secure the course you want with a lower grade requirement so yes do try for it.,btohqsg
Is the cutoff points for dae lower?,btohqsg
For social studies why is it important to keep up with current affairs,btohqsg
cause I thought it’s more about skills?,btohqsg
Sometimes the author of a specified excerpt may be a public figure like ur ministers & opposing party members  so it helps to contextualise the excerpts better,btohqsg
id rather not get smacked by fuzzy LMAO,btohqsg
Good smack… worth smacking from a pro lol,btohqsg
true true maybe if he smack me i can get A for chem lol,btohqsg
Is there ecf in a levels,btohqsg
Is a mystery that Cambridge dun disclose when there is and where there isn't,btohqsg
For schools usually math there is no ecf,btohqsg
O level but so far I only ever see ECF used in chem calc,btohqsg
Idk abt Phys tho I don't take,btohqsg
i got feeling they dun even read working (especially if ans is correct),btohqsg
ecf is given when it's not within the same part of a question but made use of answers in an earlier part  ie part ii,btohqsg
actually after marking many papers  immediately know where to spot in the workings to find out where there's a careless or a bluff,btohqsg
After marking the same question many times I mean,btohqsg
Not true. Cambridge has months to mark. In their exam reports they do point out mistakes that sch teachers may not have paid much attention on,btohqsg
"they do random sampling for that right? like a couple of scripts they pull out to ""mark properly"" and set the standards",btohqsg
my point was that if ur marker didnt bother with looking through working  pretty much nobody would know,btohqsg
do u feel so? how much is an examiner paid for 1 script? based on that  how much time do u think they take?,btohqsg
Like what Jun Wei mentioned. It is easy to memorise the whole list of standard errors. It is e@sy to spot the mistakes thereafter.,btohqsg
One subject per pax MOE paid can be hundreds,btohqsg
yes  and that's for how many scripts?,btohqsg
yea so if u mess up 1 working u ggwp,btohqsg
Anyway the point is nobody really knows how the scripts are marked. ECF or not... So better not give the wrong info that makes other members here think marking is less lax than what it seems,btohqsg
really ah? so if u grade 20 scripts u get ~10 000?,btohqsg
Minus off all the other administration fees. Etc.Even $10 or $20 per script (and need not even be full script if is marked by question) is pretty good money.Anyways is not about money or what. But is a pretty bold statement to say they do random making or anyhow mark.Things that my contacts in SEAB also do not know i am surprised you seem to know more.,btohqsg
sg budget for SEAB per year ~200mln,btohqsg
lets say O levels take 6 subj  A levels take 4 subj (conservative),btohqsg
so that is 400 000 papers to mark every year,btohqsg
if what u say is correct  then SEAB use their whole budget just to pay for marking?,btohqsg
So the message I want to mention is dear students dun rely on ECF etc or lax marking and be less careful of your work or put less effort,btohqsg
last time we used to need to pay near $100 per subject to take O and A levels,btohqsg
idk i rmbr there was some news article abt it,btohqsg
Hey guys I have a qn to ask! Should I be taking a break after prelims or should I continue revising for o levels ? I feel kind of burnt out tbh. Thanks !,btohqsg
break for a day or 2,btohqsg
If u feel burnt out remedy it asap,btohqsg
Else it'll snowball and become more of a shitstorm,btohqsg
I feel I cannot let go of studying the content,btohqsg
Rest for awhile  but not too long if not ltr become lazi  ☠☠,btohqsg
Has anyone triedbrilliant.org? Specifically to cover H2 maths? Does anyone think brilliant is rigerous enough,btohqsg
How long is not too long Hahaha,btohqsg
For me like 3-4 days ?,btohqsg
i havent but in my experience w khan acad at least they tend to teach more US centric syllabus so it might miss out some stuff and add in extra stuff which might no be necessary,btohqsg
Hm. Interesting. I'll give Khan a shot,btohqsg
yea i wld say theyre not bad at explaining concepts (just a matter of whether its relevant for our syllabus or not),btohqsg
I'm asking 'cuz I wanna take Maths mods in uni without JC experience  and I don't wanna did :p,btohqsg
Local unis have math bridging modules,btohqsg
You'll likely need to take those before being allowed to take most math mods in uni,btohqsg
NTU isn't telling me what they are. They literally just told me take it without H2 and see whether I can handle it,btohqsg
Is that how NTU handles it,btohqsg
What math mods are you looking at anyway,btohqsg
Literally all the 1k mods. Foundation of maths  then maybe cal 1-3. Honestly I'm not sure. There's nopure logic course  Inthink.,btohqsg
Finally done with Project work written report T_T,btohqsg
Ready to submit tomorrow morning  kiddo?,btohqsg
My school (millennia institute) wants it all submitted by tomorrow,btohqsg
yo sch ends on 13 oct for 4na right,btohqsg
hmm given thats the case i think khan might be a good option since if learn extra itll prolly be covered in ur uni anyway,btohqsg
Homie...bless ur soul. Glad to know it was a good run for u,btohqsg
I’m in a mun rn lol,btohqsg
I'm observing the rain  thinking about my fate in about 10 hours,btohqsg

tbf it is cjc thank god so if i start mugging i prolly can do p well,btohqsg
when u come jc and see the cjc papers ull laugh sia,btohqsg
usually the bane of 99% of students (including me) lol,btohqsg

Are study groups a thing here ?,btohqsg
Hii um did anyone get a call from moe? (for o-lvl students),btohqsg
sounds like a scam  but nope,btohqsg
Idk man  I'm not you  and idk what they said,btohqsg
They said this tho before calling,btohqsg
Eh  then... idk you can call the actual hotline to ask lol,btohqsg
Today I see a lot of people mask off in public in the city areas.,btohqsg

"""plz ask ur parentz to login to this address: ..."" 😇",btohqsg
Literally just take my edusave account,btohqsg
hii  can someone tell me how we should manage our time for chem paper 2,btohqsg
like how much time we should spend on section A ideally,btohqsg
For pure? I think my Cher recco abt 1hr for sect a 40 mins for sect b,btohqsg
i will try to stick to that tdy,btohqsg
But generally if I spend >2 mins on a qn,btohqsg
Like staring and not thinking of anyth,btohqsg
i would say try to spend more time into the first question of sect B because it’s usually always an unseen data-based question which has links to whatever we’ve learnt  for me it requires more time to process the info provided (almost always a page long),btohqsg
Some of the ans can copy from the info given 1,btohqsg
Try not to skip so much,btohqsg
But prioritize the questions you're able to do first,btohqsg
does anyone know whats the stats for a lvl h2 geog',btohqsg
ayyo quick qn aany of yall particpated in the SIMC thing b4?,btohqsg
