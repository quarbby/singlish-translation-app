U can bulk buy from those ‚Äúinfluenzers‚Äù,btohqsg
just google thrift shops or sth,btohqsg
‚ÄúI believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can¬†learn to let go  things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they‚Äôre right  you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself  and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.‚Äù,btohqsg
2 months cow go home liao  nvm I will think of some ways,btohqsg
Yeah just go karang guni in ur block,btohqsg

End of the world Walla Walla Walla Walla Walla,btohqsg
Does amyome have the ukcat 1250 edition book in pdf form,btohqsg
i am very lazy and procrastinating and i have a levels this year,btohqsg
It doesn‚Äôt matter. A level is just an exam.,btohqsg
If you do badly you have no one else to blame but yourself,btohqsg
Everyone is chionging their asses off,btohqsg
Except for self proclaimed 'everyday play Maple also can do well in JC' people,btohqsg
Ur A Level results can influence wat path ur life takes,btohqsg
Ok let me put it another way,btohqsg
Ur A Levels results can open more doors for u depending on how well y do,btohqsg
R u in jc or sec sch,btohqsg
As a person who graduated JC  I agree. Especially for Aptitude based admission  you need to get probably 60  if not higher enough (because of competition) to attain a place PLUS your own cca cert.,btohqsg
Tbhhhhh not really  A levels set you on a singular path anyways. You are going to uni regardless. Just depends WHICH uni,btohqsg
Id say your path was already set in stone after o levels and the JC/Poly split. Thats makes a greater difference,btohqsg
Plenty of time in NS to do that,btohqsg
how much do you study per day,btohqsg
