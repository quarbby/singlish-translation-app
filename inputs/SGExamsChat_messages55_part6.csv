Sheâ€™s not in a position that requires her to respond.,btohqsg
But would you support her to direct the err... to PRC if it was PRC that wants to give us mask?,btohqsg
I find it sad that the only reason why we got out of this geopol crisis  triggered by her  relatively unscathed in tangible terms is because Taiwan has abysmal geopol standing.If it was the PRC on the other hand  HOHOHO  wrath of the CCP on your way.,btohqsg
no? government said dont need wear  save the mask for the frontliners,btohqsg
urged us not to hoard masks,btohqsg
Even if it is not PRC  and some democratic western nation  theyâ€™ll be more reluctant to work with us on things like FTA in the future.,btohqsg
that was 4 disposable face masks,btohqsg
there is a global shortage btw,btohqsg
true  but singaporeans were DISCOURAGED from wearing them  so do you think the people who listen to the government (which are the majority btw) would bother to go down and get?,btohqsg
To reduce mask buying  why need to reduce? Shortage.,btohqsg
so why do they stop overbuying in the first place?,btohqsg
because they are aware that there might be a lack,btohqsg
besides we dont know how long this virus will last  and our national reserves are finite. A donation from Taiwan will be welcome anytime. A donation from any country in fact,btohqsg
but you were saying that the govt asked the people to stop buying in order to avoid overbuying (with the assumption that singaporeans will overbuy). So no  they wont stop buying. And yes  this takes a toll on national reserves,btohqsg
exactly  they will keep buying. So therefore we need more right  especially for critical medical operations,btohqsg
Even if we donâ€™t need  even if we argue that Taiwanâ€™s actions are 100% diplomatic posturing  that doesnâ€™t warrant her expressing err... like that!,btohqsg
A geopol crisis is no joke,btohqsg
imagine if the shelves are swept by all the panic buyers. What will our frontline staff get?,btohqsg
at this point of time  more masks are better than less masks,btohqsg
A geopol crisis amidst a global pandemic no less,btohqsg
and we should appreciate anyone who volunteers to give them to us,btohqsg
so what? You already said that singaporeans have a hoarder mentality. Circuit breaker aint gonna keep them home and stop them from buying masks,btohqsg
We do appreciate what we have at present  but that doesnt mean we should middle finger anyone that offers help,btohqsg
"unlike your ""project""  this virus is far from over.",btohqsg
your analogy only works if the virus is eradicated and THEN they offered to give us masks,btohqsg
then we can all say they wayang,btohqsg
Ho Chingâ€™s portfolio is uniqueWhat she says will be scrutinisedWhat she doesnâ€™t say will notPoliticians are scrutinised for what they say AND DONT say because theyâ€™re our legal representatives.Whereas Ho Chingâ€™s words will be scrutinised because PM Family  what she doesnâ€™t say wonâ€™t be scrutinised because she was not expected to say anything.What Iâ€™m trying to argue here is  she shouldnâ€™t have said anything  but not because of the deafening silence you proposed  but because of her 1/2 way representation of SG.,btohqsg
what are these solutions when the masks we bought runs out?1. buy more from japan (taxpayer's money+we dont know if they will have extra to sell us)2. Self production (still a long way away)donations are the most immediate and cost effective solution which will help us meet the demand for masks,btohqsg
At this time  the best course of action is to be appreciative tbh  we never know when we need their help in this coronavirus situation. After all  they are one of the more effective nations in controlling the covid,btohqsg
because singapore refuses to disclose its national reserves,btohqsg
even when the opposition questioned them,btohqsg
As for the mask situation  no country will disclose rn,btohqsg
Im using their reuseable one lmao,btohqsg
which btw is proven to be more suited to pollen and less suited to viruses,btohqsg
I mean I presume that you guys were also amongst those who hoarded food supplies,btohqsg
I do agree that the singaporeans are spineless in other ways  but being grateful for another countries masks is good diplomacy,btohqsg
Something kinda irrelevant  but have you guys seen the articles that talked about the ineffectiveness of the re-usable cloth masks that were recently distributed by the government?,btohqsg
like instead ofno mask recommended -->not discouraged (ho ching's fb post) -->encouraged (LHL's statement) -->mandatory (Lawrence Wong CB measures)They could have went straight to enforcing mandatory masks without taking a 4 week roundabout thing to avoid damaging the ruling party's repute,btohqsg
I mean I work in an essential position in the saf so my work never ends (ORD soon thank god),btohqsg
Well thought it may not be as good as the surgical mask  it could still help to keep your body fluid to yourself,btohqsg
I suppose with many people not having enough mask to use on a daily basis  we can be choosers then ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
that was the week that virus infections shot up to 447 cases,btohqsg
if they had implemented the measures 3 weeks before instead of taking a 3 week u turn  this wouldnt have happened,btohqsg
if they had enforced earlier  you cannot deny that more people would have worn it,btohqsg
what about the older generation who take recommendations from the PAP seriously?,btohqsg
"those are the people who will listen to the ""not sick no need mask"" policy which stretched way into feb-march",btohqsg
when the virus was pretty damn serious,btohqsg
"you cant cover up every failing of the PAP by saying the people would ""do something anyway"" or ""disobey governmental instructions"". Then whats the govt for? I get you to be PM easier haha",btohqsg
yes  perhaps. But you claim that singapore no shortage what  and everyone already have 6-8 packs of masks at standby,btohqsg
Ok I will take you on that.Why canâ€™t Govt just buyback all masks on the private market and nationalise the sales of mask? decide to sell each household 1 box via the RC/CCs  no panic buy possible.,btohqsg
