UCL winner must have beat ex cup holder and stay undefeated thruout the tournament.Which one man c or chelsea,btohqsg
This one wait afc cup afc cl hoot tampines geylang games üòÇ,btohqsg
Tampines sure whacked by gamba jeonbuk sydney,btohqsg
Btw my observation in sinkie league. Usually its the opposite  if odds looks like low scoring game (doesnt drop/alot)   likely will be over 1.5HT / 2.5FT. If drop like crazy  expect low scoring.If raining/drizzling  confirm low score. Like the other week Albi 0-0,btohqsg
Geylang sure whacked by kaya ganu,btohqsg

City alr won EPL  while chelsea kena sabo by var in FA. They likely gonna be very thirsty for cup,btohqsg
üòÇ Their defence Bai and DanBen sure kenna outpaced one,btohqsg

DBS Can Fund $2 Billion Bid for Citi India Unit  Bernstein Says1. DBS Group Holdings Ltd. has sufficient capital to bid for Citigroup Inc.‚Äôs consumer assets in India valued at S$2.7 billion ($2 billion) without needing to raise additional funds  Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts said.2. It‚Äôs a case of ‚Äúeither go big or go home‚Äù for DBS to further expand in India where the Singapore-based bank also acquired Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd. in November  Bernstein analysts led by Kevin Kwek wrote in a report Thursday. DBS Chief Executive Officer Piyush Gupta last month said he is interested in the U.S. bank‚Äôs assets that are for sale in the South Asian country  as well as in China  Taiwan and Indonesia.3. A takeover of Citi‚Äôs India unit would be DBS‚Äôs largest acquisition since 2001  when the Singapore firm spent $5.4 billion buying the Hong Kong unit formerly known as Dao Heng Bank Group Ltd. Among the U.S. bank‚Äôs assets for sale  India stands out as ‚Äúthe crown jewel ‚Äù Kwek wrote. Its credit card and wealth business would be attractive to any bidder given the country‚Äôs economic growth rate and population size  he added.4. In April  DBS said it would pay S$1.1 billion for a 13% chunk in China‚Äôs Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank Corp.  and Gupta has indicated an interest to raise the size of that stake.5. Including the amount spent on the Chinese bank  the Bernstein analysts assumed a total budget of S$4 billion for acquisitions this year  which would bring the bank‚Äôs common equity Tier 1 ratio down to 13.1%  from 14.3% as of March 30. While that would still be above the regulatory minimum requirements  it may impact the firm‚Äôs dividend payout for 2021  Kwek said. ‚ÄúBut to be fair  earnings momentum this year looks promising  and management rhetoric will likely be that it comes back later by way of earnings  and subsequently higher payouts ‚Äù Kwek said. ‚ÄúInvestors should ask: what does DBS believe it can do better than Citi?‚Äù,btohqsg
I remember after the buying of HK side,btohqsg
The share price drop a lot,btohqsg
Or at least the shareholders weren't too happy,btohqsg
1. According to a filing on SGX  Gupta  on May 20  sold 58 900 DBS shares at $29.75 per share.2. On May 17 and 18  Gupta had sold 150 000 and 100 000 shares in DBS at $29.89 and $29.50 apiece respectively  bringing the total amount netted (from the sale of shares on all three days) to $9.18 million.3. Gupta  who previously held a 0.097% stake in DBS comprising 2.48 million shares on May 17  now holds a 0.085% stake comprising 2.17 million shares in the group.,btohqsg
