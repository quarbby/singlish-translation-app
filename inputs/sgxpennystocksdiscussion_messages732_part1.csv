The good thing about Oceanus coming back to play is that finally we have a Micros player and a possible leader too.Hence  we might see others follow suit. Time to scan and lookaround.,btohqsg
Nice big mouth on 795 on GEAR. Some insti or funds will take below 800 and sell to the offer 840. seems a good and quick deal to hold for few months (4.7% gain),btohqsg

I would like to Give a Buy Call for GEO Energy $0.40. I see them trying hard to flush down with the small sells. I'm not impressed at all. Company holding $288 mil cash on hand. PE 2X but yet counter quite stingy now.I urge GEO board to do share buy backs and be steady too.,btohqsg
