Your Evening Read - 23 July 2021The Covid-19 Delta variant took the world by storm. As a result  we are experiencing a more contagious variant contributing to several travel restrictions abroad and locally in several developed economies. This is a worrying sign as cyclical stocks are pushing ahead for more gains on the backdrop of pent-up demand in a post-pandemic world.In this episode  we will explore the Airline sector  a vital pillar of the aviation and employment outlook in the US. So let‚Äôs roll on that.A look at American Airlines (AAL)Based on the latest earning results  US airlines had a splendid comeback. Take American Airlines Group (AAL)  which exceeded estimates for both revenue and earnings in the quarter. The expected adjusted loss was $2.03 per share  but it registered a better result of $1.69 per share. With the federal payroll support and tax credits  AAL turned into a profit of $19 million  a 3 cents per share.It is also shifting gear to the pre-pandemic capacity. As a result  it is expected to fly by about 90% of its domestic seat capacity and roughly 80% of its international segment this summer. Nonetheless  its route to pretax profits might take longer than its legacy competitors  United Airlines (UAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL)  as AAL has a considerable debt load. Despite having plans to pay down these debts  as an article notes  it continued to be a burden on its balance sheet in the near term.A Stronger Balance Sheet in Southwest Airlines (LUV)On the other spectrum  LUV appears to have the most robust balance sheet among the carriers. It has substantial exposure to domestic leisure travel  which is one of Pika World‚Äôs favourites. With a healthy financial situation and riding on the tailwind of domestic travel  it should see a joy of profits in the reopening economy.The recent quarter result was less pleasing. Although revenue hits expectation  the earnings per share disappointed investors as jet fuel prices drag the bottom line. Nonetheless  with healthy ticket booking trends and that leisure traffic had rebounded above 2019 levels on a decent fare level  LUV can have a definite trend ahead.It is with sunshine in a cloudy skyChallenges are always plenty and surface when investors least expect them. At Pika World  we do have some concerns about the sector despite our generally optimistic outlook. First  jet fuel prices have risen sharply in the past months  which is eating into operating profit. Second  the fall travel season also sees seasonally weak leisure demand  and airlines would have to see substantial corporate travel to exceeds Wall Street‚Äôs rising targets.Next  as our opening suggests  Delta variant is showing its teeth that could likely moderate travel momentum or even stall the growth if travel restrictions are put in place. Unfortunately  despite Europe‚Äôs reopening of borders to US Citizens  President Biden is less willing to lift travel restrictions for visitors from Europe  including major Asian economies such as China and India.The 2H2021 trading and investing journey will face many bumps along the way. As we made adjustments in this mid-cycle economic transition  a stroll is perhaps a wiser pace than a sprint.Have the best of the day.Cheers  Pika Nat.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a broader audience.,btohqsg
