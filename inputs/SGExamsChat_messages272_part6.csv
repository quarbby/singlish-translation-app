I'm thinking if I wanna venture into application chemist roles,btohqsg
But I gotta be dman laojiao for that,btohqsg

You can just join and make friends :‚Äô),btohqsg
so sorry I‚Äôm not NUS :(,btohqsg
pure bio is alot of memorisation,btohqsg
omg did u see theres actually a nus chat bot,btohqsg
where u can talk to random ppl,btohqsg
The creator is here in this grp,btohqsg
yepp@funsizedfiestyfluffbut do stay safe and be careful with your personal info too! :)(and if any of you aren‚Äôt from the uni then do use the nation-wide bot instead and not the uni bots!),btohqsg
Thanks for creating the bots! May i know if you are looking for admins?,btohqsg
Haha I‚Äôm starting off with ppl I know well (and know I can trust) first! But yep you can DM me and I‚Äôll get back to you on a later date! :),btohqsg
Thank you for creating the bots! It was a very nice initiative on your part!,btohqsg
sialah guys i got no motivation to study for olvls alr   any advice?,btohqsg
I also got no motivation but what keeps me going is poly lol,btohqsg
Also the fact that after Os  we're pretty much free from all the bullshit subjects we hate.,btohqsg
So ig if you keep that in mind???,btohqsg
yea thinking about poly is good and all that but shit man it‚Äôs becoming so stagnant and i dont have teachers to ask for help when im stuck I always hve to learn it myself like idk bro fuck,btohqsg
YeahPoly life is like working lifeMany of the times we have to depend on ourselves :(,btohqsg
Also maybe set a huge reward for urself at the end of Os  regardless of results. Like  ik people who got tattoos after Os as a treat (cough doing that) or ppl who bought themselves nice laptops,btohqsg
expect self learning to be the normidk about JC but in poly I feel like I have to rely on myself to self learn if not I start lagging behind,btohqsg
Idk in jc im alr self learning stuff ahead whenever i had a chance so that i dont drown in my academics  kinda like giving myself some leeway,btohqsg
Wait why are secondary kids in my grp of uni chat,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure he is sec,btohqsg
Not judging or anything  just asking,btohqsg
Tbh jp it‚Äôs rlly not bad their rp 72?,btohqsg
Congratulations! I thot u said Pfizer at first,btohqsg
Messed up sight reading and improv but they didn't seem to care since I was doing both piano and vocals,btohqsg
anyone know where to get reasonable priced bicycles rn decathalon out of stock lmao,btohqsg
lol i just bought a foldie for $800,btohqsg
honestly decent bikes is all around that price rite,btohqsg
can't say it was an well informed choice  just going with what my friend uses & after trying it out myself,btohqsg
uh yeah decent entry level would expect around 1k,btohqsg
at this point I'm not even hunting for cheap I'm just hunting for stock,btohqsg
but i'm no bike nerd so actually not sure  just saying what my friends say HAHA,btohqsg
where did you buy from ah,btohqsg
but buying at a physical shop still the best,btohqsg
i had to do some manual adjustments cause it wasn't finely tuned,btohqsg
but depends on what parts you have to adjust la  mine was just things like hammering the L bracket a lil (for folding) and touching the gearbox a little,btohqsg
yea I think going bike shop probs a better idea hahahaha,btohqsg
but cheaper to buy online ma...,btohqsg
cheaper so it comes with is shortcomings,btohqsg
Cos my mother said as long as I go JC can already,btohqsg
