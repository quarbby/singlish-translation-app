Hi there  I got the amaze and Citi rewards.1. Came to Realise there is one percent charge after minimum $1000 spending. Is this a new update  or is this something that is previously known ?2. There is a 50 Cent charge for every small charge also  but they put it as 1%. is it still worth it to use this on a daily basis as it city point+insta points afterwards?,btohqsg
It has been there for many months. Minimum 50 cents charge. Only for local spend. And CRMC don't give bonus rewards after 1k also anyway.,btohqsg
no  only bonus saver credit/debit card counted,btohqsg
Instapoints are earned only on foreign currency iirc. And the 1% charge is only for local spends. So it’s not possible for them to coincide,btohqsg
buy online/offline? how much? which merchant? do a search on heymax/minstant.,btohqsg

For Tiger Brokers Welcome Campaign they gave so many cash vouchers in $5  Is it even worth using them? Anyone have tips and tricks to share?,btohqsg
Just Got some random charge from this Alo sim in USD how do I report this to UOB ?,btohqsg
report fraud in app  then call the hotline listed,btohqsg
Don’t know how they manage to charge it to my credit card,btohqsg
very normal.. all credit cards can get brute force attack,btohqsg
Not that hard to do so. Card details are just combination of numbers,btohqsg
I remember getting one on my city bank card too on some Gym membership in US for 30US dollar. City bank auto reimbursed me before I did anything,btohqsg
Best to report fraud and get new card. Unless you don't mind paying it and getting more fraudulent transactions lol,btohqsg
Will report it tomorrow  still need to use my card today 🤣,btohqsg
Hi all  if I buy something at overseas  I pay with Amaze+Citi  do I still get 4mpd?,btohqsg
depends on what you bought  but yes if it is not an exclusion you will get 4mpd,btohqsg
Depend on MCC  but general shopping wise should be fine. Should get 4mpd  provided u have not reach the monthly $1000 cap,btohqsg
Ok  thanks ☺️ just worry that it will consider as FCY,btohqsg
No worries :))Just rmb to pay with amaze not ur citi card  all good then 🙂🙂🙂,btohqsg
Can i find the fx rate of sgd vs myr of uob cc ?,btohqsg
Minor correction. Google pay via Kris+ is online. Crmc didn't get pts bcuz it explicitly excludes mobile wallet (google pay  apple pay).,btohqsg
Just check Mastercard/visa rate then add 3.25%,btohqsg
Good luck then... You might be liable for fraudulent charges since you didn't dispute it at the first instance. FYI your logon sessions are logged for audit. Cannot pretend you only spotted it tomorrow.,btohqsg

Hi guys  which option is better for credit card spend in Japan?1) Amaze + crmc  uobL  uobKF  ocbcR2) naked uob visa signature3) trust/youtripUob visa signature should be the most expensive even though 4mpd correct?Trust and youtrip should give the best rate but no rewards and amaze combo is middle rate but with rewards?,btohqsg

hihi I would like to ask if I use up my credit limit  will the annual fee be auto waive off?,btohqsg

Hi gurus  does everyone know for Citi rewards  when you make an ecommerce refund of eg $200  but your transaction already posted and you earned your points  and the refund just nice only get registered when a new spending month window opens  does it mean the old points get removed (200*10) or in the new window you need 1200 sgd instead of 1000 sgd to max out getting all the points for the new month?,btohqsg
Any good promo for priority banking? Got some funds to park somewhere  hopefully get some good interest and welcome benefits,btohqsg

Hi guys  if I exceed $1000 local spend on my amaze+crmc and was charged 1%. If I use my amaze+uob lady to spend locally  will I get charged  1% again. Thanks,btohqsg
Yes  the limit is for Amaze. Doesn’t matter if you link to another card  you have already exceed Amaze’s limit.,btohqsg
Not much reason to use amaze + UOB lady locally. Unless you want to avoid DCC in Agoda.,btohqsg

Hi  can I check  does instarem amaze $1000 spending limit cycle reset on 1st or on card activation date?,btohqsg
You click the little ? Bubble in the card page on the limit it will pop up detailed,btohqsg
My existing CitiRewards billing cycle is on every 5th and the CSO told me the only other options are 10th/15th. So it would be closest for me to track my CRMC + amaze limit together if I just stick with the 5th ya?,btohqsg
Yeah just stick with that  my is also 5th plus on Citi side is not immediate posting so from 1-5th for the month some transactions might flow over anyway,btohqsg
