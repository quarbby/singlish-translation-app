Hi would like to ask if we are applying for the MCPS does it affect if it’s the co-occupier rather than the main applicant’s parents lives nearer to the bto site that they are applying for?,btohqsg
Or must be main applicant viewpoint only?,btohqsg
The parents of applicant 2 can be the “parents-in-law” of applicant 1,btohqsg
Hi just to clarify  will the x% subsidy clawback by on resale price of the unit? Or will be on the grants provided?,btohqsg
Hello! Is there already info on how many floors each project has for Oct launch? Thanks!,btohqsg
Anybody know about this? Did they change to not able to apply a certain project?,btohqsg
Hi just to ask how long after applying will it take to be able to book the flat,btohqsg
They combine the area project tgt,btohqsg
hi  can i check around when will sbf projects be released for our consideration? (since feb 2025 bto projects out ler),btohqsg
Mean cannot choose without the project ah,btohqsg
hi  wanna check  if i want to reassess my loan before the project is ready  will it affect my EHG?,btohqsg
Cannot  have to ballot when u got q number then can choose when its ur turn,btohqsg
Depends on queue number too but minimumly 2 months i think,btohqsg
more than that la.. they only issue queue number around 2months. after that wait till they schedule appointment,btohqsg
So just pray the q number u get is as low as possible so u can choose the projevt u want?,btohqsg
Will they allocate which project u got for u?,btohqsg
Not really but ur queue number plays a huge part,btohqsg
No depends which flat left on any project when its ur turn,btohqsg
Oh okay thanks . Cause my first time applying.  But if I put my child as a priority. Is there higher chance to flat booking .,btohqsg
Ok thanks man . Anyway Goodluck guys,btohqsg
Im married with a child but my sister not yet married . She gets a Q number faster than me .,btohqsg
So everything is luck one . If is yours is yours,btohqsg
I see . So it's after the balloting then got queue number right,btohqsg
yes la.. the actual queue number will be sent to applicant around 2 months after closing date,btohqsg
If we dont get a queue number would we be notified too?,btohqsg
near the date will have people reporting about missing profile pic.. you get to that nearer the date,btohqsg
this round it is unlikely not to get a queue number since there are so many projects and the highest number of units.. its more of getting queue number within supply and a good number to chose good units,btohqsg
hdb issues 3x queue number in anticipation of dropouts,btohqsg
Pasir Ris 5 rm isit overprice?,btohqsg
Hope I can get to book for the flat because my only 88 units,btohqsg
its 5yrs Standard.. so expect to pay more for the amenities and mrt + seaview,btohqsg
Can I check any additional subsidies for plus projects? Apart from the existing grants,btohqsg
Itll be a percentage of the resale or valuation price (whichever higher!),btohqsg
Does anyone know if I apply for deferred payment scheme am I still entitled for ehg or any grants?,btohqsg
hi can i check if the prices for the btos shown are before or after subsidies?,btohqsg
I believe so  the deferred payment should be separate from the grants eligibility,btohqsg
May i know the expected completion date for the bto houses,btohqsg
Can check the project page links  under est waiting time  look at the ? They will state ECD eg this is Pasir Ris one  q3 2028,btohqsg
this kind of combined BTO is quite dangerous  unless you really ok with all 3 projects.I applied for Queenstown bundled project  queue number 2.8k+  took almost a year for them to call me up and by then  I already applied for 2 other projects and got a better queue number.Now with the new changes  you can't even get another queue number if you are within quota.,btohqsg
Wow the clawback is very high,btohqsg
Anyone know where can I check the bto price? Thank you 🙏🏼,btohqsg
Can I check if the selling price including grants applies to everyone or it’s dependent on the grant amount that’s given by HDB?,btohqsg
You should look at excluding grants then subtract the amount of grants given to you.The including grants price uses the highest grants which won’t be accurate unless you are getting the highest grant,btohqsg
