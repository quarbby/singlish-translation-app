I see thanks!! üôè. Will read up more into optimising my return tgt with krismiles,btohqsg
Just like to highlight krisflyer not yet a transfer partner of heymax,btohqsg
Yeap ik   thanks. But we can still used the heymax miles to redeem for flight ticket bought via SQ or scoot rightThen used Krisflyer miles to upgrade to business?,btohqsg
I suppose so. Usually i just use full miles for redemption,btohqsg
Max miles have good use case to offset econ tix or low cost carriers to nearby destinations.,btohqsg
I supposed miles valuation also fluctuates with times  mostly is depreciating right?,btohqsg
Even domestic flights w it is good,btohqsg
Econ ticket means any ticket say from SG to Japan which cost $1.2k also can redeem?  Say via SIA or Japan Airlines?,btohqsg
U will need 60 plus k heymax miles for 1.2k ticket,btohqsg
So essentially  to redeem  its the cost of the ticket x 0.018 yeah,btohqsg
I am thinking more of those in the range of 200-500sgd.,btohqsg
For example if i have 5000 miles  i can claim 5000x0.018 which is 90?,btohqsg
Miles have to enough for full ticket cost. U cant claim partial i think,btohqsg
Yeap that‚Äôs why I read up.So with some sites offering 4max miles per $  is that considered high as compared to credit card giving 4mpd on revo or lady etcc,btohqsg
It does not interfere with the credit card reward system. It is a stack up infact.So u can see 4 heymax miles similar to 4 mpd given by card. Just that it can only be use in heymax eco system,btohqsg
max miles is max miles  card rewards is card rewards. These two coexist,btohqsg
Ik but from a miles valuation perspective,btohqsg
‚ÄúSo u can see 4 heymax miles similar to 4 mpd given by card. Just that it can only be use in heymax eco system‚ÄùOk Understood!!,btohqsg
Miles valuation is very subjective. Like i find buying miles at 1 cent per miles is ex but some other can find it attractive for example.,btohqsg
Sorry for the dumb question but how do people derive these miles valuation? CPM..,btohqsg
U can see chris video on youtube,btohqsg
So 4mpd us essentially 25cents per miles,btohqsg
25c per mile is extremely high :),btohqsg
Hi all  1 question i booked hotel on agoda(free cancelation deal)using my ocbc card to hit the sgd500 spend criteria in jun  now i found a better deal on agoda and would like to cancel last month booking and rebook another hotel.Question: does it affect my last month(jun) 500 spending interest bonus ?,btohqsg
I think u will have to clock more for this month,btohqsg
Should affect  similarly to UOB one account card refunds (since it means u never spent the money),btohqsg
planning to apply for Maybank F&F cc  does anyone know what‚Äôs the typical statement date? would help with planning my expenses this month,btohqsg
Cashback goes by calendar month and posting date anyway,btohqsg
by calendar month you mean if i apply now  i have only 20 more days to hit the $800 min spend?,btohqsg
Yes. Only transactions posted by 31-July will count,btohqsg
This is Ocbc 360 account. Can anyone explain why the numbers doesn‚Äôt seem right? My account has slightly more than 100k  even if it‚Äôs 100k shouldn‚Äôt the interest be more than this?,btohqsg
I see the card in hsbc app in one week  just see it on this Sunday actually,btohqsg
Looks correct to me. Rmb june has 30 days for interest calculation.,btohqsg
They use Monthly Available Balance (MAB) to calculate. You need to check your monthly statement to see the MAB for the month.,btohqsg
Hi can I check if monthly CPF contribution + bonus already meet the annual CPF limit   CPF will refund any voluntary top up (MA or SA)  question is do we still enjoy tax relief ?,btohqsg
Gives take photo with fork on head vibes,btohqsg
I think you're confusing VC3A with VCMA and RSTU. VCMA is only limited by BHS and RSTU is only limited by FRS.Your employer's contributions would be refunded if excess of annual contribution limit.,btohqsg
Anyone know what card to use for mcc 8699 for miles,btohqsg
Have you triedheymax.ai? It's a great tool to check what card to use.,btohqsg
Hi all  if I charge $4k to insurance can it be considered as $2k spend on Maybank platinum card ?,btohqsg
No. For tier (300/1000/2000) calculations only half can be insurance (150/500/1000),btohqsg
If you split 1k to pay with CardUp  yes.,btohqsg
For $2k tier insurance is allowed up to $1k only  rest $1k must be non-insurance,btohqsg
You said $4k insurance premium clocks full $2k spend.,btohqsg
You are giving him false information. It‚Äôs not like half of the insurance counted. Only half of the tier requirement can be fulfilled with insurance  the other halfmust benon-insurance,btohqsg
Hi. My hubby and me did the fast transfer via uob and the paynow via ocbc to each other with salary description. We did not get the salary bonus for 360 account. Any idea what went wrong? Thank you.,btohqsg
I c so meaning even I charge 5k insurance still only 1k is counted,btohqsg
What mechanic? Bonus interest calculation? Most banks calculate bonus interest with MAB. You can check their t&c to be sure.,btohqsg
Can I pay the other $1k with card up?,btohqsg
Yes I just said it earlier. Pay $1k directly  $1k with CardUp.The rest can GIRO through HSBC EGA or pay using eligible UOB cards to clock min spend for UOB One account (then GIRO cc payment through HSBC EGA).,btohqsg
