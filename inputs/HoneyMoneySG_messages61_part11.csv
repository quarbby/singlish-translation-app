How to do cimb bank saving account for new user in order to get 3.5%?,btohqsg
The world is a truly scary place,btohqsg
This is why we need to work for our own Financial Independence through legal/ethical/safe ways and not think of getting rich fast. Once you are able to generate a sustainable source of income apart from the day job  you will then worry less about money and fall into greed/scam things.,btohqsg
But sometime it is just pure kidnapped or spike into drink etc if in thai  laos  [worst myanmar] etc. So still need to be very careful. Even if rich.,btohqsg
Yes  this one is more about social awareness. Don't accept drinks from strangers  or just don't go,btohqsg
https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/cards/infinity-unlimited-cashback-card?looks like OCBC quietly just introduced a new CB card?Nothing to shout about though lol,btohqsg
Not bad  at least itâ€™s a qualifying card for 360 account,btohqsg
What's the cap for cimb 3.5% ?,btohqsg
I fund the account only on Mar and May  when I put money in  I don't take it out and it is a large sum. I am getting less than half of my expected amount.,btohqsg
It is stated on CIMB website. You may want to visit website to understand more on this.,btohqsg
Hi sifu  you can try to get what is your ADB for each of the promo months from their live chat in the app. Once you have those figures  you can do counter check with what you received?,btohqsg
I think no cap  unlike SCB eSaver = $2mil,btohqsg
Chris  correct me if I am wrong?,btohqsg
Did you sms to register the promo?The interest will be credited into your accounts using few transactions across 1-2 weeks.  wait till month end then you will know the final amount.,btohqsg
I registered SMS once  the Mar 2023 bonus interest programme was for 4 months. I have only seen the first deposit  if it is for the first month of the four months  then it is about right. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
It is for 1st month only. 3 to go,btohqsg
Morning guysDoes anyone know if purchases at fortytwo website qualify for 10x cash back for OCBC titanium card?,btohqsg
Good morning  will (uob one card) quarterly cash-rebate affect the spending for that month? Example if I spend $500  quarterly cash-rebate $50  the spending for $500 will not drop to $450 right?,btohqsg
Goodmorning all  can we earn Citi rewards or uob lady points if we top up to amaze wallet?Asking this due to the reduction of instapoint when link to cards,btohqsg
Need to understand the definition of spending and outstanding bill. The two amount have different meaning.,btohqsg
Firstly  you need to check what is the mcc code of Fortytwo. You can search usinghttps://heymax.aiThen check OCBC Titanium TnC is it in whitelist.,btohqsg
Thks so much. Code is 5712. Not in the list. However  Ikea (also 5712) is included in their list,btohqsg
1). Use digibot to check what is the mcc codehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/701192). Check is the mcc code in the credit card exclusion list.,btohqsg
New is to bank or to acccount?,btohqsg

Hi  for OCBC credit card spend of 500 to qualify for OCBC 360 CC bonus interest  is the spending including or excluding cash back amount?,btohqsg
My plan is to spend $500 each month for that quarter  so the uob one card cash rebate( from previous quarter) will offset the outstanding bills.. it will not affect my spending of $500 for my new quarter right?,btohqsg
Hi guys  Iâ€™ve been using 2 credit cards for 2-3 years and want to cancel one of them to apply for another one. Will this affect my credit score?Concerned cos Iâ€™ve planned for a big purchase next year and will prob need a bank loan. Iâ€™m just not sure how soon is too soon that risks affecting credit score when applying for another card. Any advice appreciated!,btohqsg
Had frequent credit check mentioned in my credit report . But since I pay off everything every month credit remained excellent. Probably will impact in some way if you are not in all clear status .,btohqsg
The cash rebate is equivalent to your payment to settle your outstanding bill. It will not affect your total spending amount. You must hit minimum qualified spend every month to get cash rebate.I m more interest on how your spend exactly $500 every month on your credit card.ðŸ˜€,btohqsg
Thanks for confirming.. the $500 is just an example ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
just apply one card no impact,btohqsg
Thanks Julie. I also pay my bills pretty much on time. Just that I hardly use the other card that I want to cancel.The credit report u got is from the credit bureau for $8++ right?,btohqsg
if u applied card from another bank  u should get a free credit bureau report,btohqsg
Oh! I'll try ask  thanks for this ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
Yeah   he is right . When you apply and approve   you will get it free .. so itâ€™s good to â€˜apply for a card â€˜ before you seek mortgageâ€¦ :),btohqsg
