Hey guys  Those using UOB absolute Amex. How do u guys pay the bill? Iâ€™m having problem doing it though DBS ibanking. Canâ€™t seem to add the card. It shows invalid,btohqsg
I often pay using FAST. I treat UOB Abs card as if it's an UOB account. If need to pay bill  I transfer to UOB Abs card from any bank account lor.,btohqsg
Ah  I was trying the â€˜pay card billâ€™ function,btohqsg
If dbs cant pay your uob just use axs,btohqsg
Don't need to  bank transfer will do,btohqsg
Haha they feel I got too many UOB cards  donâ€™t want give me lol.  I always pay full on time also ðŸ¤£,btohqsg

ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚so I suppose I got so many,btohqsg
Even u apply all.. if u eligible I tink they will issue? Cuz all share same credit limit anyway,btohqsg
Think so but end of days it's up to Bank to decide we won't know,btohqsg
Yea I just wait for their reply. Yesterday I called they say pending lol,btohqsg
Pending ok at least got hope,btohqsg
If say rejected then u know what do next,btohqsg
Probably cancel all my cards lol,btohqsg
Since they donâ€™t valued u as customer,btohqsg
Maybe due to surge or application,btohqsg

Would like to ask if using UOB one card to set up installment payments (eg interest free payments on iPhone  computer) count toward the $500/$1000/$2000 spent for higher interest on UOB one account?,btohqsg

Hi All  for UOB Absolute Card  when will the cash back be reflected?,btohqsg
Signature or not. How did you pay?- Online- Paywave/Masterpass- Chip based- Swipe,btohqsg

I am not sure.The sales person slot my card into the machine then asked me for my signature.Stated as EMV sale on the transaction slip,btohqsg
Should count anyway regardless of signature. When was the transaction date,btohqsg
12 Dec 22. Transaction changed from pending to completed on 14 Dec,btohqsg
