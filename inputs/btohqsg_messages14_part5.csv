U can only applied under single scheme if u r >35yrs old for 2 room flex if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
In previous year  Aug 2021 BTO released on 11 Aug and AUG 2020 BTO released on 12 AUG,btohqsg
A bit off topic but anyone has heard of or experience with staying near public rental blocks? Can't get BTO so was looking at resales but one of the units is near those public rental scheme blocks (not the parenthood type),btohqsg
yes  it's fine. We cut through one of those blocks every morning and it's low income and an elderly activity center below. It's not the most salubrious in terms of decor but it's like any other HDB block in my opinion.,btohqsg
If u have crazy neighbours  is the worst experience,btohqsg
Crazy neighbours can be from anywhere in my opinion  not only from rental blocks. I live opposite a rental block but nothing wrong with that block  it's just like any other HDB blocks.,btohqsg
..do avoid super old estate especially the studio type rental flats...but best is to walk around the resale estate that u are considering....,btohqsg
Oh? Why avoid super old studio flats?,btohqsg

Hi are there any grants for 5rm BTO flat for first timers ?,btohqsg
If I first time bto and live near my parents  will there be any grants?,btohqsg
Does this apply for bto? Proximity grant,btohqsg
it says for any resale  so not for bto,btohqsg
Cause govt say that BTO is technically subsidised already,btohqsg
You just get EHG based on ur income.,btohqsg
Nowadays 5 room bto can be 500k - 600k,btohqsg
but resale also cost >$600k for 5rm without the wait.. i guess its give and take.This is SG..  unfortunately  housing pricings will be on the higher side.,btohqsg
Hi all  any idea when is the selection for BTO for Bukit Merah ridge is starting?,btohqsg
HDB website stating Aug starting but till now still haven't receive any invitation for the selection process,btohqsg
U can call hdb and ask for the date if u hv a queue no.,btohqsg
They will only let u know nearer to ur queue number,btohqsg
They can only let u know nearer ur no. Cos some pple will give up or change appointment,btohqsg

Hi  just wanna ask if letâ€™s say my parents house and the new bto site is around 5.4-5.7km. Which is out of the 4km range  can we still apply under that scheme?Like for example I stay at Sembawang but the bto site is at Yishun but is out of the 4km,btohqsg
Already say 4km  means 4km  If u like that can get very unfair to other ppl already,btohqsg
er i think you can try but the system might just reject your application altogether since it does not adhere to the application guidelines,btohqsg
Must within 4km from your parent's home,btohqsg
this apply for resale only right?,btohqsg
Iâ€™m just asking HAHA thanks anyway,btohqsg
For resale  within 4km you get a grant (phg)For bto  within 4km its a scheme (mcps) where for 1st timers up to 30% of flats are allocated to the scheme,btohqsg
if applying for BTO with parents as the occupants  is it considered mcps?,btohqsg
i recommend you try to apply and if rejected make an appeal. with the sembawang airbase in the vicinity  its tough to meet the 4km radius guideline. that's what I plan to do.,btohqsg
Book appt - get q no. - go down hdb hq - choose the unit available to you - put in option fee,btohqsg
Q no is first come first serve better to use the best internet you can get. The better flats gets booked extremely fastðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
If open flat never go down / book  not considered as forfeit one time right??,btohqsg
Hi anyone have group link for Feb 2022 bto @ grove spring Yishun?,btohqsg
Hi  just wanna know if can buy a resale flat while waiting for the BTO project to be completed?,btohqsg
That i am not too sure. I only know that if put in option fee already cannot forfeit if not for 1 year cannot apply for new flats,btohqsg
Don't think can. cause when you buy a resale flat. there is a 5year MOP.,btohqsg
Hdb resale levy is to be paid back to govt ya?,btohqsg
If the BTO takes 6 years to complete?,btohqsg
while in MOP  you are unable to apply for BTO,btohqsg
