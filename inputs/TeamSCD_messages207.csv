Sgcar mart is very fake in their reviews.  It seems like they are paid to give false good reviews.  Otherwise how they survive,btohqsg

Take their car reviews with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
Car reviews don't only read from one source,btohqsg
I also ask for opinion here and car forums. Lol,btohqsg
But as long you buy new  doesn't matter as long you got warranty,btohqsg
