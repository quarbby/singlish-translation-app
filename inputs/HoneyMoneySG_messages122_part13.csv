hi whats the best card to use when booking flights onTrip.com? I'm aware sometimes some platforms will charge in local currency hence will kenna a foreign currency charge. How do I know what currency they will charge me in?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
Can I check if buying discounted food vouchers (eg. Tunglok restaurant) from KRIS+ App gives 4MPD on HSBC Revo?,btohqsg
In my opinion.  Best card to kris pay is revolution hsbc.,btohqsg
Risky. May fall into 5814 then no bonus miles.,btohqsg
Bro. Most of the restaurants that use in kris pay is not 5814.Eg. Tung lok.Canto paradise.And some hotel buffets.,btohqsg
If is mcc 5814.  To use citi rewards amaze,btohqsg
Good to use under kris pay are.Puma   G2000  shirt bar,btohqsg
Those bros that like crab. Can also book kris pay for dancing crab. 5812 mcc,btohqsg
If really no use for OA  transfer to SA  do VCMA/RSTU until cap for tax reliefs  additionally can rely on SRS contribution for more tax reliefs also. But SRS need to invest if not 0.05% p.a.,btohqsg
Just set it up yourself. Create payments plan on CardUp  setup eGIRO and cancel the eGIRO arrangement after (through bank). The system will revert it to Cash premiums  which your CardUp payments will fulfil.,btohqsg
Why not just pay with the Fairprice app? It's Online also.,btohqsg
OP won't even be qualified for 50k if they specifically registered for 100k.,btohqsg
Always safer to verify against statement or CSO. And DBS-HSBC EGA GIRO is the worst to set-up.,btohqsg
Iftrip.comcharges you in sgd u can use Uob lady with travel category for up to 6mpd.If in foreign currency. Use amaze + Uob lady with travel category.,btohqsg

Can I check if using Citi rewards card by itself to set as recurring for GOMO payment will I still earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Have to pair with amaze then possible?,btohqsg
just manually pay the bill online every month,btohqsg

"Recurring payments in general will bypass the ""online"" mechanism for citi cards (I use Simba not Gomo but the logic is the same)",btohqsg
luckily its not an Amex deal or he would've came running to this,btohqsg

Hi gurus i got a question for UOB lady card (the 1k limit de) and have selected the travel category already. I am planning to spend 2k on airline tickets and was wondering the 1k limit is based on billing cycle or is it month end 2359hrs ah,btohqsg
My thought process currently is planning to book at 31st July at 2350hrs and once the clock strikes 0000 on 1st August i will book the remaining ticket to maximise the 4mpd,btohqsg
Does it work this way or am i delulu hahahah,btohqsg
Posting date  meaning it has to clear the pending statement in my transaction correct?,btohqsg

Depends on the merchant  but usually at least 2 days.,btohqsg

Transaction has to be posted  not pending.,btohqsg
