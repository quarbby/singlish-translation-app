Idh the time for this im not that desperate for u anyways,btohqsg
so i just didnt turn up for the interview,btohqsg
"I was very much like ""know your worth"" and i was like pls if NTU makes me ABA for their course im like I aint got time for that shit",btohqsg
apart from people telling me im too bouncy/energetic,btohqsg
why wud u ever wanna go ej,btohqsg
Apparently my cohort did badly for their first GP wa tested mainly on summary P2 and just AQ,btohqsg
Okay ngl thats a bad way of testing,btohqsg
u should either do full paper,btohqsg
its q popular wat  newer campus and we are in the northeast area,btohqsg
I mean it is what it is,btohqsg
The SAQs check if you understand major details and concepts in the author text before you critique it at a micro levelThe SQ checks if you understand major details and concepts in the author's text before you critique it at a macro levelThe AQ is the overall critique,btohqsg
it can very easily lead to students not knowing wtf theyre writing,btohqsg
Uk end up Cher gave 1 PT 1 mark for summary,btohqsg
just sitting in the corner  no idea abt gp,btohqsg
Because otherwise alotta ppl would have failed failed,btohqsg
i feel the way schs teach summary,btohqsg
i find it easier to do summary,btohqsg
if you cancel out what is irrelevant,btohqsg
rather than find what is relevant,btohqsg
Altho she got mention that it's not the real As marking scheme,btohqsg
But idt anyone gives a shit yet because they're taking it next yr,btohqsg
oh i used this example to teach,btohqsg
Ye iirc 2-3 PT 1 mark is it,btohqsg
relative vs absolute importance for GP,btohqsg
normally its q standard 15 pts for full 8 marks,btohqsg
but sometimes if the text has less points then they will adjust,btohqsg
so it can actually be 1 pt 1 mark,btohqsg
I wish i had more gp students,btohqsg
isit called tagging people or @ing ppl,btohqsg
maybe i shud monetise my worksheets,btohqsg
Only the ogs will know paging,btohqsg
It's my own self designed worksheets,btohqsg
And when I designed it I tried to make it so that people can do it without extra guidance,btohqsg
So its more of a platform to bounce ideas off,btohqsg
Like if u do it with someone,btohqsg
"Fyi AQ qn was "" To what extent should multiculturalism policies smth smth in your society "" LOL I can't rmb alrd but alot of ppl misinterpreted the qn as ""oh yes there should be multiculturalism policies in my society"" or smth",btohqsg
But ppl simply wrote oh there should be such policies in our society,btohqsg
Okay nvm I need see the full preamble,btohqsg
Cambridge hasn't tested topics where u need such high barriers to understand the content before,btohqsg
Oh yea also across my cohort highest was 6/12 or smth,btohqsg
The closest was 2018 abt political apathy,btohqsg
I forgot that's under which component for AQ/summary,btohqsg
So that students can properly answer it,btohqsg
Oh wait no ard 6-8 ISH only,btohqsg
Most students get 3/10 for aq last time,btohqsg
I am a firm believer of schs don't teach aq properly they just force fit a structure and make u like write it,btohqsg
They don't actuslly tell students why aq is even being tested in the first place,btohqsg
AND HONESTLY I FEEL IF U TELL THEM WHAT RHIS IS NATURALLY UR GRADES WILL GO UP,btohqsg
ngl I appreciate content dumping but my Cher doesn't rlly review the skill required to ATQ for AQ properly,btohqsg
like man I even have a GP self help guide book to guide my thought process,btohqsg
