Peel P50 has excellent braking  is it  a performance car?,btohqsg
When iPhone came out they didn‚Äôt target Nokia 3310 customers. Eventually it will trickle down to lower cost. For now  if you compare compact exec sedan  EVs are cheaper to buy and run.Why are you even going to a petrol station to charge? There‚Äôs shopping malls  parks etc. charge when you are doing other things,btohqsg
For $500K  I can think of a lot of options‚Ä¶ wow lots to consider. I might want something more special looking rather than a mass market  easily upbadgeable look. But all subjective lah. Everyone looks for different things in their car purchases. it is a most emotive purchase for many.,btohqsg
but it is what you want to believe. if it is not then it is not,btohqsg
Do you consider c43amg and m340i a performance car?Model 3 outhandles them,btohqsg
you cant conclude anything if you dont own it!,btohqsg
I wonder what will happen to existing? All ice become vintage status?,btohqsg
youd ont have to own it. you read from reviews of many users before you decide,btohqsg
can send stats or review vid haha i wanna send my C43 friend,btohqsg
Model 3 outdrags m3 and c63 0-130kmh,btohqsg
There‚Äôs numerous track videos  auto cross online (:,btohqsg
is it faster round the corners?,btohqsg
Well I agree there are stereotypes but compared to other driving stereotypes  EV drivers seem to be proving them right more often with aggressive driving practices,btohqsg
Eh YouTube  TikTok and IG video and other people say so leh. So must be true.,btohqsg
Depending on the track But have you realise it‚Äôs a 200k car vs 500k car üò±,btohqsg
exactly so how do you define performance car,btohqsg
hahaha... thi sis getting emotional. hitting nerves. many dont liek,btohqsg
HAHA its a question btw not being sarcastic or anyth,btohqsg
Do you think the brz is a performance car? No offence to brz owners,btohqsg
"Is a valid point ... Thats why i only got my iphone after the 5th gen .. haha .. I think the question is not if people will stick to ICE or EV   just when will they do the swapping.As to why go petrol station instead of shopping centres. Because when everyone starts to go to shopping mall to shop  the same situation will happen. There will be a constant need to remind yourself to find any possible means to charge while for ICE car  just drive in 1 min and u r done with ""charging"" your car .. haha",btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure can find lah. I search twitter,btohqsg
How is model s easily Upbadge lol it is not like bm or merc u just paste a sticker and then is done .The size is bigger   the look is different,btohqsg
But I agree that 500 k u have a lot of option,btohqsg
so u can have a dodge demon that is fast on the straights and slow on the corner and will name it a performance car?,btohqsg
Doge is a performance car what lol,btohqsg
exactly so now that is slow on the straights  do you call it a miataüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
as all rounder m3 is better than c63,btohqsg
It is a performance car. They veyron can‚Äôt turn it‚Äôs a performance car?,btohqsg
If you said doge demon is not a performance car then I nothing to said liao,btohqsg
Oh yeah hor. Good point. I stand corrected. There is difference. üëçüèº,btohqsg

Then you buy a Maserati! Loud and sexy,btohqsg
I will get an ice instead of ev,btohqsg
üòÇ okay what about your favourite giulia leh,btohqsg
maserati is like an army boy  5 days in workshop 2 days book out,btohqsg
