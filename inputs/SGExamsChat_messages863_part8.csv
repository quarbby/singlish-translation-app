Like I‚Äôm taking a lvls this yr no tution and stuff im just gonna use holy grail,btohqsg
Mmm tbh i didnt rlly outsource when i was doing j2,btohqsg
But approaching a levels  holy grail saved me,btohqsg
Idk if I shud get tution tbh,btohqsg
Like during jc u never got tution or Anyt?,btohqsg
Just holy grail and school notes?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm tryna retake during ns lol,btohqsg
Were u from a top tier jc,btohqsg
But wld say my score was not bad,btohqsg

If i recalled i did spam thru my tys during June holidays,btohqsg
Then i used whatever resources i had,btohqsg
For like other jcs prelim papers,btohqsg
I‚Äôm tryna retake to get 85+ this time,btohqsg
How come you want to score an 85 tho,btohqsg
‚ÄúTop tier jc notes‚Äù and specialised,btohqsg
So idk if I shud get it,btohqsg
And get the course I want,btohqsg
I missed it by a few rp,btohqsg
And I can retake in ns,btohqsg
But I think they lowkey scamming tho,btohqsg
Which course if you dont mind me asking?,btohqsg
Actually tbh for most scholarships would be ok with ppl having 80+ or above,btohqsg
i mean if you want to  you can go ahead and retake during ns  but honestly  i do believe your score is quite good uh,btohqsg
I have 3 courses I‚Äôm interested in lol,btohqsg
I only can enter 1 due to rp requirments,btohqsg
If not everyone in the nation can get a scholarship already by just 80+,btohqsg
i mean of course still need portfolio uh,btohqsg
I kinda messed up my sciences tho during As,btohqsg
but anyways  which courses are you interested in?,btohqsg
Wtf did i just see bro,btohqsg
Thats not how i anticipated seeing a dpic,btohqsg
i cannot believe i actually saw it,btohqsg
Personally I wouldnt recommend buying it,btohqsg
Esp for notes  I do find it like a waste of money,btohqsg
at most  you can find the notes in holy grail (ok tbh i dont know if can find notes in holy grail uh  but definitely past year prelims),btohqsg
i still do think that school notes are sufficient as notes,btohqsg
If you want buy from popular store   i was reading through r/SGExams and found that some ppl bought notes which are plagiarised from holy grail üò≥üò±üíÄ,btohqsg
lol at this rate i rather buy assessment bks instead of the plagarised notes,btohqsg
"speaking of which  do you know if holy grail has ""jc notes""?",btohqsg
i havent used it for a long time every since i finished a levels,btohqsg
"is that a qn or like are you saying like ""yes they do upload""?üòÇ",btohqsg
My material for pure math is up there but not recommended for now unless the person is in really desperate need üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
