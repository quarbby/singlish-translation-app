Just buy $1 to win the jackpot 😂,btohqsg
Yess great talking to you! Cheers and good night!!,btohqsg
If there is one classic car i could import. I think it would be a 300sl. Or maybe a eleanor mustang,btohqsg
It's like getting an SLS roadster instead of the gullwing,btohqsg
If could wanna ask bmw if can build another M1,btohqsg
Yall don’t know how to sleep is it,btohqsg
I've been doing stupid things like taking a nap at 9pm,btohqsg
End up waking at 1 or 2 am and  awake all night can't sleep,btohqsg
“New blood”… does remind me of something else 😅😅😅 now which channel did I hear that phrase from hmmm hmmm!! 🤔,btohqsg
Just continue to drive the A3 unless you can find a hybrid that you can buy without any top up. Because likely you will have to pay more road tax anyway.A3 no matter what still has good paper value.,btohqsg
Don’t make sense to me from my simple mind perspective. Running cost aside   you would be letting go of a car which you had bought at a good price  and replacing it with a new high book value car for what it is. Downgrade and sucking it up would be changing to a basic 6 year old Jap or Korean car for example,btohqsg
a little tough sell to suck it up and buy a new car sir ☺️,btohqsg
Huh? What do you mean sir? - J,btohqsg
https://fb.watch/exCoMgSUB1/NSX in Singapore can buy 4 NSX in north America 😅,btohqsg
That was the idea  but on hindsight  i think the 300sl is more expensive hahaha,btohqsg
Ya'll are very hardworking people leh helping us do research till 1am!! But yeah indeed the 'sports car' category is a very grey area. These days there are tons of 4-door cars that are also performance and driving oriented.,btohqsg
Hardcore new Porsche 911 GT3 RS to be revealed on 17 August 2022The Porsche 911 GT3 will be getting an even more hardcore brother in the form of the 911 GT3 RS!👉🏻 React with 🔥 if the 911 GT3 RS is your favourite Porsche!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
i talked to our ops team  it is indeed hard to define. Nowadays we try to determine it by the manufacturers intention. So it's not fixed based on a strict '2 door coupe' definition. Thats why you will see Type R  GTI etc being defined as sports cars,btohqsg
lucky mine is been defined as a luxury car,btohqsg
Which begs the question - would ya'll consider a high performance SUV to be a sports car?,btohqsg
nowadays sports car dont perform like sports car  and luxury car dont perform like luxury car,btohqsg
That is very logical indeed to go by manufacturers’ intent.,btohqsg
Which then begs the question: what characteristic(s) define a sports car?,btohqsg
Not to me personally. I would though consider the mx5 to be a sports car: well build engine  light weight  low  great handling.,btohqsg
Looks and a few sticker here and there,btohqsg
Like suv   vezel is consider a suv ? Or just a sedan with high heels,btohqsg
Hahahaha yeah more and more so these days,btohqsg
Sports car is more of a mentality of the driver   like an Audi A3 slap with a few sticker   and change exhaust also is a sports car,btohqsg
Even a vezel with rs sticker is also like driving a sports car,btohqsg
Ya so it like a hatchback with high heels la haha,btohqsg
So like Suzuki Swift Sport also count too?,btohqsg
I see no relevance of been a suv with cramp interior   front wheel drive   low power engine and poor handling,btohqsg
It more like marketing terms now,btohqsg
sg dun really need SUV. mlysia maybe where there's a lot kampung bumpy roads,btohqsg
Like my car is categorized as luxury sedan and I see no connection to it,btohqsg
Like golf R-line  i30 N line  318i M Sport,btohqsg
actually  can i suggest a change?,btohqsg
instead of lumping as performance car,btohqsg
but xmm won't relate these cars as sports car. they will think it just a cheap car trying to be sports car,btohqsg
performance is variable from brand to brand,btohqsg
But what about non performance coupes?,btohqsg
Sigh.. that's why... scirocco 1.4 > M3,btohqsg
What if I want a performance coupe sports car?,btohqsg
if u want a specific car  that are more options to choose,btohqsg
thats where u can use metrics like transmission type  engine size  hp,btohqsg
scirocco is ghost of 40 tiang😹😹,btohqsg
screenshot from some random rocco owner😂😂😂,btohqsg
Ya once your xmm pregnant with your child  can upgrade to golf (gti),btohqsg
I really some 1 like this,btohqsg
SG many Motorcross height hump hahahaha. So need SUV 😂,btohqsg
