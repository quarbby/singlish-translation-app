Hike 0.75%. Don't think Powell will hike 1% after 2 consecutive 0.75% hike. More important is the text they release with the rate hike.,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 20 Sept 2022🎉✏️The Treasury market is roaring🗽We are seeing a dramatic rise in the 10-year US Treasury yield for the past month on the backdrop of the uncertainty revolving around the aggressiveness of the Fed in pushing short-term interest rates.Traders signal that the Fed will be in a hawkish mood. After all  in the history of inflation  the Fed is rarely in the relief mode. During the early trading session  we saw the 10-year yield rising to 3.58%  hitting a high note since April 2011.💸All eyes on FOMC meeting outcome🔭Market participants prepare themselves for the big moment when the Fed announces the rate hike. More importantly  the biggest jackpot lies in what the Fed hints at the Nov meeting. There are two layers of concerns.First  investors are worried about the peak of interest rates. They expect the rate to go perhaps to as high as 5% from the initial low of just above 3%.The next headache lies in the concern that the Fed will keep the elevated rate consistent for longer than expected. That is  the pivot will not happen. This will hit the expensive growth stocks such as the Nasdaq index much more than a more diversified index  the S&P 500.It could ripple into the financial market and the constant tightening leading to a recession. If that holds  economically sensitive stocks such as the Dow will start to break loose  more so than companies in the Nasdaq. This is precisely what unfolds on Tuesday. While the Nasdaq tumbled 1.1%  the fall was more severe for the Dow.Indeed  the Dow is reaching a critical junction  30 000 mark.🎯What’s on the menu today?🔦At 10 pm  we will receive the Existing Home Sales figure  which is likely to moderate to 4.81M from 4.70M.Crude Oil Inventories data will also be announced at 10.30 pm  which we expect to remain reasonably stable at 2.16M.The FOMC economic projections and interest rate decision will arrive at 2 am. This is followed by the FOMC press conference  where Uncle Powell will need to communicate the possible path ahead clearly. It is likely to reinforce the statement that the Fed will remain data-dependent.It is 21 Sept  Wednesday  at 9.05 am in Singapore and 9.05 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a splendid and exciting trading day ahead.,btohqsg
