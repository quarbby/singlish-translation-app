UOB one for household expense. Citi rewards amaze for shopping  dinning and other online transactions. UOB Lady for travel related. I choose travel category,btohqsg
Undestood. Lady will be my primary card to spend and clock the min $500 uob one requirement and also to gain miles. Start slow first since i not in urgent need of miles yet haha. And i dun frequent travel  prob 2-3 times per year,btohqsg
Just take note UOB lady card has 1k limit for applying the bonus. But you probably won’t exceed at this stage based on your spending pattern. When you start shopping  eating outside more etc  then you can consider Citi rewards,btohqsg
Hi  fortrip.comdo you use any promo codes when booking? Bank codes or others  if used still can get shopback cashback?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGHi Chris. I still do not know how does your ocbc360 excel works. Can u help me by showing me your youtube link again on the explanation on how to use the excel? Thank you very much,btohqsg
U can set up credit card recurring bill using app. Just rem to choose telco cat for fnf.https://www.singtel.com/personal/support/billing/bill-payment-methods,btohqsg
For travel and miles gathering Dbs woman's world card with 1.5k cap probably a better replacement for uob lady's card with 1k cap?,btohqsg
My view is DBS world card have a shorter expiry period. So if you going for travel once in a while  it may be hassle to manage it.,btohqsg
Friends  I need your expert opinion...a popular sg youtuber floated this idea of paying citi uob credit cards with a single dbs credit card like live fresh so the cash sits in for an additional month.. essentially paying one credit card with another credit card.My understanding is the bank will charge an additional charge if you do this  as it should take it as a form of cash advance.Anyone has done this before or has any idea if this works without any additional payment?,btohqsg
no additional charge if use 'pay bill',btohqsg
So this option in dbs digibank right?,btohqsg
Hi everyone. For citibank rewards card if I pair it with amaze for transactions. Can still get the 40000 points bonus?,btohqsg
Cuz i dont see it reflected yet although I spent more than 800sgd alr.,btohqsg
not sure what 40000 points bonus. Amaze+citi rewards still get 9x bonus so long mcc is not excluded,btohqsg
If you are talking about sign up bonus  it won’t come in so soon. Check tncs to see when it will be credited.,btohqsg
Yes was referring to signup bonus,btohqsg
Can only choose to use one.Either promo codes or earn shopback cashback.,btohqsg
Will do in future cash video,btohqsg

Hello I have a question - let's say when I turn 55 and still working  but my SA already hit ERS... Will my SA exceed the ERS limit from salary contribution?,btohqsg
Continue to be in SA before 55. Above 55  SA up to FRS will transfer to RA  the rest will go to OA.,btohqsg
Yes  by luck. The $888 cashback got credited to moomoo balance next day then I can withdrew it to bank account immediately.I just tested selling all dbs shares. In total there are fees of $4.76  to buy moomoo shares and another fees of $4.80 to sell shares. Total $9.56 to pay moomoo,btohqsg
I thought the SA account will be closed upon 55?,btohqsg
Ok so after 55 yr old  we will have OA  RA and MA right? So if I am still working  will part of my salary still go into RA? Even if my RA already achieved ERS?,btohqsg
For this  need to wait for actual data points during next CPF contribution. Though I would assume the excess flows to OA  just like the SA closure process,btohqsg
Amounts after FRS  will go to OA.,btohqsg
I'm talking abt after 55 yr old..if money goes to OA after FRS is reached  then there is no way we can reach ERS leh,btohqsg
You can still voluntarily contribute to your RA account,btohqsg
I see...meaning we can never exceed ERS? Cos right now before 55 yr old  we can exceed our FRS in SA as a result of salary contribution..so I'm wondering whether is the same for RA after reaching ERS,btohqsg
You can always transfer OA to SA.,btohqsg
Even after our RA reaches ERS?,btohqsg
Good for you  a few friends I send the angpow  all got <100 points or maybe $5 stock voucher only haha,btohqsg
Even after our RA reaches ERS?,btohqsg
Think ERS is the max. Btw  why leave so much in RA,btohqsg
This is just a hypothetical question... for better understanding,btohqsg
Possible if your RA interest is above following year's ERS increment.,btohqsg
Really? Is this a fact or is this a guess? Haha. I tot the excess will flow to the OA?,btohqsg
Theoretical based on CPF's policy.MA excess will flow to OA if RA/SA already FRS.,btohqsg
Thanks for trying to answer my question bro Melvyn...but U are confusing me more... sometimes U talk abt SA  sometimes U talk abt RA...do U know what I am asking actually? Haha,btohqsg
At 55  SA is closed with RA formed with FRS amount. login to CPF and transfer excess OA to RA to reach ERS.,btohqsg
Yes understand this part. So assuming I transfer excess OA to RA to reach ERS  and I am still working  will my RA exceed ERS since my salary is still credited every month? Cos right now our SA can exceed FRS due to salary credit. I'm just wondering whether this is the same for RA after we achieved ERS.,btohqsg
Edited. RA/SA rule is the same when it comes to MA excess flow. Only way to contribute to RA is by OA to RA transfer (below ERS)  mandatory CPF contributions (below FRS) and RA interest.,btohqsg
Yes if not a trader  then the $5 stock voucher is useless as not enough to cover moomoo fees.I asked moomoo staff and their reply'Fees for Singapore Stocks  ETFs  REITs1. Commission: 0.03% * Transaction amount  min 0.99 SGD/ Order;2. Platform Fee: 0.03% * Transaction amount  min 0.99 SGD/ Order;In addition  SGX will also charge Trading Fees and Clearing fees for orders. There's also a 9% GST (consumption tax) to pay.,btohqsg
So in short are u trying to say we will never exceed ERS thru mandatory cpf contribution (via salary) for RA? Even though we may exceed FRS thru mandatory cpf contribution (via salary) for SA? Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
I think once you reach RA frs limit  all monthly contributions from your salary will go towards OA only.(provided your MA also reaches BHS).You can voluntarily transfer your OA to RA till ERS,btohqsg
I applied my CRMC on end of October and spend total $800 by middle of November and the bonus come in early December last year,btohqsg
Who can confirm my question ah? Chris able to confirm? Or can do a video on this haha,btohqsg
Only those with ERS + 55 & above + Employed will confirm  we should see more datapoints in next few weeks,btohqsg
Moomoo fees are much better than alot of local brokerages who charge $25++ exclu the SGX fees and GST.For a $10k trade on Moomoo  buy/sell usually incur approx $10 total in fees. Compared to maybe $30+ for brokerages,btohqsg
Also if you're not near 55 yet  no point to speculate what will happen since it is beyond control. Focus on gaining more income/income sources is more important than allocation of CPF,btohqsg
Hello UOB experts  can I ask by when should I make transaction to hit $500 spendings  since next week Wed and Thurs is CNY.,btohqsg
Thanks Chris  Melvyn  Joanne and Jeremy for answering my question. Yup will wait and see...just curious and trying to understand cpf better. Thanks,btohqsg
Anyone manage to waive UOB Absolute annual fee? Mine was due recently and i tried to waive it via the app but was unsuccessful. Have called in to ask and they say they will send an appeal for me,btohqsg
Do you know what is the maximum amount we can tribute to SA via salary per year?,btohqsg
Will Tomorrow Friday transactions still enough time to reflect within January?,btohqsg

Hello all! Need some advice as it’s my first credit card.. i have a UOB one and have been paying promptly but last month was a bit tight on cash so i didn’t pay the full amount..my understanding is that as long as the bare minimum is paid before the due date there should be no charge or interest.however this month’s statement there a line of “INTERESTS” that i have to pay. Is this correct?,btohqsg
solitaire card you get $2k limit,btohqsg
U pay minimum u won’t kenna late fee but u pay 28% pa interest on the unpaid balance,btohqsg
If i clear this cycle there is no additional charge right?,btohqsg
continue incur interest till full payment is made,btohqsg
Advice u to overpay to cover one month extra interest. What u see on statement isn’t what u currently owe in total. Due to accrued interest and lag time,btohqsg
Just FYI.Paying minimum avoids you being charged late fees. But you are still charged interest on the unpaid balance. Please don't let the interest accumulate — credit card interest really high,btohqsg
No matter how tight the cash  always pay in full. Budget your spending with whatever is remaining.Reminder that interest accrues daily. Best to pay the card off immediately.,btohqsg
you should pay the full amount that is due now  then apply for interest waiver. don't accumulate credit card interest  rate very high,btohqsg
Can apply for interest waiver? Do i call uob?,btohqsg
iirc  the app should be able to (automatic decision). but pls pls pay the full balance,btohqsg
if the request is rejected  then maybe you need to speak to uob cso to request,btohqsg

Lets say sofi dosent go above 20 next friday and the option expires out of the money which means its not exercisesWill i get the negative balance and will it affect my overall portfolio balance ?,btohqsg

My understanding the 28% is not based on the unpaid amount but calculate using the transaction amount from the date of transaction  not statement date or due date. Is it correct?,btohqsg
What if the interest has already been credited?,btohqsg
Hello! For the 3 trades for $2000 NVDA tier  is there a minimum sum per trade? Thanks!,btohqsg

no it is based on the Unpaid rolled over outstanding.e.g. Total Transactions was $1000. Minimum due is $100  you paid $200.No late feeYou incur 28% p.a. interest on $800. WHEN the 28% p.a. interest honestly I don't know since I don't do such.. ermm... unoptimal things.It could either be 28% p.a. interest from transaction date or from Due date. i am not sure.,btohqsg
It can be seem in uob tmrw under my reward tab where it show the point breakdown,btohqsg
interest start incurring after due date,btohqsg

Realise IRAS only allow eGIRO application for income tax payment now  subject to exceptions. As HSBC is one of the listed banks for eGIRO  it means we have no choice but to apply via eGIRO if we want to pay via HSBC EGA.  For those who applied via eGIRO recently  able to share any data point if GIRO income tax payment via initial eGIRO application still earns the 1% bonus cashback? I would think so since eGIRO is just an electronic form of application but underlying deduction is via the same GIRO network? Thanks in advance.,btohqsg

Not reallyYou incur interest for $1000 from each and every transaction dateThen lowered to the $800 till you settle the $800.You also need to consider new transactions from new statement.If you pay the $800 plus the previous month interest charge. Then no further interest will be charged.This is  assuming your transaction is not cash advance.,btohqsg

Sorry  I think simplygo cannot  misunderstood thought the question was can we simply go and use the credit card and get 1.7% without other criteria 🙏 sorry. SPACE matters 😂,btohqsg
Oh ok so 1.7% is for everything else but simply Go cant yea. Thanks for clarification.,btohqsg
And thanks for sharing this too. !,btohqsg

Sorry if anyone asked before but can i just ask  how does uob ladys card work with simplygo? If i select the transport cat  since it is $5 block and most of the rides will be <$5  can i just assume i wont get the 1x UOB$ but just the 9x UOB$ at the end of the month,btohqsg
Yes. You can still get 1x for some as it's how Mastercard works.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/245917,btohqsg
You must continuously use as SimplyGo for MasterCard accumulates before posting.,btohqsg
Visa one is wrong  transactions accumulate daily  and post few business days after.,btohqsg
Its specific to uob visa. Its posted every day but accumulated once a month for bonus.,btohqsg

Don't have to. Just put the purpose.,btohqsg
Don't use FAST or PayNow and it should be OK.Remarks doesn't matter.,btohqsg
Oh  so FAST is OK for UOB?,btohqsg
Maybe I was confused with other banks to dbs. I remembered FAST doesn't work for either one.,btohqsg
So this only works with DBS / OCBC?,btohqsg
Basically you can use any banks which allows you to choose the purpose.I tried with Maybank and it worked too.,btohqsg
Tried doing so with Citi  not working,btohqsg
Maybe I shall try with DBS / POSB later. OCBC don't seem to have Salary as a purpose of transfer,btohqsg
Lol. You need to wait at least one day. Just be patient.,btohqsg
Oh LOL  opps. I saw Dy did it  I thought it was almost instantaneous hahahah,btohqsg
It says as of 24 Jan... Ur salary credit is dated 25 Jan... Wait for it to update bah.,btohqsg

Hi All  Just curious  need to spend more than 2K on jewels  thinking of using HSBC advance cc (2.5% CB). Does the HSBC rewards program provides additional 1% CB ? And I have the below card1. DBS YUU (0.5%)2. UOB AB AMEX (1.7%)3. HSBC rev (not sure )4. Citi cashback +(1.6%)5. Maybank Barcelona (1.6%). I guess from the above list HSBC adv is higher of 2.5%. Pls help. TIA,btohqsg
yes 2.5% no more additional 1% from everyday+ rewards,btohqsg
Can consider new bank sign up. And also split the payment using other 4mpd cards even as cash rebate is higher than your existing deck.,btohqsg
When I click on the link  no T&C. If not I wouldn't be asking here. The pinned message just said new to card customers. So does it apply to debit as well?,btohqsg
New to credit card so you are ok,btohqsg
If you are referring to the pinned message  the tnc won’t be there. You have to click the link for each card to go to singsaver site. The tnc is at there.,btohqsg

I never said cannot use. No rewards thou.,btohqsg
Will the transaction qualify for qualifying spend for new cc ?,btohqsg
Thx. Just to check   does Citi rewards master card helps here? Sorry I’m a cashback person. If I convert the points to Cash  is it approx 2.27% and if I got chance to add HSBC EGA GIRO  then 1% ? Is my understanding correct ?,btohqsg
Your understanding is correct but why use Citi rewards instead of dedicated cashback card,btohqsg
It up to you to decide which cards u want but I mentioned crmc of cos plus amaze is so that if 1 day u changed your mind to miles then you are already there with your points.,btohqsg
Citi rewards with amaze is the first card that recommend to get for flexibility for points or miles to convert. Hopefully as long Citi don’t exclude amaze,btohqsg

Based on my CB card the max CB is 2.7% UOB AB AMEX(1.7% +1%HSBC EGA GIRO) but with this CRMC it seems I can get 3.27%(2.27% from CRMC +1% HSBC EGA GIRO). Pls correct me if anything is wrong. Thx,btohqsg
Citi is capped at 1k spend. The amex is uncapped.,btohqsg

Hi all the experts here. Wanted to know how to kickstart the UOB lady solitaire card? Just got it. I choose travel and family.Am planning to book travel stuffs  wondering where to check if the online platform such as Agoda &trip.comqualifies? Or just book direct with hotel & airlines?Am currently using UOB KF.,btohqsg
I would start off with risk vs benefit... How much is your loan and how much can you get from the fund? What's the price volatility? Then ask yourself if your risk appitite is OK for that amount of potential profit?For example  if using promotional balance transfer of 6mth  it only costs me 2.1% and if I can put into a high yield saving account to earn 4.1%  potential profit is 2% and risk is minimal since no forex risk  and no investment involve...,btohqsg

Hi guys does anyone know for ocbc 360 salary credit can we use our own interbank transfer as salary?,btohqsg
Hi experts  I'm new to the credit card game and to the working world  is it advisable to sign up credit cards just to get sign up rewards and not use the card ever again and cancel it before they charge annual fees. I've read that it affects credit scores and etc and it is not worth if the sign up rewards isn't super massive. Thoughts and advice for this please thank you.,btohqsg
You could sign up from the same bank  eg. UOB Privi for SUB first before PPV  Ladys  VS. Hold all until annual fee cannot be waived. Keep a few months between applying cards from different banks.,btohqsg
Because it was supposed to charge u usd10 fee I guess.,btohqsg
My personal opinion is signing up for cc only you want to use it and can make use of the features/rewards,btohqsg

I tried that for 2 months  it didn’t work and the return without the salary credit component is too low. So closed my account after 6 months,btohqsg

Does anyone know if private dental clinics (eg Q&M) is usually in credit card exclusion list?,btohqsg
usually not excluded. Uob absolute amex is one of the rare ones that exclude.,btohqsg
Thank you  happy new year to you too.I'm holding some STI ETF for now. I also have a very small amount of money in syfe for S&P500. For the short term high yield savings account you mentioned  is that with the bank?,btohqsg
The one I go to earns on Amaze+CRMC.,btohqsg
Actually we all want to learn from you how do achieve $380k saving at the age of 25 without diploma and no stable income. 😄.,btohqsg
If you already trade to 300k networth. Why you seek advice? You shld already know what to do yourself. Just trust your heart  continue what you doing.,btohqsg
I didnt make the full 300k from trading  i only made about 20k so far. Also friends have been saying timing the market is not a good way to trade. I need a more sustainable and long term approach.,btohqsg
70k is inheritance  saved up about 130k from working etc. And bulk of the rest is from 🎰💀,btohqsg
90% of the part time jobs i've worked is cash only no cpf also.,btohqsg
Oic. First thing you need to do is to preserve your saving. Look for stable investment/saving  such as high interest bank saving accounts(4%-4.65%. Req $500 spend on CC monthly and salary credit) n SG government bond eg. Tbill 3%. Look for a stable job that has CPF contributions.  Then consider only park small portion in trading.,btohqsg
So i'll probably need a full time job first since i can't get a CC without proper income then. I did put $100k in SSB previously but i feel the interest too less for 10 year period,btohqsg
See yourself lor. I will say don't need to seek advice from people. People advice can be wrong too. Just use it as a reference.It is your life. You decide yourself. Test out more things on what you suitable and like for.,btohqsg
The best non investment advice I can provide is to always apply for HDB BTO as early and as soon as you can.For investment advice it is probably not appropriate to give any in a public forum other than say everyone has different risk profile and investment needs. Seek a licenced professional advice but beware of hefty commissions. Many of us are doing own self directed cheap investments but you must know what u are doing.,btohqsg
Understood thank you  cant bto if i'm single tho 🥲 I've been doing everything myself because i don't wanna pay the comms also,btohqsg
Second non investment advice (in my humble opinion)  a great complimentary life partner is the other best “asset” you can have to each other.,btohqsg
This one q tough  still working on it. Not that i'm picky but most i've dated are too materialistic or not driven enough in life. Also don't match my life goals,btohqsg
Hi guys  need advise. Booking hotel via Agoda have an option to pay now or pay at later date. If we choose to pay at later date  does that consider clocking as Jan or March spending in this case?,btohqsg
A general investment technique which u are probably familiar with and many of us do is Dollar Cost Averaging.Pick an asset you like and have researched about  then buy a fixed amount of it every month without bothering about price movements.,btohqsg
I'm currently doing that for Syfe  not trading individual stock for US market because i don't know enough or volatility is too much for me. V slow so far because i only got about $2k in syfe,btohqsg
Counts towards the month when the transaction is charged.,btohqsg
Hi All  just to get confirmed  is Maybank Barcelona card gives treats points only for foreign currency spend? And the local payment will have 1.6% cashback? Also does the local spend for 1.6% is it necessary to be block of $5?,btohqsg
Take note the difference in the amount can be quite substantial from the price you see now. Read agoda’s T&C,btohqsg
That will be 4.90% interest per year?,btohqsg
4% plus (cash bonus / 150 000) / 2Since I treat it as 6 month lock in. This is a conservative calculation.,btohqsg
Don’t you have to move the money out everytime for a month if u want to do this cash bonus ? It’s “fresh fund” right? So lose 1 month of 4% and there isn’t anything around this rate now. Highest is 3.2% cimb?,btohqsg
Is $520 sufficient to cover 1st Jan PH   today & tmr too?,btohqsg

Similar to Krisflyer waitlist but for EVA you need to pay taxes first.,btohqsg
Do they refund you the taxes if waitlist didn’t go through?,btohqsg
From what I read online:‘You're issued a ticket for the waitlist  points deducted  taxes paid.If you cancel / refund before the flight (whether or not waitlist is confirmed)  you need to pay $50 refund fee for the points and taxes refund.If you don't cancel (even if you are NOT confirmed a seat by departure)  you can use the ticket for up to a year from booking  but it has to be the same departure/destination.’My advice is do not put yourself on the waitlist.,btohqsg

Hi 👋.  Found this group from YouTube. If it's not too much trouble I have a question 1) I am a Singaporean living overseas2) I still have some bills in Singapore. Was thinking to apply for a credit card but am obviously not eligible as I don't have income in Singapore3) I will go the 10k fixed deposit route. I found 3 banks that offer thisHsbc dbs and uobDo you guys recommend any credit cards for the above banks? I am mostly overseas and still have some bills in SingaporeThank you again,btohqsg
got try apply card and got rejected?,btohqsg
I gave a call to DBS and they said they can't approve as I have no CPF contribution history,btohqsg
I was thinking a travel card. I.e HSBC T1 or DBS altitude. Since I am overseas  I can earn more MPD on spends here on top of bills in Singapore.,btohqsg
Where do you live actually? Their banks may have better offers for the locals.,btohqsg
Qatar. I have full bank services here but I am at the mercy of fluctuating exchange rates when I pay bills in Singapore. On top of that  the card doesn't work for some services in Singapore.1) was thinking to consolidate all sg bills to one card. And just pay the card monthly,btohqsg
Depends on your bill types. Some are excluded from earning rewards,btohqsg
I saw that too. Like most don't allow insurance premium,btohqsg
I emailed them today to complain about the Expedia being unavailable and they finally acknowledged my 14.5% cashback discrepancy in December. They will topup my missing cashback from 12.5% to 14.5%. I had 5 bookings affected.They also acknowledged an issue with the Expedia cashback on 16th January.All those who did Expedia at 14.5% on 12th December  suggest you double check your cashback tracked amount.It should be Hotel Amount (tax excluded) x 14.5% if u booked between 12-2am on 12th December 2024.,btohqsg
Any recommendations CC for Harvey Norman physical store. $5000.Looking for 4 miles per dollar or at least 3% cashback.,btohqsg
4 mpds got cap  unless they agree to split the payment.Your best bet is Kris+ and UOB KF (3 mpd on full amount).,btohqsg
Then your choice is limited. As different card for different bills to optimised cashback. I guess you better just continue paying direct. Not worth the effort and money tied to secured cc.,btohqsg
O this is also good! Thanks thanks,btohqsg

Hi gurus not sure if my method of calculation is correct. If ocbc website shows my current mab is 100k and it is 1000 increase as compared to the last month and my balance in the account is only 98k now. If I were to keep the sum. Intact  my MAB would be like 100k and I assume I need to transfer like 12500 on 1st Feb to hit the 500 increase? My question would be:1) Should I transfer out like 70 or 75k tomorrow to reduce my MAB as I am trying to reset my 360 account; or2) my calculation is wrong and it is safe to keep the 98k still inside my account.Thank you gurus for the help.,btohqsg
Don't really get what you're typing... But this is what I'm interpreting:Dec MAB: $99000Current MAB for Jan: $100000Current increment MAB: $1000If you want to be as close to $500 increment MAB ($99500)  you need to have at least $84500 in your account at the end of tomorrow  or $90000 if you want to be safe  includes buffer for any inaccuracies in your original message.If you keep your MAB at $100000  then you will need $100500 to be in the account from 1 Feb onwards.,btohqsg
Yes I wanted to achieve as close as possible to 500 mab so that my Feb mab can be lower. Thank you guru.,btohqsg
Best to calculate yourself and not rely on my calculation,btohqsg

Does HSBC EGA giro still give 1% cashback for payment to other bank credit card? I read somewhere that it has discontinued ?,btohqsg
Hmm… yes meaning the 1% still applies?,btohqsg
Yes. And you should find other more reliable sources for information.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check if anyone knows - for DBS wwmc the 1.5k cap/mth for bonus point  is it based on calendar mth?,btohqsg
based on transaction date (of the merchant) within calendar month,btohqsg
Because it show this in heymax.😂,btohqsg
Link it for tracking mcc and other heymax promo for visa cards.Trust link points can be managed in trust app anyway.,btohqsg
Hi all  what’s the recommended savings account for a fresh grad?,btohqsg
Anyone have any opinions on downgrading integrated shield plan from private to just restructured hospitals. The idea behind this is that i’m also getting older and premiums are getting higher. Weighing the pros and cons beside cost cutting. Anyone has also gone thru the stage to either upgrade or downgrade the plan?,btohqsg
This is the only visa card i had  was planning to participate in heymax promotion for the miles for transportation campaign. Will see if it works with this card next week. 😮‍💨,btohqsg
For transportation promo w heymax  it should work.,btohqsg
Check UOB one and ocbc 360. HSBC ega is for a bit more advance.,btohqsg
UOB one useful only if the fresh grad has $150k of funds lying around,btohqsg
Those 2 accounts are straight forward. Fell free to suggest too.,btohqsg
3% p.a. for the lowest tier is still pretty decent.,btohqsg
dbs multiplier has pretty low interest (below 3%) without insurance/invest/home loan.,btohqsg
No la don’t say only if… I feel it’s good to encourage to even start small and slowly build up. In life we don’t always have to maximize from beginning..the process to get there is equally important as long as we start on it…,btohqsg
Anyone who participated in the Dec 2024 UOB earmark savings? Have your funds been earmarked yet?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  I recently cleared my debt consolidation plan with DBS in Dec'2024 and am looking at personal loan for minor reno & refurbishing (been staying in current BTO for 10yrs now) and other misc expenses. Am thinking of applying loan for before completing my notice period next month  so I have cash to tide me through till I secure my next job. Want to confirm if:1) I should only look at EIR when applying loan?2) is the EIR fixed and applicable throughout the loan tenure?3) Would it be more advisable to take credit card instalments for big ticket items such as aircon  fridge  travel etc?4) I was not able to apply for any loans before and realised it was because of the debt consolidation plan  would it affect my application still?,btohqsg
1) yes2) yes3) yes   provided it’s 0% installment and u pay your bills on time each month,btohqsg
ah.. ok would it be advisable if I apply for credit card now and get installments for the big ticket items  then I use the loan to cover the payments for the time being? What are the pros and cons to that?,btohqsg
When do we expect the next uob one earmark promo? Is it Apr for Mar 2025 MAB?,btohqsg
Is the trust cashback credit card hard to apply? I dunno why I was rejected. I requested for the CB report  and my repayment record is all As  because I pay everything by giro. I applied for Citibank premier mile card on the same day and it was approved,btohqsg
Apr. So keep ur march MAB as low as possible.,btohqsg
Noted  let me put in the calendar for $1000,btohqsg
Hi All  can I clarify for HSBC EGA do I get the bonus interest for 2 months or I need to switch to my player 2 account every month?,btohqsg
When will the giro be deducted from my ega account? My credit card due date is today 31jan.,btohqsg
Bank says 3 days prior to due date until now haven deduct.. maybe cos of public holiday? If today nvr deduct siao liao,btohqsg
Likely because you applied another card recently(in this fact  same day),btohqsg
Every month if you want the 1% from Everyday+ Rewards,btohqsg
If your payment had been via GIRO previously then it should not be a problem to get your bank to waive any late charges/ interest fees,btohqsg
I got the problem previously and Citibank waived off the fees 😉,btohqsg
When did you set up? Does your statement specifically state GIRO payment?,btohqsg
which bank? dun think any need 3 days prior. They just being KS and want to make sure u have enough funds during actual giro deduction.,btohqsg
Hi guys. I am reaching my 55 soon and I have already set aside my FRS.Qns: Isit good to take all my remaining amount to invest in dividend stock like DBS   Mapletree industry?,btohqsg
Let say I have like 400k to dump in DBS to collect dividends yield every year,btohqsg
Hi Gurus. For HSBC EGA account  the interest is credited monthly or daily? Thank you.,btohqsg
monthly based on incremental monthly average balance,btohqsg
Depends on your own risk tolerance and assessment. No one can give appropriate financial advice for this. Best to seek your financial advisor for the way forward.,btohqsg
Do I need to keep my funds till the last day of the month to earn the month's interest? What will happen if I withdraw all the funds before the month end?,btohqsg

Just curious on this and I want to make sure I understand this correctly  once we reach 55 yo  we can withdraw the full amount from OA  provided if our SA has more than FRS? Any amount in SA that is above FRS is not withdrawable right?,btohqsg
You will not have SA after 55 years old. Anything exceed FRS will go to OA.,btohqsg
But can withdraw anytime right? The amount above FRS,btohqsg
Check your retirement dashboard at 55 how much you can withdraw. It is in the FAQ,btohqsg
Not yet 55  just asking in advanced,btohqsg
You can withdraw at 55 after forming your FRS.,btohqsg
Ok 👌🏻 basically it functions like a high-yield savings account (for any amount above FRS),btohqsg
For a 2.5% that is comparable to FD  you can keep it and withdraw when needed.,btohqsg
Anything in OA can be withdrawn.,btohqsg
Anybody receive UOB Evol cashback for December transaction today?,btohqsg
It comes with the statement. Yesterday was PH  so no statement was generated over night.,btohqsg
Why would that matter ? Actually I applied trust cashback card first  and Citibank premier miles cards a few days later,btohqsg
The tracker usually stays put until 1st working day of new month right  so maybe Mon 3 Feb will see all posted (hopefully). Then Tue 4 Feb will start from zero after bonus interest for Jan is given out. Hopefully it is like that....,btohqsg
For HSBC Giro cashback on income tax payment  is there another condition to fulfill besides the giro arrangement  such as minimum spending on the credit card? I didn't seem to receive the cashback,btohqsg
Trust is automated  I guess it rejects based on credit score without human interaction.,btohqsg
System might flag you as desperate credit borrower  leading to rejection.When was the last card you applied before Trust cashback card?,btohqsg
Assuming you already done $2k in and 5 transactions out  when was the GIRO payment done?,btohqsg
It's for UOB VS haha. If it goes to next month statement  I need to hit 1k spend again on fcy  which is hard when not traveling.,btohqsg
transfer 2k/5k in and 5 transactions,btohqsg
"What do you mean by ""done 2K""  and ""5 transactions out"" meaning spending the CC for 5 times or transfer/giro 5 transaction per month?",btohqsg
I think you need to read how to qualify for HSBC Ega Rewards+,btohqsg
Hi can someone verify for meI'm using Citi Rewards + Instagram Amazd combo for 10X points / 4mpdI'm using a Samsung Phone. If I use Google Pay to pay using Amaze card that's linked to Citi RewardWill it still qualify for bonus or be excluded?,btohqsg
yes so long mcc is not excluded from 10x points,btohqsg
On Citi Rewards T&C says it excludes mobile wallet paymentSo I want to understand how Amaze + Google Pay will workThank you,btohqsg
I see. I do transfer 2K in monthly,btohqsg
It's online payment method through Amaze.,btohqsg
amaze is online not mobile wallet payment,btohqsg
Okay 👍🏻 thank you. So no need for physical card at all in this caseThank you@MelvynEziTrazora,btohqsg
I overlooked on the 5 transactions! Thanks,btohqsg

Dropped 0.1% compared for all tiers except Premier Elite 0.02%,btohqsg
Seems like got typo? Only accounts opened before 1 Jan eligible. Worse than Jan's promo where new accounts not eligible.,btohqsg
maybe separate promo for newly opened EGA accounts?,btohqsg
Hi. So the reference mth Is Jan 2025.So if Jan we have 10 kFeb is 100kMar is 100k.Both mth Feb and Mar will have 90K incremental and entitled to the bonus Interest?,btohqsg
Feb 3.7% p.a.  Mar 2.7% p.a.  Apr 0.05% p.a.This includes 1% bonus interest from Everyday+ Rewards.,btohqsg
If they already registered in Dec  they cannot register in Jan and can only register in Feb.,btohqsg
the TNCs recently very very confusing to be honest,btohqsg
They adding a lot of stupid clauses,btohqsg
1. registered when cannot qualify when2. single single/joint3. reference months4. qualifying monthsvery dangerous to advise people since the tnc may not be consistent across months,btohqsg
Because you don't have incremental funds in Mar  as stated in your original message.,btohqsg
But if never register in Dec either. Then register today is better right?  I just smsed today,btohqsg
Cos I thought both Feb and Mar balances with be referenced back to Jan. So if it is not.  Then just keep for 1 mth Feb. to get 3.7 %,btohqsg

3.7% really ain't that great anymore with UOB One offering fuss free at 4%,btohqsg
Hmmm... UOB need to MS with $500 spend.Also need human and extra credit card. (Lady / One),btohqsg
this one i find unbelievable..how can anyone not be able to hit $500 spending on the eligible cards with UOB,btohqsg
Everyone seems to hit $500.00 easily or $2000.00 😂,btohqsg
Not everyone able to spend solely on card ma. Especially hawker meal doesn't accept card,btohqsg
Uob one cc and put sp on it should be half way of 500$ already,btohqsg
i found the perfect sweet spot to make it a real 10% specific merchants card liao..$1400 specific merchants$600 SP Poweri think with this combi.. nobody is going to argue with me that it isn't a real 10% cashback card anymore,btohqsg
Overspend in access of 2k not best optimized leh..,btohqsg
Oh your SP utilities is high  ok makes sense 👍🏼,btohqsg
You really spent a lot. Got so many card all can fulfill the minimum spent?,btohqsg
UOB Credit and Debit Cards that are eligible to earn bonus interest on the UOB One Account includeUOB One Card  UOB Lady's Card (all card types)  UOB EVOL Card  Lazada-UOB Card  UOB One Debit Visa Card  UOB One Debit Mastercard  UOB Lady's Debit Card and UOB Mighty FX Debit Card.,btohqsg
long long time ago in a galaxy far away.. people used to mock me for saying UOB One is a 10% cashback card because they say it is a 8.3% cashback card.. $500 / $6000 = 8.33% cashback.but my point is the non specific merchants are non discretionary spend in the first place.. and if i fill it up with $600 SP Power (which nobody else in the market can give 4.3% cashback).. isn't the $1400 spend at say shopee PURE 10% cashback?,btohqsg
Are you on OEM elect provider? SembCorp / Tuas so that it links to SP bill?,btohqsg
