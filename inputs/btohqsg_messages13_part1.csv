Hello! Are there any overseas students here that applied for BTO? What do we have to prepare to show to HDB to prove that we are students?,btohqsg
proof of enrolment may suffice! u might want to call hdb to ask. i have yet to do so too,btohqsg
"Hey thanks! I was thinking what to show because the uni requires us to pay for the ""letter""",btohqsg
oh man maybe try calling hdb to ask!! maybe a proof that you accepted the offer or something that shows you are currently studying there would be enough  can try your luck asking,btohqsg
Concerned if Yishun area is heavily populated with birds. ?,btohqsg
The current Feb 2022 Yishun bto seems quite nice  but right beside a bunch of forest trees. Wonder if many birds will cause a noise problem there,btohqsg
Nowadays you donâ€™t need to be neat forest to get birds calling in the morning   especially koels,btohqsg
In bedok its evening one particular tree only 7pm alot of birds for 1 hour. When I see forest I wonder what is the situation like,btohqsg
Theres a video on the feb 22 launch?,btohqsg
Some people go and review the place and the surrounding,btohqsg
Bird still ok  most likely u will hear gun shots at night,btohqsg
Me  i stay there nearby actually lol,btohqsg
No birds around so much forestry.. amazing.. looks is quite peaceful.  Gunshots ?,btohqsg
Not v often la but have.,btohqsg
That area generally quite peaceful but the morning and night traffic can be quite noisy if ur living facing that area,btohqsg
Traffick from small road or expressway m,btohqsg
What y'all think. Good spot or bad spot,btohqsg
I just want a serene quiet place,btohqsg
That place is quiet but do note that traffic is very bad due to the fact that the only way in or out is via yishun dam,btohqsg
Traffic when we are going to work ?,btohqsg
I would call it mini expressway,btohqsg
From the looks of it ah  the nearby only got 2 entrance to the mini expressway which MAY cause potential jam.I am not sure if they will open up 1 more entrance at the new BTO  like how they did with Melody Spring.,btohqsg
I think its bad also  but i personally never travel there yet cos i go by Mandai.,btohqsg
Cos that area links to TPE and CTE. CTE is towards CBD area. Weekend should be rather quiet.I travel there on weekends and its rather quiet.,btohqsg
Good spot  thats why got condo there hahaha. I heard the condo ppl there making noise cos HDB building a EC covering their view of the beautiful forest.,btohqsg

"1st PLH Rochor: ""PLH BTO will offer 3-room units at $409 000 to $474 000  while 4-room units are priced at $582 000 to $688 000.""2nd PLH King George: ""3-room flats in King Georgeâ€™s Heights$353 000 - $462 000 / 4-room flats in King Georgeâ€™s Heights$488 000 - $675 000""",btohqsg
Dakota Cres:3-room flats in Dakota Crest$352 000 - $456 000 / 4-room flats in Dakota Crest$522 000 - $688 000,btohqsg
No brainer to go for Dakota similar price but not PLH (less restrictions),btohqsg
Can be argued similarly for King George  if you are purely looking to stay. Cheaper and potentially higher floor and potentially less competition (due to PLH),btohqsg
Thats true also  plus King George is still 'nearer' to town by proximity afterall,btohqsg
I see application rates then decide ðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
Cfm Feb will eat gao gao empty plate,btohqsg
Any owner of ppvc unit here? Curious to find out to what extend can the walls be hacked,btohqsg
