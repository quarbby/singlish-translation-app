Hi guys! Recently  I have contemplated applying for an Amex Credit Card  specifically TCB  yet I find myself intrigued by the allure of their Personal Charge Card  specifically the Green variant. However  I am left to ponder the practicality of owning an Amex Charge Card. Is it a wise decision?,btohqsg
Not practical at all and still must pay AF. You're just attracted by the look and history.,btohqsg
U can elaborate your spending habit too. If a lot of fine dining then is ok. If it hawker and grab pay topics then no need amex charge la,btohqsg
I understand now  thank you for shedding light on the matter.,btohqsg
The TNC put $800 minimum spending  if never spend $800 after every month after the initial month  is there any fees to pay? Cause I usually just apply the credit card and spend for the first month only haha,btohqsg
Means I can just spend first two months for the $988 then no need use already right,btohqsg
Lazy to change iras giro  so just pay with cc,btohqsg
How to pay? Since axs blocked by gpmc,btohqsg
Hey guys  what's the catch for standard chartered smart credit card? no annual fee and the bonus in site like moneysmart is great,btohqsg

"I'm getting an error ""insufficient buying power"" in webull  I have enough funds  what's the issue?",btohqsg

The system on the bus told me to use another card   anyone faced this same issue before,btohqsg
Just use another card and call SCB for help,btohqsg
hey  has anyone used the Mayback Barcelona CC for education fee payments?,btohqsg
You can charge to your CRMC card directly for taxi/privatehire car rides (grab  go jek). Food delivery also gives 4mpd for CRMC,btohqsg

Hi all. Noob question.Which bank saving got good interest rate nowadays? I am a bit shocked with my dbs multiplier act  since i have only salary credit+credit card usage.. only first 50k got good rate.,btohqsg
Hi  does it matter if I cancel the cc that I have for the longest (5yrs+) if I no longer use it anymore? In term of credit score,btohqsg
don't think it really matters muchhttps://www.creditbureau.com.sg/credit-score.htmlgenerally most important is always paying your credit card bills/loan repayments on timequite different from the american credit score concept,btohqsg
On credit score  is it as important as it seems in Singapore compared to the US? I don't hear much about credit score in SG based youtubers or even the general finance tips,btohqsg
Credit score not really used here,btohqsg
wow Kelvin kor kor is here?!,btohqsg
it is important  but you don't have to build it upits more like a penalty system rather than a reward system,btohqsg
Banks relies more on salary to determine whether lend or not,btohqsg
Kelvin kor kor  we still waiting for your crypto exchange video that you promised months ago leh,btohqsg
Thank You! Wa my first time asking a question andKelvinresponded  hahaha!,btohqsg
Charge whatever you can to DBS WW  and HSBC REVO  if you have DBS altitude card can charge the remaining there (earns 3mpd for hotels and flights - cap of $5k per month for this earn rate),btohqsg
Unless you going for a bank loan  credit score doesn't really make too big a deal here. Even if a credit card gets cancelled  if other cards you have still in use then no problem  credit score will be ok after a few months. But paying your card bills in full on time is important to maintain good credit score  and ensure one doesn't chalk up huge credit card debt.If applying for a HDB loan  so long as you're employed with CPF then all's goodHope this helps,btohqsg
if anyone here is Great Eastern customer  do you know what is Great Dollar and Gift Credit?,btohqsg
Should be 100k in the last update few months ago,btohqsg
If u have 100k  try uob one account. 5% per year. Best in town. Chris has mentioned it many times in his video.,btohqsg
Alas I got the dreaded double charge by Amaze card... What's the experience like to get this resolved?,btohqsg
If don't have 100k  then how about bank share? Dbs UOB or ocbc better ?,btohqsg
My personal observation. Dbs high volumes. Ocbc low volumes but affordable. Uob between ocbc and dbs. Depends what you want.,btohqsg
Trust Bank gives 2.5% for some relatively easy conditions. Can also consider OCBC 360 instead,btohqsg
"I too am on the receiving end of a rather ""low"" interest rate from DBS Multiplier due to credit card spend (1 category) in addition to salary credit. But oh wells  I don't think DBS will be revising up their interest rate too much anytime soon",btohqsg
SIF better. 2.5%. No criteria at all. Trust bank  need some criteria to fullfil.,btohqsg
Yea what Kelvin says sounds right. I applied for a card last year  paid on time every month for 4 months.already 1990+/2000AA rating or smth liao,btohqsg
What card will earn miles if paying hospital visits?,btohqsg
I have CRMC  DBS Alti  HSBC Revolution.,btohqsg
Correct me if I’m wrong  but I thibk Citi doesn’t exclude hospital/specialist/doctors. Should be able to use CRMC/CRMC+Amaze for 4mpd…,btohqsg
Hmm need to spend 500$ for uob credit card to get that interest rate. I will consider it,btohqsg
Maybe will consider ocbc because of low cost also around 4.6 %diviend,btohqsg
Does CRMC rewards 4mpd if use favepay at merchant?,btohqsg
