U are confusing Everyday+ and EGA bonus interest. These are two different programs.,btohqsg
but they will send the sms to confirm eligible for the 1%?,btohqsg
got one month system error.. nobody received..but generally should get the SMS one.. and each SMS lasts for 2 cycles.,btohqsg
This monthâ€™s SMS is in. I did on 1st Jul.HSBCSG (1/2): You've qualified for the HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme! From now until 31AUG2024  enjoy 1% Cashback on eligible debit card spends and,btohqsg
Yea lor becomes average daily balance minus all outflow basically,btohqsg
Not confused they eat up my everyday bouns programme if I want the giro. I do think the two programme now has a offset on the outflow amount,btohqsg
The wording u are using is confusing.,btohqsg
HSBC system is lousy one.Donâ€™t believe they can do it,btohqsg
Yea maybe u can use a better wording.,btohqsg
Just ADB minus off total outflow from account for the 1% bah. Easy to calculate for them. annoying is they only keep changing rules and this only applies to new July promotion in July August period not the others,btohqsg
Is it  the credit limit is shared among banks?,btohqsg
Actually what I worry now is 20th June I have a giro of 20k  the 2nd July I put in 300k. Do I get interest on 280k  or worse case 0$,btohqsg
Basically I try to simply to say I just want to max my 300sgd bouns for hsbc ega (yes I already run it since April at 2 human account) but if I just target this 300sgd bouns  once I have any giro on top I will reduce this amount and then get back in giro 1% rate. To me it's confusing. Yes. I don't have better wording. These 2 programme are on the same account but rules contradict on the outflow. If they really prefer people don't send money out within 30 days  then why ask people to set giro and also run 5 transactions.,btohqsg
It is not so easy because how are they going to prove the $5k in transferred in on 6th July is the same money as the $10k that went out on 5th July.Can kenna law suit or Mas complaint one.,btohqsg
I would recommend just do your normal things. If really kenna interest loss  then stop HSBC EGA Loh.Because all of us now are also guessing.,btohqsg
Oh no need to prove its same money or not. So if it is only saying the fresh funds cannot withdraw within 30day ma  so just deduct all the money ever outflow from the account from the average daily balance ok already,btohqsg
The rule of no withdrawal of 30days not guessing.But the effect indeed it seems is  if u want to use it for giro purely 1% back.Or u want to just use it for 4.6% interest.Looks like now cannot have both like before. I agree preciously can have 4.6% on top 1% on giro portion,btohqsg
Maybe other expert have better knowledge how hsbc ega handle the fresh funds rule,btohqsg
Cool. Thanks UOB ðŸ¥°Fall below fee -$5 waived!,btohqsg
I would think the most important line in the tnc is the adb compare to the reference month. It just dont make sense when u afraid that they wipe u off the fresh fund interest when giro occur,btohqsg
Hi all. Would like to ask. Singsaver or moneysmart? Which one is faster and easier processing the welcome gift  ex. Ipad.  I believe both will take 5mos.,btohqsg
If u are concern  u can always earn interest on the giro amt in other acct then transfer in on deduction date,btohqsg
Heard moneysmart is faster but I've only used singsaver  and you're right is about 5months,btohqsg
Since u use singsaver the reward procdsud is how,btohqsg
After receiving the approval letter from bank we omitted the personal data like pin ans link in email and send them in pdf file OK?,btohqsg
Or wail till we spend 500,btohqsg
Then getting another email from bank ?,btohqsg
Hi all  just wanted to check in SCB app saw there is a pay & transfer. Can use it to pay for hawker center to earn miles as long it as the icon?,btohqsg
Holding journey card to be exact no bank account with scb,btohqsg
That one is pay now using your bank account doubt can pay with card,btohqsg
U want pay with card work like sgqr is amex pay for now after grab nerf and xnap gone,btohqsg
Call in right? I also want to waive,btohqsg
I think uob usually give 1 time so do maintain 1k average to avoid fee next time to be safe,btohqsg
Hi Everyone  Iâ€™m currently booking train rides for Europe. Will payment being made through Revolut better or UOB Krisflyer with amaze?,btohqsg
Revolut is better. Uob kf will only earn 1.2mpd.,btohqsg
Hi all. Just received a call from UOB CSO. They mentioned that the amt i deposited in 1st Jul is not eligible for UOB nations of savers as i have withdrawn the funds on 1st Jun.So i guess its time to shift funds out of UOB and prep for the next quarterly promoTL;DR Uob enforce 30 days clause,btohqsg
I used the chat bot (Live CSO).,btohqsg
Enjoy your holiday and forget about all these MCC. Last you want is your MCC become monkey ðŸ™‰ and you stressed.,btohqsg
I only believe after trying haha. See whether the system can enforce anot. At worst get 4 percent p.a interest then,btohqsg
WLWLWLBBQLI put on 2nd July. Withdrawn on 1st Jun. Can still argue but eventually UOB should win because 1st July promo period date die die wonâ€™t change. Itâ€™s like National Day is 9 August  how to change?,btohqsg
Weird. Both my wife & myself waive can leh. But we did few days ago liao.,btohqsg
But 0.58% is on a few 100's of k  the 1% is on a few hundreds or thousands only... But for me  I won't completely do away with giro.Yammyif you are so concerned about the 1% bonus interest  just put your money with other banks and keep minimum balance in hsbc to get 1% cashback on all giro payments... I don't understand why you need to die die pair this 2 together... It can be separated as what others have suggested earlier.,btohqsg
Yeah. Thats my plan also. Haha. But this 1 dont think cso is wrong. Anyway i will empty out before sep,btohqsg
U cant completely wipe out for the whole month as money will go in and out with salary requirement and other stuff,btohqsg
As in u contacted them to confirm on eligibility for the promo and this is the call back response?,btohqsg
Yup. 1st call on mon cso say i eligible.then cso realise mistake so called me back earlier today to update,btohqsg
Haha not surprise bank being calculative. Usually not easy to earn extra $$ from bank,btohqsg
Hi  just to check if you have requested for a call back to confirm if your deposit amt on 1 Jul will qualify for e promo? Which channel did you do that? I called their hotline the CSO told me they won't know if my deposit is eligible or not... ðŸ˜°,btohqsg
Tnc is there in writing  the programing into the system is doable but guess will be a tough task.So the best guess is if amt got earmark or not when the time come after registration,btohqsg
Agree. Unfortunately will need to wait until end of Aug to know... If the info given by CSO is correct.,btohqsg
