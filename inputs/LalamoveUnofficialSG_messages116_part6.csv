Beware bro  bcse it happened to me. I picked up 3 packets of durian. Then when i go in my van  the order cancelled. So i take it as it‚Äôs cancelled. Then I continue do other orders for like 3hrs. Then when i check back my app  the durian order suddenly on going. So i deliver one by one  the next day they tell me the food all spoiled alrdy  so I explained to them what happen. Then in 2 weeks they sent me this text on whatsapp and my account suspended.,btohqsg

But so far so good.. no complaints lol never kena suspend too,btohqsg

The SOP for llm is to return the parcel. We got used to keeping the food on cancelling  but that is only the food platforms' SOP  not llm's. In llm  the courier is liable for loss or damage of the parcel - you signed the TOC when you signed up for llm. That's why llm can charge damage or loss to the courier  even for food.,btohqsg
if return the food  will end up in the rubbish bin. might as well eat it. lol,btohqsg
yes  but you just need to be covered by black and white  or the customer can pin it on you. has already happened to a few couriers.,btohqsg
no need to scare. I ever done 4 jobs concurrently. lol.,btohqsg
remember some courier posted being made to paid for damaged cake and another one for cancelled durian order.,btohqsg
