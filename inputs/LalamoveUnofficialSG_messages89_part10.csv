Guys sry for the stupid question,btohqsg
But if got multi stop order  and the customer agree i can plan my own route,btohqsg
Is there a way to change the order on the app,btohqsg
you can plot your own order in google maps  but u have to key in the stops.,btohqsg
if cx ok with own route then is ok.,btohqsg
some cx promised a delivery timing so are more fussy about order.,btohqsg
Ok  but the app says proceeding to drop off point #6  but then im going #1 first,btohqsg
So i just press drop off at every place  dont care about the order on the app?,btohqsg
"think safer to ""drop off"" late. as in  if havent drop off that location  dont press. always take the POD picture.",btohqsg
There is an option to change nxt drop off pt,btohqsg
It's at the top of the job orders  above the map pic,btohqsg
Normally will show u the next drop off location  there's an icon to press to change the location,btohqsg
