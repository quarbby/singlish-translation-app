Just saw a lot of less than a year tesla for sale. Not sure what this means... Car installment too ex to maintain or too fast to drive or got problem?,btohqsg
The PIs just buy and then put up for sale.,btohqsg
Most of them are from Car Choice SG if you noticed.,btohqsg

rich man problem. they change cars like change gf,btohqsg
Wah  my gf of 8 years became my wife of 14 years,btohqsg
👍👍👍 Never thought of it this way 😂,btohqsg
What does that mean ? The listing is fake ?,btohqsg
I wouldn’t say fake but those are likely their 72 hours test drive cars.,btohqsg
So if they happen to sell them  then it’s a plus for them?,btohqsg
A few reasons1. As@mewmartsaid  PIs buy to keep ready stock and sell as compared to waiting for order from Tesla2. Some owners realise not practical for them and want to move back to ICE or prefer something else3. Due to the higher COE people are selling relatively lower mileage cars at a slightly higher price than they paid to earn a profit,btohqsg
Wah nothing escape your spy radar,btohqsg
Though I find it hard to feel that it’s not practical especially when Teslas will have SC access,btohqsg
The charging availability is much better than those random EVs,btohqsg
Agree  but to some they still prefer the usual ICE and can't adjust to EV lifestyle yet. Just personal preference that they might have,btohqsg
Fair enough. No right or wrong too,btohqsg
Ya sure got some ppl like such,btohqsg
or maybe they invest in luna,btohqsg

Time to make back the money they lost over the last 2 years. No reason to purposely increase rates. Can just reinstate the previous rates. Not as though salaries sudden raise also.,btohqsg
Base on year recent statistic   household income above 20 k a month jump from 6% to 14% last year,btohqsg
Ya that why they even consider to increase ec housing ceiling and increase cpf cap,btohqsg
ERP rates will go up by S$1 at several expressway gantries in May and June. If you're on the road during peak hours  take note of these charges:https://cna.asia/3LuXGM3,btohqsg

Cause cross over and not much choice,btohqsg
i like volvo design + tesla damn plain leh,btohqsg
no my cup of tea ba,btohqsg
Usually older ppl like polestar   tesla model 3 they catch no balls and said too fast and is sedan,btohqsg
easier get in n out for older folks😂,btohqsg
Now most ppl don’t like sedan all like suv   even fwd suv they also like,btohqsg
But the way they drive suv is like driving rally car,btohqsg
i volvo boy la so i naturally prefer polestar lor... now my car is on same platform as Polestar 2 and i find it much improved and betyer looking,btohqsg
I don’t like suv alos body roll is bad haha,btohqsg
