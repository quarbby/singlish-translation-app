Anyone transfer out HSBC points already?,btohqsg
Honestly not that bad if u have other cards to supplement the nerf,btohqsg
yeah  still using it  pretty good   and considering there is no AF  its quite okay to keep it,btohqsg
Bonus UNI$ (Apr's spending) from lady's account is in (no breakdown yet  but jump in UNI$ balance),btohqsg
Good as a backup and also points expiry very long too,btohqsg
Still useful to purchase flight tickets from airline website directly,btohqsg
Yea I don‚Äôt see a need to cancel it since no fees also. Probably not as a must have card for most after the nerfs,btohqsg
Can the interest be still credit into Maribank when saving is $100k? Is it the same as GXS?,btohqsg
In your opinion.Which cards are must to have.,btohqsg
I like Crmc + amaze. If your spending consistently goes over 1k or travel often  can consider uob suites of cards.,btohqsg
Newbie question but whats CRMC that yall are talking about?,btohqsg
None  it depends on your spending habits and lifestyle. What is a must have for others may not be a must have for you,btohqsg
Yes agree.For me I would prefer to put hsbc revolution for dining./ kris payOnline shopping .Citi rewards card.General spending . AMEX ascend. Or 1 travel hsbc,btohqsg
Not advisable to draw out now  deadline is jan 25. Should accumulate more points to be transfer next year.,btohqsg
HSBC points under maintainance till today  can only start redeeming tomorrow,btohqsg
Yea. I also don‚Äôt know hsbc to use as what alr. As I don‚Äôt dine out often. And after the recent supermarket nerf,btohqsg
Cancel. Then wait 1 year. Then apply again for the NTB rewards?,btohqsg
I mean if you really want to  sure,btohqsg
Actually can still use .Citi rewards with amaze.SCB journey card.Uob lady card with selected categories.Bros correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg
I'm a cashback person  so it's still quite a high cashback for Shopee/Taobao/Dept stores. Its still 4mpd for miles chaser,btohqsg
Citi Reward + AmazeUob lady   PPV   Kris FlyerDbs woman   Attitudeocbc 90N Visastandcharter smart card,btohqsg
which credit card is good for lump sum insurance payment to earn miles ?,btohqsg
For me .2 cards are must to have .Citi rewards card.Hsbc revolution.Because they are 4 miles rewarded card. Not blocks of 5.,btohqsg
1. CitiRewards + Amaze2. DBSWWMC3. UOB Lady's,btohqsg
Go google best card for cardup if more then 3k and u willing to pay a fee  if less then 3k u can look at maybank visa infinite,btohqsg
for crmc can you see how much points you get for an individual transaction ?Or only can gauge ?,btohqsg
you can also gauge assuming the transaction starts from $1.for $1 1X Base Thank You Point9X Bonus Thank You PointRundown to the transaction amount (absolute value) for the points calculations,btohqsg
Anyone know if gxs bank is accepting new bank accounts? Downloaded the app more than a month ago and signed up but no response yet. Jest says you are on waiting list,btohqsg
Thr fair price voucher is available to buy in any fairprice?,btohqsg
Will MCC7011 earn the 4mpd for UOB preferred visa card if its online payment?,btohqsg
thanks for sharing  its not included in 1a(x) but not excluded in 2f(xv) either  i'm thinking its a no  right?,btohqsg
Under 1a(x)  selected online transactions has to be within the MCCs listed in the table to earn 4mpd. So ya  7011 will not get bonus.,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check if 1 cardup account can pay for multiple people‚Äôs tax payments?  üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi all  what is HSBC revolution good for nowadays after the nerf?,btohqsg
Retail  online shopping  non-generic travel (e.g. flights purchased directly from airlines),btohqsg
How do you get 4 miles per dollar on HSBC revo  it seems for the rewards it is 2.5 points for one mile,btohqsg
you get 10 pts per dollar on bonus cats,btohqsg
I mainly use it for retail spending and restaurants dine out.,btohqsg
i recently did paywave by revolution in restaurant  that one is not counted right? I feel sad now  haha,btohqsg
If MCC is 5812  you get 4mpd. If it's 5814  then 0.4mpd,btohqsg
hmm  so different restaurants may have different MCC?,btohqsg
Different location of the restaurant also may have different MCC. Mall vs hotel,btohqsg
It‚Äôs possible so it‚Äôs actually a risk unless you‚Äôve been there before and know the mcc,btohqsg
can do amaze wallet for quick check,btohqsg
Haha I see... So if some restaurant is mcc 5812  even if I pay with paywave  i should get 4mpd? I had originally thought paywave = contactless,btohqsg
Lols I have been on the waitlist for a year..,btohqsg
thanks everyone for the knowledge üëç it has helped me a lot,btohqsg
A payment for ‚Äòsnack by income‚Äô through maybank plat Visa card neither maybank horizon visa. Why would it be ?The same card can be used for other transactions,btohqsg

hi guys anyone know how ocbc snapshot average daily balance  is it the lowest amount of the day or ending balance of the day?,btohqsg
Hope its true and not take too longThe app has been temporarily suspended and removed from various app stores due to the completion of our Proof of Concept (POC) phase.We are pleased to announce that during the 12-month POC period  we observed substantial growth in XNAP app usage  highlighting strong interest in our platform.

can i also check how it calculate weekend? if i take out today is it going to update my balance of the day for saturday and sunday as today's balance too? or is saturday sunday balance already captured and if i take out today it only affect from today onwards?,btohqsg
Saturday and sunday is capture  so if u take it out now  only affect monday,btohqsg
Saturday still a working day  but Sunday is not. Sunday will always be based on Saturday end of day.,btohqsg
Is heymax miles even worth accumulating? The transfer partner I see doesn't include the ones I use i.e krisflyer,btohqsg
There was a promise to add KF but no timeline I think. For me  if it does not cost me anything extra  I will just get Max miles.,btohqsg
Oh I wanted to compare between applying CRMC through Singsaver for $300 + 16k max miles (if miles win) versus moneysmart $500 (300 paynow  200 landlease evoucher) but apparently moneysmart just stopped that promotion,btohqsg
Short answer is yes.Long answer is please stay tuned  I'm testing something,btohqsg
From xnap CSO. They replied my email,btohqsg
Hi guys  any suggestion which card(s) to use for insurance premiums?,btohqsg
my thoughts too.However the only time i had to make a decision between KF miles or max miles so far was for the SingSaver 4mpd on travel insurance.Other times the max miles were just bonus on top of what i would usually earn (KF/card points).,btohqsg
Depends how you are paying it,btohqsg
Any advice how to pay to optimise?,btohqsg
Counted for OCBC365  you get 3% cashback too.,btohqsg
"For OCBC365 card  utilities/telco are not under exclusion for OCBC360 acct $500 threshold but  remember  you will get 3% cashback only if it is ""recurring"" payment.",btohqsg
Click on the transactions to show more details.,btohqsg
Sry cant help much  i never used HSBC before. üòÖ hope some guru replies to you.,btohqsg

Shhhh. I aint complain about this hahaha. Hsbc IT just take ur own sweet time,btohqsg
Anyone knows why I can‚Äôt see the points in hsbc app?,btohqsg
In ur credit card  click View More then Redeem Your Points. Then you will see option for points history.,btohqsg
Not everyone has that option yet. Maybe wait till tomorrow,btohqsg
Interesting. I thought everyone will have the same app after updates. Official date is tomorrow so just wait ba.,btohqsg
If you have hsbc revolution.  You should be able to see your points,btohqsg
I do have  and I don‚Äôt see. I‚Äôll wait for tmr,btohqsg
Yes.. I just check mine. I view points by card. Can see,btohqsg

Use excel calculate safest. Plug in daily value. Divide by 31.,btohqsg
For example $151k x 30 / 31 = $146k. U won‚Äôt get full interest.,btohqsg
No bank will pay interest based on month end balance.,btohqsg
Oh  means in this case better to choose to break it into smallest possible denominations?Can I check is it because they have some rules on how to use the gift card like in blocks of $?,btohqsg
No. Break into size u usually use.If u break into $10 u cannot use multiple pieces at one go. Lugi.,btohqsg
Yes can sign up on top of the savings payout,btohqsg
OhBut usually grab ride like weird weird number  say it costs $33  how would you use the gift card?,btohqsg
Sir  Our May 2024 has 31 days.,btohqsg
Maybe go to the website and navigate first?,btohqsg
Then you will not get full interest in May. You need at least $150k x 31 days = $4.65 million (sum of end day balance) in May.,btohqsg

Can I clarify how many uni$ uob lady card will give you for 2k spending in your selected category? Assuming no promo (just the usual 4mpd),btohqsg
Really? I got only 400 uni$ with a purchase of a Singapore airlines ticket (2k) while travel is my category. This is a purchase about 6 weeks ago. How can I followed up with UOB about this?,btohqsg
Ah lady points will credited in 2 parts. Base points (400pts) when transaction is posted. Bonus points (3.6k pts) will be month end.,btohqsg
The bonus will come following mth. But u say 6 weeks ago mmm. Or did u recently change the category?,btohqsg
Call or do a live chat with them. If you spent in April  bonus would have been credited on 2nd May. Could be the category not captured properly.,btohqsg
No. Just sharing for those who have.,btohqsg
Which website or apps or travel agency you bought the ticket from?The bonus UNI$ shall be credited in first week of May if you bought it in April. You can double check the UNI$ now. It shall appear like ‚ÄúUOB Lady‚Äôs Card UNI$ - Travel‚Äù,btohqsg
Ya I have a feeling the category of that transaction doesn't match lady cat. Only got base pts but no bonus pts.,btohqsg
Is chocolate finance still under MAS,btohqsg

Many knew. it's up to the bank to close it. Potentially too many exploit then bank will patch it haha.,btohqsg
Now you knew. Enjoy ur sweet 1% ega.,btohqsg
As I just happen to consider using EGA to pay billsBeen a long time EGA user but only reap benefit from credit card spends  never on bills since giro is troublesomeBut since EGA nerfs on credit card spend I now have to reconsider using it to pay bills,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not really a hack ba  since you still get the same rewards but lesser efforts,btohqsg

UOB has this calculator here too.https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/rewards/ladys-card/index.page,btohqsg
Oh the screenshot example is 1k spend while N spent 2k.,btohqsg
do you manage to withdrew it or cant?,btohqsg
I asked to proceed withdrawal  and the lady said will take 1-2 biz days,btohqsg
probably trying to keep your money so they can invest and at the same time give u some benefits of the cash voucher,btohqsg
If dealer allows bank transfer and can afford to wait a few days for payment  I don‚Äôt see why not. But I am not sure which category is it for cardup.But car loan can.,btohqsg

I did it for car loan payment. But for your case of downpayment  I cant help.,btohqsg
My telegram search function always has issues one.I search for a keyword I used myself and yet I cannot find it.I mentioned before in another chat and some snarky members even thought I was trying to find excuses.,btohqsg
2.2k UNI$ for UOB Lady's Card. Unless you're using UOB Lady's Solitaire Card? Your previous messages also said you're using UOB Lady's Card.,btohqsg
Just wanna ask   is there a way to calculate the amount for FCY before making a purchase. Wanna compare using my CC vs Youtrip.,btohqsg
Ok my bad. Thanks for correcting. I admit I assumed it's lady solitaire. Anyway  the UOB calculator is good to use.,btohqsg
Quite safe to assume it will be about 3.8-4% on top of interbank spot rate if u use credit cards naked without amaze.,btohqsg
Minimally CC will charge 3.25% FX fee. Then add on their poor exchange rate.,btohqsg

The UOB One card is just an example right.I can use any other card  as long as its not excluded by the MCC of grab and still earn rewards on paying the balance.,btohqsg
Yes. Of course can. One free withdrawal per month. Ib no charge.But‚Ä¶‚Ä¶All correspondent banks will charge usd10 for inward tt.,btohqsg
Depends grab voucher from where. Some have conditions. Some no.,btohqsg
Looking to cover GetGo charges since CRMC doesn‚Äôt cover it as it‚Äôs considered travel. Would HSBC revolution or UOB Lady‚Äôs Card be better alternative?,btohqsg
Thinking of getting it from Heymax (which I think they're partnering with favepay?),btohqsg
Better check MCC. Hsbc also nerd some travel. Eg agoda,btohqsg

Oh good question. I had the same question during my recent trip too  but I use Revolut.. i think if it's in SGD  it'll convert to the local currency based on that day's exchange rate? Could be  not too sure,btohqsg
Blackrock iShares US Index fund so far only exclusive to Endowus platform like 1 year ago.https://youtu.be/NUuImRcNQ8s?si=9JzCBPUoilxtt-rH,btohqsg
"Yes  that's right. The idea is that if the rate is good  you can ""save"" the rate by converting beforehand",btohqsg
Just remember to lock the card after that in case of fraud,btohqsg
Hi all  stupid question regarding DBS giro paper form submission  can I just drop by a bank branch and handover the form or must it be mailed?,btohqsg
Giro paying for dbs bill or giro using dbs saving account?,btohqsg
Sorry  I was referring to pay DBS card bills via EGA,btohqsg
Must be mailed. But you can try queuing and waiting for your turn just to hand over the form to them  DBS staff most likely will turn you away. The time taken to process will still be 4-6 weeks.Before that you must have signature with HSBC also.,btohqsg
I did. They don‚Äôt allow anymore. Even  to cancel  still have to pay the annual fees. The only way to cancel is next year before the next annual fee kicks in,btohqsg
Don't make sense. You pay the fee to use for the next 12 months. How can they force you to pay and prevent you from cancelling?,btohqsg
Exactly. Told them that the fee is an upfront payment but they insist that cannot waive anymore.,btohqsg
Has the annual fee been posted? Did you miss their eligibility to waive?Cancellation should be clear cut one...,btohqsg
You can try calling again another day  sometimes CSO say different thing. They can‚Äôt stop you from cancelling your card,btohqsg
No need to q  just pass the form to the person manning the queue machine and tell him it's for giro  they will know,btohqsg
Haha sometimes you need to queue to reach the person manning the queue machine.. DBS queue forever long one,btohqsg
No need  just wait at a side and wait for him to be a bit free,btohqsg
Ppl queuing will just stare at you waiting there lo. See you buay paiseh or not only,btohqsg
I did that at a few banks  noone stare at me leh,btohqsg
Just received my $8 hsbc hongbao!üòÇ,btohqsg

Recently scb tighten a lot. I personally unable to get anymore credit card annual fee waivers for all my humans and have been progressively cancelling cards.,btohqsg
Cannot waive but if u cancel they can flatten the fee.,btohqsg
I did this at plaza sing dbs branch a few days ago.. went to hsbc to update my signature first  then went to dbs. The lady at queue counter at entrance gave me the giro form to fill up n told me to hand it over to someone at a counter on the left which i think is where the cheque deposit box is.. they just emphasised that they will not do any form of verification on their end (i suppose they meant the signature that i signed). Just submission of the form to hsbc..,btohqsg
Thanks for this!Let me check if HSBC has my signature in case account was opened online‚Ä¶ it was years ago when I had my advance account converted to EGA iirc,btohqsg
Can hand the form directly to branch? Any success stories so far?,btohqsg
Serious?I‚Äôm still thinking if I should cancel my SC spree card‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs offers 2% cash back for contactless and online spend‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs no longer available for application I think,btohqsg
Got it! Let me try to do it at the branch‚Ä¶ at least it‚Äôs still easier than mailing‚Ä¶ too much hassle just to send paper mail‚Ä¶ envelope‚Ä¶ stamp‚Ä¶ and waiting time,btohqsg
U mean the giro form for ega? I did it a few days ago at dbs..,btohqsg
Yes  wanna submit giro form for EGA for my DBS bills,btohqsg
Why need stamp? The business reply envelope is free. Print  tape  and drop.,btohqsg
I open EGA through online  no signature. I need go to hsbc branch to put signature?,btohqsg
Yeah thats what i did. Unless u have other accounts w them.,btohqsg
I think some bank don‚Äôt have? I recently print out the giro form from OCBC website  then mail out with my own stamp.. üò©,btohqsg

You guys have any idea  I apply credit card through Singsaver and submit reward form application on singsaver website 1-2 days ago  but today I went to check with my ARN number it shows my rewards applied to be empty,btohqsg

Just go branch fill and pass the form to staff  it is fasterm,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if paying renovations fees via CardUp  charging to UOB VI metal is valid to qualify for the current UOB sign up miles promotion ? As I saw that ipaymy is in the MCC exclusion list but didn't see for CardUp  just in case I missed out anything. Thanks,btohqsg
I am in the same boat,btohqsg
Dbs don't have I think  I submitted last month need buy stamp,btohqsg

Why are you asking back the same question? And it‚Äôs an exact copy and paste,btohqsg
Hi  I'm thinking of buying furniture of around RM10k in Malaysia. I'm considering whether to simply use cash  using Youtrip  or applying for a credit card to spend and earn cashback (but will incur currency conversion fee).If I'm not considering the credit card sign-up gifts  which option is more worth for making a one off overseas purchase? Thank you!,btohqsg
Depend if u want to pay 3.25 fee for miles or u want best exchange rate etc  not much cashback card can cover the 3.25-3.5 fcy fee,btohqsg
If I'm not into miles and simply into cashback  does pairing a Mastercard w Amaze makes it more worth than paying I cash? Thanksüôèüèª,btohqsg
Not much cashback cards offer high enough interest to cover the fx spread by amaze and usually there‚Äôs a 1k cap on your bonus points.I think a better option would be just go for fx free cards like youtrip or even trust card,btohqsg
Interm of ringgit wise i think ichange card is not bad with the rate,btohqsg
I read maybank family and friends are offering 8% cashback for RM spending.https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/personal/cards/credit/maybank-family-and-friends-mastercard.page#:~:text=8%25%20CASHBACK%20FOR%20MALAYSIAN%20RINGGIT This%20benefit%20is%20automatically%20included.,btohqsg
Cap at 312 spending lol  not exactly enough for a 10k rm spending,btohqsg
Hi  any tips for renovation loan?,btohqsg
Yeah you are right about stamp lolI just found the business envelope for DBS since it‚Äôs not attached together with the giro form (eg UOB bank)https://www.dbs.com.sg/iwov-resources/pdf/forms/business-reply-envelope.pdf,btohqsg
Yes I was referring to DBS and I just found the business envelope lol,btohqsg
I think better don‚Äôt risk itEven though it‚Äôs not stated as part of exclusion  but it‚Äôs up to the bank‚Äôs discretion if they want to consider cardup as eligible spend‚Ä¶ they can say no too,btohqsg
Probably can consider the current Maybank Horizon uncapped 3.2mpd FCY promo  I‚Äôm not too versed on treat points but if you‚Äôre not into miles prolly can exchange treat points into cash back or shopping vouchers (not sure if the rate is good),btohqsg
hihi  wish to check if it is worth to pay $196.2 for the annual fee for the N90 OCBC card for 10k miles ?,btohqsg
Was the due date for your cc statement with AF already paid/due then you call to request for waiver?,btohqsg
Not paid but already due  then I requested for fee waiver. All methods of request they don‚Äôt allow. Reason they said they‚Äôve waived it for many years for me in previous years. They can‚Äôt do it this time. Since this is an upfront payment  I will just use it until next year a month before the annual fees is due. Then I will cancel the card,btohqsg
Which card is that may I ask? üôè,btohqsg
If you have amaze + scb manhatten  can save on DCC and still earn ~$90 cashback provided min spending hit 3k sgd. But I'm not sure if manhatten can be added into instarem or not.,btohqsg
each person can only have 1 Amaze account.based on Amaze TnC  can only link a credit card to 1 Amaze accountwhich citibank card? Citi rewards 10x points is capped at 1k spend in statement month.,btohqsg

But once exceed 1k  they start charging 1% in local spending,btohqsg

To pay KKH bill with CRMC  should use health buddy or HealthHub for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Depend if u think paying 1 cent for 1.92 is worth or not. At this rate only taking biz class flight is worth it usually,btohqsg
Yes.I feel ocbc is worth.  Ocbc points can be transfer to kris flyer and marriot bonvy points.,btohqsg
Not worth. There are cheaper ways to buy miles.,btohqsg
Please advise which are the better ways,btohqsg
Usually I will pay 196 or 197 for the miles. Last year I paid 197 for uob kris flyer. And waited 3 months for the 10k miles,btohqsg
Ohyes can I ask why did salesforce (CRM) share price plummet yesterday? Haha,btohqsg
197 is the max I will pay for the miles. 497 for scb infinite visa.. I won't pay. I call up and cancel,btohqsg

For card up to earn miles. Better to use air miles card.,btohqsg
cardup is excluded from qualifying spend for hsbc t1.,btohqsg
Anyone has experience of uob one card not successful at being set up as recurring payment on SP app?,btohqsg
Mine failed during the verification step. I solved this by calling UOB and they said my card was locked for receiving OTP. They were able to unlock it and I could set up my recurring payment. Hope this helps,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. I called in uob too they said no problem on their part say its SP problem and i believe because i do other transactions with the card n receive OTP with no problem.. Then i went SP toa payoh counter they told me its uob problem ü§¶ü§¶ü§¶,btohqsg
Weird thing is previously no issue.. The problem only started last month,btohqsg
I had similar issue regarding insurance payment too. It kept failing on and off in different months even tho my credit limit is still sufficient. Both provider tell me it‚Äôs the other side at fault lol. They wanted to smoke me say coz didn‚Äôt input my expiry date for the card.,btohqsg
At the SP services counter i still purposely pay for something else in front of the counter lady when she say is it your credit limit over üôÑ,btohqsg
Their default mindset is always to blame something else,btohqsg

Hi Guys and ladies.I need help.I did not receive my 20k miles for travel one card. I am not charge for the annual fee. This is the 3rd month already . Criteria.  500 already achieved on month 1.,btohqsg
Talk to HSBC  nothing we can do for you.,btohqsg
I already spoken to the customer service last week. She say wait until may statement.,btohqsg
I am already bill for may statement for 105.. transport charges for May. But no annual fees was charges. Bros pls advise.,btohqsg
No one can help you in this case. Try calling their help line?,btohqsg
I called already.  She say wait for May statement.  May statement no annual fee charge.,btohqsg
then reach back to them. are you looking for someone who had the same issue and did something else than call the help line?,btohqsg
Ok I saw wrongly. Bring it up to HSBC help line again. Maybe note down the name of the person you talked to. Hold them accountable for what they said.,btohqsg
Normally you guys waited how long before annual fees is charged for travel 1 card?,btohqsg
Can i confirm on anytime fitness monthly auto deduction counts as eligible online transaction?,btohqsg

I know it's codes as online. I use HSBC and it counts. Not sure if it works for crmc though.,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it not 3 months yet,btohqsg
My problem with crcm is by the end of month  i already hit 1k cap. So ended up using random cards to trigger for miles,btohqsg
But they already bill me May statement,btohqsg
did you fulfil the min spend of qualifying transactions of 500 in march to april?,btohqsg
March I buy hotel points.  500$,btohqsg

The customer service lady ask me to continue wait,btohqsg
Of course I apply welcome gift,btohqsg

Previously citi premier miles also have this issue. Take me 3 weeks to solve this issue,btohqsg
Anybody think Singsaver is worse than moneysmart in terms of gift fulfilment consistency,btohqsg
Late gift eligibility confirmation or delayed of gift fulfilment?,btohqsg
Moneysmart can login to an account to track gift applied and status  Singsaver cannot  only can check with ARN that may be lost due to multiple cards application. Gift fulfilment is longer and may need constant emails to SS team or else it will be super delayed  compared to moneysmart which usually has faster gift fulfilment,btohqsg
I want to sign up OCBC credit card. Anyone know OCBC got any credit card roadshow ?,btohqsg
I rather have better gifts than a quick response. Never had the issue to need to send email to chase for gifts. Once fulfilled within 3 months I got the email to redeem my gift .Moneysmart goes by points which need multiple application to even redeem for a gift.,btohqsg
Usually no  seen a lot of citibank or sc roadshows only,btohqsg
moneysmart can choose between points and gift  this depends on what u have choosen,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt they give you the points then you redeem it for the gift?,btohqsg
Hmmm okay maybe I can wait,btohqsg
This could be the Fall of Instarem Amazehttps://youtu.be/LOZMVJSrNnk,btohqsg

For convenience. I can make top-ups using credit card and convert it into monthly installments.,btohqsg

Any recommendations for a card for wedding purchases?,btohqsg
Guys and ladies.Any of you do apply for the DBS attitude card. I feel is quite difficult to get . Need to spend 3k within 2 months  to get 53k miles including annual fee pay of 197,btohqsg
I personally feel is easier 2 years ago for citi premier miles spend 800 within 2 months to get about 30k miles. Within 1 month I already spend 380 on Chinese new year dinner. Remaining 2 months split into 2 months eat and shop.,btohqsg
If no choice can still buy vouchers if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
Mainly payment for banquet dinner and wedding shoots  car rentals  photography,btohqsg
You‚Äôre planning to use one card for all? It also depends on whether they allow you to split payments for different cards and what your banquet quote their mcc as to reap the most rewards,btohqsg
Haha currently I only have city bank cashback plus card. So I guess i only have this 2 options atm.,btohqsg
Most cashback cards should cover your banquet and wedding shoots. Miles is probably more restrictive with mcc in place and the max cap for bonus miles,btohqsg
1 thing bad about hsbc 1 travel card is.Can't use for card up to earn miles.And also has expire date . Compare to dbs attitude card & citi premier miles.,btohqsg

Hi does anyone know why dental clinics show 2MPD for citi premier miles card on heymax? Isit inaccurate and should be 1.2 MPD?Also would like to check if I do an installment plan with a dental clinic where they deduct money from my card monthly  would that be seen as online payment hence I should use card for 4MPD online payments? Or seen as offline payments?,btohqsg
2mpd is foreign currency. Installment no 4mpd of cos,btohqsg
Oh the moment u make instalment there‚Äôs no 4MPD even if you use e.g a card 4MPD with online payments?,btohqsg
You may want to share which clinic n which card you use.,btohqsg
Read the tnc mentioned I have not come across installment still have 4mpd cards.,btohqsg
Guys if I voluntary top-up cpf can I choose between OA/SA/MA or is auto distribute?,btohqsg

Brightside dental clinic  I was planning to use DBS Women world card,btohqsg
Ah I see‚Ä¶ so I guess instalment can‚Äôt,btohqsg

Does anyone know if Citi PayallService count towards the monthly cap for rewards / miles card ?,btohqsg
No  not included in the cap.,btohqsg
Hi Gurus I plan to open HSBC EGA in 1st Jun 2024.Kindly enlighten me if my understanding is correct as below:HSBC EGA got 2 Promo Interest:1. Bonus Interest Promo for 3.3%.2. HSBC Everyday+ Rewards for additional 1%.Total will be 4.35% (3.3+1+0.05 original interest)To get the Bonus Interest 3.3%  we need to SMS to register and keep the fund 2 mths such as Jun and July 2024. So  rightfully  the Bonus Interest will be credited by 30 Sep 2024  and in 1st August 2024  I can actually transfer all out to another bank.Then to get the additional 1% Interest  we need to fund transfer in 2k and can transfer out immediately to another 5 non-hsbc accounts. But this 1% only can get for 1 mth which is Jun 2024. July 2024 won't hv.Correct?,btohqsg
Yeah  in general your understanding is correct. Just that no need to immediately transfer out after transfer in 2K. You can take your time Another point is Interest for 2 will arrive earlier than 1  so no need to panic if you receive less than expected.,btohqsg
I thought the promotion is until end June only (01May to 30Jun2024)? Is there a new one ? Thanks,btohqsg
1. need to see if there is new promo in Jun.2. u get 1% on incremental monthly average balance wrt previous month for each month  if july mab is lower or same than jun mab then no 1% interest for jul,btohqsg
Hi All  just wanted to check if I apply card from singsaver. Will it get the welcome bonus from the bank as well?,btohqsg

Yeahh  plus got 2 longue access good enough for my lifestyle,btohqsg

440 pts = $1Spend $44 on eligible transactions  redeem $1:1/44 *100%= 2.27%,btohqsg
Can also advise me also how do we get 4mpd for Citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Actually ever since 2021 I got my first rewards card until now i would say is the local banks of rewards points due to blocks of 5 for rewards cards are more complicated..,btohqsg
Go read up on the card before you use,btohqsg
Or should I open this account today as tomorrow which is 1st Jun not sure got the same promo like now?,btohqsg
Have you done your own reading first before asking these questions?,btohqsg
May I check if hospital bill is eligible for cashback if I use Amex True Cashback card? I remember it was not part of thr nerf in2022/2023,btohqsg

Anyone knows for HSBC EGA Bonus interest promotion in June  since the details are not out yet  if I move my funds into the account on June 1st does it count towards the bonus interest once I register  or will it only count the bonus interest from the date I send the SMS?,btohqsg
Better keep at zero before registration  else they might have reason to void,btohqsg

Hi All. I would be traveling to MY soon. For Grab  should I link my payment directly to my CRMC or   Amaze+CRMC to get the most miles?,btohqsg
The first gift is suppose to be today as per the promo picture,btohqsg
Amaze+crmc. Cuz u b earning amaze pts too,btohqsg
I will be stopping amaze with the latest nerf. no worth it anymore,btohqsg
I use maybank fnf or if u have other maybank card cos got promo code,btohqsg
Care to share what promo code is that? To enter inside grab app?,btohqsg
But must be over 10 rm,btohqsg
I‚Äôm signing up amaze  anyone keen to share referral code?,btohqsg
amaze wallet seems to be swamped with top ups  have top-ups from different cards stuck pending for some hours,btohqsg
Grab within JB even a few km already 10rm. I think no issue.,btohqsg
Ya ppl rush to top up wallet first,btohqsg
Later i need to rmb to top more too haha,btohqsg
It is fine to msg anytime during the month of participation.Even if u SMS in on 10th June  the funds u had from 1-9th June still earns the promised rate.,btohqsg
if I understand correctky  top up with Paynow is still foc. no need rush to top up with master and visa.,btohqsg
Lol mastercard can get 1 percent from ega for me,btohqsg
U all pro. I never found a proper usage for amaze wallet other than just to cash out the amaze points.,btohqsg
For new open account on 28th May  I registered on 30th may  it entitle till 30 june  right? Or I still need to register on June again?,btohqsg
Every one withdraw from uob1 tomorrow?,btohqsg
I just received a letter from uob,btohqsg
Because i keep emptying out and then put back in for their promotions,btohqsg
they nid ur money to invest,btohqsg
So for those who r doing the same trick i am being your sacrificial lamb to show u at most 9 months they will do this liao,btohqsg
I think you also triggered off some AML flag too,btohqsg
Just use Chris's  pulled from his latest video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOZMVJSrNnküí¥ Instarem Amaze Code: NhkWBHhttps://hmsg.link/amaze,btohqsg
100k and 150k movement surely will raise suspicion la.. But thats how we r playing the game according to their promotion rules ma.. Especially previously was end of month balance,btohqsg
Are they even still relevant. It‚Äôs a backup to my YouTrip. lol,btohqsg
i use revolut becus can withdraw excess,btohqsg
You put this is it in uob ladies account?,btohqsg
Do u do the 2359 thing?,btohqsg
I also draw out 150 to 200 pay ocbc rewards outstanding sum,btohqsg
Then 28th. I put back...u draw. Out large sum.. but must able to put it back quickly,btohqsg
I've been rotating my funds around for a long time (not uob tho) but never kenna. It's common with so many high yield saving accounts giving bonus interest for only incremental balance. I don't see why others didn't kenna? Did you have other suspicious transactions?,btohqsg
Just big lump sum movement out and in at our so called right timing to maximise the high interest and promotions,btohqsg
I think they will check why $$$ go out of yr uob account,btohqsg
Erm... 200k also won't trigger if there's no STR. 200k to the banks is small cash flow.,btohqsg
360 is the first 3 numbers of his account number lol,btohqsg
Uob one acct la. Just the starting account number is 360.. Cannot be show all numbers ma,btohqsg
Be careful if this is uob ladys account. You may not be awarded 6 miles for your spending,btohqsg
Thats what i thought too.. But now it seems otherwise..,btohqsg
I've hit max daily limit of 250k... Nothing happened. Not once or twice.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  if buying a private property  paying mostly cash instead of loan  which cards is best to do so? Prefer Cashback over miles  but open to miles suggestions.And when paying the first 25% is to the law firm right? Still new to this  please advice. Thank you.,btohqsg
Good for u. I am just sharing what happened to me when i just moved the 150k out for the very last time,btohqsg
But why you move out $$,btohqsg
He just explained in the very first message he sent lol,btohqsg
Did you keep moving it to different accounts under other people's name? And did you receive money from different account under many different names? That could be one red flag for the bank.,btohqsg
Still waiting for hsbc ega Jun promotion...,btohqsg
I really see no reason why a bank will want to terminate your account if you had only transfer your money among your own name with different banks... I'm sure the banks have been seeing this commonly.Even player A & B should work fine in theory otherwise many here will kenna already. Lol,btohqsg
When u move to other bank the big sum... what you do with the $$ there,btohqsg
Yea he just suey to kena this. A lot have been doing this for dunno how long never see any issues. Or maybe got other transactions that got flagged,btohqsg
Why the letter didn't say how the bank is sending back to you your balance  usually there is this line,btohqsg
Prior to this did you get calls from Uob first?,btohqsg
Hi  just to ask about UOB big saving payout promo  my funds are supposed to be earmarked by today. But till today  I checked my funds have not been earmarked. Does that mean I‚Äôm not enrolled into it?,btohqsg
When did you register and make the fund transfer? You transfer exactly the fresh fund amount or calculate to the detailed of your March MAB,btohqsg
It is luck  doesn't mean the rest are safeBanks have been closing accounts since years ago and the amount transferred usually not super big too..,btohqsg
Ohh my bad. I checked I register on 8th May and my funds hit on the same day too. Seems according to the tnc. Should be earmarked by 28june,btohqsg
Yea if that‚Äôs the case should be June,btohqsg
How you know he never haha,btohqsg
Yes. Asking about why i moved all the funds and where my funds come from etc,btohqsg
I just frankly tell them capitalizing on their promotions,btohqsg
But where the funds come from and justifying my income that one abit jialat.. Previously i shared ever since my semi retirement and my illness i have declared close to zero income for income tax n also stopped contributing cpf ever since i hit all the limits,btohqsg
So for those who remember previously i alao asked what to do if they ask to provide documents to review credit limits,btohqsg
I think this is the suspicious part to them bah,btohqsg
Maybe in my appeal i shoudl write in i dont have active income i earn all passive income from honeymoney sg tricks üòÇ,btohqsg
Most probably my uob credit cards will be affected soon then...,btohqsg
May I ask u explicitly. Do u abuse the bank cut off timings to earn extra one day interest?,btohqsg
Can only rely on my amex le...,btohqsg
I can no longer justify this kind of credit limit with uob,btohqsg
Yes. I maximize to the max. Their clauses also never say cannot ma,btohqsg
This my friend. Is the reason u kennaAnother common reason is transfer to 3rd party. Different names human,btohqsg
For someone like u who move 250k on a daily basis that is peanuts la üòÇ,btohqsg
Just because earn them extra one day interest? So petty? üòÖ,btohqsg
If I spend like you  I'll never have such amount in my bank. üòÇ,btohqsg
RHB also actively closed those jokers who moved in money at say 10pm then move out at 1129pm or what. Hard ware zone many jokers kenna,btohqsg
Ok i am one of the joker now üòÖ,btohqsg
Meaning he transferred exactly on the last day right before the cutoff timing?,btohqsg
Yes i always do that to maximize,btohqsg
Another point is... If your account balance is very little like never go above 10k for the longest time  then suddenly you have a 100k coming in  that might trigger red flag... Vs if you always have 500k all along  then suddenly transfer of even 200k in/out won't trigger anything. U get what I mean?,btohqsg
But right before the cutoff timing got get more meh? Transfer in the morning should be won‚Äôt kena ba,btohqsg
For uob one acct is either 0 or 100k or these two months 150k. No point having 500k or 200k. That is not maximising,btohqsg
Wah ... means you not working previously.. but still have 100 k plus,btohqsg
I semi retire since 5 years ago but before that i earn quite abit la.. If not how to maximize cpf etc before 30 years old? üòÖ,btohqsg
This one I don't quite agree. The person maybe strike toto. Then pump $$ into the bank,btohqsg
Yes agree .. every year top up cpf to hit the interest ... but I heard you cannot draw out your cpf lump sum. Sum only little bit 1 to 2k plus every mth,btohqsg
No  it is multiple high transactions in and outflow over different months. You transfer in one time nothing will happen,btohqsg
Ok so they just keep harping on my extreme swing and now blame me for not updating my income documents despite several requests for the last few months.. Imo is just finding something to blame la,btohqsg
Like that if strike toto... must keep the ticket... later the bank don't believe... ask spire pool issue cheque bank in. Then from spore pool cheque should not be an issue,btohqsg
Yea.  Not thinking of touching those money. Just let it earn the max interests,btohqsg
Which part you don't agree? Lol... I'm not saying it's illegal to suddenly have lots of money. I'm saying it may trigger a red flag. When bank ask you to justify the source of the funds  just provide evidence and you should be fine. Only if you can't substantiate your source  then you could get into trouble with the banks.,btohqsg
You top up yourself or purely income,btohqsg
I have been paying max cpf monthly from my company account to myself as salary since 21years old after army. If i remember correctly long time ago was 4500 then 5000 then 5500 then 6000.. Now heard recently they doing little step increase but i no longer do it le..,btohqsg
Figures stated is salary that cpf board cap the cpf contribution at,btohqsg
Chey own business ah? No wonder,btohqsg
Set up the business just to deposit salary nia,btohqsg
Just tell the bank the source of funds is your own business,btohqsg
You say suddenly have 100k come in... that's why I say if strike toto must keep the ticket and photo copy the spore pool cheque. Or else if they ask questions then u can answer,btohqsg
No more le. Close the company ever since dont need to pay salary for cpf contributions. Thats why im semi retired since 5 years ago,btohqsg
Even if you encash a $20 toto ticket  you need to indicate your nric number behind. All these for audit  tracking purposes. For amount larger than 5k  you need to go to their office to collect. You can be sure there will be proper records  documentation.,btohqsg
Hi all. Where can I find the DBS Woman's Card Points breakdown in the DBS banking app/website?,btohqsg
What you have shared over here already sounds suspicious to me... Setting up company to pay max cpf to yourself... Terminate company cos don't need to top up anymore. üòÖ,btohqsg
Everyday? Or just every week to earn the free sunday interest? Sorry to ask cos i also do transaction (out) on Sunday...,btohqsg
Many people do it ma. Just need to have a proper accountant to submit the proper documents where salary is paid out properly and company make a loss with the director pumping in cash into the company.,btohqsg
I don't even dare to do the Sunday oneBut let's not feed people with these information  if they do then kena ban,btohqsg
I can understand him  if self employed will be able to understand,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing with us. Do you mean you do everyday for 9 months?,btohqsg
As a moe scholar set up a simple tuition agency is easy. Getting all the required license etc is convenient,btohqsg
Not everyday. Every week. Everyday abit too much hassle,btohqsg
Yup so its to help others to avoid the same pitfall. I dont gain anything from this.,btohqsg
Bro... The more you mention  the more red flags I'm seeing... Company making a loss  director pumping cash in  you receiving max cpf etc... Did your company even have a genuine business? Sounds like a scheme to move money around...,btohqsg
Lol i know almost all the bosses of the tuition centres that u can name in singapore and all do the same,btohqsg
As long as u as a director paying yourself a salary its not illegal. Proper documentation is important,btohqsg
If you have a genuine business  I don't see any issue then. üëç,btohqsg
Genuine business with brick and mortar with minimal staffs with revenue. Just never put much effort into it,btohqsg
Agree. Can even have multiple companies paying you multiple salaries  getting max cpf from multiple companies. It's all legal.,btohqsg
Exactly so i dunno what red flags,btohqsg
Its only when i close the company becauae i max out my cpf already i get jammed,btohqsg
Because cant justify to bank for holding that kind of credit limit without any income,btohqsg
Yes  can supplement my youtrip $400. But rates are slightly lousier than yt,btohqsg
For reference and benefit of others who are interested.,btohqsg

hi im a uni student i got a few qns about secured credit card- which credit card is best for everyday spending which supports secured credit card- for collateral will there be interest earned on the collateral for the FD?- what are the credit limit like for a 21 y.o without any salary on a secured credit card?thank you üôè,btohqsg

Last time I have a credit card also for student. If I not wrong credit limit is 500 to 600 . Citi bank,btohqsg
Can be 90-100 percent of deposit put,btohqsg
Guys and ladies. Do you all usually set credit limit for credit card you apply...,btohqsg
Curious on why need a Credit Card where Debit Card do the same thing. If you need a FD to secure it.,btohqsg
no  unless you specifically want a small credit limit,btohqsg
Haha.. I set up about 2500 for dbs woman card.. also no more set high l√†. Bonus point already cut to 1500,btohqsg
I dont think theres any harm in having a high credit limit?,btohqsg
a secured CC still comes with all the usual features of a CC. naturally if you don't need or want any of those features then a debit card works just fine,btohqsg
Maybe it's because credit card have better rewards? OP will have to see if needing a FD is worth it though,btohqsg
IMO. Got ways to cash out? If no  then no point having high limits. Cos i think overall limit is cap at MAS. Having higher limit (for my initial few cards) mean i could not apply for cards or get super low limits for subsequent application (for other banks).,btohqsg
Like some bros say high ticket expenses go for which no cap on spending . Eg uob kris flyer . That I feel set up 8 to 10k is ok,btohqsg
Thanks! Just changed mine to dbs wwmc for the following months,btohqsg

Really is the case of play stupid games win stupid prizes le.,btohqsg
so he probably didnt update his income records and possibly causes the account to suspend?,btohqsg
That one is they ask regarding my credit card. But now my credit card still ongoing but uob one acct asked to close. I am expecting credit card will be affected next.,btohqsg
I have been transparent with this group all along.,btohqsg
I didn't. Weird. Any reason why?,btohqsg
Well wait till u r retired and has no more income documents to show r u going to tell all the banks that u have no more income and volunteer them to stop all your credit cards?,btohqsg
Obviously just keep quiet n continue to maximise for as long as possible,btohqsg
This is the end I guess,btohqsg
Young punks still earning salary obviously easy to provide income documents,btohqsg
Wait till u retire n u try to provide documents to justify 69k credit limit per card,btohqsg
You sign up with anytime fitness outram right. I also pay 88$,btohqsg
Appealed. See whether its the end. Prepared to move to stan chart for the moment,btohqsg

Ocbc 365 for restaurant food. Uob one for 2k per month expenditure. Absolute cashback amex for 1.7% tru cashback for 1.5%. I already cut off many other cards. I dont need miles since most casinos overseas offer me free flights as long as i visit them when i go overseas.,btohqsg
Thats why cashback vs miles i always vote cashback üòÇ,btohqsg

Hi Chris  may I know where is your video talking about your own valuation of miles 1.25 cents per miles?,btohqsg
Actually at yew tee cc cuz at the time of sign up  it was discounted and $100 voucher for selected stores. Great deal cuz i went to IMM UA and got myself 50% on all items. Shopped for $200 worth of clothes.,btohqsg
Did you reach the last step? Seems need to wait 48 hours?,btohqsg
Then why did you stop your business just because you have maxed your cpf (FRS I assume)? You could have continue to build up your OA & SA and you won't have these income proof issues now...Or you could also tell them the truth and offer to place a FD with the banks to continue using their credit cards. If you place 100k FD with the bank  I don't think they will reject giving you a credit limit of 60k. Lol,btohqsg
I just realised something... If you only have saving account with a bank w/o credit card  they most likely won't bother asking you for proof of income out of a sudden... You kept mentioning about heavy reliance on credit cards  and showed us the 50k+ outstanding amount on your Amex card... Have you been paying min amount every mth or using advance cash withdrawal from your cards? If you are a good customer who paid the entire sum every month  I think the banks will love you and won't ask for your income for no reason...,btohqsg
Hi all! Was reading about the HSBC Revolution T&Cs which state ‚Äî‚ÄúReward points shall be calculated based on the total amount of Eligible Transaction posted into HSBC's credit card system within each qualifying calendar month  rounded down to the nearest SD1. Bonus Points are subject to a cap of 9 000 Bonus Points per calendar month  while Base Points are not subject to any cap.‚ÄùDoes this mean the $1k spend cap follows the calendar month for transactions posted within that month? e.g. if I made a purchase on the last day  of  the month  the transaction is still pending in app and would only be posted the next month - so this transaction would eat into next months $1k spend?,btohqsg
For those not have $ hold in uob1  do you withdraw today?,btohqsg
Yes. Before 10am to be safe. Don‚Äôt ask me why not 1pm 5pm 6pm.Just do it as early as possible to be safe.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure there is fishy business involved which triggered the initial enhanced due diligence by the bank which op ignored.The account closure is certainly not triggered by moving money out from the bank purely for monthly or periodic rotation basis.,btohqsg
Totally agree. And he sounds like a money mule to me. üôä Haha...,btohqsg
To be fair he may indeed be a financially successful individual but if u are moving huge amounts of money to and fro frequently without being able to easily prove your source of wealth  no banks will take u anymore after Fujian Gang saga.,btohqsg
Ohh is it like that for the UOB lady‚Äôs card too? Where the cap is on the calendar month but the transactions must be posted within that calendar month?,btohqsg
yea  nv received the qualifying sms for HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme. Mine end on 31 May,btohqsg
They might have stopped sending. As long as do as per tnc. Should not be an issue,btohqsg

Yeaa sounds like some AML flagged out by the bank and also the previous request for income documents and not providing it but still have large cash flows in the account just seems suspicious to the bank,btohqsg
The thing I don't like hsbc ega is the interest payment is only far away and no clear way to get the daily average balance unless u ask the customer service check for 2-3days,btohqsg
My consultant xris told me it‚Äôs higher and I trust him 100% without doubting.,btohqsg
Last month gave two tiers one. One less then 500k and one higher then 500k. Make it so complicated even their own customer service also cannot handle already but if u ask me I think small change if anything.If the scb esaver is 3.55%  t bills 3.65%  feel like all very similar already. I am putting some into stashaway 3.75% 3 months,btohqsg
Nobody will / should do above $360k since u lose out on the 1%. Hence the higher tier is moot,btohqsg
If I put in the fresh funds in scb esaver  when can I withdraw the funds? They mentioned within 30days of the promotion month  so 1 month after July?,btohqsg
Update.Revoult increase limit to 20k in wallet. To match youtrip.,btohqsg

Hi Gurus  can check for DBS live fresh card  understand that the rewards spending is based on calendar month. Just wondering if i spent on 30 May and it‚Äôs still pending now  isit consider May or June spending?,btohqsg
June if it‚Äôs based on calendar month,btohqsg
Okay  so it will be based on posted date instead of transaction date right?,btohqsg
Last month (May24) was 3.3% (incremental ADB < $500k) / 3.4% (incremental ADB >= $500k). Slight improvement for Jun24 since it's 3.4% single tier.,btohqsg
Guys .. any of you take up uob stash account . They are 5% interest per annum,btohqsg
You are right  i quoted the wrong message. Deleted for misinformation,btohqsg
Huh. Bro. Can advise on this. How you get 3%. Uob put base . 0.05. Bonus 4.95. So total 5%,btohqsg
They go by tier %. Similar to uob one. Only your last 30k get 5%,btohqsg
Literally in the website. Please read before sending,btohqsg
Means I have 30k . I have 5%  ?,btohqsg

Dbs is based on transaction month not posting month so is may,btohqsg
Again  reminder that if you've registered in May promo  please don't apply for Jun promo. Wait for July promo to be eligibleClause #7For example  if the customer has already registered for the May Everyday Global Account Bonus Interest Promotion then he/she will not be eligible to register for this Promotion.,btohqsg
Dbs is based on transaction date de not posting.,btohqsg
They say spending leh  not rewards,btohqsg
Dbs count reward based on transaction date. Other bank based on posting date. So even if u spend on last day of the month(may) and post in jun it is calculate under may,btohqsg
I heard cash management account also has a bit of risk be careful,btohqsg

May I ask if you guys find it too risky to have so many bank apps and investment apps on your phone? How do u guys protect them? Does it make sense if buy a iPhone just to put banking apps?,btohqsg
Have you read tnc? It is stated GIRO,btohqsg
Because iPhone u can't quite get scripts installed behind the apps but android can,btohqsg
Technically if your phone have been compromised in some means. It‚Äôs still possible   just reduce the chances of getting through apps and apks,btohqsg
Of course there is no perfect risk free way that's why asking this questions. I think having multiple financial apps are actually a risk itself,btohqsg
Best is to have good security practices and don‚Äôt visit dubious websites or install unofficial apps.,btohqsg
Tbh  if you are getting an iPhone just to do that then no  unless you don‚Äôt mind paying just for that sole purpose. All phones have an equal chance of being compromised just android have slightly more attack surface,btohqsg
Having a separate phone make sense. One phone u have banks  finance  singpass.... everything in one... and as u put aside u won't really download funny app on it,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs only for banking apps and not installing anything else  you don‚Äôt even need specifically an iPhone to do so. Since you won‚Äôt be doing anything else other that money related,btohqsg
Yea I can't deny the price tag hesitate as a backup device indeed,btohqsg
Side loading on android is the main concerns of worries for compromising.Which current Apple still don‚Äôt allow unless you reside in the EU.Android have been working to prevent malicious actions which recently added check and declaration on if you are using the ability to scanning of entire phone applications.Android 13 and above added malicious checker and verification when installing of applications now.From what I know some Chinese brand turn that feature off.Anyway just keep security update on and avoid  cheap phone due to lack of security updates.I work as a mobile app dev and it have been pain in the ass in recent time when both company policy change so much and so many declarations to do and remove certain permission that they deem bad like tracker or what not   I would say right android have improved a lot for security concern but issues is different brand handle it different comparing to Apple who is the only doing all the control.If you are really afraid then you can use Apple  for your daily. It still offer better security.It much more streamline and offer better security and also more features to help you with it or at least from a developer POV.I use iPhone mainly for all financial stuffs and Android for my games and what not ~,btohqsg
