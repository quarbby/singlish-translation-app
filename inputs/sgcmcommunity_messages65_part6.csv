There is no reasons to drive fast these days.,btohqsg

Some signal and accelerate to overtake,btohqsg

Very well like in army eh,btohqsg
i hardly see any mini bus or gp car on the road liao ah,btohqsg
put safety pin in between wires to stop that..wat is it called? i can't remember,btohqsg
If can cut ok la   if travel same speed as middle lane how to cut,btohqsg
I enjoy driving at middle or left lane   while my car is faster then overtaking lane,btohqsg
Observed the situation. These days when traffic so slow i still see impatient drivers zig zagging,btohqsg
Yes road hogging cause impatient driver,btohqsg
Yeah. Left lane become faster than lane 1,btohqsg
Left lane is faster then right lane,btohqsg
i still can see a lorry driver cut from 4th to last lane just to exit to clementi,btohqsg
Right lane ppl cursing at 80 km   left lane can drive at 90,btohqsg
These are the ones you siam instead of being hot headed with them,btohqsg
Waiting for Singapore increase speed limit by 10 km,btohqsg
Wait long long. Never reduce already since traffic so slow liao,btohqsg
I believe will increase In time to come   80 is way too slow for modern cars,btohqsg
Have to Ga Ga cut in,btohqsg
80 in mce? Ya. 100 best,btohqsg
to be fair  i was very near to the car behind me at the next lane. can feel it's breathing already,btohqsg
modern cars easily handle 100 km easily,btohqsg
Chill. Situations in sg roads not as bad as the causeways 🤣,btohqsg
ya 80-90 is like a joke now,btohqsg
Sg gov need to collect fines to cover tax deficits 🤣,btohqsg
alot still hogging with 70 -80,btohqsg
Because of red light cameras mainly. Trained to accustom to the speed. 😅,btohqsg
i mean speed camara said 70 u drive 79 also nothing happen,btohqsg
When I go at 70-80 at MCE I make sure to take the left lanes... Many still hog unaware/uncaring on lane 1,btohqsg
Worse is those already 60 still slow down to 50+... And lane 1,btohqsg
but very common to meet some 1 drive at 60,btohqsg
that's y highway everyday so jam . when u tot got accident in front,btohqsg
Nowadays when many approaching speed camera at expressway  some slow down to 60-70km/h,btohqsg
actually road hogging is an offencem but like never been enforce,btohqsg
give chance la...i sometimes drive at 80  90,btohqsg
I think by right lorries/vans/bus also cannot drive on 2nd lane,btohqsg
I’ve seen TP gesturing for heavy vehicles on lane 2 to go back to left most lane. 🫡,btohqsg
Saw that too...many ignore despite TP stares at them,btohqsg
I think your P plate too small. Should get the enhanced version 😉,btohqsg
Stuff that new car owners should have in their carModern cars are relatively complete  but living with one day-to-day requires several items. Here's what a newbie driver and first-time car owner should keep handy.👉🏻 What are your car essentials?➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Ya but how about lane 1 lol that driving below speed limit,btohqsg
how big? entire rear windscreen? hahah,btohqsg
Slow is not an offense hor. Esp when there are many aging drivers in their 70s still allow to drive as long they pass eyesight tests 😂,btohqsg
Don’t hog the fast lane ma,btohqsg
It just like walking or take escalator,btohqsg
They feel safe not being in the middle lane 🤣,btohqsg
Some even left a big gaps  enough to hold 3-car length at those speed,btohqsg
