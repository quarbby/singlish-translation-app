Bruh they rlly like no example no mark,btohqsg
“With reference to an example  explain blah blah blah “,btohqsg
Geog theory very ez  oni issue is the examples & evaluation,btohqsg

ehh ur pw how’s it gg,btohqsg
my tcher remarks damn lame hahaha,btohqsg
we dk what to change alr,btohqsg
My take on Econs since taking it years ago.It helps me understand the economy at an earlier age  and I was able to use the theory to invest in certain companies/stocks effectively,btohqsg
Its usage extend far beyond A Level,btohqsg
Last time there is no H2  but is as good as H2 level,btohqsg
My time H3 was called S paper.,btohqsg
H2 was introduced only in 2007 A level,btohqsg
since then there was 2 syllabus changes I think  at least for JC Physics,btohqsg
Also  if you ever require tuition or books help  it is generally easier to find for econs than for geography.Even for free materials  I find it easier to find for econs. Many famous textbooks around that will help.,btohqsg
At least that was how I brought my A level econs from E at J2 mid years to A by A level  all by finding materials that were around the school library  and a few from the internet.,btohqsg
been quite a while since logic gates lolIt is more Venn diagrams these days,btohqsg
Are Venn diagrams tested in jc,btohqsg
last 2 years they like 3 circles,btohqsg
at the actual A level itself,btohqsg
Sing the mickey mouse clubhouse song,btohqsg
Try doing that in school during exams. You will be gifted with a free session with the counsellor,btohqsg

Theres more theory for investment and stocks in general than the econs syllabus in jc,btohqsg
yes  but it forms a basis,btohqsg
of course  after that I would recommend taking a basic accounting module in university to understand accounts too,btohqsg
Sounded like one of zhou xing xing movie,btohqsg
One of the soundtrack used for his,btohqsg
But ofc the score is simplified  alot of bars removed cause its too fast and it exceeded the timing for syf piece,btohqsg
the starting melody sound similar to one of the other songs  I try to recall,btohqsg
Istg my seniors carried my section sia,btohqsg
oh yes  part of the melody a little similar,btohqsg
You played the simplified version or the actual piece,btohqsg
similar to the youtube version  probably we have less people,btohqsg
that time we borrowed people from Band because not enough Cello and Double Bass players,btohqsg
I only attended one time syf 😅,btohqsg
i lost it when his head hit the ceiling and the cabin light turned on lol,btohqsg
