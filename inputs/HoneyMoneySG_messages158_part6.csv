Hi  for Mari Credit Card  can I clarify if the foreign transaction fee is 3% but the cashback is 3%  does it simply mean that for foreign transactions it amounts to 0% foreign transaction fee? Thanks!,btohqsg
I know roughly how the funds work  redemption timeframe for mmf type funds are typically 3-5 days. I think the cause of concern is mismanagement and miscalculation at their end which is a worry. They did not keep their promise of instantaneous withdrawals due to huge amounts of withdrawals from investors.. i think is unexpected from CF. Am a late joiner of CF  after considering the credentials of the CEO and also the instantaneous withdrawals attraction. No doubt  there is alot of talk about the risk is not deserving. To me  is a smaller start up that works like any other fund house thus putting money in.I will wait abit longer  when CF is ready and has strengthened their management execution and not wobbly like now  then I will consider putting my funds back in.,btohqsg
yes but they have 4.5% rebate promo now,btohqsg
Just to double check when overseas its better to directly use UOB ladies for food instead of combining it with Amaze right,btohqsg
Dont use uob cc with amaze. No miles.,btohqsg
Hi I am looking to set up my first privilege banking account and would like to know if anyone has any thoughts on which would be the best option to go for?,btohqsg
Hi all experts  eh with the Amaze card now introducing the 1% charge for all SGD transactions  what is the strategy for the CitiRewards card  or should use other cards instead to earn miles? Appreciate the advice  haha,btohqsg
PPVChris made a vid for this too..,btohqsg
CRMC still can be used for online transactions that are not excluded,btohqsg
Need 10k iirc  the statement will indicate how much more you needed to waive annual fee,btohqsg
10k a year is like 833 monthly which to me feels damn high for sth only giving 1.6% cash back so I was wondering if there were ppl only fulfilling the $500 monthly for bonus 360 interest on this card and still can get a manual fee waiver from OCBC,btohqsg
Most OCBC credit cards are 10k annual spending for waival,btohqsg
Yeah  but ocbc don't have much good cc to clock ocbc360 spend category,btohqsg
Update: My funds are refunded about 1 hour ago. üôè,btohqsg
