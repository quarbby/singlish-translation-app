You still need to have the tng card for toll payment on Malaysia customs,btohqsg
aiya no point... i don't go up north frequently enough,btohqsg
But after that use rfid to pay,btohqsg
I went up recently with a friend who was going up for the first time,btohqsg
He lost his tng at the second link petrol station,btohqsg
Then a bit further up at a shell we found rfid for him as they ran out of tng cards,btohqsg
i notice malaysians got like a handheld device kinda thing,btohqsg

Smart tag but it's a bit big. It's essentially an IU because you have to put the tng card in,btohqsg
Rfid is less bulky but you need to see where you can mount it as they recommend mounting on left headlight if your windscreen is tinted,btohqsg
And headlight mount need to be careful when washing,btohqsg
Funnily enough if you have a condo sticker or a phv sticker,btohqsg
That's the best place to put your rfid,btohqsg
anyway where is the cheapest place i can park near ocbc centre at church street?,btohqsg
Can use it as a map,btohqsg

i need interest rate to drop sial,btohqsg
Then lower the price then 😉,btohqsg
You wanna buy? 21k depre for MX-5 ND,btohqsg
Funnily enough even selling is hard at this point,btohqsg
Unless you have a very easy to move car,btohqsg
Because dealers also don't want their money tied up in the cars,btohqsg
Also if you're selling to a dealer you're still unlikely to get a very good price unless your car age is <5 years,btohqsg
As the market prices are indeed high but dealers are buying at low prices to be able to have enough wiggle room if the car cannot move quick enough,btohqsg

where’s all the “recycled COEs” from 2013,btohqsg
all not scrapping their cars anymore,btohqsg
depends leh. ytd that straits time article come out. suppose to dampen Car market or smth. then suddenly now shoot,btohqsg
now the main issue is whether sell high  the buy will be higher anot,btohqsg
i think if they willing to slash their margins,btohqsg
then the Buy won’t be high,btohqsg
Likely higher purely based on interest rates,btohqsg
Higher compared to what you have for sure,btohqsg
i think anyhow any dealer also will quote 2.78%,btohqsg
the 1.68 or 1.88 days are over alr,btohqsg
Cause that’s the “market rate” now,btohqsg
Because most cars held by a few big players,btohqsg
dunno where all these COEs stuck there for what,btohqsg
Scrapped in lots to control the values,btohqsg
maybe left pocket in right pocket out,btohqsg
If car sharing co.s and phv co.s dumped one shot,btohqsg
but ya.. Got what Cat A cars can even encourage so much demand sia,btohqsg
And not good for their business,btohqsg
Most starter conti cars are cat A now,btohqsg
i mean they cannot be infinitely expanding their fleet right,btohqsg
speaking of this  i think the only decent one for this starter conti is the 2 GC or the 1 series from BMW,btohqsg
That's what they want to do  if the COE is high they can discourage car ownership and the demand for taxis and car sharing automatically goes up,btohqsg
the Audi A3 and A class all these totally is so bad,btohqsg
In terms of equipment Merc quite ok but that's about all they offer,btohqsg
the BMW 1 is really not bad leh,btohqsg
Need to see what powertrain you get,btohqsg
Good enough for a man like me,btohqsg
Standard on the a class as well,btohqsg
but i think now only got 116 right,btohqsg
but 116 now itself 200k alr,btohqsg
if u gna get 116  might as well get 216  gran coupe,btohqsg
ok lor. see see look look 1st next time,btohqsg

Er...I would think the cam car shouldn't be going straight  both the cam car and the police car should be taking the first right turn from that 2 lanes,btohqsg
If the police car go straight  then sala also,btohqsg
It's like in the cross junction the right most car either u turn if allowed or turn right  but cannot go straight or cross to middle lane,btohqsg
@adminyou sure in the article the police car really wrong meh,btohqsg
Admin now is not @ admin ah? 🤭🤭☺️,btohqsg
Then how come the rest of the car infront go straight,btohqsg
Or rather  how come the police didn't summon the cars in front 😂😂😂,btohqsg
That Junction its indicated right turn only cus cte exit to braddell road got 3 lanes,btohqsg
Right 2 turn right left turn left,btohqsg
I live there. Im pretty sure I know how there works. I call tat junction 8 way cus it really goes 8 ways. Left straight right n u turn. Then from slip road exit u only can turn left or right. Or u turn.,btohqsg
u know there further up got 1 more junction,btohqsg
yeah its the exact same confusing junction,btohqsg
Why I never see you when I pass by there one? Must be nice living at a junction.  Get to see all kinds of nice cars. 🤣🤣,btohqsg

Sorry sir think you confused horse and torque,btohqsg
I feel its good what they did w stonic but they should up a notch w the sedans least on par w their i30s,btohqsg
The kia still got enough power to overtake road hoggers,btohqsg
Yes w all respect  I'm all for it to stay within 130bhp topspeed sufficient for cat A. But they need to do something w their 150nm and 13km/l else they'll lose interest w youngsters,btohqsg
Your foot heavy enough can overtake anything,btohqsg
look nice but price sure not nice... Hyundai selling more n more exp not like last time .,btohqsg
