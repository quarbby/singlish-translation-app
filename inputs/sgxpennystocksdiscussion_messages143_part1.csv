Earlier I cut the China Star Food - 900 lots 0.026 too.The players are collecting 26 I feel. But am on contra so no choice since they don‚Äôt give way.Will revisit this one when time comes.Good that they are recollecting but they will likely flush and collect cheaper from contra players that went in earlier.Not this time  perhaps the nextJohn,btohqsg
