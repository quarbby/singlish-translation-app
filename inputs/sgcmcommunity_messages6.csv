What is more important then 100 k coe,btohqsg
Anyone got a good workshop to recommend?,btohqsg
So its a UNicorn Topic now LOL,btohqsg
Some workshops are specialized in certain brand,btohqsg
Cant believe just less than a year ago  i bought a car where the COE is 30 plus K,btohqsg
Think as borders reopen ppl spend more on travelling,btohqsg
Previously all stuck in sg  nothing else to spend on so spend on cars probably,btohqsg
Like Bicycle also. Now lesser on the road i guess. Maybe now no resale value once borders opened,btohqsg
Din notice it until u mentioned it now,btohqsg
Maybe u will see lol. Used to have quite a number even on weekdays but i seen lesser. LOL or those who are still cycling is waiting for passport renewed,btohqsg

What the women did is not correct,btohqsg
But who is holding up the traffic,btohqsg
Looks more like the van is holding up the traffic,btohqsg
maybe is miss...@ic3l3mont3anever show us pic yet,btohqsg
I guess both have a part to play in holding up the traffic! But personally  I have yet to experience this,btohqsg
I only saw viral videos of similar incidents happen in China before,btohqsg

Yes… then go LeeDo  order cold crabs,btohqsg
Or go next door  buy new car,btohqsg
my PI is there lol sell them back LOL,btohqsg
See if your editor is interested to cover a story of an average income Singaporean owning a fun weekend car that easily I used as an excuse to bring my aging mum around; and bring smiles to the roads of Singapore =),btohqsg
What is a fun weekend car,btohqsg
Love to have an NA miata in the future. But sian leh the JDM tax in SG. So crazy,btohqsg
So whats the cheapest car in Singapore now?,btohqsg
New? I believe is Attrage. Now with (fake) ralliart package,btohqsg
All along its been the cheapest? Now hitting 100k an attrage/Spacestar,btohqsg
Perodua Bezza at 100 999?Malaysians will be laughing so hard for Singaporeans to buy RM300 000 Perodua Bezza in SG when they can buy a Mercedes Benz GLC base model in their homeland. lol,btohqsg
LTA will be super happy with so many sugar daddies and mommies shooting up COE!,btohqsg
Puapeh lol 101k For a Bezza?,btohqsg
Having a Cabrio/Convertible is definitely fun for sure.I never thought I would said that until I got one.(and also spend more time vaccuming the insides LOL),btohqsg
With high CEO  will we be seeing expensive cars and less of middle car commute vehicles type? Thus  middle Singaporean Can no longer afford to own cars while the wealthy and super wealthy can flex their wealth on the Singapore roads. Taxis and PHVs excluded.,btohqsg
Possible. The CS lancers are going to be a thing in the past as more and more are deregistrered away. Perhaps more BMWs and Mercedes Benz on the roads,btohqsg
Rolls Royce  Bentley  Aston  Lambo  Ferrari and McLaren,btohqsg
That too far fecth la   Median household income is at 9 k plus,btohqsg
Thats why alot PHV cause wanna drive HAHA,btohqsg
Likely he is using an apple lol,btohqsg
So median household can afford a 2nd hand car what,btohqsg
Everyday i walk pass showrooms i see alot of Cars ready to be delivered LOL including Porche,btohqsg
Yes it means it is still generally affordable,btohqsg
Affordable to higher wealth people maybe ><,btohqsg
COE only 10 years. Depreciation already 10K per year  if it’s 100k,btohqsg
Add body value loss of 2K a year  that is 1K expenses per month just to let a car sitting in the parking lot.Just make no sense unless you are printing money,btohqsg
Thts Why perodua sales very Low lor,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone wanna sell your fit/ jazz left 3-5years parf can PM ya. I got ready buyers. Thank you in advance! 🙏🏻☺️,btohqsg
Honda jazz left 3 years at 60k km,btohqsg
Full throttle beside police car also won't cause any alarm.0 to 100kph: YES,btohqsg
Only the mighty Singaporeans can afford it,btohqsg
this is like 1996. where proton wira sells at 90k. highest coe,btohqsg
In 1996  Sporeans could afford it surely now can pay even more,btohqsg
No wonder EK4 are so expensive now.,btohqsg
Your wife drives a 506 Hp is it??,btohqsg
fk8r worth buying? is it also rising,btohqsg
If I have the money to splurge  I will get a FD2R,btohqsg
In Singapore 🇸🇬  it’s much easier to find the Deutsche trinity than a small car brand,btohqsg
The Govt spent so much money this 2 years…. Which other cash generator is faster than this 2 weekPress once machine,btohqsg
fk8r is much better for all round use,btohqsg
Nothing beats 8K RPM. Plus  FD2R it is still way practical than most sports car.,btohqsg
only issue is that you have to find an unmolested one,btohqsg
then my m3 is way better. 8400 rpm,btohqsg
if you buy this shit   they will laugh at you. it means you wanted a car so badly cant afford a decent one but must buy nevertheless.,btohqsg
But really got people buy bezza in sg,btohqsg
Have  my carpark here got 3 bezza,btohqsg
Should be bought back then when its cheaper,btohqsg
Not todays coe bah? Lol 100k sia,btohqsg
But thats really the cheapest lo,btohqsg
i'd rather buy a used mazda 6 at 50k,btohqsg
When my aussie friend ask me how much is the cheapest car i say $100k they laugh lol they can get benz liao lol,btohqsg
Mazda 6 too huge for me,btohqsg
If mazda i will consider cx3 hahaha,btohqsg
Just a matter of getting used to,btohqsg
After some time  u will go vroomVroom vroom on the roads,btohqsg
it is. longer than my m3 and as wide as m3,btohqsg
After two years sinkies can claim innocence,btohqsg
Niama late night so many donkeys,btohqsg
really? can i see the real trades,btohqsg
Admin so hardworking. 10.43pm still at work 💪,btohqsg
wow.. this place zoo sio.. sir@ic3l3mont3a. got unicorn   got donkey   got horse.,btohqsg
Anyone tried selling their car on Sgcarmart before? As a direct seller instead of getting dealer to sell,btohqsg
What to expect after listing? How to know test drive party is genuinely interested to buy?,btohqsg
Good question. Also want to know.,btohqsg
Nowadays  can buy/sell HDB without agent. Should also be able to buy/sell without dealer.,btohqsg
When u list ur car as direct seller on carmart  they will ask if u want the seller kit,btohqsg
If u select yes  they will mail you everything you need to sell the car  including contract  step by step guide  test drive waiver,btohqsg
eh.. i tot all the forms can be downloaded online?,btohqsg
ya all those can be found online,btohqsg
i bought direct.. the seller went as far as car viewing and test drive started from the carpark beside rather than the carpark he usually parks at. avoid cunning dealers going to scratch the car after viewing and then lowering the price. haha in my opinion very extreme but to each his own,btohqsg
how to know genuine parties.. i think cannot la  just have to let them test drive lo,btohqsg
yes that is absolutely correct. In fact  once you've found a buyer already  u just need to send the Sales agreement to us and we will help u settle the rest,btohqsg
provided that you listed your car on sgCarMart 😂,btohqsg
That shows how bad the general reputation of used car dealers are:),btohqsg
Does sgcarmart help to settle the sellers car loan?,btohqsg
Yes  we help to do loan settlement for seller  and application for buyer,btohqsg
Good to know theres a credit company doing this. If not have to Loan from Loan shark HAHA,btohqsg
the service is called sgCarMart Connect. More info here :)https://connect.sgcarmart.com/,btohqsg
Got dealer telling me my phone would be flooded with calls  mostly dealers if I advertise,btohqsg
Then another dealer suggest why not I go direct instead of thru dealer  process is easy to manage,btohqsg
wa simi dealer ask u go direct lol,btohqsg
Manners maketh man: A well-dressed jaywalker gives cam car the middle finger for honking at himThis guy needs a slap to wake up his idea!🤬React with a 🤬  if you agree he needs a slap to wake up his idea!React with a 😄  if what the driver said towards the end made you laugh!React with a ❤️ for bothRead the full story👉🏻https://bit.ly/37nGwBY,btohqsg
Will he lose his job tmr? If this gets viral?,btohqsg
Why would he lose his job?😅,btohqsg
Anyone encounter using sgcarmart bidding flatflorm for selling  final bidded price agreed. Then meet dealer still want lower citing tis n that ?,btohqsg
The one pointing middle finger for jaywalking? Local? LOL,btohqsg
Get a temp prepaid SIM card with new number for this.,btohqsg
U will be flooded with dealers everywhere. First hand experience via carousell. Just ignore them,btohqsg
Will it make a difference if he's local or not? IMO  being rude is being rude lah  no need care about the person's nationality🤭,btohqsg
Not that. If this goes viral. If hes wearing uniform. Affect image ... ?,btohqsg
You can actually opt to leave out your phone number. And just get contacted via an email enquiry :),btohqsg
OH. Probably not  since the video is too pixelated to CSI him or his 'uniform' out. He may even be wearing his own suit and tie and not a uniform😆,btohqsg
Then ok more of these people on the road lol. Makes us a better place lOl. Peace Peace.,btohqsg
As drivers  we are mostly the one in the 'wrong' regardless of what we do in such a situation🥲,btohqsg
This was the old business model right? The new business model removes such a risk of dealers haggling down prices after bidding ends. What happens is sgCarMart will purchase the car over from the dealer and pay direct to seller  essentially removing that risk.,btohqsg
Yup correct. The Quotz bidding service ensures that sellers wont need to entertain any price haggling :),btohqsg
Anyone here used Quotz to sell their car before?,btohqsg
The Audi SQ5 Sportback is now available in Singapore!Sportiness  style and practicality summed up in one vehicle 🚗💨🤩👉🏻 React with 🥰 if you agree!👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you would love to drive this beauty!➡️ Click here to find outmore,btohqsg
If me I rather pay 100 to agent and do all the loan and paperwork for me then to do direct,btohqsg
few thousands probably.. dealers also need to eat eh,btohqsg
Ah.. my experience w them 2018… before this.. i see.. txs txs,btohqsg
Treat it like carousell? I bought my car from direct owner. So need to secure your own loan  transact by cashier order or as per instructed by the seller.,btohqsg
Yes… that’s what the sender wants to achieve lor…. But is ok one  he himself beware… u do the 1st  sure got pple do the 15th one,btohqsg
Can dun eat so much? Apply for loan  insurance   do online transfer pick up car and deliver car…. Still can get Comm for loans and insurance,btohqsg
Price will be slightly diff from trade in price rite?,btohqsg
Usually not 100 ah...more than that,btohqsg
Would there be a lemon concern?,btohqsg
Not exact the answer… I want to say I have asked SGCarMart to sell a couple of times and the “100s” of dealers always bid lower than my eventual seller to a random car dealer,btohqsg
Lemon law does not cover second hand car mkt,btohqsg
Definitely. Best if seller agrees to let you bring to a workshop to check.The bare minimum we have is LTA inspections  which sometimes is really inadequate.,btohqsg
er.. i tot it covers cars bought from second hand dealers?,btohqsg
U read their s n p,btohqsg
Even if have  by the time u enforce it…….,btohqsg
On paper it is covered. In actual fact can you mediate out of it is another question.,btohqsg
If you claim X is faulty  I am pretty sure dealer would say otherwise.,btohqsg
They will say it’s “wear and tear”…. Surely everything in the car is subject to wear and tear,btohqsg
2nd hand car mkt is really a lot of pattern,btohqsg
I salute them lah… really… a simple biz of buying from A  keep  sell to B also can have so many issues,btohqsg
okay la.. we can have our own experience but facts are facts. lemon law  is there even for used cars thru dealers.  though yeah i wont rely on it so better check gao gao myself,btohqsg
Second hand any pro can advise what to check,btohqsg
Other than the sta which I find useless,btohqsg
Oh I remembered one bro here asked about buying 2nd hand car rite? Be wary if the dealer let you test a car that has low fuel.,btohqsg
Dealer always put 145 or 150 points check,btohqsg
New or 2nd hand   all low fuel level leh.No 1 is going to give u free fuel lol,btohqsg
No  but the agent may try to hide wear out parts that can't be discovered unless you take the car out to test drive,btohqsg
I see some only allow testdrive in car park,btohqsg
Best is you have your own trusted ws to check for you,btohqsg
No ah  when I went for test drive  the fuel bar left 1 or 2 and the low fuel warning came out  so I didn't want to take it to highway test,btohqsg
When I drove back  discovered wheel bearing worn out,btohqsg
And he dared to claim their workshop has inspected. Didn't even noticed the 12v battery is already approaching 3yrs old,btohqsg
Says so much about their ws or integrity,btohqsg
A Bentley driver who used his car to push a security officer outside Red Swatiska School has been referred to the public prosecutor.https://cna.asia/3DVAdli,btohqsg
The prosecutor will determine if criminal charges will be brought against the driver,btohqsg
He can also ask police to investigate further,btohqsg
It used to be $500 many many years back.. Not sure about now 😆,btohqsg
"And dun get their so called ""package"" including seat covers  floor mats  even sound system cos very easy to kena chop",btohqsg
Around there ba...some quoted me 600  some 300. If they quote low  rest assured they'll recover it from other aspects,btohqsg
Good afternoon ! I’m new here ☺️,btohqsg
Can I check  is Honda Vezel good? 😁,btohqsg
Hmm... depends if u like SUV? Different people really different opinions. Haha,btohqsg
Haha I don’t mind SUV. Just looking around. Fuel efficient  good car ☺️,btohqsg
If can afford Hybrid is a good take i guess u can take a look at hybrid models like toyota Raize or Etc. I guess they are good,btohqsg
Go test drive and feel it =D No harm heh,btohqsg
Just that  my friend mentions that hybrid is normally around 30k more  so we save that much cost ? 🧐 any idea?,btohqsg
Hmmm... IMO at least.Hybrid is Fuel Efficient than the non hybrid counterpart. if u really can calculate u can try doing so. Or maybe check if anyone here have both and can give a better advise =D Hahaha.,btohqsg
Yup. Petrol version CVT gearboxPocket friendly,btohqsg
If you don't drive 200-300km per day.Don't need Hybrid,btohqsg
QasQai new model or? The back seat machiam hard hard stiff stiff. Sit long liao will YaoGu hmmm,btohqsg
Spent some money and redo seat .Redo in Malaysia 😉👍,btohqsg
Haha thank you for the suggestions !,btohqsg
Best is to go around test drive and do ur homework hehe,btohqsg
If you were thinking of honda vezel  give the Citroen C5 a try. Similar price & its comfortable,btohqsg
Can also consider Peugeot2008/3008for 1.2 L turbo as well 😉,btohqsg
Both Citroen & Peugeot uses the same engine. Just that C5 has hydraulic suspension cushion 😄,btohqsg
Er...can I mentioned a bro said something about a conti being priced similar to a Jap car? 😁😁😁,btohqsg
Am i missing something here? I mean he wasnt driving nicely  obviously impatient  tailgating and overtaking from the left but stuff like this happens all the time including from msian cars. Why the need to single him out?,btohqsg
I think is the whole team,btohqsg
Ah so its cos of the bmw convoy,btohqsg
Yepps. The msian police probably will catch them at custom bah. Sure need to come back de mah LOL,btohqsg
If so that makes more sense. The gold bmw is obviously a c ock but i dont think he should be specifically targeted by the police like that,btohqsg
Msia Boleh lo. Hahaha. We see whats the news upcoming hahaha. Even last time speed in HW also can get caught le this is even more obvious haha,btohqsg
I think now singaporeans still very visible. Need to lay low and behave for a while until things normalise. Lol,btohqsg
world will be a better place........,btohqsg
Dont think can lea with such people around lol. any SG car go in will be judge even u are Myvi LOL,btohqsg
Still have alot hogging at first 2nd Lanes,btohqsg
u see how fast the 10 cars behind the gold bmw driving.,btohqsg
got msia ford ranger also  not only singapore plates,btohqsg
Honestly. Before covid i found most road hogging morons on NS highway were singaporean cars,btohqsg
U mean right lane? Just go 110 if dw to hog and give way to speeders will be fine lo,btohqsg
Yep. Problem is they wont give way. Just one sotong 110kmh all the way on the right lane ‘cos speed limit already what’,btohqsg
Stupid local mentality. U see this all the time on our local highways,btohqsg
honestly this is the reason for 99% of 'aggressive driving',btohqsg
people wont overtake u from the left if overtaking lane clear,btohqsg
Agreed. It can be infuriating when ure in a rush to be somewhere,btohqsg
Then that one need to learn the msia HW code HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Dun say me lea i 100km/Hr on HW first lane de u wanna overtake u try lo. But if can siam i will lah,btohqsg
They are too stupid to have basic logic  reading the code also no use,btohqsg
But that video seems like they started off from traffic light or sth is it? Hahaha but nvm LOL,btohqsg
Same lah. But not everyone is like us. I always move over for faster traffic regardless of speed,btohqsg
As in The Mentality Give way Code on Msia HW,btohqsg
after the white mpv move left lane u see how many cars behind speed past hahahah,btohqsg
Yeah and i am like giving way to VANS going at 100km/Hr or more at Lane 1 LOL WHAT,btohqsg
At least he bother see his rear mirror HAHA,btohqsg
ya honestly if singaporean i think wont siam HAHAHA,btohqsg
lol if i saw a bicycle behind me at 100kmh i would still give way. Unlike many other sotongs,btohqsg
Hahaha a number of them heheh count us out Heh,btohqsg
Hahahahah who can do that HAHAHAHA.,btohqsg
Maybe got jet engine fitted lol,btohqsg
LoL their own also drove like that leh 😂😂,btohqsg
Moral of the story: i dont care how fast u going  on the fast lane  please give way to faster traffic,btohqsg
The art of hogging   our nation pride,btohqsg
Cause pay road tax and within speed limit I am the king,btohqsg
as a singaporean i being stereotype liao so sad,btohqsg
Yes some time the way they hog the lane I feel like so nicely executed,btohqsg
Make sure to leave no gap and maintian same pace with middle lane car,btohqsg
Make the leave a long long empty road infront   and a snake q behind,btohqsg
This is the art of hogging and some sinkie had master it   and will tell you that they had check with lta that within speed limit is not road hogging,btohqsg
Its hearing this BS excuse that triggers the hell out of me,btohqsg
Have you ever wonder   that the speed limit can be increase due to the overall efficiency and safety of current technology cars? Like overtaking lane speed limit is 20 km per hour more,btohqsg
It just make no sense that speed limits is the same for all lane,btohqsg
Slow lane I drive 90  middle lane 90   fast lane 90   how cars move around to exit and over take ?,btohqsg
You’re probably right but i doubt any of the civil servants or ministers would want to risk their careers on this because of the 0.00001% chance it backfires and accident rates skyrocket,btohqsg
They did talk about Speed limits during certain time to be lifted at a certain Range. Like Peak Hrs please maintain limit but where else there is lesser traffic period the limit is lifted or increased,btohqsg
When u make a million dollars a year to eat snakes for a living. Would you jeopardize it to help singaporean drivers out?,btohqsg
I mean 70kph on KPE is a complete joke. But there we have it,btohqsg
Most of the accident in the right lane is cause by over taking from left lane   and currently cars technology had really improve a lot   and most car come with anti collisions already   I drive car beside just auto pilot   I just feel like sleeping,btohqsg
How can 1 drive so slow,btohqsg
Just because of a 10-20 degree bend. Hilarious,btohqsg
But I think increase first lane speed is really good haha,btohqsg
I think we can mitigate risks by making small increases in speed limits at a time  then waiting a while to observe and collect data before doing it again. But noooooo thats not how things go in singapore. Rules are rules forever,btohqsg
Rules is to improve and change overtime ma,btohqsg
90 km speed limit is since like 30 years ago ? The cars back then and now is not comparable,btohqsg
u write a letter to lta or tp. I would love to hear their excuse,btohqsg
best is to enforce and penalize road hogger,btohqsg
Because u can be sure  they have an excuse ready and waiting,btohqsg
At least the situation will be much better when overtaking lane can hit 110,btohqsg
Overtaking lane is important as it ensure easy filtering   fast lane should overtake by traveling faster not slower,btohqsg
The theory fundamentally is wrong when overtaking lane is traveling at same speed with other lane,btohqsg
As it is difficult to change lane,btohqsg
is the ard that made such car so expensive   aboce 80k omv is at 220%,btohqsg
and to think it was 70 km/hr throughout when it first opened. what a joke ..,btohqsg
Actually Lornie HW also a Joke at 70Km/Hr,btohqsg
i think its 80 now? might be mistaken,btohqsg
still too low imo. its basically like a highway. can easily be 90,btohqsg
I dint notice but i think not lea LOL cause when u hit Adams lol 70kmh lol,btohqsg
yeah u might be right  not sure where i get that impression from,btohqsg
Thinking of buying a used car?sgCarMart is brainstorming different ways on how to make your next used car buying experience a pleasant and memorable one.We would greatly appreciate it if you could share with us your thoughts in this short 5-minute survey below.https://bit.ly/3uZKhFO,btohqsg
Nvm tmr i cfm lol. I will pass by HAHAHA,btohqsg
Once saw Coe Merc e class going 90 on nshw lane 1... Behind him got multiple my and sg cars.. joker refuse to give way until easily next rnr,btohqsg
seen this kinda nonsense soooo many times i lost count,btohqsg
use signal light  use flasher  no use. the more you try to get them to move  the more they hog  morons,btohqsg
Ya in the end after he exited to the rnr the whole convoy of msia and sg cars zoom past at 110,btohqsg
These are the same jokers that go 70+ on our lane 1 expressway,btohqsg
That why sometime actually they want give way but speed limit is 90 so they can’t give way as the middle lane car is also at 90 that why I said it is just not right when All the lane is the same speed,btohqsg
I did a test a few time my self at kpe   u see some 1 stuck there at 80 plus   then the middle lane is 80 plus   they will be at lane 1 till they can filter to lane 2 when he finally over take lane 2 cars,btohqsg
Challenger srt hellcat too! Although I don't think it's enough for a redeye model,btohqsg
Hahahah the paper below is better HAHAHAH,btohqsg
I think i saw cars and coffee imported a right hand drive one. Wonder if its sold yet,btohqsg
Must go into showroom i can only see GTR35 lol,btohqsg
Or maybe its in another building HAHA,btohqsg
Those I encounter as hoggers..all easily 20 below speed limit...in fact I end up undertaking them,btohqsg
Their commonwealth showroom u can see all the exotics when u drive past,btohqsg
I am quite near to their Kung Chung Road one near to Nissan showroom,btohqsg
Can name names here or privately?,btohqsg
Cheaper than a base 911 with coe,btohqsg
The corvette is rarer and more powerful than the base 911,btohqsg
Ya sorry 500k without coe without options,btohqsg
With coe and options would be about on par i guess,btohqsg
I personally prefer the corvette even though i like the 911. The real problem is parts and servicing/repair,btohqsg
Yupps hahaha comparable to Targa maybe or even lower lol,btohqsg
I suppose both also difficult to source and its rocket high haha,btohqsg
At least with porsche u have stuttgart,btohqsg
With corvette u really on ur own lol,btohqsg
Hahahah so u must know alot of dealership/Mechanics LOL,btohqsg
Or maybe u must be a mechanic urself lol,btohqsg
Thank you for participating in our survey  Kiat!😄,btohqsg
Cartimes  but dunno if he still with the company.,btohqsg
Yeap  so dun take it that big names dun have black sheep  have to be careful and less trusting.,btohqsg
True. I side on u LOL. I also cui with them lol but well lol inexperience me,btohqsg
You nego their price  they add elsewhere e.g. a 2nd hand pioneer DVD player for 500+ lol!,btohqsg
Wa 500+ is high end de ah?,btohqsg
Maybe can blast loud loud one or super bassy and surround-sound.,btohqsg

Really wonder if one day this sales process can be fully straight thru…. SGCarMart test drive….Gives a score and then let pple bid for the car etc,btohqsg
We are the biggest online car classifieds in Singapore already. Like you said when you talk about buying or selling a car  most people would say sgCarMart and not other competing companies.,btohqsg
Is it stilUnder SPH? Or sold to the SPH/MM2?,btohqsg
But of course we will never let this market leadership make us complacent. We are always looking at new ways to up our game,btohqsg
Broooooo. You haven't heard the news ah?,btohqsg

They should bring in the PI models themselves as in SGCarMart,btohqsg
LoL fair enough. It's usually the ppl that are the black sheep. But their attached ws are not up to mark.,btohqsg
Sgcarmart is just a platform that brings Marchants and customers together,btohqsg
Sgcm should get Toyota to hold a lucky draw  prize is a hybrid or ev 😂😂,btohqsg

Ya should be  model y no stock,btohqsg
And they just increase model 3 price again,btohqsg
Went pass its 70kmh limit hahaha,btohqsg
my bad  no idea where the idea for 80 came from lol. maybe cos i always drive that stretch at 80kmh,btohqsg
Yah worst sia 80 is machiam hogging,btohqsg
Someone insert a sticker of a hog or turtle,btohqsg
That was the closest I could find.,btohqsg
Kpe all the cameras area   will have a buffer speed limit   if it state 70   you drive 80 the flash so wont go off   that why u see ppl driving at 90 at 80 km road . The 70 km stretch is very jam is becuase of ppl driving below 70 and it is near to aye exit   which a lot of heavy vehicle is exiting .,btohqsg
Used car dealer. Perhaps someone can educate me. How does one start one? Seems the barrier to entry is very low. Is there a licensing requirement by the Government?,btohqsg
I think that Lornie got 6lanes Yo. Right lanes even at 80-90kmh also like slow LOL,btohqsg
overtaking should be 120-140 alr by now,btohqsg

Check this triple white beetle cabrio. (White body  white interior  white top).This is super white. 🙈,btohqsg
super white needs to be censored lol,btohqsg
The classic beetle are lovely cars for those who cannot afford Porsche 356 or 911  which the porsche tax will make you poor-schey.Recently there is a listing at SGCarmart for Beetle Carbio at 150K (black plate). Like wow....,btohqsg
i think with the beetle you do get a lot of cool factor but 911s have quite a striking driving experience and the tech in the moderns ones are super impressive,btohqsg
having said that  they are very different in price tier of course,btohqsg
We have unfiltered this word  but please refrain from abusive use of the word!🥰,btohqsg

I met a lot of such drivers on weekday rush hours. Not a good experience as they tend to bully slow cars like mine. I wasn't intentionally going turtle  I just give a longer distance with the car in front cos my brakes aren't as efficient as their big disc brakes with ABS.Sunday drive tends to me much better.,btohqsg

LTA Jamie says:You can swap the registration numbers of your existing vehicles of the same category (i.e. car to car  motorcycle to motorcycle  etc.). Go to our OneMotoring website > Digital Services > Swap Vehicle Number and login using your Singpass 2-Factor Authentication (2FA).The prescribed fee for each vehicle registration number retention and replacement is $1 300. Hence  the total fee payable to swap the registration numbers of your two vehicles would be $2 600 ($1 300 x 2 counts of number retention and replacement).,btohqsg
Actually why can’t they charge one time? Instead of considering it’s a natural flow from A to B or B to A  they take it as 2 separate transactions,btohqsg
Because they want to earn our $$$,btohqsg
"Did not know she so smart. I type ""swap vehicle number"" and 1st answer tio already.",btohqsg
Hahaha she already asked 1001Times Liao,btohqsg
Actually  the $1300 I already think very expensive. Nothing but an electronic record on their end,btohqsg
I ask her whether she is free for dinner… but she tell me how to check for free VEP days balance.,btohqsg
I think she outright rejected me,btohqsg

i use it even on old engine of 1990 and it is damn good and fuel saving,btohqsg
the bmw oil cap has castrol printed on it,btohqsg
So far I'm enjoying it. Previously on helix  Royal purple and redline I must say castrol is just as good haha not sure cause fresh oil after 10k,btohqsg
Ah nice I'll probably stick to this next 10k or maybe wanna try liquimoly,btohqsg

LoL almost 200k Liao the camry,btohqsg
https://www.facebook.com/groups/sgroadshallofshame/permalink/2284835941663902/This one really remove doors lol,btohqsg
Toyotas are priced ridiculously vs the competiton,btohqsg
No door is called Coupe ah? I tot lightstrike vehicle sia LOL,btohqsg
Actually thet car is good and the depreciation is ok,btohqsg
U see some brand car lose money like Siao when sold for the first 3 year,btohqsg
Now any car also chao chao 10+k depre lol,btohqsg
For 2nd hand but what I mean is u look at the 1st hand price compare to 2nd hand   some car really don’t hold value well,btohqsg
Hmmm True thats why for the 2nd hand cars due to the depre also some rather get a conti than other mades. Plus now COE hitting 6digit lol. For the next decade cui.,btohqsg
So cars to me like Toyota can buy 1 at hand as value hold well hehe,btohqsg
Are you sure it’s the conti that holds value,btohqsg
You have to look at the reputation of the make first,btohqsg
Not talking about holding value in this sentence rather is about if u wanna spend on a Conti or JDM for example,btohqsg
I think car model is more relevant,btohqsg
I used to have a camry. Loved it. Before that I didn't like Toyota simply because of the name. I preferred Mitsubishi.,btohqsg
Don't like American ones. Possibly not even Tesla.,btohqsg
How many out there can hold thier value with a steady market with buyers,btohqsg
Bro  no brainer question. Of course road users have to give way,btohqsg
I will always pre empt… if I see cyclist or pedestrian from a dist  I check to see if they are crossing,btohqsg
Sometimes they just suddenly increase their speed to cross the road  u won’t know,btohqsg
Feel like the car did slow down  but I think is more to check whether the pedestrian on the right is crossing… fail to check his left.,btohqsg
When I'm a pedestrian I feel bad when a car slows down for me. Because if we continue at the same pace  I would reach the crossing only after the car has passed.,btohqsg
There are different kinds of pedestrians… some dash to cross… some cross like empress dowager,btohqsg
How's your new cunti car? Humble as usual sir@ic3l3mont3a,btohqsg
See little kids on bike be careful lol,btohqsg
Have u gone to automart to take ur photo?,btohqsg
French  Italian(certain make)  Germans(certain make) and even Americans made cars residual values aren’t fantastic.,btohqsg
Resale market demands are probably Low for these made of cars  to the exception of Mercs and BMWs,btohqsg
It's a liability mate. Expect to lose money for it  that's it,btohqsg
Nonsense. This is not the case for our@ic3l3mont3a,btohqsg
Maybe later abit gotta work today LOL,btohqsg
Need to dress nicely  take nice photo  and post here,btohqsg
Why do I read your message as saying: because a conti depreciation in the 2nd hand mkt is usually same or lower than Toyota/Honda….pple prefer to buy 2nd hand Conti? Hahah (when new: assume conti more expensive than Japanese),btohqsg
