Domino pizza also but the staff will help,btohqsg
But heavy loads aside  after doing dominos once  made me think abt hygiene standards of our restaurants lol,btohqsg
I delivered cold dough laid out on stackable trays  not sealed  and while they were trying to fit it in my boot  several layers were exposed to road side pollution ü•¥,btohqsg

Don't bother. After that one time I took kfc order deliver 2 plastic pallets of chicken from tpy to ys. I banned them. Still can lie to me trolley can carry. My trolley broke ferrying it from kitchen to car. Then the juice from the chicken leaked to my car boot. Damn smelly.,btohqsg
And kfc seems to like to tuck themselves in old hdb estates where roads are narrow and loading is a pain,btohqsg
After my 1st time i also ban. I did a 2nd time is accept by mistake lol. That time old app tap too fast,btohqsg
Yes i kena also. From hg to sgoon. Aft tht i stopped eating kfc. Their hygiene standards are disgusting.,btohqsg
Not constant some time no do always do near near only üôÉ,btohqsg

Most hotel i picked.up all is label unless all is the same food item,btohqsg
yes but it‚Äôs ok shall see how,btohqsg
Had the same experience with an ice cream place in tampines. They ask me to pay 86 bucks.It will be words against words. If u truly think its the sender issue  then u have to stand firm. If you have any photos  message or whatever to show  or even car recordings  these may help.BTW  I got blacklisted by the ice cream sender  but I need not pay for the 86 bucks,btohqsg
Or if u feel the Cs person is difficult to talk  try live chat and engage another Cs.. It may work. But from my experience  ur tone and way of speaking to them will affect the outcome also. Must be nice to them.. If u are them  u wouldn't want to help and entertain a rude driver or rider.,btohqsg
If u can recall hard and find a way to prove it wasnt your fault  eg. Exact words/instructions staff said to u  even how they point to the bags and tell u which is which etcBut u got to be very sure u didnt interpret their instructions wrongly la,btohqsg
As a general note  i will always take a few seconds to note the customer's reaction when receiving the items from me - just to be sure i got the right house and they receive the right itemThere really are cheapskates who will pretend it is theirs  if u knock on wrong door,btohqsg
If multiple orders i will ask each customer to check they got the right items,btohqsg
When I stack I usually bring a marker,btohqsg
I label it myself write on the bag,btohqsg
Those do joo chiat rd careful,btohqsg
I kena take pic by the cisco,btohqsg
Do 3 job till i fell asleep while i drive. No job sia.,btohqsg
okay thank you guys for the tip! i still stand firm that the instructions given by the staff is incorrect. i explain like 2-3 times to different CS about the situation alr,btohqsg
shall see how it goes man. thanks a lot :),btohqsg
Who did a debt collection order? Saw it in the system. Help collect $13400. Alot money sia,btohqsg
Sounds like a prank to harass their client,btohqsg
Same now on investigation for food damage when delivered customer take never complaint . 2 days later say customer complaints food damage asking me to pay . I told y earlier never call they got my number . Waiting for outcome .,btohqsg
Pray then.. Hope all is well. üôè,btohqsg
I also complaint yr CS very hard to contact . Told yes working on it .,btohqsg
Told other incident reach customer place customer cancel order . Call customer never answer phone . The app not cancel . Cs say half also cannot pay  . Never get confirmation from them when the customer never answer the phone .,btohqsg
Just take note if customer never answer call . Call CS for confirmation see can proceed for the collection.,btohqsg
