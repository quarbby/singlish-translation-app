Sadly most in Singapore don't come with it,btohqsg

might be even heavier than the first owner,btohqsg
first owner usually lose 20% alr,btohqsg
If you will own for at least 5-7 years then new car ok,btohqsg
coe high when u buy second hand  coe drop when u own u lose way way more,btohqsg

It is also the perfect mix of oil and water,btohqsg
But for those with itchy backside like me  have to get those cars with <5yrs coe,btohqsg
You can always buy first hand if you know which car to buy and find the correct timing,btohqsg
HAHAHHAHHA you never fail to make my day with your unexpected jokes😆-R,btohqsg
Yeahh  year 3 onwards can save on the heavy depre,btohqsg
The heaviest depre stages are year 3 and year 5,btohqsg

All about buying at the right time in the cycle,btohqsg
Buy when COE low  sell when COE high can have chance to stay in the green,btohqsg

I would buy management unit if it wasnt very much abused by singaporeans,btohqsg
For example if you bought a Volvo S60 in 2018 just before the refresh,btohqsg
I dont want to buy a car that has been redlined for 8 hours 7 days a week for the past 5 months,btohqsg
Mine was ok. PA offered a 5 years warranty for it.,btohqsg
Unless you got a higher trim which is worth enough for the engine,btohqsg
PML most of management units is the staff use one,btohqsg
Lose abt 15 after 3 years of usage,btohqsg
even the test drive cars is the staff drive home kind,btohqsg
also i got a very good price la,btohqsg
squeezed the shit out of them,btohqsg
Must get good deal at both ends,btohqsg
Mine was used as their service shuttle limousine before lol. that’s what they say la,btohqsg
sold for 88k bought at arnd 105?,btohqsg
Must be management unit used by staff,btohqsg
cnc the AMG management units are 90% staff driven too,btohqsg
or sometimes  they could be loaners,btohqsg
but cnc majority test drive cars not a lot of cars the staff bring back,btohqsg
But need to judge the management also,btohqsg
either way  doubt the driver will gaf cos it isnt their car,btohqsg
Some staff really drive to whack only,btohqsg
Few months back bmw got promo for event cars used for air show that was pretty good deal,btohqsg
common . if i’m the sales team  i’ll whack it too,btohqsg

Air show cars not too bad but the spec isn't the highest,btohqsg
