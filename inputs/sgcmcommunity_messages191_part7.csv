Wrong again is different name same personality lol,btohqsg
Any BYD car owner ? BYD car reliable? BYD like recall their car in China for major issues.,btohqsg
All cars also have recall issue,btohqsg
Oh. Need to handover within a month,btohqsg
No because it's slow. Better get dual port cigarette socket charger,btohqsg
Ugreen has a 40W dual port charger,btohqsg
If you stop at 2 devices then a cigarette port charger is better. But then you have to think what you are going to power up because the USB ports on a hub max out around 500mA,btohqsg
No need to respond to troll so seriously 🙄,btohqsg
I agree but that's my personal thoughts so up to the person to decide.,btohqsg

The ugreen 40w but the cigar port got 40w?,btohqsg
Most cigar ports are 12V 10A or 12V 15A. Which is 120W or 180W so should be fine and adequate for iPhone/android fast charging.,btohqsg
Yes but depends on the vehichle la. From what I know some of the 12v cigarette outlet can support 120w or 180w max but best to check first,btohqsg
Get to try driving a sonata  rented that in KL,btohqsg
