Most likely  but that alone isnt enough cuz research,btohqsg
So far so good  i wan sleep cuz mye this monday,btohqsg
but this kind of intern how to get in,btohqsg
Then go thru rounds of interview,btohqsg
Need give portfolio and ur outstanding grades,btohqsg
is it long term intern tho sounds like it would demand q a bit of commitment,btohqsg
Some are 1 month  some are up to 3 or 4 months,btohqsg
A*star minimum attachment is 2 months i think,btohqsg
Then got other organisations need find somehow,btohqsg
i see  probably out of my depth rn,btohqsg
not much of a ‚Äòportfolio‚Äô to look at,btohqsg
Isokay  just source other types of internships ur interested looking into,btohqsg
probably don‚Äôt have a lot of time for them when sch starts cos its also q busy,btohqsg
which would make intern-seeking vv difficult anyways,btohqsg
Its up to u to make the best decision for urself,btohqsg
