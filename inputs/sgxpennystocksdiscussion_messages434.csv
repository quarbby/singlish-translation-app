The one who post tiger just now I also removed,btohqsg
yea was wondering why it was left there for so long haha. not your style,btohqsg
I see Sam working I chill,btohqsg
Personally  I find that Phase 2 HA is a little worse than last year tho. Haha.,btohqsg
i guess it's the feel of having almost same level of restriction tho the situation is quite diff haha,btohqsg
Makes it worse by the fact that it could have been avoided,btohqsg
Their main focus when we take the bruntIs how to open up,btohqsg
Wait I breakeven first  still red...,btohqsg
Yeah... actl do you feel that our situation is btr than last year?,btohqsg
95-year-old woman dies from complications due to COVID-19  taking Singapore's death toll to 33.https://cna.asia/3yR9DXi,btohqsg
Err it's better in the sense there's lesser cases for sure  but actually the hidden risk is high since the variant is so contagious and widespread in the community vs last yr whr it was mostly confined in dorms and easier to control the community spread of the virus,btohqsg
So I feel that we r not better or worse than last yr in some sense,btohqsg
I share the sentiments in that the numbers were better (i.e. less cases) than last year. I think what is taking a slight toll on my mental health is being paranoid about contracting the virus anytime and wherever I may choose to go? After all  I don't wish to be the carrier of the virus and spread it to my own family and members of the society. And this is probably why I feel slightly worse this time.,btohqsg
Last year is too much uncertainty that the CB is essential to reset everything,btohqsg
I feel u  haven't stepped into a mall or bot macs since that Friday.. too scared,btohqsg
I don't deny that the uncertainty is much lesser this round as we all have learned much on the fatality of this virus -- it is not that lethal w vaccines.Perhaps it's just that the little uncertainty is much closer to home this round  I feel a little worse than before.,btohqsg
Last year's outbreak in dorms... just seem slightly further away from home when compared to outbreak in community this time.Just sharing my own view. My apologies if anyone is offended by it.,btohqsg
Case of deja vuChinese bringing in cases. Scrambling before wuhan lockdown. Plenty came here. No stoppingFirst case eruptThough it‚Äôs a sooner or later thing  measures could be put up earlier but nopeWhen hoping lessons are learnt  same thing happened this year.,btohqsg
I agree when this virus first breakout  many will not know what it how to better manage. However  it‚Äôs been a year now and the authorities have always operating based on minimal effort until recent breakout. Surely when one is unsure  one should take more precaution instead of doing the minimal. The breakout of the Indian Variant in our community is really unacceptable.,btohqsg
Yeah... citing manpower needs for construction... and the govt might have just miscalculated the risk of a widespread of virus within the community.,btohqsg
Most of those who was COVID positiveAren‚Äôt construction workers,btohqsg
Then prestoNo need pre departure negative test to comeI thought all long needed,btohqsg
The irony is there are many positive cases found when they do pre departure test in sg,btohqsg
Travel overseas require negative testCome SG don‚Äôt need till now,btohqsg
Relax la  LW hinted pandemic will become endemic.Most population here vaccinated and there is medicine can treat the virus,btohqsg
Eh? Who come SG don't need?,btohqsg
Once all vaccinated it‚Äôs flu virus that‚Äôs,btohqsg
JUST IN: Singaporeans and PRs will have to take a pre-departure PCR test before returning to or transiting through Singapore.This updated measure will take effect from 11.59pm on May 29.https://str.sg/3kNNStay in the know:str.sg,btohqsg
If their negative test results mean anything,btohqsg
Everyone came with negative test results.,btohqsg
Not to mention the Indian family who came from NepalAnd cause changi cluster,btohqsg
They do a press release stating they did not come from IndiaEndSo meaningful,btohqsg
Biden has already taken mask after vaccinated,btohqsg
A new Covid-19 cluster has formed at the NTUC Foodfare at 308 Anchorvale Road  after 5 new cases were linked to the coffee shop on Sunday.Separately  a 95-year-old woman died from Covid-19 complications at Changi General Hospital.https://str.sg/3k2pStay in the know:str.sg,btohqsg
Ya now even sporeans/PR come back SG need negative results. In a way  not a welcomed news for overseas SG community.Foreigners coming in all the while need negative PCR,btohqsg
Clearly this measure has plenty of loopholesAfterall rules are meant for the abiding,btohqsg
anyone holding on to AMC  this will be an interesting read,btohqsg
Another vulnerable old lady pass away,btohqsg
Bro she is old and with record of cancer,btohqsg
I don't feel optimistic about his politicised decision to do away with masks. What makes him different from Trump then?He was just going the politically correct route to get votes during elections by saying wear a mask.But now... he's likely incentivising ppl to be vaccinated so there's no need to wear a mask.,btohqsg
If I see one young die because of covid then I scare,btohqsg
This is a HR disaster in the  making,btohqsg
I'm sure that our Singapore's situation shows the importance of mask even if we are vaccinated... I just dk how westerners are doing away w masks. But we shall see lor.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt spread fear of covid it is endemic that PM will tell you tomorrow,btohqsg
Ya I know. But never can my PM tell me dont need to wear a mask ah!!,btohqsg
Hahah if he really says so  I am like whut.,btohqsg
We should open up borders especially to India since all came with negative pcr test results and clearly we trust all their documentations. Why did we close it,btohqsg
Or should I state the 4 letter word,btohqsg
Closing border is wiseTake care our country first,btohqsg
Wait till young ones die then scare,btohqsg
But I wonderScared by then got bird use,btohqsg
Hahaaha you're quite right on this. Shall hear what PM lee says tmr,btohqsg
India everything can fake. Uni Degree can fake; PCR test result confirm fake!,btohqsg
Why are there no investigations on the numerous positive cases hereWho all got negative pcr resultsSo coincident meh our airport so toxic or airplane so dirty?,btohqsg
Gov got cheek to say the cluster start from helping a ‚Äòsouth Asian‚Äô family,btohqsg
Who all got negative test leh,btohqsg
Indeed .. even they don't trust their own one..,btohqsg
We are to recognise all their degree certWhen someone found to use a degree mill mastersEmployer claim was hired based on bachelor not masters,btohqsg
Sentiments exact! I think the mental fatigue is pretty real for most people.I think this ‚Äúconstraint/restriction‚Äùis affecting a lot of people  older folks especially...think those families with home abuse is also quite Jia lat...The list goes on...,btohqsg
Home abuseLast time drink and go home hootNow drink at home just hoot,btohqsg
Got negative testSomehow come here all positive,btohqsg
Pcr in India stands for whatPurposely created results?,btohqsg
Sigh. Ai khoon Liao don‚Äôt make me laugh lei lol,btohqsg
"Haha you really are great at dissecting the whole situation into a simple picture for some of us to digest on ""what probably went wrong w our Govt.""",btohqsg
Mai luan gong horOur gov never do wrong one,btohqsg
But they also sayIf there‚Äôs a mistake made I cannot let it go,btohqsg
Just realised that someone hit hard on SGHUAT today ,btohqsg
So I dunno what they want,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs also not really easy be gahmen. So many decisions and so many opinions.I guess for us as individuals just don‚Äôt gei kiang  do our part and hope this covid thing gets better...,btohqsg
Yeah that's right. There's a real mental fatigue coming along if tmr is about extension of Phase 2 HA till end of June. But I dm la  cos it's for the best due to an honest mistake anws ya.,btohqsg
