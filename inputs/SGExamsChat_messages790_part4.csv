This 23-year-old gave up being a RSAF regular and took a more-than-70% pay cut to move to a sleepy town in Kyushu to pursue his dream of playing pro baseball.Singapore‚Äôs national team captain Eleazar Ng tells CNA his story:https://cna.asia/44EGkI6,btohqsg
Have you all finished your WAs tho( to all JC students:)),btohqsg
If u do things with enough confidence u would be surprised as to the extent to which it can be pushed to,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcEbE_-cigAthey actually got mothership to do a interview,btohqsg
This was me before but i didnt want to make a scene,btohqsg
My bro dun seem to have any exams,btohqsg
hmmm maybe! I only know of his oral mt but cant be no exam till promos right,btohqsg
No MYE for 2024 JC/MI intake but some schools may have timed practices or whatever name they can come up with,btohqsg
Yes our sch has time practice,btohqsg
because you bro do not want your parents to know his results,btohqsg
And tbh i dont rly like that they removed myeTo quote my math cher  theres no mye and then only have the baby tests so the only big test in Y5 is promos. Then people may not be prepared for the big test,btohqsg
thats why he do not want parents to know he did badly,btohqsg
Yea  I am with you on thisRemoving MYE feels like kicking the can down the road ‚Äî that isn‚Äôt all too far down actually,btohqsg
got time practice or class tests even before mye is cancelled,btohqsg
now k2 got exams i heard,btohqsg
although no idea what the exams are for since pri school enrollment still uses the lottery system,btohqsg
Ya  but those were done in addition to MYENow  those are done in place of MYE,btohqsg
I feel like for me I will just have to do more time practice myself and take the baby test very seriouslyEspecially since I want to offer H3  the baby test must do well too,btohqsg
students need to have time management skills. timed practice students may not be serious,btohqsg
Yes i agree. In y4 i slept during all the time practice,btohqsg
Right now the next batch of p1 kids in my neighbourhood has these two as a lottery system,btohqsg
for my sec sch at least got mock prelim  in june or july i think,btohqsg
Do they call it mock prelim?,btohqsg
shld be  some of the dates have been confirmed,btohqsg
need check the parents gateway lol,btohqsg
Where all the basketball girls come from,btohqsg
Eunos primary has closed so now the lottery in my neihhbourhood is Telok Kurau primary and Maha Bodhi primary,btohqsg
for my sec school sec 4 NA students have two prelims,btohqsg
maha bodhi is massive for a pri school,btohqsg
Having dates fixed doesn‚Äôt mean they are called mock prelims though,btohqsg
Same pri sch as our founding father,btohqsg
i wholeheartedly agree on this too,btohqsg
cuz its like the national exam simulation,btohqsg
wait till they make it to Uni as well (which should be the goal for all JC students???),btohqsg
there's actually such a thing as mid term test at the half way point of each semester,btohqsg
to get 90rp just like you,btohqsg
i think you jumbled up the numbers,btohqsg
please dont ask me what noise a tortoise make cause..idk,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs see how this batch of J1 handle promos  if there is any outcry,btohqsg
nothing is impossible if i have a say in it,btohqsg
bruh what is that open ended please,btohqsg
i only got into NTU because my dada donated a lot of money,btohqsg
so that the first time we take the full paper in the exam environment isnt just at prelim,btohqsg
My goal is to get >80% for the subject that I want to offer the H3,btohqsg
And other subj cant be too bad or sch wont let you take h3,btohqsg
Schools will usually define what it means to be ‚Äúnot too bad‚Äù before the examsLucky that when I was a student  the criteria werent strict and I was allowed to do S paper (sorta H3) for chem despite flopping my f math ü§°,btohqsg
Their criteria is B for the h3 subj and. E for the restBut I feel like my other subj should minimally be B or C  to be able to cope with the H3,btohqsg
