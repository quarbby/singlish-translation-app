Rear wheel drive where they don‚Äôt cut corners,btohqsg
When I drive the m3 those who play with me are the Lexus. Others like bmw would stay far not near me.,btohqsg
Even Mercedes also likes to play. They‚Äôre like that. Quite annoying.,btohqsg
just wondering  how would someone indicate they want you to give way without getting close to you or flashing? if i see someone far away  i assume they dont intend to overtake,btohqsg
There are some that come so close  that put u at risk of having an accident,btohqsg

you are supposed to be on the lookout of faster vechicles in the fast lane if you continue to use the fast lane.,btohqsg
you cannot assume that just because he is far away and thus you occupy the fast lane. you are supposed to moved to the slower lane. that is courtesy,btohqsg
oh no la  wont risk a frontal collision just to get people to move,btohqsg
Do u see it in SG context? No.,btohqsg
yeah la. sigkies are like that they feel entitled that they hog the fast lane. ,btohqsg
unfortunately many people do not notice behind them  when i am on lane 1 i am constantly looking at rear view mirror. many drivers cruise on lane 1 in their own world  some even better using mounted mobile device,btohqsg
Not all drivers are zai‚Ä¶ some panick when they see a car so near their backside‚Ä¶,btohqsg
And the definition of near for everyone is different,btohqsg
you are suppose to check your rear view mirror very 5 seconds. If you see that the car behind is getting bigger in your mirror  what does that tell you?,btohqsg
in germany  i was in a car with my friend. he';s driving at 220~ and but he is always on the lookout for faster cars. he would stay on the slower lane even though he is doing fast. if he continues on the fast lane  be alert  faster car clsing in and he gives ways,btohqsg
They are on the same way as me,btohqsg
you are doing right. many lack this courtesy and education.,btohqsg
are they in the same rightmost lane as you?,btohqsg
what do you mean? as long as you see car behind you in the fast lane  switch over to let them pass. this is the way.,btohqsg
@ic3l3mont3a@lawryyyywe will reveal it next weeküëÄ,btohqsg
fast lane means you can never know othes can be faster than you.  and it is really meant for ovrtaking,btohqsg
No lah‚Ä¶ usually all lanes are full,btohqsg
And I‚Äôm on the fast lane to rush back home myself,btohqsg
Always rush to pick kids  rush to go back to do work,btohqsg
the rule is: switch to slow lane aftwr using fast lane when possible. you are deemed hogging the road if the slow lane is available for you,btohqsg
And the slow lane is too slow for my speed,btohqsg
that's just the best case scenario,btohqsg
when in jam.. all lanes are slow,btohqsg
Mine is a slow baby elephant,btohqsg
What is the most vfm car to buy now,btohqsg
actually if not for hoggers expressways wont really jam  next time jam take a look  somewhere far down the line you will see a car with no one infront and easily 10+ vehicles sticking close. can even see some constantly moving left and right to check if can overtake or not,btohqsg
I see Mitsubishi Outlander only 139k,btohqsg
Whoa i see only XXXk i fainted. LOL,btohqsg
then what is your concern? since you cannot speed up. the behind guy just have to suck thumb cos u are not the one hogging,btohqsg
Speeding up may cost u ur Points hahaa. If u exceeed alot just to move away,btohqsg
When coe was 46k  outlander was 115k,btohqsg
Whoa means back in my time. Outlander maybe less than 100k,btohqsg
if you got follow his post  you know those points you raised are not valid,btohqsg
you want to try to scroll up and read?,btohqsg
