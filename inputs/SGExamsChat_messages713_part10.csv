We are on Celestial mechanics and classical mechanics of Decartes and moving to Newton,btohqsg
wait thats sounds kinda cool to me,btohqsg
Basically all the well known ppl so start from Ptolemy Copernicus Kepler Galileo Decartes and then Now Newton,btohqsg
sounds like all the physics nerds,btohqsg
it's one of the topics in analytical mech,btohqsg
Yeah that's why I stayed it's damn cool but the content is damn dense,btohqsg
wait shit ya i need to do anal mech next sem,btohqsg
one of my fav mods i took tbh,btohqsg
It's like a Philosophy of Science thing tho very much so the evidence issue is kinda central.. like how do they even make and form the mathematical rigour,btohqsg
i will be the witness for that,btohqsg
All the time lmao tbh that's why I prefer to embrace non linear learning and thinking,btohqsg
it's less mindfucking imo bc end of the day it's classical mechanics,btohqsg
i guess its just when u grow older your brain just become more intensed,btohqsg
i'll have you know my mind was fucked already for classical mechanics...,btohqsg
i was literally hoping for a D walking out of that finals,btohqsg
can't be more than qm right,btohqsg
jury aint out yet for qm1,btohqsg
but so far the mid terms was pretty doable,btohqsg
I suspect its a routine thing,btohqsg
lol kuro the poly stuff you showed me...,btohqsg
ok my gripe with a levels is that the questions are easier when i look at it now but there's a lot of concepts that are just taken as fact,btohqsg
in poly Eng maths its just H1 maths i feel,btohqsg
and my brain is not ok with just accepting them lol,btohqsg
so i spend a lot of time digging into the why,btohqsg
ok maybe some topics are harder but,btohqsg
Thing is tho is that the philo part takes another degree just to cover that,btohqsg
Like in retrospect I understand algebra and why they need to work and why those law and rules are there in the first place la,btohqsg
But the actual reasoning behind that requires history also ngl and u gotta see the influence of thought and stuff like those.,btohqsg
not sure ur engineering have anot but for mine we did touch on stats,btohqsg
the intersection between science and philo is more interesting when you look at quantum side lol,btohqsg
like how many times this structure can withstand stress before it fail,btohqsg
when i was teaching my mentee i tried to give more perspective on some of the math,btohqsg
idk if it helped but eh,btohqsg
Oh I intend too assuming I make it through astronomy and mechanics,btohqsg
eh i have a funny question,btohqsg
that's been how i survived uni without doing tutorials,btohqsg
to sign up as a helper for any mod  is there a minimum grade requirement?,btohqsg
