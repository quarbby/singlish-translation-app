Is like 3 to 4 mods,btohqsg
Assuming each is 3 to 4 Aus,btohqsg
That's why we have fgo now :D,btohqsg
can help me with 4 and 5,btohqsg
oh yeah u take double deg u have almost no bde so almost no fgo. altho good thing is u can fgo all ur (very few) bdes lor,btohqsg
Actually 5 is very self explanatory,btohqsg
5b it's broader with the same depth5c double major students have the same expertise  they just add on additional stuff that is relevant tot heir industry (presumably),btohqsg
A double major means you have to take cores from both majors,btohqsg
Typically they have less bde  and hence  have limited choices in modules,btohqsg
It is an upgrade of su,btohqsg
but can see your result first,btohqsg
So now you can see result first before choosing to su,btohqsg
ur grade become pass fail so dont count towards gpa,btohqsg
im taking second degree  and i saw second degree and single major have 12SU AUs,btohqsg
I got a 0.13 increase in gpa from fgo-ing my bde last sem lol,btohqsg
im thinking between 1 and 1.5,btohqsg
for 5c  other than the fact that double major students are usually more able  on average  employers are willing to pay about 10% more if both majors are relevant to the job.,btohqsg
some small enterprises hardly look at second major as long as your degree match can alr,btohqsg
I think 4 is quite subjective,btohqsg
My dad's company is like that  the hr don't look at second major one,btohqsg
it's a plus la  but not too much,btohqsg
If the 2nd major boosts your single major; it may help,btohqsg
career prospects hard to tell tbh,btohqsg
Not saying is not possible to enter based on 2nd major uh,btohqsg
that one need you to find out yourself ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
But if you based on seeing all people wise,btohqsg
They wld definitely look into single major first,btohqsg
But even till then  is also about what work experiences you have also,btohqsg
"That's why ppl say comp sci graduates hard to find job because of ""oversaturation""",btohqsg
They have to actually show what makes them stand out,btohqsg
shld i get out of digital world,btohqsg
why sg job market suddenly liddat sia,btohqsg
thats why we shld go second major and do sth more broad?,btohqsg

Ok tbh i wldnt say to ignore the tech industry uh,btohqsg

But tbh even in any science or industry,btohqsg

At some point  they require some sort of technology,btohqsg
