It's not mandatory to put on your seatbelts when the plane is cruising as per the pilot's announcement,btohqsg
It's a matter of personal choice when the seatbelt light is off. When the plane experiences turbulence  the light comes on but it can be so sudden that people sleeping on a long flight might not have time to react if they are asleep,btohqsg
