worst case scenerio what do do if fail emath ah :(,btohqsg
Hmmm how about Th Nth term,btohqsg
Remember the bell curve for e math is rly high need to get like 90% for A1,btohqsg
Last year schools a1 rate was 90%,btohqsg
So prelim unless the sch paper is damn hard distinction rate would almost certainly fall,btohqsg
i was hesistant about putting empty brackets or,btohqsg
U wont fail. If u know u Revised then u wont,btohqsg
can i put it as { },btohqsg
I put O with a slash,btohqsg
but i ended up putting this {},btohqsg
Anyone got the pdf file for emaths paper?,btohqsg
âˆ… or {} should be accepted,btohqsg
But sadly because I put {âˆ…} I will probably lose one mark,btohqsg
but i failed for prelims : ),btohqsg
So u die p1 p2 do well,btohqsg
For my school for o levels,btohqsg
I put o slash anyway tho LOL,btohqsg
Btw how you know the A1 rate is 90% I thought schools would normally disclose distinction rate only which includes A2,btohqsg
But wat if u combine lol,btohqsg
My Cher say in some lvl briefing,btohqsg
Ur cher maybe trying to scare u,btohqsg
The other subjects distinction rate not very good,btohqsg
Likely cannot I heard itâ€™s mathematically wrong,btohqsg
Even my sch Amath 95% A not 95% A1,btohqsg
Its eithr O with slash or Empty bracket,btohqsg
Is it 2 to the power of ten or 32 squared,btohqsg
A lot of ppl do 32^2,btohqsg
But they ask for 2 no?,btohqsg
They probably thought they wanted a power of 2 for the base,btohqsg
did yall get - 24.something for completing square,btohqsg
"they said "" as a power of 2""",btohqsg
Ye so as a power of 2,btohqsg
Thats as a power of 32,btohqsg
Yeah so that must have confused people itâ€™s actually 2^10,btohqsg
This will become an element alrd,btohqsg
i was hfrjjjs changing it soo many timesss,btohqsg
got ppl ans sheet on reddit,btohqsg
Chester u donâ€™t even have o levels ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Shh i wanna see this year paper,btohqsg
Chester Os over or he next year?,btohqsg
If people need help in literature find me :),btohqsg
If nvr put the percen symbol leh?,btohqsg
I hope for 13b they accept +_ square root 4-0.25y,btohqsg
I bet a fair bit of people didnâ€™t put plus minus,btohqsg
wait will it be p or the entire thing wrong,btohqsg
Iâ€™m pretty sure u need put percentage tbh,btohqsg
was jt math paper tdy kil,btohqsg
No it was considered very easy,btohqsg
I knew it wasnâ€™t 13.5 for mean,btohqsg
Whole of Singapore will do well,btohqsg
No need they ask r% and what is r,btohqsg
bruh the thing wrong with the graph,btohqsg
But your answering in contact to the question,btohqsg
But if r% is 2.33%  shouldn't r be 2.33,btohqsg
cos it doesnt start frm 0,btohqsg
I lost like 5 marks alrd,btohqsg
wah if os all like that see u in np,btohqsg
p2 prolly gnna be damn hard,btohqsg
i'm p sure they gg give cubic graph in p2,btohqsg
I mean as long as u get 90% u shd be safe,btohqsg
wait will construction come out in p2?,btohqsg
since it didnt come out in p1,btohqsg
The bell curve gonna fuck the whole story,btohqsg
anyone has the paper in PDF?,btohqsg
wait 1 year for tys LOL,btohqsg
You canâ€™t do anything about it,btohqsg
Something tells me that A1 need full marks liao,btohqsg
My uncle works at Seab  he says 99 for A2,btohqsg
or no a1 at all lol,btohqsg
Good luck to u all if u actually believed that,btohqsg
how many marks the last qn ah,btohqsg
how was the math paper yall?,btohqsg
My senior messed up a tenth of the paper last year and he still got A1,btohqsg
2020's been a veryspecialyear so far,btohqsg
My cousinâ€™s friendâ€™s cat did all the questions perfectly and got A2,btohqsg

Won't count on seab being nice,btohqsg
Especially since they removed extra questions,btohqsg
They gonna be tough on everything else,btohqsg
Bro someone say kim get 83,btohqsg
u compare sg o levels to england o levels,btohqsg
Pure chem paper give fucking crossword puzzle,btohqsg
U should go take a look at the old papers,btohqsg
How can square root 4 to 2 ah. I thought still got -2 so just leave the whole thing as square root.,btohqsg
Chemistry at o levels is so nice,btohqsg
they ask u solve for x or something if i'm nt wrong,btohqsg
Chemistry at a higher level is lowkey maths,btohqsg
I decided to do data science instead,btohqsg
There's no excuse to get this wrong LOL,btohqsg
p2 is gonna be damm hard cfm,btohqsg
hello how did yâ€™all get 12/35 for probability ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
Further cementing my decision to avoid chemitsry,btohqsg
If u want to have an easy life  donâ€™t go into higher education,btohqsg
ya lorh Jay  dont flex on us,btohqsg
next time u be flexing on me daily,btohqsg
relax bedok  u still in sec sch,btohqsg
Ooo A union Bâ€™ is null.. meaning only set B has numbers,btohqsg
i mean some pure chem papers have chem eqm qns,btohqsg
H2 chemistry is a nightmare lol,btohqsg
''RI has not replied back to my DSA application '' ~Bedok,btohqsg
I thought you are concurrently in HC  NUSH  RI  Harbird all at once,btohqsg
I still will probably take h2 Chem oops,btohqsg
h2 chem is easier than above,btohqsg
what im sayin is if u intend to pursue chem aft poly/jc,btohqsg
H2 is where it starts to get fun,btohqsg
got quaffles ppl in my course gettin floored,btohqsg
tbh the pure chem part is fine for me,btohqsg
but im coping well surprisingly compared to physics students,btohqsg
Is h2 phy easier than h2 Chem ?,btohqsg
so dont need to worry if u dont know physics/suck at physics/no physics background,btohqsg
Organic is the most fun part  cause it has a problem solving feel to it,btohqsg
no comment cos i took h2 bio,btohqsg
Idk I probably will still do h2 Chem,btohqsg
Physical Chem is just whak calculations,btohqsg
Do u recommend taking up geopolitics ?,btohqsg
physical chem is beyond calculations for uni chemistry,btohqsg
What equations did you have to memorise again,btohqsg
off topic but dark black or dark blue mode?,btohqsg
blue is cute black is aesthetic,btohqsg
did u learnt the van't Hoff equation?,btohqsg
Good luck to u if u memorise that,btohqsg
did you learn how to differentiate Gibbs free equation?,btohqsg
I integrate rate law eqn to derive formula for half life,btohqsg
literally what came out for a math test,btohqsg
that almost no one could do,btohqsg
I have the pdf for the paper we did jn,btohqsg
Anything lower than 101 u are disowned,btohqsg
Calculation for how impurities increase boiling pt of a substance :(,btohqsg
But i guess john will enjoy it,btohqsg
Anyone want to play a quick game of Among Us,btohqsg
Nvm  I'll play with ransoms haha,btohqsg
how much is total marks for paper 1?,btohqsg
Can I say vertical axis no sub divisions,btohqsg
Share with me the pure chem one too once it's out,btohqsg
So they must estimate d values,btohqsg
It was easy whole of Singapore will do well,btohqsg
Doesnt matter cos no bell curve,btohqsg
I said that it doesnâ€™t start from 0,btohqsg
Did u finally figure it out bro lol,btohqsg
the paper was too easy cfm bellcurve high af,btohqsg
I once counted with 3 frens,btohqsg
I got 95 A1My fren 89 A2The 3rd one 85 A2,btohqsg
101% of people here need to take a class in statistics,btohqsg
Some ppl need to read newspapers,btohqsg
SG students only know how to listen to teachers fearmonger,btohqsg
Then ofc its abt like 93 percent ish,btohqsg
Grades are awarded based on cut off scores  which are not determined by a bell curve,btohqsg
Idk I only look at a1 ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So if 80% of singapore scores more than 95  and cut off for a1 in the past is 90/91  then the 80% will all get A1,btohqsg
Bruh shut up and study english,btohqsg
Keep in mind that over half of SG gets distinction for both maths subjects every year,btohqsg
Talk so much math wont improve also,btohqsg
And hence  a bell curve doesnt exist,btohqsg
A and E too I beleef,btohqsg
A bell curve minimises % of As  while increasing % passes,btohqsg
No bell curve but got grade threshold. Which can technically act like a bell curve since the grade threshold can be adjusted to determine the number of A1s,btohqsg
Yup but sadly it seems that bell curve wouldnâ€™t be disclosed for local papers,btohqsg
Can only find those international paper grade threshold,btohqsg
they dw disclose because they'll know people will find pattern recognition and apply in papers that'll lead to misconduct,btohqsg
this one my hist cher that said so who set and marked the papers before said so,btohqsg
But anyway international paper GT for A1 is usually just below 90%,btohqsg
The teacher who scanned it has ginormous balls,btohqsg
Iâ€™m guessing itâ€™s roughly the same case here so the A1 here should be in the Low 90s or high 80s,btohqsg
wait so e math easy to pass but hard to a1?,btohqsg
bro i alr did paper 1 and felt miserable,btohqsg
if cant get a1 then go for a2,btohqsg
I Guess you can say that but if no careless mistake A1 should be no problem,btohqsg
as of now i just want to pass lol,btohqsg
so is it easy to pass?,btohqsg
she say papers are made in such a way everyone can do one,btohqsg
It isnâ€™t hard to get at least A2 too,btohqsg
Only A1 slightly difficult in my opinion,btohqsg
So itâ€™s in fact less than half the marks,btohqsg
is this for e math or what,btohqsg
But o level osie econs in Sg uses the international paper,btohqsg
Iâ€™m guessing it shouldnâ€™t be much different here the GT,btohqsg
okay so it'll be easy for me to pass e math but hard to get distinction am i rigjt?,btohqsg
i flunk my paper 1  like 45/73 only,btohqsg
Itâ€™s by moderation this year not bellcurve,btohqsg
Check Cambridge website ^^ also on straits timeâ€™s,btohqsg
dont talk about bellcurve it'll stress you out,btohqsg
i can't study next paper knowing i may not pass math,btohqsg
want to rp also cannot go,btohqsg
Why u dowan share money with pat and xin,btohqsg
"DAE and req for ""okay ill retake paper while in poly""",btohqsg
because i want buy hersheys mcflurry,btohqsg
how about grade boundary? like easier to pass by harder for a1?,btohqsg
Almost all qns must be correct,btohqsg
Those students from top schs will be laughing their ass off heh,btohqsg
Theyâ€™re just as worried as all of you,btohqsg
Because all of you are overly kiasu,btohqsg
if i just want a c5? possible?,btohqsg
This kind of standard for paper 1  can pass,btohqsg
But idk how to say for paper 2,btohqsg
Paper 2 u can spot what questions already,btohqsg
what did yâ€™all get after comparing d answers,btohqsg
im not even from a top school but im worried cos EVERYONE seems to get all correct too,btohqsg
Guys 17b What if i correct to 3s.f.?,btohqsg
If not my A math how get b3 instead of c6,btohqsg
theres moderation if theres too many a1,btohqsg
Basically E math in short everyone is getting A1.,btohqsg
if its less than 25% A1 it might be jus 75 for a1 lor,btohqsg
Paper was quite easy compared to other years,btohqsg
E math need get somewhere close to very high 80 or 90+ for A1.,btohqsg
Basically paper 1 do well is the A1 ones that's what my teacher told me before!,btohqsg
so if paper 1 like cmi for anyone then can kiss bye to A1.,btohqsg
topics that may come out as big topics in paper 2- coordinate geometry- matrices- mensuration- congruence and similarity- circle properties- graph and functions,btohqsg
so if my math around 55% then i fail alr?,btohqsg
real world problems are the concepts we learnt,btohqsg
sometimes if they kind they put passing mark at 45-50?,btohqsg
prwc will not go off the syllabus,btohqsg
idt vectors will be a lot of marks in paper 2 tho,btohqsg
math impt theyll try to help u honestly,btohqsg
but if A1 they will make it harder,btohqsg
i did like my sec 3 el compre,btohqsg
my paper 1 i estimated 45/73  but i scared paper 2 i flunk. people keep saying paper 1 very easy then paper 2 die for sure,btohqsg
paper 2 is jus the stupid rwc thats disgusting,btohqsg
ofhers may be much more straightforward,btohqsg
dont forget to annotate for prwc,btohqsg
I mean emaths is considered simple if careful,btohqsg
And my emaths all along in sec sch was quite bad,btohqsg
topics that may come out as big topics in paper 2- coordinate geometry- matrices- mensuration- congruence and similarity- circle properties- trigo and bearings- sector and segments- inequality-,btohqsg
emath prwc demolishes my hopes for A1,btohqsg
the stupid polygon alr demolished half of my marbles,btohqsg
sector and segments are part of mensuration,btohqsg
topics that may come out as big topics in paper 2- coordinate geometry- matrices- mensuration- congruence and similarity- circle properties- trigo and bearings- inequalities- graphs and functions,btohqsg
there may be a quadratic eqn word problem,btohqsg
Go see the tys and the percentage of certain topics in both 1 and 2 then work from there to see if the topics will reappear,btohqsg
uh standard form they usually throw inside paper 1,btohqsg
this time standard form dh in p1 ah,btohqsg
They just call it something else. But for all purposes of understanding  it exists.,btohqsg
idk how to replace the words leh,btohqsg
try not to send here next time u gotta send study grp,btohqsg
bruh so if paper 1 was very easy then passing mark also get pulled along with distinction mark? so like to pass is 60?!,btohqsg
oh i replied at her eh,btohqsg
I fuck up the qns 3,btohqsg
same passing mark gonna be 60%,btohqsg
based off five years of my sec sch life teachers have been telling us that the papers we do will be hard to fail and hard to get A1,btohqsg
"and if you'd think you did ""badly"" for p1 just work a little hard for paper 2",btohqsg
Well this was what they did for o level in 2019 and before unless if you meant that this year onwards is special,btohqsg
bell curve is based on performance of students? then grade boundary is pre set along with the paper?,btohqsg
Relax go in try very hard and repeat the next day!,btohqsg
Guys the past is the past,btohqsg
No point u go bother liao,btohqsg
Later affect ur tmr el paper,btohqsg
don't wanna go back and forth about this just focus next paper,btohqsg
Why worry now in this chat the time spent thinking needs to be spent on the next paper,btohqsg
go prepare for the next paper no point being scared,btohqsg
Like I bomb my physics O level last year I also don't care,btohqsg
i really suggest you should stop worrying too much about it use the energy for tomorrow's paper,btohqsg
If not it may affect ur results,btohqsg
Confirm pass one fail means really never write anything logical at all.,btohqsg
look forward to your six months holiday guys,btohqsg
Means u never study or revise ah,btohqsg
Will do well one keep trying and don't lose any hope,btohqsg
U know and everyone else will know,btohqsg
Settle own self and revise the grades will settle themselves too,btohqsg
No one will blame if u put in 100 percent just try,btohqsg
Gl to all for england tmr,btohqsg
Some ppl rly need to learn to read,btohqsg
Zzz still argueing bout curve just let it go sua,btohqsg
Yes I know Grade threshold is technically not bell curve,btohqsg
Misleading people just for the sake of understanding?,btohqsg
Explain how my A math went from c6 to b3 then confirm got some magic inside it it is impossible for me,btohqsg
Every subject is only 25% A rate,btohqsg
But Iâ€™m pretty sure bell curve is helping a set number of people getting each different grades and since GT can be adjusted it indirectly also influences the number of people getting each grade,btohqsg
I'm serious  spreading untrue information for the sake of understanding? That sounds pretty ironic if you were to think about it.,btohqsg
National exams will have lower A rates,btohqsg
A bell curve also ensures an equal no of ppl fail the exam,btohqsg
And we dont see that happening,btohqsg
Just as how an equal no do very well,btohqsg
False hope is better than no hope when desperation kicks in :D,btohqsg
When you fling a paper away it will give some form of comfort and hope,btohqsg
hey is it you felt you did bad for a math then suddenly you get b3?,btohqsg
Considerin my exams now are graded on a bell curve,btohqsg
I can clearly see o/a lvls cfm is not bell curved,btohqsg
yes I got b3 for a math even when I fail one of the papers or borderline pass,btohqsg
There is only A math in O levels broski,btohqsg
as in how u know u fail one the papers/borderline,btohqsg
see answer sheet from tuition centres ah,btohqsg
No I never see I don't know how to do half of the paper,btohqsg
Don't need see also know see to get sadder for what haha,btohqsg
Bruh this year paper like so easy,btohqsg
Yes teehee wait for the next paper A math never have 1 paper easy one,btohqsg
I cry when i do a math,btohqsg
The first one I got very high and was like winning *dancing* then second,btohqsg
I both also cry idk how u dancing weh,btohqsg
wah i hope ur miracle happen to me  i just want a c6 lmao,btohqsg
Always be prepared for the killer paper somewhere in O levels,btohqsg
1 paper ez the other will be slightly harder,btohqsg
I tried every single part of the paper maybe method marks there,btohqsg
Depends lor u see they that year got mood or no mood,btohqsg
Mine got the mood for a killing of the entire cohort :),btohqsg
Cuase the 2019 one p1 and 2 not that scary for e math,btohqsg
why exchange the essays read the comments the teacher give bah,btohqsg
I can do now and send u,btohqsg
read other one doesn't mean the errors made can be corrected,btohqsg
don't go see how others write already go with the flow,btohqsg
Don't change writing style it is very risky for tomorrow.,btohqsg
If ur current one u can pass,btohqsg
Might as well pass than u risk,btohqsg
But tys ones can help with some ideas but dont take the style of writing,btohqsg
can share some tys model essays ðŸ¥º,btohqsg
To a small extent.Some of the argumentative and expository essays from the tys publisher I have aren't that great - lacking evidence to substantiate their point  points are narrow....,btohqsg
I mean this kind of things,btohqsg
Reading will only do so much,btohqsg
Do and ask teacher is the best thing u can do,btohqsg
But if u despo/never do ur work ah then this will help u alittle lor,btohqsg
I can only write argumentative essay well LOL,btohqsg
er i actually think reading would be the best way to score well yakno,btohqsg
Is not the best way to do this,btohqsg
Practice and getting constructive feed back is the best way,btohqsg
with reading you kind of gain experience... vicariously,btohqsg
Yea but reading u gain too many ways of writing,btohqsg
youâ€™re right in that you have to practice,btohqsg
but if you arenâ€™t well-read  you wouldnt be able to write either,btohqsg
when are your exams  by the way?,btohqsg
Then your purpose of reading is to learn one's writing style.,btohqsg
yes you do learn their style,btohqsg
I stick to my writing style but I read other's essay to gain more evidence and point of view.,btohqsg
But if u dont have a style u follow,btohqsg
U during exam wont be able to produce,btohqsg
ive never actually thought of it in terms of style,btohqsg
So wat i mean by reading is u read and get some ideas but u dont entirely take wat they write word for word,btohqsg
U urself need to have a way of writing,btohqsg
Means u need to practice to develop,btohqsg
Those are mainly novels and stories,btohqsg
Those wont be good for compo stule,btohqsg
I think@chemcermade it clear that he wants to gain one's insight of an issue.,btohqsg
sjkajkafshjkhsf son there are many really great essay books,btohqsg
you just gotta find the good ones fam!,btohqsg
when i read i mainly stick to them,btohqsg
i can rec you some good ones?,btohqsg
oh my god thatâ€™s really soon,btohqsg
good luck fam. ive never actually bothered much about styleâ€”one of my bigger concerns was the time crunch,btohqsg
Sleep then tmr wake up revise on some formats then its time xD,btohqsg
If that worked for u then thats fine,btohqsg
Lol i never memorise format yet,btohqsg
Everyone is diff in the way the learn and pick up,btohqsg
yeah i kinda gave up on style lmao,btohqsg
is it the english o levels,btohqsg
But letter format not much mark deducted lor,btohqsg
Idk but best to have it all,btohqsg
If math and science good but english c6,btohqsg
But u make sure ur 1LR4 or 5 dont overshoot ah,btohqsg
Today at moun sinai they make us,btohqsg
as in 64-66%? or 66/180 marks,btohqsg
I legit still looking for classroom 10min before,btohqsg
Then end up dk go where,btohqsg
Will be there on the door one,btohqsg
Pretty sure u ask the staff there they anyhow one,btohqsg
can i clarify that bellcurve/moderation/grade boundary usually only affects people who is striving for an A1 in that particular subject  however the passing grade is not affected even if the paper is very easy and many people get Bs and As?,btohqsg
How much is b3 for olevel math ?,btohqsg
some guy said last year he got 65% but got a c6 only  like this passing mark this year gonna be 75% :o,btohqsg
if you're talking about the guy who said that in here he's talking about paper 1 and paper 2,btohqsg
My motherâ€™s cousinâ€™s friendâ€™s daughter said that he got 99 but only B3,btohqsg
well  now i can just pray for seab god,btohqsg
idt the A2 grading is that high,btohqsg
can c6 be around 50? or 47,btohqsg
yeah they dont rlly change the passing grade,btohqsg
so c6 is like 50 max? usually. if lucky c6 can be slightly below 50,btohqsg
no guarantees but i think it is,btohqsg
