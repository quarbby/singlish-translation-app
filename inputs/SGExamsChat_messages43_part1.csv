i know like one guy above the age of 25 who wants to be an esports player,btohqsg
once ur pass a certain age these kind of things is rlly uncool,btohqsg

why would the school waste money on something like this,btohqsg
Schools not even gnna waste money on it lol,btohqsg
What kind of thing is really uncool?,btohqsg
I think living after the age of 1 is really uncool,btohqsg
You get to make uncool remarks about other people's livelihoods as being uncool,btohqsg
why is it that every time i'm on here there's people arguing,btohqsg
Irresponsible young adults are the ones who can't see esports is more or less like any other sport.If you can respect an athlete  you can respect an actual esports player.,btohqsg
Since there's a really pointless view that thinks that 'esports is bad lol muh taxes' - I thought it be appropriate to categorically state that is not the case,btohqsg
"imo it's not that esports is a problem. it's bc so many people unknowingly become addicted  it becomes a stereotype. and in the eyes of many adults  esports is therefore a ""bad influence"" simply because they don't game",btohqsg
nevermind u all wont get it,btohqsg
There are a lot of things which are 'bad influences' - you don't see them disappearing from Singapore,btohqsg
There's no point in ad homs,btohqsg
"there are certain things ""disappearing""  and in the case of esports it's really bc there's not enough exposure bc ppl keep shutting it down lol",btohqsg
my uni has an esports club tho,btohqsg
FWIW  I'm not very hyped over esports in SG,btohqsg
There isn't anything like FakeR or the like,btohqsg
How do they know if ur going out with another person u live with or not? And live with means  u cant be less than 1 m apart from even the neighbour staying opposite urs?,btohqsg
can understand why the gov want to place laws and fines,btohqsg
after all thats the only thing that works in sg,btohqsg
but i think its all placed in a rush then its also quite confusing and sometimes dont exactly make sense,btohqsg
Do anyone know where else can print stuff since library and printing shops are closed,btohqsg

./configuremakemake installCheck theconfig.logto debug further. Also check what your compiler tells you.,btohqsg
