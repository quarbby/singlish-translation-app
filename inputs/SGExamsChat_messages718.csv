Tech qns tend to be very hard actually,btohqsg
I just stopped forcing myself to interact w them,btohqsg
Cause need a lot of specific knowledge ?,btohqsg
And I think cambridge admitted that they male it harder on purpose,btohqsg
If i retake GP now maybe I‚Äôll get A with my lived experience üòé,btohqsg
My clique expanded to 7 in j2,btohqsg
I'm also not very happy that the clique got even bigger,btohqsg
And I can't vibe w the new person,btohqsg
Tho the toxic girl was inside but i just never talk to her but i dw lose the other 5,btohqsg
Like I feel the vibes rly off,btohqsg
I normally just do what i want,btohqsg
And shut them off when time is right,btohqsg
But it was basically just 1 problematic one la,btohqsg
Tho the rest some are not studying as much  they still understand,btohqsg
The person I rly rly vibe w in jc,btohqsg
Bro everyday i kinda dw go to class because of him but i also kinda want to go to class to see him,btohqsg
We met via this chat actly,btohqsg
Then end up both in tmüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
In jc i asked my cca mates more chem and qns than i asked my cher,btohqsg
I legit wanna tell yall some of our more lighthearted lores cause theyre funny,btohqsg
I vibed more with this guy in my cca and another person in the sister class,btohqsg
Coz my class only hv 1 other person that care abt grades  and 1 guy who is a genius,btohqsg
Rly understand how my social batt is like la,btohqsg
So they ok if I don't alw sit W them,btohqsg
I feel like my friends are the one that tolerated me  coz if im not studying  im a clown,btohqsg
last time we used to play amongus together alot,btohqsg
like it was the time when amogus was super popular,btohqsg
At least you got a clique that wanted to study,btohqsg
then one time he was the imposter and then i was a crewmate,btohqsg
The bulk of my class only studied after prelims,btohqsg
then he asked me not to tell other ppl playing with us then it was quite funny,btohqsg
Actually the whole hybrid cohort for my batch  the people who cares abt grades can be counted w fingers,btohqsg
And back then we had 11 classes,btohqsg
My class the top 3 (?),btohqsg
General sense of respecting eo lor,btohqsg
As in ur class top 3 out of the classes?,btohqsg
In my mind a whole class of sec school kids not wanting to study is worse than a whole class of jc kids not wanting to study,btohqsg
I mean the top 3 ppl in my class,btohqsg
u lose way more muscle than fat,btohqsg
I've tried it b4  it does not work,btohqsg
You are just breaking your body,btohqsg
I mean there's no like actual position or what but low-key just assumed we top 3üíÄ,btohqsg
Bro doing the h20 meal skipping practical paper,btohqsg
Real coz they will be more disruptive whereas jc no one cares if u dun give a shit in lectures,btohqsg
count ur blessings i want gain weight so badly,btohqsg
I think it is a good assumption,btohqsg
if they don‚Äôt care whether they lose fat or muscle it‚Äôs their call lol,btohqsg
my main issue is the drop in metabolism,btohqsg
No matter how they tryna sugar coat,btohqsg
Idk if it is the teacher making the difference but somehow my class made it top 3 for h2 econs in j2,btohqsg
goddam everything increases risk of death,btohqsg
i mean it‚Äôs not just fasting itself. there‚Äôs way too many misconceptions about nutrition,btohqsg
Ok cuz during the tdp briefing,btohqsg
like people that avoid all and any carbs,btohqsg
They keep saying why U get selected is cuz U got talent,btohqsg
I cant remember if it was promos or mbt,btohqsg
Oh wait yea it is promos,btohqsg
Why my level so many taking h2 econs bruh,btohqsg
how they even test ah without linking causation equal to correlation,btohqsg
Like stop tryna make it sound like it's beyond grades,btohqsg
i mean i wont lend to random,btohqsg
so you dont want your umbrella back??,btohqsg
i wanted to lend the umbrella because i wanted to get an excuse to talk to him,btohqsg
Idk if my memory lapse or what but i remembered they added me to the tdp grp suddenly before the briefing,btohqsg
must get each and every opportunity fr,btohqsg
dont become like the discord ppl,btohqsg
But ya la say real right,btohqsg
I rly hope I can pull,btohqsg
But it is also kinda stupid coz they dun kick ppl out if u do badly,btohqsg
LOL ya UK I got my first U,btohqsg
Im happy i hv no S and Us,btohqsg
I actly got S all the way for maths until promos one,btohqsg
My lowest is E for j1 mye and also E for gpüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
But now I urm must maintain my math god position,btohqsg
Wait i tot there was only 1 exam before promos,btohqsg
Timed assessment 1 timed assessment 2 mye prelims actual,btohqsg
Coz back then it doesnt make sense for j1 s to have test in march coz last time were all full papers,btohqsg
Tbh my mental health was damn bad,btohqsg
Ofc i did but different S and U,btohqsg
On the day of the test,btohqsg
I rly just didn't give any fuck,btohqsg
But actually tdp used promos right but promos percentile is q üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
i just finished revising my section of the research paper that‚Äôs getting published,btohqsg
I got D for h2 econs and it was 81 percentile,btohqsg
please peer review gods accept it,btohqsg
I just got more worried about my thurs intv,btohqsg
Is it the Alevel or Uni one? üòê,btohqsg
Basically there is an additional 30min test,btohqsg
They are gonna test for traces of gambling next,btohqsg
Remember that minister desmond: ‚Äòmust be a bad school‚Äô,btohqsg
But i have been against RI for ages,btohqsg
What are these hieroglyphs you are spewing fellowHomo Sapien?,btohqsg
I did not know that parliament is publicised,btohqsg
sista we have so much shit in common üòÆüòÆ,btohqsg
Just about sums up his stint in parliament,btohqsg
Damn he really went to the dark side  years of debates and politics did a toll on him,btohqsg
Oh yes now I rmb Desmond was the one that made hdb loose millions on 3 diff hdb projects for it's contractors,btohqsg
Speaking of RI there was once that ccs went to hci and brag about ri,btohqsg
And how did we get on the RI topic,btohqsg
Did you see the interview of ccs as a high school student?,btohqsg
Nah i dun care about pap,btohqsg
I wan you to call me sir or occiper,btohqsg
Lol how long ago was this,btohqsg
"""all good schools have one thing in common""..lets see what yall would say is that common thing",btohqsg
We can get you the numbers. But let me say this. What is the point behind the question? First  has local unemployment increased with all these efforts? The answer is a resounding 'no'. Our people are getting good jobs. Are our wages going up? Yes  and it's faster than many other countries. Those are proof points to show that we are doing right by Singaporeans.,btohqsg
Why u putting me on a chokehold,btohqsg
what kind of test? like acads kind or,btohqsg
I kind of stopped that now I just decided to eat all meals within an 8h window instead,btohqsg
But legit how yall know muscle gets burnt instead of fat though,btohqsg

Nvm this is what I saw onlineDo you always lose muscle mass when you lose weight?For the most part  yes ‚Äì weight loss is comprised of the loss of¬†both¬†fat and muscle  says Melissa  so this research shouldn‚Äôt deter you from continuing or trying to fast. It‚Äôs a matter of minimizing muscle loss  rather than avoiding it.space-lineWhat causes people to lose more muscle than fat?Food:¬†It‚Äôs not just about fasting. It‚Äôs about the quality and quantity of what we eat  says Melissa. ‚ÄúLack of protein is a huge culprit when it comes to muscle loss. The body doesn‚Äôt store protein the same way it stores other nutrients  so  we have to eat it regularly. We can‚Äôt expect fasting to do all the work  if what we do consume isn‚Äôt well-balanced.‚ÄùSome may struggle to fit in a healthy amount of protein if their fasting window is too strict; a more lenient  longer window to space your protein out may be helpful  explains Melissa. ‚ÄúAdditionally  how much protein you need is key to keep in mind. Protein is notoriously overdone. It should only account for around 15-25 percent of our daily caloric intake.‚ÄùExercise (or lack thereof):¬†A sedentary lifestyle can also lead to muscle loss  adds Melissa. Strength-training  in addition to aerobic activity  is key to maintaining and building muscle.,btohqsg

It is too long for me to read,btohqsg
i mean generally weight loss affects both fat and muscle so it comes down to body composition and diet. reshaping your body to keep or grow muscle while losing fat means you gotta also exercise/train and eat enough protein,btohqsg
but you also need carbs to keep metabolism up,btohqsg
Just the first paragraph would do,btohqsg
No need u ever heard of cocaine?,btohqsg
yo do u hv skincare routine,btohqsg
Tbh pxxxxxxx is the cause of my mental health deteriorating,btohqsg
1. My face is acne ridden2. I use wtv my mom buys and idrc about skincare,btohqsg
It is so bad the judgement is very real,btohqsg
I just feel painful going to class at this stage,btohqsg
Skin is the least of my concerns üò≠üíÄ,btohqsg
I feel my course is full of exclusive 90 rp toxic elites,btohqsg
so take a step back. are you more worried about the test or the interview rn?,btohqsg
My internship w xxxxx actually my worst experience  just me being ostracised by 1st class honours,btohqsg
yea but if you had to pick one,btohqsg
I would still say interview coz it is more of soft skills,btohqsg
Does it have an asterisks in the middle... asking as a BMS kid,btohqsg
ok then throw aside the test itself first and finish interview prep,btohqsg
U mean the name of the company?,btohqsg
And i did not put as many x as the number of characters lol,btohqsg
nope security guards that look like they are fit for the job,btohqsg
Wait which company has an * in the middle,btohqsg
There's a company with the exact same reputation in those amount of x,btohqsg
one of my relatives used to work for a security company..then he said that half the employees that were dispatched to school did not know how to use the radio,btohqsg
But im talking about my fellow intern grp,btohqsg
but the company not v *,btohqsg
That company said my senior was very good at cleaning out the rice cooker used to cook food for the flies.,btohqsg

Yes it is like 3/4 of the people?,btohqsg
@mersculawhy are u gaming in tele?,btohqsg
theres nth interesting in the gp essays i just marked,btohqsg
its more or less just people wanna take it,btohqsg
but geog is still the best,btohqsg
Then show it in the grades given,btohqsg
its cuz i can tell one whole essay (the 28/50 one) was chatGPT generated because of the examples,btohqsg
For example  coral reefs in the Caribbean have been experiencing significant degradation due to a combination of factors  including climate change  pollution  overfishing  and coastal development. As coral reefs decline  the loss of habitat and food sources has profound consequences for the diverse marine life that depends on these ecosystems  including parrotfish. Coral reefs support diverse ecosystems that provide food for parrotfish. Declines in coral cover result in reduced availability of algae and other food sources for parrotfish  leading to malnutrition and decreased fitness. These parrotfish may eventually die as it is not receiving enough food to survive. Furthermore  the parrotfish are preyed upon by various predators  including larger fish  sharks  and marine mammals. As coral reefs degrade and parrotfish populations decline  predation pressure may increase  further exacerbating population declines. The depletion of coral reefs meant that the parrotfish‚Äôs lives were endangered. This could eventually lead to extinction of coral reefs and parrotfish if this continues. Predators that prey on parrotfish may see a decrease in food sources and this affects the whole food chain  causing them to disappear one at a time. Another example is the golden toad (Incilius periglenes) and its specialised predator  the Monteverde harlequin frog. Both species were native to the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve in Costa Rica. The Monteverde harlequin frog relied on the golden toad as a primary food source  and its population dynamics were closely linked to the abundance of golden toads. With the extinction of the golden toad  the Monteverde harlequin frog lost its main prey species  leading to declines in its own population. The species are heavily dependent on one another  directly or indirectly,btohqsg
Wanted to beat the high score,btohqsg
i gave 16 for content cuz some parts were still like,btohqsg
and just cuz the example is chatgpt generated doesnt mean i can mark it wrong,btohqsg
its a full on nat geographic article abt,btohqsg
okay gd thing the student is not in here,btohqsg
okay tbf it used to be worse,btohqsg
last time she wrote a whole ass article on how polar bears are going extinct,btohqsg
and cuz i had fun lit exams in sec sch,btohqsg
Bud didn't even fucking try to arrange it neatly to make it look slightly more convincing,btohqsg
Is okie means I've got a chance,btohqsg
i gone back to plugging in gp essays into chatGPT,btohqsg
btw ChatGPT gave that essay a 42/50,btohqsg
In the end  what does that kinda imply LMAO lol the sch you come from eh maybe doesn't matter but ig at times like that it just seems debatable,btohqsg
ofc only one example but like knn,btohqsg
Idk if it's just me but tbvh it's kinda funny that they're in such schs in the first place üòÉ uh man fr press F for doubt,btohqsg
"pls lor i got RI student write for me before""Different arts got different meaning because different arts are different technically complex. Because different forms of arts have different levels of technically complex  they have different meaning.""",btohqsg
sch doesnt matter if ur student produces,btohqsg
what kind of content do you want in gp essays lol,btohqsg
chatgpt can do better then this,btohqsg
I‚Äôm actually concerned what if I legit ditch my coding mod and can‚Äôt even get D to S it  what if I grad with U,btohqsg
I actually wun mark ChatGPT work,btohqsg
I will throw back to the student,btohqsg
do you need to pass it to fulfil grad requirements,btohqsg
I dun think can grad with U right,btohqsg
There is a S there is a U so idk lol,btohqsg
It is very easy to tell ChatGPT work except if there is a right or wrong answer,btohqsg
it was written by a hci student,btohqsg
but i can tell its ChatGPT work,btohqsg
like itll be it can do these things such as XXX YYY ZZZ,btohqsg
ChatGPT did not exist back when I was in Jc,btohqsg
so u see like the combination of factors  including climate change  pollution  overfishing...,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt believe so fast things have changed,btohqsg
? Idt you get the pt,btohqsg
i do not give GP tuition,btohqsg
my english third language student managed to get a C for GP,btohqsg

""" the shit U write is shit""- Walter rand",btohqsg
Speaking of sugarcoating  some people can be very mean when not sugarcoating,btohqsg

I literally broke down and she said things that are really harsh and unreasonable,btohqsg
And putting words in my mouth,btohqsg
if im rly pissed off yes,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt really remember what I said,btohqsg
"I will go through ur HCI DRQ at a later date as it is very badly done. You seem to have forgotten how to do DRQ entirely.1.

Oh ya I heard being a PT moe cher?  is an unstable income because usu the Cher would uk not say laid off but more of being allocated to another sch ( eg you're teaching at tertiary and all of a sudden when that sch doesn't need u anymore you're gonna be  allocated to somewhere else where sec sch is a possible choice tooüíÄ ),btohqsg
That's what my GP PT Cher said or smth,btohqsg
Hopefully my productivity will go back up after my interview,btohqsg
I really get very distracted nowadays,btohqsg

Did she do ok in the end,btohqsg
My teachers were never pissed at me,btohqsg
Er like I had this section leader who hated me for all sort of reason,btohqsg
"Eh idk man normally when there's no sugarcoating...it's usually ""harsher"" which is sort of mean in its own way",btohqsg
Then I can‚Äôt really rmb but tension rose between us then someone helped us piece tgt and organise a meeting coz I was just complaining to her nonstop about this person,btohqsg
Like this kind of ppl is what I mean by making skills into a character issue,btohqsg
Ok let me now go back to force myself past this chapter coz tmr is a 100% interview day,btohqsg
i mean there's a line between being blunt and being an asshole,btohqsg
some people like to be assholes and say oh i'm just being blunt,btohqsg
Bruh even if I know my friends dun give a damn  I dun actually say these things,btohqsg
No it is not a point to say things out of nowhere,btohqsg
At least say things that are legit,btohqsg
She can claim I‚Äôm the weakest member and yet poor attitude,btohqsg
if they're attacking then it's not not sugarcoating alr,btohqsg
Bruh I was in exco and does she think I hv all the time in the world and must I tell her specifically when I going to practice,btohqsg
Is it lol I find it's a very thin line for some,btohqsg
It's prob subjective at this pt,btohqsg
She has given me enough troubles when I was doing my exco duties,btohqsg
it's very clear cut to me lol,btohqsg
I mean yea when u put it that way,btohqsg
She is really making skills issue into a character issue bruh,btohqsg
i mean some people can't take it when someone is being blunt,btohqsg
and be like wow you're an asshole,btohqsg
blunt vs asshole  taking criticism vs being a doormat for insults,btohqsg
see what side you wanna be on,btohqsg
Popular sells IP schools test papers?,btohqsg
Make a guess which course she is in,btohqsg
Why you being such a naughty boy boy,btohqsg
I know you love being in the limelight,btohqsg
If I know I‚Äôm wrong  there is nothing wrong about someone being blunt‚Ä¶if it is something I know it is not me and u are saying it as if I have poor attitude and what not‚Ä¶you are just throwing hate for the sake of it and deny things,btohqsg
then my question becomes why do you care yk,btohqsg
If only you'd act that wayüòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆ,btohqsg
or more precisely  why should you care,btohqsg
It is coz it was in front of the whole section and tbh I got pissed and out of mind,btohqsg
yea but that's the thing lor,btohqsg
Maybe idk leh if ppl want u to hear their insults   they're tryna make u take it personally so y not try take it constructively,btohqsg
you can know you're right without having to prove it or be upset when others don't think so,btohqsg
Tbh she and another senior was giving me a whole lot of problems when dealing with my exco duties,btohqsg
I was the QM + Treasurer and they made me bomb budget by getting the conductor to get us to buy something,btohqsg
ok fuck this i'm going back to bowling,btohqsg
And worst is I needed to settle it within 1 week coz of deadline,btohqsg
I got into an argument with my own section mates,btohqsg
uni not the place to stress over this sort of thing,btohqsg
That's what you wish you'd say if you were indeed an NPC,btohqsg
an NPC wouldn't even say that themselves,btohqsg
Coz the same 2 people insisted that this particular song was not percussion heavy enough,btohqsg
so are you sure you're an NPC,btohqsg
And not to mention peak NPC?,btohqsg
Then there was a war between me and them and I just felt awkward,btohqsg
And my whole exco hated that 2 ppl,btohqsg
It depends ah‚Ä¶but just a warning that most of them are of very high caliber in terms of skill,btohqsg
uni cca just do smth fun and cool,btohqsg
A lot of people from snr and external co,btohqsg
i took care of cats for one of my co curriculars,btohqsg
A true NPC ain't even self aware theyre npc,btohqsg
And if u get shit cca mates like this 2,btohqsg
She even turned defensive when I told her my point of unhappiness,btohqsg
also having responsibilities for ccas in uni is tiring lol,btohqsg
Hit right on the nail nig,btohqsg
And was like ‚Äòok if u say we did that  then sorry‚Äô,btohqsg
don't expect apologies from people that don't matter,btohqsg
But there were just this 2 idiots that make exco life difficult for me,btohqsg

and i fell into the rabbit hole of stimulus to fatigue ratio  perfect form and 1g/lb of body weight of protein,btohqsg
Can someone enlighten me  how come a lot of h2 math stuff I see in the other group I dun actually remember doing lol,btohqsg
change in syllabus/school style of asking questions that's maybe a bit extra/you grinded so much last time but the actual familiarity of concepts wasn't there so after few years forget alr,btohqsg
oh if memory serves u teach a lot of tuition right,btohqsg
How to link phone number to multiple accounts actually,btohqsg
So they actually use 2 phone numbers?,btohqsg
meanwhile mine was 995 for 1k a month,btohqsg
9-5 is like 8h but u need subtract 1 lunch hour so thats 7h,btohqsg
the train is most crowded reaching city area at 9,btohqsg
at least based on my very limited and small sample size taken at various times from 850-910,btohqsg
no lah where got so bad,btohqsg
any 1 know how to say cut ties with someone in chinese?,btohqsg

Bruh that's just called a sweat shop,btohqsg
I got paid 2 shillings and 9 guineas for my 24 hours shift todayOH BOY!I get to splurge and sleep in a 2 shilling coffin today,btohqsg
aye chinese email is how many words ah,btohqsg
Right now I'm doing a 965 intern,btohqsg
i think i bombed my interview,btohqsg
Aight ill pray they accepted me since not alot ppl signed up,btohqsg
Because i saw the AS curve,btohqsg
I think I'm going to SNAPS,btohqsg
Same that is why im in an econs mod,btohqsg
But it is v different fr jc,btohqsg
I thought uni econs mostly is like maths based,btohqsg
compared to jc econs which is YAPPING,btohqsg
But for whatever reason the subjects where I like the classes the most  I did the most badly for them during As,btohqsg
Now I guess you don‚Äôt like uni Econs?,btohqsg
It is not that i dun like  the math is just hard to remember,btohqsg
(not because of econ so yeahh),btohqsg
And they dun make it as clear as in jc notes,btohqsg
Is it cos they just expect yall to be independent,btohqsg
I miss all classes except gp and chinese,btohqsg
As in do more self study,btohqsg
Any stuff that‚Äôs not clear to you they expect you to look it up yourself,btohqsg
One talks like telling story  the other talks like a bullet train,btohqsg
I hope those aren‚Äôt the same profs teaching Econs in chs,btohqsg
I thought siyan sent the pic with direct entry majors and common entry majors,btohqsg
No wait econs is in chs what,btohqsg
No reason for it to be different,btohqsg
I just made my nail defect worst,btohqsg
This one was since December sia still there,btohqsg
Coz I accidentally let the hotel room door (which is damn heavy) slam on my thumb,btohqsg
And retarded in removing my thumb,btohqsg
Just have to hope it regrows quickly,btohqsg
Idk if it will be gone as i cut my nails,btohqsg
I thought it would grow up,btohqsg
And yes coz i dk what i was doing  i just made the hole bigger lol,btohqsg
So basically after a few months it should be gone,btohqsg
I didnt know nails take forever to grow,btohqsg
But finally i see it nearing the top,btohqsg
If you lose a whole nail it should be fully regrown in under a year,btohqsg
Wait that looks like a beer,btohqsg
I should stop peeling it  let worst got infection,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt peel  use a nail file,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt have then best to leave it alone,btohqsg
Wait how does telegram allow these stickers,btohqsg
U planning to go chs econs?,btohqsg
And w more minors on telegram these days,btohqsg
I guess so. But I didn‚Äôt specify the major in my application,btohqsg
I‚Äôm thinking of putting Econs as my first major and polsci second but I can also change,btohqsg
Might want to try history or geog,btohqsg
In the past you had to?,btohqsg
Oh you mean if I mix Econs and polsci,btohqsg
Then it might be somewhat similar,btohqsg
My Econs Cher was like ppe in Singapore is just for flexing only lol,btohqsg
We just following what the prestigious unis in UK do like Oxford by creating a similar course,btohqsg
My econs cher told me she can see i hv passion in econs snd can consider uni econs lol,btohqsg
I definitely have passion for Econs but I‚Äôm scared that once I see all the math I‚Äôll hate it,btohqsg
Hmmm yea the math can be a pain,btohqsg
Also I‚Äôm still thinking about whether to retake Econs this year or next,btohqsg
It seems that for some reason this year‚Äôs paper besides me some other ppl who normally do well for econs got a worse grade than expected for As,btohqsg
Then some ppl online who retook econs said their grade fell compared to 2022,btohqsg
I guess it‚Äôs just unlucky I happened to sit for this year‚Äôs paper cos sometimes it‚Äôs possible that for some particular questions you write stuff that Cambridge examiners don‚Äôt want even if normally most other stuff you can hit it,btohqsg
i mean... its not difficult to buy a new sim card and create a new telegram account just to lurk here  to see what marks@Randkmdkdgives his students,btohqsg
I dun actually think it got to do w the papers coz they cant let the whole cohort w/o As or things like that,btohqsg
I also don‚Äôt know but like my guess it could be the person  like if they were to sit for some years of papers they would have done much better than another,btohqsg
It is actually not worth retaking it if u had done decently well,btohqsg
Cos some years they may ask questions where the person may write stuff which the Cambridge examiner is not looking for,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs just unlucky they ask a certain kind of topic or what,btohqsg
Then it is a skills issues that u dunno what Cambridge wants,btohqsg
So someone who sat for it in 2022 could have done better than this year,btohqsg
Yeah but then besides me I have seen others who got 80-100 percentile in internal exams get B or C for As,btohqsg
But tbh wun ur school prep u for what cambridge wants,btohqsg
What is so abnormal about it? Such things do happen,btohqsg
It was more than usual at least for my sch,btohqsg
That is why chers have been saying do not rest on ur laurels even though u scored well for internal exams,btohqsg
Shit happens once in a while but not at such a large rate,btohqsg
If you see me answering questions in the other chat you would know I definitely know my stuff,btohqsg
Sometimes besides skill can also be other issues like time management,btohqsg
I think that could be one of the bigger factors for me,btohqsg
I did not write fast enough,btohqsg
Then never finished questions in both csq and essays,btohqsg
My econs cher told me that cambridge marks point form,btohqsg
Say must write in proper sentences and paragraphs,btohqsg
My cher was like ‚Äòu cant do this in school papers but cambridge marks point form‚Äô,btohqsg
Why they don‚Äôt want to tell me that,btohqsg
I mean it is prolly true coz i got an A w one whole essay of point form,btohqsg
If I retake I guess I should try your strategy,btohqsg
Coz i was running out of time,btohqsg
Csq did you write everything in point form?,btohqsg
No only the last essay coz i was writing everything properly until i know i was running out of time,btohqsg
Did your Cher say if in essays Cambridge is obsessed about diagrams,btohqsg
Mine did but another Cher in my sch said no need draw everytime,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs like I hear conflicting info from diff sources,btohqsg
Maybe when I retaking I don‚Äôt use point form but I use more broken English such that I can cut down on the amount of words I write,btohqsg
It's actually more normal than u think,btohqsg
I feel econs has insane fluctuations,btohqsg
At least in top JCs thats what I've observed,btohqsg
Hmm okay  but I guess for my sch I can say that in 2023 there were more such students than in 2022,btohqsg
Anyway since Cambridge doesn‚Äôt release our marks for each component unlike IB  it‚Äôs hard for students to self diagnose what went wrong during As,btohqsg
wtf. How is a 60 hour work week even legal,btohqsg
I thought by then would be considered overtime and they‚Äôd have to pay more,btohqsg
