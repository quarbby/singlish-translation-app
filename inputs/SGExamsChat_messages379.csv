i accidentally walked into sajc once,btohqsg
eh which jc nearest to you,btohqsg
it's more like  you take into account other's views but still make the decision yourself,btohqsg
cos i was at potong pasir park connekter,btohqsg
haha actually we barely hear stories or news from them also,btohqsg
And my fav tcher is gnna be vice principal,btohqsg
my school culture is go eat ban mian,btohqsg
what do yall think is most impt factor to consider when picking a jc then?,btohqsg
it is absolutely pointless to try and gauge a school's culture because you won't know how you yourself will experience it,btohqsg
wah im glad i made the choice without knowing at all at p6 sia,btohqsg
how late you can wake up without being late,btohqsg
i late like 20-30 times throughout my 4 yrs in sec sch....,btohqsg
and how far from your sec sch do you stay...,btohqsg
1 of my friend also got an internship at the national dental centre or sth then her supervisor didn't dare to say much because the supervisor's boss was friend with the girl's dad,btohqsg
ok that one happens to many people,btohqsg
Im always late  but im frens with my class chair  so she always mark me present üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
i used to reach sch one hour before flag raising,btohqsg
Then i go coffee shop buy carrot cake for her,btohqsg
not that far lol  like 20-30 mins away,btohqsg
If u get to skip assembly,btohqsg
i never understand how they have so much things to say sia,btohqsg
assembly 1-2 times a week wah,btohqsg
my school must tap card attendance in,btohqsg
my DM like to give poems,btohqsg
but after awhile no one checks the system,btohqsg
i heard uni scan qrcode for attendance or smth,btohqsg
bruh the number of times i've skipped class in my 4 years of uni,btohqsg
Legit no proffs gives a flying shit if u are there a not,btohqsg
the only way profs can get you to come to class,btohqsg
is if attendance is like 10% of your grade,btohqsg
i saw acjc got demerit point system sia.... and if u late 3 times  1 demerit point,btohqsg
U can appear half an hr b4 a 4hr class ends,btohqsg
u kena 12 demerit points kicked out of sch iirc,btohqsg
not just them  i heard tj also have,btohqsg
wah shit i cfm get detention if i got tj or ac,btohqsg
u make her sound like this pepe emoji,btohqsg
Bedok needs a dream unit now ah,btohqsg

Lol idk whats the score line these days,btohqsg
but i havent thought about what poly courses to go to,btohqsg
im not planning to go to yijc,btohqsg
feel like it's a blessing and a curse that i never went through this headache lol,btohqsg
yea  but not sure if i'd do it again,btohqsg
Infact i didnt even do JAE,btohqsg
ye cos someone forgot the deadline,btohqsg
glad i didn't take O's sia,btohqsg
would have messed up O's geo,btohqsg
my ip geo was easier than O's geo,btohqsg
That was some good trolling i did to myself,btohqsg
right after PSLE is very early to just decide i wanna do A levels lol,btohqsg
then if i fuck up A levels,btohqsg
then i only got one PSLE cert,btohqsg
i chose it because my cher told me to then i only found out what jc was about at sec4,btohqsg
U dont hv to think things thru too srsly until jc,btohqsg
ya sia wah that thing also,btohqsg
Coz if u think now its no use,btohqsg
"at the back of my head  i knew that even if i mess up at sec4  the school will try to bump me up because they wanna show the parents ""IP 100% promotion rate""",btohqsg
U dont hv the necessary information to make informed decisions yet,btohqsg
Lol seeing people putting my school as the backup choice like what I did last year üíÄ,btohqsg
Sleep at 4am like the rest of us,btohqsg
eh i was about to tag you sia,btohqsg
that's why there is a market failure for the jc education market,btohqsg
Eh guys e8 for English straight go ite?,btohqsg
But ur sources will be very very limited,btohqsg
lol not except me la   quite sure a handful of us also,btohqsg
So ur efforts is likely to be spread very thin across many possible paths,btohqsg
Which means u not going in depth into anyth,btohqsg
even though ik poly also got pressure but,btohqsg
aiya i bet at pri school you also think o level damn scary,btohqsg
I thought people are underestimated mpb üíÄ,btohqsg
coz all my sch tchrs said,btohqsg
Really help me grow alot while hving alot of fun,btohqsg
eh don't listen or at least dont be affected too badly. At p6  i wanted to dsa to nus high then i didn't because i was told my pri school was shit so i thought my grades were fake,btohqsg
if they had to go thru another period of time (like go thru pri sch/ sec sch/jc/uni) they all say they dw to ever go thru jc again,btohqsg
only 2 of us out of who knows how many j2 here,btohqsg
Bruh my only complain for jc is 2 yrs too short,btohqsg
didnt u say youre gonna sleep,btohqsg
I wish i can trade 2 yrs secondary school to 2 yr jc,btohqsg
Roomie still doing work cannot sleep,btohqsg
I think it depends and is different from one another,btohqsg
some of my tchrs also say,btohqsg
I mean I survived through my j1 this year with pretty decent results without tuition hehe,btohqsg
All the way till As LOL,btohqsg
Some people have a lot of tuition and still die,btohqsg
i got so much tuition sia wtfk,btohqsg
I focused more on CCAs and interest groups,btohqsg
Some people have flying grades after they go to tuition,btohqsg
And some remain the same after everyday of private tuition,btohqsg
For me I have a neutral pov,btohqsg
If I have a choice I would go to tuition I guess so you don't need to spend too many effort on your own,btohqsg
If u need help then go get it,btohqsg
But tbf I don't have any tuition and I'm still ok after 1 year here  touch wood for next year,btohqsg
But i feel its enuf to consult ur chers and do extra papers on sgexams,btohqsg
Wait til you get useless teachers and have to do everything on your own,btohqsg
But ofc emphasize on studies too much ah,btohqsg
Find out who u are and what u like,btohqsg
Coz u wont hv a better time,btohqsg
For guys at least hv ns,btohqsg
School for holding pens not for holding hands,btohqsg
i remember telling my gp cher that 1 of the purpose of jc was that and he straight up said no üíÄ,btohqsg
the other hand hold hands secretly under the LT tables,btohqsg
that feel when you go nlb and see couples hold hands do papers together,btohqsg
I don't even have time for myself I don't know how people dating,btohqsg
Its only in uni that im,btohqsg
Go find ur own love story,btohqsg
