But like sushi it always depends on where u get it from.,btohqsg
oh yeah that toosince it's raw seafood,btohqsg
like fast foodcan eat but don't eat too much,btohqsg
Well then you would have to define what is a right amount especially for relatively innoculous and ubiquitous consumables,btohqsg
Btw I can go back to formal English rite?,btohqsg
Great just indulge me while i engaged in the floccinaucinihilipilificacious use of the English Language for it is iniquitous to deny a person with such a fundamental right of speech and as an extent one of a right of passage.,btohqsg
potassium cyanide that a lot of people used to suicide,btohqsg
For example one would have to consume a rather large amount of water for it to be lethal to the biology of a human body,btohqsg
common knowledge that apple seeds are poisonous  although only if you bite and swallow it then it would be an issueif you don't bite it but just swallow it it'll just be passed as waste,btohqsg
man my moms always saying that i drink wayyyy too much water for my bodylike i literally chucked 700ml of water after jogging when i reach home every weekend,btohqsg
Actually there is a cool trick one could do. If u actually open up apple seeds and smell the core of said seed  it would smell similar to almonds similar to the smell of almond paste or the concoction used in Almond desserts,btohqsg
‚Äúwater bucket‚Äù new nickname for me,btohqsg
oh nois it laced with cyanide,btohqsg
Well pure hydrogen cyanide doesn't its mainly cuz of the benzyldehye that provides such a smell,btohqsg
Na I recently attended a concert and like all Singaporeans do  I had to queue for a very wide array of events  but basically I bought a 1.5L bottle of water afterwards and took it down in one glup,btohqsg
now almonds all of a sudden sounds so dangerouseven though my parents told me that they were beneficial for health if i ate them,btohqsg
wonder what he‚Äôs typing ü§îwhy so long,btohqsg
You have to be very careful as to telling people that cyanide smells like almonds. As mostly could also only associate it with sweet almonds which have little to no cyanide content  hence I only gave an indicative product which I think closely mimics that smell.. it is honestly a very chemical smell either ways,btohqsg
because i literally remember that eva braun killed herself by biting on potassium cyanideand when people went to the room where she and hitler died they said her body spelled of almonds,btohqsg
bitter almonds like what you said,btohqsg
It is similar to how when you where told as a Secondary 1 kid how Aqeous Ammonia would smell like hear rotten eggs etc but then when one actually inhales it it very much is a chemically smell that overpowers everything,btohqsg
Well Hitler didn't have that distinction because he was so paranoid as to getting captured that he bit on the ampoule and shot himself in the head simultaneously,btohqsg
oh and also apparently he didn't trust the cyanide capsule so he literally tested it on blondi,btohqsg
Yes he did.. to be fair I don't understand why he wanted to test if cyanide works after all he already tried it on 7 million jews,btohqsg
after killing so many people he's still not sure if it works,btohqsg
"As Joseph Stalin Once said ""A single death is a tragedy  A million deaths in a statistic.""",btohqsg
