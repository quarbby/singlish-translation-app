YTD  my trading fees including FX is 0.017588849%,btohqsg
Gfy I guess I don't even do S&P500 so ðŸ¤·,btohqsg
oh I don't just mean like sp500 but just trading fees,btohqsg
U included the funds expense ratio?,btohqsg
nah that's just my tx fees,btohqsg
fund expense ratio is the same no matter what platform I use mah,btohqsg
Yeah I prefer the liquidity volume and ratio,btohqsg
Don't give a shit about fees at all,btohqsg
made of money built different fr,btohqsg
But doesn't matter if it's high liquidity,btohqsg
I got on syfe trade for the free money and fucked right off,btohqsg
meh u do u I guess. with ibkr I get the freedom to buy wtv I want wherever I want all at extremely competitive prices. ibkr is the market maker  u can't get anything better anywhere else,btohqsg
no middle man to take more fees,btohqsg
HAHA u do know they earn their money from elsewhere,btohqsg
ya but since it doesn't rly matter to u then,btohqsg
Which is why just get those with high liquidity can liao they can take that 0.0001 bid ask spread,btohqsg
I mean I cld but 15% withholding tax difference v high,btohqsg
U also never factor expense ratio,btohqsg
At the end of the day,btohqsg
anw voo spread is 7Â¢  0.014%,btohqsg
VUAA 0.07%  VOO 0.03%  0.04% diff makes much less diff than 15% withholding difference  plus VUAA is accumulation,btohqsg
so I don't get your point,btohqsg
Webull charges a 50 cent fee for every transaction then 5 cents gst  is that high,btohqsg
Every year some assets that is in the fund is sold off to pay the ETF provider and custodian,btohqsg
I don't invest in S&P500 so outside of that the fees are significantly different,btohqsg
So that would be reflected in the value of the ETF itself I guess?,btohqsg
Yeah in the AUM - Assets Under Management,btohqsg
Which would then reflect on the pricing of the etf itself,btohqsg
Like basically if VOO had 0% expenses instead of 0.03% it wouldâ€™ve been 0.03% higher every year,btohqsg
Lower liquidity also increases an ETFs likely of tracking error,btohqsg
but webull still fucks you on other stuff,btohqsg
but meh unless you active trade doesn't rly matter,btohqsg
Yeah basically end of the day negligible,btohqsg
HAHA I mean if we talking about tx fees then it's q a flat comparison I guess,btohqsg
Gg I guess I have to educate myself on more of these terms,btohqsg
They provide one month commission free trading but after that the honeymoon is over,btohqsg
It works for me because I don't invest in the S&P500,btohqsg
So the volume is nonexistent for the alternatives I have,btohqsg
Singapore needs to practise safe driving fr,btohqsg
Annoying sia the same calls again,btohqsg
Is why SG urban planners designed most of our roads to have hard shoulders,btohqsg
SG drivers are just shit in general,btohqsg
