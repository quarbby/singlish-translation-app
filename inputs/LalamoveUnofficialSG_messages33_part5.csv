When there is growth in the economy the Govt definitely wants a piece of the pie,btohqsg
Last month i went to abs leasing they say in April  NV200 got rebate $20k bcos it's using petrol. Only for those using diesel must pay extra $10k for the diesel tax.,btohqsg
B4 implementing that  they raise up the petrol price already. So clever,btohqsg
Jus like playing dai deeThey tend to lay out 2 spade first b4 the final card,btohqsg
Just wait till all erp gantry turn back on.. price will surely go up.,btohqsg
After 10mins Livechat cs let them know will put a remark,btohqsg

Problem is u can handle or not,btohqsg
I donâ€™t see a problem with that ðŸ˜‚ I doing lalamove with my partner so Iâ€™m tempted by this suggestion,btohqsg
But how to register 2 acc to one car,btohqsg
Cannot  u need another veh no.,btohqsg
makes more sense if u get one car and one motor account... two car accounts parked at the same spot just going to see the same available jobs... its no different from just one account  since u only have the one car.,btohqsg
Where can ask abt whyq application? I applied and no sound no picture from them,btohqsg
You do more their orders from llm  and wait for their invitation.,btohqsg
Hi  can i ask if Nissan NV200 isit counted as 1.7m Van?,btohqsg
Hi guys can any experienced driver share with me isit easy to earn $200 a day with car on lalamove?,btohqsg
Change new app become lesser job,btohqsg
Can but youâ€™ll be driving 10-12hours a day,btohqsg
On average for me per 5 jobs i take i earn abt $70+   i work from 1030 to 5pm including abt one hour rest for lunch,btohqsg
Average i aim > $15 per trip,btohqsg
I think if u take one week as a guide per day 150-200 for car is possible,btohqsg
Cuz i mainly do Meal hours n Weekend full day minus off 3 rest day i average out $162/day. And feb still have 3 more days to go haha,btohqsg
But i only started last year Oct so i am pretty new too. Mayb the more experienced user have tips to earn more ðŸ˜‚ u never know,btohqsg
I have reduced my driving days only for Thurs to Sat 11 to 9pm. Weekdays prices and car orders are just too low to justify for the car cost. Other days I work with F&B or Home-biz for route deliveries. Less dramatic than LLM and save petrol. I dont do LLM MPV jobs anymore - too heavy and too much time needed.,btohqsg
True that. After deduct fuel don't really earn $200 unless super lucky,btohqsg
Mpv job mainly take wat item?,btohqsg
If driving car you need to be a grab driver to do grabexpress,btohqsg
A lot of saikang  basically van job but customer dowan pay for vanEg. Delivery between fastfood outlets - frozen chicken  stacks of cold pizza dough  need manpower and timePersonal deliveries could be bicycle or small furniture,btohqsg
I suppose 2.4 requires helper1.7 can solo,btohqsg
I do foodpanda then LLM during weekend lunch time.,btohqsg
Do u guys know where i can source for delivery helper or walker,btohqsg
If using car.. outside of llm will you all suggest to do panda or grab?,btohqsg
Haha I got grab drivers tell me if not full time  donâ€™t commit grab cause grabfood run a lot on incentive.,btohqsg
