it‚Äôs proof of competence not proof of knowledge,btohqsg
So that employers know if u were to task to learn a new field of knowledge  u can do it within a certain time,btohqsg
Hearsay the reason why we learn high level maths in uni for STEM course is to make sure they are nt dumb,btohqsg
U dont want doctors that cant solve calcus to do operation on patients,btohqsg
All stem need those skills leh  I can‚Äôt think of any which don‚Äôt,btohqsg
It does get abstracted away at work by a calculator or program of some sort or even excel inherited from the past  but you need to be aware it exists and can re-learn to verify,btohqsg
Coz maths itself is a way to test your logical skills,btohqsg
i mean different areas of math would translate to different fields well,btohqsg
like even if i majored in biology there‚Äôll be specific industries or fields in it that use math,btohqsg
Even if u take psychology u also need statics  which is another field of maths,btohqsg
Funnily enough math is my worst subject after mandarin  so nowadays I just use computers to find math answers lol,btohqsg
ok a big chunk of psychology is actually statistics not just needing it,btohqsg
I use mathematica until i hit a problem that can‚Äôt be solved by it,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt quantum computing right now basically all math anyway,btohqsg
There isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúreal one‚Äù which can hold more than like 50 classical bits,btohqsg
hmm depends on the area you‚Äôre looking at since it‚Äôs so new  meaning different people are working on different aspects,btohqsg
As in a actual logic gate with quantum circuits that can compute an acceptable answer from given inputs  there isn‚Äôt one which has enough qbits which are equivalent to 50 real bits,btohqsg
Oh my bad I just googled it,btohqsg
yea that‚Äôs the largest one rn,btohqsg
Been like 6 years since I read the Wikipedia article about it,btohqsg
we are still super far off from getting anything commercially useful yea,btohqsg
I think im the only dumbass that dk how to use wolfram,btohqsg
I tried to plug in the question and it just give me ans,btohqsg
esp since our goal is not to just emulate classical computers but get some sort of quantum supremacy,btohqsg
the math heavy part is rlly in the form of the algorithms and complexity theory,btohqsg
I think you‚Äôre opening Pandora‚Äôs box with all the quantum stuff  stop factoring prime numbers so fast otherwise we no more secrets T_T,btohqsg
the less math heavy (but still heavy since it‚Äôs physics) is figuring out how to optimise the architecture in the first place,btohqsg
like experiments and theories are made on more optimal ways to arrange or connect the qubits,btohqsg
new kinda of qubits and their dynamics,btohqsg
lmao i‚Äôve read this too many times,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the most interesting fact about quantum computing you know right now,btohqsg
hmm idk about most interesting like quantum computers are still at infancy,btohqsg
but i like that we are at the stage where quantum simulators can almost fully mimic several aspects of chemistry,btohqsg
and personally  the issue of noise and decoherence is so big that if we managed to find an optimal path of dealing with it  we will probably see new Moores law for qubits,btohqsg
Now rch limit rdy no meh,btohqsg
i‚Äôm talking about a new kind for qubits,btohqsg
Implies upper bound to qbit based computers right?,btohqsg
yea so big areas now are- algorithms that are more qubit efficient (optimally making use of what we have)- methods of noise reduction- error correction to mitigate the effects of the noise- new types of qubits that are more noise resistant and last longer- architectures that can lose coherence at a slower rate,btohqsg
right now IBM uses superconducting qubits so they are fast but their issue is as they scale up  their architecture has to be quite specific since they can dephase quickly,btohqsg
i‚Äôm working on semiconducting qubits that aren‚Äôt as fast and relies on short range interactions (which sucks when you‚Äôre trying to stop them from interfering with each other)  but they‚Äôd last longer,btohqsg
I got only half of that but it sounds super cool  are you using the IBM quantum computer simulator? How can you test your theories?,btohqsg

Actually now more common to work then go back study or study part time local uni,btohqsg
Mostly is financial independence doing the talking that's why,btohqsg
Otherwise you will need to take loan to directly go study full-time,btohqsg
u guys know theres a 50% off frappes in buckies,btohqsg
Those who know what they are thinking are aware that the degree likely won't translate to work. But then they will also be aware the system in place is no degree = hard-stucked fast. So just get the paper  use it as a last opportunity to do non-work stuff  then move on,btohqsg
There's even work study deg now,btohqsg
I tagged u on the ecg channel üëÄ,btohqsg
i know people that do it,btohqsg
