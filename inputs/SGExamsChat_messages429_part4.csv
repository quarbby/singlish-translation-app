Guys is it true  that you can't enter a local uni if you get a F9/E8 for MTL at O levels,btohqsg
ive read the requirements for some uni's all require a D7 or above,btohqsg
so yea you need at least a D7 at o levels for MTL to get in a local uni,btohqsg
if not you have to retake mtl courses,btohqsg
no just asking if its valid information,btohqsg
my bro keeps on insisting you dont even need to pass mtl to get into a local uni,btohqsg
Because he is in express and is gonna drop the whole subject,btohqsg
no like he wants to F9 MTL,btohqsg
"then what does the ""D7"" requirement refer to?",btohqsg
i thought the green requiremnet is for jc,btohqsg
the red requirement is for o levels...so its for ppl who go poly route?,btohqsg
Red requirement is literally for higher MTL,btohqsg
so he is fine being a express student right now and just completely dropping mtl as a subject?,btohqsg
he does not even want clb,btohqsg
and he could still go uni?,btohqsg
You cant drop MT as a subject,btohqsg
No matter how bad you are,btohqsg
His route is after o levels...he gonna go poly,btohqsg
He dont want to pass it and he tells me i can go uni,btohqsg
that is what im trying to correct here,btohqsg
But cant be that bad until clb cannot pass bah...,btohqsg
No like he is the type...ask write compo  will hand in 1 word type,btohqsg
Like i have friends whose chinese is so dogshit but they still can pass clb one,btohqsg
"^he says he can...so i just told him....""Worse come to worse  you gonna retake MTL as a subject after 3 years of basically not learning abt it""",btohqsg
since he alr have his sights set on poly,btohqsg
my bro is literally getting B3's on all the other 4 core subjects,btohqsg
Im not sure about poly to uni need to pass mtl or not but,btohqsg
just chinese right now is E8,btohqsg
Its not hard to pass clb...,btohqsg
