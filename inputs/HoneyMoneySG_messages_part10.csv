I mean shops like redwhite on shopee/q10,btohqsg
My iPhone 12 was around 300 cheaper from these 3rd party sellers.,btohqsg
Yup. I'll put up some reputable shop links when their iphone 13 is on sale. I only recommend those that I have tested and verified authentic,btohqsg
Hmm ü§î if let say I trade my iPhone XR 128GB for this iPhone 11 128GB is it worth it ?,btohqsg
Not much diff from 10 to 11.12 or 13 will be much better,btohqsg
Anyway  each sequential successor of iPhone usually adds around $200-$300. But it comes with 1 more year of system updates  better chip  better camera  smaller notch (maybe?). That's about it. So you have to weigh your own cost vs benefit to see if it makes sense,btohqsg
i jumped fro mthe first gen iphone X to iphone 12 pro max.,btohqsg
shocked at the speed and tech specs of iphone 12 pro max lol,btohqsg
used my iphone x for 3 years  thinking that the tech development wont be much  but 3 years worth of development is quite a big jump haha.,btohqsg
Also maybe share what phone are you currently using!Mine is a 2nd hand Samsung S10+,btohqsg
Was using a brand new Samsung A51 last year and it's poor. For the same price +$100 to get a faster chip and better specs S10+ is a no brainer,btohqsg
Wanted to try the Samsung flip but seeing the review not worth my invest of the new phone to use,btohqsg
Suprised no one here 12 months or lesser (yet),btohqsg
On the iPhone topic  is it necessary to get Apple care? If yes  where to get it at a cheaper price,btohqsg
Not an apple iphone user here. But since I don't extend warranty on other brands  i dont see the value in it,btohqsg
Hi  Does top up grabpay or shopee pay using citibank credit card also consider spending?,btohqsg
No but you could use Amex true cashback or Uob absolute amex  both eligible,btohqsg
Sry but even if a spending is not eligible for cashback for that certain card  would it still be counted in the spending pool? Especially for those cards with minimum spending per month üôèüèΩ,btohqsg
Not all.Like dbs yes but uob no,btohqsg
Maybank used to be yes but now tnc says no  so i didn't try anymore,btohqsg
How about paying for season parking or telcobill? I tried read the T&C  not very clearing stated.,btohqsg
Season parking and telco bill can use grabpay mastercard,btohqsg
Shopee offers AppleCare at 15% off:https://shopee.sg/product/442800909/12801910348?smtt=0.201275614-1632635124.9,btohqsg
Can instarem link with Gemini Mastercard ?,btohqsg
Not sure as I don't have the card,btohqsg
haha btw can link the Instarem card with revolut card?,btohqsg
Maybe but why would you do that when you can link with Citi Rewards  DBS WWMC for 4mpd and FnF for 8%?,btohqsg
With the instarem card   exclusion will become included since it will be just categorise as online transaction?,btohqsg
Negative. The underlying card tncs still remain. E.g. whatever that earns rewards point on citi rewards will still earn  but those excluded will still not earn. It's just an intermediary,btohqsg
Hi everyone. Any opinions on whether to do individual stock picking on tiger or have a portfolio full of ETFs on syfe? New investor that prefers stability,btohqsg
"I've been a syfe user for about 2 months + now. Really quite confused about their advertising saying what ""15% growth for equity 100"" and ""4-7%"" for retis. But in reality both portfoilios made 0 gains and significant losses for retis.Take note that im not an influencer who receive referral bonus unlike the people which syfe advertises on their social media",btohqsg
if you are not familiar with a sector  e.g. healthcare but wish to invest in it as it is considered quite a defensive sector  u can consider the syfe that also includes ARKG for them to do the job for you. As it may be too technical for general layman   too much effort for research and theres knowledge gap. However  if for particular stocks that u are have some knowledge and done your due diligence   risk to rewards  u may invest directly using tiger to buy the individual stocks. Syfe can be like the foundation   as it buys into etfs. While u stock pick and buy individual stocks on your own .,btohqsg
"Meanwhile for tiger  it always seems that I'm very sway that after buying a stock  it goes downhill. Seems like I'm ""buying high and selling low"" instead. Not supposed to be like this? Not trying to time the market but  perhaps Im more suited for etf?",btohqsg
Yes. For a new Investor that prefers 10-15% growth  one time lump sum instead of DCA  has a rather diverisifed portfoilio  not sure why both syfe and tiger all losses. Is not like I'm day trading or buying penny stocks. Is all established stocks like appl  fb  tsmc  Nike. Everything red,btohqsg
Yes me too. For me  I took up the cash+ portfolio.To me it seems like those money market funds wtih low lying interest and stable. However  it was not. 2 days gain was shown as $0.12 while after another 3 days showing as -$3,btohqsg
if you are holding for long term  short term market volatility and market correction should not affect you too much . Instead  each month when u have additional new cashflow  u can DCA in.,btohqsg
"üòÇüòÇ I gave up on syfe cash+ alr. It says ""1.5% projected returns"". Not sure how true.I recently started my own custom portfoilios on syfe. Because there are components within equity 100 that I don't like- ex: kraneshares china. I don't want any China etfs for now",btohqsg
Hmm but syfe helps you to buy small proportions (like 0.02  0.03) of the etf whenever there are gains? So is like the gains are reinvested?,btohqsg
"if u look at the ""transactions""  u can see the dividends received  bought and sold by syfe from time to time",btohqsg
Actually I'm Kenna losing faith in investing. Cos ex: if u buy apple on tiger for 148.. then it goes up to 154... Huh? $6 can barely buy 1 meal of cai fan. What's the point? üòÇüòÇ All these speculation  affect mental well being negatively.Then ok if raises to 154  then after last Monday crash to 143. All gains of the past 2 months + wipe in 1 day. What's the point ah?,btohqsg
Focus on the business  and fundamentals  not so much on the price. The price is a reflection of investors confidence.  If you have done enough research and due diligence on a company  you should be confident that in long run it will move up eventually . Need to have conviction before investing into a company  if not will end up buying high  selling low,btohqsg
Syfe charges 0.65%. so that's like 5$ for the first 10K invested every month.. but I mean if I can get 10-20% growth I won't mind paying 0.65%. but now is mostly all portfoilios negative... Disappointed,btohqsg
The issue with index ETF is... If I get on tiger... Means I need to hold it for as long as possible. Because if I sell  is sell the entire thing. Whereas if I get index ETF on syfe.. I can choose to transfer out any % of it anytime. So is more flexible? But syfe charges 0.65% every month unlike tiger+ Syfe doesn't even have all the index ETF. Only VTI  RSP I think... Quite limited,btohqsg
Yup. I did a small amt of research through Motley fool. So I got things like Nvidia  tsmc  apple  AMD  FB P&G  Starbucks  JnJ. A good mix of tech  big moat companies  dividend stocks.  So far mostly all red on tiger. Awful.Is not like I'm choosing meme stocks like amc mah. üòÇNot sure why everything Kenna red.,btohqsg
tiger needs to buy 1 unit .  Syfe  when u withdraw  they sell off fraction units of diff etfs.,btohqsg
Recently market isnt doing too well in general . Market will eventually recover again... i hope haha,btohqsg
All these are great businesses so should be good to hold.Don't lose faith so fast yet.When i started investing (SG stocks). It took 3 years for me to just breakeven,btohqsg
Etf via ibkr  vwra buy and hold if you want stable but not spectacular results,btohqsg
if not use syfe  haha robo advisors serve to eliminate emotions in investing.  So just need to do a fixed monthly recurring amount into the portfolio .,btohqsg
Doing this for me and my partner joint acct,btohqsg
