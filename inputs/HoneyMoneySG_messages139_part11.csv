The 365 cc to get the cashback can I only spend $800 on dining then get $80 cash back.,btohqsg
Or must spend with petrol or other category to accumulate that $800 to entitled for the $80 cashback?,btohqsg
For the UOB one account   if I use the money lock  the bonus interest will not affected right?,btohqsg
Probably they found out that not much savings accounts that offer higher rates than them  even if HSBC EGA have high rates  they only give the interest near to 2 month after cycle ends,btohqsg
Can only spending on dining. But how to get $80 cashback?Dining is 5% cashback so if u spend $800 solely on dining  u only get 40$ cashback.Also be sure to check that the dining MCC u are patronising is coded 5812. 5813 (bars) and 5814 (fast food) are NOT eligible for 5% cashback  only 0.25%. Some you may think is not fast food (eg. Sushi express) but is coded as 5814  so be very sure to check,btohqsg
I think you meant 5812  5813 and 5814,btohqsg
Yea haha my bad  Monday blues arh give chance pls,btohqsg
Seeking the power of internet  does anyone know how to negotiate with the restaurant owner that we want to pay for a banquet using credit card instead of pay now? He mentioned there’s bank charges of 5% if we were to use credit card and not sure how true is that… hope anyone with a kind heart could help enlighten me 🥹,btohqsg
Yes cc have charges which merchant can chose either to absorb or not,btohqsg
It's true that vendors have to pay a transaction fee for credit card payments. Officially  they cannot claw back these charges from the customer  but it is perfectly within their right not to accept credit card payments. Unfortunately  there is nothing you can do but depend on the goodwill of the vendor.,btohqsg
Hello  I would like to ask a question regarding REIT.I bought 400 units of Fraser back in 2023 at 2.35  but it was diluted to 2.12 in today's price. I still only have 400 units even though the price is diluted. Does it mean I automatically lose 2.35-2.12 per unit from this dilution?The dilution usually happens when they want to raise money and buy new properties  but why my part of the share will take the lost from the purchase of new properties?,btohqsg
hello  uob prvi & dbs vantage good cards to sign for miles bonus? i have wedding banquet to pay for so min spend of 4k for each card should not be a problem.just wanna check if the rewards are worth,btohqsg
I will recommend DBS Vantage if you can spend about $60k per annum since the AF is high ($599.50) and it is generally not easy to waive unless you hit the spend of $60k. First year is not free and the AF needs to be paid.You do get some nice benefits for the Vantage like Accor Plus membership (Free 1 hotel night stay) with 10 PP uses.Otherwise  go PriviMiles.Incidentally both cards are mainly used for iPayMy and CardUp. If you use those facilities  both cards are awesome.Edit: if you are new to either bank  consider DBS Women’s card or UOB PPV or UOB VS. Those are 4mpd cards which are more attractive vs 1.5mpd (Vantage) and 1.4mpd (Privi),btohqsg
Probably to make it consistent with the existing marathon promo.All bonus interest credited by 20th of next month.Last time scb was messy. They paid the bonus (only incremental amount) at the start of next month then the shortfall by 20th.,btohqsg
Yes based on principal amount. But u also collected the reit distribution for the period too.,btohqsg

Shares get diluted when reits do equity fund raising to purchase new assets by issuing new shares. But if the purchase is dpu and NAV accrediting  you will be better off in the longer term.,btohqsg
You are the boss. You are giving the restaurant business. You tell the owner that either they absorb or you take your money to another place. the owner should be afraid of you. Not you afraid of the owner,btohqsg
CC 5% is high. Are you able to pay by Citi payall? Otherwise look for other places if you have time,btohqsg
the % paid by merchant in credit card  is how bank fund the miles and cash back.,btohqsg
I don't think hotel restaurants or non hotel restaurants are the main issue. The main issue is our dear bro still showed a sad emoji in his message. He has money and is in full control.The restaurant owner should be in this chat group asking how should I convince my customer to pay 5% cc fee 😭,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGmay I know who did u engage for your defect checker ? And do you have any referral code for it ?,btohqsg

Hi gurus  did Maybank fnf consider 5499 as dining ?,btohqsg

Hello all  some questions regarding CPF RSTU. If I have already hit FRS  will topping up to my CPF SA still entitle me for tax savings?,btohqsg
You mean your CPF SA already hit FRS? If you already hit FRS can't top-up RSTU.,btohqsg
Yes  for example  cpf already having 210K,btohqsg
So is youtrip better than bigpay?,btohqsg
If your CPF MA haven't hit BHS  you still have tax relief opportunities from there. Else maybe can look into SRS.,btohqsg
What do you want to do?,btohqsg
Trying to figure out which of this 2 is better for spending currency at other countries..,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/o8o_oSn9YPwRecent video by Chris. Didn't include big pay but other popular options are there.,btohqsg
Hmm.. because I was looking purely at sign up bonus from Moneysmart.DBS / UOB PPV / VS does not have not any sign up bonus as of now.,btohqsg
Dbs vantage has sign up bonus from dbs itself. 60k miles iirc.,btohqsg
Yeah  so would it be worth to actually sign the cards  pay AF & meet the min requirement? Following year just cancel after 1 year? 🤣,btohqsg
Can. Remember to clear all ur pts before canceling.,btohqsg
Thanks  because my thinking would be to sign up multiple cards for sign up bonuses (myself and partner) for banquet payment.This is to rake up miles to enjoy a good honeymoon afterwards  would this strategy be advisable? Of course monitoring and tracking would be necessary.,btohqsg
Or if there are any cards strategy for wedding payment please kindly share with me! 😅,btohqsg
