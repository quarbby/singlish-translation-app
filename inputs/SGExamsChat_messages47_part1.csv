cuz if no need video call i gna apply for jobs,btohqsg
can someone lie to me that it isnt?,btohqsg
hi anyone has a solution for this,btohqsg
How else would you do it,btohqsg
Mysql should be quite easy to learn,btohqsg
Do u have knowledge about relational databases?,btohqsg
U need to learn the theory well first,btohqsg
gcd(A1 ... AN) = gcd(A1  gcd(A2 ... AN)),btohqsg
The language should be quite easy,btohqsg
yeah but they want sum of the gcds of all possible sequences,btohqsg
and generating all possible sequences is o(k^n) which takes way too long,btohqsg
AAAAAH I SAID LIE TO ME YA CUNT,btohqsg
the sequence doesn't matter right? no matter how you arrange the array the gcd will be the same,btohqsg
you just need to do a modulo exponentiation mod 10^9 + 7,btohqsg
gcd(A1 ... AN)^k mod 10^9 + 7,btohqsg
ehh each element of the sequence ranges from 1-k,btohqsg
I didn’t say it was or wasn’t,btohqsg
you calculate and store the gcd of the subsequences then just keep adding up,btohqsg
but wont that be O(NK) cos u need to decide each element individually,btohqsg
what kind of time complexity do you need to hit,btohqsg
n root k? k root n?,btohqsg
tbh i'm not strong at dp  i can only recognise this would be a dp problem  the rest if left to you to hit xd,btohqsg
ya left my dp problem blank in my finals,btohqsg
but yeah O(NK) would be tough to hit 2 seconds too,btohqsg
O(NK) at N = 2 * 10^5 and K at 2 * 10^5 = 2 * 10^10 which would be like.... 200 seconds,btohqsg
ehh more like 10 cos atcoder judge is fast,btohqsg
Your complexity must be < n root k?,btohqsg
n root k should pass cos 100k root(100k) is about 34mil,btohqsg
What a mess of a problem,btohqsg
Has there been new regulation recently about masks?,btohqsg
actually since a lot of the permutations will involve a 1 inside  is it possible to exploit the fact that gcd(1  x) = 1?,btohqsg
You need masks to go to supermarket now,btohqsg
But you are not fined for not having masks,btohqsg
u need to wear masks on all public transport  malls/shopping centres and marketshttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-all-commuters-have-to-wear-masks-on-public-transport-says-khaw-boon-wanhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/coronavirus-all-shoppers-must-wear-masks-in-supermarkets-and-malls-or-be-denied-entryhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/wearing-a-mask-compulsory-at-40-markets-from-april-12-police-called-in-more-than-20-cases,btohqsg
My dad kept telling me I would get fined for going downstairs without a mask,btohqsg
not fined but u will not be allowed entry,btohqsg
POFMA is sure doing its job well,btohqsg
I don’t understand the purpose of people who spread chain messages,btohqsg
huh i tot its true sia,btohqsg
The same people who spread the gospel,btohqsg
Okay that's a much more valuable response kek,btohqsg
tbf  the direct consequence of believing this chain message is arguably positive for society,btohqsg
but one must question and seek the truth as an intellectual in sgexams telegram,btohqsg
Here we promote only the most intellectual of discussions,btohqsg
I thought we identified as degenerates,btohqsg
that title belongs to the sgexam discord comrades,btohqsg
Including the discussion of John's identity,btohqsg
we fight for the same cause but we use different means,btohqsg
We work in the dark  to serve the light,btohqsg
wait a second  aren't you that guy who was anti PAP,btohqsg
