Is there any UOB promotion now? Savings and credit card,btohqsg
If you are existing uob credit card holder  it is within 24 hours.,btohqsg
I applied on non working day(Sunday night)  hence it is less than 24 hours. I believe if you applied during office hour  should be less than 1 hour. Other can comment?,btohqsg

specifically kris+ app needs to link to google pay which the krisflyer CC cant. Seem stupid so not sure why cant.if you're referring to the kris shop then using the CC can help you clock that $800/yr kris ecosystem spend and also count as 3miles/$,btohqsg
Hi gurus the ocbc titanium+ amaze for MCC 5944 can? Or what's the best way to get miles or cash back when spending big overseas? Tyvm,btohqsg
So long as you keep within the whitelisted MCCs and be mindful of your spending limit of S$13 335 per membership year. Looking at your card's expiry month will allow you to know which month your membership starts. Otherwise  it's very straight forward earning 10X OCBC$.,btohqsg
This is for the ocbc titanium. 5944 is not inside meaning no 10x points?,btohqsg
Some ppl online says have but must keep within the $13 335,btohqsg
https://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/cards/tnc-titaniumrewards-creditcard-programme-wef-1mar23.pdfdont have to use amaze  theirs is based on whitelisted merchant codes. local or overseas also can,btohqsg
MCC 5944 - Clock  Jewelry  Watch and Silverware Stores is excluded. Do use your best earning general spending card instead. You can pair this card to Amaze if it's a MC issued card.,btohqsg
you should double check with OCBC directly since you have the MCC code  they can tell you directly.Also the most ideal is $12 500 spend/yr if you want to convert to miles. As OCBC points have to hit a certain block to convert,btohqsg
Ahh I see. Okay will give them a call. Cos wanna buy some big ticket item overseas. And wanna get the best of both worlds.,btohqsg
can i check! for the hsbc ega promo  can i transfer out the money for ocbc's interest  then transfer back for hsbc's one?,btohqsg
Hi  need some advice. Does uob interest based on any specific cycle for the high interest rate  like May to Jul or Jun to Aug  etc?,btohqsg
no it can be achieved monthly,btohqsg
Hello  anybody using XNAP with hsbc revo? Confirm got 4mpd?,btohqsg
Thanks bro. But how do u know XNAP transactions are eligible since hsbc doesn‚Äôt break down the points? Or is there an alternative way to check?,btohqsg
nope  is only salary or GIRO and $500 spend,btohqsg
you can but it does not give u the incremental for HSBC everyday+ 1% if u withdraw and deposit on the same month,btohqsg
The answer is that you don't know.  I find it hard to reconcile points from HSBC on my own. I previously called into HSBC CSO to get the MCCs for all respective months' transactions. All XNAP transactions of mine fell under 5814 - Fast Food Restaurants  which earns 9X HSBC$. I kind of gave up calling in already since my HSBC RV card is used primarily for my XNAP  groceries and F&B transactions.,btohqsg
and also provided the credit/debit card spends are not in the exclusion list.,btohqsg
Government COL payment of $200-$400 has just been credited into our paynow-registered bank account.Criteria: must be age 21 and above  own 0 or 1 property  assessable income $100k or less,btohqsg
Ah I see. Thanks for elaborating!,btohqsg
maybe depends on bank just checked mine don't have,btohqsg
i think only for those with OCBC as the crediting bank receive so far,btohqsg
i see!! thanks for the reply bro!,btohqsg

Matter of time willl be none,btohqsg

Hi I have a IG CFD account. I did not log in for many years. I was shock that they deducted $25 a month from 2019 for inactivity fees.What can i do about it?,btohqsg
Just ask cso there. And check whether they do have this fee beforehand. This type of qn is too niche for ppl to answer.,btohqsg
For citiplus  its hold the $15k for 6 mths. not 4 mths,btohqsg
Deposit by the end of 2nd month + hold for 4 months,btohqsg
so the p.a. interest calculation is wrong,btohqsg

Switching from GOMO to Zero1. Would like to ask if anyone knows how is the port-in process like?I had paid the subscription fee for this month (Jun) for GOMO. If I were to apply for Zero1 this month  will the subscription fee be refunded (GOMO charged on pro-rate basis)?,btohqsg
You completed your 5x transfers + 2k credit at the start of the month of May?,btohqsg
Pls share your experience after switching. GOMO is also not my cup of tea,btohqsg
Yes  by right shd be abt 4%?,btohqsg
It should be 1% annual interest of the difference of ADB of Apr and May  subject to a cap of $300.,btohqsg
