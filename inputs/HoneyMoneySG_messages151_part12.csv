Hi!! Using Standard Chartered CC here  currently shows 2 diff amounts on my StanChart App. Due amount & Total Outstanding balance. Which one should I be paying off first.Due amount is also higher than Total Outstanding balance.,btohqsg
Need to pay due amount. Did you have refund?,btohqsg
I converted one of a large payment to instalment after the statement have been reflected if this info helps.,btohqsg
Kinda confused with different advice here😅,btohqsg
The difference between the 2 amounts is the refunded amount from the converted transaction right?,btohqsg
And the total outstanding balance is lesser right? As stated in your original message.,btohqsg
Now it's clear that you have to pay the outstanding and not the full statement ya?,btohqsg
The card I'm using is stanchart Journey. I recently also hit the bonus spend categories  3mpd but the points doesn't reflect it. May I know usually ho long does it take for the bonus spend rewards points are credited?,btohqsg

Does anyone know what waitlist on Eva air means? How come have to pay taxes to be on waitlist Eva air?,btohqsg
Similar to Krisflyer waitlist but for EVA you need to pay taxes first.,btohqsg
Do they refund you the taxes if waitlist didn’t go through?,btohqsg
From what I read online:‘You're issued a ticket for the waitlist  points deducted  taxes paid.If you cancel / refund before the flight (whether or not waitlist is confirmed)  you need to pay $50 refund fee for the points and taxes refund.If you don't cancel (even if you are NOT confirmed a seat by departure)  you can use the ticket for up to a year from booking  but it has to be the same departure/destination.’My advice is do not put yourself on the waitlist.,btohqsg
… gg Okok thank you so much!,btohqsg
Hi 👋.  Found this group from YouTube. If it's not too much trouble I have a question 1) I am a Singaporean living overseas2) I still have some bills in Singapore. Was thinking to apply for a credit card but am obviously not eligible as I don't have income in Singapore3) I will go the 10k fixed deposit route. I found 3 banks that offer thisHsbc dbs and uobDo you guys recommend any credit cards for the above banks? I am mostly overseas and still have some bills in SingaporeThank you again,btohqsg
got try apply card and got rejected?,btohqsg
I gave a call to DBS and they said they can't approve as I have no CPF contribution history,btohqsg
I was thinking a travel card. I.e HSBC T1 or DBS altitude. Since I am overseas  I can earn more MPD on spends here on top of bills in Singapore.,btohqsg
Where do you live actually? Their banks may have better offers for the locals.,btohqsg
Qatar. I have full bank services here but I am at the mercy of fluctuating exchange rates when I pay bills in Singapore. On top of that  the card doesn't work for some services in Singapore.1) was thinking to consolidate all sg bills to one card. And just pay the card monthly,btohqsg
