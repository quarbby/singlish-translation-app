Hi all! Anyone have heard of this  ‘Just get to know that Singaporean not daring enough to boycott foodpanda. Go see Malaysian boycott food panda cause of the new scheme last year I think. Also  have heard panda office in Thailand got bombed! Maybe it is time for Singapore to also boycott and stop using foodpanda too!’? Any view or comments?,btohqsg
But y? Such a convenient platform. Boycotting would b a slap on our own faces unless there r certain concrete reasons.,btohqsg
Well  like the system is unfair or not right  cos have heard that tips given by customer through the app when making order will be added onto the job amount given to those making the delivery and not separated. That means  the tips is calculated as income which is not right cos tips are actually meant as a token not income.,btohqsg
It’s not about don’t like or like.. shall one still continue to invest in a particular stock or share if it is being use to fund for the wrong reason or bad things although it is giving the investor good profits?..,btohqsg
Anyway  I’m just asking for view.. no right or wrong.. it’s up to individual.. thanks for sharing..✌️😅,btohqsg
Maybe I might have a little bit too much curry.. 😅Anyone know the answer to this  ‘which is to kXll first between snake and Indian?’.. hahaha.. actually  all race is the same.. like they say don’t trust Singh but most Singh got appointed as ‘jaga’(care taker)  like in charge or to provide security..So.. ya.. it’s just really only a saying.. ✌️🙏,btohqsg
Ya. Figures r getting scarier by the day. Anyway....Good Morning all  Hav a good weekend n b safe.,btohqsg

Chill chill. Dun let this covid thingy spoilt our weekend. As it is now  very chiaklat already but life must still go on. Food must b on table to feed family. Food must b there to fill your stomach. There shouldn't b any more lockdowns  only probably tighter restrictions. If lockdown  economy will go down the drain.With high vaccination rates  we r ok. Like I said earlier...from positive to negative will only take ard 3 to 4 days. Deaths r in cases where victim got underlaying illness.,btohqsg
See all those die are 70 above,btohqsg
Ya. Ya  the most headache ones is this. 60 n above n not vaccinated. Dun know y gomen dun wan to make it mandatory for ppl to b vaccinated.,btohqsg
They say it’s against human rights,btohqsg
But when we were babies we had so many mandatory vaccines isn’t it?,btohqsg
Life is really tough now for everyone  especially those whom kids are in current psle exams now,btohqsg
