But don't all 3 science work together??,btohqsg
nah we're all dreamingwe aren real either,btohqsg
It's just being separated into 3 major science groups,btohqsg
im gg to study chemistry now bye,btohqsg
bro yall fighting over physics chem and bio,btohqsg
i got 44/100 for chem then dropped chem,btohqsg
what if they were anime characters...,btohqsg
Aiya let’s just agree it’s Chem>Bio>Phy and move in,btohqsg
"the word ""power"" is also in physics",btohqsg
sketch the three sciences fighting each other as if they were actual characters,btohqsg
Everything in Chem starts from understanding the atom,btohqsg
wait no must add in maths also,btohqsg
Understanding the atom  comes from Physics,btohqsg
maths ill do jt next time,btohqsg
Who discovered the electron? It was JJ Thompson  a physicist.,btohqsg
Who discovered proton  and nucleus  and etc. It all started with Rutherford alpha particle scattering experimentThat's physics,btohqsg
Chemistry? Study of the electrons and protons and nucleus and reactions? It comes after.,btohqsg
guys dont argue w jun wei alr! y'll cannot win an argument w him,btohqsg
Aiya just accept the scis r all intertwined tbh,btohqsg
All sciences are birth from physics,btohqsg
some are more intertwined than others,btohqsg
physics is the mother of chem and bio,btohqsg
i am the mother of physics,btohqsg
maths is the foundation for all,btohqsg
yes so dont argue w jun wei,btohqsg
he can win y'll in an argument,btohqsg
phy = applied mathchem = applied phybio = applied chem,btohqsg
that what I learn from a friend,btohqsg
math is the more important subject,btohqsg
Newton needed to solve some physics with maths that didn't exist yet.So he invented calculus.,btohqsg
without math u can't do phy,btohqsg
Newton had a ton of new things,btohqsg
he dun call it as calculus ntw,btohqsg
Wasn't even a debate. It's only facts.,btohqsg
leibniz was the one who was the one who publish calculus first.,btohqsg
and he called it as calculus,btohqsg
Newton had the power and backing,btohqsg
Same I invented another form of imaginary math,btohqsg
So you will be the next Newton,btohqsg
but its not useful for modern day physics,btohqsg
only newton will understand for now,btohqsg
How about1 + 1 = 11andx + x = x²,btohqsg
this is why math is hard. cos you all messing thing up,btohqsg
math is the language of science,btohqsg
We are simply discovering advanced maths,btohqsg
1+1=1 is the math of the future,btohqsg
Imagine society if 77 plus 33 was 100,btohqsg
Do you know according to math calculations,btohqsg
A fall from 9m 3 stories means you wont die,btohqsg
Remember the guy who believed in his physics,btohqsg
