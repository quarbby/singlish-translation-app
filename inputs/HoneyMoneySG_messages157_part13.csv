It‚Äôs not about signing up. I am intending to spend a certain budget on credit card monthly as long it can give me good rewards.,btohqsg
Fingers crossed ü§ûüèª CC bill payments are coming real soon,btohqsg
Anyone able to pay for insurance with chocolate card? Mine is coming due and idw to top up just to not be able to pay for it,btohqsg
If on 31 Mar for some reason you withdraw until MAB increase is dropped below $500 then you will lose this month's save bonus.,btohqsg
Hope OCBC 360 is not your primary bank account for interest since you seem to have a lot of movements and you have below 75k. Else is going to be a meagre 2.65% p.a. EIR.,btohqsg
When people stop withdrawing  then probably will return. Now they have to sell the fund holdings before transferring the money.,btohqsg
3 to 6 business days  the earliest I give also Thursday or Friday.,btohqsg
As long not through AXS and up to $250 per transaction (there is dp that shows $250 also cannot  $249 can).,btohqsg
I believe you registered via SMS ¬†in Feb  5+ weeks ago. Search SMS 74722 (the day you sent) or HSBC-Retail (the day you received notification). Yesterday SMS from HSBCSG is just a reminder to increase your fund in March so that you can get 2.9%.,btohqsg
4 miles per dollar. U earn 4 miles per $1 u spend,btohqsg
But your query is on signing up rewards. Most importantly if you have specific spending then as correctly pointed out  you need to get specific cards for the specific type of spending unless you are willing to go for cards with less rewards but points which doesn't expire.,btohqsg
Hello all  anyone knows any way to earn miles while paying for singtel bills? I thought of use CRMC in singtel app but then saw that it is AXSpayment. Paying like that won't earn miles correct?,btohqsg
If i link grab pay later with citi rewards cc will i still earn the bonus points?,btohqsg
No. Grab PayLater is same as Grab Top-up,btohqsg
Should I still use chocolate finance when overseas? Is it still capped at 1k spend?üò¨,btohqsg
still cap at 1k. Depends on what other options you have. Still a decent option but id prioritize my crmc + aamze,btohqsg
No fate already. Withdrawing now .,btohqsg
Thanks a lot! Yea I will use amaze crmc and if exceed will use chocolate.,btohqsg
Think It's going to collapse soon,btohqsg
It‚Äôs always a good reminder no matter what chocolate finance says before  its not a bank and you are not putting deposit there. Withdraw your money if you dont trust it.,btohqsg
Have end of next week to receive it ü§£,btohqsg
actually if they are serious about salvaging their reputation they should just dangle 5% interest guaranteed (and they will top it up if it falls short) and limit axs payments,btohqsg
This might actually look desperate and cause more people to lose confidence,btohqsg
this was a PR disaster and exposed the weakness of the company business model,btohqsg
üòÖ. That is 2% above 3% base rate.For 100 millions of deposit  that will increase the cost by 2 millions.,btohqsg
AbsolutelyEveryone should invest/deposit with full knowledge what they are getting into.They are a licensed fund management company. Not a licensed bank.,btohqsg
you go a lot of banks  the AUM is key lei,btohqsg
Hi  can i ask  does UOB Preferred Platinum  the dining portion  includes Mcdonald app and some restaurant that can use QR code to order & pay on the website,btohqsg
i pay directly on the insurance website tho. asking because saw previously that people were unable to pay with their chocolate card too  transaction declined,btohqsg
should work. i recall most in app payments at dining places will e under 5812 or 5814 or 5734.,btohqsg
Read the second part of my message,btohqsg
oops sorry realise i misread it haha. so choc card transactions are back up? also any idea why up to $250 only?,btohqsg
Because they will pay out of their pocket first and then liquidate the funds to offset the payment made. Having large payments will create an impact on their own pocket  similar to instant withdrawals.,btohqsg
Still unable to pay using Choc although less than $250 leh.,btohqsg
axs and mobile wallet topup transactions have been suspended for choco fin card,btohqsg
Feels like eternity... ‚òπÔ∏èüòÇEveryone I know in finance doing fintech all withdrawing sia!!!,btohqsg
its the talk at work too. mind you they dont care much about cc and rewards and investment usually.,btohqsg
It is a pity I wanted to use choco card to pay for road tax but the amount exceeded,btohqsg
There are other ways.Worst to worst use AMEX TCB for 1.5%. ‚òπÔ∏èüò¢,btohqsg
MariSave insured for the money in the 2.5% interest.. unless u dump it into Maribank invest.. then its not covered,btohqsg
"Hi  stupid question. When redeeming mile for a flight. The airport tax portion is considered under the ""travel"" category right?(For uob lady's card).Thanks!",btohqsg
Hi all any views  on UOB Visa Infinite Metal Card,btohqsg
I already planned to instant withdraw $10k plus on 10th for my credit card payment but sway sway Kanna this shit... luckily I have spare funds some where.,btohqsg
what benifits of the card got your attention?,btohqsg
The lounges and 2.4mpd on FCY,btohqsg
Anyone knows which credit card is best for SimplyGo‚Äîcashback or miles? I used to have the Standard Chartered Smart Credit Card  but after it got nerfed  I canceled it and switched to Chocolate Finance. However  after what happened  I stopped using it. Now  I'm currently using my existing OCBC N90 card.,btohqsg
maybank family and friends? but requires min spend,btohqsg
Unfortunately  for higher rates (like arnd 6%) for SimplyGo  they all come with some form of minimum spend now  mostly $600 or $800. Best case I can think of is UOB ONE  but min $500 across the quarterIf not no min spend u will have to look at either 2% or below cashback or 1.something mpd,btohqsg
If use citibank rewards on hitpay  is it considered online transaction and can get 4mpd? The mcc is 5811,btohqsg
You can google on citi rewards tnc,btohqsg
