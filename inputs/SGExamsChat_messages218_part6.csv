That‚Äôs all the evidence you need,btohqsg
how old are you and have you been physically abused?,btohqsg
Realistically you cant do anything on your own. Living at a friends house or a relatives one seems unfeasible due to school and possibility of parents filimg a police report making it seem youre a delinquent. As others have said the best thing to do is to report to the police as the police and the courts heavily favour the child in cases of domestic violence. But theyre also right when they say you need evidence but it is easy to get it nowadays as you can record it. Good luck,btohqsg
if everything fails then you have no choice but to just study hard move to hostel if you are planning to go to university  move out once you are able to..,btohqsg
