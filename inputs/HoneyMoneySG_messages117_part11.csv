Havenâ€™t noticed one that state that they donâ€™t accept it yet. But are there other cards that does not exclude education fees? How about professional membership fees etc?,btohqsg
Do your own filter. After that can email them.,btohqsg
maybank cards like platinum visa or barcelona,btohqsg
Are we able to add amaze to Apple Pay?,btohqsg
Thank you! Iâ€™ve just checked maybank platinum visa and it requires monthly minimum spend for the entire quarter to be able to get cash back. The course fees are more of a once off hundreds to thousands once or twice a year only.,btohqsg
Hello! I just applied for a Citi rewards card and am wondering if I will be deemed a â€˜new citi card memberâ€™. I cancelled my previous Citi card more than 1 year ago but there was some leftover charges which I only paid off 11 months ago,btohqsg
think they can actually cancel the card after u paid off the bill less annual fee if any?,btohqsg
I was only a few weeks away from the one month mark but didnâ€™t realise that I had leftover charges after cancellation :(,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGIs there any video or article analysis on shall a CPF member participate CPF Life based how many years the members can withdraw the fund since the return/interest generate will go into common pool versus keeping minimum in CPF life - basic  n self invest CPF with higher return.Another scenario:Eg. If a member expect to live till 73 years old  shall the member choose basic or escalating. How much interest is not recoverable from common pool etc.,btohqsg
I do not have one but here's a pretty good walkthrough by Providendhttps://youtu.be/tu9p1Nvfl1U?si=47vPNi1paVPSf4SK,btohqsg
Do anybody know this card? How is it?,btohqsg
This can be big problem my colleague had the same problem then went to lowest credit rating banned from applying cards,btohqsg
Ok card but there are better options at 120k mark. I think can use to pay education and earn miles.,btohqsg
I see. Thanks very much! I have CITI Presitage already  I think this UOB card is not worth applying?,btohqsg
You already had citi prestige  one of the better 120k cards. What is the appeal of UOB VIM to you?,btohqsg
it's more metal than Citi Prestige ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
I don't know actually ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. That's why i asked u all.,btohqsg
I think the $25 transfer fee (as long as you transfer large chunks) isn't too onerous.Personally I think UOB might be more limiting than Citi because you can only transfer to SIA & Cathay Pacific? It looks like redemption from EVA Air to Star Alliance (SIA) is cheaper according to this article:https://suitesmile.com/blog/2024/03/18/cheapest-ways-to-fly-between-singapore-and-europe-using-miles-points-from-singapore-cards/,btohqsg
How about HSBC Infinite compared to Citi Presitage? I found that what I needed most is unlimited Lounge & Airport pickup service. But the HSBC has the cheaper annual fee,btohqsg
Ask what do u want the card for? Lounge? Hotel stay? Accor plus? Personally lifestyle CC amex plat charge is quite good.,btohqsg
Are you hsbc premier client? Cuz hsbc af is 662.,btohqsg
Wow  let me check about the amex,btohqsg
Do you use citi 4nf? I find earn rate of hsbc is very lackluster. And you cant earn much with hsbc revo being nerfed to the ground. And hsbc excluded cardup transactions.,btohqsg
I used once and found that not  cheaper than other websites,btohqsg
for HSBC VI and HSBC T1 at least.,btohqsg
I see. That's so hard to choose ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. I use cardup for my rentals & income taxes. Lounge and Airport Pick-up services r also my strong demands. No need for golf.,btohqsg
I know less about ocbc. May I know this premier is like HSBC premier or a card name?,btohqsg
there is basic ocbc voyage (1.3 mpd) and ocbc premier voyage (1.6mpd but ocbc premier customer only). The rest of the benefits are similar. Unlimited lounge access (no guest)  spend 12k per quarter for 2 limo rides.,btohqsg
Its advantage is less annual fee than citi prestige?,btohqsg
coz it's a visa card  right?,btohqsg
yes. even better if you can get premier voyage for 1.6mpd,btohqsg
i see. let me go to learn more about the details. thank you  guy!!!,btohqsg
Anybody facing error with logging in HSBC app too?,btohqsg
No. You either apply through singsaver or hsbc promo link. Choose your preferred reward accordingly,btohqsg
for citi rewards + amaze pair  can we add amaze card to apple pay and use contactless?,btohqsg
Canâ€™t add amaze to Apple. Every day sure got someone ask this,btohqsg
means have to use physical card to tap?,btohqsg
Yes or you buy an android just to add amaze to the wallet,btohqsg
1). Is unlimited free 1 guest of lounge pass important to you?2). Earn miles from Cardup/iPaymy important to you ?,btohqsg
The thing u got to note is.Most people donâ€™t put their usual spending on prestige or HSBC visa infinite due to the low earn rates.Prestige allows you to clock spending quickly using Citi payall especially during payall promos. This is the biggest win prestige has over HSBC visa infinite,btohqsg
1). not important now coz just broke up  hahaha.2). i think yes  coz i paid my tax & rentals via Cardup. I will earn lots of miles from them,btohqsg
2). If I am not mistaken  HSBC infinite exclude 7399 which is used by Cardup/iPaymy.,btohqsg
I see. that's hard to try. I am lost in limo rides  but this needs 12k transaction on citi in one Q. I might have chance to get it only in tax season,btohqsg
Look at the categories that Citi payall supports. It is very comprehensive.,btohqsg
During tax season  how do you use HSBC infinite to earn miles n get free limo?,btohqsg
However nowadays payall even with promos may not be worth it anymore unless one has some strategies to further reduce the cost of miles acquisition,btohqsg
It seems can not earn miles on HSBC. HSBC has 4 free limo per year itself,btohqsg
tbh hard to earn miles on hsbc. Earn rate for hsbc vi is bad among gen spend card. hsbc revo nerfed badly. No cardup or ipaymy.,btohqsg
Hi all  for credit card limit review  say if I have cards approved for a New Bank in May  I believe this will cause an increase to my overall unsecured credit limit.If I plan to apply for credit limit increase for my existing cards with DBS now  does having new credit limit with New Bank affect chances of DBS reduce my credit limit?I have credit limit increase approved for DBS cards in May but I was foolish to set my own limit instead of letting bank decide the limit for me  and now having second thoughts about letting the bank decide the limit for me instead.So should I still proceed to apply for credit limit increase with DBS or better donâ€™t change it for the time being?,btohqsg
in my experience  your limit with another bank does not affect dbs and vice versa,btohqsg
