i dont think this is real news. for starters... no dates mentioned. also unable to verify with any other legit news source.,btohqsg
Agree...no location also for the rd blocksAnd generally doesnt sound like the way sg police do things,btohqsg
You call cs  they will sound very on the ball and have some pro way of locating customer2 weeks later they call u back to tell u customer uncontactable (as if u dunno  uncontactable thats why call cs for help wat) and all they did was call repeatedly with the same number you had  when its alrdy obvious the scammer doesnt intend to be contacted with that numberThen cs will tell u make police reportWhich will be a waste of time cos it only involves $20  and unless many riders kena like loanshark prank the police got better things to do üôÑ,btohqsg
So  the best solution is go temple get flowers and take flower bath,btohqsg

I am quite bad in estimating time and also greedy to take asap jobs i think is otw with scheduled orders,btohqsg
Strangely all the receivers are very chill when i deliver and they dont seem to mind. It was the senders that kan chiong with me,btohqsg
The receiver for this order even gave me a tip.,btohqsg
Sometimes just need to inform and all ok one,btohqsg

1 drop at a time only can make money if lucky enough to get another job near where u drop the 1st job,btohqsg
Or else difficult. Or multiple drops near 1 another.,btohqsg
Yah just need to accept and move on,btohqsg

I always end up paying there,btohqsg
Tanglin mall got grace period so ok. There got hotels if got jobs just let them know u collect  they will let u go take  but u don't too long. They let u park outside,btohqsg
Hotels but collection at their malls can ah?,btohqsg
My car not atas leh where got let me park my old horse at their front one,btohqsg
Indian restaurants will never be earlyLol,btohqsg
Sometimes the restaurant kan cheong becos your punctuality affects the freshness and quality of their foodEsp places like italian  pizzaThey dont want to deliver cold dishes,btohqsg
Anyone know if this is a restricted area??,btohqsg
For 20 packet of lasi lemak  i wan to try get $15 more for this bird no egg place,btohqsg

No more nx time. Next time no more kfc. Damn scary,btohqsg
Yah simple things can go there. Engine filter oem cheap. I think $8 for Honda/toyota,btohqsg
U never ask for parking reimbursement?,btohqsg
Cham ah LLM buay sai leow,btohqsg
I try chat with customer service vomit blood,btohqsg
Always call first and clarify payment terms for cash job. CS cant do much with private cash jobs. Worst case they ask u make police report. Its LPPL with CS one,btohqsg
Ok so i will wait by 6 to 7pm if customer never transfer i make police report,btohqsg
This the difficult one pick up and drop off the client,btohqsg
U shldnt complete the delivery without the cash,btohqsg
As in dont deliver the goods,btohqsg
Should i go back and take the good?,btohqsg
I had a few private cash job multi stops  i always chase them before my last drop to complete the payment,btohqsg
If it is worth your time then do it lor provided its still there,btohqsg
It near by pick up is not userDrop off not user,btohqsg
Doesnt matter  u got no leverage now. U can try asking CS if u can take back the goods first,btohqsg
I wld tell the customer the parcel still with me and i am at drop off pt. If nvr receive the payment  i will not complete the delivery and it will cost them more later as i need to go make another trip back,btohqsg
I had a sim lim sq order drop CPU and monitor  reach there customer not at home. Item is too valuable to leave at door step customer willing for me to come back at a later hr and pay me extra for the added trip.,btohqsg
Sim lim sq shop paid for the order,btohqsg
If i take back the parent will piss,btohqsg
The problem is no one ans call,btohqsg
Any chance having their hp no can trace this person,btohqsg
More ppl like this die siaa,btohqsg
So who is the one who owes you? The cake shop?,btohqsg
Now i know how taxi driver feel,btohqsg
Usually if they doing business wont scam laBut still bad habit to delay payment,btohqsg
I mean i assume its some home business,btohqsg
I got one Indian restaurant also delay payment,btohqsg
Then they pay up after a few hours,btohqsg
That also happen to me somewhere novena late payment,btohqsg
Restaurants sometimes is they busy  but ya call cs can help remind  make them kan cheong,btohqsg
If the one that made the order is not sender or receiver then who is he?,btohqsg
If middle man that take private DO and sub con out gg,btohqsg
That the problem pick up and user never ans call,btohqsg
But the pick up paid to the user,btohqsg
This kind of ppl take other ppl's time and money for granted,btohqsg
Oh user is middleman?.... u have to be prepared to not get the money üò£,btohqsg
"Just for everyone's general knowledge  when such things happen  even if u make police report they will only keep the report as a record. You not getting paid is not considered a ""scam"". Legally  a scam involves loss of money. In such cases we lose time but we didnt payout/lose money  so its only considered a breach of terms. I tried making a report once  this is what officer explain to me",btohqsg
He never ans call but that was the last seen,btohqsg
Never get paid is ok i want this kind of serve with justice,btohqsg
Not near leh pick up and drop off location,btohqsg
This kind of pattern got intention to siam payment,btohqsg
If he have time to text he can also do a paynow,btohqsg
But so as per what the officer told me  to have justice served u would have to sue him in court üôÅ,btohqsg
Ya sibeh anticlimaxI was all geared up with my story with screenshots and witnesses,btohqsg
Aiyo no lar for a $20 jobI know this is why those scammers get scot free but really who got time/money to sue,btohqsg
I think this person do it many time,btohqsg
My case also  surely not first time,btohqsg
Then that y he will do more,btohqsg
I drive at nite a lot so i am careful with cash jobs  if sender says receiver is paying  i will call receiver to confirm.,btohqsg
Now dosent matter day or night,btohqsg
Yes subsequently thats what i do too,btohqsg
Kenna this type also damn sianz one,btohqsg
Call them.number is not on have to call via watsapp,btohqsg
It was llm agent's fault right,btohqsg
Cant be bah  someone has to key in this data,btohqsg
Missed a few good stacks for my next PU,btohqsg
Werent u saying it was llm agent? Or i misread cos got like 5 threads ongoing at same time ü§£,btohqsg
Fella said it was an error i cant be bothered to argue already,btohqsg
Just want llm to cancel and move on,btohqsg
Ya some ppl are unapologetic abt cancellingThey dunno once the time window missed it can mean no job for next hour,btohqsg
I think LLM shld impose a 50% surcharge on priority/urgent deliveries  then disable stacking or drivers with on going jobs,btohqsg
This was we can only do pt A to pt B but we are compensated,btohqsg
And we have less stress with them chasing us all the time,btohqsg
I tend to miss my turns when i am on the phone lol  end up later,btohqsg
If no urgent fees we have the right to stack and deliver according to our choice,btohqsg
Managed to type the hp no at paynow now found the full name,btohqsg
If ppl never pay up can type at paynow no to find the full name,btohqsg
Everyone thinks their delivery is the most urgent in the world leh ü§≠,btohqsg
Usually I only take one job as rider try to take 2 before end up Ken's complaint for coming late.,btohqsg
Now a days km showing from collection point to deliver point showing lesser than wage or Googlemap.sopls frnds If u also see that prblm just inform in live chat,btohqsg
Can I add money to my wallet to do buy for me,btohqsg
If I pay to my wallet they always remove charges for delivery,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt remove money for sales,btohqsg
for purchase services you have to transfer the purchase money directly to the driver. llm doesnt want to handle any money that doesnt have a commission component.,btohqsg

Once they complaint your rating drop immediately,btohqsg
CS will say they give u 1 ‚≠êÔ∏è,btohqsg
Okay. Noted .. will be mindful to provide a better service to customer in future. As the saying goes  customer is always right. Cheers,btohqsg
Because I try live chat CS call them to bring up my rating CS say they cannot do that,btohqsg
I even show them picture as prove,btohqsg
U need do more pick more people give u 5 star ‚≠êÔ∏è your rating will up automatically üòâ,btohqsg

Most restaurants won't bother to rate you one,btohqsg
Guys issit if we fail to complete the mission we will drop to silver immediately?,btohqsg
I complete a silver mission last week  this week they give me gold. I cant hit this week for sure,btohqsg
I drop from silver tp broze lol,btohqsg
How to just do bronze missions ah? I can barely hit the silver 25 quota,btohqsg
But if nvr clear they didnt downgrade me leh,btohqsg
Wah means i need to fail 2 weeks to downgrade to silver and another 2 weeks to bronze,btohqsg
Played around with lalamove  the rates for same place same dropoff is different morning n night... morning being more and night being lesser,btohqsg
Dont tell me got diamond platinum all,btohqsg
"The thing is the 20min pickup time frame is from lalamove  but in reality many customers are used to a ""grabcar"" mindset where job is assigned to nearest driver - which means arrive in less than 10min. If grabcar  7min alrdy u feel it's too long",btohqsg
If advanced order  the expectation is u are there on_the_dot,btohqsg
The stupid thing also is immediate jobs u must see the timing of the order,btohqsg
Accepted job 1245   reach 1250 but order is 1257,btohqsg
My Rating is 4.18 only lol. Does the rating affect the amount of job you can access to?,btohqsg
If u vs for example me   then i will get the job,btohqsg
Some customer give me 1 star because I came late.,btohqsg
Omg no wonder I see how come so little assignment also the pay very low.,btohqsg
No u will still see the orders,btohqsg
When I click to check the description the assignment already gone!,btohqsg
Very hard to hit when there is specified timing,btohqsg
Down grade from gold to silver game üéÆ over ‚ú®,btohqsg
Bro how.come.u drop to silver? U hit gold.every week mah,btohqsg
No idea leh I'm not active I guess,btohqsg
Mostly look at the ljf how to get active haiz,btohqsg
LOL u mai anyhow ü§£At most 15min...or has it gotten worsw,btohqsg
15min? How to make it in 15 mins during peak hr traffic? I swipe 1 job less than 8km away but traffic took me more than 30mins to reach how?,btohqsg
Customer cancelled...i informed CS they paid me 50% fee thou,btohqsg
The 15min is referring to gojek hahaFor llm  the ideal is take jobs within 3km4km and above will take too long,btohqsg
I once took a 2 km order,btohqsg
Ya have to be familiar with location  some places tricky,btohqsg
U turn out is adam road the expressway,btohqsg
Cos their km is measured by drawing strsight line,btohqsg
Haha yes yesHave to find good location and mark your territory there,btohqsg
At hillcrest just take town jobs n go all the way down lol,btohqsg
They shld put down a ETA of +/- 5mins accuracy rather than straight line distance,btohqsg
Straight line is pure click bait,btohqsg
Straight line only useful if we deliver in tanks,btohqsg
I bought mine for $72. Pay upfront leh.,btohqsg
I think too high tech for themJust look at their gps,btohqsg
They told me is $72 too but will deduct from your wallet grabpay,btohqsg
Hi all. Can I check with y‚Äôall  no paste sticker no incentive?,btohqsg
Want buy from me? Mine brand new. Havent use,btohqsg
Huh u pay upfront? They didn't ask me pay up front. When acc hit the equipment price then they deduct,btohqsg
I never even earn back the money sia. Haha.  I do awhilw then i stop le,btohqsg
The equipment 1 full day can earn back le,btohqsg
I seldom do gf now liao,btohqsg
Gf can earn more then llm actually,btohqsg
Ya. But lazy cycle. Drive also sometimes no place park,btohqsg
Ya cycle quite tired actually. But good things is cluster.,btohqsg
Waa my bicycle always damn far sia,btohqsg
For me I do bukit batok. Sometimes kena Hillview or jurong but still OK la. Go there cfm got order comes,btohqsg
For me  as compared to other delivery app  Lalamove is top for me. Just need to focus. Only grouse is that one need to look at the app all the time. No filtering based on locations/sectors like the old app. So typically could be sharing at the phone for 1 to 2 hours without securing a delivery. I guess have to get accustomed to.,btohqsg
I wish too but need to buy the equipment to activate the account lol.,btohqsg
Anyone knows One Marina Boulevard where to park to drop off?,btohqsg
Normally i try to avoid those jobs with trolley. Could be too heavy for me. Very tiring too,btohqsg
Maybe stingy don't want to hire car service,btohqsg
Because cheaper then expect us riders to do it for them. Idiots,btohqsg
motor dont bother to pick up  will get a call asking bike or car  then immediately another permanent cancellation on your record.,btohqsg
and then have to explain the cancellation.,btohqsg
pickup only if u really enjoy the spending time with CS team.,btohqsg
What a hassle just for entertaining this idiots,btohqsg
Now i got a order for 10am,btohqsg
Cal customer say actually 1130 to deliver and can go take abt 11,btohqsg
Question : update lalamove at 10am and say reach but got to wait till 11am,btohqsg
Few options1)call cs2)10am reach the shop  call Cs after 10min after u arrive. 11 inform Cs what time u pick up. Waiting time 50min.3) call customer to inform Cs to amend the time,btohqsg
10am no orders to start mission!,btohqsg
I see instantly swipe n pray no one take,btohqsg
Hope everyone has huat huat Thursday ü§ëü§ë,btohqsg
Mission impossible just hope no complaints or 1*,btohqsg
Down during lunch time  all orders gg,btohqsg
Just send here I think I won't buy de,btohqsg
No need to match raining Keep,btohqsg
if bike smart matching is competing with stickered-cars  and stickers still count as priority... most of these job wont go to the bikes.,btohqsg
Not into bike jobs unless ++$,btohqsg
At bird no lay egg placr,btohqsg
Maybe bike üèç vs llm üíº vs car sticker üòÇ,btohqsg
the matcing criteria was stated as distance to pickup  rating  cancellation rate  with priority given to sticker. Bikes cannot compete with the sticker at all.,btohqsg
How about fans ( u are my hero),btohqsg
fans wasnt mentioned in the criteria  just those 4 things.,btohqsg
My god west no orders at all,btohqsg
Jialat place u should go citi,btohqsg
Bike equivalent priority should be those with lalabag  just like for incentives,btohqsg
And i believe priority will be given to bike for bike jobs,btohqsg
I think good ratings make a big differenceSeveral times i believe i wasnt the nearest  but got job,btohqsg
Yes if not all run away,btohqsg
Nabez how to hao lian in front of@KeegtAuntie Killer ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
And its very common for females to get better ratings than males,btohqsg
Doesnt mean we're better  ppl are jus more forgiving towards zhar bor,btohqsg
Bad rating how to get job,btohqsg
I got many hearts to throw at you lol,btohqsg
Davidso eng  hit incentive can pk liao ar,btohqsg
This person hoping to get a car to take their motorcycle jobs? Abit er.....,btohqsg
Really roll eyes.. I just saw they threw 2 requests out with same msgs üôÑüôÑüôÑ,btohqsg
Another idiot also don't want to bite car service and unwilling to pay more,btohqsg
Anyway.. Wet roads in many places today.. Everyone ride & drive safe..,btohqsg
Doing business but can't afford to hire the correct services.,btohqsg
Alot like that 1. Multiple stops don't want pay more for car,btohqsg
Should tell CS  they will do the changes,btohqsg
Sometimes u cb the customer. The customer change from motor to car. After u finish the job  give u 1 star. You LL also..,btohqsg
thats y i just suck thumb. next time then get ready to tell CS.,btohqsg
I always just give them 1 star back instead.,btohqsg
I mean tell CS  the item is over sized for bike order  you are there already  the user will need to cancel the job and pay you 50% anyway  ensure you take pictures and shows the item,btohqsg
CS will cancel the job  user will need to pay for the cancellation and re do the order to Car Job,btohqsg
Users need to learn their lesson,btohqsg
Do not even need proceed to the job,btohqsg
Too many drivers give in and the users taking the advantage on all of us,btohqsg
Lousy cso will instead ask you did you call to confirm the items and order.,btohqsg
Any one can do. Direct 60$ payment,btohqsg
Lala shows 41$ but no rider. Call 9424 1642,btohqsg

your rating starts at 5.0 - perfect score. Unfortunately that means it can only go down  or be maintained; can't go up.,btohqsg
if your customers dont rate you anything below 5  you will maintain the perfect 5.0.,btohqsg
Ahh okok .. the crucial parts lies on customers rating .. if they don't rate .. means I'll maintain at 5.0..,btohqsg
