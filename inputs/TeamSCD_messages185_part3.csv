i tot the patty will be thick like the commercial... end up thin thin only,btohqsg
i dont like their beef de... but the improved version is nice,btohqsg
i love double cheese burger  but its too small  need to eat two.  Now 1 can already,btohqsg
First season he raced 2018  Lost to sirotkin whole season. Kept his seat and sirotkin lost his.2019 he went into racing point  kicking ocon out of his seat and ocon was seatless for the year. lost to perez whole season2020 Lost to perez whole season  perez lost his seat.2021 and 2022 he lost both season to vettel  but you'd say Vettel is a 4 time world champion. Fair,btohqsg
tat one 3 bites finish liao,btohqsg
who ask them don't have a rich daddy,btohqsg
He didn't have to prove that he has talent to beat anyone. He just needed to keep up,btohqsg
He didn't lose to all his teammates by 1 or 2 points. It's significant. Many times team mates finished in top 10 in standings  he's not.,btohqsg
Rookies coming in year after year doing better than him sia,btohqsg
there are drivers that teams pay to win  and there are drivers that teams get paid to keep,btohqsg
he is still a rookie to me,btohqsg
And his jr career also not that special. He didn't even race in F2,btohqsg
It baffles me that people actually supports him  but nah  other than daddy's money. He's quite trash tbh. There are better racers out there more deserving of a seat.,btohqsg
so who do you pick mazaspin or stroll,btohqsg
at least makeaspin is fun to watch,btohqsg
So maybe i'll pick that one,btohqsg
If we faster we wont be sitting here kaopei them alr,btohqsg
i don't understand how while driving you adjust brake bias and stuff,btohqsg
I can do it in sims la.,btohqsg
well  we nv get in the car before... u nv know,btohqsg
They do have specific dials just for braking  so can just roll on the fly,btohqsg
But i think it's crazy to nail it corner after corner,btohqsg
while driving perfectly to the lines,btohqsg
ya need alot of focus... i play f1 game  halfway cannot focus liao... sometimes just drive straight and miss turn,btohqsg
and they don't have green line on the floor that turns red,btohqsg
2018 he scored 6/7 points for williams,btohqsg
maybe i should put some effort into doing up a sim rig,btohqsg
Sirotkin out-qualified Stroll at twelve of the twenty-one races.,btohqsg
Maybe 2018 doesnt say much cos sirotkin also quite bad. He crashed so much he cannot convert positions to points,btohqsg
but he didnâ€™t finish ahead of him lolol,btohqsg
i feel if u donâ€™t like a driver,btohqsg
very hard to see eye to eye,btohqsg
There's nothing to like about him,btohqsg
there is ah but thatâ€™s just you haha,btohqsg
rest of us think he has talent and can drive soooooo,btohqsg
i think he has some talent... but can't drive,btohqsg
lolol ya that was q funny,btohqsg
I am sure i am not the only one bro,btohqsg
why the hate sia he never do anyth to u also ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
talentless i think he wonâ€™t make f1 no matter how rich,btohqsg
okay thereâ€™s rich drivers in f2 like gelael his father owns all of kfc in indonesia or smth,btohqsg
but no f1 cos talent not there,btohqsg
Cos his father havent reacht he point of buying a team for him,btohqsg
He almost joined F1 when KFC sponsored Toro Rosso,btohqsg
But the deal didn't make it,btohqsg
if i remember correctly you need to be within a certain amount of time from the fastest guy in quali to race,btohqsg
so if you too slow  can't race also,btohqsg
I've nothing against him  I just think without his father  he wont be in F1 alr,btohqsg
cos many faster drivers lost their seats cos of him,btohqsg
Ocon and Perez are 2 very big examples,btohqsg
