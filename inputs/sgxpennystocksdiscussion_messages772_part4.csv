Credit Suisse Default Swaps Are 18 Times UBS  9 Times Deutsche Bank:Source1. The cost of insuring the bonds of Credit Suisse Group AG against default in the near-term is approaching a level that typically signals serious investor concerns.2. One-year credit default swaps for the embattled Swiss lender were indicated at 835.9 basis points on Tuesdayâ€™s close of business  based on pricing source CMAQ. Other pricing sources point to a further rise on Wednesday  while a level of 1 000 would indicate serious concern. The current level is about 18 times the one-year CDS for rival Swiss bank UBS Group AG  and about 9 times the equivalent for Deutsche Bank AG.3. Credit Suisse is in the midst of a complex three-year restructuring in a bid to return the bank to profitability. It was hard hit by the recent wave of bearishness triggered by Silicon Valley Bankâ€™s demise  with its five-year CDS spreads hitting a record. Shares hit a new record low Wednesday after the bankâ€™s top shareholder ruled out providing more financial assistance to the struggling Swiss bank  citing regulatory constraints.More here,btohqsg
