It just got nerfed this morning :( Grab MC can‚Äôt top up any e wallets like Revolut and Youtrip anymore,btohqsg
i'm brainstorming. Welcome to ideas after grab nerf,btohqsg
Just when I purchased Revolut metal to get the 2.7% cash back grab nerfs the top up üò≠,btohqsg
That often apply only to local cards to local rentals. It‚Äôs not that common for international car rentals. Also  3rd party insurance often require the damage to be charged first and will only get waived/reduced after the insurance companies sort out their end of investigations,btohqsg
Hmmm. Any other suggestions to buy overseas rental insurance? I booked directly with Enterprise (got company discount). But for insurance buying on site would be super expensive‚Ä¶so thinking of alternatives.,btohqsg
Official: Grab has nerfed top-ups to other prepaid wallets and PayNow QR this morning. So all these Youtrip  Revolut  Bigpay cannot be topped up by Grabpay Card nowFor discussion: Visithttps://t.me/honeymoneysg,btohqsg
