i used to go geylang alot,btohqsg
whats the main attraction of clubs,btohqsg
the alcohol also adds to the experience,btohqsg
No way ppl fk inside rite,btohqsg
its always the building nearby that kenna,btohqsg

i know the responsbilities of a NSman and NSF are diff,btohqsg
nsman just comes off my tongue more than a nsf  cause the f behind stands for fulltime,btohqsg
I know all the hardcore clubbers here,btohqsg
after all the stories my father/relatives and friends told me about serving their ns,btohqsg
Ngl i find when ppl talk about ns it gets boring,btohqsg
nvm hopefully i still got 2 years  if not 3 before that,btohqsg
cause my poly can shift the graduation day by 1 full year,btohqsg

but ya kun is still expensive,btohqsg
Yeah  cause sometimes travelers want go back got spare cash then just anyhow whack,btohqsg
well inflation didnt need to be as high as it needed to be but thanks russia and thanks to companies who are using the gst rise as a cover up for inflation,btohqsg
have a feeling a world war just around the corner,btohqsg
And also when everyone around you is raising prices  it doesn’t look as bad when you raise prices too so why not earn the extra profits  and at the same time slap on the excuses of “increasing costs of raw materials  manpower  transport  rental  etc.” to justify the excessive increase too,btohqsg
So coincidental that when oil prices rose to their highest last year due to “supply chain disruptions”  just so happen that oil companies also reported their all-time high profits too  haha,btohqsg
then all these ESG efforts out,btohqsg
but not really making an impact,btohqsg
all this tax increase and i still getting paid peanuts to serve nation,btohqsg
well at least they are finally increasing ns pay…during my 2 years when the prices were surging like crazy and having to live through that without a pay increase. stupid sia only when prices are stabilising then increase pay lol,btohqsg
