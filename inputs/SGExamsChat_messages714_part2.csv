Skill issue tbh.OP you deserved it since you had TWO YEARS to prepare for A LEVELS and yet you decided to not do anything about it.You didn't study hard enough. You didn't evaluate and improve upon your study methods. You didn't seek help early and go tuition if needed. You didn't attempt to fix your mental health issues (READ: Mental health issues don't exist  it's just in your head and you're simply weak minded). You didn't do many things you could've done. Now just bear the consequences of shitty results.After all  not many people get 85+ RP.To all future JC students:Pls fucking study as hard as you can don't fucking have any fuckshit excuses like mental health (the only time to ever pull that card is in the SAF) and all that friendship problems. Just fucking study smart and hard and ignore everything else you will get 85+ RP trust me.so u don't end up one week before prelims questioning what the fuck have u done for the past year,btohqsg
