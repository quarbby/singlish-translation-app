Lol nautic has a volume of 26 lots. Don‚Äôt anyhow la,btohqsg
do u know what business they have that makes money for them?,btohqsg
Yea  their job is to amplify news. Up 0.1%  they say surge. Drop 1%  it‚Äôs plummet,btohqsg
Am just talking about your comment on it going up. Not about the merits of the company,btohqsg
Read their news like taking roller coaster,btohqsg
exactly my point of warning the penny folks. i share Furion's mindset that I hate ppl to lose their hard earned $,btohqsg
but hey  I might be wrong. thats the whole point of dyodd isnt it,btohqsg
Lol. Ok. But 26 lots doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs going up.,btohqsg
Low vol day for JT  watch for durians.,btohqsg
UG strong support at 69  MA20 and baseline. Low vol.,btohqsg
Ok you totally don‚Äôt get my point. Volume matters as much as price.,btohqsg
well maybe i dont get your point but i do know how pump&dump works.,btohqsg
Woohooo 26 Lots for a pump n dump. Lol,btohqsg
haha. u got $ stuck in nauticAwt is it  why so emo?,btohqsg
Not vested. Just don‚Äôt like people anyhow ‚Äúwarn‚Äù others about fake news.,btohqsg
I tot u said quit liao?,btohqsg
okok lets see by end of today if that 2pips up is fake news or not,btohqsg
No wonder alicex don't trust Jerry...,btohqsg
Delete your account. wait next year.,btohqsg
that's assuming the stock pick isn't rubbish or the company doesn't fold midway,btohqsg
hmm still wait n see lol quite strong surprisingly but i shorted yzj haha,btohqsg
that tactic may work for indexes,btohqsg
but not really for individual stonk,btohqsg
sometimes i wonder isit better just whack s&p index sua since it gives ~10% return annually on average,btohqsg
auto kick out lousy companies and add in good ones  no work needed can sleep well too,btohqsg
sti cmi haha put a decade u see your portfolio sideways,btohqsg
SP now got 3 confirm infected,btohqsg
u can. but you'll miss the adrenaline rush fun when seeing that green green numbers,btohqsg
haha whats stopping u from closing all ur sgx acct and whack that s&p,btohqsg
oo first time i heard of this  the portfolio looks not bad leh,btohqsg
greed and wishful thinking that playing pennies can outperform the index üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Alot sia. AOA also not bad,btohqsg
is a good way to lose monety,btohqsg
people who trust a billionaire words on investment,btohqsg
deserve to lose their  money anyway,btohqsg
wooo more chai png at the end of the month,btohqsg
exactly. its the endorphins in ur head that keeps you coming back to these 'quick wins',btohqsg
Going to rocket after this rest,btohqsg
i would have gone bitcoin crypto or US side,btohqsg
i just want a better future for myself,btohqsg
get myself out of this shethole,btohqsg
endorphins come in volume one leh  not in bit 0 or 1 value. like betting small or big  it bears different 'happiness' when u win,btohqsg
there's pyschology behind stock trading leh. adam khoo say one not me. accepting it early means you can prepare better to whats coming.,btohqsg
Hi  here is something I thought you might find interesting: -https://uk.investing.com/news/economy/dollar-steadies-before-fed-minutes-bitcoin-stumbles-2376754,btohqsg
but anyway  just my two cents.,btohqsg
let me dissect what is so annoying or offputting about your statement,btohqsg
it has presumptions  baked into it,btohqsg
that people do not understand that trading  is a warfare of psychology,btohqsg
and that you know better what the person is feeling than the person himself,btohqsg
and then deflecting the responsibility to Adam khoo.,btohqsg
