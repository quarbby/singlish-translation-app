no la need go cross country work bobian.. still need be chaffeur for the kids,btohqsg
he clear carbon every weekend HAHA,btohqsg
That was before you switched to EV?,btohqsg
156 twinspark  alfa 33 (problematic) and jts,btohqsg
it is very very fuel saving.,btohqsg
go to kl and back 700 km without refueling,btohqsg
so you still drive alfa? thats nice! can last very long haha,btohqsg
Which workshop do you recommend for alfa?,btohqsg
if you use your VW to do grab  must be impressive to many,btohqsg
People say Alfa have reliability issues. Is that true?,btohqsg
But decided to go for ev?,btohqsg
i think collectively the car community would agree with that no matter the love for the brand,btohqsg
Not allowed due to safety features LMAO,btohqsg
after 2000  NO. before 2000. lots of issues. i owned before and after 2000 and so i know,btohqsg
But I chauffeur for wedding coupes instead,btohqsg
even as a big fan  jeremy clarkson objectively agreed that both old and new alfas have issues,btohqsg
The new Giulia really solid though  looks super nice also,btohqsg
love the italian DNA in it,btohqsg
no. that was 2018 end when my friend who is keen to buy giulia  asked me to go with him to test drive. he fell in love instantly. but the price is ridiculously high and so he gave up the idea,btohqsg
ahhh so what do you own know  you sound like a pretty dignified petrolhead! :),btohqsg
Nice to see people appreciating local production,btohqsg
you got to test it to find out. because people form opinions and hearsay without open mind.,btohqsg
Beside the exhaust note I really find nothing good about the car haha,btohqsg
but testing a brand new car does not give you a full sense of a cars reliabilty no?,btohqsg
Same way people think BMW not reliable  etc.,btohqsg
but yes i agree with this  really vaild point sir,btohqsg
many of my friends are like you. they would not even get close to alfa  let alone to even test drive itr,btohqsg
last very long in the workshop or on the road?,btohqsg
many form judegments based on hearsay. mind is closed,btohqsg
Need a long term test as such,btohqsg
if the price is low  i will buy it because i know it is a good car,btohqsg
would love to drive one tbh  giulia veloce looks like a very good package! much btr than C250 and 330 imo!,btohqsg
but my point is  a test drive is at most 5km right?,btohqsg
Like a lease maybe or subscription program like Audi on demand or bmw subscription,btohqsg
But it is true that older cars are over-engineered to last.,btohqsg
so you cannot say a car is reliable if it does not break down in 5km haha,btohqsg
the first alfa i owned for 10 years!,btohqsg
car must last 5 years not 5km at test drive,btohqsg
I agree  a lot of people mind closed these day  not thinking properly,btohqsg
which jts version did you have?,btohqsg
156 jts. the 159 jts is a better one,btohqsg
"The best way to ""test drive"" a car is to take grab and ask the driver about the car.",btohqsg
i agree sadly many singaporeans dont think properly :(,btohqsg
thats why i asked my grab driver about his E63,btohqsg
Some drivers whack only  never do maintanence on time until their gearbox piang,btohqsg
yes  love the workshop more than my front porchðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
thankfully you did not purchase the giulia qv  think e63 was a wise move haha,btohqsg
qv does sound better tho haha,btohqsg
indeed hahahaha  this year my WRX STI alr go workshop twice :(,btohqsg
you see - many hear problems without really expericing it. that is fine. but at least approach new models with open mind. it is like saying hyundai is a tarrible car. it used to be bad. but companies can improve over the years. the matrix is terrible. sonata in the 2000s. but then they are now very good. same thing with alfa  they have got better and the giulia is high quality,btohqsg
