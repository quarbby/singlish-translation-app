There's only 25 RHD units out of the 150 GTS' ever made,btohqsg
"Very few with the GTS actually drive them too much as it is classed as a collector's car  many keep it to low or delivery mileage. The ""regular"" e9X M3s are also on the rise as they start entering the modern classic era slowly and offer a great driving experience and a V8 motor in an M3",btohqsg
