Calling Australia a island would be like calling the UK a Island nation,btohqsg
No it won't because we won't call it the UK already,btohqsg
Australia the continent and Australia the country are 2 distinct terms,btohqsg
We would just call it Scotland England and Wales,btohqsg
Btw I’m very sure Australia’s continent is called Oceania,btohqsg
Oh boy that's another can of worms,btohqsg
Indeed cause Taiwan is part of Oceania,btohqsg
There are mutiple videos made on this topic and it is a contentious issue...,btohqsg
Huh? No what then is japan oceania,btohqsg
What even is the fucking definition of oceania,btohqsg
What include the entire Pacific ocean,btohqsg
Then Japan would be a part,btohqsg
That is not a fucking definition,btohqsg
Also it ain't even a universally accepted definition,btohqsg
I know for one the entire PRC will deny that fact,btohqsg
Heres a useful video on the issue,btohqsg
The Australia you have referenced is one of a four micro-continent,btohqsg
Give me a definition in which stands up,btohqsg
What in the geo is this,btohqsg
Idk this guy is trying to argue australia isn't a continent,btohqsg
This is why I said microcontinent,btohqsg
I’m not trying to say Australia is not a continent but I think you have a skewed understanding of Oceania,btohqsg
And I am saying oceania is not a continent because it violates the rules for a continent,btohqsg
Which is a contiguous large land mass,btohqsg
Alright  I see. I mean Britannica is really reliable but the sources I’ve shown came from the UN and NationalGeographic,btohqsg
I am confused as to your argument so would you like to debate as to the veracity of the sources now?,btohqsg
Yes I wanna gonna say the taiwan issue a whole new can of worms,btohqsg
Oh no the geography queen is here,btohqsg
how does poly works actually ah  Im Malaysian lol,btohqsg
I thought the only Geography royalty only goes to Imperial Zeng,btohqsg
You got option to do A’s or poly,btohqsg
What do you want to know about poly,btohqsg
can you take two panadol doses at once,btohqsg
Like the admission to poly or what to do after poly,btohqsg
oh how  the course structure works,btohqsg
is it like one college  that offers all bunch of weird modules and you mix and match?,btohqsg
or is something like Diploma in XYZ Engineering type of things?,btohqsg
Take an ibuprofen if u rlly need it,btohqsg
BUT sometimes we got similar modules,btohqsg
Some non business course has financial and accounting module,btohqsg
You guys got a engineering poly equivalent,btohqsg
ohh means  linked modules between courses? like bridging courses?,btohqsg
Every year 1 student in an engineering school learns the same thing,btohqsg
that's a private* college also no ones goes there,btohqsg
No it's like general modules so like communication is usually a mandatory one and critical thinking,btohqsg
Common modules for all courses and schools,btohqsg
For other schools and polys it's different but broadly if it's the same u can bet there is a common course for those,btohqsg
Like school of humanities ofc don’t have ah,btohqsg
our politeknik is something like an national exam as well. All the schools sit the same paper lol,btohqsg
I mean the kind of things you will be learning are around the same caliber,btohqsg
