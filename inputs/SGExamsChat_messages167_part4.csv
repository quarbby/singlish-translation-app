I got one time skip my sleep cycle,btohqsg
I start doing work at 8pm,btohqsg
In the morning I not productive,btohqsg
That was why luckily math was in the afternoon,btohqsg
But lucky math was in the afternoon and not morning,btohqsg
Bet Iâ€™m not gonna do anything,btohqsg
I need more night study friends honestly,btohqsg
Before chinese paper it was so scary,btohqsg
I am too nervous yet too relax,btohqsg
I only have like 7-8 that actually vc and study with my at night,btohqsg
I wonder how it like on mon,btohqsg
Yo guys just curious for ur opinions here. Yall think if i take a&e math in 2021 i can double A1 for both anot? Took emath in 2019 and got an A2 but never took amath back in sec sch. Currently in poly and i have adjusted my schedule such that i can commit to it. Covered some topics in amath alr as im currently in pfp and above avg standard for math? But am not sure if taking both is feasible because technically only amath useful for me? What do yall think?,btohqsg
Should I eat it with ice cream lmao,btohqsg
Personally i feel amath easier to A1 than emath,btohqsg
If ur confident  go for it,btohqsg
Plus 2021 theyre removing more topics,btohqsg
The thing about emath is even tho i rusty right but i practiced alot last yr so i still rmb,btohqsg
Why u flex ur steak hahaha,btohqsg
I choosing the 4047 syllabus tho,btohqsg
Alpha beta is easy but yes modulus shld go,btohqsg
Emarh is a lot of understanding,btohqsg
Log expo and power graphs too,btohqsg
But one of my prelim papers if I rmb go be damn mean,btohqsg
I taking it rather than the new syllabus,btohqsg
Need expand the entire thing cause I never memorise,btohqsg
That one is legit just memorise,btohqsg
I just dk eh cuz what if i retake emath then A2 again then i spend lesser time for amath,btohqsg
My prelim question also quite hard this year,btohqsg
They ask prove the value of beta or smthing,btohqsg
Just curious  why u want retake o level ah,btohqsg
Bc poly math not in depth to prepare for higher level math,btohqsg
And i see no harm taking it,btohqsg
They need u to get cert?,btohqsg
Cos if u ask me  I don't really see a point to retake unless necessary  like can self learn also,btohqsg
Nope but i actly have been thinking of it for a few months and looking through the syllabus and how it is taught in poly style,btohqsg
Or I mean like since u aler learning might as well take,btohqsg
For first year sem 1 i mean,btohqsg
But will what u learn in Amarh be applicable to ur poly tho,btohqsg
Cos I rmb there's some quite obsecure stuff,btohqsg
Just trigo and differentiation it doesnt even touch on integration,btohqsg
And the exam questions they put out is damn simple,btohqsg
So ure taking o level amath to prep for poly mathM,btohqsg
Ultimately ur decision bah  but if I'm i wouldnt,btohqsg
Cos I have to put myself thru an exam,btohqsg
And the entire syllabus and all,btohqsg
Waste time only for me I think,btohqsg
When ur poly doesn't need all,btohqsg
Maybe just self learn those chapter that u need,btohqsg
Have linear algebra induction vectors 1st 2nd order DE,btohqsg
The y1 math just too cmi imo,btohqsg
