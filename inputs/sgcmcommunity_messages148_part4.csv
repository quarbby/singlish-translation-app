Shell and Volkswagen open first Flexpole charger in GermanyThe Volkswagen Elli Flexpole charger can offer charging speeds of up to 150kW without the need to be connected to a high-voltage grid.‚û°Ô∏è Read itHERE!üëâüèª React with ‚ö°Ô∏è if you want this to come to SG!,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt really care if I kena cut,btohqsg
I just learn to make peace within myself,btohqsg
I will give chance if they show some kinda thankful gesture,btohqsg
Else prepare to be overtaken and slowed down,btohqsg
Also if you gonna cut me  better not be leaving gaps,btohqsg
i have missed out so much recently,btohqsg
Eh how Uk its golf haha,btohqsg
Then why you say friend the first time siol,btohqsg
Nothing wrong with doing something for mom la,btohqsg
All my mom complains about is my car too low,btohqsg
Hi. Can i get some advise. Buying new vehicle like motorbike and car they will get the last 6 months average of COE?,btohqsg
I've learnt the hard way that the magnetic shades don't go well with the desire to drive with window open. Had one on my 116d  drove a bit too fast only it flew out of the bracket and hit me in the face,btohqsg
So to confirm buying new vehicles is 3 months average COE we are paying then?,btohqsg
https://www.facebook.com/RoyalMotorGrandeur?mibextid=LQQJ4dhttps://www.facebook.com/carchoicesg?mibextid=LQQJ4dAnyone got experience getting their car with these two ?,btohqsg
Mine flew out of my elantra HAHAH,btohqsg
They selectively sell car to you based on how much loan you choose to take.,btohqsg
If those car dealer keep pushing u for 70 to 100% loan. Its red flag becos u will pay more than the current selling price in the future and they can earn big fat commission from you.,btohqsg
Always buy within ur preferred finances,btohqsg
No one knows best except urself,btohqsg
MAS and bank max is 70%,btohqsg
More than 70% is their in house loan which they charge u 3 to 4 % interest rate.,btohqsg
"When u see those dealer advertisement put ""ex bankruptcy  high risk etc. are welcome""   it means they will loan you from their own finance department but charge u higher interest. Not the bank",btohqsg
That's why car dealers and property agent commission fee so fat  becos they work with bank to lure us into their high interest loan scheme. This is business and its dirty but legit,btohqsg
Yes last time my magnet shade flew out hit people  also cannot put my arm out,btohqsg
No good the RoyalMotor smt  hard sell to the max,btohqsg
"Just a tip  when u browse for car in sgcarmart or any website   don't just look at the car picture. See their description. If they put ""100% loan avaliable  0 down-payment   in house loan avaliable or ex bankruptcy welcome etc.""    I would avoid them if I were u as they will typically play with the admin fee  penalty charges and interest rate just to get u sign the 70 to 100% loan.",btohqsg
If u take less than 50% loan even though u have plenty of cash to pay down payment  the dealer will increase their admin fee and penalty charges. Then u r paying more than their advertised price.,btohqsg
"Their ""admin"" fee is their kopi money. Its pure nonsense.",btohqsg
Their admin paperwork only requires loan agreement  sales agreement  insurance quote and LTA transfer ownership. All these I also can do myself online,btohqsg
Then I would suggest you get cars from direct sellers,btohqsg
I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying the admin fee for them to do my paperwork,btohqsg
If u have the money. 1k to 3k admin fee,btohqsg
Full loan is the way to go,btohqsg
U must be a dealer I suppose,btohqsg
But I always full loan my car üëçüèº,btohqsg
Problem with direct is Lemon Law doesnt apply,btohqsg
Yeah but he doesn‚Äôt want to pay admin fee,btohqsg
U can get direct or non direct seller to do PPI,btohqsg
But at the end of the day  if within 6 months something piang and its not wear n tear,btohqsg
U have some recourse under a dealer than a direct owner,btohqsg
Not true. Some mechanics may anyhow say ur car problem not due to engine and gearbox so not cover under warranty,btohqsg
Don't believe in the warranty too much,btohqsg
Few have complained in a car forum about their 6 months warranty is useless,btohqsg
Cus if the dealer dw to negotiate with u,btohqsg
Also not much but time wastage nia. So as u repair u keep records of documentation,btohqsg
Its becus yall dw fight all the way thats why the dealers think consumers easy to bully.,btohqsg
Everything No use No use. I rather try rather than just give up,btohqsg
