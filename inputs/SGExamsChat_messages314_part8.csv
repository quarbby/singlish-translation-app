While reddit does exaggerate on alot of points  there is some merit behind it i suppose,btohqsg
Ofc it has too be true to some extent but considering the student is ready to work hard are the Teachers willing to help … I’m rmber seeing a post where they claimed that their teacher often grey ticked them and wouldn’t reply to ever help. There were a lot of problems such as biased dsa towards ignite students or even girls.,btohqsg
I understand that every school has its problems but cj seems to have q a few more problems than other jcs,btohqsg
Overall would you recommend cj to someone who wants to go to the sci stream. Possibly PCMe ?,btohqsg
or do u think another school would be a better choice ? :),btohqsg
Is it the nearest to ur house?,btohqsg
not rlly but there’s a direct bus frm my house to either cj or jpjc which are my two options rn so distance isn’t a problem,btohqsg
Tm/asr/jp are better choices esepcially science stream. Cj has underperformed in the alvls compared to the jcs mentioned  even for jp with a higher COP yes,btohqsg
so jp sci > cj sci ?,btohqsg
Asr would be better for phy i suppose,btohqsg
i don’t meet the cut off fr asr too bad n tm is too far fr me,btohqsg
so it’s either jp sci or cj sci fr me 😢,btohqsg
anyone got eae to rp  electrical & electronics engineering?,btohqsg
R u nearer to jp than to cj?,btohqsg
I am from np if u need any advice u can dm me :),btohqsg
was the pee meme nee ann or np,btohqsg
I would say it’s decent but don’t bet on np for food choices,btohqsg
I barely eat in school anyway,btohqsg
How is the walk up the hill ?,btohqsg
Not that far I’m from business my school is the closest,btohqsg
22  English A1  which ngl I'm happy with considering I had to cram and self teach 4 yrs worth of education in 10 mnths,btohqsg
I remember taking shuttle bus inside sp,btohqsg

You think I can get in?,btohqsg
I dunno if first 2 can but I know last 3 shud be able to,btohqsg
hii uh can dae aft jae?,btohqsg
is anyone here in hlfm in np :),btohqsg
or like sch of DE in general,btohqsg
Hello yk dae phase 2 is it for those who couldn’t go through JAE?,btohqsg
Hi can I ask whether there is a change of syllabus in this year's Os subjects,btohqsg
They say they will accept a net aggregate of 11,btohqsg
net aggregate is net gross aggregate - cca pts,btohqsg
Is “aggregate” 12 and “net-aggregate” 10?,btohqsg
Oh so they just did not include right? I though they forgot or something,btohqsg
U can check the private candidate web uh,btohqsg
actl I not too sure  never seen this before  you can calculate ur L1R5 on your own then - 2,btohqsg
But if you are taking POA or A math,btohqsg
Then it will be the new syllabus,btohqsg
It's for those who didn't get the course via JAE (it's up to the best of my knowledge),btohqsg
Can someone confirm “net aggregate” is the 12-2=10 and what they show “aggregate” is not they think is 14-2=12?,btohqsg
u cannot calculate ur own l1r5 meh,btohqsg
But I scared the system think is 14-2=12,btohqsg
my bad this one i can't help you  but you wait for other O level candidates to reply you bah if theirs is the same haha,btohqsg
If got problem I need to call them up,btohqsg
Opp but right  the aggregate there should be before minusing CCA :>,btohqsg
