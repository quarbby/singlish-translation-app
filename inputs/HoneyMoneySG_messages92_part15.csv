Does anyone know how much is the FRS in 2030? Cpf only published till 2027.  As I will turn 55 in 6.5 years  I'm working backwards to see how much I can earn from compounding interest within this 6.5 years assuming  I already reached FRS now. Any excess will flow to OA when I reach 55. Hence  I want to make sure to utilise this 4.08% compounding within 6.5 years.,btohqsg
