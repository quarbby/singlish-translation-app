in the past we often thought supercars cant be driven everyday. this is the euro way,btohqsg
just like if you own a civic type r. you want to be able to revv it high and yet drive it everyday with such reliability. and low maintenance costs,btohqsg
haha exactly why i got volvolor,btohqsg
u just want a comfortable stylish ride from point A-B,btohqsg
why u dont like altis ah HAHA,btohqsg
"altis is quite dangerous. it can ""buang"" easily when you corner fast",btohqsg
nowadays i feel toyota not worth buying because they premium also high,btohqsg
😂😂😂 no say boring la but there are cheaper alternatives that provide the same quality,btohqsg
altis not boring? oh no. you have veered to the toyota side. but be objective,btohqsg
here i dont debate reliability and ruggedness. toyota is very good and so is mazda nissan,btohqsg
but among the 3 toyota is known to be boring,btohqsg
if you dont mind this then okay. i owned a vios for 4 years i know,btohqsg
u can make any car fun tbh,btohqsg
ony thing failed is water pump and fan motor,btohqsg
if a car is inherently built this way  no amount of mods can change the basic characteristics.,btohqsg
its like driving a Russian Lada fast  its more of thrill than being fast haha,btohqsg
i have seen those TGR with vios and it looked quite fun tbh HAHA,btohqsg
that is why i buy a fun car with good fundamantals and drive. i dont modify car.,btohqsg
In stock form  it caters to its target audience. Drive a car from Point A to B lor,btohqsg
so  instead of buying altis to modiy  why not buy a mazda 3 that has the fun genes in it,btohqsg
mazda 4 is also from a to b,btohqsg
Mazda 3 is abit more expensive right?,btohqsg
ehh mazda 2 is a toyota yaris leh,btohqsg
dont destory cars with mods. maybe it's me. but that is what i do,btohqsg
u sat in a mazda 2 before anot,btohqsg
i cldnt even fit in the rear seats,btohqsg
it is a basic car budget car but at least fun la,btohqsg
i feel like too small car also dangerous,btohqsg
some harleys have wider tires than them  not sure how safe it is during rainy conditions,btohqsg
Toyota Yaris is a rebadged mazda2,btohqsg
mazda 2 is far more better than yaris la. it uses the fun skyactiv auto trans,btohqsg
maybe the floor plan body rmaisn that of yaris. but the change in trans has changed it fromn boring to lively,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/yvFHtR6-PaQsurely this is a LOT better than yaris,btohqsg
or hear what he has to say...https://youtu.be/f-KtOndcUg4,btohqsg
Boss altis not a brand leh 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Haha. So far I only know altos Toyota responses,btohqsg
I should really stop replying to bots,btohqsg
I’ve getting messaged by them ALOT,btohqsg
The other one looking for company still around also 🤣,btohqsg
Ah that’s why we are keeping her 😂,btohqsg
Brembo calipers use wad colour nicest?,btohqsg
Because red goes well with black la,btohqsg
And interior all black as well or have another color?,btohqsg
If all black  can go with anything honestly  just need to make sure you don't mismatch with other details you might have,btohqsg
😆 common because the combination works ma,btohqsg
