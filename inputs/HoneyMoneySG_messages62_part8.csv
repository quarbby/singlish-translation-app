Leaking behind this chat so many members don't u not notice onky few of us regular is chatting Sharing,btohqsg
Then who is the 9k unknown lurking,btohqsg
i didnt get too. should i email or call them?,btohqsg
I agree with your observations. Risk reward for fixed income  especially the longer end of the curve is not favourable now. Let‚Äôs see how towards the end of the year‚Ä¶ good job on finding the eSaver 3.4%! Chris had also been helpful to share this here üëçüèª,btohqsg
if you want to be kiasu like me  you could live chat UOB and ask them to manually confirm that everything is ok for your account.I honestly think it is justified because they are actually quite late (usually 15th of the month based on past cycles).I know offiically it is 31st August  but IF YOU MISS IT (whether honest mistake or you made an error)  it is too late if you try to rectify it on 1st Sep.P.S. this one not hack or what... it is OK to check with CSOs.. hahahaha,btohqsg
For me  still waiting for the right valuations before making any moves. Dry powder in high interest savings account now (CIMB sg at 3.5%) üôèüèª,btohqsg
OCBC gives 3.7% interest rate  is this the best at the moment to keep 200k?,btohqsg
Edit: On 2nd thoughts  not a good card.Check with those who have bought cars here,btohqsg
Yes  for the premier dividend plus if you want no frills and in a local bank,btohqsg
Hi  anyone tried using cardup as eligible transactions for SCB signup gift?,btohqsg
Ok I will use your referal. What card should I get then?,btohqsg
My personal favourite is OCBC Titanium Rewards  then apply at 12pm/3pm daily to get a shot at winiing Dyson Airwraphttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/124548,btohqsg
ask the merchant what is their MCC  or check against heymax,btohqsg
Why does UOB KrisFlyer come to your mind? No capped limits?,btohqsg
It's good rate but u also need to ensure a top of up min 2k monthly plus no withdrawn.,btohqsg
Online shopping with whitelisted MCC earns up capped 3mpd,btohqsg
But ya check MCC first.. though in case if it doesn't go through at least got 1.2mpd,btohqsg
Actually my first deposit was $8k charged to UOB KrisFlyer on 24th July by random caught by surprise roadshow contactless mobile payment. It seemed the monthly statement don‚Äôt show MCC also. Hard to tell. ü§î,btohqsg
Looks like UOB VS + PPV then. Ignore my previous suggestion@kaurus2022,btohqsg
Which website can access this software?,btohqsg
It won't show mcc. You have to chat to know,btohqsg
No more chance to use credit card Liao. Car sales guy say cannot Liao. Funny guy.,btohqsg
It is normal.. only deposit can use credit card (to entice you to quickly buy it)after locked u in already  cannot use CC to pay,btohqsg

Most likely boss say cannot because of cc fees 3+%,btohqsg
The app is just a website  disappointing,btohqsg
isn't it better  don't take up your phone storage,btohqsg
Just get my ega bonus interest and withdraw all to $0  is that okay?,btohqsg
is there an automated way to check txn MCCs in the tmrw app? been poking around and can't seem to find any sort of chatbot,btohqsg
aw. gotta call in i suppose,btohqsg
Can chat ah.Uob.com.sg/chatthen select chat with us  it's real cso chatting,btohqsg
whoa. this definitely beats sitting on the phone. thanks!,btohqsg
Maybe. Wait and see. If my UOB solitaire card category includes TRAVEL  I expect it to earn 6 mpd when I pay at hotel on checkin date. But if I pair it with amAze  I worry it erase the travel and become online category which result in zero mpd. Is my concept correct?,btohqsg
Make sure you ask them whether they're from credit card dept. If not  end chat then try again.,btohqsg
"Not correct. Amaze doesn't change MCC which is what the bonus category is based on.""Online"" is the method.",btohqsg
You need to read this to understand more‚Ä¶https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/ladys-cards-tcs.pdf,btohqsg
Just to ask  is it better wipe off CPF OA to reduce the HDB monthly payment or use the OA investment like S&P.,btohqsg
calculate the interest save compare to low down payment,btohqsg
Uob salary credit must be by 23 aug?,btohqsg

tomorrow got one last month right,btohqsg
Hi guys my HSBC Rev rewards earning is capped at $1k/month. I have 2x air tickets to buy that cost $2k+. Can I earn the full 10x if I split the purchase on 31 Aug and 1 Sep?,btohqsg

Should be much earlier for 1st transaction as it take few days to be posted.,btohqsg
