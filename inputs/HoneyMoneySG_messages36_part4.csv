Can I did it so many times last time like a few months ago. But now grabPay card is dirt shit. Spending in Malaysia would say best to use Amaze > Citi Rewards. Above that limit  perhaps Revolut or Trust Credit/ Debit card.,btohqsg
Best to also check against general exclusion mcc for all Citi cards:https://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/Rewards_Exclusion_List.pdf,btohqsg
You may want to consider amaze>Citi for most spending  except for usual mcc exclusion for Citi cards. Then HSBC Revolution for travel related expenseUtilities and bills related  have to find cards with no limit spend  like SC smart card. Some use UOB one for all spend but that‚Äôs the CB game and requires constant spending for 3 consecutive quarters ü§£,btohqsg
Can also shuffle travel expenses to DBS woman‚Äôs card right?,btohqsg

paynow is funded by bank acct not cc. qr nothing to do with cardup. grab qr need to topup grab  only 1.5% on amex tcb which will be nerfed wef 4apr then left 0.3% on uob amex absolute,btohqsg
