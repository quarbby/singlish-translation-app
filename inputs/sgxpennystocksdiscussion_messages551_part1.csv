leaders and news all say covid like flu.. mild or no symptoms when kena if vaccinated. my colleague's family all kena covid. he's 42  perfectly healthy  fully vaxxed. he say it's the worst ever flu if govt consider it a flu. more than 3 days 40 deg fever  throat on fire macham like blow torch  and that to the govt is considered mild symptoms.. not-mild = heart palpitations  chest pain those kind.,btohqsg
recently news channels on social media starting to have interviews of people who kena covid and those people who were interviewed all macham no or mild symptoms...sounds like the whole plot directed by somebody trying to drive home the point that covid is like a normal flu,btohqsg
My nephew now still coughing n chest pain..,btohqsg
