Are there any benefit topup and use shoppe pay?,btohqsg
Probably just to use their vouchers...,btohqsg
Hi Guys. May i ask  is there any benefit if i pay my SP bills through axs via the grab mastercard?,btohqsg
you benefit via the Grab topup,btohqsg
the 1.5% or 1.7% cashback from your Amex truecashback card  or the UOB Absolute Cashback card,btohqsg
Actually it is 1.5%/1.7% + 1.2%,btohqsg
Grab still rewards points for payment to SP,btohqsg
which I don't think will last long... usually utility bills should be excluded,btohqsg
oh? didn't know u can make direct payment to SP (i use geneco),btohqsg
AXS payments don't qualify for 1.2% cashback (in GrabRewards Points) so... no point using AXS if can make payment directly with GrabPay,btohqsg
yes  you can do so on SP mobile app,btohqsg
quite convenient and earns you extra points,btohqsg
Then pay up front first before it ends,btohqsg
haha yes  I pay my SP bills as soon as they're out,btohqsg
I paid a year ahead üòÜ to meet citipayall,btohqsg
I guess he overpaid thus leaving funds in his SP account.,btohqsg
Hi for the Amaze card  is there any minimum spending in order to get cash back?,btohqsg
to get the $10 sign up bonus can top up grab to fulfil criteria?,btohqsg
But you won't get it instantly   took me a few days,btohqsg
Just follow the steps laid out üëç,btohqsg
Hi. If I don't use grab for traveling  is it still worth it to try for the amex +grab cashback strategy for other grab pay expenses?My monthly expenses about $800 only.,btohqsg
Definitely have better cards like OCBC365.. can't think off my head but surely have better cards for these,btohqsg
Hi All  I've never gotten a Credit Card. So looking into getting one But unsure because there's many CC... Really Confusing. So hoping someone can recommend me one.Most of my stuffs i bought online i top up in Grab and i pay by Grab. So i have tons of points. like 300k+Usually take more MRT and Bus for Travelling. Also i want a card that i can pay anytime for example:Watching Movies  Dinner and Other stuffs Grand total of $300-400. Can i pay it an hour later? Instead of waiting for statement?My Min spend and bills paying is always 1k every month.,btohqsg
I think you can only pay after statement comes out  but I always refer tohttps://milelion.com/credit-cards/guide/to help me decide,btohqsg
So based on your spending behaviour you can match with the cards listed there,btohqsg
The simpler one should be thishttps://www.pzl.sg/blog/which-credit-cards-do-i-have-singapore/,btohqsg
Out of the two Cashback Cards which one would you choose? I realised American Express wrote Topup Grabpay wallet.,btohqsg
For cashback I usually find the simple one like UOB Evol (if u spend 600/month) or OCBC FRANK (if u spend 833/month),btohqsg
If the transaction not eligible for those two cards  I use grabpay + amex,btohqsg
Are these 2 Cards Okay for Grabpay? Like most of the time i will use Grabpay and top up.,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt that‚Äôs why use amex to topup grabpay  but if u see the cashback for evol is around 6.7% and frank is 6% so higher,btohqsg
So I don‚Äôt see why you should use grabpay for transaction that eligible for evol or frank cashback,btohqsg
You can use this video to decide toohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saqSEuA-usw,btohqsg
Just sharing information. You can consider using the NS55 Credits in your LifeSG app to perform top-ups to your special / retirement account (if you're 55 and above) under the Retirement Sum Topping-up Scheme.,btohqsg
Use at NS55 at Cold Storage and get $5 discount 9% rebate also not bad.,btohqsg
i just use the NS55 to top up my cpf SA via paynow... inspired by honey money... ü§£,btohqsg
shld have make better use. Example fairprice  frasermall etc have extra %.,btohqsg
NS55 credits can transfer to bank accounthttps://blog.seedly.sg/convert-ns55-credits-cash/,btohqsg
ehh mine still not in leh why ah,btohqsg
Hi all  any idea what combination should I use for heavy monthly insurance payment for both cashback and miles? Amex and grabpay? I was thinking if can combine other cashback or miles reward cards with instarem excluding dbs cards since dbs exclude instarem.,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I've watched the Vid. If you were to choose between American Express True Cashback & UOB Absolute AMEX  Which one would you pick? I'm always topping up on GrabPay,btohqsg
the difference is really small  just pick the bank you'd like to deal with (which is quite obvious in my opinion),btohqsg
Amex service is good  I never tried UOB yet,btohqsg
Get amex first for signup reward plus 3% on first $5000,btohqsg
Actually never tried any other banks except dbs/posb.,btohqsg
For gift redemption from moneysmart I already spent $500 within the 30days period. Do I wait for the bank to update moneysmart or it will only be valid after I made the payments? Btw how do I check payments for credit card like the due date.,btohqsg
Quick question: Is it worth it to paywave RM400 (exclusive of conversion fee)?If yes  CB cashback+ or HSBC Revo is a better choice?,btohqsg
Hello peeps any referral code for simply go app?,btohqsg
Why was I charged CCY conversion fee for a transaction in SGD??,btohqsg
