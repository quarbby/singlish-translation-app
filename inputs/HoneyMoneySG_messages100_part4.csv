No need  cash plus is custodian,btohqsg
Hi all  need an advice. I am running csp on Webull. My money is tied inside. Can I put the money in moneybull to earn interest? If can  shd I do it? Any downside?,btohqsg
Can I transfer the stocks from etrade to POEMS? If yes  will the stocks value be counted for the first 10k?,btohqsg
Has anyone used a DSC card? Looking at the 2% card ultimate platinum card? Looking to use it for some big ticket item renovations next month,btohqsg
Worked for me amaze + crmc,btohqsg
Ok not sure why mine dont work. Im at china   have errors on payment.,btohqsg
It happens sometimes. You just got to wait a while and try again. Or switch to wechat pay.,btohqsg
U need to transfer in 2k,btohqsg
Chinese transactions are marked by banks as suspicious. When the ending merchant like didi or major brands restaurants charge  mostly will go through. But because each Alipay wallet can be linked to some weird entity the banks block it. For eg. every time I go China I have to message trust bank support to white list my transactions for the period travelled.Still sometimes it gets blocked  most of the time Alipay ones work more than WeChat ones though,btohqsg
It happened to me Shanghai. Had to message trust support to unlock my card. To give credit  they responded promptly.,btohqsg
Shanghai story seems familiar. There was one time in Shanghai ‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
I suggest to have WeChat pay and Alipay setup. Each app have 2 credit cards linked. You don‚Äôt really need to use cash. In fact  the locals will find it strange if you use cash,btohqsg
Ok  I had just received too. Thanks,btohqsg
But if you rotate the funds between 2 accounts  then how will the giro work? There won't be any funds for giro deduction for the other bank's credit card bills  tax  etc.,btohqsg
Just 1 main for giro purpose  one for incremental interest,btohqsg
You just basically have to pay the account for the giro bills.,btohqsg
I am just not sure whether rotate per 2 month better or per month works better,btohqsg
Oh I see. So just maintain 2k,btohqsg
Yes although some say dont need maintain just i just keep 2k inside all the time,btohqsg
Any recommendation for miles card usage on Agoda and Cruise lines?,btohqsg
Check which bank give most discount on your agoda booking first then choose the card from that bank,btohqsg
Must maintain 2k as minimum deposit. They will charge u fall below fee,btohqsg
Cruise line can try dbs wwmc if online  uob lady/solitaire travel cat  uob vs or uob ppv if can mobile contactless,btohqsg
BTW did u guys already see hsbc ega may and Jun program?,btohqsg
When going to JB  which CC do u use to get the best miles clocking for spend?,btohqsg
I use amaze plus citi reward,btohqsg
I only see April interest. Not really into may period at all... actually if u don't move the funds at all you basically keep getting 3.6%?,btohqsg
Coz if u participate early promo  u cant join the next promo that why u need to merry go round,btohqsg
Any promo for UOB lady‚Äôs this month?,btohqsg
Forgot the figure. Didn‚Äôt matter to me I kiasu opened on first day announced 28th March I think.,btohqsg
I think is from 5 apr,btohqsg
I mean I opened before the promo announcement.I opened when the bonus mpd from savings account was announced.I will get nothing.,btohqsg
Yes u are right. So if 2 human account: Human A joined mar/apr promotion then rotate the fund via another bank to human B for Apr/May promotion is the best?,btohqsg
Exactly. That‚Äôs the highest level play,btohqsg
And if u are able to do this. U can say bye bye to Uob one earmark promo which is only 4.44% for 4.5 months lock in (lousier).Empty Uob one and wait for next plunging chicken promo.,btohqsg
Wah this is rotating per single month this time.,btohqsg
But max $360k. Hence I made this statement.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/172910,btohqsg
Good for high saver  i small saver so i opt for uob stash earmark haha,btohqsg
Just the interest only pay Jun or Jul so we only know if it works 4.6%? U got the previous interest worked well? Wah per month shift is quite fast,btohqsg
Agar agar la due to day count.Even Uob one isn‚Äôt 5% pa exactly.They usually use 5% / 365 x calendar days.,btohqsg
any promo code for dbs woman's world,btohqsg
Wah means if he 360k each month rotate gets 4.6%. What else need to do like 5 transaction...,btohqsg
I do $15k in and 5 fast out.,btohqsg
Originally I thought just shift per 2 months but second month is lower,btohqsg
