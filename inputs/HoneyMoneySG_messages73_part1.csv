Hi friends  im new to the credit card scene.If I intend to apply for UOB One credit card just to use it solely for SP Services bill that amounts to around $700 per month  would that work and qualify for the min spend?,btohqsg
That one is ofc assuming it's under the mcc hahahaha cos the person was asking about electronics,btohqsg
Electronics not under uob krisflyer mcc for online shopping i think,btohqsg
Uob krisflyer online shopping mainly refer to fashion website,btohqsg
It is listed on website that stated it include fashion website as online shopping but not exact mcc stated in tnc. So spend at your own discretion. Plus the bonus point only come in after 1 year which is after annual fee and i have very bad experience with this card and annual fee cant be waive,btohqsg
Hey gurus  I am holding the citi rewards card  uob one  and uob solitaire lady card. For paying of big purchases like furniture's and paying of bills/income tax/insurances. What is the best option here on which card to use. Do I need to get a separate card for that?,btohqsg
Do you guys think it is wise to only have 1 CC? Currently using hsbc revolution miles card.Or should I have another cashback card?I recently got a huge pay bump but i do not forsee inflating my lifestyle,btohqsg
do u not have spending that dun get bonus points on the hsbc revolution?,btohqsg
Having more cc‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt lead to lifestyle inflation. Lack of self control does.,btohqsg
Currently im just using almost everything on it for the sake of it,btohqsg
I think its time to optimize..Worried i cannot hit the minimum spendings,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre using it for almost everything  high chance some of them don‚Äôt qualify for 10X.,btohqsg
Then yes  even a dumb 1.5% cashback card is better than 1X points. Your lifestyle doesn‚Äôt need to inflate  your headache might trying to remember which card to use though .üòÇ,btohqsg
Cmrc amaze would be good w revolution,btohqsg
Revol covers the travel part and cmrc amaze almost anything other than travel spends,btohqsg
I'll need to go back to the drawing block and find out the merchants etc.What is 'cmrc'?,btohqsg
you mean CRMC? citi rewards mc,btohqsg
Yess pair with amaze for almost any transaction. Hsbc to supplement it,btohqsg
cheers  i gotta read up on this pairing thing,btohqsg
Just link cmrc to amaze in app and use amaze card. Anyway revo and cmrc no min spend just have cap at 1k for bonus points,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI am thinking of redeeming 30k Sept SSB  keep in CIMB 3.5% till end Dec  then put in Jan SSB (3.39% forecast). This comparison is against DecSSB bcos JanSSB graph not available yet. Could I trouble Chris or SSB experts to help check whether worthwhile thanks,btohqsg
I am primarily using UOB One for my daily expenses - solely for the purpose of getting the high interest for the 100k parked in UOB One account. Otherwise  I use Lady Card for Dining and buying air tickets and hotels booking. For spending when overseas  low cost items I use Trust Card for better exchange rates  but for big tickets items like luxury clothes bags shoes when overseas  I use UOB privilege miles. Realised that I use mostly UOB cards üòÇ,btohqsg
damn  that issa lotta cards hahaha. Let me start with 2 üòÅ,btohqsg
The 365 sign up link is broken? Can't seem to access it from my phone,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know why when overseas I use UOB privilege miles for big tickets items ‚Ä¶ may be I should just use Trust for all things overseas when paying in foreign currencies‚Ä¶..,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the problem when u ask the question you asked. üòÇ  I don‚Äôt give a shit about cashback honestly cause the amount is too immaterial. Therefore I focus on miles to help me do upgrades when I fly.,btohqsg
"I saw this comment on reddit  would this be true to any extent?""The crucial issue is  the fees for transferring your points to miles. Essentially sets you back -$26.75. I actually think a good Cashback card can completely cover your flights (long or short haul). You get the flexibility as well.""",btohqsg
Wait until he finds out that taxes and fuel levies cannot be redeemed by miles as well. üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes  if you spend the correct amount using the correct method  such as UoB evol or dbs live fresh  you will get $40/ mth with 600 or $800 spend,btohqsg
Yeah  but is so much hassle‚Ä¶ i can‚Äôt track online spending or contactless spending etc. Wa Hin lo üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
Yes  that‚Äôs why I shift to lady card now,btohqsg
theres so much meta to this CC game haha. I'm new so it is overwhelming,btohqsg
Is there a tool or website or app that can show history of US stocks that I want to see/monitor in term of the daily volume buy and sell? Instead of manually go to one by one stock to check,btohqsg
what is ur categoriesfor UOB Lady card ?,btohqsg
I am asking cause I think best to select those categories re. big ticket items like travel  dining and Fashion.,btohqsg
personally i think the same way too. But alot of this things really depends on your personal habit   like spending expenditure   what you spend on etc,btohqsg
Understood  I personally dont spend alot yet. Most of my transactions are from shengsiong lol,btohqsg
if your spending is like mine   300$ on online and 300$ contacless than evol  is the best,btohqsg
almost something like that tbh  I'll check evol out,btohqsg
evol cashback is 8% but the cap per month on each category is like 20$    so you can spend 250 for contacless and 350 for online   or vice versa,btohqsg
My first step is to figure out how and where im spending money,btohqsg
