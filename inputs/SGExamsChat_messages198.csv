H2 math is too diluted tbh,btohqsg
Hahaha. Just make it university style! The way to go!,btohqsg
It does more harm only when it is so diluted,btohqsg
Makes h2 math seems like an ant,btohqsg
No  makes it seem like a complete joke that people even have the audacity to teach incorrect stuff,btohqsg
There isnt rly any incorrect stuff taught,btohqsg
The incorrect stuff taught is in chem,btohqsg
So you're telling me that horizontal line test to prove injectivity is correct?,btohqsg
Eh i nvr learn that so i cant comment,btohqsg
No  anything not pure  we say it is something else. Corrupted hahaha,btohqsg
Why they cant teach completely correct,btohqsg
Pure math is easier than the above tbh,btohqsg
Of course. Then why did you choose not to do pure mathematics? It's your choice,btohqsg
Not everyone as smart as you,btohqsg
Don't just think from your own point of view,btohqsg
How I wish I was as clever asV. The reality is that I am not clever. 😢,btohqsg
h2 math is like the o lvl equivalent of emaths,btohqsg
H2 math is more computation than theory,btohqsg
Then what was the O level equivalent of A maths for examination years2007-2016?,btohqsg
I hated amathsBut found h2 maths relatively manageable,btohqsg
But still screw up part of my p1 in the end 🤧,btohqsg
H2 math cant help you much in uni math for sure.,btohqsg
I think only the H3 university modules may be able help  at least initially,btohqsg
f maths  come on  what a joke,btohqsg
Idk man  idk how uni math looks like...,btohqsg
Let's do some field extensions! Hahaha,btohqsg
U shld get some friends and go outside,btohqsg
So far how many rp has everyone managed to collect,btohqsg
given the difficulty of yesterday's GP I'm probably around 27.5rp  26.25 if I'm pessimistic,btohqsg
time to see how far I can bring my H2s,btohqsg
Usually people underestimate how they do for A levels,btohqsg
hahah those are realistic estimates but idk if cambridge is lenient  who knows,btohqsg
Given my prelims my 3H2s probably can get BBC assuming I don't study like mad,btohqsg
Moderate amount of studying  not burning midnight oil,btohqsg
H2 FMath is adequate if you are planning to do applied math  stats or engineering,btohqsg
But not if u want to do pure math,btohqsg
But H3 math also not very helpful in uni pure math. Besides number theory and combinatories  nothing else,btohqsg
Analysis  Basics of Abstract Algebra all not in A lvl syllabus. The most fundamental of pure maths,btohqsg
D first poem gay no cap,btohqsg
I did the first poem lol,btohqsg
Do send the chem p2 too if u have it on thurs,btohqsg
But i doubt any1 will have,btohqsg
I know math tutor who will have the paper.,btohqsg
A math tutor send it to me.,btohqsg
The one who post the ans online?,btohqsg
History paper gonna be hard too,btohqsg
hi does anyone know what's the usual a level bell curve score for A in H2 math,btohqsg
Anyways chill P2 isn't over yet,btohqsg
The ap gp qn is a joke lol,btohqsg
Yes normally its application qns tested,btohqsg
They are just giving the numbers and we just have to plug them into the formulas,btohqsg
Easy marks if u know the formulas,btohqsg
I thought Ong Ye Kung say no more bell curve,btohqsg
O level chat. You know  people from I think India,btohqsg
I think they are speaking Hindi,btohqsg
I said it once and I do not need to repeat my words,btohqsg
I said it once and I do not need to repeat my words,btohqsg
Why they asking only person A,btohqsg
then the other one replied not asking person A then asking person B ah,btohqsg
Some people from India joined the O level chat and started talking in Hindi,btohqsg
Anybody know what’s the bellcurve like for pure literature at o levels?,btohqsg
I thought that there is no bellcurve for O levels?,btohqsg
I really don’t get why ppl insist that there is a bell curve even though the media alrd stared that there is not.,btohqsg
But roughly what’s the grade for A2,btohqsg
Then why did you use the word bellcurve?,btohqsg
The media can’t be trusted for absolutely everything so you see the conundrum 😬,btohqsg
So the ministry of education is giving false claims?,btohqsg
i think they just dont use percentile for grades,btohqsg
but they use marks instead but they set the grades at certain marks,btohqsg
so technically still using the “bell curve”,btohqsg
But those marks depend upon the performance of the cohort,btohqsg
Otherwise what if nobody meets the A1 grade because the paper dang difficult,btohqsg
they said like it will naturally be a curve in the article so like central limit theorem lols,btohqsg
Bell curve is forcing everyone into a distribution,btohqsg
Especially if they set a high grade for A1,btohqsg
Way less than 15-20% of the cohort,btohqsg
for o levels or a a’s,btohqsg
the only national exam that kind of functions like a bell curve is PSLE,btohqsg
But MOE claims that PSLE doesn't use a curve,btohqsg
or a similar formula to z scores,btohqsg
So the grade for A1/A2 at o levels,btohqsg
t score df=infinity is essentially z scores,btohqsg
And dependent upon the performance of the cohort,btohqsg
this one only affect a bit la,btohqsg
so assume Pure chem o level usually need 78 minimum for A1,btohqsg
lets say this year a lot of ppl do extremely well,btohqsg
at most A1 shift to 80,btohqsg
So SEAB has the grades fixed,btohqsg
But it fluctuates slightly according to the cohort,btohqsg
they essentially play a game of russian roulette every year,btohqsg
Doesn't sound like fixed to me,btohqsg
Anyways  everyone doesn't know their raw scores,btohqsg
If you get 100% you aren't going to get a reward,btohqsg
Really? Wouldnt thinking too much make it worse,btohqsg
I think it makes you more anxious,btohqsg
if u wanna experience what a bell curve truly is,btohqsg
some ppl the last As they see in school is in sec sch/jc,btohqsg
You sound like you will get L1R5 raw 6,btohqsg
and after that in poly/uni  gettin an A is like god tier level alr,btohqsg
Even suma cum laude might not get A?,btohqsg
Like some people on honours role won’t get A,btohqsg
u pit 100 A graders in H2 A lvl chemistry  in a uni chemistry course,btohqsg
only 25 out of 100 will get A- and above,btohqsg
the rest will get B+ and below,btohqsg
the same can be applied to almost all other courses,btohqsg
anyone know what grading is like for dnt,btohqsg
Idk my sec school classmates that take it say hard get A,btohqsg
if u submit all 3 components isit guaranteed pass,btohqsg
even if u screw up theory,btohqsg
like i submit journal and presentation board,btohqsg
oh thats 60% then theory 40,btohqsg
the marks for artefact is removed,btohqsg
if i did badly for theory,btohqsg
if ur journal n p-board did well then mught help bah,btohqsg
Mcq is on 12 november right,btohqsg
any tips for speaking confidently wif expression for op,btohqsg
Just forget about the gravity of the situation,btohqsg
That way you won’t succumb to nervousness,btohqsg
i think they changed it to,btohqsg
idk what seab doing anyways but i heard its called criteria based marking,btohqsg
I think there will be  because people will still insist there is a bell curve,btohqsg
Because he isn't a sec5 kid anymore,btohqsg
u made me go 'bedok bedok' for 5 secs there,btohqsg
My heart goes bedok bedok as well 😍😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,btohqsg
ready to start ur HBL H2 Chem learning soon?,btohqsg
Paper 1 is over and looking ahead at Paper 2  you might want to focus on the following Pure Maths topics1) Functions2) Volume4) Inequalities and Equations5) Transformations  Deduced Graphs and Conics6) Summation & MOD7) rates of change (application of differentiation)8) Parametric equations.^ from my sch,btohqsg
Bedok is no longer Sec 5 kid,btohqsg
Anybody here grinding literature at the last minute,btohqsg
Guys what to do after o level,btohqsg
Or if u want study the subjects u think u gonna take at the As,btohqsg
How to study if u know ur gonna fail anyway no matter what,btohqsg
Don’t study lah. Start to find work to earn money,btohqsg
How to start when I dont even have any preexisting funds,btohqsg
Unemployment rate so high. We are in a recession. Who tf wants to hire a no skilled secondary school student,btohqsg
work part time for a bookshop,btohqsg
Imagine bulk buying iphone 12s and apple comes out with the iphone 13 the day after,btohqsg
I need preexisting funds to do that  but I dont. Unfortunately  I dont think banks want to loan money now especially to someone without collateral and cannot guarantee they can pay off interest,btohqsg
Unfortunately I dont own my house,btohqsg
Sell the air u breathe out,btohqsg
I'm probably gonna sell them after Os but I doubt that can raise much,btohqsg
Sure why not. Maybe it's better that it ends,btohqsg
lol the sch ask me donate,btohqsg
I don't think anyone wants to buy carbon dioxide,btohqsg
Just hire agency if ur desperate,btohqsg
They will help u find job,btohqsg
im still getting a lot of wrong fml,btohqsg
wishing good days to you all,btohqsg
hii whats the bell curve for chem?,btohqsg
Can only say after the paper,btohqsg
U talking abt H2 chem right?,btohqsg
eh lose 10 marks for p2 considering i did well for prac and if i do well for mcq,btohqsg
about 78 for A1 if that’s what ur asking,btohqsg
Theres a group chat for that,btohqsg
anyone here got nominated for psc scholarship psychometric exercise?,btohqsg
Just when weather station said first 2 weeks of Nov is hot and sunny... And it floods...,btohqsg
I mean let's not even talk about scholarships anymore... 70rp can go FASS?,btohqsg
More warm days in the first two weeks of November: Met Service - TODAYonlinehttps://www.todayonline.com/singapore/more-warm-days-first-two-weeks-november-met-service,btohqsg
I'm wrapped in a jacket for the lit paper later❄,btohqsg
my cher printed mcq from yr2000-2019,btohqsg
HAHAHA well... bell curve god...  uhh...,btohqsg
I hope my senior do well in his chem tmr,btohqsg
He probably gave up on chem cuz of this,btohqsg
Your sacrifices shall not be in vain,btohqsg
i thought alr thought earlier in the year,btohqsg
Erm idk i infer that the students prob dk the content yet,btohqsg
But right the role of Fe ions thing there nt tested LOL,btohqsg
Actually it's just about same state or different staye,btohqsg
Isn't really much to be taught,btohqsg
Haha as in meaning udh to memorise those eqns ma,btohqsg
Cos the msg that whoever sent,btohqsg
Those can actually do on the spot with half eqn,btohqsg
Actually why ah. Other than the fact they lower Ea?,btohqsg
Atb for chem ppr tmr kiddos,btohqsg

i bought the glm physics book,btohqsg
but my friend says its combined physics,btohqsg
his is conceptual learning science physics,btohqsg
There's a separate one for combined I think,btohqsg
Or you can check syllabus document,btohqsg
Bro lmfao u bought combined physics,btohqsg
Proceeds to tell me how science physics is pure physics lop,btohqsg
oof rip i bought pure physics,btohqsg
holy shit its worse than my sch's physics department,btohqsg
ours didnt teach my snrs a whole topic before prelims,btohqsg
Then hiw to know if u are ready for it,btohqsg
idk i dont take physics haha,btohqsg
but my whole snr batch were taking turns to shit on their situation HAHA,btohqsg
Yall think the states will turn blue?,btohqsg
i think trump won this time,btohqsg
Content for combined sci is all in the pure sci book,btohqsg
idt michigan  pennsylvania and north carolina will turn blue,btohqsg
A couple hasn't reported 70% yet,btohqsg
You all are studying for MCQ already,btohqsg
"Some people still have regular tests this week :""(",btohqsg
Be happy if I can get a B3,btohqsg
do more than 24 hr yes lets go,btohqsg
remember not to help florida and texas when they have hurricanes and shit,btohqsg
Then let's hope it doesn't happen again,btohqsg
florida texas and ohio are key states,btohqsg
florida got a lot of electoral votes,btohqsg
WI is turning from red to blue,btohqsg
There are a lot of mail-ins not counted yet,btohqsg
wi is not a key state,btohqsg
i’m talking about the four states i mentioned,btohqsg
Why are you talking about the decided ones,btohqsg
texas and florida residents can ask trump for help the next time they experience disasters,btohqsg
bc the rest are “too early to say.”,btohqsg
i just want to know who wins,btohqsg
But i dont want him win,btohqsg
Likely will go to court though,btohqsg
Biden wouldn't do much himself. As delusional as trump is  he gets more done. I'm pro trump haha,btohqsg
i feel like people who support biden are more anti-trump instead of pro-biden,btohqsg
they don’t have a better choice,btohqsg
Honestly I'm pretty indifferent to it  but I like watching reactions,btohqsg
if im an american citizen i’d vote for biden simply bc im anti-trump,btohqsg
The middle east stuff I guess,btohqsg
That's what democracy is about xD,btohqsg
he did not make usa a safer place,btohqsg
thank you i don’t live in usa anyway,btohqsg
america basically fuck it self over,btohqsg
don’t have to care much about this,btohqsg
thru all the crying and protest,btohqsg
i think chinese people would rather trump win,btohqsg
since biden winning wouldn’t help us-china ties,btohqsg
"got a lot of ppl i know vote for trump just to ""piss off liberals and feminazis""",btohqsg
which is think is stupid as hell,btohqsg
Penn still has a ton of mail-ins not counted yet,btohqsg
china would prefer to see usa to he in chaos,btohqsg
and they wonder why their country is like that,btohqsg
voting for people like kanye is dumb as well,btohqsg
yeah my china friend say vote trump cuz they wanna see usa go down,btohqsg
a vote for kanye = a vote for trump thh,btohqsg
the elections are a movie and we’re just viewers,btohqsg
when BLM happened my china friends damn happy  grab popcorn celebrate,btohqsg
prob gonna have more chaos if trump wins,btohqsg
mmm bad to think that way but yeah normal,btohqsg
if he loses it’ll probably be chaotic,btohqsg
idk if he can admit defeat,btohqsg
i think both ways america gg,btohqsg
which is gud cuz i no liek murica,btohqsg
they do a lot of fucked up shit then claim russia chna middle east worst then them when they're the same,btohqsg
some say japan may be more in favour towards china as compared to usa even,btohqsg
Biden will never flip other states,btohqsg
hong kong protests but they themselves..,btohqsg
im sorry but usa is a fucking mess,btohqsg
americans dont care about what foreigners think tho,btohqsg
why would anyone side w usa now,btohqsg
"jn i was arguing w some murican they say ""gay marriage illegal ur country suck""",btohqsg
im like LOL look at your own country,btohqsg
the reason we have no covid is cuz everything is illegal,btohqsg
He can never flip those states,btohqsg
Basically set in stone now wait for him to re-elect and for everyone to abandon America,btohqsg
Most hopping ship to China already,btohqsg
but they’re probably homophobic too.. the irony,btohqsg
Ok idk if I can say this here  a rep said that abortion is illegal even if the baby is from a rape incident,btohqsg
most republicans are conservative and homophobic,btohqsg
He needs to get one more to win,btohqsg
weird that they use that as an argument,btohqsg
Then I sit there and stare,btohqsg
And then walk away from Twitter,btohqsg
he took all the key states,btohqsg
but i think american republicans not has hardcore as eastern europe white supremacists,btohqsg
Yes assuming he has 238  NV and WI,btohqsg
If trump wins we can see this again,btohqsg
and he flipped none after that,btohqsg
So he needs one of PA  GA and NC,btohqsg
i think usa still is the most tho,btohqsg
I hope ya prove me wrong V,btohqsg
Might need a few more days to finish counting,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to interpret the election reuslt,btohqsg
He just needs one more out of the 3,btohqsg
Each state has a certain no,btohqsg
Oh  so he more likely to wi,btohqsg
Biden but I think trump will win,btohqsg
I saw a news they say trump declare himself as winner alr,btohqsg
He needs 1 more which is almost impossible to get at this point,btohqsg
Talk a lot that one man,btohqsg
even ben shapiro against him now,btohqsg
So when will the final result be out ah,btohqsg
If he flip another state that is ga or nc then got chance,btohqsg
Pen no hope so can only hope for GA and NC,btohqsg
So now things are not looking too bright for Biden so I am saying Biden might not win,btohqsg
each state got a certain no of those votes,btohqsg
Each state has its own number of electoral votes,btohqsg
so biden won cali so he adds 55 votes to his score or whatever,btohqsg
U sure? It's still at 70%,btohqsg
so Biden add to 270 and wins,btohqsg
Penny is a known rep state,btohqsg
Except Arkansas is a clear for him as it is the home state of the KKK,btohqsg
They were blue all the way before 2016,btohqsg
As in they already can go red already,btohqsg
can call it red already now,btohqsg
I have a feeling BIden will flip NC and Georgia at the last second,btohqsg
Penn is the slowest counting state,btohqsg
Some people placing bets on Biden,btohqsg
Then Trump will contest the results,btohqsg
it was reported he bet Biden,btohqsg
Ya he said he will contest if it doesn't go for me like they said,btohqsg
One singing kpop on mothership instagram,btohqsg
He won't let go that position that easily it is like his life line now,btohqsg
He has 900 million in dept,btohqsg
I mean 1 billion or something it was reported if he not president he needs to pay back all,btohqsg
Like no protection in a way,btohqsg
So he will contest one bah,btohqsg
It affevts u more than US,btohqsg
i dont even know about anything that happened last sg elections,btohqsg
Sarcasm notice it come on now,btohqsg
relative to us yeah u can say that i guess,btohqsg
Hahahaha nvm ull grow out of it once u grow up,btohqsg
Eat maggi spicy and ice cream,btohqsg
Spicy maggi and ice cream only,btohqsg
Kamala Harris is gonna bring USA to ruin,btohqsg
Too bad Biden will win first,btohqsg
Besides trump really isn’t that horrible,btohqsg
I’m really hoping Biden doesn’t win though,btohqsg
I cannot imagine him and Harris ruling the USA,btohqsg
I cannot imagine China going on a rampage if he wins however that won't matter since Biden is going to win!,btohqsg
The one with the gay kid,btohqsg
Annie? This is beetlejuicing at it's finest,btohqsg
Oh  one of the characters in Community is named Annie,btohqsg
I expect biden to win everyth if he wins wisconsin,btohqsg
Cause itll show mail ballots are majority blue,btohqsg
im just worried that Trump wont admit defeat,btohqsg
But what can he do HAHAH,btohqsg
Yeah they prob ask him get lost,btohqsg
He going to the supreme court!,btohqsg
And be arrested i hope lmao,btohqsg
Probably going to shoo him away,btohqsg
This one if dk then how,btohqsg
aiya poly will auto defer for u,btohqsg
So dont submit first or what,btohqsg
I received mine at 17 oso,btohqsg
but if u scared den u call them and ask ah,btohqsg
I from jc also but i got mine when i 19,btohqsg
I dk what poly i going yet,btohqsg
Unless if you can get Pes C,btohqsg
If so then I applaud you,btohqsg
I haven’t even served NS yet lol,btohqsg
I dont think they will let me go ns next year anyway,btohqsg
September 2003... You sort of missed the fun of living through SARS,btohqsg
I mean at leaat he got to live through covid-19 👀,btohqsg
Hi shld i memorise everything in j1 to prepare for j2?,btohqsg
Maybe do prelim papers? For those questions that you have learnt the content,btohqsg
Memorising alone isn't very helpful. Doing the papers are very helpful,btohqsg
^ yeah  practicing applying that knowledge instead of remembering static info,btohqsg
Memorise + practice how to use what u memorised 👉🏻👈🏻 which is technically applying,btohqsg
U literally cant go far without memory too,btohqsg
Yes  he can also compile everything into succint notes. That would be useful for his A level and prelim papers,btohqsg
I guessss 👀 HAHAH people usually fail tho,btohqsg
Ah yes I compile very badly..........I'll try tho haha,btohqsg
Because the lecture notes are very long winded. Very bad for revision,btohqsg
Agreed 👀 theres this small green/blue book thats alw raved abt for org,btohqsg
For organic just draw ur own mindmaps,btohqsg
Biden is on the way to winning,btohqsg
Same thing happened to Clinton too,btohqsg
so let's wait till it's over,btohqsg
Why? I'll be devastated if Biden wins,btohqsg
One will be just few votes away from win and the other just wins it. 😂 so near yet so far,btohqsg
Strong and daring leader. Come on  look at Biden  he is so weak  speaks so softly.,btohqsg
And I like some of his policies,btohqsg
Many leaders do not look up to Trump,btohqsg
tbh it’s between the devil and the big blue sea,btohqsg
I like trump cos he is unconventional and enterprenuerial,btohqsg
He brings sth unusual to the political table,btohqsg
both biden nd trump aso not v good,btohqsg
Many do. The Brazilian president likes him,btohqsg
Actually sg gov accepts any other leaders,btohqsg
"does ""entrepreneurial"" includepaying $750 in taxes",btohqsg
Idt sg likes him a lot after that tbf,btohqsg
lol apparently trump evades taxes nd ppl support him for it,btohqsg
ya LOL trump or biden we'lll still support US,btohqsg
His family has a trait of not paying taxes la,btohqsg
No. I think sg dun pick,btohqsg
tiffany you like trump cuz its like bringing a braindead to a reality tv show and its entertaining?,btohqsg
Imagine trying to be anti-China while borrowing money from chinese banks,btohqsg
> record high covid cases & deaths> trump: declares victory over covid,btohqsg
