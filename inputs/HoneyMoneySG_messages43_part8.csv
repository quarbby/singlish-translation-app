Most people invest in S&P 500 ETFs and not NASDAQ 100 ETFs although the latter has muchhhh higher return over the long term (despite high expense ratio). Any thoughts why?,btohqsg
I tried dbs (quite 2 days or more),btohqsg
I invest in both. Some just prefer a lower risk/volatility index fund. It's all about your risk appetite,btohqsg
Does the t&c of Singsaver/Citi exclude travel spend? (Likely not),btohqsg
Would you mind sharing what your split into either is? 1:1? I‚Äôve been investing in just S&P 500 ETF thinking it would be more or less similar to NASDAQ  until I checked the historic performance.,btohqsg
1/3 each. Refer to DCA video herehttps://youtu.be/mFaTAMXqCOI,btohqsg

Hi there may I know  which of the following card:Amaze + Citi Rewards  HSBC Revolution or Amex Highflyer qualifies points for:Microsoft office License online renewal.Thank you very much,btohqsg
U can check out milelions article on hospital bills as alot of bank cc exclude hospital bill for rebate in term or cashback or miles,btohqsg
If your bill is 9k  it would work best with a low cashback card with no limited like uob absolute 1.7  amex tcb 1.5 (if pay at hospital kiosk)  maybe citibank cash back plus (1.6) on healthhub app if you are looking at 9k bills. It will work out to be more cashback then hsbc as there is no cap,btohqsg
And if payment through app is consider as online you can look at citi smrt card however u have to ask other if healthhub app is consider online or not,btohqsg
Can we split bill using health hub app?,btohqsg
"Actually you should  beside the amount due  there is the amount to pay which allow us to change the amount to pay. I have not tried it  but the ""amount to pay"" is editable. You can try and let us know once confirm.",btohqsg
DP: I realized I have an outstanding small bill  tested splitting the bill pay paying partial amount first then 2nd payment for the balance. Work perfectly fine. So confirmed can split bill,btohqsg

Assume u mean FavePay QR code paymemt at a merchant? Favepay payment at a merchant (payment method : a credit card) is considered as online transaction. I tried using DBS Live Fresh :),btohqsg
It would show u in about 3 to 4 working days. Need time for transaction to be posted and amount to be reflected.,btohqsg
Yup scan fave qr code with the citi smrt/citi rewards visa added as payment methods in the fave app. So confirm will be coded as online transaction ya?,btohqsg
Yes  it would classified as online transaction. Rewards still depends on MCC of the merchant.,btohqsg
Just to share: Can also make multiple payments on M1 and Starhub portals on one (1) bill using different cards :),btohqsg
For healthhub  u can edit the payment amount. Just that you cannot overpay.,btohqsg
For singtel and starhub online bills  u can make multiple payments and also overpay.,btohqsg
Confirm stamp chop. Happy paying bills!,btohqsg
