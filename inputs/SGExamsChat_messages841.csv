Also my poly opened the choice for a 1 yr internship for my school for my batch  this means they got no fyp,btohqsg
Some of my poly friends a bit weird one. Apparently one of them had no internship,btohqsg
But still graduated and came to uni,btohqsg
hey each school got their struggles,btohqsg
"Sorry  not ""friend""  ""someone I know of""",btohqsg
yea  some poly's dont require internships to get diploma,btohqsg
its dependent on what the school has decided for that course or person  its individualistic,btohqsg
i should be saying goodliuck to you for j2 next yr,btohqsg

Gonna last minute study and hope for a miracle 💀,btohqsg
you're basically describing my entire undergrad,btohqsg
it works  just dont expect good gpa lmao,btohqsg
This is my entire 8 year existence from sec 1 to y3,btohqsg
oh at that age i didnt even know what studying meant,btohqsg
i thought read textbook can already,btohqsg
I know it works  I've lived that life. On the fence on all my results  0.5- 1 mark from failure kind,btohqsg
I did not even bring textbooks to school,btohqsg
i dont either  its all under my desk,btohqsg
"Parents had to ask me ""wheres all your books""",btohqsg
its like the meme where sec 1 you bring all your textbooks to and fro school but by the time you reach sec 4 its only a pen,btohqsg
"""how come Didi go school  bag so many books  your bag one journal only""",btohqsg
That's half my classmates  come school..pencil case also don't have,btohqsg
aiya sec school you only need two things,btohqsg
No wait a pencil and calculator,btohqsg
I was the obedient one so I don't do that...,btohqsg
I was obedient all the way until i realised i dont even use the textbooks anyway,btohqsg
I was so obedient  I realise my test papers never needed to be handed up,btohqsg
Bruh my one was oogal and boogal,btohqsg

I spend 30 mins to pack my school bag every day,btohqsg
"Only to go school and mess up your ""packing"" in 5mins",btohqsg
at the start of every year  i wrote down a list of everything i need to bring for every subject and pack according to the list every day,btohqsg
Same except half way through the year I realise my bag has half pieces of paper,btohqsg
That idk where it came from,btohqsg
"When I take it out  realise it's that ""slip"" you were suppose to hand up in January for admin matters",btohqsg
You know those papers the teacher says   tear along dotted line,btohqsg
i usually hand in as soon as possible,btohqsg
so one less thing in my bag,btohqsg
usually if someone forgets its form teacher that forgets not me 🤣,btohqsg
because i wrote down list of homeworks and things to submit,btohqsg
things under desk usually end up in the possession of classmates,btohqsg
the cover page of the workbook is the first to be thrown away,btohqsg

Move along Grab-Uber  something to traumatise the next 10 batches of H2 econs students coming,btohqsg
we all know singtel's the best,btohqsg
hopefully the integration of the change is smooth on user's end i dont think everyone would have the time to transfer phone plans and stuff,btohqsg
im more concerned about their fibre stuff tbh,btohqsg
i completely forgot starhub existed until today tbh,btohqsg
They’ll merge together to destroy shitba💀,btohqsg
If you do the math StarHub shares are down by a lot,btohqsg
ever since simba started making prices even lower than last time,btohqsg
Then StarHub decided to launch eight mobile,btohqsg
But instead lost alot of money by doing So,btohqsg
how do I convert NUS High grades to O-Level grades for use in poly applications?,btohqsg
"m1 has circles lifestarhub has giga & eight mobilesingtel has gomo & heyatuas limited has simbathe only difference is that giga and gomo plans are much pricier than their counterparts (eight mobile & heya)simba's plans and coverage functions similarly to eight mobile and heya because they're known to be more ""affordable"" instead of the ""speedy internet quality""",btohqsg
i don't think it's possible to convert NUS High grades to the normal grading system often used for A/N/O levelscause it makes use of the IP (International Programme) syllabus instead  by completing a 6-year(?) IP education in maybe NUS Hugh for example-- you need to check the various prerequisites firstthis can usually be found in the polytechnic school websites or on the NUS websitelink:NUS High Diploma to Polytechnic Diploma FAQ,btohqsg
Circles is planning to sell of their mvno network since M1 is merging now,btohqsg
I know all about networking because the course Im taking is about cybersecurity and networking ;),btohqsg
I personally think that simba will win big after M1 and StarHub merge because IMDA(Infocomm Media Development Authority)would ask StarHub to keep some bandwidth and give the rest back to them and they’ll reauction the bandwidth from M1 to new players or simba.My speculation is that simba will buy these bandwidths to keep up with SingTel & StarHub but there is another speculation going around that there’s going to be a new network joining into the race but that seems very unlikely.,btohqsg
"ahh  i acknowledge what you said but i don't think there's much to speculate for the time beingeven if there has been plans for a company to buy over an existing project  it doesn't always happen very quickly in singapore (not sure about other countries but i know acquiring company assets and corporations have a more regulated policies process in sg)so learning such information from whatever sources we may hear  read or see  doesn't necessarily mean it will follow through because we never know what goes behind closed doors-- which in this case are the companies involved and the relevant government departmentsi like to think there's a difference with the ""wants"" of desiring something and ""ability"" of ensuring the process runs smoothly to the end  when it comes to different industries or situations because different contexts require different approaches",btohqsg
plus if simba wants to make big  the parent company (Tuas Limited) had to decide on its future prospects,btohqsg
a lot of people i know who use simba & heya (not going to count singtel because everyone around me avoids that telco brand like plague) complains about the lack of connectivity the telco has in many parts of the island,btohqsg
I feel like Tuas limited isn’t giving any investments for simba,btohqsg
you're not wrong  that's why they need to discuss within themselves how they want to arrange Simba's future,btohqsg
The main problem is with Imda,btohqsg
either sell it off completely  attract new investors or just remove it off the market,btohqsg
there isn't a main problem in a lot of things because IMDA may be just one problem which affects more than the rest but you gotta consider everything to make things going,btohqsg
Imda didn’t allow simba to bid for n78 (the fastest band that Singapore allows for 5G) because they were using Huawei 4G / 5G equipment which I personally feel discriminatory,btohqsg
Imda had 300mhz of n78 set for 5G in Singapore initially going for SingTel  Anita (Starhub and M1 merged 5G network) and simba but when TPG (SIMBA) said that they were using Huawei to deploy 5G base stations they barred them from deploying the fastest 5G band,btohqsg
Now they’re stuck with just 10mhz of n1 which will definitely not be enough for singaporeans,btohqsg
"honestly sg wants to play a more ""wait-and-see"" stance when it comes to certain matters which require the government leaders to tread more carefully on thin iceand yes  i disagree with this approach as well but you can't directly say that it's discrimination for IMDA to silently block SIMBA's move in wanting to bid for n78",btohqsg
I think simba’s downfall started after Vodafone Hutch bought over their Australian counterparts,btohqsg
TPG has such a good start tbh,btohqsg
they just played their cards so badly,btohqsg
i know one political reference to this situation,btohqsg
SIMBA has really weird bandwidth assigned to them,btohqsg
LTE B40+B40 also known as (2300Mhz) doesn’t work together from what I’ve learnt,btohqsg
cannot be helped especially since the parent company (Tuas Limited) & government don't seem very keen on providing further support,btohqsg
maybe that's why they say  once bitten  twice shy,btohqsg
Upload speeds will be crappy while download speeds will be good,btohqsg
not very consistent in terms of the internet speed or connectivity outreach  lol,btohqsg
Simba had the chance to reappeal for other bands but they were shy and just let it be,btohqsg
I remember M1’s prime when celcom Axiata used to own them,btohqsg
"tbh  a lot of the telco brands in sg don't really have many ""prime eras"" because they either function based on affordability or* long-standing reputation",btohqsg
wait r we talking abt simba,btohqsg
because i am currently FED UP,btohqsg
specifically yes but generally we're talking about sg telco,btohqsg
with simba in this moment of time,btohqsg
That’s why I switched out :),btohqsg
i am super FED UP right now,btohqsg
i just upgraded to an apple phone,btohqsg
i didnt have issues back when i was using my oppo phone,btohqsg
if it sucks  no matter how affordable it is  don't continue buying,btohqsg
but the moment i input the sim into my new phone,btohqsg
cause simba honestly suits android phones more,btohqsg
Got fed up after I needed to post my assignment and my simba was being unresponsive,btohqsg
iPhones don’t work well with simba,btohqsg
Apple threw them out of the 5G supported page,btohqsg
They’re not officially recognised by Apple anymore,btohqsg
I’ve been living my dream with SingTel now,btohqsg
does anyone else with simba plans experienced not being able to receive incoming calls or even dial sometimes with the signal bars functioning?,btohqsg
I’d personally recommend giga now for iPhones,btohqsg
Or buy M1 sim only 5G plan before M1 merges with StarHub,btohqsg
Both are about the same price but one has free roaming and the other doesn’t,btohqsg
Don’t roam with M1 ever again,btohqsg
not sure about your own budget though,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHA my father learnt that the hard way,btohqsg
I got charged 500 dollars even tho I bought a roaming pack when I went to Qatar last year,btohqsg
M1 4G is going downhill but they’re 5G is insanely fast now,btohqsg
My campus gets about 1Gbps on M1,btohqsg
I mean really good it’s faster than my wifi at home 💀,btohqsg
But in terms of latency it’s not good,btohqsg
It’s even more worse than playing Valorant with SingTel Fibre,btohqsg
Even tho the servers are powered by SingTel they’re ping is horrendous,btohqsg
i dont understand the difference aside from the price,btohqsg
One has 180 Days of validity,btohqsg
Either way circles users will soon get dropped to M1 sim only,btohqsg
Redone will be merged with eight soon,btohqsg

Noticed from the cheap ass proton headlight,btohqsg
Maybe the licensing might be the problem,btohqsg
spending 20 billion at its valuation to shut it is crazy,btohqsg
I meant making it closed source not shutting it dowb,btohqsg
Yeah but they can’t keep using the old fork,btohqsg
i think its value is in the fact it has 66%+ of the market,btohqsg
If they take advantage of the old forks then DOJ will ban them to,btohqsg
It’s been really long since I used chrome,btohqsg
the DOJ is also furthering rules and regulations to ensure google does not monopolize the Ai field,btohqsg
Why would you want to stop people from using a fork of an open source project?,btohqsg
I would think they would stop those wanting to prevent people from forking or using chromium,btohqsg
internet explorer has stopped being supported,btohqsg
What I’m trying to say is that the new owners will stop giving the fork for free,btohqsg
Thats not how that works i think?,btohqsg
They have the advantage of blocking the old forks,btohqsg
Im sure the internet archive has forks of every chromium release anyways,btohqsg
is that browser seperate from the chromium entity?,btohqsg
DOJ or wtv gov authority would not allow that i doubt,btohqsg
if the DOJ passes a rule and they enforce it..its the end for chrome,btohqsg
Each build of chromium will have to connect to the internet and ping the home server,btohqsg
And the new owners can just block the connection for the older forks,btohqsg
Y wld they conceivably do that tho,btohqsg
I think it’s chromium too but they’re starting to switch,btohqsg
tbf  they have no authority over chromium,btohqsg
U can run it on any server,btohqsg
It’s open source but it’s far complicated than that,btohqsg
But I don’t think the chromium opensource will get sold off,btohqsg
yea but google dont own chromium,btohqsg
so the doj cant tell it to sell that off,btohqsg
Doing anything funny with it wld step on the toes of many other companies anyways,btohqsg
why tf are we so high 😭😭,btohqsg
Weird way to end of the year but ok,btohqsg

lab-grown meat  nobut the concept of eating bugs will not be entirely accepted with s'poreans,btohqsg

Trying to find a poly diploma field that can maximise emigration opportunities  given that I have given up hope of having a good life here in Singapore,btohqsg
"poly diploma.. is a bit hard unless you enter a course related to a field or industry that has connections with overseas opportunities for further studies or full-term work that allows you  the student to kind of ""station""  wouldn't say immigrate overseas",btohqsg
ask np. they love giving us random assignments that serves no- a few purpose most of the time,btohqsg
i know students like to pursue education in areas such as psychology  linguistics  arts  veterinary  humanities etc overseas because of the lack of opportunities and things to learn in sg institutions or education,btohqsg
so I suppose the best way is still overseas uni?,btohqsg
typically students will pursue up till a (higher) nitec cert  poly diploma or A-level qualification first in sg before going overseas,btohqsg
eh pursuing education overseas doesn't need to mean your family's rich to support you,btohqsg
nowadays a lot of students work at least 2-3+ years while studying full-time/part-time in sg before going overseas lool,btohqsg
i saw 25-45k a sem fr tuition uni fee,btohqsg
$30 for one labubu figurine is dumb,btohqsg
sg uni fee is 7-8k a sem,btohqsg

have you considered how heavily subsidized is sg school fees (from preschool up to uni) can get?,btohqsg
jellycat is cuter labubu looks like demon,btohqsg
wtf is all these brands like jellycat,btohqsg
money and career-wise  I'll probably always be a good 5 to 10 years behind my peers,btohqsg
yes  i know. the cost of living in aus / uk / usa and transport is rly high especially in the city,btohqsg
(though 20+ years seems more likely by the day),btohqsg
age doesn't matter if you've set your mind into somethingyou can be younger or older than your peers in school/work but ultimately  you're doing just what's best for yourself,btohqsg
in usa  u hv to tip minimum 20% frm my frnd who’s studying there,btohqsg
i think i might study in sg then move to aus / sg / uk to work,btohqsg
that's why it's always said grass is greener on the other side,btohqsg
but eh  everything got pros and cons de,btohqsg
ya sia they prioritise life and work balance.,btohqsg
feels like growtopians (growtopia players) purposely inflating prices of limited event items,btohqsg
for emigration and socially  yes. emigration to a number of places has age limits,btohqsg
don't take every experience or stuff you hear about  100% because most of the time they'll show you more of the positive sides of whatever they experience,btohqsg
um whatif you want emigrate FROM sg and immigrate TO another place  it's more or less the same process,btohqsg
I’m planning to study in the UAE or Saudi Arabia and if I can probably work there too,btohqsg
unless you're talking about certain industries which have ages which they recommend to emigrate & immigrate into specific careers,btohqsg
AUS has a hard limit of 45,btohqsg
iirc the JP school admissions system heavily favours people in their 20s,btohqsg
not bad of a choice but you'll definitely need your connections,btohqsg
obviously  because like what i mentioned certain industries will have a soft or hard cap on restricting certain criteria such as age  gender  background and sometimes even race/ethnicity/religion for some weird reason,btohqsg
this includes both schooling and career wise,btohqsg
plus  policies will NEVER stay definitely the samewhat happens in the 2020s doesn't definitely stay the same for maybe another few decades (ten years) down the road,btohqsg
and JP is apparently tightening up (possibly specifically for China nationals)?,btohqsg
even taxes and service charges are getting so outrageously high to cope with inflation but that's usually on the business side  those suffering are the country's people usually of low or middle class households etc,btohqsg
like  do you hold a mainland china passport or ID sum?,btohqsg
SG citizen  but I'm unsure whether this is a blanket thing or if they're targeting China nationals,btohqsg
there's a difference between chinese (race) and chinese (nationality)..,btohqsg
the only one I know for sure is China nationals find it more difficult,btohqsg
but I wouldn't be surprised if they're also restricting across the board,btohqsg
if you aren't a china national  then such policy doesn't pertain to you,btohqsg
i'd be surprised if you were taken back by such national policies restricting against certain races or nationalities,btohqsg
I'm unsure whether the JP gov is targeting specific nationalities or tightening up their policies for all foreigners,btohqsg
meaning to say  it's very commonly unknown or unheard that such things happen,btohqsg
😅 fella  you're missing the point,btohqsg
such policies doesn't matter or mean anything definitely,btohqsg
until the country's government make an official announcement,btohqsg
or by then  you want to move to aus / jp / overseas to study + work,btohqsg
even then  im pretty sure there will be alternatives,btohqsg
like other ways to get around such cases,btohqsg
in sg  it's usually unheard of to receive a 3rd hdb loan to buy a house but it's happened before,btohqsg
you just need more time  patience and help to support you to your end destination,btohqsg
i have been chatting on tele for over 2 hrs,btohqsg
i was just passing some time to ease my possible indigestion (or is it water poisoning??) from lunch  so no worries,btohqsg
water poisoning or drinking loads of cold/lukewarm(room temperature) ain't a joke  guys,btohqsg
hi this is super unrelated but does anyone know how to shove this into yuji 😭 ive been trying for the past hour and it wont go in,btohqsg
is there a hole at the back or at the bottom of the figurine?,btohqsg
if not  you probably received the wrong display stand,btohqsg
its at the back but it literally cant fit for the life of it,btohqsg
no matter how hard i push it doesnt go in,btohqsg
failing that  I suppose I should find a field that can maximise my earning potential right out the gate,btohqsg
it's said to never find a job or career just for the $$$ or profit earning'cause most often chances are likely higher to be more easily prone to being drained out  mentally burdened or stressed outbut this is just up to every individual to decide because peoplecanandWILLchooseto spend decades to earning money through high-paying jobs without taking care of themselvesat the end of day  you gotta decide how you wanna spend your future years like? toiling away more years wasted when you could've pursued something you were more interested in terms of career or education-wise? or paying decisions which doesn't seem very bright in the short term run but once you grow older  the people around you as well as yourself will be somewhat be glad with relief because of how insightful you were years ago?it'syourlife yourown call to make,btohqsg
part of the reason is that I'm searching for a day job to support a side hustle of indie game dev,btohqsg
you'll need to consider other options to sustain your side hustle because ultimately your full-time job will be the one sustaining your life and hobbies/interests as an indie game dev,btohqsg
maybe try recruiting angel investors or various forms of capital investments for your projects?form a team instead of working alone as a indie game dev?,btohqsg
what's up with these messages anyway?,btohqsg
report to chat admins if you share a mutual chat with themotherwise just immediately block,btohqsg
those are crazy messages targeting active public group chat or channel members,btohqsg
Most of my relatives decided to move there so Wouldn’t be hard and since I’ve learned Arabic since I was 2 yrs old I think I can get by pretty easily,btohqsg
ohh  makes sense now that it's not too much of a wonderment given your elaborated reasoning,btohqsg
is taking double degree worth it. i would like to take nursing / social work in nus and psychology in aus,btohqsg
But the only problem is that there’s some political stuff that’s happening there about getting PR and visa’s there,btohqsg
Saudi is just giving free PR’s 😂,btohqsg
"taking double degree in two places? tough choice to persist through even if one is full-time and the other is only part-timeanother consideration is how you're able to study both degrees or courses at the same time unless you meant one after another hence  ""double""",btohqsg
im thinking more of major and minor degree with the double degree terminology,btohqsg
ah  yes-- hence why i mentioned you'll need a little more connections in terms of background and financial power,btohqsg
family can't help must here  at most they'll refer you but also a bit hard to immigrate or stay further,btohqsg
The problem is that I’ve been to questionable countries as apart of my life goals and I don’t think they’ll approve it,btohqsg
Even tho those countries are close to the UAE,btohqsg
mm  likelihoods are low but it isn't entirely hopeless,btohqsg
you never know when you might meet a suitable opportunity one day,btohqsg
