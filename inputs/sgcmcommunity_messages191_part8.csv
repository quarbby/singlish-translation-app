Singapore ‘open to’ idea of one-off rise in vehicle population  with higher usage-based charges: CheeBut the trade-offs “are not straightforward  and need to be studied carefully before a decision is made”  he added during the debate in Parliament on his ministry’s budget.https://bt.sg/SpQC,btohqsg
One off just before GE? 😂,btohqsg
“However  it is not feasible to (rely only) on usage-based charges to prevent traffic congestion  as these would have to be set at very high rates  which might not be acceptable to many car owners ” he said.So I guess when this usage based charges is up  we will still have ERP and other charges to complement the usages based charges (distanced based erp?) 😱,btohqsg
Usage charges will affect logistics and P2P pricing for End users,btohqsg
Cant they just exempt or discount this grp of users,btohqsg
This grp should be subjected to the harshest standard and charged the harshest,btohqsg
