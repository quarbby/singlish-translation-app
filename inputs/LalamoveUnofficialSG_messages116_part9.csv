Plan your route  car/moto drivers tend to stack orders to earn more,btohqsg
What's the highest can earn in a day normally?,btohqsg
Well I'm a walker so.. for car/moto I not so sure,btohqsg
I didn't know got walker like more tough,btohqsg
I more on the relek side,btohqsg
can i check  for the big lalamove bag  what do you guys use as dividers?,btohqsg
They provide a velcro divider.. correct me if I'm wrong..,btohqsg
Oh is it  when i collected i dont seem to have any  only the white plastic board that i assume its for the base of the bag,btohqsg
The white board should be for the bottom of the bag..,btohqsg
Get some plastic board to use it as a divider I guess? ü§∑,btohqsg
You can DIY your dividers. Can head down to Art friend to buy plastic board and ownself cut to fit your MFC/bags. üëç,btohqsg
Hi Dyf  can show me a photo of the lala bag on your bike? I have issues with it  dk how to properly tie it down on my bike.,btohqsg
hey  are you using the big or small lala bag,btohqsg
i just got the big one but i havent been able to try it on my bike yet,btohqsg
Hmm.. base on my experience with my ebike last time you can try bungee on your bike..,btohqsg
I using small bag. I have a box too,btohqsg
I cannot be like carrying the big one around like idiot HAHAHA,btohqsg
ah yes i also got a box  so i think the big lalamove might abit too space-constraint for me,btohqsg
I tie the cord to my bike box but the lalakit becomes slunted and sometimes it came off from the cord. Haha,btohqsg
Hmm.. try getting a rack to put on,btohqsg
Poke some holes on the bottom of the bag and cable tie it,btohqsg
the small bag doesnt have the straw frame is it,btohqsg
This helps alot! Will do tht later on,btohqsg
What straw you talking about? O.o?,btohqsg
It has  but if i hook the cord onto the frame  i cant close the kit propery,btohqsg
Honestly hooking with the cord is risky,btohqsg
Cable ties and heavy duty velcro from spotlight would be a good fix..,btohqsg
Well velcro eventually wears down if the person need to carry passenger take out and put back on the bike,btohqsg
Cable tie with a rack for motorcycle is the perfect combination in my opinion,btohqsg
There are heavy duty ones where you can use. But once you set it in.. Seperating the velcro may end up damaging the bag.. üòÇ,btohqsg
But then again. Just some of my suggestions. It's not 100% foolproof. ü•≤,btohqsg
Hello all. join as I do lalamove part time on weekends  thinking of going full time actually.,btohqsg
am contemplating if i should get the lalabag for the district filters.,btohqsg
if you are going full time  can strongly consider since its your ricebowl. Easier to filter and plan out,btohqsg
ohh  so it does help? i see that you need to go down to collect it  need time to process? if i buy now can i get it by this week?,btohqsg
apparently you get 30% higher chance to win orders too.when you click on the bag that you want  the next page will show the date available for appointment to pick up,btohqsg
its either 9am - 1pm or 2pm - 6pm. then the whole process very fast  head down  about 5-10mins can completed. I collected mine last week,btohqsg
alright got it thanks  i gotta explain to my dad why yet another bag appeared at home later hahaha...,btohqsg
i have a littlebike bag  a foodpanda bag and now gonna have lalabag,btohqsg
alright  the big lalabag is quite big so just a heads up. if your bike already has a box  you may have some trouble tying it down to your bike,btohqsg
yeah  the foodpanda bag for motor is huuuge. i think i buying the small lalabag as any bag also give you the benefits,btohqsg
anything else i will put into the box,btohqsg
yeah that works as well  good luck!,btohqsg
Well if you have the small LLM bag and a giant panda bag you should be fine ü§∑,btohqsg
do you have to actually use the lalabag for the district filters though?,btohqsg
I Don filter I be honest.. and I always go pretty far üòÇ,btohqsg
And I Don own any motor vehicles tbh,btohqsg
wow  so you register as walker or something?,btohqsg
At first I use my pab  but didn't do any orders after that until my ebike permanently down then I started doing LLM,btohqsg
ah  so walker do get jobs  i only seeing in the fb comments that they not getting jobs. taking that much public transport means you probably gotten concession ?,btohqsg
