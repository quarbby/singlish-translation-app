Wont la.... MT fell so much liao rest of medical counters still hold strong,btohqsg
Other counters cannot always be affected by MT up n down.,btohqsg
When is result eta coming out?,btohqsg
Medtecs is a good example of how much belief u have in the companyIs always easy to be a long term investor when price are risingDoubts and curses surfaced when coming downRinse and repeatThe faith gets weakened over timeSo face itYou are a midterm trader who cannot accept prices do fluctuate and have the weird hallucination your whining and scolding will have some impact on share priceThe world rotates with or without u. Prices move regardless of how u feelThe sooner u realise the market don’t give a hoot about u and u aren’t as important as u assumed yourself to beThings may get betterOr at least known acceptance and better sleep at night,btohqsg
stock market is a strange/fun thing  especially in the case of MT.. unaudited result say their EPS for 3 qtr is 15.4 US cents (abt 20 cents SGD)... Top Glove first 3 qtr EPS is 30 cents MYR (about 10 cents SGD).. but we hear people say MT is overpriced/have business risk coz vaccine is out  but the same argument  no one apply that to Top Glove  or UG Healthcare...,btohqsg
Hahaha was ino bro i out at 26.7,btohqsg
Maybe i should have held HAHAHA,btohqsg

The only thing which I cannot accept is a company cooked the book (NOT SAYING MEDTEC DID THAT)  I can DYOD by reading the number  but I won't know that the numbers are fake..,btohqsg
Heard Jt result 3 nov.  not sure if that’s true,btohqsg
Our job is not to ask why the price move in the way it does. Our job is to manage our own risk,btohqsg
