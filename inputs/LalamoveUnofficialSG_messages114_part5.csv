Can‚Äôt agree more . Thanks for sharing! This is the correct attitude we shd all have ‚Ä¶.if we wanna stay sane in this game and at present situation :),btohqsg
I'm not saying those who do based on quantity is wrong or cheapo hor. To each their own. Different pple have different work strategy. If really need the income  of cos as long as got job will do. Evry1 has own threshold level,btohqsg
Lol llm really doing so much marketing,btohqsg
Yup I also agree . We don‚Äôt come here to judge others or teach them how to do or carry out their job . It‚Äôs their life and their job . Anyway hope all in this platform will share and learn each other and give support whenever possible . No point to whine and complain about things when we can‚Äôt control . Just my 2 cents . üòâ,btohqsg
