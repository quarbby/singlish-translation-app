I have one student totally just sleep in sch and in class and didn't really studystill can score E for H2 Phy,btohqsg
S or U is quite unthinkable after I saw this student,btohqsg
Precisely  im not being an ass hole but how seriouslyðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Speaking of which the H1 phy mye in j1  E was 98th percentile,btohqsg
heâ€™s saying hypothetically if 3.5 were considered good,btohqsg
H1 dun hv practical to save ppl i guess,btohqsg
But on the flip side  my h2 chem  practical is the paper that pull me down but my theory papers (p1 and 2) high enough to pull me back up to A,btohqsg
My cher literally told me â€˜just focus on ur theoryâ€™,btohqsg
I will return to school to sit in,btohqsg
My class would be making noise,btohqsg
My friend got 3.7 but rejected fr nus linguistics,btohqsg
A course that A level C still can get in,btohqsg
Wait poly hv form classes ah,btohqsg
phy prac easier to traineasy to hit 40/55,btohqsg
I forgot what i did for my phy prac in Os,btohqsg
But comparing phy and chem prac  which one would u rate easier,btohqsg
I think i got 28 / 55 for my practical for h2 chem in prelim but my theory was 93% so overall was 78% but honestly was still q disappointed in myself,btohqsg
I hate it when prof screws up sth during the exam,btohqsg
I recently had this test but luckily it is 10% onlyâ€¦firstly instead of just declaring open book  he made it close book and put the file we can refer to as a pdf attachmentâ€¦then ofc things screw upâ€¦The attachment hyperlink did not work for some of usâ€¦and after every single qns  then attachment closes so we need to click ok the attachment like 20x,btohqsg
Then i think ppl feedback about opening the attachment 20x is wasting our time and could they extend the final examâ€¦prof said he will look into it but whether it happens  remains to be see,btohqsg
I think it is both content halved and qns also generally more straightforward,btohqsg
H1 phy only have 11 topics,btohqsg
I better hope they do sth coz we need to pass this  else we gotta pay to retake the paper coz it is forensic (ie law and ethics) exam,btohqsg
And i believe passing is 60%,btohqsg
Prof is the bunny not me,btohqsg
eh the difference is actually quite crazy,btohqsg
Senpai how did you do for h1 geog,btohqsg
my chem stopped at O lvl so I'll never know how it is ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
i mean yk my overall was not great lol,btohqsg
LOL y4 promos teacher barged in and told us there was a mistake in qn paper 10mins before exam ended,btohqsg
then my friend was ranting about it to me,btohqsg
it was the last paper overall though,btohqsg
Maybe your kids can teach you soon,btohqsg
F is F Maths then yes,btohqsg
does anyone from ntu comp sci know if it is super competitive to enter?,btohqsg
Wah wahâ€¦how big is the error,btohqsg
I cant imagine changing anything in the last 10min,btohqsg
Yea i actually told my bro that h1 phy is easier than o lvls,btohqsg
Me during a level chem paper 3,btohqsg
But my parents forced him take 4h2 and he chose bio in the end,btohqsg
Apparently 2023 o level got 1 school had the wrong concentration for titration or smt,btohqsg
That is CRAZYâ€¦theory maybe u can do sth  but how to do sth for prac,btohqsg
Wah omg then im curious if anyone managed to solve it in 10min,btohqsg
Hearsay smu comp sci is the less competitive comp sci locally,btohqsg
But downside is igp may be lower but smu need intv for all courses,btohqsg
I remembered i hate these proving qns,btohqsg
I tot only the 3 main one has,btohqsg
Kuro I just realized we might enter med sch the same time,btohqsg
rip i met the gpa for it but i forgot submit aba,btohqsg
Why you speaking to me in IT ew,btohqsg
