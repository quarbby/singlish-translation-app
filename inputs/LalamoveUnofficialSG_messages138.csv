Usually Orchard Turn drop off is 90% ION. 😅,btohqsg
If ion dropoff  there's a cheaper alternative parking available nearby,btohqsg
Thank you for the info  🙏🙏,btohqsg
But need to haul the items over to ION. That’s why I try at best to not accept jobs to & from ION.,btohqsg
Yah better don't do jobs to n fro ION,btohqsg
That’s y I cash out but not sure when getting,btohqsg

Jw Marriott n goodwoodpark saw a few,btohqsg
A lot big order man. No small order to do,btohqsg
Coz you got hack mahh. That’s why you say this. 🤣,btohqsg
Even if don't say also nowdays so many drivers😂,btohqsg
Go Jurong Island? No thanks! 🤣,btohqsg
Unless after that go JB pump petrol. Then MAYBE worth it. 🤣,btohqsg

Now already starting to surge n ++,btohqsg
but the surge not enough to motivate me yet 😂😂 too greedy,btohqsg
Behind taka ah? Or main orchard,btohqsg
The 1 behind taka sure jam 1,btohqsg
N once jam is super cui 1,btohqsg
orchard i at most take the somerset 313 or 111 order. the rest really need to avoid,btohqsg
Just want go buy something but see jam until like mad,btohqsg
Those take order there one sure shag,btohqsg
If driver take advance job for tdy,btohqsg
That's y I nvr ever take advance job,btohqsg
Cos ull nvr be able to predict what happens,btohqsg
summore need queue up enter cp cuz raining,btohqsg
nno wonder i saw orchard so many order ++++,btohqsg
Want to take also need to think twice. Pick up sure more than 30mins even if you near by,btohqsg
But take advance job then take jobs at 30-45 mins apart,btohqsg
One of the many reasons I avoid Orchard areas.,btohqsg
Take advance job during festive season sibei bo hua one,btohqsg
They see advance jobs got + they take,btohqsg
I take both. Advance and now jobs. 2kms apart. 🤣,btohqsg
take liao miss out the other orders. lagi more du lan,btohqsg
But the plus can actually be 2 to 3 times more during actual day,btohqsg
this year i really dk liao  tmr then will know,btohqsg
last year the oddle scheduled orders at $42 not bad. but on the day itself really ++++ more than $50,btohqsg
But also got people play the system. Book schedule order but remark say pick up now,btohqsg
but good thing is the $42 one can plan. they let you take up to 4 if you conifdent lol,btohqsg
last year i just take and close the app LOL,btohqsg
dont want see. see liao later salty,btohqsg
As long as within time frame.,btohqsg
better than do lala. still need see their face color,btohqsg
later buay song kena complain jialat,btohqsg
N the small rd to enter taka,btohqsg
that one u stuck there sure ice cream,btohqsg
This is cause of the 1 above,btohqsg
This is y I say don't do orchard 😂,btohqsg
The road from tanglin to orchard will also be very jam later. To Those who don't know,btohqsg
"i dont think that's how it works  it's when they book a LLM order  they book it on schedule. So about 30m before the scheduled timing  LLM will change this ""schedule"" order into a ""pick up now"" order",btohqsg
pls correct me if i'm wrong,btohqsg
last time was 10mins for pick up now order. now they change to this 30mins thing really make life for us v difficult. really need to call customer to confirm if non-platform order,btohqsg
my criteria for calling now also changed:1) it is a cash order2) if both the sender and receiver contact is the same,btohqsg
new criterias for cancellation (10m softban):1) it is a cash order2) if both the sender and receiver contact is the same3) call both sender and receiver no pickup,btohqsg
i usually will call if non-platform + no description written,btohqsg
cuz i dont want go there later big surprise 😂,btohqsg
if need trolley i will ask them cancel,btohqsg
if you drive car  they expect u to have trolley one lei,btohqsg
and by right car and courier not door to door,btohqsg
sorry paiseh it is door to door but no moving service. so if the item too big can reject also if exceed size limit,btohqsg
but to me good practice to call...since it protects you + you know what to expect. if nv call  later kena big order you can't deliver also waste your time and can't claim,btohqsg
If u nvr take b4 the job  call better,btohqsg
ya some customer really too much. van order they will arrange car. I kena before office printer the big one lol,btohqsg
which is why its good to have regulars... they pay better and without deducting comm  for my regulars at least,btohqsg
i am willing to drive 15km 20km just to pick up and deliver,btohqsg
You can pick up the order even if it’s not the scheduled time to pick up yet. Example it’s 3pm now. They book 4pm. They will say food ready for collection now or whatever in the remark. New driver don’t know they do like this to avoid high demand surcharge,btohqsg
i tot the +$$ is they ownselp set one?,btohqsg
or am i missing something here? 🙈,btohqsg
High demand surcharge is auto by the system,btohqsg
Example I book pick up now  maybe got high demand $10. If I book schedule order pick up 1 hour later there won’t be a high demand surcharge,btohqsg
But I put in my remark say can pick up now. See which new driver blur blur go and take,btohqsg
in any case  i only filter pick up now orders,btohqsg
and because i only do late night  i target EASI and see it +$$ then i go snatch,btohqsg
Just psa in case new driver don’t know got customers do this kind of things to save money,btohqsg
now then ik... i always thought accept sentosa orders after 6pm cuz entrance fee only $2,btohqsg
as long as is human  simi pattern also have one la... its human nature,btohqsg
last time drive for grab also pax pattern more than badminton,btohqsg
Need to have orders? Or no orders also can haha,btohqsg
erm... actually TBH  nowadays i also lazy to show my LLM app to the counter staff  i just say delivery then they open barrier let me pass 🙈,btohqsg
but dont take my word for it hor... because i only do late night deliveries so maybe the guard at this hour more senang,btohqsg
Tempted to take but orchard 😂,btohqsg
Seems to have quiet down abit,btohqsg
Wah tao gei have Oddle as a fan salute sia,btohqsg

Wanna check  orders with a heart shape means what ah?,btohqsg
The one who put up the order has added you to their “favourite drivers/riders” list. Also means you’ll have a little priority over other drivers if you’re nearby too.,btohqsg
Also you have 8s earlier than other to pickup order,btohqsg

Can park paya lebar square also if need time. There got free parking on weekend and PH. But Singpost usually I just go B1 CP. There always got lot,btohqsg
I wonder how oddles earn a profit during holiday. All the fare so high and I see their receipts sometime it’s free delivery,btohqsg
Actually if U guys realise all base fare for credit order is no longer $9. It's $8.50 cause in once order accepted it will auto deduct $0.50 to lalamove as platform fee.,btohqsg
On top of the 16% service charge fee lalamove deduct from the total delivery fee..,btohqsg
Ya sia. All pooling cheap and far,btohqsg
Do not support this stupid polling order unless it's the right price,btohqsg
Today is a very bad day. Not much order,btohqsg

It's not tdy bad day. It's normal day. Is last few days/wk is festive period so have many jobs with good price. 😂,btohqsg
Haha past 2 days high fare  today normal fare wan to do also shag,btohqsg

Wahhhh? Again no drive today? 🤭,btohqsg
Price too low for him 😂,btohqsg

What’s the price difference if these A-holes booked a van instead?,btohqsg
seems like it is MPV price,btohqsg
but regardless   there's pax lor .,btohqsg
Ahhhh no wonder. It’s about $10 more.It’s just ridiculous that they deem it’s ok that a bicycle with a scooter and 3 pax can fit into a MPV.,btohqsg
Or they’re hoping that a desperate van driver sees the order and takes it up. Which I believe happened.,btohqsg
That’s the same that they book for a bike price but hoping for a car to pick up. That’s how cheapos like this think.,btohqsg
This type of order still got 2 CHAMPIONS snatching?!,btohqsg
At least booked decentlyIf cheapo will book under return documents  half price maybe,btohqsg
This want usually I take and will take another job B4 rtn to senders,btohqsg
$10 very low wor sk to beauty world,btohqsg
How long will you guys wait for recipient to answer call before marking it as unable to deliver?,btohqsg

Waa now prices all yummy buat all and happy new year,btohqsg
If delivery to MBS must take hor,btohqsg
It was meant to be sarcastic 🙈,btohqsg
Guys! Reminder to pump your petrol before 2359hrs  coz tomorrow start 10% GST. 🤭,btohqsg
Rate so good today but still got stupid scammer 🤣,btohqsg
They removed the ‘pooling’ orders for tonight uh?,btohqsg
Lala now got withholding CPF? Means?,btohqsg
ya now they deduct comm  gst  withold cpf,btohqsg
Cpf depends on ur opt in status,btohqsg
Medisave compulsory whether u opt in or out2029 everything compulsory,btohqsg
But if I no opt for cpf,btohqsg
Then the cpf portion they deduct from my fare how I get back😡😂,btohqsg
Sent next day  pooling can be sent within 24hrs,btohqsg
if no opt they still deduct from your earnings to put into medisave  platform operator dont contribute,btohqsg
if opt in then platform operator also contribute but the percentage of earnings that go into your cpf gradually increases from now until 2029,btohqsg
But below the table shows dependent on how much we earn/mth or something like that,btohqsg
So actually they shouldn't deduct a certain sum from every job 1st mah😂😂,btohqsg
Cos there's nthg I can do. If I want do the job then suck thumb😂,btohqsg
Suck thumb  for living don't have choice 🥲,btohqsg
Now I think will deduct for the cpf withholding,btohqsg
That's y now dunno want opt in bor,btohqsg
Get the feeling will lugi if don't opt kn,btohqsg
But once opt in is forever alr,btohqsg
How much of what they deduct will be given to me,btohqsg
I wan to know this too,btohqsg
Let's say 1 mth the jobs I do,btohqsg
Total they deduct $100 from this cpf withholding,btohqsg
Then does that whole $100 go to my cpf,btohqsg
Then that means I'm paying for others n for llm. Which is not right,btohqsg
But if I don't opt in then supposedly go to my medisave? Then will it all go to my medisave?,btohqsg
Then see what happens end of the mth,btohqsg
Any1 has a clearer idea of how this works? Can advise?,btohqsg
Ya correct cannot be LLM use this to earn the extra $100,btohqsg
Haha jialat all platform worker great 2025 start,btohqsg
Fixed salary different. They get salary once a mth 1 lump sum. So can deduct when they get,btohqsg
Agreed.. still not very clear how it work..,btohqsg
Even if u dont opt in2029 all compulsory,btohqsg
Your platform withhold the amount till end of monthIf u opt in  the amount goes to cpf 3 accountsIf u didnt opt in  medisave portion will be deducted and the rest will release back to your wallet (my guess)Medisave is one of the 3 accounts of cpf,btohqsg
If nv opt in die die also must give us back the money either medisave or back to wallet. If not will be daylight robbery lol,btohqsg
I just count  today did 15 jobs kanna deduct $8.80.,btohqsg

My neighbour told me his father has a salary of $2400sgd by standing under tree for 8 hours a day 6 days week. He said his father has a camera on his shirt catching those drive in bus lane anytime,btohqsg
It is very strange for spore govt to practice in such a way. Paying workers daily standing under trees catch those who drives in bus lane. In my country we have cctv every corners,btohqsg
U saw the double yellow lines and u parked?U could stop in the front of zebra crossingNo double yellowStill illegal and fine  but no cctv. Need cisco manual fine,btohqsg
Use plastic bag lup the camera,btohqsg
Next time open car boot and bonnet act car spoile 😅,btohqsg

User to lalamove means what? Previously don't have this,btohqsg
Platform fee so basically customers paid $0.50 to Lalamove and only cash orders will state this,btohqsg
Car jobs all sapu by bicycle!! 😜👍🏿,btohqsg
Wahhhh! I didn’t know driveway of Conrad Centennial need to pay. 🤔 But so far I kena 15 mins also no charge lehh. 🤭,btohqsg
You threw away? So sayang. You sell on Carousell people will still buy. 😅 Legit.,btohqsg
They mark up the pricing but they absorb that amount which means they earn more. Our commissions + $0.50. Hope this helps. 👍🏽,btohqsg
Ya need pay. I kena also $7.40,btohqsg
When i picked up from paulaner,btohqsg
How long did you wait? 🤔,btohqsg
Usually if I reach and they said need to wait  I shift car first.,btohqsg
I think not even 10mins that time,btohqsg
Sure bo? Where go so suay? I wait 15 mins no charge lehh. 🤔,btohqsg
Other way is exit the driveway  wait outside the gate before the exit but quite long walk there. If not have to circle back. That’s why i park outside zigzag loh. Since there usually quite a few “safe”,btohqsg
Ya idk how they charge leh,btohqsg
I see online some complain not even 5mins they kena alr lol,btohqsg
I think maybe weekend or festive they change price,btohqsg
I last time 15 min no chargeThink maybe change to 10 minOr the night parking charge no grace  maybe system error,btohqsg
How is everyones' charity work today? Pay petrol  parking   fines，efforts  earn some money for 3 meals.,btohqsg

Whampoa East Condo has this. Sibei jialat!,btohqsg
Thankfully only a few condos use this retarded intercom system,btohqsg

Anybody wanna do charity work? Can’t even pay parking also,btohqsg
Why so many pooling joke ?,btohqsg
very slack time constraint (24hr)...thats why low rate,btohqsg
Still you gotta park somewhere to walk,btohqsg
And these customer dunoo pooling job 24 hours,btohqsg
yea car maybe problem  if ride bike then no problem 😉,btohqsg
You let a typical Singaporean choose the price  of cos they want the lowest,btohqsg
Is the platform problem  dunno which cb joke come out with this idea,btohqsg
Guys what is this cpf thing,btohqsg
And they implement only can take 1 order each time,btohqsg
The top management really disgusting people,btohqsg
Sengkang to Jurong West net 19 for car  ppl still take 🤣,btohqsg
Worst rates after the CPF implementation kicks off.Saw just now kovan to Orchard 14 net. All Regular price.,btohqsg
Still there’s people that will take,btohqsg
People need to put food on the table. We can laugh it off  but to them it’s still money.. 🤷🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
It's not about laughing. But must less petrol also and rent. Like that it's like negative profit.,btohqsg
Abit lesser still can take it. But this is so so bad,btohqsg
That’s not for us to judge. Only the driver knows whether it’s profitable to take the trip or not.,btohqsg
Maybe driver on the way going west.. so is worth for the driver..,btohqsg
I'm not judging. Just voicing out my opinion,btohqsg
Not wrong bro.. everyone has different point of views.. some is positive some is negative,btohqsg
That's why I said  I'm voicing out my opinion. I didn't mention anywhere in my message not to take these orders.,btohqsg
Earned 40k fined 10k.... Not bad deal,btohqsg
then the idiot that lend his account to this china fella never kena?,btohqsg
We shall see... Maybe next to kena. Fine him 30k,btohqsg
If u never opt in they will still d3duct bcoz of medisave boss,btohqsg
Try to search lalamove website if there is any link,btohqsg
Lala app got problem is it,btohqsg
Why the fair now so little after cut,btohqsg
Example sembawang to bukit batok 10.50. After deduct around 8plus,btohqsg
The prices have definitely gone down in 2025  my guess is due to cpf needed,btohqsg
Maybe Customer pay $20 but we driver only see $15. The difference llm take to cover driver cpf,btohqsg
Nowadays see pooling  if customer ask me fasten,btohqsg
I’ll send the 24 hours screenshot,btohqsg
And tell them I’ll reach at tmr right before 24 hours,btohqsg
Make them wait 23 hours 59 mins,btohqsg
Haha.. no lah bro.. just trying to calm things down only..,btohqsg
U in another group chat with Dan is it?,btohqsg
No lahh. We know each other when you were still driving Noah. 🤭,btohqsg
Alamak bro.. i think u got the wrong person lah.. i never drive noah before.. 🤪,btohqsg
😂😂 how i wish can drive noah..,btohqsg
Avante sold already.. last yr.. now driving estima..,btohqsg
Knn same person take both but lala cheaper so he wanna cancel grab 😂😂 but before he cancel I cancel lala 😂😂,btohqsg
Bro can send here the screenshot U make ABT the pooling order so I can read n understand. Price is getting more ridiculous,btohqsg
It's not just pooling orders. Normal orders also very low price,btohqsg
N added in cpf deduction take even less,btohqsg
Saw this coming when gov started saying want make cpf compulsory for platform workers,btohqsg
But they say end of the day will be earning more because the platform need to contribute to our cpf. But seems like it’s just making it worse,btohqsg
Ya I agree. Too low price. N not enough of that  consumer also take advantage by ordering thru pooling,btohqsg
Llm will find a way to not have to use their own $ 😂,btohqsg
Either take from customer or us,btohqsg
And actually many platform workers need the cash in hand,btohqsg
Yes  cpf does have its uses,btohqsg
But I believe this move is the government feels all these yrs nvr manage to get any $ from platform freelance workers. So pretend say oh this is for our good  say we do survey and organise talks to get feedback and the workers say they want cpf,btohqsg
wanna check something... anyone using gogo also? my gogo app will sporadically go online by itself,btohqsg
Leave it until full (49) then it will not come out or log out,btohqsg
peak period also price damn rabak 😭😭😭,btohqsg
"I do the same thing also. The problem is lalamove doesn't say ""Delivery takes up to 24 hours"" on the user interface. Want us to give them good discount but at the same time fuck them also.Lalamove just here to fuck everyone",btohqsg
Ya  they wanna collect GST 9% from us sua already then still knn round up then become 10% pukimak,btohqsg
Saw one of lala ads on Google got 20% discount with code valid through 31 Jan. Pui,btohqsg
Any one have see this story at Facebook,btohqsg
Too many drivers on the road. Plus some accepted the orders scheduled the next day.,btohqsg
Now no peak period liao. All the same. Just shit prices😂,btohqsg
Hopefully CNY period have good rate 🙏,btohqsg
Now customer got new pattern..last min add in 1 more places and top up  $1+ only. Just wow..,btohqsg
They should put this is Lalamove charity order,btohqsg
Why LLM allow this to happen..... No QAQC...,btohqsg
I'm curious how LLM calculate this $0.50 or $1 pricing,btohqsg
Wah now can use this platform to ask drivers to do jobs eh?,btohqsg
I pass few days go fb n see than know,btohqsg
Can have the fb link? I cannot find,btohqsg
Ya just check for lunch time price since it's raining. Cialat price,btohqsg

All factories office closedThe only jobs is restaurant on demand deliveryPls Don’t expect too much,btohqsg
Sure bo? My office still open lehh? Should I go on a strike?,btohqsg
This one is lalamove self created order if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
Historically cny rate v high one leh.  Office sure many lohei orders. But this year they start the CPF thing maybe chui also 😂😂,btohqsg
Rain whole day rate still so lousy,btohqsg
Earlier not bad. Now not so good,btohqsg
Heavy rain road conditions n traffic bad. Not ez,btohqsg
Suddenly become v good from 6+ but the rain rabak,btohqsg
Wow ur office open during cny uhPHUr office is police post ah 😆 or hospital,btohqsg
Wrong. If I no work  no petrol to fuel your car. 😅,btohqsg
No more rain no more good prices,btohqsg
The price now boring. They need to do something about the price. All cut already we want to eat what,btohqsg
Wahhhh? Driving wor today ?  🤭,btohqsg
If have good price then do lor. No good price then stone at coffeeshop or sleep in car😂,btohqsg
u sound like llm promoter🤣Can do other jobs why waste time at coffeeshop,btohqsg
Oh  I no have other platform😂,btohqsg
All platform now like sheet.Do home base better,btohqsg
All those do partime r affectd by cpf.moonlighting,btohqsg
If less than $500 a month on 1 platformNo cpf and no medisave,btohqsg
Last time used to earn 3-4k mnth..cos of snobbish ppl post on media stupidity level like mt everest,btohqsg
You no drive mehh today? 🤭,btohqsg

That's y I say can hit 1k is very good liao mah,btohqsg
Better than nuttin the rest of the week can rest and ot at work🤣,btohqsg
Guys? If you pick up the order and LLM cancel halfway through the trip. What do I do with the food?,btohqsg
I ever kena b4 I reach the drop off. The recipient say already received the food. The resto do double n double order. I just share with the condo security guard😂,btohqsg
But I nvr kena halfway cancelled b4 lah,btohqsg
Can suka-suka cancel like that even after I uploaded the photo on route.,btohqsg
If receipent cancel means u have free meals,btohqsg
CB this LLM la... When are they gonna show the time period(24h) for pool orders? I tot the customer knows its pool  it's food la  then ask me faster,btohqsg
"No wonder customer all choose pool cause tot ""wait a little longer"" means really a little longer only",btohqsg
I wrote to LLM about and totally receive no reply,btohqsg
Then when cust asking ETA we also reply a little longer more,btohqsg
"Actually LLM should put in the remark for consumer ""send within the same day"".",btohqsg
Saves us alot of time to explain to consumer the protocol,btohqsg
cannot... what if the customer order at 11:59pm lei? now how now how?,btohqsg
