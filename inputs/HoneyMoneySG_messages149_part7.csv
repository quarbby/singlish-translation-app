They have been updating the t&cs every few days. This is the latest one as of 11 Jan.Changes are mainly on the registration portion  where if you registered with your sole account number  all accounts (sole and joint) under your name will be registered  while if you registered with your joint account number  only your joint account will be registered.,btohqsg
I always have the same experience  weekends or weekdays,btohqsg

Hi all to be eligible for this  cannot use grab food is it? Only food panda ?,btohqsg
"Hey guys  wondering if you guys Faced such instance with UOBFor example 12th every month is a statement end date.However it has been a few months where by postings on the 12th is considered the into  previous month statement not on the ""new""This causing an issue for me as Jan is actually the first month quarter lol.Talking to uob assistant is triggering and not helpingThey told me ""depends on system and 12th is cut off date""",btohqsg
Hi guys  I‚Äôm paying quite a lot of rent in SG. What is the best strategy to pay rent with credit card?,btohqsg
Are you saying that say a 12/1 transaction is posted on 12/1  appears in your 12/1 statement but considered as Dec transaction?,btohqsg
Jan makes up of transactions posted 13 Dec to 12 Jan,btohqsg
I see the t&c said this. So strange,btohqsg
see the eligible mcc list  u dun expect them to list down the hundreds of thousands of merchant do u?,btohqsg
This is what I expect I have examples from previous months where by the post days  on the 12th is in the same statementHowever for this Jan cycle they seems to have alr close off my statement so naything posted today considered as Feb. This is throwing my quarter off as irs below 500Do you think able to dispute with uob?,btohqsg
do u actually have transaction posted today on a sunday?,btohqsg
I believe the header of that column say ‚Äòexample‚Äô?,btohqsg
12/1 is a Sunday so the statement got generated on 11/1. (You can confirm your statement date when it is available),btohqsg
I have a simple solution for u which is what I always follow myself.Don‚Äôt do any transactions 3 days before your expected cut off date.And only start new transactions when you see statement has been generated.If cutoff date is 12th normally make sure u hit all your targets by 8th and stop using card until 13th for example.,btohqsg
Matter of fact I actullt doOct12This bring to my attention that my statement changed to 13oct lol,btohqsg
Yeah so if use my method you are still safe.You would have hit target by 8th October. And only start using card again when u log in on 13th and see new statement generated.,btohqsg
It's  in Oct statement (post date 12th Oct) which is what I would expect but doesn't seem to apply to Jan (today),btohqsg
cos 12 Jan is sunday. Unlikely transaction post in a Sunday.,btohqsg
Usually when touch weekends or holidays it‚Äôs always iffy. Don‚Äôt expect statement date or even posting cycles to follow what you have been observing. Have some buffer,btohqsg
So Sundats/weekends/publicholdiay  was the key difference I supposedYou guys think it's worth while to bring this up to uob? Or Q1 cashback is alr gone and dusted,btohqsg
Can try appealing and asking. They are usually quite lenient to give exceptions once a year per customer.,btohqsg
There is a methodology to this üòä,btohqsg
Haha too complicated for me. I just make sure I hit my targets 3-5 working days before my usual statement cutoff.,btohqsg
Thanks! Will hit them up i dont think the live chat will work.Speaking to the live chat is like talking to the wall they can't communicate properly.How to go about appealing?,btohqsg
Yeap Yeap üòäMake sense for SG based or online merchants. Should be safe.  (unless the 3 buffer date are PH/Sunday)Overseas not so sure.The trigger for the transaction to get posted is not in our hands. It is in the merchant hands.,btohqsg
Overseas i use 7 days buffer. Seriously.,btohqsg
Tell live chat cso to submit an appeal to consider the transaction you want as part of the cycle u need.,btohqsg
Good one.Unless the merchant does not want their $$$ which occasionally happens,btohqsg
Of course sometimes u hit those funny merchants like car rental and hotels and airlines and Apple. Their actual payment methods might not be what u expect.Charge then release then recharge. Those I have no solution. Have to appeal Loh if really fell into traps.,btohqsg
should be old news but in case its not shared,btohqsg
And is overseas need to consider their public holidays tooLike in TW  the CNY holidays is about a week or moreIn Indo  there is extended holidays end of Jan.All these may impact on when your transaction gets posted into your account,btohqsg
Has anyone facing payment issue using foodpanda direct dbs yuu card? Mine always fail though dbs app approve trans.No issue if payment using google pay,btohqsg
just curious what kind of transactions posted today (Sunday)?,btohqsg
Yaaa  same. Was trying to redeem code payment keep fail. Then restaurant closed üòê,btohqsg
That's another issue I didn't think about...I only notice the descrpancy on the dates sigh,btohqsg
lol if no transaction posting today then nothing to dispute bah,btohqsg
CardUp if your landlord accepts CardUp payment,btohqsg
Yeah anyways thanks for your help your comments makes alot of sense. And probably the reason why it closes off on the 11th this month cause 12th its a sundayTime to stash the uob card for 2 months then,btohqsg
I think Gerald may be expecting the transaction to be posted tonight (12/1) but since today Sunday the cutoff for the statement became yesterday (11/1)So kind of 1 day of transaction expected but will come in the only in Feb 12/2 statementcmiiw,btohqsg
For gerald's situation  does changing cc statement generation date makes it easier to track? Eg. Statement generate every end of month,btohqsg
