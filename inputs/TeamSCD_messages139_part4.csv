What ur car model n year again forget year sry HAHA,btohqsg
I mean I know a lot of ppl,btohqsg
Half say before half say after,btohqsg
All ask me do coils first ü§™,btohqsg
And Roi say the rims might go im,btohqsg
Cos you change coilsovers already  you still will change rims in the future,btohqsg
Ok lor u tyre kena not my fault ok,btohqsg
No la i not going so low,btohqsg
Atmost 2 finger or 1.5 finger only,btohqsg
you go across bumps or humps will still rub,btohqsg
So if i change rims before coils double change rims,btohqsg
No ah  the logic to change rims before coils is so that you can adjust your coilovers to your rim to not rub,btohqsg
Now alr my sus so soft u can ask@ANBU_ARASAN,btohqsg
But when you change rims again  you still gonna adjust your coilovers again,btohqsg
Hmmm but wont make a diff mah since same 17 inch,btohqsg
So either way  no matter what you do you still will adjust coilovers again,btohqsg
If he never offset it shouldnt be an issue,btohqsg
But either way is the difference is a trip down to fongkim and ask them to adjust height,btohqsg
I just find the logic of you should change rims before change coilovers a bit no link,btohqsg
cos it sounds like after you change coilovers  you cannot change rims anymore?,btohqsg
When it's not supposed to be the case,btohqsg
So yes  no diff  just do what you want,btohqsg
8 35 maybe not so bad,btohqsg
U can either one 1st...best is to do tgt,btohqsg
If you gonna do both at same time  then yes wheels on first then go do coilovers,btohqsg
if you're saving money to do either 1 first,btohqsg
On the same day i got to Cordilla then go to Fong Kim,btohqsg
My own logic is do coils then wheels so can go wider wheels for clout ü§êü§êü§ê,btohqsg
Bring the rims n tires to Fong kim,btohqsg
Lowered car on stock rims > aftermarket rims on stock ride height,btohqsg
Low car stock wheels > stock car aftermarket wheels,btohqsg
This is why COILOVERS FIRST LA,btohqsg
Some stock wheels look extremely good when lowered üòÖ,btohqsg
Especially this new Gen of Mazda‚Äôs HAHA,btohqsg
some car's stock rims not ugly one,btohqsg
Hello have u seen 1.6 stock rims,btohqsg

branded 16s can hit 5 to 6kg,btohqsg
