Kid i got U for prelims gp,btohqsg
I got E and was 20-40%  then D in MYE was 80-100%,btohqsg
My mom lost her mind because she thought thats it i cant make it to local U anymore,btohqsg
My dad told the teacher during ptc I dun care about my gp,btohqsg
And can he do something about it,btohqsg
My dad's advice was read more newspaper,btohqsg
My dad told the teacher ‘can u get her to read newspaper and give more homework’,btohqsg
Welp all in all GP was really a pain in the ass,btohqsg
Meanwhile there was once I did not accept an S and ask my friend help me fight for marks and I got that 2m needed to pass lol,btohqsg
I hope ur As went fine,btohqsg
Actually what happens if u fail GP,btohqsg
I mean im in ntu now so,btohqsg
meanwhile me: oh wow i passed all my A level subjects somehow,btohqsg
My friend announced to the whole class my results lol,btohqsg
Its just tougher for you to enter local uni + if you do enter local uni you need to do like an english brushing up mod or smth,btohqsg
Me too : eh wait i can enter ntu physics with these grades woo,btohqsg
I remembered all I hope for is C,btohqsg
Unfortunately because of my grades its the uni that chooses me instead of me choosing the uni so i guess im lucky to be here,btohqsg
"was it alr on your mind or was it a ""i can enter a science uni course woo""",btohqsg
Luckily my mt was in a separate cert,btohqsg
My friend and i had this running joke where ntu physics is like our last last choice ever,btohqsg
Idk why we didnt talk about ntu engineering,btohqsg
Means ur phy and math must be good,btohqsg
good or not debatable but it's low cutoff,btohqsg
based on rp its like one of the lowest end ones,btohqsg
so you get half the people that want to do physics,btohqsg
but thats because not many people want to do physics due to its difficulty?,btohqsg
the other half is their only choice that is in STEM,btohqsg
Actually why is coding part of physics department,btohqsg
i think also bc a lot of people that like physics will just go for engineering,btohqsg
ok do it and let us know,btohqsg
the people here are the ones who really like physics and the theories behind it,btohqsg
I was only doing my own subjects in Jc lol,btohqsg
yea unlike bio or chem where it doesn't make sense to do smth else bc chem or bio engineering is just completely diff,btohqsg
i have acquaintances who finish reading the next sem's content even before school starts while im here struggling to even pass,btohqsg
engineering is still just applying physics,btohqsg
and they do it just because of pure interest,btohqsg
My fav subjects in Jc is chem and econs,btohqsg
mine is half half. initially no choice became interest,btohqsg
Comparing the 3 sci  I still prefer chem,btohqsg
im still riding the no interest part but slowly realising thats not sustainable,btohqsg
Actually I remembered As were appearing out of nowhere in promos,btohqsg
maybe not interest but try to appreciate it ba,btohqsg
Wait wait when did u switch,btohqsg
U mean u repeated and switch ah,btohqsg
my friend went poly chem engine -> ntu physics bc she said fuck engineering but not that much interest -> working in engineering,btohqsg
and now said friend is going germany for masters in engineering physics,btohqsg
wow i do not want that sia  i dont want to look at physics anymore after i grad,btohqsg
ps1 has taught me i cant code for shit,btohqsg
Isn’t the erhu the basic one,btohqsg
