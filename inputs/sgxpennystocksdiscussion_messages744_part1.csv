🎉Pika World Daily Review – 13 December 2022🎉🎯A bounce towards an important day🎲The equity market recovers some of the losses from the past weeks as vital economic data looms. This week is poised to be a critical  pivotal point in the direction of the market in the immediate term.It was a day of swings  as Pika World tried to reduce exposure on both sides  taking some losses along the way with minor gains as we prepared for a possible massive swing. CPI data will be out today  and it is still crucial as a market reader  although the Fed is likely to increase the rate by 0.5% in the upcoming FOMC meeting🎢CPI: What to expect?💰We are expecting the CPI to jump by 7.3% in November. This will be a more minor increase than October’s 7.7% rise. If the trend of decline persists  as seen from the peak of 9% in early the year  the Fed will have reason to introduce milder rate hikes when it announces its rate decision on Wednesday.📊FOMC Meeting: Where is the terminal rate?💰The risk is on how high the terminal rate will be than what is currently expected. If the hawkish tone remains  it will likely jolt the market once more and set the tone for the rest of the 2022 market movement.📱Oracle: A light beaming🔦Shares of the software giant were up on Monday as investors cheered on the continuous progress of its business shifting to a cloud base. In the words of the CEO Safra Catz  it was indeed an “outstanding quarter”.Growth is projected at 15% to 17%  which is a good sign. A healthy trend can be found in its infrastructure cloud business  which has grown by 53%. There is some tailwind on a currency-adjusted basis  as the figure would be 59%.Likewise  as seen last week  Oracle’s cloud is also one of the winners among the four companies that had won the Pentagon cloud computing projects with Amazon  Miccrosfot and Alphabet.Pika World continued to favour Oracle’s successful shift in business direction with higher growth in its new generation of cloud infrastructure.📮What’s on the menu today?📖At 9.30 pm  we will have the CPI data for Nov on a year-to-year basis. As discussed  we expect a moderation of 7.3% from 7.7%.It is 12 December  Tuesday  at 9 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. It is an event-packed week  and we hope all Pika World friends have a safe trading day!,btohqsg
