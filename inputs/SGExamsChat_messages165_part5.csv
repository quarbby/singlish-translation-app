I think my teacher said smtg like one year got 5 students then drop to 2,btohqsg
This year its 2 then to 1,btohqsg
Most people try out H3 in the start of the year,btohqsg
But to be fair small sample size to begin with,btohqsg
Then as the year goes on they see if they like it or not,btohqsg
If they don't like then they drop,btohqsg
In the end you got double A for math+ merit right,btohqsg
Is there a mark range for the grades in h3 i cant  seem to find them and i forgoy to ask my teacher,btohqsg
I doubt so  considering H3s are bell curved,btohqsg
Does anyone have the n level soft copy answer key btw for 2020,btohqsg
Wait is there mye and prelim for h3,btohqsg
I thought like small sample size no bell cirve,btohqsg
He doesn’t know what he’s talking about 70% of the time,btohqsg
So for prelims and mye they just give you your mark without saying merit or dist or pass right,btohqsg
Well  my school didn’t put a letter grade on it,btohqsg
So did your h3 math help you with anything,btohqsg
Haven’t really done those up yet,btohqsg
I must have been fed lies,btohqsg
Cos most H3s are bell curved,btohqsg
