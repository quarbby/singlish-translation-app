hate to use this phrase but back in my day dont have tiktok so im wont deadass stare the screen for 2 hours straight,btohqsg
not sure if it's just me but i find tiktok algorithm during covid era was so much better,btohqsg
i mean if u have the discipline you wouldnt be using tiktok while trying to study,btohqsg
hard if you already doing it all the way,btohqsg
like say if u sec 1 start watching tiktok everyday by sec 4 u still gonna do it,btohqsg
nah i face a simillar issue b4...my phone literally had no notifications so i wanted to study using online test papers..etc,btohqsg
but before i knew it the 1hr+ i gave myself to complete a paper became 6+hrs,btohqsg
i was that and i stopped so,btohqsg
cause i watched yt for like 4 of those hrs,btohqsg
i mean yea i do watch on slow days but just start a timer and everything stops lor,btohqsg
yea its tough to kick a habit  even more if there is not clear reason to,btohqsg
because the algorithm knows what u like,btohqsg
and it keeps shove it to u,btohqsg
it was either vine musically or tiktok. if u dh any of those last time then i think u quite old alr ah,btohqsg

its just about what you wanted to follow  trends etc,btohqsg
if you were like me..i was literally doing what i wanted,btohqsg
so i did not have social media until i was sec 1,btohqsg
my tiktok acct is actually my old musically acc. i jst deleted everything,btohqsg

but in the end i still gave into the temptation to dowload it back despite the fact  my insta was quite dead before i deleted it,btohqsg
