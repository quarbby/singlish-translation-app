1 day light duty = 0.5 day MC,btohqsg
actually how does shake shack compare,btohqsg
Isn’t that good? I was referring to how scdf restricts ppl from taking private/poly MC if you exceed 30 days of MC in a calendar year,btohqsg
I heard sth like after 30 days of MC in one year they send you for a medical review to see whether you should be restricted from taking private/poly MC. Then they might force you to report to CDA everytime you want MC which sucks,btohqsg
But ya it starts from firefighter course also,btohqsg
Ya then meanwhile with SAF can ck everyday without mc restriction,btohqsg
That’s why some ppl say they know ppl who report to camp only twice in one year lol,btohqsg
Yes can see fr the outside,btohqsg
Wah and why was his conduct fair,btohqsg
he sent inappropriate email to the teacher (idk the specifics cause i heard from someone),btohqsg

That's sounds like a typical teenage guy,btohqsg
If it's not sending inappropriate shit it's doing inappropriate shit,btohqsg
