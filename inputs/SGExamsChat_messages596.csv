"You know that insulting people is bad  huh? so why'd you call me a 'old nigga'? Look who's talkin'! You thought you could use swears to make me feel so shitty! But I feel nothing but the will to teach you a motherfucking lesson on how to teach you to be more polite. A beetle could do better than you in a conversaton with a girl. Seriously  you probably play Genshin Impact  manage a Discord server  never have touched grass  never have even saw the light of day  and weigh an entire ton. Your socializing skills are of the same level of dogshit. You scroll around r/rareinsults  throw those rare insults to me  thinking you're far superior. Think again. While you've been scrolling your days around in Reddit  I've been doing physical exercises. To name a few of them  pushups  50 reps  jumping jacks  100 reps  mountain climber  100 reps  and those are only a few. I eat a meal comprised of nutritional foods. I feast on vegetabled  fruits  and have a great body. We're not so similar now  motherfucker. I'm Ernest Khalimov's bestest friend. You are only a little shit compared to me  and I bet you can't even do one pushup. I earn S$73 162 a day  but unlike you  who spent all your money on Twitch female streamers. Not gonna lie  you probably like little girle. You're a degenerate  plague to society  a stinking piece of shit. and the reason why society is one of the worst things. You're part of Cancel Culture aswell. You live in with your parents who absolutely regret ADOPTING you. You live in their basement  scrolling around Reddit  Twitter  and posting your fake personality. You stereotype countries  pretend to stand up racism  (which you don't) and support LGBTQ+ (which you also don't). You should just be replaced by a man who does the bright and right things. You were born and thrown away  put up for adoption  grew up in ""the hood"" and now spends life rotting away in the middle of nowhere  eh? Respect people's opinion  retard. They atleast have a life unlike you lump of worthless garbage. Shut up. I'm literally sick of it. Get your obese ass out of here. No one wants you  alright?@MIKAAAAAAAAAN",btohqsg
ain't no way u typed it out,btohqsg
ur ass ain't even mature enough to come up with that shit,btohqsg

ok so 1 person cld have a wholesome exp in the sch because of the ppl they interact with and another could have a not so nice time because they interact with not so nice pplalso  toxic is abit of a vague term. let me use a generic non targeted example: some people may see mugging culture as good as it motivates them to work hard  but others may feel stressed due to the  mugging culture and get stuck in a cycle of toxic productivity,btohqsg
