Yeah unfortunately due to space constraints we cannot let everyone go - J,btohqsg
But if this event does well  WE WILL PLAN MORE!!! - J,btohqsg
This is not the answer lol.,btohqsg
Turn PHV COE to be separate  problem somewhat solved ü§£,btohqsg
Cogent argument for a more equitable COE system but it goes against the grain of a free market system which our government is all about,btohqsg
Quota for both would shrink but pricing might be more stable and split in that case,btohqsg
That‚Äôs pushing the problem somewhere else sir,btohqsg
But not much difference because at the end  number of cars (total quota) remains the same,btohqsg
Sounds like a someone else problem.,btohqsg
if free market  why got 3/4 rule?,btohqsg
Well  does the rule ‚Äúown self check own self‚Äù apply?,btohqsg
what they should do is to stop excessive car buying within households.. see the sembawang one  3 to 5 cars..,btohqsg
actually those household with 2nd car onwards  very simple  let them bid for COE  give way to those household without car first.. then 2nd car coe start from 100k LOL. quite easy then alr,btohqsg
For one thing  I feel that the 10 year COE period should be reviewed,btohqsg
But how do you justify this?,btohqsg
This wouldn‚Äôt fly very well with the top 10% ü§£,btohqsg
they have been promoting carlite. plus increase revenue anyways.,btohqsg
What if I split my vehicles as business registered assets over multiple companies,btohqsg
But you cannot deny  cars are necessary.,btohqsg
GST hike doesnt fly with everyone but it is necessary,btohqsg
How do you define household and maintain it?,btohqsg
COE exists for good reason  the aim of the government was never to make cars accessible for the masses,btohqsg
For them they have good public transport available,btohqsg
So I invest in houses  1 family member 1 house  still can live under 1 roof,btohqsg
Who pay lots of taxes!!!! Woohooo country happy.,btohqsg
And now the abundance of car sharing companies that are hiking up COE further,btohqsg
What do you mean normal bid?,btohqsg
No animosity  or hate  or any intention to offend‚Ä¶but really the reason why COE is probably insane now is because people are part of the#FullLoanSquad,btohqsg
i mean  if u got so much money  suree pay more ABSD just to get one car,btohqsg
