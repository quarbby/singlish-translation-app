Hi all. New to credit card game. Which is the best card for miles accumulation? Just started working and trying to grow that. Looking to purchase some apple products soon also,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think I spend a lot actl. Less than 1k a month? With occasional spending like buying of the Apple products this month,btohqsg
less than 1k can consider hsbc revo,btohqsg
if no fixed spending pattern choose those with no min spending requirements per month.,btohqsg
also  u have decided that miles instead of cashback is more suitable for you?,btohqsg
Ok I will look into this. Thank you!,btohqsg
Yeah I want to build up miles instead of cashback. I think might be better for the long term? Plus personal preference üòÖ,btohqsg
but just be aware of those merchants that are eligible for miles! also how long it takes to expire since you will take awhile to accumulate! This card no annual fee also so no harm tbvh,btohqsg
spending is capped at 1k for 4miles/dollar so if your spending big ticket items regularly can consider other miles cards,btohqsg
Use the miles dun accumulate like me. Then covid. Gave up n just go for cash back. They ain't making it easier with dilution n limited openings,btohqsg
