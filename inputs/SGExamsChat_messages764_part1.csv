Thing is you canâ€™t register as a private candidate for o levels as long as youâ€™re in JC/MI  so either have to drop out or approach MI to see if they can register for you (but I donâ€™t think they allow this),btohqsg
You cannot register as a private candidate if you are currently studying in Government/ Government-Aided/ Independent/ Specialised schools. For school candidates who wish to register for additional subjects  please seek your school's consent to register those subjects on your behalf.,btohqsg
The private candidates' registration exercise for the 2024 Singapore-Cambridge GCE N(T)-  N(A)-  O and/orA-Level examination(s) has commenced on Thursday  4 April 2024  9:00am and is extended to Wednesday  24 April 2024  11:00pm. Registration will be via theCandidates' Portal.,btohqsg
Ya so if u rly adamant about transferring to a JC ask MI if they can register you for O level subjects this year,btohqsg
If they say no pls donâ€™t drop out,btohqsg
all too well ten minute version taylors version from the vault sad girl autumn version recorded at long pond studios,btohqsg
I just have no faith in my teachers especially econs and gp,btohqsg
I mean on behalf of the school ah,btohqsg
Yea itâ€™s not worth the risk  just stay in MI,btohqsg
Like sec 4 exp can retain to take o levels again,btohqsg
Yea in which case it would be free,btohqsg
Precisely  that's what I'm saying. Register private got extra cost,btohqsg
but isnt that only if you failed everything really badly and cannot even go ite,btohqsg
bro yk there was a time i was in an old train in 2021 or 2022,btohqsg
Nvm you do what you want with that info.,btohqsg
i wanted to go to another location but decided not to,btohqsg
pov i play music at this volume in headphones and can still hear the ppl behind ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
Lmfao  LTA wants to scrap 88 sets of trains in 3 yrsLaughable decision,btohqsg
Oh yea you know they also want to replace 1.5k buses in the next 2 yrs,btohqsg
Many headphones not 100% noise cancelling bro,btohqsg
wait ah lemme calculate ah  53 KHI  6 SIE  6 KNS left  amounts to 65 trains left to be scrapped by end of year (64 considering one train MIA for more than a week now) and some hv calculated 2 trains a month to meet 2026 deadline so,btohqsg
ah yes the K230UBs and OC500LEs,btohqsg
The prob is they can't bring in enough train to replace  want to take off service easy..replacing is way harder,btohqsg
ye still 2 a month approx  but that's by the end of 2026,btohqsg
nahh replacing isn't that hard  the reason is cuz there are sometimes severe issues when they debut for service,btohqsg
yk acjc girls lost 92-6 to nyjc today,btohqsg
"""today's not my day!"" game ahh",btohqsg
But when it comes to football,btohqsg
if this was floorball I would have cried even harder,btohqsg
Watch lta sell some of our trains to other countries for them to continue service,btohqsg
They alr sold some of our taxis to Malaysia And south Korea alr,btohqsg
yk 4 of my ogmates are in squash,btohqsg
you know by now  the newest model of train should already be running on tomato line  aka north south line  but so far has only done night time full line testing (mostly with 813/814) let alone day time,btohqsg
idk what issues they have with the R151 tho,btohqsg
0% chance of happening for this  Singapore standards of trains are 'very proprietary' to Singapore (door to door length  loading gauge  even powering wise too),btohqsg
it's not to say LTA can't send them overseas,btohqsg
they couldn't even score a bucket ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
"bro she would say ""oh cjc got 90!! 90 sex cases!!""",btohqsg
Insufficient funding + coach lost his license or sth,btohqsg
the reason why Indonesia could use old Japanese trains for their svc is probably cuz when they built their rail network  they had those Japanese trains in mind during planning,btohqsg
seeing acjc squash getting swept every comp is damn funny,btohqsg
