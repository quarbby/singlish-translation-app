Delivery platforms mostly just letting riders absorb rising fuel costs.,btohqsg
Only those logistics companies with own fleet feeling the fuel rise.,btohqsg
Oil price will keep rising  even after war. Sanctions on Russia will continue even after war ends. Not going to lift for a long while. Russia has already cut oil production.,btohqsg
My yellow pannier and my rear box got filled by one single order. Even if the weight didnâ€™t hit the limit  the volume is at least twice that allowed for bike orders. Iâ€™ll carry a weight scale next timeâ€¦,btohqsg
If exceed the volume limit  isnt it cancel would be better ?,btohqsg
Waiting for an available agent to reply  war already over ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Unless you called beforehand  wont get compensation if cx cancel. Already made the trip there  spent the petrol  time and parking already. Better just complete the job and avoid that cx in the future.,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s an incentive for hirers to not say anything and just give a surprise,btohqsg
The orange flask is my own. But 11 bottles of sake way exceeds the volume allowed for a single bike job too.,btohqsg
I just have a way to cater to carry large loads but itâ€™s sometimes a SURPRISE! Not necessarily in a good sense,btohqsg
People who are cheap  and think they can get away by not hiring a car job,btohqsg
Sorry  i am new here. The purpose of calling customer is to confirm the delivery ?,btohqsg
It's in the SOP  when you accept any job  the app prompts you to call  to confirm the details.,btohqsg
11 sake is way too dangerous.But if really the case that is exceed your capabilities. End up need to cancel also right.,btohqsg
Anyone have van rental company intro? Thinking change from bike to van,btohqsg
Wonder is this the SOP that most ppl follow ?  ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
No  but you cant get the 50% for cancelled jobs if you can't prove you called beforehand to confirm.,btohqsg
Thanks. So should just accept and go. Thatâ€™s the fastest. Time is money anyway.,btohqsg
Nope. I was just able to contain it all in my bikeâ€¦ right at the limit. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Long time ago when I first started llm. Noob. Took the job even when it was bike job I car,btohqsg

Liquor n say fragile then ask for bike. N so much stuff. If break how? Sure blame rider,btohqsg

some clients just don't seem to read.... or just want to squeeze the max out of a single bike trip ALTHOUGH there are dimension/weight limits,btohqsg
15-30 bento boxes. Need trolley if car. Then y ask for bike.,btohqsg
Madness. 15 or 30â€¦ is a 100% difference!!,btohqsg
Get used to it guys... Just laugh it off  and keep your inner peace. So can stroke 4d....,btohqsg
I used to take their orders and then call them and fuck them upside down... Most of them cancel there after..,btohqsg
End of the day.. I have leanrt to laugh it off... But the only thing i still cannot get.. Is... Why people still take the orders.,btohqsg
