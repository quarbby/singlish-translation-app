Hi - Just checking: Does Webull/Tiger offer ACATS position transfer to IBKR?,btohqsg
I have a spending with mcc code 8062 which is classified as hospital via my uob one card. I am aware that 8062 is not considered as spending for quarterly cashback. But is it considered as spending towards the min $500 for the monthly uob one interest?,btohqsg
"WSJ: Jerome Powell Says 'Time Has Come' for Fed Cuts. The Federal Reserve chair issues strongest signal yet that interest-rate cuts are coming. The pace of monetary tightening in the coming months will depend on a balance of risks across the U.S. economy. ""We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions "" Powellsaid.",btohqsg
Regarding moneysmart credit card(Citi Rewards) reward for spending min $500  can I add the card to amaze card and make the $500 spending through the amaze card  will that qualify for the credit card rewards?,btohqsg
Should be as long as you are not spending on excluded mccs.,btohqsg
Can I add the amaze card to my phone and use samsung pay for payment?1. Does this also qualify for the credit card rewards?2. Can I earn the amaze point?3. Can I earn 4miles per dollar?,btohqsg
Can add Amaze card on google/apple pay not samsung pay1. yes  so long mcc not excluded2. Instarem points only for min $10 foreign spend3. yes. get 10x points (4mpd) so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
I'm new to uob stash account. I wanna know if I deposit 120k inside the uob how much interest will I have mthly. Is it still 5% or 3.1% or 0.05%,btohqsg
Can anyone give me an opinion,btohqsg
3.05% for first 100k and 0.05% on next 20k  assuming no other promos.,btohqsg
So they separate 100k give u 3% and 20k on 0.05%,btohqsg
If a person leave 100k there and take out the interest of 3% mthly they are better well off. But must do it mthly which is a tedious thing,btohqsg
That's easiest account already imo. You haven't seen HSBC ega ding dong dance.,btohqsg
If this is tedious already  no other HISA will be suitable for you,btohqsg
@antonio191203bro  how you can know like almost everything üëçüëç,btohqsg
Hahaha I just read their landing page. Also these UOB accounts got asked many times before.,btohqsg
got others in the group keeping up with their promo and latest calculation. those are the real experts.,btohqsg
If I need to buy Apple Watch that cost around $800+  is it best to buy from istudio using kris+  pay via Apple Pay using uob PPV? If I buy from Apple Store  should also be using PPV right but no additional miles from kris+. I also have crmc  uob vs  uob solitaire but not correct categories,btohqsg
Want the best stuff must put in effort. No free lunch.,btohqsg
Just want to highlight kris+ is online  not mobile contactless. UOB ppv is still ok as it has a list of whitelisted online mcc and 5732 is one of them. Crmc needs to pair with amaze then add amaze to apple pay/google pay then can use.,btohqsg
Hey guys  I'm planning to use Amaze + DBS WMC to buy stuff from Challenger retail to earn miles. Understand DBS WMC has a monthly limit of $1.5k  wondering Amaze has any limit? Thanks!,btohqsg
Ya don't use dbs wwmc with amaze.,btohqsg
Can use HSBC with amaze ?,btohqsg
"oh  can Kris+ be paired with DBS WMC to make the transaction ""online""?",btohqsg
Ok thank you! I have amaze but prefer to reserve crmc + amaze for foreign currency purchase for upcoming trips,btohqsg
HSBC t1 ya but no reason to do that ü§£,btohqsg
Thanks  Kris+ also offers 2 miles for $2 spend for Challenger,btohqsg
Is the 3.05 % interest credited monthly?,btohqsg
I don't have that acct but should be monthly bah,btohqsg
Hi guys  i already have uob ladies card  uob kris flyer and amaze card. Also dbs altitude visa card. I am planning to use this combo for next overseas trip. Is it really worth it to go for citi rewards? Or i can get achieve the almost same miles from my current combo? Thanks!!!,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I use cardup to pay for AIA investment plans?,btohqsg
Amaze+citi rewards mastercard give 4mpd for all mcc except travel related and the common exclusions. Better than uob lady and uob kf in terms of mcc scope and better than uob kf and altitude in terms of mpd,btohqsg
Hi..want to ask regarding UOB one card cc scenario.Let say:June I spend $1000July I spend $1000August I got refund from June's transaction $700.Do I need to spend $1700 in August to qualify quarterly bonus $100? Or my bonus will be gone because my June transaction not hit $1000 because of refund transaction?,btohqsg
$1700. If not you'll get $0 cashback.,btohqsg
I thought it‚Äôs every month Nid to spend $1000 for that quarter? The difference can be rolled over?,btohqsg
My Company can only credit Salary to DBS  is HSBC EGA worth it?#5C002https://youtu.be/lLU1A9odM38,btohqsg
Can still get the lower tier of $50 if spend $1200 in Aug also,btohqsg
this is refund  not roll over,btohqsg
MeansJun $300Jul $1000Aug (1) I can spend $1700 to still get the $100 rebate  or (2) I can spend $700 to get the $50 rebate or (3) i cannot get any rebate at all even for $500 tier as I did not hit minimum $500 for one of the months?My impression is (3). If it‚Äôs (1) or (2)  it‚Äôs good!,btohqsg
Either hit the 500 min spend consistently or don‚Äôt use the card at all imo when it comes to min spend cashback cards.,btohqsg
His refund will go to August spend. So June 1000  July 1000 and August starts with -$700,btohqsg
Does anyone know when simplygo transactions appear in the credit card statement  I read it‚Äôs either 5 days or 15$ whichever is earlier  but I haven‚Äôt seen it in my pending as well,btohqsg
mastercard or visa? for mastercard only appear as pending (if the card actually show pending) 5 days or $15 whichever earlier,btohqsg
Mastercard  but it won‚Äôt appear as pending first in the transactions? My last ride was 19th but it doesn‚Äôt appear as a pending transaction,btohqsg
dun appear as pending (not charged to card) till the 5 days or $15 whichever earlier,btohqsg
$0.10 transaction on the first tap if it appears in pending. And the next $0.10 it's at least 3 to 5 days later.,btohqsg
What is these 2 0.10 for? Will it be refund?,btohqsg
