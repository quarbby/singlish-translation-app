Prob is i bring her along n initially she said ok but after driving for couple of days she keeps nagging at me and ask me to sell it,btohqsg
Another suggestion is rent it under drive lah  users would be very happy to rent it. Then you can buy another car that your wife likes.,btohqsg
What dors she not like? Car too big? Bo badge?,btohqsg
Luckily mine doesnâ€™t complain  no car also canâ€¦ Iâ€™m the one thatâ€™s complaining about it,btohqsg
wa bro if u keep it up this way gna end up like me,btohqsg
Iâ€™m already planning for my next car in 4 years time LOL,btohqsg
Lol if me I won't consider to sell at all cos the moment I take over the car I lost 10 over k liao,btohqsg
My new pay just got announced yesterday  thinking what to buy when my interest payment not too high le,btohqsg
Haha yea  but unfortunately his wife gg think buy car like buy clothes can anytime sell and buy,btohqsg
Reason is car too big  no tech  very troublesome to take things from rear so on and so forth,btohqsg
Ya somemore i alrdy done full ppf n auto tailgate etc,btohqsg
GG so she expecting what? Rolls Royce level?,btohqsg
Cz my previous car was a Avante and she thinks avante is more tech savvy,btohqsg
Tell her no money la  if she know you can afford to do so  she will have that kinda mindsetShow her the amount of money you would lose from selling and buying  and ask if she wanna fork out or not,btohqsg
i think someone c her in a serena,btohqsg
Avante got the digital cluster  so maybe that one?,btohqsg
Avante is really lucky for its price to have a digital cluster honestly,btohqsg
I mean that time I said so too  I didnâ€™t buy jap cuz tech so low level for the price.Audi full digital cockpit  MMI system etc was what made me chose it,btohqsg
She likes honda jazz  perodua etc....or the electric egg car shares forgot what's the name...the one that renters keep buang one,btohqsg
Even till now no regret  will choose digital cockpit over analog gauges,btohqsg
Aiya sometimes ppl forget car is a big purchase. Cannot suka suka change de,btohqsg
Tell her at least let u drive a yr,btohqsg
Sometimes its not the car nor the person,btohqsg
Maybe you and her should lay more egg  then can use excuse that you need big car for babies,btohqsg
Actually this makes no diff  cos if they wanna take ur car u can't do anything. That said  JB isn't the warzone the media makes it out to be lah,btohqsg
I call them elephants ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ sorry if I offend anyone here,btohqsg
I say ask her to give herself some time to get used to it  dun set a time limit  learn to grow used with the car. Actually true la about the size  when you're used to small  suddenly big not used to it so would grumble  just like initially big  then become small also would find it hard to be satisfied,btohqsg
It's like living in bungalow change to 3rm flat...but if I change to more spacious car I happy sia  just that not so nimble liao,btohqsg
This is a relationship communication qn bro  not a car qn I'm afraid. Ask her to ride in the back as a passenger maybe her mood will improve w the spaciousness,btohqsg
Dun ignore her grouses  address it directly  give her some time to get used to it. The mechanics driving behind digital cluster is the same as analog cluster  not that it's high tech or what ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ it just looks high tech only.,btohqsg
I find maps distracting no matter where I place  dunno where's the sweet spot  maybe if there's the apache pilot helmet visor type best ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
I tried sitting in some cars that I'm interested in at expo  then after a few more sit ins  I realised cars are more or less the same  just spacious or not but maybe cos I driver ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ rear passenger I kept banging my head except for honda freed,btohqsg
Oh the hyundai ionic 5 got hud iirc,btohqsg
I getting mine changed soon along with the wheel next week la  FYI this is 3 days ago spending hor  I never spend anymore hor.RS wheel + Metal Lambo shifter,btohqsg
A lot of people complain about this MMI screen it seems  people prefer the integrated type like the Q3 oneâ€¦ but honestly I like leh,btohqsg
I never spend already ðŸ˜« is real,btohqsg
But the price still abit steep ah,btohqsg
His bodykit ex but paint cheapThe shop beside him bodykit cheap but paint exBut he give cheap paint only because I buying his ex bodykit,btohqsg
If still not good price then probably wonâ€™t go install le,btohqsg
No need ah  they donâ€™t want my stock wheel also,btohqsg
Aiya best is still last time A3 like that display can go up down up down like S3X,btohqsg
Just go for the overall cheaper one,btohqsg
End of day both same price LOL and both side by side competitors who know each otherThink they also donâ€™t want lower price so each other also stayed at same price,btohqsg
I dun recall beside them is do bodykit one leh,btohqsg
I remember it as a spray paint shop,btohqsg
