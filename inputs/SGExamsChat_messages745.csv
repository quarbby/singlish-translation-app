Eh talk abt supportive senior sia,btohqsg
ah unlucky i got A div,btohqsg
ur sch near tanjong rhu right,btohqsg
Wah nowadays when i text my sch football chat they go react with the palestine flag like bruh,btohqsg
Is it cos they know you don‚Äôt support Palestine,btohqsg
Or like every message (regardless of who sent) they also do that,btohqsg
Wait so those from other ppl they don‚Äôt?,btohqsg
If yes it‚Äôs likely cos of this,btohqsg
Wait just to be clear I said don‚Äôt so you mean yes right,btohqsg
they don't do it to others but only to me,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs their thinking,btohqsg
I think they think hamas is part of palestine,btohqsg
So they‚Äôre just misinformed I guess  confusing the state with the country,btohqsg
idk what they learn from their imams lah,btohqsg
cuz technically hamas also kinda represents palestine govt,btohqsg
Unfortunately polls show most Palestinians support them,btohqsg
Polls also shows that North Korean leader has strong support from his people too,btohqsg
Cos even if Hamas does fked up  stuff they just need to win over the minds of their citizens,btohqsg
100% support. In the ballot paper there‚Äôs only one choice,btohqsg
I was kind of shocked North Korea actually has elections lol,btohqsg
true lah  if not executed alr,btohqsg
Even if they spoil the ballot in protest they‚Äôre probably gonna be tracked down somehow and executed,btohqsg
he who wins writes the history books,btohqsg
it is the same thing hee hee,btohqsg
i contribute nothing but palestine hate to the convo today,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs why I think as randkmdkd said it‚Äôs important to distinguish between the state and the people there,btohqsg
I mean that's why we should make History a compulsory subject and expand the scope to include historiography,btohqsg
rly random qns but was there ever a 3rd flavour? cuz i swear i rmbr tht there was 3 flavours,btohqsg
maybe you can come aft yoour exam,btohqsg
oh ya but from ntu to tanjong rhu a bit far,btohqsg
I think i ping siyan like 5 times today alr,btohqsg
Did you see the moving things,btohqsg
but can you take H1 maths and fmaths,btohqsg
H2 math is assumed knowledge for fmath,btohqsg
one being entirety of h2 math is assumed knowledge for fm,btohqsg
Even priv alvl have to take h2 math with fmath,btohqsg
"Also iirc h1 subj isnt counted as a ""real"" subj by UK unis",btohqsg
What‚Äôs the point sia. As if the hot weather only happens on Mondays,btohqsg
monday we have to wear the full uniform,btohqsg
I thought end of last year they suddenly allow half u again,btohqsg
Oh so previously Tuesday to Friday half u alr can,btohqsg
tues/thurs is polo tee and wed/fri is any college shirt,btohqsg
mon and fri must wear uni,btohqsg
polo tee the material is ok,btohqsg
why can't we only wear uni on Monday,btohqsg
sch gonna be more broke than it alr is,btohqsg
not every school is named Anglo Chinese School Independent,btohqsg
Still the same now? I think it‚Äôs cos Monday and Friday got the sch song,btohqsg
Hopefully they allow all days soon,btohqsg
shit bruh my GP WA1 is next monday,btohqsg
Meanwhile Acjc canteen at the cutlery return area at the candeck the table is full of bird shit,btohqsg
bro can't we wear half uni during school song on fri,btohqsg
It‚Äôs such an obvious health hazard but nothing was ever done,btohqsg
no the fans don't even work,btohqsg
so when its not windy  the canteen is hot af,btohqsg
like they don't have those giant fans,btohqsg
After the funorama they‚Äôd better fix,btohqsg
Oh for us next week can wear dhs shirts for the whole week (no need to wear full uni anymore)Btw this has always been the case since when i was in y1 and not a new thing. During hotter season they let us wear tees everyday,btohqsg
Oh I thought even the small fans not working,btohqsg
i heard ejc canteen is quite windy,btohqsg
i mean even if it works it kinda doesn't help lol,btohqsg
also i have PE on fridays now,btohqsg
I mean the ceiling height is very small  cannot install big ass fans,btohqsg
i just bought the cygnus shirt tdy,btohqsg
polo is nice just that if i can i just wear sch based shirt,btohqsg
u have tmrun shirt and i don't,btohqsg
Isok to be like yay but,btohqsg
actl a few of my classmates have the tmrun shirt,btohqsg
they got from doing the hnf challenge during tmrun,btohqsg
the fmath girl is fun to be around,btohqsg
ok most of my other classmates are cool,btohqsg
he probably write some university level shit,btohqsg
and then somehow still get the entire thing wrong,btohqsg
oh ya tmjc offers 3H2 fm now,btohqsg
my class the 3h2 fm kids are mixed with the pcm kids,btohqsg
ya bc last time fm was automatic 4H2,btohqsg
my fm class got 5 ppl from 101 and 6 ppl from my class,btohqsg
if ur in DHS i just assume u take 4H2s tbh,btohqsg
Imagine being in a school where there is rules on what kind of school attire you can wear at certain timings,btohqsg
"yall don't have the ""A"" or ""S"" for arts/science ah",btohqsg
acjc apparently restrict what kind of socks can wear,btohqsg
maybe bc it's more IP sch,btohqsg
Dw my school says no ankle length socks but the school socks are ankle length,btohqsg
oh ya RP got dress code,btohqsg
The last time I was in rp  literally saw someone in shorts and slippers,btohqsg
Some sec schools restrict the shoe lace color you can have,btohqsg
well at least i hear they got,btohqsg
evergreen sec all the students have to wear the sch shoelaces,btohqsg
If you are in aircorn 80% of the time like rp  you can imagine why nobody wears a essential walk in the park fit to school,btohqsg
what are the majority JAE classes,btohqsg
There was one school that had a controversial rule but they removed it after a while. They told students they can't wear hairties,btohqsg
the only thing ik is tht crocs have to be in sports mode???,btohqsg
oh yeah next week got attire check,btohqsg
Bruh honestly one of the things I like abt JC is,btohqsg
Being able to wear wtv hair ties iw,btohqsg
bruh my sec sch cared alot haha,btohqsg
do sec schs ban claw clips,btohqsg
mine only allow ponytail pretty sure,btohqsg
our sch is already quite relaxed on footwear,btohqsg
I alw meme abt how my sec sch only allowed the sch jacket one,btohqsg
we can wear any color sports shoes,btohqsg
as long as we wear black socks,btohqsg
Ohya I rmb my sec sch,btohqsg
They said students can't bring either to school,btohqsg
My friend wears this to sch alot no one cares,btohqsg
ite any color can but i see alot ppl wear white shoe,btohqsg
Meanwhile my friend brought a penknife and that was allowed,btohqsg
Yes because they said both are dangerous,btohqsg
There was also another garbage rule in my school  now that I think about it...my school was actually pretty lax,btohqsg
Cause the most absurb rule was you could not use the lockers,btohqsg
Like wtf...the lockers outside our classroom for show ah,btohqsg
i don't get y sec sch so uptight on SOCKS LENGTH. how isit gonna affect our learning?,btohqsg
School spend money build the lockers then don't allow anybody to use...ffs go figure,btohqsg
I heard some schools practice mental games on their students,btohqsg
Like they specifically create rules that target your mental fortitude...rules that sounds very useless etc,btohqsg
Then In my pri they banned the sales of bottled drinks because the school had enough of students using them as soccerballs,btohqsg
Anyone here knows how to cook,btohqsg
My pri sch had a country eraser ban,btohqsg
because we keep playing and selling them like trading cards,btohqsg
I don't cook  but I know how to. Usually I just fo 7-11 to buy wraps,btohqsg
Technically anything can be made at home,btohqsg
Its js if u have the skills for it,btohqsg
Na the real question is what do u wanna eat,btohqsg
Gotta have people to cook for ngl,btohqsg
Anyone want try hua tiao chiew + salt + chicken that's pan fried,btohqsg
That's cantonese food if u add flour,btohqsg
Ngl i think that's simple enough for dinner,btohqsg
no need crazy amt of prep time also,btohqsg
yea i wished we had the wind from ejc,btohqsg
though the candeck can be quite windy at certain times,btohqsg
my school has a rule that you cannot walk across the field,btohqsg
ppl can wear wtv socks they want now  as long as it's not explicit,btohqsg
try having a rule where you cant open doors unless permission was given from a adult üíÄ,btohqsg
rvhs has a rule that you can't leave the school till your cca ends i.e. you can't leave sch during your long ass breaks,btohqsg
actl dhs also technically but the thing is NO ONE follows them,btohqsg
Ik some schools impose this because it can be rather costly to maintain the grass especially in our insanely hot weather. So people are only allowed to use the field when it has to be used like when playing matches,btohqsg
This is by right applicable to all camps  not just tekong,btohqsg
i mean you could..just had to face discipline,btohqsg
Coz y‚Äôall know how to levitate?,btohqsg
I thought coz Air Force = Above All (rules),btohqsg
Hope the French govt wins big,btohqsg
I was with the Advance and Overcome ‚Ä¶ it sounded very much like our paths are filled with trepidations üòÆ‚Äçüí®,btohqsg
You can't. This is the real point. Don't accept the lie of religion  socialism  capitalism. We are a fucked species. Know it. Hope is smash-able  realism is not. Protect yourself with the truth.,btohqsg
Hahahah coz I made that up LOL trying to blind test how NS are you lol,btohqsg
you're further proving that you're not an acs boy cos you're a gangster,btohqsg
sigh...at least give us some leniency when we're late for pe cos we need at least 5 mins to detour,btohqsg
You: previous lesson cher released us late ‚Ä¶ we are tired after a long day of metal assaults ‚Ä¶ need time to detour somemore ü•±PE Dept: should brisk walk to location for PE lesson ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ warm up!!! üò¶,btohqsg
later ns the sergeant be like : HURRY UP MY GRANDMA CAN WALK FASTER THAN YOU,btohqsg
later ns the sergeant be like : HURRY UP MYGRANDMAGRANDMOTHER CAN WALK FASTER THAN YOU,btohqsg
Pronouncing ‚Äúmother‚Äù like ‚Äúmudder‚Äù has a special impact,btohqsg
"yk my pe cher is allowed to walk across the field to the basketball court and she said ""yall better be there before I come"" when SHE HAS THE SHORTEST ROUTE WHILE WE HAVE THE LONGEST ROUTE",btohqsg
then we have to sprint till our legs die,btohqsg
like during lunch time we r not supposed to go out of sch,btohqsg
but no one follows it lol,btohqsg
thn one of my lect say can,btohqsg
I remb my classmate go AMK hub the teacher nvr punish,btohqsg
i regularly go out to ccp at least once a week,btohqsg
yall got a whole ass mall inside,btohqsg
Bruh CE is literally flanked by Expo on one end Bugalows and warehouses,btohqsg
Closest mall is changi city and that still takes like 15-20 mins to get to,btohqsg
I go Tekong play board game,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm still in Tekong,btohqsg
They go and like end sch early,btohqsg
Yes they did it last yr,btohqsg
so the sch early dismissal for students to go support them,btohqsg
By right they basically say is compulsory,btohqsg
then usually will have how many go,btohqsg
I kinda only went last yr cuz my friends went,btohqsg
i'll only go if my friends go,btohqsg
Bro the vibe there in jalan besar stadium fun,btohqsg
Me and the boys ate at chic-a-boo,btohqsg
Zhi en  we should meet up soon,btohqsg
wtf  ccp is like 3 bus stops away,btohqsg
They got buses to bring us there and end sch earlier,btohqsg
east point is within walking distance,btohqsg
It is actually closer from T-block,btohqsg
Ours i remembered they actually organised it  ask ppl assemble at foyer and etc‚Ä¶,btohqsg
But turns out VJ too did that,btohqsg
Then bus lor but walking distance city point is closer and if u walk properly should be mostly sheltered,btohqsg
Yala which is why city point is closest cuz 31 more infrequent than my will to live,btohqsg
I think the chers accounted before the bus left,btohqsg
Usually what I did is check the bus stop,btohqsg
Coz MJ soccer boys were champions almost every year so make sense for the school to take it very seriously and bring everyone there,btohqsg
U in sch but suddenly sick in the afternoonüëÄüëÄ,btohqsg
If too long suck it up and walk or just make up some excuse to the lecturer,btohqsg
happened to many times in sec sch,btohqsg
Just say your stomach got taichi,btohqsg
Ok la but i didnt mind supporting tho soccer w bit hard to watch anything from the bench,btohqsg
But my friends also go so i also go,btohqsg
HAHA the peer pressure to go,btohqsg
or isit cuz they got bfüëÄüëÄüëÄ,btohqsg
This not called creative  it is called skills,btohqsg
As long as your attendance above 70% back in my day it was fine,btohqsg
I dun even know the requirement lol,btohqsg
"pls  ur ""back in my day"" was not even 5 years ago",btohqsg
But i was the opposite  i make myself present even though i was sick,btohqsg
Idk apparently in this chat I am made to feel old sis,btohqsg
but i think they changed it cuz now is 80%,btohqsg
I remember the monthly attendance sheet reminder from the WhatsApp chat,btohqsg
Actually idk if in every jc like that but this is a topic for gossips,btohqsg
If the box was red u gg,btohqsg
Bro legit not me  u go blame the others,btohqsg
i kena 78 b4  cuz my cher tot i not inside msteam,btohqsg
I dunno how this suddenly disappeared when it merged,btohqsg
Not sure but maybe the coach changed,btohqsg
I kena 68% before cuz I didn't record my attendance on blackboard,btohqsg
i think this ur class prob,btohqsg
Like i remembered in 2019 it suddenly lost its title,btohqsg
Got once I forget sign the attendance sheet for lab too,btohqsg
Yeah I did but its like they auto send out month end the omnious msg,btohqsg
last time Its always between mj  vj and sajc,btohqsg
now its like sa and vj,btohqsg
newjeans songs kept me through 2023,btohqsg
Tm basketball and shooting suddenly became a contender while football idk what happened,btohqsg
Im surprised TM shooting  the pistol girls beat SSP,btohqsg
My time the team never made it + only 1 person went to finals,btohqsg
If on Monday i find out that the boy is in my pw group,btohqsg
I'll prob go buy like like 10 packets of pokka green tea,btohqsg
And you guys may never hear from me ever again,btohqsg
oh ya but udk him cuz he class of 2021,btohqsg
U should just inform ur teacher if u got issues w this guy,btohqsg
It is not about whether it is an immature behaviour or not,btohqsg
But if it is gonna affect ur mental health again,btohqsg
Is not my teacher that makes the pw groups,btohqsg
U know the pres of tm soccer??,btohqsg
I heard it is either ur pw or form cher that does pw groupings,btohqsg
no he got president award for boys brigade but he was in tm soccer team,btohqsg
Tell him MJ‚Äôs history and ask him bring it backüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
One of the guys who created pw,btohqsg
But anyway I alr kinda accepted my fate,btohqsg
i think he prob knows the mj history better than me haha,btohqsg
Tell ur cher  ur cher cant do anything about a student coming up to him saying another student affected her mental health,btohqsg
Class of 2021  means he grad lo,btohqsg
Frankly my mutual enemy in class went to ask cher switch groups,btohqsg
he went navy after thatjust ord rnd of last year,btohqsg
And the cher just did the swap,btohqsg
guy i just broke a portion of my decayed tooth,btohqsg
But like fr pls do.. even polyclinics have subsidy for the basic dental services they do,btohqsg
the tooth that broke was a tooth that the dentist said could not be saved,btohqsg
Yeah which the dentist should have extracted.,btohqsg
if i can ill just wait until ns,btohqsg
https://www.instagram.com/p/C5DqDjXR2AQ/?igsh=MXc2bDk1bmJyZmx6Yg==every word of that headline was unexpected,btohqsg
nah bro waiting for ns just to get rid of a tooth is CRAZYY,btohqsg
the tooth is already gone  i dont have nothing there anymore,btohqsg
Yeah like for all you know there could be other issues. The decay could spread or the infection may worsen,btohqsg
If you have to wait more than 1 month just see a dentist right now imo,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why brush regularly and take care of it every single day,btohqsg
I should rly not put off that email to the counselor,btohqsg
I just finished braces it took 5 and a half years,btohqsg
Painful yes but now I can smile beautifully,btohqsg
It has gotten worse before  that tooth cause me toothaches like any decaying tooth would. went to the dentist and they gave me medicine..after a week  the pain was gone,btohqsg
and the pains been gone since  its been 2 yrs,btohqsg
Ok I rly think you shouldn‚Äôt be waiting,btohqsg
playing with fire...you know  thats me,btohqsg
you're super shy super shy but wait a min while I make you mine make you mine,btohqsg
"the i in education stands for ""i wanna kms""",btohqsg
ive always wondered..why these ministers with such a  magnificent rapsheet behind them which could go into the private sector and earn x2 or even x3 more their current earnings still decide to choose politics,btohqsg
Cause it gives a lot of influence,btohqsg
or they actually want help ppl,btohqsg
they must lah else their rep will go downhill,btohqsg
and like in sg politics is quite stable,btohqsg
yeah but now a bit more corruptions,btohqsg
Good thing is they got caught ig,btohqsg
Pap is huge its not unexpected that there's gon be a few cases,btohqsg
They kinda need the years to get more pay so,btohqsg
And usually u can hold another job,btohqsg
as long as it doesn't interfere,btohqsg
Pap filters out a lot tbh,btohqsg
they basically have split roles some are community lvl some national,btohqsg
one of our past presidents was a malaysian i think,btohqsg
It's js for pressing only she won't get a notif,btohqsg
Lol I hardly go to that chat and read the msgs there,btohqsg
By the time s4 comes out im gonna be 40 years old,btohqsg
Okay true scientific railgun is just,btohqsg
By the time the next season comes out i guarantee i wont remember any of the story anymore,btohqsg
Guess we still got 6 years,btohqsg
Its hilarious i watched the side story first before learning about the actual main story,btohqsg
hi can anyone help me call my bf i think he blocked me üòî,btohqsg
feel like there are better choices for that task,btohqsg
@junghon3709Idm helping with waste management here as well,btohqsg
How's it supposed to be a happy day?,btohqsg
Some say it's supposed to be sad,btohqsg
So you celebrate the death of your saviour?,btohqsg
I'm also a Christian.Indeed we Rejoice in his death for it is through it we are made righteous and his holy children.,btohqsg
It is precisely because he obeyed the will of God hence it should indeed be a day of rejoicing even as we remember him and pass this down to our generations.,btohqsg
reflect on the sacrifice he made because he loves us,btohqsg
how come sgexams become theology exams,btohqsg
Haha we try to understand the background behind all public holidays because Singapore is a multi racial and multi religious society.,btohqsg
LOL my class seating plan is out,btohqsg
why am i front row ;-;,btohqsg
welp at least im not near to the ppl idl,btohqsg
You mean other sch is all free seating ?,btohqsg
lol my class seating plan is the 3 ppl per rowThe ppl around me are quite sane and i can get along with them,btohqsg
"Ngl rn my main qn is did the teacher say smth to the class comm like ""never put matcha and the boy close tgt"" or whatin y2 the teacher actl ask the classcomm to put ppl who dl each other next to each other üíÄüíÄü§°",btohqsg
ngl first term our seating plan is just sit with whoever you want so i js sat with my y3y4 classmates,btohqsg
I think ASR has a seating plan but w their pw groups,btohqsg
My class had a long row with 13 tables joined tgtüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
I guess that is to deter talking but it shld not be the case where there are too much beef between,btohqsg
my class has a seating plan,btohqsg
Like if they put friends tgt  the class gonna get noisy,btohqsg
TM don't have that kinda thing I think,btohqsg
the class currently is cause yea ppl sit with friends,btohqsg
but i feel like they also want ppl to talk to new ppl more,btohqsg
Wah meanwhile I just can't be bothered,btohqsg
That kinda make sense but i dun think it will ever happen,btohqsg
Ngl im between 2 sane ppl,btohqsg
Yea during recess ppl js gonna find their jh friends lol,btohqsg
My class had cliques la but i do talk to some others,btohqsg
likw the boy and i we hang out with our jh friends more than our classmates,btohqsg
Your recess same for all classes ah,btohqsg
I just study during my break now,btohqsg
No but when match up then yea,btohqsg
Channeling pain to smth productive xf,btohqsg
Cause my bsf in the same class as some bozos from.y2 (also the boys friends),btohqsg
What happened to ur friends tho,btohqsg
I actually did not expect a worst thing than my class,btohqsg
Fun fact none of my friendgroup takes H2 econs and/arts stream,btohqsg
its either PCMe or goofy ahh combi,btohqsg
Why they wanna mix subject combiüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Btw ip y‚Äôall start school in jan or same as jae peeps in feb?,btohqsg
3 ppl take PCMeMe: BCMHMy friends from next class: BCMG/CSCMy other friends: PXMA/ELL,btohqsg
January got 1 day we come back for admin stuffs but thats it,btohqsg
Because the principal want us come back same day as jh side,btohqsg
So the entire sch is tgt,btohqsg
And thus jh start sch on 8jan instead of 2jan,btohqsg
My class is mostly BCMe + BCMg with some other rojak combis,btohqsg
No my friendgroup. Its crazy to put PXMA and BCMH in the same class,btohqsg
It is just i like the feeling of everyone moving as a class lol,btohqsg
I dont like my class chair lol,btohqsg
Maybe that is why my class timetable was v nice,btohqsg
Coz all 1 same subj combi for most classes,btohqsg
Jiayous 2y of JC is damn fast  dun regret like what i did,btohqsg
I dun recall i have any days ending so late in j2 (in j1 yes coz h1 chinese is ALWAYS v late in the afternoon),btohqsg
Oh wait my h3 math class ended at 4.40,btohqsg
i donttake h1 cl. some ppl take h1 cl end at 620,btohqsg
cause majority dont take h1 cl,btohqsg
Mine i cant rmb either 4.40 or 5.30,btohqsg
But before h1 cl there was always a 2h break,btohqsg
Is it true that ip kids taught jc stuff in y3y4 alr,btohqsg
My gp tuition cher told us ip start teaching gp in y4 or sth lol,btohqsg
Ngl i rather my jh classes than my current class,btohqsg
Even though i didnt rly like my y3y4 class at least we can just ‰∫ïÊ∞¥‰∏çÁäØÊ≤≥Ê∞¥and do our own stuff,btohqsg
but i feel like this class is ü•¥ü•¥,btohqsg
Sorry c for Chinese jiejie here,btohqsg
"literal meaning is ""the well water doesnt offend the river water""aka you film your tiktoks  i take my daily walks  we do our own stuff and respect each others personal space. so even if we arent the best of friends its all good",btohqsg
Just mind Ur own business la,btohqsg
Ya that's what I do also,btohqsg
ngl i am okwith  my y3y4 class,btohqsg
Imo the best way to deal w ppl U can't vibe w is just,btohqsg
Don't aggro unless they rly give U shit,btohqsg
"but majority of ppl  is just ""i may not like ur ways but ill just let you be and be civil""",btohqsg
There's some ppl I also dl their shit,btohqsg
and dont give me headaches with their NOISE POLLUTION,btohqsg
Think of it as a mosquito that keeps trying to suck ur blood but somehow doing a horrible job and u keep almost killing it,btohqsg
I don't care if U damn noise pollution during breaks,btohqsg
During breaks i can just go on my walks to the jh side,btohqsg
But she does it WHEN THE TEACHER IS IN CLASS,btohqsg
I cant just go on walks when the teacher is in class,btohqsg
If I legit pissed off enough,btohqsg
And for obv reasons i cant use earbuds either,btohqsg
Actl i go out of class alot in the morning to take walks,btohqsg
Ngl I rather see noisy Y1s than noisy ppl in my class,btohqsg
Y1s at least have self awareness  and is not THAT noisy,btohqsg
17 yr old U shld legit act like one,btohqsg
if they see someone staring they will lower a bit,btohqsg
I legit cannot stand her since y3,btohqsg
If it's lt or classroom area,btohqsg
If its canteen idc la. You go canteen party i can just go to my quiet spot,btohqsg
Then if you noisy during LESSON while teacher is in classroom,btohqsg
Atp i may just SNAPS one day,btohqsg
But tbh this 1 normal in my class,btohqsg
I just learn to tune kut,btohqsg
But if i get too overstimulated ill tell cher i need go toilet and then fk off somewhere else,btohqsg
Just do what U need to do yeahhh,btohqsg
Idk how to describe but she always say some stuff and she think she is very humorous when she isnt,btohqsg
And also that day she make me pissed,btohqsg
I told you in ur channel gc alr,btohqsg
It was taught in Social studies  it means ‚ÄúNot in my backyard‚Äù essentially conveying how most Singapore does not care about anything that is not in their ‚Äúbackyard‚Äù,btohqsg
On smth I can't control what,btohqsg
I mean it‚Äôs great in social context but bring that mindset to another aspect of life and that could be a reason why your hdb corridor has your neighbour‚Äôs fish tank right outside your house üíÄ,btohqsg
ok yk i prepped 28.6 at home cause i scared ppl clown and dont bring money,btohqsg
then this girl went to touch the money i alr prepped to exchange for her 10 dollar note,btohqsg
Then some more she is shit at counting money (BASIC MATHS) so she legit wasted my time sia,btohqsg
btw for anyone curious this is what the girl did that make me SNAPS,btohqsg
no cause she wanted to exchange the money i alr prepped with her 10 dollar note but the thing is she was counting the money for like 5min alrbecause she cant do maththen i was kinda pissed cause other ppl havent put their money in the bag yet. ngl i rather they not touch the envelope money but then if they really need to  and they do it properly unlike this woman who cant even do basic counting  i wouldnt be so pissed,btohqsg
Moral of the story1. Bring exact amount or close ($2 is fine). Dont bring 10 dollars when the amount specified is 1.102. LEARN TO COUNT INSTEAD OF MAKING NOISE IN CLASS EVERYDAY,btohqsg
