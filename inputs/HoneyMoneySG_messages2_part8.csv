the 5 % off will last for how long,btohqsg
So withdraw more than usd 10k  no fees?,btohqsg
So transfer sgd or usd to ftx ?,btohqsg
Always USD for crypto. The spreads for SGD are ridiculous,btohqsg
Dbs remit USD is free but around 0.6% spread from spot rate doing SGD to USD conversion,btohqsg
To work around that I use IBKR transfer USD into DBS MCA  $10 Sgd fee still worth it due to the better ratea,btohqsg
10 sgd is fixed regardless the amount?,btohqsg
USD inbound transfers to DBS MCA,btohqsg
the 5% off fee is forever? Is there a fixed period for new users?,btohqsg
Sgd10 charged by ibkr or dbs?,btohqsg
I think i just do video on this better  answer all the questions,btohqsg
Hmmm  but futu transfer to dbs no fees correct,btohqsg
Yes but futu has 0.3% fx spread,btohqsg
So up to you compare between the spread vs $10 sgd which damage is higher,btohqsg
Chris  your new BTO videos can highlight this...,btohqsg

Hello  everyone. Nice to meet you.,btohqsg
Have anyone watched the Cafe money ep34 on cash flow on YouTube.There are a few key takeaway from the video.Benny [one of the host] mention that there is this tactics known as 2 percent interest apr balance transfer. Want to know how does it work?he mentioned that open a private limited company to get loans. I understood it need to be operational. But how do make it less effort while able to maximise the loan. And does this work with property as well? He only mention briefly without on how to do it.Hopefully someone can chat more about this and we learn together.,btohqsg
I can talk about the first one. Many ways about it woth financial institutions. But I talk about using IBKR to borrow margin.Ibkr us charges 1.56% interest on margin. So if you withdraw cash on margin against your investment portfolio collateral  you dont have to sell your stocks and they can still grow  while you withdraw at 1.56% rate,btohqsg
For IBKR SG  the rate is 2.56% pa so less attractive. But in the grand scheme of things  a 2.56% interest rate is not too shabby either when using for non housing loans,btohqsg
Anyway i hope everyone is doing well in your portfolios especially this week! Big tech are leading the gains (less FB),btohqsg
Thanks Marc  let me digest this news abit and gather some opinions online while i script it,btohqsg
The method is saying is using the balance of margin account. Didn't think of that. Thank you very much. Anyone else have the idea on credit card balance transfer?,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone using the Revolut app or card? May I know how to use it and for what purpose or how to maximize it? Appreciate it!,btohqsg
Currently I think the instarem have the best deal. Same with zero foreign transaction fee,btohqsg
Good for public transport 20% cashback,btohqsg
revolut card 3 x $10 transaction need to be within how many days ah?,btohqsg
Within the promotion period  usually 20 days,btohqsg
Hey chris  do you have a video on best miles card? Been researching and no conclusion yet,btohqsg

Can Gemini use xfers for deposit?,btohqsg
Not sure  i just remit USD via dbs remit,btohqsg
U mean use fast transfer from dbs to Gemini?,btohqsg
It's a US bank account  FAST only works for local banks,btohqsg
What will you do to your moneyowl dimensional fund after 31 Dec? Their first 10k free mgmt fee will end by then right?,btohqsg
I have a feeling MoneyOwl will extend the promo. Because once they stop this there is no competitive advantage over Endowus anymoee,btohqsg
But if they don't  then i have content to make again,btohqsg
Hi just to check if u invest your srs account do u create a different goal in Endowus or u add the srs fund to your core investment?,btohqsg
I created a different goal  since I am buying different funds as well,btohqsg
"@ChrisHMSGhow do we differentiate between ""advice"" and fear mongering",btohqsg
The media does not earn money from their stock picks. They earn money from attention  from clicks  from ad revenue  from scandals  from contraversy. Therefore  their interest is always to create content and titles that make you click,btohqsg
"@ChrisHMSGI remembered that these are some ""top wall Street analysis"" that said October will crash cos of ""black swan"" event. End up October was one of the best rebounds. I held through and paid off big time",btohqsg
Do your own homework  read the financial statements  read what bears say about the company/stock  do they make sense,btohqsg
Always consume from opposite viewpoints and then make your stand,btohqsg
Yup I did. The stuff and etf and I invest in is fundamentally good basics. Ex: FAANG  big tech  well established ETFs like SPY  VOO  VTI. can't possibly go wrong mah,btohqsg
Yeah i hope u didnt sell off your stockpicks despite Sep being a really bearish month,btohqsg
