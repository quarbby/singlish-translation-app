In a tough and weak sentiments market  it is best to wait out and not rush into any new positions. There will always be a more opportune time and now is definitely not the time unless you have very strong holding power and too much money to burn.Trade with care. Market going to a reset mode it seems. We will hoot and take our revenge when they reset . Good luck!,btohqsg
agree bro. But question is when the reset will stops? my watchlist is SMI cos OIO has been hitting quite a few home run and left this joker/shiny star to shoot up for the next round,btohqsg
Hope more counter BB going to catch shorties .ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
"Honestly  market sentiments too weak. BBs also won't play. If they want to play  they will prop up sentiments by creating the bullish atmosphere.A top trader said this.""Market sentiments = willingness of retailers to risk""",btohqsg
