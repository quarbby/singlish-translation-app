Might have chance. Last round that major oil spill  Mencast was  featured and involved.However  so far no details on how bad is this spill.Hence  all depends on how the BBs see this.28 seems pivot too with a big married deal done here last week too if remember right.OSOD / DYODD. Added back some Mencast 28 for gambling games yesterday . Hope to scalp along . Market not easy still so trade cautious,btohqsg
Sapphire have been ranging several rounds and are now back to an area of value again.(Attached daily and weekly chart for TA reference)$0.053/$0.054 looks like it should hold and pivot considering that it was quite easy to TP $0.060/$0.061 on last few contra spike.(IMO This suggests that BBs are highly likely still in the game but likely flushing out more retailers)Anyways DYODD / OSOD. 🙏🙏🙏,btohqsg
FA wise  seems to suggest that- Sapphire are trading cheaply too with their NAV being approx $0.26x (based on SI)- they are profitable and does not have any ongoing concerns to worry of (based on the recent reported financials)Current range of $0.052-$0.054 does seems like a strong pivot to try some.Nevertheless  please DYODD / OSOD and react accordingly always as overall penny market sentiments not the strongest too. It has been quite selective.Reminder to self/all:1) Every spike best to sell first,btohqsg
In fact  many counters pivoting and at area of value.Let’s just hope and pray BBs come back sooner than later,btohqsg
I feel sapphire don’t need chase . Camp at pivot and wait is best as imo   BBs still try to flush . Dyodd.,btohqsg
