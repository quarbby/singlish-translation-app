Hi team  just a query. A booking made in Agoda App is to be paid in JPY. If I'm gonna use UOB Krisflyer cc  there'll be FCY along with the awarded miles right if I'm not wrong?So to mitigate the FCY by UOB  can I pair the card with Amaze  and make the payment to Agoda and still earn the miles?,btohqsg
No. Uob krisflyer travel is whitelist by name check. Using amaze will not give u the correct 3mpd.,btohqsg
Ok Sure  Thank you very much.,btohqsg
Amaze + uob lady with travel category selected would work through.,btohqsg
