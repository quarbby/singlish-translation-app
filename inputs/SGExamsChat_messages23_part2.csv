Guyss can I ask for tips for H2 math? A j2 here  I've done many practices and stuff but during tests and block tests  I tend to feel less clear headed and often make silly mistakes or can't do qns which I can do outside exam conditions. Esp my school papers  I always feel super shag and while doing  I always have the feeling that the math dept srsly knows how to choose the most tedious or most complicated questions  like I tried the supp exercises and stuff they're okay. But when it comes to the test  its a totally different ball game. And after a test  I sometimes feel demoralised but the results can be quite unexpected... Thanks!,btohqsg

Maths is just knowing your formulas  concepts well and practising over and over again,btohqsg
