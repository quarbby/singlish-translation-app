But it mostly stays the same anyways,btohqsg
Cuz they need time togerrymanderredistrict the GRCs/SMCs,btohqsg
As in they dun announce their committees,btohqsg
There will always be tiny changes,btohqsg
Oh do u mean their mps in each grc / smc,btohqsg
They do because the Opposition MPs ask them in Parliamentary replies like every month,btohqsg
I read it as their grc / smc boundaries,btohqsg
And if u refer to that  they started to announce some already,btohqsg
The committee has yet to be convened atm,btohqsg
As far as i know  they did announce the mps running in my grc,btohqsg
Those are for running candidates and it's tentatively,btohqsg
Because without the committee they won't know the actual districts,btohqsg
Tbh it will largely remain unchange anyways,btohqsg
No.. usually it will change every GE,btohqsg
Especially since last GE idk about Sengkang GRC ah..,btohqsg
that is the power of the ruling party,btohqsg

If it’s this year probably in the last 2 months  since the EBRC hasn’t been convened yet a sept election is looking less and less likely. Probably can rule out a sept election entirely if by the end of June the EBRC hasn’t been convened yet,btohqsg
Or maybe it could be a Jan 2025 election,btohqsg
Possibly May 2025 but I think there’s very little chance it would be any later than that,btohqsg
Are you saying in the Singapore embassy in Japan they give free chicken rice after voting?,btohqsg
I thought that’s what he meant,btohqsg
i think he meant that a chicken rice stall is nearby,btohqsg
Oh I thought chicken rice as in the Singapore chicken rice,btohqsg
ok im not particularly sure but i dun think it is likely that the embassy give free food,btohqsg
I wonder if I write in to request to visit different embassies in Singapore would they accept it,btohqsg
Just to have a look around,btohqsg
I kind of want to visit the Russian embassy in Singapore  the building seems quite interesting from what I see online,btohqsg
They even have a hot spring in the compound,btohqsg
