Anyone knows if u top up ur SA to FRS requirement of $192k now At age 55All the excess abv FRS by that timeeg $250k in SA from interest compounding - $210k revised FRS requirement at age 55= $40k excess  can be withdrawn at one shot?Or got limitation..?‚ÄúPart of your account is reserved‚Äù is the message shown at cpf website..,btohqsg
I think there's some information here:https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/retirement-income/retirement-withdrawals/withdrawing-for-immediate-retirement-needs,btohqsg
If you see the withdraw table:https://www.cpf.gov.sg/content/dam/web/member/retirement/documents/Withdrawalrulestable.pdf,btohqsg
It is saying that you can withdraw upto 50% of your CPF savings after age 55 (but before 65),btohqsg

Which Mastercard is best for Grabpay top up? So far Citibank cashback plus seem good.Any card recommendation for lump sum payment cashback like car insurance  road tax and MCST?Cardup for MCST via Maybank is abit intimidating for me haha.AXS charge $5.5 while cardup charge more than 2%. Too much effort haiz,btohqsg
for top-up  I'm afraid AMEX is your only friend,btohqsg
what? AMEX have fee?I been using POSB Mastercard for grabpay top up to avoid the fee. Feel like I missing a lot.,btohqsg
This part of your account has been reserved are due to those interest and RSTU which you used cash to top up.There is a clause for this amount to be reserved for transferring to RA when u reached 55.Rest if above FRS u can take withdraw upon 55.,btohqsg
