For the moomoo promo  the 6.8% only applies for 30 days but you have to keep funds in there for 60 days. Hm….,btohqsg
The key word is up to 6.8 %. So the reality is that you are probably going to get less than that due to the actual mechanism.,btohqsg

Actually confirm lesser la  bec even if I take the usd fund for higher return  the exchange rate spread in MooMoo will still cost me close to 1%  not to mention exchange rate fluctuations 😅And subscribing and redemption of the fund  there is no return for day1 and last day  effectively losing 2 days.In the past 6.8%  no need to be so calculative  bec it was real 6.8%  can give up a bit  but this current 6.8% is just a top up of 0.84%pa over 60days.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  how long does it take for Krisflyer UOB bonus miles to be credited for you guys? Seen some mixed anecdotes so wanted to check if there's any way to get the 3mpd credited asap. Thanks!,btohqsg
Will it be faster if using Kris+ ?,btohqsg
Interesting. Thought it will come 2 months after the membership year,btohqsg
Kris+ 3mpd is credited beginning of next month.,btohqsg
Does it make sense for hsbc to send email said will ask for details within 3 weeks elsr block your account?? But didn't say what details,btohqsg
Why so serious? Did you do frequent transfers in and out?,btohqsg
Aiyah. Normal la. Want to play HSBC EGA sure will eventually get this.Just answer all their questions honestly and provide all information they want. They just need to complete enhanced due diligence on u to prove you own the funds in the account.,btohqsg
These days thanks to fujian gang. Very easy to trigger bank thresholds,btohqsg
And for HSBC I think one big red flag to them is non first party transfers.Make sure all money in and out is to same name account.,btohqsg
For membership year for Krisflyer UOB  it's based on which month you apply for the card right haha,btohqsg
Ya normal  i just go branch settle one shot  mine was a letter. I got call also asking for funds detail,btohqsg
I dont know what to say to be honest when they ask why so much amt in and out. I say i got 40k avg giro each month leh lol,btohqsg
Do you get to see own RM or it's other staff?,btohqsg
Rm i think since i am priority on the monthlyb15k routr,btohqsg
Hi.. can I check if you have found any method?What card u use to pay for valuation report?,btohqsg

Anyone know how to used HSBC EGA to giro pay CRMC?,btohqsg
Download citi giro form and fill in hsbc ega account as source.,btohqsg
Mail the GIRO form to Citibank,btohqsg
I need to do this every month am I right? Considering that each month spending differs?,btohqsg

Using HSBC EGA Giro to pay credit card dues  how do you handle credit card annual fees waiver? Just allow the annual fees to be GIRO deducted this month  and then let the waiver to be credited back in next month’s card statement?,btohqsg
this looks like a good deal?,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask how does HSBC live + determine the starting and ending date every month to calculate the 600 min spend? Is it using the bank statement date?,btohqsg
Good if you need the high speed,btohqsg
Make sure annual fee is waived before giro due date,btohqsg
Just say for bonus interest earning. Be honest. Because whatever you say they may ask u for documentation. U lie u sabo yourself when u cannot produce and they will ban u.For example you say oh I a lot of in/out due to share investments. They will ask u for investment statements. You cannot give then you will be punished.,btohqsg
Punished still ok. Fwrd to polis investigate for money laundering u jia lat liao,btohqsg
"""because of your bank's bullshit fresh funds policy instead of just a flat high interest rate""",btohqsg
I said this to the South Asia anti fraud person who called me after my HSBC transfers got blocked (the one where they call u back one day later)U know your bank has the requirement for 5 fast transfers out.,btohqsg
Lol giro thru hsbc all have documentation,btohqsg
