Odyssey FC isn't great esp old gen,btohqsg
Caltex if you're ocbc still not so bad. Else if im you I'd go sino,btohqsg
Actually they don't always check pdvl,btohqsg
I've tried bef multiple times only once i got asked for pdvl,btohqsg
Even for motorcycle  I’m also factoring the maintenance costs in. Cos the mileage when moving around between jobs  is technically “doing nothing” but using fuel - and wear & tear is occurring.,btohqsg
Wanna see van go see diesel,btohqsg
I remember long long ago I saw Suzuki every selling like 30k😂😂,btohqsg

And with traffic now getting back to pre covid days  bad traffic eats petrol even faster,btohqsg
EV mafan when u think of 2 HR charging time,btohqsg
unless your blk can charge or u stay landed,btohqsg
U mpv? But even then  don't think there are that many mpv jobs around. Then if u not mpv  car jobs with good price very little unless special days. N if no sticker  on normal weekdays those good priced jobs always have sticker drivers bidding nowdays  almost impossible to get,btohqsg
I tried bidding 2 good priced jobs just now  both have the lalabag/sticker msg appear😅,btohqsg
Lala bag n star cash caltex needs to buy ?,btohqsg
Art test kit need to buy from llm ?,btohqsg

Might as well find a job that can pay you at least 2-3x that,btohqsg

weekday work Mac Donald . Sunday work llm😂,btohqsg
Cos can imagine - those who are employed and gotta be back in office; also may not order IF other coworkers tarbao back.However those who have a slower pace of life and have the spare cash to pay for delivery  may still carry on.If anything  perhaps now onwards a larger portion of orders might be well  larger in volume (and weight),btohqsg
Really?Just go llm office there to collect? Need booking slot ?,btohqsg
You got yours tooDidn’t make any appointment - I happened to be in the area so I rode over. Waited a while  but ok la!100 dollar fuel voucher  although my motorcycle parking was 1.50! 😵,btohqsg
In a way  by having more delivery folks signing up  LLM is also diversifying the number of delivery folks who can take up jobs when others can’t make it - from motivation (or lack thereof)  weather  personal schedules etcCan’t rely on it as a fulltime thingie.When SMM was in full force  people would probably rather send us to pick up and deliver food. Gut feel is that now those who should be at the workplace aren’t ordering like before - and might just makan with friends/colleagues or tarbao together.Personally I rather send items but not food.But for homeowners who need a vehicle to move stuff  that demand will be there - just a matter of how many of them.I’ve enjoyed running a LLM job for a hearing aids company that a friend also works at - because I felt that I was earning while being a force multiplier for their business. Win-win  so they say. 🙂However this is an important time to really do the math  especially for 4 wheeled drivers. Because for motorbikes  the worst fuel consumption comes at about 15-20 kmpl. My own bike can occasionally touch 32 kmpl  and some even 40-50 kmpl.,btohqsg
We all need a backup plan,btohqsg
Customer late for pick up what to do? Any fee ?,btohqsg
