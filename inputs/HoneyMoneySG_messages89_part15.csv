Happy CNY everyone  I have an interactive brokers account  and I also have an Australian bank account domiciled in Australia. I was wondering what is the most cost efficient way of depositing USD into my interactive brokers account from my Australian bank account - 2 ways I can think of. My IB account is a singapore IB account and I am Singaporean. Thanks for the help!1. Transfer from Australian bank to sg bank using wise  then deposit into IB and convert SGD to USD2. Deposit from australian bank account to IB  then convert AUD to USD,btohqsg
My IBKR account is us ib account but I think the mechanics should be the same. They should be using a us based account to custodise the usd cash.The key is to find a sending bank that doesn‚Äôt charge for sending usd into a us bank based in us.You didn‚Äôt specify if your Australia bank account is usd or aud? And which bank is it?Anyway looking at your situation I would say the best way is to remit aud directly from your Australia bank into ib. I‚Äôm sure they accept aud cash. Then do a fx convert for $2 in ib into usd if u wish.,btohqsg
