Hi I recently applied for the sbf in may. Does anyone know how long it takes from getting a queue number to actually going down for an appt at hdb to choose the unit? Within 1 week?,btohqsg
I think more than a weekAnyway  getting a queue number is one thing  getting an appointment for flat selection is anotherAnd unless you get a really good queue number  don't assume that you will definitely get to choose a unit,btohqsg
Hi I still got 4 more year to 55 worth to get a resale or a BTO 3rm or a SBf ? Or just endure to 55 and pay off all mortgage and get a old man suites Still got Existing mortgage to pay so I wonder if I sell off mine HDB now and get smaller HDB I can no nedd to pay the remind mortgage and all return to cpf so next flat I can pay in fullAny advice,btohqsg
here's what a property agent once advised my parent.. pay off your current mortgage in full first. then you can downsize. (eg 4R to 2FR) if your financial is healthy  you can earn some profit from selling your current housing unit. nonetheless  it depends on your finance.,btohqsg
What about if I sell off the existing flat and downgrade now to a 3rm bto so I can save more on the mortgage cost paying still need pay up to 4-5yrs ? If I drag to 5yr more i become 55 don't it will be harder for me to get a 3rm ? Unless I opt for a old man suite,btohqsg
But if I opt to selling off existing hdb opt for bto 3rm I guess I need wait for at least 4yrs min so I left 1yr more for mortgage will this choice better or just wait until pay filly in 5yr time but worry if by then I 55 will be harder to get bto 3rm as cpf life lock down,btohqsg
hmm i suggest you can ask property agent? i get your question but best to ask them as they're more expert ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Just pop by any agent any costs incurred? To seek advice wondering wool they give a impartial advice as they're wanna make sale's hahaha,btohqsg
some property agent one time consultation no fee. subsequently fee will be imposed.. some don't mind sharing knowledge at no cost ðŸ« ,btohqsg
But you can earn profit regardless just pro rata?,btohqsg

Hi anyone know theHFE letter have been more than 30 working days and yet did not have any sms toinformation about the status. When checking online it stated pending. Anyone encounter this issue?,btohqsg
Me too. I guess no hope already ðŸ˜ž,btohqsg
I called them. Pending the offical reply. They say only need the HLE approval when selecting flat.,btohqsg
So got to wait for the letter,btohqsg
Usually hoe they notify u if letter fail or success,btohqsg
HFE letter most likely won't have any issues as long as all applicants have stable income for the past 12 months or so. The concern is the max loan amount that they can offer based on your existing loan commitments  etc.,btohqsg
Usually they will sms or email or call to notify?,btohqsg
Based on my experience  both SMS and email  unless you only opt in for either one,btohqsg
This was how I was notified. Just realised both were sent at 5:01pm. Most likely automated,btohqsg
Oh can opt? I didn't see in when I submit,btohqsg
It's under your profile settings where you can choose how you want to receive your notifications,btohqsg
Oh the setting ah ok sure thx,btohqsg
