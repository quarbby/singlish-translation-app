my bad desmond  busy with stuff didn't continuemy personal take: averaging down is probably the worst strategy one can embark on. a friend was asking why not. i gave an exampleu do averaging down 5 times. when u buy and price drop  it goes back up it is a fulfilling feeling. but u only bought once. u will never average up because u have gotten the low.so let's assume out of 5 times u are profitable on 4. let's talk about the last  u will NEVER average down once only. firstly because the past 4 experience have told you average down will always make money eventually. so u avg down and drop somemore  u add somemore  somehow u add to the threshold of pain is too high and wonder what u have done and/or no more ammo and the price is still going against you. the 5th time pain is more than enough to wipe out past 4 times profit.note i said the past 4 times u will only add one time. either small profit or breakeven run and gleefully happy got out unscathed.not the 5th. your position is bigger  your stop loss don't exist  the swing is bigger. u took bigger losses in magnitude and quantity that a 80% success rate is not enough to save u.which scenario are you in? the company didn't change overnight or in past 1-2 weeks  only price changed. you have avg down till it is too painful or worried at the speed it is dropping u start to have doubts on all your positions that u decide to seek some advice or any reasoning why the drop. somehow hoping someone to tell u how good the result is how good the company is how nice tan sri is etc.some form of false assurance to convince you didn't make a mistakebut wonder why so many stuckists in medtecs? all in search of assurance and comfortyou aren't alone. but when worried  look back why u bought in the first place. hearsay or just uptrend price etcnonetheless  the basis isn't strong  if it is purely blind buying due to hype  do set a stop loss even for investments. at point of pain  cut and move on. regardless of it coming back after that  at least you got a plan  keep to the plan  it ensures longevity.ok loso long enough  good luck,btohqsg

personal thoughts after the ISDN profit guidance and samudera result last nightmanagement has discretion within a significant width on valuation and impairment on the pretext of prudency.in isdn case  they did impairment/writedown in 4Q citing impact from covid. the irony to me is their operation is in china and singapore. in 1Q china went through a lockdown but in april  isdn updated their business is better than ever.in singapore  the CB period lasted 2 months in 2Q. in their half year no impairment  in 9M update they made 15m profits. all is well till 4Q they decided to impair certain assets due to impact from covid. as a commoner retail investor  i cannot fathom or wrap my head around it. for full year the auditors appeared and suggested there should be impairments? as far as i can see  their profitability improved and clearly their assets are working pretty fine. There have been no mention of impairments in 9M  and suddenly it appeared in 4Q. i do not want to insinuate any hidden meaning but can just say  i can't get it.in samudera case  they impair 10m usd and literally eroded their 2H earnings totally. barring this impairment  they would have made 10m net profit and 17m for full year  50% higher than 1H as it is common knowledge the rates and demand is highest in a decade. 50% sounds like an underperformance in my opinion but still better than zero.they have not sold their ships that are put up for sale but the impairment is due to writedown from book value to selling price. makes me wonder why there is a specific sale price to mark down to and not through negotiations and upon completion of sale  the loss is taken into the books. same like the hundreds of asset sale i have seen over the years. would not even want to comment why the containerships are so worthless especially in times like this. just as above  i can't get itmanagement is key to a company's operations  prospects and valuation. it is only as good as the management ability and integrity.it has been disappointing to see listco using such discretion with indiscretion  pun intended though it is not at all funny to me. there is only so much a retail investor can look into and when something pops out which is totally out of research boundaries and guesstimates  it feels helpless  worthless and overwhelming sense of disappointment. it is not about the money  losses or erosion of profits. I always believe if you do things right  the money will come eventually.just a sense of jadedness. drink a coffee  move on to next result anticipation. plenty more to go. in search of greater integrity too,btohqsg
