I thought Best Denki under electronics for online purchase?,btohqsg
Cardup income tax qns: can I prepay more than the monthly amount ?,btohqsg
No. CardUp will strictly follow your submitted GIRO payment plan.,btohqsg
any idea which will be a better card after SC smart card nef? (UOB KF or DBS WWC?),btohqsg
Did you check mcc before making the purchase? It could have been a diff payment processor and used diff mcc.,btohqsg
What happens if someone does it eh,btohqsg
Check with UOB what‚Äôs the mcc of the transaction.,btohqsg
Lucky lo. If you need it to clock spending.,btohqsg
Cardup may reject your payment setup. You are required to submit your giro monthly payment plan to process ur tax payment.,btohqsg
Check under Heymax it‚Äôs 5732 which is under UOB PPV selected online transaction,btohqsg
Can i use HSBC revolution to pay for shopee payment and earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Not 100% accurate  chat with UOB and let us know. If it‚Äôs 5732  then appeal to get the 9x back.,btohqsg
I'd suggest linking ur HSBC Revo to heymax to verify mcc. Shopee has many mcc but mostly work for hsbc Revo. But in case it doesn't  can cancel transaction and repurchase.,btohqsg
Yes same I didn't receive Oct 1% giro. I used the chat  some automated bot replied with an announcement saying it will delay till 8Nov...but today alr 11 Nov liao,btohqsg
We all kenna scammed by HSBCKidding ofc. They prob had to calc 1% cashback by hand so give them some time.,btohqsg
It used to be quite fast. Within a week. Now more than a month alr and I'm scratching my head also thinking if I missed some criteria,btohqsg
any cc good to use for paying pub bills?,btohqsg
I jsut linked when i purchase it will automatically show if i can earn 4mpd? first time using it,btohqsg
Don't worry. Everyone is waiting so it's not you. üòÅ,btohqsg
Yes. It's a feature. It's called card maximizer or something like that.,btohqsg
Something like this. It works 90%-95% of the time. If u can see 10x points  it means mcc is correct and online.,btohqsg
possible to link amaze and citi to check if citi earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Only works w Visa cards.But then  amaze can test mcc by linking to empty wallet üòÜ,btohqsg
Any app like that for MC?Except amaze,btohqsg
You use amaze + empty wallet to test then use ur mc of choice to make payment.,btohqsg
I asked around  apparently alot of export phones are from HK and I think the biggest downside of the export phones are that there is no warranty...just pay abit more for local set with a peace of mind  ok la worth also,btohqsg
I‚Äôm going to assume you‚Äôre asking about Public Utilities Board bill - Singapore Power instead of drinking that type of pub üòÇüòÇUOB One credit card - there‚Äôs minimum spend of $500  $1 000 & $2 000 for 3 rebate tiers.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I would like to seek your advice please. I am helping my sister to clock the spending for the POSB rewards. Could anyone advise if contactless spending at ntuc are accepted as the spending please?,btohqsg
I think it is under the switch  spend and something promo,btohqsg
As long not excluded in t&c,btohqsg
Oh I didn't not sign up for this but I will go take a look then. Thank you.,btohqsg
Seems ok for contactless spending at ntuc,btohqsg
Hi can you please suggest best cards for accumulating milesFYII have Citi rewards  hsbc revolution and travel one and Amex krisflyer I am trying to accumulate miles in next 3 -4 months for a mile stone trip.,btohqsg
Thanks in advance  for your kind inputs,btohqsg
Need more info actually.What do you spend on? How much do u spend a month? And what milestone?,btohqsg
Thanks for response  I spend about 3-4K per month. I am planning to redeem those  points for my Europe trip. At present I have about 100k miles,btohqsg
Is signing up for UOB krisfkyer is good option ?,btohqsg
Biz class? 1 or more pax?Imo  UOB prvi is only guaranteed sign up bonus to get for UOB. Havent heard any one getting UOB first xxx for credit card in recent months.,btohqsg
2 pax Anthony :) yes I don‚Äôt have UOB card. I used to own it 4-5  years ago,btohqsg
Not fixated on biz class  I think it‚Äôs highly impossible to hit it. As I plan to travel mid next year ..,btohqsg
But you know better than me :),btohqsg
I'd suggest UOB prvi and dbs altitude for signup bonus. Can get close to 80k miles iirc. Then UOB set of cards like UOB lady solitaire  UOB visa signature  uob prefer platinum visa etc  UOB Kris flyer.,btohqsg
Read up on those then see if you have more questions,btohqsg
Is it better to enroll direct or through singsaver like sites,btohqsg
Just wondering  quick questionShould I get both UOB ladies and UOB PPV?Or should I just choose one of them?,btohqsg
Consider apply via honey money sg referral link. It helps support the channel.UOB prvi. This is via singsaver. Additional 50$ plus the usual miles. Remember to choose miles option. And send sms for annual fee option.https://t.me/HMSGHive/2086,btohqsg
Use cases different.UOB ppv: mainly mobile contactless  5$ rounding block  but mcc flexible.UOB lady: mcc restricted but one of the few can use for travel booking  contribute to uob one saving account cc spend.See ur situation,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing  definitely supporting the channel!Hmm noted that UOB PPV have 2 years of expiryUOB Lady = can book for travelI don‚Äôt spend much tbhMainly on food in CBD ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  occasionally groceries and online shopping I.e Shopee// TaobaoNot using UOB One yet thanks for C.F and SingLife ü§°Technically should consider 4mile/$ rather than miles card right? Since miles only like 1.2-1.4So should we put Citi rewards for day to day mobile / contactless? Since can pair with amaze too,btohqsg
Citi rewards+ amaze is a much more flexible card  except for cannot use to book flight/hotel/tour etc,btohqsg
If no UOB one acct  I'd say go with Citi rewards first.,btohqsg
