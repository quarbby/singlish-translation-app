When you say finances will be in SG forever  I assume you mean the finance job market will be in SG forever,btohqsg
At the very least  going to uni gives you opportunities to intern and gain working experience  give you overseas experiences  experiences with independent living   and gives you skills at managing projects  time management  learning,btohqsg
