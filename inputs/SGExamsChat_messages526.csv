hi i'm just here to ask whether the subreddit for sgexams will be participating in the blackout next week,btohqsg
the reddit blackout against 3rd party apps,btohqsg
Have then have don't have then don't have lor,btohqsg
On June 12th  many subreddits will be going dark to protest this policy. Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away permanently unless the issue is adequately addressed  since many moderators aren‚Äôt able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn‚Äôt something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because we love Reddit  and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.,btohqsg
hi so the current consensus from the mod team is that while we support the blackout (due to the importance reddit's recent actions have on 3rd party APIs)  we won't be shutting down r/sgexams for 48 hours as the subreddit is mainly a place for students to get help and we don't want that to go away for 48 hours and it is highly likely that the issue is not of great significance to the large majority of our userbase,btohqsg
we'll be putting out an official announcement on the reddit sometime over this weekend,btohqsg
ok thank you for your answer!,btohqsg

‚Äúlet them choose‚Äù option of what should cabin crew wear goes hard‚Ä¶later you see cabin crew wearing cargo pants or yoga pants,btohqsg
the infront of y= 0 and x = 0,btohqsg
The govt be playing a double edge sword,btohqsg
Either appease the older and likely more richer voters (increasing) and maintain the ‚Äúhdb is profit‚Äù stance or appease the younger crowd to maintain the idea of a ‚Äúliveable society to raise the young‚Äù,btohqsg
yea but how long can it last,btohqsg
The lingering issue here is how society has developed  back when SiT‚Äôs were first introduced. We were at the forefront of this new concept of a ‚ÄúHousing development board‚Äù‚Ä¶this impressive concept was what drew foreign investors to Singapore despite the fact hdb‚Äôs were only sold to Singaporeans.But now this totalitarian landscape has shifted and this concept of a ‚ÄúHDB‚Äù has been eclipsed in other nations around the world.,btohqsg
So this idea of appeasing the older generation no longer seem like it should take the forefront for housing policies and the direction of how housing should go,btohqsg
That is what many said during the 1997 AFC and 2008 GFC‚Ä¶during these times  the only property prices that dropped were private housing,btohqsg
And because of this outcome  in the 90s and into the early 2010s. The government started implementing various measures that all were targeted towards decreasing the price of private properties,btohqsg
How do you guys convince your old fashioned parents that engineering is useless,btohqsg
