Yes. I normally pay (most) before  just to keep the credit utilization low.,btohqsg
hmm interesting.. just seeking opinions.. cos some time back i wanted to purchase a big ticket item say 20k  but credit limit is 10k.. offer to pay 10k in advance so that the 20k transaction can be successful.. CS says cannot :>,btohqsg
Wah I do wonder if the transaction will go through first... Cos standard limit set is below that figure? Hahaha,btohqsg
any credit card to suggest if i always order food on grab and food panda ?,btohqsg
Can you share how you pay first? Is it you just transfer money into the card?,btohqsg
XNAP pair with applepay UOB one card  still valid for cash back right?,btohqsg
Why don't split the 3.5k between multiple cards,btohqsg
Also alot to consider such as how would you redeem your miles. Optimal redemption method such as going for biz/first ? Do you value business/first experience as compared to the cashback you would have accumulated? Eg. Do you rather use the money you saved from all the cashback on other things as compared to using miles to redeem for luxurious travel experience.,btohqsg
Some ppl may feel that they rather use (eg. 4k accumulated from cashback (random number) for other personal stuff that gives them better utility) as compared to using miles for biz/first class experience which is just for that few hours and probably sleeping majority of the time.,btohqsg
If possible  redeem the flight at the savers rate,btohqsg
Anybody knows of strategies to optimizing their miles for business expenses?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I am looking thru the chats and noticed that UOB One/OCBC 365 is best for utility payment. But I am not able to meet the OCBC365 min spend of $800 per month (because I am collecting miles) and I dont have UOB One account.The next best alternative will be the the POSB Everyday Capped at $3 per month.Qn: Recurring bill payments meaning i need to set up in the app to auto charge to my POSB Everyday Card or I just need to go in SP App to make the payment every month ?Also if there are any other cards that I might have missed  please enlighten me.Thanks all in advance!,btohqsg
Thanks for replying. I do use miles for travel. I'm considering if only 2k out of 3400 is applicable for bonus 4mpd.. maybe it's better the full 3400 used in Cashback of 3.3%.. cashback may generate better returns to buy air tickets with cash,btohqsg
Can I check if anyone knows what is the daily spending limit for amaze card ? Itâ€™s linked to Citibank,btohqsg
Can I check if anyone knows what is the optimum petrol station to received 4mpd and credit card discount?,btohqsg

Anyone knows why I can't transfer my funds from Revolut to Grab/Bank acc?,btohqsg
Well  you can  but if you topped up your funds using credit or debit card and transfer back to yourself too often Revolut may flag your account for suspension,btohqsg
Oh I jus signed up for Revolut today  but I can't seem to transfer my funds to bank acc,btohqsg

Anyone knows what happens for transferred KrisFlyer miles when the Kris+ shop issues a refund ðŸ¤¨,btohqsg

DBS Altitude card.2 miles per S$1 spent on overseas purchases in foreign currencyMiles are awarded in the form of DBS points which are awarded for every S$5 spentIf I spent $100 overseas in foreign dollar  I will be awarded 200 miles right?,btohqsg
ya but not worth it  you kena 3.25% forex fee. General recommendation is to use Amaze + CRMC,btohqsg
Why donâ€™t use HSBC revolution card directly instead of Amaza+CRMC? Both also offers 4 mpd,btohqsg
Guys I remembered seeing a promo for 4mpd extra for using Harvey Norman on Kris+ for the next week or so... But I can't seem to find the promo anywhere now. Did I dream of it? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
You mean HSBC also got 3.25% FX fee?,btohqsg
If I use CRMC stand alone  will I get 3.25% FX fee also?,btohqsg
So the big different between Amaze+CRMC and HSBC revolution is this 3.25% FX only?,btohqsg
there's subtle differences between the 4 mpd categories  but the savings of the 3.25% FX fee is quite big,btohqsg
No but good idea. Cos it's a one transaction spend .. monthly sub of aws,btohqsg
Can I check for uob one  is the base cashback fixed? E.g. If you spend 750$ on the card for 3 months  you'll still only get back $50 after 3rd quarter?,btohqsg
So it's not like an unlimited cashback thing  3.33 for 500 1000 and 2000 respectively huh,btohqsg
yes up to 3.33% quarterly rebate. Though can also get bonus rebate for specific merchants,btohqsg
Does anyone know if I will earn 4mpd from my telco like this?CRMC > Amaze > google pay > Giga app.,btohqsg
I think giga alr considered online?If mcc not allowed even if u do this loop don't make sense lol,btohqsg
yes  assuming can pay giga using googlepay.,btohqsg
Yes giga app allows google pay.,btohqsg
From what I know mcc will be different if setup recurring monthly payments,btohqsg
At least that's what I know. I might be wrong.,btohqsg
the issue is only online gets 4mpd  mcc should still be the same telco mcc which is not excluded,btohqsg
The category is under bills utilities & taxes when I bill it under my DBS Alti. I just changed it to Google pay with CRMC+Amaze. So I am not sure if I will earn 4mpd this way.,btohqsg
But on DBS Alti is monthly recurring payment.,btohqsg
that is not the mcc  for dbs can check mcc on ibanking chatbot,btohqsg
Hello gurus! If I pay my food using my Citibank cash back via shopback. Is it still considered as dining? Thanks!,btohqsg
