Yeah those with dct all have.,btohqsg
EV market will be very competitive in the next few years....,btohqsg
with more companies putting up new models...,btohqsg
Can you record the 7 bars too please?,btohqsg
I buying paste on my car,btohqsg
Not going to fix? Everyday you see the alert no wonder you feel that way sir. Unreliable is if you change that sensor  and very shortly after  that same sensor fails again.,btohqsg
that video is recorded weeks ago,btohqsg
u fix this . few month another light come up... reality of conti..must accept esp a old one.,btohqsg
just to show you the shift lights. late ri will record another one without those christmas lights,btohqsg
oxygen sensor changed when car is just one year old!,btohqsg
Almost apple to apple .. his is an E92 M3 which is a high performance car. even his onboard computer processor mss60 i think (or was it mss65) was legend. capable of handling massive loads of data from sensors around the car including suspension inputs  and capable of continuous adjustments of the car parameters,btohqsg
That why the sticker is nice,btohqsg
this is s85 - 2 cylinders. see this incredible machinehttps://youtu.be/6_LRuAgOAMc,btohqsg
so.. with all due respect to other cars  this has a lot of sensors for good reason and with climate  wear and tear  it is part of maintenance to replace them especially on the usual ductings  pipings  connectors  gaskets after some years,btohqsg
fantastic sound just like the v8.,btohqsg
Wow that V10‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ what a screamer üòçüòç,btohqsg
Solid mechanical engineering üëèüèª . That‚Äôs why I feel things like mechanical watches will always have a place and be valued more than digital or quartz watches,btohqsg
nice read. that's why that s65v8 is engine of the year for many  years,btohqsg
Yup   one my dream is to own a Cai Peng store and name it bbfa Cai Peng,btohqsg
Hi community members I have this catalyst system problem that result in check engine sign pop up every 2-3 days after I erased them. Anyone has encountered before and where and the cost of rectifying?,btohqsg
I have cleaned the exhaust pipe and change the filter  still same result,btohqsg
What part of the exhaust have you changed?,btohqsg
I have done it in Singapore and Malaysia workshop  they said catalytic converter. But I am not so sure,btohqsg
Something like this  but no cure,btohqsg
Maybe get your cat converter checked by an independent here. Usually just need to use cat con cleaner and can be done with it. If not  need to change sensor,btohqsg
Or remove your cat. Problem solved plus more power üòÜ just beware of inspection,btohqsg
Sensor changed after 2-3 days check engine sign still pop up,btohqsg
Ya the msia workshop said in msia all have them removed. But spore inspection sure fail,btohqsg
Make sure they changed your cat to a new one and cleaned out the pipes a bit in the process,btohqsg
Yupp because removing cat con can make your exhaust sound significantly better and has some performance gains too,btohqsg
I had mine removed last time  passed inspection. Now probably very strict,btohqsg
Afternoon! Is there anyway to check if a car was previously used as PHV?,btohqsg
Not so sure he change what. any bro know a sure cure workshop?,btohqsg
I spent a few hundred still not yet solved,btohqsg
But what if they change carplate number,btohqsg
+once the car is deregged as a phv  it won't show up,btohqsg
Recommend you to ask for service records in case mileage is high  can see service intervals that way which will have the mileage at each service. Can judge accordingly if it was serviced very very frequently or not,btohqsg
Thanks for the URL but it will not be listed once its removed/deregistered. Was wondering if I have missed out on any information. Thanks again! As for mileage  issue is the tweaking of mileage. Service records  also hard to judge since user/owner can tweak mileage before going back to the workshop. Really all odds against the buyer of used cars. Not easy.,btohqsg
The usual advise of skip used car dealers that don't allow workshop inspection. Skip used car dealers that require deposit because hard to get back if don't go through. While these are sound advice  the reality of being able to do these  with the used car dealers are far fetched. 0 out 3 today.,btohqsg
Well  you can always do an inspection to check if the miles are accurate or not  many mechanics can tell basis the actual condition of parts such as suspension  control arms  etc. Another way to judge by yourself is interior condition  but this is a bit harder for cars with PU leather as it doesn't age the same way. Can also look at how the dealer is  many dealers and areas with dealers are known to be notorious for Odo tampering. Also most phv drivers don't care to reverse the Odo before every service so if you can check  you will be able to see how regular the intervals were and figure out,btohqsg
It really depends on how hard you look  I have dealt with a few used car dealers in the recent past and they were happy to oblige to any inspection requests of mine/transparent in their deals. Any dealer that felt shady  just walk away,btohqsg
Yes. Guess more legwork required! üòù,btohqsg
change oil one year later! 12000 km.,btohqsg
Unless you buys car models which PHV drivers willl surely not use to drive as PHV one üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Still possible bro. Can look some more. Have faith üòÅ,btohqsg
what is a good scanner for BMW and mazda?,btohqsg
primarily for BMW. i want to know what's in there,btohqsg
thatis american. can work on euro cars?,btohqsg
Good mainly for check codes and some customisation,btohqsg
Should check if it supports different models.,btohqsg
