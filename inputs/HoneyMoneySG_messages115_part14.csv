Hi guys  I'm new to this community  wanted to hear from gurus on advices. I'm reaching FRS soon and I'm planning to use excess balance from 20k in OA to buy t-bill. Is it wise to keep buying t-bill (if the interest rates are favourable) so that I can hit ERS? Or else  what should I do with the excess in OA?,btohqsg
no mentioned on insurance when i search through the TnC.,btohqsg
Insurance is not excluded but  the question is more of who accepts AMEX for recurring premiums?,btohqsg

Hi  my citi rewards points from citi rewards visa recently expired due to the 5 years period. What is the new expiry date for the points earned after this? Is it a new 5 years period counting from now? Thanks,btohqsg
I m new to citi rewards points  how do i check if my specific txn earn me the necessary 4mpd points? I know we can check MCCs and etc.. just want to verify that sometimes the txn garners me the necessary points as well. Anyone know where in the app i can check this? Or i have to memorise the total number of points i have?,btohqsg
There used to be a rewards portal to check  but I don‚Äôt think you can do so transaction by transaction anymore after the portal was removed,btohqsg
ic.. then can share whats the next best way to track or monitor the various txns? The idea is to do a simple check and not being short changed.. anyone knows?,btohqsg
I think it can only be done on an aggregated basis when you receive your statement each month,btohqsg
Manually add the pts urself. Else can ask the chat but that needs to wait a bit.,btohqsg

Hi guru  wanted to ask if it is very common for Citi card to have fraudulent transaction? Just opened CRMC 2 months ago and been using it with amaze.How long does the replacement card take to get mailed to you? Because CRMC is my main card with the other cc being HSBC revol and UOB Evol. If is worth it get a backup standby card in the event citi cards have fraudulent transactions again in the future?,btohqsg

What is the amt u intend to spend,btohqsg
Did a search and went online but it wasn't clear so have to try my luck and ask here. If I were to open an HSBC ega account today and sign up for the latest offer I suppose for the additional 1% interest. May I ask how would the interest be calculated please? My May average balance would be 0 and I am hoping to withdraw it before the end of July assuming that uob has an offer for fresh funds for the next quarter on 1st July.2) Am I also right to say that I can fulfill the 1% additional interest by doing 5 fund transfer to say my posb account please?Thank you in advance.,btohqsg
My exp is that citi sent new card within 3 biz days. You already had other cc. Unless you have specific mile accumulation goal in mind  no need new backup cards.,btohqsg
Quite common along with UOB cards as well.,btohqsg
#DP#UOBKFCC#UOBKrisflyer CCI am glad to be able to be the confirmed DP that Amaze + UOB Krisflyer CC can indeed clock the $800 SIA Group spending requirements for UOB Krisflyer Credit Card.,btohqsg
yes. And need to sms register for 3.4%,btohqsg
So u pay in fcy or the 1 percent extra fee?,btohqsg
it was a JPY transaction  hence i tagged on Amaze.If it was in SGD  I would have use UOB Krisflyer CC naked,btohqsg
At least u add to the data point,btohqsg
"Thank you but could I check if I would get the ""full"" interest if I were to transfer what I have to my uob account say on the 29 or 30th July please?",btohqsg
Why not just wait for end of Jun to open and deposit for Jul? Then on the last day of Jul deposit to UOB for the promo  if there is one.Anyway if your money is still in UOB right now  the monies that's still in account would be invalid for incremental fresh funds already.,btohqsg
yeah honestly i was unsure myself..because CONFIRM Amaze + UOBKFCC at OTA won't work.and i had to 'try it' anyway since the $4k transaction cannot be handle by UOB Lady or any other card due to max capTO BE CLEAR  this works at SQ doesn't mean it will work at Scoot ah.. BE WARNED.,btohqsg
No. The moment you deposit late or withdraw early  your MAB will drop based on the number of days your monies is in or not in the account.And depositing early (before the start of the month) will also affect the incremental MAB calculations for Everyday+ Cashback reward.,btohqsg
For Jun get full 3.4%+1 on Jun Monthly Average Balance (MAB)For Jul get 3.4% on Jul MAB and 1% on the incremental MAB compared to Jun MAB.,btohqsg
