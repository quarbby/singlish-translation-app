Make sure you buy fit gk,btohqsg
I changing to jdm wing haha.,btohqsg
still got few years to go b4 can go think about buying car,btohqsg
The spring rate I hear different things from different people. Some say for street should go soft  some say should go hard,btohqsg
But hard maybe faster rotation  I could be wrong,btohqsg
yeah i think turns btr cause theres less weight shift,btohqsg
so easier for thr car to suddenly change direction,btohqsg
But straight not fun. Super bumpy,btohqsg
Not much body roll gives you better confidence in turning lo. Turn easy or not idk,btohqsg
idk i nvr drive car all ik is half baked theory so ya,btohqsg
Coilover is the best mod you can do to your car,btohqsg
yeah it changes drivability and comfortability,btohqsg
You'll feel the difference in a few years time,btohqsg
yes i hope by then i buy car isnt like buying a hdb,btohqsg
lowkey considering sti wrx look very sexy the newer model,btohqsg
Road use soft good 4 wheel always has grip but if stiff car feel stable and if oversteer with experience easier to counter. High speed bend soft also better because car bounces tyre less contact lose grip. Unless is track smooth,btohqsg
Yes make u feel so stable much less roll will go faster and lose grip then things happen. Unless you experience enough,btohqsg
So soft for noob  stiff for pro,btohqsg
but then again i think also whst u lookijt for lah,btohqsg
I haven't kena oversteer or anything yet. But I know how to counter easy,btohqsg
how fast u going in sg road turns,btohqsg
Not exactly but something like tat. On road not too hard coz uneven,btohqsg
Most cars in sg are front wheel  so to loose control of grip are less likely to happen. If happens  don't jam brake it makes things worse,btohqsg
If you drive rear wheel then you can let go pedal and depress brakes to slow down to save yourself,btohqsg
Next time meet up I can share some experience with u all if you all don‚Äôt mind,btohqsg
if u brake one front wheel u will lose grip righth,btohqsg
cause wheel might lock up or not enough grip cause yr tryna stop and turn,btohqsg
Don't jam brake. Just brake to slow down only.,btohqsg
can make more hrspower can liao,btohqsg
Rear wheel cars go sliding don't go jam brake üòÇüòÇüòÇ if jam brake cfm you donut liao,btohqsg
Adding to this  press abit of gas to make your car align back to straight will do,btohqsg
Nvr drove one idk how it works,btohqsg
sounds abit hard if u panic when it happens,btohqsg
AWD ‚òùÔ∏èTorque I transfer all to rear,btohqsg
My car did try to slide b4  I just step on abit and my car stop sliding,btohqsg
maybe might accidentally be a drift god uk,btohqsg
Lols my car front wheel drive la,btohqsg
start doing ken block gykmma after losing control for abit,btohqsg
Counter too muchTyre grip back that‚Äôs why,btohqsg
He didn't manage to drift  the wheel loose grip  when it slows down he tot can add power to speed up  but little did he know his wheel grip back and steering wheel didn't return to original position and bam  crash,btohqsg
Is it harder to drift in fwd?,btohqsg
cause where yr directing yhe car and adding power is on thr same axle,btohqsg
so its like all yr grip is alr on the front,btohqsg
then when u add more power or less power yr car might grip up more??? cause u only pulling the back tires bah,btohqsg
Pvc your rear wheel and you can drift üëçüèª,btohqsg
Go empty heavy industries carpark on rainy days put cone. Tats how i learn last time and watch option VCR VCD,btohqsg
Add more speed will get back the grip  let it slow down will also help but it takes longer time because it need to makes the rear wheel stop sliding,btohqsg
its fwd if u turn thr bike the other way ard,btohqsg
u had me in the first half,btohqsg
have yr seen the vid of some guy on a bike he go like 200km/h plus then he let it go he seat and fave the back,btohqsg
Can am 3 wheels  wide enough like a car,btohqsg
Your bike most practical la bro,btohqsg
S4 spec 3 with yoshi or blue flame pipe bro,btohqsg
Those ice cream below your hdb block,btohqsg
Last time On the way sepang was driving my spec C gear box design for track so top speed was restricted to approx. 2753 super bike with ppl behind overtake me slowly can‚Äôt even see their tail lights ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg

Douyin last time keep saying cfmoto 250 sport bike very good,btohqsg

China really getting up their game,btohqsg
But I still like touring bikes lols,btohqsg

Anybody knows how to debadge cleanly,btohqsg
I think only 4 emblem LOL,btohqsg

But you need to soak it,btohqsg
But will remove the sticky tape?,btohqsg
Zippo also canUse car polish also canWD40 also can,btohqsg
2nd time our group kena like this,btohqsg

I think nwadays jam 1hr minimum.,btohqsg
I also want do on my car,btohqsg
My car cannot start but push start button. But got all the lights and all but unable to start.,btohqsg
Battery last year about dec change,btohqsg
But even tho  Past 1 week never drove but than  yesterday drive still ok and earlier on start no problem is afterwards want go out than cant even start the engine,btohqsg
If its a old car and u dun drive..best to unplug the battery,btohqsg
Maybe can try to jump start,btohqsg
I can do liao  I have hotel experience talking to people  need take car license can oredy,btohqsg
Never say pay roughly how much,btohqsg
this is a very vague question,btohqsg
any upgrade that changes the part from stock to aftermarket,btohqsg
still  depends on what kind. aesthetics  performance? just stickers or full blown wrap  overlay  bodykit etc. from $100s to few ks,btohqsg
aesthetic annd Performance bah the major stuff,btohqsg
if you want a really rough gauge  my expenditure so far around $5k since i got the car in Jan,btohqsg
ooo icic what mods have u done?,btohqsg
this is excluding any wear & tear,btohqsg
Wah after the charity run i nvr even see youü§£,btohqsg

usually i have something on too üòÇ,btohqsg
Ahh okay u coming for scd meet 25thüßêüòÉ ?,btohqsg

"""Photo edited to have driving effects"" HAHAHAA",btohqsg
i from the road so far can feel,btohqsg
like my car anot green and tall,btohqsg
I nv sat in 1 before,btohqsg

My girlfriend take mrt from her workplace legit faster than i drive her home,btohqsg
true but car mah don't have to see ppl n stuff,btohqsg
is carro somewhere there? i oppo kranji mrt rn,btohqsg
And at the end is carros,btohqsg
Thats why always got TP camp that road,btohqsg
Just surprised why the last meet never,btohqsg
they rlly tryna get rid of our fun,btohqsg
even tho we do in ulu area alr,btohqsg
it's not about the event itself,btohqsg
they just wanna clamp down on mods,btohqsg
and that road famous for people pulling when they exit carros,btohqsg
The decathlon meet was also the same,btohqsg
they were there just to make sure people don't do stupid things,btohqsg
gonna have ppl like my age think they dam good at driving end up crash their car also,btohqsg
TP is ok. LTA is the one,btohqsg
TP is to catch the speeding,btohqsg
then if lta comr check yr car u need to have all the certificate n stuff in ur car saying yr mods r legal ah,btohqsg
open bonnet and see under carriage,btohqsg
well as long u get yr mods legally nth fear,btohqsg
whats yr recc garage to mod car,btohqsg
if they have reason to believe you have illegal mod  they still can call you to inspection,btohqsg
It depends on ur car uses what brands of mods. What what brands you want to go for,btohqsg
try to find a good workshop and stick to it,btohqsg
Your 33s is done up at garage R?,btohqsg
i nv went back to them haha,btohqsg
then your 33s go where mod now?,btohqsg
Till now I've nv seen your 33s before sia,btohqsg
it's not in my hands liao,btohqsg
i got enough legs for 1 car only haha,btohqsg
Now it looks like that üò¨,btohqsg
i was planning on Regas too. but in silver,btohqsg
the new owner and my thoughts almost same haha,btohqsg
the blue on the car is very nice too,btohqsg
i wanna get jap rims for my bmw but the current rims would be wasted.,btohqsg
if it's stock  i still dont mind to change.,btohqsg
must thank the ex owner haha,btohqsg
otherwise i'll aim advan rg II,btohqsg
I also very gian to buy 1,btohqsg
good size. got a lot of options,btohqsg
should update from your te37 style üåö,btohqsg
But now advans also very common,btohqsg
Many reps coming out with advans,btohqsg
the flat face looks better than the concave design,btohqsg
In sg i see the te37 on 2007 vios  in melaka i see it on rusty proton saga,btohqsg
How do you guys define reps? Not the original owner of the design but produces it = rep?,btohqsg
TE37 not from rays = rep lo,btohqsg
It's like boobs  both same size but one is silicon üòÇ look same feel different,btohqsg
Interesting cause a lot of brands come up with same design,btohqsg
So all are reps except for the original design,btohqsg
these other brands probably just reverse engineer it from the original,btohqsg
Mine like not concave not flat,btohqsg
less effort on their part thus can sell cheaper,btohqsg
mine also rep... save the money for other mods better haha,btohqsg
Mine lucky came with the car,btohqsg
Honestly u buy 1 set of rep = 1 pc of ori,btohqsg
But the rep must have recognitions ma,btohqsg
Rota also another VIA JWL certified,btohqsg
Maybe I‚Äôm cheap but if the construction quality is the same with accreditations it‚Äôs good enough imo,btohqsg
I think as long as it's a known brand of reps,btohqsg
Oh and as long as they don‚Äôt brand it as the originals,btohqsg
Mine when got the car I didn't know anything about ce28. Only after I got it then I found out how lucky I was. Would have been nice if the number plate also came along. But well...,btohqsg
I honestly question how much effort went into that design of 6 rectangular spokes,btohqsg
Probably the impressive part is the weight which they economized the material required to deliver the load limit,btohqsg
it's nice until it was overused. but then  overused because it's nice.,btohqsg
i think it's a very versatile design since it's quite simply,btohqsg
Sounds like the H belt that every insurance agent wears,btohqsg
"""SEMA 2019: TE37 All Of The Things - Speedhunters""http://www.speedhunters.com/2019/11/sema-2019-te37-all-of-the-things/",btohqsg
For those people with this name in the list please tag your telegram id beside your name- Alex TT (Alex Yap)- Brandon (bk0519)- Christopher (ChrizJuin84)- Eugene ( iabbear )- Edmund- xannoyingx (XxxXxxxxx)- Genie,btohqsg
TE37 looks good on almost all JDMs,btohqsg
I hope that means good  if so thanks üòä  if not  i will try and do better üòÉ,btohqsg
Have to.. else a lot of brake dust to clean ü§£,btohqsg
with brake dust it'll go from gloss to matte üíÄ,btohqsg
i think that's silver but it looks better than black,btohqsg
Hahaha my car so small. Cannot la,btohqsg
Replica may look the same  just the material the use to replicate the rims,btohqsg
But to know if its replicate or not,btohqsg
Either have sticker on the rims,btohqsg
when you use 100% of your brain,btohqsg
But nowadays replica rims looks so identical to the ori,btohqsg
Depends lor. Its like branded bag have ‚Äútriple A‚Äù,btohqsg
another point of consideration is the QC,btohqsg
Saw a te37 the other day  looked fine until u realize there are 2 PCD,btohqsg
i've seen ori that offer dual pcd too,btohqsg
4 bolt but has the 5x113.6,btohqsg
How can a rim have 2 pcd,btohqsg
U either have 4 or 5 bolt,btohqsg
Usually the thai one is better and more identitcal,btohqsg
The one i was looking at had 4 bolts. Then i saw the pcd 4x100‚Ä¶ then oei? How come further along also write 5x113.6,btohqsg
The taiwan one just try to avoid,btohqsg
what about those that swg bring in?,btohqsg
In the end  u run reps from unknown factory  it becomes a safety issue,btohqsg
Its a world of difference wearing a chiong gucci t shirt and running your 1.5 ton vehicle on dubious rims,btohqsg
