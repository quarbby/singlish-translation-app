experience and pay not directly co-related one,btohqsg
Some area with specialised expertise are getting more,btohqsg
Those general application dev lots of people can do,btohqsg
No meh? How can fresh grad with no experience be paid same as 3yo staff with experience in same company?,btohqsg
got many factors... experience. demand/supply. retention rate. potential growth/ gov subsidies / attract new comers,btohqsg
it is easier to give new pay then to restructure the pay of the existing,btohqsg
Think they adjust the salary of experienced staff too  just ended up slightly above new ones,btohqsg
and it is this thinking .. that's why singapore SME cannot hire,btohqsg
because they are not willing to increase anyone's pay at all,btohqsg
Now it good demand  good time to jump ship too with increment,btohqsg
Then Mgt lazy lor. Like this sure existing staff jump ship. Experienced staff means less mistakes made so less losses,btohqsg
You must have certain skill set harder to find in the market to justify for special market value,btohqsg
That is true but I rather increase pay of my existing staff than to hire new staff in that case,btohqsg
There will be a point where over supply. This happened many years back,btohqsg
I get better loyalty n less mistakes made,btohqsg
In most MNC though   the boss don't get to decide pay,btohqsg
The staff working under me since 1990 never leave company,btohqsg
They keep taking in FT and our uni intake increasing  I'm worried a point our local grad can't get a job here,btohqsg
That's true. That's when they opened the floodgates,btohqsg
I can safely let them do the job without worrying much,btohqsg
You must be a very good boss,btohqsg
Will have saturation one.. when current batch finish studying. Let's say start 2020.. so..2024/2025,btohqsg
I prepare my escape road first,btohqsg
Experience is accumulated year after year with mistakes made n learnt along the way. That is precious,btohqsg
Might be a case u are experience and undervalue. So u need to go other Coy to revalue yourself.,btohqsg
You don't worry  by then u establish a position already,btohqsg
Sigh.. then if change too much. HR also flag red,btohqsg
I always think highly of Sam üëçüôè,btohqsg
Depends.  2yrs ago I went to another Coy to revalue myself. The interviewer said I am in Coy for 13yrs and worried that I may not be able to adjust to their hectic jobscope.  Yum gong,btohqsg
The interviewer said I am in my comfort zone. Lol. Knn,btohqsg
Tats y don't stay too long in a job,btohqsg
i think the average for Software engineer now is 2 years,btohqsg
heard somewhere that anymore than 2 years is a bonus to the company in terms of retention lol,btohqsg
What programming language are u using,btohqsg
Want to jump  do by 5th year best,btohqsg
Any reason why 5th year best?,btohqsg
Yeah~Honestly I‚Äôd top up.. But can‚Äôt even afford Cai Peng these days.. üòÜ,btohqsg
I'm old school kind. C/C++/Javaon Linux and C# on windows,btohqsg
Nowadays got a niche on C++ which is good,btohqsg
My boss was telling me he had troubles finding c++ devs,btohqsg
And the young ones are python and JavaScript,btohqsg
Also got learn JavaScript in my free time ah,btohqsg
C+ and Python combi is the hot favourite nowadays,btohqsg
C++ still ok. Those banks still using AS400 even harder to find people,btohqsg
Some of the original programmer pass away already,btohqsg
Should be very easy to move around  if you want,btohqsg
Really never expect to find so many in touch with the software field here,btohqsg
Singles buy house really shag..From housing costs to day-to-day expenses.. No matter how hard I punch the calculator.. Nothing seems right.. HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
The one service app feedback on safe distancing  no response and update  so don't know got follow up or not,btohqsg
all eras are connected to each other,btohqsg
