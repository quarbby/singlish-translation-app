i dont even know what ib is,btohqsg
IB (international baccalaureate) studies differ a lot from the normal education scheme so you can really use that as reference but no need to feel ashamed ahaha,btohqsg
when i went to tuition  my works was completely different from other students,btohqsg
so i started to lose hope abt the school and probably burden my mom,btohqsg
ah this is actually very normal to encounter during studying with the help of tuition,btohqsg
and don't lose all hope because it's definitely not a lost case,btohqsg
i used to think that the study methods i used to use in my previous batch (2006)  before i retained a year (2007 batch now) due to personal reasons  was feasible to use in exams so it was harder to adjust,btohqsg
especially since 2006 was the last of the old school type syllabus and 2007 was the newer implementation of the answer & marking scheme for most subjects,btohqsg

Has anyone known any person who retaked their O levels in NS? What happens after 1 year of NS and they go to poly? Or they continue NS and then after the 2 years then they go poly?,btohqsg
Next year i turn 18 and i plan to retake my O levels for only my chinese subject. Im not sure what will happen if next year i get good grades and whether i get deferment in the middle of Ns or not.,btohqsg
cause they told me i have to go NS next year the moment i turn 18,btohqsg
so like if i already go there for 1 year  then i take my O's  then do i return to finish NS or completely postpone it is my question,btohqsg
Closest I have heard is A levels. Have heard of cases of those retaking A levels during NS. None of them were my friends though  but there were of course stories about them online.,btohqsg
If I am not wrong  technically in NS  you are allowed to take leave to take an examination if you talk to your supervisor about it beforehand,btohqsg
But I think for this case  most common case I have seen is they complete NS and then do poly. I dont think is possible to go to poly after serving 1 yr of NS and then come back to NS again,btohqsg
Pes A/B + pass IPPT => 1 yrs 10 mnthsRemainder (i.e. Pes C/E or nvr pass IPPT) => 2 yrs,btohqsg

junior... the scoring is not according to subject amount  but grading scores :),btohqsg
if 1-2 marks away from cut off pnt  cn try dae,btohqsg
having 6 or 7 subjects is no difference,btohqsg
as long as below 26 pnts can still enter,btohqsg
1. dae does not work for private candidate,btohqsg
2. below 26 ofc can enter even 28 can enter nursing poly,btohqsg
i’m in poly. i hear frm my peers they dae even tho they r private candidate. dae is not hitting the cut off pnts for a course. e.g media cut off point is 16 but u score 18. u can try dae and they still accept it,btohqsg
u ask fr opinion u don’t be rude,btohqsg
you cant dae without a school,btohqsg
private candidate is different from sch candidate,btohqsg
i was sch candidate. dae also works for poly transfer students. if u r not sure  then call the poly admission,btohqsg
If your not sure  do not spread fake news,btohqsg
"also coming from somebody who believed that ""amount of subjects>5 enough to go poly"" i dont think you have provided any valuable feedback",btohqsg
u gotta be grateful ppl are trying to help you whether u think is nonsense or not. don’t be rude LOL. i misread one subj to retake as one less subj. if u think it’s invaluable feedback  u can voice it out w/o sounding it rude and mocking. i’m a student in poly  not a poly advisor / ecg counsellor so take it w a pinch of salt. i tell u what i know or heard of. i’m not free to check whether this is true or not. although i’m studying  i still help you out. a quick google search shows that private candidate also still can do dae except those who accepted an offer and withdrawn the offer at eae so maybe improve on your googling .https://www.sp.edu.sg/sp/admissions/admissions-exercises/admission-criteria/by-qualification#:~:text=Singapore%20Citizens%20and%20Permanent%20Residents to%20apply%20under%20this%20exercise.&text=%5BDAE%20not%20applicable%20to%20those O'%20Levels%20as%20private%20candidates.,btohqsg
In the article it clearly states private candidates are only eligible for JAE O N L Y,btohqsg
read the screenshot i sent u,btohqsg
you keep thinking you are right but in the end the odds are against you,btohqsg
u call the poly admission officer up. if u ask and call them  they will js clear yr doubts,btohqsg
then u ask ur sec sch teacher lor,btohqsg
you focused on the wrong column,btohqsg
I already knew from my sec teacher,btohqsg
and i didnt ask for whether or not dae is applicable,btohqsg
you are the boy who asked ME whether it is applicable or not,btohqsg
show me the right column for private candidates then,btohqsg
cause that is the only column,btohqsg
js shows ur entilted. even other ppl screenshot for u  u still laugh at ppl.,btohqsg
i know cause dae is applicable to even international students,btohqsg
i don't get why you're being so paggro with seeking alternative answers,btohqsg
in regards to not liking the answers you hear,btohqsg
First you implied that if someone studies more than 5 subjects  they can go poly instantly. Thats invalid.Secondly you said that priv candidates can use DAE to join poly. That is also invalid.Lastly you shown this article which proves that priv candidates cannot take DAE.,btohqsg
yeah lol don’t get why he’s so rude,btohqsg
spreading false knowledge and refusing to believe the correct information,btohqsg
the first implication is usually for students who take more than 5 subjects and do well in their national exams but obviously it won't apply for all scenarios (l1r4 for most  even N(A) uses a similar concept but with ELMAB3 unless jc which uses l1r5)your information as for the second statement about dae being invalid for private candidates is also outdated,btohqsg
so how do you use dae for private candidates?,btohqsg
because as of 2024 October it is not true to have DAE for private candidates sitting for O levels.,btohqsg
Those instructions are for SCHOOl candidates,btohqsg
you're just learning all the hearsay from your teachers you approached asking briefly about this,btohqsg
Priv candidates is not affiliated with gov schools  hence DAE is never applicable.,btohqsg
That does not imply the same thing as private candidates who came from secondary school,btohqsg
do private candidates not get stationed at ACTUAL schools as their exam centre to sit for papers and collect results?,btohqsg
your logic is not enough to validate your reasoning,btohqsg
go for it if you're interested,btohqsg
cuz I need more info on the programme,btohqsg
do you understand what your saying?,btohqsg
i think i made my points pretty simply and clearly enough,btohqsg
they get stationed at schools for their final exams (O levels) and then walk off after the paper. Which in conlcusion has got nothing to do with DAE since its only for taking exams.,btohqsg
more like you aren't getting where everyone is coming from and keep inferring assumptions based on the things you know,btohqsg
not fighting sial but this fella wants to keep carrying on,btohqsg
i wanna continue with my korean romfan 😭,btohqsg
it’s like speaking to a wall,btohqsg
update from my peers  you can dae as private,btohqsg
the reason why i got confused is because the article you sent stated that singapore poly only accepts JAE from private candidates but after research it seems that all schools allow for dae but its compulsory to have be in a nitec course (3.5+) or higher nitec course (2.0+) to enlist for DAE into poly. For private candidates without being in Ite they can only go jae route.,btohqsg
Your point of private candidate taking dae is valid. But in my case since im not an ite student taking private candidate i dont think i am eligible for DAE into poly unfortunately. Correct me if these info are wrong.,btohqsg
Anyone who retake O/N levels but never show up?,btohqsg
Will they call my home or nt? I worried parents will know 😔,btohqsg

Hi  asking for a friend:What's the results/consequences when you fail N-Level English? Basically what are your options on where you can go and where you can't (ITE/Poly/S5) TIA!,btohqsg
I'm not at all sure  but is retaking an option?,btohqsg
I've heard some retake and some just really take whatever they are offered,btohqsg
Im pretty sure sec 5 is still an option as long as emb3 < 20  but then again if he is struggling with n level English  o level english is gonna be a huge jump,btohqsg
Poly is definitely out of the question. N levels to poly you need emb3 < 11 or something so its a basic requirement that you need to pass (or do well) in every subject taken,btohqsg
does anyone know if stalford tuition is a good centre,btohqsg
ITE DPP (higher nitec) requires a grade 4 for every subject iirc  but he could consider nitec,btohqsg
But this is like from my knowledge almost a good decade ago already LOL but idt anything has changed,btohqsg
Yeah no worries I don't think much changed.. did mine last year managed to get 18pts and a decent 3yearHN course after,btohqsg
Its alright many of my friends too wanted to escape the hell that is O levels and went straight to HN,btohqsg
They arent doing too bad now,btohqsg
Personally am alot happier cos I get lots of opportunities to do what I want and what i've been thinking of so it's quite awesome,btohqsg
Is it worth it to go to 42 Singapore for a last shot at university?,btohqsg
So SUTD and Ecole 42 tied up to bring over the Ecole 42 model (which leads to the French equivalent of a Bachelor's) to Singapore as 42 Singapore,btohqsg
It's even free  which makes me tempted to try it out as a last shot at something resembling university,btohqsg
I once taught at one of the branches before for half a year.Felt that branch was a bit not that well managed. They gave me 3 pure physics and 3 combined sci physics in the same class when it was very near exams. And I was new to group tuition at that time.And no materials provided. So I was quite at a loss because pure and combi physics were very different and shouldn't be put together this way.,btohqsg
Maybe cus they have so many branches?,btohqsg
I also did relief for one of the teachers for one of the branches.Throughout the lesson  students were only asking for answers to explanation questions to be written on the board for copying  and not looking to completely understanding it for some reason.Anyway that formed the basis of my Explain That book.,btohqsg
that particular branch closed down already,btohqsg
other branches might probably be OK to be fair.,btohqsg
Hihihi  it is possible to get into nus engineering as an arts student,btohqsg
so theres no like book made for students by the centre like rmss?,btohqsg
as long as u meet the prereq subject grades and have sufficient score  I don't see why not,btohqsg
that time no. Now I not sure.,btohqsg
i kinda scared cuz my mum forcing me to go n it looks p weird,btohqsg
they supposedly have star tutors at some branches. Not sure which branch,btohqsg
oo okok did ur students back then like have impressive grades aft studying there?,btohqsg

Hi my friend in rp got his EAE offer for engineering with E8 english- I think it depends on the batch,btohqsg
how much did your friend usually score for his English in prelims ?,btohqsg
I am not sure sorry but his English is not the strongest 😭,btohqsg
I would say don't think so hard for now  go prepare for your other papers and relax if you don't have any other papers. O Levels isn't the end of the road. There are still other ways to achieve your goal💪,btohqsg
dw abt ur results. Study hard for remaining paper.,btohqsg
From my understanding is  you can still enter jc or poly but in your first yr of jc or poly  you have to retake O level English again,btohqsg
Stress will make you burn out easily and unable to concentrate for next paper,btohqsg
Idk if applicable for poly but one of my china friend from jc kena that before,btohqsg
He had to retake O level English during his J1,btohqsg
You probably would only obtain those offers if you appeal directly with the institution. But it's not the end of the world ya  the education system today is not the same it was 10 years ago.,btohqsg
Nope. U can still enter poly w d7 based on poly website. Some course ask u to retake and some wont but u have to do English express language course in sem 1 at least fr np,btohqsg
It is bruh   I keep thinking what the point of studying if can't make it anywhere ...,btohqsg
There is a lot of pathways now to achieve your dream. Don't just stop at O Levels friend :),btohqsg
I myself took a slightly longer route  being a NA student and going to poly. I still end up in studying in a University.,btohqsg
it's even more wasted to not keep working based on an assumption of yours,btohqsg
there's nothing absolutely concrete indicating how you did that,btohqsg
Cross the bridge when the time comes. For now do your best for the rest of your papers. What's done is done.,btohqsg
No point crying over something that's done already,btohqsg
I've been there before  and I told myself that I gave my best  and whatever results come my way  I'll just take it in my stride. Couple of my classmates cried because they didn't get the result they wanted  but they took it in their stride  did what they could and came out a better version of themselves.,btohqsg

"umm underlining isn't mandatory in English Paper 1 editing  O or N level wisei checked past papers and usually it's more of a preference where students have to highlight (not literally) the incorrect word  (spelling or grammar wise) usually done either by underlining or circlingas of last year's English O level Paper 1 Section A of Editing  the question hinged:""If there is NO error in a line  put a tick (✔) in the space provided.If the line is incorrect  circle the incorrect word and write the correct word in the space provided.The correct word you providemust not change the original meaningof the sentence""According to the O level English TYS (Ten Year Series) I peeked from my younger brother's desk lol",btohqsg

CNA TODAY finds out:                                MOE will roll out new device management apps to students’ Chromebooks and iPads from November 2024 and January 2025  respectively. More details on the apps:,btohqsg
@iSean97what do you think of these news?,btohqsg
how is there finals rn lol,btohqsg
from the headlines what interest me might be- the 4k people in SG using vapes.- Score O level Chinese A1 but don't know how to communicate with it seems wrong- MOE needs Chromebooks/iPads to have additional management software  seems abit overboard. The Chromebook/iPad is property of the school/MOE or students' parents own paid items?,btohqsg
- also isn't vapes are banned in Singapore? Cigarettes I think still exists right...?,btohqsg
most likely would be intercepted at the airport security I guess.,btohqsg
the MOE thing is relevant to the school issued devices not their own ones,btohqsg
it’s just a replacement for the previous one that had a cybersecurity issue,btohqsg
but the iPads/Chromebook is loaned device to the kids or what.,btohqsg
ok la. singapore government got this program. but surely for iPads would have many cracked screens already  being so fragile lel,btohqsg
"My friends worked for BAT  develops vape pens for Europe market. He doesn't vape  but is his ""child"" product. Sadly he can't bring back his ""kids"" from our Europe trip  since we need to transit in Singapore 😂",btohqsg
ok to clarify it’s not loan per se. they use their edusave funds to get it at a lower price then during the duration of sec sch it’s under their guidelines like the management app etc,btohqsg
once they graduate the software gets removed  device gets reset and they can keep using as normal,btohqsg
so the management software is like the T&C for being able to use edusave for it,btohqsg
seems like a good ownership program.,btohqsg
means the iPad is for 4-5 years in Secondary School right...?,btohqsg
i believe so but not completely sure,btohqsg
interesting. well  4-5 years use in Class ok la. The most basic 64GB iPad only costs about <S$700 + apple pencil + keyboard. somemore with some Gov. Initiative discount.,btohqsg
i just find it interesting parents would choose chromebooks over iPads tho.,btohqsg
btw@kohsyanwere you the one working in NTU or NUS?,btohqsg
If I plan to go to NTU for a visit tour  can just directly walk in? 😂,btohqsg
and hop onto the Shuttle Buses if any exists?,btohqsg
don't add to the shuttle bus crowdedness,btohqsg
no one cares as long as you’re not the kind to take pics inside the classrooms when ppl having class lol,btohqsg
179 from Boon Lay  very good tour,btohqsg
I'm sorry but as an NTU student I will advocate for potential tourists and any non students to take public bus,btohqsg
ahh don't think would sneak inside those Lecture Halls tho just walk around see the Hive structure.,btohqsg
we are paying school fees for the bus service  let us take the bus peacefully without outsiders cramming on,btohqsg
yea that’s fine. i mean technically Hive now has a “no external visitors allowed” sign but realistically just walking around is no issue,btohqsg
perfectly fine w ppl visiting just don't use our already stretched resources,btohqsg
the rule of thumb is just don’t be a nuisance  don’t be a dick,btohqsg
and don't take pictures of students like you're at a zoo LOL,btohqsg
cb my lesson in hive ppl outside take picture of the ongoing class,btohqsg
just observing  not going to attract myself attention like visiting a zoo only lol,btohqsg
rly machiam animal in a zoo vibes,btohqsg

isn't it cheaper to stay in Campus than outside?,btohqsg

idk but the taste just isnt it,btohqsg
it's so strong to the point i just feel like i'm getting a mouthful of salt,btohqsg
the flavours are too strong to be honest,btohqsg
i would prefer something with more flavour instead of savoury,btohqsg
YES Thank you.. finally someone who shares the sentiment🥲,btohqsg
like  i can deal with saltiness but wingstop is on a different level which i can never eat on a frequent basis,btohqsg
i know right.. i tried so hard to get into it because everybody made it seem like the holy grail of chicken,btohqsg
wah but i tried like 12 times and just couldnt,btohqsg
not sure what you think of 4 fingers chicken. I think too sweet,btohqsg
I tried it long ago very saucy,btohqsg
I think i had the dry rubs one for wingstop? Was ok ig,btohqsg
sorry but i would rather eat this spiciest meal in SG ( Chongqing Mala ) over Wingstop,btohqsg

it closed in 2013 or 2014 i think,btohqsg
