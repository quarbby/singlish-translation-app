i delete cuz i feel ashamed,btohqsg
i dont even know what ib is,btohqsg
IB (international baccalaureate) studies differ a lot from the normal education scheme so you can really use that as reference but no need to feel ashamed ahaha,btohqsg
when i went to tuition  my works was completely different from other students,btohqsg
so i started to lose hope abt the school and probably burden my mom,btohqsg
ah this is actually very normal to encounter during studying with the help of tuition,btohqsg
and don't lose all hope because it's definitely not a lost case,btohqsg
i used to think that the study methods i used to use in my previous batch (2006)  before i retained a year (2007 batch now) due to personal reasons  was feasible to use in exams so it was harder to adjust,btohqsg
especially since 2006 was the last of the old school type syllabus and 2007 was the newer implementation of the answer & marking scheme for most subjects,btohqsg

I feared going to school. Until now  I‚Äôm not sure what motivated them to pick on me.In Secondary 1 and 2  Ms Laurene Chung endured verbal bullying in school that followed her home  in the form of hateful anonymous comments on social media.Teenage bullying is a growing concern in Singapore  observers say  especially with new tools of social media and texting that have opened up ways for bullies to hurt people.https://str.sg/Gywi,btohqsg

The Allianz-Income deal in its current form has been called off as it‚Äôs not in the public interest  said minister Edwin Tong in Parliament.This comes 3 months after the German insurer made an offer to buy a controlling stake of at least 51% in Income.https://str.sg/3aYcB,btohqsg
Such sad news for the German insurer -- it was such a good deal for them,btohqsg
You may feel uncomfortable saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to people  but here‚Äôs how to set boundaries and not feel guilty about it:https://cna.asia/3YlFe25,btohqsg

hi anyone english good enough to help me look thru my english work to see where i can improve,btohqsg
but later she become ai sounding,btohqsg
where to improve mah  means got human intervention,btohqsg
if u r taking o lvl or a lvl  can ask ur eng teacher to mark ur essays and give feedback,btohqsg
Whole point for trying to take stake. But W gov for blocking them.For profit will lead to disaster,btohqsg
Has anyone known any person who retaked their O levels in NS? What happens after 1 year of NS and they go to poly? Or they continue NS and then after the 2 years then they go poly?,btohqsg
Next year i turn 18 and i plan to retake my O levels for only my chinese subject. Im not sure what will happen if next year i get good grades and whether i get deferment in the middle of Ns or not.,btohqsg
cause they told me i have to go NS next year the moment i turn 18,btohqsg
so like if i already go there for 1 year  then i take my O's  then do i return to finish NS or completely postpone it is my question,btohqsg
Closest I have heard is A levels. Have heard of cases of those retaking A levels during NS. None of them were my friends though  but there were of course stories about them online.,btohqsg
If I am not wrong  technically in NS  you are allowed to take leave to take an examination if you talk to your supervisor about it beforehand,btohqsg
But I think for this case  most common case I have seen is they complete NS and then do poly. I dont think is possible to go to poly after serving 1 yr of NS and then come back to NS again,btohqsg
