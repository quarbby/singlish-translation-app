No wonder you get along so well with rand,btohqsg
Nope  I waited for my dad to come back,btohqsg
hahahaha so how did it work,btohqsg
You mean given that the syllabus have changed will your old syllabus be available? I tot it is only changing in 2025 tho,btohqsg
I dunno about the price  but u can go anywhere ah UHC  any GP blah blah,btohqsg
It was coz my maid ask me to help drive in (after she finish washing car)  and then I canâ€™t find a way to get it out of park lmaoâ€¦and I canâ€™t ask my dad coz I will get scolded coz in the first place my parents only allow me drive the other car (Mazda MPV),btohqsg
Yea I meant I thought the syllabuses changes in math and GP will only take effect in 2025 batch  meaning the 2024 A levels will still be the same?,btohqsg
2024 a lvl still same. So 2025 I cannot take 2023 syllabus ah,btohqsg
Oh you meant you prefer retaking in 2025?,btohqsg
I dun think the older syllabus will be available  but best to check with your teachers?,btohqsg
at least it gave us yt voice reveal,btohqsg
Reddit has a lot of a*******,btohqsg
I saw someone complaining about a 88.75rp before,btohqsg
Saying â€˜my friends think i am capable of getting an A for GP  make me feel sadâ€™,btohqsg
Tbh i feel like that was justified,btohqsg
Have you guys heard of silver medalist phenomenon,btohqsg
Yea that's what the person feels,btohqsg
But he deleted his post lol,btohqsg
Oh yea  i must say i dun openly say it but it happened to me before,btohqsg
For me i generally dont talk to other students about my marks anymore unless they're my very very close friends or like teachers,btohqsg
Like in j2  for h2 chem  i was always on this abuv 80% list that the department show  and then i internally felt like shit when my prelim  my practical pulled me down to 77.8% (but i know if i vent out people will ofc not be happy and whatever la),btohqsg
"in y2 i got 3.87 gpa and i was 1 mark away from A+ for maths and el so I vented to my ""best friend"" who got 3.93 (I chose to vent to her cause she did Better) and she ended up shittalking meNever telling ppl my grades again",btohqsg
I felt like shit though my chem cher was happy coz i eventually still got A despite a practical D,btohqsg
I hv no friend who does better than me in jc so i hv no one to vent,btohqsg
It's a common observation that people who get silver medal at Olympics will be sad while people who get gold and bronze will be comparatively happierGold happy because they're world champion  Bronze happy because at least got something. But silver feel not so happy cause is like so so so close to being best in the world ... and they didnt achieve it,btohqsg
Actually speaking of which i think i indirectly did so lol coz i openly shared w my teacher my unhappiness / i am not satisfied when my friends beside me  i said sth indirectly tho  i was like â€˜but it is lower than 80/ lower than my previous marksâ€™,btohqsg
Unfortunately these subjective things do be like that,btohqsg
I dun think it is easy for conduct grades to drop,btohqsg
Yea there are ppl who do like shit just dun wish to see posts like this,btohqsg
Meanwhile my classmates hv easy access to my marks  cher passes mark sheets around,btohqsg
And actually think about it  how many people scored below 88.75ðŸ‘€ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Lol imagine that at sap schs,btohqsg
fking hunger games but not rlly vibes,btohqsg
Ofc will feel tilted by reading it,btohqsg
I dun think will be a case for everyone to get good grades coz of bell curve / grade boundaries,btohqsg
But i will just treat it as reddit is a platform to say anything the person wish to,btohqsg
Definitely prolly their way of making portfolio more important i guess,btohqsg
Coz now w/o pw n h1  there will be more 70 pointers and more ppl close to that ngl,btohqsg
Thrs a kid taking 3 seats on the mrt traun,btohqsg

Yes  if there is a new syllabus that would be examined the year after you take your A Levels. Subjects like GP would change syllabus this year so it would be your last chance to take the old syllabus this year.,btohqsg
