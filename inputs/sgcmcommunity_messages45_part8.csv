Actuallt becoz it was becoz of pollution control. More engine CC = more chance to pollute more = hence pay more tax. That’s the boomer assumption,btohqsg
Then I think after that they adjusted that structure to include power output as manufacturers reduce engine cc to meet tightening emissions regulations and introduced compression to increase the output at the same time?,btohqsg
EVs by default will have better output alr,btohqsg
Cause they want to tax lost of petrol income,btohqsg
Well 700 extra leh starting next year,btohqsg
I hope you don’t feel the pain,btohqsg
Almost 6k for your car alr,btohqsg
To me the 700 should throw to petrol car,btohqsg
But maybe they need protect the dealer now,btohqsg
It should be more pollution pay more logic,btohqsg
"yup.ridiculous nonsense by the government. want to ""encourage"" EV but charge u more for using EVA lump-sum tax will be built into the road tax schedule for electric vehicles (EV) to partly account for the loss in fuel excise duties since owners of such cars do not pay them  Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat said in his Budget speech on Tuesday.https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/singapore-budget-2020/budget-2020-lump-sum-tax-built-into-road-tax-for-electric",btohqsg
Later all dealer close shop   job lost more problems,btohqsg
If they start to wack ice car with more road tax,btohqsg
Many ppl can’t afford and will not buy car,btohqsg
Dealer and workshop a lot can close shop,btohqsg
Byd and tesla just come to sg less then a year and dealer can already feel the pinch of sales and revenue dropping,btohqsg
It will just get worst and they need time to transit   if not really close shop and it is not good,btohqsg
10 years I think more than enough time alr,btohqsg
Yes but now u can see they are struggling   show room big big   lots of staff   sales keep dropping how to sustain,btohqsg
The other alleged controversy on why SG is slow to adopt EV is due to our oil refinery industry 🙃,btohqsg
Why keep finding people to whack one… it’s an equitable thing one mah. Individuals should pay for what one wants? If it’s really the environmental angle  then should buy the lower power output ones coz use less (then needs less generation) then can enjoy the lower road tax also?,btohqsg
I think is more to try to protect the motor association ba   they need time la haha,btohqsg
Now ev model too little and not enough as supply,btohqsg
EVs tax should be at the AC/DC charger😂The more frequent you charge  the more pollution at the power stations😂👍Petrol tax $0.69/litreCarbon tax $0.69/5-10KW😂,btohqsg
