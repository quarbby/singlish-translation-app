Revolut can spend in MYR? I know it doesn't allow you to exchange it as well as CNY,btohqsg
I'm going Malaysia and thinking of toping up credit to Revolut then use the Revolut card for my spending there.,btohqsg
Can't top up ringgit. Only wise can,btohqsg
Any other app for replacement beside grabpay to use in hawkers thanks,btohqsg
Xnap app  can find in Google or apple App Store.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I am collecting my keys for my HDB BTO soon and would like to know what would you do if you are in my shoes.I have about 45k in my SA and 100k in my OA (rough figures)Would you..A) transfer the 100k to SA before HDB wipes it clean so that the SA becomes 145k and you are able to hit FRS sooner with VCMA and RSTU or..B) pay HDB with the 100k and take lesser loan from HDB and then do VCMA and RSTU till you hit FRS.I am thinking option A makes more sense but I'm afraid I am wrong. Please help üôèüèº,btohqsg
how much cash in hand you have? If you have enough  I would suggest you can cash up rather then taking higher loan.,btohqsg
So would you do A or B assuming you have enough on hand like say.. $100k spare cash,btohqsg
how much loan you are getting from HDB? use cash is better to offset and take lower loan  if not you can take max loan (you can repay early though). If OA wipe away  and after you replay loan you want move house  you still need to pay OA interest.,btohqsg
So what would you do? A or B (transfer OA to SA before HDB wipe or dont do anything and pay off the HDB to loan lesser),btohqsg
I would choose A in your case - got spare cash,btohqsg
Hdb loan is worth it to take since it's cheap interest,btohqsg
Take as much as u can,btohqsg
Thanks for your answer! Appreciate it,btohqsg
See your priority. If you intend to shift house frequent  better not take too much loan,btohqsg
I think need to consider SA is good to top up for tax reduction,btohqsg
Okay so I assume you are also going for option A right? So build your SA instead and just take more loan at the 2.6% loan interest,btohqsg
Topping up SA has saved me much tax all these while.,btohqsg
Ya but doing option A you can still do RSTU and top up since have yet to hit FRS right?,btohqsg
But u hv years ahead as well,btohqsg
One year 8k very fast max de. By the time u paying 15% tax bracket it's a lot of tax saving,btohqsg
Because right now I only have 45k SA and im 32. So i only have another 23 years to go. Not sure if i top up 8k yearly plus my employer contribution monthly now i can hit FRS or not by 55 years old ü§î,btohqsg
Okay so you would not transfer the 100k from your OA to SA before key collection. Use the 100k in OA to pay off the HDB so no need take a big loan and then do topping up to your SA yearly. Am I right to say that?,btohqsg
I mean I am sure theres no right or wrong answer. Thats why I just want your opinions to help me given the scenario.,btohqsg
So now A vs B is 1 : 1 ü§£ Need more opinions Thanks@WarriorDan.KaijuKingz and@Derrick,btohqsg
Nope  I will use OA money to buy fixed deposit with higher returns  then loan max from HDB.,btohqsg
FD 3.8%  hdb loan around 2.6%  still can earn a bit. But really no right or wrong answer,btohqsg
Okay so that is somewhat like Option A because you are like shielding your OA right? So option A 2 option B 0,btohqsg
What is your monthly mortgage? I would Multiply by 12 and keep that in oa  the rest i will transfer,btohqsg
2.6% is god-tier in this current market,btohqsg
Yeah I saw your video on that üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºOkay assuming I have enough spare cash to cover the 12months monthly mortgage.Should I do Option A and transfer the rest all to SA?,btohqsg
Yea but that gives u a shorter runway for income tax reduction,btohqsg
No right or wrong tho  u just have to figure out what makes sense for you,btohqsg
Even if u let HDB wipe out your CPF  what‚Äôs the worst  you accrue interest but it‚Äôs your money anyway,btohqsg
If you transfer out to SA you‚Äôre trading potential income tax reduction for higher interest rates,btohqsg
Because correct me if I am not wrong. Many people who does not care much or have not much knowledge on retirement and wanting to hit FRS will go for option B. So i am on now at this crossroad and hope you guys can enlighten me and share which path is the best for me,btohqsg
I mean I am leaning towards Option A but just hope more ppl agree with it ü§£,btohqsg
Because once i do the transfer its irreversible,btohqsg
At this moment can put OA into FD/T-bills to prevent HDB from wiping out your OA.,btohqsg
Yes  this is what I do. But i understand why a lot of people don't do that,btohqsg
Does ocbc offer new credit card sign up promotions?,btohqsg
My POV is if i transfer these 100k to my SA making it become 145k  and i continue to do RSTU plus continue working and get my employer contribution. The 145k will grow at 4% compound so I can hit FRS faster.But if i choose option B  my concern is my 45k would take longer to hit FRS even though yes I might be able to pay off my house faster and then focus on hitting FRS eventually.,btohqsg
