Another brand of tea that is not bad - The 1872 Clipper Tea Co. i love their peppermint tea. So good,btohqsg
But their prices are steep. ‰π∞‰∏ç‰∏ãÊâã,btohqsg
I think i got it as a Christmas exchange gift,btohqsg
"This is basically the PG version of the saying ""anything can be a dildo if you are brave enough.""",btohqsg
Yes just like just now i was playing black jack  i called the number in my mind and it came! Haha,btohqsg
Tily tea also not bad. My boss bought as xmas gift. Buying this for my gf bday..,btohqsg
This one very nice. Random buy yday at singpost ctr üòÇ,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs bonding with our relatives. So fun and lots of laughter,btohqsg
I wonder is it opposite tokyo premium outlet?,btohqsg
Ohhhh i knw where le.. near my hotel ü§£,btohqsg
Cos when i was at premium outlet  i saw opposite is that ski area,btohqsg
WAHHHHH THIS... makes me think back on playing Blackjack in the casino here.,btohqsg
I didnt try the ski thou.. bz checking in to the hotel,btohqsg
I stayed here long time ago.. just 1 night stay.,btohqsg
The hotel which provide the yukata ü§£,btohqsg
My gfs! 5 of us went tokyo,btohqsg
Ya. BlackJack or Baccarat last player.. Usually very stressed one.. Cos ppl behind or other players will scold u if u dunno how to open the cards üòÇü§£üòÇ,btohqsg
If there's one thing I realised about myself now  it is that I HATE spectators watching or people commenting a lot when I am gambling at anything.,btohqsg
Talk and grumble and grouse and try to backseat gamble.,btohqsg
End up talk all my luck away.,btohqsg
Think most of us are not comfortable with someone behind us watching,btohqsg
"I ever walked off before from a roulette table because there was this guy who was not even playing constantly standing around us and going ""EH EH EH PUT THIS NUMBER I FEEL IT COMING ALREADY.""",btohqsg
Even if they don‚Äôt talk  i also don‚Äôt like it when there are people behind me,btohqsg
I feel like if they quietly watch without commenting  I'm fine.,btohqsg
It's those who can't seem to shut up.,btohqsg
I win money I quietly win.,btohqsg
I lose money I quietly lose.,btohqsg
Some waiting for the chance ride on ur luck mah. U will see some will come over and stack their chips on top of u when u are on the roll. And they usually hit the table limit one,btohqsg
Abit crowded the last time I went and almost bumped into a kid who suddenly got in my way and he cried lol but I never bump into him,btohqsg
I ever had someone ride my luck before on roulette  but I was fine with it because he was a classy player.,btohqsg
The view is nice but just don‚Äôt look down HAHAHA,btohqsg
That why i only play with my family members. At least we are familiar with each other.,btohqsg
Did that and my mind was playing last destination üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Unfortunately within my immediate family gambling is banned apart from buying 4D on special occasions. And we haven't visited our extended family in ages in Malaysia so no mass gambling session.,btohqsg
For someone who's a heathen sinner like me  my immediate family background is very much like being from a temple.,btohqsg
I think the kind of losses at Blackjack that will really tilt me is if I get 20 and stand  and then dealer get immediate Blackjack just by opening his other card without even drawing.,btohqsg
My dad side all can gamble. We all risk takers,btohqsg
You answered the wrong person lol.,btohqsg
On hindsight  I do like the view when looking down tho,btohqsg
Ya didn‚Äôt notice until I sent it HAHAU,btohqsg
Is ok  sometimes I fat fingers also.,btohqsg
Haha look down at cards‚Ä¶technically not wrong too.,btohqsg
Try playing it with Jeremy tan (tiktok) you‚Äôll regret it lol especially if you make him the dealerü§£üòÇ,btohqsg
I saw his videos. See alr stun.,btohqsg
No Tiktok  he's also on Insta.,btohqsg
Any kind soul at Bedok interchange?? Nearby UOB bank ? As I left my wallet there ?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt want play with him sure lose before game start,btohqsg
I will only play against him if he promise me that he will use the money he won from me to treat us both to food.,btohqsg
But one thing I can say for sure.,btohqsg
Can go any casino just don't go Genting one.,btohqsg
