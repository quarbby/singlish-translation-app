Yah that‚Äôs one thing I abit headache with my car now as you know@Gerardo85hhaha I‚Äôm not sure I need to get the fd2 or the type R one,btohqsg
Ahhh I see I see my friends told me it‚Äôs high,btohqsg
For most things should be the same if not related to the engine,btohqsg
That's why must come here talk talk then ppl start to appear,btohqsg
Boring always I talk to you  you talk to me,btohqsg
Yah but mine is related so I‚Äôm not sure on what to order hahaha,btohqsg
So far I never had to order anything engine related,btohqsg
And maintain a cl7r is easy. Mix and match with many cars like fd2r  ep3  dc5  etc,btohqsg
Ahhh I see but it‚Äôs really nice car. One silver Brz yesterday poke me and challenge me HAHA but I didn‚Äôt really play with him. His was quite fast,btohqsg
More like clutch  flywheel  throttle body,btohqsg
Actually I feel one thing good about Honda is that some of the parts can share with different cars,btohqsg
Yah he really fly I just follow him at the back,btohqsg
My old exhaust now lives inDnaaaZeaaaaaacar,btohqsg
Js racing exhaust and their header tgt,btohqsg
Some more the repair is go through LTA,btohqsg
I see Malaysia mostly using Js racing,btohqsg
It was badly cracked when I got it,btohqsg
Everytime I repair it keep cracking,btohqsg
So I got fed up and ordered hks,btohqsg
Because the time I was using it  borders still closed,btohqsg
Singapore got no proper shop to repair titanium,btohqsg
Ohhh no wonder. Yah now border open a lot of things able to do at a cheaper rate and better workmanship. But engine all these I still do in sg,btohqsg
The shop he go  repair got 1 year never cracked again,btohqsg
The shop in Singapore  within mins it will crack,btohqsg
Haha surprisingly most ppl dk that the toyobaru are pretty quick. Managed to keep a few sg/msian fd2r humble. And my car was stock lol,btohqsg
Parts and repairs wise tbh they are pretty comparable for honda vs toyobaru. That said hondas are older so more wear items are to be expected. The 86/brz got quite alot that are relatively low mileage,btohqsg
Doesnt mean low mileage means no issue. But in the end it‚Äôs personal preferences.,btohqsg
Correct bro  can't go wrong either way. Owned honda and the toyobarus each got plus and minus,btohqsg
Grass is always greener on the other side somehow lol,btohqsg
But end of day whats bring u joy,btohqsg
Oh yes. I averaged 11-12km/l easily,btohqsg
Yeah if you keep to the right RPM on the highway when you can hit the peak timing advance. Quite easy to hit. Tho timely maintenance  good oil and cleaning the MAF sensor helps,btohqsg
Wow 11/12 Warh mine haha no eye see,btohqsg
