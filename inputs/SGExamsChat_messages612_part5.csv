Imma one time flex to all the phy gods if I end up in phy Olympiad,btohqsg

I like chem but somehow I do btr for phy,btohqsg

Trust me  when I was writing notes for my students  I realised how much I sucked in Physics during A levels,btohqsg
it shows that physics conceptual knowledge  while important  isn't the main component to scoring,btohqsg
me suffering through writing essays after essays now,btohqsg
the amount i didnâ€™t actually understand from young and freedman when i read it in y1,btohqsg
vs reading it for olympiad in jc,btohqsg
I kinda partially even more motivated to ace physics,btohqsg
got a few gens of physics lovers alr,btohqsg
why everywhere i go everyonems doing sci,btohqsg
Doing physics sometimes make me feel like my own logic ain't logicing,btohqsg
how was uni sem 1 btw,btohqsg
Like I thought I was logically logical until I found out I wasnt,btohqsg
the more physics you learn  sometimes it becomes very counterintuitive,btohqsg
piled with sci mods next sem,btohqsg
they asked  then I think ok lor  try try jc version,btohqsg
but really tough. I decided not to focus on jc olympiad,btohqsg
oh yeah iâ€™m kinda technically allowed to take on some non ntu jobs now,btohqsg

Funny my friend not even good in phy but cause he got selected for sec sch one he ended up getting selected for jc one,btohqsg
JC version needs to be very good in maths,btohqsg
Ngl I kinda happy Im able to help abit of the As pcme stuff in the other chat,btohqsg
it's the maths part that's hard to teach because I thought the students would know but they don't,btohqsg
tbh smth iâ€™ve been wanting to explore as a long term project is taking a leaf from minutephysics on youtube or 3blue1brown,btohqsg
Idg what's with the comp sci hype tho,btohqsg
jc one is like even if you know the physics you canâ€™t translate it to steps,btohqsg
I need someone to push me on this also. Just procrastinating ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
I thought engineering is the one,btohqsg
i too donâ€™t wanna get bitches,btohqsg
