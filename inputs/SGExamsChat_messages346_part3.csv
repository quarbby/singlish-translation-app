Hi guys i need some form of inspiration to brainstorm  what are some aspects of limitations in the healthcare / medical sector that yall can think of ( aside from cost and manpower ),btohqsg
when hospitals got overun and respirators had to be chosen for specific patients essentially becoming a death sentence for those with no respirator,btohqsg
"Clinical trials and testing typically take a long time to complete. Delays ability to treat patients. Quite amazing that Covid vaccines were rolled out as quickly as they did.Treatments and medication tends to favor the average person. There are people with unique conditions that typical treatments can't address  and it's ""not worth it"" to develop treatments for them.On a more social front  some important roles like nurses are not that appealing to locals  so many filled up by foreigners. May not be a sustainable practice  and doesn't help if patients are xenophobic.But I'm not in the sector la so don't have to take these as fact",btohqsg
:0 okay thanks   ill try to think of smth,btohqsg
is it possible to talk about how the healthcare system exacerbates social inequality  as poor people spend a larger proportion of their income on healthcare than the rich? but can rebut by using SGs example of CHAS or sth idk,btohqsg
That one wld be hard to solve sia,btohqsg
Covid vaccines are actually under emergency use  they didn't exactly go through the same route as typical drugs.,btohqsg
But it is true that usually pharma aim to release blockbuster drugs that target big illnesses like cancer and such coz it sells better. Rare genetic conditions  especially those only seen more often in 3rd world countries usually not a popular topic.,btohqsg
