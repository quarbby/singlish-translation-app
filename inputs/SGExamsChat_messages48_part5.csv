It’ll take a while more to see the effects of the c b,btohqsg
But if it extends no surprise,btohqsg
Not much you can do about that sadly,btohqsg
But it'll get harder for them to go out without a mask anyway,btohqsg
Other than these places I guess there are still parks,btohqsg
But if you're going to exercise wearing masks doesn't make sense anyway,btohqsg
The cotton masks are already hard to breathe in LOL,btohqsg
Would it be attributed as a covid death then,btohqsg
Leadership and job shadowing more impt,btohqsg
H3 is just a fluff bonus point,btohqsg
What H3 can you take that will be relevant to medicine,btohqsg
Yeah that's what I thought too,btohqsg
Compare that H3 you have in mind to a job shadowing/internship at a hospital,btohqsg
If you were the interviewer  which one would you prefer,btohqsg
ofc if you have both then good la,btohqsg
But I think it's pretty clear that medicine related experiences > volunteering > others,btohqsg
I didn't even take chem in JC LOL,btohqsg
If you J1 I'd suggest you focus on other stuff,btohqsg
I think CCA leadership achievements will be useful as well and activities outside school which highlight positive qualities (resilience  heart of service  etc.),btohqsg
have a decent cca portfolio  can le. Job attachments is important but if you don't have it  is fine also tbh,btohqsg
how are the interviews like? there r a few rounds rite,btohqsg
tbh the first/second choice bonus points thingy doesn't help much,btohqsg
Haha yeah don't listen to me too much I can't give advice,btohqsg
like u put medicine first choice u get bonus 2.5 pts,btohqsg
that one doesnt rly help much one,btohqsg
cos if everyone score roughly the same raw UAS range and put med first choice  at the end of the day they will still look at the raw score,btohqsg
The bonus points aren’t available for interview courses anyway,btohqsg
but even so  comp sci is a good example of how it doesn't help,btohqsg
depends on the schntu has one interview consisting of 8 stationsnus has two interviews consisting of a written test (sjt) and a group task (fsa)of course for this year the interviews are modified  prob will not be for next yr onwards,btohqsg
my seniors said it was ?,btohqsg
although i cant comment more abt it  but ya it isn't a group task/interview  even though theres a certain part that is grp interview,btohqsg
the remaining portions are individual stations,btohqsg
Genuine qn  but if there's anyone here who has went to tuition for chem at a tuition centre for A levels chem  can pm me? Thx wanna ask something.,btohqsg
Guys anyone going np ba this year?,btohqsg
I mean...If you have a sugar daddy or someone who what to share with you yes but if not no lah haha,btohqsg
Maybe if you're 21 and you're also a teen,btohqsg
That sweet $600 is in  bois,btohqsg
The only limit is your imagination,btohqsg
tfw when you born in sg and 21 but don’t qualify for $600,btohqsg
born in sg but seems like malaysia declared sovereignty over sg for a couple of seconds when i was born so i became malaysian,btohqsg
Oh I think I know how  if you’re born on leap day :),btohqsg
gotta wait till 28th april though,btohqsg
get them to share with you the 300,btohqsg
i didn't declare bank account i think,btohqsg
I thought they had it alr since they gave us the NS pay through the bank acc,btohqsg
then turns out need to fill in form,btohqsg
Being young is costing us money,btohqsg
so he turns 21 later this yr,btohqsg
Less frequent mrt = more commuters per given time waiting and congregating for train,btohqsg
As mentioned by an NCID doctor,btohqsg
