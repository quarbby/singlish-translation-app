Make sense  but for second year renewal  unless Choco finance decide to allow axs payment again.,btohqsg
Hey everyone sorry to disturb. Is Chocolate finance all right now? Did they resume withdrawals  or is more bad news comingv,btohqsg
Morning.. may I know any recommendations for cheap 5G sim only plan?,btohqsg
Depending on your expectations too. I port over to simba yest at IT show and was given a $20 credit (credit later) and now for every topping up of $20  they would give $20. Eight has a promo too but I didn't read about the terms.,btohqsg
These are 4G plans right? I dun see any 5G plans for eight.  I'm looking for those that uses singtel network,btohqsg
Simba is 5g but not good kind of 5g. Singtel has gomo w 5g i think.,btohqsg
Zym mobile is also under singtel and has 5g plan,btohqsg
Anyone knows what's SIMBA MCC code ah? üòÅ,btohqsg
I have both so far seems like zym better in jb,btohqsg

depends the mcc fall under which category,btohqsg
using fairprice app at kopitiam is mcc 5814 under dining,btohqsg
do you know if TADA is considered travel for maybank f&f,btohqsg
Let's get some basic on which mcc are for which Maybank FnF categories.,btohqsg
What about UOB preferred platinum? Will this be considered contactless?,btohqsg
don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs contactless but it falls under the bonus online categories for PPV. So 4mpd still.,btohqsg
Ntuc is grocery category   Shopee supermarket is online category. But if you buy from redmart lazada  it is grocery too,btohqsg
For those salary that above $6k or $7k(exceed max)  the tax relief amount shown on your NOA is $20400 or $37740?,btohqsg

Hi experts  can I still get maxmiles if I pay hospital bill  taxes  mrt  utilities  insurance and school fees with chocolate finance card ?,btohqsg
correct .. the spend adds another 0.65% ..,btohqsg
from my experience too .. I pay $10.10 mthly for 5G ..,btohqsg
i would say about the same quality,btohqsg
i choose zym cause it's much better value for a service which i barely notice any difference,btohqsg
zym is so value with all the port in bonus,btohqsg
20400  the rest is from your employer,btohqsg
5G for 1st 3 months only or forever?,btohqsg
Does the chocolate debit card allow for payment for income tax? And if so what benefits are there?,btohqsg
Many have asked about how to pay income tax and earn rewards after AXS option doesn't work with CF. I will try to post a guide for CardUp this week (not sponsored),btohqsg
Agreed... Zym only includes roaming for Asiapac but not outside Asiapac..,btohqsg
if possible  can show how to do the monthly setup? so the giro setup on bank side and how to do the setup on cardup side as well,btohqsg
This means it is impossible to hit $37740 using employment CPF contributions alone without voluntary top up ?,btohqsg
