You pay for the driving pleasure and the engine,btohqsg
Next time you put this in your Lambo ok?,btohqsg
I want all. Whether I on the music or hud is up to me. But the options must be there. If not ppl will ask me why Lambo music n hud also don’t hv,btohqsg
When They buy  they never choose the hud option,btohqsg
Good for you! You send us pictures when you buy Lambo with HUD next time. We clap for you!,btohqsg
It’s common sense. U pay millions for a car without basic stuffs like music n hud?,btohqsg
Yes  because you sit in the car you don't want music. Listen to the sweet V10 sound is good enough,btohqsg
Plus it does come with a music system,btohqsg
I want both. Whether I on the music or hud is up to me,btohqsg
Just now I take grab Mazda 3 new 1,btohqsg

Can organise a car party to Thailand ?,btohqsg
Anybody looking for iqos or heets pm cod 👍,btohqsg
Non HUD car can join also? 🤣🤣,btohqsg
I drove the Niro about 300km on my holiday this week. Good acceleration and features and I can see the draw as a mass market family point A to point B ride. Quiet cabin and comfortable.  However if I were to compare it with performance ICE cars  it definitely lacks the engagement  sharpness and drive experience ICE performance cars bring. Not an apple to apple comparison here I know 😅😅 and it has no HUD 😕,btohqsg
Sir I can see it for the Urus but not really on the other models. The sitting position is already so low and dash is literally sitting higher than on most road cars such that you don’t really need to look down per se?,btohqsg
Ok probably I’m a short dude too that’s why 😅,btohqsg
On hifi  Lambo have sound system and with all due respect to other car makes  it has become a marketing point by car makers to help sell their cars nowadays. However on Lambo I don’t think they need to boast having an xyz hifi brand on board to help sell their cars. At least not for me.,btohqsg
Besides  to enjoy hifi quality  one needs a certain quietness to the cabin and that is not quite what one gets in a Lambo. Or carpet ride quality.,btohqsg
It is never one for me anyway. Have sound can already. Our journeys are so short in Singapore too. Hifi are best enjoyed in the comfort of home! 😄😄,btohqsg
It’s a basic thing all new cars have now. Whether ppl use them or not it’s up to them. But the options must be there,btohqsg
