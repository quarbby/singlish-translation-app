U need to call cso to nominate a miles card to link your krisflyer membership number to before u can redeem  unless u have a uob krisflyer which is already link,btohqsg
Hey  SSB can be redeemed any month with both prorated interest and original principle sum (regardless of interest rate environment as it is backed by sg govt). So you can treat it like 10 year FD with flexible redemption clause.Should you want to move your money to invest elsewhere you can always redeem SSB and plop into something else,btohqsg
You can be a director instead of an employee. Director fees are optional,btohqsg
Oh I c. Thanks for your reply,btohqsg
I am a director  so if I don‚Äôt pay director fees to myself  does that mean that my personal income is $0 and I do not have to file for my personal taxation this March?,btohqsg
Then it‚Äôs nil income for the year,btohqsg

Hi all  what kind of voucher to buy if I want to hit min spend for my credit card by end of the month? (Ocbc frank),btohqsg
Hello folks. Just watched Chris‚Äô new video on buying of Tbills using his CPF OA. Reminded me of a burning question that I always wanted to know the answer to. Not too sure if this was ever discussed.I noticed every new 6-months Tbill issue date falls on the exact same date as a maturity date of a 6months ago issued Tbill.  Not too sure why is this the case.I have one Tbill that‚Äôs going to mature on 6 Feb and the one that‚Äôs open for auction now has an issue date of 6 Feb.Does that mean that I will not be able to continuously rollover my matured OA Tbills and I‚Äôll have to wait for the next auction at the end of Feb?,btohqsg
UserNichas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:not the right chat,btohqsg
Yes  I know that I need to pay the corporate taxes. Just a little confuse on the personal tax part.,btohqsg
Ocbc based on posting date not transaction date so if u are refering to jan might be a bit risky.U can look a your lifestyle and see what voucher suit you the best. No other can answer that for you tbh.,btohqsg
Good morning guys  if I‚Äôm applying for personal loan what are the things to look for? What‚Äôs the difference between advertised Interest rate vs effective interest rate?,btohqsg
Always ask the officer or look out for the words Effective Interest Rate or EIR.They cannot cheat u on this. It is mas mandated official comparable term.,btohqsg
Some will try to sneak around smoking u the answer,btohqsg
Yeah if u clearly ask effective interest rate on recorded phone. They won‚Äôt/cant lie.,btohqsg
So the first thing is to lookout for EIR right? Then what is applied interest rate? I read articles about it but I can‚Äôt able to understand it. I need a sample eg to understand the terms better.,btohqsg
My 1 year T bill that i bought last year should mature today - any idea what time the money will be transferred back to my account? I used CPF OA,btohqsg
Regarding OCBC 360  I understand that Feb is a good time to reset it to $100k in Feb. So when exactly should I withdraw the excess funds?,btohqsg

for the moomoo cash funds promo i just reach 1 month and they gave me a 5.8% pa guaranteed return cash coupon  am i supposed to use the coupon right now? i just hit month 1 out of 2 months,btohqsg

heyo guys‚Ä¶ anyone know if there are methods to use credit card for Paynow to a mobile number?,btohqsg

No such method as of now,btohqsg
Advertised interest rate is whatever magical math the bank quotes to rope you in. EIR is what you actually have to pay  always check the fine print before confirming or signing,btohqsg
Ala 7.8% Uob one is bull,btohqsg
They are not lying about the interest rate. They only point to that one perk and mask out the rest in the headline. So it is up to us to sift the ‚Äúnoises‚Äù no one is responsible for our financial well being expect we ourselves,btohqsg
Does money market fund give dividends or is just like share price (buy low sell high)?,btohqsg
If got charge 2.5 % for using credit card payment then bohua Liao,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a low risk investment and the money you put inside will be invested in MAS bills and bonds. Depending on which fund you choose you‚Äôll get daily interest.,btohqsg
Oh  I also don‚Äôt see this,btohqsg
Money market funds are accumulating funds. Think of it that their dividends are invested back to itself  so no dividends are issued. But the fund price just keeps going up (almost always).,btohqsg
Thanks all for the input  so  the interest is putting back to the fund automatically. We only have capital gain when I sell my fund ( if price go down I lost) correct?,btohqsg
Hi all - this has been asked before but doesnt seem to have a clear ans yet- Since oct dbs multiplier acc has allowed non giro paynow sal for bonus int - anyone tried the sal hack similar to uob - did it work for dbs multiplier too?

Is there credit card that got rebates to pay for car insurance?,btohqsg
Is it possible to pay Trust Bank credit card bill by any other credit card or by giro?,btohqsg
to pay for insurance is no. But u can go through 3rd party like Cardup to pay for it and earn the rebates whether it is cashback or miles,btohqsg
no... the only way is to transfer money into ur trust bank account and pay via there,btohqsg

Thanks.Not even like using POSB everyday card to earn cashback?For a onetime car insurance payment?,btohqsg
Do you need to enable this,btohqsg
not sure abt that but u hv to read the t&c for it,btohqsg
Credit card normally will exclude insurance  hospital and government bills etc for rewards and cashback. Exception will be Standard Chartered prudential card where it specifically stated in t&c,btohqsg
Based on tnc  theoretically can work. But no one bothered to try because the interest is trash.,btohqsg
What you can do is open a DBS MyAccount (no fall below fee) then link that to DBS PayLah. Link your GPay to DBS PayLah. Transfer your funds to DBS MyAccount then use GPay to pay PayNow QR.,btohqsg

Hi  question on CPF.1. Can we still transfer OA to SA if SA already hit FRS? (below 55).2. Can we withdraw the transfer amount after 55 yo?,btohqsg
1. No2. No  but it just means it‚Äôll form part of RA first and once BRS/FRS is reached the mandatory contributions can be withdrawn,btohqsg
To add on to Ed's point for no.2  you can look up something called CPF Shielding.You can shield your SA monies from being used to form your RA. This basically gives you the flexibility to keep your SA monies to earn 4.08% and withdraw it anytime if you have hit FRS in RA.,btohqsg

They will calculate your average balance over the month. Note that the interest is only credited at the end of the month so it doesn't help increase your average balance,btohqsg
Yup. No need to be scared after 6 months will drop below 3.5% p.a. or what,btohqsg

Are you saying that for that month just withdraw all out and put in another higher interest rate account since without the save bonus component  it will only be 2.5% from the salary component for OCBC 360?,btohqsg
Yes.It will be range from 2.6%-3.1% depends on the amount you have for both spend n salary category.If you only have salary category  it is between 2%-2.5%.,btohqsg

The answer is already in the message you sent,btohqsg
If its foreign currency  makes sense to use Amaze linked to UOB Lady‚Äôs. If it‚Äôs local currency  I don‚Äôt see the point to use Amaze  I‚Äôll just use UOB Lady‚Äôs directly.,btohqsg
Ah  I understand now. So  Amaze is specifically for overseas purchases  thanks Jasmine for sharing,btohqsg
isn‚Äôt the watch considered as mobile contactless also?,btohqsg

Any idea if i will enjoy my full tax relief if i top up to my mum if she‚Äôs reaching 55 this year?OA+SA = already exceed the year‚Äôs FRS (205.8k)But SA alone definitely not enough to hit 205.8k. If i top up to SA does it qualify for 8k tax relief for YA2025?,btohqsg
UOB PRVI miles don‚Äôt have a monthly cap on the reward miles?,btohqsg
Hello I have a question (dilemma of sorts). I know several finfluencers including heartland boy advocate for trying to reach BHS first in order to supercharge SA  if not hit FRS yet.If my mandatory employee and employer contributions via OW and AW would have already hit the CPF annual contribution limit of $37 740  Does it still make to sense for me to VCMA In order to try to hit BHS? (and get some tax relief too)Or should I just RSTU to my SA and work towards FRS directly? (and get some tax relief too),btohqsg
Best if can install antenna also,btohqsg
FRS limit only based on SA. Can top-up 8k and get tax relief before RA is formed. Reminder this monies will be reserved and will go directly to RA for CPF Life.,btohqsg

Not true  you can transfer money to other bank accounts via non-FAST and it clocks as GIRO,btohqsg
Ezlink top up not counted for bonus interest I think,btohqsg
If I pay using UOB VS with RM is it can earn x10? Afraid their payment gateway from SG,btohqsg
Just giro non fast to anyone with funds originate from uob one account or any uob account will clock as giro?,btohqsg
Can't really determine this. Cannot tell whether payment gateway is in sg or not. Depends on merchant. Esp for uob gateway need to be overseas. If not sure better use other cards.,btohqsg
i think the answer is almost always vcma first,btohqsg

Extend by 1mth only sadly haha,btohqsg
VCMA is ‚Äòsuperior‚Äô to RSTU SA because VCMA gives the same tax relief as RSTU yet your money isn‚Äôt quite as ‚Äòstuck‚Äô. There‚Äôs no way to withdraw MA in any situation other than to ‚Äòutilise‚Äô it. However  amounts above BRS/FRS can be withdrawn at 55. So the earlier you hit BHS  the faster your mandatory contribution overflows from MA to SA which is withdrawal. Contrast this if you RSTU to SA  that top up can‚Äôt be withdrawn,btohqsg
Can be credit card bills too. So you can sign up GIRO for DBS CC from UOB One account  and it counts. To be clear  that GIRO is the one where you send in paper GIRO form to DBS and it‚Äôs a recurring deduction initiated by DBS,btohqsg
Hi gurus  is topping up GrabPay considered as qualifying spend?,btohqsg
Yes.. we need to spend minimum 500 per month on the UOB card .. this can be one GIRO and other one can be other banks credit cards as well.Setting up 3 GIRO may not be a challenge unless if there is a minimum amount on each GIRO,btohqsg
Why do you want to set up giro instead of crediting salary? The interest rate are a lot different,btohqsg
Thanks for replying. Yup I understand this. It‚Äôs just that VCMA is in a way also restricted by the CPF annual contribution limit of $37 740 (which includes both mandatory and voluntary contributions)My ordinary wages (OW) or monthly salary and additional wages (AW) or bonuses would most likely already hit the limit by the end of the year  so further voluntary contributions now via VCMA is not ideal I feel  as any excess mandatory contributions will be refunded back to my employer (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong)RSTU to SA to not limited by the CPF annual contribution limitAlso  it‚Äôs not a must to hit the BHS (although I think just staying employed with mandatory MA contributions would hit the BHS eventually)  so not sure if I also need so much monies in my MA. Even though it‚Äôs currently being used to pay for my hospitalisation  integrated shield plan and careshield life  it‚Äôs just a tiny fraction every year. Not sure if I will fully utilise after retirement and in my old age (but guess this is also a blessing in disguise)On the other hand  at 55 my reserved SA monies will form bulk of my RA monies which will eventually be paid out to me in the form of CPF life payouts. So I will definitely utilise the monies,btohqsg
One consideration is many of us will hit BHS eventually. If so  then can consider hitting it earlier so that mandatory contributions flow to SA (which you will get via lump sum at 55 or via CPF life),btohqsg
Vcma is not limited by the contribution limit,btohqsg
Ya so why do you want to setup giro instead?,btohqsg
do you understand that once you hit bhs  all the contribution to ma will flow to sa? if yes and you also know that you will eventually also hit bhs via your mandatory contributions  then you will know your net amount in both accounts will be the same in say  10/20 years time.the only difference is that your sa will be fully unreserved if you topup ma. if you topup sa  that amount will be reserved,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt change my salary account due to other personal reasons,btohqsg
Yup and that is why I said ‚Äòin a way‚Äô. Can refer to this dollars and sense article:https://dollarsandsense.sg/whats-maximum-amount-can-contribute-cpf-accounts-year/,btohqsg
Make a fast payment from your bank to uob and state it as salary payment,btohqsg
uob allows you to ownself transfer ownself  still count as salary,btohqsg
its not in any way. the article is referring to voluntary topup to 3 accounts as in at once ie vc3a,btohqsg
This Reddit post seems to explain it better.https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/17re86g/cpf_clarifications/,btohqsg
Oh ok. I think I‚Äôll just call cpf to clarify this with them haha,btohqsg
this is referring to VC (specifically to OA/SA)  there's an after note for VCMA. VC cap is aligned with Mandatory contri cap because self-employed people should have the same caps as company-employed ones. but VCMA doesn't have that limit  the only limit is BHS,btohqsg
No fast payment from dbs works too,btohqsg
can confirm for this. as long as you select salary payment as category when xfering,btohqsg
This statement is true for every other banks except UOB. You don't deserve their lousy giro bonus interest rate.,btohqsg
seem like alot of people dunno about this. go spread to friends and families and milk this well deserved 5%,btohqsg
If you cannot meet salary credit requirements ($1.6k transfer into UOB One account)  then better off with a no-frills bank account that also meets 2.5% p.a.,btohqsg
Did you use the debit card?,btohqsg
What does the the tnc say?,btohqsg
Just clarified with cpf. Ok VCMA is not restricted by the cpf annual contribution limit and is only restricted by the BHS limit (the customer service person actually told me otherwise initially and then called back to clarify again and to  apologise for the mistake üòÇ Guess cpf people can get it wrong too haha),btohqsg
VCMA isNOTlimited to the annual contribution limit.,btohqsg
Ohh that‚Äôs good lead .. I will look into it :),btohqsg
Yup I do. Now it‚Äôs just a matter of whether I want to one shot top up my MA to the current BHS of $71500 to supercharge my SA  or just $8K a year to qualify for more tax relief in the following years. Thanks for replying,btohqsg
Unless you absolutely have the need to supercharge your SA (i.e. you have no where else to grow your cash from high interest savings like UOB One  SC Bonus$aver  etc.)  there's no real rush to hit FRS on SA.Just use VCMA as a tax relief vehicle and top-up 8k yearly  once you hit BHS  you can start doing RSTU if you need the tax relief (after the BHS increase of course).,btohqsg

Nope. Normal Groceries mcc shld be excluded.,btohqsg

The 1% bonus interest? There's no other bonus interest promos since 1 Jan 24.,btohqsg
SGD 2500 TSLA share reward over 1 year = annualized rate of 2.5% only....,btohqsg
I mean the promo interest rate.,btohqsg
While this is true  it assumes that you didn't use the funds to earn returns on Moneybull or buy Equities on Webull,btohqsg
"If you search ""post same day""  there are some dp that confirms which merchants will post transactions on same day  in case you need to clock the remaining amounts by today.Else  most merchants will clock at least 1 business day after the transaction.",btohqsg

Hi all  just to check amaze + CRMC pay online to ICA is it consider a qualifying spend? As i know any form of travel is excluded.,btohqsg
Still a far cry from the offer in the past few months,btohqsg

Most likely 5399 unless others have Something to share  block your card then do a simulated transaction to be sure,btohqsg
Card blocking only works Dbs card I believe which I do not have.,btohqsg
Yes I am gonna ditch this card. Sayonara.I left with citi rewards mastercard and ocbc 90¬∞N mastercard.Is it OK to have both credit cards as mastercard? Should I switch to ocbc 90¬∞N visa?,btohqsg
Great cos what I know mastercard can only be used to pay AIA insurance renewal premiums.,btohqsg
But both cards also don't get rewards from paying insurance..,btohqsg
I actually use them to hit the spend so that I can get their annual fee waived,btohqsg
Not planning to get the 10k miles on OCBC 90¬∞N?,btohqsg
Oh? I already got the card since 1 Jan. Am I still eligible? How to be eligible? Sorry. There might be a post but I'm unsure,btohqsg
I mean the renewal miles. Pay the annual fee for the 10k miles.,btohqsg
Is it worth it by dollar cost? Sorry need a little enlightenment,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre desperate for miles  perhaps yes. Else at cpm of 1.9+  not really.,btohqsg
Hi what is the best miles card for private hospital bill now?,btohqsg
I realised that HSBC T1 does not accept hospital bills and my wife is delivering in 14 days. Help please!,btohqsg
FYI im going to thomson medical hospital,btohqsg
Amex KFA  Maybank Visa Infinite and SCB Journey card (1.2mpd) Amex KFB 1.1mpd,btohqsg
Thanks for the response! Does thomson medical accept amex card?,btohqsg
DBS live fresh seems to be nerfedThe following changes to the DBS Live Fresh Card Cashback Programme will be effective from 1 March 2024:1.Cardmembers will earn unlimited0.3% base cashbackon all eligible spend.2.Upon hitting the minimum spend requirement ofS$800per calendar month  Cardmembers will enjoy up to6% cashback on Shopping and Transport spend(includes in-store  contactless and online transactions made in Singapore and overseas):‚Ä¢Additional 5.7% cashback on Shopping (capped at S$50 per calendar month)‚Ä¢Additional 5.7% cashback on Transport (capped at S$20 per calendar month)3.With the introduction of the additional cashback above  the card benefits of up to 5% cashback on Contactless and Online spend  and the extra 5% Green Cashback on Sustainable spend will be discontinued.,btohqsg
So i literally cannot use any card at thomson medical for miles ah?üòÇ,btohqsg
You only have Amex? Can apply for scb journey?,btohqsg
Both amex cards not accepted. The maybank visa has a ridiculous annual fee. And Im still waiting for april for a full cycle to restart my scb free gift,btohqsg
According toheymax.aiHSBC Advance card gives cash rebate.Miles doesn‚Äôt seemed to offer anything higher than 0.4mpd,btohqsg
Can also consider amex platinum card... good esp for new customer as need to clock $6k to get the bonus miles,btohqsg
But OP going Thomson Medical which doesn‚Äôt accept Amex.,btohqsg
Heymax is inaccurate for this case  it shows earned miles by HSBC T1‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Wah sad.. heng i going for mount alvernia,btohqsg
Actually UOB Visa Infinite Metal works (1.4 mpd for hospital)  heymax never shows it ü§£,btohqsg
This has a ridiculous annual fee also right?,btohqsg
Also generous sign up bonus üòÑ,btohqsg
Sigh  I guess I can only stick to standard charted cashback card for that measly 1.5%,btohqsg
ocbc infinity got 1.6%  slightly better. sign up as new customer can get ipad too  with $500 spend within 30 days,btohqsg
OCBC does not have hospitals in eligible spend right?,btohqsg
Unless it‚Äôs Voyage card. Again  hefty annual fee üòÑ,btohqsg
Scb is a good option. But im waiting for my free moneysmart/singsaver gift in April,btohqsg
Tried blocked amaze and transact . It did not show up on activities,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt block the card. Just turn off everything in settings (online  in-store  overseas etc etc) but leave the card unlocked OR link to empty wallet.,btohqsg
Hi can i ask for the sc bonussaver account is it worth it to use? I am curently using ocbc 360,btohqsg
I went with the moneysmart promo. Does that count as sign up bonus?,btohqsg
Anyone know for the UOb earmark promo  would the funds remain in the account just that the available balance will be less the earmarked amount?,btohqsg
the 20 000 miles welcome bonus with minimum spend of S$1 000 can use HSBC T1  but only 1k is sufficient,btohqsg
Think u just need to apply a high annual fee if u want miles. But then again these cards all need 120k salary requirements,btohqsg
Hello everyone. Anyone know if the amaze card can use in Taiwan?I tried to pay a wedding shoot company  they keep saying got declined.Already confirmed that both my amaze card and Citi rewards card enabled overseas use.,btohqsg

If I use krispay  the mcc will be based on the merchant mcc? No change of mcc if via krispay?,btohqsg
You need to make sure your ADB for this month is $500 more than previous month ADB  it might not be just deposit $500 to fulfill the criteria  especially when 1st is a non working day.,btohqsg

That one should be just base interest  comes every EOM.The bonus interest comes every 2nd for me.,btohqsg
I see... Thank you for letting me know. I'll check again tomorrow üëç,btohqsg
Based on my current parameters of hitting the 2 criteria with about $20k in the account  the interest should be 3.8% of $20k right?,btohqsg
I saw this and I was worried too. The website says just spend + salary. But this page shows otherwise  as though the 3 giro isneeded,btohqsg
"Hmm but it says ""or"" in the app. Tell you what  if I get the ""interest rewards"" within this week  I'll update this convo bah. You guys know my base parameters.",btohqsg
Or is correct  you can either fulfil spend+salary or spend+giro to get the bonus interest. But interest awarded is lower for the spend+giro option,btohqsg
If via ShopBack pay  will change merchant MCC code?,btohqsg
Can you share the source? I read the website  maybe I overlooked this,btohqsg

No. It's 3.8% p.a.  of your MAB. Unless you guarantee your MAB is 20k  i.e. day 1 to day 31 is 20k  your interest will vary.But if you confirm your MAB is 20k  your bonus interest of 3.8% p.a. will be $64ish.,btohqsg

quick (and probably dumb question) lets say I wanna pay my Citi (which is the Billing Organization  BO) cards via GIRO using HSBC EGA  I need to get and fill the forms from Citi then submit it to Citi for them to process it  correct?,btohqsg
Yes correct. Unless the BO have eGIRO.,btohqsg
ah thanks!1) currently except for BOC and ICBC  all other banks do not support eGIRO for CC payments right?2) eGIRO qualifies for EGA's 1% cashback?,btohqsg

Which payment mode should i use? Sorry i should specify being physically at the grocery store,btohqsg
Unless u link citi crmc to amaze and use amaze for the instore payment. Hsbc revo via contactless for grocery should have 10x,btohqsg
Contactless being paywave which is limited to 200sgd right?,btohqsg
Alot of paywave already can do more then 200  depend on store terminal,btohqsg
Also if i made an online purchase using hsbc revo on 31 jan  but until now the merchant side still pending  will the reward points count towards jan or feb?,btohqsg
Hsbc should be based on posting date i think,btohqsg
Guess i have to wait for the statement to confirm,btohqsg
those who sign up EGA in Dec  remember to take out your money if you didn't yesterday,btohqsg
As long as you fulfill the criteria in the statement month  you get the cashback. That's what concurrent means. Read up on the tnc to check when it credits you the cashback.,btohqsg
May i know the reason why arh,btohqsg
Hmm does hsbc even know about this issue?,btohqsg
sorry I mean the special promo that give bonus interest for Dec and Jan only,btohqsg

The card can only have one type either visa or Mastercard and I think Citibank is encouraging people to use Mastercard. Hence given a choice  Mastercard or visa would you all recommend?,btohqsg
What card is that? Citi Rewards?,btohqsg
Yeah Citi Rewards and Citi Cash Back are due for renewal  hence they offering me to switch to Master from visa  soon when my Citi PremierMiles too when expiring,btohqsg
I know Citi Rewards can have two versions  I‚Äôm using both version myself. but if you have to choose one  Mastercard will be better because you can pair with Amaze.,btohqsg

Not true. Just apply Mastercard version without converting/cancelling Visa. Many people hold both!,btohqsg
Hi  if I'm using maybank fnf to order hamper (msia website)  will it charge to my msia spent category? Or I shd use amaze to convert it to sgd better?,btohqsg

Hi everyone  i have a question  i am currently using my full OA amount to pay for my home loan  don‚Äôt think its a good idea with the accrued interest over time.if i have a chunk of cash to do voluntary top up to my CPF account  should i prioritize1) voluntary housing refund all amount and stop paying using OA  then VCMA to BHS  then RSTU to FRS.Or2) VCMA to BHS  then RSTU to FRS  if got excess only voluntary housing refund.Or can help me with prioritizing VCMA  RSTU  VHR  stop homeloan with OA?Many thanks in advance!!,btohqsg
Hi can i use cardup to pay for poly fees?,btohqsg
I saw something like need to hit min spend first. Otherwise ringgit spend goes to 1 of 5 categories chosen or other spending,btohqsg
Best to charge in MYR so you get the 8% rebate which should be better than the slightly favourable exchange rate via Amaze.,btohqsg
oh something new  I used to hold both but in the end because of annual fee  I only left with visa.just curious how you decide with to use when you owns both visa and master?,btohqsg
This is quite subjective and depends on your context. If your loan rate is lower than OA‚Äôs 2.5%  then don‚Äôt use OA to fully settle the home loan as keeping the OA will yield higher interest.If you‚Äôre still working then VCMA is a good option (cap at BHS or $8k whichever lower) to lower than taxable income. From the sound of it your cash is def more than $8k. Again compare your loan rate vs OA‚Äôs 2.5% to decide VHR or not,btohqsg
Accrued interest still your money if you need to return the money. üò¨No need to really VHR  can just focus on VCMA/RSTU for tax relief.,btohqsg
By loan rate you mean my loan interest? Yes my loan interest 3.2% is much higher than 2.5%.Say i tio lottery and got a huge chunk of cash i should just go VCMA then RSTU then excess only VHR?,btohqsg
The cons of having accrued interest is that we are funding that interest instead of the government.Of course  horizon and liquidity matters. RSTU is for retirement,btohqsg
Also subjective on how well you think you can take care and grow your money (i.e. investments) outside of CPF,btohqsg
If you read AK‚Äôs blog (ASSI)  can make the govt fund our retirement is better than self fund. 2.5%/4% is good moneySome people like to keep as cash as they‚Äôre confident to invest and yield higher than CPF rate,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows if i pay for education via Amaze linked card do i earn any miles for that for UOB?,btohqsg
Really depends on your preference. Some people like to keep the leverage and use the extra cash to grow more money (ie equities etc). Some are more conservative and rather be debt free asap so they‚Äôre not tied to a day job and have the flexibility to quit whenever they like.But VCMA is definitely higher priority as it funnels your mandatory contributions to SA to boost your FRS progress whilst allowing you to save immediate tax which hopefully you‚Äôre putting the money saved and making it grow,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúUob educations‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.Alternatively  can usehttps://heymax.aito check.,btohqsg
In the zero rate environment (pre Covid inflation)  it‚Äôs wiser to keep home loans so as to earn the arbitrage between OA‚Äôs 2.5% and loan‚Äôs ~1% rate.,btohqsg
Hihi  whats the mcc for shopback vouchers now? All are 7299 is it?,btohqsg
Situation now also a bit dicey as US Fed rates are expected to come down within the next year which will affect home loan rates,btohqsg
I consider myself not professional enough to get more than what CPF can offer  often burn my hand rather than growing it well  so looking for the best and safest way to grow.So the priority should be1) VCMA to BHS2) RSTU to FRS3) VHR to OA  and then use OA to invest perhaps? If i wanted higher returns.,btohqsg
Take note the first two top ups has a shared cap of $8k for tax relief,btohqsg
Your question should be does uob even give miles for education mcc as most bank exclude education mcc. Amaze wont change the mcc,btohqsg
bc im trying to use cardup but i cant find the bank acc number to pay to them,btohqsg
Will dbs wwmc give 4mpd for mcc 7299?,btohqsg
How do you usually pay them?,btohqsg
Only UOB VIM gives points for education. If you are below 120K criteria  next best option is Maybank Manchester United (and pray ManU wins like they did yesterday).,btohqsg
usually directing use AXS to pay them which result in me losing miles,btohqsg
currently only hv UOB Ladys and Privimiles,btohqsg
Yes if online  no if recurring,btohqsg
Go to this website  download the GIRO form n check what is the bank account number printed on the form. Call your school to double confirm the accuracy of the bank account numbers to transfer.,btohqsg
Need to be careful when using OA to invest. If you‚Äôre not confident of beating 2.5% risk free return on your cash outside CPF  it won‚Äôt be any easier trying to do it in the CPFIA.,btohqsg
I mean can just go endowus to track S&P500 those right,btohqsg
Remember got fees  so after minus fees must beat 2.5%.,btohqsg

Hi all  may I check. If I already have the DBS yuu AMEX card  and now I apply for the DBS yuu VISA card..Bonus Award is capped at 15 600 yuu Points (worth up to S$78) per calendar month. << Is this $78 worth of points per card  since I will have one AMEX one VISA? So total is $156  if I spend $600 on each card?Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Edited for clarity  Singsaver promo till 15 feb  citi plus top-up promo till 29 Feb,btohqsg
Hi all  can I confirm if both online and contactless payments are eligible for UOB Lady Card rewards?,btohqsg
Yes  it is based on mcc for the bonus point,btohqsg
Can my wife transfer her miles on her credit card to my krisflyer account ?,btohqsg
I have citi rewards and ocbc 90N cards. Both are earning miles. Which card earn miles better? Seems like citi rewards? I read citi rewards can earn 10mpd. Ocbc 90N earns 6.5 miles per 5 dollar block.Ocbc miles won't expire. Citi rewards points will expire after 5 years. If convert to krisflyer miles will be 3 years expiry.My expenditure are frugal. Mostly food  grocery and retail. Online would be shopee and food panda those,btohqsg
How come Citi reward can earn 10mpd?,btohqsg
I don't know but read some where due to its bonus rewards. Or I mistook the numbers / formula / conversion from rewards points to miles. I need someone enlighten me,btohqsg
Citi rewards earn 10 Thank you points per dollar. 10 TY points can be converted to 4 miles.If you choose Citi rewards  base on your spending pattern  you need to get Amaze card.,btohqsg
I think can try chat assist? If not should be able to call in I think,btohqsg
So citi rewards is 4mpd and better than ocbc 90N,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best card to pay for uni fees? Isit uob abs?,btohqsg
You mean need amaze card to have 10 TY points?,btohqsg
Max $1k per statement month exclude Travel  hotel n airlines related. Check the TnC. Nobody can tell you everything in short message here. üòÑ,btohqsg
Without amaze card I still can get 10 TY points per dollar right? Depending on what spend based on tnc,btohqsg
U need to read TnC what offline purchase can get 4miles. The rest of offline get 0.4 miles.,btohqsg
Uob evol dont exclude traveling booking via online I suppose I don't see it in their tnc,btohqsg
Since uob Evol in their Cashback is listed as online payment so I suppose pay on trip. Com or Expedia work,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website also proposes a list of best credit cards to use. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
HSBC Revo saw new say is now Exclude traveling,btohqsg
So amaze card is nothing to do with getting 4 miles right?,btohqsg
For some categories. For others you need to pair with amaze.,btohqsg
Convert offline to online so can u can earn 4mpd for online category when you make offline purchase.,btohqsg
I see. Thank you so much for the tips. Then I would probably use this card for online transactions then. Cos I don't plan to get amaze card. I will also read the tnc which category that gives bonus rewards,btohqsg
Whats the best CC for earning miles now?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs base on the GIRO deduction date. üòá,btohqsg
It's quite hard to hit $30 000 spending per month,btohqsg
When does UOB stash bonus interest come in? For the 2023 Christmas promo,btohqsg
U mean earmark bonus. Usually around the same time as your earmark happens,btohqsg
Hi all  i am currently using uob one credit card and SC unlimited cashback card.Would like to ask how can i pair either card to get good rates for spending overseas (similar to trust card) and still earn cashback?I understand topping up to wallet  such as youtrip  is excluded,btohqsg
If u want good rate then have to consider other cards pair with amaze  or top up amaze wallet. Uob one is visa hence ‚ùå,btohqsg
U can pair sc unlimited (now renamed as simply cash) with amaze.Although:1.5% cashback - 2.5% amaze cost + 0.5% amaze points = net 0.5% loss/costU might want to consider using higher (but more troublesome) Mastercards that give higher cash back if mcc matches.,btohqsg
I also wanna know‚Ä¶. 6.8% for moomoo cashplus promo is quite tempting even if it‚Äôs only for a month. Anyone sign up for this promo b4?,btohqsg

Which cards do you guys recommend for dental? Will hsbc revo and citi rewards get bonus points?,btohqsg
Citi Rewards with Amaze should work but not sure if extra 1% fee. HSBC Revo no,btohqsg
If you have UOB PPV also can.,btohqsg
But actually what is the benefit of paying with amaze linked for sg transactions? Citi rewards will still get bonus points if i use directly right?,btohqsg
Amaze converts offline spending to online spending  reason why you can get 4mpd. Dental MCC is not part of offline whitelist so you cannot use directly.,btohqsg
Ah i see!! Thx for the clarification,btohqsg
When you guys use HeyMax to check mcc and it recommends best cards for spending  why does it show cards for foreign spending when the vendors are in sg?,btohqsg
Hi  I have applied for the DBS altitude Amex card. have signed up for the card via dbs digibanking and and received the card on 31st Jan. Recalled seeing on milelion that there was a promo going on where I can get 16k miles if I spend $2k within 1 month with no annual fees. But the promo has been removed from the website on milelion and singsaver now. I called dbs to ask if I am still eligible for the promo. Was told that if I could provide the promo code  they can add it into the system for me. Does anyone know what is the promo code for this ?,btohqsg
"With a quick search with ""dbs altitude promo""  I found this:https://t.me/HMSGHive/1358I don't think there's any promo for DBS Altitude after 31 Nov 23.",btohqsg

Hi guys  can I ask whether do your know why CPF deducted lesser for investment? Eg; if you choose 20k from your OA to invest in T bills  but why they did not deduct 20k but deducted slightly lesser? Is it there is a cost somewhere?,btohqsg
At maturity  your amount will go up to $20k  the difference being your interest,btohqsg
T bills pay you the interest upfront  as a discount to your initial investment value,btohqsg
does this mean that whatever i invested  then the interest they supposedly will give at maturity will be minus off first? then they deduct that amt from CPF. and at maturity  the returns will be back to the amt i invested?,btohqsg
Yes youll get back the original amount you invested  e.g. 20k,btohqsg
Hi all  last December I was busy so I paid my cc bill without checking my statement. Now I found that there's an annual fee and it's gst charges. Is it too late for me to waive it?,btohqsg

another qn  is it worth to get the citi premiermiles cc? like to pay loans or daily spending. but for loans  currently do not have any big loans to pay off. but heard the miles accumulation is ok? any suggestions?,btohqsg
Maybe you can read up the tnc to see if it fits your spending. All the best to your miles accumulation journey.,btohqsg

Hi a quick question regarding uob rising dragonDoes incremental fresh fund mean 20k or 50k in a single transferOr can I transfer 20k then followed by 30k and another 20k later on in the month?,btohqsg
Thank you Queenie for sharing it with me,btohqsg
It's literally in the name. Incremental of fresh funds.1. Register the incremental funds amount you want to earmark in an eligible account during the qualifying period.2. Deposit the incremental funds (amounts that are above the reference point will be eligible) by the end of the qualifying period.3. Wait for the funds to get earmarked on the date stated in the table  based on your registered qualifying period.4. Cash credit will be deposited into the account on the earmarking day.5. Earmarked amount will be unusable but will still be kept in your account earning interests until end of earmarking period.For UOB Rising Promo  the reference point is the total balance in all your UOB accounts on 30 Dec  10:30pm.E.g. if you only have UOB One account and registered it for 50k earmark  you need to have 50k + reference point in the account there by earmarking date. To answer your question:yes  you can even deposit $1 50k times if you want.Promo table for reference:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163442,btohqsg

Correct. But it‚Äôs only good if you spend a substantial amount on the merchants that get the bonus  otherwise you might take a long time to accumulate enough to convert to miles.I found the card useful as I can combine the points with my journey card and transfer to non-KF ffp.,btohqsg

Dependent on merchant. Can be same day  can also be 4-5 days. On average usually 2 days for me.,btohqsg
If they wanna take the full 10 business days they can lol.Absolutely not much of a reason for the merchant to process it quick as the money is already transferred to them the moment you spend it.But after 10 days if they don't process it then the transaction will be reversed ü§™,btohqsg

Hi gurus  I have a UOB one card and absolute amex on the way  if I occasionally want to spend in JB (Ringgit)  online spend (USD) and Thailand (THB). Which currency card should I apply for for these 3 currencies.1. Amaze?2. Youtrip?3. Other recommendation?Thank you!,btohqsg
"Wait  what?What ""currency card"" should I apply for these 3 currencies? What does that mean?",btohqsg
It sounds like you are implying each currency will get its own card. That's not the case. You just have the opportunity to open multiple wallets for different currencies,btohqsg
And each wallet is linked to just a single cardThe benefit of holding money in the respective wallets is that you are holding them at a particular rate. But this shouldn't really either be considered a pro or a con because FX is volatile and unpredictable. Unless you have a strong feeling that a particular currency will strengthen vs others...?,btohqsg
Fwiw  i feel all the multicurrency cards are all about the same (especially in terms of rate). There are plenty of comparisons online.For amaze I suppose you mean amaze wallet (since you have no mastercards)  they give 1% in form of points for fx txns. Cannot store myr.Youtrip cannot store myr and thb (i think).Other recommendation is probably Revolut because you can withdraw money out (the rest are all stuck inside)To store myr u need ichange (but I usually transfer to tng wallet because ichange app is... buggy),btohqsg
SDIC doesn't cover privileged banking accounts  IIRC,btohqsg
"I generally feel multi currency wallets are overrated  for the following reasons1) SGD is not a ""shit"" currency (i.e. Leaving your SGD in your bank account  even if earning 0% interest  is no worse than holding MYR and earning 5% p.a. on it)2) you don't have a crystal ball that can help you predict whether a particular currency is likely to go up or down vs other currencies3) even if you did  there is opportunity cost in holding a currency (or anything  for that matter)4) piggybacking off the example above  what actually is the benefit in holding a currency vs SGD  considering the general strength and stability of SGD? Imagine you ""hold"" MYR to lock in the rate. You go in 3 months and you've lost 2%. Of course it can go the other way  but hence why I said #2What's more important? Good FX rates with low spread  low fees/surcharges",btohqsg
Yes I do meant e-wallets. I do have a debit FX with Mastercard as well. Does topping up with the Mastercard have any benefits? Or can I top up using UOB one card to clock the 2k spend or absolute to get the 1.7% cash back?,btohqsg
Most e-wallets don't allow top up from Amex so using absolute isn't even an option,btohqsg
You only have that option for grab. And UOB absolute only pays 0.3% on grab top ups,btohqsg
