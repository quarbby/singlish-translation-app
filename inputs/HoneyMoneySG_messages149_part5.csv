if you have medical insurance for dental etc  use CDC to pay for dental work and then claim it back (not guaranteed),btohqsg
I ever use cdc at clinic before and not able to claim back from insurance:(,btohqsg
yea  that's why I said not guaranteed. I got lucky with my dentist  I guess,btohqsg
Plan to move my savings to more investment as interest rate is going down big time.,btohqsg
Ocbc not yet  not sure why they so slow  including the credit card statement also so slow,btohqsg
What rate should I put for the bid field? To pay with money from CPF OA.,btohqsg
wah this is investment advice liao.. who dare to answer you..,btohqsg
What is the minimum % I should consider? Since OA is giving 2.5%,btohqsg
Worth to join SCB premier banking to enjoy the signup rewards?,btohqsg
I wanted to check with them the spending for this month has to still be the full $800 or not despite me just receiving the card yesterday  and going overseas.The CS just casually mentioned spending must not be through third party. Which then I asked and it was mentioned example amaze or youtrip which I got confused.,btohqsg
it USED to be a good deal because you get welcome cash rewards PLUS you get to put your cash in a 99.9999% safe Savings account earning high interest rates (it was 5% Wealthsaver last time).NOW different story. I went to see see and there wasn't any details of any promotional savings account.So where will you park your incoming funds then. It might have to be Marathon Esavers account which the rate is meh meh only.So my advice is find out exactly what is the best deal now (don't seem to have any good deals now)... before you dive in.Try not to do for those where you are forced to invest.,btohqsg
These 2 OUTDATED 2023 documents are my constant BENCHMARK on whether a New Priority Banking promo is worth it or not. It has to be this standard before I will bite.Note that these 2 promo ran CONCURRENTLY and CAN STACK.,btohqsg

hi guys  singsaver launched a UOB credit cards' promotion in Oct 2024. i signed up for UOB lady's 12/10/24  card got approved 21/10/24  activated the physical one when i received it on 25/10/24. i hit the minimum 500 @ 508.xx on 11/11/24 and have yet to hear back from them on the rewards. has anyone happened to receive it yet? i've also reached out to them 7 days ago @info@singsaver.com.sgbut no reply. anyone has any idea what's going on?previously when i signed up for CRMC it was really fast for the rewards,btohqsg
Did the TnC indicate 4-6 months? I applied many many years ago  I remember the TnC at that time did indicate more than 3-4 months to receive the rewards. Not sure any change since then.,btohqsg

"Hi  does anyone knows that whether all Amaze's transaction consider as ""online"" transaction. I read it somewhere that all transaction would be considered as ""online"" transaction less travel.I am thinking to link it to citi rewards card to earn the 4 mpd for ""online"" category.Thanks in advance.",btohqsg
Please note that the 4mpd is capped at $1000 per statement month,btohqsg
"Thanks  but can I clarify that even i use the amaze card to pay for restaurant  it will still clock as ""online"" transaction?",btohqsg
Amaze card changes offline to online without changing the MCC code,btohqsg
I'm not so familiar on the MCC code thingy  I also read that when using amaze  the MCC would retain the original MCC. Then if MCC for dining at restaurant is MCC XXXX  how would it clock as the online MCC.,btohqsg
Everything will be online but you need to ensure the MCC is not excluded for rewards,btohqsg
"Cause the 4 mpd for citirewards only applies to online spending and shopping  thus  asking if dining at restaurant (linked to Amaze)  would consider as ""online"". Sorry for the noob queries. üòÇ",btohqsg
You need to pay through amaze card.By pairing the amaze card  all offline transactions will be converted to online transactions.,btohqsg
So long if you pay through amaze card  it will be online,btohqsg
Take a step back.Mcc is merchant code.Online/offline/contactless is payment method.Amaze changes payment method to online. Tapping amaze card will convert transaction from dining offline to dining online. Mcc doesn't change.,btohqsg
Thank you all. Everything is crystal clear to me now! üôè,btohqsg

So today (Saturday) I called Citibank62255225and got Annual Fee on Citi Cashback card waived without having to speak to any officerConsistent with my Citi Ready Credit waiver experience:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/236051Wonder if it is because it is weekend the Loans Team are not working so it can be done without speaking to any officer?TLDR: For Citibank credit card annual fee waiver  try on weekend might be faster?,btohqsg
