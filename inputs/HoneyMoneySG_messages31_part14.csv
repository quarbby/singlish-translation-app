Which is the best dbs card to apply for? Either miles or Cashback works for me,btohqsg
Depends on how you spend. But a good cashback card from dbs in general is the live fresh card.,btohqsg
Does buying usdt counts towards minimum spend requirement or it is a different type of transaction,btohqsg
For local grocery and dining maybe. Overseas and online spend won't be on this card,btohqsg
You can also look at posb everyday card in this case since online spend won't be on this card.,btohqsg
Does it make sense to lockup a large portion of CPF in FD given i usually let it stay with CPFB and will only be using it for housing downpayment down the line (will not be depositing this share),btohqsg
Why not consider Tbills then? Also can use CPF oa,btohqsg
But look at the min requirements for certain cashback also. Not as straightforward as live fresh which just needs 500 monthly for all cashback.Everyday card needs 800 to unlock certain cashback categories like dining. Within dining  in restaurant vs food delivery also yield different % cashback.Both cards have capped cashback also  since the % are fairly high. 3-10%.,btohqsg
Shall take a look at it  thanks for the suggestion üëç,btohqsg
800 abit too high for me. 500 still achievable,btohqsg
Typo  600 not 500. Live fresh seems to be the better choice for you then.Online  contactless and sustainable spending all cashback at 5% and limit of $20 (basically to hit you have to spend 400 for that category).If you take bus/mrt  simplygo is 10% because contactless + sustainable spending.,btohqsg

Hi what benefits of adding trust credit card in the ntuc app for payment in kopitiam?For what I observed  regarding what credit card u use will still get 10% discount and earn link points.If I use other credit card e.g. standard chartered card  I still can earn 2% rebate instead of using trust bank credit card.,btohqsg
It depends if u wanna use trust card as your daily card. Some ppl use it to meet the fpg spending.,btohqsg
Call them ba. Cant be dont have one,btohqsg
Should show in your UOB One app though,btohqsg
Holy sheet dbs website is dogshit unusable,btohqsg
That gave me a good laugh,btohqsg
How do I even verify my mobile number I type one number and it immediately disappears,btohqsg
None of the local banks have a functional website,btohqsg
I was trying to use internet explorer but that is also dead,btohqsg
This is too frustrating to continue....I'm not going to call or go down to the branch man....not worth my time,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure they recommend chromium based browsers. Internet explorer should be gone for good üíÄ,btohqsg
Yes I've tried chrome and edge all same problem,btohqsg
Are you trying to apply for the card rn?,btohqsg
I would suggest doing it on the app if you're an existing dbs customer. Previously I applied all also through app,btohqsg
Maybe I'll try on the app when Im in a better mood,btohqsg
