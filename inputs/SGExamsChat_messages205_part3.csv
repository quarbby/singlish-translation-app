work done = energy converted ma,btohqsg
sian i not this year take,btohqsg

But itâ€™s just like the propeller trick question from 2018,btohqsg
The force of the water in propellor?,btohqsg
That one is super straightforward if ur careful,btohqsg
last year got a qn the answer is the copper poles will have some electric field thing and attract,btohqsg

That one idk I just cancel LOL,btohqsg
rip i didnt understand the q,btohqsg

So angry with myself cos I did the correct working but still saw the options wrongly ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg

Both physics and chem were like that for me,btohqsg

people who get 90+ for chem,btohqsg
I've never seen such holy numbers beforr,btohqsg
there are people who get that score,btohqsg
I think my chem would be like 82% if mcq I get near full marks so I guess Iâ€™ll drop to A2,btohqsg
As usual my practical was shit,btohqsg
I love how Bedok is literally rubbing it in our faces,btohqsg
i need full marks for mcq,btohqsg
