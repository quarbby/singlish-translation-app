she thinks by agreeing w wtv i say will piss me off but uh no,btohqsg
just trying to say she need not â€˜relaxâ€™,btohqsg

uh i listen to avril lavigne,btohqsg
wait i donâ€™t think anybody left any disparaging or condescending comments about nt students,btohqsg
but iâ€™m certain that we do not condone such a behaviour of looking down on anybody here,btohqsg
donâ€™t look at this chat right now  itâ€™s becoming too toxic of an environment!,btohqsg
I pointed out your English errors even before you told us youâ€™re an NT student. We have nothing against NT students bruvva  yâ€™all cool,btohqsg
yea you want an explanation you get one here,btohqsg
Your english is so bad. So that means is a insult?,btohqsg
itâ€™s not an insult itâ€™s literally an error we r pointing out so that you can improve on it,btohqsg
Tbh i cant distinguish btw heavy metal and rock songs ðŸ˜€,btohqsg
oh um sorry but Jennifer edited the following message which originally said something along the lines of â€˜you may now leave thotâ€™,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s from a meme  it means nothing really lol search it up,btohqsg
hm okay.. but we mustnâ€™t assume that others wonâ€™t be affected by it,btohqsg
if youâ€™re sensitive to other peoples feelings that is,btohqsg
Heâ€™s not offended by that  he wrongly thinks weâ€™re treating him differently because heâ€™s an NT student,btohqsg
Excuse me ah dey.Even if dun speak lah leh lor in some what? US stream or uk stream. They won't correct me also what.,btohqsg
from an outsiders perspective  that was quite discriminatory and rude to be very honest haha,btohqsg
itâ€™s ok! itâ€™s turned into quite a toxic environment to be honest,btohqsg
if u not happy ppl look down,btohqsg
why r u adding fuel to the fireâ€¦,btohqsg
i think katie left the chat isit idk eh,btohqsg
Isa typing an essay of rebuttal,btohqsg
I understand :) but  not everyone understands those as you clearly realise since you said â€˜thereâ€™s bound to be understanding gapsâ€™  so itâ€™ll be better to be more sensitive to others feelings in my opinion. (Just my opinion  donâ€™t have to agree though  Iâ€™m just a piece of trash remember HAHAHA),btohqsg
unless you want to ofc :),btohqsg
You have enforced the opponents points  you must improve on your rebuttal for a more balanced and through essay that considers multiple perspectives,btohqsg
oh Iâ€™m sorry..just giving my opinion although it has no value,btohqsg
sorry for wasting your precious time though!,btohqsg
