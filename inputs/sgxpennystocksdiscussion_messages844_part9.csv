Crude Oily🛢️WTI futures steadied around $89 per barrel on Tuesday  after falling more than 6% in the previous three sessions due to a strong dollar and surging Treasury yields. The dollar scaled fresh ten-month highs against a basket of peers and the 10-year US yield rallied to its highest levels since 2007 as strong US economic data bolstered the view that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates higher for longer. Analysts also noted that a key oil pipeline between Iraq and Turkey looked ready for operations this week which could result in additional oil flows and ease global supply tightness. Meanwhile  markets look ahead to an OPEC+ meeting this week  where it is expected to maintain previously announced output cuts.,btohqsg
