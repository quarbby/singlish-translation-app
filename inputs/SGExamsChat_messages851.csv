no one cares enough when you're in sh,btohqsg
unless whatever area u study & work  they'll tell once u that certain areas require the formal / hard safety boots,btohqsg
safety boots also hv so many diff types,btohqsg
Wait any jc students here with strict code of shoes and clothing?,btohqsg
i see  mostly depends on how their sch principal,btohqsg
last time some jcs v laid-back,btohqsg
anyone can go inside the school grounds as long as u look like a jc student / have a jc shirt of that school,btohqsg
but uh usually its just obv don't break the student conduct until u expose urself,btohqsg
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-families-spent-1-8-billion-on-private-tuition-for-children-in-2023Just curious how much you guys even paid for tuition classes?,btohqsg
probably 1000 for the 2 subjs i took in jc,btohqsg
and i didnt even need tuition for one of those subj tbh,btohqsg
i just went so that i cld spend 2h a week studying that subj,btohqsg
what subjects did you take in jc,btohqsg
i had to take tuition for o level eng because my school's department didnt know wtf they were doing,btohqsg
Sec school and pri sch days I get basic tutoring uh for mostly math 200 + to 300+ per month üòÖüòÖ adjusted for inflation 230 to 330+,btohqsg
Wait  one lesson a week  or?,btohqsg
She had to enroll tutoring for the same reason : poor teaching at  sch,btohqsg
"""for comprehension look through past mistakes"" my brother in christ this isnt mathematics the passage changes every time",btohqsg
I mean  the technique should roughly be the same no?,btohqsg
I only know it was paid per 4 lesson weekly haha approx a month have to pay tutoring centre/tutor,btohqsg
thats the part they didnt teach,btohqsg
Because if you looked through past mistakes you would probably spot what you were missing  what was marked excess denies  etc.,btohqsg
and then the department only churns out one exam paper and answer key per year for all 4 cohorts,btohqsg
and thats the prelim paper üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
How you want the student to score A then?,btohqsg
so the marking was bipolar as hell for internal exams because they were fully relying on someone else's answer key,btohqsg
41.2% dist rate for english this year,btohqsg
i've only ever taken tuition once,btohqsg
but i remember some parents offering me quite a bit to give private tuition after i said i was too busy in my normal schedule,btohqsg
they get away with it because our school's command of english isnt poor and somehow the dept is so bad at both teaching and marking that the students have gone full circle,btohqsg
You could give private tuition to justify buying more $400 pants,btohqsg
i have a lot more shit to pay for now,btohqsg
but the amount of extra work wouldn't justify giving up the little time i have,btohqsg
what subjects are you even gonna take,btohqsg
Haha... this is one reason why I volunteer to come out with materials with ppl online,btohqsg
wait ... you in jc yet?,btohqsg
oh do you want to see one question i set,btohqsg
i studied beforehand so i'm familiar with the entire syllabus,btohqsg
here's one question in fm syllabus,btohqsg
if you want fm materials i made some stuff on DEs and other topics  available online,btohqsg
i mean i can help with anything that isn't the e,btohqsg
I know is partial derivatives notation  so is PDE solving ?,btohqsg
don't you get tired from reading Latex?I find Times New Roman / Arial easier for my eyes to read.,btohqsg
Personally I much prefer the LaTeX font,btohqsg
I could typeset it actually to use a different font,btohqsg
but i'm much more used to the default,btohqsg
Nope  you just need to verify a solution for (b),btohqsg
i type everything in latex now since i write papers,btohqsg
I cannot expect FM student to use Green's functions or whatever to solve PDE,btohqsg
Does it auto sync to the cloud or GitHub or something lol,btohqsg
personally i just write the latex code in vscode and it compiles on change,btohqsg
I can imagine the horror your laptop dies   and you need to rewrite your  research paper from scratch again?,btohqsg
J1... clb hmm some guy on r/sgexams told is sec 3 level cl,btohqsg
Not sure if true or not since I dun take clb but regular cl,btohqsg
you can configure your editor to use it,btohqsg
mainly bc i need to collab with professors,btohqsg
so they can all edit it,btohqsg
before recently i just used a local version of texstudio,btohqsg
it's gaining traction recently as a much clear alternative to latex,btohqsg
given i still use latex due to its much more mature ecosystem,btohqsg
yea i've seen it but the collab reason is a big part of why i wouldn't switch rn,btohqsg
i believe that's only on the web app,btohqsg
SiaoYou also got documents for Chinese,btohqsg
i did say i'm using overleaf and it lets me give perms to collaborators to edit,btohqsg
anyway the journals i submit to have their own template,btohqsg
personally i don't see much reason to switch to smth else atp,btohqsg
also i like how the last part is just saying show that it's a harmonic  ofc without that technical term,btohqsg
Alrdy turned off my brain for 2 months+,btohqsg
quite nice doing math lecture slides with these.,btohqsg
i mean harmonics show up in physics a lot,btohqsg
iirc it is called laplace equation,btohqsg
Then you get the Fast Fourier Transform....,btohqsg
yes and that condition makes it a harmonic function,btohqsg
oh god. my nightmares in Engineering School passing that mod.,btohqsg
"ü§î just curious  how ""banana"" is your mandarin level?You can speak Mandarin well enough  but can't recall/recognize Characters is it?",btohqsg
Can speak-ish but even thats degrading  read and write cmi,btohqsg
This is quite a good book for those Differential Equations stuffs.,btohqsg
for a pure math perspective i would recommend a different book,btohqsg
yeahhh just cover most of the basic essentials.Before go into deep dive into Math Degree.,btohqsg
Most foreign beginners have this issue too   they cannot recall the Chinese characters and get used to the writing system,btohqsg
i basically had one math book bible for my undergrad,btohqsg
still use it unless it's an area that's super outside,btohqsg
Then depends on how creative the teacher   they grind the students into Chinese Language proficiency,btohqsg
Or Japanese if that is ....,btohqsg
I want to actly be proficient in chinese  maybe ill study it in ns or smth lol,btohqsg
mathematical methods for physics and engineering by riley  hobson and bence,btohqsg
to me  I think need to force people toÂÜôÁîüÂ≠ó learning the write the Chinese Characters,btohqsg
same deal where it's just there as a reference to apply,btohqsg
since Americans are hoping into the trend since Tiktok is banned,btohqsg
will check it out when I have the time to review O.D.E.s and P.D.E.s,btohqsg
Lazy  wld rather get As done first,btohqsg
when is your CLB for A-levels lol,btohqsg
otherwise  if your Singapore have Primary School Mandarin textbook PDF from Primary 1-6 and Sec 1-5. Should just restart there  and learn and write Mandarin characters and form sentences.,btohqsg
üòÇ i think its more of a student's capability to recognize characters.Singapore education system down side might be everything is in English. Until student doesn't have the brain power to logic in Mandarin. lol,btohqsg
unless PSLE era  there is a Mandarin Science/Maths syllabus.,btohqsg
Have a friend who can understand Japanese but can't read cl,btohqsg
Lol kinda strange too .... the concept of learning Japanese is quite similar to Chinese in terms of character being nearly similar in meaning,btohqsg
Haha ... being well in multiple languages helps in brain development,btohqsg
Even as adults not too late,btohqsg
American people are mocked online quite often for low rates of bilingualism üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
haha. I think Japanese / Korean system of language is now being simplified with their own characters only hardly remaining any Chinese characters. haha,btohqsg
Pretty sure they need to take an Additional language class like Spanish in high school or other mother tongue,btohqsg
but then there's no standardize test for that?,btohqsg
unless they sit for the A.P. course in school,btohqsg
In China gaokao   students can take 1 foreign language   counted in grades,btohqsg
anyhow being multilingual is kinda hard growing up. üòÇit always a bad mix-match between language until some weird hybrid comes out,btohqsg
Dun worry  you are not alone  learn multi languages is like fun too. Gets more entertainment options online,btohqsg
Like can use more diverse app and understand more content,btohqsg
do you guys got any advice for retaking O's as a priv candidate,btohqsg
And see what's your goal from that exam,btohqsg
If it's to improve your score then see which subj from prev try you scored badly but have the most confidence to score higher.,btohqsg
math pure bio combi chem/phy poa eng,btohqsg
i also tried DAE but hopes not high cause fail math and im pr,btohqsg
My advice is do tys to determine what went wrong with your previous attempt first üòÖüòÖ and review answers key for problems as well,btohqsg
Since is a retake  you dw repeat mistakes again,btohqsg
Sorry for O Level Elitism news but ....,btohqsg
life is better when one blocks mothership,btohqsg
Ok its commendable of the boy to do so but i think its very laughable how ppl think its something that should be applauded,btohqsg
Imo i think health is more impt than any exam,btohqsg
Like if i were his parent i wouldnt have let my kid take the exam lor,btohqsg
Yes  I agree with what you said!,btohqsg
https://www.8days.sg/entertainment/local/hwa-chong-international-student-dior-sneakers-scholarship-poster-840181Difference between International School vs Institute... üòÇ,btohqsg
hopefully that shoe is AI generated. hahaha,btohqsg
halloo ! anyone have any robotics class recommendations for outside sch ? i wna start doing it outside as a hobby :) ( i do python on the side if that helps ‚≠ê ),btohqsg
last time was like Lego Mindstorms so basic stuffs.,btohqsg
if you want to go for the Engineering Route.That would be Arduinos / Raspberry Pis.,btohqsg
Raspberry Pi supports Python? If I recall correctly.,btohqsg
Arduino ones normally you just mod people's code.,btohqsg
Huh..now still have ppl use raspberry pi?,btohqsg
naw i just wna do it on the side üòì,btohqsg
my main focus is coding games etc,btohqsg
But the game sector is almost like dying,btohqsg
I left engineering school in 2020. don't tell me they already phased out Raspberry pi . lel.,btohqsg
Still have use.. just that not much usage,btohqsg
2016-2020 really a pocket burn for most Engineering students. From buying 3D printers to Arduino/Raspberry Pi projects. lol.,btohqsg
Game sector don't even pay 3k for degree holders,btohqsg
just do CS. And jump upto a start up in SG...,btohqsg
just do math + csthen go quant/jokes,btohqsg
Dont do Engineering either... especially in Tech / Semiconductors...,btohqsg
The startup in sg is almost like closing,btohqsg
But game development ppl can be app developer ?,btohqsg
idk bout you  it's not the perfect - metal rice bowl job anymore.,btohqsg
You guys sure or not..even with A1 in the game chart,btohqsg
also the learning curve in Semiconductor Design ...,btohqsg
With the leading for 3 days in appstore,btohqsg
please end up in NTU EEE plz.,btohqsg
heard Micron pays $5k in Singapore right now for Fresh Grads.,btohqsg
Uni grad avg is 5 wat,btohqsg
but then the work culture I heard is kinda toxic from some Business Units.,btohqsg
Cs more provided u find job,btohqsg
Got a relative son cs grad alrdy 8,btohqsg
and most the stuff you learn in Semiconductors aren't transferable to other companies.,btohqsg
Any industry except gaming is gd i supposed so,btohqsg
But i think it wld have more longevity,btohqsg
so yeah...... CS / Programming / Software jobs that way ---->>>>,btohqsg
Cannot even get into ms unless top scholars,btohqsg
I used to thought so. But that's for the EDA Design House tools to say.,btohqsg
I mean ofc FAANG is dam hard,btohqsg
anyhow me worked for Intel Penang for 3 years still peanut pay of RM5.3k ü•≤,btohqsg
you work in Research  you guys get pay in Grants?,btohqsg
i get a stipend from a scholarship rn,btohqsg
U think worth going into semicon?,btohqsg
for Google Singapore  I heard  you need 3 years of external experience  just to be eligible to hiring.When I asked around Google Dev. Club.,btohqsg
semicon just feels like you pigeon hole yourself q a lot,btohqsg
like the starting pay is ok but the ceiling doesn't go super high either,btohqsg
I cant imagine a mundane job doing the same thing,btohqsg
i mean i have a few friends that went semicon,btohqsg
At least semicon R&D shldnt be that repetitive?,btohqsg
R&D side really depends bc a lot of companies leave that to higher degree holders,btohqsg
so unless you're ready to pursue further,btohqsg
i mean one of them here is now in germany doing masters,btohqsg
ntu also has a joint phd programme with globalfoundaries,btohqsg
I tot taiwan and jp more advanced in semicon tbo,btohqsg
i mean TSMC is there yes,btohqsg
I assume the ceiling wld be higher in R&D?,btohqsg
i mean you're alr gonna be put in higher positions from the get go,btohqsg
I tot oso got companies sponsor further studies,btohqsg
But oso semicon wld be less replaced with ai right...?,btohqsg
Ofc no1 has a crystal ball,btohqsg
idk enough about the industry to comment,btohqsg
Depends what you want to do. Semiconductor is a giant pool of hot mess with niche fields,btohqsg
The brain dead jobs typically is Analog IC design üòÇ,btohqsg
I cant imagine mundance office work until i turn grey,btohqsg
If semicon not earning much. Sack the ppl like Dyson,btohqsg
Can go LinkedIn and ask Amrita Nambiar. The Google Dev. group   KL speaker who got into Google Singapore.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs been like that internally in Intel every year,btohqsg
Overnight jobless.. ntuc also cannot step in,btohqsg
My previous department in Intel got dissolved and merged and restructured into newer groups,btohqsg
Basically is you need brain through and process what gibberish your colleagues say or other tech leads  and deliver the items to them üòÇ,btohqsg
And 90 percent of the time is generate the files needed for execution ü•≤ if you not doing actual design work,btohqsg
Which takes up like half of your day.,btohqsg
priorities can change over time ba,btohqsg
Like in movies with rows of office cubicles,btohqsg
Wat do they do all they,btohqsg
either to support a family or so they have money to do what they enjoy outside work,btohqsg
I mean like day to day stuff,btohqsg
oh  we have alot of 20-30 years seniors in Intel penang malaysia.,btohqsg
either they are very passionate in their job,btohqsg
or Intel pay in their paygrade is quite relaxing lol,btohqsg
too bad I was sold out by Intel ü•≤,btohqsg
I tot amd also produces in malaysia,btohqsg
Produces is some subcontracted company called AMD-TF,btohqsg
the actual AMD Design Hub only recently started in 2021 in Penang.,btohqsg
I think oso foxconn produces for amd?,btohqsg
many stages in producing chips nowadays,btohqsg
then TSMC sends to some other wirebonding/packaging process in Malaysia,btohqsg
Finally finished making my own custom OS,btohqsg
I still have my hackintosh files,btohqsg
This doesn't seem like your own kernel,btohqsg
Wasn't mothership meant to be satire news,btohqsg
Kernel is from Samsung cuz no one dares trying to make they‚Äôre own modified one,btohqsg
omg is this tekkichickenbreast from the hit server yaki sauce tub (1.2),btohqsg
i dont watch arcane bro üíÄ,btohqsg
can i ask if people who grad frm cs manage to find a job after graduation since the market is super competitive,btohqsg
market is competitive but cs is still very sought after esp with how many different fields there are for it,btohqsg
you're not restricted to certain industries,btohqsg
My relative son grad got 8k,btohqsg
Feel like ai cuts ut down alot tho,btohqsg
yea i mean that's way higher than the median,btohqsg
I want ask him more during cny,btohqsg
anyway you can look through those grad employment surveys,btohqsg
Dam crazy siah  even my past tuition center cher turned private oso 8k,btohqsg
And his been teaching for like 10++?,btohqsg
But im just comparing how crazy his floor is,btohqsg
depending on what i go for  my first full job post phd can be anywhere from 5-6k to >20k,btohqsg
Phd hard to say on job prospects right?,btohqsg
it's just i gotta make sure to explore opportunities,btohqsg
Computer science jobs might be competitive next time uh,btohqsg
Thousands of students graduating there while competing against foreign talents/digital nomads,btohqsg
Still possible but difficult to go in,btohqsg
Plus post covid can remote work,btohqsg
Making it theoretically speaking possible for employees to work across jurisdiction,btohqsg
some of it is hire fast fire fastso while it's good to get a high salary young  the hard part is to maintain it past 40,btohqsg
personally  I have 1 very good NS mate who specialise in design  got retrenched during covid times. Till now cannot find a suitable job.,btohqsg
Another cousin of mine  in IT. Very high salary.9 months ago got retrenched after company he worked in got acquired. New HR ask why this person salary so high  so just fire.In most cases  fresh grads do just as well for the same job. Might as well take the pay of a late 30s or early 40s person and use it to hire 2 young fresh grads who have more energy  time and drive.,btohqsg
So while looking for a job  do consider longevity of it.Also prep your finances well early in your career. Don't overspend nor spend with the expectation that your income will always be there.,btohqsg
I mean does put some negotiating power into ur next job no?,btohqsg
also depends on your job scope,btohqsg
to be more extreme  a person with 10 years experience doing admin work is no better than a person with <1 yr experience,btohqsg
covid times  it was employee market especially with AI boom.Give another 10 yrs  where most of the sec sch students how graduate  the economy will change again.,btohqsg
my time  which was 2008. IT was the among the lowest paid. No one wanted it.,btohqsg
Just become a day trader... üòÇMy uni friend  same batch as me  got into day trading.Eventually 3 years into working... He has 150k USD in his trading account....,btohqsg
no  IT jobs are easily outsourced. It's just code.Many companies set up branches in places like Vietnam  where salaries are way lower,btohqsg
even has the guts to suggest to his manager to put him on the VSS list  for retrenchment.,btohqsg
I'm like good for you bruh... while I sobbing internally lel,btohqsg
150K USD is quite good at age 30 lol,btohqsg
in life  we can only set goals and aim for success and stability.Luck plays a much larger role,btohqsg
but then  I am not really that keen onto his risk factor la,btohqsg
Then u think not enough  then suddenly become 150k in the red,btohqsg
another tutor friend  age 35 with 4 kids.Was telling me he had only 20k usd in assets.Somehow he dumped all into Tesla  turned it to 50k  then sold and dumped all to Palantir  and at this juncture it had 10X.2 years. 20k usd to >500k usd,btohqsg
meanwhile I just convert my MYR to SGDs ü•≤ I store in Fullerton MMF...,btohqsg
no la  luck always play a role. We can't control that.,btohqsg
yeahhh. that's why I said  he also dare to risk it la,btohqsg
I'm not a financial literate guy can predict the market also lol,btohqsg
got another friend  somehow buy 4d and toto  win many times.,btohqsg
it just happens for some people,btohqsg
the newspaper also had an article on this guy who struck Toto 1st prize twice.,btohqsg
these are minority. If it happens to you  good I happy for you.If it doesn't  that's where our prudence have to come in and help us with rainy days,btohqsg
now hor  at age 40+ (I feel so uncle)Most important is health. Not just of myself  but also of family.,btohqsg
üòÇ idk bout you  but I feel the struggles of financial + keep up with mental well being is getting to most of us youngsters nowadays...,btohqsg
"alot of my friends eventually gave up - chasing the cooperate ladder. Instead choose a more ""laxed"" lifestyle and actually finding some form of meaning in life.",btohqsg
Still waiting for those sunny daysüòî,btohqsg
financial problems will always be there. Because majority of us will always want more.,btohqsg
I gave up 4 yrs into it. Was a scholar at an MNC leh.My 1 yr senior  currently director of the MNC liao.,btohqsg
cfm earn lesser  but i get to send my kids to and fro school everyday.And enjoy all the tea time deals üòÇ,btohqsg
atleast you don't need to worry about messing up the livelihood of hundreds of workers haha,btohqsg
cny go pray to Ë¥¢Á•ûÁà∑ better üòÇ,btohqsg
Which MNc got give scholarship ?,btohqsg
I think is mostly those companies who want to bond talents.,btohqsg
I want  one as I don't one gov one,btohqsg
dunno still have a not. Engineering only,btohqsg
SG's GOV scholarship  that bad meh?,btohqsg
Don't want to work for gov sector,btohqsg
if you are in the correct industry  the uni will have a lot of adverts,btohqsg
Ah ok . I'm in tech but can also pivot to finance .,btohqsg
Why I do not prefer gov sector ?,btohqsg
Oso thinking if semicon cmi pivot to fonance,btohqsg
can pivot  just need be a minor a learning curve I guess.,btohqsg
and you end up within which industry.,btohqsg
Wld be like pre uni ofc,btohqsg
Cfm wont like 2-3 yrs into a degree think aye maybe changeüíÄ,btohqsg
I have friends Studied mechanical -> went Daikin -> sell Panmee -> went back to Sales -> then went back to Banking and Finance.,btohqsg
man i am considering healthcare as a prospect of future career but i heard the negative side of med sch   psych & pharmacist such as other careers earning more money  crazy and hectic scedule  etc. it‚Äôs a stable income and i love helping ppl‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt mind other careers like cs and design as well,btohqsg
"all jobs are ""helping someone"" in some manner.",btohqsg
"medicine most probably is main issue is ""education debt"".",btohqsg
and no income is really stable,btohqsg
when is the ROI... unless you gotten free tuition waivers to practice Meds.,btohqsg
Oh simple reason:1. Heard of top down management for many gov sectors2. Personally  there's a very true stigma that scholars get preference for like promotions etc esp those like president scholars.3. I heard first hand from psc scholars that they quit because their superiors constantly take credit for their work .All of these can exist in private sectors (MNCs) but more evident in gov sectors .,btohqsg
anyhow  just mad how current cost of living has become...,btohqsg
so much burden on fresh grads shoulders nowadays.,btohqsg
Also   I do not want to be stuck in SG which MNC has better probability of allowing me to transfer to overseas branch,btohqsg
SG is too small and has limited opportunities .,btohqsg
The answer most likely no. Else you so lucky to find a MNCs overseas that wants to hire you.,btohqsg
also can you deal with living in some other country alone?,btohqsg
Dk how true from the inside but I've spoken with MNCs like JPM and Bloomberg which allows transfers . (Asked HR),btohqsg
Life finds a way :) .I just want an exit plan from SG.,btohqsg
if the MNC comes here  they are looking to hire someone based here most times.,btohqsg
I mean not like many other countries are doing btr,btohqsg
Most 1st world country got similar issues,btohqsg
Yea but eventually can transfer out,btohqsg
most likely due to cheaper cost of operation  and exploit the hell of out of the employees. /heh/,btohqsg
can't imagine what will happen once Singapore-Johor economic zone once set up,btohqsg
if you are really talented and valued.But remember your talent is now compared to people worldwide and not just within SG,btohqsg
U say not i say oneüíÄ,btohqsg
No like I'm looking for job opportunities eventually in the states,btohqsg
not a place i would like. Imagine guns firing for no reason üòÖ,btohqsg
on the contrary  doing worst  for the typical US  Canada  Australia...,btohqsg
Yea   that's one point but I think many of us eventually have to face,btohqsg
AU and NZ are also good,btohqsg
Australia isn't that livable anymore  from what I understand.,btohqsg
Yea . The UK has knives   the US has guns .,btohqsg
just paying rent alone I heard is like $200+ per week.,btohqsg
mostly hardly have any night life too.,btohqsg
but sounds about right for places like sydney,btohqsg
i mean that goes for Europe as well. it‚Äôs just a culture difference,btohqsg
Thailand and Cambodia have a kidnapping threat .Japan need japaneseKorea needs Korean + usually dominated by the top Korean companiesEurope has a migration restriction.,btohqsg
Man  most places are out alr,btohqsg
sorry if i missed it mentioned earlier but are you working alr or?,btohqsg
grass is always greener on the other side,btohqsg
don't remind me about going to Netherlands. The bloody shop closes at 4pm...,btohqsg
yeahh. need to go to Amsterdam for that night life,btohqsg
which is funny bc i went during the period where the sun set at 10pm,btohqsg
what's the current offering for supper in Singapore tho lol,btohqsg
yup good old red light district,btohqsg
you must be thinking of red light district üòÇ,btohqsg
i went europe for my grad trip,btohqsg
ah. been there  done that. kinda meh.,btohqsg
old uncle eats kiwi from fridge and some oranges.Then down a homemade strawberry banana milkshake with some protein (copy Boost juice bar),btohqsg
is like packed sardines along the red light district,btohqsg
i live at geylang so supper is everywhere,btohqsg
I just find it ironic  how if a tourist pulls out their phone. The windows prostitutes runs out and curses people lol,btohqsg
nothing wrong  just amazes how from an over crowded street some one standing at the windows can capture that haha.,btohqsg
it's like how teachers in a large class can see which students are naughty and not paying attention,btohqsg
oh well  must be some of profession habit I guess.Also they need to conceal their identity.,btohqsg
not the glorious thing about being a prostitute.,btohqsg
oh ya  another culture shocks when I was in the EU  in Coppenhagen.I realized that ambulance provides clean needles for drug addicts hobos. ü•¥,btohqsg
was expecting like bring them to rehab or provide proper shelter in the cold or something.,btohqsg
I heard before some of them treat it as a hobby that earns something.,btohqsg
This is called needle exchange uh,btohqsg
Ofc I can't comment since drugs are bad but they did this to mostly reduce blood borne disease transmission,btohqsg
üòµ‚Äçüí´ i know bout the latter part. but feels kinda bad. this doesn't really resolve the problem.,btohqsg
Any one who did biology knows that there are just too many types of horrendous disease that transmits via blood,btohqsg
Some European societies are too Liberal with drugs,btohqsg
hi guys idk if this is the right place to ask  im keeping stuff vague for privacy but if yk me irl you alr know what im referring to lolso this year im graduating from my sch and today my teachers mentioned writing sgc and there's one section on cca. i do have cca stuff from jc  but there's 1 particular achievement in sec 4 (i created smth that was presented to an MP during my school's honours day)  that im particularly proud of and i would like to include it on my sgc. because im from ip  so i didnt have a sgc   as i technically didnt graduate from my secondary school. so i wanted to include that 1 achievement from sec4 (and only that  the rest im planning to use jc stuff). i asked my teachers and they say they try not to incl y4 stuff to be fair to jaes but i can still try to submit and see if the comm approves or not. so what do you guys think?,btohqsg
why need to be fair to JAE,btohqsg
i mean is the sch policy üòÖ ill submit it and see if they accept or not ah,btohqsg
you lose nothing by trying to submit it,btohqsg
even if it‚Äôs not in your sgc  unis apps will still have place to mention that sort of thing,btohqsg
SGC don't hold much water imo,btohqsg

One of my friend is also working on an OS that is better than Windows 11 but uses Windows 11 framework,btohqsg
So win app can run uh,btohqsg
Because of cost reason   when my friend build a PC he don't use Windows as base OS   he turned to Linux instead as it is free of charge (I.e. can ask extra support/training for money),btohqsg
Saving him 170 sgd üòÖüòÖ but he is willing to learn,btohqsg
People either use alternative OS or pirate windows,btohqsg
Actually I think can get Windows for free if you student in sec sch   Poly or jc,btohqsg
Or if you have money   buy Apple Macbooks,btohqsg
Many years ago  when I was studying computer science during free time   I came across a Microsoft program that let ppl download Windows Server for free with legit key included,btohqsg
For students so I signed up,btohqsg
Back then it was called dreamspark,btohqsg
I apparently sign up using school email üòÖüòÖ and download Windows Server 2008 right away and was able to configure it to look like desktop version of Windows,btohqsg
Coaxing my computer to work with a server os made me interested in IT course later on which I got in uh,btohqsg
Paradigm Mall Johor Bahru has expressed its sorrow for an incident that occurred on 19 Jan 2025. There is reportedly a suicide in the ladies‚Äô toilet on Level 4 of the mall.,btohqsg
you know a Windows License on Shopee Malaysia only costs less than RM 10 lol.,btohqsg
Grey market Windows License. But good to use.,btohqsg
rip. tbh  Paradigm Mall JB is kinda shit.,btohqsg
yeahhh apparently is somewhat legit license  most likely is overpurchased by some IT guy  and resold outside.,btohqsg
My school provided it for free,btohqsg
I practically had license keys for anything microsoft,btohqsg
So I should tell him go Malaysia buy windows key uh üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
If he needs it or sth in future,btohqsg
I mean you just need to change country from the app from Singapore to Malaysia I guess?,btohqsg
then register another account if I recalled correctly,btohqsg
taobao windows cost less than RMB10,btohqsg
to switch your location on apps  u have to change ur google's main location,btohqsg
install windows using microsoft's official ISO first,btohqsg
the one on the play store has an english feature,btohqsg
then activate using the code u bought off taobao,btohqsg
and google translate (in-app translation) works for taobao,btohqsg
for legal reasons I have never did this before,btohqsg
Some ppl call this grey license key indeed,btohqsg
Many years ago   there were crackdown on piracy in China by Microsoft,btohqsg
u need to know how to use them,btohqsg
and u can't just find any cheap product online blindly,btohqsg
Nowadays they dc liao I guess,btohqsg
just read the reviews  it just few dollars  < 1/20 of the price of the original license.,btohqsg
i hv heard ppl ending up with broken pcs after trying to self-install OS,btohqsg
I mean   they can still earn $ from Microsoft 365 subscriptions licences,btohqsg
sorry but i don't trust reviews,btohqsg
either there's failing hardware  or a corrupt Pendrive lol.,btohqsg
Windows 11 can be downloaded officially from Microsoft.,btohqsg
a lot of reviews also come without any sustainable reasoning,btohqsg
usually they just want to grind free coins / beans,btohqsg
most of the time you install a new OS  typically is for a new PC system.,btohqsg
if you install on old hardware  just check the Windows compatibility.Hardly comes up with any issues 90% of the time.,btohqsg
old hardware might not play nice with win11 tho,btohqsg
Ohh yeah I tried installing Linux on very old hardware too üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I doubt anyone would be running Windows 11 on 1st/2nd Gen Intel CPU.,btohqsg
i know but if someone just wants to try out after building / testing the hardwareone small mistake with OS installation can fuck up the other features,btohqsg
and usually when that happens  the computers tend to have weak connectivity,btohqsg
even if there's a server room nearby,btohqsg
no wonder every 2-3 years all the computers change,btohqsg
Seems that Microsoft accepted the fate that piracy not ending,btohqsg
Some China user and ppl reported seeing black screen and nagging them to activate XP with legit key,btohqsg
tbf china ppl are tech savvy as fuck with all the vpn restrictions,btohqsg
for someone to state this  I believe they are from born before 2008.ü§£,btohqsg
i can't believe windows xp was before 2010s,btohqsg

They typically sign up for security update plan for enterprise,btohqsg
the younger employees bring their own laptops to work,btohqsg
a very small 20+ years old  private listed enterprise,btohqsg
Wait till you see some industrial machinery use Windows XP embedded üòÖüòÖ they don't connect it to Internet,btohqsg
if they wanted to stop it they probably could,btohqsg
ppl use windows for free more likely they will buy stuff like m365  xbox game pass  etcetc  rather than they full on switch to apple,btohqsg
ppl used to windows  they won't want to switch,btohqsg
Another product that exploit user knowledge is duolingo,btohqsg
My brain rot is insane after a level,btohqsg
I used it to learn languages too haha and the memes are free marketing for the app development ppl,btohqsg

I was in reddit r/sgexams and I said this before uh,btohqsg
In Poly  students can choose to suffer,btohqsg
In JC   all students suffer together,btohqsg
I mean u still can choose to lepak,btohqsg
üòÖ kinda true to an extent   Poly allows academically inclined students to get extra mods for extra points,btohqsg
But not the case in JC given the workload   they treat all students as academic inclined by definition or by default,btohqsg
i think its reasonableyou need to mug hard enough to enter jc,btohqsg
yup considering whether to apply fr plp,btohqsg
"""All students suffer together"" is disagreeable",btohqsg
