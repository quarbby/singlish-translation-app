Exploding cars because your mechanic sucks bro time to changed your workshop 😝😝😝😝😝😝 Subaru is only when you have tons of cash to buy all those dope parts from stocklist in Japan 😝😝😝😝,btohqsg
bro i paid $500 for an oil change  to some here  expensive means better!,btohqsg
oil and water seperation was paid for too😈😈,btohqsg
Siao $500 for oil change I rather top up a $100 can do major servicing liao haha,btohqsg
HAHA hannor but some people pay $500 for 2L oil change,btohqsg
Wah that is a rip off bro  $500 can service a 5 litre oil change at most of the other workshop man 😝😝🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
things that cannot be earned via petrol tax  they will find other ways to earn it.,btohqsg
Even for the entry Kona wth man,btohqsg
It’s like 0% NCD kind of price,btohqsg
Wonder why the insurance premiums are so high for EVs 🤔 insurers must feel a higher risk insuring EV drivers,btohqsg
It’s becoz of little understanding on the risks,btohqsg
Hence insurers tend to be a bit conservative I suppose,btohqsg
ya road tax and insurance higher then ferrari lol,btohqsg
and it is just a m3p not even a model s,btohqsg
Btw  what does it mean by Referral Model,btohqsg
this is long story  allianz will not quote u till u join tesla club  that is run by some 1 not from tesla  and they will only quote u when u join and pay like $60 i think,btohqsg
we waiting for elon musk to sell us tesla insurance,btohqsg
then these insurance company can all go sleep,btohqsg
Pay 60k for the insurance or for the membership,btohqsg
Sticking to petrol until they made EV more affordable .. lol,btohqsg
derrick actually the article is misleading case that tesla he driving is a performance 1  that can drift  and got track mode  and 506 horse power lol,btohqsg
no those normal bread and butter ev,btohqsg
I think there’s some here who joined TLKP right  the leader Raymond Lay got some lobang.,btohqsg
it is like bmw m series,btohqsg
Can quote around 1.8k. More reasonable,btohqsg
different haah it a long story,btohqsg
1.8k is standard  performance 1 should be 2 k plus,btohqsg
Standard range is it good enough btw,btohqsg
performance buyer is looking at the spec,btohqsg
standard range is a a to b car,btohqsg
Probably changing car next year .. Still thinking between EV and Petrol .. Looking at the limited infrastructure and hidden cost  i am still of the opinion of petrol car. Maybe 5 more years then change to EV car.,btohqsg
u should go test drive first,btohqsg
Performance buyer will look at model S liao,btohqsg
model s dont have in singapore  and it is easily 500k,btohqsg
What is petrol cost? Enjoy ICE while it lasts  or spend more get audi Etron,btohqsg
we also waiting for model s  around 2 years plus wil land in our shore due to over demand,btohqsg
So literally just keep driving ICE until govt puts in a better framework for people to adopt,btohqsg
Actually 2040 the Govt still allows hybrids. They just going to remove all pure ICEs. So. There is still some hope for petrol cars in some sense.,btohqsg
Price doenst even sound like A-B. Sed,btohqsg
And if u think m3p not a performance car I don’t know what car u are driving lioa haha,btohqsg
6-7k each year on tax and insurance  not to mention the crazy COE and price..  for the same kind of investment can buy most mid range sports cars,btohqsg
Anyway performance or not is hardly the issue. Unless staying in landed  i won't even consider buying EV. Or unless my company cp got dedicated lot for charging,btohqsg
okay we are back to a circular argument  what defines a performance car,btohqsg
Actually EVs are affordable what. Compare a model 3 to a 3 series or c class. Compare a mg zs EV to a Yaris cross hybrid?,btohqsg
China leading the world in renewable energy generation and EVs. Whatever you may think of China  this is simply a fact.,btohqsg
Erm… most premium engine oil I’ve seen is at most $50-55 per L and that is already very high but I get it for that product.,btohqsg
it is. fast acceleration. why is it not?,btohqsg
Recently went shopping for HRV and HRV hybrid ... The price difference is one  .. For pure EV car  limited infrastructure is one big concern. I am starting to see charging queue at my area's petrol station.,btohqsg
does it handle well? if it doesnt  is it still a performance car?,btohqsg
should a performance car be an all rounder?,btohqsg
