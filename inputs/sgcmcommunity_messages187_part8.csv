If not you wait till 30s then get a car .,btohqsg
That wouldn't matter then if you have driving experience for 15 years on your license,btohqsg
You probably fit the higher age clause as well of over 27,btohqsg
In a cat A Conti or jap car,btohqsg
Cheapest excess among the cars I own,btohqsg
But that 1 I hardly drive . FIL pops over then I drive him around .,btohqsg
Wow I suspect you might need to rework your policy terms  seems too high even for a mid engined car at your age,btohqsg
The insurance parked under my FIL & I am named as 2nd driver,btohqsg
Actually is tag to car and owner or Policyholder dunno which  cos I got a car under my name but my dad is driving  to lower insurance costs and the ncd is 50  then I had wanted to get another car under my name but the insurer say will start from 0%. I.e. iirc ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
Is how the game that been play . Suffer 1 time expensive premium which most need to go through at young age .,btohqsg
"So if i transfer ""my dad's car's"" ncd to my own  the insurance for ""his car"" would be 0 ncd",btohqsg
Tag to car owner for each particular car. NCD can be transferred to new car when changing car but not for 2nd car,btohqsg
But cannot transfer to another person,btohqsg
So if you premium kanasai can pay $25 transfer car ownership to wife and let her take insurance and top-up for any driver,btohqsg
Ah that makes more sense then,btohqsg
It's tagged to owner but is limited to one car  for a second car you need to build ncd again,btohqsg
Then add 1 ownership count and price drop moreðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Most of my car insured will have named driver . Cheaper this way .,btohqsg
However ncd from one car can transfer to another using the ncd protector,btohqsg
But will only stay on one of them,btohqsg
22k insurance ah ðŸ˜± I'm so sua ku ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
Or 2nd driver put abv 40s then can drive . Calling for valet will need to inform this as well,btohqsg
Pay excess only when you crash or kena,btohqsg
Well some people are fortunate to have loaded in laws  most of us are fortunate enough to own 1 beat up shitbox,btohqsg
But nobody else can drive except you and policy holder,btohqsg
You can always have a choice to find . That what my brother told me when I was in JC .,btohqsg
Probably something mid engined and relatively fast,btohqsg
Valet is company insurance no? They have special coverage,btohqsg
No  not that  but because of the clause in your insurance,btohqsg
Most of them ride on your insurance under unnamed driver clause and their company insurance will just cover the excess should anything happen,btohqsg
So those shady valet actually quite risky,btohqsg
Then to be safe dun ever let anyone drive your car lolz,btohqsg
A clause in the  car insurance which needs to be followed,btohqsg
And parking valet is no insurance,btohqsg
Sometimes when you touch a bit of alcohol .,btohqsg
Yah you better confirm this driver  part,btohqsg
Usually I just left the car there and next day then go retrieve,btohqsg
Else any damage is pay out of own pocket,btohqsg
That's why you might see some full loaner supercar owners parking outside mbs and sleeping in the car,btohqsg
Because they do not wish to pay for the excess or take the risk of letting a valet drive,btohqsg
But must not sit behind wheel,btohqsg
There is a way to make this more convenient by adding unnamed driver clause but your premium gao gao,btohqsg
You're in a carpark in your own car.,btohqsg
But police can catch you even if the car is not moving,btohqsg
urs is anything but a shitbox,btohqsg
The only painful issues for car insurance is - expensive while you are young,btohqsg
Not if you can prove you weren't moving off by way of showing how long the car was parked.,btohqsg
To be caught under drunk driving you need to be operating the car not seated in it,btohqsg
Or have the intention to operate while being under the influence,btohqsg
Lol aiyah just sit pax side and avoid all the hassle,btohqsg
