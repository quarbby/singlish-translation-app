Ma'am what's the best trust cashback category to choose to optimize for overseas spend?,btohqsg
i'm choosing Dining because:1. Japan konbini is 54992. Amaze + UOB Lady dead. I need an alternative,btohqsg
I'm thinking of applying next month so my quarter will be calendar quarter,btohqsg
my thinking more FOMOthe earlier u apply  the faster you start getting 15% on Dining (4.9% blended),btohqsg
Amaze + lady can still hold on for this month üòî. Calendar quarter is easier for my small brain to track.,btohqsg

Hi guys  not sure anyone already know and just to shared here to benefits everyone. If your use UOB PPV to top up your Starbucks wallet you will earn the bonus miles in block of $5 since starbucks only allow to top up $10/$20/$50.
