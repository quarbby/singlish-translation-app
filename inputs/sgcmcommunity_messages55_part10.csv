What‚Äôs a good mileage to look at buying a 2019 reg car,btohqsg
unless they got servicing records from Ad,btohqsg
Nowadays learner cars using Nissan note e-power and Kona EV,btohqsg
Indeed  all the seating positions in used cars are tempered with.,btohqsg
But set a higher limit of 50 to 60k maybe,btohqsg
And it is easy to figure out if the mileage has been tampered with and it also depends on the car model,btohqsg
Some are very hard to tamper,btohqsg
And doing a PPI is important for that purpose because if anything has been done,btohqsg
It will always show up in the logs,btohqsg
Hmmm I guess will need to try out,btohqsg
More comfortable to drive.Compare to DCT. Alot of gear changing. Jerky,btohqsg
Dct good for performance oriented cars,btohqsg
Which is Porsche's version of a dct,btohqsg
That also depends on how they were used,btohqsg
A lot of golfs tuned horribly,btohqsg
What‚Äôs a good first car to suggest  for far distance travel  back and forth  and also wanna use the car to earn some money to do hitch or parcel delivery,btohqsg
For the daily drive CVT is pretty smooth and decent,btohqsg
I have Kia sonet  avante  and venue to consider now  any others?,btohqsg
But you will find features missing,btohqsg
And might feel that the interiors are dated if that is something you care for,btohqsg
Are you looking at new or used?,btohqsg
And what is your budget/key requirements,btohqsg
Hmmm I would say less than 120k? Value of car lesser than 120k  just wanna have a feel of being a car owner also  to see whether can I manage it before jumping into slightly higher end cars or even continental cars. But for sure that will be on a long run,btohqsg
I will be using it a lot for traveling  firstly is to send my fianc√© to work  then I go work  north to east  then maybe fee time can do some hitch to earn some extra income to cover the cost of a car,btohqsg
Any rough depre that you are looking at?,btohqsg
Because 120k for 1 year left and 9 years left can be different,btohqsg
Wouldn‚Äôt wanna spend too much on a monthly basis  at least 1.5k including petrol and parking?,btohqsg
Petrol will be variable based on your running which seems to be on the higher side,btohqsg
Around 12k range per year bah  since now coe is expensive,btohqsg
Best is 5 years or more left,btohqsg
I would say right now is the worst time to jump in as the market is not a buyers' market at all,btohqsg
Your best options are probably 2017 to 2019 Corolla Altis  Kia Cerato  Mazda 3 and Hyundai Elantra/avante,btohqsg
As they offer lower maintenance cost  tend to be reliable with longer major service intervals  decent fuel efficiency and there's enough on the market to consider so you can find the right unit at the right price,btohqsg
But definitely look into maintanence and petrol for your budget,btohqsg
And work out a more exact figure to see if you are comfortable with it or not,btohqsg
Best not to push yourself and get something to jump into the world of car ownership then regret it due to mounting bills,btohqsg
Probably avoid cars like the wish  vezel  Prius because many do have issues with maintanence and mileage tampering because of use as PHV,btohqsg
Also since you are getting a used car,btohqsg
Budget maybe 5% of the car's price for wear and tear,btohqsg
That you might have to do up in the near future,btohqsg
wow you really want that prize eh arnav haha,btohqsg
