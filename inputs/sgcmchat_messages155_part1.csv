U gotta see which year has the most registration of car,btohqsg
I hear people saying oh the price will drop and im like ok if it drops to just 100k are you buying?,btohqsg
For example if 2014 has most registration of cars the likelihood of renew coe would be 80% and coe will peak in 2024,btohqsg
80% maybe 65% renew 10y rest renew 5y,btohqsg
There are few examples also why coe peak cuz some car registerd in 2014 or 2015 but owner left maybe 2 or 1y left straight go renew hence jacking up the quota,btohqsg
Cuz now coe peak can mark up alot,btohqsg
They should have made a special cat for sport vehicles only,btohqsg
From there u see every rather buy sports car then normal car,btohqsg
Cuz more then 50% are just normal daily car that renew coe,btohqsg
At this point I rather buy a GR yaris which in long term would be great,btohqsg
