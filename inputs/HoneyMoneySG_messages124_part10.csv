For SCB journey card  does it accumulate miles with medical bills?,btohqsg
Hello! Im trying to pay a window grille company via their online payment link. Does DBS woman card exclude this category? :/,btohqsg
i know this is late and irrelevant but you can consider Stan Chart Smart card for transportation as it gives 6.8% cash back on transportation and fast food dinning and also subscriptions to netflix and all,btohqsg
What type of medical bills? Clinic or hospital?,btohqsg
can anyone confirm if buying from samsung online store is mcc 5732? want to use hsbc revo card for purchase,btohqsg
depends on the mcc  test mcc via locked dbs card and check via dbs digibot,btohqsg
scb tnc doesn't seem to exclude hospital. I don't have it myself so others can advise.,btohqsg
yes  so long not excluded mcc e.g. govt services,btohqsg
Outpatient bills from NUH and dental bills from national dental center Singapore,btohqsg
If you search in chat history  there are suggestions to pay through health hub,btohqsg
Yes  I am paying health hub.,btohqsg
Actually it is health buddy app. I presume they are the same,btohqsg
same mcc 8099. In fact can get 4mpd on dbs wwmc and citi rewards.,btohqsg
Same same but different. Usually those apps are for 4mpd cards to earn points. Ur scb journey is ok to use for those platforms as well.,btohqsg
Hi. After EGA this mth  may i know the recommendations to transfer my EGA funds for better rates?,btohqsg
Hi  i need to cash out some amount from my OA to repay my HDB unit loan from bank  as  repricing interest is high. If I cash from OA how much interest I will be loosing?,btohqsg
If you utilise OA  you will lose 2.5% p.a.If you reduce your HDB loan  you will save 2.6% p.a.If you are still on HDB Loan  i would advise you NOT to reduce it.The right strategy in my opinion (since HDB loan has no lock in no early repayment penalty) is to use CPF OA to invest in 6 month Tbills as long as 6 month Tbills pay above 3% p.a.,btohqsg
what's the repricing interest you're given?,btohqsg
he's probably on a bank loan cause HDB no need to reprice one,btohqsg
lol better not confuse terminology can be very expensive to mix up!,btohqsg
Right i have edited my message üòÄ,btohqsg
Bank loan for HDB unit  now hard to predict la.But generally speaking if the rate is 3.643%  and your CPF OA is only earning 2.5% p.a.  it might make sense to reduce your Bank loan for HDB unit when you do the refinancing.Loan Rate are EXPECTED (not guaranteed) to come down over the next 1-2 years as US side gradually lowers interest rates. So it might not be advisable to lock in any long term Bank Loans for property.,btohqsg
SG Banks are a bit decoupled from US side for unknown reasons..just when you are expecting interest rates to come down (yes  they have been cutting SAVINGS RATES) SG Banks have been RAISING loan rates like Property Loans and Balance Transfers..no one monitoring and slapping them,btohqsg
no but even 3.6% is crazy,btohqsg
the market rates going for about 2.8 to 3.1% max now,btohqsg
these could have long lock ins / minimum sizes,btohqsg
Is there anyone using Maybank2U SG Lite on Android phone? I installed it and cannot launch it. open & crash. open & crash,btohqsg
Thanks. It works now after reinstalling 2 times. üòÅ,btohqsg
Sgh bills using uob ladys card  counted as 500 dollars spending for UOB 1 bonus interest ? Anyone knows ?,btohqsg
Hi guys! I am at Australia now.. renting a campervan. They asked for 5k AUD deposit. Can I ask if it is better to use card like Youtrip card or better to use bank card like OCBC? Cos I bought my OCBC card just in case.,btohqsg
Deposit use bank card  it is a temp hold on credit. Debit card like youtrip usually have issue,btohqsg
The bank fx spread of 3%+ also will get refunded?,btohqsg
Avoid prepaid cards like Youtrip  Revolut  Amaze for such deposits,btohqsg
It is a different deduct mechanism for cc deposit hold and debit card/prepaid card deposit hold  always use credit card for deposit hold,btohqsg
"While I generally discourage Just In Time warriors  I have decided to do a last minute earmark for another Human as the 5.76% p.a. for 5 months lockin (if 31st July is successfully accepted) is too attractive not to do more.""150kNationofSaverPromo"" comment is within the 25 character limit.So basically move in SGD150k today. NEVER TOUCH THE AMOUNT until 17th December 2024.In the meantime  all I would transfer out is just the monthly One Account Bonus Interest.I'm keeping the UOB One Account Balance at SGD151 050 (my June MAB is $1001). Don't ask me why +50 and not +1 +2 +3 +4. I just like some buffer.",btohqsg
Anyone can scan using xnap? I scan internal error,btohqsg
XNAP is gone till further notice,btohqsg
Just open OCBC360 a few days after 1st July. Deposit  salary credit done when does interest credit?,btohqsg
Do you xfer out the balance once the earmark is done?,btohqsg
For habc ega new promo  usually when they announce ? 1 day of the month ?,btohqsg
So basically move in SGD150k today. NEVER TOUCH THE AMOUNT until 17th December 2024.In the meantime  all I would transfer out is just the monthly One Account Bonus Interest.,btohqsg
How about this scenario wrt UOB One PromoJune MAB $60 050 of which 50k is earmarked & scheduled for release Aug 24.31 Jul - Deposit 150K for Nation of SaversDoes one need to keep $210 050 till 17 Dec 2024? Or can withdraw 10k on 1 Aug and then another 50k when earmark is released?,btohqsg
Almost got bitten for being JIT warrior. Got blocked by CIMB for making a transfer request and it took about 15 minutes for them to do a Phone Call before they released the transaction.Warning to those JIT warrior who like to do 10pm transfers.,btohqsg
my opinion is that you would be disqualifiedTNC = need to keep (June MAB + earmark amount) for entire promo period,btohqsg
12am or morning of the 1st itself,btohqsg
Next month  around 7thworkingday your bonus interest will be credited.,btohqsg
