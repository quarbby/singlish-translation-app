There are vids on med school interviews,btohqsg
I think they can ask about informed consent,btohqsg
Abortion differs from state to state,btohqsg
Hard questions are the ones worth answering,btohqsg
a trigger question is very good at weeding out undesirables,btohqsg
they just want to see how u answer it,btohqsg
Then make judgement as to when the fetus is considered a life,btohqsg
Speaking of interviews what was your Cambridge interview like?,btohqsg
No probe about why cam why major,btohqsg
You mean they give you a problem and you try to solve it?,btohqsg
Personally i would regard it as would the fetus have a good quality of life,btohqsg
There's a separate entrance exam tho,btohqsg
Maybe they looking at how efficient your work is under pressure,btohqsg
I’d look at the long-term consequences for my patient in general,btohqsg
How is it compared to step,btohqsg

Assuming the mother has lower chances of survival due to blood loss  I would save the fetus,btohqsg
Say I assume that mother decision is more important and that baby cannot choose his life status,btohqsg
Hence given the circumstances I would choose xxx,btohqsg
Ya la just list out assumption,btohqsg
Assuming the baby would not likely survive even if we tried to save it  then i’d save the mother,btohqsg
Well that’s an easy way out,btohqsg
No shit if the baby doesn’t survive you wouldn’t try to save it,btohqsg
