It is not much but don't u think morally it is not right that the bank don't inform depositor that by putting more fund in that particular acc don't earn interest or less interest than they would get if fund r kept in other acc. The amt is negligible.  I am sharing my experience cos I transfer fund to my mca acc n have 2800 n my saving acc have 1000. My saving acc have 4cts credited n my mca acc despite having much more do not rec any Interest at all,btohqsg
