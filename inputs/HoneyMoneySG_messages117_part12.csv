Free Limo is not so important to me perhaps. About $16 per trip. Total about $64 only.,btohqsg
my cab ride to airport is 25-30 leh üôÅ,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony!So if I already have my CL increase approved last month (with the limit I set)  there‚Äôs no harm to apply for another CL increase this month and let the bank decide CL for me  is this correct?,btohqsg
I see. I just compared between the rights card,btohqsg
i just reread your original message. I think can leave ur dbs limit for now as you just changed it so recent.,btohqsg
How do u get $16? I think each time I call a grab  it needs at least $20,btohqsg
I think 1 guess free is important. Some restaurants are quite expensive. You need credits from two passes ($67) for 1 person meal.,btohqsg
Usually I will go early n lounge hopping. I  choose off peak to go airport. many hours early. Avoid peak.,btohqsg
Oh  i reliesed that hscb just have 1 person free for lounge  right?,btohqsg
Even after 12am?And normal taxi can fit 3-4 luggages?,btohqsg
I seldom take flight after 12am. Usually I one person take flight. But for restaurants  I need two passes $67 for 1 person meal.,btohqsg
What restanurant needs two passes for 1 person?,btohqsg
U can check price listed in Wolfgang,btohqsg
Hi guys can I check  does the citirewards cc  1k limit bonus points resets on every 1st of the month?,btohqsg
No. Will reset on your each statement day,btohqsg
Ah I see. Thank you! üòä,btohqsg
Own self pay don‚Äôt go.Unlimited pp. go.,btohqsg
I like the satay.üòã better than ASK.,btohqsg
Must try next time. Thanks for your recommendation!!!,btohqsg
Got it  will leave it for now thenWorried this might trigger DBS to reduce my CL lol,btohqsg
Satay at Wolfgang better? Have not tried this yet lol,btohqsg
dont worry. dbs was my first cc and got some low limits. I applied for a lot more ccs from various banks and not once DBS touched my credit limits.,btohqsg
I mean comparing between ASK n WG.,btohqsg
Thanks again for the info :)I‚Äôll wait it out and try apply for CL increase towards the end of the year,btohqsg
Got it :)will try it the next time I‚Äôm at the airport lol,btohqsg
Guys  DBS altitude card is it good for miles? Otherwise  what other advantages do they have?,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best card for both miles and cash back,btohqsg
Be decisice and choose one side üòÇ,btohqsg
Cuz I have big ticket expense incoming  so if it‚Äôs for cash back  what will be the recommendation?,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/GJeZ7VEwAcYCashback and big ticket is Citi smrt but gotta see if it fits you.,btohqsg
Problem is I only have account with DBS,btohqsg
Just went to UOB today and they rejected my application for the credit card cuz I do not have any transaction records with them.,btohqsg
I don't see how it stops u from applying for Citi smrt. Unless you applied and got rejected before.,btohqsg
Can someone advise if I used Amaze+UOB Lady's to book hotel thru Agoda  money already deducted. However few days later  I cancel the booking  the money will refund to my UOB Lady's?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm new to HSBC so pls help out! how do i check my outstanding amount due  statement balance and payment due date? Unlike UOB and DBS app which will directly show  i find HSBC doesn‚Äôt?? Do hsbc users check it from their estatments only? Thanks!!,btohqsg
for amaze card  i‚Äôve applied for it on 19Jun but has not been processed yet.. anyone have any idea roughly how long it takes?? thanks!,btohqsg
how much is the big ticket item? paying online/offline? which mcc/merchant?,btohqsg
Using the app at your credit card page  belowView StatementsBalance TransferView MoreThere's a short horizontal grey bar. Pull that down to reveal all the info you need.,btohqsg
omg thanks it‚Äôs helpful didn‚Äôt know that existed!! may i also ask why is it that i paid my CC bill and then the next day the transaction is gone?? sorry for asking a basic qn cuz hsbc app looks sooo diff from the other banks apps.. how do i check that my cc bill has been paid?,btohqsg
Depend on where you stay. Maybe stay at Pasir Ris less than $15.,btohqsg
I use amaze+citireward to pay for NordVPN but I not happy with it and ask for refunds. It refund to the Amaze wallet only and not to the credit card.,btohqsg
Cc is slower by few days from what I experience paying amaze+crmc,btohqsg
I don't know if we are using the same app or looking at the same page... I can scroll thru past cc transactions up till Mar 2023.,btohqsg
They changed it? I have gotten refunds from amaze and it always go to the credit card even if i put wallet as link type when the refund is processing  it go back to the original payment method last timeSo like that if wan to top up wallet with cc can jus buy somethting on lazada or shopee and cancel immediately?,btohqsg
Did you paid using amaze linked to credit card  but changed to wallet and then request for refund? If yes  this is potentially a loophole. LolBut then... I don't see much use case or potential of abuse for this cos we can easily top up w/o fees using bank transfer.,btohqsg
Based on multiple data points  refunds have been and will always go back to wallet. But what's the point of doing that? It's additional effort and the FX spread is higher for linked card.,btohqsg
Hi  I am setting up giro for HSBC EGA. Can I pay my wife's credit card bills via giro? Or does it need to be the same name then can?,btohqsg
i spend sgd and refund sgd then no fx spread? i usually top up my wallet around 200 a month for spend in malaysia and if i can pay the 200 later during cc bill vs immediately via paynow or bank transfer of course paying later is better,btohqsg
Hi. May I check for clocking EVOL's contactless payment  is buying Fairprice/Fraser voucher over the counter considered?,btohqsg
Mine has always been to cc,btohqsg
