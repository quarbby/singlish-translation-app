25k put 3mths FD also earn,btohqsg
Depends on the model? Sedan?13k seems quite ok. Can request to do a workshop check prior purchasing. 1.5yrs means u can keep trying new car,btohqsg
Yah save 2 rounds can put deposit for new car le,btohqsg
If I salesman I will tell u Don’t ask how much. Ask how much youth u left with,btohqsg
Still too long. Buy 1 left with less than 6 mths,btohqsg
The shorter coe left the better. Assuming mkt depre or less,btohqsg
The shorter the coe  the more u will utilise ur car . So actually the money u paid is more worth it,btohqsg

Depending on what is the purpose of buying. If theres a good usage then its fine to me. I also bought a car last year for my new born. The convenience is really what matters. Also grab family don provide car seats,btohqsg
Safety  comfort  cleaniness  convenience  time vs car cost (instalment  car park  road tax insurance etc),btohqsg
If u r lancer driver  what will u do to escape?,btohqsg
Why need escape if u nvr do illegal things in the first place,btohqsg
It’s like playing one player hide and seek.,btohqsg
if i grab to and fro work everyday  its abt $100 daily,btohqsg
just buy a jazz or a economical japanese car to tide your through this 2 years. maintenance and everything is much cheaper too,btohqsg
My 1 way abt 100 liao LOL,btohqsg
so much more flexibility with a car,btohqsg
I do think its worth to buy a car if ur usage makes up for it,btohqsg
I'm looking at 2nd hand Nissan X-trail  7 seater. I need a car as I have new born twins  need to send them to infant care school everyday. Have also survey few 7 seater model like Toyota sienta & BMW 216i gran tourer  but both model have almost equal and more depreciation than Nissan X-trail. The downside for Nissan X-trail is have less coe left and smaller 3rd row seat.,btohqsg
How in the world does it goUp to 100 bucks for one trip,btohqsg
I charge u $70 plus buy u kopi n bf,btohqsg
U can eat in the car nvm,btohqsg
I can drive 2 trips lesser,btohqsg
ImGenuinely curious how one trip goUp 100 bucks,btohqsg
Yes. Coz just grab i wont be able to get car at my area,btohqsg
Consignment unit  do take note on the car condition and nitpick on it  usually can shave off some of the cost.,btohqsg
Can wait very very long no car during peak hours...,btohqsg
Dont get continental if price is a big factor in your car decision making.,btohqsg
Guys  put it in this situation  if u have new borns like me  and always need to send them to infant care  and so always need to go hospital clinic for appointment.. Do u think it is worth to own this parf car (7 seater) for 1yr 6month then in the end scrap? And then hopefully nxt 2 Yr coe trend become lower and find again next 7 seater parf car.,btohqsg
Considered the Outlander? Also 7 seater. Sat in it once and looks surprisingly spacious,btohqsg
Ya.. That's why now target on this Nissan x-trail  as Japanese car more safe to maintain,btohqsg
Owning one is always more expensive than taking grab / taxi  but it will be more convenient.  You can try to own for 1-2 years and see how it impacted your finance  lease also possible for these period.,btohqsg
But mitsubishi outlander is 2.4cc  worry on the fuel consumption. And so far I don't see any low mileage outlander.,btohqsg
Can buy 28 days later? So dealer pay the road tax 4 u,btohqsg
Actually xtrail 6th n 7th seat is very small,btohqsg
Disadvantage of taxi or grab is always need setup baby car seat and take time to call taxi/grab. Especially calling taxi/grab at KK hospital sometimes really make me n my wife crazy.,btohqsg
Condition seems good if mileage is true,btohqsg
Ya 7 seat suv r like that. Even x5 n q7 same,btohqsg
Book grab premium 6. Even if driver is at Tuas  he will magically appear in ur location in 5 mins,btohqsg
Then go for it  just take note on the cost.,btohqsg
Diesel abit more requirement to take care la. Im driving a petrol mpv. So far so good,btohqsg
U will feel heavenly if u pump diesel in jb,btohqsg
Trying to find lowest depreciation parf car with 7 seater. So far many mpv only Toyota sienta is the lowest but cat A and I had drive fews time Getgo Toyota sienta  actually plastic feel and less premium if compare with Nissan X-trail,btohqsg
Not dare to try Diesel mpv like Renault grand scenic or citroen. I'm not familiar with diesel car,btohqsg
Sienta is the cheapest mpv in market. No choice. If u can find citroen petrol can consider. But depre also very high now also,btohqsg
Im on petrol citroen. I find renault have 1 of the most posh interior among mpv. Even better than noah,btohqsg
My fren used rgs to do phv for 1 year 100k km np,btohqsg
Conti mpv always better interior/exterior than jap or kr,btohqsg
Main problem with rgs is the aircon. And if wanna buy 2nd hand rgs abit hard to find non phv,btohqsg
Nowdays any bread and butter car also got phv use,btohqsg
