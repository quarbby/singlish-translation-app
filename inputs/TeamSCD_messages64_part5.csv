Really Ma. Fit is modifiable jazz is the must follow rule and difficult to Zhng one,btohqsg
max pressure usually 50psi. that's too near max already 😵,btohqsg
You that you reminded me that car can be a claymore anytime,btohqsg
No la tyres burst at ard 200psi mah,btohqsg
Paiseh I MC HAHA just woke up,btohqsg
Cannot find hole tbh can be a lot of things  like some shifu say can be valve  or can be things like the side of the tyre bead have small air leakage,btohqsg
Actually this one for normal compressed air on the high side sia HAHA,btohqsg
Wider tyres (I.e. u upgrade width only 225-> 235 etc) u don’t need to pump until so hard  it’s mostly when you upgrade rims for example 19inch -> 21inch & ur tyre profile becomes v thin then it’s necessary,btohqsg
If u want to ownself DIY check leak  can get those spray bottle fill with soapy water,btohqsg
Then u spray the valve check if got bubbles,btohqsg
Next step if all fails is the shop will dump ur entire tyre + rim in water liao,btohqsg
his car like every other day got something come up,btohqsg
And cfm at 170 the compressed air gna expand like nobody bizniz,btohqsg
i 36psi already feel too hard,btohqsg
