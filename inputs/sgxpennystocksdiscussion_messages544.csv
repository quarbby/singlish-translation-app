üöÄPika World Update- Oct 1  2021üöÄüößA Turbulent SeptemberSeptember indeed came in line with expectations as a poor season for the equity market. Major indexes retreated despite been green in the early session. This marked one of the worst September for critical indexes such as the S&P 500 and Dow.Despite Congress passing a stopgap funding bill to keep the government open till Dec 3  uncertainty continued to roll in the market. Moreover  the worries of weakening corporate profits in the coming quarters and the persistent awakening of rising bond yields unsettle investors when the time has arrived for the Fed to begin tapering.Pika World sees this confluence of factors as a headwind to the stock market with the wildcard- Covid still in play.üíµInflation runs Hot in EuropeEconomic health is getting better in the UK. However  on the backdrop is fierce Inflation in the eurozone area that is hitting a 10-year high. As a result  the Bank of England and the European Central Bank is pushing ahead with the tapering.The UK GDP jumped by 5.5% for the quarter ended in June  an upward revision from the 4.8% estimate. A key takeaway is that the BOE Governor had hinted that there is a strong consensus among the body members to raise the rate soon to tackle the hot Inflation.France is also experiencing high Inflation  which sees at 2.7% on an annual basis. Likewise  Germany's Bundesbank had also indicated that Inflation is likely to stay above 2% for most of 2022.With the Inflation fear narrative back on track  Pika World focuses strongly on the sentiments of tapering among developed economies.üß®Meme Stocks; Bed Bath & Beyond TumbleIts latest reported earnings are short of analyst expectations  and it had cut guidance. This is a red light for investors despite the CEO's confidence in their multi-year transformation plan. Moreover  it is likely to pressure momentum stocks as Pika World is incrementally shifting to a more cautious stance on momentum play in a more volatile environment.üìÆWhat's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Core PCE Price Index  which is expected to remain at 3.6%.10 pm will see the release of ISM Manufacturing PMI for September. We are likely to see a reading of 59.6  comparable to the prior period.Concurrently  we will have the Michigan Consumer Sentiment  which is likely to stay at 71.0  similar to the previous reading.At 1 am  FOMC Member Harker will speak  and we are focusing on FOMC members insights on the economy's health.It is Oct 1  Friday  at 7.35 am in Singapore and 7.35 pm in New York. It is the first trading day of the new quarter. We wish all friends a restful weekend ahead and a prosperous start for the week.,btohqsg

Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel) has announced on Oct 1 the sale of a 70% stake in Australia Tower Network (ATN)  a wholly-owned subsidiary of Optus.

Optus will be the anchor tenant on 565 new build-to-suit towers to be built over the next three years which will form an integral part of its 5G network.3. Proceeds from the sale will be used to fund the rollout of 5G and other growth initiatives  including expanding the B2B digital services business in Singapore and Australia through NCS. The company also says the value unlocked through capital recycling will position the group to deliver sustainable dividends.More here,btohqsg

"Admitting inactivated virus vaccine is better than mRNA""Current vaccines teach the body to recognise the spike proteins on the surface of the virus  but that could change as the virus mutates.Getting an infection  on the other hand  teaches the body to recognise all parts of the virus  including the core that cannot change  and is thus effective against any mutation""",btohqsg
