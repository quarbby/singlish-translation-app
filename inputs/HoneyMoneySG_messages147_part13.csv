Don't see it lasting long. It's a dying art imo. Newer generations are less interested in collecting watches  eventually will fall off.,btohqsg
1. Possible as you're self employed. But do calculate as there's a max annual contribution cap. Anything more will be returnedwithout interest. Take note that the MA contribution via VC3A do not count towards your mandatory MA contribution  and you still have the option to RSTU/VCMA for $8k more tax reliefs.2. Possible. Can potentially get back the $8k after whole year.,btohqsg
Hopefully you didn't top-up too much. No tax reliefs if you're employee and not self employed. And next time do earlier  like on 30 Dec to avoid potential unexpected server downtime.,btohqsg
Can be used for certain medical expenses and insurance premiums (Integrated Shield Plan / CareShield and its Supplementary Plan).MA contributions in excess of BHS will overflow to SA or OA if SA have reached FRS.,btohqsg
Yeah I did not top up for 3 accounts. At the end i only top up SA account.,btohqsg

Hi. May I ask  2025 BHS is 75500. If my MA now is 71500  I can top up 4k  and that will tax relief next year for 4k?So when I hit BHS  monthly contribution from employer will auto be transferred to OA if my SA is at FRS?,btohqsg
Your MA portion goes to OA but your SA portion will continue in SA each month.,btohqsg
May I ask If 2024 I hit 71500 and in December government gave about 500 dollars in MA then my MA has already increased but then why did CPF deduct the interest plus the 500 dollars and transfer to SA? Cause 2025 isn‚Äôt it supposed to be new figure of 75500??,btohqsg

About the 4K VCMA pls check your employer CPF contribution date from last month. Mine happened to be 2nd or 3rd of the month hence better to top up asap if you are planning so.,btohqsg
