How to subscribe to this? I am an existing users n have participate in last year 5.8 promo. But I don't see this new 6.8 promo on the promotion page on moomoo app,btohqsg
I would say moomoo has the best offer now at 6.8% p.a. do note investment risk still applies,btohqsg
Ohh so not suppose to be from the app. But from this link?,btohqsg
I see it on my app  but for some it doesnt appear on app.,btohqsg
Got it. Hmm  should confirm with customer service after registration or we will be notify in d app that we r registered for d promo,btohqsg

Hopefully  you subscribed exact amount. If you subscribed more or less than the indicated amount  you may not get the promised rewards. Eg. $760.I subscribed $88k for 60++ days on 5.8% which is $760.During the 60 days  I received $574.77 of total revenue.After first appeal  moomoo gave me $87 cash coupon.After second appeal  moomoo gave me another $40 cash coupon.Total rewards I received is only $574.77 + $87 + $40 =$701.77for $88k of Fullerton cash fund subscriptions. Less than $760 of what moomoo promised.Currently  trying third appeal.,btohqsg
This is the one I participated.,btohqsg
In this case  is moomoo not fulfilling their obligation? Since it‚Äôs mentioned that the returns are guaranteed and ‚Äúmoomoo will make up the difference‚Äù?,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt know can appeal. I also found the interest payout below the 5.8%,btohqsg
Different promo different minimum. Pls check latest ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù.,btohqsg
I have no comments on this. Still waiting for moomoo to give me explanation why i did not receive $760 although I subscribed more than $80k for more than 60 days.,btohqsg

For application of Safra CC  u need to be a Safra member as prerequisite. As long as u remain as Safra member  no annual fee needed. Minimum spend $500,btohqsg
I believe you can't buy before pre-market hours which I suppose is 5pm sg time,btohqsg
Ty for the info. FYI  if any safra members encounter the same problem as me when applying the Safra card thru app  please check ur Safra validity. If it's less than 6 months to expiry  u will be prompted with message  unable to confirm ur Safra membership. Go and renew ur membership and application will be available.,btohqsg
"Currently membership renewal got promo  $43.60 for 3 yrs. Technically ""annual fee"" is $14.50 per year.",btohqsg
I just renewed and able to proceed with the application,btohqsg
I like this card as it's a good general spending card with $500 spend only,btohqsg

I also dunno my status. Basically I subscribed during the flash sale. But I think only transacted in January. I sold on 5th Feb and got money back already. Will I still get January distribution?,btohqsg
$720 is not addition to what u have earned from the fund.  If u earn more than $720 from ur fund  they will not give any.  That is my understanding.,btohqsg

$200 eCapitalvouchers without annual fee payment is one of the best from Amex so far right? Anyone seen cashback or rewards more than $200 without annual fee payment?,btohqsg
Yes.For my case  I only earn $500++ from the fund. Moomoo shall top the remaining to $760. Furthermore I had additional $8k subscribed to cash fund which is $8k. My return shall be more than $810 in total.,btohqsg
Kinda sad. Thought they should topup 238. Based on what you earn just with 80k.,btohqsg
I have same problem too. Fund return only 500+. No cash coupon issued for shortfall. When I make noise they claimed that they will issue a coupon manually. Received after few days but was only 21. Called to complain again and they say will get manager to call me but never received any call. Called Moomoo again today  they say will issue me another cash coupon on 200+. Not received yet. Not sure if this will happen,btohqsg
This is quite upsetting as it has taken more than 3 weeks and still not resolved.,btohqsg
Likely The manager failed in High school Mathematics. Promised guaranteed $760 return n they even don‚Äôt know that their calculation is less than $760 n only $500++. ü§Ø,btohqsg
I have some doubts over this campaign. And not sure should participate in the latest 6.8%. Unless u monitored  feel Moomoo kind of not being honest.,btohqsg
Not sure how many people out there did not check their return n if it is correct. Hope this will raise awareness.,btohqsg
I have the same experience too. Have to appeal to get back the shortfall,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know IBKR email or phone contact number? I used the following email (asiatransfers@interacticebrokers) for Webull share transfer in instruction. but seems like failed (Webull CS team shared that IBKR team didn‚Äôt received my email instruction.,btohqsg
Hi all  just watched the video on the Webull promotion for share transfer from IBKR. Any downsides/caveats I should know of  if after receiving the shares for the whole holding period  I would like to transfer it back to IBKR?,btohqsg
not all brokerages allow transfer out,btohqsg
my other brokerage is ibkr  so it should be fine. but just wondering about after if i rather not keep the shares in webull after the promotion period?,btohqsg
just looking out fo potentialr caveats or downsides,btohqsg
