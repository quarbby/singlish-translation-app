Haiyah there will always be those seeking attention by making stirring  unconventional statements or comments. Why bother üòä,btohqsg
Some focus on aesthetics. Some focus on performance. Some don‚Äôt mod their cars at all because they know next buyers won‚Äôt even care for the mods and they will likely not be able to get extra money for them. In fact when most people see modded cars they often think ‚Äúuh oh abused car + hello high wear and tear issues‚Äù,btohqsg
