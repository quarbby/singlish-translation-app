job security  smth that u think u won't mind doing even if ur passion changes,btohqsg
Well I think its jus the passion and of we are willing to work in that field that matters,btohqsg
I mean then we can earn also,btohqsg
there's no one right answer la,btohqsg
But thats what I believe only,btohqsg
your beliefs which influence your values and vice versa,btohqsg
and your knowledge and experiences influence your beliefs,btohqsg
and social factors that influence how you perceive the knowledge and experience u have,btohqsg
I appreciate everyone here for sharing their thoughts with me,btohqsg
eh I mean tbh for me I'm passionate in a lot of different things LOL,btohqsg
doesn't necessarily mean I'm good at any of them,btohqsg
if you're talking about career and what job to choose  I think a balance between passion & job security is essential lor,btohqsg
I think it's impt to be doing smth u enjoy  but at the same time it needs to be something that can tide u through rainy days,btohqsg
so you need to find a job that's a balance between the two,btohqsg
i will always advice one to really calculate down to the last dollar the most basic kind of lifestyle that they can accept,btohqsg
find out the costs of everything  housing  insurance  transport  food  activities  luxuries,btohqsg
then also find out your tahan level,btohqsg
might as well just go into accounting,btohqsg
tahan level is like  even if the job is shit  how much pay would you need to receive to be willing to endure,btohqsg
so you will have your lower limits (the amount of money you need to earn)  and the upper limits (how much shit can u endure),btohqsg
then just work within those limits lor,btohqsg
if your lower limit happens to be higher than your upper limit  then u need to do some deep introspection,btohqsg
if you happen to be the lucky few who enjoy every single part of your job scope  then you not considered working liao...,btohqsg
same here. i guess i can be very fickle because as soon as i find something i'm good at  i wanna turn it into a hustle. so what i've done is to focus on one thing to be my 'main' goal/career  and make my other interests into something from which i can profit or do on the daily  like a business,btohqsg
"Passion and pragmatism must come hand in hand. Every passion  if you willing to be open-minded  can be lucrative. As long as you don't stay egoistic about how your passion is defined.Also  passions will change  and it's ok. because what passion brings  is a high level of energy and persistence. Using that  you can develop skills and experience at much faster rate. It's possible to achieve standards in 6 months  at a level that an unpassionate person would achieve in 4 years. That helps you accumulate ""power"" to thrive in long run.",btohqsg
I think I'm lucky to be able to find smth that happens to be the best of both worlds  and I know that regardless of what side interests  what degree I take eventually  it'll all lead to the same route  but perhaps just diff pay or job position?¬ø,btohqsg
But I will still prioritize practicality esp since my family isn't well to do and I need to focus on supporting my parents and grandma first,btohqsg
Very real and important. I generally try to urge people who are more well off to realize that EVERYONE wants to support their family. But if you're more well-off  you actually have the privilege to explore more meaningful pursuits beyond money.A world where everyone just wants to earn most money possible for themselves  leads to increasing inequality and those below the bell curve of privilege to be doomed to poverty and whims of the powerful,btohqsg
Agree   unless their parents force them to inherit their family business or smth ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥ü•¥,btohqsg
There are studies on how family businesses rarely survive beyond 3 generations because the younger ones live in too much luxury to bring the business forward to remain competitive. Statistically  family businesses that groom passionate individuals have higher rate of survival. But asian families like to only take care of their own family and leave others to their own fates (my own opinion).,btohqsg
Sounds like the case for hawker stalls too HAHA but wow I didn't know that,btohqsg
what is meaningful is different for everyone though  maybe their definition for meaningful is further wealth accumulation,btohqsg
Agree that it's different for each person. And its worth a deeper conversation why further wealth accumulation is a worthwhile pursuit for someone who is already well to do.,btohqsg
Can you link me some of these studies,btohqsg
I‚Äôm interested in reading up on them,btohqsg
anyone knows of live chat websites?,btohqsg
Mother and daughter charged with murdering Myanmar domestic workerhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/mother-and-daughter-charged-with-murdering-myanmar-domestic-worker-0,btohqsg
a lot of terrible stuff happening one,btohqsg
I remember that is a documentary I watch on YouTube before it‚Äôs about a maid being abused in Hong Kong. Her employer use hot water and pour onto her face,btohqsg
IF YALL DM can yall pm me your school's music band posters  etc,btohqsg
is it true that you have to do daily RJ's at RP?,btohqsg
Hey to add on to the other comments  I think there‚Äôs no need to fret over such hypothetical situation which may not even materialise. At the current moment  we really have no clues if our passion will change in the future‚Ä¶. and actually not very productive to keep thinking about it.Also  maybe yall won‚Äôt agree with me  it is a case of ‚Äúwhatever happens  happens‚Äù ‚Ä¶ sometimes it‚Äôs out of your control  if one day you lan lan bo bian have to pivot  then you really have to pivot  just go with the flow  no use fighting against it.Case in point  I took a grab hitch last month  the 30~yo driver damn passionate about hospitality industry  hospitality diploma + scholarship to do hospitality degree oversea  come back sg spent 5 years work in 5* hotel  climb up the corporate ladder to become Guest Relations Manager. Then tio rekt sibei jialat by covid19 + upcoming family commitments  decided to just drop his passion & pivoted to HR instead.What‚Äôs more important now is to learn as much soft skills & transferrable skills as possible while obtaining mastery of whatever you are doing now so that:(a) you become more well-rounded (which is what employers are looking for nowadays)  then your boss will see you damn zai & promote you faster(hopefully with salary incrementüòÖ) so you climb the corporate ladder a lot faster(b) if one day  unfortunately you lan lan suck thumb have to pivot  the soft skills/transferrable will make the pivot less tough/painful,btohqsg
Thank you. I appreciate this whole paragraph.,btohqsg
