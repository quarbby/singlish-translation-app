buy ntuc voucher is eligible spend ?will this earn 4mpd also ?,btohqsg
U using to pay for ?,btohqsg
Will get the miles but u will paying high fees for the miles. So maybe if u value miles highly then cn go for it. For me I personally won't go for it haha,btohqsg
It‚Äôs 1.9% I think. And to get 1.2mpd not sure worth it anot hahaha,btohqsg
Yup 1.9 but u only get 1.2mpd so u paying 1.55 cents per mile. For me is quite high a price to pay. If ok for u cn go for it.,btohqsg
Max it out Liao. Hahaha cause it‚Äôs calendar month,btohqsg
Split payment ? Next mth max pay again. Or ask ur wife apply also lol,btohqsg
yes get 4mpd if paywave at fairprice/unity counter,btohqsg
Does Grab Food qualifies for 8% cash back on Citi Cash Back?,btohqsg
Why would u want to earn miles when there are 8 percent cashback card in the market. I buy 1k worth of ntuc at 1 go on citicashback card for my family spend  finish 1k then repeat again. Will have 80 dollar rebate next statement month,btohqsg
It depends on the individual person's valuation of a mile.if they value 1 mile = 2 cents for example  a 6 miles per dollar card would be equal to 12% cashback.,btohqsg
1 miles equal to 2 cent is too high valuation in my opinion  that is the ideal scenario but no the actual scenario. I have near 1m miles haha,btohqsg
Hi everyone  nice meeting you guys here. I am currently using Saxo as my brokerage but I realise they do charge a custodian fee of 0.12%  am thinking to switch to either Tiger or Moomoo or any other that you guys can recommend? I am not into trading so basically just own a few US stocks and will keep them for years. Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
comparing recent inflated Revenue tickets  I would say 2 cents per mile is already rather conservative  but I'm just a beginner miles player..,btohqsg
Really? Unless its above 2 cents   usually i dont redeem,btohqsg
There is a few problem with miles chasing  is your spending enough to redeem the ticket within miles expiry  airline devalue miles all the time. If u compare economy to biz class redemption. U realise that often it is cheaper to pay for economy then redeem miles. Miles is only high value if u redeem biz class,btohqsg
Plus u often have to book way early to get good miles redemption deal for biz class saver,btohqsg
5 million hawker meals fully redeemed already?!,btohqsg
How much cash back can I get for 10 000 Citi Rewards Points?,btohqsg
Ya dbs $3 fully redeemed  i missed,btohqsg
No.I do not qualify.Or rather since I already have funds inside  if I withdraw and pump back in same amount   my net increase is $0.Need to increase net amount by at least $10k to trigger the coupon. The coupon will only apply to the net increase.So let‚Äôs say u rich. U have $100k inside. Then u top up $10k and get the 5.8% coupon. The coupon only applies to the $10k and not to the rest of the $100k inside before the top up.But let‚Äôs say u have $0 inside MooMoo before promo start and then u top up $10k. Then u would have increased net amount by $10k n get the coupon.So to me  this promo good for those that have no funds in MooMoo cash plus before the promo.If u already have  then it‚Äôs not so lucrative.My plan moving forward is if I want Fullerton cash fund  to buy from WeBull instead. They hardly have any cash fund promo. But MooMoo n Tiger regularly have. So it‚Äôs best to leave $0 in MooMoo/Tiger Fullerton cash fund and park it in WeBull Fullerton cash fund instead.  Then when MooMoo/Tiger have promo  then can withdraw from WeBull and participate. Then this is considered as fresh funds and also top up. Once promo over  transfer back to WeBull.Besides  WeBull redemption n withdrawal for cash fund is T+1 from my experience  unlike t+2 for moomoo/Tiger. So u get back $ faster and reduce opportunity cost lost while $ is in transit.,btohqsg
I haven't been active on moomoo so think I will try and see how it works.,btohqsg
Then yes  this promo is a must for u.5.8% guaranteed for 30 days. Don‚Äôt let it go to waste.NoteOnce u deposit and subscribe $10k  the 5.8% will be auto applied . U don‚Äôt need to manually select or redeem coupon.IMHO Just top up  up to $10-$30k for the lower tier coupon and if u have cash  top up $50k to $80k to maximise the higher tier,btohqsg
I also recently went to the MooFest2023 at Suntec and asked them the same question and they say that if I intent to take out and put back in below the net amount  then I won‚Äôt qualify.My heart died inside a bit but I put on fake smile and took their goodie bag. They got quite a lot of freebies.My only consolation is that because I went for the MooFest  I got $30 fund cash coupon and $30 stock cash coupon for just checking in at the venue  so at least I got that going for me. Got back $30 after 3 biz days for doing $5k top up.,btohqsg
Do I need to move $ to GXS saving pocket just to earn interest?,btohqsg
Which is more worthy usually when swipe foreign currency transaction ? Pay the Mastercard fees direct and earn boosted miles or link with amaze ?,btohqsg
Telegramafter calculating fees/rewards  you can check how your card go against YouTrip  Trust and Amaze that Chris have already helped to calculate in the video.,btohqsg
Hi. Can I check  if I‚Äôll be spending almost 7.8k in 1 single transaction. Which card is the best for cash back / points etc?Currently I have citi cashback+,btohqsg
Hi. I‚Äôm buying a brompton bicycle from brompton junction @ Funan.They allow credit card. And cost is almost 7900.My citi cashback+ got cashback of 1.5%. So I‚Äôm checking if there‚Äôs any other card that has better cashback?,btohqsg
Oh. Ok I go check it out. U know where to buy? Carousell?,btohqsg
How do you know the $30 cash is credited to your acct? (Not credit the $30 coupon).,btohqsg
do u have SCB manhattan? It has 3% cashback for up to $6667,btohqsg
Hi. I don‚Äôt have. I maybe go see if I can apply.,btohqsg
This is the $30 fund cash coupon I got from MooFest2023. I justdeposit $5k and subscribe into Fullerton Cash Fund. 3 biz days later I got $30 credited into my securities account which I then withdrew.,btohqsg
Yup carousell  look out for good review seller,btohqsg
Just rmb to check your merchant take ecapitavoucher  market rate is ard 4 percent off. Much better then card if u not miles chaser,btohqsg
no more new application already..Go with Queenie's suggestion.. just be careful don't get scammed with fake Capita vouchers.,btohqsg
Ok. Got it. Thanks.To get the $30 cash coupon for buying ETF. Any ETF recommendation?,btohqsg
I only used the $30 fund cash coupon. I haven‚Äôt use the stock cash coupon.To use the stock cash coupon u need to buy ETF worth at least $5k SGD leh.If u buy $4 999.99 SGD the coupon will be greyed out.I cannot recommend what ETF to buy  lol. I also don‚Äôt have $5k to 1 shot buy. Now markets all time high  u want to enter meh?,btohqsg
Fund cash coupon also $5k  right?I m searching which ETF will have relatively low risk to hold for 1 month. Not sure is there any ETF  which has underlining asset using cash fund  to invest.,btohqsg
nowadays can only use ecapitavouchers at retailer. Ecapitavouchers can only hold $1k. Not tested but think can buy eCapitavochers from Wogi then load and use $1k by $1k. Many cards rewards for online spend on Wogi https://heymax.ai/v2/search/wogi?useVisaApi=false&country=SG&paymentTags=,btohqsg
I think it will be difficult to find.1% of $5000 is $50.I‚Äôm sure u know that its easy for even broad based ETFs like VOO to move more than 1% a day in either direction.Consider risk reward carefully.I didn‚Äôt use the $30 stock cash coupon because if my ETF moves by more than 0.8-1% in a day negatively  even the $30 stock coupon won‚Äôt protect my capital.Q2 earnings are just only beginning and u can see the bloodshed yesterday.Maybe the more prudent thing to consider is the long term value of the ETF rather than just buying ETF to get the $30 after 3 days.So that I‚Äôm trying to say is that whatever etf u choose needs to have at least 3-5 consecutive days of earnings coz u won‚Äôt see the $30 until 3 biz days later. But if your etf drops by 0.8-1% for even 1 day while u are waiting  then u lose $ liao. This one is more like trader mindset. 3-5 days earning coz if u sell etf after that  u will new t+2 settlement and its opportunity cost lost.But if u long term investor then this $30 will help a bit to cover fees la haha.,btohqsg
I see. Ok thanks a lot. I‚Äôll go check it out too.,btohqsg
Usually I try to calculate the stock coupon can buy me how many days of losses before I use.For this $30 coupon  it can only protect my downside by 1 day. Then I held hostage by the 3 biz days waiting time for the coupon. Which I can potentially bleed more. So to me not worth it if I only holding for 3-5 days.Maybe your saving grace is that USD to SGD is weaker now. $1 usd buys $1.32 SGD.But even this spread won‚Äôt improve in just a few days .üëç,btohqsg
Does wallet top up constitute as online spend with UOB Evol?,btohqsg
