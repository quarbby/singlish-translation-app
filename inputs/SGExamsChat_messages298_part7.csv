@DharshhaFahrenheit 451Part one : the hearth and the salamanderClarisse first meeting with montag :“ are you happy ? She said ““Happy ! Of all the nonsense . He stopped laughing”“Of course I’m happy . What does she think ? I’m not ? He asked the quiet room”Mildred suicide 😃👍:“His wife stretched on the bed   uncovered and cold   like a body displayed on the lid of a tomb”“And in her ears the little seashells   the thimble radios ramped tight   and an electronic ocean of sound   of music and talk and music and talk coming in   coming in on the shore of her unsleeping mind ““The object gave a full clink and slid off in darkness”“There was only the singing of the thimble - wasps in her tamped- shut ears   faintly   in and out of her nostrils   and her not caring whether it came or went   went or came ““The small crystal bootle of sleeping -tablets which earlier today had been filled with thirty capsules and which now Lay uncapped  and empty in the light of the tiny flare ““ he felt that the stars had been pulverised by the sound of the black jets and that in the morning the earth would be covered with their dust like a strange snow . That was his idiot thought as he stood shivering in the dark   and let his lips go on moving and moving ““Got so many   starting a few years ago   we had the special machines built ““If only someone’s else’s flesh and brain and memory . If only they could have taken her mind along to the dry-cleaners and emptied the pockets and steamed and cleansed it and reblocked  it and bought it back in the morning “Love test :“I’m still crazy . The rain feels good . I love to walk in it ““I don’t think I’d like that “ he said“I guess it’s the last one the dandelions this year . I didn’t think I’d find one in the lawn this late . Have you ever heard of rubbing it under your chin ? Look “”what a shame “ she said “your not in love with anyone ““Yes I am ! ”“It doesn’t show ““The psychiatrist wants to know why I go out and hike around in the forests and watch the birds and collect butterflies. I’ll show you my collection some day ““And let rain fall into my mouth .it tastes just like wine . Have you ever tried it ?”“How odd . How strange . And my wife thirty and yet you seem so much older at times . I can’t get over it ““He tilted his head back in the rain  for just a few moments and opened his mouth “Montag and the hound“A strange rasping combination of electrical sizzle   a frying sound   a scraping of metal   a turn of cogs that seemed rusty and ancient with suspicion ““The growl simmered in the beast and it looked at him”“It doesn’t like me” said montag”“What  the hound ?”Other quotes :“One day it was raining   the next it was clear   the day after that the wind blew strong   and the day after that it was mild and calm   and they day after that calm day was a day like a furnace of summer ““He held his pants out into an abyss and let them fall into darkness “Burning women quotes :“The women knelt among the books   touching the drenched leather and cardboard   reading the girly titles with her fingers while her eyes accused montag ““Where’s your common sense ? None of these books agree with each other . You’ve been locked up here for years with a regular fanned Tower of Babel . Snap out of it ! The people in those books never lived . Come on now ! ““We’re due back at the house . Bedsides these fanatics always try sucide ; the Patterns’s familiar ““His pink face burnt and shiny from a thousand fires and night excitement”Montags talk with Mildred :“ funny   how funny   not to remember where it when you met your husband or wife ““He tried to count how many times she swallowed and he thought of the visit from the two zinc -oxide -faced man with cigarettes in their straight lined mouths and the electronic eyed snake winding down into the layer upon layer of night and stone and stagnant spring water “,btohqsg
“And he thought of her lying on the bed with the techinicians standing straight over her   not bent with concern   but only standing straight   arms folded ““The walls were always talking to montag ““The electric thimble moved like a praying mantis on the pillow  touched by her hand . Now it was in her ear again   humming ““The hound   he thought . It’s out there tonight . It’s out there now   if I opened the window “Montags talk with Beatty :“I’ve seen it all .you were going to call for a night off”“Every fireman   sooner or later   hits this . They only need understanding   to know how the wheels run . Need to know the history of our profession. They don’t feed it to rookies like they used to ““Books cut shorter . Condensations . Digests . Tabloids . Everything boils down to the gag   the snap ending ““Mildred smoothed the bedclothes. Montag felt his heart jump and jump against as she patted his pillow”“Empty the theatres save for clowns and furnish the rooms with glass walls and pretty colours running up and down the walls like confetti or blood or sherry or Sauterne”“A book is a loaded gun in the house next door . Burn it . Take the shot from the weapon . Breach mans mind ““She didn’t wanted to know how a thing was done   but why ““ that’s all we live for   isn’t it ? For pleasure ，for titillation ? And you must admit our culture provides plenty of these ““If you don’t want a man unhappy politically   don’t give him two sides to a question to worry joke; give him one   better yet   give him none”“ we stand against the small tide of those who wants to make everyone unhappy with conflicting theory and thought ““ we let the firemen keep the book twenty-four hours.if he hasn’t burned it by then   we simply come and burn it for him ““Whether we like this or not   we’re in it . I’ve never asked for much from you in all these years   but I ask it now   I pleat for it . We’ve got to start somewhere here   figuring out why   we are in such a mess”“Montag felt the presence of someone beyond the door   waiting   listening  then the footsteps going away down the walk and over the lawn ““Once   books appealed to a few people   here there   everywhere   they could afford to be different “THEMES“ Forty years go when the last liberal arts college shut down due to the lack of student and patronage “-theme : knowledge   technology“One hour of TV class   another hour of basketball or baseball or running   another hour of transcription history or painting a picture   another hour of more sports   but do you know   we never ask questions “Themes : knowledge   censorship“The white clown is on tonight “Themes : technology  mass media   censorship  knowledge“There must be something in books   something to make a women stay in a burning house   there must be something in there   you don’t stay for nothing “Themes : knowledge“We get these cases nine or ten a night   got so many starting a few years ago we had the special machines build “Themes : happiness   technology“Social to me means talking about things like this”Themes : happiness“ we are nothing but dust jackets for our books   of no significance otherwise “Themes : knowledge  “If you don’t want a house build   don’t use nails   if you want to make a man unhappy politically   don’t give him 2 sides to a question to worry him   give him one “Themes : mass media   knowledge“But clarisses favourite subject wasn’t herself   it was everyone else   me “Themes : happiness  technology   mass media“Happiness is important  fun is everything and I keep sitting there saying to myself   I’m not happy   I’m not happy”Themes : happiness“She’s nothing to me   she shouldn’t have books “Themes : censorship“We stand against the small tide of those who want to make everyone unhappy with conflicting theory “Themes ; happiness“The books are to remind us what asses and fools we are”Theme : mass media   knowledge“The target of the well read man “Theme : knowledgePart two: the sieve and the sand events / quotes“,btohqsg
