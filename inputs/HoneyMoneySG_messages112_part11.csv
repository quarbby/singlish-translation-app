Why split? Can always self transfer to UOB One account.,btohqsg
You have $500 worth ofpostedtransaction inMay? Any refundspostedinMay? Anyineligibletransactions? What's your MAB?There's a 0.6% p.a. bonus interest even if you only hit spend criteria  so it's highly likely you failed to hit spend criteria.Unless your MAB is less than $4?,btohqsg
Easy way to confirm is go on your app and check your bonus interest history. They will tell you what level you have hit  how much is your clocked spending and salary crediting.,btohqsg
Anyone know how ocbc rewards adjusted point calculation in the monthly statement? Looks like it come from previous month or statement 9x and minus refund,btohqsg
@Hann_foo0.6% for UOB One account if hit spend criteria only:https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.page,btohqsg
@voidhighlorddo not advertise here (even if indirectly),btohqsg
Thanks! So the lowest possible fee is US$10 and it goes by % of transaction $ right?I might have to check if can still use cheque and pay a cheaper fee than TT fee‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Thanks for the info.I used to be able to use USD cheque to transfer USD within SG for free but now I have to check again what‚Äôs the lowest possible fee‚Ä¶ otherwise I‚Äôll leave the USD in the current bank for the time being lol,btohqsg

Probably if you have a USD chequing account with your own cheque book  that could be free. Singapore banks don't charge for processing Singapore-issued USD cheques e.g. if you drop it into the cheque deposit box.,btohqsg
I did shopee on mobile app most recently,btohqsg
Yes but I think most banks now no longer accept cheque unless pay a feeBut I think paying cheque fee still cheaper than TT USD‚Ä¶ provided bank willing to process the cheque for me lolAnyway I‚Äôm thinking to park USD somewhere that can earn more interests‚Ä¶ Currently parking at CIMB USD FD‚Ä¶ the FD rate dropped from 5.2% to 5% this monthAnyone has any suggestions on best method to grow USD in SG bank account?,btohqsg
I feel 5.2 drop to 5% still OK. 0.2,btohqsg
DBS also has quite good USD FD rates,btohqsg
Hi guys  new to Miles. Would like to ask how the calculation of 1.25 CPM is derived. If 4MPD = 1M per 0.25D  wouldn't that make 25 Cents per mile?1.25 CPM is equivalent to $0.0125 which is much less than the $0.25 per mile. Am I misunderstanding something here?,btohqsg
4mpd means that you earn 4 miles per every dollar you spend on a purchase. Of course  you don't earn 1 dollar worth of miles for every dollar that you spend  which is the calculation that you made. Instead miles are worth much less than 1 dollar and this is based on your value of a mile (subjective for each individual). So 1.25 cpm here means the 4 miles that you earn per dollar are valued at 1.25 cents each = 5 cents total. This is equivalent value to 5% cashback.,btohqsg
hi  i just applied for singsaver‚Äôs citi premiermiles promo.im wondering if paying bills will qualify for the $500 spent?because in tnc it states ‚Äúbill payments made using the Eligible Card as a source of funds‚Äù  im unsure if this means paying utilities bill and phone bills can workand also  is there any way i can track how much of my spendings are qualified?,btohqsg
they say qualifying spend refers to any retail transactions which DO NOT arise from bill payments made using the card,btohqsg
ah my bad  did not read that part ü´†jumped the gun,btohqsg
I also recently applied for singsaver‚Äôs citi premiermiles promo. Still no news for my card application status,btohqsg
wonder what's the average waiting time?,btohqsg
Mine are usually flat fee usd10 regardless of size,btohqsg
Usually will be usd2-3 for cheque issuance.And receiving bank usually is usd10 but I had mixed dp. Some charged some don‚Äôt. For usd cheques.But for tt in. 100% of the time is usd10 charge.,btohqsg
What card should I use to chargetrip.com?,btohqsg
Uob lady travel category or dbs woman wmc.,btohqsg
Ok thank u! Do they charge in sgd or in foreign ccy that I will incur fx cost?,btohqsg
sgd  unless you opt to change or buy from ctrip instead,btohqsg
Trip.comdoesn't have 1% cross border fee  unlike agoda,btohqsg
Which is the cheapest way to invest in US treasures bills? ETF?,btohqsg
no that gives 30% withholding. buy on interactive brokers,btohqsg
I just saw my HSBC EGA gives a everyday+ interest (I opened the bank account last month and signed up for the incremental promo).. is that only the 1% extra cos it seems way off.. when will I get the extra 3+%?,btohqsg
Hi to all. Im currently using citi premiermiles CC. What should i be using for daliy use? Like dinning and online shopping like shopee and lazada,btohqsg
Normally is 2 month after cycle ends  before fulfilment date,btohqsg
Check the fulfilment date on the t&c for the promo you registered for.,btohqsg
Morning all - simply go tranx on evol card doesn‚Äôt count towards the 500 spending on UOB one account? And the mobile contactless spend?,btohqsg
Have you triedheymax.ai? It's a great tool to check for transaction eligibility.,btohqsg
Hi  I have a question on Kris+ as I seldom use it for purchases. Can I use Google Pay + UOB PPV via Kris+ to clock 4mpd? Does this qualify ad contactless payment under UOB PPV? If no  then I'll just use G Pay + Amaze + CRMC. TIA,btohqsg
Another question. I plan to visit a restaurant that sells 10% discount vouchers in Kris+. The restaurant itself also offers 3 Kris+ points. Do I get Kris+ points for buying voucher? I don't think so but wish to confirm.Assuming there's a Mastercard promo in Kris+ ongoing (there isn't for now)  will voucher purchase meet the MC promo condition in Kris+?If I use $100 voucher to pay the restaurant bill of $150  i suppose I can still clock 3 Kris+ points when i use Kris+ app to pay the balance of $50  correct? TIA,btohqsg
Yes  you get whatever x mpd that the restaurant offers when you buy vouchers.Vouchers purchase qualify for MC promos.Yes  any balance paid after voucher offset still earns the x mpd.,btohqsg
Google pay + ppv on Kris+ will be online dining and qualifies for 4mpd. Online dining is in the whitelist for PPV.,btohqsg
Hi  any suggestions on what card to use for insurance and investment (ILP) in AIA payments? I have UOB evol  citipremiermiles and amaze+citi rewards. üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Now only left maybank plat visa for insurance if use directly.,btohqsg
I used heymax to go through agoda to book hotel yesterday for jb  but I didn‚Äôt see hey mile added. Anyone know When will it reflect?,btohqsg
Some restaurant have additional term and conditions,btohqsg
Haven‚Äôt encountered yet but yes  read the terms before you decide to buy any vouchers.,btohqsg
AIA won't accept visa for recurring.,btohqsg
For AIA:1. CardUp + CC that's eligible for rewards for CardUpor2. any MasterCard CCFollowed by HSBC EGA GIRO to pay the CC.,btohqsg
Thanks. I'll test using Amaze wallet with zero credits first to check MCC when buying that restaurant voucher in Kris+. Just to confirm the MCC of voucher purchase is a restaurant,btohqsg
