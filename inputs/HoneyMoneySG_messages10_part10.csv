oh. So u still buying S27?,btohqsg
Huh. so u still think S27 is cheaper than Endowus S&P?,btohqsg
Hi anybody know abt using cpf to pay sch fees,btohqsg
Because i heard got interest rate when pay back  but after 55 no need pay back,btohqsg
how do you get points from grab to jipay? i tried grab to ez-link there were no points collected,btohqsg
Already outdated. It already been nerf,btohqsg
Jipay will charge u 2.5 percent for grabpay to jipay,btohqsg
what’s the best way right now for stacking ?,btohqsg
CNA interview me on FIRE again  must readhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/fire-movement-financial-independence-retire-early-2881076,btohqsg
S27 is cheaper than endowus long term. I've already maxed my SRS contributions this year,btohqsg
So wat are the options to better and fully utilise with SRS??,btohqsg
It's not only after 55  the CPF OA+SA for your parent(s) must be above FRS  then can apply for waiver of payment,btohqsg
And yes will have accrued interest applied,btohqsg
congrats ;)What do you think about the guy featured in the article (Benedict Tan) who is targeting 2.5% yield on S$2.4m portfolio.Is the yield too conservative? It's lower than the inflation rate.,btohqsg
It's fair for a conservative investor. But don't think I should judge anyone's targets,btohqsg
The process itself is more important than the number. Do you enjoy doing it? What's next after achieving FI?,btohqsg
I think they have a list of requirements to fulfil. For example full time undergraduate course is one of time. Then just apply online. If unsure still  call them,btohqsg
I hope they didn’t twist your words again,btohqsg
I like this part of the article best“To me  FIRE is just about having the most options available in your life. If you want to work  good. If you don’t want to work  also good.”Options to pursue what we are passionate about and to do that without any financial constraints ” said Ms Purushothaman.,btohqsg
Yes  live and let live. Just let other people live their own lifes and mind our own business,btohqsg
Hi  getting general opinion if anyone bought SSB with SRS?,btohqsg
Just bought  waiting for confirmation on amount awarded,btohqsg
hi chris  from your top 5 credit card video  if I use Instarem with Citi Rewards Credit Card  it will will be counted as online transaction instead. But if I use it to pay travel package from travel agency (which is blacklisted)  can it still earn 10x reward points as online transaction?,btohqsg
Nope it cant from what i remember but maybe chris can confirm,btohqsg
Instarem will pass the mcc to citi  so citi will know that it’s blacklisted mcc,btohqsg
Does Citi premiere miles works with Instarem ?,btohqsg
So for my day to day spending  I shd use Instarem instead of my Citi premieremiles CC ? So can clock rewards on both card ?,btohqsg
Depends on what you mean by day to day spending  citi premier miles is general spending card  so you do get 1.2 mpd  with or without instarem,btohqsg
I assume you’re holding the MC version,btohqsg
So if I use Instarem  I get to receive the cashback on Instarem side + 1.2mpd on Citi side.,btohqsg
Cashback for instarem is only for the Foreign currency expense  so if u spend using instarem + citi pm in malaysia  yes should get both cashback and miles,btohqsg
Just that the miles is 1.2mpd instead of 2x. Got it,btohqsg
Confused. Then how will those spending that are not eligible but clocked as online and be eligible under Instarem for 10x points?,btohqsg
Citi rewards will give whitelisted mcc or online trx that’s not on blacklisted mcc list,btohqsg
So dining (not whitelisted  not blacklited) + instarem -> 10x,btohqsg
Haircut (not whitelisted  not blacklisted) + instarem -> 10x,btohqsg
MCC is set by the merchant  online/offline is just the transaction channel,btohqsg
You can use AMAZE to make an offline transaction online  but its MCC remains,btohqsg
Can I ask  if I use the instarem card + citi and use it in overseas. Instarem will do the currency conversion first before passing it to citi?,btohqsg
I see. Is this the best way/card combi etc  to use it in overseas?,btohqsg
If u have 4mpd then yes  but sometimes it’s worth it to get the mpd bumped from 1.2 to 2 mpd by paying the fcy fee,btohqsg
For those who have multiple cards  how do y’all keep track of each cards spending to maximize your rewards?,btohqsg
No  as what others have said. The underlying MCC as travel doesn't change  which Citi Rewards excludes,btohqsg
I need some advice. My main Miles card is Citi premiere visa which can't be link to amaze. I am going oversea next month and is expected to make couple of purchase. I have signed up for amaze card with Chris referral and I am choosing a MC miles card to pair it with just for this trip shopping. Any advice on which card I should get. Some of my consideration is get a duplicate citi premiere miles MC/ UOB KrisFlyer / UOB Priv Miles.,btohqsg
