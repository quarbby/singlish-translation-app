I like how this threads comments have devolved into talk about NUS Rc and scholarships,btohqsg
No one pointed out the fact that OP was sexually abused by his parents and should probably be reporting it,btohqsg
When grades and uni > abuse,btohqsg

Hi anyone know how does a GPA 3.8 from Poly to go NTU?,btohqsg
Meaning need average A or A- in all the subjects in the 3 yr poly?,btohqsg
Maybe 3.7 or 3.8 play safe.,btohqsg
theres no A- in poly (or singapore poly that is)   so you need to average A (4.0) in all your subjects  with occasional B+ (3.5),btohqsg
I wonder whats the igp for SMU SE vs CS for this yr,btohqsg
Wow so tough to get into NTU.,btohqsg
3.5 with ABA should be able to enter CBC,btohqsg
I just noticed double major is 3.56,btohqsg
Do you guys personally wear watches for exams? I feel like getting another watch for the purpose of exams since the watch I wear all the time is a running watch with Bluetooth function and thus would constitute as a ‚Äúsmartwatch‚Äù which is not allowed in exams..,btohqsg
I have a pocketwatch  actually quite useful,btohqsg
but the clock on the wall is good enough,btohqsg
If u use a watch during ur practice papers to keep track of how long u spend on a question type‚Ä¶ id suggest u should use it during exams as well,btohqsg
But if u dont use watch for ur prac‚Ä¶ dun use it during exams‚Ä¶ theres no point to it,btohqsg
I bought a new one for MYE,btohqsg
Ohh I should too  I can‚Äôt perform without a watch,btohqsg
Probably yes  we banned your alt account,btohqsg
Did you post anything sus recently?,btohqsg
Anything that you're not supposed to post,btohqsg
If one drops from pure double sciences to combined  will one need to take up a course ? Course as in Dnt FNN etc.,btohqsg
My fren drop from pure physics pure Chem she didn‚Äôt take coursework,btohqsg
i doubt it but depends on ur sch,btohqsg
damn ntu cs dropped? was 3.92 10th percentile last year,btohqsg
unlikely.Not enough curriculum time to do a new subject,btohqsg
3.92 cut off was insane tho like thats top 5% of poly students,btohqsg

hello guys i need help  if i am not accepted in the course i chose in nus  but offered another course instead(second choice)  do i ignore or reject the offer? (i am serving ns now btw so i have 2 more years),btohqsg
Usually the intake cut off does not vary much,btohqsg
So is your grades close to their 10 percentile intake grade? If there is a gap then u apply next two years your chance remains low,btohqsg
i got 76.25 hoping to apply to nus business,btohqsg
i mean wouldn't you want to accept something this year anyways? haha it doesnt affect u reapplying next yr?,btohqsg
^^ you can accept first this year and reapply next year,btohqsg
should definitely accept first then appeal for this year (if possible) AND apply next year,btohqsg
