Medisave withdrawals are subject to various limits. Generally  one can’t use 100% of their Medisave for operations so which is why it’s good practice to at least get a As-charged hospitalisation plan. Whether B/A wards or even private hospitals  getting one is better than none.,btohqsg
Medisave alone is not great but you can use it to give you additional health related coverages. If you want to learn more by your own  you can use these 2 links from MOH:1. Hospitalisation Plans (Integrated Shield Plans):https://www.moh.gov.sg/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medishield-life/about-integrated-shield-plans2. Disability Care Plans (CareShield Life):https://www.careshieldlife.gov.sg/careshield-life/about-careshield-life.htmlIf you want to receive direct advice and have an existing insurance agent/financial advisor  you can look for them.,btohqsg

No cash rebates or miles.As mentioned in the linked msg referenced by Wind Wu  it is an extended settlement.Instead of paying up by T+2  depending on the credit card billing date  you can pay up 1.5mths later thereby letting your cash earn more interest,btohqsg
Zackeach card may have it's own category spending limits as well so check what each card's benefits,btohqsg
