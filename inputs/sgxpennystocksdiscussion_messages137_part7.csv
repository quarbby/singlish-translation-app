Tiagong can short all airline stock,btohqsg
no wonder when you say i did not realise,btohqsg
Only saw your husband  where u,btohqsg
just one burning question this uncle have,btohqsg
lets say vaccine can distribute got storage got ppe,btohqsg
this inherent vaccine temperature will be -75Â°c?,btohqsg
I still dono why medical will rally? Just dj crash only,btohqsg
then inject into human body not cause damage to our body meh,btohqsg
or when take out and inject then a bit temperature difference start to lose effectiveness,btohqsg
TiAgong only la. They say vaccine not even possible as need negative 80 degree to stored,btohqsg
Where the hell they find the place to store,btohqsg
you got try take dryice using hands or not,btohqsg
this is the only concern i have,btohqsg
later inject then i need to be hospitalised,btohqsg
Hahaha but investor mostly read title no read details,btohqsg
Unless the title is no where in earth store vaccine  then medical rly will rally,btohqsg
Vaccine will be thawed and warmed up before injection...,btohqsg
Only long term storage needs cold,btohqsg
U store ur food in the fridge but u dont eat cold food right...,btohqsg
at least bo take vaccine secure whattake got 10% still,btohqsg
Will I become iceman after vaccine,btohqsg
But true that if needs -80 storage,btohqsg
so at what tenperature the vaccine component breaks down,btohqsg
Usually 4 degree will be ok,btohqsg
S&P Gives Up Vaccine Gains  Tech Is Tumbling As Momo Meltdown Accelerateshttp://feedproxy.google.com/~r/zerohedge/feed/~3/cU91E979r6A/sp-gives-vaccine-gains-tech-tumbling-momo-meltdown-accelerates,btohqsg
very curious what kind of chemical is involvedthat the icing point need until so low before can be transported and stored,btohqsg
paiseh ah i bo study much on this vaccine aspect so very silly questions,btohqsg
well so much for 90% effective,btohqsg
Most likely to prevent the denaturing of the rna in the vaccine. I think.,btohqsg
it's very sensitive to pH and temperature,btohqsg
No lah  not silly.  The super cold requirement is because the vaccine is based on RNA,btohqsg
Which is v sensitive to degradation,btohqsg
up few degrees the RNA useless liao,btohqsg
Typical vaccines we have now are protein vaccine or inactivated virus vaccine,btohqsg
Those can be stored at 4 degree or -20 at most,btohqsg
tmr sg tech sure lao sai also,btohqsg
Imagine the doc/nurse place vaccine on the table  talk/explain/ask questions for 10min.. vaccine turn bad liao ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
They ask u many q before swab,btohqsg
thanks for the article now it makes senseThey can be kept in an ultra-low temperature freezer for up to six months  or for five days at 2-8 degrees C â€“ a type of refrigeration commonly available at hospitals  Bencker said.The Pfizer storage units can also be refilled with ice for up to 15 days  she said.But shots will spoil in around five days at normal refrigeration temperatures of slightly above freezing. BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin told Reuters the companies are analyzing if they can extend that for two weeks.think so complex i rather wait for herd immunity,btohqsg
Then once at swab they do,btohqsg
From mass production  to contains the vaccine  transport it  until the storage of the destinations  can tell that vaccine definitely not this year story,btohqsg
Go to india for a month,btohqsg
no la hide at home wait covid pass out also herd immunity ma,btohqsg
Up Lorry how.. one way ticket to heaven ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
But the good thing is after u get u no need masks,btohqsg
U be sero + for 180 days,btohqsg
Anyway if u deal wif c+ people u will know,btohqsg
until now never take much vaccinations,btohqsg
Maybe it's just a ploy to release this kind of news to manipulate stock market,btohqsg
Im not a doc but i was wif covid people b4,btohqsg
