it doesn't hurt to try and appeal to a course u find urself liking to pursue further education inbut from what i know  even if u meet the course cut-off point  it's a bit hard if u didn't meet the course minimum entry requirements,btohqsg
ahh....but i mean it's just my English manüò≠üò≠üò≠ like rp business cut off is 26   i got 20....but my el just 7üò≠üò≠üò≠üôèüôè,btohqsg
i rmbr their sch site mentioned only for specific courses,btohqsg
at least ur one is off by one point only,btohqsg
honestly why notim older than the other girls in my batch but im doing p well and im where i want to be,btohqsg
ok maybe mi is better with the new principal,btohqsg
Well I feel like visiting mi one day lol,btohqsg
cant tell if its the fact that they let in ppl who borderline failed o lvls or ppl go to mi and think they can be complacent cuz #3 years,btohqsg
mindset issues plaguing the entire of sg,btohqsg
That one is attitude issue uu,btohqsg
the former was always a good thing for those that didn't score too well in Osit just ended up being made use of all the wrongdoings and weird shit,btohqsg
Girl i know people who were 21 when they entered MI,btohqsg
if u don't understand what  double-edged sword is  think of hypocrites & multi-faced attitudes ruining the system,btohqsg
Don't mi have age limit ?,btohqsg
But hello rumchel my fellow MI junior,btohqsg
ik some ppl who studied hard but js didnt know how to study smart,btohqsg
which is kinda L but mi doesn‚Äôt help u for those kind of stuff,btohqsg
the latter (attitude problem) can definitely affect the former (sg education structural formatting) which makes it even worse,btohqsg
not just MI kids fall prey to that and yeah  sch  environment rly plays a role,btohqsg
Shit why do i know old ass people who can graduate at 25,btohqsg
its up to u if uw to be brainwashed and caught up witb the gossip at the expense of your grades(or u can learn the average lawsku kid way and keep up with hot gos while keeping ur grades),btohqsg
21 or 22 max in y1,btohqsg
i rmbr cuz a certain someone was telling me how he cldnt retain cuz hes old,btohqsg
that's the reality that students would prefer to not admit,btohqsg
i tell off ppl ( that usually ends up ex-friends now ) who have attitude & mindset problems,btohqsg
my brain cells literally dry off faster than taking any exam,btohqsg
possible but it'll take another few decades,btohqsg
it took 20 years for certain policies in sg to change  but sg's traditional set mindset that was originally formed has already affected a lot of things,btohqsg
i think its js an individual problem,btohqsg
collectively as a whole  it becomes even more of a major issue,btohqsg
ok this one a bit too deep alr,btohqsg
imagine bunchimg up a bunch of ppl who either think they area) a loser for not making it to jc and a failure in life so they give upb) ppl who dk wat they want to do in lifec) ppl who js simply dk how to study,btohqsg
shld I go mi or retake o lvls and go jc?,btohqsg
actl  u can see such dynamic combinations in pretty much every schoolit's just how each school manages and handles everything,btohqsg
i see individual problem literally everywhere,btohqsg
tell me u see a in rj,btohqsg
that's what i call ultimate madness,btohqsg
these are the ppl who probably know that they're in deep shit but don't want to do a single thing to make their lives btr,btohqsg
why not use ur keyboard warriors drive to strive for btr motivation & achieve more things? idk  and i gave up on such ppl,btohqsg
i dare to say twt  reddit  discord  insta & even facebook are full of keyboard warriors from young to old,btohqsg
where did this convo even go,btohqsg
but usually once a sch gets principal changes  there'll be some subtle differences,btohqsg
both the principal & vice principal team,btohqsg
Eh does anyone know when is MI open house,btohqsg
Why u wanna go back there?,btohqsg
