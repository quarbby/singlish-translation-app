On 1st October I can take out all the money that I have put inside ? Or I need to keep it all in till fulfillment date 30th November ?,btohqsg
not sure what is fulfilment date  new clause in the TnC?,btohqsg
I have 2k already I‚Äôm just for the sake of keeping the account alive - if I take it out now will what matter ? And after put in all the amount and register,btohqsg
nothing will happen  2k balance was to avoid fall under fee,btohqsg

Hi.... Need advice.. in May month I have  2k in my HSBC EGA Account  and on 1 Jun opted in the bonus interest program  I deposited 200k  to get around 4.6% interest..July month I took out 100k. If I keep the remaining 102k for this month and next month  will I still get 3.6% interest?,btohqsg
This month is August. You can get 3.6% bonus interest for any amounts over the existing 102k  assuming it's 102k throughout Jul.,btohqsg
oh. any idea the ADB is with reference to June or July?,btohqsg
mean there is no interest for the existing 102k  right? So have to move to CIMB Fastsaver or Maribank  any other options?,btohqsg
referring to the incremental ADB (fresh funds). It's comparison is with June or July?,btohqsg
Yes the Page 2 will provide clearer example. But i think should be July too if consistent with past promotions,btohqsg
which credit card earns cashback or miles for axs insurance payment?,btohqsg
I still couldn‚Äôt find the Aug promo on hsbc website. It‚Äôs still showing for July,btohqsg

Hello Everyone When do we get the interest (salary+save+spend) credited to ocbc 360 account?,btohqsg
hello! curious question from my side:why do some physical merchants in singapore require you to slot in your credit card in the terminal? vs just tapping/ paywave?and does slotting your credit card in the terminal count for contactless payments? (aka cards that only get benefits through contactless - aka UOB Visa Platinum and UOB Preferred Platinum),btohqsg
Can check if it counted into min spend of 800?,btohqsg
Not counted. For PPV   even card contactless not counted for bonus uni$.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  for amaze + citi rewards  is the 1000 dollars cap for the 4mpd like for the both of them? I mean can it be 1k using amaze and 1k using citi online spend,btohqsg
Or just up to 1k for the both of them combined.,btohqsg
No idea what you're asking. They are 2 different things. The only thing is you can pair them so amaze converts all spend to online for crmc for 4mpd on eligible MCC.Amaze 1k local limit before fee.Crmc 1k for bonus points.,btohqsg
Yup  so basically  regardless of using amaze or the citi rewards card  I can only earn 4mpd for 1k max per month right?,btohqsg
yes  amaze+crmc is part of the 1k online for crmc,btohqsg
