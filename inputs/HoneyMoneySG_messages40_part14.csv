what is the advise on the credit report?,btohqsg
I went Japan- Kyushu... so far about 80% of the stores do take credit cards. Those that don't take are usually the traditional food stall  traditional shops or parking  vending machines.,btohqsg
And it is recent trip. So managed to clock using Amaze + UOB KF to clock miles and cashback,btohqsg
How much you had spent using the card although you paid it before due date?How long you have been holding the card?,btohqsg
Morning all  if I max out my $1k purchase in Japan's department store using CRMC+Amaze  the next card I should use is HSBC Revo?,btohqsg
Wa really GG. ðŸ˜…u got take any loans or not,btohqsg
Hi Guys. Are there any 3M FD promo from DBS currently?,btohqsg
Maybe should have used AMAZE with OCBC titanium at the departmental store first?,btohqsg
I don't think need amaze. I use it samsung pay tap to pay in og,btohqsg
Yah but OP in Japan.. so use amaze reduces exchange rate,btohqsg
Yes. If oversea better use. Bro can amaze link to Amex card ?,btohqsg
using amaze + crmc at dental clinic should have cashback right? did a search to find out that i will but someone told me i wont,btohqsg
Bro. How about revoul  can use for Amex ?,btohqsg
I think is possible cause able to use Apple Pay to top up,btohqsg
For the EGA fund transfer to be eligible for bonus interest  must it be transfer into or out of EGA account? If out  must it be to 5 different accounts?,btohqsg
Better don't top up anything   not allow by bank  0 miles earn,btohqsg
you need in and out  just any 5 transactions out,btohqsg
Yeah any transactions out to same account 5 time also can  all $1 also can,btohqsg
How do i redeem this? Make payment via what card?,btohqsg
Use the dbs card that you use,btohqsg
I have DBSWWMC and DBS ALTITUDE but it didnt show any payment i made that can offsetðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Another Qs is  how do i check my dbs altitude points?,btohqsg
Read up on milelion  how to check points breakdown,btohqsg
How about transactions in? Considered as one of the 5?,btohqsg
You will need at least 2k in and 5 transactions of any amount out via FAST also can. Best to do it on the start of the month. If you just start the account straightaway do it to clock it,btohqsg
Anyone heard of the promo of gwtting 40k points upon spending at least 4k for the first 60days upon getting altitude?,btohqsg
Anyone know if HSBC revolution earn 4mpd  from simply go ? From what I see  only earn 0.4mpd. just want to seek confirmation.,btohqsg
U dunt want to exchange for miles huh,btohqsg
Hi experts  can I check if I take public transport using prvi miles  since its less than 5 per transaction am I getting 1.4mpd?,btohqsg
If you always go for shopping   large items use ocbc rewards card,btohqsg
I using the visa for a month now and they only give me reward point once a month. Is batch up the $ and round down by $5 then * 1.4mpd.Iirc master card also batch up and give points but the batching is different.,btohqsg
Oh so like in a month if I spend eg. $50.5 in total they will just add all thr transactions up then round down to $50 then *1.4mpd  correct?,btohqsg
Yes thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happening for me now. You get rewarded in uni$ points so there is some rounding going onFrom milelion:â€¢ For Visa cards  fare charges are accumulated daily  but UNI$ are calculated based on theaccumulated spendon SimplyGo Transactionsper calendar month  and awarded to Cardmembers on the 7th calendar day of the following monthâ€¢ For Mastercard  your accumulated fares are posted to your credit card account every5 daysorS$15  whichever comes first.So imagine you spent S$9.99 on your UOB PRVI Miles Card. You might figure thatâ€™s 14 miles (S$9.99 @ 1.4 mpd)  butâ€¦â€¢ The S$9.99 is rounded down to S$5â€¢ S$5 is awarded 3.5 UNI$â€¢ 3.5 UNI$ is rounded down to 3 UNI$,btohqsg
Generally speaking .Only 3 cards of 4 to 6 miles recommended for n uob.1. Uob signature.2. Uob preferred visa.3. Uob lady's card,btohqsg
any good travel insurance/deals to get nowadays?,btohqsg
Hi  I am new to buying REITs  may I ask what is the difference between Mapletree Industrial Trust and Mapletree Industrial Trust A,btohqsg

Because when I saw in Moomoo there is an A at the end of it and without an A,btohqsg
Ya actually i wanna chg for miles...,btohqsg

Hi experts  I am looking to buy a proposal ring that is about 8-12k.What are the credit cards (cashback/miles  fine with both) which can maximize the benefits?,btohqsg
First thing is... Can split? If so  see if can maximise the limits for the card (e.g. 1k for HSBC revo on atome)Else pretty much see what shop  and what is accepted to see the max reward obtainable from the cards in your stash,btohqsg
