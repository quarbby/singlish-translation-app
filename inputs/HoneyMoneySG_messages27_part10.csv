I donâ€™t know why people will choose dbs multiplier   ocbc 360â€™ s interest much better,btohqsg
i also dont know why ppl will choose ocbc 360 when UOB One interest rates are much better and easier to attain,btohqsg
HSBC / RHB interest rates are EVEN higher,btohqsg
U want put in posb saving account Also can,btohqsg
End of the day is your money. Happy can Liao,btohqsg
But uob after 100000 only get 0.05%,btohqsg
Ocbc can get good interest up for your first 200000,btohqsg
if u got 200k  u should go HSBC / RHB,btohqsg
ocbc 360 is better for ppl like me who dont spend 500 on cc,btohqsg
For the HSBC revolution cc promo  would we be able to tell if it was submitted through Sing saver or normal HSBC portal?,btohqsg
Think mine went through the normal portal :(,btohqsg
I applied HSBC Revolution card on 13-Jan  approved on 15-Jan and activated on GPay with virtual card details. I just got my card earlier today.,btohqsg
My card details are all printed behind one. Is it normal nowadays?,btohqsg
Amaze tag with which Mastercard is the best?,btohqsg
Could u tell if it went through Singsaver before submitting?,btohqsg
U will receive an email. The email will require you to click the hyperlink,btohqsg
I don't know. I click on the redirected link after apply through singsaver,btohqsg
Require you to put your nric number and HP num   last 4 digit number,btohqsg
On the redemption support page  it mentioned put last 4 digit of mobile number,btohqsg
I also don't know if I got everything correct or not,btohqsg
Submit the rewards redemption form via singsaver,btohqsg
But for this HSBC way harder to hit right? Need 5 transactions. Would u think itâ€™s better to just put in T bills lock in 6 month period of interest or just put in fixed Deposit? Because weâ€™ll never know when the I.r% will be adjusted by the bank?,btohqsg
not true  all the bonus interest capped for $100k only,btohqsg
5 transactions super easy. Can just FAST $1 5x or just use hsbc credit card for 5 transactions,btohqsg
You will receive an email asking you to fill in form,btohqsg
Medical bills and insurance bill don't count for most CC?Correct?,btohqsg
Youtrip and grab pay top-up don't count as well?,btohqsg
Most of my  expense are medical bills  insurance bill and shop backWhich CC to recommend for cash back or mile?Thank you,btohqsg
Ah so as long as the rewards redemption form is submitted itâ€™s okay?,btohqsg
Sorry to ask this unrelated question  but what is the best electricity provider plan right now? Prices seems to have doubled since two years ago ðŸ˜±,btohqsg
Does anyone know if i choose monthly installment payments (i.e. for apple products) to HSBC revolution  i will be able to circumvent the $1k monthly spending limit because each month i'm only charged like $200 or so and get the max bonus points?,btohqsg
Hi  how to check the cashback from UOB absolute cash back card? those spend on Nov/early december still dont see it yet as per today.,btohqsg
End of the month at your statement  you will see the cashback. I remember my 1st month didn't reflect any and only came out on the 2nd month for myself.,btohqsg
If buy things online charge in USD  does it consider as contactless payment for thr Â§250 cashback category?,btohqsg
For what card? But in general  online is not considered contactless,btohqsg
Uob evole card  for the cashback  charge in USD,btohqsg
It will count under the online category  not contactless category.,btohqsg
Oic  i think uob evole also considered booking bus tickets and hotel bookings as online category?,btohqsg
Online is online. Contactless is when you go to a shop and use Apple Pay/Google Pay/Samsung Pay to tap at the PayWave reader,btohqsg
The MCC doesn't matter as long as it's not in the excluded MCC list,btohqsg
nope but you can sign up for secured cc,btohqsg
There's a debit card with miles (UOB KF debit card) but it isn't great. Suggest you start with cashback debit cards like SCB debit card (1% cashback)  POSB PAssion debit card (can get yuu points)  or DBS Visa Debit Card (a bit complicated to explain the cashback mechanism here),btohqsg
I think itâ€™s mentioned that monthly installment gets no rewards for all the cards. But hope someone tried and got confirm on this.,btohqsg
