the rockstar is the only thing nice that came out of mitsuoka,btohqsg
They have 4 seaters but verts only this I believe,btohqsg
Woooo time to do some research on Mitsuoka,btohqsg
Their cars all look so unique,btohqsg
Blue  black  this colour. All gorgeous,btohqsg
Put a unique styling on an otherwise common production platform,btohqsg
Yeah i love their style. but the price also nice HAHAHA,btohqsg
Slight price to pay for uniqueness things?,btohqsg
I like to see these kind but I dont dare to drive HAHAHA - E,btohqsg
I rather drive a car I am more confident in controlling. Safer for me and people on the road. - E,btohqsg
Road tax and insurance only SLIGHTLY higher than Rockstar 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg

Better say yes unless he wants a one-way ticket to heartbreak land - E,btohqsg

Yet another BMW driver with a ‘dgaf’ attitude almost hits schoolchildren at a pedestrian crossingJust when we receive sad news about that young boy who passed  we see another incident like this.Dulan or not dulan you tell me? 😡⬇️ Read the full article here ⬇️https://bit.ly/3sW4Ja0,btohqsg
And they wonder why you’re calling someone but their phones not ringing 🤣,btohqsg
Lai Liao Lai liao.. I still much prefer “Yet another [car] driver with a ……”,btohqsg
It’s almost sounding like only bmw drivers hit school children routinely.,btohqsg
unfair to the brand but anyway  its a matter of statistics i think. more bmw owners = more reckless drivers.u never ever see a reckless mitsuoka driver cos there isn't much owners anyway,btohqsg
Don’t get me wrong. I get damn stirred when I see inconsiderate drivers especially in silver or school zones,btohqsg
luxury brands get more hate too,btohqsg
Wah liddat hor haha if you want drive bmw dam scary,btohqsg
Ppl everywhere think you gonna bang them,btohqsg
How dare they not see us school children. Just because I’m short!,btohqsg
the driver couldn't even see the flashing red light stick  much less the people,btohqsg
One day when I grow up  I want to buy bmw and drive safely and SIGNAL constantly to show everyone I’m a safe driver one,btohqsg
Doesnt the normal bmws not have paddle shifters,btohqsg
