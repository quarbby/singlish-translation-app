Damn the other group is being spammed,btohqsg
There's lots of physics help available here tho?,btohqsg
Yeah but i just cant seem to kickstart myself from notes,btohqsg
It changed its name from shtuitions to ji,btohqsg
Well studying tips/outcomes and the like  everyone is different,btohqsg
Honestly yall shouldn't be too hung up about outcomes,btohqsg
Thags why i asking for tuition straight away,btohqsg
Day three im still stuck on work energy,btohqsg
To be fair normal people take 3/4 of the year to finish up to work energy (in our school),btohqsg
Wow iestin hi havent see u around for a while,btohqsg
has anyone tried the loreal infallable range,btohqsg
Eh guys  has anyone here received their uni application results?,btohqsg
For the 2020 admissions exercise  the onlineappealportalwill openfrom 2 May - 16 July 2020. Only applicants whose outcome of their applications is known (successful or reject)cansubmit theirappealsonline. In your onlineappeal  you may state your reasons for reconsideration (not more than 1000 words).,btohqsg
If you wish to appeal against the admission decision of NUS  you are required to submit an online appeal during the online appeal exercise from 22 to 27 May 2020. You may submit multiple appeals but only the last online appeal received by the closing date of the online appeal exercise will be considered.A maximum of 1000 characters is allowed for the reasons of your appeal. You are strongly advised to exercise personal planning when submitting the appeal as applying only to NUS is not a valid reason for appeals.¬† The length of the written appeal does not enhance your chances  hence it is important for you to provide a concise summary.,btohqsg
Looks like the application outcome this year like v slow arh,btohqsg
Online appeal of application result9¬†May ‚Äì¬†24 May¬†2020,btohqsg
probably because a lot of them wfh,btohqsg
Damn i must come up with a reason,btohqsg
also much more applicants this year,btohqsg
all those who want to go overseas one kena trap in sg and so some will consider going local unis instead,btohqsg
nothing to do with dragon babies,btohqsg
Uh coz ppl cant go overseas to apply,btohqsg
those guys from my batch one who may have secured a spot previously,btohqsg
Wait the appeal portal for NTU is not on the NTU admissions portal isit,btohqsg
doubt so  there are ~17 000 spots in unis this year,btohqsg
More like they can‚Äôt even fly over there maybe,btohqsg
uh its because of the covid issue and lack of proper care and measures in overseas countries,btohqsg
there are still people ik going overseas uni,btohqsg
idt it works that way for overseas uni,btohqsg
CB = 2 less months of school = Worse results = Higher cop,btohqsg
He was referring to JC COP  so worse results as in worse O Level results,btohqsg
imagine entering jc with 28 cop,btohqsg
‚ÄúDue to some reasons we are making MI into MIJC‚Äù,btohqsg
There‚Äôs people with 20-0 so u gotta consider that,btohqsg
There‚Äôs people with 0 bonus points,btohqsg
So they enter just raw 20,btohqsg
Eh ur batch alrdy got bonus rp not enough arj,btohqsg
My batch dont even have bonus rp,btohqsg
But some may not put 1st choice mah,btohqsg
huh what thing cca got bonus rp,btohqsg
So if u put 1st choice got abit of advantage,btohqsg
with bonus rp i still 5rp behind 10th percentile from my first choice,btohqsg
if they can give me +6 rp,btohqsg
i did but until now still no response,btohqsg
This one got more advantage for computing,btohqsg
just suck yourself off in text,btohqsg
dk maybe they got different criteria rubrics,btohqsg
if i wanted to waste my life,btohqsg
i can just not go uni,btohqsg
Neil u can continue to email more profs,btohqsg
i ran out of content alr,btohqsg
Wait the comp bio u want,btohqsg
Is it under fos or soc,btohqsg
Theres a fos one my friend is in that one,btohqsg
The nus president was a math prof,btohqsg
Anyway they every year increasing intake so,btohqsg
this yr scores quite siao siao,btohqsg
cs cut off alone 87.5 rp,btohqsg
Every year got ppl will drop outü§£,btohqsg
ye  my junior was 1 of them,btohqsg
Cause they go in get culture shock,btohqsg
i thought partially also cos academic rigour,btohqsg
thats why the people who remain there,btohqsg
Is either u get it or u dont,btohqsg
isnt that the point of going uni,btohqsg
u dont need to have a degree to know how to code,btohqsg
like the minds of most ppl,btohqsg
but the qualification/accreditation from the uni helps,btohqsg
cause what u learn in that CS course,btohqsg
True but cs is obviously not just coding though,btohqsg
some employers will jizz off to the name ''NUS'',btohqsg
yah but its not really that relevant also tho,btohqsg
Actually most stuff can also be lernt on the internet,btohqsg
U dont need to go uni to learn,btohqsg
at the end of the day,btohqsg
id rather they have a degree for stuff that is relevant to industry,btohqsg
ppl go uni for the cert,btohqsg
and accredited qualificaiton from a higher education body,btohqsg
Uni is generally more theoretical than practical,btohqsg
They have to prepare ppl to do further studies,btohqsg
Alot of profs dont have alot of industrial experience also,btohqsg
Hey it's important that I know how to find minimum spanning tree and sssp for my future workplace,btohqsg

Lonely people tend to gravitate together,btohqsg
How do u think jung hon got admin status,btohqsg
oh you underestimate Jung Hon  he needs no plebeian kueh,btohqsg
I helped fill the empty hole in his heart,btohqsg
And you got the extra cash/admin status,btohqsg
Except its salty like his dumblings,btohqsg
That's how we got admin status from kueh,btohqsg

I try to read from a few sources,btohqsg
Govt backed newspapers balance with the against govt toc,btohqsg
I wonder why tho  both owned by Govt but why ST Angkat more than CNA,btohqsg
I feel like TOC joined the dark side,btohqsg

Singapore residents will receive another reusable mask - with better bacterial filtration - towards the end of the circuit breaker period  says Minister Chan Chun Sing.Singapore also restarted local production of surgical masks earlier this year.Read more:https://cna.asia/2W5KbMC,btohqsg
Why bacteria filteration and not virus filteration,btohqsg
Hmm i guess during pilot they found smth hahahah,btohqsg
Isn't like a virus damn small,btohqsg
To filter it its like n95 level right,btohqsg
Great  my specs are gonna fog up even more,btohqsg
No  even N95 pore size can't filter virus particle,btohqsg
But the virus don't usually come by themselves  they come in a droplet with the mucus etc  which can be filterered,btohqsg
i thought they say normal mask is enough to filter covid 19 particles cuz its quite big,btohqsg
i see his name so often,btohqsg
Can filter the water droplet containing the virus  not the virus itself I think,btohqsg
Which is more impt than virus itself,btohqsg
Obv u gonna call lorry to transport,btohqsg
Xenon has been typing a novel,btohqsg
"OK so recently I noted two cool things in paradesIn parades  there will usually be a ""colour party"" that holds the colours (flags) representing the contingents/units/groups/whatever.Whenever the parade hormats (salute) someone  only the appropriate colours will be lowered. Eg if you're saluting chief of army  you don't lower the national colours  but if you hormat the president then all colours are supposed to go down.Second cool thing is that when someone is being hormat'd right  there will be different songs playing to signify the kind of honour given. Idk the name of the songs  but usually it's just a short 10 sec jingle. Eg chief of army/navy/Air force gets a song  chief of defence force gets another song  prime minister gets another song.The interesting part (to me) is that the song for the president is the national song  so the hormat lasts for like 2 mins",btohqsg
Thanks for coming to my Ted talk,btohqsg
I find parades really interesting tbh,btohqsg
So in NDP  there's no segment to play the national song,btohqsg
Cause when people welcome the president the national song will be played,btohqsg
You hormat with your sword tho,btohqsg
there are 7 salute tunes for different rankings,btohqsg
the salute tune for the president is the national anthem,btohqsg
haha ya but i only rmb playing salute 2 and 6,btohqsg
I wanted a list of marches also,btohqsg
I would think that salute 6 and 7 would be more common,btohqsg
bold of you to assume we all take physics,btohqsg
do you know what is salute 1 used for,btohqsg
hv no clue but the comment says president inauguration,btohqsg
I'd imagine it be used other places too,btohqsg
can't be the president come to any parade and then suddenly need play national song,btohqsg
... or maybe that's why the president only joins the ndp lol,btohqsg
Ability to deal with my shit,btohqsg
maybe his mum loves him coz he make dumpling and shares with her,btohqsg
I was planning on making a cake for my mom's birthday,btohqsg
i havent eaten dumplings for  4days,btohqsg
So I prepared for the two days before that,btohqsg
In the end someone sent her a cake in the morning,btohqsg
seems like u arent the only kid,btohqsg
I always bought it cause it filled me up,btohqsg
Add more mashed potatoes to fill you up,btohqsg
i would eat KFC  MCdonald  Popeyes  Texas Chicken,btohqsg
I got it every time I went to Bishan,btohqsg
But they put a lot of stuff,btohqsg
haha right outside the MRT station,btohqsg
I just wanna eat smth filling,btohqsg
Its not nice but i got ingredients that can make it nice,btohqsg
Stuffd is nice if you pick correctly,btohqsg
u know got one time when i queue up,btohqsg

serangoon one hard to find  must wal inside,btohqsg

Anyone who calls Mathematics 'Maths' is untrustworthy,btohqsg
and almost 98.98% not a mathematician.,btohqsg
I recommend you publish in 2 journals,btohqsg
O wait btw the only other acceptable 'Mathematics' is Math√©matiques,btohqsg
Make sure you accent that e,btohqsg
"Don't ask me how they read l'IH√âS. I read it as ""Ai Hess""",btohqsg
Or maybe i cant become a teacher,btohqsg
What's AT CG? I only know what's an AT4,btohqsg
This one everybody pronounce wrongly at first nvm one,btohqsg
Even different profs pronounce it differently,btohqsg
Bruh when you rely on profs for proper pronunciation you are a g0ne case,btohqsg
I nvr say we should rely on profs what,btohqsg
I just said diff profs read it differently,btohqsg
My dad called quarantine as quaran-tine as in time,btohqsg
This is relevant hence not advertisinghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xp4F1h0YZM,btohqsg
Ur batch lucky no need learn loci,btohqsg
My batch lucky i am not lucky,btohqsg
Why dunnid? bruh loci is the set of all points fulfilling condition X,btohqsg
H2 math new syllabus no have mah,btohqsg
I think he meant complex loci eqn,btohqsg
What loci u all thinking about lol,btohqsg
Loci in general is in h2 maths,btohqsg
To be fair  that definition is a very general definition if you think about it,btohqsg
Although it hardly ever comes up,btohqsg
Maybe ill encounter it in eng maths,btohqsg
Quite cancerous at times also the qn,btohqsg
And catch it with a masterball,btohqsg
I think it is worse than de movire theorem most of the time,btohqsg
If you word 'locus as set of points fulfilling some conditions' this definition is WIDER than what is an 'Algebraic Variety',btohqsg
I skipped the loci question during FM A Levels,btohqsg
I skipped complex ques part for h2 maths,btohqsg
It is in old h2 math syllabus,btohqsg
De movire is in maths1 module iirc,btohqsg
Time to do fmaths also then,btohqsg
Every subject that i have not taken in jc,btohqsg
Engineering math cover lots of fmath content,btohqsg
More like FMaths covers engineering maths content,btohqsg
Can easily talk about big stuff,btohqsg
Time to steal ur stuff from bedok,btohqsg
U can download further pure mathematics book,btohqsg
Pro tip: He doesn‚Äôt actually live in Bedok,btohqsg
If u need multivariable calc notes,btohqsg
I think MH1810 notes are avaialble online coz is a basal module,btohqsg
But let me settle physics first,btohqsg
The notes are from nus MA2104 though,btohqsg
Anyway most of engin Multivar calc is generally speaking 'more numbers' and 'more algebra',btohqsg
Ya engine math is nvr about proofs,btohqsg
In general terms most engin math don't go into how/why multivar is NOT Single Var but in dimension N,btohqsg
Basically all I'm saying is  engin math (esp. undergrad) is just Single Var Calc in N dimensions,btohqsg
Hardest stuff they do is triple integrals,btohqsg
O but when you go grad school,btohqsg
All the kid gloves come off,btohqsg
hi is it possible to set alarm using laptop,btohqsg
I think Google have the answer,btohqsg
ATCG as in Adenosine Thymine Cytosine Guanine?,btohqsg
THAT IS LIKE THE EASIEST PART OF BIO,btohqsg
The person don't even take bio in sec sch,btohqsg
By any chance is that person a physics god?,btohqsg
But no idea how she gonna survive other mods,btohqsg
Bio and physics are diametrically opposed,btohqsg
The more links to bio i see,btohqsg
My entire course is on that,btohqsg
in case later I cannot get back on my main,btohqsg
cause my maid will be confiscating my phone as punishment for not finishing lunch,btohqsg
So I just checked out the A level study grp,btohqsg
Tbh even if they didn‚Äôt understand  can use logic to read the table what,btohqsg
What is so difficult about that part.,btohqsg
Damn im middle and i cant afford maid,btohqsg
i rather not have maid at least not this maid,btohqsg
Pass me the fmaths notes too,btohqsg
