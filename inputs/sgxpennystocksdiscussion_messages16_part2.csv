Good morning Result note *4QFY8/20*Stock code: *Top Glove Corporation  ‚Äì  TOPG MK*Recommendation: *Add* - maintainedTP: *RM10.00* - raised (17x CY22F P/E)*Key highlights of the note :*‚Ä¢ *4QFY8/20 net profit* came in at a robust *RM1.3bn (+1 513.9% yoy)*  bringing *FY20 net profit to RM1.9bn (+403.8% yoy)*. This was *above expectations at 117% of our and 122% of Bloomberg consensus estimates.*‚Ä¢ The strong 4QFY20 results was thanks to strong global demand owing to Covid-19 leading to *increases in both sales volume (+5% qoq)*  *average selling prices (ASPs  +78% qoq)* and higher economies of scale.‚Ä¢ TOPG announced an *interim dividend of 8.5sen/share*  bringing FY20 dividend to *11.8sen/share*  within expectations.‚Ä¢ We expect TOPG to continue record *stronger results* in upcoming quarters backed by: i) *further substantial ASP hikes*  ii) *higher sales volume*  and iii) *better economies of scale*.‚Ä¢ TOPG has continued see *strong order visibility* (sales lead time for nitrile gloves [NBR] is *18 months*; natural rubber gloves [NR] is *13.3 months*; vinyl gloves is *8.3 months*; and surgical gloves is *3.6 months*).‚Ä¢ Given the earnings beat in 4QFY8/20  we *raise our FY21-22F EPS by 95-178%*  to account for *higher-than-expected ASPs*. We input a *higher ASP hike* in *FY21 (+75% yoy)*  followed by a more gradual *decline in FY22-23 ASPs (yoy decline of 22%-35%)*.‚Ä¢ In tandem with our EPS hike  our *TP is raised to RM10.00*  based on *17x CY22 P/E* ( in-line with its 5-year mean) as we roll over our valuation year.‚Ä¢ Based on our forecast  we expect *FY21 dividend yield* to stand at *8.3% (at current share price)* based on a *50% dividend payout ratio (existing dividend policy)*. This is assuming no upside to its dividend policy or a special dividend.*Link of the note:*https://resmail.cgs-cimb.com/e/763223/33-CEBD-4537-A54E-974C29D2E185/8x4ddl/240152489?h=cQ2Uc26glOlq8gQKbgfG66O5tcu5BmpxQrcxEzQG-W4Please let me know if there are any questions!Warm regards Walter Aw  CGS-CIMB Research,btohqsg
*Sembcorp Industries ($1.31) - Need to sharpen focus (Add  TP $1.95)*We factor in lower equity base and fair value loss of c.S$1.1bn in SCI post SMM‚Äôs deconsolidation. Our NAV stands at S$1.77 and S$1.95 for FY20-21F. We think clearer communication to be a ‚Äòmore focused‚Äô group could restore investor confidence while restructuring is a medium-term catalyst.Our TP is also adjusted to S$1.95  now based on 1x CY21F group P/BV  in line with the expected improved ROE of c.11.8%.
