It is not if you have a 50-60k coe,btohqsg
but when u pay what 160k for a fresh 10 years,btohqsg
and most dont even look well maintained,btohqsg
When your coe pqp is 107k alr. Its different vs paying eg 120k for a fd2r with 20k paper,btohqsg
exactly i feel that its all damn overpriced,btohqsg
Its not the car that is overpriced for the 86/brz,btohqsg
1 dollar is a dollar too many,btohqsg
okay looking at the ARF also  its abit ridiculous,btohqsg
30k in ARF  end of 10 years is 15k rebate,btohqsg
most are renewed a few months ago,btohqsg
stock okay  modded tastefully with high quality mods is okay,btohqsg
but u see some w half done bodykits,btohqsg
plus boxer i believe do require a certain amount of care,btohqsg
Heng mine is not liddat lor,btohqsg
urs is a good example of a properly modded,btohqsg
like uk what u r doing,btohqsg
some of them is like the diffuser is for quad exo,btohqsg
but they nvr change the tips end up is 2 single tips,btohqsg
"Tbh i tot i would be pretty sick of it. But its quite the ""cheerful car"" people will compliment  thumbs up and it makes people's day",btohqsg
Which my all black brz didnt have any of.,btohqsg
its nice la  but wrap and decals will be nicer imo,btohqsg
Tbh a quick paint job 1+k can respray back alr. Cheaper than wrap and look/last better,btohqsg
Tbh i not a fan of wrap cos doesnt have that deep effect if you polish it up,btohqsg
the black parts are paint too?,btohqsg
Good thing my rickshaw is powered by higher capacity human  5.5 litres of blood usually,btohqsg
Apparently only 1 of 2 factory trd 86,btohqsg
yeah.. panel gaps are huge  lots of dirt deposit in between panel and bodykit,btohqsg
Hahaha noe then u mention it. The panel gaps do look a little uneven,btohqsg
But anyway at 160k. It is a tough price to swallow but like u said paper is already 115k,btohqsg
Not like the fd2r like what clement said,btohqsg
I dont think this is a bubble. Cos coe will not crash  it will just gradually drop.and the used car market will just drop together.,btohqsg
Last time Evo only 6 7k depre,btohqsg
Ya last time coe cars had no value,btohqsg
Market shifted within 2 to 3 years,btohqsg
I think as coe price goes up  people start to consider coe cars.,btohqsg
You‚Äôre stuff that legend‚Äôs made of.,btohqsg
who need intake when u got bigger gaps for increased airflow,btohqsg
Tesla service vehicle is a Ford üëÄüëÄ,btohqsg
Morning! I‚Äôm super late as usual haha but also encourage you to have a good think about the very good and well meaning advice from the folks here - much as often it isn‚Äôt what we want to hear. To sum up what all the guys have been saying (and we all did this too at some point in our lives)  look at what the freelance or gig economy can offer you on top of your usual job. The freelance economy is here to stay and its growth was accelerated during Covid. It saved many people‚Äôs livelihoods (PHV  delivery worker all forms part of this sector). Find something that works for you. for example take a look atfreelancezone.com.sg,btohqsg
There are many resources out there you can tap on for sure. Whatever you do just don‚Äôt dig another hole to fill a hole like take a loan from someone else. a common car loan situation like yours where the loan remaining is higher than market value is still possible to get out of with some hard work. Imagine the housing crisis in the US back then when property values crashed and banks called for top ups which many who over committed and primarily lived their lives on credit and monthly paycheck to paycheck couldn‚Äôt do.,btohqsg
That is a very good hint towards buying with more head than heart.,btohqsg
@xhao_xzxA lot of messages above but i think if u must have the car for your day job  try to cover the cost with lalamove and others like what the rest have suggested. Every little bit counts. And if your pay has been cut to 2k plus  i think u full time lalamove might be abke to earn more. I have a contact for food delivery as well  fixed timing every weekday  that alone can cover the car costs. Let me know if u want.,btohqsg
Above suggestions is based on no choice but to keep the car  be it for day job or to avoid huge losses.,btohqsg
Any guess what kind of scam is this ü§£,btohqsg
Sexual scam  he wants to invite u to his house for soccer‚Ä¶ hahaaa,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt you have a missus who‚Äôs buying you a subie?,btohqsg
