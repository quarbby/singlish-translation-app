i see online that QS is just a benchmark for the research done by profs for the school,btohqsg
high qs dont mean good teaching staff,btohqsg
but now it’s taking teaching more into account afaik,btohqsg
i heard the slides for ntu,btohqsg
is the same since the 90s?,btohqsg
teaching is way harder to judge compared to research tho,btohqsg
main issue is how they read off the slides without giving 0 fucks abt the student,btohqsg
and they can’t attend classes from everywhere,btohqsg
my profs weren’t like this la so no comment,btohqsg
"""u guys are uni students now  u guys should do your own reading before coming to class""",btohqsg
idk but i hear this alot,btohqsg
the complaints i hear is almost always from engineering side one,btohqsg
not wrong but just... makes the students wonder why they pay sch fees to teach themselves,btohqsg
legit u come or no come class is the same,btohqsg
downside is if the prof writes something out of the camera u cant see,btohqsg
ntu physics i’ve had zero issues like that,btohqsg
no clue how they rate teaching for qs rankings,btohqsg
i can give the full story on that considering i was involved lmao,btohqsg
i also made the ntu homeless sticker pack,btohqsg
Kuro Sama did u know si yan lost to me once,btohqsg

The one you'd said eng dub and jap sub,btohqsg
by right hall points means rec list and you get priority in securing hall. then that year somehow all the high pointers also cmi  y2 students cmi  worst of all half the international students didn’t get a place and were asked to move out by a certain day,btohqsg
like international students always got priority then suddenly on short notice they’re asked to find some other accommodation,btohqsg
their reasoning was covid then cannot occupy any room wtv but there were so many empty ones or like they at least should allocate more to internationals la,btohqsg
i also didn’t get even tho i’m on rec list btw,btohqsg
international student no place to stay,btohqsg
then one of my friends started the ntu homeless tele channel to try and make some changes,btohqsg
so they contacted mothership at first then other news outlets,btohqsg
eventually managed to spread to straits times,btohqsg
then at first ntu office is like ok international students get more time to find new accommodation,btohqsg
eventually they finally let them stay but by then a lot of them alr found accommodation alr,btohqsg
