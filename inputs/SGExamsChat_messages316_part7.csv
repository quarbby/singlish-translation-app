Ok now gg back to sleep HAHA,btohqsg
Update if u manage to get in lol,btohqsg
And also what sch is it,btohqsg
Based on the Reddit jae thread looks like the COP of a lot of sch falling,btohqsg
Lol so u not sleeping now,btohqsg
If anyone just got near the cut off from the previous year and got accepted pls contribute if ur ok,btohqsg
I see JAE results have just been posted,btohqsg

If i appeal to a different stream in my assigned jc and itâ€™s unsuccessful  does my current posting become invalid?,btohqsg
Example i get into acjc sci and I appeal to switch to acjc arts (meet cop) but appeal isnâ€™t successful  do I still have my initial posting to acjc sci?,btohqsg
You can call the sch to maybe double confirm but idt it can just become invalid after unsuccessful appeal,btohqsg
if thats the case idt anyone will dare to appeal lol,btohqsg
Youâ€™ll have to choose your subject combi in the portal first  after the results of it are out you can appeal,btohqsg
I hope you kids got the allocation you preferred!,btohqsg
anyone watching Beijing Olympic opening ceremony?,btohqsg
Guys  I have something to ask you allWhoever is studying in RP yet has already gone for internshipWhat would happen if I forgot to ask my company supervisor for Company Stamp and I straightaway submit the workbook?,btohqsg
hey guys is it possible to appeal from arts to sci stream within the same school (acjc if knowing the sch helps)? what happens if thereâ€™s no more vacancies in the sci stream? will you kena stuck in the art stream and forced to take 2h2 arts subjects? asking for a friend thanks in advance,btohqsg
ofc she met the cop for the sci stream but she didnâ€™t get in,btohqsg
What r the odds of appeal being successful for 12raw 8nett ( affiliation + cca ) for a sch with a COP of 8 for science stream?,btohqsg
For Acjc youâ€™ll be forced to enter an arts stream combi inside (youâ€™ll have to put in 2H2 arts) the portal first. When they give out the subject combi allocation you do not sign the paper to say you accept the subject combi  and there would be an area set up where you can go to to appeal to change your subject combi. Thatâ€™s where she can appeal to switch to the science stream,btohqsg
If thereâ€™s enough vacancies they should allow,btohqsg
What combi does she intend to take?,btohqsg
Hmm I see. Good luck with the appeal then. What was the raw tho?,btohqsg
I think if itâ€™s like 10 itâ€™s even more likely theyâ€™ll accept the appeal,btohqsg
omg thank you so much for the detailed reply,btohqsg
I mean if this comforts your friend I heard of a case where a student only met the arts stream cut off  wanted to do hybrid with 2H2 science (which is considered a sci stream combi)  but she put inside the portal 2H2 arts with one H2 science and one H1 science  then during the appeal period she was able to change it to 2H2 sci and one H2 arts and one H1 arts,btohqsg
Although thereâ€™s no guarantees your friend can switch I think the chances should be quite high,btohqsg
Since she met the cut off,btohqsg
whattt  was her intended combi super unique?,btohqsg
But ofc if the person who only met the arts cut off wanted to switch to a full science combi with 3H2 sci I think itâ€™s quite unlikely theyâ€™ll allow,btohqsg
Not sure tho I only heard from a friend but basically she wanted to do 2H2 science with one H2 arts and the H1 being arts also. But if you enter via arts stream by right thatâ€™s not allowed,btohqsg
So if want to do 2H2 sci have to appeal,btohqsg
yeah okie iâ€™ll let my friend know to be safe and just appeal,btohqsg
But make sure she is clear that appeals are only done after the subject combi allocation results are out so in the meantime have to put an arts combi inside the portal first and hope for the best during the appeal afterwards,btohqsg
btw are you a j2/j3 in acjc this year or what,btohqsg
But I considering voluntarily retaining to change subject combi lol but they still havenâ€™t tell me whether I can yet,btohqsg
are you switching stream as well? or just certain subjects,btohqsg
so that means thereâ€™s a chance youâ€™ll join our batch?,btohqsg
I think theyâ€™ll only tell me if can retain next monday,btohqsg
You also got posted to Acjc?,btohqsg
but i got into sci stream already hehe,btohqsg
Is there a requirement/criteria to retain to change sub combi too?,btohqsg
I personally regretted joining Acjc but I hope yall have a good experience there,btohqsg
Have to not meet the promo criteria lor. If you want to retain but your results good enough to promote have to appeal,btohqsg
omg please let me know if you donâ€™t mind sharing ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ i wanna mentally prepare myself for sch,btohqsg
Itâ€™s either promote advance or so bad itâ€™s forced to retain,btohqsg
Discuss via pm if u rly want to ask about more,btohqsg
