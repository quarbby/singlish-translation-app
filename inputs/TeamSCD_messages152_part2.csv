I have a question. Can someone explain to me  what is the actual definition or meaning when one ram/ramp someone's car.,btohqsg
Idk ram or ramp la. Whatever it is.,btohqsg
Because someone is spreading false information about me raming or ramping someone's car. So i want to make sure i  or that person knows the proper definition of what it actually means.,btohqsg
in that context should mean bang,btohqsg
like u hit their car or smth,btohqsg
So i hope whoever that sees this message. Better keep their fucking mouth shut before i make it into a big fussEVERYWHERE,btohqsg

Just saw Singapore car in BKK 😱,btohqsg
Ya 😂 damn solid  jam like siao,btohqsg
ppl who say things about ppl not affording things and other stuff like thgat are stupd,btohqsg
Haha obviously knows nothing  Evos and S2Ks cost so much more than most European cars now 😂,btohqsg
but depends on where u live,btohqsg
This is cos of Supply and Demand  those JDM cars have stopped production long ago,btohqsg
alot of euro cars stop prod long ago no>,btohqsg
You need to compare similar cars that came out at similar times,btohqsg
One major advantage is JDM cars have smaller engines compared to European Ms and AMGs which do well in current climate,btohqsg
Another thing is most JDM cars produced are RHD and u can’t drive them in nations like the USA so LHD variants more rare meaning they go for way more esp since 70% of countries use LHD,btohqsg
Doesn't matter the reason. The main point is it is ignorant to assume all Japanese cars are cheap without any knowledge.,btohqsg
That’s why Australia got so many mk 4s,btohqsg
This is wrong esp since jdm cars don’t depreciate as badly as European. Can’t say Japanese cars are cheap they are amazing,btohqsg
That guy commented that to troll and you guys getting triggered over it is exactly what he wants,btohqsg
why not just ignore the comment and be happy with what you drive.,btohqsg
That's why my car is both JDM and euro,btohqsg
I'm perfectly happy with my cheap japanese COE shitbox,btohqsg
