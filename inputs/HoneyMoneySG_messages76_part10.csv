Campaign are one off not always ,btohqsg
Mine was 5k spend for 150 lol,btohqsg
If u your BTO is up  and need to pay for renovation which need to pay by cash  instalment to buy kitchen appliances no wrong right? Coz not everyone has 100k cash In the bank to pay everything with cash.,btohqsg
looks like 10% bonus to me,btohqsg
How you count 7.5%? I just spent $1500 under this campaign yesterday  should get $150 cash rebate = 10% not 7.5%.,btohqsg
As I say pros and cons. I never say is wrong,btohqsg
Yes  according to SingSaver redemption email you should have received the redemption code between 20-22 November for qualifying applicants,btohqsg
Oic. I use iPhone pro max $1999 as an example. 150/1999 = 7.5%If you bought cheaper iPhone  can get 10%.,btohqsg
I suggest you give them a call if you are free rn  you don‚Äôt usually have to wait when calling in the morning,btohqsg
I don't have any credit cards. I opened HSBC EGA and UOB ONE/STASH/LADY accounts to put FDs previously. Not sure what to do with these accounts and I don't know anything about rebates and cashback. So these accounts are just dormant with the minimum balance inside. How can I make full use of them if I don't intend to get credit cards? Thanks,btohqsg
I gave them a call and they told  me that it will take up to the 30th nov to get the code,btohqsg
Ah okay  the redemption form must be submitted by 5 December according to SingSaver,btohqsg
Good financial planning is not to spend unnecessary money on expensive stuff when there are cheaper alternatives,btohqsg
my last iphone was iphone 6 my friend..And my mother approved of me to buy new phone.Thank you for your kind concern.Hahaha,btohqsg

Lets stop with all the judgement and move in the direction of helping someone to make better of their finances. By taking a step forward to join the group and dare to ask questions is already a form of courage. More constructive feedback is encouraged.,btohqsg
This group so hostile ? Can humiliate people without getting banned ?,btohqsg
Hello  I want to check for Medisave top up should be done end of this year 31 Dec right? Not 1st Jan 2024,btohqsg
Anyone faced this issue with webull?,btohqsg
When trying to access moneybull wallet,btohqsg
Does anyone have any experience using Kris+&UOB ladies to pay EU holidays? Did you get the bonus UNI$?,btohqsg
You do not need to justify to anyone how you spend your money. I have 2 perfectly functioning mobile phones a Pixel 7 and iPhone 15 Pro all paid full price btw. People should just mind their own business,btohqsg
what you could do  if nobody replies you (sorry i don't know too) is to ask EU holidays to let u pay $10 with Kris+ first..Then you immediately live chat with UOB CSO to confirm if MCC is 4722  then make the mega payment.,btohqsg
Some are helping to give advice but that sugar daddy remark was uncalled for  should be given warning,btohqsg
Mcc different and only get based point  just pay directly with uob lady,btohqsg
Agree. Or outright banned. That is downright sexual harassment and certainly unsolicited ‚Äúadvice‚Äù,btohqsg
call them. I also didn‚Äôt receive SMS. they need to check ur eligibility and their product manager. I called them on 22 Nov  they called me back ytd on 27 Nov. Now waiting for them to send the reward SMS.,btohqsg
"I have deleted all the unnecessary comments regarding ""sugar"".We are all adults here  no need to resort to name-calling just because someone's financial lifestyle does not match yours.Also  we are a gender diverse group  so do not past such sexist remarks which makes other people feel uncomfortable or even insulted.I entrust my admins to moderate the chat on my behalf. Repeat of such behavior will be outright ban.",btohqsg
Money/credit is just a means to an end. So you scrimp and save for 50 years till retirement  you also do a thorough needs analysis whenever you are required to spend 10 cents over budget. You are going to lead a miserable life and your partner (if you can find one) would probably distance themselves from you. My father is one such person and I can tell you his wife is miserable every day.,btohqsg
Just use your money to buy things you value. And no one can tell you what value is. Some people value experiences (vacation) some value electronic gadgets  some value being pampered (hair salon  spas  etc). And some people just like seeing their money grow so they buy financial products. But there is no wrong way to spend your money. You do you  don‚Äôt let others tell you otherwise! üëç,btohqsg
Sorry just one more qns for the moneybull sign up promo. Do I need to convert my SGD to USD to fulfill the 3k USD equivalent?,btohqsg
No worries your father thanks you too üëç,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt try temporary because I want it to be permanent. üòÖ,btohqsg
Same. After around 2 weeks  I called them and they told me that I wasn‚Äôt successful. Lol.You can enquire your status with them. CIMB customer service damn nice and fast.,btohqsg
Any reason your application is failed? Mind to share with us?,btohqsg
I asked for a reason  but they cannot disclose it. They did suggest to build up or maintain my credit score and try again in 6 months interval.,btohqsg
So far  CIMB  HSBC and Citibank rejected me. UOB  SCB and Trust Bank gives me damn low credit limit. DCS gives me a reasonable credit limit.UOB  to me  is the hardest when trying to cancel card.,btohqsg
I just called and they mentioned usually application will only take 3 working days but mine still in processing,btohqsg
Then  don‚Äôt lose hope yet‚Ä¶ I think they are overwhelmed with a huge amount of people applying.Happened to me when I opened a savings account with them  almost a month of processing to activate the account and that is after I called and asked them to expedite.,btohqsg
Better yet buy the iPhone using credit card in HK and save on GST plus get miles or cash rebate. I bought my iPhone 15 there too,btohqsg
Buy at istudio when fly off get tax free plus cc benefit haha. Just need to contact them to get the model inside the terminal that u fly out,btohqsg
Istudio don‚Äôt have all the models like pro max 1TB,btohqsg
Haha that why i say contact them before fly off to get stock u want in. Not all will get 1 TB bah plus can get point on changi reward app,btohqsg
HK is dual physical sim card right.. cannot support esim?i did the maths.. what was your number for u to conclude buying in HK is worth it (i think it was like $50 cheaper based on my maths),btohqsg
remember in singapore  you can earn more miles and rewards especially if you buy at challenger can use kris+ or buy at krisshop,btohqsg
Istudio also have kris + and no forex feeüòÅ,btohqsg
"I have question regarding UOB visa signature ü§î On terms and condition  they state:""You will earn UNI$1 per S$5 spend on SimplyGo (ABT) based on the accumulated spendon SimplyGo (ABT) Transactions per calendar month and awarded to you on the 7thcalendar day of the following month.""and thereafter""With effect from 1 March 2022  UNI$ will no longer be awarded for transactions withtransaction descriptions ‚ÄúTRANSIT*‚Äù and ‚ÄúAMAZE* TRANSIT*‚Äù.""So... does simplygo transactions still earn Uni$? bc if they did not remove the former clause ü§îü§î",btohqsg
Simplygo does not fall unde transit i think  seperate description. Transit usually mean top up on ezlink card,btohqsg
ooh  so I still can use for simply go and clock uni$ right? ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Yes but visa signature need 1k to get 4mpd reward  there are better card for simply go,btohqsg
