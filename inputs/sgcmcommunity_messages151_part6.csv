Soya milk spilled! HaisAnyone has a great idea to eliminate the odor besides charcoal n baking soda?,btohqsg
Baking soda is actually very effective for these kinds of things. If the fabric bits is not wet  then you can just wipe your mat and pour an even (decently thick) layer of baking soda and leave there for about 2-4 hours. After that  just vacuum it up and you should be good as new! Otherwise you can try those extractor cleaners but don't spend too much money  can try and get a detailer who has one to do it,btohqsg
Hope it's thick enough plus the charcoal hippo,btohqsg
Alrdy jet spray clean the mat yesterday,btohqsg
Waaa lol ok later i do again,btohqsg
It's a waste of baking powder but it's worth it,btohqsg

It may help  but might not do much also,btohqsg
