"The metrics that we're recording is in kilograms for weight  and centimetres for height; so if you're doing the survey on your phone you will need to key in for example  ""67"" for weight and ""160"" for height:)",btohqsg
If it's not too much trouble is it ok if you can take a screenshot of the error and private message me? So that I can understand better why you're not able to proceed😅,btohqsg

Helping out a friend. Very interesting. Could benefit many of us as caregivers.We're from CoverCare and we're hoping to develop an insurance product that will allow independent Singaporean workers to access a cash payout when they are too sick to work  or can’t work because they have to look after a loved one. Our primary motivation is to improve the economic security of workers. But we expect to be able to have a positive impact on workers health and well-being. More broadly  we think there will be flow-on benefits for public health and productivity.We're currently running a survey of 'own account workers' in Singapore - basically anyone who works but doesn't have sick leave benefits. This will help us assess the needs of the community and their appetite for insurance. We will give away S$40 prizes to five lucky (randomly selected) survey respondents after the survey closes on 31st March.https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/TeamCC_SG,btohqsg
