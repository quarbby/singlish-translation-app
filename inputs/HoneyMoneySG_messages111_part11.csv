Alamakâ€¦. I top up 150k on 15th May. Means I wonâ€™t get 1000 bonus for rising phoenix promo?,btohqsg
Like that look like better I empty my account today?,btohqsg
Your Mar MAB is 0 right? You registered in May right?,btohqsg
March I got 1K. May top up 150K,btohqsg
Balance now is 151K. Basically register in 15th May,btohqsg
Then wait for earmarking in Jun...,btohqsg
I just found out that the uob ladyâ€™s card UNI$ split into 3 parts.Base UNI$ per transaction.Bonus UNI$ at start of next month.Bonus UNI$ for $10000 in ladyâ€™s account is at 27th of next month!Any experts can confirm this?,btohqsg
Next month. I thought already effect in May already,btohqsg
Guys and ladies. Need help on this . If I have biz boarding pass in Dec. Can I enter one world lounge in T1 or 2 ?,btohqsg
Your boarding pass is from which airline?,btohqsg
Is SQ in One World alliance?,btohqsg
Yea May start  bonus receive on June.,btohqsg
That is what I think so. Those who bought GV movie ticket cannot enter Cathay cinema to watch movie.,btohqsg
if u registered in May  the funds will earmark sometime 3rd week jun assuming u maintain 1k+earmatk amount from 31 May till it gets earmarked,btohqsg
Ladies account don't need to keep so much $$. 10k is just enough to get 6 miles,btohqsg
But if they count by average daily balance means ((1K x15 day) +(151K x 16 day))/31day = 78K average balance? Meaning I wonâ€™t get the 1K earn mark bonus for rising phoenix ?,btohqsg
Anything is possible if you look confident enough ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Just keep 150k + Mar MAB all the way until they end earmark. Unless you say as of today you already less than 150k + Mar MAB.,btohqsg
Or no such things? Iâ€™m confuse. lol,btohqsg
already given u the full summary,btohqsg
Oh okay. Thanks a lot for the advise,btohqsg
Hi ladies.So if means even biz boarding pass can't go in one world lounge ?,btohqsg
You ask the guys liao now ask the ladies?,btohqsg
You need to have a one world biz ticket to go to one world lounge. Yours is star alliance.,btohqsg
I was literally going to ask this question as I didn't get any bonus from the savings account! thank you,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if I can apply a joint account for uob lady savings account?,btohqsg
Have to call in and find out  as it is not stated on the websites and such I assume is no. I will be applying for uob stash joint,btohqsg
Anybody knows if Citi rewards card support payment to Telco such as TPG/Simba as it is MCC 4814 on heymax and is not in the exclusion list on citi rewards,btohqsg
I been using it to pay my StarHub bills,btohqsg
I use amex ascend to pay too,btohqsg
Also if you are using StarHub star plan recurring and their buy now pay later it also rewarded for Citi rewards,btohqsg
No. I go to their starhub website to pay .. using ascend,btohqsg
Because I ask 3 times . They refuse to give me their payment detail. Unlike singtel will give,btohqsg
To me it doesn't matter if earn 0 miles... not a lot of $$. 40,btohqsg
Actually why not use their app ?They have a payment page ?,btohqsg
Apps last week have error. Can't log in,btohqsg
I told them . I need payment detail to pay either at citi pay all or card up. But the starhub people don't understand,btohqsg
Not surprised  alot of people dont understand u at all,btohqsg
many ppl wont understand what is citi payall or cardup,btohqsg
If I empty today from $151001 to  1001  my June Mob I need to have $151001 + $150000? To entitle the MAB,btohqsg
Making payment using citi pay all or card up.. can't understand?,btohqsg
At least when I ask singtel. They understand.  They send me payment details for payment citi pay all,btohqsg
Like I said  your Jun MAB as of today is at least 10k. If Jul's promo is based on Jun's MAB  then you need to top-up on top of Jun's MAB. Keyword is if.,btohqsg
I mean they email me my request,btohqsg
no need keep 1001   can just empty everything,btohqsg
They donâ€™t understand why donâ€™t you use 4mpd card to pay the bill directly(means you earn 4miles per dollar) but you prefer to pay additional 2.6%/2.25%/1.85% admin fee to earn 1.x miles per dollar instead.,btohqsg
I think they want to avoid the fall below fee. I kena negative value on my UOB One for not having 1k.#dp,btohqsg
You are so kind to reply.. ðŸ˜…Op isn't sui g right. I tot I am starting to see different forms of similar character.. oh no,btohqsg
How to earn miles pay starhub bill... I using amex ascend. Doesn't have also doesn't matter already. I give up asking,btohqsg
To me it doesn't matter. Those expenses that goes through Giro.. I all using citi pay all/ card up,btohqsg
