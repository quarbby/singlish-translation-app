I think this one maybe later in the month - saw that Nov SBF was announced on 28 Dec (if i'm not wrong),btohqsg
And since 21 May is BTO only  seems likely it'll be later!,btohqsg
Sbf is 6 wks.not being rude All info are stated at hdb website.,btohqsg
I do not see the date of sbf result in hdb website,btohqsg
it's ok  so the results for BTO takes 4 and SBF takes 6 weeks respectively,btohqsg
ok my mum received her SBF result on 29th Dec,btohqsg
second timers have chance to get single digit too while first timers have chance to get balloted beyond supplies,btohqsg
so all in all it's all about luck unless you're riding on MGPS and GRO schemes which may have undesired situations,btohqsg
Almost 25% of those in 45 age range have 500k or more in CPF,btohqsg
means haven't deducted for housing yet,btohqsg
don't use your DBS POSB card for now,btohqsg
Anyone applied for BTO using the priority schemes   such as parenthood priority scheme and married child priority scheme?,btohqsg
Is it the same as first timer 2 chances of ballot?,btohqsg
As your balloted queue position has far exceeded the flat supply  we regret to inform you that your application is not successful.GG,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt even get a half f number,btohqsg
it's ok go for kovan or Queenstown next!,btohqsg
Ya going to try Kovan next. If don‚Äôt get  Nov got Hougang,btohqsg
Can i ask sth  so if i get queue number this time means im invited to book a flat ady? So means if i reject now will be counted as i forfeit once?,btohqsg
Is your number within the number of units available?,btohqsg
your ballot number divided by 0.8 that's the highest ballot number to have chance for 20% as that's an average dropout rate,btohqsg
Your application has been balloted with a queue position of 279 out of 265  if dont wan will go down will get affect my chance on next balloting?,btohqsg
wont affect my next ballot chance right?,btohqsg
I got 500plus but available unit is 411,btohqsg
So was just wondering if i mamaged to ballot until amd i reject will it affect my chances,btohqsg
sorry but can you rephrase your question,btohqsg
You mean you plan to give up?,btohqsg
i mean if they call me up and left with 2nd floor  i can dont want right? will affect my next ballot chance?,btohqsg
based on your number I highly doubt that you'd only have choices for 2nd level,btohqsg
Agree! Stands a very good chance to select,btohqsg
suay suay left 2nd floor  can reject? will affect my chance next round?,btohqsg
That one you have to appeal I think,btohqsg
Even if want reject and will affect chances also bo bian ady since selected,btohqsg
0.5% dropout rate to squeeze into the selection for 279 out of 265,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why half f number sucks,btohqsg
Hi  anybody knows if let say the queue it‚Äôs 9xx out of 1010 for 4 room  u think will get good flat ?,btohqsg
at least you're in queue for selection lol,btohqsg
sorry  i lost it at your display picture...,btohqsg
take it that the average d/o rate of BTO launches is 20%,btohqsg
Im also worried about this ! Mine is 800plus leh üò≥,btohqsg
Hopefully will be not too low lv,btohqsg
I scared get lower floors sia üòÜ,btohqsg
Anybody know if got telegram group for MacPherson waves?,btohqsg
I also scared but yours shld be wont la,btohqsg
Yours within the no  still got 200 units to spare,btohqsg
Congratulations to everyone who has gotten a ballot number!!!For those who missed  it's OK! Because there is another round soon! Better luck in the next one.,btohqsg
Same here hahahah ! Going for Queenstown or else ec,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know donated how many $10 already,btohqsg
Thank u man for the assurance üôè,btohqsg
Actually hor  it's not really about the 10bucks  but rather time. Let's say on average one year got 3 bto exercises. 30$ means one year gone. If u donated 100bucks  means you have been trying for a home for 3 years plus le.,btohqsg
I donated since applying for singles 2 room until now with bf applying as a couple.. still don‚Äôt give me a number haha,btohqsg
