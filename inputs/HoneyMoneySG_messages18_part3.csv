Hi.For Tbills competitive bids  will I get the yield that I bid (assuming lower than the cut off yield)  or will it follow the cut off yield?Can use cpfsa for competitive bid?,btohqsg
Unused balance in liquidpay account cannot cash out right? Thinking of using this liquidpay app but not sure if most hawker centres are using it or not? Wait I top up already the funds all stuck inside‚Ä¶,btohqsg
You don't have to topup to use it  just add your credit card and use liquid pay to scan the QR code.,btohqsg
I have the same concern also.. not sure if the transaction will continue to my maybank platinum visa minimum spend..,btohqsg
Even if charged directly to credit card  it shows a 'nets' transaction..,btohqsg
Not sure what you meant but Amaze with CRMC is giving me 4 miles still,btohqsg
Bought ikea vouchers at jem using credit card and can even get landlease points ü§£,btohqsg
Hi  how do I pay uob Absolute statement by DBS/POSB,btohqsg
Online seem to only allow Visa/Mastercard,btohqsg
Pay Bills -> Choose UOB Credit Cards as the organisation,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for those that sign up for credit card promos on moneysmart  do yall send in the claim form after your card has been approved or after you spent 500 dollars on the card ?First time applying cc on these promo platforms so not very sure how to proceed üòÇ,btohqsg
hi guys  does this icon means that GrabPay can be used to scan this code?,btohqsg
Cut off yield if you bidded below it.,btohqsg
Ohhh so cpfsa only allows noncompetitive bid?,btohqsg
Hi! Just checking with you guys. Does shopback pay  favepay  liquid pay  etc considered online transaction?,btohqsg
Sorry  wrong info. Can use CPF sa but not worth it since sa has compound interest,btohqsg
T-bill non-compititive bids only 7% allotted ü•≤,btohqsg
It would be nice if Chris makes a video abt the NOV 2022 BTO Flats and all the eligible grant that are able to receive.,btohqsg
Ya mans! HDB grants are confusing so videos on HDB topics will be well received by viewers!@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg
ehh? got instances where grabpay cannot be used for PayNow QR?,btohqsg
Some of the government payment QR can‚Äôt. Like CPF,btohqsg
See this  like what I predicted in the T-bills video. Now Cut-off yield already less than 4%.Also CIMB come out and fight with RHB now for SGD Fixed Deposit at 4.15% p.a.!,btohqsg
Whatever that goes up must come down,btohqsg
Must compare Apple to Apple la the bank 6 mths rates only 3 percent only,btohqsg
And t bills give u the ‚Äúinterest‚Äù upfront,btohqsg
Nothing can compare to t bills for 6 mths rates for now,btohqsg
I will return to BTO videos when resources are available. Right now the challenge is always on the unknown release date that is difficult for production to execute within one week.,btohqsg
it is not upfront. You invested $98 and then get interest $2  so end of the tenure you get $100.,btohqsg
To@ChrisHMSGcredit  he had mentioned it a his earlier videos,btohqsg
