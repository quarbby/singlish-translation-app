Today received $2.50  turns out it is 25% cashback of the commission paid,btohqsg
Got the same  u receive your singsaver reward yet?,btohqsg
Nope. I applied for Tiger brokers via SingSaver in March and still haven't received. My wife applied via MoneySmart at the end of April  but already received her gift. She also applied for EGA via Moneysmart in April. I'm afraid she'll receive her give before I get it from SingSaver lol,btohqsg
Lol will keep u posted if I get it,btohqsg
A quick check. For DBS Multiplier  does recurring insurance premium charged to a dbs credit card considered as an eligible card spend?,btohqsg
If I just applied for UOB Absolute  am I unable to apply again consecutively for UOB Evol or do I need to wait for the absolute to process finish? Because they told me I recently submitted an application for this UOB product that prevents me for applying for EVOL too,btohqsg
I did like 2week intervals uob one then Evol. End up Evol got it first ...,btohqsg
Based on my personal experience  you can apply multiple credit cards in parallel.,btohqsg
I assume u mean the person ends up having a Personal UOB One account and a Joint UOB account with his/her spouse.Based on personal experience  onlyONE(1)of the two account holders of the UOB One Joint Account need to fulfill the requirements.,btohqsg
Thanks! So if this person has an individual ONE account and also another joint ONE account with their spouse  the CC spend requirement of $500 can be met by the same person concurrently. In other words  this person needs to only clock $500 instead of $1000 to meet monthly requirements for BOTH accounts. The spouse doesn't have to do anything.Please correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks!,btohqsg
Hi all gurus May I know which is the best credit card to use for car insurance?,btohqsg
Ditto … i guess singsaver promo is goner 🤣,btohqsg
Good luck getting the gift from Singsaver. It is like they are wishing you forget claiming it so they could pocket the gift from the bank.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  for HSBC promo  do I open an account for EGA first or the HSBC Revolution? Thanks alot,btohqsg
Don’t think that’s the case. I wanted to do the same. Any individual can only have 1 x UOB one account at the Primary account holder. It’s in the T&C. If you are the primary account holder of the joint One account. You cannot have another personal One account. Only the secondary account holder in the joint account can have his / her own personal One account.For UOB one CC qualifying criteria  it will be dependent on who is the primary account holder. All criteria will be tag to him / her.It doesn’t stack.,btohqsg
For insurance premiums as a whole  I use MayBank Platinum Visa. You need to clock min $300 monthly to the card to earn quarterly reward of $30. Insurance premium is one of the eligible transactions.Maybank Platinum Visa is one of the only few cards that give rewards for insurance premiums.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. I only got one Joint UOB One Account.,btohqsg
If you have one joint account only  and if your name appear first between the 2 names then u r the primary account holder. Which means the CC spending will be tagged to u for this account.What ur spouse do does not have effect on this account assume the above is the case.,btohqsg
Gd morning to all Shi Fu'sI remember last time we could see how many points were earned for each transaction in the Citibank app but now they seem to have removed such features. Anyone noticed that?,btohqsg
Just for argument sake. If thePrimaryUOB One Joint Account holder use aSupplementarycredit card to spend $500  can it be taken as UOB One's $500 eligible credit card spend?,btohqsg
yes  personally i have a supp card for my wife  yes it works. only for eligible transactions if u are referring to UOB 1 cashback,btohqsg
Ah you mean it does not meet the UOB One $500 spending criteria for bonus interest?,btohqsg
Gd qn. But I dun have experience with sup card so not able to weigh in on this one.,btohqsg
not that i know of  it only counts into my UOB One CC transactions for cashback based on my observations,btohqsg
hahaha! anyone here try this before? May be can share generally ? (:,btohqsg
sorry i wasnt following the conversation.yur question is whether supp card spendings goes into UOB One account for $500 bonus interest criteria?,btohqsg
Hey Chris! Hope you are well. Can check  to claim the reward is it just ensure to apply by 11 Jun?,btohqsg
Yes. Let me give an example so that the community here can follow better.UOB OnePersonalAccount:BobBob has a UOB One Credit Card. He gives a supplementary card to Alice (his girlfriend) and spend $550 on his UOB One Credit CardUOB OneJointAccount:Account Holder #1: Alice (Primary account holder)Account Holder #2: BobAlice spends $550 on her supplementary UOB One card.Q: CanbothUOB One Accounts (above) meet the $500 credit card spend criterion for bonus interest?,btohqsg
Let me twist the example above.Example B:UOB OnePersonalAccount:BobBob has a UOB One Credit Card and UOB Evol Credit Card. He spend $550 on his UOB One Credit Card.He gives aSupplementary UOB Evol cardto Alice (his girlfriend)UOB OneJointAccount:Account Holder #1: Alice (Primary account holder)Account Holder #2: BobAlice spends $600 on her supplementary UOB Evol card.Q: CanbothUOB One Accounts (above) meet the $500 credit card spend criterion for bonus interest?,btohqsg
If online  EGA first  then revolution. Otherwise you'll need to go down to the branch to open EGA,btohqsg
I think only primary holder gets interest  this is found in the one account t&c,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing  man. UOB smart. Already mitigated the 'loophole'.,btohqsg
Based on TnC Clause #40.11  Alice must be the main holder of the  qualifying credit card (e.g. UOB Evol). Alice can give Bob a supplementary card to spend the $600.By doing so  both UOB One accounts (Personal and Joint) and cards (UOB One and Evol) got bonus interest and bonus cashbacks respectively.,btohqsg
Anyone here has tried the below and get Bonus interest for both UOB One accounts A and B? (:ExampleC:UOB OneJointAccountA:Account Holder #1: Bob (Primaryaccount holder)Account Holder #2: Alice (Bob's wife)UOB OneJointAccountB:Account Holder #1: Mary (Primaryaccount holder)Account Holder #2: Alice (Mary's sister)Assumption: Both accounts meet the criteria (including the $500 eligible spending on one of the two qualifying credit cards criterion).,btohqsg
My understanding on UOB joint account related is UOB looks at the primary account holders. If there is spending on supplementary card  it will be treated as spending on primary card in term of calculating towards UOB one bonus belongs to the UOB one primary account holder.,btohqsg
Interesting. Seems like the answer to my example B is a 'yes'?,btohqsg
Hi guys  any recommendations for best priority account with reasons why? Will appreciate any input 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Means both Bob and Alice must have their own credit card as primary card holder and spend on each to meet minimum spending  then the two joint accounts will get bonus interest respectively.In summary  UOB trace the primary account holder(as the main) and it’s supplementary card.,btohqsg
hi anyone here still usingcrypto.comcard ?i wonder now topup via amex or amaze card still works ?,btohqsg
Thanks for explaining. Reading FAQ #5 in conjunction with TnC Clause #40.11 should give the interpretation that both Bob and Alice must hold credit card as the main cardholder and charge $500 to the credit card which they are the main card holder respectively.,btohqsg

"If direct payment IIRC is maybank visa infinite (1.2mpd)  not sure if still valid) and maybank horizon (0.4mpd). Else use cardup with eligible 1.2-1.4++mpd miles card. UOB also got payment facility to ""buy miles"" with eligible UOB miles card. SCB/citi pay bills also can.",btohqsg
