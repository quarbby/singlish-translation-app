Smaller rival Hartalega has also reported cases.,btohqsg
 thought all short positions need to be covered within the trading day...?,btohqsg
Poem allow naked short +3  that's good,btohqsg
Paiseh. I think that if no mistaken when you short and fail to cover within the same day. SGX will settle for you in T+3 and yes it come with penalty fees as well.,btohqsg
The only legit way to short and keep as long you wan should be thru borrowing shares from your broker.,btohqsg
