You can take the earlier date as a gauge. The later date is when HDB must contractually complete the BTO  failing which they have to compensate you,btohqsg

Hi guys  my HFE expiring in a month.I want to reapply HFE but it does not have any button for me to click to do that.I click on ‚Äúview/reapply HFE‚Äù but it just shows information of my loan etc. I understand that some in the group said it can only be done one month before expiry but I still don‚Äôt see how I can do that. How do I go about this?Anyone knows? üôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg
One week before then can. Do you have any upcoming flat selection?,btohqsg

Can be applied 1 mth before expiry. When ur HFE expire?,btohqsg
Is there a button for reapply?,btohqsg
Like what would I see in the portal to reapply?,btohqsg
Hi  supposing one takes a 15 years hdb loan and is able to pay off the remaining balance of the flat before the loan period is up (end of 15 yrs)  how should one go about it in terms of steps? Inform hdb? Thanks.,btohqsg
I think you can log in to the HDB portal to make the full payment,btohqsg
You can go branch office to pay off the balance loan.,btohqsg
Has anyone here tried reno package before? What was your experience like? Is it worth the $ or are there a lot of hidden costs? Thanks :),btohqsg
Have not tried before but I think is better to engage reputable ID with package for the different room types. Upon discussion what the package consists of and the prices are also firmed. Should be no hidden  cost,btohqsg
Hello  my HFE letter has not expire however it is based on 80% ltv as i applied before the new cooling measure. Do i need to get a new copy or how do i know how much loan im eligible for now?,btohqsg
Hi guys  wanted to check with you.We got a queue number for this time‚Äôs pasir ris BTO. Looking at around $735k.We are both currently students who will graduate in July 2027. The flat is expected to TOP by Q3 2028  giving us around 1 year to work and save. We are estimating a combined income of $7-$8k.During our HFE application  we applied for deferred income assessment and currently our income is $0.Would we be able to get the maximum grant of $120k before 1st downpayment and have our HDB loan reassessed 3 months before key collection?Or would the grant and HDB loan be reassessed 3 months before key collection?,btohqsg
Since is deferred  Grant and loan will be reassessed 3 month before key collection,btohqsg
besides  do note that at least 1 partner have to work continuous for 12 mths to qualify for grant,btohqsg
So if your combine income is 7-8k your grant would be much much lower than the 120k you are anticipating,btohqsg
Based on the timeline  jul 2027 and q3 of 2028  3 mths before key collection shld be about june 2028? means yall will have <12 months of working (unless alr working prior?),btohqsg
So there is a chance will not be eligible for a grant,btohqsg
We are okay with a lower grant around estimated 20-25k  but was wondering how much hdb loan would our 7-8k combined salary be able to get? Because I saw that 75% LTV of $735k is $551 250 which seems quite high for hdb to even consider loaning us that amount,btohqsg
u can use the hdb calculator to check the rough estimate,btohqsg
Grant wise just make sure continuous work for 12 months before the assessment,btohqsg
Means ideally  it would be better if one of us starts working around april 2027 for 1 year till april 2028  which is also 3 months before grant assessment (jul 2028) right?,btohqsg
E.g Assessment on June 2028  work 12 mths continuously till April 2028,btohqsg
Taken from hdb website under ehg grant,btohqsg
Normally when they say Q3  we take it as July or Aug?,btohqsg
So if only one of us manages to work continuously for 12 months  the grant and hdb loan will be assessed based on that one person‚Äôs income right?,btohqsg
Is it better to get a higher grant or a higher hdb loan?,btohqsg
In your opinion  Is it better to get a higher grant or a higher hdb loan?,btohqsg
"Me? If u can cover remaining shortfall with cash  then grant better since its ""free money""",btohqsg
Else  just get high loan üòÇ,btohqsg
So it depends on ur situation,btohqsg
was an ID for a short while! what you pay for is what you get (at least from where i was). but of course changes in materials (like tiles to vinyl) and add ons (e.g countertop material) are bound to incur additional cost. if you want to play safe  ask them to give a break down of your quotation instead of lump sum :) most of the time they provide lump sum to increase the price  or they are lazy to write more details,btohqsg
but yes pls choose reputable firms and ID! look at google reviews too,btohqsg
If you got more cash + cpf (300k ish than go for higher grant,btohqsg
If not much cash than higher loan I guess,btohqsg
When u collect key your cash+cpf+grant+loan must cover the value of the house,btohqsg
Hey just curious for BTO 5 room what's the typical Reno cost like nowadays? Say decently,btohqsg
can't give you a proper gauge cause i left the few almost a year ago. my last 5 room bto project was around 50-60k. it was inclusive of some of these:1. vinyl flooring2. tiles for balcony3. partition wall for wall niche and tv (flushed in seamlessly)4. led strips5. drop lights6. carpentry with niche hole + plugs (kitchen + bedroom)7. painting8. general cleaning,btohqsg
really depends on how much you're looking to do honestly. vinyls are usually charged $5.50 to $6.50 per sqft. tiles pricing is more standardise  $3.50/sqft usually  at most $4/$4.50,btohqsg
carpentry if you wanna do sliding door or glass door  will be pricier. casement is cheaper  but with the space constrain in bto  homeowners usually go for sliding and suck it up,btohqsg
i can't remember the rest already sorry üòÖ,btohqsg
I thought vinyl will be cheaper than tiles?,btohqsg
