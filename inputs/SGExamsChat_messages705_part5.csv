i love drinking and driving !!,btohqsg
40k ppl died by guns20k ppl died by cars,btohqsg
can anyone tell me the diff between h1 and h2 syllabus for econs,btohqsg
content wise  minimal difference  difference mainly lies in the exam format.H2 econs: P1 CSQ 30m  P2 essay qns 3 x 25m [(a) 10m (b) 15m]--> for essays  need choose at least 1 from section A & BH1 econs: 1 paper 2 30m CSQ,btohqsg
what is ur alternative and what stream you want to enter,btohqsg
but i dun think u can upgrade mid year?,btohqsg
isn't the standard like 4h2 rn,btohqsg
unless ur school allows that  coz i only heard of dropping 4h2 to 3h2 1h1,btohqsg
i never heard of the other way,btohqsg
juz get at least a b I think th let me go h2 alr,btohqsg
I heard passing in jc is q hard,btohqsg
simply put  top tier jcs  most people take 4h2 but in mid-low tier jcs  the majority is 3h2 1h1,btohqsg
wait then how u take 4h2,btohqsg
they only allow if u do well enuf,btohqsg
once I settle my 4h2 I'm gonna try get h3 chem or bio,btohqsg
tbh 3h2 1h1 and 4h2 makes no difference to the rp  it might make a difference for scholarship considerations,btohqsg
er i think just take it one step at a time  if u are concerned about passing jc  then i dun suggest going for 4h2,btohqsg
I'm sure future me will be grateful,btohqsg
and btw for econs  the way u answer csqs and the way u answer essays is very different  so the jump may be big,btohqsg
its like 1.5 months in and I only had like 4 to 6h of econs lessons,btohqsg
i mean it make sense coz there is a reason why it is called case study question  u can get clues from the case,btohqsg
i think there is a big difference between h1 and h2 distinction rates at least for my school,btohqsg
my teacher said its easier to score a for h2,btohqsg
cos dumb ppl take h2 econs and dun understand,btohqsg
he say h1 econs bell curve steeep,btohqsg
but it depends on different individuals la,btohqsg
that one i can agree coz people tend to do better in h1 econs,btohqsg
but tbh dun care too much about the bell curve coz knowing it will only cause unnecessary worry,btohqsg
im not sure about ur school but my school econs notes for h1 and h2 econs is together,btohqsg
do you even have a reason for wanting to take 4h2  h3 all those lol,btohqsg
if it is together right  then can just prep the h2 econs essay also if u really want to do h2 econs,btohqsg
but tbh taking 4h2 and h3 is kinda not really giving u an edge in anywhere,btohqsg
rn you’re spewing out reasons that don’t make sense so i’m just confused,btohqsg
i suggest dun overload urself unnecessarily,btohqsg
for 4h2 and h3 to even give u any edge in scholarships  u need to also do well in them all....,btohqsg
at least better than humanities and math,btohqsg
"""I want to go med""And""Cos idk where to go""Do not mix well together...",btohqsg
this is a really really bad reason,btohqsg
like med is one of the worst things to choose when you dk what to do,btohqsg
like ig med sch has been my goal since like,btohqsg
so like ive been set on it since,btohqsg
uhh suggestion then is look more into the path itself and talk to people that are doing it,btohqsg
know what you’d be getting yourself into,btohqsg
like i dont see myself doing better in other uni courses,btohqsg
issue with med isn’t just the uni course,btohqsg
it’s a longer commitment  work life balance  financial burden,btohqsg
dentistry is just as competitive as med la so,btohqsg
financial part is why i need scholarshipppppp,btohqsg
ok one is acads  two is portfolio,btohqsg
if you can’t secure your RP then no need think about anything else,btohqsg
