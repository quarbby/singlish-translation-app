look so nice üò≥ where was it?,btohqsg
Is it something to be concern  either bite or stung me,btohqsg
I think by one is okay unless you have allergy towards the venom.,btohqsg
Maybe I had the rice version  wasn't hot.. had a little heat but that's it.,btohqsg
Are you aware you're allergic? Is the sting still in the puncture wound? (If it's a bee  the stinger should still be there),btohqsg
If concerned  do go see a GP.,btohqsg
Slight swell is expected  you can use a cold compress & taking Zyrtec might help. But if you feel unwell  then see a doctor on the safe side.,btohqsg
Agree on that  swelling is your body's way of reacting to the venom inflicted during the sting..  the crucial bit is whether you are allergic.. and if the swelling doesn't go down or the pain worsens over time (2-3 hours) please do see a doctor as soon as you can. Don't wait till you're in serious trouble,btohqsg
