"How to get a partner during Poly Orientation!As poly orientation is starting on Monday for many of us  some may be nervous and not know what to do to acquire some bitches. Perchance. Thus  I have carefully curated a survival guide for Poly Orientation  equipped with all the social skills you need as well as some ways to impress all the hoes  and potentially get you laid (100% real strategy!)For men :1. Greet every girl with ""where my hug at?"" This will let them see your affectionate and more feminine side. Women love that! üòç2. When a girl goes to the toilet  always reply with ""Without me?"" This lets the girl know that you'll always be there for them. üòÅ3. Be sure to follow girls to class! Extra close distance reassures them that you shall protect them from the big evil alpha wolves in your group üòàüòà4. Lastly  when a girl pulls out her phone you always take it! Be sure to scroll aggressively and ask her ""where yo hoes at?"" She'll be so attracted by your protective behaviour and fall in love with you! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èFor women :1. Always talk about how small and petite you are! This lets the big sigma ohio gyatt men know that you are in need of their protection üòã‚ÄºÔ∏è2. Constantly pursue the older OGL men! They'll think you're so mature for your age üëçüëçüëç3. Ask all the boys in your group if you're ugly. Make sure to twirl your hair while doing so  and Lim Jun Jie from Diploma in Business will rush in to reassure you!! Always compliment his secondary school glory days and you'll be in a relationship in no time üî•üî•üî•Now that I've bestowed upon yall my words of wisdom  we should expect a rise in teen pregnancies nationwide. Perchance.",btohqsg
follow this to have infinite poly rizz,btohqsg
Btw siyan i surprisingly passed that exam,btohqsg
my faith was not for nothing,btohqsg
so that's one item checked off. no need to redo,btohqsg
should i do a jc edition,btohqsg
my mom was checking the bill see if they missed a dish  the fren asked to check it and my mom passed to her and say ‚ÄúÁúãËÄåÂ∑≤‚Äú lmaooo,btohqsg
i need to consult my jc friends for this,btohqsg
Josh you have a hidden talent. Keep it hidden,btohqsg
im teaching everyone how to pull,btohqsg
probs wouldn't be much diff anyway,btohqsg
In an intv workshop in jc  the workshop person (someone fr smu) told us a story where the intv was supposed to be lkc sch of biz but person reported at lkc lib,btohqsg
Lkc museum in nus  lkc school of business in smu  lkc school of medicine in ntu  lkc library,btohqsg
Then in the end they were nice enough to hv it postponed,btohqsg
Why am i getting downvoted on reddit,btohqsg
sad didnt get 86 ln cause it was out of stock,btohqsg
Lee ka shing is the rich guy from HK,btohqsg
Lee kong chian is the local rich guy,btohqsg
"gave the counter my details to contact if its in stock but the website says ""publisher has no plans to reprint"" üíÄ",btohqsg
Lkc library is in the national library,btohqsg
glance abit of sum ppl saying on reddit the battles arent very well done in the ln,btohqsg
tho i normally try not to look at reviews so i dont have a bias,btohqsg
bruh why the night weather in sg soooo hot,btohqsg
and the writer kinda drags on in some parts apparently? but its a series so its gonna sometimes feel like that ig,btohqsg
the only ln series ive read is mushouku and kumoko,btohqsg
mt i hold on q high praise tbh,btohqsg
tho kinda dropped kumoko cause it was EOY ehhh,btohqsg
i love the inner dialogue writing style,btohqsg
think i got to vol 10,btohqsg
oh i also read shield hero but despise it tbh,btohqsg
"one arc where they try to storm an island or smth and it was like ""we met enemies  defeated them easily"" like multiple times",btohqsg
until they got the the orca guy,btohqsg
it was supposed to build up to that but felt so drawn out,btohqsg
it was interesting the game-like style of collecting shields,btohqsg
and another not ln but manga i despise is tokyo revengers,btohqsg
smart casual is very broad. what's the context?,btohqsg
That guy got everything named after him,btohqsg
Bruh if u say u go LKC school ppl ask SMU or NTU,btohqsg
maybe 1 solid colour will do,btohqsg
Depends la if it's like office job I dun think it matters but if it's a front end client facing thing then no,btohqsg
Cannot.. also I am pretty sure he didn't want to be remembered and enshrined like a saint,btohqsg
Then again since when did PAP or LHL follow his wishes..,btohqsg
Ya once LWL moves out (if she‚Äôs still living there)  I hope they demolish it immediately,btohqsg
Looks like yi ny and jp principals can now compete with each other,btohqsg
Moe should‚Äôve moved this Mr Pang to a neighbourhood school to humble himself lol,btohqsg
Like he wants to turn ny into hci,btohqsg
Can tell the ny students desperately want Mr Low back,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not going to be surprised if the teachers that work for him also hate the new principal,btohqsg
Like he might be the type that bosses others around,btohqsg
I heard Acjc had a VP who was from the SAF and did exactly that  which is again why it‚Äôs a bad idea to parachute people from the military into other jobs,btohqsg
I highly respect DHS current principal,btohqsg
A lot of people used to have negative opinions of him  but he actually listen to the student body and I feel like he is someone with a very high eq,btohqsg
Maybe moe could try something like introducing a vote (but only for teachers) at the end of each year as to whether a principal should stay in the sch or go elsewhere lol,btohqsg
If even the teachers wanna kick him out he must be damn jialat,btohqsg
I got juice about that lady but can‚Äôt say it here lol,btohqsg
Nah let them satisfy their carnal desires,btohqsg
Yeah make it a secret ballot,btohqsg
Students may anyhow vote but I think teachers will think it through properly,btohqsg
My sec sch the new principal seems to be a lot better,btohqsg
Unless the principal is super good like Mr Low  the principal is gonna have to rely on the teachers to save their ass lol,btohqsg
a mini flex is that I shook the principals hand,btohqsg
during d carnival I was chillin with my friend and the principal shot water at us using a miniwatergun,btohqsg
I shook hands with my principal once I think,btohqsg
Yeah at least with such a vote the principals would be held to a higher standard and can‚Äôt have a blank check lol,btohqsg
Like he‚Äôd have to consult the chers before making decisions,btohqsg
Not force everything down upon them,btohqsg
Wait actually what happens at d carnival,btohqsg
I was just chilling with my friend building sandcastle,btohqsg
I was thinking it was a fundraiser carnival,btohqsg
But then again dhs is govt sch,btohqsg
i shook twice in one year lmao,btohqsg
sadly that was his last yr,btohqsg
once was during prize giving the other one was grad,btohqsg
eh guys yall saw the couple vid on the mrt?,btohqsg
guys what are some sg channels yall watch,btohqsg
i would occasionally watch sg travelogues by foreigners,btohqsg
what about yt channels? I got nothing to do alr..my intern supervisor told me i alr finished the goal of my internship...just 1 month in..i still got 3 months to goneed to find some things to fill up the time  my other intern friend told me he is just gonna enjoy music all day,btohqsg
what genre of yt vids yall watch then,btohqsg
"i literally watch everything if you cant tell by now. ive literally hit the yt version of ""bottom of the barrel""",btohqsg
Do you like Green Eggs and Ham?https://youtu.be/0HJuaQL3KRI?si=wBQZ5-SQzup-74hq,btohqsg
Ah lol back when the tea party existed. But it‚Äôs quite stupid that the filibuster still hasn‚Äôt been abolished yet (although it may be soon with Kyrsten Sinema and Manchin leaving),btohqsg
https://youtu.be/YkHw9dcMfoI?si=bYDYgsqcKtt4YP9hAlso reminds me of this onion video,btohqsg
This honestly would‚Äôve been pretty believable right now lol. The US congress is so dysfunctional that it‚Äôs hard to differentiate comedy from what actually happens,btohqsg
i saw the vid of a congressman talking about his wife's anniversary while the topic in congress was a ufo sighting  by a high ranking airforce personnel,btohqsg
i dont think i have ever seen a 220 irl tbh,btohqsg
For Sinema I doubt Arizona will elect a Republican. For Manchin that one is a very dicey,btohqsg
220 probly risk headbutting the ISS,btohqsg
But even still they just need to maintain 50 assuming they get the president they desire. Also it ain't like last time... McConnell is like worse that Joe with his Dementia,btohqsg
Yeah so they will need a Democratic gain elsewhere. Polls show that the Republican challenger will likely gain Machin‚Äôs seat. But tbh even if Democrats lose their majority  it‚Äôs possible that Democrats filibuster the Republican‚Äôs agenda to the point they‚Äôre so frustrated and agree to vote to abolish the filibuster with the democrats,btohqsg
Also right now some votes cannot be filibustered as in the 2010s the senate voted on some rule changes,btohqsg
? I said even with Sinema gone Arizona will probably still swing Democrat,btohqsg
I wonder who will replace McConell lol,btohqsg
U talking about the Nuclear Option?,btohqsg
Yes but then if Trump wins  and Manchin‚Äôs seat flips  it‚Äôs going to be 50-50 with republicans getting the tie breaking vote,btohqsg
shit would be a long distance relationship at 135,btohqsg
"btw ""average height"" is misleading since it includes ppl of all generations",btohqsg
When a filibuster is use. Technically it can be overwritten by the nuclear option they did it for all senate nominations,btohqsg
but cant rly find average height by age,btohqsg
u can try finding other countries and doing a rough comparison,btohqsg
Can it be used for all votes?,btohqsg
I thought that was only for confirmation votes,btohqsg
rundown of the portion of vid to look for,btohqsg
They gott be really desperate if they use that,btohqsg
More likely than not according to current polling  which is why Biden should step aside but I guess he doesn‚Äôt want to give up the presidency having spent more than half his life trying to work his way up,btohqsg
Polling is like never accurate ngl. Also not to mention Trump literally has jail time inching over his head,btohqsg
fr..thats the mentality you have after spending 50+ yrs as a politican,btohqsg
trump on the otherhand been a businessman,btohqsg
He can pardon himself if he gets in office yes. But some are state criminal indictments,btohqsg
Remember when Polling consistently showed Hillary over Trump for 2016,btohqsg
Yeah  I mean like even if Biden as a president is more productive than Trump the mere fact that he is seen as a Washington creature could deter some voters,btohqsg
Yeah true  but it‚Äôs cos of the electoral college. And also pollsters can constantly adjust their polling methods and weightage to account for past errors,btohqsg
The electoral college is really backward imo,btohqsg
It was almost gone and if it did history would‚Äôve been changed,btohqsg
Possibly no George w bush or trump,btohqsg
Like with a 2 round voting system  Al Gore and Hillary Clinton may have emerged as winners in the runoff,btohqsg
U mean Bush v Gore? Haha the Hanging chads,btohqsg
Yeah thanks to the conservative majority on the Supreme Court,btohqsg
Incredibly Al Gore conceded like a gentleman after the court decision,btohqsg
There probably would‚Äôve been no Iraq War if Al Gore was president,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt decipher some of the words lol,btohqsg
Anyway the scotus needs to implement term limits and presidents shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to nominate justices,btohqsg
Right now the best thing that could be done would be to stack the Supreme Court,btohqsg
Also remove citizens united. Just look at Clarence Thomas and all his lavish gifts lol  over here it would be considered bribery,btohqsg
In the US if you‚Äôre rich you can buy over people in government,btohqsg
I mean the whole reasoning for no term limits is so they won't have to beholden to anyone,btohqsg
How does that work though  I don‚Äôt get how having term limits makes one beholden to the person that nominated them,btohqsg
Well no not really it's just the one who nominates them will do so based on their past decisions,btohqsg
So someone like Amy Coney Barett used to be super Conservative in past decisions but now in the 6-3 court she's considered a swing vote sometimes for majority opinions lmao,btohqsg
But how does not having term limits do that,btohqsg
Just they can do whatever they want,btohqsg
We still have justices like Clarence Thomas,btohqsg
So whatever they want means beholden to no one so ig some form of independence there,btohqsg
But like I mean term limits can be like 10 years and after that they can never be reappointed again,btohqsg
He's always like that it ain't the first time,btohqsg
Just gotta wait for him to resign or die,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not that they can be reappointed for a 2nd term,btohqsg
Well if you do so then technically a senate can wait out the period,btohqsg
Yeah unfortunately. But it‚Äôs quite funny that George hw bush chose a liberal justice and an ultra conservative justice,btohqsg
It was a compromise most likely,btohqsg
Clarence Thomas‚Äô nomination was barely confirmed by the senate  it was 53-47 iirc,btohqsg
The other justice George hw bush nominated got over 90,btohqsg
If I don't agree with the certain justice  I can just remove em after 10 years,btohqsg
No I mean  one single term  and that‚Äôs it. Once they‚Äôve been appointed after 10 years they have to step down regardless of whether the incumbent president wants them to continue or not,btohqsg
Could also be more or less than 10 years  but 10 sounds reasonable to me,btohqsg
If u did so then a senate in power can just elect who they want for the entire court,btohqsg
Even if u staggered em usually Senate's have some form of swing and remain for about a decade,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt that what‚Äôs alr happening anyway? Just that the justices usually serve until they‚Äôre very old and retire or just die,btohqsg
And since its a decade it would not be very reflective of the current thinking too,btohqsg
Oh I mean if we start it now,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt have to be such that all at once,btohqsg
Could be one justice slot per year,btohqsg
Aiya honestly best is that the president or congress doesn‚Äôt get to pick scotus justices,btohqsg
I mean the people shouldn't pick a justice too,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt get why they have elections for state courts  but honestly  having elections for scotus justices might be better than the incumbent president nominating them,btohqsg
For state courts those are closed elections,btohqsg
Meaning the public doesn't vote for em it's like a group of legislatures or smth,btohqsg
But is that what you meant when you were referring to state court elections,btohqsg
?? I mean for some states its just direct nominated by the governor,btohqsg
Oh I thought it wasn‚Äôt voted by their state legislature  like the public gets to vote on the Attorney General,btohqsg
Idk a lot about this part,btohqsg
In some states yes but those are in the minority for direct voting,btohqsg
Then what do you mean by this tho? I just meant that the president shouldn‚Äôt be deciding on the nominations at least.,btohqsg
Also an Attorney General is still beholden to the courts with the judge as meditator,btohqsg
I just meant there isn't any alternative as well.,btohqsg
I have to research more about the US judicial system,btohqsg
Meanwhile trump who lost ‚Äúbigly‚Äù did the exact opposite and caused so much chaos,btohqsg
guys i just realise..the last hr ive been plucking at the side of my laptop not realising that it is..i just looked and realise im plucking off the plastic,btohqsg
all of yall need to play just shapes and beats,btohqsg
when someone sends u a msg rq on tiktokwill they get notified if u  accept their msg rq,btohqsg
yea like theres kurt tay and the 190cm basketballers at both ends,btohqsg
i saw the post and the 150cm woman is crazy bruhalso idk if its just me but alot of the girls i see who want very tall guys and think <180 is too short are those <155cm girls which is just laughable (some of them include ppl ik irl),btohqsg
Do u think his advice is good?,btohqsg

Dw doxx the girls/guys he match with,btohqsg
Me yeah I saw at least for tinder got 20+ a day,btohqsg

Unless he copy someone else that look like him,btohqsg
bro 20+ match a day is nth,btohqsg
I wouldn't know cos I dun use lol,btohqsg
But I got friends use can't even get match,btohqsg

But also got friends get like 50+ a day but with the paid version,btohqsg
I tot for avr guys no point cos won't get much matches.,btohqsg
how does tata even look like,btohqsg
maybe his double digit fwb is with men then its q easy to get cuz its probably all those old uncles,btohqsg
He got tall finance bro vibe n look,btohqsg
But he say he recommend I do surgery to boost by 5cm so I can be 6ft,btohqsg
And like surgery for my whole face cos I'm ugly,btohqsg
He said if I do surgery I can become edison chen etc,btohqsg
wait so is his whole personality how many girls he can get,btohqsg
ask him do sex work la,btohqsg
might as well make use of the looks to get money,btohqsg
if he cant even do sex work then dont say shit like this,btohqsg
just get paid for sex LOL,btohqsg
Oh yeah he say his idol is edison chen,btohqsg
Can leak tape and still be liked,btohqsg
ask him leak his own sex tape,btohqsg
if he really want do that,btohqsg
Then he say if I bring him an angmo xmm he will sponsor my surgery??? Wtffff then I fell asleep,btohqsg
Maybe shld make this into a sticker,btohqsg
if he want people to see his own sex tape,btohqsg
I think his advice for pipeline abit bs leh,btohqsg
Idk how he do pipeline 2 when he act like andrew tate,btohqsg
who is this who said this,btohqsg
pls dont listen to this and go touch some grass,btohqsg
do u really want to pull people who dress up as fictional characters,btohqsg
I mean he just randomly dm me and say all these stuff???,btohqsg
Then he asks for pics of my gf and say his fwb more chio etc...pissing me off,btohqsg
I Personally wouldn't .but have friends that wanna,btohqsg
I am attracted to fictional characters,btohqsg
Someone said that education isnt important anymore because celebrities managed to be successful despite dropping out of sch,btohqsg
Just becuz these cases exist doesn't mean it's like the norm,btohqsg
also idk why theso many rats going through the compettiive rat rae,btohqsg
is so funny of a sentence to me,btohqsg
Next up education isn't important cuz Bill Gates and Mark Kukubird all are dropouts,btohqsg
the example they used was rihanna,btohqsg
u r a rat yappa yapa yap,btohqsg
this specific student is an ASRJC drop out,btohqsg
out of the goodness of ur heart????,btohqsg
and also then i can justify giving shit quality work,btohqsg
literally everyone and their mom moonlights,btohqsg
have u seen sugaresque comment on work,btohqsg
my friend did $55/h tuition in a hot tent in wallaby,btohqsg
this is what people pay for when they go for tuition with sugaresque,btohqsg
‚Äúno this sentence is not good  but by the way did u know i had sugar in my coffee for breakfast and it was the sweetest thing in my life‚Äù,btohqsg
I tot tuition is more about marketing,btohqsg
Can ask em to go back ah SEAB ain't that stupid,btohqsg
‚Äúno  u need to spend more time studying. did i tell u all about how i spend 11 hours a day studying? realistic of course we dont want to burn out do we‚Äù,btohqsg
Looks like the same comments my TA gives for essays,btohqsg
if u have nothing to nitpick,btohqsg
literally every comment here is just,btohqsg
just ignore him la.anyone who spends that much time on sgexam discord is not someoen you should be listening to seriously,btohqsg
"like at least when i mark i directly re-write their work and not just say ""good""",btohqsg
cuz it was too on the spot,btohqsg
I keep thinking ldc is lious dreyfus,btohqsg
cuz now cambridge go put in their markers report,btohqsg
something along the lines of how stronger responses show differences in contexts across DCs or LDCs,btohqsg
so bo pian need write like that liao,btohqsg
ok wait i skimmed through this,btohqsg
whatever in green is written by me,btohqsg
GP also wanna talk abt DC Vs ldc,btohqsg
He sent u batshit stuff too?,btohqsg
whatever in black is the original essay,btohqsg
he sent me stuff about him self h*rming in dms,btohqsg
I heard now gp 8 qns,btohqsg
Should DM him asking to be his friend,btohqsg
@randkmdkddo you think arts stream students have advantage over sci stream for gp,btohqsg
I am a science stream student,btohqsg
Wait you took pcmg or smth right,btohqsg
Geog got alot of gp content,btohqsg
I feel that arts students tend to generally produce like okay-ish work ig cuz they alr write alotbut i feel that alot of arts students do alot of overnarration and underanalysis,btohqsg
like they love telling me shit thats happening in the world,btohqsg
but they dont check their own biases or assumptions when they write,btohqsg
Gp I tot just memorise ks bull and kaleidoscope,btohqsg
Idk I think I'm gonna fail gp,btohqsg
Problem is if U write GP essay like how U write geog U r fucked,btohqsg
actl ik how he looks like,btohqsg
Content geog does help tho icl,btohqsg
but idw dox ppl so yeah,btohqsg
What sort of sample paragraph is this,btohqsg
If u wan a picture dm me lol,btohqsg
"""Is conflict inevitable in today's volatile world""Cites Pedra Branca",btohqsg
I wrote that for like territorial claims,btohqsg
didnt know we still living in the 1980s,btohqsg
So the example too old la,btohqsg
and the writing also is kinda bad,btohqsg
we have International Organisations = confirm got peace because they are a neutral third party,btohqsg
If I memorise ks bull and got A means my compre alot better? Essay prolly shit,btohqsg
but what is so significant abt a neutral third party when it comes to international mediation?,btohqsg
this one i close one eye cuz if i do this is considered negative marking liao,btohqsg
theres also very little engagement with the condition in the first place - that the world is volatile,btohqsg
why cant we be like uk and just do  3 alvls,btohqsg
I generally dont think GP is a hard subject,btohqsg
Is just that students rely way too much on memory for GP,btohqsg
Geog also no neg marking hor,btohqsg
like cambridge has given 30/30 before for content,btohqsg
uhh normally all arts subjects dh?,btohqsg
u penalise for writing things that the marker expects to be there but its not,btohqsg
so for example i had a student who failed her content for GP last time,btohqsg
because she never talk about some examples,btohqsg
that the marker wanted her to talk about,btohqsg
even though the whole essay was sound,btohqsg
yeah thats an example of negative marking,btohqsg
But I feel overall it's need understanding of content also,btohqsg
Can't just vomit and wack and pray üíÄ,btohqsg
I always sleep in gp lectures,btohqsg
I only rmb got GP lecture post promos for tm,btohqsg
then the boy just uses phone or talks to his friend,btohqsg
The rest r all tutorial only,btohqsg
After like we get formal timetable,btohqsg
oh Friday gp tutorial I was playing wordle the whole time,btohqsg
GP lecture I only had twice,btohqsg
One is before formal timetable to go thru the exam format or smth,btohqsg
"""Hi guys we shall just not go for lecture and I will explain to the department why""",btohqsg
Then another was to go thru the new qn type,btohqsg
(but it's also kinda useless la tbh),btohqsg
The new item type or smth,btohqsg
idg all this qn type nonsense ngl,btohqsg
From passage 1 blah blah quoteFind smth from other passage that support or contradict the idea,btohqsg
Okay this one bopian need go through,btohqsg
i tot u talking about essay qn type,btohqsg
then yall MYE and Promos never test that meh,btohqsg
even YI taught CQ in J1,btohqsg
Like honestly TM GP dept is,btohqsg
It's either rly good Cher or rly shit,btohqsg
At least not teach like MID J2,btohqsg
EJ GP department takes the prize,btohqsg
Uhh its like the qn that asks u to find an idea from another passage and explain whether it undermines or supports,btohqsg
Honestly it felt damn chim at first,btohqsg
Just see if it's same same or diff idea only,btohqsg
U need filter the shit para I guess,btohqsg
that doesnt answer the qn in the first place,btohqsg
Qn: Examine the view that the arts must always be useful to societyReason: The arts must not always be useful to society but in most cases they are,btohqsg
Arts qns tend to be easy,btohqsg
cuz they always revolve around the same things,btohqsg
Actually have i even wrote an arts essay before,btohqsg
i think i did but on specific subsets,btohqsg
i wrote a fashion essay before,btohqsg
Cos cfm got a bunch of geopolitics qns that comes out,btohqsg
geopol never come about for past 2 years,btohqsg
Fossil fuels should no longer have a part in the production of energy.‚Äô Discuss,btohqsg
I mean idk i dont really classify by topics,btohqsg
cuz i just write whatever i wanna write,btohqsg
If I took it last yr,btohqsg
tbf last years paper was really easy,btohqsg
these were the qns i wrote as a jc student,btohqsg
when i tried to categorise them LOL,btohqsg
The only noticeable thing is i dont write science and tech,btohqsg
Geopolitics affects the crack spreads of gasoline/naphtha and volitatity of energy.also the implementation of cleaner energy via policy .but as its an absolute qn have to disagree,btohqsg
Coal plants still being built in china India etc,btohqsg
Coal cheaper than natgas LNG etc,btohqsg

to determine whether there are too many,btohqsg
I wrote the crime and punishment one and said the punishment is the lost of their right and freedom of movement,btohqsg
So it would be cruel and unusual to remove the others and would deny them their due process,btohqsg

Her colleagues are the one with anonymous,btohqsg

i help ppl with chinese on a discord server,btohqsg
but i dont charge money or claim that its tuition,btohqsg
Well then I guess all of them are shit,btohqsg
It‚Äôs sad that students can be hoodwinked into paying almost $400/month for such shit tuition,btohqsg
so might as well ask sch teachers,btohqsg
mine is $15 for 6 years,btohqsg
Tbh I mostly ask@chemcerfor chem help,btohqsg

"Yea but it's just a ""what if""",btohqsg
Isn't Tuition less bad than FA or property agent,btohqsg
Yeah but also some non IP schs have autonomous status,btohqsg
I don't regret going to DHS,btohqsg
I usually go to tuition centre,btohqsg
Lol I only charged 25/h for jc last time,btohqsg
My desk mate is from your school,btohqsg
shitty tutors can be worse than good FAs/property agents,btohqsg
That‚Äôs pretty decent if he accepts students from all sorts of schs,btohqsg
His students are mostly YI and JP,btohqsg
Actually I wanna give pri sch Chinese tuition but idk üíÄ,btohqsg
He has/had abt 130 students rn,btohqsg
So he does group tuition right?,btohqsg
Have seen tutors with diploma only charging 50-100 an hour for sec/pri school,btohqsg
Meh I mean group tuition is like that if overrun can‚Äôt charge extra,btohqsg
U can charge everyone extra no meh,btohqsg
Plus the tutor is also an ID/FA/property agent,btohqsg
Who even pays for this tho,btohqsg
Isnt pri sch tuition mostly 25/hr,btohqsg
Tbh autonomous is good aso  just more ex sch fees,btohqsg
Male tutor also with sweet wordz,btohqsg
But all may not agree to it  at least if it‚Äôs 1-1 they can tell the tutor when to stop. All the group tuitions I‚Äôve been to or heard of have a fixed lesson fee  only extra lessons then they can charge more,btohqsg
Haha jc I charge 25 cos most parents wanted female tutors,btohqsg
So bobian had to charge lower that time,btohqsg
