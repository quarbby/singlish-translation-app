110 is u are lucky   so many below 90 lol,btohqsg
Watch from 12:00 onward. See how he drives fast without worrying. And other drivers how they behave,btohqsg
Overtaking confidently at 270 with slower cars on slow lane. This you must not do in Malaysia. Super dangerous. I got into a 140 kmh accident along NS highway back in 2002. Sudenly a bus comes out from slow lane without ever signaling. Braked hard Alfa and still the bus bumper swiped my front fender.,btohqsg
What u mean why i can do 90,btohqsg
I dint raise it lah LOL. Everyone is moving faster than 80 also lea.,btohqsg
Everyone doing it doesn’t mean it’s legal … but I doubt it’s everyone because I see road hogs going 70 on lane 1,btohqsg
The Camara wont go off at 90   u never notice that ppl driving way faster then you pass the Camara ?,btohqsg
Not talking about the camera 😂,btohqsg
i see but LTA say before they allow +10 wor. If not as long we above 80kmh the camera will snap already ma,btohqsg
Are you those that see 80 and drive 80 at lane 1  and form a long q behind you ?,btohqsg
I dk how the camera works though ><,btohqsg
My ODO spoil thats why HAHA i think,btohqsg
I mentioned road hogs😏 so I doubt I am one,btohqsg
I agreed. I drove last weekend. Guess what  a Toyota was hogging on the 1st lane at 80km/h and even my beetle is catching up.Signal right and the toyota ignored. What a prick.,btohqsg
I think not everyone knows abt the signal right thing,btohqsg
"Then if lane 1 u drive at say 100  the other 2 lanes are also congested  yet the car behinds insist you to let it go ahead by tailing you?""",btohqsg
Tons of such I show u all what I saw 70 plus km at lane 1,btohqsg
If u are driving at 100 I confirm u can change to 2nd lane easily,btohqsg
This one upslope I can forgive la.,btohqsg
I drive 90 as well  near camera  drive 85.,btohqsg
Near 70km/h limit camera  I drive 75,btohqsg
So question  if I drive 90km/h on mce first lane  and there is another car that is driving faster than me from behind… am I considered hogging,btohqsg
As long u dun allow them to pass u are considered Hogging,btohqsg
lane 1 is for overtaking not for keeping to speed limit,btohqsg
I let them pass me when I’m nearer to the camera,btohqsg
The kind that give way only at camera zone,btohqsg
Say say only lah… always want to do that  but don’t dare to … later estimate wrongly  I kenna camera myself,btohqsg
Just let them pass. TP always around HAHA no camera also no issue =D,btohqsg
It’s not about letting them pass or not… some of them tailgate u like almost want to kiss ur boot when u are already driving like 100kmh,btohqsg
If the follow but not at tailgate will u make way?,btohqsg
Especially if u know they slowed down because u r there?,btohqsg
They just want to pass u. Just let them pass.,btohqsg
Let them pass la... If I travel at 80 on kpe or MCE...I am lane 3/4,btohqsg
Just give way lor. In msia  everyone very auto one lane one see faster cars coming auto give way one but in sg ppl see faster car coming always like to test brakes 🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
In msia...even lane 1 140 you see a perodua coming up  also just give way. Don't understand what's so hard to just move left. Very inconsiderate mentality here among the hoggers,btohqsg
and I really hate cars then cut into the lane when I am just keeping more safety distance in front. 😡My car still have disc brakes  most ecnobox classic cars have drums all around and they aren't as effective in stopping.,btohqsg
They dun care lah. U rear them u 99% lose liao HAHA,btohqsg
yea bo bian  that is the truth. when they cut in  I slow down lor,btohqsg
Keep 2 car not 1 car length i think good enough to anticipate such people cutting in especially no signal can still fight abit. Yupps,btohqsg
Then u will get overtaken by a lot more cars,btohqsg
Guys  end of day i guess it’s all down to giving way. I always give way no matter what  cuz i know the good karma will benefit me one day when i need it.,btohqsg
Tbh most are nice and will give way only a few,btohqsg
Safety is more impt. Really buay gian these cutting but what irritating is no signal come in like a boss. HAHAHA,btohqsg
I most buay gian when some cars just stick very close to the line  trying to cut  without signalling,btohqsg
Dunno is it their habit to drive near the edge  or are they planning to cut,btohqsg
Got once at PLUS a sg plate Merc e class was hogging lane 1 at 90  behind have 4 msia cars and 2 sg cars all stuck. Either act blur or cannot hear the horn. Eventually the perodua  ya it's somehow always them  cut him when there was a short gap,btohqsg
just give way lor doesnt kill tbh i always just give way nia,btohqsg
U mean eating lanes? Yah some dk what they doing eat lanes de lol,btohqsg
I know they want to cut lanes… but they don’t want to signal… so I won’t give way… until they lan lan have to show their signal,btohqsg
Dun get used to it bah. Will become a habit.,btohqsg
