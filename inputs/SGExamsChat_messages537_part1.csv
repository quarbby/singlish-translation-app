let total volume be x  volume removed be y,btohqsg
so after removed  left with (x-y)*0.9 milk  and (x-y)*0.1 water,btohqsg
then u add back y*0.3 milk and y*0.7 water,btohqsg
to get (x-y)*0.9+y*0.3 = 0.9x - 0.6y milk,btohqsg
final volume is still x  60% milk,btohqsg
so 0.9x - 0.6y = 0.6x,btohqsg

My honest two cents:If ppl canâ€™t afford  just use the school facilities.10 dollar is literally nothing  you cannot possibly expect hotel or conventional hall to rent to you at that price  unless you have 1 000 people paying and all willing to squeeze in.10 dollar can order some buffet style and hang a few balloons up  use the school equipment and decor good enough liao.Sec school prom right?
