The best part  u get 1.7 percent from uob absolute. So it is favourable exchange rate plus cashback,btohqsg
No money changer can beat that,btohqsg
Acceptance is high as the money goes in the merchant account next day  faster then card. I would imagine tng charge low fee or no fee compare to credit card,btohqsg
