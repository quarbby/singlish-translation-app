Current bids is those individual bidding right that why still $1,btohqsg
All the dealers submit bud only at 3 45. They still have 1hr to crunch their numbers and arrive at a decision to go in or not.,btohqsg
So the real number will only come at 345pm  only 15mins deadline can submit ?,btohqsg
Yes. U can submit since Monday IIRC,btohqsg
LTA wanted to announce only after bidding over. Sabo kias,btohqsg
They wanted to lock in the high COE,btohqsg
Someone at NCS prolly saw it then “oops”,btohqsg
All dealer shd have a system and plan all bid a dollar. Plunge the Coe down hosay,btohqsg

Wat last coe for cat a,btohqsg
Hahahaha.. no idea... This round is really weird. Usually around this time # of bids is lesser than quota. 😂,btohqsg
Seems like 120k for Cat B today,btohqsg
"Evidently gov doesn't have control on COE prices. 😂 Despite ""leaking"" phv news COE price for Cat A already breached last round",btohqsg
I strongly think COE will come down at some point before election. If you can wait can gamble with this strategy,btohqsg
