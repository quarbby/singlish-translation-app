Sell your current and buy another,btohqsg
I'm trying to ask questions. Can anyone answer me?,btohqsg
Can. But u have to seek lta approval first. They say can then can,btohqsg
But supersprint also only muffler. I just replace the stock muffler,btohqsg
Any bmw looking for cheap cheap mhd tune can pm me,btohqsg
Ya Toyota z4Toyota body  bmw engine,btohqsg
I can only hear my engine sound but not exhaust,btohqsg
Thats the works of the muffler to make some sound to it. If not  why spend money and not keep it stock,btohqsg
Like that  your engine shld be gone soon,btohqsg
The open pod making the sound lols,btohqsg
Thats not engine sound. Thats air intake sound,btohqsg
You change muffler your pick up slow asf,btohqsg
Then only full system does the job ah?,btohqsg
U just have to do a straight thru confirm loud. With supersprint exhaust💪,btohqsg
Was researching on exhaust system then just nice here also talking about exhaust.,btohqsg
Every year have to change back stock for inspection 😂,btohqsg
Be a man  just go inspection with straight thru💪,btohqsg
Lols I don't want waste my time leh😂,btohqsg
I go workshop ask them see how,btohqsg
All these do must got cert one. You anyhow put they also anyhow fine you 😂,btohqsg
That's why. I have the cert for my supersprint,btohqsg
Maybe tmr no need cert anymore,btohqsg
Tmr onward all aftermarket exhaust illegal 😂,btohqsg
I want the 10.30pm cut for alcohol removed  and can dine with more then 5,btohqsg
Full system will do its part if only you do proper tuning after installation else another way is go illegal,btohqsg
Go to bed the pillow stack higher😂,btohqsg
If exhaust rather buy new or 2nd hand??,btohqsg
I think see your pocket bro haha,btohqsg
Got alot of cs3 enthusiasts tell me get new because 2nd hand they put gen 2 legal but turn out inspection fail gen 1 not legal,btohqsg
Once sold you go inspection fail no refund one,btohqsg
No difference in performance  probably depends on how scratched they are. Some like to park all the way in then everyday scrap scrap scrap until the metal becomes so thin. Those better beware.,btohqsg
Then you got one exhaust put at home like stupid,btohqsg
Now got this current one just use,btohqsg
Tbh change muffler gt no performance gain. Only shift low end power to high end. Pickup will suffer a bit.,btohqsg
Dont just because want loud then the car when want power no power,btohqsg
Then no point la okok thanks,btohqsg
Its gonna be like this if you never tune your airflow all run input low output high,btohqsg
Lol ya do full package. Mod hardware then tune software.,btohqsg
Don't forget brakes 😂 later can go fast cannot stop in time also another prob,btohqsg
Later so loud and nice but step no go. Prius faster,btohqsg
It's for show 👍🏻 if not I modified car for what?,btohqsg
Please dont do it bro hahahah,btohqsg
Spend money on this kind no point one,btohqsg
Remember save some for paying lta,btohqsg
Civic 2.0 si not vtec ah?,btohqsg
