You get 4mpd if the Shopack/Favepay purchase falls under whitelisted merchants.,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163614Esavers promo 3.6% ends end Mar 24.,btohqsg
Ongoing promotion that renews at promotional interest rates (at that point in time) every 2-3 months,btohqsg
Usually dining food courts etc will get right,btohqsg
Yeah end by end march... After that is just 0.05% I assume,btohqsg
Just realised I made some purchases last yr by keying card details rather than Apple Pay  are such transactions eligible for 4mpd too?,btohqsg
SCB Esaver has a perpetual promo  just that you need more than one human to take advantage of it,btohqsg
Like what David said  usually have renewal but you might need to move the cash to another esavers account to fully make use of it (basically what Mt said).,btohqsg
Oohh ok thanks all for advice... Let me check out,btohqsg
Oh ya thanks I read wrongly.. it‚Äôs ‚Äúonline or offline transaction‚Äù thanks!,btohqsg
I trying to see if I can use uob one too.. need to hit min cc spending,btohqsg
But why OCBC 360 over UOB One account? The rewards on OCBC cards isn't that great also.,btohqsg
It has additional cashback for uob one cc,btohqsg
Talking about DFI. I stuck to choose uob evol or one cc lol. DFI groceries such as CS and jasons far to reach at my place. Should whitelist fair price also ley,btohqsg
Depends on whether she‚Äôs a miles or cashback person. Anyway  small issue,btohqsg
Webull new join rewards is so kuku. 25 chances of drawing share but all is USD 3 of tesla,btohqsg
Dont under what u mean by whitelist fairprice as they are in whitelist just no bonus rebate,btohqsg
ACB got whitelist one meh. I thought all MCCs. Unless I misunderstand ACB wrongly as Absolute Cashback,btohqsg
Because I don't hit min spent of $500 on cc on certain months... Uob one without cc spent don't have any interest...,btohqsg
I just cleared my uob one insurance mthly deduction. So move money out soon,btohqsg
Hmm no wonder the 0.6% don't matter to u. But you can pay other bills and insurances to clock bonus interests.,btohqsg
U mean u paying insurance to hit $500?,btohqsg
U mean for uob one CC spent? How about salary credit since is going to my OCBC 360,btohqsg
ya me took up & move on after Mar,btohqsg
Just transfer 1.6k to UOB One? And then transfer back the next day.,btohqsg
Through paynow n indicate salary right? Does it still work now?,btohqsg
Paynow from ocbc web or fast transfer from dbs and select salary payment,btohqsg
My bad i didnt read everything properly ayah my boss nowadays go overseas and he doesnt trust anyone with the company money so we pay first then claim from company.I think starting from now i dont do it so much and try again in the next few month,btohqsg
Any suggestion for competitive bid for the latest 6 mths T bill? Thanks,btohqsg
Bid slightly higher than your true next best alternative investment of similar profile.,btohqsg
hi  Syfe cash guaranteed rate for 3 mth is 3.8%. Any other platform has higher than this?,btohqsg
why not just stick to SCB Esaver 3.6% p.a. for general public..https://www.sc.com/sg/save/savings-accounts/esaver/,btohqsg
most certainly will be replaced by another apr to may (with march ADB comparison) promo.,btohqsg
It is very very important not to confuse/compare SYFE account with a full bank savings account.,btohqsg
Anyone registered UOB rising dragon in January? Are your deposits earmark and cash credited already?,btohqsg
OK. Thanks. I was thinking if earmark early end early.,btohqsg
Haha yours is the Christmas one.ZQsee here:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163442,btohqsg
oops sorry my bad for pasting the wrong one,btohqsg
Is the Styfe capital guaranteed as well? This is different from interest rate. That is the advantage of saving account.,btohqsg
This is basically similar to FD. In fact one of the highest rn.,btohqsg
Park it in a money market fund. Some are doing as high as 3.6/3.9%,btohqsg
Cash+ Guaranteed is a managed investment portfolio  and should not be taken as a deposit. Until the investment is locked in  the rate is subject to change. Investment capital and returns are guaranteed subject to underlying bank risk. This has more risk as compared with bank FD. As long you aware of it,btohqsg
i think they do something like topup the difference such that even if you lose on the fund price  overall you will get back 100% + 3.8% p.a. right?but u are still subject to the credit risk of SYFE and i think there is slippage with the transfer in and out of funds from SYFE (do they use FAST  and is the fund accruing 3.8% instantly?(,btohqsg
If you are using poems to trade  they will auto put your idle cash in MMF for you for 3.5%.,btohqsg
I just parked the access from my uob 100K into their mmf ... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
You can also put into United SG fund. But they paid dividends  monthly whereas poems paid on daily basis.,btohqsg
I think is just similar to FD  but until they lock in your investments  the rates may change last min. And not SDIC insured.,btohqsg
I just got lazy since that's my salary account. I just park some in there every month when I pay my bills üòÅ,btohqsg
Currently at 3.77 I guess it's ok,btohqsg
i won't trust these published rates at all,btohqsg
