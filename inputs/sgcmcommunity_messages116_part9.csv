"""By mixing higher with lower RON octane  the sulphur and all the additive substances of the higher octane fuel will be lost in the mix. This can lead to severe problems in the engine  as the RON decreases  engine performance is diminishing. To maintain the same performance the engine will need more fuel""",btohqsg
