Dont think they notify individually  but I happened to see on their website-https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/cards/365-cashback-credit-card,btohqsg
Now just worried that the additional cashback isn't coming in  cos only the card cashback is in so far üòï,btohqsg
Silly question. Does IRAS allow monthly payment of taxes manually (ie via AXS) or is monthly option only available via GIROThinking of using Amex + GrabPay MC,btohqsg
split to GIRO monthly installment  pay using other means before 28th in previous month for payment to be processed in time to avoid giro deduction,btohqsg
Hi experts  for those self-employed personnel income is submitted yearly to IRAS  does it affect us when applying for flat in the future for those that submit less income,btohqsg
1. amaze no points for local2. Please read CIMB World mc on what are the eligible categories,btohqsg
For SEP  need to take 30% haircut OFF* annual income for assessment (guideline  not fixed rule). So don't underdeclare as it is also a chargeable offence,btohqsg
There is Liquidpay *via* Credit Card  Liquid Cash  Liquid Account.Only Liquid account can pay through Paynow QR. which also means no hack.,btohqsg
