Really hard to work with unless youre fine with 2nd hand,btohqsg
if JC rite  you're better off buying an iPad,btohqsg
Wouldnt a laptop be btr for pw tho,btohqsg
I think an iPad is more functional than a $500 laptop,btohqsg
even then  $500 is super tight,btohqsg
True but i find it easier to type on a laptop than an ipad,btohqsg
From what ive seen from my friend,btohqsg
A $500 laptop won't last u very long ether,btohqsg
In most jcs i think you can borrow laptops,btohqsg
if u don't need to use a lot of applications,btohqsg
and just need it for like documents and stuff,btohqsg
u can look at a chromebook,btohqsg
i can print stuff from chromebook right like i connect to printer?,btohqsg
my sister use ipad for her university pw she say its much easier than laptop,btohqsg
i like the science behind it ig,btohqsg
i took bio in sec sch and respiration was interesting to me so i felt id like sports sci?,btohqsg
i wld consider outdoor adv learning (is that a course lol?) but im not very fit,btohqsg
i dropped in s3 alr lol,btohqsg
or did you mistake me for someone else,btohqsg
Hmm or you said itâ€™s your best subject,btohqsg
A1 ðŸ¥º im still in denial but its ok,btohqsg
Ppl who didnt do 3/4 of the paper also passed so the amath bellcurve was rly gd,btohqsg

whats the diff between raw score and net score,btohqsg
nett takes into acc bonus points which can be attained from more than one and max 2 of these: cca performance (if good  -1  excellent -2)  higher mt D7 and up (-2)  third lang pass(?) (-2) (pls correct me if im wrong @ everyone else),btohqsg
to be eligible for jc u nd 20 pts RAW before deduction of points,btohqsg
but once ur eligible for jc they dont care abt ur raw score  they only look at ur nett,btohqsg
One is with cap the other isnt,btohqsg
Speaking of laptops  are laptops or iPads compulsory to have/bring in most JCs?,btohqsg
but would be convenient for PW,btohqsg
Some subjects are laptop subjects  where itâ€™s a lot more convenient to make notes with laptop,btohqsg
But not exactly compulsory of course,btohqsg
most jcs would loan out laptops for you to use for PW,btohqsg
if you dont mind bringing your own laptop to sch  it is more convenient to use your own laptop for pw,btohqsg
yes  its now pretty much compulsory,btohqsg
but dont have to bring to jc unless its for pw,btohqsg
Does anyone know anyone from privAte dip going to loCal Uni?,btohqsg
so is a laptop really compulsory? or just a computer is fine? for JC,btohqsg
its a genuine question  I really don't know need or not mao,btohqsg
I think it's not compulsory but it's very good to have one,btohqsg
if you ever need to use a computer in school  can borrow from them,btohqsg
