Not monitoring much market like quite dull,btohqsg
Some counters the queue very deep  touch the price doesn‚Äôt mean your order fulfilled,btohqsg
I was doubting his buy at 0.38 earlier in the day because it only touched that number a bit,btohqsg

He bought earlier. He just say in chat late. He got say in other chats earlier. But I cannot verify when he actually bought lah. Haha just saying that time stamp not accurate,btohqsg
If really so then it‚Äôs just unfortunate coincidence cuz a few secs earlier got .38 transaction,btohqsg

Nothing wrong with swing trading  just that some here might not want to swing trade  so they gotta know,btohqsg
