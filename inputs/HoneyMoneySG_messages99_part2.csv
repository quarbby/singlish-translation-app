why not consider MMF at 3.6~% right now,btohqsg
It is likely banks will revise their interest rates this year. But you should still take advantage of the promotional interest,btohqsg
Hi  is this 3.57% cashback on HSBC Revolution extended beyond 31 March 2024? It currently reflects that the the conversion rate of $10 for 2800 Reward Points on the HSBC app.,btohqsg
ah iâ€™ll look into it  thanks!,btohqsg
I will contribute one more#dp!CSO reply:As per checking further in the record  from 2nd May 2024  GIRO for financial institutes that deals with Trades  Stock Exchanges and Crypto. Some examples are: iFAST  moomoo and Interactive brokers is no longer eligible for the cashback.Credit Card bill payment to other banks credit card will still be eligible to earn the cashback.,btohqsg
"but MMF is considered an investment ah   so there will be ""risk"" even though its very very low",btohqsg
Now specific institution names also have ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
yep! may i ask what mmf you invest in?,btohqsg
most people are using moomoo fulerton SGD cash fundi am not using MMF because i am using UOB one currently @3.85%Once the UOB nerfs comes in then i will consider changing to MMF or OCBC,btohqsg
Yes  redeemed yesterday 1/4 at this rate too. Though specified nowhere,btohqsg
GurusIf I want to trade sgp  Hk and USA  stocks predominantly. Currently using std chart as platformIs ibkr the best platform to go for?,btohqsg
Do note the difference between saving account and MMF in terms of liquidity  capital guaranteed. You should have at least one saving account with fund for emergency purpose,btohqsg
Heard SC bonus$aver interest rate got nerfed  Is OCBC 360 our last fort left?,btohqsg
i believe that MMF could be considered emergency funds as well   cause it takes 3-5 days to withdraw which is quite decently liquid. As for emergency purpose   i think it differs from one person to the other   in my case there won't be any emergency funds needed. which i do keep 5-10k aside,btohqsg
this one is low chance  but in the event of a financial crisis.. a money market fund has the right to halt redemptions.,btohqsg
ohhhh because the MMF not enough cash ?,btohqsg
yeah MMF doesn't hold your cash as cash in the bankMMF will use your cash to go invest in short term bonds  fixed deposits  fiduiciary deposits.. etc..so example if 50% of the investors want their cash back.. impossible for them to return in 1-2 days time,btohqsg
AND MMF has no SDIC insuranceto be fair.. i would say both bank accounts and MMF are definitely low risk..but cannot assume both are equal.. they are still different,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing  my meaning is that you must have sufficient funds as stated. One cannot use the redeeming funds to buy new ones in the same month,btohqsg
With the drop in UOB and Standard Chartered interests.. where is a good place to park 200k idle funds? Is there any changes to UOB stash account which sits at 5% for 100k savings..,btohqsg
UOB One Bonus interest in! (second final 5% month)Magical figure = SGD420.62,btohqsg
Yup  your application canâ€™t even go through if u have insufficient funds. I was addressing OP on whether SSB will reject the application (due to max cap) despite the same month redemption.,btohqsg
Another cso sayWe advise the GIRO payment to pay other bank credit card bill is excluded transactions.,btohqsg
we should STOP ASKINGjust observe from May 2024 what happens...,btohqsg
Serious? I thought it was 5% when you put in a 100k but you can't perform any withdrawal.,btohqsg
It's always been 3%  you rather have 150k in UOB One for 4% in May.,btohqsg
See the EIR and not what they promote,btohqsg
Im sorry I can't send photo here.. but I've read it carefully that it is 0.05 base interest + up to 4.95% when MAB remains the same or increase.,btohqsg
Yes I got that figure too.. it doesn't add up to 7.8 as well.. weird.,btohqsg
Lol thereâ€™s different rates for tier. Just see the EIR instead,btohqsg
Yes I did. The 5% only eligible for 100k deposit,btohqsg
5% is only for the last 30k,btohqsg
Oh so that's how they add up? Hah... Okay guess I'm done with UOB,btohqsg
You did not see the tiers properly then..,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s what the tiers are for lol,btohqsg
I started the account in the UOB branch and I was told by the staffs la...,btohqsg
That's why I took out from Moomoo cash plus and put in UOB.. maybe it's time to find a better one..,btohqsg
uob v good giving false impression.. hahah..,btohqsg
You guys going for T-bills and SSB ?,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not false impression. Itâ€™s true that it gives 5% or 7.8% but on different tiers. All banks does this,btohqsg
if you go for v v v secured way to park money,btohqsg
just give us the final % as a way to count the final return.. i see it as marketing gimmick imho,btohqsg
Itâ€™s in their website known as EIR  isnâ€™t that a clear enough indication? They didnâ€™t state itâ€™s 7.8 for the whole 100k,btohqsg
Yea I want to be secure.. I already have about 100k in high risks investments and I prefer security for what I have now..,btohqsg
Maribank 2.5% after 30 June if no extension. GXS Pocket 2.68% will be higher then.,btohqsg
UOB One is 5% p.a. on $100k now.UOB One will be 4% p.a. on $150k in future.,btohqsg
Then you can go for either mmf or syfe cash+,btohqsg
my biggest regret was not to buy SOLANA coins when it was like $10..,btohqsg
Thank you.. maybe I'll just try the 150k one first..,btohqsg
Possible they will extend since itâ€™s still one of the lowest at 100k balance,btohqsg
