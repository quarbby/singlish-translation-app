don‚Äôt need take ucat in the same year as a level right,btohqsg
HelloPlease i wish to travel to another country in order to enroll into collegeAny idea on how?,btohqsg
Bro needs an hour to travel and our shift is at 930,btohqsg
He shld be on time  he says he gonna taxi,btohqsg
Maybe he is in the practical exam,btohqsg
Maybe he can use physics to make the car go faster lmao,btohqsg
Is this national or school exam,btohqsg
suspect now is national exams period,btohqsg
Damn imagine not knowing your own national exam time,btohqsg
I was told that I almost burnt down the chemistry lab during O level prac :D,btohqsg
Hey at least you were not the clown that randomly did a pop sound,btohqsg
Or the kid that burnt the wooden pliers using the Bunsen burner,btohqsg
Oh.. and also not the kid that connected wires to the battery body itself then wonder why the volt meter is not showing anything,btohqsg
wtf  are all these experiments things that you know or witnessed personally,btohqsg
Then when the teacher told said kid to connect to the ends‚Ä¶bro was like ‚Äúthe clips keep falling out‚Äù,btohqsg
Bro was clipping using the tip of the clips,btohqsg
bro probably doesn't pay attention in practical lessons,btohqsg
Bro has nvr touched one lmao,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like clipping coins using pliers but instead of clipping it sideways,btohqsg
I rmb got one fren during normal class he clip the ammeter from the top,btohqsg
idk how to feel about experiments going wrong in exams,btohqsg
The one that burned the wooden pliers yea have not seen fire on wood,btohqsg
did your friend realize it later,btohqsg
The whole time all I see was his pliers above the flame  the glass tube he was holding was not even near the flame,btohqsg
Someone needs to get their eyes check,btohqsg
Oh please don‚Äôt get me started,btohqsg
Some kid decided ‚Äúgently‚Äù meant turning on the Bunsen burner slightly,btohqsg
He put the test tube and waited for a long ass time to only realise  his flame did not even exceed the metal protrusions of the Bunsen burner,btohqsg
TLDR: imagine the flame you see from a lighter Coming from the Bunsen burner and kid thought the flames could reach hisüß™ .,btohqsg
my eyes aren't as bad as this,btohqsg
i think i failed all my experiments as well,btohqsg
