Ya Citi not the old Citi used to be before I feeling,btohqsg
Maybe is due to the singsaver promo.. a lot of backlog to clear,btohqsg
How slow u meant? Within a week is ok right? Cimb card came to me in 4 working days,btohqsg
i expect like 1-2 days la. like i applied dbs ww/ ocbc tr  because i am their existing customer le so by right should be quite fast ma.DBSWW and OCBCTR is like almost immediately  max 1 day if i can recall,btohqsg
Hmm if 2 days so far I experienced amex .,btohqsg

Soo Citi put on low priority over uob ? Hahaha,btohqsg
I think citi Singapore not sold. All Sea apart Singapore.,btohqsg
Maybe just changed of management lor,btohqsg
Which card to use for government hospital bill?,btohqsg
I think the usual will be top up grab and pay,btohqsg
Amex is accepted in gov hospital,btohqsg
Then this is a better and more straight forward,btohqsg
if not use TCB -> Grab,btohqsg
Don't think worth to use grab ni point now a day's so just directly use amex will do,btohqsg
No Need go the extras step,btohqsg
This is positive. Unless they have a better point system,btohqsg
For the citi rewards cc bonus 9x points  do I have to wait for the month to end inorder to get the points?,btohqsg
Few days it will appear in the app very nice,btohqsg
I used Citi Cashback+ at Mount Elizabeth Hospital and so far got the cashback. See doctor and went for scoping,btohqsg
Not sure about government hospital though but should be the same?,btohqsg
Now that grab card has greatly diminished their rewards even for grab wallet  what are you guys paying your dailies with?,btohqsg
I am still using grab + Amex.Still can 1.7%,btohqsg
if let say my cpf have enough to pay for a 2room hdb one shot  do i still need to get the hdb loan to deduct monthly with interest?,btohqsg
No need  but not the best use of money unless you want peace of mind,btohqsg

"Hi all  i just watched the video ""The BEST Ways to Invest in S&P 500 with Cash/CPF/SRS in 2022"" I'm relatively new to investing and got a few qns i wish to ask..- Chris mentioned that VOO has a 0.03% of expense ratio and SPY has 0.09% expense ratio. May i ask when do i pay this expense ratio? If i were to buy it from say the trading app MooMoo?- - is this expense ratio  on top of all the MooMoo platform fees and trading fees?- I noticed that currently VOO is $339.320 but SPY is $369.320 and the Index is 3707.15. May i know why is there such a huge contrast difference between VOO and SPY? Eventhough in the video Chris said that it monitors the SnP500 index closely.",btohqsg
via healthhub mcc 8099  not govt,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if after a payment has been made to your Citi rewards MasterCard  does it reflect on the Citi mobile app or the statements?,btohqsg
When I made the payment on Monday  it was reflected as still processing. But today when I checked  the payment isn‚Äôt there anymore and my balance is still the same,btohqsg
very weird  just now i called dbs  the person told me 8099 not eligible for dbs ww 10x points,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not inside the ‚Äúview all transactions‚Äù,btohqsg
why not? anyway this is trialed and tested,btohqsg
that is why i am confuse and i called in to ask.,btohqsg
because at first she dont want to entertain me because i havent charge to the card yet.but i told her i already have the mcc code. she insist i need to charge  then end up maybe she just want to brush me off.,btohqsg
is it an actual charge or holding charge? when u say balance still the same means you not actually charged for the transaction? what kind of transaction?,btohqsg
think u can just refer to the Terms and conditions yourself  quite clearly not excluded,btohqsg
She say that 8099 is under professional services and in the T&C professional service is excluded wor ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑,btohqsg
It was a holding charge on Monday. But then it disappeared and did not become an actual charge. The money was already deducted from my DBS but not reflected as an actual charge,btohqsg
transaction on citibank card right? how does dbs gets into the picture?,btohqsg
