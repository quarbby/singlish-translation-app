Do you think SBF in feb 25 will include Tg Rhu? (I missed the submission when I was in overseas in feb)Is SBF slughtly more expensive then BTO price?,btohqsg
Yes sbf will be more expensive than the BTO when it LaunchIf 2017 BTO still got balance flat how can compared to current pricing,btohqsg
Tg Thu bto won’t be in Feb 25 sbfAs it’s still the selection period,btohqsg
Ah ya  my mistakes  feb is for another project  didnt submit for Tg Rhu was becos my partner prefer HV  but I personally like Tg Rhu  n don't mind HV.,btohqsg
Ok. Reason I ask is becos I might not get HV since is outside supply  so thought I could then submit SBF for Tg Rhu.Ok never mind  1 step at a time. Thanks all for all the info.,btohqsg
Haven’t started selection yetUsually selection last more than 6 monthsYou can wait for 2026 SBF but no guarantee have any leftover unit also,btohqsg
How much out of supply are u? Holland V might have high dropout as the price more expensive than THC,btohqsg
How about ethnic quota? If ethnic quota full no need to go down,btohqsg
We wish to clarify that the waiver of the non-selection count is based on the units left available when your turn is due  not based on ethnic quota.Not sure why,btohqsg

Got this message when ethnic quota is full so can skip thurs appointment,btohqsg

So might be helpful to check ethnic quota,btohqsg
