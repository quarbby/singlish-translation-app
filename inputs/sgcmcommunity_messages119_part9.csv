Now they willing to absorb GsT for you so better get while it’s still there,btohqsg
Space wise better than XC40 Recharge,btohqsg
Eh so other EV cannot use the supercharger ah,btohqsg
Not for now. But in the US  they opening up 7500 of them for other EV users alr.,btohqsg
But if you see the grand scheme of things right,btohqsg
What they want is to “convert” other EV users to a Tesla. “Free marketing”,btohqsg
Becoz they won’t be charging at the 250KW speed where the Teslas will be. Capped at whatever the car is designed for  like 150kW or 120kW,btohqsg
Most EV competitors cap their charging rate for 150kW. Even the Ioniq 5 for example. Fastest is 120kW,btohqsg
About 30-45 mins for a 0-80%.,btohqsg
Decent but not as fast as 15 mins for sure.,btohqsg
In the US Tesla are getting sued if they dont open up superchargers to other makes. So maybe will open up eventually in SG,btohqsg
Heard from ioniq 5 dealer the pricing will be out soon. Revised after recent ARF valentines Day gift 😆,btohqsg
Funny that in korea ioniq is like their everyday car,btohqsg
To us it’s a luxury car,btohqsg
Yeah apparently ioniq is a regular rental car for them,btohqsg
our reality is gov wants only the richest to drive,btohqsg
They'd rather you pay for public transport,btohqsg
Also it's them recovering lost revenue from low income taxes,btohqsg
Other countries have lower cost of cars,btohqsg
But their income tax can be 50%,btohqsg
So it can balance out in an ideal world,btohqsg
If you buying petrol in local petrol kiosks  you need to produce IC for recording purposes by the pump attendant. Singapore is pretty tough and harsh on this aspect.,btohqsg

Looking at a used stonic from used car.. anyone have experience n feel of stonic ?,btohqsg
Advice please .. :) txs in advance,btohqsg
From a friend:Enough d2d torque but not the most exciting.,btohqsg
Ya the torque is sufficient for day to day driving use,btohqsg
But of coz not the most exciting,btohqsg
Quite decent  that powertrain has been used in many kia-hyundai cars,btohqsg
1 litre turbo. Can go genting?,btohqsg
Otherwise the car is pretty basic not much to worry about apart from basic maintenance,btohqsg
But you will definitely stick to the slow lane and feel the power loss as you climb,btohqsg
Thanks thanks.. even bread n butter car cost so much,btohqsg
For better performance drive in manual  keep it in the powerband,btohqsg
But for wear and tear you better PPI first,btohqsg
Any better car in stonic range? 12k dep per yr,btohqsg
Why the plate is yellow or is that orange?,btohqsg
Registration to business can get the car cheaper?,btohqsg
Like Civic all these should be around there,btohqsg
If not the new Cerato actually using the  new Avante engine and CVT.,btohqsg
But more ex. I don’t know why,btohqsg
White and yellow plate actually no difference,btohqsg
White/yellow plate is just a choice. No diff from black,btohqsg
That's way out the range of his 12k depre sir,btohqsg
Kia cerato is a good bet,btohqsg
Yeah the older gen within his 12k mark,btohqsg
