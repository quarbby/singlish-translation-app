apart of deposit  min credit card spend and credit of salary,btohqsg
but I dont know how to calculate the bonus int  so wanna to learn from the experts here.,btohqsg
100k times 0.05 divide by 12 months ≈ 420/mth,btohqsg
thanks  I'm guessing 5%. I just found my answer from the website.  5% is EIR..,btohqsg
100k deposit (u can do with less but max EIR is achieved with 100k) + spend $500 on UOB One CC + credit min $1600 of salary each month by employer (must appear on statement as SALA or SALA PAYNOW),btohqsg
Just use their official calculator here for quick referencehttps://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.page,btohqsg
thanks so much  I was silly  never check.,btohqsg
I'm just keeping a max of 100K .. didnt see anything more if you exceed 100K savings..,btohqsg
Ya their calculator will generate the exact u get  even if u put like $110k for example,btohqsg
Though keep in mind that their calculator will show u $5203 as the interest earned (they sneakily added in the total of $200/year from the card rebates you’ll get from spending $500 a month),btohqsg
it works  anything more than 100K  the EIR is not attractive..,btohqsg
Correct. Just put the rest somewhere els E,btohqsg

Hi  May I know which card is good to book SIA tkt to HK. Approx $600,btohqsg
Depends on how many criteria u can meet. If u can meet all criteria for ocbc360  then it is better than uob one,btohqsg
then I think ocbc.360 suit you better  uob1 needs cc spend. but ocbc 360 may not need so,btohqsg
