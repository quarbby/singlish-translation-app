I feel.inferior to these perfect lookin ppl,btohqsg
In true National Day Spirit  Dekita needs to listen to the Theme Song of National Day Parade 2013! 🎊,btohqsg
People cringe when they see someone mention that song but be clueless when a later year is mentioned,btohqsg
Really says a lot about how memorable that song waseven though it's not the desired memorable,btohqsg
im in paradise its a wonderful place for me,btohqsg
Yeah libraries are open for you to take books  but not open for studying yet,btohqsg
Please seek approval before posting any advertisement,btohqsg
in the meantiime donki donki is getting free airtime,btohqsg
The donki at jcube has the kny collab merch,btohqsg
So yeah I will keep my mouth shut,btohqsg
I regret my secondary school weeb phase has led me to understood this,btohqsg
I realised that there is no chemistry  physics and social studies questions asked recently.,btohqsg
Why random ppl keep adding me on line,btohqsg
Im a genie in a bottle,btohqsg
Saying a line in romaji doesnt make you a weeb,btohqsg
No need to be in denial 😎😎😎,btohqsg
No need to be in denial 😎😎😎,btohqsg
I didnt say im not a weeb tho,btohqsg
No need to be in de neil,btohqsg
It doesn’t even sound the same,btohqsg
Reply to a user or mention them,btohqsg
Unbuff ppl not allowed in this grp,btohqsg
Id prefer cck coz easier to do after camp hahaha,btohqsg
Siao why would i come MI,btohqsg
Who say my gf live cck,btohqsg
doesnt have to live in cck,btohqsg
as long as its gf house,btohqsg
Idw go mi id rather study home,btohqsg
or ur just the kind whos too lazy,btohqsg
just ask permission to serve extra,btohqsg
or maybe i didnt phrase it right,btohqsg
my name not obvious enough isit,btohqsg
No coz i saved ur contact,btohqsg
It shows ur name for me,btohqsg
But it showed paris for a second hahah,btohqsg
u do thr hormat hormat all in malay also,btohqsg
No ? I give commands in english,btohqsg
i thought marching all commands are in bahasa,btohqsg
neil stop lying to me :<,btohqsg
Then u wouldn't be giving marching commands,btohqsg
Go study. Boys are temporary but a levels is forever,btohqsg
i have no male in my life,btohqsg
WHY ARE U ATTACKING ME NOW,btohqsg
Just work hard and it will be fine,btohqsg
Not what i know tsk tsk,btohqsg
Interviewer: What was your A level score 30 years ago,btohqsg
if u knew anyth theres nth to know,btohqsg
Go study  your mom called me to tell you to go home to study,btohqsg
my mum’s with me u bimbo,btohqsg
i still need to break it up,btohqsg
Break it up not break up,btohqsg
AGAIN I ASK WHY AM I BEING ATTACKED,btohqsg
Love is temporary  the glory of econs is forever,btohqsg
stfu u have no rights u have no say,btohqsg
watch me turn into an old single woman,btohqsg
18 year old zoomers be like : ive seen the war,btohqsg
If you keep saying that ill stop subscribing to your onlyfans,btohqsg
can i have a close up pic,btohqsg
SINCE WHEN WERE AIR FORCES CANVAS,btohqsg
Airforce ones were always canvas shoes,btohqsg
i thought its more of a pvc ish material,btohqsg
Oh not that kind of canvas,btohqsg
Airforce ones are all customisable as long as white hahaha,btohqsg
That looks like IB in the alevel grp,btohqsg
I think its an apt ques for@ferrelcell,btohqsg
Haha what the heck  star track.,btohqsg
It says follows whatever the fuck kind of spastic username u have,btohqsg
Today the weirdest unexplainable shit happened. This morning i rmmbr i put my letter in my drawer. Jn i woke up and its gone. Im so confused,btohqsg
"Somehow I read this as ""I put my sister in my drawer""",btohqsg
The top drawer or the bottom,btohqsg
Theres a ghost in my house stealing my shit,btohqsg
My sister is not a baby,btohqsg
And how do you know i had a sister you creep,btohqsg
I said I read it as that,btohqsg
Jung hon only thought u had a sister,btohqsg
Since u didn't say whether that's false...,btohqsg
I hate you guys with a passion,btohqsg
Im gonna calm down for while,btohqsg
Theres no way smtg can disappear in the house,btohqsg
U cant when daddys choking u,btohqsg
Thanks guys for helping love yall 😘,btohqsg
why is this chat getting degen,btohqsg
HAHAHA i don't know how make this chat less degen 😞😞😞,btohqsg
I thought youre the degen slayer,btohqsg
The only one that can make this chat not degen,btohqsg
In order to defeat a monster first you have to become a monster,btohqsg
I read yall as my name,btohqsg
Is reddit down or is it just me,btohqsg
Must be all the chromosomes im collecting,btohqsg
If only u could collect offs that way,btohqsg
Guys  what are the pros and cons of yale nus? Thinking of applying since admissions just opened,btohqsg
Heard that their science mods aren't that good yet,btohqsg
Also they really like flipped classrooms,btohqsg
Yale nus is famous for liberal arts anyway,btohqsg
when are your prelims for a levels students,btohqsg
Anyone know how to program pic18 f4550 here :'),btohqsg
Save me plz  my groupmates are useless,btohqsg
what do u need to do,btohqsg
I have to fucking reprogram the entire thing by TMR 1pm :'),btohqsg
what do u need the array for,btohqsg
Making a food dispenser that has user and admin settings,btohqsg
Yeah but the array contents need to be able to edit by the cell,btohqsg
Or at least by the row or column,btohqsg
I have no idea how to do that,btohqsg
If I get saved I'm buying bubble tea for whoever helped the most 👉🏻👈🏻,btohqsg
Sian no one can save me ah,btohqsg
I'm broke and I don't live with my parents  can u like have mercy,btohqsg
Not many people know C++ here and the ones who do probably won't help >_>,btohqsg
you asking how to initialise or how to edit and modify,btohqsg
Shouldnt u make it a varchar then,btohqsg
B o t h would be great but mostly edit and modify,btohqsg
Might be useful if you give example c0de,btohqsg
Arent u proficient in cpp too,btohqsg
I am nowhere near 'proficient' lmao,btohqsg
I still have to complete all the extra function in function :'),btohqsg
your 2d array you label the columns starting from 0 left to right,btohqsg
rows top down starting from 0,btohqsg
arr[0][0] is then the top left most cell,btohqsg
arr[0][1] is the cell on its right,btohqsg
I google this I get a microcontroller of some  kind?,btohqsg
I'm mostly concerned if I can put multiple characters inside each little cell,btohqsg
Or will I need multiple arrays,btohqsg
Multi chars as in a string?,btohqsg
each cell is a unsigned char,btohqsg
Unless you init your array to hold that many subarrays then no,btohqsg
Okok let me draw out what I'm trying to achieve,btohqsg
This is more C than C++,btohqsg
yes you can create a 2d array of chars to make it hold an array of strings,btohqsg
yeah lol if cpp i'd be using vectors and strings,btohqsg
How does the program know the memory size den,btohqsg
you have to make the row size the length of the largest string,btohqsg
and you use null terminators per row,btohqsg
Why array  vector.push_back is what E V E R Y O N E suggests,btohqsg
Avtually i might have what u need or smth similar,btohqsg
If whay ure asking is smth like a tile,btohqsg
Where in a tile map u can asdign numbers,btohqsg
And the numbers mean diff things,btohqsg
Dunno  need question asker to really clarify end-goal,btohqsg
Also microcontroller big sad  niche area,btohqsg
It's an even more niche area than general programming btw.,btohqsg
It's very close to the silicon,btohqsg
So I need to be able to add new rows,btohqsg
Cant u just use a rdbms for this,btohqsg
@Alexandra_WildeCan you use vectors? Dun think arrays will work >_>,btohqsg
i can only recommend that you use a struct,btohqsg
Nope  c++ only cuz that ain't in my sllybus,btohqsg
You help ba  my C++ boundary hit,btohqsg
if you're truly using cpp  then use vectors,btohqsg
I noob at C++ but from what I think struct is custom type,btohqsg
I might not have time to learn new shit,btohqsg
Is there a way I can do something similar,btohqsg
your array must be of the same type,btohqsg
you're just limiting yourself trying to do that,btohqsg
Actuslly u can just create a function to convert arrays using hash,btohqsg
Not much of an issue there,btohqsg
But idk how else to be able to add users,btohqsg
Or change data in cells for that matter,btohqsg
and how is she going to get a hash function in?,btohqsg
sigh i'll get some sample code,btohqsg
Let ur desired data set lets say int be represented by a char set,btohqsg
So u write a function that can convert int to char for storage,btohqsg
Idk how limited the scope is for cpp for that,btohqsg
is '5int' a size 5 integer?,btohqsg
Fuckkkk my life I totally don't have time for that but I can't just not do it if not I can't move on to code other shit,btohqsg
Doesnt cpp allow int to be stored as string ? Just convert everything to a string,btohqsg
Wa but IDK how to do this in an 'easy' or 'usable' way in C++,btohqsg
Uhhh how TF does one do that,btohqsg
I can tell you for sure,btohqsg
Thats coz shes limited to cpp,btohqsg
I originally wanted to use fstream but pic18 has no file systems :'),btohqsg
Why not use vectors of arrays of 5 ints,btohqsg
But uhh IDK any easier way,btohqsg
No idea  never learnt about it,btohqsg
Basically they have easier addition of members methods,btohqsg
Array needs to prealloc memory I think  so you can never have easy 'addition' of rows to an array,btohqsg
So if you want to add or remove users or rows on the fly I definitely DON'T recommend array,btohqsg
the eeprom has 256 bytes of usable memory,btohqsg
But I haven't learnt that shit,btohqsg
"#include <string.h>#include <stdio.h>#define MAX_LEN 256struct user_t {char id[MAX_LEN];int first;int second;int third;};int main() {user_t arr[MAX_LEN];// Init first userstrcpy(arr[0].id  ""1234567890"");arr[0].first = 0;arr[0].second = 1;arr[0].third = 2;printf(""User is %s  first int is %d  second int is %d  third int is %d""  arr[0].id  arr[0].first  arr[0].second  arr[0].third);}",btohqsg
Even the 4.0 GPA senior said that it's not easy,btohqsg
Paiseh  not int int int  is pair int int  pair int int  size 5 arr int,btohqsg
W h a t is t h i s,btohqsg
doesn't matter whether you use tuple or pair inside the struct anyway,btohqsg
you're basically making your own at this point,btohqsg
@Alexandra_WildeAnyway you should be able to use his boilerplate to make your own from here?,btohqsg
You need change it such that your 2nd thing 3rd thing and 4th thing are what you need,btohqsg
I don't understand it at all,btohqsg
which part do you not understand?,btohqsg
Do u know basics of classes ?,btohqsg
well... that's as much as I can recommend,btohqsg
Ah oo yeah struct seems like baby oop,btohqsg
Then is it Templates which is custom types?,btohqsg
idk  she says she's using cpp  but everything discussed so far is C,btohqsg
yeah templates allow you to initialise the class with whatever class you want,btohqsg
hey structs can even contain function pointers,btohqsg
so you can have functions inside your struct making it more oop,btohqsg
Bruh I still dunno how to use & and * in C++,btohqsg
So you tell me I also bobo,btohqsg
* is still C  but the & one is mysterious to me,btohqsg
i don't use cpp too much anyway,btohqsg
well & is technicall logical AND,btohqsg
but it's also used as an operator to grab memory,btohqsg
in cpp you can do some magic with it to make your function pass by reference without needing to pass pointers around,btohqsg
anyway the code is there  take it or leave it,btohqsg
your original plan of doing everything in 1 array is....,btohqsg
it's possible  but then you might as well be using structs,btohqsg
Must be cuz no vectors in C I guess?,btohqsg
If I remove the first column do u think it's possible to do an array,btohqsg
@andrewomeYou know EEPROM? she doing also apparently,btohqsg
Watch YouTube vids get entertained can liao,btohqsg
Ya I rather not touch also,btohqsg
i did throw a life boey already,btohqsg
All I can say is  I can't help cuz too much hardware/EE,btohqsg
I'll send u a $2 consolation prize since you helped somewhat (although I don't get it at all),btohqsg
Hi yes please save my hypothetical soul,btohqsg
Tldr she wants to make a mini rdbms w cpp,btohqsg
Basically is this.Somehow need to make a mixed type 4-column array,btohqsg
Tuple of 4 ints  tuple of 2 ints  tuple of 2ints  tuple of 5 ints,btohqsg
So I need to do this or some version of this  basically I need something that can store data  can be edited on userend and can add rows for new users,btohqsg
You need a UI for this or?,btohqsg
Wtf doing this on a microcontroller wtf,btohqsg
Your user using the microcontroller or?,btohqsg
wait i am confused why need microcontroller,btohqsg
Cuz her course said so I assume,btohqsg
I don't even wanna be an engineer :'),btohqsg
Bruh not all engineer need do microcontroller,btohqsg
wait ah lemme finish my game then i think about it,btohqsg
At this point I can understand why your group mates give up tbh,btohqsg
I tot she say they write rubbish code,btohqsg
They completely didn't do shit what do u mean,btohqsg
Can I ask original project length,btohqsg
If they knew it wasn't possible they would tell me like 3 weeks ago,btohqsg
and maybe needing to implement your own resizable array,btohqsg
They didn't even care to search until they gave me half assed code to me this afternoon,btohqsg
My project is due TMR 1pm,btohqsg
This should be implementable for ur project,btohqsg
how many users are you supposed to accomodate,btohqsg
and what kind of data we talkkng,btohqsg
and which mc are you using,btohqsg
Theoretically infinite but can cap it,btohqsg
if you want to use mc you definitely need to cap it,btohqsg
As written in the drawing  but the pin can change to all numbers,btohqsg
data as in i assume your mc can handle char input but what kind of dsta,btohqsg
Probably can change to all int,btohqsg
Mixed type array [tuple of 4 int tuple of 2 int tuple of 2 int tuple of 5 int]or some equiv I assume,btohqsg
do you have a choice to like add in components theoretically,btohqsg
It says I have to makefile  pic18 has no file system,btohqsg
iirc my project mates and i wanted to add in a storage because we didn't have enough space to store some hardcoded data,btohqsg
I have to use volatile data,btohqsg
we briefly considered it but we didn't really implement but i think you can do it,btohqsg
Uh what do u mean by that,btohqsg
er wait lemme google and see if it's possible again,btohqsg
I don't think I should waste time on lofty goals rn :'),btohqsg
because considering that your mc has only 256 bytes and even if you use one int for each data then you can only store up to 64 data at any point in time,btohqsg
unless you're going for the 2 bytes int,btohqsg
My math cher gave out 20+ practice papers this year and I am only at 18th,btohqsg
During the holidays my am teacher spam 7 sets of papers,btohqsg
So your whole DB is 2kb?,btohqsg
It's a general chat  O-level peeps came in,btohqsg
I do so many em paper,btohqsg
He gives out 1 a week since Feb,btohqsg
If you have discord it's better  discord multiple channels,btohqsg
I just write by using sine rule x is...,btohqsg
wat tim do yall usually study @,btohqsg
Go any EEE course also need do MAPP anyway what,btohqsg
It's all JC and sec school stuff,btohqsg
My c++ prog don't even fit in 2kb,btohqsg
on weekdays i start work at 930,btohqsg
Go MAE also also need do MAPP,btohqsg
I love that chpt but the numbers annoying,btohqsg
Juz come the discord#techchannel ba  easier talk there,btohqsg
2kb cannot fit db sia unless all int,btohqsg
At least you have code. My grp not even done with a SINGLE LINE LMAO,btohqsg
I go eae to np aerospace eng,btohqsg
what time do y’all sleep omg,btohqsg
But I'm discording my (hopefully soon to be)bf  idw sis :'),btohqsg
if stay up about 1 i guess,btohqsg
i wanna go np but the biz options v little,btohqsg
also next yr we might see fyan,btohqsg
Eh scary but i can answer them,btohqsg
Go anywhere kids just dont go to MI,btohqsg
I went to bed at 11pm in sec1,btohqsg
Go anywhere kids just don't go ENS unless you into math,btohqsg
WE SEE HIM FILMING HIS FOOD VIDS,btohqsg
i damn screwed for core history 2 weeks im not done with half help,btohqsg
His saggy pok pok legit diskarsting shiet,btohqsg
is hist hard lol i wnna take trip sci or pure lit or hist idk,btohqsg
bc my l1r5 for sure more than 15,btohqsg
When I was in sec2  I failed history for the whole year except EOYs,btohqsg
Which channel do I go to for my shit,btohqsg
I dont take hist or lit but,btohqsg
I took pure history chem and phys,btohqsg
But I thought MI welcomes me,btohqsg
Hol up your name seems familiar,btohqsg
lower sec hist is fun ngl,btohqsg
it isn’t hard  content is easy but alot (like srs alot alot)  but u need to know how to ans qns,btohqsg
I take trip science + geo but if lit were offered with trip science  I would have taken it,btohqsg
I got 4 tb to memorise,btohqsg
ya i take pure hist too,btohqsg
How much did you get in the end tho,btohqsg
Trip sci combi sci no difference,btohqsg
It depends actually  if you love sciences and can manage them well based on your experience in sec2  go for it,btohqsg
content fun to learn but not fun to study,btohqsg
Yes but in the end no diff,btohqsg
yep its easier to score a,btohqsg
If Dutch not so retarded we dn to memo so much,btohqsg
It's an atas high level French uni,btohqsg
in sec 2 none of my combi choices had history,btohqsg
i just learn the occupation ibdont bother the names cause too much dates LOL,btohqsg
Anyone planning to take BIO in future,btohqsg
@mayyaaaaaaaaanyway take sec1 as an experimental year to adapt. Don't be so stressed out  it may hinder you from improving,btohqsg
join sch for youth flying club got rejected appeal also rejected then get put into random cca,btohqsg
dw say i scared my senior,btohqsg
U got option to choose depending on your result,btohqsg
turns out badminton for boys only,btohqsg
Who is your math teacher lol,btohqsg
Hillgrove best never forget petition to oust Mrs Chan,btohqsg
how tf am i sec 4 I literally have a mentality of a pri sch student,btohqsg
They didn't mention at all or you didn't know,btohqsg
I thought you grad from sec school liao,btohqsg
i sec 4 i just wna cry,btohqsg
Lol then I guess it is a smart decision to transfer in sec1,btohqsg
