💵 IMPORTANT:Pika World US Debt Ceiling Commentary💰1) Our view is that the success conclusion of the debt ceiling deal will send cheers to the market. That can be the initial euphoria after a tense moment.2) In the immediate term  we are mindful of pull back in the equity market due to crowding out effect. We expect The Treasury having to issue huge volume of bills to replenish their coffers and this could send yield up and add pressure to equity market again.It essentially will pull away liquidity from financial market which would otherwise could pump into the stock market. This scenario could logically play out.So  we caution our friends to keep this idea in the rear mind.Have a splendid trading evening too!,btohqsg
