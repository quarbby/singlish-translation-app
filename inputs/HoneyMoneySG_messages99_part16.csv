Amaze with citi reward (up to 1k)  if u can spend 400 in local and 400 in foreign currency i use ocbc frank for up to 6.67 cashback. I couple uob prefer plat for mobile contactless  uob vs when i need to insert card (need minimum 1k foreign currency spend)I would say half half when it come to contactless payment in korea  most place usually insert card. For one of the best echange rate card can just use ichange and load korean won into it when rate is goodOne thing to note is that airport duty free charge in usd and not korean won if u intend to buy there,btohqsg
Hi All I am new to the forum and I read from the above conversations that HSBC Everyday Global Account can give us 1% rebate for credit card bill payment if we set Giro to pay the bill.I have never had any account with HSBC before  can experts here advise how can this be done please?Thank you.,btohqsg

Hi  can I ask if anyone has used cardup/ipaymy before to pay monthly education loan to CPF?,btohqsg
"1. Open HSBC EGA at a physical branch (preferably as you will need to set-up signature for GIRO payments)  if you hold any HSBC CCs you can only open the account at a physical branch. If you're NTB  you can open the account online but still have to set-up signature for GIRO payments at a physical branch.2. Once account is opened  download the interbank GIRO forms (and business reply envelope  if required) for your other bank CCs from their respective websites.3. Post the interbank GIRO forms and wait for up to 2 months for the GIRO to be processed. An SMS will be received to once your GIRO arrangement is made. Take note the next CC statement will be eligible for the GIRO deduction.Tip: search around with keywords ""pay with DBS CC"" to fully optimise your payments",btohqsg

hi  any thoughts on AMEX singapore airlines krisflyer Ascend CC? is it a good card?,btohqsg
For the current sign up promo for new and existing card holder looks attractive. You can read the review by Mile Lion. For the 2nd year onwards  it is not attractive for my spending habit due to compulsory annual fee.,btohqsg
is it advisable to hold both cashback and miles card? or shld i focus on one,btohqsg
Hi all. For income tax payment via cardup/ipaymy  do i need to disclose personal details (i.e NRIC) to perform the transaction?,btohqsg
Yes  if you are born after 1958. Based on the amounts you have in your RA  less cash top-ups/CPF transfers through RSTU  government grants and the unconditional $5k you can withdraw. So you will need at least $20001 in RA that is from your mandatory contributions  profits from investments and interests  on top of the $5000 unconditional withdrawal (withdrawable at 55)  which is a total of $25001. Reference can be foundhere.Take note that withdrawing from RA will reduce your monthly payouts from CPF Life.,btohqsg
Yes. Your tax reference is your NRIC.,btohqsg
Depends on your goals and how your spending can be split to the different cards.,btohqsg
For this uob promotion Am I eligible if I pay credit card bill payment (non UOB card)  via UOB banking portal ? I did not see the description GIRO-Inward Debit after my payment for the credit card bills via UOB banking portal. I guess not eligible ? Any idea ?,btohqsg
"Does the transaction start with ""Inward DR - GIRO""? My GIRO deductions usually start with that.Now I also feel kuku for not registering for this promo lol.",btohqsg
did u fill up and send interbank giro form?,btohqsg
I clicked on this and submit this form together with my UOB bank account number,btohqsg
Per the terms and conditions  monthly (set up with bank) giro deductions is not applicable for this promotion. Nope my transaction description is BILL Payment xxx.,btohqsg
Anyone facing issues submitting the form for the UOB Big Savings Payout Promotion?,btohqsg
"Read the tnc again. Itdoes notstate that. It states that you must not have any GIRO arrangement on any of your UOB accounts from Oct 23 to Mar 24.You must perform the bill payment viaGIRO form. Transactions starting with ""BILL Payment"" isnotvia GIRO and will not be eligible.",btohqsg
Oh okay. So GIRO form will need to be filled up meaning on and on going basis  giro deduction will happen due to the application solely for this promotion (?). I thought just filling up the participation form suffices. Just wanna be sure.Thanks!,btohqsg
If you already have any GIRO arrangements on any of your UOB accounts before Apr  you can just forgo that part of the promo already.,btohqsg
