Compared to zone 4 walkabout which only gives you access to essentially the concert zone and 4 to 5 standing areas that are always like a can of sardines,btohqsg
This is the cheapest one btw,btohqsg
Apart from that there's seats as well in different areas but different prices and you're stuck to the seat and the zone around,btohqsg
Unless you buy a nicer grandstand which gives you all zone access as well,btohqsg
that shld be fine w me luh  not spending so much on a thing thats not physical at this age,btohqsg
this one all when i older laa haha,btohqsg
But it's an experience to have,btohqsg
if f1 wld still be a thing in the future,btohqsg
Especially if you have friends to go with,btohqsg
wld definitely be for any enthusiast,btohqsg
I think even if you're not into motorsport,btohqsg
Track tv telling you about stuff,btohqsg
And the Singapore gp attracts a lot more tourists than others,btohqsg

So you get to meet all sorts of people,btohqsg
i wish to relive them all the time,btohqsg
