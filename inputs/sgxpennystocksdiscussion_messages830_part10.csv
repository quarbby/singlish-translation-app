WTI crude rose to around $83.333 per barrel now hovering at the highest levels in four months  underpinned by Saudi Arabia and Russia’s announcement that they would extend voluntary supply cuts through next month to bolster oil prices. Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it would extend its 1 million barrels per day production cut for another month  while Russia said it will also reduce its oil exports by 300 000 bpd in September.Saudi Arabia also said its production cuts could be extended beyond September or deepened  catching markets off guard.On the demand side  pro-growth stimulus measures in China and an improved economic outlook in the US provided additional support to crude prices.,btohqsg
