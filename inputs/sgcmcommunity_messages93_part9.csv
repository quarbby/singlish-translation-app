Yes i concur with this  but still there is a way around this  because the car can be under the spouse  children  parents  grandparents name,btohqsg
Don't need the voucher also :),btohqsg
Yuppp  because everyone seems to misunderstand the concept of COE. It's always been to regulate the number of cars on the roads,btohqsg
Actually the govt should open up the forum more often  get more ideas from the public. Im sure there will be a handful that are worth considering,btohqsg
Recently the raised the tax for luxury cars  but people can still afford them  but they dont realise those owners dont contribute to the congestion or car population directly. Most of the ultra luxury cars are not driven daily and parked in landed property. Even if driven daily  they cant drive all 10 cars on the road at the same time,btohqsg
"Most people don't know this but they can email the minister of transport office directly and pass on their suggestions and they usually get a reply back promptly. Playing devil's advocate here but I foresee opening up a forum doing no good as many might have their own agenda to push and might not understand the fundamental idea and push for irrational rules such as the ""one car per household"" etc.",btohqsg
You're right on this  this is why a shift to a more usage based system can help  similar to the classic car coupons. The new road tax system is a good step in this direction,btohqsg
Yes the forum will attract a lot of anwers that has their own agenda and doesnt solve the problem  or worse creates a bigger problem. But im sire there is at least 1 answer that is worth considering,btohqsg
Brother I know you scammer  come after conversation can ah?,btohqsg
I tend to not trust emailing in  tried that before for other agenda and it didnt work haha,btohqsg
Yes it will definitely change things. In fact i feel road tax should be based on a computation of the usage and tonnage of a vehicle.,btohqsg
Hopefully the new ERP system will be a good move at equipping all vehicles for this,btohqsg
Barring the ugly ERP unit we have to put up with,btohqsg
Like seriously if you want to change it  just give us the same one you have designed for motorbikes  it's perfect,btohqsg
No one wants a CDC taxi screen and forced nav in their car,btohqsg
Better yet  just use the rfid like malaysia,btohqsg
Commercial could be charged a flat fee to avoid price fluctuations,btohqsg
This is where separate road tax for phv and taxis can come into play,btohqsg
And could also deter incessant fleet upsizing or upgrading,btohqsg
Just converting to private hire shouldn't be the classification here,btohqsg
They must be associated with some sort of service provider to avail this benefit,btohqsg
Since the commercial cars will be used to travel maybe 50k a year  they could be charged based on that,btohqsg
So if a private car owner is willing to pay that price for a flat fee so be it,btohqsg
I think there could be ways around it  such as registering a company and use the car for private hire,btohqsg
I would rather have a percentage based subsidy for the commerical cars based on association with service provider,btohqsg
Flat fee might be something that's a bit of a benefit for those who would run their car way more than the flat fee mileage,btohqsg
Even if the tax cost are passed down to the consumer  and it become as expensive as japan  maybe more people will consider taking public transport instead,btohqsg
They aren't driving so why pay road tax?,btohqsg
actually road tax is not correct,btohqsg
They're paying a higher ARF  insurance and COE anyway,btohqsg
roadtax is a to cover emissions,btohqsg
The price of those cars could pay off years of road tax in the current system,btohqsg
If u can afford to buy those cars and not drive them  by all means. Nobody is stopping you,btohqsg
bro road tax max nowadays 4k for ferraris  is the ARF that is painful,btohqsg
Doesn't have to be sports car,btohqsg
You park on private property  u dont drive out  win win for the public,btohqsg
So why ev pay more? Lol,btohqsg
i have an answer from the government,btohqsg
So because sports cars are driven less,btohqsg
Doesn't mean they'll all buy sports cars and drive less,btohqsg
Its ok if you dont understand  but if you are driving a point  just say it,btohqsg
In the end based on your logic  everyone drives lesser,btohqsg
the 3.5k road tax is peanut to them,btohqsg
The cars cost a 100 times of that. So what if their road tax drops to 1k instead of current 10k,btohqsg
This is the key point still for Mr Tio who doesn't seem to like performance oriented cars,btohqsg
Yupp  ARF still stays on as the kicker,btohqsg
Driving less=Less road tax for all cars,btohqsg
Why are you making this about people owning sports cars,btohqsg
If you have an agenda against them,btohqsg
Pete recently also did PHV with a car with an 80L tank,btohqsg
