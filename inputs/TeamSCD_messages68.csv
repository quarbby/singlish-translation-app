Not keen on wasting 6k only to realise it’s uncomfortable,btohqsg
No need to spend 6k to know,btohqsg
I need it to make my back seat more roomy,btohqsg
But that’s just me trying to be considerate,btohqsg
The comfortable recaro sportster Cs cost more than 6k for a pair,btohqsg

How’s the comfort over long distances?,btohqsg
Lolx..at this time...I m at offshore base😂,btohqsg
Went all the way to near desaru and it was fine,btohqsg
Any chance you’ve managed to get reference against other buckets and how they compare?,btohqsg
That Facebook post can try asking... Pretty sure some came out of euro r's,btohqsg
Mine is more of a semi bucket,btohqsg
The feller deals with scrap cl7,btohqsg
I've sat in a full bucket but didn't like it,btohqsg
My spoon ECU buy from there,btohqsg
It's basically a remap stock ECU,btohqsg
For those seats in the euro r,btohqsg
Wa tiger Simi also know. Really 👍🏻,btohqsg
That why here to learn mah😁,btohqsg
Power....must see prowess of tuner liao😂,btohqsg
But do sit and try different seats before buying,btohqsg
So Honda Fit can change ecu?,btohqsg
But maybe marginal difference compared to sportster,btohqsg
Just wanna make the rear passengers have some knee room,btohqsg
Fury I m not too sure though,btohqsg
Honestly I don't think you save much space,btohqsg
That wad I trying to say,btohqsg
Actually my friends with similar make  their tillet seats make a huge difference,btohqsg
Oh. Share with me more pls,btohqsg
But full carbon bucket is too much,btohqsg
Same as sitting on wooden planks,btohqsg
I won't spend 6k for passenger comfort,btohqsg
They want to sit behind it's their problem,btohqsg
I ask them take a cab or phv,btohqsg
The 6k I take  do ECU  coilovers  exhaust,btohqsg
Have you driven in bucket seats?,btohqsg
No lol only sat in as passenger for awhile,btohqsg
Best is find others with the same car that has it,btohqsg
If your a bit chunky like me and@NelsonLeong89you won't like it,btohqsg
Tillet not bad ...can try mtm performance for carbon seats .cheaper abit I think,btohqsg
One is abt 2k plus with railing n so on,btohqsg
But semi bucket is the way to go,btohqsg
Carbon seats..I m not sure how durable it is,btohqsg
N sure got creaking sound one,btohqsg
The flexing of the material with weight...,btohqsg
Full bucket seats got sizes de sir😂,btohqsg
Get the one that suit u mah😂,btohqsg
Get the size wrong you regret forever,btohqsg
Long drives I think I prefer normal seats,btohqsg
It is the lower back n waist that suffer,btohqsg
How do you verify if those “refurbished” ones are real btw,btohqsg
The seats shaped in a way you put cushion for back support no use,btohqsg
Long drive...come out of car like 90 yrs old man with back problem,btohqsg
Got a few details can see,btohqsg
It's because I know they get a lot of half cut euro r,btohqsg
It's the stock seat for the euro r,btohqsg
Small ppl like it even more,btohqsg
Lolx  agreed  I m very small man🤭🤭,btohqsg
I got tiny friends who sit in the passenger seat they say very comfy,btohqsg
Fit like a glove the seat 😂,btohqsg
But one thing I hate  the knob,btohqsg
You can't pull a leaver and lie down to rest,btohqsg
Like if want to sleep in car  can forget it,btohqsg

Tillet seats in a swift .erm....,btohqsg
Gtr don't need to care the back,btohqsg

Catless by itself is a problem,btohqsg
