Early repayment for loans is around 3% of the remaining amount  compared to 3-5 years of 5%.It doesn't make sense to keep the full tenure..,btohqsg
And ponzi scheme together...  That's how I crashed,btohqsg
At this situation  you should go with something safer   like what you have now. In case you invest in something riskier and lose it more,btohqsg
The more u eager to get money fast  the easier u lose the money,btohqsg
But with UOB Are you still able to get the interest since you have no salary,btohqsg
The last time I called standard chartered to do a early repayment and the difference only $200+,btohqsg
Any savings is better than none no?,btohqsg
So might as well I keep it for another 1.5 years until it's paid off.,btohqsg
"I use DBS account and transfer myself with ""SAL""",btohqsg
Given that you are unemployed  things might happen that in future you might not be able to repay,btohqsg
Of cos. So I haven't enter any long term investment other than my term/life insurance...,btohqsg
I think the issue with having debt when u can clear it is situtation can change along the year  with no new income  your holding power become weaker when u pump borrow money to investment,btohqsg
Unless the debt is a leverage to increase cash flow that's a different thing,btohqsg
I will try to get a job. But got to work on my resume and it won't be easy because I haven't work for more than 7 years,btohqsg
There are many gig economy if you look hard enough - from 15 to 20.bucks an hour,btohqsg
But if you‚Äôre borrowing money to invest  does your investments actually earn enough to make profit and cover the debt interest?,btohqsg
Even doing relief as a taxi/phv earns you a stable income to offset the interest repayment,btohqsg
Yah better find a job better lah. Want to invest to ‚Äúmake back‚Äù the money will be a disaster. Just slowly lor,btohqsg
So glad with all the inputs. Thanks samsam  Louis  Queenie MT and mr. üçå,btohqsg
Maybe his situation is where he needs to take care of his kids  seeing that he didn‚Äôt work for 7 years. So probably can look at odd hours shift or weekends which is still not so bad as well,btohqsg
Any towkay hiring please let me know üòÇ,btohqsg
My last job 7 years ago have a salary of 7k/month. But I only last 6 months there due to multiple reasons... I was a HR director,btohqsg
Time to come.out of retirement and get to work. It sucks but it is the best solution for now to stop the hemorrhage.,btohqsg
Maybe can call up some of your old contacts and see got any opening lor. I myself am not working anymore but i know if i had to get back to work  i can call some people up. Wont get back same position  but at least something,btohqsg
My son needed me then... And im instructed by the daughter of the CEO to sack all the elderly.. I just can't do it.. I tried getting jobs for them from our competitor,btohqsg
But it's not enough.. she wants me to hire a bunch of youngsters (20s - 30s).,btohqsg
As long as you can still walk and talk  have hands and legs.. there is hope,btohqsg
It's a cleaning industry btw.. no one at SG will take up this kind of job at 20-30s,btohqsg
Like I said  my life is not the norm. They are full of twists and turns...,btohqsg
So back to this.. I am also well verse in construction... So leaving my job as HR director  I can go into construction.. but my eyes doesn't have iris so it hurts so bad in the day.,btohqsg
Hey guys! Anyone know which card is able to get points / cashback for purchasing Rolex with Cortina? I checked HeyMax and seems there's no card listed lol. Thank you!,btohqsg
Unlimited cashback cap... What model are you buying?,btohqsg
Congratulations on being able to get. Rolex,btohqsg
Anyone know if transferring non-FAST SAL from DBS to my 360 OCBC account still works to get better interest? Cos I tried and it doesn't work‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Is this an official statement from XNAP?,btohqsg
Any idea if we could buy ntuc vouchers through fairprice app using amex card?,btohqsg
You tried before and it works for OCBC previously? I recall you can only do that to UOB,btohqsg
What do I have to do,btohqsg
Not really  but I'm not a miles person and I usually use general cashback cards like uob one  hsbc advance  recently added ocbc infinity. For large expenses  I have manhatten. So I don't really need heymax since most of my usual spendings can earn bonus and those that can't  probably won't earn bonus for other cards too.,btohqsg
If you can get same deal at Hour Glass and can fully utilise annual fee go for Amex platinum card.First 16k 6.94 mpd. 16k and above 3.47mpd,btohqsg
Xnap cannot use  internal server error,btohqsg
I though $80 limit for Citibank Cashback?,btohqsg
hi  for people who use EGA giro to pay citi reward ccmy march statement specifies it‚Äôd be deducted via giro  and the due date is 30 April. i transferred into EGA on 25 April  so far it hasn‚Äôt deducted yet and there‚Äôs only 1 business date left before 30 April. it‚Äôs my first statement with giro hence a bit worryif anyone happens to have the same due date  may i know if yours have been deducted?,btohqsg
People always confuse Citi cashback and Citi Cashback+,btohqsg
They will deduct on the due date itself,btohqsg
This is quite accurate. Citi usually deducts one business day earlier,btohqsg
Do uob provide viewing of mab for uob one account?,btohqsg
this morning xnap still down ?,btohqsg
Initially thought it was just a particular store  turns out to be the app lol,btohqsg
Probably if he waits for Amex to issue the card the deal noMore üò™,btohqsg
