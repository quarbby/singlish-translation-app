U need to read ur handouts lol,btohqsg
Basically as long as no one complains  u can send whatever timing u like,btohqsg
First 10 mins of waiting is free  after tt every 10mins u wait  u will be compensated,btohqsg
Where can i get e handouts?,btohqsg
Oodle orders r strict they will call n check on u if u seems to be late,btohqsg
Lala app under profile go help centre,btohqsg
Hi just to chk with u guys on this,btohqsg
When the restaurant says the order is late then u need to livechat,btohqsg
Wah what happened. Dinner hour so little jobs,btohqsg
Tell them the time u arrive,btohqsg
When you reach  do not press pick up. When you waited for 10 mins inform Cs what time u arrive. And when pick up the item infd then too. Then press pick up,btohqsg
I always take picture   picture of time at restaurant  picture of time (if late) of restaurant n food to prove,btohqsg
Sometime  I ask myself why their SOP is so wonderful,btohqsg
They need to fix their lousy live chat first,btohqsg
Actually live chat OK leh. I always can chat with them,btohqsg
This is nonsense laYour arrival is determined by gps and you only need to inform csNo such thing as must live chat the moment u arrive  thats so silly,btohqsg
C.Kyou can try asking same qn to different cso  they will prob tell u something different,btohqsg
Ok noted. Thanks for e advice,btohqsg
All the Cs will say different thing,btohqsg
Their gps koyak what. Sometimes deliver liao practically in front of the house swipe to complete job says I'm too far from destination 🙄,btohqsg
This morning alrdy sense something wrong lol,btohqsg
Hmm... it’s best to contact support once the pick up is late .,btohqsg
Then if your driving MPV you will be upgraded . That’s the problem   only if you drive higher tier you can get upgraded . So if you drive a car you can only catch bike jobs and get upgraded to car .,btohqsg

Always get location far away from actual position...8km or more away.,btohqsg
Not sure but always get pick up 8km or more. Only sometimes get near position,btohqsg
