oh ya!!! Cos i'm just thinking how can i fully maximise the CPM card when i'm overseas as well!,btohqsg
i would rather use citi rewards + amaze instead of CPM   CPM the MPD not worth it,btohqsg
but i realised that Citi rewards is good if i'm constantly shopping online every month + taking grab most of the time. Else if i don't do this  it doesn't really help in my situation right!,btohqsg
so for how citi rewards + amaze card works is that   amaze will convert everything to online spendingSo thats why people call it CRMC + amaze combo,btohqsg
righttttt! yes i did see on the youtube videos before that honey money made!,btohqsg
so even tapping your amaze card for paywave  it will be converted to online spending,btohqsg
so is it safe to say that if i were to have CRMC + amaze together  every paywave i do i just have to use the amaze card to clock online spending?,btohqsg
Wow thank you guys so much for the inputs! Helps alot! One last question  will you guys pair the CRMC + Amaze (for day to day spending)  as well as CPM (for overseas spending eg  hotels/flight tickets etc) to maximise earning miles? üòÅ,btohqsg
CRMC will not earn for travel  incl hotel,btohqsg
so CPM will cover for that right!,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  any suggestion for upcoming t bill competitive bid yield? Thanks,btohqsg
Bid at the rate u can accept? If u cannot accept anything at 3.49 and below  then bid 3.5. If for some reason u jus wan to get it no matter wat  then jus put 1%.,btohqsg
will not use CPM for hotel/flight,btohqsg

ohhhh what will you use for that!,btohqsg
how about the normal UOB Lady's card if i'm unable to apply for Solitaire!,btohqsg
for travel / hotel spending i would rather use some other cards to clock that spendingCPM too meh already,btohqsg
cos i applied for both CPM and CRMC now and i'm confused what to do with CPM alr HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Use it for free lounge lol,btohqsg
CPM just keep it there  after 6 month / 1 year cancel,btohqsg
will there be any charges if i were to cancel?,btohqsg
early cancellation yes  i think most card early cancel is 6 mths,btohqsg
so if i were to hold it for 1 year shouldn't be an issue right  just scared if i don't use the CPM and they charge me the annual fee and i am not able to waive it off,btohqsg
normally will waive off   as you are using the CRMC alsoIf cant waive off just cancel,btohqsg
Keep for priority pass lorh or Citi Payall,btohqsg
Can just keep CPM for 2 free priority pass visits,btohqsg
that's what i was thinking as well!,btohqsg
but do get another card for hotel / flight expenses,btohqsg
which will be the UOB lady's card right since it's 6mpd,btohqsg
6mpd until end of this month only. Back to 4mpd in April. Still better than most cards.,btohqsg
Any suggestions on other cards for hotels/airplane tickets that i can possibly get!,btohqsg
i dont like UOB ladies because of this :UNI$ expire 2 years from the last day of each periodic quarter in which the UNI$ was earned. Each UNI$ period is calculated commencing from January to December of each calendar year. Expired UNI$ cannot be replaced or reinstated.,btohqsg
What are you keeping UNI$ more than 2 years for?,btohqsg
before the end of the 2yrs expiry u can transfer into KF for an extra 3yrs expiry date  making it a total of 5yrs,btohqsg
"cause my spending is not that high to clock enough uni$ for something ""good""",btohqsg
"I dunno your situation but need to be aware of what spending you do to make any meaningful return whether cashback or miles.With that said  it's a myth that one needs to have high spending to get something ""good"". The game is about being aware of spending and optimizing that spend.",btohqsg
cause currently for my case  i am spending on evol 600$ a monthany extra would be directed to my CRMC AMAZE. I rarely have any hotel / flight expenses. which CRMC amaze will cover my ass more   as i tend to eat out / buy stuff from shopee / lazada,btohqsg
cause i also thought of spending 25$ to transfer the miles over to my KF account  if the miles amount is too little. then spending 25$ to transfer that little amount of miles is not that worth it,btohqsg
yes i transfer mine over when it hits a minimum of 25kUNI$ only,btohqsg
i barely spend 1k a year in hotel / flights   so in my case not as worth it to get the uob ladies. i would rather go with a more generic card like hsbc revo,btohqsg
The beauty of uob card is that it pull together all uob miles card,btohqsg
Any tips for this situation? Cos I would maybe only travel 2-3 times a year  sometimes even lesser! Not sure if like what wz shared  might defeat the purpose of UOB Lady‚Äôs card!,btohqsg
actually i just read that uob ladies  travel category includes flights + hotels  so actually can consider it,btohqsg
so technically i can haveEVOL  (day to day use )CRMC + AMAZE  ( after exceeding EVOL)UOB LADY card  ( for hotel / flights expenses only),btohqsg
you need to reframe your question.You want card that can cover your hotel/airplane ticket purchase or you want card that earns points/cashback for your spends to reach your goal? Whatever that may be.See the big picture first and then see where your spends are  then cover those.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm leaning more towards cards that can maximise the points! So sorry for the vague question! üòÖ,btohqsg
i not sure if your expenditure is the same as mine  my monthly spend is usually between 600$ - 1k. but this is based on my spending habits also,btohqsg
I think can watch this video first then gather your thoughtshttps://youtu.be/T0dtcQXhDXs?si=y8VzekKZ_Us93m4C,btohqsg
Got it thank you so much! üôèüèª really appreciate it!,btohqsg
