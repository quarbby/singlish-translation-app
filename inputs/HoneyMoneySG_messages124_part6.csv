Currently hv Amex krisflyer CC. is it advisable to switch to Citi cc with amaze?,btohqsg
don't have to switch entirely. Use the citi cc with amaze for general spend less travel spend. Keep the Amex krisflyer for travel spend and Amex pay for hawkers,btohqsg
Oic. Cos the annual fees for Amex very high so tot of terminating it..tks,btohqsg
Yes.. principal card holder will be able to see supp card holder spend reflected immediately under Pending transaction under principal card holder account.,btohqsg
Do you have the blue amex KF or the ascend? You can always keep the card till they charge AF then ask to waive. If AF not waived  just cancel.,btohqsg
If were to terminate  any losses like miles or anything?,btohqsg
No loss cuz all your miles are already transfered to KF account. For ascend version  I heard it's bit harder to waive as it has more benefits.,btohqsg
Hi would I still be able to earn max miles if I book hotel viatrip.combut pay at hotel? Thanks.,btohqsg
Heard can but try to opt out of the free hotel stays among other perks. Anyway  amex can't be used for a couple of merchants..,btohqsg

Anyone knows the fastest way to clock in uob one‚Äôs spending by 31st July? Miscalculated and missing just a few bucks üòÆ‚Äçüí®ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
i think 7-11 post quite fast   you need to post before 31july to be safe,btohqsg
Yeap  sometimes the pending can be stuck for days,btohqsg
use physical card at uob$ merchants,btohqsg
So far all my 7-11 transactions post on same day.,btohqsg
So do $162 payment and enable 5% allocation to insurance .And then make another $4k payment and disable 5% allocation to insurance.And then completely ignore the usual method to pay to insurance as you use the registered credit card on lifestyle activities,btohqsg

Hi there everyone  am trying to use cardup to pay some of my monthly expenses to earn some miles from it. Particularly for car loan. I have an existing car loan with DBS and it‚Äôs currently deducting the monthly payment on the 8th of every month. If I use cardup for the repayment of the loan  do I have to set the repayment to be earlier than the 8th so that the auto deduction from giro does not take place? And if so how early should I be setting the payment date? Any experiences that anyone has with this would be much appreciated. Thanks!,btohqsg
What 3 buy trades did you all do for the sign up rewards? Thank you in advance,btohqsg
Do you all know which credit card is best for using to pay car loans from banks?,btohqsg
Whats the max amount of replacementtill you think its time to close the account? Its going to be my 4th card now to change due to fraudulent transactions. Its always citibank. Use it to clock miles for insurance and sp bills via citipayall,btohqsg
Any other banks has same function as citipayall. The reason i stick with citipayall cause can earn rewards for paying SP bills. Cardup dont have SP services,btohqsg
why not just pay on SP app without fee?,btohqsg
I thought SP Bills cannot earn card rewards?,btohqsg
SCB Journey can earn mpd without any payment facility for utilities,btohqsg
some cards can earn rewards for utilities,btohqsg
Ouh. Journey card able to if pay via SP app? Thats interesting. How about card up? I assume it can as well?,btohqsg
there are other cards with higher mpd for cardup,btohqsg
Yea. I think highest is 1.5 right? Most 4mpd got excluded? Like wwmc. For now i have citi PM/citi rewards/ hsbc rev/dbs wwmc/ scb journey,btohqsg
then sticking to your last card mentioned would be best in order to free up spending for your other cardsüòä,btohqsg
Kinda sick and tired of citi frequent fraudulent charges. So if SCB can do it  i might as well migrate to that and cancel my citi PM,btohqsg
