itâ€™s just the most flexible and simple,btohqsg
pythonSch teaches you C and C++But you might as well learn others,btohqsg
in my engineering work previously  we use both C++ and python.Python was for the communication and information transfer between different devicesBut one of the machines run on C++ mainly  so it feeds the python program the info to transmit to other machines or softwares,btohqsg
Would say very goal-dependent if it's purely out of an interest of learning though. You don't really pick up very strong OOP skills with python (though you could argue that other paradigm have become more prominent).Java isn't very well recommended but it is still not a bad place to start  especially since it has very mature package/build systems and is rooted strongly in OOP,btohqsg
Python is certainly one of the easiest to get up and running with but I wouldn't say it's the best for learning imo (is essential if looking into data science/AI/ML fields),btohqsg
This is from a hobbyist/student perspective,btohqsg
itâ€™s ofc goal dependent. python gives the easiest introduction while C++ teaches you more low level skills that might take you longer initially. canâ€™t go wrong with either but i generally recommend python,btohqsg
canâ€™t ever recommend java for a first one with how specialised it tends to be,btohqsg
My experience with java has been that it's pretty crucial in understanding the design choices of many other languages simply due to how influential it has been.Not the greatest or easiest language to start with  I can agree with that.,btohqsg
if u go nus I think you can't avoid it,btohqsg
I recommend python for first timer,btohqsg
thatâ€™s more of a statement about python being easy to learn,btohqsg
simple python programs looks very similar to pseudocode / natural language in structure  so the learning curve for newcomers is much less steep.,btohqsg
its okie i just enjoy mocking it ðŸ˜‹,btohqsg
yes thank you matcha for helping,btohqsg
It does get somewhat more painful when you are trying to push python further. Ingesting large amounts of data is not as convenient unless you use specific libraries with c bindings  etc.Different languages play different roles. C++ & Java is great if someone is interested in learning programming for the sake of learning programming.Python is a fun time for beginner Projects. JS as well if looking at web (Backend and Frontend) projects  though that's a completely different rabbit hole,btohqsg
you miss learning about type safety and certain concepts when starting with python since it's less opiniated of a language  imo,btohqsg
if they are learning as a beginner 95% of the time they will end up touching/transitioning into web development so python is completely valid for web as well,btohqsg
i mean my teacher also recommends python for first timers,btohqsg
are u still in land of freedom,btohqsg
fuck it LOL there wasn't anyth that good about it,btohqsg
but I'm going again next year,btohqsg
yeah land of freedom is awfully average country,btohqsg
really got shown a new world LOL,btohqsg
yeah for real my friend in land of freedom too then she was saying its like so basic country,btohqsg
thought NYC was supposedly already the fucking best,btohqsg
waste money sia the flight so ex,btohqsg
no? NYC is known for things like what you saw,btohqsg
every state is almost like its own country,btohqsg
@Immordredso what did you do in slum land,btohqsg
he learned to jump subway gantry,btohqsg
gonna try it in sg alr,btohqsg
My discipline master go to the toilet to check,btohqsg
but other than that nth much leh,btohqsg
maybe should have joined us instead,btohqsg
so im just flying over to osaka on 28 to meet my friends there,btohqsg
She probably trapped in the crowd,btohqsg
why did you take C instead of X... Hmm,btohqsg
over here its -5 on a good day,btohqsg
yeah i always asked him abt this over the last 2 years too,btohqsg
C in Chemistry stands for clown ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
yea its fine once u get used to it,btohqsg
but the amt of snow is crazy,btohqsg
i keep my pfp until 2024,btohqsg
I keep my pfp till the end of my life,btohqsg
apparently he wanted to come to mine lol,btohqsg
YOOO that was like in the 2000 or smth,btohqsg
I miss when flash was still ard,btohqsg
Cause only then u can play free online comp games,btohqsg
Papa Louie games was the bomb,btohqsg
