Does crmc get miles on cardup for insurance?,btohqsg

I have HSBC Premier MasterCard which gives 5% for dining (extra 1% if I qualify for Everyday+). Should I pair it with Instarem Amaze for overseas dining spend? Then I can earn InstaPoints due to FX spend  and also dining spend under HSBC Premier eligible category,btohqsg
Some overseas dining may have different mcc  but should be not many too,btohqsg
Anyone have any recommendations for credit card to use for dental? ESP Q&M? I know most dental services are excluded for rewards.,btohqsg
Most contactless cards ok. can get 4mpd for mobile contactless on uob ppv or 6.67% on uob evol etc,btohqsg
Hi shifu. For those that sign up for UOB Prvi. The two consecutive months need to be two full months apart or as long itâ€™s different months  it works?,btohqsg
Iâ€™m surprised u said that. My experience is most cards are ok for dentist.Itâ€™s hospitals that are excluded.,btohqsg
If it is a dental clinic within a hospital  itâ€™s MCC likely is 8062 n excluded.If it is NDCS or those private clinics such as Q&M  its MCC is 8021. DBS Livefresh or UOB PPV should be ok. If you decide to use UOB EVOL  remember to use ApplePay or GooglePay because EVOL Visa Paywave contactless only give 0.3%. Instead of 6.67%(8%).,btohqsg
Hi this is UOB quarterly rebate chart. I not very sure but i think it means every 3 month we receive $50 if we spend above $500 for 3 month?,btohqsg
Then why people use UOB 1 card? OCBC every month can collect $80. 3 months means OCBC can collect $240 whereas UOB collect only $50,btohqsg
What is this link/page? Looks wrong? $300 per quarter?,btohqsg
This seems outdated and already replaced.,btohqsg
$80 for which ocbc card? limited category spending? higher min spend requirement?Anyway uob one card can get bonus cashback for specific merchants. And clocks to card spend for bonus interest on uob one account.,btohqsg
https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/one_card_full_tnc.pdf?s_cid=grm:sg:paid:sea:go:na:tx:na:001843:010423-evergreen:bau:na:ms-sg&vid=ms-sg&ms=grm:sg:paid:sea:go:na:tx:na:001843:010423-evergreen:bau:na:ms-sgThis is the more accurate latest tnc for uob one card.,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I just realised the PDF i looking was 2015,btohqsg
Hi seems like the quarter rebate is still $50 if we spend $500 for 3 months for UOB card.Whereas OCBC we need to spend $800 for max $80 rebate for each month.,btohqsg
no lah  need to spend more than $800 to get $80  not 10% rebate lah,btohqsg
As a young adult  any recommended AMEX card? Currently only use Citi PremierMiles (almost all expenses) and OCBC 360 (because of work),btohqsg
Hey allCan I confirm Maybank giving 3.33% CB for insurance payment?If yes then if I use cardup to pay the insurance at 2.25%  I will make a balance of 1.08% CB?,btohqsg

Sorry for the newb question.Is there any cap or possible to swipe instarem amaze paired with Citibank reward card  to purchase luxury goods cost >10k?,btohqsg
