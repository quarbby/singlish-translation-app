🎉Pika World Daily Review – 2 Sept 2022🎉📉Renewed fears in the market🧸The market has a lot to digest on Thursday. China's economy received a new blow as the country began the lockdown of its fourth largest city to combat the flares of new Covid cases. It certainly hit on risk on sentiments when the Fed is also taming inflation.China's latest action has a profound effect. After all  in the past decade  it represents a more significant proportion of global growth than the combination of the US  Europe and Japan. Its economy has always been the pillar of support when other regions are in a downturn. In this instance  its economy is also wobbling given the harsh lockdown while less inclined to usher in the massive stimulus.There is a silver lining  though. A major lockdown can push back China's economic recovery and potential reduce oil demand which helps to alleviate the rise in oil price that feeds inflation hike.💣The chips just got roasted⏳It's wartime. Nvidia and AMD stocks took a hit  given that the US government had informed them of a new licensing requirement that is taking effect immediately. This affected Nvidia's A100  and it soon to be released H100 products to countries like China.The company is actively engaging its China's client to plan their future purchases and explore other products if possible.Essentially  the A100 chips are used in data centres to help power AI  and data analytics works. AMD face collateral damages on sentiments even as the company does not see a significant effect on its business.Again  Pika World will look at possible entry points  though mildly  as we see significant risks in the equity market.📪What's on the menu today?🧰At 8.30 pm  we will welcome the most anticipated piece for the week  the Nonfarm payroll. We expect it to cool to 300K from a high of 528K in the prior period. The unemployment rate should maintain at 3.5%.It is significant as market participants are betting that a weaker showing in job reports may still encourage the Fed to be less aggressive in its rate hike.Comparing factory orders  growth on a monthly basis will be released at 10 pm  and a growth of 0.2% is expected  a moderation from 2.0%.It is 2 Sept  Friday at 9.05 am in Singapore and 9.05 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a sunny weekend ahead!,btohqsg
