Do you know if the payment service processor is located in sg or abroad?,btohqsg

Nice! Thank you for the information  but do you have to spend alot on the card? I was reading the T&C's  actually they will award 15000Highflyer miles if we spend $10K per year. That average out to be around $834/month.So If I can get a waiver from their annual by spending 10k a year and will received 15k Highflyer miles  sound okay leh,btohqsg
It's a good card for low spenders  but Diners Club is less accepted than Amex. They have their Diners club app which you can use to pay at hawkers with DCS logo,btohqsg
Oh another question  will I qualify for my Krisflyer elite Sliver if I transfer my Citi premier miles to my Krisflyer account? Will transfering of miles works?,btohqsg
it's actually a UnionPay card. which isn't very well accepted too. Anyway UnionPay and Diners use the same payment network,btohqsg
oh wait I got confused with the other card which is an unlimited 2% cashback card,btohqsg
I’m spending around 2k a month I would say  more or less.I think if you spend around 1k a month should be fine,btohqsg
"Hi folks  can I check for DBS Altitude Visa Card  is it real that i get 10 miles per SGD 1 Spend? because I see here ""At a Glance"" says so sweet at caption but yet scrolled down to below become SGD 1 spend = 3 miles on online flight & hotel transactions.",btohqsg
"more specifically  it says ""up to""but it all depends on which promotion is currently going on",btohqsg
oh  found out it's the 10 miles is to Kaligo platform only.,btohqsg
"Credit card benefits are more ""click-baity"" than YouTube titles. The more you see  the more you learn",btohqsg
