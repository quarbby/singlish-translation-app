H3 Math is what pure math looks like,btohqsg
Fm is still almost all computational,btohqsg
(Sorry for sending a long message)Actually  it depends on how one is usingLike I'm studying Materials Science course. I learnt about different kinds of materials  including different types of plastic materials.It can be true that single-use plastic bags are more eco-friendly than cotton and paper bags because they are actually reusable and recyclable (while cotton bags cannot be recycled and paper bags are not so eco-friendly because they are actually from trees - we don't have enough trees already). However  many people prefer using plastic bags for throwing the rubbish.In Singapore  once one is using plastic bags for throwing the rubbish  that plastic bag cannot be recycled anymore because of contamination. Moreover  they will just burnt the whole bag of rubbish (including that plastic bag)  which can produce dioxin gas (a type of toxic gas).More and more dioxin gas will be produced from burnt plastic bags which may cause climate change or anything that can be harmful to the environment  unless either people want to reuse the plastic bags as many times as possible before those plastic bags get recycled or just bring reusable bags.Think about one thing. How were the people in the past able to throw their rubbish without plastic bags?,btohqsg
No need to sorry haha  thanks for your insight. I shared the article cos I thought it was a known fact   just like how we know that metal straw produce way more greenhouse gases as compared to plastic straw  and it can only be offset if the metal straw is reused at least like 100+ times or smt. So I'm like do u really need 3 researcher to do research to get this result,btohqsg
H3 is much more abstract  and helps you much less,btohqsg
"HmmThat's true. Don't understand why need researchers to do research to get this result.Feel like they just want to produce more plastic bags just ""for fun"".",btohqsg
