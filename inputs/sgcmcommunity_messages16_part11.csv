Me too Mr Arnav. Clean lines and a very refreshing change from the excessive bumper sculpting and addition of non-functional body vents which seems to be the norm these days.,btohqsg
Yes Mr Shane. The throwback design elements is just so elegantly executed.,btohqsg
Good for those who like a simple stock look or those who want to do extreme body kits,btohqsg
