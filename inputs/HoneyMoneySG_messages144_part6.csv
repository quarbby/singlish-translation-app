For Citi reward CC  NTUC voucher or some other vouchers consider as eligible min spending of $500 upon card approval?,btohqsg
Thank you. I am hitting an error that says 'Opps! Looks like something went wrong. Tap on reload to try again'.I've uninstalled and restart phone  to no avail 😔,btohqsg
Wouldn't it be faster to just WhatsApp them and check?,btohqsg
"Don't feel so ""guaranteed"" now with such patterns  do they 👀",btohqsg
I sent an email too and received an auto reply that their customer service operhours are Mon-Fri 9am-6pm. Perhaps the same applies to WhatsApp too hence no response,btohqsg
Hi all  I am trying to use webull sg to buy some ETF  but couldn't go through when I sign. DK how to use webull...,btohqsg

Webull no strategy except csp and cc. U can’t do naked put,btohqsg
A general feedback on dcs service. Received bill with charge for card renewal. Paid my outstanding dues and WhatsApp their number to cancel card. No response. Call their customer service. Got in third time and told them I want to cancel card. After one month  still got bill with late interest charge. So for those want to cancel dcs card  you may need to be persistent in getting them to cancel the card.,btohqsg
Persistent to cancel card... that seems so wrong.. seems they are so hard up to hang onto customers...,btohqsg
Why is that so? Care to elaborate? I'm new to Amaze card. Just sign up.. I guess I have missed out the fun for quite long..,btohqsg

Hi everyone  am looking to get a miles card to collect some miles for my flight & hotel as I’ll be travelling to a few places next year. Can anyone recommend some decent cards?I will mainly be using the card for flights/accoms/big item purchases because my daily card in sg would be UOB One. I also intend to collect some miles once I hit the $500 spending on my UOB One.Most of my spendings are from online platforms like Shopee and dining out at restaurants.Appreciate any advice please  thank you!! 🙏🏼,btohqsg
Used UOB PPV and paid through Singtel website but dont have 9X bonus 🥲,btohqsg
Is the mcc white listed for Uob ppv online payments?,btohqsg
HeyMax AI says singtel is MCC code 4814 which I can’t find any info on it under the PPV T&C  not under selected online and not under excludedAnyone managed to get 4mpd on singtel here?,btohqsg
To answer your question properly  not in white list should be your understanding. Don’t get it confused with not in exclusion.,btohqsg
Does withdrawal or TNG topup counted for the Cashback?,btohqsg
Morning all.Is my understanding rightUob ppv capped at 1.1k to get 4 miles.While the visa signature is min 1k capped at 2K?,btohqsg
hey guys  my mom is looking to buy a new fridge  $900-1200  from courts. the salesperson recommended her to sign up for DCS Courts CC to get 29.90 off (i think it's for delivery and disposal charges). she's not working so i will have to sign up for it. i checked  this card gives 2% cashback. i currently hold CRMC and UOB Lady's (undecided on cashback/miles just accumulating the points now; the not really applicable ones are OCBC Infinity  SC Smart and Trust) and card expenditure is usually < 500 a month. was thinking if this DCS card could be the best deal for this one off purchase  or there are better alternatives,btohqsg
DCS Cashback for 5% cashback with min. spend $400.,btohqsg
yeah been looking at that for awhile! i dont think DCS will have sign up promotions right? e.g.  singsaver promotions,btohqsg
what are your other cc you have? some other cc can buy courts vouchers,btohqsg
Which credit to apply now?Is the best of all,btohqsg
dont think any applies 😂CRMC + AmazeUOB Lady's (still in quarter of Travel)Trust Cashback (still in quarter of Food)OCBC InfinitySC Smarti did some calculations i think DCS Cashback is the best and for future spendings,btohqsg
Should get a card for miles or cash back? Which is more worth it?,btohqsg
Yes. Maybe Sir Alex was invited to apply.And if it's not clear  it's a joke. It's like asking which is the best house to buy in Singapore.,btohqsg
Which one more worth depends on individual,btohqsg
Ah sorry im still recovering from last night,btohqsg
Among ur selection of cc  ya dcs could be good. However  does dcs cashback have cap?,btohqsg
So it will be capped at 1k spend.,btohqsg
issue is very few places accept diners club card,btohqsg
