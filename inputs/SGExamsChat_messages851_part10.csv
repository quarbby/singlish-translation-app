ðŸ˜… kinda true to an extent   Poly allows academically inclined students to get extra mods for extra points,btohqsg
But not the case in JC given the workload   they treat all students as academic inclined by definition or by default,btohqsg
i think its reasonableyou need to mug hard enough to enter jc,btohqsg
yup considering whether to apply fr plp,btohqsg
"""All students suffer together"" is disagreeable",btohqsg
Someone stole my H2 Physics notebook :(,btohqsg
definitely not what james lee gotta do,btohqsg
man talked through 210 slides like it was nothing  as if i dont have to go back and read it myself,btohqsg
i needa get radiotherapy after hearing him talk,btohqsg
That's the mod i plan on taking nxt yr,btohqsg
So I a bit too exaggerated?,btohqsg
after this sem i'll let you know how it goes,btohqsg
I swear being in modules with 5 students is no fun,btohqsg
my biophysics mod only had 5 people,btohqsg
The sad part is all 5 ppl i dont even know,btohqsg
and we were just merry go round around the centre tutorial table,btohqsg
Intro to spintronics.Soft condensed matter phy.,btohqsg
no i dont even remember their names,btohqsg
We are effing far apart sia,btohqsg
apparently he tried open quantum systems,btohqsg
and noped tf out in 30 mins,btohqsg
D*nl sad cus M*** in 2 modules,btohqsg
what did my prof do to him,btohqsg
No but i see him more as a biophy peeson,btohqsg
He rather do anatomy than quantum,btohqsg
i see him as a bufflord,btohqsg
He is effing buff and plays sports,btohqsg
He is more towards sports and health physics i swear,btohqsg
wait iestin why did this guy give up in 30 mins ...,btohqsg
but sometimes reddit has a lot of above 70rp students,btohqsg
idk thats all the info he told me,btohqsg

Well all i know is M*is in 2 of the classes he went to,btohqsg
Hmm yeah definitely   a lot can handle this kind of load,btohqsg
How can yall not like soft condensed matter tho ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Is food physics and biophysics ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
i promised myself i will not take any more physics mods than necessary,btohqsg
none of them going to be physics i promise you,btohqsg
nah i thought about that but,btohqsg
Meanwhile i learnt that I am a racist in spintronics,btohqsg
Which used magnetism for navigation across the world first?A) ChineseB) EuropeansC) Others,btohqsg
Well magnetism discovery is ancient I think,btohqsg
No but it is magnetism for navigation,btohqsg
You mean utility of the magnetic poles to guide ships ?,btohqsg
how do yall try to study when yall tired,btohqsg
i took a shower and im still tired,btohqsg
I slept from 11pm to 10 am,btohqsg
And I have been very sleepy during spintronics lecture,btohqsg
Same   even at work I under burnout consistently,btohqsg
Not even milo helped me at all,btohqsg
