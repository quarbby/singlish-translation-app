Wah really ah.. like that boh pian juz do lah..,btohqsg
Hi can i check why do i always see bike orders and not car orders as im driving a car?,btohqsg
Cos there are more bikes orders & fewer car jobs get snatched up super fast by hungry car drivers,btohqsg
Ah thanks alot for the claification boss!,btohqsg
Guys  check with you all. Lala cannot stack orders? I wana stack another job apps say I have a job within 40mins,btohqsg
Yah cannot stack. Need to clear then get new job,btohqsg

Alright gonna start also la follow you guys' lead. All the best to all of us today üí™,btohqsg
Holy.shit man hahaha sometimes too fast also headache,btohqsg
Actually just start to be curious  mostly biker here or driver here,btohqsg
About to ask the same Q,btohqsg
I'm a driver. 98% of my orders are bike orders.,btohqsg
Actually to me doesn't matter much bro.. all of us is on the same ship..,btohqsg
All of us here are making a living,btohqsg
No hate between drivers and riders here. üëç,btohqsg
Driver bro  yeah just try to get a living out of it only. Hahaha.,btohqsg
And I can relate when riders feedback that order sizing is too big for bikes. Some of them are ridiculous. One particular restaurant at Cathay yestetday had hot tray of pasta and 2 full bags of food.,btohqsg
Nah no hater bro  just that sometime driver abit mad because no car order. Which make us lugi more on petrol.,btohqsg
Actually gojek also same la. Drive around here and there just to get ping. Lol,btohqsg
What to do. Now everything also very bad. Llm cs also one kind only. Side thier customer and we all suffer one,btohqsg
Customer are the one bring in their dough,btohqsg
Yes not wrong  but bring down the market to everyone. Llm currently is the biggest. So if they show this way the rest will follow the same way too. Not as easy to earn a living too üòÇ,btohqsg
For bike llm rates r better?,btohqsg
Have u guys seen Uparcel rates ü§£,btohqsg
Go apply for ryde send. Less competition,btohqsg
Can die the rate is as good as those working in DHL and ninja van,btohqsg
