Time to send to my CJ friend la cb,btohqsg
usually the people ik who take h1 math with h2 bio are those who failed ip math so the school doesnt allow them to take h2 math,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs a girl tell her she‚Äôs brave,btohqsg
oops the 10th pic is uncropped,btohqsg
ya then this idiot keeps on mentioning me EVEN AFTER I LEFT THE SERVER,btohqsg
@whatisgrassbut Med doesnt have a h2 maths requirement,btohqsg
oh wait this is tekkis server,btohqsg
Acjc allow students to take h2 physics with h1 math,btohqsg
So h1 math with H2 biochem can still go med/dentistry,btohqsg

Like do they even think before they type,btohqsg

"""so instead of jerking off after marriage just go and jerk off at level 6 staircase""- cjc motto",btohqsg
Mi/yi I not sure which is worse,btohqsg
I only know tekki as a cringe kid,btohqsg

Oh so like my himecut and twintails,btohqsg
My friend in BCMe complain abt how H2 bio no lect,btohqsg
Like what‚Äôs the full story that make CJC like that,btohqsg
He straight up insulted me and somehow he banded up with other cringe kids and got me banned on a sg server,btohqsg
Used to have high preggo rate or smth,btohqsg
How could I forget Yishun is even famous for having cows in the lifts,btohqsg
rae can u answer in the funorama gc,btohqsg
oh i seeactl i also wanna grow out my back hair until after a levels,btohqsg
No clue last i heard he wanted go TP psychology,btohqsg
I hear their notes also very bad,btohqsg
like i mean i always wanted longer hair but my mom didnt let me in jh then now she a bit more lax,btohqsg
i have to cut the front every 3 months or it covers my eyes,btohqsg
my econs friends are hating econs. im so glad i took history,btohqsg
He alr spend money for us thats why,btohqsg
my history cher is a massive W,btohqsg
no cause like when it grows past a point she will say that the hair keep dropping on the floor and drag me to the aunty to cut,btohqsg
but since last year after hcl o lvl i told the hairdresser to cut my ends and my mom also cant rly do anything about it,btohqsg
üò≠üò≠ my moms friend work there and my mom always ask me go there,btohqsg
He and a few others that wanted tp psych in sec 4 only decided to start volunteering,btohqsg
surprisingly it turns out decent leh,btohqsg
For H1 got Singapore  many other countries since they talk about UN and Cold War. But they talk more about China US USSR,btohqsg
yeah the gender ratio is crazy,btohqsg
anyway im prob gonna grow out my hair until ... actl idk lol.will prob cut the ends when i feel like it,btohqsg
H1 only have Vietnam iirc since its under CW,btohqsg
but  when i was a kid i always wanted like waist length hair,btohqsg
bro i said probably i haven't heard from him in a year,btohqsg
i got my hair cut there and it looks decent  idk why yall say snip avenue is bad/genuine,btohqsg
Oh isn‚Äôt similar to sec school,btohqsg
He just damn cringe and made a few personal attacks on me bef,btohqsg
When i didn't say sht abt him,btohqsg
Meanwhile that Xy guy in the other chat took 5H2,btohqsg
tekki just talks shit when you give ONE ridiculous take,btohqsg
I thought maybe got Ukraine history,btohqsg
Not rly. Don‚Äôt rly talk about ww2 in h1 or h2,btohqsg
this dude cannot accept apologies even if you make minor mistakes,btohqsg
"if u say ""i don't hear metal""",btohqsg
this guy is gonna execute you like xi jinping,btohqsg
but tbh@juicecogensone side of my hime cut is slightly thicker than the other even though i alr ask the aunty to fix it so ngl i think she isnt the best at doing himecutand then last time i ask her cut like 1cm off my ends she cut off alot then i was damn pissed,btohqsg
ooh alot of ppl take that in acjc,btohqsg
Is he still the same tho,btohqsg
then again its not very visible that one side is thicker so i just close one eye,btohqsg
What I only knew of 2 others doing that,btohqsg
oh i think GCEm/GCMe more pop,btohqsg
Even tho got geog and hist,btohqsg
I hated geog more but got A  then history which I liked got C,btohqsg
tekki said he did well for o levels but people here seem to disagree,btohqsg
ik he eae but i heard rejected,btohqsg
Ya lo my a levels the subjects I hate I do well but those I love end up no A,btohqsg
guys i just learnt today that KI can be used as your contrasting subject,btohqsg
Yes it‚Äôs a subject of its own category,btohqsg
i thought Ki only replaces GP,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not even considered an arts subject,btohqsg
I gave one of his friends advice for eae to psych,btohqsg
Oh chey? Didn't know I was old enough but sure.,btohqsg
Just like how MOB and POA are commerce subjects,btohqsg
he got same raw as me,btohqsg
but like i somehow got personal attacked in that period by him,btohqsg
WHAT KIND OF COMBI IS THAT,btohqsg
actl i wonder the percentage of ppl doing BCMKI/PCMKI  using KI as the contrasting  as opposed to those doing the KI + Lit/hist combiscause most ppl I see who take KI take with econs +lit/hist/ell,btohqsg
this would be your average nyjc combi tho,btohqsg
acjc cannot cos of the stupid maths rule,btohqsg
Since can take 5H2 last time with the 90rp system provided you take KI,btohqsg
They talk like I am an adult lmao,btohqsg
Wait is it the sgexam disc is mostly poly while here is mostly jc ppl,btohqsg
i dont go to jc so idk what these combi names are lol,btohqsg
poor rose  she wanted to take BCMh but got BMEh,btohqsg
basically right in caps R H2 subjs,btohqsg
but this mf expects you to understand everything AFTER YOU HAVE NOT STUDIED SINCE YOUR O LEVELS,btohqsg
is it h2 bio h2 math h2 econs and h1 history,btohqsg
why would you take just bio  theres no science courses that wants you if you solely take bio lol,btohqsg
but acjc didn't offer ki since 2022,btohqsg
I agree that's why im here,btohqsg
i aint joining no sg reddit dicord bruh,btohqsg
Now Acjc doesn‚Äôt even offer KI,btohqsg
cause i theorise that most ppl who take KI are those who are more well versed in humanities subjects and want to pursue stuff like law  ppe etc,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoorwhat is with the jc poly ite delineation,btohqsg
then alot of pcm bcm ppl alr dl gp and more humans essay subjs then wont take ki,btohqsg
Also which do I count under.,btohqsg
LOL too stupid to take BCMh,btohqsg
ppl come to acjc for 4 main reasons:1. ell2. rejected from vjc3. desp to find a chiobu4. wack combis,btohqsg
tbh i wanted to take KI but i realised my sch doesnt offer,btohqsg
thats not a very nice thing to say,btohqsg
Say less bro im going tmr fr,btohqsg
Number 3... u got your priorities right bro,btohqsg
no i like shuaige not chiobu,btohqsg
Should i transfer to take CMEg,btohqsg
like how do you get rejected from 3h2 1h1 science lol,btohqsg
I thought U said U love bio tf,btohqsg
though i would say tsd intake increased over the years,btohqsg
she didnt take amath and she took combined sciences,btohqsg
ya im meeting my friends in vjc,btohqsg
not taking a math and taking h2 math?,btohqsg
I LOVE VJC WHY AM I NOT IN VJC,btohqsg
WTF I CHAT HERE UNTIL 9,btohqsg
Yeah. Which is why I Wednesday dw lmao,btohqsg
can i come for no reason,btohqsg
Gg bro i been chatting since 7+,btohqsg
unless you are a fast learner,btohqsg
But legit she's a legend la,btohqsg
Wait so who legit going funorama,btohqsg
Bro I Monday Tuesday one.. Thursdays need to see how,btohqsg
I HAVE A FRIEND IN VJC HELP,btohqsg
Anyone else wants to come funorama besides the 5 of us?,btohqsg
YEAH ALL OF MY FRIENDS WENT TO VJC!!! AND VJC GOT MORE SHUAIGE,btohqsg
TOO FAR FROM MY HOUSE SO I DIDNT CHOOSE THAT,btohqsg
I got assigned to TJC for the venue when I did private candidate,btohqsg
i was rlly impressed by their open house,btohqsg
They legit all half dead one,btohqsg
All JC do a lvl wdym,btohqsg
Ikr I am all yet none of them at once,btohqsg
I forgot sji n acsi exist,btohqsg
their a level mean median rp is very good,btohqsg
i think it's the best 2nd tier jc (assuming all jcs with a cop of <6 are considered 1st tier),btohqsg
most vjc students ive worked with,btohqsg
yeah i would have went vjc if it werent for the distance,btohqsg
i literally had someone tell me,btohqsg
"""idw do this cause my maid can do this""",btohqsg
i think acjc students are worse than that yk,btohqsg
for unpacking the quality of a schools students,btohqsg
is how well they perform for a levels,btohqsg
bro i love vjc culture. im not the type that can mug 24/7 without the work hard play hard culture,btohqsg
ri/hci are definitely out of my lists because i cannot cope with the huge mugger culture,btohqsg
i think burette is the only like decent vj student,btohqsg
my vjc friends are all muggers,btohqsg
Btw guys have yall tried HDL before,btohqsg
I think the DM was saying some student threw rubbish on the floor and when confronted on why he did it  he was like ‚Äúthe cleaners are paid the pick it up‚Äù,btohqsg
they went to suntec for orientation,btohqsg
yeah that's the acjc i know,btohqsg
say their class wasnt bonded at all,btohqsg
okay maybe its just the vj people i talk to,btohqsg
they complain to me abt their school alot,btohqsg
i think the 07 batch is just more sociable  cos i heard from my friends in both arts and sci streams saying that they love their classes,btohqsg
why am i getting a complete kinda vibe from you@Randkmdkd,btohqsg
what do u mean by that,btohqsg
like all my vjc friends are super mugger type,btohqsg
when you say that they have attitude problems,btohqsg
i dont see that in my vj friends at all,btohqsg
usually there's an ip jae divide,btohqsg
we can have different vj friends,btohqsg
if you think vjc has attitude problems  you're clearly delusional,btohqsg
and hence thats why our understanding of vj people are different,btohqsg
l1r5 nett 10 and above jcs probably worse ü§£,btohqsg
vjc attitude problems what about that ri student who flushed $50 down the toilet bowl,btohqsg
Just cause one school has worse attitude problems than another school doesnt mean both schools cant both have attitude problems,btohqsg
yes we are all jae j1 kids,btohqsg
MOST poly students have superior work ethic,btohqsg
"asian parents pov:""jc = goodpoly = stupidite = failure""",btohqsg
more poly students should be getting psc scholarships,btohqsg
ye im just making a comment,btohqsg
ok it depends on which jc too,btohqsg
Not that happy abt me being in kc,btohqsg
ive had far better experiences working with poly kids than jc kids in general,btohqsg
cos my parents wld beat the shit out of me if i ever considered going to yijc,btohqsg
then i asked him what it was,btohqsg
cuz he still cant go into his uni course,btohqsg
dude they want u to be doctor at 16 ah,btohqsg
"""ite = ah lian abang school""",btohqsg
Maybe its just TP and SP,btohqsg
"""yijc is the poly of jc  while rp is the ite of poly""- parents",btohqsg
I think most unreliable is also np but the low gpas,btohqsg
i literally only know 1 non attitude problem VJ kid,btohqsg
of like the 20-30 that i interacted with,btohqsg
All the horror stories lai liao,btohqsg
The ppl I work w in sch,btohqsg
wat do u mean by complete kinda vibe,btohqsg
I only have trauma exp from,btohqsg
i mean poly kids got more project work compared to jc,btohqsg
I wrote about that for CC1,btohqsg
its not even about work ethic anymore,btohqsg
In rp its legit fk common sense,btohqsg
Idk maybe it's so bad that future students get shown my essay,btohqsg
every non poly student's view of poly,btohqsg
Bro I am all of them at once,btohqsg
imagine asking an ri student about his thoughts on rp,btohqsg
I get told I am neither tho so that's funny,btohqsg
i don't even think he knows that shit exists üíÄüíÄüò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Elitism is usually not from the top,btohqsg
Na ITE there's 1000% a stigma,btohqsg
My jc friend fine with ite ppl ah,btohqsg
nono because i have ri friends who deadass talks trash about poly ite students and double digit pointer jcs,btohqsg
Fine is one thing its more on if they treat u equally bro,btohqsg
"most of them would literally be like ""oh they exist""stop assuming that ""elite"" jc = elitistmost people just want to mind their own business",btohqsg
Can someone say this to my nightmare of a classmate this sem,btohqsg
How. Cuz any discussion about academics between both is like tryna avoid the elephant in the room,btohqsg
like sometimes the ite friends need help with sch work the poly and jc peeps will help,btohqsg
And sometimes my friend need help with jc hist ill help,btohqsg
I meant like study buddies those kind the gap is too big liao tbh and the content diffs too much,btohqsg
i ºve hung out with some of my RI friends and they actually point and laugh at lower cop jcs and ite students (when they wear their uniforms),btohqsg
. I hope I nvr bump to them xd,btohqsg
Ohya someone in my class wish the h3 maths guy,btohqsg
I couldn't study my ite topics with my JC friends lmao,btohqsg
what should i wish you get for PW,btohqsg
i mean u can ask them help with proj wat,btohqsg
poly students dont wear uniform leh  how to identify,btohqsg
that's why my ite friends do,btohqsg
ITE at least for me don't have projects one,btohqsg
yeah if that then point and laugh lor,btohqsg
i think there is some level of disconnect even if all sides are nice and non judgmental,btohqsg
this is not a RI problem,btohqsg
this is a your friends problem,btohqsg
I wore my ITE uniform to uni and they ask me if I was at the right place,btohqsg
yours is friends first then go these schs or afterwards,btohqsg
as someone in ite i have no comments  u have the super smart ppl and those who heck care bout their studies. environment wise is actly quite okay. facilities is actly nice untill some jokers decided to destroy it e.g  the toilet.,btohqsg
u are trying to have an intellectual discussion with an 07 kid,btohqsg
My CC1 topic and essay was literally on that,btohqsg
u should not have intellectual discussions with ur own batchmates,btohqsg
So my presentation I was making a point.,btohqsg
but their friends all fine also,btohqsg
Then again i feel the SAJC peeps are actually damn chill,btohqsg
U haven't seen the boys one,btohqsg
Wait till ppl here abt my case,btohqsg
i am talking bout the boys one. i saw on tiktok,btohqsg
So yeah in fact the joke for me was that should I take Nlevels to get all the seab certs.,btohqsg
Some bitch with A in the mod laugh at someone with A also,btohqsg
Blue Green Yellow all combined as one,btohqsg
Imagine a A student calling another A student undeserving of A,btohqsg
yo is anyone else coming for carnival tmr,btohqsg
to get all n level certs,btohqsg
and make noise to class and to all lecturers,btohqsg
That's the only cert I don't have,btohqsg
Maybe I take 6 Nlevels private candidate just to screw with the bellcurve,btohqsg
Na bro the actual experience is different,btohqsg
I don't dare to even bring my phone there,btohqsg
If it drops on the floor,btohqsg
dude the toilet REEKS OF 10 DAY MANIFESTED PANGSAI WITH A TOUCH OF VOMIT,btohqsg
acsi toilets were disgusting until 2024,btohqsg
I think I told this before but we could tell every April the new ITE students of they actually stopped what they where doing due to the fire alarm,btohqsg
the 10 day manifested pangsai üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg

I enter the toliet got 4 guys talking while smoking and leaning against the wall,btohqsg
It's normal lmao that's how we can tell if u veteran or not.,btohqsg

O i also walked in on 2 guys in sec sch,btohqsg
My classmates talking abt how I sit away from them for geogI'm directly in front of them,btohqsg
elitism is comprised of 50% homo and 50% racism,btohqsg
The most awkward conversation i walked into in a sch toilet is er,btohqsg
I flush the toliet.. the thing clog cuz the toliet bowl is filled with cigarette butts so I press again. This time even the intake water clog then cigarette butts came out of the fucking inlet the liquid was so brown it was like tar.,btohqsg
Like maybe I hear wrong also la,btohqsg
"dude the first thing you hear there is ""nigngigignignigni oil up in 10 minutes lil nig""",btohqsg

Ik my friend definitely did meth,btohqsg
you know bro took steroids to get straight As in promos,btohqsg
Btw my friend is in ns rn,btohqsg
i guess the reason why the telegram doesnt hate my as a 07 is because i had my canon event in 2021,btohqsg
he told his sgt he did meth and weed bef enlist,btohqsg
so i kind of learnt alot of stuff of how to deal with ppl,btohqsg
i looked through my y1y2 chats and cringed,btohqsg
the straight As aren't misinformation tho,btohqsg

I sent facebook memes in chat bruh üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
U want worse stories.So same toliet but day I enter still got cigarette butt's on the floor but this time some piss on the floor and I know this cuz the pee dried up liao and left just a yellow stain. Nevermind  I try to pee but cannot cuz even the bowl itself is burned and ashed from the cigarette burning so when I pee its like pushing away the dust.,btohqsg
u should go there and apuiapui at the school,btohqsg
i cringe at my ig stories,btohqsg

Tbh there should also be penalties for ppl who falsely accuse someone else of committing a crime,btohqsg
BRO I READ THIS AS ‚Äúso same toilet but day i enter still got butts on the floor‚Äù,btohqsg
They put the person being investigated under a lot of stress and waste the police‚Äôs resources,btohqsg

Bruh I call that toliet the cursef toliet.,btohqsg
