Yes. It is a car meet.,btohqsg
oh wow i did not know that,btohqsg
WHY THE FUCK ARE U HERE,btohqsg
https://t.me/+8Fo2MbWMHakwNjY1Wana rent modded cars? Pm to find out more or join this gc for more details!!,btohqsg
I actually did a research and there's actually m4 touring or some sort,btohqsg
err if you mean the modern BMW Z3 clownshoe concept,btohqsg
this is an actual concept  quite nice imo.,btohqsg
Bro this is just a Z4 shooting brake,btohqsg
Ya after the end of 2013 they implemented that for the m3 strictly sedan or touring,btohqsg
Have yall seen the 2024 m5 prototype?,btohqsg
the sedan isn't a looker. the touring is pretty neat.,btohqsg
though for this current generation i'd prefer the 214 Mercs,btohqsg
They made it look more like 7 series instead of 5 series.....,btohqsg
The f90 was the last decent m5 ever,btohqsg
yep don‚Äôt like the rear tails,btohqsg
but will prolly grow on me eventually,btohqsg
This is what i said for the G series M3/M4,btohqsg
the headlights are too small  rear end is abit bland...,btohqsg
Must wait for people come with bodykits,btohqsg
don't like the new 5er tbh.,btohqsg
though the 3 series is beautiful,btohqsg
This would be my ideal build once I get my hands on a f90,btohqsg
haha but i prefer the pre LCI,btohqsg
the cls in the back ü•∞ü•∞,btohqsg
this one too much forged carbon for me,btohqsg
i‚Äôd like snapper rocks blue + HRE or smth gaodim,btohqsg
I like forged carbon for some reason,btohqsg
But I do agree I also dw spend to. Much on aesthetic cuz the mods would be a killer,btohqsg

Hey guys  these past few weeks  me and some admins realized how thetoxicity in this group chat has increased exponentially. I get that SCM is not that well reputable with its moments such as photos being stolen or such  but itdoesn‚Äôt give y‚Äôall the right to harass others for their opinion.We‚Äôve hadcountless complaints on the rowdiness of this group chat  with some of thefirst few supporters of this group chat even leaving after being harassed continuouslyevery time he says something. The reason why I‚Äôve never really put my foot down on this issue is ever since the previous incident I had with this group chat  I‚Äôve never really focused on the problems here as I thought it would solve itself  but clearly that‚Äôs not the case.I get that sometimes it may be completely jokes to you guys  but I hope y‚Äôall also consider the other party‚Äôs point of view. After all  this is supposed to be a group chat for new people to come in and know more about our car scene. Yes  the new people may be annoying  or sometimes plain stupid  butus being unwelcoming or trying to gatekeep what‚Äôs left of the ‚Äúgood old times‚Äù will not avoid the inevitable moment where more ‚Äúkids‚Äù will discover the scene here.I really don‚Äôt want to micromanage  especially like what someone previously said: it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm trying to handle primary school kids. But this is my chatroom after all  so I have to maintain a standard of it  and I hope you guys can understand. As such  I‚Äôll have toimpose on the rules of this chatroom a bit more for the peace of this chatroom  lo. I hope y‚Äôall can improve a bit  don‚Äôt have to attack anyone for an opinion that‚Äôs different than what others would say.Other than that  I will alsoimprove on the admin lineupand will make sure no incidents will happen again with them related to abuse or such. But yeah  I hope y‚Äôall can cooperate too  lo. Every day got argument  how can like that‚Ä¶ Thanks a lot for reading if you did.,btohqsg
The increase in toxicity since when i first joined has been quite obvious la. I'm sure we all want this to be a welcoming and supportive environment for all of us.,btohqsg
Genuinely  lets actually make this a good place for all of us to indulge of our common love for cars,btohqsg
only thing that hand smokes is clutches,btohqsg
