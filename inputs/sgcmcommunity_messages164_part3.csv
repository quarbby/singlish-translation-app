Pi got some pi scam. Keep making excuse car is late,btohqsg
Just buy ad model. Less chance of scam.,btohqsg
NEA sets the standard  testing would be LTA. But then again if the model has already gone thru homoglation  it should be a breeze and not stucked somewhere for weeks. Utter BS imho,btohqsg
Will.update you guys on the outcome..thanks thanks,btohqsg
Coz im not sure of the procedure..so im assuming that noise test takes some time..,btohqsg
