i realised im too lazy for that,btohqsg
I too out of touch alr,btohqsg
Idk whats the new updates and reworks,btohqsg
So i dont bother playing on weekends,btohqsg
I don’t play bideo games any more,btohqsg
u can login everyday for free hextech chests,btohqsg
The only game i play is,btohqsg
i just opened 1 hextech chest,btohqsg
and it spawned another hextech chest,btohqsg
and i opened that  and it spawned another hextech chest,btohqsg
it spawned another hextech chest again!,btohqsg
i just came home from tuition,btohqsg
Its my way of not being bored,btohqsg
When the boy in blue books out,btohqsg
We’re the only 2 regular users here who booked out,btohqsg
army is the most brainless time of ur lices,btohqsg
I thought I would become a clerk,btohqsg
Actually I have no idea what my vocation does,btohqsg
I think ive got an idea,btohqsg
I’ll find out when I go to school on Monday,btohqsg
Plus im not sure how accurate it is,btohqsg
They taught us that during Basic Security Protection Measures in BMT,btohqsg
Cause we do it with section mates,btohqsg
i5 tH15 a J0kE t0 y0u,btohqsg
Imagine telling your section mate to sir stop sir,btohqsg
Ive got me1 call me sir,btohqsg
Damn army jokes are really boring,btohqsg
Damn NON-SPF jokes are really boring**,btohqsg
Shit there goes my chance to enter Fromtline vocation,btohqsg
Community engagement occifer it is then,btohqsg
What did u think we called it,btohqsg
Vocation seems like a very SAF term,btohqsg
we are also an armed force widepeeposad,btohqsg
Man the only thing im sad about is,btohqsg
Don’t they give those out at community outreach events and shit,btohqsg
The instant self heating mala is like MRE like that.,btohqsg
Idk + eating out in field vs st home is diff,btohqsg
My squadmate wanted to be song ic,btohqsg
Go NPC. Then you can memorize the routes to all the good coffeeshops in the area.,btohqsg
Uniform is old uniform de. With silver buttons,btohqsg
Shoes was still the China-version Hush Puppies. At least get the Magnum when I go NPC,btohqsg
Both my boots are magnum stealth,btohqsg
They gave me stealth and want me to bang louder,btohqsg
Get the Magnum shiok sia. Damn comfortable.And got spare pair in my NPC  the AO found in store room. Gave to me and I sell on carousell to a cisco guy. $60,btohqsg
My magnums alr gave me ingrown toenails,btohqsg
The normal one. Not the SOC Magnum,btohqsg
SOC and PCG one is high cut right?,btohqsg
Eh no idt mine is high cut,btohqsg
No  SOC and PCG one is even higher cut. NPC de Magnum like only to above ankle.SOC one is high cut like army boots,btohqsg
I think half calf is the term,btohqsg
Mine is until my shin start,btohqsg
Ya. This is the normal NPC magnum,btohqsg
My front part is solid like metal sia,btohqsg
To me it’s comfortable. But some ppl find it hard. Usually it’s because they get half size too small.,btohqsg
Ah yes i got half a size smaller,btohqsg
Emart hasnt set up yet .-.,btohqsg
If really desperate can get on carousell. $40-70,btohqsg
The NSF and NSMen a lot selling,btohqsg
Nah i using my friends pair for a while,btohqsg
Also  your wisdom teeth removed already?,btohqsg
Then get it done during NS. Free and you get 1 week MC,btohqsg
My wisdom tooth okay why need remove,btohqsg
I wan go for whitening all the sauces making my teeth discolour,btohqsg
Good chance once you boomer  will need to remove.In the army they all know to do this. But in spf and scdf  very few ppl know,btohqsg
And wisdom extraction not cheap. Can be $1 000 per tooth if it comes out wrong way. If got not enough in medisave  pay cash,btohqsg
i saw the literal receipt during NS,btohqsg
I cant imagine needing to remove wisdom tooth,btohqsg
Simple extraction is cheap. But if grow sideways  it’s that much outside. Not Poly or govt price,btohqsg
That’s what I used to think until I had mine extracted a few months ago. Growing up always wondered what is this wisdom teeth nonsense.,btohqsg
Teaching is really popular in SG,btohqsg
Compared to most of the other NTU courses,btohqsg
its an iron rice bowl career that's why,btohqsg
Amen ill ask my cm about this,btohqsg
best iron rice bowl is military,btohqsg
shake leg  command NSFs to do ur work  free money,btohqsg
Also ask your army friends. Strange how it’s common knowledge to maximize this in saf but not scdf/spf,btohqsg
But if things go bad  you have a lot of responsibility,btohqsg
i will see 90% of the regulars get replaced with NSF officers instead,btohqsg
You should be in bed son,btohqsg
You should have your eyes closed and you should be unconscious,btohqsg
There is no spf sticker pack,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionu still going AFTC there on Monday?,btohqsg
I have to reach there 0745 Monday,btohqsg
what will happen if I don’t do well for jc 2 block exams? It doesn’t matter at all right? Because I’m gonna be taking a levels anyway. I have a fear of doing very badly for my exams like UUU (maybe only for math and not the other two h2s) but yeah.... i’m just scared.,btohqsg
ofc it doesn't matter if you are aiming for edusave scholarship award  but it definitely matters as a checkpoint test to see how well you know your stuff.,btohqsg
jiayousss i'm scared for the exams too HAHA mine start tmrr,btohqsg
Join the group if u wanna jio for ball,btohqsg
I gg get all U also,btohqsg
im just aiming to pass everything,btohqsg
bruh if i pass everything i'll cry happy tears,btohqsg
and hopefully shoot for a B for maths and (maybe) chem,btohqsg
i put in so much effort,btohqsg
goodluck for le test boys n girls,btohqsg
finally sg shutting down borders tmr,btohqsg
B for maths... bruh I can't relate,btohqsg
but good luck to those j2s taking block tests tmr yaaaa,btohqsg
wait but we can still go overseas right,btohqsg
just closing our borders to short term visitors,btohqsg
hide in a random pacific island and wait out the crisis,btohqsg
and probably infect the tribes unknowingly 😩😩😩,btohqsg
no bro im considerate imma hide in a deserted island,btohqsg
u rich enough for that meh?,btohqsg
(1) your foundation isn't good yet(2) time to reevaluate ur study methods???,btohqsg
that i got covid19 when i was in china last christmas,btohqsg
School will shame and expel you,btohqsg
i got really sick really quick with flu symptoms even though i had a flu shot,btohqsg
fucks sake people who go overseas cuz airtix are cheap,btohqsg
bruh dec covid19 wasnt a thing yet,btohqsg
there's a reason why it's called Covid19,btohqsg
seriously what is personal and social responsibility,btohqsg
there was like 10 cases or sth when i was in china,btohqsg
and i took the train... no airtix,btohqsg
i know ppl who went korea thailand indonesia recently,btohqsg
personal responsibility is definitely having the rights to go whereever and whenever u want because u purchased your own air tickets w ur own moneyAnd social responsibility is definitely assuming that everyone wears a mask so everyone should be fine 🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧🤧,btohqsg
If u cant perform at block exams  u think u can perform at a lvls?,btohqsg
Because it’s the 19th title in the series,btohqsg
i got friends that had 0 rp for prelims then 65rp for a levels,btohqsg
I thought WHO said it's because it's discovered in 2019 😔😔😔 or am I so misinformed,btohqsg
pretty sure it’s the age of the virus,btohqsg
You’re young so you don’t know about covids 1 to 18,btohqsg
i think if one rlly has the drive to seek consults  consolidate  practice etc.  It's not too late to score well for As,btohqsg
come back kena 14 day shn I think,btohqsg
ye that one cfm  got quite a few friends under shn now,btohqsg
time to go for a cheap holiday,btohqsg
too bad nsfs who kena need to burn leave and extend ord date,btohqsg
Hide out in Wuhan where there are 0 local cases,btohqsg
the Lawrence Wong guy said that the govt will take measures if sporeans insist to travel overseas tho,btohqsg

we can dab on the art ppl,btohqsg
ya but I think im gonna fail lit as usual,btohqsg
timetable doesn't say any paper other than art leh,btohqsg
Do u only have one paper per day?,btohqsg
gp in the morning  physics in the afternoon,btohqsg
i have done pretty much nothing too,btohqsg
I'm just gonna study at night or smth,btohqsg
"im just ""reading articles"" on Reddit",btohqsg
cause tbh my skills lie within smoking like fuck for paper 1,btohqsg
and then paper 2 the compre just works,btohqsg
well i try to get full marks for compre cause AQ can go to hell,btohqsg
"i just hope that the qns for tmr isn't smth like oh ""national service"" just like last yr Promos",btohqsg
I don't even remember what the paper was,btohqsg
the average over the past 1 year has been 0.75,btohqsg
The paper apparently asked if national service was justified or smth idEK but it threw me off like wtf am I gg to write lets say if that's the only qn on the paper,btohqsg
yea i dont remember it lmao,btohqsg
I was lucky to get 2/10 Coz I wrote 2 paragraphs 😩,btohqsg
and here i am watching the office instead of studying for physics,btohqsg
u should continue study  after watching man,btohqsg
This is the first conversation between JC students here in months,btohqsg
Come by more often so we don’t become SGTekong,btohqsg
The reason why u can sleep in peace,btohqsg
I dont see saf being activated for nus peeping tom,btohqsg
I better see 2LT arriving on the scene of crime,btohqsg
SAF’s goal is to not be activated,btohqsg
because the 2LT is the perpetrator of the crime,btohqsg
SCDF ppl are hotties. Their basic training is gym twice a day and eat a lot of protein powder. And do bicep curls before every meal,btohqsg
spf boi also hot 🥵 🥴,btohqsg
rlly exposing myself like that huh,btohqsg
SPF is laoya ma. Only know how to find coffeeshop to eat,btohqsg
You join SPF. You will be treated like a queen,btohqsg
inb4 scdf sponsor everyone’s protein powders,btohqsg
my dad has been telling me to,btohqsg
clearly im not capable of it,btohqsg
If you go NPC become team leader  you can chope anyone you like to be your partner every shift.,btohqsg
Any1 know avg price of safety shoes,btohqsg
Some team leader so queen and king they don’t even need to ask someone to help them buy food. Ppl will automatically buy for them,btohqsg
Varies a lot. Can be anywhere from $30-200,btohqsg
But $30 ones very uncomfortable. Your toes and feet will hate you,btohqsg
Wah this one 40 dollar worth anot,btohqsg
tf go buy one phua chu kang boots and cut it,btohqsg
It’s normal price but honestly  it’s not comfortable. If you just need to wear a few times then go for it. If you need to wear for long hours  I recommend you go to the shop to try. Peninsula basement got a lot.,btohqsg
Then I think ok la. You ordering online?,btohqsg
Wah lazy go peninsula sia haha,btohqsg
$40 is normal price for that. So is ok,btohqsg
Yah because you’re the boss of your team of about 14-18 policemen/women. Your TL posting will come usually a year after you finish training at HTA. After HTA  you will be investigation officer first,btohqsg
So common to see a queen TL age 26-27,btohqsg
urgh all the police terms @.@,btohqsg
TL = team leader. HTA = training place,btohqsg
Yah. GRF is in NPC. The chief of each GRF shift is the Team Leader.NPC also got the Community Policing Unit. The ones that wear white polo shirt and shorts. And cycle around.,btohqsg
Training ok la. SPF training after all. Not army. Plus once you sign  you will be Inspector. While your trainers mostly will be lower rank than you. So won’t get tekan so much,btohqsg
Need degree for direct entry inspector.,btohqsg
Literally any degree in SG recognized uni can,btohqsg
direct entry inspector is the sign on immediately become inspector la right,btohqsg
Yah. The moment you enter training  they already give you the rank to wear on your shoulder,btohqsg
kek i used to think i wanted to be an investigator forensics and all until i realised i hate sciences,btohqsg
That’s for the “recognized” uni like NUS  NTU  SUSS  etc,btohqsg
my dad say first few ranks not much moolah one,btohqsg
SG forensics is BOOOOORING. Country is safe. So very few cases. Which is good,btohqsg
But you will get to go for a shitload of training. Overseas training,btohqsg
im so confuzzled by the number,btohqsg
You would have to make your way to the air base,btohqsg
Which is an undesirable journey to undertake,btohqsg
I could cycle straight through it,btohqsg
Jsnt that like spf or army boots,btohqsg
I’m standing in front of the mrt door,btohqsg
I am standing behind the mrt door,btohqsg
U look in the mirror ull see me,btohqsg

what is ippt? Can eat one?,btohqsg
I’m the last to enlist I think,btohqsg
I am the last to enlist,btohqsg
nervousness is part of the package,btohqsg
Never a better time to enlist than amidst a viral outbreak,btohqsg
The only social distancing you will do is half left,btohqsg
I think I’m on the same bus as the sergeant in charge of us this week,btohqsg

For my group we kinda were,btohqsg
Dun worry mine was an unofficial brief,btohqsg
Umm safety is like for everyone tho,btohqsg
So probably all have to take,btohqsg
