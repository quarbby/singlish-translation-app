Hi. Any issue with lala app?App keep closing.,btohqsg
Walao eh accept order nearer to the destination than the pick-up,btohqsg
Lalamove ballot system should include distance from pickup as a factor too,btohqsg
As long as within 30 mins the driver goes to you  why would you bother? You expect within 5 mins the driver comes to you?,btohqsg
Nearby what. Under 10mins can reach. What‚Äôs wrong with that? Once order accepted we drivers have 30mins to reach pick up point if it‚Äôs ‚Äúpick up now‚Äù.. if u wanna complain then send urself lah don‚Äôt need to use llm do for u.,btohqsg
Problem not the driver  it's Lalamove,btohqsg
Just now I saw using my driver app 3 people ballot  they should prioritize those who are nearer to the pickup,btohqsg
It does prioritise those who are nearer to get the job  however those drivers who are near may not want to take your job  you see.,btohqsg
3 people ballot  the one who is nearest to the pickup location will get the job.,btohqsg
