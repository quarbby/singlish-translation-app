Chris' thumbnail game never fail to deliver.,btohqsg
just started working at 28/29wanting to supercharged but can only put in 8k for cpf relief üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
im still in the fence for wanting to get my own flat as single but i am tempted to bring all my OA to SA first . So  until i am ready to get a flat then   do i just leave it or dont even bring the OA to SA to the first place ü§î,btohqsg
Sigh...  with yr level of knowledge. CPF OA out perform u. What about those of us with lesser knowledge  how r we to stand a chance. Maybe  I can only retire at 75 or retire when physically unfit to work further.,btohqsg
work till no hands and or leg haha,btohqsg
I thought OA to SA is one way ticket? U can‚Äôt use SA to buy flat  right?,btohqsg
One way ticket henceeither i sacrifice the 1.5% compound annually just so have enough OA funds to pay for hdb downpayment (miss the amount long term but can have tax relief long run)or just whack OA into SA and use cash on hand to pay (this will lower the RSTU i think ),btohqsg
if you are good in investment  you cash in hand can generate return higher than higher 5% per year. Then use OA to down payment is better.,btohqsg
MoneyOwl shows 15% time weighted return   outperform cpfoa few times leh,btohqsg
i dont think i have good intutions as well. currently cash on hand in ocbc 360 so since less than 75k  get 3.65%pa,btohqsg
but it depends on the timing as well. if put into when its at its lowest then definitely weighted return is very high,btohqsg
Just some comments  i think perhaps you should mention a few more times in your video that you should aim to invest for the long term when you invest in a 100% equities portfolio  i only heard you mention this at the very end of the video.It‚Äôs a bit sad because people may be deterred from investing in equities in fear that they may have sub optimal returns because of your very short term results of 2 years.,btohqsg

Use uob amex to top up grab wallet. Hawker stalls do not accept CC or paywave but accept QR code with grabpay. So rather than paying cash  i scan the QR code to pay  at least got 0.3% cashback,btohqsg
Hi  anybody know if OG people‚Äôs park accept Kris+?,btohqsg
Dont think so. It‚Äôs only specific merchants,btohqsg
Use Xnap + ApplePay or Gpay to earn rewards at Hawker.,btohqsg
Does it mean i use xnap with gpay and the rewards will be as per what the card is offerring? I.e hsbc advance in gpay of 1.5% cashback,btohqsg
Hawker food typically use the same MCC as fast food. So just use the card with the highest rewards for Fastfood.,btohqsg
Usually merchants that offer Kris+ will display a small poster at the counter...,btohqsg
Yea that‚Äôs true but I didn‚Äôt wanna go all the way to find out. Wanna buy honey from honey world but seems that only their standalone stores accept Kris+  not the one at OG,btohqsg
can always do a search for Kris+ partners,btohqsg
