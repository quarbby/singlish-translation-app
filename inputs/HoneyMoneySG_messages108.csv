Wah means every day you eat macdonald... not very healthy. .. sorry to say that,btohqsg
McDonald use UOB One card.. 10% cash rebate,btohqsg
Last time. But yeah  macdonalds very unhealthy indeed. ü•≤,btohqsg
It should be fire insurance of my property. But I don't have such number,btohqsg
I've cracked the code. It's either one. So the password is only my NRIC.Thanks Jen,btohqsg
Sfye cash guarantee gives higher returns for higher risk. FD will never able to match those based on the fact FD risk is lower.,btohqsg
Hi all shifus  I have a question regarding UOB earmarkIf my March MAB is $100 000And I deposit fresh fund of $100 000 now total in bank account $200 000I choose to earmark $100 000After earmarked  I assume my account will left with $100 000 as the other 100k will be earmarked.Now  can I withdraw anything from the non earmarked $100 000 and leave with say just $50k in there? Will it forfeit the earmark or any impact?Thanks a lot in advance for the reply and advice,btohqsg
Actually Syfe cash guarantee put into FD of local banks right?,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the risk of syfe cash guarantee,btohqsg
Based on this it seems that the only difference is SDIC insured?Cause they did mention syfe capital and interest is guaranteed subject to underlying bank risk. So same idea as FD with banks?https://help.syfe.com/hc/en-us/articles/21956535616793-What-s-the-difference-between-Cash-Guaranteed-fixed-deposit-account-and-SSB,btohqsg
Hi to those who are Citi PremierMiles credit card holder  is there a monthly minimum spend required? Thanks in advance :),btohqsg
Thanks! Just the annual fee of $196.20 right?,btohqsg
Yes they still deposit into FD,btohqsg
So better put $$ In cash + guarantee than FD ?,btohqsg
Cannot touch the entire $200k based on tnc. Hence u get lousy interest on $200k. Thus not worth doing.,btohqsg
Usually I use citi premier miles card to book agoda. Just a bit more expensive,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have syfe but rate seems better now current FD now. Unless u work for bank and have corporate FD,btohqsg
Better diversify.. not worth put all at syfe,btohqsg
They also not putting in syfe what you talking,btohqsg
It‚Äôs about the same  current rate is around 3.75 and 3.7,btohqsg
Oh the whole 200k ah... OK then not worth it... thought can use the remaining 100k not earmarked,btohqsg
Pls answer to people who ask not me,btohqsg
Hahaha they answering to different topic at all,btohqsg
Oh i mean banksi see banks now 3 months better than 6 to 12 months. They worry fed drop rates.,btohqsg
Then you can look into tbills  FD usually don‚Äôt have good rates,btohqsg
If you can accept the higher risk and the your investment in syfe is not sdic guaranteed. On Sfye page  they also stated it is not the same as FD.,btohqsg
Do you put in tbills too? Usually you choose com or non com,btohqsg
I only do CPF t bills and I always put comp 2.98%.,btohqsg
Last week was on the way  this week got bus stop,btohqsg
If put comp  and the yield after auction turns out to be higher  you‚Äôll get the higher yield? I always do non comp but I see alot choosing comp instead,btohqsg
YesNon comp scared no full allocation,btohqsg
Maybe the two of them meeting,btohqsg
Ohhh so technically no impact in choosing comp.,btohqsg
U do affect the cutoff yield very slightly if u lowball.,btohqsg
I waiting for him to come over ma  need live location,btohqsg
Hi gurus  only recently I know about this moomoo 6.8% promo. May I seek your advice which cash fund is better for 60 days subscription. Thank you!,btohqsg
And does it make sense to pull out $ from OCBC 360 and UOB one account for this promo assuming I have $200k cash?,btohqsg
Talked about this in my last cash videohttps://youtu.be/hiQbB3k8rk8,btohqsg
What is the best method to pay income tax?,btohqsg
"Chris did a video ""I Found the BEST Ways to Pay Income Tax in 2024"" go watch it",btohqsg
Worth it to use UOB krisflyer + amaze(if no online payment option) for local shopping for large ticket item 5-6k and pay the 1% fee or just use a general spend card like dbs vantage.,btohqsg
Here is my plan for tax payment  anything incorrect?- I have not received NOA from IRAS for YA2023  but already have the monthly giro plan from IRAS  which will deduct on 6th monthly- I plan to use cardup for 1.75% with uob prvi visa  1st transaction will get $30 rebate offQuestion  can I do this month by month in cardup  or must be recurring ? What date I should ask cardup to pay? Like on 25th a month before?,btohqsg
Assume 6k purchase  you are paying 6050sgd for 18k miles by UOB + amaze or 6000sgd for 9k miles by dbs vantage. This works out 0.55 cpm (50sgd for 9k miles)  which is worth using UOB kf imo. Ofc  u need to consider this 6k spend can contribute towards vantage 60k spend for annual fee waiver.,btohqsg
Hi Guys and ladies. Morning.I just read through hsbc revolution card terms and conditions.It didn't state that Xnap pair with Google with this card. You won't earn bonus point . Pls assist me. To advise.,btohqsg
Both ways possible  utitlise the first payment with referral code first  then subsequently cardup codes,btohqsg
XNAP Mcc is 5814. 5814 is excluded for HSBC Revolution,btohqsg
Thanks chris.So I believe using Xnap to eat at hawker and coffee food should still be fine.. if not have to use amex pay as the last option,btohqsg
Some people can use. Some can't,btohqsg
I saw at nearby coffee shop eat.,btohqsg
1 lady can use .. when I can't use last month,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt Chris say it‚Äôs excluded? What do you mean by it‚Äôs still fine?,btohqsg
Impossible  the app is not even available,btohqsg
I mean he says excluded is for macdonald and other fast food  also jolibee. I say fine means can be use for hawkers.,btohqsg
You mean you delete xnap apps from your phone ?,btohqsg
‚ÄúXNAP mcc is 5814‚Äù which is excluded,btohqsg
5814 is for fast food .. right bro. ?,btohqsg
When you scan xnap QR code  it gives you internal server error. So the lady is probably not even using xnap,btohqsg
I read at sethisfy. It says 5814 is nerfy   also mention fast food,btohqsg
Wah like that better use uob preferred visa to eat at ya kun better..  spend a bit more,btohqsg
Fast food is not literally fast food like your mcd or what. It depends on the mcc code ‚ÄúXNAP transactions code asMCC 5814 Fast Food Restaurants‚Äù,btohqsg
This term really confusing... thanks bro for pointing out...,btohqsg
Sam. So means even xnap can be used. If pair with hsbc revolution.  Eat at hawker. You won't get 4 miles ?,btohqsg
How is it confusing? HSBC revo goes by mcc whitelist  just based it on the mcc  doesn‚Äôt matter what you eat. Learn how to read  even Chris say it‚Äôs excluded,btohqsg
lol which part of excluded you don‚Äôt understand,btohqsg
Because I thought mcc 5814 is for fast food,btohqsg
Yes. It matters. Because if 5814 is only for fast food. Xnap if is still OK. Can still be use to earn 4 miles,btohqsg
Worse to worse. Use another option. Amex pay.,btohqsg
The conclusion is:- You can't use XNAP right now (so don't even talk about HSBC Revolution here)  and- HSBC Revolution doesnt award 4mpd on Fast Food MCC 5814,btohqsg
You may want to understand what is mcc code first n also understand which merchants are under 5814.MCD  yakun  Aston  Ajisen Ramen  Kopitiam  KFC  Xnap  Starbucks‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ are all using mcc code 5814 for its credit card transactions.,btohqsg
Use UOB Evol CC to renew road tax  qualifies the $250 online purchase?,btohqsg
Nerf q...been using uob lady cc to pay recurring insurance premium to hit 500 spend. As it is gg to end and wonder how i can use the card to hit 500 spend instead .,btohqsg
Just use as normal for other expenses? What category did you select for lady?,btohqsg
is XNAP app gone for good?,btohqsg
oh no  is there a nerf for this,btohqsg
Is it advisable to use Citi rewards card pair with Amaze card to book SQ tickets to Japan?The Citi rewards point likely won‚Äôt apply for air tickets but do it get the instapoints and the good fx rate?,btohqsg
Only uob one card/debit take recurring insurance as spending for uob one acct. Does uob lady count as well?,btohqsg
Tks all for my q. I've nvr use this card b4 for other exps. Tried once last mth for mrt topup but seemed like not added to my 500 spend. Wonder for food or groceries count. As m not working so not much i could spend for 500.,btohqsg
the nerf u are saying is using insurance premium as 500 spending for uob one account?,btohqsg
Just happen to open uob one when i wanted to do a fd back then. Was then told i could earn higher int rate for it making 500spend + salary or 3 giro.,btohqsg
What do you mean by going to end?,btohqsg
My premium for insurance gg to end soon so no more 500spend,btohqsg
Instapoints only for foreign transactions. You booking your flights in sgd?,btohqsg
Cos the premium will end soon n if no spend 500 i wont be able to earn good interest for amt in uob1 acct,btohqsg
That‚Äôs not the definition of nerf.,btohqsg
Oh...i thot nerf means silly q...sorry yah,btohqsg
Depends on your spending anyways  you can pay for your family members insurance through your card and have them pay you. Or buy supermarket vouchers to make up the shortfall,btohqsg
On SQ website it‚Äôs allowed to select payment by jpn yen or sgd.Their sgd rate sux so I figure better use amaze card to pay by jpn yen.,btohqsg
You are better off using another general spend master card + Amaze  at least still can get 1.x mpd.,btohqsg
Imo  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth just to get the instapoints only since Citi rewards exclude airlines related. And you have to calculate the fx spread of using amaze to see if it‚Äôs actually cheaper than paying in sgd directly,btohqsg
Hi all Anyone use any miles card to pay for petrol?,btohqsg
Cuz I only have one master card haha.,btohqsg
is there any way to check my citi rewards points expiry instead of calling the cust support?,btohqsg
what category is chosen for ur uob lady? If not sure can contact uob to enquire.,btohqsg

Hi All I hv participated the Big Saving Promo in April 2024 with 50k and now pending Earmarked by end of this May.There was an original 100k earmarked and has just released few days ago.Can I transfer out this original 100k after the 50k is being earmarked?Thanks.,btohqsg
You mention that there is a better method but not mentioned in the video,btohqsg
He alrd say cannot share it publicly,btohqsg
Is it shared in the telegram community?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  happy Sunday. Would anyone know if the Citi SMRT card is able to earn 5% on Kris+?,btohqsg
Why not you search or don‚Äôt expect every tricks and tips to be given. More people know the faster it gets nerf,btohqsg
I realise you need to spend 1k per month to get 4 miles . Uob signature visa.. force to spend 1k every month,btohqsg
Actually I feel revolution is becoming not so great anymore. Hope it won't remove bonus spend for air ticket.,btohqsg
What are you even talking about? First say uob now say hsbc,btohqsg
"Oh my bad I never knew that there was such a dumb T&C... just went to read and it states ""You are required to maintain the applicable minimum Incremental Fresh Fund (i.e. the aggregate of yourAccount‚Äôs Monthly Average Balance for March 2024 and the Participating Deposit amount) for the fullEarmark Period.""So answer is no  cannot withdraw",btohqsg
Because previously before covid time some cash back card need to hit certain minimum sum to enjoy the higher % of cashback... uob also seem to be the case too.,btohqsg
This is one of the eg.Need to spend 2k to enjoy 2.5% cash back,btohqsg
Xnap is unusable anymore may I know if there is any other app we can use?,btohqsg
But these 2 hawker and coffee shop not available..,btohqsg
Sadly other than that  couldn‚Äôt think of any. Maybe AMEX Pay?,btohqsg
I also feel so. Last option Amex pay to earn the miles,btohqsg
Shopback pay is available in some hawker and coffee shops. And Amex pay requires you to have an Amex card,btohqsg
Bro. Not really. I live sengkang here don't have shopback pay.. it depends where you live. Usually old estates won't have . Eg ang mo kio and toa payoh   red hill sides hdb blocks,btohqsg
But your phrase was hawker and coffee shop not available. But it is. It depends on the stall not the estate,btohqsg
hi has anyone received the monthly SMS confirmation for HSBC EGA bonus yet?,btohqsg
Not sure if this DCS card can be used in hawker and coffeeshop sgqr. Has anyone tried so far ?,btohqsg
Hi   does anyone participated in Webull Transfer-in promotion in Feb ? Are we supposed to receive the first tranche of  TSLA fractional shares 90 days after successfully transferred or is it 90 days after the end day of the promotion? I can't locate T&C anymore.,btohqsg
Only if there's the UnionPay logo,btohqsg
Seems like DCS Mastercard cannot be used on Diners SG Pay,btohqsg
It mentioned DCS Cards App not Diners SG Pay. For the DCS ultimate platinum UnionPay card. 2% cashback with no minimum spend.,btohqsg
"Yes. Diners works with ""Diners Club International"" logo. Used Cashback card for 5% with $400 min spend.",btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know which month I participated  either Jan or Feb. I submitted form in end of Jan.Did you withdraw any of your Webull cash fund to your bank account?,btohqsg

Hi  anyone know if buying electrical appliances via shopback using Citi rewards still entitled to 4mpd ? I notice on heymax it indicated except appliances ü§î,btohqsg
you use UOB VS only if you're certain you'll spend more than 1k in a month...if you have to force the spend you might as well use another card,btohqsg
Nope I did not make any withdrawal  may I know when did u received this? Reward?,btohqsg
as long as the MCC isn't blacklisted by CRMC (travel MCCs and other standard exclusions) you'll be entitled to 4mpd  description text is just a guideline,btohqsg
hi anyone doing the deposit 10k into uob ladys account to get 6mpd on uob ladys card?can i check... how to determine which transactions will qualify to get the extra 2mpd? is it only transactions AFTER the ladys account opening has been approved?say i open an account tmrw  only transactions from tmrw onwards will qualify for the extra 2mpd?,btohqsg

Hi Gurus  I understand that Amaze card convert all transaction to online transaction. In this case  what is the MCC code it convert to?,btohqsg
Hmm‚Ä¶ in this case why do people use it to convert to online transactions?,btohqsg
I suggest you spend some time reading on benefits/use cases of amaze and come back with questions.,btohqsg
In this case  I guess that‚Äôs work for the uob evol as well  where there is a 20 dollars cap for mobile contactless and online spend,btohqsg
Certain cards only awards miles to online transactions. Eg. CRMC. UOB KF shopping.,btohqsg
Amaze can only be linked to master card  not for Visa.,btohqsg
Evol is a visa. Do some fact check or research first,btohqsg
Oh ya.. I missed out on that,btohqsg
Guys and ladies. Do you think ocbc rewards card . 6 miles earn now will extend beyond 30 june,btohqsg
Actually uob ladies card 6 miles earn should have ended by now. If not for they open up on the guys can open ladies account for extended 2 miles earn.,btohqsg
Pls go read ocbc page  the 6 miles changes merchant every quarter.,btohqsg
They should follow the original mcc but they might have some random mcc,btohqsg
Dk what you‚Äôre trying to say,btohqsg
Think he's referring to the put 10k in savings account for uob ladies to get 6mpd offer,btohqsg
Guys can already open ladies savings account,btohqsg
Just read it.. it says that july to sept the ocbc rewards card category earn on 6 miles change again,btohqsg

hihie  may i check if the $800 include the Cardup MCC 7399 transactions for signing up for the SC smart card?,btohqsg

b cself promos can be done in@HoneyCombSGgroup instead.. not sure if it still allows new chats ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
It depends on what shopback code the mcc as,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check whether the following is true:I'm trying to buy some tickets to an event and the website allows me to either pay in USD or SGD.Question: if I were to select to pay in USD and my payment method is a MasterCard linked with Amaze  would it be categorised as a foreign spend? No chance it will be domestic right? Trying to avoid the $1k domestic no fee for Amaze while also earning Instapoints.,btohqsg

anyone knows for the uob one quarterly bonus cashback  is paying of road tax counted?,btohqsg
excludedRoad Tax best paid with Paypal +UOB AbsoluteAmex TrueCashback,btohqsg
A simple search on the uob one main page will give you the answer,btohqsg
For wedding wise  it depends on whether the hotel code their mcc as hotel or restaurant. But most cards have a cap of 1k spend.,btohqsg
Did anyone see this transactions before in their credit card?,btohqsg
Hi  is XNAP still in service? It‚Äôs always showing error for me.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGtyvm for introducing ZIM e-sim in ur latest video! just to check your review vs Simba - is the connection more reliable? i was told Simba is pretty inconsistent‚Ä¶ üòÖ,btohqsg
Coming from an ex-Simba user  it is a big upgrade in connectivity,btohqsg
simba kind of hit or miss for some people  i was having good and consistent network   but my friends complain of bad and inconsistent network,btohqsg
cavaet is that i switched since Jul 2023  so im not sure how far simba has improved,btohqsg
my simba speed test consistently 20-30mbps only..lol,btohqsg
is ZYM esim? don't recall them having esim option,btohqsg
yes i just downloaded the app and it‚Äôs mentioned there,btohqsg
depends from person to person   20-30mbps is fine for my use case  i just watch videos and browse internet  which load quick enough ( dont really see any buffer time compared to m1 when underground)   better signal than m1 sometimes even,btohqsg
my 1st year of simba... underground coverage was 0..haha,btohqsg
Anyone know what kind of transaction is this?,btohqsg
topping up shopee pay? or withdrawing from shopee pay?,btohqsg
Ohh then could be withdrawal. Thanks. It took so long I forgot about it,btohqsg
i used it when it was tpg in 2020 it was bad underground  but last year april - august 2023 was okay with me when going underground and even in between some areas like botanic gardens  where even M1 doesn't have receptions but my simba will be able to load,btohqsg
oh dear..M1 that bad? was thinking port my other starhub over....hear shitty reviews of starhub new star plans...haiz,btohqsg
Yup it‚Äôs withdrawal from my shopee pay. I just checked the amt against my shopee app,btohqsg
cool..i gonna withdraw my shopee pay amount too,btohqsg
M1 has always been bad. You‚Äôre better off with StarHub or SingTel network,btohqsg
think i stay starhub 4G then...,btohqsg
nah m1 is bad . i wouldn't choose m1 even though i am still using it,btohqsg
broadband wise for all telco is the same   because they are connecting via the same cable underground,btohqsg
Yeaa broadband not much impact but mobile network depends on the cell towers,btohqsg
mine home M1 fiber for 8 years...so far so good,btohqsg

Hi Guys and ladies. I tried last night to transfer ocbc $ points at stack webpage of ocbc to marriot bonvy points..But can't find it to transfer. Pls advise.,btohqsg
oh nuts.. thanks... i totally forgot UOB Absolute started their nonsense exclusions already.. Will amend my post,btohqsg
I tried at ocbc stack page... only can transfer to kris flyer SQ and also cash. Can't transfer to marriot bonvy,btohqsg
I say ocbc reward redemption website not stack  explore that,btohqsg
I've looked at the app  not sure how this is done. Could u pls share more info?,btohqsg
one motoring website.. when u pay.. can choose paypaljust pay as GUEST.. then key in your amex truecashback,btohqsg
Any suggestion for upcoming 6 Months T bills cutoff yield for competitive bid? Thanks,btohqsg
hmm.. firstly cash i won't do Tbills since banks savings rate are high..so if you really want to do tbills you should put a comp bid something high like 3.58% (but risk not getting any allocation),btohqsg
I see. Appreciate it. Does PayPal work with any other bills like IRAS?,btohqsg
Iras doesn't accept paypal from what i know,btohqsg
Can anyone have experience if ufit is 7997 and good to use HSBC Revolution? here is the result from heymax,btohqsg
it depends on your opportunity cost right,btohqsg
if you don't get the T bills what interest will the money earns?,btohqsg
so for example if you don't get the tbills you will put the cash into an instrument that earns 2.0%  then anything higher than 2% will be better.,btohqsg
which is why CPF tbills i always put comp below 3%.. but people scold me low ball.. LOL,btohqsg
haha I am the selfish one I only care about myself. if it brings down the yeild so be it.,btohqsg
i seriously doubt our CPF Tbill amount will move the dial..it is the FIs that really move the dial,btohqsg
else if you put 3.5% and the outcome is 3.5% you might not get full allocation.,btohqsg
Guys. I just found the answer through AI Facebook. Since Google can't find. Don't mind share with you guys and ladies. In case you want to transfer ocbc points to hotel programmes.,btohqsg
No. Is different. This one is go into ocbc online banking.,btohqsg
If you think it's fraudulent then report,btohqsg
U read what i wrote  go ocbc website which is the online banking reward,btohqsg
He cannot read. Don't waste your breath (thumb),btohqsg
Imo  it depends on what‚Äôs the acceptable rate you are ok to get  and are you willing to not get full allocation. Last few records are around 3.6-3.7  but this kind of rates easily can get outside unless you have alrd max out everything. However on a low amount of investment  3.7 is still considered high,btohqsg
One is not said by meta AI ü§°,btohqsg
Hahaha so he rather trust a robot. I guess this is the world we live in right now,btohqsg
Alright . I will try later..  thanks,btohqsg
Bros .. I would like to ask you guys .. if I cancel uob preferred visa.. the ophan points .. what you going to do about it since not all the points can be transfer to SQ kris flyer,btohqsg
Spend more to hit next block  or give up on them,btohqsg
Because last week I also realise now uob points is unable to transfer to kris pay apps anymore,btohqsg
Only 2 banks are available for such transfer.Citi bank and Dbs,btohqsg
Didn't u post a link on points transfer partners?,btohqsg
I can't find under transfer in kris pay anymore,btohqsg
Why not just convert UNI$ to KF miles then top-up to KrisPay if needed?,btohqsg
I mean the ophan points will still be there after transferring the points to kris flyer SQ,btohqsg
He probably wants to save on transfer fees (note that there is a haircut amount if transferring direct to KrisPay),btohqsg
15% haircut not worth also ü§™,btohqsg
Bro Joseph. Already canr transfer direct to kris pay..,btohqsg
Every uob 5000 UNI = 10k miles.If I have 25k uni. Then remaining 5k unable to transfer to kris pay and also kris flyer account.,btohqsg
5000 UNI = 10k miles. So why the remaining 5k cannot transfer?,btohqsg
Sorry bro. Typing error. 24k.Remaining 4k can't transfer,btohqsg
Then you spend more to make up that 1k uni$ loh. What‚Äôs hard to understand,btohqsg
Hi - I had recently wired 3 cash transactions to my interactive brokers account. Two went through and one didn‚Äôt. Now it‚Äôs been over one week and the funds are still missing from my account. I‚Äôve messaged them and tried to escalate via their portal. Has anyone had a similar issue with IBKR?,btohqsg
View that it is 67k for apr mab. Can get bonus interest in jun if already topup to 150k at end Apr?,btohqsg
are they all from the same place / same method?,btohqsg
which account are you talking about?,btohqsg
Make up 1k UNI$ will end up another 4k UNI$ left..,btohqsg
UOB One pays interest based on actual MAB.. doesn't matter what your previous month MAB is,btohqsg
If top up to 150 in end apr  your may mab should be 150k if there‚Äôs no other transactions. So you will get the full 4% in the payout in June,btohqsg
Oh ok. Becos cannot view current mab. Or can the current mab be view at uob app?,btohqsg
Why need to view if you don‚Äôt have any transactions?,btohqsg
To ensure that the mab is 150k,btohqsg
if 30th apr you have $150k.you didn't touch anything in May 2024.I guarantee you that your May 2024 MAB will be at least $150k.,btohqsg
Exactly  if you alrd have 150k in end apr. Why wouldn‚Äôt your may mab be 150k?,btohqsg
Hello  can check how long do I have to stay with giga before I can port to zym?,btohqsg
Have u checked with the bank?,btohqsg
i just port over from singtel due to the high fees compared to other MVNO.. but zym mobile dont allow direct port over from singtel.. heard there is usually 1-2 month period before can port out again. so wanna confirm on it,btohqsg
and to be clear..it was sent from your OWN account into your OWN interactive brokers?names must match fully,btohqsg
Oh ok  so there is no way to view current mab?,btohqsg
Yes I made two previous transactions which went through via DBS,btohqsg
don't think any bank has this..those of us who want such details  use our own Excel,btohqsg
Then I made a third same method. DBS confirmed it went through I have my bank statement to prove it - but funds still not reflected,btohqsg
then you should provide the refernce number of the 3rd transaction to Interactive Broker for them to urgently follow up,btohqsg
Wanted to check if anyone has had this experience,btohqsg
Yes I have. But their contact system is not very helpful,btohqsg
how they calculate MAB when not end of month yet??,btohqsg
you can still view the current mab,btohqsg
Oh ok  so can only view may mab during first of jun?,btohqsg
never heard of the 1-2 month period,btohqsg
number porting can only be done once every 3 months,btohqsg

Confirm that from 30 Apr till now  your total amount never drop below Mar MAB + participating funds?,btohqsg
If I don't do any Giro. How many % can I get?,btohqsg
If you just got earmarked  need to leave Mar MAB + participating funds still. Any excess like interest or cash credit can transfer.,btohqsg
LIf u earmarked 50k and u intend to get max 4 percent interest just leave 100k of withdrawable amt inside can Liao ‚Ä¶ the rest can just draw out all,btohqsg
3.x% + 1% on incremental MAB,btohqsg
Not what the t&c says  but up to those who are brave to try. ü§™,btohqsg
So the earmarked bonus can transfer out and not affecting the mab?,btohqsg
haiyah.. all this Just in Time and Just Enough Masters....then later come and ask why this and that,btohqsg
Then they will complain appeal to CSO fail.,btohqsg
U can request back to acct if excess credit is due to refund etc,btohqsg
It was due to the cashback received üòÖ,btohqsg
What about not affecting the MAB.. ü§™,btohqsg
MAB for this mth will be 150k ma,btohqsg
Whether transfer out of the $50 cash reward will affect the MAB or not loh,btohqsg
U earmarked 50k and u have 100k withdraw able amt the rest can draw out all,btohqsg
Hahaha if the cash reward there for 1 week  already affect MAB liao ma.. ü§°,btohqsg
For existing Accounts  the Incremental Fresh Funds must result in at least a corresponding increment in the Account‚Äôs day-end balance throughout the Promotion Period and Earmark Period as compared to the Account‚Äôs Monthly Average Balance for March 2024.,btohqsg

All along mine is 100k and now I earmarked 50 &,btohqsg
The earmarked bonus credited today must transfer out today so as not to affect mab?,btohqsg
wow nice... i never heard of anyone able to get exactly $100 000 March Monthly Average balance,btohqsg
So I add another $10 ?,btohqsg
Not everyone is. But I guess you also accounted for the base interest deposited üëçüèªüëçüèª,btohqsg
can hack into UOB system and take out the $4 so it doesn't get posted on 31st March,btohqsg
So to keep it safe I add another 1k in for this mth ????,btohqsg
refer to your March Monthly Average Balance... then add the earmark amount  and add $10 pleaseyou can see the March MAB figure in UOB App.. just follow that,btohqsg

Hi all experts out thereI took part in Uob saving promo on April for fresh funds of $20k.This $20k has been earmarked today and I have also received the cash credit of $80.My MAB for March is $50K. My question is do I need to maintain this $50k all the way to Aug? üôèüèª,btohqsg
haha it is ok.. i don't want to be JUST IN TIME or JUST ENOUGH mistress..i always like to add $1 or $10 kind of thing,btohqsg
Be careful not to trust everything the RM say,btohqsg
checking if anyone knows  if i using CPFIA OA to buy Tbill. why it does return back to my OA after mature?,btohqsg
you will need to maintain End March's MAB figure + $20 000 + ideally a buffer of $10. Refer to UOB App for your exact End March MAB figure (shared screenshot above),btohqsg
Can always withdraw out 2 or 4 to accommodate the base interest if it non working day lol,btohqsg
Thank you for your wise advice.,btohqsg
You all ah can become actor/ actress liao,btohqsg
sorry really don't understand.. what u mean 2 or 4because the $4.xx comes in on 1st of the month backdated to 31st of last month.. how u take out,btohqsg
Because just last month the uob RM want to push fixed income fund ..,btohqsg
U know it always credit last day mah if non working day  u count backward,btohqsg
Should I go for fixed income funds?,btohqsg
but you dunno the amount right? later off by 1 cent how?,btohqsg
0.05 base interest  so can still count de roughly,btohqsg
hmmm.. ok i sort of get it.. haha thanks thanks..but i kiasi pattern one.. prefer to have $10 buffer...,btohqsg

Oh man.. using an iPhone now,btohqsg
what‚Äôs the next best card to double dip on the miles?,btohqsg
Uob preferred platinum visa... . Not that good.. unless you spend 5 and above,btohqsg
I considering what bro chris has say. In the long run. Uob kris flyer card is better than uob preferred visa...,btohqsg
Hi guys  I just signed up cc for the rewards. I need to make a spend of $500 but im currently $200 short  does it counts if I buy vouchers to cover the remainder?,btohqsg

I see im paying to DBS card,btohqsg
We want to know your wise advice,btohqsg
how to see the MAB in UOB App?,btohqsg
You say uob ppv not good ma  so I wish to know why.,btohqsg
Can scroll up cannot scroll down?https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/199751,btohqsg
My opinion is stick by 4 miles cards which is a must.1. Citi rewards card.2. Hsbc revolution.I won't go for uob signature visa.You are force to spend 1k a month .. which will make your cash flow tight... is a no no,btohqsg
U got to spend what u got to spend  just because it dont suit u doesnt mean it dont suit other,btohqsg
My principal is never force yourself to spend certain amount to achieve your desire miles earn or cash back.. once you break that rule. That's how credit card debts will come in,btohqsg
Think about it why hsbc  citi rewards limit bonus spend up to 1k to 1100. Dbs woman drop 2000 to 1500. I feel the main reason is debts... the higher your spending the higher chance you get into debts.,btohqsg
That principle is not wrong but using your standard to gauge each card is not appropriate,btohqsg
The main reason bank nerfs spending limit not because of debts but because people are earning too much bonus miles and bank are not profiting.Banks love debts that is where the good revenues is.,btohqsg
Not really  from bank‚Äôs perspective why would they care if you are in debts. The more you spend the happier they are. They lower it coz they are restricting people from getting bonus miles or cashback. If they have no max cap  those spending a lot would be able to redeem like a business class in one month. Now the cap of 1k limits people to hold the card for multiple months and yet still spending with the card,btohqsg
Hello! Buying klook voucher on heymax isit mcc5311 as stated on heymax?Can I use hsbc rev to get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Yup if the mcc is 5311,btohqsg
I ask you a question.If your citi bank credit card rewards is 6k... why they can't give you the same bonus spend also as 6k,btohqsg
I dont understand you  means you spend 6k they give you 6k miles?,btohqsg
If not because of debts... if you break the bonus earn of eg citi rewards spend bonus . 1500,btohqsg
You just said they dowan people to get into debts now you say not because of debts,btohqsg
You spend 3k on LV bag for your gal friend ... in the end you earn 1100   4 miles. The rest 1900 you earn only 1 miles,btohqsg
u wont fall 100% into debt just bexause u spend alot on your credit card... the only time u fall into debt is because u arent able to pay for ur expenses? how does that link to points or bonus ??,btohqsg
But you may be in trouble paying the 3k Lv bag,btohqsg
U wont be in trouble paying a 3k lv bag  u be in trouble if u spend what u cant pay.,btohqsg
then thats because of U not the BANK,btohqsg
Yes which concur my point valid. If you spend 3k  for your girl friend  they will you give you 12000 miles if there‚Äôs no cap on miles earning. So how does the bank profit from someone that just get 12k miles based on 1 transactions?,btohqsg
Yes... you can't pay... that's why citi bank won't reward you the 4 miles for that amount you can't pay,btohqsg
It can happen not just to credit card  if u buy a house and u cant pay the mortgage u also in trouble,btohqsg
That is completely 2 different issue  u are basically ownself say ownself hear.,btohqsg
Get rewards is not related in anyway to why banks don‚Äôt reward you the 4mpd. So if I have an unlimited cap of cashback  the banks won‚Äôt give me the rewards coz I can‚Äôt pay?,btohqsg
He saying you cannot afford 3k LV bag hahaha,btohqsg
I think he like attention lah.,btohqsg
Some banks they only reward you on the Base amount.. the full bonus will be rewarded at the end of the month,btohqsg
what about those with unlimited cashback like amex absolute cashback?,btohqsg
Hahahahhaa but it‚Äôs still awarded right? Do you hear what you are saying?,btohqsg
i think he think A say B type C ü§£,btohqsg
Bro Melvyn ask me to share my opinion,btohqsg
U really cant read the real meaning Melvyn mean ah,btohqsg
He ask you share opinion on why uob kf is better than ppv but you started on a whole new topic on banks worry you can‚Äôt pay,btohqsg
I say on the long run is better to use uob kris flyer...,btohqsg
Bank give u a credit limit  that is what is restricting the default risk  not the reward cap,btohqsg
Can you explain why? I‚Äôm very interested in knowing more,btohqsg
Because you are certain likely to use transport and also dining,btohqsg
Since hsbc nerb fast food. I believe uob kris flyer can use on that,btohqsg
I agree with what chris say.. you need to make it upsize to 10 $ a meal so that you will gain using preferred visa card....,btohqsg
you know what   it doesnt matter as long as you are happy üòä üåà,btohqsg
Ohhhh so if my meal not 10$ I cannot use ppv? Why ah?,btohqsg
you all wrong ... best credit card is crmc,btohqsg
I also feel the same as chris.... always have to think to spend 5 and above so to earn that rewards.... in the long run.. I feel uob kris flyer is more beneficial,btohqsg
Thank you for your wise advice. Should I use fairprice app with HSBC Revo for kopitiam dining? The food quite slow de.,btohqsg
But jialat leh  max only 1k. If I spend 3k on LV bag I cannot pay then bank no give me bonus miles,btohqsg
Which kopitiam you go? Mine very fast so I think my kopitiam considered fast food,btohqsg
Used to be can do it with ocbc rewards card... no more the case,btohqsg
Uob Krisflyer also in $5 Dollar spending block so i dont know what u are talking about to be honest,btohqsg
i will split my spending for my LV bag   1k crmc   1k hsbc   1k uob   1k ppv SETTLE then i wont be in debt,btohqsg
My kopitiam take about half an hour to serve wor. Think considered slow food... Need to know from@AdrainHoaif HSBC Revo okay for dining,btohqsg
It is more beneficial if you were to put dining  transport for this card... and also make sure to spend 800 on SQ  kris shop or Scoot per year,btohqsg
You will get the 3 miles for it. And also uob kris flyer is direct transfer miles to Sq kris flyer... so don't need worry about ophan points,btohqsg
I earn 4mpd compare to 3mpd and need to complete 800 spend per year. Maybe u talkinh about cap coz u dont hold alot of card. I got tons of card to spilt to earn max 4mpd,btohqsg
Actually side track  is it worth to use miles card as a cashback card? Like example since revo or crmc is more like a points systems that I can offset my bills. Or would I be better off using a cashback card,btohqsg
This one I not sure. Kopitiam card I put to uob preferred platinum visa,btohqsg
Why not your favourite UOB Kris Flyer?,btohqsg
during march there was a points to cashback conversion promotion  if u want cashback can wait till cashback conversion promotion and see whats the ratei think 3.8% from 2.5%,btohqsg
I cancel uob kris flyer previously.. they too slow to give bonus miles,btohqsg
But what if you can't pay $3k LV bag and don't get any miles?,btohqsg
"Iirc  Revo is 2.5pc and crmc is 2.2ish pc. I would think you're better off using ""specialised"" cashback cards like Citi Cashback (6pc on dining  grocery  8pc on transport) or Evol  but you'd have to look at your spending patterns of course",btohqsg
Yeaa I‚Äôm holding my points now  but the promotion is not confirmed one right? Like it‚Äôs not a quarterly or annually thing hor?,btohqsg
Lol i know no what if for myself haha  i got maybe 40 to 50 card for 2 player,btohqsg
i would wait ba   since points expiry after 37 months. Should have such promos sooner or later,btohqsg
Seriously I won't pay more than 1100 for a LV bag because it breaks the bonus cap for citi rewards,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have a fixed spending so I can‚Äôt really do those that require min spend.  Currently using revo for cashback instead but since the nerf  my usual spending was affected,btohqsg
But what if got orphan miles,btohqsg
let it expire better   such points no use anyway since cannot orphan,btohqsg
go atas shop do this very lao kui...,btohqsg
Thinking to adopt some orphan miles so they not lonely,btohqsg
lol I go dior  the sales assistant tellMe it‚Äôs commonLao Kui is old mindset liao.,btohqsg
I think can bargain with them. Maybe 3k bag become 1.1k. Just tell them your max cap for bonus miles only 1.1k,btohqsg
The more the rich is rich is because the more they particular with money,btohqsg
it won't be the best pseudo-cashback card you have  pretty average.but good news is the lack of minimum spending,btohqsg
No such thing as lao kui,btohqsg
U got to do what other wont do so u get what other dont get,btohqsg
Ohhh coz I‚Äôm seeing like other cashback cards is around 1.6-2% but revo is around 2.5. So it doesn‚Äôt seem like a bad choice for now but finding alternative for like third party travel and supermarket,btohqsg
Trust me  my face is thick enough to ask sales to spilt bill for me into different card or even cross month if the item is not urgent,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry.I did this @ Apple Store  LV and DiorAll sales assistant say it‚Äôs normal,btohqsg
I also do such thing.It‚Äôs the right way sis!,btohqsg
Waaa can cross month also ah  didn‚Äôt know that,btohqsg
Does ppl even know that alot of electronics store can do it,btohqsg
Only next time see if your face thick enough to ask them to discount LV bag from $3k to $1.1k üåö,btohqsg
That is not about face  cant afford luxury dont buy,btohqsg
True  the only luxury i can afford my phone üòï,btohqsg
other cashback can go up to 8/10%  but with conditions to go through like minimum spend lor  its a tradeoff.if you are just looking to earn something for categories that doesn't match with your main strategy/past rewards limits  this can work pretty well,btohqsg
Coz new phone 2k  my max cap for bonus miles is only 1k,btohqsg
They want to earn my money so why i need to feel ashame sia  i dont owe them a living leh.,btohqsg
Alot of uncle wear slipper and tshirt go buy mercedes de ok,btohqsg
Just realised hotel booking on Accor Hotels doesn‚Äôt earn 4mpd on HSBC Revo anymore while Marriott Group still does,btohqsg
Like i say before even warren buffet use coupon  so why need to feel lao kui sia,btohqsg
Ophan point loss I heart pain because all these are hard earn money,btohqsg
The other 1k in debt sia,btohqsg
Coz each hotel grp mcc different,btohqsg
If u accumulate 2 to 3 year still cant get enough point  maybe cashback card is better for u,btohqsg
Marriot is pretty good too if it‚Äôs available,btohqsg
I accumulate a lot until 2022 Dec. I redeem biz miles,btohqsg
Going kris silver lounge is really different ... when I have cash back card I never have the chance to step into lounge,btohqsg
Ya until 2022 and i dont know alot is how much to u,btohqsg
2021 I took my friend advise and move to the miles game. 2022 I redeem 42k for flight to hcm,btohqsg
Then where does the orphan point come in lol,btohqsg
By using citi rewards  1 year if u max out 1k per month  1 year is already 60k so somewhere along the line  some story dont fit,btohqsg
Coz 5k block to redeem miles but he got odd numbers,btohqsg
Orphan comes in when the scb bank changes its rule .. minimum transfer is 10k for transfer to kris flyer miles .. I transfer 35k to Sq account,btohqsg
Remaining 5k I can't transfer. I am upset,btohqsg
Most bank is minimum 10k block to transfer,btohqsg
for DBSWWMC quarter expiry (Those Expiring in June)  isit start june or end june,btohqsg
Maybe you can see if it worth it to spend to get the other 5k then transfer another 10k,btohqsg
I think I am missing something here.You still have the card?,btohqsg
So far I had never max out the whole 1k bonus cap,btohqsg
Cannot spend liao la.. later in debt,btohqsg
The highest I ever spend in a month 750 during Chinese new year,btohqsg
Then why you worry that bank lower their cap to 1k?,btohqsg
relax guys  he is just trying to say that there will always be left over miles that cant transfer  example you got 88k  only can transfer 80k  balance 8k stuck there. will take awhile to accumulate to redeem again.,btohqsg
When citi lazada card is gonna discontinue i also round up the point by spend to redeem in block.The lucky thing is i redeem all out with little orphan point  kena refund by merchant and my point end up in negative lol,btohqsg
U never see in another chat. Got someone sayRich people won‚Äôt need to waste time to save small money one..Zzzzzzzz üëéüèª,btohqsg
no need to scrunitise his word until so detail. read with pinch of salt. Dont get too agitated.,btohqsg
That's a problem when you want to cancel that card..  eg scb infinite visa,btohqsg
anyway ophan miles i will redeem for lame stuff. to clear out the miles and then cancel the carad,btohqsg
like my premier miles  got leftover 8k +  i use to get lendlease vouchers. then cancel the card.,btohqsg
Sis queen.. I just log into Internet ocbc . I can't find the travel under rewards,btohqsg
Please search ocbc reward redemption and click the appropriate link,btohqsg
okay thanks  then i can wait for my end may miles to come in before transferring.,btohqsg
if you read his chat from the past 1-2days u will know. and i dont think anyone is agitated,btohqsg
I am hot temper chilli human,btohqsg
if like trolling then just ignore lo haha.,btohqsg
Anyway I am glad to read about chris ... when everyone says uob preferred visa is very good.. he is able to share with us it's weak point... and also why he is giving up on this card.. thanks chris,btohqsg
U repeated this too much time liao  u know u can dm chris to thank him personally de,btohqsg
Until the day end  I still dk why ppv not good üòï,btohqsg

There is no bad cards  just how it suit your lifestyle,btohqsg
by ranked of importance  PPV prob on 5th of my list.,btohqsg
That's why some use ezlink card üëçüèª,btohqsg
You go to youtube search under chris .. you will know... bro.. because in the end whatever he mention. It really makes sense,btohqsg
If they think it is better why not  each to their own,btohqsg
Quite funny. But it will eventually become like max chat lol,btohqsg
i love the UOB Trio. Ladys   PPV   VS,btohqsg
Ya too much is not fun  it‚Äôs terror,btohqsg
Might need to lock him up in that group chat again,btohqsg
oh so u know the tale ü§°,btohqsg
There is no good/bad card.Only suitable/non-suitable card according to your lifestyle.I think you have to learn to live and let-live,btohqsg
Alright bro.. I will listen to the guys and ladies advise also.I will keep quiet .. or else later like other group got ban.. I be quiet.,btohqsg

Hi Guys and ladies. Need your advise on this.  Singlife saving account at 3%. Can advise on any risk involved  or capital guaranteed.  Thanks,btohqsg
The link you sent has all the answers to your question,btohqsg
How about the invested amount after maturity?,btohqsg
I saw it .. bro.What I worry is whether principal protect. Capital guarantees.. it is a insurance saving   whenever they put insurance I fear of capital whether protected .,btohqsg
Did you actually read the link you send?,btohqsg
Because it is something like a syfe management account  which is different from a bank saving account .. I have intention to put $$ in.. I have a bit of fear  any bros have put in this singlife account before. Any review.,btohqsg
This product has been around for a while. The biggest problem is $10k only. A bit waste time.But it‚Äôs safe.,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs capital guaranteed and sdic insured  what are you worried about?,btohqsg
10k at 3% isn‚Äôt even worth it,btohqsg
Scared don't put Put don't scared,btohqsg
Bros. Because I have put in about 20k at stash uob account at about 2% plus per annum.. now I looking for something higher than 2%++,btohqsg
Uob one  ocbc 360  maribank  tbills  SSB? All gives you more than 2% at a higher than 10k cap. Why even bother with uob stash in the first place,btohqsg
With all the salary loopholes  you can have 150k in uob one  100k each in ocbc 360  dbs multiplier. Still got excess? Dump them into hsbc ega. All of the above provides more than 3%... Why bother with anything less with such a low cap?,btohqsg
You want something safe and capital guaranteed  tbills loh. Easily more than 3%,btohqsg
Now  the 5 eligible transaction cannot transfer money to another account 5 times? Need to use the credit card?,btohqsg
Spore saving bonds already invested also...,btohqsg
Just that the saving Stash account uob per annum is low,btohqsg
We have given you so many other options  yet you still hung up on the SSB and stash. I mean if you want to go for singlife go ahead ah  it‚Äôs your money,btohqsg
i think even if you ask meta AI  im sure meta ai can recommend many more than 2%.just need to do some reading some watching of youtube videos.,btohqsg
I think he watch but don‚Äôt comprehend,btohqsg
Alright bros. Thanks for your advise.,btohqsg
spend some time watching videos and doing some reading. I am sure you will get more returns rather than asking here.there is a search button here also  im sure if you spend the time to search  there's definitely more returns,btohqsg
Assuming 200k SSB  150k UOBone  100k OCBC. Got alot of place to put for safe fund liao. If need or want more can get RM to 'recommend' liao. All more than 2%.,btohqsg
Is there a data point on what constitutes into the 500 spending for ocbc 360? Not sure if insurance counts since it‚Äôs counted for uob one,btohqsg
yea but i think i saw insurance premiums not counted,btohqsg
He deposit in Singapore pools maybe more than 2%,btohqsg
As usual read up tnc on ocbc website to be 100 percent confirm,btohqsg
i also know but seeing if anyone tried before,btohqsg
Follow the tnc and u wont be wrong. Have never heard of ppl say paying insurance work for ocbc card,btohqsg
Does anyone know if buying ntuc vouchers count towards eligible spend for Citibank cashback+?,btohqsg
from HSBC  after i asked them about my qualification for Everyday Awards:,btohqsg
If I sign for City Prestige and use it to pay Tax through Cardup  does that count toward qualifying spend,btohqsg
Hi all want to ask1) Justgrab/grabcar/standard taxi(under grab app) all should be same MCC correct(4121)?2) If I link my amaze to services such as grab for direct payment to grab transport/food  is not under MCC excluded by both amaze and CRMC  so will not incur the 1% amaze fees right?(I know grab services is online and don't need amaze  but I'm doing this because I still have not hit the $1000 cap),btohqsg
as long as not over 1k amaze  wont incur fee,btohqsg
Hey people  for ocbc 360 account. I have maintained avg balance of 100 000 and got the 4.65% bonus. Calculated is $387.50  but the website stated $394.90.How did they get that number?,btohqsg
It could be because of the number of days of the month etc,btohqsg
At the bottom  got put 394.90 is calculated at 31 day basis,btohqsg
How does the number of days matter if the interest is calculated based on the maximum is 100k and if you can maintain the average of 100k?,btohqsg
One month earn 387.5 because  394.90 = 31 days  1 day = 12.70  1 year 365 days = 4649.6  1 month = 4649.6/12 = 387.50,btohqsg
Becus interest is calculated based on 365 days per year  $394.90 is 31 days  if u take 12 month is 372 days so is wrong,btohqsg
So we should be getting in the actual amount $387.50 every month as long as we maintained the 100k and criteria right?,btohqsg
OCBC website stated it is based on number of days as well,btohqsg
Depending on number of days in the month. Use the formulae provided and you can calculate yourself. For months with 28 days  the amount will be lesser  make sense?,btohqsg
387.50 is the amount u get on months such as April  June etc that has 30 days,btohqsg
On months with 28 days and 31 days  it will vary slightly,btohqsg
Interest earned is calculated daily.Account holder earns interest $4650/365 = $12.739 per day.You can calculate how many days in the month n how much you earn by using formula(num of days) X $12.739,btohqsg
for those that buy travel insurance for a single trip   normally which brand do you buy and how much? i am looking at etiqa and fwd   both seems pretty cheap with quite good overall coverage,btohqsg
was looking at fwd yesterday looks good,btohqsg
I was wondering if the 6 month T-bills make sense at estimated 3.7% pa. this is still lower than inflation  right?,btohqsg
Hi anybody got singsaver contact no.? They refused to fulfill my reward and keep pushing between their teams,btohqsg
yeah thats why i was comparing it i think the cheapest would be fwd and etiqa that gives good coverage,btohqsg
UOB Big Savings Payout interest is in for those who credited in Apr.,btohqsg
oh just to update you   the bill came out to be 65.1  for scaling and polishing,btohqsg
Wrong. Interest calculation is same as UOB One account interest.Base interest is calculated daily. 0.05% p.a. √ó end of day balance.Bonus interest is calculated at end of month  based on average daily balance. Eligible bonus interest % p.a. √ó average daily balance.But ultimately the base interest calculated is negligible as it's a flat 0.05% p.a. for all amounts  so if your average daily balance is 100k  even with any fluctuation  it should still be 100k √ó 0.05% p.a.,btohqsg
My answer is referring to OP question of $100k MAB.,btohqsg
Still  bonus interest is not calculated daily. Only base interest is.,btohqsg
Any info on bigfundr investment and how much they charge for managing. How do all expert think of this.üòä,btohqsg
Does anyone know if I can redeem my crmc points into my wife‚Äôs KrisFlyer account?,btohqsg
If she has the same name as you,btohqsg
i think gxs now is waiting list,btohqsg
Citi customer service tried to convince me otherwise  probably cause I‚Äôm trying to cancel the card üòÇ,btohqsg
Moral of the story: if anybody wants to be deep in miles game  marry the one that has the same name as you. ü´¢,btohqsg
no need to marry same name  just both change to the same name ü§£,btohqsg
Hi jen  thanks for sharing  how much do they charge for managing your portfolio of 50k. So far can share your understanding about the investment.,btohqsg
GXS invites have halted for now. You need to wait for the next wave and pray that they invite you. Anyway Maribank gives more than GXS for now.,btohqsg
Just convert to your acct and add wife as nominee can liao,btohqsg
Anyone else UOB credit card due dates shifted to 31 May this month? Normally is start of the month,btohqsg
Guys and ladies.Team cash back vs air milesWho you think will win,btohqsg
Team use whatever cards is suitable for your lifestyle.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/200052,btohqsg
Yes agree bro... I got a feeling that team miles may win,btohqsg
Your card due date is always based on your statement date. You can check with CSO on UOB chat assist for your statement date.,btohqsg
I mean if only 1 person votes on his own poll  the side he votes will always win. ü§°,btohqsg
I will say with only 2 % more but with so much risk..... Better think through..... Anyway it is your money. This is not financial advise.,btohqsg
Bros ... just to share about travel 1 card. Now the air partners and hotels likely to kick in by end of this month ... they seem now very strong partners with airlines and hotels,btohqsg
No conversion fee until 2025 too,btohqsg
Does anyone know if it's counted as online spending if I buy eCapita vouncher using EVOL?,btohqsg

Hi all  I saw that many recommend pairing CRMC + Amaze. Just wondering  is it worth to pair Amaze with Uob Lady's as well?,btohqsg
Ya if u spending overseas but lady is mcc specific,btohqsg
Anyone know why they say that hey max reliability is 1 star ?Also how to access DBS digibot,btohqsg
Because heymax's data is based on the registered merchant data with the network. But merchants can do funny things with mcc some times. And heymax search might not yield the exact merchant you wnat,btohqsg
Yea it‚Äôs already proven that self transfer worksCan used the search bar to see what other have posted,btohqsg
Block dbs card and spend  then use digibot to check on the spending,btohqsg
Did you even see the previous messages lol,btohqsg
This is for recurring transfer without purpose  just reference code  instead of the standard transfer.,btohqsg
What kind of funny thing tho? So does that mean that not all are accurate and might not get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Like that trust card also can be used to check right.Just spend $1 and ask the customer service,btohqsg
so you did recurring transfer and what did you write as reference?,btohqsg
Idk if customer service will tell you. If online just use amaze card to try,btohqsg
So far they keep telling me what it isBut trust is visa,btohqsg
good to know that works instead of needing to use standard transfer. Thank you for trying :),btohqsg
Mcc nothing to do with visa or Mastercard what,btohqsg
As in they will tell you,btohqsg
has anyone heard of uob lockaway account? does anyone know what the effective interest rate is..? thank u very much in advance,btohqsg
LOL have la. Each visa and master mcc is different. But more less they are the sameAnd heymax follow visa iirc,btohqsg
"Hahaha ok thank you. My grandmother wants to put for ""peace of mind"". but looks bad to me",btohqsg
lockaway is the one which is super protected and doesn't allow any transactions etc. to protect customers from being cheated. not good interest rates,btohqsg
Then why you worry heymax not accurate since you have your own methods,btohqsg
Any withdrawal of funds must be done in-person at any of the UOB branches in Singapore btw,btohqsg
thank you very much for your reply,btohqsg
My question was why isn‚Äôt it accurate Compared to digibot lol,btohqsg
More or less it‚Äôs the same. Not much of a difference for general mcc,btohqsg
Peace of mind then ask her only use the account to withdraw cash lo.. don't use other digital services..,btohqsg
Just make sure you don't have an actual salary credited in or don't do any manual transfers in with salary payment as reason. Then let the recurring transfer do it's thing.,btohqsg
‚ÄúAnyone know why they say that hey max reliability is 1 star ?Also how to access DBS digibot‚ÄùDon‚Äôt really see how the question is related to digibot being more accurate,btohqsg
I dunno why any bank doesn't have a person 2FA. like you can be the second authoriser for grandparent/parent.,btohqsg
Then might as well don't let them withdraw or use card. And you do it for them.,btohqsg
But then one of the account holder can still authorise the transaction. I doubt it actually prevents anything,btohqsg
@MelvynEzithis is only for online transactions maybe? to prevent scams@clowninwithsalmonyea the authoriser being the one less likely to fall for scam,btohqsg
Lockaway account only let account holder withdraw personally at branch over the counter. No other ways to utilise the money.,btohqsg
yea  I was thinking of something in between full freedom and full restriction :),btohqsg
You keep their money  and give them supp card with low limit?,btohqsg
that one also a good idea. guess old people don't use much of online transfer etc.,btohqsg
does the failed tx appear immediately like amaze?,btohqsg
Do you have the formula for the bonus interest?,btohqsg
wow i am getting zonked..any difference whether the BASE interest is calculated DAILY or based on MAB?when the rate is 0.05% p.a. regardless?Daily calculation vs MAB calculation should only matter if tiered/capped right?,btohqsg
hmmm.. UOB made some changes? even a $7k transfer to Other Bank (my own name) now requires your 6 digit Online Banking pin.,btohqsg
No difference if not tiered and not capped,btohqsg
Hi  would like to ask about the Simply Cash 0 fx fee cashback  would agoda bookings count as Eligible Foreign Currency Transactions? read the tnc but not sure if it counts,btohqsg
But is it actually worth it? I see that there‚Äôs a cap of 50$ on the cashback you get,btohqsg
yea  mean cap at around $1500. i need to make hotel/domestic airline bookings for an upcoming trip  so was wondering if agoda would be eligible.before that i didn't realise the min spending  thought i could use it for the domestic airfare haha. maybe i'll just clock the $800 üòÖ,btohqsg
Anybody tried the webull existing clients promotion?,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs like 2500 min spend  but the promotion not very attractive with the cap and min spend to qualify,btohqsg
If i am a sub card holder of HSBC  am i still consider a new customer ?,btohqsg
thanks you for the response appreciate it,btohqsg
You know got ppl will touch touch then the MAB become dk what kind of number one... ü§°,btohqsg
Is there a scenario where y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt use amaze+linked card when transacting overseas? I‚Äôm thinking that if the fx spread is more than the rewards I would get then possibly no but still wanna hear what the rest thinks.,btohqsg
When I reached the 1k cap for crmc,btohqsg
Hmm yea that too but thinking is it even worth pairing ocbc inf to amaze for my overseas trip,btohqsg
Not worth for most cashback card  only one i pair is maybank fnf,btohqsg
feasible cashback cards linked to amaze are:1. citibank cashback master2. maybank fnf,btohqsg
Can understand why only these 2? Coz of the higher cashback rate?,btohqsg
yeah these are the 2 highest cashback mastercards i am aware of,btohqsg
(dbs mastercards cannot be linked to amaze as it disqualifies them from earning rebates),btohqsg
Hi bros and sisters.Would like to check. How to know how much uob $ is at ladies credit card  if I have total of about 25 300,btohqsg
Because I not intended to transfer all to kris flyer account  as I surrender the uob preferred visa card,btohqsg
i read your question 5 times i have no idea what u are asking,btohqsg
i assume he is asking as he has lady‚Äôs and ppv  since the points pool  if he were to cancel the ppv would he get to keep the full uni$ he currently has,btohqsg
As UNI$ (NOT UOB$) is pooled  it doesn't matter if you cancel an existing miles card  as long as you still have AT LEAST ONE UNI$ (miles) card left  you will still have access to all the pooled UNI$,btohqsg
As you know uob cards can be pooled. I want to make sure points earn from uob preferred card is fully transfer to kris flyer miles before I cancel the card. And also not take away the points earn from uob ladys credit card.,btohqsg
your first sentence is inconsistent with the body of your paragraphyou have already correctly said uob cards are pooled.so whatever miles your UOB PPV and UOB Lady earned is all in ONE SAME POOL. It is not allocated to any card.,btohqsg
That's why I checked with you guys how to checked how many points are exist at uob ladies card now. As now the pdf statement show pooled uob $ points,btohqsg
whatever miles your UOB PPV and UOB Lady earned is all in ONE SAME POOL. It is not allocated to any card.,btohqsg
What they are saying is it does not matter if u cancel pvv the point stay in the pool,btohqsg
So if I transfer 25k to kris flyer. Then 300 remaining uob $ points remain with uob lady card right,btohqsg
Hi what can i do if my wise physical card lost?,btohqsg
Can i use the app to make transaction? do wise accept samsung pay  gpay?,btohqsg
no.. the remaining UNI$ remains with UOB (not assigned to any card),btohqsg
Ask them issue a new one?,btohqsg
You should probably block it and get new one right,btohqsg
Anyone know the mcc code for uob car loan?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think loans or PIP qualify for any rewards,btohqsg
Swimming pool same pool not? üëÄ,btohqsg
I think your priorities a bit wrong ah? You should be blocking and requesting for replacement... Then use digital card for time being... Or even better  use digital card where possible lol.,btohqsg
Bro. How you lost the wise card..,btohqsg
Maybe he dropped inside the pool,btohqsg
One card only so no multiple pool,btohqsg
IQ drop into pool also.. but don't know which pool,btohqsg
Haha don't worry  not talking about you. Talking about swimming pools,btohqsg
Misplaced while youre overseas  many reasons. If theft  of course. Freeze it.,btohqsg
Very common to lose things. You lose your wise card  others lose brain cells. ü§°,btohqsg
So to whom who dont know  not all country accept 6 digit pin  some accept 4 pins  for e.g wise. And knowing you have loaded your money to wise  you can use digital card  from the app itself or google pay?,btohqsg
Use Google Pay need to key pin on terminal? For YouTrip I know the only time I key pin is using physical card to withdraw from ATM.,btohqsg
Moomoo retroactively amended the TnCs of the promo - if you‚Äôre in it now you have to maintain the net deposit assets in moomoo til 16/07/2024 or you won‚Äôt get your cash coupon üôÉ,btohqsg

Same  I also can't find need to lock in till 16th July,btohqsg
FAQ point 13 (was revised yesterday):During the event period (1/4/2024. 10:00PM SGT to 16/7/2024  9:59PM SGT)  please maintain the net deposit asset in account (any asset type including stocks/ funds/ cash etc).

Hi all. Would like to seek which miles credit card would be best to pair with cardup for income tax if the monthly instalment is more than 1k? Thanks.,btohqsg
Depend on what card u hold  those with the most base mile would be good. Like uob privi 1.4 mpd  dbs vantage 1.5 mpd  dbs altitutde 1.3 mpd,btohqsg
That‚Äôs a nice income. Can qualify for most cards  including vantage,btohqsg
For UOB PRVI  there is no cap to the miles I can earn per month right? Not sure whether I read it correctly from online..,btohqsg
Yes no cap for base miles,btohqsg
Why now then you ask about tax. The deadline for personal tax is April 18,btohqsg
I‚Äôm going to use Amaze + CRMC and UOB Lady‚Äôs Solitaire.Then use HSBC Revol for miscellaneous spendings.Intend to pair cardup with UOB PRVI for income tax  mortgage and car loans.Hope this plan is a good one to earn miles.,btohqsg
I file mine pay on 30th March also card up,btohqsg
Can still make changes to how we pay the income tax right?,btohqsg
Because I only started researching about credit cards  amaze and cardup in recent weeks‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Apply more will be tempted to spend more üòÖ,btohqsg
That I not sure.. better call them up immediately Thursday morning to ask..  if not may be fine for late filing,btohqsg
Do u have problem understanding? Ppl ask which card to pay cardup u come say late file?,btohqsg
For me ... I can't like you think of using which one . I need to make a decision fast either citi pay all or card up....,btohqsg
I mean is really late now sister... because the deadline is already up on April 18,btohqsg
This questions should be ask earlier around March time,btohqsg
People want suggestion on what card to use for monthly income tax payment. What is the intention to mention late file sia? They can decide to switch to cardup anytime after their monthly tax start.Pls dont input non useful filler info to confuse the chat,btohqsg
Anyone who applied for HSBC cc for the current promo has received confirmation of approval?,btohqsg
Correct me if I am wrong.. you mean if you pay already.. can still email to Iras to change,btohqsg

Alright.. I also learning from you,btohqsg

hi want to ask using crmc by taking bus/mrt  will get any points on it??,btohqsg
That's selective reading bro... The paragraph you had quoted ties with scenario 2... Read scenario 1 separately as well...Edited: oh wait  actually after reading it again  I'm unsure if that paragraph could applies to both scenarios as well. But I take it as so long we fulfil the net deposit throughout the entire activity period  we will get our rewards. If they were to apply strictly the literal meaning of that paragraph  it simply means all of us who did not maintain the net deposit throughout the entire extended promo periodmaybe denied the rewards. <- doesn't make sense to me and it's a PR disaster if they really deny people who fufiled the requirement prior to this revision.13. When will the cash reward from 6.8%p.a. be issued?The cash reward will be issued according to the following scenarios:Scenario 1If your activity period (20/40/60 day) has ended before 16/7/2024 9:59pm SGT  the rewardwillbe issued within 14 working days after 16/7/2024 9:59PM SGT.Scenario 2If your activity period (20/40/60 day) is ending after 16/7/2024 9:59PM SGT   the reward will be issued within 7 working days after the end of the countdown timer on the event landing page.During the event period (1/4/2024. 10:00PM SGT to 16/7/2024  9:59PM SGT)  please maintain the net deposit asset in account (any asset type including stocks/ funds/ cash etc). Otherwise the reward eligibility may not be fulfilled even if you have completed the holding period of 20/40/60 day.,btohqsg
Wasei  how can they do that,btohqsg
very unfair.  Now thinking of closing the account.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre not going to get any returns  just leave it inside loh,btohqsg
It is a matter of principle,btohqsg
lol what principle? Anything is still subjected to tnc.,btohqsg
ok if they stated at start of promotion.  However  just anyhow change in the middle of promotion.  But I guess you are right  everything is subject to changes.  So  can anytime change anything. ;-),btohqsg
Based on your logic  banks cannot change their credit card tnc exclusions etc coz it would be a principle issue?,btohqsg
Ppl brain late filing also we cannot help,btohqsg
Drop IQ down into the swimming pool liao,btohqsg
Banks typically give advance notice for TnC revisions though.Since the moomoo promo is for a fixed discrete period they could have just revise TnCs for future promo  but they woke up and chose violence ü•≤,btohqsg
Their principle is still there  they stayed true to their t&c  where states that t&c can change anytime  without prior announcements.,btohqsg
Well yes and no. If you sign up for a card today and they release the notice tmr  is that considered advanced for you? So it differs based on person.And if you read the tnc of moomoo  they say they can choose to revise the tnc at any point of time without noticeMoomoo SG reserves the right to: (i) amend these Campaign/Promotion Terms and Conditions at any time without prior notice to you  and (ii) change  withdraw or terminate any offer or reward without disclosing the reason and without making compensation or remuneration. Any adjustments or decisions made by Moomoo SG in connection with this Campaign/Promotion shall be binding on all participants.,btohqsg
