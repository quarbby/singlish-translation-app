This year dh that anymore  meaning if u do that  you'll still retest but marks uncounted for,btohqsg
some joker asked what if I strategically MC for 3 WAs and Cher responded with oh then hm case by case basis but obv eoy is 100%,btohqsg
Cause no more mye ma  now is 3 WAs each 15% and eoy is 55%,btohqsg
I was sibei dulan last year,btohqsg
Literally half or more ppl Mia just to retake on another day,btohqsg
They complain oh not enough time etc etc,btohqsg
One classmate of mine cheated and apparently got snitched on by the one who helped her cheat,btohqsg
Tho Cher said despite her cheating  WA didn't rlly do well,btohqsg
Cheat as in she saw the qns prior,btohqsg
wait how do you see the questions and still fuck yo,btohqsg
I also dk why tf the mastermind confess her deeds,btohqsg
I did see also ah and I didn't do well,btohqsg
It was minutes prior to the test,btohqsg
But I wouldn't have either tbh HAHA,btohqsg
that context would’ve been good to have,btohqsg
uni is when i realised profs can fuck me up even if they give full open book,btohqsg
actually esp bc it’s open book,btohqsg
You reminded me of the memes,btohqsg
Where ppl squeeze everything onto onto one A4 or A3 size paper,btohqsg
did i tell you about the phd class one,btohqsg
oh yeah i’ve seen it irl LOL,btohqsg
Oh shit it's actually a thing?,btohqsg
But for econs wa it  was only one qn with many parts  that's all,btohqsg
But econs isn't the type whr u can score despite seeing it's qns,btohqsg
Math can ah but I didn't cause I wuv math,btohqsg
Uk I was damn lucky cause for one of my math WAs they use past JC qns and  just nice i did em before,btohqsg
yeah if you don’t have it you js don’t,btohqsg
with math tbh you can look up smth similar in a few mins and get smth,btohqsg
wouldn’t be lucky if you didn’t do last time so not rlly luck,btohqsg
yup esp one mod that let us type so font size as small as possible,btohqsg
Bluntly speaking  I would've anw cause I was sorta good  in the topics😳🙈 like I can't believe I'm saying this but throughout my sec sch and  retaking Os  my math either damn good  stagnated or improved by a few grades(last year),btohqsg
I am literally about to lose my shit,btohqsg
Fking documents disappearing when i save them,btohqsg
It's also Cher damn good ah  he spoonfed us  like nursery kids,btohqsg
Nvr rlly had to study after sch,btohqsg
I have spent 30mins trying to find them,btohqsg
Just flip thru notes can alr,btohqsg
Maybe check the trash or smth,btohqsg
i even purposely chose the place to store the document,btohqsg
im quite literally spamming save now,btohqsg

Nah i have 100gb left on laptop,btohqsg

Garlic is niceI rmb there was a time I ate raw garlic clove p frequently,btohqsg
You could sleep early and stay up in the early morning instead  that way you will be better able to plan when you receive your results.I think if you score badly initially that you can retake as a private candidate to attend your preferred JC/MI rather than immediately apply to a full-time course at ITE.ITE also has once a week general education O level courses (https://www.ite.edu.sg/courses/part-time-courses/general-education/application-and-fees) where you can study to take the O levels exams again at a subsidized rate of ~$30/subject (this includes the exam fees  which are subsidized this way).You have a ~>=65% chance of scoring well enough to enter JC/MI according to previously published statistics  so the odds are in your favour.,btohqsg
I shat my pants during first parade,btohqsg
i wanna be there if you two meet irl,btohqsg
fk HELP HAHAHA idk whats gg on but im here for the tea,btohqsg
Eh pls u guys we ain't filming a fking kdrama 😭,btohqsg

Ya what it's ard same time as zhen huan zhuan,btohqsg
The actor whose role is the emperor was like idk if we can compete with huan Zhu gege but we'll just go with the flow ig,btohqsg
I wear it like a badge,btohqsg
At least I'm old enough to date yt,btohqsg
if we’re talking legally not socially acceptable,btohqsg
more of my mom but i watched too,btohqsg
Yea. But the original one in late 90s is the bestest,btohqsg
she actually watched the entire 爱 too,btohqsg
Ohh I shld rlly check it out,btohqsg
you’re really bringing up childhood memories for me,btohqsg
My chi improved alot after that   such that my clb Cher said I can actly try h1 chi 🗿🗿  TO MY CLB PPL  YOU CAN DO IT,btohqsg
I always watch that and the old 9pm shows,btohqsg
Usually it's that one first followed by the 9pm shows,btohqsg
random fact but my grandpa even performed the op of it at a getai stage,btohqsg
That's why the show leaves an even more long-lasting impression on me,btohqsg
damn ngl thats impressive from clb to h1 chi,btohqsg
He say say only lah but then he add on I'll still have to push way more if I were to actly take it,btohqsg
i have no clue what the standard is,btohqsg
i did my hcl and became monolingual from that moment on,btohqsg
looking back ngl i should take hcl to get the minus 2 from o lvl,btohqsg
I rmb alot of HCl ppl dreading doing essays,btohqsg
Nearing their Os in sec 3 they kept spamming essays to hand up,btohqsg
i was from ip so my mind was just focused on not touching chinese for a levels,btohqsg
probs bc o levels didnt matter for me,btohqsg
Aye is it true that when IP guys enlist  they're normally the youngest in their batch,btohqsg
uhh anyone that came from jc too would be same?,btohqsg
but got some dudes enlisted at 16,btohqsg
Weird leh this IP friend of mine said he was the youngest,btohqsg
got the jc intake   poly intake and jc ite intake,btohqsg
wish got brains for ip sadge,btohqsg
ya the usual is 18 after ur A lvls,btohqsg
I still rmb my psle code,btohqsg
my chers told me to work hard to get to express  got 204(didnt rly study lol) and went to a 188 sch lol,btohqsg
But i heard some NA streams like no diff to exp cause high cutoff pt,btohqsg
Even if u met criteria for promo to exp  some sch damn CB don't let u promo,btohqsg
* i didnt study for psle*,btohqsg
saves u a year at least,btohqsg
My time to go exp is ard 190 and above,btohqsg
some good sch have 1 NA class only,btohqsg
even express  our class pretty noisy lmao,btohqsg
and imo shit express class still better than good na class,btohqsg
I did and got 186 skull,btohqsg
looking back legit i went sch for the vibes,btohqsg
really wish i early bloomer siah  last time i didnt understand the need to look thru past ws,btohqsg
dont even study until sec 3,btohqsg
u taking o this yr right,btohqsg
if below 11 den dont talk to me,btohqsg
"i rmb my mindset then was ""i eat i sleep i rest good can liao""",btohqsg
"My tuition friend mom told my mom  "" wow she Kai qiao alr""",btohqsg
like the E or A math paper majority of the class got A2 or A1,btohqsg
the math aint mathing when i heard it lol,btohqsg
top 30% grade achieved by 60% of the class,btohqsg
either everyone suddenly smart or the teachers being soft  idk which 1 more likely u tell me,btohqsg
i bloomed early then died early,btohqsg
I peaked only in sec 2-3,btohqsg
ill peak when i get a gf frfr,btohqsg
i simultaneously hate and love studying now lol,btohqsg
but just tell myself only ah,btohqsg
not a ipad user i guess,btohqsg
still learning how to use it,btohqsg
i feel like goodnotes is legit jus fullscape paper on ipad,btohqsg
i used it briefly but now i use samsung,btohqsg
i use before but not a fan,btohqsg
i tried drawing my electrical circuit using that,btohqsg
shit was damn bad too draw,btohqsg
if can you think he will go meh,btohqsg
What time ns normally lights out,btohqsg
Clearly It won't work in kranji,btohqsg
normally how much admin time for bmt?,btohqsg
sometimes during periods bef POP u will hv shit ton of admin tim,btohqsg
but rarely u will get one,btohqsg
I just realized 爱 is WA MENG ti WA MENG ti op,btohqsg
either fat batch or fail ippt batch  .means BMT is longer cuz extra PT,btohqsg
i technically got a month worth of offs for last year,btohqsg
once clearing leave and the one block leave bef RTU,btohqsg
17 weeks means you get more pt to pass ippt but other stuff also gets spread out a bit more,btohqsg
then maybe ard 1-2months cuz SCDF roster thing,btohqsg
I got 2 day MC today and tmr  shld I go sch still,btohqsg
enhanced i sometimes used to end at 8pm on a regular basis,btohqsg
I mean if u think of it  it's kinda dumb to go sch since I  paid for mc,btohqsg
pay for mc?oooohhh oh god@chemcerand I can't relate,btohqsg
Oh ya also I alr submitted the MC for 2 days thru the link,btohqsg
latest i had smth when i in tekong was like after dinner i guess,btohqsg
was a tight day with afternoon pt to dinner straight away,btohqsg
sgt  told to to change to admin and come down in 5 mins,btohqsg

@Polarbearnextdoormy official S4 branch chat in SIR is on Tele,btohqsg
when the rest just change and go down,btohqsg
u do that sgt will kena fk u,btohqsg
Dude they don't go back and reteach the pu1 stuff,btohqsg
Functions transformation graph sequence series vectors,btohqsg
got no revellie and no lights out time here,btohqsg
Ya that mi dude is prob another Caleb or he on drugs,btohqsg
I mean I what I saidd,btohqsg
I got send the pic in this chat b4,btohqsg
idk but i'm assuming she's done with all the newtonian mechanics stuff,btohqsg
i mean schools don't always follow that order,btohqsg
Idk man last year we learn to some chap then skip and jump to other chap,btohqsg
Back then not alot of ppl from mi went uni,btohqsg
I quote them apparently the staff here  say not quite like b4 liao,btohqsg
measurements  kinematics  dynamics  wep  circular motion,btohqsg
I mean the Cher here said it's rlly self directed learning  if uw do well can't solely rely on the sch system or wtv,btohqsg
Idk how is mi is actly diff from JC but I thought both mi and JC are pre u,btohqsg
do a quick rinse and change,btohqsg
i kinda disagree with that sentiment,btohqsg
ok but my stance is more for uni,btohqsg
i mean you also dk what extent that one is,btohqsg
sounds like you're projecting a bit,btohqsg
from my experience some people that do this only do it bc they not sure,btohqsg
a lot of poly and uni aren't as familiar with the material as you'd want them to be,btohqsg
or it's way too trivial to them that they can't relate to the student's struggle,btohqsg
from uni onwards i just take the prof's lectures and notes as one resource then study myself with other things i find,btohqsg
idk about poly but uni need to submit proposal and all that,btohqsg
teaching prepped content takes diff skills from answering questions,btohqsg
I mean it's a pre u,btohqsg
uni for me is better but idk ntu physics profs are generally p good from what i've experienced,btohqsg
Like here in MI the teachers q good leh they even actually chase u for hw uk,btohqsg
but i've also only consulted prof for clarification once before,btohqsg
and that's during my final undergrad year,btohqsg
Like I feel bad for the Chers cause alot of students dl hand up hw,btohqsg
Altho u barely pay for sch fres,btohqsg
It's kinda stupid to not make full use of them,btohqsg
Like for me right   if you'd only just ask  the Cher confirm try to help one way or another,btohqsg
I'll really rip out Ur Einstein hair irl,btohqsg
I hope u end up balding,btohqsg
learning to find ways to study and learn even if the lecturer is bad is a v important skill,btohqsg
esp in uni where every prof has their own funny way of doing things,btohqsg
like word for word i asked one of my profs before,btohqsg
then he explained how uni isn't just teaching you content,btohqsg
the prof isn't going to give you every bit of info you need,btohqsg
Like when I was retaking  I also figured out my way of learning,btohqsg
Which I unfortunately didnt manage to during Os,btohqsg
(but if they suck at answering questions that's another thing),btohqsg
u have a pt lah  everybody's oughta be responsible for their own learning outcomes,btohqsg
Not blame the lecturer esp if he can't teach,btohqsg
It takes two hands to clap,btohqsg
poly onwards you're paying mainly for the qualification,btohqsg
but i think adapting to the way things work kinda evolves into how you'll have to handle things when working,btohqsg
Those who ask him qns typically learn beforehand alr,btohqsg
I rlly like my new Econs teacher tho,btohqsg
you want qualified people to teach but self directed learning is fr really important,btohqsg
ig aside from the qualification itself,btohqsg
self learning skills outside of an institute setting has long shown to be not that effective,btohqsg
Because he's so long winded   some of the stuff he mention is alr him teaching the content,btohqsg
and the stories he'd share is v funny and int imo,btohqsg
But alot of students sleep in class,btohqsg
Gd luck to all the o lvl student tmr !,btohqsg
Is self learning skills considered a soft skill,btohqsg
but it's like a bare minimum,btohqsg
if you rely on people spoonfeeding you idk how you survive in working world,btohqsg
I kinda wanna go but I got math hw due tmr and it's incomplete,btohqsg
Send msg asking for  extension but Cher haven't read,btohqsg
It's all of my pu1 chapters,btohqsg
then next 9 weeks is what,btohqsg
Ik but I rlly wan go for econs lecture,btohqsg
but the actual bmt stuff is spread a bit into the first 8 weeks too,btohqsg
It's not like I hate econs  I just suck at it,btohqsg
i started doing route march within first few weeks lol,btohqsg
have been studying chem for days continuously for hours on end,btohqsg
im getting sick of this subject,btohqsg
how was your 17 week bmt,btohqsg
uhhh i didn't finish it let's it bc some medical stuff (i swear nvr ck),btohqsg
for the past almost 1 week,btohqsg
i have been studying chem everyday,btohqsg
😭ive been worrying like one dawg since 9 nov,btohqsg
doing practice questions from o levels,btohqsg
i already read finish the book idk how many times,btohqsg
but im trying to make sure it sinks in,btohqsg
kuro i'm like so behind my work,btohqsg
but i read until sian alr,btohqsg
it's times like these where i'm annoyed i can't pay people to do for me,btohqsg
im preparing for some online comp,btohqsg
that’s why im mugging chem like hell,btohqsg
and i still don’t fully process it,btohqsg
most I can do for chem is probably take a day off and focus on other subjects,btohqsg
and then proceed to study chem again everyday until 20th jan,btohqsg
just wanna prepare as much as possible so i don’t tell myself on the actual day “oh i could’ve done more”,btohqsg
i cannot tell whether im already burnt out or not,btohqsg
I just wanted to recap 😭,btohqsg
i think it would be fun if i print pages out the pure science and h2 chem recap notes,btohqsg
And put it on my bedroom walls,btohqsg
so that when I wake up,btohqsg
do uk any Tele chem/phy grp chat like paradigm,btohqsg
Be it for Os or As,btohqsg
The a lvl tele chat lor,btohqsg
At this point u are overloading urself,btohqsg
But i wont advice u on what to do coz,btohqsg
Different people have diff ball game,btohqsg
And clearly u just build diff,btohqsg
Uk everytime I see Ur name  I'm reminded of someone who somehow broke a burette Infront of me,btohqsg
it's a sign to brain rot,btohqsg
Also if Im only learning and solidifying Os stuff last year  I wouldn't be able to help a tiny bit in As chat alr,btohqsg
It's both solidifying and learning abit of As stuff along the way,btohqsg
prolly another day of feeling tired at sch,btohqsg
If my WA1 all As then say first,btohqsg
if your WA1 all As i buy hdl for you,btohqsg
