With current petrol price  it actually quite hard to sell car for a profit also,btohqsg
but if i not selling then up or down don't matter la lol,btohqsg
Yours is a special car. With js. Don sell.,btohqsg
I just sold a Honda Fit  I bought brand new last year at 78k  sold for 85 haha,btohqsg
once my hks come  the j's taking out,btohqsg
Shld keep it. Since your inspection still able to pass with that js,btohqsg
if you see the condition of my j's you will know,btohqsg
if skyrex can't fix  no one can la lol,btohqsg
I know. u send before in the chat,btohqsg
that time still managed to weld  now can't even weld.  Cracks few mins after welding,btohqsg
1 time fine half a drift raching exhaust,btohqsg
but lucky that day go inspection even with crack i pass,btohqsg
With crack they will pass. But u will feel the lack,btohqsg

Hahah. Thats the value of js,btohqsg

Hks doesnt sound as nice as js to be frank.,btohqsg
coe cars left 3 years can sell for profit ?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not a car seller  I just sold cause I wfh and hardly use it,btohqsg
Depend on what depre u boight at. And what depre the market are asking for now.,btohqsg
i think i bought 2010 civic at 36800/5 is 7300 dep,btohqsg
example i bought at 10.8k depre  euro r now can go for 13k depre.  So if i sell now i make a profit.  But i won't know what to change to next.  Because next car also damn high,btohqsg
you win if you got 2nd car or decide to take public transport,btohqsg
Hahaha once I sell I never buy alr,btohqsg
