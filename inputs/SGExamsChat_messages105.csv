Yale nus that one is special case,btohqsg
It's a real incentive that disadvantages the people who dont choose a certain path,btohqsg
The 7.4k student was an exception,btohqsg
the sample size damn small too,btohqsg
Cs students who go faang earn >10k,btohqsg
Is it the yale nus number was screwed due tot he small sample size haha,btohqsg
Also go for high paying careers,btohqsg
I got abit confused  at the high figure,btohqsg
less than 10 graduate i think,btohqsg
Ya that 1 person fked it up,btohqsg
Since when sci grads pay so high,btohqsg
im guessing probably a MCS grad w/ a tech job,btohqsg
damn i hope tech salaries survive by the time i graduate,btohqsg
WOW U ARE ONE OF THOSE WHO PURSUING MONEY OVER PASSION!!!,btohqsg
last i went to jpmorgan talk,btohqsg
faang wont cross 10k as fresh grad in sg,btohqsg
wait ur 10k is USD or SGD,btohqsg
damn that's still fucking insane wtf,btohqsg
Usd if u are in sv,btohqsg
Ask him again on his vacation to his private island in 10 years,btohqsg
sv is at 190 usd annual,btohqsg
Not if i get my own private island first :D,btohqsg
Their cost of living is really high though,btohqsg
how do they earn that much money to pay their tech guys so much,btohqsg
Huh  tech firms always earn a shit ton,btohqsg
wait 190k includes equity or just salary only,btohqsg
1 room rent is 4k a month,btohqsg
are their revenues really that high to pay such high salaries,btohqsg
u want real cash u go finance,btohqsg
u want chill life but ok pay go faang,btohqsg
Yeah if you work daily haha,btohqsg
u invest with ur own cash in high finance,btohqsg
but irr is 20 plus %,btohqsg
I mean software engineer in grab,btohqsg
u double ur money in 4 years in high finance,btohqsg
Actually my mum put 200k into some stocks during covid,btohqsg
Guess u guys gonna be the top 15% in society,btohqsg
I will retire into the next 15% instead,btohqsg
plus u have 0 control over stocks,btohqsg
"Yeah but the ""upside"" is based on covid recovery",btohqsg
private equity u put in own money but u control the biz,btohqsg
20+ March swept into the market. Already made like almost $100k on paper,btohqsg
she will meet her demise very quickly with leverage,btohqsg
Equities seem to have almost recovered to their pre-covid days,btohqsg
this recession not counted cos we have 0 income,btohqsg
Like she plans to grow 200k to 400k then buy a small apartment and rent out,btohqsg
tell her if she want do RE,btohqsg
then nothing to worry le ma,btohqsg
reit yields are at 12% for the past 20 years,btohqsg
best is just throw into some reit etf,btohqsg
USA blue chip stocks also very steady but not sure what direction it is headed to with trade wars,btohqsg
the fees for overseas investing tho,btohqsg
lol i just realise ur name is plank constant,btohqsg
Some condos alr come with tenant so it is a lucrative investment idea I'm impressed,btohqsg
Like you buy over the condo with a tenant contract there,btohqsg
then they can mark up the asking price ma,btohqsg
If you downpay 400k  you loan 100k+ from the bank. Then each month pay a few hundred to the bank and collect rental of $1.8-2k,btohqsg
im still deciding whther do traditional pe,btohqsg
Yup is a good idea  hehe love it,btohqsg
can do repe if u like,btohqsg
What's that sorry I'm not an adult or expert lol,btohqsg
buy property with leverage and payy off debt using cashflow,btohqsg
then sell off when the proprty appreciate in value,btohqsg
its been around for 30 years hahaha,btohqsg
need high amounts of leverage tho,btohqsg
if private property then u better have some good rep,btohqsg
else no one lend u money,btohqsg
That's why they say the rich always get richer,btohqsg
siao liao everyone else siam le,btohqsg
Like during recession can sweep in and buy all the shares,btohqsg
Singtel trade volume very large. Seems like many people sweeping in,btohqsg
thats why they say QE benefits the rich more than the poor,btohqsg
in the end the poor ppl still shitting their pants,btohqsg
though looks like stock indices look quite good,btohqsg
Hahaa is that some H2 econs term,btohqsg
eh its some fiscal policy term,btohqsg
Sg stock  market did not crash much is due to QE?,btohqsg
Its only a small dip  but highly predictable to rebound strongly,btohqsg
qe from america flowing to sg,btohqsg
so long the world is anchored to USD,btohqsg
thats why u see 08 crisis,btohqsg
they print money but hyperinflation didnt happen,btohqsg
i still dont understand this tbh,btohqsg
Does that mean there is covid 19 + great depression in 2020,btohqsg
eh if u print money means theres more money in the market. so money is worth less le,btohqsg
i get the idea of inflation,btohqsg
i just don't understand why QE didn't lead to MORE inflation,btohqsg
cos the world is still pegged to usd,btohqsg
we dilute the effect for them,btohqsg
so rather than us inflation it's global inflation?,btohqsg
you got a writeup that goes into that in more detail,btohqsg
But it's like general knowledge ah,btohqsg
then this is a sibei funny video,btohqsg
today got interview quite shag now,btohqsg
eh i went to watch some video online then happen to pick up knowledge,btohqsg
:X the vibes i getting from this video are oof alr,btohqsg
im wary of getting info from these types of sources HAHAHA,btohqsg
In b4 kenna pofma by pm lee,btohqsg
oh god i need to google half of these words,btohqsg
He speak Chinese damn fast too lol,btohqsg
Does people in China speak this quickly too,btohqsg
i mean issa their native language,btohqsg
Wah watch these videos confirm can improve Chinese lol,btohqsg
this guy video used in classrooms btw,btohqsg
Lol he used the key and peele drop the soap scene,btohqsg
hey  sorry@smellyomelette  we don't allow people to advertise surveys here :) if you wanna advertise ur survey you can do so at the survey section in our discord!,btohqsg
i'll help u send 1 response though HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Thanks man  so sorry about that,btohqsg
i kenna banned by discord le,btohqsg
i say something like median population in singapore can afford to pay off student debt in 2-3 years,btohqsg
but some guy to the left of the bell curve kb me,btohqsg
is this on our discord server lol,btohqsg
then i emphasized is median population,btohqsg
man you can be correct in your argument but i was reading the discussion as it was unfurling in the chat,btohqsg
well  im sure that wasn't the reason why you're banned. our mod logs are public  and our mods do not ban anyone unless there was a legit reason to do so,btohqsg
maybe your argument no problem but you weren't exactly arguing in a very rational/non-confrontational way either,btohqsg
just cos i from cambridge i shit on other ppl,btohqsg
all these kinds of thing lor,btohqsg
u can go read the chat if u like la,btohqsg
Maybe they think that you are too elite for them to handle,btohqsg
if a community of people feel that your behaviour is not acceptable  maybe there is an issue with the behaviour you were showing in that chat,btohqsg
i mean if they muted on discord i trust their judgment,btohqsg
"rather than ""a community"" i feel is a few specific ppl",btohqsg
since its this particular guy who 卖惨and take offense,btohqsg
i mean at the end of the day i can't stop you from feeling like you were wronged by the discord mods but i have to say that i respect them and i think if they muted their reasons were legitimate la,btohqsg
but maybe the reason for muting wasn't communicated clearly,btohqsg
I think the tele mods trying not to judge the discord mod judgement then later undermine discord mod role lol,btohqsg
"the mod thinks ""just cos im from cambridge goesnt give me a free pass to shit at other peoples jobs""",btohqsg
i'm in the discord  i interact w the discord mods,btohqsg
i mean ya there's that element but i genuinely respect them and think that they are good mods,btohqsg
use that argument hard to rebut sia,btohqsg
i mean sg has reserves and isn't printing money la so,btohqsg
What if become PE teacher ah,btohqsg
actually pe teacher quite shiok leh,btohqsg
it is  and one of the worst paid,btohqsg
then just tell people go play game,btohqsg
Pay is dependent on qualifications and rank,btohqsg
Idt is on what sub u teach,btohqsg
honestly i havent seen alot of people aspiring to be teachers,btohqsg
PE teachers dont need mark homework,btohqsg
no need do much admin work,btohqsg
If you have masters then higher salary ah,btohqsg
Yea civil service all like that one,btohqsg
I thought PE teacher same pay as other subject teacher,btohqsg
teachers one of the shagest shit in china,btohqsg
Ull most likely teach a sub subject also,btohqsg
U cannot just be a PE teacher,btohqsg
Jc pe teachers beo xmm nia,btohqsg
I got one PE teacher whose also PW teacher,btohqsg
My JC all pe teachers except head got teach another subject or handle admin issues,btohqsg
Jc PE teacher maybe need to control pants during lesson,btohqsg
sg also tbh  but better paid,btohqsg
China alot of teachers stay in school de,btohqsg
And their hours are like 8-10,btohqsg
I know in china their class size have like 80students one,btohqsg
Their gaokao revision sibei siao on de,btohqsg
Singapore usually 40  if not 20-30,btohqsg
I just saying most jcs pe teacher dont teach other sub,btohqsg
My PE teacher taught me maths,btohqsg
Or is it the other way round,btohqsg
SG alevels honestly less stress than gaokao,btohqsg
No wonder I see some of my foreign secondary classmates come Singapore to escape gaokao,btohqsg
How to run faster using math ah,btohqsg
My sec sch math teacher was a pe teacher,btohqsg
I use to have a teacher that teach us the math of sports,btohqsg
PE and maths is a weird combo,btohqsg
ya lor  plus no bell curve at a lvls,btohqsg
Like how to throw furthest how to run faster   the angle and all,btohqsg
Ya sia thinking back a lvl really less stress than uni,btohqsg
Uni every exam need fight bell curve,btohqsg
Gaokao has a sibei huge impact on their lives de,btohqsg
My PE teacher was my cca TIC + coach + pw teacher + gp teacher,btohqsg
u can slack the first 20 months,btohqsg
and chiong the last 2 for straight As,btohqsg
Cosno matter how old u are u are judged by ur bachelor uni,btohqsg
Not by ur PhD or masters shit,btohqsg
Tbh tho if jc is not so stressed then how about poly lol,btohqsg
not my class directly but she came in to help,btohqsg
In fact first time i heard pe teachers teach other sub in jc(excl pw),btohqsg
I'm from poly I can vouch for poly,btohqsg
You self study the jc and poly and countless exams lol,btohqsg
Maybe you are teen prodigy @kmy,btohqsg
Ok la maybe for jc eligible ppl go poly is quite chill,btohqsg
I've time to do alevel alongside poly sio,btohqsg
i would have went ej if i was born later :(,btohqsg
You also have time to do other exams sia,btohqsg
Ya la and all other random exams,btohqsg
Poly time best time of my life,btohqsg
Honestly scoring 3.8 isn't harder than scoring four As,btohqsg
Tbh securing cs spot in local uni must be one of the most difficult achievement in Singapore academic Olympics,btohqsg
i would say med/dent is the toughest,btohqsg
Huh where u throw law and med to,btohqsg
Many cs students will be proud,btohqsg
I got a major first world problem,btohqsg
What K drama has little romance?,btohqsg
He said 1 of the most difficult not the most,btohqsg
It’s just the heavy flow of the current topic,btohqsg

Can re ask at a quieter time,btohqsg
Hm tc quite hard to get,btohqsg
Zzzz I wake up at 12,btohqsg

Cuz I also have interest in studying law,btohqsg
Lsat is one of the hardest exams I have taken btw,btohqsg
Law school is post graduate in USA ah,btohqsg

Why I want to prove sia,btohqsg
I know of one other person who lied on linkedin,btohqsg

but once some1 finds out  gone fk,btohqsg
Mr 1hr MOT why never help the chem student in the stufy group asking MOT ques,btohqsg

Copy paste from a post inside the group,btohqsg
How come sgexams portal don't have math notes lol,btohqsg
It's hard to make notes for math,btohqsg
Compared to other more content based subjects,btohqsg

All our notes is John Smith,btohqsg

The most valuable part will probably the PYPs,btohqsg
What's the difference after that lol,btohqsg
Love  passion  wisdom  knowledge  personal growth,btohqsg
Ok lor then how u wanna talk about it,btohqsg
I prefer to talk about love,btohqsg
Lol you too excited to keep it in the pants?,btohqsg

Passion wisdom knowledge love all up there in the hierarchy of needs,btohqsg
Never fulfill lower level talk about passion,btohqsg
Notwithstanding those who are ok with dying for their religion,btohqsg
How you know you achieved all these lol,btohqsg
Most of us in affluent sg are fine come on,btohqsg
Most ppl rly lookin for the money,btohqsg
Only some boomers get the main part of the wealth,btohqsg
“Let’s stray away from God” -Jay,btohqsg
Average income 6k. Just spend money wisely ur good bro,btohqsg
"""Oh i wanna go cs/banking instead"" aft i grad",btohqsg
LOL since when i said that,btohqsg
Then why talk about mean sia,btohqsg

ah see i told u it will start again thanks to a few ppl,btohqsg
Then increase for no reason liao,btohqsg
The more or them there are  the more disappointment there will be.I already stopped trying to say that there will be disappointment because honestly what can you replace their greed for money with,btohqsg
Greed for money is evil la,btohqsg
Its a typical jay tan dynkin combo,btohqsg
Law can earn a lot of money too,btohqsg
Is how this society shapes success to be,btohqsg
But very hard to get the good jobs,btohqsg
if you guys want to go talk about salary,btohqsg
Audit Associate start at 3k lol,btohqsg
I not bad i just tired thus blunt haha,btohqsg
Whatever you think it is  it exists in people's hearts and you can't just take it away. Even if you succeed  without proper replacement it's not a good outcome for them,btohqsg
Hm anyone thought how productivity is created?,btohqsg
unless singapore's gonna start giving salary to students  i don't see a point about arguing about salary here,btohqsg
But this is r/sg cuz it got driven away from r/sg/s,btohqsg
More impt is me packing my bags,btohqsg
h /by right most important is happiness lol,btohqsg
And potential failing of law exam,btohqsg
Either way when we talk about money it's not really always only about individual income,btohqsg
It's about the distribution of societal resources,btohqsg
Nobody interested in distributive justice meh,btohqsg
U want lie u going for uni law arh,btohqsg
I wanted to play for a while,btohqsg
Honestly I have no idea why people study law,btohqsg
Me neither  prob cos for the *ahem*,btohqsg
If we don't think about market,btohqsg
just like all other degree resources,btohqsg
Yeah y do judges even exist,btohqsg
NUS law actually still ok  is SMU/SUSS actually,btohqsg
I prefer studying laws of nature  easier and I think there's some fairness in it,btohqsg
Imagine sending this to a public chat,btohqsg
This ques has already been asked before -rep,btohqsg
You know  any sarcastic response to this can result in litigation so I guess this is litigation bait now,btohqsg
U sleep with ppl in the same room for 2 years in army,btohqsg
I also want to stay out,btohqsg
lol just cuz soemone is gay or bi doesnt mean they'll like u,btohqsg
Right  i read the followup msgs lol thought it was gonna be some clown stuff,btohqsg
I don't think it's the worst thing he ever said,btohqsg
Ok la but no matter what just like meritocracy  society cant have equal and fair distribution of resources,btohqsg
Evidently it got ignored for the most part,btohqsg
Yah as compared to some of dynkin stuff,btohqsg
Thats why it will nvr be something that can be solved in the near future  and years to come.,btohqsg
Given a veil of ignorance of ur own destiny  how would u distribute resources of the world,btohqsg
