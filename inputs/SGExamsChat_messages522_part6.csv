Took a few gap years lor but then again boys got the disadvantage of ns,btohqsg
I got a y1 student 27,btohqsg
even tried to submit hw on 12am then claim that the website down,btohqsg
its more of just happy than proud,btohqsg
because ITE dont even allow the kind of freedom RP has,btohqsg
If its 12am I'll just send via teams or email,btohqsg
yeah sia she legit said she clicked submit for rj on 2359 then kena say over alreadythen guess whatshe blamed the fucking lecturer,btohqsg
Say something stupid like my Internet down or smth,btohqsg
Rp legit in terms of education restrictions/boundaries is one of the most chillax poly's,btohqsg
say it's the lecturers fault she didnt submit work on time,btohqsg
likely its a attitude she brought over from ite,btohqsg
but her words will fall on deaf years,btohqsg
cause unlike ITE...the lecturers in poly dont really care,btohqsg
wah lian my english is so bad siano wonder C6 ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
see that's what I'm saying dude,btohqsg
especially RP  cause most are part timers,btohqsg
ITE is more controlled like legit but then again the rules violation of ITE is more severe and they usually punish more less strictly for ITE,btohqsg
most rp lecturers got a 2nd job,btohqsg
Most RP lecturers are part time.. in fact most lecturers in general are part time,btohqsg
U see the associate beside their name it means part time liao,btohqsg
marking...etc mostly done by online system,btohqsg
wonder what he's doing nowprobably being a pedo on other apps,btohqsg
they dont mark anything individually...test or exams,btohqsg
The team and inv assignments they do,btohqsg
It's only the LEO quiz cluster quiz then no,btohqsg
is every poly lecturer like rp lecturers,btohqsg
i mean..yea but they mark it when they better off letting some ai mark,btohqsg
Like if u do it in leo then its the system that marks it,btohqsg
cause their remarks legit copy and paste,btohqsg
i hate rp for many good reasons,btohqsg
i was in rp goddamn you dont know how awful it is,btohqsg
Most RJs in SAS are actually non content based so they don't rlly have weightage,btohqsg
at first it was fine but they legit start showing their true color already,btohqsg
I once drew ASCII art for my RJ got level 4 for that component,btohqsg
"yea keep asking ""so what is the hardest component""",btohqsg
"or ""What do you plan to do differently""",btohqsg
then the lecturers dgaf alsocomplained to my program chair and mentor evenall don't care one,btohqsg
If anyone was asking it was pepe the frog looking disappointed,btohqsg
