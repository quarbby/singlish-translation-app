I dunno can you prove to the level beyond a reasonable doubt?,btohqsg
I can prove it by removing the name censor,btohqsg
Well by doctoring the proof that piece of evidence had broken the chain of custody and I move to have it striken as an inadmissible piece of evidence,btohqsg
Furthermore under Rule 403 of the Rules of Evidence  the defense contends that the probative value of the material is heavily outweighed by the potential prejudicial value for the referenced material.,btohqsg
