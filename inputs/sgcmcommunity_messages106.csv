My bro wants to respray Honda Fit  asking y‚Äôall roughly how much,btohqsg
And same color or diff color,btohqsg
Same color iirc abt 1.5k ish ish,btohqsg
Wrap 1.6k and can change color,btohqsg
5k is really spray whole car diff color int and ext alr,btohqsg
My first thought of wrap was cling wrap üòÇ,btohqsg
If u want retain original paintwork  wrap is the way to go,btohqsg
Then wrap dun need do ceramic coating liao HAHAH,btohqsg
Shorter downtime also. But find reputable workshop to wrap,btohqsg
Wrap 3 to 5 days gaodim,btohqsg
He wants to change from black to white üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
Wa TOLONG LAH DONT LAH!!! White car need ceramic coating if respray,btohqsg
Ask him wrap hot red lah!!!! üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Eh what.. red car nothing wrong hor!,btohqsg
Red is Sweet colour for sure,btohqsg
Wa bro u know some ppl mod the fit until,btohqsg
I wonder how it would sound in cabin actually. Drone won‚Äôt be driving one mad meh?,btohqsg
Best a avoid shell. Y go around  not that free,btohqsg
Bro the pumps not even 1 minute apart,btohqsg
Only it it contacts your car seat.,btohqsg
Their vpower racing only 1.60 per litre but still complaining ah üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
What if hang on the rear view mirror,btohqsg
I need all the power I can,btohqsg
Iw to  reach 90 without the fear of hitting accords,btohqsg
The pumps are literally just in the same station  not asking you to double back like sg expressway missing a exit,btohqsg
Why avoid a whole brand? Petron and PETRONAS can also have the same issue bah,btohqsg
I think you need to use your leg and brakes for that boss,btohqsg
Why not avoid driving. I think it is easier for you to take BusMRTWalk.,btohqsg
Use the $5 spray at hardware shop,btohqsg
Can give me a TLDR of whats gng on w the Msia petrol? Idg the convo flow HAHHAA,btohqsg
If u want spray workshop i also got contact HAHHA,btohqsg
I swear if u go msia and still need niam the petrol price  idt u shud be driving alr. No offense.,btohqsg
Okay I got the gist alr,btohqsg
Thanks bro HAHAH really senior member,btohqsg
Just take whatever you can get from malaysia,btohqsg
Higher grade less than $2 alr still wanna niam. Some of us no time still need pump SG 3 dollars and above alr leh.,btohqsg
Ringgit wont be 1:3 all the way one. We never know the future,btohqsg
not with anwar at the wheel i believe,btohqsg
But going down leh ever since he took over,btohqsg
thats why 1:1 is a fantasy,btohqsg
Go too far down nobody wanna invest liao,btohqsg
can la buy a house retire there,btohqsg
u buy now go to 4.30 means 25% discount,btohqsg
where to find this type of discount nearby,btohqsg
i said nearby coz we are not going sumatra or batam,btohqsg
Means I need to wear underwear liao. No wonder I so slow,btohqsg
Wear plus paint it red. Plus 1000hp,btohqsg
G string style plus 1 500hp and 200% concentration,btohqsg
Now I know what that meant by ‚Äúwhen the cold wind blows‚Äù,btohqsg
with a civic on my back,btohqsg
You can get the d|‚Ç¨kJust call me the ball s@ckI'm nuts,btohqsg
sorry for the late reply!! he gave up the idea le,btohqsg
he needs his car for work and can't just leave it there for 2 days,btohqsg
At the 2nd link there isn't any v power only v racing,btohqsg
Y not. A dollar Dave is a dollar earned.  Don't tell me you pump v racing all the time,btohqsg
I just went there last week,btohqsg
But i believe all of us will be smart enough to look around too if don‚Äôt want v racing,btohqsg
Easier for me.  So far Petronas no such problem. Petron I'll avoid if possible  I got muck at the station  sungai buloh.  Staff and management not helpful at all,btohqsg
And elaborate on your issues with petron and shell,btohqsg
No need to worry about v racing.,btohqsg
Wah finally entertainment in this chat after our most favourite member got kicked,btohqsg
guys my favourite sentence is incoming,btohqsg
Ok but if you just open your eyes a bit  can see the different coloured nozzles and see what to pump,btohqsg
You didn't speak about petron yet,btohqsg
"Getting ""muck"" on yourself can happen anywhere sir....",btohqsg
How dare you point out a good tip and make his life easier,btohqsg
How dare you imply he doesn't know all this,btohqsg
So you dislike petron because you gotmuckonce there,btohqsg
I guess if happen in your doorstep you will not help,btohqsg
How is that anyone else's fault,btohqsg
I guess I enjoyed getting mucked,btohqsg
Next time your car got dust? Will you avoid all roads in Singapore? Because LTA never wash the car for you?,btohqsg
Anyway my money  I decide what to pump,btohqsg
"""avoid shell  avoid petron"" they never clean my muck off my shoes  they never tell me I'm pumping more expensive petrol",btohqsg
Why not buy a car in JB so can pump 95 then transfer to your car,btohqsg
Hope the PETRONAS guys come and clean your shoes  feed you grapes and fill the right petrol in for you,btohqsg
Seems like that's what you want at a petrol station in a different country where you're availing the cheaper price anyway,btohqsg
Need korkor protect you while you pump petrol?,btohqsg
No need.  Hope you get it one day,btohqsg
Good luck go the area that I‚Äôll getmuck,btohqsg
i wud go with u or serene or shane or the regulars here only,btohqsg
Save you from pumping Ron 100 or vpower racing,btohqsg
And make sure you pump 97 instead of 100,btohqsg
And then if your minimum grade 98  your engine start knocking,btohqsg
Mr Cross is cross with the staff at Petron as they didn't clean his shoes for him,btohqsg
but honestly bro  as long as u go malaysia  just pump the petrol u want. dc what brand what price or service. ultimately  don't forget the main goal u are there. to pump petrol.,btohqsg
Yup I just saying I will avoid shell solely becos of v racing,btohqsg
Scared of v racing is it,btohqsg
Or to drive and have fun,btohqsg
Petrol can be a byproduct on the way back!,btohqsg
97 Vs v racing price difference is just too much,btohqsg
All you have to do is,btohqsg
V powered racing is a bright red,btohqsg
If you cannot make the colour difference out,btohqsg
How do you differentiate between amber and red traffic lights sir?,btohqsg
Sir can I have your carplate,btohqsg
I would like to use it on my vehicle,btohqsg
I think you have free pass from LTA,btohqsg
aiya  v racing. after conversion still 1.71 per litre.. if its at 5.05RM.. still cheap. once in awhile pump wrong issokay,btohqsg
i wud take it as an opportunity to see which fuel grade is good,btohqsg
eg compare power  fuel economy all these,btohqsg
with an exchange rate of 1:3.2,btohqsg
1.71 which is still cheaper than 98 in SG,btohqsg
So mean.. I feel excluded now üò¢üò¢,btohqsg
Wait!!!! ARE WE FROM THE SAME VILLAGE!!??,btohqsg
I a bit confused sir‚Ä¶ why you avoid shell because they sell premium fuel v racing? You can pump their lower grades mah? So easy. All colour coded and all.,btohqsg
Actually  what car are you driving sir?,btohqsg
Wa bro ultimately im still a Singaporean siaaaaa  born and bred,btohqsg
car is irrelevant... brain is pretty crucial,btohqsg
is like me blacklisting mcdonald's because they sell filet o fish and i don't eat fish,btohqsg
Or I shun Singapore Airlines because they have First Class seats and I don‚Äôt want to pay money for First Class ticket.,btohqsg
What if I accidentally click to buy First Class ticket then how?,btohqsg
I Indian Villager but you and I also same same dei. Both citizens of this wonderful üåç (and SGCM Community)!,btohqsg
I wanna be so rich that I didn‚Äôt even realise I accidentally bought first class tickets,btohqsg
I chinese lah! üòÇüòÇ but this is Singapore where Singlish rules the land HAAHHA,btohqsg
I wanna be so rich that I didn‚Äôt even realise I accidentally bought v racing,btohqsg
I wanna be rich and just go airport find a random counter and ask  u got seats?,btohqsg
I wanna be rich and just go kopitiam find a random stall and ask  u got food?,btohqsg
Now I need to be careful which coffee shop I go to‚Ä¶ I only go those that sell $0.90 kopi o,btohqsg
Oh. Nvm nvm important is we are both automotive lovers!!!!! AUTOMOTIVE BRUDDERS!!!!,btohqsg
My fav is even $0 70 only for kopi o,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I said automotive sir.. I only have rickshaw! But one day k? I will grow up and be able to own my first car sir.,btohqsg
But not sure if I should share with you leh‚Ä¶ sekali you drive all the way there and accidentally order more expensive coffee drink then how?? Or order coke instead of coffee??,btohqsg
@HistoryofManok lah it's new year and sharing is caring! It's at taman jurong food centre near my dorm at joo koon.  Nam Hong coffee stall.  Go check it out!!!! Solid coffee ‚ò∫,btohqsg
My house here Kopi i think 1.10 onwards alr,btohqsg
Dk gst 8% they got up again anot,btohqsg
Go take a look  shell 2nd link whether got 97 or normal v power,btohqsg
vpower is literally the same as 97 with additives,btohqsg
vpower racing is the higher gradae,btohqsg
Got both 97 and vpower racing,btohqsg
My guy I was just there 2 weeks ago,btohqsg
Both my sisters ride and they pumped v power/97,btohqsg
Not really an L lah since it‚Äôs still cheap,btohqsg
Not exactly sure  they market it as better than 97 but certainly not as good as 100,btohqsg
Dono how true 100 is their 100 oso ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Sometimes we just gotta placebo effect ourselves,btohqsg
Eh his one is legit hor üòâ I‚Äôm referring to those add M  N  R or S sticker one (did I cover all of them?),btohqsg
When some corp come up with some s* to f* you up  just avoid it. Y pay for their bonuses,btohqsg
Erm .. how about Apple products?,btohqsg
Bro  every business gotta make a profit. If no one makes a profit  its called communismüòÖ,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt go MacDonald‚Äôs. they came up with Nasi Lemak burger to___(pls fill in the blank),btohqsg
Idk it's still better than the ebi one,btohqsg
My 1st breakdown after 9 years... battery ran flat  good thing for me  I always have my emergency battery starter with me. 1st use also... 1st day of 2023...üò≥üò≥üò≥,btohqsg
What about apple product.  You have a choice. I dont at shell 2nd link,btohqsg
U didnt change battery for 9 years?!,btohqsg
What kind of sorcery is this,btohqsg
2nd battery  1st was routine maintenance change at year 6 of owning VW... average battery lasts 5 years,btohqsg
Idk what battery u have been using  but i change every 2 years ish or even 1 yr ishüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Maybe cus my in car cam is 24/7 so drain faster,btohqsg
Hais no need disturb me leh,btohqsg
You have the choice to look around in the station for 97,btohqsg
Yea  my car is about 100k mileage now... 9.5 years,btohqsg
Shortest Battery life was on Renault  7months. Wearnes gave me a new battery when they came to tow the carüò¢üò¢üòäüòä,btohqsg
how much was it mine need change every slight short of 2 years,btohqsg
that explain . mine only 1xxüòÇ,btohqsg
These batteries usually has a 5 years warranty,btohqsg
For batteries  need to have high cranking cycle  not only voltage and Amperes,btohqsg
i changed for my 116d before,btohqsg
Cranking cycle is important for auto start stop cars,btohqsg
Wa 450 for a battery really damn hard to swallow,btohqsg
I guess you get for what you pay,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm happy with my 100 battery,btohqsg
But urs 9000rpm wad.. that‚Äôs true üòÅ,btohqsg
I mean his one 5 years average each gear is 90 dollars,btohqsg
Mine is 128 average 2.5 years,btohqsg
One year abt 51 lo but his is just dont need freq change,btohqsg
Time wasted = opportunity cost for other stuff,btohqsg
Recently encountered a car going 70 on a 90 in the first lane :),btohqsg
I‚Äôve seen a car pull into lane 1 at 60 knowing cars are coming at 90.,btohqsg
And have had cars drive at 30 on an expressway without traffic in lane 2. So‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Are you sure they weren't pushing?,btohqsg
Nope. Probably a flint stone car though,btohqsg
Lmao such ppl who get rear ended deserved wtv is coming to them,btohqsg
As a car guy  I‚Äôm not worried about him. I‚Äôm worried about the guy behind me who can‚Äôt stop in time‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Whenever I've jammed by brakes because someone langgar in front on the highway,btohqsg
I've always been more worried about the guy behind,btohqsg
I try to avoid this and lane change if it‚Äôs empty,btohqsg
That split second stare into your mirror to see if he's slowing down or not,btohqsg
Always check the lane before this.,btohqsg
Sadly everytime I've had to jam I've done so when there's a fair amount of traffic,btohqsg
7/10 times you can swing out safely,btohqsg
My Blindspot big  bikes are not nice,btohqsg
Don't want to kill a man,btohqsg
And the 3 times I've done it,btohqsg
Somehow always had an altis right next to me,btohqsg
Just as we talking abt idiots who change lane jn  an old man decided to change as im approaching,btohqsg
Horn him and he still changed to my lane,btohqsg
Wait‚Ä¶ someone saw me with my rickshaw??!!,btohqsg
