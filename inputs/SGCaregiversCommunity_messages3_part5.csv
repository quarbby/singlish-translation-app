Interesting insights into how caregivers affect us developmentally across ages,btohqsg
Basically  we need to take a developmental approach to life la. At X stage e.g. middle age 40-60  there is a certain developmetal milestone then how u manage with competing goals. It is definitely doable if you have a strong ecosystem support. Problem comes when one try to tank and do everything alone,btohqsg
even for young children  there are some things that still can be done like small household chores. In some case  it build resiliency and empathy skills compared to folks who have no experience caring for others. But the baseline is caregiving is pretty much in the human nature and its social experienced. It as old as humanity as it was.. the only difference now is the structural and systemic issues like how work/school is separated from home life,btohqsg
Hi all  like to help a caregiver check if there is a pre-loved wheelchair that she can collect for her mother. If you have one or know of one  please do PM me. Thanks!,btohqsg
