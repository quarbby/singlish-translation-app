I tried to run away from my fears in life and its exactly what I'm about to turn into,btohqsg
heart rate was so high to the point he nearly had a seizure,btohqsg
it went to 164 in an instant,btohqsg
plus the other ambulance went for the call posted to our firestation right after us,btohqsg
went to a 3month baby who got a small part of his/her finger,btohqsg
it scared the shit outta me bro,btohqsg
idk the temperature but probably like 39,btohqsg
my shift ended like 15min late,btohqsg
but then i handed over to night crew alr q quickly,btohqsg
BRO NEARLY ALL 6 AMBULANCES IN THE STATION GOT TURNOUT,btohqsg
like i saw 1 i was like hi,btohqsg
then a 3rd one like right after,btohqsg
and like the 4th one i saw ready to exit station,btohqsg
i check the place where all ambulances are and like all of them gone,btohqsg
lucky is just q a few calls at the same time,btohqsg
now i don feel well lmao,btohqsg
I'm 20  how long more can I hide away from what's going on?,btohqsg
U do realise these ppl are damn old here,btohqsg
in case any young people interested,btohqsg
Will still lose $ to inflation of 5.5%,btohqsg
but not easy to beat 5.5%,btohqsg
I will probably try for 10k,btohqsg
Yeah  I'm one of them too  aren't I  kid?,btohqsg
allocate different parts of your networth to different instruments.,btohqsg
SSB is good for parking semi-emergency funds,btohqsg
btw white tree frog is 130 blue phase is 230,btohqsg
TBill yield up  ssb 10 year SGS curve probably gonna be up  so next issue probably 3.++,btohqsg
next issue put in another tranche,btohqsg
I been bond laddering my house funds into SSB anyway (not that it’s a lot),btohqsg
Commitment period quite long  can’t get my money out if I wanna make a good buy let’s say some sort of market crash or housing impulse choice,btohqsg
Although to be fair SSB also 1 month not say super responsive but better than 6m 1y or longer,btohqsg
Half equities half SSB  interest pay my insurance premiums and income tax  live 10% income. Buy condo  go gym  get FU money  do what I want  get old  downgrade condo  save for premium old folks home,btohqsg
Appreciation better and I like the convenience esp if you buy one close to MRT or near a mall,btohqsg
Got chance for Enbloc - free money,btohqsg
just go malaysia stay in one of their abandoned buildings  dont need condo,btohqsg
Malaysia quality of life not as good,btohqsg
alot of new lines coming up,btohqsg
alot of new stations..getting sprung up,btohqsg
You can keep it for 10 years but SSB can sell any time get principal back 1 month,btohqsg
If you sell at the end of the month the closing window may be as fast as 4/3 days,btohqsg
Which is when you can play timing the market (housing or stock),btohqsg
FD you beg and cry also the money won’t come back,btohqsg
Optionality to me is worth more than the extra 100 interest a year on 10k,btohqsg
SSb interesting feature is the bi-annual interest,btohqsg
So if you “ladder” which means you buy monthly tranches  you get a stream of money deposited into your account,btohqsg
Which you can use to pay bills,btohqsg
But ofc FD is better overall return so if you don’t plan to do anything FD better,btohqsg
If you have a steam of interest monthly which matches/pays for recurring bills. you can accrue better interest rates on the money.Because you don’t need to leave money in your account collecting lousy interest  I think it’s not a bad choice all things considered.Feels good to me anyway. When I add all the factors up  ease of purchase redemption  optionality  frequency of interest  risk  flexibility  I like it better than FD.,btohqsg
I found YAKUN in KLIA lol,btohqsg
Same price in Ringgit maybe equivalent in SGD,btohqsg
