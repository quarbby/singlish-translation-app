But i doubt that is very possible also,btohqsg
Cus the thing is you still need to have a psychiatrist letter to prove you have the illness,btohqsg
A person with depression will be stuck at a pes C.,btohqsg
so far iâ€™m quite looking forward to it eh,btohqsg
feel like i should make the most of it,btohqsg
Mmm diff people with diff vocations experience diff things,btohqsg
I think if someone experienced hallucinations before due to mental  issues shouldn't be in ns ofc,btohqsg
Ah there is also one more interesting part to this,btohqsg
That one poses a threat to others,btohqsg
So there is also pes F,btohqsg
But typically pes F is given as an option,btohqsg
For ppl who cannot serve at all ?,btohqsg
The problem i find with this stems from parents,btohqsg
There are parents who wld convince their child to enter ns,btohqsg
Because of the belief that pes f will affect their outcomes outside ns,btohqsg
I say this for real  i have seen a person who is mentally impaired but somehow in ns(he had an option to pes f). But because of his reluctance to do anything  the superiors just straight up gave up on him,btohqsg
So basically all he did throughout ns was just sit on a chair. And sleep.,btohqsg
Like send their kid for ns,btohqsg
End up we had an nsf doing his job and his own job ðŸ˜ª,btohqsg
Ok but to each his own uh,btohqsg
To some NS was fun for them,btohqsg
"wait for the CO to say...""NS is a privilege""",btohqsg
Actually I was wondering about sth funny as a joke somehow  what if ns man is not competent in his post ?,btohqsg
Like e.g. crash his fighter jet due to incompetence ?,btohqsg
peace time no issuewar time can die first,btohqsg
That is where DB comes in,btohqsg
Idk somehow one of the ADF regular told me it was ok(?),btohqsg
Ahh I see ppl in USA crashing their fighter planes before  fortunately most are due to system failure,btohqsg
I have seen a Pes B NS scholar get nervous because he shoot early,btohqsg
I sometimes wonder how he is now but I kinda felt bad for him,btohqsg
I can't tell. I never really knew much abt the airforce ones,btohqsg
The military investigation branch all convinced he shouldn't be dismissed,btohqsg
I only know that SK accidently bombed US a few hrs ago.,btohqsg
I tot they like hit a village a week ago or smth,btohqsg
Idk i saw the news just yesterday lmao,btohqsg
Oh like 2 days ago lol,btohqsg
at least not north korea thank god,btohqsg
Well USA dun have like national service at the moment but they used to have uh,btohqsg
During times of war they have conscription of sorts,btohqsg
"i think they were this close to almost having an ""NS""",btohqsg
I was actually thinking if US need conscription too ....,btohqsg
i have thought abt this qn before,btohqsg
Like if US start conscription   ppl who want to exploit their birthright citizenship law would think twice before doing so ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
As their children could get drafted into military for equivalent of our ns,btohqsg
I have a friend who is born in US but he gave up his US citizenship years ago to get his SG citizenship,btohqsg
if having a level during covid pandemic?,btohqsg
As a nerd in JC myself  I wld still find it peaceful,btohqsg
I have friends but honestly I am just an introvert,btohqsg
I mean at most social media wise uh  wld be quite helpful,btohqsg
I wld not be questioning myself why everyone is partying during A levels,btohqsg
