Climate activists in western countries pour paints on buildings and paintings?,btohqsg
i would like to not compare between countries and separate regions as a whole,btohqsg
i used to think western referred to americans & europeans but nah it's mainly the states since europeans died down a lot after the monarchy reigns had been exposed for their dirty linen,btohqsg
"i mean where are "" the states ... for their dirty linen"" ?",btohqsg
PUA is short for the term  pick-up artist which means being deceived  manipulated or brainwashed,btohqsg
there should be a comma or a period (full stop) between those two lines,btohqsg
...it's mainly the states. since europeans died down a lot after the monarchy reigns had been exposed for dirty linen,btohqsg
i mean  such stuff existed but wasn't publicized until social media's emergence,btohqsg
