silver ztune is full concert gtt,btohqsg
ONG LAI PLS CHAIN THE YEAR 2 TWENTY FAI EARS,btohqsg
I think I’ve seen that one,btohqsg
Hopefully some day I can afford a second car on classic plate LOL,btohqsg
not a can but a will,btohqsg
the money goes where the mind wanders,btohqsg
but importing a classic in is a very hefty thing,btohqsg
was quoted 120k+ to import the Cossie in lol.,btohqsg
market value + 100% tax + GST + 10% COE,btohqsg
There’s still that 100% tax on classics?,btohqsg
So an nsx is about 100k sgd,btohqsg
the 100% tax iirc is for vehicles,btohqsg
Total cost to get one is 250ish?,btohqsg
heard the countach was north of 3 mil,btohqsg
a price of a r35 sia,btohqsg
And can only drive 40+ days,btohqsg
but can a cayman get that much hype?,btohqsg
If u ok w this it’s 40k ah,btohqsg
i thought that was kunimitsu livery for a sec,btohqsg
Probably beat to hell n back,btohqsg
Add on the tax n shit,btohqsg
isit tht time tht went to dempsey?,btohqsg
iirc myfriend spent 60k+ on his corolla,btohqsg
My quick google was in the 80k usd range,btohqsg
Maybe let someone else import then buy from them LOL,btohqsg
hais missed sm good opportunity to see these cars,btohqsg
Where do you go to find imports?,btohqsg
"they might have the ""rarity charge""",btohqsg
If I keep my current car,btohqsg
If I live like a peasant in all other aspects LOL,btohqsg
imo if you want a decent classic to keep  can look at Honda City Turbo II,btohqsg
think the price is not bad either,btohqsg
Uh I can send u a spreadsheet ah but it’s mostly1.YahooAuc2. USS Tokyo3. Respect Motors4. Goonet5. Bforward,btohqsg
the turbo ii is a baby baby nsx,btohqsg
There r a lot ah but these are the more reputable-ish ones,btohqsg
If uw cheaper u go Japan hunt,btohqsg
does the nsx come with a motocompo?,btohqsg
buy 1 vehicle get 1 free,btohqsg
If nsx dreams don’t come true then likely I’ll just play the daily driver,btohqsg
And enjoy a 987 or 718 or emira a decade later,btohqsg
what's the daily as of now?,btohqsg
SBS but sometimes I take the SMRT out for a spin,btohqsg
Need to figure out 1m rear fender conversions,btohqsg
Doesn’t seem like an easy job,btohqsg
such a baller. mine's a Mercedes-Benzcitaro,btohqsg
with the power of alcohol anything is possible,btohqsg
Lye doesn’t even do custom kits now,btohqsg
Like they’ll install something for you and make it fit,btohqsg
But they won’t make it from scratch,btohqsg
Maybe I’ll go try lidar scanning an actual 1m,btohqsg
Then ask China if they’ll make it LOL,btohqsg
But the rear fenders are truly a huge job. Not just a swap job like front fenders,btohqsg
Then probably need a 1m bumper and trunk lid idk,btohqsg
im sure they might have some kits for the fenders,btohqsg
Replacing anything breaking with a better version of it,btohqsg
40k for a shitbox?? No thanks…,btohqsg
40k for a nsx is good what,btohqsg

Age and mileage: An older NSX with high mileage may not justify a $40 000 price tag.Maintenance costs: NSX maintenance can be expensive.Fuel efficiency: It's not known for being particularly fuel-efficient.Limited interior space: It's a sports car  so interior space is limited.Potential for repair costs: Some parts can be costly to replace.Lack of modern features: Older models may lack modern tech.Depreciation: It might continue to depreciate in value.Competition: There are newer sports cars at similar prices.Insurance costs: Insurance premiums can be high for sports cars.Rarity: Depending on the model  it may not be particularly rare.Resale value: The resale value may not hold up well.Comfort: Not known for its comfort on long drives.Limited cargo space: Minimal room for luggage or groceries.Ride quality: It can be stiff and not ideal for rough roads.Noise levels: Road noise can be noticeable.Availability: Finding a well-maintained NSX at that price may be challenging.Repair parts: Some parts may be hard to find.Age of technology: Older infotainment and safety tech.Safety features: Limited safety features compared to modern cars.Emissions: Older models may not meet modern emissions standards.,btohqsg
whos car say now so sexy,btohqsg
also  older models not meeting emissions is normal.,btohqsg
plus  classic imports are exempt lol,btohqsg
quite sure this is from ChatGPT because the NSX is unlikely to depreciate.,btohqsg
but hey i get what u mean,btohqsg
despite all that  i think at the end of the day it comes down to the love for the hobby  factors like fuel efficiency or maintenance costs is definitely a deterrent but its part and parcel of owning such a car,btohqsg
