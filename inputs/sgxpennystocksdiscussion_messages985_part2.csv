12 pips down already from the recent high of 53 for GS. Feels like almost at the tail end of the flush  along with some TA support line. Mayve can start to watch more closely already. Lets see. OSOD/DYODD,btohqsg

Just for easy reference:GS Hldg most recent buy back was on the 13th Dec 24 when they bought from open market at approx. $0.0459Source:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/QQNFFN9VCZJE48PN/828071__Form%203%20-%20ZTS%20Holdings%20Pte%20Ltd.pdf,btohqsg
Just 2nd Dec 2024   GS Hldg open market purchase was at $0.04871.Hence  with them hitting a support level and an area of value  hopefully the SSH continues the buy back which should help it recover from the recent flush.DYoDD.Source:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/5YIYZV87MGR3VMFA/827378__Form%203%20-%20ZTS%20Holdings%20Pte%20Ltd.pdf,btohqsg

Noticed this pattern that GS on the 13th day of retracement  they usually have a decent size bounce recovery type of candle.Today is the 12th day of the flush since $0.053 spike . Will it be another lucky 13?Interesting to see if the pattern shall repeat.DYoDD / OSOD . Added today. Hope for the best 🙏,btohqsg
