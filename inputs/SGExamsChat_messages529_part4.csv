Which 5ks did u do to complete SPM,btohqsg
I did a few  so I didn't really count tbh,btohqsg
I just took with my friends,btohqsg
But I should have enough to clear,btohqsg
Else I'll just go out and work,btohqsg
I don't have a lot of places in mind yet  but probably ucla  uc berkeley  toronto,btohqsg
I don't have a definite place in mind that I want to go for certain yet  cos it depends on whether I will get accepted or not,btohqsg
You intend to do pure maths?,btohqsg
Yeah probably gonna do combinations  which is more down to earth,btohqsg
I am ready to question my life in the US,btohqsg
Then come back NUS be prof,btohqsg
I think if you enter academia you don't really have a lot of choices of where you want to be stationed in,btohqsg
My prof for MA1100T was SPM alumni,btohqsg
Was his first teaching mod in NUS,btohqsg
Yeah haha he definitely goes through a lot of content,btohqsg
My friend took 2202S under TKM last sem,btohqsg
I also took 2202S under him and yeah it was very hard,btohqsg
His tutorial questions are like 10 non-easy questions,btohqsg
You can easily burn like 15 hours doing just one tutorial sheet  spread across a few days,btohqsg
Yeah I heard it was harder so...,btohqsg
Luckily I’m not taking under him,btohqsg
Yeah I heard it was super hard,btohqsg
I think his exams are not super well set also,btohqsg
My friend was complaining about that,btohqsg
It's like 1 mark 1 mark 1 mark questions,btohqsg
And the questions are like  either you see it or not,btohqsg
That's how I feel about it anyways,btohqsg
Yes that was what I heard,btohqsg
It's definitely not the worst I've seen  but it's not good either,btohqsg
I’ve heard bad things about CSK,btohqsg
Later I run into them and get destroyed,btohqsg
I mean you'll definitely see your fair share of bad exams in nus,btohqsg
Even the best prof can set a bad exam just because it is so hard to gauge the difficulty,btohqsg
Thanks for coming to my ted talk,btohqsg
I didn’t really plan for the break,btohqsg
Since I was buzy clearing 8 mods,btohqsg
Ahh I'm doing something called RIPS  you can definitely consider it next break,btohqsg
It's more applied than pure but still interesting,btohqsg
Can’t believe I never heard of it,btohqsg
Since I seem to be tending more towards applied maths now,btohqsg
They usually send an email about Feb-ish?,btohqsg
So you can keep a lookout for it,btohqsg
bruh why all of a sudden all the admins active af,btohqsg
This group's member count has been dropping steadily,btohqsg
I thought it would be dead by now,btohqsg
The new spammers seem to have those telegram premium icons beside their name,btohqsg
Yeah there are some with the star beside their name as well,btohqsg
you weren’t even part of it-,btohqsg
guess everyone savoring the last bit of their holiday,btohqsg
i out of school already LOL but i did too when i was still in school,btohqsg
