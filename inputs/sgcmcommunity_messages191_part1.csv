Sorry bro I don‚Äôt drive Volvo,btohqsg
volvo no upz leh  no buyer at all,btohqsg
not like your harrier so upz,btohqsg
Just like harrier is a cheap lexus,btohqsg
Yea. Do phv use so exp car for what,btohqsg
dont say like tht leh  brother use original ATF for less than $10/bottle,btohqsg
people who drive at 200kph with no seat belt and botak tyres deserve more respect ok,btohqsg
No la. One day earn $1000 w a harrier more respect,btohqsg
It‚Äôs quite confusing abt the seatbelt  Taobao and harrier,btohqsg
QX1UVolvo S90Believe it is Mr K. Shanmugam car too haha,btohqsg
hi out of curiousity  for cars like CX-5 with auto hold and i-stop function  can both be used at the same time or only one at a time?,btohqsg
auto hold is for parking brake  i-stop is when in drive mode,btohqsg
not possible to use both at the same time,btohqsg
They‚Äôre two different things. Auto hold puts the car on hand brake temporarily until you step the accelerator. Istop shuts off the engine to save fuel. They can be used automatically and simultaneously during a traffic jam,btohqsg
not very intuitive... when you in drive mode also can use auto hold.. but like activating cheat code in a game,btohqsg
oh yes i was wondering this. lets say im at red light  can use auto hold and i stop together?,btohqsg
you have to go ask the SA,btohqsg
Can. When you‚Äôre approaching a red light you step the foot brake until car stationary  car goes into auto hold until you step acceleration again. Engine running long enough on idle  it will auto shut off (istop) until you step acceleration again.,btohqsg
means you won't have to shift from D to P every time like those uncle drivers,btohqsg

That why buy new car is better .,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt this the gtr that went to mt everest,btohqsg
Hallu Abang ! Long time no see,btohqsg
Exactly.. before I buy he promise the car will be given Swee Swee like brand new  when take over the car still got abrasion  all these not fix not clean,btohqsg
good catch. Looks like the same carhttps://mothership.sg/2016/11/heres-how-sporean-drove-nissan-gt-r-for-16000km-from-spore-to-everest-back/,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt u start a business doing ppi for others. Since visual check can already and u are good at it. I‚Äôm sure nothing will bite back at you,btohqsg
Actually that is not really the dealer‚Äôs fault. If the wheel Bearing was already faulty  u would have heard something during the test drive. It‚Äôs just down to bad luck that u got it after a month. And yes wear and tear not covered.Most dealers/warranty covers only engine and gearbox issues,btohqsg
Servicing is not compulsory when they handover the car  though it can be negotiated  depending on mileage till next servicing. Even if bought from AD. And car plate LED  again  it‚Äôs just bad luck  but anyway it‚Äôs like a $10 thing,btohqsg
U could have changed so many wheel bearings for yourself,btohqsg
His wheel bearings would only cost $10 each coz he master sourcer one,btohqsg
Other people $400-500. He only $10-15 max. And that‚Äôs on a bad day.,btohqsg
He already. From PHV. Don‚Äôt downgrade him pls‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Be careful if the dealer let you test the car on low petrol  it's their dirty trick,btohqsg
Ooh never heard of this before haha. Thanks for the heads up,btohqsg
Yeah  insist go top up petrol so you can drive further and faster,btohqsg
I generally will check cos most of the cars they don‚Äôt keep a lot of petrol in it for money saving purposes,btohqsg
The one I had tested  left only 1 bar petrol and gave lame excuse no time to top up,btohqsg
Lol I drive till I don‚Äôt see any bars on my own car,btohqsg
After you whack  car spoil how? Who pay,btohqsg
but i test drive with my fren before,btohqsg
he really pedal to the metal. then i tell him car cannot buy,btohqsg
if 5min whack car can die means car PROBLEM LIAO BROOO,btohqsg
lol like this dealership i went to before to view c180k  petrol so low already  car whacked with modification  when on   very loud knocking noise the fella say is the turbocharger üò≠,btohqsg
Yes sir. Car old liao  need to use premium fuel to feel young,btohqsg
Anyone familiar on how a certain tele group is selling short term cars below 10k and buying them back at almost 90% of their value after its coe end,btohqsg
interested in how they are able to obtain new cars everyday to sell,btohqsg
