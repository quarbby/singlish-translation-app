even if they can do it on mices  its prob way more complicated on humans,btohqsg
so we will have a perpetual rodent infestation. Cos they just wun die,btohqsg
They make them look and feel young tho,btohqsg
Looks young  feels young  must be young,btohqsg
Yea for now  but imagine they succeed and the rats escape,btohqsg
But why would humans wana be immortal anw,btohqsg
There is this scifi show called in time,btohqsg
Everyone can possibly be immortal by moderating ur gene expression and then we can basically tag ur wealth to ur lifespan,btohqsg
Of u are poor u will run out of time and die,btohqsg
Isnt that just wads happening now either way?,btohqsg
hmm is this about malthusian trap?,btohqsg
I think they are trying to classify aging as a disease,btohqsg
Live so long just to generate more waste and more problems,btohqsg
What I am thinking is what if your parents and grands parents look young again,btohqsg
the only reason we seek meaning is cos we die,btohqsg
What if there is nothing after death,btohqsg
Children don’t know that they will die,btohqsg
Imagine immortality is there  then resource constraints will be much worse,btohqsg
Burdened with the reality of death,btohqsg
What if you become a cyborg in the future,btohqsg
Or enable immortality but sterilise everyone,btohqsg
the religious live life as they do cos they belive their actions here have long term consequence,btohqsg
Imagine suddenly got world ending event then how,btohqsg
the non religious live their life as they do because yolo  theres nothing after death,btohqsg
If aliens show up  does that undermine religion,btohqsg
speculate or stroke our psyche all we want and give reasons to die  we all die nonetheless,btohqsg
There are no mention of aliens in some religious texts  I believe,btohqsg
Hence why some religious people don’t believe in cells,btohqsg
no fun mingling with the same 7 billion over and over again,btohqsg
imagine a world whereby donald trump can become president over and over,btohqsg
I am not too clear about the religion part,btohqsg

You are now banned from r/childfree,btohqsg

In very unrelated news  anyone want to drink some kool aid,btohqsg

there was a cult that held a party and let thousands of ppl drink kool aid.... it was drugged and all died,btohqsg
erm trying to catch up with westworld  the americans now,btohqsg
the cult was in the us in 1960s i believe,btohqsg
