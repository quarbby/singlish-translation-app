Is HSBC Revolution / EGA rewards still available?,btohqsg
Depends on what is your other $1.5k spend.,btohqsg
Assuming its eligible spending for both maybank platinum and uob one card. Which one better in this case?,btohqsg
There are better cashback out there. Up to 8%-10%. Why focus on 3.33%?,btohqsg
Do I apply for credit card first or bank account first if I don‚Äôt want to have to go down physically?,btohqsg
Because these are the two cards I have and I wanna focus on those 2 well before I go for other cards with higher cashback. So which is better in my scenario?,btohqsg
To withdraw from Moomoo cashplus  we have to wait T+2 trading days in order to withdraw am i correct..,btohqsg
Seems counter intuitive to have both cards together... lolWhy not split your spending between Maybank Platinum Visa + UOB EVOL? Assuming you have a UOB card to clock the spending for UOB One Account.Maybank Platinum Visa: 1k insurance + 500 other eligible spending for tier 2 (assuming you able to do it for 3 months straight)UOB EVOL: 250 online/250 mobile contactless/100 other eligible spending (to hit minimum spend)Quarterly you get 100 + 120 = 220 cashbackYearly you get 220 x 4 = 880 cashbackTotal spending is 1500 + 600 = 2100 per month (which is within your assumption of 2500 spending),btohqsg
Sorry  I have no knowledge on this as I m not interested on 3.33% using insurance.,btohqsg
Thanks melvyn  I was thinking to allocate first to evol card with 600  second to maybank platinum card hit tier 2 with 500 (excluding my insurance) and anything more all in my uob one card. I'm just dilemma whether should try to hit tier 3 of Maybank card,btohqsg
If you spend 1600 of eligible spending then sure.. that's 500 more per month compared to what I calculated above.Which leads to 320/qtr and 1280/yr in terms of cashback.But you have to know you're spending 1500 more quarterly just to get 100 more cashback.,btohqsg
Normally for me and my family  we do have big spending as 2 kids. Previously I can just park my insurance spending at mb and focus on evol and uob1 cards but now mb revised. That's why I have to rethink and reallocate to get the best cashback. Sigh.,btohqsg
Honestly  if you spend 1600 monthly and some of the spending are eligible for the additional bonus cashback for UOB One Card  might as well ignore the 3.33% from Maybank Platinum Card lol.UOB One with 1000 spending that includes the eligible spending for bonus additional cashback (up to 50 monthly)  you'll get 250/qtyUOB EVOL with the remaining 600 spending  you'll get 120/qtyTotal cashback per quarter: 250 + 120 = 370Yearly that would be 1480. Which is 200 more than using Maybank Platinum Card.But ya  Maybank screwed over those who try to get cashback from insurance. Which is honestly sooner or later kinda thing.,btohqsg
I guess its because insurance are not eligible for the uob cards I have.,btohqsg
I having second thoughts of getting Maybank card but even with the nerf  I think it'll might still give me more than what I have rn as I don't have a high amount of other spending.The lowest tier of 150+150 to get 30/qtr seems fine for my use case... I don't really think I can even hit 500 other eligible spending for tier 2. ü§™,btohqsg
Not financial advice... just doing quick maffs üåö 2+2 is 4,btohqsg
I can't thank enough üòå I'm having headache after this revise.. sigh,btohqsg
Anyways  back to the original calculation of 1100 other eligible spending that was originally used to get tier 2 for Maybank Platinum Card...If you can get UOB One bonus additional cashback within the 500 (tier 1)  you'll also get 25/qtr more cashback per month compared to Maybank Platinum Visa.Which is 100/yr more cashback from UOB One and adding UOB EVOL  you'll get 980/yr total cashback instead of 880/yr with Maybank Platinum Visa.But.... if you really cannot even get 1 cent of the UOB One additional cashback (which is VERY difficult  considering that Shopee  Dairy Farm Merchants  Grab  SimplyGo  SP and Petrol are quite commonly visited for most people with family)  then you can use your insurance spending with Maybank Platinum Card ü§£,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I would like to apply for Citi Rewards MC for an upcoming holiday trip day expenses. The singsaver signup promo of $300 PayNow seems more attractive than the 16000 miles from Citi themselves.https://www.singsaver.com.sg/credit-card/best-dealsHowever I see that on the Singsaver signup it says 3 Sept 2023. May I check the following?1. Does it mean I will be eligible if I sign up with singsaver on 3 September + hit min spend OR does 3 September refer to the time Singsaver reach out to Citi for approval  which may take some working days?2. From the time I submit the form on singsaver  around how long will it take to receive the credit card to start spending?3. Any stories where the 30 days start counting since card approval but the card didn‚Äôt arrive until near the end of the 30 days?,btohqsg
So you mean as below?Evol - 600Maybank tier 2 - 500 (to total 1k)Uob1 - tier 1 - 500Total 1 100 spending.,btohqsg
No.. like I said  it's counter intuitive to use both. UOB EVOL is a must to clock 600  the rest either UOB One or Maybank Platinum Visa. Tier 2 and tier 3 of Maybank Platinum Visa is trash compared to UOB One equivalent tiers (after the nerf).Only use Maybank Platinum Visa if you don't spend a single cent on any of the following:1. Shopee2. Grab3. Dairy Farm Merchants (e.g. Giant  Guardian  7-11  etc)4. SimplyGo (i.e. Bus and Train)5. Singapore Power6. Petrol at Shell or SPCORIf you have extra spending of 150 to get their tier 1 cashback of 30/qtr. ü§£So basically:1. UOB EVOL - 6002. UOB One - 500/1000/20003. Maybank Platinum Visa - 150 (and 150 insurance),btohqsg
Really wrong move for Maybank to nerf their card that hard. Then again  it feels like they were giving out free cashback to those already paying for insurance lolol,btohqsg
Whats best card for purchases like a few k,btohqsg
You can start by checking out Chris' videos on YouTube. You might want to look at UOB One Card if you can hit 2k of eligible spending every month.,btohqsg
Yeah i cant. Usually just 500 to get the uob one interest. This purchase is somewhat rare,btohqsg
If for 1 time thing then look for the card with the best sign up gift that you can hit with that 1 time spending. ü§£,btohqsg
"""Each principal DBS Altitude Visa Signature Cardmember is entitled to 2 complimentary lounge visits per12-month membership period."" - Does this refer to per calendar year or from the month which the credit card was approved?",btohqsg

Does Moomoo and tiger broker charge if no trade?,btohqsg
Hi is anyone a shopee seller here?üòä,btohqsg
