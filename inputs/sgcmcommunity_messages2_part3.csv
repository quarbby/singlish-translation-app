Always found the UX a bit small and RX a bit too big. NX would be a good balance.,btohqsg
NX really impressive . I would probably go for either IS or ES… ES abit pricy though….,btohqsg
Ya it is. At least this time the FL model they got rid of the touchpad for the infotainment. IS good for a daily driver but a bit small at the back.,btohqsg
ES price about the same as the brand new NX350… crazy …. Hard to afford .. unless they got promo hahaha 🤣,btohqsg
In fact I think Toyota harrier luxury specs about the same as the ES. Just some outdated infotainment system,btohqsg
Ya actually Harrier is also not a bad choice too.,btohqsg
I personally don’t mind the interface too much so as long there is apple CarPlay or android auto.,btohqsg

Hey just enquiring I'm currently looking to buy a new car but is ok to buy a new diesel car now?,btohqsg
Can i still drive diesel car after 2025 when the government stop continuing diesel cars on the road?,btohqsg
You should be able to. So far policy is that they will take 20 years as a hard cap for combustion engines (diesel or petrol) at 2040 to be phased out. So meanwhile if you get it now  you should be able to drive it till 2032 max before you have to scrap it by 2040 anyway.Just that 2025 onwards cannot buy new diesel cars alr. Existing ones unless they announce incentives or what not to scrap them  it should still be able to be used provided it meets the emissions standard and requirements.,btohqsg
But maybe don’t get diesel. So you don’t need to think about this problem at all. Just get petrol hybrid or EV.,btohqsg

post a question on electric vehicle readiness for singapore  what are everyone's opinion on getting a electric car in 2022 ?My take is :1. given that our charging network still not 100% ready  not every HDB carpark has charging point2. charging takes sooo long4. range anxiety5. visibility of gov's relief scheme in the near future is not clear6. for ppl staying at HDB suppose 80% of the population / or even condos may struggle  so not a best time to get it now...,btohqsg
Owning a ev is a lifestyle change. U need to change the way u use the car.Go to places / malls with ports  etc.Make parking part of charging.U cant use it like a nrml petrol car - only fill up when its low. It shld be something like e every time u have the chance to pump/charge then just charge a little kind.fyi - I nt owning a ev  just hearing for people that owns one,btohqsg
thinking of my iphone  its capacity drop 20% after 500+ charge cycle. and it loses charge even on standby....it would scary for battery car too,btohqsg

Hello  thanks for the query! Quotz only allows dealers to bid as dealers will need to purchase the vehicle as of its current condition and they are required to make payment in full cash. Based on our experience  most consumers prefer taking up a loan to purchase a vehicle.,btohqsg
