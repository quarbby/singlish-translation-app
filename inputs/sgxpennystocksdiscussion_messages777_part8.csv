WTI crude futures traded around $74.5 per barrel on Friday and were headed for the second straight weekly advance  underpinned by supply concerns and an improving demand outlook. A dispute involving Kurdish authorities which halted exports of around 400 000 barrels a day from the Ceyhan port in Turkey tightened the market this week  and seemed unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. OPEC's de-facto leader Saudi Arabia also said the oil cartel should keep supplies steady for 2023 as it navigates a fragile recovery in global oil demand  recently clouded by the banking turmoil. On the demand side  investors remain optimistic about China’s recovery  with PetroChina and Cnooc Ltd. saying a rebounding domestic economy can help cushion the impact of slower global growth. Meanwhile  markets continued to assess the likely direction of central bank monetary policy in light of the recent banking crisis.,btohqsg
