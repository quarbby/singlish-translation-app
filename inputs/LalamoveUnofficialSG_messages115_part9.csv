Can consider hovering around city fringe but now NDP period abit tricky. Then again you're bike so shd be ok,btohqsg
Try to stack logically and strategically to maximize ur earnings,btohqsg
BTW  if I get the order at 9am but I only manage to reach at 930 due to traffic  they send and claim I'm 30 min late.... I thought we have 30min time to pickup,btohqsg
Anywhere should be ok but hot spots are commonly known at geylang,btohqsg
So don't take orders that are far away,btohqsg

Poor IKEA Raymond from GOGOVAN hiding in Stirling road multi storey carpark. Because banned from going into IKEA...too cruel already and always complain about drivers resulting in suspension and termination. What goes around always comes around. Kudos to the promoter at IKEA Alexandra who made him banned from entering so drivers gets their fair share of orders.,btohqsg
Hi Driver Partners!Due to power outage  there will be a slight delay in response from a Customer Service Agent. For any order / further enquiries  do write in toinfo.sg@lalamove.com. We apologise for the inconvenience.,btohqsg
Write email waste even more time. ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
Does anyone know what is the penalty for lalamove if late?,btohqsg
I realised that lalamove is really siding customer instead of us. There was once i encountered delivering a food. Despite calling and knocking on the door  no one answered. Put it outside.,btohqsg
Note: only one bag of food which i went to ask the food vendor how much it cost: $6.,btohqsg
However the customer claimed that it was $40+ and i had to pay for the lost food which i placed it outside the person's door.,btohqsg
Appealed but lalamove doesnt care at all and just deduct from wallet.,btohqsg
