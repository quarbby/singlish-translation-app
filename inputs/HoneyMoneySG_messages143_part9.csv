Okay! Thank you! üòäBecause I‚Äôve been using IBKR to invest using options and I wanted to start diversifying into another brokerage account for dividends. Maybe Singapore dividends.Wondering if anyone else is doing too. üòä,btohqsg
not true  there is no extra amount. There is 10cents per trip just to act as placeholder which will be refunded. Standard for using mastercards for simplygo  nothing to do with amaze.,btohqsg
hi gurus  if i managed to sign up for this  does this mean that i will need to incur the 3.25% exchange rate fees for every foreign currency transaction i make? is there a way to minimize such fees?also  this means i will need to select the destination country's currency while making my booking  right?,btohqsg

hi everyone  any thoughts on AIA pro achiever?,btohqsg
oh wah haha thought it was a decent plan to get into for a new investor,btohqsg
You can definitely do better yourself (with ample research) or even with a roboadvisor (with some fees  lower than ILPs  better managed - imo).,btohqsg
I see. A friend recommended the plan as a fuss free invesmtent plan. So e.g. just put like 800 every month then forget about it,btohqsg
Fuss free way to give money to the company... üìâ,btohqsg

Amaze+CRMC  Trust Cashback  UOB Lady's  depends on what you're spending on.,btohqsg
I am planning to mainly use CRMC + Amaze and I am considering to apply Trust Cashback Card. Seems like a good card to spend overseas.,btohqsg
Nonetheless  YouTrip is a really good card to keep on hand as a backup.,btohqsg

never appeal before  but if small txn easier to appeal than larger ones,btohqsg

When I am booking a family trip in SQ  do I earn kris miles only for my own ticket or the whole family?,btohqsg
They have to book their flight themselves to earn their miles I suppose?,btohqsg
There are 2 miles earning parts.1. Paying airfares will earn u credit card miles. You will get all the miles.2. Flying SQ will earn KF miles. Each person will earn their own miles.,btohqsg
Go to yuu app  tab on DBS under ‚ÄòExplore Top Brands‚Äô,btohqsg
Hello  anyone got their SC save up level up cashback for month of August ?,btohqsg
Is it possible to add 2 yuu cards (one visa and one amex) in one yuu account? I don't see the options being possible in my account at the moment...seems to only be able to add one yuu and one passion card. Am I doing anything wrong?,btohqsg
Hi guys am planning to get a new cc with either hsbc  ocbc or dbs to get rewards by buying phone at whymobile shop at far east. I guess that is considered as mobile contactless. Could anyone suggest any cards other than say uob ppv or vs please? Thank you.,btohqsg
Well I think you already know ur answer üòÅ,btohqsg
the other yuu card will be auto added couple of days later,btohqsg

no wonder ok thank you so much!!,btohqsg
7th November get already. August participation with September October funds.,btohqsg
Ahh ok  means I didn't qualify,btohqsg
Did u register and did u have $100k fresh funds?,btohqsg
Will have email informing u if u are successful in registration,btohqsg
hi all  am aiming to get a new credit card. thinking of miles with expenditure mainly on dining/ retail with local spend. DBS Yuu card is the most current play?,btohqsg
Not  but I received SMS instead of successful registration and fund by 31 August,btohqsg
Show it. Does it say anything successful,btohqsg
yuu card only get great rewards for yuu merchants though,btohqsg
i see  recommended cards for general retail spending? maybe UOB lady's?,btohqsg
uob lady only good for whitelisted MCCs under your selected category.Maybe use Amaze+citi rewards mastercard to get 4mpd capped at 1k in statement month for any offline spend so long mcc not excluded (travel related and public transport etc excluded)  citi rewards without amaze for online spend. I assumed your spending is less than 1k monthly.,btohqsg
Thanks üôè think some months will be more,btohqsg
Because I am a existing uob card holder so I won't get any rewards from like singsaver. Thank you for the advice Anthony.,btohqsg
im using uob lady's as transport for now just signed up so will get annual fee waived.. maybe along the way wait for some improvements on the cards options for transport.. will dbs wwc be a good option for me?currently holding - crmc + citi premiermiles (signed up when i grad so accumulated some miles) + uob ladys.. (pending to cancel hsbc revo and sc smart),btohqsg
dun see the link between dbs wwmc and public transport,btohqsg
Maybe he use grab daily or heavy petrol usage haha,btohqsg
