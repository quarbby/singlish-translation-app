But nowadays the engine old alr so the fc not as good as b4,btohqsg
10k servicing I forgot. The engine still runs good,btohqsg
But one minor downside I noticed is this age of the engine  around 5k to 6k it starting to drink EO,btohqsg
Atleast for my cs2 it happens,btohqsg
I still remember when I first got my car  I went for servicing. The EO left less than 1L üòÇ,btohqsg

Hahah ya  but still super reliable,btohqsg
15k haven't go servicing  just top up EO the engine still runs like a bull,btohqsg

hi guys my friends and i want to start a car detailing washhow much money will y‚Äôall spend in honest opinion.and if you pay a $100 package  what will you expect to see or get,btohqsg
Weren't they only LHD for the US market?,btohqsg
And is this the b58 or b48,btohqsg
I remember reading that the manual was originally meant only for north American market and a few others,btohqsg
I'm guessing this is a PI anyway,btohqsg
Toyota not that stupid to not give them yaris and give them supra,btohqsg
Japan alr had the manual one fot awhile alr,btohqsg
Keiichi tsuchiya and gang madr a few videos alr,btohqsg
Prefer the supra body to the z4 anyway and the b58 is arguably one of the best engine platforms out there rn,btohqsg
Really will be the A80 of modern day,btohqsg
Ytd toto nv open for me. If not today i go order alr,btohqsg
i don't even want to find out,btohqsg
That time you say prefer Z cos it's not BMW,btohqsg
I also dk which one i want,btohqsg
but its not a true supra la,btohqsg
but Z has never reached supra status,btohqsg
I think Z itself also got very long legacy,btohqsg
Supra is overhyped by fast and furious ba,btohqsg
in the end  you will drive your mx5  and i'll continue with the honda,btohqsg
I mean  i'm not complaining if that happens la,btohqsg
i'm sorry honda make good stuff,btohqsg
That comment gonna trigger alot of ppl,btohqsg
hamilton also said he's never seen a car so fast,btohqsg
cos he cant' see his own car,btohqsg
Everyone else so much slower than him,btohqsg
but yours should put the hard top,btohqsg
I still open my top every other day,btohqsg
lock to some long kang railing,btohqsg
gonna try throw smth in 1 day,btohqsg
i'm damn happy got the beIN channel,btohqsg

can watch the channel from the tv thats all,btohqsg
wha... i have to delete@Derek_dtanfrom fb already,btohqsg
but i enjoying toto wolff face now,btohqsg
this dominance from rb also abit sian,btohqsg
nvm la perez also doing ok,btohqsg
perez win a few more  they will forget max,btohqsg
"like the old dude said  ""we have no main driver""",btohqsg
normal times perez quite hard to get infront of max,btohqsg
his qualifying and his race start cmi,btohqsg
how come you're not on my facebook,btohqsg
RB now titi 1-2 also not much meh,btohqsg
Why your name so long one,btohqsg
got cheena name also to make longer,btohqsg
he simi honda accord euro r,btohqsg
can't wait for updates on the wing,btohqsg
But Japan unlikely will be a scam ba,btohqsg
can't decide on one end up nv put,btohqsg
but the feel a bit odd now,btohqsg
toe in instead of toe out,btohqsg
i want to see if my fc improves,btohqsg
where gt ppl buy advan apex for FC de,btohqsg
where got euro r get 7km per litre,btohqsg
its also more stable with the toe in,btohqsg
it feels like the car always wants to straighten itself,btohqsg
Toe-in effects are mostly provided for rear-wheel drive cars  trucks  and SUVs  as this offers better straight line stability. The downside is that turning response is a bit more sluggish.,btohqsg
u can go drag race liao,btohqsg
where else previously it gave a feel of easily turning in the direction of the road,btohqsg
i'll run a tank of petrol to see how first,btohqsg
also the toe out has very high wear on the inner tyre,btohqsg
already cambered at 2 front  1.1 rear,btohqsg
camber inner wear  toe in outer wear,btohqsg
something like that... haven't tried to push it,btohqsg
all say need to let the tyres run in,btohqsg
tiger de estimation is the lowest i have seen haha,btohqsg
all scared de say 1 tank,btohqsg
Then go try the merits of the tires liao‚ò∫,btohqsg
i shall turn at legal speeds,btohqsg
If never push abit wun know the limits of the tires,btohqsg
road limit 60  turn at 60,btohqsg
Dun open Ur tec at corners yaüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
i get 8 in my miot,btohqsg
So i think your 7km may be normal,btohqsg
some claim to even get 10,btohqsg
I only get 10 when i go KL,btohqsg
with my wing i think will be the same,btohqsg
you install spoiler cfm drop more one,btohqsg
cuz too slow to have any effect,btohqsg
but its not really a gt wing,btohqsg
wont be as draggy as a gt wing ba,btohqsg
nvm la u 2 weeks pump once,btohqsg
if my orange light on  i can pump about 54L,btohqsg
When i reservist everyday from kranji camp back to paya lebar i can hit 10,btohqsg
i wish they call me for reservist,btohqsg
your final drive stock is it,btohqsg
I may be a JDM siao,btohqsg
u need my spoon ecu la,btohqsg
but i will not be stupid to pay 18k for FD2R when i can get a manual M3,btohqsg
If i use urs i think wont get 10km/L,btohqsg
but your speedo got do correction or not,btohqsg
U add tgt total i think still can fight fd2r,btohqsg
Cos fd2r 18k depre is cheap alr,btohqsg
when you on gps  is it same as your speedo,btohqsg
Or vs evo or what even,btohqsg
I'll choose the manual m3 anyday,btohqsg
That time peter ask me do,btohqsg
I think recently not long ago 16k depre fd2r 4 years,btohqsg
high chance yours is a little off,btohqsg
Yea alittle only compare to gps,btohqsg
Now is more or less compare is the same,btohqsg
Should be pass with flying colours bag,btohqsg
