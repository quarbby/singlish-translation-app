In the first place didnt notice they changed bike price to this:,btohqsg
But if u calculate the jobs its even higher @$0.40/km,btohqsg
nice. maybe coz airasia coming in at 70c/km on tuesday 2march.,btohqsg
Eh but then... Their distance always like short of 2km lol,btohqsg
If u compare it against your own map,btohqsg
or maybe just need more bikers. its the cheapest option on the lalamove menu.,btohqsg
Last time was $10 under 3km  now become $10  under 1km  good news!,btohqsg
Ya no more short change 3kmIt was always $10 under 1km with the old app,btohqsg
Ok the jump-scrolling in the app or whatever u call it is seriously damn irritating,btohqsg
Ya laCant even see 1 job properly ðŸ™„,btohqsg
No job complainToo many job also complainðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
they really should have a filter vehicle option,btohqsg
Filter everything...vehicle  day  time  locationEvery other app has it except llm zzz,btohqsg
ya lo I got feedback to them before.. Guess they really scared bike order even lesser ppl take,btohqsg
Well ..... not having filter doesnt make ppl more likely to take bike order  if they dont intend toLol,btohqsg
ya lo... hopefully they start listening to their drivers loðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
"They jus need to try the app themselves one time and they will immediately realise ""omg how can we design the app liddat""",btohqsg
i think they removed the filter coz nobody wanted the town/central jobs and filtered those out.,btohqsg
give the central jobs more exposure.,btohqsg
coz on my app about 8 out of 10 jobs are town based.,btohqsg
But even without filter u will still self-filter mahIf a person doesnt want town jobs its also likely he/she is not near town  not filtering the jobs wont make the driver want to take town jobs,btohqsg
but if town-job are the only jobs visible then no choice.,btohqsg
coz thats what my options are on some days.,btohqsg
Then they cannot half past 6 liddat la... Let ppl pick but want to tell u what to pick,btohqsg
theres a limit to the number of jobs displayed  so when the immediate town jobs fill up the list  cannot see the evening or next days jobs anymore.,btohqsg
must wait until like 10pm at night then can browse next day.,btohqsg
Hmm then maybe the issue is ppl taking more advanced than immediate,btohqsg
^ thats a good thing. if you were a customer booking in advance you would want early confirmation.,btohqsg
is there a way to feedback to LLM about putting the filters back?,btohqsg
But i think not so in realityMany issues with drivers come from advanced orders  and many get pban becos of itLate  no show  last min cancellations etc,btohqsg
You are the best when itâ€™s comes to scamming,btohqsg
Yah in the midst of delivery,btohqsg
Half way broken chat and prompts user cancelled?,btohqsg
