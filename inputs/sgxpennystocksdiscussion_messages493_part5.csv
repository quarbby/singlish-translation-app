Pika World Daily Update: 4 August 2021The equity market had a rough start  with S&P 500 shining as it closes to a record. This is on the backdrop of a rise in Covid cases and ongoing slowing economic growth seen in various parts of the economy.Setting Long Sight for Chinese StocksWhile the Chinese government's extensive spate of regulatory initiatives had unnerved investors  Pika World believes that the painful ramification impacts had extrapolated to other sectors that may not justify the long-term prospect of growth seen in China.With the US increasing scrutiny into Chinese listings  the near term outlook for Chinese equities remains under pressure. Nonetheless  Pika World believes that the Chinese government's ultimate aim is to focus on social issues and the country's interest in controlling data for national security concerns.The general sentiment that China is going after commercial businesses is unlikely to be true since private enterprises supply about 80% of the employment in large Chinese cities. Moreover  these large enterprises have expertise that the Chinese government is keen to deepen to maintain its technological edge against the US.Big Risk PremiumIndeed  the current risk premium on Chinese stocks is enormous. The large Chinese tech companies are now trading at a 30% discount in terms of PE ratio compared to their global peers  which provides a decent ground for some level of accumulation.Is US Regulation a Big Concern?Pika World believes that the worry has been over-amplified in the media. On the contrary  the US may have a limited impact on Chinese listings. The US investors account for less than 3% of the China and Hong Kong market cap combined  and this means that in terms of the viability of the Chinese market  they can broadly survive without the need for the US  although as an investor  this is the last straw we will like to see.Are There Opportunities in China?Based on our reading research  Pika World sees pockets of opportunities in the healthcare sector similar to our analysis of a defensive stock nature pick for the US market. There is a freeing up of regulation to allow innovative companies to tap into funding. Online businesses are also looking attractive.To note  Pika World does not see the Chinese government movement as a critical risk. On the contrary  the most significant risk lies in countries where we see impending regulations  but they have yet to be acted upon  and this uncertainty is the true risk compared to what we have seen in China.What's on the Menu Today?At 8.15 pm  we will receive the ADP Nonfarm Employment Change  and we expect to be at 695K  comparable to 692K in the prior period.At 9.45 pm  we will also have the Markit Composite PMI data  and at 10 pm  FOMC member Clarida will speak.At the same time  the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI data will be released  and we expect a reading of 60.5 compared to 60.1 in the prior period.Finally  10.30 pm brings us the Crude Oil Inventories  which will see a milder drawdown of 2.900M compared to a reduction of 4.089M.It is 4 August  Wednesday  8.15 am in Singapore and 8.15 pm in New York. The market is digesting new information on the economic outlook  and we hope you have a prosperous week ahead too!If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a broader audience.,btohqsg
