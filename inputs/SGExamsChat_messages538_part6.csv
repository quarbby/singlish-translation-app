you have yet to finish your art?,btohqsg
4am 4 days in a row..4th day will fall sick alr,btohqsg
everyone ard me is sick and i am so prone cause my immune system is kinda weak i got covid twice,btohqsg
i cant man and they refuse to wear a mask üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
thats why i said try to avoid any possible way to fall sick like mugging,btohqsg
oh i can do the long pomodoro method,btohqsg
you done your writeups for art?,btohqsg
ohh art no worries just do in sch i just damn tired when i come home,btohqsg
but i need to redo my annotations cuz i used chatgpt,btohqsg
aint there a portfolio..like you have to do,btohqsg
i think thats only if uw go nafa or laselle,btohqsg
my tutor cut down to 4 chaps for me to memorise,btohqsg
i think u meant for the boards,btohqsg
for board just need redo annotations on docs,btohqsg
Stalin and Hitler will be the major ones...both are content heavy chapters,btohqsg
so eg:mon 2 h math then 2 h sciencetue: hist 2h math 2hwed : ss 2h science 2,btohqsg
Japan..cuban missle crisis (they are theoretically easier because most of it is common sense),btohqsg
i am supposed to finish memorising stalin by today,btohqsg
oh..was abt to ask if you alr did the memorisation for the 5 yr plan,btohqsg
oh i js spam consults w online teachers and my sch for eng,btohqsg
hahahs i am still at rise,btohqsg
cuz i use pomodoro so i dont burn out,btohqsg
looks like its time for you to actually start,btohqsg
one is like mentor and ex cca teacher,btohqsg
my teachers just spam yt vids in class,btohqsg
i been asking for my history practice paper to be marked and my teacher took 2 weeks and still ask extension,btohqsg
in the hope that some shit goes into our minds,btohqsg
and he was like ‚Äúwah u ask for deadline also‚Äù,btohqsg
like yes cuz i need feedback,btohqsg
my humans is lanjiao to the max,btohqsg
if on docs sure i can on paper maybe not everyday,btohqsg
cuz it will grammar check right,btohqsg
i like to cram a lot things into a day and i find that i cant finish,btohqsg
end up push back all then i simply cant do anything,btohqsg
and how long does it take to memorise 1 history chapter,btohqsg
oh do i devote 2h to both sciences? or,btohqsg
when is there a subj without memorisation ü´†ü´†,btohqsg
so i devote at least 4 hrs of studying everyday?,btohqsg
You can try that and see how it goes,btohqsg
i did tried 6am-9pm but end up i wake up 11am start at 3,btohqsg
You see the history textbook 20+ pages üíÄ,btohqsg
The prob with history is knowing how to tell which factors is the easiest to understand and write down,btohqsg
Because at the end of the day  the qns is not going to be ‚ÄúList down all the factors that led to Stalin‚Äôs rise in the Soviet Union‚Äù rather ‚ÄúList down TWO factors that led to stalin‚Äôs rise in the Soviet Union‚Äù,btohqsg
ye it is better to know everything which is certainly impossible to memorise everything before i sleep,btohqsg
that why sort out the long and short factors,btohqsg
what i would do i memorise the factors that actually leads me to talk more about stalin's rise,btohqsg
like..if you would to ask me if you should memorise Trotsky's unpopularity or Non-Disclosure of Lenin's testimony....i would say memorise Trotsky  because there is more content that will foreshadow stalin's rise to power over lenin's death..where the testimony was sealed and that was basically it..nothing that could be added on to further improve your understanding,btohqsg
there are def more factors  im just telling you like a comparison,btohqsg
time to mug now and memorise everything üíîüíî,btohqsg
