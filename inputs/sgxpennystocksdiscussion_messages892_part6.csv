Citi Research has discontinued its coverage of iFast  more than two years after going against consensus calls and issuing “sell” on what was then Singapore’s best-performing stock.Citi Research analyst Tan Yong Hong’s last report  from October 2023  maintains the house’s “sell” call and $3.70 target price  reiterating that the wealth management platform’s underlying core business remains soft.Tan has also warned of “high risk” when trading iFast shares  a label that has stuck since the Mainboard-listed company announced plans to acquire a loss-making UK bank in January 2022.,btohqsg
