wow recruitment has revived john smith o_o,btohqsg
hi does anyone know if early admissions to uni is possible using cca just like Sec/jc?,btohqsg
cus I couldn't find this info online,btohqsg
your CCA can only be used for discretionary admission  early admission usually for those in army and want to matriculate a year earlier,btohqsg
only med or psc scholars can defer ns,btohqsg
early admissions you apply using prelim results/5th sem cgpa,btohqsg
you can matriculate into the school while still in ns (get student card) but you will still start school after ord with the rest of cohort,btohqsg
i think i mixed up early matriculation w/ early admission oops,btohqsg
early admissions is not early matriculation,btohqsg
but yeah this one is right,btohqsg
Its not that far the bus stop to the school,btohqsg
Like you cut under the block is faster,btohqsg
It isnt as bad as it seems its way nearer than one of my prev sec sch,btohqsg
hello  any NUS CS seniors here with SWE track? wanna know your module path!,btohqsg
"Not a CS senior  but you can check outhttps://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cugresource/per-cohort/cs/cs-20-21/  search for the words ""Satisfy at least one CS Focus Area""",btohqsg
Basically the modules in the table are compulsory  except for the CS focus area  which you can choose which modules you wanna take. One of the focus areas is called software enginnering  and you have to clear 3 modules in the Area Primaries  with at least one module at level-4000 or above. The modules are herehttps://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/focus/#SWEngrg. You can also hope onto nus mods to see their prerequesties,btohqsg
is there like a timing hehe,btohqsg
Isnt as bad as it seems,btohqsg
Small rpob is the sch treats 1 sec late the same as 5+ hours late which i definitely dont agree with,btohqsg
Just take MC if ur gonna be late,btohqsg

Guys  may I ask a question not related to academics here?,btohqsg
I have a question  I'm quite expressive when I speak but when I start to sing I am extremely monotonous (imagine 2000's mixtape/Thank Me Later Drake)  is this normal?,btohqsg

No surveys please  try sending in#surveysat our discord instead,btohqsg
Somebody sent a survey that's since been deleted,btohqsg
No point getting late coming when you can have a day off,btohqsg
but still need take train then LRT,btohqsg
Bus stop is nearer than LRT stop iirc,btohqsg
Yeah like what the other dude said  bus stop is way nearer,btohqsg
Personal opinion cause if you can easily catch up with studies or have the materials to do so  then it would make sense to fake an mc and keep your conduct in check rather than coming a minute late and being marked as late as someone who comes in the afternoon,btohqsg
but isn't like every school day important in JC?,btohqsg
like you can't afford to miss out on school,btohqsg
Closer to exams  the lessons will start to focus on revision instead of new content,btohqsg
So you might want to skip school to study yourself instead,btohqsg
Adding on to john's statement which is true  there are definitely people who can afford to skip a day or two however those people compensate by either being fast learners or studying by themselves at hone,btohqsg
Its like a cost vs benefit kinda thing you gotta weigh yourself,btohqsg
Like what john said  if it is near exam period where its just revision and you come late  for some it is better to sleep in then study at home,btohqsg
then like what time usually dismiss in JC,btohqsg
After jc2 mid year might as well donâ€™t go school already lol,btohqsg
And sch keeps scolding me for not doing homework=my unnecessary stress,btohqsg
If you choose a messed up combi 5pm without cca. If you choose a standard pcme/bcme its about 1pm or 2?,btohqsg
pcme most days also until 6,btohqsg
so messed up means not pcme and bcme?,btohqsg
some normal combi classes can end damn early,btohqsg
timetable shouldn't be a consideration when choosing combi at all,btohqsg
so I have like a judgement,btohqsg
then school start what time worh,btohqsg
Messed up as in super super unconventional,btohqsg
Typical arts stream probably end at the same time too,btohqsg
