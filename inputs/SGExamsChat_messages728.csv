Like I have what I wanna write in my head,btohqsg
But I can't think of how to transcribe it into words.,btohqsg
ok sorry as in we just ended week 9 so,btohqsg
week 10 is a good time for me to start,btohqsg
yea that one can't help it la but my only experience is with reports which is a lot more concrete and easy to plan out,btohqsg
for 4y right  it is the first time i actually hv an afternoon slot for this exam,btohqsg
just plan out in maybe 30 mins to an hour,btohqsg
rest of the time i just type non stop,btohqsg
morning slot i really cannot...like reporting at 7.45,btohqsg
wtf all my exams have been afternoon,btohqsg
i was referring to just 1 particular exam half of the cohort is in the morn the other half is in the afternoon,btohqsg
hmm try to find a way to appreciate it in some way or find relevance to smth you wanna do,btohqsg
dragging yourself through 2 more years of mods,btohqsg
i feel like i love my internship more then erm studying,btohqsg
im approaching the 2 year mark  i can do that for another 2 years  hopefully,btohqsg
but ya i gets your advise,btohqsg
but isn't yours like the week 13 hell kind,btohqsg
im approaching the 4th year mark,btohqsg
I feel like I cannot treat it like work,btohqsg
It's like that but the stress is constant,btohqsg
but before that i need to survive another 1.5 mths first,btohqsg
Cuz essays all have to be submitted nonstop over the semester,btohqsg
like i no joke almost dropped out of my phd bc i was still too last min and the quality of research i had reflected that,btohqsg
once i started doing it a bit earlier and actually focused on the quality,btohqsg
I doing it next sem so I just biting the bullet and power thru it,btohqsg
it was way easier to hit my groove,btohqsg
I am so sick and tired of writing tho,btohqsg
actually hor it was my internship that got my passion back,btohqsg
so im happy that i did not give up or what sort,btohqsg
yeah i need to learn how to either insert procrastination in my schedule to strike a balance or start earlier so that the procrastination wont bite me in the ass during finals because i'll be prepared by then,btohqsg
Yo grandpa this popped up on my YouTube feedhttps://youtu.be/VRuPM1mXR1o?si=6KlyufavsnRmQUqH,btohqsg
my bed time was supposed to be timed 23min ago lol,btohqsg
yep yep will do  cant be riding the just pass wave for long,btohqsg
nothing wrong with that  just want something better for myself,btohqsg
yea i mean depends on your goals in the end la,btohqsg
"tbh one little thing i always did was aim to finish studying 1-2 days before the test and save the remaining days for ""practice""",btohqsg
what ends up happening is i go too slow and take the 1-2 days to finish,btohqsg
but end up still ok leh,btohqsg
honest to god i usually never do any practice before the test/finals itself lmao,btohqsg
what ends up happening is me reading the solutions and convincing myself i know whats going on,btohqsg
Like I don't print out the solution sheet at all purposely,btohqsg
And only have the question sheet and force myself to do it,btohqsg
And then after I do it I then refer to the solutions,btohqsg
thats indeed the most ideal way of doing things but,btohqsg
the self control isnt there lmao,btohqsg
try the starting earlier part first then see,btohqsg
I find that it's sometimes better to purposely make it inconvenient for yourself to force that behaviour,btohqsg
yeah honestly this is probably one situation where pen and paper would make sense,btohqsg
because if im using my ipad to do work its just a matter of logging into ntulearn and downloading the solutions,btohqsg
Yeah that's the issue lmao so I have the questions and notes and that's about it,btohqsg
I don't even have Internet access,btohqsg
Can't login to ntu learn without that,btohqsg
not a bad idea at all,btohqsg
@icedmilowhy the bots keep appearing sia,btohqsg
Are ur tests open or close book,btohqsg
I guess many ppl typing at the same time,btohqsg
Speaking of which i think one of the first few lessons  my cher saw me struggling and asked me do i still have SU left and whether the mod can be SU-ed lol coz i openly told her im here coz im forced (and just hoping for S which is 40%),btohqsg
Wah that is a skill  if i dun eat med before the exam  i will get a headache during the paperüò¢,btohqsg
Once i actually act big and tot i was feeling ok for once so i did not take any meds  then erm in the middle of the paper didnt feel well but luckily it wasnt that bad  i could still get the paper done,btohqsg
Gunmen opened fire at a Moscow concert hall  reportedly killing at least 40 people  wounding 100 and sparking an inferno.The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the attack.https://str.sg/oafiq,btohqsg
And im listening to super shy by newjeans,btohqsg
U should get the cat inside fish plush,btohqsg
lmfao..bro elitist to the next level,btohqsg
i tjink they filmed chopping a table with stacks of$50 enough to show the same mindset alr..dont need loose a $5- to show it,btohqsg
i hope they do that so i can get the $50,btohqsg
"This gives off ""Seriously  how did he get into [Raffles Institution]? Must have been a lousy school""",btohqsg
haha so funny kuro! im laughing my balls off!,btohqsg
Kuro is like a marshmallow soft in everyway and absolutely delicious when burned.,btohqsg
Yummy yummy it also bounces back when poked or eaten.,btohqsg
Hey u started the marshmallow thing,btohqsg
Hey you should make tapes about each reason.. maybe call it 13 reasons why,btohqsg
ive watched it all the way to the end  quite interesting ngl,btohqsg
dam been awhile since i ate satay cus its so ex now,btohqsg
Trying a new chicha flavour today,btohqsg
yea i saw that  whats even worse is russia (putin) ignored advisories given from both the US and UK about incoming terror attacks in moscow. citing they were illigitamate false warnings,btohqsg
for not only the US but also UK to both give the same warning is not a false flag,btohqsg
now ppl are saying..putin bout say there are isis members in ukraine,btohqsg
no lah but the 1 at kovan went from 80c to 90c per stick bruh,btohqsg
i miss back then was 50 or 60,btohqsg
i thought this happened to a hdb flat,btohqsg
putin said that ukraine supports nazis,btohqsg
because zelenskyy and trudeau were applauding the russian resistance soldier in the canadian parliament,btohqsg
turns out that guy worked for the nazis,btohqsg
so that gave him great evidence to convince people that the quote on quote ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù is to denazify their neighbour,btohqsg
"@chemcer's ""special military operation"" to ck",btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I recommend Treatsure lo  I just go to a hotel buffet that has satay I can put in like 20+ sticks in my box and there‚Äôs still room for a lot more other stuff. Each stick can cost like less than 30 cents assuming I allocate half the box space for satay. But also it depends on how much leftovers are there at the end of each meal slot  sometimes there‚Äôs only a few satay left.,btohqsg
Omg I didn‚Äôt know that song was by newjeans lol‚Ä¶.i keep hearing it here and there,btohqsg
Did u go to the Nike show,btohqsg
Imo the hotel with the best satay I ate is feast Asia at grand mercure roxy  their chicken and lamb satay was rly good,btohqsg
ya js like how my 90¬¢ milo became 1.10,btohqsg
Ngl I always thought he was doing some other course in Uni,btohqsg
So Econs is the 2nd major?,btohqsg
Is that a fact or opinion,btohqsg
Yeah but I thought the 2nd degree has less modules required than the 1st,btohqsg
there's a diff between double major  double deg  and second major,btohqsg
Oh ok I must have mixed it up with double major,btohqsg
Wait isn‚Äôt double degree = double major,btohqsg
a double major is still one degree with two diff areas  usually with some overlap so the workload is less than a double deg,btohqsg
double deg is straight up two degs,btohqsg
So like 124 units x 2? And from different faculty?,btohqsg
iirc you can look at it this waysingle major: 1 scoop of icecream on one coneSecond major: smaller scoop of icecream that isnt as big as 1 single scoopdouble major: 2 scoops of icecream on the same coneDouble degree: 2 ice cream cones with 1 scoop each,btohqsg
both double major and double deg involve satisfying requirements of two majors but double deg is really like taking two separate programmes together,btohqsg
Then double major is most likely within same fac right,btohqsg
Wah bruh that is an insane workload,btohqsg
also second vs double major definition can differ by uni but typically second(ary) major is less weightage,btohqsg
ntu business and accountancy is a double degree,btohqsg
@kohsyanis this right cause i think im gonna use this analogy if my friends ask,btohqsg
then there's double degree business and accountancy with second major in entreneurship,btohqsg
I actually did not know entrepreneurship has a major,btohqsg
some stuff only available as a second major or minor,btohqsg
Oh yea like pharmacology has a minor offered together with biomedical science in ntu,btohqsg
then taking a minor is toppings ah,btohqsg
yea then second major is smaller scoop of icecream,btohqsg
As a second major it's quite popular as its open to all,btohqsg
I saw that nus lifesci has botany minor,btohqsg
If you take the lifesci. Major you will prob be able to read that right,btohqsg
I read through the module list for lifesci,btohqsg
if you like that you can go for it,btohqsg
There's like econs n maths tgt,btohqsg
I may consider that if got good enuf rp iclüíÄ,btohqsg
anyway if you wanna take a minor you just declare in the middle of your undergrad,btohqsg
it's not smth you gotta figure out from the start,btohqsg
And usually if u wanna do that  most people take the electives under their minor they wanna take to double count,btohqsg
will employers know the uni mods you took,btohqsg
No u just apply via the transcript so nope,btohqsg
cause like lets say ppl take cs but not everyone read the same mods,btohqsg
The transcript have the modules u take my bad,btohqsg
I actually think maybe it is more relevant to courses without a fix structure coz some courses have specialisation u choose in y3/4,btohqsg
not really. cause each degree on its own has unrestricted mods mah. So each degree all my unrestricted mods all taken up by the other degree. There‚Äôs a lot of double counting. Even a few core mods like a math mod i take for eee can count for econs lol,btohqsg
ngl ive only met 1 other person who likes bio but doesnt want to do med,btohqsg
Double degree u dunnid take UE twice right,btohqsg
But the number of unrestricted mods for each degree is still not enough so im still taking 5 years,btohqsg
nope  ue for eee taken up by econs. ue for econs taken up by eee lol,btohqsg
"like all the americans i see on r/chanceme doing bio are doing ""premed""",btohqsg
Huh your double degree is 5 years?,btohqsg
I think it is a bit too much of a workload to squeeze into 4y bah,btohqsg
My degree plan is like 155 AUs but that's just me and my admin says I crazy one,btohqsg
What do you mean it is crazy,btohqsg
I tot normal is like 160,btohqsg
NUS diff lmao we cannot SU anything other than BDE,btohqsg
Then how did u end up with that 155,btohqsg
No like is it a requirement or something u wanna do,btohqsg
Second major increases it to like 135 or smth,btohqsg
Our second major is not like double degree tho,btohqsg
Ntu it's different double deg and second major is diff,btohqsg
Wait then how did it go to 155  is it a requirement or like something of ur choice,btohqsg
To clear my minor requirements on top of second major.,btohqsg
Then +MOOC as I cannot revoke credits alr given.,btohqsg
Ahhh double degree... why u do dis sia,btohqsg
For PI u need to clear both econs and eee isit,btohqsg
i like to torture myselfi like econs,btohqsg
no need. pi and fyp clear eee side can liao,btohqsg
thinking how to electrocute peoplei like eee,btohqsg
Bruh u got a slide with your curriculum structure? Also your STARS courseload is like what 24?,btohqsg
i tried accessing it just now but for some reason now suddenly cannot access when i alr accessed it like 10 times for the past 8 months lol,btohqsg
Ah no wonder 5 years la.. if u overload by 4 can rite?,btohqsg
ntu force u min 4.5 years lol,btohqsg
plus eee acad office very reluctant to overload ppl lol,btohqsg
Idk if it's strictly enforced tho tbh,btohqsg
I mean if u clear everything liao what they gonna do,btohqsg
Make u sit there eat snake isit,btohqsg
this sem managed to persuade the office to let me overload literally one day after close of add/drop period and this is after more than a month of continuous appealing and rejecting lol,btohqsg
U need to send in form one rite?,btohqsg
with fch gpas for both in sem 1 somemore,btohqsg
I just went to my office and then get to know em can liao,btohqsg
lol add/drop period i visited the acad office at least 3 times lol,btohqsg
I visited it 5 times 1 during STARs wars the rest before add drop,btohqsg
i probably submitted the form twice  wrote in to them via email at least 5 times also lol,btohqsg
For admin actually rite they got the power to allow u to overload your maximum load + 6 AUs,btohqsg
If u wanna go above that u would have to get approval from your head,btohqsg
yeah but even admin themselves can exercise their own discretion mah,btohqsg
u give them the power doesn‚Äôt mean if student appeal they must do,btohqsg
Ya lor so u gotta personally buddy the admin,btohqsg
how. every day buy them bubble tea ah lol üòÇ,btohqsg
Not rlly la.. basically keep your word and work within the rules and restrictions,btohqsg
Oh and always tell them everything. I mean everything related to academics and what u intend to do,btohqsg
yeah so i did tell the admin if i dont overload this sem  next sem engineering math 1 and econometrics 1 the finals may clash  then these mods is a prereq to a lot of mods in either eee and econs lol. somemore econometrics 1 only offered in sem 1. so i tell them to allow me to take 1 more mod over the max so that i dont have to wait until y3 to take econometrics and basically everything else lol,btohqsg
O nvm ur name says IP,btohqsg
then only after that the appeal went thru haha,btohqsg
Wow that's a lot of reasons... I got my overload request approved by saying I just like the Prof and am familiar with his teaching style.,btohqsg
yeah eee office hard to persuade lol. i was queuing behind someone. the ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù want to change index to accommodate part time work. the admin ask that someone to show proof of his meeting with client lol,btohqsg
Eh? Mutual swop need reason one meh?,btohqsg
ehh i mean change index not swap index sorry lol,btohqsg
cause other indexes full liao so he trying to appeal,btohqsg
Oh chey. Ah that one is based on availability so it legit is not even in the admins hand,btohqsg
actually i think admin still can squeeze in people even tho stars system shows full,btohqsg
They can but even so certain indexes are legit just full,btohqsg
plus tbh i think eee very easy to squeeze lol. most mods no class part. half the ppl dont bother to attend tutorials lol,btohqsg
Yes u even have to specify the course.,btohqsg
I tried to get a clash wavier last semester,btohqsg
Didn't work and it was the dumbest reason ever,btohqsg
Dunman high ah like stated in ur user,btohqsg
Cause u also in rp chat so confused,btohqsg
yeah that‚Äôs why i wanted to overload one particular mod if not next sem the mod‚Äôs finals will clash with another mod  and both mods are also prereq to like a lot of things. also have to wait one entire year lol,btohqsg
Doesn't matter to the admin those are still students and the cap is reached.,btohqsg
Clash wavier are like damn hard to get cuz u need to liase with both ProfIt's just too much shit,btohqsg
true. i manage to slot into engineering math 1 literally one day after close of add/drop period and they slot me into fri tutorial cause that‚Äôs the only index with space available. i just go attend a tues class cause no class part plus free up my thu and fri lol. and when i went to tues class more than half the seats are empty ü§£,btohqsg
Bro so I tried to get a clash wavier as the lecture for one mod is prerecorded + there isn't even a lecture at that time. The videos are alr recorded and just release at that time,btohqsg
That mf said cannot cuz exams and tests will be scheduled at that time... like midterm and end term test,btohqsg
Anyone want to be spammed with cat pics in dms,btohqsg
I had to basically take up a 4k mod cuz he said no so I am at 21 AUs for Y1S2,btohqsg
i am damn bored and wide awake and half asleep at same time,btohqsg
walao y1 taking 4k mod liao lol,btohqsg
Including 6 hours of back to back seminars,btohqsg
I wanna follow that Prof he legit this sem does 2 mods a 3k and 4k,btohqsg
So I tried his 3k but my clash wavier cmi so his 4k lor,btohqsg
but the 4k mod no prereqs ah,btohqsg
walao u no need eat one sia lol,btohqsg
I 4h already trying very very hard,btohqsg
Run to cheers and while doing the seminar eat,btohqsg
But how do u fly here and there,btohqsg
Speaking of which there was once my lesson was at 12pm and i no time eat lunch  i actually had food in my bag but paiseh to eat and catch unnecessary attn‚Ä¶then i got really sick after the lesson (which was at 4),btohqsg
The hardest part is Tuesday tho cuz errr I have lecture morning at SS then CC3 at Arc then Tutorial at Hive then Tutorial at WKW,btohqsg
Do uni even care abt eating during lecy,btohqsg
Gimme all ur stickers in dms pls ty,btohqsg
I just eat and dun care... tbh others also do that and it's fine,btohqsg
lol reminds me of my mon and tue last sem. back-to-back lessons the arc then the hive then the arc,btohqsg
Arc to Hive in 10 mins..,btohqsg
impossible when u have road hoggers along that long corridor lol,btohqsg
Idk what was going on in my mind  coz i always sit at the back lol but prof talking very softly i scared i munch too loudly,btohqsg
I spend 4 mins just tryna to cut over those idiots with 3 ppl in a row in the NS to SS path,btohqsg
luckily this sem almost everything the hive. i only got one mod alternate weeks at the arc but no need walk too long cos from somewhere else,btohqsg
But actually how do u fly here and there,btohqsg
Just hope that the lesson end earlier lor if cmi then there's actually another way to SS,btohqsg
I did not realise the govt has not taken down this photo yet lolz,btohqsg
Oh actually my friend was giving me a ntu tour the hive damn cool sia,btohqsg
U go via the mountain at University Health Centre,btohqsg
thats epstein behind goh chok tong,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a lot of interesting photos online lol,btohqsg
Also right iswaran‚Äôs wife was once a teacher in scjc,btohqsg
Saw her in a pic with my old geog cher,btohqsg
nvm i always like to be reckless driver and just cut in front of ppl lol,btohqsg
i mean result release im still stuck at intern,btohqsg
Rp where we all curse the shit grades,btohqsg
I do that too but sometimes it's not fast enough,btohqsg
i mean thats munted compared to this photo,btohqsg
+ its a national archives photo,btohqsg
Sometimes I wish I can just push them away,btohqsg
worst case is literally walk along carpark lol,btohqsg
Yeah but I find the most headache one is WKW,btohqsg
There was once that i lazy cross road and make a u-turn coz there was massive construction then i was walking on the road and damn stressed lol,btohqsg
idk‚Ä¶run to ns bus stop take bus haha,btohqsg
Furthest pic of marina bay sands taken,btohqsg
the outline of mbs can be seen,btohqsg
Actually I asked my WKW mates before they legit just do that,btohqsg
just hope got bus come and the bus not unloading and loading 100 ppl lol,btohqsg
or red bus unloading and loading then 179 stuck behind ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
5pm onwards for the red bus if u are at SS,btohqsg
walao gaia bus stop. i literally see 4 179 double deck buses come back-to-back  front 2 full and back 2 half full,btohqsg
why did someone type an essay,btohqsg
Lmao YEAH at least the bus is there bro.. red bus just doesn't exist,btohqsg
ohhhh u were referring to a place lol,btohqsg
I seen at 6pm gaia bus stop red bus take 25 mins,btohqsg
Treatsure is an app that lets you takeaway leftover buffet food at a very cheap price,btohqsg
Bro it's just NTU free food with extra steps,btohqsg
Then feast Asia at grand mecure Roxy is one of their partners,btohqsg
Sometimes I just take the blue bus it's faster even though one big round,btohqsg
i wonder why they no system to regulate headways lol. and the funny thing is do u know that comfortdelgro is a parent company of sbst? just implement the headway regulating system from sbst for the ntu isb la. so hard meh,btohqsg
Its even worse than that they don't even have a system to differentiate the low riding high cap bus vs the coach bus,btohqsg
because the buses dont belong to comfort delgro  they belong to comfortdelgro Bus pte Ltd,btohqsg
So u cannot even do it cuz capacity varies,btohqsg
Back in my day RP ran shuttle buses from Tampines and Sengkang to RP,btohqsg
It was as bad as it sounds,btohqsg
they dont own buses or taxis..they only act as advertisments to these vehicles,btohqsg
Bro they own the buses lmao,btohqsg
cdg‚Äôs advertising company is moove media no meh  not cdg itself,btohqsg
But CDG is still a conglomerate now just fully in transport,btohqsg
Anyways at the end of the money line is just Temasek,btohqsg
ah so blame gahmen now ü§£,btohqsg
as far as i know most comfort delgro buses are privately leased from comfort delgro,btohqsg
I never say one arh I just say control perspective it's the same idiot,btohqsg
as far as i know as well comfort delgro has no command center like sbst,btohqsg
so they dont know where their buses are either,btohqsg
the ntu bus app literally tracks all the buses lol‚Ä¶,btohqsg
but i guess no one care. who will bother tracking 3 bus services and at best 15 buses together lol,btohqsg
Started by an independent group then randomly some idiot claim NTUSU,btohqsg
this person i think highlights the more major issue,btohqsg
Im not actually understanding her point of discontentment,btohqsg
which person are you referring to,btohqsg
there ºs like 3 people in that screenshot,btohqsg
I dun get the connection  like suddenly brought up that fam is not ur priority?,btohqsg
I think the key is it is a fact made known so needa plan time properly,btohqsg
