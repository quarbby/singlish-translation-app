Instead of tackling the way u did ill defineWhat kind of governance  is it authoritarian democracy  theological democracy  full athoritarian   communist?And for these type of governments id ask why is there a need for absolute trust.Is because they elected them?Is it because its the duty of that form of governmentsIs it because of xyzThen ill tackle the consequence of giving up absolute power.Is it freedom of speech  evalute pros and consIs it giving up freedom to different form of government here i would only tackle it for certain types of democraciesIs it giving up mobility ?,btohqsg
A very cause effect consequence kind of thing,btohqsg
U need to know diff kinds of governments first,btohqsg
this one my frens notes HAHA,btohqsg
English is more ur language mastery,btohqsg
Even in democracies got diff kinds of democracies,btohqsg
GP is more for u to show off ur depth of thought,btohqsg
Even even in those diff kind of democracies got diff governance style,btohqsg
Some with supreme court with more power some w parliament,btohqsg
That one i think no need memtion ah,btohqsg
can talk about the royals that kind of thing,btohqsg
But if u dont even know all this,btohqsg

now i am scared for gp tmr,btohqsg
U might want to get a good night sleep,btohqsg
For btter thought flow tmr instead,btohqsg
i might as well go study econs,btohqsg
I also have econs mid terms tmr,btohqsg
econs is on tue for me,btohqsg
Man has the entire sg map in his head,btohqsg
Wait why r u a channel,btohqsg
How can a channel be a user in another channel,btohqsg
It doesnâ€™t work in this chat for me,btohqsg
do u want me to talk as a channel,btohqsg
how abusive of me to use my project channel,btohqsg
Thanks for the ss help kek,btohqsg
suddenly i took my aâ€™s last yr,btohqsg
Y u ask wues then abandon,btohqsg
And econs h1 so much to memorise but easy but about 60 percent as much content as H2,btohqsg
about 50 perceng of all my study time,btohqsg
and math cos math is tedious and actually math is fun,btohqsg
but chem with their weird ass application questions,btohqsg
like shut up stop being so extra,btohqsg
13 reasons why i take geog,btohqsg
Yeah and they dont come out,btohqsg
I cant memorise everything at once,btohqsg
I am thinkinv should I ditch reviewing papers,btohqsg
or just do one subject at a time,btohqsg
Yall never watch the video before ah,btohqsg
Only like the shapes and formulas and definitions,btohqsg
Isnt this like naturally makes sense so just right,btohqsg
time to switch to poly before its too late,btohqsg
Can you test if I am ready,btohqsg
are u srsly staying cuz of muns,btohqsg
but u can always go urself,btohqsg
I tot mun otot go outside,btohqsg
Idk already i just review my papers and chem nth to me.oriss,btohqsg
dk what yall going on abt having to be in sch,btohqsg
heck care the school and get scolded,btohqsg
They say I need to take As for a leadership role when i am 63,btohqsg
Isok if I old u older,btohqsg
They say cambrigde gonna be strict,btohqsg
This year cos the queen died so they not happy,btohqsg
In that case Iâ€™m fossil fuel,btohqsg
The box to hold the ashes,btohqsg
I am the tree cut down to make the box,btohqsg
someone needs to knock you unconscious at a decent time,btohqsg
i used to live there bro,btohqsg
like there was literarily no clue about that and you got it,btohqsg
above ground mrt basically quite limited alr what,btohqsg
got new lines that will be above ground tho ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
plus many stations are above ground,btohqsg
but how did you narrow it down to yishun,btohqsg
cos i live there so can recognise,btohqsg
"this bot v funny ban and remove people then send ""youve been banned"" message",btohqsg
that the banned person cannot see,btohqsg
In the past I would fight you on that but currently in this present time  I agree,btohqsg
was he trying to be andrew tate ðŸ’€,btohqsg
im starting to like buses more than trains now,btohqsg
ur name says u love buses,btohqsg
Hence why my pfp is not just a ordinary bus but a more unique one,btohqsg
esp when u get on the highway too,btohqsg
bruh why am i thinking that its a KUB when it isn't,btohqsg
Donâ€™t worry that bus already gone,btohqsg
wait u mean KUB or ur pfp or both,btohqsg
I like the more older busses not the newer ones  the newer ones really suck,btohqsg
u like ur things old huh,btohqsg
I mean kubâ€™s are gonna soon be dereigstered,btohqsg
the only good thing id the charger,btohqsg
They have hit their stipulated lifespan by lta,btohqsg
well but the new bus 3 door abit,btohqsg
wonder if sg will refurbish these,btohqsg
they remake sch buses into little houses,btohqsg
would be cute if we do that too,btohqsg
Refurbishing is out of the question kubâ€™s have passed their 13 year old general lifespan,btohqsg
wait was it CDGE that are retiring quite early?,btohqsg
Fun fact: The last non-wheelchair accessible bus was removed in 2021,btohqsg
sorry but can only make them into HDB,btohqsg
A lot of the older models alr being retired,btohqsg
they usually have a sticker on it,btohqsg
Currently cdge is nearing the end  next bus to go is the kub,btohqsg
as a stationary shop or smth,btohqsg
ooo so all are wheelchair accessible?,btohqsg
time to patronise SBS transit more i guess,btohqsg
I mean 20 of them did become hotels,btohqsg
what were the ones that were non wheelchair accesible ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
All the olympians and Volvo b10m,btohqsg
I collected a compilation of gnarly bus accidents lmao  they are not those common  accidents,btohqsg
Maybe suddenly you will fear riding busses,btohqsg
i went on an airplane a week after seeing air crash investigation  with no fear at all,btohqsg
this is why you dont follow the cool kids and always sit behind,btohqsg
u fr just finding a DAMAGED BUS,btohqsg
judging from the taxi behind pre 2014,btohqsg
on top of busses  i also generally know alot about singapore,btohqsg
where do u even see the taxi,btohqsg
ooooo tell me like i just came from india,btohqsg
yall wanna feel nosltagia? guess how long these taxi were in singapore,btohqsg
we dont cling onto buses from the outside,btohqsg
THE SMELL of these taxis omg,btohqsg
yea alot of people either said it was the plastic seats if not the pandan smell,btohqsg
i rmbr taking comfort delgro the blue one to the airport all the time,btohqsg
then squeeze all the luggage in the boot also no space,btohqsg
+ the occasional ciggs smell as well,btohqsg
always see the taxis with the wheelchairs,btohqsg
btw you heard of the legend of the black taxis?,btohqsg
i know a fact about them and could explain why they are so expensive,btohqsg
1. These taxis were imported straight from america2. These are called limousine taxis  another category of taxis more suited for weddings../etc,btohqsg
recalled seeing ppl use it for wedding,btohqsg
its prob the grill and the bumper area ig,btohqsg
Random Fact: most of the mercedes and bmw you see on our roads were not built in germany. Most either come from indonesia  thailand or india,btohqsg
they still around tho  looking for the prey,btohqsg
btw yall rmb this taxi? they are all gone,btohqsg
indo thailand and india taxi ðŸ¤ ,btohqsg
all models deregistered by april 2020,btohqsg
are they as strong as hamilton crashing and continuing the race tho,btohqsg
now is the sleeker ev ones uh,btohqsg
The older toyota crown served us for 15 years  these hyundai taxis only served us for 12 years...and the next model is already in the process of being removed having only serve us for 9 years,btohqsg
i wldnt have had sat much in a toyota crown,btohqsg
these taxis are in the process for being removed,btohqsg
thought theyâ€™re built to last p okay,btohqsg
plus most cars 10+ still can work,btohqsg
just need repair here and there,btohqsg
yea  actually there is a story,btohqsg
all in the name of progression...feels like we progressing too quickly,btohqsg
"This is the story  lta trailed this bus since the mid 90s and sold it to new zeland in 2006 saying ""its not modern  lack safety""...then new zealands turns it into a schoolbus for kids.",btohqsg
do they at least sell the old cars,btohqsg
but occasionally they do sell them to overseas private sellers,btohqsg
anyone got ans for todayâ€™s n level amath paper2,btohqsg
Always end up puking in a bag or if not so lucky  in the cab,btohqsg
I've heard the model changes are also due to increasingly stricter requirements on fuel usage and fuel type,btohqsg
Heard from someone who was ex-comfort delgro,btohqsg
hi how to die from econs guys,btohqsg
Is it better to do a levels paper now or prelim papers,btohqsg
But my schools tut are a level questions,btohqsg
If A level papers are too easy,btohqsg
or do prelim papers that are A level standard,btohqsg
Someone help me choose sleep or study,btohqsg
sleep then wake up early and study,btohqsg
yes what i was looking for,btohqsg
Anyone knw how to memorise for geog with like nothing inside the brain in like a week :/,btohqsg
Subject specific. My belief is that for maths  do primarily prelims while doing a bit of TYS. There are some good questions in the TYS  but majority are easier.For Physics  do primarily TYS because the database questions are more well set. There are also more graph questions.,btohqsg
guys will attendance affect scholarship chances? i feel studying at home is more productive instead of going to school just to go through a few questions,btohqsg
most likely yes cos for the interviews i went with my friends some got rejected simply cos the interviewer thinks they may not be fully committed to the course cos of their attendance,btohqsg
I look at that 2.4K pages,btohqsg
As over then no more geog,btohqsg
i have 800 words to memorise by heart,btohqsg
and 3 chapters of a book to summarise,btohqsg
people out here burning the midnight oil on n levels...and im here developing a roblox city,btohqsg
ok so how to i cram p geography all by next week,btohqsg
got amath p2 qn ppr ?,btohqsg
now we are waiting for SEAB to scan the paper to us,btohqsg
I mean SEAB to scan the candidates answer to us,btohqsg
idk exactly but I roughly know what they tested,btohqsg
QNS:#1: Surds (find value of a  b and c)#2: Î¸ is an acute angle  cotÎ¸=8/15  find cosec2Î¸#3a: find dydx by product rule and find the value of _the letter_ (i forgot)#3b: explain why x=2 is an Inflextion point and determine the nature of the other turning pt (I got x=-4/3 and max pt)#4a: factorise xÂ³-kÂ³#4b: factorise (I forgot the exact expression)#4c: xÂ³-kÂ³=(forgotten expression)  eqn has only 1 real root  (I forgot what they ask us but I rmb it's 6m)#5a: using 3Î¸=2Î¸+Î¸  show that (trigo expression #1) = (trigo expression #2)#5b: find roots of (trigo expression #2)=(a number I forgot) [There are 3 solutions within the range btw]------------------------------------[Qn6  problem solving qn]: water freeze and turn into ice  (dydt) [I thought this was rate of change at first lol]#6a: given that dydt=(this)  find y in terms of k#6b[ice is safe to stake on at (I forgot depth distance)] :ice was initially at 1cm ice was (forgot another depth dist) at (this time) find the time when it is safe to skate on the ice--------------------------------Qn7 [this one legit santa clause give us 8m]: y=(smth)  2 x values are given  tangent at x= these 2 points meet at point P  find point P (intersection pt)#8a: show that the line does not intersect/touch (can't rmb) with the circle#8b: find the coordinate of a point from the line that is closest the circle and find the shortest distance between the centre coordinate and that pointQn9 (another giveaway)#9a: show that (x-4) is a factor of (expression; f(x))#9b: solve for f(x)=0#9c: I forgot but I think it was another eqn and then I had to link it to f(x) and solve it#9d(idk aso actually): explain how many are there In the 3rd eqn (basically the 1st eqn but replace x with sinÎ¸),btohqsg
I give u all chance only,btohqsg
Iâ€™m just interested in the circles qn,btohqsg
heard many student found it hard,btohqsg
I thought you donâ€™t have qn ppr,btohqsg
Urmm for circle what they said was,btohqsg
There was two points on the circle X=3 and 5,btohqsg
Then the tangent at the points will intersect at point P,btohqsg
ok that part v ez but what about the other part,btohqsg
Next question was find. Length of point P to centre of circle,btohqsg
I put infinite solution for 9d cos no range given HAHAH,btohqsg
in a nutshell: p2 was easy to the point that even I can do it,btohqsg
what was the hardest qn iyo,btohqsg
but is just that the question u all nvr see before,btohqsg
ye for o lvl students it should be very easy,btohqsg
but that trigo solving qn was the tricky one in p1,btohqsg
OK ah. need to think harder,btohqsg
"basically I simplified the expression to...(sinÎ¸-4)(sinÎ¸+2)(sinÎ¸+8)=0I wrote""since there is no range given and trigonometric graphs are infiniteTherefore  there are infinite solutions""",btohqsg
that mhm was not meant for this,btohqsg
cos they asked how many solutions,btohqsg
you sure no domain given ah,btohqsg
I shud have wrote 3 roots sia but idkzzz,btohqsg
"they js asked ""number of roots"" oni",btohqsg
I dowan say anything until I see qn HAHAH,btohqsg
actually won't share the paper here.,btohqsg
Is getting fat from project work normal,btohqsg
taking H2 math make me fat.,btohqsg
just vectors a bit jialat rn,btohqsg
took me 2 years to understand,btohqsg
you need emb3 <12 and all grade 3 or above right,btohqsg
I mean next year if u go sec5 can eae also rite,btohqsg
yep ik I was from na,btohqsg
it's another hard thing to do,btohqsg
all the interviews and the writing,btohqsg
I mean honestly I feel like q ok ah if u go sec5.. js try eae den average C5 can alr,btohqsg
you have a course in mind?,btohqsg
sec1 NA to sec 2 exp,btohqsg
then you can afford to lose a few marks here and there,btohqsg
I mean like if ur eae cfm less stress mah.. me rn,btohqsg
I can get <12 for emb3 but not all subjs <B3,btohqsg
I almost went to Sec 2NA tho,btohqsg
got one sec 5 student get 7 points l1r5 yk,btohqsg
english  art and all those subjs are more subjective imo,btohqsg
I think that sec 5 class average was 18 l1r5,btohqsg
ye I donâ€™t like art and dnt and stuff HAHAHA,btohqsg
I barely passed dnt in sec 2,btohqsg
share qns when you get qn ppr ah,btohqsg
I got C for N level I happy liao,btohqsg
the trigo graph question for P1 is pretty much similar to 2015 p1 question,btohqsg
reminds me of an o lvl qn,btohqsg
or was it a prelim qn I forgot,btohqsg
I rmb I saw this type of qn somewhere before,btohqsg
ye but I saw on a prelim ppr before,btohqsg
I think part (ii)(b)is l = pi/2 - k?,btohqsg
you got the qn ppr alr,btohqsg
itâ€™s gna be afternoon in 9 mins,btohqsg
but I haven't receive the paper yet,btohqsg
maybe cher not in sch today,btohqsg
N level A math as for now,btohqsg
I cant do the part 2b eh,btohqsg
x = pi/3 or x = 2pi/3,btohqsg
need alot of visualisation about it,btohqsg
slot student struggle cos this question nvr really come out before.,btohqsg
wait i still dont get it,btohqsg
When they want us to describe shaded area can we say it is the distance for deceleration or must we say when the speed decrease?,btohqsg
yes there is no need for working,btohqsg
just manually find m and l,btohqsg
diff between y coord at pi/2 and k,btohqsg
but you are required to find,btohqsg
damn I thought this one is just eyeing type of qn,btohqsg
5+2 = 7 5-2 = 3,btohqsg
just focus on difference of y-coord at pi/2 and k,btohqsg
if let say y= cos 2x,btohqsg
then see the diff in y-coord at L and 0,btohqsg
5- 3cos 2x = 7-3 cos 2x = 2cos 2x = -2/35 - 3cos 2x = 3-3 cos 2x = -2/3cos 2x = 2/3,btohqsg
