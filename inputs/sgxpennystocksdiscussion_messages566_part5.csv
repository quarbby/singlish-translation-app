"🚀Pika World Update- 2 Nov 2021🚀🍏Will We See Good Times Ahead?🍎Equity indexes have rocketed in October even as supply constraints continued to hamper many company's earnings as they failed to meet sales goals. Moreover  cost pressures built up  which dilute margin. Finally  the expected upward movement in bond yields may push equity valuations to the lower end.Yet  historically  the best 3-month period for stocks is often from November onwards. According to past data  the S&P 500 and Dows have typically gained an average of 3.4% during these 3 months.It could also be a seasonal trend since people tend to pump into investment account during the end year as they tend to contribute to their IRA account at a single shot which typically means flowing money into the stock market. Likewise  in January  we do see substantial contributions from the employers too.Pika World is hopeful of a volatile but profitable quarter ahead.🚘Tesla: Politics in Place🚖As Pika World has often spoken about the intertwined of politics into the economy  it seems to play out in Tesla although the impact may not be that significant.On Sunday  Elon Musk tweeted on President Biden as a ""Puppet for the United Auto Workers. This is in response to the proposed tax credits for EV cars  which are given only for cars assembled by unionized labour  which would have excluded Tesla  giving other EV cars an advantage.Ford and General Motors are likely to be beneficiaries of the bill proposals depending on which plant manufactured the EV cars. We have seen the clash between Tesla and Biden administration. Notably  the administration did not invite Tesla  the US largest EV producer  when he annonunced his grand goal of having 50% of the cars sold in the US be electric in August.As of this stage  the conflicting behaviour has not affected Tesla stock price  and Pika World is mindful of future development that may have a material impact on the company. Accordingly  we maintain exposure to Tesla as always.💎XPeng: Persistent strong performance💎Chinese EVs are gaining traction in the market as XPeng delivered solid results for delivery compared to NIO. NIO had only delivered 3667 vehicles which is a drastic fall from 10 628 in September.XPeng made remarkable progress as they delivered 10 138 vehicles in October  the second consecutive month that registered more than 10 000 cars. On the other hand  Li Auto  a rival  delivered 7 649 cars  increasing from September.The result paints a shocking picture of how competitive the EV market is in China. Pika World is looking into further entry into Chinese EV stocks.📮What's on the Menu Today?Today is a light data day  and we hope the market will have a smooth sail.It is 2 Nov  Tuesday  at 7.05 am in Singapore and 7.05 pm in New York. The first trading day has been a good one as we took profit on several positions  and we hope for a splendid week!",btohqsg
