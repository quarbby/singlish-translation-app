I feel it’s reasonable if it includes bleeding of the brake fluids cos that’s an important step. Plus I suppose u are bring your own parts to change?,btohqsg
Sell before coe up  or sell after renew.,btohqsg
I feel the basic member is sufficient  I personally don’t like the fuel credits because no credit card rewards  and the discount difference is marginal.But the Kinto lounges are good. And the free tyre patching services,btohqsg
Bleeding means clear out the brake fluid and top up new one?Yes bought own parts to change,btohqsg
Yes. That takes up a bit of time,btohqsg
My general rule of thumb is about $80 per hour of labour  but not sure if that’s really the market rate or budget around here,btohqsg
So in my theory  2 hr job   160-180 is not a lot,btohqsg
what do you want to know about it?,btohqsg
Charges me additional $60 including the oil. Think should be fine,btohqsg
Typically when u bring your own parts they charge higher for labour,btohqsg
Yah understandable. But I think we can have our own options on parts. I paid 450 for all the parts. From Japan,btohqsg
Ya usually will still have savings compared to direct,btohqsg

"The General Insurance Association has launched a new service that allows car owners to purchase accident reports online for their cars in the past six years.The General Insurance Association of Singapore (GIA) launched a new online service on Wednesday (February 21)  allowing car owners to purchase accident reports for their cars over the past six years.This means that someone looking to buy a used car can ask the owner to purchase and produce a report to better understand how many accidents the car has been involved in over the past six years.Ho Qirong  chief executive of the General Insurance Association of Singapore  said  ""This is the first time that car owners can view the accident report of their car. After the launch of the new service  both sellers and buyers can conduct transactions more intelligently.""Each report is priced at $90 (including gst).",btohqsg
For a layman info sounds very biased lol,btohqsg
Car model population size (vezel  altis  other popular daily cars) demographic of driver (like civic fd  lancer  scirocco),btohqsg
its not a good representation of safety of the car,btohqsg
Isn't it the report for that one particular car,btohqsg
so its just for that particular unit?,btohqsg
if that one isnt it enough to just google the license plate see whether come out on sg road vigilante before,btohqsg
That is what I understand from the statement  cause why would I pay $90 for the general record of accident of my car brand. I think more for that one car history,btohqsg
yea i was reading from this chat 2 diff story so was confused,btohqsg
If the car got captured in sg vigilante then ok  I think is more for those minor accident where the previous buyer got claim from insurances,btohqsg
Then theres also the load of small little carpark accidents that go unrecorded,btohqsg

If got claim then they will record,btohqsg
Why cat E lower than cat B,btohqsg
I also trying to find the link lol,btohqsg
wah first time i see E lower than B,btohqsg
This means that someone looking to buy a used car can ask the owner to purchase and produce a report to better understand how many accidents the car has been involved in over the past six years.,btohqsg
I suppose you have to get the current owner to buy on your behalf,btohqsg
Some may not even be reported,btohqsg
By right claim or no claim  supposed to report,btohqsg
Yea from my understanding  since the ones worth claiming would have to be significant which also may have been reported online publicly like sh road vigilante anyway,btohqsg
So why would i pay $90 when i can google search and find a good amt of those reports anyway,btohqsg
Wonder if seller would spend the money,btohqsg
But they can always include it in the car price,btohqsg
So I guess more useful if direct seller,btohqsg
Probably not. Thats why direct buyer would have to ask the direct seller to purchase,btohqsg
I assume the direct buyer would have to reimburse,btohqsg
I dont see why the direct seller would be reluctant to do so if they are very sure there are not accident claims ... buyer willing to pay the $90,btohqsg
Pls read the 'disclaimer' and FAQ. Frankly  it doesn't cover 100%. Nothing was mentioned who are the 3rd party organisation that GIA is gathering the info.,btohqsg
Yah for the unit you wanna buy  like a ppi,btohqsg
Doesnt cover but any major ones would mostly be covered i guess. Esp those that are claiming insurance for the repairs,btohqsg
Yah given the high risk of dubious background for a car  if come back clean sheet then more compelling to buy,btohqsg
That money i’d rather just pay for PPI and see what they can dig up from the car condition be it engine or body panels like gaps / paint uneven etc,btohqsg
Not a replacement but more of a complement,btohqsg
Back to near pre motorshow level,btohqsg
Yeahhh. If direct seller die die dont want to purchase even with your reimbursement  its a red flag,btohqsg
Yah  to see if there's any signs of major repair that wasn't reported,btohqsg
Would be very helpful if one can buy directly. Like enter car plate and pay directly,btohqsg
"Then dealers would find it very hard to claim 'Accident free""",btohqsg
Lol cos buyer dun wan accident car,btohqsg
Got some formOf accident before one,btohqsg
The thing is  GIA only captures those who have reported. Those that do not report  will not be captured in the system. Though insurers always encourage motorist to report the accident regardless of claiming or not.,btohqsg
I read that in China cars that kena bumper damage not considered accident car cos the frame not impacted,btohqsg
i was also surprised at the bidding today. prices such as 130k have become such a norm,btohqsg
They use penalty if didn't report  but if both sides coop  how would they know rite,btohqsg
Yup. Both sides really hush hush and private settle  it would not be captured. Insurer does encourage ba to always report the accident even if private settling. To protect the car owners,btohqsg
That's why fender bender small dents private settling will go unrecorded. But if say boot dent in etc... unless the person who caused the accident is super well off  then it might not be recorded. ie  person caused the accident offered a high amount of money to settle privately,btohqsg

Since she bidded  137k   then why still 97k ?,btohqsg
Final coe price is based on the lower end of the bids that are within the quota i believe,btohqsg
someone else can confirm the specifics,btohqsg
If got 100 quota  and 150 bid  will take the price of the 100th bid + $1 instead of 150th,btohqsg
Maybe election coming soon   the government hears all those who want t to buy cars,btohqsg
can alr see with budget 2024,btohqsg
They will give more out of the budget,btohqsg
Eg 100 bids all bid 90k n above.. 101th ranked bid plus $1 is the coe price,btohqsg
Lucky the system shut her out,btohqsg
Else she would have priced many others out,btohqsg
Like that is good for all the cat B,btohqsg
but she won the bid right?,btohqsg
BMW Group Asia sees record-breaking sales results in 2023Vietnam and Indonesia are said to have achieved 50% and 38% growth in BMW sales year-on-year respectively.➡️ Read itHERE!Why not SG? 🧐,btohqsg
Yah cos the winning bid is below hers,btohqsg
Then AD will need to refund those who bid for guaranteed coe,btohqsg
Can request those who bid for coe all put $1 . Then when it close   it will be $1,btohqsg
No ba  cos their rebate would have been between 50k to 60k as per market rate during that period,btohqsg
$2  cos will add $1 to closing bid. And that is if govt doesn't charge bidders for market rigging 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Nvm 3 more bids left (or 5?),btohqsg
They will continue till their bid ended,btohqsg
Lol that is if they made it  cos after today's close close shave to 75k  next round sure sky rocket,btohqsg
I wanna ask.. for this  the car dealers can actually collect $137K from the customer but only put in $97K to bid right?,btohqsg
Bid success then walk in ad,btohqsg
Don’t understand why ppl want ad bid for them,btohqsg
Cause people don’t have 100k only have 50k :(,btohqsg
You/dealer will put 10k deposit to join the bidding exercise. can choose to bid any amount.Only need to pay the difference (ie winning coe bid - 10k) when you use coe to register the car,btohqsg

Eh can I get an opinion on something  I just bought a 2nd car.. 3 years old.. from an agent.. 1 week after I collect the car  the car plate LED got issue  followed by the engine oil.. I thought these kind of servicing should be done by the agent before they sell the car to us? I bought Opel  from an Opel agent,btohqsg
Now I’ve to send it back to Opel service Center  which will consume the last free maintenance that I have with this car,btohqsg
Go China and come back a few times,btohqsg
impressive given how high performance it is,btohqsg
unless it says so in the sales agreement there is no obligation for a seller to change the oil or do any service work to a car. the default is the car is sold 'as is' unless stated otherwise,btohqsg
Nope. They just buy in the car at whatever condition it was,btohqsg
I have similar issue  bought 2nd hand car from the AD. Mentioned 140 check or smth but less than a month after driving it home  notice loud sound from the driver side tyre. Call them and identified the issue as wheel bearing. They told me their T&C no cover wear and tear  so must pay to change.,btohqsg
When they sell you  they describe the car condition like heaven. But after you buy and notice problem  they will show you some small T&C in the sales document to say that xxx is not covered.,btohqsg
Just smth that we have to bear as resale buyer 💩,btohqsg
the ppi money can buy a wheel bearing lol,btohqsg
The ppi like quite useless. How they going to check the engine n gearbox? Take them out dismantle n visual check?,btohqsg
This is like saying health checkup useless. It'll catch some stuff  not all...,btohqsg
Actually Visual check I also can,btohqsg
I think I can do a better job,btohqsg
I asked the some ws abt ppi. They say they can’t guarantee the most impt part ie the engine n gb will continue work after ppi.,btohqsg
They only check if there's any leaks?,btohqsg
Same as saying health checkup more expensive than seeing a doc,btohqsg
They say they will try their best to provide eye power,btohqsg
what wheel bearing you getting for PPI money?,btohqsg
What gearbox rebuild are you getting for PPI money,btohqsg
Just like sienta is a budget phv car lol,btohqsg
