PSA: last call to redeem your amaze Instarem points for cash rebate before it mutates into lousier points. 10th March 2025 the cash rebate option poofs!,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I am planning to try to go for miles. Currently I am using my uob one card for my public transport and utilities bills. Is the best alternative now the choco fin debit card now please?,btohqsg

Hi gurus  for the HSBC EGA giro setup  how long does it take for the application? And the 1% giro cashback is it capped? I have a $15k crmc cc bill that is due this month  so I'm wondering if I could get 1% =$150 back by setting up the EGA giro. Thanks!,btohqsg
3 weeks. Yes  $300/$500 depending on what customer tier. Too late for your CRMC bill unless you setup 1 month ago.,btohqsg
hello gurus  may i ask if anyone using cardup to pay monthly rent? seeing mixed info of whether the MCC will be applicable for miles. if can earn miles  which cc to pair with to get optimum return? thanks!,btohqsg
I think around 2-3 week from start to end. Question is  is your statement out already?,btohqsg
Guys if i want to clear out my UOB for the new promo  must i make it zero or just need to take out 150k for a month and put back 150k when Q2 promo is in?,btohqsg
So it's really uncapped 1%? Ya. I stumbled onto this EGA a bit late  but got other cc expenses which add up to 10k,btohqsg
Ok. Mis-read! Thanks for the clarification,btohqsg
Where can I done this ?,btohqsg
Very strange is I send the giro form to uob n hsbc informed me giro setup is completed. This mean uob had sent the form to hsbc  But latest uob statement still show giro not yet setup.,btohqsg
Yes. They will SMS  but not completed. In fact  they will SMS completed if failed due to x reason.,btohqsg
Do you guys encounter errors when you add a credit card to Google pay? The error is pls contact your bank for further verification. How to solve it? ThanksMy credit card is uob preferred platinum visa,btohqsg

Any sign up bonus for UOB PPV? Looking at singsaver seems like not a lot of sign up perks these days,btohqsg
Not often has signup for uob ppv if ever,btohqsg
Was thinking of waiting if that‚Äôs the case I will just go ahead and apply,btohqsg
Consider uob prvi first if new to uob.,btohqsg
Yeah‚Ä¶ was thinking of asking this question. New to UOB so should I just sign up a card that has good sign up bonus and then sign up PPV to take advantage of the ‚Äúnew customer‚Äù,btohqsg
Omg why Maybank family and friends card cannot be added to goggle pay?üò±,btohqsg
Is it worth it to get this instead of the UOB privi miles as a new customer?,btohqsg
I don't usually recc this cuz it's premium card. If you can afford  go ahead. Remember 654$ AF is not waivable,btohqsg
So all Maybank card cannot be added to Google pay?,btohqsg
All AF for 120k credit cards are not waivable. Except for CIMB Visa Infinite but I dont see their benefits good,btohqsg
I'll take free 3x dragonpass. Useful at Japan airports.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  after redeeming instapoints for SGD in wallet  anyway to transfer the $ to a bank account?,btohqsg
If you are travelling alone  the dragon pass will help. I usually travel with my wife and I feel the benefit of lounge access does help whether for food or rest. So I got citi prestige and willing to pay for the AF. Anyway I use the card to collect miles as well.,btohqsg
currently no but there may be coming 10 mar,btohqsg
Better redeem your instapoints soon because coming 10 Mar you cannot redeem instapoints for SGD.,btohqsg
Only have 920+‚Ä¶ what is the best way to get to 1k?,btohqsg
Spend until get the remaining to reach 1k?,btohqsg
Dun tell me got to go JB and spend 70+ SGD?,btohqsg
Any other way besides going overseas‚Ä¶ zzzz,btohqsg
you just need to spend in fx... no need to physically go overseas,btohqsg
Subscribe to some online websites like ... üòÖ,btohqsg
Spend S$70+ worth on online shops with delivery service to Singapore in their currency,btohqsg
Do you think it‚Äôs worth paying the annual fee for uob pivi miles for that 20k miles?,btohqsg
Wondering if possible to shop on taobao and pay RMB instead of SGD? Will this work?,btohqsg
Yes  if able to pay in RMB on website/using Alipay. I don't trust taobao so never buy anything from taobao. Good luck.,btohqsg
I got good news for you on some of the $120k cards.If you spend $60k annually into DBS Vantage and Maybank VI  their annual fees can be waived.,btohqsg
Why incur FX fee? I tot you using Amaze????,btohqsg
That will help if you can consolidate your spending. For mine  my spending spread over a few cards for a purpose. UOB One  Trust (Household)  UOB Lady (Travel expense)  CRMC (Online)  CRMC+Amaze (Overseas shopping and dinning)  UOB PPV (Offline  shopping  dining)  Standard chartered visa signature (Insurance)  Choco card (usual excluded MCC),btohqsg
