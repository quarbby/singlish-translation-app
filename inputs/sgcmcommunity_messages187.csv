hi  would like to get some advice on getting a new car. Usually is the subsidy/rebate for in-house insurance/financing worth it (about 8k rebate for the car I'm looking at)? Or is it better to source for your own bank/insurer to get better rates?For the loan  it needs to be minimum 60k for 6 years to qualify for the rebate.,btohqsg
how much the car price? 60k loan is not a lot la for 6 years,btohqsg
car price is about 189k excluding subsidy,btohqsg
In house loan generally for people who take full loan or people who banks reject  if you can get bank loan just get bank,btohqsg
The dealer usually will also let you choose from a few of their preferred banks also other than in house,btohqsg
I see. not sure if most people take the 8k subsidy so just wanted to get some advice on the pros/cons. thanks for your help,btohqsg
Very easy to hit that mark.. loan 50% also easily 90k,btohqsg
how about the in-house insurance? are the Premiums generally competitive compared to sourcing for your own car insurance?,btohqsg
Depends on dealer  they usually won't be too demanding regarding insurance if you take a sizable loan,btohqsg
The dealer I bought my car from just let me use my own insurance when he saw the premium his one offered is at least 500+ higher annually,btohqsg
Mine just tell me penalty 500,btohqsg

Is someone apart from insured driver gets into an accident while driving  will insurance still cover?,btohqsg
In that case doesnt makes sense for new driver to name an experienced family member huh,btohqsg
Yup  if Policyholder chooses all driver coverage,btohqsg
Should the other way round but usually excess for new driver  as well as above 75  would be higher,btohqsg
Yeah but sometimes in the family have someone like my mom that has license for donkey years but never drive at all,btohqsg
Lol then use to pay parking summons at tanjong pagar 😂 but that was like in 80s,btohqsg
Excess higher as unnamed driver excess applies on top of basic excess amount,btohqsg
Hi is it listed in sgcarmart?,btohqsg
If new driver is primary driver won't help bring down quote if the experienced driver is 2nd named,btohqsg
Wah I think definitely lower than had the new driver is the policy holder,btohqsg
Thanks the primary driver would be experienced driver  plus new driver as 2nd driver. ‘New’ driver actually has driven regularly for 15 years but just hasnt been a registered driver/owner,btohqsg
Yes. Some companies will outright refuse to insure  those that willing to will charge sky high premium,btohqsg
7k premium higher than the 3k for new and young driver,btohqsg
Can dad car insurance transfer to son ?,btohqsg

If not you wait till 30s then get a car .,btohqsg
That wouldn't matter then if you have driving experience for 15 years on your license,btohqsg
You probably fit the higher age clause as well of over 27,btohqsg
In a cat A Conti or jap car,btohqsg
Cheapest excess among the cars I own,btohqsg
But that 1 I hardly drive . FIL pops over then I drive him around .,btohqsg
Wow I suspect you might need to rework your policy terms  seems too high even for a mid engined car at your age,btohqsg
The insurance parked under my FIL & I am named as 2nd driver,btohqsg
Actually is tag to car and owner or Policyholder dunno which  cos I got a car under my name but my dad is driving  to lower insurance costs and the ncd is 50  then I had wanted to get another car under my name but the insurer say will start from 0%. I.e. iirc 🤭,btohqsg
Is how the game that been play . Suffer 1 time expensive premium which most need to go through at young age .,btohqsg
"So if i transfer ""my dad's car's"" ncd to my own  the insurance for ""his car"" would be 0 ncd",btohqsg
Tag to car owner for each particular car. NCD can be transferred to new car when changing car but not for 2nd car,btohqsg
But cannot transfer to another person,btohqsg
So if you premium kanasai can pay $25 transfer car ownership to wife and let her take insurance and top-up for any driver,btohqsg
Ah that makes more sense then,btohqsg
It's tagged to owner but is limited to one car  for a second car you need to build ncd again,btohqsg
Then add 1 ownership count and price drop more😂,btohqsg
Most of my car insured will have named driver . Cheaper this way .,btohqsg
However ncd from one car can transfer to another using the ncd protector,btohqsg
But will only stay on one of them,btohqsg
22k insurance ah 😱 I'm so sua ku 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Or 2nd driver put abv 40s then can drive . Calling for valet will need to inform this as well,btohqsg
Pay excess only when you crash or kena,btohqsg
Well some people are fortunate to have loaded in laws  most of us are fortunate enough to own 1 beat up shitbox,btohqsg
But nobody else can drive except you and policy holder,btohqsg
You can always have a choice to find . That what my brother told me when I was in JC .,btohqsg
Probably something mid engined and relatively fast,btohqsg
Valet is company insurance no? They have special coverage,btohqsg
No  not that  but because of the clause in your insurance,btohqsg
Most of them ride on your insurance under unnamed driver clause and their company insurance will just cover the excess should anything happen,btohqsg
So those shady valet actually quite risky,btohqsg
Then to be safe dun ever let anyone drive your car lolz,btohqsg
A clause in the  car insurance which needs to be followed,btohqsg
And parking valet is no insurance,btohqsg
Sometimes when you touch a bit of alcohol .,btohqsg
Yah you better confirm this driver  part,btohqsg
Usually I just left the car there and next day then go retrieve,btohqsg
Else any damage is pay out of own pocket,btohqsg
That's why you might see some full loaner supercar owners parking outside mbs and sleeping in the car,btohqsg
Because they do not wish to pay for the excess or take the risk of letting a valet drive,btohqsg
But must not sit behind wheel,btohqsg
There is a way to make this more convenient by adding unnamed driver clause but your premium gao gao,btohqsg
You're in a carpark in your own car.,btohqsg
But police can catch you even if the car is not moving,btohqsg
urs is anything but a shitbox,btohqsg
The only painful issues for car insurance is - expensive while you are young,btohqsg
Not if you can prove you weren't moving off by way of showing how long the car was parked.,btohqsg
To be caught under drunk driving you need to be operating the car not seated in it,btohqsg
Or have the intention to operate while being under the influence,btohqsg
Lol aiyah just sit pax side and avoid all the hassle,btohqsg
If you open the car door   the car is consider as activated once .,btohqsg
My friend got into legal issues even when he was asleep at the pax seat . Fortunately he got a rich father to help him,btohqsg
If ignition on and seated but not moving?,btohqsg
The mg 4  once you sit inside  the car is activated lol so no start stop button in that car,btohqsg
if u are drunk  u still can be arrested even if engine is off  cus intention was there. but see how ur lawyer gna fight it in court,btohqsg

If u opt for driving schools  need to take full package,btohqsg
