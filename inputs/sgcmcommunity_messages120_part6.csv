The shop will settle for you,btohqsg
Have you ever seen sgrv use captions like HONDA DRIVER DO THIS,btohqsg
They do it purely out of the want for clicks and views as they are a monetized platform,btohqsg
And portraying cars most aspire to have as bad or stupid is an easy way to get hits,btohqsg
Posting stupid videos that make no sense also gets hits,btohqsg
But can get better selling price if the loan settle by yourself than the shop right .,btohqsg
No la settle loan is just take what you get for your car and pay off your outstanding,btohqsg
You can do it yourself also but consignment makes it easier,btohqsg
