No idea. U cant see what they do  they say what u can only believe,btohqsg
Usually during Servicing i watch my WS do. LOL. I also dk what they do at least i see them drain and change filter,btohqsg
I’ve seen real life example. After car is out from AD  owner drive the car to workshop and drain the oil out to Chk if AD do the job. Result is no!,btohqsg
Good to be from PI for servicing,btohqsg
For KM. They will remove ur car cam during servicing too Tiagong,btohqsg
Confirm they just top up the oil only,btohqsg
Every AD the same.. thats why we need sgcarmart help us debunk them lol n go behind e scene,btohqsg
This should be done really. But they may wayang when they go check them out so no factual Facts,btohqsg
Heng autobacs ubi got fish tank.. can see them drain oil,btohqsg
Yes.. autobacs ubi one got viewing corner,btohqsg
they have a body called better business buerau  better than sg CASE,btohqsg
This one they do but overbilled you on stuff you don’t need to change,btohqsg
That’s why for old bmw car I prefer to change oil myself.,btohqsg
I believe rogue ws would drag a problem that can be solved in 1 trip  then claim that's their usual practice.,btohqsg
Change to a smaller rim. Cheaper tyre 🤭,btohqsg
Less fuel used also  win win,btohqsg

Is it still viable to buy an ice car? Given that in less than 8 years no more coe will be issued  and given that hybrids or EVs consumes lesser fuel compared to an ice?,btohqsg
I still think hybrid is a good compromise. EV like Hyundai ionq 5 is fine in my books,btohqsg
Take my comments as a real pinch of salt since I am driving a car that is probably older than ya 😅,btohqsg
This car sounds like mocha coffee.,btohqsg
Hybrid is unnecessarily complex. Either gasoline or EV and not a mixed.,btohqsg
you spend more to get smaller wheels,btohqsg

These are pests. Be careful. I encountered these once.,btohqsg
You collide into them you’re responsible for their deaths,btohqsg
That poor Malaysian Chinese girl kana jail because of these pests. Can you imagine if it’s happened to a Singaporean?,btohqsg
It’s anti Chinese judgement to appease the Malays.,btohqsg
If sinkie then die in malaysia la. 😂,btohqsg
I think malaysian polis and majority know it’s wrong judgement. Even the majority of Malays know the parents are responsible for the kids reckless and dangerous behavior.,btohqsg
After 2 failed appeals by prosecutors this crazy judge caved in.,btohqsg
See how he drives 250 in the slow lane! And use the fast lane only for fast speed. 😂,btohqsg
How much is the charges for Malaysia toll at 2nd link? Anyone got any link?,btohqsg
Rm20 to go in? How about coming back to sg?,btohqsg
depend on which link you took.rm20 is road charge not toll.Toll at 1st link - rm2.37 (2nd card reader below road charger reader)Toll at 2nd link - rm3.28 - rfid (after exit kastam),btohqsg
first link don’t need to pay toll. 2nd link you need to pay the same rm3.28,btohqsg
this is for using tng card to pay. rfid is always slightly higher to recoup the installation fees.,btohqsg
from my perspective  its not unfair. u pay a bit more for convenience.if we are down to discussion on dollar and  sense. would you pay in future to have the auto window motor/button to be replaced? if you travel a lot in m’sia  maybe it will make more sense. If only go in a couple of times then maybe just stick to tng card.,btohqsg
does every toll have rfid? even the smaller ones,btohqsg
i drive ex extensive. i have never considered using rfid,btohqsg
i noticed some smaller remote ones dont have this,btohqsg
for those that dunno how big/small their car is or have short arm. you have to drive within an arm reach to the card reader  drive too close rims will strike kerb  drive too far you have to alight from the car with your engine still running. with rfid  its just like erp  drive slow and wait for gantry to open (provided you have sufficient balance in tng e-wallet),btohqsg
