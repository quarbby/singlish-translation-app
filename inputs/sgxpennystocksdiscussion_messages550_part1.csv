Taiwan’s healthcare better  good quality and almost free.. but end up  ppl will misuse them. Kena scratch also go A&E  to end up who pay? Tax payers loh..,btohqsg
Long term gains only good if the bets are correct... Is it really safe to let some parties retain power for so long?,btohqsg
Safer than getting divided focused on short term gains.Today  SG is losing traction in being a trade and aviation hub. How are we going to diversify? If we are fixated on short term  we will never address these issues; 10 years down the road  SG will no longer have the edge.I understand your perspective  and I really do. But I also think we don’t have much of a choice.,btohqsg
If any CEO of any company only looks at short term gains  would you invest in them?,btohqsg
Why not? Different investors have different aims and agendas,btohqsg
I don't see any bad points in exploring other options  other than the ones sold now. Not saying they are bad  just wondering if there are some other angles worth looking into. This also ensures check and balances  where no individual entities can profit unfairly from national initiatives,btohqsg
Investors only have one aim - earn money. If the company doesn’t have a promising future  it won’t be attractive. It’s simple as that… but sure  there’ll be some uninformed bunch that will invest them.,btohqsg
You already said short term would be good... And longer term can do structured short  right?,btohqsg
Yes  you are right. This is flaw in SG governance. And that is echo chamber and blind spots. But democratic like TW may mean that we lose the agility coming up with policies and laws..,btohqsg
True also... Got good and bad... SG's tried and tested way has been here for 50+ years... Aren't you curious how other ways would fair if tried?,btohqsg
I don’t want to spam this channel on politics  so I’ll just say one last point:If this idea of “pure democracy” is that good and perfect  why isn’t it adopted in MNCs? Why can’t the janitor vote for the CEO?,btohqsg
The way I see it  all neighboring countries around SG are growing faster than SG  and will eventually catch up... And people here don't even have a tangible opportunity to questions any strategies put in place... Is this the case of being too trustful  don't rock the boat mentality or just cannot be bothered?,btohqsg
I understand and agree there is no perfect way. I'm just not convinced yet the proposed 'shove it into your throat' way is the 'best' way.,btohqsg
I learnt from COVID  to keep trialling and testing  and evolving for best survival chance. Delta is it's most successful form now  and it is not stopping,btohqsg
See specialist for cancer also 30 Baht,btohqsg
Their doctors mostly local thais. Makes me wonder why must SG import so many doctors.,btohqsg
Can’t they just open up more intake for the medical school…,btohqsg
Make it so competitive for local,btohqsg
But then in the end still import,btohqsg
Power sia the one do the digging,btohqsg

Less international competition if you get what I mean,btohqsg
"imagine  queue long hours at the polyclinic  exposing yourself to Covid  only to get treated by a ""temp registered"" doc from an unrecognised school.",btohqsg
Let's see by next year June 2022,btohqsg
My degree not competitive. See ba. Last time was prepared go india for job,btohqsg
I thinking if got any adjacent fields for you to go to or not,btohqsg
I strongly encourage this. Go see the world and then reflect your new perspective onto SG,btohqsg
Last time try pharma go take glp gmp courses cannot get,btohqsg
How to do this ? Apply overseas?,btohqsg
Search APAC roles   filter out SG,btohqsg
Nvm now try my luck a bit,btohqsg
all the while intakes to local uni medical schools are kept small on purpose. Kind of defeats the quality argument with unrecognised uni docs in system.,btohqsg
I wonder if you can... Get into pharma companies now or not,btohqsg
What's the point... Local don't put you first,btohqsg
Lols last time i apply 6 mth plus in advance. End of the day get job le  they then come find me for interview,btohqsg
Get in touch with the countries' recruiters directly,btohqsg
Always for big companies.. need to wait 3-6 month,btohqsg
Yeah somemore must have connections in company then have netter chance,btohqsg
Or apply for international transfer if your current company has this option,btohqsg
