Which ans is correct and why?,btohqsg
usually in cases like this  it's possible to have more than one correct answer to the question when meeting the requirements needed to certain concepts of a subject,btohqsg
"unless it's a ""choose one  correct answer* type of qns with hidden traps",btohqsg
Makes sense but this deliberately said the other one was wrong,btohqsg
probably a case of not answering with unorthodox formats that isn't officially recognized by taught syllabus,btohqsg
Anyways ask in the o level chat u prolly can get faster response thr,btohqsg
Why must the positive side be facing away from the switch tho,btohqsg
if the current flow of a diagram is different then obviously it'll affect the whole set-up even if it's drawn the same as the correct answer,btohqsg
ya i know but i don't understand how exam papers and answers are leaked right after they end,btohqsg
It's not abt the switch it's more of just ur direction of current must be consistent,btohqsg
Cus tution centres will take the paper and memorise the questions,btohqsg
i understand this concept but not of those who leak the entire batch of school papers and in extreme cases  national/international exams,btohqsg
the other question was way easier for me,btohqsg
starting time depends on ur lecturer availability and sch allocated timing fr u. fr prev sem  lessons started frm 8-10am. fr this sem  lessons starts frm 9am to 2pm,btohqsg
Typical student ðŸ˜‚I used to go for classes in sec school without text booksMy bag was the lightest in class but also missing Alot of assignments,btohqsg
can be frm 10am to 6pmâ€¦ some days   u can have a 2h-4h class. fr np  we have a one day no lessons every week unless there is replacement class,btohqsg
Right now as a yr3 in rp  I got 2 days of no lessons,btohqsg
I went to sec. school just to do / discuss homework from tuition classes.Because tuition class lectures > school lectures.And Malaysia Sec. School are mostly quite bad  since teachers are somewhat underpaid  so not much resources  and teachers still teaches on whiteboard or dry talk without reference to the gov. textbooks . ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
Helloo anyone know any jobs good for students with decent/high pay,btohqsg
"what is ""decent pay"" in Singapore means now for Singaporeans?",btohqsg
i am guessing like 10 plus?,btohqsg
last time I remember someone posted about@sgIntership@sgCareers?,btohqsg
Not sure how applicable is all this:@sgCareers- Where careers start!@sgTechCareers- Be part of the next big thing!@sgInternship- Learning on the job!@sgQuickJobs- Quick moolahs into your pocket!@sgAirfarePromos- Fly cheap anywhere!@sgWhereTo- Ideas on WhereTo go!@sgFoodies- We live for food!@sgAskEveryone- Ask and learn what the rest thinks!,btohqsg
If youre young and physically capable and dont mind being tired  banquet jobs are usually decent and fast money,btohqsg
i feel crazy whenever i see a part time banquet job recruitments that say $15-$17/hr but it's based on your luck with how well you find  get and work with certain jobs,btohqsg
i still work banquet every now and then when im free and yeah its not terrible i guess  somedays you're unlucky to deal with a wedding but somedays its a reception etc,btohqsg
depends on one's ability and limits of working in a jobfor all u know  ppl want money but can't with those high paying part time jobs like banquet because of the high intensity and instructions you need to pay attention to  in one go,btohqsg
but sg banquet jobs still ok la,btohqsg
idt anything can compare with your most recent experience,btohqsg
Uhm.... yeah we dont talk about that,btohqsg
On the brightside i was paid to do nothing....not by choice,btohqsg
that's like the basic pay 20 years ago  when I was just helping to count the number of cars turning at a junction every 15 min interval.,btohqsg
That's really low  I'm sure there are jobs that pay better than that,btohqsg
I think should have people automated car counting by now I guess ðŸ˜‚ using computer vision,btohqsg
Went to service my car. Sat next to a Cambridge marker marking manually ðŸ˜±,btohqsg
Feels like Econs/English language paper for International syllabus ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I tot they marked the scan version or smth,btohqsg
"i had this question after i saw a post from this user u/busted10nuts in sgexams's reddit community""is the sexual tension between me and h2 econs normal???""",btohqsg
i thought it was clickbait but whaaaa,btohqsg

Alr iâ€™ll try it out after os thanks,btohqsg
aside from those more illegal crimes  there are jobs being advertised on tele that go against MOM (ministry of manpower) regulations like hiring underaged employees without declaring  deploying filthy ways of marketing in the job scope like convincing someone to pay one box of ice cream worth $16 over dollars for some unknown brand and tricking people to pay more than whatever they agreed to pay,btohqsg
since when has it not been,btohqsg
