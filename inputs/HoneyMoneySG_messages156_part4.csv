When will interest be creditted into esaver account? I have yet to receive. I deposited $ on 3 feb 25 and then withdraw out on 6 feb 25. By right should get 3 days interest right?,btohqsg
Wow. Effective from when? I just made one payment like 2 days ago. What alternative platform do we have for income tax and insurance now?,btohqsg
Looks like now need to reinstate all my giro back. Haiz.,btohqsg
It's always good to have giro as backup even if the nerf doesn't happen.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I would like to clarify regarding the CPF MediSave Account (MA). Once the MA reaches the Basic Healthcare Sum (BHS) cap of $75 500  can the employer still contribute to this account? Or will any excess contributions by the employer be transferred out to maintain the $75 500 limit?,btohqsg

Excess will go to SA  up to FRS. Then will go to OA.,btohqsg
Regardless own contributions or employer contributions will be transferred out to maintain the cap limit ?,btohqsg
You cannot self contribute to MA once hit BHS if you're employed.,btohqsg

Hi anyone can help. I voluntary contributed SGD 8000 to my own cpf in December 2024. Today the individual tax assessment for YA 2025 (year 2024) does not include it for tax relief.. anyone know the possible reason for this?,btohqsg
Which card to get if planning to sign up for rewards only?,btohqsg
Hi. Ha ha  did you exceed the max tax relief?,btohqsg
You mean the 80k right? Then no‚Ä¶ now my total relief only 23k..,btohqsg
Are you full time employed? How do you topup? You topup on last day in December?,btohqsg
Yes I am full time employed‚Ä¶ I top up through the cpf website where it shows how much relief I enjoy.. then after I top up it will become 0‚Ä¶ I top up and transfer Paynow on 29 Dec 2024‚Ä¶ that time already got a notice saying top up on that day still consider 2024 relief‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Sian.. luckily didn‚Äôt make a quick move to cancel other cards option.,btohqsg
Id keep your backups as long as possible.,btohqsg
If you have hit FRS in 2024  likely no tax relief. Other than that  I don‚Äôt know any other reason.,btohqsg
I see.. then seem like they missed out.. let me try and email them‚Ä¶ thanks man,btohqsg
Once you have a new cool way to earn rewards and switch over  what if it stops working after a while.Always good to have backups ready for such scenarios  especially if they dont cost anything.,btohqsg
Yeah somehow the low perks like Amex cashback are more reliable (cross finger),btohqsg
Don‚Äôt even know why ppl cancel Giro. Even if AXS didn‚Äôt nerf  this 2mmpd for sure is not here to stay.,btohqsg
UOB did not approve my credit card waiver  anyone encounter such issue with UOB?,btohqsg
Did you try calling uob cso?,btohqsg
I appeal for waiver and mentioned to UOB CS that I will cancel my relationship with UOB if not successful,btohqsg
Use to approve waiver for me a few years but now treat me like that,btohqsg
And they still said no? If so  tough luck. You may have to cancel. They dont want ur business anymore.,btohqsg

Even I have excess funds  will not place with UOB,btohqsg
You dont spend enough on uob so they dont want ur business anymore. Just move on  cancel and use ur stanchart and citi cc.,btohqsg
