May I know does anyone apply for this loan? EIR 5.43% mean of if I borrow $100k and all I have to pay is $100k X5.43% = total interest is $5430 no any other extra fee ? Am my calculations right ? Thanks üôèüèº,btohqsg
So mean my tenure is 5 years is $5430X5=$27150 ?,btohqsg
May I know what is the difference between Annual interest Rate 2.88% and EIR 5.43% ?,btohqsg
U have to pay $1907 x 12 months x 5 years$1907 x 60 = $114 420,btohqsg
The mechanics of compound interest over a period of time. So EIR is more accurate,btohqsg
2.88% is the interest rate charged on the original $100k even if u have repaid a portion of your original loan,btohqsg
So total interest I have to pay is only $14420 ?,btohqsg
EIR is effective interest rate which factors in what u have repaid.And 5.43%pa is the true loan rate u are paying over 5 years on $100k loan,btohqsg
‚ÄúOnly‚Äù?$14 420 interest on $100 000 loan which u need to repay a portion of monthly‚Ä¶. Is a lot.,btohqsg
A bit confused I borrow 100k and the total interest is $14420I thought 5 years tenure is 100k X 5.43%=$5430$5430X5=$27150 ?,btohqsg
No. Because every month u are repaying $1907 (mix of principal and interest).,btohqsg
Oh I see . Ok ok üëåüèº,btohqsg
So if u think about it.At year 2.5  actually u only owe Uob $50k but u are still paying 2.88% interest on $100k.,btohqsg
Simply just count $100k x (2.88% x 5) = $14400. That's your total interest. You'll have to pay back $114400 for the $100k loan in total. Divided by 5 years (tenure)  and 12 months (for monthly payments)  rounded up to $1907/mth.,btohqsg
