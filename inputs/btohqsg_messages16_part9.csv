No need to think about the 40% anymore  it will be History,btohqsg
In fact before Aug 2023 those not serious are already looking at resale now.,btohqsg
There is a possibility. Simply looking at 40% as a singular number is not sufficient to understand dropout rate  as a) this number is calculated at the end of selection process and does not show the trend through the selection processand b) this is indicative of average dropout across all units types and launches. So each launch and each unit type may follow a different pattern.For reference  when I tracked for my launch (non-mature)  average was about 15-17% dropout for most of the selection period  at the end of it it was 26-32% dropout rate depending on unit type.But I know there are other launches that are 20+% dropout already from the start of selections.,btohqsg
Thank you Bern for your insight!,btohqsg
Hi..when do i possibly receive my keys for blk 639A?,btohqsg
hi does anyone have any experience regarding minimum retirement sum? If im collecting my bto flat only past 55  can i tell cpf i need my cpf to pay for the bto?,btohqsg
No experience but I am guessing u may pledge your flat to make up the basic retirement sum as option.....,btohqsg
Just to add onto above inputs  as long as you continue working OA can still be used to finance your flat,btohqsg
Best to get an appointment with CPF to discuss this with them,btohqsg
when you cancel  you forfeit the deposit,btohqsg
U mean the walkway to bedroom one izit,btohqsg
Area around the toilet   assume that area expended,btohqsg
Hi everyone  can I ask if I cancelled my bto in September 2022 for my November 2021 flat  may i know when can I apply again as first timer?,btohqsg

Hi  currently I am studying and my partner is working full time. My Partner salary alone can cover the cost of mortgage.Is it possible for my partner to become a essential occupier and if so when do we declare this status. Doing so to avoid the potential future two house stamp tax.,btohqsg
Gxgx :) when you submit your flat application  there is an option for you to select co applicants  main applicant/essential occupier.Are you past that stage?,btohqsg
Yep but wasn't able to see the options of essential occupier,btohqsg
We only saw Co applicant and main applicant,btohqsg
Oh flat application as in go down to hdb ?,btohqsg
So which one did y'all pick?,btohqsg
Main applicant and essential occupier is the one you want,btohqsg
Is it still possible to change ?,btohqsg
Must let HDB officer know during flat selection that you want to change it,btohqsg
That will be the last time you can change if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
You do realize that you cant use essential occupier CPF to pay right? If you’re using cash then ok. But if you don’t have an income means you don’t have HLE either. You will have to use Cash or CPF if you have any to top up/pay for the shortfall.,btohqsg
