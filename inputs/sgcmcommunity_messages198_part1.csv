85-100k for Cat A is the new normal,btohqsg
2030 will cease selling of ICE car,btohqsg
Lol a lot of pattern can come out,btohqsg
So then whens the right time to get an ev since we have to get 1 in 5.5yrs time?,btohqsg
Good chance postponing if even simpler internal affairs like simplygo n erp 2.0 can defer many years,btohqsg
You dun have to get an EV in 5yrs time  if you dun wan to get an EV  you only can look at used car market lo 🤭,btohqsg
It's just that if you wan to buy a new car  in 5yrs time there's only EVs,btohqsg
Wasn't ERP2.0 deferred due to COVID?,btohqsg
deferred primarily due to technical and operational considerations rather solely due covid,btohqsg
These 2 are different areas  I dun think there's anything to stop 2030 unless there's no EV supply  but that is impossible looking at how manufacturers are pushing out EVs,btohqsg
Lol back to this qn  I think is when coe drop 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Or change perspective  mindset  as in look at the type e.g. EV or ice or hybrid  rather than the market e.g. new car or used car markets,btohqsg
So even if 2030 comes  you still can get a non-ev,btohqsg
Hybrid kinda pointless for my low usage ~15k/yr. The petrol saving vs the excess i paid for the car. Nt worth to get hybrid leh i calculated,btohqsg

Actually if you low usage  get petrol. If you get hybrid  should drive more. If you get EV  go few blocks away just drive 🤣,btohqsg
I feel that if get ev is most likely for the tech n new design (exterior+interior). Thats why waiting for renault n peugeot,btohqsg
Parf. The newer the better. The older the car  got more wear and tear to replace,btohqsg
I heard moudly aircon is also quite common for japanese car  so at one point need to change the condenser,btohqsg
You seach toyota mouldy smell got a few thread on it online,btohqsg
Petrol consumption like drink water .. Toyota vios good petrol last forever.,btohqsg
too bad in SG cost 10x the price,btohqsg
aus cost of living  taxes  housing  all not cheap,btohqsg
you win some and lose some  grass is not actually greener,btohqsg
Anyway I’m not complaining. The only thing is I poor. Not the car ex,btohqsg
Must balance out. COL is an issue in most cities,btohqsg
