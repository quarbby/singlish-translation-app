Yes!! That’s my goal 😂. But I guess I go with DBS altitude for the PP.  UOB pm is 4 free for individual. Nonsense..I heard pp registering is per email.,btohqsg
Pp registration is per account. All accounts can share 1 email.UOB prvi not bad. Ask ur partner/wife to register one for herself.,btohqsg
Oh so if I have DBS altitude and UOB prvimiles can sign up in 1 email?She not keen. But see how la. Combine resource to travel is nice.Btw is nice and thoughtful to share partner. I’m ok one and not those privilege people 😂 IYKYK . And I’m straight hahaha,btohqsg
I meant partner is for now  wife is for future. 😁Use dbs alt to let her experience chilling at the lounge before flight. Then can convince her to get her own lounge access card.Or work hard to get Citi prestige 💪,btohqsg

How about only FRS hit only? BHS always up/down due to pte insurance medisave deduction.How's the interest proportion out?,btohqsg
been doing $1k  lazy to track the difference if doing by $550  $600,btohqsg
If your BHS is not reached then whatever CPF will go to the MA (up to BHS) MA & OAInterest is only credited at the year end. So the snapshot is taken as of year end to decide where the interest credit will go to.(Not sure if that’s what you are asking),btohqsg
It will go to MA up to BHS before the remaining amounts go to OA.,btohqsg
hi all i am making a purchase with mcc 5047 online. would this work with my citi rewards card for 4mpd? its not a travel related transaction.,btohqsg
Top up loved one's SA/MA and get back cash from them 🤣,btohqsg
What’s the advantage of depositing ?,btohqsg
Secured to get Citi prestige/or other credit card if income is not enough.,btohqsg
How to have the money to top up to frs?,btohqsg
Sorry boss. I can't teach one how to make money. I also need lessons on that myself.,btohqsg
Is the UOB one account still desirable these days? Especially with some of the CNY promos.I have 150k to park and can fulfill the min salary $1600 and $500 per month card or saving requirement. Anything else to do to gain 4% on the 150k?,btohqsg
4% p.a. is ok ok for nowif you want the earmark promo you need to empty your account in March 2025.. and wait for April 2025 announcement.,btohqsg
what's the account monthly average balance in Dec?,btohqsg
I've never opened a UOB account before. Would be the First time. Will transfer our from DBS,btohqsg
ok then can register for the CNY savings promo if u dun mind the funds being earmarked for about 5 months. Can get 4% on the 150k by fulfilling min 500 card spend and 1.6k income crediting  and also the cashback from the CNY promo (register for the promo and have min 150k in by 31 Jan 10.30pm  maintain till earmark around 3rd-4th week of Feb).,btohqsg
My UOB one account is like a piggy bank. Only to withdraw in event of emergency. Easy to fulfill criteria.,btohqsg
Anyone on SCB Spree? All my online transactions only got 1% cashback in my latest statement. Anyone can corroborate this?,btohqsg
Is your cashback exceed $30 per statement?,btohqsg
No. I track it so it's always correct before this latest statement. This latest statement is an anomaly.,btohqsg
Oh. I can’t comment any further because I don’t have any transactions on my latest statement.,btohqsg
hi gurus.. can check is it a must to top up money and pay via ecapacita voucher to get the $5 bonus reward? Or I can pay with any other card then submit the receipt to qualify for the bonus reward?,btohqsg
Must pay with Ecapita voucher and first xx of the day,btohqsg
If u are young and still have the energy then whack both active and passive income,btohqsg
Atome should use with citi rewards right? Don’t need use Instarem?,btohqsg
Anyone tried moomoo's angbao draw?   $888 seems unbelievable to me.,btohqsg
There was dp Citi rewards not getting 4mpd for atome so I'd pair with amaze to be safe.,btohqsg
Dollardex under Singlife states there is no platform fees for unit trusts. Any idea how there are making profit then ?,btohqsg
My cashback showed all my online got 1%  and all my mobile contactless got 2%,btohqsg
Promo is real  t&c wise need to verify what conditions are needed,btohqsg
is it withdrawable CASH or is it trading credits,btohqsg
T&cs here  $888 from $2000 buy tradehttps://www.moomoo.com/sg/support/topic5_1055?global_content=%7B%22promote_id%22%3A1010%2C%22sub_promote_id%22%3A344%7D,btohqsg
I think I need to buy hsbc short duration bond $2000 then they will give me $888 cash credit to withdraw to bank? Correct me if I am wrong.,btohqsg
Better to check promo t&cs with CS to confirm,btohqsg
Hi Chris. Last Dec I put in $15.3k to my SRS account. And i park it in Endowus cash smart - -enhanced. Is this the best choice if i just want to earn 4% interest annually?,btohqsg
It's not a guaranteed 4% p.a.  just projected. If you want guaranteed 4% p.a.  CPF SA. 👀,btohqsg
i put in srs because of tax relief,btohqsg
Like Melvyn said  4% p.a. is cash smart is not guaranteed and will fluctuate in rates,btohqsg
Also there is a chance of capital loss,btohqsg
just a safe place will do...i don't anything about investing.,btohqsg
With interest rate keeps falling  I am thinking to invest in fund to boost OCBC 360 interest rate with additional 1.5%. Anybody invest in fund via ocbc ? What are charges to invest $20 000 in fund to earn extra 1.5%? What are the fund is eligible for the extra 1.5% interest rate?,btohqsg
Weird question: the SCB $500 promo only requires holding 3 months in good standing right?Didn’t see the typical min 1 year hold period like the usual Singsaver or Moneysmart promos. But ofc  cashback only be credited by May 2025 so need to wait till then to spend again.Thanks once again!,btohqsg
