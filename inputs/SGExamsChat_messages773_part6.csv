Lmao we gonna dig more? I think our undergrounds now at risk of literally impeding on another tunnel,btohqsg
unfortunately very unlikely to happen for a place like Singapore  there are many factors in play for this when considering this  most of our MRT lines are built either underground or overground  with the only sections that are overground are during transitions from viaduct to tunnel (and vice versa) and the strech along khatib-yio chu kang and bukit gombak-choa chu kang  reason being SG is very land scarce so using a lot of 'surface land to build more tracks for express trains is not that efficient and also very costly.secondly it depends on what trains they wld like to use for express svcs  from the planning stage itself Singapore has opted for a fixed platform length across all stations  even over ground  and especially so with the full height platform screen doors built for underground stations (to save on electricity bills etc.) so not only longer trains cannot run  even smaller trains can't. This severely limits the trains that cld run on the line (e.g. NSEWL only 6 car trains with each car having 8 passenger saloon doors  4 per side at 5.7m spacing)with the current infrastructure running express trains are not at all ideal as they would be stuck behind slower trains so,btohqsg
can one. we literally build our mrt tunnels and highway tunnels 1m apart lol,btohqsg
We should extend ETS from JB to SG instead of HSR,btohqsg
to make my trips to see my grandmother in kampar easier,btohqsg
That's my point lmao the nicoll highway thing was a mix also of building with a highway bridge + shit soil and dumb shits la,btohqsg
probably wont happen again  letâ€™s hope it dont happen again ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
also if you want an express svc that runs to the popular stops  buses are a more viable option than trains  (e.g. bus svc 858 faster than MRT from airport to KTB/ north area  i say KTB as it's slow as hell ard that area so it's better to take train from KTB>WDL,btohqsg
when was it again? rmb i saw like 2004 or smth,btohqsg
yeah. apparently 20 year anniversary happened like a few days ago,btohqsg
A body is still in there till this day,btohqsg
We dun dare open it lol the soil collapsed along with everything,btohqsg
The station was changed cuz of that.. they couldn't use the original site anymore.,btohqsg
yeah  they didnt dig out the body cause too risky,btohqsg
190 for city area to CCK,btohqsg
gimme a sec lemme read the wikipedia article lol,btohqsg
also back in the 80s SG was envisioned to only have buses as public transport,btohqsg
imagine the buses during early morn,btohqsg
if it's those yellow buses with the pull-down windows,btohqsg
The head will prob be popping out,btohqsg
Yes but i did not enrol in a syf year (my syf was in sec 2),btohqsg
uk I see dsa players q stress during combined/sectionals,btohqsg
If tony tan got his way yes,btohqsg
Do you think it would be possible to have express trains by having only double tracks at certain sections where they can overtake the non express trains?,btohqsg
I sort of guessed it would be very hard and costly to have double tracks every direction but I was thinking we could have a solution like this,btohqsg
Express trains that work this way might be possible if the waiting time between each train is quite large  so maybe it can be implemented during non peak hours,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why I love Ong Teng Cheong,btohqsg
Don't think that would be feasible especially because our current signaling system is already a mess,btohqsg
Heâ€™s also the best president we ever had,btohqsg
We could try a Korean Incheon to Seoul system with alternate trains,btohqsg
A shame that cancer stole his life so early. If he did not get it he wouldâ€™ve ran for a 2nd term and easily beat SR Nathan (the candidate backed by the cabinet in 1999) in a landslide,btohqsg
oh ya my cher mentioned before all mrt stations are built with at least some elevation,btohqsg
Most underground stations are done so tbh,btohqsg
No  he actually could have ran but decided not to because of his health,btohqsg
they could  by rescheduling a few trains deployed during the rush hour period to skip selected stations,btohqsg
Based on whatever Iâ€™ve read up and all his interviews  he wouldâ€™ve ran if both he and his wife didnâ€™t have any health woes,btohqsg
There was an outpouring of grief when his wife passed away and some were disappointed he was not accorded a state funeral,btohqsg
been awhile since i read abt sg history lol,btohqsg
NLB and National Archives would be your go to area.,btohqsg
In fact even though he privately told Goh Chok Tong he was inclined not to run for re election in 1998  he reportedly made the cabinet very nervous by not announcing his retirement very close until his term expired. They were damn scared he would show up on nomination day,btohqsg
He was the president that started charities and questioned the PAP's policies and govermental oversight regarding matter on financial reserves and assets,btohqsg
That  in short he came up with many charitable initiatives and did his job of ensuring the reserves were well protected,btohqsg
And he had many clashes with the govt then,btohqsg
in a setting like Singapore where even the off peak frequency is still q low (5min ish  and excluding tuas link bounds) very unlikely. the more frequent u run a train the more track you need dedicated express services. Especially during peak hours  jf there is only certain sections of tracks for express services (e.g. at stations) they will still be slowed down by trains that are not express services (or at least more likely) so the most viable way to make express trains work is during off peak hours  which well there is no point since not that many people will use it and is not at all an efficient use of tracks  land and ultimately taxpayer money,btohqsg
But even though he did not run for re election  he sort of managed to get revenge because in July 1999  shortly before his term ended  he called a press conference where he actively invited journalists to come. He then aired all his grievances with the government which resulted in the government having to rebut him in some kind of ugly confrontation. The govt was not informed of what he would be saying during the press conference so they were caught off guard,btohqsg
think i read that in air conditioned nation,btohqsg
tho dropped it cus got water damageðŸ’€,btohqsg
OTC also was independent minded and did what he thought was in the best interests of Singaporeans. In 1986 he also sanctioned a strike for shipyard workers as he wanted to quickly get the management to improve their working conditions  and he did this without telling the rest of the cabinet as they knew theyâ€™d stop him,btohqsg
This made the then minister of trade and industry (Tony Tan) very angry,btohqsg
I want to go to bed,btohqsg
