On 29 Sept 2023  I went onvisa.com.sgto enquired S$1 = how much Yen.The exchange rate calculator displayed S$1 = Yen 109.721188Immediately  I withdrawn Yen6000 wz TRUST card in JAPAN wz S$55.28 deducted from my savings account.This conversion rate came up to S$1 = Yen 108.53835  a difference of 1% less.TRUST CSO subsequently highlighted I should have enquired ‚ÄúYen to SGD‚Äù onvisa.com.sgsince withdrawing in Japan  instead of ‚ÄúSGD to Yen‚Äù.I cannot wrap my head around the order of the enquiry:‚ÄúYen to SGD‚Äù vs ‚ÄúSGD to Yen‚Äù.Does the TRUST CSO make sense??,btohqsg
yes. there is a difference.YEN to SGD means you are selling YEN and buying SGD.SGD to yean means the reverse.Trust / visa/  any entity will have different rates  because in one case they are buying yen from you and in another they are selling yen to you.the difference in the rate is their spread or margin or how-they-make-money,btohqsg
