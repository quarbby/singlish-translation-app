Hello everyone  I would like some advice on which credit card is best for earning miles when purchasing flight tickets for a family of five. I am expecting to spend around $5 000. Can anyone recommend a good miles credit card for this purpose?,btohqsg

okay just realised it does not mention citi payall  you probably have to ask the customer service,btohqsg

Wow Liquidpay cannot link to CC liao.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
only today? cos I was about to recommend to my colleague and the app asked me to update the app and it changed.,btohqsg
LiquidPay by Card is transitioned to XNAP app by Gpay/Apple pay,btohqsg
So it dedtct from gPay ?,btohqsg
Via apple pay still considered online?,btohqsg
most of you are talking about revolut  youtrip / amaze for overseas spend. is there anyone using Wise?,btohqsg
May I know what's a good card for insurance payment,btohqsg
YouTrip / Trust rates are often better than Wise,btohqsg
But grabcard cannot use to pay axs already,btohqsg
Amex TCB + GrabPay  Maybank Platinum or BOC Family,btohqsg
Aviva insurance think cannot use grabcard,btohqsg
Aviva is dead  now under Singlife. I heard Singlife can leh,btohqsg
that one idk. just heard got people managed to successfully do it,btohqsg
How abt UOB Amex + GPMC? Can get cashback this way?,btohqsg
Only 0.3% cashback. Amex TCB topup Grab get 1.5% cashback,btohqsg
So meaning we cannot pay via credit cards for those SGQR that accepts liquidpay anymore? How does the xnap app works? I thought gpay will mean it will deduct directly from the bank account  and not your CC,btohqsg
You can ofc topup with UOB Absolute and get the 0.3% cashback,btohqsg
Ic. Then do we still need to use liquidpay to scan those SGQR or xnap will work directly?,btohqsg
Does anyone happen to know what is this for? Is it the Cashback for UOB one?,btohqsg
can use liquid pay or xnap app to scan sgqr with liquid pay/xnap logo,btohqsg
For those that use card like evol might need to be careful. Go through liquidpay is online...but xnap/gpay is considered mobile contactless?,btohqsg
anyway  now that vis topup to revolut have 1.5% fee  what method do u guys use to topup revolut now?,btohqsg
Looks like UOB one $200 quarterly cashback? $200/3=$66.67,btohqsg
UOB is still processing my application. I applied on 19-Jan lol,btohqsg
They give Cashback monthly? I thought they only give it out after the quarter?,btohqsg
either FAST transfer from bank or Mastercard / debit Visa,btohqsg
Last November I got itThis is actually my first quarter I think  I received similar rebates last month too,btohqsg
thanks. can mastercard via apple pay?,btohqsg
I don't think Revolut accepts mobile wallets,btohqsg
Probably it's prorated for that one. Then it starts quarter cycle,btohqsg
seems liquid pay remove add card function,btohqsg
Hmm that‚Äôs kinda weird because my absolute Amex  the Cashback is termed as Cashback,btohqsg
Sorry I thought it's uob one cc,btohqsg
Yes I‚Äôm referring to UOB One and I have 2 CC from UOB,btohqsg
Then $66.67 is your prorated for one month since you didn't have cc for previous 2 months in that quarter,btohqsg
Evol via xnap gpay should still be considered online and not mobile contactless. Anyone else able to confirm?,btohqsg
Wise add feee lomg long long ago,btohqsg
So you can spend $2000 per month on your uob one?,btohqsg
I remember someone here said that he used gpay in shopee and it was considered mobile contactless.,btohqsg
yeah plus minus thereabout  cos i did some tracking before thats abt the norm  i have a supp for my wife tooanyway i think i should get more cashback because i also shop at giant and shopee,btohqsg
Amaze + CitiRewards will work better?,btohqsg
yes but up to $1k only,btohqsg
If purchase vouchers from shopback  what's mcc? Which card strategy is good for shopback?,btohqsg
Good day  may I know kris+ with DBS WWMS can get bonus points on singapore hotel dining? It belong online paying and hotel MMC?,btohqsg
Is using NTUC app for payment considered online payment? Is it qualified spend for WWMC? thanks in advance~,btohqsg
Kris+ with DBS WWMC works for 4MPDHotel Dining  Hotels not excluded,btohqsg
last I read it's considered as Dining 58xxbut best thing to do is to try it for yourselfDBS app - lock the cardMake payment and it gets declinedCheck MCC of declined transaction with DBS digibotIf MCC is what you want  unblock the card and do the transaction again,btohqsg
think Chris has done a YouTube video on this and Milelion has also written an article on this.,btohqsg
No need writeup on this. I paid last month  got 10x,btohqsg
Using CRMC on FairPrice app gets 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hard to spend $400 with less merchants,btohqsg
what reason you use to cancel your credit card ? Planing to cancel the extra one and reapply after 1 year to get freebie again,btohqsg
I say not much use. Ask@ChrisHMSGto verify,btohqsg
no more crmc+amaze for liquidpay? What's the alternative now?xnap?pls and tq üôè,btohqsg
But some credit card has no annual fee one   the staff will ask you to just keep it,btohqsg
The staff cannot force you to keep it if you insist on cancelling,btohqsg
Just say the card is shyt. That‚Äôs why cancel lol,btohqsg
thanks  xnap with gpay is considered online?,btohqsg
RHB bonus interest 3.5% savings promo till Feb 2023  after that money put where best? Any recommendations to get 5+% with liquidity?,btohqsg
Depends on your card and issuer. But in most cases yes,btohqsg
Ending Feb 2023 also right I just checked?,btohqsg
next month should have promo too  do check for it  normally their cycle is 4 months  i entered Feb-May cycle this month,btohqsg
Heard the bonus interest takes 3-4 months to come in,btohqsg
yes based on past records around 2-3 month  that is why I hope RHB HYSA continue promo so I can merry go round with that account haha,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know whether using Citi SMRT Credit Card to TopUp Youtrip Card consider online transaction?,btohqsg
For new to Cc can try reading the tnc most information are there.https://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/citi-smrt-rewards-program-tncs.pdf,btohqsg
Use XNAP through Apple Pay with uob Evo consider online transaction ?,btohqsg
hi everybody may i ask with the recent Grab pay / AXS nerf what is the best way to pay for personal income tax?i know there is the option of cardup pairing with different credit card earning miles / cash back but what are the best CC which make sense if income tax is quite substantial. happy to hear everybody thoughts ! üôè,btohqsg
Amaze + CRMC got 4mpd if top up shopee pay?,btohqsg
Is Disneyland ticket travel or retail for crmc? Thanks,btohqsg
2 qns re GxS1. If you have 5k in a Savings Pocket do you earn 3.48% on the 5k  if yes  where does it go?2. Can you have multiple Savings Pockets of 5k?Cheers,btohqsg
can have up to 5k in GxS account  regardless of main account or savings pocket  total is 5k.only way to have more than 5k in GxS is let the interest continue compounding (it will compound the excess of 5k as well)cannot top up funds to GxS account if alr exceed 5k or funds transferring in will exceed 5k,btohqsg
"before you cancel  make sure you cleared out all your points/milesand usually to qualify for sign-up bonus  you need to be ""New-to-Bank"" (NTB) which means not having any of the said bank cards for the past 12 months.it can also be very disruptive for overall credit card strategy  especially if you're chasing the miles game",btohqsg
Actually in Singapore  no video on couple strategy which might work.,btohqsg
thanks for reminder. Usually I will set a 1 year+ few months reminder after I cancelled the card  to remind me to reapply again haha,btohqsg
I did it to American Express and standard chartered  no issue,btohqsg
nice! tho I think there's some merit or value to having a long term cardholder relationship with some banks  especially AMEX.they seem to value that too,btohqsg
hmm YouTube videos on couple strategy seems to be a gap but I vaguely remember there are blog articles referencing it at least.cashback would be simple but for miles  it would mean splitting your miles pool which may or may not complicate matters for some,btohqsg
annual fee waivers access to higher tier credit cards and even when you can't waive annual fee  the rewards they give  etc.but it's a case of YMMV (your mileage may vary) and there are also a bunch of unknown factors,btohqsg
Does anyone know if CRMC get 4mpd from Klook? Whatcard says klook‚Äôs MCC is 5734 (making it eligible). But other sources says the MCC is 4722 (ineligible for CRMC 4mpd),btohqsg
I know DBS live fresh online transactions does not include topping up of grabpay but what about normal grab transactions directly from the card aswell as PayLater? Does it qualify?Also what about Netflix  spotify etc?,btohqsg
Those using citi rewards + amaze  do you guys soley use the amaze card for everything (include online) or only use amaze for offline and actual citi rewards for onlineThere shouldnt be a difference right?,btohqsg
1 different maybe is amaze posting is faster then direct from merchant  if you need last min to clock those min spending  then amaze it,btohqsg
nornal grab transactions should count. as for paylater  most cards seem to treat it like a topup,btohqsg
do i still need to pay to enter airport lounges even if I have loungekey from cimb world mastercard?,btohqsg
In new to using CC and saw that we are able to access airport lounge if we pay our flight tix using that CC. Is it true?1) is it free?2) if I were to pay for my spouse and child tix using my credit card  are they able to access it also?,btohqsg
356 or amex or any that have airport lounge access.,btohqsg
If cards gives lounge access  its usually free for certain amount of entry. After which is payable.,btohqsg
1) dont remember which cards gives lounge access when paying for tickets. Only know of card giving certain amount of free lounge access everyyear. Example  Dbs altitude gives 2 free lounge access per year2) child can enter also but will also minus givrn quota. Not based on if used card to pay tickets,btohqsg
If you have total 3 pax  either you and your wife each holds on cc that comes with Priority pass  or you can get the DBS vantage card that gives I think 10 passes.,btohqsg
Wow. 10 passes per year? Nice.but have to charge the flight tix to the card?,btohqsg
Ok. Thank you for the explanation,btohqsg
No need. Free 10 entry per membership year from priority pass,btohqsg
Ok. Thank you for the advise guys,btohqsg
Good morning  may I know which miles earning master card is 2nd best to link Amaze  we know CRMS is the best.,btohqsg
UOB Lady's Card  but need to select 1 category,btohqsg
or OCBC Titanium  for online and offline shopping,btohqsg
I see. I went to read the tnc on cimb world mastercard for lounge access and it says I need to pay to enter so I wasn't sure cause the tnc was from 2021.,btohqsg
Lounge pass doesn't work like that1) The credit card gives you a complimentary invitation code to create a lounge pass account e.g. Priority Pass OR they provide you lounge vouchers e.g. AMEX KFA2) You use the account/vouchers to access the loungeYou don't use the credit card DIRECTLY or get granted access at lounge just because you hit a certain spend or what,btohqsg
Ya.. all my added cards have been removed üò¢,btohqsg
Xnap but this is like a nerf to CRMC cause it via Apple Pay / Google pay,btohqsg
Any alternate way to add back the cards ?,btohqsg
still can use amaze+crmc on googlepay. but yea does not work for applepay,btohqsg
Ah xnap is an app. Will take a look for that. Thanks üëç,btohqsg
Yeah suck for apple user ü•≤,btohqsg
It by liquid pay  so you can use xnap on liquid pay accepted merchant QR or xnap QR,btohqsg
Yeah I switch over to hsbc revo for using xnap,btohqsg
For hawker but everything else amaze still better overallI have more issues trying to get liquid pay working than amaze,btohqsg
Used LP for hawker food  via LP>amaze>CRMC...small way to accumulate miles which would otherwise go to naught..,btohqsg
can still use amaze+crmc on xnap on googlepay for android phone users. iphone users can use xnap with other cards like hsbc revolution or dbs wwmc,btohqsg

It was the ICBC Zodiac / Global Travel MC. which offered 12 and 6 lounge passes respectively. But their website doesn't seem to mention it anymore,btohqsg
Previously ICBC Now Maybank Horizon VS  AMEX HighFlyer  CIMB Visa Infinite,btohqsg
Cannot use CRMC directly via Xnap QR to earn 10x reward points?,btohqsg
No because CRMC only awards 0.4 mpd for mobile wallet payments,btohqsg
If I use liquid and pay by amaze from Citibank rewards card  do I get any points?,btohqsg
LiquidPay update app  unable to select payment via credit cards.,btohqsg
Thanks will go read their tNc ü§£,btohqsg
how do i link card to xnap? it only shows ‚Äúdefault‚Äù as apple pay on the app,btohqsg
ah so it will just show the apple pay interface and choose card to pay?,btohqsg
I can't believe how slow is uobApplied 19-Jan  still processing,btohqsg
yeah like all those other app that use Apple Pay like macdonald app  kris+ etc,btohqsg
I am existing cardholder. Applied for another card yesterday night and got approved this morning. High chance you got rejected. Can write or call in to ask them,btohqsg
Many times. Also I can check using website  says Processing. They say they have overwhelming number of applications and thus the delay. It's my first application with them,btohqsg
Mine from 6 Jan until now,btohqsg
They just replied last Friday for me to submit the Affirmation of Declaration form. Then it's another waiting again...,btohqsg
Just to highlight for CIMB Deal  this deal is exclusive to Content Creators only and not available on Singsaver website. So you have to use my links here,btohqsg

Hi everyone  I am collecting my keys for my HDB BTO soon and would like to know what would you do if you are in my shoes.I have about 45k in my SA and 100k in my OA (rough figures)Would you..A) transfer the 100k to SA before HDB wipes it clean so that the SA becomes 145k and you are able to hit FRS sooner with VCMA and RSTU or..B) pay HDB with the 100k and take lesser loan from HDB and then do VCMA and RSTU till you hit FRS.I am thinking option A makes more sense but I'm afraid I am wrong. Please help üôèüèº,btohqsg
how much cash in hand you have? If you have enough  I would suggest you can cash up rather then taking higher loan.,btohqsg
So would you do A or B assuming you have enough on hand like say.. $100k spare cash,btohqsg
how much loan you are getting from HDB? use cash is better to offset and take lower loan  if not you can take max loan (you can repay early though). If OA wipe away  and after you replay loan you want move house  you still need to pay OA interest.,btohqsg
So what would you do? A or B (transfer OA to SA before HDB wipe or dont do anything and pay off the HDB to loan lesser),btohqsg
I would choose A in your case - got spare cash,btohqsg
Hdb loan is worth it to take since it's cheap interest,btohqsg
Take as much as u can,btohqsg
Thanks for your answer! Appreciate it,btohqsg
See your priority. If you intend to shift house frequent  better not take too much loan,btohqsg
I think need to consider SA is good to top up for tax reduction,btohqsg
Okay so I assume you are also going for option A right? So build your SA instead and just take more loan at the 2.6% loan interest,btohqsg
Topping up SA has saved me much tax all these while.,btohqsg
Ya but doing option A you can still do RSTU and top up since have yet to hit FRS right?,btohqsg
But u hv years ahead as well,btohqsg
One year 8k very fast max de. By the time u paying 15% tax bracket it's a lot of tax saving,btohqsg
Because right now I only have 45k SA and im 32. So i only have another 23 years to go. Not sure if i top up 8k yearly plus my employer contribution monthly now i can hit FRS or not by 55 years old ü§î,btohqsg
Okay so you would not transfer the 100k from your OA to SA before key collection. Use the 100k in OA to pay off the HDB so no need take a big loan and then do topping up to your SA yearly. Am I right to say that?,btohqsg
I mean I am sure theres no right or wrong answer. Thats why I just want your opinions to help me given the scenario.,btohqsg
So now A vs B is 1 : 1 ü§£ Need more opinions Thanks@WarriorDan.KaijuKingz and@Derrick,btohqsg
Nope  I will use OA money to buy fixed deposit with higher returns  then loan max from HDB.,btohqsg
FD 3.8%  hdb loan around 2.6%  still can earn a bit. But really no right or wrong answer,btohqsg
Okay so that is somewhat like Option A because you are like shielding your OA right? So option A 2 option B 0,btohqsg
What is your monthly mortgage? I would Multiply by 12 and keep that in oa  the rest i will transfer,btohqsg
2.6% is god-tier in this current market,btohqsg
Yeah I saw your video on that üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèºOkay assuming I have enough spare cash to cover the 12months monthly mortgage.Should I do Option A and transfer the rest all to SA?,btohqsg
Yea but that gives u a shorter runway for income tax reduction,btohqsg
No right or wrong tho  u just have to figure out what makes sense for you,btohqsg
Even if u let HDB wipe out your CPF  what‚Äôs the worst  you accrue interest but it‚Äôs your money anyway,btohqsg
If you transfer out to SA you‚Äôre trading potential income tax reduction for higher interest rates,btohqsg
Because correct me if I am not wrong. Many people who does not care much or have not much knowledge on retirement and wanting to hit FRS will go for option B. So i am on now at this crossroad and hope you guys can enlighten me and share which path is the best for me,btohqsg
I mean I am leaning towards Option A but just hope more ppl agree with it ü§£,btohqsg
Because once i do the transfer its irreversible,btohqsg
At this moment can put OA into FD/T-bills to prevent HDB from wiping out your OA.,btohqsg
Yes  this is what I do. But i understand why a lot of people don't do that,btohqsg
Does ocbc offer new credit card sign up promotions?,btohqsg
My POV is if i transfer these 100k to my SA making it become 145k  and i continue to do RSTU plus continue working and get my employer contribution. The 145k will grow at 4% compound so I can hit FRS faster.But if i choose option B  my concern is my 45k would take longer to hit FRS even though yes I might be able to pay off my house faster and then focus on hitting FRS eventually.,btohqsg
Seems that you‚Äôre already leaning towards A and you‚Äôre just hoping for like-minded opinions for a confirmation biasAgain there‚Äôs no right or wrong and nobody will judge you for it,btohqsg
Yes. Thanks Joshua Chee Hean and Chris. Really very helpful this community ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg
Just go for it and congrats on your home!!,btohqsg
Just remember whatever you do  own your decision and accountability. Don't complain or blame any one if it doesn't work out in future,btohqsg
Because like Chris said this path not many people take. So somehow still will scared scared. But I guess thats where the understanding part plays a part. Don't just follow what people say. Understand it and then trust it.,btohqsg
Thankssssssss really really appreciate all you guys. Best finance community everrrrrrr! Thanks Chris for doing this! Keep it up üí™üèº,btohqsg
Work backwards. ie  say u are 30 now  decide on an age u definitely want to pay finish your loan  say 55. (If somewhere down the years you can pay off earlier if say u have windfall or what then its a bonus.) Decide on a comfortable monthly amount that u can deduct from your OA  say 1.7k. See if the loan tenure of 25 years allows for it. Any excess can transfer to SA. Sharing what I did. üëç,btohqsg
also be very clear and aligned with your partner on what assumptions you are making regarding income  expenses  etc.have some thought over what happens if things don't work out as ideally as both/either of you would liketransferring to SA is permanent means you and your spouse definitely need to be continuously employed and even if retrenchment hits able to land very quickly,btohqsg
I will take option B.  Don't uds the obsession with hitting FRS asap. You can only see some of the money at 55 (23 more years for you). Which might be subjective to change in age. I would use the cash to invest and at least it will be liquid. Though one argument would be whether you can beat SA 4-5% yearly. Over a time frame of 23 years  don't think it is that hard to beat 4-5% annualised.,btohqsg
most important point is make sure you and your spouse are aligned on the risk/rewardmost fin advice sounds amazing and wonderful because it fits the said person's context - it may not fit you as perfectly,btohqsg
add on to@warriordan888point that now you also have options to invest OA to get close to SA rates with the option to withdraw that investment (and tap on OA to service your monthly loan should you or your wife decide to take a sabbatical  etc. or what not),btohqsg
By pumping cpf  you will only reap the benefit at 55/60 which the age requirement may change anytime. I would do cpf top up to lower tax and not to hit frs asap . I would focus on building liquid portfolio where you can see and feel on a daily basis.,btohqsg
guys after feb ends where will u put ur RHB funds?,btohqsg
Yes  I recalled ocbc can apply for fixed D with cpf at rather attractive price,btohqsg
Understand your POV too KW. Yeah indeed its a long wait till I can see the money start coming out monthly. Thanks for contributing to the discussion! Thats what I need. To see all your opinions. üî•üî•üî•üî•,btohqsg
üëçüëçüëç ultimately no right or wrong. It really depends on your consideration factors etc. For me I just don't like the idea of money stuck and the timeframe to withdraw is subjected to change.,btohqsg
Guys.. is miles better or cashback?,btohqsg
Miles 100% if you play the mile game right,btohqsg
But miles games have to have multi card?,btohqsg
Bcos 4mpd mile card tend to have limit 1-2k monthly,btohqsg
To make it 2k a month   and HSBC revolution cover the crmc excluded item travel,btohqsg
Ya lor I get that point too KW. No right wrong just whichever suits you better. Like for me i don't mind stuck as long as its stable and then guaranteed when im of the age to start getting money till im dead. But ya i understand some people would prefer the $ to be more fluid and invest and grow at a even higher rate than cpf can give. But thats just not me.,btohqsg
And if 2k not enough  get dbs woman world mastercard (only online transaction). Another 2k more.,btohqsg
This 2 cards sufficient? But no fee lounge though..,btohqsg
U can sign a Citi premier miles,btohqsg
To idle and get the free lounge,btohqsg

I use those for oversea spending bcos crmc max out,btohqsg
Is it ok to use amaze with crmc and premier for overseas and free lounges then amaze with crmc and HSBC resolution for local spend?,btohqsg
really depends on your travel style  travel plansdo you earn miles to redeem for Economy Class? or do you aspire for Business/First Class  etc.Economy Class value isn‚Äôt quite there especially when there‚Äôs a lot of other options for Scoot  Jetstar  etc.Business  First Class would be great but you would need significantly more miles to do so.if you have CRMC + HSBC Revo and you max out both cards each month.that‚Äôs 8K miles per month  96K miles per yeardepending on where you wanna go  96K miles can only get you one way to Europe/US on Business  possibly return on Business to Asia‚Äîmiles can be easy to earn:(1) Figure out your monthly spending and match your spending to the right card that earns you 4MPD(2) Plan your big spending with a good sign-up bonus,btohqsg

A common topic that people always ask   cashback or miles ? And if should redeem or upgrade ?I have run some numbers based on Jan 2024 ticket to Paris and come to a conclusion that redeem straight up has better value than upgrading.Hopefully my calculation is accurate. Calculation based on Saver Redemption,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing  good video idea,btohqsg
If I waive DBS altitude annual fees  will I be missing out perks?,btohqsg
"Value of redeeming economy ticket to Paris (cash back equivalent ) = 2.45% (1.2mpd)   2.86% (1.4mpd)   8.17% (4mpd). In short  you are better off using cashback if you are collecting miles at 1.2mpd and take many years to accumulate. Any cashback in the 2% range + put the ""cashback saved"" in interest earning accounts will yield better result (depending on time taken to earn the miles)",btohqsg
What perks are you referring to? If is the bonus miles  yes,btohqsg
Any bonus miles after first year renewal?,btohqsg
Yeap they will claw back if they give you bonus miles for renewal and you choose to waive.,btohqsg

It depends how you use/redeem the miles. If you use it to pay your CC bills  it‚Äôs about 2.5%. And about 3% if you buy voucher in some of the app. If you want to know how much does your mile worth for travel. You need to find that air ticket price in cash and compare it with redeem with miles. Different country and seat are different. Need to do a little bit of maths to get it,btohqsg

I think a lot people been using amaze and CRMC because we can bring the card ovs to use and still earn points. Then we supplement it with HCBS revo.The only benefit of WWMC for most people is the higher spending limit.

since uob need to maintain 500 or 1k,btohqsg
ya if u only have 1 option  maybe revo would be a better choice,btohqsg
amex only 1.5 while hsbc higher %,btohqsg
Reason why I want to keep GIRO is in case did not manage to do manual payment  GIRO will still go through.  The most is don't get the Cashback instead of missing the payment. Double payment is fine since I believe it's either they refund or use to pay the following month then I manual adjust accordingly. What I don't hope to happen is that they ignore manual payment and continue to GIRO every month. üòä,btohqsg

Hi is there payment limit for paywave for ocbc 365 credit card?,btohqsg
The only trick I did when wanting to apply for CC is to see the required spending required and how many months they give to hit the min requirements. Then I just wait till the time I want to go holiday  I dump all the spending there from buying air tickets to booking of hotel. Then I get back the cash back. So far it works well for me.,btohqsg

Yup. GrabPay get nerfed  and EzLink deliberately doesn't accept Amex cards for topup (despite using Stripe as their payment processor - who charges the same fees for Visa  MC and Amex),btohqsg
So GPMC basically block attempts to use it to top up ALL wallets?,btohqsg

And do I earn all of the 2.1 mpd? Is there a cap for OCBC 90N like Citi Rewards?Basically  I want to know how I can maximize miles earning while reducing costs as much as possible. Thanks!,btohqsg
any idea when OCBC 360 pays the first interest rate?,btohqsg
I think you will only earn 1.3 mpd because Instarem amaze will convert the amount to sgd,btohqsg
did u do the questionnaire this round? u shld be able to do it online before u go to save time. im not sure bcos i applied online but thats my guess,btohqsg
ok  so i will only earn 1.2 mpd because 90N considers it a local spend (because Amaze converts it to local currency)?However  does the Amaze-90N pairing help me avoid the 3.25% bank charge?,btohqsg
This 1 eligible for UOB one and Citi rewards spending? üòÇ,btohqsg
Correct. Amaze converts to local transaction - so 1.3mpd (now increased from 1.2mpd)Amaze will help avoid the 3.25% fix charge  but the amaze exchange rate has been known to be slightly higher than other providers (youtrip  revolut),btohqsg

yeah may I know the maximum possible is at what level,btohqsg
I uninstalled liquid pay  don't think it has any use anymore  hopefully xnap works well for me when I get to trying it,btohqsg
Xnap able to use with what cards? Amex or cmrc ok?,btohqsg
Amex can as long as you can add to Google/Apple Pay (I believe UOB and DBS Amex cards can't be added). CRMC can also  but only 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
Ok I will try it out,btohqsg
So far had been working for me.  But may be it's my phone  find it slow in retrieving the cards for me to choose which card to use and completing the payment.  A bit stress when many people waiting behind me. Haha..üòÖ,btohqsg
Same here.  I am able to add Amex but not UOB Amex.,btohqsg
I used all 3 and now with DBS. Other banks support is hopeless,btohqsg
uob amex cannot add to any mobile wallet,btohqsg

What is the best combination for xnap?,btohqsg
If I am not wrong  as of now  XNAP  is just adding a layer to scan QR Code and rest of function done by Google Play / Apple Pay.  So wo the 2 is as good as not able to use XNAP.,btohqsg

Hey all  does this mean if I‚Äôm taxable by $8k  my relief will allow me to pay no tax?,btohqsg
That's right. But don't forget first $20k (iirc) is not taxed,btohqsg

What are you referring to by it,btohqsg
Don't think it works like that,btohqsg
hi  guys. i have amex tcb card and pay the hawker center with amex app qr code. may i ask if this is earning 3% rebate( im a new cardholder,btohqsg
U mean the source is misleading?,btohqsg
Sorry  read your wording wrongly. Yes  if your taxable income is 8k and u topup 8k to reduce it to 0 your income is not taxable,btohqsg
E.g. if I make $100k a year  isn‚Äôt $100k my taxable income?,btohqsg
There's a tax calculator spreadsheet that IRAS provides. You can actually use that to calculate your payable taxes after all the tax reliefs.,btohqsg
It saves you a lot of headache from guessing actually,btohqsg
Taxable income is total income minus reliefs and deductables. By contributing 8k to your SRS  it's equivalent of 8k of relief. It means that 8k is not subjected to tax at your highest tax bracket.,btohqsg
It does not mean you pay 8k less tax.,btohqsg
1.5 weeks for me. Applied this month,btohqsg
For simple illustration  If your taxable income is $100 000 at 10% tax rate  you need to pay $10 000 tax.If you contribute $12 000 to SRS  your taxable income become $88 000. Your tax will be $8 800 assuming your tax rate is still 10%.,btohqsg
Omg so much simpler now  thank you so much :)),btohqsg
Paying SP bill giro with Uob One card count as part of $500 minimum spent?,btohqsg
Yes. This is what I have been doing,btohqsg
Hey all  am interested in opening a OCBC 360 account  didn‚Äôt have any high interest savings account before.My salary comes in on the 28th of every month  would like to ask if the salary credited to the account can also fulfil the $500  assuming I haven‚Äôt withdrawn from the account  or do I need to put in a $500 maybe at the start of the month before the salary comes in?,btohqsg
its calculated by ADB. You need to increase ur ADB by $500 as compared to prev month,btohqsg
Is the increase in $500 only checked from the previous month balance? Am thinking if the first month there is 30K inside  then the next month I have to withdraw money out to 20K  would the ADB in the following month be 20.5K?Know that by doing this  the month where withdrawal is done should have lower interest  but am more interested in the month where the saving picks up again.,btohqsg
Anyone on vivifi here? Where do u charge your bills to? There is no online portal and bills seems to be recurring so I use uob One for now  but I was thinking of moving away from uob one and am wondering if there is a better card to charge to?,btohqsg
Correct  but you don't really need to withdraw money and just increase your ADB by $500. Salary credit counts towards itE.g. If your salary is credited on 28  and you have 30k in the bank  your ADB is (30k x 28 and 30k + salary for 2 or 3 days divided by 30 or 31So first day of next month your ADB will be 30k + salary which should be higher than $500,btohqsg
Between 2 statement dates to calculate ADB difference  does it include the older statement date‚Äôs interest amount that is earned?,btohqsg
Anyone has any idea how the monthly average balance is calculated for uob one account?,btohqsg
yes  basically any amount of balance in the account. so from the date interest is credited till end of the month,btohqsg
Ok got it  thanks so much!,btohqsg
Vivifi should have a website u sign in to add your cc,btohqsg
Yes  but which card to use best is the question,btohqsg
Muvo Telco I usually don't use real cc card I just use a virtual card like grab or revo,btohqsg
Revo works? I wasn't sure if considered as online coz the card is auto deducted every month,btohqsg
I think he's referring to Revolut  not HSBC Revolution card,btohqsg
Hey guysDoes anyone here using any sort of credit card management app? How do you make sure your not missing any payment ? Any suggestions ?Thanks,btohqsg
Does it mean that liquid pay is useless and can delete already?,btohqsg
Does HSBC/WWMC earn points from purchasing Amazon Gift Card fromAmazon.sg?,btohqsg
I make sure all my cc‚Äôs statement dates are roughly the same so the due dates are around the same time. For me all my ccs‚Äô due dates are around the first week of the month. So I have built the habit to pay all my ccs at last weekend of the month.,btohqsg
You can use shopback to buy amazon gift card vouchers to earn some % cashback in shopback. WWMC gives 4mpd for shopback since it is considered online purchase.,btohqsg
Thanks  I suppose HSBC Revo won't be eligible for points when purchase voucher from shopback?,btohqsg
It depends on what MCC shopback uses for Amazon vouchers but I'm not sure of the MCC. If it falls under HSBC Revo MCC whitelist then it's ok,btohqsg

I‚Äôm not Kelvin and I really like Kelvin‚Äôs YouTube videos as much as I love Chris‚Äô.However I always always have a bad habit of applying interbank GIRO all my credit cards except one. As soon as I have the card number  I just send the interbank GIRO form.

Is it through that we can only cash top up spouse‚Äôs MA for tax relief  only if her annual income is less than $4 per annum?,btohqsg

Good habit.I have a routine to check through all my credit transactions end of the month before paying,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not Kelvin.I use an app to track all my daily transactions and tally my credit transactions end of the month. Pay my bills before the due date.If you want hassle-free then maybe can try giro like what others have recommended  reduce spending or keep to only a few credit cards.,btohqsg

Guys just to check to link amaze + Citi rewardsIn singapore spending contextWhat‚Äôs the catch ?,btohqsg
Cos I check with amaze   there no points for local spend,btohqsg
makes your transaction considered as online  which is eligible for 10x points (4mpd),btohqsg
I have Ocbc titanium or citi rewards card. Would these work?,btohqsg
Catch is  amaze converts ur spending to online spend  which will qualify for 10x points  provided MCCs are eligible...,btohqsg
Just tried to waive Amex TCB annual fee and only got offered 50% off.. probably due to low usage. Should I just pay off my balance (excluding annual fee) and cancel it?,btohqsg

Shopback yes. All DBS/POSB cards exclude FavePay from earning rewards.,btohqsg
What does it mean by provided MCCs are eligible? Like for CRMC i thought online spend  will get 10x pts. Let‚Äôs say i go to restaurant and pay via Amaze card linked to my CRMC  will i get 10x pts since it‚Äôs now considered online spend? How abt Starhub bill or insurance? Will i get 10x if i use Amaze? Thanks,btohqsg
Any singsaver HSBC cc promo now ?,btohqsg
Do I get 10X rewards if pay with  HSBC Revolution CC at the hotel counter? Or it must be online or contactless (Apple Pay) only?,btohqsg
Contactless can be physical card paywave also,btohqsg
Just be careful when you paywave that the receptionist doesn't insert the chip in the machine,btohqsg
online is a separate indicator from MCC. Any transaction via Amaze+CRMC is online but MCC need to be not excluded also. E.g. Insurance mcc is excluded  so no 10x point even if it is considered online.,btohqsg
Anyway to use citi amaze for hawker QR code aka hawker stall? That‚Äôs the main bulk of my payment,btohqsg
XNAP + Google Pay  but heard some people say that XNAP MCC is an excluded MCC,btohqsg
No idea  some one need to try,btohqsg
I think Google pay for android only. I‚Äôm using iPhone and apply pay does not recognise amaze card currently. If use citi reward as Apple Pay will not give u 10x because it is not considered online without amaze?,btohqsg
Ah you never specified that you're using iPhone. No  CRMC alone won't earn 4 mpd,btohqsg
Aiya  then citi amaze will look useless to me now.,btohqsg

Hi community from my understanding of Amaze + CRMC  you can convert a transaction into an online one provided it's not a excluded MCC hence  I can use this combination for payment of Netflix  YouTube and Spotify? üôèOr can I just directly pay using CRMC since by logic these are online payment..,btohqsg
Hi gurus is it true that if use 3rd party like ShopBack/ atome that you will not receive the 4MPD (assuming eligible mcc) on CRMC because payment is split up?,btohqsg
unless you're scared that you kena DCC charge  then route through Amaze,btohqsg
These may be recurring payment instead of online payment. Think better to use Amaze+CRMC.,btohqsg

Hi gurus for paying prudential insurance  best to do citypayall or just direct ipay? With CRMC,btohqsg
Anyone knows when does UOB announce new promos about its credit cards?Want to apply for UOB credit card as a new to UOB member  but looks like I‚Äôm near the Promo ending date  and they can just exclude me from qualifying the $300 bonus by approving the card only in the next month.https://www.uob.com.sg/credit-cards/pdf/online-cards-campaign.pdf?i_cid=pfs:sg:owned:int:site:na:li:na:na:na-evergreen:direct:na&vid=none,btohqsg

Do u know whether this is true.Since reference month is in Jan  if account is open in Feb  wont be eligible for the promo?,btohqsg
I think you are supposed to open HSBC EGA account in Jan  put 2k inside. Then from Feb  you put e.g. 50k. The incremental balance from Jan (i.e. 48k) will be given 4.55%  till May 2023.If i understand the promo correctly,btohqsg
eligible. Jan balance $0 if account open in Feb.,btohqsg
no need open 1 month earlier before depositing balance. Assuming new promo start in Mar  can open in Feb (ending soon anyway) and register and deposit balance in Mar  but not sure if the bonus interest will be higher or lower.,btohqsg
If I use citi payall (citi rewards cc) to pay my electrical bill  eg 300  to earn points I will incure the 2% fee which is $6300 reward points = 120 milesDoes that mean I bought my miles at $2.55 (306/120) per mile?,btohqsg
I applied for this late Jan together with hsbc revo credit card. My application still not approved  called them and nobody seems to know anything. Never experienced such along waiting time before with any other bank. How long did it take for them to approve yours?,btohqsg
I applied the acct at branch .. immediately get acct no..cc I already have,btohqsg
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Seems like their online application got issue?,btohqsg
Wanted to apply online as I already have their online banking..but unable to..so went to the branch.i did asked the staff there .seem that acct can only open at branch..,btohqsg
EGA Approved immediately during CNY day 1 üòÖ revo card approved 3 days later,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure might have to check else HSBC revo is a safer bet Edited: a quick search on hardware zone  people saying yes you do earn 3mpd,btohqsg
Huh why like that one ü§î. Only bank that was that fast for me was dbs,btohqsg
I applied online and got instant approval. But cc application took about 2 weeks,btohqsg
I use singpass to apply  idk maybe a lot people apply during their EGA promo ? üòÖ there are a lot of people who applied before me still waiting for account opening and their cc still not approved.I was expecting to be slow too  due to CNY period and a lot of application for their promo,btohqsg
For those who recently spin webull lucky wheel  could you share the screenshots of what you have won? Curious to know,btohqsg
Yeah I used Singpass as well to apply  hopefully they will approve soon,btohqsg
No  you bought your mile at 5 cents per mile6/120You were already going to pay for the $300  the difference is that in order to earn those miles you‚Äôd be paying the extra $6You can then decide whether the valuation of 5 cents per mile is appropriate for your miles gameA good deal for me is 1.5 cents to 2 centsTo each his own,btohqsg
just to confirm u applied online right? maybe ur credit v good haha. I just applied on Sun and called in this morning. I wonder if it can be done before wed,btohqsg
What card are u using btw  the miles are v little considering,btohqsg
Shouldn‚Äôt it be 1200 miles? For ur calculation,btohqsg
Electrical bills do not earn points but they have this citi payall function where you can earn 1 reward point / dollar if you pay a 2% fee,btohqsg

Oh yea I forgot that Citi payall is only worth it during promotions,btohqsg
