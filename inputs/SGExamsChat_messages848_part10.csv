specimen paper is at SEAB. Can just download and keep first,btohqsg
So if Poly engineering student want grind Stats,btohqsg
interesting  no more mega practical planning,btohqsg
My 120 pages compilation final year for use liao ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
hello question for poly mates here is there any restrictions for phone usage in poly?,btohqsg
My cher gave me a look i tot was bad,btohqsg
But she looked at me cus i was gonna go on stage lmfao,btohqsg
I really cannot find the planning qn eh,btohqsg
Something feels weird for the h2 physics practical lmao,btohqsg
ya lor. It was free marks,btohqsg
"Why am i seeing ""capacitence"" in h2 phy prac lmao",btohqsg
Poly allow use phone in class,btohqsg
Why the h2 phy learning rc circuits now uh,btohqsg
No  but phone usage is usually at the discretion of faci/lecturers,btohqsg
capacitance is in the new syllabus,btohqsg
I was sitting down she gave me a glance,btohqsg
Nvm found the planning qn hahaha,btohqsg
I tot was bad look but it meant i was gonna go on stage,btohqsg
that's the 6 marks mini planning?,btohqsg
my eng  math was terrible 6âƒ£,btohqsg
Feel like i have seen something like this before,btohqsg
ya  current practicals have 1 mini and 1 mega planning,btohqsg
But hor i find it odd eh,btohqsg
the mega planning is practically free marks if follow my template.,btohqsg
Why they need use spreadsheet uh,btohqsg
H2 Phy is the first science sub to use it,btohqsg
I tot my hist wld get a1,btohqsg
Didnt expect e and a math since they r so competitive,btohqsg
Next iteration of physics syllabus  yall use python,btohqsg
Does Business courses in University requires knowledge of H2/H3 Math?,btohqsg
Actually I have seen them use an integral sign uh,btohqsg
At most h2 math stats side,btohqsg
If anyone wants h2 stats materials for preparation for poly/jc I think I have it uploaded somewhere,btohqsg
A pity since i had got A for the other 3 subjects,btohqsg
B3 el  everything a2 except humans c6,btohqsg
Rly sad his humans pull him down,btohqsg
is he good at humans previously (before o level)?,btohqsg
Oh damn h2 chemistry incrwased the organic chemistry portion,btohqsg
Now h2 chem need to learn about polymers...,btohqsg
my own O lvl years ago  only humanities C6,btohqsg
I quite wacked hist/ss tot i it wld be my A1,btohqsg
Ya humans rly u either got it or dh,btohqsg
I did not prepare for Geography,btohqsg
Shocking realised that h3 physics need to know special relativity also lmao,btohqsg
if now i would have did better for Geography because food resources was removed,btohqsg
Anyone here not on the r/sgexams subreddit?,btohqsg
That one is essentials of modern physics ?,btohqsg
Seab used to offer it as separate subject....oh I see,btohqsg
new moe h3 phy syllabus since 2017 that covers more topics,btohqsg
h3 moe phy drop the gravitational stuff and added special relativity,btohqsg
