"https://investmoolah.blogspot.com/2024/02/us-office-commercial-reits-prime-pulls.htmlOn the point on CAPEX  its interesting to note KORE puts in nearly twice the CAPEX expenses but still obtains the same ratio of ""NPI to property revenue"" or ""Revenue to Valuation"" as compared to PRIME.This clearly shows the main reason why KORE needs to pay so much for its CAPEX is because its properties are old and there is a need to spend more to maintain.This showed Keppel Capital had tried to fool public investors by IPO'ing older assets in a way to get rid of the looming cash needs then. Keppel seems to have pulled a fast one over Singapore investors.",btohqsg
