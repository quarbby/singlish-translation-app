U should go to a proper skin doctor first   for faster solution. For vitamins deficiency best to have blood test . Open wound one dont play. Later bacteria go in worse.,btohqsg
GP may not have the medicine.,btohqsg
Gp is not skin doctor. Go to a skin centre to see specialist. Gp one only cover common problems. Urs crack liao and bleed and gp meds not helping,btohqsg
Yup! Sometimes they refer to gov dr.. no point go GP..,btohqsg

For fungus  you can remove the whole nail out ‚Ä¶ super weak nails I remembered. Luckily it grow back. I was super worried that I got ugly thumb. I kept hiding it.,btohqsg
Dont forget skin is our largest organ. Specialist can scrap off the skin and test also.,btohqsg

Updates HS Optimus ($0.003/$0.004)(formerly KLW holdings)- On Friday  there was a sell down at $0.003 to $0.002/$0.003 but recovered really strongly. Looks to me  desperate seller who needs cash urgently  probably to pay up losses some where.Fundamentals- $11.2 mil cash on hand. At $0.003  their market cap. is just $16mil- NAV at $0.012  Gearing only at 4%- 52 weeks (Low) - $0.003  (High) - $0.009- Recent FY 2021  Profits were approx $2.1 mil. First FY that showed green as compared to previous 3 years of consecutive losses- SSH (owns at least 12.5%) Lee Han Peng last purchase was at $0.004- Brunei Prince Abdul Qawi currently holds 500 mill shares of HS Optimus which he bought in 2013 at $0.020 per share- HK CEO‚Äôs Gloria Wong Dad  Wong Ben Koon have been selling shares which caused the mainly selling pressure on this counter but he has roughly about 85- 150mil shares left now based on rough calculations.For me this one ‚òùÔ∏è will be an easy double bag in a year. $0.003 is an easy buy.
