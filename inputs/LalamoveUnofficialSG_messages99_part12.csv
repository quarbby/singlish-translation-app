Thank you. Good sharing information on Extra Virgin pizza and WaaCow.,btohqsg
Waacow got write in the job order no stacking n deliver straight  so they monitor I accept. If I stack their job I will make sure theirs is the first drop. For extra virgin pizza is oddle job with a timing given. I don't see anytg wrong if I deliver within the time frame. But they will still call n check. That's y I give their job a miss,btohqsg
But note that their job the oddle timing given is 45 mins,btohqsg
Most other oddle jobs is 1he,btohqsg
I have same thoughts too haha,btohqsg
I think LLM should impose premium on jobs that indicate no stacking,btohqsg
Sharing an experience with Dempsey cook house and bar. Waited at the restaurant for almost an hour. I tried to contact CS a couple of times after 10 min of waiting but no response for 30+ min. Meanwhile I keep checking with the service attendant there and ask them to inform the customer that the order will be late. My next scheduled job cancelled on me as I was late. Finally after waiting for more than 45min  the order is ready. To my horror  there are 20-30  paper bags that filled up the boot and the back seat of my car. I'm frustrated but okay never mind I decide to suck thumb and deliver. On my way to the customer place  the customer dropped me 10+ miss calls  and upon arrival I was greeted with an angry customer saying I spoiled her birthday party. She said that the restaurant told her I was late for an hour. Tried to clarify but no avail. All these waiting and opportunity cost for only $13 earnings. Please avoid Dempsey cook house and bar!!,btohqsg
