must appreciate our cars  most people here kp abt price to expensive can actually afford it,btohqsg
so what if people pay more lol  you can afford it can liao  let those that cannot afford voice to the mp or ministers,btohqsg
but i have full faith in my belief that cars will be increasingly unattainble no matter how many ppl complain,btohqsg
If yall got dream car but cannot buy  there is always#FULLLOANSQUADRON,btohqsg
funny how people worry about rich and poor gapâ€¦ cars are a luxury not a neccessity.Like if you cannot afford to purchase and maintain then dont buy car laðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…Its not like ppl live 50km from the nearest supermarket where ppl actually need carsðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
and to the people that say rich people hog cars  the government is very happy that they do just that :),btohqsg
government revenue from 1 new ferrari  i think 20 toyota vios also cannot cover,btohqsg

No ody complains about volvos la,btohqsg

thatâ€™s why ws business for w204 komp and rocco so good,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ scirocco is mainly gb issues no..? Sigh its a nice car but maintenance wise its just too much alr,btohqsg
Clarify that you're referring to arf here  later people bring up road tax argument again,btohqsg
It isn't bad if you find a unit that's well maintained and hasn't been abused and modded using taobao turbo etc.,btohqsg
Tat time I tried to ask abit a unit during the cars@Expo  kena diao by the salesman :),btohqsg
Yes. And on policies  we should keep in mind policies are most impactful when they are addressed towards the right segment which in this case ismajority of population.,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/N0alJHLOxz0a good watch. Not meant to diss any car one owns or going to buy (quite a number of them are not in SIN anyway) but key point to understand potential weak points in oneâ€™s car so that one can watch out for early signs or better yet carry out preventive maintenance to improve reliability. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
And a very good morning to all at SGCM. TGIF!!Serene!,btohqsg
Accidents do happen lah sir. Just that some more than others ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Just hopefully not a big repair bill to the hirer and thereâ€™s adequate insurance in place.,btohqsg
Juuuust only they release this car,btohqsg
Got insurance coverage doesnâ€™t matter expensive or cheap cars.,btohqsg
tht all the blue sg ppl cannot drive,btohqsg
this car how old only sia,btohqsg
3 months time cfm no blue sg on the road liao,btohqsg
Cheap. I thought $5000 at least for such rental cars,btohqsg
And the car insurance premium in general wonâ€™t be lower. Unless one take risks only to cover 3rd parties.,btohqsg
They should up the lessee premiums or deposit requirements (or both) if they look at their accident stats because it does present a corporate risk.  3rd party risks only would be diseastrous,btohqsg
Unless there is something else theyâ€™re after which is not per norm of leasing business.,btohqsg
Opportunity cost aplenty. Just how perceptive one is with any business.,btohqsg
The pininfarina bolero was a 4000+4000 excess,btohqsg
Not sure what it is for the opel,btohqsg
well if the bad drivers keep renting and keep  getting into accidents  it'll only justify this business model,btohqsg
4k own damage and 4k 3rd party,btohqsg
Especially with their history of over claiming and also claiming against drivers who didn't do anything and got damaged cars anyway,btohqsg
imagine in between you returning the car and the next person  someone hit and run on the car,btohqsg
Let's call it 4:0 and move on?,btohqsg
