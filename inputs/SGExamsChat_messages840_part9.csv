Forgive but don't forgetMe when my friend told me thay his friend called the police to shutdown his event in hongkong,btohqsg
Nah just something my friend told me,btohqsg
i finally found a walking entrance to this dumb mall (IMM) after reading through all this,btohqsg
IMM is such an ancient mall,btohqsg
the scenario you took reference to  is wild though,btohqsg
anw if anyone still has any unaddressed concerns please raise it up here while i'm still online,btohqsg
It's rhe first thing that popped in my mind,btohqsg
surprised it's still existing and quite popular,btohqsg
but like i feel not that active leh,btohqsg
i only go IMM if i'm looking for specific shops,btohqsg
not active when you look at IMM alone but if you look at other malls of similar infrastructure (bulk selling leftover products of luxury brands at cheaper prices than the original  how big the mall  where it's positioned like in the middle of 2 other malls around the area etc) it's not bad already,btohqsg
if i were to look at somewhere else like tampines area.. good luck,btohqsg
century square  tampines 1  tampines mall  our tampines hub,btohqsg
what the hell is the difference between all three  not even the residents can tell the differences,btohqsg
it's quite active as a town area but when you look at specific malls within tampines  you realize that they aren't even able to compete with malls that look like they're much less active than them,btohqsg
yep this is also one of the reasons,btohqsg
One Punggol also works somewhat similarly like OTH,btohqsg
Actually tbf tampines is a crazy area,btohqsg
Yeah it's judt a multifunctional space,btohqsg
But aren't they planning to develop jurong to parallel tampines,btohqsg
They recognise that jurong and tampines are in the middle of no where so they need to be properly developed,btohqsg
west side is trash connectivity wise,btohqsg
But woodlands can go kill itself,btohqsg
Wym the east has 3 potentially 4 lines serving thay area,btohqsg
JRL is borderline useless unless they want to make jurong and CCK/BB an island on its own,btohqsg
Wym JRL makes NTU easy to get to nos,btohqsg
well yes but it's still a shit journey to get to boon lay in the first place,btohqsg
But ur not wrong I feel that CRL will be the best addition to,btohqsg
yk what wld be the best addition to the west rn?,btohqsg
JRL extend to HPV  then complete the circle,btohqsg
