yea then they debutting as a new online operator this yr,btohqsg
Hello so we can chat about school matters here?,btohqsg
its anything basically that is not nsfw or political,btohqsg
When do you think election will happen this year?,btohqsg
Do you think there is any actual possibility of the opposition becoming the main party in parliament?,btohqsg
i mean in the future anything is possible but this yr pap still gonna win,btohqsg
my prediction is that wp keeps aljunied hougang and sengkang,btohqsg
but idk if they will win anywhere else and im nt optimistic,btohqsg
and i thought she carried wp in east coast,btohqsg
wp doesn't need her to carry,btohqsg
one day  just dunno when.Lky also predicted it will come one day I think.,btohqsg
wait then who r the pap ppl in east coast now still hsk ah,btohqsg
And that's the reason for the 2nd key by the elected president,btohqsg
that time the voters want to be PM ward I guess,btohqsg
Depends on TCB running a not,btohqsg
do u guys think there is gerrymandering,btohqsg
there will always be.LHL said before  no political party wants the other to win.,btohqsg
which makes sense  but easily taken out of context,btohqsg
SG opposition election talks can be quite interesting.,btohqsg
there's 1 main thing I think they need to resolve. And really not easy to do soFast rising housing prices.I don't know how you guys can afford it next time,btohqsg
I tried volunteer for them but no events lol,btohqsg
one 4-rm or 5-rm BTO can hitch up to nearly 1mil,btohqsg
if u add in resale flats.. wah,btohqsg
BTO not yet  but upwards of 500k to 700k already i think.Unless choose the ulu ulu areas  where u need to spend more time and $$ on transport,btohqsg
some BTO projects with very good prospects (ideal location  good facilities neighbour  decent view) easily already hit up more than 800k,btohqsg
sound good hor. I stupid cuz EC same timing as my time  Esparina  going for 800 psf.Now resale at 1300 psf,btohqsg
that time we could afford up to 800k max max max. so actually could have bought.,btohqsg
800k would be same as 4 rm flat,btohqsg
On ST Wondering how to fund your post-secondary education this new year?Here's a Q&A guide to help you navigate the various options available.,btohqsg
but 800k could sell at 1.3 to 1.5m  earn 700kjust buy any resale hdb still have a lot left,btohqsg
hdb cant be sold more than a condo tho..so if hdb prices gonna rise..then private property prices gonna rise as well..recently HDB enbloc 333 units for 700million to a private condo developer..2nd largest sale in en bloc history,btohqsg
future hdb en bloc will be more unlikely,btohqsg
right now they are doing tanglin halt,btohqsg
A 12-year-old boy who allegedly hit his classmateâ€™s head with a bottle is helping police with investigations.The victim suffered a cut on his head and was taken to hospital.,btohqsg
I never follow liaoChange strategy instead cuz need to stay with in laws to take care of them instead. Their place is big,btohqsg
so I rent out my flat,btohqsg
i thought enbloc estates are usually targeted to future land development  instead of buying a single flat?,btohqsg
but tanglin halt is sers not en bloc,btohqsg
i love the mandarin political debates most,btohqsg
in terms of yield %  hdb gives good yield,btohqsg
yea future land development but to private entities as well,btohqsg
we always have opposition candidates with poor command of the language speaking and becoming memes out of it,btohqsg
sers is a kind of enbloc  can la,btohqsg
I'm guessing most of us have even better command of our mother tongue than those opposition candidates lol,btohqsg
future land development is a general term which includes private entities,btohqsg
but they dare to take the stage and talk,btohqsg
"if not go on stage""we also have a plan""",btohqsg
Sure they dare to go up  just embarrass themselves only,btohqsg
Hahaha still rmb hsk's east coast plan,btohqsg
doesn't matter  it's still admirable in its own way,btohqsg
