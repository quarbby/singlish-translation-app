It‚Äôs ok never mind I will call the bank,btohqsg
no wonder bank phone always jammed because people like u,btohqsg
maybe take 1 sec to click on the link spoonfed to you..... its there. but the bank can spoonfeed in totality....,btohqsg
This is found under EXISTING customer I am a new one and the terms there don‚Äôt have this info,btohqsg
No wonder everyone say Singaporeans are quick to judge   if I never checked everything and is still clueless do u think I would come here and ask?,btohqsg
hi guys  i have a business trip coming up (~1.4k spend on hotel and flights). any recommended cc / sign-up rewards to maximise this upcoming spend? m open to cashback/miles and am NTB to all banks except for dbs and ocbc. TIA!!,btohqsg
I thought this is suppose to be a friendly group  what judgemental with zero tolerance here,btohqsg
"because you need to be holding the EGA account to take part in this promotion. you can't SMS to HSBC without holding an EGA account  hence they call it ""existing HSBC customers""",btohqsg
‚ÄúMust hold an eligible account and register within 1st to 29th Feb.‚Äù Coz this bonus interest is only valid for people with EGA not new to bank promo  of coz it‚Äôs for EXISTING,btohqsg
i beg to differ. these string of queries  unfortunately showed little to no homework done.... and none of which revealed you're new to HSBC either.,btohqsg
‚ÄúBonus interest is paid for Feb and March‚Äù,btohqsg
how to take part in the promo via SMS if you don't hold EGA account...oh well,btohqsg
Well‚Ä¶ confirm they never even see the website on how to apply  just see so good got 3.55,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt even find the 3.55 rate ‚Äúanywhere on the website‚Äù. But we are too ‚Äúquick to judge‚Äù,btohqsg
That‚Äôs like the first thing I saw on the website,btohqsg

Hi friends! Newbie here. I was looking around for High Interest Savings Account and had decided on the UOB One Account.Just wanted to double check on the Salary Crediting hack of making a FAST transferfrom personal account.I came across this.Not sure if this has been shared and/or discussed here. Sorry if repeated.,btohqsg
Dbs fast transfer and select salary payment,btohqsg
Like the name implies.. it's a hack üòÇ(But yeah in theory  shouldn't workifthat's the case),btohqsg
Took 3 days to process it,btohqsg
Can start to learn how to use search function.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/122307,btohqsg
hi guys  is there any preferred strategy in terms of which uob cc to sign up for first?,btohqsg
See which one gives you the best promotion benefit for signing up with your new-to-bank status,btohqsg
But if you‚Äôre considering UOB One account  then your initial choices of card are narrowed (down to which cards qualify for the UOB One $500 spend requirement),btohqsg
get cards with sign up promo that is not for first xx members only e.g. uob prvi or kf uob cc. Then get cards that meet uob one account card spend i.e. uob evol  one  lady plat  lady solitaire,btohqsg
we cant tolerate lazy ass clowns who doesnt bother to do their homework.. nth to do with country,btohqsg
spoon feed u ald still need help u wipe mouth,btohqsg
hi guys! just asking does anyone have the website/ excel spreadsheet to calculate when I can hit FRS based on my current OA and SA? thank you,btohqsg
Just take the difference between your current balance and the FRS then divide by your monthly contribution. Why need a spreadsheet,btohqsg
Anyone has experience claiming sports massage under physiotherapy insurance? Wondering if it's possible / what the process is like,btohqsg

I swear u guys are checking every minute. And your balance should look like this.,btohqsg
Mine is not in yet. Anyone same situation?,btohqsg
did u follow the TNC exactly?,btohqsg
I did exactly. Zero out the account on 29 Dec . Registered when the promo came in  then transfer back the $ .,btohqsg
transfered back as fresh funds from outside UOB?,btohqsg
then should be fine la.. give it 1-2 more days i guess,btohqsg
Thanks mate.. maybe the system is updating in batches‚Ä¶,btohqsg
wow u guys are so fast   still sitting on it   so busy at work . hope to watch the video by tonite,btohqsg
If zero out alc after registatation still counts,btohqsg
Only zero out before 30 Dec 1030pm counts.,btohqsg
How does the zero out thing work for UOB One account?,btohqsg
For those that zero out before 30 DecSo y‚Äôall still get the interest for that month?,btohqsg
yes... based on the month's ADB calculation,btohqsg
So we need around 110k? To compensate for the last day?,btohqsg
