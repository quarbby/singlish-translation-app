end of the day important thing is to just not rush. if you have a tendency to panic then establish a protocol for how to get out of your head,btohqsg
or a protocol for how you go about each question before answering,btohqsg
for me i straight up make sure to take at least 2 secs min to not say anything and just think,btohqsg

There was once my friend was sleeping during assembly  the year head came to our class row and ask if she was sick / feeling ok,btohqsg
Ok then explain to me  if a mother gives birth to a child after 1jan 2024  how much rebates she would have at the end of 10 yrs if her income was 2k a month,btohqsg
my friend was sleeping so hard she was shaking her head and eventually rested on another girl,btohqsg
