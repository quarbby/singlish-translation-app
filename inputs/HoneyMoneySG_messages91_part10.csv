Or if UOB lady's card pay thru Kris+ will I earn 6mpd & Kris+ merchant miles as well?,btohqsg
So must link amaze + CRMC than I will earn both side am I right?,btohqsg
Hi for SC Smart cc  $250 min spend is within 30 days? when does it start?,btohqsg
Any suggestion on this ? 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Because for long term earnings (4%) it should match with long term liquidity (SA or RA). You can’t expect any investment to give long term rates to short term funding. That’s upside down,btohqsg
not sure about krisflyer cc  currently im using citi rewards + amaze  it’s very easy to use as no need to think about mcc (not for travel tho),btohqsg
Idk if it’s sneaky or forceful. Under the current/old rules  if you haven’t reached FRS in RA and continued working after 55  wouldn’t the mandatory contribution go to SA and can’t be withdrawn as lump sum (as FRS/BRS not achieved).,btohqsg
btw side question just to check for insurance also can use amaze+CRMC?,btohqsg
never tried before  if can pay by amaze should be no prob; tho amaze now has extra 1% fee for some transaction  not sure if insurance is one of themmaybe someone more experienced could shed some light,btohqsg
How about health hub? is it consider a qualifying spend and will get 10x rewards?,btohqsg
The practical question is: other than shielding (which was meant to be 2-3 months long)  who would invest their SA and still get >4% rate? I will assume it’s super few.Shielding was performed because members want to form their FRS using more of OA over SA. That means they can attain FRS (otherwise why would they shield)? In that case when they sell SA investment  RA would have hit FRS  so the proceeds should flow to OA since RA is full.A lot of hypothetical questions but I think in reality very few will have this scenario…,btohqsg
In any case  many of us forgets that CPF is to help lower to lower-middle income earners. Not the richer folks…. That’s why there are caps in contributions.If we already have excess funds for retirements  then manage the funds ourselves instead of expecting the govt to foot the bill…?Many concerns flagged are those that can hit FRS but still wanna game the system for high risk-free interests,btohqsg
U can use but no reward and get charge 1 percent by amaze.,btohqsg
If you only have $10 to save each week  I would be more concerned about building up an emergency/buffer fund in cash or cash-like holdings  or aiming to save more  rather than jumping straight into equity investments.,btohqsg
Is there any high interest account at Citi ? Or any interesting account ?,btohqsg
Thank you for the info 🙏,btohqsg
Hi All  just wonder if this is still valid?,btohqsg
I think of it this way instead: the interest earned in CPF life is funding the lifetime payouts.The point of contention is if that earned interest will be bequeathed to your NOK  and that is a question of higher net wealth citizen. I think leave your NOK to deal with their financial situation  esp if they’re working adults.Break even age of CPF Life is around 80 years  I think that’s a rather attainable age?Without the pooled sums  not sure if there’s any private annuities that can give the same yield CPF Life does. The other way is lump sum and spread over our retirement life but what if it runs out… we reach both hands to govt for assistance?,btohqsg
Again  in the old scheme (lump sum)  idk many elders who would invest in instruments to give them interests at 65 years old. Meaning in that scheme  you would have little to no interest income to bequeath to NOK too.,btohqsg
Can i clarify that if im holding onto UOB debit card and savings account  will i be new to UOB credit card if i apply for one?,btohqsg

hi  a newbie question here  reagarding all the saving accounts say “first 100k”  what does it mean?say if i giro my salary 10k/mo to a saving acc  and transfer out 9k  will it take 10 mo for me to hit 100k or 100months? in other words  how long can i enjoy this “first 100k” benefit for?thanks in advance!,btohqsg
If you're asking what first 100k means  it would usually mean first 100kaverage daily balance.But whether the bonus interest (promo/interest) exists for how long  it depends on what the bank wants to do.,btohqsg
meaning as long as my average daily balance stays below 100k  i’d be qualify for the bonus interests? (if the bank never changes the policy),btohqsg
Maybe you can read the tnc and find out?,btohqsg
Can ibkr use to buy coins,btohqsg
uob one card  purchase of air tickets is not consider as an eligible transaction?,btohqsg
Uob one is not accumulate miles thou😂,btohqsg
i am not sure what to go for... miles or cashback......,btohqsg
How long does it usually take for the UOB Credit card to arrive? Waiting for around 7 working days  but both credit card and account approved on system,btohqsg
Now blame ppl for having more knowledge,btohqsg
Depends on individual. If heavy spender then miles.Cash back also good ah. Cuz cash is king 😂😂I did cash back for years and feel like not enough😅 now miles also another headache.Cashback is like money come in and out very fast.For miles can accumulate then when buy ticket very shiok can redeem without sudden drop in bank acc😆Really need to read the t&c of credit card. Plus they change their terms very frequently. So whether u want to make the effort,btohqsg
Lose-lose. If you have a hack and don’t share  you’re selfish. If share  loophole will get plugged 😂,btohqsg
i think i will just go for UOB one card. just hit $500 a month  get some cash back. and get extra interest in saving account,btohqsg
Yep I’m doing that also 😂 but mine is UOB lady card not UOB one. I use to hold that card then I cancel,btohqsg
Hi  Does Citi rewards + amaze earn anything for private hospital bills?,btohqsg
It ok   still can do investment separately just take it as RA is a another basket that’s all.,btohqsg
Which card are you using for categories outside of the ladys card categories you chose ?,btohqsg
Food & Groceries - HSBC revolutionShopping  restaurants  oversea spending- Citi rewardsmetro/takashimaya etc - ocbc titanium ( will cancel when hit minimum points for 10k krisflyer)Transport & prudential ( for the $500 minimum spending )- Uob ladyTravel and online purchase - Dbs wwmc ( this is additional if I hit my spending limit of 1k for the other cards )Disclaimer this suit me. Might not suit u. So see how u want. I might need to reduce my cards cuz my points are spread throughout.,btohqsg
I ofcuz have UOB PPV and VS. is also my additional card incase I overspend🤣🤣,btohqsg
Hi all  do I get 4mpd for payment via kris+ with DBS wmmc? I’m not doing voucher purchase  just the QR code payment,btohqsg
