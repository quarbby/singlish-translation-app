I have a FCH and fully stacked resume with plenty of projects  extracurricular and side gigs.My FCH landed me the interview for a job with a starting pay of S$18K. I got that job in the end. My peers with second uppers and below didn't even make it to the interview.Your grades determine your first job. Your first job determines your second job. Ad infinitum. There's no running away from it  son.,btohqsg
