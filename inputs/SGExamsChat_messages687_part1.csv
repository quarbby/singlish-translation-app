then u need to reconsider your entire decision process,btohqsg
mine depends. if someone catches me at a bad time iâ€™ll end up putting it off forever,btohqsg
i donâ€™t think itâ€™s smth they gotta fix lol,btohqsg
like its smth nus has but its not an issue with ntu per se,btohqsg
Tbvh you can only use your SU on your BDEs  and in my experience most BDEs they kinda give you a hint on what your final grade will be after your final test so its your discretion to use your SU,btohqsg
is the limited about of SU u have rly that much of a factor in a course of more than 100+ AUs,btohqsg
