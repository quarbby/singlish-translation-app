Hmm there are few types of questions.. is it you can’t convert and find the gradient and y-intercept from the starting equation?,btohqsg
Or you can’t plot the graph correctly,btohqsg
I think I'll just go through and try to learn,btohqsg
I’ll advise you to look at the questions you didn’t answer correctly  digest the corrections and compare the steps you wrote..,btohqsg
Ok thanks I'll try to look through,btohqsg
Sure no problem. From what I’ve observed  one common mistake is marking x and y values to plot the graph when it’s not y against x graph (which is usually the case),btohqsg
