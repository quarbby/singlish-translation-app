Updates on Moya Asia ($0.068/$0.069)- Initial Fake break out and Flushing on the results where it closed $0.073 before results day but was thrown down to flush recent retailers. It have hit bottom of the range of $0.066 before closing $0.068 this week. (Signalling reversal)Next week  high chance will go back to 7 series.The play should be very similar to Chasen- Both have FA to support its price movement upwards- Both flush on news / results- Both had accumulation and cleared the Higher prices before flushing to collect cheaper from contra retail playersAs we all saw Chasen broke out this week when many have given up. IMO  Moya Players are doing exactly the same.Moya results was pretty good actually as there were Growth in top and bottom line.DYODD. If market does not crash  Moya Asia should be easily trading over $0.1x by next year. Nevertheless  please DYODD and OTOT and one day/week at a time.,btohqsg
Chasen was one the recent counters we kept on posting on. But I guess many gave up prior to to break up especially at (2) when they were flushing  washing and collecting.Just sharing my view of stocks in general using Chasen as an example.For me  Chasen was all along looking to get to higher prices but with many retailers coming in recently  the players felt the need to flush (2) to make the boat lighter   as well as collect more chips at cheap.For (1)  they was a big accumulation by the players. But instead of going higher right away  they took the time to wash and flush out at (2) before eventually breaking back higher at (3).Those who won on Chasen are those who had the holding power and also trusted Chasen FA where they clinched new contracts and achieve stellar results. They ignore the noise and stuck to plan.I hope the above helps some in understanding a how the market/player works even if they plan to push up price.   they won’t let retailers win that easy.Hence  watch Moya closely.,btohqsg
No idea. I think 70/30.Depends on sentiments.Aim Moya Asia better. It is coming. Hope so.,btohqsg
