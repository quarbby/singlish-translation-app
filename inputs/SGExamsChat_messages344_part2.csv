I will always remember it now,btohqsg
ohh my scale I was told to do like12 boxes -> 100 degrees1 box-> 100/12,btohqsg
I just went through with my students only ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
how Abt a lvl physics  wats ur oppinion on its difficulty?,btohqsg
got so confused today I got like 7~~ then I jst round up to 10,btohqsg
I mean  the difficulty across the years,btohqsg
or out of subjects like physics  chem  math  do u think physics is the lowest jump from o to a lvls?,btohqsg
Database question was a step up in difficulty.,btohqsg
Apparently I heard h2 physics is now a shadow of it's former self from my psrents,btohqsg
in your time was there calc in it?,btohqsg
how Abt chem  has content gotten less?,btohqsg
I should flex a bit that I received the award for being among top 10 A level students back in 2001 for Physics ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I didn't take A lvl Chem,btohqsg
Wah they gave that award ah,btohqsg
few years ago yes  now not sure. They didn't update the website.I'm also quite peeved that my year 2001  names were not published there,btohqsg
only have cert and a medal,btohqsg
if in internal school exams since there is no bellcurve and all  is it still possible to get >65? coz practical alone is 20% alr ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
rank 39. Can still find the website. I found recently ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
only top 5 in SG went. I was rank around 8 or 9  can't remember.That year they chose top 5 to ipho and next 8 to apho,btohqsg
ahh I see  nvm  still top 10 is the strongest achievement,btohqsg
Quite sure ioi is like that also lol,btohqsg
I think now is top 8 go apho  top 5 of apho go ipho,btohqsg
not sure if ioi had 2 teams this year,btohqsg
Bedok why r u not as zai as them,btohqsg
It's ok yall a lot more zai than I was,btohqsg
I was doing quite bad ðŸ˜”ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
top 0.01% of singapore physics doing bad??,btohqsg
I forgot an important formula during the practical round,btohqsg
I sort of derived it based on experimental results but was still half wrong,btohqsg
@TanJunWeiis spho format also top 4 ban?,btohqsg
noi format is top 4 of each year ban  dunno Abt spho tho,btohqsg
then makes sense for top 5 ban,btohqsg
coached njc before in the past. Not easy,btohqsg
ya I am suffering in spho now,btohqsg
I was thinking hmm h2 didn't seem too fun  why not try spho?,btohqsg
it's an experience that will help u in your As,btohqsg
I took part just because I gave face to my teacher to go for selection,btohqsg
I was scoring Bs and Cs for A level Physics then,btohqsg
Spho has taught me 1 THING: Everything is differential equationsEverything is deltaEverything is limitsEverything is epsilon,btohqsg
Spho was a nightmare for me,btohqsg
lol hi took part last year,btohqsg
I didn't win anything for spho as I didn't really study for it,btohqsg
dats a lie  if not won't even go apho,btohqsg
but somehow got selected to represent sgmaybe because the better ones gave up and chose other sciences,btohqsg
honestly the qns are not that hard,btohqsg
I honestly don't rmb a whole a lot about my Spho other than not having a good time,btohqsg
but if u dk the formulas,btohqsg
but mostly due to my way of prepping,btohqsg
there were those who went for phy chem and bio olympiad all 3,btohqsg
but everything first principal not very fun ah,btohqsg
