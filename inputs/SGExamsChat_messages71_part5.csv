from a research perspective it's bad because you're subordinate to industrial applications rather than having the ability to develop wherever you want?,btohqsg
idk tbh I don't know enough so take this w a grain of salt,btohqsg
Yeah I guess. But then the powerhouses will always be more technologically advanced. Like Russia will always be good at missile technology than Singapore,btohqsg
Because they are the ones who invented it and keep many things secret,btohqsg
hey we have a lot of secret technology too!,btohqsg
Yeah but we dont have the space and missile capabilities of Russia  China and USA hahah,btohqsg
But I guess nobody wants sg to be able to fire a 10000 km range nuclear tipped  missile,btohqsg
Atb for alv PW results everyone :),btohqsg
I want Singapore to have nuclear weapons..,btohqsg
I didn't know it was coming out today,btohqsg
USA and Russian systems can shoot more than 300km in terms of airspace. If we procure them we will be able to shoot down Malaysian aircraft all over malaysia üòÇ,btohqsg
want to see how much shit mahathir is willing to stir when we have nuclear arms,btohqsg
but ok maybe not so good to antagonise the entire world,btohqsg
Some people suspect Israel has nuclear weapon lol,btohqsg
Maybe sg also has but keeps quiet,btohqsg
O but if we had we'd probably get fucked like mad,btohqsg
Its logical for Israel to maybeeeee have nukes I mean come on they are surrounded  by hostile  countries all wanting to destroy them üòê,btohqsg
Yea we have a very fragile economy dependent on global forces and engines,btohqsg
Ya but isn't the whole point of a nuke the nuclear deterrence factor,btohqsg
If you have but don't declare it's basically like,btohqsg
You think they win but u just launch a damn nuke at their capital,btohqsg
The deterrence comes when many countries are foreclosing into Israel,btohqsg
Damn I hope we have nukes,btohqsg
Dude I low-key wonder if China v US will force ASEAN to collaborate more,btohqsg
esp since now some of ASEAN's interests are directly against China's like in SCS,btohqsg
Imagine needing python to say hello to someone,btohqsg
I was typing gl for pw to someone,btohqsg
Then i wrote gl for python,btohqsg
HEY  anyone here in the media field,btohqsg
I would really love some advice on it,btohqsg
Or anyone who is interested in the film industry or other forms of media,btohqsg
good day to all  i punched my laptop screen and got a bsod notice  anyone has any idea where i can find help right now,btohqsg
idk if u srs or not,btohqsg
ok sorry for the boomer greeting,btohqsg
but yes im kinda screwed rn HAHA,btohqsg
u did not seriously punch it LOL,btohqsg
i got pissed because i couldnt login to my first lesson of the day and they logged me out of my sch email,btohqsg
so uhh like any other normal human being would do,btohqsg
i got sent to bios utility and the hard disk says 0gb,btohqsg
so im assuming i whacked the laptop  some drive came out of place,btohqsg
I would like a broken screen,btohqsg
oof ngl its all greek to mE,btohqsg
guys its official  you are immune and cannot get re-infected up to 2.5 years for most cases,btohqsg
reason why some people were allegedly ‚Äúre-infected‚Äù,btohqsg
time to start hugging one another ü§©,btohqsg
im really curious whats our gov‚Äôs strategy tho. if we don‚Äôt develop herd immunity how do we intend to eventually open up to the world again,btohqsg
theres no way this virus will completely die out and all it takes is one person to be infected,btohqsg
unless we are practicing isolationism ü•µ,btohqsg
Probably they are going to open up to a limited extent,btohqsg
yeah but as long as 1 infected person come through then isn‚Äôt that wave 2.0 already,btohqsg
