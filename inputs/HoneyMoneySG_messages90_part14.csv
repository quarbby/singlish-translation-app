Really? I recalled 5814 was excluded due to white list. I tried before and didn’t get the 5% rebate over the last couple of months. Was the tnc revised again recently? I am using other CCs for my f&b now,btohqsg
I hv been using Xnap with OCBC 365 for hawker food last mth.. and I got the cashback 5% this mth..,btohqsg
Hawker food probably. How about McDonalds  Genki etc,btohqsg
FavePay for Dining also get 5%,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI think they unnerfed last Nov 2023.. checked the t&c 👍🏻The original nerf was from Aug 2023  start at Sep 2023.,btohqsg
But ShopBack with OCBC 365 for Dining at Hawker doesn't earn me 5% cashback,btohqsg
Omg… thanks so much. I boycott 365 over the last few months coz I was too lazy to check the MCC prior to each meal,btohqsg
I think maybe because shopback already given 3% Cashback..,btohqsg
3% is for next visit if any  not current visit. So technically it’s not 3%…,btohqsg
This mth will monitor again for Shopback Dining,btohqsg
The way i read it is FoodPanda  Deliveroo and Grabfood with MCC5814  not a blanket 5814 whitelist. Anyway i dont use this card so others may verify,btohqsg
Yup I had the same understanding too…,btohqsg
Is Xnap safe? How does Xnap makes money  I wonder…,btohqsg
Haha doesn’t matter how they make money. Regulated by MAS so should be ok,btohqsg
Hi all  i am going to make a large spending on dining category  around $4.5k for group eating. Im not eligible for Lady solitaire. Will uob krisflyer be worth to get the 3mpd? I dont think i will use this card for other future purchases except for travel probably. Then i have to wait for 14 months to get the remaining 1.8miles to be credited. Is it worth to apply this card?,btohqsg
What other cards do you have?,btohqsg
CRMC for miles  UOB absolute  Citi cashback+ and cashbackBut im not sure whether splitting of payments will be allowed,btohqsg
Uob Visa signature is 2k 4 miles for contactless.,btohqsg
Then might to worth to get just one new card to cover that 4.5k. Make sure you link to Amaze when you pay for the meal and spend 800 on SIA for the bonus 1.8mpd.,btohqsg
can clock to new card sign up bonus,btohqsg
SIA spending need to link to amaze? So i should still apply for uob KF right?,btohqsg
Ya or you can see whether there are any attractive new to bank sign up bonus.,btohqsg
Have anyone here tried to pair Citi Prestige + Amaze to clock miles for overseas spending?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  in this video chris mention a hack/trick to immediately get back the shopback cashback from the merchant that you wont be returning to(lets say 25cent shopback amount). He say just scan a 10cent  but i dont see how the cash would be returned? Will it become a negative transaction of 10-25cent=-15cent credit back to credit card?,btohqsg
I have been wondering about this too😅,btohqsg
Hi guys  HSBC EGA must have minimum $2000 in the acc or no need? Will i be charge fall below fee?,btohqsg
You spend $0.10 to get $0.25 into your ShopBack cashback balance.,btohqsg
Yup  but was looking at the exclusion list for Citi prestige  it only states amaze*ezlink/axs/mrt  so should be able to clock miles still right?,btohqsg
No need. Will be charged if fall below with enough balance to be deducted on about 5th of month.,btohqsg
Anyone know if I can withdraw the $558 for the UOB Rising Dragon 🐉 promo?99.99% of me say can withdraw. Just want to confirm plus chop.,btohqsg
Thnks for replying  but sorry what u mean by that?,btohqsg
You can have $0 in the account  and the bank can’t charge you $5 for fall below.If you have $5 inside  they will take away from you next month on about 5th of month. 😁,btohqsg
It will be negative if u had 0 and was charged the fall below fee,btohqsg
It didn’t happened to me. They only charge me when I have money inside.If $0  their system will just not deduct that $5.,btohqsg
This is correct. But they may close the account anytime,btohqsg
Hi  just applied for ONE account for a few days and also register for the Rising Dragon promotion todayI dont have a confirmation for successful registration.I have some funds in the account. do I need to zero out.  and transfer back later?thanks,btohqsg
You should receive an acknowledgement email  but not confirmation email.,btohqsg
Yup. That happened to my ICBC bank account.Was lazy to go down their branch at PLS. So they told me just keep $0 inside account for 6 months and it will automatically close.But it actually took them 12months to do so.,btohqsg
thanks for replying . yes received acknowledgement  email.  is this final and can I transfer the funds already?,btohqsg
You can transfer in anytime this month. Your earmark date is in Mar.,btohqsg
Hello anyone here~> Green Card Amex,btohqsg
Hi. Wanna check  do you participate in new account opening promo as well?,btohqsg

How was the experience so far,btohqsg
I only use it to buy capita vouchers.,btohqsg
did HSBC rev VISA have any changes ???,btohqsg
Exclude 4722 and 7011. Mainly offline n online travel agent including pelago n Klook. Etc..,btohqsg
anybody know what’s the diff between the one bonus interest received and the interest credit received for UOB acc? the interest credit normally is not that much,btohqsg
Bonus interest is what it is in the name  the bonus interest. Interest credited is base interest of 0.05%.,btohqsg
When i spend the $0.10  to get $0.25 back as shopback balance  wont the shopback balance be tied to the stall again?,btohqsg
