Just a qn i have. When will the o lvl students get to choose their subj combi? Is it while choosing the jc or after getting selected in the jc the ppl choose their combi during the first week?,btohqsg
Its funny how i can understand my enciks but not your qn,btohqsg
i think you too used to saf alr,btohqsg
uh idk but u can choose what stream u go to for jae?,btohqsg
wt least for my sch can change,btohqsg
but like u need to minimally choose your stream ah,btohqsg
so like u have to choose your stream during JAE,btohqsg
then after u go to the school  you choose your combi,btohqsg
depending on your school and certain criteria  u might be able to change your stream in the JC before you actually confirm your combi,btohqsg
yeah but what if im dum-,btohqsg
at least you're not me :D,btohqsg
I think the qn is unnecessary. We all know ure dumb,btohqsg
MILO! Hows ur course coming along?,btohqsg
Oh okk. So like for eg if my l1r5 is 11 pts without chem in it. But my chem is C6 and ASRJC's min requirement to take H2 chem is c6. Can i still take that combi with chem or do i need to put chem in my l1r5?,btohqsg
Noice  das the way to go mah dude,btohqsg
i think can still take the combi bah.,btohqsg
but call the school during admission season to confirm,btohqsg
Most likely if they say C6 means C6,btohqsg
No need to complicate by involving L1R5,btohqsg
