Anua is iChange? That‚Äôs their physical outlet?,btohqsg
Anua is one of the physical money changers listed on iChange platform,btohqsg
Anyway best rate is 3.535 now,btohqsg
But if we want to physically change at the money changer for cash then have to use cash currency?,btohqsg
Yes  at lower rates compared to digital,btohqsg
Can use the physical and virtual card just like YouTrip?,btohqsg
Oh so iChange consolidate all the money exchanges who partner with them and help list the best exchange rates?,btohqsg
Anyway  i'll talk about in a video,btohqsg
New competitor in the scene eh? Some reviews on their app so far say the app is buggy. Probably overwhelming sign ups. Hopefully it‚Äôs stable in the future.,btohqsg
My friend say must be careful  they give future exchange rate  hold our sgd not convert to ringgit right away.Anyone tried converting and spend with card already?,btohqsg
The money changer has to accept your request (usually within 10 min during work hours)  so it's not immediate,btohqsg
Usually this kind of marketing gimmick won‚Äôt last long. Once they have enough users the exchange rate will be back to YouTrip kind of rates,btohqsg
Has anyone of u paid uob annual fee n not get the uni$? N nt have very good experience v the call centre?,btohqsg

Hi all  can advise whether the below miles strategy feasible? ü´£- UOB Lady's Card (Transport) for bus and train (6mpd)- UOB Preferred Platinum Visa Card for general contactless payment (4mpd)- Citi Reward + Amazed for online and overseas (4mpd)- OCBC Titanium Rewards Card for big ticket purchases (4mpd),btohqsg
May I know CIMB signature cash rebate by statement month  but promotion period till 31/Oct. Confused if I credit 600 and posted by 31/Oct  can get 10% rebate for define category?  Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
from 1 nov onward ocbc not suitable for big ticket purchase. citireward plus amaze can be use offline as well that is the function for amaze,btohqsg
UOB Lady for travel would be better.,btohqsg
try uob cashplus. 1.5% processing fee for 6 months.,btohqsg
Hi‚Ä¶ may I check the reason to split your purchase on the vouchers into 2 months? Is it something to do with the promo clause? Thanks‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Because monthly minimum spend is $600 to claim 10% cash back .,btohqsg
Please follow Chris method even better . (Top up NTUC gift card at Unity pharmacy is fine  another 10% $200),btohqsg
Thanks! I see that they have a 3 month option for 0%.My objective is to use the extra cash borrowed to earn higher tier UOB One interestAnyone know if i can use this?https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/borrow/personal-financing/cashplus.page?s_cid=grm:sg:paid:sea:go:na:tx:na:cp:041022-evergreen:brand:na&vid=MindshareSG&pid=CPPRSCO&ef_id=CjwKCAjw1t2pBhAFEiwA_-A-NKYFvQSPQ01ZNCzd0uijXrDfrDmy75NqDD0PzhGDx0wuLpUE5w4pLxoCqPQQAvD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!810!3!657522933971!e!!g!!uob%20cashplus!18773660781!148705352851&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw1t2pBhAFEiwA_-A-NKYFvQSPQ01ZNCzd0uijXrDfrDmy75NqDD0PzhGDx0wuLpUE5w4pLxoCqPQQAvD_BwE,btohqsg
Uob doesn‚Äôt give miles for annual fee but instead deducts your miles first. U can just call in and ask them waive off annual fees and get your miles back,btohqsg
Do u guys prefer using youtrip or revolut?,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best cc to use for online course fees in USD?,btohqsg
youtrip does not have weekend fees while revolut have,btohqsg
for kris+ app pair with cc. realized no one recommend miles card to pair kris+ app such as citi premiere miles  UOB prviwhy is it so tho?,btohqsg
because theres better options out there,btohqsg
for super big ticket items like getting fridge  washing machine then more worth to use premiere miles/uob prvi?,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the ideal card topping up youtrip?,btohqsg
No rebate for all card  so which ever card u have,btohqsg
Does this work with UOB fund transfer to OCBC under SAL code manually set?,btohqsg
Does citi premier miles get miles using apply pay?,btohqsg
but is it possible to do $600 NTUC gift card or any other voucher/gift card?,btohqsg
If you top up $600 on NTUC gift card only $200 got 10% cash back which is $20 .,btohqsg
