Nah in a secondary school carpark,btohqsg
Lol  many years back I used to work in textbook sales line. When I drove into the secondary schools to meet the teachers and HODs  I sometimes would wind down my windows and blast WMMT music.It was hilarious to see who were all the kids who would turn their heads  those fellas you know were the ones who played WMMT lol,btohqsg
One of my nitec classmate used to play wmmt  most of the time I went to nex virtualand that time  I saw him,btohqsg
I think quite a number of us probably got our start into the world of cars either via anime (Initial D 1st stage onwards etc) or games (Need For Speed  Initial D or WMMT in arcade etc) lol,btohqsg
mine was a mix of these anime mentioned and fast n furious,btohqsg
Fast and Furious I stopped watching after 7  it started looking ridiculous after Paul Walker died,btohqsg
their last movie is around 2026 or so,btohqsg
even without Paul walker it's still okay,btohqsg
compared to other movies nowadays it's pretty good,btohqsg
How did a movie series about fast cars become them launching into space lol,btohqsg
Too fast too curious drive up to space ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Lesson learnt from Paul Walker.Don't chiong a car with 9 year old tires,btohqsg
don't chiong a 9 year old,btohqsg
I just changed my tires even though they still got quite a bit of tread because i got them in 2021 (I don't drive that much these days since I don't drive to work now),btohqsg
Average lifespan of the rubber in tires is 3-5 years,btohqsg
