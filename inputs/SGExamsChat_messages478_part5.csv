Emergency  need help!!!I lost my PW result slip (white)  but i still have the yellow certificate  can i just submit the yellow cert in lieu  of the white slip  (nus admissions portal asks for result slip) ps: i know i can get a SOR and a digital copy from myskillsufture  but SOR will take too long  and the frigging msf website is down for maintenance until after the window closes,btohqsg
ok thank you!! can anyone else confirm this?,btohqsg
U should contact nus if ur rly worried haha,btohqsg
will a second opinion really change your approach or are you just asking for reassurance ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
approach is the same regardless: submit cert  if all good then great  otherwise by the time they ask me  ill have access to digital  and if that doesnt work get SOR    \,btohqsg
i also lost my o lvl slip + sec sch internal papers,btohqsg
cnfm gonna get shot during interviews for it,btohqsg
i submit all yellow slip leh,btohqsg
sor is statement of results (replacement result slip),btohqsg
for some reason all my friends didnt bother with the white slip and just submitted the yellow for everything,btohqsg
sor is a physical piece of paper like replaces ur result slip,btohqsg
