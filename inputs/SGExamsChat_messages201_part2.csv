I mean it would cause a lot of political problems for Thailand since the part they cut off might try to fight for independence,btohqsg
Great its NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN,btohqsg
And its gg to stay that way,btohqsg
If it happens within these few years,btohqsg
Unless we can find some other source to depend on,btohqsg
They used to have ✨ crossword puzzles ✨,btohqsg
This is 2002 o lvl paper,btohqsg
I have the one for a math,btohqsg
Singapore O levels or international O levels?,btohqsg
anyone got tips for h2 computing theory,btohqsg
H2 Literature Paper 2/3 kids  how's it going?,btohqsg
I'm studying paper 3 (Woolf  Woman) and my tutor just can't teach so we're on our own,btohqsg
;-;;; I take h1 lit so im done with my papers but atb yo the paper should be quite doable!!!,btohqsg
thanks!! Yea lit is okay  I'm more worried about my econs,btohqsg
ohh I see h2 or h1??,btohqsg
finished with h1 math and gp  lit paper 1 was ok,btohqsg
Instructions unclearEnded up destroying my laptop instead,btohqsg
I see....The old fight fire with fire tatic,btohqsg
Tfw not enough people take h2 cpu to give advice,btohqsg
kinds curious what does h2 cpu do,btohqsg
I just finished 1 year of it and i honestly have no clue myself,btohqsg
We learnt some python some html,btohqsg
Theory honestly half of it is intuitive,btohqsg
Thats why im kinda worried my sch paprrs and qns arent of a lvl standard cause i havent seen other schs papers,btohqsg
Ur teachers don't get yall prelim papers or smth??,btohqsg
Anyone good in python? Do plotting of graphs? And modeling curves?,btohqsg
no but you can try looking up libraries   i know matplotlib is a library that is used for plotting of graphs  histograms  etc..,btohqsg
Spent your 4 years in NUS computing well I see,btohqsg
i can actually print hello world in 15 different languages,btohqsg
I can write hello world on paper,btohqsg
Define good.Plotting graph  yesModeling curve q rusty.,btohqsg
Anyone can share h2 chem p3 possible topics,btohqsg
What wasn't tested for H2 Chem P2 and may be tested for P3:Chemical Bonding- strength of imf in affecting melting/boiling points  solubility... orbital overlaps and bond angles were not tested at allIdeal gas- eqns and kinetic theory of gases  gas laws  deviation from idealityKinetics - Although some part of it came out  rate eqn and using botlzman distribution graph to explain why rate changes when Temp changes or use of catalyst was not testedThermodynamics- Q specifically on entropy change did not come out and definitions for enthalpies too  energy level diagrams or energy cycles was not specifically tested so it may come out  eqn relating delta G H and S tooChemical and solubility eqm-Kc Kp and Ksp was not tested so likely to come out in P3. The use of LCP was not tested too.Acid-base eqm-Although Ka Kb and basicity of amines/amides came out  there was no q on buffers so may still want to revise on that partElectrochem- was quite extensively tested but can be asked on again in terms of LCP or calculation based on current for electrolysisOrganic chem:Isomerism was not tested at allDrawing of Reaction mechanisms were not tested at allInductive/resonance effects/steric hindrance were not tested too  Explaining relative acidities and basicities of other diff grps  organic synthesis on ur own  hybridisationStructural elucidation can come out with use of new rxn(similar to in 2019)Distinguishing testsFor nitrogen compounds  may not ask abt amino acids but possibly amines their relative basicityPeriodic table- barely touched upon with a few parts on Al. Thus might ask abt period 3  group 2 and 17 and their trends and propertiesAtomic structure: 3m on shielding effect and ENC was asked  drawing of orbitals and angles of deflection in an E field was not testedWith that said  some of the same concepts may be tested again esp for organic chem in terms of reagents and conditions for other types of reaction,btohqsg
I can import data from ASCII files in respective rows and columns only,btohqsg
What is everyone doing now.What to do if bored,btohqsg
U are done with ur exams?,btohqsg
Not interested. Give me free also dun wan,btohqsg
Curious cause idk what JC offers computing,btohqsg
vjc offering frm next year onwards,btohqsg
i dont intend to go there or to jc for that matter so i dont pay much attention to stuff,btohqsg
Does anyone know if we have to actually come to collect our O level results next year? The newspaper article said that we could do it online but my teacher said no,btohqsg
U shd be able to get it online but can choose to get in person too without ur parents though,btohqsg
Thank you  I guess I'll be collecting online then since I dont want to see my teacher expression when they see it,btohqsg
my teacher said that we hv to go down to sch to collect,btohqsg
"moe said ""to give students an opportunity to be with their classmates"" which pissed the hell outta me",btohqsg
If u dont want your 1 in the only world unique physical copy of your cert  by all means,btohqsg
my class fails the vibe check i swear,btohqsg
or maybe theyre j overaspiring but in an annoying nervewrecking way,btohqsg
Yes. I dont want L1R5>25 on my unique cert. Thank you for agreeing with me,btohqsg
