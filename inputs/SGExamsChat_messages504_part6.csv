Those that fail like 4 modules and those that get like 4.8gpa,btohqsg
ok simply put  poly is easy to just not study  you can survive  but you will never get a 4 if you donâ€™t fight your way through your classmates  form good relations with your tutors  and donâ€™t shake ur ass when u leave the shower,btohqsg
