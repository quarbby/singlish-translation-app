You can still open a UOB One account.,btohqsg
Anyone here w HSBC revolutions hows ur experience,btohqsg
Revo can cover most of your spendings that you mentionRevo points can be used for miles and Cashback. But it would be better if you have a HSBC EGAWhether it suits u a not  that 1 I think it‚Äôs best you decide for yourself,btohqsg
Hi all  which credit card is best for MCC 8699 (online FCY spend)? I don't mind cashback or miles,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website can propose a list of best credit cards to use based on merchant or mcc code. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Sure. I am thinking to have one account for new account opening promo. Cos rising dragon savings promotion seems like cannot run in conjunction with other promotions as per tnc,btohqsg
Does anybody knows HSBC revolution credit card when will credit points ?,btohqsg
Citibank reward card also as I‚Äôm waiting dam long for the points as need to buy plane ticket üòÖ,btohqsg
HSBC im short of 300 points while Citibank im short of like 2k+ points,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúHsbc when points‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Usually hsbc revo points should come in following month if im not wrongCrmc usually within a few days after transaction is clear,btohqsg
What does that got to do with the rising dragon savings promo? Lol,btohqsg
If I already have UOB one account with 100K currently being earmarked for Christmas promo  I can still register to open a new UOB Stash account for the Rising Dragon promo right?,btohqsg
Rising dragon savings promo tnc said The Promotion is not valid with any other privileges or promotions unless otherwise stated.,btohqsg
Should still be possible to run UOB Rising Dragon savings on UOB Uniplus account and UOB Account Opening on UOB One account. You might want to double check with CSO.As you can see  people are running 2 savings promo on different accounts fine.,btohqsg
I bought something using PayPal account with my amaze card. Like this consider will get credit card points ?,btohqsg
But how is the price trending?,btohqsg
What card  what merchant. Everything matters lol,btohqsg
They only had 3 options1. Paynow2. Atome3. PayPalWorried I chose PayPal and no points given. I use my amaze card link with Citi rewards card.I felt dumb cuz I had to pay more 1% transaction fee,btohqsg
Not dumb la  what other cards are better?,btohqsg
Cuz Atome also can. I thought BNPL can‚Äôt get points,btohqsg
I would think citi smrt card is not bad,btohqsg
But if have fcy then still amaze +crmc,btohqsg
Either way I feel like dying waiting for the points. Wait since dec to accumulate enough üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt dwell too much. I used uob lady card on some wellness treatment end up also the mcc didn‚Äôt match lol even though checked in hey max before hand. Just try and error.,btohqsg
And just to share kskin at different outlets they have different mcc.,btohqsg
Ya lo. The worse was the Ocbc one I go charge 1k in Apple Store when they alr change to no electronics,btohqsg
Now I just finding ways to get points for my Ocbc then claim that 10k immediately I will cancel the card,btohqsg

Hi hi  any advice if income tax should pay 12 month under installment or pay one time.  Appreciate any advise.,btohqsg
To me whether can pay one shot or instalment also no difference. Still same amount. My as well instalment,btohqsg
Pay via installment might be of a better use of money in a high interest environment today.,btohqsg
Yes installment is better for opportunity cost but also depends how much tax we are looking at I would say 5 figure upwards will definitely makes sense.,btohqsg
Payment at FairPrice in store using app+Apple Pay (hsbc revo) eligible for 4mpd?,btohqsg
If not then I probably missed out tons of miles üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Always pay income tax in interest free installments.,btohqsg
Thanks JT. Yes  5 figures expected,btohqsg
Alternative way to use credit card to pay for hawker food.,btohqsg

Too complicated to use cardup  citipayall and hsbc EGA etc‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
üëåhappy problem to hear üëÇit be real good for hsbc ega,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt think of any reason not to take the free lunch. Even if tax is 4 digits.,btohqsg
