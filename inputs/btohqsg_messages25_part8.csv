As long as Foreigner wife/husband works and contribute to Singapore. Even better have kids here and house,btohqsg
PR will be very high chance to get,btohqsg
If have sg child can apply bto,btohqsg
Yes SG child apply BTO with u is 2 SC component.But loan amount is Only on you not with your spouse ha.Grant is on u both means grant will he lower Because they see both income de for grant,btohqsg
I see . His wife planning to go back her country in next few years .,btohqsg
Hdb sometimes funny. Grant see both income. Loan only see one ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ya they scared ma u not PR here how to give u more loan not fair to others,btohqsg
Huh foreign spouse also can get grant meh ? I tot both loan and grants only see the Singaporean spouse income ?,btohqsg
Loan is see Singaporen/PR income Only,btohqsg
Grants is Not.Grants see both spouse income to give,btohqsg
So Grants will be lower because is 2 x income.Loan will be also lower because only sees one Singaporean applicant income,btohqsg
So follow which table ? Grant table for first timer households ?He was telling me he can only get singles grant which is $0 lol,btohqsg
For grant they see both income. For loan only 1 person income ðŸ˜…. So for example u together have income of 10k. Then not eligible for grant..but loan only see the sc income. So get lower loan,btohqsg
Your SC baby/kids will be an essisenal occupier means must fulfill MOP,btohqsg
Ok thanks for the clarification guys !,btohqsg
As long as the wife is working  her income would be included,btohqsg
Yes but first still must be eligible to apply BTO/SBF la. 1 SC + 1 Non SC/PR cannot apply BTO unless have SC childAlso 1 SC + 1PR also have 1 x levy of 10KAfter PR get SC or have a SC child this $10K will be return to u,btohqsg
Thanks for clarification. If he applies with his foreign spouse 2rm bto after 35  both their income considered for grants right ?,btohqsg
Both their income for grant yes.Loan only based on SC/PR applicant only,btohqsg
Wa 35 apply 2rm flexi. How long more ? If really married already apply PR get bigger house better,btohqsg
I got friend who is single and regret to get 2rm flexi  should have go apply for 3rm resale,btohqsg
Ya next time 2rm flexi MOP sell also flip,btohqsg
2room flexi bto is better than 3 room resale imho. At least after mop u can sell and get good profit then upgrade to bigger flat. The resale value of a 2room bto is very high,btohqsg
My friends got into a dilemma situation:They got a balloted queue number within flat supply for the june bto; then previous balloted number which exceeded the flat supply invited them to flat selection.Will there be penalty if they reject the invitation? They prefer the latest balloted number within flat supply..Anyone had similar experiences before?,btohqsg
Need to be save by the ethnic quota or less than 10 unit in this case. If not got non selection penalty,btohqsg
Is there ways to check how many units left for certain bto supply?,btohqsg
Yea u r right . Those old 3 rm flats in amk selling for like 400k+,btohqsg
Really ? I tot 2 rm flexi not popular,btohqsg
Heâ€™s got 2 more yrs . I told him if wanna bto   can only do so for 2 rm and need to wait for successful ballot . Why not just get resale straightaway?,btohqsg
"Hello! As i can't find this info anywhere  may I know if the person applying for hfe (while adding applicant 2) affects the order of being co-owners? For example  i would use my singpass to apply for hfe and add another as co-owner  is there any ""rank"" such as will myself be ""main"" or will it be the same for all? And the point of contact will be the applicant 1 (aka myself) or will it be both?",btohqsg
Sorry would like to check if there's any grp for BTO project under the Yishun project (NOV 2022) ?,btohqsg

Yes one will be the main applicant which all correspondence will be sent through.,btohqsg
Ah  i see! Thanks for your reply! How about when it comes to the loan? Will the main applicant be the one to shoulder the most?,btohqsg
For loan you can specify the proportion of loan amount being paid back via HDB portal next time.,btohqsg
Ohhh  i see! Thank you so much!,btohqsg
Has the additional subsidies information been released yet for the prime and plus flats? Like the amount etc. I assume this is on top of the EHG?,btohqsg
If PR then will consider right?My wife is PR and our HFE issued to both our names,btohqsg
Yes PR is considered for the loan. But overall have a $10K levy if no SC child,btohqsg
If have SC child already this $10k will be return,btohqsg
For Plus/Prime  it will be included in the unit pricing already. They donâ€™t usually tell you how much subsidies theyâ€™ll give on the unit pricing but they will tell you how much they are going to clawback if you sell,btohqsg
Anyone got link to queensway canopy resident chat?,btohqsg
Thought only senior (above 55ys?) can apply  2room flexi?,btohqsg
Ah i see. Cos i know that 2room Flexi term longest lease for senior is up to 45yrs. If an applicant is at 49yrs cannot apply cos 49+45=94   must add up the age to 95yrs then can apply.,btohqsg
Was it due to high amount of drop out? And it pushes you to within the supply?,btohqsg
Do u mind sharing which year of the project was this?,btohqsg
Hows the number of units left when reach your turn?,btohqsg
Oh but u were saved by the ethnic quota.. dont mind i guess is it non-chinese quota?,btohqsg
Hi Guys i need some advice. I just got my HFE approved last week. My partner and i was granted $80k EHG grant for resale flats. But today the news came out as EHG grants up to $120k. Is it possible for me to cancel this HFE letter and re-apply for another HFE in hopes to get the $120k ehg grant?,btohqsg
For those who have an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter but have yet to apply for a flat in a sales exercise  HDB will update their HFE letter via the HDB Flat Portal to reflect the revised EHG amount and will notify them individually by email[3]. Applicants do not need to re-submit their HFE applications.Source:https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/measures-to-cool-the-hdb-resale-market-and-provide-more-support-for-first-time-home-buyers#:~:text=The%20EHG%20will%20be%20increased amount%20of%20%2440%2C000%20to%20%2460%2C000.,btohqsg
