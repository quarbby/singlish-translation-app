so if itâ€™s conferred late then your convo is pushed back,btohqsg
if you intern in the last sem it can cause the delay,btohqsg
itâ€™s not a thing thatâ€™ll fuck you yo,btohqsg
3 mnths away from graduation tho,btohqsg
i mean in the long run its not really that big of a deal but,btohqsg
yknow you want to graduate with the friends you actually know,btohqsg
they literally warn you that if you intern in your last sem  the admin stuff might not be settled before convocation,btohqsg
thereâ€™s a ton of admin and logistics to settle,btohqsg
all you see is name on cert + ceremony,btohqsg
Well thankfully i did intern in y2,btohqsg
Now i just need to do the fyp,btohqsg
like for example if i defend my dissertation in july,btohqsg
technically is there any way to hasten up their process so i can attend convo in time,btohqsg
i might not have convocation with yall,btohqsg
realistically you can try to get them to push but thereâ€™s a limit,btohqsg
i might delay my convocation tho if i intern,btohqsg
Do you have a y4s1 mod you are interested in?,btohqsg
tbf itâ€™s objectively the safer choice,btohqsg
atp he just wants to grad,btohqsg
You cannot do mods with internship,btohqsg
That is just the shittiest thing,btohqsg
itâ€™s a it sucks but i gets situation,btohqsg
that one is really not a concern to me,btohqsg
That's like 17% off on shopee,btohqsg

I rmb the ndp musical directior hardcore fan of applr...,btohqsg
Eventually you have to clear the grad requirementd,btohqsg
With the price I rather get an airtag,btohqsg

"i dont need to ""study"" anymore",btohqsg

i think i gotta shift my intern to y4s1,btohqsg
i mean in the grand scheme of things it really doesnt change anything much,btohqsg
just that i did have a y4s1 mod i wanted to do,btohqsg
I wonder if anyone did intern while secretly doing a y4s1 mod,btohqsg
I have seen cases of ppl bringing forward hw0218 or ps0001 or ps0002 but never rlly much of this case,btohqsg
They literally have it in massive letters when u open up the document,btohqsg
How isit their fault if ppl don't read the terms and conditions,btohqsg
idt stars would allow you to?,btohqsg
and even if they did  once office finds out they might just remove,btohqsg
The reason is cuz CAO is a separate department,btohqsg
