dont compare too much cuz itll make you fear to even try (i say that cuz i do that LOL) its a good estimate of what youre lacking but theres alot that can help u outu can always try out leetcode for practice (friend told me to start and it helps) and w3school for references to the language,btohqsg
i use w3school heh . Im just worried i cant get in cuz its not a very popular job but its a competitive workfield 😓,btohqsg
i just wna prepare myself and do everyt i can to try and atleast get shortlisted,btohqsg
they got diff languages so u shud be ok one,btohqsg
okok thank you stay 🙂‍↕️ uve been of much help 🩷,btohqsg

I not sure if this is the right place to warn ppl of scam but I am going to warn anyways. Please treat any unknown local phone number (without +65) with skepticism. I was proposing to my friend of a way that scammers overseas can call without +65 prefix.,btohqsg
The method seem logical and possible in practice and theoretically.,btohqsg
I sent a message to my IT mentor and he will take some time to evaluate this method before we can create countermeasures,btohqsg
How about just not pick up any call unless its your parents,btohqsg
Any one else that wants to reach you just text,btohqsg
Hmm ... for business a bit hard. Personal phone easy to not pick up unknown calls haha,btohqsg
They can hack just by picking up phone?,btohqsg
Why is my english not englishing,btohqsg
But this method will work with android   it is unlikely in iPhone case,btohqsg
Take care of yourself and don't get too tired,btohqsg
A levels can cause deterioration of brain function lol 😅😅😅 my math teacher remarked on this particular moment he did a question for his f maths,btohqsg
It was later revealed the question itself was flawed,btohqsg
He spent 5 hours trying to find a solution and unable to sleep and later realised the question was unsolvable 😅😅😭😭😭,btohqsg
Dun worry it was not exam paper,btohqsg
It was some practice drill he did before h1/h2/h3 system was implemented,btohqsg
A levels woke me up 1st time. I was just not studying during O levels time.,btohqsg
So had to compensate by working extra hard at a levels ?,btohqsg
no  i was only good at maths at O level. So I went to take F Maths at A lvl,btohqsg
F Maths wasn't tough for me that time,btohqsg
in the above pdf it shows ntu has only 17 ai and society students,btohqsg
so does that mean ai and society course is very competievite or none applied to the course,btohqsg

Well only way to find out is post in reddit r/sgexams I guess. I dw to give misleading information for this matter.,btohqsg
That is if I dk or unable to answer ， I dw to end up putting people in an awkward position later on as a result of giving misleading stats,btohqsg
explains why I didn't manage to get in that batch lol,btohqsg
Engineering is very important to society,btohqsg
They are the basis of urbanisation 👍,btohqsg
but pretty sure those in EEE normally diverge out or join back doing CS / Programming majors,btohqsg
not really many do actual Electrical works nowadays,btohqsg
those who do either really like 3 phases or really like project management lol,btohqsg
Actually I was thinking if engineering jobs can be AI automated in future,btohqsg
Thing is job seeking ppl have to seek jobs that is not replicable by AI,btohqsg
yes he not interested in working in that industry,btohqsg
hi is NTU CCEB heavy on chem?,btohqsg
im thinking between NTU CCEB  NUS Biomed eng  NUS chem eng,btohqsg
but my chem is super bad  and I take PCMe,btohqsg
but im really intereted in chem...do I follow my grade or my heart?,btohqsg
i study really hard for chem but it doesn't click,btohqsg
i saw the syllabus document  it has a lot of bio stuff  i saw RNA in one of the notes...,btohqsg
Are you refering to their chem  chem eng or their bioeng major?,btohqsg
I think you shld find something that fills both grade* and heart. But if you had choose one  I'd recommend following heart first,btohqsg
chem eng or bioeng... i cant decide,btohqsg
i wanna do like chemical plant  yet help with healthcare tehcnology,btohqsg
when do we have to choose the major for CCEB ah?,btohqsg
