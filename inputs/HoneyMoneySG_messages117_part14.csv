For those of you who had participated in UOB Big Savings Payout Promotion in May  did you receive any email from UOB on your eligibility?,btohqsg
"I had an email ""Thank you for your participation"" from uob",btohqsg
@antonio191203may I know when did you receive? Has your fund been earmarked in the internet banking portal?,btohqsg
Actually im april batch. Just realized u are talking about may.,btohqsg
With 100k  should I put it in OCBC 360  clock salary bonus  incremental bonus and spending bonus of 4.60% or put them in SSB ~3% for 10 years?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 is better. Higher interest and better liquidity.,btohqsg
"Only hassle is you must make sure the incremental $500 saving into your OCBC account every month. It is best not to have any ad-hoc withdrawal in case you affect the MAB. Once a while  you need to ""reset"" it",btohqsg
received mine at around 15 June,btohqsg
Ic... Has your fund been earmarked?,btohqsg
For UOB rising dragon promoAfter I signup  can I move out fund from one account then move back in 2 days later?,btohqsg
it gets even worse with the latest plunging chicken promo due to the fact they have an EXPLICIT clause.. funds withdrawn and redeposit within last 30 days,btohqsg
Did you read the definition of fresh funds?,btohqsg
But I accidentally transfer in this morning before signing upSo it‚Äôs kinda less then 12 hrsSince the terms and condition say MAB from March 2024‚Ä¶I have transferred out Liao,btohqsg
to give you some comfort.. SOMETIMES.. banks can say something in black and white.. but they don't enforce or UNABLE to enforce due to system constraints.see whether you want to take the risk or not. And if you don't get earmark  are you ok with just 4% p.a. interest on your $150k (fail to get the cash bonus),btohqsg
You transferred out on Feb 29?,btohqsg
Nope. I just want to top up fresh new 20k on top of my existing cash in one account,btohqsg
These 20k part of any of your UOB accounts from 1 Mar onwards?,btohqsg
Nope. It‚Äôs in DBS account. Butttt ‚Ä¶ I made the mistake of transferring it in this morning before signing upSo it‚Äôs less then 12 hrs,btohqsg
I seriously doubt (but don't take my word as 100% correct) UOB will / able to look at INTRADAY funds in/out and use that for enforcing the withdraw and re-deposit rule.If i were to build UOB system  I would at most look at end of day balances to see if any were withdrawn and redeposit.so u agar agar,btohqsg
Hi canUOB Preferred PlatinumVisa earn 4mpd with contactless petrol spend at Shell?,btohqsg
Have you triedheymax.ai? Referral can be found in@sgpromocode,btohqsg
actually if you already 'accidentally' transfer in the $20k... you can just register the same day.. and don't do anything liaowhy u go and move the $20k back out again?,btohqsg
Because I thought the the fresh fund in need to be after we sign up right?,btohqsg
no ah.. the plunging chicken TNC off the back of my head isfresh fund in date or registration date  WHICH EVER LATER...,btohqsg
Now only scared your 20k not part of fresh funds already.,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 account holders who transfer out their pay on payday  does it say on the web browser salary credited already before the transfer out ? Read that it should be done by 9pm on pay day   still seeing 0.00 under salary credited...so can go ahead ? Or wait ....,btohqsg
"1.6(iii). ""30 days before and during the Promotion period""",btohqsg
Has it been at least 1 business day?,btohqsg
indeed written in black and whitebut it is really ridiculous and i don't see how they can enforce it to the letterwhat about salary crediting (condition of bonus interest)? if i transfer out my salary on the day i receive.. HOW?,btohqsg
No...credited today at 4+pm. So@MelvynEzi  need to wait to see the amount reflected under Salary credited first before transferring it out ?,btohqsg
ü§£ü§£ I mean it has been there for previous promos  maybe they cannot enforce it,btohqsg
I always withdraw on the same day. It will be captured as long as the salary is in,btohqsg

Anyone knows if the hsbc ega July promo is out? What‚Äôs the % rate,btohqsg
Hi like to check on the hsbc ega.Im currently on May promotion (not june promotion) and it will end this month on sunday.If i will to transfer to 2nd hsbc ega account (under Jun promotion)  will it be the best to transfer this sat or next Mon?As hsbc have cap of $250k  will need to do more than once.Also if i do it on next Mon 1st July  will the transfer amt consider as the 1st day of July amount and affect my sign up of the July promotion (will 1st July intended transfer amount affect the fresh funds consideration etc for Aug deposit back)Thanks,btohqsg
In other words  to do the 2 accounts method  shld i do it on last day of the month or first day of the month. Any difference esp this month end is on sunday,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
This month end is on a sunday.If i do a fast transfer on sunday   it will be consider a monkey transfer. On the daily transfer limit  the amount is based on Monday or it will still consider as sunday daily limit,btohqsg
Hi all  I saw HSBC EGA need to perform 5 transactions however I have not received my hsbc debit card yet. The account just open this Monday. Can I use the credit card to perform 5 transaction instead? I have revolution cc,btohqsg
Yes can. Or you can transfer 1 dollar out to another bank acct 5 times.,btohqsg
Yes. Or it is called FAST,btohqsg
