Its like u can have different pots to grow. Something like saving for big ticket items - travel / medical / dining,btohqsg
Like to ask is anyone having early critical illness insurance plan?I.e Paying $600 to $1k per annum. No cash payout upon maturity.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone can advice if the citi pay all If I max the 95% credit limit  and clear it and do another transaction to the max of 95% credit limit again  will that be possible?Meaning haven statement date yet,btohqsg
I believe cannot. It is by calendar month regardless if you have prepay or not. Means 95% of your permanent credit limit in a calendar month  not statement month.,btohqsg
So with this is it still worth to use if I burst it and pay the admin fee to get the 1.2md,btohqsg
Don't get ur qn? If u burst limit the transaction won't even go thru,btohqsg
Which means I clear the amount I used and do a smaller amount within the same calendar month,btohqsg
Is it worth the 1.2md if I am on premier miles and since there is a charge of 2.2%,btohqsg
Don't think it works alr mentioned in abv t and c posted. If limit 1k u can only do 95% max which is 950 on payall for that calendar mth. Any amt after can won't go through for that month even if u alr paid that 950 u used initially. Not sure but that's ehat I understand frm the t and c,btohqsg
Burst means you cannot use Citi Payall at all.You need to wait till 01 Aug 2023.,btohqsg
Any recommendations of online bank/bank that give better interest? Other than GXS Mari and trust.Looking for risk free and better liquidity  at least can withdraw when needed  not like fix deposit üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è,btohqsg
If I already UOB one acc  should i shift my funds to GXS? I see the hype in it but the interest seems lower than UOB one?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 if withdraw money and MAB compare to last month is $499.99 or less will loss 1.2%/2.4%/EIR1.5% interest.,btohqsg
Why shift? If have extra then shift extra over,btohqsg
I see suddenly gxs so hyped  so wanted to clarify if there are other aspects of it that makes it a better deal. Thanks!,btohqsg
Uob or OCBC if fully funded then go gxs,btohqsg
Uob is like playing elden ring...have to complete all the side quests and make perfect choices just to get the best ending.GXS is like animal crossing...no stress,btohqsg
Gxs ya jist put and forgettingUob is mich More lor $$ to earn so u nee do More homework and keeping track,btohqsg
hi im asking for recommendations.. I have uob 1 and ocbc 360 both salary credited. i spend more than 500. I have citi cash plus... should I cancel citi and get ocbc90n? since I want to collect miles üò•,btohqsg
maybe spend on uob lady to get 6mpd and clock to uob one account $500 spend for bonus interest?,btohqsg
I also sign up with GXS app but approved instantly,btohqsg
put 100k into UOB one and OCBC first.,btohqsg
What about the Uob Stash account? Will it be better than GXS?,btohqsg
Stash only 3% effective I think and it's not compounded. Weaker interest rate than gxs,btohqsg
Stash account cannot take out money. The moment  u withdraw 1$  become 0.05%,btohqsg
UOB stash account is a 50% FD (Flexible deposit). You are only allow to increase account balance to continue earning interest but not allow to reduce the balance(even if reduce by $0.01). Reducing balance will result you lossalmost allyour interest you supposed to earn.,btohqsg
hi  is there still the sign-up bonus of 2 500 Grab Points simply by linking GXS account?,btohqsg
We're not stopping there! We're giving away a ton of Grab and Dash reward points.To score extra reward points  simply maintain an average balance of S$500 in your Main Account of your GXS Savings Account and spend on eligible transactions on Grab and/or Singtel Dash with GXS between 19 July and 31 August 2023.,btohqsg
Now more troublesome to earn the bonus,btohqsg
wah i long time never hear grab points liao i thought this thing no more liao,btohqsg
Got notification for successful eligibility? I did the whole step and never received any in-app notification. But I called the hotline and the CSO said I should be eligible.,btohqsg
Same  but have not all cso  do you see the daily dividend?,btohqsg
Which card should I get for one motoring road tax payment ?,btohqsg
Uob absolute amex via paypal for road tax,btohqsg
Thank you Queenie  just to check for uob absolute Amex card via PayPal method  does it also work for other platforms ? Like insurance or any transaction that goes thru PayPal?,btohqsg
If there is paypal as payment option u can use uob absolute for those mcc that is usually excluded for rewards,btohqsg
I see  thank you so much for the tips. Appreciate it üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Grab limk to gxs and deduct from gxs or top up via gxs ?,btohqsg
Is there a fee charge by PayPal,btohqsg
Was previously under review as well after signing up since yesterday.Wat i juz tried was tat i downloaded the app  and sign up again using another device.In the another device  GXS prompt me login using myinfo etc  and immediately gave an instant approval wif acct number etc.Then i logoff  and re-login my old device.Its working for me already.,btohqsg
Does any one knows what card i can earn miles with for veterinary clinic / vet services? I have a dog that needs surgery and it's a big amount.,btohqsg
Don't think got other above 1.2MPD for vet services,btohqsg
I don't mind 1.2 miles also. At least its something.,btohqsg
Remember to pair with amaze though  though you should work out how much u will earn through this against a general spend card like Citi PM (i.e. if your bills exceed 1K),btohqsg
but amaze got no points for local spending right?,btohqsg
I will ask if I could split the bill into 2 payments. So 1K will definitely be 4mpd. Others will be 1.2 miles provided vet services is under whitelist of citi premiermiles,btohqsg
no point  but will be marked as online (so u get 4mpd out of it),btohqsg
It's to convert it to online spending,btohqsg
I have around $200k in SSB is it wise to shift it into GXS since it has higher interest?,btohqsg
or is gxs shady üòÄ? dwna get rugged like ftx,btohqsg
