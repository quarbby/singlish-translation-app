This post will be updated accordingly when HDB makes them available  or when someone from the community discovers them. Do check back.__In case you were wondering...1. The link(s) to your respective project brochure(s) is/are accessible via the HDB portal when you receive your appointment officially. This was how a past applicant managed to derive the URLs of all other brochures  as we can engineer them as long as we have the project names (that is  unless HDB decides to change the URL formats... again).2. Up until Feb 2023  there was a common page for all BTO brochures for that exercise  but this has been discontinued since the May 2023 exercise.__⚠️ This announcement message will be deleted and combined with themain Jun 2024 BTO postof this channel in 3 days.#jun2024,btohqsg

Hello! Any gc or admins for keat hong verge?,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone managed to take a look at sengkang October 2024 BTO plot in person?Any idea if the plot(the one closer to layar lrt) has been covered or fenced up by HDB already?,btohqsg

Meaning the HFE that is expired will still be used for the flat selection?,btohqsg
The one you used for SBF BTO resale applicationIt's ok for it to expired during your flat selection as application tire to itWhen near BTO SBF key collection HDB will inform you to create another HFE before key collection,btohqsg
thank u 🙏🏻 just got a unit there through SBF 😊,btohqsg
Is it possible to renew my HFE letter earlier? My expiry date ison 22 Octoberand I am aware that I can only renew it 30 days before expiry which will beon 22 September. However  HDB said to apply for HFEbefore 15 Septemberto apply for the October launch. I tried to cancel my HFE letter but it says that I cannot because I have used it for a flat application (Feb 2024 launch). However  the ballot number is so far from the flat supply and I am aware of the non-selection count and cancellation of other existing flat applications (including the upcoming Oct launch) if my number by miracle is due for selection. Hence why I do not really want to risk it. But I am also afraid if I waituntil 22 Septemberto renew my HFE letter  it will be too late for it to process just in time for the October launch.,btohqsg
The system will not allow earlier renew HFE  at least that's what we experienced. We were notified ard one month before expiry to apply renewal.,btohqsg
Called HDB on thisLooks like you can only apply for renewal when it available,btohqsg
Wanna check if there is any specific telegram group for kallang BTO june 2024? I got the results and would like to join the group discussion,btohqsg
Can I check if we can ballot for 1 specific project only? Or when we ballot it's for alllll the projects in the same town? Thank you!,btohqsg
All the projects in the same town if they have multiple,btohqsg
"Oh :o Okay  thank you :"")",btohqsg
Got it  appreciate the clarification :>,btohqsg
Don't need to cancel the old HFE. Just renew on 22 Sep will do.,btohqsg
Use myrequest on HDB portal to request for a change of earlier expiry  just done that,btohqsg
Is it possible to defer the sign of lease agreement to a later date?,btohqsg

Ya can but must arrange with HDB on the date,btohqsg
When does mortgage payment start ?,btohqsg
Upon signing of lease or key collection?,btohqsg
I got my HFE Approved before the new enhanced CPF housing grant was increased. Am I able to cancel my existing one and re-apply? Since they say its only available to HFE approved after 20 Aug,btohqsg
HDB and MND said home buyers who have received an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter – which indicates their eligibility to buy a flat and receive grants  as well as financing options – will not need to apply for a new one. The letter will be updated to reflect the new EHG amount.,btohqsg
Congrats to those who will be applying for the oct 2024 bto exercise onwards as you will be receving the new revise grants 🎉,btohqsg
New grant amount table  from HDB's website,btohqsg
Singles still most discriminated … earning above 4.5k no grants Liao …,btohqsg
Is it better to apply under old loans limits/grantsor new loan limits/grants?,btohqsg
Any idea about the staggered payment,btohqsg
Good point. Grant is good for those with lower income. High income benefit from higher loan.,btohqsg
I got a friend who’s married to foreigner wife … his salary is slightly above the grant threshold of 4.5k and yet he can barely afford most 3rm resale flat based on his salary alone …,btohqsg
For me new grants/loan better. Will benefit most people,btohqsg
No choice one . I also married foreigner wife. But i know i can't afford resale so we luckily have a child born after 1yr of marriage  then can apply BTO can get. After BTO get apply PR easier. My wife is a PR now..,btohqsg
