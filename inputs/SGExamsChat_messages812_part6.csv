is the person who teaches engineering physics,btohqsg
i cannot think of anyone else,btohqsg
my prof also does education ftr,btohqsg
i remember when he taught me EM one of his FYP students was testing out a teaching method as part of his project,btohqsg
Aren't you doing like Quantum Electrodynamics or smth like that,btohqsg
Idk im naming stuff to sound intelligent,btohqsg
yeah he collabs with NIE people for that,btohqsg
Chapter 1 of studying it in week 13,btohqsg
Idk I recall something about it being related to optics like quantum optics or smth,btohqsg
i closed the online text immediately,btohqsg
You already know more about it than i do,btohqsg
i think is like quantum binary stuff.,btohqsg
I just am listing off my understanding of Newton's physics in relation to Optics,btohqsg
is like you know bits have 0 and 1s,btohqsg
Cuz that's what my 4k mod was about,btohqsg
you know what is alson fascinating,btohqsg
i mean bc of the area of quantum computing i work in  i do use a lot of quantum optics,btohqsg
I see quantum I know is too advanced and much later work for me liao,btohqsg
may y3s1 bless you with the same,btohqsg
Nah i should be the one saying that,btohqsg
I am fr gon turn into a passport bro at this rate,btohqsg
No juniors should ever complain about failing anymore,btohqsg
Because if i somehow made it through a mod without answering any questions in a finals,btohqsg
i want this internship thing to be over,btohqsg
i cannot survive working 9 to 5 pm,btohqsg
Ikr it's such a dumb thing,btohqsg
it's where i get to walk past your paper and shake my head to see your reaction,btohqsg
You guys pay 8k per year just to get your paper marked,btohqsg
It should be 100% CA only,btohqsg
pls dont do that  pls dont be like prof csa,btohqsg
Side note this is basically how non stem works,btohqsg
it's not been that long since i was in your position so,btohqsg
man already has been disappoint and sat at the front taking a nap,btohqsg
Just that it is damn anal cuz u gotta attend everything,btohqsg
CSA walks past my paper and saw that i have written nothing for the past 1 hour,btohqsg
but you know what is annoying,btohqsg
the onyl A+ i got was from cc7,btohqsg
Why would you inflict such emotional damage,btohqsg
(Sorry icc pulls up my gpa),btohqsg
This is where the prof discovers he has seen new students outside the 13 weeks of class,btohqsg
The first statement is not even fulfilled ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
"""i did not know physics students exist""-the career coach for spms",btohqsg
But they do pull up my gpa,btohqsg
it's ok your y3s1 is really cursed,btohqsg
It does because it is a conditional statement based on pulling up your GPA,btohqsg
It's saying u like it only BECAUSE it raises your GPA,btohqsg
our cheat sheet is a tiny placard bro,btohqsg
I can not like something but still reap its benefits,btohqsg
But in this case reaping the benefits entails liking ICC,btohqsg
taugeh does not reap benefits  it rapes my tongue,btohqsg
