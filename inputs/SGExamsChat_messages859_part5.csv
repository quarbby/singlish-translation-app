i forgot what was the rule,btohqsg
The contrasting was really what killed people,btohqsg
i feel like yall could have survived yi's promotion criteria tho ngl,btohqsg
Even people who got 3h2 pass and failed their contrast was a CONDITIONAL promotion,btohqsg
"cus if i am not wrong  our standard is ""no U grade can alr""",btohqsg
so technically mi promotion criteria is a lot harsher,btohqsg
My principal was pretty dogass back then,btohqsg
Eg y2 to y3 its 2h2 pass,btohqsg
If your other h2 was 44,btohqsg
oh for us  we just prefer the previous principal  not the current one,btohqsg
You call your mom dad come down to cry for you also no point,btohqsg
oh actually we had one person whose parents came to our school,btohqsg
Yeah she was ruthless ðŸ¥²Luckily I nvr retain at all,btohqsg
and then he miraculously got promoted even though he retained,btohqsg
(of course  yall know how he fare for A levels in the end),btohqsg
Seeing how well you did for As,btohqsg
But she encouraged me on grad day say arts stream students usually do well,btohqsg
You must be a regular wings award achiever,btohqsg
Nah never got one at all,btohqsg
I did GEL and essays are painful to write,btohqsg
Always puts a smile on my face when i hear an MI student do well,btohqsg
Haha so I think I can disrupt if I want to? Tempted to to siam the upcoming foreign exercises in the second half of the year,btohqsg
As long as your foreign exercises are after uni starts,btohqsg
You can only disrupt 1 week prior to orientation i think,btohqsg
i think can try asking like your superiors about it if not maybe the manpower asas?,btohqsg
And you need a letter from the smu stating that,btohqsg
cus i think the manpower clerk ppl may roughly know the conditions for disruption,btohqsg
Haha seeing the manpower they cfm wonâ€™t let me,btohqsg
Like you need a letter from them stating the exact school starting date i think,btohqsg
they just want to milk me dry,btohqsg
So you needa email smu hr and whatnot,btohqsg
But dont quote me on this  please go ask your ASAs,btohqsg
Not sure what are ASAs cuz Iâ€™m in navy,btohqsg

But I was posted to navy after BMT,btohqsg
Office workers that deal with this,btohqsg
My math teacher who taught me in fact now teacher in MI ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I am fascinated and definitely curious actually,btohqsg
Teaching MI students is a new kind of patience,btohqsg
Iâ€™d rather teach than sign on,btohqsg
Iâ€™d teach A Level literature  knowledge and inquiry etc,btohqsg
