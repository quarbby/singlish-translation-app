too dragged down by life to bother about a chat group rn,btohqsg
Why is everything to you about relationships,btohqsg
It's where I excel I suppose,btohqsg
but if y'all think that these kinds of conversations are appropriate for a chat group meant for students between the age of 15-19  then ya go ahead,btohqsg
if relationships convo then yes its more than appropriate for 15 and above,btohqsg
Because that‚Äôs how it be sometimes,btohqsg
But you enlisting next week right,btohqsg
I just don't want the chat to go into extreme levels of detail,btohqsg
because apparently that's all that youths nowadays are caught up with,btohqsg
i mean to be fair 15-19 yr olds have RS and then when break up its like the end of the world,btohqsg
"part of ite tagline: ""hearts on  hands on  minds on""",btohqsg
As you age relationships aren‚Äôt the world to you anymore,btohqsg
Sad that you lose the romantic sentimentality,btohqsg
Good that you become less obsessive,btohqsg
That‚Äôs how it be when all u want is someone to love u,btohqsg
good too to become jaded? HAHA,btohqsg
Jaded is just another word for realist,btohqsg
i hv a friend the sister 28 29 still single tho,btohqsg
