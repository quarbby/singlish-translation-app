Unless I can find where to park the utilities portion I still can earn the 0.25 😂,btohqsg
If you solely use that card for utilities  will the cashback be able to break even with annual fee?,btohqsg
So far the didnt come bug me for annual fee. So not my consideration,btohqsg
First 2 years waived. Unless your utilities is $833 per month  else not worth to keep if not using.,btohqsg

Hi  any miles or cashback card I can use to earn for optical shops?,btohqsg
I don’t have crmc 🥲 does uob lady’s (fashion category)  hsbc revolution  Amex true cashback or sc unlimited cashback earn anything?,btohqsg
What about uob ppv or uob vs?,btohqsg
Lady’s fashion category might but I’d check with heymax or smth for the mcc,btohqsg
Then should have said what cc you have. Amex or SC card should earn cashback.,btohqsg
The shop not on heymax. Thanks anyway!,btohqsg
UOB lady fashion doesn't cover 8043 like owndays. Best is to use something like crmc with amaze or UOB PPV mobile contactless.,btohqsg
Damn just got approved for UOB evol and it’s getting nerfed,btohqsg
Same last time when I got DBS Live fresh just a few days before it get nerf. Card kept in drawer since.,btohqsg

Hello! If we use cardup to pay income tax  do we need to go IRAS site to indicate GIRO payment by monthly instalment? Or can just apply via Cardup?,btohqsg
Yes need to setup monthly GIRO payment plan before applying CardUp.,btohqsg
If you do 1 time tax payment  can do just via cardup. Giro is recommended for backup purpose.,btohqsg
Using credit card pay for income tax consider spend?,btohqsg

Thanks for confirming! I just discovered that the eCapitaVoucher purchase is under MCC 6540 POI funding transaction and thus excluded from earning dbs points. Any folks here can share how to earn bonus points (miles) for buying eCapitaVoucher pls?,btohqsg
Credit card requires to spend$XXin order to get the welcome bonus. I was wondering using it to pay for income tax does it consider as part of the$XX.,btohqsg
I heard can buy ecapita from wogi and get cc miles,btohqsg
Can watch this to understand credit card min spend requirements  including ecapitavoucherhttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82I,btohqsg
If you meant using cc to pay income tax via cardup will meet welcome bonus spend  check individual tnc. Some cc don't reward cardup for welcome bonus.,btohqsg
only Amex Capitastar card will give rewards for buying Capitastar vouchers (directly from Capitamalls). WAIT FOR PROMOS.Yes Wogi is an alternative.,btohqsg

Hi all   wanted to ask for the instarem amaze+mastercard vs instarem amaze wallet option. I tried both options(transactions were made 15mins apart on the same day) in Malaysia last month and the exchange rates on both had a 2% difference (amaze+master having a lower fx). Any idea if it's still worth to tag a mastercard to accumulate miles?,btohqsg
It is know to have 2 percent difference in spot rate for wallet and link card option,btohqsg
worth it if mastercard earns more than 2%,btohqsg
i'm surprised only a 2% difference was observed  since amaze wallet > MYR is usually better than MC rates,btohqsg
amaze wallet now has MYR in-wallet  using their own rate. generally better than MC's own rate and closer to spot,btohqsg
does amaze wallet if u use sgd auto convert and then make payment? i realise if i just top up sgd in amaze wallet  even if i dont convert it to myr  the conversion rate they give if i link amaze to wallet is very goodlike better than if i convert using their conversion thingalso way better than if i link to credit card,btohqsg
Worth if linking 4mpd Mastercard with amaze.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check if ocbc 360 account can use paynow transfer for salary credit ?,btohqsg
Yes. You can search the chat for the steps,btohqsg
"if your transaction currency is a wallet currency  yes. you will see 2 transactions in your history  one conversion transaction and one debit transactionthere should be no difference from their ""conversion thing"" unless you mean the rate is different from their remittance function",btohqsg
Hi all  I have participated in the previous UOB Rising Dragon promotion and the earmarked period supposed to be ended on 17 June 2024. I have not seen my fund get reflected yet  could anyone have experienced this before? Thank you.,btohqsg
Nicee so i dont need to convert and atore any currency  just keep sgd there good enough  thanks!,btohqsg
yesterday holiday.. give UOB chance please.. check tomorrow laanyway as long as u see it under ACCOUNT BALANCE.. no worries,btohqsg
you can convert to lock in a good rate (like youtrip) but not necessary,btohqsg
his is the other way.. he waiting for release,btohqsg
Does the UOB app display the end date when the ear mark supposed to finish? I dont see that.,btohqsg
no it won't.. have to rely on the table.based on my memory.. the earmark is released ONE DAY after the official datee.g. if it stated 18th June 2024  you can only see the release on 19th June 2024 (day hours  not at 12.01am).but if it is 17th June 2024 (public holiday)  maybe +1 day la.. give chance please,btohqsg
