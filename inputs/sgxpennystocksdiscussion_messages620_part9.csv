"Whoever wrote this post..deserves a medal..👌👏👏👏.....👇""We are a little dot that cannot be found on the map.The sooner we learn not to take sides and stay neutral would be wiser.Feeling enraged and wanting to right a wrong personally is a virtue  but is there a need to decide this for the entire SG future?It was not too long ago we also supported the invasion of Iraq  Afghanistan  Lybia  Syria.......how had all that turned out?Did any of our leaders who made that decision apologize  felt sorry  or contributed their life savings to compensate for the loss and suffering of the people in those countries?So we are just like the USA  simply brush it off as a mistake  given wrong info by the CIA?You ministers made us feel very good about ourselves  destroying another country because you thought it's RIGHT at that time.Singaporeans are peace-loving people  kind  and mostly very generous.I am sure we all empathize with the Ukrainians.But as a dot on the map  we would rather our govt be smarter and not louder.Be an advocate for peace than take sides.Be observant and learn more than being too quick to pass judgment.I like to send love and well wishes to the people of Ukraine.I also like to apologize to the people of Russia for the folly of my government.I hope you guys sort out your problems soon and learn to appreciate each other as neighbors.I also like to tell our FM that  being the first in ASEAN  and shouting the loudest to sanction Russia score few points but instead showed his inexperience.Russia is not a small rock in the Straits of Johore.Russia is not another PritamSingh that you guys can simply bully without consequences.Before you announce that heroic sanction  have you spared a second on the repercussions?Did you spare a thought of the possible Singaporeans  businesses  students  travelers that are still in Russia  whose life may be in danger because of your announcement?Maybe it will be more helpful if you spend more energy trying to make peace  and also help arrange for the evacuation of Singaporeans and spouses of Singaporeans to safety instead.Please make Singapore a peace-loving country.....Not the other way around.""👍乌教授说的好 在乌俄之战朋友的朋友不见的会是你的朋友敌人的敌人未必就是你的敌人小国在乌俄之战应不沾锅 也不选边才是明智之举👏👏👏獅城国小声特大 过度的“标榜”正义 未必是上上策老美笑在心里北极熊记在心里老中看在眼里",btohqsg
