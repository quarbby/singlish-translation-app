I guess it's targeted. I didn't get this email.,btohqsg
So work or doesn‚Äôt work. Very confused hahaha. Asking about ocbc account  and personal bank paynow transfer haha,btohqsg

Hi! Can I confirm for the trust cashback card it is 1.5% for new customers and 1% for existing customers regardless of the amount spent?,btohqsg
I use agoda for hotels only  not flights,btohqsg
not agoda but usedtrip.comto book most of my prev flights  so far no issue and slightly cheaper than booking both separate üòÖ and easier to manage imo,btohqsg
For Uob privilege miles card  do you find that Expedia is really much more expensive and not able to provide the same flights as Skyscanner. It‚Äôs hard to find the best flight for the 6mpd,btohqsg

From a few of my flight bookings on Expedia  I find price is around the same with airlines. And 6mpd got credited immediately when transactions were posted.,btohqsg
yes provided not selected bonus category,btohqsg
Trip.comis more favorable due to their huge amount of discount codes. But only book there if you are sure about the flights.,btohqsg
wah smell like the very very early days of DBS Live Fresh! Card...The unique design though......I think the only drawback im concerned here is the customer support....,btohqsg
Yup..hahaha but a worse version. Still better than nothing,btohqsg
never heard of anyone getting it before,btohqsg
Have. Search chat can find. But only remember seeing 1 pax. Or maybe I remembered wrongly. ü§£,btohqsg
Hi  does the ocbc acc average daily balance increase of $500 also take into account the bonus interest credited each month?,btohqsg
Yes. Remember that base interest credits end of month and bonus interest credits after 1st week of next month.,btohqsg
Suggest you don't make it complicated and just deposit $500 (+ a bit for buffer) on the first day. Withdraw the bonus interest when it's deposited.,btohqsg
Same. I usually put in 750 at the beginning of the month. Easier to keep track.,btohqsg

If t&c states not excluded then have,btohqsg

hi all  any thoughts about this card as compared to YouTrip and Trust card for overseas spending?,btohqsg
Yeah let me try again to summarise. This card has 2 functions1. Use as a debit card linked to Uob one savings account. It will auto deduct in sgd when u spend in foreign currencies. You need to turn off auto conversion into wallets so it will trigger as a fx transaction (3.25+0.8 fee) and u can earn 3.25% cashback. Stupid!2 use as a debit card linked to mighty fx accounts which are like YouTrip. U have to convert before hand. Or turn on auto conversion feature. If u use this function. No cashback. Fx rates are comparable to google rates.,btohqsg
Thank you  Sir for the explanation üôèüèª,btohqsg
Hahaha I actually forgot the very old benefits but now that I checked  it's definitely better.,btohqsg
Hi Melvyn  coming back to this. Sorry to ask a silly question.I checked difference between monthly and yearly premium is about 2.5% difference in cost. So does it mean if cardup/ipaymy charge lower means i should use them. Difference cost is around $10++ actually.,btohqsg
If you want to calc further  your money staying in the bank can earn interest :),btohqsg
Lol changing to monthly and charging through CardUp would mean at least 4% in fees. Do you think you can beat that with any of the cashback cards?,btohqsg
errrr. not that i can think off. maximum maybank also 3.33%,btohqsg
some fun calculations. Assume 3.3% pa saving account  you actually only pay 1% more with monthly plan. And you can pay your maybank bill via giro HSBC EGA.Ofc  this assumes interest wont drop further (unlikely)  cardup stays the same  EGA stays the same.,btohqsg
Hi guys  I'm trying to plan to use my cc mileage to travel from SG to OSAKA (Business Class). I saw that booking under Eva Air's Star Alliance member it will net me 40k miles (which is also SQ). While booking it via SQ will net me 45k miles. Any idea why is there a 5k difference?,btohqsg
oh wait  the booking under SQ is 70k for Advantage... so its actually a 30k miles difference,btohqsg
different frequent flyer programs will have their own award chart. Its known KF is usually higher cost in miles than other partner program.Have you compared tax?,btohqsg
I haven't gotten to the checkout part yet! Wanted to seek the opinions here maybe your are more experienced!,btohqsg
Because i haven't cash out my miles from the cc yet haha so i can't see how much the tax will cost (need to have enough miles to see in EVA Air),btohqsg
ya it is known KF miles cost for same flight redemption sometimes is higher. You may get more values by transferring to other frequent flyer program. But then  KF is the easiest to access (all SG banks can transfer to KF). Other members can suggest more min maxing of FFP redemption üôÇ,btohqsg
SQ business saver is 52k  not 45k,btohqsg
