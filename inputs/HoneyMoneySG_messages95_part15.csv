I wonder am I correct. Based on tnc  paying singtel bill and singpost services are excluded from uob one account bonus interest and card rewards. Not sure why it considered as qualifying spend under uob one account bonus interest. So that means they are qualifying spend for uob one card cashback reward?I tried singtel bill payment with ocbc 90N and it awarded me ocbc miles too.,btohqsg
SingTel bills will earn 3.33% cash rebate on Uob one card and move the Uob one bonus interest counter.,btohqsg
Oh so singtel is not excluded transaction for uob one cc. Always thought telco and utilities are generally excluded,btohqsg
SingTel bills are not excluded for almost all credit cards that I‚Äôm aware off.However  telco payments may be excluded from many adhoc spend and redeem promotions,btohqsg
Yes. Just Vietnam not many place accept card.,btohqsg
Oh how does it work ? So hsbc revo is 4mpd and using it with kris means 5mpd (extra 1mpd?)and every transaction will be converted to contactless/online payment automatically?,btohqsg
And I believe another condition is your parents should not have more than 4k salary for the year.,btohqsg
Citi SMRT if Kris+ or XNAP or ShopBack via Apple Pay not eligible right?,btohqsg
