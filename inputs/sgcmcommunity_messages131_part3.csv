look at the condition  send in for a Pre Purchase Inspection at a specialist workshop or a workshop you trust and then basis the report negotiate,btohqsg
cause cheap when they buy then market shoot up and kdm did well cause they didn't start looking dated unlike the jap alternatives and some contis *ahem* merc c class and others *ahem*,btohqsg
wa dun lowball the dealer until like that lah,btohqsg
use COE then divide + ARF + Body value see how much  then u see dealer profit margin how much  then u see from there,btohqsg
always ask if price is negotiable cus some dealers dont negotiate,btohqsg

but then their car condition good,btohqsg
I see... thank you for the advices!,btohqsg

HI guys  wanna know if PPI more reliable or STA Evaluation check?,btohqsg
many of us will not be able to own one as well.,btohqsg
Soon will not be able to own one,btohqsg
If u have a reliable workshop PPI,btohqsg
But not all dealers allow PPI by ur own workshop,btohqsg
so i requested for STA check instead,btohqsg
should i still request for this?after the STA Check?,btohqsg
But you went for STA check alr ah,btohqsg
u ask some of the honda bros here,btohqsg
sorry idk any  honda specialist workshops :),btohqsg
actually if u have doubts about the dealer  u shud just dont buy the car,btohqsg
dont let a $500 loss become a $50k loss,btohqsg
Yah recommended too. I driving a honda.,btohqsg
any idea how much does it roughly cost to do SKM PPI?,btohqsg
not sure if will too late anot  i sign agreement if STA check is graded B above  then everything will proceed as usual...if below B then they will cancel the deal and refund me,btohqsg
Dont ever rush into buying a car. Now outside so many car,btohqsg
my own ws cudnt fix my car. i had to go to a specialist. they fix it now no issue le,btohqsg

Guys where can I buy this,btohqsg
Now that you've already signed this for sta  unlikely the dealer will let you ppi at specialist,btohqsg
