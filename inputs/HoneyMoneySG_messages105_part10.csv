Don't have Amex. Well I kinda maybe still pay it with the card and ask customer service if its okie,btohqsg
U can pay just no reward or count to spending loh,btohqsg
Yea sadly no choice lor. I checked even ocbc also exclude 9399. Just hoping might have surprise or just let it be,btohqsg
Most bank exclude 9399 except uob absolute which give 0.3 or amex tcb which give 1.5,btohqsg
The reason for exclusion list is very simple  bank charges those cat lower fee and dont justify to give card user reward on it. No one want to do a losing business right.,btohqsg
If Jun empty out left min balance will not affect interest payout right?,btohqsg
Not sure then. U need to use Amaze empty wallet to find out.,btohqsg

Hey guys  anyone know how I can sign up online for HSBC EGA? Seems like can't for folks that hold only a hsbc revolution card. Thank you,btohqsg
Yea you can still download their hsbc app and then apply the ega account. If it doesn't work you just have to open it physically at the branch,btohqsg
Nope. You need to open at branch. Because you have an existing HSBC credit card.,btohqsg

not sure if spent online will be applicable??,btohqsg
That's right. You need to send via PayNow and only do it on their website. The app won't count.I'm assuming you are transferring to UOB One?,btohqsg
You can check the t&c for exclusions.,btohqsg
ooh okok. but dbs app and website does have the SALA transfer under fund transfer,btohqsg
so means that using DBS/POSB will be much easier? haha,btohqsg
can use dbs livefresh in electronic/IT stores to get 6% and clock to sign up bonus if spend min $800 in a month,btohqsg

Hey guys  since UOB One lowered the interest rates. Just wondering  if there is any better alternative to park the money at elsewhere?,btohqsg
So did the bank giro for ega still work?,btohqsg
This has been discussed countless times over last 2 months. You can search in the history for these information.,btohqsg
But that is a good card isn't it? And I just checked  can make payment via giro. Then should be able to combine with EGA. That will be 2% + 1% = 3% cashback,btohqsg

Hello Everyone  how do i get my cpf money back from insurance agent if the agent MIA?,btohqsg
Background: i invested my cpf with an insurance company. I realise the ROI is not good. Now i want to invest it myself with endowus or DBS bond,btohqsg
"If the agent ""mia"" as in they are ghosting you (still part of company)  you can call in to the company and tell them you want to cancel policy but your agent mia.If the agent already left the company  they usually will assign someone in their group to take over  usually can find their contact on their website or app.",btohqsg
Hi  I own self terminate two policies last yr by doing it online. Depends on whether the insurance company has online portal to DIY. I received my CPF within a month after I submitted,btohqsg
Empty on the 1st morning will do.,btohqsg

It lists for some vendors and it doesn‚Äôt for some others. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm confused how to calculate my eligible spending.,btohqsg

Thanks  found it.  But CDC only allow top up in the app via paynow and nets  no way to charge to credit card  anyone know how ?,btohqsg
