Fk it go back to coal powered,btohqsg
in the end it's the next generation that's suffering,btohqsg
if you consume 10L of diesel going the same distance you're letting out half the emissions,btohqsg
fuck it we do it flintstones style,btohqsg
just wear thicc ass shoes and walk yourself there,btohqsg
i want to be one with the ground,btohqsg
straight pipe diesel sounds hella cool,btohqsg
i miss when cool diesels were a thing,btohqsg
i mean i took my entire muffler off and it made no difference,btohqsg
cause the DPF and cat were strangling it so much,btohqsg
should just remove my muffler entirely and go inspection,btohqsg
watch as vicom tries to probe a nonexistent exhaust,btohqsg
Yup  I have yet to board one this year,btohqsg
the VW XL1 was neat too,btohqsg
only logical if you have money,btohqsg
more than 4 cylinders means you need money alr,btohqsg
4 cylinder european diesels are already a maintenance nightmare because of how much they have going on in the engine bay,btohqsg
not because the engine is a heap,btohqsg
but its a pain in the ass to work on,btohqsg
surprisingly the merc diesels can go on forever though,btohqsg
most engines will go forever if maintained frequently,btohqsg
the 212 diesel cabs we have can hit 1.6+ million kms,btohqsg
always take warmup and cooldown seriously,btohqsg
and i don't mean sit in the carpark for 10 minutes,btohqsg
shit maintenance schedule to boot too,btohqsg
30 secs for oil to flow,btohqsg
just cold start and whack limiter,btohqsg
drive gently for next 10 mins,btohqsg
and then send it for the rest of the journey,btohqsg
it is important that diesels are driven HARD to keep them healthy,btohqsg
people starting tonner first thing in the morning and sending the pistons through the roof,btohqsg
proper warmup procedure> start car> ensure rev limiter works immediately> ensure it works throughout the drive,btohqsg
saf paid for limiter  use the limiter,btohqsg
sometimes the first step is unachievable already,btohqsg
with enough cursing and swearing it will start,btohqsg
> start car> car no start> VOR,btohqsg
i just achieved 220k on my french diesel last night,btohqsg
never opened  0 CEL faults since day 1,btohqsg
frequently driven at 3x the speed limit,btohqsg
its due for many things which i absolutely dread,btohqsg
cos that means spending an entire day UNDER the damn thing cursing and swearing,btohqsg
i don't have a lift i only have a floor jack and stands,btohqsg
but i'm thankful none of those things are the engine,btohqsg
its just consumables like bearings  brakes  bushings  balljoints,btohqsg
a rarity for something that's viva la france honestly,btohqsg
french diesels commonly find their way into many things,btohqsg
ford and volvo 1.6 diesel cars use the peugeot DV series engine,btohqsg
the same DV4 that's in the berlingo van,btohqsg
had a friend whose dad had a kangoo  engine blew up within 2 months LOL,btohqsg
was it the very old one,btohqsg
