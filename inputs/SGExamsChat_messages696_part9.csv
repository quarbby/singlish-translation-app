So like if recorded video I will be super unproductive,btohqsg
Also right at home there will likely be more distractions,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why I would think making an effort to attend the class live itself then rewatching the recorded video later if need be is better,btohqsg
i think youâ€™re projecting a bit,btohqsg
To each their own I guess,btohqsg
@kohsyanlast time my senpai was supposed to help me with math ended in 30min tea session about fcp and school admin,btohqsg
Only if like the student is so tired or if theyâ€™re unwell and they canâ€™t absorb much then donâ€™t go for live,btohqsg
Btw he is from drakon so i think he will be happy if i told him drakon won 2x in 2024,btohqsg
In sch have more distractions (eg. Fcp),btohqsg
a lot of people just canâ€™t focus and absorb in live lessons,btohqsg
they donâ€™t have to be unwell,btohqsg
Honestly for math  if for group tuition the Cher doesnâ€™t even bother going around to let students clarify their doubts itâ€™s likely a red flag,btohqsg
Math needs a lot of practice and on the spot feedback,btohqsg
Nvm I let the instrusive thoughts win,btohqsg
My sch h1 math only have tutorials ðŸ’€,btohqsg
RI every thing is prerecorded online lectures,btohqsg
ye sumtimes if i dont pre read got liddat,btohqsg
every1 thr shld be self driven enuff anyways,btohqsg
Idk i dont take h1 math,btohqsg
Lectures itâ€™s so hard to get personalised help,btohqsg
Ngl history lectures are the only lectures I pay attention in,btohqsg
ye maybe putting it on too much of a pedestal lol,btohqsg
For h1 history everything was done in my tutorial class,btohqsg
So can easily ask the Cher questions,btohqsg
I find my a levels experience so weird,btohqsg
The subjects I hate I do well,btohqsg
The subjects I like end up being crappy,btohqsg
just feel like we cannot project our experiences with how we feel classes should be run onto everyone,btohqsg
find the way that works for you and run with it,btohqsg
Have you done other subj hw in pw/gp/cce before,btohqsg
for physics i usually just go through and finish the stuff then when i get far ahead enough,btohqsg
Well Iâ€™m sorry if I did appear to do it. But Iâ€™m quite sure based on what Iâ€™ve seen around me live classes  be it zoom or on site  appears to be favoured by most over pre recorded especially for non humans subjects. You wonâ€™t find most students just buying pre recorded videos from tuition centres and not attending any live classes.,btohqsg
