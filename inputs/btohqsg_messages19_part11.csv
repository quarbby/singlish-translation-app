So we better pick a location we wanted to stay for Long untill we passed away,btohqsg
Hai guys any updates for woodland bro champions green?,btohqsg

HDB will extend the validity of all existing and new flat eligibility letters to 9 months  up from the current 6 months  to give flat buyers more time to secure their home.https://str.sg/iNwt,btohqsg
Only Short lease (15-45years) cannot be sold in open market,btohqsg
if you think you'll be single for the rest of your life  take 2room. if you choose 3room  the extra room that you have can rent out for investment/retirement but not for 2room.,btohqsg
Only my suggestion  you have to decide by considering what you really need or want. If you are a young person  and working  go for 3 room. As someone mentioned  can rent out one room if need money. But if you are 50 and above  go for 2 room.,btohqsg
ya i know but it rly depends on one circumstance & finance.,btohqsg
Oh 99yr 2rm flexi can be sell on open Market?,btohqsg
Ya  I'm singles working but 50 already so I think most will stay in This 2rm flexi hope location is goodPlus if 2rm even 99yr cheaper vs a 3rm I get more $ after sell mine existing flats,btohqsg
Oh then 2rm would be good for you. Cheaper housing so that you'll have more cash for retirement,btohqsg
You can rent out whole unit after the 5 year MOP right?,btohqsg
Hi guys   I understand now that the hfe letter validity will be extended. But if my partner has a change in income  does that mean we need to apply for a new hfe letter?,btohqsg
Hi  I couldn't click next page when filling in HFE application Part 3. When occupier is unemployed  I select 0 job  the Employment status no dropdown to select  hence save or Next button is not available to click and proceed. Anyone experience the similar issue?,btohqsg
Nope u can update yr HFE,btohqsg

Another reno event coming. Seems like they are targeting BTO only! Got $8 888 luckydraw sia😲😲 somemore got Wells also!!,btohqsg
Also curious whether it's really that bad?,btohqsg
Just curious if I'm now 50yr old  buy 2room flexi with mine parent around 75yr oldIf after parents passed on will the House owner still belong to me,btohqsg
When I applying I willl put myself as owners and parent as occupies,btohqsg
Flexi got no resale value  it is worst than 99 years.,btohqsg
It's like prepaid rental for x years,btohqsg
So consider as buy and forget don't consider selling off beside selling back to hdb to take back something,btohqsg
3rm but no willing pay mire for 3rm want more retire sum after sell existing fast,btohqsg
Speaking of Reno. Please choose your ID wisely. don't see cheap only whack.,btohqsg
Usually alot of them  price low. Quotation exclude alot of things. Behind u realise alot of things excluded  then end up need to add on. Then u top up until become like  more than 50%. Those w freebies also  marketing gimmick at times. Take note.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. May I know how to deal with this issue as we can't tell what they really excluded  only do halfway then will know. Is it ask any hidden cost before even signing? Can they still say no but after that tell us after signing contract?,btohqsg
New owners really quite hard to differentiate. They can say no. Then behind tell u all sorts of things then u half way Reno alrdy lol.But I tot some helpful tips:1. Ask the ID for portfolio2. See the ID experience3. Don't go for cheapo deals. Even if u wanna go  make sure the ID has years of experience.4. See the company reputation on various platformsSome will go carousel find contractors then ownself try to manage. Usually alot of unknown blind spot if try to DIY. Unless do alot of research.,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Actually reviews not everytime accurate too. Heard they call ppl to write good things too or purposely smear other competitor reputations.,btohqsg
Yah. Best is people recommend personally etc,btohqsg
Cause sometimes  company can be established  ID cui. Some ID good  but the company cui.,btohqsg
True. Even case trust ones not that trustworthy as I saw recently newspaper put case trust don't take consumer complains seriously  like useless.,btohqsg
I think as long end of the day got renovate accordingly  even slightly more expensive   also better than those who take deposit n MIA,btohqsg
Case trust  the most small claim only.,btohqsg
Hire lawyer also no use sometimes. U bleed more. So really .. ya. Usually MIA ones not much alrdy. But bad at project management ones  alot. And since ID is a lucrative industry  everyone wants to have a pie. Anyone will call themselves an ID these days. U see profiles from all over  claiming to be ID.Tts why I say  see the ID experience. Sometimes when they talk  u will know experienced or sales talk alrdy,btohqsg
I see..sigh... thanks for sharing these useful info!,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing! Best to find those with transparent pricing upfront?,btohqsg
And don forget in which alot of people overlook. Never engage your ID friends or families. Unless u wanna throw your relationship with em away.,btohqsg

Yea. so true. Seasoned ID also knows this. It's an unspoken rule. Actually in business  as long as is own friend or family members  alot of times  it is better to engage people we dunno. Even contractors etc,btohqsg
