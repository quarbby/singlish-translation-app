his daily is a Dacia Duster,btohqsg
most of the rich have normal beaters.,btohqsg
Probably but can't tell which one,btohqsg
Yeah they have dacia  regular French cars and European stuff,btohqsg
I think so  cheapest daily cars,btohqsg
yes. relatively disposable too. cheap materials all round but a reliable car,btohqsg
We came over here with my friends 4th gen Clio so that says a lot,btohqsg
Other than that  it just drives wherever you need it's alright üëç,btohqsg
decent car. shit power but torquey.,btohqsg
drove one of those when i was in thailand awhile back.,btohqsg
gets you from A-B so thats what matters,btohqsg
If you talk about monaco I haven't seen old bmws but France there's lotta e36 lovers  e30 more rare and then I can say we have more e46 than sg,btohqsg
i think yalll have more everyt than sg,btohqsg

Believe it or not  I came across an underground supermarket that happens to sell pizza and kebab so that's what I got for 5 bucks and its pretty good!,btohqsg
however ironically  the FD2R commercials were filmed at Paul Ricard.,btohqsg
wish we had more highlanders here they‚Äôre cool,btohqsg
Yeah it comes rare these days 5 buck kebab,btohqsg
size wise they don't make that much sense,btohqsg
Yeah  today I woke up in Milan  later in the afternoon go Switzerland,btohqsg
today i woke up with an empty wallet,btohqsg
sense is overrated yes. but try parking a highlander in your MSCP,btohqsg
They don't sell fries where I got it ajajjaha but its just lettuce tomato onion and cheese inside with any sauce u like,btohqsg
i still dk how s class mfs park,btohqsg
W221 and later they are relatively easy to,btohqsg
Lake como  then the mountains  furka pass,btohqsg
they have reverse sensors all round. easy game.,btohqsg
anything post 2005 is decent imo.,btohqsg
even our old 07 X3 had reverse sensors already,btohqsg
Come over  as a Turkish I'll get u some real good,btohqsg
if you cant park a car with reverse sensors you don't deserve a license lol.,btohqsg
You need to get to Paris actually  by the time you get to Switzerland I'll be gone ajjajaj,btohqsg
No it's well over now hahaha,btohqsg
Oh yeah the guy is jeremstar because of exotic animal use  the usual,btohqsg

wow havent seen this guy in a while,btohqsg
thats y im a crack addict,btohqsg
my fav type of weed is,btohqsg
bruh i think last i see this car was like grey or smtg idk if it‚Äôs the right one tho,btohqsg
hi js asking.. if idk the owner of the car/didnt ask but i post their car on like tt or ig or social media with or without blocking their carplate   is it wrong? (not saying i did but i just wanna know before i do anything that can be badüò≠) sry if its a stupid qnüò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Why do I feel this warmth is a little... to much?,btohqsg
it's best to block but honestly speaking i doubt half the people would care unless you're trespassing,btohqsg
i see people casually posting C&K meets without blurring the plates lol,btohqsg
but if you want to prevent kbws from being anal then yeah  block the plates,btohqsg
else i doubt the general population would give a fuck,btohqsg
The other opinion is that it should be the responsibility of the owner to use a plate cover should they really be concerned about their identity. Car meets have been going around for years and its not new that people come to take photos/videos,btohqsg
it's technically public information. i don't see the fuss,btohqsg
unless of course you have their NRIC and all to view the log cards,btohqsg
Notice carefully and u will see a plate,btohqsg
guys please give my good hot wheel location i js saw a tiktok a guy found the datsun at kiddy place,btohqsg
