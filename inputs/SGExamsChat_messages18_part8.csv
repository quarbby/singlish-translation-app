You teach him what subject anyway ah?,btohqsg
Y u bully small children teach h3 chem to sec 1 kid,btohqsg
i january started teaching him  then by end feb I alr finished his school's year 1 syllabus,btohqsg
Raise him to be the monster you know he can be,btohqsg
doesnt mean they are good in science LOL,btohqsg
i remember him struggling in chem bonding,btohqsg
yeah and then i become irrelevant :(,btohqsg
By the end of the year he will be teaching you,btohqsg
Pass on your legacy to him,btohqsg
i will teach him molecular orbital theory!!!,btohqsg
He will be teaching you plank’s equation and schroedinger’s law,btohqsg
- -jay why u switch to chem from cs,btohqsg
tbh for the easy cap maintenance,btohqsg
i wanted to do both chem and cs anyway,btohqsg
figured that if i stay in cs and i cant maintain a high cap I cant 2nd major chem,btohqsg
tbh i wanted that  but not rly aiming for that anymore,btohqsg
chem and 2nd maj in cs?,btohqsg
There are courses you can’t go to?,btohqsg
its not even offered locally to begin with,btohqsg
comp chem is a very niche area anyway,btohqsg
comp bio and physics quite pop,btohqsg
Comp Chem to me sounds like C + quantum chem,btohqsg
idw to provide unnecessary stress either anyway,btohqsg
the parent was also scared when I taught him mole concept the start of this month,btohqsg
HAHA but dont lie to yourself becoming irrelevant is your no.1 concern HAHA,btohqsg
so i decided to piss off  cos i hate physics,btohqsg
i exhausted 105% of my resources,btohqsg
eh chem bonding also quantum lvel no,btohqsg
seems more chem than phy to me,btohqsg
oh no soon is gonna see this,btohqsg
He has disowned his schoolmates already,btohqsg
depends on how u even reacted to the lesson tbh,btohqsg
I thought Bedok viewian was Bedok viewian,btohqsg
