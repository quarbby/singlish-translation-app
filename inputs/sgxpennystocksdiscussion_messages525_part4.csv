fyi  i think FY will have huge dividend for uni-asia.. they stated before their dividend policy is to give 35% to 40% of profits as dividend. HY they made 12.5 cents SGD but paid only 2 cents SGD as dividend,btohqsg
by right  if 35% to 40% payout ratio  if make 12.5 cents SGD should be giving 4.5 cents to 5 cents.... but they only paid 2 cents SGD.,btohqsg
the balance of 2.5 cents to 3 cents to be paid for FY?,btohqsg
