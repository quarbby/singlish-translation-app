And is it true history is a subject you donâ€™t need to study for,btohqsg
Some studying is inevitable for history,btohqsg
But the way you study can be fun:),btohqsg
Need a good mix of Understanding of content + practicing papers.,btohqsg
She â€˜s not wrong.. sometimes studying does seem fun.,btohqsg
I type notes on MS Words and refer from there.,btohqsg
Yeah I agree esp after going through O levels and A levels  I enjoy studying Humanities.,btohqsg
idk it differs from ppl to ppl  but for me my way of memorisation is to write things out  so i basically went through both geog textbooks and summarised everything lmao,btohqsg
I studied pure History and H2 history,btohqsg
bio made way more sense to me so idk it was just remembering keywords and stringing them together,btohqsg
About Raffles etc. SEA history is more relatable.,btohqsg
Decolonization and colonisation of states  colonialism and imperialism is intriguing!,btohqsg
It is also fascinating to know that Hitler â€˜s not from Germany and Napoleon â€˜s not from France either.,btohqsg
yeboi i only studied ww2 and it didn't come out,btohqsg
I read ab it tho I'm not there yet,btohqsg

i sucked at writing the essays anyway,btohqsg
Is it cuz full of talking? I only know during the Cold War. They shot down two pax aircraft.,btohqsg
I go into ss exam without knowing anything,btohqsg

Haha what a mood. I have studied the cold war from sec school to JC ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
just memorise and write can liao,btohqsg
Ss study the whole textbook for 8 marks,btohqsg
To do well in History  u need to be good at both essay writing and SBQ,btohqsg
SBQ is often a differentiator btw a A/B student and the rest,btohqsg
I'm majoring in History now. So I can say this is really important!,btohqsg
WVEN THO I CRY OVER IT,btohqsg
Hahaha. I like both SS and History equally,btohqsg
I think the only reason I enjoy ss is like my Cher makes it entertaining,btohqsg
Yeah Teachers do make a big difference to one's interest in the subject,btohqsg
To make boring subjects interesting is a skill.,btohqsg
My lecturer make our module interesting too.. Although he curse at it sometimes.,btohqsg
Iâ€™m just gon pray that he ainâ€™t in this group I think Iâ€™ll die,btohqsg
Not all of them will use Tele. Do they?,btohqsg

My prof do. There is even a Telegram group for my module.,btohqsg
Mine have both Tele and WhatsApp. But Tele is quite dead.,btohqsg
Hahaha mine is also pretty dead except when it is nearer to assignment deadlines,btohqsg
Mine only used like initially. Now is like forgotten.,btohqsg
Like those looking for access to books and sources for essay writing,btohqsg
The rest of the days is pretty dead,btohqsg
Although my lecturer like to create WhatsApp stickers,btohqsg
