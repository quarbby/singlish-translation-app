4x try still nvr get :(,btohqsg
Good luck with the next one bro,btohqsg
Took me 4 tries to get my #,btohqsg
In the same boat. So much for MCPS too  doesn't seem to help,btohqsg
Oh no  mine was unsuccessful. Anyone can help to explain regarding open booking? I saw it stated mid march. How‚Äôs the procedure like?,btohqsg
Haven't actually tried it before cos the last time I looked  there were no 4 room units (can't recall if there were any 3 room ones),btohqsg
But from what I understand  it means that in mid march they will release the leftover flats. 1 week for you to look at what's available  before it's open for first come first serve booking.,btohqsg
^ this is based off my memory so take it with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
I see  thank u so much for ur explanation,btohqsg
I did that last Open Booking exercise. IMO its not worth it. Because its legit first come first serve basis to get q number for flat selection.We booked like 7 mins from the moment it released  and our q number was alr in the thousands.By the time my partner and I went to HDB to select flat  only the flexis were left  so we felt like it was a wasted trip üòÖ,btohqsg
But if you still wouldnt mind trying then honestly no harm bah  just felt kinda shitty to go HDB select flat and get nothing hahaha.,btohqsg
Wah! Alr in thousands?! How many room flat did you apply for?,btohqsg
funny thing is  the Open Booking project we applied for ended up having ONE 4rm unit up for SBF in Nov  so irritating üòÇ,btohqsg
oh well üòÇ leech off our parents it shall be! ü§≠,btohqsg
This  must be Yishun right. Hahaa. I tried that too but didnt get. üôà And yes  you need to have fast fingers to apply for Open Booking.But no harm trying sis.. maybe theres rizq for you  heh@Audhah,btohqsg
true la  no harm trying. Nothing to lose  literally. Nothing üòÇ,btohqsg
Thank u so much sister and everyone else. Hopefully those who were rejected today  u will get better queue numbers for the next round. I shall wait for may sbf then,btohqsg
Did anyone apply for SBF for Kallang/Whampoa Towner Crest/Kempas Residence? :),btohqsg
Yes. but is for 2 room flexi,btohqsg
Yes  on the queue to select  3 room flat  but won‚Äôt know if by the time my queue the unit still available or not .. * cross finger!,btohqsg
Omg means we are not even guarantee a unit even if we get a queue number?,btohqsg
bro  you need to solve what is 7+6,btohqsg
Anyone knows if Senja Valley  Senja Ridges and Senja Heights can be visited?,btohqsg
I've also asked but think there is no such group. Fellow Westscape owner here,btohqsg
When will be the next SBF?,btohqsg
Usually if we find for a property agent for a resale flat  what is the percentage they will take as a commission?,btohqsg
So buyer 1% and seller 2%?,btohqsg
Yes correct that's the market practice,btohqsg
Checked w HDB before. It takes place Twice a year. May and November,btohqsg
I tot only kitchen service yard and toilet comes w tiles?,btohqsg
Oic. When I select the unit it doesn‚Äôt come with the option. Maybe cos it‚Äôs sale of balance,btohqsg
Yes thats the market rate but its still negotiable.,btohqsg
Thank you guys for the info on sbf and property agent,btohqsg
