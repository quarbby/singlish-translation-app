Eh some profs never even change their exam paper year by year lol,btohqsg
omg i saw someone i know have to resit the paper,btohqsg
isnt nursing -> med easier than bcme -> med,btohqsg
assuming gpa 4.0 and 90rp respectively,btohqsg
but gpa 4.0 harder than 90rp i think,btohqsg
cos a lot of grp work,btohqsg
i wld say for me   getting 4.0 gpa is damn hard considering you have to maintain your score for like solid 3 years,btohqsg
like jc yk if you suck at one exam its fine but ur poly u suck one exam  gg can drop alr,btohqsg
is math must to go Med,btohqsg
Yea it‚Äôs not easy. In uni my friends said like if you got 4.9/5 you damn smart  5/5 means lucky,btohqsg
there‚Äôs a little truth to it,btohqsg
is there really a point in going beyond 4.5 anyway? Because you still graduate with the same class honours,btohqsg
mainly if you want to do further studies,btohqsg
if i email a company for a job how long will they usually take to reply,btohqsg
Do 90rp students tend to get 4plus goa,btohqsg
depends on the company lol. i've gotten anything from a day to never reply,btohqsg
also 16 yr old can volunteer for most things right...?,btohqsg
i would say usually yes  because it kinda shows they alr know how to study,btohqsg
but i've seen some crash and burn,btohqsg
uni just a different ball game la,btohqsg
Hi this is a weird question  but i had a family member lose data on his laptop and now apparrntly to get it back he has to pay a $100. Its a scam right,btohqsg
If he didnt go to the manufacturer company,btohqsg
depends honestly some can be recovered,btohqsg
not sure but $100 seems rather steep for such a thing doesnt it?,btohqsg
they wanted the money through paypal i think,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt give in cuz they might not even rt the data bck to the person.,btohqsg
Ok thks i searched for these scams online but cant seem to find one like this so i asked,btohqsg
it's hard to tell whether it's a scam without all the context,btohqsg
some data recovery can be quite ex  but it's never a guaranteed recovery,btohqsg
for more serious ones  a few hundred is not out of the question  but the sus part is specifically wanting it through paypal,btohqsg
but I don't personally know him LOL,btohqsg
How do you find his ig acc,btohqsg
i‚Äôd be shocked if he wasnt‚Ä¶,btohqsg
How does having 220 comments link to being,btohqsg
ppl with crap ton of followers and social media attention usually a bit uh,btohqsg
either super nice or super problematic,btohqsg
nowadays all xmm xdd have some 200 comments in their comment section,btohqsg
how come sudd got following and whatnot,btohqsg
