Talk so muchTmr gap up runAll self slap,btohqsg
Next week pick. Geo and JT. Superb result coming,btohqsg
Tmr Intl Cement what price ?,btohqsg
No expectation liao.. See result first..,btohqsg
Icg 1h and 2h at least still net profit earnings.. Not so bad still..,btohqsg
Hai.. Actually I see up abit but I need to say opposite.. Superstitious... Covid cases actually declining around the world.. Seem like vaccine quite effective as of now.. Generally it's good for the market sentiment,btohqsg
My speculation... probably isdn subsidiary/ies din perform well n drag the entire group down...,btohqsg
Didn't follow isdn.. But I am shadow follower,btohqsg
Think so ba...those stuck at high 70cents mostly yum gong liao,btohqsg
In the long run... isdn still can keep la... but dunno how long...lol... probably high opportunity costs,btohqsg
Can meh lol.. Not a fan.. Didn't follow isdn.. Will punt on tourism counter instead...,btohqsg
Hotel reits... Will try to Camp early ...dividend chor,btohqsg
Australia covid also less than 10 daily,btohqsg
Quite OK too.. They still make profit.. Don't know how they manage.. Good skill,btohqsg
Isdn say profit attributable to owners is 80% increase. So 7mil x1.8 is 12.6mil.Net profit projected by cimb is 22m includes net profit from non-controlling shareholder.So u should take whole net profit is 2019 = 14 m x 1.8 is already 25mSo is above cimb speculation. So expect gap up.,btohqsg
Huat ahGo see analyst 2019 figure in net profit and the full year statement to knowShareholders portion or everything,btohqsg
Ya. I check liao. Cimb say 22 mil is net profit. Which includes controlling and non-controllinh,btohqsg
Post covid counter sure can buy.. U got holding power a not? If don't hv u will lose opportunity cost lor,btohqsg
Mmm my sats i sold close to recent high,btohqsg
And made a lot money le,btohqsg
U most shiok lor.. Then enter at low again.. Every trader dream,btohqsg
Made $ from sats asking those who never made,btohqsg
Cos desmond said buy recovery play,btohqsg
Is not. CIMB 2019 net proft is attributable to shareholders only  so apples to apples  so 2020 forecast must be same apples. In addition  the 2020 forecast is $0.05 eps  how to get $0.05 eps if $21m profit includes non controlling interest,btohqsg
