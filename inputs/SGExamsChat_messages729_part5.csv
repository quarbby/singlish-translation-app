U are entitled to give NUS 15 dollars to laugh at you,btohqsg
Idk I don't pay much attention to the cost tbf it's negligible imo,btohqsg
Then again ah all S in Alevels nets you a 22.5RP... I don't even think poly will accept that,btohqsg
at that point you're better off using your O level score to enter poly lmao,btohqsg
dont even use your A level score to enter poly with all S,btohqsg
RP If u get like 40RP just use your alevels cuz 2.5 or 2 year course instead of 3,btohqsg
U don't need to do all the fluff bs general mods,btohqsg
40 rp should be very attainable  PW is already at minimum B or A,btohqsg
oh wait the new syllabus pw is p/f,btohqsg
Yeah exactly just get at least an E in 2 of your H2 subjects,btohqsg
And an E in your GP,btohqsg
Either ways is S really pulls down your average so u can guess what my RP would have to be and my other subjects to pull up that S,btohqsg
seeing that you've made it to NTU,btohqsg
your other subjects mustve been minimum Bs,btohqsg
or average Bs  probably one or two As?,btohqsg
pretty damn impressive for self study',btohqsg
I know MI is weird cuz I took MOB and had to steal notes from an MI kid,btohqsg
commerce stream is just weird as a whole,btohqsg
It's easy to score if u can just talk bs tho,btohqsg
its not difficult if you have the drive to do so,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoorwhen applying to NP did you use a level results or o levels btw,btohqsg
but to me who has wasted an entire saturday doing nothing when i wanted to do something  yeah its pretty hard,btohqsg
It was just tiring for me cuz I did it concurrently,btohqsg
But yeah it's possible if u eat snake in NS,btohqsg
looking back  yeah anyone could but the motivation was hard to find when i was at that stage,btohqsg
Yeah it's a lonely journey ngl,btohqsg
not easy when i had friends who rather play than study tbh,btohqsg
but that says more about me losing to that peer pressure i guess,btohqsg
it's motivation and also kinda knowing how to self study,btohqsg
i was even playing csgo during the midst of As so,btohqsg
Na it's also the psychological trauma of being left out,btohqsg
both of which i still do not grasp,btohqsg
a lot of people have trouble initially in uni partly bc of the structure they're used to from jc and earlier,btohqsg
Ya but he say like 40+rp can use it for poly,btohqsg
So that’s why I want to know which you used to apply,btohqsg
I don't even how what am I doing even now tbh I just react based on what I have.,btohqsg
getting spawned killed the moment you come out because you dont know the spawn peeks spots,btohqsg
yeah i've been reacting for the past 3 sems,btohqsg
i think i still slack alot gg,btohqsg
its not that it isnt going decently well for me  but i think i can do better than decent,btohqsg
Oh ok  there isn’t much info I can find online about applying using a level results,btohqsg
Just wanna find out how it works,btohqsg
And how they decide which modules you can skip,btohqsg
The H2 requirements are strict tho if u fuck up on H2s u gone,btohqsg
Still haven’t decided but if I do may be next year and not this,btohqsg
Idk if I got enough time study,btohqsg
I left and now apparently I still qualify for a part time diploma if I want,btohqsg
Plus right if I get rejected I might have to retake my h1 content so that’s more important,btohqsg
For like 2 years with a lower load and for like 2k,btohqsg
If I get A will pull up my rp by 2.5,btohqsg
