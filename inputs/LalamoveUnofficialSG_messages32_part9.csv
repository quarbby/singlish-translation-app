i looked up whyq and pickupp. cant find how much they pay. they reveal their rider rates only after sign up?,btohqsg
I can show u the price,btohqsg
WhyQ base $8.50  $4.50 per drop  $0.30/km  20 mins waiting + $2. Commission is 10%. This was what they told us when I joined last yr lah.After doing for a few months  I realised WhyQ if kena multidrop  more worth than llm  BUT llm sometimes got the LLM subsidy thing. So in conclusion  both end up about the same.Only real advantage with taking whyq order on their app is you get to see the job first. After 15min if no WhyQ rider take they push to LLM.,btohqsg
Hope this helps anyone looking at WhyQ,btohqsg
Thx Khai! whyq pay is surprisingly competitive.,btohqsg
Officially I dunno bro but I got see some people do,btohqsg
Work as long n when u can or fix time period like food panda? Thanks,btohqsg
Like when you want lor. But whyq jobs only available during lunch and dinner. They operate from hawker centres,btohqsg
Food panda is more petrol/diesel friendly.,btohqsg
panda dont use as much petrol coz distances much shorter... but the frequent start-stop actually really bad for engine.,btohqsg

During CB I tried lalamove with car,btohqsg

I got a job everymorning 530am pick up 50 bento boxes from taiseng send to holland & bukit timah. $40 daily.. is it too low,btohqsg
I think u get it wrong. The job doesn't earn 140. Is because of purchase services. He pay for the item first then customer paylah him the delivery fee and the purchase item together,btohqsg
So this job how much should i charge   anybody can advise market price,btohqsg
Should charge at least 50 to 60,btohqsg
Buy item $114 she pay me plus dilivery $27 total $140,btohqsg
