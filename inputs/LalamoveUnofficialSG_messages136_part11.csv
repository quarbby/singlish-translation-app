Donâ€™t need to change. As long as your boot space big  can stack. But stack reasonably. Later no reason kena complain. ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
The commission for van without sticker rabak sia,btohqsg
If u wan to do van u need to know which order can do and which cannot do. And your cancellation rate will be fucking high due to those ppl who misuse the app. Such as washing machine with no helper $$ added  and all kind of rubbish.,btohqsg
Even u get those van job with high price also dun be too happy.,btohqsg
They will tell u that I had a 2.4mtr sofa with no manpower added and no one to assist in moving,btohqsg
I had been a 2.4 driver for many yrs....last time the price is good and alot of order and less driver. And user will add on money if u are reasonable. Now diff .less order and many driver. And all the driver are bangala!! And because of them willing to do this shit price that's why lalamove keep on lowing down the price!! And user know if u dun do shit things at shit price other will do ! And now the stupid quality bar is the worst things! All kind of cancellation will drop the bar. Once the bar if empty 3 times . Good luck. Will cus permanently banned from lalla,btohqsg
