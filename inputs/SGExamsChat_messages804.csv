And then I get to steal the copper wires from the old campus,btohqsg
Even that is abit too pitiful,btohqsg
Given this I don’t know why moe doesn’t want to give the same treatment for YI. Should’ve kept them at the IJC site and rebuilt the YJC site then when it’s done move yi to Yishun,btohqsg
Got 50$ budget for each prize,btohqsg
apparently one of my family friend lives there,btohqsg
I still have my original SG50 lego seal in box somewhere,btohqsg
At least they won’t have to reinstall them this time  only the demolition company loses out,btohqsg
its bigger than a 3 bed if i remember correctly,btohqsg
that whole plot of forest borders both side of rp,btohqsg
The demo company can still get the rebar in the concrete,btohqsg
He is one of those prof with china sounding name,btohqsg
Sajc and acjc together will be a sht storm,btohqsg
It probably would have to be IPJCs alr  unless the govt can somehow convince govt aided JCs to merge,btohqsg
Ask him to nepo u there,btohqsg
Ask him for a job la,btohqsg
MI and RI  bring together the Is,btohqsg
I'm the black sheep of the family 😊😊,btohqsg
Merging ip jc will cause a lot of mafan,btohqsg
One in bishan  thhe other in bukit batok please lah,btohqsg
U tryna increase or decrease our birthrate,btohqsg
And refurbishing a sch shouldn’t even take long,btohqsg
Cause usually Ip schools are schools that alr have established sch spirit and identity,btohqsg
Just turn RI into Bishan North secondary school,btohqsg
Actually maybe ah then the smart kids can help the stupid ones,btohqsg
Yeah TPJC campus took one year to refurbish for TJ to move in,btohqsg
It’s just want or don’t want,btohqsg
Then move SAJC into CJC campus,btohqsg
tbf i can see why reagan said it cause of the land area,btohqsg
so i have concluded the ranking of polys all these while was based on the size of the schsp- 38 hectaresnp-33.6 hectaresnyp-30 hectarestp-30 hectaresrp-20 hectares,btohqsg
If they want  next year move to ijc also can,btohqsg
Unless you say for example like DHS and RVHS ip go to 1 jc (which is unrealistic cause two sch too far alr) then i think its still quite far fetch,btohqsg
There's something about it that allure that increases the rate,btohqsg
CJC is catholic  SA is anglican,btohqsg
Still smaller than the plot of land in Malaysia that my uncle owns,btohqsg
Because of the larger student population?,btohqsg
Rn they are doing refurbishment in yi campus for idk what reasons,btohqsg
Good what finally merged tgt this time by the same horniness that separate both religions,btohqsg
Like u gonna move out in 2-3 years time,btohqsg
Should merge rj ej and nyjc,btohqsg
Fkkk the vege restaurant is closing,btohqsg
Nyjc should become an ipjc  they can partner up with cchm,btohqsg
They are so close together anyway,btohqsg
Do have stuff at home kinfa,btohqsg
What if all sit campuses merged,btohqsg
Their new principal who wants to run it like hci would be delighted,btohqsg
One big appeal of NYJC is no IP so I heard alot of 6 pointer who dw IP jae divide choose NY,btohqsg
oh wait yea they alr merging,btohqsg
They should leave the ip jc alone,btohqsg
Last time merge so many jc for what,btohqsg
My brother is from there. He flexes on me. If his alma mater becomes bishan jc  no more flex,btohqsg
Then if now not enough jc,btohqsg
wait when they gon do sit merging,btohqsg
You should flex on him instead,btohqsg
im tryna go sit in future 😭,btohqsg
He is top of food chain,btohqsg
He from rjc (noob elitist)You ite dropout (choose own path free of societal norms),btohqsg
Or maybe nyjc should be offered the status of an independent school,btohqsg
What is there to merge when the best have been merged,btohqsg
i was abt to tell reagan that because ite used to have 7 campuses..and they merged them to form 3 main ones..so i wouldn't be surrpise if sit faced the same fate,btohqsg
Just like how hci and rjc got it in the 80s after Tony Tan introduced such a status,btohqsg
Humans are top of food chain also but one ebola virus infection and its gojoever,btohqsg
I actually like the sound of this,btohqsg
Many times I submit then the system never register lmao,btohqsg
talking bout that i got my intern shit to do,btohqsg
U cannot do last minute submission,btohqsg
rp system is too trash for that,btohqsg
I submit 7pm and got confirmation,btohqsg
But the system crash and they reset soon after,btohqsg
ny whole rj was submitted blabj,btohqsg
This plot of land used to house a ite campus,btohqsg
Next day I got noticed by my faci to get fucked,btohqsg
I blamed LEO and submitted immediately again,btohqsg
mine told me 2 weeks later,btohqsg
Got once LEO crashed when we just about to do PQ at 3pm,btohqsg
End up the faci rushed like shit up to print it out,btohqsg
oh yea any of you kenna the kahoot graded anot,btohqsg
apparently rp now uses kahoot as graded quizes,btohqsg
Depends sometimes it's like a close book quiz sometimes it's just the group worksheet given during Phase 1,btohqsg
i swear i said this exact thing like last yr,btohqsg
Depends on school mine used kahoot but only for the COL and SDL marks,btohqsg
they alr started using it in sem 1 yr 1,btohqsg
my juniors in both sas and soi kenna alr,btohqsg
Our batch was consulted on that lmao,btohqsg
but i really wonder how they grade...the bloody person that gives majority of the mark literally came once,btohqsg
its a 6/4 ratio with my rp supervisor and my company supervisor,btohqsg
Btw anyone know what drink matcha like,btohqsg
"why tf rp supervisor grade 60%...I literally tried to show her what i did  she was like ""aiya dont need  i dont know what you doing anyways""",btohqsg
Deleting message soon so someone pls know,btohqsg

I think ill get slapped on the spot,btohqsg
Btw she got dragged into smt troublesome so yeah,btohqsg
The best drink is the drink u get for free,btohqsg
i have a friend that like to order mango sago with red beans,btohqsg
Seems like I was not alone in flagging this war crime of a drink,btohqsg
If i drink and its bad how,btohqsg
oh then thats ur tastebuds' problem,btohqsg
U know how drinks now have A-D levels,btohqsg
the person behind the counter commited a crime,btohqsg
I am pretty sure that drink is off the charts,btohqsg
ngl those letters dont do shit for me,btohqsg
every other day i drink the pokka with D,btohqsg
Koi itself is sweet liao + Ribena a D drink,btohqsg
i dont see their ads but i still drink,btohqsg
but A is good is it,btohqsg
if you get a C or D  you cant advertise your drink,btohqsg
D means they cannot advertise at all BAD,btohqsg
thats why all them pokka ads are gone,btohqsg
all them yakult ads are also gone,btohqsg
except yakult gold which is shit,btohqsg
its just yougurt drink at the end of the day,btohqsg
I just buy the cheapest one,btohqsg
"my friend been complaining how the coke he now drinks from alot of fast food restauraunts are of the ""zero"" variant",btohqsg
Rn should be the China C thing,btohqsg
and those cokes legit taste like plastic,btohqsg
No it's the less sugar variety. I can taste the difference,btohqsg
Ill be real i dont like nutri grade,btohqsg
oh but yea he dont like the taste,btohqsg
wth is the aftertaste...i still can tarhan their chocolate,btohqsg
but damn...the base one legit putrid,btohqsg
the after taste is good tho,btohqsg
To get back that kick a 25 75 mixture of redbull and coke actually is pretty good,btohqsg
Will give u diabetes if u drink it like coke,btohqsg
maybe is my tastebuds..but i cant stand the base one with no flavouring,btohqsg
i like strawberry or banana  but ngl meji is nicer,btohqsg
Then again i have the weirdest tastebuds that can tolerate a lot of bs,btohqsg
the normal one? it  taste like puke,btohqsg
blue cheese is no go for me,btohqsg
THAT literally it the aftertaste holy cannot sia,btohqsg
the flavoured HL's at least drown out the aftertaste,btohqsg
i wonder what cow it come from,btohqsg
Wait is hl milk still the same from 2010 period,btohqsg
They add stabilisers that's where the taste comes from lmao,btohqsg
idt HL milk is real milk,btohqsg
Hl milk isnt legit legit milk ah js sayin,btohqsg
that was bbt orders not my favourite drink...,btohqsg
oh...wiat now that i think about it,btohqsg
O my bad then ill not get that then,btohqsg

I tried that with a pregnant woman once. Bad idea.,btohqsg
Later matcha see me and see a fat fk and run away from the event LOL,btohqsg
The more i grew up the more i realised how much diff drink flavours i never got to try,btohqsg
then when i go and source them...they are barely seen,btohqsg
Milk is milk she never specify the source.,btohqsg
i still remember the old packaging,btohqsg
im pretty sure the lower blood chloestrol ones taste exactly the same as the normal ones  js that they add or remove stuff inside,btohqsg
There's this iconic banana milk in Korea that I drank non stop,btohqsg
It was an artificial banana but damn it was good,btohqsg

Sugary drinks are a scam. It's just water and corn syrup with artificial flavoring,btohqsg
this y we all get diabetes,btohqsg
At least we still young haha,btohqsg
Diabetes is a older ppl disease,btohqsg

am eyelash was on my eye,btohqsg
Uhhh but its type 1 diabetes,btohqsg
Like it fell out and is floating arnd on my eye,btohqsg
That one may not be due to lifestyle,btohqsg
There is type 1 and type 2 diabetes,btohqsg
idk what the fk u talking bout,btohqsg
whats the diff wanna tell me?,btohqsg
i think u go google better,btohqsg
Type 1 diabetes is when ur immune system attacks the pancreatic cells,btohqsg
i kena eye infection last year,btohqsg
Type 2 diabetes is due to insulin resistance,btohqsg
Type 2 is more likely to be due to lifestyle issues,btohqsg
since u say untill so confindentally,btohqsg
Tbh type 3 is not talked abt a lot,btohqsg
most wont know unless u in healthcare,btohqsg
Alzheimers and diabetes got link meh,btohqsg
type 4 is uh apprantly this,btohqsg
Its a proposed idea that insulin resistant in brain lead to Alzheimer's or smt,btohqsg
Ppl toes get chopped off bcos of diabetes,btohqsg
a widely known link to type 2 diabetes,btohqsg
And individuals with abdominal obesity do not fall under the obesity categorisation,btohqsg
Apparently there is a new miracle drug for diabetes,btohqsg
Which also helps ppl lose weight,btohqsg
Strangely we haven't heard much of it here in sg,btohqsg
Ppl I know who have diabetes here,btohqsg
They still using old fashioned insulin,btohqsg
Zack bro u actually can do shit so like bro trust urself more dont pity urself like actually,btohqsg

And dont say sht that is factually inaccurate in 1 google search,btohqsg
At least he never dm and apologize like ryan,btohqsg
Or like js dont make statements,btohqsg
Nighttime question: is it just me  or do practically no Singaporeans have a growler-type voice?,btohqsg
I can growl if you like,btohqsg
U can trash talk back yk,btohqsg
Picture Solid Snake's voice from the Metal Gear series or Kiefer Sutherland's voice. It's like a low  husky rasp-ey type voice,btohqsg
I've been done with that life long ago  what's the point. End up make everybody more mad and rile up emotions.If your goal is to make me mad to the point I'll cross the line and get banned kicked. That will legit never happened  in the last few years I have not even directed a single cursed word to anybody here nor capitalized any single word at anyone.You can say I'm dead inside whatever  it's your opinion etc. but I am legit done with getting mad at anybody,btohqsg
nah futureofryan got his redemption arc,btohqsg
think a sge unwritten rule is,btohqsg
there must be at least 1 downie active in the chat at any one time,btohqsg
when one stops being a downie another will take their place,btohqsg
got the j1 girl that says im trash i cant do math x100,btohqsg
Shhhhh dont leak my ntu supplier,btohqsg
maybe u can ask the palestine supporters in ntu what theyre smoking,btohqsg
mfs r high as fuck on their on copium,btohqsg
They will say it's from Isreal and to boycott it,btohqsg
uno reverse ur meth comes from israel,btohqsg
Lanpa I just wanna eat my McDongDong in peace,btohqsg
boycott starbucks!!!! (boycott ends when got 1 for 1),btohqsg
bruh recently ive been bombing so much on starbies,btohqsg
the more i see those boycott starbucks posts,btohqsg
Did u see the fucking joke of this article whereby some singapore idiot rejected Harvard for NUS cuz of the protests,btohqsg
palestine supporters are scary as fuck,btohqsg
id kill one if i could get away with it,btohqsg
they have to realise that palestine was never about the kids or the humanity or whatever,btohqsg
its all the leftist concepts rolled into one single “issue” + antisemitism,btohqsg
Honestly haven't we learnt our lesson to just leave the middle east alone.,btohqsg
decolonisation white privilege antisemitism terrorism acceptance environmental terrorism patriachy,btohqsg
i saw those palestine supporters read and agree with bin laden’s letter to america,btohqsg
wtf has the world gone to..,btohqsg
most of these ppl cant even say which river and which sea,btohqsg
There was outrage with the current Taliban justice system too they where like oh there's no due process,btohqsg
wait why am i using my actual tele to say this,btohqsg
they dont realise what would happen if a palestinian was in front of them rn,btohqsg
your average level 1 malnourished palestinian,btohqsg
why the feminists and LGBTQ+ not fighting against palestine,btohqsg
Starbucks is too expensive and idl coffee,btohqsg
But if someone is willing to get me a matcha latte from starbucks idm,btohqsg
tbh even w/o the protest and situation its kind of understandable cause tbh us isnt the safest for asian americans due to the racism ... I personally wouldnt want to go to the us for studies due to many reasons,btohqsg
If u had the means why df not lmao why limit yourself to the Singapore experience,btohqsg
If have to go overseas I rather go uk,btohqsg
The story I mentioned had her go NUS not even any other Overseas Uni.,btohqsg
Also the UK has its own basket of issues that makes even that decision questionable in comparison to an Ivy,btohqsg
Yeah also idk why she comparing UK and US unis in isolation.. both have very different admissions systems and u cannot rlly optimise for both thus having an offer from an Ivy + Oxbridge/LSE concurrently is kinda unrealistic as well,btohqsg
Im not sure if my parents are serious about me working overseas (aka migrate)…sekali i go and they abandon me,btohqsg
But i just checked that to be a pharmacist in Australia  i need to be registered here first,btohqsg
A lot of parents mine included just throw their kid into the deep end for a sink or swim kinda thing,btohqsg
For Japan  it isnt a die requirement but need pay 20000 to 50000 JPY for degree verification to Japan Pharmaceutical Association  and can take up to 6m,btohqsg
For me it is coz pharmacists in Australia do hv a better life (not sure about the burden sort of but they hv more power + pay),btohqsg
And they are really in demand,btohqsg
U never factor in a change in living and the cost of living in that tho,btohqsg
It's always a challenge adapting to a country when migrating,btohqsg
Actually the first thought my dad has abt moving to Australia is coz their care for special needs is much btr than SG,btohqsg
Here charge $300 a month for SPEDs school💀💀,btohqsg
If worse case get posted to day care  so that figure fee,btohqsg
Yea this also and after covid  angmos - Asian conflict there,btohqsg
Either ways u need at least some backup should all else fails imo if u wanna migrate,btohqsg
But i think jpn i prolly cmi coz need pass Japan Proficiency Test N1/2,btohqsg
SG is a boring place to live in,btohqsg
Have at least a 6 months buffer in cash reserves and obv don't burn all the bridges that allows you to retreat to sg just in case,btohqsg
The relying on parents part is part of that equation either as last resort bridge or just the cash buffer.,btohqsg
I just need more assurance fr my parents first that they are just not saying for the sake of it / abandon me after i go,btohqsg
Depends on the sliver or stainless steel spoon u grow up with,btohqsg
cb i read that as insurance,btohqsg
Then only migrate once u have a 6 month cash buffer lor,btohqsg
But my dad told me i need to go first coz i hv the highest chance of obtaining australia pr,btohqsg
Make your own assurance if your parents cannot guarantee,btohqsg
Then can help the whole fam get pr,btohqsg
I cant make my own assurance…what if my family stay in sg and abandon me overseas  i also dw that,btohqsg
Coz to me family is still a first,btohqsg
U very funny ah I wan u to think this again.,btohqsg
So if you parents don't give you assurance of backing why should u give assurance of backing and reciprocate that u will help em with PR,btohqsg
No his point is that i need to go first then the rest hv chance of obtaining pr too,btohqsg
If they don't give you the tools to make it work and u make the tools yourself why should they get the rewards of the final product,btohqsg
Yala and to go first u need assurance,btohqsg
bc it is q hard to obtain pr overseas is hard  u really need to be an asset to that country,btohqsg
To be an asset u need to build up to actually become an asset,btohqsg
Neh idw to risk my life,btohqsg
This whole thing will be all settled if i actually study my pharmacy degree in australia,btohqsg
I think it was really a plan then coz my dad actually called the university to ask some questions etc,btohqsg
No only australia and jpn in my mind🤣,btohqsg
But then also I prioritised family,btohqsg
Like literally the only thing between me n doing degree overseas,btohqsg
Id rather go to uk because uk admission system places more emphasis on academics and stuff thats actually relevant to what you want to study,btohqsg
Tel Aviv university is not bad if you want to work in the security sector,btohqsg
Imagine a Chinese official visit the us,btohqsg
Yeah I saw somewhere that their criminology courses are best in the world,btohqsg
Then go to the UK la but how is that germane to the US system of holistic admissions? There are ppl who benefit and prefer that too,btohqsg
I swear I saw a docu on a sg student being in that uni,btohqsg
Usa  Russia  the name of two rural localities,btohqsg
Most famous one I bet you,btohqsg
Nah but it's something else to name a military installation,btohqsg
Chinese military officer: We got a aircraft flying overheadChinese military official: Where did it come fromChinese military officer: China Lake  sir!Chinese military official: What?,btohqsg
Town recently got famous for a mass stabbing,btohqsg
maybe USA is obsessed with something?,btohqsg
If china and the US has a baby what would they call it 🤔,btohqsg
surely someone paid the Woman lol.,btohqsg
mass stabbing / mass shooting. alot of sick people in the US. lol,btohqsg
is js chinese food but more daring,btohqsg
I messed up the ratios on making tom yum and ended up with chinese food,btohqsg
u want make tom yum soup,btohqsg
Seafood tom yum devolved into chinese fish soup,btohqsg
yeah too much condensed milk haha,btohqsg
I messed up ratio of the chilli and tomato,btohqsg
Woah Jensen Huang positive media reporting,btohqsg
hopefully he doesn’t buy a social media site,btohqsg
Talking about Nvidia  did you buy and hold in the end,btohqsg
I feel so stupid for selling off,btohqsg
I wonder if smci is a better buy than Nvidia now,btohqsg
I can’t do options trading yet,btohqsg
I also rather just buy instead of short,btohqsg
What stocks do you currently have in your portfolio if you don’t mind saying? I sold everything I had so I’m contemplating whether to re enter now or just wait for the next bear market,btohqsg
Oh  I'm a pretty boring investor. I basically sell puts on indexes and indefinitely hold whatever I happen to take assignment on.,btohqsg
Which means I'm essentially all-in on VOO,btohqsg
I have a smaller account to experiment with more interesting stuff  but that's a work in progress.,btohqsg
Tbh I still haven’t fully understood how options trading works,btohqsg
Have you made a lot so far,btohqsg
Well  begin by understanding what puts and calls are. Then read up on options strategies.,btohqsg
It's impossible because by definition you can't beat the market investing in VOO haha,btohqsg
Donating my money to wallstreet. I am funding the wine collection of some hedge fund owner.,btohqsg
and im donating 0.001% of his jacob and co godfather watch,btohqsg
never knew Malaysians can become Singaporean cops. lol.,btohqsg
Me before entering the stock market: Buy low and sell high? How hard can it possibly be?,btohqsg
Me after entering the stock market:,btohqsg
starbies is a great undervalued stock rn,btohqsg
havent been tracking it but last i checked,btohqsg
I see u found the WSB special,btohqsg
cuz of the palestine idiots the share price beared,btohqsg
but its a fundamentally great company,btohqsg
I wanted to buy but then I thought it would dip more  now it rose again :(,btohqsg
im looking for nvda entry point,btohqsg
should have bought lockheed martin before the wars bruhhhh,btohqsg
Feels good to give back to the community,btohqsg
It dropped from 88 to 72 and now rose back to 82 lol,btohqsg
I bought credit suisse in 2022,btohqsg
I hope the analysts are right about a summer correction so there’s a good entry point,btohqsg
I feel like I still won’t buy it now but if it does dip further I would consider,btohqsg
Also I wonder how Palo Alto would do,btohqsg
No.. its under UBS now lmao,btohqsg
The stock which Pelosi bought 1 million in calls only for it to drop by more than 30% after lol  so maybe by the end of the year it’ll be back,btohqsg
When I searched credit suites I got this,btohqsg
At like 10 cents on the dollar yes.,btohqsg
Oh they bond holders got wiped out,btohqsg
I mean I typed it in webull correctly,btohqsg
Then DHY appeared as the first search result,btohqsg
DHY is the insolvency rights for those,btohqsg
Haha manpower running low in sg,btohqsg
Right now I’m down around 280sgd,btohqsg
It was a shotgun marriage cuz CS was too big to fail,btohqsg
So trying to think of whether to just quit now,btohqsg
I lost double that from CS alone,btohqsg
So those numbers are rookie numbers,btohqsg
Actually I lost more but webull gave stock voucher and free stocks,btohqsg
CS shareholder got given UBS stock at 10 cents on the dollar,btohqsg
And we were given that only cuz the Saudi Government owned 20% of the stock,btohqsg
Would have been very awkward for the Swiss to not give some money back,btohqsg
Wait so that means for every 10 cents worth of CS they got a dollar worth of UBS?,btohqsg
technically speaking i got 29x roi at its peak,btohqsg
No UBS bought every CS stock for 10 cents on the dollar.,btohqsg
but ofc that ship has sailed,btohqsg
So for every dollar of assets they paid 10 cents,btohqsg
The Saab driver  42  involved in the fatal Tampines accident that killed 2 people has hired lawyers to represent him in court.He has 4 charges against him  including 2 for dangerous driving.➡️https://bit.ly/45byYMrFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
i think even jayoma shouldnt take his case,btohqsg
Funnily enough I am in the green for most of my bank stocks,btohqsg
GS is up the most for me,btohqsg
Prob going to get a reduced sentenced but won't be acquitted of all charges,btohqsg
That is how traffic related incidents result in court,btohqsg
There’s a button on the side that will bring you to the msg @,btohqsg
calling the chem cher bro be like 🤣,btohqsg
Nope  the deal was for CHF3 billion and was all in stock. That translates to CHF0.81 per share  which is 59% below the value of CS stock on the last trading day before the deal was made,btohqsg
She can enjoy life whilr we suffer,btohqsg
he called the pe cher bro also,btohqsg
CS shareholders would have gotten way less than 10 cents per dollar of assets  given CS total assets was around CHF 500B at the end of 2022,btohqsg
at least ur mid yr over what,btohqsg
Now  the net assets figure might be a different story,btohqsg
jc kids have to study through the june hols for mid year exams,btohqsg
thhat one i after prelims then do,btohqsg
U dumb shit the stock was already down like crazy and I ain't even talking about AUM just Current Assets,btohqsg
Yes I did I am a shareholder lmao,btohqsg
I am saying I got 10 cents on the dollar lmao,btohqsg
Yes  that's based on your cost basis lol,btohqsg
The price of CS already dropped like a rock,btohqsg
Yeah I lowered my cost basis and bought more,btohqsg
Then  it was further cut by 59% from price at last closing,btohqsg
But effectively I had 10 cents on the dollar in returns,btohqsg
You would have gotten more than 10 cents if you had sold on the market before the deal was announced,btohqsg
Ah yes sell before the shotgun marriage,btohqsg
The shotgun marriage that took 3 days and they decided over 1 weekend,btohqsg
If you are counting CS total assets  shareholders got less than 1 cent per dollar of total assets. Total  not net,btohqsg
But they screwed over AT1 holders even more,btohqsg
U haven't seen their bond holders,btohqsg
Technically that shouldnt have happened  shares should have been wiped out before bonds,btohqsg
It was the dictat of the swiss govt that wiped out at1,btohqsg
The Saudis own 20% of the shares.,btohqsg
The Swiss government would have a fun time explaining that so they didn't,btohqsg
They have some responsibility to share for the pr disaster that resulted in collapse,btohqsg
The saudi bank chief  that is,btohqsg
You don't just say on tv that you're not gonna invest any more in a bank that you invested a lot in,btohqsg
By that standard  a lot of Temasek would already be dead by now,btohqsg
We don't just rely on Temasek for SG,btohqsg
Temasek made a number of questionable investments,btohqsg
Temasek was made for the higher risk investments..,btohqsg
Of course  every investment fund will make terrible investments once in a while,btohqsg
You can't beat the one where they put 150m in a nigerian gas company that went broke,btohqsg
I don't think u seem to understand. SG layers it's holdings,btohqsg
Temasek is basically the government Venture Capital and hedge fund. High risk but high returns.,btohqsg
Of course. But the failures have entertainment value,btohqsg
Of course  one would expect a portion of high risk investments to fail,btohqsg
Now how did we get drawn into this conversation,btohqsg
Hodl  to the moon  diamond hands,btohqsg
eh btw gme gna bullrun again,btohqsg
Cuz Roaring Kitty posted his positions,btohqsg
not u replying to a message sent months ago💀💀💀,btohqsg
I wonder  when ppl get sucked dry in a bout of volatility  if hedge fund bros send them a ggwp message on their bloomberg terminal,btohqsg
idk enough about this to be placing beta,btohqsg
Probably to sell the IV yes,btohqsg
bruh u go back to sch first,btohqsg
Just deciding between iron condor or butterfly,btohqsg
Think I should go wider and do a butterfly,btohqsg
Nah  im gonna hodl my fractional share of nvda to the moon 💸💸💸🤡🤡🤡,btohqsg
i unfortunately was a target for FAs and their ILPs,btohqsg
Both are same just the price u sell is diff,btohqsg
which means im not the smartest in that sense,btohqsg
(i didnt buy bc i have amazing FA hating friends),btohqsg
Basically sell a put and buy a put but at a wider strike price.,btohqsg
i wouldnt say that out loud lest there are ite dropouts that aftually are good,btohqsg
He would be a great FA talk cock and tell me things I already experienced,btohqsg
great and FA cannot go in the same sentence,btohqsg
am a very intense fa hater,btohqsg
Gotta be retarded to make it,btohqsg
FA is useless  sell overpriced shit packaged as 'structured products',btohqsg
wow i agree with u for once,btohqsg
fas are the scum of society,btohqsg
Where do u think they make marni from,btohqsg
People dumber than me. Who buy a long term insurance product and end up surrendering for cents on the dollar,btohqsg
Yes let him do FA la legal scamming,btohqsg
U say u got no skills what go do FA they pay damn well and it worksbecauseu got no skills,btohqsg
Oh I didn't think I was talking to mother Theresa mf u wanna make money quick and fast but no skill wdf u expect.,btohqsg
Heh  I do remote coding jobs,btohqsg
Nice can hold for a bit longer  eventually it will fall again but don’t know when. Just make sure you take profits while it’s still green,btohqsg
Im gonna hold for a year,btohqsg
Your exit strategy just says YOLO,btohqsg
Sell a covered call at a price you're comfortable with and let them rip it out of your hands,btohqsg
Is the Swiss government really obligated to bail them out though? Even if it’s unprecedented not like they ever said they can guarantee bondholders would be saved in the event the bank goes out of business,btohqsg
At what price did you buy it for,btohqsg
The Swiss government literally enacted a law to wipe them out,btohqsg
It certainly could be seen to violate bilateral investment treaties,btohqsg
Too big to fail either ways they did bail em out,btohqsg
Wiped out by legislative and executive fiat,btohqsg
Yeah should be fine  you can set a stop loss such that you can take profit in the event it suddenly crashes. Another way is to just hold even if it crashes but you add more and average down,btohqsg
Problem now. They solved too big to fail by making it even bigger. UBS is now larger in AUM and reserves than even the National Bank itself,btohqsg
