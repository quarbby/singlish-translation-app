SSB is for long term  unless can predict that bank interest will be keep > 3% for 10 years,btohqsg
I do think the interest environment have change. It will be more than 3% for 10 years.,btohqsg
i also have the same thinking  currently the rates given by ocbc and uob is averaging maybe around 4-5%. (not including the highest tier met)i think it will be a good run for the banks for awhile. but im open to opinions  i might not be thinking correctly,btohqsg
ssb can always withdrawn  so now i withdrawing some of my previous SSB that < 2.5% but keep some >3% for diversification. I think interest will reach some stable point around 3-4% this year,btohqsg
Most likely not - TnCsCannot do scan and go alsoHowever Lunar New Year is coming. When every week the bill is above 80ish sometimes 150 plus a week … 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
this is the dilemma lol  the numbers offered this time round is kinda in between...,btohqsg
After getting credit gift  how many months is safe enough to cancel  wait out and reapply?Any cheat sheet for banks? Eg  maybank  citibank  HSBC  cimb,btohqsg
same question  and i also wonder about dbs,btohqsg
Check the terms and conditions of the gift promo. Nowadays the most common is that you can't cancel for 12 mnths.,btohqsg
For e.g. if you go to MoneySmart now and just click the T&Cs for the citibank promo now  the pdf with the T&Cs does state the following:5. Customers cannot cancel their credit card within 12 months from card approval. If theydo so  they will not be eligible for the Gift. MoneySmart reserves the right to claw backthe Gift in such cases.,btohqsg
"And for re-application  the definition of ""Eligible New Customer"" will also be there:“Eligible New Customers” refers to applicants who meet the following conditions:...ii. has not previously canceled any Citibank Credit Cards in the last twelve (12)months immediately prior to his/her application for the Eligible Card and prior tothe commencement of the Application Period.",btohqsg
Does citi rewards card have minimum spend?,btohqsg
Anyone knows how uob tabulate the annual interest base on above?,btohqsg
Once it’s filled up to BHS  no longer have the opportunity to top up for tax deduction. See what’s your purpose of topping up,btohqsg
im not sure what that $200 cash rebate is  but otherwise u should refer to the detailed breakdown table  that shows interest rates in tranches of 30K  30K  15K and 25K (total of 100K),btohqsg
Too misleading to indicate $5002.50 as annual interest,btohqsg
but $5002.50 is correct if you maintain $100K and fulfil the 3 criteria. what's misleading about it....?,btohqsg
What's the cheapest way to withdraw my USD from my DBS,btohqsg
Or any fee less way to transfer from DBS to uob USD account,btohqsg
not really  just that points awarded for blocks of $1,btohqsg
Just open dbs multi currency account and transfer to uob multi currency acc. I assume is usd to usd,btohqsg
Ya  there's a fees for transfer,btohqsg
Just thought if have any way to avoid that,btohqsg
Not sure. I think about 5usd or 10 usd maybe. Intermediate bank fee. Just not confirm as it is both are Singapore bank,btohqsg
I meet all criteria but interest credit is not the stated amt,btohqsg
im not sure what numbers you are comparing with... the $5002.50 is the total annual interest. which means monthly you will get that amount divided by 12.You also need to make sure your monthly average balance is listed as >= $100K,btohqsg
U are right but still even per mth i am not getting the stated interest..,btohqsg
then you probably need to calculate and dispute with the bank if necessary. me and a few friends calculated ours and all of us had no problem 😅,btohqsg
So the cpf from work for Ma portion will flow to SA?,btohqsg
I always find uob one and it's card very convuluted. If you have no salary credit  the optimal amount for int is 75k not 100k.,btohqsg
isn't that quite normal for all the high interest accounts?,btohqsg
If the MA is at BHS  it will flow to SA. If SA also at FRS  should flow to OA,btohqsg
I dont know abt the rest. I have both Ocbc and uob. Ocbc is quite clear on the requirement. The credit card is also easy to understand. Uob one card need to have consecutive qtr spending of an amount to be entitled the cash rebate. Not 1cent less in the month. And the qtr is not calendar qtr etc. I gave up in the end..,btohqsg
Do check out Chris latest video,btohqsg
Ok  so I should topup this before mid month cpf from employment is in,btohqsg
Has ur interest come in for the prev month?,btohqsg
I'm still waiting but not sure which day will credit,btohqsg
As the part of musical chair game  switching the accounts for higher interest rate. Now planning to move funds from SCB esaver to RHB. Is it necessary to keep $1k sgd in esaver or can it be $0? Anybody switched out from SCB esaver earlier ? Pls advice. Thanks,btohqsg
U will still need to keep minimum in your esaver.,btohqsg
just $5 fall below fee if dun meet $1k adb or is there other impact?,btohqsg
What's the minimum need to keep? I tot is waived till Jun 23?,btohqsg
hello people  new to the miles game  appreciate some help from this community! i used dbs wwmc for some offline spends and maxed out the $2k spends limit unfortunately. i had online spends subsequently  can I check if those spends will still get the 4mpd?,btohqsg
yes my december one came in today  so did my friends' interests,btohqsg
The screenshot from IRAS seems to say that they have now combined the tax relief to a total of $8000 (for self) - up from the $7 000 that you could top up SA (the RSTU). So  my reading is that you can top up all 8k to the SA (if not at limit already)  or if at limit  then top up to MA. Is that correct?,btohqsg
Does anyone know how HDB determines ur income for the EHG grant? Haha like isit based on CPF only?,btohqsg
Yes  the bonus points applies for the first 2k of online spend  doesn't consider offline spend,btohqsg
You need to submit your past 12 months payslips and past 15 months CPF contribution history  then HDB will assess your income from there,btohqsg
Wa how come 15 months… if no CPF?,btohqsg
I think because it's the longest date range you can select from CPF website. If no CPF contributions then it won't show.,btohqsg
12 month income is actually sufficient  15 month CPF for good measure  HDB receives a lot of incomplete applications so their policies often requests for more,btohqsg
