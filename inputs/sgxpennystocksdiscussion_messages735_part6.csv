üéâPika World Daily Review ‚Äì 16 November 2022üéâüçèAnother sign of inflation coolingüßÆThe PPI had risen 8% over the year  which is lower than the 8.4% expected. Companies faced with a minor cost increase bode well for the inflation narrative. It hints that the selling prices of products could start to cool down and support a projected weaker inflation story for the future.The latest PPI data further validates the hint with the recent CPI data that inflation is possibly declining. This shows the comprehensive spread support of such a notion  and indexes could sustain their green despite geopolitical risk arising from the Ukraine war as missiles appeared to have hit NATO alliance country ‚Äì Poland.üïπIs Semiconductor turnaround on the horizon?üçÑAs we spoke about Uncle Warren's significant investment into TSMC  stock prices of many semiconductors rose sharply. Related counters such as AMD  QCOM and NVDA also increased with the optimism for the sector.The rosy outlook is also supported by Infineon  which has revised its long-term targets upward as semiconductors demand rose and its fourth-quarter earnings beat expectations. This fuels the rally as investors buy back laggards in the upward swing cycle.üé¢Can the market continue?üíéWith the sharp recovery of the indexes  say for the S&P 500  which had recovered by around 12% from its low of 3577 in early October  investors are getting ahead of the Fed in the pivot narrative  supported by recent data implying softening inflation.For traders  the S&P 500 is at a resistance level near the 4200 and 4300 levels  where we had sold massive sellers roaming in during the early part of the year. With rising risk-on sentiments  there are high odds that the rally could continue  but sellers could return.Pika World remains cautious in the near term. On valuation ground  if S&P 500 is to rise to the expected 4200 to 4300 level  it hints at the S&P 500 reaching around 18.5 times the total per shares earnings  which the companies are expected to roll in for next year. During this year  the low we hit was around 15 times.The companies' profits will reach about 5.4% of the total price at this multiple. This is just barely 1.6% higher than the 10-year Treasury yield. The additional equity risk premium  which has been around 4%  makes that valuation less appealing.As such  while we are confident of the long-term upward trajectory of the equity market in the face of better inflation reading  Pika World is mindful of the fundamentals and may switch to a tactically conservative stance.üìÆWhat's on the menu today?üìñAt 9.30 pm  we will send the Retail Sales data for MoM  which we expect to hit around 1% growth from just a natural 0% in the prior period.At 10.15 pm  we will also have the Industrial production data  which is expected to rise by a smaller 0.2% compared to 0.4% earlier.FOMC member Williams is also expected to speak at 10.50 pm  which will be critical. After all  the Fed has been trying to talk down on the market to sustain the decline in asset prices  hoping to impact consumption ability.It is 16 November  Wednesday  at 9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a productive day ahead!,btohqsg
