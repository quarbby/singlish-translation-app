Hi guys how's the Ccs from tengah?,btohqsg
I'm gonna collect my key on this year Aug,btohqsg
Hey guys  wanna find out/clarify some doubts:The 1st appt w HDB is to choose desired unit  pay option fee  sort out instalments plans?HDB loan amount stated in HFE is fixed or has anyone of you had your HDB loan amount re-assessed 9-mths prior to key collection?TIA!,btohqsg
First appointment only pay option fee and choose unit and confirm manner of holding (joint tenancy/tenancy in common/main applicant & essential occupier)HFE is a new scheme. Based on multiple data points from applicants emailing to HDB  they said that there would be no reassessment. Though they did say they will see reassessment on a case by case basis via appeal.,btohqsg
Hi just to clarify if that‚Äôs all we have to pay for for the first appointment  when do we need to pay the 20% down payment?,btohqsg
Are you eligible for staggered downpayment scheme?,btohqsg
How long after will that be from the first appointment?,btohqsg
Also just a note that it will be 5% or 10% at that point,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not too sure I have yet to check,btohqsg
The remainder will be at key collection,btohqsg
If you or your partner are under 30 years old you auto qualify,btohqsg
If you're under this scheme it's 5% at signing of lease appt  15% at key collection.Otherwise it's 10% 10%,btohqsg
should be around 6-9 months after  but you can also check with HDB when you go for the selection appt.If you qualify for EHG may be the longer end of the spectrum  otherwise may be on the shorter end of the spectrum,btohqsg
Can you go and check? It affects how much downpayment you have to pay during your second appointment (signing of lease agreement) and third appointment (nearer to key collection).Since you are eligible for staggered downpayment scheme  you will pay 5% of the unit price during your second appointment and 15% during your third appointment.,btohqsg
Got it should be in the HDB website as well right,btohqsg
I lay out the payments you need to do on your first  second and third appointment.First Appointment: Option fee 1-2k cash via NETS depending on your room type.Second Appointment: 5% of your unit price if you are under staggered downpayment scheme  otherwise it will be 10% of your unit price.Buyer stamp duty (low 10k to high 10k  near 20k)HDB conveyancing fees (few hundred dollars)If you are taking bank loan  10% of unit price  out of which 5% must be in cash if you are under staggered downpayment scheme  otherwise it will be 20% of unit price  out of which 5% must be in cash + BSD and HDB conveyancing fees + lawyer legal fees ($2.5k-3k)Third appointment: remaining 15% if under staggered downpayment scheme  otherwise remaining 10% plus  the other fees stated below,btohqsg
If 1 of us is above 30?,btohqsg
As long as one person qualifies,btohqsg
Btw  the total % depends on when your project was launched!,btohqsg
If above 30  is auto 10+10%?,btohqsg
The time between 1st and 2nd appointment roughly how long?,btohqsg
FYI in case anyone else is curious about the cut-off date for the % downpayment (NOTE this does not account for staggered downpayment scheme)https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/sign-agreement-for-lease,btohqsg
The age 30  is go by birthday month?,btohqsg
"HDB states ""Applied for a flat on or before the younger applicant‚Äôs 30th birthday"" -> so it should be by the day of your application  whether the younger applicant is under or 30 and abovehttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/sign-agreement-for-lease",btohqsg
I think the deferred assessment is still a valid schrme,btohqsg
