Just a follow up on earlier Hong Lai Huat Posting as mentioned after much study during that weekend  there was 1 serious concern that I had with regard to the counter.FYI  took the trouble to email them but did not get any response back from the company since 28th Sept.I feel it’s quite basic courtesy to get an acknowledgment reply at the very least  which I was surprised not to receive one.As much I wanted to size up and positioned bigger in it  really needed that assurance that the deal they have is in order. The last thing we want is that there could be any issue in the deal which will lead to potential legal matters.(Example like Asiatic having lawsuit in Cambodia 🇰🇭)Therefore  reduced the overall initial position first and will only pick up small position for now.Nevertheless  can tell there have been buyers absorbing 🧽 sellers this period but I need to have full conviction before daring to size up big.Anyways DYODD/ OSOD and react accordingly always 🙌,btohqsg

Dyna-Mac offer honestly I think is already reasonable and fair to most shareholders but yet everyone still not happy hah.Amos group (formerly Gaylin) $0.070 buy out offer is totally rubbish offer compared to Dyna Mac’s.Anyways  mentioned to gather the minorities of Amos earlier but thought it would likely be a futile attempt. But anyways  with some other retailers texting me on this.Let’s try to gather other Amos Shareholders together and hopefully together  we have a stronger voice.Do PM me with proof of shareholdings to join thanks 🙏,btohqsg

Gentle Reminder on this.Anyone found here giving overly high targets and looks like doing P&D  causing FOMO to make retailers buy while you dump will be kicked and banned from this group,btohqsg
If anyone suspects any others of carrying out such activities  kindly highlight to admins or myself too.Meantime  reminder to all  trade safely  responsibly and within own means always. DYODD and take accountability for own trades. Don't blindly follow. Lets strive to make all discussion a fruitful and beneficial one which can improve or hone our trading/investing skillset.,btohqsg
If I found who P&D I will arrow  him behindJoJo Feng,btohqsg
Anyways  those Amos shareholders  do PM me proof of S/Holdings to join in the group.Not sure what can come of it  but at least we should try our best to fight and together  have a stronger voice.,btohqsg

Please text me proof of holdings thanks,btohqsg
Although the offeror needs only another 7% shareholdings to hit 90% privatisation mark  i believe most will not accept the offer because their costs are way way higher.Hence  those holding have to be prepared that this can end up being a delisted counter.Perhaps  with the support of the Amos retailer group  we might be able to get the support of media / SIAS to look into this offer price and also offer some advice to retailers on what happens when it becomes delisted counter.Just a note. Aztech was then offered by the Mun family to delist at $0.42 back then but within the 1st year  issued the dividends of $0.40 . Hence  those who hanged on benefitted and actually got a windfall from what I have gathered too.Tough decision hence we need all the info and help.Source:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/GX3F9TAQJLBO4JLC/821561_Offer%20Document.pdfhttps://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/GX3F9TAQJLBO4JLC/821559_Dissemination%20Announcement.pdf,btohqsg
