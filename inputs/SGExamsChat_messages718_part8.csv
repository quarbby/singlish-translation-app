But for whatever reason the subjects where I like the classes the most  I did the most badly for them during As,btohqsg
Now I guess you don’t like uni Econs?,btohqsg
It is not that i dun like  the math is just hard to remember,btohqsg
(not because of econ so yeahh),btohqsg
And they dun make it as clear as in jc notes,btohqsg
Is it cos they just expect yall to be independent,btohqsg
I miss all classes except gp and chinese,btohqsg
As in do more self study,btohqsg
Any stuff that’s not clear to you they expect you to look it up yourself,btohqsg
One talks like telling story  the other talks like a bullet train,btohqsg
I hope those aren’t the same profs teaching Econs in chs,btohqsg
I thought siyan sent the pic with direct entry majors and common entry majors,btohqsg
No wait econs is in chs what,btohqsg
No reason for it to be different,btohqsg
I just made my nail defect worst,btohqsg
This one was since December sia still there,btohqsg
Coz I accidentally let the hotel room door (which is damn heavy) slam on my thumb,btohqsg
And retarded in removing my thumb,btohqsg
Just have to hope it regrows quickly,btohqsg
Idk if it will be gone as i cut my nails,btohqsg
I thought it would grow up,btohqsg
And yes coz i dk what i was doing  i just made the hole bigger lol,btohqsg
So basically after a few months it should be gone,btohqsg
I didnt know nails take forever to grow,btohqsg
But finally i see it nearing the top,btohqsg
If you lose a whole nail it should be fully regrown in under a year,btohqsg
Wait that looks like a beer,btohqsg
I should stop peeling it  let worst got infection,btohqsg
Don’t peel  use a nail file,btohqsg
If you don’t have then best to leave it alone,btohqsg
Wait how does telegram allow these stickers,btohqsg
U planning to go chs econs?,btohqsg
And w more minors on telegram these days,btohqsg
I guess so. But I didn’t specify the major in my application,btohqsg
I’m thinking of putting Econs as my first major and polsci second but I can also change,btohqsg
Might want to try history or geog,btohqsg
In the past you had to?,btohqsg
Oh you mean if I mix Econs and polsci,btohqsg
Then it might be somewhat similar,btohqsg
My Econs Cher was like ppe in Singapore is just for flexing only lol,btohqsg
We just following what the prestigious unis in UK do like Oxford by creating a similar course,btohqsg
My econs cher told me she can see i hv passion in econs snd can consider uni econs lol,btohqsg
I definitely have passion for Econs but I’m scared that once I see all the math I’ll hate it,btohqsg
Hmmm yea the math can be a pain,btohqsg
Also I’m still thinking about whether to retake Econs this year or next,btohqsg
It seems that for some reason this year’s paper besides me some other ppl who normally do well for econs got a worse grade than expected for As,btohqsg
Then some ppl online who retook econs said their grade fell compared to 2022,btohqsg
I guess it’s just unlucky I happened to sit for this year’s paper cos sometimes it’s possible that for some particular questions you write stuff that Cambridge examiners don’t want even if normally most other stuff you can hit it,btohqsg
i mean... its not difficult to buy a new sim card and create a new telegram account just to lurk here  to see what marks@Randkmdkdgives his students,btohqsg
I dun actually think it got to do w the papers coz they cant let the whole cohort w/o As or things like that,btohqsg
