Hi! Can share nov SBF group?,btohqsg
hello  any tele link for woodlands glade?,btohqsg
Just search for woodlands glade bto üëç,btohqsg
actually it cannot be found. think it‚Äôs private,btohqsg
same case for fernvale glades.. no telegram link also üòï,btohqsg
Telegram Is quiet. Think they are active in WhatsApp group. Capacity maxed. WhatsApp not available.  Only Facebook still have some activities.,btohqsg
Woah might be true that Bayshore gonna have hdb. But the price for this area gonna be expensive,btohqsg
Erm I think they wont build 2 mrt stations just to serve a 'forested area' plus some bits of private estate,btohqsg
So ya  this will be the new 'marine parade' of 2030s,btohqsg
another expensive premium places . But over the past year I didn‚Äôt see Marine Parade having new bto ü§£,btohqsg
So probably gonna be high sub,btohqsg
Marine parade no BTO for decades liao ba,btohqsg
The plot is between two MRT stations on the upcoming Thomson-East Coast Line (TEL) - Bayshore and Bedok South - and is expected to have facilities and services such as schools  shops and an integrated transport hub.,btohqsg
ok lo got new mrt build,btohqsg
Yes  integrated transport hub need to serve high density high rise public housing to make sense.,btohqsg
Lucky I never buy Daffodil condo,btohqsg
The unit was so nice with bedrooms facing complete greenery,btohqsg
Next time it gonna face construction and all high rise HDB,btohqsg
The feel of that estate will be gone forever...,btohqsg
hdb used to be a greenery with trees and plant . Until when hdb decided to build more bto and housing  there‚Äôs goes hdb facing each other,btohqsg
Used to. Now is HDB take over greenery. -> dover,btohqsg
Temasek Poly will see enhanced intake capacity due to all the building up of hdb on that side,btohqsg
East side already over heated island heat effect leh,btohqsg
"The relocation of Paya Lebar Airbase from 2030 will free up 800 hectares of land ‚Äì equivalent to about five Toa Payoh towns. This will be progressively transformed into a ""highly liveable and sustainable‚Äù new town  according to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).",btohqsg
So SG still has plenty of land... only thing is how not to affect the liveability in terms of heat buildup  displacement of nature and flora fauna and flooding.,btohqsg
Yes surely hdb will have plenty of land like for the Tengah estate~,btohqsg
Sg now v humidity already. Need air con installed for all new btoüòÖüòÇ but there goes air con bill üí∏,btohqsg
Tengah has central cooling tower option,btohqsg
I read somewhere that it is 'optional'.,btohqsg
my only worry is my retirement plan,btohqsg
World is crises everywhere  with the pandemic and loss of jobs  military action  industrial actions,btohqsg
Each day wake up alive n well is a blessing already.... still worry about retirement? LOL,btohqsg
Hi guys  my hubby just received a email from hbd say that the contractor for bukit batok sky vista  has ran out of money,btohqsg
Hi  anyone can advise normally how long time take for first appointment?,btohqsg
Same my bto project too. Sigh,btohqsg
depends on your ballot number  they would start with only a few and progressively after that,btohqsg
average 9-15 a day overall also depends on the size of the project,btohqsg
5 BTO projects in Bukit Batok  Clementi  Bukit Panjang and Woodlands face further delays as contractor goes busthttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/5-hdb-projects-in-bukit-batok-clementi-bukit-panjang-and-woodlands-face-further,btohqsg
How can contractor run out of money,btohqsg
Hdb never do due diligence when selecting contractors ah,btohqsg
So effects of pandemic and economic strife are start to hit,btohqsg
Their margin is very low. Usually 5 to 15%,btohqsg
The main contractors for 5 BTO projects in Singapore are unable to continue due to financial difficulties. HDB will find new firms to take over construction  but further delays are expected.https://cna.asia/3gAfAQX,btohqsg
No la  all projects are pay as you build. Meaning to say the difficulties unlikely to come from the bto more from their other operations,btohqsg
Which means the financial health of the contractor was not assessed properly before appointing them.. sad,btohqsg
Hope the delay will not be more than an additional year,btohqsg

No worries  already during CB last year kena stop work for months.... got gaps or defects already 'built in',btohqsg
