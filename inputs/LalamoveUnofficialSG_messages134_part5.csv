We bikes always get abused. Make the trip only to see the items bulky. CCB!,btohqsg
I always insist they top up if the order and items don’t match up.,btohqsg
Provided you can take them all. If not? Please don’t take the orders and spoil the other riders who refuse to comply with their demands. Trust me. No good will come out of it. You’re just going to make the other riders who refuse to take their orders  look like black sheeps.,btohqsg
@the 2 idiots…if you are in this Telegram group chat  wake the F up!!!,btohqsg
Hello  my father accepted a scammed job. He paid for the items that the scammer asked him to purchase. Anyone had the same experience and has contact for the Lalamove customer service?,btohqsg
Yes  make police report and just to make clear for everyone. All purchasing item customer have to transfer the money to you 1st in order for you to proceed with the job. If not  please live chat with LLM to cancel.,btohqsg
Follow protocol and wont be dissapointed.After accepting order  must call sender or receiver to confirm on what item supposed to be collected and how big. If it exceed ask them to cancel & rebook for the right mode of vehicle.if happen they mention just small item and u arrived and it wasnt small. Cancel the job and ask for 50% compensation fees.,btohqsg

Llm platform so cheap. Most i guess homeless & beggars. It started early last year till now. The fare getting lower and so many took it. Illegal foreigner doing... singaporean can now slowly die.. MOM/LTA already been notified. Best of luck for those who really think its worth bending the rule.,btohqsg
Is not begger and homeless doing it,btohqsg
Is all those work permit and foreigner using other people account doing it,btohqsg
Said many times  as long lalamove don’t come out with face verification All work permit will continue snatch your job,btohqsg

Riding already so stress. Still need to take care of the pondan,btohqsg
Potted plants must be kept upright or the soil/water spills out. Too tall for normal box or underseat and usually too fragile to strap on back seat. Putting between legs is the best option  provided it's a platform scooter.,btohqsg
