or maybe it does but he js missing additional style parts,btohqsg
somethings up with the front and fenders too,btohqsg
oh wait front is ok but the fitment,btohqsg
wheel wider than the car itself,btohqsg
maybe because it's missing the dimples?,btohqsg
no la   lbwk full kit is liddat one,btohqsg
the wheels look too skinny for the wbk,btohqsg
idk why but it gives me the lbwk copen vibes eh@iamiggy,btohqsg
should be looking like this if owner wants an actual lbwk look,btohqsg
front bumper   canard   fender   bonnet all lbwk tho,btohqsg
see the part above the plate,btohqsg
gtr badge also like alm cannot see,btohqsg
that's the 2017+ GTR grille right?,btohqsg
yeah I think that's why it looks weird@iamiggy,btohqsg
wait i show u full kit brb,btohqsg
owner using V2 kit   but rear is from v1 so maybe thats why,btohqsg
i think he using v1 rear bumper w v2 diffuser,btohqsg
that is one ugly rear end.,btohqsg
the chassis mounted wing ruins it,btohqsg
if it had a swan neck wing it might work better.,btohqsg
then again  i generally do not like riveted  not-flushed bodykits.,btohqsg
Fr chassis mount wing so nonsense unless its like a gt3 style car,btohqsg
and they're few and far between these days as manufacturers tend to lean towards swan neck wings,btohqsg
i.e Audi R8 GT3 Evo II,btohqsg
or the 992 GT3 (the GT3 race car  though the road GT3/3RS has them too),btohqsg
I think the P1 GTR looks sexy with the wing,btohqsg
it does. even the Lanzante road converted ones are dope,btohqsg
those cars deserve over-the-top  absolutely batshit insane wings,btohqsg
but slapping that type of chassis mounted wing on your S15/GTR/generic tuner car is errrrrrr,btohqsg
the fuck are the GT86s going to do?,btohqsg
the drag is going to overcome the lacklustre engine lol,btohqsg
the 718 is on fucking base model wheels,btohqsg
only thing i hate in car scene is takeovers and emo overly stanced cars,btohqsg
the 718 is on stock looking wheels with a 6ft wing?? wtf?,btohqsg
Got money for the wrap and wing but not wheels priorities,btohqsg
it’s the lb ver 2 kit but not an authentic one,btohqsg
What in the bodykit is that,btohqsg
oh this one  only seen pics haha dont think ive seen it irl,btohqsg
it’s a replica of the axell kit,btohqsg
early 2010s spotters will rmb these three,btohqsg
yk what if it was 2015 i wld call this sick,btohqsg
Not a big fan of the body kit tho,btohqsg
If bumblebee landed in singapare cfm choose one of the 3 since here no camaros (i think),btohqsg
i dont think there are any camaros at all,btohqsg
Oh yea in fact this particular gtr used to look even worsehttps://www.instagram.com/p/COuf8iksC7s/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==,btohqsg
the stock rims makes it utterly disgusting,btohqsg
My first car was an EP3,btohqsg
It was the cheapest thing out there,btohqsg
the one Type R that doesn't look like one,btohqsg
Not rlly it was just rusted as shit internally,btohqsg
