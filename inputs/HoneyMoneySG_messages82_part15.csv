If you don't have consistent monthly insurance payment  alternative is buy vouchers lor.. because most insurance premiums increase when changing from annual to monthly,btohqsg
Oh  Thanks! Such as the NTUC vouchers,btohqsg
Correct. I mean day to day you should have some spending.. I'm aware that some ppl can spend only 200-300 each month  so sometimes difficult to meet the 500... If really cannot meet then use it for the reset month  spend 500 including vouchers then at least following month when back in OCBC just use the vouchers to spend instead lor..,btohqsg
