Pffttt … I cannot get over it,btohqsg
That civic was what I wanted leh!,btohqsg
Loll…how the heck managed to do that,btohqsg
I in same situation. Tivoli looks like best option right now. Got Peugeot and Citroen options in similar price range but many people say dont buy French. Qashqai that 1.2l engine is not sufficient I think.,btohqsg
French cars not common in SG. Want go outside repair or buy parts expensive,btohqsg
Ya but parf car only like 5-8 years old. Got so many problems meh?,btohqsg
5th year onwards is when all the taiji come out one bro.,btohqsg
The extra money you pay for a honda,btohqsg
Oh? I didn’t know. I thought the dig-t engines rarely have issues. Gearbox should be a cvt  I don’t foresee any problems.Of course the 2.0 will run smoother than the 1.2. But cost will be slightly higher.,btohqsg
I heard some car clubs charges admin fees,btohqsg
but never heard of any different cost for Honda,btohqsg
Japanese car in singapore got JDM tax one,btohqsg
I doubt its just for jdm,btohqsg
It’s sg tax applies for all,btohqsg
You tell me which car more overpriced than japanese car,btohqsg
Sg buyers are willing also in some ways,btohqsg
I think porsches are “reasonably” priced,btohqsg
Everything is reasonably price if you put it like that,btohqsg
Got one time got one evo 9,btohqsg
iPhone 15 is reasonably priced at one kidney each,btohqsg

I also catch no ball but I suddenly feel rich for driving a jdm 🤭,btohqsg
Kia the new toyota and mazda the new honda 😂😂😂 gonna stir more 😂😂,btohqsg
Kia & Hyundai aren't they like sister company lol,btohqsg
The thing about Korean car is that because in the past they tend to have many problem  so many older generation buyer / mechanic still think they sucks,btohqsg
my coe Hyundai has been pretty solid,btohqsg
Recently I think Hyundai have 10 year warranty for their engine for their new car  but people end up thought is because their engine lousy that is why give 10 year warranty 🙃,btohqsg
My friend also say very solid,btohqsg
Shouldn’t it be viewed as Kia is confident that their engine won’t have issues so they dare to guarantee 10yrs. If got issues  they want to chop chop wash hands off it ma,btohqsg
even my korean colleague ask me to avoid Korean cars 🤷,btohqsg
I guess depend how we see it la. Malaysian driver also not too keen on Korean car. I heard the Korean distributor there need to lower the car price and add in more freebies to attract buyer away from Japanese or Malaysian car (myvi  perodua etc..),btohqsg
Their design is damn good though,btohqsg
The recent avante and the new Kona look damn good,btohqsg
Avante still have ? Thought no more,btohqsg
Their Myvi  perodua very cheap there.. JDM tax also exist in Msia.,btohqsg
See the civics also quite ex.,btohqsg
FC not so much though. Best I gotten was 16km/l but most instances is between 10-13km/l,btohqsg
Acceptable la  my 2016 altis now is like 11-12 km/l.,btohqsg
Thought Altis quite good FC one,btohqsg
