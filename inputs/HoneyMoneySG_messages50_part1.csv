Today is Friday again and that means $3 cashback from DBS Paylah Hawker promo!ðŸ‘‰ DBS Paylah $5 code CHRHAF684I got Roast Chicken Rice today.In Singapore  people couldn't agree on whether roast chicken rice or poached chicken rice was better. Some loved the crispy and flavorful roast chicken with its golden skin  while others preferred the tender and subtle taste of poached chicken. However  wise food lovers realized that both dishes had their own special qualities  and Singapore embraced the idea that both could coexist and be enjoyed by different people with different tastes. So  are you a roast chicken or poached chicken person?Cost of meal: $3.50Cost of drink: $1.00DBS Cashback: ($3.00)Net cost for lunch: $1.50ðŸ‘‰ Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgðŸ‘‰ More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg

I bought apple products from their online store  using my Citi Rewards Mastercard. However no bonus 10x points were credited.Other purchases made on the apple online store but paid using my amaze card (which is paired to the citi rewards Mastercard) were credited 10x bonus points. Any reason for the difference? Any help is appreciated!!,btohqsg
can ask them for refund?like kana cheat,btohqsg
Monthly transfer in $15k  then withdraw immediately can? (Meaning less than 200k in the account),btohqsg
I think this is more on citiâ€™s end. They have been very confusing I must say. Itâ€™s weird that the Citi person listed out  some of my apple transactions have 10x points  and some that donâ€™t. Then I went to look into it and realised only the amaze ones have 10x. All have been done on the online store. Waiting on their reply still. Hope Iâ€™ll have a resolution. So much headache ðŸ¥¹ thanks all for the help. Really appreciate it.,btohqsg

Hello all  may I ask. Im gonna pay for a cruise soon. I'm accruing Kris miles  would the instarem + Citi rewards be the best option still?,btohqsg
Nope. Citi doesn't cover travel mccs. So cruise is not eligible for rewards,btohqsg
Oh thanks Andrew  then would be the next best option for miles,btohqsg
Hsbc revol for 4mpd. But I would probs use cimb visa signature for 10%,btohqsg
ooh. how about the amex kris?,btohqsg
Can but u won't get 4mpd. I think only 1.2mpd for the amex kf ascend,btohqsg
Ahhh. Worth for the first time bonus miles ?,btohqsg
Dear gru can I check can I use Maybank visa platinum to pay for utilities,btohqsg
Dun seem to exclude on the tnc but just to be confirm thanks,btohqsg
hi all do i earn 4mpd for concert tickets using amaze + citi rewards ?,btohqsg
If you buy online  Citi rewards card itself can earn 10x points per dollar (4mpd). Tried on ticketmaster,btohqsg
Yes if contribute to sign up bonus then it's worth it imo,btohqsg
Ah ok sounds good. Will consider.Actually sometimes I'm a bit confused. Pardon for the following noob question. If I were to use Instarem+Citi Rewards. Won't this always be considered as an online purchase and qualify for 10x bonus (cap at 10K)? So means I can always use Instarem even for cruises/ utilities/ taxes?,btohqsg
How to convert ah? Just call in?,btohqsg
Hello  anyone know if it is worth transfer krispay miles to kris flyer?,btohqsg
Nope there's exclusion list. Can refer to it online. Travel and all the usual like insurance etc are not eligible for 10x,btohqsg
if you're a miles person  of course worth it...,btohqsg
if you're a cashback user  stack and claim for NTUC vouchers only when got milesback promo,btohqsg
Hi. Taking into account the reduction in hsbc EGA interest. Is it still better compare to uob account with savings below 100k?,btohqsg
Ah makes sense. But will still get the base points?,btohqsg
R any of you looking to buy stocks in USA mkt? What stock ticker will u be looking at or had just bought?,btohqsg
No. Amaze changes the type of spend to online. But it doesn't change the MCC of the spend.,btohqsg
Oh it's different categories. I get it now. Thanks man,btohqsg
Yes... So travel spend  even if it's online still won't earn you 10x doe citi rewards because those are specifically excluded.,btohqsg
EIR is 5% right? And if only 500  its only .65%,btohqsg
Base point is 0.4mpd. Don't do that. It's a waste.,btohqsg
Hi all  just want to confirm if i understand hsbc revol t&c correctly.There is a monthly cap of 9000 bonus points. So only the first $1000 spend is eligible for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Ahh okies. Does it have expiring if i convert it to kris flyer?,btohqsg
