I think I just 1 car will do and donâ€™t take loan,btohqsg
2nd car coe should be 150% followed by 200% for 3rd car,btohqsg

Yes and pointless to control also as our policy is a car lite policy,btohqsg
Sadly i fall under the 2.0%  life has been tough. Petrol so expensive  still wanna raise GSTðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
So might just want till let top 20% own car will do,btohqsg
U are those didnâ€™t declare salary 1 is if,btohqsg
Which also the argument that they donâ€™t drive all cars at the same time for those registered under same name.,btohqsg
if you increase COE by 120k  so basically 220k  it will solve the issue,btohqsg
They lump everything above $20k together,btohqsg
Actually I agree that 20 k is too low for too bracker,btohqsg
