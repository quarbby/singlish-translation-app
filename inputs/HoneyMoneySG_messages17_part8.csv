Hi guys im just starting to get into the miles games. May i know if it's better to get a Citi Rewards Mastercard + Instarem Amaze OR HSBC Revolution VISA?,btohqsg
Ill say amaze + crmc better. But i feel the days of amaze with crmc is just limited. So revo might be safer,btohqsg
The reason why crmc is better is due to amaze right?,btohqsg
it depends what u spend on,btohqsg
Hmm lets just say for food  transport and grab mostly,btohqsg
HSBC can hit all this less the public transport part,btohqsg
Im using LiveFresh for simply go now,btohqsg
Yeah if not consider SCB smart card,btohqsg
UOB kris flyer for 3mpd works too,btohqsg
this one need to qualify for the min spend for sia products?,btohqsg
means if i buy something from krisshop via kris+  the $800 also counted ?,btohqsg
Kris+ no. Must be kris shop direct,btohqsg
thought there are datapoints that say kris+ counted to the $800,btohqsg
are crmc points the same as Citi thankyou points ?,btohqsg
Since titanium card ocbc has a cap of 12 k ocbc$ does it mean that i can spend all 12 k at one go per calender yr to get the 10x?,btohqsg

Morning to all  just curious to confirm  paying for grab/tada/gojek with amaze card tag to Citi rewards MC. Can still earn reward points right? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg

10x points. 10x points =4 mpd,btohqsg

Closing up the topic I started earlier - UOB Absolute vs AMEX TCB.UOB Absolute been pending for over 1.5 months.AMEX TCB got approved in 1.5 days.,btohqsg
Uob slow when I apply for uob one I pre myself to be slower but Heng I got it within 2 weeks,btohqsg
I got my UOB One account in 2 days. That one they veryyyyyy fast  cuz they wanna get your money. But when it comes to giving us good interest  or the initial sign up promo for CC  they like to take their own sweet time ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
Have to probably call in and check with Citibank. I will do so soon or check my points against my current month spent on card.Btw anyone knows for Citi Rewards tag amaze  Shopback and Grab online (pay travel insurance) payments qualifies for:- 1 x points- and 9 x pointsðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Iâ€™m using amaze/Citi rewards for all transactions except for travel related.HSBC Revolution for Travel related transactions ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
Crazy to hear UOB takes donkey years to approve. Mine was fast enough. Recently got my SC smart card application rejected. There goes my 6% cashback for public transport. Using HSB Revolution for the moment ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
Don't use Revo HSBC for simply go is crappy %%,btohqsg
I think i have to much credit cards. Should I cancel some not using? What is maximum number I can hold  ratio of annua income to number of cards?,btohqsg
If u got amex TCB remember check app offer tab,btohqsg
And enroll for the offers sometime git damn good deals,btohqsg
Hmm ðŸ¤” is there other cards to use? Cause Iâ€™m playing miles game. Place all my daily expense on Citi rewards and HSB revolution.,btohqsg
