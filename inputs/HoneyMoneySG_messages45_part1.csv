Any other bank can cancel via app? I got Cimb and others to cancel also. Play the new to bank game every year,btohqsg
DBS iirc.You have to call to cancel OCBC  Citi and Amex cards definitely.,btohqsg
Amex usually can waive annual fee? I got the low tier plat,btohqsg
No  at best 50% waiver for tcb lately,btohqsg
Hmm.. my plat under utilised. If can’t waive  probably say good bye,btohqsg
Good call. Better to cancel any credit card that we don't use much and don't get much stuff.Even for those cards that we get 10 000 miles every year for paying Annual Fees  we have to ask  is this worth the miles buying?,btohqsg
Thank  you . Which are the card that offer 4 mpd when tagged to amaze ?,btohqsg
Citi Rewards (non travel spend though)  OCBC TR (certain categories),btohqsg
For citi reward if we are using amaze card overseas eg pay for hotel   car rental ? It don qualify ?,btohqsg
may i know what can i spend the $1000 on for hsbc revolution sign up gift? can buy giant vouchers?,btohqsg
whatever u usually spend on  ideally that earns 4mpd,btohqsg
Sorry a silly question   do u use the amaze card locally ? It would earn miles too right,btohqsg
I thought KF credit card with KF saving account can earn up to 6mpd?,btohqsg
Hi all can I get an opinion on something: do y’all get annoyed when your friends/family members use the wrong credit card? Then when you try to correct them  they get annoyed at you lol. I just mean well and want to help them maximise their cashback/miles.,btohqsg
got such thing?Edit: forgotten about it as it was not worth it.,btohqsg
Provided it is in the x10 whitelist and also swipe the card does not earn 4mpd.,btohqsg
Hello all. I’m currently on Royal Caribbean cruise and I had some spending on board. If I use the uob visa signature  does it counted as the 1k min spend ?,btohqsg
Depends on who is the person   but if only friend  try not to kaypoh lah,btohqsg
In my case is parents haha,btohqsg
Experienced similar response last time when I shared with friends why they should not be using their default savings account with miserable interest  why they should make use of open electricity market providers promo etc. Now I don't care already unless people ask me.,btohqsg
ah ok  but miles earned capped at 5% of savings. interest at 0.05% only  so not worth it,btohqsg
Some people just feel that it's not worth their time with all the hassle. They do not understand that all these little savings and earnings do add up to quite significant amount.,btohqsg
I failed to keep track of average daily balance too!,btohqsg
use Excel  it's quite straightforward actually.,btohqsg
Can share me how you do?1. Because the OCBC Average Daily Balance seems like is compare currently month with last month if I understand correctly. 2. How about comparing Jan (31 days) and Feb (28/29 days)??,btohqsg
for previous month daily average balance. check your statement. it's listed there.,btohqsg
so you just need to target to get an amount that's 500 more than the previous month daily average balance. add one dollar more if worried about rounding differences.,btohqsg
then in excel  track day end balance for each day of the month in each row.,btohqsg
2. The formula for average daily balance cater for different number of days in a month,btohqsg
then one column to sum the cumulative daily ending balance,btohqsg
then one column to divide the cumulative daily ending balance with the day of the month,btohqsg
Very common. Not everyone likes to min max.,btohqsg
The issue is they don’t see the rewards so they don’t understand/feel it,btohqsg
last time when I shared about how to get 10% cashback with UOB one and Grabpay + earn grabpoints  people also very skeptical.,btohqsg
Yes haha. that time even paying income tax earn grabpoints.,btohqsg
I planning to Aust  if I link hsbc revol card to amaze card and use for Uber and coles supermarket. Will I get 10x points?,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone with experience of selling their current HDB and buying a resale? Current HDB belongs to my above 65 parents,btohqsg
My personal experience  firstly is the tone it is communicated  no one wants to be the ignorant one so how the info is put across to them is important. Secondly  it is insignificant in a grander scheme of things  5% cashback is $50  unless you spend $1000 and it is one big ticket item  it might not be worthwhile to track the expenses in the different cards. Leave it to those people who are interested to scrimp and save to do it  it's a personal choice.,btohqsg
Anyway  ADB is means that to keep track everyday balance in OCBC360.To hit the save bonus  I make sure I have 500sgd additional as compared to previous month date?,btohqsg
If I use Evol contactless with samsung pay  ntuc grocery counts for 8 percent as well?,btohqsg
6.6% only.The real 8% is Citibank cashback.,btohqsg
effectively 6.67% cos 8% capped for $250 spend for mobile contactless  $250 online  but need $600 min spend.,btohqsg
Ok cos my card usage mainly dining and ntuc grocery. I want to move to UOB One from OCBC 365,btohqsg
Then u should move to Citibank cashback based on your needs,btohqsg
If i can earn 6.6% is good enough cos the main driver is to get 5% on savings account for my 100k,btohqsg
But then petrol need to find another card. Ocbc 365 really fit the bill but average daily balance is kind of annoying,btohqsg
Citi no savings acc that can match upb one 5%. I want something for my salary crediting acc to max out interest on 100k savings,btohqsg
U confusing me. U moving to evol or uob one,btohqsg
U can have the cake and eat it.Go for uob one $500 tier or uob evol $600. With savings account $100k.Then also use Citibank cashback.,btohqsg
yes and not to exceed 500 by too much if you already have 100k inside,btohqsg
