i dont have time ti look into this to fix,btohqsg
on balance  i dare say mazda quality is better,btohqsg

tired la. waste a lot of time,btohqsg
at some stage of life you will appreciate reliability is most important. this is how the japanese taught us. like how honda rewrites supercars that can be driven everyday too,btohqsg
Car Review - Seat Ibiza 1.5 EcoTSI DSG FR Plus (A)The Seat Ibiza goes head-to-head against the Ford Fiesta  Honda Jazz  Suzuki Swift  Skoda Scala and the Volkswagen Polo!Which of these hatchbacks would you pick?👉🏻 React with ❤️ for the Seat Ibiza!👉🏻 React with 🥰 for the Honda Jazz!👉🏻 React with 😁 for the Suzuki Swift!👉🏻 React with 👏🏻 for the Skoda Scala!👉🏻 React with 👍🏻 for the Volkswagen Polo!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
in the past we often thought supercars cant be driven everyday. this is the euro way,btohqsg
just like if you own a civic type r. you want to be able to revv it high and yet drive it everyday with such reliability. and low maintenance costs,btohqsg
haha exactly why i got volvolor,btohqsg
u just want a comfortable stylish ride from point A-B,btohqsg
why u dont like altis ah HAHA,btohqsg
"altis is quite dangerous. it can ""buang"" easily when you corner fast",btohqsg
nowadays i feel toyota not worth buying because they premium also high,btohqsg
😂😂😂 no say boring la but there are cheaper alternatives that provide the same quality,btohqsg
altis not boring? oh no. you have veered to the toyota side. but be objective,btohqsg
here i dont debate reliability and ruggedness. toyota is very good and so is mazda nissan,btohqsg
but among the 3 toyota is known to be boring,btohqsg
if you dont mind this then okay. i owned a vios for 4 years i know,btohqsg
u can make any car fun tbh,btohqsg
ony thing failed is water pump and fan motor,btohqsg
if a car is inherently built this way  no amount of mods can change the basic characteristics.,btohqsg
its like driving a Russian Lada fast  its more of thrill than being fast haha,btohqsg
i have seen those TGR with vios and it looked quite fun tbh HAHA,btohqsg
that is why i buy a fun car with good fundamantals and drive. i dont modify car.,btohqsg
In stock form  it caters to its target audience. Drive a car from Point A to B lor,btohqsg
so  instead of buying altis to modiy  why not buy a mazda 3 that has the fun genes in it,btohqsg
mazda 4 is also from a to b,btohqsg
Mazda 3 is abit more expensive right?,btohqsg
ehh mazda 2 is a toyota yaris leh,btohqsg
dont destory cars with mods. maybe it's me. but that is what i do,btohqsg
u sat in a mazda 2 before anot,btohqsg
i cldnt even fit in the rear seats,btohqsg
it is a basic car budget car but at least fun la,btohqsg
i feel like too small car also dangerous,btohqsg
some harleys have wider tires than them  not sure how safe it is during rainy conditions,btohqsg
Toyota Yaris is a rebadged mazda2,btohqsg
mazda 2 is far more better than yaris la. it uses the fun skyactiv auto trans,btohqsg
maybe the floor plan body rmaisn that of yaris. but the change in trans has changed it fromn boring to lively,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/yvFHtR6-PaQsurely this is a LOT better than yaris,btohqsg
or hear what he has to say...https://youtu.be/f-KtOndcUg4,btohqsg
Boss altis not a brand leh 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Haha. So far I only know altos Toyota responses,btohqsg
I should really stop replying to bots,btohqsg
I’ve getting messaged by them ALOT,btohqsg
The other one looking for company still around also 🤣,btohqsg
Ah that’s why we are keeping her 😂,btohqsg
Brembo calipers use wad colour nicest?,btohqsg
Because red goes well with black la,btohqsg
And interior all black as well or have another color?,btohqsg
If all black  can go with anything honestly  just need to make sure you don't mismatch with other details you might have,btohqsg
😆 common because the combination works ma,btohqsg
Must tie in the colours in a smooth way,btohqsg
If you wanna be unique go for pink,btohqsg
Wah then need to respray. Will ppl think it’s fake?,btohqsg
Idk if you're trolling or what sia..,btohqsg
I mean you spray to what you want,btohqsg
Brembo always those Color then u come out with pink,btohqsg
The calipers are more for your braking performance gain not aesthetics,btohqsg
Any bbk also can spray brembo and not many people can tell the difference,btohqsg
For aesthetics you spray however and put on the logo can alr,btohqsg
if uw spray blue might as well buy endless,btohqsg
People might say fake  might say real. Why bother when you know it's real,btohqsg
nashin is value for money and their grey bbk also nice,btohqsg
Lime green on black is very nice  so is red/orange/gold,btohqsg
Actually  one can order in any colour on special order from brembo,btohqsg
It's just the the ready stock is usually more common colours like silver  black  red  white  yellow  etc.,btohqsg
Just choose whatever yoy think is nice if you wanna be unique then choose a rare color  that's all there is to it,btohqsg
Really depends on the whole scheme of things  if the car is just all black everywhere no other colours at all  can go with anything,btohqsg
If there's other elements in another color  need to consider matching them,btohqsg
If you want the color to last  go to a decent spray shop they will need to prep the surface then spray  if those cheap can spray ones anyone also can do,btohqsg
Bbk no need lah if you never whack,btohqsg
If you don't want original color spray before install... if not double job,btohqsg
but tbh if u heavy foot  it’ll save ur a$$ on many occasions,btohqsg
I want change rim colour to chrome black. Ws say can’t do,btohqsg
chrome black is just darker black lol,btohqsg
More shiny then gloss black right?,btohqsg
if not gonna go speed trial  just get cheap taiwan bbk and spray,btohqsg
The stock brake look like w.t.f,btohqsg
These are calendar things leh… even if you don’t drive plastic or rubber will still degrade,btohqsg
Y bbk install so long? Told me need 5 hrs,btohqsg
Mainly because of the brake fluid,btohqsg
In the meantime go drink kopi,btohqsg
I tot is just replace rotor n calipers,btohqsg

Need to bleed out brake fluid Mr Pete,btohqsg
Also please make sure to bed in your rotors and pads once the install is done,btohqsg
Follow the manufacturer recommended bedding in cycle,btohqsg
Refers to repeated heating and cooling of the rotors and pads by applying the brakes and letting them cool down,btohqsg
It's done to make sure there is even wear throughout the life of the pads and the rotors and also extract the most performance from your brake setup,btohqsg
Must be done everytime you change your pads  and especially need to do if you change your rotors,btohqsg
Brembo will have a guide along with your brakes on what's the exact process and cycle to follow for your model of rotors and brakes,btohqsg
No wonder they say car like gf or wife. Bleed and pads things.,btohqsg
Then must have proper technique to bedding also.,btohqsg
Nvm better delete  don't dox full plate 😅,btohqsg
Technique and effectiveness more important than size with braking too,btohqsg
they legit drive like they own the road one,btohqsg
Lately I saw many Volvos. Seem to have 缘 with me. But soon many gave way when they saw boss car charging hard,btohqsg
How often do you check oil level,btohqsg
I check once a week. Its a habit  be it new or pre-owned car. 😁😁😁,btohqsg
I used to do that. Not anymore,btohqsg
Yeah. Mine too. M3. Oil sensor,btohqsg
if its abit above the required  there will be a warning,btohqsg
I don’t like it at all,btohqsg
High risk but cannot do anything about it if all cars follow this 'trend'.,btohqsg
but i honestly dont see the need to unless u know ur car is burning excess oil or there isnt a sensor,btohqsg
i can check exactly how much oil there is in car,btohqsg
only downside is that when i wna work on the car at home  makes it tough lor,btohqsg
Here are some of the cars I'll be proud to be seen driving inI would be proud to be seen driving in (most) COE-renewed JDM cars😏👉🏻 Which car/cars would you be proud to be seen driving in?➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
actually  there are 3 Land Rover Defender in SG that are not commercially registered,btohqsg
So they dont have the 20 years life span,btohqsg
Oil sensor is really unnecessary. We already have oil pressure. It’s good enough. Besides dipstick way is easier for drivers to check oil level. The best method.,btohqsg
Oil change every 10kArd 5k will check but seldom now😂Because Honda Engine don't drink engine oil.,btohqsg
Internally there’s already oil temperature and pressure,btohqsg
Yes. Same with my boss car. I never check. It’s so good it doesn’t require checking or tip up,btohqsg
Like Japanese Kei Car. Daihastu Copen😂,btohqsg
Wow all super car should some like this 😂Lesser noise public nuisance 😂,btohqsg
Yes I agree actually it sound better then super car,btohqsg
