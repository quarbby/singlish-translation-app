hey guys  may i ask for HSBC EGA  how do yall get the 1% cashback on insurance premiums?do yall pay the insurance premiums with a credit card then GIRO to that CC's bank for the bank to deduct from your EGA?im looking into the 1% cashback before opening it upalso  understand from some chat history above that we need to visit a physical branch to get our signature registered before the GIRO can workone more thing is .. to confirm — to qualify for the 1% cashback we need to be enrolled into the everyday rewards+ programme  a monthly thing that we have to do  is that correct?,btohqsg
Hi I want to convert sgd 1000 to usd in ibkr. They say need 2k minimum. Is that so?,btohqsg
Looks like there’s no more selecting of Salary in OCBC to send to UOB One account?,btohqsg
Yeah  looks like they removed the option,btohqsg
Then have to just use DBS 🤪,btohqsg
Paynow on web still has it,btohqsg
Hi 👋for salary which is paid via transfer from J.P.MorganIs there has any bank which provides similar benefits like Salary GIRO?Thanks,btohqsg
I don't think that is FAST.,btohqsg
May i knw how long we need to leave the fund S$10k there in order to claim the rewards? as i cannot find in the T&C. Thanks,btohqsg

View ourterms and conditions here.​The free Tesla Inc share will be issued to your account within 5 business days after 90 days of account opening. View ourterms and conditions here.,btohqsg
and can we trade SG E3 for the 5x or 3x trade?,btohqsg
If you mean ES3 for STI ETF  yes,btohqsg
in other words we need to leave our fund inside for 90days is that right?,btohqsg
yes  keep net deposit at least S$10000,btohqsg
If deposit S$10K  but made S$1 withdrawal also cannot (for the TSLA share criteria),btohqsg
what if paper lose in the trade?,btohqsg
As long as no withdrawals are made is fine. Do confirm with CS,btohqsg
How does ur salary credit show up in ur bank account? There are a few common ways to transfer like giro  fast transfer  paynow etc.,btohqsg
Is it true that if you have an existing HSBC credit card with HSBC you can’t open a HSBC Everyday Global Account via online banking.I tried to open the babk account online but it did not allow me to. I called the customer service and the above is what they told me. The staff mention i have to indicate my interest to open the account online and a staff will contact me or I have to head down physically to the bank,btohqsg
If salary is paid via FAST or Paynow  is there any bank that gave extra interest for salary credit? Thanks,btohqsg
Did chocolate finance reduced their rate?Usually get $2.30 - $2.31 per day for 1st $20k but today got $2.15,btohqsg
You need to understand how chocolate finance works for amount >20k. There is a reason people suggesting to keep it 19.5k-19.7k,btohqsg
as in paid from corporate account?,btohqsg
I got $2.29 😂😂I withdraw the amount everyday so it keeps to $20k everyday.I suspect they gave out extra fractional and now clawing back?,btohqsg
Mine is never more than $20k though. Maybe need to keep it $19 900 or so,btohqsg
hitrying to purchase electronic from samsung1.5kI am thinking to use atome  mcc 5999 according to heymaxpossible credit cards for cashback: DBS Livefresh  UOB EVOL  UOB ONE  OCBC FRANKmay I know if this is correct? or any better suggestion?Or is there other better card for 5732 electronics? Physical payment,btohqsg
What cc is the best right now for daily spending,btohqsg
Okay thanks let me check it out,btohqsg
If you like miles  Amaze+CRMC is rarely beaten unless you spend on travel  hospitals and insurance.For cash back  just do UOB One. Avoid hospitals and insurance. As a small bonus  you get added cash back from Grab  Dairy Farm Group and MacDonalds.These two are general spending cards and function on blacklist basis. Least painful to manage.,btohqsg
Looks like the return is not consistent. How come my return is less than 4.2%?,btohqsg
Is standchart journey card having the best promo on singsaver now? How do the rewards compare with previous promos?,btohqsg
I thought only the amount above $20k is not guaranteed? First $20k is guaranteed?Eg. $20010 of saving  $20 000 has guaranteed return.$10 has no guaranteed return.,btohqsg
Actually this is a bit misleading. The first $20k won't be negative  but anything above can be. Which I think will affect the total returns for the day (i.e. daily returns minus capital loss).,btohqsg
The $10 is not only no guaranteed returns  it's no guaranteedcapitalas well. So you're better off making sure you don't exceed $20k.,btohqsg
It’s definitely they are being misleading.A reminder that chocolate finance is an investment and your capital is not guaranteed.,btohqsg
No.. your message is misleading. You're saying if they have above $20k  everything including the $20k can drop. But their t&cs clearly stated that the first $20k in everyone's account will not drop below that  any capital losses/target returns not met will be topped up by CF.,btohqsg
