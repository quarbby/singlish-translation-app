Morning! What's the holding period for UOB Evol? Couldn't find in t&c. Got it only last month but decided to use my lady card instead. Thanks!,btohqsg
As in  any penalty/fee for early cancellation?,btohqsg
I have been strugling to add standard chartered smart visa credit card to samsung pay. It rejects this card while mastercard standard chartered simpli cash credit card or all my uob cards works fine. I got a replacement card and its still same problem. If anyone manage to solve this issue let me know,btohqsg
Tnc doesn't state anything. So safe to say no. But you can always check with cso to confirm.,btohqsg
Is this still valid? Can anyone confirm?,btohqsg
If you got the card with a signup promo (e.g. singsaver) then there might be a holding period in the T&Cs (not just UOB's T&Cs) there as well,btohqsg
Hi all  does the UOB Krisflyer credit card start earning 3mpd as long as the $800 krisflyer merchants is spent within the year? Or after the $800 spend?,btohqsg

just checking if uob absolute amex could be a final way to pay tax or insurance?,btohqsg
Hi just wondered if someone could share. Hospital bills are generally excluded from eligible spend lists. What about private clinic invoices issued from GPs or specialists,btohqsg
dun think can pay tax direct using uob absolute amex  not many insurance accept Amex card also,btohqsg
hospital bill may not be excluded for some banks or if it is public hospital can pay via healthhub.clinics usually not excluded,btohqsg

Is it possible to start option trading between 20 - 50?,btohqsg
No.  20-50 dollars. I've read that people did that before with 35 dollars but that was years ago. I'm not sure if it still applies now?,btohqsg
If i use my uob card to buy incrypto.com(gpay/straight from card) will it count?,btohqsg
Calculate wrong  3.56% p.a. but not far from 3.55% p.a..AIA just released also  min 5k  3.6% p.a.  2 years. EIR 3.66% p.a. after reinvestment of year 1 payout.,btohqsg
Any one knows why the UOB Lady’s card says bonus 6miles extended to 31 Mar? Was it going to end?,btohqsg
if they end the promo  is there other card that is comparable for travel?,btohqsg
Is UOB one account the best choice assuming one with 100k? Salary crediting+ $500 card spend,btohqsg
It's the easiest way to hit 5% if you can do salary credit and $500 card spend. Your salary can be credited from your other bank account as well.,btohqsg
It will become 4mpd  as with every other cards with high mpd.,btohqsg
Yup  using own DBS account and transfer as Salary to my UOB one  account 😂,btohqsg
oh 20-30$  no unfortunately you won’t go far😂  i suggest you demo trade and go work a job  before you start trading,btohqsg

I just open 360 account on 2 Feb and deposit 3K inside  do I need to deposit $500 for this month?,btohqsg
