That's the case for entire rp,btohqsg
Very easy to get C or D but hard go get A or B,btohqsg
idk for science ah but for me  just hand up work and you will get B,btohqsg
Your work needs to be of some quality for that la,btohqsg
lmao i think some of the things ive been mentioning abt rp  kuro may be sceptical,btohqsg
But B average for CA grades not that much difference and it's MSA and ESE that plays the impt role,btohqsg
yea but that one just look at past papers..then just find answers for those..should be getting C for them,btohqsg
I wish i was not born at the equator,btohqsg

Maybe im wrong but poly test are set in a way that even if u fk up  moderation will pull u up,btohqsg
Bell curve make people harder to get A for a easy paper,btohqsg
U get fk if whole class score in the 50 -60 range. Which means your 51 means a c and the 58 is a A,btohqsg
