Hi  anyone use citi payall for NTU school fee yet?,btohqsg
Is shopee/youtrip topup working for you guys?,btohqsg
I did shopee ytd and it works,btohqsg
You have $5 in the Fund now,btohqsg
Just completed the gpay reward with 2 shopee pay top ups,btohqsg
If you have activated Smartsave  it will auto subscribe for you at around 830am everyday. The app will send a push notification to you prior to that (on daily basis too),btohqsg
Hey guys  I just reviewed my credit card statements. I swiped some master/visa payments overseas in hk/th in june/may. (i used instarem amaze + citi premiermiles card) i reviewed the rate and it's around 2.5-3.5% worse than spot fx. i also have 0 IPi think i have misunderstood the online spend strategy.Looks like i'm back to youtrip + whatever topup... i remember getting ~0.5% from spot for most overseas currency.or if anyone has a better strategy  pls share (mainly for visa/master swiping overseas at retail outlets...),btohqsg
When subscribing to moomoo funds or cash plus  will the price fluctuate everyday (leading to lesser or more units for the same price) or it doesnt work this way,btohqsg
Hi J yes everything has gone over to cash plus now,btohqsg
The amount charged to be rewarded IP is $10 and above ~,btohqsg
Got 100+400+ one. All no IPs,btohqsg
Amaze have excluded MCC which follows local credit card.,btohqsg
Merchant category code. Excluded categories could include gov  insurance  prepaid topup  utilities  parking  computer services  vary by card.,btohqsg
Looks like back to using youtrip. Best rates for overseas retail Mastercard/visa in person swiping? I guess lol. Think I burned couple hundred sgd in the bad exchange rate fees cuz I didn't check whether i was getting any IP or evaluating the exchange rate. When I did the calculations (amaze fx charge vs spot fx) it was frigging 2.5-3+% lmao wtf man.,btohqsg
Back to Trust vs Youtrip debate again?,btohqsg
Or Amex KF giving 2x miles 2nd half of the year?,btohqsg
https://www.visa.com.sg/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.htmlThis VISA calculator quite useful. Input 3.25-3.5% bank fee and my actual card bill was within S$1  maybe due to actual charge date. Then compare with bank fee 0%.,btohqsg
Thanks for letting me know about the 830am transfer,btohqsg
Yeah. For a very long time I have been using youtrip for overseas Mastercard/visa retail tapping when I run low on cash. Honestly the rates (0.2-0.5% cost from fx)  sometimes even better than when I change sgd cash-> foreign currency at raffles place. + More convenient.Think hard go find a better alternative.,btohqsg
The main question is here:Q: What merchant did you spend it on?,btohqsg
have to use 4mpd cards with Amaze then it is clear winner over youtrip still.if your underlying card is below 2mpd  then likely Youtrip might be preferable for some (although calculations for amaze still win slightly depending on your mile valuation).,btohqsg
Trust is very trusty (lol) for me when I travel around SEA because SEA is still very cash dependent. So having a card with free ATM withdrawals is essential,btohqsg
i don't actually plan to withdraw la but i got $3.58 cashback from google pay anyway so...,btohqsg
plus i only did $5 $5 top up  thou i'm not rich but $10 is not a huge loss imo,btohqsg
Is ok. Dash can be used to pay PayNow  so you can use at hawker centre etc.,btohqsg
Yesterday shopee pay waived admin fee for withdrawal... Now it's charging me $0.2??,btohqsg
I think can only withdraw once a week for free  maybe try next week,btohqsg
Any idea which credit cards allow u to earn points for making insurance payments?,btohqsg
Luckily i did it all at 1 shot. Thanks for sharing,btohqsg
hi guys I spend like 1k on food panda monthly. what card/payment methods should I use to maximize cashback?,btohqsg
Citi cashback I guess. But you'll save much more if you stop using FoodPanda all the time 😂,btohqsg
eat grass buy eth. thank me in 2025,btohqsg
Which cards have y’all used before in China? Does Trust Bank card work?All three SG bank cards charge 3.25-3.5% for FCX right? Besides Trust  any other cards are accepted in China?,btohqsg
China dont really accept visa/master. Union pay is more acceptable. But mostly use whatchat pay [China version] and alipay [China version],btohqsg
Hey guys so what is the best way for me to participate in the UOB national day savings? I should make a transfer from UOB to my DBS account on 29 or 30 Aug. then 1st Sept deposit it back?,btohqsg
Until it is not when the overseas atm did not dispense the money and account is debited. This happened to me in JKT last week and now waiting for Trust to sort it out with Mandiri. Told me it will take up to 3 months. lol,btohqsg
The current National Day Savings promo with the Bonuses announced run till 30th september and is based on your DAY END balance as at 30th June 2023 (ACROSS ALL UOB ACCOUNTS).My suggestion is if you want to PUNT on the possibility of the next National Day Savings promo is for you to withdraw your money from your 'target participating account' (e.g. UOB One account) on 30th september. And you hope that in October  they announce a new promo referencing your DAY END balance as at 30th september.My personal feel is with the current interest rate sentiment  UOB might not run another promo or even if they do  the bonus might not be as attractive.,btohqsg
So fast executed after announce. Thanks for the news,btohqsg
Does anyone has experience investing in SME capital holding?,btohqsg
Yesterday I just received my OCBC 360 interest.... I'm quite satisfiedBack then I just put my money on DBS only to earn interest of $0.55 but now it is much more..... Only came to know about high interest savings  accounts through this channel and Chris Videos.... Thank you bro!,btohqsg
am trying to open uob one account online now  but stuck after the retrieve myinfo. anyone did the same today and encounter the same issue?,btohqsg
Hi just want check my uob one acc application just got approved. But I didn’t receive any tmrw acc to login. What Shd I do ?,btohqsg
wait for credit card to physically arrive first,btohqsg
Oh the email didn’t mention mall me anything too,btohqsg
Hi I want to ask how long does it inbetween UOB physical credit card and the pin ? Cause I don’t have a UOB TMRW  only have their credit card currently,btohqsg
They dun send u your TMRW account??,btohqsg
They ask me enter PIN number for my credit card ? Which I do not have or arrived yet 😅 other banks use singpass to open but UOB ibanking like a bit more troublesome,btohqsg
Hmmm I haven’t gotten mine. So I can’t advise. Maybe u can advise me once I got mine. :),btohqsg
