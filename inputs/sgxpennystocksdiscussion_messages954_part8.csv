ASL insiders recently converted quite a chunk of $0.060 warrants amounting to $millions of their own money into the company.Whenever insiders willing to put own money into their company  it’s always good to put more attention to them since they are risking more money  you can expect them to hustle harder too  IMO.TA  yesterday T4/T5 contra players  did not lose and price is now above the downtrend pressure line.ASL should be a good longer term pick  especially for those who can hold. The potential is there and the industry they are in is doing well oversell.Currently  it is trading cheaper than what the insiders have paid for the conversion.Added more $0.058 yesterday too at close.
