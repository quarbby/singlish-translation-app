Coinhako/moomoo for a start cause it is user friendly and eliminates alot of memecoins and alts so that you dont jump the gun and go straight to gambling.Once you get the hang of it gemini/coinbase/ kraken are some of the popular ones. Pls DYOR and DD before entering the crypto world. Not everyone can stomach its volatility.,btohqsg
I just learnt from the standard chartered bank hotline that the bank is not waiving their credit card annual fees for this year.,btohqsg
Use cash to invest In what?,btohqsg
This is investment advice which nobody is allowed by law to give you here.Talk to a licence professional for ideas but try to execute them yourself for lower fees.,btohqsg
Yes this is something which I have been warning about.But I won’t say it’s impossible to waive annual fees. Just take note scb isn’t like last time anymore where annual fees can be waived most of the time. Now it’s like some of the time. Need justification and “fighting”. May not succeed.,btohqsg
How is Instarem different from YouTrip?,btohqsg

Just to add on Amaze Wallet = Debit card giving you good FX rates 😂,btohqsg

my trust cashback is Dining category,btohqsg
and you don't bluff me ah..i know SCB Smart super nerfed liao.. high min spend with very specific merchants only,btohqsg
Still 10% until end March i think,btohqsg
I want to cancel but have to wait for my bonus to come,btohqsg

why even need email? SMS got say mah,btohqsg
Scared la. Later they said account 1 eligible  account 2 not eligible.,btohqsg
keep accounts separate better.. don't do joint...  going forward quite leh cheh,btohqsg
you register both single and joint... february how u musical chair???,btohqsg
Million dollar question....1 Feb go PS HSBC Branch 😂So far every month just alternating. But T&C getting conflicted.,btohqsg
it is very clear.. if you registerMr Rich... Mr Rich Single and Mr Rich / Mrs Rich joint accountboth gets registered into January 2025 promo.. both with benchmark December 2024.,btohqsg
Means next month still got chance in February.After this BTL.Then GG liao...,btohqsg
But does it matter which month you registered? As long as you are registered?,btohqsg
The month you registered will determine the benchmark month loh.. which for BTL isDecemberOctober 2024.So whichever account held the Cash inDecemberOctober 2024  cannot hold the cash also in January 2025.,btohqsg
sorry you are right.. yes October. i will amend,btohqsg
I need more time to think...Haiz... money hard to earn... 🥲Maybe need to ping pong with esaver soon liao.,btohqsg
so February 2025... let's say new promo comes out.. whether one month or 2 months.. what are you going to do?,btohqsg
if i were you.. quickly go open a SINGLE account with another human nowbecause likely February promo will refer to January ADB as reference...,btohqsg
Say now in Account 2  Oct 24 reference.Then Feb EGA  register promo  Jan 25 reference  topup money Account 1.Then March EGA  register promo  overlapped  Wah.. how? lol,btohqsg
Can 9 year old open EGA? 😂,btohqsg
I think as long as they launch a brand new promo which requires the INITIAL REGISTRATION.. single + joint will kenna liao,btohqsg
you use either your parents or wife parents lathey don't use HSBC right.,btohqsg
Hmmm... need to sit down with RM to think of strategy liao...,btohqsg
why u cannot open 2 single accounts in total? i don't get this...,btohqsg
Too many liao. lol. But it's possible. Just more harder to control now.Means also can cancel all the joint accounts liao going forward.,btohqsg
yes.. i am using 4 humans total 4 single accounts..much more straightforward,btohqsg
So the 1% EGA cannot use joint acc as a separate 1% bucket in future? Still can till it can’t work right? 😬,btohqsg
1% is use ownself as incremental month on month benchmark... no issuethe big one we all care about is the 2.x% leh,btohqsg
