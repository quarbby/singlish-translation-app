i also need consider alot more stuff if its a public area,btohqsg
Better idea. Those coming put name down. If attendance have then pte group,btohqsg
I always go meets no whr park sia,btohqsg

I won't do auto lah.. no power sia..,btohqsg
I got drive Redmart part time  before..,btohqsg
look ah i be honest cfm the channel rn cfm got TP inside,btohqsg
thats why if i were to host ltr i want to jst not get into trouble,btohqsg
idk la obv got 2.7k members,btohqsg

No dude if I going buy I either get Tesla or hummer ev,btohqsg
Dun want you kena risk of burning down..,btohqsg
The Tesla I get only for driving to work and back not for racing,btohqsg
Yup not in yet but estimate price at 370k full all in,btohqsg
Tesla a bit more fire risky than Kona..,btohqsg
Kona design abit crap to me,btohqsg
Kona Cheaper and cheaper to run.,btohqsg
You want design or just go to and from work?!,btohqsg
Cos I tall asf very hard fit in Kona I sat before damn cramped,btohqsg
Bring down the seat before you get in lah..,btohqsg
And the back lights ugly sia. To me uh to others maybe nice,btohqsg
Then get Ioniq. At least it won't try to burn you down..,btohqsg
Nvm imma get a hummer ev suv haha cfm can fit plus more space and more distance per full charge,btohqsg
Can hope but won't come so soon..,btohqsg
This one I can consider ioniq 5 quite ok,btohqsg

I went for my checkup when I was 17 then delayed until 18 then they ask me go see psychiatrist. Then psychiatrist downgrade me all the way. Excused physical activity and excused firearm handling. Other than BMT training I cannot touch firearms.,btohqsg
If gtr electric comes out I cfm buyüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
MG might be a good option,btohqsg
