For HSBC revolution card  am I eligible for the cashback if I purchase items from Shopee?,btohqsg
Hi all  planning to switch over to UOB one for salary crediting from OCBC 360. My salary will credit on the 11th of each month. When is a good time for me to switch over so I still get max interest from ocbc and Uob?,btohqsg
why not use citi cash back for 6% dinning   8% groceries and petrol? The rest use UOB Evol(to hit the uob one 5% for 100k),btohqsg
Cause my monthly spend to low to constantly hitting min  once in awhile I have large expenses but usually it below $600. Hence why I have a secondary card just in casePlus I donâ€™t bank with UOB hence wasnâ€™t looking at UOB cards ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
You can try to do your own FAST transfer to UOB ONE account  and tag your purpose of transfer as: SALARY. Based on my own testing from DBS to UOB ONE  it works.,btohqsg
my strategy is dinning  groceries  petrol all use citi cash back max out the $80 rebate  excess use UOB one to pay for utilities like sp services  senoko  mrt  etc. Wonder if anyone has a better alternative? I am thinking of switching to uob evol but it doesnt give any rebate for utilities and the min is $600 hmm,btohqsg
Hi all  can the DBS Altitude Amex card be added to Google Pay wallet?,btohqsg
i think best strat still which you can maximised easily monthly,btohqsg
wah means can use both ocbc 360 and uob one liao,btohqsg
but you might cause some tax implication idk how it really work,btohqsg
opps it seem like it not working https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT206638,btohqsg
if uob one no need to credit salary can just fast means can use ocbc 360 get the 4.05% pa and UOB One for the 5%,btohqsg
i read somewhere doing FAST with Salary tag might cause some tax implication idk how true is that,btohqsg
What tax implications? We pay tax to IRAS based on IR8E and we are transferring between our own account.,btohqsg
Just transfer the min $1600 lo,btohqsg
i think if send to partner account might affect ?,btohqsg
no need to hold so much liquid cash. If dont want ocbc 360 can just put in rhb 4.1% fix d for 2 years,btohqsg
If too many ppl do this UOB gonna patch it soon,btohqsg
The bottomline is that we are doing this is not to runaway from tax. Even if IRAS is asking  show it lo. What to be afraid of.,btohqsg
Yes.. May be NERFED too.  Enjoy while you can.. Lol,btohqsg
if you meant if manual bill payment to credit card is considered giro bill payment then it is not.,btohqsg
NFA  but if you pay yourself salary  technically it works as a tax-deductible business cost to you and a revenue to you (taxable). Hence net 0.,btohqsg
Hi guys  what do you guys use for paying income taxes?,btohqsg
for the hsbc revo  can i buy gold bar to meet the requirement? do i get 4x miles from it?,btohqsg
do take note that gold bullion shops typically add a surcharge if you pay by CC,btohqsg
idk the MCC for bullion shops,btohqsg
Anyway just to share  if anyone using credit card directly overseas or for foreign currency online  visa exchange rate is way worst then mastercard by it self. I text with 2 different card from ocbc  1 visa and 1 master,btohqsg
Update on this  use this link instead:https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/cards/credit-card.page,btohqsg
I spend ard 1.4k aud online on both card  visa charge 45 dollar more sgd,btohqsg
Oh no Excluding Amazon andMustafa for 10x points soon,btohqsg
If the mcc fall under 5411 grocery,btohqsg
Other terminal within those should not be affected,btohqsg
Actually where to find the terms and conditions on what are the excluded transactions for the cashback ah ?,btohqsg
Bigpay cashback given in the cashback rewards. I canâ€™t find the terms and conditions on what are the excluded mcc le,btohqsg
visa is bigger than mastercard so it has the guts to charge more.,btohqsg
That's why I make it a point to try to use MasterCard as much as I can.Visa  I wonder why they have 2x the market share of MasterCard?,btohqsg
I also wonder though I like visa more,btohqsg
MC has Amaze. And even without Amaze  there are competitive MC products.DBS WWMC  OCBC TR  Citi Rewards. Literally three of the Four Heavenly Kings.,btohqsg
And before they start charging more fees than MC,btohqsg
yes  im pretty sure the place will accept mc if it accept visa. we should use mc more in case visa become monopoly,btohqsg
If need 2-3 more MCs to complete the Amazing experience  it will be UOB KF and Maybank FnF. Maybe Citi Prestige if you have that.,btohqsg
Visa has Trust Card (will try to avoid that)  EVOL/Frank/Live Fresh  HSBC Revolution... Much as I don't like Visa it will be hard to put down any of the Triplets.,btohqsg
only specific merchants listed in the app has cashback,btohqsg
trust card can be used for oversea withdraw  amaze paypass can cover other payment.,btohqsg
I got this $50Awarded to me but I donâ€™t know how to get it out ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Visa usually have better reward program  u will notice most cashback card is visa,btohqsg
yes and visa card is more than mastercard.,btohqsg
Guess for local currency can use visa and then mastercard for foreign currency spending,btohqsg
yes ha. i think youtrip has best rate in multi currency wallet maybe because it is a mastercard,btohqsg
yes  actually applied last year it is already visa.,btohqsg
