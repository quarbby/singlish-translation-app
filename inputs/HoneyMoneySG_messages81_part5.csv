ok. meaning I can continue to top up my RA beyond FRS and can still make withdrawal any fund above FRS before it totally convert to CPF Life at age 65?,btohqsg
I think we still can VC3A else for those above 55 and still working all thier contributions have to go to RA.,btohqsg
Wrong..at 55  when you work  your contributions are still going to split among OA  SA  MÀ.,btohqsg
If you top up RA  you can only top up to ERS. Assuming your FRS is 198 800 at age 55  assume it reaches 300k at age 65  this whole amount will be used to buy CPF life annuity plan assuming you choose the standard plan.,btohqsg
This will give you a monthly payout of approximately 1600,btohqsg
ok  My qns is if you hit ERS before 65  can you withdrawal  to left FRS for your CPF Life plan before 65.If I want only FRS for CPF Life.,btohqsg
I think one can VC to 3A as self-employed above 55.,btohqsg
Don’t think so because after FRS  only can top up RA,btohqsg
so we can have better interest rate on OA/SA than RA for the first 60k.,btohqsg
Once you reach 55  when you login CPF  you will know you can’t top up other than RA,btohqsg
Self-employed is as good as a working employee for both above 55.,btohqsg
Assuming VC3A is ok. The problem is still the cobtribution ratio  OA is higher than SA for below 61 or 55-60.,btohqsg
Top up is not subject to tax. If you contribute Cpf like an employee  you are subject to tax,btohqsg
if your tax bracket is low not significant.,btohqsg
also  is VC subject to tax?,btohqsg
The purpose of VC is to reduce tax bracket,btohqsg
This article may clarify your questions more accurately.https://endowus.com/insights/manage-cpf-retirement-before-55#cpf-withdrawal-at-age-55Based on the article  VC3A will split accordingly to what you mentioned  based on contribution ratio. Any contributions to OA/SA after RA is formed (hitting FRS) can be withdrawn at any time. Anything contributed into RA (top-ups to RA or MA that already hit BHS) will go towards CPF life.And like what Andy mentioned  top-ups to RA and VC3A will not benefit from tax relief.,btohqsg
The Fed’s remarkable featThe US central bank has managed to humble hawkish and dovish critics alike.https://bt.sg/S5ou,btohqsg
when is the best time to top up to MA? Will it depend on your monthly income?,btohqsg
usually first few days of the year when limit has been raised but employer contribution not in yet,btohqsg
oh is it different from topping up towards the end of the year?,btohqsg
If SA less than 40k  transfer OA to SA for 5.08% interest rate. Magic number OA 20k + SA 40k = 60k combined balance for 1% additional interest. No tax reliefs.If SA more than 40k  MA haven't hit BHS  VCMA 8k (or till BHS  whichever lower). Will benefit from tax relief. If MA hits BHS  additional MA contributions will overflow to SA.If SA more than 40k  MA hit BHS  RSTU 8k (or till SA hit FRS). Will also benefit from tax relief. Any RSTU amount will bereserved. If SA hits FRS  additional SA contributions will overflow to OA.BHS increases yearly on Jan 1  best time to VCMA is before CPF contributions so that more will flow into SA without reserving. Can also top-up after paying premiums for Hospitalisation and Careshield plans.Tax relief from self top-up is up to 8k (VCMA + RSTU). Also can get tax relief from loved ones top-up  up to 8k. Tax relief is by calendar year.More in-depth can be found on this video by Chris:https://youtu.be/sLG97H6Rap4?si=qH6SDhHYB4hfER_0,btohqsg
@magimagsjust nice. Can refer to this.,btohqsg
thanks! But i guess if i'm in need of OA money for housing  then better to top up MA?,btohqsg
This video by Chris should help you with deciding on topping up for tax relief or transferring OA to SA:https://youtu.be/sLG97H6Rap4?si=_1-eWP1Wx68nKByk,btohqsg

Seems that a handful of experts here had mentioned 29 Dec to empty UOB one acct to anticipate for CNY promo (if there is one),btohqsg
Do you mean empty to zero balance?,btohqsg
Why not empty on 30th December (a Saturday) instead?,btohqsg
