Hi experts. I am heading to australia (perth) in 2 weeks time. Im looking to bring arnd 2k aud cash (i need cash for some activities)What is the best way i can withdraw and get the best rate with lowest/no fees?,btohqsg
Anyone has any issue with zym connection for past 1 hr,btohqsg
If you absolutely need to withdraw AUD overseas  with no fees and minimal markup:1. YouTrip - up to SGD400/FX equivalent per month2. Revolut - up to SGD350/FX equivalent per month  no fees on weekdays3. Trust Bank - no locking in of exchange rates,btohqsg
May I ask for t bills when it mature does the money get credit back to the bank account on where its purchased? Thanns,btohqsg
Oh It seems wise card is not in the recommendation list at all,btohqsg
Go to your uob mobile app  and enter accounts  details  you should see your mas number,btohqsg
You missed out the portion on tapping on the latest bonus interest history,btohqsg
Then Heymax shows which card if you scroll down.,btohqsg
actual mcc for his transaction is mcc 7011,btohqsg
No. It goes back to the bank account tied to your CDP account,btohqsg
Seems like it's merchant on wrong code tho. 7011 is typically lodging üëÄUnless... It's for booking of clubhouse?,btohqsg
Mean the transaction is D‚Äôresort but not NTUC Club? CRMC exclude 7011,btohqsg
What did you actually spend on?,btohqsg
I suppose booking d'resort under ntuc club charges it as 7011 still... Means ntuc club is just too generic a merchant?,btohqsg
Unfortunately heymax leads dresort to ntuc club also. But it's highly likely to be 7011 the moment it's resort booking already.,btohqsg
Have anyone credited the heymax miles earned to their frequent flyer programs before?,btohqsg
I don't see my latest points in Heymax from mytrip.comtransaction. Do I have to click into heymax first everytime i do a transaction?,btohqsg
Did you click shop with max from the app? For flight booking  is your flight confirmed and e-tickets issued?,btohqsg
No I didn't click into the heymax app first ;( i forgot hahaBut a previous transaction i also forgot to click into heymax app  but i got a notification for heymax saying my points went in,btohqsg
so not sure if i'm supposed to click everytime or not? it was a hotel booking and I got the confirmation email already,btohqsg
Just got my Citi rewards card last month with first spend being 12 April  just wondering if anyone knows when the statement is usually issued after first use.,btohqsg
Hi can I check if anyone subscribed to Singtel 10gbps internet? I‚Äôm thinking of changing my 2gbps to 10gbps with just a top up of $10/month on Singtel.I know it‚Äôs not related but I can‚Äôt find a channel to ask if Singtel 10 gbps is reliable n the uptime for it,btohqsg
It rolls around from your statement date. If you got it recently  your statement date is likely 20th of the month. So txns from 12-20 will count in that.,btohqsg
Same but I might hold up up for a few months to stable,btohqsg
statement date can be any date. Can check with citibank which date it is,btohqsg
Thank you. Finally managed to speak with someone at Citi and found out the statement was aligned with my other credit card.,btohqsg
Bruh‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Of course that won‚Äôt be groceries,btohqsg
I'm sorry guys  I need your advice relating to UOB One interest cut. So currently it is 5% on a 100k. But next month.. it is going to be 4% right? As for the other two tiers of 125k & 150k.. does they make a difference?  Like..  what is the best possible amount to fully take advantage of UOB interest..,btohqsg
4% is based on 150k. 100k is less than that.,btohqsg
Oh. So 150k should be the best way ?,btohqsg
Best possible amt is 150k for 4%,btohqsg
Amaze is the correct oneHeymax is not always correct,btohqsg
Thank you bro. I'll go for that,btohqsg
And the rest dump into moomoo cash plus?,btohqsg
Didnt know that for same merchant name (ntuc club) you can have different mcc based on what purchase üò•,btohqsg
Anyone has any altcoin in mind to trade ?,btohqsg
More accurate with amaze empty wallet,btohqsg
Same merchant name can have more than one mcc.Even the same shop. Visa and master mcc could be different.,btohqsg
How to find out what is the avg daily balance for uob one acc for month of march?,btohqsg

Hi I use amaze card with UOB Lady for booking traveloka. Will i get 4 miles points?,btohqsg
Wondering if anyone here has used cardup on a Citi cash back+ card? Cashback ok with this mcc?,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone tried applying for citi rewards again after they cancelled the card before? I cancelled mine last year in aug/sept and was wondering if I could reapply and get it,btohqsg
You can check on cardup's website for a list of eligible cards,btohqsg
