And be like â€˜and what u want to do w ur portfolioâ€™,btohqsg
I regretted choosing my pipa back then in sec sch cause the åŸºæœ¬åŠŸ is not smth that can be easily mastered just within the span of 3-4 years,btohqsg
I dk how i didnt make it to CO,btohqsg
Maybe coz it was my 3rd choice,btohqsg
Things were complicated (i cant rmb what was my 2nd  but shooting was my 1st),btohqsg
Wasn't there some CCA trial and shortlisting process,btohqsg
But i didnt go to shooting trials,btohqsg

No actually the shooting teacher told us they took in some ppl out of pity (coz got into none of the choices),btohqsg
And i never excelled in it,btohqsg
I actually was fr nusco (percussion) coz stupid wind symphony has sun night practices,btohqsg
