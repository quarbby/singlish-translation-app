thanks for your valuable share bro! will take note,btohqsg
But I cannot DO this on Fsm... Sibei strict on FSM,btohqsg
i'm using poems. not sure if my broker will be strict bo,btohqsg
This trick can only do if u have a good rapport with ur dealer/remisier,btohqsg
If not they find it too mafan to amend for u,btohqsg
I also poems no issues with my broker he happy I buy sell everytime I say sorry to trouble u... He say no need sorry I understand whyðŸ¤£,btohqsg
But really brokerage on poems Damm high compared to Fsm... Of course fsm u need cash upfront,btohqsg
Agree. Dun play fire by using retirement fund for penny stocks,btohqsg
But if you generated additional profit from earlier stock investment which doesnâ€™t affect your retirement  can try play a bit with penny stock using your profit only. Who knows may become the next AEM or Medtech ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
The thing I love about fsm is that I can never be confused I just click my portfolio and all my holdings are there no Chance of making mistake by over selling like on poems sometimes I buy sell buy sell until see stars I forget what I have... Old already need to upgrade my cpuðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

Just don't buy at the high otherwise gong gongðŸ‘€ðŸ™ƒðŸ¥¶,btohqsg
Gtr88 i can understand your pain  i'm not able to see my holdings bought using cpf  i only can rely on their e-statement,btohqsg
My holding bank is DBS for cpf trading no issues I log in to DBS Internet banking and All my holdings is listed there,btohqsg
But in summary my luck is that I have lost more from cpf than I have thru cash.... Anyway overall still gain so I guess is okðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Mine is green so far...coz I use CPF for stocks like Wilmar and YZJ...stable stock/business with stable dividend,btohqsg
Gtr88 okie okie. all the best bro!,btohqsg
previously on ifast... but backside itchy go sold it and buy hosen,btohqsg
My Personal experience is that I can sell my cpf shares today and buy again tommorow using same funds that I sold with.... BUT DO NO QUOTE ME ON THIS I AM NOT SURE IF ITS SAME with other custodian banks I use poems to buy sell and DBS is my holding bank... I REPEAT please check yourself with your broker and holding bank whether its the same.... I DO NOT WISH TO BE LIABLE FOR ANY screw ups thanks ðŸ’ªðŸ’ªðŸ’ª,btohqsg
Gtr88 noted. mine also dbs/posb as my holding bank,btohqsg

While many people had made lots of money from GameStop. I was the few unlucky ones who bought near the peak. Long story short.. I invested my NS savings plus tuition fee into GameStop. Right now  I am losing more then 60% of that amount.. All I can do now  is to stare at the bloody red screen and pray for a miracle. Never felt so hopeless in my life before..-#94802:https://www.nuswhispers.com/confession/94802,btohqsg
Yup. What was i even thinking. Haha,btohqsg
Ppl buy to support. He buy to huat.,btohqsg

But usd going to breakout also  might see a sharp switch to risk off assets,btohqsg
hmm for the short time yes,btohqsg
Slv is a joke.. party died fast as expected,btohqsg
