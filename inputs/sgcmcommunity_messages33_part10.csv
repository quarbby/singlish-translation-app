I always go Buddha n Taoist temple. Weekday noon very few ppl 1 la. We sit outside n enjoy tea sessions,btohqsg
Then got 3 buffet style meals a day,btohqsg
I think I give quite bit to those meals.,btohqsg
Sound like geylang. Got free meals,btohqsg
The only free meals I think I get is from my parents.,btohqsg
The LTA in this group be like ðŸ¤¨ðŸ“¸,btohqsg
TP not LTA. LTA come after you if you donâ€™t go pay for usage.,btohqsg
Think he mistaken it as speeding.,btohqsg
Last time when I was a kid  one sedan car can accommodate 10 paxâ€¦,btohqsg
Accelerating is not speeding if one do not understand,btohqsg
Same for me too.We just sat on top of parent's lap. So technically backrow seat can take 6 pax. haha,btohqsg
u floor ur car for 4 seconds how fast will u go,btohqsg
So far only floor at most 2 second ba haha,btohqsg
Sit alternate  some sit back  some sit at the edge  some sit on lap  some sit on floor,btohqsg
U see ppl drive past me with amusement,btohqsg
u are public enemy number 1,btohqsg
cut already then drive sibei slow,btohqsg
then thats not hogging  please block more ppl,btohqsg
If I dont floor I cannot go up this stretch of road fast enough without getting horn by others leh.,btohqsg
Even I gave way to them they will still stuck behind lorry,btohqsg
Lorries are fast I have to say,btohqsg
Some time ppl tail gate me,btohqsg
i saw hiace drive 130 tht day leh,btohqsg
I give way then I go behind them see them been block by lorry,btohqsg
There is this thing I observed in recent years where cars are scared to drive past trunks. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
you have issues  but good issues,btohqsg
I enjoy ppl tail gate lorry,btohqsg
Some match the speed of the trucks at 70kmh on expressways lane 1 when these trucks are at lane 2. Why?,btohqsg
Lol as long as on the left  other drivers shouldn't horn you la,btohqsg
To block u they feel happy,btohqsg
I tried la. 3rd gear  floor. Still can gain speed. Not that bad lol,btohqsg
They dun pay for the petrol lol...,btohqsg
Too many truck drivers dun take extra care,btohqsg
I like to see those ppl drive very aggressive and tail gate ppl,btohqsg
I wonder why they just canâ€™t over take,btohqsg
So all lanes slow down unnecessary.,btohqsg
And then we lame some trucks speeding above 70kmh. The key is they donâ€™t leave enough gaps,btohqsg
I would zoom past or stay out of their blind spot...quite scary cos according to my uncle these drivers either totally can't see the blindspot (otherwise won't call blindspot lol) or they boh hew,btohqsg
They boh hew is one common sign,btohqsg
the key to getting to places fast is buy an R15,btohqsg
Ninjavan livery also add horse power.,btohqsg
Donâ€™t bother to compete with them.,btohqsg
But they must know they cannot have all the excuse to rush,btohqsg
Their platform made them to do it at times.,btohqsg
ridiculous expectations from robot customer service,btohqsg
Cause robot is efficient without the need for human touch,btohqsg
Cleaned throttle body and air flow sensor,btohqsg
Sorry  I take back my previous line....I realized I am insulting robot by saying that.,btohqsg
Robot can take in any insult. The worst is they just stop working and let the higher level deal with the complaints,btohqsg
"was actually want to refer the ""human"" customer service is worst than speaking to a bot. ðŸ¤£",btohqsg
