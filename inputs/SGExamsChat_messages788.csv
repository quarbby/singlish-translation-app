Heavy rain everybody call in loa 🤣 or become late,btohqsg

Is this a group for a levels,btohqsg
"Penalties for dangerous driving in Singapore are ""adequate"" and will not be raised for now  says the government.Minister of State for Home Affairs Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim said this in response to MP questions about road safety after 2 people died in an accident in Tampines:https://cna.asia/4dqWnNx",btohqsg
After the tampines accident  my dad now slow down before each jx in case got any idiot dun obey red light,btohqsg
Yo wtf got explosive ordinance disposal van at rp,btohqsg

Whats the minimum to get D for a mod ah,btohqsg
up to the prof to decide,btohqsg
It was pretty damn bad for me,btohqsg
Like so bad that i think im gonna remod,btohqsg
Idk i just blanked when i saw all the questions fr  i couldnt solve or write anything remotely concrete,btohqsg
well it’s over now so just see when results come out,btohqsg
Dont even think i can get 10/100 sia,btohqsg
is also because the red light cameras also function as speed cameras now,btohqsg
U can opt to remod? I tot it will still be counted. But can it br SU-ed,btohqsg
As in i will fail and theb remod,btohqsg
But can this mod be SU-ed?,btohqsg
if he could su I think he wldve su a long time ago,btohqsg
Oh SU in ntu is prior to the exam ah,btohqsg

You got an SIT offer?And it depends on what course was it and whether you can see yourself doing that field in the future,btohqsg
Tbh i would rather this then getting a D and CAP screwd up,btohqsg

Oh wah i didnt know got fixed plan,btohqsg

but i really dont care anymore,btohqsg
but my intern pay not going up,btohqsg
But anyway on the brighter side  y2s2 is finally over for u,btohqsg
Erm depends on various factors  i think it is btr for you to decide for yourself,btohqsg
how about you lay out the factors you have in your mind for both options,btohqsg
if not we're just gna spout bs,btohqsg
According to my degree audit.. yes,btohqsg
lunch is making me want to fall asleep,btohqsg

Im panicking…im officially in singapore’s unemployment data,btohqsg
Congratulations of being part of this selective group,btohqsg
unemployment is not a bad thing,btohqsg
be willing and able to work and not being able to find work,btohqsg
2.1% is how competitive that is,btohqsg
lol 2.1% of singapore's workforce is still a large amount,btohqsg
2.1% is actually damn low for workforce and kinda signals full employment lmao,btohqsg
SIM:Pros:1. Faster?2. Might have a friend there3. Only realistic local optionCons:1. Lower starting salary based on statistics2. Network just isn't greatJP uni:Pros:1. Japan's uni admissions system means that I effectively come in with a fresh record2. More options for uni courses3. Some part of me wants to move to Japan anyway  and I doubt it'll be possible with a non-JP lesser known uni degreeCons:1. RN I'm at high N4 to low N3 level in Japanese2. It also means moving alone to Japan,btohqsg
That unemployment rate reflects cyclical unemployment,btohqsg
So would you contribution to this company?Idk I just sit there watch movie,btohqsg
It dos not reflect structural and frictional unemployment,btohqsg
If include these  it will be higher,btohqsg
so what do you think based on this,btohqsg
Yeah I did labour history.. thing tho is we have little regulations for unemployment benefits,btohqsg
Which is probably why our rate is so low,btohqsg
I'm undecided as of now. Do you think I could get into a better tier of uni compared to the tier of uni that SIM usually partners with in Japan?,btohqsg
have you considered a work study diploma?,btohqsg
idk anything about private uni unfortunately,btohqsg
I was considering University of Wollongong degrees offered through SIM,btohqsg
Did u complete the EJU for Japan ?,btohqsg
Anyone has recommendations for test prep tuition?,btohqsg
Yeah... that's because its notorious for being difficult,btohqsg
By US standards  sure. By SG standards?,btohqsg
My math lecturer/tutor bought everything in his home that needs to be charged to charge them in school 💀,btohqsg
As in the kind of connections I'd make probably wouldn't be good,btohqsg
Top Players1. 😁😁😁 Zhao Wei Lam 😃😃😃 –1092. Shiun Shiun –104,btohqsg
More in terms of the opportunities I'd get through my friends,btohqsg
I'm moving to Japan when I'm 18,btohqsg
The real game is my life for I have been played my entire life.,btohqsg
Coping means moving forward despite knowing U got played your whole life,btohqsg
Oh my god... The burger... It's people!,btohqsg
fuck scalpers  tho i wld have done the same,btohqsg
Oh yea carou got a reply quota 💀,btohqsg
I saw two insta stories yesterday. One was 2k queue the other was 23k queue,btohqsg
Yep they implemented in Dec 2023,btohqsg
means like max msgs per day?,btohqsg
wats the capacity of the venue,btohqsg
Now every normal carou seller can only interact with a quota of 20 per month. new people or reccuring people  exceeding 3 months will add to the quota,btohqsg
Max new buyers you can interact with is 20 per month,btohqsg
Carou listing quota per month also dropped from 90 to 30,btohqsg
This means in one month  you can only list or activate 30 new listings,btohqsg
Carou now pushing people to pay more money,btohqsg
Every caroseller Luo Buo Ler be like,btohqsg
Cause they want people to pay more,btohqsg
wonder how does carou even stay afloat/be profitable,btohqsg
is it like stadium there or smth,btohqsg

tbh i still dk who that is,btohqsg
At least none I have been too,btohqsg

I was looking forward to taking a huge ass nap after a bad fking paper,btohqsg
like alot of ppl just sat outside the stadium mrt to listen,btohqsg
maybe they want play it safe,btohqsg
Na it's still indoor just w/o aircon.,btohqsg
It's a business  they want more money lorh,btohqsg
a non sold out venue is bad,btohqsg
dont rly see how make more money tbh,btohqsg
isnt there like a huge hole at the top,btohqsg
It's only the hole at the side cannot,btohqsg
But that one simple fix just don't sell those,btohqsg
More ppl have to buy their packages to sell more especially online businesses,btohqsg
Hey the corporate reasoning is great,btohqsg
Until you see things like this 🤣,btohqsg

Can I ask what are ur reasons,btohqsg
How does friends give you job opportunities?,btohqsg
May I know where the discord is at?,btohqsg

this chat actly became kinda quiet ngl,btohqsg
The difference in chat speed 😂 between our chat grp and this,btohqsg
The ambulance went off the road?,btohqsg
Prob tried to make a turn,btohqsg
Japan's uni admissions run on an EJU + entrance exam system  while the rest of the world uses something closer to US or UK admissions  and honestly  I don't think I'm considered a good enough candidate under the standard uni apps system,btohqsg
The problem is although you can take the EJU in SG  no one offers an EJU prep program here,btohqsg
Jiayous (or why not extend ur term),btohqsg
I not even in hall anymore next sem,btohqsg
Walao I wanna change hall so i can experience Irwen as pres,btohqsg
Irwen was the best pres ever,btohqsg
Will u still be there for me?,btohqsg
I aint even seen my tama pres once but i saw irwen multiple times,btohqsg
I got placing at h7 already,btohqsg
Ok so hall 7 I try to get assigned that,btohqsg
do yall think a sap sch wld be less attractive for non chinese,btohqsg
I see Tama pres every week,btohqsg
How about i change uni to experience irwen as pres,btohqsg
I was hall ghost in tama,btohqsg
My room was actually so good at tama fr,btohqsg
Next to the toilet and 5 steps away from the pantry,btohqsg
I think sap sch are generally more chinesy,btohqsg
I heard assembly in chinese (???),btohqsg
Why we wanna experience your presidency,btohqsg
Irwen said next yr he not staying in hall,btohqsg
can be pres of smth else,btohqsg
Coz we know he is a solid pres,btohqsg
at least my sap primary school had that on alternate days,btohqsg
Maybe ask him to transfer to NUS,btohqsg
There is a sap primary sch???,btohqsg
Yea that seemed to be a better idea,btohqsg
But actually i will not be in nus next yr💀,btohqsg
Means every student forced to take hmt?,btohqsg
I didnt know it existed in pri level,btohqsg
It's the one with a swastika,btohqsg
Does it mean every upper primary student needs to take hmt?,btohqsg
lower primary had to  upper primary could choose,btohqsg
Wah that is good  my classmate also exempted coz chinese dyslexia,btohqsg
Wait there is a hcl for lower primary?,btohqsg
could anyone give reasons why i shld not go to aerospace engineering in NTU?,btohqsg
Maybe i should hv gone there to improve my chinese and maybe get a shot at hcl in o lvl,btohqsg
anyone also planning on taking the Examination For Japanese University Admission? can't seem to find prep courses in SG  so looking for potential study buddies,btohqsg
Just go with ur passion. Why u dun do sth cannot be coz others said it is bad,btohqsg
Coz they are not responsible for ur choices and omo u are the one that is going through it,btohqsg
erm i can go com eng in NUS or NTU,btohqsg
but i chose aerospace coz of my passion for planes,btohqsg
and what do you want to do after uni,btohqsg
At the same time some of it maybe solid advice  it depends on what is their basis to make those stuff and also whether those are facts  opinions or what,btohqsg
you'd think that with SG's tuition industry  there'd be at least one EJU prep course available  but no!,btohqsg
dk if my friend is trolling or being fr abt aerospace,btohqsg
eh shit u said u wanted to isit,btohqsg
Wait long long  SG is defo 100% meritocracy base,btohqsg
cb ever day paper work sia i heard,btohqsg
come out work for GE Boeing Airbus and the like,btohqsg
Boeing n Airbus r apparently p good employers in sg,btohqsg
Yea if u hv the passion for it  just go chase it,btohqsg
at first i wanted air force  but i heard from my air force friend not worth,btohqsg
like everyday plan events do paperwork etc,btohqsg
Tend to seek opinion and some ppl easy to be swayed by what others say (me too actually),btohqsg
but again  you'd think that if you could take it in SG  there'd be tutors for it in SG too...,btohqsg
flight planning is such a pain,btohqsg
like out of no where tries to convince me don't choose aerospace go NUS,btohqsg
Meanwhile i ruled ntu out just coz i dun want stay on campus and travelling is headache,btohqsg
DFD A350 aso dunno wait until when,btohqsg
Wait isnt the application actually over,btohqsg
Or u got offered nd dunno if u should accept,btohqsg
but understandable I making my own freeware aso,btohqsg
i actually dk. i just know when i transferred to kong hwa i suddenly had to take hdl,btohqsg
cause some jaes dont do chinese as their mt,btohqsg
My batch has 2 indian jae students. Neither do chinese as mtTake of that what you will,btohqsg
why your friend say NUS tho,btohqsg
I mean theres an indian ip girl but she did hcl so idk if it counts,btohqsg

WAUT NO I MEAN FIX PLANES,btohqsg
Wait damn they will be damn left out sia…like whole sch majority chinese (i think the same situation in rv too coz im not particularly sure but i think rv is sap),btohqsg
Oh wah chinese as her mother tongue,btohqsg
Not rly leh they are quite social,btohqsg
Im the only one in my whole cohort in my course,btohqsg
i wanna do smth animal/bio related but zoology prospects not good in sg so i guess ill be a bio cher,btohqsg
@Starry787bro i fking love oc  dh interlock,btohqsg
Idk if it counts but there is a guy fr same jc but a different batch (coz ns),btohqsg
surely I can't be the only one here looking for EJU prep courses?,btohqsg
Maybe try asking on the reddit,btohqsg
Not so much about ‘the only one in my cohort / my sch’ but more of majority of my coursemates are either poly or elite jcs,btohqsg
i went into uni with 0 contact with anyone before ns lol,btohqsg
how chinsesy is dhs honestly  like what yiming said  does it do assembly in chinese?,btohqsg
my time the only times it was super chinese was certain chinese centric extra things we learned  then principal's addresses always in chi bc he's phd in chinese lol,btohqsg
and this was before dhs had jae,btohqsg
i think they only remove the chinesy part for sh cause of jaes,btohqsg
my cher studied chinese media or smth in poly,btohqsg
"even tho the cher was like ""dont skip so many words  if you skip so many i cant give many marks""",btohqsg
anybody here knows whether the selection test for fmath tests olympiad qns  in sec sch syllabus questions but require deeper understanding  or jc math topics? (esp for HCI),btohqsg
i heard that they test like stuff that can be solved using olvl concepts but then it is more higher order thinking,btohqsg
and they want to see ur thought process not rly ur ans,btohqsg
i have a friend taking fmath in hci i can ask him for you,btohqsg
to him the paper is prob v ez cause he did higher math in hwachong high alr so yeah,btohqsg
oh yeah that will be very nice thanks,btohqsg

idk but smth like that la,btohqsg
But very soon you will have your PhD,btohqsg
U get to wear those yee yee ass caps during graduation,btohqsg
my sec sch nearly became a sap sch back in the 1970's,btohqsg
but something bout the surplus of sch places might hinder the sap scheme  my sec sch was dropped frm the list,btohqsg
think i heard of it wat was required lol,btohqsg
im surprised my sch q old but still chapalang,btohqsg
it was apprantly once a chinese medium,btohqsg
damn what is it mainly on tho  geometry calculus or functions etc,btohqsg
idk i think it differs for every sch,btohqsg
Actually ur font is q nice sia,btohqsg
my friend made it to national team,btohqsg
so they get to have a superiority complex,btohqsg
and btw what they said isn't a superiority complexit's a fact,btohqsg
Yo does anyone have OCR A biology unified paper 2023 markscheme? Would be greatly appreciated,btohqsg

Expo for like comforts not bad but imo it ain't a good venue for concert I went there once,btohqsg
Suntec or Capitol theatre is better or just do at the star theatre,btohqsg
WHY WOULD THEY PUT HER THERE,btohqsg
bro the acoustics there are so fucking bad its literally a carpark,btohqsg
and they gave sum41 the star theatre???,btohqsg
no one is sitting down at a sum41 show,btohqsg
why is an orchestral musician being shafted to expo hall,btohqsg
that place + fort canning park shouldnt even be used as gig venues,btohqsg
fuck sum41 can get the aliwal arts centre probably,btohqsg
Not to mention its the expo so the seats are like banquet seats it would not be angled correctly,btohqsg
and then they want to scam people by having dynamic pricing,btohqsg
so they mark the shit up of the prices,btohqsg
only went to expo once i think,btohqsg
for a bf expo if aby1 rmbs it,btohqsg
ya last year at pasir panjang power station,btohqsg
bro it was damn bad my friend got in at 12pm sharp tdy couldnt get tix,btohqsg

whoever thought a huge ass grass patch was great for a gig venue is actually out of their mind,btohqsg
the only worse one ive experienced is like one ok rock,btohqsg
