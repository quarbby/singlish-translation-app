Tbh when my dad said that  i know it was bs coz i have eyes and ears so even if they dun discuss w me  i can hear and see,btohqsg

Yesâ€¦my mum was angry w my dad for bringing me n my sis to japan after my graduation,btohqsg
do you know what is called pigeon translated to chinese?,btohqsg
But ofc my dad just brought me anyways (in a way sacrificing for my sake lahâ€¦coz i think my mum didnt talk to him for a week and only asked him for favors),btohqsg
Becoz any quarrels w my mum  my mum will complain to my aunt (aka her sis),btohqsg
Then she will try her best to talk me out to just accept the facts lah,btohqsg
And then fr what my aunt tell me  it seems like she tells her siblings good things abt me but when talking to me  look down on me,btohqsg
Idk what to call such people,btohqsg
Becoz i dun think my aunt is the kind who bluffs to make me happy,btohqsg
Bluff to make her happy lor,btohqsg

Even my dad tells me it is hard to make my mum see her wrongs  she will never say the word sorry,btohqsg
Tbh im closer to my aunt coz when i was younger  i go out w my aunt coz my mum was busy taking care of my asd bro,btohqsg

He asked my mum to stfu,btohqsg
So if I asked you to do the same does it mean I am worst?,btohqsg
So my mum just stopped talking to him (until we went off to japan  where my mum started talking to him again),btohqsg
The only person my mum didnt make angry so far is my sisâ€¦,btohqsg
