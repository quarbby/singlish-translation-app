Broker's take: DBS says 'relook 2020 winners'  reduce exposure to supermarkets  glove makersDBS Group Research said it is time for investors to reassess their positions  recommending that they focus instead on tech  logistics and yield plays.bt.sg/46oF,btohqsg
Do not follow  DYODD first !!,btohqsg
very nice. can ask dbs short all gloves?,btohqsg
Tomorrow will be a better day.,btohqsg
but fbs says cut gloves and health,btohqsg
using our small singapore to be a basis for report. this broker well done,btohqsg
say focus reits.malls are slowly hollowing out worldwide no thanks to strict govt regulations,btohqsg
dbs shoild lead by example and short all gloves and supermarket till the valley,btohqsg
critical condition increased from below 60k case to 66k inching 67k cases despite deathshaiz all these brokers nowadays hear hear can already.those who buy sell form your own opinion best,btohqsg
for me until the deaths tapers to 2k and critical case drops to 40k convincingly.all these all bullshots.(not counting 2nd wave 3rd wave mutations),btohqsg
Futures red liao. Let‚Äôs see how market reacts tonight,btohqsg
Medtecs says they releasing results next week?,btohqsg
Saw a post on share junction saying so,btohqsg
Have emailed medtecs IR now to confirm,btohqsg
Are you sure?  It went up from 97 cents to 1.43,btohqsg
Time to add SS and gloves. DBS report always a joke,btohqsg
Oh yes correct thanks for the correction Ben,btohqsg
Maybe some medical counters investors got cold feet after reading and started selling spree. Did not check and verify.Shake headddddd,btohqsg
Dunno why MT just cannot cheong,btohqsg
Yes  UG   TG and MT downtrend started around 3 pm. Some investors got the information and got cold feet.  Shake head.,btohqsg
Go to SGX website. Just compare the 3 counters.,btohqsg
It is just very early stage discussions only. It will not be easy to convince EU and US to use China vaccine. Out of question lah. Maybe poor countries.,btohqsg
Quite a flat day today. Hope tomorrow is better üôèüèª,btohqsg
Still a good day overall for counters to rest and recharge,btohqsg
Cannot trust what DBS says in report. That time they recommend buy Riverstone on 6th Aug 2020 TP $5.51 and price start dropping already after the call. Now DBS recommend reduce exposure to gloves. How ironic!https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/brokers-take-dbs-says-relook-2020-winners-reduce-exposure-to-supermarkets-glove,btohqsg
They jus wan us to invest in the blue cheaps la,btohqsg
SgYuancan help to chart sia engineering? Appreciates!,btohqsg
As of now  cash cow are medical counters.,btohqsg
If the Analyst doesn‚Äôt know this  Super Chum.,btohqsg
This one real liao ba haha,btohqsg
He want MCO till end 2021So he can just zzz thru,btohqsg
i need to go to my farm over there soon,btohqsg
if 2021 my stuffs all uplorry already,btohqsg
If he openAll crime going up again,btohqsg
Then he think close betterNo problem,btohqsg
ah so is you think only lanvm later i go see hear what he say,btohqsg
Dear Valued Customers Please be informed that we have uplifted the following trading restrictions as of 06/10/2020:UG HEALTHCAREYou can now submit online order for the counter through POEMS platform as per normal.,btohqsg
TBH I think dbs analysts recommendation mostly baseless.. listened to them for a while for capitaland and comfortdelgro  analysts keep saying ‚Äúnext quarter will go up‚Äù and always go down for years,btohqsg
So  might actually be a good sign they suggest to sell medical counters üòÇ,btohqsg
After following their report for some time  had the same feeling,btohqsg
those recommendation ok labut maybe q3 which is now then can see,btohqsg
JT and MT Q3 results expected to be good ah ?,btohqsg
They need ppl to buy so they can sell mah,btohqsg
Need to manage expectations. Good is subjective  buyers buying into MT expecting it to run up crazily have to be really careful.Nothing is certain.,btohqsg
Some times I use their reports as reverse indicator. Think abt this  their analyst's report is half guessing the direction of medical needs going forward. On the contrary  the recent share buyback and EPF moving the unda into medical stocks rather than those sectors recommended by DBS analyst. So take your pick.,btohqsg
Ya cannot fully trust them. Must take a pinch of salt.,btohqsg
Please sell down! I planning to buy some,btohqsg
TOP in the industry and not credible in assessment.,btohqsg
Just remember. TG & RS boss bought them the shares at what price recently? They know very well whatever happens  it doesn‚Äôt affect their businesses until2022/2023. So panic sell at ur own loss. üôÇ,btohqsg
Its like petrol... oil prices drop but yet petrol still so expensive in Singapore. The Fair Pricing framework or whatever  izzit really relevant?,btohqsg
TG boss where got buy. The company bought n the boss buy is separate matter hor,btohqsg
The company bought & the shares transferred to him,btohqsg
Thats like declaring himself bonus lor,btohqsg
He won‚Äôt be tat stupid to pay for tat price would he?,btohqsg
Or the company is tat stupid?,btohqsg
Wrong qn. Are shareholders stupid enough to continue support TG after the owner play such stunt?Yes company doing well. But then he pocketed a huge part of the earnings by buying shares under the coy n transfer to himself.That is akin to declare a huge bonus to himself at the end of the day. I wonder if his staff who works OT to produce glove gets such bonuses or OT pay not,btohqsg
All rite then. U may be rite,btohqsg
That time I asked  TG vying to overtake Malayan bank on bursa right.So is TG paying better dividend than Malayan bank this year?,btohqsg
Maybe a few months later u will see TG announce the boss transfer his shares to family members n etc liao.,btohqsg
Lol  it will only be one of the source if you win,btohqsg

I think so. Earlier message he say procurri and progen no scared,btohqsg
"According to the resolutions reported by the surveillance business supervision meeting for 11 TDRs with significantly higher premiums  the stock exchange has taken disposal measures  although the premium has declined  but still deviated from the original stock price. During the disposal period  multiple TDRs continued to be announced as valuable for paying attention to transaction information. Securities  investors are requested to be cautious about investment risks. The stock exchange reiterated that investors should learn more about TDR's operating conditions  and through the TDR area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe public information observatory  they should truly understand the TDR's financial business conditions  exchange rates  discounts and premiums  and make investments with caution. TDR is a marketable security whose original shares have been listed abroad and listed in Taiwan at the same time. The prices of the two should be linked. Investors buying TDRs with a higher premium must bear the risk of greater price fluctuations and are prone to major investment losses. There are a total of 13 TDRs listed on the securities centralized trading market. Recently  there have been cases of excessive premiums. Although they belong to different industries  they often go up and down  deviating from the normal trading market. In order to protect the rights and interests of investors  the Stock Exchange has repeatedly reminded investors to pay attention to transaction risks. Related reminders pay attention to transaction risk information. Investors can go to the company homepage (https://www.twse.com.tw/zh/) and click ""Stock Exchange News"" check",btohqsg

is not always about what they doingbut who is doing it,btohqsg
track record so good u cant miss it,btohqsg
wait for this covid to end  their aus proj and local should be not bad i guess,btohqsg
they got into trouble with the law or what?,btohqsg
put on platter will be this liao,btohqsg
can la i dont spoil market i follow genie rate.,btohqsg
do share. i like to knoe your views on CES,btohqsg
doing govt projects... so their construction arm is diversified,btohqsg
hotel biz and property tanked during covid... just wait for recovery,btohqsg
oh i thought you got something new..,btohqsg
but nvm la... go buy the other suggestion,btohqsg
like a hidden play in their buys,btohqsg
why would i have hidden play... lol,btohqsg
they buy this and that but eventual goal is something hidden,btohqsg
for example whats that one called,btohqsg
i dont think need covid to show how jialat they are,btohqsg
the oxley buy one then lan lan have to sell,btohqsg
so u think it will go lower?,btohqsg
@furion07what was the one oxley buy then lan lan have to sell one huh,btohqsg
Waseh! I was looking at CES when their share price was $1.2x,btohqsg
reference to OKH. also erosion over time,btohqsg
I am actually not afraid of their result cause if not  they will not intend to release it at oct. My concern is the market... will need to see how the market react these few days.,btohqsg
assets sold tohaiyi groupthey acquire at 1.18 from Lim family for CES controlthey took okh at 10 cent injected 50m for 500m shares and took controlthey want take back their dues  just not from share pricehence the toxicity,btohqsg
but hidden play due the property holdings in uic? or something? cannot remember,btohqsg
i was wondering where is the link with CES when u asked,btohqsg
cash out to the ah jian,btohqsg
as in i thought leo got hidden insight to their purchase,btohqsg
same pic must spam how many times...,btohqsg
so you're thinking that they will trade below 40% below book value?,btohqsg
they are trading. not i think they will,btohqsg
looks like a double top reversal üòÖ,btohqsg
no chance to go back to 1 dollar?,btohqsg
okh trades at 1.5 cent. nav 6 cent. they trade 25% to NAVwhy so impossible for 40%,btohqsg
but if you are in CES. ok la,btohqsg
short mid term maybe 50cents caps?,btohqsg
ok la... you got a point also,btohqsg
if im a controlling shareholder and im not selling my shares... i dont give a shit about the price also,btohqsg
but 5-10 years down the road... who knows,btohqsg
did another screenshot that shows a fuller context.,btohqsg
buying value is a good way to invest  especially big discount to NAV  a big bufferhowever  it pays to look at the management because if the NAV is constantly erodedand if loss makingnothing flows to minorities since loss makingthen if u buy 45 cent CES now5 years later without dividend and nav go to 60 centstill buffer. but u think share price will be? by 40%  maybe from 45 go to 24 cent liaowild guess just saying next to the buffer  alot of things to consider too,btohqsg
Just need maintain and close 245/25 today,btohqsg
if u think their business and assets doesnt justify a 40% price to nav  taking a position make perfect sensenothing right or wrong about itkey is still put a stop loss because i will prefer to believe market is inefficient and if need to get out just get out,btohqsg
in olden daysforums will sayold newspapers,btohqsg
advocated this in medtecs but applies to all stocks. stop loss is essential.,btohqsg
Oh please  don‚Äôt spam mt profit guidance email anymore,btohqsg
im planning to buy a little bit for their dividends...,btohqsg
since currently my portfolio dont have construction sector... and among other competitors... CES is 1 of the biggest,btohqsg
then what's your opinion of lian beng? cash rich,btohqsg
wont be surprised if dividend cutshare price adjust accordingly,btohqsg
i was thinking 44 cents is already a reflection of that down from 60 cents... earnings drop due to covid,btohqsg
Construction sector should be better once phase 3 I reckon. I got some counters all in red. Lol,btohqsg
prolly i wait lower then... 40cents?,btohqsg
i dont really like the idea of CSC... cause their works are not diversified enough,btohqsg
they rent the piling machines doing nothing on site for 3 months... quite scary,btohqsg
unless.... they can dont need to pay the rental for 3 months,btohqsg
if u keen construction i will pay attention to likes of tiong woon hiap tong and crane plays,btohqsg
Construction counters before covid already half dead.,btohqsg
yea... that's why i was looking at tiong woon recently,btohqsg
for the same reason i mentioned above... unless they cant charge the rental for 3 months,btohqsg
your interest in CES is more of their assets and diversification but these are track record of lim family. the new one do education acquisitontrack record like crap,btohqsg
yea... i think im more familiar with the Lim family... didnt know about the ties with Tang,btohqsg
Like Yongnam  how many years they have been losing $?,btohqsg
no ties. they sold high happily only raymond staying there,btohqsg
but Lim still have some holdings right,btohqsg
now i understand why the price so stable... cause no freefloat at all,btohqsg
I agree. Csc and Yongnam is gone alr I think,btohqsg
Haha  who have such a limit to put buy queue 5m shares avarga,btohqsg
for the past 2 months la,btohqsg
raymond got 20m. the rest literal cashout. coz tangs only want up to 29.9%,btohqsg
Construction hard la... every week meeting  say 2 weeks later will start work. from 7 Sept become 21 Sept. Now tell me end Oct....,btohqsg
Ya construction put in freezer lo,btohqsg
got 1 piling contractor i saw is much better than CSC... but too bad not listed,btohqsg
Hua Tiong... cause they own all their equipment,btohqsg
This morning I listen leylio. üìª. It say construction sector facing cash-flow problem. % increase from 30+% to 40+%,btohqsg
but the 1 listed Hua Tiong Global fake 1... recently get sued by this Hua Tiong,btohqsg
And alot.big companies filing bankruptcy  worry for local banks,btohqsg
yours still doing OK right... later we discussed here get too personal,btohqsg
Isoteam considered construction or not ah?,btohqsg
time for me to go hang clothes liao,btohqsg
