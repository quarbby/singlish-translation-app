For online purchases? I have an amount coming up a purchase for digikey in USD,btohqsg
I‚Äôm curious. Do we really need to pair CRMC + Amaze to pay hospital bills via HealthHub? Why can‚Äôt we use CRMC to pay directly? Any benefit from Amaze?I know that there is a monthly spend for CRCM capped at $1000/mth and WWMC at $2000/mth. What is the next credit card to use for hospital bill amount > $3000?,btohqsg
health hub no need Amaze. OP is asking about paying hospital  Amaze+CRMC work for hospital that cannot be paid via healthhub alsociti smrt if via healthhub,btohqsg
Do you mean paying hospital bill over the counter using Amaze? I didn‚Äôt know that they don‚Äôt accept CRMC direct. üòÖThanks for your suggestion to use Citi SMRT as the third credit card for paying hospital bill via HealthHub. üôè,btohqsg
amaze convert to online to get 4mpd on crmc.btw dun think healthhub can split bill,btohqsg
A little blur. What‚Äôs the differences below? Both can get 4mpd right?CRMC > HealthHubCRMC > Amaze > HealthHub,btohqsg

CRMC > HealthHub  yesCRMC > Amaze > HealthHub yesCRMC > Hospital counter NoCRMC > Amaze > Hospital counter Yes,btohqsg

Wow  that‚Äôs a very good explanation in details. Now I get it. Thanks a lot!,btohqsg
Ah! Which means use UOB ACB 1.7% still the better choice then,btohqsg
Today top up grab w amex tcb still in time?,btohqsg
can use citi smrt for 5% rebate. Or ocbc titanium if mcc is in whitelist for 4mpd.dun use uob absolute cos the fx fee is much higher than 1.7% rebate,btohqsg
Agree  and can only sign up once  hence the 1% bonus interest on top of the 4.35% is valid for 2 months from sign up month  cap at $300 and on fresh funds from previous month only,btohqsg
Citi I have enough cc Liao. Fx don‚Äôt care cos claim company ü´¢ü´£,btohqsg
Can I just confirm that using 3rd party apps like atome and pay later functions only allows you to reap the rewards on the first out of three payments? Or can I reap rewards out of all three payments if I split the bill,btohqsg
can get everyday+ rewards (1% bonus interest and 1% rebate for hsbc card spend/giro bill payment) every month so long meet the requirements of transfer in $2k/$5k and 5 transactions minimally on alternate months. But of cos the 1% bonus interest is only on incremental average daily balance wrt previous month's.,btohqsg
I think OCBC has extended the credit card sign up promotion till 30 Apr 2023. I‚Äôm not very sure but it‚Äôs good for those who haven‚Äôt sign up yet.,btohqsg
