It’s literally down there in your screenshot on the “new fund” criteria,btohqsg

Hello guys  trying to pool some ideas togetherI have to hit AMEX bonus but as I have other cards that really do 4mpd  any ideas for what I can pay with it?A lot of online spend  I have my revo  AMAZE + CITI  PPV can do 4mpd. Same for paywave…,btohqsg
U have to choose u want amex bonus or the 4mpd from other card. It is that simple.,btohqsg
Let say $1k spend for Amex bonus34k points + 1200 base point for ascend$1k on CRMC 4K point ?I think clearly shows which earn more right ?,btohqsg
not if I really wanna squeeze and AMEX bonus is only for all non 4mpd expenses 😄,btohqsg
Travel is 1 categories all 3 card don’t have  since hsbc nerf it recently,btohqsg
I think better to just clear the bonus  less trouble to think about it later ?Or if you really want to squeeze and  let say big spending coming up then spend 4mpd card max out all then leftover throw into Amex,btohqsg
huh then why still need to ask lol,btohqsg
only you will know what you have to spend on  then use those that dont qualify on amex and see if can hit the required spending. if cannot then you have to sacrifice certain 4mpd on amex,btohqsg
Any hack to clock the kris+ Feb master challenge,btohqsg

Ask your older relative with no card  offer to pay on your card and take their cash then,btohqsg

Good morning guys  can I use my Kris flyer membership to earn miles from my family members?,btohqsg
So the individual person should have own krisflyer membership to earn krisflyer miles right? Or can add them as our nominees to earn miles?,btohqsg
You can’t use your KrisFlyer to earn for your family . They need to have their own account to credit. The nominees is for u to use your own miles to redeem for tickets for your family members.,btohqsg
Sir I saw a t&c in airlines websites and it states that KrisFlyer members who purchase tickets for their nominees but who are not part of the itinerary will not earn KrisFlyer miles.What this things means?,btohqsg
Means if u nvr travel. U only buy for your parents. Only ur parents get miles.,btohqsg
I rmb if u redeem miles to purchase ticket also don’t get miles for flying. 😂,btohqsg
Quick question:  need to spend 1k on my new amex card.   What are the easy spend I can do?  Grab top up don't count   insurance dont count.Surprised me that SPC patrol also do the count.   Ikea or ntuc vouchers will lose out on their discounts etc  right?,btohqsg
Card fees + another 1.5%? Or total 1.5%?Anyway still can use 4mpd cards like Uob visa signature.Do they allow splitting payment,btohqsg
See if cardup is included in spend then u can pay a fee to clock spending on your insurancr,btohqsg

But the uen to transfer the amount is 201628225cfas which points to you technologies  apparently link to youtrip. May i know how come youtrip can be involved in the person's acct?,btohqsg

How to counter or report this scam ah?,btohqsg
How to know if the application within first 5 applicants?,btohqsg

Means someone has already reported her before me.Now she claim i was the one who reported her  and she is going to sue me for damages for wrongly reporting her. And also calling me the scammer trying to fish her information...Just a share to everyone...,btohqsg
Free must be free without any fees involved 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg

For existing user I think it just pop out for me,btohqsg
LOL sue you for damages... In what grounds?,btohqsg
How do you know the account is a personal account or business account?,btohqsg
personal youtrip won't have UEN. the UEN is probably youtrip top-up via PayNow,btohqsg
The person maybe represents a company and the account is the youtrip biz account? Possible?,btohqsg
youtrip business account not the same as personal account ma. if you head over to your yt app now there's no UEN option haha,btohqsg
"When i try try paynow  it says ""you technologies""  uen indicated is 201628225cfas. Wonder how the scammer would get the money. To her youtrip acct?",btohqsg
Paying money to get a freebie is old age scam. Stay alert and report the mobile number to ScamShield (govern by SPF),btohqsg
It also depends on how much you are paying on taxes,btohqsg
Is hsbc EGA Cashback ending in march?,btohqsg
Are you asking because sms said so?,btohqsg
is trading income taxed in sg?,btohqsg
there is no income tax due on sales of shares  properties  and other intangible assets in Singapore  but they become taxable when your primary purpose in buying and selling is to make profits.This especially applies to traders or dealers whose income is generated simply from conducting one’s business. Therefore  the nature and source of your business’s income need to be assessed. Gains can be considered as taxable income if the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) regards your activities as a profit-generating trade.,btohqsg
Oh just saw this thread. In the current high interest environment  the KF account is not worth while. Last time when it's 0.05% interest then it was super good.Think of it this way. Your 100k have interest cost of around $300 today. But the miles they give you is only 5k/MTH. That's only worth about $50.  So obviously not worth.,btohqsg
but people get into stocks and properties obviously with the sole intention of profitting  so it dosent make sense,btohqsg
UOB KF card is only good for its uncapped limited. So like deposit/ last min and can't split so many months  etc.,btohqsg
There is no capital gains tax in Singapore. Generally  the gains derived from the sale of a property/investment in Singapore are not subjected to tax as it is a capital gain. However  the gains may be taxable if one is in the business of trading sharesSource :https://www.aseanbriefing.com/news/a-guide-to-taxation-in-singapore/#:~:text=There%20is%20no%20capital%20gains the%20business%20of%20trading%20shares.,btohqsg
This should be more accurate   directly from IRAShttps://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/what-is-taxable-what-is-not/gains-from-sale-of-property-shares-and-financial-instruments,btohqsg
yup saw it before  just wanted to cfm,btohqsg
In short see if you part time or full time (main source of income) High likelyhood Yes taxable.,btohqsg
Anyone sal credit criteria still not tracked for uob one? Mine got issue leh I tsfr fast+sal payment or isit cos cny hols haven’t update haha,btohqsg

So if I buy tickets for my family members (3 pax) and then whose krisflyer membership number should I quote in while booking?,btohqsg
Is there any groups feature in Singapore airlines that lets you add your family as a group and then can earn miles together.,btohqsg
Each pax can input their individual krisflyer,btohqsg
So let’s say 3 pax traveling and they do have krisflyer membership and so  can they present my membership ID while boarding? And do they check whether the membership belongs to them or not?,btohqsg
Individual membership that belong to then at booking,btohqsg
So  If the passenger forgot to mention their membership ID while booking and can present while boarding right?,btohqsg
So will the officers check the membership belongs to them or not?,btohqsg
It have to be under their own name as mention quite a few time before when u ask question about krisflyer membership. U CANT CLOCK MILES USING THEIR MEMBERHSIP OR THEY CANT CLOCK MILES USING YOUR MEMBERHSIP,btohqsg
Ok thank you sir for helping me.,btohqsg
Ofcuz they will check before credit. At most u try luck then u see no miles credit lo.,btohqsg

Hi can I clarify/double checkI have a UOB ppv card. For first $1110 I get 4mpd on spending. Afterwards 0.4mpdIf I buy a $1.5k item  $1110 of it would earn 4mpd and the remaining would earn 0.4mpd right? Don’t need be single receipt less than $1110 right?,btohqsg
Does ocbc 365 cc has any promotion. Can't seems to see any  should I wait longer for a promotion to be out then sign up. I just created a 360 acc,btohqsg
Any option traders here? Would love to connect :),btohqsg
I’m sorry for the confusing term “trader”. While I’m a net option seller  I don’t trade. I average about $1k USD a month now. I would love to connect with like-minded people.,btohqsg
Nice! I hope the journey’s been well for you!,btohqsg
For those that apply for Citi card via Sing saver  am I guaranteed a ipad rewards if I hit 500 within a single month spend?,btohqsg
why not trade on the daily? do you know how to do TA? or what other confirmations do you use,btohqsg
I don’t believe it’s a question of why or why not. I’m doing it this way because it suits my investment style and it would be quite windy to justify it right here.,btohqsg
you trade on patterns? or which indicators or analysis do you use?,btohqsg
Just simple MACD and RSI but most importantly on underlying I don’t mind getting assigned on.How’s your options trading journey?,btohqsg
just macd and rsi is able to keep you consistent monthly? thats awsome!,btohqsg
While I don’t think using those indicators are what contributed to my consistent profit  I believe overcomplicated strategies in investing does little good to majority of the people. See many major successful fund managers out there. They have boring portfolios but they have double digit returns track records.,btohqsg
You sell cash secured puts and then sell covered call if assigned?,btohqsg
Yes  while it’s not as capital efficient as say like verticals or condors  it helps me make decent income monthly so I am contented with it.,btohqsg
I have btc in hard wallet. Which platform is recommended if I intend to sell and withdraw to my bank?,btohqsg
Hi all some food for thought.With the closure of SA next year  some of you are thinking of setting aside FRS of 426k at 55 to with $4460 at 70 hoping to live until 100 so he will collect $1.6m.but do u know that your 426k given to cpf at the age of 55 of compound 4% for 45 yrs would become $2.5m. so u think u r ripping cpf off by living longer but actually cpf still wins if they can generate 4% yield yoy with ur money.,btohqsg
Same food for thought  where else can find an almost risk free $4460 payout for 45 years with 426K investment?,btohqsg
Am I still consider a new customer for opening SC Bonusaver if I'm holding to SC Esaver account ?,btohqsg
100 years old? Seriously not even sure if the person brain is working properly even if manage to live that long.,btohqsg
Will i earn 3mpd for uob krisflyer + amaze for dining spend in thailand?,btohqsg
Interest earned $426k x 4%  = $17040 per year or $1420 per month.How much we can get per month from CPF if have $426k in RA after retired?If the amount is more than $1420 per month. I believe that remaining amount given to members will be withdrawn from $426k. The interest earned next year will be lesser because smaller amount in RA?,btohqsg
A win-win situation. $ for the next generation.,btohqsg
Yeah agree. Win win for everyone. Good for normal people to get monthly fixed guaranteed income and good for government to have enough $,btohqsg
If I have HSBC life insurance  am I still eligible to be a new customer for ega and credit card promotion?,btohqsg
yes  new. Join the flash deal tomorrow 12pmhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/174576,btohqsg
I apply SC card through singsaver on 18 dec till now never receive $300 reward . Is it normal ?,btohqsg
Food for thought  slight correction to your calculations:426k compounded at 4% for 15 years with no withdrawals is 775k775k compounding at 4% but withdrawing $4460 monthly will only last you 21-22 years of withdrawals.So if you live till 100  you’re indeed getting a better deal from CPF than if you were to try and DIY your own CPF LIFE.It’s even worse if you tried to DIY CPF LIFE payouts starting from age 65  you would run out of money by the time you’re 80.,btohqsg
Thanks Chris. For the qualifying spend here clauses here with payment to insurance company means that HSBC life insurance payment can be used to clock the spend?,btohqsg
Thanks for the calculations. Though I still wonder why people are still so against CPF Life,btohqsg
Lots of numbers flying around.I also dunno whose are accurate whose are inaccurate.,btohqsg
You're welcome to double check my numbers 🙂 I used the following calculators:https://www.360financialliteracy.org/Calculators/Savings-Distribution-Calculatorhttps://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator,btohqsg
I’m for CPF life (but just at FRS levels).So I’m with you….. hahahaha.,btohqsg
I can understand if someone is against it as a matter of principle cos it's a forced insurance scheme  if they say they want to control what they do with their money etc. etc.But if one accepts the idea that it is an insurance scheme  then naturally some must win and some must lose for it to mathematically work out for the cohort  and so if one's calculations show that everyone is losing badly either 1) something is very wrong with the system and no one has noticed 2) the calculations are wrong😊,btohqsg
Question.  Do dividends paid out to SRS accounts add to the annual cap automatically (tracked as contribution)?,btohqsg
I also think that while we may have a lot of attention and energy to manage our own investments right now  by the time we get to 55/65/70 we may just decide to heck it and settle for a guaranteed return instead 😂,btohqsg
some need to wait up to 5 month   some is quick processing ( only if its stated ) else mostly is 5 months,btohqsg

Very true. At that age I would prefer less hassle to manage investments and good to have a guaranteed income monthly till I die regardless of economic conditions or how my investments are faring,btohqsg
The problem is the inflation. What we see now is S$4460 every month in the future. 20 years later  the future $4460 actually is equivalent to $2000 today.,btohqsg
Yup. But there’s also some amount of lifestyle disinflation as you get older too  spending less on clothes  food  travel. (Assuming your healthcare needs are already taken care of  which will be the major component still increasing as you grow older),btohqsg
No it won’t count towards the annual SRS contribution cap,btohqsg
Ah that’s why there’s the option of an escalating plan to combat said inflation,btohqsg
Until I reinvest the sum deposited into my bank srs account  is that correct?,btohqsg
The only thing that counts against the annual SRS contribution limit is when you deposit Cash into said SRS account. Any gain  loss or dividends/interests from SRS investments won’t count,btohqsg
I see thanks for the info.So let’s say I received $100 dividends from my SRS holdings for 2023 on Jan 1  2025As of 2024  I’d still have the full SRS 15.3K right?That means it’a possible for me to deposit 15.3K for this year’s tax relief but invest 15.4K (the dividends earned) back to whatever instrument?Thanks again,btohqsg
Since SA is going to close when I reach 55. Assuming I have no problem achieving the FRS. Wouldn't it be a good strategy to move my OA to SA or top up my SA to get the 4.08٪ as much as I could before I turn 55 so that I can earn that 4.08% compounding and any excess will flow back to OA rather than letting my OA fund sit still at 2.5%? And i can withdraw my OA when i reach 55? Of course this is based on the assumption that I have no use of my OA.,btohqsg
That is what i am doing,btohqsg
yes correct. so if u really have no use for your OA funds  u can top up to SA as early as possible to gain the extra interest.,btohqsg
For those below 55 and SA already hit FRS  what is the best strategy now?,btohqsg
previously is many using SA shielding loophole to create a high yield savings acc from CPF SA after 55.Thus they can choose whether to withdraw the amount or int portion on yearly basis to facilitate early retirement or maybe also can use to fund travel funds.,btohqsg
Yep  but same logic with or without new CPF rules. In the old rule  you can also transfer OA to SA  then that SA forms part of FRS instead of pulling from mandatory SA contributions. Resulting in mandatory excess SA/OA withdrawable,btohqsg
No change in strategy for those below 55 imo,btohqsg
basically nothing much to do now. Get higher paying job to increase cpf contribution more or create more income stream as sole proprietor so that you can MC more into your cpf acc to get higher int out during these few yrs till 55?,btohqsg
any one have any idea if using citi cash back+ master card for snack investment have any cash back?,btohqsg
Hi all  one of my family members is intending to apply for uob one account. He dosent hold any uob before. For this promo  if he puts in new funds $100k and dont withdrawn this funds  can get $558 right?Second question is  upon opening the account  need to deposit money immediately? Or is it possible to wait 2-3 days later then deposit the funds?,btohqsg
Only Amex got miles? I remember my Amex give miles that time,btohqsg
Nope Amex also don’t get miles all insurance are under the no earning,btohqsg
I got it when I top up using Amex Sia miles card that time,btohqsg
I think Amex cash back also give cash back. If I’m not mistaken   but I’m not sure about other card provider,btohqsg
I only know of UOB absolute Amex give cashback 1.7% other then that no other ? Unless you using a payment provider to earn ?,btohqsg
think u need to read the tnc of amex cards in detail,btohqsg
I only know they reward for Chubb’s,btohqsg
Wish to sign up HSBC revolution card for sign up promo  but renovation spending not eligible to clock for sign up related transaction?,btohqsg
Sorry I missed it out but I did said suggest uob absolute Amex which is a better option ? HF not widely available for average unless you want to go through the hassle ?,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website can propose a list of best credit cards to use based on merchant or mcc code. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
UOB stash not showing the reached milestones for bonus interest in the app. Heard usually it only shows up in the following month after newly opening the account  is that true?,btohqsg
Hi  What's the best credit card to use to buy a new phone from Singtel? On heymax there is only 1 MCC code for Singtel. Not sure phone will be under this MCC or not?,btohqsg
If U transfer OA to SA. Then u will lose the chance for RTSU for income tax relief. Depends on your strategy,btohqsg
You can provided your SA is not max out (hit FRS) and you really do not have any use of OA in the mid term to long termalso is irreversible. Cannot take out and put back into OA,btohqsg
RSTU is a tax relief hack. That some people employ. The thought process is: if I'm going to put aside this money for retirement. Might as well put it in SA and get 1) 4% ROI 2) Tax relief also.But it depends on you annual/overall saving or investment strategy that you are adopting,btohqsg
So if there no plan of using cash to top up  the transfer of OA to SA make sense?,btohqsg
As long as you don't intend to use the OA in the immediate future. E.g. housing  child education etc.,btohqsg
Hi  did you all change your Citi rewards card from statement month to calendar month ?,btohqsg
If it’s more convenient for you then u change lo😂 I changed for my uob. The rest nvr cuz I find it troublesome 😅,btohqsg

Hi  if I have 200kIs it worth to transfer to1️⃣Uob one account - transfer 100k (currently -0balance) - get $588 angpao + 5% interest (uob salary + $500 credit card spend )2️⃣UOB stash account (currently 0) - transfer $100k get $588 angpao + $3k in interest a year,btohqsg
You may want read clause 2.5 in the TnC.,btohqsg
uob stash is 3% p.a. interest and u only get one set of $588  so uob one is better. Put the other $100k somewhere else,btohqsg
Tfs from which bank and what's the exact steps you did?,btohqsg

oops i'm sorry i replied to the wrong text haha. meant to reply to Sofyan,btohqsg
the need for OTP is set by merchant.idk that the type of OTP is set by merchant but i guess its possible. like citibank cards uses the app for authentication. In fact  i prefer app rather than SMS as some of us switched SIM card when travel and can't receive that SMS unless we switch back to SG SIM card,btohqsg
I dont change Citi too  I dont see the need  but I change for UOB and OCBC,btohqsg

"the ""catch"" is you will only start earning 1% rebate after you completed 2K deposit + 5 transaction. so if you only fulfilled that condition on 29th of the month  you only have 1-2 more days to earn the 1% rebate (eg  fulfilled these 2 conditions on 1st of each mth)",btohqsg

Nice explanation  but different view point and believer. Eric is long time in property.

https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/rates-online/foreign-currency-foreign-exchange.pagetry this. i think the old consensus is that brokerage like webull has better FX (to verify)  so convert there and bring back SGD to DBS. Or keep it as USD when bringing back to DBS,btohqsg
that dosent rlly help  but thankyou  i use webull to exchange 100k sgd to usd  theres 700 sgd missing somewhere in the transactions,btohqsg
0.7%  could it be some fees or conversion loss?,btohqsg
no idea  I only calculate based on 700 divided by 100k,btohqsg
most financial institutions won't publish the spread. you just have to compare rates across FI to know which is a better deal,btohqsg
after converted  700 missing arnd thr,btohqsg
missing when compared against? google rate?,btohqsg
topped up 100k  after conversion  sgd left 99300+,btohqsg
that's the spread. FI earns that. its common. so you top up SGD100K  convert to USD  then convert back SGD again.,btohqsg
you enter the same numbers in DBS website  you will see what's your ending SGD,btohqsg
so after i converted bck sgd  ill be bck at 100k again? dosent make sense,btohqsg
each currency conversion will have money eaten away. do you know how it works? it is like money changer counters,btohqsg
damn   it’s a lot  if i change 300k  it’s 1.8 k gone,btohqsg
why would you convert FX at a non FX trading broker...,btohqsg
the best broker to change FX in my opinion is Interactive Brokers... USD2 fee and their bid/ask spread is very competitive,btohqsg
and needless to say..  NEVER do FX transactions (small tens of dollars ok la) at retail banks,btohqsg
3% p.a. for the first 10k.,btohqsg

"anybody knows how does CPF pay interest? and how they charge the accured interest?From my understanding and FAQ on website1) CPF interest calculated based on following function =min(opening bal start of month  closing bal end of month)so assume if you are new  and assume Jan (first month of year) your opening bal at start of month = $0  but employer give you CPF contribution (say $100) at 14th of month  so by end of month you have $100 at end of month.But interest for Jan = $0 if follow the function as above.so interst whether 2.5%  4.08% etc will be recoreded for the prevailing 11 months as simple interest computation and pay out on 31st Dec of the year.Normally... even banks or FI will work on the fact that the interest will be computed back  eg...Jan int = $1  then principal for Feb will be +$1  then principal for Mar will be +$2 so on and so forth.... so not really clear how CPF compute interest if they disbursed out annually.So leads me to point (2) on Accured Interest.2) CPF website states  monies are charged interest from the moment we withdraw  either for Education or Housing  because the money is suppose to be there to ""earn"" the interest in the first place.However  accrued interest is calcualted the moment you withdraw the money..Not calculated by the function =min(opening bal start of month  closing bal end of month)  and it is compunded monthly.So say if I get CPF housing grant for HDB  say $20k  the money came into my OA  in Jan  then middle of the month  the money was disbursed to pay HDB.But because the money is grant  and ""granted"" to me  it should have help ""accumulate"" interest if it was not spend...But if following the funciton of=min(opening bal start of month  closing bal end of month) The month came in mid of month  and went out before end of month  so min balance will be $0 if follow example from (1) above. So no accured interst for Jan. correcT?I asked CPF  even called and went down  they cannot answer. only tell me the system is different  and keep wrapping up their answer.If you cannot convinve  you confuse  and wrap around multiple layer of conditions  seems like it.Although interest not a lot at beginning  but its good habit to understand or be transparent how the accured is calcualted.When you borrow money from FI or banks  the T&C and monthl statement will show you P + I clearly Any experts got answer?",btohqsg
Eh i thot its based on daily balance,btohqsg
Saving account just like any other bank (gxs  trust  etc),btohqsg
This can't be the case  because CPF website states that monies deposited into CPF accounts only start earning interest in the following month.,btohqsg
1. It's very clear cut. Every month CPF computes with the lowest amount after withdrawals and before deposits. So any deposited amounts will start earning interest on the following month  any withdrawn amounts will lose interest from that month itself. On the last day of the year  they will add up all the interest that was previously computed for each month including Dec.Example:To simplify  we'll just assume other policies don't exist.You just started working in Jan 24 and have $0 in your OA. Your pay comes in for Jan 24 and your contribution to OA is $100. Your lowest amount for Jan 24 is $0  so interest computed is $0. OA: $100.Contribution to OA for Feb 24 is another $100. Your lowest amount for Feb 24 is $100  interest computed is $0.20 at 2.5% p.a. OA: $200.Contribution for OA for Mar 24 is another $100  but you withdraw $100 for HDB. Your lowest amount of Mar 24 is $100  interest computed is $0.21 at 2.5% p.a. OA: $200.You lost your job and did not contribute till end Dec 24. Last day of the year they will add up all your computed interest altogether  $0 + $0.20 + $0.21 + $0.20 + ... + $0.20 + $0.21  you'll get $2.26. Your end amounts would be $202.26 in OA.2. Taking the example above  the $100 withdrawn for HDB WILL lose interest from Mar 24 onwards. Which means the accrued interest after factoring in Dec 24 would be $2.06. You would have owed $102.06 in total to your OA.Addition of grants to the example:To simplify  let's say you received and withdrawn $100 in HDB grants in Mar 24.Your new lowest amount in Mar 24 is $0. Interest computed will be $0. OA: $200.Your computed accrued interest will instead be calculated at 2.5% p.a. for the $200 in Mar 24  which is $4.16. So you'll owe $204.16 in total to your OA.And your end amounts in OA would be $202.05 instead of $202.26.,btohqsg
Yes  it is as stated in the cpf website. Interest is earned on the lowest balance of the month. If the lowest balance of the month is $100k  then u earn interest on the 100k. It dosnt matter if u have $5mil inside cpf for 1 day  it still earn interest on the 100k.,btohqsg
So based on your calculation. You calculated CPF gave you less interest or overcharge u on accrued interest?,btohqsg
The computation won’t tally with CPF’s if the concept is not aligned..,btohqsg
Hi Melvyn  thank you for the detail summary.Can i check how you derive $0.20 for the $100 sitting in Feb? should use 11/12 or by days? xx/365?,btohqsg
we all would like monies to be given higher rates  or compounded more regularly. GXS awards (and disburse) interest daily. major banks does it monthly. CPF does it annually. but who's got the risk-free rate and who doesn't? That's also key to remember...,btohqsg
29 days in Feb 24  366 days in year 2024,btohqsg

idk about target. Its not doing as well compared to Kmart  as it is always empty. Slightly more pricier and less variety compared to kmart.,btohqsg
Kmart has like a dropshipping model  so their catalogue change very often one. That's why I think the QC of their product vary  cuz they don't produce most of their product directly.,btohqsg

https://tigr.link/6xnpQwEh wait this card doesn’t charge foreign dynamic exchange rate fee and has ‘competitive’ exchange rate but charges $5 for ATM withdrawal and 2% fee.This is stupid.YouTrip can withdraw 1st $400 free  like wise for revolut also similar and trust bank card is free to withdraw.Looks like this card is not useful for overseas withdrawal of cash.Also  no can only top up using bank account and the balance on the card cannot withdraw back to back account but must transfer/clear back to the Tiger account which adds 1 more layer coz it might delay withdrawing cash.,btohqsg
I starting to wonder what’s the use case of this card.Didn’t Tiger do some market research before releasing a card into an already crowded card market. There isn’t a clear use case for this card.,btohqsg
Isn't it clear? It's to get more people onto their trading platform.,btohqsg
They would if there’s a strong use case but they released a subpar debit card so there won’t be traction,btohqsg
Hi  in order to apply for credit card the minimum age is 21 yrs right? So If I’m under 21 yrs and is it possible to apply for? I saw some videos and they said you can apply for credit card under your parents name if you’re under 21 yrs and don’t have income.,btohqsg
So the card is not under my name right?,btohqsg
So whatever rewards comes from the card is credited to my parents account right? But in order to obtain good credit score for myself at early age  the credit card should be under my name right?,btohqsg
You have no credit card record until you are a principal cardholder,btohqsg
cant seems to tally... any expert can help?,btohqsg
Guys  is there any best savings account to get interest for $10000 amount?,btohqsg
yes  spending from supplementary card gets accumulated to your parent's prinipal card account and rewards go to ur parent card account. Actually credit score is not important at all,btohqsg
what u mean? looks tallied to me,btohqsg
Opening Balance for SA is 426.82 sitting from 1st Jan until 31st Dec.. cal at 4% = $17.07Interest allocated is $34.65need to find the missing $17.58Cal $3.33 sitting from Feb to 31st Dec. 334days/365 = $0.12Cal $45.06 sitting from Aug to 31st Dec 153days/365 = $0.76Cal $51.06 sitting from Sep to 31st Dec 122days/365 = $0.68Cal $7.13 sitting from Oct to 1st Dec 92days/365 = $0.07Int sum = $1.63,btohqsg
Doesn’t seem attractive enough to apply for this card,btohqsg
Doesn't matter  use month or day  the ratio is same. I already calculated from the beginning of a new month.Even the $3.33 credited in Jan. I calculated it for the month of Feb up till 31 Dec.How did it tally from your calculation?,btohqsg
Maribank (2.88pc till 31 Mar)  gxs (2.68pc in saving pocket) are some of the fuss free options now,btohqsg

How is the calculation? care to elaborate?,btohqsg
I added all and got 23.35 but they gave you 34.65  but I did divide 12 instead. I already counted 5% because first 60k gets 1% additional.,btohqsg
Wait.. the first 60k get 1% additional dont need to satisfy the minimum of 60k first?so any balance on first 60k = add 1%?means SA = 5% instead of 4%?,btohqsg
I counted 1.78 for Jan  1.79 for Feb  1.98 for Aug  2.19 for Sep  2.22 for Oct,btohqsg
ok thanks for sharing  i rounded to 5%  and got similar numbers to your value. but still not understand how CPF get their numbers 🧠 by right the logic and math should add up  regardless :X,btohqsg
It's because the extra 1% for OA is actually credited to SA,btohqsg
OMG so the interest from OA 2.5% + extra 1% from OA principal goes to SA?,btohqsg
2.5% from OA stays in OA  extra 1% from OA goes to SA.,btohqsg
I just tried and finally managed to log in,btohqsg

First 60k compounded gets 1% more,btohqsg
Chris  for the ending question you had  I think hypothetically  if one were to transfer their OA to SA accumulated sum to FRS throughout their lifetime  then the remaining SA from mandatory contribution and interest will be ‘transferred’ to OA instead of RA (since RA hits FRS made up of OA to SA transfer).However  if the OA to SA transfer (or RSTU) happens to exceed FRS  then all of which will go to RA as they are reserved sums. But it still means all the mandatory contributions in SA will be transferred back to OA.So in a sense yes SA can go back to OA  but if each dollar is non-fungible then that OA transfer/RSTU is not the dollar that gets reversed to OA  but it will come from the mandatory portion instead.,btohqsg
This is my understanding. It’s not a clear cut “SA can be reversed back to OA” but it depends.,btohqsg
Let's say I did not hit frs at 55. My OA has 20k minimum. My SA has 40k minimum and reserved. I invested the rest of my SA lets say 50k in short maturity assets. At 55 20k from OA + 40k from SA goes into RA. SA is then closed. I liquidate the 50k which goes into OA. Can i withdraw the 50k in cash?,btohqsg
"Incorrect assumption in the last part ""I liquidate the 50k which goes into OA.""Seehttps://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/growing-your-savings/cpf-investment-schemes/what-happens-to-my-cpfis-sa-after-my-special-account-is-closed",btohqsg
I see  so hitting frs is non negotiable,btohqsg
"Not sure what exactly you mean by ""non negotiable""  there's nothing that forces you to hit the FRS if you cannot make it with OA+RA",btohqsg
I think his plan is to keep money in OA after liquidation of investment.. he do not want to transfer to RA. Unfortunately   that will not work...,btohqsg
I just transferred OA to SA in Jan so to hit FRS.. But now with this cpf changes  is my move a bad move already? I am below 55,btohqsg
Isn't frs a combination of OA and SA? So you need to manually transfer to SA to officially hit the frs?,btohqsg
FRS is the amount in SA.. I did the transfer myself so as to hit FRS faster n earning higher interest,btohqsg
Why is it a bad move? You will be earning extra 1.5% in SA.,btohqsg
If you didn't need the amount sitting in OA (to use for housing  etc.)  then it's okay to move it to SA to earn more interest.Anyway now that you've hit FRS in SA and if you're still receiving employee/employer contributions + CPF interest  when you reach 55 your SA will be above the FRS  so the extra amount that will transfer back to OA which is higher than what you would have had if you left the funds in OA.,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply! Oh yes at 55 still allow to transfer back to OA.. property prices really high nowadays so I probably got to wait awhile more to get property,btohqsg
Property prices cuts both ways though…when you sell high you also need to buy high  same for when prices are low.But I think now also considering the higher interest rates (although they’re coming down a bit somewhat) it’s not a great time to be moving,btohqsg
Any idea if I'm still eligible for SC CNY promo  if I proceed to sign a new SC CC before opening the Bonsaver account?,btohqsg

no strategy and not topup regularly to any OA/SA/MA  still < 5 years old,btohqsg
I don’t think (I may be wrong)  that if you already topped up RA to ERS at 55  you can then withdraw the difference in ERS vs BRS in full later.The principle of hitting ERS means you’ll need to manually transfer from FRS to ERS at RA. That transferred amount will be reserved and paid out via CPF Life. You can still pledge property to withdraw difference between FRS & BRS but the difference between ERS & FRS is reserved.,btohqsg

Just opened UOB One account last month. Can I check  if I have clocked $500 spend using UOB Lady for Feb  thereafter received refund for transactions posted in Jan  the tracker will be adjusted  i.e. I need to spend again to hit $500? As after my refund is in  the tracker shows that I no longer hit $500 spend despite the refund was from Jan transaction.,btohqsg

Hi Gurus  I opened SC bonus saver account last Nov. but I received my salary via paynow NRIC from cooperate. Is that possible to get salary interest?,btohqsg
Refunds will be counted on the statement month that you're currently on. If you don't spend in Feb  your refund in Feb for a Jan's transaction will be counted in Feb and brings the current spending to negative.,btohqsg
Hi  I have some money inside my amaze wallet  due to refunds. Is it possible to use my amaze wallet alongside amaze card to pay credit card bill via AXS? are there any additional fees that will be incurred from amaze?,btohqsg

hi Melvyn..does the negative roll over to month of march? assuming end of feb.. still negative..,btohqsg
Hi  I have negative credit card balance in my OCBC account due to a refund. Can I withdraw that balance? Would it effect my credit score and be treated as cash advance? Would refund from another card lead to miles cashback? Thanks inadvance,btohqsg
Do you mean credit card  rather than account? (negative on bank account usually means you withdrew more money than you have  which is a bad sign),btohqsg
1. Refund would probably trigger a points clawback2. Negative on your card in this case means there’s money put into the card  not the other way around. So no concerns about being treated as cash advance or similar3. Personally I would just continue spending on that card as per normal to draw down on that surplus  might be more troublesome to try and transfer/withdraw it out,btohqsg
The refund was from another card via amaze.I booked a airbnb with Solitaire and subsequently it refunded back to amaze. I failed to took note that the refund went to OCBC. Would OCBC miles still be clawbacked if the source of the refund was from another card?,btohqsg
Can I check. Wat happens if the mcc code is not 1 of  the codes within the uob lady card categories? U simply don't get the 6pmd? Tis 5310.code doesn't fall in both Grocery or Family,btohqsg
If it doesnt fit the definition of the bonus categories  you don’t get the bonus. Simple as that,btohqsg
Get both at the same time. you will earn NTB for both which was what i did. For starters  always go with low lying fruit  easy to hit signing miles etc .. After which  plan according to specialised spending to continue the miles chasing journey ..,btohqsg
Submit as new application from website,btohqsg
that's interesting. how did you apply for both at the same time? Like was it you sat and applied for one then the other one immediately in one sitting?,btohqsg
Is HSBC black rock worth investing?,btohqsg
Applied online one after another ...it was fast and approved n acouple of days,btohqsg
Recently  I've been trying to build a miles CC stack but my application got rejected by Citibank and HSBC. I am wondering if there are any hacks/tips to go about that? Or any other miles card to recipe d or consider?I am self-employed  income is not an issue for me but I have only been working for ~ 11 months. My UOB credit cards only got approved because I have an account with them. Currently have UOB ladyAlso just kinda concerned if my credit score would be affected due to these rejections.,btohqsg
You already received sign up bonus for both?,btohqsg
I'm using UOB Lady which capped at 1k for 6mpd per month  the refund won't impact the miles I'm earning this month right? While the miles given last month will be clawed back due to refund  I will still get miles for the $500 spent this month right (even though the tracker no longer show $500 spent)?,btohqsg
I tried to apply for Syfe account and submitted my IC and used Singpass for the account setup  but it has been 1 week and it’s still under review is this normal ?,btohqsg
Have you updated your income with UOB?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  for HSBC Revolution  May I know if there was any change in the conversion rate?I thought it was 400 points = $1Why now 280 points = $1?They buffer the rate? 🤔,btohqsg
I tried to find but can’t find the official announcement link. Anyone knows where to find the info?,btohqsg
Hi anyone  if my uob lady is dining category  do I get $1(6miles) when I use xnap in some food stalls?,btohqsg

Anyone had trouble with using SC smart credit card to take mrt? First time using  can tap in but cant tap out. Went to service counter  the person tell me this cc cannot use  but i tot simplygo is one of the reward category for this card? Not sure if the person anyhow say or wat 🤔,btohqsg
Does this work for vouchers at the rewards page too?Ie I can buy vouchers at the promo rate if 280 points per $1,btohqsg
It stated there  if you redeem  HSBC Reward Points for cash credit,btohqsg
Okie. Let’s say if I redeem all my points  but I don’t have any spendings to pay for for the previous month  will this result in a positive credit to my card?Or I can only the use points to offset what is already spent?,btohqsg
Hi I have a question on the uob one debit Mastercard. I used to perform transactions on Monday with credit card transactions to charity donation portal. The Uob one debit card did show the transaction posted successfully on Tuesday. But till then  I have not see it count against the $500 spending requirement in the account interest tracker. For sure  it will not get interest but I just want to count in the $500 spending requirement. There is nothing in T&C saying it will be excluded except for interest counting.,btohqsg
Donations not counted as eligible spend,btohqsg
Understood. Thanks. I tot it is only excluded for interest computation,btohqsg
Easiest way to meet quota for eligible spend is to buy physical NTUC vouchers from the aunty.,btohqsg
Hi can i ask for government and insurance will be excluded as well? Ex: road tax,btohqsg
Of course these are not eligible spend,btohqsg
But u buying every month to hit $500? I am trying to see how to hit the min spending as well,btohqsg
Of coz not. I can hit the Min soend so I don’t need to buy vouchers every month.Don’t get a min spend card if u can’t easily meet the Min though,btohqsg
Insurance is ok  not included for CC cashback,btohqsg
Yap. I thinking of that too. Groceries  utilities and teleco bills I computed can almost reached the $500 requirement. But to be sure  I will use my insurance to cover the “last mile. thanks for the advice,btohqsg
What is the best single credit card strategy to use in 2024Using mostly for ride hailing (grab  gojek  Ryde  tada  comfort taxi)Food delivery (foodpanda  grabfood  Macs)Digital subscription (Netflix  Disney+  Spotify  YouTube Premium)Pls advise.Thank you 🙏☺️,btohqsg
Yup that why I still thinking should I get this uob one account.. I asked uob staff at branch which plans eligible for CC spent but didn't get a good reply though,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website can propose a list of best credit cards to use based on merchant or mcc code. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
So far it recommends Citi Rewards  HSBC Revo and SC Smart CCs,btohqsg
HSBC Revo??🤔 can this be used in your single credit card strategy?,btohqsg
hi  does anyone know if a msian can open a bank account in sg without a valid pass,btohqsg
I am using my card to consolidate the household expense (telco  utilities  dining) except grocery shopping which I use Trust card. Plus a bit from insurance expense and I was able to hit the $500 requirement. The good thing is these household expense will also generate bonus interest for you.,btohqsg
would you recommend DCS Ultimate Platinum CC ?,btohqsg
Is it a good time to convert HSBC revolution points to cash instead of miles?,btohqsg
Given that now 280 points=$1  saved 120 points,btohqsg
280 pts = 112 miles  0.89 cents per mile,btohqsg
I m not familiar with DCS card.,btohqsg
So tempting to convert into cash,btohqsg
Not a good value for me  but ymmv,btohqsg
Any promotion if convert into miles?,btohqsg
It is what it says on the box.Aside  there are many considerations  how much you spend monthly  whether you prefer cashback or miles... etc. Typically  if you only use one card  the cashback/mpd might not be so high,btohqsg
I prefer cashback. I spend 1K a month,btohqsg
DBS WWMC  not sure if digital subscription included.,btohqsg
Citi smrt  citi rewards  uob ppv,btohqsg
Hi all  is it advisable to get into any investment plans with an FA? If not  what other solutions are there that is simple and straight forward for normal folks? My sibling is being sold a plan and idk how to convince otherwise because my personal method is investing in US market which is not the most convenient.,btohqsg
Not a FA  but pls don't get them. I suggest taking a look at endowus very straightforward and easy user interface. U can use CPF  SRS and cash.,btohqsg
Invest in US market is also quite painless and cheap with endowus  just search lion global fund (spy500) or similar funds like amundi prime usa fund.,btohqsg
Why msian without a valid pass which is visitor pass will have the need to open a bank account in sg?,btohqsg
my aunt is no longer a PR  so she has to take back her cpf. but she doesnt want to take her money back to msia,btohqsg
I think can try go bank counter query and give such details,btohqsg
Local banks normally need a valid pass.. but if she Maybank account in Malaysia   maybe can check with Maybank in SG.,btohqsg
Maybank and OCBC allows as long you have Malaysian passport.UOB and DBS confirm cannot.,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I create krisflyer account for my child and linked to my account then  where to check the miles credited to my child and parental controls?,btohqsg
Simplest argument to convince against ILP with FA is to look at the fund-level and management fees being charged,btohqsg
It’s not showing under transfer miles section?,btohqsg
Is this the one you’re referring to?,btohqsg
There’s a min amount to invest?,btohqsg
Still within free-look period? If yes  suggest to cancel first.,btohqsg
If u are using endowus... Suggest u compare with amundi fund ... Compare the fund mgmt fees that u are paying,btohqsg
Ohh seems like they’re investing in the same funds but different holding %. Though the fees are a lot lower,btohqsg
Yea .... Fees eat into your profits,btohqsg
UOB EVOL reset based on calendar month?,btohqsg
Hi all  for CRMC  is it i sum up all my transactions for that statement month and x10? Need to round off the final value or anything? I am not able to tally the points,btohqsg
Any hacks to save on fees ?,btohqsg
Different way to calculate  for individual transactions  round down to nearest dollar & sum all up. Then X10,btohqsg
Anyone still not getting the uob fresh fund reward? Transfer out on the 30/12. And transfer in on 1/1. I have filled the form and maintain the required amount. Still not getting it? Anything i did wrong?,btohqsg
They still have 5 more days to do so..,btohqsg
Received a msg saying my account has not been funded with the participating amount. Called the hotline and mentioned i have properly done and just wait. Got really confused.,btohqsg
What time did you transfer out,btohqsg
If i failed. Can i redo it by transferring out on 28/2 and transfer in on 1/3?,btohqsg
What time. Or easier  what does it say on your app? Transferred on 2 Jan or 30 Dec?,btohqsg
What if my order is less than $1? Then no points😂,btohqsg
So how much % cash back would this promo rate be then?,btohqsg
10/280 = up to 3.57%  not including another 1% from hsbc ega everyday+ rewards,btohqsg
Got it thank you. That is tempting given my primary miles pool is in UOB and HSBC has a chance of being orphaned. Thank you@trazora,btohqsg

?? Why buy gold at Malaysia,btohqsg
Assuming the difference is 1% between with n without amaze  you earn 2000 miles more by paying S$20.value of miles = $20/2000 = 1 cpm. From here you can make your own decision.,btohqsg
