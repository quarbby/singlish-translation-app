I realised that you mentioned in lot videos about cards with high minimum spending like $600-$800.Do you think you can make a video about how to use ipaymy or cardup to hit that minimum spending every week without calculating much.?,btohqsg
Yeah let me research on ipaymy and cardup stuff first. Because I'm not a user yet  though i already have the accounts,btohqsg
Yeah. this one probably take a long time to make video about it.,btohqsg
I see that we cant use grabpay mastercard to pay for other credit card bills through AXS. Any work around so i can get the 1.7% frm the UOB absolute?,btohqsg
Thinking of pairing DBS WWMC & Amaze for an upcoming USD transaction  will dbs consider this as online or overseas transaction ?,btohqsg

Hi Chris! One of the advice you shared was to top up MA to BHS first so that the excess contribution to MA will overflow to SA (if SA has not hit FRS).Can I ask - instead of topping up MA to BHS  why can‚Äôt I top up $8k directly to SA  since SA and MA share the same interest rate of 4%  and since the $8k tax relief is shared between RSTU and VCMA? I.e. if i top up $1k to MA to max to BHS so the excess can flow to SA  and the remaining $7k to SA - why can‚Äôt I just top up $8k to SA directly?,btohqsg
There's actually a lot of thought behind this but i'll simplify here,btohqsg
1) it is easier to hit BHS ($66K) than FRS ($192K)2) More uses of MA (pay medical insurance) instead of SA3) VCMA funds are not reserved for RA  meaning it can be shielded. RSTU-SA funds are reserved for RA  cannot be shielded4) Once MA is maxed at BHS  Contributions to MA will overflow to SA (Super charged SA).then once SA is maxed at FRS  contributions to MA overflows to OA (Supercharged OA),btohqsg
Like now my SA reached FRS and MA reached BHS  31% of my income goes into OA  useful for investing and housing6% continues to go into SA,btohqsg
Thank you  Chris!! Very concise and helpful :),btohqsg

For those who are asking about Singlife  My personal opinion is that it is not worth it for 1%.Spend more time with credit card strategies which can save you even more money. Even like the latest Standard Chartered Bank account promo that can net you $250 easilyhttps://bit.ly/sgbonussaver,btohqsg
Just to put things in perspective. 1% annualized means 0.08% per month. Can you do better than 0.08% using cashback credit cards (Almost guaranteed returns as well)? Definitely  although it is not a true apple to apple comparison but you get my point.,btohqsg

One thing is cpf doesn't segregate this amount seperately under SA unless one keep tracks how much they use RTSU vs VCMA,btohqsg
Once we meet FRS and BHS  only MA will overflow to OA right? SA will keep on adding right?,btohqsg
Yes. Mandatory contribution to SA will still go into SA. Correct me if I'm wrong.,btohqsg
i think after meet BHS will flow to SA ?https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/infohub/cpf-clarifies/policy-faqs/after-i-have-met-the-basic-healthcare-sum-why-do-the-excess-medisave-account,btohqsg
