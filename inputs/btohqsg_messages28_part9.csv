For Feb 2025 bro project  how to know who h is standard  prime and plus?,btohqsg
It is based on locations. Plus/Prime locations is like Rochor  Queenstown  Kallang/Whampoa  Bukit Merah  AMK. Generally they'll indicate which project is under Standard  Prime or Plus.,btohqsg
I think will announce once ready for application,btohqsg
I am an Indian applying for 2 room  in Taman Jurong Skyline.My queue is 3xx.How does the ethnic quota affect me.Will I not be allocated a unit?,btohqsg
My queue number is 3xx out of 549,btohqsg
You should be able to get a unit. Ethnic quota is applicable to the blocks as well so if thereâ€™s a popular block  then you might be restricted if quota for Indian is finish for that particular block.,btohqsg
Thanks for your response.In which way HDB will restrict me. Will HDB not allow me to choose a unit.I was under the impression that ethnic quota has been taken into consideration before allocating the queue number.,btohqsg
During appointment if youâ€™re choosing a unit from a block that quota for Indian is used up  then officer will advise you have to choose from another block,btohqsg
Yea  will be announced in time,btohqsg

Morning!! Does anyone know about Grove springs @ yishun?,btohqsg
Definitely more than 50.On the assumption there are 5 counters operating.I am sure over the 8 hours of working each counters can attend to at least 10 applicants.,btohqsg
Depends how much time is spent for each applicant,btohqsg
Lunch time for the counter staff,btohqsg
i dont think will be >50 since theres also selection ongoing for other launches,btohqsg
start of selections might have lesser appointments compared to nearing end of selections,btohqsg

hi any thoughts for bto 4rm ballot no. 349/260?,btohqsg
Hmm.. hard to say.. got chance if youâ€™re not choosy on the units. But if popular project  the dropout rate would be low. Den maybe apply for Febâ€™s.,btohqsg
Go apply for FEB 2025 launch. Out of Q just apply next Launch.Nowadays drop out rate not v high due to once called up must select if not drop to 2nd timer unless less than 10 units balance then can appeal,btohqsg
hey all  I just received an email from HDB to select the unit for Yishun BTO (June)  and I need to select next year January. But I already got the queue number for the October AMK BTO and the selection starts from April. Am I able to skip for the Yishun project and go for the AMK project?,btohqsg
Can we make an appeal to waive non-selection count?,btohqsg
If there are fewer than 10 units -> can get waiver of non selection penalty and choose not to selectIf no more ethnic quota -> no issues  go ahead and wait for AMKIf 10 or more units -> sorry you have to select.So monitor the units left :) head to the Chencharu hills group chat unit tracker to monitor,btohqsg
what happens if i just don't attend for yishun  what will happen to the AMK proj,btohqsg
If 10 or more units  non selection penalty will apply -> all projects will be canceled and you will be considered a 2nd timerSo AMK will be cancelled,btohqsg
Hi may i know if i just received appointment date for yishun and then i got ballot queue number for jurong . Can i not come for the yishun appointment?,btohqsg
Hello  those kenna called for selection must go !!! If not they will automatically cancelled your other applications!!! And u will become 2nd timer for 1yr.So please go down to your appointment even u have other Q number.If less than 10 units can don't select and appeal to waived non selectionIf more than 10 units u must choose and give up your other Q numbers if u never choose means downgrade to 2nd timer for 1yr and also hdb will cancel all other ONGOING applications,btohqsg
That's is why many ppl pray hard don't be called up when out of Q,btohqsg
U can't skip yishun unfortunately as u are called to select. U never go   hdb will automatically cancel your AMK application,btohqsg
shag nvm uh  we are going to select yishun flat anyways. Thanks!,btohqsg
If u go to select and below 10 units balance u can don't select and appeal to retain your AMK Q,btohqsg
If is above 10 units then u have to choose or don't choose and become 2nd timer for a yr with ongoing application cancelled,btohqsg
