Solid work only 10 mil shares on T+4 where T was 70 mil shares. Whoever bought $0.004 and $0.005 holding it.Also  $0.004/$0.005 maintained. Times have changed for HSO. 4 is the base,btohqsg
Can’t wait for land travel to open. Maybe limited to certain numbers daily.,btohqsg
is SG ready for 200k - 300k travelers via land per day?,btohqsg
In the past 2 years  3 directors (2 seems to be from HK Team And 1 from sg) along with 1 upper management (Wong Ben Koon Brother who is COO) from Wong’s HK team has left .,btohqsg
While in the same period 2020 to 2021  3 persons (Bruneians/working in Brunei) have joined the board .,btohqsg
For those who don’t see it   this is likely a power shift and transfer from the HK to the Bruneians.Kind of obvious now.Soon  I believe there will be no more Gloria Wong . Her dad no longer has the shares to help her.That’s why the HK one by one getting out . Even Linda Kwan who was happily drawing 250k yearly is out.,btohqsg
People leave / get voted out or resign when their ship is sinking.Wong Ben Koon is leaving his ship.Brunei Prince 👑 engineering this transition to his team now.If not why only now  he start putting his guys in?He was chairman since 2014.For me  interesting times indeed. Hope he help unlock the value,btohqsg

I done my homework.Funding into Gemini is cheapest via fast ibanking.  Because it’s fast ibanking  no fee. It will be sgd for u to buy eth. Then from eth u can sell to usd and buy other coins. Rate very good. Less than 5mins money funded. And cashing out also. Use singpass to register will get approval extremely fast when signing up. Use the free pro trading (cheap maker and taker fee) on desktop  don’t use mobile swap (fee high)Next is funding into coinlist via silvergate using dbs oversea remit (bank rate). Takes couple of working days depending on which day of the week u do funding. Last time I fund thru silvergate for binance com. Until silvergate stop their operation with binance comMost expansive is p2p because of the rate of currency conversion (worst then bank rate). Need kyc with buyer and seller sometimes  key in their phone number/bank details etc which takes 30mins. The rate get extremely bad when everyone rush to cash in or cash out like panic sell off etc. can compare to current bank forex rate by checking your dbs remit for the rateLet me know if u need help cheers. These days more active in crypto than stock. Crypto guru liao lol 😂 need more details let me know. I am using at least 7 different platforms. Each have their own advantage like coinlist give u chance to ido  coinbase give u free crypto just by learning about them.One thing to note in crypto: never do future and margin (whales 🐳 like to liquidate both long and short position instantly (like within 30mins)  before pumping up,btohqsg
“2 companies that areMASregulated that would make you feel safer are Gemini and Coinhako” quoted from seedly,btohqsg
Which is why u can use singpass on gemini,btohqsg
