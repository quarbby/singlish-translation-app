"Have you noticed that a *Bronze* medalist is generally *more happy* than a *Silver medalist* at the end of the game.It’s not an incidental finding but a proven fact in many research studies after studying reactions of silver medalists vs bronze medalists!Ideally  a silver medalist should be more happy than the bronze. But  the human mind doesn't work like mathematics.This happens because of a phenomenon called the *counterfactual thinking*.The silver medalist thinks  ""Oh I couldn't win the gold medal."" The bronze medalist thinks  ""At least I got a medal.""A silver medal is won after losing  but a bronze medal is won after winning.This happens even in our life  we don't appreciate what we have but feel sad with what we don't have. Let's be grateful for our blessings  they far outweigh our problems if we start counting.Life is after all full of choices  do always count your blessings to stay positive & motivated.",btohqsg
