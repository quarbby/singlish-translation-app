Ah thanks   jung hon is my saviour today,btohqsg

As long as nobody is a serial killer,btohqsg
lmfao serial killers be getting advanced with their techniques these days lol,btohqsg

idm igare we starting one on ws or tele?,btohqsg
im starting one on ws but im asking@sushjamif they wanna start one also on tele,btohqsg
One is enough anywhere   wither ws or tele,btohqsg
says the one who suggested the group in the first place 🙄,btohqsg
The commoners suggest a lot of things   but it's the king who takes charge !,btohqsg
I banned a lot of people,btohqsg
But those were like people who advertise la,btohqsg
Woops  let's change that  jung hon is our king   all hail jung hon,btohqsg
tbh I think our discord has something like this,btohqsg
In a study group? Wow   that's bold of them,btohqsg
Yes I know discord has many study groups   just that my phone hangs so much on discord,btohqsg
There are people who do that,btohqsg
And I don't have a laptop,btohqsg
Discord is like the dark Web,btohqsg
discord is great and all but yea could get pretty laggy on my side too,btohqsg
It's dark and it's the Web,btohqsg
im in so many servers that i'll probably get distracted like shet,btohqsg
But for people with laptops discord is great for study groups though   I know one study group where there are like 10000 members,btohqsg
There are 1000 people studying always on cam,btohqsg
They have duo groups where two people can study together,btohqsg
like i said  any smaller grps tht i cn jusidkbe at v least chill with first,btohqsg
Look at all these people Studying,btohqsg
sure i send no. to u or my man jam,btohqsg
They also have like stats   and there are a few persons who study for like 400 hours a month,btohqsg
then again ik a guy who thinks 12h of studying isn't enough,btohqsg
😭😭 how do people even do that,btohqsg
bruh i kinda wish i hv tht much discipline,btohqsg
Or maybe they just sit infront of the book and make up stories in their mind for 12 hours,btohqsg
but he did train himself ig,btohqsg
nah i know him q wellhe's sibei guai 😭,btohqsg
Glad to see SGExams discord isn’t only the bunch of weirdos sitting deafened in a discord voice channel,btohqsg
how does studying in discord study groups even work tho,btohqsg
like other than using bots to remind or wtv,btohqsg
A lot of talk from the admin of a dying tele group chat!!,btohqsg
Die faster then I can run away,btohqsg
They just sit in a voice channel muted,btohqsg
I guess it’s nice to know that someone on the other side of the screen is studying too,btohqsg
some dedication and discipline they have,btohqsg
Why you Asians are so obbssed with studying,btohqsg
if you're not asian or sporean or pr  then why are you judging,btohqsg
if you are  why are you still judging,btohqsg
I am an American  Anglo by blood,btohqsg
i mean  most of us are conservative and traditional when it comes to studying so,btohqsg
Well we anglos did most of the inventions and advancements  however not all of us are so obbssed with studying,btohqsg
we're not necessarily obsessedwe need the practice tho,btohqsg
why do you think we asians only are the ones obsessed with studying?,btohqsg
we're not really that sorta case :/,btohqsg
America is the richest country on earth  most white people are not so obsessed with studying and getting  high marks tho  anyone can do it. It doesn't showcases the real creativity.,btohqsg
"i don't think obsessed is really the right word tooafter all  it's not ""asians""it's just singaporeans are pretty much forced into this education system and are labelled one of the well known & ""better"" systems",btohqsg
Everything around you was created by a white men.,btohqsg
suppose you see the education difference between singapore and america  you wouldn't be surprised with the attitude difference,btohqsg
"Also  grammar it's either ""by white men"" or "" by a white man"". Pick one.",btohqsg
what is this now? racism? white supremacy?,btohqsg
surely the main method but no  not everything is by a white man.,btohqsg
Ok  Sir Stamford Raffles  I'm going to have to stop you right there.,btohqsg
i don't mean to hate but yeah,btohqsg
earns a chuckle frm me ngl HAHAH,btohqsg
Asians were brutally mogged by the whites,btohqsg
i'm sure you have the wrong word,btohqsg
what in the hell is mog,btohqsg
that earned a laugh from me,btohqsg
Umm  no. The concepts you guys used were laid upon by people of other ethnicities.,btohqsg
the whites have had their advances  their impacts  but in the end  do you see the line that draws between asians and americans since you bring that specific nationality,btohqsg
"Well  we are moving away from the notion that the British guy ""founded"" us so yeah.",btohqsg
Believe anything you want  but don't say that racist here,btohqsg
I'm not undermining your contributions  thank you for being a beneficial race to society  but to fully assert your dominance for your contributions when you utilised concepts from other ethnicities is just an egoistical statement to make.,btohqsg
agreements made with all these statements,btohqsg
hahahaha did we chase them off,btohqsg
Let's move on to happier topics!,btohqsg
thursday is usually the longest day afterall,btohqsg
Oh my  please take care and stay hydrated  alright!,btohqsg
thursday?? i beg to differ 😭,btohqsg
monday will frever be my longest day in a week,btohqsg
Lol no  what concepts you talking about? White men created everything,btohqsg
Forever is such a mighty long time.,btohqsg
I was considering doing that myself bit I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt,btohqsg
Ah  I see  well do take a wonderful break for the evening alright!,btohqsg
I’ve seen enough trolls on discord,btohqsg
and forever will remain my stand,btohqsg
hi  anyone here really good in english?,btohqsg
was about to listen in only to hear racism coming out the other end huh,btohqsg
You got this  chap  I believe in you!,btohqsg
I need tips on how to improve a script I wrote,btohqsg
i wouldn't claim that i am but i'm generally gd!,btohqsg
Maybe that American lady we just kicked since it's her language?,btohqsg
we can probs help if you send it,btohqsg
I'm not even trying to be funny but hey,btohqsg
it's natural and that's great ;),btohqsg
laughter is afterall the best medicine,btohqsg
How I wish that is true for COVID but we can't have everything in life.,btohqsg
This is why you study guys,btohqsg
Yeah  putting a smile on others is great.,btohqsg
So that you don't spew out racist bullshit,btohqsg
whole time she was babbling i was thinking why is she in thisstudychat group then,btohqsg
If we all just heed to her words,btohqsg
The radicalisation could have been real,btohqsg
Ah  just the thought alone irks me.,btohqsg
My apologies  guys  the story of the radicalised 16 year old still lingers in my mind.,btohqsg
well don't because i'm sure all of us aren't surprised to hear that there's DEFINITELY more than a thousand out there thinking like so,btohqsg
The 16 year who planned on trying to re-enact the Christchurch shootings on 2 mosques here in Singapore.,btohqsg
??!?!?? why have i not heard of this,btohqsg
Al Jazeera English: Singapore teenager arrested for plotting attack on Muslims.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/27/singapore-arrests-teenager-for-plotting-attacks-against-muslims,btohqsg
I wish it was fake news but nope.,btohqsg
where they even get all the money and resources to plan the attack one,btohqsg
He was trying to livestream it like the actual attack.,btohqsg
I still have sleepless nights after that revelation.,btohqsg
don't mind me: what the fuck,btohqsg
huh say what china and south Korea r way worse than sg...,btohqsg
i mean  i did said one of the education systemsdidn't rly say it was tiring or bad of a system,btohqsg
Can someone send me the holy grail docs link again?,btohqsg
Uhhh the drive w all the notes thingy,btohqsg
..weell i meant likeno choice maeducation is must is what i meant hehh,btohqsg
anyway it's only compulsory up to p6,btohqsg
u can quit sch after that if u want,btohqsg
Anybody got that link for GP papers??,btohqsg
ehh discipline would prob be best attribute to hve then,btohqsg
ah  i searched Google and they say 6 years compulsory education oni,btohqsg
mmlike most ppl tho  btr to just finish the education journey LOL,btohqsg
im gonna wait till next yr to see whether gon' drop out or not,btohqsg
im just p much lost in my studies anyways,btohqsg
It's not rly that fun when u self study :'),btohqsg
And don't forget U nid pay for Ur own exam fees,btohqsg
And over 10k++ for classes 🙃 so not rly worth it,btohqsg
I drop out aft n levels finish,btohqsg
Don't wanna stay in toxic environment,btohqsg
in your honest opinion  was that(dropping out) worth it tho?,btohqsg
Ye but there was one website catering specifically to GP,btohqsg
I paid like 80% of it tho,btohqsg
I like to say my school has a lot of retards but it’s still bearable and eve enjoyable,btohqsg
Ah that's not as bad as mine :>,btohqsg
btw did anyone here take that?,btohqsg
kinda wna know if it's worth a shot for uni,btohqsg
havent heard of anyone that done that but am thinking of taking h2 math as priv candidate,btohqsg
I know of one that done that in this grp,btohqsg
But I can't tag him :>,btohqsg
You need to take it with 2 other H2s and GP if u want to use it to go to uni  by the way,btohqsg
only reason i may take it is to support for my crypto,btohqsg
to boast to others that they get As for 11 years straight,btohqsg
why did ppl tell me hving a lvl results help with going into uni a lot easier?,btohqsg
or is it right but i'm getting some concept wrong here,btohqsg
if you have a full set of results,btohqsg
U can’t just partially do A levels,btohqsg
i dn think i wld jus take partialyeah i wld plan to straight up take the entire thing for the sake of this pathway,btohqsg
PW not required for private candidates,btohqsg
H1 mt don’t need to do well,btohqsg
has anyone done that bfore ? and can they tell me if it's worth it,btohqsg
It doesn’t factor into the rank points,btohqsg
as in like the taking up a lvls on the side   to get into uni easier,btohqsg
My A level Chinese is like E for paper and distinction for oral,btohqsg
If u r already in poly or something  just focus on poly to get into uni,btohqsg
for US unis SAT is more impt right?,btohqsg
not yet  still taking o lvls this yr lol,btohqsg
The best H1 MT grade is S because it shows you put the least amount of effort for the most amount of reward,btohqsg
I always tot u in poly or smth,btohqsg
if you going a non jc path  please don't do a lvls on the side,btohqsg
Cuz u talk abt poly like most of the time,btohqsg
:****) gona cry bc i strongly decide on not going to jcbut i'm scared that i won't be able to get into a uni i want to end up in,btohqsg
where do you want to end up in?,btohqsg
idk man there are ppl who consider it,btohqsg
But it’s not a well known path,btohqsg
Not well known as in you won’t be able to find much info about it,btohqsg
do you know anyone who did a full a levels privately will studying full time?,btohqsg
didn't do too much digging into unisbut mainly psychology/neurology (if hve) if i manage a course like that in poly,btohqsg
Oh I tot is business HAHAH,btohqsg
anyway psychology is not an extremely difficult course to get in,btohqsg
rip  what if it's just under researcher instead of actually being involved  in that side of things,btohqsg
plus suss has part time psychology,btohqsg
ehhhh neurology is under medicine la,btohqsg
so most probably still need study medicine,btohqsg
not unless u do maybe like life science or something,btohqsg
So you not only need to do medicine   you need to specialize in internal medicine and then superspecialize in neurology,btohqsg
as u can tell   mainly just looking into mental health / biology so yeahwhatever in that sort  i wouldn't rly mind studying or working my ass off for it,btohqsg
u need to do general stuff too haha,btohqsg
singapore field q small  might want to consider overseas,btohqsg
i did once but i am rly contemplating the costs going into that thought,btohqsg
And neurology deals less with mental health but more with diseases related to brain   if you are into  treating mental health  psychiatry is the one   but that requires medical school as well,btohqsg
If you just wanna be a therapist z then you can go for psychology,btohqsg
i'm interested in both topics so either way i'm pretty happy if i get into one or the other,btohqsg
really? smu offers it to non-sci student too lol,btohqsg
Well I'd you decided on going to mefschool   then you better get your ass to focus not on studies but on self discipline first,btohqsg
issit  frm what i heard need med sch first  then can go psychiatry as an addon,btohqsg
"attacking me first-hand already upon getting to know me is one way to wake me the hell up :"")",btohqsg
Yup psychology can give therapy sessions and counselling though,btohqsg
a lot lot more int in mental health / psychology  anyone got suggestions on that?,btohqsg
singaporeans mental health all fucked 😂,btohqsg
exactly why i motivated LOLconsidering i'm involved oso,btohqsg
not easy to do psychology tho,btohqsg
is ok we dont need to fix it,btohqsg
if everybody has the same problem  it isn't a problem - society,btohqsg
ok if you want to be in the mental health space: counsellor  clinical psychologist  psychiatrist,btohqsg
counsellor and clinical psychologist need masters,btohqsg
"I once had a person who didn't wanna study with me cause I wasn't ""white enough "" and so I was not pleasant to the eyes to look at while studying 🤣🤣",btohqsg
psychiatrist need med sku plus further studies,btohqsg
ive heard that a hundred times or more but ive had personal occurrences enough to drive me just about barely sane to get there,btohqsg
yeah  i think motivation is key,btohqsg
Have you ever flipped through the pages of your JAE booklet and found an interesting subject you’ve never heard about? Something new that you would like to find out more about  but don’t know how? 🤔Tribute Thursday Introduces “Subjects of Interest” - a series of articles on the “elective” H2 subjects of Further Math  English Language and Linguistics  and Computing. The series will shed some light on these unique subjects that students might have questions about! 🤩We kick off with Further Math (also known as F-Math)  a subject that seems quite daunting at first glance - but could possibly be the right subject for you.Read the full article on our Medium:medium.com/SGExams.,btohqsg
was abt to take it if i went jc,btohqsg
"nope  but you'd think i wouldn't have my ass prepared to be working a lot more than i should be rn  :"")yeah money is a huge factor",btohqsg
Don't worry   nothing is too hard to get   as long as you are consistent,btohqsg
You get farther by Studying 3 hours daily for 1 year than studying for 10 hours a day for one month and then not studying the rest of the year,btohqsg
then do well for ur a levels too  and money won't be an issue,btohqsg
i researched abit on that but i'd only be able to gauge only so much based off possible o lvls grades  right?,btohqsg
nah scholarship won't really factor o lvls,btohqsg
ah screw that   i was sarcastic HAHAHAi can't tell bc i haven't even gotten into poly yet,btohqsg
idk what it factors la  but grades do matter for scholarship,btohqsg
see that never goes wrong lol,btohqsg
u planning to go poly psycho course?,btohqsg
but it's good to have one,btohqsg
if you don't know what are the requirements of your goals,btohqsg
you wouldn't know what is needed to get there,btohqsg
imagine u want take med in uni,btohqsg
but knn u go jc take arts stream,btohqsg
well in that case yeah plan is impt,btohqsg
u wan take med apply for art stream?,btohqsg
i didn't expect people to not know? 😂😂,btohqsg
but a lot of ppl go jc also because they no plan hahaha,btohqsg
sounds pretty fun ;)aiyo what the hell,btohqsg
like maybe they r more inclined to sciences,btohqsg
idk what i wanna do too,btohqsg
but even if u don't have a plan,btohqsg
it's better to be hyper aware of all possible options,btohqsg
y'a  maybe aware would be a better word,btohqsg
of which most ppl r not anyway,btohqsg
like I don't even need you to tell me,btohqsg
what you want to be 10 years later,btohqsg
just be aware of what you like,btohqsg
what are your options if u take certain paths,btohqsg
tbf i agree w those factors,btohqsg
they determine n say a lot,btohqsg
i mean is there smtg u rly like,btohqsg
i took arts cuz it's easy to score,btohqsg
but idk what i'm gonna do after i graduate,btohqsg
but at least know what are your options,btohqsg
yeah  i can do everyth  except anyth related to sci in uni,btohqsg
personally since i havent experienced much  i think it's btr tht u know if u dm studying the course & tht u know u can do well in itthn frm thr rank ur options in best to worst i guess,btohqsg
have u seen sgexams subred posts,btohqsg
"""I eae-ed to so and so poly course. 'can someone share what they learn in this course?""",btohqsg
so ppl do stuff without knowing what stuff is,btohqsg
a lotta useful shitand a lotta wellhmmmm,btohqsg
Those graduating from poly  yall choosing to work or continue uni?,btohqsg
continue uni ~ dont think the economy is good enough to go straight to work now,btohqsg
nope im still doing my fyp but im submitting soon!! taking my time w the app form HAHA dont wna screw it up man,btohqsg
Does anyone know if i can still appeal to a jc,btohqsg
they most likely will reject your application hahahaa,btohqsg
Yes but Iike only just started,btohqsg
But those that successfully appealed would've missed orientation too  no?,btohqsg
don't think they'll miss all 3 days?,btohqsg
2 feb is official appeal iirc,btohqsg
oops  they'll miss ah  but orientation is kinda impt,btohqsg
even if dont matter the school dont accept ur appeal u also LLST,btohqsg
so best is to just ask the sch of ur interest,btohqsg
but yes  very unlikely for your appeal to go through lol,btohqsg
appeal period was 28jan to 2feb haha,btohqsg
singapore does things by book  though there are exceptions sometimes,btohqsg

Hi everyone  we'd like to introduce our Online Study Groups! We’ll be hosting small group study sessions on Discord every week  where students can help each other with their studies and homework.From 27 Feb  we’ll be holding the first study groups on a sign-up basis (for now).What is the format? What subjects are you covering?We’ll host sessions based on your preferences. For example  if you indicated interest for A-Level H2 Maths on weekends  we’ll host math sessions on weekends.How is this different from online lessons?Some may feel awkward asking questions in class while others don’t want to be caught mugging. We want to create a chill  judgement-free zone to study and make new friends.How is this different from Telegram?Telegram is text-based. For some  regular calls can better help develop study habits and a sense of community.Is this tuition?No. It’s a peer study group. We’ll have student ICs to guide discussion.Hope to see you there! Sign uphereRules and guidelines,btohqsg

Its been almost a week and they fucking grey ticked me,btohqsg
I need help on this pls,btohqsg
you should report to the authority lol,btohqsg
yasia like there's a law for employees rights protection,btohqsg
Nope it was a one day job i got through an agency  I worked alr but agency said they gon pay me soon up till now havent yet,btohqsg
they should pay you first maan,btohqsg
A few days ago they said they gon give but up till now havent give,btohqsg
did you checked if the account number is the same??,btohqsg
I wld give less shits if my crush did this to me but i need money,btohqsg
Look at me chasing them lol,btohqsg
worse case scenario  they send to another person instead of you,btohqsg
They didnt even ask for my bank acc or wtv even though thats what they said abt salary collection,btohqsg
Im gna try chasing them agn the next work week but if i dont successfully get my deserved pay what shld i do,btohqsg
yaa that is the likely situation here,btohqsg
or go to the agency and demands why they didn't pay you,btohqsg
because it is likely that the agency pays not the client,btohqsg
i believe recruit first might forgot the kinda thing,btohqsg
im not sure they dont seems to be the type to do that shit on purpose,btohqsg
i see their job listings everywhere,btohqsg
maan i did worked for them twice,btohqsg
but ermm i hate them the fact that they redirect the job to something else,btohqsg
like i did applied for admin,btohqsg
and when i go see their office  they asked me to take up a job in gardern by the bay instead,btohqsg
so yaa i hate that part,btohqsg
like something to do with the children's water park,btohqsg
like you just stand there and watch for ill behaviour,btohqsg
tbh ya most recruit agencies do this,btohqsg
but the female manager always give you trouble shit,btohqsg
you can't actually stands  you need to do something,btohqsg
Its pretty much what they do,btohqsg
mhm@meltedmangofrappereporting threatens their licenses and all so they will listen immediately,btohqsg
inform them that report sent to mom too,btohqsg

sometimes the agent is too busy contacting and messaging other ppl most of the time,btohqsg

but LSE stocks generally quite ex,btohqsg
so i reckon ppl will invest in US/AU/SG stocks instead,btohqsg
tbh I'll probably only use LSE for Ireland domiciled ETFs,btohqsg
15% withholding tax instead of 30% keke,btohqsg
idk how it works cos for me i just directly buy US stocks but nvr kenna the 30% tax problem,btohqsg
Woa woa all these stock talks,btohqsg
only on dividends uh not capital gains,btohqsg
but both expense ratio generally the same so I ok w LSE,btohqsg
icic so i guess ibkr is favoured overall cos of that aspect,btohqsg
the stocks i investing no dividends so... :S,btohqsg
Idk i dun invest one hahahaha wobuzhidao bout stocks,btohqsg
bitcoin is the only thing u love ah,btohqsg
haven't explored other ETFs yet oops,btohqsg
