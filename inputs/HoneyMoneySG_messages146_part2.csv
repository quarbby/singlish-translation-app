Ega only 1% Cashback on giro n bonus promo 4% only 2 month and can't participate on the next promo. So what is the interest rate in the EGA acc  0.5%?,btohqsg
Depends on your strategy. What type rewards do you want  can you meet the min spend on the card  etc. Then decide whether you should use card with CardUp or just eGIRO to HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
I find that ega Abit troublesome. Have use giro form to mail n wait . Later nerf again,btohqsg
Definitely eventually will be GIRO to HSBC EGA.But if he doesn't want to earn miles or can't meet min spend for the eligible cashback cards  would be best to eGIRO to HSBC EGA directly.,btohqsg
Egiro can ? I thought must use form to mail. If not considered not eligible under t & c.,btohqsg
Are you mixing up the 2 programmes?HSBC Everyday+ Rewards: 1% Cashback on GIRO and 1% p.a. bonus interest on incremental MAB is 1 month. Can register monthly  but NEED incremental MAB for following month.HSBC EGA Bonus Interest Promo: 3% (Dec 24 promo) p.a. bonus interest on incremental MAB is 2 months. Can register based on your last registration month. 2nd month also earns the bonus interest without additional increment.,btohqsg
Oh thanks  egiro can use on HSBC,btohqsg
eGIRO is not self-initiated bank transfer via GIRO.,btohqsg
Even in person my friends don‚Äôt understand when I explain EGA to them.,btohqsg
Hi  may I know if it‚Äôs still possible to use CardUp with the UOB PRVI Miles Card to pay income tax and earn miles? I noticed in the credit card terms and conditions that UNI$ is not awarded for transactions under MCC 9311 (tax payments).,btohqsg
Cardup will be different mcc but the recent mastercard promo by cardup might not get card reward according to milelion,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know when must you hit the minimum krisflyer uob card $800 minimum spend by to get the 3mpd?,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone know if i use shopback or changi pay to us my dbs woman card. Does it count to online payment?,btohqsg
Yes   confuse on HSBC ega. So is 1 ega account for the 2 program?,btohqsg
To confirm egiro qualifies for ega 1% cashback  is that correct? üòÇü•π,btohqsg
So can I say that for EGA. The base interest is 1%(on 2000 increment per month ) n 1% cash back on giro without the bonus promo. Only when eligible for bonus  promo then have 4%.,btohqsg
Base interest is 0.05%.Bonus interest programmes:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/255060,btohqsg

Hi  I want to buy a $1100 laptop from Harvey Norman. Not sure if I can split payments there but the plan is that. Currently have the CRMC + Amaze combo only and using it to cover $900-$1000 of the cost of the laptop. However  I need another card to cover the remainder cost of the laptop and also a card that has no min. spend as I probably only going to spend $300-$400 before the end of the statement month of my CRMC resets back to $0. Any suggestions on what I should get? Can also serve as a backup card moving forward in the case I spend more than $1000 in certain months. Prefer miles but I don‚Äôt mind cashback too. Any help would be greatly appreciated üôè,btohqsg

Sorry if this as been asked beforeFor optimising max personal CPF tax relief of $37740 for an SEP... is the best option to add VCMA/VC3A $29740  then RSTU $8000?Or is the $37740 cap only for VCMA/VC3A... with a separate tax relief category for RSTU $8k?,btohqsg
VCMA and RSTU different tax relief cap from VC3A.,btohqsg
U can try ask can partial payment then remaining pay liao the collect item haha,btohqsg
so VC3A tax relief cap is $37740?and RSTU+VCMA tax relief cap is $8k?which category does mandatory MA contribution fall into?,btohqsg
Same as VC3A. Under annual tax relief cap. Don't forget the tax relief cap from 37% of assessable income as well.,btohqsg
So an example to max out CPF tax relief for an SEP (assuming no option for spouse/parental top ups) is- Mandatory MA contribution + VC3A to hit $37740- RSTU+VCMA to hit $8000?,btohqsg
Hi  sifu. Is it good to link YouTrip linked to amaze crmc combo or direct crmc instead or POSB everyday card?,btohqsg
never had any experience splitting payments before,btohqsg
you referring to topup youtrip? topup using any mastercard credit card directly  all no rewards anyway,btohqsg
Noticed the BHS increased in 2023 was 3.8%  2024 was 4.3% vs 5.6%  in 2025. In other words ppl who already max out the BHS will also come a point their VCMA top up in Jan can reach 8k 1 day. Not sure if that is good or bad news‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Yes  eventually have to trend with medical cost inflation,btohqsg
Hi guys  I'm researching on using iPayMy to pay Property Tax  and according to the iPayMy website:https://help.ipaymy.com/en/articles/3153490-which-cards-can-earn-rewards-with-ipaymyThere are quite a number of cards that can earn cashback.However  I see that I can't input an Amex Credit Card into iPayMy (so the Amex True Cashback does not seem to be supported).When checking for UOB PRVI Miles VISA  the UOB T&Cs also say that iPayMy is excluded:https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/terms-and-conditions-governing-uob-prvi-miles-card.pdfDoes anyone have any recommendations on what is the best card to use for iPayMy? Thank you.,btohqsg
