Sorry i got confused with the year of assessment and the calendar year which is counted üòÖ it seems that the original assessment in March 2023 was 0  even though i did not change my payment method. So the additional assessment i receive now is for 2022,btohqsg
Beside üç´  HSBC EGA bonus interest also pays up to 4.5% (for deposits up to $360k) from 1 Nov to 31 Dec.,btohqsg

"Thanks. Is it I will be able to see the lump sum payment under ""revenue details""? Will check to see if I get the lump sum payment tmr as it is the 7th business day.",btohqsg

Hi‚Ä¶Does anybody have a promo code to buy Unit Trusts from OCBC?And does buying ‚ÄúINFINITY U.S. 500 STOCK INDEX FUND SGD‚Äù qualify for the ‚ÄúInvest Bonus‚Äù for 360 Account?,btohqsg
May I know where did u read that it is 4.5% for up to $360K? Thanks!,btohqsg
Oh ya i didnt even notice their terms abit different from the past. So to earn the maximum 4.5% (3.5% +1%)  will have to topup between $100k to $360k from 1 Nov onwards. Now deposit don't earn 3.5%,btohqsg
it should be up to 2 million top up compare to sep adb,btohqsg
sms to signup now and top up from 1 nov onward,btohqsg
Additional 1% from HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme's terms and conditions is capped at $300 which equals to deposit equivalent of $360k,btohqsg
if you have 360k  u can opt for premier banking which up to 500 per month,btohqsg
u just need 200k to have a hsbc premier and i believe this promo is target at such customer due to the minimum top up value to be from 100k onwards,btohqsg
Sounds like a lot of money üòÖ,btohqsg
"the 1% only for first mth right? since 2nd mth the amount wont be considered ""incremental"" liao",btohqsg
it is given for month of nov and dec  reference month is sep. So if the monthly adb is 2k in sep  u can top up max 300k excluding any other bill/ giro that also take up the ega cap of 300.,btohqsg
for premier banking would be 15k plus max 500k to get the extra 1 percent per month for everyday 1 percent  excluding bill/giro. so not sure how the 360k is been calculated,btohqsg
Terms and conditions stated for bonus interest  the cap of $300 is applicable for all customers segment. The $500 is referring to the total cashback for premier customers is referring to including cashback for credit card spends and giro.,btohqsg
there was no stated of cap in the tnc i posted before.,btohqsg
so just follow the normal customer cap of 300 and premier customer of 500,btohqsg
ok i saw where u coming from but where does the 360 is been calculated still. with 300k incremental max out the 1 personal and plus the adb in sep,btohqsg
Hope this makes it clear enough for you. Terms and condition is very clear. You have misunderstood,btohqsg
($360000 *0.01) / 12 months = $300 cashback for bonus interest,btohqsg
ok  was focus on the promotion tnc and not the everyday 1 percent. my mistake,btohqsg
Yes the 1% for incremental will only be for Nov as it compare with previous month balance which is Oct. So Dec will compare with Nov But for the 3.5%  both Nov and Dec compares with Sep.Now got 2 terms and conditions to read  so can get abit confusing. ü§£,btohqsg
is the current promo for webull or moomoo better for new users signup  say the amount is around sgd 30k?,btohqsg
How long does moomoo withdrawal take?,btohqsg
Anyone who had registered for the NDP promo have fund in UOB one or stash account earmark?,btohqsg
So to max out this promo  top up 360k will earn me effective 4% pa for Nov and dec rite?  4.5% for nov and 3.5% for dec,btohqsg
1. Is this card only or other cards in your Google Pay also has the same issue?2. Remove the card from your Google pay/wallet and re-add it in. If you can't re-add it  call the bank to request the CSO to re-issue the token for your card for mobile wallets.,btohqsg
Feedback liao but don't see Heymax updates the data also..,btohqsg
I thought the 600 min spend promo ends at Oct. From Nov onwards will go back to 800 min spend?,btohqsg
That 300 and this 300/500 are 2 different things. The first 300 is the addition 1% interest compare to your previous month's ADB. Premier or not max you only can get 300.The other 300/500 is the rebate from your CC spend or GIRO. 300 for normal account  500 for premier.,btohqsg
Thanks for reply  it's ok. I end up using another card. ü§£,btohqsg
