If buy 2nd car  ncd starts from 0 for that car. Any ways to circumvent this problem?,btohqsg
yes  don't buy a second car,btohqsg
How to rental co works? Their nth car also start from 0 ncd?,btohqsg
rental companies have special fleet insurance policies. you as private driver will not have access to such schemes  and they are very expensive anyway,btohqsg
Is it? my insurance agent said ncd built from 0 individually even for rental co,btohqsg
bro..you need to explain your question a little clearer. It sounded like you are asking about how rental companies insure their fleets. Now it sounds like you are asking about rental car,btohqsg
individual ncd is per car as far as i know  whether rental or private. this is for individual normal insurance  i dont know how these private hire schemes work. why dont you call up the rental company and ask them since they have the answer,btohqsg
If buy 2nd car  car n insurance under ur name  follow ur existing ncd,btohqsg
Fleet insurance is lump sum against X number of cars.If u have 100 cars  insurance company will quote u based on these 100 cars.Or they can quote u 200 cars and u slowly add to ur fleet,btohqsg
Start from 0 for that car unless transfer ur 1st car ncd to 2nd car,btohqsg
This is true if you do a transfer of the NCD from your first car to 2nd car rite?Anyway he's referring to rental companies not personal buying.,btohqsg
You've answered your own question 🤣,btohqsg
Try not to do this again,btohqsg
No bro my qns is any ways to circumvent this problem,btohqsg
The only way maybe is to buy fleet insurance,btohqsg
