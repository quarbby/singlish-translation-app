Am waiting for the new Niro Hybrid to be in SG,btohqsg
So far C&C donâ€™t carry them yet,btohqsg
But will probably go for a hybrid if I can afford one in the near future,btohqsg
If you wait a little longer.. EV6,btohqsg
But I think within the next 10 years at least  I wonâ€™t be looking to get a full EV.,btohqsg
Best I will do is a hybrid,btohqsg
From 2030 onwards  maybe Iâ€™ll be considering an EV  but then itâ€™ll depend on the situation of the near future.,btohqsg
Of course  EV is the way to go in the future  but maybe not now.,btohqsg
But yes the EV6 looks absolutely gorgeous.,btohqsg
I drove the Niro EV last month around Jeju for a week! Loved it.,btohqsg
I couldnâ€™t stop looking at it on roads and carparks,btohqsg
maintenance wise is still fairly okay because the E200/230 has many parts lying around. As long as you dont get a lemon  all should be fine,btohqsg
Only downside would be the fuel consumption which is marginal if you  ask me. Even with the increase in fuel prices  when you calculate it as a whole its abt 1-2k diff.,btohqsg
W204 would be better choice ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
i like to believe anybody that wants to upgrade to conti should get a bulletproof conti first,btohqsg
yeah but so many are abused,btohqsg
how many yp u see driving W211,btohqsg
most are all uncle cars which are well taken care of,btohqsg
W212  W204 onwards tend to have electrical issues,btohqsg
u have 96% chance of spotting a yp when u look into an F10 window,btohqsg
I would rather a w211 than a f10 ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
same haha  W211 are cool imo,btohqsg
E230 is better if you have abit more cash,btohqsg
F10 should be compared to w212,btohqsg
if you are even richer can get E280,btohqsg
Yeah but Pre FL w212 does not come close to F10,btohqsg
if you want sporty there is alot of mods for the E55 which can be put on the E200,btohqsg
even the M5 V10 era also better,btohqsg
moral of the story  buy W211@deliciousweiming,btohqsg
for now  lets fix ur FD and enjoy it till the end of COE,btohqsg
if u say W140 S600 maybe haha,btohqsg
the car not even big enough,btohqsg
Pre FL E63 was 6.2L M156,btohqsg
FL E63 was 5.5L TT M157,btohqsg
Engine compartment no space for extra 4 cylinders,btohqsg
Ever thought of asking carwow to do a race with w211 and 212 e200 comparision,btohqsg
i can try that for you. W124  W210  W211 and W212,btohqsg
i will tell u with confidence W212 will win HAHA,btohqsg
Wanted compare the engine specs and the performance,btohqsg
yeah w212 really has a much better gearbox too and lighter,btohqsg
yeah W212 chassis is much much better,btohqsg
but i love the retro style of W211 and the quirks and features,btohqsg
interior in w211 is really good too for that era,btohqsg
swap out head unit and really is a bargain,btohqsg
Loved the one with the navi,btohqsg
haha yeah was better then idrive imo but since itâ€™s 2022  abit out of date,btohqsg
haha but wei ming  if u want a modern car  go for CN7,btohqsg
Probably can ask you for help on my car ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
haha why leh  what car do you drive?,btohqsg
this is true tank leh HAHA,btohqsg
