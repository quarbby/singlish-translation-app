So can this be resolved immediately after calling CS?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if can link CC to changi pay and use in China? Saw some dp about incuring cash advance fees  wondering if there are other dps on it. Thanks!,btohqsg
Nope tried for 8 days via CS. End up their higher management insists i go make a police report for suspected scam. With the police report then they unlock. Fk up.,btohqsg
What omg then I shouldnâ€™t have transferred my funds there too,btohqsg
Which means can only transfer out in smaller tranches?,btohqsg
I just put it there for daily interest and pay my bills on the final due date  which means now itâ€™s not doable anymore,btohqsg
Seems red flags are either large sum or multiple smaller sums in a short period of time,btohqsg
I just put in 100k few days back  gosh ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I was putting it for daily interest while my other accounts reset then when resetted move them back,btohqsg
Seems likes it affects most accounts even gxs right?,btohqsg
Which means if I want to transfer the 100k out now sure kena block?,btohqsg
Do it one shot if u have decided to siam them. Theirs is block after transfer. Lol,btohqsg
I did one 50k and four 10k. During the fourth transfer kena block,btohqsg
Ooo ok nice Iâ€™ll do 100k at my credit card due date cos I need pay it on due date on 13 march,btohqsg
Once unblocked i one shot transfer everything out,btohqsg
But itâ€™s a good place to put some funds for some interest,btohqsg
Yes. The daily interest is good. Mathematically it means compounded daily,btohqsg
Ya instead of paying the bills immediately I always pay on the due date itself so I have extra interests,btohqsg
Anyone in HR doing payroll?Is it really troublesome to help a staff change his salary crediting bank account from one to another with many steps to follow ?,btohqsg
Dangerous if u get blocked on the day u need to repay the card bill.,btohqsg
Hmm true but whenâ€™s the best time to transfer it out then ðŸ˜«,btohqsg
Hi all  just checking how long did you guys wait for the choco card?,btohqsg
I would rather play safe and pay bills at least 2 working days earlier. The 2 days interest not worth my blood pressure,btohqsg
if i spent and have transaction posted in Jan but have my refund credited in Feb  will the citi points be offset in Janâ€™s or Febâ€™s points? iâ€™d imagine itâ€™ll be offset against my spent in Feb since Janâ€™s already calculated but just wanted to be sure. thanks!,btohqsg
Hi I have the same question which I posted earlier but didn't manage to get a clear confirmation.Anyone knows if we will need to pay the Annual Management Fee of 0.03% on top of the expense ratio of 0.05%?,btohqsg
Only one 0.05% p.a. charged by Amundi (based on my limited info). POEMS do not charge anything else. You may check with POEMS what is the 0.03% p.a. about,btohqsg
Hi! My tax payment is currently on giro. Anyone know if I can change giro from bank acct to pay using the chocolate debit card monthly via giro?,btohqsg
Why donâ€™t u just manually monthly use chocolate to pay,btohqsg
just pay using chocolate card via AXS at least 1 week before giro,btohqsg
Just use the card and pay about 1 week before giro deduction date. How do you pay with a debit card via giro?,btohqsg
Oh right. So have to remove the current giro scheme and manually pay monthly?,btohqsg
Nono just pay. ur giro amount will adjust accordingly,btohqsg
No. Keep the GIRO arrangement  else they won't accept your payment.,btohqsg
So just keep the giro arrangement then every month pay the monthly amount using choc debit card before the giro deduction happens? There wouldnâ€™t be a second deduction from giro?,btohqsg
Yes  pay manually at least 1 week before giro deduction date.Say your income tax bill is 1.2k. You pay 1k with choco card. 200 will be deducted via giro,btohqsg
Is there a way to pay monthly? I thought axs need us to pay all in one shot?,btohqsg
set installment via giro then pay via AXS 1 week before monthly giro deduction,btohqsg
not true that AXS need to pay all in one shot,btohqsg
So eg for Mar & Apr I have outstanding $2k to pay. On IRAS website when I click pay  they tell me to pay the full $2k instead of the $1k amount which is currently deducted monthly. So am I allowed to just pay the $1k amount via axs?Cause I canâ€™t change the amount to pay on axs application,btohqsg
can put any amount between $5 and 9999.99 to pay on axs app ah,btohqsg
So donâ€™t pay via IRAS > AXS right? Just pay directly on AXS application?,btohqsg
Hi  can i check jf i link my UOB one credit card for the heymax 3mpd campaign  will i be entitled to the miles? Because this card is a cashback card,btohqsg
Hi can I check if anyone has successfully managed to request for a credit card late fee waiver from DBS?,btohqsg
I'm not in HR  but when I change bank I dun even need to tell my HR. So dunno how hard izzit for HR.I just need to change my NRIC Paynow to the new bank,btohqsg
Sure but hope it wonâ€™t get stuck  Iâ€™m paying direct from the credit card bank so itâ€™s immediate payment  just hope Mari wont block me from transferring my funds out tho,btohqsg
Depends. Some only accept direct bank accounts while some accept PayNow NRIC like yours.,btohqsg
Depends on company   some have payroll automated then just on your own update the system by certain date. Straight forward,btohqsg
Cos previously I asked my HR if I can change my salary crediting bank account bcos I sign up for the ocbc 360 ac. The stupid HR just simply Said cannot change just bcos I found a better interest bank AC. She said it's troublesome to keep helping staff change their bank AC.,btohqsg
It's part of their jd right? Why they refuse to do their job,btohqsg
Wah â€¦ payroll can automate one now.,btohqsg
