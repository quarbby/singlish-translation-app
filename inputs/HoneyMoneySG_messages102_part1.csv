Question: UOB stash account is 5% effective for the first 100k? If I have 2 stash accounts  will it be 5% on both the 100k?,btohqsg
Have you read thru UOB stash website first?,btohqsg
Looked through the rates table. But not sure if I have 2 stash accounts  will it be the same,btohqsg
3%  please check t&c for more details.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if dbs yuu card take mrt and bus does it consider as a spending in the mcc code?,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/COvLCoKj554?si=Ez78GBi8RxrZxq73Anyone using the UOB triple card strategy by Honey Money? Is it worth the hassle to switch from UOB One + Absolute Cashback?,btohqsg
it really depends on your spending habits  if you took UOB one and spends alot on those additional cashback merchants  i will stick to UOB one,btohqsg
Agree with wz. I use this uob strategy because I'm a miles chaser. These cards cover 90% of my spendings.,btohqsg
Agree. These cards seems like cover almost everything,btohqsg
Hi  are there any credit cards where you can get miles/cashback from paying insurance premiums? eg. citi premier miles,btohqsg
Search chat history ‚Äúinsurance miles‚Äù or ‚Äúinsurance cashback‚Äù,btohqsg
Not really related  but anyone facing issue on grab payment methods?,btohqsg
I don't see yuu actually have exclusion based on mcc... base spending is covering almost usual spending  the exclusions are fair usual stuff. Only those with partners gives the up to 18% cashback that have a yuu account to use with,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt mind can I ask if most credit card consider mrt and bus as a spending in their mcc?,btohqsg
1. Yuu dont use mcc codes. Base spend is 0.5%. Because its not a list of codes  the Exclusion u have to read t&c.2 I use it for bus and and mrt and I expecting that include as a spending under basic spend cashback.What I am sure if only those with yuu partners u get the up to 18% cash rebate,btohqsg
Hi experts  for next month uob one account of 150k  by when do u need to deposit the money to qualify for the 4%,btohqsg
Anyone using Zym Mobile experiencing network issues?,btohqsg
Only if u have entered the big saving promotion u have to put before 30 April if u joined this month. Else u are free to put in anytime the 4% is based on your monthly average saved  as long as u meet the spending and credit requiremenr,btohqsg
Base spend is 0.5 not 5,btohqsg
Hm  i didn‚Äôt really experience network issues eh. But probably mine not accurate cos im usually at places where the coverage is perfect.Where did u get bad network?,btohqsg
Using Zym Mobile  network is currently down...,btohqsg
isn't zym on singtel network? seems like singtel is getting outage based on downdetector,btohqsg
I m also having zym issue,btohqsg
I got full bar at a shopping mall... but no 4g/5g,btohqsg
Have not had a good experience with zym   tried it out because of the freebies but the network is just trash. Stick to circles/M1 üëç,btohqsg
I had no issues with Zym (Singtel) in Singapore but more relatably  zym partners are very good in Malaysia (Maxis) and Thailand (AIS),btohqsg
i'm on zym.. i had issue awhile  ago arounf 12-1220.. restarted my phone.. now ok,btohqsg
I restarted my phone  still having issues . First time for me though,btohqsg
"I searched for ""insurance cashback"" and went thru around 20 msg... Seems like the answer is maybank platinum visa?https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/170135",btohqsg
Tried contacting them in WA.... no reply.... damn sian... its so disruptive right now...,btohqsg
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. I just realised these cards are not eligible for bonus interest on UOB one account?,btohqsg
Only UOB lady card is eligible,btohqsg
maybank platinum visa yes.. but your insurance premiums only account for half of the required min. spend.e.g. if you're going for the $300 monthly spend tier  insurance premiums will only count for $150,btohqsg
Yeah but both GOMO and ZYM are on Singtel. And all 3 got different status,btohqsg
We don't know what happens on the backend  can only wait till issue is resolved now,btohqsg
I got zero connectivity in jewel... u got to be kidding me!!! Hahaha...,btohqsg
Its the opposite for me. When i was with Circles  i had 0 network at multiple locations that i go to on a regular basis. Switched to zym about a year ago and no issues so far,btohqsg
Cardup has listed which bank credit cards can earn miles from Cardup.Visit website for details.https://www.cardup.co/personal/rewards-calculator,btohqsg
Thanks  but I think this link is outdated.. UOB one card is excluded  Maybank visa platinum rewards up to 2k.. all these are not reflected in this site..,btohqsg
Why am I seeing recent duplicated settlements for tap&go from my travel in Europe which was alrdy previously deducted?,btohqsg
