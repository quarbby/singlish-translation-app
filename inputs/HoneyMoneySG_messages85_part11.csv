Anything contributed via RSTU will be reserved,btohqsg
Then I recall there's another video saying that you cannot shield ur SA fully due to lower limit of 40k.So does it mean the shielding can only be done above 40k/RSTU whichever is higher ?,btohqsg
How to set up for this?,btohqsg
UOB card annual fee waiveThey might deduct UNI$ for annual fee waiverWhat if they deducted can ask them credit back?Is this worth?Or just transfer all UNI$ to miles first before asking fee waiver ( afraid UOB decline if insufficient UNI$),btohqsg
set up a giro for your tax payments,btohqsg
Any good to open the hsbc account? Promo or anything?,btohqsg
maybe try googling rather than expect to be spoon fed everything,btohqsg
Just ask for waiver  they will return the UNI$.,btohqsg
Short answer  yes.The first 40k for SA can only be used for the formation of RA. This 40k will automatically include the reserved funds from RSTU.Any amounts that you RSTU above the 40k will also be reserved for the formation of RA.,btohqsg

Means there is nothing to worry about if RSTU below 40k as even with no RSTU  your 40k will always be reserved for RA,btohqsg

Hi  can I check if I use Spaylater on Shopee  will it still be eligible for 4mpd for cards like HSBC revolutions  Citi+ amaze  titanium OCBC?,btohqsg
Anyone try uob cash plus 3 month 0% promo?,btohqsg
Any catch? Seem like too good to be true,btohqsg
0% interest but there is a nominal admin fee paid upfront. So overall there is still some cost to borrow.Edit: I see there's a 0% p.a. for 3 months promotion with $0 fee  seems like it's only for new customers,btohqsg
Website show 0% EIR  suppose it won't give wrong info,btohqsg
Hi. It seems that all insurance renewal premiums can only be paid with mastercard? What I see good credit card for insurance payments are visa and amex cards  which can only be done for first or single premium.,btohqsg
You mean all AIA* insurance renewal premiums.You can use services like cardup  ipaymy with your visa card to pay and possibly get rewards. With a small fee of course.,btohqsg
Oh? AIA only? Damn. Hate this insurer,btohqsg
It varies from insurer to insurer.,btohqsg
For the travelone card  do I need to spend $500 or $1000 (as mentioned in the hsbc website) to get the miles when the annual fee is paid? Thanks,btohqsg
You get the miles when you pay the annual fee. Spending requirement is for the gifts,btohqsg
just afraid they just let me to cancel the cardif they really deduct my uni$ can ask them to credit back or?,btohqsg
Okay  spending amt will 500 or 1000?,btohqsg
If cancel  they are supposed to return the uni$ bc the yni$ deducted is for the year ahead,btohqsg
Maybe I'll give the customer support line a call tomorrow morning to ask about this  it does seem like a good deal even if it's only for 3 months 😁,btohqsg
Yeah  just nice for moomoo 5.8% 😂,btohqsg
Hi. Is there any cc for 1 shot big spend for buying of home stuff... to earn miles,btohqsg
Hi all  is there anyway info regarding the comparison between uob one account vs ocbc 360? Like which one is better. Tnx,btohqsg
Or this toohttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/164032But I'm waiting for the video on this one to come out first just to be sure 😊,btohqsg
Maybe you can watch this video by Chris and find out:https://youtu.be/M9S2D6xZxhE?si=bS_XOjT8pMtboEkG,btohqsg
Great. Tnx! If anyone also has personal experience with both accounts would be great to know more.,btohqsg
There might be slight changes in the accounts as the video is for the past year.,btohqsg
Is there anything specific you're asking about?,btohqsg
But this is very helpful anyway,btohqsg
They both seem attractive  but mostly interested to know about the effective interest rates   promos  app functionality etc… First will watch the video.,btohqsg
No changes since  just different promos available. If you want my short answer  UOB One has more pros than OCBC 360.,btohqsg
I made some calculations and seems ocbc gives more interest… not sure tho,btohqsg
They have a tool on their website to calculate the rate,btohqsg
Depends on what u have in hand to get interest  for ocbcUOB has more str8 forward requirements (basically just 2),btohqsg
