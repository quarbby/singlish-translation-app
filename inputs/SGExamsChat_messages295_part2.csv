growing german pop.   space was needed  resources were also needed for autarky,btohqsg
policy of app. was the main reason for ww2,btohqsg
but a lot of countries dw to disarm so got conflict,btohqsg
economies weakened  so br reduced government spending,btohqsg
so br gahmen stopped spending on military as well,btohqsg
ye I think we r slowly transitioning to that topic,btohqsg
so appeasing hitler will give them time to properly rearm,btohqsg

someone give crash course on failure of lon pls,btohqsg
LON failed bc of membership issues,btohqsg
the organisation of roles were bad,btohqsg
USA wasnâ€™t even in there bc of isolationism,btohqsg
even though they were the richest country at that time,btohqsg
and was stable enough to make decisions for global affairs,btohqsg
oh so without the richest and most powerful country at that time the league was ineffective and couldnt persuade the member countries to do whatever they wanted them to?,btohqsg
yet still america didnâ€™t join bc they werenâ€™t keen on any sort of conflict,btohqsg
so i can use that to explain failure?,btohqsg
but again u bear un mind thereâ€™s another factor which was the failure of controlling bigger nations,btohqsg
like they wonâ€™t resort 2 use armed forces 2 solve conflicts like that,btohqsg
bc germany was determined to rearm,btohqsg
i can list down the failure in the abyssinian crisis too right,btohqsg
and when the abyssinia king asked for help,btohqsg
they only imposed limited econ sanctions,btohqsg
cos they were frens w italy,btohqsg
britain and france gave it away to italy as a peace offerinh,btohqsg
but italy wanted the whole of Abyssinia,btohqsg

when ppl found out there had been a secret deal,btohqsg
and thus looked upon as a failure,btohqsg
