Problem is  at the time…only my bro and I in the house  my parents flew outside of eh,btohqsg

You can’t decide between spf or army right  go army become mp lorh,btohqsg
Nevr seen internship pay 3 to 4k one,btohqsg
This was part of the criteria,btohqsg
that’s my stipend after passing qualification,btohqsg
Part time job 4K a month,btohqsg
Either the boss don’t know how to correctly pay people cause it’s a startup,btohqsg
Btw is the “k2” in your bio referencing a mountain ? Idk much Chinese,btohqsg
"especially those ""above 16  part time students""",btohqsg
You have to do in the office,btohqsg
Yea I’m seeing 20/hr on these,btohqsg
I have a friend that used to help with setting up of exam venues,btohqsg
As part of a moving company…he was tasked to setup tables and chairs for ite east,btohqsg
He said  sometimes got 3hr break,btohqsg
Start at 8 end at 4 but most of the time got at least a 2hr break in between  moving tables and chairs at a exam venue,btohqsg
Yup  sometimes they end at 3,btohqsg
Yea  transportation is free as well,btohqsg
The company truck will bring him back to his nearest mrt station,btohqsg
…bruh hong Kan lah the uncles,btohqsg
My job also…the SingPost truck drivers  all the wack as uncles,btohqsg
I see them enter the compound like their grandfather road,btohqsg
Speeding  cutting people off  jam breaking…driving over curb  scraping against gate…,btohqsg
It’s like a very direct reputation hit   unlike movers…they always shift ppl at diff parts of sg,btohqsg
I also see a lot of shit working at SingPost,btohqsg
Now I know why packages sometimes come crushed  even broken,btohqsg
The ppl all wayang one  I’ve seen packages get dragged by the trucks,btohqsg
Then I see with my very own eyes  the driver get out pick up the driven over package…open the rear of the truck and just toss it back in there,btohqsg
At least you got this kind o go briefing,btohqsg
I work for nearly 3 months  everybody looks like a supervisor…idk who tf is my actual supervisor,btohqsg
When we end shift  the supervisor is not even present,btohqsg
Honestly cause pat time  I would do the same shit,btohqsg
Cause part time  cannot later Kenna blacklisted,btohqsg
My supervisor at SingPost told me  if I get blacklisted at my job…it means I will never be able to apply for a job at a SingPost establishment again,btohqsg
The problem with this is  a sizeable amount of high earning warehouse jobs are under the jurisdiction of SingPost,btohqsg
Even not high earning  a good portion is operated or jointly ventured by SingPost,btohqsg
I’ve seen with my own eyes ppl in my shift kenna thst treatment,btohqsg
I see them kneeling and begging to a supervisor (not mine),btohqsg
But they always got a lot of loopholes one,btohqsg
I doubt she will be this lucky a 2nd time,btohqsg
I feel like I’m her profession  it’s a issue of manpower,btohqsg
Damn that sounds so entitled??also yes whatever weed that is sounds like the good shit,btohqsg

i will alr grad with a BSc by the time i ORD,btohqsg
i most likely working as a teacher at my sec school for awhile first for good old time sake then do online courses at the same time ah (even in my unit before ord),btohqsg
when you feel like sneezing or coughing...can quickly use it to cover,btohqsg
in some environment..you know you are bound to sneeze/cough  that is when you have a mask instinctively to cover your nose or mouth,btohqsg
2 guys scrolling down naked I think,btohqsg
They say we can use our psea for uni/ buy laptop,btohqsg
Plus what are the expenses for uni,btohqsg
I dont want to burden my parents,btohqsg
Ur comment on ntu mkt place,btohqsg
Its not as ex as I thought,btohqsg
I thought it would be like 30 or smth,btohqsg
or can like most people  just apply for tuition fee loan,btohqsg
and moe study loan if you meet the criteria,btohqsg
How long are the school holidays ah,btohqsg
bruh I save so little in ns,btohqsg
I buy laptop and accessories clothes is alr just nice,btohqsg
plus part time work can get 8k and then 5k cos nsfs can get 3k from skillsfuture  1k ord credit 1k psea account,btohqsg
Oh wow  I thought people don't do that in this group.,btohqsg
Just “gave” my laptop to my younger bro to play with his friends…I’m such a good brother,btohqsg
Yeah  I remember this group being delightful,btohqsg
Some troller came in then try stir shit la,btohqsg
Some kid in a nsfw pfp came in as well,btohqsg
I got a feeling that is over estimation,btohqsg
Maybe if all the stars align 3k possible,btohqsg
Whoa  a lot sure has changed,btohqsg
But frs i love this yr qn sia,btohqsg
Ehh bro How long is a internship,btohqsg
Is not abt how many u need,btohqsg

I j think its good practice for me,btohqsg
Im tilted coz i lost my case comp,btohqsg
And im thinking of how to improve,btohqsg
gg to be 10 now wow,btohqsg

Can't wait to be done with SAF after MR when I'm 30,btohqsg
Eh  you would end by 30 meh?,btohqsg
like you need to do reservist a certain number of times after ord,btohqsg
I realised that Private First Class exists,btohqsg
be in a unit that has no use for reservist,btohqsg
Not really anymore  the dumb wrong move is really your fault by now,btohqsg
lol you’ve told this story before,btohqsg
but it’s so stupid idm hearing again,btohqsg
i just wanna say that bedok went from “how can i down pes on purpose” to sorta not minding and maybe try for command sch then now ooc,btohqsg
On a more serious note  if I want to get mental health help  what do I say to the MO?,btohqsg
Cause I went to Polyclinic and Polyclinic told me to refer to MO,btohqsg
really depends on the MO tho like,btohqsg
I don't mind  I just want to get better mentally,btohqsg
Not here to Chao keng or ooc,btohqsg
ya some MOs really trivialise mental health,btohqsg
later they start saying weird stuff,btohqsg
i mean they just aren’t equipped to handle mental health situations,btohqsg
Cause regulars can easily just cross over  lol,btohqsg
imo it comes down to how they see mental health as a person and not as an MO lol,btohqsg
if u seek mental health help form the mo what if they say until u downpes,btohqsg
So I just tell my superiors during FP that I want to RS to visit MO for Mental Health Support?,btohqsg
i’ve never RSIed before i think,btohqsg
^I'm actually going to do it this Monday so that's how it goes  yeah?,btohqsg
it’s always get sent to MO,btohqsg
the one time i rsi for real cos legit not feeling well  i ended up getting sent to hospital cos my toe was fractured without me realising,btohqsg
like i hurt it and i thought just bruise la that’s why limp for a while,btohqsg
then MO saw me limping ask me take off my boots,btohqsg
i didn’t notice cos i wore my socks in the morning in the dark LOL,btohqsg
got my friend a free day off cos he accompany me go hospital,btohqsg
ur friend will be indebted to u,btohqsg
lol i think i got sent to ng teng fong,btohqsg
you just can’t use your own time as a metric,btohqsg
if you’re raised in a different kind of society then ofc it gets harder to deal with things that to us would be acceptable cos back then it was ok,btohqsg
everyone gonna say “my time we had it harder”,btohqsg
like im gonna tell my kids “back in my days i had to study 3h2 1h1”,btohqsg
“back in my day it was 90rp not 70rp”,btohqsg
simply put  values and what is deemed appropriate rapidly evolves,btohqsg
my uncle literally earlier tonight was telling me how he was smacked in the face with the belt buckle lol,btohqsg
back in my day psle reported lowest score each year,btohqsg
in your case i think you expected it to be so so bad that reality just wasn’t as bad,btohqsg
tbf this isn’t about being a genius,btohqsg
it’s just exploring more when they were younger,btohqsg
it’s a lot easier now too cos social media advertises a ton of these events,btohqsg
“back in my day” it was a lot harder to find,btohqsg
i mean yea that one genius but you can get quite a good portfolio by just exploring,btohqsg
like my mentee now j1 and she’s finding her own stuff to join,btohqsg
rn got some sutd hackathon she just join for experience,btohqsg
like i’m sure when i was in jc those opportunities existed,btohqsg
it was just harder to find,btohqsg
im not a genius and i just attend hackathon for the experience,btohqsg
perks of being in h2 computing ✌️🏼,btohqsg
all i can do is code,btohqsg
it just happens to be my forte,btohqsg
but yea like a lot of these events the minimum is being in jc/poly to register,btohqsg
i cant write a single report for shiz,btohqsg
that's for hackathons la but for others,btohqsg
still can find just must know how,btohqsg
like rn there's the worldwide AI hackathon going on,btohqsg
literally anyone can register and it's online,btohqsg
yup finna SS Ryan’s pfp rn,btohqsg
anyone here got do statistical analysis before ? especially on Likert data,btohqsg

you are reminded of it everytime in the army song,btohqsg
legit went from shit talking about a level to ns,btohqsg
this time i try another sub combi ah,btohqsg

After covid all tone down rdy i heard,btohqsg

I’m in my the weekend era,btohqsg
I'm waiting for Warzone mobile to come out since I heard Activision is replacing mobile with Warzone Mobile,btohqsg
Activision be trying to streamline everything,btohqsg
Not like I will make it to Uni,btohqsg
Jc is one final exam right,btohqsg
that’s if you aim super high la,btohqsg
the way to study and do well in uni doesn’t always translate from jc,btohqsg
like just looking at how you revise a subject for example,btohqsg
uni forces you to be more independent in your learning and some people aren’t prepared for that,btohqsg
if you’re too reliant on the prof materials you’re gonna have trouble,btohqsg
yea idk depends how bad the bad sem is too la,btohqsg
my bad sem was 3.9 but ik to a lot of people that’s good,btohqsg
i nvr had to buy any textbook,btohqsg
feel like that’s more common overseas,btohqsg
also ntu library has most textbooks we need in their database,btohqsg
if it’s not the prof generally avoided it,btohqsg
my prof specifically chose a textbook that was good but also on arxiv,btohqsg
in poly i brought a textbook for $50 bucks,btohqsg
End up lecturer didnt even use it to teach,btohqsg
Best part its only for 1 sem,btohqsg
Same thing happened in my secondary school  except it was 4 textbooks at $200+,btohqsg
the only textbooks i own now are ones i bought myself and actually use,btohqsg
Ya to me it's good lul,btohqsg
my bad sems were those with language modules,btohqsg
but I forgot my worst sem already,btohqsg
To be honest I read something about mental illnesses and Uni/Masters and PhD programs in a study once  I think the best thing you can do for yourself at uni is to make sure you have a good social circle.,btohqsg
Even if you’re not the smartest a good group can keep you going to completion,btohqsg
Plus the fact that there are other humans around you makes you just a bit more accountable to them for your own well-being  it can be very tough in many courses,btohqsg
this is kinda funny timing since i’m giving a presentation soon on mental health in academia for one of my PhD seminar courses,btohqsg
tbh its more of it being my first sem so i hadn’t fully adapted i feel,btohqsg
but yes i agree. a good circle of friends keeps me going even though i’m stressed out of my mind all the time nowadays,btohqsg
I went through quite the metamorphosis  mentally and physically speaking during university and not for the better lol.Nowadays I’m a lot more open minded and able to control my emotions better  which some people seem to think makes me more professional.Guess it’s not all bad  but damn university really does accelerate your brain development after 2 years of regression while wearing the helmet.,btohqsg
You know the thing they say about soldiers who have seen combat right? They’re never the same again  wow I feel in some ways the stress level and what happened are comparable to that lol.,btohqsg
uni changed me a lot for the better and got me to where i am now  although i can feel myself regressing mental health wise slowly ever since i started the PhD,btohqsg
like i’ve truthfully nvr been very stressed during undergrad,btohqsg
and it felt laughable compared to how i’m feeling now,btohqsg
I think for you perhaps you’re very academically inclined and you’ve only just met the frontier of how far you can push yourself,btohqsg
But for me my academic performance was fueled by tuition,btohqsg
Once that was gone it’s like withdrawal symptoms,btohqsg
idk about academically inclined because i kinda lucked my way into uni,btohqsg
i told this to the chat before but i really didn’t study for A levels or do anything for it outside of PW,btohqsg
it was only in uni that i found my groove sorta,btohqsg
so i nvr really had anything to get withdrawal symptoms for,btohqsg
Well I think the admittance to university is a fairly high bar in the first place so you don’t feel academically strong but innately  if we objectively chart your performance relative to the population  you are (or were).,btohqsg
was never academically inclined  no tuition helped me to ace cuz i just had no passion hahaha its only now that im in CS in uni that im doing alot better,btohqsg
Whereas for me  my university degree is attributable to tuition quite clearly lol,btohqsg
perhaps that’s a way to look at it,btohqsg
Would not be a degreeholder if tuition didn’t drag me across the minimal grade line to qualify,btohqsg
then theres me who went into a uni simply bc my sch allowed me to mix my o levels,btohqsg
i guess some people just adapt to or even prefer to the uni system better esp when you’re honed into your course,btohqsg
Guys this is a yearly intake for poly students,btohqsg
Hey everyone has to take some road to their future  so just make the best of it,btohqsg
This is the yearly intake for JC students,btohqsg
for me by the time i got to JC i was just spent and didn’t care about A levels,btohqsg
so i just followed through the motion,btohqsg
i mean im not complaining with my results hahaha,btohqsg
This is the amount of o levels candidates a year,btohqsg
lol i didn’t even have a bad reaction when seeing my results,btohqsg
n then theres me who couldnt process bc of specific reasons,btohqsg
there are ways to enter poly outside of O levels,btohqsg
look at the amt of fails,btohqsg
doing the maths  its over 10 000 students from other streams,btohqsg
considering that like schs like ri and hwach each have around 1000+ students per cohort,btohqsg
i still dont understand why ppl rather poly than jc tho,btohqsg
to the point where they’re so disgusted by jc,btohqsg
there’s good and bad reasons to want poly,btohqsg
like wldnt u be kinda proud u got in to a jc,btohqsg
i find the tiktok for u,btohqsg
idk...its the governmnet way of counting females,btohqsg
You get a 1 year discount if you are intending to go to Uni and then work is a big one,btohqsg
but then proceeds to shit on yi ori,btohqsg
Are all of those for Singaporean only cohort or Sg/PR and not counting non sg in attendance?,btohqsg
its like when u alr go in with such a negstive mindset u end up seeing everything like shit,btohqsg
if yall dont study then gg lor,btohqsg
i feel like its true but at the same time,btohqsg
like after experiencing a lvls myself,btohqsg
for people like me who rly struggled with econs  finding out that the higher band teachers made more sense that my band teachers was abit sad,btohqsg
as scary as ppl make it sound like,btohqsg
i mean i do get the banding system,btohqsg
thats reality lo its always like that man 💀💀,btohqsg
19 000 enrolled for engineering science,btohqsg
dk whatever the system is anymore its so confusing,btohqsg
but i do feel that theres pros and cons ? for whichever we want to go to,btohqsg
wld u rather be the stupid one put into a class with clever ppl,btohqsg
like its damn hard to catch up man,btohqsg
i felt like shit trying to catch up with students who were literally taking h3 econs,btohqsg
i mean i went into jc just to find out i was doing badly in everything but computing so now im acing in a CS degree,btohqsg
then they there talk chicken while i speak dog,btohqsg
eat banana  fling poo  bang wife  life good.,btohqsg
It good for someone like me,btohqsg
but others who do feel that once youre in JC you have to do the best  then its def stressful la,btohqsg
wldnt u say that that wld be the same for anything else,btohqsg
im glad my fam was respectful for how my results turned out and allowed me to go into priv u instead of trying to retake when i knew what i wanted to do,btohqsg
like theres always competition to be the best even in pri sch,btohqsg
ironically i’d consider that i was most stressed in pri sch than in mi,btohqsg
prob the least stressed i ever felt in mi actually,btohqsg
trust me bruv literally 5 years down the road no one give a shit about what uni you pop out from,btohqsg
no one ask for what uni and stuff,btohqsg
in pri sch i was fighting for my life trying to top classes and shit,btohqsg
they legit only ask about work experience,btohqsg
and thats highkey where the stress comes about,btohqsg
why go social science/law dip when u can do degree,btohqsg
i mean everything is to each their own,btohqsg
like taking a law dip dont rlly make sense right,btohqsg
not like u can go for bar with a dip,btohqsg
some people aren’t mature about it but you can’t compare your own experiences with others,btohqsg
cnfm the big number is cuz of the whole chs system,btohqsg
so idk why life is a thing ah,btohqsg
but i somehow am still a human,btohqsg
guess ppl dont like poking mouths,btohqsg
Does this show a improving economy?,btohqsg
THE DIFF BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE FOR SCIENCE 💀💀,btohqsg
forgive me but idk what’s the point you’re trying to make,btohqsg
Do u think the Eco is improving?,btohqsg
Why would there be a correlation between our economic performance and expenditure per capita for student sorry?,btohqsg
Exactly. I heard abt looming bank collapses,btohqsg
There ‘s more. U.S has one of the worst track records on loans & interest rates. Bound to have more,btohqsg
the law here qualify for paralegal iirc,btohqsg
idk...my thinking is like more money spent on edcuation means we got more money in general? because as far as i can tell  there has not been some significant change in terms of how we spread out funds for education,btohqsg
Look at the intake and the graduates,btohqsg
I mean if you wanted to know how the economy was doing don’t need infer from education spending lol,btohqsg
dw  i know there are better ways,btohqsg
Like trying to measure distance with bananas  can be done but why go such a roundabout way to do it and infer,btohqsg
measure the entire circumference of the world by foot,btohqsg
so someone technically walked around the earth,btohqsg
logan sergeant demanding his engineers to speak in american and dtop using km/h,btohqsg
his name at the start of the song,btohqsg
No bro. That one is Luis Fonsi,btohqsg
Every context switching so fast idk what the topic is  just general chat I suppose?,btohqsg
what.. shouldn’t it be the other way right,btohqsg
wld yall want tuition from the bottom tier ite-jc kid,btohqsg
Why is intake and enrollment diff,btohqsg
yes i see smtg that is not of my concern  literally my life ✨,btohqsg
Intake is the current year  enrollment is all who are currently studying.,btohqsg
Join SQ nxt time. Easier to find those,btohqsg
LOL nvm I go work flight attendant then find daddies in first class,btohqsg
I haven’t been here in so long,btohqsg

It says successful though? So just do your best. I know some people who took a longer path to a better future,btohqsg
I DUNNNO WAT TO DO WITHOUT,btohqsg
I tot sch start alr or is that for Nitec,btohqsg
Best thing you’ll learn in life is you can’t change the past  and only what you do now will change your future.,btohqsg
Accept it and be humbled  then do your best to grow,btohqsg
I feel like i fucked up,btohqsg
