oh ya  jz saying rite  some exams have a validity period,btohqsg
ok cos im graduating in 2024,btohqsg
uhh  if im not wrong  sat is valid for 5yrs? okay  shd be quite safe then,btohqsg
but if you got NS and other things then its dif,btohqsg
australia has its own admission test also  my sis is in there now  not too sure abt UK though,btohqsg
damn it man the j2 life,btohqsg
legit social life here is the worst,btohqsg
i can relate thats why i got out HAHAHA,btohqsg
Why is social life in aus bad?,btohqsg
Hii sorry for the promotion here !! I'm a student looking for a hitch ride daily from my house ( near stadium )to a school in tanah merah,btohqsg
Pls pm if you can help thanks !!,btohqsg
Hello guys  Im looking for some people to do some user testing for a UI prototype.Just need to go through the prototype and answer a few questions. If interested DM me pls!,btohqsg
So go JC does not mean auto land in NUS/NTU?,btohqsg
If A Level get DDD/D means game over?,btohqsg
the game is over if u give up,btohqsg
not game over - means you have to find another way around,btohqsg
you cannot proceed ahead with your a level grades,btohqsg
but if ppl go jc just cuz they think it can get them into uni when they not suited to it,btohqsg
It means most of the courses in the autonomous uni are out of reach. Then you will need to consider private uni in which mostly depends on $$,btohqsg
If go Poly need GPA 4.0?,btohqsg
depends on course  i.e. nus cs usually >3.8,btohqsg
I think this applies for med and rep,btohqsg
the others can be a bit lower,btohqsg
n small intake courses like dent and dsai?,btohqsg
but it is easier to get into uni via JC,btohqsg
rather than a whole bunch of modules (that usually consist of group projects),btohqsg
Wow then need think go JC vs Poly,btohqsg
But if jc go uni is definitely wasy easier,btohqsg
Plus your route after grad from uni is faster,btohqsg
i mean all i know is if u go jc just be someone who isnt in need to know exactly why things work when its not tested  cuz i did pretty badly for my jc time then i went SIM but now im doing pretty good,btohqsg
I always support JC route especially for guys  due to NS.Put it this way  for related engineering courses  poly student get to skip 1 year because 1st year NUS modules are approximately similar to poly 3rd year I guess.But there's 2 years break. Rigour is lost. Jump straight into 2nd year uni not that good an idea.,btohqsg
poly students also don't get easier courses to help with GPA if they jump straight. Or if they also start from scratch  then they lose one year of time.,btohqsg
however if you are not disciplined enough to work hard and not give up  don't go Jc also. JC requires tremendous discipline to do well. That means sacrificing all your games and to some extent  sleep.,btohqsg
Yeahhh i agree if i were in poly i would have 0 chance of going to local U as i dont think i can do projects :( on the other hand im doing rather well in jc :),btohqsg
Not really for certain combis (our u have innate talent) even minimal effort is possible for one to thrive,btohqsg
sad to say  the vast majority do not have the talent. So I cannot give advice based on the talented few.,btohqsg
For those who do well  there's a lot of hard work  sweat and tears behind the success stories,btohqsg
I see a lot of ppl can slack in jc and then cram before a's,btohqsg
In that regard poly is more difficult,btohqsg
The way I see it poly is if you ready to grind for 2.5 yesrs,btohqsg
depends on what level of game u want to play in,btohqsg
Jc if u good at exam and ready to megagrind for a half,btohqsg
some high scorers do that also,btohqsg
I'm the type that hit 90 and above for 3 of the A level subjects,btohqsg
but I was not ready to work hard on the 4th one until 3 months before As,btohqsg
wadio i was a 70 person,btohqsg
let's just say for maths  70% was my lowest actual score and my teacher was actually worried for me when I dropped that low for one of the exams,btohqsg
Ye I think thats the difference,btohqsg
Not possible for poly cuz of the gpa system,btohqsg
not impossiblepoly is pretty similar to uni in that area,btohqsg
