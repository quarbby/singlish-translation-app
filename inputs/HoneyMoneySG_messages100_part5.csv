anyone knows if it's possible to call in to get a fee waiver for late charge / finance charges from hsbc if i missed a credit card payment by 1 day?,btohqsg
Usually first time most banks quite ok. Subsequently they may reject.,btohqsg

Can preconvert to myr to deduct from myr wallet when use for top up,btohqsg
But the gist is more then that haha  hopefully those who are sharp enough to catch it,btohqsg
Just to mention Maybank family and friends gives 8% cash rebate for ringgit spend. Cap $312.50 spending.,btohqsg
I mean for places that dont take card lah. I use maybank fnf for place that does and tng for those that dont. Dont tell me u can use card at kopitiam and some cafe dont take card,btohqsg
The acceptance of tng is almost 90 percent while card is maybe half half for big malaysia city. So dont compare card usage to tng ok,btohqsg

May I ask if I can use this dbs yuu card to pay other credit cards please. Whether this will be able to count as the 800 minimum spend thanks,btohqsg
If it count everyone will just do bill payment to double dip liao,btohqsg
Actually you will lose a bit coz I think max HSBC transfer limit is 250k? So u have to break the 360k into 2 days of transferring out. And it has to be routed to an another bank first before going back into the rotating HSBC account  so u r limited by that bank‚Äôs max transfer limit too.,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt really lose that much if the routing bank is scb esaver which has been paying 3.5-3.8% pa recently.,btohqsg
Hi all  if i didnt rem wrongly  I read that ocbc 360 bonus int credited on the 7th day of each month? Am I right pls? As just checked account and didn't see the int credited yet.,btohqsg
Tks trazora. Then shld be today üòä,btohqsg

Hi  Query on SCB smart credit card.6% cashback i think is not calculated correctlyEg. I using it for transport and on average i get 1point for every dollar as per statement  So eg if i spend 100sgd on transport which will be equivalent to 100points and while i go on scb360 reward resumption page it shows 3200points is equal to sgd10.So maths is not working out what scb is claiming. ( if i spend 100 on transport i should get 6dollar back equivalent point which should be 3200/10 √ó6 = 1920).Pls correct if i am missing something,btohqsg
Your bonus rewards point will come in the following statement cycle,btohqsg
Well I thinking the rotating bank other then hsbc can transfer in and out within the same day doesn't affect isn't. But yes within transfer limit and lots of banks can do 200k.,btohqsg
it is about 3 days max delay in normal weekdaysit is about 6 days max delay even if kenna weekends$360k x 6 days x 1.15% = $88 difference.ALSO  what are you trying to fight this $360k with? Other comparables only have max $150k holding now.,btohqsg
Anyone know of any signup bonus for Citi rewards card for existing Citi cc clients?,btohqsg
Using March/April as example  if $360k28th March = $160k from HSBC to SCB29th March = $200k from HSBC to SCB1st April = $200k from SCB to HSBC2nd April = $160k from SCB to HSBC,btohqsg
Hi all... I have problem with Amaze.I used it to for deposit/holding when staying in a Hotel in Thailand. This is quite normal when checking in hotel.It been 2 weeks since I returned and the payment has not been reversed. I checked with the hotel and they say  they have reverse the charge.anyone encounter this problem? how do u go about to resolve it?,btohqsg
yes amaze is known to have problems with Hotels and Car Rental charge and hold transactions.The money is likely stuck at Amaze now and they MIGHT contact you soon to ask you to switch to Wallet for them to credit your wallet.You can live chat with Amaze to be clear.,btohqsg
Oic. Tks hannah. No wonder not in.,btohqsg
Hi mt  just a qn! if I only can apply lady‚Äôs card instead of solitaire  that will be max 1k/month.Trade off for $10 001 wouldn‚Äôt be worth even if I max spend 1k/month on travel  right?,btohqsg
Using 1 mile = 1.5 cents:Interest loss assuming 4% p.a. savings account elsewhere (adjust yourself if yours is lower) = $10001 x 0.04 / 12 = $33.342 Miles Gain for $1000 = 1000 x 2 x 0.015 = $30Not worth. Only works for Solitaire with $2k cap  and assuming you come very close to maxing the cap each month.,btohqsg
What sort of transactions count as eligible transactions?,btohqsg
Did you bothered to read the whitlisted mccs. It was quite clear and comprehensive,btohqsg
Good morning all  for the HSBC EGA April EGA Bonus Interest Promotion  should I transfer in the funds ASAP once I got confirmation that I‚Äôm eligible? Any delay will mean lesser interest right?Also  if I don‚Äôt submit funds this month but only in May  does that mean the bonus interest will start in May? Or the higher rate for the first month will auto start in April. Thanks!,btohqsg

I don't have any UOB saving acct now and plan to open UOB lady saving acct. Anything to pay attention to? Like UOB one etc,btohqsg
Any reason for choosing lady over uob one?,btohqsg
yeah... think UOB One is better,btohqsg
My salary is w ocbc. More of laziness that I haven't opened UOB one.,btohqsg
i will suggest UOB One ....,btohqsg
i think you can just do the transfer to UOB yourself as salary payment  if you are lazy to get HR to change,btohqsg
Also for UOB One  the interest rate may not be the highest but it is easy to fulfill the 2 requirement. Especially where there is no increment of MAB requirement.,btohqsg
would you open UOB lady savings account (because of UOB lady card) if you already have UOB one?,btohqsg
Does the uob preferred platinum also give 4mpd for online travel related purchases?,btohqsg
Nope. Unless you use mobile contactless then got the bonus,btohqsg
Which online travel website or agency?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I have read up some previous discussions of this chat by very helpful members  regarding the hsbc 4.6% using 2 humans. MInd if I clarify how it works? (i have read the hsbc's official tnc but dont really understand)So every month we just swap the balances from A to B  and ensure for that month  5 fund transfers to and fro another bank is made  and that would make the ADB balance in the acct B earn 4.6%? Then first day of next month  do a B to A and 5 transfers using bank A?,btohqsg
Would anyone know which credit cards can stillBe used for hospital bills?,btohqsg
