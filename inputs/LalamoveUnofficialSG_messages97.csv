For drivers point of viewIts just a normal job,btohqsg
That’s what I saw too. Cos collection is from hotels etc and from their own team folks,btohqsg

With peak surcharges usually can see 14+ for short distance  now 10-11+  but still got ppl take,btohqsg
Not for me  really not worth the effort.,btohqsg

Llm got notification on thursday say $3 peak surchrge,btohqsg
Can van account take car and motor orders too?,btohqsg
If u can see the job means u can take if u want,btohqsg
I doubt so  I used back previous version also no more. Evening now got this so called high demand surcharges  I guess they are trying to get more ppl take up evening jobs  so removing the peak surcharges to put the money there.,btohqsg

Dear all  Kindly advise working with Lalamove what is their average rate and daily average order you can get?,btohqsg
hi  i am a new driver. am i allowed to stack two order at one time?,btohqsg
ya but make sure can meet timings if you stack  also try not to stack oddle orders cause sometimes they shadowban,btohqsg
how about two order within the same timing?,btohqsg
If u can. Just do it. But once u miss the timing. Ready to receive jot form to explain n oddle will ban for 1 to 2 days,btohqsg
Can stack if u r able to meet the timings of the orders picked up and drop off. But then its a big gamble as u know there might be delays then u really will be in deep waters,btohqsg
Kena 2 times in a row double order,btohqsg
Can. But u shld try out the restos n routes first to familiarise. Know the parking etc  how much time u need to get to resto from where u park  whether the restos r early or on time or late for pickup. U have a 10min buffer for advanced jobs pickup,btohqsg
Plan properly  also factor in time for traffic delays,btohqsg
All require u to have personal experience then u will know how go gauge,btohqsg
guy.. can help.. if i cashout before midnight today.. when they will bank in into my bank acct?,btohqsg

Btw llm dont have insurance just a heads up for riders. If anything broken or damage they will deduct from yr wallet,btohqsg
more like live since last week. now then tell us,btohqsg
Trial and error mah.. if vendor can afford that dynamic pricing means they continue.. which for me is good rather than +$3 only,btohqsg
The thing is not all jobs have  previous +3 surcharge was for all bike jobs,btohqsg
Yup i see that too.. sometimes pick up now dont have.. let just see how this dynamic pricing will last.. is either they lack of client or lack of rider/driver thats why this dynamic pricing kicks in,btohqsg
I rather have the normal peak surcharge  then have +$,btohqsg
This high demand surcharge is commission deductible,btohqsg
Depend on the area u are in.,btohqsg
Agreed. Now no more already. That fella mentions the new surcharge will replace the peak +3. Sigh,btohqsg
I dint see this 😂 peak n dynamic all gone 😂,btohqsg
All I see is ljf on sat sun then I offline llbird 😂😂😂,btohqsg

Dont understand why LLM accept all these stupid changes in oddle order.,btohqsg
Instead of improving... we go backwards,btohqsg
I think the Oddle orders have some issue. just scrolled thru some of them,btohqsg
Lao Bejing -> Lao BeiSun with Moon -> Sun wit,btohqsg
They dun want driver to choose,btohqsg

Ljf where got mood to take 😂,btohqsg
Tampin Shopping mall so crowded. Want parking still must go b3. Covid is gone . Life as normal. Haven't seen this crowd since pre covid,btohqsg
That why we need to be very careful now,btohqsg
Expected to spend more time waiting and travelling when doing order.,btohqsg
CTE exit to orchard also jam,btohqsg
Wah no order ah now… sian… just want to start doing,btohqsg
Tampines always crowded LOL. Whether covid or not,btohqsg

Abit too much ask motorbike deliver 7kg Whole Durians..,btohqsg
7kg durian.. Max 4 med size durian,btohqsg
bike limit is 8kg  40x25x25cm. 7kg is under weight but maybe oversize.,btohqsg
Ya right! Either you get Covid-19 or GTFO you scammer!,btohqsg
Ya i m concerned abt the size.. Quite uncomfortable for the biker too right & risky if dont secure properly.. I was just thinking if requestor trying to pull a fast one n hoping to get car driver instead. I was 1km away but didnt want to take cos dont want to condone such ppl. So sad that ppl actually want to exploit under rainy weather conditions... Hope whoever took the job completed it safely.,btohqsg
Do u all have the high demand surcharge now?,btohqsg
Seems like user can have the option to have high demand surcharge or not,btohqsg
I saw 1 order with high demand surcharge then user cancel and rebook with no high demand surcharge,btohqsg
Demand supply one of the factors  so as more riders login the surcharge drops.,btohqsg
Yesterday raining evening also no high demand,btohqsg
Go mall carpark also heavy traffic,btohqsg
Anyway with Omicron  v soon will be back to 2 dine-in,btohqsg
So guys juz hang in there  take a short break,btohqsg
With 5 unrelated dine-in  it will spread like fug again,btohqsg
Whoever taking this order good luck. Address is tajong pager not star vista. And the pickup phone number is wrong too,btohqsg
Now no jobs  alot of pple just swipe nvr see,btohqsg
Today got $10 tips from customer 💪,btohqsg

Hi I am using Lalamove for the 1st time. Please advise on the walker. Really need some advice. 😒,btohqsg
Massive jam towards PIE-TUAS direction from kallang exit to Adam Road exit,btohqsg
Ytd I kanna. Call cust to cancel.. but not English educated. So I blast cs,btohqsg
Customer ask me swipe complete then top up money for me to go there,btohqsg
How come so little orders today?,btohqsg
Think because all went out by themselves... everywhere crowded.. road also crowded,btohqsg
So far the orders with the surcharge worth it?,btohqsg
This place damn suay laa.. the traffic light often times confuses drivers/riders..,btohqsg
it's a car order  minimum should be $12.,btohqsg
So many time I reach there then they cancel.. appeal submit but no reply from lala til now,btohqsg
the agents are juggling many open issues simultaneously. Give all the information needed to take action in one posting - order numbers  issue  etc. You post a few words at a time like a casual chat will never get to your turn.,btohqsg
btw they do the same to everyone. just keep rotating their attention  they wont wait around for replies.,btohqsg
Any proper car wash companies avail now? East side,btohqsg
Anyone want at Kembangan going to Jurong,btohqsg
using my phone to compare the available jobs with my friend’s phone. realised that jobs on our LLM apps are totally different.,btohqsg
Should be almost the same... Just difference in broadcast timing,btohqsg
As in processing of the new orders...,btohqsg
Both 1 min difference in terms of time,btohqsg
i log in mine then took a screenshot and log in to his to take a screenshot,btohqsg
u have to put both phones side by side and compare,btohqsg
and see how jobs are broadcast. u log out log in things will change and the list will be refreshed,btohqsg
But ah... Different also good mah? No?Imagine all broadcast at that very min that very second... A few hundred lala move... Nm la I give 100 la.. 100 lalamove guys bidding for that 1 job...,btohqsg
U die die wanna take your job.. So does the other 99,btohqsg
So it might be a good thing,btohqsg
Even out the chances for individuals who wanna take a job on lalamove,btohqsg
i believe llm have 2-3 different pool of jobs,btohqsg
2nor 3  10 or 20 sets.. Thousands of lalamove are always snatching the jobs... Playing fastest fingers first.The more set of job broadcast the better.,btohqsg
I still missed the old app whereby can filter the area.. now left right up down,btohqsg
theyprobablytook out the filter to give more exposure to town jobs; a lot but most drivers unwilling to do.,btohqsg
Can someone advise me why I do not hv cuddle platform on my systems?,btohqsg
Clear cache and force close ur app first then restart,btohqsg
Did u kena any oddle job cancelled tdy,btohqsg
If so  then tdy u won't b able to take any oddle,btohqsg
No I didn't cancelled any job,btohqsg
I think he meant that were u being cancelled and not u cancelling. Cos even as CS help to cancel  we as drivers will get penalised by being banned for a day b4 we can do any oddle jobs agaib,btohqsg
Yes I do hv 2 CS cancelled that...but that was last 2weeks ago ..I can see any oddle platform on my system since last Thursday,btohqsg
Is LLM slow since 5 pax dine in started,btohqsg
Mid December open up further between SG and MY  LLM sure affected.,btohqsg
Can feel it now. But ok la ... Now can see light at end of tunnel,btohqsg
Covid cases n death slowing down,btohqsg
The moment we all waiting for. Chiong JB petrol  food  grocery  places of interest and MASSAGE.,btohqsg
Dun dare go in also... Wait drive in no car drive out... Johorian starved for 2 years,btohqsg
What kind of cars jb ppl dun steal. I know they like toyota,btohqsg
i think park at Marsiling/Woodlands take bus in safer,btohqsg
at most just take Grab around,btohqsg
I like your idea. Go in dun bring too much cash too,btohqsg
Can buy how much groceries without tax? $400?,btohqsg
bring credit card  cash use for makan and car wash etc. play safe,btohqsg
thats the downside not driving in lol,btohqsg
Dun think so. WFH will be the new norm. Headcount can reduce. Office can reduce... Save a lot money for company.,btohqsg
Anybody got do grab delivery? They say need what insurance thing,btohqsg
Grab will check whether you have commercial motor insurance for your vehicle.,btohqsg
Ask your insurance to add one line to cover food delivery. About $20-$30 extra for NTUC.,btohqsg
Is there something wrong with lalamove app recently… it is like jobs disappearing every 30min intervals,btohqsg
Especially when u refresh.. all those jobs u looking at disappear,btohqsg
Jobs disappearing every 30 mins is adnormal  it usually disappear within few seconds during peak period.,btohqsg
Even now i refreshing for tmr liat,btohqsg
I just now couldn't even get any job,btohqsg
Nowdays llm pattern 1. 45-60mins b4 then come out the jobs. For eg  630 jobs come out 530-545. Then disappear  then ard 6pm come out again  then disappear  then after come out again.,btohqsg
Some days come out 30mins b4,btohqsg
Don't know issit llm  or oddle flow over last min to llm  anyway it's getting harder to catch. I think maybe they don't want let pple stack,btohqsg
If u refresh manually  the advance jobs will disappear then u need to wait for them come out again 😂,btohqsg
Refresh will sort distance frm you,btohqsg
It will also lump say location vendor together,btohqsg
How long does cash out usually take? I placed a cash out order *last* Monday and it's still not in yet?! 🤨,btohqsg
process on sunday 2359  receive on wednesday. monday is the worst day to cash out  longest wait time  9 days.,btohqsg
If I keep seeing this  does it mean the app has problem or I'm banned or smth?,btohqsg
Oddle default service provider is LLM unless the eatery call their own delivery provider to deliver Oddle orders,btohqsg
There is some mechanism in the LLM job list that it does not exceed a certain number of jobs available. jobs will appear in the system 6 days prior to pickup time.11.30pm now u can see a booking for 11.30pm for this Sunday. you will not see this job once u refresh (manually or auto) as this will be parked at the very very bottom of the listIf there is alot of orders  anything beyond a certain timing gets hidden. for example now is 5.30pm Saturday. 6pm orders become red. 6.15pm 6.30pm orders is still orange. if 6.15pm orders are too many (mainly oddle ones actually)  u will not see 6.30pm orders until 5.45pm cos thats when 6.15pm orders turn from orange to red. If a 7pm order appears at this time  please dont refresh the list else u will not see the order once the refresh is done. then u have to patiently wait for the order to appear again which can be triggered by the Oddle account or something else.Good luck securing jobs during peak hours. plan your routes in town wisely so that you will not get love letter or kena app ban due to unintended cancellation.,btohqsg
Thanks for ur explanation. But nowdays  advanced orders don't become red until less than 10mins b4 their pickup time. For example  a 630pm order will be yellow even until 620pm. After that it will disappear and appear again as immediate order if it wasn't taken by any drivers,btohqsg
Lala app not working with WiFi? Mine only update orders on mobile data,btohqsg

LLM Gurus.. I got a question to ask lah.. If 2.4m Van can still see Car Job?,btohqsg
Hi guys  i received a feedback fm lalamove that customer has made a complaint against me regarding late delivery on 26 Nov ard 630pm. I was stuck in a massive traffic jam when i was on my way to perform the pickup. Now lalamove wants me to write a report on why was i late. Have you guys encountered this situation before?,btohqsg
I got be4 and just write ✍ to them. Due traffic jam and how to drive fast la...,btohqsg
Now LLM very prompt on weekly payment. Please keep it up.,btohqsg
Any idea about the art test? I can't seem to find much info. For vaccinated riders/drivers  must we take the RRT?,btohqsg

Want car only go book car and maybe give u van FOC,btohqsg
This is the standard method for booking a car now. Works 100%. Only the newbies will pay the car rate.,btohqsg
After comms the money is just nice for the petrol n earn $0 back,btohqsg
This kind of customer really bway pai say,btohqsg
Nobody who has booked a car at bike price will ever go back to car booking.,btohqsg
Eventually it'd be almost all of them.,btohqsg
Hi noob here  if account gonna suspend any ways to reactivate it? Issit thru live chat?,btohqsg

When i reach the customer place,btohqsg
Once covid ends or restrictions ends if lah shld try living in JB and rent out hdb in singapore and do lalamove...sure money many many😄,btohqsg
But if work delivery be it lalamove grab panda...can choose timing...choose the ones when causeway not jam....this i only imagine never try out before😅,btohqsg
But convert to become malaysian cannot work in singapore for the next few years i believe...cannot have hdb also...and cpf still kena lockup,btohqsg
Cannot afford to do that...just give idea only😅,btohqsg
Think save more than that.  Petrol save . Makan groceries save. Massage entertainment save. Only lose time stuck in jam. .. I  would consider if single no family,btohqsg
Their landed house rent quite cheap. Got personal parking somemo,btohqsg
May the morning breeze bring you coolness  may the morning sun bring you warmth  and may my blessings make you happy today,btohqsg
Hi anyone know when does the festive surcharge start ?,btohqsg
this is for the whole year,btohqsg
Guys  just asking i have swab test at 11.15am by lalamove.. if i come around 2+ still ok right? Coz i got errands to do..,btohqsg
What if customers parcel got 5  lalamove address given all wrong how?,btohqsg
Call back bro and ask for the correct address,btohqsg
The customer ask me to follow the parcel address instead,btohqsg
He told me he will tell LLM,btohqsg
If theres changes on the address maybe theres changes on the pricing also.,btohqsg
Do we need to submit ART test results to LLM?,btohqsg
Hey guys...so any of you sync your Lalamove account for the ART test..as I sync my grab account to it...anyone knows what Lalamove code is to add into sync m,btohqsg
Jialat liao now all use this method to exploit knn,btohqsg
Lol it says need air when delivery so open windows during transit. Cfm alot of air,btohqsg
Not sure if it's on purpose or they select wrong vehicle,btohqsg
High chance is on purpose as there are alot of such cheapskates requesting for this kind of expolit on the jobs listing,btohqsg
Lalamove got swab test?? I went there to collect the ART kits only leh,btohqsg
Got.. every week they ask me go.. but today i cant make it dunno whats goin to happen,btohqsg
I only went to collect  they told me I didn’t even have to submit the test results. Just told to self test every week,btohqsg
Car driver spoil their own market . Bike job car aso take. Dun blame customer. If I customer I aso book bike first see got fish bite the bait,btohqsg
"No. Put walker  then note ""No walker. Only want car"".",btohqsg
"is there an official ""walker""booking? what is the base fee?",btohqsg
"coz after a while they will all book walker then put ""no walker we want bike/car. bring trolley.""",btohqsg
which means they could have just officially booked a car at a lower price. But out of habit  book bike and ask for car  at a higher price.,btohqsg
It seems like  now we cannot see what food they order from oddle. Some time also also dun which shop unless we know the shop address that order. Sian,btohqsg
someone in this chat said earlier that u can see the full list after u accept the order,btohqsg
Ya  so cannot really see clearly b4 want to take order,btohqsg
I just received popup on llm app regarding this.Routine self swab test every 4 daysAcknowledge that you can only do llm if art test is negative.Acknowledge that if positive and you still go do  can get charged in court of law.,btohqsg
The lady whom passed me the kits told me I need not send in my test results when I asked her where to submit the test results. What is going on manz?!?,btohqsg
Quite retarded  other place every week or 2 weeks do 1 time ART. llm need 4 days once. Really sot,btohqsg
But I think If want to save ownself backside  every 4 days do. Take photo with ic and date/time. Keep in an album,btohqsg
If really suay anything can show them,btohqsg
No where stated in LLM on more where we can submit pertaining the tests,btohqsg
Think they don't want to spend the time to sort through submissions,btohqsg
So ownself do ownself keep  kena already ownself protect backside,btohqsg
App not working well? See only 3 orderz,btohqsg
Guys Why when the orders refresh or auto refresh the bulk of it seems to disappear.. cannot be so fast ppl take right? Anyone knows how to fix this?,btohqsg
Ya that one I understand. But  before not like this. Even the low pay ones at this peak hour timing seems to disappear. Smtg is just not right. 🤔,btohqsg
Lol  cancel too much kena suspend or ban for some jobs,btohqsg
Coz i saw some job taken when i bid after that it come out again..,btohqsg
Lots of pattern in the app,btohqsg
Take some time to get the hang of it  n then of cos need some luck for the right job at the right time to appear for u to get it 😂,btohqsg
Hello need helpI rch customer location . But customer said he tried canceling it alot of time but couldn't cancle . Now cust don't want to continue the job . So what do I do next on the app .?,btohqsg
you get a 50% cancellation fee if you called to confirm before setting off.,btohqsg
Bro cust service not available at this timing,btohqsg
I tried to contact them but no avail,btohqsg
Saw the apps they are operating till 10pm,btohqsg
Use phone log as evidence that you tried to call. Contact CS tomorrow.,btohqsg
So I just leave the apps just like that uh,btohqsg

Today wasted almost an hour time for a stupid customer who want to use a car to transfer wine chiller,btohqsg
If cannot fit  just tell him cannot and cancel job n change to mpv or van. Don't waste time there,btohqsg
Or u msg Cs. Take photo,btohqsg
Don't waste time entertain such customers,btohqsg
I usually call and ask what item if I take car job.. if one person cannot take den tell Cs lor,btohqsg
But we need to always agree that customer is always cheapo.. so unless necessary.. don't take job that don't belong to your cat so nobody spoilt the customer la,btohqsg
Necessary means maybe last job to finish mission or you are heading that direction so you take to cover gas,btohqsg
How do u contact CS? Can pass me the number ?,btohqsg

Having trouble on the driver app. Permanently banned after not logging on a couple of months after not activating account at HQ.Have tried sending messages via FB (Lalamove Aamir)  live chat  and Instagram. No response. I note that on FB last post updated was on Oct 15 this year. Since then nothing published.If I'm not able to get my account active again  I'll just have to request for my deposit. Otherwise  I think should just go to TAFEP.Your thoughts?,btohqsg
They shouldn't ban just like that. That's unfair,btohqsg
TAFEP deals with employer/employee issues. You might have to sue lalamove personally as an independent contractor.,btohqsg
go down Ubi Techpark to get it settled,btohqsg
maybe I don't do often they don't prioritris me,btohqsg
No la  everyone same eh. I think is becos nobody needs that cus can 5 person go out liao,btohqsg

I had a weird order today.. I didn't accept any order but the order was assigned to me.. I told CS that I didn't accept (obviously I had to swipe to accept and I definitely didn't do that).End up  it reflected that I was the one who cancelled the order. But in the first place  I didn't even accept the order !,btohqsg
Im new on this just did like 12 orders only. Part time2 .,btohqsg
So like any shifu here can teach some tricks or tips to get good orders or at least earn like 200 in 8-10hrs .,btohqsg
Get a job faster n more consistent result,btohqsg
This happened to me today too. Crown plaza airport appeared on my list while I was on my way to pick up an order in the morning. I tot I overlooked and I rushed to location. Reached location  everything close.Called receiver  receiver said this order was last week order  he didnt order today.Called CS and they blamed me that I didnt read T&C so no claim fee for me. Had a little argument with the CS but i put it to rest since left right front back  still our fault.Told them its the fault of the apps  but they said no its not  it’s my fault for not calling reataurant before proceeding.Few minutes later  $11 was cut from my wallet  called CS and they took like 20mins to solve it. After that they apologies.10mins later  the crown plaza order pops up again on my app.So was it my fault or the apps fault?,btohqsg
