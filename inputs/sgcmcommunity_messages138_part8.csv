I only buy 2nd hand car,btohqsg
I only dare look at 6th hand car and above,btohqsg
I thought we only have 2 hands,btohqsg
That'll be evo9s and type Rs right,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt say. Toyota picnic also leh!,btohqsg
I prefer to buy new car,btohqsg
Change every 3- 4 yrs before the warranty ends,btohqsg
No need to worry about warranty,btohqsg
Interesting question: how often does one generally claim on new car warranties? I would imagine failure rates won‚Äôt be too high (granted of course there are outliers or the occasional failure event),btohqsg
My first day of driving Honda Vezel 2021 model a year ago  I already claim warranty,btohqsg
First day drive my Honda Vezel to work  end up want go home  car totally dead.Hand brake cannot turn off  media player on off on off  cannot turn on engine etc,btohqsg
actually this is why i worry all these fancy fancy gadgets,btohqsg
I need  please support my modding,btohqsg
This the Honda tho  not much fancy thing except the electronic brake.But apparently the battery died??? That‚Äôs what they say but I‚Äôve tried asking my colleague to jump start etc to no avail,btohqsg
And the whole car was glitching out with the electronics  where can dead battery do that ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
not some fancy button for me to flip,btohqsg
Eew foot brake haha  last time I remember I forgot to engage the brake and just stepped out of the car  my car rolled and luckily I noticed and jump in to stop,btohqsg
wa this one is ur fault sioa,btohqsg
i dont drive the tonners but i always walk in between them,btohqsg
Too used to electronic brake mah  when you open door on most modern car  even if you‚Äôre in gear  they will auto engageAt that point in time I rented my friend car for a day also  so blur blur one,btohqsg
this is why u rich i poor,btohqsg
cus i dont drive modern cars,btohqsg
2016 still considered somewhat new ah,btohqsg
iirc they have virtual cockpit as well but not as nice as Audi one,btohqsg
You drive a coe car sir,btohqsg
i drive a non-problematic but uncle car,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I hated when cars go over reliant on electronics even for simple things. Really what‚Äôs wrong with the old school hand brake? It never goes wrong  until recently geniuses pull handbrakes but never pull up fully and assumed handbrake were pulled ü§¶,btohqsg
Actually yeah dead battery causes a lot of glitches in cars,btohqsg
in some cars will have christmas tree on dashboard,btohqsg
change the batt and all fine,btohqsg
the one thing i hate the most in new cars now is,btohqsg
also need tap tap touch screen,btohqsg
Somehow a lot of people supporting Lexus steer by wire tho,btohqsg
But but technology so advance now  you don‚Äôt have to touch. ‚ÄúHey Audi  set driver side aircon to 18 degree‚Äù,btohqsg
Electronic steering  send signal to steer one,btohqsg
I just wanna fiddle the aircon by myself :(,btohqsg
bro uk how hard is it to talk to my Siri,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why you have your wife beside you in driver seat,btohqsg
just to HEY SIRI  PLAY A SONG BY AUDIEN PLEASE,btohqsg
We both touchy touchy each others knob,btohqsg
Can ask your favouriteFzsit beside you,btohqsg
Touch each other knob  up down 360  any direction you desire,btohqsg
Can use it as a shifter as well  if your car automatic  no problem. If your passenger wanna try shifting gear  no problem,btohqsg
dun bring him into the convo,btohqsg
i trying to explain to my friend,btohqsg
no EQP is higher spec of 1.4 TSI,btohqsg
Oh wait Volkswagen EQP is basically higher trim,btohqsg
