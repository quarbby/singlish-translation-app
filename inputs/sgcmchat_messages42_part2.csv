Soranext time kau dapat class 3 import this Daihatsu,btohqsg
Somewhat but to be precise is a Daihatsu Mira Gino,btohqsg
but I just think perodua underated,btohqsg
Luckily the white BMW not the TP BMW,btohqsg
Imagine a few of us buying these and then we bring to Sepang. Like a kapcai car one make series,btohqsg
Also good thing is if go Malaysia have a lot of parts and like there is very little risk of it getting stolen,btohqsg
This is one ugly fked up grille,btohqsg
No lah still in bed lepakking,btohqsg
He put the big Logo on the grille,btohqsg
bro I wanna leave south spine but the Rain like and off,btohqsg
Like why the fk you put the emblem and then still keep the damn standing logo.. and for this generation big emblem is ugly siol,btohqsg
Even can bring to Thailand cus they have a Mira Club there,btohqsg
Stopped raining at NTU side alr what..?,btohqsg
Perodua Kelisa converted to Mira Gino front end,btohqsg
But Kelisa I think they put 1.0L engine instead of the Mira Gino 660cc engine,btohqsg
The process like this. They make a Daihatsu Mira Gino and a Mira Gino 1000  the Gino 1000 export over to Perodua in Msia and then they put the Kelisa face and badges,btohqsg
Gino 1000 is for those ppl that want the small size of the Mira Gino but need bigger engine.,btohqsg
Problem is if want to import  need a car that is manufactured after June 2003,btohqsg
Or may need to put classic plate on it,btohqsg
Mayb the standing logo so small he wna tell ppl he drive a merc,btohqsg
He cfm have something to compensate for..,btohqsg
