If you have a ceramic coating to protect  it's not as bad. If you don't have  then need to constantly maintain it.,btohqsg
Even w ceramic coating u need do maintenance coat to enjoy long lasting protection,btohqsg
The best protection is still.. sheltered carparks HAHAH,btohqsg
Yes  I was refering to not being too worried about the 'water mark' if you have ceramic coating as protection.,btohqsg
Actually w it u still have water marks but not so severe,btohqsg
U do ceramic  nvr protect also same,btohqsg
Ceramic coating is just meant to protect. Annually still need to redo the coating to keep the paint work looking good.,btohqsg
At the end of the day  it's skill 🤭 if no skill yet risk  that's foolish,btohqsg

anyone know where to repair car leather,btohqsg
Yes  can reduce glare  especially when the behind car in high beam  but the blue colour mirror type  not the clear mirror type  I bought mine from taobao  it's really help.,btohqsg
But colour mirror kind means perpetually in anti glare mode,btohqsg
It's clear  cos you are from indoor (slightly darker environment) looking outside.,btohqsg
I never regret using this  so if ppl behind switch on high beam to glare you  totally no impact at all.,btohqsg
I try to find the one I bought and post here.,btohqsg
Nowadays many cars headlights r LED not Halogen one. Super bright like high beam. Cfm not LTA approved. Dangerous too. I can’t even see clearly,btohqsg
I did change my stock yellow colour to white but still halogen 5.5k,btohqsg
⭐️ I found it with the best price! Share with you!😉 |https://s.lazada.sg/s.Y7297,btohqsg
I am using this  Lazada also selling  very effective if ppl like to drive behind you and high beam you.,btohqsg
I also installed a extra red light behind similar to the extra brake light with a on and off switch  ppl try high beam  I just switch on to let him taste his own medicine.,btohqsg
lol  shows as out of stock,btohqsg
Not led nvm. Some cant even bother to dip the lights,btohqsg
Imagine a rav4 w white light and the f*cker tune to the highest level,btohqsg
This one burn only  gg to ur car,btohqsg
Rav4 seems like a nice car ah,btohqsg
If your car can fix this  you can let the behind driver taste it  this is bright!,btohqsg

I tried asking some workshops to install parts which I bought outside like Hella horns etc but they don’t do for me due to warranty,btohqsg

U can contact auto trend  very friendly boss and staff.,btohqsg
