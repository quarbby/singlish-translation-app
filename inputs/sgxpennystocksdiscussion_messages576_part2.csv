Recently  covered Vividthree numerous times when it was below $0.050 as you could somehow feel the ongoing hidden buying although no news.(Note: Sometimes  no news but counter inching up slowly with hidden buying could mean that there might some early leak of inside/potential news)Anyways  have noticed some positive PA on Healthway Medical. I wonder why too. Maybe time will tell. Also  Asiamedic looks really well supported at $0.017. They used to move together. Let’s see if there might be some upcoming news for these 2.,btohqsg
Healthway vs Asiamedic on the weekly charts. Recently  there have been some volume that have started to come into these 2 counters. Somehow  I feel like something is cooking. Just my gut  perhaps can watchlist first.DYODD,btohqsg

🚀Pika World Daily Updates- 23 Nov 2021🚀🍎Consumer spending critical for the longevity of bull market💸Inflation has not deterred consumers from feeling miserable. There is genuinece concern that the high inflation expectation may crystalize into weaker economic growth. One could point to the Consumer Sentiments from the University of Michigan  which showed a fall in early November  the lowest level in a decade.Examining the figures revealed a more worrisome trend. About 25% of the US households see potential deterioration in their financial situation  the highest level since 2008. More importantly  50% of the respondents felt that the economy had recently weakened and could continue in a downward trend next year. Surprisingly  60% of consumers thought difficult financial situations were likely to remain for the next 5 years.Goldman Sachs economists had predicted that the fall in the sentiments could translate to a 0.4% decline in fourth-quarter consumption growth  which is the driver of the bulk of the GDP. In addition  while October sales have been rosy  there is an assumption that consumers are shopping early for their needs and that this may contribute to a weaker retail sales reading ahead.Central bankers are generally worried that consumers might accelerate their spending in anticipation of higher prices. That is  if we do see actual price shaping inflation expectation  the actual inflation figure may drive higher  leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy. However  a sign of comfort is that inflation expectation maintains at 2.9% based on the Michigan survey. This implies that consumers believe in the transitory inflation narrative and trust that the price increase will likely moderate next year.As inflation scare is back into the game  Pika World will be observing the trends and their implication on corporate earnings and the resultant outlook for the equity market.⏰All eyes on the Fed Chair Nomination🎙As we move closer to Thanksgiving Day  there is growing anticipation on who will be the next Fed chairman. However  the week is quiet one given that the market is closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving  followed by a half trading day on Friday.While we expect many economic data to be released  ranging from jobless claims  FOMC policy committee meeting minutes  and core personal consumption expenditure data  the main highlight is still the Fed chair candidate.It is heartening to see our favourite Uncle Powell been chosen as the Fed Chairman for another term. This certainty provides comfort for the market.📮What's on the menu today?At 10.45 pm  we will have the Manufacturing PMI (Nov)  which stands at 59.0  up from 58.4. Likewise  service PMI is expected to rise to 59.0 from 58.4 in the prior period.It is 23 Nov  Tuesday  at 8.10 am in Singapore and 8.10 pm in New York. It has been a great start to the week  and we hope all Pika World friends a prosperous week ahead!,btohqsg
