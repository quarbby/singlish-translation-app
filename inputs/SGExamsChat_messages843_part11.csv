seeing profs struggle with setting up projector,btohqsg
ü§£ü§£ü§£ i like the idea of mail merge as an extra feature but i really cannot get used to using it myself,btohqsg
then end up struggling without asking for help  delaying the start of lessons time especially when they arrived late  or end up asking someone in class or call IT dept for staff supportü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
result in class dismissal being later,btohqsg
i mean i more so was speaking from uni perspective which is like,btohqsg
they have to end on time or ppl will just leave anyway,btohqsg
Mood when the projector cant even be seen irl or in recording,btohqsg
but i heard it depends on how the prof prefers to work with lectures / labs in general,btohqsg
lessons in labs work more straightforward because you can only go at a certain time where the class booked a time slot for lessons i thinklessons at lecture halls or smth are more lax compared to class labs,btohqsg
at least the general situation would be as such,btohqsg
more so depends on the major,btohqsg
and also the location of where they can get lessons booked st,btohqsg
no one cares if participation isn't a grading factor,btohqsg
can someone give a razor simplified explanation on reddit comment karma,btohqsg
i came back after a few days of being inactive and saw my comment karma jumping to 103 from 20-30~ last i checked???,btohqsg
i still don't understand the reddit guides  like i can read novellas but not this...,btohqsg
maybe you got downvoted to oblivion,btohqsg
likely because a bunch of people found whatever you commented relatable  useful  or entertaining,btohqsg
or it‚Äôs the reddit hivemind doing its thing,btohqsg
idk eh cause my top few most downvoted comments were somehow mainly from r/sgexams üòì,btohqsg
probably this because i don't understand how reddit post + comment karma algorithm changes every now and then,btohqsg
don‚Äôt have to worry much about it tbh  karma‚Äôs all just imaginary internet points,btohqsg
on the topic of reddit  is it just me or does r/singaporeraw seem super negative most of the time,btohqsg
i prefer to cultivate and accumulate real karma for my personal karmic life debts,btohqsg
lol i don't consider myself too personally religious,btohqsg
i like the concept of karmic debts  samsara ( cycle of reincarnations ) etc and a lot of more sanskrit / buddhism / taoism concepts i got to know in my fictional novel reading journey,btohqsg
wtf how many accounts does this dude have,btohqsg
half of the jobs will be cut,btohqsg
what is antidepressants? mentioned by CNA ...,btohqsg
yesterday morning  there were a bunch of different accounts sending the same ad that somehow got past the auto filtering system,btohqsg
got brain rot reading F**'s opinion on global affairs on SG Exams Discord ü§£,btohqsg
Hi need help for AMath. how to get the ans?,btohqsg
I think u need to draw out the sin curve to visualize,btohqsg
or memorize the values  which most students dont?,btohqsg
if you draw out the triangle  sin(30 degrees) = 1/2,btohqsg
then you look at the sin curve  if sin(30 degrees) = 1/2  then sin(-30 degrees) = -1/2,btohqsg
a lot of principal value questions can be solved by remembering SOHCAHTOA and then drawing out what that triangle would look like,btohqsg

President being blur sotong or secret invasion from North Korea about to launch nukes,btohqsg
so does this mean you cannot travel,btohqsg
are you reading Jackson or smth,btohqsg
martial law probably affects those who have the capability or skill set of fighting  i think...personally haven't gotten to read any articles on this yet but their SK* laws are getting more ridiculous because why are they coming up with newer laws as compared to making further adjustments / reforms to their Employment Laws ( Particularly those in the Entertainment Circle & Healthcare Industry ) or those general protection guideline section for the Public Servants / Workers IN South Korea??? like bruh( * SK = South Korea  cause no one knows wtf is going on in North Korea unless Kim Jung Un wants to disclose such relevant information ),btohqsg
I heard a quote on this,btohqsg
"""The closer the collapse of an empire  the crazier its laws""",btohqsg
i mean if that yt comments were to mean something  its just a salty leader that decided to enact the only law that could help him in his eyes,btohqsg
all i see is the user start with F and his opinions about global affairs and got brain rot from it,btohqsg
