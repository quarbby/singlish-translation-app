Anyone familiar with WISE here? Is it better to link WISE to Credit Card? Every transfer money is charge at hw many $?,btohqsg
For credit/debit card there is 3.15%/3.09% fee  use PayNow to fund is free,btohqsg
Transfer to their bank account method is also free,btohqsg
Sorry noob question for Amaze. It is mostly good for overseas spending only right? If local spending  might as well use the credit card directly?Or am I mistaken?,btohqsg
If I use Krispay or shopback to pay in a restaurant  will I still get the 4mpd or 8% Rebate for solitare card and maybank family and friends card?,btohqsg
People use it for CRMC because it converts offline transaction into online type. Thus enable 4mpd.People also use it to confirm MCC of merchant.,btohqsg
Means transfer from debit account to wise?,btohqsg
Transfer from your bank account  add Wise as payee  when you choose bank transfer on their app they will show you their bank account number to transfer to,btohqsg

Hi morning. I am trying to setup google pay so that I can use on kris+ app. Been using Google pay for some time and no issue  now wanted to link to kris+ and start using kris to make payment. I had issue linking to gpay then I removed my card and tried to add back my card to gpay. But now google is saying that my identity cannot be verified  asking to upload documents to verify identity. Does anyone have similar encounter and how long it takes to resolve?,btohqsg

Hi all  for CardUp  the total amount charged to the credit card is eligible for rewards right.For example  if I use Maybank Platinum Visa Card and the payment amount keyed in to CardUp is $1965  based on the current CardUp promo fee of 1.85% for Visa cards  I will be charged $2001.35.Meaning to say  I will qualify (based on the latest T&C) for Maybank's quarterly cash rebate of $200 (assuming I will charge this $2001.35 per month for the entire quarter).,btohqsg
Hi for the UOB Preferred Platinum Visa  for the 4mpd  I assume if you load up onto your Apple Wallet without using the physical card it still counts?,btohqsg
You should not use physical PPV card because you won’t get 4mpd. Only mobile contactless gets 4mpd so ya definitely load into your phone and paywave with phone.,btohqsg

Hello Experts Can I have feedback on my understanding below if I want to maximize the interest earned for HSBC EGA:1. Opened account in April 2024 and registered by SMS for HSBC EGA promo in April 2024 - hence I will earn bonus interest for April and May 2024.2. On 31 May 2024  I have to move my funds from HSBC EGA to somewhere else and leave only minimum balance throughout month June 2024 to avoid penalty.3. On 1 Jul 2024  I have to SMS to register for the July bonus interest promo and put back my fund inside EGA. My incremental ADB that will earn bonus interest will be against month June 2024 balance.4. Leave the fund for 2 months (July and Aug) to earn the bonus interest.5. Repeat step 2 above on 31 Aug 2024.,btohqsg
