i rmb haze period at home a few days with e learning,btohqsg
1 week worth of stuff can be done in 2hrs,btohqsg
i never say i scared of workload,btohqsg
idm doing the same amt of work,btohqsg
as long as they allow me to shut myself in,btohqsg
if schools shut  workplaces will also shut,btohqsg
in other words  unless we are very close to dorscon red  it wont shut,btohqsg
dont think it will shut soon ba,btohqsg
Best if school n work continues,btohqsg
Yea i dont think will shut,btohqsg
NS will shut down before schools shut down ðŸ¥´,btohqsg
NS will def not shut down,btohqsg
I doubt both will come anywhere close to shutting down anyway,btohqsg
NS is a fragment of public defense  not it's entirety,btohqsg
It is basically the entirety of defence,btohqsg
i would say close to entirety  rather than associating it with a fragment,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure NS is more commonly used to address the 2 years service rather than the entirety of our defense force,btohqsg
I don't think it encompasses people who has ORD-ed or are regulars,btohqsg
i think ng eng hen has addressed it clearly,btohqsg
National service = NS + ORNS + MR cycles,btohqsg
The service is made almost entirely of NSF and NSmen,btohqsg
When u ROD they say ur NS liabilities have ended,btohqsg
u havent serve or still in service is it LOLOLOL,btohqsg
One interesting fact I learn in army,btohqsg
Hmm  I'm wrong then Corrected statement: They will cease the 2 year cycle of NS before schools shut down,btohqsg
Great but feeling sore in the throat,btohqsg
NS will never stop no matter what happens,btohqsg
Its a fundamental institution in SG,btohqsg
I think a socially responsible government will realise that the living conditions and circumstances of NS makes the COVID much more easier to spread as compared to schools,btohqsg
A responsible gov will know you cannot compromise defence  ever,btohqsg
They can SOL everyone in tekong,btohqsg
Then confirm the recruit won't kena,btohqsg
They can just confine everyone in camp lol,btohqsg
Tekong becomes the safest place in Singapore,btohqsg
No where in the NS act says that ppl need bookout,btohqsg
Last time BMT was 3+ mths confinement,btohqsg
anyone doing accounting in uni rn,btohqsg
Kazakhstan schools closed for 2 month and more,btohqsg
Is don't do a degree in it,btohqsg
The 3rd gen RSAF; full spectrum  integrated  ready,btohqsg
Did u get brainwashed in the talk,btohqsg
That's the thing  they can commit towards ensuring that the current cycle is safe  but they'll have to delay future cycles because they can't confirm the new recruits won't kena,btohqsg
Those in camp training one how,btohqsg
More so than army and air force,btohqsg
But air force is first line of defence during real war,btohqsg
Ok la stop talking about tekong,btohqsg
i thought the cyber hacking ppl is the first line of defence,btohqsg
Well wasn't it SGDating here for 30mins yday,btohqsg
It depends on the country's characteristics,btohqsg
