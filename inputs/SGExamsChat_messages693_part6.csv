Guys guys why didn't you all tried freezing your heart,btohqsg
dayum mbad I thought you're somewhat who's been chatting,btohqsg
Nono I did replied to correct msg,btohqsg
I think right for those who don’t like durian can freeze those less pungent varieties,btohqsg
I was kind of taken aback lol I was thinking what was so offensive about that,btohqsg
I mean idt I've chatted w u before,btohqsg
idk u shld do it first then tell us if u become anna,btohqsg
idrmb if you're the one who helped me w Econs abit,btohqsg
I think you got reply to at least some of my messages here since I’ve been rather active since I came in here like 3 weeks ago,btohqsg
But yeah I answer a lot of Econs stuff in the other chat,btohqsg
Ooh then it's prob you ig,btohqsg
I don't understand jack abt foreign exchange tbh.,btohqsg
But Econs B for As :(,btohqsg
But shit happens sometimes I guess  some ppl I know with a super good content knowledge for Econs still somehow get B for As,btohqsg
Are you planning to take econs in uni?,btohqsg
Internal exams including prelims always A but then a levels somehow B,btohqsg
But I’ll be meeting my Econs tutor to discuss,btohqsg
Egg did you not get A for econs lol,btohqsg
Source : U in prelims to A in econs (h1 only tho),btohqsg
so we do well for things we hate,btohqsg
I hated it the most but got A,btohqsg
Weird i hate physics so much but im not doing well,btohqsg
I’ll take it as a yes,btohqsg
Yeah same I was looking at the 2022 paper and realised I was fucked,btohqsg
But got A in the end,btohqsg
Also geog I studied less for it than Econs  anyhow whack but I guess a level geog doesn’t expect much,btohqsg
Randkmdkd probably wishes h2 geog was harder,btohqsg
Probably the best in geog in the whole sgexams chat,btohqsg
he goeg god or gp god? im so conused,btohqsg
GP there’s probably a few good ones  but geog he’s the undisputed geog god here,btohqsg
My brother I consider him a GP god but he ain’t here lol,btohqsg
He took h3 lit and got dist somehow,btohqsg
But ofc his GP is undeniably good,btohqsg
Nah there’s more qualified ppl I think,btohqsg
Like those who alr finish uni,btohqsg
But after that B for a levels I’m seriously considering not becoming an Econs Cher,btohqsg
At this point I’m quite lost on what to do,btohqsg
Maybe if I retake h2 Econs only this year to chase the A I’ll try to make myself hate it,btohqsg
I like the complexity in Econs  it just feels interesting,btohqsg
Unlike math which is more abstract,btohqsg
