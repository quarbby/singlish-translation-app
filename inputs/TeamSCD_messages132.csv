But how long can u keep the car in sg?,btohqsg
Just that the carplate I think need buy,btohqsg
No la I don't live in sg,btohqsg
Just go back for a spin eat some laksa and drive back,btohqsg
Normally ppl from Singapore drive to Malaysia to eat,btohqsg
You drive to Singapore to eat,btohqsg
Food outside your own country = exotic,btohqsg
I tot this one is fly in one,btohqsg
Cos cannot drive in malaysia ma,btohqsg
I thought should be quite straight forward,btohqsg
you wanna drive to germany also can,btohqsg
how to drive all the way there sia,btohqsg
Got 2 angmor take proton wira  put the taxi livery,btohqsg
they drive to germany tia noschleife,btohqsg
https://www.wapcar.my/news/malaysia-boleh-%E2%80%93-proton-wira-teksi-takes-on-the-nurburgring-4793Oh no i kena scam. I thought they drove from Malaysia all the way to germany,btohqsg
I mixed up the stories.This is then the guy that drove from Malaysia to Germanyhttps://mothership.sg/2019/08/malaysia-drive-to-germany/,btohqsg
I want to jio for a certain drive but i dunno how many will be keen,btohqsg
i drive to tuas already kpkb liao hahahah,btohqsg
I everyday drive to ipoh tho,btohqsg
But come to think of it. Can my car take it?,btohqsg
As long as its within 1 servicing,btohqsg
Otherwise u have to look for servicing workshops halfway,btohqsg
Means service and prep then start,btohqsg
But he wanted to go for mango sticky rice,btohqsg
i see gears and gasoline they ownself change oil,btohqsg
Wha long time no see this feller,btohqsg
i say gears and gasoline nia,btohqsg
I keep watching their road trip videos  i also wanna go road trip,btohqsg
Sit grab  will vomit blood. With the driver keep braking,btohqsg
and they change oil in the carpark within 10min,btohqsg
Ya those videos nice to watch,btohqsg
U also can. But in sg. Where to dispose the oil is the issue,btohqsg
I don't think I trust myself to service the car,btohqsg
I heard my friend say can call ppl come collect the oil,btohqsg
My ex colleague he will change oil in the carpark,btohqsg
Can. But small amount i don think worth it,btohqsg
Old oil go back into the bottle then dispose at bike shop,btohqsg
The trick with rx8 is if u go high rpm all the way u burn oil and replace,btohqsg
So u never need to full change,btohqsg
Or you can pass your oil to@chloetherx8,btohqsg
Oh pls  Chloe only drinks Trust Greddy F3,btohqsg
Only got Castrol edge in mine,btohqsg
I rmb this story my friend told me,btohqsg
He met a customer that drove an audi,btohqsg
he say the guy nv changes oil,btohqsg
anyone gg hdc car meet today?,btohqsg
Ok technically u still should la,btohqsg
For a moment I saw HDL car meet,btohqsg
I mean theres no way it ever burns until clean,btohqsg
yeah and they guy continued till CEL came up and came to my friend,btohqsg
my friend see alr he dk how to advise,btohqsg
Actually weekdays you don't meet like your other car friends?,btohqsg
Technically can strip engine and port polish lor,btohqsg
I used to la. But damn shag,btohqsg
Hai di lao car meet ?,btohqsg
Work  family  exercise  a bit of gaming time  koon,btohqsg
Exercise the one thing I can never do,btohqsg
But this period I'm seldom there,btohqsg
And the wall climbing thing and a couple of dance schools,btohqsg
Usually if the day after@ishengjiewashed the car then I'll park in aperia,btohqsg
Pay a bit more parking to keep it clean an extra day or 2,btohqsg
After that outdoor parking until chui then send back,btohqsg
I gave up  now i just semi frequently wipe down with water and cloth,btohqsg
Once in a while go groomer for one times good one,btohqsg
Because I park outside it's $10 max... Aperia I think will be $14 or $15,btohqsg
It's the bird shit that is a pain,btohqsg
This one regardless of color is fk,btohqsg
Car cover in dust still ok... But got bird shit then I'll go water jet on the way home,btohqsg
I keep a spray bottle in the boot for that,btohqsg
Whack with water then use wet tissue give finish,btohqsg
Yeah if no choice have to do that,btohqsg
It comes off wraps more easily than paint/wax,btohqsg
Bird shit on paint/coat like sibeh hard to scrape away,btohqsg
Worst when it lands on rubber,btohqsg
Got once kena  then when you clean you don't know is shit coming off or rubber,btohqsg
Birds these days really too much,btohqsg
Some of them are top gun pilots,btohqsg
I kena snipe by birdshit once while driving expressway,btohqsg
Smack in the middle of my sunroof,btohqsg
Last time ns time  there this station we will walk from  the moment you come out  maverick and goose attacks you,btohqsg
Until we resort to using umbrella,btohqsg
But in terms of bird attack we all lose to nekonekzy,btohqsg
No escape... They camp at the lamp post,btohqsg
Then drop bombs the moment people walk,btohqsg
There something about the CL7 backside that is very man,btohqsg
The last word idk how to pronounce jialat,btohqsg
Ya the tail light  his spoiler very subtle,btohqsg
Accord cannot put big wing one,btohqsg
can but the car must be damn tiong,btohqsg
Accord has this mature and grounded gentleman look,btohqsg
Like my power is there but not for showboating,btohqsg
@weeweeyouoyoushow your one with the wing....,btohqsg
Accord very suitable for wbk sia,btohqsg
really depends on the colour  whether got front lip  etc,btohqsg

Confirm will kena overtake one. lol.,btohqsg
Im a safe driver. Just feel bad when he cannot overtake me cos 1 lane lol,btohqsg
After merged to PIE  next thing i saw is that he is on lane 1,btohqsg
Lolx....as long within the speed limit...I think not Ur fault mah,btohqsg
one day want to drive to thailand :),btohqsg
got quite a few on the market,btohqsg
but everyone of them is different from each other,btohqsg
That the fun of customing one carüòÇ,btohqsg
Same car different outlook n performance üòÇ,btohqsg
The circular rear lights very sexy,btohqsg
I think its the straight lines that make it special,btohqsg
I went up once. never again,btohqsg
i want the circle of a skyline,btohqsg
Circle rear lights are damn sexy,btohqsg
if black out the lights .... woah,btohqsg
The slope transitions there are for suv and lorry sia,btohqsg
hopefully can get cl7 as first car,btohqsg
There's a hump on the roof  i almost stuck my swift there.,btohqsg
their a bit pricy right now,btohqsg
Depre is not that high. But your maintenance will be fwee weet,btohqsg
was lucky when i got mine,btohqsg
but price will increase in future right,btohqsg
I snaked it and still scraped,btohqsg
this one no one will know,btohqsg
U need more to get scrapped first,btohqsg
yall think ct9a evos will ever go back down?,btohqsg
1 year before ICE phase out,btohqsg
maybe by then i got the money,btohqsg
2040..only no new ICE cars selling..old ones still have on the roads deüòÇ,btohqsg
From current situation....it seem to be that way,btohqsg
Wah like that price sure skyrocket,btohqsg
But maybe left 5 petrol kiosk in sg,btohqsg
Lolx .....dunno abt the future...I m happy to enjoy driving one now can liai,btohqsg
I was behind an ioniq 5 this morning,btohqsg
God it looks like a soulless piece of shit,btohqsg
curious to see what battery technology we will have by then tho,btohqsg
i think it looks nice eh,btohqsg
Tesla‚Äôs design was they gave a 3 year old crayon and asked them to outline a car,btohqsg
I drive becoz it is shiok to drive...not becoz it is fast,btohqsg
You know what ev feels like now ?Imagine like got super heros and all. Ev are like the bot controlled ai robots. lol,btohqsg
Its the world‚Äôs most generic design,btohqsg
Singapore roads..how fast wan to beüòÇ,btohqsg
Just to confirm  5 is the SUV right,btohqsg
Cos it was an suv i saw,btohqsg
i waiting for kia ev6 to reach sg,btohqsg
the front looks like a mask,btohqsg
It looks like it was designed by a robot,btohqsg
i mean the ev6 looks more like a normal car than the ioniq 5,btohqsg
And why all SUV shapes now for fucks sake,btohqsg
i appreciate all cars  i dont judge,btohqsg
Will it kill them to make an ev that looks like a fd3s,btohqsg
I mean just the shell  and put your cursed ev and battery,btohqsg
i think someone ev swapped an fd3s,btohqsg
The only EV i'll ever consider is honda E,btohqsg
A fit sized car for the price of a quattroporte,btohqsg
The n fusion 74 looks cool tho,btohqsg
I wont want to drive an RC car on the road,btohqsg
i think u just havent reach the old uncle age yet de,btohqsg
Personally won‚Äôt go EV if I have a choice too. Exhaust and engine sounds too impt alr,btohqsg
but later on cfm u will fold,btohqsg
Ev under the hood of an fd2r,btohqsg
"""knn why this car so loud""",btohqsg
Or maybe there just wont be parts to replace anymore,btohqsg
i think i'd be roling in a V8 luxury sedan,btohqsg
I'd rather be seen in this,btohqsg
Tsk so eco unfriendly. Drive a 1.3 L like me,btohqsg
but your 1.3 drinks same amount of fuel as a V8,btohqsg
I dont think lexus burns oil,btohqsg
but yeah  it definitely uses more engine oil cos duhhh bigger engine,btohqsg
We are helping to move the world away from fossil fuels,btohqsg
the faster we can put an end to global warming,btohqsg
Then i can EV swap my rx8 and blast the brap sound from my speakers,btohqsg
Just imagine  all the torque without the wear and tear  all the brap without the engine mount replacements,btohqsg
you sound like you want an EV now,btohqsg
the fun part is not knowing whether the car will survive the next pull or not,btohqsg
Just enjoy the petrol price first,btohqsg
Rotary even piang will still pull,btohqsg
but maybe slower than running speed,btohqsg
idk if u watch rob dahm,btohqsg
dk how fked alr still can run,btohqsg
The triangle still spins  the wheels not so much,btohqsg
"in a sense it's still ""reliable""",btohqsg
Rotary must maintain can already. Dont listen to the naysayers,btohqsg
At least it wont show CEL then have you stranded in front of the traffic light like most VW cars,btohqsg
U piang a piston engine there is no limp,btohqsg
Eh  but the funny thing is that decathlon golf,btohqsg
he limped back to workshop with 3 cylinders,btohqsg
That one not really piang ba,btohqsg
i heard his block has a hole,btohqsg
if got one hole at the side of the block how,btohqsg
wah can ah like the at,btohqsg
got a guy that went to the same workshop saw the car,btohqsg
then the mechanic says it needs a new engine. Nothing can be reused,btohqsg
Toyota still has the best block for boosting,btohqsg
the cylinder walls macham wall maria,btohqsg
you need an armoured titan to piang it,btohqsg
The block is made of wall bruh,btohqsg
To have a hole in the block,btohqsg
3 cylinders you can drive  but not advised,btohqsg
the car will move with less power and very rough,btohqsg
25% of the fuel is being thrown into the cat,btohqsg
Dont need long before the cat also need to replace,btohqsg
But that golf is back on the road tho,btohqsg
That means there was a engine from a scrap car,btohqsg
thats why the solution is to decat,btohqsg
So many golfs being scrapped each day,btohqsg
my old kia  when a coil died  i just drive to workshop,btohqsg
When the gbox and tranny are 70% the value of the car  u can be sure,btohqsg
VW replace 1 gearbox i can overhaul my apex seals 3 times. And ppl say rx8 scary,btohqsg
thats why i always thought if i got one  i would be able to keep it alive with proper maintaince,btohqsg
Actually can ah. Nothing to hesitate or what,btohqsg
yeah but that time has passed already,btohqsg
Someone come from normal sedan maybe will culture shock,btohqsg
yeah it will drive  but make that drive to the workshop and no where else,btohqsg
The only time it passes is when there are none on the market,btohqsg
Imo the $200 tow truck will be much cheaper than the additional damage done,btohqsg
mine that time was just a dead coil,btohqsg
engine piang i also suggest tow truck,btohqsg
Dead coil honestly i worry more for the cat than the engine,btohqsg
good to have spare coils around,btohqsg
Unless u decat in which case  can tie a zippo to your tailpipe and watch the rocket flames,btohqsg
so i keep the cat stock,btohqsg
But rx8 even without decat still got like go kart smell,btohqsg
I put premix or not also have the smell,btohqsg
As in u smell the car before u hear it,btohqsg
i dont think u will like the starlet smell,btohqsg
Bruh. Any of the sg car meets now,btohqsg
everyone ask me why put stock cat,btohqsg
but that smell is more important to me then performance,btohqsg
need to take my highflow cat from my friend and try see if got smell,btohqsg
the smell is ok when ur in a good mood,btohqsg
but after a long tiring day,btohqsg
i rather just sit at petrol station and smell fuel,btohqsg
hear the cold start and smell the smoke,btohqsg
no wonder u hate evs with a passion,btohqsg
sir roi what time u going back from giant later,btohqsg
i can come down let u smell my starlet fumes,btohqsg
i can even bring stool for u,btohqsg
I dont even know if i'm going to giant,btohqsg
I have a friend looking for it,btohqsg
unless u wanna prank him then go for it ah,btohqsg
i dont follow starlets that much,btohqsg
at one point in life  i wanted one,btohqsg
used to have that generation starlet during my childhood days... thats why when we got this one my dad say cannot let go,btohqsg
starlet was the first car he bought for my mom,btohqsg
this one got real sporty look to it,btohqsg
I rmb this story i heard from my friend,btohqsg
When he met his wife when they started dating,btohqsg
she was driving an NA MX5,btohqsg
then they married  got kids and they had to sell the car,btohqsg
but the husband promised to buy a MX5 back for her eventually,btohqsg
He bought the ND gen couple years back for the wife,btohqsg
But the wife drive a few years and said it's enough and decided to sell it,btohqsg
now the wife driving Megane RS,btohqsg
idk if there's any new megane,btohqsg
i saw one parked at tp hangar when i was still in school,btohqsg
but it's been around for a few years also alr,btohqsg
maybe@NelsonLeong89will one day drive a starlet,btohqsg
This car they no plans of selling it yet  cos it's just that great he said,btohqsg
something about a hot hatch man,btohqsg
He ownself drives a Volvo SUV,btohqsg
Heard the reliability not good tho,btohqsg
I think renaults are fine  but rare until parts cannot find,btohqsg
really meh  had an ex colleague the car forever in the workshop,btohqsg
but if F1 has taught us anything  Mercedes are damn reliable lol,btohqsg
i go workshop always got mercedes on the hoist,btohqsg
the engine in my old cerato really didn't give me any trouble for the 2 years i had it,btohqsg
the car generally was pretty reliable  it was just slow,btohqsg
and was known for ecu failure,btohqsg
the one that looked like a jaguar,btohqsg
right after warranty over the gearbox circuit board fried,btohqsg
Komoco didnt cover cos warranty over,btohqsg
wanna sell the car also lose so much to depreciation,btohqsg
That car really became a big problem,btohqsg
my family didn't touch hyundai ever since,btohqsg
but the taxi sonata i ever saw one that wasn't a taxi.  It can look very gangster,btohqsg
Before this she was driving an accord. I vaguely remember the car,btohqsg
and also  the hyundai tuscani also like dead?,btohqsg
Last time so common on the road,btohqsg
thats the same as the taxi,btohqsg
Those that wants their car to become a sticker  do send me ur photos. But ofc need to be smth that I can interact with. HAHA,btohqsg
i tried talking to the photos  but they didn't answer me,btohqsg
U dont need la. U have a whole miata sticker pack to urself. HAHAHA,btohqsg
Beside the Merc will be a lorry with the cab open,btohqsg
But that's where they earn  from doing the general stuff,btohqsg
they need jobs from all industry oso,btohqsg

i think accord looks great in red hahaq,btohqsg

I also thought of the Cl1 Mugen wing,btohqsg
