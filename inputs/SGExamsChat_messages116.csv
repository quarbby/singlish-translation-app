It is quite annoying when you are walking to school and there‚Äôs this row of people trying to get your attention,btohqsg
But yeah I guess it‚Äôs not as bad as this,btohqsg
At my school they line up from the gate to across the zebra crossing about 30m from the gate,btohqsg
The pathway is narrow too so it‚Äôs not so easy to escape,btohqsg

unfortunately the singapore government does not actually possess evas,btohqsg
I cannot believe if this is official,btohqsg
they probably got a weeb to draw it,btohqsg
I only had the other one,btohqsg
But it seems that AFTC is the most cultured command in the RSAF,btohqsg
if cmpb plays their cards right yall might get a very dank memepage to add to that collection of culture too,btohqsg
Fuck lack of affection! All my homies have a lack of affection,btohqsg
until today idk what blanket party is,btohqsg
The wrapping up in blanket sounds comfy though,btohqsg
It's pretty good if you have a huge blanket,btohqsg
It shouldn't be taboo to bring a blanket instead of a jacket into libraries,btohqsg
does anyone that have or knows where to get free prelim papers except sgfreepapers,btohqsg
I would if my blanket wasn‚Äôt vast enough to hit the floor,btohqsg

So this is the power of affirmative action,btohqsg
You can hardly find any white people in the pic  even though white people are the majority in the US,btohqsg

What is the point of creation?Lord Allah whyüå±üåª,btohqsg
What's the point of life to you,btohqsg
anyone kind enough to try out my bot,btohqsg
I think there are still a few bugs,btohqsg
okay i see you tried searching for fx,btohqsg
I'm not sure how investments are supposed to work,btohqsg
But it just loads indefinitely lol,btohqsg
oh thats because no support for fx yet,btohqsg
like AAPL  GOOG  AMZN that kinda stuff,btohqsg
i will definitely look into fx,btohqsg
and looks like my api limit is maxed out,btohqsg
"ank you for using Alpha Vantage! Our standard API call frequency is 5 calls per minute and 500 calls per day. Please visithttps://www.alphavantage.co/premium/if you would like to target a higher API call frequency.""",btohqsg
guess this api isnt the best for much use,btohqsg
but thanks for testing at least i know the db works,btohqsg
yeah its a python graph HAHA,btohqsg
but its reliant on the api which has a 5 calls/min limit...,btohqsg
As long as no one spams it should be alright,btohqsg
not sure its worth paying for more apis,btohqsg
Like from the time I click to when I get the graph,btohqsg
Yeah but not sure if there's anything you can do about that,btohqsg
cause it passes through a few commands like retrieving data and plotting the graph etc. etc.,btohqsg
but definitely something i can look at to streamline,btohqsg
Erm also there's no way to see the stocks which I have saved?,btohqsg
its giving a lot of errors,btohqsg
cause i dont really have fx included yet,btohqsg
thanks haha i realised my code to prevent duplication didnt work somehow even though it was fine in local,btohqsg
Right okay it works I guess,btohqsg
yeah but when you added jpy it stopped the favourites function,btohqsg
Just need to make sure people don't input a stock that is not implemented I guess,btohqsg
yeah have to add in indexes and fx,btohqsg
I shan't disturb your bot anymore,btohqsg
But wonder why it crashed when I added in JPY and not some random 4 letter word,btohqsg
You need to exchange 5 $2 for 2 $5 not one $2 for one $5,btohqsg
I initially thought it's one piece for one piece and not the corresponding values,btohqsg
The image only shows AFM in the class,btohqsg
That makes a lot more sense,btohqsg
Does anyone know whether library book drop is open by any chance?,btohqsg

Pes c people have way too much time,btohqsg
I wish spf had it too,btohqsg
maybe coz it is not a useful degree? I've watched videos where people explained how majoring in gender studies get you almost no where LOL but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ diff ppl diff opinions I guess,btohqsg
hohoho got someone agree w me,btohqsg
but yea basically I've watched some videos where this guy explains how certain college degrees are useful/not useful in the US (may be applicable to sg too) and he listed out a few degrees such as gender studies  communications  and also a few really niche ones such as art history etc.,btohqsg
comms art hist more useful than gender studies imo,btohqsg
They say gender degree may work alongside psychology or business  but by itself Abit hard to find job,btohqsg
but im not gonna take such degrees anyways so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ,btohqsg
every company needs a comms major,btohqsg
art hist is good for country's culture,btohqsg
to clarify  not every  but many  need copywriters and marketers and PR people,btohqsg
it's like teaching capitalism or socialism as a major,btohqsg
shouldnt be a degree in the first place,btohqsg
to clarify more  gender studies is rooted in left-libertarian politics  imagine saying communism should be taught as a major in university  would sound ridiculous and there would be public outrage,btohqsg
i actually expected an interesting rebuttal to my argument or something,btohqsg
Man my internal clock is so fucked,btohqsg
So you are  so to speak  without holes?,btohqsg
Guys anyone of y‚Äôall have 2019 tys physics answer?,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt seem to find my answer key,btohqsg
Njc doesn't offer hsp dsa :(,btohqsg

"Fyi we're doing another panel next week about these ""general degrees"" that have unclear career prospects.",btohqsg
And no  they are not teachers.,btohqsg
Omg cool but camera shy :(,btohqsg
or more like cuz singapore is a CoNSerVaTiVe SocIeTy,btohqsg
Every morning is a good morning,btohqsg
i woke up feeling like i absolutely need to shit but im sitting at thhe toilet bowl rn uncapable of shitting,btohqsg
"but even in more ""liberal"" countries like the US ppl also say how gender studies isn't useful ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ",btohqsg
Did anyone get their appeal result alr ? For NTU,btohqsg
Do u know if appealing works?,btohqsg
When i was in NTU  haha i havent heard of any success cases for appeals,btohqsg
Do u mean appealing to review grades?,btohqsg
Or appealing to get into NTU?,btohqsg
Maybe i got the context wrong üòÖ,btohqsg
Oh oh ok. So sorry abt that.,btohqsg
I heard ur grade can drop when u appeal üòÇ,btohqsg
i mean if ppl are gnna go for smth useful i might as well grind for law üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
I wouldnt be asking if i did would i ?,btohqsg
Is like a person jump down the building and u go to him and ask him if he okay,btohqsg
now im worried if ur on ur pms,btohqsg
üòÜ ive heard of that too. But usually the grade will stay the same and u waste money just to appeal,btohqsg
So imo unless u damn sure its marking prob. Like u thought u confirm get at least B but u got like D or F,btohqsg
U dont even get to see ur script,btohqsg
If want to appeal cos u got B+ and thought u would have gotten A dont bother lol,btohqsg
That one most likely is bell curve,btohqsg
Bell curve is a bitch üòí,btohqsg
True. I feel my course too many smart ppl liao üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ,btohqsg
i think lit and linguistic studies still shows your critical thinking skills,btohqsg
i dunno what gender studies shows,btohqsg
"it just makes you angry at everything men do cuz ""muh patriachy"" and see oppression and racial and gender discrimination everything",btohqsg
Linguistics studies i heard u have to follow a tribe,btohqsg
makes someone hateful and keep complaining,btohqsg
but gender studies just nitpick statistics and data to push an agenda,btohqsg
You can always study gender in a non SJW way,btohqsg
theres not much u can do with lit,btohqsg
its like asking me to convert to engineering :‚Äù(,btohqsg
A degree is more than the knowledge,btohqsg
deadass thought she stood a chance,btohqsg
Mine is eng aspect of biophysics,btohqsg
But the one u appealing not cbc meh,btohqsg
I dont mean ur eng one,btohqsg

Time to switch courses (im becoming like jay tan),btohqsg

Divide both sides by c to obtain e = s,btohqsg
cs and ce are type float int,btohqsg
U r thinking in the short term,btohqsg
I think in terms of marginalist principle,btohqsg
U want to go u pm him,btohqsg
Do people actually pm him ?,btohqsg
Id imagine he would use sort algo to send invitations,btohqsg
He will use a priority queue,btohqsg
Thats how girls join his party,btohqsg
If u are guy and not his student almost 0% chance of going,btohqsg
I really dont und how girls go then,btohqsg
Girls no need to be his student,btohqsg
Cause he lacking girls in his party,btohqsg
Then it isnt a good match making service isnt it,btohqsg
U r pretty much creating a gladiator arena,btohqsg
Thats why he is opening up to girls who are not his students,btohqsg
Id be surpsied if non cs fac girls go,btohqsg
lol prof ben really put himself out in the open sia,btohqsg
