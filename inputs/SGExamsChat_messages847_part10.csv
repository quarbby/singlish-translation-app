But you dont need a feedback to know youre the number 1 TA in my heart,btohqsg
He alr submit the grade long ago liao,btohqsg
I put 5 out of 5 stars,btohqsg
He's so good he doesn't need a scale,btohqsg
I need fgo to come NOW,btohqsg
I need to remove my su,btohqsg
Is abt me removing my su so that i can su later,btohqsg
second this  ur lungs are gonna suffer in the long run,btohqsg
what was the subject combo again,btohqsg
I'm planning to take PFME or XFME actually,btohqsg
I would have done something like PCMH but that's a bad idea LOL,btohqsg
I did study the syllabi beforehand  is that commonly expected,btohqsg
My friend said bio + hist + geo + something was suicide,btohqsg
So far people have told me geog is the hardcore one,btohqsg
yeah  it's a lot of content,btohqsg
history can be a lot of memorization but you gotta study history as a story/narrative and not just facts on a page,btohqsg
Ever since I began studying in December I found it really enjoyable,btohqsg
JC econs is nothing like econs in uni or irl,btohqsg
I'm ... using a uni textbook to study econs,btohqsg
it's quite essay based but then as soon as you hit uni it's like week 1: calculus,btohqsg
But would say it may interest those who wanna look into business and governance related topics,btohqsg
no such thing as a demand curve  demand is the partial derivative of a utility function,btohqsg
If I can I might decide to triple major,btohqsg
Quite impossible to triple major in sg tho...,btohqsg
a bit like a second major,btohqsg
I'm planning to enter MIT / Stanford,btohqsg
Math + CS + maybe Econs,btohqsg
planning is a strong word here but all the best,btohqsg
triple major is far too broad  it's usually better to pick one or two things and specialize in it,btohqsg
thing isi already studied uni content for math and cs,btohqsg
We actually have a professor who did a triple major in math wcons and phy,btohqsg
you can be multidisciplinary/interdisciplinary  but it's usually because what you're studying can't be categorized into one or two disciplines,btohqsg
i'd be relearning my math and cs,btohqsg
so i'm seeking new things to learn,btohqsg
i'm just saying what my prof took,btohqsg
Yeah but econs is more applicable i wld say,btohqsg
this will trigger most physicists butphysics is applied math,btohqsg
i mean it worked for him based on his research,btohqsg
i'm not triggered at all lol,btohqsg
if you cannot do math you shouldn't be in physics,btohqsg
any physicist will agree with you,btohqsg
It depends on the type of physicists,btohqsg
it's like if you can't do calculus you shouldn't be in econs,btohqsg
my friend does HEP physicsand yes he's a theoretical phy,btohqsg
LmaoHe still uses a lot of math,btohqsg
my friend is at cern too lol,btohqsg
He hates hearing me tell him that all the time,btohqsg
mb he thinks physics is too applied and like  beneath math,btohqsg
i mean you don't have to tell him that all the time,btohqsg
it was printed in one of my jc math notes,btohqsg
