About 488 for 3 days from SG Car Choice,btohqsg
1/2 if my instalment alrdy haha,btohqsg
What modelDon't think a petrol model cost so much,btohqsg
Car lite has always been the main goal,btohqsg
"500 for 3 days should be ok.Rental outside for ""premium"" cars are around 300 per day",btohqsg
Living with electrification is increasingly easyAlthough electric vehicles are the future  is incorporating one into our daily lives as difficult as we imagine it to be? 🤔💭Read on to find out more➡️https://bit.ly/3CIhhWl,btohqsg
Just nice as we are talking about EVs 😂,btohqsg
But for EV  my concern is still on the availability of the charging port,btohqsg
Is ioniq5 any better for its price,btohqsg
does tesla 3 now requre cat a coe>,btohqsg
I feel ioniq 5 is one of the best EVs available out there as it has the perfect blend of luxury and versatility with sufficient range,btohqsg
Cat B becoz the Kw is 237KW.,btohqsg
basic single motor tesla 3 is 110 kwh,btohqsg
i think tesla 3 is best,btohqsg
Not correct. The single motor is SR+.239kW. The 50kwH is your battery size.,btohqsg
The 239kW is referring to power output. That’s how it is used to determine your cat.,btohqsg
what is the power output of the most basic one,btohqsg
239kW. The performance is 377 kW with dual motor. Both are Cat B.,btohqsg
then the cat A 110 kwh is small is to help the nissan leaf type of cars,btohqsg
if not for coe so high  tesla 3 is really the best,btohqsg
Yes. Only 5 qualify for Cat AIoniq sedan (not the Ioniq 5)Kona Short rangeMG ZSNissan LeafKia Niro Short Range,btohqsg
All the power are below 110 Kw as their battery size is Less than 50kwH,btohqsg
Renault Zoe not sure. Don’t think it’s available.,btohqsg
I rmb seeing an article on 5 EVs that qualify for cat A recently  maybe sgcarmart site,btohqsg
Those 5 yes. Listed above.Ioniq sedan (not the Ioniq 5)Kona Short rangeMG ZSNissan LeafKia Niro Short Range,btohqsg
Even the entry level EQA from Mercedes’   very slow alr also 170 kW,btohqsg
Unfortunately at least 80% of EVs are still in Cat B,btohqsg
Will Cat B COE drop anytime soon?,btohqsg
Realised it’s not the first time it went up close to 100k,btohqsg
Been observing  unlikely so  if there’s a fast transition to EVs  orders for them will go up. Less scrapping of old CoEs.,btohqsg
Problem is will cat a go up further if people decide to switch to cat a evs?,btohqsg
2013 was the period when there’s a lot of Uber/Grab fleet cars. Some Cat A and B. But by 2023 those cars have to scrap as they are not allowed to be used for PHV as the lifespan for PHVs must be max 7 years.,btohqsg
So 2023 will be bad cos phv will need to renew coes?,btohqsg
Good point also. Again  if less scrapping  likely it’ll stay at that range or slighly higher. I not sure if there will be an immediate jump in demand for those EVs as honestly the range is still nothing to be impressed about.,btohqsg
Doubt private hire cars will actually be EVs😂,btohqsg
Could be too. Depending on the fleet size but honestly there are new cars registered for PHVs in the past 1-2 years alr  so it shouldn’t suddenly increase the PHV population too much at least in my opinion.,btohqsg
Can you imagine charging more than once a day,btohqsg
Their average range is 300+ per day. So in fact It’s every day.,btohqsg
N Charging take more than 40 mins even for DC charging?,btohqsg
And if no DC access = have to wait for 7-8 hours for 0-100,btohqsg
For low distance users it is okay,btohqsg
Depending on the battery tech and the DC charge rate,btohqsg
Maybe 15 mins DC charging and more availablity of charging pts,btohqsg
But ev road tax oso more ex,btohqsg
Yeah I did some quick calcs also.Assume:Daily minimum commute is 60km just from work to home. Some days I may clock 100 depending on the schedule but let’s average 80km per day.Weekly is about 560km.If I use an EV with 300km range I’ll have to charge every 4 days. About 25 per charge  so it’s about 100bucks per month. Or slighly more.,btohqsg
Ya so use 25 per charge and frequency of charging as your reference point against petrol cost. So you can then make a decision whether EV running cost vs petrol running cost is more. Personally I feel as of now  EV still is more expensive for long commuting.,btohqsg
But if Ev become common and mass usage,btohqsg
The cost of charging may oso go up in future,btohqsg
Indeed  so it could be more than 100 per month in the future.As of now  some cars can let you charge for free with the right facilities like Shell Recharge for 3 years if you buy a BMW EV  or Tesla superchargers if you get a Tesla.Just limited by locations and all. So I feel spending time to analyse which is best for you is prudent.,btohqsg
The SP survey placed by SGCM admins here also asked about how much premium will you pay to charge at:1. Town areas2. Peak hours3. Popular places.It gives an idea for us as consumers how much we are willing to pay as a whole to have that convenience and in terms help in their planning for charger deployment,btohqsg
