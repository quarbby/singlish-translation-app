your instincts are now very questionable  but im intrigued,btohqsg
I do realise their promoters are all young people,btohqsg
Never seen an old auntie or uncle working for them,btohqsg
Usually promoters i see are auntie uncles and not much young people,btohqsg
There is actually 1 star review and 2 star but many years back,btohqsg
Yea. Maybe their service standards did improve thereafter.,btohqsg
Cannot be 1 entire year no 1 star review,btohqsg
Just like the motto for their church its all made for youths,btohqsg
I wonder what happens when they all get old lol,btohqsg
Yea man. Even Apple Store who pride in customer service also not 5 stars.,btohqsg
Anyone that associates with the church scares me,btohqsg
Well. I ‘m still friends with some of them. More like who you meet.,btohqsg
Is it cos they will sing song in aeroplane?,btohqsg
Good ah  idk how to be friends with them if i keep rejecting them,btohqsg

My sec school friends ask me go,btohqsg
Maybe the promoters grp behave diff.,btohqsg
Idk how to answer that friend,btohqsg

Revealing phone number back then was like normal,btohqsg
