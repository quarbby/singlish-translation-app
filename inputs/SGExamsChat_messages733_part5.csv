But removing it will do more harm than good,btohqsg
Dawg not to shit on yi but do uk their 90rp rate is sibei low,btohqsg
I think the requirement should be lowered to raw 17 at the very least,btohqsg
yijc merging with mi would be interesting though,btohqsg
I think the requirement is in net,btohqsg
Yea so why would mi merge with yi,btohqsg
i think a 3 year course in yijc would appeal more ppl to enter yijc instead of gg poly,btohqsg
I mean to reduce the no of JCs if merge,btohqsg
Na I suspect its just the rigidity of it,btohqsg
If not make YI 3 years so another institute is available,btohqsg
I studied using YIs notes before as well,btohqsg
They keep yapping on about structure,btohqsg
Not everyone can afford to travel to Bukit Batok lmao,btohqsg
the east should have 1-2 more jcs tho,btohqsg
Which I mean ig from stem it working but humanities u don't just do that.,btohqsg
merging into 1 east jc is kinda stupid tho,btohqsg
Eh hm in a sense yea but either way it'll benefit them wat so what talking u,btohqsg
dhs also if you wanna count it,btohqsg
Now east is just TJC VJC and TM,btohqsg
Nyjc is pretty near the east,btohqsg
but the west is stacked of jcs,btohqsg
DHS is almost east but I would say more south,btohqsg
Dhs is the closest to the city,btohqsg
Like with new TEL it’s literally 2-3 stops from Marina Bay Area,btohqsg
do you think every jc should either have an mrt line to itself or have an exit just outside the jc?,btohqsg
The location is so prime I’m surprised the govt hasn’t acquired it back and shifted dhs somewhere else,btohqsg
Wait why talking about np now,btohqsg
Just as long as have decent transport links is fine liao,btohqsg
some jcs are rlly inaccessible in terms of public transportation tho,btohqsg
Then ya la if its that bad then yes but as long as its not over stretched it's fine imo,btohqsg
I just think our conception is too narrow,btohqsg
then wtv Ur trying to say and reinforce is useless,btohqsg
Bro u cant just overgeneralise like that,btohqsg
Why tf would u even do that,btohqsg
Bro just run it under cool water for 5-10 mins and in that time u contemplate on your dumb decisions that led you to get burned.,btohqsg
I mean scraping it or not just going it is all that matters cuz unis provide more academic freedom,btohqsg
Come I go your room blow the wound for you,btohqsg
If u party often you can use vodka to sanitise the wound or hand sanitiser,btohqsg
I am surprised u don't even have like a small supply,btohqsg
"I mean as an option  yes  but I wouldnt recommend it as a ""compulsory"" thing",btohqsg
But anyways  I have seen people who were pretty much forced to go jc instead of poly come to this school. So I can tell why some of them would feel that way.,btohqsg
But then on the other hand  I do see some of them being hardworking uh  just that kena pulled down by PW.,btohqsg
YIJC and MI no similarity at all,btohqsg
Ok then it should be just merge yi with another JC  or make yi a 3 year a level sch. Merging yi either mi would just be to combine the sch’s resources so that yi won’t be completely dissolved and MI would have more resources. But then again if the 3 year a level route should be made slightly more common  merging would not be the best idea. I think it would be better to just make yi a 3 yr course sch.,btohqsg
why are you guys still debating about a 20 cop jc and an institute that uses the r4 system LOL,btohqsg
they should just be gone at this rate  like what@ticktockisaclocksaid,btohqsg
I feel like throwing up every other day,btohqsg
U are hving nausea like almost every day,btohqsg
I think u should visit a doctor,btohqsg
How do u get use to vomiting,btohqsg
