The 1.6% Cashback top up to grab is gonna end in a few more daysI think it is still eligible for 1.6% if u top up grab before the deadline.You can then keep the money and pay your insurance when it comes.Otherwise there’s not much u can do unless your insurance takes amex,btohqsg
Oh. So once Grab is over  the card will deemed useless,btohqsg
Not really useless bah  can be your backup card when u have max out the rest of your cards benefits,btohqsg
Any other cards recommended for insurance,btohqsg
Not from me  others here might have,btohqsg
This also got cash back? Visa quite stingy de,btohqsg
Hi everyone  is the SIF good for FD?,btohqsg

Finally after 5 called over 2 weeks,btohqsg
Guys how long does hsbc credit card approval takes? I applied but still no news yet,btohqsg

HSBC had been giving luggage bags for most of 2022,btohqsg
Is it a good idea to get from them this month?,btohqsg
Check singsaver HSBC promo  got lucky draw  free chair  earpiece or 300 cash back,btohqsg
I applied for SCB in Nov22 for the chair. Probably getting the $300 cash,btohqsg
For hsbc go download their app.. maybe they would have approved your ecard,btohqsg
When I called and they told me I have been approved there was no email telling me that I was approved,btohqsg
Singsaver seems to be slow in verifying the spending from the bank,btohqsg
If you see your card no. On the app. Just activate and you can start using,btohqsg

hi Gurus  how does the GXS  bonus of 4 times $2.5 works? i received the invite  but i cant find much info from their website. not sure if it is worth to open an account with GXS,btohqsg
opening is easy as clicking a button  if u have 5k around  the flexi interest is not bad?no idea about the bonus tho,btohqsg
i dun have spare 5k  trying to hit the 100k mark for uob one account. maybe few months down the road  i may have spare 5k. haha,btohqsg
so open GXS must 1 shot transfer 5k over?,btohqsg
focus on uob one then  if the interest is higher (if u do all the steps) - 4% > 3.48% is kinda neat,btohqsg
UOB one i lacking ard 5k also to fulfil 100k mark. but this is my first month  waiting to spend $500 and salary credit in. not sure Feb will see some good bonus for cny XD,btohqsg
i see the promotion for GXS bonus didnt seem to have set any deadline yet~ maybe can status quo first.,btohqsg
everytime you earn $ interest of 2.5 from the saving pocket  they match with a $2.5 bonus  until it hit $10 bonus earned,btohqsg
hm. any min amount must transfer to GXS? if i just put 500 will be able to get it?,btohqsg
then no more $2.5 but you still earn your $3.85% interest,btohqsg
min balance of $0.01 to earn interest,btohqsg
i see. so it is go big or go home to earn the $2.5. must credit 5k in 1st transaction,btohqsg
$5k is to earn it fast  too small dk take how long,btohqsg
cause now max is $5k so $0.48 per day,btohqsg
need $21 days with $5k to earn finish the bonus $10,btohqsg
I see. I guess I can try once I have spare 5k to throw in GXS. I will focus on UOB one first.,btohqsg
Has anyone tried this? For Citi rewards cc,btohqsg
HI  anyone used AMEX tcb to buy capitaland vouchers  does it qulaify for the 3% cashback?,btohqsg
I wouldn't cuz im farming miles,btohqsg
Oh curious how much does it worth,btohqsg
I think 2+ % only in cashback. May be wrong,btohqsg
Any idea if I pair Citi rewards with amaze and pay for starhub reccuring and giga telcom bills. Will i get 10x point?,btohqsg
I doubt so. Must pay manually every month,btohqsg
How about giga  how to manual? Got ways?,btohqsg
