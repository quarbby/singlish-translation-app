nah I have little to no chance,btohqsg
i guess it helps for local bond free uni scholarships,btohqsg
but govt scholarships yeah 90 is not a must,btohqsg
This economy  just go bonded la,btohqsg
You bonded to what sucky area,btohqsg
How can Ministry work suck that much,btohqsg
Ok actually I understand some areas really sucky but,btohqsg
ye I heard abt that but MOE is definitely fine,btohqsg
(This statement was made without proof but it's not like I can say otherwise/shrug),btohqsg
Oh ya  MOE should be ok tbh,btohqsg
One dangerous place I know is LTA,btohqsg
LTA scholarship requirements quite high  bond length quite long also  I'd say not worth it unless your life skill amazingly high,btohqsg
isn't the career progression there good,btohqsg
Anecdotal evidence of how they treat scholars has not been good,btohqsg
But I have a senior in LTA  he said he not dying last I saw him so I guess,btohqsg
most NUS students take 1-2 cs mods right,btohqsg
But I have peers who are now in LTA  can ask how he's doing later on,btohqsg
even if they arent in cs,btohqsg
Depends which faculty you are in,btohqsg
If you are in science some majors require you to take CS1010  which is an intro programming course,btohqsg
Enginnering also has madatory programming mods  as well as finance if I remember,btohqsg
You will find out more when you get in,btohqsg
I think by now only FASS don't have intro programming as a core module,btohqsg
Biz included one a few sems back,btohqsg
oh some engine courses also don't need,btohqsg
oh yeah sde also prolly won't touch,btohqsg
my school gave me a metric ton of propaganda/material,btohqsg
LTA is the very reason why I want to get out of the Uni course i currently got accepted into,btohqsg
Booking in is a sad time,btohqsg
I used to want to work with LTA. But recent times really showed me how dense the upper management can be in the way they handle transportation in Singapore. Normal staff are just pawns  scapegoats and puppets for them,btohqsg
Ok we can do something over the weekend,btohqsg
I used to intern for LTA  my impression is that there is a massive disconnect between the LTA on the ground and the upper management,btohqsg
just a reminder that 377a as a law still exists,btohqsg
Sir this is a Methodist institution,btohqsg
my mind says no but john's body says yes,btohqsg
ACJC stands for And Cocks Jocks Cunts,btohqsg
Yes of course. The bosses drive cars and yet try to prance behind the lines and enforce a car-lite society,btohqsg
I have to say though  different organisations in SG seem to suffer different levels of this. I wonder if PUB is also like this,btohqsg
Lol not even cheap cars  I see HQ area Merz so many,btohqsg
thats... pretty gay bro... üò≥ unless...,btohqsg
I think this has to do with like Asian straight male culture because cars are like a sign of success,btohqsg
Meanwhile Minister Chan said he drives a Prius  anyone can confirm,btohqsg
upper management would look damn beta if they took public transport,btohqsg
Yep but LTA is a really bad one though,btohqsg
i saw his trademark prius outside his house,btohqsg
Ya Minister of Transport and SMRT CEO takes MRT on their first day of work to wayang  then they drive their BMW for the subsequent days of their lives,btohqsg
He said on public interview before. Something along driving the prius cuz most efficient,btohqsg
You haven‚Äôt lived until you see Mr Khaw on the train after doing a talk at Ruffles Institution,btohqsg
i am reminded of ruffles potato chips now,btohqsg
They‚Äôve bought too many buses in recent times that they aren‚Äôt even using. They‚Äôre all rotting in the bus depots. They even put those that were in service for a period of time back to storage. They also introduced useless bus services to waste resources :‚Äù),btohqsg
