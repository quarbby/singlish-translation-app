How do you use HSBC giro to pay for Amex bill ? Just enter the card number ?,btohqsg
Is this what you are looking for?https://www.americanexpress.com/content/dam/amex/sg/pdfs/InterbankGIRO_GRCC.pdf,btohqsg
Oh nice one … didn’t know you could do that :p,btohqsg
Use this with HSBC Eva will get 1% rebate right,btohqsg
I didnt do this myself but should be.,btohqsg
Yes you will. I’m on giro with Amex via EGA,btohqsg
Anyone used the hsbc ega to withdraw from overseas atm? What are the rates like? I boycott trust liao so looking for alternatif. Have youtrip and wise but got tiny limits 😕,btohqsg
Why use cash if card is acceptable most places ?,btohqsg
I will use card whenever possible but Some places i need to use cash,btohqsg
Withdrawing Ega should be from ur fcy account right? Then the rate is ur conversion rate.,btohqsg
I was just wondering what the spread is for a non supported currency,btohqsg
Coz trust rates are actually pretty decent but i dont use them anymore,btohqsg
I know citi global is abt 0.6-1% depending on the currency,btohqsg
withdrawing unsupported currency with HSBC EGA will get DCC plus their own spread. I’d suggest you looking at youtrip if you dont want to do biz with trust.,btohqsg
Unfortunately only $400 per mth.😕.I boycott trust ever since i withdrew cash from a rio de janeiro atm   transaction failed but they still deducted money from my savings acct. been a couple of mths  raised a dispute but no refund.,btohqsg
Your standard ATM also can draw cash   as long as the ATM supports plus network . Overall for travel I think best to use wallets like Revolut or youtrip . Save on your FX. Other cash withdrawal options will be expensive,btohqsg

hi for citi rewards cc  do i earn points if i buy phone via atome 3-month instalment?,btohqsg
does the instalment amount also count for the $500 min spend for moneysmart rewards?,btohqsg
Atome can but better trigger manually. Other kind of instalment won't earn points.,btohqsg
thanks for the reply! but what do u mean by trigger manually?,btohqsg
Atome will split the amount into 3 parts. 2nd and 3rd payments can be paid before the due dates. Go to atome app and pay in advance.,btohqsg
Anybody use Trust to atm money in Korea? Any fees incurred?,btohqsg
Only spend criteria for UOB One account interest if it is an eligible card. No cashback/miles/card min spend.,btohqsg
Every transaction will incur transaction fee. But that should not be the reason to stop you from DCA..,btohqsg
So I will set  ‘monthly recurring’ and increase the investment amount. Maybe Lumpsum once a while,btohqsg
Anyone know if hsbc live+ card count the minimum 600 spending by transaction date or post date?,btohqsg
hi all  anyone know of any promo codes (apart from sign-up/new user ones) for cardup/ipaymy that would be applicable to say renovation payments? i've seen those for paying income tax but not for other purposes.cos if not  the normal 2+% service fee makes it less of a value proposition (compared to say if can reduce it to 1.8%-ish) to pay for things like reno. thank you!,btohqsg
Provided you deposit the $500 on the first day of the month and assuming the first day of the month is not Sunday or public holiday. Otherwise  higher amount is required.Your salary must be from corporate account n can fulfil the salary credit criteria.,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to seek your expert opinions. If i have a $12-15k payment  is there a card that can allow installment repayment without interest?Eg: i use a credit card to pay 12k and breakdown into 6x 2k installments.Appreciate your advice thanks!,btohqsg
Barely 4% after the new account opening promo ends,btohqsg
Call them  just go straight to the emergency line. It took me few days to setup online banking with them. They have really horrible systems  not limited to: Online banking setup  Gpay integration and Hotline menu.,btohqsg
OCBC NXT can do installments automatically (divide by 3 or 6),btohqsg
hi yes i have 🙂 for now i'll use the new user sign-up code then evaluate whether worth it to pay income tax/reno bills using my uob prvi miles card,btohqsg
Anybody has issue with zym calling out and receiving calls?,btohqsg
