🚀Pika World Update- 15 October 2021🚀🧨Taper is expected to be faster🧨As we recap for the week  the stock market retraced sharply on Monday and Tuesday. However  Wednesday saw a firmer need despite the FOMC minutes indicating a possible faster rate of tapering.While tapering is expected to occur  the consensus was for a start in December and probably finished by mid-2022. Nonetheless  the FOMC minutes had suggested a faster timeline. It means possible tapering by mid-November. Yet  the market seems to hold well.Indeed  the faster pace does not shape the general picture since the Fed is already determined to do so. Pika World continues to favour some financials to better hedge on a higher interest rate environment.🎉Bank of America: Pika World's Favourite🎉Readers of Pika World would have known the counter since we had been trading it for a long time  especially during the year's first half. The latest earnings results were robust as the bank released some of its reserves and charged more advisory fees.Profits hit $7.7 billion while ahead of the forecast of $6.1 billion. There is improvement in organic growth  and net interest margin had increased by $1 billion given strong deposit growth and investing in the excess liquidity held by the bank.Notably  Pika World likes the strong advisory and wealth management business which hit near-record levels. In addition  its global wealth business brought in a healthy sum of $1.2 billion. Therefore  we continue to favour its business outlook  notwithstanding changes in the macro-environment.🎙TSMC: Tight Supplies Remains🎙Even as the company registered a 14% jump in net profit  it expects a tight capacity situation in 2022 as worldwide shortages of semiconductors see little relief.Indeed  chips shortages have stiffened economic recovery and impacted global consumer brands such as Apple  where its chips are used in 5G-enabled smartphones. Apple contributes about one-fourth of TSMC's revenue  and its ability to ramp up production will be in focus.📮What's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm.
