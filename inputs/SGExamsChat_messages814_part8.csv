cause alot of govt projects spanning years or even decades..and knowing how the people who start may not always end..they always have the wlb approach,btohqsg
Oh yeah our class like throwing stuff they throw a table into the teacher before,btohqsg
yea  one of my friend's friend from a few yrs ago said she intern pub for 1 yr...literally the majority of her time was going to the cafe to drink kopi,btohqsg
does anyone want my referral code,btohqsg
Got so bad they disbanded our class,btohqsg
i still remembered scene in pri 3...the teacher angry with this prefect and bang the table and took away his badge,btohqsg
P5 and P5 they split the entire class into 6 units,btohqsg
thats normal  out of the 4 teachers i saw cry  one was a dc teacher,btohqsg
i know people throw temper tantrums during primary school but your case is probably the worst,btohqsg
2 in pri  2 in sec. for dc teacher it was sec 2,btohqsg
or idk what r they even called for your class,btohqsg
Hey our class was calledinnovationfor a reason,btohqsg
cried infront of the whole class during a bag check with the other dc teachers standing by,btohqsg
innovate to make teachers leave when u dun want them,btohqsg
why is there a bag check,btohqsg
Is not even dun wan em,btohqsg
Either way I'm not really interested in the public sectors now so...,btohqsg
they got intel some of my classmates got illegal things in their bag,btohqsg
Legit half of em couldn't even speak in the class,btohqsg
not really disband the class but more of split the students into different classesi thought you meant the Innovation class got scrapped or something,btohqsg
It was so loud we drown out the noise of the cher,btohqsg
after the bag check  the dc teacher in charge  (not dc master) cried infront of the whole class and came out with some poetic statements,btohqsg
So it was just a incessant mishmash of noise drowned out and end up no lesson rlly occurs,btohqsg
"like one of those talks where the presumed idea was to ""Set the mind"" straight kind of talks",btohqsg
Like in front of the school cohort,btohqsg
wait there is this in primary school?,btohqsg
bruh they guess all wrong siala,btohqsg
Above P4 and with parents approval,btohqsg
speaking of which i know someone who got caught vaping but only 2w suspension,btohqsg
Back then vaping didn't rlly exist,btohqsg
didn‚Äôt piss off any teachers so I guess he‚Äôs fine,btohqsg
I assume is the thought process,btohqsg
I know of someone in uni who tried to sell vape,btohqsg
But tbh vaping that one quite minor,btohqsg
sometimes 'parents approval' is a for show on paper,btohqsg
Like everyday classmates wld mention ppl vaping but still no suspension lpl,btohqsg
If they caught every1 that vaped at least a whole class in my level is outüíÄ,btohqsg
u need to do sth stupid to be caught,btohqsg
like vaping in the toilet  vaping before sch etc,btohqsg
In Secondary got ppl piak piak also never got caught,btohqsg
The ones who do legit go out of their way,btohqsg
coz i think the fruity smell is quite obvios,btohqsg
"Our toilets always got ""air fresheners""",btohqsg
it's the very obvious fake or pungent smell like someone sprayed too much perfume or cologne,btohqsg
Had a few vapers say. After they do vape they tried smoking and the nicotine load was fucking non-existent,btohqsg
wasn't it said that vape has more chemicals ( i forgot if it's nicotine specifically or what ) inside them,btohqsg
that's why ppl who smoke say vape > cigarettes maybe,btohqsg
The main reason for the ban was cuz it was too varied or some shit but retarded la imo cuz by banning means u dun rlly regulate it,btohqsg
U cannot set limits on the nicotine load if u outright make it illegal,btohqsg
my sec sch class always had ‚Äúair freshener‚Äù during recess time,btohqsg
