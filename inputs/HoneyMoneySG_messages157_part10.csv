Anyone using UOB Visa Signature Card? Would like to know how is it,btohqsg
good if you have monthly spend above $1k,btohqsg
best way is u tabulate your daily balance in a spreadsheet and ensure the average daily balance for Mar is 500 more than that in Feb.,btohqsg
when is the snapshot for daily balance done?,btohqsg
Thinking should I cancel my uob ladies and get this instead lol.,btohqsg
Hi  would it be recommended to sign up for IBKR if Iâ€™m already a WeBull user? I donâ€™t active trade as Iâ€™m a newbie  so mainly holding long term investments for now.,btohqsg
around 9.30pm. Can see which date ur transactions fall under.,btohqsg
lets say the cutoff for a particular day is 8pm  if i withdraw at 7pm or 9pm its a huge difference,btohqsg
the salary can immediately withdraw after it goes in?,btohqsg
hi are there any uob ppv sign up promos? also  with CF banning AXS  does it mean i cant use it to pay for insurance and earn miles?,btohqsg
Wanted my card list to be like this- Citi rewards = online- UOB Visa = offline paymentBut I will have one missing  I can use uob ladies and put catagory for travel but I don't travel so much also.Will it be hard to waiver for uob?,btohqsg
Yes or you can withdraw next day,btohqsg
for brand new account  what should i first put in? 98.2k? then salary comes in  i take out everything excess of 100k? my salary in on 23rd,btohqsg
uob only have sure get sign up bonus for uob prvi pay annual fee option,btohqsg
from the spreadsheet u mean i should put 95.5k now? after salary credit  remove all and leave 96k?,btohqsg
put 100k to max out interest,btohqsg
brand new acc  how much to put in now? my salary come in alr i just leave enough for +500?,btohqsg
hi gurus  now that the citi rewards + amaze strategy has been nerfed  what are your new strategies or cards for general spending?,btohqsg
I don't get what you mean by salary come in already leave enough for +500..,btohqsg
If you have 100k now  the easiest is just deposit 100k  and when salary credit just transfer out your salary? I'm assuming you are depositing 100k on the day of opening.,btohqsg
100ksalary comes in then becomes say 110k.then i withdraw 9500 become 10500,btohqsg
What is your purpose? Your MAB in Feb is $0.,btohqsg
need increase saving by 500 right?,btohqsg
for next month i should do that?,btohqsg
1st month confirmed higher than last month monthly average balance of $0,btohqsg
Next month you deposit $500 on the first day and withdraw your salary the exact same day it's credited. If it comes in at 8am  do it at 8:01am  if it comes in at 8pm  do it at 8:01pm.,btohqsg
deposit 500 more than last month MAB on the 1st of month if it is mon to sat and not public holiday. If sunday or public holiday need to recalculate how much to deposit on  the following weekday.,btohqsg
Will I be charged FCY fee if i cancel the transaction but the refund only come in 2 weeks?,btohqsg
does ocbc tell u ur last month mab? or need track yoself,btohqsg
depends if transaction is void or refunded,btohqsg
Example if I just only spend 4k a year for uob ladies. Then probably 10k for uob Visa. Do I even get waive for the uob ladies?,btohqsg
should be ok  worst case cancel card and uni$ will retain if u have other uni$ earning card,btohqsg
Just worry my spending is not enough for waive,btohqsg
just cancel card is they dun waive annual fees. Nothing much to worry about,btohqsg
Alright man. I just gotten my uob ladies. Let me think abt it. Thanks for the advises,btohqsg

I got a question..does coffeeshop accept google pay to scan on qr code?and can i link google pay to chocolate finance card?,btohqsg
Use excel and cross check with the website average balance (app don't show this info) to validate your formula. I usually do a final validation near month end so there's enough time to make adjustments.,btohqsg
You can also see from the statement but might be a bit late so best is probably to still use excel,btohqsg
Make multiple payment of 250. Be it 10k  20k or 100k ðŸ˜œ.,btohqsg
