depends what u spend on. If can get more rebate by spending $600 on Evol and the rest on other cards  then why not. Think it make sense to spend so much on uob one only if u have a lot of utilities bill to pay and spend lots on shopee or dairy farm group or Grab.,btohqsg
how do i see how much cashback i got from my one card? can‚Äôt find anything on my statements last month. can‚Äôt be don‚Äôt have cashback at all :/,btohqsg
only can see bonus cashback at end of 4th statement month. Quarterly rebate to be credited only if u have bill to offset at end of 4th or later statement month.,btohqsg
ok i saw this in my ONE card statement in April:- cash rebate bill redemption $100- enhance rebate $33.99- additional rebate $26.47,btohqsg
does it make sense to stay with it or change to evol?,btohqsg
Evol Cashback is how many percent,btohqsg
effective 6.67% if spend $250 on online  $250 on mobile contactless  $100 anything so long not excluded,btohqsg
Evol will only cover $600 spending. See if u can use other cards (e.g. maybank family and friends  citi cashback) for the rest of the spending  meet the min spend and get good rebate.,btohqsg
so that‚Äôs $40 max per month. still higher than my current rebate from ONE assuming that amount in my statement is for 4 months?,btohqsg
that amount is for 3 months,btohqsg
i see. so using evol alone might not be beneficial for me. i‚Äôll need evol + some other cards to give a better rebate than ONE in my situation,btohqsg
Can use evol to topup ezlink card?,btohqsg
no. topup excluded. Can use for simplygo,btohqsg
Then what is the stored value topup for? Saw in the pdf file,btohqsg
I find uob one to be more simple. Just spent 500 and done with it. Get extra if in special category like grab/dailyFarmGrp/SimplyGo/utility. As for evol. Better rebate but more effort to track spending on mobile contactless and online. However  I think if u can meet min 600  the rebate shld be better (based on just max out one cat of online spent already hit 250 x 0.08 =20 per mth. 60 per qtr),btohqsg
I am lazy. So my card strategy is uob one + hsbc revo.,btohqsg
oh i use dbs to uob. uob to uob wont be fast mah  will be normal transfer i guess,btohqsg
Both card similar effort to track bah,btohqsg
did u open EGA as well?,btohqsg
and how do you all track ur card expenses to ensure u don‚Äôt cross 500/600? i find it pretty tough üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
ah i see. i just put my excess in t-bills and funds so think i‚Äôll review later this year haha,btohqsg
So the pdf info is wrong,btohqsg
Good to split some fund in saving acct for emergency use and some in mid term like t-bill/sgs/Ssb,btohqsg
no ah it is showing the excluded MCCs. Stored value topup is under one of these excluded MCCs.,btohqsg
the one in my uob one is for emergency lor haha. the rest in t-bills/funds/stocks so haven‚Äôt found a reason for EGA yet,btohqsg
Oh ok. Read wrongly. Then not much for eligible spend for $500,btohqsg
Thanks  yup I just called and the CSO said the application is completed  nothing pending on my side. So just awaiting their SMS confirmation!,btohqsg

Not sure why that's not an instant ban.,btohqsg
"Just got off a telephone conversation with a HSBC staff member. On the website  it says ""Start a new relationship with HSBC Premier and get rewards up to SGD10 437. Plus a 1-night stay at Shangri-La Singapore  Tower Wing Deluxe Room includes breakfast & Internet access for 2 adults (worth SGD 420++ )"" and this separate from Welcome gifts section that requries ""Total Relationship Balance of fresh funds SGD200 000 in fresh funds and purchase a minimum of SGD25 000"". She has to go and check on the website herself to find out about this promotion and then told me it's a 'package'. No investments  no rewards. Very misleading.. Not sure whether I should go Premier and rather put the cash somewhere else. HSBC staff is really poor",btohqsg
Looks decent but I can't find it in the website. Any links,btohqsg
Hi May I ask which credit card is suitable to pay Iras tax and can get cash back or Sing saver rewards?,btohqsg
Use Cardup x OCBC Voyage ?,btohqsg
Anyone port number to maxx ? Do I need to sign up for a line and thereafter port my number ?,btohqsg
If you are interested go and find out yourself la. They have already shared with you briefly. You expect them to know the details by heart meh?,btohqsg
RHB Singapore has one of the highest SGD FD rates.,btohqsg
Can use this website to check which bank offers the highest FD.,btohqsg
I wanted to but it was sold out within an hour of launch,btohqsg
Hope I'm not being Karen about it but it's not an unsoliticited call. They call me back to specifically talk about opening the particular account  yet they don't know their promotion..,btohqsg
Actually I think the Hsbc staff should have been better trained. If their main purpose was to dangle the carrot in front for u to signup for a service  they should at least know the full details of the carrot well enough to answer specific questions.,btohqsg
What is the K stand for?,btohqsg
Oh I thought it was like a cold call  or a cross selling. If it is a callback  then they ought to better represent their HSBC Premier product. It speaks volumes of the level of service they are prepared for their Premier level clients.,btohqsg
sorry my bad spelling error BRICS,btohqsg
For yall to use please tell me if can/cannot,btohqsg
For most categories like Dining  transport  SimplyGo and utilities; why a lot of sifus here recommend HSBC Revolution over OCBC 365? 365 has 6% and 3% cash rebates on those MCC whereas HSBC just gives 4mpd/2.5% and if you have EGA + 1% more.,btohqsg
Literally not an expert  but I would rather sell a kidney than deal with HSBC Singapore‚Äôs notorious custommer service and non existent branch network,btohqsg
If I have a Citibank joint account  am I considered existing bank member or I will be considered new to bank when I open a new bank account?,btohqsg
Not sure where u reading. hsbc revolution only give 0.4mpd for simplygo  0mpd for utilities.ocbc 365 being nerfed soon.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  for UOB Evol Card  if I use ApplePay to purchase items in an online app (some apps feature ApplePay as payment method)  does that fall under the ‚Äúonline‚Äù or ‚Äúmobile contactless‚Äù category? Many thanks.,btohqsg
use UOB one card for these,btohqsg
