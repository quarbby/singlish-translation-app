Anyone here knows what's the B3 range for Biology (estimate),btohqsg
Then what’s the difference with emath gosh,btohqsg
As part of MOE’s year-long engagement series  “A World Beyond School”  MOE Communications and Engagement Group has held two Facebook live sessions titled “Insights into the World Beyond School”. These live sessions are interactive and conversational  and focuses on how the future of work could look like  and how MOE can support youth to develop values  attitudes  mindsets and competencies (i.e. 21st Century Competencies) to thrive in the changing work landscape.During these sessions  MOE invites panellists such as industry professionals  parents and youths to share their experiences and discuss how the future of work could look like and how skills and dispositions required of students could be developed. Viewers may pose live questions via comments.In the upcoming session  on 7 November 2023 (Tuesday) from 8pm to 9pm the panel will be sharing how strengths and interests might shape our career choices  the transferable skills employers look for and what resilience might look like at work.,btohqsg
"The panel will consist of:- Trisha Suresh  Head of Public Policy and Economic Graph  LinkedIn SEA and Steering Committee at Mentoring SG- Derrick Lee  Co-Founder and CTO of Accredify- Serene Sim  Youth Wellness Coach  Joules Affinity and PSG LeaderShould you have any questions for the panellists  share them on the events page and click on the ""Interested"" button to get updates of the event!https://go.gov.sg/awbs-nov5",btohqsg
long ended when he talked abt CS with wrong info to a person in CS i just wanted the neko laoda to finish it off,btohqsg
im not even supposed to be part of Ambulance crew,btohqsg
Im very well aware of this part... but like i mentioned world creation..you are basically creating a world where your own physical self can't live in.As you said  you can use it to detect/categorise/predict etc...but its all based on patterns and algorithms...For a topic i literally have no interest in...I actually somehow have done the most notes when i learn about computers,btohqsg
understanable...I dont claim i know  its a simple statement whether factual or not,btohqsg
so if thats the case where its a topic you have no interest in then wouldnt that suggest you shouldnt be categorising everything to just VR and world creation  cancer detection  categorisation and prediction do not always narrow down into the VR / world creation. ML/AI works in this current day and age   without VR  its used to aid people to do tasks more efficiently  not to create a new world.,btohqsg
my general understanding is simple  why would you want to aid in doing task more efficiently if you were already happy with how the current world is.It only means you are not happy with the current world,btohqsg
im intrested to know how you have not realise this is what my mindset is,btohqsg
"still doesnt explain your generic statement that cs is all about VR/AR before i asked you ""are you sure""",btohqsg
they dont and im fully well aware..but like i mentioned before my parents literally have the same thinking as me,btohqsg
considering how you have this mindset  explains how you manage to find ways to get people to be pissed off about the way you converse,btohqsg
im just being realistic..i dont have to be a people pleaser.,btohqsg
its not the fact of being a people pleaser lol,btohqsg
You know very well yourself..progress have limitations and with the way this new wave of new technology that its starting to do more harm than good.,btohqsg
dont worry  we will see who gets to see the year 2100 first,btohqsg
"you give statements like""i mean yea...i think its to do with ar/vr tho""""Yea but it’s all in the virtual reality and world creation front""and expect people to take it at face value when CS is more than what you stated. you base it off what you learn instead of condering what all CS students learn  and before stating youre not a CS student  its pretty obvious what we are learning is not all surrounding AR/VR  CS consists of web development  app development  algorithm making  game making  AI that consists of ML  DL etc  and your ""well known"" VR. if you stated that its a sub-section of what CS entails  fine  you wont have 2 CS degree students coming ""up your ass""  well not really coming ""up your ass"" because if we really was that willing to  we would go more indepth",btohqsg
If i wanted people to take it and actually believed what i said..i would go to tiktok  i would go to twitter..I wont be saying all these here,btohqsg
being dead inside is no different,btohqsg
so you expect us to let you go with that narrative and show all the other people viewing that message who may be looking at this chat for people who are in the field to give insights to what their possible options would be,btohqsg
did you not see the reaction  someone was questioning it...,btohqsg
im done talking i have my ans,btohqsg
nah the shame will not fall on me...i wont ever have any say in the world...if anything you will,btohqsg
i’m literally in a research seminar rn,btohqsg
to someone who generalises everything CS to VR and world creation,btohqsg
to a 2 CS students  me and the neko laoda,btohqsg
omg u study comp sci ah,btohqsg
Yall are students for a reason..Im a student for a reason. But at the end of the day  learning never stops. You never heard of that?,btohqsg
apologies to everyone else for my swearing,btohqsg
like it or not  i will learn something...as what kuro said about progress,btohqsg
look around you  there is already resistance in the learning of augmented reality and applications...already resistance in the use of pervasive and immersive technology to aid in everyday life,btohqsg
the maturity yall have astounds me,btohqsg
the fact we give you examples to how CS is NOT only about VR and you continuing to twist it into a god damn society where everything has to be all about world changing and VR is suggesting youre not learning  you have a god damn skewed view of society based on what youre learning great. do i hate VR absolutely not  i think thats a world of its own but in no way everything a subset of VR and world creation. if thats true  then we shouldnt call it computer science  we should call it the world of VR. VR is a specific subset to the whole of CS. so is AI  so is web development. things work in harmony is the statement  not everything surrounds VR and world creation.youre learning? i think talking to a wall is less infuriating than you because at least they absorb the words and dont go twisting it into the same narrativematurity? then fine  take a CS course.,btohqsg
it astounds me for a reason...,btohqsg
the one thing you really need to learn is to form coherent discussion points and statements,btohqsg
like forget all your actual logic,btohqsg
the amount of hoops i need to jump through to even see what you’re talking about,btohqsg
what is there to discuss? Progress is limited...Everything has a limit...,btohqsg
not like about 50 years ago..some people decided it would be astronomically fantastic to mix chemsitry and physics together and end the whole world..But why did it stop? cause there was a limit,btohqsg
i think discussing this is 10x better than talking to said person,btohqsg
"time to change this gc name to ""subject matter expert""",btohqsg
ok you’re gonna bring physics into this …,btohqsg
chemistry is literally and i mean literally based on physics. the so called mixing is still ongoing right now everywhere.,btohqsg
u vroom vroom car off the bridge la,btohqsg
Yes but  why did humans all collectively decided that it was a bad idea to continue mixing explosive yield of physics and chemical combustion of chemistry together?,btohqsg
that doesn’t halt the progress of the field,btohqsg
do you see people testing nuclear bombs?,btohqsg
ill rephrase it  do you see people testing nuclear bombs on civillians,btohqsg
hello even a cs major knows,btohqsg
there had to be a reason....that all these activities stop,btohqsg
that’s changing your point when you’re wrong,btohqsg
DOOD GOES FROM EVERYTHING IS AR/VR TO EVERYTHING IS VR AND WORLD CREATION IN A SPLIT,btohqsg
i wonder why the world decided that killing people is wrong!,btohqsg
theres some people id really sometimes want to..,btohqsg
im very sure they have not considering...human life is nothing but a flesh of meat for people,btohqsg
more worth thank talking to this guy,btohqsg
i need you to decouple ethical arguments from progress in scientific understanding and development,btohqsg
no im actually not  im just being realistic like ive said x1000 times before,btohqsg
just like how you easily decouple logic from your brain,btohqsg
ethics is a big issue when it comes to research and development ykno,btohqsg
you can live in your dream world where you think people actually have morals and ethics...when in reality you live in a world where its just becoming obsolete,btohqsg
in my dream world i wouldn’t be having this sort of convo with anyone,btohqsg
kindly tell that to your profs when you start uni,btohqsg
in my dream i wouldnt be wanting to -,btohqsg
some idiots like me can go in,btohqsg
you dont know how many people with no future that are more infuriating than a 6 year old screaming and shouting are in my shit sch,btohqsg
come to my shit sch where even my prof says the prev aftnn class is so noisy,btohqsg
youd wanna beat a bitch up,btohqsg
you think...i doubt you are right,btohqsg
my brain collapsed in this convo,btohqsg
as much as i didnt vibe with r  hes probably smarter and more knowledgeable than you,btohqsg
you believe what you want  ill just focus on my poly,btohqsg
sigh he’s the gonna be the one writing papers that conspiracy theorists will read  believe and cite,btohqsg
and i need to take the effort to disprove,btohqsg
"i just wanna say  youre 19  mature up a lil  take come criticism  learn from it. you wanna maintain your gpa of 2 slay  you can do this. but as much as everyone who knows me for never comparing based on education  i think you shouldnt be debating that your sentiments are right to experts in our field  snorlax or if you know him best ""si yan"" for physics  neko ""NamelessCat"" and me for computer scienceand remember to cite Si Yan for your physics paper",btohqsg
i never once said that i was totally right...you realise my statements are all generalisation..generalisation that if given another axis to argue with would become totally one sided and false,btohqsg
can’t wait to build a fucking quantum computer and be told by author “FutureofRyan” that,btohqsg
there has to be a reason why i’m doing it,btohqsg
it can’t be just bc i wanna progress science,btohqsg
bc everyone that wants to advance science can only be in it for nefarious reasons,btohqsg
maybe my quantum computer will let me shrink down like antman and go inside everyone to spy on them,btohqsg
i learn ML and AI for u,btohqsg
1 wrong will undo 100 rights,btohqsg
nvm fuck around and find out..i shall,btohqsg
your wrong eliminated 100 brain cells of mine,btohqsg
we need a century of charitable events to make up for each year of this existence,btohqsg
"if i delete my research and change it to analysis of the brain for people who need to learn unrigidity  ill cite ""FutureOfRyan""",btohqsg
trust me...im not the only one with this mindset. Im just not important enough to do anything,btohqsg
yea but youre the loudest in the room today,btohqsg
someone that generalises with no minimal understanding of the field can only be classified as insane or a conspiracy theorist,btohqsg
i’d believe flat earthers over you at this point,btohqsg
yea but youre the loudest in the room today,btohqsg
debate when youre less rigid in your mindset,btohqsg
im getting more permanent head damage than my phd,btohqsg
dw  ill save you the trouble,btohqsg
wish you’d say that 19 years ago,btohqsg
pls support my beads business since im really bored,btohqsg
whats w yall beefing in the gc ?,btohqsg

Someone dmed me to ask me why I never spot the physics qns correctly,btohqsg
I just started my journey back home,btohqsg
I think they js want u,btohqsg
There's someone in my uni batch who cheesed the system,btohqsg
Then flew back 2 weeks later to ORD,btohqsg
Then fly back to uni again,btohqsg
delulu is the solulu and it becomes trululu,btohqsg
He's from 1 high school batch later,btohqsg
Because his superiors were nice and allowed this arrangement,btohqsg
like girl maths makes us happy,btohqsg
I pray that people take girl math unironically,btohqsg
Reality can be whatever I want,btohqsg
Basically it's a way of justifying one (normally girls) make bad spending decisions cuz they can't do math stereotypically,btohqsg
hi is there any answers key for o level pure bio paper 2 6093,btohqsg
Don't u have a levels in like 3 dYs,btohqsg
Shud I take a levels for fun next yr,btohqsg
I fr nth to do nowadays the only things I do is just program macros to automate my ns work,btohqsg
I automated all my work so far alr,btohqsg
I literally go camp press buttons then mess with people for rest of the day,btohqsg
If o levels is cheaper I'll take o levels,btohqsg
Wait but it's a waste of time,btohqsg
I need sit in the exam hall for 1-3h,btohqsg
I alr did that for like subjects I bother reading out of syllabus stuff for,btohqsg
But the issue is sciences doesn't ask qns that allow you to write out of syllabus stuff maybe chem but physics very rare the qn will enable it,btohqsg
I took science stream for the free A,btohqsg
And cuz ej doesn't offer geog hist lit mafh,btohqsg
U gonna be like one of yhe many students out thr taking pcme,btohqsg
If I were to retake ill prolly just take h1 econs for the lols,btohqsg
TM geog is just budget ri geog,btohqsg
Cuz ri geog also teaches the wrong things just that they have higher calibre students,btohqsg
Sorry if this is the wrong chat but ig it's the only one findable 😅Hi guys does the specialization track of my diploma matter ?Like lets say If I am applying to a uni course that is more human related but I chose the food science  track instead of the biologics research track but it's still under the acceptable Diploma (still under science)About to choose my specialization track soon,btohqsg
depends  i have some comp sci people who were from food sciences  nursing  etc,btohqsg
does girl math rly make girls happy? u buy it once  u reapply  reapply until no money  no money then cry  then cry and realise you manipulated yourself  and then cus it’s become your trait u find manipulative men  and then he breaks up and you’re unhappy again. hence  you shld never girl math,btohqsg
She's the same person that said she wanna marry someone rich,btohqsg
i didn’t say i rely on girls maths but i saw some ppl doing it on tik tok,btohqsg
it’s okay 😞 delusional is js manipulation,btohqsg

ehh since when getting a haircut in sg is expensive,btohqsg
can give me some recommendations where to trim hair under $14,btohqsg
i dont trust kcut cause they literally made my frnd bald,btohqsg
a haircut in qhouse is $18 now wtf,btohqsg
idk went to dhoby ghaut outlet,btohqsg
east got lots of cheap options,btohqsg
price in punggol getting expensive somehow,btohqsg
i got one near my house $3 only 😎😎,btohqsg
if u trust them well enuf  go to the kimage sch one it’s below 10,btohqsg
that’s why ur hair like that,btohqsg
cn i js say i love how all the ppl who responded are guys except laoban,btohqsg
Best for training new hair stylists,btohqsg
i mean qb they recently made it so guys cheaper than girls,btohqsg
was it worth it?...i doubt so..but 100 is still 100,btohqsg
"trust me on this...im not dumb  i did not mean to hurt anyone. thats why i never caps my letters when i had a argumentThe ""mission"" ended when a admin said ""stfu""...That was all that was needed",btohqsg
welp..now you know more about me.🤣,btohqsg
All i needed was for a admin to say stfu to me..and i would have gotten my 100..but bedok  the most active admin took 6 months to say that to me,btohqsg
I never caps my letters when I had an argumentREAL,btohqsg
didn't you find that was weird whenever i had a argument?,btohqsg
No I still think ur weird,btohqsg
oh...nvm...my reputation is gone but i still got 100,btohqsg
90 a week  so 360 a month,btohqsg
i came in as a human and became a car,btohqsg
at least im not spreading tiktok misinformation,btohqsg
nothing to defend  im just a normal guy in a normal world,btohqsg
im thinking of diff ways to make money  from stocks to reselling...so yea with my attitude i feel like im constantly trying to better myself which is what normal people do,btohqsg
ok ok  there is no need for any discussion,btohqsg
i wont allow myself to do that,btohqsg
cause im still doing relatively ok in school  thats why,btohqsg
least i leave school with some knowledge better than none,btohqsg
I just realised how insane this is,btohqsg
Even bedok makes more money in 7 months,btohqsg
its not like i can change it right now  all i can do is work and hope that i can improve that gpa by the end of this sem,btohqsg
i dont ever consider such words as anything against me  i know its all for my own good,btohqsg
ive asked my other poly friends   objectively they have said that if i had been in another poly  my gpa would be about 2.5-2.8,btohqsg
arent you like 19 why are you selling stocks,btohqsg
do you have any plans to get into university?,btohqsg
if your GPA is lower than that uni is a gone case,btohqsg
considering his message im guessing its in the low 2s,btohqsg
and i never failed a single module,btohqsg
top ten reasons not to go rp,btohqsg
Really do but below 2 is,btohqsg
Very very little chance of going to a public uni,btohqsg
how are u below 2 if u never failed a mod,btohqsg
thats why i said its rp system,btohqsg
if i had my results in any other poly..it would be a 2.5-2.8,btohqsg
hot take : better to go any ITE than RP,btohqsg
i think with the standard now it needs to be 3 already,btohqsg
what course did u even go to with 26 wtf,btohqsg
cip  then now in digital design,btohqsg
if u culdnt go into another poly for the course u want i would just say go to rp,btohqsg
Anyways make the most of your circumstances. Be diligent in your work,btohqsg
You can’t change the past but you can control the future to some extent,btohqsg
oh shit that man got a STACKED portfolio,btohqsg
But lowkey feel bad for the guy,btohqsg
Just knowing everything you achieve is because of daddy’s money,btohqsg
ive mentioned it countless times  its either yall dont want to listen or failed to grasp how different rp's system is,btohqsg
most nepo people dont even recognise this tbh,btohqsg
i had a friend that passed 1/5 modules for a sem  she got 1.07 gpa,btohqsg
werent polytechnics supposed to promote holistic/hands on learning why the fuck are there daily tests,btohqsg
If she got B for the 1 mod,btohqsg
The overall should be above 1,btohqsg
This was the sem i ended my 1.81 gpa with,btohqsg
i thought only big 3 is 3.6+,btohqsg
you telling me those grades equate to a 1.81gpa?,btohqsg
Ye the intern programs are wonderful,btohqsg
they’re funding for GEIP is wild,btohqsg
give me a sec  i did some grade calculation b4,btohqsg
also you cant blame RP if youre getting B C and D,btohqsg
Ye bruh a D grade is like,btohqsg
who ask u get C and D,btohqsg
Ye this is the same as NP,btohqsg
bruh you think i am actively trying to?,btohqsg
please tell me theres an automated poly calculator for gpa,btohqsg
Wait what I didn’t even know it’s possible to get 1.81,btohqsg
there is still a msa and ese,btohqsg
RP is actually a scam bro,btohqsg
Act thought RP is easier to score in GPA for certain courses compared to NP and SP,btohqsg
At least that’s the tactic some of my friends used,btohqsg
what do people even learn in business course actually,btohqsg
for a long time i thought it was econs but watered down,btohqsg
yea...i withnessed it firsthand  ive said it countless of times...rp does not regulates how the lecturers give grades...the only thing they do is ask lecturers that fail students to write a whole report on why they failed them,btohqsg
If lecturers want to they can level 4 both this,btohqsg
and this..then level 2 our aks or attainments of skills and knowledge ...and we still get a B,btohqsg
how is RP a real poly,btohqsg
they can easily manipulate the grading system to fit the grade they feel like giving,btohqsg
that was literally what ive been asking since i ended sem1,btohqsg
that's why im not actually giving excuses...im legit already trying my hardest,btohqsg
but i cant do anything about a system that was built so badly from the start,btohqsg
if ur choosing between ITE or RP  go ITE,btohqsg
at least ITE isnt so rigged,btohqsg
ur getting C and D bro its not entirely the system,btohqsg
nope im already 2 years in alr  im interning next sem,btohqsg
Lol you know a poly’s bad when this statement isn’t a take as hot as the sun,btohqsg
it is  my classmates using chatgpting to get their A and B grades,btohqsg
only reason u should go RP is sonic arts,btohqsg
while im trying to be actually honest to my ownself...,btohqsg
The sports courses are pretty ok,btohqsg
But I don’t think the people in them study anyways LOL,btohqsg
im not chatgpting any of my quizes...the lecturers said b4 its not allowed..but i see my classmates constantly doing it,btohqsg
and im slowly falling into the pressure to actually use it,btohqsg
if he was ACTUALLY rigged  he would still be getting more Bs,btohqsg
anything below just means hes doing jack shit,btohqsg
They don’t want it to happen they should design a more foolproof system,btohqsg
ITE people are nice msot of the time,btohqsg
forget salary his literal chance to uni,btohqsg
Nah it’s important but it doesn’t alter the trajectory of your life that much,btohqsg
What it says about the character that you Hoe,btohqsg
yea i will for the next quiz,btohqsg
tf do they even quiz u on for it to be so shit,btohqsg
its not that far from what other polys i dont think  but my classmates told me that students from other poly's are not taught as much as rp students,btohqsg
I went to the inaugural apex day,btohqsg
i went to row dragon boat,btohqsg
I went for the programming class - stupid idea it was too basic😂,btohqsg
had a good talk with an airix ME5,btohqsg
Then I go play Badminton afterwards,btohqsg
most of us octs went to do sports,btohqsg
cuz if u did sports can nights out after,btohqsg
then my course went to do db lo vv fun,btohqsg
if i dropout  i have to pay a penalty fee. But yea i'll see how i end poly first,btohqsg
how does one get below 2 if u attend sch,btohqsg
cb gna be the first hcl student to get f9 for normal chinese o level 🤡,btohqsg
ya lorh..this one tao jia huan jia,btohqsg
i know a few fellas that got 1.5,btohqsg
there is someone in my diploma with a gpa below 1,btohqsg
there was 2 in my diploma last sem,btohqsg
if your gpa cannot by laoban dou hua,btohqsg
the one classmate that had a 1.04 gpa has her graduation scheduled in may 2026,btohqsg
cb later i talk so much my last sem fly,btohqsg
i hard carried my imp group for 1 sem,btohqsg
cuz those dogs dw to do work,btohqsg
because of that module i never get 4,btohqsg
i forgot you got wisp next sem,btohqsg
is modules can go to hell,btohqsg
There is a saying for people that unfortunately come rp..dont do more than you are suppose to,btohqsg
dont be geh kiang and do all the slides or ppt,btohqsg
its the break point for determining whether you get a D or A,btohqsg
when you need to maintain gpa  you don't have choice bro,btohqsg
my poly you do that..you gone case,btohqsg
rp trash their own instituition lmao...others dont have to do it,btohqsg
my friend got 3.9 in rp grading system,btohqsg
i cannot fathom how he do it,btohqsg
how do you even get 2,btohqsg
i got 1.81  If my overall grade across 5 modules Was D..it would be 1.5,btohqsg
time for you to grind your butts off,btohqsg
got it I find one day go thr look,btohqsg
all my project im the leader so i dont have that issue,btohqsg
had a classmate that was also the leader..until the date of interview  everybody did not even do their part,btohqsg
in the end she just decided to do her part and leave the rest to fend for themselves,btohqsg
she got A  the other 4 members got D,btohqsg
doesnt mean youre the leader means you know how to delegate tasks,btohqsg
she alr told everybody their roles but the other 4 did not do their portion..so she just told the teacher in the end that she did her part while the other 4 slacked,btohqsg
telling is diff from managing the team well you can be a great student but may not be good with handling slackers,btohqsg
i mean the slackers mia'ed on her..she also cant do much,btohqsg
told them off n they got scared,btohqsg
actually because precisely of what i mentioned earlier..all 4 of the other members predicted the faci was not going to give them a E for not doing anything..since she does not look like the type that would want to write lenghty reports for the failure of a studentThey were right so my friend was literally left in the dark of their plan,btohqsg
"the only thing i was blessed is 2 of them were ok  the other 2 i just show the project  straight up said ""dont give me bs that udk how to do because the other 2 dk they do their own research"" then i just say lor you dont want A just let me know  i dont mind not including you",btohqsg
that is one downside to the grading system in rp..because of the lenghty report situation...many faci's try their best to never fail students..the only way you would tentalively fail is honestly for attendance,btohqsg
because attendance is regulated...grades are not,btohqsg
then they diam lor and do shit work  i told them off and said if they want  they take over leadership  then cuz no one want to lead then they no choice to do lor,btohqsg
people i’ve worked with fortunately care enough about their gpa to at least take instruction from me if they cmi bc i was recognised as the one to follow,btohqsg
"ours we dk if peer eval is impt so i just say ""if you dont want to do the work  let me know  we wont include you and youll get your A  but dont come and fuck up our project""",btohqsg
i’ve never had peer evaluation within a group in uni,btohqsg
ours got the evaluation section of who did what  n the submission need explain ma so q obvious who did work,btohqsg
during one of my graded assignments..when we had to explain some components we did...we realised like 3 of them were not done by any of us,btohqsg
then my friend did some digging and realise her acc was hacked into,btohqsg
and the hackers...may have added those components inside,btohqsg
Am I the only one who think that I'm getting worse as the years go by?,btohqsg
Anyone else experiencing the same thoughts?,btohqsg
my braincells go in a rollercoaster ride,btohqsg
js me or poly likes to add random bullshit to make poly not like a sch but a shitting around play zone,btohqsg
cause that’s how i feel ☝️,btohqsg
like i wont say my sch is like that  but other sch seems to look like wtv i js said,btohqsg
like np changing their logo into some shitty ass pasta shapes,btohqsg
and im saying the poly itself  not the students,btohqsg
i mean..we had a pe module..that had a quiz,btohqsg
mine doesn’t look as shitty as yours tbh,btohqsg
like yall have a lot of weird stuff can’t lie,btohqsg
but how many times can you take it?,btohqsg
skill issue  my mon and wed off,btohqsg
skill issue  my sat & sun off,btohqsg
HAHA bro can’t escape just yet,btohqsg
"Ill show you what is called ""Poly adding useless"" shit",btohqsg
Giving a quiz  but its 999 tries,btohqsg
no way i am graduating with the new np logo on my cert,btohqsg
ok the fact that you did it 9 times is concerning,btohqsg
and still didn’t get full marks,btohqsg
and then theres me who once used my unlimited tried to resubmit my report until i felt like its good,btohqsg
you see this in uni too,btohqsg
that’s a report  always can be improved but a quiz is a right or wrong..,btohqsg
its a multiple choice with multiple options,btohqsg
i’ve seen that in uni too,btohqsg
