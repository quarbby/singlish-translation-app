Actually guys no offense   but comparing this and that won't do u Amy good .. if u know how to work efficiently then any platform u can make money.. if u think otherwise leave the platform instead of still doing it and sulking about it .. cause honestly speaking if a new person ask for advise .. all I can see it people putting it down for them .. actually those are whom that do not invest their time proper.. so I suggest newbies just venture out and see whether it suits u.. some make 10k thru the platform while others make 2k.. it depends on what u are willing to sacrifice .. every industry there is risk and sacrifices   there is no easy job.. even doctors have risk in their job.. so either u take the risk or just continue to condemn everything,btohqsg
Tbh I like llm is more on really can come out from the car and walk here and there,btohqsg
I choice to come in llm that is why I trying out to find out to earn more I donâ€™t mind spend 10 hours hard work looking at the screen all time when is driving try to get the job as always have the issue is the job have been taken donâ€™t give up try again,btohqsg
Iâ€™m ok for this job if not wonâ€™t go and take a rent car for 6 mth daily 65$ to do llm,btohqsg
Wow 10k. Really work no day no night. Maybe 7days a weekðŸ˜…If no family no gf ok la.,btohqsg
Sharing my thinking is to see over this grp do it have anyone same like me working for 10 hours a day for 6day a week only can do 150-200 a day if it is that so I will feel that I never do anything wrong never miss away any step.,btohqsg
Just want to ask   anyone of your driving own car or rental thinking of trade in / buying a new car ? I mean with the current coe keep rising also any of your interested ?,btohqsg
Low coe hard to sell away if you never drive more then 3.5 year,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone need touch up paint ðŸ˜‚ I bought the wrong one for my car.,btohqsg
Yes 10k .. u work hard for it . Even if got family and u need the money to support your family then u will do it.. that's really up to individual and time management..,btohqsg
Some might not need to earn that amount   and that's why I said have a traget..n,btohqsg
Can earn 10k u also got no time to go spend . Everyday on the road,btohqsg
Yes soldiers and shipping line professionals are also away from their family..,btohqsg
There is no easy way out being a Singaporean..,btohqsg
From this I can see how u actually think..  u just don't earn to spend dude.. there are many more things that u have to earn for..,btohqsg
Strike a balance... Enough to use can liao... This kind are hard money...,btohqsg
U don't need a day off to settle ur bills do u ?,btohqsg

Ya lo. Actually don't care grab   llm or whichever platform. Do part time can already. Need to have a stable income,btohqsg
Do a bit help pump petrolðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
Well said .. but the question is how stable is your stable ?,btohqsg
Yeah. Cover car costs can liao,btohqsg
Stable means every mth you get the same amount of salary. Then delivery platform to cover your livings like makan bill  car cost,btohqsg
What if u lose ur stable job one day ?,btohqsg
Then if your doing delivery job  do first then in the mean time find job,btohqsg
So if delivery platform don't need manpower liao then how,btohqsg
What makes u think delivery job cannot be a full time job ?,btohqsg
Then what makes u think delivery cannot be a part time job?,btohqsg
delivery means manpower.. so I don't understand how delivery job won't need manpower.. especially with technology this days.. everyone ordering online .. so exports come in SG after that u think drones will deliver ?,btohqsg
Sometimes depends on luck  right time right place also,btohqsg
I never said it can't .. for many delivery jobs are PT jobs just to compliment their expenses.. bit for alot delivery jobs are full time too and they are earning pretty well,btohqsg
If you guys wanna get new or used car let me know okay ? I can try to help you guys to secure a lower rate and much more affordable monthly installment guys ! :) . Help help each other,btohqsg
