Im not too sure if its accurate but perhaps he may have used to work in very labour intensive jobs so he just wants to rest now,btohqsg
I have coursemates in the same course as him who told me stories,btohqsg
And I also like cats too 😊,btohqsg
But nvm shant say much here since he left,btohqsg
The reason why he changed was weird ba,btohqsg
Cos he couldnt do a graded assignment  and end up he seeked help from a poly student for it,btohqsg
If u all were wondering why he changed,btohqsg
ya hes working as a gardener right now and plus i guess the pain caused by the deterioration of his muscles cos of age might be a cause too,btohqsg
idk what im saying but thats just what the doc said,btohqsg
AHA he exposed his own ass,btohqsg
so basically his conquest for better grades got the better of his ego,btohqsg
My fren in the same course as him said so,btohqsg
It's okay. Make sure to spend time on yourself  rest and exercise too :)),btohqsg
I mean I don't blame him I would do the same too HAHA,btohqsg
But he agrees that he has been flamed less recently,btohqsg
takes guts to seek help from people u might've deemed lesser than u,btohqsg
It is that moment he knew he fked up,btohqsg
This is like the bird eating a biscuit meme,btohqsg
better knowing in sch than in the workforce,btohqsg
Hes smart la  but I guess its impossible for one to be smart in all areas,btohqsg
Hey anyone free this sunday to deliver meals to homebound seniors in Toa Payoh?,btohqsg
I want to know the context behind your pfpmonk carrying gun... Myanmar or what,btohqsg
occupied from 8am to 9pm sorry man =.=,btohqsg
Why was this source published? Explain.    Anyone can help with this?,btohqsg
Anyone knows what Gerentoglogy is like,btohqsg
You know the old people studies,btohqsg
News and education  so it’s an unbiased source,btohqsg
Purpose question so just write a VAMIE,btohqsg
Okay so the context is that a monk is Thailand was incarcerated for 2 days for trespassing on a private forest and complained that he was brutalised throughout the entire process. Since he was ignored  he took up his saffron robes and decided to storm the Thai Parliament and held 30 people hostage.https://www.voanews.com/archive/thai-police-arrest-armed-buddhist-monk-2002-05-22Bhiaku-47,btohqsg
i know of people in both,btohqsg
that doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of burmese buddhism ah we literally have like monks advocating for genocide against the rhohingyas,btohqsg
really that's just wrong on so many buddhist levels man,btohqsg
uhhh no it's a figure of speech,btohqsg
"You know how American television shows like to throw the word ""we"" around a lot",btohqsg
regardless of whether it actually encompasses the person speaking it plus the audience they're addressing,btohqsg
i can give u my friend's contact she just graduated from gerontology in tp not long ago. intz?,btohqsg
thai parliament also lowkey messed up nowadays..,btohqsg
at least they had a parliament back in 2002...,btohqsg
before the shinawatra family got yeeted out,btohqsg
I didn't follow the Thai protests news too much  thai parliament is dissolved now or?,btohqsg
it's still there but i think the pm is a general or sth,btohqsg
and the general now wants to get into politics,btohqsg
and so does one of the princesses of the royal family,btohqsg
🤔 was chanric famous on tele or discord,btohqsg
I still don’t know what to do,btohqsg
Like I’m taking Os this year,btohqsg
I’m thinking of going through early childhood,btohqsg
the kids take care of you,btohqsg
i mean they are cute and all,btohqsg
you really have to be on the ball and what not,btohqsg
I don't think kids r cute,btohqsg
Is there pedos in the course?,btohqsg
we dont talk about that here,btohqsg
Do you think pedos purposely go into the course,btohqsg
he likes killing ppl  so he does a job that kinda enables it,btohqsg
thers a fk tonne of restrictions,btohqsg
ok since your name is harry,btohqsg
i shall assume you're a dude,btohqsg
theres lots of what u can or cant do as an educator,btohqsg
now from ages 6 months - 2 years,btohqsg
and you can like initiate hugs and all that,btohqsg
as in you'll find a lot more opportunities,btohqsg
i didnt take social work but i can explain more about gerontology,btohqsg
How you know all these things,btohqsg
having worked in a few aspects of the eldercare industry myself,btohqsg
cos i vol regularly with seniors,btohqsg
Are u in uni or poly or jc,btohqsg
so u might have a gerontology diploma but it covers theoretical aspects e.g how the human body is like affected by ageing  or like the healthcare landscape in sg for seniors etc etc,btohqsg
lol what i thought u were uni alr@ayamnotarobot,btohqsg
i hopped around a bit la,btohqsg
lmao i started in jc  then went to sp to dnhw  then went to np to do early childhood  then im in rp now doing social enterprise,btohqsg

i came here to learn how to plan exercises for seniors,btohqsg
Wait by right you must be 23 years old,btohqsg
i spent less than 1 year in each,btohqsg
What a waste of time and money,btohqsg
i managed to pay off everything,btohqsg
with my freshman scholarship from rp,btohqsg
poly isnt as exp as u think,btohqsg
Wah you must be very rich to have all these,btohqsg
sorry I know its super late but whats their reddit u/asking for a friend...,btohqsg
Bruh you know it’s a lie,btohqsg
Asking for a friend is always a lie,btohqsg

But just let bygones be bygones,btohqsg

and find what you line ultimately,btohqsg
hope we aren’t too bright for y’all,btohqsg
would y’all like candles instead of lightbulbs,btohqsg
we aren't a couple so no worry,btohqsg
I like lightbulbs more cos sometimes candles got this smell and I don’t really like the smell,btohqsg

If there is/are no link(s) provided for you to upload the relevant documents  this means you are not required to submit any documents for verifications. If we require more information from you  we will contact you via email or your contact number.,btohqsg

Hello. Can I ask if anyone have 2020 prelim papers for O levels? Meaning like those top sch exam paper softcopies,btohqsg
hi so i messed up my ntu application by forgetting to submit parts of the relevant documents. the first time was my full testimonial and the second (now) was my cca records. they previously helped me to reset the submission and now I sent them another email.may I ask if this will affect my chances of admission as they may feel that I am troubling them or careless? I wrote the email with sincerity and apologised.,btohqsg
Please help as I really would like to get into NTU business. If it matters  I have 75rp (slightly higher than last year’s IGP) and have completed ABA with fuelling passion in business degree,btohqsg
just hope for the best and don’t do it again,btohqsg
i thought can use the aces.nus to add stuff in,btohqsg
ah ok  i personally dont think it will affect  cos like the people helping u add the stuff back and doing the form shouldnt be the ones deciding whether u shld enter the course or not,btohqsg
i also left out an entire Achviement section blank with personal statement etc cos i thought can fill up later. i also email them and they say help me add in  quite friendly  idt will compromise ur chacnes in anyway,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know  for NUS  if I applied during early admission (using prelim results)  how do I add in my A Level results in the app form? Cus I can only edit my particulars & course choices.,btohqsg
iirc  they will get your A level results directly from MOE.,btohqsg
Anybody know any good sources for current affairs??,btohqsg
Wikipedia if you want something quick (but at the same time you gotta check their sources),btohqsg
I watch ibx2cat videos haha but thats leaning towards entertainment alr,btohqsg
and also reddit frontpage but beware its full of libtards,btohqsg
I haven't even complete my application wtf,btohqsg
once my swab test is negative but I still have MC  can I go out?,btohqsg
yeah best to stay home until the mc period ends,btohqsg
Are u in ns or uni alr,btohqsg
Wym lucky I suffered for 1 year 1 month alr,btohqsg
I served mine in full for like 1 yr 6mths,btohqsg
Ye 2 yrs of jc were the fastest ever,btohqsg
I think mine at best I was in camp for like 8/9 months out of 13,btohqsg
Rest is cb and wfh HAHAH,btohqsg
n my bf has just started in jan HAHAHAH,btohqsg
You'll be out soon ; ),btohqsg

Enjoy free food and monetary rewards for IPPT,btohqsg
Anybody received their uni application  news alr,btohqsg
Meanwhile supposedly 6.8 million ppl attended NUS e-open house this yr,btohqsg
That's more than the SG population,btohqsg
maybe international students? like from overseas,btohqsg
That means like millions of people overseas were interested in NUS,btohqsg
Hope u get the help u need,btohqsg
That's why it's insane to me,btohqsg
But maybe 11th on QS makes for a good advertisement,btohqsg
Looks like someone hit their KPI for promotion,btohqsg
May I know where you got the 6.8 million figure from??,btohqsg
is there season parking if u stay in ntu halls?,btohqsg
it's like only for certain zone carparks right,btohqsg
so is it even worth buying season parking,btohqsg
It's worth if you're gonna drive everyday. Not worth if hall imho coz you're already in campus..,btohqsg
The lessons are all concentrated on a few locations only  so the season parking in those areas are worth if you need to go campus everyday,btohqsg
To enter the IP from PSLE,btohqsg
is there an interview required? Or is it purely through PSLE,btohqsg
Some schools require interview and selection test,btohqsg
I think they look through your kindergarten results,btohqsg
Usually they are specialised schools like SST NUSH Sota,btohqsg
anyone taking H1/H2 cse can share resourcessss?,btohqsg
Heyhey anyone here know whats 剧本杀 ！ Know chinese well can pm me :)   Play game and bond with new people !,btohqsg
I'm just commenting so nobody will tag me later. Been too busy to keep up with China stuff and my CSE notes are mostly outdated at this point. Dont tag me HAHA. Skills I still can help but wait until May thanks.,btohqsg
my teacher doesnt provide enough resources TT,btohqsg
Tbh nobody can be worse than my ex-teacher,btohqsg
my teacher comes in late and start class 30 min after actual lesson time,btohqsg
It was so bad that I learnt even more from a less experienced CSE teacher  and the HOD of Humanities have to get the less-experienced CSE teacher to hold a crashcourse for our class like one week before the A levels  that bad.,btohqsg
same i even thought of asking my gp teacher to read my essays,btohqsg
because my cse teacher dont read up regularly on china affairs,btohqsg
Since J1 i alr wanted to rid us of the crappy teacher but my classmates were not riled up enough  only like last stretch of JC then tell HOD they give up hope on CSE  and I was like  y'all get angry with me earlier  we could've learnt more effectively and scored better haiz,btohqsg
Now only March   get angry now.,btohqsg
Anyone knows any opportunities to volunteer during the March holidays for under 18?,btohqsg
guys which supermarket chain has the cheapest coriander,btohqsg

I am intending to apply to poly thru eae this way and my last gpa was 2.3 the thing I kinda wanted this course initially but now I have lost interest and I wanna switch to engineering in SP  may I know is it possible to apply to a unrelated course in poly and what are the chances of getting in?I have registered for 2 workshops (ITE CoC in Data Analytics using Excel and ITE CoC in Piloting in Unmanned Aircraft under 7kg) in relation to engineering in dip in aerospace electronics in SP however I am aiming to go for dip in common engineering programme as I am very unsure of this field and I wanna make sure I choose the right pathway for myself.Thanks all in advance :)),btohqsg

Dude  that's a client. The clients are not illegal  it's typically the websites that host the torrent files which are illegal.,btohqsg
Wish we can turn back time,btohqsg
Wait  so the only ethical website right now which utilises torrent is the Ubuntu website?,btohqsg
$ curl https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.10/ubuntu-20.10-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent?_ga=2.215539088.661033949.1615733924-1461280613.1573013163 --output download && file download% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  CurrentDload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed100  219k  100  219k    0     0   106k      0  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  106kdownload: BitTorrent file,btohqsg
i'm providing an example of a legitimate site that has a legitimate use for torrents,btohqsg
Oh  are they any more examples?,btohqsg
i'm sure if you look around  servers that host downloads may have a torrent counterpart as well,btohqsg
Thank you! Didn't know Ubuntu uses Torrent as a way to download their kernel.,btohqsg
it's just another file sharing method  but of course the decentralised nature of it makes it a good choice for illegal resources to be shared via it,btohqsg
but i mean lots of illegal resources are also shared using the cloud like mega or google drive so it's not just torrents doing all the dirty work,btohqsg
Jiang Ying is my good friend,btohqsg
we all know him very well 😄,btohqsg
It only feels like yesterday that I enlisted,btohqsg
Go near a black hole to ORD immediately,btohqsg
I'll just launch myself in a space shuttle that can travel at the speed of light,btohqsg
the one i had was not compatible w the specs i required and it was just not practical to bring it to sch cuz it was big and heavy and dying. so it's rly up to u  if the one you have is working just fine and there aren't any problems with it and u don't require a specific laptop for your course  then don't buy a new one,btohqsg
