For CGH bill pay through health buddy  can pay by Citi rewards without the AmaZe card?,btohqsg
Hihi  apply the hsbc t1 card via the singsaver flash deal to choose ps5  still can get the 20k miles if pay annual fee?,btohqsg
Iâ€™m not sure if you apply after 9 will consider the next day anot or totally canâ€™t apply,btohqsg
thanks for the warning..i decide to guide my friend to do his Tbills on 1st June Saturday then.. since Saturday can do during day time.,btohqsg
Does insurance payment (GE) give you cc points for crmc?,btohqsg
SSB is Mon-Sat  7am-9pm.Tbill is any time IIRC.,btohqsg
Not true also. But try not to be too far off the required salary mark.,btohqsg
Uob lady solitaire 10k per month is too far ahead... can't reach,btohqsg
Lucky the uob saving account.. they never ask for too much for the extra 2 miles..,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not worth it leh.Unless you MS the lady card like some people who max $2000 every month to another card.,btohqsg
Pressured into clocking $1500 or more.,btohqsg
I heard many in aaron group go for it,btohqsg
Means must hit 1500 a month for extra 2 miles ?,btohqsg
To make it worth lo. Considering 1 miles is 1 cent.Now interest rate easily 3% up.,btohqsg
Go see video on uob lady saving acct  it is the opportunity cost u lose on interest verus miles u earn from it,btohqsg
Yes. Please support Chris video. ðŸ¥³,btohqsg
I saw it .. the guy forget his name .. recommend to put minimum 10k in lady account,btohqsg
I think optimal is 10k which is the most worth it,btohqsg
Then again.When one person needs miles  he can never get it at 1cent at that moment. So more miles is always better.We can always get money everywhere but miles are harder to come by. Also considering this factor.,btohqsg
Guys any better fixed deposit rate than Syfe cash+?,btohqsg
Haha depend on individual  miles to me not as attractive as cash,btohqsg
You need to understand differences between fixed deposit vs syfe investment. You canâ€™t have high returns and low risk together.,btohqsg
That's why is not really worth if paying coffee 2$ to 2.20 for a 5 blocks rewarding card...,btohqsg
Every month at work I try to hit 5.50 for uob preferred visa at ya kun,btohqsg
Donâ€™t say this. Everytime my macdonalds is something like $9.95  i will always donate to make it $10.  ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Syfe has cash+ guaranteedI think OP referring to that,btohqsg
