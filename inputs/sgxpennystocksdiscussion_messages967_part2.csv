👆More and more of Addvalue Tech's IDRS are sent to the sky. Addvalue has a 20% air time sharing with Viaset and hence we shall see its recurring income will steadily go up. One of the pennies that could become highly profitable over time...in my watch list for penny rally down the road. DYODD yah,btohqsg
Interestingly close matching time  all the $0.020 TAC cleared back up for SunMoon,btohqsg

Although I reduced back some Matex  recently. This one does have a recovery chance now since it does move at times along with JT which came to play today. Anyways  based on weekly  can tell they already flushed like dog.Thats why this one we call Dogtex.OSOD . DYoDD,btohqsg
Check out TOTM pattern before the big reversal bounce rally. Looks a little similar to Matex actually.Dyodd#ifonly,btohqsg
I buy 1 share also can chiong ..,btohqsg
$0.070 offer by controlling shareholder.Damn dirty this offer. It’s low ball. All retailers screwed over. Write in to SIAS too help for those who have AMOS.The company is worth much much more. NAV $0.30.Source:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/4O10Q6L7DH60U99M/819574_Offer%20Announcement.pdf,btohqsg
99.99% of retailers lose big on Amos/Gaylin,btohqsg
Will set up a group for Amos. Those who have can PM me. We Will need to write to SIAS for help.,btohqsg
This is Amos balance sheet.Total assets : $113 916 000Total liability : $49 785 000Net Assets: $ $64 131 000Net Asset per share based on 208 331 000 shares is $0.3078The current offer of $0.070 per share is low ball to the core. Unacceptable and dirty . That’s how they fk retailers over.Those who are in for the long game  can even consider to buy $0.070 and wait it out maybe.It will delist but then Carl Shaw needs a way out. It will be to average down his cost per share with this $0.070 then repackage Amos and sell off to a bigger player in the industry at FAIR VALUE.Which is likely to buy from us $0.070 (Step 1) and sell off at Fair Value of 0.30 to another private party. (Step. 2)IMO  I assume he already has a buyer in place to do Step 2  and thus he is doing Step 1 now.Well done 👏,btohqsg
HSI Futures up another 3.5%Our pennies should be good for near term. Can watch out more closely. Can see more BBs are in our market recently too.,btohqsg
