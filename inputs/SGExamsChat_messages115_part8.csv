Tinder is literally a platform where looks come first,btohqsg
but afterwards it becomes less impt,btohqsg
"I mean in a way  it depends ah... occasionally there are guys who see something beautiful in a conventionally ""ugly"" girl",btohqsg
It's not smart to expect anything else when you look at its design. So i dont get why people dislike it so muchbecauseof it,btohqsg
Why you so judgemental... looks are subjective to an extent srsly,btohqsg
Why people suddenly talk about tinder,btohqsg
human beings are inherently judgemental  if one doesnt have judgement they will die cuz they dunno poop from food,btohqsg
I don't think I can ever consider someone truly ugly just by looking at their face. Like if it's extreme examples like acid attack I might be shocked but that's as I said an extreme example,btohqsg
"To an extent we never really think of  dating others cos we somehow put a premium on ""assets"" and sexual chemistry üòê gotta admit I am also being judgemental but many singaporeans fall short of certain standards haha",btohqsg
Tbh I don't think I'll be able to date another person,btohqsg
My personality makes me more of a single kind,btohqsg
Sometimes I just prefer to be alone,btohqsg
Yeah like when it's time to be social I can talk,btohqsg
But usually I'd prefer not to,btohqsg
Anyway the topic has come up before  I'm not actually interested in dating anyone haha... I like being single too,btohqsg
I mean if you know why then it's all good,btohqsg
I do actually consider myself ace,btohqsg
Maybe at most grey ace but yeah,btohqsg
Long term outlook is important. Like both of us are really interested in scientific research üòÇ,btohqsg
u see  there's a reason why babies are all universally cute  cuz then parents parental instincts kick in to tkae care of them  ratio  symmetry and beaty are all objective things,btohqsg
Is she the best looking? Nah but I think easily top 30% hahah. If u consider assets then maybe top 10% üòÇ,btohqsg
I dont find babies cute personally,btohqsg
"I used to say aro ace but then I didn't want to restrict myself too much so I let myself go with a ""lets see what happens"" approach haha",btohqsg
I not ace I just not excited at the prospects of it all,btohqsg
I really like kids but I don't want my own,btohqsg
"Imagine holding a newborn and thinking ""so cute!"" Thats not!!!",btohqsg
This i can somewhat get behind,btohqsg
I can carry one around and play with one  I don't babysitting for abit as I always do with my cousins... but not my own  that's a nightmare HAHA,btohqsg
I was so excited I thought you gonna say cuz it's ACE COMBAT,btohqsg
A number of couples break up due to differences in long term outlook. Be careful of that...,btohqsg
Kids might be considered cute or sweet i guess. But not babies. They are all the same to me,btohqsg
Could be break up at 1 year 2 year or even 10 year mark... differences in long term plans.,btohqsg
No more investing talk bc neil is away... now rs talk ...,btohqsg
Oh  so this is a response/remark/comment about THAT YouTube?,btohqsg
no  I just not fissile material,btohqsg
Maybe I am the empty set,btohqsg
Are they really common? I mean I think it exists but statistically should be a small amount,btohqsg
Errrr that's ONE example out of many.,btohqsg
Didnt happen to me before. But I heard of...,btohqsg
I've dated only 5 or 6 girls though,btohqsg
Max 1 sticker at a time please,btohqsg
Hehee anyway pro-tip girls can be quite visual too la so just as girls show cleavage guys got other ways to flex also la... and I dont mean obscene pics that's so low class. But u get the idea hahahah,btohqsg
Bro we are not on this topic anymore üò≠üî´üò©,btohqsg
Ya girls can be visual too  they just need to draw me this,btohqsg
Give me the code to make it to while at that,btohqsg
My TeX + GraphViz not that stronk,btohqsg
I think I was fucking cute as a baby tho,btohqsg
Or maybe not cause I was underweight or something idk,btohqsg
But you grown up and became less cute,btohqsg
You already know how I look like,btohqsg
