for SGRV users to screenshot easier,btohqsg
this is perfect for checking for fake Type Rs and M3s and Mustang 5.0s,btohqsg
I basically did it to spot lancerlutions,btohqsg
But also to identify car models that I don't recognize,btohqsg
their obese fingers won't be able to type in captchas easily so this bot helps,btohqsg
lancerlutions are q easy to spot imo,btohqsg
what's harder is trying to weed out FD2Rs from all the FD not Rs,btohqsg
yeah this one is also a huge pet peeve of mine,btohqsg
basically FD2Rs have no rear keyhole  wider at the back,btohqsg
someone here posted a f430 with fake scuderia badges,btohqsg
so no keyhole in the boot,btohqsg
maybe a month or two ago,btohqsg
ok im losted on that cos not an exotic guy,btohqsg
what's the major diff between an f430 and a f430 scuderia,btohqsg
so even an FD2 not R  the 2.0 would have a keyhole,btohqsg
tuned engine  carbon bits  sport exhaust  a few other bits. but the main thing is its limited production and much more exclusive/expensive,btohqsg
but from what i do recall from past conversations  seems to be the case,btohqsg
that would be hard to spot from far,btohqsg
but no matter what  FD2.0 and FD2R have diff rear widths,btohqsg
also  FD2R stock bonnet has ridges,btohqsg
some bro took an upclose pic with the badges and one smart guy spotted it was fake because of the diffuser or exhaust tips or something,btohqsg
cos its nowhere near as obvious as EX vs evo,btohqsg
u really need to look fucking hard at times,btohqsg
cos there's way too many telltales,btohqsg
most people take 1.5/1.6 as the base,btohqsg
basically fuel cap and roof ridges,btohqsg
but alot don't go all the way,btohqsg
so when you see its got drums behind,btohqsg
you know for sure its cap,btohqsg
but even then its a clear sign cos evo's at minimum have floating caliper brakes from factory both front and rear,btohqsg
an EX GT would still have sliding single pots,btohqsg
i cannot recall if evo x has rear wiper,btohqsg
but the telltales from far alr so many that even rear wiper doesn't become a consideration,btohqsg
would probably work really well on 911s also. I suspect a lot of mofos are buying base 911s and badging them as S models,btohqsg
i remember renting a lancer CS5 at one point in time,btohqsg
and everyone was very confused because they thought it was a lancerlution,btohqsg
but for real it was NOT,btohqsg
the ones i notice most are E200s to E300s etc,btohqsg
being a bit raped is probably as likely as being a bit pregnant,btohqsg
but got wiper  discs all around  engine goes choo choo,btohqsg
there was a fucker that badged a E180 as a E43,btohqsg
ahhh yes the fucking mercs. I bet a ton of them are upbadged,btohqsg
i mean hey no one's actually gonna knock you for buying an E180 if you're just being honest about it,btohqsg
i consider taking the badges off acceptable too,btohqsg
1.5 tarbu for a 1.7 ton car,btohqsg
but if you upbadge then that deserves to be shamed,btohqsg
people who know will laugh their ass off,btohqsg
it makes a lot of sense to those with 3 inch or less penis,btohqsg
ironically i've had one person ask if my family car was a legit E250 or we changed the badges,btohqsg
wasting money to get either laughed at or ignored,btohqsg
