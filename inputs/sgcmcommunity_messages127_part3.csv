Think you go and take a look of the road tax after 10 year COE,btohqsg
Probably not  reason why I don‚Äôt buy EV is the charging and also want to zhng my car just to annoy my colleagues,btohqsg
Oh shit I just saw it,btohqsg
it is.also the road tax and insurance,btohqsg
Too expensive lah  probably in my affordability change isA3 Cabrio (No power)A5 Cabrio COE (Super affordable 2.0)A5 Cabrio PARF (Abit on high side but still might consider),btohqsg
Some people just want to swee only. Beside so fast  who can look at you!,btohqsg
And spend 80% of the time in the workshop?,btohqsg
You want the people to gawk in envy when you drive past mah,btohqsg
And body value in parts replacement! Woohoo!!!,btohqsg
People will look as long as you drive cabrio with roof down mah,btohqsg
Ok what about this  help me decideA3 Cabrio 2019 (140k)A5 Cabrio 2021 (230k)A5 Sportsback (180k)A5 Cabrio 2010 (90k),btohqsg
A3 Cab- I get to have cabriolet for cheap- Underpowered but doesn‚Äôt matter too much to meA5 Cab 2021- Cabrio- Good Techs- Not that underpowered- Have to go beyond my budget and ask wife to help out with costA5 Sedan- Mild Hybrid- Good Tech- Not that underpowered- Within budget- But no cabrio experienceA5 Cab 2010- Drink petrol- Old Tech- Within budget- Cabrio experience,btohqsg
I definitely think Cabrio is important to me but then because it‚Äôs a Cabrio  I‚Äôm being priced out from budget.But because I drove an old A5 Cabrio before  I also feel like the tech inside sucks so nice to have newer car. Looks better too,btohqsg
Just get one for D2D purposes,btohqsg
Old cabrio - the spares part hard to get,btohqsg
Cars are a luxury here  don‚Äôt go poor getting one.,btohqsg
ETA also between 3 to 6 months .,btohqsg
That depends . Sometimes need to go scape yard to search to some extend .,btohqsg
If I get A3  can Zhng the exhaust to pop boh with that tiny 1.4 TFSI,btohqsg
Sometimes the spares part cannot be fit and needs to be modified to fit . & it might last for a short span and got spoilt again .,btohqsg
Easy when your car is not the victim lor .,btohqsg
Singapore so dusty. I also hardly open when I was on the road .,btohqsg
When I was driving my A5 back then  100% of the time open unless raining. When I drove normal SUV  100% of the time open window unless raining LOL,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know isit me weird but I like to smell the air  especially the smell of truck exhaust,btohqsg
So if you ask me whether I‚Äôll fully utilise the cabrio roof then yes ah,btohqsg
Someone got the answer liao  but good to use for night drive,btohqsg
Wakaka anymore chicks I pick up  my wife will murder me,btohqsg
Merc ah? Don‚Äôt like the body shape leh,btohqsg
Oof my bad  looks very similar to one model from merc,btohqsg
Looks like I‚Äôll probably get A3 and Zhng the exhaust loInstall virtual cockpit and see if can retrofit some other stuff anot,btohqsg
You get your wife another car . Then she can go out with her bff or shopping or high tea . Where got the time to check on you .,btohqsg
She doesn‚Äôt drive  I‚Äôm her grab driver. She doesn‚Äôt go out either,btohqsg
I not speedster lehh  just need to get to work from CCK all the way to Loyang and back,btohqsg
Bruhh if I can afford 2 cars I won‚Äôt be thinking which car to buy,btohqsg
Just buy A5 Cab 2021 sua if that‚Äôs the case LOL,btohqsg
COE car 1.2kFun car 1.8kAdd total can buy the A5 Cab leh,btohqsg
Just buy the A5 to fit the bill  win win,btohqsg
But so low mileage for what  A3 dun need to sayang so much,btohqsg
Is true la but end of day the cost will still be higher to buy a second car,btohqsg
Actually my travel also not so bad,btohqsg
Just 3 days work per week,btohqsg
Haha I think ill just get A3 Cab itself bah,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt ya ya lah world kia,btohqsg
PARF of COE? I don‚Äôt see a lot of PARF one unless want to get the M sport one leh,btohqsg
I saw this but calculated A5 still cheaper leh  soft or hard too no diff to me,btohqsg
Higher repayment because left a few year leh,btohqsg
