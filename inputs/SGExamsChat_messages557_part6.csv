i fucking nutted when i saw it,btohqsg
the physics one was fun though,btohqsg
A least not electricity  lamina or the optical pins,btohqsg
so what y’all do for physics,btohqsg
boring = i feel like fucking dying,btohqsg
I get 26 points I damn happy alr,btohqsg
what the rod measurement for y’all,btohqsg
The L/M and F/N both must be constant?,btohqsg
mine were in intervals of 0.7 and 0.6,btohqsg
how rhe hell did you even manage a curve,btohqsg
L/M     F/N0.100 0.300.200 0.360.300 0.430.400 0.500.500 0.560.600 0.63,btohqsg
The error thing i also fked up,btohqsg
Is it micrometer or vernier caliper,btohqsg
Probably getting less than 10 for both papers,btohqsg
When I took my physics o levels…I forgot how a vernier works,btohqsg
What’s the comb sci bell curve ah,btohqsg
I rmb not knowing any of formulas for physics and just multiplying a bunch of numbers,btohqsg
Got a C6 still tho by sheer miracle,btohqsg
They clarified it earlier this year,btohqsg
So I need fall in 5% to get A2-1,btohqsg
The solution B & C I just copy tge table,btohqsg
Wait they say need write “no observable change” right,btohqsg
Half of it is me cancelling,btohqsg
I would be the happiest man alive if I get c6 & c5,btohqsg
But I never see then I go and write no visible change or reaction observed,btohqsg
Imagine taking a combined sci paper with no removal of common last topic  can’t be me,btohqsg
a mixture of solid and liquid,btohqsg
i tried to sleep after practical and slept 6 hours,btohqsg
lol esp since I nvr heard of him b4,btohqsg
hi uh is it okay if i kinda advertise myself here?as in  i make music and I need more listeners so if you guys could try my music out it would mean a lot to me,btohqsg
Do you stand to make a profit out of it is the real question lol,btohqsg
well  not really but ig if i screw up Os it'd come as a backup plan for earning income or smth like that,btohqsg
but currently i make my music for fun,btohqsg
i just released a new track today and it's kinda my experimentation of trying to make a LoFi track  so i just need some reviews on how it is so i can continue from there,btohqsg
used to make lofi when i started now i (unfortunately) make dubstep,btohqsg
i actually make electronic but im trying out lofi that's why,btohqsg
i meant like direct message me but ok,btohqsg
i never had a song called that,btohqsg
thats like my email from lower sec,btohqsg
if you have to ask  the answer is yes,btohqsg
rly thought this day wld never come,btohqsg
wait so like h1 vs h2 for like chem and bio,btohqsg
h2 u have prac and more topics isit,btohqsg
Alexandra Hospital (we no longer send patients there),btohqsg
yea but it’s not like if you take h3 then you don’t take h2. you do well in h2 in j1 then you can add on to also take h3,btohqsg
the content leans more to uni stuff but some subjects like physics or econs can take as a short course under ntu/nus instead of a moe syllabus,btohqsg
i take h3 then i drop my h2 to h1,btohqsg
so i take only h1 and h3,btohqsg
I’m curious do y’all send patients to IMH instantly,btohqsg
my area is too far from IMH but idts,btohqsg
