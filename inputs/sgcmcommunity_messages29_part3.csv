Just a small benefit on registration costs,btohqsg
So this might be a good deal right now  but once the rebates are pulled and full value ARF EVs start hitting the market. Resale value of the cars that have ARF rebates on them will really take a hit,btohqsg
u pay way lesser when buy new car  and when u sell currently the price so good haha,btohqsg
As those buying towards the end of term with 1 to 4 years left do take ARF rebate into consideration,btohqsg
and if got loan your intrest is lower also,btohqsg
Current market is not an indicator of the normal market as it is ridden by supply shortages and long delivery times and a much higher COE,btohqsg
and the arf is 505 back when scrap the more u pay the more u lose,btohqsg
the arf rebate very good to me liao,btohqsg
if car 145k become 100k only,btohqsg
so will tesla in future all add 45k?,btohqsg
this i read is still 2023,btohqsg
Agreed but all I'm saying is  if you look at the bigger picture of the whole 10 year tenure  ICE vs EV  your ARF rebates at the end will differ as well so the difference you're getting now can be pushed back to there,btohqsg
Just about when you want the rebate,btohqsg
but problem now is dealer pass u back the rebate anot haha,btohqsg
This one brand to brand ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Wearnes for example does not pass it down,btohqsg
I believe a few others pass down a significant chunk of it,btohqsg
yeah it is a very generous inititiave by goverment  but i see like i4 selling price,btohqsg
Because the paper ARF value is low,btohqsg
i see basic cost is 220k,btohqsg
But the dealer margins are high,btohqsg
selling price last i see is 320k?,btohqsg
Base 318is also at 50k ARF,btohqsg
I4 which is positioned at a higher class in the bmw lineup and is more expensive in general  paper ARF is around 30k,btohqsg
So they are using the rebate on paper,btohqsg
But added back into their margin,btohqsg
So you don't get the benefits of the rebate on purchase  nor do you get the higher ARF rebate on scrap,btohqsg
The 420i  the exact ICE counterpart of the I4 is at 60k ARF as well,btohqsg
Even though the I4 omv is 11k more than the ICE 420i,btohqsg
Just about dealers here and what they're doing  one has to really look into what they're buying,btohqsg
Most dealers will pass down at least the EEAI rebate of 20k as a discount or overtrade,btohqsg
But the 25k unlikely unless you're current car quite good then they can offer a very high overtrade,btohqsg
Tanjong Pagar car crash: The driver of the car was speeding at 148kmh on a 50kmh road and had alcohol in his system  revealed evidence given on the first day of a coroner's inquiry into the five deaths.Autopsy reports showed they all died of severe burns in the fire that engulfed the car and shophouse.https://cna.asia/3QahUOK,btohqsg
True   that why I love tesla,btohqsg
The D2C advantage really works there,btohqsg
But a dealer model is needed for some brands so manufacturers need to reshuffle their lineups and categorize into what can be sold D2C and what needs a dealer,btohqsg
"For example  in the cae with Mercedes  models like the GLS  S class  G-wagon  AMG variants have a lot of options for which a dealer and advisor is required to guide through the process and make the experience""exclusive and rewarding""",btohqsg
But regular a b c e and lower GL variants wouldn't,btohqsg
So a D2C model could be adapted there,btohqsg
Tesla D2C very easy  at max 4 cars  2 to 3 powertrain options,btohqsg
I think with time ba   tesla now is focusing on mass production,btohqsg
Alll these with help of technology is not that hard anymore,btohqsg
U see their model 3 and y good strategy mass production sales many many,btohqsg
Do so many ix3 ix1 and such kinda pointless in my opinion,btohqsg
Maybe that guy wanted buy ix3 but see ix1 cheaper go and buy ix1 then margin drop ownself caniibalize ownself,btohqsg
Not about the technology or mass production,btohqsg
More about the experience and guidance,btohqsg
When buying an S class or a Maybach or something even higher up like a Porsche  rolls  etc.,btohqsg
People want that experience of being able to individualize the car with an advisor who's with them throughout the process,btohqsg
Ya this I understand like I go branded shop,btohqsg
