but the next month if monthly average accidently drop to 99.99k  won't get 3% on the 99.99k right?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt feel so sad  actually it is not nothing  but 0.05% of $99.99k. That is about $4.xx. üòÄ,btohqsg
Hmmcrypto.comcard can‚Äôt top up with grab card anymore ?,btohqsg
What do u use to top up which doesn‚Äôt require you to pay a fee? Excluding debit cards and bank transfers,btohqsg
Any credit card topup tocrypto.comwill incur fees  no way around it. Anyway no card gives rewards forcrypto.comtopup so better to just use a debit card,btohqsg
The difference is that I can use a credit card to bridge the top up to grab card last time which doesn‚Äôt incur fees but enjoy payment via credit card  more for cash flow not rewards,btohqsg
Liddat only one I can think of is topup Mastercard credit card to amaze wallet  then tocrypto.com. But that route going to block off starting 5 July,btohqsg
Ah I see thanks üôè or can I use Revolut ?,btohqsg
Don't play play with Revolut's compliance. Once they find out u do this they'll suspend your account without warning,btohqsg
Oh I see topping up of wallets are a breach of compliance?,btohqsg
Any other comparable apps to xnap? Mostly to use for scanning at hawker and food courtsPlanning to use with Uob one card,btohqsg
Agreed unless he got amex issues card then use amex pay,btohqsg
One pax get get so muchüëç Which location ?,btohqsg
haha think have to be careful when using stash account. I am thinking of using it to park 100k just for one month as I need to empty my HSBC EGA on 1st July. 3% is better than Mari Bank and Trust.,btohqsg
Why not musical chair to UOB one 5% if you have monthly expenses more than $600 on Evol card ? Unless your UOB one is ‚Äúfull‚Äù?,btohqsg
hi guys is the HSBC 1% giro only available for those who have clock the ega+ requirement?,btohqsg
wah okay okay thanks thankslucky i clarify...,btohqsg
anyway just need a few minutes to transfer to meet requirements,btohqsg
yeah just some auto set up  but yeah good to go,btohqsg
oh already max out 100k in UOB one,btohqsg
1 July is a Saturday. Might mess out some of my computations if money transferred in are not immediately counted in for monthly average balance. Need to be careful. Reminder to all too that planning to move money around on 1 July too.,btohqsg
Use crypto com exchange instead of the main app. Cos the main app spread is insane,btohqsg
U know which bank will not be immediate on sat,btohqsg
I'm not sure whether it applies to all banks...,btohqsg
Teck whye. I see my rent higher than most condo. I lucky to meet my current tenant.,btohqsg
Saturdays are usually not an issue as long as you do it in the mornings.,btohqsg
will try to do at 12.15am,btohqsg
very brave. I would typically stop doing all banking activities between 11pm and 6am daily.,btohqsg
usually after 6am is fine. Unless is those scheduled maintenance where bank already tell you they finish at 9am.,btohqsg
Why need around 12am? I thought can do it anytime within the day? Or at least before 12pm?,btohqsg
sat might be considered not working day or half working day. so amount transferred in might not be counted towards the average monthly balance until next working day.,btohqsg
yah I guess before 12pm safer. think maybe do at 9.30am.,btohqsg
Is it possible to change the source of the payment from amaze if i charged my expenses already? For e.g from card to amaze wallet?,btohqsg
Can try ocbc 360 account too?,btohqsg
Any recommendations for redeeming grab rewards points? I'm looking at the 'up to 25% Pointsback' list..,btohqsg

hi anyone know if citibank cashback+ card can earn points for paying prudential insurance premiums? :),btohqsg
Hi HSBC EGA holders  any1 have received the 1% bonus interest / Cashback for month of May yet? Any idea when do the deposit this?,btohqsg
Dear gurus should I redeem my dbs points to offset my spend or keep them ?,btohqsg
Hi  does one earn miles (using Premiermiles) on via Atome?,btohqsg
"yes another 100k will go back to OCBC 365 account. I transferred them out to HSBC EGA in June to have a chance to ""reset"" back to 100k as have been increasing by $500 monthly beyond 100k.",btohqsg
is it worth to pair the HSBC travelone card with instarem amaze?,btohqsg
Depends on your use case? I pair it with Amaze as I intend to cash out all my miles on year end. Else.. better to pair with other cards if looking at general spend due to no expiry nature,btohqsg
Use HSBC Revolution for it  can earn 4mpd. Not sure about Citi PM tho,btohqsg
hmm but if you‚Äôre overseas  assuming you only have the travel one to use  would it be better to use instarem amaze (since it‚Äôs denominated in SGD  so 1.2mpd)  or use the card directly and pay the conversion fees (for 2.4mpd)?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if this fee is imposed on $ transferred out to grabpay/revolut? Primarily using 2000 instapoints to exchange for $20 and to transfer it out,btohqsg
Hi everyone  any idea how long the HSBC Revolution card takes to be delivered upon credit approval? Trying to time some purchases,btohqsg
Anyone knows whats the cheapest way to buy a macbook pro (M2)? Airport or education store?,btohqsg
