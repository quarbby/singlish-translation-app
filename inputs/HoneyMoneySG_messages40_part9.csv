one way is to deposit 500 on the 1st day of the month  and make sure no other deposit or withdrawal in that month. if salary come in  immediately transfer out the same amount. an easier way is to just use Excel to compute the amount to deposit/withdraw to make sure your average daily balance increase by 500 only,btohqsg

Yes. New to bank applies.But it will mean your SCB limit might be shared with your Trust Bank limit   which is highly likely  if your pay is 30 to 120k a year.Cos Trust Bank is using SCB bank license to issue credit cards. But still different bank. So for now use same income limit lor.,btohqsg
