Hi all  can I ask how does CPF determine if you will go for FRS or ERS at age 55? Assuming u have enough for ERS but want to just use the FRS sum.,btohqsg
By default they will shift your funds up to the prevailing FRS at 55  topping up to ERS is optional.,btohqsg
Does it make sense to keep the excessive $$ above FRS at 4% SA instead of ERS?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs up to personal preference. Excess monies staying in SA can be withdrawn out as cash at any point of time after 55 years old. If you choose to transfer into your RA  it cannot be withdrawn out  only meant for monthly payout.,btohqsg
Ok ok thanks for your advice,btohqsg
hi all  for uob prvi 45k miles promotion. i saw milelion mentioning that utilities is excluded but couldnt see this under the t&c. can anyone help to confirm?,btohqsg
FRS is by default  if you want to opt for ERS  you can just top up your RA up to the limit of ERS. Once u top up  it will not be withdrawabale. Only those in your OA and SA an be withdrawn anytime,btohqsg
Yup that‚Äôs what I said  if you transfer your SA/OA to your RA  it will not be withdrawable and only for monthly payout,btohqsg
sure. but what i had copied is specifically for the miles promotion though,btohqsg
Then you need to call UOB to clarify.,btohqsg

Found out that:1) there some users including myself that haven‚Äôt had this promo updated in-app. Workaround is to contact moomoo and they will manually register for u2) at the start  u must decide if u want the 5.8% 30-day coupon for the 10k or 50k deposit tranche. U will only get 1 coupon.If u aim for the 10k deposit 1st then over the promo period u accumulated $50k deposit  that won‚Äôt trigger a 2nd voucher.3) depositing is just the 1st part  for each tier  u need to make 5trades or 7 trades  respectively.,btohqsg

Am I going to sign up for SC smart credit card  who wants referral me?,btohqsg
Long story short. To get max benefits from moomoo promo  just deposit and subscribe in $2k four times and on fifth time deposit at least $2k up to either 30k or $80k.If the 1st four + fifth deposit is minimum $10k  then u will unlock the lower cap 30k  30-day 5.8% and your timer will start immediately.If the 1st four + fifth deposit is minimum $50k  then u will unlock the higher cap $80k  30-day 5.8% and your timer will start immediately.The 2 qualifying funds are:Fullerton SGD cash fundCSOP USD money market fund,btohqsg
Ayo what??? That's a nice hack thanks!,btohqsg
So your fifth deposit determines which coupon u will get. This is very important.And since 30 day count down will start immediately after u qualify  u need to keep and maintain the amount for the max.If let‚Äôs say u deposit in 10k today then your 30day timer starts  then say after 3 weeks u left with about 7 days and decide to subscribe 20k.Ah your 20k will get 5.8% but only for the last 7 day‚Äôs remaining of the timer.I very headache now coz MooMoo say it‚Äôs limited time and encourage me to sign up fast. But then  this month bonus month. So if sign up now  I can‚Äôt park my bonus to earn higher interest.I contemplating waiting till bonus is out the 1 shot do the strategy.,btohqsg

I've made an appeal for the full rebate given this is the 1st incident and it's hard for consumers to know what the merchant actually registered their biz as and i proposed to spend more the following month to make up the difference.

What do you mean? Assuming you're talking about paying with Trust card?,btohqsg
Nope as in if u are Union members normally u can tap with physical trust Union card at NTUC to earn point but if add the card on google pay and tap to add point It seem to be not able to detect,btohqsg
Google pay is to make contactless payment only,btohqsg
So still needs physical trust card to tap for Link point,btohqsg
I don't think you need to scan to earn points if you're using trust card already  since your linkpoints and trust card is linked. Correct me if I'm wrong.,btohqsg
Oh nope I pay via other card not trust,btohqsg
Bad. You using too much credit card. Hawker and food  courts is the way to save money,btohqsg
If you need the purchase to be clocked under contactless spending then you have to use your Trust/NTUC card to scan for linkpoints. If you're okay that it is clicked under online spending then download Fairprice app and set-up payment using the card you want. The Fairprice app will clock the linkpoints for you.,btohqsg

You can also use xnap which will link to your credit card to pay for hawker food if this option is available. Food courts like kopitiam and food republic can also pay with card. All these are eligible spending that will count towards min spend for most cards.Nothing wrong with spending $600+ a month if he/she can afford it  everyone have different needs. Don‚Äôt be so quick to pass judgement when we are all here to learn.,btohqsg
Wait till 1 year later tho,btohqsg
You can stay till the 50 years lease expires then return back to the Govt. If your dad leaves before 50 years lease up  Hdb will prorate the dollar value for the remaining years to you,btohqsg

Hi  i would like to share my little experience with ShopBack.If you use a fair share of food delivery service especially from Deliveroo  you get back up to 10% voucher discount or more. Tag your voucher purchase to any of your cashback CC  you earn cashback again. Which means you earn cashback from both sides.There are many direct vouchers saving from Shopback you can explore for saving which are so much higher from CC. Charging vouchers purchase to your cadhback CC  you earn 2nd round of cashback.,btohqsg
Maybe u can call their hotline or customer service for enquiries...,btohqsg
If you shop at Cold Storage and Giant  purchase Vouchers from ShopBack for 3% cashback... there are different voucher value to choose from $10  $20  $30 etc,btohqsg
What is the mcc code? Is it 6540?,btohqsg

Got to use Shopback in a smart way. For supermarkets   Cold Storage and Giant vouchers 3% cashback.Deliveroo vouchers can range from 5% to 10% on different value purchase or when there is a promo.At coffeshops  food courts or other mall merchants/restaurants  use it if you frequently visit them to get back your previous visit cashback amount. The App smartly tracks everything for you at your view.Mostly i prefer to purchase vouchers.Ppl who shop online with Shein  the vouchers discount is v high too.,btohqsg
Explore the App  you will find more on how best you can make use to save while spending... at the same time earning cashback from our CC.,btohqsg

Sorry I don't know. I normally wait for physical cards.. I am old school.,btohqsg
If u have the HSBC app  u can use the virtual card but need to activate it 1st.The issue that I had a dilemma on is that I was worried that my physical card get lost in transition then if I activate the card le and it‚Äôs lost  then there is a risk.So safer to wait for card to arrive then activateTo add:U can try add virtual card to online platforms but some platforms might allow u to add but when u try to pay  kena rejected coz not activated.Last time I added virtual HSBC revo to ShopBack  but when I tried to pay  rejected coz haven‚Äôt activated.Also  once u activate  it might take 1 day for these platforms to update also.,btohqsg
Any idea how to value it is 2.5% cashback? I check n it is about 1% only. Eg. Spend $100 n earn 400 points. Every 400 points can use it to pay $1 bill.,btohqsg
As long as any of the main NTUC outlets that got customer service to buy the vouchers from then can.Ie the aunty will ask u pay by what  then u say visa pay wave then once u pay  she go get the vouchers and pass to u. Then u can use the vouchers to manage your cash flow.I use this tactic to meet credit card promos but if u are not sure  best to buy $5 NTUC voucher 1st then wait for the transaction to be posted then call the bank and ask if the mcc code is valid and it‚Äôs a qualifying transaction. If yes  then u can buy more.,btohqsg
U spend $1000U get 1000 point end month  9000 point end of next month. Total 10k pointSince 400 points = $110 000 / 400 = $25Then$25 / $1000 x 100% = 2.5%Then if unlock HSBC Everyday+ Rewards programme  u get extra 1% cash rebate to your EGA account about 1-2 days after transaction posted.So effectively u get2.5% in points1% in cash rebate with EGA Everyday+ rewards programme,btohqsg
Miles and points different bro. HSBC points is 10 points per dollar. So $100 spend is 1000 points. This will  equal to $2.5.,btohqsg
And then can I use the ntuc vouchers through FairPrice app?Is there equivalent voucher in Cold Storage or giant since Uob one got additional cashback there,btohqsg
U go buy your NTUC groceriesAt payment the aunty ask u if u ntuc member  say yes n show her your NTUC FairPrice app (which u should have sign up before if not pls do it and set up the payment to UOB one credit card or whatever card u want to charge groceries to).Once she scan then she will ask u how u want to pay. U give her the vouchers. Then if got balance  u just say u pay by appShe will offset total cost minus the physical vouchers and the remaining charged to your card that u linked in FairPrice app,btohqsg
I think only NTUC sell physical vouchers. Other supermarkets don‚Äôt.They sell digital vouchers.I personally won‚Äôt want to risk buying digital vouchers coz some people say it won‚Äôt count as eligible spend on some other cards like DBS yuu card unless u mix some groceries spending with the voucher spending etc but idk if they closed this lobang already or not.Just stick with ntuc physical vouchers. Tried and proven method.If u want to sleep in peace  but $5 1st to test then call bank to check mcc code if valid transaction to count to quota.,btohqsg
HSBC revo is a points cardU can use points to redeem miles or Cashback or vouchers.Go login to HSBC webs page n see the vouchers there.Some of the vouchers there are worth more than u just simply redeeming the points for cash rebate to offset your bill.,btohqsg

U comparing apple to orange.HSBC Revo is a general spend card. So rewards slightly lower.SC Smart is specific spend card.Also the 6% might revert back to 5% once promo period over.

Hi anyone has any idea how the pro rated for new card holder for uob one credit card works. Let's say I miss the $500 spending for July(just received the card today) but able to spend $500 for Aug and Sep? Thanks,btohqsg
Your 1st month is prorated. Ie u don‚Äôt need to spend the full $500 on the 1st month. But u need to spend $500 min on qualified transactions on month 2 and 3 onwards.Tip is to call the bank to find out what your pro rates amount is. They will tell u and also share with u that u need to spend the pro rated amount for month 1 and 2 by the end of month 2.,btohqsg
My reply above.Your July pro rated amount u need to call bank to find out.Double confirm if u can spend the July prorated amount In august. They should tell u yes coz they also know that clients can sign up anytime n get their card end of month also.So they usually combine month 1 and 2 spending .,btohqsg
So for eg month 1 is 300 and month 2 is 700?,btohqsg
Your UOB ONE cycle is July  Aug  Sept. this is permanent and cannot change.Your $50 rebate for meeting this 3mth cycle will be credited end Oct (11:59:59pm) to offset the spending on Oct which u will have to pay on Nov.,btohqsg
U going for $500/mth quota right?,btohqsg
If i dont rmb wrongly‚Ä¶if you hit the min spend 2 out of 3 months your cashback will be prorated to 2/3 of it (ie 2/3*50 assuming you have no bonus cashback),btohqsg
So I can don't spend for Aug?,btohqsg
31 days in July -7 days = 24 days to hit pro rated July quota.500/mth / 31 x 24 days = about $387.I think u better call the bank just to be sure.My estimates is that u have to spend about $387 for July.Just confirm the amount that u need to spend for July and ask UOB if u need to spend this in July or can u spend this by end Aug.Ie July prorated amount + Aug $500,btohqsg

FYILast time ShopeePay voucher is the cheapest thing u can buy in Singapore$0.01 only.Now they removed that.

So the bank deems it as active.This is what I do on my UOB Absolute card. I clock $0.05 per month and can get waiver of annual fee lol(Maybe partly coz I also got UOB one and very guai spend on that? Who knows),btohqsg
I think saving the environment is nonsense for normal ppls. The rich ppl waste much more. I remember watching a news that says the private jets for the rich eject more pollution than our normal everyday life...,btohqsg
There‚Äôs ongoing debate on this plastic bag thing also.They don‚Äôt give plastic bag  then u have to buy. End of the day the cost about the same. Giant sells 100 small plastic bag for $4.50. Each $0.045. Ie about 5 cents also. Just that Supermarkets now earn side income.,btohqsg
Yes! they just want to make more money hahaha. They should sell bags made of cloth rather than sell plastic bags.,btohqsg
i bring my own disposable plastic bags,btohqsg
This plastic bag thing is akin to the courtesy chair on the mrtIt nudges people to be aware but impact very very low to the environmentIf let‚Äôs say ntuc publishes how much $ they collected from plastic bag sales; this just tells us a whole lot of people heck care the initiative.,btohqsg
Honestly kudos to those shop that provide plastic bag as needed but sell the extra requested. It's the actual take only what you need concept.End of the day  these disposal plastic bags are not single-use whereby people bring home their groceries and throw the plastic bag after they unpack. Especially Asian households  these plastic bags will definitely be reused whether to become trash bags or reused to carry other stuff.,btohqsg
That time I paid for the plastic bag and luck has it the aunty put my things in then made a hole.Then my scum bag mind told me to ask her for another one then my conscience kick in and told me to save the environment.I paid $0.05 for a broken plastic bag that day. Go home I patched up the plastic bag with masking tape coz too poor to afford another one to use as rubbish bag.,btohqsg
Value$ gives plastic bags and charges on extra ones!,btohqsg
Another thing is like why we need to take responsibility for saving environment. We lose poor life if the world come to end. But reach ppl will lose cozy life.,btohqsg
Exactly. A few are like that. But if you buying something small and brought a bag  if can reject the bag best reject... Honestly small bag can't fit much rubbish also. üôÉ,btohqsg
America should use electricity car since co many cars in USA causing global warming.,btohqsg
People online say for town council to be prepared people just throw things down Rubbish chute without plastic bag,btohqsg
If your own carrier bag too big then the thing u buy small  then u come into this situation where the bag has too much space lolLooks like u carrying a diaper.Might be good to carry different size bags.,btohqsg
A lot refuse to change from ICE car because they believe they can't go far with electric car. And also because they treat old cars like vintage... And not forgetting cars are cheap.,btohqsg
Everyone should but it‚Äôs still expensive to own one.Also the electricity to charge the car comes from mostly non-renewable sources,btohqsg
Actually electric car is not expensive  don‚Äôt focus on Tesla,btohqsg
Car = expensive regardless ICE car or electric car. But yeah got affordable electric cars like BYD  Nissan Leaf,btohqsg

Only get cards when there are sign up promos.For Sc smart  pls see their TnC online for list of merchants.For HSBC revo  their 9x points are given to a broad based list of merchants. Pls see TnC online for list.HSBC revo cannot use for bus/mrt. Some services like haricut at certain salons not counted for 9X as well. Things like utility bills also not counted I think.These 2 cards are good for newbies to credit cards.Once u can spend a minimum per month  u can consider other credit cards. Then the HSBC revo and SC smart can be backup.I think it‚Äôs better for u to focus on what u spend on and plan accordingly. It‚Äôs an art but once u figure out  it‚Äôs an amazing feeling.Then come back to this chat to ask specifics. Eg u list your cards then ask the community if certain spend is best to put on which card.Best not to ask community open ended question like how to spend.,btohqsg

NO. transactions billed in Jul that were incurred in Jun will not be considered under Q2 cashback.,btohqsg
I see. So those posted and billed in Jul is under Q3 already?,btohqsg
Yes  that‚Äôs correct. Transactions posted and billed in Jul will be considered under Q3 cashback.,btohqsg

Hey everyone  now that it costs 2% to cash out from Amaze into Grab  what are the best ways to cash out balances in Amaze wallet instead?I got a few hundred dollars in Amaze wallet from a merchant refund today.I note even spending from Amaze wallet no longer earns 4 x points currently.,btohqsg
I also got a refund to my wallet recently  but i just spent it lor,btohqsg
For MRT or Bus use base card  don't use Amaze (Similar to UOB KF),btohqsg
This one only limited to public transport?Or as long as pair with amaze card you won't get any reward,btohqsg
Don't think have any other way to cash out. Spend or absorb the transfer fee to grab before withdraw,btohqsg
Idea in TnC is basically this - if you pair to amaze and use for public transport (both conditions hit)  you won't earn anything,btohqsg
Use it to pay those transactions that do not earn rewards n in the exclusion list.,btohqsg
yeah i might just suck it up and pay the 2% fee to cash out with grab.logic being i will gain more using miles/cashback cards instead of forcefully using the Amaze wallet and only earn 1% cashback.mousehunter idea is also decent if I have transactions in exclusion list and yet accept card (so far can't really think of any common ones).,btohqsg

Hi all  just applied UOB EVOL card  wanted to check like my gym membership that is charge to the card does it consider online or others? also u see if u go to shopee website to shop is consider online but what if u use the shopee app does it consider online too? if shopee app is consider online  what if i use fairprice app which can tie to the card and use the app to make payment at kopitiam foodcourt or fairprice supermart would it consider online too? thanks in advance.,btohqsg
I just unbundled the EVOL card from FairPrice APP. Sometimes the salesperson may make the mistake of paying by APP.,btohqsg
The salesperson may think it doesn't matter. While we can get 8% from mobile contactless of $250 and 8% from online transactions of $250.,btohqsg
payment by app for fairprice was reported a few times to be deemed as physical payments too,btohqsg
mean first day of the month to the last day of the month right??,btohqsg
there's an issue on fairprice side where in-app would result as offline  someone posted a reply from CSO confirming that and they are fixing it (not sure if its already fixed)^i may have gotten some details wrong but thats the gist of it,btohqsg
May i know if online spending is qualify for the $350 cashback?,btohqsg
I spend on fairprice app  qoo10 and shopee. They told me that i am not qualify. üòÇ Can anyone advice on that? üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
I call in to check then i know i am not even qualify for the cashback. üò±,btohqsg

Thank you. Also can the citi rewards points and citi prestige point be combine together since it‚Äôs the same thank you point?,btohqsg
Never used Citi for the credit cards charging   only used it for the balance transfer programme,btohqsg
As in intention is to combine the points for miles redemption,btohqsg
No. Citi cards do not pool.  You need to pay separate miles conversion fee for different cards.,btohqsg
No particular reason- my first job was in UOB. Stuck with UOB and their miles cards are better than citi. I‚Äôm a mile chaser,btohqsg
Hi any recommendations for a credit card for any type of spending?,btohqsg
Citi has more transferring airline partners  eg. 9 and premiers miles has no expiry date.UOB only has 3 transferring airline partners. Miles usually expires in 2 years.,btohqsg
Lol sry I mean like general spending eg. Food  groceries  shipping,btohqsg
If u willing to manage different cards then many choices,btohqsg
Wat wld u recommend ? Tks,btohqsg
UOB airmiles card 1.4miles per dollar versus 1.2 for citi that‚Äôs why and don‚Äôt need to care about MCC. And uni$ used to Convert for SQ solely. Even so now with the combined power (with spouse) of the uob lady‚Äôs card it‚Äôs 4 categories  easier to cover most of our frequent spendings,btohqsg
Got a question on the Amaze card. Still new to using it.When I use the Amaze card  it shows the converted foreign currency in SGD inside the app. Eg spent 30 MYR = 8.72 SGD . Is there any other hidden fees (like the FX fee) charged later?,btohqsg
No hidden fee charged later. I used it for some time already,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGwhen is the best time to transfer cpf oa to sa? month end or?,btohqsg
Hi any recommendations for a credit card for any type of spending?,btohqsg
Yes it is  pair with ega even better,btohqsg
If you are still in contact with UOB  can help to suggest to UOB to enhance the apps for mile conversion. When user want to convert miles  users can enter their air miles membership number together with the miles conversion request? That will shorten the conversion time required.Currently  UOB requires user to submit airline membership number first  it take as long as 2 -3 weeks to update the membership number. Only after it is updated  then user can submit conversion request.Btw I have submitted my airline membership number 3 weeks ago  still no news as of today.,btohqsg
Can share how to submit the membership number?,btohqsg
Hi guys is it worth the hassle to invest OA into tbill?  Think if we use 100k  2.5% vs 3.88%(example)  the difference is abt $300?,btohqsg
Go to UOB Apps -> Rewards+ -> Redeem UNI$ -> Travel. Choose the airline you want to convert  Then click ‚Äúterm n condition‚Äù.,btohqsg
Found it  and thanks for the heads up for 2-3 weeks,btohqsg
Have anyone try this? Say 2 percent cap at 10k spend per month,btohqsg

Mine is still no news or they will secretly update on backend without informing me? Nobody know. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èMy suggestion to you is submit both Kris and Asia miles membership number now even if you don‚Äôt need it at the moment.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm just starting Uob miles with lady solitaire  but thanks for the info,btohqsg
Why sia. What‚Äôs the number to call?,btohqsg
I just check I applied yuu in apr. Now jul. Izit still haven‚Äôt payout?,btohqsg
Just call in and check bro. They able to advice you. Maybe you not even qualify and you not aware?,btohqsg
Pls stated your spending habit  monthly spend  spend on what etc before any one can advice. There is ton of card out there. Plus are u a cashback or miles person,btohqsg
Can anyone share with me regards to the minimum spending.,btohqsg
Payment to fairprice by app  shopee and qoo10 are not qualify.,btohqsg
Many tks! Food  public transport  groceries  toiletries,btohqsg
Cashback more ... miles I dunno hw to utilize,btohqsg
If monthly 2-3 k for cashback can consider hsbc advance if u want simple if u want more then need to spilt spending into more card,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs just put it this way  the bank is big with many departments. They won‚Äôt entertain request like that even if it‚Äôs from an internal staff. Maybe I should learn more in@ChrisHMSGand folks‚Äô journey then be qualified to manage the credit cards rewards team and ease off the pain we all feelWith all the banks‚Äô reward systems . These policy maker folks are totally disconnected with the ground,btohqsg
think this request will get lower priority since it does not bring them more income,btohqsg

Anyone knows if this moomoo promo  will it be counted if withdraw existing funds and deposit back ?,btohqsg
Calendar month. The T&Cs states the what and how quite clearly,btohqsg
MooMoo replied me on this. Cannot.If u already have $ in funds when the promo is launched  that is considered as your net asset. If u withdraw $x and put back $x  your net asset value increase is $0.U need to pump in fresh $10k and do 5 fund. trades. Only the $ above your net asset earns 5.8%.Eg if u have $20k in fund when the promo was launched. If u withdraw $10k n deposit back $10k  your net asset still is $20k. U won‚Äôt get 5.8% tier 1 coupon.ButIf u leave the $20k and then deposit in $10k  your net asset increased 10k. Then the 20k will not qualify for the 5.8% and continue to earn the prevailing interest rate  but the $10k that u topped up will enjoy 5.8%.For me I am in this second category. So I will skip this promo. Sad.I think this promo is good for those who don‚Äôt have any funds in MooMoo in the 1st place.Knowing this  I think next time if I want to buy Fullerton cash fund  I would just buy it in WeBull. Their their withdrawal is T+1 unlike MooMoo/Tiger. They also hardly have any promo for funds. But moomoo is very aggressive in promos. So my strategy is next time moomoo got promo  I go in  participate  get out. I don‚Äôt want to make same mistake twice leaving $ in there and then these can‚Äôt count toward current promo.,btohqsg
Wow thanks so much for this. And yeah good idea to just withdraw from Moomoo and use webull in the future,btohqsg
Yes this card give up to 3.5 percent if u spend more then 2k for the month if u have bank acct with the.,btohqsg
mooMoo getting smarter.They know we redeem n resubscribeOr redeem > withdraw > redeposit > resubscribe. Think they want fresh funds.,btohqsg

Thanks for sharing. This means that even if a person has existing funds in cash plus  they will also qualify for this national day promo as well as they deposit $10k in fresh funds? And the $10k will get a guaranteed 5.8% for one month? Do you know how long much we keep the $10k in cash plus? Thanks,btohqsg

Hi guys  what‚Äôs the best card to make online purchases for USD?,btohqsg
anyone knows if I used UOB EVOL to top up YouTrip does it counted as part of the 500 for UOB one account and does it consider online transaction as part of cash back ?,btohqsg
If u have existing funs  then those will just get the prevailing interest rate.If u top up $10k and do 5 trades into Fullerton cash fund for example  then the existing cash will just earn the usual 3.8-4%  while your topped up amount of $10k will get the guaranteed 5.8%.If u don‚Äôt have any other means to earn higher interest and u have excess cash above what u already have in Fullerton cash fund  then by all means go ahead.,btohqsg
Can buy 10k x 5 times all on the same day?,btohqsg
U can explore InstaRem combined with MasterCard  Trust bank card  YouTrip/ or other multi currency cards. Or any other card that give u more than 3.25% rebate since if u charge USD to an SGD domiciled card  u will be charged at least 3.25% dynamic conversion fee. So u just need to find any card that gives u more than 3.25% then at least u will break even or profit.,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Will explore the options. I dont have that much existing cash in moo moo cash plus currently.,btohqsg
Should be. Scroll up and read the other replies to ascertain from other people‚Äôs feedback as well.In doubt  pls call MooMoo to ask,btohqsg
For me  I won‚Äôt take part in this moomoo 5.8% promo since withdrawing n redepositing doesn‚Äôt count.I will withdraw and park in HSBC EGA since I‚Äôm getting 4.3% + 1%.Then pray floor pray sky that moomoo has another promo that I can then participate again.,btohqsg
Ok I see  I will sure that there will be opportunities üòä,btohqsg
moomoo is the most active vs tiger or webull. if i were u  and u like fullerton cash fund; may i suggest to park in webull instead. Their withdrawal is T+1 only and they dont have much promotions for funds. So as moomoo comes up with another promo again  can withdraw from webull and participate in moomoo.then once done  withdraw and park back in webull and wait for next moomoo promo.,btohqsg
When u withdraw  1 business day later u get ur money,btohqsg
Oh I see. That is a good idea too. Will check out webull. So far  mostly using srs funds to purchase fullerton cash fund from money owl  but not buying too much too.,btohqsg
Hi  I m new to here‚Ä¶May I ask what is the effective way to pay the following?Is it HSBC everyday card or via giro (paper type  or egiro ok via HSBC e-giro)1. MCST 2. Road Tax3. Car InsuranceThanks in advance üòá,btohqsg
Moomoo & Tiger: T+2WeBull: T+1T = trading dayT + 1 means it takes 1 trading day to for the units to be settled and fund withdrawable back to bank.EgMoomoo if redeem Fullerton cash fund Monday 8am  u can only withdraw Tue evening earliest or Wed. Monday being 1st trading day and Tue being 2nd trading day.For WeBull  if u redeem Monday 8am  sometimes by end of Monday same day u can withdraw or by Tuesday morning next day can withdraw.This so important because your money in transit does not earn interest. So if it takes t+2  u lose 2 days where your cash could have earned interest.,btohqsg
The cash fund in webull is moneybull? Thanks,btohqsg
How u sign up giro doesn‚Äôt matter. Some services like HDB can signup eGiro where they use SingPass. Some like IRAS don‚Äôt have eGiro n u have to fill up their paper form.ImportantMost people who open HSBC bank account will open HSBC EGA. If u satisfy the everyday rewards + programme  u get 1% rebate on giro  available balance and credit card spend.So pay all GIRO bills by EGA is possible unless u have other strategies like credit card + CardUp.If u open EGA online  the bank does not have your physical signature and u need to visit the branch to provide.This happened to me coz HSBC called me up say they decline my paper GIRO application from IRAS as they cannot verify my signature on the IRAS form.,btohqsg
To addI pay by giro the followingIncome taxHDB mortgage cash top upInsuranceHDB Conservancy feesProperty taxAll of which I get back 1% about 2 working days after giro is settled and posted in my EGA.I am sure other bills by Giro will also get u 1%,btohqsg
Hi Zan  thanks for the reply.May I ask if I charge insurance and Hdb conservancy fees to HSBC credit card vs EGA GIRO ~ do I still get the 1% rebate? Thanks,btohqsg
NO!!!Don‚Äôt do thatThese are excluded categories in TnCIt won‚Äôt be counted towards any credit card point  rebates  etcDon‚Äôt do it,btohqsg
What's so good about the UOB lady credit card ?? The spending is only on specific categories. E.g  you can't get cashback on spending online such as laptops from DELL  Apple  and Lenovo.,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt buy laptops every month  but you eat every month. So for the dining - it‚Äôs a sweet deal for a mile chaser,btohqsg
if i make income tax payment via ipaymy but the amount does not fully cover the amount for a monthly instalment payment  will iras deduct the balance for the month or deduct the monthly amt?,btohqsg
In credit card world  there are cards for general spending and specialised spendingGeneral spending cards give u lower returns.Specialised credit cards give u higher returns.UOB Ladies card now gives u up to 6 miles per dollar during the promo period  it will go back to 4 miles per dollar after. So make hay when the Sun still shines and take advantage.UOB ladies card is a master card. Can combine with InstaRem .If u go overseas  InstaRem converts overseas spending to SGD. There by avoiding the 3.25% dynamic conversion fee on the card. U get 1% insta points + 6miles/dollaron your overseas travel.But if u don‚Äôt travel then this card is the highest miles card for now. If u collecting miles.Besides  u can combine with Kris+ app to increase your miles point and also take part in Kris + MasterCard challenge.If u can do all these   u Jedi-level card user already.,btohqsg
I understand now. So excluded categories (not eligible) spend under credit card will not earn the 1% spend.I thought it‚Äôs total amount spend on the credit card despite no HSBC points for those insurance amount. Thanks,btohqsg
Correct.Non eligible categories avoid spending on credit card. Don‚Äôt make the same mistakes others before u had made.,btohqsg
I need to switch out insurance premium from HSBC CC to EGA GIRO in order to earn the 1% rebate. Thanks so much Zan,btohqsg
The only credit card that allows for insurance premiums payment areMaybank platinum visa 3.33%UOB Absolute 1.7%Other AMEX cards.But depends if u can even pay with AMex.Otherwise u can use UOB Absolute to top up GrabPay MasterCard to get 0.3% then use GrabPay master card to pay the insurance and get no rewards. If u are that desperate to earn 0.3% that is. U can do this while waiting for your GIRO to be approved. But too much hassle imho,btohqsg
Same.. Called UOB and to wait few more days..,btohqsg
Any gurus here know how to earn rebates on VCMA ie voluntary contribution to MediSave ?Coz now I see only can pay using Paynow.Not more by credit cards.,btohqsg
If I add amaze with link to Citi rewards still earn 4mpd right ? Or it has to add Citi rewards card only ?,btohqsg
amaze accepts several master cards. Just make sure u default the payment to the chosen MasterCard.If u added Citi Rewards to amaze  then yes  u will earn the 4mpd up to $1k spend. This 1k is not a amaze limit but the Citi rewards 4mpd eligible spending/ month limit.,btohqsg
So like for grab etc can link amze directly also to be ease ofMind when to link which for Citi rewards 4mpd,btohqsg
I use it for their debit card,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt so I can‚Äôt advise. But I will need to sign up FSMone in the future to do the CPF shielding hack for my special account and buy into the Nikko AM Shenton bond fund.,btohqsg
First time I hear FSM1 have card,btohqsg
GrabPay MasterCard I think cannot add to amaze if I not wrong.It‚Äôs a prepaid credit card not the usual credit card,btohqsg
Ooo  I mean amaze credit card for grab rides payment,btohqsg
1% cashback on all purchases except blacklisted categoriesCan also use for SimplyGo,btohqsg
I seeU want to stack amaze rewards?But the amaze 1% on overseas spend only right?But no harm la. U can just use Amaze linked to Citi rewards locally or overseas. Overseas got extra InstaRem 1%.But make sure to meet Min spending quota for Citi rewards ya,btohqsg
simplyGo the best cashback is the SC smart credit card giving you 6‚ÑÖ without minimum spending  if I am correct,btohqsg
Eh?U only getting 1%But most credit cards give a lot more.Why u using debit card ?,btohqsg
Ya  just like some need amaze for 4mpd and some not so wondering if can just link for all expenses then no need to think when use just know except travel only . There min spending for Citi rewards ?,btohqsg
U are half rightFor SimplyGoBest card is DBS live fresh 5% + 5% eco rewards = 10%Next is UOB ONE3.33% base + 5% for SimplyGo = 8.33% for($500/$1000 per month quota).3.33% base + 6.67% = 10% for($2k/mth quota)Next is SC Smart6% for simply Go coz promo periodNext yr 1 Jan 2024 will go back to 5%  unless they extend.,btohqsg
Wait  I forgot about UOB EVOL 6.67% for SimplyGo alsoBut the is one need to be mobile contactlessIf take out card n tap won‚Äôt get rewards. Need to pay thro phone,btohqsg
Will still get rewards  only 0.3% cashback,btohqsg
Don't earn enough to qualify for credit cards,btohqsg
I see.I can‚Äôt advise on debit cards since I haven‚Äôt done research which ones give the best rebates.,btohqsg
UOB evol gives 0.03% on SimplyGo?,btohqsg
Sorry my bad. UOB Evol on SimplyGo will get 6.67% when pay by mobile contactless. My 0.3% is referring to SimplyGo using the card itself,btohqsg
is okay  thanks for your help anyways,btohqsg
Oh yaThat sucks. My friend kena before this 0.3%. Once bitten twice shy.He never bring the card out anymore.,btohqsg
If the GMPC was topped up from a credit card  you cannot use that balance to pay for insurance anymore,btohqsg
Anyone know if I get any miles if I top up YouTrip card with Citi Premiermiles card?,btohqsg
I think cannot since this is considered prepaid wallet.,btohqsg
I see. Thanks a lot. üí™üèª,btohqsg
Any top ups to anywhere generally do not have rewards...,btohqsg
The rate seems better than moomoo?,btohqsg
Intraday rounding error.Fullerton cash fund is the same across all the brokerages. Check the ticker symbol.Tiger usually updates their rates quiet fast  then I notice moomoo and WeBull follow.,btohqsg
Not true  just not thought axs  if direct on insurer web still can,btohqsg
Yes like I already said simplyGo the best cashback is the SC smart credit card giving you 6‚ÑÖwithout minimum spendingThe other 3 cards you mentioned need to meet minimum spending which our transportation spending is probably less than $100 per month,btohqsg
https://help.grab.com/passenger/en-sg/360038784491-Why-can%E2%80%99t-I-use-my-GrabPay-Card-at-some-merchantsI suppose someone has to take the risk and try it out ('selected insurance providers'). Then again  one could always contact Grab support to transfer the top up back to your bank account if the insurance payment doesn't work.,btohqsg
Why are you still using Grab? They are trash now!,btohqsg

Yes  as long as nth is withdrawn from the a/c,btohqsg
Hi All  Sorry for the weird question i very blur because there's a lot of CCWhat Credit card do you recommend for  Transport & Buying stuffs online? Like shopee/Tiktok  etc. Also its good if there's installment payment too.,btohqsg
Some card requires you to spend minimum $600 per month or consecutive $500 per month for three months. Then can give you benefits.,btohqsg
Actually my singtel bills and stuff can add up to 500+ every month already,btohqsg
I am mainly using UOB EVOL.https://youtu.be/2j2G936wpJI,btohqsg
8% is not effective rate. Effective rate is 6.667% because only first $250 from mobile n first $250 from online earn 8%. The rest of $100 earns 0.3% only. Average is 6.667% from minimum $600 spending.,btohqsg
Not sure what 'instalment payment' you're referring to...Most retailers will offer credit card interest free IPP for your purchases  above a total certain amt...,btohqsg
Oh  then minus that what would u recommend?,btohqsg
I'm using amaze+CRMC for online purchases...  including foreign currency purchases...Transport is not a big portion of my expenses  so I'll use whatever is convenient for me....,btohqsg
