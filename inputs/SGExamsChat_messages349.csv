Hello anyone here know can do customised PC esp for gaming?,btohqsg
Tho I only build at my workshop,btohqsg
Is rtx 580 good enough for gta and elden ring and warzone,btohqsg
My pc keeps lagging or crashing,btohqsg
yeah thats what people tell me,btohqsg
Minimum for GTA best performance is 16Gb,btohqsg
Wah ram is 200 dollars sia,btohqsg
More ram = fast speed = less lag,btohqsg
can use two different brand stickd,btohqsg
wow so I could have used a cheaper ram,btohqsg
But 3080 is a good graphic,btohqsg
Can I upgrade pc If I come over to your workshop,btohqsg
I was 15 then so I went simlim and bought the pc for 1.2k,btohqsg
"The newly announced 4080 and ""4080""",btohqsg
3070 team stick to your 3070s,btohqsg
I might be considering 3080 soon,btohqsg
then make a deeper hole in ur wallet,btohqsg
But ya the 4000 series power draw horrendous,btohqsg
is 4080 similar to 3090 in size,btohqsg
Zotac's design look like menses pad,btohqsg
Bro the 4080 is 6 times faster,btohqsg
But why spend that much tho,btohqsg
I've heard the 4080 is about 2x faster than a 3080  but if you buy 2 3080s it costs more than 1 4080,btohqsg
They using this to justify the price,btohqsg
I gor scammed at sim lim,btohqsg
Coz trend is high end cards is usually never 4 digit usd,btohqsg
At this point maybe touching grass is the correct thing to do?,btohqsg
it was a few years ago,btohqsg
Quite long ago but I only bought hdd from simlim just coz the pricing not much difference  and I got someone there to help assemble my pc,btohqsg
So just buy and bring over,btohqsg
my dad ask me check seal,btohqsg
All these simlim chop carrot head one,btohqsg
Broken seal means considered used already,btohqsg
bruh i was fking dumb at 15,btohqsg
Now you know don't buy from them,btohqsg
There was 50 percent discount somemore,btohqsg
Or when you check the discount very little,btohqsg
They say 20 percent off mega sale,btohqsg
Actually that one useful if you buy electronics,btohqsg
the way theres so many scammers joining this grp,btohqsg
what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object,btohqsg
The energy  due to the collision  would be super high and unlimited as the unstoppable force would keep pushing and the unmovable object woundn't move so basically it will be an unlimited source of energy,btohqsg
Which is heavier. 1kg of steel or 1kg of feathers with the same number of atoms.,btohqsg
same mass right so neither is heavier?,btohqsg
wait how does that work 😂,btohqsg
so what’s the answer to that question,btohqsg
The strongest spear Vs the strongest shield who win,btohqsg
can’t come to a conclusion right,btohqsg
yeaaa i get what you mean,btohqsg
Obscene messages being sent from what appears to be a NY Poly lecturer. Does anyone have NY Poly contact info,btohqsg
Ya maybe but his meetup point is also Nim Gardens by NY Poly,btohqsg
Anyways it's very obscene and homophobic  would like NY Poly to sort it out if someone has contact,btohqsg
Can u pm me more details I'm in NYP,btohqsg
That ‘s so unprofessional for someone using his real name on a Carou profile that matches the one on LinkedIn.,btohqsg
Why you ask how much haha,btohqsg
Oh yeah why did u join this group,btohqsg
Is it solely for complaining about this or...,btohqsg
Not sure if he's angmoh or local Eurasian,btohqsg
I doubt ang moh uses carousel?,btohqsg
Do u mind if I ask you smth thru PM? (Nothing sketchy).,btohqsg

Hi guys   for NUS life sciences what gpa wld stand a good chance to be able to enter,btohqsg
u need to apply to college of humanities and sciences cos admissions is to the whole college  of which life science is just one of the majors,btohqsg
can look up nus' igp but im not sure if the stats for this year's admissions cycle are available yet,btohqsg
Hi guys! This meme is really funny,btohqsg
Gwen why are you so rude!,btohqsg
i took selfie with egg sheeran today,btohqsg
Stop stealing what I'm best at,btohqsg
Hey guys just wanted to ask,btohqsg
How important is a uni degree for financial comfort in Singapore,btohqsg
Neither of my parents have a uni degree but they earn enough to live comfortably in a 4 room flat with 2 children,btohqsg
Is that hour idea of financial comfort?,btohqsg
not enough  u need uni degree from harvard  mit  stanford  cambridge  oxford  as well as masters and phd from all the schools mentioned above,btohqsg
on top of that  u need to be the owner of Apple  Meta  Alphabet  Tesla  Microsoft,btohqsg
dabbling in the stock market is not a must  but its highly recommended... your annual returns should be at least 10 000% in order to outpace inflation,btohqsg
other than that  u just need to work 25h a day  8 days a week,btohqsg
should be relatively easy to accomplish :),btohqsg
Labour Productivity increases thus increasing SRAS which shifts the SRAS curve downwards,btohqsg
Depends on what is considered comfortable for you and also sector coz not all require degree to progress. My colleague is a dip holder and got 4rm with a newborn daughter. Her hubby also working.,btohqsg
I think as long as you don't splurge on an expensive house or car u shud be fine,btohqsg
Just get a normal house and normal car,btohqsg
last time different. Both my parents stopped education at O lvl and survived on single income all the while.,btohqsg
There are too many factors. Some Grab riders are earning between 6k to 8k monthly,btohqsg
There's alot of debate on how much money to lead a comfortable life,btohqsg
So I would assume that comfortable life means that1. No need to worry about food2. No need to worry about water or gas or electricity.3. If u stop working  you can survive for at least a month or two?,btohqsg
Obviously if u think that buying a 2k jewelry every month is comfortable then prob u need higher income,btohqsg
But for the average household basic needs are enough,btohqsg
3 is debatable. Two months would be quite uncomfortable.,btohqsg
I seen some people survive for a few years,btohqsg
6 months to a year at least for me,btohqsg
think many in SG can. Depends on lifestyle.if spend $1k a month  $24k can survive 2 years,btohqsg
Then u have to take into account children?,btohqsg
my household expenditure with kids is like >$6k monthly,btohqsg
I mean if u get rid of tuition assuming he is independent.,btohqsg
Then again children's baby formula is expensive,btohqsg
But that's if u get the expensive brand,btohqsg
when I was on my own living with parents  I spend <$900 on most months,btohqsg
If u were to breast feed the baby and let's say purchase cheap baby formula.,btohqsg
I think u would be able to survive on very little money,btohqsg
so want to save  do it before marriage 😂,btohqsg
Imo if u are weighing the price of formulas its probs not financially comfortable alr,btohqsg
Children are an investment of their own,btohqsg
They can generate income for u next time,btohqsg
baby formula  while expensive  isn't the biggest cost,btohqsg
Actually maybe their diapers? Their healthcare?,btohqsg
nah. If they don't need me to continue to provide for them when they grow up  that's sufficient for me,btohqsg
When I was a child I got sick all the time,btohqsg
Diapers are like average 40 cents per piece  cheaper when younger and more expensive when older,btohqsg
Unless u were to have a baby born magically with a strong immune system,btohqsg
milk powder about $60+ for a large tin  finish in about a month,btohqsg
if u were to calculate  average 5 diapers a day  it is probably $120 monthly for a kid,btohqsg
so milk powder and diapers are not the main costs,btohqsg
But then healthcare it is subsidised by the govt? And also insurance?,btohqsg
So roughly how much? Do u know?,btohqsg
eg kenna hfmd  and hospitalised. That would be $5k for a week stay,btohqsg
cuz of that  need get insurance. Hospital + accident plan almost $1+k annually,btohqsg
I got life insurance for my kids  pay for 5 years upfront. That's $4+ k annually,btohqsg
I seen some parents opt out of child care?,btohqsg
most expensive. Before subsidy  cheapest near to $800 monthly,btohqsg
U need to educate me more man,btohqsg
Assuming you only let him go kindergarten only so no childcare. I think that can save a bit of money,btohqsg
depends on income  low income can bring down to $200+ monthly,btohqsg
Trust me  go later  learn later  bring more problems in the future,btohqsg
I think good range is anyth 5k and above/parent,btohqsg
it's not about learning content  it's about peer interaction,btohqsg
The fact that we basically created needs for ourselves is funny.A couple of decades ago  going to childcare would be unheard of.,btohqsg
For me a comfortable income is the complete ability to afford necessities at a certain quality while being able to afford small luxuries such as holiday,btohqsg
Then again it's funny that people in the past have better social skills than the generation now right?,btohqsg
those are the basic expenses only,btohqsg
that time sg hasn't developed it,btohqsg
it was because the focus was developing p sch,btohqsg
last time all the p sch have morning and afternoon sessions,btohqsg
Like when only the rich send their kids there,btohqsg
Now we are facing aging population,btohqsg
and last time dual income was not popular,btohqsg
We are working more on average? To enjoy the same amount of time on average?,btohqsg
my parents time  5 rm bto was 80k,btohqsg
Wish we could turn back time,btohqsg
Tbh rn we enjoy alot of shit older gen dont get,btohqsg
turn back time can  go Malaysia 🙈,btohqsg
Sure we enjoy them... But .... Their causing us problems on another level?,btohqsg
Each gen has each gens issues,btohqsg
Like u guys may say we have the internet and stuff.,btohqsg
Every generation hv their own problems to solve,btohqsg
But... It's like the internet is causing alot of problems for us? So pros and cons,btohqsg
old uncle here says every generation has their own opportunities.,btohqsg
The funny thing is that it's impossible to solve all of them. So the best we can do is to make do,btohqsg
Not old uncle but i agree,btohqsg
U shldnt put urself in the position to solve all our generations issues,btohqsg
Solve a problem  ie create gaming chairs  u can buy GCB,btohqsg
All u need to ensure is that u secure a good life for urself,btohqsg
But rather solve it on an individual level,btohqsg
Like example... U go into your life realising you have anxiety when calling because you mostly text and you are introverted?,btohqsg
Then u solve it by putting ur phone away more and talking to more people,btohqsg
honestly when you are younger  savings will definitely be lesser and all these come to mind,btohqsg
Everyone sooner or later shld get an aha moment,btohqsg
But also sometimes there's something called influence. Solving it individually may spark influence,btohqsg
when you worked like 10 years  and have been prudent  these stuff are not going to matter much,btohqsg
Where they see the way forward,btohqsg
Then aft that u will see life fall into place slowly as long as u are acting on it,btohqsg
Usually for guys its during NS ahahaha,btohqsg
Thats y I honestly thank god for 2 yrs,btohqsg
I managed to sort my shit out,btohqsg
Like what do u like about it,btohqsg
And figure out what i want in life,btohqsg
2 years of time to think,btohqsg
I still communicate with them on WhatsApp group chat,btohqsg
That's something u like about NS isn't it,btohqsg
I was in q a elitist bubble ah,btohqsg
my NS was 2002 to 2004,btohqsg
I say I old uncle liao mah,btohqsg
2004  1 month after I ORD  NS changed to 2 years,btohqsg
Its always good to meet ppl frm different circles,btohqsg
At least NS prob changed their mind of the world ahead of them,btohqsg
Not like ur sch shows how smart you are,btohqsg
I mean like as long as u are educated and respectful that's more than enuff.,btohqsg
If u say they are snobby people then that's another problem,btohqsg
like I always tell my students  the main difference is good students are much more hardworking and disciplined.,btohqsg
I ever seen students said they studied very hard for exams  and their definition of study hard was they studied overnight,btohqsg
To be fair that's probably studying very hard for em,btohqsg
ya and because of that they expected A1,btohqsg
That's impossible unless they are ayanokouji,btohqsg
It's called working hard because it's done over a long period of time,btohqsg
so we have to be smart,btohqsg
It's like in the past  everyone consumes content through television and maybe radio and newspapers???,btohqsg
Nowadays there is so many options,btohqsg
like I tell my students  I do maths on the 1+ hr bus ride home everyday.1h bus ride × 5 days a week × 40 weeks × 2 years = 400 extra hours of work.if spend time on smart phone  that's 400 hours on phone,btohqsg
And the thing about smartphone is that we get to choose what to watch?,btohqsg
I mean if u take away holidays prob will be lesser,btohqsg
Just need to learn to pick and choose,btohqsg
Last time is need to know how to find,btohqsg
Like let's say currently I'm a boxing fanatic,btohqsg
Now is need to know what to find,btohqsg
I watch vids of boxing on my phone,btohqsg
Knowing what to Google is a skill in itself 😂,btohqsg
But because of this I don't watch news or maybe don't search up other stuff it's a waste?,btohqsg
If I use my phone for a long time,btohqsg
Nowadays I also lazy to study,btohqsg
U dun need to study everyday but u need to learn,btohqsg
Phones and internet by extension is as much of a blessing as it is a curse,btohqsg
I try to learn smth everyday,btohqsg
The feeling of progress is addicting,btohqsg
like now I'm in hospital accompanying my dad for medical checkup. I could be reading a book but I'm too lazy to do so,btohqsg
Even chatting here you are learning something,btohqsg
Woke up 7am tday to do accounting,btohqsg
I believe to not feel dead u must have something to look forward to,btohqsg
when u have kids  it becomes a 24h job,btohqsg
coz everyday is dead day in uni 😄,btohqsg
I thought yr 1 gnna be,btohqsg
Uni is what u make of it ah,btohqsg
Its wether if thts the life for u,btohqsg
Never partied in my life and never will haha. But I tot uni is for studying,btohqsg
Like what's the point of parties tho...,btohqsg
Do u get any dopamine rush during a party?,btohqsg
The connections u make in uni,btohqsg
That's good. I learn something new,btohqsg
Tho I would prob attend like once every month considering studying is hard,btohqsg
In uni everything is abt frens u make,btohqsg
Frm staying hall to future internship/job opp,btohqsg
reality: getting rekt by bellcurve everyday,btohqsg
You know like jc life very boring,btohqsg
Idk everyone studying all the time,btohqsg
and rush home after school end,btohqsg
I thought all jc like that one,btohqsg
Eh depends on the crowd u with,btohqsg
I hope uni got more balance,btohqsg
It rly is what u make of it ah,btohqsg
Do what u want but u j tahan the consequences lor,btohqsg
If u study too hard kenna no frens,btohqsg
If u party too hard say hi to ur 3.0 gpa,btohqsg
Do people stick to their cliques,btohqsg
My friends all were not the super extroverted so. Idk sia,btohqsg
I wanna meet people who are willing to go out and stuff,btohqsg
U go biz everyone party animal,btohqsg
U go cs everyone wont look u in the eye,btohqsg
Not the place to hv fun,btohqsg
Ntu as long as u hv a pulse can alr,btohqsg
most friends u make will end up being hi bye friends only,btohqsg
Depends what u count as fun,btohqsg
I want to create a discord for the entire sg server,btohqsg
So that people can go to their hobby,btohqsg
and find people with similar interests and games,btohqsg
There seems to be alot of people being sad and lonely on sg reddit,btohqsg
Reddit not good for mental health fr,btohqsg
If u hv no one to turn to other than strangers on reddit,btohqsg
if ur headed to nus  can consider rc!,btohqsg
I think its for those 30 yo,btohqsg
i stay in rc  honestly rly good experience so far,btohqsg
Go unfollow all the news n stuff,btohqsg
Use it for cat/dog subs and hobby subs,btohqsg
at least in rc  maybe during weekends and like the start/end of sem  but during the bulk of the sem itself i dont really see people playing mahjong frequently actually,btohqsg
and rc every floor got lounge one so the noise is usually contained there,btohqsg
Don't send here ltr get deleted,btohqsg
There goes my free survey results,btohqsg
long timers here can send right,btohqsg
event workshops can uh if got admin approval?,btohqsg
Surveys go to the inferior platform,btohqsg
This can  if got admin approval,btohqsg
Tbh I'm not that active an admin here anymore,btohqsg
i dont even rmbr me ever opening up sgexams discord ngl,btohqsg
Does anyone have any recommendations for horror books?I've read like fazbear frights and other horror series so am looking for more.,btohqsg
Anyone know when sp timetable coming out ah,btohqsg
Wah at first i thought uni life gon be fun then i see yall say like until so mundane liddat ☠☠☠,btohqsg
I thought freddy fazbear for a moment 💀,btohqsg
Agreed ☠☠☠ but they said when we work   we wld miss our studying phase,btohqsg
Maybe wut ur working in is ur passion ah,btohqsg
And all the uni kids popping out,btohqsg
No ah i in poly but i vv curious abt how uni is,btohqsg
all i can say is enjoy poly while you can haha,btohqsg
No eh   vvvv draining cus everyone so compet sia,btohqsg
My friends in lyfe sci complain,btohqsg
In uni hor its not j competitive,btohqsg
U sometimes feel hopeless aft u see how good some ppl are,btohqsg
at least poly lectures are easy to follow,btohqsg
Sian cus iw go life sci in uni de,btohqsg
U see ppl getting pre U internships that ppl usually get for penultimate year,btohqsg
what u learn in poly for 3 years can be learnt in 1 sem in uni jun,btohqsg
I feel like experience> normal work,btohqsg
I think u j like ur job ah,btohqsg
The resume will look damn sick,btohqsg
I wish i will feel the same way,btohqsg
Oso heard for poly internship the grade if don get A oso gpa can fly kite,btohqsg
They want us to suck up to the bosses that bad?,btohqsg
i think back in my poly days  internship grade was worth 22 CUs,btohqsg
Coz for internship u usually get better n better internships,btohqsg
so like if u fk up it is gone,btohqsg
So if u get a decent internship pre U,btohqsg
Ur last internship is gnna be damn good,btohqsg
Then if they offer u job,btohqsg
Getting an A in internship is basically just doing your tasks and sucking up to bosses?,btohqsg
I think so and have good relations with ur supervisor,btohqsg
If they dont like u cus of face problem then rip lo,btohqsg
If ur boss ask u to die then die,btohqsg
Ask the supervisor whether u can be a slave to him or her?,btohqsg
Go to your supervisor's house and start cleaning,btohqsg
have fun during poly while u can woohoo,btohqsg
Try ba   still got like a week + till sch reopen,btohqsg
Better enjoy now b4 shitshow start again HAAHAHAH,btohqsg
in uni  u will have lectures during exam week,btohqsg
Saturday morning exams really makes me think abt life,btohqsg
Before anyone yeett me imma delete that,btohqsg
Everyone that is going by the book are an NPC,btohqsg
As extra pair of hands yes  especially if workload a lot,btohqsg
Depends on your supervisor  coz for my uni intern  the previous batch ie my seniore actually often went MIA for 2 to 3 hours straight. Their boss gave them A still,btohqsg
On the other extreme  some bosses insist cap you at B coz they say if give A means no more room for improvement,btohqsg
Both I also call bs  I won't give this sort of 垃圾 no meaning marks,btohqsg
