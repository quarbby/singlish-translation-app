I'm going to take a while to research. Still busy with other things in life,btohqsg
Crypto got everyone signed up happily staked and now reduced all the perks,btohqsg
the lesson learned: be careful with 'promotion periods'  they didn't promise you it would last forever ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
Anyone manage to get cash back by topping up Revolut with SC unlimited cash back cc??,btohqsg

Hi all  would like to know if anyone able to successfully use revoult virtual card with gojek?,btohqsg
at least revolut tells you the end date of their promotion. and anything beyond that is a nice bonus. CDC abruptly nerfed their rates and gave us no time to do anything.,btohqsg
Hi  may i know if the UOB absolute cashback card still giving cashback for grab topups?,btohqsg
Guys  anybody know this is the right account to transfer usd to FTX pro?,btohqsg

Hi  for cardup to pay for monthly insurance  can I confirm if I use UOB one credit card to pay  it will also consider eligible spend for my monthly 500/1000/2000tier spend?,btohqsg
but the cash back still a bit...,btohqsg
I have been thinking about this. if you use AMEX to top up grab wallet and use AXS to pay for insurance. you actually earn 1.5-1.7%. which is about the same as cardup and UOB One combo,btohqsg
Yeap I am thinking the same. Because I also have a UOB one bank account  to eligible for level 1  I need a monthly 500 spend (can be combined) on selective UOB credit/debit card.,btohqsg
So I would want to have my UOB fully utilise before I go for firm 1.5% cashback for my AMEX,btohqsg
"Like I mention over here  you need to hit just nice $500 or $1000. if not you are ""short changing"" yourself. The only benefit is the additional cashback like shopee  grab and etc.",btohqsg
Yeap I am calculating the 500 well spend on UOB One credit card.,btohqsg
Nice  if worse come to worse can buy FairPrice gift card.,btohqsg
Also wanted to share this  I top up revolut  then transfer out. I get this.,btohqsg
Yes  I learn all this good tips  from you all.How good it is if UOB one do have the extra cashback for FairPrice. Hardly go daily farm.,btohqsg
from where to where? I transfer from grab to revolut to CDC $4500 since Feb 2022. Excluding the AMEX TCB first $5000 from grab to revolut then back to bank,btohqsg
But I did bank deposit at least $100 every month and use it to take public transport and get 20% cashback.,btohqsg
My flow is  Amex > grabpay > revolut > bank.,btohqsg
A lot of us got revolut because we using it to top up CDC  using it for public transport or at least use it for oversea spending.Grab > revolut > bank is too obvious already.,btohqsg
Ok  Yeap I tested it small amount,btohqsg
Now I know I should avoid that,btohqsg
Another cardup service I saw it rental payment. Will find out more about it..,btohqsg
Avoid  after top up Revolut > bank. Initial thinking  get 1.5% off by paying my monthly rental using this method. The 1.5% is source from Amex TCB,btohqsg
Oh can actually just use Amex > gpmc then can stack the reward,btohqsg
I assume you are getting 1.5% by paying for monthly rental to your landlord bank account.,btohqsg
So now if we spend 500 1000 2000 all will be at 3.33% only?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGso for UOB  the spend category is not important ald? I.e. 500 1000 2000?,btohqsg
Seriously  I dun understand why they changed and still call it tier 1 2 3,btohqsg
Gosh now not many attractive credit cards in the market anymore,btohqsg
Very trouble to track the uob,btohqsg
Use Amex 1.7% with gpmc almost similar,btohqsg
yup  just use AMEX with gpmc  unless you can hit 30k a month on gpmc or you have specific high spending like shopee or grab for UOB One where you'll get additional 5%. That additional cashback is a separate cap at $100 a month,btohqsg
I guess cardup is the way to go for you.,btohqsg
Guys how to claim for the ipad after hitting the 500$ spend limit ?,btohqsg
Citi was running a promotion this month,btohqsg
