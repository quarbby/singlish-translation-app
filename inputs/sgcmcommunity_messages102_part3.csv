Not sure what he meant by“Having three little rascals means that a sloping roofline isn't quite as reasonably spacious  even if the kids are as pint-sized as their father.”The roofline slopes the largest after the rear passenger’s head area aka the boot. The Rear passenger headroom is decreased marginally. I am 180 and can fit perfectly in the rear of the C40.,btohqsg
Not to mention  the C40’s panoramic roof actually increases the ceiling height as the glass is attched higher than the ceiling padding.The problem with CMA platform which the Polestar 2  XC40 and C40 uses is the small rear windows which makes the rear passenger feel slight claustrophobic. Partnered with the upright rear seat  long journey’s would mean motion sickness for the rear passenger. The C40 and Polestar 2 improved this by having the panoramic roof  something which the XC40 do not  which allows more light to the cabin. The XC40 sunroof do not extent to the rear passenger hence does not effectively improve the lack of daylight caused by the small windows.In fact  i believe kids in general would love the C40 better because it allows so much more light in  and the C40 feels slightly better built than the XC40.The only downside for the C40 for me would be the smaller bootspace as compared to the XC40 because i have to put my dogs behind hence the only deal breaker imo.,btohqsg
