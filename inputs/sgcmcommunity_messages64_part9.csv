U mean turn on after u park for a while?,btohqsg

@SGCM_Adminwas it J or R that never see i30 with pops and bangs,btohqsg
Because it’s safer. In the mist like in venting highlands it’s better to leave parking lights on. Safer for them and for your car. That’s what it’s designed for,btohqsg
No. Not at all. It uses very little energy,btohqsg
It turns on small lights only to enable others to see. Can be left on for a few hours. No problem at all,btohqsg
