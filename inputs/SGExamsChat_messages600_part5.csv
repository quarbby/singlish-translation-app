Lucky I don't frequent discord often,btohqsg
gen alpha is 2010 onwards or,btohqsg
And if I ever do open discord  it's only to check on my game's market/economy,btohqsg
ppl keep confusing me with generations and the shit they share,btohqsg
not directed to anyone here but,btohqsg
Why discord so much things gg on one,btohqsg
I don't hear that from tele,btohqsg
Oh and those illegal Tele grp chats,btohqsg
some kid leaked us security secrets,btohqsg
I think he’s in jail now,btohqsg
i’ve been on enough discord servers tho,btohqsg
every year i log onto sgexams discord and lose brain cells,btohqsg
luckily it's a once a year thing,btohqsg
it makes me feel better about my brain cells,btohqsg
i’m using them for better things than talking abt wtv they talk abt,btohqsg
shabu sai is nicer to me but more pricey sukiya is a little more like a generic japanese restaurant that's q affordable me thinks,btohqsg
Shabu sai the portion so little bruh I every time ask for 10 sets the waiter look at me like so weird,btohqsg
feels like it depends on the outlet u visit,btohqsg
I mean  I go hotpot buffet I can usually eat 2kg mutton,btohqsg
then it's a sign to not visit shabu sai @ westgate next time,btohqsg
the one at nex not bad but it's probably too far,btohqsg
i mean if it’s buffet doesn’t rlly matter right,btohqsg
tbh if hotpot buffet  go Chinatown,btohqsg
anyway just checked that sukiya prices tend to be $1-2 more but they have q a few promotions usually lol,btohqsg
just go people house self hotpot,btohqsg
okay ! so ppl in the disc have been asking me to make more friends during jc orientation,btohqsg
but ppl (incl me) ady have their own friends,btohqsg

tbh I don't really have friends from jc,btohqsg
Mostly from secondary and a few from ns,btohqsg

i kept in contact with zero from before ns,btohqsg

Plus my year covid  I nvr even take part in cca,btohqsg
jc can be quite good if you actively try to make friends,btohqsg
but even my super outgoing mentee ended up just keeping to her class + cca,btohqsg
everything else is from stuff she joined,btohqsg
Aiya I tell u  the most important place to make friends is not jc but uni,btohqsg
