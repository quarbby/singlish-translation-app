based on current COE it will be 230k+,btohqsg
That is when I will switch to lane 1,btohqsg
so can expect GR86 to be around that price... the PI one is good deal now,btohqsg
But of course even if I am going 90km/h  there is still going to be a random car (usually continental) overtake and squeeze in front of me,btohqsg
