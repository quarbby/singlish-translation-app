The new lalamove app is running at the back ground even though I clear the apps background and not starting the app..,btohqsg
It was the case for me first few days after i download  and yes batt drain fastThen now its ok,btohqsg
I cant rem but i dont think i changed any settings...but u can try switch off notifications and all that first,btohqsg
Ok thanks alot. but if off notifications  any update i will not be receiving the msg.. seems dumb though...,btohqsg
But new app not in use yet mah,btohqsg
Rightfully correct.. hope that once the app in use wun drain out that fast.. anyway thanks for your reply!!!🙏🙏,btohqsg
Oh ok i see what u meanI was assuming it wont be that bad when new app in use  cos then only running 1 instead of 2 llm apps 🤷,btohqsg
Hahah.. My problem is both apps are not online and not running in back ground but the battery drain damn fast  doesn't seems normal.. before installing this new app  my phone still can last the whole day.. but after installing this new app  it drain out ard evening time..,btohqsg
Oh old app also not on... LolYes i had that for abt 2 days also  suddenly batt cant last thru the day,btohqsg
Yeah that notification kept coming up,btohqsg
Both lalamove not online and apps are not running in background but still having this notification,btohqsg
Yes yesI really cant rem wat i did to get rid of itBut like u say  once its in use will prob pop up again,btohqsg
Even not running at background still gt this issue.. this is causing the battery drain,btohqsg
Sis.. btw I dun have this issue now??,btohqsg
Go to settings > apps > lalamove driver > battery,btohqsg
"There u can toggle ""allow background activity""",btohqsg
Battery drain out fast after installing the new app,btohqsg
oh. i still using the old one,btohqsg
But means when u doing lalamove cant leave it in backgrd.... Lol,btohqsg
Yup.. I presume if any update  lalamove running in background will not notify..,btohqsg
So depends on how u usually do lalamove lor,btohqsg
Yup.. anyway thanks for your prompt reply... At least I know I m not the only one encounter this issue..!!,btohqsg
