Hey guys  question on pumping petrol in Malaysia,btohqsg
Today my first time pump petrol using credit card at caltex in JB,btohqsg
I remember I pump 34rm worth of petrol but my credit card was charged 200rm!!!,btohqsg
I found out from the bank that all petrol kiosk in MY charge 200 rm temporarily to our credit or debit card and then refund u back and charge u the exact amount u pump,btohqsg
Did any of u experience this when pumping petrol in MY?,btohqsg
No  most of us use cash,btohqsg
We go to counter pass them 100rm to open pump. Then you go pump how much you need  after pumped go to counter do you payment/refund.,btohqsg
He must be go counter ask to open pump kiosk,btohqsg
This is my first time and only discovered got such temporary charge for using credit card to pump petrol.,btohqsg
Nevertheless...should be able to get refund..just keep an eye on yiur bank statement,btohqsg
Nxt time go in yiu can use card to deduct after filling or pay via cash,btohqsg
to avoid holding fee  can give them your card. if you ok.they will open pump then when u r done go collect back card.,btohqsg
Use cash better bro. If want use card I would recommend go petronas  their pump kiosk got paywave machine  tap card then open pump. After pump they only charge you how much you pump. Nothing more.Petronas country wide all have paywave machine. Easy for us who don't carry much cash.Don't need go counter deposit rm to open pump kiosk  just at your pump kiosk tap card  will auto open,btohqsg
It's okay  everyone gets to learn,btohqsg
I very heart pain after seeing 200 fly away temporarily,btohqsg
It's like a deposit bro. No worries,btohqsg
The bank assured me they will refund the 200,btohqsg
Keep an eye on yiur Bank statement ..should be okie de,btohqsg
Nothing much to be worry about,btohqsg
Nxt time can jio us go petrol run..see anyone of us want go.anot,btohqsg
No worries  will surely revert back to u,btohqsg
It's just pre authorisation  not actual transaction,btohqsg
Caltex malaysia also do the same. I went to Caltec at Johor Jaya to pump today.,btohqsg
