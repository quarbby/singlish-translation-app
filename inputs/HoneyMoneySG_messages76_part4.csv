Hi guys  I have recently gotten my HSBC Revo  I have yet to enrol into the miles program.Is this where I should be doing the miles transfer after the enrolment? Or is it in some other place in the app?,btohqsg
30th Sep is a Saturday. What time did u empty your account?,btohqsg
May I just confirm that to get the SingSaver Rewards  I have to spend $500,btohqsg
hey chris  citigold call and say you are doing MISREPRESETATION. they are going after you now. standby for call. they say that if there is a fixed deposit placement  singsaver promo prize will not apply now.,btohqsg
ya they no longer accept FD placement as part of the criteria for promo prize,btohqsg
when did they changed? singsaver cockup or citibank,btohqsg
actually can just leave the $250k there in savings acc as AUM,btohqsg
Where did you get rthe message that I said fixed deposit will qualify for singsaver rewards?,btohqsg
It merely mentioned a fixed deposit rate by citigold. And there is a singsaver promo for citigold.,btohqsg
250k in tbill is 3.8% yield for 6mth is more than the promo money.,btohqsg
singsaver promot dont apply if its a fixed d placement apparently. u can talk to singsaver or citigold for clarification. not sure if they will take action on u. better remove ur video.,btohqsg
yes. i know. previously they accept FD as part of AUM for the promo prizes. So was a better deal compared to now,btohqsg
so i meants that chris cockup and show the wrong info.,btohqsg
see the date on singsaver. its 31 may 2023 ending.,btohqsg
Actually whatever  wherever the case  please do ur own due deligence to check on any offers.You can't be joining some free update channels and expect every word taken from it to be the 100% truth.Even every investment channels will put a disclaimer on it.,btohqsg
of course i did  thats what was discovered. it is important for finfluencer to be precise and remove fake info as much as possible.,btohqsg
You sue Chris any lawyer or judge will laugh at you man.,btohqsg
i dont bother  its citibank that say one.,btohqsg
First of all  I have not associated signing up for Singsaver with the 3.7% p.a. promo. These are two separate thing.Secondly I have already pointed out to you the T&Cs document. Point 2 already put it out there.Thirdly  there were no sign-ups for Citigold via my link ever since that video. So I am not sure where you come from.,btohqsg
There is no way to prove liability since he is not an FA and forcing you to signup that offer by promising a prize,btohqsg
ok lah  u song can liao. whatever it is  your video on fixed deposit  then citigold narrative is quite obvious pointing to citibank customer have 3.7 deposit via singsaver,btohqsg
of course  let them go sort out lor. who cares.,btohqsg
If u did then kudos to u.I think even if u did not check and apply with approval from citigold.The most u know cannot get the prize or the FD. Thats about it.,btohqsg
Citibank at most issue cease and desist if there is false info or a correction order,btohqsg
ya la. see what happens lor.,btohqsg
Yes and that is not a loss so nothing will be awarded,btohqsg
just informing him to watch out for contact,btohqsg
So jialat share lobang also will Kenna threatened. Luckily I keep all lobangs for myself ü§£,btohqsg
All good lobangs have to ownself find one. Like PE won‚Äôt go out advertise for customers,btohqsg

Activate MoneyBull and convert to Margin ac only right?No need to manually subscribe to the fund right?,btohqsg
"You can don't subscribe by increasing the ""retained amount"" but in that case there will be opportunity cost",btohqsg
T&Cs say only need to convert to margin and activate moneybull,btohqsg
I think its autosweep into the Fullerton fund.. Isit not?,btohqsg
Yes  it is auto but you may also adjust the retained amount such that these amounts will not be auto-swept,btohqsg
Most importantly hold the deposits till 29/2/2024,btohqsg
Hi all shifus  tried to signup for the CIMB visa signature  but unable to‚Ä¶ suggestions?,btohqsg
