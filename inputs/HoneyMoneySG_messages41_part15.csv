If you regularly process $800 per month through your card  you can go for OCBC 365  Citi Cashcack or BOC Family (for cashback cards),btohqsg
Or if miles cards are your thing  UOB Lady's (with dining selected as the category)  Citi Rewards + Amaze  HSBC Revolution,btohqsg
for this category in my opinion cashback is more worth it compared to miles,btohqsg
which condition may be violated by withdrawing everything?,btohqsg
Anyone know Shopee installment also got uob 5%?,btohqsg
hi people  can anyone advise for amaze + uob lady  all transaction spent will be translated as online so which catergory should i choose for 6 miles per dollar accumulation?,btohqsg
Hi all  will I earn 4mpd if i make my payment with CRMC with shopback?,btohqsg
Link your card to the Shopback app directly to get 4mpd (not through apple pay),btohqsg
"There is no ""online"" category for uob Lady's card. Just pick the category you spend most often",btohqsg
HSBC Revo 37 monthsCiti Rewards 5 yearsUOB PPV 2 yearDBS Women World Card 12 months,btohqsg
ic. so it doesnt do what crmc do that amaze translate all transaction to online to be eligible for 4mpd ?,btohqsg
Hi   what the difference between apply credit at online and at  roadshow? Is get different free gift?,btohqsg
Yeap ive been more interested in cashback. Thanks for your input!Wont crmc amaze be better for forex payments?,btohqsg
Yes. It is also great for people who don't want to bother tracking minimum spend,btohqsg
Can also use Amaze+crmc to get 4mpd (capped for $1k spend in statement month) for local spend so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
Seems a bit shady man. Remember your name is now on all the transactions  any illicit activity  you kena.,btohqsg
Anyone here knows how to use the Caltex vouchers from Trust app? Coz i am still waiting for physical card. Do I have to link Trust card to Google Pay so that I can pay Caltex and apply voucher?,btohqsg
when is the time should i cancel my cc?9months after application?or wait after 1 year and after call cso to waive off my cc annual fee?,btohqsg
Read terms and condition just to confirm. Normally is 1 year.,btohqsg
BOC sheng siong card at 6% for SS purchases and 1.5% for others,btohqsg
Cash-heavy as in ‚Äúcash is king‚Äù tourists who refuse to use their CCs  possibly due to forex charges etc! Nothing shady :),btohqsg
Hi  will using UOB preferred platinum or UOB visa signature at esso for petrol be eligible for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Oh also we accept Atome and Favepay if that broadens the suggestions. TIA!,btohqsg
Can anyone let me know if I‚Äôm  correct . I opened HSBC EGA account on yesterday 22/4 and I plan to put 100k on 24/4 . So once I put in . I don‚Äôt have to do anything just wait until 1/8 then withdraw them all out . I will be able to earn 4.35% for the next 3 months right ? May June July IPM 362 . 3 month total $1086,btohqsg
need to sms register for the bonus interest. Can also earn interest for average daily balance in Apr.,btohqsg
what is the cashback rates if i use crmc x amaze ?,btohqsg
Anyone here experienced couldn‚Äôt applied for credit card even tho u meet the requirements,btohqsg
Yeah  register via phone or online first with your account number just to be sure,btohqsg
Question on Trust Card... If I have a supplementary card issued to a family member  when they install app  can they help to use the coupons together with their Trust supp card? Else I can't use up those coupons before they expire if I am the only one who can use them,btohqsg
Hello folks  Has anyone cancelled a DBS credit card and the bank rejects any bank transfer to pay the remaining balance?,btohqsg
I don't have personal experience. I assume u mean u have a IPP with DBS and u initiate a customer-end cancellation request?,btohqsg
What is an ipp? Yes I initiated the cancellation,btohqsg
Ah it‚Äôs actually when I cancelled  the DBS rep helped me transfer my points to miles  which incurred the $25 fee being the remaining balance. Now I cannot log into ibanking  attempts to pay are rejected  and call center is telling me to go to the branch because they can‚Äôt do anything üòÖ,btohqsg
Oh I seeee :) thanks for sharing the context.,btohqsg
for citi rewards points i gt 50k points that can be converted to 20k miles,btohqsg
does converting 25k points or 50k points cost more or the same ?,btohqsg
Do u all always get waive for the citi card annual fee,btohqsg
Beside sms register is there any others requirements I miss out ?,btohqsg
erm. not sure that is correct. u will only earn bonus interest for topup.Say April is $0 then May is $100k  May topup is 100k. u will earn 4.35% on this.June u do nothing. June topup is $0. June interest is 0.05 of 100k,btohqsg
Actually I‚Äôm confused too . Maybe put 3 months FD 3.75% is a safe option,btohqsg
Don't try to confuse. If you send the sms in apr  the topup will be referenced to mar... for the months Apr to Jul. You will at least get 4.35% from Apr to Jul.,btohqsg
My step are correct right . I opened HSBC EGA account on yesterday 22/4 an then sms HSBC 74722forregister step 2 put 100k on 24/4 . So once I put in . I don‚Äôt have to do anything just wait until 1/8 then withdraw them all out . I will be able to earn 4.35% for the next 3 months right ? May June July IPM 362 . 3 month total $1086,btohqsg
I get all my Citi cards waived every year.,btohqsg
Yes  except the part whereby you get monthly interest based on number of days in the month and not ipm.,btohqsg
And you still get your interest in apr,btohqsg
how much interest do you earn for the 100k for the month of July?,btohqsg
According to Chris YouTube video it should be $362 if I do all the step correctly,btohqsg
you opened your account in Apr  special interest will be for which 3 months?,btohqsg
