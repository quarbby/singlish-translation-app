I always use their black pen,btohqsg
I got a phobia of blue,btohqsg
Like i keep thinking unlucky colour,btohqsg
Like all my pens are black,btohqsg
I from acroball 1.0 then I change to pilot g2 0.7 blue pen,btohqsg
This is way more better than the pilot g2,btohqsg
@its_shxnu 1.0 all the way ah,btohqsg
During my O level time  I loved to use that pen to write on the legend paper (for POA) as it made me feel like I wrote nicer😅But now I rarely use pen because of HBL and usually my exams were done by using laptop,btohqsg
I cant find this in popular.-.,btohqsg
I only know that correction tape and ink pen are strongly not recommended to be used,btohqsg
any1 can tell mi where to get tis other than shamelessly taking from dsta,btohqsg
omg my pharmacist nvr scold me@its_shxn,btohqsg
Just be careful not to throw away wrong medication again,btohqsg
They say rp easy  grad all the same cert as the other polys,btohqsg
rp is not easier than any other poly,btohqsg
This one depends on the course,btohqsg
NoI didn't have to write report everyday,btohqsg
But I see from like an online forum like uni or if u go work they will rather take in ppl from like example ngeean or sp,btohqsg
lemme ask u this qns I asked myself back when I was a Os student,btohqsg
np/sp 3.73 gpa rp 4.0 gpa,btohqsg
This one is falseOkayInitially it was true because RP used to be a dumping groundBut now the time has changedThey start accepting the ppl from RP,btohqsg
cuz  I will say 1 thign,btohqsg
Start accepting le?? But not widely as the other polys ?,btohqsg
its like how ppl looked down on ite,btohqsg
ite ppl got 4.0 gpa and poly ppl got 1.8 gpa,btohqsg
they will keep ite student then to poly,btohqsg
not everyone starts on the same ground,btohqsg
u dont have to start off in the same poly,btohqsg
its the amount of hardwork u put in,btohqsg
But studying in RP has one more benefit than other polysRP has problem-based learning. Almost everyday the students have to do the presentation and solve the real-life problems. Keep on training to do the presentation and real-life problems  then won't be struggling when you're in university or in the workplace,btohqsg
to show how worthy u r,btohqsg
and one more benefit is u only got 1 mod per day,btohqsg
source the eae webinar from XX years ago,btohqsg
unlike other poly more than 1,btohqsg
So like initially I did some research la they said ngeean was the best at business so that's why I wanted to go there go pfp and take common business programme,btohqsg
Right that's what my brother said too,btohqsg
totally not once a sec 4na,btohqsg
My brother just told me he had a like 30min lecture then the lecturer dismiss them,btohqsg
now lecture all online and prerecorded haaahha,btohqsg
All ppl around me said pfp is good etc,btohqsg
"technically u dont even have to ""attend"" them 😂",btohqsg
So naturally all students try to aim pfp lah,btohqsg
now u hear 4 4na kiddos saying its a skem ah,btohqsg
So I also wanted aim for pfp not cuz bandwagon la,btohqsg
if I can find my pfp shit notes,btohqsg
But my goal before my brother told me was to go ngeean take common business programe,btohqsg
My cousin said he learnt basic sec 3 math,btohqsg
But now he say ngeean is shit,btohqsg
And tells me not to go therr,btohqsg
Then he also told me if he can rewind back he rather go rp,btohqsg
That's why I asked this question,btohqsg
I did not regret gg ib,btohqsg
from my edu path can tell my age lah,btohqsg
@aceberriesWhat course are you aiming to study? I'm just curious,btohqsg
Now I got doubts cuz of what my brother told me,btohqsg
He rather go rp than ngeean,btohqsg
But I heard so much stigma about rp that idrk if I should go anot,btohqsg
Even my teachers have stigma of rp,btohqsg
"and i quote ""every school is the same"" 😂",btohqsg
But when even ur teachers says the same stigmas,btohqsg
I need to have a goal to work hard uk,btohqsg
honestly its depends on ucos how well u do depends on yr hardworknot the sch u're going,btohqsg
but u can get what u want from every sch!,btohqsg
u can succeed in any school! :),btohqsg
but tbh i dont like grp prj,btohqsg
I mean honestly there's no one for all answer lor  but I think now its slowly moving towards seeing all schls the same,btohqsg
YeahIt depends on your skills and knowledge  why would the company ever bother where you study in?,btohqsg
if you want to hear the argument right... its available all over the internet,btohqsg
like this is similar to asking NUS vs NTU vs SMU vs SUTD vs SIT etc etc,btohqsg
anyone wanna have a good laugh,btohqsg
Idk thays what I see multiple forums sayong,btohqsg
will they eventually get a consensus? haha,btohqsg
At the end of the day  my conclusion is  as long as you're good no matter where you go u'll do well.,btohqsg
You just gotta be the top,btohqsg
Because a valedictorian in RP is definitely better than an average joe in say NP/SP,btohqsg
example la might be abit of a stretch,btohqsg
but the idea is what nameless say,btohqsg
that count the total amount of msg,btohqsg
WoahSo many messages in this group😅,btohqsg
in terms of securing a job,btohqsg
so I guess no one wants a,btohqsg
Anyone wanna play some phone games w mee,btohqsg
eh btw anyone know why sometimes u buy stuff online nid to have the like code to pay sometiems dunnid,btohqsg
whats the best hospital in Singapore,btohqsg

HahaI think I was like you when I was in sec 5My POA teacher was very strictI didn't want to get scolded by her again  yet I totally forgot to do the homeworkI had to wake up at around 4am to do homework as I didn't know how long I was gonna take to finish that POA homework😂,btohqsg
You're having Geo paper 2 exam today?All the bestYou can do it!😊,btohqsg
I'm stressNo mood to study :(,btohqsg
F*** the daily gradesLessons 8  9 and 10 of my 3D printing module are graded as one gradeMy final grade for those 3 lessons were affected very badly just because I applied LOA for lesson 8,btohqsg
I could really get BBut because I missed out lesson 8  even if got LOA  I got C😭,btohqsg
How about you? Why you're feeling same as me?,btohqsg
The DSA results out on my bday,btohqsg
Oh :(Maybe you can see your results the day after your birthday?,btohqsg
Any Ngee Ann poly students here?,btohqsg
If you’re asking whether or not you should come here don’t,btohqsg
I remember someone here mentioned if he/she considers studying in RPAs I mentioned  RP has advantage  which is doing the presentation everyday  so won't feel struggling in the workplaceI'm sorry for forgetting to tell you the disadvantage  which is the daily gradesDaily grades is SUPER ANNOYING,btohqsg
I mean it’s useful for maintaining your GPA,btohqsg
Is that the one like general paper,btohqsg
It’s like the made in China version of entrepreneurship,btohqsg
Plus everyone is so competitive in the business school,btohqsg
Heard a lot of snakes inside haha...,btohqsg
Every team spent like 30+ hours coding for the project,btohqsg
Uhh haven’t seen many so far,btohqsg
Hey guys I heard there was an EAE gc but I can't seem to find it : ) does anyone have link?,btohqsg
Btw did the HPB come to ur schs to show u the vid abt HIV lol,btohqsg
Is it actually your birthday today?,btohqsg
Since it comes out in your bday  just think that the result is positiveThink positive  don't think negativeHappy birthday in advance!,btohqsg
Okay  I shall note it down in my calendar,btohqsg
There  there  kid  it'll be alright! We're all proud of you regardless of the results  you got this  Kid!,btohqsg
I think study at TP or NYP may be the best,btohqsg
You're welcome  Kid  you got this!,btohqsg
RP is the only polytechnic that has daily grades  which can be super annoying when the daily grades become 60% or 100%You only have one day to submit the worksheet and RJ for each lessonAnd  for many modules  you have to take class test (known as Practice Questions) right after the end of lessonFor NYP  the deadline can be slightly longer  so I think that you don't need to feel much stressful (I think TP also) (but I'm not sure if this depends on the course you're taking or not)And don't have to take class test right after each lessonAnd for both NYP and TP  you will get full notes (can't remember if it's before or during the lesson)  which unlike RP,btohqsg
My Fren say sp not bad,btohqsg
Also  do update us with the new stickers  okay!,btohqsg
Your poly should depend on the field that you’re interested in,btohqsg
if it’s business feel free to come to NP,btohqsg
Mass Comm has a reputation in the school for being the course of weirdos,btohqsg
bcomm is a pain in the ass,btohqsg
no its known for being the most toxic,btohqsg
Was thinking ngeean but my brother told me how bad it was,btohqsg
Ok BA soc toxic acc to my senior but yes,btohqsg
I havent seen the ugly side yet and I hope idh to,btohqsg
What exactly is the ugly side,btohqsg
My class is ok so far but it is just so stressful,btohqsg
my advisor told me im taking a business diploma rather than a tourism diploma and i got so confused,btohqsg
Sorry sorry??? I don't get it 😂😂,btohqsg
And some of the modules are so useless they give me brain cancer,btohqsg
i don't even get how to do the Assignment gg,btohqsg
i prefer the grp proj eh,btohqsg
YESYou will feel super annoyed when doing the group project,btohqsg
If business go tp or nyp is it bad?,btohqsg
idk la cos for me my grp got ppl who know how to write reports so i cld ask them for help if im unsure,btohqsg
It’s ok next semester will be worse,btohqsg
no im like the one doing 80% of the work imma die,btohqsg
Eh but full honesty I would say for business either Ngee Ann or SP,btohqsg
i heard TP biz boring ah,btohqsg
I think it's quite good  but more competitive (can't remember haha),btohqsg
But how leh got alot of ppl here say ngeean bad,btohqsg
Idk I want all opinions possible,btohqsg
Well that might be because of the whole SU fiasco,btohqsg
But I would say that this is true,btohqsg
only possible bad parts happen when u get into toxic company,btohqsg
Some of the modules really do equip you to work in business,btohqsg
idh many cos i dont make friends w any tom dick n harry,btohqsg
im lazy to read the past 3.1k messages,btohqsg
And the extracurriculars are sick too,btohqsg
np business known for the best business courses across the polys,btohqsg
But the downside is that the useless modules are a nightmare and Ye some people are toxic/slackers,btohqsg
I planning take common business programme since idk what business to actually take,btohqsg
u just need to follow the format 🤣,btohqsg
But I wanna take business generally,btohqsg
i struggle w content too pls,btohqsg
Nah peer evaluation scares them too much,btohqsg
My group had this guy from biomed,btohqsg
Did literally nothing for the whole project,btohqsg
I hate the transparency of peer evaluation,btohqsg
Then my group marked him down hahaha,btohqsg
His IMP grade is gonna become screwed,btohqsg
cuz ik for a fact that even if u complain to teacher some dont take action one,btohqsg
ive heard from my poly friends,btohqsg
Haha yesIf y'all remember what happened to my FYP group  it's a hell because of slackers in my group,btohqsg
Some of us gave him ‘strongly disagree’ for contribution,btohqsg
For those in poly I plan on going common business programme if I can make it to pfp . Advisable? Any risk about it??,btohqsg
Uhhh I would say use PFP to maybe decide on which course you desire,btohqsg
ya ive seen extreme cases of ppl just MIA-ing the entire project,btohqsg
Ah yea I planning pfp that,btohqsg
IMO it’s better to decide earlier,btohqsg
Because CBP is kinda a waste of time,btohqsg
yea then y1 can change course,btohqsg
Got alot of type of business idk le,btohqsg
Nononas in use PFP to choose which exact business course you want,btohqsg
same then suddenly appear during grp presentation then we need to give him something to say like...,btohqsg
Instead of entering CBP then deciding from there,btohqsg
I HAD TO CREATE HIS BLOODY SLIDES FOR HIM,btohqsg
Then if dl then change in y1?,btohqsg
they say got exposure but its bs cos year 1 same modules,btohqsg
And I heard from my friendMy friend's friend is in a group that all her teammates were guysThen  all of them bullied her in the way that they give all the tasks to that girl to do,btohqsg
If liddat then I dkwhich business in pfp,btohqsg
once i singlehandedly tanked my entire chinese project in sec 3 cuz my partner did NOTHING. at all,btohqsg
That’s the one that’ll really drive you,btohqsg
eh u legit js want business is it? like dk which part at all,btohqsg
and then we had to type a essay about a certain topic and create a video about it then i had to write out the script all by myself,btohqsg
Anyone here considering going to Chinese Media@Ngee Ann Poly?,btohqsg
AND THE TUTOR CUT MY GRPMATES OFF,btohqsg
No like I generally decided on business but not sure exactly which one,btohqsg
Intake is only like 50 annually,btohqsg
i threw my chinese out of the window,btohqsg
ah yes thats kinda what i meant  you could go to a course thats more broad,btohqsg
Most Singaporeans hate Chinese including me,btohqsg
besides cbp theres courses called business,btohqsg
like for np its business studies,btohqsg
i like speaking Chinese tho hahah,btohqsg
theres 3 specialisations so in a way more choices yaknow,btohqsg
eh but business studies is insanely stressful,btohqsg
i miraculously passed the chinese project tho i got a C5,btohqsg
u didnt hear it frm me but tourism isnt that fun as it sounds,btohqsg
People there are all friggin elite,btohqsg
unfortunately my partner got the same mark as me,btohqsg
then my course got the highest score,btohqsg
but she was damn infamous for ponning sch and not submitting hw and MIA-ing in general,btohqsg
so the teachers alr knew beforehand,btohqsg
Yea same..I speak more Chinese than English!,btohqsg
I dropped my new phone on highway,btohqsg
mhm if my gpa damn shit  but touchwood ah,btohqsg
now i do find chinese fascinating haha,btohqsg
I heard the  int trade and business is good,btohqsg
or accountancy if u like math@aceberries,btohqsg
The people here are quite ok,btohqsg
id say every course is good frm the school#nobiashereok,btohqsg
but if u like itb go for it,btohqsg
But don’t worry I have no intention of pursuing trade as a career and the modules are still bearable,btohqsg
technically not too much of math actually,btohqsg
not that hard to enter compared to BS/ACC,btohqsg
Time to cry myself to sleep. Gdnite,btohqsg
It’s like a dumping ground for business studies rejects though hahahaha,btohqsg
Wait so why int trade and business,btohqsg
I chose it because I wasn’t sure which area of business I desired entering,btohqsg
So ITB have the most flexibility,btohqsg
ye isnt business studies most flexible,btohqsg
later I see Jude for another 3 years,btohqsg
Main issue is that it’s super competitive,btohqsg
U DONT LIKE HIM ISIT HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
um hi random qn for anyone that studies / take chemistry at o's   how should i prepare for chem prac ?,btohqsg

I heard from a friend sister that she wan to die,btohqsg
ok but for o levels its quite manageable lah,btohqsg
just rmb dont screw up the titration,btohqsg
Like I find the workload bearable,btohqsg
And so does most of my class,btohqsg
My whole Sec school class would laugh at me if I went to accountancy,btohqsg
Commonbusiness programe in year 1 then aft that need choose another course,btohqsg
That’s why honestly just decide earlier,btohqsg
HAHAHA u want calculate PVIFA for 2 more years no 😀,btohqsg
u can choose if yr unsure i guess,btohqsg
I’m dang shocked he came to NP BA,btohqsg
i felt he was a bit uh,btohqsg
I see ok I keep in mind,btohqsg
But he’s definitely not a frat boy,btohqsg
okay he happened to get a seat beside me but he signalled to another girl to take it,btohqsg
And his F and N in secondary school was dang good,btohqsg
The other girl was Ashley right,btohqsg
then he laughed when i told the class i eat rice without condiments during intro,btohqsg
so i had a bad impression of him,btohqsg
in my mind i was like nahhh bastard,btohqsg
Aiya he’s quite an ok guy,btohqsg
then like during classes i saw he present damn well,btohqsg
mentorship n industry prep? not a gpa module js like form teacher class sorta thing,btohqsg
Wait Kyle then for accountancy right,btohqsg

Camp 2 was dang inconvenient though,btohqsg

That takes like 5 minutes to climb,btohqsg
ok but i legit didnt enjoy the night at camp 1,btohqsg

If should take cbp in pfp then choose another course in y2,btohqsg
