There has been a lot of news regarding the plight of elderly hawkers  especially those who are currently not on food delivery apps during this period of time  where dine-ins are strictly prohibited due to the pandemic. As a result  many of them are considering closing their stalls. My team and I are organizing a 6-day hackathon event  where youths aged 14-24 can come together to brainstorm innovative solutions to help these elderly hawkers. During the hackathon  there are also workshops conducted to help each group better formulate their ideas and solutions.
