can ask... if we late sending item... cs can find out?,btohqsg
if customer complain yes there is penalty,btohqsg
After picking up the item of an order  CS called me up to request help to do a concurrent order by picking up another item nearby but sending to further destination. Trying to be nice  I agreed to the request. However when I request the 2nd order details  the pick up time was actually one hour later. How to do concurrent orders that were one hour apart?üßêAfter calling CS to explain the situation  my 2nd order was removed. But later I realised a $4 cancellation penalty slap onto me!üò† Should I continue to be helpful next time CS call me for help? üòû,btohqsg
Whole order cancel -$2 but give me back $2 maybe I'm not in the wrong,btohqsg

Maybe they will give u back $4,btohqsg
