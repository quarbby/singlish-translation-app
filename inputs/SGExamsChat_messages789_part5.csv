Someone who has been popular and active in school since Y1 + many of my juniors know her vs someone who I can't even recognize her face if I saw her irl,btohqsg
Ok ya that one makes sense,btohqsg
I deadass didn't pay attn at all,btohqsg
for our sch pres is y1-y6 vote,btohqsg
Idk what the fuck is the pt,btohqsg
and its like 1 class 2 facilitators  or smt,btohqsg
so like lets say this girl A was in student council since y3 and orientation leader in y2  then she has her CCA juniors  plus very active in the school  then she running against some JAE kid  it's q obvious that the Junior High votes will be heavily skewed in favour of the Ip girl,btohqsg
So even if alot of Senior High votes for the JAE  the Ip girl still has a statistically higher chance to win,btohqsg
It's almost no point to run for pres,btohqsg
I mean tbh there is a chance that a JAE could be pres BUT the chances are very slim,btohqsg
But I remember in my y1/y2  both contestants were IP,btohqsg
Then it's a bit more difficult to predict who will win since both are popular,btohqsg
No I don't like to be involved in politics,btohqsg
