was looking for a desktop and my aunt suggested aftershock cuz my cousin bought frm thr but aft hearing this idk man,btohqsg
i think ppl will come up w a fake,btohqsg
i kept thinking how come they can gibe such big discounts,btohqsg
Their og price already gives them big profit margins so they can afford to discount here and there,btohqsg
OH FINALLY I HAVE BEEN NOTICED üòç,btohqsg
of all desktop retailers/custom pc builders in sg whoch one is the btr one,btohqsg
It took a while for me to find a non official converter for my Samsung tablet lol,btohqsg
had this cheapo wire took so long to charge,btohqsg
this one like v common tactic for businesses nowadays,btohqsg
keep seeing everywhr wveryth on sale,btohqsg
True. I ‚Äòve used Apple for many years.,btohqsg
Nxt time i buy laptop i consult u@Voidchords,btohqsg

Well. It ‚Äòs possible to look it up online.,btohqsg
You can do better than prism,btohqsg
anyway for laptop I‚Äôve been using MSI,btohqsg
now i need monitor and desktop reccos üò´üò´,btohqsg
Ltt got video how to build quite in depth nit bad,btohqsg
I heard is sell customer data or ads in phone.,btohqsg
Actually can. If u wan u can always look at their cogs u can tell roughly whats the profit margin liao,btohqsg
I recommend Dell monitors. Very good customer service.,btohqsg
Can turn off no? My k20 pro has 0 ads,btohqsg
i scared one wrong move and everything cannot work haha plus im not v patient either üò≠,btohqsg
Too broke to get one oc,btohqsg
rigjt i was lurking in this chat backreading haha,btohqsg
oh ya anyone heard of the custom pc builder the keanetobuild guy?,btohqsg
You can also find out more local company malpractices to assist you in making informed decisions.,btohqsg
yez i think backreading the convo made me reconsider my decision of buying frm aftershock LOL,btohqsg
ooh i saw aoc monitors b4 but the price not as attractive as prism so i didnt pay much attn,btohqsg
my cousin uses aoc n i think q nice leh the display but i cldnt find the same monitor,btohqsg
Key thing is to know usage. What you plan to use for  I don't game so high refresh rate is secondary and I don't need the best viewing angle so I go really cheap,btohqsg
this one actl q nice but monitor abit too long scared stare so long kena strain sia haha,btohqsg
oh wtf taobao rly has everything ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
Strain due to length ? ü§≠,btohqsg
so big look frm left to right right to left,btohqsg
i cant read chinese to save my life üò≠,btohqsg
Viewing distance matters if u sit too near yes need to turn neck but mostly use eyes can see from one side to the other alr,btohqsg
i need to sit abit nearer to monitor cuz i cant see if sit further away haha i dun wear specs at home one,btohqsg
I think I‚Äôve been using the same Asus monitor for damn long lol,btohqsg
i wear specs at home cannot i feel v dizzy ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
My monitor I bought under 150sgd 23.8 inch   75hz   1ms response time,btohqsg
bcs usually afaik if u wear glasses then dizzy means ur eye power change alr,btohqsg
my friends power changes every 6 mths,btohqsg
if i stare at screen w glasses at home i feel dizzy,btohqsg
but even astigmatism it shouldnt matter if screen is seen at home or outside right?,btohqsg
when u change ur glasses u can ask the person there,btohqsg
I mean the lighting conditions would make a difference,btohqsg
wait is astigmatism noticeable like if u look in the persons eye can notice?,btohqsg
Is good for multi-tasking like opening more Windows but like what you mentioned   long displays are not for everyone.,btohqsg
how come IT can talk so long,btohqsg
