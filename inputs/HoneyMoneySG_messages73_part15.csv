Thanks! That’s what I’m wondering  does it not show the 9x remaining OCBC$ when credited?,btohqsg
1X posted with the transaction  bonus 9X is posted by the end of the next calendar month.,btohqsg
Yeap am aware  it’s been 2 months but I don’t see the 9X balance being reflected anywhere basically,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGu missed out on the $168 referral reward for moomoo.,btohqsg
Sad  it's not eligible  called the UOB side. But I realised UOB customer service is much faster and nicer  won't leave u hanging on the call for too long,btohqsg
If company website is always down and not professional   just skip it,btohqsg
Should be  make sure between 3-6k 😀,btohqsg
big ticket items purchase- which credit card wld u recommend pls? TIA!,btohqsg
If not online purchase ? Cos Harvey norman That kind of shop,btohqsg

Hi anyone know if the salary hack (transfer money to yourself with purpose code SALA) works for stanchart Bonus saver?,btohqsg
Just wanna check… when paying with Citi Payall  there will be a one-time service fee in order to earn the card rewards. If I choose another option of Citi Payall with zero fees  I don’t earn the card rewards.In this case  why would ppl choose to pay with Citi PayAll though? Or am I misunderstanding it?,btohqsg
Ppl pay the fee to earn card rewards,btohqsg
Hi guys  just received sms about my UOB Evol card got approved and see in UOB TMRW under “Accounts”Just want to check if I am able to see the card details or a virtual card to add to Apple Pay or use online now? Or have to wait for the physical card to arrive via mail?,btohqsg
Maybe it is just me  but isn't this spending pattern the perfect combi for UOB One card?Utilities (200ish) gets 4.33% rebateGrab and SimplyGo ($300) get 8.33% rebate.And total spend just nice reach $500 mark for UOB One card as well as UOB One account bonus interest.If this is spending pattern is not using UOB One card  then we should never use UOB One card ever~~ 😂Anyway you can calculate how much cash rebate you will get if you use UOB One card and compare with the miles if you use Lady's + HSBC Rev or UOB PPV. It all depends your own miles valuation.,btohqsg
What is the reward scale that worth ppl paying the fee for? I totally dont get how it works,btohqsg
Does UOB usually waive the credit card annual fees if we submit request?,btohqsg
For card payment via shopback app  does eligible transactions counted in for majority of the credit cards?,btohqsg
Does DCS Ultimate Platinum Mastercard gives cashback for simplygo bus/mrt rides?,btohqsg
"Usually is auto if you hit their eligibility requirements. Else you have to request via their app and see what they say.Chris got rejected for fee waiver before  and he asked to cancel card  they quietly waive the fees.For ""cancellation""  I think still depends whether you're worthy for them to keep you as a customer.",btohqsg
think of it as paying for miles at a discounted rate,btohqsg
Is uob kf 3mpd on top of kris+ app mpd earning?,btohqsg
Hi May  I ask is your problem settle?How long does it take?,btohqsg

Can I verify that paying hsbc credit card bill can only be done by transferring from a hsbc bank acc and via axs? I usually pay my diff bank credit cards by adding as a payee on UOB ibanking and just transferring the amt over  but there are multiple folks here who highlight it doesn’t work in this chat. Just spoke to a CSO and she told me transferring from another bank works so wonder if anyone can give a definitive answer,btohqsg
