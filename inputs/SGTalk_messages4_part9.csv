That’s y they (cpf board) encourage nomination,btohqsg
I m more worried bout the minimum sum though at 30 right now I have the next 25 years ( assuming the gov won’t CX lah) to earn enough hopefully to reach the minimum sum at that time,btohqsg
But even then a few hundred k might sound like peanuts by that time,btohqsg
COVID Party . Maybe should ban these people from getting free medical care,btohqsg
Ya. Maybe by that time  Singapore collapses with all the fake news unchecked,btohqsg
It's based on compound interest what. If your income hits 6k at sooner or later you will be able to hit the Full Retirement Sum for your cohort before 55  and can withdraw the excess thenUnfortunately for housewives people didn't put savings from household allowance in CPF earlier  so now there's a problem,btohqsg
Hahahahah all this calculations are based on current gov increases the past 10 yrs which is pretty accurate coz there was no global health crisis this past decade but I believe for COVID 19 as Long as there is no vaccine n with global recession ongoing it will take more than the next decade for the economy to start picking up again.... with that all said who can predict that the gov will decided on a much higher minimum sum in the future.... of coz this r all hypothetical but thx for the input! It’s comforting to see that the millennials n future generation are taking interest in current affairs,btohqsg
Won’t collapse lah but if the gov continue using pofma to prevent Oppo opinions on certain issues u will have a totalitarian state where the pap rule with an iron fist... rmb history where hitler rule over Germany n they had the secret police in place n back then even w/o internet ppl were encouraged to report any form of dissent,btohqsg
I have nth against the pap but I do not like the way they have used the laws based on their needs or in their favour..... the way pofma was used in this election it was like free will on who will be charged or not based on what “they” tot as false not what is ACTUALLY false,btohqsg
You have nothing against the pap except pofma?  You sound as if they have been all good except one tiny speck  but they have been repeating and repeating the same kind of big brother bullying tactics for the past 50 years  you ignore all those?,btohqsg
Not in the way that u think I m most definitely not pro pap but nether m I pro Oppo I tend to be 1 of those sitting on the fence type but I do tend to keep myself up to date bout several issues i.e. watch live debates in parliament amongst other things. although mayb I have not express myself well n I do have issues with the gov but pofma is one of many including the reserved presidency.... I think almost every1 in this grp can agree that gutter politics is outdated n would like to see a clean campaign rather than 1 of smearing which happen a lot during this GE which is y I mention pofma earlier,btohqsg
There are no live debates in Parliament to watch fyi,btohqsg

POFMA for fake news. If real facts  no need to worry 😂,btohqsg
Like if your body parts are realNo need to worry,btohqsg
i have seen finance company trying to do that for their employeesthey painted it as a long term service bonus  holding on to it investing for them.,btohqsg
cant. ppl can easily just change company. citizenship not as easy to change.,btohqsg
Touch your heart. The pofma issues were actually false. No? So far I've not seen the gov use it on something that's said and is true yet...,btohqsg
All the electric source is from SP Power  you mean which is giving the best rates.ISwitch offers the best rate today. But I went for Kepple electric cos I hedge for 3 years fixed price. Cos I forsee fuel prices will surge again when the economy improves.All other electric providers only offer a max of 2 years.,btohqsg
Never give free gifts like free surface pro for subscribing their power plan?,btohqsg
Can wait another quarter also can,btohqsg
Anyone knows if karaoke is open yet?,btohqsg
What do the government do with our cpf?,btohqsg
"Guess I am late on this.  I just saw a re-post article (reposted by Logan Lim) of a pap supporter (name not given) who have read an article called ""I am Sengkang voter""  and the pap supporter shared his own reflections.So I search for this article ""I am Sengkang voter"" and found it  written by Mandy Teo.Both articles are good reads.",btohqsg
don't xia suey yourself. what he say is budget neutral means gahmen no need pay which is consistent with what he say. consumers pay higher price and earn more. money flow faster. too bad people like you never study economics just rant off.,btohqsg
Saw this in another group chat .. why influezer now promoting to be sugar babe ah,btohqsg
Not many influencers can earn $$. They only earn if they are engaged by companies if not they do earn at all. It is getting more competitive now as well. Seems like many people want to be influencers.,btohqsg
Don’t know who xia suey! Don’t know Economics and policies. Read carefully 😂,btohqsg
For Singaporeans to get a returns of up to 6%.  So much better than putting into banks with interest rates of 0.1%,btohqsg
Does anyone know how do i check my ntuc referral code?,btohqsg
I also agree that Jamus was only saying the WP manifesto is budget neutral for the government  not necessarily for Singaporeans  foreigners  SMCs and MNCs. Especially the top 10%The focus on budget neutral for the government is because the opposition is always asked to define how to find the money for increased social spending  despite having incomplete data to work with without FOIA,btohqsg
Yes ... so I think it’s good,btohqsg
Please look at the picture posted properlyNo one said it was not budget neutralONLY Jamus Lim forgotten to tell the voters before elections that the voters will pay instead of the government.Anyways I am not the one who did the poster. Jamus Lim is the originator of the sentences,btohqsg
It's budget neutral for the Budget  full stop.Other details in the manifesto increase revenue through progressive taxation.,btohqsg
It translate the cost to all consumers. FULL 🛑,btohqsg
If Jamus Lim dares to say it  why are you denying it ?,btohqsg
It's 3/4 btw. I'm only pointing out that the focus is on budget neutral for the government.Other WP proposals include free public transport for seniors  more university places for Singaporeans  universal lease buyback for HDB  and no GST hike.WP proposals increase employment opportunities while keeping overall costs low. Reducing reliance on cheap foreign manpower also keeps prices low for locals.,btohqsg
But they didn’t say who is going to pay?Increase income tax for all Singaporeans?OrIncrease company tax ?Increase employment opportunities overseas because MNCs find Singapore too expensive to invest in?  Now many companies are shifting to Malaysia port and they began to fight with Singapore PSA.Many companies like Data Centre and IBM are thinking to shift to Vietnam and India because Singapore Labour is getting too expensive.Another group pf companies are going to China!Yippee! Increase salaries for all Singaporeans! In the Air🤣🤣Talk is easy! Tell us how to do it! Show us the statistics!Economist right! My foot! I did my thesis in Economics also Do you know there is a dominant data and a dynamic data? Do you know what data does Jamus Lim used? Past Expired Data!Come on. This are lives that you are playing with! Lives of Singaporeans!,btohqsg
I am trying to be nice but I amNot stupid,btohqsg
Enjoy the raraBut rememberThe lives of many Singaporeans are at stakeEnjoy the fun,btohqsg
I think you are blowing it totally out of proportion. As Jamus said  the increase in prices due to min wage is likely to be quite small because it is spread over many people.  Yee JJ mentioned that a survey done has found that most people are agreeable to a small price increase to help the very low income people get a decent living wage.People are agreeable to GST increase to 9% which is a very big increase so no reason to complain about a very small increase to help the poor.To me a more relevant thing to complain is the very big fat millions dollar salaries of the top people  why complain about a small increase for the very poor?  It is ok to get millions salary and not ok to get $1300?,btohqsg
Anyone knows of any other talk cock channel?,btohqsg
Worker’s Party proposed this salary if you don’t know2010  MP salary was $10k  WP proposed an increase and wow  it increase to $16K.And the ministers’ salary increase was comparable what WP proposed!If they proposed it and you voted for it  be nice to the increase too,btohqsg
Guys. Use this channel to get laid pls.,btohqsg
If we wan info? We can either wiki or google de,btohqsg
As far I remember  WP was saying that pap way of pegging ministerial salary to top private earners is excessive  so they proposed an alternative formula but then pap pointed out that wp formula works out to be same amount. For sure I would disagree with such amount  it does seem like WP is not aware  maybe they are working with insufficient info  in any case I would disagree with such high salaries.,btohqsg
But as far as giving a minimum living wage to the bottom income earners  I would agree with it  in fact even pap agrees with it  just that their way of implementation is different.,btohqsg
