This friend I had very into the Thai amulets and all his thick necklace held about 6 amulets ah but an incident happened where we were eating and talking about this with kumanthongs and all cuz I really don‚Äôt know much so I wanna find out moreThis pastor from new creation or something overheard from table next to us chimed in saying all these are make believe the bible and Jesus Christ is the only correct way to heaven  the kumanthongs along with other Thai beings are just statues that people worship for nothing and the amulets is all for show only so on,btohqsg
I never say anything cuz idk how to react and My friend damn pissed off,btohqsg
few days later I hear from my relatives who i think know him say that he in hospital very serious,btohqsg
Basically the pastor was being disrespectful lah,btohqsg
Hehehe I need go out for a little while,btohqsg
The following week I asked them if they got the picture of the pastor or not how is he?,btohqsg
they showed me the photo and it‚Äôs that guy  they said don‚Äôt know why cannot get better but only worse the doctor also dk don‚Äôt understand,btohqsg
the pastor who insulted my friend,btohqsg
Need to take steps to see view. Cos Christians got many type. Maybe this pastor he is the more responsible type and he wanna set things right no matter the circumstances  according to his belief.,btohqsg
If not coincidence  which do ur believe? That the amulets are powerful to protect the wearer? Or that the pastor's claim that it is the devil's work?Disclaimer: for discussion only.,btohqsg
No lah I told them what really happened and they ofcourse defended him but I told them it‚Äôs not too late to tell his family and see if they wanna do anything about it? Because at this point  they‚Äôve got nothing to lose and try every way to get him back even if it‚Äôs stupid and illogical,btohqsg
So end of the day...if U stand by the fence type...U believe what U wanna believe. If U are the one involved  U also believe what U believe in.,btohqsg
They dismissed me at first until he kept getting worse day after day and they still dk why but I think the family visited the Temple at Bukit Merah with fruit basket and apologised for whatever he did or at least that‚Äôs what I overheard if my ears are working fine,btohqsg
Every religion has their beliefs & there‚Äôs so much wonders in the universe. One should nvr be disrespectful or diss another belief even if you don‚Äôt believe.,btohqsg
At least not this openly ba. But as I said  that pastor did what he believed is right. But end of the day...well  everyone held accountable to some actions,btohqsg
This topic can go forever one haha,btohqsg
So let's go on to....what's for lunch,btohqsg
It's burger king for me (hence I referenced burger king CEO),btohqsg
Reminds me of jeanna commented on the hdb void deck got sell amulet or what de.üòÅ,btohqsg
