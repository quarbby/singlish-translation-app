Calculus is kinda dead ish but not rlly,btohqsg
ah yea which isn't a bad thing for scoring,btohqsg
it gets less dead when you find more applications,btohqsg
you can't just forget someone. more of getting things going with your life as usual regardless,btohqsg
and less then 30 are active,btohqsg
my number of brain cells left,btohqsg
Maju  wah that's so long ago,btohqsg
I think h2 math is definitely harder than that  that one probably at most secondary level,btohqsg
Oh ok then is it like you canâ€™t finish the quiz because the Econs concepts are harder to understand?,btohqsg
Not so much because of the math,btohqsg
H2 Maths is easy.It's dead. Which means you work hard sure can do,btohqsg
What's hard: You work very hard still cannot do,btohqsg
It is because im not fast enough w the math  but actually that was one quiz only la  coz it is 15qns 25min,btohqsg
however  hard work is subjective. I have seen students working 2 weeks before A levels  and claimed they worked hard for it but still fail,btohqsg
i feel like maths very abstract  u just drill and drill but u dont know what u are doing,btohqsg
Actually for micro econs  most are jc stuff except a few add on and the math,btohqsg
That's A level.Like me hor  I may have been among top 10 scorers in A level Physics in 2001 (still humble bragging oops)but I know most of my current knowledge came way after A levels. And I realised so many things I thought I knew at A levels  were actually not correct.I was one who didn't know what I was doing.,btohqsg
Meanwhile i actually dk HOW i slept until 10.30,btohqsg
Omg that was the yr i was bornðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
didnt take o lvls  but it was only in uni where i learn how and why different equations and theories are like that,btohqsg
which means to say  for O and A levels  just drill and make sure answering techniques are there  you could do pretty well without 100% understanding what's happening.,btohqsg
because they gave some real world applications for it,btohqsg
I took H1 physics and always top it but i feel it is easier than O level physicsðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Or maybe it is just me drilling,btohqsg
Eh actually this is very true leh  like chem n phy i can drill to get v high,btohqsg
But definitely cant happen in uni,btohqsg
But tbh w/o the understanding it is also hard to drill tho,btohqsg
Wait ur sch only had 1 A or how did they determine the top 10,btohqsg
no  this is for entire Singapore,btohqsg
top 10 scorers for A lvl Physics,btohqsg
Like if u ask me  if i dun understand  it is q hard to push me to do papersOk but tbh A level stuff is pretty easy to understand,btohqsg
I dun care if i understand,btohqsg
I just whack formula for math,btohqsg
Ohâ€¦i guess they stop that coz â€˜a move away fr gradesâ€™ lol,btohqsg
few years ago they stop  I think around covid time,btohqsg
I think it has not been there for very long alr,btohqsg
After 2013 they kinda stopped all the shit,btohqsg
bruhh wtff my ppd grp go kick me out say i nvr do work,btohqsg
then now my cher say vv messy,btohqsg
cuz they nvr tell him they tht kicking me out,btohqsg
i gna join another grp but cher say he cnnt confirm the change untill after holiday,btohqsg
istg if they rly sabo me say i nvr do work,btohqsg
even if i rly got do,btohqsg
Are u not close to the group then they just want sabo,btohqsg
but my cher now talking to them,btohqsg
Oh hopefully the teacher can talk sense into them,btohqsg
ya but rn he hearing frm both sides,btohqsg
I failed math prelims  spammed math TYS and prelim qns for one month then got A for a levels  so quite sure most ppl can get A for h2 math if they just set their mind on doing it,btohqsg
Tbh not everyone hv the skills but i heard ppl drilling to an A also,btohqsg
But it is those content subjects that can really be drilled,btohqsg
