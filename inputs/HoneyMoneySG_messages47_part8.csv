"I realised this is not necessarily true.The SMS whether it mentioned ""if you have previously registered"" appears intermittently. Just take it as a gentle reminder without it necessarily meaning anything.I know because my humans who were all 'brand new' to the cycle  some got this phrase some didn't.The most reliable is always to use your own Excel to record your participation month details.",btohqsg
I registered once only in apr2023 last month,btohqsg
if you want confirmation  best is contact your RM. He/She can see your participation cycle.,btohqsg
Then all good for the bonus interest in Apr to Jul cycle.,btohqsg

Hi. I saw on the UOB One Card Exclusions list that Transit link is one of the items. Does it mean that we cant get the One Account bonus interest for our bus/mrt rides ?,btohqsg
TRANSIT* refers to topup on CEPAS cards.If you use SimplyGo (tap the One Card or Apple/Google/Samsung Pay etc)  it's coded as BUS/MRT*  counted.This qn has been asked and answered a lot of times afaik.,btohqsg
one more reason - is it possible your transaction is $50 but net payment charge to card is less than $50 due to deduct using mile ?,btohqsg
haha i m not too sure either. the CSO has replied to my email  so i will just provide proof etc  and see what they say. they are quite fast in replying to emails  maybe it is an easy qn... lol,btohqsg
Anyone knows if annual fee can be waived for Citi premier miles card although not much spending will be made (<50 per month). Thinking of applying for the priority pass 😬,btohqsg
Will there be fall below fee in June in your example?,btohqsg
If premier ega account  no fall below fee. For personal banking ega account by right have fall below fee but by left the bank may not charge it. Even if charged $5 fall below fee  the interest earned for $2k savings across 3-4 months will be more than $5.,btohqsg
