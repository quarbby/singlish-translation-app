When it comes to choosing a good Personal Project (PW) idea for A-levels  consider selecting a topic that aligns with your interests  allows for in-depth exploration  and showcases your skills and knowledge. Here are some potential PW ideas across different subjects:1.STEM (Science  Technology  Engineering  and Mathematics):   - Design and construct a small-scale renewable energy system  such as a solar-powered charger or a wind turbine.- Investigate the impact of various factors on plant growth  such as different types of soil  light exposure  or watering schedules.2.Social Sciences:   - Conduct a sociological study on the effects of social media on mental health among teenagers.- Analyze the correlation between socioeconomic status and academic achievement in your local community.3.Humanities:   - Create a historical documentary exploring a significant event or period in your country's history.- Write and perform a dramatic monologue from the perspective of a character in a classic novel  exploring themes and character motivations.4.Languages:   - Produce a series of short stories or poems in a foreign language  focusing on cultural themes or personal experiences.- Create a language-learning app or website aimed at helping beginners grasp basic vocabulary and grammar rules.5.Arts:   - Develop a portfolio of artwork exploring a specific theme or concept  such as identity  environmentalism  or urban landscapes.- Choreograph and perform a dance piece that communicates a message or tells a story related to a social or cultural issue.6.Business and Economics:- Conduct a market research study to identify consumer preferences and trends in a specific industry.   - Develop a business plan for a socially responsible enterprise  addressing environmental sustainability and community impact.7.Health and Medicine:- Investigate the efficacy of various mindfulness techniques in reducing stress and anxiety levels among students.   - Design and conduct an experiment to analyze the effects of different diets on physical health and well-being.Remember to choose a topic that you are passionate about and that allows for meaningful exploration and analysis. Additionally  ensure that your PW idea aligns with the requirements and guidelines set by your school or exam board.,btohqsg
There I done it for you,btohqsg
This is the last batch afaik,btohqsg
i tot pass/fail starts this yr,btohqsg
I mean still need to do ig.. Idk i didnt do it. Private Candidate perks,btohqsg
Dont have to report PW grades if you don't have it... Big brain time,btohqsg
But but here's the thing   now or rather at least here in MI  normally we take PW in y2 rite so if your PW fail in y2  then you'll have to take it in y3 just to pass it( that's assuming you'll make it to y3 otherwise idk what happens if u retain la tbf) and you'll be taking it ALONE....individually...no group or anything ... Also if you were to fail   it'll pop up as a black dash in your results slip which won't look nice,btohqsg
y3 is when we take GP along w 3 H2s sooo yea,btohqsg
I mean that's the issue of being only 1 of 209 ppl,btohqsg
There's only 209 or about 8 classes in MI for PU3 and that's about it,btohqsg
MI is often seen as a dumping ground for those who cmi for JC but still want that system,btohqsg
Eh rlly lol idk that much stats tbf,btohqsg
Yeah I mean compared to the 12k+ ppl taking Alevels in JC2,btohqsg
