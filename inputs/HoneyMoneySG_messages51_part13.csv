Under UOB One account  does the $500 credit card spend to qualify for higher interest goes by spending in the calendar month or billing month?,btohqsg
Thanks Chris korkor but I no expert  can ask if needed here :),btohqsg
Is the UOB one effective interest rate still 5% at 100k? The new tier says 7.8% but clause still put max is 5%,btohqsg
still effectively 5% p.a. if you have EXACTLY $100 000.00 everyday in the month.,btohqsg
So the 7.8% tier can‚Äôt be hit?,btohqsg
u already said it is tier.. it is what pulls up the average to be overall 5% p.a.,btohqsg
Hi does anyone have any apps to recommend to track multiple credit card spendings (trying to optimise the rewards cap per CC) i tried awardwallet  but they seem to need my ibanking details which im skeptical about,btohqsg
My wife signed up in Apr and just received the SMS. It does take a while.,btohqsg
The card luggage. How long does it take for approval,btohqsg
I used manual way  calculate and jot down in notes. The better and safer way. My spending track app will track the actual spending but the cap for each card  i calculate my own.,btohqsg
Thanks. I received sms on the $200 cashback but not the luggage. So was worried that I might miss something,btohqsg
i wanted to create an excel sheet to multiply accordingly HAHA but it sounds like alot of effort + i've no idea if my calculations are gona be right,btohqsg
I thought it's cashback or luggage? I don't think you get both.,btohqsg
There are 2 gifts I think. $150 cashback or luggage. And another one is $200 gift for signing up revo card and Ega account,btohqsg
Normally for me ill start track when mid month especially when my credit card near 1k or i know i gonna pay something huge in adv,btohqsg
