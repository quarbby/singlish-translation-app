Anyone sign up for a standard chartered journey card ? Were you auto tied up to Allianz Insurance? I signed up for this card and I opened the approval pdf doc. I got a shock when I saw that I'm included for insurance and talk about some 14 day cooling periods and if I didn't want the insurance  I need to contact  Allianz directly.,btohqsg
Yes you can  but there could be processing charges so would be good to check before going down to the branch. I last tried to deposit a USD cheque at the branch which they accepted  but the charges didn‚Äôt make sense so ended up just depositing to a US account instead.,btohqsg
Noted. Thanks for the advice üôè,btohqsg

For the ocbc 360 account  anybody tried using the fast transfer salary in Aug and didn't get the iaalary nterest? I didn't get it. I called the cso and she said fund transfer won't work,btohqsg
It stopped working already. salary transfer from corp acct only.,btohqsg
So paynow transfer with fast no longer valid?,btohqsg
Anyway maybe soon all this will collapse when us fed starts cutting rates.See rates nerf first or method nerf first Loh,btohqsg
UOB seems to start nerfing. Interest cut then Evo (cashback) then amaze (miles).,btohqsg
Just don‚Äôt cut effectively before December please. That‚Äôs when first round plunging chicken ends.I predict I probably won‚Äôt do 2025 round Liao. Sure lousy,btohqsg
Did anyone have a credit card limit reduced limit by more than 50% with DBS bank ? I had a salary increase and I submitted for a credit limit review.Instead of increasing the limit  they reduced the limit. I submitted my salary pay slip and they said it's not enough and still need to submit a cpf statement. I told them to forget it. They can reduce my limit by a further of 75% if they are not satisfied with the current 50% reduction.,btohqsg
Odd. My review with them went smoothly and they increased my limit. Why didn't you submit the documents that dbs asked for?,btohqsg
If never use the credit card for prolong time. Will the bank cancel deactivate the card? Will affect credit score?,btohqsg
Is your current credit limit before cut more than 4 times of your monthly fixed salary?,btohqsg
My thought is DBS does not work now? with FAST transfer as well?,btohqsg
If your salary is higher annually based on CPF statement  they would increase it. Why not just submit it?,btohqsg
I already submitted the salary pay slip. They were not satisfied with it and wanted more supporting documents like the cpf statement (which was not asked in the first email).I told them that I don't have time for this and become sarcastic to them. If you are not happy with the current 50% limit reduction  I give you permission to reduce it by 75% . Are you happy now ? I ended the email saying have a good day.,btohqsg
Through GIRO still ok based on dp. MaybeLawrencecan update us on his attempt? üëçüèª,btohqsg
I was annoyed that they reduced my limit the first time. After submitting the needed documents eg payslip. They sent another email asking for cpf statement. Made me more annoyed.,btohqsg
Why would they cancel it? They get to charge annual fee happily.,btohqsg
Is payment via NUH app qualifying for UOB One?,btohqsg
Ok we understand that u are upset but firstly bank already clearly stated when u submit for review it can go up or down (which is always why I never disturb my limits that I‚Äôm happy with already  nor do cancel and reapply ntb stuff).That being said banks are constantly adapting to regulatory changes and I believe one of the common methods being used these days is the total credit limits approved by all banks towards u  especially if annual income under $120k.So there could be a situation where Dbs feels u already have too much limits approved by other banks so they reduce u.Also there could be circumstances that u or us don‚Äôt know affecting the banks decision.So don‚Äôt take it personally and certainly don‚Äôt argue or be sarcastic to the bank. Be cooperative as they have every right to terminate the relationship without giving u any reason.,btohqsg
You may want to clarify is for spend or cashback?,btohqsg
How many years you have account in DBS? I submitted for credit limit review recently n also requested by DBS bank to submit payslip n CPF statement. They increase my credit limit to more than 4 times of monthly salary after they see my payslip n CPF statements.,btohqsg
hi gurus  need some advice..currently have amaze + CRMC & OCBC Infinity. still havent decided if i want to go cashback or miles. my monthly spending on card is probably < 300.also  im trying to rack up the sign up free gifts from singsaver/moneysmart.intend to spend about 2.5k on apple products. any suggestion for cards to get?i do like SC Smart CC as i could use that for it's 6% merchants eg transport  subway  yakun  etc. so i could hit the 500 within 30 days for thatam looking to open HSBC EGA too  not an existing customer too. i saw HSBC Live+ Card toothank you,btohqsg
Is your job a fixed salary one with no variation month to month?,btohqsg
Not tried yet. Been a little busy and lazy üòÇ,btohqsg
I'm ok if they want to terminate our relationship. In Singapore there are many banks. But I appreciate the advice bro. Thank you.,btohqsg
think hard to get enough miles to redeem flight with the low spending  so go with cashback bah.live+ need min 600 spend in a month consistently so probably not suitable for uapple product maybe use citi smrt on kris+ via istudio,btohqsg
Dbs may be full of nonsense but I can tell u having a Dbs relationship is actually very useful.,btohqsg
Hi You‚Äôre currently using one of the best solutions for no/low minimum spend with Amaze Citi Rewards at 4mpd or 2.27% cash back.SC Smart is also great but very specific and you do get 5.6mpd or 6% cash back no min on specific spend. Just use it mainly for the categories and charge the rest to Amaze Citi Rewards until your expenses slowly increase to about $1k per month.Then adopt a card with higher Cashback if it is your thing. 4mpd with a $1k limit via amaze Citi rewards is as good as it gets right now.EGA is always good to have but remember to do the Everyday program for the extra perks every 2 months.,btohqsg
Huh ? Really ? Ok I'm not sarcastic now. But could you tell me why ? lol I'm curious,btohqsg
Most atmsCompetitive housing loansAccess to priority and private bankingAnd the tips and tricks shared in this chat a number need Dbs,btohqsg
I'm keeping my dbs relationship. It helps consolidate things quite a bit for me. üòÅ,btohqsg
They have only 3 DBS treasures branches. When compared to UOB privilege  UoB privileges lounge has more. Loan wise I don't know coz I didn't take loan before,btohqsg
Dbs yuu card. 18% cashback. How can u say no,btohqsg
Huh ? That card can get access to DBS treasures lounge ? I'm a little confused here. There are only 3 Treasures lounge - MBFC   Taka  and at Siglap. Compared to UOB Privilege lounge (definitely more than 3)   so DBS has less lounges,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is an amazing account. üëçüèª,btohqsg
1. Access to priority banking and private banking refers to the products and investments u can access. Compared to Uob and Ocbc (not Bos) their offerings are superior2. Dbs yuu credit card is the only card that can give u 18% cashback at dairy farm.,btohqsg
Anybody buying iPhone to flip this year ? Any market demand ?,btohqsg
Dbs got many useful credit cards.,btohqsg
With the nerf to amaze from uob  dbs cards seem not as bad ü•≤,btohqsg
Thanks for this! Will take a look at the cardIf it‚Äôs redeeming miles for economy seats in SIA is it still worth it? And taking into account my monthly card spending amount. I understand miles is not for the lazy üòÇ and gotta queue to buy too.. maybe I should just do cashback,btohqsg
This part I agree with you. I am currently using the altitude card which has no miles expiry. But sure if they didn't like my sarcastic email   they can terminate our relationship lol üòÜ I'm really ok. I am now looking at UOB PRIV.,btohqsg
Consolidate and go biz saver bro. Economy dollar per mile value is quite low  around $0.80 to $1 only.Biz class can be around $1.50 onwards üòä,btohqsg
I don't think demand is as big.,btohqsg

i'd like to preorder an iphone tonight (i think the watch can wait) but i havent selected a card to apply yet. plus it's gonna cost 1899. thinking of how best i can maximise + free giftsconsidering preorder = online and can't split the bill into multiple cards to pay,btohqsg
Citi Smart. I think Apple website considered online üòä,btohqsg
Best is prob dbs wwmc or Citi smrt for cashback. Not sure you have enough time for that.,btohqsg
i doubt i have the time!,btohqsg
Do you have existing Citi card? May get digital card immediately and ready to use from the app,btohqsg
Citi SMRT has a min spend of 500 a month. tough to hit it on my own. im looking at SC Smart for 6% CB on transport and other included merchants. but not very wise to spend 1899 on that card just for sign up free gift,btohqsg
I got my crmc approved in 3min and added to amaze and use right away üòÖ,btohqsg
yeah Anthony i do have CRMC and amaze. oh yeah! i could use CRMC and pay to get 2.27% or 4mpd,btohqsg
How long does UOB take to approve cards? (first time and no uob account),btohqsg
Frankly  not just for Apple  for other phone manufacturers  the difference in features is not worth to upgrade. My view is we will upgrade phones every 3-6 years  so I want to focus on phone hardware reliability and software support. Of course  the ecosystem matters.,btohqsg
Capped at 1k and you likely want to preserve crmc for other spends.,btohqsg
oh.. i thought the cap is only at Amaze's end? let me revisit CRMC t&cs again,btohqsg
No harm trying to apply Citi smrt from the app.600/m500/m spend is easily hit by 1 899 iphone.,btohqsg
My first card (UOB prvi) took about 5 working days.,btohqsg
You only need $500 spend when you need 5% cash back bro.Just keep the $12k limit per year until your next big spend.,btohqsg
i see! honestly  500 is kind of tough if i were to use it alone. even in my household might not be that easy. will do some calculationsthinking if 5% of 1899 is worth min spend of 500 a month for the next year.,btohqsg
Lawrence  sorry i dont quite get the 12k limit?,btohqsg
You don't need to spend 500 every month. Just spend 95 in the next statement so it can be offset by cashback,btohqsg
There is an annual limit to the card of $12k for 5% cash back.So don‚Äôt put more than $12k spend a year on this card.Good thing is if online and hit >= $500  can get 5% cash back from it on the months that you need it.,btohqsg
thanks both for your replies! okay i will have to look into the card to see how the cashback system works.,btohqsg

I tell you all. I am very fed up of having to constantly educate the KFC cashiers that Trust Cashback card has a $5 off $40 promo (improved version of the $2 off $20 promo which is made into a standee).So many times I show the cashier this screenshot from Trust website and they say CANNOT USE and we have to call the Manager to make a call  who thankfully would already agree with my screenshot which is so clear.Can you all also try to keep using this promo so KFC would be more aware!! Apparently  KFC management DID NOT send out any email notification on this $5 off $40 promo.THANKS!,btohqsg
Jialat  I only have KFC in Malaysia,btohqsg
can order for dine in/takeaway thru their website  no need to deal w cashier,btohqsg

Is it worth getting the new Trust Cashback card if I only exclusively use the card for NTUC groceries? Doesn't seem like there is a category for it.Also the $350 & $700 spend to unlock bonuses for me is usually a mixture of expenditure and not in any specific category.,btohqsg

Already waited 4y. A few more months won't die one lah,btohqsg
but what's the max cap for the smart card tho? $818?,btohqsg
the cap is for bonus pts. u get no bonus pts for this purchase  so u can still get 6% cashback on $818 of spend monthly,btohqsg
the delivery slots available right now are still within the first 2 weeks of release for the pro/maxes,btohqsg

cancel it and order for delivery‚Ä¶ at most u wait 1-2 weeks more only. then u standby on release day if u die die must have it that day to see if they have extra stock for pickup  sometimes will have one,btohqsg
Oh take it as a lesson fee. Keep the order and enjoy yr new phone,btohqsg

I actually just received my EVOL renewal card then I went to kay poh read up again (i earlier condemned this card).Since Amaze is going to be nerfed with UOB cards from 1st October  I have a contrarian view on how to use UOB Evol.What about this: $800 entirely as a General Spend Card when OVERSEAS$300 ApplePay/Topup Suica$500 Paywave PHYSICAL CardOverall it will earn $50.9 / $800 = 6.36% cashback - 4% FX Costs = 2.36% Net Positive BenefitSlightly better than UOB Visa Signature (1.5 cents miles valuation) = 4 miles x 1.5 cents - 4% FX Cost = 2% Net Positive Benefit,btohqsg
What's the cap of UOB evol?,btohqsg
cashback is capped at $80  but not economical to hit that..should be aiming for the sweet spot $50which you can hit with MINIMUM $300 online/applepay + $200 foreign currency spend.remaining $300 can be anything.so at minimum if you spend everything overseas (with minimum $300 applepay)  you can hit $50/$800 = 6.25% cashback - 4% FX Fee = 2.25% net positive benefit (BETTER THAN UOB VS),btohqsg
But what if you are just using the card for local spend and no fx spend?,btohqsg
oh no no.. I am exploring from Foreign Spending angle only... since Amaze + UOB dying ... i thought UOB Evol could make an interesting additionfor local SGD... boo to UOB Evol... DEAD... (but if you are going overseas  you can considering using the $300 locally),btohqsg
Death of Amaze + UOB forcing me to think out of the box la...,btohqsg
i currently use credit card to pay public transport  is there any benefit to adding the card to simplygo? other than transaction history,btohqsg
As a biggest use factor  UOB Evol can cover overseas purchases at Nuts  Confectionary Shops (MCC 5441) which are almost always NOT included in any White List of the cards I use. It is not dining!,btohqsg

Hi Gurus  I need some advice.I'm currently using the Citi Rewards card paired with Amaze for miles chasing  along with the UOB One Savings Account and UOB One Credit Card. My spending mostly consists of food and beverage (FnB) and shopping  amounting to about $700 total per month.I‚Äôve noticed that the OCBC 360 Account offers a higher interest rate compared to the UOB One Savings Account and am considering making the switch.

hi guruss For HSBC Everyday Global Account.there are 2 interest rate type:Bonus Interest Rate : 3.25%Total interest Rate on Incremental ADB : 3.3%am i right to say  as long as i put money inside is a sure to get 3.25%? <---- not fresh fund.if i deposit 20k inside. i will get 3.3% for this 20k? <---- fresh fund.,btohqsg
You need to understand why the bank uses the term called reference month.,btohqsg
Mean the 10k won‚Äôt get anything?,btohqsg
Burning question.Why bank don‚Äôt use $0 leh?Why must $10 000 ah?,btohqsg
Just an update  the CSO called me and couldn‚Äôt provide me a valid reason why the bonus UNI$ was not credited also lol. But they will check my transaction and reward me accordingly.,btohqsg
So those with UOB bonus UNI$ not credited  do check your UNI$ statement!,btohqsg
Never explain why bank use $10 000 instead of $0 for less confusion.Weird right. So many people confused.,btohqsg
Read the description of the line items $190 000,btohqsg
only incremental monthly average balance wrt reference month gets the bonus 3.25%,btohqsg
So the 10k is 0.05% or 3.25% ah?,btohqsg
I know.Why don‚Äôt use $10 or $100 leh?,btohqsg
depends what is the monthly average balance of the reference monthly10k is just an example in the screenshot,btohqsg
Ya you know what I‚Äôm asking.Why don‚Äôt hsbc just use $0.Won‚Äôt that be clearer? ü§£,btohqsg
Can i check now UOB one account nerfed  then what account you guys using?,btohqsg
what is the issue with putting 10k as example? it is to illustrate what is incremental balance,btohqsg
I feel $0 look better.So people won‚Äôt bring that $10 000 into asking what about the $10 000 leh  got interest? ü§£,btohqsg
I guess if you have $0 inside you would likely have to pay the fall below fees,btohqsg
already clearly indicate 10k is balance of reference month mah,btohqsg
"Starting with $0 may confuse people.Becos an example using ""$0 to $100k""  will have1. Incremental = $100k2. Final balance = $100kThen when the bonus calculation use  ""$100k""  people might be unsure is it the incremental or the ADB being used",btohqsg

Just sharing for my opinion - Actually to be honest   I've been using DBS Altitude for many years. I don't know if DBS awarded miles to me correctly or not. Eg welcome sign up or for daily use.  I am just not bothered to check statements.In addition  I am planning to sign up for UOB PRVI.  According to tips from members here. I need to purchase tickets from dedicated UOB websites from Agoda or Expedia to enjoy 6 milesThe problem is I cannot select seats using the UOB Expedia travel page. I did a test booking. From Singapore to Tokyo via a transfer at Bangkok with Thai Airways on Expedia UOB. I am not given the option of seats selection.I will just book direct from the Thai airways website. I can choose my seats. I'm not bothered about the 6 miles.,btohqsg

Cant check individual trnx anymore. Have to use spreadsheet to manually track,btohqsg
It starts the moment you create the account. The guaranteed interest is 4.2% pa.So if you created the account at 11pm  once it clicks into midnight  the first interest will be deposited.,btohqsg
so just put in 20k then ok already?,btohqsg
Put 19.5k or something similar. Once u go above 20k  your amount can go down. üòÖ,btohqsg
Yes. I will keep the account at no more than $20k though as advised by Chris in his latest video,btohqsg
sorry i'm new to investing. but the money will be credited into the acc daily?,btohqsg

gg i will miss 1 day already.,btohqsg
If you any how bomb  other people will also anyhow bomb you. üòÜ,btohqsg
1 day is not much if you‚Äôre putting anything under $20k as advised. Better late than never though üëçüèª,btohqsg
i will follow like what they say to put in $19.5k as i initially wanted to put in $20k straight,btohqsg
Yea I think $19.5k leaves enough room ($500) to maximise ur interest earnings cos anything above $20k gives a different rate,btohqsg

Hey Thank you for your reply ! The reason I ask is because Endowus states fund fee 0.21 - trailer fee 0.08 = 0.13% (fund fees after cashback) then I checked moomoo it states management fees 0.16% + admin fees / performance fee / trust fee (refer to product sheet).  Then I went to see the product sheet it is so vague ‚Ä¶ the fees state up to 0.1% ‚Ä¶ what does that even mean lol,btohqsg
At least we agar agar know how much. But if buy thru moomoo the fees are quite opaque‚Ä¶ haha but yea la in the grand scheme if the amount invested is small it is likely negligible. What is your own practice ? üò¨,btohqsg
Endowus for cpf. Others   buy myself via tiger/moo moo if money market funds.,btohqsg

When you setup the payment  you will need to tell CardUp or iPayMy when the payment needs to be in by. They will charge your card the appropriate number of days ahead they need to make it happen. Please review and make sure some of the payments don‚Äôt end up on Saturdays  those are iffy and you should manually pull those forward to Friday to avoid problems.You can do a mix of cash back and miles.

You are letting go of 5% cashback for 4mpd.,btohqsg
But cash back won‚Äôt get so much as price of air ticket right?,btohqsg
They just illustrating a point that it‚Äôs not free cause you can get cashback if u use a cashback card,btohqsg
Erhm you spend 12k a year  5% cashback is 600 and it's enough to get an economy flight to Taiwan too. üòÅ,btohqsg
That's the calculation that has to be done,btohqsg
Not everything. There are exclusions clauses. Some are excluded. It is stated in the TnC.,btohqsg

if you tell IBKR that you want to deposit xx amount of SGD ( I highly suggest you do  easier to track in case of any issues)  they will provide you bank transfer details. These should be the citibank details in SG. Transfer to this account is free for you,btohqsg

Hello all - sorry a bit of a noob question..Thinking of pairing dbs vantage with cardup - I understand only rental transactions will count towards the initial qualifying spend of $4k within 30days. Does this also apply to the 60k spend in one year for the following year waiver ?,btohqsg
Other cardup trnx will qualify for 60k  not only rentalz,btohqsg
Ah ok..cos I looked at the exclusion list and it has things like school fees or car/housing loan repayments so didn‚Äôt think they would be eligible for the 60k yearly spend,btohqsg
Most of cardup trnx will be 7399 so eligible for 60k spend but not welcome bonus. Cardup rental has different mcc so eligible for both 60k and welcome bonus.,btohqsg
Hi all  another noob question. New to the Kris+ with credit card combo. Can I ask  if I wanna use my Citi Rewards MC via Kris+  do I choose Amaze (linked to CRMC) or the CRMC itself on Google Pay to get Kris+ miles and Citi Rewards 4mpd points? (Assuming MCC qualifies),btohqsg
Crmc explicitly excludes apple/google pay so don't even add thar card there. Pair crmc with amaze for Kris+ to circumvent it.,btohqsg

What are the options for new to save on interest? If I refinance  will there be any hidden cost to watch out for?,btohqsg

Hello can I ask whats the best way to clock miles to buy iPhone?Is it linking citirewards with krispay on krishop?,btohqsg
i think it looks decent since 6 month tbills is now 3.10% p.a.no funny conditions.. just make sure you start it on 1st of the month so avoid losing CPF interest,btohqsg
The iPhone cost less than $1000? Citi rewards max $1k only for 4mpd.,btohqsg
Assuming the transfer back to the Ordinary Account is completed in January 2025  these invested funds will earn CPF interest from February as CPF contributions  including refunds  start to earn interest only from the next month.In this case  the member is forgoing about 13 months or S$541.67 in interest if the S$20 000 was left in the CPF Ordinary Account  according to calculations done by Mr Wong. Further delays in the transfer  for example into February  could see the potential loss of another month of CPF interest.Then  there are one-time and recurring fees to be paid to the bank administering your CPF investment account. For example  DBS charges S$2.50 for each fixed deposit transaction and a quarterly service fee of S$2 ‚Äì excluding Goods and Services Tax.Taking these charges into account leaves the CPF member with a S$27 profit from the Maybank fixed deposit.It is still a net gain  so this comes down to whether people find it worthwhile for them to go to the trouble of signing up for the fixed deposit  said Mr Wong.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cpf-fixed-deposit-ordinary-account-funds-4056851,btohqsg

Hi gurus  i have submitted GIRO application with hsbc EGA account to pay for my posb everyday credit card 2 weeks ago  but i just received my dbs statement and due to pay next early next month. Giro application is still in process but shd be set up soon.1. Any possibility that once the giro arrangement is approved  i call in posb to ensure they transact by giro on due date?2. If i miss this payment  and incur late + interest fee  what is the chances of posb waiving the fees? (I know scb is no no  but how is posb?),btohqsg
Giro set up take at least a month. If your next posb card bill did not indicate that it will be deducted by giro  then you definitely must pay manually first,btohqsg
If you already receive statement and it does not say pay by GIRO  then make manual payment as usual,btohqsg
Wah  must remember not to use it then. Thanks üôè,btohqsg
Huh. I tot u should sayOk I will make sure I hit the min spend.,btohqsg
Lol... I can only make it for 1 month the most. So forget it. Stick to amaze+ crmc.,btohqsg
Also need the have min spend of $1 per transaction ü§£,btohqsg
If i miss this manual payment  (incur late fee and interest)  and the statement roll over to next month.2. What is the chance of getting waiver with posb?,btohqsg
Dont. Just pay it. Late fee and interest ain't jokes.,btohqsg
GIRO usually takes about 3-4 months to complete. Merry Christmas to you in advance üéÖ üéÑ.,btohqsg
Until your card statement says that it will be paid with GIRO on the due date  just assume nothing is complete and pay the card manually,btohqsg
Your statement will show if the payment will be deducted via giro. Look out for that.If at the point of statement generation they don‚Äôt have the giro setup  DBS/POSB will not utilise it even if it is setup subsequently.An exception to this is CitiBank. That one you really have to call and find out.,btohqsg
Scb does have alot feedbacks that waiving is/near impossible.But i havent heard of member's waiving experience with posbüòÖ,btohqsg
As advised by us  better don‚Äôt let this happen. There could potentially be trailing interest charges as well. It is going to drive you nuts since each bank also have minimum interest chargeable.You can do a fast transfer on the date due if not deducted if you really want to since most - with qualifier as most  banks have up to 3 days grace period for posting of payment.,btohqsg

Suggests they accept cash but I have my doubts.,btohqsg

Hi new to credit card scene. How does UOB one credit card compared to City Rewards card?,btohqsg
You are comparing chicken to cow. One is for cashback and one is for miles üòÖ,btohqsg
thanks . around $228 per mth  or $7 a day for every 10k,btohqsg
Remember it starts counting from transaction date  not due date.,btohqsg
Those who submitted your CICT rights subscription. Money haven't deduct hor. Weird.,btohqsg
I ever paid 99.6% of my outstanding bill with just 0.4% outstanding due to miscalculation. The bank charged me 5.9% (interest + service fee) of total bills 100%. Luckily bank waived the charges.If your outstanding is $10k  under the same scenario  you will be charged $590 one day after due date.,btohqsg
hmm.. shouldn't the interest and fee be based on what you did not clear off?,btohqsg
I questioned CSO the same. CSO said no  it is total bill.,btohqsg
From my understanding  bank always calc interest based on your total bill  i.e. 100% + 27.8% (not the exact amount) then proceed to waive the 27.8% interest if you pay bill on time. But if you only pay 99.6%  this 27.8% won't be waived and now you own the bank 0.4% + 27.8%. üòÖ,btohqsg
