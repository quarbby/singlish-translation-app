in certain cases ownership is cheaper than rentalbut end of the day taking grab can still be even cheaperall depends on ur priorities,btohqsg
heard all their issues were solved well,btohqsg
theres no rental where u dont require deposit iinw,btohqsg
GetGo is horrendously disgusting or bad condition,btohqsg
Dunno. Don‚Äôt bother to see EV‚Äôs either. They tire me,btohqsg
cos there are ppl who ik who rent getgo? and i‚Äôve sat in them?,btohqsg
be careful renting getgo too  a friend got a warning letter because his father let him driveboth have license but he was not insured by GG,btohqsg
But if you‚Äôre having a service to accomodate others  these are what you will be judged on,btohqsg
it‚Äôs not a by fault basis  it‚Äôs a review,btohqsg
at the time driver not added. iinw it was late night or smtg and his father was js tired,btohqsg
dunno how getgo found out also :),btohqsg
ok la but end of the day;as someone who has this convo at least once a weekCarlite is the best all rounder and the easiest to work with. Price wise & selection can be better but it is the best car sharing platform at the moment,btohqsg
neither was he a p-plater at the moment,btohqsg
and no  he is not covered by GG insurance. cos no GG acc,btohqsg
let me dig my friends review,btohqsg
Shariot (Pump petrol urself):Pros:-$0 deposit.-Wide range of models.-Cheapest van rental ($6.90/h all day excluding GST & Plat. fee)-Attractive 12h rental rate.-Active telegram group.Neutral:-Average customer service (Live Chat & Telegram).Cons:-Vehicle cleanliness and maintenance.-Ugly stickers.-No access to physical car key.,btohqsg
GetGo is most ex iirc correctly,btohqsg
yes? how else would you cover insurance in the most economical way if it wasnt by name,btohqsg
CarLite (Pump petrol urself)Pros:-Cars have no stickers.-Access to physical car key.-Newish cars.-Attractive full day rental rate.-Cheapest rental in the market (off-peak).-Excellent customer service (Call).Neutral:-Exterior condition of cars (scratches).Cons:-Limited locations.-Smallest vehicle fleet.-Higher deposit ($300) for P-Plate.GetGo (Mileage charged)Pros:-Very convenient locations.-$0 deposit.-Wide range of models.-Don‚Äôt need to worry about petrol.Neutral:-Average customer service (Live Chat).Cons:-No access to physical car key.-Ugly ‚ÄúGetGo‚Äù stickers.-Mileage charge is costly if you‚Äôre covering a long distance.,btohqsg
last i was discussing abt it w my friend,btohqsg
the providing petrol part + cleanliness doesn‚Äôt make up for the price bro,btohqsg
it costs more to use than to pump,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt make a big diff frm what i‚Äôve gathered,btohqsg
Cos u pay more than needed lor,btohqsg
peak hr - 8 hrs rental$80lets say 90km$35.1,btohqsg
CDW 5% and the rest i dont put in,btohqsg
u pay $115.10 exclusive of the rest,btohqsg
if i compare to tribe;8hrs rental is roughly $60 bucks? or less? i don‚Äôt recall$25 Petrol +20% disc depends on gas station card also,btohqsg
brother u ask for advice on which car sharing is the best,btohqsg
now is u compare apples to oranges leh bro,btohqsg
pricewise ; your carlite still win nia,btohqsg
pump $20-25 is enough for a day‚Äôs trip but depends on what car and what ur doing,btohqsg
then we talk abt vehicle condition,btohqsg
carlite straight away win getgo anyday customer service‚Ä¶problem solving‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Availability of cars & choices is the only con,btohqsg
chill leh bro dont need caps,btohqsg
GetGo in event of accident must ask staff to come down & evaluate,btohqsg
