Hi guys i would like to ask  how would you go about teaching someone who has poor English grammar,btohqsg
Because i don't think the way i learnt it works for him now,btohqsg
Teach the diff grammar rules first,btohqsg
Then give exercises by asking him what are the mistakes that are being made in the exercises,btohqsg
You mapped out a progress for me,btohqsg

Lmao this group has become more of a targetted ad group with occasional conversations,btohqsg
hellu any nus cs senior able to give advice on ATAP?,btohqsg
I didn't go thru that route tho,btohqsg
looking at the pre-reqs of my mod  i might be only going ATAP in the last sem,btohqsg
which according to the web  i‚Äôll only be attending convo. the following year,btohqsg
I hope I tag the correct guy,btohqsg
@andrewomeif you don‚Äôt mind  can i dm!,btohqsg
Long long long long long long long long time yes,btohqsg
If not u can try asking in the sg codin Grp,btohqsg
Idk if I'm still in thr,btohqsg
but for your qn... atap will eat into special term so you should actually hit up the soc office instead cause i won't know what's their stance lol,btohqsg
they can always make special arrangements?,btohqsg
cause internship results take super long to come out  like i can finish my internship in aug and the results only come out in september,btohqsg
according to the atap webpage  sem2 ATAP will span to ST1  degree conferred on 31 aug  but i join the ceremony following year,btohqsg
idk if the ceremony part is an issue (?),btohqsg
you can not appear for it,btohqsg
i think the issue now is my prereqs is messed up :'),btohqsg
i wanted swe + security but 4239 has 2107 and 3235 as pre-reqs,btohqsg
if you can prove that it will affect graduation sch may allow you to skip prereqs and do them concurrently,btohqsg
frankly 3235 isn't that much more than 2107 lol,btohqsg
unless somehow or another 3235 and 4239 can be taken concurrently,btohqsg
Time to prove to them without cs double degree i cant graduate,btohqsg
i've seen ppl doing 3235 + other mods with 3235 as prereq tgt as well,btohqsg
oh wait no‚Ä¶. i can‚Äôt do it even with concurrent2107/3235,btohqsg
since 4239 is offered in sem1,btohqsg
mayhaps time to revise your plans then... lol,btohqsg
yeah seems like sec route is no go then,btohqsg
like just don't take a graduation requirement mod until you completed enough mods for a second degree,btohqsg
it's damn stupid but is that possible lmao,btohqsg
i don't think the school would complain,btohqsg
after all you're paying the fees,btohqsg
but whether or not they will confer you the 2nd degree is the question,btohqsg
actually yea thats the thing I was wondering,btohqsg
you have to go through the application process and get it approved,btohqsg
that's the bare minimum i suppose,btohqsg
I'm gonna have to delete this first  pls go through the offical channels if you wanna post a link,btohqsg
my friend got forced to graduate or take more 4k mods,btohqsg
uni will rush you to take whatever mods you are missing,btohqsg
you don't  graduate  but at what cost,btohqsg
