Money smart and Amex state the different promoNot sure which is true,btohqsg
Both are correct. Miles are most likely to be fulfilled by moneysmart which might explain the differences. Check the tncs from moneysmart for the amex card,btohqsg
Only for insurance provider accepting Mastercard payment then:AMEX TCB topup to GPMC,btohqsg
I read somewhere in this forum or elsewhere. Payment via ApplePay  not consider online payment. Only way to find out is for me to call UOB 🤣,btohqsg

Coincidentally  I've had my transactions via liquid pay (amaze card-crmc linked) declined in hawker stalls...#justsaying,btohqsg
A tip is to try a small transaction with Amaze  and ask their customer service for the MCC of the transaction  and check with Citi TnCs.,btohqsg
Can try to use something e.g. way back machine and google search about past offers to determine… No matter what after 1 year of cancelling all your cc with the bank you are new to bank again… so just apply if you think the offer is good enough haha,btohqsg
First time user here.. how frequent does the promo come?,btohqsg
Does this also apply to HSBC and Diners Club?,btohqsg
Usually one year I think. But you can check their TnCs to confirm.,btohqsg
