Can just afraid remaining balance will wasted,btohqsg
Better than charge more than 2k and get 0.4mpd for that no?,btohqsg
Yes same username. Can tell by the comment style haha üòÜ. Have unique characteristics.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  is there any way we can convert UOB Uni $ to krisflyer for free?,btohqsg
Unless you are uob privilege customer with the uob privilege card,btohqsg
Your uob card will have a special carving that stated privilege banking. At least 350k with uob i think,btohqsg
And when that is the case the online transaction will automatically have 0 fees is it? Or would I need to go to the bank branch?,btohqsg
There is some mention need to go branch or something or if u have uob vi card u need to convert the miles thru the vi card,btohqsg
Seems worse than normal banking üòÜ,btohqsg
I think more of like need to link one card for the free conversion for privilege banking when doing the krisflyer setup. But incase make mistake go branch let staff guide u loh,btohqsg
for chocolate finance   if i put in money on the weekend will it get the daily returns ?,btohqsg
Yes daily $2.30 if put 20K,btohqsg
"Daily ""interests"" depending on market performance",btohqsg
No point putting more than 20k,btohqsg
As others said  no point out over $20k as your daily returns may go up and down in short term. What I do is put $20k and withdraw daily. Or you can put $19.9k and withdraw after some time :),btohqsg
Hi guys  has anyone get their cash back rewards clawed back by money smart due to canceling the card before 12 mths?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know what would be the MCC if I use my card on shopback pay? Is it based on the shopback MCC or based on the MCC of each merchant? I check heymax  shopback is under 5712.,btohqsg
Shopback vouchers‚Äô mcc codes are entire beasts themselves,btohqsg
Does anyone encounter being charged overseas transaction fee using DBS card on merchants like Agoda or other travel agents despite choosing SGD as the currency when making payment?,btohqsg
You meant the 1% dynamic currency conversion fee?,btohqsg
Yeah. DBS says all banks have but it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôm encountering it. Never had issues with other cards/banks when I booked on platforms like Agoda and other travel agents - what I‚Äôm being charged is the same as the invoice,btohqsg
not say no point ba   cause i just have a bit of cash lying around and i know that the choco finance is like moomoo's MMF or similar.,btohqsg
Extra cash .. I suggest you can put in esaver or bonus saver,btohqsg
Not sure if anybody else experienced the same and have any tips to avoid this if I want to continue to use dbs card?,btohqsg
This is example from uob. Agoda is known for having mixed payment gateways in Singapore and overseas. No way you can avoid this using dbs card and agoda. At least uob lady can use with amaze to avoid this.,btohqsg
Thanks bro.. I likely use your suggestion to book my next trip. Combination of Agoda and marriot bonvy hotel,btohqsg
Erm. Marriot wont give member pts if you book through agoda.,btohqsg
And amex plat charge cant be used with amaze sir,btohqsg
My hotel strategy is book 3 days for a 3.5 to 3.7** hotel through agoda. The rest book through marriot bonvy website,btohqsg
In that way save $$ also,btohqsg
Im not marriot expert. I thought need to keep staying in marriot chain to maintain status/advance to the next one?,btohqsg
Can stay more night... but you got to spend more...,btohqsg
How sneaky of Agoda. You are right - my past transactions on other cards shows Agoda sg. Maybe that‚Äôs why don‚Äôt have the conversion fee.Do you know if I use amaze with uob lady‚Äôs  can I still use the bank promo codes on these websites? Or they won‚Äôt be able to read that I‚Äôm paying with uob card?Does amaze with other cards work or only with uob lady‚Äôs?,btohqsg
u got plat charge.. for elites  few more nights no prob for you,btohqsg
How... they charge you less $$ for hotel stay ?,btohqsg
So far I know is if you book 5th night . The 5th one is free.,btohqsg
Amaze works with any master cards. Dbs excludes amaze so cant use. Most common pairing are crmc  uob lady and uob kf. Once u use amaze  cant use bank promo. However  you can use agoda + master card promo which i find sometimes cheaper.,btohqsg
u got plat charge few nights you can afford easily,btohqsg
No la ... rich won't want to siam the welcome bonus of 8k already,btohqsg
Btw  dont use amaze with crmc or uob kf with agoda. Recommend to use uob lady only if you go down this path.,btohqsg
May go negative leh you want ? lol. Excess can put in Mari invest or CIMB Fast-saver or SCB eSaver,btohqsg
Have you maxed out all the HYSA?,btohqsg
I'll take whatever this man said with a huge chunk of salt,btohqsg
Where is the wall that he wanted to build?,btohqsg
Will Mari Invest end up with less than the deposited money? I am with Maribank and thought of trying Mari Invest,btohqsg
Anything ‚Äúinvest‚Äù can go negative.Unless u see ‚Äúcapital guanrantee‚Äù in tnc,btohqsg
Does topping up cash card using nets app qualify for the $800 min spend for ocbc 365 card?,btohqsg
Not saying 0% but if you look at the fund compositions is mostly corp bond and some govt bond mostly quite big name ~,btohqsg
Is using Ezlink to pay for SGQR a way to earn some miles? Like would citi rewards or HSBC travelone give some miles?,btohqsg
Nope  u earn ezlink link app point,btohqsg
