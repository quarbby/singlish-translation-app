Hi all  just curious to ask what sort of USD or EUR shares or funds from Robo advisors you are investing into? Not asking for financial advise  looking for opinions and reference point only. Thanks üôè,btohqsg
Have you explored the Robo's websites yet? Some dont require you to choose the funds. You can just hope on their core portfolios. See if they suit you.There are quite a number of robos to choose from.EndowusSyfeMoneyOwlStashaway (don't go with themüòÇ).There are also robos from banks if you are more comfortable with that.,btohqsg
For me submitted at the end of Dec and processed only in the middle of Feb.,btohqsg
can u pls tell us why u dont like stashwaay?,btohqsg
not just me. Its a general consensus.,btohqsg
i dun like them also  but i'm invested with them and been losing,btohqsg
Some Reasons- Higher fees as compared to other robos.- They have been making bad decisions which has led to lower or negative returns.- They sold kept adding on china stocks when it was dropping and sold it at the lowest point and moving the funds to other allocations (Tell me this is not active trading lol),btohqsg
I have tried playing around with Moomoo for the free kopi 60 dollars signup bonus and hold on to Fullerton cash fund.Have a friend working with Philips  so going to sign up with Poems and check them on. More on learning mentality. Find ways to earn passive income in USD/ EUR  that‚Äôs my core idea ü§£,btohqsg
Are you signing up with Philips just because if your friend?If income there are robos to serve you as well. There is syfe reits if not you can go to endowus using their income portfolioI think@ChrisHMSGshould have some referral codes for the robos you can use them for extra rewards,btohqsg
I‚Äôve actually lost more with Syfe than StashAway surprisingly,btohqsg
DBS DIGIPOTFOLIO is interesting   because the Digi DBS Portfolio only calculates management fees (daily balance)  and not transactional fees. But question is do we DCA on our own or do we do lump sum?,btohqsg
i think its at pegged @0.75% of total  $value of portfolio,btohqsg
Kevin did a review over 6 months  the performance was +11%.. something to consider üòÇ,btohqsg
Please dont just look at returns.... also look at the funds they invest in. if different funds not apples to apples lehTime also plays a part,btohqsg
Abit  thanks for the info. It‚Äôs good  will absorb and try to come out with a practical step by step execution plan for myself üôè,btohqsg
yeap  historical data don't guarantee future gains.. only invest what you can lose! Even bank bonds are not entirely safe like Credit Suisse  but then again AT-1 class bond is slightly different hahaha,btohqsg
Most likely next t bills will be lower ?,btohqsg
Yeap. But the syfe one is the pur equities one not their core. So expected? I haven't checked in months cause I stopped all investment completely till I see some signs like the feds reversing their rates,btohqsg
I would agree to disagree here. That's not the point of robo. If you have the time to go look and find out about the underlying funds you should really be considering to do it yourself you already did like minimally  75% of the work liao.,btohqsg
what work? Am I suppose to invest into a robo without knowing the underlying funds?,btohqsg
His point is since you already went thru the trouble of finding out about the funds  might as well just diy into ETFs for much less fees,btohqsg
Sorry I thought you meant doing even more due diligence than a somewhat surface level knowledge of the funds.,btohqsg
Yeap. ESP if it‚Äôs anything more than really surface level stuff. That‚Äôs what the management  fee is for (at least that‚Äôs how I justified it to myself lah),btohqsg
I am refer to just the funds in the portfolio for comparison. If the other robo uses a totally different fund in the portfolio  it is not a apples to apples comparison for returns,btohqsg
Its a less then 5 mins job ü•≤,btohqsg
While yes‚Ä¶ the funds they invest in is their ‚Äúalgo‚Äù no‚Ä¶ so‚Ä¶ technically‚Ä¶..I would still say the comparison is valid in a way,btohqsg
But regardless I do feel most robo advisors are really samaSama,btohqsg
And it‚Äôs sure as hell better than Ilp or worse doing nothing,btohqsg
it is really sama sama. all their core portfolios are the same,btohqsg
only the satellite or rather themes portfolios are diff,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  anyone have been using the HSBC EGA for some time already? can i check is it must deposit at least $2k into the account each month + have 5 eligible transaction via giro/credit card then can get the 1% cashback?,btohqsg
