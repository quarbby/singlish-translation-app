They say he was test driving,btohqsg
If is test drive  is claim dealer insurance? or he ownself pay,btohqsg
So from the testing  looks like the car not good,btohqsg
Maybe dealer civil suit and claim back from tester,btohqsg
Wah then the dealer premiums up,btohqsg
Waiver means? All responsibility on driver?,btohqsg
but if you test driver you no insurance,btohqsg
oh yeah.. last time i buy from direct owner,btohqsg
if dealer skip this step.. gg lo,btohqsg

most of the time dealer will skip,btohqsg
but most of the time that fella wont expect you to just step also,btohqsg
haha step also not indoors la..,btohqsg
i got ask MG dealer permission before step,btohqsg
carros outside so many empty roads,btohqsg
you drive further you reach 40T,btohqsg
most likely is dealer have to claim insurance first,btohqsg
the car belongs to who  that entity have the responsibility,btohqsg
after that  the dealer wanna fight and claim the driver or what  is another thing. Most likely,btohqsg
but also have to see the insurance. Sometimes the insurance nv cover unauthorised drivers. Then die.,btohqsg

He was going too fast into the corner,btohqsg
i think the fact that he thinks inside buildings good place to play,btohqsg
He thought his missufiring system will work on the corners üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
He thought got gutter can put his tyres inside,btohqsg
