How do i redeem my points to miles for HSBC Revolution?Realise its not as straightforward as HSBC TravelOne,btohqsg
Enrol in the mileage program and go to web banking to convert.https://www.hsbc.com.sg/forms/mileage-programme-registration/,btohqsg
Oh thanks alot for the info,btohqsg
Hallo guys   anyone know what is the ratio to topup cpf for taxes relief?? Any place I can check or calculate??,btohqsg
It must be in blocks of $100 to redeem the rebate? Cos i read the T&C  it states $10 for UNI$1136. So its UNI$800 isnit?,btohqsg
I believe the rate gets better as you redeem more. I see the 8700 = $100 and 2000 = $20 available in my app to redeem  and at 1136 = $10 (I havent seen this one yet) if its true  thatâ€™s the worst rate of all,btohqsg
VCMA/RSTU will be dollar for dollar  top-up to tax relief. Max 8k to self and another 8k to loved ones,btohqsg
Anyway 1136 = $10 is about 1.7% cashback from a 4mpd card  at that point you might as well just switch to a real general spend cashback card youâ€™re wasting the 4mpd.,btohqsg
Ppv has no exclusions right? Just need to be mobile contactless?,btohqsg
"For ocbc 360 salary crediting  my salary is in already but the ""salary credited"" isn't updated... can I still make withdrawal or have to wait for it to updated?",btohqsg
Hi all  if I use Citi rewards card and do a recurring on giga   my republic isit consider a online transaction?,btohqsg
Have. Go read the tnc. All cards have exclusions,btohqsg
There are exclusions  and thereâ€™s also the monthly cap.https://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/cards/credit-cards/rewards-cards/uob-preferred-platinum-visa-card/terms-and-conditions-for-preferred-plat-visa.pdfAnd of course thereâ€™s the larger question of why youâ€™re using a miles card when what you actually want is cashback ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
You sure the salary is eligible for ocbc ? Giro salary,btohqsg
Real salary ? Must be from corporate account Giro salary,btohqsg
Had the transaction emailshowing its giro,btohqsg
Yeap.. corporate salary payment via giro,btohqsg
Can withdraw if not it'll affect your average balance,btohqsg
Sorry  how come via kris+ can'tFor uob woman's card?,btohqsg
Anybody do webull share transfer in from Poems? How many days it took to transfer?,btohqsg
Kris+ mcc for EU is 7991.,btohqsg
Whoa.. I used kris+ with uob ladies via Google pay on EU travel as well. Thinking will get 6mpd plus extra 1mpd from krisðŸ˜­,btohqsg
When? Did check your bonus UNI$?,btohqsg
Few days ago  I went to make payment for package tour in EU travel suntec. Used kris + with uob,btohqsg
The bonus will only come in early Feb to check ya,btohqsg
It is discuss before that datapoint from past user eu on kris+ mcc 7991 is not within the bonus mcc,btohqsg
So to get that 1 extra kris+ miles lose the extra 5.4 bonus miles when u swipe directly with card loh,btohqsg
Update us on first week of Feb did u get bonus UNI$.,btohqsg
How do I check if shops like MC2 Pte Ltd that do curtains and blinds are eligible for HSBC revolution bonus miles? Thanks,btohqsg
Can always try to appeal to uob if u din get the bonus point since eu is obviously a travel agency,btohqsg
You need to check what is the mcc code of the merchants. You can search using either merchant name or mcc code at:https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Hey thanks. Usually I just pay and forget  didn't check the pts given. Will be more diligent to check now!,btohqsg
Heymax is based on visa data point  and kris + is a payment gateway which might explain why it cause eu to become 7991.Unionpay  diner  amex  mastercard  visa jcb might give different mcc depending on the merchant  just because u get 1 mcc for the merchant does not mean it will be the same for different payment processor,btohqsg
The company name doesnâ€™t appear in heymax,btohqsg
Thanks! I will call up uob to check as well,btohqsg
Eu is specifically mention on uob page so can try appeal if dont get,btohqsg
Anyone know the MCC for Fiverr?,btohqsg
You can search using either merchant name or mcc code at:https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Ok lesson learnt.Kris+ changed the Mcc code of EU holiday. So I don't get the bonus pts. Cso said can't appeal cos they go with Mcc code only.,btohqsg
Kris+ with dbs woman's world will get 4mpd right? For EU holiday payment.Scared of kris liao ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Miles earned can only survive one year in DBS WWMC account.,btohqsg
