Wow then I think I'll ask my dad sell his suv away get a golf !!!,btohqsg
what suv ur dad have ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
I think ur dad will still prefer a Suv more.. Lol..,btohqsg
X6m.... can't even fit much in the boot,btohqsg
but can easily go thailand frm doorstep in 7 hours,btohqsg
wow... finally somebody that actually drives an X6m,btohqsg
liftbacks are useful when they on sedans though,btohqsg
When u getting ur A5 ?,btohqsg
i jio u buy ur dream car,btohqsg
Then you help me dp my house,btohqsg
I let you use the car first,btohqsg
Ya the bmw legendary 6 cyl,btohqsg
So where the q5 and x5?,btohqsg
Very usable despite the sloping roof line,btohqsg
I'd steal a x5m over x6m anyday,btohqsg
If i were you i take both,btohqsg
I dont want to be associated,btohqsg
U go buy  i print the money for u,btohqsg
I borrow a 3d printer and print for you,btohqsg
I agree  X5 looks super nice,btohqsg
The x5 used to dominate the 7 seater suv segment,btohqsg
But the current gle i think looks damn good,btohqsg
Until they didn't update it for a while ant the Q7 became the modern one,btohqsg
I believe the GLE has the least room in the 3rd row,btohqsg
Too bad merc only had the r,btohqsg
Audis never really progress much between models. Other than the tech and the lights,btohqsg
And the GLE was the ML,btohqsg
Shape and looks wise still visually the same  can see the old model in it,btohqsg
Well whatever works for each brand,btohqsg
All cars maintain the same essential DNA nowadays,btohqsg
Too bad the ML wasnt a people carrier,btohqsg
Porsche should come up with one,btohqsg
Look how much hate the g80 got when it first came out,btohqsg
The Cayenne facelift is coming  they might add in a 7 seat option for it,btohqsg
But Porsche has always maintained that they wouldn't do a huge people carrier,btohqsg
Timeless design is a nice way to say it,btohqsg
It's actually the same platform as the q8  bentayga  urus  etc.,btohqsg
There is room for a third row if they push the rear seats slightly forward and use up the donut wheel space,btohqsg
Sir it's not something to debate on  it is literally a fact,btohqsg
Actually platform wise. It can always be modified,btohqsg
Just like how the glb was based on the a class,btohqsg
That the Cayenne platform is the same as the bentayga  urus  q8,btohqsg
Not the best in terms of dynamics  but it sells,btohqsg
Yuppp but I doubt Porsche would do that and sacrifice the dynamics,btohqsg
Sir it literally isn't up for debate,btohqsg
It's a fact from VAG group,btohqsg
That it is the same platform,btohqsg
Hahaha dont need to get worked up. People believe what they want to believe,btohqsg
We all know this chat is full of them,btohqsg
Which gen? Which chassis? Which variant?,btohqsg
