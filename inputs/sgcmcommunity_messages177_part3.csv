Would you guys report a cyclist to TP who swore at you and banged his fist on the car? Cam footage indicates he's in the wrong. But not sure if any law broken,btohqsg
Get that pest off the road,btohqsg
Yeah  thought of doing a public service but waste of time if no law broken. No damage except high blood pressure,btohqsg

New injection of additional COE quota announced for NovemberThe LTA has announced yet another new injection of available COEs - across Categories A  B and C - for the period from November 2023 to January 2024.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 React with 🙏 for COE to go down this round!,btohqsg
As long as the rental and car sharing companies have free reign to manipulate COE prices it'll never go down,btohqsg
ADs and PIs also earn more from loan commissions  so they wouldn't mind high prices also,btohqsg
Yah  these group wouldn't want coe to drop,btohqsg
Any extra supply would just be absorbed by more demand cos buyers fear no more chance,btohqsg
So coe as a tool to control car population is crap,btohqsg
Gahmen get more money to give us GST vouchers lol,btohqsg
Take from me chicken farm and give me a chicken wing,btohqsg
I also dun want the coe to drop . I want it to continue to raise .,btohqsg
Because I bought at high coe mah,btohqsg
If coe drop   means I will lose more $$$ when selling,btohqsg
I also buy at high coe,btohqsg
But cant wait for it to drop,btohqsg
But election should come before 2025,btohqsg
I hope when coe drop  all the used car dealers hg  need scrap or sell at lower price,btohqsg
Before the implementation of the erp 2.0,btohqsg
By right w ERP 2.0 COE should be scrapped,btohqsg
But they never mention anything about it,btohqsg
My friend told me coe will remain,btohqsg
So charge me COE + Car usage,btohqsg
This govt is getting too greedy,btohqsg
They want people to use the transportation system they build,btohqsg
If not why they dig and dig,btohqsg
Tats why forcing ppl go back office,btohqsg
But you get back balance coe when you sell ma,btohqsg
He buy at high coe + PARF / OMV,btohqsg
Then when he sell when coe low  his coe amt is reduced alr,btohqsg
i believe coe is high is 5G agenda,btohqsg
they slap u give u $1 its for your own good. then they take $2 from u. history repeat itself  pap always like that,btohqsg
LW cannot be PM nor are the current batch. that is IMHO i will never give them my vote,btohqsg
Thank goodness you're not running our country then.,btohqsg
haha bro y u always a pro,btohqsg
i respect your opinion but will not give them my vote,btohqsg
He not running ? He just saying they CMI. 🫨 subjective. I think LW can  but some of the appt holders cmi.. esp small space,btohqsg
I'm not pro PAP  but not anti PAP either. Just LW is capable enough  but he needs to choose the right people for the cabinet,btohqsg
Coe is a necessary evil i feel,btohqsg
If nt whole street flooded w cars,btohqsg
But exploited by some commercial entities for profit,btohqsg
That one needs to be stopped,btohqsg
