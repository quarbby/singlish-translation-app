This 1 need ask our expert liao there a 2nd hand car experrt here that time tell me carchoice listing are fake,btohqsg
rich ppl buy car to test ... they dun test n buy. a very rich man once told me,btohqsg
meaning: for the employees to drive/ test drive cartoo many miles on it to be sold as new hence sold as used  otherwise fully maintained by company as well,btohqsg
rich people pay $500 for mini s oil change!,btohqsg
I concur. They said what for waste time testing car if the car that you bought is not the same.,btohqsg
Management car..... Used by employees sir or as a demo car. Usually sold between 3k to 10k km of miles before too old,btohqsg
If someone is really rich  they won't buy a car use for a few months and sell  probably understand the concept of depreciation and know how much they will lose on it. This is more of a thing that a pseudo rich person or one who has suddenly come into money will do,btohqsg
Can consider watching this guy to understand if you don't find a real rich person in life,btohqsg
if someone is rich  he doesnt even need to sell the car... just buy another one😂😂,btohqsg
That too  and they tend to take better financial decisions than others anyway,btohqsg

watch this... very close to our hearts. cars that resemble ours,btohqsg
after flooring daily for one year  the motor beaks down and he will change to a new car.,btohqsg
and then floor the pedal he does again. rinse and repeat,btohqsg
it is not just toyota. mazda is incredibly reliable. that is why i drive mazda more than germans,btohqsg
that's y if buy used better buy from elderly...,btohqsg
