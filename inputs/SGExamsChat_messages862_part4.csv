Anybody here waiting or already attended the interview for PGDE?,btohqsg
Does this look like a reasonable choice of programmes? My grades are roughly equivalent to 3.2 Poly GPA,btohqsg
Probably explain why you chose the order of the programs,btohqsg
Then I can advise you ba,btohqsg
Fyi  computing science you need spend 2-3 weeks in Glasgow. Need pay for your own flight tickets.,btohqsg
so they're all computing/IT-related degrees. the ordering is based on how hard these programs are to get into,btohqsg
(CDM is the exception as the last choice),btohqsg
That shouldn't be how you're ordering your programs. You should find out what area you're more interested in. Don't make a decision you'll regret,btohqsg
Computing Science itself will be quite rushed  because you are taking all your modules within 2 years. Your 3rd year is 1 year internship.,btohqsg
I'm in IS and it's something I enjoy doing  since I also studied it in poly and I enjoyed it. There's also quite a lot of my coursemates that dived into IS just because it sounds cool  but they dont know what they signed themselves up to.,btohqsg
3.2 GPA can enter quite easily into SIT  but you should relook at the order of your programmes chosen. Make sure that those are careers you really have a passion for and want to pursue,btohqsg
I'm more worried about how hard it is to get in  because I graduated from NUS High (the GPA is a converted GPA from our CAP system),btohqsg
You can look at the indicative grade profile available on SIT website,btohqsg
they don't have one for the NUS High CAP system,btohqsg
Do note that dependent on your previous academic background  you may also need to attend a physical interview to show the school that yes  this is a course you want to enter,btohqsg
It's fine. Cause SIT is probably one of the only universities where your gpa doesn't matter too much. It's more of your skills and passion,btohqsg
Since NUS High is STEM related  so long as you show that you have passion for IT and you know what you are signing yourself up for  should be quite a high chance you pass the interview,btohqsg
i heard sit focuses much on portfolio than grades. 3.2 is more than enough to enter sit,btohqsg
honestly  what is SUSS looking for in the personal essays of the applicants?,btohqsg
Why not try NTU or NUS or SmU,btohqsg
I want to ask jc h2 math student   apart from being able to use binomialpdf  binomialcdf and generating list of probabilities to find mode  what other functionality do I not know apart from what I listed?,btohqsg
Like am I missing out more things I should know?,btohqsg
if your Current Exchange allows can apply to Monash University.,btohqsg
SGD and AUD almost 1:1 exchange rate.,btohqsg
"instead of going to SIT.Can go to some ""Overseas"" University to make your Resume abit slightly more interesting.",btohqsg
my mother isn't fully convinced in that,btohqsg
Take ielts or toefl to show her u can do and qualify?,btohqsg

oh  just providing alternative pathways to go overseas studies if Singapore Unis doesn't enrolls Poly Diploma Results,btohqsg
If Rankings and Pricing in your most concern.Malaysia's UM's CS Degree costs RM 80k?https://study.um.edu.my/programmes.php?act=3#senarai,btohqsg
SUSS seniors: can someone please share what you wrote for your personal statement?,btohqsg
Suss is meant for working adults working and studying at the same time..it's more relatable to working indusr,btohqsg
this good enough as a personal statement structure?- I am an adaptive learner able to acquire knowledge in a fast-changing environment.- I am happiest when I can dive deep into a subject and understand it thoroughly. I read widely on topics as varied as (insert examples).- A logical practitioner apt to apply computational thinking- A passionate problem solver keen to engage real world issues with novel solutions- However  (honest analysis of the barriers? Feels dangerously self-deprecative)- Because of this  the SUSS ethos of inclusive university education has been a big draw  and I particularly like the options for second majors  which allows students to also stretch themselves and get an education in diverse fields  which is perfect for someone like me with varied intellectual interests ranging from information technology to Chinese language  literature  society and culture.- I also like the work attachment  as it allows students to gain experience in the working world.,btohqsg
my mom won't let me go overseas for uni,btohqsg
But can your family afford it ? Just curious,btohqsg
Lmao.. you all don't size him up..his family problems we won't know. Work with what you have.. because uni is something you feel you ought to have after working in the industry but obviously it's not necessarily. A skill set to earn higher salary with advancement tagging to the industry. Not all industry requires a degree..don't add more financial burden unnecessarily.,btohqsg
Because it's an additional 3-4yrs more. If doesn't pay you extra 2k+..I don't see why you want to pay so much for it..,btohqsg
ahhh actually  if don't want go Uni.Actually have 42SGhttps://www.instagram.com/42singapore/free initiative coding school.Later have jobs opportunities I feel should pay well la.,btohqsg
https://www.instagram.com/p/DG5BZKjpS9p/I like this SG MP's style lol,btohqsg
Personal opinion here   other than a few occupations   a degree is a must.  Also  unless you have a opportunity right in front of you  its best if you take a degree instead of gambling your luck with the job market or boot camps etc. 42 Point is one option but tbh not the best considering CS is very saturated and not having a degree is just killing your chances.,btohqsg
I might have been too personal with the last question my bad.,btohqsg
This is my personal take   if you can go local uni   great! However  if your family can afford to send you to a decent overseas uni in Aus or UK ( like UNSW and Uni of Mel) then if I'm in your shoes   I will fight for that opportunity. However  the cavet is that I must know that no matter what happens  I'll need to find a job in that country after graduation which can be a tough thing (but it's not exclusive to just a specific country),btohqsg
Especially since working in SG is imo   not ideal.,btohqsg
For a wide variety of factors .,btohqsg
But that's just me of course many others have diff opinions .,btohqsg
I rather work in AU with a slightly lower pay than in SG .,btohqsg
Yea  ..that's a more nicer way of answering. üòÅ Make more friends here ok ‚ù§Ô∏è.. don't crush the little kid's feeling ok..,btohqsg
At least read up on the course you want to pursue. So long as you are able to convince the interviewer you should be fine,btohqsg
Finance assistance wise in SIT  dont really have to worry so much la,btohqsg
Tuition Grant in SIT  along with community bursary and private bursary  would pretty much settle your school fees for ya,btohqsg
