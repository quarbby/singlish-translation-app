tech-based lessons should bank on new tech instead of old,btohqsg
i dont think they are over-valued or have a bad model,btohqsg
so u're suggesting that a similar thing to geniebook is a bad business idea but shd innovate more? o.o,btohqsg
i just think the tech can be replicated,btohqsg
they use ‚ÄúAI‚Äù and ‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù for their tech,btohqsg
admittedly i dont know much abt their algorithms but so far they haven‚Äôt expanded much,btohqsg
they are quite old for a start up,btohqsg
if its truly revolutionary i think the startup wouldve gotten a lot of traction and grew,btohqsg
but its been awhile and they are still mainly used in the founder‚Äôs own tuition centres,btohqsg
maybe its their business model  maybe its their tech  who knows. i havent done sufficient research on it but my sentiment is more can be done,btohqsg
esp since they got millions of VC money  which is not easy,btohqsg
that means analysts at the VC saw industry-disrupting potential in the product,btohqsg
what u think about investing into GB?,btohqsg
actually if they had wanted to make GB a big thing  they could have. maybe the market was not ready pre-COVID since everyone was used to face-to-face?,btohqsg
those have quite high hurdles to jump through,btohqsg
VC dont anyhow take 100k de lol?,btohqsg
buyside firms take 1mm minimum with 10mm of wealth.,btohqsg
and nobody ever invests 1mm- -,btohqsg
thats small money with high transaction fees,btohqsg
they rather take 1 10mm than 10 1mm,btohqsg
and honestly u asking for investment advise here u prob dunno shit about investing- -,btohqsg
Damn thats one fked up pair of ankles,btohqsg
True.It is still better than being too stressed though.,btohqsg
Ah yeah  too stressed leads to burn out  too lax leads to not revising.,btohqsg
You too zai  don't need to study for Chinese üòÇ,btohqsg
Yeah  I'll try to manage my workload,btohqsg
Not going to happen. Nopey nope!,btohqsg
Anyone know where i can find A3 paper,btohqsg
Other than e commerce website  I'm not too sure.,btohqsg
Thanks. Cos i just need 10,btohqsg
I was lucky enough to score a 4 for n level chinese. With that  I don't think it is possible to score a distinction,btohqsg
Back when I was doing Chinese  you were considered legendary if you could consistently score above B3 for Chinese,btohqsg
It is not easy to score for language in sch exam,btohqsg
Sch teachers are v stingy for languages,btohqsg
I pray that I'll pass my Chinese,btohqsg
With oral and lc pass is easy,btohqsg
Why is chinese so difficult üò≠,btohqsg
Guys if i apply for this course via jae,btohqsg
Will they take both my a math and emath,btohqsg
For example i take english combined science math a math and chinese,btohqsg
they will take whichever is better,btohqsg
It is more of either math or a math,btohqsg
Was wanting to change humanities to A math,btohqsg
Cause humanities need study so much,btohqsg
Advise? Your grammar is bad lol wtf,btohqsg
Stop talking down at people if you cant even reason properly or hold a convo üòÇ,btohqsg
Not investment advice but knowing more. Am all ears.,btohqsg
Probably should go do your O levels first before being condescending,btohqsg
Whatever you say man whatever you say. Talk about grammar all you want not gonna change how I write in telegram chats. You are not my LP nor my GP why should I even care,btohqsg
Alright  you wanna talk about other topics  fine. Don't have disputes here,btohqsg
