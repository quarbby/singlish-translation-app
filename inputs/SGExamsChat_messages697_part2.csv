but in the comments i saw that the OP thought that elite schools have stricter rules,btohqsg
lol this topic reminds me of my brother‚Äôs GP essay,btohqsg
Finally and most compelling would be how technology entrenches systemic discrimination against the poor  such that is even goes unnoticed. This is due to the fact that technology is increasingly being used to replace subjective human judgements and evaluations with more ‚Äúobjective ones‚Äù  such as the use of algorithms in all areas of society. An interesting case study would be of the ‚ÄúStreet Bump‚Äù mobile application developed by Boston‚Äôs government. The application would send data to the government about potholes in roads by using phones‚Äô accelerometer to detect worn-down roads. While good intentioned  the poorer regions of Boston were eventually totally excluded from essential road repairs  simply because the people living there did not have phones needed to send data to the government‚Äîas a result  poorer neighbourhoods were completely overlooked because of technology. Another example would be of the algorithmic sentencing tools now employed in the legal systems of countries. These tools determine whether the accused in court should be granted bail or go to prison  supposedly absolving judges from making this difficult decision. However  since these tools often operate on past databases rife with historical precedents for discrimination against the poor  they often suggest that the poor have to pay higher bails if they want to avoid internment  or worse still  that they do not even get the chance to pay bail. Consequently  criminal offenders from society‚Äôs less-privileged demographics are often denied the chance to pay bail  resulting in the crippling state of being in jail where they cannot even earn an income for their families and where they are forever stigmatised with the condition of ‚Äúbeing a prisoner‚Äù. Due to the way technology has the immense power to make devastating life changing decision for the poor due to past historical prejudice against them  the poor evidently suffer from the imposition of technology over their lives.,btohqsg
