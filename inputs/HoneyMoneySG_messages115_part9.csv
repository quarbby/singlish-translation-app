Some cards block ipaymy instead of cardup. Remember that ipaymy charge flat fee as well. Calculate with excel to be sure.,btohqsg
Sry  forgot to ask but most sources on the Internet say that only MasterCard ATMs do not charge a usage fee but VISA ones charge about 100-200 yen. Is this not true?,btohqsg
Does theDBS Woman's World Cardhave a minimum spend to unlock 4mpd?,btohqsg
Means as long as you spend <=1500 u are entitled for the 4mpd,btohqsg
But keep in mind about roundings,btohqsg
Just curious for the UOB ONE $1600 salary  can I just Paynow my salary from my DBS ? Or must inform HR one,btohqsg
7-bank ATMs do not have withdrawal fees for mastercard. I don't believe there are any atms with fee-free withdrawal for visa,btohqsg
Ah  I guess that checks out. If only there was a MC version of Trust😂,btohqsg
correction: apparently there's some DP that AEON atms have fee free withdrawal for visa. worth a try,btohqsg
As in the unlimited atm withdrawal aspect of Trust,btohqsg
regardless still good to bring trust card since youtrip has only $400 limit (unless you multiplayer and have a few cards) and if you withdraw a big amount it's only 220yen fees max at 7-bank atms,btohqsg
What  how did you find that. Couldn't find that in google. But I'll take a look thanks man,btohqsg
You not planning to bring any cards or change money beforehand in sg before travelling?,btohqsg
Make sure is mobile contact less  apple pay/samsung pay/ google pay those,btohqsg
When u say visa widely not accept there was no mention of fee in the first place. The acceptance have nothing to do with fee from your comment isnt it,btohqsg
I'm bringing rev  youtrip  trust etc.,btohqsg
Yea  that's my bad then. Do you withdraw any cash in Japan?,btohqsg
you probably won't be using revolut much unless you need more cash than the youtrip limit since youtrip's JPY rates are hard to beat.consider bringing amaze too. you don't plan to use any credit cards?,btohqsg
So your main point is just for cash withdrawal and 0 fx fee? And not any credit card rewards?,btohqsg
I alr have plans for credit card payments. My only concern now is withdrawing cash since apparently you can only top up SUICA using cash?,btohqsg
physical suica  yep. if you have apple pay suica then you can top it up using apple pay,btohqsg
You guys don't withdraw cash in Japan?,btohqsg
They gonna introduce the SUICA on android in 2025 if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
keep waiting 😁 the tech is there but only activated on japanese androids,btohqsg
doubt it's a priority for google at this point,btohqsg
I think the app is a separate thing tho,btohqsg
It's meant to alleviate the microchip shortage I think,btohqsg
IsUOB Preferred Platinum Visa or DBS Woman's World Card better for classpass top up credits via the ClassPass app? Thank you.,btohqsg
I am not able to add my amaze card to my apple wallet anyone else face same issue,btohqsg
don't think i've seen any upcoming news of suica global release for androids? but regardless i dual wield both platforms so doesn't really affect me 😁,btohqsg
it's not available for apple pay yet,btohqsg
So do I pay the cardup fee of 1.79% for 800 bucks  or just pay for 400 bucks?,btohqsg
"""JR East is releasing a mobile Suica for tourists in Spring 2025"" - Time OutThis is the article I saw.",btohqsg
> for Apple Paybut as long as apple pay's own suica exists  there's like 0 reason to use this,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc will be safer but mcc must not be excluded mcc,btohqsg
