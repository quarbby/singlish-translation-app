For SP  I see that UOB one has bonus Cashback  UOB one most advantageous if you can hit 2k per month spendingOtherwise to bao with other electricity providers and telcos can also consider Maybank family and friends + OCBC 365 which are 800 monthly spend.I use OCBC becos I pair w my bank account to get more interest on spend. UOB has the same idea but had terrible experiences with their customer service and rather not have anything to deal w them,btohqsg

My current plan for msia is to use amaze + CRMC as my primary card  then convert SGD to RM using wise as backup. I converted quite a bit when it was 3.3+But mistake on my side  I forget to activate the wise card before going to msia. Wise you need to physically insert the card into any terminal and key in your PIN number to activate the card.,btohqsg
if I remember correctly last time I activated in Malaysia at one of the cashier. yes need to key in pin at terminal.,btohqsg
