Hi a quick question regarding uob rising dragonDoes incremental fresh fund mean 20k or 50k in a single transferOr can I transfer 20k then followed by 30k and another 20k later on in the month?,btohqsg
Thank you Queenie for sharing it with me,btohqsg
It's literally in the name. Incremental of fresh funds.1. Register the incremental funds amount you want to earmark in an eligible account during the qualifying period.2. Deposit the incremental funds (amounts that are above the reference point will be eligible) by the end of the qualifying period.3. Wait for the funds to get earmarked on the date stated in the table  based on your registered qualifying period.4. Cash credit will be deposited into the account on the earmarking day.5. Earmarked amount will be unusable but will still be kept in your account earning interests until end of earmarking period.For UOB Rising Promo  the reference point is the total balance in all your UOB accounts on 30 Dec  10:30pm.E.g. if you only have UOB One account and registered it for 50k earmark  you need to have 50k + reference point in the account there by earmarking date. To answer your question:yes  you can even deposit $1 50k times if you want.Promo table for reference:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163442,btohqsg

hi  would SC smart credit card good as a miles card? it seems to be having 5.56mpd. pls correct me if my calculation is wrong üòÖ,btohqsg
there is nothing so easy in life when it comes to earning money,btohqsg
Correct. But it‚Äôs only good if you spend a substantial amount on the merchants that get the bonus  otherwise you might take a long time to accumulate enough to convert to miles.I found the card useful as I can combine the points with my journey card and transfer to non-KF ffp.,btohqsg
oh... thanks for the info. I thought I read somewhere saying 360 rewards can't pool for certain SC cards,btohqsg
Points pool for transfer to non-Krisflyer partners  and at a rate of 7.6mpd,btohqsg

SA has a cap of current FRS. You cannot RSTU once you have hit FRS.All funds contributed via RSTU will be reserved for formation of RA (for CPF life).,btohqsg
I believe SA contributions from employement still goes to SA even if u hit frs. Only MA contributions and interest (assuming u hit.BHS) will overflow to OA,btohqsg
Correct me if i am wrong pls,btohqsg
Yes I think you are correct üëçüèª,btohqsg

My uob one.debit card transaction. Done on 28th Jan.Still shows as pending.Does it always take so long to be posted transaction?,btohqsg
I have used various merchants since 28th Jan. None posted. Usually how long it takes?,btohqsg
Dependent on merchant. Can be same day  can also be 4-5 days. On average usually 2 days for me.,btohqsg
If they wanna take the full 10 business days they can lol.Absolutely not much of a reason for the merchant to process it quick as the money is already transferred to them the moment you spend it.But after 10 days if they don't process it then the transaction will be reversed ü§™,btohqsg
