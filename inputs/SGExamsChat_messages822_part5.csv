phys comp math econs is mine 😐,btohqsg
I guess the tough thing about jc is that you have to cram all the content in 2 years,btohqsg
ok the idea that jc is tougher than uni is honestly bullshit,btohqsg
I mean for Uni u can elect to do so too,btohqsg
that’s what my ft said to us 😭,btohqsg
your mindset when approaching A levels vs uni is different,btohqsg
i mean i found jc more enjoyable sooo,btohqsg
this is exactly what she was implying 😭 oh gosh,btohqsg
The mental shock when you realise your finals are in 4 months,btohqsg
Na it's when it's in 4 weeks,btohqsg
Depends on the amount of fucks given,btohqsg
biggest difference between jc to uni for me is being able to adapt and be resourceful for independent learning,btohqsg
but id wager that 88.75(pw B) + h3 in related course > 90 w/o h3,btohqsg
I only study after week 13,btohqsg
Hey it can be 4 hours or 4 mins for the real pros,btohqsg
Wait this is the hardest part for me sia,btohqsg
then again if ur Pw is the B it means that your grades are alr v good,btohqsg
Because i relied on tuition for most part of jc,btohqsg
and maybe is siaolang drag u down,btohqsg
so idt pw B that life ruining,btohqsg
profs in uni  outside of a few  won't spoon feed you exactly what to say  how to tackle things,btohqsg
you gotta figure it out yourself or at least take initiative to consult them  but even then it's largely on you,btohqsg
Imo it's navigating thru the minefield of admin hell,btohqsg
Most give vague tentative feedback even with consults,btohqsg
some profs will genuinely suck at teaching LOL,btohqsg
And some legit suck at admin,btohqsg
I find the admin one worse,btohqsg
Because nothing spells hell when your prof is supposed to upload course materials 2 weeks overdue,btohqsg
i'll try my best to not suck as a TA lmao,btohqsg
TA imo dun rlly have much power cuz the main discretion is with the prof :/,btohqsg
y’all making uni sound like hell when i’ve seen a lot of hellish stories about poly kids struggling with 💩 teammates,btohqsg
Tru but in my experience usually when the prof is sht u just have to sit down and take it,btohqsg
you get people that don't do shit but also got people that friendly fire you,btohqsg
TA at least I can complain to prof maybe get some concessions,btohqsg
ya but that's the thing between a science major and yours,btohqsg
hopefully I can go to nus or ntu,btohqsg
Pulau ntu is a vibe tho fr,btohqsg
comms is the cannot wear flip flops and shorts faculty,btohqsg
It feels like a place on its own,btohqsg
i like it better than nus and i've spent enough time in both,btohqsg
Everything that happens in NTU STAYS in NTU,btohqsg
Oh one thing going for ntu fr,btohqsg
Wish they had guaranteed fixed hall fees,btohqsg
i just don't like that nus is scattered along the area instead of feeling like a cohesive campus,btohqsg
Whenever I go into NTU I am reminded of the show the Sound of Music,btohqsg
The Hills are alive with the sound of musiccccc,btohqsg
Sharing  especially with those who are into music. Livestreaming tomorrow at 7.30 pmhttps://www.extraordinarypeople.sg,btohqsg
Oh no la. This is a special needs organisation,btohqsg
ok tbh i chose fm bc1. i have interest2. idw chem,btohqsg
i think if u choose fm solely to escape chem u got what's coming to u,btohqsg
