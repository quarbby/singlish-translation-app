Anyone knows a workshop that provides hood pins installation?,btohqsg
Hmm. Actually I have been getting multiple quotes  some from my own trusted workshops that Iâ€™ve been visiting for years  so my rough quote is about 1800 or so..,btohqsg
Iâ€™m waiting till the carâ€™s time is up  which is in a couple years from now so I guess Iâ€™ll still be holding on for a while.,btohqsg
Thanks very much for all your inputs. Not the best at cars so pardon me if I misunderstood anything.,btohqsg
Now itâ€™s in its 13th year and going strong still. Except for this issue that came up recently,btohqsg
Why 15 years.. well. Actually because I was saving for my marriage so I decided to continue for another 5 years  by then I should have finished my wedding and have a bit of savings so I can buy a brand new car.,btohqsg
No. It is fully stock from day 1 :),btohqsg
Whatâ€™s on your mind for the next ride,btohqsg
Probably a Hyundai avante or a Corolla Altis :),btohqsg
Looking for a car with minimal maintenance,btohqsg
Would probably want a harrier but itâ€™s a tad too expensive. Iâ€™m in my mid 20s!,btohqsg
Who knows along the way you get a huge blessing,btohqsg
Haha Iâ€™ll be thankful for that!,btohqsg
Bro u pay in full cash?,btohqsg
Cause you blacked out perhaps the best part of the Avante...,btohqsg
Will do a bigger down payment and monthly instalment. Iâ€™m not wealthy hahaha,btohqsg
gotta say that merc still looks better imo haha,btohqsg
Largely I think Iâ€™m looking for a fuss-free and minimal maintenance ride. Not super into the Brands or anything unless Iâ€™m super wealthy  would just buy a Rolls Royce instead.,btohqsg
u get a smoother engine and better system,btohqsg
but other wise the cn7 still a great car!,btohqsg
But because I travel a lot for leisure  the car will mostly just be more basic transport to work/etc haha,btohqsg
Japanese car is the way to go  cn7 advantage is on their Technology,btohqsg
Yup. Am really just considering the new Altis/Avante,btohqsg
Hyundai have really stepped up on their games these last few years.,btohqsg
but their interior ok la  if uw interior go for the koreans,btohqsg
kia is on top of the game,btohqsg
I have a CN7  I'm impressed by the car Technology.... None of Japanese entry level come close.,btohqsg
Altis drive sucks. avante better. tried both b4,btohqsg
Kia is old base plate  old technology... That's the old hyundai  lousier engine or inefficient engine for latest Kia vs Hyundai Avante.,btohqsg
They are different class of vehicle.,btohqsg
u put Benz logo on Hyundai. it will look premium instantlyðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
It's all about branding  but take out brand and compare just appearance  maybe we have a different poll results ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Hmm. I think driving characteristics may be quite subjective.,btohqsg
But largely my concerns would be> ease of maintenance> cost of maintenance> driving comfort,btohqsg
Iâ€™m in my mid 20s  but I feel old for not being into the racey sporty car life anymore hahaha,btohqsg
Hmm.. if Iâ€™m in for this game  I would easily pick a Hyundai > Kia,btohqsg
Not sure why I would  but I guess Iâ€™m just a bigger fan of Hyundai.,btohqsg
Ah I see youâ€™re an owner of a stinger hahaha. Whoops,btohqsg
Oh then Hyundai. Honeestly the difference between the two is quite minor  mostly the looks and cabin feels now,btohqsg
But I mean.. if Iâ€™m looking for a sporty handling car with good driving characteristics  I wouldnâ€™t be looking at a Toyota/Honda etc. Probably would just save straight and go for a Porsche,btohqsg
But then again like I said  itâ€™s subjective  so to each its own!,btohqsg
I think what matters most is how you look at yourself and what you desire :),btohqsg
still got  Genesis. will kill off the Benz beside immediately,btohqsg
Hyundai parts seems a lot easier to get in SG than Kia. Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong,btohqsg
As much as what people say.. Honestly Hyundai and Kia parts are reeally the same. They share tons of parts cause they are under Hyundai anyways,btohqsg
I drive a lot overseas.. or at least I think I do(?)  may be wrong  but I think driving is about it being relaxing after all these years of driving. Unless Iâ€™m at a track  of course.,btohqsg
So not a super huge fan of sporty cars haha. Maybe Iâ€™m getting older..,btohqsg
My friends around me drives sporty cars,btohqsg
But then they look at me and say erm.. hahaha so I guess itâ€™s just me.,btohqsg
Cerato and Avante can't go wrong. They are the same class of vehicle  same target audience just targets different look.,btohqsg
