I gg start job hunting alr but to be honest I don't really have my hopes up too high,btohqsg
Business is honestly the most useless major I feel.........,btohqsg
Get a good internship that‚Äôs key,btohqsg
Business can work in fund management  and banks and earn big bucks by being moneymaker and punish retailers,btohqsg
So this holidays I no intern. So I decided to work on what I'm deficient at. Languages (Chinese  French)  software like Tableau etc,btohqsg

I was thinking of taking my licence this holidays. Since I alr got military licence shld be okay to pass,btohqsg
I tried applying but all didn't get back... And some I just don't qualify because I dont have the skills. In poly I did aviation but of course now all up lorry no one hiring in the industry...,btohqsg
Not getting an intern I don't think is the end of the world bah... Cos I did do one in poly and last semester I worked part time during the sem too. So my CV luckily isn't empty.,btohqsg
Aviation will have good prospects in future.,btohqsg
Internship don‚Äôt need relevant skill one,btohqsg
But I feel I lack skills more than work experience at this point. That's why I'm not too hard up on not doing intern. Cos so many positions when I was in the process of applying  I just didn't qualify cos I don't know some software etc,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a matter of Heng suay and finding a hirer that need someone (anyone!) so don‚Äôt give up,btohqsg
