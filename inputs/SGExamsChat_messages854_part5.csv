I tot wld be only private degrees or smth,btohqsg
To be fair  ntu was a chinese speaking school in the past,btohqsg
The gov merge a chinese spealing sch and a eng speaking sch,btohqsg
And they really wanna make it chinese speaking,btohqsg
But even since someone asked me if ntu is a chinese school,btohqsg
I am starting to feel like it is becoming one,btohqsg
last week ss canteen was insane,btohqsg
They removed the pasta stall ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
AND CHANGED IT TO A CHINESE FRIED STALL,btohqsg
I swear they really not solving the lack of halal food issue,btohqsg
the pasta like quite ex so dont really eat,btohqsg
The one that closed down in arnd 2021,btohqsg
feedback to Uni  to get a Sharwarma Arabic stall?,btohqsg
Like I am seeing 3 or 4 China stalls now.,btohqsg
My friend was conplaining to me non stop,btohqsg
At least NTU divide the load equally,btohqsg
if the price is reasonable then sure we can have an arabic stall,btohqsg
Or at least an indian stall,btohqsg
Tbh our double major is truly cut load into 2,btohqsg
Like when we say dbl major we mean double equally,btohqsg
Whereas NUS don't mean it one,btohqsg
i mean engineering + econs is still leaning towards engineering but i guess not a big diff btwn the two,btohqsg
I think the most hardcore one wld be business and comp sci,btohqsg
For dbl degree u still are classified as CoE student what,btohqsg
Tbh i wld have loved ntu to have a science + communications degree tho,btohqsg
ehh. don't really like Indian stalls  after the horrors i seen in Malaysia's mamaks. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I love butter chicken or chicken curry,btohqsg
But at ntu south spine we get the cheapo laksa kind,btohqsg
We rlly need more variety in south spine.,btohqsg
ikr ss eat till sian le,btohqsg
I have to go up and then go down,btohqsg
im thinking whatâ€™s the closest we have,btohqsg
The closest we have is iem,btohqsg
I'm not rlly a hard core fan of engineering,btohqsg
not really all circuits laâ€¦got software  comms  media processing,btohqsg
What's wrong with AI and Society,btohqsg
Doesnt rlly suit the comms side,btohqsg
The society side has comm mods..,btohqsg
Bruh imo IEM is less of Comms than AI and Society,btohqsg
Cuz AI and Society actually can take WKW mods,btohqsg
Nah man iem is closer than ai and society,btohqsg
The only thing stopping me from iem,btohqsg
Is the option of removing fyp,btohqsg
means you want to skip FYP?,btohqsg
Just the option of skipping fyp,btohqsg
At least when it comes closer to y3 or y4 then i get to choose whether i want to do fyp,btohqsg
For spms  we dont rlly need to do fyp  we can just replace the fyp with internship,btohqsg
well  if your advisors are kinda useless  without proper guidance  just better throw that out the window. lol,btohqsg
Is more of a choice haha,btohqsg
but NTU I doubt it lol,btohqsg
