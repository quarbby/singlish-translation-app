And this too from the same question,btohqsg
Hmm go through the diff q types in each topic,btohqsg
I NEED THEM FOR NEXT SEMESTER,btohqsg
Like equation of circles‚Ä¶ questions on reflection of circle  finding centre of circle from tangent at one point and normal at another point (all normals pass through centre of circle) 2 points with same x-coordinate  hence forming vertical chord. Make use of ‚Äúperpendicular bisector of chord passes through centre of circle‚Äù to find midpoint coordinates  and find coordinates of Centre‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
For binomial theorem Finding term independent of x. Use formula for (r+1)th term‚Ä¶ equate x term to x^0 term  find r. Sub r into the expressionFor eg  find x^4 term. (1-x)^2(2 + 3x)^6 for eg‚Ä¶ expand the left one  and expand the right to get the terms that will pair with those on the left to find x^4 terms. Add up the coefficients for the answer‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Look through diff q types. How to solveA-math q are crafted in parts to help you solve subsequent parts. For example  in q on area under curve  they would ask you to find coordinates of points of intersections firstFor trigo R-formula questions  they would start with ‚Äúshow‚Äù question  then express using R-formula  then find max value‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Trigo proving q‚Ä¶ use diff techniques‚Ä¶ if can‚Äôt prove  go on to solve the trigo equation based on the result to show or prove,btohqsg
A-math q guides you. They provide instructions for you to guide you through. Such instructions will be lacking in jc math,btohqsg
Questions like show that the function is increasing or decreasing‚Ä¶ look out for squared terms‚Ä¶ because squared term is always positive,btohqsg
ok cos all the printed stuff are those i printed frm the soft copies on mel  none of it is extra materials,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt really give an answer to that,btohqsg
But I recommend change the color,btohqsg
after everyone in the block wakes up there will confirm be at least a few who know,btohqsg
Next time just burn the paper away. Liddat dunnid do alrd üòÇ,btohqsg
Who asking for resume? I can provide some examples,btohqsg
