Then u solve it by putting ur phone away more and talking to more people,btohqsg
honestly when you are younger  savings will definitely be lesser and all these come to mind,btohqsg
Everyone sooner or later shld get an aha moment,btohqsg
But also sometimes there's something called influence. Solving it individually may spark influence,btohqsg
when you worked like 10 years  and have been prudent  these stuff are not going to matter much,btohqsg
Where they see the way forward,btohqsg
Then aft that u will see life fall into place slowly as long as u are acting on it,btohqsg
Usually for guys its during NS ahahaha,btohqsg
Thats y I honestly thank god for 2 yrs,btohqsg
I managed to sort my shit out,btohqsg
Like what do u like about it,btohqsg
And figure out what i want in life,btohqsg
2 years of time to think,btohqsg
I still communicate with them on WhatsApp group chat,btohqsg
That's something u like about NS isn't it,btohqsg
I was in q a elitist bubble ah,btohqsg
my NS was 2002 to 2004,btohqsg
I say I old uncle liao mah,btohqsg
2004  1 month after I ORD  NS changed to 2 years,btohqsg
Its always good to meet ppl frm different circles,btohqsg
At least NS prob changed their mind of the world ahead of them,btohqsg
Not like ur sch shows how smart you are,btohqsg
I mean like as long as u are educated and respectful that's more than enuff.,btohqsg
If u say they are snobby people then that's another problem,btohqsg
like I always tell my students  the main difference is good students are much more hardworking and disciplined.,btohqsg
I ever seen students said they studied very hard for exams  and their definition of study hard was they studied overnight,btohqsg
To be fair that's probably studying very hard for em,btohqsg
ya and because of that they expected A1,btohqsg
That's impossible unless they are ayanokouji,btohqsg
It's called working hard because it's done over a long period of time,btohqsg
so we have to be smart,btohqsg
It's like in the past  everyone consumes content through television and maybe radio and newspapers???,btohqsg
Nowadays there is so many options,btohqsg
like I tell my students  I do maths on the 1+ hr bus ride home everyday.1h bus ride Ã— 5 days a week Ã— 40 weeks Ã— 2 years = 400 extra hours of work.if spend time on smart phone  that's 400 hours on phone,btohqsg
And the thing about smartphone is that we get to choose what to watch?,btohqsg
I mean if u take away holidays prob will be lesser,btohqsg
Just need to learn to pick and choose,btohqsg
Last time is need to know how to find,btohqsg
Like let's say currently I'm a boxing fanatic,btohqsg
Now is need to know what to find,btohqsg
I watch vids of boxing on my phone,btohqsg
Knowing what to Google is a skill in itself ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
But because of this I don't watch news or maybe don't search up other stuff it's a waste?,btohqsg
If I use my phone for a long time,btohqsg
Nowadays I also lazy to study,btohqsg
U dun need to study everyday but u need to learn,btohqsg
Phones and internet by extension is as much of a blessing as it is a curse,btohqsg
I try to learn smth everyday,btohqsg
The feeling of progress is addicting,btohqsg
like now I'm in hospital accompanying my dad for medical checkup. I could be reading a book but I'm too lazy to do so,btohqsg
