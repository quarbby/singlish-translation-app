Or maybe it‚Äôs really just trash,btohqsg

[BREAKING] McDonald‚Äôs Singapore Closes All Outlets To Curb Covid-19 Spread Till 4 May 2020Store Closures:11am  19 Apr (today)Last Orders:- Drive Thru - 8am- McDelivery - 10.30amhttps://mustsharenews.com/mcdonalds-singapore-closes/?utm=telegram,btohqsg
HAHAHA there's always KFC  Burger King,btohqsg
Next is close all fast food outlets,btohqsg
Most have elderly people working. Quite risky,btohqsg
I have seen you irl  of cos,btohqsg
Comparing KFC and Macs is like comparing the freshness of an Apple against the freshness of an Orange,btohqsg
Both Apple and Oranges are fruits,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs a fair comparison then,btohqsg
No they‚Äôre not if you read them in context,btohqsg
I feel so insecure about my arms now,btohqsg

no ads  any ads shld go through an admin,btohqsg
I really think it is common sense not to post ads when you join a group,btohqsg
If someone does it I assume he/she is doing it in bad faith until proven otherwise,btohqsg
Pofma just got used to take down some HWZ user‚Äôs post,btohqsg
Apparently it‚Äôs some post about HC earning about $100m,btohqsg

Hello SGExammists  this is an official informal message,btohqsg
MOE is looking for students to share their HBL experiences and how they‚Äôre coping  and relevant humourous things to say. Got to be ok with having your face and name public. Anyone interested?,btohqsg
Same BAHAHA but on my own I'll try to eat vegetarian/vegan food as much as I can,btohqsg
That‚Äôs one of the actual bullet points,btohqsg
gib honest review to MOE... 1 out of 5 stars,btohqsg
Well  they didn‚Äôt say that you can‚Äôt share negative opinions,btohqsg
invalid link. if you want to share your notes  you can upload them onexams.sg/library,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionare you planning to get the switch,btohqsg
There aren‚Äôt really any interesting things on it for me  other than smash,btohqsg
Little did you know John Smith is a furry,btohqsg
I just built nook's cranny lol,btohqsg
my progress in the game is damn slow,btohqsg
once you get the town hall  things will begin to change,btohqsg
imagine being able to use ur switch,btohqsg
did you start playing cause i intro it,btohqsg
I had it in mind for awhile,btohqsg
Wah u want expose ur identity arh,btohqsg
Doesnt sound like itll be that beneficial for portfolio either,btohqsg
You got to be comfortable having ur face and name online,btohqsg
‚Äúcontributed critical analysis on HBL structural framework and execution that led to direct change in MOE‚Äôs policies on online learning,btohqsg
Hmm sounds good but lemme think if its worth,btohqsg
Is there like a deadline for it,btohqsg
hahaha anything is good if you know how to smoke,btohqsg
Although it‚Äôs best to decide fast,btohqsg
I‚Äôll let the relevant people know,btohqsg
And then they‚Äôll contact you or something,btohqsg
I know this is uncomfortable  but what often happens is people who have good things to say volunteer  then say good things and things don't get better. The people who have real concerns and issues don't want to volunteer  the MOE think they're doing a good job and nothing changes.If you feel like you don't have good things to say  I would encourage you with the perspective that this may be one way to actually make things better.,btohqsg
LOL hi moe should check out my HBL vlog =),btohqsg
Vlog is a bannable offence in sgexams,btohqsg
According to section 7(1) of sgexams constituition,btohqsg
I want you to fuck up my nights,btohqsg
I think they‚Äôre looking more for people to use their comments and image to make their own social media posts,btohqsg
Sad u havnt saved my contact,btohqsg
who knows  maybe MOE may feature your vlog!!!!,btohqsg
‚ÄúNot that online meetings mean less  but they‚Äôre just not the same.‚Äù8 recovering addicts tell CNA Insider of their challenges to stay clean as they go without physical counselling and group sessions during Singapore‚Äôs ‚Äúcircuit breaker‚Äù period.https://cna.asia/2xzwz2R,btohqsg
As in  they want to use your image and comments to make their own social media post  and if you‚Äôre fine with that you can volunteer to do so,btohqsg
Not sure if this is any clearer,btohqsg
But u can check out their Instagram for examples of what they probably want to do,btohqsg
Uk i was looking for ur reply,btohqsg
Someone asked what does ‚Äútext‚Äù means,btohqsg
Then i replied with the same text,btohqsg
Thats how i see what u just wrote,btohqsg
It is also how I see what I just wrote,btohqsg
hi is there an admin here?,btohqsg
you mind if i message you?,btohqsg
All this time i thought your prof pic was a cup of coffee with a face,btohqsg
I‚Äôm trying very hard to see the cup,btohqsg
Time to open up to different perspectives  john,btohqsg
I never zoomed into your photo before,btohqsg
Im still trying to find that reply from john,btohqsg
Why would i delete ur reply,btohqsg
Well at least u can relate unlike bio,btohqsg
What if he says ur gay,btohqsg
Tjen it would be a priori,btohqsg
I feel like an inferior bio cuck,btohqsg
does anyone know how to get into the zoom calls by NUS today,btohqsg
I signed up but there‚Äôs no link or anything,btohqsg
They send u a link via email,btohqsg
u have to click on it and wait,btohqsg
When ur time comes theyll automatically accept u,btohqsg
Do different faculties start at different times,btohqsg
But they send u an email,btohqsg
Okay they didn‚Äôt send it to me :/,btohqsg
At least u all got zoom interview,btohqsg
Omg so unfair to u 111!1!1!1!1!1!11,btohqsg
I tot u were discussing about rc interview a few days ago,btohqsg
Comp sci not ur thing anymre ?,btohqsg
I figured if i went cs i cant teach science anymore on the side,btohqsg
Then maybe u couldve used the superior bio knowledge on corona to research proteins,btohqsg
Would u hire someone who majors in cs to teach you chem?,btohqsg
Actually why can‚Äôt you just second major Chem,btohqsg
I do H3 until I wanna die alr,btohqsg
Students this is called reparations in action,btohqsg
And thats in the first mod,btohqsg
Ya doesnt take long to understand,btohqsg
that's why idrw to do full on chem,btohqsg
U can specialise in that under chem tho,btohqsg
physical chem doesn't appeal to me at all,btohqsg
These 2 majors dont complement each other,btohqsg
Oh  it would be a DDP,btohqsg
Cs and math makes more sense,btohqsg
Under student combinations for double major,btohqsg
Ya but it dosent really help unless u do chem for sole interest,btohqsg
If things go well I may take second degree Lit,btohqsg
Applied isn‚Äôt very interesting compared to pure,btohqsg
Gonna see a philosophical math prof soon,btohqsg
Lots of hard core prof in math,btohqsg
Maths is just another face of philosophy,btohqsg
people choose to agree that math exists.,btohqsg
Just like how people choose to agree that govt has power over them,btohqsg
I cannot see my maths paper coz it doesnt exist,btohqsg
Maths and philosophy are both constructs,btohqsg
I cannot write on my maths paper coz my electrons and pens electrons repel,btohqsg
As i was lookin thru the 2017 a lvl qn papers chucked in my cupboard,btohqsg
I still have my O Levels Lit paper,btohqsg
U really have nth to do,btohqsg
I still have my 2015 o lvl pure geog paper insert,btohqsg
I still have my N level 2016 poa paper,btohqsg
Its nice af because its in colour,btohqsg
So i have no idea how i got it,btohqsg
Wtf you have a real life Pepe,btohqsg
Exercise more so that you have more to eat!,btohqsg
Best way to lose weight is fall sick,btohqsg
You dont have to force yourself to do exercise or eat,btohqsg
There is a scientific backing for something similar to this,btohqsg
Wait let me find the paper,btohqsg
More like it should be Duh,btohqsg
I dont see many weightloss trainers or professionals taking this into account when calculating,btohqsg
Maybe because on a second note its just a surface study,btohqsg
Exercise more so that you have more to eat!,btohqsg
Exercise more so that you have more to eat!,btohqsg
Can MOE handle our level of humour though,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionbtw can I have the link to the server where I can ask questions,btohqsg

BREAKING:Singapore reports 1 426 new COVID-19 cases  the vast majority of whom are foreign workers living in dormitories. ‚ñ∂Ô∏èhttps://cna.asia/3bpiAuP,btohqsg
boutta get on my sampan and start paddling to pulau tekong at this rate,btohqsg
"They'll be like  ""foreign workers only  not locals""",btohqsg
china open up now their cases rise again,btohqsg
i think they will open up a few days,btohqsg
then go back to lockdown again,btohqsg
need to stock up on non-essential supplies,btohqsg
also closing for 2 months straight might kill or cripple a lot of small businesses,btohqsg
so if the community cases drop to negligible numbers next week got chance open for a few days,btohqsg
if still high or increasing then probably just extend,btohqsg
i heard even some mega companies went bankrupt cuz of this,btohqsg
Literally had friends do something similar  developing software that makes work in chemistry more simple  more engaging  more easy.,btohqsg
Surely it has to go down from here,btohqsg
Complentariness exists as long as you can see how it can exist. Arts + CS = VR? Again  friends in that background but traditionally not complementary.,btohqsg
Inb4@cauchycriteriontakes a double degree in pure mathematics and philosophy,btohqsg
CS is usually done with math or biz,btohqsg
Maybe I‚Äôll take a philosophy mod and see if I like it,btohqsg
I think we should be mentally prepared for a wave 2 of covid-19,btohqsg

Mr. William Chew has 200 IQ,btohqsg
He has solved the covid 19 pandemic,btohqsg
People are getting infected on purpose,btohqsg
What about‚ÄúI used to follow my mom when I was younger  now I don‚Äôt anymore  but that one special occasion that I actually tagged along last year  I realise that it‚Äôs not as crowded as it used to be  so that part of me that hated the very crowded wet market  doesn‚Äôt anymore but I couldn‚Äôt find a reason to go after that  although kinda wanna go for the vibe‚ÄùBahaha,btohqsg
Yes because people definitely want to die ON PURPOSE,btohqsg
Imagine being so xenophobic and/or intellectually disabled that you think people get infected by a potentially fatal disease just to 'avoid work',btohqsg
Hey don‚Äôt insult the intellectually disabled,btohqsg
Which is why Facebook is a place for intellectuals to gather,btohqsg
But in all crisises there will always be weird kinds of thinking,btohqsg
I just wonder where they got it from,btohqsg
i think in all scenarios there'll always be werd ppl,btohqsg
The foreign workers are not earning as much as they usually earn  and that money is supposed to be sent back to their family toliterally stop them from starving  but Mr. William thinks they're just lazy and don't want to work,btohqsg
They must have thought VERY HARD,btohqsg
Ugh I remember one commenter on live chat of One World: Together at Home‚ÄúIs it just going to be ‚Äòthank you healthcare workers‚Äô and ‚Äòthere are homeless people‚Äô from now on?‚Äù When they take a break from the performances to raise awareness.,btohqsg
BMT recruits banded together to get the covids into Singapore,btohqsg

Lady Gaga curated online concert of celebrities from around the world  while it did include Asian representation  you can‚Äôt deny that it is very western-centric and the fact that Asian lineup were added later.,btohqsg
tbh math and philo got intersect one leh,btohqsg
Doublee degree  each degree is a double major,btohqsg
Math + comp Sci  Philo + lit,btohqsg
You mean concurrent degree (direct masters) with a double major in bachelors,btohqsg
The C in CL stands for C,btohqsg
The B in CLB stands for B ^_^,btohqsg
The A in CL or CLB is missing,btohqsg
Authorities call for more blood donations as supplies drop to critical levels during circuit breakerBlood collection in the first week of the circuit breaker period dipped to less than a quarter of usual levels. This drop will lead to blood stocks falling far below the daily amount required to supply transfusion needs from surgeries  general medicine  and accident and emergency cases  said the Singapore Red Cross.‚ô•Ô∏èhttps://tdy.sg/2VFFMhV,btohqsg
I would go for the blood donation,btohqsg
