The funny thing is the doctor linked this up w my medical condition,btohqsg
It is not obv fr the outside one,btohqsg
if adhd she might be in special needs sch,btohqsg
i legit went to counseling the doctor told me deadass i dont have ad,btohqsg
Actually i was puzzled when i realised this was a thing,btohqsg
and because i only had hd  it could not be written as a medical condition for school,btohqsg
No as in i was puzzled there is such a condition,btohqsg
can apply for access arrangement ah,btohqsg
wait so its a personality disorder?,btohqsg
But not in uni and hence i cant finish my papers,btohqsg
anyways AA would not have done shit for me tbh..i finish my papers literally 15-30mins before handups ðŸ˜¶ðŸ« ,btohqsg
I would not hv finished by papers without AA,btohqsg
Yeah i have no clue wat it is,btohqsg
Just that it sucks to do ur papers away fr ur classmates,btohqsg
what sucks is when their paper ends and you hear them walking by your class,btohqsg
or the faint sounds of them in the school which you can hear from the AA class,btohqsg
My sch the AA rm is far fr the rest,btohqsg
then they discuss answers in front of u,btohqsg
u hear them and like oh thats the ans,btohqsg
and for practicals in sec sch,btohqsg
The practicals AA is always the last shift,btohqsg
The teacher for o lvls pract was so confused on what he gotta do,btohqsg
Some ppl think of it as an advantage for us,btohqsg
My dad wanted to apply AA practical assistance for me,btohqsg
actually how much more time yall have ah,btohqsg
I didnt want coz i paiseh,btohqsg
"For practical they were like ""wait u cant handle sharps is this even allowed?""",btohqsg
But what do practical assistance do,btohqsg
Bunsen burner and glass object included,btohqsg
Mine is cause i can blank out any moment,btohqsg
So did u hv someone to handle those for u?,btohqsg
so they dont allow me touch fragile and potentially sharp objects,btohqsg
the invigilator will handle for me if necessary,btohqsg
and if i blank out they need prompt me,btohqsg
The one time I've seen Aa,btohqsg
Take place was when a chem cher helped a student do their titration,btohqsg
Like fainting with eyes open and standingðŸ’€,btohqsg
Like the cher helped him stop at the correct spot,btohqsg
Mine is coz i have some coordination problem,btohqsg
Our practical not rlly counted tho,btohqsg
oh yea thats usually what they do,btohqsg
theres a asterisk beside the subjects with practical,btohqsg
I think it is a +,btohqsg
I mean i never faint lah its js space out,btohqsg
hmmm maybe thats why ur job interview gg,btohqsg
"""My answer is correct cause the cher stopped at the right place""",btohqsg
