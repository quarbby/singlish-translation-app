also how long was the queue on Wed/Thursday?,btohqsg
Hi  for the hfe letter  would it be possible to manually enter occupier information instead of having to get them to log in via Singpass?,btohqsg
You'll need an appointment to be able get past the staff manning the entrance,btohqsg
I don't think you can enter without an appointment letter/SMS from hdb,btohqsg
past few days I heard no need appt to go downthey made an except,btohqsg
It's not possible. This is to prevent us from anyhow filling occupier information. That's why need their Singpass,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I confirm that if I apply for SBF  I can only choose which area and flat type - I have no control over whether I am bidding for a flat that is immediately available or in a few years time?,btohqsg
Anyone stuck at the payment page while submitting an application?,btohqsg
you can choose the area after you look at the units‚Äô lease period and completion date ma,btohqsg
Yeah but for the same area there may be different lease periods and completion dates isit?,btohqsg
So I might end up w a unit that does not align w my timeline correct,btohqsg
its first come first serve in area depending on your number.,btohqsg
so just get the queue number first,btohqsg
Does anyone know whens the TOP date for Garden Court tengah,btohqsg
anyone has clues as to which part of august will the Aug 2023 BTO be open for application? or at least more info to read thru to consider application??,btohqsg

Hello! Does anyone know if we will eventually get to select which of the two projects we want from the current Tengah BTO?,btohqsg
u get to choose from both plots when it‚Äôs your turn to select  given there is still unselected units and ethnic quota not reached,btohqsg
LOL bro give others a chance lah üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
"meaning can or cannot?Btw it was due to unforeseen circumstances that such a move had to be made  not that it was wanted in order to ""earn"" monies. It was a difficult move.The first flat is now otw to be acquired.",btohqsg
I think can purchase up to 2 time bto.Better call up HDB to confirm this,btohqsg
2x BTO only... But... Ther is a chance to be 1st time if a couple one is 1st timer n the other is 2nd timer  then e couple will consider as 1st timer ü§£This cfm coz tiz juz happen to my fren who apply feb bto  he tot he 2nd timer  but hdb letter stated bcoz his wife is 1st timer  so they consider as 1st timer...All these yr many tot if one party is 2nd timer mean is consider 2nd timer... N tat wat i tot too,btohqsg
Yes  this happened to me as well.My hubby is a 2nd timer  brought a resale flat with ex while im 1st timer.We are considered as 1st timer. Ehg half grant  resale levy after flat sold is half as well  20k instead of 40k.,btohqsg

how big is your plot? taking nov 2022 launch for reference  bukit batok bto (200+ 4r units) took about 2 weeks to reach q90  queenstown btos (2400+ 4r units) and tengah btos (700+ units) took about 3 weeks to reach q90  kallang bto (400+ 4r units) took about 5 weeks to reach q90,btohqsg
but u can estimate abt a month from the first gro appt  then it will reach your turn,btohqsg

Does anyone knows when Aug 2022 BTO will be released as SBF?,btohqsg
tbh nobody knows the answer  only HDB knows,btohqsg
Quick question. How will i know if my bto is delayed?,btohqsg
Hello  wonder if anyone is facing the same issue  during submission of hfe letter  my fianc√© was not employed during the a small part of the period (May 22 - May 23) that hdb requested. But hdb still request documents for those months  so not sure what documents should be submitted?,btohqsg
Just attach a txt file stating the period not working,btohqsg
Horrific experience before the red lifts. Tiktoker shared his encounter when he visited the TOP Tampines GreenVines.Recently  videos of the Tampines GreenVines BTO made their rounds online once again. These videos  were a compilation of images which were taken when the project reached TOP.  Although at first sight  you might not believe the building belongs to a public housing estate in Singapore.You might be wondering what TOP is. TOP  also‚Ä¶https://www.sghomeguides.com/horrific-experience-before-the-red-lifts-at-tampines-greenvines/,btohqsg
Hi everyone  can I check if there is a telegram group chat for Tampines Green Quartz,btohqsg

If HLE expires after unit selected but haven't sign agreement for lease  does it mean need to reapply HLE once more before the agreement for lease appointment date?,btohqsg

üè° POV: You just applied for a BTO  what now?Now that BTO applications have ended  here are some tips from me (based on my experience)1Ô∏è‚É£Check your inbox dailyApplication results typically come out withing 6-8 weeks  if there's a delay  HDB will notify you in advance2Ô∏è‚É£ Have hard conversations with your significant otherLike a broken recorder -- I will remind everyone again that you need to have honest conversations with your significant other about financial planning and contingency plans3Ô∏è‚É£BONUS: if you are kiasu like me  you can join theBTO groupswhere people who have applied for the same project hold discussions.I would highly recommend everyone to join as it gives you a deeper understanding about the project. However  do take the opinions in the group with a pinch of salt and come up with you own judgement.Group linksBedok South Blossom--https://t.me/Bedokmay2023BTOSerangoon North Vista--https://t.me/serangoonmay2023btoFarrer Park Arena--https://t.me/kallangwhampoamay2023btoParc meadow @ Tengah and Plantation Verge--https://t.me/tengahmay2023bto,btohqsg
