S20 prolly better than the plus,btohqsg
Cuz the phone camera and processor And battery got a fuck ton of issues,btohqsg
i quit apple after ip7 plus,btohqsg
For starters  100x zoom isn't practical,btohqsg
I'm a Samsung fanboy who recommends Samsung to everyone  and this time I'm telling people not to get it,btohqsg
i dont have a phone rn,btohqsg
It's weird  and only practical if you're a stalker,btohqsg
But yeah ultra is absolutely not worth it,btohqsg
Get a burner phone until something good comes out,btohqsg
Note 10 if you can live without the jack,btohqsg
but do specs rly matter though,btohqsg
you can try iPhone 11  it is really good for a phone,btohqsg
I'm hoping for Note 20 or Pixel 5,btohqsg
I hope it doesn't disappoint me as much as Pixel 4,btohqsg
Pixel 5 is gonna come with SD765  so it's officially mid-range,btohqsg
I can only recommend the 11,btohqsg
21 only comes out next year XD,btohqsg
i saw the new samsung 6000mah battery,btohqsg
I'm not looking for a new phone this year,btohqsg
Oh you're keeping until next year,btohqsg
although I miss S9 and note 9 design,btohqsg
Yeah good thing  since the market is fucked up now,btohqsg
the 6000mah power battery phone is only 450 dollars,btohqsg
2 months NS pay = one note 10,btohqsg
Just buy after you POP  cuz you'll be promoted  so more pay,btohqsg
Could use a budget phone till a good one comes out,btohqsg
I just need a new case and protector for my note 9,btohqsg
That one can lah  $630 should cover it,btohqsg
walau i think im getting convinced HAHAHA,btohqsg
can it last me for 4 years,btohqsg
around the same or less than S20,btohqsg
barely any Android phones are supported for more than 3 years,btohqsg
Got it xmas 2017 and it was a year old by then,btohqsg
To be honest  they just had to change their batteries,btohqsg
aight i guess im getting the ip11 ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
Good choice for this climate tbh,btohqsg
Also an awesome phone  it can last,btohqsg

128GB storage for good futureproof measures,btohqsg

My storage is perpetually full bc of my 30k images and videos,btohqsg
Telegram eats a lot of space actually,btohqsg
"13 G of my computer storage was ""other"" until I realised it was telegram",btohqsg
Cos I didn't know you could set the data and storage options to clear periodically,btohqsg
sry i sound like a boomer but do students get discount for apple prodcuts,btohqsg
As telegram ate up 8gb of my phone storage,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s like this ipad for students thing if I recall,btohqsg
But idk at which level of study are you qualified for it,btohqsg
Ipad is just for people who think they are saving money by not buying paper but they actually spend more,btohqsg
You need to go into telegram settings and choose the option to keep media not permanently,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t do that until a week or 2 ago,btohqsg
anyone has any non-combat non-fps non-competitive steam game recommendations,btohqsg

I have zero doubt that theyâ€™re not gonna take this announcement into account for us,btohqsg
BMT is just postponed for u,btohqsg
Complaining to my course lead :(,btohqsg
John Smith must be angry to use profanities,btohqsg
at least it's one month deducted from ord date,btohqsg
I have no doubt that AFTC higher ups knew about this decision from mindef,btohqsg
And they still fed us bullshit about BMT,btohqsg
