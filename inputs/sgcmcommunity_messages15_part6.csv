the founder series should be out soon,btohqsg
model s just nice for me as a fmaily sedan,btohqsg
Thought it was meant to be out a while back,btohqsg
Ya man i Check with the sales they said around 2 years now all over demand   even model y delay and waiting time in Australia over 1 year,btohqsg
I think is the chip and battery issue,btohqsg
Same for all other brand of cars,btohqsg
Over demand or Haven't started production  Elon said start in 2023 only,btohqsg
i not saying about roadster that 1 is sure over 1 m in sg,btohqsg
now tesla is facing over demand issue in the whole world,btohqsg
that why they keep raise the price month by month,btohqsg
Generally Tesla models a bit delayed  due to the claims made then need to rework again to make sure they meet them,btohqsg
yup it is not easy to do mass production,btohqsg
cybertruck and roadster delayed for 2 years liao,btohqsg
they cant meet demands for their cars. but with austin and berlin in full production mode  cybertrucks will be produced next year,btohqsg
this will be a hot seller. many bookings already,btohqsg
I feel that the Ford f150 lightning  hummer ev and Rivian r1t are good competitors as well,btohqsg
ooh yeh that rivian is sick,btohqsg
Rivian has started deliveries now and ford has the faith of most consumers in the States,btohqsg
Plus the rivian is using a skateboard platform which will make it easy for other companies to buy that platform and develop their vehicles on it or for rivian to make other cars,btohqsg
hopefully this come in rhd too,btohqsg
Sadly too big for Singapore :(,btohqsg
Like the jeep gladiator is already too big for our roads,btohqsg
ford just sold alot of rivian shares,btohqsg
to me tesla strongest competitor is byd,btohqsg
Since borders are open  will you be going Sepang to really go on track with other cars properly instead of only red light victories alone when probably no one else around is looking for that?,btohqsg
Went alredy problem is sepang no charger,btohqsg
Can only do 3 laps then have to go away and charge,btohqsg
good point.. where is the nearest charge point from Sepang?,btohqsg
How was the experience running the car on track?,btohqsg
Not me running   I haven’t drive to Malaysia yet   is seeing car club pplWent there for field report can share some wait ar,btohqsg
oh come on. surely you can find a charge in KL. lots of teslas in KL,btohqsg
use google map top find la. so many,btohqsg
What’s your lap time? Can you do 2 min 15,btohqsg
sir sepang is an hour frm KL,btohqsg
Aiyo. There are many chargers there. You just have to plan nicely. Surely don’t have to come back to singapore to charge,btohqsg
hahaha ya but no need go back KL luh,btohqsg
"Fastest timed lap (3 people inside  battery red! and power down) was 3 min 00.994 secThe battery started at 79% we did 8 laps  battery at 37.5%  averaging 5.18% per lap if you include cold laps. During hot laps  7% per lap.Car was steady  balance good  no snap oversteer. Astounding was braking distance was very very short  even at 205kmh at turn 1  can brake at 160m I think. So I consistently braked too early for this car.But definitely this car needs to lower 1.5 inches to 2 inches  need 20"" tyres or higher tyre pressure than 3.2 bar. Brakes with performance pads didn't even get super hot actually.Battery turned RED after 2 laps  precisely at turn 2 lap 3. Power degraded. Rear motor is next to turn yellow. Sepang is really hot!Acceleration is incredible fast but need colder climate.",btohqsg
This one is leisurely drive with a passenger inside. He’s taking it easy,btohqsg
You need to use the brake pedal or single pedal let go good to brake?,btohqsg
Deceleration should regenerate power to battery right,btohqsg
Should do lap time with just you driving,btohqsg
Can decelerate in turn one? Say coming at 220,btohqsg
This is a friend field report,btohqsg
After one lap abs then you continue that turn 1 will have high speed,btohqsg
Nice leisurely drive lah.. no wonder quite far from the usual closer to 2min from performance cars. Some of them really quite scary.. Low 2mins one. That one my two round things also shrink,btohqsg
Stock car vs mod car things,btohqsg
Skill also do the major part,btohqsg
Airport sepang klia is nearest to charge,btohqsg
I’d think it can easily do 2 min 30 seconds or better.,btohqsg
I go when charger is there,btohqsg
