What's the diff between USB c and thunderbolt,btohqsg
USB C is a type of connectorlike micro USB is actually USB Micro Bthe usual computer one is USB Athunderbolt is a hardware interface by Intel that allows wtv u connect to have direct access to PCIe lanes while also acting as a DisplayPortand because it can directly tap on PCIe lanes  it can support stuff like external GPUs,btohqsg
Thunderbolt 1 & 2 actually used mini display port as its connectoronly Thunderbolt 3 & 4 uses USB C,btohqsg
So that mini displayport connector on my old laptop,btohqsg
Can actually be used as thunderbolt?,btohqsg
wait how does remote desktop work for individuals,btohqsg
It needs to explicitly have thunderbolt support,btohqsg
it just shares the desktop from the host to the client computer,btohqsg
u setup remote desktop (parsec  TeamViewer  wtv) to be able to allow remote connections without anyone needing to press allow on the host side,btohqsg
typically remote desktop solutions like TeamViewer or AnyDesk will encrypt the data  then route it through their servers such that it reaches you,btohqsg
so usually this can only happen if both sides are connected to the same account  otherwise it's insecure as fuck,btohqsg
ahhh so what are the advantages of this for students?,btohqsg
if you're working with multiple computers it can be useful,btohqsg
you can also use it to transfer files to and from computers,btohqsg
Or like mentioned before  you can have a powerful computer and a relatively cheap/weak laptop,btohqsg
Whenever you need your desktop to do some stuff you can just remote in and work,btohqsg
ok wait i noob one ah  but i can just get a desktop at home (which for equivalent specs is much cheaper than a laptop) then i just use a cheapo laptop when im working outside but still get the same computing power as my desktop at home?,btohqsg
wah then why dont more ppl do this?,btohqsg
Assuming you have a internet connection,btohqsg
It's not exactly required for most work flows,btohqsg
plus is singapore is like everywhere got connection,btohqsg
if i can donate my gbs to u i would la,btohqsg
Like if you're just doing excel and word your laptop will work just fine,btohqsg
and it's not exactly intuitive to implement it into any random Joe's workflow,btohqsg
U can just donate the $$,btohqsg
mine is like 18 for 50gb?,btohqsg
data is cheap   but the amount of data u need to download/store stuff makes it expensive in the long run,btohqsg
Oh and yeah you need set up a bit,btohqsg
Cause if computer sleeps you probably can't remote desktop unless you enable wake on lan,btohqsg
and wake on LAN is a bitch,btohqsg
You can rent a server online without having the actual hardware,btohqsg
or u can just download more RAM,btohqsg
anyone can give tips for eae writeup pls,btohqsg
And write why you wanna go,btohqsg
And write what you aim to get out of the course,btohqsg
im in a pretty general course,btohqsg
Yea then just put what do u aim to get out the course in poly,btohqsg
Why does that affect why you want go infocom sec,btohqsg
You can always take part in coms uk -?,btohqsg
There's nothing to be unsure about  being in ITE doesn't mean you cannot want to be in infocom sec,btohqsg
Is SjChO still on this year?,btohqsg
kenna rejected frm NUS comp science ðŸ˜ª,btohqsg
I just lost a potential classmate :(((,btohqsg
were u from poly or a levels,btohqsg
ah  u got thru direct right,btohqsg
my GPA fell short  I was hoping my ABA could save me but it didn't,btohqsg
even last year sem 1 there were offline lessons for cs,btohqsg
What does Ben leong have to do with this,btohqsg
and I'll be pretty irritated if CS is the only fac with in person lessons,btohqsg
i think he's very involved in cs curriculum,btohqsg
