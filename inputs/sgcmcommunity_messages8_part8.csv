Today  u need to go through agent to sell your second hand iPad ? Is called Carousell. Similar concept. The only complication is the financing portion. Well  the bank can charge u an admin fee to settle that. Don‚Äôt need an agent to intro a bank agent to me to repeat myself,btohqsg
Anyway  is just my two cents. Nothing against them. Haha.,btohqsg
I think insurance high chance thou   like direct Asia,btohqsg
Just thought that the idea of ‚Äúservice sector‚Äù will be compressed more as we intro more automation.,btohqsg
Property is hard la cause a lot of pysical presence needed,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why agent are marketing themselves as financial advisor and not Insurance Agent. That‚Äôs like so 2000. Hahah. They need to expand their job scope if not ppl will go online and buy insurance.,btohqsg
Anyway  thanks for replying me. Have a good weekend. My food is here. üòÖüëçüèª,btohqsg
Yeah. More go direct just as insurance purchase. Agents would service in like family office situations or wealth clients,btohqsg
I agree. Yea don‚Äôt need agents to help me do simple purchase of cars.,btohqsg
You can do yourself too. If you want. I typically type my own tenancy agreement. So many templates around. But some may not want to do this,btohqsg
Sad to say most merc drivers have this taitai mind set,btohqsg
One BMW i4 was charging but this guy Haiya.,btohqsg
Must display his car plate gao gao here.,btohqsg
Can only feedback to Security to take action right? Wheelock the punk? Such antisocial behaviour should not be condone at all.,btohqsg
Some place will clamp like katong v mall,btohqsg
Actually is free money the management should really look into placing wheel clamp logo and just clamp,btohqsg
Can give the security some year end bonus,btohqsg
The old EQ series ma lol,btohqsg
Chances are the owner will argue with security and demand to release without paying. Such inconsiderate driver can be uncouth when confronting such situation. As a society  shouldn‚Äôt tolerated at all.,btohqsg
No use 1 I seen ktv Ice been clamp they just go pay the $150,btohqsg
The longer u drag the more parking fee can quarrel all u want,btohqsg
Actually you be surprise if you go directly to bank for car loan   easy and hassle free   and u can choose 3-7 years and down as many as u want,btohqsg
hi any good 24/7 accident/breakdown toll service to recommend?,btohqsg
the many bens of the same scammer having multiple accounts,btohqsg
Just an update Guys. If you're planning to go to JB. Yesterday at noon. It took only 25 minutes from S'pore customs to exit JB customs. It was a breeze. No checks done at Malaysian side at all. Luckily my car has a VEP with RFID linked to Touch n Go. So Just chopped passport and cleared to leave. Coming back was also very smooth..Also the same duration 25 mins too. Have A Safe Trip and Happy Holidays üëçüèΩ,btohqsg
Message/call. From this group. Should I pick up?,btohqsg
Maybe really a female lol ‚ï∞(‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù¬¥Íí≥`‚∏ù‚∏ù‚∏ù)‚ïØ,btohqsg
Whoa! That's delightful. I remember 5.30pm would have been peak period traffic jam pre-Covid. ‚ãã‚úø ‚Å∞ o ‚Å∞ ‚úø‚ãå,btohqsg
Why he keep messaging you ah?,btohqsg
It was a real easy to and fro drive. No stress  no dateline and most of all no pressure.üëçüèΩüòä,btohqsg
i received numerous unsolicited messages too asking me to add them if i want sugar mummies. i cant block these enough. this never ends. the many scams of Bens.,btohqsg
actually the borders reopening have dampened many who got now used to staying in singapore. they aint going back to jb and businesses there are not reporting rising sales.,btohqsg
"he said ""he doesn't understand"" - why i called him a thief. and he says he is STILL in this group. Well  i said good job of using another # to be in the group. This Ben is made of many.",btohqsg
he said you didnt remove him...,btohqsg
I think it takes time for all the shop to recover. YTD I came in for getaway to stay at princess cove. 90% Most of the shop closed,btohqsg
one way is to report to telegram to ban him here. at least that phone# telegram account is stopped,btohqsg
i go there lately. puteri cove residences. you own a unit there?,btohqsg
only shops like Kuu and coffee club are there plus a few small ones,btohqsg
Yes. No bro I have no $ haha Airbnb,btohqsg
how much did you pay there a night,btohqsg
the condo is the best among there in terms of furnishing. styled like MBS hotels. they copied exactly,btohqsg
Approx $73. Depends on who is the provider. Some good some so so. Definitely cheaper than hotel,btohqsg
most are not doing well. not far from here  youcan try out karting. rm55 10 mins,btohqsg
from puteri cove you can see singapore. so near,btohqsg
last week the sales person showed me their condos wanting to sell. it's launched at 1300 psf but now lower,btohqsg
Actually I have window shop before covid 19 lockdown. If u want to buy  I say just rent long term,btohqsg
yes renting is best option. so many choices,btohqsg
Much cheaper than u buy as work quality is bad. Worst is they do not maintain condos.,btohqsg
If u follow the FB post  lots of complain,btohqsg
puteri cove is okay. teega is also okay. the lesser ones are the bad ones. generally those cheaper condos are the ones badly maintained. avoid,btohqsg
