And somemore one guy one girl,btohqsg
Anybody still receiving tele job messages,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt matter what they say right?,btohqsg
"Literally asked the person ""how I know this not scam""",btohqsg
Anybody know how to check whether a company's website is legitimate?,btohqsg
HAHA  I mean their process is they'll expect you to WhatsApp them  then they'll add u into a grp chat with a bunch of strangers (some local most overseas) then send u the task and u do then they'll disappear forever,btohqsg
"no company uses Telegram PM to ""recruit"" staff",btohqsg
I got a job thru telegram tho but I pm them one,btohqsg
Ya. Its you pm them  not they pm u,btohqsg
and also when their description says nothing... Its a tell tale sign it's a scam,btohqsg
Some more no need resume or interview  seem sus enough,btohqsg
The person gave me the company's name,btohqsg
But the way they text is a bit off,btohqsg
"Like when the person mentioned "" we is from xx company""",btohqsg
I mean it's kind of obvious which are fake y once you start receiving like 5-10 of them a day,btohqsg
She told me to fuck off ü§£,btohqsg
Then she deleted and cleared chat,btohqsg
I just sent her a lag message,btohqsg
"or sometimes send them their ""company"" website",btohqsg
And go like... I contact supervisor now  I want more money job. Your job no good,btohqsg
Also if anybody is planning to work as waiter/waitresses after Os  please don't apply for the company named primarius,btohqsg
Lol I got those DMs as well,btohqsg
Had a bad experience  don't recommend cause ahem they expect you to work damn fast and carry lots of heavy ass plates,btohqsg
Not worth it for 9/1 10/1,btohqsg
I worked fnb few times and hated it LOL,btohqsg
During my experience  on the spot while working  there was an ongoing argument and shouting between the stupid senior waiter and a beginner at the back of the restaurant kitchen sooo yep  the person quitted on the spot too,btohqsg
There was ad hoc jobs(refill ice bucket serve complementary meals(bread busket) kinda burnt my fingers )   no clear instructions on what to do etc. Etc. During peak hours  it was just dead ass shitty. Its more of you adapt on the spot. Need to be  v vigilant,btohqsg
It's a legit company but nah just block em lol,btohqsg
I should have joined my friend and work in popular,btohqsg
But we kinda didn't contact after grad so I didn't know until I went to the shopping mall she was in,btohqsg
