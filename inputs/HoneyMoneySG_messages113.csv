For grocery  my Crmc almost hit 1k  what‚Äôs should the replacement card  if I use uob ppv and pay with FP app  will get 4mpd?,btohqsg
UOB evol increasing min spend to $800 for statement generated after 7 aug 24 :(,btohqsg
Please note that UOB EVOL card spending will be increased to $800 from Aug 2024.Refer to website for more information :https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/cashback/evol-card/index.pageRevised cashback cap : S$30 online & mobile contactless  S$20 overseas spend (in-store only). Minimum spend $800 per monthEVOL nerf incoming,btohqsg
$30 online and $30 contactless ?,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it 0.4mpd for revo if it‚Äôs excluded from mcc,btohqsg
"Not ""and"" that way I thinkIt's $30 capped cashback for online + contactlessAs opposed to the original $40 cap",btohqsg
Actually 800 is also quite a lot,btohqsg
"""Realistic"" effective cashback rate is 3.7% from Aug onwards. Nobody should and would use a cashback card for consistent overseas spending",btohqsg
Minimum spending for cash back card to get desire cash back %.. is the reason why I switch to miles/ reward card. If I need to spend 800. I rather use citi rewards or hsbc revolution.,btohqsg
Same logic for me. I certainly value a mile at more than 1 cent. My plan now is to thrift it out with these two cards for 1 year  and see what new to bank offers UOB got come 2025,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing your future reading  please provide us with more of your predictions,btohqsg
Your card should suit you   not you go out of your way to spend lol,btohqsg
Can I ask your wise opinion what if miles cards drops to 1mpd? Will you still continue to use miles card,btohqsg
Haha right after singsaver miles vs cashback campaign. Like a slap on the face.,btohqsg
I am glad to be in this group. Admin and chris allow the members to share info on savings. Unlike aaron side everyday on miles and hotel programme... now I more into miles...Although hsbc has nerd travel... but can still use dbs woman world card to replace it.Only problem is rewards points expire 1 year and amaze is chopped.,btohqsg
It would be a sad state of affairs for all rewards chasers if that happened. But since it hasn't we should all still make hay while the sun shines,btohqsg
But you also everyday share about miles and hotel programme,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why evol was never on their recommended list for cashback cards,btohqsg
That will unlikely to happen.Esp for hsbc revolution and citi rewards. The reason why I think may bank switch to blocks of 5 is they want to follow the way spore bank does it.,btohqsg
Don't have to say other group. Just mind our own business will do.And it's nerf  not nerd,btohqsg
The question is your opinion on what if. What would you do?,btohqsg
If that happens .. then I will see the clips of chris. I am sure he will share what are the cards to use next...,btohqsg
My opinion Is I will read up other blog to find alternatives,btohqsg
I have a feeling. The day will come max card or revoult will allow cards to earn reward to compete against amaze.,btohqsg
Then that‚Äôs not your opinion  it‚Äôs others opinion. What if all miles chasers move to cashback cards  will you cancel all your miles card and move to cashback?,btohqsg
I already say that is not going to be happen. Because of competition,btohqsg
Lads stop pressuring him with hypothetical situations that are unlikely to ever occur. Airlines and banks have partnered for way too long that they wouldn't allow them to screw up rewards programmes like that,btohqsg
You see why bro.. ocbc rewards.. they no longer have yearly big purchase benefits but they allow certain merchants to be use and customers able to gain 6 miles rewards.,btohqsg
What may happen is dbs woman may nerd the points to 1000 to 1100 monthly bonus cap to be on par with citi or hsbc,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not hypothetical if you look at the bigger picture. HSBC had like 2 nerfs/changes to their mcc whitelist in like less than a year. What makes you think other banks won‚Äôt follow suit in the future?I‚Äôm referring to things like miles card doesn‚Äôt reward bonus points on let‚Äôs say supermarket and your best other options is a cashback card. Will you stick to a miles card or a cashback card? Given that it‚Äôs your bulk of spending,btohqsg
1 thing about boc and icbc I don't understand is they don't have a strong rewards card to compete against citi rewards  dbs woman and uob rewards card.,btohqsg
I would stick to the card that gives the best value for each mcc and draft my credit card set-up accordingly. No need to stubbornly stick to either side. Go where the wind flows,btohqsg
But that‚Äôs you. I was asking his opinion since all he talk about is miles and hotel points,btohqsg
Conclusion is best opinion is don't have own opinion. No need ask liao ü§£,btohqsg
I think why hsbc nerfs on fast food is maybe they already check on their side. .. not many people use revolution to eat mac  bk or KFC....,btohqsg
Revolut keep nerfing already.. dont think they will bother about spending rewards.,btohqsg
But I don't understand is why nerfs agoda   klook.. . This is the 2 main spending I use them every year ever since 2021.,btohqsg
Then the more they should give you bonus points on those merchants? To attract others to use it there,btohqsg
That is bad.. revoult should continue to provide competition against other travel cards,btohqsg
Amaze  don't have competitors for rewards travelling,btohqsg
It's very different leh. Revolut  not revoult  began as an FX card  similar to YouTrip. They already give good exchange rates  how to afford to give rewards compatible to what banks give when banks are charging 3ish%.You set up a card that have close to spot rate and gives 4mpd? I will sign up.,btohqsg
Trust bank now requires minimum 5 transaction amount to be at least 30 dollars to be qualified for additional interest  is there better alternative for digital banks?,btohqsg
Yes they need to nerfs something then come out with some thing different to give a direction competition against amaze card,btohqsg
That card will close shop within 6 months lol,btohqsg
Thats why lo.. It's like when Citibank had the 8mpd unlimited spend.. I heard the Product Manager was asked to leave.#hearsayfrom citi friends,btohqsg
Revolut's business model doesn't work that way. Their target customers are debit using people such as students travelling for the first time or retired folks without income. Not every card user will penny pinch every single mile,btohqsg
Haha . But this make more people spends more too,btohqsg
0.o and the bank will spend more than it should to pay for the miles to people... banks need to make money. not lose money.,btohqsg
I think it is the opposite. A lot of people just charge hawker  food court  kfc  FP  Cold Storage n OTA transactions to the cards. Bank doesn‚Äôt get many 1x point(0.4 mile) transactions from other transactions. Hence  need to nerf 5411  5814  4722 and 7011.Bank designs the rewards structure of credit cards n hopefully some customers will charge 1x or 0.4 miles transaction to it.,btohqsg
To the bro. I think he referring to this.,btohqsg
Hi anyone participated in the Webull 8.4% May promo? Is it worth exchanging sgd to usd to enjoy the promo?,btohqsg
Correct. Most if not all card users in sg aren't in this  or any other financial related groups. They won't notice what card they are tapping on for and those are the people subsiding rewards for the rest of us,btohqsg
I think this also valid reason,btohqsg
No  actually i was referring to 2018 promo.,btohqsg
Bro can share more on 2018. Not similar to the pict I share,btohqsg
My human that withdrew on 1st June. Not taking part. I don‚Äôt want any uncertainty or argument on the 30 day thing.I have another human $1k since 2nd May. Using that human for July cycle if still decent.,btohqsg
Can any gurus here give any insights on this? Thanks so much !,btohqsg

"Here's my ""realistic"" calculation:30 (mobile and contactless) / 800 (minimum) = 0.0375Ignore overseas (better cards around for that) and others (that scummy 0.3% again)",btohqsg
Bros and sisters. What is your opinion on using amex card rather than a 4 miles rewards cards.,btohqsg
For miles? No point. Amex good for hooting the sign up bonus and then cancelling the next year. The earn rate so low some more.,btohqsg
Yes agree with you... but cancel already amex scan QR can't be use in hawker already?,btohqsg
Factor in the FX spread for conversion  see if the return% is up to your liking. 7% p.a. is still rather attractive. But note of the FX fluctuation risk,btohqsg
If that's your intention then sure lah  especially now XNAP is dead,btohqsg
I love how they say its (ENHANCED) but they know they will give less money back to the customer,btohqsg
Agree with the bro. Low point amex.. but I keep it for eat with family at hawker.,btohqsg
Amex they have their own strategy... despite not many people use their cards.. in spore. I rather surprise they can survive so long ... vs local banks or citi   hsbc,btohqsg
I used it ~ 8 times at Klook to save $240  and and 4x at Croissant shop to save about 30%.,btohqsg
Popo so stonk! What about steamboat?,btohqsg
Amex has brand name/ prestige going in its favour. The truly rich dont care how much % they are getting back from their spending,btohqsg
I think most in amex chat treats it like a game? lol.,btohqsg
What is your definitely of truly rich?I heard there are even those who don‚Äôt even pay with their own hands.,btohqsg
Yeah they are different kind of optimisers I feel. Maximising vouchers instead of air miles earned,btohqsg
"when my friend asked  ""dont everyone has an RM?  and oh  it's just Citigold...""",btohqsg
RIP EVOL  was the last standing amongst the trio of contactless cashback cards (Frank  Live Fresh  EVOL),btohqsg
HSBCSG (1/2): You've qualified for the HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme! From now until 31JUL2024  enjoy 1% Cashback on eligible debit card spends andFinally received!,btohqsg
Truly rich don‚Äôt even use cards‚Ä¶,btohqsg
$800 what's the zzzzzx  so what's next,btohqsg
Hmm ü§î 800 so means 400 contact less & 400 online? Nedd Chris to revise,btohqsg
Nah  the pooled and lower cashback cap is the killer,btohqsg
I dont park money with ocbc 360,btohqsg
Doesn't matter anymore since going forward online and mobilepay shares the same cashback cap of $30,btohqsg
WOW is combine Total $30 not $40 as before,btohqsg
Zzzz what the xx guessed Evol down the drains again like HSBC Revo,btohqsg
Hmm ü§î what's next to replace Sian 2 more month to enjoying the last Evol,btohqsg
Even worse than that lol. Online and contactless are now combined into one category capped at $30,btohqsg
The other two cashback categories are trash  plainly put,btohqsg
Killing it plus min 800 spend,btohqsg
I can still see a use case if they removed foreign transaction fees for this card  but otherwise it just doesn't make sense,btohqsg
Ya still can use for overseas loh if get 50 for 800 spend is 6.25 cashback,btohqsg
Incorrect if foreign transaction fees are still in place  which will eat into the overall % back. Hence why I mentioned they should waive said fees to make this card somewhat more marketable,btohqsg
u still get net gain lah  just need to keep the fcy spending at 200 sgd max,btohqsg
It means the nerfenhancedthe bank profit.,btohqsg
I will still bring it when i go traveling haha  but must physically insert into the terminal  or wave the card but must not use mobile contactless loh,btohqsg
Hi folks can I check. Is it hsbc revo card cannot use with Kris pay or fave ShopBack?,btohqsg
The nerf was very similar to ocbc frank to be honest  except that ocbc frank allow the foreign currency spend to be online which is easier,btohqsg
Some traditional methods still applied ..,btohqsg
Can use  but make sure the MCC still falls within the whitelist.,btohqsg
I use hsbc revolution link to Google.  It links to kris pay for my shop and eat,btohqsg
Maybe switch to ocbc card to earn More ocbc 360 int while use uob one to earn bonus int after nerf Evol,btohqsg
Quick question  the following are the high interest account/instruments that i know today? For banks  OCBC 365 - $100K @ 4.65%  UOB One - $150K @ 4%  Core Finance - 20K @ 4.2%. May i ask if there are any account/instrument that offers more than 4% interest?,btohqsg
HSBC egaCan do 4.X% for one month then move outCan do 4.X% every month if u control 2 accounts,btohqsg
Got it. For two players only.,btohqsg
okay  let me put it on 2nd Jul and see what will happen  anyway  thanks for sharing!,btohqsg
Challenging - Its needed $30K eligible TX on a monthly basis.,btohqsg
Must buy insurance and do monthly investment too. üëéüèªüëéüèª,btohqsg
To be honest dbs is full of cash from saver  they dont need to attract saver for cashflow. Look at the queue at posb/dbs atm,btohqsg
Hi Gurus.. I am new to the miles game.I haven't got any UOB cards but there seems to have quite a few useful cards for miles. Does anyone have any strategy or advice on which card should I sign up first to maximize the new UOB customer signup bonus?,btohqsg
Older generation like my father and mum.. they will prefer to use posb/dbs... I told them to use digital to set up online even hsbc EGA....,btohqsg
They rather go there queue. They say online worry get scam,btohqsg
I think should be the uob privi card  it usually have most promo for new sign up,btohqsg
Depends on individual... I have a mortgage under dbs (5yrs fixed 1.5%)  and I buy 100 rubbish shares at 0.001 so my cost is only 10c with zero commission. I do paylah for my lunch at food court  and sal trf to myself. So can easily clock highest tier w/o much cost/effort. üòâ As someone said  there's no bad product  just whether it is suitable or unsuitable to your lifystyle or situation.,btohqsg
The criteria are ok to fulfill. Just that 4.1% ain‚Äôt that exciting compared to the other HYSAs,btohqsg
If spend max S$200 in fcy  can get 6.2% cashback,btohqsg
After accounting the fcy fee maybe get back 40 plus cashback for 800 spend loh if get the 20 plus 30 cat  still a decent card,btohqsg
I am still earning uni$ for my priv visa card,btohqsg
Uob privi is in the link that Chris put in his article,btohqsg
Good dp  I copied what was in T&C of UOB Card  but can self-test,btohqsg
Ipaymy list still include uob privi visa and mc,btohqsg
For the 2mth EGA promo  if I am not going to top up funds in the second month  i will not get the bonus interest in the 2nd month  right? Then i need to move funds out of Ega after 1 mth?,btohqsg
Yup. But purely local spend is no go.,btohqsg
Hi alll. For HSBC EGA 1% Cashback now excludes payment to financial institutes. So does paying for cc bill via giro still eligible for the cashback?,btohqsg
I think someone confirmed it is still eligible,btohqsg
If can avoid magnetic stripe is best,btohqsg
Londonbridge not reliable  beware. Their terms not clear at all  just want attract bigger customer database but don't pay sign up bonus to all.I maintained $3000 in Fullerton cash fund for more than 30 days  never sell or withdraw it but I never get the $80 cash coupon.They want us to do buy trades but if u make profit from stock  sell the share then withdraw the profits from asset they refused to pay  treating it as transfer shares out to other platform even though total asset still above $3000.I argued over it to staffs Jay  Lucy  susie. They at first agreed to pay  say will get coupon in 2 days but in the end coupon never come  I chased again but now refused to pay.,btohqsg
I think even the Revo still eligible leh for 1% not sure,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. What do you eat at your shop?,btohqsg
UOB One account potentially 6% if combined with earmark promotion.,btohqsg
Now is the 30 day old fund question mark,btohqsg
Not that bad lah lol  still have 3 plus percent,btohqsg
ü§£ü§£ but increased spending to 800,btohqsg
A lot of these small fintechs. Be careful of them.I always look at who is the ultimate owner.,btohqsg
Yes. Need to see who is the one offering.,btohqsg
I google check. If it is approved by MAS.,btohqsg
Please DM me with your phone number or account number registered with LongBridge  I'll check with my contact,btohqsg
Hi hi can I check for Citibank credit card credit limit increase  must pay within how many days or just pay as usual on billing cycle?,btohqsg
Hmmm citi MRT can use mobile pay meh get cash back or must tap on physical card,btohqsg
cc credit limit changes don't change your statement dates so you'll need to pay within the same time frame as before,btohqsg
oh I see because I rmb I got charged late fee even tho I paid during my billing cycle hmmm,btohqsg
HAHAHA i see! did u have to spend $150 for 2 months straight in order to qualify for the reward? im thinking to sign up for the card!,btohqsg
Hi gurus! Does Citibank typically have promotion for new-to-*card* users?Because all of the current promos I see are for new-to-*bank* users!,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt rmb alr‚Ä¶ 5 years ago leh hahaha,btohqsg
Thanks Jasmine! Just wondering if Citi Premier has any past promo for new-to-*card*?,btohqsg
Haven‚Äôt seen one for past few years.,btohqsg
For buying 100 rubbish shares at 0.001  do we need to open DBS vickers?And no fee for the share puchase?,btohqsg
I guess I will eat the merchants,btohqsg

Does it mean we cannot use Diners card to pay for hawker food anymore?,btohqsg
If they have nets machine can still use nets ü§™,btohqsg
Unfortunately  we are taking one step backward to use cash again. It was mentioned that Xnap feedback that they are working to relaunch the app. Hope this is true,btohqsg
You mean use the Diners card physically to tap on the net machine?,btohqsg
Yes  with effect from 1st July,btohqsg
What will be the next alternative after 1st July?,btohqsg
No  slot into the nets machine and type your bank pin ü§£,btohqsg
Probably Amex pay is the only alternative after xnap and diners pay,btohqsg
Amex pay LoR Orr use kopitiam app,btohqsg
Yes  I been using xnap to help meet the UOB One 500 spending requirement üòÖ,btohqsg
Your Amex pay means the direct American Express company? Not those UOB Amex or DBS Amex?,btohqsg
Hawker centres dont have kopitiam app.,btohqsg
Haha I don't even think have nets. ü§™ Just use cash,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/202520Amex true cashback $150 offer  Extended till 30 Jun,btohqsg
Some places have PayLah/PayNow also not bad already. Personally I avoid cash only vendors.,btohqsg
I havent carried a single cent on me for past one year,btohqsg
Haha.. most hawkers and coffee shop is west side. They say paynow or cash,btohqsg
But comparing China cities with Singapore  their cities are really into cashless trend. Only use their apps wechat pay & alipay for all the daily needs.,btohqsg
Amex direct not those under uob,btohqsg
Yup. WeChat is literally their life app.,btohqsg
Ya no benefits using pay now haha unless just mean for cashless,btohqsg
We were close to this situation but iirc Singapore reject the idea,btohqsg
You know why.. because most hawkers don't want to pay charges to banks. So they want to cut cost,btohqsg
All want a piece of pie LoR defragmentation of cashless mode,btohqsg
Bro  the wechat and ali pay can go directly into their wallet  nothing to pay the bank,btohqsg
Too troublesome to log into Internet banking to pay for paynow. If paynow. I prefer pay cash .. .Pave wave/amexscan  shopback  ntuc apps can't be use . I pay cash .,btohqsg
Banks charge 0% for SGQR transactions.,btohqsg
More troublesome to carry a wallet,btohqsg
Provided the hawkers have these link l√†... they still prefer you paynow or cash...,btohqsg
Oh I didn‚Äôt know China have paynow,btohqsg
Hard for spore to follow china,btohqsg
We comparing China and Singapore on why they use wechat pay instead of cash  and you say coz they dowan to get charged by banks. How is this any relation to Singapore?,btohqsg
Bank charges 0% on SGQR transactions  you said they charge (???). And SGQR can support PayNow  Alipay  etc.,btohqsg
What I mean is spore hawkers and coffee shops sellers.. they doesn't want to pay charges to banks,btohqsg
I think more to do with income tax issue rather then bank charge since it is promotional 0 percent now,btohqsg
They want to earn all profit,btohqsg
Half the time he answer 1+1 with A,btohqsg
can use Ez-link mastercard scan to pay,btohqsg

@voidhighlordI don't think I have to explain to you twice,btohqsg
Any other benefits that I can‚Äôt get when applying online?,btohqsg
Nothing new bro... I feel they need to work a lot harder to make their cards more attractive again,btohqsg
Noted. I thought got something special that's why you share,btohqsg
It's a live location update. So you can maybe meet Terry IRL and see what he's like üòÇ,btohqsg
Can you explain why scb need to work harder? How is it not attractive?,btohqsg
Redemption rate to miles is poor .And also not relatively strong in their miles card.,btohqsg
He can help you plan out your cards to future proof it coz according to him  he knows which cards is going to get nerf,btohqsg
Oh yes I need his psychic powers üôèüèª,btohqsg
That doesn‚Äôt make it less attractive. Just coz a bank is not strong in miles doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it not as attractive to others. It‚Äôs like saying this chicken rice not nice because don‚Äôt have soup but other store got soup,btohqsg
Chicken rice need soup. No soup not nice. üò°,btohqsg
I wonder got Amex Ascend promotion orNot.,btohqsg
EZ-link app got QR scanner? Can enlighten me  how to get it pay?,btohqsg
Actually they have is the 3 miles selected categories bonus earn for scb journey card.. choices even less than hsbc revolution white list,btohqsg
But after 1st July  Diners won‚Äôt be accepted for SGQR payment anymore. But through Ez-link still can work?,btohqsg
yes  only diners will be removed cuz diners wants to remove their diners pay app,btohqsg
Perhaps you need a contingency plan - carry cash.Eg. Hp spoilt  hp stolen  battery flat  network down  etc‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Maybe you can look at a bigger picture and think from other perspectives  not everything is about miles,btohqsg
He need to redeem his trip to Vietnam...,btohqsg
The way DINERS announcd sounds like they are removing themselves from SGQR code system forever.,btohqsg
yeap  they dunwan to be the proxy anymore probably same for xnap i guess,btohqsg
I hope there is spontaneous escape coming for year end holiday,btohqsg
If that‚Äôs the case  having DINERS inside Ez-link app to scan for SGQR won‚Äôt work after 1st July?,btohqsg
wdym? ez-link mastercard is a wallet system similar to grab wallet. u can use credit card to top up to the wallet. anyway  can try using dcs app if u see any unionpay qr code.https://dcscc.com/dcs-cards-app#QR-payment,btohqsg
Which means the Hawker Centre needs to have this ‚ÄúEz-link ‚Äù logo display then can use?,btohqsg
yeap  u're right. most of the places that accepts credit card payments will usually have the logo anyway,btohqsg
Usually is they don't have. They prefer paynow .,btohqsg
yeah those are the stores that dun accept credit cards to begin with,btohqsg
Thinking of switching to ONE card soon but broadband and telco considered towards the spend to get CB ?,btohqsg
can use their simulator calculator to calculate the cashbackhttps://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/cashback/one-card-cashback-calculator.page,btohqsg
under recurring bill payments  u'll be able to find a list of merchants there,btohqsg
Must be recurring ? I mean if I pay monthly online for zym and StarHub broadband does it entitled cb ? Thx,btohqsg
payment mode dun matter  telco mcc eligible for cashback,btohqsg
Yes. but need to apply for early accesshttps://heymax.notion.site/Fly-Anywhere-with-heymax-ai-aff0d2e5912d433283dc31f8e9d274c1,btohqsg
Interesting. Just that the way to earn their max miles is limited. Almost all I didn't shop with.,btohqsg
Guys .. I going to delete heymax soon. I don't find them reliable,btohqsg
Go ahead and in future no need to announce here lah,btohqsg
One point people overlooked is that multiplier offers flat EIR from the first dollar. So it's great for putting in your last $x below 100k.,btohqsg
Treasures online equity trading account for no min comms trading. For cdp charges  because the transaction is so low valued  their fees were rounded down to zero. Lol. So total transaction is only 10c.,btohqsg
I found alternatives to heymax. Is use suitesmile.  What card to use for.,btohqsg
I gotten my slot at GXS !!!,btohqsg

Mainly it‚Äôs UOB and OCBC that likes to play with tier interest rates.Another thing is that unlike most banks  Multiplier bonus interest are daily accrued instead of based on MAB  which makes it less suitable for those with volatile cashflow.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGUOb evol actually is better for folks like you? Ie worth if go often to Malaysia and clock for the 10%?,btohqsg
It is not exactly 10 percent if u count the effective interest rate  most prob around 6 plus  i prefer maybank fnf over evol if go malaysia,btohqsg
small spend trust still best fx rates,btohqsg

I not after best exchange rate with card  am after the good cashback rate after all bank fee,btohqsg
same visa fx rate  just that uob have 3.25% fx fee,btohqsg
ya the fx fee is a zzz,btohqsg
That why u need a good cashback card to spend for foreign currency which still give u net gain after the bank fee,btohqsg
Agree. MBFF 8% for RM spend is the best. No fight,btohqsg
Let said if flight is 100 SGD  I will required to have 5556 max miles in my account?I thought I can claim if my account have no max miles yetIs it this 5556 max miles will be deduct from my account after claim to pay now?,btohqsg
Yes. Need to have 5556 max miles first,btohqsg
6.2% if clock $800 min spend and $50 cashback ($30 online+mobile  $20 overseas physical)  3.75% if only clock $800 min spend and $30 cashback.,btohqsg
I might be thinking this uob one account shd be given up. 800 min spend on evol card üôÑ,btohqsg
You still can clock with UOB One card 500 min spend  or with UOB Lady's card. If you use either card  UOB EVOL's changes will not affect you.,btohqsg
Can dbs woman earn miles from atome installation?,btohqsg
It makes u spend more basically to 800,btohqsg
Does it require to be of certain category? Any cap?,btohqsg
Hsbc should be up to 4.65% for registration made between 1 June - 15 June. Not 4.45%,btohqsg
After you factor in 3.25% fx fee for the $200  the cashback will be much lesser.,btohqsg
Did you see the date I sent the message? Editing of message is disabled after 2 days.,btohqsg
Got cap. RM spend is a category on its own. But if you spend at supermarket in Msia  it will clock the Grocery category first instead of RM category. You can read up MBFF tnc  the terms are clear.,btohqsg
Yup I saw 4 June.But the 4.65% promo started 1 June.,btohqsg
They updated the promo on 6 Jun. It was still 4.45% on 1 Jun.,btohqsg
Oh hsbc backdate the promo start date?,btohqsg
Hi  need some clarification. When spending with instarem amaze+crmc  is the 1% fee applicable to spending 1k (exact) or above 1k,btohqsg
Need some advices.About Evol new enhanced benefits  Not sure which part of my calculation is wrong on spending $800 per month.$500 => $50 CB on Online/Mobile/FX$200 => -$6.5 FX fee 3.25%$300 => $0.90 CB on Other CatCB % = ($50+$0.90-$6.5)/$800 x 100%= $44.40/$800 x 100%= 5.55%If only spend locally  it will be ($30+$1.5)/$800 x 100% = 3.94%,btohqsg
How about normal Installment? Do these earn miles as well?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  xnap is down. Cant install and cannot be found on app store. Website stated maintenance. What other apps u all use to pay SGQR (using credit card)?,btohqsg

Why Your Net Worth Supercharges after $100 000https://youtu.be/tQt6ZhCd4Sk,btohqsg
For large purchase and want to split bill   is there alternative CC for OCBC NXT/ SCB SMART ?,btohqsg
"The FX fee already counted as part of spend because they don't charge it as a separate transaction. You spend ""more"" on the product but it's part of the $800. But yes  you'll get lesser cashback if you minus the fees off the cashback received.We didn't include the other spend cashback also. Both your calculation is right if you do the above 2.",btohqsg
Xnap down very long alr. You can search through the chat to see all the past discussions.,btohqsg
i am looking at UOB Lazada card.. is it worth ah? üòÇ,btohqsg
got such card? I thought it's Citi that has the Lazada card.,btohqsg
1k is the cap for 4 mpd  not the min.,btohqsg
Are we getting CDC vouchers this month? Like no news of it,btohqsg
It is a new one lor.. I just saw while looking at UOB website. I see it is min spend 700‚Ä¶ slightly better than the new EVOL? Hahaha,btohqsg
It counts!!! That is why I consider lor. It not one account  I don‚Äôt use UOB alr üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Of course. Some people even open Lady's Savings account to clock extra 2 mpd,btohqsg
Lady card unless u got the higher tier one if not then category is limited,btohqsg
oh interesting  I didn't know. All along thought it's EVOL  ONE  and Lady's Card only,btohqsg
"But you spend enough on Lazada to make use of the cashback or not? Because the ""cashback"" is in the form of captive Lazada currency  have to spend on Lazada to make use.",btohqsg
So it‚Äôs 3.25%  not 3.5% markup? üòÖ,btohqsg
I also just saw it! Seems to be quite new.. but 15% for lazada spend is not bad.. just the cap a bit low..,btohqsg
Yeah you are right. I guess it only makes sense for ppl who shop on Lazada often.. hahaha.. let me go and do some more research first.. see if it makes sense.,btohqsg
I saw min spend is 700.. it is kind of better after this EVOL changes  before that  still EVOL better lor,btohqsg
Not sure if anyone shared  but I can confirm hsbc ega giro payments to financial institutions for insurance premium and car loan repayment still earn the 1% interest,btohqsg
Hi gurus  how do you transfer from one account to UOB one account as salary to qualify for the 6%?,btohqsg
If u got uob one and ocbc 360 u can try ocbc Any ooc,btohqsg
Stack both up which im planning to be since Evol nerf,btohqsg
Just do a fast transfer select salary from dbs appOr ocbc paynow on the webpage,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt do that. It could possibly nerf it permanently.,btohqsg
Huh why will it get nerf,btohqsg
Transfer from DBS  OCBC bank account via FAST to UOB One using salary purpose. And the interest is 4% EIR. Please read the tnc,btohqsg
Sigh.. I don‚Äôt know if should continue saving at UOB one  OCBC 360 or other places..,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I register for earmark uob sms today . Should I wait for next promo or just deposit before 29 June assuming I'm new to bank.,btohqsg
Then see which criteria fits you the most  uob need 500 spending  ocbc you can choose not to spend and just increase mab by 500On the balance of 20k  ocbc 360 is leading,btohqsg
I checked the OCBC calculator  about $6 more than UOB. If only credit+save. I do spend $500 on UOB one now. Actually my spending around 1k+/- monthly.,btohqsg
Then see if your spending works well with ocbc cards  then it‚Äôs a 3.85% iirc excluding your card rewardsBut I believe uob cards is better even if talking about uob one,btohqsg
I thinking my cashback return from UOB one card will be more than OCBC 365.. but the bank interest OCBC more than UOB. Headache haha. I don‚Äôt like UOB 500 1000 2000 spend also don‚Äôt like 365 merchant 5814 removed.. a big turn off. I thinking until headache liao.,btohqsg
Guys . I just check hsbc EGA account minimum balance is 2k . So is ok. Affordable to many of us. Don't need put a lot,btohqsg
U nedd do your own math's LoR,btohqsg
On balance of 20k  HSBC EGA and SCB eSaver account gives more than both UOB One account and OCBC 360 account.,btohqsg
2 more month for u to r&d,btohqsg
Thank you for reading the t&c for us,btohqsg
I thought only fresh fund? The balance average every month I think based on the increment..,btohqsg
If you rotate then it's fresh,btohqsg
Oh.. idea! Every month keep rotating between the 2 banks. Haha,btohqsg
Just wondering until how much savings than change strategy?,btohqsg
Is it still beneficial if you‚Äôre not doing a reset month or uob doesn‚Äôt have any ongoing promotion?,btohqsg
There‚Äôs other cards other than ocbc 365,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the point of putting in 2k only,btohqsg
I'm using 90N with card up to pay insurance and clock the 500 spend for OCBC 360. Then use Citi rewards with amaze for daily spend,btohqsg
Can consider ocbc infinity if you prefer cashback,btohqsg
If let's say if you undecided between uob and hsbc.. I feel can divide equally the sum between both banks.,btohqsg
Infinity card also can go with cardup? But the fees by cardup more than infinity cashback I think.,btohqsg
Not much cashback card can beat cardup fee,btohqsg
Worth meh use card up got extra % to pay insurance what's about town council and home electric bills and mobile bills,btohqsg
Yea this is my next card once I get my ocbc savings up. PROVIDED they don‚Äôt change and tnc to the savings account or the card,btohqsg
My insurance is just over 500 per month  the interest gained in 360 account can cover back the cardup fee,btohqsg
Plus I giro 90n bill to HSBC to get 1% cashback so still not bad,btohqsg
This giro bill method  the 1% is on your balance of hsbc ega or it‚Äôs 1% on the card bill? Do I need any balance in ega?,btohqsg
All above I use card up or citi pay all,btohqsg
Maybe can understand the interest mechanism for hsbc first before suggesting this,btohqsg
1% cashback on the card bill. Need to maintain at least 2k in HSBC EGA account  else will be charged fall below fee,btohqsg
At the start of the month I transfer 2k in  then do 5 txn. Leave only 2k + amt needed for giro deduction of credit card bills,btohqsg
100k/150K and able to meet the HYSA criteria,btohqsg
This 5 transaction can be either transfer in or transfer out?,btohqsg
Can do 5 FAST transfers out from EGA account or spend using HSBC debit card also can,btohqsg
Sry for the confusion. I'm not suggesting infinity for cardup but for day to day spending to hit 500 spend of OCBC 360 acc,btohqsg
Hi  need some clarification. When spending with instarem amaze+crmc  is the 1% fee applicable to spending 1k (exact) or above 1k,btohqsg
for cumulative domestic spending amounts on top and above 1k in calendar month,btohqsg
So spending of 1k exact no fee will be charge right,btohqsg
Cos I gng jus make 1 transaction of 1000,btohqsg
no fee if that is the only domestic transaction in the calendar month  unless mcc 4111 or 6540,btohqsg
Hi when does OCBC 360 account pays out interest?,btohqsg
Thanks to@ChrisHMSGfor helping me to bring to Longbridge attention. I just gotten the $80 sign up cash bonus now after another round of appeal.,btohqsg
7th working day of the month,btohqsg
So that means for this month it‚Äôll be 11th June?,btohqsg
most likely. not sure if saturday counts as their working day for interest credit,btohqsg

Hi I just apply for uob evol card. Last time I used uob one. Now  if I spend 300 on uob one  and 300 on uob evol  can I get the uob bonus interest? I credit 1600 too. Or do I need to hit 500 on either card?,btohqsg
Why u want to spilt the spending  u get no cashback for uob one like this and 0.3 cashback for evol like this,btohqsg
Cos uob one is good for shell petrol discount,btohqsg
Combine both spending to $500 will be entitled to uob saving interest,btohqsg
But spending below 500 on uob one card doesn't have the quarterly rebate,btohqsg
It is not about combine  it is about maximise the biggest benefit with cc and uob one acct combo,btohqsg
Then if I spend 300 each? I got no cash back?,btohqsg
Please see my reply i think clear enough,btohqsg
U have to hit the min spend   uob $500   Evo $600   Evo enhanced $800,btohqsg
I apply the uob evol cos I see 8 percent so I tot use it for all except petrol I use uob one‚Ä¶,btohqsg

may I ask on your recommendation what would be the best option in my situation?,btohqsg
Anyone ever gotten their uob account closed by uob? What are the chances for appeal?,btohqsg

6.67%* but from Aug it's 3.75%-3.9%.,btohqsg
4mpd for 1k in statement month  not calendar month,btohqsg
Depends on your goal. One factor you can think of is if your HYSA interest % is higher than your income tax % + SA/MA interest % combined.Put in CPF cannot come out  but you get to accumulate CPF faster with good rates and enjoy tax relief.Keep in HYSA you have liquidity.,btohqsg
I will still top up by end of the year to deduct income tax. just wanted to know whether any difference if I top up now vs I top up later in December?,btohqsg
so if I top up now directly  the cpf interest will start accumulating?,btohqsg
Top-up this month  it starts accumulating in Jul. Top-up in Dec  it starts accumulating in Jan.,btohqsg
Eg if apply in July 24. Card year mean July 24 - Jun 25 right?,btohqsg
Should be the issue month but best to check with cso,btohqsg

Hey guys  is citi smrt card spending on atome consider online spend?,btohqsg
Is it not possible to add more than one cards owned to Dobin  can‚Äôt see to find that option in the app,btohqsg

I think will continue with GrabPay ba,btohqsg
What benefits are there for grabpay,btohqsg
Being cashless is a benefit ü§£,btohqsg
GrabPay need top-up min $10 and gets stuck there if you don't spend at least $10 ü§™ but seems fine if you use often at hawker with GrabPay I guess.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs true  but I always use GrabPay for hawker so top up when needed haha. The balance there is always very minimal for example less than $10. I used it to pay education fees also. So I always get 1.3% cashback from it. 0.3% from UOB  and 1% from HSBC.,btohqsg
True but grabpay often has a lot of like orphan money inside  like the cents actually pile up,btohqsg
As long not for Grab rides or food will do,btohqsg
Actually if you seek help from their support  money can be transferred to your bank. I tried once successfully. That time I trying to pay insurance but failed  so my sum of money is stuck there. I contacted their support for help haha.,btohqsg
Purely for paynow QR scan payment. I know why you say that haha. Those rides and food can use card for better cashback.,btohqsg
That's why I don't like grab pay,btohqsg
GrabPay still allow me a 1.3% cashback for paynow payment. I can‚Äôt find any other since XNAP is down.. AMEX I don‚Äôt have though.,btohqsg
Not everyone as lucky as you. I see cases where people request for refund and they don't get it back after months.,btohqsg
I wonder Amex scan can pay for UEN? And still get cashback?,btohqsg
If you scrolled up and read  xGSx have explained how.,btohqsg
only for those sgqr going through nets gateway,btohqsg
I used to keep transferring to grab wallet when Google pay gives cashback just by topping up,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing your opinion. Appreciate it a lot,btohqsg
Bro. Don't use any top up. You won't get any miles.,btohqsg
I absolutely stopped using grab in general. Used to be first tester for grab debit and paylater. Since then the nerf is worse and worse. I understand they wanna promote their usage of wallet but üòì,btohqsg

Hi  I pay for airlines and hotel using standard cc. Now I see the statement is 200 more than I pay on that day. Anyone know what could be the reason? 50 more on air ticket and 150 more on hotel.,btohqsg
I tot the amount is locked in the day I pay.,btohqsg
Very vague. What platform? Local/fx spend? What card?,btohqsg
If charged in fx  locked on the day it's posted. If charged in local  locked on the day of transaction.,btohqsg
Booking.comfor hotel and ANA airline on their website,btohqsg
Like that 200 more.. too ridiculous,btohqsg
You only answered 1 of 3 qn lol,btohqsg
Boojing.comis charge in yen. Ana in sgd.,btohqsg
Anyone know why credit card amount is more for the hotel and airline booking,btohqsg
No info on what CC you're using.Booking.com: use posted date Visa/MC exchange rate (not Google) + 3.25% FX charge (see your card's t&c)ANA: maybe check your invoice receipt if they added the charges? Or see your card's t&c.,btohqsg
Wow.. how u guys book hotel and airline? Using what cc.. cos the fx is too much,btohqsg
"Maybe you can search the chat with ""hotel card"" and ""airline card""",btohqsg
std chart cc charge 3.5% fee for charge in foreign currency  1% for charge in sgd but processed overseas.,btohqsg
Uncertain.. Perhaps can use Amaz + uob lady,btohqsg
no fx fees but there is about 1.9% markup over mastercard conversion rate,btohqsg
Super high. Means I make a mistake using that card. U all use youtrip card for overseas hotel?,btohqsg
youtrip is like 8th down the list,btohqsg
What card u use? I really feel anger by the extra 200 charged. I need learn from mistake,btohqsg
I use more often on agoda due to bank offer rather thenbooking.com,btohqsg
What card is good to be used for Airbnb booking to avoid transaction fees?,btohqsg
Very strange is that the hotel I want book I can‚Äôt find on agoda. But oso got thr extra charges on cc? What card u usually use to book,btohqsg
no joke this one. really is everyday sia,btohqsg
Just came back from Japan  used GXS debit card for some transactions. The rewards are kind of not bad. Would say it‚Äôs better than YouTrip for now as they both use Mastercard foreign exchange rate.,btohqsg
Amex pay lor or use other card link to kopitam app,btohqsg
Hi bros. I go into hsbc webpage online. To apply for hsbc Ega account. They say you are ineligible to apply this account . I called up customer service They say as you are holding hsbc cards. U can't apply online. Need to go branch apply.. do you guys occur this issue,btohqsg
Yup same for me. Emailed in before and you have to go down to the branch to apply,btohqsg
Itd be better if GXS could be added to Ô£ø pay üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è,btohqsg
So troublesome .. uob when I apply uob ladys account no such issue. By the time when I go down to the branch next sat. Promotion bonus ended,btohqsg
Advice pls anyone  CPF life  as my mum is 70  cpf asked my mum to start redrawal which she means she will lose about 4% interest rate  any advise for this thanks,btohqsg
Hi all i plan to contribute cpf 8k parents 8k myself  for self contribution portion how much do you guys suggest to split vcma / rstu? im thinking 4k - 4k  thoughts?,btohqsg
GxS card cannot be added to any mobile wallets currently,btohqsg
Depend on bank promo at the time  currently ocbc/dbs/maybank is 18 percent off. Citi 20 percent off limited redemption,btohqsg
They give u cashbacj immediately? So they debit only the amount after cashbacj?,btohqsg
Why would she lose the 4 percent lol  she is already 70 shouldn't she enjoy her fruit of cpf,btohqsg
The full cost will be deducted from your main account. After this transaction  the reward will be instantly credited to your main account.,btohqsg
tbh  it really depends on what you're planning to achieve. For younger groups  i would rather top up my medisave to the max (for future cpf contributions to go into OA and SA) and for older generations  RSTU,btohqsg
The rewards seems good. The cashback. Did u count how many percent?,btohqsg
For 33 dollar u are getting 4.5 back.. that is incredible,btohqsg
It is random mean luck liao,btohqsg
firstly  why is this even a consideration?secondly  if she dont withdraw  when are you expecting her to withdraw?,btohqsg
Oh.. random.. no fix cashback.. anyone try the GXS debit? Better than youtrip? I going Japan year end. Must maximunise,btohqsg
Nope. It is a random reward. I believe the rewards are rather good now because they want more people to onboard their GXS bank. Just like previously  Grab gave out many points and vouchers a few years ago  which got nerfed badly.,btohqsg
I see‚Ä¶ the fx rate good?,btohqsg
They use Mastercard foreign exchange rate  same as YouTrip. The advantages over YouTrip are that you can withdraw your money from GXS to your bank via PayNow and you get a small interest of 2.38%p.a. which is credited daily. YouTrip cannot do withdrawal. I withdraw the leftover money back to my bank after my trip.,btohqsg
I only use YouTrip to top up my Suica card because YouTrip can be added to Apple wallet.,btohqsg
Youtrip gets spot or slightly better for yen.,btohqsg
In that case  is better off using GXS. And u dun need to exchange to yen in advance. And u have cashback. Youtrip no cashback right,btohqsg
I just watch chris on the 5% and the comparison uob stash account and hsbc ega.What you say is true basically you only get 3.05% on the first 100k .. hence. EGA Account much better..,btohqsg
You can use YouTrip to withdraw yen from 7-11 atms in Japan for free (Below $400SGD is free). GXS cannot withdraw yen.,btohqsg
So is GXS debit better than youtrip?,btohqsg
Just use YouTrip to withdraw yen because some places like shrines entry uses cash and GXS debit for card transaction.,btohqsg
I thought use revoult to withdrawl from oversea is better than all other travelling currency card. Withdrawl up to 350 outside spore is free,btohqsg
Noted. I go apply GXS debit.,btohqsg
Trust uses Visa rates. I'm not sure if it is better than Mastercard rates but it can be an extra option for cash withdrawal.,btohqsg
That is correct. If you searched before asking you would have found your answer.,btohqsg
depends on currency as well. for yen  visa is slightly worse,btohqsg
I found.. but cannot do it online,btohqsg
She's already 70  she don't withdraw now then when??? The 4% interest also don't go to her lol.,btohqsg
Congratulations you found your answer  then why still ask?,btohqsg
I not ask . I just share the info,btohqsg
how high the interest doesnt matter if you cant spend it,btohqsg
this doesnt seem like sharing information,btohqsg
"Now SA closes at 55  ""reserved amounts"" don't matter anymore. Depending if you want more tax relief opportunities or build up your CPF numbers faster.RSTU for more tax relief opportunitiesVCMA for faster CPF numbersRemember policy may change anytime  today is like that  next year maybe not",btohqsg
If not how you guys earn money and save,btohqsg
Saving at 70 years old? Then why you spend money and get miles? Should not spend anything,btohqsg
should consider saving face first tho,btohqsg
Bro. I mean save is for hsbc . Ega account ..,btohqsg
Bro  we talking about cpf you talk about ega?,btohqsg
It's a lucky draw concept. You spend at least S$10 or fx equivalent  they give you 1 scratch card. You can get 1 cent every time if you unlucky. Just like Gpay.,btohqsg
anyway i believe you can only drag cpf life withdrawal age till max 70  so no advice is needed. you cannot say no,btohqsg
Youtrip no have. This one at least got so I would think is better?,btohqsg
The faster you build up your CPF  the lesser your tax relief opportunities are. Not no tax relief.,btohqsg
Haha now he has resorted to liking his own messages,btohqsg
I say I like reading chris clip,btohqsg
Depends. YouTrip can lock the price by converting to yen and storing in the wallet. You get to withdraw up to S$400 fx equivalent from overseas ATM without fees as well. Basically what others have already told you.Top-up YouTrip can get cashback  if you know how.,btohqsg
What chris say is true. Basically uob stash is only 3.05.. if there is better saving account.. why not go for it,btohqsg
yes... if is not true he wont say it unlike others who dont fact check,btohqsg
I feel youtrip will come in handy for situations where you need cash  then gxs can act as your normal spending cards for places that accepts card payments,btohqsg
Bro Melvyn.Should I continue to use revoult card to withdrawl my $$ oversea ATM in vietnam,btohqsg
No  should save this money in hsbc,btohqsg
Why not use your favourite card to earn your favourite miles? Or is it your Viet gf ask you for cash?,btohqsg
I help you count. His cashback rates are 1.25%  13.4% and 7.14%,btohqsg
Lol  since it is random so it is like lucky draw loh  max is 5 dollar right,btohqsg
That's right haha. Even at maximum of $5 cashback  it ranges from 50% to even as low as 0.0001% cashback.,btohqsg
The alog should be like a pyramid whereby 50 percent is at tip and 0.001 percent is the highest lol,btohqsg
Hahaha. If they pay $5000 and get $5 maximum cashback  it's already 0.1%. Imagine getting $0.01 minimum cashback on $5000. That's 0.0002% cashback.,btohqsg
Maybe only useful for small amt between 10 to 50 in foreign currency but i still prefer known benefit over lucky draw since i know i seldom have luck de.,btohqsg
Haha only optimised at $10 purchases. Minimum of 0.1% cashback or maximum 50% cashback.,btohqsg
My fav card is now amaze.,btohqsg
She ask me to bring her eat korea bbq,btohqsg
Korea use Korean won not Viet dong. Korean BBQ shop in Vietnam cannot pay with card?,btohqsg
He like to tell everyone his preference sia lol,btohqsg
Yes maybe need take down notes for his autobiography,btohqsg
Once she reach 70 they will force her to withdraw it. Yes I agree but I think she still dun need to touch this money yet  it is also not a lot like other people have.,btohqsg
U dont think and what gov does does not match so think/look for alternative.Dont know what is your defination of not alot is. My dad is 74 this year  he also dont need the money from RA but just take it loh. I just max it out for him to stay at 60k for his RAU can always wait for cpf to payout monthly then u top up her RA monthly loh if she dont really need the money,btohqsg
Then what advice do you even need? So when are you planning to even withdraw this money? She‚Äôs alrd 70  not much financial instruments will fit herHonestly the 4% she gets wont even be used by her in the near future  since you say she doesn‚Äôt need the money.,btohqsg
Then take the money and deposit elsewhere if you *think* she does not need the money.,btohqsg
Can.. she say her friends boyfriend use revoult withdrawl from their ATM vietnam. Up to sing 300. No charges. Better than withdrawl from vietnam bank,btohqsg
Then what do you think? Earning your favourite miles or withdraw money without charges more beneficial?,btohqsg
He not thinking type  he is gf say what he do what type. U are asking too much of him by asking what he think liao,btohqsg
Maybe waiting for ML to tell him what to do,btohqsg
I want to listen to your opinion bro.. since some bros also chat on youtrip  and trust card to travel,btohqsg
My opinion is you should ask your gf to pay and earn her miles with her local bank CC  so you can save your money in HSBC EGA for 4.65% p.a. interest. Not UOB Stash account.She can use her miles earned to redeem ticket to fly back SG so you can pay for Korean BBQ in SG with your miles card. Next time you can fly back to Vietnam with your redeemed miles. The interest you earned from HSBC EGA at 4.65% p.a. can use to pay for the extra charges.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone try use heymax booking agoda hotel? Very new to this heymax  is it save?,btohqsg
Actually  not a bad option tho,btohqsg
Of course. If ppl got local card there  why spend on your card?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if you pay for Shopee Paylater using CRMC  will you get the full 4MPD?Or will linking amaze card help?,btohqsg
Yes they still direct you to the website to book if I rmb correctly,btohqsg
U want to try bank landing page instead for direct discount instead of heymax point?,btohqsg
Depend on shopee pay later mcc,btohqsg
As the 5th person asking this  maybe you can try and tell us?,btohqsg
I believe the MCC is 5999. It is for shopee  not shopback,btohqsg
Anyway same gist lah. Any pay later all need to see the mcc,btohqsg
The girl want you pay for the meal at restaurant...,btohqsg
Not all girl ok  is your girl only lah,btohqsg
My bad  new here. And I assumed you/someone in the community has tried. Didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs uncharted territory.,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs just yours. Mine is willing to pay when I visit her or split the bills,btohqsg
The vietnam girl say ok... but preference is as a gentlemen.  She say you should pay for all meals she with you..,btohqsg
You can try using empty amaze wallet to find out the actual MCC and check it against CRMC t&c. Most claim 5999 if you want can just try and tell us. Any data points are appreciated.,btohqsg
Then how in the world is she ok with u not paying or spilting the shares lol. She expect u to pay all,btohqsg
Got consider she only want your money or your miles?,btohqsg
Actually she also using hsbc in vietnam. She encourage me open hsbc account. That's why she told me better to use EGA.. as spore here more interest.,btohqsg
But I tot you got wife already? Got wife and gf ah,btohqsg
Very surprised meh  alot of married man have gf outside  just whether kena exposed or not.,btohqsg
Sadly HSBC EGA don't have Viet dong leh.,btohqsg
Encourage to open same bank so money reach other country faster for foreign exchange and lower fee,btohqsg
Which unit trust to buy for the additional interest for uob one?,btohqsg
No investment criteria for uob one  only dbs/ocbc have investment component for extra interest,btohqsg
Did you check UOB One account website before asking?,btohqsg
But HSBC personal current account in Vietnam support SGD. Maybe you can transfer money to her in SGD instead like a gentleman. SGD is a strong currency üëçüèª,btohqsg
Yup hold sgd rather then viet dong is a wise choice haha  but gf got to find from viet coz 'cheaper' to maintain,btohqsg
She ask me why use amaze card. As it don't have dong currency.. keep tell me use revoult withdrawl in hsbc vietna,btohqsg
Yes don't have. That's why she tell me don't use. Tell me use revoult,btohqsg
Revolut don't have but revoult have üëÄ maybe is some secret wallet we don't know de.,btohqsg
Are u dreaming? I ask revolut got keep dong meh.,btohqsg
What is revoult ah? Anyone know?,btohqsg
New app to keep dong only,btohqsg
Have to ask Terry Wong. Unfortunately I have no access to revoult.,btohqsg
It's a conspiracy. She's definitely team cashback so trying to prevent you to get your miles. You might want to reconsider her.,btohqsg
Maybe wise might have dong  but from what i know other wallet dont keep dong so really dont know what your gf is telling u.,btohqsg
He cant reconsider lah  gf got the upper hand.,btohqsg
Her arm longer so she can reach higher?,btohqsg
She keep tell me revolut card atm withdrawl up to sgd 350 is free. No charges,btohqsg
Everything he write is gf say this and say that mah,btohqsg
Sgd 350 enough? Have to spend for all her meals and her shopping,btohqsg
just realized amaze card cannot link to visa card.... mastercard is the only way? or any workarounds?,btohqsg
Vietnam alot of place take cash only haha.,btohqsg
The gf must never find out YouTrip can withdraw S$400 without charges. The S$50 need to stay in HSBC EGA to earn 4.65% p.a. Not UOB Stash account.,btohqsg
If gf find out mean 350 plus 400 more cash for allowance liao,btohqsg
Oh ya. $750 not just $400. Even $150k in UOB One account at 4% p.a. also not enough to cover. Need to put into HSBC EGA for 4.65% p.a. Not UOB Stash account!,btohqsg
Still *cheap* to maintain  next time got kids can raise in vietnam also. Cheap cheap,btohqsg
$750 per month not cheap liao. Some people cannot afford,btohqsg
My dad still give my mum a full time housewife allowance of 1 plus k so 750 for gf ok lah  somemore is young gf,btohqsg
Wife ok la. Gf can run anytime legally,btohqsg
Anyone knows if I can use Mastercard‚Äôs exchange rate to gauge how much amaze will charge me for an online transaction made in foreign currency? I saw from previous post that there is like a 1.9 to 2.2% markup?,btohqsg
U just add ard 2 percent to the day rate loh,btohqsg
So 2% on top of Mastercard rate right? Means still better than citi 3.25% if I check out with citi rewards directly and amaze don‚Äôt charge foreign currency transaction fee.,btohqsg
Wife can run also plus demand maintainence if divorce haha.,btohqsg
That's right. You still earn card rewards if eligible.,btohqsg
She knows about youtrip too 400. But still prefer me use revolut when in vietnam,btohqsg
50$.. not much difference. She know that in vietnam hsbc have rewards card called Classic. Name sound better than revolution,btohqsg
Then good ma  so he can say only can withdraw 350 without charges. Want more also don‚Äôt have,btohqsg
You too slow le.. she already knows both,btohqsg
Gg  no wonder no money save in ega,btohqsg
Then ask her to use her hsbc rewards card to spend in Vietnam,btohqsg
Damn what a great idea  maybe I should use cards based on the name of the card. Like Platinum card sounds better than what SMRT card. Rewards card also not nice  not as nice as Black card.,btohqsg
1 question she ask me . I can't answer.  She say now hsbc also have 1 travel card already. Can transfer my point to her account. She want to transfer to vietnam air.... lol,btohqsg
Samsam is right  she wants your miles.,btohqsg
banks also allow funds transfer  she got ask you transfer all your money to her also?,btohqsg
I'm a miles chaser  so meaning is very safe to book through heymax via agoda?,btohqsg
Why need to transfer to her? Can‚Äôt she earn the miles herself and fly what she want?,btohqsg
She is suggesting... I need to be careful..,btohqsg
maybe she is in this chat. she thinking: seeing what he type  this one sure can makan,btohqsg
You confirm told her about all the miles and money you have that‚Äôs why she suggest,btohqsg
No.. I told her now hsbc cards spore  points can transfer to vietnam air. Means I not necessarily need to take SQ,btohqsg
Ya loh  why you need to share this with her?,btohqsg
She ask me when coming vietnam,btohqsg
cannot transfer miles to others lah,btohqsg
Actually is also good. Hsbc now got more air partners...,btohqsg
That doesn‚Äôt answer the question. Why need to tell her hsbc can transfer to which partner. You just tell her the date can liao what,btohqsg
Can I use air tickets to qualify for minimum spending of OCBC 360 of 500?,btohqsg
need to flex that he using the right card with many transfer partners!!!!üëçüëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
does anyone experiencing HSBC Revo points not giving out neither 1X nor 9X from last month?,btohqsg
No. What did you pay and whenAnd the new app can see which transactions gives you 1 point,btohqsg
ok I shall contact CS to clarify for the very low points given.,btohqsg
i spent 600 on food  only 60 points given,btohqsg
Have you met her in person?,btohqsg
Could it be because the system upgrade for pooling? That‚Äôs why the points will come in later?,btohqsg
Y sound like those scam adv? Anyway if only few hundreds per month can make you 'happy' then ok lar. But don't gong gong give everything lar  if not even meeting.,btohqsg
For Snack  does anyone face card was declined error when topping up using credit card? Is there a limit to top up snack?,btohqsg

Hi  I'm new to the miles game and have a renovation coming up  costing around $30k in three phases. I'm planning to sign up for the UOB PRVI Miles Card to pay for the renovation via CardUp and take advantage of the sign-up promo. Will the renovation payments be eligible for the 1.4 miles per dollar of local spend? I couldn't find the category for local spend. Alternatively  is there a better miles card for this purpose?Thanks in advanceüôèüôè,btohqsg
Anyone know OCBC 360 how to do the interest tracker like UOB?,btohqsg
Search chat history ‚ÄúOcbc 360 tips‚Äù,btohqsg
What does miles chaser got to do with using bank landing page  u dont know certain bank landing give u up to 6mpd for agoda booking?,btohqsg
Yes u will get the 1.4 mpd thru cardup for your renovation. Just need to check for new sign up promo is cardup counted.,btohqsg
I've uob lady card (travel category choose)  sorry I don't understand what is the bank landing page?,btohqsg
Book through heymax agoda can stack up on top 6mpd  but I wonder save to use book from heymax?,btohqsg
Heymax have other travel partner that u will sure u will accummulate enough to redeem flight? There is no krisflyer partner with heymax.,btohqsg
Hi guys. If i were to apply citi bank rewards card through singsaver for the dyson hair drier  do i still entitled for the 16k bonus miles from citibank,btohqsg
Before u jump into any program  u might want to see if the program work with airline u want to fly on first,btohqsg
Do you mean safe instead of save?,btohqsg
Safe to book through heymax agoda?,btohqsg
It is safe but have u check out heymax miles partner  minimum to transfer out  how long it take to credit and how long the miles last etc.Since mastercard is giving 12 percent discount  u are opting 4 heymax point for over 12 percent discount if your hotel is eligible so this is the opportunity cost i am talking about.,btohqsg
Yes it‚Äôs safe. But will the max miles earned be useful for you? Are you planning to redeem flights from FFPs other than Krisflyer?,btohqsg
Am I correct to get max point from heymax and uob lady card get the uni$ for booking agoda?,btohqsg
Does anyone knows about this üòÖ,btohqsg
Have u read the tnc for the promo  sometime can stack  sometime cant  each sign up promo is different,btohqsg
Ohhh i see  havent yet. I dont really know the procedure of applying using singsaver. Is it like writting a form  then apply the card normally with citibank? Or is it like they apply on ur behalve? Sry if my qns very simple qns,btohqsg
After checking 12% master card promo and heymax still cheaper by $1 + heymax point,btohqsg
Maybe coz i am vip for agoda and i use card like dbs wwmc (18 percent) instead of just mastercard (12 percent) so i usually see much better rate then my friend see coz i spilt booking due to promo cap,btohqsg
If u put multiple night together it might not be economical viable due to promo cap  what i do is i spilt day to maximise the discount. I searching on heymax and agoda mastercard page now and it end up cheaper for hotel for 1 night for same hotel/same date/same type,btohqsg
Not leh. I think got hsbc branch at Vietnam. I recently just open a hsbc account in vietnam. Although still in the mid of opening.Just that their money can only be transfer from sg hsbc to Vietnam hsbc. And money cannot be transferred back. Only one way. So only consumption purpose can be used. And very troublesome from what I know. Cannot even get their debit card. Only atm card are given.,btohqsg
Did try split day vs multiple night  for me I don't see cheaper. I guess maybe u are vip agoda that's why cheaper,btohqsg
I thought their debit card is same as ATM. Is bad .. cannot transfer back from hsbc vietnam to spore..,btohqsg
Asking for a friend any cards to recommend for dining now? Prefer cashback/rewards pts and low / none min spend monthly  is HSBC revolution still good for this purpose?,btohqsg
Citi crmc with amaze  uob ppv  hsbc revo all not minimum spending  just that hsbc and citi award in 1 dollar spending block while uob award in 5 dollar spending block  plenty of low cashback card at 1.6 so u just research your own,btohqsg
In my opinion. Hsbc is the best for dining restaurant.  Such as din tai feng  crystal jade  paradise restaurants  hai di lao. Imperials,btohqsg
Ok thanks i thinking of HSBC for my friend  low requirement  online offline also can except fast food,btohqsg
Fast food. Better to use citi rewards with amaze card,btohqsg
That what I heard from the RM. So not too sure 100%. Still in the mid of opening. Going next week to get the account successfully open.,btohqsg
One more. If you are seafood lover like jumbo restaurants or dancing crab... also using hsbc revolution.,btohqsg
Hi all  I have a question on UOB One Credit Card. For example  if I spend $500 (including insurance premiums)  am I still entitled for the 3.33% cash back?$500 minimum spend-$250 for insurance premium-$250 for retail spendingDo I still qualify 3.33% on my $250 worth of retail spending?,btohqsg
Bro. Wish you good luck in opening vietnam hsbc  hope you success,btohqsg
"Kind of different. At least I cannot use it online example grab or what. Only can use their internal Vietnam ""paynow"" etc for some vendor",btohqsg
Just realised agoda got different tier for vip  I'm only bronze tier and my friend is platinum  he gotta better deal then me. Same hotel same date,btohqsg
They don't have HSBC EGA. They have HSBC current account with SGD support.,btohqsg
Yes i told u haha   i save about 200 plus for 10 night using bank landing page and vip compare to my friend so i told her to let me book,btohqsg
I am value chaser  not miles chaser,btohqsg
I mean account. Not really sure is it ega account or not. Or any other benefit. I also won't be keeping much money in vietnam. Just for consumption purpose. And possible to open a Vietnam stock trading account. If in the future  prepare to invest at there.,btohqsg
I read wrong. But right now HSBC EGA don't support Viet dong. Next time maybe. ü§™,btohqsg
I mean their Vietnam hsbc. Of course will be denominated in vietnam dong. If sg hsbc no then.,btohqsg
Wonder why can't uob create their own right.. benefit all uob card users,btohqsg
HSBC EGA  register for the bonus interest promo and fulfill Everyday+ reward criteria to get 4.65% p.a.Can register this by 15 Jun and then deposit on 1 Jul.,btohqsg

Some slow food restaurants have fast food MCC. Don't end up use HSBC Revolution and then no bonus points lo.,btohqsg

I also keep getting rejected in the past.Then I was told I never update my address in their system  I was like ‚Äúhuh? Isn‚Äôt my home loan with UOB?‚Äù.After I update my address  everything swee swee.,btohqsg
Do you have an existing UOB Lady's card?,btohqsg
Anyone tried before booking tickets from SQ websites for a family of 4pax but charged using 2 credit cards instead inorder to maximize credit card benefits?,btohqsg
Have you ever terminated credit cards last few years? Are you a foreigner? you income $150k all are fixed salary?,btohqsg
U can spilt 2 2 I guess,btohqsg
You mean buy first two tickets first and then pay and the follow by buying the final two tickets?,btohqsg
Yup  if u want to maximise cc benefit,btohqsg
I‚Äôm worried after buying the 1st two tickets  the air tickets will increase for the final two tickets,btohqsg
U can always try 2 browser  book 2/2 ticket concurrently on 2 sia acct,btohqsg
Hi guys and Melvin  please correct me if I interpret the table wrongly but even at 103k  we would still be able to have like 3.9% interest per annum which doesn't seem that bad to me,btohqsg
Sorry I don't get where you get 3.9% from,btohqsg
Where is this magical number from? I don‚Äôt see a single 3.9%,btohqsg
I just did this with my wife ytd. Use 2 browser and cfm at the same time,btohqsg
Haha I input 103000 in the ocbc website and got like interest of 344.08 for 31 days. My bad is 3.9xxxx. I took 344.08/31*365 to get the annual interest. OK something I miss out might be we can't be having 103k for the whole year.,btohqsg
Using two browsers with two different krisflyer accounts?,btohqsg
I still don't get where you get 3.9% from. Maybe provide a screenshot?,btohqsg
The price still remains the same? No increase in pricing?,btohqsg
Nope. I did page by page together,btohqsg
Sq work like this  they have a certain amt for sales at the cheaper pricing then move next tier then move next tier  so as long as your 4 ticket still available in the cheapest class (not economy/eco pre/biz when i mean class but those like y/n/certain coding for different tier). U get that price,btohqsg
I think I know what he saying. He only selected salary and save in the website and tried to compare to your excel which obviously doesn‚Äôt tally,btohqsg
Interest for months with 31 days,btohqsg
hi all  i‚Äôm new to cardup  can i just check if i key in the new user promo (to get $30 off)  can i still use the recurring insurance promo? if yes  where do i key the promo?,btohqsg
No   only 1 code at a time,btohqsg
Oh because I only able to spend on uob one so I can't spend 500 for ocbc. I see. Thank you for explaining.,btohqsg
ohh.. so i should do a one time payment first then subsequent i use the recurring insurance one?,btohqsg
ic okok! thanks so much for the reply everyone. üôèüèº,btohqsg
Then you could probably rotate 100k between OCBC 360 account and HSBC EGA. Without spend you will never beat HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
bonus interest is on 100k not 103k,btohqsg
Yup I understand actually the 3k earns me $1 interest haha,btohqsg
I am kind of noob with HSBC ega actually. Probably need to look for the video again.,btohqsg
Or it could earn $7 per month on Maribank at 2.88% p.a.  compared to 10 cents.,btohqsg
But also hard to predict when SQ moving to the next tier if only using one Krisflyer account to buy 2 tickets each time. By the time  I buy the final 2 tickets  the price might increase.,btohqsg
hsbc ega bonus is promo right not perpetual?,btohqsg
Yes so far they have been releasing every month but with different rates.,btohqsg
That why use 2 broswer 2 acct side by side  it is lock in i think when u click to the page of passenger detail for a certain timing,btohqsg
u can try 2 browser login to same SQ account,btohqsg
I have tried for booking 7 ticket on xiamen air when max is 6 ticket per booking,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs say we buy 2x2  but only 3 seat have lower price  so when both submit at almost the same time  will the price still stay the same?,btohqsg
Hi all  I have a question on Syfe platform and I'm new to investing. Before investing a large amount  I want to know about the money withdrawal process in Syfe.So  I transferred a small amount to Syfe (like 10 sgd)  bought US stocks and then sold them later. However  when I tried to withdraw the balance  I can't convert my USD balance to SGD and even withdraw anything to bank account.Can I know is there a limit imposed by Syfe when withdrawing money?,btohqsg
You need to convert before withdrawing,btohqsg
Let me try try that. Thanks.,btohqsg
Either you need to convert or there‚Äôs an option for you to select from which currency you want to withdraw,btohqsg
Guys for local hotel spending  whats the next best card? I realized i don't have a good card for local  physical spending.My current lineup is amaze+crcm  dbs wwmc and dbs altitude (i always use this thinking its 2.2mpd)No UOB pls. I boycott as my right üòí,btohqsg
Normally with these promos  do we still get to earn bonus miles e.g. with Citi x Agoda using Citi PremierMiles?Also  these promo can be found on the bank's pages?,btohqsg
Citi SMRT card  supplementary costs $90+. Anyone got waiver for supplementary before?,btohqsg
When u do search for 4 the price show should mean the available seat for the cheapest one available in system right now  so changing to 2/2 should not have alot of difference if do at same time as u check for 4,btohqsg
U can only choose either discount or 6mpd as it is 2 different landing page. No stack benefit,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc if book online as crmc exclude travel spend (which hotel fall under),btohqsg
I mean can recommend other cards too. Not limited to what i have,btohqsg
Anyone can recommend any other platform for house rentals? Seeking tenants,btohqsg
U say no uob ah but infact uob have some of the few best card,btohqsg
Maybe he‚Äôs another one that got his account suspended hence the boycott,btohqsg
Not really. I boycott uob cuz they kept rejecting my cc application hahahha! And i refuse to make an acc with them.,btohqsg
Which card you apply for . They reject,btohqsg
When was the last time you hold uob credit card? Did you terminate it?,btohqsg
"Have you tried searching ""reset month""?",btohqsg
I think the bank boycott u instead ü•¥,btohqsg
For UOB KF  will you still earn 3 MPD if booking non SIA group (SIA & Scoot) flights such as China Airlines or Air Asia through whitelisted online travel sites like agoda?,btohqsg
I think so too! Hhahahaha never had any acc or cc with them. Again last time i checked they asked me to go to branch but nowadays who has time,btohqsg
I would say its worth the time for the suite of cards they provide,btohqsg
Haha . You can go on sat,btohqsg
Okay guys  u convinced me. I'll reconsider.,btohqsg
Make people clock more and unable to pay,btohqsg
Business perspective wise doesn‚Äôt really benefit them. They already have enough user base that they don‚Äôt need to invest into making something that was alrd there,btohqsg
Is UOB Evol currently down? Im unable to make payment via shopee app,btohqsg
When you tried to convert  could you see how much USD you had available to convert and if it reflected the correct amount gained from your sold stock?I think i might have a similar issue as you but on tiger. I also sold a US stock recently and wanted to withdraw. Needed to convert from USD to SGD but found that the amount of cash gained from the sold stock was not available even though it was reflected on my portfolio cash balance amount. Read somewhere cos' it is still considered unsettled cash which will need 1-2 working days? Anyone else knows if I'm right? Feel free to correct me on this thanks!,btohqsg

What credit card is good for lump sum payment for eduation institute (mcc 8299),btohqsg
Hi can I check if OCBC 360 is the best current deposit account now? With 4.60% when just salary crediting  incremental balance and credit card spending,btohqsg
Which is the recommended credit card to use along with OCBC 360 account?Preference will be rewards applicable for most daily usage spending and low minimum spending requirements.Open to both miles and cashback,btohqsg
Great  thank you! OCBC rewards card is now very restrictive right? Given that not many MCCs are supported,btohqsg
I did videos on this  can compare herehttps://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ocbc+honeymoney,btohqsg
It changes merchants quarterly  it‚Äôs more like you won‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the next change implemented and you‚Äôll have to change your spending habits to suit it,btohqsg
Thank you both! Any recommendation of high interest savings account that is comparable to OCBC 360? I did some research and OCBC 360 seems like the best currently.,btohqsg
You need to do your own research and comparison  then check which one is best suite you. Different people different profile.Eg. Those without salary or income less than $1600  OCBC is not the best. Those who can‚Äôt save $500 every month  OCBC360 may be not in their favourite list.,btohqsg
Without salary can just self transfer  similar to UOB,btohqsg
