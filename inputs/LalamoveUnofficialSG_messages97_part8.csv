So I just leave the apps just like that uh,btohqsg

Don't waste time entertain such customers,btohqsg
I usually call and ask what item if I take car job.. if one person cannot take den tell Cs lor,btohqsg
But we need to always agree that customer is always cheapo.. so unless necessary.. don't take job that don't belong to your cat so nobody spoilt the customer la,btohqsg
Necessary means maybe last job to finish mission or you are heading that direction so you take to cover gas,btohqsg

I realized some shopping centre don't have grace period.. very rugi for car drivers to pay the ex carpark charge,btohqsg
Having trouble on the driver app. Permanently banned after not logging on a couple of months after not activating account at HQ.Have tried sending messages via FB (Lalamove Aamir)  live chat  and Instagram. No response. I note that on FB last post updated was on Oct 15 this year. Since then nothing published.If I'm not able to get my account active again  I'll just have to request for my deposit. Otherwise  I think should just go to TAFEP.Your thoughts?,btohqsg
They shouldn't ban just like that. That's unfair,btohqsg
TAFEP deals with employer/employee issues. You might have to sue lalamove personally as an independent contractor.,btohqsg
go down Ubi Techpark to get it settled,btohqsg
maybe I don't do often they don't prioritris me,btohqsg
No la  everyone same eh. I think is becos nobody needs that cus can 5 person go out liao,btohqsg
