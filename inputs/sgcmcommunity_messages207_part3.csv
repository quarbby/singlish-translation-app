I sell to dealer they absorb so much,btohqsg
I might as well consign 😂 even more so I know if the car need no repairs,btohqsg
End of day  after car sold  they only make a small profit,btohqsg
Still got rental  worker Comms  worker salary  worker cpf,btohqsg
All these no need pay ah,btohqsg
Haha ok means consign is much better,btohqsg
Take into consideration that your car might not be sold because the price you want is not the price others want,btohqsg
All my consign car diao at my showroom 3 months all nobody buy,btohqsg
His thinking is  if sell to dealer  dealer can sell X amt  he himself sell also can see X amt,btohqsg
Yes. I just see listing price 150k. I auto deduct and give them discount 143k also worth lel since dealer taking in 130k. For example.,btohqsg
Margin really not big for dealers  still need to fight market price.,btohqsg
But now honestly market all so high 🤣🤣🤣🤣! And we see all dealer boss drive big car 🤣🤣 it just means all the profit eaten up alr 🤣,btohqsg
But anywya I appreciate all the inputs. Enlighten my mind,btohqsg
At least know abit more facts,btohqsg
But their profit also never share with me. Why must their cost share with me?,btohqsg
Wah Mk your this perspective I very like,btohqsg
Ok now time to see how would@griffinxand@SeeGyannfight back haha,btohqsg
Then don’t sell. Wait for it to scrap get back paper value.,btohqsg
Cannot lel. It’s worst. 2019 car bought. Now sell. Profit. Buy a better car. More worth. Even if dealer eat the car with 10k profit  also profit for seller 🤣,btohqsg
That’s why I feel increase coe helps existing car owner.,btohqsg
Then own self tah any small claims or anything,btohqsg

Are you sure now the used car price is increasing? Where got? Some parf car like Mazda 3 depre is around 9k. Mazda 5 around 10k.,btohqsg
Maybe you sold to dealer at super low price and they mark up too high to sell. They can sell if the depre is around with other similar cars.,btohqsg
You sold dealer at 130k and the market price for that car is around 140k  then they cannot be posting at 150k. Wait until cow comes nobody ring bell 😅😂,btohqsg
Consign definitely can fetch higher price than selling to dealer  but there are situations where you're better off selling to dealer. E.g. you're the 3rd owner  car used to be phv  mileage dubious,btohqsg

worst car to buy is female owned car,btohqsg
But they generally more cautious. Better driving style. Less aggressive wear. Prioritise regular servicing.,btohqsg
drive too cautious the carbon buuild up too much,btohqsg
Carbon buildup influenced more by poor maintenance n short trips. Female owned cars usually better maintained n less aggressive wear compared 2 male driven cars suffering from over-revving  harsh braking or higher RPMs,btohqsg
not true. female driver dont give way when u signal car they will step and speed up act blur,btohqsg
and they dont go servicing cause car still moving😂,btohqsg
engine oil every 5k or 6mths must change for best preventive maintenance,btohqsg
drive less agressive dont mean no need maintenance,btohqsg
in short  just avoid female owned cars,btohqsg
and also avoid female drivers on fhe road. big hazard,btohqsg
Bro from ur sexist stereotype I believe u have been hurt by woman driver.  Can share what happened?,btohqsg
hurt by all the female drivers on the road being non situation awareness,btohqsg
My experience abit different.. they hoot only,btohqsg
