By then hair all drop alr,btohqsg
Someone sent this a few days back^,btohqsg
dunno should moe half to my,btohqsg
It will slowly climb up. Maybe the price outlook will help to inch MT price upwards. But actual Q3 result is in mid Nov,btohqsg
Can advise whether medtecs isit staircase down chart?,btohqsg
Can expect MT climb back 1.5x - 1.8x  since Q3 their result shoukd be good.,btohqsg
For you to say this means yesterday you loaded a lot?,btohqsg
445 i already considered as hit his prediction,btohqsg
This TG release good results still drop,btohqsg
So the same for MT also???,btohqsg
Because everyone expecting good result already mah,btohqsg
When a secret is open it's no longer a secret,btohqsg
You all think only we know TG results will be good ah,btohqsg
I just base on MT high price,btohqsg
VP holders better take profit before Fri too,btohqsg
vicplas 5mon w5w5 85 tgt 475 up 61.8% of 135- px hit high 445- watch baseline 415 cannot breakadd fib level 78.6/88.6/100watch the level as px moveand cannot be greedy,btohqsg
Share price up too much before results,btohqsg
wa vp will continue up tomrw,btohqsg
TG sux la. Go did a share split spoil everything. Old ppl loaded with cash see price drop from 9 dollar to 3 dollar sure scared out,btohqsg
I don't think anyone expect MT to have 100x profits,btohqsg
You know what time result cOme out?,btohqsg
If yes all buy big big Liao,btohqsg
How come they never announce on sgx,btohqsg
This one even BB caught out I feel,btohqsg
How much is too much.MT from 3 cents to 90 cents before result announced not too much meh?Even though got 100x profit but still from 3 cents to 90 cents is a lot leh. Why keep climbing after result announced,btohqsg
100x profit is a lot leh,btohqsg
But whether it can substain anot is a key issue,btohqsg
Need to see the rise just before results,btohqsg
You ask VP announce a 100x profits loh,btohqsg
Like TG $2 to $3 1 week before results is considered alot,btohqsg
MT after results come out  there was a huge ass gap lol,btohqsg
Please la. Their coy is small lor... 100x is easily achievable. TG/RS/UG previously already earning,btohqsg
VP today also up 40 over %  is alot alr,btohqsg
Rmb HP one day up 50% next day gone,btohqsg
+ when they first announced result. Which should be their Q1? Did their share price drop after result announce? No what,btohqsg
We are hindsight talk now leh,btohqsg
So now is VP first result announcement. Why u think it will drop after announced. If base on resulr announcement it will rise since its the first result announced,btohqsg
Whereas MT 2nd result annouce will drop,btohqsg
So like that I think mid Nov MT will drop aftee result announced lor,btohqsg
It's ok to think that way what,btohqsg
VP results very high risk i feel,btohqsg
Those who vested in MT better be warned. U won't see $2 if accordingly to G.E.M and Zane ways of interpreting how TG share price had dropped after their recent result announcement.,btohqsg
VP results isnt guaranteed to be exceptional unlike MT TG,btohqsg
Bro zane don't need argue with him lw,btohqsg
VP up so much today  no reason will still up tomorrow,btohqsg
BBs just leveraging on retailers hopes,btohqsg
hahaha vp on danger then tmr,btohqsg
When TG sell down from 3 to 2 everyone scared,btohqsg
But I know many ppl stuck in 60 70 series,btohqsg
Think results might not be good etc,btohqsg
