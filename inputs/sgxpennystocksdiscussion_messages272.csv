There are 3 cases in the community today  who are currently unlinked.*Case 59757Case 59757 is a 72 year-old male Singaporean who is employed by Certis Cisco as an aviation screening officer at Changi Airport Terminal 1. His job entails screening baggage of arrival passengers via X-ray scanners  and directing passengers to the baggage screening lanes.*He developed a cough and sore throat on 25 January but did not seek medical treatment. On 27 January  he went to work and was tested as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 28 January night  and an individual test was done later that night at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. His earlier tests from RRT ‚Äì the last being on 15 January ‚Äì were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back negative  indicating that this is likely a current infection.*It was revealed that on 28 January  Case 59757 met with 12 other individuals for tennis at the National Service Resort & Country Club (10 Changi Coast Walk). Investigations are ongoing to assess if there had been any breach of the relevant prevailing safe management measures.Case 59757 received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 25 January at the vaccination centre located at Changi Airport Terminal 4. As the vaccine does not contain live virus  he could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.*,btohqsg
So anything to look out for next week? Any tips? HahaHolding on to Oceanus...,btohqsg
Haha 20B losses crash market? Thats not even losses enough for tesla 1 session,btohqsg
Penny players who might want to earn a quick buck next Monday‚Äôs  head over to buy GMEüí™üèª buy small small maybe can earn angpao,btohqsg
But gme stock not penny lolll haha I know what u mean lol,btohqsg
You can afford to buy 1 share for 300 bucks,btohqsg
This week can make new highs? üöÄ,btohqsg
Risky. Unless they managed to round up more followers on reddit hahah,btohqsg
I think they did. 2.7m now 7.6,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs still a ‚Äúhot‚Äù topic huh,btohqsg
What price would u buy it for,btohqsg
To break this down for everyone who is worried or wants to know what to expect in the coming week:AMC current status (30JAN2021) :AMC has 44.6 million shorted shares and a grand total of 52 million shares. That means 86% of shares are shorted (by hedge funds) and 14% are being longed (all of us)Now what everyone is waiting for is when shorted shares expire and they (hedge funds) have to cover what they bet on. Keep in mind not EVERY share will expire on Monday. So we MUST hold beyond that.Today‚Äôs target (1/29) was to beat $8.63 (what hedge funds were betting it would be come Monday) and we did that closing at $13.29! AWESOME. This short will expire in 0.5 trading days (Monday)So Monday when they‚Äôre forced to cover ($8.63) they will have to buy it at its current price to cover their bet. Raising the price up even higher.But this isn‚Äôt even the best part. All of their other shorts are SIGNIFICANTLY lower. There are 9 different short stocks between $1.98-$5.96. Some of those shorts are 1.9 days away (Tue) 2.5 days (wed) 3.2 days (Thur) so the longer you hold  the higher the price gets and the more they have to cover.Over the next few trading days it is going to be a vIolent squeeze. We are at the starting line of what GME did. Hold your ground. Gains Monday are inevitable. But the gains on Tuesday-Thursday will be much higher.Short squeezes are historic: and to give you an example Volkswagen had a 46% short at $6 share price which squeezed to $110 a share back in 2008. AMC is at 84% short at $13 The percentage is significantly higher and there‚Äôs a lot more room to grow. On the high end we‚Äôre talking the possibility of hitting $150-200 a share if everyone is smart and holding until ThursdayMy recommendation:1. HOLD2. Buy more on Monday if you can afford it because it‚Äôs going to violently rise3. Enjoy the ride until AT LEAST Thursday evening when all the shorts expire and the price is at it‚Äôs highest.I am not a financial advisor nor a registered stock broker. I simply have done my DD (Due diligence) and reflecting on passed events. Every stock has risk but it‚Äôs all about risk mitigation. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity so be mindful what you‚Äôre dealing with. If you have any questions I will try my best to answer them.Happy trading  GREAT job today everyone. And don‚Äôt forget to share this or copy and paste it along other post to spread the word! I‚Äôll see you on the moon üöÄ üåö,btohqsg
If the above is true   might have some show,btohqsg
If you think the squeeze will happen  anything less than $1000 is cheap,btohqsg
As of now  for every 1 share you own  you have 1.13 buyer (hedge fund people). But DYODD,btohqsg
I hope GME doesn‚Äôt end up causing the whole market to tank. But if it does  at least my profit from GME can allow me to buy cheap stocks üòÇ Just my opinion ah,btohqsg
This is not true. I work in hedge fund and most of us in hedge funds do short trades through PB and there is no expiry period. Instead there is short borrowing fees which is based on agreed pips per month.,btohqsg
This is different from retail investors,btohqsg
At a price of $300  Melvin Capital has 400 days to cover their shorts based on their loan agreement with Citadel I think,btohqsg
Agreed. But it means if the price goes up  it becomes exponential. Hence the ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù lor. Higher price higher interest rate = urgency to cover shorts. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve understood from some basic reading up,btohqsg
Fund managers are always not stressed on the borrow fees but on whether their computed upside is changed. The fees are like peanuts.,btohqsg
We have held short positions for more than 3 years.,btohqsg
No wonder he MIA few days,btohqsg
But did y‚Äôall short more than 100% of the float shares available? How will this change anything? (If any),btohqsg
I worked at Sheng Siong before. Honestly  the base pay is low  2013 was 1.2k pm for cashiers. But bonuses and CNY free gifts etc gao gao. I part timer only also got electric toothbrush la  small ang pow etc,btohqsg
1.2k pm 6 day work week no weekends off if I may add,btohqsg
Ya free lunch or dinner depending on your shift,btohqsg
Anw the cashiers also not 16mth bonus based on the circular la.,btohqsg
Shiokkkk hahah like those woke companies like Facebook and shoppee giving free food lol,btohqsg
Ya ... I think even the managers don‚Äôt earn much? Probably 3k?,btohqsg
But 3k x 16 months wooooooo,btohqsg
Most of the store managers are Jiuhukia also. So coy needs to factor in levy for S Pass,btohqsg
That's why the base pay not high,btohqsg
Convert bk ringgit is high for them already,btohqsg
Ya that's why most are Malaysian or Chinese. Singaporeans usually is part timer student or auntie liao,btohqsg
Haha I see ppl gian the X mth bonus  but if ask them work 6 day work week no wkends off they will want or not üòÇ,btohqsg
The Malaysians are nicer to me üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Hahaha ikr.Then compare to NTUC when both business models are entirely different ü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
But ntuc alot locals wrkin   n I assume pay range maybe around ss range,btohqsg
I don't know  but I would think it's higher than SS by a bit,btohqsg
But I feel NTUC workload is less üòÇ cos a lot of automated counters. Sheng siong you see the queue you jitao sian one,btohqsg
But conversely  long queue time also pass faster,btohqsg
Ic . But add in bonus  ss definitely much more,btohqsg
Fair price also got give benefits and bonus to staff la.. just not 16 months for sure and they don‚Äôt tell the whole world,btohqsg
Previous years maybe the bonus is ang pow during CNY.,btohqsg
Saw on EDMW. NTUC pay so much for rent üò±,btohqsg
Hahaha  business model not up to par. LL. Last year was a life time golden opportunity  but from observation ........,btohqsg
If last year everyone chiong NTUC but profit margin slim  means what ah? üòÇ,btohqsg
Maybe give out too much $1 breakfast by brother Chee alr,btohqsg
Btw sorry but I find it damn cringe they call each other brother and PAP internally call each other comrades lol,btohqsg
Unfortunately  I‚Äôm not the PM and I only run the operations. I just informing you that your logic on the short coverage due to expiry is wrong as this was never an investment factor for short strategies.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sharing on this to avoid others making the wrong decision based on wrong information.,btohqsg
But 1 sgd is 3 ringgit!...imagine 16 months of sgd bonus in ringgit!,btohqsg
If they save up....they can make down-payment for houses in msia,btohqsg
I not a business man. But I feel NTUC overstretched them. Definitely not every outlet will meet the monthly quota. So other outlets will have to cover the deficit.  Same as in shares  should not be invested into multiple counters. A few good counters will be profitable.My view.,btohqsg
A big flaw in argument. Comments?,btohqsg
Not everyone getting 16 mths btw,btohqsg
They need some loss makers to maintain presence lor,btohqsg
need some views on the mentioned.  feel free to comment anyone,btohqsg
May I when what is the date for sri trang glove ..date qtr  result released? Thank you,btohqsg
Should be 15 or 16th Feb,btohqsg
I see at this point post individual counter chart no use since most counters will be affected by market sentiment. This time I'll do Index chart instead. I'll use penny chart instead of STI because I think our pennies movement affect overall market sentiment more than STI.Catalist Index closed around the MA support n came to historical support zone as shown by the big shaded square on the left. So this coming week should have some rebound. Since traders confidence were affected n Dow not stable  I think the rebound can't last long. My prediction is early of this coming week market should be better. Later part of the week should see selling again until it hit the trendline & paused a while. Just my 2-cents. Just a prediction nia thus I may be wrong. Anyway  still good to reduce your exposure for the time being. If there's a rebound  take the opportunity to sell into strength. I think Feb is not an easy month to trade. Dyodd....,btohqsg
Do take note that at this point the overall trend is still up. A retracement is normal after moving up for so long. We won't know when the real bear will come or how much it will retrace. So don't take it as my post mean we are in the long term bear already. When we are unsure  it's good to be on alert so we don't get caught with big losses.,btohqsg
YZJ also high volume of short sell,btohqsg
I try with my very limited knowledge...Mathatically  only 14% long doesnt sound right to me. If the 86% shorts are borrowed to short or naked short  it's not going to affect the 100% base. The long holders are still 52Mil shares..As long as shorts is not exceeding 100%  strictly speaking there's no squeeze.,btohqsg
Who is the major shareholders is AMC?,btohqsg
Exactly the borrow rate is what they care about,btohqsg
They short 86%There must be 86% of buyers somewhere. Why only 14% buyersThe rest sell to casper?,btohqsg
Ya I don't understand why only say 14%,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt understand too. Unless they say at this point of time the wsb bought at most 14%Since balance 86% in other insti/ retail handsBut still the maths is simply grabbing water straws,btohqsg
I just hope this saga over soon. Giving me unease...funds going bankrupt is no joke...the subsequent impact on the broader market can be very serious...machiam subprime + global financial crisis together?? Then we all can up car liao...retailers might win the battle but lose the war in the end..,btohqsg
A possible deleveraging exercise may take place. Gme is just the spark to the house of cards,btohqsg

Dai gei heng ong huat ah!,btohqsg
Tommorow Korea/Japan/Australia/China econmic data release predicted to be bearish. Unless there is any government intervention  market should open red. Glove company should do well but have to maintain cautious outlook especially Top Glove price movement. UG result set to release on 4th Feb follow by STA on 15 or 16th Feb both expecting to surpass analyst expectation. SIA should take a hit with the news of green lane suspension for 3 month with 3 countries. Pay attention to gold and silver price movement. Investors likely to sway by WSB on their next short squeeze target which is silver so trading price for silver and gold will likely be volatile.,btohqsg
Any a dollar local stocks to buy ? Any tips? Hahah,btohqsg
