"can i ask something about Shielding? what happens if i shield my SA  but my OA is not enough to provide for the full RA FRS? when i ""un-invest"" my SA  will the amount be automatically top up when i ""un-invest""?",btohqsg
Hey Chris  after filling in my email add in the first page  when I got redirected to the cimb page  they ask  'are u referred by a friend?' Shd I put yes or no? They also ask  'Do you have a promotion code?' what do I fill in if any?,btohqsg
No need fill in  as long as you've clicked through my singsaver link,btohqsg
Generally shielding is for people who have enough OA to form the FRS amount for RA so to be honest  im not confirmed about the treatment of funds uninvested in this case,btohqsg
Ok applied thru your link already. Saw the fine print need to spend 988 within 60 days of card approval too?,btohqsg

"It will not auto swip SA to RA after you unshield at age 55. However  CPF will ""autuoswip"" SA to RA at age 65 to form FRS before the payout. If you want to maintain your SA  you may top up RA to FRS with cash if any.",btohqsg
People used to shield their OA (the first 20k earns extra 1%) when taking HDB loan  because based on the old rule  your OA will be wiped out. After that  the rule was changed. Now  people have the option to leave up to 20k in their OA.Hope the gov will change the rule for SA to benefit the people.,btohqsg
Is Dbs yuu card any good ? :),btohqsg
Thank you for replying.*new updateCause I brought the extended warranty (tv 1700 + extended 200+). Now they are offering either a replacement tv (rrp 999) or a store credit of 999. Which one should I take? Is the value fair? If I choose store credit  which brand you guys will recommend? The store doesn‚Äôt carry TCL or XM. Only have Samsung  LG  Sony  sharp and Philip üòûI just want a reliable and long lasting tv.,btohqsg
In my experience Sony bravia quite reliable followed by LG,btohqsg
Like that then don‚Äôt pick sharp/Philip.. the other 3 should be safe..personally I feel LG smart tv user interface quite polish and intuitive .. if u want android tv option then go with Sony,btohqsg

This CIMB hotline service is almost nonexistent. Called the main hotline and cc hotline  both not picking up. Tried the option of leaving a voice message which they said would call back after one working day  also nv call back.,btohqsg
It is only during this period of interest hike as they offer good rates . I think is long wait for most banks now. Previously I used to rate cimb hotline much better compared to other banks.,btohqsg
You just continue to hold and put on speaker phone. I manage to talk to them yesterday and the day before,btohqsg
I manage to call on the night time instead,btohqsg
Ya understandable I call cimb before at Office hours lunch time ok quite nice talk too,btohqsg
Hi all üòä I have a cpfia account and have been investing my OA through poems .I realise I have about 8k to invest in SA and wanted to do so into S27. May I check if I can just purchase it through poems stating SRS ? What are the requirements needed to invest SA funds ? Do I need to open any additional account or just CPFIA is sufficient ? I saw there‚Äôs an option for SRS so I didn‚Äôt consider endowus for now,btohqsg
Having such a horrible time with HSBC..takes more than a month to process cards and only after reaching out to them a month after getting my card to ask about my samsonite luggage  they are telling me that you‚Äôll have to opt in for marketing to be eligible for it ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Yeah it sucks but this is mentioned in the t&cs,btohqsg
Hi  do you happen to know if I have charged the air tickets to DBS women's World  would the travel partners be covered for it and if it covers for covid19?,btohqsg

Transfer out ($Salary - $500) =$XXi think,btohqsg
in the desktop website  when you go into your account details  they actually have a summary for it,btohqsg
Maybe hold too much cc card ?,btohqsg
not really  assuming salary not credited on 1st of month  need to calculate how much to leave in the account such that average daily balance is $500 above last month,btohqsg
I have youtrip  but don‚Äôt see this  is this targeted?,btohqsg
