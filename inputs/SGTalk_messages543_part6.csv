Society and people don't mature from infantilisation.,btohqsg
And some adults do behave like children,btohqsg
Not the job of the gov or other adults to save adults from making poor decisions in their life.,btohqsg
If they're gonna fuck up they're gonna fuck up no matter how many safety nets or guardrails you put in place.,btohqsg
That's like saying no need wear condoms coz you might get STDs anyway,btohqsg
Guardrails are there to prevent. If there are no guardrails then what's the point of having a govt at all,btohqsg
Whether we agree with the guardrails or not is another matter,btohqsg
U might think it's excessive  to others is necessary,btohqsg
Very clear you and I are on opp sides of the spectrum.,btohqsg
What would be reasonable to you?,btohqsg
Like how much control is appropriate in this case,btohqsg
This SG60 voucher amount being given out is not much more than the annual GSTV and the extra COL handouts.,btohqsg
If those can be given out in cash direct ,btohqsg
I don't see why this SG60 voucher needs to be gatekept behind vouchers.,btohqsg
Rather have the flexibility since I know what I will use the money on,btohqsg
I'm not gonna go to MBS and lose it all üòÇ,btohqsg
Or hang flower like some morkn,btohqsg
Just going to MBS you alr lose money before you play a single game.,btohqsg
If it were up to me I make sure all HFJs get shut down and banned permanently.,btohqsg
I rather expand and retain GL red light industry than let HFJs exist.,btohqsg
I've seen those places before. Been in those places before to pick drunk ppl up and drive them home in their cars before.,btohqsg
Agreed. Some people don‚Äôt know adulthood exist.,btohqsg
A other sensitive issue but I see ur point,btohqsg
It is what it is üòë,btohqsg
"It's not sensitive at all if you ask me  only to the religious and so-called ""conservative"" people who think that the best way to live is to police the morality of society they live in and the sex lives of others.",btohqsg
The way i see it is they want control.,btohqsg
Not so much control  more like artificially induce spending in certain places for certain business industries.,btohqsg
Lol  you say this to me for free  other guys need pay money to Rurusama to say that to them.,btohqsg
Control as in they only want u to spend on those businesses that need it.,btohqsg
Which is a large chunk of the voting population üòÅ,btohqsg
Disagree  I think smaller than expected.,btohqsg
They're just louder because they got the megaphone.,btohqsg
Perfect eg of adults not growing up  innit? üòÇ,btohqsg
How should i put it? Very often i like western way of doing things yet somehow i feel there is no control (can be bad or good). Like i see their Law drama  of coz not entirely true. But you will tend to compare to sg  how different is it.,btohqsg
We can learn a lot from the Scandinavian countries,btohqsg
I wouldn't want American democracy here though.,btohqsg
Yes culture differences. But u will think if that is possible there  how will it affect asian countries etc‚Ä¶very interesting,btohqsg
There is no democracy in sg,btohqsg
U think there is but the truth is none,btohqsg
But I also think that having 2 equally powerful parties working for the common good is a pipe dream,btohqsg
So early talk about political issues?,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt sleep the whole night .-.,btohqsg
I‚Äôd like some of your melatonin thanks,btohqsg
How nice to be young again,btohqsg
I went for a morning walk before making a healthy breakfast after watching sunrise üòÅ,btohqsg
more to restrict what they can and cannot buy  namely funnel $$ into corporations they know they can tax back the $$,btohqsg
too bad I ain‚Äôt getting shit üòÇ,btohqsg

If it is to help local businesses  neighbourhood stores  hawkers etc  i would think it is still ok,btohqsg
Instead of going to the massage shop downstairs for 50 dollar HJs? üòÅüòÇ,btohqsg
