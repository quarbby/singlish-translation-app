Guys  can we continue to use chocolate card for mobile contactless payment ?,btohqsg
Now cannot even use their choc visa card for online transactions zzz,btohqsg
r u certain abt what ure saying haha,btohqsg
For public transport  amaze will not charge the 1%  am I right?,btohqsg
If yes. Then I‚Äôll replace SC Smart with Amaze for public transport.,btohqsg
For public transport they charge you 50 cents every $15 you clock lol,btohqsg
How did you come to this conclusion(my keyboard autocorrected to concussion at first  which is also somehow accurate...),btohqsg
Saving accounts. SSB. Tbills.Oh cpf üòÅ,btohqsg
But sc smart has min spending of $800,btohqsg
will charge 1% (min $0.50) for local spend.citi rewards excludes public transport anyway,btohqsg

This should have been the there since the beginning of axs removal.Unless who started the fire puts down the fire  it's tough.,btohqsg
hope he can keep his word,btohqsg
i only wanted them to keep their BIG BIG ADVERTISEMENT of 2 miles per dollar for AXS payments.. at least for a few months la.. not just one month..zzzzzz,btohqsg
survive first and then think about better lifeüòÇ,btohqsg
It‚Äôs too good to be true to last any longer la üòÖ,btohqsg
They clearly underestimated the amount of BILLS we can pay!! lol,btohqsg
but how can they NOT know this? they should already have factored in the cost of 2k miles per user per monthanyway.. that is what? $40 per user per month assuming 2 cents per max mile,btohqsg
I am not able to pay bills with my CF debit card,btohqsg
My CF debit card not working since noon.,btohqsg
I still got 100sgd in chocolate financeüòÇ,btohqsg
The debit card still can use on transport,btohqsg
I feel they completely underestimated just how many transactions would happen on the card  even excluding AXS. What‚Äôs annoying for me is I‚Äôd rather they have a separate account for linked card  that pays no or little interest  so it‚Äôs always liquid. Card disruption is just so bad for customer confidence  especially when the machine tells me ‚Äúno funds available‚Äù FML. All my bills are set to chocolate card  so do I have to reset? How long the disruption for card users will be? No answers at all from them üòë,btohqsg
They are not aware how many loopholes AXS has,btohqsg
They should have started with a small group of users for trial first,btohqsg
I'm just wondering if withdraw now  the 3 to 10days wait does it mean we can still surely get our money back?,btohqsg
have no other option but trust them,btohqsg
so far all pointers given is that it will come back,btohqsg
May I know what happen to chocolate finance? I see rumours at xhs. Is it still safe to put $$$ in there?,btohqsg
Use the debit card better. You don't get interest during the wait.,btohqsg
no bank run? they need to issue POFMA to business times thenhttps://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/chocolate-finance-suspends-instant-withdrawals-due-high-demand?utm_source=telegram&utm_medium=social-organicAccording to a notice on the Chocolate Finance mobile app on Monday (Mar 10)  the platform is currently experiencing an unusually high volume of withdrawal requests  in what is likely to be Singapore‚Äôs first bank run of a platform-based financial services company.,btohqsg
Anyone facing issue with using Choc Card for Cardup,btohqsg
Does this mean out wait for money back might not go through?,btohqsg
Hi anyone aware  jw marriot for wedding isit considered under travel category,btohqsg
FUNDS ARE SAFU!!! STOP WITHDRAWING! KEEP IT IN FOR MORE INTEREST WHILE WE WAIT FOR INSTANT WITHDRAWAL!,btohqsg
Hey guys I just realize the dbs altitude card I gotten last year  I didn't receive the sign up bonus miles based on whats reflected on the paylah app. Is it too late to ask dbs?,btohqsg
Does anyone have the same problem as me that I can‚Äôt link my bank account to chocolate finance to withdraw my money,btohqsg
People are not withdrawing because it's not safe. People are withdrawing because of the loss in trust in the company's words.,btohqsg
Why u sound like binance CZ lol,btohqsg
