it seems hectic for now because it is still the transition period  like... CONFINEMENT WEEKS,btohqsg
ya ik it's cancerous for you,btohqsg
you will adjust to it so just hold on there,btohqsg
legit what  confinement weeks water parade damn pain,btohqsg
transitioning to lectures are not easy,btohqsg
YOUR 5 MINUTES STARTED 4 MINUTES AGO,btohqsg
yeah gets  it is not easy now but you will improve also mah,btohqsg
i got church conf during the weekend then mon-wed cca camp,btohqsg
it's gonna be worse when im exco+class comm ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
+ OGL + 3rd cca ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I have nvr seen 3 cca before uh  but I did 2ccas+physics rep +tdp before uh so....,btohqsg
Embarrassingâ€¦ they doing all kinds of shit cause of the boycott LMFAOOAOA,btohqsg
But like i think de silva make the timetable until like all cca on same day,btohqsg
do you think they will remove MCQ for Science?,btohqsg
Science has always been using a local version though,btohqsg
If they remove it likely will be for both O and A,btohqsg
If I go Europe confirm sia,btohqsg
Literally covid stopped me from travelling for 5 years,btohqsg
oh so similar to now (they like reverting back to the past sia),btohqsg
they are freaking moving back to the old syllabus...now also only count 3 H2 only (unless ur H1 do btr than h2 to pull ur rp up),btohqsg
PW was a nightmare coz the pw chers dictate ur chances of getting A tbh,btohqsg
but mcq can be good or bad. it can also be tricky,btohqsg
Not old syllabus but more of calculation method for RP? But it is also not the same. Back then  it was okay to read just three H2 (or A level) subjects and there was no need for a contrasting subject as well. Weightage of GP in RP was different. Also  MTL must be counted in RP and given same weightage as GP  but not now,btohqsg
Making pw pass/fail was a good decision,btohqsg
A lot of lower tier jcs face some kind of biasness due to that subject,btohqsg
Tanjong Katong Girls' School  Temasek Secondary School  Westwood secondary school  commonwealth secondary school,btohqsg
that is why i say o lvl econs is like my sch compete among ourselves,btohqsg
my pw cher barely do anything in class,btohqsg
on the flipside  if u have a good cher  100% class dist is possible,btohqsg
and then coz he was my gp tutor and civics tutor also,btohqsg
it was just awkward among us,btohqsg
like when he pass me my results  i could see sth in his face bruh,btohqsg
tbh if he is like that he should not end up in mainstream school (not being mean but it sometimes disturbs others),btohqsg
like my brother is from sped school,btohqsg
i read recently got 1 autistic kid graduated fr YIJC,btohqsg
it is sad some parents cant accept it and expect their child to behave normally which obviously not gonna be happening,btohqsg
like have u read about the bukit timah thing,btohqsg
btw i just saw this about more schools should offer econs,btohqsg
do people really think we have advantafe lmao,btohqsg
the econs cohort in Os is < 100 people out of how many people that take H2 / H1 econs lmao,btohqsg
econs cohort at Os is actually basically less than 20 per these 4 schools,btohqsg
my sch alr had 350 ppl H2 cohort,btohqsg
i was considered an outlier in TM,btohqsg
coz i was the only one doing well in hybrid S4/5 lmao,btohqsg
im getting scared entering the working world soon,btohqsg
two ways of doing well in exams. one is understand it to the point it becomes second nature; other is just grind until you recognise the patterns,btohqsg
first one is better but takes a lot more and is harder to achieve,btohqsg
i don't believe you were as discerning back then as you are now,btohqsg
i'm just saying the issue you cite isn't just an sg education system thing,btohqsg
it's a young stupid fuck thing,btohqsg
