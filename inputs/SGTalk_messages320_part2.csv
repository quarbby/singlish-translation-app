Go to your switch box.see is it one of the switched jumped.If yes  keep it off and turn on the main,btohqsg
Generally it is likely one of the circuits in your ELCB/breaker,btohqsg
If everything is turned back on and nothing comes on  check the mains incoming where the metre is.. there are another 2 breakers there,btohqsg
If it trips again after turning on the mains start isolating the switch circuits in the unit by turning all off and after 10 mins  turn on the breakers check that nothing trips.. then individually area by area turn on your switch sockets again..,btohqsg
Once it trips again  either an appliance or a switch has issues. Isolate those and get someone who knows how to trace those to take a look.. usually it's mostly an appliance issue,btohqsg
Does anyone know if those with ELCB  do they need to change to RCCB under the new guidelines...,btohqsg
