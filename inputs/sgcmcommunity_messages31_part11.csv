Fuss and frills free car mah ðŸ˜… The face-lift altis now looks better + interior quite spacious sia.I once borrowed a friend's for a few days. I think can attain 15km/l,btohqsg
Honestly Mazda can be the same but very little in SG,btohqsg
when you have so many of one type of cars  the parts tend to be cheaper hence maint also cheaper,btohqsg
thatsnwhy toyota honda etc all the parts so cheap,btohqsg
Lexus also. Make the looks abit more classy only. Engine still Toyota.,btohqsg
lotus everything can spoil except the engine,btohqsg
1zz and 2zz engine very solid,btohqsg
Loads of options as well  really nice,btohqsg
Hi all  thinking of getting a first hand Kia sonet this coming October. Any driver reviews? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
i am showing you my fuel economy for the 3rd time. and i never miscount!,btohqsg
I think ur calculation is biased bro. Need to get a 3rd party.,btohqsg
Getting abt 20 per liter with a super heavy right foot. Driving the 2.5 hybrid currently,btohqsg
I'm driving ascent sports version now. Don't find it boring at all,btohqsg
The new Camry looks good. I like it,btohqsg
But for cat A car  I still stick by Mazda 3 ðŸ¤“,btohqsg
So far nobody flag my Mazda 3 yet (but previous vezel yes ðŸ˜¢),btohqsg
Wah redline still 12.28km/l.Insane good FC for your 2L engine,btohqsg
i think the fuel saving is due partially to istop,btohqsg
my car is mazda 6 2.5 top of the range model. loves the many features in there.,btohqsg
Nice. The last time I drove a 2.5L moderately gently also can't smell 9km/l ðŸ˜…Redline don't know maybe not even 8,btohqsg
that redline of course i didnt do long. it's a test for a fe mins only. did you use istop?,btohqsg
i rev abit my fc increase alot,btohqsg
tryna live laugh love through the high fuel prices but lately it has been hard,btohqsg
i noticed the revv hardly exceeds 3000,btohqsg
at 2400  it is already 120kmh,btohqsg
so alwasy stays at low  rpm,btohqsg
but ii spend most time on highway on balance,btohqsg
Volvo 130kmh about 1.8k on 8th gear,btohqsg
what is high? that is what it is the skyactiv gearbox,btohqsg
wanna know my m3? it is 3000 rpm at 120,btohqsg
honestly thats abit high dont you think,btohqsg
no no. not gearing. well you are partially correct. it is at this hear because the engine has the torque to pull it,btohqsg
"it depends how how the engine is tuned. in order to do better fuel economy  revv as low as possible while still able to give the ""pull""",btohqsg
no la. that is why i only use it once a week to maintain the car,btohqsg
it is wallet breaking fuel consumption.,btohqsg
if i put a small engine to haul your sx90  it definitely wont be able to cruise at 1800 rpm in 8th gear. no torque,btohqsg
XC90 use same engine as mine leh,btohqsg
xc is suv  S is sedan,btohqsg
your engine is turbo. high torque  so low rpm,btohqsg
honestly turbo/non turbo   we are able to afford and enjoy the car is what matters most,btohqsg
who cares what other ppl think of your car hor  who paying for the car anyways,btohqsg
funny why after geely took over volvo changed a lot,btohqsg
did geely fire the old designers,btohqsg
its good change in my opinion,btohqsg
suddenly all the old fashioned coffin looking cars are gone,btohqsg
we all have to move forward and change somehow,btohqsg
the change in volvo is like the change in mercedes benz. suddenly so stylish and trendy,btohqsg
i believe its still the same designers but under ford  there was alot of cost saving involved,btohqsg
i wish bmw is like that,btohqsg
last time it cannot rival cars like the germans  now its very much closer.,btohqsg
