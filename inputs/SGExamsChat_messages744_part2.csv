If I were YI principal I would invite ri/hci students to all the matches yi is in  then get the students to yell ‚ÄúL1R5 20‚Äù as punishment,btohqsg
Maybe only then they‚Äôll realise how insensitive their remarks were,btohqsg
I feel like that isnt fair,btohqsg
1. Not all the YI students did it so the innocent ones shouldnt be punished2. I dont think its right to fight fire with fire in this context3. Idt the ri hci students would be on board with it. Ppl will say ri hci elitist.,btohqsg
This is not it‚Ä¶it is just such an immature way to do things,btohqsg
Actl the 3rd pt is the most impt tbh,btohqsg
"Yea imo its like ""you broke my toys so i must break yours""",btohqsg
I can‚Äôt think of a reason why the RI/HCI people will willing do this  they will be like what kind of principal does this,btohqsg
Hmm yeah actually. They would be more preoccupied with high flyer things,btohqsg
I was thinking that sometimes ppl need a taste of their own medicine if not they won‚Äôt learn,btohqsg
If the ri/hci principal get the letter/email from yijc principal  they prob js gonna laugh with admins and then delete or toss the letter in the trash,btohqsg
