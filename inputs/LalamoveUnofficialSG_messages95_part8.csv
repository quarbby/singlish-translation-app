Sensors n stuff shd last longer in EVs due to the lower heat energy emitted compared to ICE,btohqsg
"""There are only around 20 moving parts in an electric engine  compared with nearly 2 000 in an ICE (internal combustion engine)""",btohqsg
An EV runs on wheels too. The drive train alone has more than 20 moving parts.,btohqsg
that part is the same for both ICE and EV. we're comparing the relative complexity differences between the two.,btohqsg
nobody is saying it's simple  just simpler.,btohqsg
These problems only affect those who buy these cars out of warranty in a few years time and when they due to be serviced. We would only know then if they are simple to service and maintain as compared to your regular ICE. The true cost to repair and service an EV is still relatively unknown.,btohqsg
Brake pad/rotors dun even need to be changed so often like ICE cars,btohqsg
Ev is instant torque. They are very fast. There should be more pressure on the brakes imo.,btohqsg
/kickbelieve your mother butt got gold.,btohqsg
Huh? Ever heard of regenerative braking in EV?,btohqsg
No stepping of brake pedal is even required to stop an EV. Brake pads in EV can last twice as long  if not even longer,btohqsg
That's great  I always see car driver itchy leg step brake for nothing along the expressway  constant speed  safety distance away. Want to maintain speed  just let go of accelerator  no need brake unless you want to slow down.,btohqsg
These very normal  I also kana few time.Now I kana is; i send 6 send site  suddenly it say all clear  make me panic  lucky still got address on the item.By the way   check with u guys  u all using ur own car or rent can to do the delivery?,btohqsg
I feel rent car not worth it,btohqsg
I tried using rent car suzuki,btohqsg
7 hrs i use one tank LOL,btohqsg
Wa  1 day earn $150  top up full tank  then 1 day only earn maybe $70.How much u earn for 1 day?,btohqsg
i talk to one foodpanda guy  he ride bike one day $150  before petrol  usually petrol give u tops $10 for bike. then take home 140 before all the wear and tear,btohqsg
I switch from llm to panda tooMotorbikeIf anyone keen can Pm me,btohqsg
I never do full day  i start around 11 do until 6 like that,btohqsg
i think panda grab do more food deliveries,btohqsg
but nede to pay the $70 fee  lalamove no need  so those do for fun/part time   llm quite good,btohqsg
Must do full day then will see $,btohqsg
Or maybe if got own car,btohqsg
I feel rental car do food delivery or llm nt worth it cos the petrol cost and rental,btohqsg
Is there an issue on lalamove driver apps?,btohqsg
Not that I know of. I'm already delivering on the app üòÅ,btohqsg
Perhaps u need to restart ur phone or somethinf,btohqsg
How long do you have to not do lalamove until you get the reactivation booster bonus,btohqsg
Any help would be appreciated  thanks :),btohqsg
As long as u canüòÇ.. Usually 3rd week can already  for me laa.. Duno for the rest.,btohqsg
After reactivation booster bonus  still got a better version one? Like do 1 job can get higher incentive? Ha,btohqsg
Usually 4jobs only baüòÇ.. If everytime got higher incentives... Then I believe 90% LLM drivers/riders gonna start that pattern not doing LLMüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Ha  usually I wait until activation boost  2 jobs only. Those full-timer LLM rider cannot start this pattern what  they will have less than $50 income a month.,btohqsg
They can only go for Silver/Gold streak bonus  which relies on quantity to earn bonus.,btohqsg
Can Lalamove users request specifics drivers?,btohqsg
"there is a ""fan"" system that allows users to prioritize certain drivers.",btohqsg
Wah  so extreme if like that might well get Stephen handphone number and contact him directly. Why let Llm earn?,btohqsg
llm use bike do quite good  everytime I travel for work or leisure  around sg  I juz see if got anything along the way  üòÇ,btohqsg
Car... With 6 or 7 hours a day.. Can get almost 3k a month...,btohqsg
If sticker driver anytime.. non sticker is effort,btohqsg
How many trip for 1 day?,btohqsg
3k a month is $100/day. 5-10 trips?,btohqsg
Assuming talking about revenue not profit.,btohqsg
