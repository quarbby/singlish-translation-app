1st time going for the HSBC EGA promo  may I clarify once after we sent the SMS and very sure that we did not participate the previous promo  we can just place the find in our EGA account for the bonus interest?,btohqsg
crmc excludes all travel mcc related transactions. also  due to the amazelocalcap (1k per calendar month before they start to charge you 1% per transaction)  you might want to use crmc direct (don‚Äôt use crmc for in app purchases!) for eligible transactions,btohqsg
Good with or without Amaze card.,btohqsg
will not count to MYR category  get 8% if fall under the 5 selected categories,btohqsg
Any additional thing we need to do?,btohqsg
Fulfill the 1% bonus interest from Everyday+ rewards if you haven't.,btohqsg

I'm using the same email for all my pp acc  diff acc names. Pro tip: add card name to acct name to differentiate them.,btohqsg
nothing to do with exclude at their discretion. Buying capita evoucher from app is mcc 6540 which is clearly excluded in TnC,btohqsg
I am trying to express that bank have all the discretion to exclude any transaction even if it is not clearly written in tnc. Just like what maybank have done to snack.,btohqsg

is uob privimiles visa card now not that good? for cardup,btohqsg
hey guys quick question. is there any way to get cashback for paying standard chartered credit card bill? excl. EGA GIRO  cardup  or just no set up in general. maybe more of say using a debit card to pay via AXS estation,btohqsg

Have you tried CardUp calculator? They have a list of cards that are likely eligible there.,btohqsg
as in the 1.8% fee promo?,btohqsg
dbs vantage and apply promo code SAVERENT179,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Yes  I think it‚Äôs 0.6% but no reward guarantees depending on the MCC CardUp used to charge for rent. I think only one of the two qualifies,btohqsg
mcc is 6513  excluded from rewards on uob prvi,btohqsg
I think going back to Vanatge is the safest,btohqsg
Will it come with drink? Or the restaurant will earn a bit more from drink purchase?,btohqsg

For overseas hotel bookings ontrip.comand experiences  metro card etc bookings on klook/trip.com  should we use Citi rewards (without amaze) or dbs women‚Äôs? Or both are good?,btohqsg
Can't use Citi rewards as those are under travel. Dbs women world mastercard is good to use.,btohqsg
But rides on Grab  Comfort  Ryde are not considered travel right? üòÖ so good to use Citi rewards for them? Not sure about wallet top-ups,btohqsg
Rides hailing app are ok to use Citi rewards.wallet top up is no.,btohqsg
Will i earn miles if i buy flight tickets from airasia website via my amaze  that is linked with citi rewards?,btohqsg

Did miles from ur other spend on hsbc Revo get credited?,btohqsg
I only had that 1 txn for the month of sep,btohqsg
Time to check w HSBC cso,btohqsg
if posted in Sep  maybe check with HSBC why did not get bonus points  what is the mcc and is it online spend.,btohqsg
How do we go about doing that? Do we need to go to the lounge first to redeem for a coupon or wat?Sorry first time hearing this...,btohqsg
Go to the restaurant listed in pp app and tell them you want to use priority pass. That's all.,btohqsg
I heard about using amaze + Maybank F&F. Is this better than using just the Maybank F&F for malaysia? Petrol and groceries onlyWhat‚Äôs the pros of converting to SGD versus paying in ringgit and getting the bonus cash back?,btohqsg
Please search maybank fnf for reply on your question. Many have ask before,btohqsg
if via Amaze save on fx fees  get 8% assuming the mcc falls under ur selected categories,btohqsg
Ok thank you! Just to clarify  if I use the amaze in other countries (other than Malaysia) it will still work the same way right?,btohqsg

How u able to do that? I tried to apply thru the app but there is no option for me,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not too sure. It was an option for me in the app so I just applied and it went through.,btohqsg
Do you have an existing credit card with DBS? Did you update your income with them?,btohqsg
Yes i have existing card with them... i last few months just requested for credit limit increase.. so i did update my income with them i suppose..,btohqsg
From my understanding  as long as you can see option to apply for dbs vantage  you can get it. If not  still probably need higher income.,btohqsg
Maybe you didn't hit their income requirements buffer?What I know is the strictly block anyone below $120k income from seeing the card  but if there are people who can apply with lesser  then there might be a buffer that they give (which they will still approve case by case).,btohqsg
A quick question about KrisPay:Amaze card linked Citi Rewards by apply pay in KrisPay  will I earn 4 or 0.4 miles per sgd??,btohqsg
I see... oh well then... thanks!!,btohqsg
Thanks for the prompt answer  Anthony! üôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg
I think as long never hit at least $100k  I doubt they will approve also.,btohqsg
Some say amaze wallet some say wise.,btohqsg
Some say iChange if you exchange RM most,btohqsg
Only for new cardup user  right? And I‚Äôm not new,btohqsg

Yes. Add your AMEX issued credit card and you can pay through the app. Only at merchants that accepts AMEX pay.,btohqsg
Oh so this method only alllows original AMEX cards? Cannot use UOB One or UOB Absolute Cashback (AMEX),btohqsg
I see. Thanks. Seems there is no other options for coffee shop paynow,btohqsg
Anthony u want to reread the question. Only dining mcc will work if is dining bonus cat. Spending overseas doesnt make it travel mcc,btohqsg
DCS Cards App with UnionPay cards also can.,btohqsg
Is ur lady card base version or lady solitaire with dining and travel bonus categoriesm,btohqsg
I think the main thing to clear up is spending overseas does not make it travel mcc lol,btohqsg
Solitaire  but i only have dining and fashion category selected now  so travel cannot be selected until next Q,btohqsg
hi does mcc 5995 falls under 10x for crmc,btohqsg
Use with Amaze and everything is under 10x ü§£ So since i use Amaze  i dont really mind the MCC's anymore  except hotels/travel/restaurants in hotel,btohqsg
oh really? except travel and hotels right haha,btohqsg
And also careful of restaurants located in hotels,btohqsg
For the HSBC Live+ can waive lifetime annual waiver fee?,btohqsg

I realised I have the citi rewards visa card that I never activated for years probably,btohqsg
Ah ok thanks  I wonder if they would be able to send a replacement card for the visa version if I request for it,btohqsg
It‚Äôs precious  you can‚Äôt apply for it now even if you want to.,btohqsg
Oh I see  I probably need to dig around to see if the card is in a drawer somewhere,btohqsg
As long as the mcc is dining,btohqsg
Most of the time  we be using amaze + crmc. For selective spending on travel expense like hotel  airline etc then we need to remind ourselves to switch cards like citi premiers.  For this combination  it may not earn the most points but it is more the most convenient and I don‚Äôt worry points expiring. I not a high spender so I can take my time to accumulate points and miles.,btohqsg
Guys if I use BOC family card in popular bookstore Malaysia  do I get 5% cashback?,btohqsg

Still don‚Äôt seem too bad a deal as lounge food sometimes quite jialat. If want alcohol though still better to head to lounge.,btohqsg
Hi can I check if HSBC travelone cc now allows card holder and the guests to share the 4 lounge access? any restriction on how many guests can bring in everytime?,btohqsg

U can search food panda app some stalls can do self pickup then you can earn CC points but stalls are limited.,btohqsg
anyone tried before? called hsbc and they advised the guests need to have sup cardsüò¢,btohqsg
You can take the screenshot here and bang table if they dont allow. It literally said ‚Äúguest(s)‚Äù,btohqsg
Usually I go to lounge to spend time  not really in to the food,btohqsg
Did anyone tried using CitiPayall for manulife insurance.does it work?,btohqsg

Can I ask for Maybank Family and Friends credit card  is the ringgit spend counted into the 5 categories chosen?,btohqsg
So ringgit doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs within the chosen 5 categories?,btohqsg
If ur spending is within the 5 chosen categories  try to use amaze card to reduce the fx fee. If ur spending is not within the 5 chosen categories  then u can use f&f card directly  it will go into the 6th category.. Make sure u hit the min spending of 800 for that mth.,btohqsg
Within 2 months from end of the quarter.,btohqsg
Gotta try. I heard many mariott properties dont qualify for 4nf.,btohqsg
It may not even be eligible. Many marriot properties are not full pre-payment.Better off with accor properties if u want to do 4nf,btohqsg
Received sms from hsbc for dbs card giro. Does that mean my giro setup is successful? I didnt put sticky note üòÇ,btohqsg
Nope. Now you pray the mail says successful.I received this message 5 times.,btohqsg
I checked with cso  the hsbc bank acc no listed starts from 4th to 12th number pending approval,btohqsg
The next best way is when DBS sends you letter back saying successful.,btohqsg
Thanks melvin and mouse. I've setup citi n uob so far all got it right first time. Only read dbs many hiccups,btohqsg
DBS #1 to fk up GIRO with HSBC haha,btohqsg
I have received 15 000 MAX miles for my HSBC Revolution CC via SingSaver .. I thought it would be Krisflyer miles when I applied .. did anyone have similar experience? Or it‚Äôs a case of my poor memory,btohqsg

U can watch chris video on max miles,btohqsg
Hi everyone  which card that gives best cash back on Online travel transactions particularly Klook Trip.comandbooking.com?,btohqsg

If unauthorised  please call HSBC now.Does this suffice to mean that deduction will be done 3 days before my credit card due date with effect from 18th Oct 2024?,btohqsg
Would it be preferred to pair city reward with amaze for ride hailing or just city reward card directly will do? (Knowing that the cap for amaze is 1k and anything beyond that is chargeable),btohqsg
directly will do since it is online,btohqsg
Not really new  can also use overseas. üòÇAnd not ALL the restaurants. Only from the list ü´¢,btohqsg
hi guys  does anyone know what they mean by spend $588? do they mean by as long as we spend $588 on anything or only on their specific qualifying transaction categories? im currently thinking of getting a new phone and will be paying it online so will that transaction be counted?,btohqsg
Anything that qualify (normal exclusion on insurance  education etc). Would be a challenge to spend only on those specific categories to qualify,btohqsg
hmm t&c says ‚Äúon eligible transactions‚Äù so im a little confused as well,btohqsg
T&c gives a list of ineligible transactions.,btohqsg

Hi guys need help for starter  what basic card should i use for collecting miles? Spending more on daily usage like groceries food and stuff,btohqsg
Usually people do UOB PPV  UOB Ladies  Citi Rewards + Amaze. Also depends on how much u spend,btohqsg
Please be mindful that Citi Rewards Card (CRMC) blacklists Travel related transactions such as MCC 4121 for ride hailing. Whenever I takes Uber in USA  i manually switch my card paring to my other Mastercard (OCBC 90n) that give miles before booking a ride,btohqsg
I thought CRMC can use on 4121?,btohqsg
Hello! If I'm looking to pay my big purchase in installment should i use UOB preferred platinum or Citirewards with amaze?,btohqsg
Which company gives you the instalment? Bank  hotel  merchant?,btohqsg
I might be wrong. Amaze shows is travel related. Happy to be corrected,btohqsg
mcc 4121 is not travel related based on citi rewards tnC,btohqsg
doesn't matter since no points/miles for instalment,btohqsg
Would u be able to pay off the big purchase in 6 months time?,btohqsg
Wait. I check TnC and come back to u. U ok with cash rebates?,btohqsg
yup both miles or rebates are good,btohqsg
Once you get Instalment from bank  the mcc is no longer 5944 n likely not qualify for any miles.If you plan to buy watch or Jewelry  try charge to UOB KF in full n payonline.if you can meet SQ related $800 spend  get 3mpd else 1.2mpd.Other general card 1.2-1.4mpd should be ok for non-instalment.,btohqsg
nothing to do with mcc  instalment is excluded explicitly,btohqsg
is uob krisflyer debit card like the best to earn miles as for debit card,btohqsg
There should be something like this in your statement. This example for Citibank cc.,btohqsg
How abt posb passion debit card+yuu? assuming you can meet the minimum spend,btohqsg
mini spend $600 right? how does the yuu works?,btohqsg
https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/cards/bnpl-nxt-card.pageIf your (big) purchase amount for installments falls into the qualifying spend  can consider use this card and earn up to 1% cash rebates if your big purchase is >$6000,btohqsg

Hi  is there a way to use my DBS credit card to pay for my Mari Credit Card bill. Any info you can share would be greatly appreciated!,btohqsg
Aim is just to have a dedicated card for my insurance premium spendings.,btohqsg
So if the bill is 500  then annual fee waiver let say 200So u need to pay 500 first ? Or only pay for 300?,btohqsg
Ya I try by selecting phone option then cannotThen I don‚Äôt know how to become talk to customer serviceThen help me waived already,btohqsg
Then now my current statement vs bill statement got differences already,btohqsg
In this case  you pay $700 first.I‚Äôm assuming $500 is your statement bill and $200 is your annual fee.They will waive it in the next statement billing period  it will reflect on the Citibank app and in your latest transaction history,btohqsg
Pay according to your current statement balance  they will offset your 196.20 next statement,btohqsg
Unfortunately no‚Ä¶ you need to get confirmation from your bank which can take days to months. Also for DBS the confirmation must come before your statement is issued (unlike other banks).,btohqsg

Hi all for ocbc 360 account spending criteria  can i split the $500 spending across ocbc rewards and ocbc 365 card? Thanks,btohqsg
You can but why? Don't u need to hit 800 for ocbc 365 cc cashback,btohqsg
My spending with ocbc mainly online shopping. Planning to earn more miles thru rewards.Lazy to switch the telco and utility bills out to ocbc rewards.So wondering if it is to charge to both cards for aggregated $500 spending,btohqsg
But your teleco and utilities will only get 0.25% cashback if you don't hit 800 spend on ocbc 365 card,btohqsg

Hi all  I recently applied for the Trust cashback credit card  but my application was rejected. It's my first time applying for a credit card  and I haven't taken any loans either. My annual salary is well above 30 000 SGD  so I'm unsure why it was declined. Since Trust Bank didn‚Äôt provide a reason  does anyone have insights on what the issue might be?,btohqsg
Random guess. Do you have cc with standard chartered?,btohqsg
No  nothing with standard chartered. This is my first time applying for a credit card.,btohqsg
citi rewards vs ocbc rewards  which is better and why?,btohqsg
Was your assessable income in 2023 at least 30k?,btohqsg
Yeah  it is well above 30k,btohqsg
Depends on your spending  accounts you have  and your reward goal. Most will tell you CRMC is a must have as it's a great general spend miles card when paired with Amaze card.,btohqsg
i have the ocbc 360 account,btohqsg
Citi rewards is way better than ocbc rewards. Unless you are in miles game and want to clock ocbc 360 saving acct spend.,btohqsg
Just try applying again I guess.,btohqsg
My standard chartered cc got declined then within 1 month applied to trust Cashback card which got approved. üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Maybe you can ask them to decide on the limit first.,btohqsg
Before applied the card  i checked with their staff if purchased in app (icloud/apple pay)is determined to online shop or not. Staff say yes  that is count in online shop category. The first 10days  i checked that bill is really under online shop category  but after 1 week later  i login to Trust check again  the all icloud/apple pay changed to under Others category .,btohqsg
This is the case of cso doesn't know better. Their online shopping has specific mcc.,btohqsg
Then I contacted with their staff  they ask me to show them providence.,btohqsg
You didn't screenshot the chat with them? Risky move.,btohqsg

It do seem like 5732 transactions are not eligible under Shopping. You are better off appealing and asking. especially that you have proof that another CSO said it's valid.,btohqsg
Yes  i have send the screenshot to them  they just ignored it and keep saying they follow the MCC code.üò§,btohqsg
Then it's true  5732 is not eligible. That's why Challenger is also not eligible. They could be clearer in their t&cs tho.They placed the mcc list elsewhere:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/241552,btohqsg

I know Citi Prestige gives PP + 1 guest,btohqsg
If there is conflict of interest of coz staff will be excluded. Which is why i stated before using own company product have no conflict of interest,btohqsg
This is a promotion and not base product. Promotion can exclude staff participation if they think there is potential conflict of interest. What is individual bank consideration is not known to us also. Just like mall employee cant paricipate in their own mall promotion also,btohqsg
This is salary credit promo and does not the DBS Multiplier account itself lol.,btohqsg
Not keen to argue further. But my point is rather than assume employees won‚Äôt be excluded  be it base product or promotions  it‚Äôs safest just to refer to the actual T&C.Will just leave it at that.,btohqsg
If u see most tnc  it is promotion campaign that usually exclude staff and not the usual base product. Some promotion even exclude family of staff as there could be conflict of interest. My key word is conflict of interest.,btohqsg

Also for big ticket items since its uncap.I also understand that 90N can choose miles or cashback  albeit at a lower rate of 1.2 vs infinity's 1.6.Also  if 90N  is it recommended for visa or master? Normally I'll auto pick master for cardup  but most of my current cards are master  wonder if I should pick visa to balance things out (e.g. For certain countries where master less accepted)Would love to hear some insights or perspectives to help me consider between the two  in case I missed anything. Ty!,btohqsg
Damn  long wall of text haha...,btohqsg
thought visa has better promo code for cardup?,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Ah I could've read wrongly (was ipaymy)   ignore that point then!,btohqsg
Us Esta payment (mcc 9399) should work with Uob absolute Amex right?,btohqsg
But I guess don‚Äôt make sense to incur the 4% Cost.Might as well use YouTrip with zero rewards but small fx cost.,btohqsg
Is Klook considered as travel related?,btohqsg
Most of the time yes. Which card are you looking at?,btohqsg
Don't use it for klook haha,btohqsg
Buy Klook vouchers on heymax insteadüòÇ,btohqsg
Take note you have to load up the vouchers in your profile (usually by the site)  not directly in the Klook booking,btohqsg
Both interest and cashback also no come ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
üò∞ should be soon?Both me & wife account all get liao.,btohqsg
I only got EGA bonus for jul/Aug  still no cashback for giro since 11 oct,btohqsg
Weird the GIRO 1% I always get it the next working day.,btohqsg
You got the 1% cashback from recent giro after 10 Oct?  I just checked and still don‚Äôt have ü•≤,btohqsg
Yeah  still no 1% for me  but then again the 'wrong' amount credited earlier this month is still way more than what is owed to me... so still net positive ü§£,btohqsg
I just checked earlier. I was told that their cashback system is facing some issues,btohqsg
I‚Äôm in negative territory despite the ‚Äúaccidentals‚Äùcos many giro went through‚Ä¶lol not gd,btohqsg
My GIRO only deducts 24th/25th monthly  will know soon. üòÖ,btohqsg
I asked the HsBC cso why the 1% cashback is not in and s/he said usually it needs 14 business days. Obviously that‚Äôs a template answer coz i always got it a day after money is withdrawn! üòí,btohqsg
Yes. Last time I also kenna 1 time is almost 10 days then they credit.,btohqsg
When was this? Last month? Mine stopped on oct 10. If it is really their system having issue  now i start wondering if the bonus interest they give is actually calculated correctly or not.,btohqsg
Quite long ago. Maybe half a year ago.Yeah. I also feel like they never calculate correctly. üòÖAlso the RM last time told us to double check also  if not correct can tell them.That‚Äôs what made me scared lol.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm just sian if they stop the giro 1% cash back. But they should announce on website if they intend to stop right?Could be technical issues,btohqsg
"Should be..If not ""enough""  then tell them",btohqsg
Frankly I tried tracking before and gave up. The amounts are not aligned by giro payments. Sometimes they lump sum etc,btohqsg
I also havent receive the interest üò≠nv receive giro cashback also since 8oct...,btohqsg
"Their ""everyday"" rewards not coming in everyday liao üòÇ",btohqsg
Interest got chance. I just received July August bonus.The giro cash back no sound since 10 October for me,btohqsg
Hi  may I know which credit card are the best to pay for MCC 7011  7012 and 3501 to 3999,btohqsg
Still eager to know whether enforcement of the new July clause of HSBC EGA is done...https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/215497,btohqsg
Just wondering if it was enforced... i also duno how to affirm,btohqsg
Remember there were huge discussion back in July when the clause was added? üòÖ,btohqsg
This is not about giro right?,btohqsg
Oh gosh  such a big bank but with lousy system. The 1% cashback from giro is still easy to calculate but not the ega interest üòì,btohqsg
my own experience thus far is NO..and that time i already pointed out it is impossible to enforce unless your account does NOTHING except just park money..no transaction no salary no payments,btohqsg
Nope  not giro. Its about the 30day fresh fund thingie.,btohqsg
singtel kiosk can pay what bill?,btohqsg
This month's bonus interest is supposedly the first time this clause is being tested,btohqsg
I tried before and gave up. Impossible lol.Last time they said can see from statement what is the MAB  but then later said only the RM can see. So if you want  must keep calling them to check what is your MAB for that month.,btohqsg
Means still a long wait‚Ä¶ üòÇ,btohqsg
just use excel to ownself track loh.. mine usually accurate to plus/minus few dollars,btohqsg
Not worth the time. üòÇWill just trust HSBC for now. üòÇThat extra 1% should more than offset.,btohqsg
mine is byproduct of doing cash management so no extra effort.so far hsbc quite accurate and honourable.,btohqsg

Need to put fixed deposit in the bank. Which card are you interested?,btohqsg
Just any basic card will do  mainly for groceries and dining  thanks.,btohqsg
I found the Best Credit Card for Beginners: Mari Credit Cardhttps://youtu.be/jlWcWHOl5bU,btohqsg
For UOB Paynow SALA from personal bank accounts trick will no longer work? This is the T&C,btohqsg
Its promotion. Self credit doesnt work for promotion.,btohqsg
This is not UOB One account t&c.,btohqsg
Not sure if this is shared. GXS 4.3% will have a confirmation email if you onboard.,btohqsg
do you have the link i can‚Äôt seem to find this page,btohqsg
No point finding the link anymore. The last day to onboard was ytd,btohqsg
This is an email I just received. As for how I sign up  I forgotten already. Probably log in GXS and create boast account and put money in,btohqsg
eveyrone got it already ? asking cos I don't seem to have it,btohqsg
Possibly it is Bonus interest for the saving ?,btohqsg
2 misconceptions i just read:1. UOB salary promo criteria is not the same as UOB One bonus interest criteria.2. the HSBC bonus interest credited today is not the HSBC 1% GIRO benefit,btohqsg
Yes. Seems like all my friends got it liao.,btohqsg
weird.. I found it in Sep last month for July. means I got it a mth earlier?,btohqsg
those looking to sign up for this - beware if your voucher usage triggers their apparently ‚Äúvery sensitive‚Äù security system  your shopee account will be permanently banned and all ur 5% cashback awarded in shopee coins are basically forfeited :),btohqsg
Could your promo be for Jun/July?And ours for July/Aug?,btohqsg
For SCB giro it seems even if you have a refund into the account way before due date   the giro still deduct full amount of statement date due  anyone has similar experience?,btohqsg
Hi all  I applied for AMEX TC via singsaver here.. was supposed to have the $150 cash paynow. I emailed singsaver 3 times follow up no response.. what should I do?,btohqsg
Giro deductions are automated. The amount for the Giro month is predetermined and submitted for processing days before deduction date. I experienced before  which is why i don't pay card bills by giro. U can try ask bank to credit u back the excess amount paid to your bank account with them,btohqsg
For other banks  any credits in time will be offset  thus thinking if SCB is different,btohqsg
Citibank is like scb as well. They will deduct whole amt on statement even if prepaid some before due date,btohqsg
anyone have any good ideas how to use $700 on 5812 or 5814 stored value.. like starbucks this type (but i don't want $700 into starbucks!!)thanks!,btohqsg
Unless u keep helping colleague to tabao their starbuck or to pay first for company event but to be honest 700 on dining at one merchant is very hard to ultilise,btohqsg
if only breadtalk card is 5812 or 5814 i can finish $700 in 2-3 months..but it is grocery sigh..you know any other dining stored value cards?,btohqsg
suggestions so far:1. starbucks2. xiangxiang hunan,btohqsg
Why u have to die die buy 700 lol,btohqsg
trust cashback 15%! this is my 3rd month,btohqsg
Xiangxiang hunan is bomb  highly recommend,btohqsg
This is consider force spending in my opinion loh haha,btohqsg
if buy stored value still ok i guess.. but must be on stores that i will usually go (so not really forced but pay it forward),btohqsg
forced spending is like those credit card vouchers.. give you $100 vouchers at restaurants that u usually don't go.. and you force yourself to go and eat there just to use the voucher (and pay more than the voucher value),btohqsg
Then u list down store that u really do loh. To be honest i think effective rate of trust cashback is not that high as calculated by fintech youtuber. I am a fan if maybank fnf even more since it include 5814 now,btohqsg
4.9% blended loh... it is good because i use the 1% to pay health hub,btohqsg
Healthhub can get better cashback using other better card haha,btohqsg
Hi thanks.Just this 2 banks from knowledge?,btohqsg
i don't have those cards.. and not enough.. i only CRMC $1k only,btohqsg
If i did not rmb wrong i think it is less than 4.9 percent based on others calculation due to the cap cashback on the 15 percent reward,btohqsg
$1667 x 15% = $250.05$4333 x 1% = $43.33Total = 293.38 / 6000 = 4.89%,btohqsg
i am extremely worried about this.. for people like us who play musical chairs.. will kenna money held for 24 hours or notSINGAPORE ‚Äì Banks must block or hold for 24 hours suspicious transactions involving more than $25 000.This move must be part of banks‚Äô real-time fraud surveillance to substantially reduce cases of customers having large sums of money rapidly drained from their accounts without their knowledge  the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced on Oct 24.An account is considered to be rapidly drained if more than half of a balance of at least $50 000 is transferred out cumulatively over a day.,btohqsg
Forgot to include other spend cashback. But u can always apply for other card that suit your spending habit better,btohqsg
Wow jia lat  should we do citi payall below 25k üò±,btohqsg
better NOT be JUST IN TIME WARRIOR liao...,btohqsg
what do u mean other spend cashback?,btohqsg
Seems like questions will be asked.,btohqsg
it is not the questions asked thing..if you moving out $200k from Account A on 31st January 8pm  it might be blocked for 24 hours,btohqsg
I only counted the 15 percent bonus cashback and left out the 1 percent other spending,btohqsg
Isnt citipayall on your citibank cc?,btohqsg
May I know which bank ? Thanks,btohqsg
Healthhub is eligible spending for lot of card.,btohqsg
Last time I used live  now use amexCan share what other cashback cards?,btohqsg
If they hold it they may start poking arnd and ask qns also,btohqsg
nothing wrong with merry-go-round strategy right,btohqsg
btw anyone withdrawing chocolate interest daily to DBS and every day get sent one letter...a bit annoying and also the amount of paper waste and postage costs,btohqsg
We know it‚Äôs ok. The banks won‚Äôt know. Sure kenna flag out one. Sheet.,btohqsg
no lah just justify to them. It's the MS that's more scary,btohqsg
The base cashback card range from 1.5-1.7 without minimum spend. If u can hit minimum spend of other cashback card u can get from 3.33 to 5 percent,btohqsg
I keep 19980  withdraw every 8 to 9 day. Same 2.30 per day,btohqsg
Unless transfer from own bank to another same name if not high chance tio due dilligence. Even spouse name will tio cause consider third party unless u prove relationship loh. I kena for uob and hsbc,btohqsg
I believe some people were banned from local banks doing this if i recall,btohqsg
Coz they abuse the cut off time of bank,btohqsg
Hi one question  if i were to open the uob lady account and deposit $10K today  tmr onwards if i use the lady card for dining etc  i will get the bonus miles from 4 miles to 6miles per $1 ? Is this how it works.,btohqsg
I asked u which card you are interested then you put fixed deposit with that bank lor,btohqsg
Yes  but usually what ppl do is open on last few day do 1 shot 100k mab then get up to 10mpd then drop to 10k mab the next month,btohqsg
Hi can ask what is the better investment for CPF OA?,btohqsg
Yeah I only do same name to same name.Must see how they program. If they follow the rule as stated in newspaper.$25k or more than half the balance of the account. Sure will kenna when rotate bank balances for bonus interest.,btohqsg
Sure will affect merry go around due to transfer limit,btohqsg
This month end I will move out a few days earlier. Just to be safe,btohqsg
Just answer truthfully when you get a friendly call from the bank. That is what I did when Trust bank folks called me,btohqsg
The friendly call is ok.What is not ok when u transfer out at 9pm then kenna blocked and they call u back the next day,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows if bookingtrip.comthrough Heymax net me the 5 MPD w altitude?,btohqsg

My bank account was not blocked. But when I started using trust card in China  the card got blocked. They tot these are fraudulent transaction by the fact it is from China and it is quite a few being performed.,btohqsg
It may all change from 24th October as purported by newspaper article.This was spelt out under the finalised Shared Responsibility Framework (SRF) for phishing scams  unveiled on Oct 24.Banks have six months from Dec 16  the date the SRF kicks in  to implement the new measure.,btohqsg
I dont do musical chairs for my UOB and DBS. But Trust folks may call cos I use it as holding account to earn good interest while waiting for opportunities. 3.5% up to 800k. I can hold a lot of cash inside for standby,btohqsg
Trust bank can earn 3.5% interest?,btohqsg
I fulfill all their criteria. I salary credit and always use trust card for FairPrice shopping as NTUC member. Also I always keep 100k above,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/iiJ4kXYDRGwTry this. Look at invest section.,btohqsg
Hi I saw mari cc got 2% foreign currency charge and 1% currency conversion fee then the 3% cash back on foreign spending useless,btohqsg
Better with trust cashback card i think,btohqsg
"If I calculateMari cc = (-2%)+(-1%)+3.25% = 0.25%Trust Cashback = (-0.3%)+(1%) = 0.7%Based on my calculation trust is better.Let me know if my calculation is not correctI didn't take trust cashback ""15%"" cos I don't think I spend enough to get that.",btohqsg
mari cc also have exchange gap ah,btohqsg
isn't it in the 3% already?,btohqsg
3% fees then there is exchange rate. Anyway clearly Trust cashback is better,btohqsg
Ok thanks.  Updated the new calculation for reference.Mari cc = +(-0.3%)+(-2%)+(-1%)+3.25% = -0.05%Trust Cashback = (-0.3%)+(1%) = 0.7%,btohqsg
https://www.maribank.sg/fees-rates/mari-credit-cardOk upon further studying the Section B Foreign Currency Transactions NOTEMari cc = +(-0.3%)+(-2%)+(-1%)+3% = -0.3%Trust Cashback = (-0.3%)+(1%) = 0.7%,btohqsg

Hi  can I ask if I link my instarem amaze card to Alipay and citi rewards. Do I get 4mpd when spending in China when using alipay to make payment?,btohqsg

Welcome to ocbc premier voyage ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•,btohqsg
Are you aware that travel expenses are not included under citi rewards,btohqsg
How do you even cap that full 2k though üò±,btohqsg
Bro  once you hit a certain age with family and mortgage  sure cap haha,btohqsg
ü•≤ I forgot about the family and mortgage portion...Now i regret asking üòÇ,btohqsg
It is nice before expenses start to takeover your life and you‚Äôre doing financial planning already!Very commendable.,btohqsg
Hi will dbs altitude card earn points for healthhub? Thanks,btohqsg
why those company like lock your money one will always have decreasing interest rates? Example 3 months 3% then 6 months 2.8% 12 months 2.5% returns. So is this more worth to put 3 months or more? Knowing interest rate might change be it increase or decrease after i lock  what option would you choose?,btohqsg
Maybe they expect interest rates to drop in the longer term?,btohqsg
Mhmm  so if it was you which would you choose? Take higher interest rate for shorter term or lower interest rate for longer term? Assuming this is money you do not need urgently.,btohqsg
Do you expect interest rates to drop further? And to what extent? To me a 0.5 drop within 12 months is quite a lotBanks have more data than us and better skilled people to predict  general assumption though üòÇBest is you hedge a bet before any announcements of interest rate drops before banks can react. Then you win a little.If not just play with those high interest savings account.In the end  I feel it‚Äôs just a small proportion of the overall sum to worry too much over it. You win some you lose some.,btohqsg
for credit card bills payment  am I right to say that we need to use AXS to pay our bills? cos I can't seem to find any button in their apps for payment. Citi rewards card n HSBC revo card. also  there is no payment for Amazed card right? cos from my understanding  it links to my Citi rewards card.,btohqsg
Read credit card statements  there should have some instructions printed on the statement on how to pay the bills.,btohqsg
I closed my UOB lady‚Äôs card in 2020 and until now the UOB wont let me approve my application for the card. Anyone knows why?,btohqsg
maybe u open and close many UOB cards just for the benefits and don't spend with it,btohqsg
Why use a base rate card lol. 4mpd card like dbs wwmc and citi reward should work,btohqsg

One of my humans is actually loss $30 if inclusive dividend. Then add $80 voucher only gain $50.,btohqsg
I am not too sure what you mean.,btohqsg
üòÆ. I only participate few months ago. If plus vouchers  return is about 4.5% pa.,btohqsg
Might as well just HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
Not p.a? Have u sold investment liao?,btohqsg
Not yet sell  still holding it. If not calculate per annum  then average 0.375% per month depending on how many months you have bought the fund. I think I bought at the right timing. I did not participate last year promo. Only participated few months ago.,btohqsg
Hi guys  need some help  I am currently still short of $200 to clock the min. Spend for HSBC live for this monthCurrently I am overseas now  did not bring the physical card along and also never activate the overseas usage.Is there recommendations to clock the $200 spend online?,btohqsg
Never activate can consider hitting requirement? Some banks no activate dont count,btohqsg
I think OP says he did not activate oversea usage n can use in SG only.,btohqsg
I dont see any option to activate overseas usage though,btohqsg
I just tap with google pay when overseas  transaction went through,btohqsg
Not sure is buying voucher via Heymax qualify?,btohqsg
I never had to call hsbc bank to activate overseas usage.,btohqsg
The only bank that blocks overseas possibly first time use is UOB,btohqsg
Anyone heard of Big Tiny investment ?,btohqsg
Not sure leh  I think hsbc need to call in to activate the overseas,btohqsg
Does scoot earn 4mpd for hsbc revolution ?,btohqsg
Yes   apparently they are offering 8-10% ROI,btohqsg
So I was wondering anyone tried before,btohqsg
Usually this kind of small sized investment platform it is very risky. I won‚Äôt want to call it a scam because I have no evidence. But usually this kind the founder is enriched by investors regardless of the actual performance.,btohqsg

If he had gone to actual banks to seek financing. Either he will get rejected or the rates charged are way above the 8-10% pa mentioned/projected.,btohqsg
8-10% is too low for the amount of risk to take. I would expect at least 30%-50%,btohqsg

Still havent received EGA bonus interest. Anyone same? (Yup i have been yapping for few days already.. ),btohqsg
I got July-Aug. I think it‚Äôs July promo,btohqsg
Ok! My stupid mistake! The interest is actually in  but is in human B acct on 24th. 2nd time receiving this EGA bonus  didnt realise it is to be received alternate between the 2 accts every month! üò≥,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
So jul aug ega bonus interest was in only on 24 Oct ?,btohqsg
So far only heard this date from thise who received,btohqsg
So Sep Oct ega bonus interest will only be in end Dec? Any hsbc ega experts here can confirm ?!,btohqsg
Look at the tnc for your promo. Safest,btohqsg
if i want to get 6mpd for lady solitaire card spending charged in Nov with 10k saving in lady savings  should i start transferring over to lady savings starting 1 Nov to keep MAB at 10k? it is based off nov MAB not oct right?,btohqsg
Bonus for the month is based on mab for the same month,btohqsg
Transaction Posted month shall be same as MAB month  not charged month.,btohqsg

Hi friends  i just saw that some of my instarem points are expiring - what is the best way to spend them?,btohqsg
100 expiring but i have 1.1k points at the moment,btohqsg
If your 1k still have many months. Suggest to keep until 2k to redeem 20 dollars. 100 will need to forgo,btohqsg
Because 1k pts for 5 dollars is not worth it,btohqsg
How to check if the promo from singsaver for applying citireward is approved?My card is approved and sending to me already,btohqsg

Really depends on merchant posting speed. But sat is probably not too risky,btohqsg
Generally speaking is ok as it‚Äôs 3 days to 31st,btohqsg
Hiiii.How do I make payment using DBS WWC to earn points? Is it entering the card details or Apple Pay will do? üôèüèª,btohqsg
To earn 4mpd on DBS WWMC  transaction must be online..Apple Pay will work if it's in-app spend  cannot tap..,btohqsg

Good morning  wondering whether has anyone considered investing in s&p500 via unit trust instead of ETF?For example:dca into Endowus unit trust ishare us index fund s&p500 instead of voo / cspx / spylCalculationsIshare us index fund s&p 500 expense ratio (ER) 0.05 + Endowus platform fee 0.3 = 0.35% pa (no dividends hence no dwt)Voo ER 0.03% + dwt 30% x 1.3% = 0.43%Cspx ER 0.07% + dwt 15% x 1.3% = 0.27%But don‚Äôt forget for voo and cspx you need to pay transaction fees to buy and also you get exposure to usd and forex spread  voo got estate tax whereas Endowus is denominated in SGD,btohqsg
May I know which is the most recommended place to dca CSPX? (SGD 100/mth),btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs Ireland domiciled and listed on LSE so you don‚Äôt have that many options - ibkr poems Saxo fsmone ‚Ä¶Wah if you only gonna do 100 per month then not worth it. The best is ibkr but there is usd 2 fx conversion fee and usd 1.7 transaction fee. Even if you enable recurring payment you still need to pay 1.7 usd,btohqsg
Good morning Sifu's.ü´∏ü´∑Has anyone got problem with receiving 1% Everyday+ cashback from hsbc ega account? I got my last cashback on 9/10/24 and till now I dont get any despite I have credit card spent and giro payments.,btohqsg

Hi  looking to get 0% installment plans from gain city etc.. and deciding btw OCBC titanium or dbs altitude..1) if I'm using dbs altitude for the 0% installment will it earn miles?2) if I'm using OCBC titanium rewards card will it the installment per month amount be count as part of the OCBC $500 credit card spending/month requirement for extra interest gain?3) what cards would u recommend for bulk buys?,btohqsg
So then does it count under your monthly $500 spending requirement to earn extra interest rate for OCBC?,btohqsg
Hi guys can i check if i have a purchase viaTrip.comof about 7k  what cards should i use to maximise the miles ah? Can i just use DBS vantage for the payment to get 1.5 mpd?,btohqsg
I can't spilt the payment as i will be staying in a hotel for 7 nights,btohqsg
Ocbc 360? Dont think so. In general  installment ipp are not eligible for minimum spending cuz u r splitting the bill anyway,btohqsg
If its not under any promo and must book today  I'd do 2k on dbs altitude  1.5 on wwmc  2k on uob lady solitaire and rest on whatever card if any balance left.Meaning i will do split bookings  2-3 nights on each cards.,btohqsg
I cant spilt hahaha cuz my other cards like WWMC  Altitude  UOB and HSBC all maxed out for this month le,btohqsg
And its a pretty last minute trip so i dony have any other general card except Vantage :(,btohqsg
Who say cant spilt lol. Spilt the hotel night,btohqsg
He meant the rest of the cards are max out liao  so cant split,btohqsg
I've maxed out my other cards le,btohqsg
There is also synthetic s&p500 ETF like I500 which you can buy onhmsg.link/ibkr,btohqsg
I think u have no choice but to put on vantage,btohqsg
And because the 7 nights is on peak period that overlaps Christmas and new years :(,btohqsg
Its okay la  sometimes no choice. Think of it this way  u still get something hahhahaha.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a unit trust so no buy sell spread. Asset under management is 3 billion sgd. the catch is that it is synthetic.,btohqsg
Sir Chris  what‚Äôs your own practice? Do you invest in s p 500  if so how ?,btohqsg

FSM rsp s&p no fee the best.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p2xcLEMlhxs,btohqsg

How is their reward being given? Didn't see any cash coming in... Moomoo,btohqsg
