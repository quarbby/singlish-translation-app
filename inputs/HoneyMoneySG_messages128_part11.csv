The bonus 9x you can earn every statement month on CRMC is capped at 9000. Assuming you spend 1000 on eligible transactions  you get bonus 9000 thank you points. If you spend 500 on travel  there’s no bonus 9x for that. Means you still can spend 1k on stuff that’s eligible for the 9x. In conclusion  yes the $500 is not counted toward the $1k cap.,btohqsg
Most importantly dont accidentally pay with wrong card. I feel heart pain 😢,btohqsg
intend to pay by UOB Lady + Amaze  but do not change the link card to UOB Lady  I feel the pain once the charged notification come from CRMC.,btohqsg
At least not the other way round as crmc is black list. I charged a few grab trips to UOB lady dining 😅,btohqsg
Lesson learned  next time will be more caution on this.Thanks everyone for the sharing.,btohqsg
Hi! Can I ask  I have a 2k+ spending on Agoda  which is the best miles card for this? I currently have UOB privimiles  UOB ladys and Citi rewards to accumulate miles. Any other cards to recommend? Appreciate it!,btohqsg
Hi all  can I ask if my OCBC 360 monthly balance compare to last month is 80K only (as per portal) I can’t be getting 4.05% right? Should I top up another 20K to make it 100K. I have salary credited and spend $500 this month. Tq in advance,btohqsg
Can consider apply dbs alititude card now year end got 5mpd promo (cap at 2k spending) but need to join the promo in paylah.,btohqsg
Ooh let me check that out. Thank you queenie!,btohqsg
Where to find that promo? I have but not using it actively cuz low earn rate,btohqsg
Dbs altitude can get 5 mpd plus dbs discount,btohqsg
But UOB points pool  might be easier to redeem a ticket. The DBS discount is tempting tho.,btohqsg
So i will spilt booking as usual. Extra 2mpd u cant justify 18 percent discount,btohqsg
Wow! Thanks just read it. But a question  does it qualify if i pay for hotel at the desk using dbs altitude card there physically?,btohqsg
Dbs also pool in a certain sense altitude point no expiry. Only online travel,btohqsg
Need to join promo then spend. If not no 5mpd. Sep oct is 5mpd for online travel. Nov dec is 5mpd for fcy spending cap at 2k. Need to rejoin promo each month. Minimum spending is 1k,btohqsg

Guys i am abit confused on the UOB SALA payment to trigger the salary bonus if i am paying myself  how do i paynow to myself? Do i just choose paynow from DBS / OCBC and type SALA PAYNOW SALA in description to make it work? Or do i use fast transfer and put category salary with comment SALA PAYNOW SALA?,btohqsg
Try dbs FAST transfer. Can select purpose.,btohqsg

Hi! I have a question about eligible transactions to earn miles.I have a citibank rewards credit card  paired with the Instarem Amaze card.I am going for a dental appointment but I am not sure if it's considered as an eligible transaction for my 4mpd. Does anyone have any experience paying for dental appointments with credit cards?Thank you!,btohqsg
Private dental clinics not under a hospital should give 4mpd. Can always test with Amaze first to check MCC.,btohqsg
For me  it shows up in my PayLah,btohqsg
Snack insurance May promotion capitaland voucher is here,btohqsg
May I ask if anyone has experience dealing with unauthorised credit card dispute with HSBC?Few days ago  I received sms notif that there was a suspicious transaction on my HSBC Live+ card - about 180 SGD over 2 transactions on Ubereats UK. Transaction was made in GBP.  I immediately blocked the card  then called up HSBC hotline. CSO also did a manual block just in case. He then told me the transaction likely cleared and I need to wait for it to change from pending status to cleared status to file a dispute formdispute form forces me to declare and agree to pay to a $5 retrieval fee? otherwise the form can't be submittedand this is on HSBC webpage:While we will do our best to resolve your dispute  the investigation progress is subject to the merchant's cooperation. It can take between 2 to 6 months upon receipt of your dispute form for the dispute to be resolveddo they really take that long? my card has never left my house. scb/citi reverses such fraud transactions automatically,btohqsg
