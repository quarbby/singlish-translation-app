i should be able to fufil the 12 weeks anyway,btohqsg
just not according to their mandated dates,btohqsg
yeah they said it's ok when it first push back but because it's for module credits need to write report and nonsense,btohqsg
dunno whether can meet the report deadlines like that,btohqsg
but annoying to think about lol,btohqsg
ppl who were on exchange this sem also F,btohqsg
People who were meant to go to HK  then replacement exchange this Sem double F,btohqsg
I know somebody Sem 1 supposed to be in HK then Extradition Law happened,btohqsg
Then this Sem go somewhere  then COVID recall,btohqsg
Ah ok i seen ur sch chem notes before  understandable why,btohqsg

Dammit John now you missed the game,btohqsg
Four who tested positive have died from other causesSince when did that number rise from 2 to 4,btohqsg

hi how come I connect my phone to laptop via USB cable I cannot find my phone in device manager although my phone is charging,btohqsg

idk I just bought the Silvertec wire about one month ago,btohqsg
I only trust one brand HAHAHA,btohqsg
the only reason why I had to throw an Anker wire away was because I don't need it anymore aka micro usb,btohqsg
I mean you are loyal to the milo brand,btohqsg

Note 10+ is the real deal,btohqsg
my last samsung phone was s3,btohqsg

still remember when that was super desirable,btohqsg
Currently using xiaomi pb as well,btohqsg
htc wildfire s -> note 2 -> oppo find 7a -> htc 10 -> note 9,btohqsg
during my time  Sony Ericsson was the OG,btohqsg
followed by the Motorola flip phone,btohqsg
"tbh i regard xiaomi pb as like the ""anker knockoff""",btohqsg
still p damn good  but just not as good as anker,btohqsg
idt that was even a smartphone,btohqsg
damn compare gingerbread to android 10 now,btohqsg
i remember ricing my s3 using nexus launcher back in 2013,btohqsg

Barber isn't really a gender neutral term I think,btohqsg
Eh whatever la LOL now is all same,btohqsg
Nobody is gonna see your hair,btohqsg
Then it's OK if you can see it,btohqsg
If barbershops don't reopen in May,btohqsg

Haha look at Nobel prizes. Oops forgot Japan  India and USSR/Russia üëå,btohqsg

"It is like saying""I'm in ri/hci  I'm not doomed to score below 75rp""",btohqsg
Higher chances la. Angmo are more thorough and innovative I guess,btohqsg
Japanese also but I think fair chance. And isnt it oxford???,btohqsg

we asians only know how to plant rice üò™,btohqsg
Asians more applications based. Good at copying I guess and making small improvements,btohqsg
Exception of Japs. Every year make invention and discoveries. I will be interested to know (if any) an Asian version  of Albert Einstein  Euler  Linus Pauling  Bohr (father and son)  Watson and crick  Laplace  Rosalind Franklin etcü§£,btohqsg
Theres a higher incentive to try new things out in western world,btohqsg
While in asian societies u have a lot to lose if u dont perform,btohqsg
Gives u higher incentive to rinse and repeat shit,btohqsg
Yes providing slight improvements to theories... publish small papers... may have many citations but not revolutionary.,btohqsg
But we can see how asians are good at implementation like SG healthcare system,btohqsg
