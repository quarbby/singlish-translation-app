Gd morning  anyone here have savings w TRUST? I'm curious to open one to know is it safe. Thx,btohqsg
Trust owned by SCB and NTUC Fairprice and insured under SDIC up to $75K,btohqsg
Is it worth to transfer shares from moomoo to webull to get the rewards?,btohqsg
Mmf rate now 3.7% +/-Share price volatile.Where else to park $?ü§î,btohqsg
Also your bank deposit is SDIC insured until 75k,btohqsg
Oh yeah I was curious why 20th haven't come in. The final round they really postpone until I got it today,btohqsg
I put 100k and joined the exclusive Trust+ Gold Club.,btohqsg
what‚Äôs the perks for gold club beside getting the 3% interest?,btohqsg
nothing much. eg.special hotel rates and 1for1 GV gold clas.,btohqsg
most important is the 3% and to show off the heavy gold card to waiter  waitress and cashier lor.,btohqsg
but the heavy metal gold card not released yet.,btohqsg
You could also consider getting UOB VS to one-shot the 2k,btohqsg
oops i read wrong yeah if working money contribution  still go to sa even if frs already,btohqsg
Hi Guys  what is the best high interest bank acc in the market except moomoo? Bonus saver?,btohqsg
Just to be clear  make sure you‚Äôre not confusing bank accounts and money market funds. Moomoo is the latter,btohqsg
Sorry  noted. I need instant withdrawal that's why I am looking for bank acc. Any bank accs?,btohqsg
Honey money has plenty of youtube videos on this  should go there first if you haven‚Äôt,btohqsg
You want instant withdrawal and still see daily interest  then only Mari 2.88% and GXS 2.68%,btohqsg
Mari with Mari Invest. Up to 10K for instant redemption and withdrawal.,btohqsg
Hi  may I know for the GV gold class 1 for 1  is there any conditions? E.g. One time use one? Only can be used for weekend? I tried to ask Trust CSO  they said I will know when I qualify for the account..,btohqsg
one time use per month and first 100 redemption only.,btohqsg
anyway if want better interest make sure you use trust only if have spare funds and already put in 100k in UOB and 100k in ocbc and already also diversified to other instruments like t-bills which can get more than 3%.,btohqsg
For uob one account  if I withdraw my 100k away by end of the month to wait for the quarterly bonus campaign  would it means that this month there wouldn't be any interest? Or the interest is calculated daily?,btohqsg
interest is based on monthly average balance in the month  can topup your balance earlier in the month to make up to still get $100k monthly average balance. Btw need to withdraw by 30 Mar before 10.30pm since 31 Mar is Sunday and any transfer will be dated next business day on 1 Apr.,btohqsg
I think some mentioned to transfer before 29th to be safer  as PH followed by sat and sun  your money may not transfer out in time,btohqsg
Keep take note that this quarterly promotion from UOB is not guaranteed. So if it doesn‚Äôt happen  you lose about 4 days of interest 29-31th. Know the potential gains and losses.,btohqsg
High level method is to bump 1-27th March balance to about $114k. Then withdraw on 28th to $10. Adb should be $100 0xx. Do your own calculations. I‚Äôm stating off back of my head.This method whether uob had new promo or no. U get max interest for March still.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  may I know how do u transfer a big lump sum of money out and reinstate again after a few days  like this above example? I understand that for FAST transfer  there is a limit to it. Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Hi all experts  for OCBC 360 account   my salary was credited yesterday and I just notice today. Understand that for OCBC 360  we cant have lower amount compare to yesterday. If I withdraw out my salary today  does my interest will be forfeit?,btohqsg
If you plan correctly there won't be losses,btohqsg
Anyone tried to use Esso PHV card with Krispay as payment? Do they allow?,btohqsg
You can increase daily transfer limit just for this  then decrease back to normal after done,btohqsg
You can withdraw today  count the adb using excel file to make sure it is 500+ then last month,btohqsg
