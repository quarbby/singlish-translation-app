For money market funds like tiger vault and webull moneybull   are there ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or ‚Äúworse‚Äù days to top up ? Eg days where the US bond price drops,btohqsg

your average daily balance for the month will be lower than $100k. For example if put back 1 day later in a month with 30 days  average daily balance 29√ó$100k/30 = $96666.67. You lose 7.8%√ó3333.33√ó30/365= $21.37 of interest,btohqsg
