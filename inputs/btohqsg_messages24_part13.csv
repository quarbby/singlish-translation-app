Noted thanks for the info ;),btohqsg
Any idea when Tampines June bto result will be out?,btohqsg

Is it canberra  Dr. ready  then this  coming 25th August  have road show?,btohqsg
Not yet.  Just road show only,btohqsg
are u asking whether there is rs for canberra drive bto this coming 25th aug? usually the first key collection will commence ard 2-3 months after e rs. just a guideline tho..,btohqsg
The final confirmation answer  is still hdb.,btohqsg
If you can't find  ask your HRNot sure what impact you are referring toThe amount or HDB taking much longer to approve your HFEHDB might still end up asking you for the June & July '23 payslips,btohqsg
They have justification for rejecting your application since you did not provide the required documents,btohqsg
If you are looking at EHG  suggest you provide the 12 months payslips that HDB has asked forIf you are looking at HDB loan  it is not a must to furnish 12 months payslip but you must be employed at the point of application  as well as when loan is disbursedIf you must use August '23 - July' 24 payslips  then apply for HFE in SeptemberBut no guarantee whether it will be approved before October BTO launchThere are people who shared that their HFE was approved quite quickly but there are also those who had waited for months,btohqsg
I submitted 1 different month & they still asked me to submit the exact same as they stated.,btohqsg
They asked to submit the additional documents for my application & it got approved in 2-3 days upon submitting,btohqsg
Is yours HFE?How long was it after your application that HDB asked you to submit the correct documents?,btohqsg
Thanks!For my EHG application in the past  it was almost 12 months before i received an email from HDB  asking for additional documents üòÇüòÇHad submitted 12 months payslips previously but yeah  my 12th month is not their 12th month,btohqsg
Yah... But since flat selection was done  just chill and waitNot in a hurry to give away my CPF$$Was mainly uncertain about the grant amount as there was change in monthly income during that 12-month periodPresumably HFE should be more efficient now by assessing both grant and loan concurrently,btohqsg
Yah  heard some HFE are approved very fastNot sure what happened to those that are taking months,btohqsg
Sorry  not really understanding... Is HLE or HFE easier?,btohqsg
Was thinking - if wrong documents submitted for HFE  should be not that difficult to ask for correct ones to be submitted soonerUnless the documents totally not touched yet and haven't discover wrong...,btohqsg
This is meThat was why cannot understand just now üòÇ,btohqsg
Understand in Aug  you will be given ballot queue number.My niece's Feb bto  her number allocated was quite to the front  she just got her unit chosen in mid-july  about 5months from submission of bto application.So for Jun bto   if you are give a queue number  i guess for selection of unit may be around dec or Jan 25 before the new launch of bto in feb 2025.,btohqsg
The selection of flat timing will depend on the queue number tbh.Plus when they start selection is also variable  as HDB staggers start month of selection within each launch,btohqsg
Ok  hoping to receive queue number and a chance to select a unit.,btohqsg
could you guys share  how long did your HFE took to get approved? many thanks.,btohqsg
Got ours within 1 week. Applied Jan16. Approved on Jan22,btohqsg
but that includes with submission of documents  correct?,btohqsg
Surprisingly one day  and it's PH,btohqsg
you get the email or you submit own self?,btohqsg

You will receive sms when there is an update (sms would not mention whether it is approved or not but ask you to login to check your status) of your HFE.After you login you go to check your HFE  and you can see the status like Approved and the EXPIRY DATE.There is no document of this piece of information for your to download  but you can do a Screenshot of the page.You will also receive sms 1month informing your HFE is expiring soon  and you can submit your HFE again only 30 days before your exiting one expire. If you try yo submit 1.5mths before expiry date  the system won't allow you to submit cos there is no button etc for you to continue.,btohqsg
