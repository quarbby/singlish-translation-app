Hi anyone know is it good to put rear aircon with usb charging for Honda vezel? 🙏,btohqsg
270k can buy tesla performance. 0-100kph 3.3sec,btohqsg
Why would you want to do that?Vezel small car. Aircon powerful enough.If not cold Maybe you need to do Aircon servicing.Wash fan blowerTop up gasWash Aircon radiator,btohqsg
So happening 😅 like H.K Drama. Police Story 2022,btohqsg
Ppl want to save money Ma. USB aircon no need petrol.,btohqsg
Because rear passenger complained no aircon. So going to fix it today. But the installer recommended me to put in usb charging port. Wondering is it good for the car? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
No la. Go do servicing. You install rear blower  also need spend 250+Aircon will break down also sooner or later if never service,btohqsg
USB aircon $10+ can already la,btohqsg
He rather dies than spend  another sec with the wife🫢,btohqsg
I think usb fan can already,btohqsg
I am installing this type of rear aircon. Just that don’t know want to add the usb charging port. This is for personal car. Not driving grab.,btohqsg
Personal car no need care passengers 1. Not happy ask them take mrt,btohqsg
If you do not have a requirement for the USB port  don't do it,btohqsg
If you feel like you will need it at some point of time can consider,btohqsg
I believe it should be a plug and play install as some variants overseas do come with rear aircon,btohqsg
If it is a plug and play install for the USB port go ahead,btohqsg
If it involves the cutting of wires  would refrain from doing so as it can cause electrical issues down the line,btohqsg
And most definitely voids your warranty if you have any on most electric components,btohqsg

ur new listing of the day?,btohqsg
Slow in modern day terms  but still quick enough. More like a refined gentleman  and name not tarnished yet unlike other marques. Yes reliability will be the biggest issue. But my guess is if can afford these kind of cars  can afford leaving in the workshop for 3 months haha,btohqsg
Damn right. It exudes class all over,btohqsg
Ya this is probably the most affordable tuner car these days. If u want o e let me know. My friend is selling the tofu one,btohqsg
I second this. And the leon sports tourer. But on the street  nothing within that performance range can beat the tesla,btohqsg
U need something way faster to catch it,btohqsg
Evs tend to lose stram at the high ramge but by then u are pretty far ahead and going at least 180kph,btohqsg
Haha didnt know his name. He's a nut too. Not jefferson level but still a lot. I dont think i have even half his experience,btohqsg
His Instagram handle really does sum his personality up,btohqsg
haha very friendly guy too  met him at a few car meets. Crazy crazy number of cars he has owned too,btohqsg
It really does. The golf 7r had quite a lot of work done to it.,btohqsg
