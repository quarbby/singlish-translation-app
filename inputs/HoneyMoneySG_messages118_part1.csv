Hi! Late to the game but I have both OCBC and UOB accts. For tax payment via cardup  would you recommend ocbc 90n or uob prvi miles?Also  i read the ocbc 90n tnc that miles will not be earned for tax payments.

Hi all  just curious is DBS the only bank that charges DCC fee for refunded transactions?I always have issue with refunded transactions being charged DCC fee by DBS and in a way I was charged DCC fee twice.I know other banks like HSBC will automatically refund DCC fees for refunded transactions.Just curious if any other banks also charges DCC twice like DBS?,btohqsg
is it transaction in foreign currency or sgd?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs in SGD but processed outside SG,btohqsg
Not the points conversion  more so on whether ive hit the 1k spending cap before my statement month ends,btohqsg
I always have issue with Mastercard payment on Agoda and it was processed in HK even though the currency is in SGDNo issue with Visa card thoughI have reached out to Agoda multiple times about this but they don‚Äôt see this as an issueAnd I will need to call DBS to refund the difference whenever there are refunded transactions from Agoda  and my recent request to refund DCC got denied by DBS and I have asked for them appeal again,btohqsg
If you are paying 1shot  i believe 90n has better earn rate for new to cardup (1.5% admin fee).Though  i think its better to pay income tax every month so you have better cash flow. Then uob prvi visa is better. Dont forget honey money sg has promo code for cardup.,btohqsg

I tried not to use Agoda as much as possible but their 18% rebate always has the best rate compare to other sites like trip or Expedia so I have no choice but to use AgodaAnd some times my plan change so I have to cancel rooms i booked on Agoda,btohqsg
