That is what happens when I need to stand for national anthem/flag raising and pledge,btohqsg
I hold onto the 2 sides so i feel more secured,btohqsg

It is just that ws there are a lot of dominant players sitting at the top (much less in ms where anyone in the top 20-30 can put off some upset),btohqsg
What about 17 y/o izaac quek that just got ticket to paris OG in tt,btohqsg
The thing is in WS  there are v dominant players on top  but she did put up commendable fight to CYF and even won ASY  so she is on the right path i guess,btohqsg
I'm supposedly going to see a Olympic qualifying game in Paris,btohqsg

But my dad scared the missile shoot the plane,btohqsg
"""In connection with the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games  the Air and Space Museum is offering a sports meeting to take to the skies on Saturday 15 June. Pole vaulting will be in the spotlight. The event  designed in collaboration with the company Perfe'o  co-founded by two former Olympic athletes  and with the Dynamic Aulnay Club  will be based on the unprecedented organization of a sports competition approved by the French Athletics Federation. It was an opportunity for visitors to discover this sport as close as possible to the athletes and  for athletics fans  to treat themselves to a show before the Olympic Games.Over the course of a day  spectators will have the chance to attend a pole vault competition that could be one of the last opportunities for pole vaulters to win their ticket for the Olympics. On the program is a national mixed competition from 12:30 p.m.  international women's competition at 3 p.m. and then international men's competition. Olympic champion Renaud Lavillenie has already confirmed his participation.""",btohqsg
France / europe is a nice place to go but it can also be dangerous üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Yea SQ is the only airline that made public announcement that it will change route,btohqsg
gna get hate crimed for not knowing how to speak french properly,btohqsg
The thing is the ticket to europe is crazy ex,btohqsg
i got mine for q cheap,btohqsg
not really dangerous in the typical sense. just be wary of pickpockets,btohqsg
like it‚Äôs rare that they‚Äôll come and mug you or wtv,btohqsg
SQ doesn't do LHR with any stopovers,btohqsg
can u name something he do that is disrespectful,btohqsg
How long in adv did u book ur tickets,btohqsg
So now i know how to get cheap on sQ,btohqsg
i did SQ straight to Zurich during my grad trip,btohqsg
U going on school or just personal,btohqsg
3 months in advance was 1.1k for two way,btohqsg
tbf it was like when the world was reopening after covid,btohqsg
i checked one month after we booked and the price doubled,btohqsg
And SQ does not fly to Hokkaido everyday,btohqsg
sin-hnd  nrt-sin is 890 in aug,btohqsg
If u book student tickets actually not bad,btohqsg
Cuz u get 1 time to reschedule,btohqsg
sometimes student price no more economy lite,btohqsg
but regular tix still have lite,btohqsg
then end up regular price cheaper,btohqsg
Yeah in fact a lot of exchange ppl do that,btohqsg
Cuz the dates not fully confirm so they book it like that,btohqsg
This one i wont even reach anywhere near it,btohqsg
one time complimentary change of travel date or destination,btohqsg
had to get my student tickets to US refunded bc of covid,btohqsg
was a pain in the ass,btohqsg
My dad said im unreasonable for wanting to fly sq,btohqsg
I had to do that for my Korea trip too,btohqsg
sq economy or PE not rly,btohqsg
Actually speaking of that idk if now I should buy travel insurance,btohqsg
Cuz I am on school sanction trip,btohqsg
Omt my friend‚Äôs parents got him a biz class ticket to nyc,btohqsg
They said that it is covered which idk I read the terms and they say got,btohqsg
But the coverage I damn confused,btohqsg
lol just buy your own and be safe,btohqsg
i mean travel insurance isn't too ex,btohqsg
i'd just buy to get a peace of mind,btohqsg
i need to buy car excess insurance,btohqsg
Idk when will my next sq flight be sia,btohqsg
Bro mine exchange it ain't cheap to buy 4 months of travel insurance,btohqsg
My last sq flight was in 2021 / 2022 i think,btohqsg
Lol imagine gg somewhere near just to get a cheap sq flight,btohqsg
esp if it's a shitty plane,btohqsg
It's like flying to Bangkok DMK cuz the tickets are cheap,btohqsg
pray to dear god you don't get the plane that killed a few hundred ppl,btohqsg
Oh yea near areas usually is the small planes,btohqsg
or the plane that got grandfathered in from silkair,btohqsg
My friend got a free teddy bear fr sq stewardess,btohqsg
The classic A320 for the short flights,btohqsg
And idk he more crazy then me la  go take a pic w the stewardess,btohqsg
not necessasrily sia KL gets A350s,btohqsg
I tot i was crazy enough to be their fan,btohqsg
u see penang get like 738,btohqsg
But i shy ask them for a photo,btohqsg
I will never fly scoot ever again,btohqsg
I took scoot just coz my dad ask me to pay myself if i want to take sq,btohqsg
As long as it's dirt cheap idc tbh scoot is like the Ryanair of Asia,btohqsg
The plane took off despite it being faulty,btohqsg
Never even provide details of the fault,btohqsg
Actually I prefer boeing ones cuz the flyby wire is better than the Airbus system for control,btohqsg
One moment said the plane delay coz there is a fault,btohqsg
ya but u don't even get IFE or wifi,btohqsg
do yall know any printing shops in singapore that can print posters,btohqsg
How does a freaking plane fault get sorted in 5min,btohqsg
Just unplug and sleep on flights,btohqsg
So mid flight my ear suddenly hurts + i cant hear anything,btohqsg
It lasted for a few hours actually,btohqsg
like just a square poster to put in your room,btohqsg
i cant remember the material name,btohqsg
Anyway in my opinion nth can beat sq,btohqsg
My worst experience was with airasia,btohqsg
I dun even dare to step my foot into 1,btohqsg
Budget airline is not worth it,btohqsg
Plane plummeted suddenly and my buttocks lifted from the seat,btohqsg
Nd i heard japan gonna hv another budget airline just started operation,btohqsg
The vomit bag suddenly became a hot commodity,btohqsg
Imagine u went to the toilet,btohqsg
most of the flight is on autopilot,btohqsg
ya fly up to like 2 500ft,btohqsg
there's always one pilot keeping a watch but they don't actively steer,btohqsg
I actually miss flying Singapore airlines,btohqsg
But my parents said it is too expensive,btohqsg
But i cant imagine sq to europe is cheaper than a flight to japan,btohqsg
every time i go longer distance i fly SQ or Emirates,btohqsg
I told myself I will not step my foot into a budget airline again,btohqsg
But now a lot is going on in the middle east,btohqsg
i meant in general like even from last time,btohqsg
anyway when i get on a plane  if it goes down  i just accept my fate,btohqsg
Idk why i get envious when ppl fly sqüíÄ,btohqsg
that's like a lot of days,btohqsg
Coz it has been a long while since i flew sq and i love sq,btohqsg
But my parents said it is too expensive,btohqsg
LMAO someone was in the toliet,btohqsg
U hv been saying that almost every day,btohqsg
He went out after with a lot more water in his face,btohqsg
Yeah it just suddenly jerk down,btohqsg
Then up as the autopilot corrected,btohqsg
I cant imagine being in the toilet or even walking back to my seat,btohqsg
Airasia the malaysia budget airline right,btohqsg
Also  small plane tend to jerk a lot more,btohqsg
I will be damn pissed if my parents bring my siblings to new zealand on SQ year end w/o meW their ‚Äòsq expensive‚Äô logic,btohqsg
I took Eva air to Taiwan lol,btohqsg
Is Eva air a budget airline,btohqsg
They also went london via sq too w/o me,btohqsg
National airline of Taiwan I think,btohqsg
It was a A340 not small,btohqsg
And then my mum was like ‚Äòi do not owe you anything‚Äô,btohqsg
if it's like going London  I'd just spend the money on SQ lol,btohqsg
Basically saying they do what they want to do,btohqsg
it's so far i'll spend for the comfort,btohqsg
Ive seen people fly to Taiwan then transit to london,btohqsg
More on just the relative amt,btohqsg
If so far it's likely in the thousands liao,btohqsg
1.3 vs 1.5 ain't as big compared to 300 vs 500,btohqsg
It is like my parents can care to spend sq for my siblings but when it comes to me  sq is not even an option,btohqsg
Aiya as siblings give and take mah,btohqsg
Like it is there but a closed option  not even a debate,btohqsg
Later they help you pay for uni then tell your siblings to work for theirs,btohqsg
You oldest child? Or middle child,btohqsg
My parents wun admit it but it seems to me they are bias,btohqsg
I think if this happens  my bro would rather not go uni coz it is damn lazy,btohqsg
As long as you are middle or oldest  you will always feel bias,btohqsg
Im surprised my jc grades last time is better than his now,btohqsg
Aiya time will tell ah  I'm the oldest between my brother and I,btohqsg
eh Qatar and Emirates still q safe,btohqsg
My brother is way more independent than me,btohqsg
But I also can sense bias  he get hurt always my fault when he was younger,btohqsg
other than the fact that they still fly through Iran,btohqsg
Actually maybe now too late but my dad said sq os $3k ish now,btohqsg
I can be at home  him at the playground with grandparents. Get hurt come back scold me,btohqsg
I'll be sure to send pictures of my drinks on my 14h flight,btohqsg
My dad scared missile shoot the plane,btohqsg
I'll send pictures of my crash (if got),btohqsg
And i will be sure to off this chat for that day,btohqsg
Been Alot of plane incidents lately,btohqsg
My bro feels this way (like he thinks everyone blame him if something happens w my sis)  and then he became more rebellious,btohqsg
I will be sure to pm u the pictures,btohqsg
I actually realised SQ does not fly to hakodate,btohqsg
So maybe need find our own transport there if we take sq,btohqsg
anw sq used to fly a340s on the longest route in the world,btohqsg
Nvm i always tell myself there is always next time when i earn $$ to take sq if i want to spend the $,btohqsg
or just earn miles and fly for free,btohqsg
Retired liao I flew in 2018 and 2019,btohqsg
Yea it's all about giving and taking,btohqsg
For me I legit dun care about that as I care more on destination,btohqsg
You don't feel like you are receiving but eventually you will,btohqsg
Coz before working cannot spend too much (im actually v thrifty)  i know some ppl like to spend $tho idk if it is their money or their parent‚Äôs,btohqsg
I wna fly on an a340 before they retire,btohqsg
I unintentionally tick that off ig.,btohqsg
now the most accessible a340 is Lufthansa,btohqsg
Wanna fly on a CRJ or an EJet,btohqsg
I will only fly ANA / SQ / Qatar / Emirates,btohqsg
I think the E190 the US carriers use,btohqsg
I heard good things about starlux,btohqsg
What route they use for that?,btohqsg
Oh so super short ones only hmm,btohqsg
But i think it should be comparable to sq,btohqsg
For scoot I oni seen their dreamliners,btohqsg
scoot has a grand total of 4 types in its fleet,btohqsg
Scoot is not worth unless it is a 1-2h flight,btohqsg
U can read all the -ve reviews,btohqsg
altho I wldve preferred A330s over 787s lol,btohqsg
787 is still nb just depends on their maintenance,btohqsg
My dad was searching the plane and plane age when deciding which flight to book,btohqsg
He wanted to avoid that problematic boeing and the 20y/o plane,btohqsg
I wan the tri engine jets as well but those are literally just with cargo airlines now,btohqsg
they had their major issues early on iirc,btohqsg
How cool would it be go fly the MD-11,btohqsg
idk how much i trust it anymore,btohqsg
If I take a Boeing will I live to tell the tale,btohqsg
uhhhhhhh wah i had a few in mind a couple of months ago but i forgot,btohqsg
wait let me see if i can dig it up,btohqsg

Try to do a catch me if you can in real life,btohqsg

Random but how do i overcome phone phobia,btohqsg
ask someone call u everyday then you'll get used to it,btohqsg
And also i cant speak properly on phone,btohqsg
idk lehs I think for me I like to put on speaker so it's not the person screaming into my ear,btohqsg
I think it makes it slightly better,btohqsg
Idk if it is shy or what but i hv been scared of phone calls,btohqsg
Like dreading it unless it is someone i know,btohqsg

I need to hv the dadan to do this,btohqsg

True that‚Ä¶but idk why i just dun speak normally over the phone unless it is someone i know personally on the line,btohqsg
At most it will only last less than 5min,btohqsg
skill issue. some people needs time to think about what they want to say,btohqsg
It is not that  i referring to my tone,btohqsg
and hor either way wtv phone call u making not like the other person on the phone is out to get u,btohqsg

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It‚Äôs not a story the Jedi would tell you. It‚Äôs a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith  so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life‚Ä¶ He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful‚Ä¶ the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power  which eventually  of course  he did. Unfortunately  he taught his apprentice everything he knew  then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death  but not himself.,btohqsg

Put it simply  they grew up in a generation where parenting and society is very diff from the parenting and society we live in today.So your views will differ alot from them in many ways. The same way our grandparents view of the world differed from our parents. There is nothing inherently wrong  you just have to work to their weaknesses,btohqsg
Cmon u achieve more than I did lmao,btohqsg
The struggles you face today is as well very different from the struggles your parents had. They understand you are struggling but will never fully understand the reasons behind it.That's why there is a disconnect,btohqsg
actually this make sense  i know last time my mum was definitely more independent and everything she settled herself coz her parents were somewhat uneducated and poor,btohqsg

This could be a subtle reason because you see the accomplishments of your mumAnd you feel like you have not done as much as her so you feel like you are lacking,btohqsg
Don't feel inferior because you did not do as much  her life when she was your age is very diff from yours.,btohqsg
very true  your own struggles  you ownself find your way out of it,btohqsg
