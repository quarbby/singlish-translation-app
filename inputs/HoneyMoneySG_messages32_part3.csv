That is the limit that employers have to pay you CPF until  aka if you earn 9k your employee CPF contribution will still be 1.6k (20% pegged to 8k),btohqsg
What do the $6k and beyond numbers mean tho?,btohqsg
Currently the CPF ceiling is at $6k  meaning that employers only have to pay you up to 17% of $6k currently  and your employee contribution also capped at 20% of $6k. This $6k will be gradually increased to $8k by 1 Jan 2025. You do the math lol,btohqsg
ohhh so as of now  if I earn $20k  only 37% of $6k will be contributed to CPF?,btohqsg
but in 2025  37% of $8k will be contributed to my CPF if I earn $20k,btohqsg

Anyone have tried to apply the citi prestige to get 120k points as a existing member?,btohqsg
Ps. The cashback is in the form of the SCB reward points right?,btohqsg
Nop this $200 cashback is in the form of cash credit to your CC account,btohqsg
Should I use citi rewards card directly or the amaze card for this? Will I even be entitled for 10x miles?,btohqsg
When in doubt  use Amaze and should be eligible  i used mine for AF membership,btohqsg
Wait does this apply for comfort delgro booking? Or in general spend like in challenger  F&B?,btohqsg
Kris+ and CRMC don’t go together,btohqsg
CRMC excluded reward earned via mobile wallet ( Apple Pay or Google Pay ),btohqsg
Ah I see... That's interesting.. Shall wait for Amaze to be included in Apple Wallet.. then it will be included alr right?,btohqsg
Yeah then it will be possible as it the work around for android phoneSo basically don’t add CRMC onto Apple Pay use amaze or those accept credit card directlyLike MacDonald app which accept both credit card or via Apple PayCRMC direct credit work but Apple Pay option don’t work,btohqsg
Agoda has very nice tie-ins with DBS -> you can book via a dedicated site for 15-20% off  but not sure if the promo ended alr,btohqsg

"If you earn 20k I'm pretty surprised you didn't bother to find out that your CPF is capped. Unless of course you are some big shot minister who ""feels rich when he looks at his CPF statement""",btohqsg
A bout a few days like 3-5 working day  hsbc will send you a email regarding the transaction I had the same issue before,btohqsg
Nice  I booked my acomms at 18% off  very significant savings,btohqsg
But note that it’s capped at $40 per transaction so book each hotel individually and don’t lump them into one big order to book if you’re staying at multiple places,btohqsg
Hi... if amaze + cmrc paywave on comfort will get 4miles/dollar?,btohqsg
If my statement is on the 15th means is from 16th to 15? Or 15 to 14th?,btohqsg

Will I get Cashback for UOB 1 if I use it to pay for Grablater ?,btohqsg
if im not wrong because you are award based anything $1k and below  hence once above meaning $1k not earn. as the $1 push above hence it wont earn any,btohqsg
no pay later charge is qausi-cash,btohqsg
most likely yes unless comfort use another MCC,btohqsg
So I can use like Amex Cashback card to pay,btohqsg
noted  will do that and thanks for the prompt reply and advice!,btohqsg

Maybe give it awhile  a bit lagging sometime after posting,btohqsg
