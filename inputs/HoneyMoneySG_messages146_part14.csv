Hello  does citi rewards credit card blacklist airbnb txn from getting 4 miles per $1?,btohqsg
Seems like they also removed the cash back for giro payment to credit cards ? I don’t see those this month,btohqsg
Only way is to reliably check  is to check with CSO.,btohqsg
Hi  i’m still new to the credit card game. If I want to do online transactions  do I put my amaze card detail or my CRMC card detail to get my 4mpd? I know offline requires me to tap my amaze card.,btohqsg
most online transactions dont need amaze for crmc to work. Thou we had some quirky situation like Lazada 2C2*,btohqsg
ahhh I see.. so I guess safe side just put in my amaze card details?,btohqsg
can also. Just be careful of amaze 1k limit per calendar month while crmc resets per statement month.,btohqsg
A fellow personal finance and retirement planning Telegram group (1M65) with 30K+ followers has been suspended.https://youtu.be/Nv3Ae8ExbngApparently  this is the story:- There were some bots posting pornographic content in the midnight hours where moderators are not active- A user reported the group to Telegram Authorities instead of the Group admins- Telegram suspended the group and Mr Loo (owner) is now seeking for appeal after the cleanupLessons to be learnt- For any offensive content posted  please contact@adminto alert instead.- Shieldy bot is irritating  but it is here to protect the group and the members by filtering such content. So I seek your understanding to pass the bot check if you are new.,btohqsg
I didnt know the moderator bot needs to pay 🥲,btohqsg
Hihi is this also on 1st of next statement month? Same as lady card ?,btohqsg
VS bonus comes in following statement. Lady’s bonus comes in 1st working day of following calendar month.,btohqsg
You got the sample how the VS bonus transaction look like?,btohqsg
"A lot of these spam bots bypass Shieldy bot also. Some also wait for days or months before they ""activate"". The admins are doing our best to ""pre-ban"" based on some patterns they show when they join.",btohqsg
Sometimes I noticed some profiles were obvious scammers but they hid their user id so I can't ban them 😔,btohqsg
Can one. We admin got access to see all group actions... Including join/leave.. 🤭,btohqsg
https://www.cpf.gov.sg/service/article/if-i-have-a-pension-or-annuity-can-i-withdraw-my-retirement-savings———————————-You can withdraw your retirement savings if you have a pension or annuity that provides you with monthly payouts for life. The amount of retirement savings you can withdraw will depend on themonthly payout you receive from your pension/annuity.,btohqsg
Hi  between ocbc 365 and trust Cashback which is better for oversea dining?,btohqsg
Hi Experts! Can I check if I do OA to SA transfer  can I withdraw anything above FRS after turning 55?I just knew that any rstu is not lump sum withdrawable even you have exceeded FRS. Only through normal contribution is allow.,btohqsg
Usually based on normal rtsu it is still possible to withdraw everything above frs since the normal rtsu will form part of frs.For example:Normal contributions over the years = $300kRtsu = $100kFrs = $250kYou will still be able to easily withdraw $150k (400-250).,btohqsg
Yes you are right. Do note that any interest earned on RSTU amounts cannot be withdrawn and is set aside in your RA.,btohqsg
trust cashback (dining category  min $500/mth for 3 months) > ocbc 365 (min $800/mth) > trust cashback (no min spend  non dining category),btohqsg
Haha! I call cpf just now and raise similar exampleI.e. at 55  I have FRS + 12Kbut before I turn 55  I RSTU 8K  so does that means I can only with 4k only? She told me yes...,btohqsg
So using your logic  I should be able to draw 12k less any interest accrued from the 8k,btohqsg
dcs flex needs $600 which is in the upper range for you. might cause forced spending. can also consider uob one or maybank plat visa which has lower min spend,btohqsg
My logic is if u are normal worker. Work for life. U can safely withdraw all amounts above frs even if u max contribute annually,btohqsg
Eh? Why ah? Shouldn’t it still be 12k withdrawable? Anything above FRS can withdraw right?,btohqsg
Correct but most normal people won’t have thisThey will already have amounts way above frs excluding rtsu,btohqsg
Ya.. she say rstu and interest strictly only withdrawable through monthly payouts at 65,btohqsg
Correct but just think of it this way and u won’t be worried.U are withdrawing your normal work contributions above frs amount.Your rtsu contributions happily forming the base frs locked up.,btohqsg
I wonder how much porn was posted. If it's just one post  and the user reported it to Telegram. Then getting suspended is too much. That's too easy to get any group suspended.,btohqsg
So in this case  I can withdraw only 50k instead of 150k because 100k from rstu which form my Retirement sum,btohqsg
Not right. U forgot your employee normal contributions,btohqsg
No. It’s total CPF - frs,btohqsg
