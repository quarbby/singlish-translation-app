Yeaa financial report is the best,btohqsg
I prefer to stay cautious haha,btohqsg
Not too long ago VP have the same hype,btohqsg
Personal opinion is MT might reach 1.5 at most. Those tat have been holding medical stocks have been monitoring & buying the stocks for quite sometime already.  It might not be easy to rope in alot more new investors as they thk the stocks prices are too high to join in now.My guess for TG is $3.3+ maxRS before bonus is $3.9+ maxüò¨,btohqsg
My 2 cents worth   all got excited because of Boss Heng visit. Frankly  make no sense.,btohqsg
Yes I agree on the price. Maybe worth a punt at this price.,btohqsg
You are saying this because you saw the price action,btohqsg
View yourself as a businessman  and share your vision with us.,btohqsg
This one I might agreeSeems like he have been playing the medical game long le,btohqsg
I consider myself late to medical stocks leMT 0.2+UG 0.6TG 3+ or 4+,btohqsg
No. Just the unnecessary excitement it causes .Recently our egg BB also visited a company  not even a ripple in the stock market.,btohqsg
Tell me what kind of meat you want see lol,btohqsg
There's a reason why all gloves counter go bonus shares/splits,btohqsg
This sounds sensibleAnother 20-30% increase seems likely,btohqsg
MT how much target depends on Q3. If Q3 is same as Q2 it should cross 2 dollars. What if Q3 profit is double of Q2? In that case it will be a different scenario. Personal opinion anyway.,btohqsg
I think market is more forward looking imo,btohqsg
That is why TG price didn't move up despite their stellar report,btohqsg
MT guidance is important. If they have orders lined up for 2021 or beyond it will make a difference. Hope they release guidance along with Q3.,btohqsg
And also why their price went from 3 to 2 within a few days,btohqsg
Who really earn?The people manipulating loh,btohqsg
You are right tat the stock should be worth $2 up. But the price will move up only if alot of investors dare to buy up  which I feel many dare not anymore. U agree? üòÅ,btohqsg
If we do see the price chiong up  we should noe who‚Äôs buying to attract attention. üòÅ,btohqsg
One step at a time  there is no limit to how high or how Low a stock can move. Only our risk appetite.,btohqsg
Then we got to be careful. üòõ,btohqsg
If you play medical stocks early you can see the pattern shift le,btohqsg
Last time all one way rocket,btohqsg
One step forward two steps back,btohqsg
Not really. You see fear and greed work the same way unfortunately. Many who were burned once they see price go up will rush back in. Unfortunately that is the behaviour of average investors.,btohqsg
Which is what I am seeing now haha,btohqsg
All the optimism out of nowhere!,btohqsg
Q3 result expected 20% or more compare with Q2,btohqsg
Two more weeks we will know,btohqsg
When TG dropped from 3 to 2 someone said funds exited le ask all to be weary.When MT dropped to less than 1 people say medical bubble bursting ask to buy at 0.8,btohqsg
Just sharing some of the sentiments not so long ago in the chat,btohqsg
All the optimism from Trump.. tis one i still dont q get it,btohqsg
But put it this way MT also kena sold down quite a lot already,btohqsg
But I honestly can't expect that kind of crazy action again la,btohqsg
Now always one step up two steps back,btohqsg
If want to buy.. better buy near $1,btohqsg
This one I no comment but I prefer to trade with caution,btohqsg
Unless someone can tell me a catalyst on why medical stocks in play again hsha,btohqsg
If not hold till your children or grandchildren and pass it to them,btohqsg
My personal opinion is for MT the risk vs reward right now is better for upside than down side.,btohqsg
So better don't chase when up unless you set SL,btohqsg
Ya. There‚Äôs always some comments to create panic here. 4000+ members wor. I was affected by the TG dropped to 2.05 at one stage  but after the FY results was out & the company bought back the shares between $2.3+ to $2.6+  I‚Äôm SUPER confident BBs will not dare to lower the price anywhere below the $2.5 now. Coz that will likely trigger more buyback & investors whom did their homework will gobble up the shares at low prices. üòÅ,btohqsg
Did the price move much after results released?Answer is no,btohqsg
3 to 2 and back to 3,btohqsg
"Hindsight people will tell you ""yes it rise from low 2s to 3""",btohqsg
The potential of moving up is way higher than the chances of the price falling to a point to create panic. So I‚Äôm in for the risk.,btohqsg
But it's exactly the same group of people that tell you VP confirm going back to 0.7 before results released,btohqsg
