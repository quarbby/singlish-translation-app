I'm working on my H2s during December,btohqsg
If you need a study buddy or something  I don't mind.,btohqsg
"""As much time as you can put in"" is a generic answer  but that should be the way",btohqsg
That should not be the ideal way  do enjoy your personal life pls. Studying is not everything,btohqsg
Try to strike a balance between studies and personal time ig,btohqsg
It's alright to study if you want that A  but not at the cost of burning yourself out,btohqsg
i think back then my jc they spent like 6 hours a day around there  and they got like 86 points average,btohqsg
Honestly doubt rp has a perfectly linear relationship with studying time  theres probably a point where it inverts and grinding too hard becomes bad for ur rp (and mental health),btohqsg
its not perfect  but there must be a threshhold where there is correlation,btohqsg
Understanding the content and asking help from teachers and peers probably helps way more than doing that extra paper,btohqsg
But yes  not studying at all ofc = fail,btohqsg
Taking note of key concepts u dont understand and asking help from others to iron out misconceptions imo is best way to study; bonus is u get to have a life. PS  Remember to note down and file solution along with misconception.No hard and fast rule for studying time  as much as u can to understand and reinforce concepts  while balancing with other aspects of life,btohqsg
thanks guys for all of ur responses !!,btohqsg

Quite rare to find safe entry jobs that are higher than that,btohqsg
I'm considering joining NYP after o levels,btohqsg
How is the school culture and is it easy to get a high GPA?,btohqsg
honestly everyone will have different opinions on that tho,btohqsg
so far the schs gd tbh and how easy it is to get a gd gpa rlly depends on how interested you are in your course or which course u take and also how comitted u are to your work,btohqsg
Is the GPA exam-oriented or GPA oriented,btohqsg

"Hi guysI need your opinionsMy friend and her friends have enough of their company supervisor  but they don't dare to complain to their lecturer / programme chairTheir company supervisor kept asking them to do an assignment at super last minuteE.g. their supervisor will ask them to do an assignment today and have to submit by tomorrow afternoonAnother example:My friend has written e-logbook and her supervisor has been reading her logbook for 10 weeks already. Her supervisor did not mention anything bad about her e-logbook until yesterday. She has to remove some ""unnecessary"" pictures from weeks 1 to 10",btohqsg
Do y'all think they should complain to their lecturer / programme chair?,btohqsg
if they rly cant tolerate it then they shld voice out,btohqsg
no point keeping it to themselves,btohqsg
They are afraid to do so as they think that this would just make the matter worseLike if their supervisor know that they complain to their programme chair  they think that their supervisor may purposely torture them even further,btohqsg
So  not sure if they should complain or continue bearing,btohqsg
its up to them whether they want to speak up,btohqsg
if they speak up smth may be done to prevent the supervisor from continuing with his actions but if they dont then they will hv to just bear w it n suffer,btohqsg
