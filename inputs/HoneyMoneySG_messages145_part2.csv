Can use Citi prestige cc with  Kris pay?,btohqsg
Can check if official store in lazada or shopee have stock u want then see if can use 12 12 voucher,btohqsg
Hi guys  want to check for Endowus  since both Amundi and BlackRock IE replicates S&P 500  and theoretically IE has lower annual cost. how come when i see annualised 1 year returns  Amundi is higher than IE?,btohqsg
Amundi says 33.41% and IE says 32.46%,btohqsg
hi all  i have a question that sounds silly but i'd like to confirm. say we're collecting miles â€” coming from diff credit cards diff banks. if we redeem to krisflyer  all the miles add up  is that correct?,btohqsg
Hi all  may I ask are payments for medical checkups are typically under eligible transactions for singsaver?,btohqsg
Best to check MCC and tally against t&c.,btohqsg
UserSamuelhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no shopee links,btohqsg
also  i think there's quite a few combinations and probably asked too many times but..if im paying for a tour  chan brothers  what would be the best way to accumulate miles (still not sure if i'd like to go down this path but been using CRMC + Amaze)? the full price is around 17k. my mom wants the free luggage. she has UOB Lady's  me too. we'd have to pay separately 5.8k per card to get the luggage. not sure if this is worth compared to miles as we're forfeiting 4.8k each because the cap for UOB Lady's is 1k a month?===some context:i spend less than 500 on card so i think it might be tough for those min spend cards  though 500 maybe still possible.. but im thinking in the long run as this payment for the trip is pretty much a one offthe only useful card i have is:UOB Lady's  the preferred category i default it for travelis there any promotion that i can grab (i think this i can take a look at singsaver/moneysmart)? what cards would y'all recommend? the cards i'll probably only use for travel in the future,btohqsg
Citi crmc exclude travel transaction for bonus point.,btohqsg
yup queenie! im aware of that  thanks!,btohqsg
UOB KF with Kris+ is best I think. 17k x (3mpd and 1mpd). 68k KF miles is better than luggage imo.,btohqsg
i see! crap i forgot theres the timerhonestly  i think i'd end up taking economy at the rate im going HAHA. plus if i were to soak up the miles  i think ill need to compensate my mom too  only fair to herwill take a look at UOB KF and Kris+! thanks Anthony!are there any other combi though?,btohqsg
Just apply for ntb and get a luggage for her haha,btohqsg
sorry whats ntb? she has many luggages already HAHA. but i have to compensate her in some wayalso im paying directly to the agency  so i suppose thats contactless. have to check whether the points/benefits will work etcis there any other bank i can grab promotions for?i have these below:CRMCSC SmartUOB Lady'sDBS Live Fresh from when i was a studentOCBC InfinityTrust Cashback,btohqsg
New to bank.68k KF miles can get her a business flight to many places. Best compensation hehe.Btw  at 17k amount  it bursts almost all 4mpd cards.,btohqsg
oh! unfortunately both of us have UOB lady's.. that biz class flight sounds awesome!i still have to ask  what if we're able to split up the payments  to probably sign up for other cards for sign up promo (typical i know :'))  or just UOB KF done deal?,btohqsg
HSBC signup gives luggage I think.I got one offer for amex Kris flyer but it seems targeted.,btohqsg
OH YES! hsbc live+ i think.. but just thought of this â€” problem is if we split  kinda tough to hit the miles to convert to KF miles too,btohqsg
Personally with chan bro  staff advice there might be issue if refund need to be initiate for krispay.So unless u are hitting challenge for krispay. I prefer to spilt payment on uob trio. Ppv/vs/lady. And u get delay payment until the deadline anyway.In theory if spilt on uob ladyx2/ppv/vs u can finish the payment in 3 months. Just need to go down 3 time that all,btohqsg
> staff advice there might be issue if refund need to be initiate for krispaydamn.. ahhh hmmm> And u get delay payment until the deadline anywayyes heard from my mom this too!thanks for this queenie!,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t UOB PRVI only at 1.4MPD?,btohqsg
Thanks! Let me go research that!,btohqsg
I not keen in uob chan bro luggage not that great anyway haha. 68k miles is nicer to me,btohqsg
i remember reading on the miles valuation before but is there an average price? i'd like to compensate my momso anthony's saying UOB KF w Kris+ / krispayqueenie you're saying Ppv/vs/lady,btohqsg
> uob ladyx2/ppv/vs u can finish the payment in 3 monthsqueenie  you said split? do you mean like an instalment? i thought we'd have to pay in 2 sessions â€” first to book and pay deposit  next is collected nearing the departure date? not sure on this either,btohqsg
Just offer alternatives. Both should work but with the caveat of UOB KF + Kris+ as Queenie mentions.I suggested based on available information but it cannot beat personal experience from Queenie.,btohqsg
yup gotcha! thank you both. yeah just asking as you guys are the most experienced and i will go read up on them!,btohqsg
I canâ€™t find online about getting 3 MPD for Malaysia usage. Can you share more on this pls.,btohqsg
UOB website. Ignore the last 2 column as its fcy promo.,btohqsg
Upgrade your Lady card to Solitaire and open Lady saving account.First month: pay $2k to earn 20 000 miles if you have $100k saving.2nd month to 9th month : pay $2k monthly till settle with $10k Lady saving to earn 6mpd every month.Total miles earned: 20 000 miles + 6mpd x $15k= 110 000 miles.,btohqsg
hey thanks for this MH! unfortunately i dont qualify for that 120k AI haha,btohqsg
hey guys dont mind if i just shoot some questions here. but if anyone is willing for me to pm  i'd appreciate it! so as not to spam this groupi have read the bank's site on the card  the full t&cs (not in depth just the important ones) and milelion's blog postfor UOBKF  is it me or i cant find that chan bro is under any of the category? im quite confused. i see there's multiple ways to get KF miles. not too sure how the miles are earned3 mpd on SIA Group  Kris+  dining  food delivery  online shopping  online travel  transport: is chan bro under like online shopping or something? i see online travel is those like agoda  tripdotcom  etc.oh and anthony may i ask how you got 3mpd + 1mpd?thank you,btohqsg
right.. pay via krispay? may i ask if i can link any card to this? i mean defo UOBKF! oopsanother related question  i saw this:> Each new Kris+ user must successfully make a minimum payment ofSingapore Five Dollars (S$5) via Apple Pay or Google PayTM via the paymentfunction in the Kris+ app at any Kris+ partner with Kris+ payment enabled  orby purchasing a Kris+ in-app voucher.i suppose i can use any card to meet this requirement? didnt really see if it has to be mastercard or visa or UOBKF,btohqsg
Can be any card that can be added to apple pay/google pay but uob kf is the only one uncapped 3mpd.And you earn additional 1kf mile per dollar on chan brothers.,btohqsg
thanks anthony! ah... so if i were to say split payment e.g.  we've 2 UOB lady's â€” 1k each  add them to gpay/apple pay  bust the limits. add UOBKF and pay for the remaining with it. this works?,btohqsg
Yes. Assume chan bros allows u to do that.,btohqsg
Hold on. Is chan bros on kris+ still travel for uob lady? I recall some travel agency via kris+ not in travel mcc for uob lady.,btohqsg
now i understand why you said just use UOBKF.. since it's at 4mpd overall. are the KF miles immediately credited? even after reading im still lost ðŸ¥²ill have to check whether chan bros allows to splitqueenie  ill still look at your combi HAHA,btohqsg
if that's the case  i think best to just do UOBKF. else  it's queenie's approach,btohqsg
For uob kf & kris+ combo  the 1mpd will be under kris pay miles and can be transferred immediately to KF acct. then you will get 3mpd next month in ur KF acct (ard 4-6th of the month),btohqsg
bless you anthony  thank you! always so helpful.. thanks thanks!!,btohqsg
yes! i searchedchanand saw that too. thanks MH!,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/172748this thread is quite insightful!actually i just realised something. i wont be able to split up the payments .. as this decision is rather last minute. the departure date is 24 jan next yeari suppose the best way to do this is UOB KF...? so 3mpd since paying via kris+ wouldnt work due to the mcc,btohqsg
It works. The 3mpd will be awarded based on Kris+ for uob kf but not awarded based on mcc.,btohqsg
i see! but there's still the extra 1mpd? also from what anthony mentioned above from the UOBKF + Kris+ comboMH you also said this HAHAMy understanding is:1).Avoidusing UOB Krisflyer2).Donâ€™tpay via Kris+ pay.,btohqsg
also i would like to clarify for UOB lady's the points  or just in general (say for CRMC too) as i do track the transactions. i understand it's capped @ $1k spent a month. if i've already spent  say 100  on a non selected category  i still qualify for the full 1k spent a month? i.e.  bonus 3.6mpd   since it's 4mpd and the base is 0.4mpd,btohqsg
Avoid using UOB KF to pay directly.I thought shall pay using Kris+ with uob kf?,btohqsg
1) avoid paying with uob kf directly2) dont use uob lady travel via kris+ at chan bros,btohqsg
