Recurrence is Maths Induction taught last time in H2 Maths? old old syllabus* (from what I saw from my cousin 2012/13 notes),btohqsg
Math induction was never taught in h2 maths,btohqsg
Well for my batch at least idk abt the others,btohqsg
Cus the H2 FM subject used to be discontinued and then continued,btohqsg
If I were to say to my score of easiness to hardness :.Numerical Methods -> Matrices -> ODEs -> 1.1-1.4 -> Recurrence -> Linear Spaces.,btohqsg
I would say spend more time on Linear Spaces first.,btohqsg
Numerical Methods  saw the syllabus seems identical to 9709 Maths Paper 2/3.The newer 9231 Math Syllabus (2018 onwards) removed alot of things in Linear Spaces I believe. As the paper was split into AS and A2. From 2 papers (Further Pure + Further Stat/Mechanics) to 4 papers [ FP1 / FP2 / FMech / FStat ],btohqsg
do yall know if poly grads apply Uni and receive an offer   can we reject it ?,btohqsg
Pretty sure someone scanned the textbook for this online. If you plan to study without JC notes.Just need to take care of how you source Study Materials and compare the syllabi between Singapore and Cambridge syllabus. What you need / not need to study.I glanced through  seems mostly Identical learning outcomes.And just drill through harder JC's Prelim / Actual TYS.,btohqsg
you can delay offers  saying you might want to do some gap year. Before rejecting it.,btohqsg
it was in the old syllabus 9740  2016 and before,btohqsg
Yeah I can confirm   I had a h2 math book that had math induction   many years ago,btohqsg
was in syllabus 2016 and before,btohqsg
I took an unconventional approach to improving my stats at poly - using jc notes to study poly probability distribution  it worked for my case but it won't work in reverse ofc (i.e. studying jc stats using poly notes won't work then and won't work now),btohqsg

Considering we have members here üíÄ who are below 18   such post is off the limit,btohqsg
I was in fb group and gt promoted to admin after having help the group write math materials,btohqsg
I seen a lot of indecent post in the group ...,btohqsg
Why the weather so humid haiz,btohqsg
Wtf the auntie infront of me balling in the ezlink...$400+ üíÄ,btohqsg

Anyone know how to cope with exam stress...  i just failed a bunch of tests lol damn sad,btohqsg
Go back  find out why you failed  which concepts youre weak at  study up on those then redo the test again,btohqsg
Failing isnt inherently a bad thing,btohqsg
that's not exam stress. That's stress from not knowing what to do.Key things(1) Did you study before the exams?(2) How long did you study? Do you think it was sufficient?(3) How did you conduct your revision? Do you think it was effective?(4) Anything you could have done better?,btohqsg
I didnt rly study and crammed 2 wks before,btohqsg
Think i need to start earlier,btohqsg
I agree. Exams is a form of feedback mechanism.Failing just means that you didn't do something right. So just go back and fix what was not right,btohqsg
2 weeks before seems like a lot of time damn,btohqsg
depending on the level  the higher the level  the more the consistency of revision needed,btohqsg
you can do it. If you think procrastination is the problem  then set a timetable and plan your work.,btohqsg
no  the most important thing now is to look through your mistakes  and at least for the maths and science subjects  redo the questions one round.It will help you greatly.,btohqsg
no point starting early if your way of working through it is fundamentally flawed,btohqsg
like imo if you're alr solid there  two weeks is enough to stop yourself from failing,btohqsg
Well for my case  during my n levels year  I started serious exam mugging like months before the paper  you may be taking a different paper but the idea is similar ---  last minute mugging simply don't work,btohqsg
When you mugging last minute   your body isn't used to the pace you see  so my teacher try to create a class culture of incremental studying   every day the study load increase a bit and going on full load weeks before the exam date,btohqsg
I see i see good points ya,btohqsg
I can share that the reason why i didnt do as well for As was because i priortised quantity instead of qualityDo tys  havent even read through mistakes  start doing another year. Then another year. And then another year. Then in the end never even correct myself and retry the papers with all my errors,btohqsg
I think if you are able to distill and pinpoint the chapters youre bad at  do the topical revisions for them again  youll do fine the next time around,btohqsg
Assuming you actually do learn from all your mistakes,btohqsg
Are you from jc  poly  ite or uni?,btohqsg
i think this john guy likes carti a lil too much,btohqsg
