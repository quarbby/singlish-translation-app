Thanks! That what I wanted to achieve last month  however missed 1 day later to transfer out my salary.,btohqsg
Yes. U need minimum ADB $3500 n above,btohqsg
Those who need capita evoucher  now still have promo  not fully redeem yet according to website. Link your paylah to capitastar member  buy 100 get extra 10 with dbs catd,btohqsg
Wondering if we redeem a saver ticket and choose to change dates (pay $25) can you choose any dates?,btohqsg
thanks. got my $10 bonus. note that can get 1 per member per day weekend)  max of 5 in promo period,btohqsg
Then which card should I use? Dbs live fresh for 5%?,btohqsg
No reward coz ecapita mcc is exclued,btohqsg
It was slow this weekend  last week was fully redeem within hours,btohqsg
Oooo not even 1.2mpd from dbs altitude? Tia,btohqsg
also remember to withdraw out the bonus interest on the same day too.,btohqsg
if need to reset choose a shorter month  ideally Feb. I thinking during the reset month maybe can transfer the full amount to HSBC EGA. but I havent really compute to see worth it or not.,btohqsg
OCBC allows paynow salary too but it needs to be paynow giro and not paynow fast. They will see the transaction code of salary too in order to qualify,btohqsg
Hsbc ega current promotion better or is t bills better?,btohqsg
no one knows what's the next t-bills result... maybe you can put competitive but need to consider the opportunity cost if you didn't get it. try to apply on the last day to minimise the number of days the amount is out of your interest earning savings account.,btohqsg
How do we know if a salary credit meet OCBC 360 criteria? Is there a similar tracker like UOB one shows that the salary requirement is fulfilled?,btohqsg
Nope  only amex capita  uob absolute  amex truecashback earn rebate for ecapita purchase. However this is dbs promo  have to use dbs payment mode,btohqsg
Yes  use the web portal. There‚Äôs a tracker that shows the amount of salary that has been credited for the month,btohqsg
You can't connect Hsbc revo to amaze right?,btohqsg
Only master card can connect. Revo is visa.,btohqsg
This one need to ask your hr or payroll. So instead of crediting the salary to you via your bank account  they will credit it to you via paynow using your nric and it will be sent to the bank account which you registered paynow nric with,btohqsg
What would you guys do if bank refused to waive credit card interest charge?,btohqsg
Just to check for ocbc 360 account,btohqsg
If let‚Äôs say within a year  if I do not qualify for the $500 savings a month category in that 1 month  they will not give the bonus interest for the $500 savings category for the entire year or just that 1 specific month?,btohqsg
Has anyone seen the good things savings promotion by UOB? Wanted to ask if the earmarked funds for the promotion will still earn the standard interest in the UOB one account,btohqsg
Corrected :Assume your usage use (800 $- 1200$ spending per month on mainly mobile contactless and online)  Ocbc Frank used to give u the best cashback. But after they revised their cashback structure  Evol looks good as u suggest :)OCBCFrank: Cashback is capped at S$25 for Online spendandMobile Contactless spend. Total: $25UobEvol: Cashback is capped at S$20 on Online spend and S$20 on Mobile Contactless spend. Total: $40.,btohqsg
For OCBCFRANK  online and mobile contactless have atotalcap of $25  not each.,btohqsg
singtel app is not consider utilities?,btohqsg
Hi for evol card if i used apple pay on dining is it considered dining or contactless category?,btohqsg
$20 for online and $20 for contactless  dining or other  doesn't matter.,btohqsg
Thanks for correcting me. It was $25 for each of the above categories and 6% rebate. Looks like it had been changed.,btohqsg
Yes  it's been nerfed last November iirc,btohqsg
Yes earmarked fund can still earn interest,btohqsg
Any advise on savings account that does not have any minimum balance requirement.  Thanks.,btohqsg
What is the MCC code for buying CapitaVoucher from Customer Service Counter in CapitaLand Mall? Can clock the $500 min spend for OCBC credit card sign up promotion?,btohqsg
Think they stopped selling physical vouchers donkey time ago already.,btohqsg
telco mcc is separate from utilities mcc,btohqsg
It was 6% before the nerf of $25 each for mobile contactless and online categories :),btohqsg
Amaze might have tighten to disallow the use of family members' mastercard ^^,btohqsg
Actually how they know the name on the linked card ah,btohqsg
Sorry  I can't answer this question üòÅ,btohqsg
I'mis this cannot link card or no Cashback?,btohqsg
Existing linked card not affected I think. But bad news üòî,btohqsg
I think not affected for now bah,btohqsg
It should work unless you keep linking and delinking.,btohqsg
Oh no  how about eVoucher to gift someone?,btohqsg
It doesn't work right from the first attempt. I'm just informing the community here. If the link to other people mastercard has been working for you  I think just look out for Amaze notice (if any) or potential issues when charging transactions.Personally  I think is a gap to allow pairing of mastercards that is not the same name as the Amaze cardholder.,btohqsg
May I know does HSBC EGA account have any withdrawal limitations? Let‚Äôs say I withdraw 2k today and the rest of the amount will still eligible to earn 4.3% right ?,btohqsg
What is the MCC code for eCapitaVoucher online purchase? Can clock the $500 min spend for OCBC credit card sign up promotion?,btohqsg

What if my deposit is much higher than withdrawal in a single month ie still net deposit? Is that allowed?,btohqsg
