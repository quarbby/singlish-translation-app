Becoz they got nothing to tax for petrol excise. Yes.,btohqsg
Becoz of the flat fee component which is to replace fuel excise duties,btohqsg
9% lol... Wonder what's the basis the comparison is made,btohqsg
No. BlueSG has artificial IC engine noise to warn pedestrians. EVs mostly silent but many make an artificial noise at slow speeds like in carparks.,btohqsg
Wonder what's the yearly mileage assumption they use in calculating,btohqsg

Motorcyclist takes a shortcut by going against the flow of traffic at a carpark and almost ends up in a head-on collision.React with...🤬: If you encountered a motorist that took a similar shortcut before🥰: If you think the Honda Civic should have given way🔥: If you think what the Honda Civic did was rightRead the full story👉🏻https://bit.ly/3CD0LXT,btohqsg
🤬 not just motorcyclists… cars as well,btohqsg
yep…I encountered a lorry that took a shortcut before🙃,btohqsg
Yea esp at bishan junction 8 carpark. Those coming up from b2 always shortcut n go against the one direction traffic instead of going one round,btohqsg
My opinion la  if government really wants to encourage adoption of EV  a seperated COE should be introduced. (Basic electric cars similar to BlueSG and luxury electric vehicle)Singapore isn't a big city  you technically do not need a sophisticated long range EV so long the charging infrastructure is there,btohqsg
The charging time is too long,btohqsg
Compared to going to petrol station to pump,btohqsg
U will see a lot of hoarders at Hdb charging point,btohqsg
Maybe should have chargers at MSCP washing bays too. Charge as we wash n wax. 😁. No time wasted. 😁😁,btohqsg
Use removable battery pack… pay for fully charged pack and drive off,btohqsg
just convert majority of season parking bays to have charging points,btohqsg
We have weatherproof power sockets for buildings so I believe it can be done for cars too. 😁😁,btohqsg
after that you can apply for season parking for EV,btohqsg
Hope they come out with wireless charging… just like how they charge us for erp,btohqsg
wireless charging lane on the road  charge as you drive,btohqsg
Solar charging… then no need to pay,btohqsg
I will buy ev  if they have solar charging,btohqsg
China had this. Just drive to the station n it will swop ur batteries. Even for electric bikes  just swop the fully charged batteries,btohqsg
So far only I've heard nio has been implementing this throughout china,btohqsg
But first we need more ev choices haha,btohqsg
Ya nio only  if this is implemented across all e ev den i sure buy sia.I find charging is such a hassle now.Imagine ppl charging there 30mins so i have to wait 30min for my turn and another 30min to charge?,btohqsg
If everyone is ev in e petrol stn  hw long we gonna wait sia.. if nearby dont have other chargers,btohqsg
Grass is greener on the other side 🥲,btohqsg
Time for your cars to drink up!,btohqsg

Those were the good old days🥲,btohqsg
Thank you for alerting us on the updated price@Christopher!😎,btohqsg
Thanks Bro. I nearly topped up today. Timely information 👍,btohqsg
Esso stations going to be crowded today,btohqsg
In fact  let's do a poll!,btohqsg
omg I just pumped at esso yesterday! 😭,btohqsg
Lucky i just pumped during wkend,btohqsg
Yup mostly are in malls charge and horde  and hybrid plug in can also Hog,btohqsg
I agree  not much choices for 7 seater EVs at the moment... Only say the BYD van like 7 seater 😅,btohqsg
Agreed. The current scheme for EV adoption is not even enticing enough for us to abandon petroleum cars . In fact  it seems more so they want us to give up on cars and take public transport for good.,btohqsg
Wonder if there’s any trial ev for one mth to try. Like to experience the ownershipOf ev and see whether its worth the change,btohqsg
There are some PIs offering rental of EVs up to 3 days. Those should be a good litmus test for patterns and lifestyle change to be expected.,btohqsg
