May I ask  for singsaver cc rewards  how long do I have to own the cc for before I can cancel it without any penalty.,btohqsg
depends on the clause too  i know citi  have to keep the card for 1 year. For my SC card  after using for i think 6 months  i cancelled the card and also got my reward. no penalty though,btohqsg
If you have uob one  the $420 shall be good for moving the tracker. 5% this month with 100k or 4% next month with $150k.You can also use multiple keywords to search chat history  it gives you better result.Eg. ‚ÄúInsurance card‚Äù‚ÄúInsurance card miles‚Äù‚ÄúInsurance cashback‚Äù,btohqsg

count to min spend but no bonus rebate,btohqsg
I thought today will get ocbc 360 interest but sadly not getting it yet ... wait.... ING...,btohqsg
I'm sorry but I meant no harm and I hope someone within this community will be able to assist me. I have 200k in savings and probably about 100k in high risks investments.Initially  I can get up to 800+ interest for UOB One. But since they cut the interest badly.. is there any better options?Also  I do not have salary.,btohqsg
I do have some opinions like OCBC 360.. but is there a better option out there?,btohqsg
How do you manage to get 800+ interest from uob one? Or is it uob one plus stash?,btohqsg
Oh . I put 100k in my spouse account,btohqsg
Without salary your best bet is 150k in UOB One for 4% + earmarking promo..,btohqsg
And another 100k in my own to fully ulitize it.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn  is the Moomoo 200k for 60 days worth ?,btohqsg
Unfortunately among high interest saving account only UOB 3% plus for 100k above can accept self transfer for salary credit purpose. OCBC require giro corporate account,btohqsg
No cashback. By right it also doesn‚Äôt count towards min spend of $600 but empirically it does count.,btohqsg
Yea I figured it out. But even with salary crediting.. they cannot match current UOB rate,btohqsg
You know Moomoo is investment and not saving account which means your capital is not guaranteed,btohqsg
Yes I'm aware. But I see cash plus never once fail. And even if it drop  moomoo will still compensate the losses for this campaign right?,btohqsg
That's why I'm seeking all the financial gurus here that can make money for you instead of working for money..,btohqsg
I will pull out what Mt said:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/173866,btohqsg
It guarantees the 6.8% interest only  not your capital for the promotion campaign,btohqsg
Melvyn  will you share your professional advice on how to maximize interests?,btohqsg
Hahahaha and their guarantee is not guaranteed one ü§°,btohqsg
The above statement on saving account vs investment still holds. Know the risk and read their tnc.,btohqsg
It all depends on your goals... Emergency fund? Spare cash?,btohqsg
23 more days to go before I say byebye to UOB,btohqsg
Inheritance for my children. I don't spend unnecessary but I wish to see them through Uni.,btohqsg
Years ago  I'm nothing. Don't even have $500. Then I got into an accident and was insured for $50k,btohqsg
So I try to grow my 50k.. to what I have now.,btohqsg
If your 200k is your emergency cash  then 150k in UOB one is still a good option considering it is easy to meet the requirement and you don‚Äôt need to worry about incremental MAB. The other 50k you can put in funds to earn 6-7% plus if you prepare to take some ups and downs. At least you not risking the whole 200k,btohqsg
And do you have emergency funds kept somewhere,btohqsg
This 200k will be low risk. I have a portion at high risk and it didn't go too well.. I sold off too fast.,btohqsg
I do . About 20k easily.,btohqsg
I invest in gold. I can sell for profit now but that's emergency funds.. so yah.. no need to sell yet.. hopefully won't have to.,btohqsg
It's different for UOB one credit card right? That one is higher cashback for UOB merchants. So contradictory,btohqsg
Long term you can look at index funds,btohqsg
I will check it out. Thanks Melvyn and Jeremy. You guys are very helpful.,btohqsg
Well I sure a few will suggest some options  so take your time to think through. Risk vs gains. It is always a delicate balancing act.,btohqsg
Index fund doesn't really have liquidity ya...,btohqsg
Yea. That's why I would like to know people opinions,btohqsg
In my financial lesson  I now know that patience pay off.. I regretted so many things I did. üò¢,btohqsg
My option I suggest is safe approach. You have some liquidity of 150k and 50k to invest in funds for some growth. I not that crazy aim for 8-10%.  At my age coming 50  i can‚Äôt afford it üòÇ,btohqsg
Don't say that la. Age is wisdom. It's something that younger generation don't understand.,btohqsg
If u control 2 humans. Do HSBC EGA for close to 4.6%pa for $360k.Discussed a few times. Go search in the chat.,btohqsg
