Many people watch the video. Good income,btohqsg
Actually those no backside car generally have strengthen rear ends. Don‚Äôt have to worry too much,btohqsg
Yes. They even accept no loan purchase. Which some people like. A lot of ad force loan. Pml is one,btohqsg
Have not been in that situation thankfully  but it‚Äôs occasionally at the back of the mind.,btohqsg
I think they need to ban key word ‚Äújackyloh‚Äù üòÇ,btohqsg
Filter words like WhatsApp with phone number,btohqsg
What‚Äôre you talking about?  It‚Äôs referring to wheel nuts versus wheel bolts,btohqsg
I noticed increasingly cars like Porsches are switching to the Japanese methods,btohqsg
Whereas bmw still follows their old ways. Using wheel bolts,btohqsg
i definitely prefer the japanese way! easier to guide wheel for me to tighten. if you change tires yourself you will know what i mean.,btohqsg
Vw is using normal nuts  bmw just being bmw lo,btohqsg
I dont see why people have to be shamed for this leh,btohqsg
Not that they are stealing or what,btohqsg
Cuz make them feel like cheapo in Malaysia‚Ä¶ trying to max out the cheap fuel‚Ä¶But the article also said that he was doing that for years in singapore too‚Ä¶ so i think it‚Äôs more to save the trip to the petrol station than saving money.,btohqsg
i see no issues so long they pump 97 ah,btohqsg
Its just human perspective  i also sometimes shake my car in Singapore to hit the minimum coupon spending amount,btohqsg
makes them look stupid. who in the world would do that,btohqsg
when doing this kind of silly thing clearly wont help,btohqsg
It would actually  but not practical.,btohqsg
you know wheel bolts versus wheel nuts? the diff,btohqsg
I know Mazda is the best,btohqsg
VW and BMW use wheel bolts. same,btohqsg
you are being juvenile here. i am talking objective here.,btohqsg
LOL says one who is being in denial,btohqsg
it is difficult to guide wheel to tighten when mounting.,btohqsg
Your house got mirror? When your birthday?,btohqsg
you are being childish this way,btohqsg
yes. a a pain when mounting wheel back. need a guide,btohqsg
because i do this manually often. when i saw tireman do he also has to do a few times to position the holes,btohqsg
Nah  just echoing your nonstop self praise of mazda,btohqsg
that is what i said same. but that guy says different,btohqsg
Anyway god bless you with your 2.5L mazda  its the best.. ciao,btohqsg
Maybe newer platofrm is different. This is from 50 years ago afterall.,btohqsg
notning to do with mazdA. this is wheel tightening methods used by nissan toyota mazda perodua japanese cars,btohqsg
The front disc brake is the size of Altis rear brakes. lol,btohqsg
you are being chilidsh and honestly stupid.,btohqsg
This one my experience not too good unless you run the soap rich,btohqsg
almost all the euro  cars are like that. makes mounting wheel back a pain.,btohqsg
$11‚Ä¶ I just buy and try,btohqsg
I read the reviews  like not bad,btohqsg
Dont expect the same foam bath you find in car wash shops can le.,btohqsg
I know  don‚Äôt have that expectation,btohqsg
The foam level is similar when you shower yourself.,btohqsg
i have this. brand is kartcher. i find it lousy. the bottle is too small. when used with the pressure jet  it finishes in no time,btohqsg
Do you have access to those hdb jets ?,btohqsg
This one not use with pressure jet. This one hand pump. Need hand job.,btohqsg
If you do buy those cheap attachments,btohqsg
But this one is bottle itself‚Ä¶ not the spray attachment,btohqsg
Works perfectly well and it‚Äôs small,btohqsg
yes/. hand pump. but i think after a while wont use anymore. because it is slow,btohqsg
