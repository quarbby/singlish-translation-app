Im curious why do many people talk about nus merit but not as much talk about ntu usp?,btohqsg
They seem somewhat equivalents of each other,btohqsg
u dont rly need 90 rp to get ntu usp,btohqsg
Is being in ntu usp cs better than being in nus cs without scholarship,btohqsg
all i can say is nus cs is on a whole different level as compared to ntu cs,btohqsg
Could you elaborate more? Im quite curious,btohqsg
since when can fishes be sad,btohqsg
the picture i only can send on tues,btohqsg
nus cs is a b.comp  ntu cs is a b.eng,btohqsg
my cap would have tanked big time if i was in cs this sem,btohqsg
already had an appetiser into how bad it can possibly be in GET1031,btohqsg
oh what's the format for GET1031,btohqsg
I need to find 2 UEs to do next sem,btohqsg
dear lord ok i'm avoiding it,btohqsg
cross my fingers I can get the CSCU GES,btohqsg
write about a problem in society that can possibly be addressed by computational thinking (5% of overall grade),btohqsg
write about a reflection on what you have learnt in GET1031(5% of overall grade),btohqsg
LOL i clearing all my GEMS asap,btohqsg
actually GEM you should spread them out to balance out workload,btohqsg
first time in my fkin life,btohqsg
i see 2 null hypothesis in a study,btohqsg
i alr cleared 2 this sem including ger,btohqsg
next sem prob preallocate geq and 1 UE to choose,btohqsg
yeah my 1st sem I clear GER and GES also,btohqsg
fast and furious is the way to go,btohqsg
i plan to go on internship in y2/y3,btohqsg
So for cs if one gets 90 rp but no leadership stuff  more or less is it cfm get in?,btohqsg
if I can secure the CSCU GES for my next sem  then I can effectively have a 3 CSCU sem :'),btohqsg
cause I still have 2 SUs,btohqsg
and i have 2 cores  3 UEs left to clear,btohqsg
Woah woah calm down calm down,btohqsg
man is already drowning in chemistry,btohqsg
I don't know if it is a good thing or a bad thing... NUS condenses comp arch into 1 module  NTU does it in 2. Same with data structures & algo  same with intro prog,btohqsg
dont drown me in further sorrows,btohqsg
cs1010s is phasing out memoization next sem,btohqsg
my 1010 didn't even have memoization,btohqsg
that's something i learnt in 3230 when formally learning dynamic programming,btohqsg
Why though do they teach different things 9r,btohqsg
content taught can be similar  but questions asked can be very different,btohqsg
but i've never seen ntu stuff before so i cannot comment,btohqsg
Does one focus on application and the other memorisation?,btohqsg
i don't think it is possible to memorise your way through any computing course sorry LOL,btohqsg
If you can do it go for it man memorising in cs,btohqsg
Still whats the main differencr beteeen ntu and nus cs,btohqsg
Lol I was just surprised u didn't know earlier,btohqsg
But the point of a scholarship is to attract people to the school,btohqsg
So think about the kind of ppl nus wants,btohqsg
Idk how people can give a good review of it tbh,btohqsg
It's not as though they sat through both degrees,btohqsg
Or how people give good comparison,btohqsg
