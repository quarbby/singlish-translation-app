Hi all  noob here.Which best single credit card strategy should I follow if I‚Äôm planning to go overseas and want to obtain miles and lower the foreign transactions fees?,btohqsg
Would an Instarem Amaze + Citi Rewards be fine?,btohqsg
yes as long as you don‚Äôt use it on MCCs such as (e.g.  travel (flights  hotels) and car rentals etc),btohqsg
Long time ago plan already  only disrupted by covid,btohqsg
Ah I see. Is it because there‚Äôs no benefit if you book travel  car rentals etc?,btohqsg
yup cause those are excluded from crmc rewards,btohqsg
Ok got it. Thanks for your reply!,btohqsg
Take note if you use this combo for local spend there is now a 1% fee for monthly local transactions above $1k,btohqsg
No charge. but if earn the 1% cc/dc/giro it‚Äôll deduct whatever u have  and deduction date is quite random. Unless u check everyday and transfer out everything,btohqsg
Actually researching more because I think my major short-term expenses would come from travel  flights etc and because I‚Äôm in Uni rn,btohqsg
Was thinking to go with DBS Altitude card. Is that a good choice? (No instarem anymore),btohqsg

Print form and fill up and mail it,btohqsg
There must also be signature record with the banks rightSo for credit card applications done online  there won't be any signature records and hence will need to head down to a branch to register my signature?,btohqsg
