healed fractures are never back to 100% original state. Best idea is not fracture it in the first place.otherwise strengthen the muscle around the bone is a good idea to prevent future injury.,btohqsg
recovered a month or 2 already. initially  even breathing will feel painful,btohqsg
Ya i understand that. Becoz of my kneecaps hurt and i know my legs are not strong  that why i did alot of leg strengthening. Esp muscles around my kneecaps. Sometimes it will have inflammation  it hurts to walk. That why now i am careful.,btohqsg
