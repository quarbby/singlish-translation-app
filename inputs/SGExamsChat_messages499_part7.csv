Do u like open book exams?,btohqsg
open book gives them more freedom to set fucked up questions,btohqsg
i mean it can feel more chill prep wise but idk,btohqsg
in one of my graduate mods we had an open book exam that was 2 hours  got extended by 50 mins and we still couldn’t finish,btohqsg
idc… end of the day it’s the Uni/work whos looking at ur grades fuck cares abt the stress u went thru,btohqsg
i’m saying people can like it because it can feel chill to prep for but then they aren’t prepared properly,btohqsg
for me  I think now…. I think… (iw my child to go ri),btohqsg
my friend study 1hr before exam also nvr get so low,btohqsg
honestly..i really felt i just did not treat y1 of poly seriously,btohqsg
but now im treating it more seriously now,btohqsg
that was for sem 1  now in sem 2 its 1.8+,btohqsg
i know i can score if i wanted to  you can see here...I got a B+ for ESE but Got a few D grades for class lessons,btohqsg
but the momment i hand in work late..it greatly affect the grades,btohqsg
need a lot of work some time gotta tank to save ur self,btohqsg
legit need consistent studying and need proper time management skills,btohqsg
I rmb sem 1 for one I grouped with slackers no choice I just do myself and present myself,btohqsg
im best friend with someone who got 3.6-3.8 in y1 in the same course as myself,btohqsg
I didn’t even get any directors list,btohqsg
He does very good notes  finishes his daily assignemnt in 2-4 hrs from the start of lesson...dont do pre-reading...then proceeds to play the rest of the day,btohqsg
he was on the director roll of honours,btohqsg
means confirm got some ppl with 4.0 with distinctions,btohqsg
i once tried to keep up with his pace..i literally could not,btohqsg
when I do my 25 study to 5 min break,btohqsg
He finished his Graded assignment project work within 2 weeks of release...The assignment had a deadline of 4 months,btohqsg
my 5 min break is 1 game of brawl stars or looking after my pets lol,btohqsg
i legit dont know how people study in rp...like what notes do they use to study from,btohqsg
ur sch nvr give notes meh?,btohqsg
rp has no text books...resources are locked until the day of lessons,btohqsg
but they are 2 yrs old...and are student's contributed,btohqsg
just write notes on paper lor....thats what i did also...,btohqsg
no notes make ur own notes...  cannot be poly spoon feed you....,btohqsg
cause in rp...they dont let you see the info you will learn until the very day of lesson,btohqsg
what ever the lecture video say  note down the impt points,btohqsg
what ever teacher teach   write down the impt pts lor,btohqsg
yea im alr doing that...but it gets confusing when the lessons are switched,btohqsg
the problem is...there is a possibility the content learn in eg. Lesson 4  is only taught in lesson 6,btohqsg
for my year...then the original lesson 6 is taught on lesson 2,btohqsg
i did the notes for what i can do alr,btohqsg
actl rn im still firing up,btohqsg
