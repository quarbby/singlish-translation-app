Ya it’s M3 competitor. Same space.,btohqsg
Kind of. 19” wheels but it has to have that big becoz of the weight. The whole car felt very heavy.,btohqsg
19” is good enough. Single motor is good enough too.,btohqsg
Volvo always make heavy cars haha,btohqsg
I would at the single motor long range is the best. But to add driver assistance features is 7.2k to top up from what you see at the price tag.,btohqsg
7.2k for the additional features? Does it worth that much? Its the upgraded brakes etc right,btohqsg
No no. It’s 7.2k for the driver assistance pack or pilot pack.. The upgraded brakes is called performance pack another top up of 16 000 which is only for the dual motor.For your reference._*COST OPTIONS*_1. Wall Box Charger - $5 0002. Upgrade from 19’ rims to 20’ rims - $2 3003. Nappa Leather with Ventilated Seats - $9 000- - - - -*Pilot Pack* - $7 200(only for Single Motors)1. LED front fog lamp2. 360 degree camera3.

Wall box charger doesnt work on hdb right lol,btohqsg
No.. only for landed private properties,btohqsg
I ever seen a unit at tiong bahru pull his cable down frm lvl 2 unit down to charge the tesla,btohqsg
For me the pilot pack is a must to get if you get a Polestar. Otherwise it’s barebones with no driver assistance tech is a bit dumb. To cost 227k.,btohqsg
I only need the 360cam. The rest pretty much useless for daily Driving,btohqsg
Blindspot monitoring shld come as standard for all cars.,btohqsg
I think no 3  4  5  6 and 8 are quite useful. Enough to justify the 7.2k.,btohqsg
Ya unfortunately it doesn’t. So this was the main reason I feel Polestar is out alr. Unless they can throw it in for free.,btohqsg
Haha  these are the options that i wont use and will Turn it off. Except 5,btohqsg
The current Avante I’m driving has these. It’s very good to help me avoid those hazardous drivers.,btohqsg
True.. but sometimes too much tech it takes over the joy of driving and i dont like to be too reliant on the tech too,btohqsg
there a 40-4k arf rebate when u purchase car  it straight deduction off the total car price,btohqsg
I’m paying $130/mth for fuel. Each tank 700-800km,btohqsg
So it possible $200/mth for fuel,btohqsg
Good mileage u have there. What model u’re on,btohqsg
I heard some people with same model can go up 1000km per tank. I Nvr manage to achieve tat,btohqsg
Alot of talks abt 3cyl cars.,btohqsg
Stock tire is 16”  I upgraded to 18”. Maybe tat explain the poor fc,btohqsg
Yes  higher vib. Idling at 950rpm.,btohqsg
Is it noisy? The taxi idling sound,btohqsg
Vib damper  belt and tensioner need to replace more often,btohqsg
For mine nope. Only cold start. After warm up it sound like typical BMW Eng noise,btohqsg
I also work in cbd  park at Tanjong pagar  then take mrt,btohqsg
Cheapest is marina sq season or chinatown point hdb parking,btohqsg
Or the road side parking at amoy area but open carpark i dont park. Lol,btohqsg
There was one period  Marina one had free parking at certain office hours,btohqsg
Tesla don’t have dealer margin like polestar and higher omv and got super charger network and better tech .If interior is an issue maybe try see the white seats that will make it way nicer   model y is coming soon also,btohqsg
Yes tesla is very good price as there is no dealer margin   look at the cheapest model 3 standard the omv is already at 60 k and that is like an e300,btohqsg
You can find the survey in our pinned msgs,btohqsg
Correct. With no dealer margin it’s considered good alr.,btohqsg
Yes as it is cheaper in terms of buying price   but with a higher omv   someDealer margin is higher then the omvJust look at the agent asking price vs the total basic costhttps://onemotoring.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/onemotoring/Buying/Car_Cost_Update/M032-Car_Cost_Update.pdf,btohqsg
Ya. Totally agree. I think if we do such homework more  we will make more informed choices.,btohqsg
If you are not staying in landed the package dealer give for ev is just pointless like free wall charger   that you can’t install   free servicing   that ev don’t have,btohqsg
Would taking the 5 year charging by Hyundai for example make sense then?,btohqsg
No super charging network   tesla is charging for free and the super charger is only for tesla   like water way point tesla got 3 charger and charge plus got 1Tesla can use charge plus charger but Hyundai can’t use tesla charger   and tesla charger is faster,btohqsg
So no matter what it still isn’t too attractive. To consider even other EV Brand’s.,btohqsg
Yes I got 500 kwh sp free charging tilll now I only use 200 after 3 month   as it is very tough to go to a specific charging location   there might be like 8 cars waiting infront of you,btohqsg
I see.. you are using Which EV at the moment?,btohqsg
Hopefully COE is more reasonable in time to come,btohqsg
Ioniq 5 shld be in cat b right,btohqsg
But I believe even after their 90 kWh < PR < 130 KWh rating it may be not be significantly reduced ya?Since battery capacity is the measure for road tax for EVs.,btohqsg
Ya Cat B. Becoz of the Power of about 137kW. The battery is about 58 KWH,btohqsg
110kw is only about 140bhp plus,btohqsg
