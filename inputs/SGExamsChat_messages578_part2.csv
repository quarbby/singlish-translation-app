If my o levels fr cmi,btohqsg
or their schedule change to y2,btohqsg
like i fr doubt they'd remove it bc it's so necessary for so long,btohqsg
maybe. i ask him if he is taking any programming mods  he said no. idk haha,btohqsg
tbh if u think u struggling in o lvl den no point go eng leh,btohqsg
the numbers gonna fk u up,btohqsg
like my faculty also recently changed their schedule and shifted the y1s1 coding mod to y1s2,btohqsg
to accommodate a lot of cc mods,btohqsg
but i tbh cannot think of any other courses tht interest me much,btohqsg
if u legit dk i think there is common engineering?,btohqsg
between civil  eee  envt  materials and mech,btohqsg

But isok i try my luck nxt yr,btohqsg
oh u all talking about poly nvm,btohqsg
even if xxx uni or xxx poly course not teaching coding  doesn't mean u don't need to learn. think about what employers will look for,btohqsg
from what i heard  nus all courses now has at least one programming mod except for the social sciences,btohqsg
most of the time u need self learn coz your course just give u basic stuff,btohqsg
unless u com sci or com eng,btohqsg
Y coding so important. I mean i cannot pinpoint the main importance,btohqsg
even social sciences. u won't keep your job in psych or econs if u can't code your stats model,btohqsg
in short it helps to shorten the workload required,btohqsg
Would it be reccomended to also learn excel,btohqsg
I feel like alot of jobs req to use excel also,btohqsg
So i feel like if i pick up rn i can at least save myself some time during poly,btohqsg
gonna be useful when u writing reports,btohqsg
"there is even a ""microsoft excel world championship""",btohqsg
Im so glad i found this chat grp sia everytime i open and ask stuff i learn sth,btohqsg

But right its so shit. Rn the hige broken. I send repair also no use same thing happen so its like stationary on my table. It runs so slow i cld say my grandmother can function faster,btohqsg
and idk how to fix the issue,btohqsg
