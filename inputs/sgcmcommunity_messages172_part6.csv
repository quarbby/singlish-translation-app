The only anomaly is BMW. First 5 years keep claiming warranty but people still keep buying,btohqsg
How abt 2009 c180? Can buy? üòÅ,btohqsg
Because sheer driving pleasure. Amongst the 3 Germans  bmw offers the best driving feel. Reliability is Heng suay.,btohqsg
90% of singaporeans who buy bmw don't care about driving pleasure... brand more important,btohqsg
If brand  merc is more prestigious.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why so many glb and glc on the road,btohqsg
No need. 116 or a180 both have the badge can liao already better than Camry or Mazda 6 etc,btohqsg
Ya but ride quality is like crap,btohqsg
I think 2 years ago there was Peugeot 508 fastback,btohqsg
Can buy any car you want,btohqsg
Just that some require more maintenance than other cars,btohqsg
You find someone willing to sell you,btohqsg
Sir.. I want GT3rs.. wissach pack .. can ?,btohqsg
can. you order and pay the downpayment i will pay the rest,btohqsg
wow amazing! Not only did you score an ultra rare car  you even managed to get it approved in singapore despite it being left hand drive!!! You guys are amazing!!!,btohqsg
do share your secrets with us!! Is lee hsien loong your friend? Did you bribe someone at LTA? Do tell,btohqsg
Might be seeing aggressive bidding alr,btohqsg
But car sharing also increases probability and risks of accidents considering the fact that the occasional driver would have access to car more easily and probably would care less too ü§î,btohqsg
I mean  consider the amount of accidents involving a getgo,btohqsg
Seeing how most getgos are so banged up,btohqsg
Maybe need ruling of only those who live in property costing 5 million and above can own car. The rest of cars all convert to car sharing.,btohqsg
Some ppl like seeing a revolution,btohqsg
The article is from getgo perspective...car sharing boss won't say its better to own a car üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Car owning is not only costs factor  other factors also e.g. independence  privacy etc. If cost is the only factor  the person won't even buy car in the first place. So there's nothing new in such article,btohqsg
So glad you're not the policymaker,btohqsg
Renters not seasoned driver  car type is always different and requires different estimation and judgement  rookies where got the skill?? The only skills they have is blaming others,btohqsg
Maybe if masses move to mopeds,btohqsg
Cars don't make much sense liao,btohqsg
Some ulu places really more accessible with cars,btohqsg
Cuzco u don't stay in a property with more then 5mill,btohqsg
About this scenario  if you overtake at 120kmh at lane 1 cause all the lane 2 vehicles maintaining at 90. And you continue all the way for a long stretch at 110 120 kmh cause...for u to slot back into lane 2 u have to slow down to 90. Are you illegally speeding?,btohqsg
Or high speeds are excusable cause you are in theory overtaking from say whiteley road to tampines exit,btohqsg
So u shld b doing 90 at lane 2 also,btohqsg
But pple think they driving to overtake so can go 100 110 on lane 1,btohqsg
So if TP at lane 2 on 90  u gg to speed up to overtake?,btohqsg
Or tp on 90 at lane 1  u gg to high beam n tail him?,btohqsg
If you're going at 100 to overtake I think tp will just close one eye,btohqsg
They will on blinker n pull u over,btohqsg
Means ideally lane 1 shld be empty. Lane 2 shld be 80 to 90. Lane 1 shld only use for overtake at max 90kmh speed. Then form back up in lane 2 at 80kmh.,btohqsg
But I challenge you to try to high beam and tailgate tp,btohqsg
Remember to share your dashcam footage,btohqsg
1sr qn they asked me was what's the speed limit,btohqsg
Some of those foreign Sohai will do this. Proud ego,btohqsg
Then he asked me  and then?,btohqsg
Wah they sia lan ask and then....,btohqsg
U do wrong u still yaya meh,btohqsg
Hehe only they got power to yaya,btohqsg
Show me radar reading. Kana at 96,btohqsg
Thts a demerit pt + fine,btohqsg
U kana overhead bridge sniper also will receive love letter,btohqsg
