The slot for mile redemption flight also no v gd. N have to book in mnths in advance.  Travel alone ok la travel with friends hard to plan,btohqsg
I see  so I guess I shall continue w my cash back lol though keep hearing ppl used miles to fly business class like shiok,btohqsg
Currently using Citi cash back  minimum spending $800 per month,btohqsg
Past few months manage to get $60 to $80 cash back,btohqsg
Nope  not sure is plus better as mostly use for restaurants,btohqsg
But if canâ€™t hit $800 spending then the cash back very little lol,btohqsg
Same for groceries/fnbSheng shiong use everydayTransport grab/uob absolute may change to everydayFrank card for online and paywave.Others grabcard/absoluteMay consider use back uobone if I can gauge that I can spend 500 to each each mnth.,btohqsg
Me amex for most purchase & scb smart busWait for uob one so slow maybe looking at dbs posb or ocbc 360,btohqsg
Amex pay got $1 Cashback when u use amex pay for SGQR,btohqsg
Depends on you acc u may bi see in app to activate it,btohqsg
Quite Damm good $1 off when u SGQR,btohqsg
Is $60-80 monthly cash back too little or still ok?Too bad already have Citi card.. now Seedly promo for the card so many good deals haha,btohqsg
How much do u spend usually in a month,btohqsg
Lol bro  $100 also below $3k hahaha,btohqsg
I'm stiol thinking posb everyday / dbs live/ ocbc 360 since uob one take own Sweet time to process,btohqsg
One thing not good about Citi is canâ€™t accumulate lol.. every month will auto approve the cash back amount back to your own card,btohqsg
why transport change to everyday? Frank nerfed  online+mobile contactless combined $25 max.,btohqsg
Lol accumulate more then can offset one shot one month spending,btohqsg
haha  dun make sense for money to be stuck in between without interest la,btohqsg
Posb everyday card. 5 percent no minimum spend req,btohqsg
what do y'all think abt this?https://www.tigerbrokers.com.sg/market/maturity-fund?lang=en_US#register,btohqsg
I was looking at this too! Anyone is doing this? Iâ€™ll need to sign up for tiger too  any referral links I can use?,btohqsg
locked 1 year not good. Now HSBC EGA/OCBC 360 already almost that rate,btohqsg
Anybody here applied T bills using SRS. Need some quick clarification. Does the DCS (Direct crediting service ) of CDP account necessarily to be SRS account or savings account is fine ? With DBS  I have two account (1) savings account (2) SRS Account. My CDP DCS is linked to my savings account. For the first time Iâ€™m planning to apply for T bills using fund in SRS account. If I understand correctly  during the auction date  I will get funds back to my account depending on rate . Does it requires DCS of CDP account or the SRS account is enough? Sorry for noob question. Newbie here. TIA,btohqsg
it's locked for 3 years ðŸ˜‚ in case the int goes down in 3rd year or so,btohqsg
its *UP TO*... which means it could be 1-2% only if any black swan event were to happen,btohqsg
4.71% not guaranteed for 3 years right ?,btohqsg
i think right now FED keep increasing every several months  so better not commit any long term locked deposit.,btohqsg
true~ that's why still on the fence hmmm,btohqsg
I think I will just apply OCBC 360 and keep in that account. Going to change from DBS Multiplier and monitor how it goes,btohqsg
Saw many people got fixed deposit  rate increase and keep taking out,btohqsg
Not awaiting for UOB to join the fray?,btohqsg
End up lose all the earned rate,btohqsg
A bit hard to hit the UOB one card criteria haha,btohqsg
FD if take out no interest and pay penalty right ?,btohqsg
At least OCBC 360 no need to spend and can earn 3.2%,btohqsg
Is ocbc 360 better than DBS multiplier?,btohqsg
For my tier (salary + credit card + mortgage loan)  only 2.1% after the increase,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why thinking of changing to OCBC 360,btohqsg
Salary + Save 500 = 3.2% already ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Or is there any better saving accounts out there?,btohqsg
if want HSBC EGA can get 4.9% 3.9% 3.9% 3.9% for 4 months.,btohqsg
sorry  anyone used Frank OCBC debit card  any way to get 5 eligible transactions in easiest without spending money?Does topping up grab count,btohqsg
It stops after 4months? Whatâ€™s the interest thereafter?,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s great.Just that I do not spend a minimum of $500 for ocbc credit card,btohqsg
I see. I checked their website and it is so confusing to understand haha. So far they debit the money in on time? Saw in Hardwarezone forum so many complaint,btohqsg
after 4 months  move out to ocbc first before join following month (if rate is good),btohqsg
Oh not spend. Is the daily average balance need to increase 500 for each month,btohqsg
Not going to get OCBC credit card. Have too many cards on hand lol,btohqsg
because their reference month always month prior (for example for nov-feb  referencr month is oct),btohqsg
