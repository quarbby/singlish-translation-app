Dude  that's a client. The clients are not illegal  it's typically the websites that host the torrent files which are illegal.,btohqsg
Wish we can turn back time,btohqsg
Wait  so the only ethical website right now which utilises torrent is the Ubuntu website?,btohqsg
$ curl https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.10/ubuntu-20.10-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent?_ga=2.215539088.661033949.1615733924-1461280613.1573013163 --output download && file download% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  CurrentDload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed100  219k  100  219k    0     0   106k      0  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--  106kdownload: BitTorrent file,btohqsg
i'm providing an example of a legitimate site that has a legitimate use for torrents,btohqsg
Oh  are they any more examples?,btohqsg
i'm sure if you look around  servers that host downloads may have a torrent counterpart as well,btohqsg
Thank you! Didn't know Ubuntu uses Torrent as a way to download their kernel.,btohqsg
it's just another file sharing method  but of course the decentralised nature of it makes it a good choice for illegal resources to be shared via it,btohqsg
but i mean lots of illegal resources are also shared using the cloud like mega or google drive so it's not just torrents doing all the dirty work,btohqsg
Jiang Ying is my good friend,btohqsg

the one i had was not compatible w the specs i required and it was just not practical to bring it to sch cuz it was big and heavy and dying. so it's rly up to u  if the one you have is working just fine and there aren't any problems with it and u don't require a specific laptop for your course  then don't buy a new one,btohqsg
