Because. Here everyone drive different cars and styles.  Some go for special aftermarket pads some more,btohqsg
My current issues  i change my front pad at yr 2019 and then i change my rear pad in 2022,btohqsg
Yes we all learning from you sir. THE VS Angel in SGCM and some say Batam.,btohqsg
Now morning  i brake got sound coming from the brake,btohqsg
At what mileage did you change fronts?,btohqsg
90% of braking comes from your front. If you change in 2019  about time to change,btohqsg
You go ask workshop about the sound and try to replicate,btohqsg
oh jb cannot already. JB volvos all so fierce,btohqsg
Cause brake sound not only from brake pads,btohqsg
Can be issues with brake lines also,btohqsg
Still can. You will still be Number One. Because you are Volvo Singapore Angel.,btohqsg
And after parking at office  evenings drive off. Also braking got screeching sound,btohqsg
Yes so follow that range 56k to 64k ish,btohqsg
if got issue go mechanic and check again,btohqsg
Ok will go back to the workshop,btohqsg
It is likely that your brake pads never bed in properly,btohqsg
If people ask you put WD40  don’t listen to them 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Or your rotors got uneven wear so a bit,btohqsg
Check before changing pads how much life you have as well,btohqsg
Then need to change rotors or something,btohqsg
imagine ur brakeline burst😂😂look ma  no brakes!,btohqsg
With that mileage likely low life remaining. Like me.,btohqsg
I'm guessing if 45k done alr,btohqsg
Mr ong  if you end up having to change rotors  change brake pads together one shot,btohqsg
Then bed in properly for optimum performance,btohqsg
Don’t worry we all learning too,btohqsg
I got a regular work shop,btohqsg
Everyone learning till they go six feet under,btohqsg
Can repair instead of replace a lot,btohqsg
Old school ones are good for general mechanical wear and tear items for sure!,btohqsg
They told me my front brake pad still can last 2 service,btohqsg
Take a look at it yourself,btohqsg
They dont up sell thats why i go to them,btohqsg
Better than those “screeching sound? Change pads  rotors  calipers and brake line”,btohqsg
The sound is loud  my cabin also can hear,btohqsg
Question: are these original installed from Toyota? If aftermarket  any reason behind the choice?,btohqsg
The workshop recommends this to me,btohqsg
At the point of time my rear pad aready less than 15%,btohqsg
No guru. Just working on being less “gundu” 😁 rest welll too sir!,btohqsg
Got dust? Go petrol station and use the air pump to clear,btohqsg
Anyone know Where to buy skoda kodiaq wiper ?,btohqsg
Might be slightly cheaper than avantage,btohqsg
