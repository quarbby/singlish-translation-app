Alset difficult to pass 10 if no positive news as Ah Chan is holding tonnes of warrants convertible at 4 and 4.8 cts. Abt 1.5b warrants I think.,btohqsg
Previously the price drop from 14cts mainly due to his conversion n disposal. But when price drop to 6cts  he buy again.,btohqsg

In Olden times everything outside of understanding is attributed to spirits and godsWhich only shaman can ‚Äòcommunicate‚Äô with themWhen they know none the better. Just pretend they doSimilar to some cheerleaders now. Talk with confidence and influence people into believing their blind faithWhen they know none the better.Hence I call them shaman of the past,btohqsg

But why is aem remove from Singapore,btohqsg
Regarding the MSCI inclusions/deletions  there are different categories. AEM is removed from the microcap category but being included into the small cap category. YZJ is removed from the standard category but being added into the small cap category. Medtecs is being included in the small cap category  together with AEM and YZJ.,btohqsg
