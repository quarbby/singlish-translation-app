You pay a let's say 30% of the price of the car. Then monthly you say the remaining depends on how long you loan,btohqsg
But here comes with a down side  there are intrest,btohqsg
So in the end you are paying more than the actual price,btohqsg
If you are rich enough just pay full,btohqsg
Rarely will dealer let u pay full,btohqsg
Cos they cannot earn from interest,btohqsg
But whatever it is  don't go for $0 down-payment or $0 driveway,btohqsg
For sure  especially for cars with low paper value,btohqsg
Like those fd2r 20k depre shit,btohqsg
Some will just mark up slightly,btohqsg

Ya lo. At least this one wire no jap sala.,btohqsg
We all likes cars but in the wrong country.If Malaysia or else where car will be still around,btohqsg
any recomendation where to change brakes,btohqsg
For me I went toThe brake shopI going there soon for Overhual brake,btohqsg
And remember if changing BBK or SSBH pls change all 4Many would advise only change front can liao which is wrong,btohqsg
why need change all 4 leh,btohqsg
i also heard many for longest time say change front can alr,btohqsg
SSBH change all 4 bah. Bbk usually front enough. But obviously dont do F6R1 pot haha,btohqsg
4/1 is fine for most applications. Also make sure its compatible with your brake master cylinder.,btohqsg
When u press on the brake pump the pressure is distributed to 4 wheels if only change front the stress pressure will go to the rear and the efficiency drops,btohqsg
Coz rear is still rubber hose,btohqsg
BBK front ok more then enough. If wan more balance just change the pads for the rear so when u brake hard the rear help to maintain balance,btohqsg
Correct hahah. But again dont do 6pot f and 1 pot r AHHAHA,btohqsg
Go see the Mercedes AMG GT pro,btohqsg
But bias from factory is perfect already,btohqsg
This guy one of the most professional locally imo,btohqsg
See the brakes if you get the chance haha the rear is super small,btohqsg

Give u quattro also no use,btohqsg
Wanna play  carros outside all the way to limchukang can play,btohqsg
I kena wheel spin b4 ma,btohqsg
They say he was test driving,btohqsg
If is test drive  is claim dealer insurance? or he ownself pay,btohqsg
So from the testing  looks like the car not good,btohqsg
Maybe dealer civil suit and claim back from tester,btohqsg
Wah then the dealer premiums up,btohqsg
Waiver means? All responsibility on driver?,btohqsg
but if you test driver you no insurance,btohqsg
oh yeah.. last time i buy from direct owner,btohqsg
if dealer skip this step.. gg lo,btohqsg
went with my bro to timah's dealer  didnt sign but test drove anw,btohqsg
most of the time dealer will skip,btohqsg
but most of the time that fella wont expect you to just step also,btohqsg
haha step also not indoors la..,btohqsg
i got ask MG dealer permission before step,btohqsg
carros outside so many empty roads,btohqsg
you drive further you reach 40T,btohqsg
most likely is dealer have to claim insurance first,btohqsg
the car belongs to who  that entity have the responsibility,btohqsg
after that  the dealer wanna fight and claim the driver or what  is another thing. Most likely,btohqsg
but also have to see the insurance. Sometimes the insurance nv cover unauthorised drivers. Then die.,btohqsg
duno is it same car haha,btohqsg
maybe is buy alr then go there do car,btohqsg
Hahaha at least that's on his insurance,btohqsg
Sia la this audi i saw kenna towing towards kakibukit on pie just now,btohqsg
I thought some highway accident then kenna tow,btohqsg
his quattro maybe cannot fight your 4WD,btohqsg
He was going too fast into the corner,btohqsg
i think the fact that he thinks inside buildings good place to play,btohqsg
He thought his missufiring system will work on the corners üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
He thought got gutter can put his tyres inside,btohqsg
Instead now his crash video become d√©j√† vu,btohqsg
But still dont make sense why from carros to kakibukit,btohqsg
After he crash  he know it's the time to go,btohqsg
"For sure the words ""it was at this moment  he knew he fucked up..."" Played in his head just before the crash",btohqsg
test driving nice to crash anot,btohqsg
