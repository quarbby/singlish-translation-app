hmm my pri sch cher apparently watchedchild porn,btohqsg
he went jail then come out alr,btohqsg
I mean it's a quote from a comedian but it is a great commentary of our current situation,btohqsg
I think this shows more of your character and ideals than mine.,btohqsg
He did not go jail then,btohqsg
You don't go jail and come out  he likely went rehabilitation,btohqsg
actual pedos tend to want to work at child centered places,btohqsg
ngl idk what the police is doing abt rape cases,btohqsg
My sch had a pretty famous casr,btohqsg
see this is why i fucking hate false rape accusers like mine,btohqsg
the teacher was called down in 2018,btohqsg
actly he was one of the nicest cher,btohqsg
until now is not settled yet,btohqsg
Hes still not charged and roaming free,btohqsg
my first reaction when i see this is how many of them r fucking cap and how many of them r legit,btohqsg
I thought family members cases would be higher,btohqsg
which is ass to the actual victims,btohqsg
what even was this match üíÄ,btohqsg
i ran into the teacher recently,btohqsg
Because on the outlook of the world  only 10% of actual perps of these crimes are committed by strangers a overwhelming majority are committed by family members or friends,btohqsg
but yea the moves a bit üíÄ,btohqsg
Dw he ain't going far  he is tagged by interpol,btohqsg
pein my chem cher always dam stingy with giving ws for revision lol,btohqsg
he used to tell us jokes in class  who knew he was doing this kind of thing secretly,btohqsg
This redditor sums up why his sentence was so light,btohqsg
u actly went to dig for it,btohqsg
That was never proven in court so there's that,btohqsg
You able to describe what he did?,btohqsg
No cuz I know it was just a case,btohqsg
Someone sent the link to his court hearing in our class grp chat,btohqsg
Q funny tho I rmbr he got interrogated in end 2018 then in 2019 he went Japan with his girlfriend,btohqsg
I guess it‚Äôs innocent till proven guilty and moe didn‚Äôt see any concrete evidence  so they never suspend him yet,btohqsg
I kind of want to see it,btohqsg
So he's just working outside I think,btohqsg
Ik he started his own business in 2019,btohqsg
Oh lol I thought you meant you ran into him in sch,btohqsg
A stingy teacher just wanting to get their end month salary...no surprise,btohqsg
The cops have a backlog of cases and they are not able to address every case in sufficient time,btohqsg
i wldnt say shes like that bad  just always dont give alot of practice material,btohqsg
Tbf its probably not serious enough,btohqsg
I think from the most recent article I read abt that case,btohqsg
They have to prioritize  for every case of a indecent exposure  there is one that is a serial one. For every sexual deviant  there is a serial one.They have to piriotise many factors including likelihood of bring caught vs harm to society over time,btohqsg
Isnt this why they don't do anything abt all the drug abuse cases,btohqsg
I think I talked to my fren abt it before they said it's not major enough to care abt,btohqsg
Many personel that have been involved in the industry of handling sexual crimes etc have noted. Most that do end up getting charged are not one time wonders  they are serial offendersThe one time wonders are given counselling and rehabilitation,btohqsg
Yep cause as we speak  there are about 2 or 3 drug kingpins in sg,btohqsg
üò∞ A girl  12  was hit by a car at a zebra crossing near a Bukit Batok school.This was despite a traffic warden signalling at the car to slow down.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/4aHdd9iFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
The girl ran across the road,btohqsg
And the small everyday dosage from the regular civilian will never ever do as much harm as these drug kingpins,btohqsg
I like my woman like I like my wine  12 years old and locked in a basement.,btohqsg
