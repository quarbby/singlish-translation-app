Same tactic  always last min push down,btohqsg
You can eat slipper rice.  Hahaha,btohqsg
MT tomorrow will gap up or down,btohqsg
What is the reason for this sharp drop other than shortlist attack? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Actually MT shorting hasnt been that much even during the drop to 0.97 last time,btohqsg
BBs flush and press down price,btohqsg
MT closed 112  tmr really depend on sentiment,btohqsg
Just fold and come back see in 2nd wk of october,btohqsg

No eye see liao... tonight I go US side better...see my Tesla...,btohqsg
Vp more contras in next 2 days,btohqsg

No reason but drop no need panic,btohqsg
Buy should see the sell column?,btohqsg
Think for medical stock have to be careful n dyodd,btohqsg
sell vol is the buy up. vice versa,btohqsg
I'm also vested in MT... Just waiting for them to announce the result for price correction,btohqsg
Curious is it really BB or shortist,btohqsg
Or the BB is the shortist,btohqsg
BB can earn both ways lah. It is probably a few BB acting in tandem,btohqsg
if 1 day  MT flush to 60 cent  then back to 1.20who would be happy?those who bought near the low of courseThose at the high will either avg down (if got so much ammo)or those who sold and bought back additional quantity when go downif every drop is attributed to bb and shortist  where will be the triggering point to come to self-realisationmaybe is real shit comingu would be like 70% or more down by then,btohqsg
know where is your threshold  stick to it. nobody say bb or shortist cant kill ujust buying that insurance IF there is really something wrong with the company?never say never,btohqsg
blind faith should only bring u so far  not to make u oblivious to everything else,btohqsg
MT is the perfect stock to play. Good retailers interest  good floating volume and very quiet passive management team.,btohqsg
MT is the best Medical stock right now,btohqsg
Too attractive for shortlists and contra players and BB,btohqsg
I don't think anybody doubts the fundamentals.,btohqsg
Best strategy seems like follow the price and sell when go up and wait. It will sure come down again. Really predictable action. Same pattern over and over.,btohqsg
I cant wait for them to release their result,btohqsg
Will be a shocking till they can do so much charity,btohqsg
Dun think faith is applicable in any exchange as they are all gambling dens.... Only thing we are doing is really to increase our chances of winning through our analysis...,btohqsg
My favourite JT also down ðŸ˜µ,btohqsg
"in case i need to repeat againby no means i am throwing stones at MT be it management or fundamentalswhat i said applies to any stock  afterall all dead stocks don't appear dead from day 1. be it the old days S-chips or noble and even midas. nobody is born dead  it excites crowd and attract investors because the story is simply too sexy to ignore. all look like idiotproof investments till time proven otherwise. different theme  same methodologyreference to medicals  the sentiment is the same like any other in the pastthis time it is differenti am just advocating some form of insurance or tail-end risk in the event your investment goes wrong.waiting for financial results to tell u something is wrong  usually share price has reacted way before that. an example would be vicplas  why the big drop from 60s to 30s.... then a crappy result appeared. the rest is historyunless u have a really big buffer to endure the price swings  it would be most advisable to have a stop loss be it how much faith you have in the company. everyday blaming on shortist and bb has no point  why doesn't it occur to you they might really know something you don't?if something is soooooooo good why are there showing weakness and so much selling from time to time?of course it could be the bb or shortist as many claimed. single digit PE  high profits  better 2H  covid still serious in many places etc. all these are public  you can read  anyone else can read it. only they stupid to sell and you are the smartest around to be buyingas the old saying goes... if you feel everyone is stupid  there is a high likelihood you are the stupid onesgive people especially market more credit than you give yourself.it could be a false alarm for sure. however as the process repeats  the probability of hitting that tail-end (impossible) occurrence increases over time. For many  all you need is that 1 time to wipe you outby all means  medtecs is not a cheap stock. 20-30 lots cost 20-30k capital  many holding much more than that and for sure  nobody expect to write it off and in all likelihood  most cannot suffer a complete writeoff  not even 50%. all looks at upside believing there is no downside.sad to say  there is nothing called ""no downside"" in the market. your imagination stands behind market reality.how many is really in the money for medtecs as of now? of course there are some who bought 10-20 cent and in deep profits but they are however the minority. mostly are sold to the covid idea and of course 9103 pricing and hugging a paper loss  perhaps so huge you need fellow stuckist to give encouragement to believe tomorrow is better. not sure how helpful it is  depicted by herding instinct. 1 herd of sheep feels safe but when wolf comes  none is safe. the slowest one gets eaten  no sheep is there to help. only in stock market when something goes wrong  it's a bigger herd of wolves and none shall survive  like it or not. reality of the market.could go on and on but the post is long enough to bring the point across.",btohqsg
