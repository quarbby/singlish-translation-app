PPV (mobile contactless) or Amaze + CRMC,btohqsg
hi experts  is the MCC different when we top up value in our coffee bean card vs when we paywave on our purchase at coffee bean?,btohqsg
PPV is UOB preferred platinum visa  right? Next month I have Q&M dental fee around 1000SGD  plan use CRMC+AMAZE  but if PPV can get 4MPD  I will use this one  thanks so much.,btohqsg
Correct. Alternative would be UOB Visa Signature,btohqsg

Lady's Card travel as 12X category,btohqsg

Thanks! Was taking a look at the hsbc revolution too. Is that good?,btohqsg
Is good but since it's a visa card  it can't be linked with Amaze,btohqsg
Hi  mcc for simplygo is 4111 right? Seems like it is qualify for 10x reward,btohqsg
Simplygo is commonly excluded from eligibility for miles or cashback for all citibanks card other than citi SMRT sir,btohqsg
Actually the exclusion is on the merchant level (BUS/MRT*) right? So if you use Amaze to change the merchant to AMAZE*  won't it get 4 mpd?,btohqsg
Afaik  Citi SMRT requires the transaction to be BUS/MRT*ANDMCC 4111. So likely you try to add in AMAZE* BUS/MRT* won't work cos they might check MCC too.,btohqsg
I know. I'm saying trying to use AMAZE* to circumvent the BUS/MRT* check might not be applicable for CRMC and other Citi MCs,btohqsg
Amaze still retains the mcc right since it just acts as pass through? Which means as long as itâ€™s SimplyGo  it wouldnâ€™t be eligible even if you use amaze,btohqsg
Hi wanna check for krispay miles earn though krispay after i transfer to krisflyer how long does it last? 6 months or 3 years?,btohqsg

Is it better than the bank time deposit  I donâ€™t plan to use some of my savings that I currently have,btohqsg
The top few ones giving around 3.9% interest. If u really not planning to use the money  can consider ssb about 3.5% this month  3.15% next month,btohqsg
Lock in the high yield for longer period,btohqsg
Ah from what I know ssb is 10 years  if I wanted like 4/5 years and withdraw will there be any fee or penalty,btohqsg
No penalty. Only thing is u can only get back money next month,btohqsg

First time using SC smart card  if spend on other expenses like retails  food Court  will there be point?,btohqsg
Min points but refer  to TNC,btohqsg
Smart is more for simply go and fast food and on-line subscription,btohqsg
Other get crap point better use other card if u want to use for food court,btohqsg
To add on  if your draw to SC Smart is no min spend and no fees  just use HSBC revo for food court and retail for 4 MPD or 2.5% cashback,btohqsg
No hope Lia the Last bastions already gone after amex tcb is done,btohqsg
