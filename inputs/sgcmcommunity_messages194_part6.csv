Got improper way meh  i see tiktok mechanics like all drain the same way.,btohqsg
The most thorough way is use suction to suck out,btohqsg
But draining through the plug is fine... the leftover little bit mix with new oil no issues at all,btohqsg
By right lah  AD will suck it out. Outside mech usually just open and let it flow out.,btohqsg
Yeap outside does it this way,btohqsg
Best car ever for family use😂😂,btohqsg
that's what they say. when they have heavy volume you think they have the time?,btohqsg
Wah I remember at Borneo motors do an oil change servicing can take a whole day  compared to outside within an hr or 2 lolz doesn't matter many cars or no cars  so unless we get to watch  otherwise we can only assume 🤭,btohqsg
Then those installed Liao go back do again? Lol,btohqsg
Like i say lo by right and by left. Whether or not they follow manual is another qn,btohqsg
See if can shift ownself 🤣🤣 just kidding ah try pecah dun find me,btohqsg
