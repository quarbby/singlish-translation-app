i cant seem to understand what my teacher says in class   not gonna lie about 3/4 the class fail chem in tests& exams lol   i also lack  motivation to study chem nor do i have the attention span to read my textbook,btohqsg
my teacher sort of gave up on my class alr so i really dk what to do   especially when sch is starting in a week,btohqsg
"I dont think the main problem is the teacher (although thats a contributing factor)  but rather your ""lack of motivation and attention span""",btohqsg
So even if you go for tuition  you might see improvements  but it may not be that much if you do not address these main problems,btohqsg
I think the main problem is students or tutors often didnâ€™t manage to troubleshoot the key issue,btohqsg
