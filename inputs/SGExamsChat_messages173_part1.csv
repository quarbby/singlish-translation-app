I got another exam grp they say leave exact,btohqsg
dont leave exact for final ans,btohqsg
If cant express in fraction then leave in?,btohqsg
For e math ik dun leave exact,btohqsg
Like if it’s sqrt or pi,btohqsg
Why don’t you just tell your sqn that ‘h7methstudent’ is ur callsign,btohqsg
What's the benefit of taking MOE H3 math?,btohqsg
Primarily  H3s are for you to pursue an interest,btohqsg
So from H3  you’ll know whether or not you would do maths in uni,btohqsg
And scholarship and unis look better at H3 kids  but locally rank point trumps all,btohqsg
If you want Cambridge  they also take a H3 merit as a H2 distinction,btohqsg
Guys remember for Bearings. If answer is only 2 digits. Then put a 0 behind it,btohqsg
Answer to Nearest cent$23.555 = $23.56,btohqsg
Answer to Nearest Ten Cents$23.555 = $23.60,btohqsg
Standard form qn might ask you to express answer in Millions. So cannot put × 10^6,btohqsg
when writing answers for the 1cm : 3km^2 type of qns  rmb to leave in exact if it is less than 5 digit  if more than 5 digits put 3sf but other qns if nvr state to leave in 2dp or wtv  leave it in 3sf. degrees also leave in 1d.p. unless they state to leave in 3sf or 2d.p,btohqsg
For every graph/line drawing also rmb to write down the graph equation,btohqsg
they wont test angle bisector construction right,btohqsg
Dont spend too much time on Graph also,btohqsg
ok so i want to ask  when im finding the equation of a straight line  if i sub the coordinates on the top of the line into the equation i get the answer,btohqsg
but if i sub the bottom one its wrong,btohqsg
Wht is the qn looking fot,btohqsg
usually u can use any point on the same line but gradient need to be same,btohqsg
i took two random coordinates to find the gradient,btohqsg
but when i sub the coordinate at the top into the y=mx+c i get the answer,btohqsg
the bottom coordinates doesn't give me the answer,btohqsg
Ur two coordinates are (0 6) and (1.2 0) Find gradient  first,btohqsg
Write down the equation y=mx+c with your gradient inside,btohqsg
Then sub in any of the 2 coordinates,btohqsg
i thought can use any coordinate,btohqsg
hmm maybe i do wrongly  i try again,btohqsg
IMO  the biggest benefit of H3 is for applying to UK universities  because it doesn't count towards rankpoints anyway,btohqsg
So basically u know C is Y int of line right?,btohqsg
The line intersects y axis at 6,btohqsg
Therefore making ur eqn of the line y=-5x+6,btohqsg
ohh but i still need find the gradient first right,btohqsg
When u sub in coordinates into the eqn it is to find the other coordinates if im not wrong,btohqsg
But in this case u alr know both coordinates,btohqsg
Oh ya also rmb this.1. When 2 lines are parallel  gradient of both lines are the same2. When 2 lines are overlapping and parallel  equation and gradient is the same3. If 2 lines are intersecting and you want to find the coordinates of the Intersection point. Solve by Simulataneous Equation.4. If two lines are perpendicular to each other. (Gradient Of Line 1) × (Gradient Of Line 2) = -1,btohqsg
how do i solve by simultaneons,btohqsg
Form two equations lemme take a pic,btohqsg
Form 2 equations. One of them make it into y=... or x=... then the second eqn just write down the eqn they gave u,btohqsg
Quite manageable though can spot topics :),btohqsg
all the best dude!!! did u study for geog alr?,btohqsg
Eh anybody here know how to study for e math paper 2,btohqsg
I for real dk what to study at this point,btohqsg
jus go thru the tys recents ones,btohqsg
dont do just like go thru all like come out w the steps liddat den if uk den ok if udk refer to ans sheet?,btohqsg
Read thru ur past Paper 2 Homework. Rmb the formulas for Cone etc. See thru ur Corrections,btohqsg
Only study the ones that haven’t been tested btw,btohqsg
