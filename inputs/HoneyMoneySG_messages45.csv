Any other bank can cancel via app? I got Cimb and others to cancel also. Play the new to bank game every year,btohqsg
DBS iirc.You have to call to cancel OCBC  Citi and Amex cards definitely.,btohqsg
Amex usually can waive annual fee? I got the low tier plat,btohqsg
No  at best 50% waiver for tcb lately,btohqsg
Hmm.. my plat under utilised. If can’t waive  probably say good bye,btohqsg
Good call. Better to cancel any credit card that we don't use much and don't get much stuff.Even for those cards that we get 10 000 miles every year for paying Annual Fees  we have to ask  is this worth the miles buying?,btohqsg
Thank  you . Which are the card that offer 4 mpd when tagged to amaze ?,btohqsg
Citi Rewards (non travel spend though)  OCBC TR (certain categories),btohqsg
For citi reward if we are using amaze card overseas eg pay for hotel   car rental ? It don qualify ?,btohqsg
may i know what can i spend the $1000 on for hsbc revolution sign up gift? can buy giant vouchers?,btohqsg
whatever u usually spend on  ideally that earns 4mpd,btohqsg
Sorry a silly question   do u use the amaze card locally ? It would earn miles too right,btohqsg
I thought KF credit card with KF saving account can earn up to 6mpd?,btohqsg
Hi all can I get an opinion on something: do y’all get annoyed when your friends/family members use the wrong credit card? Then when you try to correct them  they get annoyed at you lol. I just mean well and want to help them maximise their cashback/miles.,btohqsg
got such thing?Edit: forgotten about it as it was not worth it.,btohqsg
Provided it is in the x10 whitelist and also swipe the card does not earn 4mpd.,btohqsg
Hello all. I’m currently on Royal Caribbean cruise and I had some spending on board. If I use the uob visa signature  does it counted as the 1k min spend ?,btohqsg
Depends on who is the person   but if only friend  try not to kaypoh lah,btohqsg
In my case is parents haha,btohqsg
Experienced similar response last time when I shared with friends why they should not be using their default savings account with miserable interest  why they should make use of open electricity market providers promo etc. Now I don't care already unless people ask me.,btohqsg
ah ok  but miles earned capped at 5% of savings. interest at 0.05% only  so not worth it,btohqsg
Some people just feel that it's not worth their time with all the hassle. They do not understand that all these little savings and earnings do add up to quite significant amount.,btohqsg
I failed to keep track of average daily balance too!,btohqsg
use Excel  it's quite straightforward actually.,btohqsg
Can share me how you do?1. Because the OCBC Average Daily Balance seems like is compare currently month with last month if I understand correctly. 2. How about comparing Jan (31 days) and Feb (28/29 days)??,btohqsg
for previous month daily average balance. check your statement. it's listed there.,btohqsg
so you just need to target to get an amount that's 500 more than the previous month daily average balance. add one dollar more if worried about rounding differences.,btohqsg
then in excel  track day end balance for each day of the month in each row.,btohqsg
2. The formula for average daily balance cater for different number of days in a month,btohqsg
then one column to sum the cumulative daily ending balance,btohqsg
then one column to divide the cumulative daily ending balance with the day of the month,btohqsg
Very common. Not everyone likes to min max.,btohqsg
The issue is they don’t see the rewards so they don’t understand/feel it,btohqsg
last time when I shared about how to get 10% cashback with UOB one and Grabpay + earn grabpoints  people also very skeptical.,btohqsg
Yes haha. that time even paying income tax earn grabpoints.,btohqsg
I planning to Aust  if I link hsbc revol card to amaze card and use for Uber and coles supermarket. Will I get 10x points?,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone with experience of selling their current HDB and buying a resale? Current HDB belongs to my above 65 parents,btohqsg
My personal experience  firstly is the tone it is communicated  no one wants to be the ignorant one so how the info is put across to them is important. Secondly  it is insignificant in a grander scheme of things  5% cashback is $50  unless you spend $1000 and it is one big ticket item  it might not be worthwhile to track the expenses in the different cards. Leave it to those people who are interested to scrimp and save to do it  it's a personal choice.,btohqsg
Anyway  ADB is means that to keep track everyday balance in OCBC360.To hit the save bonus  I make sure I have 500sgd additional as compared to previous month date?,btohqsg
If I use Evol contactless with samsung pay  ntuc grocery counts for 8 percent as well?,btohqsg
6.6% only.The real 8% is Citibank cashback.,btohqsg
effectively 6.67% cos 8% capped for $250 spend for mobile contactless  $250 online  but need $600 min spend.,btohqsg
Ok cos my card usage mainly dining and ntuc grocery. I want to move to UOB One from OCBC 365,btohqsg
Then u should move to Citibank cashback based on your needs,btohqsg
If i can earn 6.6% is good enough cos the main driver is to get 5% on savings account for my 100k,btohqsg
But then petrol need to find another card. Ocbc 365 really fit the bill but average daily balance is kind of annoying,btohqsg
Citi no savings acc that can match upb one 5%. I want something for my salary crediting acc to max out interest on 100k savings,btohqsg
U confusing me. U moving to evol or uob one,btohqsg
U can have the cake and eat it.Go for uob one $500 tier or uob evol $600. With savings account $100k.Then also use Citibank cashback.,btohqsg
yes and not to exceed 500 by too much if you already have 100k inside,btohqsg
for me all giro payments will deduct from UOB one except for taxes deduct from HSBC EGA. so for OCBC 360 there's not much money moments except for salary and interest. so not that difficult to keep track of the daily balances and they can be precomputed.,btohqsg
just need to remember to topup 500 on day 1 to up the daily average balance. then on interest and payday remember to withdraw all on same day if already hit 100k,btohqsg
does anyone knows if GIRO deducts based on credit card monthly bill or remaining balance? Let's say my cc bill is $100 and I have GIRO set up. If I manually pay $10 to the card  will the GIRO deduct $90 or $100?,btohqsg
$90 if u manual pay way in advance,btohqsg
I also wanted to change my giro to EGA however seems like for IRAS it doesn’t support EGIRO  which means I need to manually fill up GIRO form to change from UOB to HSBC?,btohqsg
I believe this is what I didn’t do it correctly  I only missed a day didn’t transfer out my credited salary. So this month I didn’t get my save bonus :(,btohqsg
Hi can i check for UOB one account  i need to spend $500 on my UOB one card first before i can see my “salary credit” indicator fulfilled?,btohqsg
Yes it has to be manul. Mail it to IRAS by filling it up. Not email but post. But to mail it to IRAS no postage is needed. To address needs to be on the front side and return on back side. If you write both address on front it might be sent back to u. Learnt the hard way,btohqsg
I think its not sequence based. During weekends its updated late. If u see the screenshot it say as of 13 may. I.e not updated for today. Ots a little late but as long as criteria is met within the month it just works,btohqsg
Does anyone have a cashback credit card recommendation for public transport and hawker centre usage??,btohqsg
Hahaha i was considering it but i'm thinking about the $500 minimum spend monthly,btohqsg
I typically recommend getting the 2 free supplementary cards so more humans can help to hit the minimum spending.,btohqsg
Hi expert ! I am new to the credit card game and i am considering to register for UOB One account with the EVOL card and i had some questions :-Does paying through paynow is like paying with your credit card if they are linked ? Does it count for the 500$ min spend ?-Does paying through paynow count for mobile contactless/Online/Other spend with card ? Or none of those ?-Just want to confirm the definition of online spend : everything that is paid online meaning in the apps like lazada  grab and on internet liketrip.com  amazon ?-Definition of mobile contactless : with apple pay  Google pay  samsung pay where the card is linked ?-Definition of all other spend : everything else ? Does it include pay now ?Thank you so much !,btohqsg
paynow is paying from savings account  not credit card.Apps or website are both usually online  unless processed offlinemobile contactless is using the card via google/samsung/apple pay and tap the phone,btohqsg
no need be too concern what is other spend cos it is only 0.3%. But if use physical card or at uob$ merchant is under others.,btohqsg
Thank you so much for the clarification ! Are all the card terminal where you can usually pay with paywave can be paid with apple samsung google pay ? Or it needs a specific terminal ?,btohqsg
Nowadays can easily diy buy and sell hdb...https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/selling-a-flat,btohqsg
For ocbc the min spend is by statement month or calendar month?,btohqsg
I thought is calendar month ? No ah ?,btohqsg
Calendar. Make sure the transaction posted (and not Pending) by the end of calendar month tho,btohqsg
posted by end of calendar month,btohqsg
for dbs and another bank I think can egiro. but for HSBC you need to download the form  print  fill up and mail.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if there is a fee to use duitnow in Malaysia? And what are the exchange rates like?,btohqsg
As long as foreign currency charge and hit the 1k min spend u earn 4 miles per dollar. Royal charge in usd i think.,btohqsg
Amaze only can link with master  hsbc wont work,btohqsg
Hi does amaze + crmc gets 10x rewards for simply go mrt?,btohqsg
How about UOB one account min spend ? Is it by calendar month or by statement month ?,btohqsg
May I know is paying ACRA for business renewal fees  consider a transaction for UOB one CC?,btohqsg
Hi all CPF gurus  i want to ask what benefit does topping up VCMA provides to reach BHS yearly on 1 jan. I have watched majority of chris and kelvin's video before arriving at this question.E g. bob has to top up 2.5k cash to reach this year's BHS limit of $68 500 from the previous year's $66 000. Bob is earning $6000 monthly  so 480 into MA monthly.Scenario 1:bob paid $2500 to max out BHS at the start of the year  meaning $480*12 = $5760 is supercharged into his SA.Net gains: $5760 - $2500 = $3260Scenario 2:Bob does not top up at the start of the year but instead allows monthly CPF contributions to max out his BHS.Time taken to max out: $2500 / $480 monthly = 5.2 months. After 5.2 months  subsequent MA amount for the year is supercharged into his SA (12-5.2)*$480= $3264.Net gains: $3264I understand that the $2500 is eligible for tax relief  but at 2.5k tax relief it does not seem significant (<$400 tax payable max at $200k annual income) compared to an expense of $2500 (1 to 4k yearly  depending of increment). Both scenario 1 and 2 provides the same gains in SA overall. The 2.5k could have placed in let's say UOB One or OCBC 360.What are your thoughts?,btohqsg
Hey guys  just to confirm.. Are there sign up promos forexistingdbs credit card users for DBS Altitude Visa and DBS Woman World Mastercard?,btohqsg
Hello!! Im looking for a credit card and never own one before. What are some recommendations for a starter?I have read about the SC smart credit but felt that it was lacking  prefer something I can use day to day  will prefer cash back instead of the rewards system too. I prolly spend less than 1000 per month on transactions.,btohqsg
https://www.sc.com/sg/credit-cards/simply-cash-credit-card/If your spending cannot meet $600 consistent  what about this? Zero admin for changing points to cashback or vouchers. Zero min spend.You can check out the many videos  Chris has produced for the community here.,btohqsg
No la probably not so low haha prolly between 800-1200. But thanks will take a look at that!,btohqsg
Just wanna ask - does crmc give rewards for education? If not  which Mastercard does? If not which Visa card does?,btohqsg
Oh $800-1200. U got couple of good  choices :). Consider your usage case before signing up :),btohqsg
If you intend to have ADB more than $500 compare to previous month  my suggestion is don’t use that account as your main account. Credit $510 on the account every month. Use other bank account for your day to day withdrawal. Then this will save your hassle to keep track ADB.,btohqsg
Need to use Citi Payall. 2.2% admin charge. Use Cardup better ba,btohqsg
But payall got promo now  2.2mpd,btohqsg
if you spend significant amount on food  OCBC 365 pair with the OCBC 360 savings account,btohqsg
easy to clock that in payall,btohqsg
Hi! If my salary is being credited to OCBC360  i transfer a sum out to another account for expenses and keep $500 in the account every month  that means my ADB increases by $500 each month?,btohqsg
I rather use TNG e wallet  registered Duitnow and Topup via Trust credit / debit card with low fx spread and no dcc charges.,btohqsg
Will be traveling overseas in June and main ticket items yet to pay are Car Rental and Hotel Room Charges. What will be the best standalone or combi cards to use to max out earning miles. Currently holding HSBC Revol  DBS Woman's  OCBC Titanium Rewards & Amaze cards. Many thanks in advance 😊,btohqsg
it is by statement month  but u can call uob to change credit card statement to match calendar month,btohqsg
Yeah I usually do that as well. I'm just curious as to what's the difference in fee (if any) and fx rate if I were to use my local paynow directly to pay duitnow in Malaysia,btohqsg
For Ocbc 360  it is an *increase* of ADB $500 compare to previous month. If your ADB last month is $2000  your ADB this month must be at least more than $2500.The whole idea is to have less transactions in and out in your accounts for you to calculate ADB.,btohqsg
What are the choices u recco for this spendage?,btohqsg
In the first year  assuming $200k bracket with 19% tax rate  your $2.5k gives you 23% compared to 5% with UOB one. You might say that your 2.5k is locked up  then it depends on whether you see yourself consistently being able to outperform cpf 4%  or maybe just treat it as fulfilling the low risk portion of your long term retirement plan.But when your income tax bracket gets that high  trust me it hurts.,btohqsg
U should do the $500 on 1st of every month,btohqsg
Oh so it isn't about just increase the balance sum?  Eg. April: $3K  May: $3.5K  Jun: $4K,btohqsg
That would mean fresh fund of $500 on top of the salary credited in?,btohqsg
Do the $500 transfer in on 1st of every month if you intend to transfer ur credited salary out,btohqsg
Yes. This is the easiest way to monitor ADB.,btohqsg
Would it be possible to upon salary crediting  withdraw it out and transfer back $500?,btohqsg
Also  does OCBC allow Fund Transfer - Salary?,btohqsg
Firstly  do you know how to calculate ADB?,btohqsg
Not too sure  would appreciate some explanation! 🙏🏻,btohqsg
ADB=taking your account balance on each day in the month  adding them together  then dividing by the number of days in the month.,btohqsg
I see!! So example:Apr 1: $3KApr 2 - 30: $3.5K(3K + (3.5K x 29 days) / 30ADB = $3483.33Is that so?,btohqsg
Ur usage is it mainly online and mobile contactless? Or can u share usage cases?,btohqsg
I got it now!! Thanks a lot!,btohqsg
Not so sure  cause paynow doesn’t give rewards. So I always use amaze card when I’m in Malaysia.,btohqsg
I guess you could say so! I havent tried mobile contactless for other things except for transport yet. I have seen that the UOB Evol is an option for this.,btohqsg
So if you create a lot of transactions in n out on the account during the month  it will only make your life difficult to calculate ADB. Keep the account transactions as less as possible. Make sure it is at least $500 ADB more compare to previous month.,btohqsg
Understood! With this I'm with OCBC360 now but might look to switch to UOB One as it's lesser hoop to achieve 3.85%,btohqsg
Can I check whether the 90n miles and ocbc$ be chained together as one miles conversion transaction? Purpose : Just pay one conversion fees - $25😁,btohqsg
Mobile contactless means u need to first add the card to your mobile pay wallet (such as Samsung Pay  Apple Pay),btohqsg
Hi expects does anyone know if I can just top up my e-wallet (shoppee pay walletl using the yuu card to get the new sign up bonus?,btohqsg
No  topup to wallet is excluded,btohqsg
The simple way for ocbc 360 is1). to transfer in $500 on 1st of every month.2). When salary and interest are credited into the account  transfer it out by end of the day. So ADB will remain $500 increase.Just this two transactions per month. I believe it is easier to achieve. I personally have not used OCBC 360 before n I plan to open the account in next few weeks.Remember to spend at least $500 on OCBC 90N monthly to meet 4.65% criteria  Or else 4.05%.Other can give comments if it works.,btohqsg
Yes just fellow step 1 and 2  this works. The interest for salary  save and spend category credited separately,btohqsg
This is really helpful! I will try this out  thanks for making it digestible 🙏🏻,btohqsg
So far this is the only way.,btohqsg
Very unfortunate!! But probably gotta speak to HR.UOB's allow for paynow salary,btohqsg
Anyone know if I use AXS to pay for credit card.. using Citibank rewards card as payment can? I know no rewards it’s ok.,btohqsg
Axs does not offer CC as a payment option for CC bills.,btohqsg
How about using HSBC EGA debit card? Got 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Axs accepts debit cards  but axs payments are on the exclusion list  so no rewards.,btohqsg
That's why the grab nerf was a big thing  as it was the most straightforward method to pay CC bills with CC.,btohqsg
I heard from sethisfy   you can earn grab reward using ocbc nxt credit card,btohqsg
One more thing you need to monitor is if your balance in OCBC 360 is more than $100 000  you need to “reset” it at certain period. This is because amount above $100k earns very low interest. Ie 0.5%. Only.,btohqsg
Hi  i can see that grab  shoppee pay  wise etc are on the participating billing organisations list of eGIRO. Anyone has already used eGIRO to pay for those companies ? In what situation ?,btohqsg
Perhaps is those businesses who use shopee or Grab to advertise their product n need to pay them monthly fee ?,btohqsg
How to get interest for spend category?,btohqsg
hi guys  quick question  what is a good cashback card for me to put about 8k on  it should not have a low cashback cap. It is travel-related (hotel  overseas restaurants),btohqsg
for example ocbc 365 caps at $80,btohqsg
My first CC which I’m using currently is HSBC revo  u can consider that,btohqsg
Only a matter of time before they patch the hacks.,btohqsg
Scb Manhattan 🫣But now uob lady solitaire! But u need to split months.,btohqsg
Actually to play the cashback game u need to be dilligence and assign the right type of spend to get the best reward of each card. Which also means u need to juggle multiple cards.No such thing as one card (pun intended) can do everything.,btohqsg
Typically u will have1. A good general spending card2. Good dining card3. Good grocery card,btohqsg
oh I am actually finding a card to put a one lum sum on it  so something that does not have a low cap for cashback,btohqsg
Then there is only one answer. Scb Manhattan.,btohqsg
cimb world mastercard for overseas spend  unlimited 3% rebate 2.5% fx fees,btohqsg

Hi can ask anyone who has experience lately with pacific light electricity +hsbc card promo?,btohqsg
If existing hsbc card holder can I get the 200 rebate by switching provider pls? Not entirely clear on the website,btohqsg
That’s what I missed last month. I didn’t transfer out during salary day  and I missed the save bonus :(,btohqsg
So let’s say last month is 3K ADB. Since there is a need to increase 500 for this month  do it means that with 3488.33 means will not hit the save bonus?,btohqsg
(9 + 2)@Discman  please  send the solution to the arithmetic operation provided within the time amount specified to this group  otherwise you will be kicked. Thank you! (60 sec)Powered by1inch Network,btohqsg
Thanks! That what I wanted to achieve last month  however missed 1 day later to transfer out my salary.,btohqsg
Yes. U need minimum ADB $3500 n above,btohqsg
Those who need capita evoucher  now still have promo  not fully redeem yet according to website. Link your paylah to capitastar member  buy 100 get extra 10 with dbs catd,btohqsg
Wondering if we redeem a saver ticket and choose to change dates (pay $25) can you choose any dates?,btohqsg
thanks. got my $10 bonus. note that can get 1 per member per day weekend)  max of 5 in promo period,btohqsg
Then which card should I use? Dbs live fresh for 5%?,btohqsg
No reward coz ecapita mcc is exclued,btohqsg
It was slow this weekend  last week was fully redeem within hours,btohqsg
Oooo not even 1.2mpd from dbs altitude? Tia,btohqsg
also remember to withdraw out the bonus interest on the same day too.,btohqsg
if need to reset choose a shorter month  ideally Feb. I thinking during the reset month maybe can transfer the full amount to HSBC EGA. but I havent really compute to see worth it or not.,btohqsg
OCBC allows paynow salary too but it needs to be paynow giro and not paynow fast. They will see the transaction code of salary too in order to qualify,btohqsg
Hsbc ega current promotion better or is t bills better?,btohqsg
no one knows what's the next t-bills result... maybe you can put competitive but need to consider the opportunity cost if you didn't get it. try to apply on the last day to minimise the number of days the amount is out of your interest earning savings account.,btohqsg
How do we know if a salary credit meet OCBC 360 criteria? Is there a similar tracker like UOB one shows that the salary requirement is fulfilled?,btohqsg
Nope  only amex capita  uob absolute  amex truecashback earn rebate for ecapita purchase. However this is dbs promo  have to use dbs payment mode,btohqsg
Yes  use the web portal. There’s a tracker that shows the amount of salary that has been credited for the month,btohqsg
You can't connect Hsbc revo to amaze right?,btohqsg
Only master card can connect. Revo is visa.,btohqsg
This one need to ask your hr or payroll. So instead of crediting the salary to you via your bank account  they will credit it to you via paynow using your nric and it will be sent to the bank account which you registered paynow nric with,btohqsg
What would you guys do if bank refused to waive credit card interest charge?,btohqsg
Just to check for ocbc 360 account,btohqsg
If let’s say within a year  if I do not qualify for the $500 savings a month category in that 1 month  they will not give the bonus interest for the $500 savings category for the entire year or just that 1 specific month?,btohqsg
Has anyone seen the good things savings promotion by UOB? Wanted to ask if the earmarked funds for the promotion will still earn the standard interest in the UOB one account,btohqsg
Corrected :Assume your usage use (800 $- 1200$ spending per month on mainly mobile contactless and online)  Ocbc Frank used to give u the best cashback. But after they revised their cashback structure  Evol looks good as u suggest :)OCBCFrank: Cashback is capped at S$25 for Online spendandMobile Contactless spend. Total: $25UobEvol: Cashback is capped at S$20 on Online spend and S$20 on Mobile Contactless spend. Total: $40.,btohqsg
For OCBCFRANK  online and mobile contactless have atotalcap of $25  not each.,btohqsg
singtel app is not consider utilities?,btohqsg
Hi for evol card if i used apple pay on dining is it considered dining or contactless category?,btohqsg
$20 for online and $20 for contactless  dining or other  doesn't matter.,btohqsg
Thanks for correcting me. It was $25 for each of the above categories and 6% rebate. Looks like it had been changed.,btohqsg
Yes  it's been nerfed last November iirc,btohqsg
Yes earmarked fund can still earn interest,btohqsg
Any advise on savings account that does not have any minimum balance requirement.  Thanks.,btohqsg
What is the MCC code for buying CapitaVoucher from Customer Service Counter in CapitaLand Mall? Can clock the $500 min spend for OCBC credit card sign up promotion?,btohqsg
Think they stopped selling physical vouchers donkey time ago already.,btohqsg

It was 6% before the nerf of $25 each for mobile contactless and online categories :),btohqsg
Amaze might have tighten to disallow the use of family members' mastercard ^^,btohqsg

I'mis this cannot link card or no Cashback?,btohqsg
Existing linked card not affected I think. But bad news 😔,btohqsg
I think not affected for now bah,btohqsg
It should work unless you keep linking and delinking.,btohqsg
Oh no  how about eVoucher to gift someone?,btohqsg
It doesn't work right from the first attempt. I'm just informing the community here. If the link to other people mastercard has been working for you  I think just look out for Amaze notice (if any) or potential issues when charging transactions.Personally  I think is a gap to allow pairing of mastercards that is not the same name as the Amaze cardholder.,btohqsg
May I know does HSBC EGA account have any withdrawal limitations? Let’s say I withdraw 2k today and the rest of the amount will still eligible to earn 4.3% right ?,btohqsg
What is the MCC code for eCapitaVoucher online purchase? Can clock the $500 min spend for OCBC credit card sign up promotion?,btohqsg
where u buying? if via capitastar app  mcc 6540 excluded. If via wogi  mcc 5947.,btohqsg
What if my deposit is much higher than withdrawal in a single month ie still net deposit? Is that allowed?,btohqsg
The rules are simply interest earned on incremental deposits when compared to the reference month.,btohqsg
Hi - I had applied for a HSBC credit card. but very suprisinglthey rejected my application.   When i called up the bank they said they cannot tell me the reason for rejection  and I can wait for 6 months and I apply again? Anyone faced this kinf of issue before.?,btohqsg
I have good salary and multiple credit cards for many years. . very surprised.,btohqsg
Luckily I haven’t buy eVoucher via CapitaStar app yet. So the only way is to buy from Wogi to clock $500 min spend?,btohqsg
Most of time they won't tell u reason even u got good credit report or u are able to meet their salary,btohqsg
yeah. I tried a couple of times  but they are not telling me the reason.  I maintain a high balance in the EGA account with them.... still.....,btohqsg
Better don't kept on try if unsuccessful,btohqsg
So apply ega first then sms?,btohqsg
hmm.. i was going to say certain nationalities  HSBC is cautious and won't do business with them due to tax implications.if you are singaporean  then hard to explain... have you cancelled cards with HSBC before? I know some banks will not approve you cards if you are deemed to be frequent cancel and apply.,btohqsg
The only 'discrimination' i faced was during 2008 when Maybank refused to approve credit cards for anyone working in US financial institutions for fear of job instability.,btohqsg
if you use the app  its common to get this rejection because they dont allow second application. Wait for them to call you back.,btohqsg
I never tried myself but think so,btohqsg
https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/available-options.htmlThere might be 'something' they noted from your credit report that give them reasons. FIs typically do not give reasons whatsoever as doing so would reveal their private business rules.Personally  I would just move on. I take it as the FI's loss.,btohqsg
Thanks for all the comments. Appreciate it.,btohqsg
Hello all  does anyone know what card will earn miles for purchasing travel insurance?  Preferably card that earn 4mpd,btohqsg
You may want to search the history in this chat? There were discussion on this previously.,btohqsg
insurance mcc excluded on most cards. Surviving one is maybank visa platinum for quarterly rebate.Not sure what is the MCC if say buy travel insurance from third party like say Klook,btohqsg
Does not using my credit cards hurt my credit score?,btohqsg
No.But cancelling credit cards may hurt your credit score from what I understand.However  you also need to be aware (if income under $120k) that banks may add up all your approved credit limits across all banks when assessing you for a new credit card.,btohqsg
It will not hurt but it certainly will not improve.. credit card gives you credit history which is something institutions use to assess when deciding to give you a loan,btohqsg
Hi all. Difference between AMEX SQ Highflyer vs KrisFlyer Ascend?,btohqsg
hi can check whether your indicator has been updated?,btohqsg
Hi experts  anyone owning citi prestige card and able to get your annual fee waived?,btohqsg
Citibank states it clearly as non waivable.,btohqsg
If u fulfill the eligibility and want a Visa Infinite that the >500 $ annual fees can be waived   please take a look at CIMB Bank. This is the only one that does not need u to waive annual fees because there is no annual fees to begin with.,btohqsg
I have about 90 posb daily $.Is there an optimal way to claim the daily$ ?,btohqsg
Also  would like to ask how does one maximise the benefits of the UOB lady's? Considering to get my significant other to sign up for it.,btohqsg
go google for the review done by a competitor.. don't think i should paste links here,btohqsg
i just started too  and we chose Fashion and Travel categories,btohqsg
have you ever paid your credit card bill before the bill is generated?,btohqsg
Yes :) for exceptional reasons such as cancellation of a credit card.If your concern is the risks of late payment fees  u can make use of the  the 3 biggest bank ibanking portal to schedule payment to your cards. By doing so  u can settle all payments of your cards at one go.,btohqsg
ah.. is your employer crypto related?,btohqsg
Hi  can i check for HSBC EGA promotion  my reference month is March with $0.In May  i deposited 100K. Do i need to deposit additional funds in June and July or just leave the 100K (from May) in the acc for June and July?,btohqsg
It will be sufficient for u to get the promo interest based on 100k. If u deposit more  will get more,btohqsg
Thanks. So I do get interest every month until the EGA promo ends   if I keep the 100K intact,btohqsg
oh actually I'm posting the question to@Siriusblack_82because he said his card application failed. Sometimes paying in advance is not considered a good thing.,btohqsg
you can withdraw partial too it's not locked in. but will get lesser interest.,btohqsg
Anyone tried using cardup or ipaymy for car loan instalment? If so  does it counts as online payment?,btohqsg
No  I mean scheduling payment. I never ever pay my credit cards bill by giro.,btohqsg
for scheduling payment do we need to specify the amount ?or it will be pay according to the bill directly ?,btohqsg
this is troublesome right. you need to determine the amount.,btohqsg
I use giro for credit card bills to clock my UOB one giro bonus interest requirement,btohqsg
hihi  btw for revolut   the 3 x $10 spending  can it be done overseas ?,btohqsg
is it better to use youtrip for online purchase from overseas?,btohqsg
Anyone knows how long it will take  for UOB Credit Card application? :),btohqsg
I think i will just apply for the ocbc dividend+ 4.4% for firat 3 mths...,btohqsg
If successful should be instant. Applied for 3 UOB cards last week and could add cards to Google pay within a day,btohqsg
were you able to add UOB cards to google pay before you received the physical cards?,btohqsg
Yes  but not immediately. Cards showed up on web browser iBanking but on app.Tried next day and showed it up on app. Added to Google pay and successfully used all 3.Maybe only takes a few hrs but I didn't check any more on the first day,btohqsg
U need to specify the amount. You can  remove the fees or dispute transactions in this way. For giro  u can't.,btohqsg
hmm is it a google pay thing?i don't see the option to add a UOB card to Applepay on the TMRW app,btohqsg
Yea Android only  no idea why,btohqsg
Does anyone know which card works with cardup to give miles when paying AIA premiums?Someone said dbs vantage works but I just saw that insurance is excluded for dbs cards,btohqsg
Does that mean that if I paid for my insurance with vantage through card up I will still get 1.5mpd?,btohqsg
Hello just want to see the opinion of you guys. Do you think after settling fixed and variable expenses and setting aside for investment. With the remaining $400-500  should I top up SA or MA? (28y/o btw),btohqsg
My opinion is top up SA because it will count towards the full retirement sum while MA do not. Besides  MA is not withdrawable even you reach 65 and in fact until we die.,btohqsg
Medisave does not count towards FRS?,btohqsg
Wow I just went to re-read OA/SA/Medisave account details. Yes Medisave will not form part of Retirement Account at all!,btohqsg
It's easier to top up the MA to BHS 1st as it's lower. Any additional contributions to MA will flow to SA.. then u can consider to top up ur SA,btohqsg
Are you saying it is better to topup Medisave before Special Account  because once Special Account is full  it will go to Ordinary Account.While if you topup Medisave  it will overflow to Special Account then Ordinary Account?Purpose is to maximise balance in the 4% earning accounts ya?,btohqsg
Yes top up MA to BHS first  supercharge your SA.Plus when you top up SA all these amts are reserved and you cant do shielding,btohqsg
Whether better or not  is up to u... For me  BHS is lower  I'll top up MA 1st... Easier to achieve...,btohqsg
Depends what u want to achieve... Think when MA rch BHS  u won't be able to top up to MA...,btohqsg
end result should be same  whether u max out MA or SA first,btohqsg
yeah i tot so too.. as long as in the end you max Medisave and SA asap.. does it matter which account to be topped up first?,btohqsg
"to me i think is same  although its ""easier"" to max out MA cos amount is lower",btohqsg
I am not familar with the latest CPF rules (I am from the old era where can get $7k tax savings for SA topup and $7k tax savings for Medisave topup).I know it has changed recently  so maybe there is some difference which u choose now?,btohqsg
total is $8k for self now,btohqsg
so technically the tax relief amount is lower? last time can claim max $21k tax relief.... can topup ownself and parents i think...,btohqsg
parents only if their annual income less than $4k,btohqsg
rules keep changing.. better be very familar.. haha...,btohqsg
Any amount that you RSTU into your SA is reserved  and cannot be used for investments. So when the time comes for your RA to be formed  you cannot do CPF shielding to shield this amt in your SA from being drawn into your RA first instead of your OA,btohqsg
WOW they are able to track and remember such things over the years?But anyway  when my time comes at 55 (hope no changes)  I will likely withdraw the maximum in cash. What is the incentive to do CPF shielding these days? When bank interest rates are above 4% p.a.,btohqsg
Just log into your CPF portal to see  mine is like that,btohqsg
Imagine you turned 55 in 2021 you want to withdraw ah? High bank int is the rarity and not the norm as far as I can rmb,btohqsg
shielding is just to take the money to invest in bond basically right,btohqsg
Mine says this but I’m pretty sure I topped up more than $4.7k to my SA in the course of my life??,btohqsg
ya lo  weird  mine also very small dollar amount,btohqsg
Yep@ChrisHMSGhas done aplenty videos on this,btohqsg
Are these historical topups + interest on these topups FROM THE GOVERNMENT (i.e. FREE MONEY).. or are these topups that we used cash to topup for tax savings?,btohqsg
the $7k per year thing for tax relief?,btohqsg
cannot be... i definitely voluntary topped up my SA much more than this amount..unless there is a cutoff year this started?,btohqsg
There’s no guarantee that the bank interest rates will continue so CPF shielding is one way to lock in the interest rate of 4%,btohqsg
got it!i guess it is a blessing in disguise then that my Reserved Amount is $4772 only.. basically this is the amount of my SA that cannot be shielded la..not going to email CPF to ask why only $4772.. whatever.. hahahah,btohqsg
hmmm FRS sum will already be earning 4% p.a. (plus whatever bonuses).I would rather take out the amounts above FRS to do more investments or buy more housings for example. Why leave idle at 4% p.a.,btohqsg
cos at 55 you shouldnt be looking at high risk investment. unless this is extra money you can afford to let it be stuck there in the event of market downturn. 4% riskfree at 55 is pretty good,btohqsg
But at that age  how much risk can you take? If you were to invest into bonds or fixed income  you will need to take on some risk for a bit more yield,btohqsg
rental yield dont think can consistently beat 4% and not all properties get to huat from appreciation also. unless everything works out for you  4% is hard to beat,btohqsg
yes true also... 4% risk free from government (which I understand can be withdrawn ANYTIME after 55) sounds good too also la hor..but who knows what the interest rate environment will be when I am 55...,btohqsg
just hope shielding rules won't change when i'm 54 years old,btohqsg
with the popularity of shielding  i wont be surprised if it does lol,btohqsg
It is all relative I guess.If UOB One and HSBC EGA continues to keep paying 5% p.a. interest... then SA (after 55 years old) at 4% p.a. won't look attractive.,btohqsg
yep  but its unlikely AND also need to consider the fluctuation of rates. 5% for 10 years later drop to 1% after that  you will be better off not moving the money at all. very subjective movement and very one way,btohqsg
Can't believe we so fast forget the days like these:https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/banking-finance/uob-further-cuts-interest-rates-flagship-account,btohqsg
i think it is starting point..i am very old... i am used to interest rates being 3-4% p.a.,btohqsg
that being said  it is unlikely for US to have their baseline interest rates close to 0 ever again  in our lifetime i feel.,btohqsg
Top up MA  it’s easier to achieve and once u hit BHS  it will help your SA grow faster without having additional reserved amount lock up.,btohqsg
No its housing grant aka free money but for purposes of paying for housing only,btohqsg
maybe credited into OA for grant uses?,btohqsg
Yes the grant is credited into your OA,btohqsg
Oh so next time if u sell house  dont need to pay back the grant?,btohqsg
Idk actl any other gurus here can answer? My house doesnt even exist yet I havent even gotten to thinking about selling lmao,btohqsg
what kind of house did you get? normal 5 year MOP BTO? or 10 year PLH BTO?anyway both will not need you to repay housing grants  as long as you satisfy the MOP.,btohqsg
If have 500k cash will u pay off mortgage or put in high interest bank accounts?,btohqsg
well it depends on what is your mortgage rate... if you locked in a good rate for a few years.. then don't repay first,btohqsg
Whichever helps you sleep better at night,btohqsg
what i can suggest is you go shop around now.. see what is the fixed rate for 1 or 2 years housing loan u can get... then if lower than 4%  you can still play the savings account game for that same period,btohqsg
if you can lock in 3.7% for 2 years... then your $500k cash put in savings account is better isn't it?,btohqsg
Yeah looking ard now  bachelor thinking of selling n move to another location in sg,btohqsg
Icic..need to find smth with better yield like hsbc or ocbc div,btohqsg
Will u consider buy one more property with the 500k?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA seems to be going strong still. but you need to control 2 accounts to play musical chairs and you can enjoy 5%+ p.a. savings account interest,btohqsg
Went down raffles place branch at 930am but q seems long and gg to take 1+hr to open account. Maybe go down again tmr to try,btohqsg
im thinking if more people signing up for HSBC EGA is a good thing (they will maintain high rates longer) or a bad thing (they will lower rates soon).,btohqsg
Can  but mine got bug  keeps rejecting my application online coz maybe i had hsbc cards before,btohqsg
Looking at ocbc div+ also 4.4% first firdt 3 mths,btohqsg
you need to put back to your cpf. the money is still yours(if you are the gang that feels cpf is your money),btohqsg
alot of people that i know thought that need to return grant to government so they dont bother applying for it  but please do. you only need to return it to your cpfoa with accrued interest which is still your money,btohqsg
So the grant is from hdb?,btohqsg
I use the hsbc calculator online and it only have high interest if 100k and few other spending,btohqsg
yes at the point of choosing flat the officer should ask you whether you want to apply for any grant. during my time is combined income above 5k then dont qualify anymore. i think now they increase it so can get more grants. new ruling is need to submit past 12 months payslip for their review,btohqsg

Usually for fresh grad will need to wait ~3months so that banks can pull data for your cpf contribution.For cashback cards can start with those that have no min spending but they usually have lower cashback rates like SC Simply Cash  HSBC Advance  UOB absoluteFor miles usually got no min spending so try to go for those with higher rewards like HSBC Revo  Citi Rewards  DBS WWMC  UOB Lady (for ladies only),btohqsg

Hi Expects  does HSBC Revolution Card qualify ASA  Chan Brother  CTC  WTS Travel as Travel transaction?,btohqsg
If I were you  I need to decide between a miles or cashback card first. My key considerations are: 1)No pressure to spend  2) the miles can keep long long or higher cashback rate. 3) Can pair with Amaze for foreign currency spending.Miles: I would choose Citi Premiermiles Mastercard or OCBC 90n MastercardCashback : Citi Rewards Mastercard or SCB Simply Cash Mastercard++ Instarem Amaze to pair with any of the cards above for foreign currency spend.,btohqsg
Morning all! I’m heading for Cruise at Royal Carribean soon! I understand that the spending onboard is USD-denominated! Can I check which Cashback or Miles credit card is the  best for this trip?? 😊Do seek all the help from the experts here!,btohqsg
Wow! Enjoy your cruise. Assume u want to focus your energy on other matters and not be bothered about card applications. May be u share the  cards u have broadly ?,btohqsg
Hmmm sure!I have the following:- HSBC Revo- Citi Cashback+- Citi Rewards- UOB Absolute CB- UOB EVOL- SC Smart- Amaze (For CRMC),btohqsg
Would let the folks advise. As I never go cruise before  I dun know the MCC code of the merchants onboard. If all MCC code are travel related  then no Cashback le.,btohqsg
Yups ideally would want to use CRMC + Amaze but not sure about the MCC (if it’s under Travel)Seeking guidance from anyone (: please chime in to help me out!,btohqsg
should be mcc 4411  excluded travel spend,btohqsg
Thanks for the info  really helps a lot. Just to check for those stated online for some of the merchant eg. ASA. Do I use Kris+ app to pay to qualify as online transaction?,btohqsg
Need someone who have been onboard to advise. I never buy anything inflight before.Btw  do u happen to have Trust Bank Visa?,btohqsg
roughly how much u spending  there are quite good overseaa spend promos ongoing but some need min sum,btohqsg
Oh yes I do have the debit card too!,btohqsg
Hmm I don’t think we are going to spend a lot  just some ad-hoc spends on activities that we are interested in :)),btohqsg
No. Visit their branches/outlets to scan. Call them to check first before visiting their branches.Also can check with them if Kris+ cash voucher can help you save additional $$.,btohqsg
Nice! If u don't want to have the pressure to spend  u don't know what MCC the merchants onboard would use  etc etc  u can convert your Debit card to credit card by completing the  Singpass MyInfo verification of income. Approval is near real time.If I were u  I would use this approach and switch my Trust Bank card pairing to my Trust Bank credit card account and use the Trust Bank card on board or at the end of the trip to settle bills.,btohqsg
think can go for the Amaze 4x instapoints promo if spend from Amaze wallet by 31 May  no fx fee. 4x instapoints equivalent to 4% rebate but need 2000 instapoints to redeem cashback. Topup Amaze wallet before the spend. Usually no rewards for the topup itself.https://www.instarem.com/blog/terms-and-conditions/instarem-amaze-wallet-may-4x-instapoints-wallet-2023-promo/,btohqsg

What is yourparking.sgspend per month? If below $50  don't really matters in the grand scheme of things.,btohqsg
I dont use it often. But can it be paired with uob amex or boc sheng siong card?,btohqsg
Anything u like man. For me  theparking.sgapp is installed on my wife phone. She charge it to her dbs woman card just to meet the Multiplier's credit card usage criterion.,btohqsg
I see. Let me try the amex first. If it doesnt work  then i got to check the respective master/visa card's exclusion,btohqsg
I won't bother to check if my usage is not often. I would conserve my energy for other matters.,btohqsg
Thanks all for the inputs! It seems that the top options for onboard cruise spending are1. Trust Bank Credit Card2. Amaze Wallet (With the current promotion of 4% Cashback)Do seek other peeps' opinion if there are still better cards potentially out there 😄,btohqsg
does citi premier miles card charges annual fee?,btohqsg
Yes of cos :) to keep office air con and lights on and staff paid. However  u can submit for fees waiver subject to bank approval. I told the card for close to 8 years and manage to waive fees.,btohqsg
R u using M1 Corporate Individual scheme? Or u r the 老板 paying for your company bill?,btohqsg
I not 老板. Try my best to answer 😊But the MCC code is under telco. If u paid manually  is an online transaction. If u pay as recurring bill  I am not sure whether is considered as online transaction. Folks here might be able to advise better.,btohqsg

Hi does citi premiermiles still earn 1.2mpd If I were to tag with Amaze and purchase air tickets?,btohqsg
Hello can i check for uob one account to earn 5% is to salary giro + spend $500 only right? The 3 giro is not necessary ya,btohqsg
any recommended cards for purchasing air tickets with foreign currency charges ? miles card,btohqsg
"Try looking up ""2023 Edition: Best cards for overseas spending"" by milelion  very extensive article (looks like the HSBC Revo is the way to go)",btohqsg
yeah but HSBC Revo will be charging with bank FX rates  since the total amount is in foreign currency,btohqsg
Well.. if that's the concern why not charge it to Amaze instead ? (Not too sure which portal u buying from so... See situation I suppose ),btohqsg
btw in case it's SIA  you will be offered the option to pay with SGD if u paying by credit card  personal experience like...two days back (was under imrepssion i had to pay only in FCY),btohqsg
But if I were you  I will do payments with Amaze + a travel 4mpd or a 1.2mpd card  since  i will assume the travel ticket expense will generate quite an amount of instapoints to get the 1% cashback before it expires (2000 SGD equivalent —> 20 dollars cashback),btohqsg
yeah  not sure what other cards can earn same rewards as Citi Rewards  since it doesn't cover travel expenses  and also don't have a UOB lady's card.Purchasing from Ryanair website.,btohqsg
sadly its not  purchasing from Ryanair will be charge with EUR,btohqsg
Any idea if Citi Premiermiles will work with Amaze and the miles earn include travel?,btohqsg
-sigh- it's just sad UOB has to make UOB Lady's Card Female-Exclusive..Bank FCY wise sadly not much control.So it does sound like HSBC Revo against CitiPM + Amaze (yes i received miles for travel related transactions  but mainly Agoda),btohqsg
yeah 🫠 I suppose CitiPM might be the next best option for now,btohqsg
Can take a look at UOB VS (see it being mentioned quite often in ML)  but not something im familiar with since I don't use the card,btohqsg
how many of your think that it is important to achieve FRS before you can quit your job and FIRE?,btohqsg
Y? The payout is a pittance,btohqsg
Only comes into your budget after you put everything into cpf life and from 65 onwards to maximise monthly pension amount…,btohqsg
I think achieving FRS is a step in the right direction. In the grand scheme of FIRE  I'm sure there are much to be done before we can quit our day job (assume our day job is not what we enjoy) and do what we really enjoy.On this note  I think it is equally important to note that there are many who cannot meet the FRS when they turn 55 because of various reasons. So FRS is never ever going to be part of a silver bullet.,btohqsg
May be i suggest u play with the cpf life calculators online to see how much is the payout first?,btohqsg
because it might took me quite awhile to even max out my bhs and even to supercharge my frsbut i think it will act as a safety net when i reach 65 for the payout,btohqsg
but should one reduce their monthly investment just to fund more on cpf,btohqsg
base on what you say im guessing you are still young and also willing to take risk  so i would say no. keep investing,btohqsg
just thinking if i should to achieve BHS to supercharge my FRS,btohqsg
dont have to worry much about supercharge. i am 34 and ma only at low 40k  but i have done my calculations that my cpf balances will be very healthy in 50s and 60s cos magic of compounding,btohqsg
dont forget when you ultimately hit frs  your ma contribution will flow to oa and not sa anymore,btohqsg
Bought a house? Ot self employed,btohqsg
yes so eventually the supercharging will plateau. if you are the conservative type then topping up cpf will be a good baseline  but if can stomach more risk then go ahead with investmentd after doing your due diligence,btohqsg
this 40k is ma not oa. employee but pay only caught up in recent years,btohqsg

She doesn't sign the signature exactly the same anymore.. If she used the 10 years ago signature  then all her current cheques will bounce right? I don't understand them.. Just update signature can liao what.,btohqsg

Anyone sign up for the bonus interest promotion by HSBC,btohqsg
Do anyone know if the bonus interest on everyday account means u need top up monthly to get bonus interest ?,btohqsg
there will be a reference month,btohqsg
depends what platform u use and what settings u do...  i think got some examples above.. just follow them EXACTLY,btohqsg
did chris publish a video? i not sure.. haha,btohqsg
The reference month keep on moving one rightMay2023  reference month is April 2023June2023 reference month is May 2023July 2023 reference month is June 2023Is it right?,btohqsg
reference month for 4.x% does not move when u sms inreference month for 1% is always the previous month,btohqsg
Do i need to top up during the promotion monthsAs it state this promotion will be paid bonus interest on the top up amount for the calendar monyhs May 2023 June 2023  July 2023  august 2023,btohqsg
no need topup if after the 4.x% only1% you need 2 accounts to rotate,btohqsg
And you only know whether you did it right 6 months later 😅,btohqsg
very long later la... haha... just use excel to keep track,btohqsg
1 percent how to do it,btohqsg
rotate between 2 accounts... search earlier msgs.. mentioned b4,btohqsg
What is 5 transfer out ? Stated?,btohqsg
transfer to your other account $10 five times.,btohqsg
Then what is put in all in march and may ?,btohqsg
I think this is where you review Chris ‘s YouTubes and read the T snd Cs to avoid misinterpreting things 👍🏻,btohqsg
yes i agree... it is best to watch the official video and read the official TNC..The worst that can happen is you read piece meal msgs and end up do wrongly.. lose the benefits and rage..,btohqsg
Chris video is very good but the content is based on point in time info. Fully agree  it is our responsibility to read the TnC to confirm 😊,btohqsg

Hi bosses.1) Any particular card strategy good for short burst of increase in spending (i.e. Reno + buy furnitures/appliances)2) any card that offer interest free and without processing/admin fee to split my huge spending to monthly installment?,btohqsg
From my tests so far  you have to apply for the NEXT tbill after the maturing tbill.The credit of the maturing Tbill will not make it in time for the deduction of the new Tbill that is Issued on the same day as your Maturity.So basically if your Tbill matures today 16th May 2023  you can only use the maturity proceeds to apply for the End May 2023 one.For this case  for good practice (actually I think it won't make a difference)  you should manually transfer the maturity proceeds from your CPF IA back to CPF OA once you see the maturity proceeds in your CPF IA (just in case you don't get full allocation).,btohqsg
Those mile chasers here  if you are using UOB One account to maximise interest and cashback  what kind of spend categories do you park under UOB One/Evol to meet the minimum spend criteria,btohqsg
My post is just an example for those with March-June cycle   you need to find out your own cycle and replace accordingly,btohqsg
Hi all may i check with the experts here  the most recent T-bill is issued on 16th May (today) right? How come i still dont see it in my cdp account?,btohqsg
Want to understand put in all means what?Why need to do 2 times,btohqsg
All means all you have  if u have another high saving account  you can do merry go round trick with EGA+1 high saving accounts because of the additional 1% for everyday reward promo,btohqsg
What I would add as comment is it is very difficult for anyone to completely give you the full steps to perform the tasks. It is only advice on a best effort basis.Strongly recommend you read the TNC document 5 times so you are familiar  to avoid disappointment after 6 months.,btohqsg
This is not being sarcastic or unhelpful to be honest. This is what I believe most of us HSBC EGA players had to do ourselves in order to fully understand how it works (for our individual situation).,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is one of the most complicated savings accounts out there now (as with UOB One credit card being one of the most complicated credit cards out there).But both are among the most rewarding savings and credit cards out there.,btohqsg
I called hsbc twice to enquire. Both gave me two different answer,btohqsg

U will be surprised.. it is rather complicated until HSBC staff themselves are not trained properly.,btohqsg
at first yes chim  but u read the TnC everyday for 1 month you will also be pro like the korkors above too,btohqsg
I've decided to go to bank open acct + ask on the spot. Bcoz I think the person whom I spoke to  made me even more confusing...,btohqsg
I give up hsbc...gg to open ocbc div+  instead,btohqsg
Can I use instarem amaze pair with HSBC revolutions for booking airtickets in foreign currency? My total spend would be around 3 to 4 k in sgd. Is that the best combo if I have EGA. I don't have the UOB women's card,btohqsg
cannot. instarem amaze can only pair mastercards,btohqsg
I have Citi rewards Citi premier miles and UOB one credit card. And yuu and dbs altitude,btohqsg

So sir what would be the best option,btohqsg
Yes but don't and can't have UOB women's,btohqsg
Btw I’m sure someone in your family should be able to get uob lady card correct? Suggest u explore that.,btohqsg
Wife not working is it ok?,btohqsg
Can earn money by buying n selling car,btohqsg
If not then should I just do HSBC revolutions,btohqsg
Ok but will take time I'm so sorry for being so terrible,btohqsg
These are the 2 best cards I can think of for larger travel expenses.Let’s see if others have recommendations too.,btohqsg
U definitely should use amaze to save on the fx fees.,btohqsg
Uob lady and scb Manhattan? Thank you so much for your kind help,btohqsg
Ok then I will just use amaze with Citi premier miles,btohqsg
That’s only 1.2 miles per dollar right? Don’t think it’s good but I’ll let miles pro comment (I just started out using miles cards).,btohqsg
Yes. Unfortunately I don't have many good cards and time at hand. I have HSBC EGA with advance and revolutions. Then I have Citi rewards and premier miles. Uob one. Dbs yuu live fresh and altitude. Scb infinite and smart,btohqsg

Hi i’m a student here who wants to know how can i better work-school-life balance.who’s only available  wed thurs  sat and sun. I want to earn cash and have flexible timing. Like min 12 per hour  anything higher is a an added bonus. However i’m afraid i cannot cope with the workload of work and sch. Is there an alrernative for me to make money.

Be careful don’t fall for Money mule or job scams,btohqsg
open carousell account sell unused stuffs ?,btohqsg
Did that too but carousell waiting time is long. I dont thing investing in carousell coins to make it “sellable” is ideal what do u think ?,btohqsg
you male or female? female got more options.,btohqsg
just put that and do on free time  no need to buy coins  if not can do part time delivery like grab or foodpanda ?,btohqsg
Google part time jobs / job part time jobs channel on telegram,btohqsg

Alright. Best if i did my research,btohqsg
I preorder some games online and sell them immediately at normal price in carousell when it releases.Can give you 10% profit 😊... Not bad for extra pocket money,btohqsg
Need to stalk online platforms like lazada  shopee etc and pre-ordered the games. Use vouchers and cc for discounts.And sell it in carousell at normal price when it is delivered to you..,btohqsg
I did that too but then i just want to earn enough to fund for my notebook course and also my daily expenses like transport and food. I basically want to be independent from my parents. I did work in the past before  just like i feel like now is the best time for me to get my own savings sorted out. I’m not very good at numbers but yeah  if anyone is in the same situation as me feel free :),btohqsg
Hi guys  does anyone know if TCM can earn miles? If so  which card is best for it?,btohqsg
Why do u want to be independent from your parents while still on studying phase? Isn’t it more advisable to still continue to be financially reliant on your parents until you graduate? So u have more time to focus on your studies to achieve the best results u can?,btohqsg
Great question. In my current sem i have free time and possibly 10hrs of working time to spare  within that time frame i’m comfortably fine with getting a part time to “feed” myself. I still do get allowance from my parents however I appreciate them in their responsibility and thus be able to earn a “living” for myself. I’m turning 18 this year and in year 1 poly so,btohqsg
Wow u are a very “good child”.Sadly I don’t have any easy / safe way for u to earn > $12 per hour consistently based on your circumstances.,btohqsg
is there a reason why ocbc 365 credit card isn't much talked about? it seems quite competitive woth 6% on certain spend and also no category limits for overall cashback unlike other cards. how is it compared to other similar cards?,btohqsg
Max cashback $80 per month. Minimum $800 spend per month. More focus on dinning and fuel. You may want to compare this against Maybank FnF.,btohqsg
While 365 has good cashback on dining and petrol + it can get cashback on utilities and travel - some people don’t own a car and also most of my friends don’t pay bills for their household at all nor contribute for family groceries. Also it does not cover general retail stores and shoppee all those. And 800$ spend quite high.I personally use 365 cos I pay for family groceries + utilities which easily hit 500$+ a month alrd and 300$ for food a month is reasonable for fresh working adult. I also complement it with HSBC revo for retail spend and SC Smart for simplygo. Also helps for bonus interest from 360 account.But for others  no point using it when UOB Evol has almost similar cashback (5% I think isit?) or Miles chaser prefer CRMC or WWMC. If you want higher interest also UOB one better but I got hugely turned off by their CS from the early UOB absolute days that I refuse to deal with them any furtherTldr: only useful if spending for dining  petrol  utilities can hit 800$,btohqsg
Wah  $12/hour is quite a tall order for part time jobs. In current market you'd be lucky to even earn $10.50/hour,btohqsg
It’s not of a “ very good child “ type of appreciation i want to have but good discipline and ethics and virtues goes a long way. In terms of my financial journey,btohqsg

think can go for the Amaze 4x instapoints promo if spend from Amaze wallet by 31 May  no fx fee. 4x instapoints equivalent to 4% rebate but need 2000 instapoints block to redeem cashback. I assuming you not paying more than $3k at one go cos Amaze wallet can hold $3k max. Topup Amaze wallet before the spend. Usually no rewards for the topup itself.https://www.instarem.com/blog/terms-and-conditions/instarem-amaze-wallet-may-4x-instapoints-wallet-2023-promo/,btohqsg

call their hotline to transfer credit balance to your account,btohqsg

Quick check. Is recurring bill payment to M1  Starhub  SP services and Senoko considered as an online transaction? Thanks folks:),btohqsg

Latest Tbill (16th May 2023) should be reflected both in CDP (cash) and Bank Internet Banking (CPF) as of now.,btohqsg
good to use if the bulk of ur balance is in 360 account and if ur salary credit is to this account also,btohqsg
Agree. But if you have credit card spend of 500$ each month  UOB one’s 4.05 % (I think) beats OCBC’s rate :) UOB’s credit cards are markedly better too for the merchants available for cashbackI prefer OCBC anyway personally for the better CS than UOB lol,btohqsg

I heard this before but you must really know the used cars market.Typically it works only for the rarer and more unique cars where there is Price Asymmetry. The seller doesn't know the true value of the car (and sells cheaper than true value to you) and the buyer doesn't know the true value of the car (and buys more expensive than true value from you).,btohqsg
nope it should never be the case. its your money and you are asking them to transfer excess back to you,btohqsg

Amaze charges about 1.5 - 2%  but they give you 1% additional cashback. So you are basically paying 0.5% - 1% for 1.2 miles  which is still great in my opinion,btohqsg
if spending in May  can take advantage of the 4x instapoint promo for spending from Amaze wallet. Equivalent to 4% cashback without fx fee  less markup also. Topup to Amaze wallet before linking it to Amaze card for the spend. Topup Amaze no cc rebate.,btohqsg

Fyi cpf ia account pays 0.05% pa interest on cash balances. U move money back to cpf oa account now u also won’t earn interest for May 2023.

good idea. can take a photo first and scan later without going back shop. maybe just need to pay 1 cent? but I suspect if you pay 10 cant you get back max 10 cent. hope to hear from anyone that has tried.,btohqsg

Hi. Btw  where do I set this up?  In the HSBC app or on some eGiro mixrosite?,btohqsg
Possible to tell the merchant you will pay in two transactions. Example item is $5.00  you pay $4.90 first  then pay $0.10?Or if the cash back is 10%  then pay $4.50 first to get the cashback $0.45. Then pay $0.50 on 2nd transaction to redeem the 0.45.Let me know if it works.,btohqsg
Ditto to the taking of pic first. Just did this at a coffeeshop to claim cashback  works instantly,btohqsg

What's changing?Top-up feesCard top-ups to Revolut will now be charged. These fees will vary  depending on your card type:SG-issued cards (non-commercial)• 0.51% for Mastercard debit card• 0.62% for Mastercard credit card• 0.30% for Visa debit card• 1.97% for Visa credit card (unchanged)Other cards•  2.08% for international cards•  1.12% for commercial cardsYour first top-up via card remains free. To avoid paying fees  consider adding money via bank transfer — another fast and seamless top-up option. Check out this blog to find out more about bank transfers via our app.,btohqsg
Not promo. Just a hack to get back the Cashback.U can refer to this video for details:https://youtu.be/lt5Yr4PoTZs,btohqsg
I'm not sure but i would rather not ba. most merchants are not very well versed with this kind of payment mode it might create more confusion for them. Although you might be able to get away by pretending you accidentally key in wrong number but need to be believable lor.also the second part...paying 50c for a 45c cashback i still lose out on 5c  and there is still a 5c cashback pending to get back. I think the best case is to pay the 10c second time and get the cashback back.,btohqsg
Topup fees to be introduced for card topups on Revolut from June,btohqsg
Pretty fast. Within a week I think.,btohqsg

Even with metal plan they don't care one 😂,btohqsg
not all need  will depend on which card so might need to check on the card itself. i think there are 4 possibilities:1. auto transferred to kf every month2. pay this 27 each time you need3. pay 42(or so) yearly  is a season pass can convert throughout the year4. free transfers to kf,btohqsg
Just check only Amax is outo transferred orther need to convert and some got Expriy date if don't convert,btohqsg

Supermarket (NTUC) got KrisPay 😂But that one miles only  good for using non-transferrable KrisPay miles to convert to vouchers during milesback promo,btohqsg
On a side note  never knew Frasers mall got this type of limitation 😱,btohqsg
Kris+ for atas merchants  XNAP for economy merchants. The usage is similar  depends on your lifestyle. I use XNAP far more often than Kris+,btohqsg
fairprice finest to be more specific,btohqsg
E.g. Kris+ vs XNAPWooloomooloo steakhouse vs Western Hawker store Mixed GrillParis Baguette vs Kopi toast setPolar Puff and cake vs Neighborhood bakery,btohqsg

Hi. For the UOB One Savings Account  does the bank mail us the ATM card (for withdrawal/deposit purposes) or is this something we need to request separately?,btohqsg
Can't remember  but I think it's applied with the account together (btw be warned the UOB one DEBIT card has an annual fee. Why? I also dont know),btohqsg
This is really something new for me  lucky u guys spoke abt itIf not I won’t figured that there’s a annual fee for the debit card which I don’t use,btohqsg
Coindentally i will be releasing a debit card video 2 days later  talking about this,btohqsg

you didn't specify which UOB card. Some UOB cards are white list some are black list  so you probably should double check against the specific TNC.But to answer your question directly booking.comis not on any UOB TNC exclusion that I am aware of.,btohqsg
