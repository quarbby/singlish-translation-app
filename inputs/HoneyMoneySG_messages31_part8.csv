Hi wats the best payment form to use in Thailand?,btohqsg
how to ensure all payment is listed as online purchase?,btohqsg
how will the yearly deduction of medishield life/careshield life affect this? means have to top up yearly to account for this deduction? is the BHS like an imaginary cap number? like once u hit it means its capped even after you use it for hospitalisation etc (eg my mom's RA is capped because it was maxed out before so even after she draws out money i cant claim relief even after contributing 7k) ?,btohqsg
Hi guys any recommendations for savings account at the moment? NSF here.,btohqsg
1) Yes you have to top it back up. Your interest calculation for any month of deduction will affect as CPF takes the lowest amount of every month and totals it up at the end of the year and gives you the interest on 1 Jan.2) If you have already reached BHS  then this deduction can be seen as a good thing as it allows you to squeeze in some tax relief.3) BHS limit increases annually. E.g. last year 66k  this year 68.5kI am unsure if you are able to pay these deductions via cash. Maybe someone can advise here...Hope I didn't miss out any points for you to consider...,btohqsg
