üíéPika World Update 4 March 2022üíéüß®What just happened?ü•äEquity markets broadly sold off in the final 2 hours of the trading session on Thursday  given the uncertainty of how the economy will turn out. In addition  a statement by a Fed official unnerves investors again.All 3 significant indexes were green in the early session. The selloff reflects a new trend that investors are willing to sell off on any profitable day. WTI crude oil trended down after hitting $116 in an intraday high  the highest since Sept 2008.‚åõÔ∏èS&P 500 needs more oilüõªThe index 20-day moving average is around 4420  and it had a problematic experience in holding above this level in recent weeks. Moreover  the uncertainty on the Fed's monetary policy change also adds concern to the investors' minds. As a result  Uncle Powell's inclination to a 0.25% hike which was a comfort seemed to fade.Indices dived sharply  giving up gain after Cleveland Fed President spooked market participants when she mentioned that the Fed would have to raise rates quickly to fight inflation if it does not come down soon. A further addition is her belief that the Fed-Fund rate will have to shoot above the neutral rate  harmful to stocks.üìÆWhat's next?üî¶Today  we will receive a piece of important news. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the employment figure for February. We are looking at 440 000 additional jobs  slightly below Jan's 467 000. Investors want to see a strong job figure but not that firm enough to push the Fed to raise rates faster. It is a delicate balance we are aiming for.It is 4 March  Friday  at 7.10  am in Singapore and 7.10 pm in New York.Pika World wishes everyone a profitable trading week on a volatile trading day!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg
