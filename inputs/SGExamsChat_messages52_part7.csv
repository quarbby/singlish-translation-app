just run daily will improve one,btohqsg
now i nth to do i everyday go for run,btohqsg
covid19 just made me recently realise how inept world leaders and govt orgs can be and how they could lack more common sense than an avg person,btohqsg
spain opening up their borders  barely recovered,btohqsg
singapore only implemented cb when shit really went down,btohqsg
They know exactly what they're doing.,btohqsg
The number of infected is just a number,btohqsg
as if US gdp is gonna have an upward trend with the things they doing at this rate,btohqsg
Haha if you downplay the virus and encourage ppl to move about,btohqsg
And have a voter base that eats your words like it's some candy,btohqsg
actually  their money minded mindset is exactly why we shouldnt trust them,btohqsg
Anyway it's impossible for some countries to impose social gathering,btohqsg
imagine being so damn superficial and egoistic,btohqsg
But we kinda don't really have a choice,btohqsg
yeah lets see what happens months down the road,btohqsg
Wishing I could get fries at this hour,btohqsg
dats why must always hav food prepped at home,btohqsg
I won't be able to fry French fries at 1am in the morning,btohqsg
Without my grandma coming out to scold me  that is ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
i once baked cookies at 5am,btohqsg
ok tbf i was pulling an all nighter,btohqsg
next day was project submissions and valentines day,btohqsg
This doesn't feel very healthy xd,btohqsg
Are you trying some weight loss thingy?,btohqsg
who has started grinding for O level ?,btohqsg
Unfortunately next week my Mother work at home use my PC,btohqsg
6 pts HAHAHA good one . personally   I feel that 6 points would be struggle with the bloody situation,btohqsg
i'm grinding 25 hrs per day to compensate and to get 6 points,btohqsg
Tbh 6 points is only useful for JC/Poly application beyond that useless liao,btohqsg
Yes then RI will increase COP,btohqsg
ya but if you get into sch's with lower COP  you probs have a higher chance of doing well for As due to peer pressure and possibly better teaching departments,btohqsg
Depends u know coz some people legit canâ€™t take the stress from the competition,btohqsg
But tbh once u get into JC,btohqsg
No matter how high or Low ur COP is,btohqsg
A levels is different ball game,btohqsg
Basically once u get into JC dun keep looking back at ur Os and say couldâ€™ve done better,btohqsg
U can make ur Os results not affect ur As results by working hard for JC,btohqsg
ya so impt to get into the sch with peeps who are around your level. just enough to make you feel the pressure  but not too much,btohqsg
can la  but the environment plays a huge role imo,btohqsg
Or if u go to higher cop school youâ€™ll feel motivated and better about yourself,btohqsg
Depends on the kind of person u r I guess,btohqsg
Just a little bit  or full water parade?,btohqsg
then you could possibly become complacent cos you're doing relatively well compared to sch  but that may be strictly so compared to the national avg,btohqsg
drink to the point of thirst,btohqsg
The lower COP school thing sometimes not tru,btohqsg
ACJC lower COP but A level results lower RP than TJC,btohqsg
Even if u exclude the IP for TJC,btohqsg
Itâ€™s 79.8 RP vs 82 RP,btohqsg
but i think the it holds true for most JCs,btohqsg
Or ACJC is the one thatâ€™s special,btohqsg
