imperfect info is one of the criteria for merit/demerit,btohqsg
Lmao my sch always guilt trips on the MSC distance to fulfil that,btohqsg
for merit/demerit we use MPB perceived/actual,btohqsg
Ya lorSo the actual deviates by a distance of MSC,btohqsg
"Only thing need to study is fkin ""economic analysis""",btohqsg
had to mug my ass off for econs,btohqsg
If h2 yes  if h1 no,btohqsg
No la abt the same as h2 for some years,btohqsg
My sch h1 dist way higher than h2 so its ok,btohqsg
The only thing that required some skill was concept of circular flow of income,btohqsg
i still rmb the mrt broke down on my way to sch during my econs a lvl,btohqsg
"Then ppl from other schools are like""YOU DONT HAVE TO DRAW OUT THE CIRCULAR FLOW DIAGRAM""",btohqsg
"And i was like""Sure  bro  have fun losing 4 marks""",btohqsg
Lemme find that thread if i can  it was quite funny,btohqsg
tbh i find econs quite ok,btohqsg
That‚Äôs cause it doesn‚Äôt have any maths yet,btohqsg
but thats probably cuz im taking h1 and my econs cher was quite godly,btohqsg
I got a U for H2 econs and my teacher was like,btohqsg
"""If you can't cope pls do drop it to H1""",btohqsg
actl isnt h2 and h1 econs quite similar,btohqsg
"""later cannot do well for A levels""",btohqsg
q huge if you ask me,btohqsg
no market structure no international economy,btohqsg
idk my sch econs department say there is only a small gap in content knowledge so they prompted everyone to take 4 h2,btohqsg
maybe you're from a top jc,btohqsg
Mr rlauncher was in denial that it was a H1 conceptIt was only taken out from h1 syllabus after 2017,btohqsg
in my school i just took 4H2s because my entire cohort did hahaha,btohqsg
The resources more or less the same,btohqsg
p solid if you ask me,btohqsg
Just the only difference is what u make out of it,btohqsg
I have this RJC as my NS  partner,btohqsg
Had to clean his shit sometimes when he throw attitude,btohqsg
But hes a really smart fella,btohqsg

EJ gonna be the new AJ,btohqsg
took me 5 seconds to realise ej is eunoia,btohqsg
i was thinking abt smth else üòè,btohqsg
they are increasing jae intake next year,btohqsg
i heard dunman is also open for o lvls intakes tho is it true?,btohqsg
they merged a few jcs and opened a few new options,btohqsg
tbh i think the main diff in resource is the teachers? my  jc chem teacher was a huge fking goof ball,btohqsg
i have never hated any teacher except for her,btohqsg
Not specifically for Econs but haven‚Äôt you heard things likeDon‚Äôt share with other classDon‚Äôt share with other schoolHow can there be equal access to resources if there exists such institutional tribalism? Heck  some sch even so free to create a different version of answer key for sharing and for own students. How is this equal access to resources? This one my reference is Econs.,btohqsg
i have nvr heard those but ok,btohqsg
that has nth to do with access to resource alr thats more like breaching of copyright,btohqsg
I know for a fact batches before me PJ CSE cohort got in trouble with sharing material with external friends,btohqsg
welp im more than willing to sell my econs notes,btohqsg
it has my unique designs of doodles so its my own copyrighted notes :D,btohqsg
But still  the fact that you have the time to create 2 versions,btohqsg
Is A levels a test of access to resources or studehts thinking sia,btohqsg
