I'm not. I have a feeling it's deliberate .. I applied just before the singsaver promo went public so I wasn't entitled to it.,btohqsg

Trying to hit higher interests in my dbs multiplier. Is paying insurance premiums considered an eligible credit card transaction?,btohqsg
Wallet value limit is at $5k. Other than that  all other limits are transaction limits.,btohqsg
The balance will be transferred to main card's balance at end of statement month,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s my understanding too. In other words  if one can consume $10k a month  the topping up limit in theory would be up to $15k,btohqsg
