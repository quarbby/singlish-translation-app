Mazda is underrated in this region. I agree for the same amount of money  Mazda gives better interior built quality and styling though the later is subjective,btohqsg
I don't disagree. If compare to other 2L NA similar segment  it isn't,btohqsg
More then enough for daily commute car la,btohqsg
Skyactiv need to tune for driveability  from factory it is slow in the low and mid end,btohqsg
Hello does anyone know the procedure for buying onsgcarmart.comim in Zimbabwe africa,btohqsg
where the admin hahaha this one sus,btohqsg
Will delete  ban and report if it becomes something,btohqsg
you mean you can do better than mazda factory? how?,btohqsg
"you buy a car to tune to get more ""power""?",btohqsg
please dont believe in this kind of crap,btohqsg
if you buy a high performance machine like a m3 m5 911 gt3 etc then you can do this meaningfully,btohqsg
Factory tune for all fuel... You tune for 98 then come and tell us whether mazda left any power on the table?,btohqsg
what power do you want? how much power do you think you can get from a modest skyactiv 2.0?,btohqsg
some cars can have significantly better drive even with a tune,btohqsg
uh  manufacturers tend to de tune their cars to pass emissions  have better fuel economy  etc.,btohqsg
No one tunes for power here...bhp is useless. People tune for torque  to overtake hoggers with tight gaps,btohqsg
other peoples car let them tune  luh  don’t affect you also right? no need find problem with other peoples decision cos you mazda purist,btohqsg
so in reality one can do a basic tune and get some more power  or tune the gearbox to their liking as well. Very common with ZF gearboxes if you've heard of them,btohqsg
torque can help improve daily driving more then u think even,btohqsg
i am not a mazda purist.,btohqsg
i want to know what engine you have tuned meaningfully,btohqsg
torque helps you when you have 5 grown men sitting in a 1.5L diesel hatchback,btohqsg
Actually pls don't go tune a stock ride then say no power. Need to have hardware changed like intake  exos  or even more like fast road cams,btohqsg
power is the thing helping you accelerate faster,btohqsg
thank you for the education  but we know what torque and power is,btohqsg
shush not everyone is as knowledgeable as you boomer,btohqsg
so if you know how good the increase of torque is in certain applications  why so frustrated?,btohqsg
you ahev been giving wrong info anyway,btohqsg
is people tune want their own car leh not ur car also,btohqsg
Only can buy mazdas for foreigners,btohqsg
i am not frustrated. i am just asking what meaningful increase do you get from a 2 liter mazda 3 engine,btohqsg
Actually what helps you accelerate faster is torque haha.. power which is bhp is the total torque X rpm  which is why bhp is usually at certain rpms,btohqsg
tuned a volvo for better driveability  got better fuel consumption!,btohqsg
If you feel you cannot pump 98 minimum then don't. Stick to the low Ron map of your ecu,btohqsg
Buy an ev save the trouble,btohqsg
Yes tuned my Mazda last time even 1.5 SkyG better FC and power. Changed some hardware of course  not for power but much more driveable after that,btohqsg
how much did you spend on this,btohqsg
honestly a lot of singaporeans don’t just tune for power. but also better drivability,btohqsg
But that was the past  now driving TC  can tune even more esp with boost lol,btohqsg
torque is important but rpm is also ma  that's why tuning optimizes the air fuel ratio at certain RPM to maximise power,btohqsg
but  for goods haulage power is not important,btohqsg
Well yes but a factory stock Mazda engine only has power at 4k onwards haha... Not sustainable,btohqsg
anyway just tune for pops and bangs and annoy boomers la. no need power. accelerate so fast also can't beat red light,btohqsg
So we lower the band to 2k  high end suffers but who drives a 1.5 Sky for high end anyway,btohqsg
thats why tune for torque low down  btr fc!,btohqsg
summon all the getgo drivers 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Ya la.. with the PHV driving same model  changed at the next opportunity haha,btohqsg
mazda is made for low revv driving. 2400 rpm at 120 kmh. to get more power got to drive it hard near redline.,btohqsg
2.4k at 120 is not low btw,btohqsg
I just joined back to give your comment a like 👍🏻,btohqsg
my m2 is doing 3000 rpm at 120kmh,btohqsg
Bye before someone calls me a juvenile 🥱🥱,btohqsg
Haha ya  my current engine is 1.5k at 120  that's low 😉,btohqsg
That is actually terrible. What gear are you on...,btohqsg
if ur M2 3000rpm at 120  u go ws rectify bro,btohqsg
gear 7 m3 3000 rpm at 120kmhgear 6 mazda 6 2400 rpm at 120kmh,btohqsg
both abotu the same weight 1550,btohqsg
you sure you driving mazda and m3 not porsche ah bro? your definition of redline seems a bit high,btohqsg
higher. it wants you to do high. anything at 5000+ is kinda common.,btohqsg
mazda 3 or bmw m3 damn big difference,btohqsg
e30 good too hor don’t play play dtm legend ah sia,btohqsg
the petrol kiosk your second home?,btohqsg
that is why i dont want to drive it often. only once a week,btohqsg
uh  I think need to visit a different workshop already if your rpm is 5000 common when driving in auto,btohqsg
wow that’s a funny joke haha,btohqsg
I will pray for your engine and gearbox,btohqsg
go ahead with your naivety #2,btohqsg
shows you dont know cars high performance machines,btohqsg
you mean doing5000-6000rpms will destroy engine? sure if oil is not hot!,btohqsg
maybe those honda type r at 8000+ wont last too,btohqsg
hows your transmission oil going? can sell as slushy to 7-11?,btohqsg
i will tell you - i blast my 1990 e30 at6200-6000rpm redline since 1990! and it is as good as ever! it cannot be better and it is great,btohqsg
and i can show you the internals what it looks like when open,btohqsg
the camshafts  the pistons  the rod bearings etc,btohqsg
the key is good oil and not about high revv... the engine loves to revv high,btohqsg
when oil is good and hot  it is safe to revv high to redline.,btohqsg
thanks for your recommendation  will not change transmission oil till my coe end,btohqsg

BMW iX1 completes dynamic testingThe BMW iX1 will be available with all-wheel drive  with an electric motor each at its front and rear axle.Do you prefer the all-wheel drive iX1 or the rear-wheel drive iX3?🤔👉🏻 React with 👍🏻 if you prefer the BMW iX1!👉🏻 React with 😁 if you prefer the BMW iX3!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
i am not a fan of EV.. good for city driving only,btohqsg
were you the one who went?,btohqsg
X6M is a really awesome car! muscular with good perforamance,btohqsg
ive seen TT of it offroading too😂😂,btohqsg
Wah ngl X6M rly look like tank sia,btohqsg
exactly! will see sgcm review it?,btohqsg
Yes... available in telegram. Whatapp there's one for Punggol/Sengkang. Search Civic X SG in FB for leads,btohqsg
X5M or M3 M40i my favourite,btohqsg
We will definitely let you know if they ever do a review of the X6M!,btohqsg
I see it in my tiny rear view mirror I faster put hazard light and give way. That is one X you don’t want to mess with…,btohqsg
what if it is secretly a tank 😳 soon you'll see SAF bulk order,btohqsg
probably still cheaper than the tanks our SAF use haha,btohqsg
paired with a good gearbox  simply lovely,btohqsg
for a luX tank like this  I prefer the GLS600,btohqsg
Which do yall prefer? The X6M or GLE63 AMG?🤔,btohqsg
im a merc fan sooo... gle63 amg 🤭 I don't really like the body shape of the X series,btohqsg
Any other options yall wanna include?,btohqsg
think cayenne turbo will be good competitor hahah,btohqsg
tough pick! but i would be happy with any of those 2!!,btohqsg
Price bracket lah sir.. disclaimer: not attacking you ah,btohqsg
admin (probably) deciding life choices on which one he prefers now 🤣,btohqsg
you own e63 don’t pretend la haha,btohqsg
Do you mean look wise or value?,btohqsg
Would be interesting to have a poll done,btohqsg
X6M  RSQ8  Stelvio QV  GLE63s  Cayenne Turbo,btohqsg
good shout! pretty sure its a competitor too,btohqsg
A bit off the price range?,btohqsg
most of the stuff is 600k+,btohqsg
Diesel can bah. Not too X.,btohqsg
but ya haha  underdog then? :P,btohqsg
not really  then need to compare what it competes with instead like cayenne base  q8  etc,btohqsg
not the higher performance variants of these,btohqsg
Someone sure come add Tesla Model X,btohqsg
coe 21k cheaper hit 600+k lor😂😂,btohqsg
Have y'all seen a Tesla Model X on our road before?,btohqsg
All between 650 to 750 ish depending on options as well,btohqsg
Only seen on YouTube by Germaine Tan,btohqsg
like a spaceship with wheels lol,btohqsg
if only singapore had more Model S,btohqsg
How was it in person? As impressive as looking at it through the screen?😆,btohqsg
I’ve been in one in HK,btohqsg
More impressive haha  those gull wing doors.,btohqsg
Definitely a cool piece of technology though,btohqsg
Gaps and didn’t feel that impressive closer up both look and feel wise.,btohqsg
Still very impressed by how those doors open up in tight spaces. Maybe can't fit in some of our MCP though,btohqsg
Just my personal opinion lah. Wonder if they have memory functions that limit how high they open?,btohqsg
the X is really quiet tho! been in an s x and 3 and the x is still my favourite,btohqsg
I can’t really compare coz when I was in one  we were mainly crawling through city traffic from hotel to restaurant,btohqsg
ahhh  hopefully tesla sg brings the X and S in soon,btohqsg
Just curious - are there things to mod on ev? Performance mods or like tuning?,btohqsg
stage one will be useless in this case sadly,btohqsg
but rims can make a ev look damn sick,btohqsg
Got ar u can google track,btohqsg
Many many carbon fibre for upgrade,btohqsg
i scared i say i get yellow card,btohqsg
but its bui bui forever alone,btohqsg
wah this one diff breed alr,btohqsg
Software nothing liao we are at stage 4,btohqsg
can put more motors on the car anot😂😂😵‍💫😵‍💫,btohqsg
naturally a lot of torque also,btohqsg
maybe the ecu remap the battery to stage one when press that button haha,btohqsg
No just scare when I floor,btohqsg
I saw some Model 3 installing coilover on their ride👀,btohqsg
But I like to floor v tec kick in yoz,btohqsg
vorsteiner kit looks super good when bagged tho,btohqsg
Flooring car is the best enjoyment whole driving,btohqsg
come let me send the tesla widebody,btohqsg
how to floor and dont speed.. u floor for 1 second ah😂😂,btohqsg
See black seat no nice le,btohqsg
I saw one with bodykit n gt wing lately n tinted head n tail lamps. Lime green colour,btohqsg
yeah white seats best i agree,btohqsg
uncle elon got put hydrophobic coating,btohqsg
Would like to share about my encounter with those big trucks on the road  don't know if this is the correct forum to discuss.,btohqsg
why not? we discuss everything automotive related!,btohqsg
Many times  these big trucks carry the mud from the construction sites and would drip the mud on the road. Had contacted LTA but was directed to NEA. Then NEA not doing anything... haiz our road now becomes very dirty and muddy,btohqsg
The rain will wash the mud to the side of the road and clog the drain,btohqsg
unpopular opinion: I think without spoiler nicer🤭,btohqsg
bobian bro  lta nowadays so relaxed.. all camping at kallang.. ive seen small stones fly off from the back of the tipper truck,btohqsg
Agree. There was a time I was travelling on TPE and the stone from the truck hit my car side window. I was on lane 2 and the truck on lane 3.,btohqsg
As I frequently drive on changi costal Road  the truck will occupy all 4 lanes 🤦,btohqsg
Don't know why can't they keep to the left....,btohqsg
wah that one abit too much  take vid send to bcl still can earn $50 leh😂😂,btohqsg
No use leh  the traffic police not doing anything,btohqsg
Even got speed cam  they can overtake me and was speeding,btohqsg
Dk kenna hw many stone chip at changi costal rd alrdy..,btohqsg
That road speed limit is 60km/h,btohqsg
Really I hope to see the authority give them fine.,btohqsg
catch legally modified cars driving together nowadays only 🥲,btohqsg
So many idiots on the road but they no where to be seen.. illegal escooters  cyclist on eway etc,btohqsg
Precisely  my exhaust had a tip attached to it  traffic Police also stop me and bend down to check my exhaust.... 😅,btohqsg
He want to smell ur exhaust,btohqsg
When the Ateos doing their duty  all pmd gone,btohqsg
Anyway if anyone know how to officially log a case for these truck  let me know. Thanks.,btohqsg
Social media is king now aday. Esp once go viral.l,btohqsg
Careful .. you might get yellow card. Wait.. you’re the referee! 😬😬😬😬😬,btohqsg
Don’t like that leh…I also never ridicule anyone😰,btohqsg
People easily hurt these days mah. Onroad and online,btohqsg
you offending the referee? later you get red card and 3 match ban!,btohqsg
But hor meet in person  actually all very nice people one.,btohqsg
I think TP website has a section you can submit a report and photos/videos,btohqsg
Mr Xun  I hope not though as I like to spread my good and positive vibes around.,btohqsg
I am offended by this statement  are you trying to imply that i spread negative vibes?#DriveSlowDriveSafe,btohqsg
Sorry sorry Mr Xun. Non intended at all. I do love your comments on Volvo cars. You really seem very truly knowledgeable about them. One day when I grow up I’d like to be like you.,btohqsg
Did you know that you can submit your video footage to our admin too and if our writers pick up the story  you'll get $10 PayNow?,btohqsg
I actually didn’t know this! Wait.. rather than submit complain footages  can we submit positive behaviour footages and still get $10?,btohqsg
If we write about in MyCarForum  yeah you'll get the $10 PayNow,btohqsg
can do more then once not haha,btohqsg
Provided no yellow card I think,btohqsg
But the writers won't pick up every story of course. They'll pick the ones that they think will go viral,btohqsg
If they do all  shag sia,btohqsg
I really see some good behaviour I’d really like to compliment when I take bus sometimes,btohqsg
I am honoured that you appreciate my love for Volvo Cars. Volvo is a company from Sweden that make beautiful tanks. Volvo is dubbed at one of the safest automobiles to grave the road. Volvo servicing interval is 15 000km but i just brought mine in at 10 000km today.#KeepUpWithYourMaintenance. I hope that one day you will be able to achieve your dream of owning a#TANKin singapore.,btohqsg
Wow. The Singaporean dream Mr Xun. Two cars .. and one being e63. which Volvo do you have Mr Xun?,btohqsg
Did you know Volvo was the first car maker to invent the safety belt we have in every car! Volvo could have patented the seatbelt but because volvo believed the seatbelt will save many lives  they decided to allow other car manufacturers to install it in its cars,btohqsg
why not do away with spoiler? looks neat without it.,btohqsg
Volvo is a safe car. Even the emblem wears a seatbelt.,btohqsg
definitely  was feeling tht the car was abit rough hence decided to bring it early for a full servicing,btohqsg
XC40 T4 R-Design! versatile and stylish car for city driving!,btohqsg
Haha looks similar  but Volvo's logo is the chemical symbol for IRON💪💪,btohqsg
I always thought it’s a Man symbol!,btohqsg
Yes I did try but no response from TP,btohqsg
Mr Xun you’re really legit. You really share about your ride when we ask about it.,btohqsg
Now we know there is a $10 option.,btohqsg
Obviously Mr Anwo  lies will be exposed sooner or later! Another thing that doesnt lie is Volvo's stellar safety rating!,btohqsg
May I suggest more pics until the current gen perhaps? I think they call it … key design elements? I don’t know I’m not an expert like you guys…,btohqsg
Ohhhh I thought you do also. So you’re helping to encourage all of us to go green lah… like help think of the environment!,btohqsg
Offtopic qns: is sgcarmart quotz or motorist quote better 😅,btohqsg
You have my respect Mr Xun. I shall memorise this first line for exam.,btohqsg
First rule is to introduce yourself and ride but i have yet to see yours 🫠🫠,btohqsg
Hello  Sam here. Driving 2021 Vezel,btohqsg
2021 vezel Is that the new vezel?How’s the drive,btohqsg
Congratulations on the car.  It is so new!,btohqsg
the smell of new car must be so lovely.,btohqsg
Tesla X gull wing doors might not be practical for our MSCP  where space and height are constraints.,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBmfKvUh_mMa bit weird to hear exhaust sound on an electric car lol,btohqsg
does sound nicer than chicken wing,btohqsg
Yeaps  it’s a little quieter than the old one. I ended up doing sound proof for 4x wheel well and 4x door  change to primacy 4  and gonna do trunk and rear door next.,btohqsg
falcon bigger than chicken so more meat lor haha,btohqsg
Naw  hybrid was 38k extra. Cannot justify the price.,btohqsg
wow that is legit commitment sir.,btohqsg
Sliding doors might be better. But to van like.,btohqsg
i know a lot of people who have driven cars with sliding doors and swear never to go back to cars with normal doors.,btohqsg
Yah. Tesla X more slick than Alphard,btohqsg
Depending on where it slide to? Some retract downwards,btohqsg
However  Alphard is damn spacious and luxury if you can upgrade!,btohqsg
wow  after retracting downwards  need to have red carpet roll out,btohqsg
But our carparks are getting smaller 😭,btohqsg
Our lanes are also so narrow,btohqsg
that's why i love the toyota sienta,btohqsg
Honestly our roads are not bike friendly,btohqsg
Wew  i prefer the freed to sienta,btohqsg
The distance to Open is actually very little,btohqsg
But can’t win sliding door but sure is better then our door,btohqsg
Some CDB parking lot are much worst. Wonder how Rolls Royce owner parked their car? Or sorry  chances are they have chauffeur.,btohqsg
it might be the height i am more concerned about and honestly in some carparks  it is running dangerously close to another car liao,btohqsg
normal doors at least i can hold and slide out?,btohqsg
LTA not approved leh apparently. or so I have read... I might be wrong,btohqsg
They dun park. Alight at door step and the chauffeur drives off,btohqsg
Huh y not approve only speaker,btohqsg
noise disturbance? or something like that following complaints from public.,btohqsg
Yah right. Forgot they have they Lambo or Ferrari in their garage too,btohqsg
best seat to enjoy this car which one has paid serious money for is probably in the back?,btohqsg
No leh lol if I buy I also don’t have lambo or Ferrari,btohqsg
the headliner and all the creature comforts,btohqsg
Dk abt that thou. Hw is it more irritating than a screaming lambo or harley lol,btohqsg
NEWS: Toyota on Wednesday reported a 33% fall in quarterly profit; The world's biggest automaker by sales posted an operating profit of $3.56 billion in Q1  below an average estimate of $4B from seven analysts surveyed by Refinitiv.,btohqsg
it is a modification vs stock from factory question I am guessing,btohqsg
One day maybe SG will have major Blackout like YEars ago cause of overcharging,btohqsg
i wouldn't jump at that conclusion necessarily sir,btohqsg
They wont care as long as they earns.,btohqsg
Sales figure did show ev adoption is gaining pace,btohqsg
Mr Xun  how do you seem to have all the answers! And all with concrete evidence one instead of just say,btohqsg
i am not amber heard lawyer  no hearsays!,btohqsg
That is primarily due to the surge in model 3 deliveries that had been on order for a long time,btohqsg
You Xun zhao da an (search for answers),btohqsg
It is gaining but not high yet,btohqsg
Other brand also manufactured ev and it is world sales figure   most of the nation are pushing for ev and it is generally there will be more and more ev on the road,btohqsg
This is not about brand   but generally ev On a whole in the worldhttps://www.statista.com/chart/amp/26845/global-electric-car-sales/,btohqsg
But are they helping? Not too sure about that one,btohqsg
what if we add toyota to this list hahaha,btohqsg
Ya can add but Toyota sales figure is indeed declining that why they are going into ev too to fight market share,btohqsg
How to sell my car online?,btohqsg
But Toyota is defiantly inside as this is about ev not about brand,btohqsg
you have sort of come to the right place.,btohqsg
100 ev sold in sg   can be 100 Toyotas or 0 Toyota it does not matter   statistic is about ev,btohqsg
Toyota don't have a completely electric model apart from one,btohqsg
Ya I don’t understand why u think Toyota don’t have ev,btohqsg
apart frm one* he say hahaha,btohqsg
think my point is  if you add internal combustion cars the sales figure will cfm be damn high  ALTHOUGH i do agree ev is doing well,btohqsg
And this one not on sale yet also,btohqsg
To what the profit and lost Toyota announce ?,btohqsg
aiyo that’s not my point la,btohqsg
Very good process! Can auction with sgcm also!! Good price,btohqsg
example of how if you add petrol cars to the infographic you sent  the sales will be way higher then EV although yes EV sales are increasing,btohqsg
Maybe it's a bit like saying since BMW USA's 2022 Q1 sales figures are higher than similar quarter last year  Americans are ditching EVs,btohqsg
plus one is volume figures  one is profit numbers,btohqsg
Must also consider that a lot of these people buying EV  especially the European buyers are only buying smaller cars like 500e or mini electric etc. for city use because of congestion charges,btohqsg
If they use their ICE cars need to pay for ULEZ charge and Congestion charges as well which they can get a subsidy on by going electric. But these people tend to have gas guzzlers at home for their weekends and other use,btohqsg
Ya some buy as spare some buy for replacement,btohqsg
Like China top selling car is model y   how many is replacement of ice or how many buy as spare is another thing   and drive which more is also another thing,btohqsg
but i think honestly  majority buy gasoline as their main haha,btohqsg
Here in SG is different. COE plays a big part,btohqsg
If not going for road trip and got home charging most ppl will drive ev,btohqsg
COE still need to pay for EVs  the only rebate is ARF,btohqsg
City driving is good for ev,btohqsg
Ev down side is road trip over 300 km as need to charge,btohqsg
Which will hit you at the end when you go on to scrap because the car will probably not last more than 10 years anyway due to current battery tech,btohqsg
make sense this  but unless they stay private properties  many countries still don’t have a lot of charging points,btohqsg
thought 2021 it was Wuling Hongguang with almost half a million?,btohqsg
Yes   this is well to do ppl privilege   don’t need maintenance don’t need go petrol kiosk,btohqsg
interesting eh haha didn’t know model y was so popular alw thought it was some wuling minivan and vw,btohqsg
which is why i think majority have ICE cars as fault driver still very popular,btohqsg
The downside is the long charging time but the driver behaviour will have to adopt,btohqsg
Meaning to say plan on the road trips,btohqsg
Good mix of micro EVs and bigger ICE cars,btohqsg
The fair thing is that they can afford to own more than one cat a/b vehicles,btohqsg
I charge at work or home,btohqsg
Everything in life is on planning anyway,btohqsg
ahh understand where you coming from now. but this is only for crossovers and suv leh,btohqsg
"Top selling ""crossover"" in March and q1 2022",btohqsg
ev is great but i think no matter how popular tesla is  won’t be too latrust me  i like tesla too but not the most affordable to the mainstream chinese market still,btohqsg
when it comes to this PCC  I tend to take a more erm spontaneous approach.,btohqsg
right maybe miscomm cos u state here best selling car in china ma,btohqsg
U don’t charge full   u charge till 80-90,btohqsg
Like it or not  ev will be a must to get,btohqsg
this is a bit marketing I think... overseas many are taxis.,btohqsg
not that it is bad don't get me wrong. they are good for what they do.,btohqsg
Since you're driving EV  I would actually like to know how much Tesla SG is charging for battery pack replacement should your battery die for any reason or age,btohqsg
Now just have to wait for more incentives to adopt,btohqsg
To me if got landed   ev is the best la for city driving   Eletricity is cheap   easy maintain   1 pedal driving,btohqsg
Incentives will slowly go down though  governments need to earn lost revenue on fuel also,btohqsg
Works best for landed as they probably recharge for free using solar,btohqsg
I tell you easiest car to maintain  Mazda 3!!!!,btohqsg
Isn't there a really long warranty period on the battery?,btohqsg
No pedal driving also can! The adaptive cruise control,btohqsg
there is the upfront cost of installing panels to consider too.,btohqsg
Ice car so many things to maintain,btohqsg
8 years but to them not enough,btohqsg
if we consider % of folks living in landed properties vs apartments  we should seriously look at the charging infrastructure,btohqsg
Also have horror stories of people with first gen model S and X saying that Tesla isn't holding up the warranty,btohqsg
Everything in black and white sue them lol,btohqsg
Yeah I think 8-10 is really good. EV also good for those ppl whose office can install charger.Or wait until gov allow wall plug style chargers even tho that takes forever to charge,btohqsg
Doesn't leave a good taste mah,btohqsg
First ev experience  need to sue here to sue there,btohqsg
I am a petrol head   after drive ev I never look back,btohqsg
It's so nice to drive too  I tried getgo's kona  shiok,btohqsg
Easy to drive   easy to maintain,btohqsg
Power delivery like a motorcycle too  so high torque,btohqsg
Now coal head technically? 😂😂😂 But good man! You are able to get what you love!,btohqsg
My tesla been recall just need to down load need update,btohqsg
Lol   ice is go back to ad lmao,btohqsg
Just that the power dies down after a while with lesser power on the top end,btohqsg
So far we all think our car is too fast,btohqsg
All the cars like not moving,btohqsg
That one I feel in ICE also,btohqsg
because all drive like you.. floor or nothing,btohqsg
Haven't got to try what's the power band like vs ICE,btohqsg
A lot to do with reaction time and how hard you floor it,btohqsg
What car u drive ? Max Lauren 720?,btohqsg
Obviously not as fast as you ev freaks mah,btohqsg
All floor off traffic light here and there,btohqsg
is that what driving EV is about.. deriving pleasure from beating people at traffic lights?,btohqsg
Why need to floor when cars is so fast,btohqsg
i do feel that general behaviour to be honest,btohqsg
i want move ev leh  but coe so expensive. might need sponsor,btohqsg
insurance premiums should be increased for EVs please.,btohqsg
Agree  had a lot of instances where EVs have almost crashed into me because they floor randomly,btohqsg
Already high I am 50% ncd is 2600 a year liao,btohqsg
Ya and road tax is $5300,btohqsg
Road tax isn't it based off emission,btohqsg
No they change to base on horse power,btohqsg
insurance companies either recognise that EVs drive like sports cars  or the accident rates are higher than general,btohqsg
As long as gov don't adjust tax to encourage EV adoption it will still mostly be rich pple toy,btohqsg
you are really not kidding about that??,btohqsg
And the performance is that of some sports cars based on pure numbers,btohqsg
nvm nvm you are saving polar bears,btohqsg
and still smoking people at traffic lights,btohqsg
Standard tesla model 3 the 5s 0-100 acceleration is comparable to supercars already,btohqsg
Owning a car is not about savings but what tangibles saves you,btohqsg
I was being nice Mr Arnav,btohqsg
Eod singaporeans are rich enough to own cars so they can lame but will suck thumb and move on,btohqsg
hopefully the correct type of positive... not the other one mr anwo,btohqsg
In fact sg is good for those who can afford to own more than one car. Stay in hdb and get many lots not like those stay in some condo and have to fight for lots. 😂,btohqsg
Sg car price too high and that is sad,btohqsg
A lot of ppl have to work extra 10-20 years because of that,btohqsg
High yet prices still can climb say much,btohqsg
SMRT taxi hits the brakes on lane 1 of an expressway just before an ERP gantry and causes a chain collision👉 90% sure he stopped there to top up his cashcard❓ So if Cam Car claims insurance from the Mazda 3 and the Mazda 3 claims from the Altis and the Altis claims from the Honda Fit  does that mean the SMRT taxi driver gets away scott-freeWould love to hear some thoughts from the community 🗣Read the articlehere,btohqsg
Don’t play with names. It is just a name if that helps people to identify,btohqsg
Some big organisation already using PCC.,btohqsg
And some might even go there to seek medical,btohqsg
some do it themselves no need seek medical,btohqsg
Seek professional opinions. Eod still your own life to decide,btohqsg
it does help get one's health on track.,btohqsg
Sorry I don’t work in that place just in case someone asking,btohqsg
it is true.  EOD buying any car in Singapore is an achievement. Your ride  your vibe mate!,btohqsg
Thus coe prices will not go down much unless the bulk of us hold on to our $$$,btohqsg
No demand no rise in prices,btohqsg
I think Tesla Model X pretty rare on our roads leh,btohqsg
Not practical in sg context.. cos of parking  height etc,btohqsg
Model S plaid will be probably on the same price range as audi etron,btohqsg
Dont think will come to SG as of now.,btohqsg
Low demand for RHD market  usually american brands delay introduction,btohqsg
Tbh I don’t see any dealers selling Model X right now actly👀,btohqsg
Not even the Hong SEh or sth ? HAHAHAH ok nvm i forget the dealer name,btohqsg
PI will have but will sell at dumb prices,btohqsg
On a side note  the Model Y is expected to launch in SG  Q3 2022!https://m.sgcarmart.com/new_cars/overview.php?CarCode=21506,btohqsg
Looking at 250k For this model INclusive COE?,btohqsg
Road Tax probably 3k a yr,btohqsg
I have no idea how much it is gonna cost tbh😂 I only know you must have deep pockets,btohqsg
Which e-tron are you referring to? There's 4 sir,btohqsg
Just pick one sir  none of the 4 can afford,btohqsg
i mean how to compete with tesla sg la😂😂,btohqsg
Should be inclusive as it is not that far off from model 3 pricing,btohqsg
Maybe a bit higher than 250 though,btohqsg
Model S is the dream thou.. for tesla imo,btohqsg
Have  no ready stock though  must indent. But no one wants because cannot use supercharger,btohqsg
I believe so but when it comes to SG COE sky High hahahaa. 250 is just basic range LOL,btohqsg
Depends on the COE I guess,btohqsg
Lets say car price for model Y to be at 180k?,btohqsg
Should be around that give or take,btohqsg
How can it be omv close 1 eye 63 k for entry level,btohqsg
shld be abt 10% more than 3,btohqsg
Since model 3 performance is close to 170,btohqsg
Lets see when it hit our shores?,btohqsg
hannor  maybe next time tesla come with inbuilt twitter😂😂,btohqsg
NOOOOOO inbuilt Tweeter i ok not Twitter,btohqsg
Ya pi can’t sell   if they sell no warrently no repair,btohqsg
Where has the tesla pi owners been servicing/repairing their cars,btohqsg
I find that to be very rude@SGCM_Adminplease issue yellow card,btohqsg
Before Tesla SG came in Hong Seh sell afew liao enough lah HAHAHAH now they retire tesla those buy PI Tesla cannot charge at Tesla Supercharger So sad. So those buy bf that have to think of a way to change the plug LOL,btohqsg
Hong Seh still says they are selling and they still have ready model 3s in their showroom. But no one wants to buy since Tesla is here already,btohqsg
Its abt the charging port they have is different LOL,btohqsg
Cannot use supercharger as I said here,btohqsg
This is before coe but I get what u mean haha,btohqsg
We were talking about price before COE,btohqsg
Warranty is one Charging is another. Whoever have landed sua get from PI but i think universal wise cannot charge except own house. So they have ready unit also no use LOL whose buying,btohqsg
It bascially very funny   u go service with tesla but hongseh pay for it,btohqsg
Can charge at some sp power outlets as well I think,btohqsg
Any new cars came in after tesla sg is here will be deny all service,btohqsg
They shld have a servicing plan for the pi teslas,btohqsg
Afterall its their car n brand.. 🤔 and these owners willing to own their car even before they coming into the mkt,btohqsg
hi guys anyone without vep manage to drive in to malaysia? any issues?,btohqsg
Not feasible just get from Tesla SG,btohqsg
Got   tesla service for you and u reimburse from pi,btohqsg
They where will cover.. unless its in ur contract when u buy,btohqsg
It is standard   u buy car from dealer and pi  the price is mark up,btohqsg
The servicing package all these is from the mark up u given to them,btohqsg
If not where got free stuff,btohqsg
Bang hoh ownself bid COE they sell u car easy for them LOL,btohqsg
Did a search. Didn't come from our members,btohqsg
haha i not sure must ask mr simple ☝🏼,btohqsg
he ask where to buy tesla frm if not frm PI,btohqsg
Buy from tesla sg themselves the manufacturer,btohqsg
They don’t have pi or ad   they sell to you them self and the bank loan is better   as don’t know to let ad or pi cut,btohqsg
Hi  may I know winners announced already?,btohqsg
Nope  we will be announcing the winners within the next few days!,btohqsg

Woa. Yours? Why u no censor number plate?,btohqsg
I saw a nice car I took photo,btohqsg

Sgcarmart encourages covering plate when posting car for sale also!,btohqsg
And he is a winner of SGCM award,btohqsg
nice car. who is selling this,btohqsg
i think it's your car. you can come up with such story so well... 🤭,btohqsg
or maybe its just basic courtesy to cover ppl plate up so that they can have their privacy😊😊,btohqsg
Any opinion on what is considered high mileage?,btohqsg
depends on the car as well,btohqsg
but for a regular average car 16 to 18k+ getting into the higher territory already,btohqsg
but what matters is total mileage and number of owners as the per year mileage is probably not constant,btohqsg
I did 320k in 5 years on my first car. Now doing about 35k each year but friends tell me my mileage is high,btohqsg
uhh its okay  i 1 year 40k. what matters most is you keep up with your maint,btohqsg
what car are you driving? intrigued to know what's lasted you 320k,btohqsg
It's like half of what I was driving,btohqsg
depends on how you maintain and drive honestly and what is the reputation of the car's engine. I would consider anything above 20k a year to be high in Singapore but I know people who consider 12k+ to be high also,btohqsg
Yeah.. Was young and enjoyed driving. Drove to phuket twice,btohqsg
good  means car is serving you well👍👍,btohqsg
and if it has lasted this long without any major issues  just expected part replacements and maintenance  that means you take care of it well too!,btohqsg
I remember once my wife was telling me about pasar malam in cck. Then I told her sg pasar malam not good to Jalan. We drove to petaling one hr later,btohqsg
I changed a lot of parts.,btohqsg
most modern cars  if well maintained the engine can last a long time,btohqsg
Now cannot. Drive 1.5 hr buay tahan,btohqsg
Toyota derived engines usually highest rated in this case,btohqsg
Actually chery I think is very underrated for the brand. The engine is very rugged. Rough but tough,btohqsg
Toyota engines have lasted well over 400k kms in many cases! good engines,btohqsg
Biggest part I changed was the oil tank  leaking. Otherwise all wearable parts,btohqsg
Quite a few of the Chery engines are based on toyota engines as well,btohqsg
The one I had I think was Austria engine  not Toyota,btohqsg
Nice! Still have the car or moved onto something different already?,btohqsg
Moved on  that was 15 years ago,btohqsg
So back to original question  35k is acceptable right?,btohqsg
just depends on your own view honestly,btohqsg
for resale purposes  it might not look the best but if the car is well maintained and you find the right buyer  why not,btohqsg
I personally hit around 19 to 22k only,btohqsg
I mean some buy cars to keep mileage low for resale but personally I feel if I do it this way  I'm not doing my car justice😂,btohqsg
I mean I don't buy for the purpose of selling. Not sure if i make sense,btohqsg
I bought my current coe car at 70k  now at 240k,btohqsg
Anyway coe car has no value so I just enjoy driving it,btohqsg
driving is a pleasure for me,btohqsg
35k a year is considered high. but it is well worth the use. high mileague aint matter if car is well maintained and parts are changed when due.,btohqsg
for my 1990 car which i purchased in 2004  i am still using original exhaust. old stuff lasts along time. no leaks no rusts. amazing long lasting old bmw,btohqsg
let's drive to chiangmai and tibet,btohqsg
Very unsure whether this is spam or not. What do you all think?,btohqsg
totally. i buy a car to drive to enjoy. i dont care much about resale or popular opinion.,btohqsg
Anybody knows how to change spare tire….@Redhill.,btohqsg
Under such anti China sentiment propagated by U.S.  anything coming from China are no good.Chery owned Volvo now,btohqsg
I applauded your mileage clocked by a Chery. Cars are mend to be driven right? Mileage high means you have make full used of the car compared to someone’s car been park in a carpark lot somewhere.,btohqsg
Personally  I clocked in 100k within three years of the cars I bought so far.,btohqsg
Good man  sir!! 👍🏼 yes no garage queens for sure! Fully support what you’re saying. For a small country like ours  we really over emphasise on mileage sometimes when the cars are built for way higher distances like overseas. What’s even more important is how the car has been maintained.,btohqsg
Yes that is the right mindset. A car is a tool. Enjoy using the tool,btohqsg
I put in about 22-25K consistently per year and every time I sell my car  they would always exclaim that its high mileage. But if you have a car at such high depreciation and don't use  what's the point! Perhaps its exactly the fact that cars are costly and that's why we Singapore drivers are consistently putting in more mileage  else its a waste to put it in the car park and take public transport.,btohqsg
Legit very impressed. Which 1990 bmw are you driving today sir. Can share the details pls? Sounds like in addition to alfa romeo  you are also bmw lover!!!! for a while I thought you were an EV owner.,btohqsg
"By the way  with all the ""false"" reporting of mileage on resale cars  what's your way of combating it when purchasing a resale car?",btohqsg
Most cars store it in the ECU,btohqsg
Can share a pic of your car front pls? I’m such a fan. I have so many questions about buying older bmw that I would love to consult you!,btohqsg
Oh. So that's a way to tell the actual mileage?,btohqsg
but as the mileage increase to like 400-500k  do expect some deviation ah because its not dead accurate,btohqsg
Thanks! Learnt something new this morning! 😁,btohqsg
So I guess  die die also must get the car dealer to release the car for own workshop pre-inspection,btohqsg
Haha welcome! learnt this while overseas because mileage tampering is very common elsewhere,btohqsg
haha any used car you buy  you should always do PPI. Sometimes a known to be reliable car will not be reliable if proper maintenance is not done :),btohqsg
My experience in selling my car is that   whenever I see my previous car show up in ads   the mileage will be lower even thou is already low,btohqsg
Guess its both ways to be honest. If buyers are not picky about mileage  then dealers won't have to resort to these things to tweak the mileage.,btohqsg
maybe best is to buy used ad cars,btohqsg
Haha yep. Most singaporeans correlate mileage to condition of the car which is very misleading.,btohqsg
Ah. I seldom keep track when my car is cleared off my hands. Maybe should make a mental note to follow-up and see!,btohqsg
their servicing record is more trustable,btohqsg
Yes it kinda fun and u be surprise  but so far I never see they use lady owner on me before :(,btohqsg
I have seen careful male owner before😂😂,btohqsg
"Haha. The ""Retired Female Teacher"" kind of text.",btohqsg
All these one female owner ads…. Last time in the 90s and early 2000s…. Used to be Malay owner,btohqsg
Don’t accept just STA cert if you can help it.,btohqsg
Sometimes they don’t allow until you pay a deposit.,btohqsg
Yes. Quite a number are like that and getting back the deposit is going to be painful.,btohqsg
Seriously  isn't there a market for a good reliable 2nd hand car dealer that does not employ all these weird grey book methods?,btohqsg
Up to one whether he or she chooses to accept it but in my mind nothing is that precious or urgent to take the risk of a major maintenance bill shortly after taking ownership of car.,btohqsg
Based on the trade-in price and the selling price  there is sufficient margin to make a living. Yes  every business is to make money but I feel  make money already also must be able to sleep at night mah.,btohqsg
Ya if they insist on deposit before allowing me to send for inspection  I’ll just walk out,btohqsg
Yup… always be prepared to walk away,btohqsg
Of course dealers will give you dealer job to clean up the car so everything looks pretty and clean on initial visual inspection. Nothing wrong with this as all industries do this to make sales.,btohqsg
Sick of all their tricks and football ⚽️ money/adminfee etc etc,btohqsg
Everyone must make a living la.. 😃,btohqsg
Any experience with Carro? (Sorry if its not allowed to mention specific names). I see that their cars are usually high mileage ones,btohqsg
I know but it’s just quite well… I would say that it always leave a bad taste… just when u thot u hd a decent deal then have this extra money slappedOn,btohqsg
Yes! Admin fee plus add-on for warranty etc.,btohqsg
So back to buyer due diligence bah.. it’s bad enough hardly any test drives are allowed for used cars.,btohqsg
Not like buying t shirt leh,btohqsg
Buyer can hardly do any due D except visual   start up…..test drive  for short distance w/o what deposit is a MUST,btohqsg
Wait.. even then I am not required to place deposit before trying 😅😅,btohqsg
This is not accurate. That’s for very modern cars.,btohqsg
Ohhh I really thought most after say 2010 have liao,btohqsg
Many cars even in 2000s have simple mechanisms of using analogue methods,btohqsg
yeah post 1990 they can also be stored in the bcm,btohqsg
But again to be fair. There are also many “buyers” who call up  poke poke and test drive car for fun without actual real intention of buying too.,btohqsg
Seen too many of such people around,btohqsg
Good morning Mr Xun! You have lovely dogs!,btohqsg
Thanks Mr Anwo  you have a lovely dog too!,btohqsg
Hard to say for all bah.. but I’ve heard they transact fast.,btohqsg
At least from the one dude I know who sold them his car.,btohqsg
Mileage tempering for many sports cars is hard. For instance  in order to tweak bmw mileage you need to authenticate with many components not just in the DME. This is good. But makes things complex. In England  tempering is a criminal office. Can go to jail.,btohqsg
Tempering with intent to mislead a buyer in a sale is.,btohqsg
Or  to under declare a car value on importation for customs purposes.,btohqsg
But Singapore generally safe bah 😅,btohqsg
Tempering with intent? What other forms of tempering is considered okay?,btohqsg
Since you said it this way why do you want to temper,btohqsg
That’s why it’s difficult to tweak the mileage,btohqsg
Just walk away le  but sometimes when the car and price really attractive it's hard,btohqsg
I would walk away. Very scary when I don’t know what I don’t know,btohqsg
I thought maybe I could buy a 2nd hand car  fix it up  replace all wearable parts  then put it on sale with all the servicing done and replaced  but I feel I would be penalised by what I did because buyers would siam the car thinking it must be problematic that's why replace so many parts,btohqsg
I think being an honest car dealer would suffer actually,btohqsg
Especially the costs of replacement would jack up the market price of the car I'm selling  buyers wouldn't be convinced to spend that kind of money,btohqsg
I guess to summarize  such market doesn't exist and unable to,btohqsg
We see it in apple care etc too. Nothing wrong with it per se.. quite a question of one’s risk appetite. A bit like buying insurance? down to each person’s cost/benefit analysis in a way.,btohqsg
E.g. I am a 3rd owner of vezel hybrid  which my agent lied that it's not a phv car and mileage is 60k when I took over. If I replace all parts  paint it according to the color buyer wants  sell at $62k  would anyone want to buy it from me? I'm sure no.,btohqsg
Overseas yes for collectible cars  they restore  mark up and sell.,btohqsg
So many retired female Teachers 😂,btohqsg
Most agent wan trade in at 10k difference so that they can maximize earning,btohqsg
Got dealer told me most customers take them for a ride (literally)  there's a risk of damage if too many such customers drive then walk off,btohqsg
My mechanic friend used to advise me  never ever test drive a second hand car from dealer if you are not genuinely interested to buy. Once you get into an accident  you will have to pay for all the damage incurred.,btohqsg
Especially if the accident is staged rite,btohqsg
Guess they will purposely rectify other damages that might not directly link to the immediate accident.,btohqsg
Maybe I'll start as a 2nd hand dealer without any physical office  then see how it works out by being an honest seller lol,btohqsg
I guess there will be people that are price sensitive but I think there are people whom will be willing to pay a little more for a trouble-free experience. Consider something as simple as transfer of ownership.  Even with bank order  the transfer of ownership is usually done only after the bank's order is cleared. That's already a risk. Perhaps one can consider something like a 3rd party Escrow service.,btohqsg
"With apple care  we know what we are getting and everything is listed clear. However  with regards to the specific advertisement that I responded to  it stated ""1 year in-house warranty on engine and gear-box""  then when nego  the warranty becomes an add on item and cost.",btohqsg
That’s also a good point. Inclusions / Exclusions.,btohqsg
If possible  please share your experience! Maybe I can come and part-time with you. Guess in this case  it is not so much about the volume of business but rather the fact that you see a gap that can be fulfilled.,btohqsg
"Take the ""in-house warranty"" with a pinch of salt. The techs  garages and dealers are all partners.Now guess who isn't a member of this circle of trust?",btohqsg
"I understand that the ad space on SGCARMART is limited but one could put ""1 year warranty on engine+gearbox addon"". That would work too!",btohqsg
Honda ZR-V announced for EuropeThe ZR-V is currently set to go on sale in the European market in 2022  so we won't be seeing it on our roads any time soon😰👉🏻 React with 😢 if you are bummed out that we won't be seeing the ZR-V on our roads any time soon!👉🏻 React with 🥰 if you are looking forward to the ZR-V launch in Singapore!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Make sure to get your back end really sorted before starting 😁 (parts access and costs  workshop for touch up jobs  proper records of verifiable parts  financing costs etc) otherwise your holding costs will be a bit siong,btohqsg
True true. Its like the SGCARMART warranty thing. Would you see it as a advantage over others? Some dealers are promoting that as an addon as well. They can buy for you.,btohqsg
Shit. I realised that this SGMCART's chat. I hope I don't get called up for a kopi session for stating this.,btohqsg
Start by helping friends source for cars as first deals. That sure beats opening up a biz even if virtual waiting for the first customer.,btohqsg
You know when suddenly you’re no longer in this group chat 😃😃,btohqsg
There's one that I have seen online. HEW Motor. I think he is a one-man operation and he does something similar. He has tie-ups with his own workshop but he replaces quite a bit of stuff before reselling.,btohqsg
I'm not in the position to comment as I've never read the fine print of this warranty programme.,btohqsg
Like putting the ownership to a 3rd party for holding  so that the seller cannot chood pattern?,btohqsg
"And the warranty is usually additional costs for next year cos the workshop usually ""unable"" to fix the problem  then when you fix it outside  they tell you the warranty no pah Keh",btohqsg
Escrow? Yes. Arrangement which 3rd party temporarily holds money or property until a particular condition has been met,btohqsg
I no experience as a dealer lol but perhaps can use consumer mindset to guide myself lol. It's a very small gap no one wants to risk lol cos mostly trusts issues.,btohqsg
Can work but honestly I've seen dealers working out of mscps and no offices having a hard time to sell the cars they have,btohqsg
Guess one of the biggest mystery is what license is required so that one can take ownership of the car without increasing the transfer count. Understand the outlay in cash to purchase the car first but transfer count?,btohqsg
"Because the customer already ""degrades"" your unit in comparison to a dealer who has a brick and mortar office and forecourt",btohqsg
It's like buying veggies from small shop at the corner or going to cold storage,btohqsg
Different consumers  different levels of comfort,btohqsg
"Searched ""used car escrow singapore"" and found this onlinehttps://diycars.com/Not related to them in any way but its interesting that they listed $100 000 escrow service. Not many in Singapore do this.",btohqsg
I would scrap warranty but would recommend where to service or fix lol...that's where chat group is important,btohqsg
"Actually not that hard as more and more workshops have access to obd tools to read car ECUs and access information. Alongside this  a lot of ""authorized dealers"" themselves have been caught Rolling back miles around the world. One such example is Ferrari dealers and Porsche dealers  and they are able to do so with pretty much all their cars  old or modern.For the older cars  it may be harder to detect if anyone has tampered with the odometer however if you go to a specialist workshop to conduct your PPI  they are able to tell this by using other methods of physical verification",btohqsg
Valid point. But I guess it depends on the scale of the business. If you are not looking at quantity and doing it to fill a gap  then I think it might be possible.,btohqsg
Yupp  can be possible. If you know your car's and products well and can make the customer trust you  anything is possible,btohqsg
Yeah a lot of planning to do. Do support little bro me then 😂What holding costs are there btw? I can think of road tax  insurance  parking  petrol etc. Any costs relating to the business aside the car? Licence fee?,btohqsg
I've personally seen both types of dealers  those who really know about every car on their forecourt even though most used car dealers don't. And also those who just say  see here is the car  you want or not?,btohqsg
As consumer I see it as additional costs  but if the warranty is tamper proof I would buy such a car,btohqsg
Petrol isn't that big a cost as you wouldn't be driving around that much. Many dealers do keep their cars uninsured as well  that's why if you go by to try and test drive  they say carpark drive only. The other hit you would probably take is the actual depreciation on the car as the longer you hold it  the more money you are losing,btohqsg
LoL I myself also addressed a white elephant earlier about merchants that mark up no. of sales. Let's be honest here and point them out for the admins to look at and address them. Else it's just a chat group for grumbling and lobangs,btohqsg
I think you got most of it but you will need to consider company/business name  accounting  GST  advertisement costs and yes  licence fee. Don't know what  who or how this license works.,btohqsg
Transfer count is also a misconception that devalues a good car,btohqsg
They are mainly a community forum and platform sir. Biz need to run their biz for their investor returns too. I do agree let’s try to reduce grumbling and encourage more factual talk. Lobangs are ok bah… helps readers save money?,btohqsg
LoL I'm that type. If ask me about the car's performance  I would say do your own research cos I find it's pointless to ask when it can be bs by the dealer,btohqsg
And to be realistic  all things mechanical can and do fail and the risk is there from the first engine turn. Important i guess is how the seller works with the buyer to resolve issues.,btohqsg
Oh I see  uninsured is allowed if dealer,btohqsg
But I'm referring more about dealers not knowing about what they have at all like the car  what it's known for  what spec is it  etc. So they don't know about the car  don't know what could be broken before they buy and then they proceed to sell without allowing for PPI,btohqsg
So those are some dealers that I liked to stay away from,btohqsg
I think a responsible dealer would have it checked by the workshop then understand from their technical point of view  the rest lol is such chat group,btohqsg
Sometimes their workshop no good as well,btohqsg
Cannot cater to all cars  so one must really look into the car and the dealer before buying if they're trustworthy or not and how easy it'll be to resolve disputes later,btohqsg
Maybe can have a rating system by dealer’s customers. So potential buyers know what to expect. The industry can also get rid of rotten apples.,btohqsg
Have  Google reviews. Easy to manipulate though,btohqsg
Reviews on sgcm also but again  reviews are always easy to manipulate,btohqsg
Some bad 1 is because of customer issue   some good 1 are fakes,btohqsg
Then  gentlemen  we have not yet found a feasible  practical and trustworthy rating mechanism. Work in progress,btohqsg
Rating mechanisms will never be completely trustworthy due to human input and emotional factors influencing them  however they can act as mere guides,btohqsg
I seen too many time barbaric customer demand for ridiculous request and did not get it   and give 1 star,btohqsg
you are in a good mood today!,btohqsg
Cause I slept on sofa yesterday,btohqsg
always nice to have a peaceful night without having to fight for the blanket.,btohqsg
That’s why recently as Singaporean we need to review this notion  “customer is always right” and “customer is King”. Customers these days are really out of hand,btohqsg
Hello. I’m driving an e200.Dashboard is showing that my tpms is not detected. The tpms is the original one. Can provide some advice?,btohqsg
Tyre sensor battery might be dead.,btohqsg
all four at the same time?  could also be battery as eric said and not sure if they are sealed units without possibility of battery replacements unlike some of the 3rd party ones.,btohqsg
Thanks guys. I googled based on ur reply and highly likely is the tpms battery!,btohqsg
That why working in service industry is really tough haha,btohqsg
