Which BTO don't have MGPS?Multi-Generation Priority Scheme (MGPS)Parents and their married child can make a joint application for 2 flats in a BTO project where 2-room Flexi or 3-room flats are integrated in the flat mix.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes,btohqsg
I see! okies thank you for this! üôÇ,btohqsg
So far I don‚Äôt see every BTO exercise offers this option.,btohqsg
Where did you read the BTO project don't offer MGPS?,btohqsg
I am not sure if I understand you correctly. But it will appear as an option in the application should it be allowed. That‚Äôs what I saw from the last last application,btohqsg
ic  and the BTO now don't have the option  is that what you mean.,btohqsg
"yep looks like the interface changed slightly this year. select your flat type first  then when you click ""next"" you'll be prompted to select MGPS or non-MGPS",btohqsg
Roger! Have u gone in to see,btohqsg
BTO project where 2-room Flexi or 3-room flats are integrated in the flat mix.,btohqsg
btw  technically got BTO that don't offer MGPS haha. like you said  if no 2R or 3R then won't have. the most recent example is hougang nov 2021 (hougang olive and tanjong tree residences),btohqsg
yep  played with the interface that's how i found out the change in hierarchy for the MGPS option,btohqsg
what  no. so far all the PLH's have MGPS.[edit]here we go  the appt date trackers for all PLH's launched so far  with the exception of aug 2022's as their selection hasn't started yet. but yep all have PLH!Nov 2021:River Peaks I & II (Central)Feb 2022:King George's Heights (Kallang/Whampoa)May 2022:Bukit Merah Ridge (Bukit Merah)May 2022:Ghim Moh Ascent (Queenstown),btohqsg
My mistake is the other one,btohqsg
i see. there's MCPS for PLH also  though? just that the quota is lower  that's all,btohqsg
hello  the HLE application is done during the flat selection stage right?,btohqsg
when is the EHG grant amount determined*?,btohqsg
Flat selection n nearer to key collection,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask  does this mean for Bukit Batok/Tengah  only 20% is for first timer couple?!,btohqsg
but below also say this  so I am quite confused,btohqsg
65% for couples without children  20% for first timer families with children i think,btohqsg
ohhh so it‚Äôll be assessed twice okay,btohqsg
can i just gauge right  for a couple with a combined gross salary of $8k/month  what is the max loan amount that HDB typically gives?,btohqsg
cause rn our gross salary is $5k/month  but we were only given $189k in max loan amount  is this normal or on the low side?,btohqsg
Previously in 2019 when my combined average was 5.5k  my granted amount was around 350k for BTO,btohqsg
Hi all  for this BTO exercise  if we want to apply for one of the Queenstown projects  understand we cannot choose the specific proj  but will be applying for all 3 based on flat type. This is not the norm right? Any idea how this will work in terms of balloting & flat selection?,btohqsg
Depends on your age and other loan etc.,btohqsg
Is there an application rate tracker for Sales of balance? The above seems to be for BtO only,btohqsg
"yes  that's why the post is titled ""BTO"" üòÖhttps://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Nov2022_SBF?strSystem=SBFfor SBF!you can also consider joining@sghdbsbffor the community discussing all things SBF (:",btohqsg
If you search this chat using the word 'lump'  it sounded like it's the norm to lump projects within the same estate together.,btohqsg
This is the norm. They don‚Äôt separate the locations as they‚Äôre all under Queenstown estate. ballot for Queenstown regardless which one you aiming for and don‚Äôt expect too much if you get bad queue number lor,btohqsg
i see! thanks for the clarification!,btohqsg
this is the norm. At Aug21  there were two plots of land at Hougang. One number  two plots.,btohqsg
if u get a not so good number  and want high floor  can consider choosing the not so popular plot out of the three. This was how i got a top floor unit last year at the less popular plot,btohqsg
Hi  can apply sbf and bto at the same time?,btohqsg
no you can only apply one,btohqsg
For 2rm flexi if getting 30yrs  price divide by 3?,btohqsg
when will I be able to apply for the PPHS housing scheme? during agreement signing?,btohqsg
Do I add my newborn as an occupier?,btohqsg
Hi why I don‚Äôt see BTO on river peak?,btohqsg
The Straits Times 24 Nov 2022- Over 9 600 BTO flats offered in mega HDB launch Part 2,btohqsg
Thank you. How do I send in application?,btohqsg
My mum‚Äôs age is now 62..if apply  need to buy how many years lease?,btohqsg
Not upon completion of the new unit ..,btohqsg
Please note if application return NRIC 5% will be gone if I am not wrong.,btohqsg
Anyone got the woodlands glade bto group?I only got into the MyRepublic groupbuy one.https://t .me/woodlandsglade,btohqsg
Hi i know when i fail for non mature bto i get one more ballot chance for the subsequent application but lets say I‚Äôve failed twice for non mature and now i apply mature for my subsequent application does my ballot chance go to 0 or still 2 more ballot chances,btohqsg
Hi can I ask what does point w meant by ‚Äúinclude those who have applied in earlier sales launches‚Äù?,btohqsg
20% of the total application  of this 20%  40% did not book a unit.If the rate is 1.7 you got a chance to book a unit.,btohqsg
Not true from personal and friends experiences. Got 1.28x but supply ran out  and they also see ethic quota,btohqsg
Hmm I believe the 40% is talking about for people who got a number to select flat  40% usually might drop out.I am confused about what does it meant by 20% of the application rates included previous round?,btohqsg
