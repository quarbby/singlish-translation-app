i had a bad rep in DHS,btohqsg
i was also very controversial in my batch1. They didnt like the fact that I didnt have to study as much but still did better than most of them2. They didnt like the fact that I spent so much time hanging out with different friend groups3. Especially in J2  they didnt like the fact that I was close to alot of J1s,btohqsg

i feel bad for any chers that have to deal with these kinds of classes,btohqsg
okay la actually my 3 classes were okay,btohqsg
but imo ur batch had a lot more drama than mine,btohqsg
One was rowdy chs guys + nice peopleOne was just confusing to deal withOne was an arts class that didnt feel like an arts class,btohqsg
or maybe it seems that way bc my batch lacked drama so much that they picked off on our seniors (aka ur batch) so we hear ab ur batchâ€™s drama the most,btohqsg
what drama is there even in my batch,btohqsg
ngl my class was just isolated from the rest of ej we just did our own shit,btohqsg
