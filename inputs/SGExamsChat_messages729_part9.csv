pervert senior?while i’m on reddit  i might as well ask for some advice about senior junior relationship. long story short  there’s this playboy senior who has apparently set his eyes on me. info is kind of unstable as it comes from another jc1  however they’ve been in the same sch previously so it’s not really that untrustworthy. the senior is the nicest to me out of all the other seniors  who apparently dislike me due to (reason i can’t say cos it may dox me). however the reason is also kind of unreasonable  but cos my schl is very toxic  i can’t do shit abt it. but now he’s the only nice senior i hv  if i make enemies with him it might bring my downfall in cca. our cca needs to be quite closely bonded also  to work better and have more teamwork. but the stuff i heard abt this senior is that he is only nice for a reason. i don’t have the best figure  but my frnd say that he has been involved in some things bfr. so the way he’s nice to me is only cos he wants smthng. we went out three times alrdy  as friends of course  but it’s weird also cos we just met 2 weeks ago. i normally make frnds easily  and although some of them have motives  none of them are ever as difficult as this one. i can satisfy pple’s motives if they’re reasonable  but for this senior i cant and wont give him what he wants  hence im quite troubled. the senior himself also admitted that he was a playboy  he so called changed though. so now im weighing my survival in school (senior is popular too) against my dignity and self esteem.,btohqsg
