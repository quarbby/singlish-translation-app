Retake the old one  might be better. Not many competition from current JC students,btohqsg
Old one has less time (15mins less per paper)  seems to be more Singapore oriented compared to new syllabus. Some other differences I recall-old one includes first and second degree price discrimination while new one only has 3rd degree-new one has cognitive bias while old one doesn’t have,btohqsg
Yeah  old one maybe only MI year 3 would be taking this year (but I might be wrong as I’m not from there so not very sure),btohqsg
