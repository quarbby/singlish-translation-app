Something to ponder over weekend.I separated the area analysis to 3 separate regionGreen: when it comes alive and spike to high of 11 cent or so in 2017Yellow: the sideways movement of 3 years after thatBlue: recent 1 year or so when it came alive,btohqsg
Some observation: green + yellow is 150 weeks. traded 817mblue zone lasted 42 weeks traded 872m.The stock took less than 40 weeks (9-10 months) to trade what previously took 150 weeks or 3 years approx,btohqsg
On a corporate front  few months back they are in talks to acquire selangor industrial properties from the controlling shareholder by offsetting receivables owed to amplefieldThe receivables amount was approximately 15m and the purchase is around half of that. The deal was not completed but an undertaking was done on 30/9/20 which is last day of their financial year.In the latest financial result the properties are already accounted for in their books due to the undertaking. The official transfer of ownership will take some time hence the rights have been transferred in private. Amplefield is already collecting rental since then.The balance $7.5m (approx. figures out of memory) will be due in feb 2021 and this is a potential catalyst on what could be done to settle this repayment by the controlling shareholder.In the previous EGM  shareholders have already given approval to the company to operate in Malaysia which was excluded previously due to potential conflict of interest with then chairman Dato Yap another bursa listed vehicle SHL Consolidated. However he has since stepped down in both and hence gotten approval since the potential conflict no longer exist.Nonetheless his home ground and area of expertise is in Malaysia and the approval will likely be beneficial to the company by tapping on his network and expertise.His son is the current Executice Director of Amplefield.Will await further developments on the repayment of the balance receivables but I’m guessing the news will likely coincide with the stock coming alive.Stay tuned for further updates,btohqsg
