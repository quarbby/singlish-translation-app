it was on the news I think,btohqsg
Yeah I remember after the paper lost issue it was raise in parliamentary questions,btohqsg
when i was s4  I remember having discussion with a friend on whether papers are flown to Cambridge  or Cambridge markers flown to SG,btohqsg
and we were wondering if flown to Cambridge  what happens if the plane crash,btohqsg
Used to be flown to Cambridge I think? Well not Cambridge Assessments,btohqsg
paper lost in train? think i heard of it but cant rmb wat happened,btohqsg
Cuz I remembered my Cher being damn anal about using friction pens,btohqsg
that marker left his briefcase in the train with all the scripts,btohqsg
I think even now friction pens just don't use cuz scanning and light might affect the inks chemistry and make it fade too,btohqsg
what happened to those students then?,btohqsg
cant imagine the horror of realization,btohqsg
I think they retake the papers,btohqsg
There was a December special session for them,btohqsg
Got a lot of noise about the stress of those students etc,btohqsg
But at the end of the day SEAB wins,btohqsg
they either retake or have a score that's based on sch prelims and similar standard sch candidates' O lvl score,btohqsg
they use the prelim grades to compute,btohqsg
the one i was referring to was A levels 2018,btohqsg
theres smt called saving contacts mah,btohqsg
i think 4 schools were affected (i only know SA  i cant remember which others),btohqsg
Usually moderation I can tell u SEAB very conservative one,btohqsg
It's honestly better to just retake if offered,btohqsg
oh think psle was liddat oso  if u cldnt attend(probly cus of covid) wld moderate based on the student above and below u in prelim and base on that or smth,btohqsg
Cuz the retaking size would be smaller and they can moderate much better,btohqsg
it just means prelims cannot play play,btohqsg
yes i know  but tbh it will do me good if it was a theory moderation off my prelims lol coz im pretty sure my prelims theory was better than my As,btohqsg
And also the difficulty won't be set to crazy levels like prelims,btohqsg
it was my prelims practical that gg,btohqsg
moderate based on their olvl score,btohqsg
but i think the 2018 incident was h2 chem p3 iirc,btohqsg
if ur prelim flying colors cant u just ck o lvl lol,btohqsg
but then ure gambling on if liddis ^ they oso do well,btohqsg
Honestly I will take the retake,btohqsg
As a person who has done SC twice it's not worth it,btohqsg
i didnt keep track of this  but the year before  some h2 chem p3 A level scripts were lost in the train iirc,btohqsg
if A1 then don't need bother retake,btohqsg
Dun think the grades are even shared..,btohqsg
The candidates dk their grades for the other papers,btohqsg
i think u need to decide first??? they not so stupid,btohqsg
Because of that incident  the setting of prelims also become … more important for the school to not anyhow make it incredibly difficult for the sake of it,btohqsg
Special consideration just removes that paper from consideration and moderate according to your other papers,btohqsg
some school (i should not name) deliberately set easy paper,btohqsg
I don’t think those schools do it in anticipation of their school’s scripts getting lost la,btohqsg
that one for a different reasons,btohqsg
cant say if thats lucky or unlucky lol,btohqsg
Following this procedure  about 91% (29 Candidates) of the affected candidates obtained at least a Pass grade  with about 63% (20 candidates) attaining distinctions  i.e. A1/A2. Almost all the affected candidates had been awarded better or the same grades for the O-Level Additional Mathematics as compared to their school preliminary examinations.,btohqsg
i say too much it will just make it more obvious which jc it is,btohqsg
and just nice 20 candidates from Nan Hua,btohqsg
I think my understanding is they were offered special consideration on top of their option to retake if they want,btohqsg
but maybe it is already very well known,btohqsg
