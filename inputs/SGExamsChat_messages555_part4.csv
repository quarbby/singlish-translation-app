after i say u got skill issue,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-ZBSGJR6UUImagine shutting down a whole govt..that is some next level clowning by the US,btohqsg
would be a travesty for anyone that doesn’t pass,btohqsg

This is the annual negotiating tactic by them,btohqsg
Nth to see  they will wait until last minute and sign,btohqsg
First time it happened was like 2011 or something,btohqsg
Since then it’s like an annual event for their congress and senate to wayang,btohqsg
in its history  only happened 3 times...and so far its all been within one decade,btohqsg
No la never fully shut down before  the debt ceiling they may furlough staff etc  but they always end up signing before defaulting,btohqsg
It’s just a game to them lol,btohqsg
rip the federal employees loosing jobs,btohqsg
I think backpaid once they sign off,btohqsg
If they default you can’t undo it  cause everyone won’t trust them any more,btohqsg
So they will play until almost default,btohqsg
“Shut down” is just them telling people go on no pay leave but in the end also backpaid and all return to normal,btohqsg
Is just a matter of choosing who to print money for,btohqsg
The Us Debt went up 10 Trillion from2017-2022to 30 trillion in 5 years..now in just the last year it went up by 3 trillion to 33 Trillion,btohqsg
i honestly feel like they are going to start printing banana money at some point,btohqsg
Because of inflation and because of the money they do print - it’s not actually necessarily a bad thing. That money just represents the potential of their country to produce wealth equivalent to that money. If they for example: really printed double the amount other countries refused to print  the value would of  course fall by half. But other countries are not stupid  they will print at the same rate to keep things in balance.,btohqsg
The real things countries do apart from print money  like make carbines  or computers or cars or whatever - that’s the real value of the money yet to be realized,btohqsg
So yeah  the money itself can be overprinted  but the US genuinely does produce a lot of stuff other people want and like  and they can keep doing that because of some really big reasons like the biggest military to help their friends  so the friends are ok if their government spends/prints a lot of money - it helps them somewhat sometimes.,btohqsg
But of course there’s a limit  but no one important doesn’t trust the USD yet,btohqsg
buying into SSB now is like putting your money under your pillow now,btohqsg
u won't know the interest 10 years later,btohqsg
plus also won't know if the market is going into recession or not,btohqsg
so SSB is a good place to park spare cash for emergency use,btohqsg
anyway each Singaporean only max 200k,btohqsg
yeah jus saw it  3% for 1 year so i guess its pretty good,btohqsg
getting 3.8 on my ocbc so no reason to buy ssb hehe,btohqsg
the deal may not last 10 years. Subject to changes,btohqsg
though I think interest and mortgage rates should stay at current levels for the health of the economyLow interest rates came in because of the crisis in2008/2009  and stayed there for way too long,btohqsg
if only my nsf pay can meet requirement also haha,btohqsg
put into another bank account. Paynow to yourself as salary,btohqsg
After that just apply from Internet banking,btohqsg
I have been applying for it on a monthly basis last 3 months,btohqsg
but its super liquid! i can take and use anytime and not worry abt it not being safe or cannot take when i rly need to,btohqsg
SSBs are just as safer but slightly less liquid,btohqsg
but honestly for most people in this grp  the age probably don't need that much emergency funds yet,btohqsg
just troublesome imo to deposit and withdraw.. but with our net worth idt that few decimal place % matters even if its slightly better in normal interest rate env hahahaha,btohqsg
why you suddenly disappear frm discord,btohqsg
you know IB tested coinchange for prelims practical,btohqsg
