if they have nothing better to do go study pls,btohqsg
later cannot get 90 then kpkb,btohqsg
what the its like 2 bus stops away though,btohqsg
Yes...but she deleted her account  which means she can't delete the messages,btohqsg
It‚Äôs been available for quite a while now,btohqsg
Which is why you should always screenshot messages you want to save,btohqsg
U are wayching everything except what i recommended,btohqsg
U put Lucifer on my list,btohqsg
No I meant like I was talking abt how dumb they were to not delete them first,btohqsg
its one of the more NSFW ones,btohqsg
There‚Äôs no outright sex scene or anything,btohqsg
wtf so I've been talking to multiple versions of Bernice,btohqsg
Not until Eve comes in  then there'll be orgies,btohqsg
Oh ya thanks for reminding me,btohqsg
time to learn hw to make meth in lab!,btohqsg
honestly i forgot my A level shit alr,btohqsg
I'm not even bloody kidding frm Nov 2019 I've talked to two similar girls but their names are both Amanda and Bernice???,btohqsg
I wonder if there are any chemistry experts here able to help,btohqsg
Took me 0.2 micro second more to think,btohqsg

Which is like how he has two identities,btohqsg
Ok i'm gonna take a sip of my dihydrogen monoxide,btohqsg
It‚Äôs no secret that Walter white proceeds to sell meth,btohqsg

I mean they didn‚Äôt tell you?,btohqsg

Aite imma be srs before i start banning ppl,btohqsg
But you‚Äôre still getting pop out parade right,btohqsg
For u to find out for me to know,btohqsg
Our POP got cancelled so we‚Äôre not shaving again !,btohqsg
it's been so long since I legitly chatted in here,btohqsg
But I do wish I got to go through the thing,btohqsg
do yall shave no.1 or no.0,btohqsg
Come by more we need the traffic,btohqsg
if there's still covid they said we'll pop in our unit LOL,btohqsg
How do you have so many free drinks,btohqsg
Free? When were they ever completely free?,btohqsg
AFTC was planning to do that for us,btohqsg
But then the BMT cancel thing happened,btohqsg
Now we‚Äôre home and still recruits,btohqsg
What do yall think of the reusable mask,btohqsg
And you are Netflixing your life away,btohqsg
Now that everyone is forced to mask up,btohqsg
Any mask can do tbat technically,btohqsg
but it allows viruses to enter tho,btohqsg
Is that good or bad in your opinion?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs meant for viruses to enter,btohqsg
But if no one lets any virus out  then there‚Äôs no virus to enter your mask,btohqsg
when i use the mask it makes my glasses foggy,btohqsg
Well there‚Äôs a video about that saying that masks don‚Äôt keep the viruses from entering  they just keep it from spreading from infected,btohqsg
Be a good sheepie and stay home,btohqsg
Try to adhere the mask better to your nose,btohqsg
And I did some mod work,btohqsg
But i didnt know about herd immunity,btohqsg
i did but still got gaps at cheek area,btohqsg
Shave no 1 one day before,btohqsg
Shave 0 a few days before,btohqsg
I thought is some govt thing,btohqsg
Shave 1  sometimes it's not short enough,btohqsg
Oh I thought you were asking ironically lol,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt know what HBL was,btohqsg
@flipthebucketshaved no 1 and they reshaved him,btohqsg
It‚Äôs all the rage with the kids these days,btohqsg
It was all over the news bro,btohqsg

When you fuck up a No 0,btohqsg
Once you ORD you will mind,btohqsg
I just shaved a few days before to get used to it,btohqsg
Cause I was damn nervous about bmt,btohqsg
Shaving helped me to get uses to the hair,btohqsg
Uk netflix has a look back feature,btohqsg
Navy doesn't care as much about hair,btohqsg
Ok what am I doing now,btohqsg
do ppl look cuter aft they shave their heads,btohqsg
Actually I dunno what kind of tv it is,btohqsg
Depends on your head shape I guess,btohqsg
I look even retarded than before,btohqsg
At least thats what my email tells me,btohqsg
Surprisingly  more guys with hair are cuter than without,btohqsg
I realised my head was small and my forehead was short after shaving,btohqsg
My extra height came from my long hair,btohqsg
When u squeeze your head out of the birth canal it affects the shape,btohqsg
I mean in NS no one really cares,btohqsg
I didn't take any picture of myself with the botak head,btohqsg
You do know that the skull only becomes fixed at ~4 months right,btohqsg
Oh I didn't get a csection so the top of my head's flat,btohqsg
So I can't remember how I look like,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just short for a while and it grows back,btohqsg
Do take note of the word used,btohqsg
At least not thrown against a wall,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok because babies are soft and bouncy,btohqsg
Now you knowSo the shape of your skull  blame your parents,btohqsg
No ah its the shape of the y^2 graph,btohqsg
I always use them as ping pong balls,btohqsg
wait is xenon ur actl name or the character from maplestory,btohqsg
I don't think it works that way,btohqsg
He was born in a chemist family,btohqsg
Xenon and your first thought is a character from maple,btohqsg
isnt it a character from maplestory?no?,btohqsg
He was born in a maple story family,btohqsg
Maplestory Xenon has a pretty cool backstory,btohqsg
Most people would think of the element xenon,btohqsg
Yeah the abilities are cool asf too,btohqsg
I'm helium because helium atoms exist alone,btohqsg
i too smol brain to think of tht,btohqsg
I can be with you uwu,btohqsg

Arent u underage for magic juice under my interpretation of what that juice stands for,btohqsg
Ehhhhh grape stuff like grape mogumogu is good,btohqsg
The grape juice in the pokka vending machine really isn't that great though,btohqsg
Qoo and mogumogu MUST be exceptions,btohqsg
It tastes a bit idk scratchy,btohqsg
And wine usually is pretty meh,btohqsg
I didn't know how to express what I dislike about it,btohqsg
It makes you feel like your throat is dry but only when u drink it,btohqsg
Agreed. The cheap ones are especially bad,btohqsg
It's OK to be wrong  after all,btohqsg
A good rule of thumb foralcohol:,btohqsg
The more likely its trying to compensate,btohqsg
If you pay me a delivery fee I can get them from inside camp for you,btohqsg
The bottled kyojo one or smth,btohqsg
Ehhh I could empty the whole vending machine,btohqsg
Bottled drinks in general don‚Äôt taste very nice,btohqsg
I dont remember the brand of the jelly drink but i can remember all grapr jelly drinks taste the same and are not too bad,btohqsg

And why would Rachel attack herself,btohqsg
