Yes and no...the mining network (and dependent costs like equipment and electricity) are what gives bitcoin some kind of price reference for valuation only when it is initially minted  but that is not what gives bitcoin its value after that,btohqsg
Survival skills is the core haha,btohqsg
"The keywords are ""securing the network"". Not sure about the future but nobody can create a ""fake"" BTC or double spend at the moment.",btohqsg
But if u follow that rule strictly. Very hard to get rich since u will only be in very conservative investments. Or invest very little.,btohqsg
Very many have tried to create alternate coins (with varied success). So the question I'm trying to drive at is why is bitcoin valued so much differently from the others? Surely the mining equipment  electricity  features etc. is not vastly different from some other currencies (and actually in some aspects it is even worse than some of the other currencies out there).Therefore my conclusion is that there must be a significant amount of non-tangibles (mindshare  expectations  etc.) that is giving bitcoin value.,btohqsg
i have seen alot of ppl burn before  consistently maintain holding power will build wealth steady. Not as if u want to be warran buffet next. I am contend with what i can build. U can land in trouble if u overestimate your cash flow and over leverage.,btohqsg
Anyway u suppose to invest extra and not the core asset u hold  of course it really differ depending on your age group,btohqsg
Hello everyone  does anyone know if you can earn 4mpd on public transport using amaze + citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Read the T&C and you too will know üòâhttps://www.citibank.com.sg/pdf/0124/rewards-card-2024-tnc.pdf,btohqsg
Ok I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs relevant but my personal experience is to whack all in when I was young. Into risky assets. Then as I got older I rotated the risky assets into conservative ones.I must say that the risky assets I was in when young. Would have affected my lifestyle for sure if they went bust.Even now. My more conservative assets if go bust will also affect my lifestyle. Just the chance of bust is much much lower than the risky assets.I would find it hard to put all my assets into only government related securities or bank deposits. Returns are far too low.,btohqsg
no  restricted   no flights   no travels no hotel,btohqsg
so okay  youdodo not earn 4mpd because Bus/ MRT MCC is 4111  which is in the excluded travel merchant categories of Citi rewards card?,btohqsg
oh crap. okay. thank you for letting me know ü•≤,btohqsg
"5. (x) clearly excludes ""transit-related transactions"" ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",btohqsg
A thought is before we take up any promotions on saving accounts  credit cards  sign up deals  FD promotion  etc  read the T&C thoroughly to make sure we can fulfill the criteria with minimum changes to our spending habits and hassles and thus able to reap the most benefits from it. These are sources to build up our passive income and hence it is not productive to spend too much effort on this.,btohqsg
BlackRock is 0.38% charge and 15% withholding taxAnundi prime usa fund is 0.35% charge and 30 withholding tax.So BlackRock is better ? For now BlackRock s&p 500 not available in cpf but available for srs>endowus investment.Noted,btohqsg
I think you're muddling together two different issues:1. Which type of fund to buy (i.e. which index do you want to track)? Blackrock S&P 500 and Amundi prime USA track different indices  so it's like comparing apples to oranges.2. Are you buying US-domiciled or Ireland-domiciled? Ireland-domiciled will enjoy lower dividend witholding tax but will usually be subject to higher management fees. Need to plug in your projected numbers to make a decision as to which is better.,btohqsg
all this are excluded spending that will not be eligible for the uob's bonus interest,btohqsg
Chris literally compared  this two options in his video and BlackRock is recommended for srs. (For the layman they are similar and mostly cover the s&p500)S&P 500 at absolute lowest cost would be BlackRock option I guess,btohqsg
Can I clarify  you're asking for someone to explain further the detailed reasoning behind why Chris recommended the blackrock option for SRS?,btohqsg
Hi  i wanted to buy eurail (which charges euro) with the DBS women world card. Will this be counted as local transaction  4mpd or as FCY spending  1.2 mpd?,btohqsg
if i pair citi premier miles with amaze. does that count as local or FCY spending?,btohqsg
got it  thank u very much,btohqsg
Hi peeps  anyone did this promo? Seems good deal,btohqsg
Answer why Blackrock for Cash/SRS  Amundi for CPF are found in the article link.https://endowus.com/insights/sp500-index-funds-us-stocks,btohqsg
this is what happens when people abuse the system ‚òπÔ∏è,btohqsg
I am sorry. I should have done some calculations myself. Chris video is quite self explanatory,btohqsg
So how. What other cards can get anything out of snack payments ?I understand Maybank visa platinum can get cashback,btohqsg
Both my uob Amex and cb Amex cannot top up Sian,btohqsg
Bobian alr  need use normal credit card to purchase snack alr. Provided their challenges still provide good rewards,btohqsg
Can someone explain how to milk 150k miles from snack? I thought the benefits are from cashback?,btohqsg
You only have until 13 march if you want toMilk something,btohqsg
Yea can explain how to milk miles? The rates are so low,btohqsg
Top up and get miles. Repeat,btohqsg
Why would u top up using a miles card when cashback card is better?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know. Don‚Äôt know how to use miles. I only followed gurus here that recommended the Uob Amex card which is now nerfed,btohqsg
It was on limited time once the news was spread  not surprised. Always enjoy it while it is available,btohqsg
I heard there is a cap they set on a per snack account basis.,btohqsg
I‚Äôve just been told that my daily transportation does not qualify under the One Bonus category. Any tricks to share how all your spending is valid for One Bonus crediting?,btohqsg
If your daily transport is simply go it definitely qualifies for 10% cash back up to $1500 per month,btohqsg
It is under Simply go but bank said I spend less than $500 last month coz public transport is not counted.,btohqsg
Did u monitor your uob one account tracker ?,btohqsg
