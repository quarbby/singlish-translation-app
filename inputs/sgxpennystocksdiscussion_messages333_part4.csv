fair?800m market cap on back of 10m net profitsmt 130m net profits less than 600mjt 30m net profits less than 200m,btohqsg
"but this kind pump dump ""yakult"" effectwhere is sgx?where is mas?chasing shadows of telegram group promoters while the real criminals no where to be found",btohqsg
So all not fair la didn‚Äôt?,btohqsg
use JT and MT for example only laoceanus had a 2b+ market capitalisation at its recent peakbasically stronger than oxley and etc property firms ü§£ü§£but last year a lot of writedowns so not so good to use property firms as examplebut did warn in forward projections for oceanus (asked must sell how much to be worth 2b+ earlier on)just to clarify.no i am not zane i no short one,btohqsg
Past profit may or may not recur in the future... if really want to compute fair value then simply use the net assets divide by outstanding shares as the market price which will never happen due to market sentiments... this is why there is opportunity to gain,btohqsg
Especially true for penny stocks as the market cap is smaller and easier to goreng,btohqsg
It seem a lot of seniors here are good at identifying the ‚Äúwaves‚Äù and ride on them. This is really based on technical analysis and not fundamental. Such waves although may be large but mostly do not last long.... so best do own due diligence and think before placing your chips....,btohqsg
Myself is more on fundamental and my own view is Oceanus fundamental is weak and the recent price hike are goreng effect...,btohqsg
US market pre market green green,btohqsg
The Edge Singapore | Hong Lai Huat subsidiary receives in-principal approval to develop agriculture eco city in Cambodiahttps://www.theedgesingapore.com/news/property/hong-lai-huat-subsidiary-receives-principal-approval-develop-agriculture-eco-city,btohqsg
https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/mothership.sg/2020/09/hong-lai-huat//ampNews dated Sept 2020. Currently their rights to convert $0.091 is trading.Timely news on the eco city prospects. However  the 3030 updates on collaboration with SKold on the agribusiness deal is one to look out for.Last time round after the announced  Hong Lai Huat opened $0.123 and ran to $0.22 before closing $0.20.They mentioned that they would need 6 months to finalise and it is almost time for a further update ?,btohqsg
"High risk investment. 100+ km frm Phnom Penh / Sihanoukville. it's not ""on the way"" when you travel between the two cities.",btohqsg
Last time round push to $0.22 as highlighted was strong but no real selling to bring it to current price level which is close to the rights price. I recall seeing insiders buying at $0.12 range couple months back too. This Hong LAI HUAT really seems to be getting more interesting. But now depends on market sentiments. I reckon the next big market play after medicals would be on agriculture./ food related üôèüèª let‚Äôs see.,btohqsg
Anyone got in Hong Lai Huat. This one in my watchlist and saw some buyers come in after a long time. Current price close to rights issues price $0.091. I think got chance they play. Vested a little only for now.,btohqsg
^ why can't HLH pick a better location along highway 4.,btohqsg
Not to Aoral but from the map... think the location can do better if HLH was aiming for something inbetween PP and SHV.,btohqsg
I reckon this update which might come would be a much stronger catalyst than eco city. This one looks legit and 6 months already. Last time they announced  ran up almost 100% in the day. There‚Äôs danish ambassador too. Legit deal in the making.,btohqsg
For me the big play will be this for Hong Lai Huat. Also price now quite safe. Looks bottomed. Invested small for now. Will see how the PA before deciding next move,btohqsg
Yea that‚Äôs why I load small only lady 2 days since illiquid but today got some buyers come. Wonder who. Tomorrow I think got chance they play this one,btohqsg
The first time round I missed the play after the MOU deal with SKold. Watch it run $0.123 to $0.22 . Crazy.But i think not many retailers got on then.,btohqsg
HGH also another one  now stuck for a bit. Quite surprised they force the break out and then let it die. Can hold I think no problem. I believe they flush . Big flush since sentiments not good  they rest first. I know HGH BBs loaded a lot already.,btohqsg
hope the best for all heng ong huat?,btohqsg
Anyone on the Aztech Global  IPO @1.28 which is closing tomorrow?,btohqsg
