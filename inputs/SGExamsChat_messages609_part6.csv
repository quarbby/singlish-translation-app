yeah the jump from sec 4 to sec 5 is big,btohqsg
since ik sec 5 is gonna be hell i might as well just study o level syllabus for all subjects in sec 4,btohqsg
the difference in performance of na and exp students is pretty big for some subjects at o level,btohqsg
there’s a lot i can do with more than 1 year to o lvls,btohqsg
Pls as a MI student and a millennium  we do not acknowledge him,btohqsg
I can assure u not even my snrs know of that joker,btohqsg
this caleb soh dude was a rando then started to become a meme in the sgexams discord server when he kept talking about how good MI is,btohqsg
Has anyone considered Millenia Institute instead of polytechnic? It charges $6/mth school fees as compared to thousands/year and has a higher percentage of students qualifying for local university.,btohqsg
Our sch reputation alr not that much as in not too good   not too bad  but he decide to just yeet it down the drain,btohqsg
Ngl I think MI is a good school  A levels is quite demanding and 1 extra year can be helpful to some,btohqsg
But caleb soh dk what he waffling about,btohqsg
He say he want to do IB,btohqsg
If someone gave me a Lambo  I would not have business skills  I would have a Lambo. I therefore do not think that Lambos imply you have business skills. I like that MI gives me more time to think about proofs.,btohqsg
Also apparently he has an undergrad degree and wants MI,btohqsg
Hello SGExams  I am a degree graduate with distinction in bachelor physics looking to retake the A level math subject as a private candidate (previously scored a B without AMaths background). I solve questions for free onask.manytutors.comand am keen in offering free Zoom lessons or free recordings on YouTube. Let me know what topics you are interested in and feel free to ask your friends if they are interested in helping me study the subject.,btohqsg
yk what was the funny thing,btohqsg
Idk if he had beef with MI before,btohqsg
si yan researched on this dude’s thesis,btohqsg
Someone say caleb soh is a legit tutor but the discord acc is made by someone who want to troll him,btohqsg
i feel like this guy is ambitious and i respect him for that,btohqsg
but then what’s with making MI better than JC,btohqsg
idt anybody would spend so much effort,btohqsg
yeah that’s one way to get attention,btohqsg
Someone said its a student of caleb soh  who isnt doing well in amaths and caleb soh stated MI as a viable option to consider after O levels so student felt insulted and made discord acc to troll caleb soh,btohqsg
if it’s actually true somebody is tryna impersonate him and ruin his rep,btohqsg
then I sorta feel bad for the guy,btohqsg
Now that I think abt it,btohqsg
After careful consideration  I have decided to transfer out of DHS to go to MI,btohqsg
Oh chey he wasn't MI alumni,btohqsg
U mean they dun let u go sec5?,btohqsg
Coz i rmb my sch also did that for pfp students,btohqsg
Like they only can attend class until pfp results are out,btohqsg
mine don’t even let me attend class,btohqsg
Yes  I graduated from NTU with distinction in basic physics. I then studied A Maths at a tuition center  and am now studying A level maths (I got a B in H2 maths on my first attempt without A Maths). It is my life ambition to go to MI one day.,btohqsg
are u...gonna take Os as a priv candidate,btohqsg
nah I’m gonna go pfp if I accepted,btohqsg
@cedricmxraisdo you want to go to MI,btohqsg
i hope that the sch will actually allow me to go sec 5 even if i qualify for pfp since i wanna go jc,btohqsg
Isit they dw let ppl go sch 5 due to high failure rates?,btohqsg
Idk but im from sec 5,btohqsg
do you have to apply for pfp,btohqsg
Lol hey no heart feelings   u do u,btohqsg
or is it auto apply if ur grades good enough,btohqsg
no it’s because sec 5 is basically a death wish,btohqsg
I mean its really how much u wanna put in ur effort ah,btohqsg
I went from prelim 38 to raw 13,btohqsg
true but then cramming o lvls syllabus in less than a year is basically cancer,btohqsg
usually exp students i think they start o lvl syllabus from sec 3 onwards so they still got time,btohqsg
Maybe now syllabus different but its 20-30% increase,btohqsg
that’s why I’m studying o lvls syllabus now,btohqsg
