the best meets are fri nights at ecp,btohqsg
itâ€™s peaceful and with proper petrolheads,btohqsg
the reason why i chose the place is cos its private uh  but since theyre kind of against open meets then i might jst make it private,btohqsg
Car meet nowadays all just SHOW OFF YOUR CAR,btohqsg
if u wanna put urself out there to be accountable for people who disobey u idt thatâ€™s very wise,btohqsg

Then thatâ€™s too bad for the host or whether or not he cares?,btohqsg
The ones who wld mainly talk abt car are the ones who owns a car,btohqsg
less people would comemore petrolheads would show up,btohqsg
If spotters come i doubt they wld wanna sit n talk all tgt yk,btohqsg

Dun be such a pessimist ler...,btohqsg
