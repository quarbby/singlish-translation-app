how uob know u using coupon? and where in the TnC states this? sounds like uob is bullshitting u,btohqsg
I think cso is bullshitting  i use to use all cat coupon and uob one to pay  cashback is fine,btohqsg
I get the max coz i hit 2k either on shopee or dfi,btohqsg
Yes i know  i have been using uob one for more then 15 year liao,btohqsg
Yes she hits max additional cashback with 2k spend on either Shopee or DFI. What's the amounts for each individual transaction?,btohqsg
I rmb if u hit 500/1000 tier the additional cashback is not 6.77  it is only 5. Only 2k tier is 6.67  did u taken into account of that when u do your calculation,btohqsg
looks close to full bonus 5% assuming u spend $500 each month,btohqsg
ESPP is taxable when we sell? Thought no capital gains tax anyway,btohqsg
No capital gains tax  but the discounted price is taxableThe one I‚Äôm not clear about is does my contribution to buy ESPP taxable. Logically it is.Which for me if I get a discount buy of 15% and company is not paying the 17% of what I investedWhen buying100$ 15% discount = 85$ (I save 15$)85$ company not paying 17% (company save 14.45)Still trying to think if there is any good for me to buy in into this.,btohqsg
I find it no point to pinpoint to the last dollar. Depends on how you value this benefit. Some see it as a form of forced savings set aside. Besides  your 15% discount today  may go up further when the co share price goes up  and you‚Äôll reap the profit too. In addition  you still get dividends along the way too.,btohqsg
for snack  how long do i need to hold the policy for to receive the dividend?,btohqsg
Alipay can be use in sg or only cn?,btohqsg
So for the 3 months  how much was total spent on Shopee and DFI (i.e. Giant  etc)?Anyway UOB CSOs are infamous for being wrong a lot of time.,btohqsg
There is monthly dividend declare 3 working day before month end,btohqsg
Can try first. Then do 5%.,btohqsg
ohh so meaning as long as i hold the policy till the declared date i will get the dividend? i remember seeing there is a min holding period of 21 days (in total) right?,btohqsg
Cso might be smoking uI‚Äôve encountered cases where a Shopee purchase was wrongly classified as Shopee topup. Luckily I tracked all my 10% cash backs and I complained and emailed them a copy of the item purchase receipt. Uob had to adjust both base tier cashback and additional cashback.It was also very obvious because I got $100 base cashback instead of $200 as the Shopee purchase was excluded wrongly.,btohqsg
Hi Guys  for secured cc application  which Q type should i take? Counter or Account opening?,btohqsg
Is there a way to check ocbc 360 cc eligible spending as you go (similar to uob one tracker)?,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtso should I email them to complain? Which channel did you used to dispute the error?,btohqsg
Live chat. Who arranged for a callback by credit card specialist via phone 1-2 working days later.Just Make sure u are able to support your calculations with emailable evidence.,btohqsg
For OCBC 360  I see there is $2 fall below fee for 3k. They will really charge me if I take out all the money ?,btohqsg
Pls ignore my previous msg. All shopee spendings regardless of coupon usage should still get 5% additional cash back.I just realised all along I've mixed up my uob one card quarter with manhatten card. Lol. I did a live chat and the CSO was able to calculate the correct spending and told me my correct quarter so misunderstanding cleared. I really wonder why the previous CSO told me coupon usage may not earn additional cash back... Thanks for all your help@mttelegrammt@MelvynEziTrazora@qqplaces!,btohqsg
Haha i sort of figure out it is quarter issue coz uob one quarter is confusing,btohqsg
Told you the UOB CSO is mostly cock one..,btohqsg
I actually asked on phone to verify my quarter and recorded it in my xls sheet. Not that confusing if you know uob one savings interest is based on monthly while card cashback is based on quarter. My mistake is referring to the wrong row in my excel sheet (manhatten instead of uob one). üòÖ,btohqsg
Really? I found UOB cso to be far nicer and helpful than DBS ones. Got 1 DBS indian cso literally shouted at me coz i wanted to cancel my card due to fraudulent charges,btohqsg
Anyone knows which credit card application would get you the best attractive gifts?,btohqsg
That is what happen when job is outsource to overseas cheaper labour,btohqsg
Uob CSO are nice and courteous  but some might give you the wrong info. Lol,btohqsg
I just saw my amaze card had 3.6% spread on Thai baht. Google rate is 1sgd=27.28thb and amaze gave 26.33thb ü•≤. Standalone card could've been better üòÖ,btohqsg
Does weekend affect the spread in any ways?,btohqsg
should compare with Mastercard rate not google rate,btohqsg
Compare your credit card rate with amaze instead of google since you‚Äôre using your credit card instead of cash. And you haven‚Äôt take into account the rewards that you will get,btohqsg
Ok. Thanks for the guide. Mastercard rate shows that amaze spread is 2%. Not as bad as I thought.,btohqsg
Honestly this Q category is very confusing de. Like some things are in multiple category but they make you guess. Best is go to the branch and ask.,btohqsg
Nice doesn't mean competent. They can be helpful in giving wrong advice but it does not mean it is actually helping you.,btohqsg
I give up aldy  Bank says since i‚Äôm Myanmar foreigner and my work pass expires date is less than one year which is 10 months left   cannot open secured cc also ,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have two questions regarding HSBC May EGA bonus interest promoQ1: The June bonus interest will be calculated based on June ADB - April ADB right since April is the reference month.Q2: Clause 6 just means that the bonus interest will only be credited by 31st August 2024 for this round's bonus interest promo right? I can still empty the account and transfer to other banks for July (i.e. no need to hold any amount in HSBC EGA until the fulfillment date after 30th June).,btohqsg
With this card they deliver both Visa and American Express Cards. Or only one?,btohqsg
1. Yes. But 1% from everyday+ rewards is based on May 24  so it's not worth.2. Yes. Would be better to empty in Jun actually. For the same reason above.,btohqsg
Hahaha see.. 2 ppl have different answers ü§£ go branch check is best.,btohqsg
Account opening for the fd  but mine was done at counter and mum was directly to account opening,btohqsg
Yes. Weekend markup is usually worse due to amaze / master / visa building buffer in a closed fx market.,btohqsg
Amaze getting worse and worse liao  yesterday my spread for thb is 2.8-2.9%.,btohqsg
I would stick to your original thinking of comparing amaze rate with interbank spot rate.Because you need to fight with cash and YouTrip.Even though credit cards still earn u rewards u can still lose out to using cash or no rewards YouTrip.For example if u use a lousy cash back or miles card that only earns u for example 1% benefit. Should u be paying a 4% total fx markup (bank markup + Mastercard markup) or should u be paying with YouTrip or paying with cash.,btohqsg
Just stick to the basic building blocks principal of:Card issuer markup + master/visa/amex markupAnd it is always easy to compare with any other payment method.,btohqsg
