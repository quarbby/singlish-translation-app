Can rebound in paper 2 not to worry,btohqsg
If like that still got hope,btohqsg
No linear law or graph came out,btohqsg
🤡🤡 i memorise graph for nth,btohqsg
Imagine all the sketching linear law come out,btohqsg
Yea i thought simple interest lmao,btohqsg
But everything is easy to you...,btohqsg
One of my top 3 choices,btohqsg
Yall mfs better go study binomial too,btohqsg
A1 for amath is how much ah,btohqsg
wym bro linear law just ln then can alr,btohqsg
But I'm not sure. I've even heard 90,btohqsg
i minus 6-7 marks i think,btohqsg
oh fuck is it -1 if I didn’t say x^2 + 4 > 0,btohqsg
Yall alpha beta qn got put =0?,btohqsg
My tr say 75 then a1,btohqsg
My teacher say 79 for A2,btohqsg
Paper two is 90 total isit?,btohqsg
I think got some questions will be removed,btohqsg
So should have more time to do other question,btohqsg
I honestly think A1 should be around 88 plus minus 2,btohqsg
Yo for the x coordinates A and B  I leave in 1.83 and 1.31  acceptable rit?,btohqsg
Dude emath both pp hv clt,btohqsg
E math is usually like 92% and I can see the international paper grade threshold for e math and a math isn’t very different,btohqsg
Cuz they didn't ask for exact form,btohqsg
But may affect ur final ans,btohqsg
Maybe can but if you didn’t use exact for next part u wrong,btohqsg
Just now during exam I saw quite a number of ppl using ruler to draw smtg for one qn? Is it required?,btohqsg
If need use ruler im fucked,btohqsg
Is it extend line for the modulus graph?,btohqsg
Ruler most likely for the modulus or the shaded area to draw out the rectangle,btohqsg
Should be fine mah  not curve sketching or graph sketching related,btohqsg
Wah olvls make this chat lively but also boring,btohqsg
What to expect in this chat in the next few days,btohqsg
Sat and sun abt 200 msg each day,btohqsg
Monday till thursday 10000 msg total,btohqsg
Studying 10 chpt for 1 qn would be the death of me,btohqsg
So i left with am chem phys geo hist,btohqsg
I mean i get x as decimal...,btohqsg
Omg guys  if I wrote y' for 1st derivative and y'' for 2nd derivative  I won't be deducted right?,btohqsg
I think at most is presentation mark,btohqsg
Does anyone have a softcopy of 4047/1,btohqsg
I need a softcopy cause I am legitamately scared rn,btohqsg
I went into the classroom feeling ok,btohqsg
I legit need to get 75 and abv for my p2,btohqsg
Cuz p2 is out of 90 plus,btohqsg
I rmb similar qn came out in TYS tho,btohqsg
I never see any of those in tys,btohqsg
Or is it the bengali tiger,btohqsg
i think if ecf still have 5m lol,btohqsg
YA the kinematic is so tedious,btohqsg
i lost sm marks : )),btohqsg
Now time to study other subjects,btohqsg
do halfway the ans v weird...im like doubting myself,btohqsg
My teacher say compound interest for dat qn accepted,btohqsg
just curious but can moderation make the grade boundary lower than the standard ?? like is that possible,btohqsg
how do u explain for the m question,btohqsg
which one is case by case,btohqsg
parallel to the mod will give u only 1 pt,btohqsg
and if its greater than that it will still only touch 1 pt nia,btohqsg
then another case is it touched only min pt / just not even touching it at all,btohqsg
Ooo question 1.. this topic will be out of syllabus next year onwards,btohqsg
i guess this amath ppr is the toughest just to pave the way for the new syllabus lmfao,btohqsg
Why every year syllabus learn lesser and lesser,btohqsg
Yeah sum and product of roots,btohqsg
Plain geometry is the distinction filter subject,btohqsg
Since paper 1 dh  paper 2 marks is reduced rit?,btohqsg
Anyway even if you forget the formula you can just keep multiplying 1.07 in your calculator. So the original value times 1.07=Ans  then ansx1.07 and so on,btohqsg
Cant say for sure but i think there’s a very good chance at least 5 marks removed,btohqsg
Yeah.. y-intercept of y = mx -2 is -2.. draw a line from y = 2 to the vertex... that’s the minimum gradient which is 4/7,btohqsg
The line shifts with increasing gradient from 4/7 to 2 where it is parallel to the graph of y = |7-2x|,btohqsg
I thought part 2 is find gradient,btohqsg
I get positive graident i think,btohqsg
Negative 1 divided by your positive gradient,btohqsg
lost like 10 marks due to careless af mistakes,btohqsg
I lost the marks to alpha beta n compound interest,btohqsg
the fkn motorcyclist took away my marks,btohqsg
he drove away with my marks i guess,btohqsg
I hope the motorcyclist runs over smth,btohqsg
run over alr cannot get back the 6m also,btohqsg
The question need reject angle  if never reject 2 of them,btohqsg
huh? Thrs only 2 ans tho,btohqsg
Ya i know i found 4 wtf,btohqsg
not no mark prolly. -1 oni,btohqsg
i wrote -1 < sin A < 1,btohqsg
I arrowed to 2 n reject,btohqsg
Huh I only got 2 answers 199.5 and 340.5,btohqsg
just one mark bro don’t fret,btohqsg
Max only Minus one so u can still get ur other marks,btohqsg
i rlly hope for that 70/80,btohqsg
alot of good people are taking amath,btohqsg
so ur basically competing with the strong as fuk students out there,btohqsg
i heard 75/80 thrn a1  true or nah,btohqsg
Centre at (-2 3)  so radius from centre to (1 7) has positive gradient. The tangent at (1 7) has negative gradient then,btohqsg
a should be 75-80 and above,btohqsg
80-90% for a1 depending on how everyone did,btohqsg
Tbh don’t stress about dat bro,btohqsg
but given the difficulty it shldnt be above 80,btohqsg
Ffs i damn scared abt the curve,btohqsg
its the toughest i’ve ever seen,btohqsg
its one of the hardest p2s they seen,btohqsg
I just done the same question,btohqsg
And realise got 2 extra answerr,btohqsg
So isit just minus one mark,btohqsg
How u even get 4 ah,btohqsg
Can take photo of ur working,btohqsg
No like even if sinA is 2,btohqsg
How tf u get 4 ans?,btohqsg
I will show u my solution,btohqsg
Actually they dun care one lol.,btohqsg
I just want know if i will get some mark or no,btohqsg
damn 1 week of Os done ready,btohqsg
I see if i gonna pass or no,btohqsg
If they deduct 1/2 mark or what,btohqsg
Relax yes you’ll get ur marks,btohqsg
Out  of 7 u prob getting 6,btohqsg
If it’s 2A  need to add more,btohqsg
I think you’ll lose 1 or 2 for writing extra answers that are wrong,btohqsg
He nvr write extra answers ah,btohqsg
Possible what range i get ah,btohqsg
hi does anyone know range for c5/b4 for amath,btohqsg
70/80 should be within reach for a1 anot ah,btohqsg
Aiya just do well lah. Really.,btohqsg
How was the a math paper,btohqsg
Really maybe go ite liao lmfao,btohqsg
screw amath just take h1 in jc,btohqsg
My a math friends all died lol,btohqsg
polytechnic skills are more relevant today,btohqsg
ya bro i think we can just aim for cp,btohqsg
but it was rlly rlly a jump in difficulty,btohqsg
i heard my friend didnt even go school for the paper 😂,btohqsg
and my ass got murdered by it shitless,btohqsg
i got q a few friends that did it,btohqsg
bc like they score damn jialat,btohqsg
and the prelims easier than this o lebel shit,btohqsg
idk whether he got go or not,btohqsg
Last year N level was ok actually.But same standard. But different way,btohqsg
What’s the difference between that an o level a maths?,btohqsg
No la. N level got H1 math.,btohqsg
got 4 sec 5 pple taking amath for o level,btohqsg
H1 math is basically just a math,btohqsg
fak la then ig just take ki,btohqsg
h1 math has so much stats,btohqsg
Fam you want to take that?,btohqsg
amath rlly said no to my hopes,btohqsg
i actually dont mind writing shit,btohqsg
i want vjc but the hope seems,btohqsg
Your competing against the most brilliant philosophers in the whole of Singapore,btohqsg
They remove a lot of thing,btohqsg
Most RI people don’t even dare to take K and I,btohqsg
h1 math dun have product rule and quoient rule,btohqsg
Because it’s dang difficult to score an A,btohqsg
take hsp and kpkb my way to nus la,btohqsg
I might take it if I somehow do dang well for o levels,btohqsg
But probably not because k and I requires your general knowledge to be immense,btohqsg
I’m surprised so many people here want to take k and I considering how rare it is,btohqsg
they fk up then they suddenly got btr grades than expected,btohqsg
vjc but that one can dream alr,btohqsg
but 2018 was more difficult tho,btohqsg
what can u expect fRom a 6 point l1r5 jc,btohqsg
if u say vjc lots of nerds that means raffles and hc more lor,btohqsg
i will go if the system good,btohqsg
A lot of Hwa Chong people have no social intelligence,btohqsg
I speak from first hand experience,btohqsg
my teacher was from hc hsp,btohqsg
it depends on who u meet la,btohqsg
Next time go popular and see,btohqsg
Each HC cohort has like 1.5k people,btohqsg
walk past i can tell alrdy xd,btohqsg
If u walk past HC  ur legs must be v strong to walk so long,btohqsg
I’ve stayed in the school for three days two night,btohqsg
no la not the whole bloody campus LOL,btohqsg
all the 2 pointers there leh,btohqsg
if im there im gonna be the 100th percentile,btohqsg
Guys i know its weird to ask now,btohqsg
For area under graph x coordinate,btohqsg
its ok to leave 3sf if they nvr ask for exact value,btohqsg
Question 7 if get 4 answer max u guys think how much can get,btohqsg
Just study for paper 2 la.,btohqsg
When’s the a math paper 2? ,btohqsg
hopefully P2 can at least 95%...,btohqsg
is p2 usu easier than p1 or smth,btohqsg
Part (a) can leave in 3sf but btr to put in exact,btohqsg
Naw usually if one paper is easy the other will be difficult,btohqsg
But part (b) need to be exact.,btohqsg
So y’all probably don’t have to be too scared,btohqsg
i think they wld balance the difficulty,btohqsg
Ye is paper 2 shouldn’t be that difficult,btohqsg
almost write in 3sf 😂 luckily i check,btohqsg
Are under graph one part a 3sf completely wrong uh like that,btohqsg
Hi. Do any J2s still have their rtq bank?,btohqsg
How much juice is too much,btohqsg
i’m damm late but i walk pass hc w high heels and gotta say my leg died it’s too bloody big i walk from the entrance to the other end,btohqsg
Now why would you do that,btohqsg
bc i was there for mun and we had to report at salt centre so :D,btohqsg
The students thr shld be quite fit,btohqsg
do hc students lool down on ppl from neighbourhood jcs?,btohqsg
They say yishun jc no good,btohqsg
no offence but thats what every other jcs say other than yijc,btohqsg
I mean  now it is 🤷‍♀️,btohqsg
After the merger it got a whole lot worse,btohqsg
Env the worst  but school itself nt that bad,btohqsg
Tbh not sure HAHAHA I don't look down on polys or anything  and I'm not sure which ones are bad,btohqsg
I looking through ite courses rn,btohqsg
if u do super well for pp2 still can wan la,btohqsg
but some of us want cry aft looking at the answers lol,btohqsg
Okay la still can get A,btohqsg
its harder than last yrs one,btohqsg
i think gonna be quite hard,btohqsg
Easier paper less forgiving than hard paper btw,btohqsg
if only amath was as ez as emath,btohqsg
hi does anyone have a softcopy of the bio tys?,btohqsg
imagine amath being harder than emath but bellcurve being less forgiving,btohqsg
monday u guys got what paper ah,btohqsg
next week some ppl in 4 days got 6 exam,btohqsg
last yr i had geog amath same day for o levels if i remembered correctly,btohqsg
after ur hand damn tired frm writing 4 page,btohqsg
then imagine they give integrate to find area under curev 13 marks sort,btohqsg
i get finger cramps during every gp/econs paper rn,btohqsg
honesly 1 paper everyday would be btr,btohqsg
After science give 2 week break,btohqsg
Might as well give us 3 day one paper right,btohqsg
it is but guess what seab said fuck u,btohqsg
since they need to follow britan standard or smth,btohqsg
its like 4 more days of hell,btohqsg
then its of to suffering more in jc,btohqsg
Easier paper everyone can score grade boundry very high one mistake can cause a lot of mistakes like no ecf etc,btohqsg
and i havent start memorising lol gg for me,btohqsg
Harder paper most ppl ant score,btohqsg
screw this man after 4 yrs of hell im going poly,btohqsg
Ull be given a lot of ecf,btohqsg
Yo quick question  the last qns of paper 1 how many marks?,btohqsg
Isit just me or when check answer,btohqsg
then got tchrs say ppr 2 might be tough also,btohqsg
istg whats with cambridge this yr,btohqsg
i heard log trigo coord geo rate of change might be hard,btohqsg
no chance of me passing then :(,btohqsg
then the discriminant and completing the square,btohqsg
they also say the explanation will be damn weird,btohqsg
Don’t be feared that it’s gonna be harder. Calm down  read the questions carefully and try solving,btohqsg
Cambridge fucking ALL OF US over,btohqsg
It is possible that both paper will be hard.,btohqsg
i just finish my phy paper for tmr tuition lol,btohqsg
the procrastination is real lol 😂,btohqsg
I slack from just now sincr a math ended,btohqsg
I gonna sleep then start chiong,btohqsg
A shit ton of ppl are,btohqsg
You always vibing in the music corner,btohqsg
Oof soon it will be gone,btohqsg
I need to study with music,btohqsg
So many ppl in call rn,btohqsg
The kinematic question part 2 i did in foolscap,btohqsg
But i got write the qustion number,btohqsg
As in i didnt wrote in the question paper refer to fooscap,btohqsg
Depends if the marker i guess,btohqsg
Bruh the invigilater ask me just write name centre number and stuff,btohqsg
Ya same so shd b ok,btohqsg
A lot of ppl did worse than you,btohqsg
I just estimate my mark uh count a few time,btohqsg
In my sch got a lot of ppl like that,btohqsg
I heard some people get 30/80...,btohqsg
Just pray for the paper to be doable,btohqsg
And hopefully i don't ge stuck on a careless mistake for like 30 min,btohqsg
yeahi did a careless mistake and im like why is my area negative?,btohqsg
Idk how to do it also,btohqsg
You may need to split the integral then,btohqsg
nah i just calculate wrongly lol,btohqsg
Shd have method marks for that rite,btohqsg
Theres a disc group for this?,btohqsg
Tbh 55 is q good alr,btohqsg
yeah but it’s a confessions subreddit*,btohqsg
i think this is okay tho,btohqsg
but they did say that their uncle doesn’t take money out of his pockets,btohqsg
so it would be gone anyway after the laundry,btohqsg
bc he forgets  so it's still stealing imo,btohqsg
Did anybody here see kwpstudies’ reddit post about SS and history?,btohqsg
Angone got tips for Mondays SS Paper??,btohqsg
i dont even need to study for SS,btohqsg
oH iM sO sOrRy I aM sTupiD,btohqsg
ss just learn the formats for sbq cus u cant rlly study how to infer the source,btohqsg
for the last 2 qns worth like 14 marks i have notes for them,btohqsg
I die during the ss paper,btohqsg
arent the last 2 qns based on the textbook chapters,btohqsg
like u just need to elab like shit,btohqsg
Explains my constant incompetence in 2a,btohqsg
