#TEAMSCDwill be hosting a meet again after quite a while! The meet will be hosted at Changi Village Public Carpark 1 and 2 on 25 June 2022 from 6pm onwards! Drivers headed to the meet should take note of the obvious rules set by the LTA or TP such as:No convoys  revving or burnouts will be allowed and also do take note that there is a speedcam nearby the carpark.It is meant to be a chill meeting for us to gather and chitchat  so do look forward to that! For more information  do join their groupchat!https://t.me/SGCARDISCUSSION,btohqsg
