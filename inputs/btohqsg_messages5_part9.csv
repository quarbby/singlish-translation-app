and your birth cert I think,btohqsg
Ah I see! Thanks a lot! First timer here ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
oh now then I got what you mean  means your parents are staying oversea but their official home address here is the one on their IC,btohqsg
Yeah  kind of. But due to some complications  my mumâ€™s residency is within 4km (on ic). But my parents still owns a flat together(out side of 4km).Both are overseas still. ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
So due to my condition  Iâ€™m wondering if this is applicable for MCPS.,btohqsg
I dont have the option to reselect another town,btohqsg
if you are really wish to book another flat and cancel the previous one  i think you should call HDB first thing monday! since thatâ€™s the last day,btohqsg
To make an enquiry  please go to MyRequest@HDB or call our Sales/Resale Customer Service Line at 1800-8663066 during office hours  Monday to Friday  8.00am to 5.00pm.,btohqsg
not sure if they take such requests but worth a shot,btohqsg
After may SBF  when the next one gonna be?,btohqsg
To my understanding  regardless or how dire your situation or reason is  I dun think HDB will acceed to let u change just like that. You will be first in the history since Singapore's independence.,btohqsg
well somebodyâ€™s got to set a precedent right ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
should be the add shown on your parents IC  to be taken into consideration for the proximity scheme,btohqsg
We bought a resale flat and took the grant but never ballot BTO before. Are we consider as first timer?,btohqsg
hawt line to call hdb  the staffs are sure to get bombarded by questions from the applicants,btohqsg
hmm amendment of the flat type...,btohqsg
just think carefully before you spend another $10,btohqsg
Should be able to cancel your current application then reapply,btohqsg
Last time can just cancel online,btohqsg
Hey guys! Thanks for all the responses. I managed to cancel my first application and have submitted a new application,btohqsg
are units really unbearably hot w fan if half the year the sunlight directly shines into the house?,btohqsg
no idea  anyone else can help@Mini_vivi?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know  if me and my fiancÃ© are planning to apply for SBF  and example the SBF is already built and ready to move in  but we have yet to ROM is it possible ? Is there like a timeline for example you must produce the ROM cert within 6 month of applying if we manage to get the house ?,btohqsg
Sorry  yeah as in can apply and also as long as produce the cert within 6 mth after?,btohqsg
fiancÃ© /fiancÃ©e must produce their marriage cert for inspection by HDB within 3 months after taking possession of the flat,btohqsg
If u dont have cert when your house is ready must appeal for the within 3 months after possession,btohqsg
After hearing that from the hdb  i didnt want to have the hassle to appeal and hence planning an earlier wedding to meet the date.,btohqsg
OK though I married before applying BTO,btohqsg
this is a very helpful site to calculate your stamp duties upon payment on your 2nd appt aka signing of lease of agreement LOA,btohqsg
note that the ABSD is based on 5% (if any is below 30yo) for two main applicants,btohqsg
you still have to pay 10% if both of you are above 30yo at the time of BTO application,btohqsg
The 5%/10% thing is only for downpayment,btohqsg
No ABSD if you don't already own a property,btohqsg
yeah my ABSD refers to down-payment  I was just following what was stated on the site,btohqsg
Hi All  would like to ask if my parents house currently under SERS(enblock). And I would like to apply BTO staying near parents shld I put my new address or old address when applying?,btohqsg
you mean you want to apply MCPS?,btohqsg
have to check with your HDB branch by calling them,btohqsg
Planning to married but not yet ðŸ˜‚ consider under mcps?,btohqsg
Are u referring to correspondence address or mcps address?,btohqsg
Can  if the bto you're applying for is within 4km of parents hse,btohqsg
The site didn't refer to ABSD as downpayment ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
With current address or the new one?,btohqsg
U non citizen? My absd shows 0,btohqsg
Not sure about this  better to check with hdb.,btohqsg
which part am I not sounding like a sinkie sia,btohqsg
I look like non sinkie to you ah,btohqsg
Ok not sure what you selected to get 5% absd,btohqsg
so obvious my wife is PR lah lol,btohqsg
Ok lah then the 5% ABSD is coz your wife PR,btohqsg
so I just followed what it was stated there  hence the confusion here,btohqsg
