That Avante looks a bit long,btohqsg
I know that’s the model code but I just find it a bit long compared to the last gen,btohqsg
Maybe it’s angular styling gives off that impression,btohqsg
Somehow prefer the look of older model.. more proportionate.. my friend drive say a rugged and problem free car.. solid body and fuss free in terms of maintenance..new one looks like space ship and longish…  errr,btohqsg
It is long and wide for its class. 4710mm long and 1825mm wide. Unlike its competitors like altis and mazda 3 which are smaller,btohqsg
