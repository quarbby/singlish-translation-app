just don‚Äôt make it my problem,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt support but I don‚Äôt immediately say to someone ‚Äúoh the devil is gonna capture you‚Äù,btohqsg
i mean in general with these sorts of things is just don‚Äôt make it my business,btohqsg
I have friends who are lgbtq who respect my religion,btohqsg
i‚Äôll care when i have a reason to,btohqsg
i mean i just support people in believing and doing what they want to,btohqsg
but there‚Äôs certain points where belief and logic clash,btohqsg
like the science thing is a point where i draw the line lol,btohqsg
I only explain when they wanna know,btohqsg
like trying to force others to accept lgbtq is no diff from people trying to force religion onto others,btohqsg
imo i feel like not everyone has to support but just dont attack ppl for existing,btohqsg
if you dl then just dont interact with them and dont talk to them ever,btohqsg
i mean there‚Äôs a line between supporting and tolerance,btohqsg
but just internalise the concept of the world doesn‚Äôt revolve around you,btohqsg
i wanna buy a small carrot plush for my bunny,btohqsg
so she has a mini treato,btohqsg
bc god respects your free will so much that he allowed you to freely choose,btohqsg
did you know that carrots are basically drugs for rabbits,btohqsg
yea actl its btr for rabbits to eat lettuce,btohqsg
Happy Pi day to all ! üòÅ,btohqsg
why the username going off the reactions,btohqsg
idk what my sis did in school but got these 3 people (i forgot what my sis did to trigger them and kick start the bullying) who call her homophobic and announce to the whole world,btohqsg
i just rmb in sec school  one of my classmates sole intention was to disruptclass.soclass after class  lesson after lesson. he would be disruptive...purposely scored badly in psle and decided he wanted to mess with a whole class for 2 straight years...rope in classmates to slack off and not pay attention.After he did his damage and my class became notorious  bro was found to have a iq of abt 150-170 and migrated to express in another school after 2 years.None of my classmates nor the teachers did anything or could do anything for the 2 years,btohqsg
my sis denied she did anything to give them a sign she is homophobic  but bruh wth...like u can bully by other means but by calling someone homophobic and announcing it to the whole world???,btohqsg
she complaining about her school nonstop then she wanted to transfer out but end up not doing so coz she said she got the subject combi she wanted,btohqsg
yea...actually my mum first reaction was to ask her what she did that told them she may be homophobic  i wun be surprised if she actually did something,btohqsg
but afterall they were 14 so u can expect 14y/o act,btohqsg
first time hearing people purposely do shit???,btohqsg
i think ive said this story in this channel before way back...but yea  i was sec 1  and at sec 3..when he left  That was a very eye opening experience for me. To know that how unfair this world could be.In just the 3 years from2017-2020..when i ended sec 3  i saw a class and cohort caning in 2 separate years...all the participants were from the same exact group that one guy formed in my class for that 2 years,btohqsg
it is new thing to me  i cant imagine why would anyone do that if he is capable of doing well and get it over and done w in one setting,btohqsg
its a thing  students have been known to do during psle,btohqsg
wait like the whole class got caning???,btohqsg
he just formed a group of slackers/trouble makers..majority from my class and roped in some others from other classes. He was rich  he was smart. That was the nail in the coffin.,btohqsg
the form teacher that took us relayed the info,btohqsg
wah so all of them got into disciplinary issues ah,btohqsg
i doubted it until he transferred to a express stream in monfort,btohqsg
then his iq is not matching his actions,btohqsg
he was a normal academic student in my neighbourhood school,btohqsg
so he decided that it is enough of trouble making,btohqsg
so everyone that he roped in got caned?,btohqsg
he was the same guy that got canned in class for stealing from public convenience stores,btohqsg
wait why is this a school matter,btohqsg
i mean if you can doubt his iq..but idk how you can doubt his eq,btohqsg
this was some 100iq brain move..or basically destructive behaviour ive first encountered in my life,btohqsg
good for him ur school did not do public caning,btohqsg
some school spank in the hall during assembly,btohqsg
oh then the following year  public canning happened to 3 of his friends..for posting on social media about them throwing wet tissue in toilet ceilings,btohqsg
wah so he lucky caned in class  then his friends spanked in front of the cohort,btohqsg
but stealing is more serious tho,btohqsg
wait just posting that video resulted in caning,btohqsg
