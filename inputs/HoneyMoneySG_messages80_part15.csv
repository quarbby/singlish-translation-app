Hi I have a question on my parents CPF. They have already retired many years and 70+. They have limited money in CPF and previously self employed hawker center. I saw they have some amount in OA and do you think it’s better to transfer to MA or keep in RA or SA. I’m thinking no point keep in OA since the interest is too low and cannot take out right unless is RA?,btohqsg
70+ I don't think can transfer over to SA   I not very sure,btohqsg
Strange my parent only has SA account no RA. How to convert to RA,btohqsg
Can login online to change ?,btohqsg

Between ocbc Frank and dbs live fresh  which is better,btohqsg
Hey guys just want to check if anyone managed to redeemed this these 2 days ?,btohqsg
Y? Doesnt ocbc Frank don't  differentiate between online and contactless   which make it easier,btohqsg
theres always FX risk so some people prefer to deal in sgd fund because of that,btohqsg
So for dbs live fresh  must spend $300 for each category?,btohqsg
$200 to $400 each cat  make up total min $600,btohqsg
So if $200 for the online  then I must clock $400 for the contactless?,btohqsg
yes to get 5% that is,btohqsg
So if clock $600 for live fresh  mean get about $30 cashback,btohqsg
yes with additional 5% cashback for green merchants e.g. simplygo,btohqsg
If you can fully optimise $800 to include all the cashbacks  meaning $400 online and $400 contactless  and within those $800 you also clock $300 sustainable  you get 6.88% effective cashback rate.,btohqsg
Any recommendations for supplementary credit card to get with a partner? Preferably no min spend and cash back focused thanks,btohqsg

hi all  for the UOB national savings promotion (im assuming that the cut off date  if it happens will be on 31 Dec 2023 as cut off). Seeing that 31 Dec 2023 is a sunday  was thinking of keeping the account balance at 0 from 29 - 31 Dec 2023 instead to be safe. anyone has thoughts on this?,btohqsg
Somebody has same thought on this earlier. You can search chat history using “uob promo 30” to see what others reply to him.,btohqsg
I won't use YouTrip in this scenario.if you hit max rewards limit on your card that pairs with Instarem I suggest to deposit SGD to Amaze Wallet using a linked MasterCard. you then spend using Amaze Wallet balance which gives you much better FX rate than using linked CC. Also  foreign currency spend on Amaze Wallet earns more InstapointsMoreover  if the MasterCard you use to top up Wallet has GIRO setup with HSBC EGA  you get 1% indirectly from HSBC Everyday+ bonus,btohqsg
Hello everyone  can I clarify if I hit the annual CPF contribution cap of 37 740  does that mean I cannot do any voluntary contribution for tax relief? And can I still do for parents top up for relief then?,btohqsg
U can still do VCMA or RTSU for tax relief. For parents  also eligible so long they qualify for it,btohqsg
YS Lee  is using amaze paired with Mastercard better than using youtrip?,btohqsg
