First paper alr got something out of syllabus,btohqsg
The tutors actually wrote to SEAB,btohqsg
Sometimes csq they like to use alot of terms that are not in syllabus also,btohqsg
Then clarified it was legit out of syllabus,btohqsg
Knowledge about gini is fine but calculating is like not in syllabus,btohqsg
Is quantitative easing in syllabus actually,btohqsg
They pump money into the economy when there liquidity trap,btohqsg
Comp sci theory and application is a whole new lvl,btohqsg
They cant cut interest rates any further,btohqsg
Ya that one for sure is inside,btohqsg
But idk if they taught the counter fo it,btohqsg
But like in CSQ if they introduce something confirm have to explain,btohqsg
Idm this type of new shit it’s just whether I can understand what it does,btohqsg
Ya but sometimes they explain so vague,btohqsg
Anyways if it requires some economic analysis H1 doesn’t have then confirm will not test,btohqsg
H1 very unlikely to have new stuff coz of the limited economic analysis tools we have,btohqsg
We only have DD/SS with PED/PES  benefit-cost analysis and AD/AS,btohqsg
PPC and AS are our only kinky curves,btohqsg
Anyways econs kinda rip for my class,btohqsg
Imagine ur wrist pain from essay then still have FM to study,btohqsg
But u study fm then math easy game,btohqsg
But like a bit worrying for those who do badly for FM,btohqsg
Coz they know they have to not flunk it,btohqsg
But also at the same time they relying on their H2 econs,btohqsg
Those who do fm are prob those who are v confident with their math,btohqsg
No my school has no hybrid so FM was the only way to remove their 2nd science,btohqsg
So there are those who took it for the sake of removing the 2nd science,btohqsg
All the chem students wanted to remove their physics/bio,btohqsg
The standard deviation for exam scores in my class is 20,btohqsg
One of my classmates confirm wanted to use his FM as the H1 RP,btohqsg
And his H2 econs is like quite gud coz internals he got B,btohqsg
Then end up his As econs C and FM B,btohqsg
I think can kinda blame the FM econs same day thing,btohqsg
I had a friendEcons HOD said he super upz and his internal percentiles above 90Actual A lvl grade was a B,btohqsg
I also kena same shit but mine was H1 econs,btohqsg
Ah fellow H1 Econs boi here,btohqsg
I was like 1 mark away from A for prelims then kena C for As,btohqsg
My sch dominates in h1But is the h2 ppl that got rekted,btohqsg
Lol i rmb my prelim was a D,btohqsg
Cos i hardly used economic analysis,btohqsg
So my cher just spam L1/1,btohqsg
But econs should be q ok still,btohqsg
Iirc my sch h1 econs dist rate was almost 50% for my cohort,btohqsg
Yea but I think it was quite tragic bah,btohqsg
I have heard of ppl 100 percentile in prelims get B in a level,btohqsg
Now I can’t even know my percentile in school,btohqsg
I rmb how my cher denied me my last mark for an A for gp in prelims  saying its for my 'own good',btohqsg
Eh A for internal exams for gp is crazy leh,btohqsg
In the end also get A,btohqsg
I thought i would get A sia,btohqsg
