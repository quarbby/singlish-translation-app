To whom this may concern Please accept this letter as formal notification that I am resigning from my position as a NSF Corporal with the Singapore Armed Forces. This letter shall serve as the required one month advanced notice before my final day here.I would like to thank you for the opportunity to work in this position for the past 15 months. I‚Äôve greatly enjoyed the opportunities I‚Äôve had to practice patience and tolerance  and I value the guidance of my superiors in ensuring that my workplace is kept neat and tidy. I‚Äôve learned exactly what to avoid in order to foster a good workplace culture  and how to motivate staff. Perhaps most importantly  your organization has taught me how to accomplish my work in a safe  reliable  and efficient manner  achieving speed through skill. I will be sure to apply all of these lessons in future places I work in.Career progression has been amazing. Nowhere else in the country can you boast of having a three-time promotion within the span of 15 months - a testament to the value you place on staff development. Salary wise  this amounts to a whopping 11% increase*  which is extremely competitive relative to the private sector.The employment benefits are second to none: Not only is food  accommodation and clothing provided for  this organization has actively invested in the wellbeing of its employees by providing FREE fitness and conditioning programs. Not just that  it actively helps us in achieving those fitness standards  by having complementary trainings on the weekends!I am amazed too  by the healthcare facilities which are foremost and utmost in quality. Never have I seen a company that provides world class medical facilities for its staff to use  free of charge  like the wonderful Pulau Tekong Medical Center.Indeed  words cannot express how grateful am I to have been a part of this amazing organization. The value of my time here cannot be measured in dollars and cents  and the honour and glory of contributing to this organization is mine.Despite this  I have chosen to leave your organization to pursue other goals. It would be unfair to deprive others of a chance to experience this wonderful place for themselves. I wish it every success in its future endeavors.*70 dollar increase on a 630 dollar base.,btohqsg
