I can call myself uncle liao. This uncle here see for 20 years,btohqsg
Are portfolio like testimonials written by chers,btohqsg
Fortpolio is a list of things you've done,btohqsg
what’s of even trying to excel if this happens,btohqsg
no. Means what u have done,btohqsg
No thats like ur sch portfolio,btohqsg
While there may or may not be a school bias in med school admissions  there is no way to confirm or deny this so don't think too hard about it,btohqsg
U need extra extra curricular  portfolio,btohqsg
Admissions are not solely reliant on rank point,btohqsg
ahhh okay thanks for the reassurance,btohqsg
There's no rule saying 'if you get 90 you get instant entry into med school',btohqsg
but remember good results is only a door opener,btohqsg
I feel like tagging jay again,btohqsg
Admissions are based on their assessment of your interview  your fortpolio  and yes your grades,btohqsg
I want to try finding internship after As but idk if can,btohqsg
Got more behind I lazy take,btohqsg
I got alot of lobang one,btohqsg
Nobody cares if u do a 100 meaningless things,btohqsg
Thks when i grad  ill ask haha,btohqsg
But if u do 1 or 2 v good things,btohqsg
What if i do 1 meaningless thing 100 times,btohqsg
Learned a lot of things from those experiences,btohqsg
oh my god is this why people say poly is so much more easier,btohqsg
Sorry my existence is meaningless leh,btohqsg
I think poly more commitments leh if u want to go into uni especially,btohqsg
but starting payuni grad > poly grad,btohqsg
Need to be committed to every goddamn proj,btohqsg
Dont use ur NS things hor,btohqsg
Jc u wack once u done,btohqsg
No one cares about NS outside NS,btohqsg
can leh. Scholarship interview that time they very interested,btohqsg
oh yeah JC cert is useless if u cant go into a uni,btohqsg
Aiya NS got advantage and disadvantage one,btohqsg
"Put on linkedin ""I was an Lieutenant in the appointment of Platoon Commander in the Singapore Armed Forces from the year 2020 to 2021""",btohqsg
Jc cert can't buy a plate of chicken rice?,btohqsg
JC cert only good for showing u went JC,btohqsg
and bragging rights if u did well enough,btohqsg
yeah it doesn’t mean crap until u get a degree i’m assuming,btohqsg
or if u sign on army,btohqsg
Is it true that sometimes people dont hire sg males cus they need reservist?,btohqsg
The rare time I come on telegram,btohqsg
Not true for MNCs and govt bodies,btohqsg
Yes  and also someone else can steal their promotion away when they go reservist,btohqsg
ok erm what happens if you can’t make it through promos,btohqsg
Did y'all know with a nitec cert  y'all can become a manager at a fast food restaurant? And with a jc cert you can't cause don't have a skill. (Source last time a hr in some fast food),btohqsg
Either 1) u advance with conditions or 2) u retain,btohqsg
Do some ppl still choose to retain even if they could advance?,btohqsg
Seriously  if u need tuition help in JC  find one before it gets too late to catch up. Any tutor u think is able to help.,btohqsg
Its a bit difficult to retain unless u dun care,btohqsg
Nitec at least got learn skills no?,btohqsg
trust me  1 year time is a lot,btohqsg
especially for guys already 2 yrs in NS,btohqsg
My friend got like straight Us but somehow eligible for advancement,btohqsg
No ? As all the fkers before me have said,btohqsg
If u want to chsnge subjects  sometimes u gotta retain,btohqsg
Then the following year he honours roll for promos,btohqsg
depends on sch and paper difficulty,btohqsg
But straight Us is always a bad sign,btohqsg
has anyone seen a jc student drop to poly before,btohqsg
Okay it was fun being back here after62528363months,btohqsg
Promos are like prelim before Os?,btohqsg
I shall go back to my slumber,btohqsg
Got jc students transfer to another jc b4 lol,btohqsg

Got...some are like dsa but cannot survive there...need a sch which is closer to the student's standard,btohqsg
Mi got 3 years of educstion thou,btohqsg
"There's this YouTube channel u shld watch called ""Unfiltered"" I think they got discuss that",btohqsg
Yeee that's why I asked if u accept mi as a jc,btohqsg

at least within J1 mid year,btohqsg
Rip at least prob got scholars his age,btohqsg
sec 5 > ite > poly > ns,btohqsg
Scholars/foreighers like always 1 or 2 years older than everyone,btohqsg
JC starts Feb and ends next year Oct. Before 1 mth of A level.Is < 2 years,btohqsg
I from plat 3 now gold4,btohqsg
In uni  is it  essential to really join those clubs to create more connections etc etc,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAH NEED GET BACK TO PLAT ISSIT,btohqsg
is it compulsory to take cca,btohqsg
Mayhaps 🤪 bx now more int in girls than me,btohqsg
yes but you have to find the right people,btohqsg
Let the right one come lah,btohqsg
JC and uni are really great opportunities to meet new people,btohqsg
Honestly  unless u wanna go med or something  i think cca is irrelevant,btohqsg
but if you do  you get extra credit right,btohqsg
ive met more ppl in ns,btohqsg
I wouldn't recommend like being a hermit in your precious youth,btohqsg
Too late im already an incel,btohqsg
And im not talking about ur peers,btohqsg
Those are especially the courses u need,btohqsg
All NS experiences about there one,btohqsg
Thats what gives u competitive edge,btohqsg
Yes but if u really want that course and ur points don't make it  portfolio can give u a chance through ABA,btohqsg
all schs are lousy (except acsi),btohqsg
U have 90 rp i have90 rp who should go,btohqsg
ACS - The best that was never be,btohqsg
Maybe his tier list is ACSI > others > RI,btohqsg
If ri lousy sch  the rest of them oso lousy,btohqsg
What even is extra extra  curricular portfolio 😩🤡,btohqsg
My RI teacher back in 1990s taught us that 😂,btohqsg
The one I send lor jn,btohqsg
Its just those things that u do outside sch,btohqsg
you know the only sch in god tier is NUSH,btohqsg
Does anyone know how i can build up portfolio for business admin/econs in jc?,btohqsg
This sch i can never compete w,btohqsg
Unless u want to do anything humans related i guess,btohqsg
I open my mouth only kena shut,btohqsg
Scholarships. My family not that well to do,btohqsg
there are music gods there too  ironically,btohqsg
90 rp NUS gives u scholarship,btohqsg
Those done during sec sch counted?,btohqsg
Unfortunately scholarships-wise you can't run away from grades  so may as well aim for 90,btohqsg
As long its not from sch or sch related its more meaningful obv doesnt hold tru for everything,btohqsg
They didn't rly look at my sec,btohqsg
Yea ok i aiming for my sch average lol,btohqsg
Since it shows u went out of the way to pursue it,btohqsg
Oni my job shadowing + intern,btohqsg
Work hard. I was only average in secondary sch. Only managed to improve in JC,btohqsg
Volunteering doesnt show ur interest for econs and bsuiness now does it,btohqsg
What do u plan to pursue?,btohqsg
bruh my secondary sch testimonial is not even half a page coz i wasn’t in sch for half a year,btohqsg
Regardless of if its for portfolio or not,btohqsg
I think sports abit pointless in jc no offence unless u wanna go into sports after jc,btohqsg
so does it matter or no the secondary sch one,btohqsg
HAHAH sorry i ask the dumbest questions,btohqsg
My teacher says no one gives af abt ur syf or whatever sports championship u got,btohqsg
It matters if u want to DSA via portfolio,btohqsg
Its fine we be dumb together,btohqsg
Is it dumb to move from aesthetics cca to sports cca,btohqsg
Not everything u do in JC needs to be about improving ur portfolio/grades,btohqsg
pls i went from uniform to library,btohqsg
Lol does being a secretary of a student initiated grp for econs count haha,btohqsg
How would ik u should know if its meaningful or not,btohqsg
problem is A level is still about grades,btohqsg
and uni entry majority is also about grades,btohqsg
I uniform grp + performing arts,btohqsg
what…..how did u eveb manage 😭,btohqsg
I think if ur future uni course got a relvevant cca  u shd go for that cca.,btohqsg
I also not from CS haha,btohqsg
All along my cca has been  dance in pri    orchestra in sec   I still don't understand music theory 💀😩😭,btohqsg
But do u consider those places to be meaninfulnor not,btohqsg
CS is good. Fresh grad pay from Shopee ard 8k/mth,btohqsg
A jc  haven't rlly decide on specific jcs,btohqsg
Shd check on the h3s in case then,btohqsg
What course u wanna do in da future,btohqsg
I was in music cca from pri to jc. Also don't know music theory,btohqsg
They will drag u to take student loan,btohqsg
Yea heard a lot of bad shit from my friends there,btohqsg
Science related  medical field. Searched uni perquisites  alot of courses to choose from but haven't briefly  research on those courses yet,btohqsg
what subjs would you guys recommend for a student aiming 4 jc w combi sci,btohqsg
My friend say he walk pass toilet saw someone come out with blood,btohqsg
I can suggest u a poly course which can help u in those,btohqsg
which month. I ask my students,btohqsg
What future uni course u want?,btohqsg
He told me q a while back,btohqsg
dentistry i think h2 phys chem is important,btohqsg
And there isn't projects (in case u no like social interaction),btohqsg
start from what u want in uni,btohqsg
But the down side is alot ppl dl the poly lol,btohqsg
I dare say with combi sci and no CLT  H2 sciences will confirm be an ultimate challenge,btohqsg
standard term for physics chem maths econs,btohqsg
But if u combined sci  u shd study the syllabus b4 u start jc,btohqsg
Actually nvm even if ur pure  study it,btohqsg
JC sciences chapters build on one another,btohqsg
Im sure those in poly love poly,btohqsg
Isit ? Tell me how tf is crystal field theory,btohqsg
@mersculawhy that course u might ask,btohqsg
Biomed seems like a tedious course,btohqsg
Low chance of uni  low wages,btohqsg
Cuz horh u can go nie be  sci cher / go polyclinic work / clinics lor,btohqsg
Source i am BME student in NTU,btohqsg
If someone likes chem  what course wld u recommend for them? Cus idw my cousin life to be fucked,btohqsg
future job is wash test tubes we say,btohqsg
Do u think jc is a better option for someone who like chem?,btohqsg
But future of SG hard to say,btohqsg
If u like chem and only chem  u can learn more indepth in poly,btohqsg
This one idk how to help oop,btohqsg
my time programming was hard to find job and low pay,btohqsg
just few years later it's so hot,btohqsg
Idk eh i think my cousin got misconception that poly not tough,btohqsg
Anyone recommend a uni for CS,btohqsg
LHL maths major but u don't see everyone lining up to do maths,btohqsg
@TanJunWeido u do tis in uni I'm just curious,btohqsg
She want to pick the less stressed route. So idk. I only know biomed abit cannot ah,btohqsg
Time to make my own graphics card on breadboards,btohqsg
What are the benefits of a maths major?,btohqsg
I was just playing Ard W leftover ic,btohqsg
esp if they wanna make it to uni right?,btohqsg
Maths is one step away from any major stem discipline,btohqsg
U can be in finance sector as analyst,btohqsg
So u can basically go anywhere if u specialise,btohqsg
statisticians are also employed by QA,btohqsg
Just don't do pure maths if u want a job,btohqsg
But not really skills in demand,btohqsg
anyone in the arts stream hoping to be a journalist?,btohqsg
I'm gonna do applied maths and pure maths as a hobby,btohqsg
I thot journalist shd go poly?,btohqsg
Pure refers to the more abstract maths,btohqsg
I'm always wondering abt maths majors,btohqsg
And she failed a level then go poly,btohqsg
Anyhow choose but i loved it,btohqsg
Ur friends all got such interesting stories,btohqsg
Eg a standard part of pure maths is real analysis  which is about studying the real numbers,btohqsg
I always fail in jc math,btohqsg
ik someone from acjc wanting to do journalism,btohqsg
As u can see this is not very useful in real life,btohqsg
why they chose maths as a major,btohqsg
Cos jc i was taught just memorise ...,btohqsg
Hows acjc? I heard q bad eh is it true?,btohqsg
What to do if u got 1k + friends online who rants to u abt their life,btohqsg
I dun get it and hate it,btohqsg
my tutor’s a math major lol she doesn’t know why she took it,btohqsg
U block cus thats not a healthy situation,btohqsg
Uni math is good for me,btohqsg
no….he had a blast in there LOL,btohqsg
Acjc people always run to defend acjc,btohqsg
But u love listening to rants,btohqsg
I think that's a better sense of what the school is like,btohqsg
I only know I wanted engineering after O level,btohqsg
My friend say all the party people with 5 girlfriends etc,btohqsg
At least we understand how things work thru proofs,btohqsg
John and me are not party animals,btohqsg
You don't need to participate in that environment if you don't want to,btohqsg
Because I absolutely love maths and science. And especially circuits,btohqsg
You can still have fun in acjc,btohqsg
i mean yeah do have a reputation,btohqsg
I have heard some absurd rumours about acjc like we have a separate canteen for rich people,btohqsg
Because party guys dun need gf and commitment,btohqsg
In ns u got a wife thou,btohqsg
i shall not say anything any further,btohqsg
Talk about urself bro i not from SAF,btohqsg
Some people knows SAF as Sir Alex F,btohqsg
Idk ig i heard bad things from almost all jcs,btohqsg
the only one i haven’t heard any shit of is from jpjc,btohqsg
The only one I never hear anything about is NYJC,btohqsg
Go ACJC to score As and Cs and EJC to score Es,btohqsg
U dont have the right friends,btohqsg
Is it just me or what the weather these days hot asf,btohqsg
it’s always ACJC and NJC lmao,btohqsg
A guy from asrjc tried to evangelise me on a train,btohqsg
Acjc gets a lot of shit for some reason,btohqsg
My friend who used to go to church with him said he evangelised a maths teacher. Whether this is true idk,btohqsg
if going JC  please read up on CLT,btohqsg
Oh damn ok I get it,btohqsg
don't wait till J2 to realise u need it,btohqsg
O lvl students dont know this leh,btohqsg
What sub is quantum field theory  central limit theorem and crystal field theory are from,btohqsg
I thot njc pw is the worst haha,btohqsg
NJC got results cannot argue with it,btohqsg
I used to post on sgforums with bedokfunland to help students,btohqsg
It’s the worst of all JCs,btohqsg
I thought YI PW > CJ PW,btohqsg
Nj peeps make it seem like hell to me. For them to choose their grps  they need do litersture tests. They only get their grps in June etc,btohqsg
i guess MI is working it’s way up,btohqsg
I always think of that when I use the powerbank,btohqsg
Yeah i'm not saying it's like the best  but clearly it somehow works given that they do achieve pretty good results,btohqsg
Tho it's alr lower for commerce stream,btohqsg
To go commerce it's 17 -18,btohqsg
It will always be 21-20 range,btohqsg
U dont have a form class. Need to bring ur bloody bag everywhere,btohqsg
My time sci was lower lol,btohqsg
And U can take 2 h2 sci if U get b4 and btr for combined sci,btohqsg
The canteen food not bad thou. First time having decent food at canteen,btohqsg
meanwhile there's a question in the study group that no one answers,btohqsg
Its the most useless thing ull do in JC,btohqsg
I took it at O lvl that's it,btohqsg
I chose to do eng lit to siam bio in sec 3,btohqsg
wait why r ppl saying that 💀,btohqsg
A1 only that one important time,btohqsg
Even though my england not good,btohqsg
U can literally sleep in class and still do well its that fking useless. After JC u wont see it again and it will limit the places u can go,btohqsg
Cause eventually in uni u still have to do physics,btohqsg
Wait how is H2 lit like in jc?,btohqsg
Whats h2 hist like? I want to chsnge subj haha,btohqsg
Imagine taking double humanities double sci and triple math,btohqsg
He realised how easily lookable that ques was in his textbook,btohqsg
ack my english isn’t too bad but idk if i wanna pursue it,btohqsg
Idk but I can speak for ell,btohqsg
H2 lit and history don't have super tutors around,btohqsg
Oh i thot the 10A1 scholar lol,btohqsg
I last did hist in sec 2 and next time i took it was in uni,btohqsg
In a span of 2 years?,btohqsg
No diff. Not like i have money to sfford tutors,btohqsg
Lifehack: You don't actually have to read finish the books,btohqsg
I think my pure math in uni helped me in hist,btohqsg
I already can’t cope with 2 books in pure lit🥲,btohqsg
there's a lot of free stuff ard for econs,btohqsg
U dont have to read them at all,btohqsg
lit and hist I not sure,btohqsg
Actually you dont have to read them at all,btohqsg
Which book u reading I see if I got notes from last time,btohqsg
You just study the notes u were given,btohqsg
In uni must learn physics again?,btohqsg
Hist in uni surprisingly dun need to memorise alot of facts,btohqsg
U can almost go ri as asean scholar lol,btohqsg
The value is in using logic to argue your point,btohqsg
Which i thank my math for it,btohqsg
Just read like 8-9 times can alr,btohqsg
Pure maths thinking is helpful basically everywhere,btohqsg
Is that why preferably ppl choose phy/chem in jc..?,btohqsg
Take for fun...i took 4 hist mod,btohqsg
Wo chinese also mot very bagus,btohqsg
Yeah the novel is fun but I don’t understand Shakespearean plays😭,btohqsg
This is why u do elect,btohqsg
Chose the mod the hist majors are taking lol,btohqsg
This is why watch short clips of lit,btohqsg
Honestly from what i seen pcme is dominsted by males,btohqsg
chose a 3rd language while I'm bad at language 😅,btohqsg
For lit my observation is if u really go and mug the book it doesn't really help u more than if u study the notes on the book,btohqsg
Es ist in Ordnung  schlecht in Sprachen zu sein,btohqsg
bruh isn’t that the one that u suggested i should take,btohqsg
My T test shows no significant difference,btohqsg
Cos the girl i had a crush on took those modules,btohqsg
So like jst go through the in depth analysis?,btohqsg
What u can summarize out of the book,btohqsg
Wow u very romantic ah not bbfa,btohqsg
Thanks yall for the 2 cents  definitely keep it in mind :D,btohqsg
But she is not my wife...,btohqsg
Yeah just study the analysis of the text rather than the text itself,btohqsg
@DharshhaFahrenheit 451Part one : the hearth and the salamanderClarisse first meeting with montag :“ are you happy ? She said ““Happy ! Of all the nonsense .

You analyse the text urself is like you reinventing the wheel,btohqsg
My wife is my JC cca mate,btohqsg
Can be instructive but the wheel is already there so,btohqsg
My wife was my math course mate,btohqsg
bruh my teacher met his wife in the army,btohqsg
FMaths is more to the applied side,btohqsg
If I take hmt I can still take mt in jc right even though it’s optional?,btohqsg
Don't get a r/s till uni,btohqsg
But why would u want to,btohqsg
Fmath is more useful than h2 maths,btohqsg
If fmath is like Amath  I'm gonna take it,btohqsg
