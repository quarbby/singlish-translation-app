i'm just pique that no one seemed to care when i brought up the issue and dun even have it fixed  from test drive to nego...i kept saying,btohqsg
and i thot it will be fixed when collecting car. end up nothing done. pfffttt,btohqsg
Next time stand your ground and say fix it up,btohqsg
Sorry so now they want to fix or dun want?,btohqsg
Btw   it may not be the switch alone  if need to change the motor  could be a few hundred,btohqsg
Sadly that's how used car dealers work,btohqsg
The Se is seeking second or third or fourth opinion. The mech guy said need to replace the the entire part cos it is moulded to be one piece,btohqsg
Ya so would be a few hundred,btohqsg
But ask then to eat their own $&@&…Lah… dun they have a workshop????,btohqsg
Okay things u need to get done maam. Make sure they fix the entire part because its a latch  dont think they want to weld it.Check for other spoiled parts be it  door locks  open and unlock  ur reverse camera  etc etc,btohqsg
please get all this done before you collect the car,btohqsg
"dont let them use the ""u collected the car already means you approve of the condition of car"" line against you",btohqsg
bro if dealer pay u buy used part for what,btohqsg
You want the dealer to pay?,btohqsg
i think you can drive the car now with the broken latch,btohqsg
if u buy a used part who pay?,btohqsg
if the used part spoil then 3mths ltr buy another one?,btohqsg
its used bro  there is a lifespan of the part,btohqsg
its like i give u 2yo car vs 5yo car for the same price u buy the 5yo one,btohqsg
i dont get whats the issue with getting the dealer to pay for the new part,btohqsg
i will shadow the mech guy throughout,btohqsg
please negotiate that it will be free of charge,btohqsg
ok but if you read  dealer offered to get some quotes and reply back,btohqsg
Means he dun want to pay,btohqsg
we could always bring this up as a lemon vehicle,btohqsg
chill guys....i will wanna make the dealer be responsible for things that i found before i purchase,btohqsg

But this latch can be consider safety also,btohqsg
we don't know the whole interaction so not sure,btohqsg
its not the switch break bro,btohqsg
