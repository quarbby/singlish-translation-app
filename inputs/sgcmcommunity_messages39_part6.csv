How many times chin ups you guys do? I can only do 8,btohqsg
I can only hang up there for 8 mins....,btohqsg
With one arm I can only hang for 5 seconds,btohqsg
Really? You don‚Äôt miscount? It‚Äôs chin up you know,btohqsg
And all the way down both arms down and then up,btohqsg
We need to remember to work on our own ‚Äúbodykit‚Äù too guys and gals,btohqsg
8 is very good sir. Gold liao I think,btohqsg
Yes sir. I worked upwards from 12 and every morning pull before starting work,btohqsg
On top of that I still play badminton and tennis with boss every week.,btohqsg
Vehicle Engine and gearbox spoil can change. We mostly get only one chance with our own bodies‚Ä¶,btohqsg
any workshop for horn replacement to recommend?,btohqsg
want to change to louder one... the current one very soft ü•≤,btohqsg
Last time autobacs have on display can test the sound of the horns,btohqsg
Sir.. you really use your horn a lot ah‚Ä¶ standard one seems quite loud to me Liao. But yeah as Mr Rick recommended  Autobacs is one place you can check out.,btohqsg
No choice sir‚Ä¶ bad family genes so better self help first,btohqsg
i almost bought it. but decided i should wait,btohqsg
Autobac UbiAutobac Bukit BatokGot BMW horn.,btohqsg
nice. you are the Alfa Romeo,btohqsg
Do what I can for myself and my family I guess,btohqsg
Wait for Honda to make another 9k rpm type r ? Haha,btohqsg
which civic type r is best handling?,btohqsg
so far only porsches makes 9000 rpm. i hope honda can do that for 4 cylinder engines,btohqsg
i think so too. then why so many say fd2 better,btohqsg
the 2023 type r should better fk8. looks more gentleman and family oriented,btohqsg
and i dont hear honda type r bugggers talk about sound insulation at all.,btohqsg
Vtec turbo corner must faster than fd2.But it feel diff lah.Feel like those Conti hot hatch.Fd2 is na   v raw feel   got crazy 8600 redline.Vtec should be like this lol,btohqsg
never driven the earlier ones but i would expect the EK9 to be the best,btohqsg
or generally i prefer cars that are lighter and more direct,btohqsg
but that one price so inflated,btohqsg
i need subsidies for that siaüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
https://www.caranddriver.com/honda/civic-type-rlooking forward to seeing it for sure!,btohqsg
mx5 is never known to be fastest.,btohqsg
it is just banced and fun and reasonably fast to drive,btohqsg
if u V6 swap a mx-5 it will be fast haha,btohqsg
Crazy. Everyone want to be light n listen to vtec. Buy type r n put sound proof is buy wrong car.,btohqsg
haha thought so... altis buggers are different. they want to insulate their cars to be camry-like,btohqsg
soNgdid you play your fk8r in sepang,btohqsg
I don't have fk8.I only got fd2r.I purchase it just before circuit breaker. No chance for the pas 2 years,btohqsg
coe was not high then. good for you/,btohqsg
so what did you do to the car?,btohqsg
Thats why BMW genius. Use speaker to mimic engine sound while sound proofing on,btohqsg
Lol still not banned. Hope you found your sugar fish,btohqsg
@awj_moodwas it you that did the long post earlier on this?,btohqsg
dont think so. bmw cant make nice sound with its turbo engine.,btohqsg
Their M10 Inline 4 actually sounded nice,btohqsg
B48 and B58 are wonderful sounding engines,btohqsg
nobody can m ake turbo engine sound better than alfa or honda,btohqsg
nah nah Mclarens and Ferraris sound darn good too,btohqsg
you are talking high end sports cars mnakers. they are of different league. BMW audi are mass market makers. terrible,btohqsg
