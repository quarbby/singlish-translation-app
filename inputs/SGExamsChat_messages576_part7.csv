ok maybe this is getting abit biased im gonna be less acoustic,btohqsg
never seen one irl in fact,btohqsg
best prevention ofc is no segs,btohqsg
nat is bringing up valid points though,btohqsg
then that is how you should respond. develop the argument  not shut it down,btohqsg
thats bc u cant handle ur liquor,btohqsg
Convince them otherwise? Damn  never knew that's possible,btohqsg
i rmb putting fake blood all over my face,btohqsg
the rest of the night was js horrendous ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
as someone who doesnt do seggs  uh no condoms do provide a sense of security for those who do want to explore their seggsual side in a much more safer manner than just going in raw. yes  i wouldnt want to have seggs but there are many who may want that but be safe in it. can it still have issues? maybe and that's why i prefer not to  because im not prepared in that low chance  but does it mean its just aids prevention  no,btohqsg
give me a tldr if udm,btohqsg
i would break down nats arguments but i cba,btohqsg
Being gay goes against nature = it is fundamentally flawed,btohqsg
Actually wait he deadass skipped stage 2,btohqsg
"people literally used to try and ""correct"" left handedness",btohqsg
And went from goes against nature = they are a nuisance,btohqsg
who the fuck cares about biological design,btohqsg
well  how about let's try a different argument,btohqsg
should a country (like singapore) try whatever it can to ensure its existence?,btohqsg
if people were so concerned of this the industrial revolution would never happen,btohqsg
So should a country try to remove lgbt people?,btohqsg
Idk I'm trying to understand the qn they asked,btohqsg
The whether it can ensure its existence,btohqsg
yeah let's say we say that national interest takes priority. we need to ensure that 100 years  200 years from now  sg still exists,btohqsg
how far are we willing to do to do this?,btohqsg
But what do lgbt people have to do with national interest,btohqsg
should we even take steps if it seems against personal bodily autonomy and personal choice?,btohqsg
we have a critically low birth rate. does this mean we should not encourage (or discourage  or forbid) condoms  abortion  non-traditional marriage and relationships?,btohqsg
if you think queer people are against personal bodily autonomy and personal choice you need to work on your own perception of queer people,btohqsg
If u r gg the population route  the fundamental issue with that is that gay people are the minority  even if u make all of them have kids that won't change anything,btohqsg
or should we way  personal choice comes first  even if it means no more sg down the road,btohqsg
And the other thing is there's still stuff like ivf which can be ways as to how we can have more ways to increase the population,btohqsg
Being gay does not necessarily mean u cannot have kids  it's how surrogacy works,btohqsg
Actually that may not be true,btohqsg
Preventive checks by Thomas malthus go brr,btohqsg
discouraging contraception/abortion is infringing on women's health and human rights already,btohqsg
Not sure if surrogacy is the right word in this context,btohqsg
did u not see roe v wade,btohqsg
where should the line be drawn?,btohqsg
What she's trying to ask is if the practical reasons for infringing human rights do they outweigh the moral reasons,btohqsg
Which is a very valid tension,btohqsg
why is the discussion revived LOL,btohqsg
should we force more kids on the population  to ensure the country's continued existence?,btohqsg
a light saturday morning chat :),btohqsg
There's a reason why u can argue that we need less gay people to support the populationThat being said  is that a desirable outcome or is that necessarily the best way to support the population?,btohqsg
every chat is heavy in the morning cos i cannot think,btohqsg
Or whenever I need to teach :/,btohqsg
