Girls don’t care cause they can’t relate  at most they see your number 1 photo and sword abit cool,btohqsg
Guys don’t care cos if you officer they hate you if you cb and if you not cb you just their bro,btohqsg
And worst is if you get too psychoed by SAF and being an officer you become this almost Napoleon complex shithead who can’t see beyond army life,btohqsg
It doesn’t rly do anything for you unless you sign on,btohqsg
My own brother in law is a fighter pilot but eh humble as F,btohqsg
Beyond the first year no one cares in uni liao,btohqsg
Not worth the pain for reservist and nsf,btohqsg
Now if the pay is double maybe can say worth,btohqsg
But it’s so shit pay for so much more work don’t bother,btohqsg
That’s wrong bro  so many girls are into anime own,btohqsg
Maybe last time you play too much dota they not happy with u but like  even then I feel like the whole “too nerdy” thing is for those mid 30 and above,btohqsg
30s to 20s nowadays so many Japanese lovers and K-pop lovers and TikTok watchers and gamers,btohqsg
It’s not anything weird any more imo,btohqsg
I think that the people who shamed others for watching anime probably graduated before 2010 lol,btohqsg
I swear every girl I know either loves Japan or anime,btohqsg
And if it’s not they love Korea or K-pop,btohqsg
Ok to be fair maybe cause CS and IT,btohqsg
Guess maybe it is selection bias,btohqsg
But I feel at least half of all women watch anime if they’re under 30,btohqsg
I have watched like 3 animes in my life seriously and not just here and there when someone else is watching. death Note  avatar legend of aang  and haruhi suzumiya,btohqsg
And most of them I watch cos my friend watch lol,btohqsg
I think avatar was on TV,btohqsg
So no other cartoons watch that one  and it’s rly good imo,btohqsg
Death note super interesting story  I would watch even if it was a normal tv show,btohqsg
Haruhi suzumiya is actually incredible also from a story point of view but it went nowhere,btohqsg
Was hoping they would explain who she was,btohqsg
Avatar is like those kind of moral stories they tell children but they put real adult world and consequences in it  I like it a lot.,btohqsg
lol if you judge based on RP they clearly don’t know how different uni is,btohqsg
Oh I watched it here and there when ppl watch but I don’t know the story,btohqsg
Some schoolboy fights in robot suits or smth,btohqsg
yea well your friend dodged the biggest rocket missile bullet if you ask me,btohqsg
I think in the settling in phase they still retain the Jc attitude,btohqsg
The dudes all finish NS suffer enough liao so no more prejudices,btohqsg
esp cos the girls went straight from JC to uni,btohqsg
Within a year they all drop this nonsense liao,btohqsg
When need to wake up for class and you sleep deprived and don’t wear makeup and one fbt and unlaundered shirt,btohqsg
They lose the pretentious attitude lmao,btohqsg
The dudes all revert back to admin ns attire,btohqsg
U should watch the ocs one before u sleep bedok,btohqsg
lol unless you in certain faculties,btohqsg
Sutd was like that  a lot of sleep deprived ppl with no dress sense,btohqsg
No business students or anything like that,btohqsg
Sometimes i get recommended the guards conversion course one,btohqsg
ntu you see the engineering and science vs humans and business,btohqsg
Everyone is Stem or architecture and both don’t need to wayang,btohqsg
Imagine u change civi gonna bookout rdy den hear turnout,btohqsg
And get fk coz u nvr shout loud enough,btohqsg
Still need to dress up and wayang a bit la,btohqsg
Worst part is u already sgt or 2lt rdy still kena treated worst than rec,btohqsg
