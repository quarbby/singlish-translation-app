✈️Pika World Markets Insight✈️💻Microsoft: A dream comes true🖨The latest announcement by Microsoft to buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion is expected to be a massive test for Biden’s administration which is often seen as unfriendly to significant technology acquisition.So far  most of the eyes are on the issue of online advertising dominance  allowing Microsoft to dodge away much of the scrutiny. However  the deal presents complicated relationships. For example  games such as Call of Duty is also popular on competing platforms such as Sony PlayStation. Hence  regulators are likely to request Microsoft not to limit the games by Activision to Xbox.If the acquisition is successful  it will be a giant leap for the company as it dives further into consumers needs and expands its sphere of social interaction  which is increasingly a highly contested sphere.🚧Peloton: Problems surfacing intensify🚦There is plenty of bad news surrounding the company  such as the expected slow down in demand for its products. Consumers are also likely to pay more as an additional $250  and $350 will soon be added as part of the delivery and set up costs for its various product.The price increase is part of the strategy by the company to cope with inflation and supply chain-related costs. However  analysts aren’t warming to the prospects despite possibly adding about $150 million into its fiscal 2023 revenue.Recent news showed that the company is on the route to cost rationalization  resulting in the firing of workers as its cost structure becomes a heavy boat. The axe is likely to chop on the apparel division  which has seen poor sales.🛩Equity markets on the rock🌋Stocks continued its slides after the yield reverse some fall and on track to hit 2%. Pika World expects that the yield to stabilise around 2% to 2.25% as buyers may step in to purchase more bonds and help cap down the yield. As the Fed pumps less money into the economy  we expects the yield to continue its ascent.It is Wednesday  20 Jan  7am in Singapore and 7pm in New York.Pika World hopes everyone a safe trading week ahead!,btohqsg

Vividthree had big unusual volume on this 2 days with price falling on much smaller volume.Metaverse play is a longer term play.Quite obvious the players are in but just flushing weak hands out.Anyways  downside at current price is too limited.Good risk-reward play for this one.Today might be the day they break out and up.Let’s see.
