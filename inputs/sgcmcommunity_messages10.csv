only in malaysia i use ron97 that is because i have no choice,btohqsg
i dont understand it. what do you mean? who sells a car for 17k a year? renting?,btohqsg
anyway  cut to the chase. what did you buy and how much,btohqsg
some cars require Ron 98 (sports car usually)If dont need Ron 98  ron 95 will do.,btohqsg
yes. follow the manuals. even my m3 says ron95 so i use this,btohqsg
honda fk8r for singapore market is made for ron95. the uk gt line edition and japan market are tuned for ron98 and has 320 ps.,btohqsg
malaysia singapore australia markets have lower power rating due to the fuels the UK factory says (though not true) an so they detuned it a bit,btohqsg
Buy car dun even know depreciation ah,btohqsg
kjust tell me the price la,btohqsg
Dun care den tellU no point,btohqsg
Fd2r$87000   10 year coe. In 202087000 / 10 year = 8700 / year.,btohqsg
great car you can keep. honda type r have now gone up in value,btohqsg
nice car. seem fender color is different from the the rest. rersprayed>,btohqsg
but type r engine is great.  i thought of buying a fk8r but eventually dropped it,btohqsg
Many people tell me it's faster but feeling diff.No more 8600 redline   quiet   just don't feel like old type r anymore.,btohqsg
Only NA engines can do 8600 and more. My bmw can do 8400. Nice sound,btohqsg
95. When using 92  engine could knock,btohqsg
Jdm sti can do 8000. But not reliable,btohqsg
8K rpm first thing in mind is always HONDA VTEC KICK IN YO,btohqsg
B series and K20A series engine,btohqsg
Takumi’s racing engine 11K RPM lol,btohqsg
Oh yea I forgot to mention Honda F20C 9K redline engine,btohqsg
I come to realisation that while I want to save the earth by going EV  but the current limited infrastructure and price is just quite ridiculous.I guess my next car will be the new vezel/HRV. 😂😂Sorry Earth. My wallet needs me more. I don’t think the price saving from EV will surpass the price difference. Style vs practicality- I think Im trained to be more pragmatic than stylish.,btohqsg
I think a or mg is cheaper,btohqsg
Infrastructure will potentially be an issue. Yes  govt said they are building more. But I think EV car growth rate will be faster than the rate of new charging port. Imagine queuing for charging port and running around the area to find an empty charging port.Just need a few rotten apples to charge their car and watch a movie   I can foresee it takes at least 5 years plus before there is a new EV norm.,btohqsg
I hope I’m wrong but I doubt so. Now already got ppl gaming the system. We will face more 😂,btohqsg
I still think hybrid is a good compromise.,btohqsg
No choice also   as ice will be phase out,btohqsg
Because of the higher gasoline prices?,btohqsg
Nah  even prices of cooking oil also go up,btohqsg
Some car manufacturers already announced stop producing ice car from 2025 and Singapore will stop issue coe to ice car from 2030,btohqsg
Not about pricing but for climate,btohqsg
Now buying new ice car is at your own risk   as they might be of no value soon,btohqsg
Britain to open first coal mine in 30 years because of sanctions against Russia - The Telegraph.👉 World News | Live,btohqsg
Get the cheapest ev. Renault Zoe,btohqsg
2040 full phase out. I could have changed my car 3 times 😂,btohqsg
Volvo is 100% ev in 2025 right? And you banned gasoline cars in 2030?,btohqsg
Pretty much hard enforcing that ICE cars will no longer able to renew COE by 2040  like how they did to 2 stroke bikes,btohqsg
They need to settle these liability as a lot of ppl will go back to them for parts,btohqsg
No it’s just stop new registrations only.,btohqsg
They don’t want to be bother with Russ part issue,btohqsg
2030 onwards all new registrations should be EVs and those registered now will just gradually be phased out alr.,btohqsg
and when manufacturer stopped supporting the electronics  also gg,btohqsg
Oh. Renew is fine. Since they can export the car out. I change car every 5 years. Ok la. Still long.I will save the earth 5 years later.,btohqsg
Yes so I said good luck lol if insist in ice,btohqsg
Parts might be very expensive as all stop producing,btohqsg
and by that article  I will not be surprised by 2040  they will disallow ICE to renew COE,btohqsg
I think by 2040 you drive an ice u go to jail,btohqsg
BY 2030 u drive an ice you pay sky high parts fee and petrol,btohqsg
it will be the same fate like 2 stroke motorbikes now.,btohqsg
Pardon me for being sounding condescending  I also feel clinging on the ICE era also doenst make sense.,btohqsg
😂😂😂 17 more years. Still damn long. A new born today would be going for NS in that time line,btohqsg
Ya ice is gone for sure alreadg,btohqsg
in case anyone is not aware  2 stroke engine vehicles are not longer allowed to renew coe,btohqsg
It’s just that we no choice. No price parity makes us average car owners very hard to switch.,btohqsg
Don’t buy new ice car just buy a 2nd hand will do,btohqsg
I think the dilemma comes when it is late 2020 going to 2030. Then the qns is your next car is EV or hybrid or ICE. Now seems quite clear,btohqsg
When car manufacturers already said they will stop producing   don’t challenge them,btohqsg
Unless u got too much money to burn,btohqsg
I don’t care. I want to keep my e30. By 2025 I’ll turn it into classic status,btohqsg
I think buying EV car is burning more. Like what many said earlier  price disparity  ownership and inconvenience just make EV not that super attractive now.,btohqsg
Btw is xpeng coming to singapore,btohqsg
Ya it’s a legit question.Im also considering hard what’s next aft the 5 year warranty expires.,btohqsg
Actually the petrol saving is alot   and there is 40 k arf rebate a new mg or byd is really ok for the price   where is the price disparities?,btohqsg
Anyway. Is for discussion. We are not saying that ppl who get EV now is dumb or financially illogical.We just say that we wish Tesla is cheaper and more charging port.We farmer. Not that rich 😂,btohqsg
Tesla is not a mass market car,btohqsg
Thier cheapest car cost around an e class,btohqsg
Though in the US  so many of them makes me think they are actually trying to be.,btohqsg
Not all of them passing the rebates leh.,btohqsg
China excels better in cheaper EVs. haha,btohqsg
We are proud of those early adopters because their feedback will shape the future driving norms in sg.Just that We will probably be later adopter,btohqsg
Got more and more choices alr.,btohqsg
All that’s left right is actually just the way EVs are taxed,btohqsg
Once these 2 are solved  it’ll be better alr for motorists.,btohqsg
Need to have some big policy change to trigger the tipping point,btohqsg
Ya. I will probably a new vezel then 5 years later sell it off for electric car.Looking at BZ4 Toyota EV SUV,btohqsg
Ya BZ4X is a good choice.,btohqsg
It’s just a small downside that there’s no driver memory  otherwise it’s comparable in terms of performance and practicality.,btohqsg
It will be a win so long cars like Honda E gets cheaper. We dont need powerful tesla,btohqsg
Overseas reviews for this car are quite positive. 207hp is quite usable also.,btohqsg
All these are just marketing to win people over ICE,btohqsg
Ya. Will sell my Car next year  get new ICE with 5 years warranty. Just nice 2029 will get EV. Hopefully will have much much more EV options and more charging ports as promised,btohqsg
Pfft  my car was 44bhp and no one complained back then,btohqsg
What I cannot accept is  BNB EVs are categorised largely as Cat B,btohqsg
And well  all new stuff in the market are always position as a premium,btohqsg
It’s just modern battery and motor technology that has improved overall for the auto industry.,btohqsg
I believe policy will change. If they are sincere about having full EV then I think we will see more cars in CAT A,btohqsg
The criteria should be updated for sure.,btohqsg
Totally don’t make sense to have Ioniq 5  ID4  EV6 which are clearly mass market,btohqsg
To be categorised as Cat B.,btohqsg
We need more econobox electric cars  not tesla with sports car horsepower.,btohqsg
Honda E for a family isn’t very practical if that’s what you are referring to,btohqsg
It’s too small alr. Minimally a Model 3 size.,btohqsg
Yes  but we need more of these things to have mass market adoption.,btohqsg
There’s alr the Kona EV long range alr. Which in fact  the range is the one that’s making it less attractive.,btohqsg
All those Cat A meets the size and practicality but loses out on range.,btohqsg
I cannot imagine for those who use for long distances get by with a 30+kWH battery.,btohqsg
Yes ev is different as small power means small battery haha,btohqsg
Ya we just need to have a nice balance.,btohqsg
The cat a and b model is outdated,btohqsg
Totally. Using ICE criteria to categorise EVs,btohqsg
Battery got difference   nca and lfp,btohqsg
Nca is much more expensive due to a lot of nickal that cost alot,btohqsg
These can be updated criteria yes.,btohqsg
Challenge of ev is u can’t be cheap with good battery,btohqsg
Not like ice small cc can move ok already,btohqsg
But tech will improve so maybe is possible. Haha. We won’t know,btohqsg
And battery technology China is like 2nd to none,btohqsg
What we know is that currently EV ownership is not that attractive for new car buyers.,btohqsg
So u will see China brand dominating,btohqsg
Byd blade battery technology is no joke,btohqsg
And they had overtake Mercedes’ and bmw in market cap alredyy,btohqsg
Of coz I think paying a fair price for good tech is ok. But most of the decent EVs really too far from the ICE equivalent alr,btohqsg
Until it is in parity  otherwise not attractive,btohqsg
Yes but the whole world not giving us an option hehe,btohqsg
Byd so far is the only brand with low cost and good range,btohqsg
As they are leader in ev battery,btohqsg
Any opinion if I should get vezel or Yaris hybrid. Both around 110-120k,btohqsg
I sat in Yaris and vezel before,btohqsg
Vezel feel like the car is gonna flip over   noisy and light when doing corner,btohqsg
Yaris is a saloon car. Vezel is taller suv,btohqsg
Ya but vezel feel so unstable haha,btohqsg
Get Mazda la. Value for money,btohqsg
I test drove it. I didn’t like it. Felt very tin can.,btohqsg
I everytime take grab see is vezel i ask then drive slower,btohqsg
It isn’t selling too well honestly.,btohqsg
Beautiful. Drives well. Complete car you’ll feel,btohqsg
That’s hardly a criteria. Do you buy a Car based on their sales number? Don’t. Decide for yourself that it’s a good car therefore you buy. Don’t follow masses,btohqsg
Yaris cross. Sorry I wasn’t clear,btohqsg
Looking for suv or compact suv,btohqsg
Get Mazda. Cx30. You won’t regret.,btohqsg
I think is quite small right.,btohqsg
Go check it out in showroom. Stylish abs nice. Expensive interior.,btohqsg
I enjoy my Mazda more than my bmw,btohqsg
Got other options like Citroen C4. But I heard quite unreliable,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Will shop around. Waiting for the COE to drop more (hopefully),btohqsg
Next month mass mg in cat a,btohqsg
Go with an open mind. You’ll be good. Do not pre judge,btohqsg
Actuallt no  I did test drive it. I didn’t like it. :(,btohqsg
If u want big  go cx5,btohqsg
Very tin can and it was selling at 93 999,btohqsg
But yaDerrick Chanjust test drive for yourself first.,btohqsg
Mazda crash testing even higher than volvo,btohqsg
My Mazda feels solid. Euro feel. Suspension doors body all form,btohqsg
In the past yeah. Today most brands equal if not better,btohqsg
But volvo is terrible at fuel economy. I rented a v70 wagon. It’s horrible fuel consumption.,btohqsg
Shd make a top earning salesman,btohqsg
Salesperson of Porsche told me the porche gt4 rs can be had for 630k to take delivery in 2 years time,btohqsg
Much expensive if it is cat b. Haha,btohqsg
If u want space  go for cx5. If u want newer technology  go for cx30,btohqsg
It’s true la. Coming from one who drives continentals for more than ten years saying good things about Mazda must be credible,btohqsg
I ain’t biased. Mazda definitely is better than Toyota.,btohqsg
I know  I’m in cx8 group  and a lot of the drivers are ex continental car owners,btohqsg
Cool. It’s no wonder why it’s called the Japanese bmw  with higher reliability.,btohqsg
Their pricing is lower and make it more vfm for the features it has over others,btohqsg
Yes. Solid product. The start stop is miles better than bmw start stop,btohqsg
And it comes with signal lights,btohqsg
I love my Mazda. I don’t love my bmws so much.,btohqsg
To many  owning a continental is a status,btohqsg
But car is a depreciating asset…,btohqsg
So pick the most vfm that ur wallet can stomach,btohqsg
Best is buy those cars don’t require even to loan   to excerise fianance prudent to save for rainy days,btohqsg
whats the range of blueSG btw? 😂,btohqsg
The very reason why I buy an old ar.,btohqsg
I advised a friend to buy a used car. Then he replied to me why buy old cars when there are issues. I just laughed. Shows he is ignorant. He thinks people sell cars because there are problems.,btohqsg
They are like me   don’t know how to handle old cars,btohqsg
I told him I buy food used cars. Let the suckers who buy new cars lose the most first.,btohqsg
Just want a worry free drive,btohqsg
People who have no experience buying used cars,btohqsg
That why I love tesla hehe,btohqsg
After losing a lot of money buying new cars I learned to be savvy and no more new cars. The first used car is the e30 and I’m still using it today,btohqsg
Yup like you can get a 740 at 22 k depreciation for a 6 years old car,btohqsg
But u need to know how to take care,btohqsg
This is a bit naive. A good used car is like a new one. Like my current Mazda. As good as new. But at significant discount,btohqsg
It not naive is cause u are good with cars   not every 1 is like toy,btohqsg
U need knowledge and connection to buy good 2nd hand car,btohqsg
Is true. For every good second hand deal  there are many cases of first time car buyer who got scam or bought a second hand car that gives them more problem,btohqsg
I bought a second hand merc  4 years old n the engine died on me 5 months later. Luckily I got 6 months engine warranty from car dealer if not the repair cost is 9k,btohqsg
Yes u need a trusted work shop   car knowledge and a trusted 2nd hand car dealer,btohqsg
Now I only buy new or 1 year old car with agent warranty. I’m the sucker for the rest. Haha.,btohqsg
Not really. I decided to buy a used car because I’m fed up losing so much buying new. I figure that I buy a good used car is good enough. Then I learned along the way,btohqsg
My first purchase of a used car is the very old BMW e30. Bold step,btohqsg
And That is the first BMW I own,btohqsg
It’s called taking the plunge. 😂,btohqsg
Ya. I agree with u. I wish I am more knowledgeable with car. So either I get newer car or pay more to get car from trusted dealers. My current Audi A3 was a second hand car with agent warranty.,btohqsg
I also don’t dare to buy old car… cuz inexperienced in tt. And I prefer new car smell,btohqsg
But I will buy showroom car or demo car. Get some discount off  and still getting full 10 yrs coe. And warranty,btohqsg
No right or wrong. Cause is individual money. We all have different priorities. Haha,btohqsg
Yes i totally understand this   buy a lemon car is sleep sofa daily   kids and wife will killYou,btohqsg
actually if you can just get rid of the A3 once your warranty is up,btohqsg
Better and most optimal when your depre is relatively flat,btohqsg
every month my car always have small stuff keeps breaking LOL,btohqsg
My car is priceless now. WIll keep and see how she will witness the EV revolution,btohqsg
Yup. That’s what I am intending to do. Warranty is 5 years. Still have 2 more years. Will change car before it ends,btohqsg
Some time repair cost more then change car,btohqsg
Somehow I start to think new cars wont last longer than 10 years at this rate.,btohqsg
I learn it the hard way,btohqsg
Depent what car and how much is the overhaul   some time u change car is cheaper haha,btohqsg
New cars alot of of electronics failure,btohqsg
Last time I got a car radiators down repair need 6 k and other problem workshop tell me change car to save money,btohqsg
Oh shit I remembered her birthday wrongly. She is so going to be mad at me.28 June she will be 51.,btohqsg

I’m going to restore body de rust in Jb.,btohqsg
The floor panels definitely are rusty,btohqsg
Ouch. C panel cut and weld. Hate this.,btohqsg
No clean replacement. Need to cut,btohqsg
No problem lah… the owner got $,btohqsg
bang from behind due to other people or reverse? Tesla should hhave a lot of warning system to prevent this mah,btohqsg
Haha. Like it should drive itself,btohqsg
This X is how much now?,btohqsg
There is a second hand selling 499k now,btohqsg
Hello. I ain’t for sale. I cannot be bought.,btohqsg
Senai airport city. You can buy this chocolate here. Produced in Malaysia,btohqsg
If he wants to seekMazda advice. 😂,btohqsg
How to get rid of seat mold ?I diy with steam cleaner   not working.The smell come back after few hour .I bake car under hot sun   the next day the smell come back.Any solution?,btohqsg
This will not work.Mold will come back.,btohqsg
My previous car  I accidentally left minced pork in the boot,btohqsg
Two three days later  then realized and the boot smell like dead corpse.,btohqsg
Used a lot of vinegar  then managed to get rid of the smell…,btohqsg
After tt  I get rid of the car… secret of second hand car,btohqsg
Whole car smell of vinegar ??As bad as mold ?,btohqsg
That one will go away after a while,btohqsg
Ok I give it a try.Thanks,btohqsg
For mold  they also suggest to use vinegar,btohqsg
And I always put a dehumidifier in the car  especially these days rain can be quite unpredictable,btohqsg
Those $2 type ?I put already,btohqsg
Send one time for car cleaning  that does deodorization,btohqsg
then change car. you get new seats.,btohqsg
Anyone knows what is this about?,btohqsg
ya got some random private car rentals also,btohqsg

The road hogger   road hogging is actually a very inconsiderate act   and jam the traffic   forcing lots of car to slow down and have to over take from the left . The chain effect and is actually very severe,btohqsg

Some time driving slowly does not mean it is safe,btohqsg
you all can see there is actually alot of accident due to road hogging  then the impatient driver behind will over take from the left  and lead to accident  and some times is fatal,btohqsg

many years ago i was pulled over by a cop along ECP toward changi airport. we had a nice chat for nearly 20 minutes. at that time i was driving Alfa. he admired Alfa because he himself is also driving one privately. Then he says sinkies are most hoggers (dont shoot me here). they think just because they are doing 100 they can occupy the fast lane and refused to switch to slow lane. he also says Malaysian drivers have better etiquettes that do not hog fast lanes as much.Personally I agree with him.,btohqsg
did you notice - in germany  drivers can drive so fast like past 250 even with cars on the slow lane? because the fast lane is almost always clear. once a driver sees fast car approaching he would switch to the slow lane. or once a fast car passes after using the fast lane  he switches to the slow lane to stay in that one.,btohqsg
"you wont see ""slow"" cars use the fast lane even though he maybe doing 230 or more",btohqsg
So he pull u over is to give a ticket?,btohqsg
yeah i was going fast. but i explained to him i was in a hurry to airport and so he let me off.,btohqsg
he told me if got caught best to show air ticket,btohqsg
but we chat longer becuse we like alfas. haha,btohqsg
At Malaysia  of. Course no body dares to hog fast lane 😂Oil tanking coming behind at 160km/h.. on fast laneUnless you wanna be roti prata. Then you hog😂😂😂,btohqsg
NO. that is not true at all,btohqsg
NO turcks in malaysia go at that kind of speeds,btohqsg
U were in a hurry and he let u off? (1) …. U in a hurry and still can hat for 20 mins? (2)??,btohqsg
the only worry in malaysia is you cannot drive FAST at 160 with trucks or buses on the the SLOW lane because you never know when they would suddenly come out. that is the danger,btohqsg
yes we chat on private topics on cars hogging speeding etc,btohqsg
this is long ago more than 10 years ago,btohqsg
i alwasy drive on second link to malaysdia,btohqsg
no trucks would charge you at 160.,btohqsg

you are exaggerating la. i have been driving to malaysia often,btohqsg

We need lta to educate on road hogging,btohqsg
I think now LTA need to educate Cyclist on da road,btohqsg
What do they need to educate them on? All I know is that they're not supposed to cycle more than 5 in a flight  max 2 flights per group.,btohqsg
Taking up one whole lane including bus lane blocking traffic. Especially at specific times.,btohqsg
Maybe it depends on the education and consideration of the cyclist... unless LTA enforces  how to educate?,btohqsg

We don't have a fast lane actually. Lane 1 is an overtaking lane yet some people slower than lane 2 😞,btohqsg
If u everyday kena Lane 1 slower than Lane 2 sth is wrong. At times lane 2 will be faster than 1 while vice versa. Just the time u on the road =D,btohqsg
I always take lane 5  fastest lane on mce,btohqsg
The so called slowest lane u mean? Hahahaha Maybe no cars lah thats why? LOL,btohqsg
oof. you know cycling at the edge is actually very dangerous  road bike thin wheels may trap in the grating.. or if the vehicle moves toward u   you have no more place to shift,btohqsg
Can cycle on paths instead of road. Too many Furious and dangerous stuns. I know there are drops and all uneven edge but ... Hais dk how to say lah.,btohqsg
these cyclists can be considered inconsiderate   but riding in the left most lane is not flouting any rules   i supposed.,btohqsg
heck  i dont like the roadies riding thru the yishun damn road on a busy sunday evening.. but still its their right.,btohqsg
Nope its not unless they cycle abreast (If thats the term of 2 cyclist cycling side by side) And its only a 2 lane lanes. Anyway there should be time that they arnt allowed on roads lah. Good to deter accidents or road rage where most motorist are on the road. Very grey but something has to be done at least. Especially those wearing Pro cyclist wear thinks they are GODs.,btohqsg
those wearing pro cyclists stuffs aint god even if they are slow. they are just richer than you.,btohqsg
This is fast lane. Lane 1,btohqsg
Sad to know i am poor. thanks for reminder now i know rich can do these stuff,btohqsg
Feel like driving in left hand drive country,btohqsg
Yes but lane 5 is empty most of the time   u see lane 1 driving at 80 lane 5 at 90,btohqsg
The Camara won’t go off even u drive at 90 but driver will reduce to 70 plus near the Camara,btohqsg
Hmmm... MCE only one stretch is 70 the rest 90 no issue ma,btohqsg
Yet many vans and sometimes even big trucks can be found on lane 1,btohqsg
I drive 90From kpe to mce only kpe got a stretch u can’t drive above 80 when the sing board put 70,btohqsg
The other Camara if indicate 80 u drive at 90 also no issue,btohqsg
U can observe some car just past the Camara or after Camara then go 100 plus,btohqsg
The Camara also won’t be activated,btohqsg
I see alot of Van/Lorry going Faster than that LOL,btohqsg
that's depends on your rims size difference from the stock setting,btohqsg
I see a lot especially night taking grab after drinking   I observe them Thier speed and slowly learn the trick hehe,btohqsg
but definitely not testing the limits of speed cams LOL once shot GG,btohqsg
Then u see a hogger at lane 1 at speed 80 same speed as middle lane   then ppl over take him and brake in his face,btohqsg
He still don’t want to move,btohqsg
Dun road rage can le very dangerous HAHA,btohqsg
I notice some wanted to move but the speed is same as lane 2 so instead of speeding up to change lane   they slow down to 70 and below to change lane,btohqsg
I see ppl doing this every day haha,btohqsg
I dun like MCE gg towards Pasir Ris side. At around 6-7pm the cars dun move de can stopped in tunnel. Everyone anyhow swope lanes lol,btohqsg
Ideal way of changing lane is having a faster speed,btohqsg
Is safer that way also   but most practice using slower speed to merge to faster lane,btohqsg
80 you lucky already...the hoggers mostly 60+ on lane 1 and don't want to give way either,btohqsg
A lot la haha too entitled and inconsiderate driver,btohqsg
Or those super aggressive type   but I prefer aggressive driver over road hogger,btohqsg
At least they don’t block me,btohqsg
Have encountered some aggressive ones that slide in ahead of you but don't inconvenience anyone. They match your speed so well you don't have to brake.,btohqsg
If you hog roads in Germany or other countries you would be labeled a pariah and they’ll attack you.,btohqsg
Or if you ever flash your headlamps same treatment too. In Germany when a faster car approaches the car you’re no matter how fast you do even at 250 must give way. It’s courtesy.,btohqsg
Because the fast lane is simply for overtaking only.,btohqsg
What we lack is courtesy and road manners or mindfulness.,btohqsg
Just because you do 110 doesn’t mean you’re fast and can hog,btohqsg
It's the entitlement and the kiasu-ness. Some will even brake when you want them to give way despite them not overtaking anyone. Commercial vehicles also have this weird habit of turning right from the right most lane then filtering left immediately after  and they don't notice they are causing jams by doing so. To be be clear they turned fully within their lane so there is no need to turn across lanes by taking the other one. This is when there are 2 right turn lanes and they are exiting left immediately at the next junction 200m ahead,btohqsg
Yeah entitlement. Sick really. It’s the kind of mentality of buffet. Paid and this must take as much as you can even though can’t finish,btohqsg
110 is u are lucky   so many below 90 lol,btohqsg
Watch from 12:00 onward. See how he drives fast without worrying. And other drivers how they behave,btohqsg
Overtaking confidently at 270 with slower cars on slow lane. This you must not do in Malaysia. Super dangerous. I got into a 140 kmh accident along NS highway back in 2002. Sudenly a bus comes out from slow lane without ever signaling. Braked hard Alfa and still the bus bumper swiped my front fender.,btohqsg
What u mean why i can do 90,btohqsg
I dint raise it lah LOL. Everyone is moving faster than 80 also lea.,btohqsg
Everyone doing it doesn’t mean it’s legal … but I doubt it’s everyone because I see road hogs going 70 on lane 1,btohqsg
The Camara wont go off at 90   u never notice that ppl driving way faster then you pass the Camara ?,btohqsg
Not talking about the camera 😂,btohqsg
i see but LTA say before they allow +10 wor. If not as long we above 80kmh the camera will snap already ma,btohqsg
Are you those that see 80 and drive 80 at lane 1  and form a long q behind you ?,btohqsg
I dk how the camera works though ><,btohqsg
My ODO spoil thats why HAHA i think,btohqsg
I mentioned road hogs😏 so I doubt I am one,btohqsg
I agreed. I drove last weekend. Guess what  a Toyota was hogging on the 1st lane at 80km/h and even my beetle is catching up.Signal right and the toyota ignored. What a prick.,btohqsg
I think not everyone knows abt the signal right thing,btohqsg
"Then if lane 1 u drive at say 100  the other 2 lanes are also congested  yet the car behinds insist you to let it go ahead by tailing you?""",btohqsg
Tons of such I show u all what I saw 70 plus km at lane 1,btohqsg
If u are driving at 100 I confirm u can change to 2nd lane easily,btohqsg
This one upslope I can forgive la.,btohqsg
I drive 90 as well  near camera  drive 85.,btohqsg
Near 70km/h limit camera  I drive 75,btohqsg
So question  if I drive 90km/h on mce first lane  and there is another car that is driving faster than me from behind… am I considered hogging,btohqsg
As long u dun allow them to pass u are considered Hogging,btohqsg
lane 1 is for overtaking not for keeping to speed limit,btohqsg
I let them pass me when I’m nearer to the camera,btohqsg
The kind that give way only at camera zone,btohqsg
Say say only lah… always want to do that  but don’t dare to … later estimate wrongly  I kenna camera myself,btohqsg
Just let them pass. TP always around HAHA no camera also no issue =D,btohqsg
It’s not about letting them pass or not… some of them tailgate u like almost want to kiss ur boot when u are already driving like 100kmh,btohqsg
If the follow but not at tailgate will u make way?,btohqsg
Especially if u know they slowed down because u r there?,btohqsg
They just want to pass u. Just let them pass.,btohqsg
Let them pass la... If I travel at 80 on kpe or MCE...I am lane 3/4,btohqsg
Just give way lor. In msia  everyone very auto one lane one see faster cars coming auto give way one but in sg ppl see faster car coming always like to test brakes 🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
In msia...even lane 1 140 you see a perodua coming up  also just give way. Don't understand what's so hard to just move left. Very inconsiderate mentality here among the hoggers,btohqsg
and I really hate cars then cut into the lane when I am just keeping more safety distance in front. 😡My car still have disc brakes  most ecnobox classic cars have drums all around and they aren't as effective in stopping.,btohqsg
They dun care lah. U rear them u 99% lose liao HAHA,btohqsg
yea bo bian  that is the truth. when they cut in  I slow down lor,btohqsg
Keep 2 car not 1 car length i think good enough to anticipate such people cutting in especially no signal can still fight abit. Yupps,btohqsg
Then u will get overtaken by a lot more cars,btohqsg
Guys  end of day i guess it’s all down to giving way. I always give way no matter what  cuz i know the good karma will benefit me one day when i need it.,btohqsg
Tbh most are nice and will give way only a few,btohqsg
Safety is more impt. Really buay gian these cutting but what irritating is no signal come in like a boss. HAHAHA,btohqsg
I most buay gian when some cars just stick very close to the line  trying to cut  without signalling,btohqsg
Dunno is it their habit to drive near the edge  or are they planning to cut,btohqsg
Got once at PLUS a sg plate Merc e class was hogging lane 1 at 90  behind have 4 msia cars and 2 sg cars all stuck. Either act blur or cannot hear the horn. Eventually the perodua  ya it's somehow always them  cut him when there was a short gap,btohqsg
just give way lor doesnt kill tbh i always just give way nia,btohqsg
U mean eating lanes? Yah some dk what they doing eat lanes de lol,btohqsg
I know they want to cut lanes… but they don’t want to signal… so I won’t give way… until they lan lan have to show their signal,btohqsg
Dun get used to it bah. Will become a habit.,btohqsg
It already become my habit not to give way to them,btohqsg
Most drivers who saw my car is usually nice la.Only that those very opportunists ones will cut here and there whenever there is a chance to squeeze. And their indicators don't work 100% of the time.,btohqsg
But if they signal  I will give way,btohqsg
Maybe they see car made de lo. LOL.,btohqsg
Same if they signal and come nicely I sure give way  it's those that drive beside you  knowing the lane about to close and force their way in then dulan,btohqsg
They hope u all rear them can claim,btohqsg
Ur car too Low lah they can’t see 😝,btohqsg
Hahahahaha maybe lol. If not they only want other see their car,btohqsg
Told u dun buy Lambo alr,btohqsg
Can’t even afford the coe 1,btohqsg
but but  you are not supposed to be on the fast lane 1 in the first place. 50 year old cannot... 😃,btohqsg
i am curious. how do you maintain a 50 year old car? are you still able to find parts easily?,btohqsg
has anyone of you had license suspended?>,btohqsg
Oil change is easy. Parts still have since there were 23 million classic beetles made from late 40s to '03. Many aftermarket parts support too.But being old  things breaks here and there. Since some part should be original from factory that degraded due to wear and tear.,btohqsg
sounds like my e30. so unloved i got to do it myself,btohqsg
oil change  water pump change  cam cover cleanup. intake etc. few mechanics wants to do. but i kinda enjoy doing it too,btohqsg
as e30 is a cult car  parts are available worldwide. any are die hards,btohqsg
the ony parts not easily available are the body parts - bumpers  wheel arch  front valence etc,btohqsg
but i get asked frequently at tuas customs. they are all curious how such old cars are still drivable... 😃,btohqsg
Mazda getting more premium now. The inside quality is quite European,btohqsg
They need to improve on suspension,btohqsg
And improve more on the insulation,btohqsg
The reason why I bought beetle is that I know there is a specialist workshop only for these air cooled icons.,btohqsg
just renewed my roadtax for e30.  515$ 6 months,btohqsg

Many years ago we drove in a group to Malaysia. Before coming back to Singapore we all stopped in Petronas to refuel. But one guy stood there waiting for us. He didn’t want to refuel abs I asked him why. He said malaysia fuel ain’t clean and contaminated. We all couldn’t stop laughing. Do not let the Malaysians laugh at such behavior that we dare not drive ev to Malaysia. It’s naive thinking. Please consider taking back that question.,btohqsg
While we can remain cautious  becoming overly cautious only makes us look comical and they laugh. Do not be a laughing stock for others.,btohqsg
Actually it's because of knowing where to go when there's a need to repair  that's what would greatly influence me to buy a particular model.,btohqsg

Block a good number of cars for some time,btohqsg

“Only”? I can’t afford A class,btohqsg
The best way is drive as carefully as possible   then upload the video to shame him and sent to tp for dangerous driving   if road conditions allow   will see if can just overtake him as his car is slow and give him some emotional damage   then he will drive very fast and again upload video again and sent to tp again,btohqsg
You got a better car. Mazda. Way better than A class. This is entry level car that is for people who want the brand,btohqsg
best punishment for him is to let tp charge  him  and remind him that his car is very slow  and give him empotional damage,btohqsg
the toyota is a nice guy  but some 1 did the job for him,btohqsg
does not matter faster will do,btohqsg
I think A180 is faster than my mazda,btohqsg
I normally would give way to faster car on the fast lane when I sense he’s polite. But if the guy tailgates me real close without patience then I won’t give in. I’ll brake to make him jolt.,btohqsg
the only thing matter is actually whose car accelerate faster,btohqsg
then can make the other party rage,btohqsg
I’ve met a few Maseratis before on NS highways. They’re very polite. They don’t flash lights. And stay far away. I can see them faster than me and I’ll switch lane to let them pass,btohqsg
i met a few coe type in the east,btohqsg
car is loud driving agressivelly but is slow,btohqsg
Don’t laugh. It’s true. For small class car Mercedes is just budget made,btohqsg
some get emotional damage  and drive very fast  and i just summit as reckless driving,btohqsg
I know… same applies for bmw,btohqsg
They enter the budget market.. and spoil the brand,btohqsg
Surprisingly true… even the lambosand Ferraris on the expressway… they are quite ok,btohqsg
Humble pax different they are rare breeds Mclarens as well,btohqsg
Yes. Correct. Like the B class. Just to compete with others. 3 cylinder tech can’t even measure against Toyota,btohqsg
The proper is one like 3 5 6 7,btohqsg
Rear wheel drive where they don’t cut corners,btohqsg
When I drive the m3 those who play with me are the Lexus. Others like bmw would stay far not near me.,btohqsg
Even Mercedes also likes to play. They’re like that. Quite annoying.,btohqsg
just wondering  how would someone indicate they want you to give way without getting close to you or flashing? if i see someone far away  i assume they dont intend to overtake,btohqsg
There are some that come so close  that put u at risk of having an accident,btohqsg
[Sneak preview of our next giveaway👀]Guess what the 6th item you would need for your trip to Malaysia is🤔Hint: Sold out at most places🏪⛽️➡️ The 3 top most engaging members will also be walking away with this mystery prize!🎉🎁,btohqsg
you are supposed to be on the lookout of faster vechicles in the fast lane if you continue to use the fast lane.,btohqsg
you cannot assume that just because he is far away and thus you occupy the fast lane. you are supposed to moved to the slower lane. that is courtesy,btohqsg
oh no la  wont risk a frontal collision just to get people to move,btohqsg
Do u see it in SG context? No.,btohqsg
yeah la. sigkies are like that they feel entitled that they hog the fast lane. ,btohqsg
unfortunately many people do not notice behind them  when i am on lane 1 i am constantly looking at rear view mirror. many drivers cruise on lane 1 in their own world  some even better using mounted mobile device,btohqsg
Not all drivers are zai… some panick when they see a car so near their backside…,btohqsg
And the definition of near for everyone is different,btohqsg
you are suppose to check your rear view mirror very 5 seconds. If you see that the car behind is getting bigger in your mirror  what does that tell you?,btohqsg
in germany  i was in a car with my friend. he';s driving at 220~ and but he is always on the lookout for faster cars. he would stay on the slower lane even though he is doing fast. if he continues on the fast lane  be alert  faster car clsing in and he gives ways,btohqsg
They are on the same way as me,btohqsg
you are doing right. many lack this courtesy and education.,btohqsg
are they in the same rightmost lane as you?,btohqsg
what do you mean? as long as you see car behind you in the fast lane  switch over to let them pass. this is the way.,btohqsg
@ic3l3mont3a@lawryyyywe will reveal it next week👀,btohqsg
fast lane means you can never know othes can be faster than you.  and it is really meant for ovrtaking,btohqsg
No lah… usually all lanes are full,btohqsg
And I’m on the fast lane to rush back home myself,btohqsg
Always rush to pick kids  rush to go back to do work,btohqsg
the rule is: switch to slow lane aftwr using fast lane when possible. you are deemed hogging the road if the slow lane is available for you,btohqsg
And the slow lane is too slow for my speed,btohqsg
that's just the best case scenario,btohqsg
when in jam.. all lanes are slow,btohqsg
Mine is a slow baby elephant,btohqsg
What is the most vfm car to buy now,btohqsg
actually if not for hoggers expressways wont really jam  next time jam take a look  somewhere far down the line you will see a car with no one infront and easily 10+ vehicles sticking close. can even see some constantly moving left and right to check if can overtake or not,btohqsg
I see Mitsubishi Outlander only 139k,btohqsg
Whoa i see only XXXk i fainted. LOL,btohqsg
then what is your concern? since you cannot speed up. the behind guy just have to suck thumb cos u are not the one hogging,btohqsg
Speeding up may cost u ur Points hahaa. If u exceeed alot just to move away,btohqsg
When coe was 46k  outlander was 115k,btohqsg
Whoa means back in my time. Outlander maybe less than 100k,btohqsg
if you got follow his post  you know those points you raised are not valid,btohqsg
you want to try to scroll up and read?,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/s2CDVUu1KbAsomeday i will modify my mazda this way,btohqsg
What are the things u mod for ur mazda,btohqsg
i hardly modify cars. i like originalbest. the only things i have done in the past is stiffer suspension and larger sway bars.,btohqsg
i am GT driver. i enjoy driving what comes with the car. i dont squat down to check rims fog lamps led lamps etc,btohqsg
my mazda and bmws are all original,btohqsg
ok for wheels i use BBS. made for bmw. 3 piece BBS RS3 wheels,btohqsg
maybe one day i electrify the e30,btohqsg
what did you do to your mazda? for me  nothing. all factory standard.,btohqsg
car is already good and complete. nothing else need to be changed,btohqsg
Just need to wait for the next cx60  cx80,btohqsg
how long have you had the mazda?,btohqsg
are you a convert form bmw,btohqsg
the one i like to experiment is the e30. t is like a project car for me. i swapped z3 shifter with short throw. 325 rear brake discs (original is drum) costs me rm700.,btohqsg
i am tired of drum brake leaks and wear,btohqsg
nice. i only owned in in january first mazda,btohqsg
@SGCM_AdminI am quite tired of bad driving habit videos.Can you guys please feature this as a good driving habit in SG?https://www.facebook.com/groups/487930318274402/permalink/1611321892601900/,btohqsg
yes this is very good  i also say thanks like that when people give way,btohqsg
This is practiced in Japan as part of their driving courtesy. It is nice to have it here.,btohqsg
Sure  we will feature some good driving habits in SG😊 Thanks for your suggestion!,btohqsg
Yup  but sadly not many people are aware of this practice😪,btohqsg
all this comes with a lot of driving experience which many dont have,btohqsg
in malaysia  trucks or buses would signal to you to ovwrtake when it is safe. and you honk in return to say thank you.,btohqsg
thats because saying thanks starts with the front person giving way  and thats where the problem lies 😏,btohqsg
I will sure share once it is online. 😁,btohqsg
It is also the unspoken rule on signal to the right on lane 1 to ask politely for car in front to give way to you.I learnt this when I was driving in MY.,btohqsg
