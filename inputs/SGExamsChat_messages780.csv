That friend choose to take the math major ones  which is the hardest one,btohqsg
Gotta love the mall under construction,btohqsg
Well that friend thought that... Well nothing bad is going to happen if I took that module by the math department,btohqsg
Oh so cannot use as the core u mean,btohqsg
NTU be like: what is SU?,btohqsg
think they building crl plus new bus int there,btohqsg
wtf i was js there js now,btohqsg
I think calculus is a core for econs major,btohqsg
But you can choose to take that module from the math dept or the econs dept,btohqsg
üíÄ im on the mrt lol,btohqsg
There are people who actually double major in math and econs,btohqsg
they say is gonna open soon  doesn't look like is ready for opening,btohqsg
Its just that the friend of mine took the one offered by the math dept,btohqsg
And got massacred by the module,btohqsg
i alr know a few ppl in my batch double major math & econs,btohqsg
Lmfao  it never does...wait until I army come out still won't be done wanna bet,btohqsg
Crl will be way later than 2030,btohqsg
Its a common double major for math students tbh,btohqsg
I realised physics is also applied english,btohqsg
The explanation qns was killing me in sec sch,btohqsg
tbh it‚Äôs common for ppl to take econs with smth else lol,btohqsg
Ah ic so the calculus fr the math dpt turns out to be more chim?,btohqsg
I know one of my friends took stats and econs as well,btohqsg
ntu econs batch only 58% is pure econs and that‚Äôs not counting those with second major in biz,btohqsg
I can get why calculus is a core for econs,btohqsg
The math department also offered game theory,btohqsg
But that game theory is a super duper abstract module,btohqsg
I know math + econs is p common,btohqsg
ntu math even got mods like financial econometrics lol,btohqsg
I cant imagine the game theory in h3,btohqsg
I never took before but from the prerequisites  it is actually more of an OR,btohqsg
Coz my econs intro  game theory just a small bit,btohqsg
bus int has been under upgrading since 2021 iirc,btohqsg
Wdym just sign up through their form,btohqsg
No wonder your profile name is musician,btohqsg
Used to do grading but then i stopped coz i cant do a diploma in that + uni at the same time,btohqsg
But I didn't take any exams like ABRSM before,btohqsg
So I have never experienced what it is like to be graded,btohqsg
Tbh i realised learning in yamaha has higher passing rate then learning in cc,btohqsg
No point taking the exams ngl,btohqsg
Plus there are like way more freedom in learning the things I want to learn,btohqsg
but didn't take exams  cuz i quit,btohqsg
So i did all the way fr cc until g7 (electone counts fr 13 downwards) and i failed g7 twice under cc tutelage  then transferred to yamaha and then managed to seek approval to skip g7 and then passed g6 w 1y crash course,btohqsg
Its way more fun that way,btohqsg
But for me i find the gg for exam pushing me to practice etc,btohqsg
Okay what piece do you want to learn?,btohqsg
And then I go and search for the music that I want to learn,btohqsg
And then she's like... This is difficult for you but I think you can play it,btohqsg
i wna learn piano again  but no motivation,btohqsg
If not  its more of my teacher finding some recommendations for me to learn,btohqsg
Mainly because you are only looking at this through a lens of cost.,btohqsg
but dk how the cohort did tho,btohqsg
Hopefully this can pull me up to A-?,btohqsg
wtf since when poa so hard,btohqsg
Should be la cuz I got like 26,btohqsg
From reddit poll looks like median is so far hovering around 30,btohqsg
1. Poster (25%) - From the comments  seems like B+2. Class part (10%) - Probably towards the upper end of moderate3. Panel (30%) - B-4. Physical Test (30%) - 38/405. Online lectures (5%) - Done6. Feedback bonus - +3%,btohqsg
If it's 30 I think still can,btohqsg
Mine should also be around A-,btohqsg
Wait the match supp to start at,btohqsg
no now is the vjc vs sajc match,btohqsg
Pay attn to nsg announcement much,btohqsg
Only until my friends name got mentioned,btohqsg

I'm gonna go to my bed and sleep,btohqsg
I feel like Im gonna be so sad when I grad,btohqsg
yes yt i saw ur msg,btohqsg
don't think i don't know ah,btohqsg
i close one eye for now,btohqsg
"""hawker centre supoosed to be affordable""",btohqsg

And aso uni do hold exams on saturdays,btohqsg
So i hv a paper on sat 9amüíÄ,btohqsg
What major are you in btw?,btohqsg
weekends = restUni: weekends = test and exams,btohqsg
I think its okay for us students,btohqsg
But very troublesome for the staff there,btohqsg
Imagine weekend liao you want to have family time,btohqsg
Then sorry there's an exam you have to invigilate,btohqsg
That's like 5 hours gone for the Saturday,btohqsg
but i feel not okay though,btohqsg
some students want to go back and enjoy with parents,btohqsg
At least for students... The faster you clear the exams  the faster you enjoy the holidays,btohqsg
i feel so nostalgic when i see the jh ppl,btohqsg
Especially if its the last semester... You really really want to say bye to university once and for all,btohqsg
no ltr my jh teacher see i honggans,btohqsg
Of course if you are doing postgrad then different la...,btohqsg
Now the bell curve God upgrade liao,btohqsg
Now they make info a avocado,btohqsg
I‚Äôm reminded of the Mr Bean mascot though,btohqsg
Jialat need to drink Mr Bean before exams liao,btohqsg
I wonder what an avocado likes to eat? Maybe you can offer it some ammonium nitrate or sunlight,btohqsg
Dance BTS‚Äô Butter in front of the shrine ‚Äî confirm A,btohqsg
Exams will be Smooth Like Butter,btohqsg
Actually after a while I get super sian of eating ËÄÅ‰º¥,btohqsg
The first few times still not so bad,btohqsg
i am like so addicted to this drink,btohqsg
Then after a while eat until sian liao,btohqsg
oh u eat the soybean ah,btohqsg
Drink I actually prefer grass jelly to soybean,btohqsg
So I don't go ËÄÅ‰º¥ for these two drinks,btohqsg
no lag i make joke only,btohqsg
Not in country for quite a long while didn't really explore around once I'm back,btohqsg
Also there's like nothing to explore in SG,btohqsg
japan is like full of familymart,btohqsg
Once upon a time me and my gf want to go the zoo,btohqsg
Holy shit the ticket for one person is like $40+,btohqsg
In the end we settle for the aquarium at Sentosa because the aquarium is actually super good from the reviews,btohqsg
And aquarium date is romantic ngl,btohqsg
I want the last time exchange rate back,btohqsg
Its really hurting me super a lot,btohqsg
Why the fed don't cut its interest rates....,btohqsg
They are not like cutting man,btohqsg
BOJ finally raise its rates last month,btohqsg
And become the value we see today,btohqsg
Of course after that the US release its inflation data,btohqsg
maybe other factors play a role too,btohqsg
Granted  the increase is not significant enough to have any effects,btohqsg
do you think japanese are thrifty?,btohqsg
Actually Feds cutting the rates is actually the biggest effect for the exchange rates globally,btohqsg
But they are very good in squeezing it,btohqsg
ah maybe its the spending habits,btohqsg
Like making it super cost efficient,btohqsg
Like the house can be small,btohqsg
But they can really really make full use of it,btohqsg
They just spend the money very effectively,btohqsg
like they plan out budget one ah,btohqsg
And probably they can see the item they buy right,btohqsg
And then think of how to fully maximise the item,btohqsg
They are super good in terms of reducing wastage,btohqsg
ya this one i can agree,btohqsg
And buying the things they need instead of what they really want and never use it again,btohqsg
like how businesses take the 50% losses,btohqsg
instead of throwing the food away,btohqsg
Yes this one varies a lot,btohqsg
Usually Japan shops have a lot of choices,btohqsg
Like say if you buy a fan,btohqsg
But the fan comes in a lot of different shapes and sizes,btohqsg
So they will usually buy the ones that actually fit their needs,btohqsg
Japan has a massive culture of point accumulation,btohqsg
So they use that in their favour and only do the bulk grocery shopping on the given day,btohqsg
why not for one week like asian families do,btohqsg
is it because of the freshness of the ingredients?,btohqsg
one of the best sg ads ive seen,btohqsg
Ur president? He‚Äôs talking about the USA,btohqsg
That one needs to ask Powell,btohqsg
Good afternoon. My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on ourdual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people. Theeconomy has made considerable progress toward our dual mandate objectives. Inflation haseased substantially while the labor market has remained strong  and that is very good news. Butinflation is still too high  ongoing progress in bringing it down is not assured  and the pathforward is uncertain. We are fully committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.Restoring price stability is essential to achieve a sustainably strong labor market that benefits all.,btohqsg
oh nvm thought yall were talking about colin powell lol,btohqsg
but the soup was too dam salty,btohqsg
Ahh did it balance it out?,btohqsg
but too much salt oso hard to drink,btohqsg
Usually when too salty I just add water a bit,btohqsg
"big pot of meat and its ""free"" ig",btohqsg
Jerome Powell not Colin Powell lol,btohqsg
But I think if wait too long  then its going to be recession liao,btohqsg
havent kept up with these things rip,btohqsg
The beatings would continue till morale improves,btohqsg
my mind has been going crazy for the past 2 weeks,btohqsg
I feel like Van Gogh the eve of the day he cut his ears off,btohqsg
my mum said i need to stop assuming ill intent when i really need help,btohqsg
and be thick skin a bit,btohqsg
I quote my instructor from my Cultural intelligence class. Be thick skin,btohqsg
lol i need learn from my dad  the thick skin master,btohqsg
How do you get thicker skin?,btohqsg
by stepping out ur comfort zone i guess,btohqsg
I see  what you've told me is extremely important,btohqsg
Like don't be scared of failures and all,btohqsg
Like don't even take it to heart if you face rejections,btohqsg
Depends on how you do that lor,btohqsg
i had a lot of it:-(,btohqsg
Also  sometimes when you are so desperate in life,btohqsg
You probably don't care about saving the ego,btohqsg
And you just ask for help,btohqsg
Like if you don't be thick skin  you confirm will die,btohqsg
If you at least be thick skinned  you probably won't die,btohqsg
I think it really depends on the situation,btohqsg
And how desperate you are in achieving your goals,btohqsg
If you are super desperate  then probably you won't care about losing your ego,btohqsg
it is just a fear boundary,btohqsg
That's one way to look at it,btohqsg
i have lived 4y not wanting to email a prof,btohqsg
Of course things are not very fluid,btohqsg
eh me too but now i email them on a weekly basis minimally,btohqsg
Actually I need more context about what's happening,btohqsg
I feel like I should give everyone benefit of the doubt,btohqsg
lemme pm you i cant reveal more info here,btohqsg
Just accept that some people can't be reasoned with,btohqsg
benefit of the doubt is a benefit to those that have earned it,btohqsg
not just give any random person,btohqsg
Feels nice  doesn't it? If nothing matters  then all the pain and guilt you feel for making nothing of your life goes away.Sucked  Into  A bagel...,btohqsg
Is confrontation a bad thing? I feel like more and more of us are afraid of confronting others,btohqsg
We just hide between our screens and stuff,btohqsg
being afraid of confrontation is the bad thing,btohqsg
not saying to go and confront everyone but like,btohqsg
It's not confronting if they can't tell it's that,btohqsg
but at the same time  it‚Äôs not necessary to always prove you‚Äôre right to others lol if it doesn‚Äôt matter or help,btohqsg
What to do if someone avoids you when you try and confront them,btohqsg
You think because l‚Äôm kind that it means I‚Äôm naive  and maybe I am. It‚Äôs strategic and necessary. This is how I fight.,btohqsg
she on Indonesia trip but now don‚Äôt feel the same,btohqsg
I mean depending on the circumstances  the other person might need some time,btohqsg
At least you've let them know uw to confront abt it,btohqsg
then the indoneisians preach about islam,btohqsg
Just let it be for now,btohqsg
What is life if not space,btohqsg
CB cancel culture say cancel culture,btohqsg
Are we not insignificant given the sheer scale of the universe,btohqsg
the phenomenon or practice of publicly rejecting  boycotting  or ending support for particular people or groups because of their socially or morally unacceptable views or actions,btohqsg
I mean at the end of every road,btohqsg
It leds to the same thing,btohqsg
We like to believe we have control,btohqsg
well there is a different ending technically,btohqsg
What's the different ending? We all die,btohqsg
we all die in different ways,btohqsg
Guys what do I do. They don't understand my meta humor,btohqsg
anyone going to pressing ahead tomorrow,btohqsg
In the end it's still death,btohqsg

so tell me whats ur humour  tht can get u banned frm a gc,btohqsg

There was a time I was bullying like shit in secondary school,btohqsg
Probably why now all I get when someone says it is just I laugh,btohqsg

Fr I‚Äôm down a lot on my stocks  the faster the rate cut comes the better for me. Hopefully June they‚Äôll cut though given the current data most analysts think there‚Äôs less than a 50% chance it‚Äôll be coming that fast. Having at least 3 cuts would be good this year though,btohqsg
But surprisingly today the market is bullish (most stocks are rising) despite the inflation data released today,btohqsg
Over the medium-term  interest rates are likely to settle at a higher level than in the last cycle. Goldman Sachs economists have long argued that the neutral rate (at which the economy is at full employment  and the policy rate neither stimulates nor slows GDP growth) was not quite as low as the conventional wisdom held during the last cycle. For now  the short-run neutral rate might be higher than the long-run neutral rate because fiscal deficits are much wider than usual  resilient risk sentiment has limited the transmission from higher rates to broad financial conditions and the economy  and the most rate-sensitive sectors (housing and autos) have been constrained more by supply than demand. All these factors help the economy remain at full employment despite higher interest rates. Fed officials are likely to raise their estimates of the neutral rate over time  though by how much remains uncertain.,btohqsg
Yeah after the 2007/8 financial crisis the fed left the interest rates at a low level for too long,btohqsg
I think they learned their lesson,btohqsg
The beatings will continue until morale improves,btohqsg
Beatings as in high interest rates?,btohqsg
