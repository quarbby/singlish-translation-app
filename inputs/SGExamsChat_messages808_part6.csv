Japan hv a lot of hidden gems in the less-touristy areas,btohqsg
I feel like your money can be better spent somewhere else to experience another country,btohqsg
Instead of the diminishing returns of just going to Japan again and again,btohqsg
True but idk why im so in love w japan,btohqsg

The 3rd angle is a complaint by japanese that tourist are disobeying laws to get the 3rd angle,btohqsg

So basically in 1 month  japanese residence have complained to authorities on seperate occasions all concerning the view of mount fujiAnd for 3 of those complaints follow up action have been done including the erecting of barriers and demolishing of a near complete housing block,btohqsg
