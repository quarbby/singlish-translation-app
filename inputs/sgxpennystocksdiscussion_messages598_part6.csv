Pan-United and Shell sign MOU to explore decarbonisation solutions in built environmentRead:https://link.theedgesingapore.com/87ZapGckEL1e9oHM6Download our app:edgesg.link/appdl,btohqsg
It’s easier to play if you have the holding power. Trading is harder game to master as there are many other factors to look at. Investing on the other end  is boring but no stress.For this PanUnited call made almost a year back at $0.285. Currently $0.34 which equates to 15% ROI. Still pretty decent actually and it looks to be getting better with the strong share buy backs and de carbonisation efforts and collaborations they are embarking on.Hope some bought and held this one then,btohqsg

🩺Pika World Markets Insight🎙🎈Feel the pain?🔫While the Fed has not raised any interest rate  some stocks sensitive to economic development are starting to feel the pain. For example  the industrials  materials and transport sectors are among those that are affected by the prospect of a higher interest rate environment.Companies are feeling the pinch as borrowing costs is on the rise. Often known as the corporate credit spreads  investors expect more yields for owning the company’s bonds. In addition  economically sensitive stocks are highly impacted as their demand rises and falls  given their cyclical nature.In a nutshell  a higher credit spread of such cyclical firms means that investors are asking for a higher yield on the bonds due to the earnings risk.Ultimately  the outcome is mainly dependent on how fast inflation moves and whether the Fed will be aggressively hiking interest rates.💰The test of the market🔨Companies may find it more challenging to meet Wall Streets estimate. If this is true  then the bull market may have lesser fuel on the run. We are ushering in another new earnings season  starting with the big banks.So why would companies disappoint in their earnings? There is often a trend for analysts to quickly push up a company’s profit during recovery or the early expansion phase. However  as we enter the mid-cycle phase in 2022  the earnings may tend to be less impressive such that growth may start to moderate.Pika World shall dive deep into the latest earnings seasons to explore any signs of weakness  especially with the onset of Omicron.🏀Inflation is still Hot🥊The latest CPI continued to reflect a hot price market. On the bright side  it wasn't worst than anticipated and this gives a tiny comfort to the equity market. All eyes are now on the FOMC meeting next week where we will likely receive new clues on the Fed's monetary trajectory and with the earnings season coming  the market is back on a volatile mode as we had seen since mid Nov 2021.Pika World wishes everyone a prosperous trading day ahead!Pika Nat.,btohqsg
