"Singapore's GIChas never had so much money to manage — or faced more problems managing itThe sovereign wealth fund is attempting one of its biggest-ever asset pivots after finding its two main pillars — China and bonds — under siege.""Our expectation going forward is that the challenges are big and varied and there aren't a lot of historical precedents "" said chief executive officer Lim Chow Kiat  a GIC veteran of 28 years  in a rare interview. ""The last time we had a serious inflation problem I was just born.""https://bt.sg/JXKy",btohqsg

https://www.ncid.sg/Health-Professionals/Diseases-and-Conditions/Pages/Influenza.aspxInfluenza A and B virus infections occur all year round in Singapore with small peaks in the middle and the end/beginning of the year.In April 2009  an outbreak of influenza caused by a novel influenza A virus (H1N1- 2009)  was reported in Mexico. It subsequently spread to the rest of the world. Singapore reported its first case in a returning student from New York  US  on 26 May 2009. On 11 June  the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century. By September 2009  it was estimated that at least 270 000 persons had been infected in Singapore. A total of 18 H1N1-related deaths were reported during this period  representing slightly more than 1% of hospitalized cases and a case fatality rate of 6.7 per 100 000 cases. The WHO declared an end to the pandemic in August 2010.,btohqsg

"✈️Pika World Update 9 Feb 2022✈️The equity market had a strong showing despite bond yields climbing to the highest level since 2019. Investors renewed their appetite for technology names and sent a clear risk-on sentiment  at least for now.💰Larger risk premium🏋As short term interest rates rose faster and economic data remained robust  investors appeared to be demanding higher yields on longer-term bonds on the backdrop that inflation expectation for the future is high. This makes sense for a rising 10-year yield environment.Since inflation is expected to rise above 2%  bond investors typically demand a rate higher than inflation and thus  as investors  we might be bracing for 10-year treasury yield to hit above 2%.🏸What had changed?💎For one  the Fed outlook might look less frightening than one expected. A couple of weeks ago  investors were betting that the March interest rate lift-off would be 0.50%; The expectation has come down to 0.25% again.Moreover  we had seen technology stocks sold off in January and investors appear to re-balance their allocation slightly into technology. Finally  the general better than expected earnings are also lifting the sector's profit expectation  with the aggregate result for S&P 500 tech companies hitting above estimates by 8.8% thus far.Nonetheless  Pika World remains cautious as the outlook for technology stocks remain hazy. As a result  they appear to have a less firm conviction in the sector.💊Peloton: A strategic move for a brighter future🛎Wall Street rallied behind Peloton latest plan to replace its CEO and axed 2800 jobs with a move to overhaul its board. This sent the stocks up by 25% on Tuesday ever since the company introduced steps to help respond to a dramatic slowdown in sales.The steps towards improving on the operation front are welcomed by investors as there is sharper clarity overgrowth  their cost base and a determination to preserve cash.Pika World is waiting for a possible entry point.📱Nvidia: Make it happens🎉The stock had fallen hard since its 2021 high. It has dropped to a supposed ""bear market"" price. However  there appears nothing fundamentally worrying for the company other than its failed acquisition of chip designer ARM. Now the overhang is gone  it is perhaps a good time to focus on its core. It is a technology supplier to the highly acclaimed ""metaverse"" world  which is a new sales opportunity.With the company focus on encoding software into its graphics  data centre and even automotive chips  it can monetize further its prowess through increasing the prices of these chips that go into the Metaverse products. They are a node  a touchpoint  and a glow of where the world is shifting.It is likely to drive earnings growth for the years ahead. Analysts expect the sales and earnings per share to compound annually between 20% to 25%  which is a commendable rate. To push for higher EPS growth  its software business which accounts for higher margins is expected to grow. This business segment is expanding  and one can expect Nvidia's operating margin to rise to 58% by 2026 from about 47% in 2021.Pika World will be looking into slow accumulation in the stock.It is 9 Feb Wednesday  8.10 am in Singapore and 8.10 am in New York. We hope you have a splendid trading week ahead!",btohqsg
