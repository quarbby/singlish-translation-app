Good point  but some troll will keep insisting that he can get dirt cheap deals in JB,btohqsg

So you're running your x6m as a phv?,btohqsg
Or were you lying about having one in the first place?,btohqsg
I told my wife probably because ppl usually associate price with quality/class  that's why there are ppl who look down on phv/delivery guys cos they dun charge like lawyers  yet such ppl dun look at the service they provide  cos if there are no delivery or phv guys these ppl would have to haul asses to the warehouse to dig for their buys,btohqsg

I met Jovi and im still alive,btohqsg
I change car alr also haven claim,btohqsg
sure you can think whatever you like doesn't change the fact that you're wrong,btohqsg
It is not an accusation but a fact. The way type is very obvious. I applaud that you have become smarter with every version you updated to but using long sentences only fools those who are new in this group.It truly is amazing on how you are so persistent so motivated to create a new account every single time you get kicked out. I have yet to figure out on why you are so committed to be here when you are always being attacked. Is it because you are lonely? Is it because you are bored or is it because you like the attention?,btohqsg
bored already lol. can't reason with AI... or NI in this case,btohqsg
How is it harmful and inaccurate? It would be nice if you could guys us an explanation. Or are you just saying it because it helps to keep your word count up? I mean  it helped you sound smarter than your other versions but I am not convinced until you give us the explanation.,btohqsg
at least chatgpt gives me answers i want,btohqsg

BMW got style points lah but for better ease of mind  mazda is the way to go,btohqsg

Fast enough for our singapore roads  spacious and cheaper to maintain,btohqsg
cus 316 is a little bit underpowered for the chassis,btohqsg
actually  what's ur current car now,btohqsg
cus 316 u still need to tune up for more power leh i feel,btohqsg
Oh  I tht 316 and 318 is the same horse power.,btohqsg

See your priorities and budget... You need a family car just to get from point A to B  Mazda definitely.... If having a luxury brand is important  no need to think  go with BMW,btohqsg
And I wouldn’t say they’re unreliable,btohqsg
cost more to run la duh,btohqsg
But not unreliable unless you get ah beng or yp unit,btohqsg
then go claim warranty w PML,btohqsg
if you don't ignore warning messages and replace parts when you should then it definitely will be reliable,btohqsg
or dun pretend to NOT SEE Check Engine light,btohqsg
but 8 year old unit  is a coin toss,btohqsg
actually if u gna buy  usually i replace whatever needs to be replaced,btohqsg
cus i always have this word of,btohqsg

Ur pocke okay with a 3 series not okay with an a4?,btohqsg
Eh bro U dun make my toes laugh leh,btohqsg
I still like the design of bmw,btohqsg
The heart wants what it wants,btohqsg
more importantly get the wife approval,btohqsg
She both also can la. We went for test drive already.,btohqsg
whatever you choose just go do PPI,btohqsg
Wear and tear not all covered in warranty,btohqsg
That's what will cost you more compared to a Jap like Mazda 6,btohqsg
My concern is BMW will have problems down the road.,btohqsg
Just take care of the car and the car will take care of you,btohqsg
old cars all sure have problems,btohqsg
That's when the B9 came in,btohqsg
But most 2016 b9s will be at the point of requiring wear and tear work,btohqsg
Mazda 6 can be problematic also if it was in the hands of a wrong owner,btohqsg
So be prepared for that if you look at units with no maint history,btohqsg
Got people drive 6 years never change ATF,btohqsg
If toyota engine oil also can,btohqsg
But usually the seller will always require deposit before inspection right? So far I asked a few seller's they told me the same thing.,btohqsg
Can run long long no issues,btohqsg
But with bmw your benefit is that for maint history,btohqsg
But the deposit will offset from your downpayment,btohqsg
You can check in the idrive itself,btohqsg
And exactly what has been done on every service,btohqsg
If done at a specialist with the right computer or at PML,btohqsg
Maybe you should get a bmw one day,btohqsg
Seems like you have the passion for it,btohqsg
So it'll help you judge the condition better if you aren't too sure about how to check physically and during test drive,btohqsg
And then place deposit and go in for a good PPI,btohqsg
