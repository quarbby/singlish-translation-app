Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. Itâ€™s not a story the Jedi would tell you. Itâ€™s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith  so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create lifeâ€¦ He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerfulâ€¦ the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power  which eventually  of course  he did. Unfortunately  he taught his apprentice everything he knew  then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death  but not himself.,btohqsg
