Y he never park like that,btohqsg
Siao liao  New car alr like that,btohqsg
take the pressure off the tyres so it wont have bald spot,btohqsg
This one look at nippon paint poster or the car?,btohqsg
yes  after tat need go touch up  just drive up to Nippon paint can liao,btohqsg
But fn2 like not fast tho why ah,btohqsg
Uh no wonder . I was wondering why along all the R the fn2 like not here not there,btohqsg
compression not as high as K20A,btohqsg
is not a bad car  but just not as good as the FD2R,btohqsg
I think should be like the slowest type r alr if like this since the new one has turbo,btohqsg
u looking to buy type R ah bro HAHA,btohqsg
I rmb got see ppl drag race before,btohqsg
I dont think it's that slow,btohqsg
Might be faster than ep3 and ek9,btohqsg
but not as popular only lo,btohqsg
It's slowest compared to the new ones,btohqsg
2L Vtec is still 2L vtec,btohqsg
No la I dk what to change also now adays car expensive but got consider Fd2r,btohqsg
Ohhhh FD2R depre slowly falling le,btohqsg
Ya I wait fall finish then I go see hahahahaha,btohqsg
Haha what you driving now bro ?,btohqsg
then FN2R is definitely still an improvement,btohqsg
it's a good car on its own. just that people always compare it to fd2r. similar to fk2r vs fk8r.,btohqsg
think most car would be an improvement to Perodua,btohqsg
torsion beam or not  honestly unless you going track competitively  it wouldn't matter to us average drivers.,btohqsg
dont need R also improvement le,btohqsg
for us is whether we can handle the car confidently or not.,btohqsg
without jumping to type r  swift sport is good too.,btohqsg
I considering 116i I see scd got 1 very nice,btohqsg
wah if perodua to type r thats a huge jump sia,btohqsg
If Fd2r price drop maybe can consider also,btohqsg
there is 118i to consider too. basically identical but w higher power.,btohqsg
116D torque buay pai leh can consider also,btohqsg
Ya that‚Äôs why just do the m135 bodykit,btohqsg
It will only continue to go up. Won't be coming down,btohqsg
I believe it will come down though,btohqsg
Majority fd2r driver buy with high loan and expecting COE to go up,btohqsg
All the best for the waiting,btohqsg
Since when Fd2r price will drop haha,btohqsg
M3 deprec lower den fd2r.. lol really gotta be jdm fan gao gao to get it,btohqsg
but ya always will have ppl buy la,btohqsg
now minimum 17k deprec for fd2r on sgcm lol..,btohqsg
difficult to find an fd2r with less than 6 owners too,btohqsg
Cannot. Swift sport ECU very weird one,btohqsg
Some car can use OBD gauge,btohqsg
you can take and try plug in to see if yours can or not,btohqsg
If yall need to look for a trusted workshop,btohqsg
I mean if didn‚Äôt buy it‚Äôs not a loss   Fd2r depre can buy 4.2 maser or e92 m3 alr,btohqsg
Its a kind of jdm machine for people to appreciate it.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs if u buy as a second car to enjoy or collecting but most people buy as the only car and daily drive that depre can buy many other cars though and it‚Äôs not like Fkin fast kind it‚Äôs just a very good car to go on track,btohqsg
Cars like evo all these also,btohqsg
The depre can buy supercar alr,btohqsg
COE ferrari is going for 30k+ depre,btohqsg
and people are asking 40 or 50k depre for evo,btohqsg
JDM is supposed to be cheap and be as fast as European cars.,btohqsg
Exactly I don‚Äôt deny the fact evo are sick af but how many would get a evo over a Gallardo at 40k depre if it‚Äôs within their budget just like m3 vs type r,btohqsg
haha can i just add  maybe we are in the wrong place to own good cars.,btohqsg
the depre foranycar here is crazy.,btohqsg
Ya previously was like 8-10k few years back,btohqsg
dont compare prices of sg to overseas,btohqsg
If prices of a FD2R now is as expensive as an A45 AMG  makes no sense to buy one la,btohqsg
Evo 10 was also around 8k depre years back,btohqsg
now also almost 20k i think?,btohqsg
But that said  I am guilty of buying an MX-5 for the price of a BMW Z4,btohqsg
But i really wanted manual and BMW didn't offer one. I was looking at SLK and Z4 too,btohqsg
the jdm counterparts used to be more appealing because of the 2.0L. especially here in sg. now many contis also 2.0L,btohqsg
And alot of these JDMs are actually heavily marked up by dealer,btohqsg
Some dealers they even borrow their friend's car to list high price just to jack up market rate of the car,btohqsg
but the car not even for sale,btohqsg
Heard before FD2R body value last time at 10k,btohqsg
I guess most of the performance car body value is high cause can export,btohqsg
Btw  the 2 roads relayed already last weekend. This few days drive through very smooth!,btohqsg
I can see why folks will pay up for the jdm,btohqsg
Just the fd2 and fd2r alone the diff is thr alr.,btohqsg
Next one i aim vezel liao‚Ä¶ 25km/l,btohqsg

Nobody there at the chop counter,btohqsg
If no ppl at the counter,btohqsg
Every time go overseas oso need to stamp one,btohqsg
Later u come out..no chop..considered illegal entry wor,btohqsg
Counter no ppl....is not a valid reason one wor,btohqsg
We will lost one admin due to unlawful reasons üò≠,btohqsg
U shld know more abt it mah Sir Jon,btohqsg
I kanna before  when you come back to the Malaysia custom just tell them you did pass the passport to the Malaysia custom but they didn‚Äôt chop.After which they will bring you into their office and just have to wait. No fine whatsoever.,btohqsg
Even if you go back their customs and tell them your process of entering msia  they will peng story say cctv spoil so your reason not valid,btohqsg
No chop serious enough to detain you for hours. That's true,btohqsg
Yeah .that why I said...must see luck liao,btohqsg
If they check and what you said is not true prepare for the worst lo,btohqsg
You got travel to other country b4?,btohqsg
I hope all be well for admin ......fingers crossedüôè,btohqsg
Have to check properly if stamped and with proper details anot,btohqsg
Illegal entry to other country is not something to be taken lightly at any countries not just bolehland,btohqsg
I thought now change the counter infront end up go infront is jb alr fml,btohqsg
Where got change counter go infront de??,btohqsg
Best qns is why counter no open can go through,btohqsg
Ya i say i thought alr what how i know,btohqsg
I m sure it is a geniune oversight that the custom can understand,btohqsg
Afterall 2yrs no cross borders liao,btohqsg
Some times msia customs can cock up stuffs also,btohqsg
That why I think being polite and stay cool head does help in such situation,btohqsg
Just calm yourself and explain to them lo,btohqsg
Dun fret too much..just go back n explain can liao..rather than facing issue while returning back,btohqsg
i just ask my friend in sg custom he say go back msia custom rectify now,btohqsg
How far are you in now?,btohqsg
I just love the part where she mistaken herself when she want to change counter üò±üò±,btohqsg
but should be no issue ah cause just enter only,btohqsg
Usually I will just come out my car and look for a customs officer for help. They will be happy to help,btohqsg
Same..kana before similar situation 6yrs ago,btohqsg
Just enter should be still ok.,btohqsg
Counter open..but no one inside....I walk out of car n seek assistance from next counter,btohqsg
Check the stamp details then I went off,btohqsg
Hope all is well for admin,btohqsg

Best part Malaysia customs tell me go uturn in the middle of the causeway if I want to come back in,btohqsg
But I couldn't find it  so end up back at sg customs then tell them about it. They get the bicycle police escort my car to some immigration office. After everything cleared  the bicycle police escort me back onto the causeway,btohqsg
So that don't need to line up at sg side,btohqsg
Oh happened to me zz. Ya they dont let me go back msia even tho got a way. 4 cars convoy uturn at middle of causeway lol we saw some rubber cones den just whack,btohqsg
