Some is alibaba 1 with 26-28 depreciation,btohqsg
wonder what the major complaints are,btohqsg
I floor my car a lot my range around 400 on,btohqsg
400 km   but never reall bother as I charge daily,btohqsg
Charge daily ok de ah? DC or AC?,btohqsg
you dont have to charge daily,btohqsg
you need to use 3 phase charging plug?,btohqsg
Like you charge your phone   no la I using wall mounted ac,btohqsg
U been to msia already? and back? Ok de?,btohqsg
Malaysia easy la   a lot of ev go in for free charging,btohqsg
so have you taken your car to malaysia? free charging,btohqsg
I never been to Malaysia but friends do that a lot u can go and google,btohqsg
i have been playing there a few times,btohqsg
i wonder how much they charge now for 3 hours?,btohqsg
I don’t know maybe I check for you later,btohqsg
take the m3 there to play,btohqsg
Got video  he was driving at normal speed,btohqsg
His tyre can drive till like this can’t be suddenly,btohqsg
it is not possible this is sudden,btohqsg
Really suddenly… can see the tyres roll off from the rear cam,btohqsg
how can it sheer off like that,btohqsg
He still drive and ignore warning,btohqsg
cx of course made in malayisa. high volume,btohqsg
only 3 6 are fully CBU,btohqsg
driver is not vigilant. could be underinflated for a long time,btohqsg
I screen record the video here,btohqsg
i can hear loud noise prior to this,btohqsg
it is so obvious the noise like driving a truck,btohqsg
good thing he's not driving fast,btohqsg
haha that thing rolled off in one piece,btohqsg
Some prefer suv  easier to get in and out for elderlys,btohqsg
main reason is TALL  females especially like it they sit high and think safe,btohqsg
For drive  of cuz sedan is better…,btohqsg
And suv  can see far when u are stucked in jam. And able to cut a queue easier than sedan,btohqsg
If u need to E-brake  u just release the throttle fully?,btohqsg
1 pedal driving is for smooth journey,btohqsg
that why u see alot of ev on the express way keep 2 cars length  so they will not use the brake at all,btohqsg
i keep watching youtube how one pedal work,btohqsg
To me after u use 1 pedal driving u will not go back to standard car driving   is so easy to control acceleration and de acceleration and so smooth,btohqsg
It like instant respond for your car to go fasT or slow   and it very linear,btohqsg
it is like playing electric toy car  same concept.magnetic field,btohqsg
just like how servos work sortof,btohqsg
instant torque.  robots welding precision all based on electric motors,btohqsg
Since the e-motor only stops the driven wheels  many vehicles will automatically employ the hydraulic brakes on the other two wheels if loss of traction is detected. One-pedal driving is convenient  safe  and gives the rotors and brake pads a rest.,btohqsg
but when you press pedal  there soud be moderation right? otherwise you will collide suddenly,btohqsg
like you wanttomovea littlebit. how do you do that,btohqsg
acceleration is very sensitive just press down gradually lol,btohqsg
it like driving go kart very easy 1 haha  that why i always floor my car haha,btohqsg
i feel sad if there is no chance to floor the car during the journey,btohqsg
There’s creep setting. You just turn it on can alr.,btohqsg
