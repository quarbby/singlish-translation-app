Wonder what happened. Tis could mean visa uturn,btohqsg
We have to thank all the early reacter who deleted transactions in their CardUp and iPayMy üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Personally  I think the bulk of CardUp and iPayMy personal is people using it to pay their mortgages.Nice amount per month. The rest like education  rent and maintenance fees  helper salaries usually not that hefty.,btohqsg
Hi all for ocbc 360 account spending criteria  can i split the $500 spending across ocbc rewards and ocbc 365 card? Thanks,btohqsg
You can but why? Don't u need to hit 800 for ocbc 365 cc cashback,btohqsg
My spending with ocbc mainly online shopping. Planning to earn more miles thru rewards.Lazy to switch the telco and utility bills out to ocbc rewards.So wondering if it is to charge to both cards for aggregated $500 spending,btohqsg
But your teleco and utilities will only get 0.25% cashback if you don't hit 800 spend on ocbc 365 card,btohqsg
Is there a minimum balance requirement for bonus saver account? Just received the save up level up reward... Think to empty it,btohqsg
Hi all  I recently applied for the Trust cashback credit card  but my application was rejected. It's my first time applying for a credit card  and I haven't taken any loans either. My annual salary is well above 30 000 SGD  so I'm unsure why it was declined. Since Trust Bank didn‚Äôt provide a reason  does anyone have insights on what the issue might be?,btohqsg
Random guess. Do you have cc with standard chartered?,btohqsg
No  nothing with standard chartered. This is my first time applying for a credit card.,btohqsg
citi rewards vs ocbc rewards  which is better and why?,btohqsg
Was your assessable income in 2023 at least 30k?,btohqsg
Yeah  it is well above 30k,btohqsg
Depends on your spending  accounts you have  and your reward goal. Most will tell you CRMC is a must have as it's a great general spend miles card when paired with Amaze card.,btohqsg
i have the ocbc 360 account,btohqsg
Citi rewards is way better than ocbc rewards. Unless you are in miles game and want to clock ocbc 360 saving acct spend.,btohqsg
Just try applying again I guess.,btohqsg
My standard chartered cc got declined then within 1 month applied to trust Cashback card which got approved. üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I don't know if re-applying immediately is a good option. Maybe give couple of months and re-try. Any opinion from the experts? ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Userserhiyhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:get to the point,btohqsg
I have very bad experience with Trust cash back card,btohqsg
Honestly no harm. If they have no prior bad credit and need the min salary requirements.,btohqsg
Trust bank is always interesting case for me. Opened account a d trust link cc ages ago. 1 fine day they reduced my credit limit to 2k. And refused increasing my limit. üòÖ,btohqsg
Could the credit limit I requested have contributed to the rejection?,btohqsg
Maybe you can ask them to decide on the limit first.,btohqsg
Before applied the card  i checked with their staff if purchased in app (icloud/apple pay)is determined to online shop or not. Staff say yes  that is count in online shop category. The first 10days  i checked that bill is really under online shop category  but after 1 week later  i login to Trust check again  the all icloud/apple pay changed to under Others category .,btohqsg
This is the case of cso doesn't know better. Their online shopping has specific mcc.,btohqsg
Then I contacted with their staff  they ask me to show them providence.,btohqsg
You didn't screenshot the chat with them? Risky move.,btohqsg
Btw  does trust cashback even have online shop category?Their category depends only on mcc  not online or offline.,btohqsg
I have  but all already changed to Others,btohqsg
Unable to share the screenshot with youü•π,btohqsg
Hello Gurus! Paying for entry into airport lounge like Plaza Premium or SATS Premier is considered what MCC code? What miles card to use? Thanks in advance~,btohqsg
Saw the screenshots. You should appeal.,btohqsg
Which is very specific. I have ordered from casetify website 3 times  1 count under Shopping  2 count under Others.,btohqsg
Bought the same/similar thing all 3 times?,btohqsg
It do seem like 5732 transactions are not eligible under Shopping. You are better off appealing and asking. especially that you have proof that another CSO said it's valid.,btohqsg
Yes  i have send the screenshot to them  they just ignored it and keep saying they follow the MCC code.üò§,btohqsg
Then it's true  5732 is not eligible. That's why Challenger is also not eligible. They could be clearer in their t&cs tho.They placed the mcc list elsewhere:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/241552,btohqsg
Yes  totally agree! Their T&C make ppl confused.,btohqsg
I'd say take it as a lesson. This is the valid mcc for your referencehttps://trustbank.sg/legal/kfs_cashback/,btohqsg
