What card to use for klook payment? HSBC revo?,btohqsg
10k from the 10x points  anything more is just 1x,btohqsg
Rumors has it that Shopback codes Klook voucher as Restaurants  so you may buy them and use on Klook. Personally I have not tested so YMMV,btohqsg
I called their hotline in sg and apparently abit unsure abt their customer service quality really,btohqsg
Hi all  I notice fave pay canâ€™t use the universal sg QR code.. other than grab pay  liquid pay the best?  I using ShopBack app to pay also if they have.For kopitiam and hawker payment,btohqsg
Personally I go in this order  if first one don't have I move on to second one etc.1. Shopback Pay2. FavePay3. LiquidPay,btohqsg
Fave not so popular at my hawker leh. Many donâ€™t accept,btohqsg
All deposits in RHB are insured by SDIC by up to $75k,btohqsg
LiquidPay is more widely accepted than FavePay,btohqsg
Time to say bye bye to coins,btohqsg
Cashless the way to go lol,btohqsg
sadly still got some shops don't even accept Nets or PayNow  have to pay by cash... haiz,btohqsg
Unless it is very urgent to get the stuff from the shops  usually Iâ€™ll skip the shop and go elsewhere to get my stuff.,btohqsg
Hi guys  is it possible to get miles (amaze+citibank) through topup of youtrip?,btohqsg
I would think itâ€™s excluded.MCC is still the same. I might be wrong,btohqsg
so i guess the best way is to get UOB absolute ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
easy to test  can top up minimal amount and 2-3 days later can see get point or not. Not like HSBC or DBS that need month later to check,btohqsg
how do i see whats the minimal amount to get point? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
or you mean minimal topup to youtrip,btohqsg
But like no gifts now if you are a new signup,btohqsg
Thanks  what do I get signing up through this link?,btohqsg
Ah okay so I should wait till they are offering gifts then I sign up?,btohqsg
Yes  if you are new to bank,btohqsg
YouTrip cannot use GPMC to top up ready.So cannot get 1.7%,btohqsg
tks! hv anyone tried RHB high yield savings account?,btohqsg
do you know of anyway to get any rewards to topup into youtrip?,btohqsg
Hmm currently donâ€™t have  at least not that I know of.,btohqsg
Hi all  may I know the interest for UOB bank is paid monthly?,btohqsg
Wonder how often the interest rate changes?,btohqsg
hv anyone tried RHB high yield savings account?08:18 PM,btohqsg
how to maximise the return? either at one go put in as much money as possible? when is the interest given?,btohqsg
but my query was more on how to MAXIMISE the profit? if u have any hacks on that?,btohqsg
and I know first 75k insured by SDIC. If anything more than 75k what would happen if smthg happens?,btohqsg
Hi guys  is there any guide on UOB ONE acc and which UOB cc is best to pair with UOB ONE acc?,btohqsg
Hi does paying your SP services (spgroup) via AXS app with the amaze card (paired with Citibank rewards card) grant you the full 10x miles rewards?,btohqsg
depends which one suits u better,btohqsg
is there any where to give example of how UOB one acc calculates the first 30k etc,btohqsg
as in calculate average daily balance?,btohqsg
What i want to know is if i put in 100k today  do i still need to keep increasing the monthly incremental for every month moving forward?,btohqsg
In regards to the UOB ONE acc,btohqsg
So i only need to do this once and i will keep getting 7.8% once i can fulfill every monthly spend,btohqsg
hmm where did the 2% go to?,btohqsg
7.8% only applies to the 75k-100k. anything below 75k earns lower interest.,btohqsg
Right so if i put in 100k  i can get 7.8%. is there admin charge?,btohqsg
if u put in 100k u get 5% effective on the 100k.,btohqsg
I would say in order for MAS to allow rhb to setup consumer category banking there must defintely be some form of safety nets set aside to be able to operate here. Yes i agree to trust your money up to 75k if u not ready but 75k cannoy qualifying for pp account. So need to individually weight the risk,btohqsg
What about Citi rewards card. Do I still get 10x rewards on the axs app?,btohqsg
Hi  for UOB one acc min spend $500. Can debit card top up grab pay?,btohqsg
cant help but be skeptical to put much in non local banks,btohqsg
Hi  im planning to get the amaze + city rewards combo  and have a few qns.If I topup my youtrip card with amaze  does it give 4mpd?If i pay insurance with amaze  does it give 4mpd?,btohqsg
