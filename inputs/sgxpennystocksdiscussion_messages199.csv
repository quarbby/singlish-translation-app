Big buyup at closing for singtel .,btohqsg
Horror for 9am to 10am buyers,btohqsg
More to come when the micro pennies cool down,btohqsg
Haha when stock goes up too fastIt will come down fast too,btohqsg
I think ifast more pain than that.. MT -0.15 (12.82%) IFAST -1.21 (31.03%),btohqsg
Ohya starburst! Was thinking eh recently got 1 stock gap down alot also but cant rmb the name..,btohqsg
Will ifast recover. Imagine those who bought last fri. Due to sudden chiong ip,btohqsg
Sometimes they say direct pain better la,btohqsg
Why singapore never support local ah? Hmm,btohqsg
This one at least if cut on day 1 can do damage control lol.. ifast starburst no chance cut loss,btohqsg
Ok la I did for MT,btohqsg
Same.. mt was pain but learnt a lesson from it haha,btohqsg
I did in day 1 also,btohqsg
Sometimes not cutting might be a blessing in disguise,btohqsg
Don't say that.. I experienced such heart attack in medical too..painful..,btohqsg
MT also intra day from 0.9+ drop to 0.6+ ma,btohqsg
When gap down and day graph is L shape  don hope for recovery liao.. miracle do happen but not often,btohqsg
Remember VP selldown also damn painful,btohqsg
It will only be painful for those that buy on Friday leh,btohqsg
Those that hold quite a while Liao painful as it is can tide thru one la,btohqsg
But I think counters that gap down alot might have dead cat bounce.. happened for starburst mt  so might be looking at one for ifast in coming days?,btohqsg
I panick like hell...same scenario as ifast  gap down so much .. Cant even react..,btohqsg
When counter up a lot must also accept that it might down a lot,btohqsg
I accepted that for MT lol,btohqsg
Jt got gap up then sell down.. got give chance one,btohqsg
Oh ya that was close to 30 also,btohqsg
Lol how many will take the chance?,btohqsg
At least got chance.. gap down is no chance suck thumb,btohqsg
Is good to be coward... gap up fall below prev close should run road liao...,btohqsg
These kind of things happen to everyone ba,btohqsg
Dun forget eindec got sell down from 180 also,btohqsg
Will MT and UG recover in next quarter results? Gloves are still in great demand though vaccine is out.,btohqsg
I think they talking about instant gap down pre open,btohqsg
No chance for you to sell those type,btohqsg
Oh ok.. I regret din cut my eindec... Now holding hoping for miracle,btohqsg
As long as the stock is still alive and kicking got chance loh,btohqsg
If you don't want to cut that's the only thing you can do ka,btohqsg
If not pray for it to be suspended meh then all hopes are lost liao,btohqsg
amplefieldon a daily basis. highest volume since 22 oct and attempt to test the yellow channel. closing 37 and above will be a clearer signal. staying tuned for further catalyst,btohqsg
The 2 big A stock also I hoping miracle for 3 mths d... Ep at 0.3,btohqsg
Short term wise for MT  not likely to test back 1.5 series. BBs maybe fry until 1.3 then kill it again.,btohqsg
This week. Hoping for Amplefield to close 37. The day that happens will be start of Something exciting,btohqsg
Just need one more positive vaccine news,btohqsg
Yes  there will forever demand of ppe with or without vaccine. The issues are given time  competitors can build new plants and industry capacity will increase  and the asp will have to go down from the unsustainable level. Like MT  long term profit of Usd 50m already good (2022  and beyond),btohqsg
Yes... Those who are still holding above $1... Might need to enter to average down,btohqsg
So sweet also must kick ah,btohqsg

Last week MT down few days  this morning i tot got some announcement..:(,btohqsg
Sound like stuck very high prices too,btohqsg
yahor ... leave it to you bro haha,btohqsg
Does ifast rely only on digital banking licence in the first place for it precious surge? Seems the price drop much over the expected limit bcoz of the licence.,btohqsg
Speculative play I'd say  even if they got the license I think likely to see sell on news as reality meet expectations alr,btohqsg
I see. I thought it will close between $3-$3.2. $2.69 is too unexpected. üò≥,btohqsg
Ya opening price was jaw dropping alr,btohqsg

*Medtecs Int‚Äôl: Self-brand extends growth*https://tinyurl.com/MEDSP-8Dec‚Ä¢ Initiate coverage with Buy  TP S$1.30 (~40% upside)‚Ä¢ Margins to remain high even post pandemic because of more self-branded products‚Ä¢ Attractive at 6.8x FY21/22 PE; FY21F cash holdings ~35% of mkt cap_Sales: Unless Medtecs lands a significant govt contract to start supply soon  Medtecs‚Äô supernormal growth this year is peaking out. A normalized scenario would potentially be our FY22 where projected Vol/ ASP have declined 45%/ 30% from FY20.__So  pegged to normalised EPS (FY22)  Medtecs would be 11.5x PE >> a shade lower than peers average of 16x. Apart from significant contract wins  it would be more attractive if dividend yield is raised since we projected that company would have built up >US$100m cash pile by end FY21 and can reinstate dividend payout of 25-50% vs our 10% assumptions._,btohqsg
