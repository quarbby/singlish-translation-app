bad case of nasi lemak with bad sambal?,btohqsg
why the school sign board screams military camp already,btohqsg
nope. gastroenteritis - i assume this mean food poisoning haha,btohqsg
you say Nasi Lemak with bad Sambal ?,btohqsg
just an assumption on what they ate. Typically in Malaysia  food poisoning cases are from nasi lemak gone rancid.,btohqsg
hi guys  anyone knows where i can sign up for industry attachment during the dec hols. for context i am j1 and i couldnt go from my school and thats why i am asking,btohqsg
which industry are you looking at,btohqsg
like something related to engineering/science research,btohqsg
Not much point for engineering generally  from ex-engineer POV.Your level of knowledge is insufficient at the moment.,btohqsg
What you planning to do in your degree?,btohqsg
I thought singapore have those A**Star program things,btohqsg
yea but the deadline over alr and im not singaporean,btohqsg
for 1 month  you don't really benefit,btohqsg
but i really need it for my portfolioðŸ« ,btohqsg
2 weeks is onboarding and offboarding,btohqsg
you don't really need that for engineering or research,btohqsg
u can't do anything in 2 weeks,btohqsg
I mean if you want to do astar maybe can uh if it is like a jc attachement thing but that is if it is a jc kind of thing,btohqsg
If your grades are there  you are better off polishing interview skills.,btohqsg
ahhh you Malaysian  or what? I'm not sure about Singapore Internship things as a foreigner.,btohqsg
that's the best portfolio u can have,btohqsg
Actually if you dont mind me asking,btohqsg
If you like Programming  I believe 42 Singapore / 42 KL / 42 Johor* exists.,btohqsg
like how? can give example irdk,btohqsg
42KL been blowing up strongly in Sunway Malaysia.,btohqsg
I'm sorry but if u ownself what u wna do in the future  hard for me to give example,btohqsg
What are you aiming to study in university. It's all about grades if you are looking at local uni,btohqsg
easiest example to give is if u want go computer engineering  then do coding project,btohqsg
not sure tho but maybe design engineering or chemical engineering,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrm77GCfjXk- Apparently it is conducting in SUTD.,btohqsg
that one JC too early for portfolio la,btohqsg
join volunteering or outside leadership stuff,btohqsg
not sure my friend was Malaysian  he gotten into the A**Star program doing AI stuff as a studying as a Mechanical Engineer at NUS.,btohqsg
Grades AND portfolio is equally impt,btohqsg
but my friends all did jc industry attachement,btohqsg
so i abit scared idh enough,btohqsg
engineering not much on any portfolio during JC.Knowledge is grossly insufficient  and this is known. HR will just ignore your JC stuff.,btohqsg
but this time 70 rp leh,btohqsg
go to IC design field. Also not much knowledge  if the job is data collection.Atmost everyday compiled test reports into nice looking charts.,btohqsg
Some internship is do nothing  learn nothing. End up waste time only.,btohqsg
u can read up more into the field lor  get your own knowledge into the industry,btohqsg
yall got any other tips for portfolio?,btohqsg
for engineering  there really isn't that much at your level,btohqsg
Actually since you are aiming for a STEM related industry,btohqsg
u mean tutoring as in via hours,btohqsg
btw  you studying Chemical Engineering for learning chemical reactions. Or just want to help company handling Plant Operations? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
at a jc level  there's genuinely nothing you can do apart froma) having rly good grades (including science Olympiads and wtv other similar things)b) volunteering  having a leadership position (be it in school or outside),btohqsg
if you are not scoring >80% for any subject yet  you might as well work on them,btohqsg
for local uni  if you have the grades it's really not an issue for most engineering fields,btohqsg
Tbh I think she can still tutor mostly those doing O levels at max.,btohqsg
