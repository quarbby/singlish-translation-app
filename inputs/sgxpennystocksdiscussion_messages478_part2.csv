Your Evening Read ‚Äì 21 July 2021Dark clouds are gatheringThe stock market had a robust run on Tuesday  but investors should be mindful of possible volatility and pain ahead.The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) had risen by about 42% from 30 June to Monday as S&P had fallen by 1.6%  a dark day since months ago. The rising Covid-19 cases have spooked investors as the worry of peak growth continued to haunt the market.If history is a guide  we might see between one to three more weeks of volatility ahead of us  and in most cases  a possible lower stock prices.S&P 500 is taking a break?The index had fallen below a critical level which indicates possibly more pain. The index had dropped below the 50-day moving average on Monday. As some point out  this occurred in 6 out of the 7 months this year  usually followed by subsequent pullbacks.Surprises are everywhere!The market may warrant more surprises as the contagious Delta variant can unleash a new round of economic damage. Moreover  some analysts believe that the cases may not have peaked and could rise to 100 000 daily cases in the coming weeks based on experience seen in Israel and the UK.Pika World is ready for a possible dip set up for entry if the pullback is set to continue.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a broader audience.,btohqsg

"Sembmarine flags liquidity issues in response to Sias queries about proposed S$1.5b rights issue1. IN response to queries raised by the media and Securities Investors Association (Singapore)  or Sias  Sembcorp Marine Sembcorp Marine: S51 -9.65% (Sembmarine) cited the ""prolonged and severe downturn"" in the offshore and marine (O&M) industry since 2015  due to the collapse in oil prices  and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic as reasons for its earlier proposed S$1.5 billion rights issue.2. ""The remaining S$0.3 billion net proceeds from last year's rights issue is now insufficient  as it has progressively become evident that the impact of Covid-19 and the industry downturn has been more protracted than originally anticipated "" Sembmarine said.3. While the group's board did consider other financing options  it settled on the equity rights issue as its fully committed nature meant that the group and its stakeholders would be assured that it will raise the approximately S$1.5 billion that it needs until at least the end of 2022.Source link in headerMore here",btohqsg
