Like I have what I wanna write in my head,btohqsg
But I can't think of how to transcribe it into words.,btohqsg
ok sorry as in we just ended week 9 so,btohqsg
week 10 is a good time for me to start,btohqsg
yea that one can't help it la but my only experience is with reports which is a lot more concrete and easy to plan out,btohqsg
for 4y right  it is the first time i actually hv an afternoon slot for this exam,btohqsg
just plan out in maybe 30 mins to an hour,btohqsg
rest of the time i just type non stop,btohqsg
morning slot i really cannot...like reporting at 7.45,btohqsg
wtf all my exams have been afternoon,btohqsg
i was referring to just 1 particular exam half of the cohort is in the morn the other half is in the afternoon,btohqsg
hmm try to find a way to appreciate it in some way or find relevance to smth you wanna do,btohqsg
dragging yourself through 2 more years of mods,btohqsg
i feel like i love my internship more then erm studying,btohqsg
im approaching the 2 year mark  i can do that for another 2 years  hopefully,btohqsg
but ya i gets your advise,btohqsg
but isn't yours like the week 13 hell kind,btohqsg
im approaching the 4th year mark,btohqsg
I feel like I cannot treat it like work,btohqsg
It's like that but the stress is constant,btohqsg
but before that i need to survive another 1.5 mths first,btohqsg
Cuz essays all have to be submitted nonstop over the semester,btohqsg
like i no joke almost dropped out of my phd bc i was still too last min and the quality of research i had reflected that,btohqsg
once i started doing it a bit earlier and actually focused on the quality,btohqsg
I doing it next sem so I just biting the bullet and power thru it,btohqsg
it was way easier to hit my groove,btohqsg
I am so sick and tired of writing tho,btohqsg
actually hor it was my internship that got my passion back,btohqsg
so im happy that i did not give up or what sort,btohqsg
yeah i need to learn how to either insert procrastination in my schedule to strike a balance or start earlier so that the procrastination wont bite me in the ass during finals because i'll be prepared by then,btohqsg
Yo grandpa this popped up on my YouTube feedhttps://youtu.be/VRuPM1mXR1o?si=6KlyufavsnRmQUqH,btohqsg
my bed time was supposed to be timed 23min ago lol,btohqsg
yep yep will do  cant be riding the just pass wave for long,btohqsg
nothing wrong with that  just want something better for myself,btohqsg
yea i mean depends on your goals in the end la,btohqsg
"tbh one little thing i always did was aim to finish studying 1-2 days before the test and save the remaining days for ""practice""",btohqsg
what ends up happening is i go too slow and take the 1-2 days to finish,btohqsg
but end up still ok leh,btohqsg
honest to god i usually never do any practice before the test/finals itself lmao,btohqsg
what ends up happening is me reading the solutions and convincing myself i know whats going on,btohqsg
Like I don't print out the solution sheet at all purposely,btohqsg
And only have the question sheet and force myself to do it,btohqsg
And then after I do it I then refer to the solutions,btohqsg
thats indeed the most ideal way of doing things but,btohqsg
the self control isnt there lmao,btohqsg
try the starting earlier part first then see,btohqsg
I find that it's sometimes better to purposely make it inconvenient for yourself to force that behaviour,btohqsg
yeah honestly this is probably one situation where pen and paper would make sense,btohqsg
because if im using my ipad to do work its just a matter of logging into ntulearn and downloading the solutions,btohqsg
Yeah that's the issue lmao so I have the questions and notes and that's about it,btohqsg
