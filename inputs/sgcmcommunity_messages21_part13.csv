All we ask is  make direct comparisons and don't pass sweeping statements. Be open to other brands also lah,btohqsg

Well actually we are more concerned for the community because some might read and believe your statements and be misguided,btohqsg
Seem like one started and the rest smelled blood regardless of topic,btohqsg
Provide recall statistics also you don't want to see,btohqsg
i have heard a lot of owners change out rod bearings pre-emptively because of the worry,btohqsg
