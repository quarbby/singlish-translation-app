i wanted to ask if anyone has had their telegram account hacked,btohqsg
is there anyway to retrieve my channels,btohqsg
i learnt this happened like since last night 2.20 even tho i was asleep,btohqsg
"someone texted me that ""i"" left their channel",btohqsg
this morning i found that all the channels and group chats i was in are all gone,btohqsg
now it's just channels and group chats i don't recognise (diff language),btohqsg
":"") oh my god i am so panicky rn",btohqsg
If it helps I have the private candidates grp link,btohqsg
Saw that u left at like 2am,btohqsg
yeah  i checked with a friend that i left around 2.20,btohqsg
the person who was using my acc prob set me to leave everything at the same time,btohqsg
If you have not changed your phone you can 1. try logging via TG desktop to see devices  last login2. Check for any OTP messages for any unauthorised message3. Voice mail. Not many people know but voice mail is also a common way to get hacked,btohqsg
what do i do if i find otp messages thru channels,btohqsg
Nothing much you can do except.Lodge a police report with the information that you have. Should the account/device/ip or other credentials be involved in any other reports lodged  it may aid the investigating officers for other crime related offences committed using those credential.For current devices logged into your account  you can go to devices section and see.Additionally  opt in for 2FA under settings and untick the option that allows non contacts to add you in a group.,btohqsg
i figured  i went to check earlier on and my settings has been switched off :/thank you for the advice!!,btohqsg
Not sure what that means hahaha,btohqsg
Does anyone know if withdrawal forms need register,btohqsg
i switched from allowing everyone to add me into channels and groups  to just contacts,btohqsg
