Most likely not if I not wrong,btohqsg
Hi can anyone suggestion the whole process after paying $1000 for option fee.Been one month plus no sound from HDB. HLE already approved but we are looking for bank loan meanwhile.So do we just need to wait or do something,btohqsg
Anyone from yio chu kang beacon?,btohqsg
I wrote in that time due to this as i have a better job offer  the hdb representative that contact me told me hdb loan goes by length of employment. If u does not want to be affected  u need to make sure there is no lapse in ur pay. Meaning you have to start work straightaway for ur next job without taking any break before ur next employment starts,btohqsg
For bank loan it doesnt matter as they go by salary   the higher the salary the more u can loan for bank loan,btohqsg
den just make sure there is no downtime on ur salary. So that u can produce 3 mths pay slip,btohqsg
It doesnt matter that is from different company so long is full 3mths,btohqsg
My case i work in my company for 11 yrs alr so if i wan to change job must make sure i start work straight away without taking any break,btohqsg
So in this case i fufill that 1 yr mag,btohqsg
Only den it wont affect my hdb loan,btohqsg
Just make sure no break inbetween ur current and future job.,btohqsg
Quit on 22nd den start new job the following day,btohqsg
Yes u can check with them again,btohqsg
That lady advise me better nope,btohqsg
Cos they will go pro rate,btohqsg
The lady who advised me is calling from the loan dept,btohqsg
Cos i escalated quite high up that time,btohqsg
Hdb quite strict on their loan,btohqsg
They will really go pro rate,btohqsg
So curious. Will the amt change when we renew HLE? Or stay quo.,btohqsg
Depends on your latest income  has it changed since the last application for hle?,btohqsg
Then should be no change lor. Or become 0,btohqsg
If your length of service not long enough.,btohqsg
Ok. Then I rather it remain at current loan amt,btohqsg
Ur hle can last so long ah,btohqsg
I tot usually have to reapply.,btohqsg
Hi. Anyone from Rivervale Shore BTO. Any telegram link for the grp chat. Thanks,btohqsg
How many times do we need to reapply to produce to them the HLE letter? For e.g i have one during selection day. Later part do i need to produce one more?,btohqsg
Yes. During key collection. Use to be only once during key collection.,btohqsg
But I think during flat selection submitting HLE is more for a guide to how much u need to pay/loan during key collection.,btohqsg
Ohhh meaning flat selection HLE letter does not determine how much loan you will receive at the end of the day?Cause usually our pay will definitely increases in the next 4 years or so… so meaning the loan amount will be adjusted nearing to key collections right?,btohqsg
So what about the grant amounts? Which stage do we know how much grant we’re entitled and will it varies in any stages?,btohqsg
You should call hdb directly to check. I always call esp w grants. Helps to clear it up,btohqsg
Hi all. Got an enquiry if a single purchased a resales hdb. Later got married. Never put spouse as co occuiper can the spouse go n buy another hdb? Sole owner each,btohqsg
Nope. But i think spouse can buy as single before u both get married. If after married cant buy alone unless pte,btohqsg
For BTO  grant amount will be granted before your flat selection.,btohqsg
Ya  before ur flat selection  which is also ur payment of first 5%  u will get liao.,btohqsg
Then u can use ur grant to pay for stamp duty and first 5%,btohqsg
The amount they give u will be at that point of time  later stage ur change job get higher salary ur grant won't be affected. It is at the point of application.,btohqsg
You can use this to calculate ur HLE. Quite accurate also. Bcos HLE u can only apply twice. Once before flat selection and once before key collection  if I'm not wrong.I tried to apply again to see how much I'll get cos I wanna do some budgettjbg but the system don't allow. They say I have existing. Oh well.,btohqsg

Nope  cos we are getting our keys,btohqsg
So then mean still within contract.,btohqsg
Yalo  i very puzzled with this.Cos my brother staying at 476A but he havent get key.,btohqsg
Once the first person take key  it means no compensation alr.They can easily say u haven take key cos havent reach ur turn  but system alr give key to first person.,btohqsg
Seems like only 476A is ready right?,btohqsg
Phase 2 how many blocks? 4?,btohqsg

I have question. I have HLE. So my cpf housing grant won't change until submit new hle?,btohqsg
HLE and grant are two diff thing,btohqsg
HLE is just how much loan u can getGrant is just how much grant u can get,btohqsg
Oh. Grants can be changed if I have salary increment? Or when grant is fixed/confirmed?,btohqsg
Grant is given at that point of time,btohqsg
For example  u submitted docs and get a grant of 50kBut 3 months down the road  u got increment  ur grant will not be affected.,btohqsg
If I remember   it should be unit choosing.,btohqsg
When u choose ur flat  ur grant should be in alr,btohqsg
That's when it's time to pay?,btohqsg
Our resale completion date may be delayed. That's why I am worried about grant,btohqsg
Let's say. My resale application (submitted through hdb website) is last June. Grants won't be changed until next year June?,btohqsg
Hahaha noooo the 12 month is the salary average,btohqsg
Like if their grant is base on 12 months prior to ur application,btohqsg
Ah chey. It doesn't mention how long 😅,btohqsg
After I submitted application  grant is confirmed and fixed?,btohqsg
Let me see if my cousin knows. He got resale.,btohqsg
Once they tell u how much u will get  it's fixed,btohqsg
Oh okay. Thanks alot for helping!,btohqsg
Yeah. My grant is fixed haha. Thanks!! 👍,btohqsg
Let’s say our expected completion date is 3rd quarter of 2023  any possibility of getting the keys earlier?,btohqsg
I guess that is very unpredictable especially now when there's still covid restrictions and other shortages slowing down construction work,btohqsg
Be glad if your project is not delayed by a year. Many of my friends kena liao.,btohqsg
I wonder if alr delay 1 yr will it get delay again..,btohqsg
Suppose to get mine in sep2021,btohqsg
My guess is you will get it by next sep.,btohqsg
Realized my bto 93% completed. Any guide and recommendation for dummy on renovation and process after u got keys?,btohqsg
regarding the 93% completed  if it's from BTOHQ page  do take it w a grain of salt  it is not accurate nor official. it can also jump back from 99% to 80+% cuz it's not accurate  it's just a rough estimation only,btohqsg
Yup. Target date is 2022 mar. Also need to start planning.,btohqsg
My bto at Tengah. Supposed to get early 2023 but delayed until end of 2023,btohqsg
May i know if forest spring starts to take keys alr?,btohqsg
Hi  can I get all of your opinions on Tengah and why you chose them? I’m a single and prefers somewhere like Punggol  Woodlands  and Yishun. But if really no luck in securing during the SBF  then perhaps need to consider Tengah or resale. Maybe I can be convinced to get Tengah,btohqsg
normally is West people will apply for Tengah.Based on my friends.,btohqsg
I can just say tengah is the new punggol hdb is going to put the most budget and effort for tengah to succeed compare to other hdb projects tengah building layout and amenities would be better it just will need time for the estate to mature,btohqsg
Minimum waiting time for tengah to classify as mature will take at least 30 years.Look at sengkang  it is more than 25 years but still not mature estate.Conveniency is still the most importsnt factor.Unless u work in the west  if not travelling time is really a concern.😀,btohqsg
Anyone knows the upcoming locations for sbf ?,btohqsg
Noone know....just wait for hdb to announce....,btohqsg
Has anyone given up their BTO?,btohqsg
Would like to get in touch with u,btohqsg

Only know will have Geylang  Yishun and Tengah again.,btohqsg
Hello do u guys think today they open sbf and bto for nov2021?,btohqsg
Nobody outside of HDB would know  we just have to wait,btohqsg
A lot of people waiting. I’m checking the site daily. 😆,btohqsg
Usually is announce on wed if I am not wrong.,btohqsg
over the past few yrs  the nov exercise launches on tuesdays,btohqsg
My best guess is it'll be next week  but they could surprise us this week since the public holiday is over. But based on past patterns  it's always been around mid nov,btohqsg
Hi there does anyone know the next opening flat for Nov fall on which date?,btohqsg
hi there! can i check with you guys during balloting my fiance and i input the wrong amount/info for the monthly gross income are we still able to provide the correct info during our 1st appointment? Thank you!,btohqsg

Can email to HDB  see what they say. Should be no issue.,btohqsg
Shouldnt be a big deal. They’ll get you to double cfm during appt one,btohqsg
So should be only left with next tues or next next tues liao.,btohqsg
Punggol waterway sunrise ii group please,btohqsg
can check with you guys  is HLE compulsory for 1st appt? as the letter they send us under Annex 1 doesnt require us to bring. Thanks1,btohqsg
Anyone knows the link to apply for leveling the cement floor for new BTO before moving in?,btohqsg
I dont think they do confrete screeding anymore  need to find your own contractor,btohqsg
Seriously? I thought I heard ppl say can just ask HDB to do for you and just pay them a cheaper rate,btohqsg
Anyone using fanztec ceiling fans ? Would like to hear some reviews on it 🙏🙏 thanks in advance !,btohqsg

Yup  I’ve applied. As a single  my chances for SBF very slim 😆. But need to try.,btohqsg
Sorry first time applying for parents. If they were to reject after getting shortlisted then will their next chance to apply be slimmer ?,btohqsg
Most likely yes  HDB typically will penalize for a year 🙂,btohqsg
My SBF experience is that they’ll send application for EHG (grant) along with your other paperwork once you’re shortlisted to get a house,btohqsg
You applying as a single too? Where?,btohqsg

A lot of ppl having issues  no hurry,btohqsg
How do you see how many people applied?,btohqsg
Given the covid pandemic. Regarding the SBF estimated completion date per the different projects. Should we still follow the date of completion as per stated on the website  or should we add some time to it. (Eg 6-9months),btohqsg
anyone know for the martial status   if currenly not married yet but will do so before the flat comes   is put single or married ?,btohqsg
Anyone have collected keys from WestScape at Bt.Batok?,btohqsg
Hi all! Does anyone know if i were to apply for another bto/sbf  will my previous queue number be forfeited or would it not matter until i actually get called for selection appointment?,btohqsg
unless you add your fiancee/partner's name into the application too. then you need to r.o.m. before the keys reach you,btohqsg
means i put as married in both our application even when we are not married yet right ?,btohqsg
isn't there an engaged option? i've not done this bro.,btohqsg
hmmm i'll put both as single  and if there's anywhere to indicate an engagement just to be sure,btohqsg
Hi! Just wanna ask for SBF  can we apply for more than one?,btohqsg
hi!!! i’m new here.what would be a safe combined monthly income + CPF + cash savings to have before trying to apply?TIA!,btohqsg
Single. Apply as fiancée/fiancé scheme. If not married =single,btohqsg
sorry   what do you mean ?,btohqsg
oh   i probably missed out this option .,btohqsg
i will take a look again .,btohqsg
https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/calculator/budgetUse this calculator to estimate your budget. You have until signing of lease of agreement to accumulate your cpf for down payment. Agar your timeline from belowStep 1 ApplicationStep 2 result of application (jan 22)Step 3 1st appt to book flat (depends)Step 4 2nd appt to sign lease (6-9mths after step 3)Step 5 3rd appt to collect key (After ECD aka construction complete),btohqsg
if apply for SBF 10% down payment still required?,btohqsg
Hi! I applied for BTO exercise yesterday but i was not given an option to indicate the scheme to apply for (i wanted the fiancé fiancée scheme) but i did indicate the co applicant as my fiancé.when i paid the $10  hdb classified my application under public scheme. i would like to know if this is normal? thanks in advance,btohqsg
i don't see any option as fiancee 🤔,btohqsg
meaning marital status as single and indicate NRIC of husband/wife at the bottom part ?,btohqsg
fiancee = not married =  not husband/wife,btohqsg
but yes need NRIC of male and female applicatant,btohqsg
If you are applying for the fiancée finance scheme  then there will be applicant 1 and 2. When you input  they will ask relationship of applicant 2 to 1. That is where you indicate fiancée/fiancé,btohqsg
But marital status is still single. Because engaged isn’t a marital status.,btohqsg
hi  i did this but was classified under public scheme. is this normal? 😵‍💫 tried calling hdb but the lines r so busy,btohqsg
did you apply with applicant 1 and 2?,btohqsg
no luh i called the whole day liao until they closed at 5pm,btohqsg
i am applicant 1  applicant 2 is my boyfriend,btohqsg
morning has more chance of calling thru,btohqsg
this part need to fill in ?,btohqsg
so is main applicant single   2nd applicant relationship fiance/fiancee but both top and bottom column of NRIC of husband/wife fill in each other NRIC   right ? 😅 so complicated 😅,btohqsg

Or should I wait my luck and pick somewhere else where I have a fair chance to pick the level I want,btohqsg
You may want to search the sgBTO chat got people answer before. According to the chats  need to add as occupier now and then fill up some forms to change to co-applicant and produce the document before flat selection? But better to call hdb to confirm,btohqsg
Kept calling them today but can't get through. Thanks anw!,btohqsg
Took this from Facebook. Someone posted,btohqsg
Wat group is tat in the Facebook,btohqsg
Wanna check with yall  Door and Sanitary fitting i never take.Sanitary fitting is toilet's toilet bowl and basin?,btohqsg
what is Average monthly household income? how do you calculate? Thankyou,btohqsg
add up all the monthly gross income and then divide by # of ppl living in the same hsehold,btohqsg
Actually it should be your past 12 months income divide by 12. If 2 people income it’s total of both income per month. Not per person per month- which I thought it was at first :(,btohqsg
Hi anybody have west plain at bt batok floor plan & the blk location map?,btohqsg
Anyone have started the flat selection at tampines for august bto?,btohqsg
sorry question . Can ii submit intent to buy and still apply for SBF and bto?,btohqsg
oo but if i never comit to a flat?,btohqsg
can i still submit intent to buy?,btohqsg
Hi  i’m new here. I just want to clarify on EHG. It’s based on average of both applicants per month right? If not  can correct me (:,btohqsg
https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/new/schemes-and-grants/cpf-housing-grants-for-hdb-flats/firsttimer-applicantsPlease read the example section of this page  especially if either you or your partner or both have not been working for 12 consecutive months with no gaps,btohqsg
yes if you both worked 12 consecutive months and the pay is the same every month,btohqsg
this is the most all-encompassing formula,btohqsg
yes this  was looking for it  haha,btohqsg
If i have a Q number below the Total unit..  does eithnic Quata matters?,btohqsg
Last 12 months from the date of application right? 😳 Example: Aug 2021 BTO need the Aug 2020-Jul 2021 payslips.,btohqsg
Ehhhhh from my experience is this like this ...,btohqsg
(Person A Total income over 12 months / 12) + (Person B Total income over 12 months / 12),btohqsg
Cos previously my wife was working for 10 months  then for 2 months she was finding a job.,btohqsg
Then the grant came out higher than i thought.Then when i used my formula  it indeed is the grant higher.,btohqsg
Previously i also thought its this formula,btohqsg
So in my scenario  it will be (Total of 10 months salary / 12 months),btohqsg
thanks for the info. could i check which month/year was your project?,btohqsg
then i think the policy has changed. see below:,btohqsg
basically if you have only been working for 1 month out of the 12 months  too bad,btohqsg
Ooohh from Sales Sep 2019 onwards!,btohqsg
yeah think a lot of policies changed from sep 2019! well  good thing that came out of it is that mature estate applicants now have access to grants too,btohqsg
Any idea if the last 12 months is taken from the point of application or?,btohqsg
Example u apply for nov 2021 launch  means they consider ur pay of nov 2020 - oct 2021,btohqsg
ur income will be assessed for the grant early on  then they give you the grant before you pay the downpayment  then no more changes after that,btohqsg
loan amount will change in that case,btohqsg
once they give you the grant  there should be no more changes,btohqsg
hi! saw this grant topic and wanted to ask too. what if last 12 months from date of application my bf worked pt jobs/PHV driver? how would hdb count in this scenario? cause i’ve been drawing different ft pay for last 12 months  but for his case he works on and off as the above mentionedTIA!!,btohqsg
yes  it will first offset your downpayment  then if theres any leftover grant after downpayment  it can be used to offset the flat price,btohqsg
i think it’shouse price (400k) - EHG (40k) = 360k balance360k - 10% down payment = loan amount,btohqsg
400k flat means the downpayment is 40k  if you are taking HDB loan,btohqsg
this downpayment can be paid by cash or CPF,btohqsg
downpayment is 10% of the original flat price,btohqsg
oh is not count this way? hahaa everyone give me different info also 🥲,btohqsg
just rmb to clarify w HDB in the end,btohqsg
oh so will be 400k - 40k (down payment) - ehg 40k = balance to loan from hdb?,btohqsg
you can use EHG to pay the downpayment,btohqsg
the grant will go to ur CPF ordinary account  just take it as it is ur CPF,btohqsg
then you can use it to pay off anything that can be paid using CPF,btohqsg
depends on how you wanna pay off your flat.you are required to pay the downpayment  you can use the grant  your own CPF or your own cash to pay it,btohqsg
How do they actually calculate the grant? Considering we change job in between with different salary,btohqsg
if work pt jobs  studying private school and working as Private hired drivers?,btohqsg
"though  precisely  what you indicated as ""hdb loan"" should be hdb loan + (your cpf oa - 20k)",btohqsg
^ and this also depends on the loan quantum you are granted at CPF. you may need to top up cash depending on your circumstances,btohqsg
Fyi  bank loan rate went up.. now for dbs is 1.36% fixed for 3 yrs,btohqsg
bank loan or hdb loan better now?,btohqsg
Not recommend floating as very likely 2022 n 2023 will go up further,btohqsg
that depends on your financial situation and plans  I guess,btohqsg
is it true if lesser cash on hand should take hdb loan?,btohqsg
if for any reason you cannot pay ur mortgage for a short while  HDB MIGHT be more lenient than banks.HDB as no early repayment penalty  banks probably have,btohqsg
banks require you to pay a chunk of the flat price in cash  i think,btohqsg
if you dont wanna touch cash at all for your house  then use HDB loan,btohqsg
provided you have sufficient money in ur CPF OA,btohqsg
25% down pay. up to 20% by cpf. at least 5% mandatory cash,btohqsg
Yup this is for 1st timer hdb loan might be better,btohqsg
For 2nd timer bank loan will be better choice,btohqsg
Due to hdb require 50% proceed to be paid before the loan u the balance,btohqsg
Hdb loan = 10% cpf + 50% proceeds from flat sold only den they will loan u the balance,btohqsg
Bank loan = 25% with 5% in cash and tat it,btohqsg
Also  rmb besides downpayment  there's also other miscellaneous fees such as stamp duty,btohqsg
Yup this one is regardless bank loan or hdb loan u got to pay,btohqsg
Grant eligibility requires continuous employment the 12 months prior to application.,btohqsg
As long got payslip  can show income  or got pay tax file IRAS should be ok for evidence as income.,btohqsg
"""The buyer or his/her spouse must also be in continuous employment for the 12 months prior and remain working at the point of flat application.""",btohqsg
So for a couple  minimum one pax must draw continuous salary for 12 months prior to application.,btohqsg
Hi guys  Is divorced with child below 18  able to apply for BTO in matured estate ?,btohqsg

This should be the last stack that's not painted. Most of the stacks are complete and painting done.,btohqsg
Yes. And the construction worker did say that this is the first block they started on but because of the multi storey carpark the block was put on hold and became the last to be completed. The worker mentioned it will take another 6 to 8 months.,btohqsg
Ah I see I see. Thanks for the update. Now it all gels with the revised completion date of Q3 2022.,btohqsg
Do we have to wait till all the blocks are completed b4 they will give us the keys?,btohqsg
Hi all! Before flat selection  will i be able to see what are the available units left?,btohqsg

my appointment is on 16/12  however HLE expiring 9/12,btohqsg
is there anyway to extend it?,btohqsg
It will be valid for six months from the date of issue. There is no need for re-assessment during this period  so long as there is no change in financial position and family members. A week before expiry of the HLE letter  you may apply for a new one if you still need a valid HLE letter.,btohqsg
think you can call to make appt in extendinghttps://www.propertyguru.com.sg/property-investment-questions/my-hle-is-expiring-in-3-weeks-time-should-i-sign-the-option-now-or-wait-till-i-renew-my-hle-but-i-worry-owner-sell-to-someone-else-yet-when-i-try-to-renew-my-hle-now-hdb-website-dont-allow-it-says-i-c-232902,btohqsg

Hi  just update u  went to see the progress myself today  only 2 blocks and carpark not really completed from what i see  the rest more or less completed but painting not completed for most  i can say 70% to 80%  rough estimation haha,btohqsg
Thank you for the update. That explains why HDB stated 3Q 2022😅,btohqsg
But they said Q2 2022  i asked hdb again,btohqsg
I receive email from HDB stated Q3 2022. Maybe it depends on individual blocks,btohqsg
Oic  does tat mean some people can move in earlier?,btohqsg
Did u receive email from HDB stated 2Q 2022 or u call them?,btohqsg
2 emails  2nd email just last mth,btohqsg
Hopefully we can move in asap,btohqsg
I see. I will email them Tmr to confirm again,btohqsg
When did u receive ur email,btohqsg
Same I received second delay email around that time and mine stated Q3 2022.,btohqsg
Depending on location.  Punggol is jan 2022.,btohqsg
I think in the application it is stated also when the results will be out,btohqsg
Hi all. Just joined. I’m interested in Ubi grove project. May I know anyone has idea when the sales of balance will be announced?,btohqsg
Hello.Any updates on Fernvale Glades key collection ETC?,btohqsg
Hi i just email hdb yesterdayWe refer to your enquiry.2 The Probable Completion Date (PCD) of your booked flat is currently estimated to be in 1st Quarter 2022 (i.e. Jan to Mar 2022). We are unable to confirm the keys collection date at this juncture as the keys to your booked flat are not available yet. The PCD is reviewed regularly and any updates will be reflected on our HDB InfoWEB atwww.hdb.gov.sg. You may log in using your Singpass to check on the PCD,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing.I called HDB last week. The officer said if Jan HdB rec'd keys  HDB will need 2-3 mths to prepare and release the keys. 😰Everytime I called with same question the answers always varies.  No SOP.,btohqsg
I see. Thank you. I had also just subscribed to HDB news alert.,btohqsg
Waterway Sunrise 1 getting keys tomorrow,btohqsg
Is yr block already TOP issued?,btohqsg
I went there yesterday. The remaining 4 blocks seems like halfway done. If hdb waits for all the blocks to complete before delivering the keys then it may take long.,btohqsg
Including the rental  block?Thot they issued by completed block,btohqsg
Yes includes the 2 463 blocks. Im not sure how hdb issues the keys. If based on completed blocks then they shd have started issuing this year.,btohqsg
Hi  did u have to wait long for ur keys after building completion?,btohqsg
From the pics i see  if i m not wrong  is the Waterway Sunrise 100% completed?,btohqsg
Not so. Only first 2 blocks,btohqsg
So it means that we can move in  even when it is not 100% completed  rite? This is what i m getting at.,btohqsg
As long as hdb release the keys to your unit  it's 100% completed and tested,btohqsg
FYI EHG can only be used to pay for the cost of the house  stamp duty levies can only be paid via cash or via OA funds before EHG grant. So you have to make sure your OA funds have at least $6.6k if you are getting a $400k house if you want to pay via CPF fully,btohqsg
6.6k is for stamp fees levies etc?,btohqsg
Stamp duty cost is dependent on the price of your house  can calculate with the below website. the more expensive your flat is  the more expensive stamp levy as per below its calculate with percentage of the house price• First $180 000: 1%• Next $180 000: 2%• Next $640 000: 3%• Remaining amount: 4%https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx?target=MSDCalculatorIntroSo even if you get 80k EHG grant  this 80k can only be used to offset the house cost $400k minus 80k. Stamp duty fees will still need to be paid via ur own CPF OA funds or via cashSo in case you are thinking of getting a house before you start working  can’t totally depend on grant amounts ya,btohqsg
@RenitaxxWinstonMindful@sk_warrior2#fernvalegladesJust received email on the updates. It states probable completion to be March 2022  and will need 3 weeks to prepare for residents to move in. Hopefully i can move in before Hari Raya in May 😑,btohqsg

In the same boat. So much for MCPS too  doesn't seem to help,btohqsg
Oh no  mine was unsuccessful. Anyone can help to explain regarding open booking? I saw it stated mid march. How’s the procedure like?,btohqsg
Haven't actually tried it before cos the last time I looked  there were no 4 room units (can't recall if there were any 3 room ones),btohqsg
But from what I understand  it means that in mid march they will release the leftover flats. 1 week for you to look at what's available  before it's open for first come first serve booking.,btohqsg
^ this is based off my memory so take it with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
I see  thank u so much for ur explanation,btohqsg
I did that last Open Booking exercise. IMO its not worth it. Because its legit first come first serve basis to get q number for flat selection.We booked like 7 mins from the moment it released  and our q number was alr in the thousands.By the time my partner and I went to HDB to select flat  only the flexis were left  so we felt like it was a wasted trip 😅,btohqsg
But if you still wouldnt mind trying then honestly no harm bah  just felt kinda shitty to go HDB select flat and get nothing hahaha.,btohqsg
Wah! Alr in thousands?! How many room flat did you apply for?,btohqsg
funny thing is  the Open Booking project we applied for ended up having ONE 4rm unit up for SBF in Nov  so irritating 😂,btohqsg
oh well 😂 leech off our parents it shall be! 🤭,btohqsg
This  must be Yishun right. Hahaa. I tried that too but didnt get. 🙈 And yes  you need to have fast fingers to apply for Open Booking.But no harm trying sis.. maybe theres rizq for you  heh@Audhah,btohqsg
true la  no harm trying. Nothing to lose  literally. Nothing 😂,btohqsg
Thank u so much sister and everyone else. Hopefully those who were rejected today  u will get better queue numbers for the next round. I shall wait for may sbf then,btohqsg
Did anyone apply for SBF for Kallang/Whampoa Towner Crest/Kempas Residence? :),btohqsg
Yes. but is for 2 room flexi,btohqsg
Yes  on the queue to select  3 room flat  but won’t know if by the time my queue the unit still available or not .. * cross finger!,btohqsg

Checked w HDB before. It takes place Twice a year. May and November,btohqsg
I tot only kitchen service yard and toilet comes w tiles?,btohqsg
Oic. When I select the unit it doesn’t come with the option. Maybe cos it’s sale of balance,btohqsg
Yes thats the market rate but its still negotiable.,btohqsg
Thank you guys for the info on sbf and property agent,btohqsg
Anyone knows after submitting HLE renewal  how long more to wait before key  🔑  collection ?,btohqsg
Not yet. Have u gotten urs?,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone have experiece with SBF and can share the process and procedures? Thanks! :),btohqsg
Hi  can i just check if anyone knows for NON-CITIZEN SPOUSE  are we allowed to buy only at non-mature estate  or both mature and non-mature estate?,btohqsg
i emailed hdb to ask about this. the sg citizen spouse is considered a single applicant 😑,btohqsg
I m single too. They specifically told me must be married to Singaporean,btohqsg
That is so sad. Even being married still have conditions. I can't afford to have 2 wives😅,btohqsg
Other than SBF and BTO are they any other exercise for us to apply? I heard there is such thing as OBF. What isit about?,btohqsg
Open Booking is basically  if they have any leftover from SBFs or BTOs they not gonna do ballot anymore  they will release the # of units for booking. It's legit 1st come 1st serve. Once you apply  you get a Q# immediately and a date to go down to HDB for flat selection.if there are 10 four room units  and 20 flexi units released that round  and your Q# is 15  means there's high chance when you go for yout selection appt  only have flexi units left cuz the 10 four room all taken alr.,btohqsg
What I would advise  if you are going for this  is to prepare ALL your info prior to the application being released. Once they release it at 12 midnight  fill in as fast as you can and submit asap to get am earlier Q#. But it's really quite a gamble. My fiance and I submitted barely 7-10mins upon release and our Q# was in the thousands alr.,btohqsg
But that was because we didnt prepare our info beforehand so had to open Singpass here  do this do that  which delayed our submitting of the application.So yup  that's my experience from the last Open Booking exercise in 2021.,btohqsg
Ya i was 15 min into booking SBF and i was over the que by 90 i think. But i still got it thanks to the rejects of the rejects. Plus the area n everything. If i applied for a popular estate  i can wait long long,btohqsg
So i could be prepared for it,btohqsg
they usually announce in advance that they are gonna open the OBF exercise  release on _ date  then if you see and want tp go for it then can prepare your documents before the release date!,btohqsg
15min still can get  congrats! Is it tengah?,btohqsg
Can advise what are the full info required?,btohqsg
