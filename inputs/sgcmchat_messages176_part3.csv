wait till you can afford a car before saying it sucks,btohqsg
the A80 is fucked in itself,btohqsg
"not a proper ""sports car"" in comparison to the R32 and all",btohqsg
that's why it's a fucking boat,btohqsg
the A90 is *the* best Supra,btohqsg
and yet gt car variants dont even use the damn 2jz,btohqsg
the B58 has the most aftermarket support out there for practically any modern car,btohqsg
having been in a few stock and modded B58s,btohqsg
isn't the GR86 just another Subaru then?,btohqsg
considering the power output they make too on a stock block,btohqsg
"or the ""best car ever made"" McLaren F1 just another BMW?",btohqsg
and yet they perfected the fact its for balance and drivability,btohqsg
the tunability on stock internals is beyond what other manufacturers can offer,btohqsg

A80  hardtop  2JZGTE Manual might i add,btohqsg
*the* most desirable option  had period correct TRD and HKS parts,btohqsg

"""Times were different in the 90s and you canâ€™t build a new car today that only appeals to an audience still'bogged downâ€™ by the 90s.You need a modern car that is worthy of being the current flagship sportscar of Toyotaâ€¦ and thatâ€™s exactly what the A90 is today.""",btohqsg
You guys know he said he was 13 right?,btohqsg
