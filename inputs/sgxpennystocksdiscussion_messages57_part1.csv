Anyway capita china trust only give dividend twice a year and now still far from it... so i guess just wait? O,btohqsg
Crct if u check the websites comparing the yield it's misleading as they state it's 12 months trailing yield is around 6%,btohqsg
The issue is they changed the financial period only recently... so the yield was only reflecting 10.5months of financial period,btohqsg
For me I'm just holding it to generate passive income... I'm expecting around 10cents yield so for me yield on cost around 8%,btohqsg
If you're buying to sell... price a little high though,btohqsg

Understood- because I never buy ( follow) from HKSE ...therefore dunno,btohqsg
If u held many years then u should have it,btohqsg
Next week add Pan U - can right..for short / mid term investment?,btohqsg
Zoomed out on PanUnited more than 10 years charts based on monthly interval. Yours should have been bought in the box up period. Actually  from a really long term perspective  now can also see the price have been slowly picking up steam and respecting that uptrend line (2-3 years) which looks good for the longer term. Hope this one turns out good for all the holders in time to come,btohqsg
Thanks ! Likethis must surely add next week,btohqsg
Mystic- so Long ago u still can find out - surely u are trading or broker expert!!,btohqsg
I seldom tell lies ..I say what I buy,btohqsg
Just checking back  want to find what price where most of the liquidity play is at where people were trading this counter.At this price  downside is limited as those Stucked at the higher prices will not bother selling since already held that long and in the CDP freezer.The selling pressure is not much at current prices. Those who sell must be quite desperate. Price need to be higher before the counter become an active one.Haha  I am always on the lookout for this type of counters to position. Position is where you can make the big money.,btohqsg
Likethis- next week add - even 2-3 week add a ‚Äú few pips ‚Äú still can make üòÅ,btohqsg
Even don‚Äôt move - just lock it still won‚Äôt loseüòÇ,btohqsg
I‚Äôm so fortunate to learn from you guys ! Thanks,btohqsg
If add  as long as can hold I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna be a problem.They usually pay decent dividends too.For me  I will just keep in the bag.,btohqsg
Past few sessions I have shared on how to watch PA using Jiutian as reference. When we analyse  we need to take into consideration the market sentiment  the thoughts of BBs & Retailers. Of course we need to know the support n resistance so that you can gauge roughly what most retailers will do. From there you can guess who the buyers or sellers are. Trading is psychological thing. So if your thinking follow the crowds  your chance of huating reduce. Therefore you must overcome the psychological barrier in you which is to have the guts to buy when most ppls scare to buy. Now I'll interpret the chart based on my experience. Fyi  I don't read chart by the book. So don't tell me internet say si mi.,btohqsg
From the chart we can see that 57 is the resistance. The 3 days of closing price at 57. Imho  I consider strong historical price resistance as the one that cannot close above a specific price for few times. I USE CLOSING PRICE. I only consider day high as historical price strong resistance if the price is tested more than once.,btohqsg
So Jiutian 57 is strong resistance. Today it breached the 57 WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT. This is powerful in my opinion. So Jiutian has broke strong resistance today by closing 58. As mention earlier  we should see a long white  candle soon. Why?. Because few small white candle trending up can lead to a long white candle. Today's candle longer but I don't think long enough. When will see long one?. Usually when it broke a strong resistance which is the downtrend trendline for Jiutian.,btohqsg
MACD histogram is turning up. Traded volume haven't reach previous high as shown on the 2 shaded bar on the volume indicator. For Jiutian to hit that volume  usually will have a big move. As I have shared before  to break 2 resistance in a day is not easy. 60 n 62 are resistances. So my guess is Monday it should try to break one resistance first by open gap up at 60. Once clear 62 or 63  it will draw retailers in n generate big volume. If it open below 60  there's a higher possibility that it cannot close above 62 on Monday.,btohqsg
The above is based on how I see. Whether will materialised or not I cannot guarantee because stocks can move anyhow they want. Just take for reference.,btohqsg
There were no new Covid-19 cases detected in Singapore's purpose-built dormitories for the first time since March 28  said MOH.The country also reported no new cases in the community for the third day in a row.https://str.sg/J2syStay in the know:https://t.me/TheStraitsTimes,btohqsg

Time to get out of medical stocks. Be totay out as play will move to other stocks.,btohqsg
In particular  look out for past laggards like Rex. Friday's increasing high volume suggests BBs are already accumulating big amounts.  Its due for the next run up next week.,btohqsg
Beautiful ....standby for uptrend next week.,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt agree with you on this.The global COVID19 is far from over  even if there is vaccine  the minds and perception of individuals have changed going into the future. Everyone will continue to be wary about virus / new viruses and watch overall hygiene and distancing etc. We are creatures of habit and will continue to do what we do after seeing how devastating the impact of COVID19 was.Governments and hospitals will be more prepared next time round even after COVID19 battle is won as they have to stay more prepared for any new viruses that might attack the human race.Investments from government and private sector will continue to pour into medical sector to strengthen them actually.But then  whether current valuation of medical related counters is overvalued / undervalued  that is another topic to discuss about. It‚Äôs up to individual to think .Anyways  if trading the more hyped medical counters  as long as trading from an area of value with a stop loss  I think that is fine. This goes for all stocks if you want to play this game.,btohqsg
Time to rotate to others. Medical stocks will take a break unless there is a big out break  otherw the vaccine prospect will douse the flames.,btohqsg
May i ask if pfizer declare 0.38 dividend means for 1000 shares i get  $380???,btohqsg
Medical stocks can be further defined  medical gears such as ppe  gloves and ventilators to  healthcare or therapeutic medical stocks.,btohqsg
"Ur ""unless there is big outbreak"" refers to Singapore?",btohqsg
The ‚Äúbig outbreak‚Äù he means is still happening worldwide. We can‚Äôt be complacent Just because SG is well controlled.,btohqsg
Of cos  that's y I am wondering was this virus already controlled in the US or Europe,btohqsg
