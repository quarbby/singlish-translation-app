Kia is owned by Hyundai although they do operate with some autonomy and  brand philosophies unique for their product lines.,btohqsg
That said Hyundai bashing is relatively common even myself in the 1990s and early 2000,btohqsg

Also engine endurance is a function of good maintenance and typically when you're over 100-150k an overhaul is at least recommended for that smoother ride,btohqsg

Nea I'll just be a regular user.....but yes car manufacturers shares platforms and engines and it's common you can quickly find out too thanks to Google these days and it's no secret these days and all have their fair share of triumphs and woes,btohqsg
how you drive very important. if you floor it every red light . 50k up lorry already,btohqsg
That's true to an extent but for most drivers just shorten the servicing 🤣 you probably have more damage at cold start vs a well warmed up engine,btohqsg
On those red lines or turbo chargers kicking in......my old car has a mechanism that disabled performance mode when the car has just started in the morning....important enough for them to spend money and time doing so 🤨,btohqsg
But do show your engine the necessary love and most of the time they will love you back 🤣,btohqsg

Fatal accident at Bukit batok ave 5Dear readers I am leveraging on the power of social media to appeal for witnesses of a fatal traffic accident. The details are as below :Date : 28th July 2022Location : Bukit Batok Ave 5 towards Brickland Road Area ( beside Zu-Lin temple Heavy Vehicle carpark)Estimated time : Roughly between 7pm - 7.30pmScene : Black Bike (RSV4 Aprillia - FBJ5070M)& White Mini Bus (Fuso - PC7763E)This accident has claimed my nephew's life. He passed away on 28 July 2022.From what we know  he was riding on a straight road and the driver of the mini bus was making his turn (either to enter the heavy vehicle carpark or making a u-turn).We are humbly appealling for any eye witnesses who were driving/riding on the same road to step forward and share any video recordings of this accident to help with the investigations  and for our family to seek closure with our dreadful loss.Kindly do contact me at90662639(Manje) or87842720(Saiful).If there were any videos taken of the accident after it happened  we would appreciate it if they are not circulated in social media and text messaging platforms. Please do not speculate on this while it is under investigations.Thank you.,btohqsg
