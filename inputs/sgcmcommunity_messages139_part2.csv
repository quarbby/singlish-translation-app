Yea that's what financial experts say and what's wrong earning 9k to drive mazda 3. That's only cause our coe perverted it ü´†ü´†,btohqsg
I remember I when I had to handover my car at AML  carry a lot of stuff back by hand  had to buy plastic bag from the mini coffee shop. Totally no grab at that area damn sad,btohqsg

Any higher our coe  myvi may one day become our luxury. Or it alr is. ü•πü•π,btohqsg
Nothing wrong  but for 9k a month I would treat myself to a BMW 2 series at the very leastFor me I willing to fork 25% of my salary to car installment,btohqsg
Having a car or even a MOTORBIKE is a luxury already sia,btohqsg
If you can afford a Myvi in Singapore  you can afford a nice luxury/sports car in US,btohqsg
Harlo a toyota here is a porche in US,btohqsg
And then in US ppl are like complaining about their monthly installment ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Becoz mostly live paycheck to paycheck.,btohqsg
39k USD is considered expensive alr for a car.,btohqsg
(39k is the price of a Tesla Model 3 now btw),btohqsg
Whereas 39k is 1/3 of our COE paper  and some people have car while living paycheck to paycheck,btohqsg
My friend also funny  bought a Maserati but leftover is barely enough to survive the month HAHA,btohqsg
Already based in the current coe,btohqsg
That's why all buy to impress only. Quality of life also compromise. One thing that's ever gonna stop us is contentment.,btohqsg

2 nights ago was because she say she‚Äôs happy with what she‚Äôs earning right now and don‚Äôt want to be promoted and have more responsibilities,btohqsg
I told her I not going let her leech off me  she can pay for her own food and bills if she think her pay is high enoughI didn‚Äôt work my buuutt off for her to get all the benefits,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt mind leh truthfully speaking,btohqsg
I rather re-marry someone whose ambitious in career and have the same earning power as me (eg my colleague),btohqsg
That's how yall lift each other up to next level right,btohqsg
