Each execution will be aired on live television for the world to see.""@disclosetv",btohqsg
They took and killed american hostages...Gaza is going to end up like syria,btohqsg
Actually it runs deeper  because Iran is involved as well,btohqsg
At least a dozen countries have blood on their hands in this conflict,btohqsg
Turkey and Qatar both contribute funding to Hamas,btohqsg
From Malaysia (The cherry on top)https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/how-malaysia-became-a-training-ground-for-hamas,btohqsg
this channel ‚Äòs commentators are toxic af,btohqsg
This war will be complicated..the most shocking part is Qatar is leading hostage swap with Hamas,btohqsg
The Us did it to Syria and nobody really bothered,btohqsg
cuz the Hamas leader prefers to stay in Qatar which is more conducive,btohqsg
Qatar is talking on behalf of Hamas to swap hostages with Israel,btohqsg
ik but they are residing in Qatar too,btohqsg
"Yea..thats why you realise the US want to control both Iran and Turkey so badly. Because they are both ""transactional"" countries that supply firearms to america",btohqsg
the one that is happy with the war is living in qatar while the citizens suffer. what an ‚Äúamazing‚Äù leader,btohqsg
hamas shld rot in hell for killing thai(s). wtf did the thai(s) do to them even,btohqsg
southeast asia is alr being split apart Malaysia and Indonesia are on the Hamas side Phillipines  Singapore and Thailand are on the israel side,btohqsg
ya  so the ASEAN agreement is bs?,btohqsg
that ‚Äòs why sg is sort of neutral rather than heavily backing,btohqsg
pretty much  i mean..our neighbours been training hamas soldiers literally,btohqsg
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/world/asia/hamas-mossad-malaysia.htmlYou cant tell me malaysia is not enabling hamas,btohqsg
well malaysia wants the war to stop too,btohqsg
Hamas and Malaysia literally had a agreement to let this Senior hamas member learn from malaysia about weapon technology that would later be used in Hamas own attacks,btohqsg
yea  so malaysia is indirectly responsible for this,btohqsg
investing in gaza is a waste of money especially for qatari(s). there ‚Äòs no roi at all. rather  the infrastructures built will be destroyed & they will have to build it again,btohqsg
They say neutrality to end conflict..but instantly choose side,btohqsg
Hamas doesn‚Äôt represent Palestine & the religion that they think they act upon. they make both look like shit,btohqsg
I think they will get repercussions not just from Israel,btohqsg
they deserve it cuz they are done for  no need to hear them giving Muslims a bad name,btohqsg
it is supporting now..but after knowing that malaysia has been sheilding hamas..you cant be sure if they do support hamas,btohqsg
i dont think they think its a bad decision to shield hamas,btohqsg
their economy says otherwise. KL have v cheap hotel rates & ringgit keeps dropping,btohqsg
they literally invited hamas to their capital,btohqsg
that ‚Äòs what they deserve i guess. karma at play. now leaning on China for more support,btohqsg
malaysia have nth much to offer anyways  other than being a cheap hotel supplier for those finding sg too expensive as well,btohqsg
this is what corruption does to a govt..everybody is too money minded and care too little for its people,btohqsg
their Putrajaya city is a waste of money. extremely empty place to live,btohqsg
model city for who to see,btohqsg
its so i can shout to u,btohqsg
I wonder how chaotic the parliament is,btohqsg
More like they don‚Äôt have the funds to support more months,btohqsg

If all goes well  they likely gonna extend,btohqsg
I wonder they are planning to fight with who,btohqsg
