SIM UoL Banking and Finance or Economics and Finance?,btohqsg
wanna focus on the finance sector,btohqsg
i have read that between ANF and ENF  ENF is more quantitative,btohqsg
but im not sure about BNF,btohqsg
let's say i wanna work in a bank,btohqsg
then BNF would be the better choice  since it's more specific?,btohqsg
i was thinking about investment banking,btohqsg
hmm  what would a UoL BNF degree do then,btohqsg
what would be the best options?,btohqsg
Nowadays even non-business/econs graduates enter finance too,btohqsg
Just that studying a finance/banking related degree improves ur chances  but it doesnt guarantee,btohqsg
actually  I'm not even from Singapore  but I'm about to do a UoL degree in another country,btohqsg
though I've read that there is a certain discrimination between private and public degrees in singapore,btohqsg
apology if i sound dumb and this isn't the place for me,btohqsg
are there instances of SIM undergrads attending NUS/NTU masters?,btohqsg
or just from non-big 3 to big 3 in general,btohqsg
and would it be a feasible pathway,btohqsg
Extremely rare or otherwise unheard of,btohqsg
that wouldn't be feasible then  unless i graduate with distinction,btohqsg
Its probably difficult even with distinction,btohqsg
and I'm not even from SG :<,btohqsg
i would gather relevant work experience upon graduation then,btohqsg
perhaps it wouldn't be necessary  depending on my needs,btohqsg
i just graduated finished my A-levels actually  CIE A-levels  not SG A-levels,btohqsg
Ive heard from my HoP from SUSS to NUS Masters,btohqsg
CIE is cambridge international a level,btohqsg
But isn’t it all A level,btohqsg
need to make u n javen proud,btohqsg
Every time I appear he call me noisy,btohqsg
It takes one to recognise another,btohqsg
go for BnF.. after graduate can work smaller boutique firms with smaller deal size  not as prestigious  but still very decent prospectsEnF is just tough+hard to pass modules... you can read the stories on SIM confessions,btohqsg
Ya for this need study BnF then do internships at smaller firms first before applying to bigger banks after graduation,btohqsg
Damnit guys anyone last for oral?,btohqsg
I just found out I’m fking last :”),btohqsg
YOUR OE WILL BE SUPER TIRED,btohqsg
not as bad as i expected tbh,btohqsg
My cher said her latest end time was 7.30pm,btohqsg
And at 7.15pm the last student was still waiting outside,btohqsg
my teacher just told me by 4 oclock shes like dying,btohqsg
"Yes when I was a private candidate:""",btohqsg
i just sit there stare at examiner,btohqsg
I remember last year my oral the examiner got tired of me thinking and decided to finish my sentence,btohqsg
Basic mandarin can get u merit alr for oral,btohqsg
If u target B3 can one,btohqsg
But I still got merit ^,btohqsg
my oral examiner actually spoke in english,btohqsg
he gave up on me lmao,btohqsg
I was the last person last year also,btohqsg
Sad…. I stay in the room with my oral notes until 5.30,btohqsg
Have yall ever gotten a teacher who taught u b4 as ur oral examiner in national exams,btohqsg
