I look forward to a badass program Chris goes 👍🏻👍🏻 and it maxed our life!Always good to do wallet hygiene. No use case  cancel.Why cancel 2 cards though - wallet space? Or just don’t like too many cards.Just saying DBS points pool though  don’t have to cancel DBS Altitude unless your fee waiver doesn’t go through. DBS is unique in that their cards have memory. Cancel DBS Altitdue  DBS points just gone _,btohqsg
Arigatou gozaimashita. Just don't like too many cards,btohqsg
I’d cancel DBS Altitude - but not before I get my miles from my DBS pointsI am inclined to cancel OCBC Titanium if I don’t spend too much on it for large expenses. DBS WWMC might be alright for large online expenses,btohqsg
Any recommended cards on the mkt for travel insurance? Or does most cards these days just exclude all insurances,btohqsg
Which company are you considering buying from?,btohqsg
Does anyone know what is this?,btohqsg
After Amex Highflyer nerf this year  there's not many miles card choices...leaving you with Maybank Visa Infinite.. For cashback  there's a few choices,btohqsg
Hi there  anyone knows what the MCC of Tiktok Shop is? Cheers.,btohqsg
What's a tiktok shop? I'm so out of the loop,btohqsg
Tiktok shop  online shop on Tiktok  merchants sell their goods on there.,btohqsg
I have reason to believe that this might be the one  so likely 5399 if it's actual goods,btohqsg
Yeah physical goods shipped to purchaser.,btohqsg
Hi guys  silly question but is it just me but paying sc credit card will not reflect on the app at all? I was doing a test payment(first time) but the outstanding remain the same. I called hotline and they say its normal. All my other brand cc can check the balance of payment rather easily  is this something unique to sc?,btohqsg
how u pay? Payment will definitely be reflected but may not be immediate.,btohqsg
How you install Kris+ app on iWatch?,btohqsg
The Kris+ app says you get points just by using Apple Pay  which I haven’t tried yet. But since that’s on the phone  was wondering if I use my Apple Watch to Apple Pay  will I still get those Kris+ points on my phone.Guess I’ll just have to experiment,btohqsg
Fast transaction. Not reflecting though but bank say received 😂,btohqsg
It works. Just takes a while to reflect on the transaction history. Give it a few days,btohqsg
Takes one day to reflect (next working day around 9am).,btohqsg
Arigatou gozaimashita. I might cancel OCBC Titanium.,btohqsg
AMEX True Cashback Card likely the best  1.5% cashback. Or else consider using something like CardUp lor  if you value miles at high valuation,btohqsg
Each cards got its own role to play. I have all the card stated except Maybank. On a efficiency perspective I will retain all 5 that I am familiar with.Main day to day card / dine it etc - Citi Rewards + Amaze. If exceed 1k  spill over to HSBC revolution.Online shopping : DBS WWMC + HSBC Revo/ Citi rewards.Group air ticket or Hotel (generally exceed 2k) - DBS AltitudeHome Appliances/shopping - OCBC Titanium,btohqsg
I think I will cancel the OCBC card  after I get the cashback,btohqsg
Yeah ocbc TR seems to be the least utilise card.,btohqsg
I use Maybank for my insurance,btohqsg
Apart from home appliance  I don't foresee much usage on it. And maybe shopping .What perks Maybank has for instance?,btohqsg
I usually use dbs for Insurance for their 3 months installment plan . I value cashflow more.,btohqsg
"I will change my premium to semi annual  then pay with dbs card . So my insurance become ""monthly""",btohqsg
I see  but then will have processing fee？,btohqsg
If cashflow not an issue. 3.33% definite good deal.,btohqsg
Only 3 months don't have interest and no processing fee. Dbs used to offer 12 months for like many years. At least 5-6 years to my memory  then change to 6 months and then now 3 months. *Edit: dbs just change their my preferred payment plan.*,btohqsg
I check on their website  they say have. 3 months: 2%/EIR: 12.08%,btohqsg
Let me take a look  bcos I just applied,btohqsg
My insurance is about $1k plus a month. =(,btohqsg
Holy sht. They just changed it,btohqsg
Bcos I applied it last month.  Gosh. Thanks for highlighting. I need to go re look my payments.,btohqsg
Can look at OCBC Cashflo card or NXT card. Got 1% processing fee,btohqsg
To earn Kris+ miles  you need to use Kris+ app. Within Kris+ app  it links to Apple Pay.It is two different routing paths.1). Kris+ app -> Apple Pay -> Credit card2). Apple watch -> Apple Pay -> Credit card.U need to use camera to scan Kris+ QR code to earn Kris+ miles. There is no camera on iWatch to scan QR code.,btohqsg
Anyone know why got extra 50 cents charges for insurance payment with cardup?,btohqsg
Hi experts  what card do you recommend when paying for travel insurance?,btohqsg
i dont think have card still give miles for travel insurance  but pay fwd use grabpay still give grab point (6 point/$),btohqsg
I think AMEX card if u buy through Amex Chubb,btohqsg
Just wondering  why no one mentioned HSBC Advance and Premier cards when they talk about cashback card. I find them pretty good,btohqsg
If one PR and one foreigner join name to buy property  will they paying 60%?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know why there is ccy fee for SGD transactions on citi CC?,btohqsg
They aren’t good. The only plus is that they are general spending cards  no minimums or categories to meet.,btohqsg
what do you use the HSBC premier for? do share!,btohqsg
See the bottom of page 3https://www.citibank.com.sg/personal-banking/pdf/banking-fees.pdf,btohqsg
