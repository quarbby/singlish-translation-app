The worst supply chain disruption in history - this is why we should continue to bet on the inflation theme and the commodity supercycle . Don’t trust Jerome Powell and Janet Yellen   this inflation cycle is not transitory .Severe bottlenecks that have snarled major ports in the U.S. and Europe through the pandemic are now disrupting operations at a key export hub in China that could last until the end of this month and lead to further rise in ocean freight rates.Yantian International Container Terminals  an operator of terminals at Shenzhen port  was partially closed late last month for a few days after some dockworkers were among those confirmed with Covid amid an outbreak in Guangdong Province. The facility is facing challenges due to efforts by the local authorities to disinfect and enforce quarantine measures that have led to labor shortages.The disruption at the world’s fourth-busiest container port is putting stress on an already fragile global supply chainSource BloombergCredits to Robin Hohttps://www.facebook.com/groups/rhotradingcommunity/permalink/1549895122009250/#HPHTrust#Samudera#Inflationisheretostay,btohqsg
Commodity super cycle has yet to fully take place supposedly,btohqsg

Some form of collection is going on,btohqsg
Have the pie chart for Fortress？,btohqsg
End July maybe..together with the shipping report..,btohqsg
I thinking ofjeepFortress. Problem is when？ 🤔,btohqsg
From a Textbook TA perspective.. when the price hit MA10,btohqsg
We can see that it did bounce off Ma10 previously.. Might follow again,btohqsg
Anyway don't rush to put in money,btohqsg
Money in pocket is loss of 5% per annum due to inflation.. money in stocks...well,btohqsg
Haha...FOMO is pain.. I end up hating myself for the rest of the week if I give in to Fomo,btohqsg
When price hit 0.605  then rush in？,btohqsg
MA10 will be moving upwards in the next few days.. so likely to be able 0.625 by then ?,btohqsg
Turn on moving average on your charts and see,btohqsg
If you are risk adverse.. buy at Ma20.. if you are up for it.. Get at ma10,btohqsg

Good morning Hustlepeople !QOTD“If you are not willing to risk the unusual  you will have to settle for the ordinary.”– Jim Rohn“He who risks and fails can be forgiven. He who never risks and never fails is a failure in his whole being.”– Paul TillichPositivity onwards !As mentioned earlier  I believe the time to risk have come and it has come.
