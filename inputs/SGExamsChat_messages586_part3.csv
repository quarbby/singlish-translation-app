i kinda agree with you! maybe it's a girl thing  but i've never done technical analysis or complicated math to invest or ever done research on any company  and i never will,btohqsg
my mum showed me how to put my extra money in ETFs  and i've been doing  that  and i maybe spend 1 hour on it a year max,btohqsg
if u can do maths  u can roughly understand basic technical analysis,btohqsg
but why? the money is growing well enough without me looking at it,btohqsg
abit contradicting to what u learn about how only hard work pays off but in investing i feel is if u made the right choice and be early  u get paid for it,btohqsg
sometimes is not your fault  it is just u suay and buy into it at the wrong time,btohqsg
but that's the thing. why make any choice  and why do any timing?,btohqsg
i feel like mine is the stupidest thing to do of all. don't make any choice  just buy the whole market  and put pocket money inside regularly. that's really it. super dumb.,btohqsg
which is good enough rdy what,btohqsg
i feel like girls reading this chat and all the guy talk about super complicated stuff will get turned off from even the basic stuff,btohqsg
yes that's my point. i'm just saying it doesn't have to be so complicated as you guys are making it out to be,btohqsg
thats why u should always do your research first,btohqsg
by research i mean google for it,btohqsg
hmm no offence but do u feel like sometimes it's like healthcare?,btohqsg
as in doctors prefer sick people cos they can sell more meds and treatment,btohqsg
prefers poor people who are clueless,btohqsg
yeah i'm just being perverse sry,btohqsg
i think they all dream of an app that can auto issue MC to ppl and charge money  no clinic visit needed haha,btohqsg
Btw I heard that if you keep taking leave MC to go back to mainland you'll have to serve more days of ns,btohqsg
only thing will delay your ord date is DB,btohqsg
I also saw somewhere if you sign on you get scholarship,btohqsg
Are u referring to the saf scholarship,btohqsg
Also like how to improve in bio,btohqsg
The content part is easy but the answering part I struggle in,btohqsg
Relate FR   I think easier said than done  figure out what u don't understand and work from there,btohqsg
did your cher give any feedback?,btohqsg
I mean there's no easy way out ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Nt tho  I did not rlly ask but from doing practice papers I find that sometimes I have that one point that isn't in the answer key and one that Ieft oht,btohqsg
Compared to them in blue chas card lol,btohqsg
So like how to ck my way out of ns,btohqsg
Lol scarly they feel it's normal cause they spend >20 a day,btohqsg
coz if u not in  go in with openmind first,btohqsg
Is ns first or a levels first better,btohqsg
And is there any thing I have to do for deferment for a levels,btohqsg
