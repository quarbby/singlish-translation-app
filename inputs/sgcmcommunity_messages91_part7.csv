I thought he wanna zhng car like siao,btohqsg
bro.. the 60 cents savings per litre not worth all this effort la imho,btohqsg
the savings likely nullified by the extra distance he has to drive in the malaysia reg car and the sg reg car to wherever he does the transfer,btohqsg
and the cost of the malaysia reg car,btohqsg
this is assuming place to park in malaysia is free,btohqsg
and no fines are incurred because of fuel check when crossing the border,btohqsg
and he lives close to one of the two checkpoints,btohqsg
even then  you work out the cost-benefit analysis,btohqsg
how long you need this to work,btohqsg
before you break even or start saving,btohqsg
Sinopec got 25% discount for you my guy,btohqsg
and how are you parking in malaysia,btohqsg
and how much of a difference will it make if you just take your current car over to malaysia  fill 97,btohqsg
probably can cover the difference already,btohqsg
not counting additional costs you incur or fuel wasted in this exercise,btohqsg
you include extra mileage and cost of malaysia car,btohqsg
Bro just get the fuel switch,btohqsg
one day 40 litres x 60 cents = $24,btohqsg
if you factor in car cost and extra fuel burnt,btohqsg
you don't need malaysia reg car for that,btohqsg
im counting if u pump RON 95 vs RON 97  which is only a 60cent difference,btohqsg
you save 22 dollars per trip,btohqsg
but you spend on buying a car in malaysia,btohqsg
you just go in your car pump malaysia 97,btohqsg
Yea can buy car in JB,btohqsg
Wanna be stubborn like the aveo guy sure,btohqsg
and how far u drive a year,btohqsg
What car you drive for grab,btohqsg
That can finish 40l tank everyday,btohqsg
28k a year can buy new car liao bro,btohqsg
pump 97 no need malaysia car,btohqsg
So if never save  u spent $2k+ of petrol per month? ðŸ˜±,btohqsg
All my life taking grab/uber/taxi whatever,btohqsg
I seriously damn curious what car has 80 litres of fuel tank space now ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
The max i ever saw was 55litres,btohqsg
Wahahaha never heard of drivers complain until like this,btohqsg
Eh bro U tell me what make,btohqsg
Dun need tell me model. Sgcarmart has everything,btohqsg
Maybe custom make one.. extend 2nd tank put at spare tyre well..,btohqsg
Your NET SAVINGS by pumping Malaysia 95 over Malaysia 97 by using Malaysia Car and transfering*ASSUMING YOU GET THROUGH CUSTOMS EVERYTIME AND DON'T STAND THERE FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR EVERYTIME AND NEVER KENA SINGAPORE FINE*NET SAVINGS ANNUAL= $4159 OR $11.4 a day,btohqsg
and you can cover up already,btohqsg
and if you claim to have 80L tank,btohqsg
your FC not very good for sure,btohqsg
cause only bigger vans and SUVs or conti sedan have 70 to 80L tank,btohqsg
but no one is asking you to pump sg 95 lah bro,btohqsg
Quite stupid to do phv with conti sedan,btohqsg
the whole push here is to tell you to pump msia 97,btohqsg
you will net off better and have more time to do maybe 1 or 2 more rides compared to what you waste moving 2 cars,btohqsg
brother I do numbers for you alr,btohqsg
this is with this assumption in mind ah,btohqsg
