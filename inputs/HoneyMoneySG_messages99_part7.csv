Maybe I should use UOB absolute card instead. Will try,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website can propose a list of best credit cards to use based on merchant or mcc code. You can try to search using either merchant name  or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg

"Cannot find  just search 8062  8099 or ""parkway shenton"" for example. If paying contactless  look for cards that give bonus benefit for contactless.",btohqsg
note there are cap for higher rewards  so may need to split payment to multiple cards,btohqsg
Have you paid to this clinic using any credit card before?,btohqsg
u already joined to be able to post,btohqsg
Yes. Some are 8099 and 8062. Not sure why the clinic charge diff code,btohqsg
I think the clinic has two different payment terminals. If there are two  you need to visual identify which one use 8099 n let the staff know you would like to use that specify payment terminals that is 8099 to paywave or to pay.,btohqsg
maybe visa and mastercard different mcc,btohqsg
Noted thanks. But Citibank CSR told me 8099 dun hv points. 8062 transactions have Thank you points.,btohqsg
not true  should be the other way,btohqsg
I tot so too. Very blur,btohqsg
dun worry just wait for points to get posted,btohqsg
Personally  i'll suggest SSB  lock in the 10 year 3%ish rate now. rates may not be near the levels we see today and you hold these funds for the long term (with liquidity) anyway.,btohqsg
I just started a regular saving plan in moneybull  there some errors  not too sure who I can contact to guide me?,btohqsg
Ya that‚Äôs why I thinking hard if I want open eSaver or not üòÖ,btohqsg
I think HSBC card was always treated separately as it didn‚Äôt actually go through giro. Previously already not included in the cash back as I had checked before,btohqsg
Can I withdraw RM using ichange card in msia? Will there be any fee?,btohqsg
Btw a stupid question  if I use PPV to top up my card using ezlink app or simplygo app. Will I earn 4 miles per dollar?,btohqsg
Thank you  will foodpanda/grabfood be eligible?,btohqsg
Anyone on HSBC PAPER STATEMENTS still? do they really charge $2 per month for paper statements?,btohqsg
hi  can i check if paying for my insurance premiums using ocbc 365 card will count towards spending requirement for the 360 account?,btohqsg
Please check PPV tnc again. Have to be mobile contactless (GPay/ApplePay/SamsungPay). How you pay foodpanda using mobile contactless?,btohqsg
I have Very Bad News for HSBC Everyday Global Account & Credit Cardshttps://youtu.be/4SIURs2qZG4,btohqsg
Please check OCBC 360 bonus interest credit card spend criteria. Clause 3.3.i. insurance premiums excluded.,btohqsg
ah i see  any possible workards?,btohqsg
So could I confirm also that if the supermarket is a UOB merchant will I be able to get the miles or Cashback instead?,btohqsg
Pay with another card like Maybank Platinum Visa. Or GIRO with HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
oh  im trying to fulfil the spend requirement  not that concerned with getting cashback or miles for the premiums,btohqsg
That's 100k savings and fulfil salary crediting + either 3 giro payment OR spend $500.Unfortunately  this is the last month..,btohqsg
seems Personal Line of Credit falls under Deposit accounts.very leh cheh if miss out on Annual Fee charge on that account if no paper statement sent,btohqsg
no brainer if you already have USD cash on hand.If you only have SGD.. and CONSIDERING changing SGD into USD for US Treasury investments then you have to consider:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/185399https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/185406,btohqsg
Yea I don't have USD.. so I really dunno will the FX and the fees incurred make it worthwhile.,btohqsg
u can ask those who took part in the webull (i think) USD promo.. i think they got burnt by the FX,btohqsg
Moomoo offering some very interesting returns on US treasuries... But I think I'm just going to stick with UOB this month.. and the next I will pump all in cash plus... For the $2.7k interest in 60 days,btohqsg
Hopefully moomoo 6.8% still available by then,btohqsg
Hi  for the HSBC Revo nerf from May2024 (where fast food and groceries no longer 4mpd)  does that mean it's still 4mpd for April's spending? Cos the 9x rewards points will only be credited in May. Tried searching the chat but no direct answers so far. Thank you,btohqsg
Revo after MAY eating in restaurants not affected right ?,btohqsg
Whats a best card to replace grab? To use as a card for helper with low daily limit?,btohqsg
Other than fast food restaurants  not affected,btohqsg
Xnap is affected also  since i recall it is 5814. Fyi,btohqsg
Thx I will only use in restaurants then. My main card is Evo but sometimes need another card as backup,btohqsg
