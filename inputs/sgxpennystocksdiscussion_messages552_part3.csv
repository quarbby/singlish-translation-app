🚀Pika World Update- 14 October 2021🚀🍎Apple: Global Chips Shortage🍏Just as we discussed the long waiting time of the Apple iPhone yesterday  we now receive possible news that Apple is looking to cut its iPhone 13 production for up to 10 million units. The shortage of components had constraint its ability to meet demand on time.The news also affected Apple's suppliers  such as Broadcom and Texas Instruments were impacted. However  Pika World continues to favour the value-play company despite production issues  given an expectation of continued high growth in the service segment of the business.🏀Nike: To buy Now?🏀According to Goldman Sachs  the stocks appears to be a good buy. Since reporting a poor earnings result on 23 September  the stocks had fallen. However  analysts believe that most of the sourcing problems are not permanent and that the company is still likely to fare well compared to its rival  Addidas.Given that Nike does not lag behind the returns of the S&P 500 often  there has been a keen interest that it might outperform in subsequent years. Pika World has not initiated any positions on the counter.⏰S&P 500: A test to Meet💎As the new earnings season arrives  the equity market is likely to wobble if profit estimates are persistently lowered. For example  between 3 September to 8 October  we have seen a fall of 0.8% in third-quarter profit estimates for the S&P 500.The downward revision may become a reality as companies suffer from higher labour costs and labour shortages to meet their sales forecasts. In addition  higher commodity prices do not help to the weakening earnings outlook too.Pika World continues to see any fall as a good accumulation point as supply chain issue while enduring will hopefully recover with time.📮What's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Initial Jobless Claims  which is expected to moderately fell to 319K from 326K in the prior period.The PPI (Mom) for Sept will also arrive. We expect a slight fall to 0.6% from 0.7%. Recall that Pika World sees this as an essential indicator for possible CPI outlook given producers are likely to pass on some costs to consumers to protect ther profit margin better.Various FOMC members are speaking from 10 pm to 1 pm.Crude Oil Inventories is expected to be at 0.14M  a fall from 2.346M at 11 pm.It is 14 October  Thursday  7.15 am in Singapore and 7.15 pm in New York. The stock market has been holding well this week . Pika World wishes all friends a profitable week.,btohqsg
Good morning Hustlepeople Market has been quite kind to since last week. There is always a more opportune time to take more risk and seems like this period could be it. Hope the strong momentum in market continues.Ultimately  you can trade all stocks as long as you have a SL in mind and must stay discipline when it hits it.Vamos!,btohqsg
