✈️Pika World Daily Update – 29 April 2022✈️⛳️Ushering into a new season🛎Timing the market has often been proven to be futile because it is seldom in favour of the odds. While most expect the stock market to still rally in the second half of the year  market participants can’t seem to distance off from the uncertainty concern. The market seems to be in a see-saw mood but a general downward trend. While the market rebound and a good set of result from Apple came in after-hour  the Nasdaq had retraced from its trading high and hopefully we can end the week safely.🏋️Midterm election🔦The equity market historically tends to perform well immediately after the election. Analysts expect the Ukraine conflict will not derail the post-midterm rally this year. One tricky point is that the election comes at a backdrop of the Fed’s hiking cycle. Hence  there is a possibility that the dreamed rally may not materialize fully this year.The best bet might be after the mid-term election unless the control of the House or Senate is not that certain.💈Buy Alphabet? Read on📺The weaker than expected YouTube revenue has pushed investors’ to a new reality on whether the video platform maker can compete in a sea of choices such as TikTok  that is attracting eyeballs away from its channel.Alphabet isn’t waiting on the sideline. It has content on Shorts  a platform that shows videos of up to a minute and has been growing. This eats into the general performance of YouTube performance. The company is also in the early stage of testing on how to monetize the platform as it tries to bridge the gap of a new age of consumers’ preferences.📱TikTok- A disruptor🔍The uprising social media is now a prominent content provider on mobile devices. This poses a serious question on whether Alphabet’s Shorts platform can capture the heart of the younger content creator or potentially pull some crowd from TikTok.The aggressive push of Shorts globally  hitting more than 100 countries with average daily news of more than 30 billion  should give investors some hope that Alphabet will be able to transform its cash-generating YouTube into a new face and an attractive choice to a younger crowd.It is 29 April  Friday  7 am in Singapore and 7 pm in New York. It has been a roller coaster week and Pika World hopes all friends a splendid long weekend ahead!,btohqsg
US Indices and Oilies Bull.Let’s go. Should be a Huatful day.Crypto bouncing too.Let’s go and hopefully all make some $ for the weekend.I’m ready  are you?,btohqsg
Congrats 🎉 those who joined my Dark Horse 🐎 Acesian. $0.016 to yesterday $0.035 which closed $0.033 was the easy double bag that I mentioned could happen.I applaud the new BBs in town for this double bag and invite you to come to Amos Group.Amos group have insider Kyle Shaw buying recently all the $0.20 chips. Hence this forms the base.Also  last round dumping in market was mainly by Danny Lien as he was in need of liquid funds then for his house building and perhaps cashed out $3m from open market .(Also  I believed he lost money investing in the Nickel scam too)However  I have spoken with the Teo family (former founders of Gaylin) and they have no plans to sell the stock and so does Danny.Hence  there is no immediate selling pressure on this one. From my view  not much selling pressure up to $0.40.Since illiquids are starting to be in favour  I hope this post is timely.Chart wise  it looks like it is ready too. Also  I am wondering why ShawKweii bought back. Offer coming? We’ll see.,btohqsg
Many thx for the information  you’re the best,btohqsg
😇 Amos illiquid still but cheap.Illiquid means if buy   must hold. Not ready for trading unless your timing damn zhun and the BBs come right away.,btohqsg
