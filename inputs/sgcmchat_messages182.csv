how bro felt when he said this:‚òùÔ∏èü§ì,btohqsg
i think we all share one thing in common?,btohqsg
our parents hate us buying die-cast cars right?,btohqsg
She got rid of my old die cast many years ago unfortunately..,btohqsg
im cashing out on mini gt bro,btohqsg
Hi nice that you saw my car,btohqsg
i have an mc20 from bbr,btohqsg
Its real carbon fibre on the cars,btohqsg
who has a hw delorean from the back to the future series?,btohqsg
Bro I unbox my cars on SITE,btohqsg
like you dont take the cars out of the box,btohqsg
I tried to break the car,btohqsg
but like the old ones when I was like 9  my dad was dumb to unbox and threw the boxesüò≠,btohqsg
Bro Im trying to break it,btohqsg
lettu whats the nicest car you think you have,btohqsg
feb 12 cars and kopi dempsey hill,btohqsg
u got 21 sgd can borrow,btohqsg
i gave my mom all of my money,btohqsg
eh who let you in my collection wtf,btohqsg
Guys tmr if i go to milennia walk around 4pm do u think there will be some nice cars to shoot?,btohqsg
Usually what time got higher chance of seeing this cars?,btohqsg
Any car meetup or round now,btohqsg
I want to here the revs and pops and bangs haha dempsey morning cant hear,btohqsg
because it is a cultured gathering,btohqsg
in case you kids don't understand why cars&kopi is a chill gathering...,btohqsg
i think he likes pops and bangs,btohqsg
taste is subjective. in this case  get him a covid test kit.,btohqsg
might have lost his sense of taste,btohqsg
even 0808 isn't even close to the heyday,btohqsg
buddy i couldn‚Äôt care less about your opinion.I want to hear pops and bangs.You think that‚Äôs childish of me that‚Äôs your problem not mine.,btohqsg
this dude driving all over singapore lately. Saw him twice on CTE in 2 days. Second time there was a GTR chasing him,btohqsg
the other time at the groc meet when the r35s were driving on the road there were ‚Äúpops and bangs‚Äù,btohqsg
you cant really expect anyone to rev louder cars singapore either,btohqsg
Fr I don't think you can even rev your lambo or later TP come invite you to drink kopi tgt,btohqsg
u obsessed w pops n bangs or wat,btohqsg
dempsey morning meets are meant for enjoying breakfast and meeting familiar faces.. not pops and bangs.. you want those go elsewhere. either way it's highly discouraged and i can safely tell you this p&b thing has fallen out of trend much long agothe only reasonable cars to have such features are basically track/rally cars (of which both are not legal) to keep boost.. i have not seen any car with pop and bang at a meet actually have it serve a proper purpose towards the driving of the car (other than just noise and annoyance),btohqsg
but full loan cs3 and rocco with pops and bangs attracts xmm!!!!!!!!,btohqsg
as mentioned here.. already threading on very very thin ice (even thinner with recent incidents),btohqsg
go zouk see which xmm want you,btohqsg
one with a body count as high as the rocco's transfer count üòÇ,btohqsg
ya no pop and bang ah,btohqsg
happy new year to all my chinese frn,btohqsg
understand ah but not everytime can have bah,btohqsg
I think i misunderstood what i asked.I asked where can i find cars with pops and bangs.Someone else mentioned dempsey hill which im uninterested in‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Understand dempsey hill should not have pops and bangs..,btohqsg
any car can pop and bang,btohqsg
I use my phone add pop pop one,btohqsg
Nice car  nice carplate shitty driver,btohqsg
He cut and cause people to jam brake for no reason sia,btohqsg
‚ÄúDrive it like you stole it‚Äùüëë,btohqsg
@k4geshe call u shitty driver eh,btohqsg
i wouldnt let that slide ngl,btohqsg
Anyone going for Cars and Kopi,btohqsg
can alw use trade plates üåö,btohqsg
no thanks  i have a plate waiting for it,btohqsg
Do you happen to have any pictorial evidence of this cinque,btohqsg
@tw0riahi bro were u the one who sponsored me rokok that day at mw,btohqsg
one day treat u drink back,btohqsg
BROO THIS ONE NT THE ALBUM,btohqsg
WAHH LUCKY I GOT IT THO,btohqsg
Then we were chatting about the concert,btohqsg
Den u told me u smoke like mad,btohqsg
see u at mw again soon,btohqsg
huh the cinque is still in sg,btohqsg
we were talking about it for a good 45 mins,btohqsg
i stg i cant rmb eh,btohqsg
I even know ur real name,btohqsg
which isnt stated on ur telegram,btohqsg
it proves that im the real deal,btohqsg
Are Lamborghini Miuras‚Äô highly sought after,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt realise it was a Miura,btohqsg
Bro Dubai and Monaco are cheat codes,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see Dubais appeal tbf,btohqsg
But the rest feels fake af,btohqsg
standing infront of a whole lot of hypercars feels unreal,btohqsg
owner wont sell off one trust,btohqsg
his senna was supposed to be here,btohqsg
its been here for so long,btohqsg
but it went to the us instead,btohqsg
car culture here is getting stale,btohqsg
he had a blue 599 aswell,btohqsg
yeah the one w the swedish flag,btohqsg
there MIGHT be a huayra revo customer here,btohqsg
license plate placement is gonna be insane,btohqsg
should be on the roads by now,btohqsg
but i guess owner dw drive,btohqsg
if he brings it to mw,btohqsg
cinque owner bring rr to mw lol,btohqsg
dempsey hill meet is gonna go crazy w half of the cars being fd2r civics üî•üî•,btohqsg
Is the jesko LHD or RHD?,btohqsg
is there a chiron in sh,btohqsg
yes one of it is byu one,btohqsg
my tulang merah no flavour bro,btohqsg
Is there any of the holy trinity in sg,btohqsg
sg holy trinity is cs3 rocco and civic,btohqsg
This one fella he owns the p1 and laF,btohqsg
sg holy trinity is fido fixie and e scooter,btohqsg
there were significantly less in recent ones.,btohqsg
But its like seeing a honda accord now,btohqsg
well you have to remember the fact that an Evo has double the depreciation of an FD2R,btohqsg
and even then the FDs are 23k ish nowadays,btohqsg
appreciate every car you meet  and every owner you come across,btohqsg
You can buy a 765lt in like Dubai with the price of a Maccan here bro,btohqsg
unless of course they are infants attracted to loud noises.,btohqsg
Bro that time at the dealer i saw them filming the holy trinity,btohqsg
actl idk if he still in the uk,btohqsg
I‚Äôve never actually seen a Zonda before,btohqsg
Ive seen alot of Huayras but not zondad,btohqsg
supposed to be another huayra here,btohqsg
all the owners are so lame,btohqsg
i mean its also not up to us what they do with the car but,btohqsg
you know its like meant to be driven,btohqsg
you have to factor in the fact that there is a higher likelihood of having your multi-million dollar hypercar being dinged up by other road users,btohqsg
if this was in switzerland or the alps in general  fuck it you'd probably daily a Regera or GT1 Strassenversion,btohqsg
Its quite a big risk too,btohqsg
Idk how some people in sg have a license,btohqsg
Maintenance fees if you drive it often too is gonna be wild,btohqsg
Especially if something breaks on the f40 finding replacements on the market is gonna be hard,btohqsg
i think Ferrari Classiche can help to provide  but yes  original exhausts and parts are getting rarer,btohqsg
then again  you probably wouldn't be legally driving an F40 here anyways,btohqsg
"unless you have a RHD  catted  and for comfort's sake  an ""adjust"" model",btohqsg
its mine im still at the shop trying to get a proper front plate for it sorry  hope the sticker is ok for now,btohqsg
