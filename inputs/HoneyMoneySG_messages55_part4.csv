Hi All  If everyone ever try to use CITI pay all to pay income tax based on your monthly payment amount like set in the GIRO amount instead of paying full amount of income tax?,btohqsg
May I know how much is the fee that Citibank charges when u use Citi Payall to pay income tax?,btohqsg
For HSBC TravelOne card  when would the sign up bonus 20k KF miles equivalent be awarded? From the T&Cs  it indicates it would be awarded within 90 days... but the credit card fee payment (a promotional criteria for eligibility) would presumably come only after that (eg 1 year later?). So how would HSBC know if someone fulfils the eligibility criteria for the reward?,btohqsg
Credit card fee happens within the first month u get it,btohqsg
First year isn't waived  so you'll get the bill for the first annual fee shortly after ur card is approved,btohqsg
This guide helps to answer your question.. Basically you can't use CITI payall as if like giro payment,btohqsg
Can set to recurring every month. Only thing is you need to make sure you payment goes to IRAS before the deduction date every month  ie 6th of the month.One thing I am not sure though is the current 2.2 miles promo ends 20 Aug 2023. So for citi payall set up before that  do the payouts which happen after Aug 2023 get the 2.2 bonus miles too?,btohqsg
Is the ~2% fx spread worth the miles on amaze+uob lady‚Äôs?,btohqsg
Hi if I use xnap + uob lady card  any miles clocked?,btohqsg
total rewards:- 6mpd (uob lady) + 0.5% (instarem)1 mile assume 1.25% cashback6mpd = 7.5% cashback7.5% + 0.5% - 2% = still positive,btohqsg
Hi. May I know which card is the best for miles if I want to clock above $1k purchase  excluding UOB lady solitaire ($3k),btohqsg
new users won‚Äôt benefit from this right? i‚Äôm trying to figure a way to earn miles with my monthly payment,btohqsg
New or old doesn't matter. New users  ie never use citi payall before gets a further $50 grab voucher. But pls note that to be entitled for the 2.2 miles you need to charge minimum of $8K to citi payall to the same card before 20 Aug 2023,btohqsg
if my monthly income tax is about $1k+  can i pay iras in advance? meaning i pay about 7/8 months worth to qualify for payall promo? if not i‚Äôve nth else to pay using payall üòï,btohqsg
thanks! i‚Äôll explore this method now and figure out how i can pay in advance. don‚Äôt have much time left till end aug üòÇ,btohqsg
I think only 0.4miles right if it's for hawker payment?,btohqsg
would that not fall under dining? unless hawker mcc code different,btohqsg
Hawker never try before. First time pairing it,btohqsg
If i did not choose dining as one of the categories then I assume it still at least 0.4 right? Can't use citi reward + xnap since it's excluded since wallet payment.,btohqsg
