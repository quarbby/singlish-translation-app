As mentioned prior  will take opportunity to sell during the spike after strong set of results was announced.ISO indeed broke year high and hit $0.071 then after which the flush came fast enough  flushing back to $0.062 just the following day.A reminder to ourselves.Based on past  perhaps 99% accurate?“Every spike should be a sell”“If Miss chance to sell  get ready to lose or be prepared to hold the bag”Once we have the above mentality  I think we can perform better in our trading.Anyways  always DYODD  OSOD when it comes to TP/SL.,btohqsg

Just a reminder SMI Vantage will be delisted on 2nd Sept 2024.Which means after 2nd Sept   SMI shareholders will not be able to sell off your shares already and will be holding shares in a delisted stock.It’s a hard decision to make as the losses sustained from such a drop would have been quite significant. This happened too fast and sudden and caught many off guard.From my understanding  once delisted  the only way for SMI shareholder to get back money would be- SMI management offering to buy back shares at an agreed price per share so they may privatise- SMI perhaps getting an external investment/acquisition or miracle turnaround in a big way  bringing its market value to over $40m and then re-apply for a listing status etc.If they don’t do any of the above  they remain a delisted counter (not sure how long a counter may be termed as delisted too)Anyways IF during the delisted period  SMI decides to issue div  shareholders would be entitled too.(Unlikely though)Tough decision,btohqsg
gone case la....dont dream of coming back,btohqsg
Yup I almost bought back at $0.02x right before the announcement 📣 I think . Thankfully hesitated too .Lucky cut earlier ✂️ and was more disciplined recently,btohqsg
Nope   don’t think there would be any .,btohqsg
If They want to come back   will need to get big investor to come in support their business and then acquire other businesses from what I see,btohqsg

But if they have total 90% can privatised,btohqsg
If have 75% but less than 90% is delisted,btohqsg
Something along this line. Anyone who is sure can enlighten so this who have can make the decision,btohqsg
Yup  but still not there.. so they as major main shareholder  they can delist  but not privatise... But by then dunno the dividend how also,btohqsg
Now remaining 20% de can still go in lim kopi,btohqsg
Dun think ah goh will be generous to offer again.. at most declare lower dividend.. and wait them pekcek and hire lawyer offer to goh low price...,btohqsg
Those older Sgx players will likely remember   Aztech had a very interesting delisting story in 2017 where I believe almost all the minority shareholders rejected the exit offer $0.42 as it was a very ‘low ball’ one.But  they still manage to delist it with 73.26% acceptancesSource:https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/aztech-receives-exit-offer-42-centsshare-proposed-voluntary-delistinghttps://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/acceptances-aztech-exit-offer-reach-7326,btohqsg
