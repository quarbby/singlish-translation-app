OCBC 360Salary + save + spend,btohqsg
Hi community  I wanted to ask a question about investing in US stock.For growth US stocks that don‚Äôt pay dividends like ALPHABET. Does the 30% withholding tax still apply?As I read somewhere it‚Äôs for dividend paying stock only - but wanted to check with this community.Thank you,btohqsg
Actually  Alphabet just declared a dividend. But yes  the 30% withholding tax does apply to this dividend. For capital gains when you sell  that is not subject to US tax if you are resident in Singapore.,btohqsg
Thanks for the clarification and for non paying dividend stock does it apply?,btohqsg
The withholding is on the dividends only. So  if there is no dividends  there is no withholding tax. But US stocks are subject to US estate duty at a whopping rate of 40%. You get an exclusion of USD 60k  so either keep your portfolio below that  or explore more efficient holding structures.,btohqsg
Hi Good Morning everyone üòÄ  Anyone knows how to sync credit card billing period to colander month? Basically  I'm checking is it possible to pay the credit card bill every 30th of the month  as it's easy to track.,btohqsg
Depends on which bank  most can just call in and ask cso to change.,btohqsg
Received the interest but didn‚Äôt get the salary portion‚Ä¶. Definitely in from my employer on 30 April. Guess I need to appeal? With payslip?,btohqsg
Happened to me before....The salary must be via GIRO.Cannot be paynow or other methods like bank transfer,btohqsg
Yea pls do and see what happened and how to fix it,btohqsg
It worked previously. Just that my employer wants to pay on the very last day of the month. Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the issue.,btohqsg
Guess you gonna find out with OCBC,btohqsg
Hi  if i purchase online thru klook using amaze/citi  will it count as online purchase?,btohqsg
Klook is travel  excluded by citi rewards. Amaze won't help you in the case. Online travel is still excluded.,btohqsg
You can buy Klook vouchers from Heymax or SHopback and use it for your purchase to bypass the travel MCC. But read the tncs to see if the vouchers can be used for your purchase on Klook.,btohqsg
What is the monthly cap on miles for the Citi prestige card?,btohqsg
I also received on 30 April. No issue,btohqsg
Prestige is not specialised card  no monthly cap ba,btohqsg
Oh thanks! Will look into that,btohqsg
My employer used ‚ÄúPayment/Transfer‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúGIRO‚Äù in April. Now how to explain this to a Chatbot to our outsourced HR overseas?  The nice thing is that it‚Äôs all online and they allow us to credit to up to 5 bank accounts.,btohqsg
I have DBS Yuu Amex since December last year  and added it into Google Pay and use tap and go to pay. It's been working like that for the past 6 months or so.So what is this new feature that they have added now  I'm missing?(I enrolled for the promo nevertheless),btohqsg
Hello every1  Gerry here. There is another chat Webull. I'm added there. Is that spam chat or? Shld I leave. I'm a newbie. Pls help n guide me along. Thank u in advance,btohqsg
Is anyone able to get Max miles when buying Singapore air tix? My last 2 SIA purchases didn't get while my klook purchases went through fine.,btohqsg
Might be a scram since you are added in.,btohqsg
Hi all  can CIMB word Mastercard still link up with Instarem Amaze for overseas spending?,btohqsg
What does it say? It says I am not member when message was posted.,btohqsg
OCBC is appealing for me.  Checking with employer if April‚Äôs transfer was a 1-off or whether it‚Äôs permanent.,btohqsg
Amex pay. Cos want to use in place of xnap,btohqsg
Does uob prvi card earn rewards on simplygo by using physical tapping or have to be contactless,btohqsg
PRVI doesnt distinguish contactless  personally used PRVI MC and got miles for it (the $5 blocks hurts quite abit tho  Visa wins on this one due to how Simplygo is transacted),btohqsg
What's the benefit of buying the voucher here? Can clock kf miles?,btohqsg
Fake one. No new challenges showing,btohqsg
