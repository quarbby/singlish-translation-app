if you're a foreigner  banks will use your passport number to report credit info. you need to write into cbs to merge your profiles  as there is likely a duplicate cbs profile under your passport number instead,btohqsg
Hi  can I check how long does it take for a credit card application to approved? I just applied last night and was wondering  typically how long would the process take,btohqsg
topup finally come liao ! suppose to be by 31jul ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I received this sms.Thanks for registering for our July EGA Bonus Interest promotion! Here's a reminder that your incremental average SGD balances in your Everyday Global Account can receive interest of up to 3.60% p.a. For more info  visit HSBC SG Website > Banking > Everyday Global Account > Additional information. T&Cs apply. SGD deposits are insured up to S$100K by SDIC.Only increment for 3.6%? I thought increment for the additional 1%? Then all the total are 3.6%?I have $17k for July and $150k for Aug. So for Aug  I will have 150k -3.6% + $133k for additional 1%?,btohqsg
Reference Month = June 2024 ADBIncremental = July - June ADBIncremental = August - June ADB,btohqsg
August increment base on June? Not July?,btohqsg
I feel that EGA very confusing and difficult to monitor. ðŸ˜¢ I shift my ocbc 360 in order can reset to 100k for next month,btohqsg
want the highest rates  must do the most work,btohqsg
I register may-june : June $48kJuly - aug:July -$17kAug -$150kSo July I won't get 3.6%?Aug I only get $150-$48k for the 3.6%? Not base on Aug-july for the incremental?,btohqsg
I plan plan till I very confuseðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
your msg make me very confused.. i not sure what u mean,btohqsg
I locked up in OCBC 3.5% for 88 days  no need to think about it,btohqsg
If you had $48k ADB for JuneAnd you registered in July for the promoJuly = $17k ADBAugust = $150k ADByou will only get 3.6% p.a. each month on the incremental above $48k.,btohqsg
easy but you lose out 1.1% p.a. compared to an account which have to do work,btohqsg
Oh no..:( after I clear end aug  when can I join the next (provided got promo)?,btohqsg
Does anyone know how I get can 60K miles for sining up the Stanchart Journey card?,btohqsg
you can only join HSBC promo when you are not in any cycle.If you enrol for July/August promo  you can only join again in September/October BUT that is unwise since your september balance would earn very little interest as your August MAB is used as reference month.What most people do is:1. rotate 2 humans but i think u don't have2. rest one month. Meaning if you take part in July/August promo  September keep your HSBC empty  and do not do anything. October then you register for October/November promo since your reference month September would be very low MAB.,btohqsg
1 working day for approval. 4 working days to receive the physical card (may differ due to SINGPOST postal/shipping manpower etc),btohqsg
So for your 2  is it something like this Sep - 2k (min balance)   1 Oct (Max amount $x in)   1 Nov draw out $x and then put in max amount $x back in on the same day / a higher $y)? Then 1 Dec draw out everything again leaving 2k balance and have it as the empty month ?,btohqsg
the additional 1.1% is up to $360k only and only for one month  right?,btohqsg
So how do you do it for 2. ?,btohqsg
the additional 1% (no such thing as 1.1%) is for MONTH on MONTH incremental balance.. not related to the 3.6% at all..separate components,btohqsg
you literally said I lose out on additional 1.1%. My point is for me it's too troublesome to get,btohqsg
Reference Month = September. Keep $2k.October = Maximum amountNovember = Maximum amountDecember = Drop back to $2kJanuary sign up againYou can earn 3.6% + 1% in OctoberYou can only earn 3.6%  no 1% in November,btohqsg
oh sorry... yes you lost 1.1% COMPARED to your OCBCand no.. if you do it correct  you can get 4.6% p.a. EVERY MONTH for HSBC EGA  but you need 2 accounts and do work (no free lunch).so it is up to you if you want to earn 30% more interest or just convenient take 3.5% p.a.,btohqsg
prior to OCBC  I was at Standard Chartered for three months at 3.5%. I just move around the banks.,btohqsg
Ok thanks for sharing. For all months   need to do +2 k in and 5 transactions ? This is for the giro 1% cashback...and is independent? Nothing to do with your 3.6% or 3.6% + 1% ?,btohqsg
yup... if you want simplicity and ease  then have to stick to the 3.x% accounts.4%+ accounts need to do more work,btohqsg
yes $360k per pair of humans you have. You need 2 humans to get full 4.6% p.a. on $360k.It can scale. If you have 4 humans  you can get $720k earning 4.6% p.a.,btohqsg
what's the minimum age to open an EGA account?,btohqsg
correct. HSBC EGA got a few components as I stated here:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/216218Definitely one of the most complex savings accounts out there  but I would say if you understand and got used to it  it is the most rewarding.,btohqsg
So just transfer in 2004Out 2k1111Then 4.6% right?,btohqsg
18 can liao.. this one has no credit card,btohqsg
Out 2k and   $1 4 times,btohqsg
this will qualify you for the 1% incremental bonus and the 1% Giro/Card program (known as Everyday Rewards Program).The 3.x% is another program.But you can be on both at the same time,btohqsg
Oh the out 2k is counted as one transaction ..,btohqsg
U can find in YouTube honey money call as ding dong strategy. Lolx,btohqsg
And the best way to learn is to actually try it out.. make small mistakes then you will learn from it and be more careful.,btohqsg
Means in the empty month with 2k  the cashback can still go on business as usual   correct ?,btohqsg
as long as you meet the TNC of the 1% cashback program,btohqsg
Hi all   how long does it take to for yuu to deposit the bonus points ? And how will the bonus description be ?,btohqsg
On that note  to minimise activity inside  do you transfer in $ each time just before the egiro payment is due or just keep a sum of money inside to clear all bills due for that month ? For the everyday rewards program (1% giro program),btohqsg
whichever method works best for u..won't be the same for everyone because different banks debit different timings later people follow and miss they blame u,btohqsg
for me I transfer in the date of the payment itself...so far have never gotten the date wrong but need to be very aware when each bank deducts.,btohqsg
Just as you spoke  Citibank emailed me ðŸ˜‚ thank you though! Been great help :),btohqsg
So you transfer in $ on the payment due date and so far ok ? Regardless any day of the week & working / non-working day ?,btohqsg
You can download the app and use the virtual card. Happy spending ðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
Hi guys. Moomoo newbie here. What does it mean that my net assets are 148.88 but i'm only allowed to withdraw 82.49?,btohqsg
yes for me. so far the deduction date is on a weekday,btohqsg
you have a USD100 debit balance,btohqsg
