thanks boi... a bit more and finally NUS can claim me,btohqsg
I know i may sound like a boomer but such things really do happen in the working world,btohqsg
I know haha  like I didn't believe it as a student,btohqsg
Same  i didn‚Äôt till i see it with my own eyes. Ive been in your shoes too,btohqsg
So i kinda unds your situation and mood,btohqsg
But trust me  it helps you in the future,btohqsg
You have a Masters/PhD  but if your attitude is those like ‚Äúthis one not under my scope i dw do‚Äù most people wouldn‚Äôt wanna hire you,btohqsg
thanks:)) plus tbh I love the kids a lot lol  and they also made me consider a future in drama education since I'm majoring in Theatre,btohqsg
Take everything as a learning opportunity!,btohqsg
Not a shit that you‚Äôve been tasked to do,btohqsg
yep!! the underpaying sucks but being there and understudying a senior management personnel,btohqsg
maybe I just pretend it's a low pay internshipü§£,btohqsg
Experience is something money can‚Äôt buy,btohqsg
Just gotta make the best out of it,btohqsg
I remember being a payroll intern back then. $600/mth,btohqsg
what did they make you do,btohqsg
I was working at raffles place  expensive food,btohqsg
Liaise with CPF IRAS and other agencies,btohqsg
I just take as learning experience,btohqsg
I didnt kpkb i just do. And i was rewarded with experience,btohqsg
And now in my current job  im armed with such experiences and i know what to avoid,btohqsg
Hahahah nice... yea the experience is invaluable tbh.,btohqsg
Like  my job really allows me to do a lot of things. Handling conflicts and crises between children  conducting lessons and classroom management  handling a space and knowing a bunch of SOPs and things,btohqsg
I'm thinking of transferring to Yale after Y1 in NUS,btohqsg
wowwww you can do it!!! :DD,btohqsg
thanks natalie!!! I really want it so much haha  like I'm alright with staying in NUS and I'm grateful that I even have a place  but Yale offers so much more opportunity to develop as a theatre/acting student and it would be a dream come true if I can have access to those resources,btohqsg
so I guess I'll give it a shot,btohqsg

Yea we prob ain't getting HBL anytime soon,btohqsg
Yea it does have an impact- decreased sleep deprivation,btohqsg
unless it reaches breaking point then we wont i guess,btohqsg
and most of the student population would be vaccinated,btohqsg
doesn't mean we immune to covid tho,btohqsg
the government considered that rationale tho,btohqsg
I think HBL will happen only when there's school based spread,btohqsg
they shld just close the schools,btohqsg
it will ultimately reach breaking point,btohqsg
its js a matter of when,btohqsg
its actually convenient and easier for me,btohqsg
very hard to tell  but normally is read glassdoor/google reviews  google search for related news  look at length of tenure on linkedIn.also  bigger size company less likey to take on multiple roles,btohqsg
not gonna gaslight u  everything u experienced is valid... but really suggest u to ride out the remaining weeks bcus 3 weeks+ job don't hold much weight.. so ur experience & accomplishment may be heavily discounted,btohqsg
Better read through the contract and look at termination clauses,btohqsg
Doing work that's not within JD is actually pretty common,btohqsg
"Usually JD will mention things like ""assist with other tasks related to business operations""",btohqsg
Guys  my friend accidentally released his ic and address to what seem to be a scammer on the phone  what repercussions is he likely to expect?,btohqsg
I'm looking at my contract now,btohqsg
@mion6091in the event that my contract does not include info about my scope of work,btohqsg
will the MyCareersFuture or LinkedIn description serve as the legal job scope?,btohqsg
Because my job description is this,btohqsg
"last one is ""Delivery of *SCC name* curriculum""and that's it. No administrative extras or anything",btohqsg
