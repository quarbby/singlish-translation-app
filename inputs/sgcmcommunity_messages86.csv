https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGNB17UQRiQthis one considered indian rock also?@anwo252,btohqsg
just did tyre worm at AL tyres for $10.,btohqsg
just drive in or need to make appt? Thanks,btohqsg
most of the time can js drive in,btohqsg
they don’t expect u make appointment for a ‘emergency’,btohqsg
Some petrol kiosk also can help,btohqsg
But last round I went  because there is no need to do tyre worming  they help me to remove the nail  and din charge me a cent,btohqsg
remove nail liao no need patch?,btohqsg
probably never poke through the tyre,btohqsg
kena nail change all 4 tyres better,btohqsg
and it was 6plus in the evening,btohqsg
But $15  I will also pay,btohqsg
As long as they fix the tyre,btohqsg
So…I’ve never patched a tyre before 🤣,btohqsg
I’ve always changed all 4 when I get a puncture,btohqsg
BUT…it’s because the only time I got punctures are in Indonesia..and when there’s 1 nail  there’s 7 others in the other tyres 🤣,btohqsg
That one I will also change all,btohqsg
The kind where you stop you get robbed  so this.,btohqsg
changed out the re004 cos only 40% thread left,btohqsg
when ur wheels not even touching the floor,btohqsg
cos it was a random tire shop,btohqsg
i like re71rs but i think overkill,btohqsg
stick to potenza sport or re004,btohqsg
i think its best for the roads,btohqsg
Get potenza sport...price not much different from re004,btohqsg
some cars have small rims  potenza sport no size,btohqsg
but size dont matter  only the personality,btohqsg
the pilots were cos nothing else in stock lolol,btohqsg
HAHAHA i have 2 one 19 one 15,btohqsg
19 are on primacy tires from factory,btohqsg
changing to PS4 SUV when the time comes,btohqsg
i know u are not gonna like what i gna say cos u bridgestone fan,btohqsg
its like do you want a prius or GT3 on nurburgring,btohqsg
but that one is legit overkill,btohqsg
but all this tyres so shitty,btohqsg
Unless you’re on runflats … then… GG,btohqsg
Only patch I dare to do is,btohqsg
He practicing to be a dad liao,btohqsg
That's bad even for a dad joke,btohqsg
….. been reading dad joke books,btohqsg
To defend myself against dads who try on me. 😒,btohqsg
Hmm  need to check. Don't think so,btohqsg
"Also my car doesn't equip the ""live""  tyre pressure monitor",btohqsg
The dad jokes seems natural to you somehow… 🤔,btohqsg
I get it used on me too much,btohqsg
Same. Why would anyone want to monitor tyre pressures.,btohqsg
Should be lor just drive fast maybe air will go back into the tyre,btohqsg
The air will go inside the wheel,btohqsg
Bravo!! Amazing illustration it just makes sense,btohqsg
When you feel the right psi inside just slow down!!,btohqsg
Thanks all for the sharing  thoughts and views on my queries on EV. I am much better informed. The current COE is still too high for my comfort. the wait till end 2025 might just be nice for me as the EV infra continues to improve. Have a great Sunday ahead everyone!,btohqsg
completely agree by then can see the COE price and see how to proceed haha,btohqsg
waiting for the other big EV players (chinese or otherwise) to join the market here then prices might be better also,btohqsg
End of 2025 the 45 k rebate might be gone liao,btohqsg
See this byd atto   a 34 k omv car but arf is 0,btohqsg
Arf is 0 is due to the rebate,btohqsg
Look at a Toyota vios that is a 13 k omv car and arf is there,btohqsg
You get the ARF back as well,btohqsg
Best is to look at our national car vezel and it command a 20 k arf,btohqsg
Most ppl buy car use loan and that affect the intreast as well,btohqsg
Snow ball to a lot over 10 years,btohqsg
And u don’t get back all of it,btohqsg
Why are there so many Nissan and Pete now,btohqsg
Or are YOU the real Pete,btohqsg
Next time mine got hole can lend me mah?,btohqsg
Cheap lah  but I’ve never seen anyone fix their own car at the side of the road here before 🤣,btohqsg
Later after I screw in and out many times  my tyres can’t be repaired,btohqsg
Better let the professionals do it,btohqsg
Trust me  tyres stay tight even after multiple thrusts,btohqsg
cant say the same for rubbers,btohqsg
Who can lend me their tyres to try,btohqsg
drove to the shop to change the tyre afterwards HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAA,btohqsg
So u still don’t trust urself,btohqsg
no the nail was too deep,btohqsg
Well  technically those plugs are temporary,btohqsg
The real way to patch a hole is to take it out and stick a patch on the inside,btohqsg
WOW MR AM (aston martin) YOU KNOW ALOT!!!,btohqsg
tf 30% is still alot for a car that doesnt go more than 60kmh on the expressway,btohqsg
oh wait.. anybody feel attacked yet?,btohqsg
I don’t go more than 60.,btohqsg
how much is 60% to you,btohqsg
mine is 30% over legal limit,btohqsg
i dont drive on green wall tyres...,btohqsg
It’s never bald. Just slicks 🤣,btohqsg
So grease monkey friend of mine had a customer come in and complain about metal screeching and grinding noises,btohqsg
wow... can he afford to go to a workshop and diagnose or does he need financial help,btohqsg
because HERE AT#FULLLOANSQUADRON  WE AIM TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS W THE BEST DEAL AND BEST RATES.,btohqsg
Turns out to be a lady driver driving Sydney to Melbourne and had been driving 300km on a flat,btohqsg
oh.... surprised she still has her bumpers and fender lining attached,btohqsg
She thought it was fine and just like the AC…,btohqsg
Where and how can I apply sir?,btohqsg
One day J  E  or R will accidentally delete u,btohqsg
and add me back... so whats the point😂😂😂,btohqsg
Ur credit gets reset to 0 for the most active members,btohqsg

Have one on various types of loans,btohqsg
Waiting for@xunxunxunxunto contribute one I think,btohqsg
I’m a gaijin. What do I know?,btohqsg
I heard accepted articles can get extra brownie points for the monthly giveaway,btohqsg
skali i end up bursting the tyre,btohqsg
You also need that tool to lift car up (to unmount the tyre),btohqsg
I’m not so strong like you boys,btohqsg
That one have lah  come with the car purchase,btohqsg

Anyone know how apply vep to malaysia? I think the website is down :(,btohqsg
Took very long to register. Anyway u don't need it,btohqsg

I saw the signboard at ciq  they said vep not needed,btohqsg
Anyway they can change anytime. Bridge also jam everyday  lazy to go in,btohqsg

Wana go JB just go bah.. Dont worry too much. Best if u can get a friend to guide u along for ur first ride in.,btohqsg
eh i like that bike too,btohqsg
ya at least at JB however they don’t drive like dicks,btohqsg
unlike some Singaporean drivers that we see on a daily basis,btohqsg
so just drive defensive and you will do fine,btohqsg
I feel like at JB they’re crazier but they won’t kp if you drive like that too,btohqsg
Haa  instead I'm more worried to get bullied by 🚓 when they saw you are having a yellow triangle lable over there 😂,btohqsg
Wkwkwkw if they ask you pay kopi money,btohqsg
JB seems more forgiving. I see them giving way most of the time,btohqsg
Just say you’ll pay at the station,btohqsg

malaysia u can signal right to overtake and people will gladly let u pass,btohqsg
Right! Okay I go take beer now.,btohqsg

It's more like they drive fast and are unpredictable at times but they know how to save themselves and not crash into anyone else,btohqsg
The issue is when a new Singaporean driver goes over and doesn't understand this driving style,btohqsg
They don't act entitled and will just give way if you're faster  but don't expect to overtake and then cruise at your speed. There's always someone faster who will come by,btohqsg

Noooo  they're going to take up all the lots close to the lift lobbies,btohqsg
Ok question time  do you think micro hybrids and mild hybrids should be allowed to park in green lots  when all they offer is a slightly more sophisticated start/stop system,btohqsg
And do you think plug in hybrid vehicles should be allowed to use EV charging lots for a long term at places where the EV charger is free. Althey barely need to charge and they leave their car there for a long time blocking off the lot from EV users,btohqsg
Ev charging lot is a charging station not a lot,btohqsg
Green lot is totally redundant now as   only charging lot matter,btohqsg
Even you are ev you park at charging lot without charging is also like this,btohqsg
As in they're charging there but there is no penalty on staying there for a longer time than needed as yet,btohqsg
Because they spend the same time at the place,btohqsg
But their car doesn't need as much time to charge and can still run if it doesn't get to charge,btohqsg
Yes that why needed to have penalty,btohqsg
That have supercharger in mall is just funny if the person leave the car,btohqsg
Best is to have power to tow the car away,btohqsg
Unclamp also got good fee to pay mah,btohqsg
Collect tow fee and realease fee better,btohqsg
The towing fees are:Regular Tow fee: $185.00. Heavy Duty Tow fee: $370.00. Overnight Storage fee: $20.00.,btohqsg
Is the inconvenience that ppl scare,btohqsg
Question  do you think traffic like this is acceptable or should kids learn to walk 1-2 blocks for traffic free pickup,btohqsg
When you have kids u know,btohqsg
Kids should not take PHV at all,btohqsg
My kids are walking around the block so I don’t have to sit in traffic man,btohqsg
I think maybe cause red light district,btohqsg
I did not work hard so I get stuck in traffic for my child,btohqsg
So must die die send/fetch infront of gate,btohqsg
Red light is further down and it’s Singapore..,btohqsg

SGCM going to host a track day for us?,btohqsg
Xbow is nice but doubt will be rd legal here,btohqsg
BAC isn't legal  no reason why xbow would be,btohqsg
it’s just a carbon chassis and wheels,btohqsg
And BAC didn't put it through homologation either,btohqsg
Especially because most buyers will ship over to tracks to drive anyway,btohqsg
