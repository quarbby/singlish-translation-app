actually  guys  reason why now coe demand is outstripping supply is cus we have an increase in population,btohqsg
in terms of just coe being issued,btohqsg
u can't have something growing without the infrastructure to support,btohqsg
aka 6.9m pop white paper and our coe,btohqsg
80k+ should be the new normal now,btohqsg
eh that day who tell me HDB cheap? i go see hdb resale portal jurong west 4 room 888k,btohqsg
Coe will set to rocket in another few years when they run out of future dereg coe to borrow,btohqsg
these few years no dereg mah,btohqsg
They keep borrowing future to tank current,btohqsg
in order for coe to really dip  we need to make drastic changes,btohqsg
Don't borrow  COE gonna rocket even faster,btohqsg
8/9am majority of cars in cbd/office carpark,btohqsg
Yet the roads all congested w cars,btohqsg
when we actually set a limit on cars,btohqsg
its like these ppl dont need to work?,btohqsg
"too much PHV on the roads? or too many ""erm illegal money drivers"" on the road",btohqsg
u know the other day i go see car,btohqsg
the dealer tell me the owner is XX one. this just his 2nd or 3rd car,btohqsg
dun tell me. idw to know.,btohqsg
Numbers still lesser thn provately owned cars,btohqsg
but i think now more cars cus we got more FA and Property agents,btohqsg
They shld start taxing 2nd cars,btohqsg
And ban ppl w no license frm taking loan for ppl w license,btohqsg
Like another covid or tech breakthrough etc,btohqsg
actually before grab/uber  our PHV pop quite low. so now when u say its 82k  means we got maybe 50k taken from the private pool?,btohqsg
recession coe might not come down,btohqsg
dealers will keep it high  now the used car market so rabz,btohqsg
But recession ppl out of job,btohqsg
I think will affect car market,btohqsg
Recession best time to splurge on big purchases,btohqsg
Easier to get high loans w low interest rates,btohqsg
Then hopefully those rich there stock crash on those they invest in hahahahha,btohqsg
Jokes aside but wa coe so ex haiss,btohqsg
Ya during covid the cars so cheap. I rmb I buy Benz s class at 10k depre . Should buy the longest coe 1.,btohqsg
Huh can do that? Not only car owners can take car loan? Means no license can be car owner?,btohqsg
But the car had to be under your name to take loan right? Technically you are the car owner no?,btohqsg
@MG_SMneed to find the right credit company to loan u,btohqsg
Technically u dont need to hold a license to own a car,btohqsg
U need a license to drive n buy coe,btohqsg
It’s ok. I will never buy anything if I cannot afford or not confident I can pay in full. That’s why I like the 40/60 rule. Usually if after a year of payment u cannot afford selling your car should cover the bank loan. It’s a way of protecting ourselves from bank debt during crisis.,btohqsg
A lot of things can be done,btohqsg
Just tht process very long n tedious,btohqsg
If nt how do u think Tommy Goh can park so many cars without COE in his house,btohqsg
Car sharing firms kept buying cars that's why,btohqsg
but many more car owners are renewing coe now than deregistering right,btohqsg
Trade in new car better value thn renewing,btohqsg
7yr old car. No more loan. U wait till 10th yr?,btohqsg
Or u straight cash out ur 7yr old car for a new car?,btohqsg
but that would be if the COE on the 7yr old car is high  so can get back high amount when deregistering?,btohqsg
Why wld u dereg a car when u alrdy finish ur loan,btohqsg
