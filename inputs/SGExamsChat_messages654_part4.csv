depends on the type of courses,btohqsg
I ever interviewed a tutor. I rejected based on the online course on the resume. Some free stuff or something  can't really remember.It felt like the tutor tried too hard to add to resume and red flags went off,btohqsg
idk my teacher say just add,btohqsg
not that it matters. That person can easily find students so doesn't affect generally,btohqsg
cause like it shows that you have initiatives to learn ?,btohqsg
i think as a student  worth to put. That person is middle aged  so different,btohqsg
sure. Mostly I also don't know but I can take a look,btohqsg
i did online course halfway then i didnt complete it ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Better then mine thats for sure,btohqsg
Oh btw just curious for coursera do you need to pay the 50 dollar for it to count,btohqsg
Or dont need pay can just add to the linkedin,btohqsg
looked through. The summary feels off but can't put a finger to it,btohqsg
So you got the cert la,btohqsg
apart from it I think ok,btohqsg
If you didnt get the cert and you put in the linkedin,btohqsg
good enough. Better than mine haha,btohqsg
I was a good for nothing,btohqsg
it's more of when you get older  you need to be more selective of what stuff you include that's relevant,btohqsg
bc by right you should have more experience,btohqsg
I know someone who put PE rep in the linkedin,btohqsg
ya but ur not actually affected right,btohqsg
need to be careful10 yrs experiencevs10 times of 1 yr experience,btohqsg
Actl i got a pic wait,btohqsg
i mean at that point linkedin matters fuck all,btohqsg
fill up for the sake of filling only,btohqsg
10 yrs experience as cashiervs 1 yr experience as cashiernot too much a difference tbh,btohqsg
matcha oi what you saying ðŸ’€,btohqsg
just I dunno what's the point of the summary,btohqsg
you are a student. Wide experience and exposure feels better on first look,btohqsg
ok the summary is very fluff,btohqsg
you don't really need a summary,btohqsg
no one knows what will happen in the future,btohqsg
and you will still lose to people with powerful parental connections no matter what you do,btohqsg
but it doesn't mean you should not do what you are currently doing,btohqsg
some progress are made over generationssome over a single generation,btohqsg
a summary CAN be useful but that's contingent on having stuff to put on it,btohqsg
right now you don't have the experience to do that,btohqsg
"Actually right when they are interviewing you and they say ""Tell me about urself"" what do you say",btohqsg
Is it ur supposed to say a hook,btohqsg
like for me  I'm very lucky my parents don't need me to support them. Yet they supported me big during my educational years.That itself helps a lot.,btohqsg
could go even more negative in the thinking.You may even get years of work experience and eventually work under someone with no experience,btohqsg
it's ok i'll hire yall next time,btohqsg
but like I said  it doesn't mean you should stop what you are doing and èººå¹³,btohqsg
Progress takes time. Some faster some slower.,btohqsg
means just continue and don't think,btohqsg
"you can't stop doing just because you're afraid you're gonna ""fail"" in your own books",btohqsg
another way to put itare u going to stop investing because you scared you may lose money?,btohqsg
or your 3 years of investing experience lost to someone noob who blindly put into Nvidia early and make 1000%,btohqsg
like how people are complaining why cpf gives 4% when Temasek Holdings earn so much more,btohqsg
it's almost petty in a way LOL,btohqsg
