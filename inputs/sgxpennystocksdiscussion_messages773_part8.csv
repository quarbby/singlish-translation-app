ðŸŽ‰Pika World Flash UpdateðŸŽ‰Goodie evening. There has been report floating that UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse for up to $1B.If this is indeed true  it will almost wipe out all of our investment value in CS.This would be another blow to our portfolio . A disorderly collapse of CS would also be worst given that its balance sheet has been said to be more than Lehman Brothers.In any scenario  stay safe friends.,btohqsg
