What questions do they ask you for ur interview,btohqsg
hmm should I copy the answers here and delete the other side?,btohqsg
1) Why do you want to be the CCA President?2) I have 5 candidates for this position  what is unique about you that makes you most suited to this position?3) What are your strengths with respect to this position? How can you contribute to it?4) What are your weaknesses that may make you not able to contribute well?,btohqsg
When replying to any interview  be it CCA or scholarship or any job interview  the general two things you must be aware of are1) Why you  not them? Or... you X factor that makes you stand out2) What can you do for them,btohqsg
inb4 the interviewer has personal beef with ur friend group and rejects u then drops out in the next 2 months,btohqsg
I just ran for exco in poly cca  they asked which animal I wanted to be  as well as how I would react when working with different types of people (in separate questions) on dominating people or people who don't do work.Ultimately I got the VP post.,btohqsg
Back in poly I was an exco for a cca and basically we had to interview our replacements. Legit we just made up questions as we went along I remember asking before what is their favourite at Mcdonalds and if they preferred the toliet paper outwards or inwards,btohqsg
cuz not experienced in it mah,btohqsg
But like legit tho it's just better to let your personality shine through and be light-hearted about it.. we hated those overly robotic and polished answers,btohqsg
Lol the people interviewing me had all their papers with questions on it and giving points for each question. Then they added up together.,btohqsg
We auto removed those who said they like Filet-O-Fish.,btohqsg
I didn't know the role included the job of vetting minutes  submitting proposals 1 month before events and so troublesome stuff,btohqsg
Totally shock me about the effort to put in before running any event,btohqsg
