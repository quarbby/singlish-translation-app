Lmao last time was not intern at all but FYP always forced,btohqsg
I think the next 2 batches after us even unlucky,btohqsg
U need to have a low enough GPA to not qualify,btohqsg
Their one is intern + fypOr intern but max is 2nd lower,btohqsg
HSS forces FYP if u above 3.99 GPA,btohqsg
This one was by College of science not by spms,btohqsg
U only get to choose if u legit are below a certain degree classification,btohqsg
I keep forgetting you are a humans student and not an engineering student,btohqsg
But i think macs one is compulsory fyp,btohqsg
Yea but dunnoe which series. Air or pro,btohqsg
I.e. math and comp sci double major,btohqsg
When you have law in one of your sub components.,btohqsg
Google said macbook air is good for everyday tasks while macbook pro is good for demanding tasks.,btohqsg
i mean you don‚Äôt get the pro if you don‚Äôt need it,btohqsg
the air is plenty for majority,btohqsg
Oh I just realised today is February,btohqsg
Thought mostly is using laptop taking notes,btohqsg
Time to do this 11 more timrs,btohqsg
Yall get to have Group or Inv FYPs rite?,btohqsg
Idk i heard that was a thing,btohqsg
I never had such a choice,btohqsg
I didnt know fyp can be done in grps,btohqsg
So you are doing FYP but lestin isn't?,btohqsg
Does he need to make it up with more 4k mods?,btohqsg
10 wk intern must be done with fyp,btohqsg
20 wk intern can be done with fyp or without,btohqsg
Actually if that's the case can u do a PA?,btohqsg
Ooh shit i forgot need do intern,btohqsg
Pa is the 10 wk intern,btohqsg
Pa can do in special term,btohqsg
I did PA in special term,btohqsg
Thanks dude for the reminder ~,btohqsg
That's how I know CAO takes a long ass time to do the transfer,btohqsg
So are you waiting or doing FYP,btohqsg
ü§£ if I've succeeded into graduation,btohqsg
Currently waiting for the sem that i will be doing fyp,btohqsg
No confuse Spms is eitherPa + fypOrPI,btohqsg
Ya that's the case with most but I ask because some courses put the PI load to MPE,btohqsg
Prays üôè grades will be great..2025 gd year,btohqsg
I think for us the load is also in MPE,btohqsg
In this case your intern is attached to ICC FC load,btohqsg
Think I'll just get a mac air..in case I need to use pencil ‚úèÔ∏è,btohqsg
I doing 3 ICCs this sem,btohqsg
ML4 is fine for yall cus that one is the new revamped vers,btohqsg
Lmao I cannot digest paying almost 100 for an apple mouse!,btohqsg
The only fine one is 7,btohqsg
4 and 6 can go die in a river,btohqsg
Yall dont wanna know how much we ranted in the ml4 focus grp discussion,btohqsg
He will come back nxt yr,btohqsg
My cny was over since first day,btohqsg
My cny ended during reunion dinner(by right not supposed to but  oh well),btohqsg
I'm not collecting hongbao this yr though,btohqsg
Sad grandpa passed away last yr,btohqsg
Sianz I just wanna get dis over with,btohqsg
Graduation Wyatt Si Yan and Lestin tgt still onz rite?,btohqsg
Because you called me Lestin you dont get a cameo,btohqsg
We meet at Hive outside 2026 Convocation,btohqsg
i mean mine kinda depends on my prof feeling i‚Äôm ready to defend,btohqsg
Go to your defense dress in chain mail armour and wield a sword,btohqsg
doesn't matter. What matters it survives 10 hours of battery life without charging. lol,btohqsg
the nightmare of waiting a laptop to charge.,btohqsg
You tell me the defense depends on the prof????,btohqsg
Only Thinkpads were the best options for Engineers. back then. Swappable batteries. why they get rid of them,btohqsg
I thought it was just a date,btohqsg
i mean standard is 4 years like that‚Äôs how long my scholarship is valid for but,btohqsg
if i take an intern leave its technically extended and yet i could work on my research simultaneously if i wanted to,btohqsg
so then my grad would be either same year as you or one year after,btohqsg
Or are u on track right now,btohqsg
also defending in april vs july would change the convocation year,btohqsg
i need to discuss with my prof about the intern thing but i‚Äôm planning to still grad the same year,btohqsg
he says i just need one more project done,btohqsg
Wyatt don't leave me to grad alone in 2026 convocation,btohqsg
our sessions wouldn't even be the same,btohqsg
Doesn't matter i will wait for you for hours if needed,btohqsg
I will do the same for u too bitch so graduate with me 2026 Convocation,btohqsg
not if CAO has a say,btohqsg
Ngl just do it in Y4S1,btohqsg
How about i do you in y4s1,btohqsg
Sure thing i am in NTU then for FYP bb,btohqsg
and ah gong is giving out money this month,btohqsg
guess where it'll all go to,btohqsg
do you know where to find the document that states this?,btohqsg
damn i was digging for you,btohqsg
mostly due to some random university senate policy?,btohqsg
or just a final Pass or Fail results?,btohqsg
just by your company saying pass or fail?,btohqsg
Pass/fail for those matriculating before ay 2023,btohqsg
For those in ay 2023 and onwards  is letter based,btohqsg
would rather Pass/Fail ones. because some company work culture is toxic lol,btohqsg
especially those who like to abuse interns lol.,btohqsg
Hmmm this one should be admin info ba. I know of this because I precheck and personally had my admin soundness check my study plan one,btohqsg
I contacted my CAO admin wayyy before my intern to confirm and liase one,btohqsg
U can try to shoot em an email and ask or there are information sessions,btohqsg
I basically murdered them by asking why they did not approve me doing intern in y2.,btohqsg
Cus by right is done in y3,btohqsg
But i brought forward in y2.,btohqsg
Oh I am even worse... I did it in Y1..,btohqsg
I didn't even have inplace access,btohqsg
I dont even think we are allowed to do it im yr 1 ü•≤,btohqsg
Only if u self sourced it,btohqsg
I had to get them to open it up for me yes.,btohqsg
They locked everything up and basically panicked when I sent them an attachment offer letter,btohqsg
For mine i rmb they were shocked that i did not have any knowledge about an internship briefing,btohqsg
It's in the emails from CAO that they spam us daily,btohqsg
They forgot to include me inside lmao,btohqsg
No like there was an internship briefing that talked about how to apply inplace and stuff like that,btohqsg
Idk i never received it too,btohqsg
I never used inplace to apply so ngl I am unfamiliar with it,btohqsg
But the point i am making is CAO is literally on an island separate from all schools,btohqsg
The funny part is that they are located in an area where no one wld see them,btohqsg
Yeah ik I went there and found my CAO admin there,btohqsg
Nah i read somewhere that intern results only comes out 2-5 months after completion of internship,btohqsg
Oh chey u mean that one?https://entuedu.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/Student/dept/sasd/oas/Shared%20Documents/ExamAndAssessment/Assessment/Release_of_course_results_undergraduate_education.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=mRgkqq,btohqsg
doesnt results in this case mean like the pass/fail results?,btohqsg
you need that to graduate  no?,btohqsg
in this case there's no way i can do a y4s2 and still attend convo,btohqsg
U need your degree audit to show 0 for all to graduate,btohqsg
We are not taking this risk,btohqsg
Your PA/PI/EPI results will be released 2 to 5 months after the end of your internship.,btohqsg
Yeah this was made clear if u ask or attend any CAO workshops,btohqsg
Aint nobody got time for dat,btohqsg
Imo cannot cuz the Academic advisor can drag their feet,btohqsg
Essentially after intern is finish u submit the assessments your academic supervisor can take their own sweet time until the deadline to submit your results,btohqsg
why not graduate with your seniors?,btohqsg
Oh that ship wld have sailed long time ago,btohqsg
Well tbh we can graduate in 3.5 yrs,btohqsg
But like that decision can only be made in yr 1,btohqsg
tfw laptop prices are dropping now,btohqsg
mostly because of new laptop refreshes coming in April.,btohqsg
need to clear out the old stock,btohqsg
I had a delulu guy tell me he wants to graduate in 2.5 years,btohqsg
Yeah  the newer devices are coming out at a much faster now. Laptops  desktop computers & phones as well,btohqsg
I would have been fine with his claims but his calculations factors in FYP at 6months..,btohqsg
Actually tbh he cld have just shift his fyp back by 1 sem...,btohqsg
Not reduce the fyp to 6 months,btohqsg
U need Y4 standing for that,btohqsg
It's literally impossible to hit like 95 AUs in 3 semesters,btohqsg
Yea that wld probably be like an engineering major loaf,btohqsg
Yeah idk how would u convince an admin to willingly give u 32 AUs,btohqsg
If your gpa is very very good,btohqsg
what if i just want to speed run my degree,btohqsg
He's in humanities with me but as a single major,btohqsg
So assuming he maximise each mod overload at 4AU per.. u would have to request for 4 mod overload ONTOP of your normal sem load..,btohqsg
Ouh yea then that is impossible,btohqsg
if from Diploma maybe get credits transfer?tbh  I prefer students have real world experience rather than stuck in Uni too long.,btohqsg
Just double your money what's wrong with that,btohqsg
That will be my third SG group ban,btohqsg
Then i was like Wait irwen is alr here,btohqsg
If irwen is here why is this guy not banned yet,btohqsg
Looks like April is the time to buy newer laptops ..rumours saying airtag 2 might come out,btohqsg
Uhh April Poly start many new students will have to buy laptops as well,btohqsg
So all apple products have discount for students price?,btohqsg
But if u r in no rush to get a new one rn  u can wait until Sept to buy a students discounted one cuz by then new MacBook Airs M4 would‚Äôve dropped and they will come packaged tgt with AirPods,btohqsg
typically I would aim  when apple starts to giveaway AirPods  or Apple Pencils when purchasing MacBook / iPads?,btohqsg
remember to use Apple Education Store to purchase to buy tho,btohqsg
if youre looking for Windows then there will be some available already.But by April new MacBook Airs M4 would've dropped too.,btohqsg
ei ... do we get our accounts in jc,btohqsg
Nvr tried it before in jc,btohqsg
cuz i want to get a macbook pro quickly,btohqsg
But have heard of ppl doing it mostly in uni or poly,btohqsg
as long it ends with some kind of .edu.sg? or what,btohqsg
Well many years ago when I was on sec 1,btohqsg
I managed to get windows server 2008 os (as a student) using school email,btohqsg
So I assuming your email domain need to get recognised by apple education store,btohqsg
If you want drop them a call  Poly typically email address domain for students,btohqsg
Yes the key is legit   no trial,btohqsg
If u student can get it free uh,btohqsg
Technically can be used like desktop os too but not recommended,btohqsg
Check if your school eligible for it first,btohqsg
Nowadays ppl use Windows server 2025 liao,btohqsg
So I assuming it is updated with latest server os as well,btohqsg
Btw I'm a member of the Windows Insider Programme,btohqsg
JC can also. Just sign in using the school email on Unidays onApple.com,btohqsg
If you into computer science then can even download developer grade software and server OS from Microsoft like what I did in secondary 1 üòÇüòÇ I in fact installed active directory services back then   quite thrilling for me,btohqsg
I saw shopee selling airtag for like 34,btohqsg
Ooh yea..does anyone uses clara libra?,btohqsg
Is it a tech bug issue that clara can't seem to sync with overdrive?,btohqsg
Or is the device officially gone ripü™¶?,btohqsg
I have gone insane in a matter of 5 hours :D,btohqsg
But uni is fun guys :D(To any concerned ppl taking A level results),btohqsg
It takes 5 hours to get there?,btohqsg
It is at the physics lab,btohqsg
The 3D printer broke the filament,btohqsg
That machine needs to break down,btohqsg
I need that object for my report :D,btohqsg
And that object is not done yet,btohqsg
Wait why are you in lab,btohqsg
My partner went past the lab but saw the cylinder was not there,btohqsg
So I went to the lab,btohqsg
you don‚Äôt even know what they‚Äôre talking about,btohqsg
And discovered an uncomplete base of a cylinder,btohqsg
This thing takes 3 weeks üò≠,btohqsg
Guess we will be here listening to bedtime üåô üò¥,btohqsg
Is ok i had lab today too,btohqsg
To find out which dna contains g4 structures,btohqsg
I dont know what i was doing,btohqsg
Will u use the dna to clone a sheep,btohqsg
I was just having fun micro pipetting stuff,btohqsg
I only want to clone si yan,btohqsg
he will clone himself so he can sleep,btohqsg
One goes to sch the other sleeps,btohqsg
Because the clone cant reach your level of beauty,btohqsg
Will the clone do your finals for you?,btohqsg
Because either way our intelligence is the same level,btohqsg
Did you just call me stupid,btohqsg
Also I ate expired squid :D,btohqsg
And my hdb vending machine is not on,btohqsg
And I nearly fell down with wet slippers,btohqsg
And i felt pain on the knee where I injured :D,btohqsg
Sorry ive seen rachel before irl,btohqsg
I aint even seen your ass,btohqsg
I thought this is the fun and exciting part about sciecne?,btohqsg
as long it isn't mouth pipet.,btohqsg
I would cat-ch a fish for her,btohqsg
I may not like science as much as i thought then,btohqsg
Just not the correct one :(,btohqsg
But you get to do chemistry like u wanted :D,btohqsg
Where were the times when i can just throw f=ma into questions and get the marks,btohqsg
This physics degree is a bust :(,btohqsg
I dont even see no chemistry... its all biology üò≠,btohqsg
But its ok ill get used to it,btohqsg
Shld have taken soft condensed matter with me üò≠,btohqsg
We learning abt why glass is a liquid :D,btohqsg
sounds like my EEE engineering degree as a whole.,btohqsg
Soft condensed is also a biophysics concentration prereq,btohqsg
I joined physics cus I like math,btohqsg
just substituting numbers into equations until churning out numbers.,btohqsg
as long it's direct and not  Differential Equations. lel,btohqsg
Haze in east side of Singapore last night?,btohqsg
Actually u did. U just didn't know it was me back then,btohqsg
Also what did Rachel do to win your attention irl,btohqsg
She saw me in ntu before,btohqsg
So what u wan me to do? Hunt you down ah,btohqsg
Hunt me down at the next stayc concert,btohqsg
That's assuming we still win the benefits,btohqsg
i will see you this saturday,btohqsg
we could still meet before going into the venue,btohqsg
I have never been to a concert before :D,btohqsg
only go for artists you actually like enough to see irl,btohqsg
I fly to see the artists,btohqsg
But i feel like tickets are hard to get,btohqsg
U joke about that in SG,btohqsg
No i mean buying tickets for concerts in China,btohqsg
Buying tickets takes so much energy üò≠,btohqsg
jokes on me i am not rich enough to have that problem,btohqsg
I just happen to be there,btohqsg
jokes on you i got pulled into this one,btohqsg
but what if i wanted you there,btohqsg

No need ce yan  you need si yan,btohqsg
it wasnt me it was milo,btohqsg

Am attempting to plan materials for H2 Math : Inequalities involving quadratic   cubic and rational functions. Hopefully can be sufficiently good as end product,btohqsg
Ahh like unable to detect ppl in public ?,btohqsg
The number of spam bots is alarming,btohqsg
Hi guys whys my code in red wrong,btohqsg
like you by right could use ‚Äò instead of ‚Äú so if you wanna display it as just a text,btohqsg
you add \ in front of it,btohqsg
"Certainly! Let's analyze the Python code snippet and the error message to pinpoint the issue and provide a solution.Problem:The error message ""SyntaxError: f-string: unmatched '('"" clearly indicates that there's an issue with the parentheses within your f-string. Specifically  the interpreter is finding an unmatched opening parenthesis somewhere in the expression you're trying to format.Code Breakdown:The problematic line is:print(f""((int(input(""What's x?"")))+(int(input(""What's y?""))): )"")Let's dissect it:* print(f"" ... ""): This is an f-string  used for embedding expressions directly within strings.* (( ... ) + ( ... ) :  ): This is the core of the issue. You have multiple nested parentheses  and the colon "":"" and comma "" "" inside the f-string are being misinterpreted due to the unbalanced parentheses.Solution:The fundamental problem is that you're trying to perform addition and then potentially use the result in a format specifier (indicated by the colon "":"") within the f-string. However  you're not doing it correctly.Here's the corrected approach:x = int(input(""What's x? ""))y = int(input(""What's y? ""))result = x + yprint(f""{result}"")Explanation of Correction:* Separate Input and Calculation: We first take the input for x and y as strings and convert them to integers using int(). Then  we calculate the sum and store it in the result variable.* F-string for Output: In the print statement  we use an f-string to directly embed the value of the result variable.  Since we just want to print the value  no further formatting is needed.How to Run in Colab:* Enter Code:  Paste the corrected code into a Colab cell.* Run Cell: Click the ""Play"" button to the left of the cell.* Input: You'll be prompted to enter values for x and y.  Type in the numbers and press Enter after each.* Output: The sum of x and y will be printed as the output.Example Interaction:What's x? 10What's y? 2030Additional Notes:* Error Prevention:  Always try to break down complex operations into smaller  manageable steps. This improves readability and reduces the risk of syntax errors.* Debugging: When you encounter errors  carefully examine the error message and trace it back to the specific line of code. Use print() statements to inspect intermediate values and understand the flow of your program.If you have any more questions or need further assistance  feel free to ask!",btohqsg
you might need to take some notes from certain briefings (subj combi / cca / talks) so its good to have a notebook or PLD! üëçüèª,btohqsg
This is for JC ori is it or?,btohqsg
First day of ori quite normal to see ppl not being social,btohqsg
"as long don't have funny funny ""sexual"" suggestive games i think should be ok lol.",btohqsg
But rither ways still one must take effort to socialise,btohqsg
Also the ori grp you are in for your first day of ori IS NOT YOUR CLASS,btohqsg
Something like that. Just dont overdo it to the point you scar them for their jc life,btohqsg
or just being kicked out of JC.,btohqsg
"And even if you dont get ""friends"" in the end of ori  you can still socialise when you join your class or when you do ccas",btohqsg
Typically the bonds formed after ori are much more stronger than those formed during ori,btohqsg
are CCAs compulsory in JC tho?,btohqsg
if JC has proper funding for clubs to do events ok la.If no money  mostly wasting precious study time only haha,btohqsg
heard last time got JC has water polo?,btohqsg
quite envy that Singapore has so much funding for CCAs,btohqsg
in Malaysia one  mostly pointless meetings since no proper guidance one.,btohqsg
Not a good time for Singapore to be doing this,btohqsg
They brought us to Pulau Ubin last year,btohqsg
Ngl idk why the uniform made me feel like its cosplayingüíÄ,btohqsg
Since I‚Äôm a senior of that CCA I need to plan the Annual camp for the juniors (Sec 1 and 2‚Äôs),btohqsg
After i sec 1 i zao,btohqsg
explains why my Fullerton MMF been so shaky lately.,btohqsg
Especially after being accused of selling Nvidia GPU‚Äôs to China,btohqsg
Now the US is pissed at Singapore,btohqsg
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a sanction comes around quite soon,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs just hope trump doesn‚Äôt do it üíî,btohqsg
but then I feel Trump is going to fuck up Americans real good. haha,btohqsg
But imo I think trumps gonna take this personally,btohqsg
only need to note that day 1 ends at 1545,btohqsg
Day 1 typical is all lectures,btohqsg
All the lectures on subject combis...,btohqsg
i think i end at 1730 bro,btohqsg
How was your day back to the grind in Week 4üòî,btohqsg
some schools like SAJC have math tests until 1630,btohqsg
Selection test on day 1 tf?,btohqsg
At least fmath small batch maybe got chance,btohqsg
I think asr do not have on day 1,btohqsg
the longest activity is college anthem  cheer and break?  1030 to 1300 boring ...,btohqsg
i prefer they start lesson on day 2 üòÅ,btohqsg
anyone here like strong in O level maths?,btohqsg
just ask in the o level math group?,btohqsg
This is just the talk cock chat there's one for hw help for each level,btohqsg
Err holy grail temporarily offline? üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Nvm it is up and running üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Hours ago it was offline you see,btohqsg
Anyone here who want upload to grail go ahead,btohqsg
Lowkey it seems to be the easiest,btohqsg
heard B and G together is crazy,btohqsg
yeah i sat for the tests for X and F,btohqsg
NYJC pulled off some H3 math in the test,btohqsg
Do you want a mock test I set? The FM test closely matches my prediction,btohqsg

Hi can I check..what's the NS enlistment  timeline for 17yo (d.o.b in June)? üôè,btohqsg
When will the pre med screening letter come? Enlistment report dates..etc. on the premise of no intended tertiary education.,btohqsg
not sure  not a common experience amongst many.,btohqsg
hi guys  do y'all know which cafe was this scene filmed?,btohqsg
maybe scroll to the end of the credit scene?,btohqsg
Tbh this one is quite hard to answer because the most we know is JC batch typically enlist arnd Jan to April or May while those from poly is somehwhere btw April to Dec.[may not be true for some who enlist later than expected due to delays in health screening]As for pre medical screening  I think I did mine 11 to 12 months before I enlishested  though some had to stretch it out even further. Wld recommend calling cmpb to ask.,btohqsg
Pretty deadly mostly becus you need to memorise and even digest a lot of info  esp since you put H2 Bio and H2 Geog.However  did have a friend who scored like 80+/90for A levels so he did pretty damn gd but he was from BCMg but the 2019s batch.(our rp scoring was a lil diff),btohqsg
i see i see  so far i put BCmG as my second after BCmEhopefully can get my first choice,btohqsg
tbh he shld have just taken BCMG,btohqsg
Well different ppl strong at different learning style ... if he/she good enjoy memory work and have the ability to handle memory intensive combination  I will encourage him/her to select such subject combination,btohqsg
I have seen ppl in China on tv shows with photographic kind of memory  this kind really suited for memory intensive subjects and courses,btohqsg
U can take 4h2s and if u f up one of them they will just not consider it,btohqsg
If u take 3h2s if u f up one of ur h2s ur cooked,btohqsg
but unis nowadays also have the indicative grade profile right,btohqsg
so can‚Äôt completely throw the subject out of the window also,btohqsg
idt it will matter that much,btohqsg
they will prob change the igp,btohqsg
Is doing leetcode good training for noi?,btohqsg
I mean. I wld suggest a 4h2 uh. But problem is  you need to attain the o level score to get 4h2. Not everyone can just get 4h2 just because they want it,btohqsg
Even if they did choose a 4h2  it still depends on the demand. So it wld be also good to figure out a 2nd choice of subject combinations,btohqsg
Odac seems really fun but 3.5 and 4hrs of cca,btohqsg
I want to ask   how possible is it to study H1/2 economics by ownself ?,btohqsg
Wld say a lot of the camping ppl/uniform grp kinda enjoyed it.,btohqsg
Altho i joined npcc but quit in sec 1,btohqsg
Cus wah the uniform i rly cannot,btohqsg
You can try it out first,btohqsg
But i mean now no workload ofc,btohqsg
Im wondering like later into the year or even j2,btohqsg
But j2 step down in term 2 oni right ,btohqsg
How far is your jc btw from your home?,btohqsg
Odac oso has alot of training like sports cca,btohqsg
Even if home is close also hard if you are exhausted to study,btohqsg
I mean i getss where you are coming from,btohqsg
I technically did have to do a cca with long hour also,btohqsg
But i wld say just try it out first and see if you plan to change,btohqsg
"Is not a ""very"" vigorous cca",btohqsg
But is until like 7pm kind which is very rare for ccas,btohqsg
Odac is like 4 to 730 amd 330 to 730,btohqsg
But latest i saw was arnd 7pm,btohqsg
But i did somewhat enjoy it,btohqsg
I get to meet new ppl,btohqsg
Get to do events that somehow i enjoy,btohqsg
But cannot enjoy until u forget to study lol,btohqsg
And tbh a lot of j1s wld suffer having this feeling when they first receive their mye,btohqsg
Tbh idk if all jcs have,btohqsg
tough lol I got C in H2 econs even with tuition maybe I just suck  but all my other subjs are B/A,btohqsg
But you definitely need discipline and such uh,btohqsg
But then at the same time,btohqsg
Cca is technically the only time you dont think abt a levels,btohqsg
Apparently stem cca they just do hw lol,btohqsg
They still technically chose it because they are interested in it,btohqsg
