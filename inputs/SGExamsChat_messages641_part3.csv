my friends class had 4 retainees bruh,btohqsg
Ok then thinking about it similar to mine,btohqsg
in a class of 25 students they had 4 retainees,btohqsg
and they were estimated to be the best performing class (lol),btohqsg
That’s because she went to ACSi first,btohqsg
Once you enter a JC/ACSi/SJI can’t apply to another Jc via JAE ever again,btohqsg
Which is quite stupid imo  they should at the very least allow IB people to apply to Jc the following year if they want to drop out of IB  and vice versa,btohqsg
But then you can apply to MI during another JAE exercise even if you went to a JC  so I rly don’t get the logic behind this,btohqsg
The JAE portal will just show that you aren’t eligible for JC/SJI/ACSi if you try,btohqsg
If this rule didn’t exist she would’ve have been forced to go to MI. I think she could’ve still individually approached different JCs to ask if she can transfer  but perhaps it was too troublesome or there weren’t any vacancies.,btohqsg
But there was a student in my class who transferred to acjc at the start of term 2 in J1 after she found that the Ib course in ACSi wasn’t for her  I guess it’s because both Acjc and ACSi are related schs so they could make this arrangement,btohqsg
Well I found it out the hard way when I wanted to voluntarily retain but Acjc didn’t let me to cos no vacancies. I thought I could still transfer but unfortunately not lol.,btohqsg
Idk what's the retain rate for tm,btohqsg
But idt it's like that high cuz they legit,btohqsg
Even if like they prolly shldnt,btohqsg
i rmbr my year i think 60% of the cohort got a S or U for h2 physics/chem,btohqsg
its good if ur scoring Us,btohqsg
i rmbr my friend got best improved in cohort for physics,btohqsg
but still improved from U to U,btohqsg
she improved from 5.8 to 29.8,btohqsg
ik someone who purposely fked mye to get good progress award,btohqsg
but its cuz our prelims had practical,btohqsg
also it was a pri sch kid,btohqsg
yes it was back when there was mye,btohqsg
i forgot if its voucher or cash but yeah theres a reward and cert,btohqsg
I mean I got good prog,btohqsg
my school gives out like $50 per award,btohqsg
because my sch dh Edusave  award,btohqsg
Ironically comparable even though we're a 3 year course,btohqsg
Cause if so  HM I got one dumbass friend who keep saying they wanna dropout of MI to take  private As last year,btohqsg
Iestin is the sufferer of ntu physics now,btohqsg
Why am I being dragged into the spotlight U old fat fuck,btohqsg
this didn’t start out with it being anything bad,btohqsg
I will rip your oesophagus out,btohqsg
Please send all assignment answers ty laoda,btohqsg
i’m surprised you can spell oesophagus with your english,btohqsg
does YI offer 2 h2 sciences for comb sci students,btohqsg
You're so close to getting it done and over with,btohqsg
I mean  iirc they counted it as if >67.5  you eligible for local Us,btohqsg
Like that's just a weird stat,btohqsg
i got a1 but like idk if i go YI can do or not,btohqsg
If I was I wouldn't be in ntu physics :'),btohqsg
Y2 makes u wan to kill urself,btohqsg
I wouldn't doubt that  that's just our regular stat for almost every year,btohqsg
The comparison can't even be fair,btohqsg
If there’s one thing gg down is mi grades,btohqsg
We 3 years still get these kind of stat,btohqsg
By logic we suppose to do better,btohqsg
Wah I haven’t get my pw yet,btohqsg
But eh not bad what dailou,btohqsg
