Hello  appreciate if someone can share how long will it take the amount to be reflected in IRAS for payment made via Cardup?P/S: The payment was successfully delivered to Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore on 10/05/2024.TIA 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Has anyone used Enets AXS to clear off a balance transfer? Is the limit $9 999.99 per day or per transaction?14. What is the minimum and maximum amount I can pay through AXS e-Station in a single transaction?The minimum payment amount is determined by the billing organisation/fines agency/telco.For eNETS  the maximum payment amount is either the default set by your card issuing Bank or the daily transaction limit set up by you  up to a limit of $9999.99.,btohqsg
after 3-5 working days should reflected in iras   but the received date will be same as card up payment date.,btohqsg

For 4-6% yield need to take a bit risk  you can try moomoo 6.8% or u can try our SG top 3 bank dividend stocks but pls DYODD,btohqsg
I'm using UOB Evol. For booking of overseas hotel  any website I should use or not use (as online purchase)?,btohqsg
I think the only way is paylah or maybe Atome. Cos even if you use Alipay and linked to your CC  it's even more cos USD,btohqsg
But Atome can still earn cc rewards?,btohqsg
Between getting 2% cashback vs 1.25mpd  which one will you choose?,btohqsg
1.25mpd  but got such card ah? Which card?,btohqsg
Guys and ladies. Any of you open uob kris flyer account. How is your opinion of it?,btohqsg
This account I heard can earn miles.. wonder how true,btohqsg
"Actually I'm not 100% certain about Atome either but it has been mentioned on reddit you can. It's an app link to Atome  so I'm just assuming it won't charge the 3% fees. In any case  they do have fee waiver vouchers under ""Cashback"" in the TB main page",btohqsg
it is true..i roughly looked at it before.. if you have i think $740 of insurance bills PER MONTH  then it is worth itCalculation:$1000 at 4% p.a. interest = $3.33 per month opportunity cost$3.33 of miles earned at 0.3mpd = 3.33*100/1.5/0.3 = $740 of 0.3 mpd spend to earn $3.33 of miles per month,btohqsg
I have used it today and charged to my amaze linked with Maybank F&F  but as I chose full fuel  it overcharged my credit card  shell will refund the remaining amount to my Maybank F&F correct?,btohqsg
think the question is which card gives 1.25mpd,btohqsg
I believe very few people will go for this,btohqsg
if i were to go for study loan  any bank loan that can earn miles? is it worth to loan?,btohqsg
More people will prefer uob ladys account,btohqsg

isn't student loan the interest rate quite high ?,btohqsg
hi would like to ask is it the hsbc revolution still good to apply?? Or any recommended for miles??,btohqsg
U might be better off getting a balance transfer. Cheaper.If u can’t qualify. Ask your close family member to help you. Of course. U service it.,btohqsg
Had spent $900 earlier on CRMC. Have an urgent expense $320 to pay using CRMC that left $100 unused.So 400 miles/$320 = 1.25mpd.,btohqsg
Is it the card need to use with amaze card? Or is diff?,btohqsg
hi everyone  just want to check if anyone has purchase SQ economy ticket and upgrade using miles to business class before? can i know on the process like how it works? and where i can find (if there is) to calculate the extra miles to upgrade from economy flight to business. going from sg to country A and returning from country B back to sg,btohqsg
Yes  need to use with amaze,btohqsg
and do this card can waived the annual fee?,btohqsg
Hi all. Is there currently any promo for Amaze? Can’t find any.Also any referral code to use?,btohqsg
is it need minimum speed per year or?,btohqsg
Only certain class ticket can upgrade with miles  the cheapest promo fare i dont think can. It is always best to just redeem biz class by itself,btohqsg
Hi all  just want to check for DBS Altitude  must the transactions be online transactions to enjoy the perks  especially those perks under Welcome Bonus?,btohqsg
What's the best way to convert SGD to USD and then transfer in brokerage accounts like IBKR & Saxo? Best rates  minimal fees  etc 😂,btohqsg
Saxo not sure. Ibkr. You just transfer sgd and exchange there will do. It is almost fx rates plus $2+ usd fees.,btohqsg
Hi all. Just to check if insurance payment though cardup via dbs altitude visa count as minimum spend of 3k for the welcome gift?,btohqsg
moomoo network down? unable to deposit funds. anyone experience it as well?,btohqsg
Hi wanna ask one more question.. is it the sc smart card good as a sub card for transport?? Or any recommended??,btohqsg
For $320: $100 will earn 400 miles and $220 will earn 88 miles. So technically 488 miles / $320 = 1.53 mpd 😅,btohqsg
It didn't specify insurance payment via cardup. All I know is direct payment using dbs altitude insurance definitely doesn't count to the minimum spend,btohqsg
So unless cardup change the mcc code of the payment not to reflect as insurance. Otherwise DBS probably will still not recognize it. Make sense?,btohqsg
I’m just wondering   CardUp shows 7399 on Heymax and this mcc is excluded in signup tnc Might be similar to dbs vantage whereby signup not eligible but maybe can clock the miles. Anyway ask the cso is better in written form.,btohqsg
"I have applied for GIRO payment plan for my income taxes  and i want to use CardUp to make recurring payments  must the recurring payment be the same for each month?Or can i use the ""update payment"" function to adjust the amount so that I can pay more for certain months and lesser for others?",btohqsg
