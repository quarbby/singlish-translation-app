Yup they mention le. They will give queue numbers of up to 300% subscribe per projectSo is up to 3.0x ba,btohqsg
Haha. I wish u the best and goodluck. üôè,btohqsg

last time can overlap application  meaning u apply for May BTO  then Aug one came out still can apply before u go for your May appointment,btohqsg
So many will try to apply both because the 1st launch if your number is at the back   u will likely to apply another one next,btohqsg
If i didnt get the feb bto  june bto can still apply again?,btohqsg
And next launch u gotten a better Q  then u can give up your 1st one.This is quite unfair system because those need a house is spoilt by all this ppl that plays the system this way ya,btohqsg
Like didnt get queue number ?,btohqsg
Means your Q is not within the supply then u can apply for June launch,btohqsg
Anyways just pray and also rememberAlways hope everyone can get their Q. Don't always hope dropout  don't always hope ppl will break up   divorce so u stands a chance.Just pray everyone is good and one day you will have a good karma and a good Q number. Your luck will come some day,btohqsg
Ya loLast time 8 k applicants fight for one projectNow 8 k applicants fight for 7 projects haha,btohqsg
7916 applicants for 1298 unitsMeans 6 k + people no chance to pick,btohqsg
Wa last time the rate was really crazy manNo wonder Govt change new law and the way to apply for BTOI guess it‚Äôs a good sign for all of us now üëç,btohqsg
After ballot successful  will we start receiving information of the BTO flat layout/site plan/flat availability once booking of flat starts? Cause our queue number is last 3 to choose a unit. Or we will only receive 1-2 weeks before our turn to book?,btohqsg
Thank you. I manage to find the pdf brochure,btohqsg
Meaning to say  as long as my queue number is out of supply  I can apply again for upcoming bto?,btohqsg
For SBF that is ready for key collection  if the queue number is called  is it an immediate down payment for the unit and key collection ?Meaning that the couple must provide a marriage certificate?Or is there a window period ?,btohqsg
You need to solemnise your marriage within 3 months from the completion of the flat purchase. HDB may request for a copy of your marriage certificate (where required) for verification.,btohqsg
@IgnChanJRfor more info do call HDB at 1800 866 3066,btohqsg
Hi hiMy HLE expired in July 24  so can I still take part in jun24 BTO?,btohqsg
Now is HFE you need it for all projects,btohqsg
Hiiianyone knows if married child priority scheme will apply for me and my partner if we are not married/engaged yet (but will be before keys collection) and the project we applying for is within 4km from our parents' place?,btohqsg
If u apply to live near parent should be eligible. But i suggest u apply first on next launch. Then the system will auto check if ur eligible or not.,btohqsg
Just want to ask u guys opinion..is it better to apply for sbf 2 room or apply for a 4room bto unit with 3 years waiting time?,btohqsg
Imo if money not issue  4 room. 2 room restrictions are too much. At least with 4 room can rent out. 2 room have to rent out whole unit.,btohqsg
