and if u still have loan u have to deal with it with no car with u so dun total loss,btohqsg
In a way i have asked insurance before abt stolen car etc .. how insurance claim. (For Comprehensive only),btohqsg
Total Loss does not mean u dun pay the left over is how much u are covered at time of loss. So if u have outstanding loan and it does not cover u still pay even without a car. Sad to say.,btohqsg
Yes ‚Ä¶ the loan and the insurance payout is distinct,btohqsg
So those cars who is confiscated‚Ä¶.:),btohqsg
Confiscated cars insurance happy HAHAHAHAHAHAH just pay outstanding LOL BYES,btohqsg
Happy ah? I dun think so lah cos one car less to collect premiums,btohqsg
The guy will get another car then buy from them again LOL,btohqsg
Yes and they are stream lining the non life part or the other way round:),btohqsg
AXA Singapore sold to HSBC..HSBC not continuing the vehicle insurance so now no more new biz  existing policy will run off (lapse) so no renewal for policyholders,btohqsg
I use axa for the past 10 year,btohqsg
Good thing come to an end,btohqsg
They suffer big losses over the years.. HSBC sacred this portfolio burn their base,btohqsg
Not surprise as u see how ppl claim insurance   a 30 k omv car accident repair can hit 6 digit   might as change car haha,btohqsg
Actually is the Injuries & Death claims that is crazy especially if breach of policies..By law insurers have to pay third party Injuries then recover from policyholder but u think policyholder will pay?,btohqsg
Car if deemed total loss still can recover from the vehicle shell,btohqsg
Policyholder die  recover from who lol.. estate also won't want to settle,btohqsg
It's also the driver's mentality.. ever heard of 1 case whereby this insured kept claiming then of cos premium affected his reply isn't that wat insurance supposed to do be doing.. pay my claims but cannot increase my premium,btohqsg
