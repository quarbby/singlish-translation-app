Hi  does anyone know if Klook is considered under travel for UOB lady card?Also  is taobao  lazada  shopee etc eligible for any category on UOB lady card?Thanks!,btohqsg
MCC Codes are a bit of a black box for the consumer. Whilst it could possibly vary  I think most of it is fairly similar  so whilst not a firm answer  I think that you could get a best guess of the MCC by referring to the following 2 websites:What Card: This website does not look it's up to date. But the MCCs (where available) are probably a guesstimate of what it might be today.https://www.whatcard.sg/Citi MCCs: Whilst other institutions may vary  I've compared a few codes and so far  all of them seem to use the same codes so I think it's a fairly decent guestimate of what the codes may refer too.https://www.citibank.com/tts/solutions/commercial-cards/assets/docs/govt/Merchant-Category-Codes.pdfNot an absolute certainty but I hope this helps to provide best guess for those looking for MCCs.,btohqsg

I dont think i spend too much for miles to be possible imo. (Abt 800 per month maybe) right now i using 1.6% cashback card. Dbs fresh live could potentially be 5% -10% (aka transport 10%). Family n friends is 8%. Citi rewards technically can get $50 vouchers which give about 2.2% excluding amaze card. I usually spend bulk on food (delivery and dine including friends and family food). I know not all cb eligible for each expenditure. Citi rewards could get from most thanks to amaze card pairing,btohqsg

Hello  what would be the best cashback and miles card  if I need to make SGD10k for flights and accommodations next month? Thanks.,btohqsg
Hello  I have Citi rewards credit card to get the 10x rewards points (limit 1k). However  it does not include travel expenses such as Airline ticket  hotels. I was wondering is there any other credit card out there that can get those rewards (4mpd) on travel related expenses.I‚Äôve tried applying for HSBC revolution  but they have rejected my application after 2 months of waiting. I have no idea why  they can‚Äôt disclose it.So was wondering is there other credit card that could earn 4mpd or cashback without minimum spend? Is Citi premier Miles card good  even though is 1.2mpd,btohqsg
Hi  i am a poly student with not much savings <6k  im using the basic dbs and uob bank account. But i am wondering if there is any bank account or cards availble for students to use for cashback,btohqsg
If the travel spend is online  dbs woman's world mastercard is your best option. 4mpd  no min spend and capped at $2k online transactions per month. But only for online transactions.,btohqsg
Ohhh I see! So this can be used for travel related expenses like airline tickets  hotel bookings as long as it‚Äôs made online? May I know for the expiry of points how long does it take? Is it possible to transfer to miles before expiry and extend it further?,btohqsg
Hmm 10k in one month is a bit tricky because some cards have a monthly cap on spend or cashback.. Maybe can consider using 2 or more cards?,btohqsg
Yes! Oh ya but the points expire in a year.. For me I convert them to asia miles instead of krisflyer miles. Asia miles expiry can be extended perpetually as long as you have some miles activity in your asia miles account,btohqsg
That's fine. Which few should i use? I can research further into those fews instead of researching everything out there. Thanks.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if SCB Simply Cash Credit Card can earn 1.5% cashback when topup grab wallet? I see the TnC like didnt exempt it.,btohqsg

2k/mth online spend limit for dbs wwmc  5k/mth spend limit for dbs altitude  not sure if there is a spend limit or cap for citi premiermiles..,btohqsg

Either through the referral programme or spending overseas. If my memory serves me right  for transactions of at least $10 SGD equivalent  1 insta point award per $1SGD equivalent,btohqsg

the amount refunded is the interest u get,btohqsg
I know  but using the amount refunded to calculate against the principal sum of money  it is only half. Means they only accepted half,btohqsg
Foreign currency spend only  so you only earn the pt everytime you not paying in SGD including buying things from Taobao ship to SG,btohqsg

Hi guys  using my wwmc on online shopping but in foreign currency  it seems that it logs as overseas spend rather than online spend? Is that right? üò≠,btohqsg

Ah I see then I guess too bad I will miss the current promo,btohqsg
if u applied a card recently and got approved or rejected  u can visit cbr website and obtain a free cbr A rejection can have many reasons  If in the event u hit all requirements and u still got rejected  It may be likely because there's some problem in your cbr  AKA late payment  debt due etc.,btohqsg

beware. quite a hassle to cancel. need to argue your way out. and they will do some legal confirmation on the call. best if you cancel after the annual fee is charged and you successfully waived it.,btohqsg

u apply for the $300 incentive? need to wait after 1yr then can cancel. just saying if you want to cancel it.,btohqsg

Depends on what your salary is. You can check salary crediting requirements for POSB Multiplier  OCBC 365  UOB One and SC BonusSaver respectively,btohqsg

Hi all  I signed up for citibank credit card through Singsaver and was patiently waiting for the reward. As it was taking too long  I decided to email singsaver recently to check and they told me that the reward collection email has been sent to me in July 2022 and collection expires in Oct 2022. But I did not receive such email. I had reply them to appeal. Was wondering if any of you encountered this as well and did you manage to still get your reward in the end?,btohqsg
I got rejected email 2 days later. My friend say usually should be within 1-2 working days if approve,btohqsg
by the term contactless payment  i can use the physical card and tap right? or i need to use phone to make payment?,btohqsg
but for hsbc revolution card  it have to be online too? if i dine at cafe  i wont get the 4miles?,btohqsg
Contactless like paywave for revo u can 4mpd,btohqsg
If I am not wrong  10x point for this card you need to satisfy both of two criteria  (1) online or paywave and (2) fall into given MCC list,btohqsg
Btw if anyone travels to Malaysia and want to get 4mpd with SG cards  you can buy touch and go reload pin from Lazada MY. Their MCC is 5310.,btohqsg
This is best dining card . Hotel restaurant also can.,btohqsg

Hi  gurus! May I know which is better for foreign currency transaction:TRUST Credit Card or Amaze paired with Citibank Cashback+?What are the differences b/w foreign currency transaction and overseas spending  if any?,btohqsg
DPs say trust gives very close to spot rate - about 0.3% spread(cant verify this personally because i dont use trust). Amaze in my experience has about 1.5% spread- the worse spread amongst all its competitors. But i would say you would 'make back' that amount through your credit card rewards as well as amaze's own cashback programme. So i would go with amaze here,btohqsg
anyone using HSBC revolution CC? any reviews on it if its a good cashback card,btohqsg

was initially looking at applying citi cashback+ which offers only 1.6% with no min spend,btohqsg
HSBC revolution when pair with ega is 2.5%+1% however if u redeem voucher instead 2.5% can become 3.33% hence is potential 4.33%,btohqsg

Kris+ surprisingly easy to use coz you dont have to manually fund the wallet as long as you have apple or google pay credit cards,btohqsg
And if you have leftover kris points balance it can just take the short fall from your card meaning you can always zero your krispoints balance in case you didn't transfer it to krisflyer,btohqsg
No idea.üòÖ Hoping some one here can advise,btohqsg
I never realised that Trust Bank can withdraw with SoCash. Gonna be helpful üëç,btohqsg
I don't think can. But SCB can  and I suspect Trust bank just copy pasted the SCB exclusion list ü§£,btohqsg
Oh I see  thanks for the info,btohqsg

Hi! Does anyone have any problem using Amaze linked to google pay for contactless? The card readers rejected my gpay multiple times  at different shops üò≠ P.S i did not make google pay my default app because I'm using samsung pay for as default  is it because of this?,btohqsg
Yeah happens a lot for me especially with the white POS machines in Malaysia. I just bring the physical card with me,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs amaze in general  I had to contact both the bank and amaze to get them to contact MC to allow my transactions to go through. Not sure which one did the trick  but gotta tell them which merchant.. so quite leh Cheh. Hard to do if you are in a physical store  it will take some time to clear,btohqsg
My physical card also declined at times,btohqsg
Okay  glad im not in the same boat haha! Yeah  i ended up using my physical card  but sometimes i kanchiong ah  then i use another credit card to pay üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
want to ask if for CRMC + Amaze for MCC 5814 ( Fast Food ) does it qualify for 4mpd ?,btohqsg
but this doesnt apply for 5812 ( Eating Place and Restuarnt right ) ?,btohqsg
it does. All mcc that is not excluded in TnC get 4mpd.,btohqsg
so basically the basic excluded ( insurance   hospital blah blah ) and TravelCIti TnC is not very well explained cause i keep looking at their provided MCC 10x Eligble Txn thinking only can use for those.thanks for the info,btohqsg
should look under the online portion of the TnC. Amaze converts all transactions to online  so all mcc eligible so long not excluded.,btohqsg
I'm keen to use Amaze  can I know if I can use amaze (link with CRMC) to input for payment of my recurring online subscription  which auto charged by merchant every month?,btohqsg
And would this then qualify as 10x point under CRMC?,btohqsg
yes so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
Why not OCBC TR if the big ticket items are within the bonus category?,btohqsg
You ask me I ask who. T&Cs say so,btohqsg
Uob abs nerf grabpay. What will be next best option for ins prem without processing fees after Jan?,btohqsg

Yeah could happen to tcb. What about ocbc get cashflo? Non ge product can ?,btohqsg
Why gst now 8%? Wah hahahaha,btohqsg
cos not online. must be online to get 4mpd for dbs wwmc or citi rewards for telco. Can use Amaze+citi rewards mastercard for recurring payment  will be converted to online,btohqsg
Hi guys  is the citybank cashback card able to get the 1.6% rebate by paying NUS school fee ?,btohqsg
Cannot  T&C excludes cashback for payment to educational institutions,btohqsg
Alright  think will just get UOB absolute cashback instead,btohqsg
Yep if Amex is accepted by NUS,btohqsg
Better check not all accept Amex,btohqsg
Feeek amex issued better overall vs uob amex,btohqsg
OIC. Myrepublic used to charge recurring as online  but they just changed payment vendor so dunno about now,btohqsg
Uob amex don't support mobile walletNo amex pay no amex app promotion & amex issued still can earn grab point,btohqsg
U mean the AMEX true cashback card better?,btohqsg
Got more perks over uob amex,btohqsg
for this does HSBC gives 4mpd for purchasing of gigabucks ?,btohqsg
May I know what's the amexpay promo now?,btohqsg
Amex Pay is a function in app it not a promo,btohqsg
Let u scan SgQRThe promo is depend on yours acc amex will list in yours app,btohqsg
Tcb This time the perk so so only. Don't have the telecom and electricity cashback.,btohqsg
Contact less $10 get $2 back one time. And fashion retail $68 get $8 back.,btohqsg
Limited to some specific store only for fashion retail,btohqsg
Last time got promo on SgQR evey scan give u Cashback,btohqsg
Last time got Cashback fir utility like your electric,btohqsg
That why I find amex issued cards more benefit,btohqsg
anyone know if dbs vantage is still worth using with their petrol and dining 4mpd perks going away,btohqsg
Anyone knows any card that is good for huge purchases like household appliances and comes with airport lounge access?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know  if I link my Amaze card with UOB priv master card (2.4mpd for oversea spending)  will I still get the 2.4mpd for oversea spending? Cos it seems like Amaze is the one doing the conversion?,btohqsg
Amaze treat and convert everything as online local spend,btohqsg
Hmm okay  but heard there is a cap for the amount of OCBC$ that can be earned a year tho,btohqsg
Not really worth it unless you‚Äôre eyeing for the sign up bonus which is spend 8k and get miles . There is better deals around,btohqsg
Ah okay  thank you so much!,btohqsg
Hi guys   just want to know   if I‚Äôm using OCBC titanium + Instarem amaze . Will I get the 4mpd if it‚Äôs charged in taobao app anyone knows ?,btohqsg
Excuse the ignorance but are mpd points calculated based on the statement balance or the total spend throughout the statement period? E.g. Spend $1000 but return $500 (within the statement month). Are points calculated based on the $1000 spend or the statement balance of $500?,btohqsg
Amaze converts to sgd so no FCY rate,btohqsg
Thank but will the Amaze via uob priv MasterCard gain 2.4mpd as priv card only give 2.4mpd for overseas spending.,btohqsg
Or else I get only 1.4mile,btohqsg
If u use amaze it is sgd so its always 1.4 miles. But transactions above 10sgd will get u the 1% cashback. If u want the 2.4 miles you should use the card on its own and pay the 3.25% fcy charge. So depends on what u want,btohqsg
I think it is a fair deal. With privi I would likely just take the 1% cashback anyway  since the extra fcy charge is not worth the 1.4 additional miles anyway. Would be slightly different if its a 4mpd card so really depends on your preference and use case,btohqsg
Haha understand. But uob don't have a MasterCard for men that allows higher mpd,btohqsg
Haha yea no worries. Just saying that if a hack feels too good to be true (i.e getting foreign currency miles but charged in sgd)  then it likely is. üòÖEither review your use case and consider using other cards (e.g. Crmc) or just live with whatever u have  no right no wrong üëç,btohqsg

The assessable income is based on how much your company files for you.,btohqsg
Then the rebates/reliefs are then calculated then they will tax your chargeable income,btohqsg
Do you mean 6k of CPF tax relief?,btohqsg
Capita evoucher purchase for 1888 star still available?,btohqsg
Taxable income (minus) tax relief = chargeable incomeYou will be taxed on chargeable income,btohqsg

currently have about 31k+ in my OA and 16k+ in my MA. is it wise for me to max my MA immediately? realised that i can probably hit it by the end of this year.Math:current OA = 31k+current MA = 16k+monthly cpf into OA  1150*12 = 13800monthly cpf into MA  400*12 = 4800vcma = 8kMA EOY = 16k + 8k + 4800 + 39700(OA) = 68500OA EOY = 5.1k~go? no-go?,btohqsg
You can transfer from OA to SA ... Not to MA.,btohqsg
There's no point for you to aim for FRS at this stage. If you are very sure you won't need your OA for property  by all means transfer to SA. Most of the times  property returns are better than the additional interest you get from transferring from OA to SA as you are often leveraging for property.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm getting my flat this year  wonder if I should move my OA to SA or park it a side  or just let HDb deduct all my OASince interests will have to be pay back if flat will be sold (but we‚Äôve no plans yet)   better I pay minimal instead?,btohqsg
5k per transaction. 10k in a month.  30k in a year,btohqsg
I would use CPF OA to pay for the mortgage. Especially now with the high bank and FD interest rates the cash can be used to earn more interest than OA.,btohqsg

Hi experts can i check something with regard to UOB ONE card:Is there a specific month like Jan Feb Mar (1st Quarter) to clock the rebate or it start from the point when i first used the card? I have just gotten the card so i am wondering should i start using it or should i wait till the qualifying month to start using it.,btohqsg
everyone quarter month is different. It start form the month the card is approved,btohqsg
I see. So if my card approve in end dec and i start using say in January statement then i have already miss one month?,btohqsg
for first quarter  you get 2/3 of tiered quarterly rebate if met spending for 2nd and 3rd month  1/3 if met spending for 3rd month,btohqsg

Anyone has any clue regarding this,btohqsg
Does the credit card bank look at unbilled statement too when they issue the card?,btohqsg
Once you pay you can split into installments on the citi app. But beware  you may be asked to pay an admin charge. Also  you won't earn points for installment payments (not that insurance will earn any points anyway),btohqsg
I paid my insurance last month around $6k  but uob haven't bill me.,btohqsg
are you asking about general installment payments  or citi payall?Either way just FYI CRMC is a bad card  citi payall only gives 0.4mpd  or 0 miles if u pay by the credit card,btohqsg
How long did you wait since you apply,btohqsg
You are spending with a different card from a different bank  so I don't see how HSBC will be able to look at that data,btohqsg
Around a week or two. Did you apply through singpass signup,btohqsg
Not sure if I should get a new card just to pay for my insurance,btohqsg
Get Amex TCB and GPMC  pay via AXS,btohqsg
Ok  I thought it be shown in the credit bureau report. I paid all my bills  nothing outstanding.,btohqsg
can look into getting CitiPM  it's the next best  if u want to get 1.2miles,btohqsg
I mean I only spend 1k per month. Only this insurance payment is a huge payment. So not really sure is it even worth getting another card for jt,btohqsg
Just worried $6k unbilled amount and $5k grab topup will flag some negative on my credit rating.,btohqsg
For citibank I applied through their web as I already hold premiere miles. So won't get anything for new signup,btohqsg
Probably should be quite fast since your already their customer,btohqsg
Applied on 27thdec. Now still waiting. Was told 5 to 7 working days. But still waiting,btohqsg
Feel free to drop them a call regarding it. I think they will be fine since your already their customer onhand,btohqsg
Called twice. Say will send Email to expedite still the same,btohqsg

Just to check  if i only use WWMC for flights and hotel booking Would we still be able to get the annual fee waived? And is there a min spend every month?,btohqsg

"It's not ""can be centralized""  the nature of CBDCs is that it IS centralized. It's right in the name ""CENTRALIZED bank digital currency"". Singapore has renamed it ""Purpose Bound Money"" or PBM. Which as it's name suggests  is more like a voucher  then money as you can only use it within certain limits (i.e. the purpose that's tagged to it).There are several ongoing ""campaigns"" that are nudging us towards the use of CBDCs:- Rebranding it PBMs- CDC vouchers- Gov Wallets (via Singpass)- No more printing of new notes (for CNY?)- Strongly encouraging digital payment methods over cash (environment?)We are still a long way from full fledged CBDCs but we are certainly headed in that direction. IF the entire economy only relies on CBDCs  this would mean a central governing body that stipulates our personal spending habits... telling us what we can and cannot buy.CBDCs are not to be confused with Crypto. Whilst both are digital  the underlying technology of crypto seeks to decentralize power whereas CBDCs aims to centralize power.",btohqsg

If u not investing in oa. Maybe after deduct the amount hdb will deduct + if your salary for oa is enough to cover monthly. Not sure the actual procedure of hdb as I not yet getting. But I think this is the process. Or u can bid for tbills part of OA to take advantage of artibirage rates.,btohqsg
Example if your salary enough to cover installment through OA. Then either tbills all except 20k. Or transfer to SA.Of course this is part of strategy. Your cash side is different.,btohqsg
Need to think about futures rstu as well if you earning high salary that need yearly contribution to reduce tax.,btohqsg

"e-angpao has actually been around for several years now  but has never really taken off. These days there's a hard push towards going digital and they've even stopped printing new notes this year  on the premise of ""saving the environment"". We will continue to see more encouragement to go digital  such as discounts like NTUC $6 discount for $55 CDC voucher used  And we will continue to see limitations with paper money  such as stores not accepting paper cash or not printing paper cash or being charged to use paper cash  etc.As crypto is a direct competitor to CBDCs  I think that we will continue to see more FTX-type cases cropping up as well  that will result in regulations on the premise of ""protecting people"".",btohqsg

Most likely the 7-9% dividends are projected and non guaranteed.,btohqsg
There's fees to be paid to a fund manager who manages the unit trust... usually more than what you'd pay if u DCA into an index ETF...,btohqsg

To clarify on the requirements for HSBC EGA $350 Singsaver gift:- Deposit $5000 on opening  $5000 on following month- Maintain the EGA account by monthly deposit $2000 and 5 transactions.- At the video time 03:33 Yes you need to apply for investment account and make 1 trade- For SGX stock trade  the min brokerage fee is $11 SGD after GST. Can just buy the cheapest stock. But $11+ is the minimum cash outlay,btohqsg
Will the $350 gift or cashback subsequently be affected if we withdraw the fresh fund deposited?,btohqsg
Sources have reflected that if you have credit card before EGA  the EGA application cannot be done online and will require Physical application  so YMMV,btohqsg
Deleted my source  will verify again,btohqsg
Any suggestions on the cheapest trade to satisfy the requirement?,btohqsg
Data point : yes hsbc staff told me need to do manual giro to qualify for EGA 1%,btohqsg
Refer to my edited comment above^,btohqsg
Hi guys  first time applying for HSBC card  couldn't get through the application on the website so I applied thru the app instead.. It says my application got approved but I did not receive any email with regards to my application no... I scared I can't apply for Singsaver rewards üò•,btohqsg

Hi  question on CPF investment account : CPF app says I don't have a CPF OA Investment account BUT on dbs vickers I linked my CPF account to my DBS vickers trading account. (I already use Vickers for my SRS). Does that mean that DBS vickers will do the needful behind the scenes tk open the CPF OA trading account or is something else needed? Thank you,btohqsg
I see.. so its just 4 digits and that's it?,btohqsg
Can confirm citi  for hsbc  tnc says ok  but not sure,btohqsg
Will they charge foreign transaction fee 2.5%? Since in RM,btohqsg

Amaze only charge around 2% margin,btohqsg

he talking about EGA account application,btohqsg
Yes  after transfer into EGA can transfer out the excess after GIRO bill payment done,btohqsg
I doubt you can do in store installment plan with amaze. Because machines read amaze as a debit card,btohqsg
If you already applied thru HSBC app  you're already not going through singsaver so it wont apply,btohqsg
This you have to check with DBS,btohqsg
Yeah i was talking about application  not the GIRO Part,btohqsg
Thanks. I sent a message. Let's see what happens next... Thanks,btohqsg

OCBC Frank has 8% cashback on foreign currency spend. Is this better than amaze or revolut even after taking into account all transaction and conversion fees for small spends? Assuming hitting minimum spend is not an issue.,btohqsg
sub-limit of $25 for the FCY spend category  so you max out at $312.50 of FCY spend. Then you need to make up the remaining $800 min spend using the contactless & online category  but wait! that also has a sub-limit cap of $25  so again you max out at $312.50 of spending. so that's only $625 out of $800 spend  and you need to make up the remaining $175 of spend in a suboptimal manner (either in the generic cashback category which earns you 0.3% or continue earning 0% in either of these two categories),btohqsg
Any ideas for side hustle to earn additional income?,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I have my Citi cashback tag to my amaze card  during dining sometimes they have this promo for Citibank cashback card like return voucher or $$ discounts  and I only have amaze card not Citi cashback  how does you guys deal with it? Anyone encounter before? I do added my Citibank cashback to my Apple Pay though.,btohqsg
So you show your Citibank cashback card via Apple Pay wallet to the staff?,btohqsg
Instead of physical card? Cos they will want to see the card..,btohqsg
Yes. I know the limitations of frank card  but I'm using the card for iPayMy anyway. If I use it only for iPayMy  I get 3.125%. But if I mix in some Forex spend  the net returns will definitely be higher  and I also get some additional cashback for forex spends. Just wondering what is the penalty for forex spend in this case  and if this use case beats using amaze or revolut.,btohqsg

I don't think there is such way to withdraw 100%. Of coz if u use it to pay for something and indirectly withdraw as cash  it's possible. But definitely will have a % fee charged,btohqsg
you dont earn the 10x pt anymore  so all transaction after $1000 is 1 pt only or 0.4 mpd if im not wrong,btohqsg

I don't do grocery shopping much.. the yuu categories don't really suit my spending areaü´•,btohqsg
I think dbs altitude is a good option for hotel and airline spend. Dbs altitude can earn 3mpd. If book through Expedia then it is 6mpd.Citi premiermiles also has some limited time promos for travel spend and can tag to amaze since its a mastercard.Miles earned in either card have no expiry date,btohqsg
No min spend for these 2 cards,btohqsg
Hi just wondering is there any cash back cards for overseas hotel?Or does citi rewards card give 4 mile per dollar on overseas hotel booking?Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Don't use Citi Rewards  you'll only get 0.4 mpd.You can use the following:- HSBC Revolution (online or contactless) for 4 mpd or 2.5% cashback- OCBC 365 for 3% cashback- DBS WWMC (online booking) for 4 mpd- UOB Lady's (travel as 10X category) for 4 mpd,btohqsg
I wish to check has anyone tried using CRMC to book hotel via shopee? Does the mcc code in this case allow 10x reward points?,btohqsg
Shopee has a hotel booking portal?,btohqsg

Bonus points will be credited in the following month,btohqsg
I forgot that you can also consider Uob Lady's card 4mpd for travel category  no min spend  for ladies only,btohqsg
I'm seeing a lot of msgs about gxs  is it legit? And invite only?,btohqsg
Yes it is legit and invite only. But I see little use of it when compared to UOB 1 or OCBC 360 account.,btohqsg

But you don't have to hit certain criterias to earn with it  maybe easier for less hassle?,btohqsg

But how do you get invited?,btohqsg
Nope  you will see it in the next month's statement,btohqsg
7th business day of the month. Most likely tomorrow,btohqsg

Means other transactions under DBS WWMC gained more x points than the yoga package,btohqsg

Nope  normal transactions cause I was wondering what the MCC for the online yoga package is,btohqsg
what u mean by other transactions gain more x points? are these foreign spending so getting 3x base points instead of 1x point?How u know 1x points only and no 9x bonus points for the yoga package. when was the transaction made. Already received bonus points on 16th on following calendar month?,btohqsg
I used this info to determine if is 1x or 2x. Will wait for the 16th to determine if there's bonus points thenhttps://milelion.com/2019/04/18/dbs-virtual-assistant-now-provides-mccs-and-rewards-points-per-transaction/,btohqsg

yes  ega doesnt care about card  card doesnt care about ega,btohqsg
That‚Äôs as expected haha üôè btw the 2 consecutive 5k when can transfer out? Same month or like 2 months later. They never mention the balance (except the min 2k) to maintain for this promo,btohqsg
No sure leh‚Ä¶ seems like not mentioned in tnc,btohqsg
not mentioned means no such restriction,btohqsg
One more thing if you intend to apply for EGA but not the CC  you still need to fulfill 5x transactions with the Debit card at least,btohqsg

SimplyGo actually earns you 1x reward points on HSBC Revo. Effectively 0.4MPD. Called in to their cs support desk to check the other day.,btohqsg
So if I use SimplyGo can or cannot ah?,btohqsg
Whether or not it is counted as qualifying spend remains a mystery,btohqsg
Can use for simplygo. But might not be counted as qualifying spend.,btohqsg
Btw the $800 is started from the day you get your physical card or digital card,btohqsg
Can use but only basic 1x point/0.4 mpd. Not eligible for bonus 9x points as simplygo mcc is 4111 not whitelisted,btohqsg
The concern now is more of whether simplygo transactions can be counted in the $800 singsaver spending requirements,btohqsg
Ic ic‚Ä¶ need to check. My revo cc was via official site. 200 cash back upon 500 spend. According to that tnc  the 500 spending only excludes those common government/insurance/axs etc. not as strict as its whitelisted 10x mcc categories.,btohqsg
Does SimplyGo transaction count as contactless payment?,btohqsg
Some cards count SimplyGo as contactless  some don't. It's all very confusing.Cards that count:- DBS Live Fresh- UOB EVOL- OCBC FRANKCards that don't count:- UOB PPV- UOB VS- HSBC Revo (not in MCC whitelist),btohqsg
sry my mistake  I think seems like Simplygo not excluded from the $800 qualifying spend,btohqsg
can‚Äôt confirm unless u call HSBC  but if u see their TnC in the picture   don‚Äôt see how it falls under these exceptions,btohqsg
HSBC revo stated that for simply go you only get 1x rewards aka 0.4mpd,btohqsg
iirc LiveFresh is because simplygo is considered under green lifestyle hence,btohqsg
It counts as both. So 10% cashback,btohqsg
Hi All  I would like to check if I use amaze card to pay my private hailing services (eg. TADA  GoJek  RYDE) what is the transaction will be appearing in my credit card bill?,btohqsg
Notice if you applied the credit card and your try to apply for the ega promo  the website will say you have an existing relationship with them‚Ä¶maybe anyone can confirm this?,btohqsg
So the individual bank for that credit card will count that transaction as online payment or category?,btohqsg
You will earn rewards for:- online spending- MCC specific categoriesYou won't earn rewards for:- merchant specific categoriesExample: if the T&Cs state specifically state that you will earn rewards for Grab  then routing through amaze will earn you nothing.,btohqsg

This earn 4mpd for recurring payment?,btohqsg
It's a fixed rebate amount. So if you spend $2K every month for one quarter  you get $200 for that quarter  notwithstanding the bonus cashback rate for DFI  Shopee  Grab  SimplyGo  etc.,btohqsg
You can think of it as a cap in the sense that any spending above $2K doesn't earn you additional cashback unless it's in one of the bonus categories.,btohqsg
