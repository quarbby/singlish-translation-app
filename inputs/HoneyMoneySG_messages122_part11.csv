If I am uob hod for credit card. . I will push this card to fight against amex platinum card... and ask Kris flyer whether can status match and also work together with marriott bonvy programme.,btohqsg
You only have one 4mpd card and one 3mpd cards. If you want to chase miles  better focus than spreading it between cashback and miles.,btohqsg
Or which selective category for solitare card is 4mpd for retail shopping? Then I replace Family category with it and use One card for groceries.,btohqsg
That was my aim but couldn't find a 4mpd uob card that can catch all. So end up with One card as the default catch all.,btohqsg
Does krisflyer gives 3mpd for ALL online shopping? I was hoping this could be the unlimited miles catch all card but looks like it's not...,btohqsg
Haha .. now after revolution nerf hotel mcc.. next question what card to I use for 4 miles..Guys remember to use it before 31 Dec.,btohqsg
For hotel:lady/lady solitaire (travel category)dbs wwmc for onlineuob ppv for mobile contactlessuob visa signature for local conractless (min 1k in sgd)/ overseas (min S$1k in foreIgn currency),btohqsg
"It seems you need an additional card. The UOB preferred platinum visa appears to be what you are describing in that it gives 4mpd for mobile contactless/selected online for your ""catch all"" retail spending. PPV doesn't have min spend so it is ideal for your scenario since you are already heavily in the uob ecosystem for miles pooling",btohqsg
This I different from you.Travel and online shopping I use dbs woman card.Contactless.  Citi rewards with amazeHotel. Amex platinum card or citi premier miles.,btohqsg
1 more to add. Local retail. Ocbc rewards card.,btohqsg
Ok thanks bros. I go look harder at uob preferred platinum.,btohqsg
Yes. And it’s based on posted date. So do avoid last few days of the month.,btohqsg

Hi   just to check is it advisable to transfer OA $ to SA to gain more interest .So when reached 55 after the  FRS all the $ will transfer from the SA back to the OA so can be  withdrawn from the OA account.No need to pay for housing  no kids   not investing  don't intend to buy another property.43 yrs old. Thanks🙏,btohqsg
Then should be yes. Since you already mention no invest no property. Then place oa for what.,btohqsg
some like to use cash to do RSTI top up to SA $8k PA for tax reduction.So depends on your situation.Also since like what you mentioned. not using any of OA for those items  for me it makes sense to trf and top up SA as the earlier u fill up FRS  u are compounding it yearly.,btohqsg
Hi allAny good way to withdraw from EZLINK E-wallet? Top up to revolut and withdraw via bank transfer? That incurs some charges,btohqsg
Hi  what MCC does cruises fall under? Which credit card is preferred for miles earning?,btohqsg

Usually travel category  uob lady/lady solitaire/dbs wwmc,btohqsg
There is cap to the bonus point. U can check out your dbs spend reward to decide if u have join the mid year spend promo,btohqsg
Usually credited together next month. Around 4-5th.,btohqsg
Can we RSTI with cash even though we have hit FRS?,btohqsg

Anyone is using cardup for AIA insurance premium payment? My agent is saying that only mastercard payment through cardup is allowed  but I plan to use my UOB Priv Miles Visa for cardup payment which can get a lower fee.I thought cardup will directly make payment to AIA  so what card I am using shouldn't matter to AIA right?,btohqsg
I'm using visa. Works for me :),btohqsg
So just create a payment plan in cardup and terminate the existing auto deduction plan in AIA will do?My agent seems like don't even know what is cardup and what is the correct thing to do..,btohqsg
