Here‚Äôs an interesting economic question. Does inflation drive demand or will it reduce demand of consumer goods?,btohqsg
Consumer goods refers to a wide range of goods. Discretionary? Staples?,btohqsg
Not all good will be hit equally,btohqsg
Bottom range staples.. will be likely hit.. as people will now shift to cheaper alternatives because it is now priced outside of their comfort zone,btohqsg
Inflation will then have to be considered with respect to the countries demographics,btohqsg
Some countries with more spending power will see their middle class continuing their expenditure.. while those in countries with less than stable situations will likely cut down..,btohqsg
Economist statement. Inflation will make the basic goods more expensive  so the people will have to spend a larger portion of their income on the necessities  and have less spending power on discrenationaries,btohqsg
I rarely order drinks nowadays when having lunch/dinner to control spending üò≠,btohqsg

ArionEnt might come too. Seems like NTE done with the selling.Most of the recent big hands changed at $0.011 recently.I think $0.006 should be safe . $0.005 not easy to get.Micros have favour with HGH leading.Let‚Äôs see whether they come along,btohqsg
Aiyah  change tactic lah  nothing to be shameful about.,btohqsg
Zero Covid policy my 1 year old kid also know it won't work,btohqsg
Imagine if you can control Zero policy on coughing  sneezing?  Not possible right?,btohqsg
But Xi has bet too much on zero-Covid to step back now  experts say.,btohqsg
Inflation will drive demand in consumer goods up to the point (say 60 per cent like in Turkey?) where very high inflation lead people to consider substitutes (unlikely) or just eliminate the said good from their consumption basket (likely). At hyperinflation  demand will revert and grow because by then  the local currency is worthless and consumers will just use USD or EUR or whatever.,btohqsg
Unfortunately economics is not a science so... Hard to say. Many idiosyncrasies,btohqsg
Tats wher interest hike comes in to fight inflation.,btohqsg
the economy theory I learn from the past is that in theory  inflation will drive up demand for consumer goods but that was 10-15 years ago. At the current inflation rate  I think it likely to have the reverse effect.,btohqsg
How to fight? Bank give you 1-2% higher interest but inflation at 8% or higher  still suffering ü§£,btohqsg
Reduce money flowin outside due to hike. Mainly ppl wil cut n only spend on main staple stuff,btohqsg
Hike will reach to a point wher it can fight inflation,btohqsg
But limit to hike too . Us won't shoot themselves on their own foot,btohqsg
Ya‚Ä¶especially with the huge debt they own  interest payment will be their downfall,btohqsg
Ya. Tink by next yr end  mayb inflation news gone lol,btohqsg
Malaysia coffeeshop everyone must order drinks  right?,btohqsg
No choice I no budget üò≠,btohqsg

So far never happen to me...,btohqsg

Don't want lar... Don't want you to be blacklisted too...üòù,btohqsg
Just joking. Last time I tried to save on drinks also. But during covid  we actually went to those coffeeshops at office areas and buy drinks from them when we pack food nearby. Very poor thing during covid  they hardly any biz. But recently $1.40 per drink I feel the pinch too,btohqsg
I hardly buy drink from kopi shop  do you know for $1.40 per drink  they earn $1.30,btohqsg
Drink is high profit margin item in F&B,btohqsg
