Matured estate older HDB tends to have this issue. But it's akin to saying our old parents are low ses.,btohqsg
Please lor my place BTO also got morons who smoke downstairs and the smell gets into the lifts also..,btohqsg
Vintage.. they don't make em like these anymore.. now more like dumpster tips.,btohqsg
Till you need the ABS and air bags or legs and hands tired of changing gears or need to manually wind down the windows and adjust the side mirrors. Oh not forgetting no rear view camera and proximity sensor for parking.,btohqsg
Its the cigarette they smoke bah. Some older generations smoke dunno simi brands de.. smelly ~I hate it when i got in grab  got the smell..my clothes also got the smell üòÖ,btohqsg
wow ad hominem attacks are way more telling of your brain issues but ok  asides from that  do you think socio economic is only in reference to ones financial status? or do you think that the inability to conform to societal norms is beneficial to society?,btohqsg

My ex de landlord.. omg the toilet so smelly. I want faint le,btohqsg
Why u like that? I always smoke outside my neighbour's window ü§£,btohqsg
Factually  your linking smokers to low ses is telling in both your attitude and apparent lack of observation and general awareness. That's all I'm implying. If the shoe fits. If it doesn't  kindly clarify why wisdom has always been faster than your thought processes.,btohqsg
That one  factual. My grandma used to buy those when she out of budget for her usual. üòÇü§£ She said it's cheaper.,btohqsg

You protect me from all the insects?,btohqsg
With the piak piak sound. ü§≠,btohqsg
i didn‚Äôt link smokers per se  i said that the smoking in lifts were a low ses issue as per the socio aspect in ses  and if you do honestly think what you‚Äôre spewing is wisdom you got another think coming kek,btohqsg

At least you dont light yourself on fire after rolling in a blanket.,btohqsg
Again  it's not limited to a ses issue  if your brain only has that difference on its mind  none of us here can help you.,btohqsg
Thank you for pointing out the wrongly autocorrected word,btohqsg
you were the one who linked it to finances,btohqsg
it‚Äôs linked to both societal and economic,btohqsg
if not for your constant use of ad hominem  you might have made a little more sense,btohqsg
Again  you were the one who linked it  where my rebuttal was that it's not limited to a low ses environment only  as you implied.,btohqsg
If not RWS and MBS halls won't reek of smoke.,btohqsg
The only SES I knows. üòî,btohqsg
my response was to the issue about smoking in the lifts  which shows the inability to conform to societal standards  you are the clown who thinks that people unable to follow rules in a hdb is equivalent to people who book mbs smoking rooms and are well within their rights to smoke in said smoking rooms,btohqsg
I must say I don't recall them.,btohqsg
It's ok young man. This kpop is my era one.,btohqsg
your liao more than maggie mee,btohqsg
Again  the clown is the one who thinks that the air in MBS and RWS solely comes from smoking rooms and that it's their right. üòèSG laws banned smoking in air-conditioned places and includes lifts.So go ahead and do as you please because you don't seem to comprehend what I said regardless of phrasing.,btohqsg
High ses is Liao more than mee.Low ses is Mee more than Liao.,btohqsg
haiya. i low ses cause i use lift. high ses don‚Äôt use lift cause they live in jiak hong chu. no smoke in lift problem. okay bo?,btohqsg
that one their own lift. they smoke their problem. dps wont complain.,btohqsg
and your assumption that anyone who stays mbs is automatically high ses shows what a clown you are kek,btohqsg
hi can bring me go mbs ma?,btohqsg
That's true. There's one in Singapore with private car lift. Imagine all the exhaust. It's like 10000 smokers all huff and puff at once.,btohqsg
