Besides  H3 Math already offers a taste of pure math,btohqsg
the main reason why they dont wanna proceed to that is bc its abit too complex alr tbh,btohqsg
Unlike H2 math which is mainly computation by plugging numbers into GCs,btohqsg
ur stuffing them with those stuff they wld be confused,btohqsg
I regret not being able to learn what i am learning now earlier. I never had the opportunity. That's the issue. If someone had introduced all these more advanced topics in an abstract way  I would have done so much more by now.Some people learn university stuff at age 9. I doubt I can do that but maybe some time later,btohqsg
And how many % of the population can do that?,btohqsg
I'm not clever. I feel stupid usually. I can't do a lot of things.,btohqsg
My meaning is that it is very very rare for a kid to be at this level,btohqsg
And in SG  we have avenues for such talents to prosper,btohqsg
We have the gifted ed programme  and we also have NUS high for science and maths,btohqsg
H3 is too late. JC2 is too late. And in Singapore you cannot skip years.I saw the MOE H3 mathematics and was unimpressed by it. I looked at the definition of continuity and laughed.,btohqsg
ðŸ¤”Can literally say the same for every other subject  and detractors who are weak in the aforementioned subjects will protest in disdain.,btohqsg
In NUSH  the kids complete J2 stuff by Y4  and do uni level for Y5 and 6,btohqsg
I understand  but the syllabus is currently filled with things I can't do. You can remove them and put this in,btohqsg
Many of the science international Olympiad teams take in kids from nush as well  and the usual RI HC ACS,btohqsg
"Although I have felt the same way as you in that ""there was no opportunity for me at a younger age""  you must understand that the education system is designed for majority of students",btohqsg
GEP is not a good. How are people selected? And what if they are not a all rounder. Most geniuses are not all rounders. And I'm not even sure if they teach mathematics rigourously in there,btohqsg
you do have to teach them the basics before u throw in something complicated which is linked to those basics,btohqsg
For international science olympiads  RI and NUSH form a duopoly,btohqsg
The rest of the JCs have <20% combined market share,btohqsg
not giving these complicated ideas without allowing them to get a grasp of the basics will make fhem confused,btohqsg
What if people fall through the cracks and don't end up in NUSH? The admissions process doesn't catch everyone,btohqsg
But at the expense of Singapore winning a nobel prize or the fields medal? We can have a accelerated stream on top of the express stream,btohqsg
Itâ€™s impossible to make sure people donâ€™t fall through the cracks  but NUSH has two intake periods  so itâ€™s less likely that a genius wonâ€™t be noticed,btohqsg
One in Sec 1  one in Sec 3,btohqsg
Mathematics Olympiad is not even really rigourous mathematics. Why bother? Don't know about the natural sciences though,btohqsg
We kind of already have that,btohqsg
Sad isn't it? If we have this perhaps Singapore gets a number of nobel prizes and fields medals,btohqsg
Maybe  but that was just an example,btohqsg
I think the education system is alr decent enough,btohqsg
I dont think an education system is defined to be a success based on the number of nobel prizes and medal winners,btohqsg
We do catch legit geniuses and they do end up in institutions that can cultivate their abilities,btohqsg
Yeah I think it would be nice if the system were more flexible,btohqsg
That's why I created more opportunities for myself as I grew older,btohqsg
Ask urself what are actually some other contributing reasons why singapore hardly produces such ppl?,btohqsg
Well  I know there is no perfect system  but we need to actively look for geniuses everywhere. Not wait for them to apply,btohqsg
Is not just the education system,btohqsg
To be crude  NS is another reason why,btohqsg
i.e. they go to places like Cambridge,btohqsg
The 2 yrs can make a huge difference,btohqsg
But for example fields medal has an age limit of 40. So you need to get mathematicians trained quickly and have them more time to come up with something that wins them the fields medal,btohqsg
cuz singapore's education is programmed to produce high skilled workers that work for rich employers,btohqsg
But at the end of the day  is a duty to serve the nation anyways,btohqsg
But I believe everyone in p3 is compelled to go for the GEP screening test,btohqsg
*Proceeds to increase intake of more computing students*,btohqsg
And the gep test is primarily logic,btohqsg
the purpose of educating others is so they can work for the rich  if everyone were to have their talents developed and could make big money and win awards no one wld be working for others and the equilibrium of the whole society wld be flipped,btohqsg
Not necessarily. Some just don't want to and there are so many factors. And if they go to Cambridge  aren't you scared Singapore doesn't retain them  i.e. they remain overseas or even become a foreign national?,btohqsg
The last thing you want is a brain drain in Singapore,btohqsg
It has been happening for the longest of time lol,btohqsg
