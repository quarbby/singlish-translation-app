Hi  I am a existing Citibank card member  can I apply for other Citibank card and eligible for the switch?,btohqsg
This is legit from Citi  I got a call from this number too the next day after I applied. They basically just want to run through the t&c with you and verify the welcome offer from whichever vendor you applied from,btohqsg
Does anyone know what's the best liquid savings account without any or very minimal conditions?,btohqsg
Thanks for reply  cause I checked the number and many comment about scam.,btohqsg
Trust ? 1.5% then use their card 5 time get 0.5% more,btohqsg
hsbc everyday global account (EGA)  just need to send sms to register then get 4.5%-4.7% interest for 4 months.optional: get 1% more interest for the first month if do 5 transactions (easiest FAST $1 out from EGA) and transfer in min $2k.,btohqsg
even FAST also count?? wah thats good!!,btohqsg
I've been thinking about OCBC Div+ at 3.3% or esaver at 3.8%. But esaver seems to be only on the monthly incremental balance which is a little confusing,btohqsg
Just read that must put funds in there until end June to get the bonuses interest and bonuses interest is only on incrmenrntal ADB,btohqsg
OCBC  div+ still the best option with minimal conditions at 3.3%? Anything better out there?,btohqsg
Dl the app and register first!,btohqsg
After 20 plus mins they auto hang my call,btohqsg
Wa... like tat citi is much better. Citi I never wait more that 10 mins,btohqsg
I did and waited for 2 weeks with no news,btohqsg
hi  can i ask are there still any products out there that offer 4% risk free (tbills/fixed d/savings),btohqsg
Do u know if u can use amaze + OCBC Titanium on dining? Would I still get points? Or only on shopping?,btohqsg
everything u put in now is fresh fund ah (if no deposit in Jan),btohqsg
only get 10x points for mcc in the whitelist in the TnC. Otherwise 1√ó points only.,btohqsg
If placing there 4 months  only first month Will get 4.5-4.7%  right because it is based on incremental fund. Hence  2nd month onwards will not get bonus interest. Correct?,btohqsg
no  all 4 months get 4.5%-4.7% cos reference month is in Jan.,btohqsg
Anyway to earn cashback on cc while topping up to CPF?,btohqsg
Does anyone know a good personal wealth manager in UOB ideally in Orchard or Tiong Bahru area?,btohqsg
+1  not sure if I have missed out any advice on this. Thanks.,btohqsg
Hi  May I know which Cc is good to use to pay road tax ? Tks,btohqsg
Road tax I believe accepts Amex right? Can use UOB Absolute  Amex TCB  Amex KrisFlyer,btohqsg
oh  then Amex TCB top up GPMC then pay with GPMC,btohqsg
Ok ok. TksAny idea if pay by DBS live fresh card  will I enjoy 5% rebate ?,btohqsg
Yes cardup works but I believe DBS Live Fresh doesn't earn 5% on CardUp,btohqsg
Hi  may i check that does it mean need to top up min 2K to enjoy the additional 1%? Tks,btohqsg
You just need to have $2k fresh funds (i.e. not from HSBC) transferred in. What you do with the $2k afterwards is entirely up to you. I typically just transfer the money out immediately,btohqsg
can i ask what is the best mile card for insurance payments? i read that maybank visa horizon is the option with 1.4mpd,btohqsg
Maybank Visa Infinite is 1.2 mpdMaybank Horizon Visa is 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
ohh.. tks for the correction.. üôè,btohqsg
any hidden clause for visa infinite?,btohqsg
Hi does maybank have promo gifts often?Wanted to sign up for Maybank Platinum visa but no promo currently? Thinking to wait or just sign up,btohqsg
There's a fall below fee if fall below $2k but other than that no need to maintain the fresh funds every month,btohqsg
You need to earn $150k and if you don't spend enough ($60k per year) they will charge AF (first year fee is waived),btohqsg
So the reference month is only in January? It's not reference to the month before?,btohqsg
from what I understand... this is under the everyday global rewards programme... which is 1% applied on the incremental adb when min $2k fresh funds added... for 1st month (if new a/c)  previous mth is $0... so the 1% is applied on the $2k or if one funded eg. $75k  the 1% applies on that $75k  but next mth  if u add in another $2k  the 1% interest will only apply on the $2k... since the incremental adb btw th 2mths is nw $2k only... you mentioned u tsfr out the $2k immediately... so they still gave the 1% interest on that $2k since it din stay in the a/c for the whole mth?,btohqsg
That's two different promos. You're referring to the interest on the incremental ADB which of course you have to maintain the balance in the account. There's another promo which is 1% cashback on GIRO and credit card transactions. Qualifying criteria for that is $2k fresh funds transfer and 5 transaction,btohqsg
yeah this wan is the everday global rewards prog right.. $2k fresh fund + 5 txns... so they still gave u 1% interest on the $2k even though u tsf out the amt immediately?,btohqsg
Of course not since it's based on incremental ADB,btohqsg
ahh? then u tsfr in/out is juz to satisfy the criteria...,btohqsg
I merry go round my funds with RHB HYSA... This month my funds in RHB. Next month will go back to EGA,btohqsg
We‚Äôre trying to build something like this withmax-now.comwith the help of public data and AI. we‚Äôre still working on the accuracy!,btohqsg
I have the oldest Citi cashback visa dan recently apply citi cashback mc  if I spend with mc card  can I use the cashback in visa to minus spending in mc?,btohqsg
Can anyone advise how OCBC 360 works for bonus interest?Like I have 90k of saving in there.But my salary deposit date is around 27-31 of every month.That means i am still eligible to receive bonus interest for my 90k at the end of each month because I am a bit confused.,btohqsg
dun think so  separate accounts  just spend the cashback,btohqsg
Keep both cards if possible  just in case of large spending. There are some people who keep both the Visa and MC version of Citi Rewards so they got $2k monthly cap,btohqsg
