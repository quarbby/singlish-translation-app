I am sorry for utterly messing up the GP paper. I deeply regret everything at I have done including my non-existent paraphrasing and my utterly hopeless attempt at the AQ which I unreservedly shoulder the blame for. In order to make amends  I will retake A level paper next year. Please forgive me. Once again  I am very sorry.,btohqsg
My fren wrote his essay with barely any news examples,btohqsg
He still got B for A lvls,btohqsg

Guys I just wanna know  science stream students  if your score can go FASS but not higher  will you choose FASS?,btohqsg
Non a sci stream student here but Iâ€™d consider going FASS,btohqsg
I have science friend who go art stream in uni,btohqsg
In fact one of my econs teacher is PCME + H3,btohqsg
But he end up studying econs,btohqsg
I am arts stream and I definitely want FASS haha,btohqsg
But econs is v quantitative in uni,btohqsg

Hybrid combi here but fass is quite good I think. Depends on the courses,btohqsg
Lowkey feel that FASS shouldn't group all their majors in one single place tbh,btohqsg
It disadvantages those of us that actually want to do arts that's not Econs/Pysch/Politics,btohqsg
