i think skoda looks promising now,btohqsg
Well  I not here to sell any brand but I can say this  during the 5 years I drove French vs. my friends Skoda  their cars all only wear and tear + clutch change. No MU or other major issues. And btw  Skoda SG replace my friend‚Äôs clutch FOC.Meanwhile for me:Picasso - 2nd layer oil leak (famous issue with this DV6 engine)  centre display fail  BPGA battery management box fail  gearbox actuator  somemore AD order parts just before warranty than after warranty end refuse to replace FOC  need to payScenic - engine no issues but I replace evaporator coil twice within 6 mths thankfully under warranty  each coil is $2+k. Just before warranty end I immediately sup chut kir5008 - as previously mentioned  unsolvable high FC  engine stalling,btohqsg
i just walk out of AD,btohqsg
Ya. I didn‚Äôt pay. Sold the car off üòùSo in a sense I damn heng cos each car chut its pattern while still under warranty‚Ä¶ feel bad for those who buy such cars with few years remaining and then kena hit with all the failures left right centre,btohqsg
No wonder dealers need to tah..,btohqsg
Yah‚Ä¶ and resale value so low.,btohqsg
Paynow company same as paynow own number. Just that use NETS or paywave like that then they charge commission,btohqsg
The commission isn't that big..? Unless your txn are small lah...,btohqsg
So if u paynow via UEN 0 charges ah,btohqsg
Okay guess Im wrong abt the charge,btohqsg
When it is time to pay   you need to pay .,btohqsg
