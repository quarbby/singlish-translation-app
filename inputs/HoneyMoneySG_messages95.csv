HSBC EGA account is where I park   promotional rate is 4.6% for March.,btohqsg
This one only for one mth right? Because the additional 1% is on the incremental balance compare to previous mth?,btohqsg
But the interest wil get on apr mth? Then u wil transfer out before end of mth?,btohqsg
Sounds like you're pretty conservative. If you'd like FD like options can try one of the many money market funds. You can even have a look at the one you can access directly from your UOB app.,btohqsg
It's a long term solution but you don't have to keep shifting money around and opening b accounts here and there.,btohqsg
Last published rates are ~3.7% I believe,btohqsg
Yea I got some stocks on paper loss. So trying to avoid markets related kind if possible. Do u meant those etf fund for uob app? Did not really explore the app.,btohqsg
Yes. Best way to play HSBC EGA is control 2 different humans. Then musical chairs between both of them using outside bank.,btohqsg
It's not an ETF. Think of it as a fund which optimizes fixed deposits.The risk is pretty low and the volatility is negligible,btohqsg
What do u mean by control 2 different human?,btohqsg
Ic thanks wil go explore it 😄,btohqsg
Yea got some suspension from penny stock too 😔,btohqsg
Have authorised access to 2 different human’s EGA accounts.,btohqsg
Oh okay understand. But the interest need to wait many mths or the following mth wil get it?,btohqsg
To confirm on tnc. Utility not allowed,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have about some fund maturing at syfe end of March. Any recommendations? Or T Bill still no 1 choice now? (I’ve used up Moo Moo 6.88 promotion).,btohqsg
hi guys if i take HBD loan  must the 80% of the cost of the HDB come from loan? If i have enough CPF to pay for example half of the loan  will my CPF be depleated first before the loan kicks in (i.e pay by CPF  then only 40% of the flat goes to loan),btohqsg
Guys anyone knows which option to choose?,btohqsg
I enjoyed the 1% bonus interest in my account in Feb and transferred funds to my partner's account in anarch,btohqsg

Only fast payment sala to uob can work. I did from posb,btohqsg
Yes  Hdb will completely wipe out your CPF OA first + your entitled grant  then Hdb will decide how much loan to give u,btohqsg
Must see tnc. Different promo different. Some is wait 2 months. Some is wait 5 months.,btohqsg
Did you read the terms to qualify?,btohqsg
Can put OA to investment before wipe out?,btohqsg
can but min 20k left in oa,btohqsg
Anyone knows whether moomoo or tiger can buy US bonds?,btohqsg
Yes read but a bit confused because usually if you open UOB one account  the requirement says  you need to deposit a minimum amount of $1000. So the fresh funds of $5000 is for the sign up gift right?,btohqsg
I suggest you read the terms again as it states clearly what promo it is and how to qualify for which.,btohqsg
I’m not sure about the banking terms. Thank you sir.,btohqsg

“Everything you put into crypto is considered lost” - adapt this mindset and you will be doing fine in crypto,btohqsg
Crypto retailers are coming back...can see ppl start asking questions....,btohqsg
When crypto price high every one keen  when low everyone quiet haha,btohqsg
What’s the saying…buy high sell low 😂,btohqsg
Ya  that is how people earn money  by reaping off those buy high sell low,btohqsg
You should only buy into what you actually understand. Not just because some stranger online says you should 😉,btohqsg
Same as stock mkt mah  when price low u will see ppl ask whether to sell or not. When mkt up 20% and valuation more exp liao u will see ppl ask which broker to buy s&p500 lol,btohqsg
All investment is about human emotional to be honest,btohqsg
This time crypto rally is different.Bitcoin is making ATH purely becoz of etf approvals in US  see other major altcoins they are not even near to their ATH.Bitcoin is the only one of safest among all  see big Institutions are investing it legally after SEC approval.Stock  gold they already have some %of portfolio of total investment  now money is chasing bitcoin to grab some pie of that portion.,btohqsg
Hi gurus. May I ask if anyone knows if tuition enrichment fee (Write connection) is it excluded from UOB one account as valid spending?I paid on 7th  posted on 8th  but today I check  the ticker in my app is still not moving. Does the ticker move on the posted day or the next working day after the posted day?,btohqsg
There is last update date on the tracker. Compare the last update date first.,btohqsg

Hi  may I know what’s a good card to use when buying air tickets in foreign currency?,btohqsg
Amaze + Uob lady card with travel category,btohqsg
If u dun have uob lady card  what the alternative card for booking air tix?,btohqsg
There isn’t any close competitor. Hence Uob lady is such a gem jewel precious diamond when it came up with travel 6mpd $3k cap.Even 4mpd $2k cap is still appreciated after 1st April,btohqsg
depends on which airline u are taking as well and how much u are spending in total for air tix,btohqsg
If lets say for SIA  any alternative? Does budget carrier have diff strategy?,btohqsg
Hi any suggestion for cc to spend $800 mthly on EYS clinic?,btohqsg
Hi is there comparison for BlackRock s&p 500 vs amundi prime usa fund for srs>endowus investment?,btohqsg
he did talk about the fees etc  what other comparison u asking about ?,btohqsg
S&P 500 is slightly less diversified  it contains only large cap but amundi prime contains large + mid cap. But diversification usually has an inverse relationship with risk/return  so depends what you're looking for.Fees-wise they're very close.,btohqsg
Can one pay another credit card bill with another card?,btohqsg
Anyone tried to buy Klook vouchers at ShopBack $500 size? What’s the mcc?,btohqsg
Hi everyone. If any one knows whats the reason why a credit spending is not moving the ticker of the uob app?I paid for tuition fee for my son..Or where shd i go to ask uob?,btohqsg
Possible to use empty Amaze wallet to try out?,btohqsg
I thought of doing so but if someone already did it then can just be 100% sure.Problem is I have heard of cases where the tested mcc for big sizes is 5812. Then after posted it is 7299 (the usual mcc for small sizes).,btohqsg
SIA lets say u are spending $2k u can opt for the UOB KF cc which gives u uncapped 3mpd,btohqsg
however u can break up the spending into different bookings and utilise all the 6mpd/4mpd cards such as the Ladys card and WWC until the capped amt,btohqsg
Maybe it fall under education mcc that is excluded spending,btohqsg
Hi for amaze card using overseas  is it similar to youtrip transferwise where the fx rate would be shown live right after the transaction was done?,btohqsg
Hi guys apology for the following silly question but bobian really new to bitcoin. Unsure if it works like stock.😚1)If I buy at 70k now and its dropped to 20k  does it mean I wld incur a paper loss of 50k + margin/card deposits fee/comfee etc?2) Where did the 50k gone? Disappeared in cyber space or like a zero sum game where the market maker or manipulator wld receive the 50k gain?3) Any recommended platform to buy bitcoin?,btohqsg
what card you use to pay ?,btohqsg
cards like uob amex are excluded from the spending tracker to be awarded for the bonus interest   if that is what you're referring to,btohqsg
It works like stock  except that there aren't any real physical assets backing it up 😉1) Yes of course. Same as any other traded entity.2) It's pretty much zero sum. But does it really matter whether the lost value disappears for good  or whether it has gone into the hands of a market manipulator?,btohqsg
substitute bitcoin with gold and you will get your answer?,btohqsg
"2) the ""50k"" could just disappear   if today people value it at 100k  but the next day the buyers value it at 10k  the value will just be down to 10k.So i would say its value is dependent on how much people value the bitcoin   which is different from assets like gold which is a tangible asset. bitcoin is a non-tangible asset as its backed by nothing but by ""belief"" . its like money   if nobody believes in its value   the currency drops tremendously",btohqsg
More seller than buyers = price drop,btohqsg
I am thinking value of bitcoin won't just disappear into cyber space..but became profit for those who sell below 70K? Getting confused,btohqsg
Was thinking bitcoin kena short selling by whales wld b getting more frequent,btohqsg
technically the value can just disappear if nobody values it but thats quite the extreme case,btohqsg
just make sure u know whats your risk tolerance level before getting into bitcoin   as its volatile,btohqsg
My number 1 rule in investment  u can afford to lose all and it will not affect your lifestyle,btohqsg
Heard if Internet down or during nuclear war? Other wise shall subject to demand supply,btohqsg
If ur investment goes to zero and it will affect u then u not suitable to do the investment.,btohqsg
if you are interested in knowing how bitcoin works   can try googling for how does bitcoin work,btohqsg
BTC is backed by the mining network that is securing the protocol.,btohqsg
Googling is easy. But that's why we value input here. Especially those with useful comment ❤️,btohqsg
cannot really explain fully   cause bitcoin is quite a complicated subject,btohqsg
Fundamental of investing is power by human emotion  fear and greed. Bitcoin is just an investment tools like other investment. So why some can hold and gain while other panic and lose,btohqsg
Nothing will working during these scenarios.,btohqsg
U can try balance transfer  bank do run zero percent balance transfer at time.,btohqsg
Only physical gold will work then,btohqsg
Weapons and food is what you need.,btohqsg
Yes and no...the mining network (and dependent costs like equipment and electricity) are what gives bitcoin some kind of price reference for valuation only when it is initially minted  but that is not what gives bitcoin its value after that,btohqsg
Survival skills is the core haha,btohqsg
"The keywords are ""securing the network"". Not sure about the future but nobody can create a ""fake"" BTC or double spend at the moment.",btohqsg
But if u follow that rule strictly. Very hard to get rich since u will only be in very conservative investments. Or invest very little.,btohqsg
Very many have tried to create alternate coins (with varied success). So the question I'm trying to drive at is why is bitcoin valued so much differently from the others? Surely the mining equipment  electricity  features etc. is not vastly different from some other currencies (and actually in some aspects it is even worse than some of the other currencies out there).Therefore my conclusion is that there must be a significant amount of non-tangibles (mindshare  expectations  etc.) that is giving bitcoin value.,btohqsg
i have seen alot of ppl burn before  consistently maintain holding power will build wealth steady. Not as if u want to be warran buffet next. I am contend with what i can build. U can land in trouble if u overestimate your cash flow and over leverage.,btohqsg
Anyway u suppose to invest extra and not the core asset u hold  of course it really differ depending on your age group,btohqsg
Hello everyone  does anyone know if you can earn 4mpd on public transport using amaze + citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Read the T&C and you too will know 😉https://www.citibank.com.sg/pdf/0124/rewards-card-2024-tnc.pdf,btohqsg
Ok I don’t know if it’s relevant but my personal experience is to whack all in when I was young. Into risky assets. Then as I got older I rotated the risky assets into conservative ones.I must say that the risky assets I was in when young. Would have affected my lifestyle for sure if they went bust.Even now. My more conservative assets if go bust will also affect my lifestyle. Just the chance of bust is much much lower than the risky assets.I would find it hard to put all my assets into only government related securities or bank deposits. Returns are far too low.,btohqsg
no  restricted   no flights   no travels no hotel,btohqsg
so okay  youdodo not earn 4mpd because Bus/ MRT MCC is 4111  which is in the excluded travel merchant categories of Citi rewards card?,btohqsg
oh crap. okay. thank you for letting me know 🥲,btohqsg
"5. (x) clearly excludes ""transit-related transactions"" 🤦🏻‍♂️",btohqsg
A thought is before we take up any promotions on saving accounts  credit cards  sign up deals  FD promotion  etc  read the T&C thoroughly to make sure we can fulfill the criteria with minimum changes to our spending habits and hassles and thus able to reap the most benefits from it. These are sources to build up our passive income and hence it is not productive to spend too much effort on this.,btohqsg
BlackRock is 0.38% charge and 15% withholding taxAnundi prime usa fund is 0.35% charge and 30 withholding tax.So BlackRock is better ? For now BlackRock s&p 500 not available in cpf but available for srs>endowus investment.Noted,btohqsg
I think you're muddling together two different issues:1. Which type of fund to buy (i.e. which index do you want to track)? Blackrock S&P 500 and Amundi prime USA track different indices  so it's like comparing apples to oranges.2. Are you buying US-domiciled or Ireland-domiciled? Ireland-domiciled will enjoy lower dividend witholding tax but will usually be subject to higher management fees. Need to plug in your projected numbers to make a decision as to which is better.,btohqsg
all this are excluded spending that will not be eligible for the uob's bonus interest,btohqsg
Chris literally compared  this two options in his video and BlackRock is recommended for srs. (For the layman they are similar and mostly cover the s&p500)S&P 500 at absolute lowest cost would be BlackRock option I guess,btohqsg
Can I clarify  you're asking for someone to explain further the detailed reasoning behind why Chris recommended the blackrock option for SRS?,btohqsg
Hi  i wanted to buy eurail (which charges euro) with the DBS women world card. Will this be counted as local transaction  4mpd or as FCY spending  1.2 mpd?,btohqsg
if i pair citi premier miles with amaze. does that count as local or FCY spending?,btohqsg
got it  thank u very much,btohqsg
Hi peeps  anyone did this promo? Seems good deal,btohqsg
Answer why Blackrock for Cash/SRS  Amundi for CPF are found in the article link.https://endowus.com/insights/sp500-index-funds-us-stocks,btohqsg
this is what happens when people abuse the system ☹️,btohqsg
I am sorry. I should have done some calculations myself. Chris video is quite self explanatory,btohqsg
So how. What other cards can get anything out of snack payments ?I understand Maybank visa platinum can get cashback,btohqsg
Both my uob Amex and cb Amex cannot top up Sian,btohqsg
Bobian alr  need use normal credit card to purchase snack alr. Provided their challenges still provide good rewards,btohqsg
Can someone explain how to milk 150k miles from snack? I thought the benefits are from cashback?,btohqsg
You only have until 13 march if you want toMilk something,btohqsg
Yea can explain how to milk miles? The rates are so low,btohqsg
Top up and get miles. Repeat,btohqsg
Why would u top up using a miles card when cashback card is better?,btohqsg
I don’t know. Don’t know how to use miles. I only followed gurus here that recommended the Uob Amex card which is now nerfed,btohqsg
It was on limited time once the news was spread  not surprised. Always enjoy it while it is available,btohqsg
I heard there is a cap they set on a per snack account basis.,btohqsg
I’ve just been told that my daily transportation does not qualify under the One Bonus category. Any tricks to share how all your spending is valid for One Bonus crediting?,btohqsg
If your daily transport is simply go it definitely qualifies for 10% cash back up to $1500 per month,btohqsg
It is under Simply go but bank said I spend less than $500 last month coz public transport is not counted.,btohqsg
Did u monitor your uob one account tracker ?,btohqsg
how do i do this with what card?,btohqsg
There's only 1 card that can do this haha unless u have black card,btohqsg
may i know what card please?,btohqsg
time for me to cancel amex card already 🤣,btohqsg
You like that cancel then next time got hack cannot capitalise,btohqsg
hi everyone  do anybody know which are the better bank account to credit salary? thanks,btohqsg
Your salary is the same regardless of which bank you credit it to 🌚😂,btohqsg
to have higher interest rates mah… hahaha,btohqsg
just don't credit to uob since can bank transfer for the interest,btohqsg
Technically Dbs is the lousiest bank to credit salary to.Because you only get it at 12am. While for some foreign banks and local banks  you get your salary one day earlier at 5pm.,btohqsg
And yes this matters if you can deploy your salary or bonus one day earlier (could be 3 days earlier if cross weekend).,btohqsg
Nope. Where to find this account tracker?,btohqsg
Woah u use wat card?? AMEX platinum ah?,btohqsg
How about UOB? I used to get at 3.00am-6.00am 8-10 years ago  while OCBC/DBS around 10pm to midnight  heard this from colleagues.,btohqsg
i came across stand chart jumpstart acc and e$aver acc with both competitive int rates. wondering if anyone in this grp utilizes those accounts?,btohqsg
I still keep my jump-start even though I'm much older than the cut off age. It's the only acc that I know with 2% interest which haven't rotiprata over the past 5y+,btohqsg
so its good to deposit savings inside right? since im going to start working and dont have much cash savings for now,btohqsg
Fuss free no hoops no minimum balance no minimum spend,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword“Uob tracker one account”to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey,btohqsg
alright thank you! guess its an ok strategy for now haha,btohqsg

Hi any idea promo still valid if after shares transfer into Webull  sold the shares and use the funds to buy other shares? Basically never withdraw the funds,btohqsg
If miles team then yup  if exchange rate team then maybe wise/youtrip/ichange/revolut/amaze wallet might be better,btohqsg
What you plan to spend on?How much you plan to spend?If you plan to buy LV bag  Rolex watch or pay hotel  definitely no.,btohqsg
Is this up to 3k or 3k,btohqsg
What are some platform you guys using for crypto trading ?,btohqsg
Wow. Who got a million in shares,btohqsg
If someone has more than a million in investments they are unlikely to be willing to plonk it into a platform like webull.,btohqsg
Hi  i would to check is Airbnb payment option (Pay part nowbajd part later) consider as 0% IPP and not be awarded points. Thanks,btohqsg
Hi guys. For UOB rising dragon promo  do we have to have the funds already in then register and fill up the form or register then have the fund declared deposited before promo end?,btohqsg

Hotel bookings using uob lady cc is not considered as part of the monthly 500 dollars minimal spending … ?,btohqsg
Hi all  just joined the group here. Am in mid 40s  and have not set up SRS acc  is it too late to do now to take advantage of the Tax incentives?,btohqsg
uob lady cc don't have a minimum spending fyi,btohqsg
Never too late. Actually srs shouldn't start so early.  My take,btohqsg
Oh i meant for the fulfillment ofthe uob one account interest,btohqsg
Most impt  do not let the money just sit in the bank,btohqsg
IMO  it’s never late to setup SRS and get tax relief,btohqsg
Another question  which do you think is the best credit cards to earn miles with local spending ?,btohqsg
depends on what u are spending on and how much is your estimated spending per month. All cards are good when defined and used correctly,btohqsg
I read there are others who got this? I believe as long as u don’t click it. It’s all safe still.,btohqsg
Any expert knows if I pay for drink or food using ShopBack + Revolution… can I still earn 4Mpd for Revolution card?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword“Shopback revo”to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
I’ve dialled in yesterday to their fraud team and informed them about it. They recommend getting a new card.,btohqsg
Yeah they sure will recommend that to play safe.But my thinking (open to discussion) is since 3DS blocked it. Still safe and I can keep the card intact.Reporting and replacing card damn troublesome. Must re setup a lot of things.Also I have 5 Citi cards. I can’t tell which one kenna.,btohqsg
Yup i got one yesterday too,btohqsg
They already know ur card number lol better change it.,btohqsg
Some transactions dont need 3DS to go through one,btohqsg
So once they try that  u may be screwed,btohqsg
The issue is with mulitple citi card u dont know which one is the one so have to wait and see. I got fraud transaction just last month with this citi 3ds  just replace then now again. Think citi is been targeted,btohqsg
Last wave was UOB. Now Citi?,btohqsg
Just call and ask citi which card lor they will know,btohqsg
Coz i kena before also with another bank  i ignore the 3ds  the next day  the frausters put another transaction through without verification,btohqsg
Eh. Just from this chat we can see at least 3 people kenna Citi fraud yesterday?,btohqsg
Ok this is a genuine risk,btohqsg
Actually what’s the rationale for the scammers to run the cards through a 3DS merchant first  instead directly through a non-3DS merchant?,btohqsg
Ya la. Now I overseas also. Imagine even I call in now and incur expensive roaming. I get my card blocked how I spend.,btohqsg
Maybe to see if the number is valid?,btohqsg
But charging through non-3DS merchant achieves the same I think. If invalid number then it will error out?I’m just thinking there’s a good reason (from a scammer’s perspective) to incur extra effort going through a 2-step approach  and it bothers me a little bit not knowing why 🤔,btohqsg
What comforts me is that it is mass attack. Like the recent Uob absoluteU call in bank for fraud resolution they already know what to do.No questions asked.,btohqsg
If it charges through 3ds merchants higher chance of prompting 2fa,btohqsg
Any one has experience with this transfer in promo? Pls share 🙏🙏,btohqsg
Thats why they like to test that n incur small charges first den mature the card to make it charge higher amounts but most of the time they get greedy and end up using a higher amount and you get notified of a high payment withdrawn but end of the day its a win win situation cause they get what they wanted you get your money back so nothing was ever lost even tho it may be a slow process of getting your money back,btohqsg
User🅰️GEM HULK🅰️has 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no ads,btohqsg
May be you need to chat with Webull CSO on this n share with us the result too.,btohqsg

Hi what the promo of webull,btohqsg
On the fraud topic  someone just charged SGD 2340 on Apple SG with my DBS yuu VISA card. Blocked  Reported and replaced card in progress,btohqsg
Wow just to share. Charged $21.15 on my Uob one card at MacDonald for 10% cashback. Not only did the transaction take 9 calendar days to post  it actually disappeared halfway (I track my usage manually especially last week of statement cycle) and I went on to spend another $20 on another merchant just to be safe. The MacDonald transaction actually reappeared! And after my statement cutoff date. lol.,btohqsg
Yeah many people got it. But it’s the 3DS notification only. Not an actual charge,btohqsg
Mine was an actual charge despite me locking the card,btohqsg
Assuming you’re holding to retirement anyways  earning additional 2% on top of whatever capital gains and dividends you would have received anyway  not a bad deal. It’s not funds that are being locked up  it’s investments.,btohqsg
dunno is it UOB problem. i had a xnap transaction that took 7 days to post when it usually takes only 1 day. same thing  the pending transaction disappeared for days. never had this happen with other cards.,btohqsg
interest rate for SA/MA/RA reduced to 4.05% in Q2,btohqsg

Ohhh...but the other account only yield 0.05%?,btohqsg
Or is there any other ways? I have both accounts. But mainly in UOB cause of interest.,btohqsg
Uob lady's card if select dining but dining merchat on UOB$ programme. So no UNI$ will be qualify right?,btohqsg
Will not get base points but will get the delayed bonus.,btohqsg
i got this too on Citi,btohqsg
Hi experts  if I have $10k to invest in local bank stocks  should I go for dbs or OCBC or UOB? OCBC is lowest in price which means I can buy more shares but what do u all think 🤔,btohqsg
Can also consider investing into money market funds to earn rates similar to high-interest savings accounts. But will not be SDIC insured,btohqsg
no leh  i have shopee and lazada orders that are still on the way and transactions posted already,btohqsg
SA  RA  MA drop back to 4.05%,btohqsg
i would say DBS  cause DBS biggest in SG,btohqsg
It happens to me. I left $13 to hit $1000 tier by end of today. Don't know why cold storage is so slow to post.,btohqsg
Yup. Depends one... Maybe need to chase them to post it by today cos today is the end of my statement day,btohqsg
Anyone encountering random 10cts deposited into their uob account. I have reported uob and they advised me to make a police report. I make a online report with phyiscal statement from uob  however  the police said is not under their jurisdiction. This is the 5th time am getting 10cts deposited,btohqsg
If police say not their problem. Then ok Liao ah. I will just let the money come my bank account. In sg  if the police not catching u  who else can catch u? 😂,btohqsg
Very worrying  could be criminal and stolen proceeds. Your account might be frozen. Pls escalate to MAS,btohqsg
Just looks dubious to me.. ? In uob statement  they state they cannot reveal why.. just odd,btohqsg
10cts ? What are these people trying to do..,btohqsg
Uob tried returning the funds but is rejected. Honestly  dubious. I have similar instance for PayLah where 30 dollars is cashed into my acct  i called dbs and they returned the fund and is successful,btohqsg
Doesn’t matter  maybe testing your account to see if it’s “active”. You should escalate to MAS asap. Refunds could be rejected cus the account is already blocked by the sending bank,btohqsg
Report to MAS. Like dropping an email to MAS ? Yes  I think they are testing my account to see if it’s active,btohqsg
Yes with the response from UOB and police statement. The worst case scenario is UOB freezes ur account for links with suspicious activity. Usually all accounts linked to a suspicious account will be seized / suspended for investigation so the email correspondence with MAS / police / UOB will help you prove your innocence and lift the blockage faster,btohqsg
Better be safe than be sorry. And I noticed the individuals are always Malays ie names of Malays,btohqsg
Can anyone shed some light on HugoSave platform ?,btohqsg
Are there any wallets that u use credit card to put money in  but when u withdraw the money  it goes to ur bank account?,btohqsg
Got a weird deposit of $2 myself before (for those weird “task”) raised it to UOB support after checking txn mismatch to reverse but nothing done too.. if u called in and ask do document it down somewhere just in case,btohqsg
Personally I buy from Silver Bullion’s online app -https://www.stargrams.app/en-sg/sg(also accessible viasave.gold),btohqsg
I guess if it’s a one time transaction  is okay I guess. But I experienced this for approximately 5 times  over a span of 3 to 4 months. Is strange  I agreed is a test water situation where these peeps are testing whether my account is active. The fact that the funds cannot be returned  is probably closed due to possible unlawful activities.,btohqsg
I read typically accounts are closed due to amounts in and out of accounts in amounts larger than the threshold set within the banks and from third party providers like crypto where laundering is common.,btohqsg
Could be new tactic lolTest PayNow if number is active  if active then target...But yeah on banking end  see whether can flag to MAS lo (Do highlight u did try to ask for a reversal so it's not like u intentionally kept the funds),btohqsg
Happened to my Agoda grabfood singlife  transactions too,btohqsg
Maybe to confuse  investigators too ? lol cus they spam a whole web of accounts then can’t trace,btohqsg
"Possible (this is usually the ""layering"" process in money laundering terms)But overall idea is to be careful since you are potentially-targeted in some sense...",btohqsg
Oh yeah a lot of them actually use paynow account info to scam. I got a few scam calls where they asked if I was my paynow account name,btohqsg
Does polyclinic count towards uob one card?,btohqsg
No  but if u pay thru healthhub it counts,btohqsg
If u pay at polyclinic the mcc is excluded  if pay thru healthhub the mcc is not excluded,btohqsg
Do you happen to know if it applies for trust card  hsbc as well?,btohqsg
u need to check bank own tnc each bank is different,btohqsg
Hi if I am going USA for holiday which credit card should I use for my normal expenses like food and shopping?I am using the UOB pink lady card travel categories for my flights and accommodation.,btohqsg
Depend on what card u have on hand and if u will apply just for this trip,btohqsg
Hi i only have limited cards on hand and I don’t mind applying.Citi bank cash back+  OCBC rewards card  OCBC 365 card and just applied the UOB pink lady’s card,btohqsg
Uob vs signature up to 2k for foreign currency  uob ppv mobile contactless up to 1.1k. Citireward plus amaze up to 1k. All 4mpd card,btohqsg
Really depend on how much u be spending over in us. But the good thing is uob uni dollar pool together in one acct,btohqsg
Also to avoid the foreign transaction fee  using the amaze +citi reward plus will be better right?,btohqsg
Amaze still have fee just less then use card directly,btohqsg
I believe around $2k overall for food and expenses +shopping,btohqsg
So there is no card that totally avoid the foreign transaction fee right?,btohqsg
U can opt for trust  youtrip  revolut  ichange  wise all these but no reward,btohqsg
Snack by income no longer accept amex. Are there any other investment platform that accept amex true cashback card as payment?,btohqsg
if you avoid the fee  you will lose on spread. so either way  it is never going to be optimised,btohqsg
With 4mpd card u still have net gain after fcy and u dont need to have money out of pocket first. So either u choose better rate or credit card reward,btohqsg
So if I use the above credit card I will still have net gain after the FCY,btohqsg
believe someone asked this same question ytd  u can go search it up in the chat,btohqsg
i also tio today onlyCiti fraud,btohqsg
What I fear is Citi suddenly tighten their security. Then overseas transactions or those paired with amaze may start failing,btohqsg
Just got  the exact same  push notification as well. Called citi and block card.,btohqsg
i think citi credit card no is getting brute forced,btohqsg
Those who are manually making CC payment to CITI do also take note to pay earlier. Usually they take 1 working day to clear. But this month 3 working days still not cleared.,btohqsg
I also got a fraud transaction on citi today,btohqsg
citi sent notification to approve fraud transaction. click cancel and lock card. hopefully all good,btohqsg
I was charged by Apple  no notification and went thru despite card being locked,btohqsg
same. Called Apple over 3 days keep asking me to wait that i just call UOB reort fraud and replace the card,btohqsg
Right  btw can UOB cards be locked?,btohqsg
Yes. U can do it via UOB Tmrw,btohqsg
Go to the card  settings and block the card,btohqsg
I had a fraudulent transaction with uob absolute cc more than a mth ago  after reporting the trx  I went ahead and blocked the card. As soon as this is cleared  I cancelled the card.,btohqsg
modify the alert notification for cc transaction via citi apps to 1.00,btohqsg
I literally just got my new card less than a week ago 😂 haven’t even made my own legit transaction and I’m already getting fake transactions…,btohqsg
Hahahaha at least they trigger to authorise... My uob card also few weeks kena straight deduct one,btohqsg
I’m not taking any chances 😂,btohqsg
Oh oops didn’t know that was an option 🤯,btohqsg
Hi  i would to check is Airbnb payment option (Pay part now  and part later) consider as 0% IPP and will not be awarded points from UOB lady card? Thanks,btohqsg

Hi gurus  I’m going overseas for a month. Any good credit card (for miles) to consider?,btohqsg
Dang  just now I received a push notification from citibank cc to approve a random $1000 transaction... Lucky I didn't approve.Should I block my cc?,btohqsg
Block the card immediately thru the app. I called citi afterwards to request for permanent block and replacement card. Happened to me last Sunday with Citi PM,btohqsg
F***. I just replaced it last Feb.Ok  better safe than sorry,btohqsg
How much do you expect to be spending? Is it a holiday or more day-to-day stuff?,btohqsg
I can’t find any content targetted at this so wanted to consult the gurus here. My mum is under the old cpf retirement scheme. Is it worth it to switch her over to cpf life?,btohqsg

She currently have half of FRS but we intend to top up to FRS for her,btohqsg
Hi  is it wise to utilise my CPF OA funds to purchase t bills 6 mth now if i want to buy a house later this year?If t bills can give 3.5% p.a and hdb loan is 2.6% p.a  can’t i just invest all the funds in cpf oa and get a cpf loan at a lower rate?,btohqsg
can i pm u a link ?,btohqsg
That's one way to put some cpf OA away from rainy days ... Before hdb wipes out your OA for the hdb,btohqsg
day-day stuff. looking at maybe spending 1-2k for the one month,btohqsg
Also  separate qn  can citi premier miles be paired with amaze  and use the amaze card for payment?,btohqsg
I saw the T&C if it’s just for food  groceries and shopping in a foreign country  should be can right?,btohqsg
U can pair but premier only give 1.2 mpd  wont cover the amaze spread,btohqsg
When u pair it is charge in sgd so consider local spend,btohqsg
Ahh I see so if I were to get a CC to be used overseas for shopping and day to day use what should I get?,btohqsg
Use uob visa signature up to 2k,btohqsg
Okay but because this is not a MC I can’t pair with amaze and would therefore be subjected to foreign conversion fees?,btohqsg
Yes but it is 4mpd still got net gain,btohqsg
People view 1 miles to be 1.5 cents usually. So 4mpd card is 5 percent cashback roughly. So after 3.25 fcy still get 1.75 net gain,btohqsg
Okay understand thank you for the detailed explaination,btohqsg
Sorry just wanted to do a sanity check.. for the UOB visa signature I can spend on any MCC when using foreign currency? Can’t seem to find the T&C for their whitelist/ blacklist,btohqsg
Usual exclusions. For dining & shopping so long can use contactless payment should be no prob,btohqsg
Oh the 4MPD is only entitled for contactless payment?,btohqsg
To be on the safe side as i used for max 2k transaction,btohqsg
No. Contactless  Petrol or FCY. 3 different categoriesRead this:https://milelion.com/2023/05/04/review-uob-visa-signature-card/,btohqsg
Thanks for the article  for the FCY category no blacklist MCC?,btohqsg
Exclusion applied as per tnc. But usual spending for fcy during travel should not be excluded,btohqsg
Hi all  any suggestion for payment of the booking fee (10k) for car purchase? For now can only think of citi miles card..,btohqsg

HI guys  I have some USD to transfer to from Tiger to Webull. What is the cheapest way to do it?I already have a DBS MCA. But when i try to send USD from my MCA to Webull USD account  DBS charges me about $19 service fee. Is there anyway to avoid that?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword“Dbs webull transfer”to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg

Same  I had so many transactions disappearing halfway  and taking 4-6 days to get posted.Can I check  I just received EVOL cashback yesterday. Is that for Jan-Feb spending  or Feb-Mar spending? Thanks!,btohqsg
my DBS MCA to webull is free  did you use DBS Remit?,btohqsg
Haiz... now my turn... sibei sian keep on need to block and replace for a new card,btohqsg
I think citibank kenna all the fraud shit now....,btohqsg
Managed to settle. It's funny when I try to transfer via desktop browser  I'm being charged for $19 fees. But when tried using POSB app  there's no fees.,btohqsg
Yea someone else mentioned desktop charging too. Good that it’s settled now,btohqsg
Few of my friends kena unauthorized transaction on citibank cc past few days. Same to me ytd. Saw the notification  did not authorize then block and kill switch the entire account. Apparently  once you block old card and report  for an instant  new card number will appear (only can see the last 4 digits)Then call citi hotline  they say will replace a new one within 3-5 business days. Then today  receive messages on OTP  for payment of a new card (not even received). Something is really wrong with citibank. Major security breach.,btohqsg
I got th same one too,btohqsg
I called them and they say there is no need to get the card replacement,btohqsg
I think this is the mass fraud and they are aware of it and investigating it...,btohqsg
Better replace  your card details got exposed alr,btohqsg
There is no point to request for new card now right  if the scammers can still access new card number,btohqsg
Tbh  i really don't know leh. Gonna call citi and report this. At least they aware,btohqsg
I kena last month too  once also a year ago. Both on the citi cashback+ card  i have never kena such things on other cards before. they are not secured bah,btohqsg
Just called. They say no need to replace the replacement one  as the card not activated yet  no way can be used,btohqsg

Hi  wat your take on investing in gold,btohqsg
"No way to be used  yet the card details are already compromised and Citi say ""it's fine  go ahead  use the compromised replacement card""?",btohqsg
Hi all  any suggestion for payment of the booking fee (10k) for car purchase? For now can only think of citi miles card..,btohqsg
Called Citi and they blamed it on Master which doesn’t sound right. It’s only “Citi” Mastercard got breached!,btohqsg
"Hopefully you got the name on record? If not  reach out to another CSO to confirm their ""no replacing of compromised replacement card"" policy (and record the call if possible).This is to cover all bases in case future fraud hits and Citi decides to play games with zero liability policy.",btohqsg
With so many people affected  actually is there really a need to get so worried? I mean not like it’s isolated incident to just a few people.And from what I see (myself included) no actual charges went through.,btohqsg
can consider splitting payments across various credit cards,btohqsg
A quick check Citi + Amaze combo. N use amaze card overseas. All transactions less travel related like hotel. Car rental etc. Will.earn 4mpd right?As long as within 1k limit,btohqsg
Perhaps can refer to TnC what are excluded?,btohqsg
Yes  if you don't mind the foreign exchange rate. But check the t&c for the exclusion  mainly is Travel stuff and the norm exclusion,btohqsg
What is the best multi currency card to use in Korea? I'm not a mile chaser  so Amaze would be out for me. So maybe comparing between iChange and revolut,btohqsg

hi.. referring to this uob dragon promo. if have 100k in my uob one acct  n  i never zero out  if i were to top up another 100k  just to confirm that only 100k would be ear mark? after the ear mark  i would be able to withdraw 100k right?,btohqsg
You don't really get much more bang for cashback cards  and they generally don't need amaze. I already have FnF 8% for dining  BOC Family 10% for dining  and ocbc frank 8% for fcy... Don't need amaze. Thinking of pairing with another multi currency card when I hit the spend limits,btohqsg
U will fail the earmark condition of maintaining $100k above 31 Dec balance.,btohqsg
he top up another 100k already  why fail,btohqsg
Why don’t zero it on 28 Mar or 30 Mar? Another 15-17 days to go.,btohqsg
Increment in account day-end balance must be maintained even through earmark period,btohqsg
We are assuming the next round of promotion happening on 30-Mar. Also  no point trying to catch the current round of promotion.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone used YouTrip to withdraw cash from overseas ATM? Is there any hidden fees? Will it show the exchange rate before confirming to withdraw the cash? Thanks,btohqsg
Ya. No point lock the extra $100k there n earn nothing.,btohqsg
I understand if I use credit card directly.  Its like 3.25% charge.N if use via amaze got some reduction. So end up paying abt 2.5%.My dining category in uob ladies is 6mpd. So I guess it's still.worth it.,btohqsg
My thought is instead of using Uob one account and potentially losing interest if the promotion didnt happens cos you empty out  Can we use the stash account instead? Keep it to minimum amount $1k. When the promotion happens  transfer in 100k and after earmark  transfer out leaving $1k inside. It is less hassle to manage and trying to guess the next round of promotion as well.,btohqsg
Hey Just want to check  if I spend just $600 on online spend for UOB EVOL  will I still get $40 cashback or just $20 ?Any one kind enough to give me some clarity.Thank you 🙏,btohqsg
I also use amaze pair with citi cashback. With 6% dining  groceries cashback  still better than youtrip  trust etc.,btohqsg
Yup..cos.you trip.doesnt earn any pts. But good thing is good exchange rates. N no.fees,btohqsg
If you plan things correctly  you will only lose minimal interest if you empty out at the last few days at the end of the quarter and the promotion doesn’t materialise.You could use your stash acct instead  but then the question is where is this fresh 100k coming from  and what is the opportunity cost. Cos if you use UOB One it’s almost 0 opportunity cost since the money would have been sitting in the UOB One account anyways  with or without the promo.,btohqsg
but stash if withdraw early then the balance drop will get the bonus interest?,btohqsg
The highest level technique is to have balances above $100k (for example $108k) for 28 days of the month. Then last 3 days u can keep it at $10.And ADB is still 100 0xx.xx and u get the full 5% pa interest.I use excel to calculate. Use whatever method u are comfortable with.,btohqsg
Hello everyone! I’ve just joined here after seeing YouTube channel! Hope learn a lot here 😃🙏,btohqsg
That will a good approach as it negates the losing of interest for the last 3 days and if the promotion didn’t materialize,btohqsg
You need to plan correctly such that your 27 or 29 days out of 31 days of MAB this month is higher than previous month 29 days of MAB.Eg. If last month your MAB is $100k  this month you need $114815 of MAB if u plan to zero it on 28 MarIf u plan to withdraw on 30 Mar  u need to have $106897 of MAB till 29 Mar.,btohqsg
Hi can I check for uob krisflyer to pay insurance using cardup will it be considered 3mpd?,btohqsg
If I have spend 800 in krisshop,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword“Cardup calculator”to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
before 30 march  i will top up 100k. i plan to withdraw the 100k once the funds has been ear mark. so after that it will have 100k earning 5%pa  and get the cash rewards of $558 after 4 months. is that correct?,btohqsg
Thabks but the cardup website only uses the Base 1.2mpd to calculate but didnt say if 3mpd is eligible or not,btohqsg
Cardup said all eligible cards only earn base miles. No bonus miles will be awarded.,btohqsg
You cannot withdraw while the funds are earmarked,btohqsg
Maybe he meant withdrawing the 100k that isn’t earmarked,btohqsg
I got 1 too. From some hotel in Finland. Called them and they said no actual transaction so it's ok. They will make a note and forward it to the relevant department.,btohqsg
In this scenario  what is your Dec 31 day-end balance? Note the T&C states that you need to maintain the incrementon top of the Dec 31 day-end balancethroughout the earmark period.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/180050,btohqsg
It’s also repeated here “You are required to maintain…”,btohqsg
I got the physical card and also cannot link with amaze,btohqsg
Anyone can help to confirm it is counted as online payment if I am using shopback + evol card?,btohqsg
can show the amaze transaction ?,btohqsg
Amaze for me last week was 3.44 and 3.45,btohqsg
Weekend was only a spread of around 1.85% for MYR. Shouldn't be that bad leh.,btohqsg
i think the person counted wrongly the transaction rate? deleted message 😅,btohqsg
Actually half wrong. It is 16.85 for $4.90. But still inferior to direct use UOB lady for RM$68 to $22.28. I think for malaysia  UOB has a superior exchange. Infact XE showing $22.10 for Rm$68,btohqsg
uob still have 3.25 fcy ?,btohqsg
If they count in later when not in pending it be not as good I guess.,btohqsg
from what ppl say  is count aftrr,btohqsg
First time use UOB cc for me overseas. I use Citibank don’t have all the additional fee added,btohqsg
You haven't factor in 3.25% FX fee. And if MYR suddenly drop below 3.5 when your transaction posts then you'll feel the pain,btohqsg
Ah sorry for being a noob,btohqsg
And your original image shows RM78 not RM68. If factor in current FX rate and fees  you'll be paying $23.07  which the effective FX rate would be 3.38 instead of 3.5.Your amaze effective FX rate after spread is 3.43  which is better than 3.38 from UOB.,btohqsg
Why does citi rewards card reject the linking to amaze card,btohqsg
I just activated so maybe ill give it another day,btohqsg
Can I confirm that is possible to trsf ocbc 360 to uob 1 for the purpose of salary crediting ?,btohqsg
Am not sure how paynow works but I will think it works only where one’s paynow mobile number is tagged to ocbc bank account. If the paynow mobile is tagged to other bank and not ocbc  there is no way to trsf to uob 1 as salary payment ?,btohqsg
Instarem card spend at foreign country and if I tied to credit card  if I go to supermarket  and my UOB lady card choose grocery category  I will get the cash back   right ?And if my husband UOB lady choose dining  and we pay by Instarem for restaurant and link to his credit card will get the cash back too  right ?,btohqsg
Hihi  does this mean amaze transactions are excluded from citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Amaze * ezlink is excludedAmaze * transit,btohqsg
Same thing here. Tried to link my digital replacement crmc received today to amaze but got rejected. Able to connect to Google wallet though.,btohqsg
Only those Amaze * ezlink/ transit basically you cannot use it for SimplyGo or EZ-Link it will not be rewardsThe rest of amaze not affect~ it a standard across many of the banks that still allow amaze transactions,btohqsg

Hello! If I'm intending to book tickets from Korean Air  will DBS Woman's World Card be the best choice?,btohqsg
Depending on the amt u be spending and what card u currently hold,btohqsg
application of credit cards doesn't materially impact credit scores. unless you're applying 7 (not scientifically proven) within a month. even so  it'll recover pretty quickly,btohqsg
I currently have UOB Lady's (but it's under Dining  not in time to change category)  and Citi Rewards + Amaze! The tix is around $1.5k,btohqsg
cause the person talking about the credit score said it wasn't important  probably the wording and the phrasing is incorrect and the person is just trying to say what u said,btohqsg
Yup then dbs women is the best as citi rewards exclude travel spend for bonus,btohqsg

I'm using a Standard Charted Unlimited Credit Card that earns me a 1.5% cashback on all spends. No minimum spend. No cashback cap.I'm considering changing to the OCBC 365 Card that offers a 18% discount at my usual Caletex petrol station.I do like the idea of unlimited cashback as I easily charge more than $900 on my CC every month. Is the switch a wise choice?,btohqsg
If you’re only spending $900 per month you shouldn’t be looking too hard at unlimited cashback cards yet  because your spending is very close to the limit of specialised cashback cards (that offer a much higher rate) that you come out behind.For example  if you used UOB EVOL and were able to maximise its benefits with the minimum spending required  you would be able to get $40 cashback with ~$600 spend. Currently your full $900 spend at 1.5% only gets you ~$14 of cashback.,btohqsg
You have to ask yourself - are you looking to maximise your benefits (at the cost of additional effort)  or do you want minimal effort (and give up some potential benefits). Then you will know what is the wisest choice for yourself personally,btohqsg

If I have redeem for  miles partially  meaning no longer as per 5 years from initial date  will that correct? Assume they use first in first out concept,btohqsg
The main thing is ipaymy charges $1 for every payment. It's literally 0.1% more if the transaction is $1k. Higher % in fees when the transaction is smaller. 0.2% if $500  0.4% if $250.,btohqsg
Hi guys can you advise what is the minimum balance for uob one account please?,btohqsg

Perhaps could contact CSO for further clarification. According to Milelion article  points accumulated 5 years period starting from card approval date  will have 5 yrs + 3 months expiry period.Annoying thing is I seek confirmation from CSO via mobile app chat  they revert requesting me to call in instead. Perhaps it best to track and check every monthly card statement to prevent points expiry going into waste 🤔,btohqsg

Hi everyone. I have participated in the Rising Dragon promo. Had 10k on 31dec  so I topped up to 110k last month. I just noted today my available funds has decreased to 10k +$558.I understand that i am still going to earn interest based on a $110k amount.But.. i am not sure if its ok to withdraw this remaining $10558. (I would like to do so becos anything above 100k is giving only 0.05%p.a.)Anyone knows?,btohqsg
By the same logic as I always have this question in mind  if I have $100k on 31 Dec and I put in another $100k to make $200k for the promo. Once ear mark I can remove $100k n just leave $100k for the earmark. So even if 31 Dec we forget to empty the account we still have a chance,btohqsg
True also.. but then it means if we participate the 2nd round  deposit on 28th feb  and got earmarked on 15th march  means the extra 100k put in will lose around 15days of interest that could otherwise earns around $210 in another 5% uob one acct.This understanding correct?,btohqsg
So the earnings would be effectively $558-$210=$348If this is correct  this would serve as a reference for those still interest to go into the round 3 rising dragon promo,btohqsg
but it's hard to know when they earmark your funds so during the period of waiting time you waste interest,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows if I were to use the UOB One Credit card to make payment for a Shopee Pay Later (SPayLater) bill  will I be able to get it to count towards the monthly spend and whether or not this amount will be able to earn the bonus 5-6.67% cashback on Shopee transactions? Thanks!!,btohqsg
I think the earmark takes like half a month to happen,btohqsg
1.6 “Incremental Fresh Funds” means funds in the amount of S$20 000  S$50 000  S$100 000 or S$200 000:(i) in the form of non-UOB cheques or non-UOB cashier’s order;(ii) that are not transferred from any existing UOB current/savings account; and(iii) that are not withdrawn from any existing UOB current/savings account and re-deposited (whether part or all of the amounts withdrawn) into the Account indicated in the Registration (as defined below) at any time during the Promotion Period.Note:(a) For existing Accounts  the Incremental Fresh Funds must result in at least a corresponding increment in the Account’s day-end balance throughout the Promotion Period and Earmark Period as compared to the 31 December 2023 day-end balance of that Account.(b) For Accounts newly opened during the Promotion Period  the 31 December 2023 day-end balance shall be zero.,btohqsg
5.3 If UOB determines that you are ineligible to participate in this Promotion or to receive the Cash Credit and/or Prize (collectively  the “Benefit”) under this Promotion  UOB may in its sole discretion forfeit the Benefit  reclaim the Benefit or charge to and debit an amount equal to the value of the Benefit from any of your accounts with UOB without prior notice to you.

So is it ok to withdraw or not?😵‍💫,btohqsg
I would not.I would obey the rule where account balance = 31 Dec balance + $100k throughout entire earmark period.But I’m a play safe person. And I have not faced any issues with reward fulfilment.,btohqsg
Cos u already got the $558 and ear marked 100k,btohqsg
If any doubt just consult the CSO...,btohqsg

yes earn base miles/points if using fee paying citi payall,btohqsg
Does it count as qualifying spend for the rewards? (gifts),btohqsg
To be exact  it cannot be called earn miles  it shall be called buy miles via Citi Payall if you chose to pay the Citi payall fee. No paying fee  no miles.,btohqsg
Hi for UOB UOB Rising Dragon Savings Promotion which needs to lock in for 4 months if I have $100K in my account do I need to transfer out for one day or couple of days and transfer in? When I transfer out will it affect my OUB One Account monthly bonus? Thanks,btohqsg

I wonder am I correct. Based on tnc  paying singtel bill and singpost services are excluded from uob one account bonus interest and card rewards. Not sure why it considered as qualifying spend under uob one account bonus interest. So that means they are qualifying spend for uob one card cashback reward?I tried singtel bill payment with ocbc 90N and it awarded me ocbc miles too.,btohqsg
SingTel bills will earn 3.33% cash rebate on Uob one card and move the Uob one bonus interest counter.,btohqsg
Oh so singtel is not excluded transaction for uob one cc. Always thought telco and utilities are generally excluded,btohqsg
SingTel bills are not excluded for almost all credit cards that I’m aware off.However  telco payments may be excluded from many adhoc spend and redeem promotions,btohqsg
Yes. Just Vietnam not many place accept card.,btohqsg
Oh how does it work ? So hsbc revo is 4mpd and using it with kris means 5mpd (extra 1mpd?)and every transaction will be converted to contactless/online payment automatically?,btohqsg
And I believe another condition is your parents should not have more than 4k salary for the year.,btohqsg

Hi guys any though of Singtel stock.,btohqsg
May I know does anyone apply for this loan? EIR 5.43% mean of if I borrow $100k and all I have to pay is $100k X5.43% = total interest is $5430 no any other extra fee ? Am my calculations right ? Thanks 🙏🏼,btohqsg
So mean my tenure is 5 years is $5430X5=$27150 ?,btohqsg
May I know what is the difference between Annual interest Rate 2.88% and EIR 5.43% ?,btohqsg
U have to pay $1907 x 12 months x 5 years$1907 x 60 = $114 420,btohqsg
The mechanics of compound interest over a period of time. So EIR is more accurate,btohqsg
2.88% is the interest rate charged on the original $100k even if u have repaid a portion of your original loan,btohqsg
So total interest I have to pay is only $14420 ?,btohqsg
EIR is effective interest rate which factors in what u have repaid.And 5.43%pa is the true loan rate u are paying over 5 years on $100k loan,btohqsg
“Only”?$14 420 interest on $100 000 loan which u need to repay a portion of monthly…. Is a lot.,btohqsg
A bit confused I borrow 100k and the total interest is $14420I thought 5 years tenure is 100k X 5.43%=$5430$5430X5=$27150 ?,btohqsg
No. Because every month u are repaying $1907 (mix of principal and interest).,btohqsg
Oh I see . Ok ok 👌🏼,btohqsg
So if u think about it.At year 2.5  actually u only owe Uob $50k but u are still paying 2.88% interest on $100k.,btohqsg
Simply just count $100k x (2.88% x 5) = $14400. That's your total interest. You'll have to pay back $114400 for the $100k loan in total. Divided by 5 years (tenure)  and 12 months (for monthly payments)  rounded up to $1907/mth.,btohqsg
