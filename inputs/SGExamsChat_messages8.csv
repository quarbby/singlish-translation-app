Simi how do u even write personal statement,btohqsg
They just want your personal information,btohqsg
since when uni app need personal statement,btohqsg
Aren’t you two in the same camp anyway,btohqsg
just fill in the form what,btohqsg
i think just randomly type a few words,btohqsg
is anyone here applying to pharmaceutical science,btohqsg
if ur rp way beyond course cutoff,btohqsg
what if it's like those AAAA kind for IGP,btohqsg
the personal statement is relevant only if u rly jz nice cutoff,btohqsg
ok la that one diff story,btohqsg
i went biz so dunnid write la,btohqsg
decided not to since its career suicide,btohqsg
pharm science is too underdeveloped locally,btohqsg
rly working in a pharmacy counter,btohqsg
u are better off pursuing chemistry instead,btohqsg
u don't even get to work at the counter as a pharm sci grad,btohqsg
also not say very developed in sg,btohqsg
ye  but I cant imagine firms like GSK hiring bachelor grads in pharm sci,btohqsg
i wont  if i was from GSK,btohqsg
when i ask him what he wants to do,btohqsg
he says 'go overseas and become a radio dj',btohqsg
wanted to go there  but i just noped out after thinking,btohqsg
just like pharmacy  ur career is almost guaranteed to be a stand still,btohqsg
t u i t i o n :),btohqsg
technically all undergrads in uni are doing 'tuition',btohqsg
its called 'tuition fees' for a reason,btohqsg
ye u see pharm sci in US  so much future,btohqsg
in sg  lul....theres only so much u can go,btohqsg
help me decide if cs or chem,btohqsg
I think GSK will still hire pharma sci grads?,btohqsg
nah  if u realised they are progressively moving out of sg,btohqsg
ok guess i have 16 more days to think about it,btohqsg
but i would pharm sci is intellectually stimulating,btohqsg
but if u realised its like a business analytics degree,btohqsg
u study 2 diff disciplines to a certain depth  but not deep enough. So u are a jack of all trades  but a technical master of none,btohqsg
I hope I won't regret my choice,btohqsg
bc i applied for nus scholarships,btohqsg
but obvly it wasnt good enough with the rank points,btohqsg
theres a key phrase they are lookin out for in the essay,btohqsg
maybe ba  im not sure of the rp cutoff for biz,btohqsg
but ik engineering is the lowest for both rp and ib,btohqsg
r e j e c t e d,btohqsg
rp cutoff for biz is 78,btohqsg
why not do chem and specialise in med chem?,btohqsg
I thought yu need 90 for NUS scholarship,btohqsg

good time to be a liberal arts student 🤩🤩🤩,btohqsg
I like how NTU biz and cs ddp is worth lesser than an NUS cs degree,btohqsg
Is this from the annual graduate survey or smth?,btohqsg
The top degree programmes this year are medicine  computing and law  in that order.A surprise is the average salary of Yale-NUS Bachelor of Science with Honours graduates. At a whopping $7 139  the degree programme ranked 1st in our ranking table. However  if you check the survey results  the data was based on a small sample size. The high average could be due to just a couple of extreme outliers.In the top 10 of our latest Graduate Employment Survey ranking (excluding the Yale-NUS one)  law clinched 3 spots. Medicine  computing and business 2 spots each.In terms of employability  Music  Industrial Design  and Art Design & Media ranked at the bottom.,btohqsg
maths only for people who want to become teachers,btohqsg
"""So you wanna be a teacher in the future?""",btohqsg
So those who can handle maths are instant geniuses,btohqsg
explains why they cant do GP,btohqsg
I intend to be a surgeon with my maths training!,btohqsg
One of my FM classmates was on school team for debate,btohqsg
With my linear algebra and graph theory knowledge  I will intend to become to world class patisserie!,btohqsg
And what does simping in the group chat mean,btohqsg
i wasnt referring to that...but ok,btohqsg
Hahaha attacks the mathematician by claiming that his anecdote is an outlier,btohqsg
Imagine knowing what the r means,btohqsg
So what are you doing here,btohqsg
It’s not about the knowledge but the skillz,btohqsg
It’s not necessary nowadays to go into a field related to your degree anyway,btohqsg
I wish it was that easy,btohqsg
Or else i need not make a choice right JOHN,btohqsg
but someone else here is also doing it,btohqsg
i'm reserving only the kinky stuff for u ;)),btohqsg
if I go into advisory  time to be the 10th percentile for salary :smug:,btohqsg
have u met anyone who is doing student ddp with comp sci as 1 of it?,btohqsg
wdym student ddp as 1 of it,btohqsg
why the median and 75th percentile so close sia defu,btohqsg
basically he/she studies comp science and maybe another degree that is not offered as a direct ddp program at first year,btohqsg
like maybe comp science and life science ddp,btohqsg
i actually hardly know anyone who's doing ddp,btohqsg
who wants to sign themselves up for such torture,btohqsg
is it possible to do comp sci as a double major?,btohqsg
all my friends that i've met are all single major  just 1 double major in math,btohqsg
theres no such thing as student initiated double major?,btohqsg
i think double majors are quite flexible  but depends on the faculty in question whether they want to give to you or not,btohqsg
but usually double majors dont really increase employability right since the uni transcript doesnt show it,btohqsg
unless u explicitly state it in ur resume,btohqsg
also got to see whether can fit into your schedule plan  if not might need to overload or take extra sem,btohqsg
So there’s no way to guarantee a weird double major during uni application?,btohqsg
uni apps usually give a fixed choice only right,btohqsg
im not that worried for chem and comp sci double major. Heard ppl doing this,btohqsg
Looks like I have some emails to make,btohqsg
i asked them for 2 yrs whether i can do a student ddp comp sci and chem on admission,btohqsg
and they were like..... NO NO NO NO NO,btohqsg
maybe it's really physically impossible to complete within 5 years,btohqsg
ok but i'm not sure of the stand for a 2nd major,btohqsg
its a student ddp technically right,btohqsg
supposedly that has to be applied once 60-80MCs are completed,btohqsg
from what i see is like you can do modules towards that 2nd major  then beg the faculty to give it to you,btohqsg
Double major only applies for subjects that have overlapping modules right,btohqsg
or else how do ppl do chem main degree and comp sci double major,btohqsg
double major is not double degree LOL,btohqsg
That’s why I’m asking about double major,btohqsg
only one way to find out,btohqsg
ppl said that abt BCME in JC like no life gg leisure time  but in the end nothing much,btohqsg
well you can try ba  i won't say it's impossible,btohqsg
i just say that it's agonising,btohqsg
agonising != impossible because many have done it,btohqsg
1.5 times that of single degree,btohqsg
i rly dk what to study,btohqsg
lol can't help you here  you yourself got to make the decision at the end of the day,btohqsg
u enjoying what u studyin tho?,btohqsg
Ye boi no ragrets even tho i get torn a new one every sem,btohqsg
Cause uni content is not easy,btohqsg
But uni is easier than Rick and Morty,btohqsg
HONESTLY U NEED A RLLY HIGH IQ,btohqsg
something something i forgot the rest,btohqsg
To be fair  😆😆😩😤you have to have a very high IQ 💯😏🤓😜to understand Rick and Morty.,btohqsg
😤😩💦❤️The humor 🤣😂👍👌is extremely subtle  👉👌😻and without a solid grasp ✊💪😫🍆💦of theoretical physics 👁😱😤👀most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head.,btohqsg
Actually IDK about you I alr got cancer by posting the partial copypasta,btohqsg
It’s just intensity and number of certs you get XD,btohqsg
Double major 1 paper  double degree 2 paper,btohqsg
Double degree 5 years I think,btohqsg
5 years max covered under Tuition Grant  technically you can take as Long as you want just fees only.There are legends who finish in 4 anyway.,btohqsg
Apparently it's only if you wish to be considered for ABAS,btohqsg
Feelin cute  shall try for 3.5,btohqsg
OK time to try complete my ddp in 4.5,btohqsg
I just included it because I'm scared I cmi lol,btohqsg
after I took H3 chem I no longer have that huge of an interest in chem anymore,btohqsg
Isn't there chem in pharma science though,btohqsg
it mainly focuses on organic chem,btohqsg
I dunno what to fill in for 2nd choice for NUS,btohqsg
1 out of 2 above  67.5 right,btohqsg
Lets just say i was the lower half,btohqsg
Wow u did better than half ur class,btohqsg
This nigga didnt even reach 67.5 bro,btohqsg
The “better” students in ur class sub 70,btohqsg
If only uni accepts me for my h1 grades,btohqsg
If you accept an offer from NUS this year can you proceed to reject it next year,btohqsg
If u look at pharm sci mods  theres very little chem mods,btohqsg
I think there's chem in the mods just that they didn't show it,btohqsg
Pharm is in the middle honestly,btohqsg
I like med chem as well,btohqsg
Isit a sgexams sin to give tuition now,btohqsg
