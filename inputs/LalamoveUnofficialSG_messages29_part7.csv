Llm app also bad.Today took job. Pick up address is Westgate. But shop at Jem.Deliver to tuas. Postal code & actual address is 2km away. No block/unit number also. I almost want to throw away the food liao. ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘,btohqsg
Er.... Maybe last timeNow u see the jobsCannot take btb liao,btohqsg
You navigate to your map from the app?,btohqsg
That 5 sec is to force u to read the remarks,btohqsg
U need to wait till the button light up then press confirm again,btohqsg
One of those days everything also salah,btohqsg
1st llm job. Prob last. Hahaha,btohqsg
Who ask u go tuas ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
I gg pioneer for work mah. Was thinking not bad can cover abit. End up waste time. + climb stairs somemore. ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Mean once we swipe is tt we get the job  only depend on us to final cancel or cfm the job ðŸ¤”  today I swipe the job but was looking at the scroll part  than job disappear ðŸ¤£ after I check at on going section whether I get this job bo  but show nothin...2nd job I swipe  and wait for the cfm button up  then I press  then I was assign the jobThis seem to be quite fair as for those who accidental swipe for jobs we mistakenly swipe,btohqsg
They jus want ppl to read the remarks laBut that 5sec damn kan cheong cos another driver can snatch the jobI only staring at the button never read,btohqsg
One more question Bro  for example if both of us swipe at the same time  means both of us got an equal chances to press cfm buttonOrOnce u fastest finger swipe  u will be given a 5 sec to consider or give up the job ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Nope the 5sec not exclusive to youIf another driver swiped 2 sec earlier he gets to confirm 2 sec earlierWhich would be when u still staring at the button to light up,btohqsg
Oic  technically when we swipe and we must decide fast n keep trying pressing the cfm ðŸ¤£ button at shortest time possible.OrPress cancelOrjust leave it to expires...,btohqsg
Cannot make it fasterThose 5 sec u jus waiting to see your fate only ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
OK  as u mention if other ppl swipe 2 sec before u  technically u loss 2 sec for that  even wait for 5 sec  once they cfm  u still loss out... Am I right to say tt  ðŸ¤” unless the eariler party didn't do any action n let it expires  then we got the opportunity to wait 5s n cfm...,btohqsg
Thats why those 5 sec very irritatingLast time u finger fast can celebrateNow finger swipe fast then still need to pray no one take the job while the 5 sec ticking by ...,btohqsg
Yalor  haha  is like having second chance ðŸ¤£ but I do like the expires  especially when we swipe the wrong job  for example Car accidently swipe a Van job  just let it expires or click cancel n move on... No need to call CS or customer explain like shit... This part I do like it...,btohqsg
Haha ya i think thats wat they trying to achieve also,btohqsg
You need to experience the stephen chow inspiration la,btohqsg
Actually LLM can make it more simple 1st swipe to take order.2nd  5s to read3rd  cfm button show up and press cfm.Or.Just leave it to expires after 5s without tt cancel bottom part...,btohqsg
