Any recommendations if want to topup to revolut?🤔,btohqsg
any ways to check the mcc before paying?,btohqsg
If it’s one time payment and not recurring then it sounds terrible,btohqsg
Hi can i check does 7eleven accepts Amex payment?,btohqsg
I don’t - I only ask the different FIs the MCCs after paying.However you are inclined you may temp block your DBS card  use their chat bot and ask about the MCCs of transactions - usually not the four digit number but a description next to the amount and merchant etcGood thing about DBS is they have WWMC which is a great card regardless of (most reasonable) MCCs.,btohqsg
any idea what is this for? randomly got credited into my UOB one CC,btohqsg
Yea it's one time payment. The cx service for Citibank mentioned telco is not included. Not sure if they are changing or something different with myrepublic.,btohqsg
Depends on the different 7-Elevens  I’d say the closer ones to me don’t accept Amex. Strange because isn’t Yuu card Amex ?,btohqsg
Oooh. Then it’s 🤨 puzzling. Would be very wary.I don’t know whether charging on Amaze card makes any difference,btohqsg
quite clearly citi customer service is smoking u,btohqsg
Eh... Then how do I get my rewards properly credited in this case if it's blocked by the cx service. =(,btohqsg
No 7 eleven dont take amex,btohqsg
I could tag Instarem Amaze to my Citi Rewards card  I was actually thinking of this. What if Amaze screws up? Who is going to own the screw up?To my horrors this happened to some folks.I applied for Citi Rewards (and DBS WWMC) anyway. When not using my Amaze card I simply tag to wallet and “lock” my card.,btohqsg
May be a good idea to lock the card when not in use,btohqsg
Also if screw up happens even with your vigilance  do consider raising with Firdec.Even if Revolut has audit issues and the business environment isn’t conducive to challenger FIs to shake the competition  we still can make the most out of what we have.,btohqsg
My thoughts. I experienced a fraud transaction attempt on my amaze 1 week after I had received it  and I had never used the physical card at that time. Attempt from some gaming website in the US. Their support just told me to request a new card. Ive lost trust in Amaze after that.,btohqsg
"I also tried instarem for a remit transaction (as they had $20 discount for first time) and it was a horrible experience. They told me the receiving bank had ""technical difficulties"" after 5 days. Then asked for my bank statements and source of funds before refunding my money from instarem to my bank after the failed transaction. DBS did the exact same remittance in 2hrs no hassle  but of course slightly expensive",btohqsg
Basically that's their response. No investigation,btohqsg
I think can use limit the amaze card to use in-store purchase ?They have several likeonline purchaseMagnetic stripOversea transaction,btohqsg
Lock AmazeI always lock everything when not in use and unlock when I am using the card,btohqsg
This is good idea! Can just allow in-store purchase!,btohqsg
I think might be a good way to really limit it to only in-store payment,btohqsg
Gg amazing really amazing hack Care,btohqsg
FYI once you link your card to instarem  it can NEVER be removed unless you add another card. So I will just assume my linked card has been compromised and request a new one. But just a heads up to others from my experience.  :(,btohqsg
Oh this is bad and can't link to another virtual card too to temporary fix guess either cancelled amaze or tell your cc card to issue a new card,btohqsg
Exactly and they have the audacity to recommend this. I am just glad to be out of this before harm done,btohqsg
He sounds normal what  just straight to the point and say I want this done  can you do it or not? If someone is holding my card details hostage you better bet i'd be even more pissed off than that,btohqsg
Can add Revolut virtual Mastercard (if you have one) to Instarem and remove your bank card,btohqsg
May i ask  wrt to instaram issue above.,btohqsg
Spending of 44k on homedepot. Are we able to set a daily credit of $500 a day? Means no transaction above $500 allowed in a day?,btohqsg
You should be able to set that in your bank app,btohqsg
I know POSB/DBS allows you to set spending limit,btohqsg
Which means she didnt set any?,btohqsg
that seems to be the case,btohqsg
Hi can we top up Medisave using CPF OA?,btohqsg
I don't think u can post referral link here,btohqsg
Is paying for handset re-contract in M1 Shop a eligible transaction? Let's say for HSBC Revolution,btohqsg
A dp: I paid iVisa using Trust Card thinking my Oz ETA sure Kena no reward but I’ll save on FX anyway. Surprise  have LinkPoints :)Almost automatic approval  Singapore citizen with only Singapore passport,btohqsg
One way i can think of circumventing this is maybe we can link our GPMC to unlink the cc and then lock the GPMC? But havent tried this so not sure if its a possibility,btohqsg
I giro pay Singtel bill to my EVOL card.,btohqsg
I called Singtel to confirm. Alternative  you can check with UOB Chat  but only for bills already charged to your credit card.,btohqsg
no wonder under others  could have paid monthly online to earn online rebate.,btohqsg
cannot add other prepaid card to Amaze,btohqsg
Anyway  for EVOL  max cb for online is $20 (max spending $250)  max cb for mobile is $20 (max spending $250)  so just giro Singtel bill to clock $100  to meet min monthly spending of $600.,btohqsg
Anyone know if Citi rewards card added to ComfortDelGro  grab etc.. does it consider as online?,btohqsg
If I wanna signup for instarem  just use ur referral link? No need to key in any referral code?,btohqsg
This is good. Thanks for the idea!,btohqsg
anyone got forex broker to recommend?,btohqsg
I think manually pay online count,btohqsg
Hi does the 6% SC smart credit card applies for online fastfood?,btohqsg
Oh it works? I thought trazora said cannot add prepaid cards,btohqsg
Oh. Link to other prepaid cards. I think possible la. GPMC cannot use Revolut (MC version) or EZ-Link digital MC lor,btohqsg
Can link Revolut virtual disposable MC or EZ-Link wallet MC to Instarem and remove the other card. EZ-Link wallet will be better since they decline all payments made via Amaze,btohqsg
Only whitelist like mcd. Kfc. Lots of other fast food not applicable.,btohqsg
This is a brilliant idea 💡 especially the link to EZ-Link Wallet thing,btohqsg
Does paying >2k Rent with CardUp using HSBC Advance get 2.5% cashback if hit all the prerequisites?,btohqsg
iirc all HSBC cards don't give rewards on CardUp payments,btohqsg
I mean can it be used for Online purchase for the eligible fastfoods,btohqsg
Hi just a qn  i have the hsbc revo card and im trying to split a big item transaction. Does the bill cycle resets at the end of the month or 4 weeks after receiving the card? ( on the 12th etc),btohqsg
Posting date   end of the month,btohqsg
Not sure if this is mentioned previously… EzLink app is currently running a scratch and win event… user with simplygo ezlink and simplygo concession binded is eligble to join… seem like the give a scratch card for each transit ride… FYI…For me the cashback i get from each card is around 0.02 to 0.88…,btohqsg
Anyone know if Citi rewards card added to ComfortDelGro  grab etc.. does it consider as online?,btohqsg
Have usd in visa virtual card. Anyone has any ideas on how to cash out?,btohqsg
Can I also ask for amaze  when you turn on overseas transaction  Citi rewards card also need turn on overseas transaction?,btohqsg
hi guys  for spending on iHerb (which involves foreign currency transaction)  which credit card is recommended? I m thinking of using Citi Rewards Mastercard (to pair with Amaze). Will it earn 4mpd as i think they are considered online spending?,btohqsg
Just curious  not all vouchers qualifies for the cimb promotion?,btohqsg
Hey all! New here haha. Don't mind me  will lurk for a while,btohqsg
Just tried. Update: can't link GPMC with Amaze. I don't have the Revolut temp card or EZ link wallet but those may be worth a try...,btohqsg
Guessing here but I feel like Amaze will override CRMC's overseas transaction disabled as citi treats amaze overseas transactions as local online spend...,btohqsg
Which is a better card to pay off utilities bills(Starhub  SingTel  M1)? UOB One Credit card or Standard Chartered Spree card?,btohqsg
uob one if u can meet the spending requirements for the quarterly rebate,btohqsg
Is it me or cimb visa signature can't be added to gpay wallet,btohqsg
try revolut disposable/physical card? I think those are in MC. Only the virtual is Visa,btohqsg
Depends on card type and issue... I have the premium as a visa and the metal as a MC,btohqsg
now only revolut disposable is mc  the rest are all visa,btohqsg
unless u have their physical mastercard,btohqsg
Wa they change again. Cannot keep up with their changing all the time. My physical standard/metal is still MC.Dk whether they will change the existing cards to VISA and I can get an extra metal card 😂,btohqsg
They mail me revolut visa card recently.,btohqsg
Is it standard card or metal?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA $5000 transfer is a lump sum or total per month?,btohqsg
For trust bank account  in the app if you are union member  would it show 2.5% even after having done 5 transactions? Or app only shows 2% regardless of union membership?,btohqsg
Hello morning!For the HSBC EGA bonus interest  it makes sense to top up only 1st of every month? Won’t make sense to top up now as it’s near the end of the month to get the most interest? Thanks!,btohqsg
Any red envelope pic ? For the Huat pal scanner ? All doesn’t work,btohqsg
Does paying electricity bills under uob one consider under $500 spendings?,btohqsg
Last 4 digits of mobile no.,btohqsg
anyone know how to transfer krispay miles to krisflyer ?,btohqsg
Think u nddd to add recurring,btohqsg
Not sure if just paying it will earn points,btohqsg
If u are referring to the savings account  then it should count into the $500Insurance counts into the spendings too,btohqsg
Can Grab pay later earn miles on CRMC + Amaze?,btohqsg
U can only do that within 7 day of earning the krispay miles,btohqsg
ahh okay thanks  late by 1 day 😢,btohqsg
Only possible within 7 days after the eligible transaction date,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for sc spend categories does telco bill payment consider? (Sc bonus saver),btohqsg
Not sure if I mentioned this before but Trust Bank is having a promo where u can get $2 rebate for paying via ShopBack QR charged to your Trust Bank card. Thats $2/5x100%= 40% discount.Can claim up to 4 times per Trust Bank customer. Claim your coupons in the Trust Bank app under Rewards. U need to redeem manually each time before u pay via ShopBack QR. Make sure to double check during checkout that your default card is the Trust Bank card. I had to manually select it again even though I set it as default payment card earlier.Promo ends 31 Jan 2023.,btohqsg
I was charged quasi cash by grab,btohqsg
How to tell the first date of every quarter?,btohqsg
Hi folks which credit card(s) count annual professional membership fees( CPA  PMP  CIA  etc) and training/tuition fees as eligible spend?,btohqsg
Anyone is oncircles.life? If yes  will it get 10x rewards using CRMC via amaze?,btohqsg
If theres a contactless terminal  UOB PPV or VS should be safe,btohqsg
Can try Amex cards like Highflyer  TCB  UOB Absolute,btohqsg
Currently cny now HSBC offers the shorts time with highest interests rates?,btohqsg
Thanks Chris. I only have the Amex krisflyer blue.,btohqsg
I applied for the HSBC a week ago 😭😭 haven’t reach me,btohqsg
Anyone knows? Im thinking of moving most of my lines over to circles if get 10x and if not getting 10x then not worth the switch.,btohqsg
Not sure. But if you are moving to circles  you can use $13 cashback on shopback for circles sign up,btohqsg
Can check w UOB via chat assist,btohqsg
I currently on circle  going to cancel it  need to wait 2 months to cancel  lots of hidden promotions  no clear faq about promotions  5G unstable  4G network slow,btohqsg
Although they on m1  m1 has a better 5G n 4G network,btohqsg
If u ok with it's then u stayed on LoR,btohqsg
Ye m1 still worst but circle life is shittier than m1 own self n the promotions they have is always misleading new customers,btohqsg
Currently on starhub and have about 6 lines cause all my family park under my name with broadband,btohqsg
Looking for good and cost effective plans,btohqsg
Gg to cancel but they have a policy to stay with them for 2 months before can cancel,btohqsg
Don’t take plan with contract  take sim only  more cost savings,btohqsg
Yea. Im deciding on that then i see circles family plan. Looks promising promo,btohqsg
Do a calculation and u still save when u sign sim only and purchase a phone at retail price,btohqsg
Their customer service is another shit thing,btohqsg
But better than SingTel customer service,btohqsg
Thanks for the feedback. Shall rethink again.,btohqsg
No problem  I got scam by circle life promotions without any faq on the promotion,btohqsg
Whenever there is promotion telco will have a page abt the promotion faq but for circle they don’t have any  they only have general faq which does not cover their promotion. Example: they always like to give “unlimited data” as their promotion  but when u sign up it is not even unlimited data  they only give u 80GB of data with data roll over,btohqsg
My latest experience with Singtel cS is pretty good 👍,btohqsg
Shop is still ok friendly  but call is terrible especially outsource call  is from sg than still ok,btohqsg
Yes  I’m on call  had issue with login to their portal,btohqsg
Hi I just joined. Happy Chinese new year to all! 🧧,btohqsg
Is instarem amaze stacked with city credit card better then hsbc revolution card?,btohqsg
I prefer hsbc revo as it’s only 1 party instead of 2  unless not under the whitelist,btohqsg
Anyone has referral link for instarem amaze? I would like to apply now,btohqsg
Hi any idea how can i pay my insurance now with uob aboslute?,btohqsg
revo is better since no round down,btohqsg
Use the referral links from my affiliate group att.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
Hi  anyone used DBS Live fresh student card to pay for spotify? Saw its 5% but iirc  spotify is processed overseas so have dcc? Anyone got insights? Thanks!,btohqsg
Most likely have DCC lor. Cancelled that some time back,btohqsg
DBS Live Fresh card has 3.2% DCC.,btohqsg
Sigh no avoiding DCC. When I was a student I only hoped to get an Amex card soonish to avoid DCCs.,btohqsg
Assuming you spend $9.90/month  that means you'll be charged $10.22 ever month including DCC. After cashback is credited you'll have spent $9.725 in total,btohqsg
which is still the highest effective cashback among student credit cards  even better than SC Jumpstart + Amaze,btohqsg
Yep just enjoy the live fresh student card while you can. Remember to cancel one year before graduation though  and temporarily use a debit card like Singtel-Dash Visa card (digital only),btohqsg
also doesn't singtel dash visa not give any rewards?,btohqsg
Benefit from New To Bank offers,btohqsg
Just an example ma.1. It is one of the few prepaid cards you can use to link to Apple Pay and make the most out of Kris+. google pay also supported. GrabPay MC is another  equivalent card for Android phones  I suppose.2. It does give rewards if you Heng Heng scan Dash all the time in Sheng Siong  FairPrice and Cheers.3. You might be invited to GXS faster on Dash than on Grab given the lowish take up rate on Dash. GXS seems perfect for students.4. I am not very sure whether Revolut still issues MasterCard as they issue Visas again. If that’s the case then there is no use case for Amaze haha,btohqsg
I see  thanks for your points. I think SC Jumpstart is also a good card to have for students  same cashback as Maybank evibes,btohqsg
HSBC EGA 5 eligable transaction can i like transfer any amount out of the account 5 times ?,btohqsg
Just to check through online banking able to place fixed deposit with such offered rate? Or need to go down to the branch,btohqsg
For hsbc ega  must I deposit the first $5k this month or next month is fine?,btohqsg
Creating acc online also need 5 business days. Go down direct easier and faster,btohqsg
Regarding HSBC EGA promo  for $5000 deposit  is it a total deposit per month or must it be done in one transaction?,btohqsg
I think the month it got approved,btohqsg
Does anyone know where can i applyUOB12NEWduring shopee checkout with uob CC?,btohqsg
At the order payment page  input as voucher.,btohqsg
is anyone doing the Fraser miffy exchange here?,btohqsg
Anyone having issues with kris+ challenges? It shows nothing on the challenges page.,btohqsg
They removed the daily check in challenge,btohqsg
Regarding the signup bonus for EGAHow to go about the trading account any tricks ?,btohqsg
This is one of the risks with Instarem Amaze. Best is to unlock the card before you paywave  and after paying  straight away unlock.,btohqsg
What’s the difference between in-store purchase and online purchase btw? Also  should I disable online purchase for instarem amaze and use my Citi Rewards instead? Is the 1% cashback worth the risk?,btohqsg
I have asked they said online purchase is for buying stuffs online  In-store is physically using paywave or insertAll still be coded as online transactions,btohqsg
How about setting spending limits on your CC?,btohqsg
Yes  you can set limit  but say you set 1k  you still lose 1k from fraud. Better to have both precaution I feel.,btohqsg
I tried with Citi  seems like they don’t support this feature as well,btohqsg
I think can just lock the overseas purchase and just enable the in store purchases,btohqsg
Yeah this is the best way for nowOnly enable instore purchase and disable online transaction since you are only using CRMC + amaze for the purpose of changing it to online and if online might as well use citi directly unless buying stuff then temp open then closed after finish purchase,btohqsg
amaze gives additional 1% cashback though  right?,btohqsg
Only on foreign currency transactions. Plus they use their own exchange rate which is ~1% from mid market rates,btohqsg
I see  thanks. When overseas  do you guys use Instarem Amaze?,btohqsg
Im frequest shopping groceries in jb using amaze,btohqsg
Hey all! Just wanted to ask  which card would be the best to use for overseas Grab to also earn 4mpd? (Ie Booking rides)I have the DBS womans card & Citi rewards card + amaze card.And im not sure what overseas grab is categorise as (like travel or still online or…) 🤔 And im in Vietnam so majority of the grabs im taking can be below $5 🤔Thank you in advance! 🙆🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
Amaze with citi rewards should be fine for overseas grab,btohqsg
Alright got it. Thank you so much!,btohqsg
Hey guys! Is there a limit to this 3.48%?,btohqsg
How long does it take for the monies to be topped up?,btohqsg
Hmm weird… doesn’t seem to reflect on my side,btohqsg
Did it appear on the main or pocket? There’s 2,btohqsg
Neither my friend! Topped up main acc,btohqsg
Ive highlighted to the team. Let’s see!,btohqsg
Sigh 😥 so many nerfs this year,btohqsg
Does amaze change sp services bill payment into online spending?,btohqsg
Ouch. Now that grab axs is disabled and grab top-up absolute card is 0.3% is there any good way to pay sp bills?,btohqsg
Excluded MCC take priority then check if it online or offline,btohqsg
Some credit cards have cashback for recurring utilities payment like OCBC365 and UOB one and UOB Evol  but have minimum spendOtherwise  I think SP accepts AMEX iirc  can just pay direct w UOB absolute or Amex TCB directly mah,btohqsg
Silly me.. I keep thinking of amaze card. Forget I can just use absolute card directly lol,btohqsg
=) yes yes  telcos and utilities are okay to pay without axs iirc (not too sure about the various electricity providers)its usually insurance and tax and town council payments that are more problematic,btohqsg
any of u pay condo mcst bills using credit card?,btohqsg
I tried  axs mobile or desktop can't use amex absolute card :(,btohqsg
i tried to add the credit card number in on the mobile  but it only caters to 16 number credit cards. On desktop  there is no option for amex cards  when i tried uob cards  it doesnt caters to 15 credit cards number for absolute card,btohqsg
O.o very strange  i have linked my amex tcb for payment on the SP appcant rmbr how i do it but it is there still on the appamex should be can for SP payment,btohqsg
SP app can use AMEX for payment. Absolute get 1.7% cash back.,btohqsg
Sorry didn't see it's sp app,btohqsg
decent… but sadly  no 5G support yet,btohqsg
Is there any promo to apply ocbc 360 FD? 4.08% for 10k in 8 months?,btohqsg
Any other better offer for FD between 6 to 12 month?,btohqsg
Penny stock must buy 100 shares  might as well buy a legit ETF like A35  MBH  ES3  G3B which lot size is only 1. Less volatility too,btohqsg
Wait I can buy G3B then sell ? ?,btohqsg
Trading fee is $25 right ?,btohqsg
Just buy. Don't sell.Just that I not sure whether hsbc incur any custody fee. I also ask same question as u .Maybe u can find out after cny and update me too.,btohqsg
HSBC lot size is 100 for G3B ?,btohqsg

That can bah will do the same,btohqsg
You choose cash or item ?,btohqsg
Town council can use gpmc directly,btohqsg

based on the 4.35% bonus promo t&c by sms register  the yellow highlighted portion....,btohqsg
does this mean if u sign up the singsaver promo  then this bonus interest promo will then be invalid?,btohqsg
Hi all  since Citi Rewards/ DBS Woman's card all have cap for 10x points...what cards would you all use for purchases bigger than 2k?Looking to purchase some furniture hence the amount will likely exceed 2k SGD,btohqsg
Likely need to use a few cards. Uob VS plus dbs wwmc enough?,btohqsg
Thanks! For UOB  which are your preferred cards? I currently only hold the ONE card but gonna apply for a miles one soon too,btohqsg
"not sure if ocbc titanium rewards is suitable for you  if you're buying ""furniture"". IKEA/courts also got furniture..",btohqsg
I haven't use it  so maybe someone else can confirm,btohqsg
but UOB have preferred platinum visa  mobile contactless/onlineup to 1k+? 4mpd,btohqsg
uob visa signature also  if you can hit requirements. For UOB cards  need to dodge UOB merchants,btohqsg
I’m not UOB supporter 😆. Yup if u go ikea courts ocbc TI card is good enough.,btohqsg
Thanks! What do you mean by dodge? :),btohqsg
Ocbc TI have deals with IKEA and courts eh?,btohqsg
if it's UOB merchant  don't use UOB miles card. Not sure about their cashback card,btohqsg

Anyone ever draw $ from trust from atm overseas? How is the rate? Not in usd,btohqsg
Sorry   a bit slow in getting the point. If its a UOB merchant  the perks is less?,btohqsg
you will not receive any UNI$ for uob merchant. UNI$ is the points you use to convert to miles,btohqsg
I did in Thailand. The rate is near to youtrip minus the withdrawal fees,btohqsg
Overseas even better. Data roam included,btohqsg
How much is the withdrawal fee?,btohqsg
Minus withdrawal fees means no fees,btohqsg
hi  do atome payments count as online spending for DBS live fresh?,btohqsg
But can appeal to dbs to consider it as online on a case by case basis,btohqsg
Any credit card. That offers cash rebate for Ryde app?,btohqsg
Hey gurus what is the best CC to use for shopee. Would prefer miles over cashback.,btohqsg
Is there a minimum spend for this card?,btohqsg
Max $13335 per year for 4mpd. No minimum,btohqsg
Also verify if the online spend qualifies for the 4MPD for the OCBC titanium,btohqsg
Thailand have atm fees. I think depends on country and bank.,btohqsg
Can check the fee free ATM list on Revolut forums,btohqsg
Hi  May I know if purchase ShopBack voucher using HsBC revolution can get 10x points ?,btohqsg

Guys for pure no frills cashback  Standard Chartered Simply Cash and Citibank one still the best right?,btohqsg

How do i check my dbs altitude card application? Any idea?,btohqsg

How to check HSBC credit card application status?,btohqsg
There is an option to check application via the HSBC hotlineOtherwise  it usually takes 1-2 weeks now. Download the HSBC SG app as usually your card shows up there b4 the formal letter is sent,btohqsg
Any card that give any cash back or miles for insurance payment?,btohqsg
Do you need to register an account for HSBC app?,btohqsg
Yeap! Dunnid card number/HSBC account to sign up  just Singpass,btohqsg
Anyone knows how do i set recurring payment for singtel on uob one?,btohqsg

Watching your latest YT video now on How to travel to BKK cheap on budget.Nice video. I just came back from BKK early this month  nice place to travel.,btohqsg
Hi all. Any comment on the POSB Everyday card? Been using it for quite a while.,btohqsg
I only find it useful for public transport rides with no min spend required  but even then SC Smart beats POSB Everyday at 6% cashback. The $800 min spend is too high for me,btohqsg
no min spend for posb everyday 5% for simplygo  7% for sheng siong  3% for watson  up to 5% for recurring utility etc,btohqsg
Thanks. My take is that I just want to be simple. Consolidating my expenses in a single card  accumulating n utilizing the rebates to offset my future purchases. Used it for iphone purchases previously with zero $ by offsetting n recontracting. It might cost a bit more but it's not affecting my monthly bills. Offsetting it for petrol purchases n even my motor insurance of late also seems a good deal for me.,btohqsg
To each our own. If you aren’t on the Trust ecosystem I think the  POSB everyday card is decent,btohqsg
So the $800 min spend applies to dining  online shopping and telco?,btohqsg
for those who is using uob one and yr quarter is oct to dec... have you received the quarterly cashback yet?,btohqsg
Hi which credit do you use for telco  electrical bills  settling of healthcare invoice? thank you :),btohqsg
do u know that quarterly cashback will only be credited if u have card bill to be offset,btohqsg
oh is it?.. so if jan no bill no credit? I thought it would be credited into the card acct,btohqsg
UOB Absolute gives 1.7% cashback for everything except grabpay top up (0.3%),btohqsg
yes can check their website  quite clear,btohqsg
Hi all  which is the best miles credit for petrol?,btohqsg
Was thinking of using the citi rewards master card w amaze. Would that give me the 4mpd? 🤔,btohqsg
Next  as I'll be buying lots of new appliances for my new house  I'm also looking for a credit card to earn miles for these purchases. My current card (HSBC Revolution) has a max limit of 1k for the 4mpd rewards,btohqsg
I didn't know UOB no longer have JCB cards...that means no good CC to use for JPN already?,btohqsg

Best cc for insurance premiums with grab nerf?,btohqsg
Actually the basic 2.5% is given by NTUC instead of Trust. I used OCBC 365 and I will receive cash back 3% plus the NTUC 2.5%,btohqsg
So I have stop using Trust and now use OCBC 365,btohqsg
If u are talking abt what is shown  it will show 2% and 2.5%My wife is union and I’m not  it shows 2 different rates,btohqsg
The fairprice app will show 0.5% and then union membership 2%,btohqsg
So in the trust app it should show 2.5% for union members?,btohqsg
It show 2% for union member,btohqsg
the basic 0.5% will show separately,btohqsg
The above is interest on savings  I thought u talk about trust cr card,btohqsg
Yup referring to trust bank savings account,btohqsg
This is what I’m getting as a non-union  if I spend 5x I’ll get 2.0% the numbers will change,btohqsg
How about union members additional 0.5%? It doesnt show?,btohqsg
Oh. So if union member it does show up here as 2.5%,btohqsg
Yea  if that is your concern,btohqsg
Weird. I’m union member but it is not reflected,btohqsg
u need to ask the bank staff to link your ntuc member,btohqsg
It seems not automatically reflected as previously I need to ask them to link it and it takes 2 weeks,btohqsg

Hi all  I was checking my previous SC Smart CC statements and I realised that my mobile order transactions at McDonald's did not get the bonus 360 rewards points.. Only those contactless transactions at the kiosk got the bonus points. Anyone encountered this too?,btohqsg
Is it. I did not really check. Will check when free time,btohqsg
What can the sc smart card points do?I tried navigating the mobile app and seems that it can only be used to convert to some travel partners.,btohqsg
Does it mean can get free flights or hotel stays etc?,btohqsg
How do you check how many points you get for each transaction? I can only find my total points balance perbl statement,btohqsg
Hi guys I just saw that HSBC revolution has 4mpd for transportation? Does this mean you can use it as a ezlink? Or use it to top up simply go?,btohqsg
i saw in some reviews  i think ezlink is excluded.,btohqsg
U want simply go pick other cc like scb smart,btohqsg
Eh does this mean the transportation in the terms just mean grab  etc? Direct tapping to use on rides also doesn't count eh?,btohqsg

OCBC Frank Card has a 6% Cashback if pay for insurance via ipaymy. However  this cashback is cap at a max of & 25?,btohqsg
Had to check manually  but it was not difficult because almost all my spend is on whitelist merchants. Then I realised that my bonus points only tallied correctly when I didn't count the mobile order and pay transactions through the McDonald's app. Base points awarded in the same statement and bonus points awarded in the following month's statement.,btohqsg
Mobile order payment is listed in the statement in non caps  kiosk contactless payment listed in caps,btohqsg
I should check that as I only use it for whitelist merchants too. Gotta wait for next statement as I only just got it. Thanks for the info!,btohqsg

If you were to book an online flight tickets cost S$3k  would you use DBS WWMC or DBS Altitude?,btohqsg
But the issue is that many insurance companies and axs do not accept amex as payment option. Therefore this option is pretty much not helpful. Would like to have suggestions if there are ways to make use of uob abs for insurance / tax,btohqsg
If you can split your air ticket purchases  best is spend up to 2k on wwmc and 1k on altitude,btohqsg
Otherwise go with 3k on altitude,btohqsg

Hi  klook or palego  use UOB PPV got 10x points?,btohqsg
Something to note about paying insurance/rent with Maybank Platinum Visa is that the amount of cashback they credit quarterly is either $30 or $100. So if you have a payment that costs $800  you'll get $75 cashback per quarter on OCBC FRANK compared to $30 on Maybank Platinum Visa,btohqsg
Frank doesn’t seems to include Insurance in the cashback.,btohqsg
Heard a dp say frank give cashback on insurance payment on ipaymy,btohqsg
will need confirmation on this so take what I saw with a grain of salt for now,btohqsg
Thank you. Cant split my bills hence need to go for dbs altitude.,btohqsg

Sorry Guys  may i ask what exactly is Trust Bank benefit feature other than current higher interest rate discount etc for now?Example how is it different and better than existing Digital Paynow Ibanking other than the current coupon  discount  rate  interest miles etc.. What is the main reason for Digital Banking to exist?Thank you,btohqsg
i can only think of one which is for future use of International Money Transfer  Instantly across currency and country Works like Pay-now but international.This is exactly the same as Bitcoin Cryptocurrency XRP etc.. But backed  up by Trusted Institution like banks or NTUC etc… Meaning centralised control.,btohqsg
May I know what ipaymy instead of Cardup? What is the advantage?,btohqsg
There is an app for it search spendee,btohqsg
other than fees difference  is there other differences between using cardup and ipaymy?,btohqsg
I notice that diff branches charge the mobile order differently. Some branches on the app I can got 2% on Spree  some only 1%. I had been feedbacking to SC but everytime they just template reply that it's what the merchant posted.,btohqsg
Since we are on the topic of expense trackers  maybe@ChrisHMSGcan set up a poll to see what is the most popular ones we are using here.,btohqsg
Lowering the barrier and banking the unbanked peopleDigital bank do not have a fall-below feewhile tradtional bank doReduce operation cost and staffingHence able to pass down those save cost on consumersLike as you said it allow the bank to scale dramatically in international level without the need of staffing local physical branch.We could see that with GXS easily enter the regional market without the need of physical locations and just needed the digital banking license. Offering better rates and interest.UOB TMRW which is their digital bank in Thailand have already been working well,btohqsg
UPDATEI just called in CIMB. They told me that the FD account activation has expired. However  they guide me on the spot to create another FD account that was activated instantly.,btohqsg
CIMB is like this based on my experience. They'll try to get you to put money in  and then try to come up with an excuse to delay the FD start date,btohqsg
that time i called them they told me will backdate to the date we transfer in the funds..,btohqsg
I see. The waiting time is really bad,btohqsg
My FD was backdated a month too,btohqsg
At least they gave me a higher interest rate and shorter maturity period compared to the ones that I applied inititally,btohqsg
I saw from another YT that using OCBC Frank via ipaymy gives good cashback hence wanna verify,btohqsg
To me  Frank is only good for iPayMy (either insurance or mortgage)  gives you effective 3.125% cashback (excl 1.79% iPayMy fee).The cashback rate can be increased if you do small forex spends. All other spend categories are just marketing gimmicks.,btohqsg
The best cashback card for iPayMy is BOC Family ... gets you 3% up to $833.33 (Satisfies most mortgages) ... and gives a whopping 10% for dining ... probably highest of all cards.,btohqsg
Amex tcb with gpmc still works or nerf?,btohqsg

Need wait 3 working days after opening the trading account before you can trade,btohqsg
By the way  for Citi reward master card  if tag to amaze and use it for dining  got 4mpd?,btohqsg
So once it is tag to amaze  all categories are able to get 4mpd except travel using amaze card rite,btohqsg
Yeah correct  so it become a general spending card with amaze,btohqsg
What card u all use to spend on travel?,btohqsg
Is HSBC revolution good to add on as a backup in case u spend over 1k? Or is it better to get HSBC to be the primary card,btohqsg
I put all my hotel booking and air ticket on DBS altitude but use amaze + CRMC for travel expenses like dinning   buying stuffs overseaHSBC is a good backup card cause if paired with EGA bonus extra 1% cashback but HSBC don’t reward for telecom but it still a good card to have cause zero annual fees  HSBC is my flowover card after the $1000 spending,btohqsg
And also we dk when Citi + amaze combo may end ? So it still a good card to keep around,btohqsg
Wouldn't HSBC be a better primary since it gives 4mpd +1% from EGA,btohqsg
How does the HSBC revolution work? Does it tag with amaze? I am considering. How does it work with EGA?,btohqsg
No. Amaze only work with MC.,btohqsg
True but it easier to use with Citi + amaze   my plan would be once Citi + amaze end  Citi will be mainly all my online purchase and HSBC for general,btohqsg
HSBC EGA have a monthly required transactions and deposit5 eligible transactions and deposit $2k,btohqsg
Citi + amaze you can just use on anything other then travel + excluded general mcc like insurance   utilities etc,btohqsg
2k is monthly deposit or balance to keep inside?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone face this issue with amaze?,btohqsg
You check your card security allowance,btohqsg
Under Amaze or the card that link to amaze?,btohqsg
Under amaze   your linked card see all as local transaction,btohqsg
So every mth need deposit $2k?,btohqsg
Is there a min spend for DBS altitude and what is the cap for the 4MPD,btohqsg
Yeah if you want that 1% plus you need 5 eligible transaction,btohqsg
So what is the biggest difference between Citi reward and HSBC revolution? It seem alot of ppl getting Citi reward,btohqsg
DBS altitude earn 3mpd on airline ticket and hotel but if book via Expedia you earn 6mpdCapped at $5k per month,btohqsg
You can put all and any online transaction like pay telecom bill   Netflix subscription etc but you can’t with HSBCPlus like currently with linking to amaze  you can spend the card like local and earn you rewards with somewhat okay rate + zero FCY fee +1% cashback,btohqsg
HSBC don’t have the extra benefit of using it oversea cause you will incurred FCY fees with shit rate from bank,btohqsg
So you like go JB spend money  your HSBC card will not be used anymore unless you baller don’t care shit rate or FCY fees 🤣,btohqsg
Utilities and telco ok? To get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Only digital subscription and telecom for Citi reward  HSBC don’t allow you to earn,btohqsg
Or charge to Citi reward directly,btohqsg
Just charge directly no point go 1 round since it already online 🤣,btohqsg
Will i qualify for 3MPD if booking hotels via Agoda booking.com trip.cometc? Or does it only apply if I book through the official hotel website,btohqsg
Plus once awhile DBS run promo with Agoda like 10-18% discount and it stackable + earn 3mpd,btohqsg
Do I earn 4mpd for fairprice app purchase (ordering food/groceries )for DBS WWMC ?,btohqsg
Thanks so much for the help@Edwin,btohqsg
EGA also got $2k min ADB otherwise $5 FBF,btohqsg

cannot must manually do it monthly,btohqsg
premier ega account no fall below fee,btohqsg
does it work ? havent tried it,btohqsg
woah nice  maybe i should try set it up too,btohqsg
Is it? I saw premier also $5 in this pdf…,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is a multicurrency account so if you have their debit card you can enjoy their exchange rates + 1% cashback,btohqsg
Does it work with premier ega for the hsbc revolution,btohqsg
Does anyone face any issue transferring money out of hsbc ega?,btohqsg
must maintain the monthly 2K deposit or can just deposit then withdraw to enjoy the additional 1%,btohqsg
How do I check my UOB one credit card cycle?,btohqsg
You can check via chat assist,btohqsg
I believe these are two separate things. Maintaining 2k balance is related to fall below fee. Deposit 2k related to 1% cash back and 1% additional interest rate.,btohqsg
i just read their tnc  need aggregate deposit of 2K per month  does aggregate here mean that net balance after the month needs to be increased by 2K,btohqsg
nope. they never mention incremental 2k per month... 2 things  1st min ADB 2k or $5 FBF. 2nd monthly deposit 2k  they mention that the qualified transactions even include fund transfer  so u can transfer out the remaining part of monthly 2k after any usage.,btohqsg
Wa swee ah! okay then it make sense to do it. thanks for the clarification. just need to maintain the 2K ADB,btohqsg
Hmm for the 2k ADB  if I just opened the account last week and deposited 2k  does it mean I fail to meet the ADB requirement cos the counter starts from day 1?,btohqsg
ADB just in theory lah... not sure they really that strict for every month or not,btohqsg
first month of course fall below 2k,btohqsg
any one time benefits for existing hsbc credit card owner ah to apply for the account.,btohqsg
yes I have targeted email promotion. I signed up their CC in Dec,btohqsg
$180 cash back: same as SingSaver requirements but just 2 investment txns needed,btohqsg
I understand amaze card gives 1% instapoints on fx spend  but I’ve also seen some folks say any spend on amaze is converted to sgd. so curious about the actual mechanism. If I go korea and spend using amaze for a transaction in KRW  do I get the 1% instapoints?,btohqsg
maintain 2k ADB still worth seems like. cost $3.67 (take OCBC 3.25% and EGA 1.05% as benchmark) less than FBF $5 😅,btohqsg
Hello guys questionsYoutrip link to grabIn JB the grab payment are in RM?Thank you,btohqsg
So it logs as krw and that earns the 1% instapoints  but on my statement it would be converted to SGD alr?,btohqsg
Hello all  can I ask if I use my HSBC revolution card on ESSO petrol kiosk  and I use Apple Pay. Am I eligible for the 10 x points :),btohqsg
Basically when ever you charge amaze card in non-sgd you earn 1% then amaze will then your linked card in sgd always,btohqsg
no  petrol mcc not in whitelist for 10x points,btohqsg
Hi sorry just want to confirm for hsbc EGA  so maintain above 2k ADB  but your 2k monthly balance can just transfer in and out? To get the 1% cashback,btohqsg
So you can transfer from the first day of the month  then straight away take out,btohqsg
Utilities eg. Senoko got no 4mpd for amaze+citi,btohqsg
Thank you! So best to use Citibank (add Amaze) one which is eligible for the 10X points? Based on the video released today :),btohqsg
u sure? utilities mcc is excluded,btohqsg
depends  there are other cards that give upfront discount for petrol,btohqsg
It seems that after grabpay nerf for axs  best way now to pay for income tax is HSBC EGA 1%? Through giro deduction. Is there a better way than this?,btohqsg
Huge spending on petrol hence wanna find out which card will be the best,btohqsg
google about it  there are blogs about this.,btohqsg
Yea got no 4mpd  typo ps,btohqsg
bruh your 180 cashback  accounted for the 2 buy trade fees for the equity investment account?,btohqsg
Any website that has the latest consolidated discounted miles fare deals for all the airlines ah?,btohqsg
Anyone know how to redeem Citibank cash back card? I have a few hundred dollars inside however every single time I tried to SMS to redeem  it doesn’t work lol,btohqsg
If I understand correctly  although FD% is the same at 4.15  CIMB 18-month FD earns more dollars interest than 12-month due to longer tenure?,btohqsg
I haven't applied yet. need to open by 28 Feb and complete all by 30 Apr only. Cannot open online. need to go down to branch...,btohqsg
If u referring to cashback card (not cashback+ card)  no need to redeem. Cashback will be auto credit in multiples of $10 once accummulate min $50 cashback.,btohqsg

Wanna show you I can’t redeem at all lol,btohqsg
Same loh... just found AXS can pay IRAS with CC then happlily skipped my GIRO installment and paid a few thousand with Citi cash back+ and got no cash back at all. Never read TnC 😭,btohqsg
I am using GIRO for my tax too….🙃 so it means AXS then use CC pay can get certain cashback / miles?,btohqsg
Is the UOB EVOL Card a good cashback card?,btohqsg
can pay but no rewards due to CC exclusion,btohqsg
GIRO is good for now due to high interest. +1% cashback from EGA better,btohqsg
maybe due to roaming? that SMS number could be local only,btohqsg
In the past hearsay no such exclusion,btohqsg
Car installment can use to earn miles? Hearsay CARDUP can buy overall you paying for the miles,btohqsg
How should I approach this? Use cpf or cash for hdb downpayment and mortgage? I'm buying a hdb  bto in 6 years key collection  if use cpf first can repay the amounts used and accused interest?,btohqsg
Use the money that is yielding the lowest return. In current high interest environment  use OA first. Grow your cash in fixed deposit/t bills. When interest rates drop below 2.5%  then refund to your OA.,btohqsg
The only card was Amex high flyer + GPMC but it lockout now,btohqsg
If really want earn miles with FCY then use amaze + CRMC,btohqsg
i got a shopee transaction which is still not posted in my UOBOne card since 20th Jan. End up I unable to hit the $500 min spend. The whole quarter cash rebate gone. 🥲,btohqsg
Is it possible to refund OA specifically with cash?,btohqsg
Those with min spend must do homework be alertCan't slack,btohqsg
Ic will have a look thanks,btohqsg
To receive singsaver offers  we also need to make 1 investment trade?,btohqsg

Hi guys. If I activate my newly received credit card on 30 Jan. Does it mean my statement month will be on 30th every month?,btohqsg
Uob said it's shopee side that delay the posting. Nothing wrong on their end,btohqsg
Hi gurus  any card strategy for procedures like lasik?,btohqsg
Nope usually the banks have their own statement dates,btohqsg
Yes i know but u can try appeal for the quarter cashback,btohqsg
More details needed for us to suggest suitable cards  e.g. where do you do the lasik (hospital  optician  etc)  how much does it cost  how do you pay (online or contactless)  is it one shot payment or by installments?,btohqsg
Hi all  which card is good for hotel wedding banquet payment? dbs woman's card if hotel can allow us to pay 2k monthly? TIA,btohqsg
dbs woman's 4mpd only if online. Uob visa signature 4mpd for contactless  $2k monthly. Uob ppv 4mpd for mobile contactless  $1k monthly. HSBC Revolution 4mpd for contactless/online  $1k monthly,btohqsg
Under HSBC rewards programme  if I use the debit card linked to EGA to pay for public transport  would I get the 1% cashback?,btohqsg
If I’m not wrong debit card spend doesn’t have a whitelist right,btohqsg
So you mean doesn't matter which day I activate my credit card. The statement date is sort of fixed by bank already?,btohqsg
Yes. Refer to the exclusions for the 1% rebate,btohqsg
Any CC can use on utilities like Starhub/SP ?Does hsbc earn 10x reward for starhub ?,btohqsg
How long does gxs account to be approved,btohqsg
Starhub is Telco MCC. No 10x rewards points on hsbc revolution as Telco MCC is not in the whitelist of MCC for 10x rewards points. Can get 10x points on dbs wwmc or citi rewards if paid monthly online via starhub app/website.SP is utilities MCC. No 10x points on any card. Can use rebate cards like uob one card; or posb everyday/ocbc 365 for recurring bill payment.,btohqsg
Yes can  I used Cardup and gotten miles.,btohqsg
ICBC where got 4.2 so high,btohqsg

Hi all! I think this qn was not previously answered  so can anyone help me out?I intend to put $500 into OCBC360 account on the 1st day of every month  to hit the save criteria. Will this be okay? I saw that someone commented that if the 1st falls on a weekend or public holiday  then it wouldn't be counted or something. Can someone help confirm if that is true? Thanks!,btohqsg
u can monitor the daily balance via OCBC Ibanking via the details of your account,btohqsg
i will just use another card,btohqsg
The $500 will only be counted on next business day,btohqsg

Hi Chris  regrading the EGA promo  u mentioned can buy sgx stock at around $11  is this equity account or unit trust account? Sorry I have no investment knowledge hah,btohqsg
Ok thanks 🙏 Opened EGA but in the app only got unit trust option. Seems like I need to go branch,btohqsg
One more question  for the UOB ONE account saving bonus of $500 spent  this is by the calendar month ya? Meaning from 1st to the last of the month  need to spend $500. Am I correct? Thanks.,btohqsg
one year T bill auctioned at 3.87%,btohqsg
Every calendar month must spend $500  otherwise interest rate for that month goes straight away to 0.05% despite any other conditions eg salary credit/3 giro,btohqsg
I think DBS WWMC and CRMC should work since these would be online transactions,btohqsg
Mine 20 dec not out yet,btohqsg
Anyone opened citiplus account and have experience with the account closure? Need to walk into citibank branch to close or can do it online via app? I recall we need to hold the amt (at least 15k) for 4mths and can close the acc to get the perks right?,btohqsg

Just curious  for miles chaser  is it reasonable to own about 5 to 6 miles cards for different purposes?Daily expenses except Travel  I use citibank rewards linked with amaze up to $1000 for 4mpdFor next $1001 to $2000  I use HSBC revolution for dining  transport  groceries  online purchases (via contactless or online) for 4mpdFor big ticket for travel   I use DBS woman world master up to $2000 for 4mpdFor overseas big ticket  I am thinking to sign up OCBC 90n for 2.1 mpd since such purchases are less frequent  so points with no expiry stands out for me.For local big ticket item  I am thinking to sign up OCBC Titanum awards for 4mpd for online and offine but downside is points valid for 2 years (24 months) only.,btohqsg
We have to balance between the number of redemptions we have and the Type of spending we spend on. You’ve got a pretty good to do list for spending.,btohqsg
For 90% populations  3 cards can get to 95% optimal miles game in Singapore. But then you factor in sign-up bonuses from here and there  there are reasons to own more card for churning  basic ROI evaluations. It's all coming down to ROI  ability to keep track and do frequent ROI calculation.,btohqsg
applied for it thru myinfo via their website yesterday... approved immediately,btohqsg
I did that. Not sure y taking so long. I called HSBC and they said they are reviewing.,btohqsg
Assuming used up Amaze+crmc  can consider Amaze+uob prvi mc for overseas big ticket. 0.7 less mpd but save on 3% fx fee.ocbc titanium only covers a limited list MCC,btohqsg

Hi. Can I link my Maybank fnf card to amaze so I get the offline retail spend to online and get the 8% cash back,btohqsg
I think is totally reasonable as long as you can budget your spending well and always do your calculations and maintaining expiry of points and all i myself have citi miles  citi reward  hsbc revo  uob ppv  dbs woman  and both ocbc tri card.the main idea is that  as long as you know what ur doing tho for me i would not suggest doing ocbc 90n for foreign spend due to the bad rates and 3.25 fcy.So i will still tag amaze with my citi miles As for ocbc titanum  if u have a big expenses or u always shop taobao shopee lazada and other etc which u can read the list  it's really good  just a reminder to be in Blocks of 5 And always remember is to maximize the specialise card that is v hard to hit first   then use the easy card like amaze tag with citi reward.,btohqsg
not to forget i also have krisflyer acend card   but i only use to for welcome bonus. and dbs attitude for the lounge visit or if my travel hits limit on my other 4mpd cards.,btohqsg
Is it worth it to take the foreign currency fee to use the cards overseas for 4mpd or to use revolut/youtrip to save on the fees? (extra outside of amaze crmc),btohqsg
Paying CC visa for 4mpd is about 0.81 cpm. But if u use amaze card u be paying about 0.3cpm assuming 1.2% spread. Weigh it accordingly I guess.,btohqsg
Promo overValid from 15 July 2020 to 31 December 2020,btohqsg
Yea I meant after amaze cap is reached. Technically since it's less than 1.5c  it's worth it right? It seems like it makes sense but seems most ppl are against doing it. Vs using cash from money changer (x spread?) or revolut  I'm just wondering what are everyone's thoughts on that.,btohqsg

how do you derive that amount tho,btohqsg

Let's say $100 with fcy does it mean I'm spending $103.25? So $3.25 spent on 400 miles  doesn't that translate to 0.8 cents paid for a mile? Am I calculating it wrongly? If each mile is worth 1.5 cents to me  it's pretty worth it no?,btohqsg
What's the best Cashback credit card to use for online shopping eg. Shopee taobao,btohqsg
I think people already mention KrisFlyer ascend card. I use it for education (e.g. udemy  CFA) and private hospital (specialist clinic) expenses and other commonly excluded expenses. You can consider if you have such needs,btohqsg
Hi! For the citi cash back card  do i need to spend $800 every month to enjoy the 8% cashback or spending $800 every alternate month will also qualify for the 8% cashback? TIA!,btohqsg
Is anybody using SC cards or banking app?I log into my account wanting to view my card transactionsThere’s no card details or anything on the app.Anybody facing this issues too?,btohqsg
Which credit card to accumulate miles is good for simplygo and online spend/contactless,btohqsg
You must view it in your bank CPFIS account the money is no longer in CPF OA account,btohqsg
Please check whether you temporarily lock your card.. If you do  you need to unlock it first,btohqsg
LOL it works!This is the first time I’m seeing such a featureI almost thought there’s a problem with my account,btohqsg
Yeah.. Other banks don't hide the account when you temporarily lock the card. Only SC does.,btohqsg
I think you will get 8% as long as you hit 800 for the particular month. Don't have to be Every Month,btohqsg
does amaze + crmc get 4mpd for dining grocery simplygo?,btohqsg
Regarding  SC smart cc. I use it only for bus/mrt and McDonald's (paying in-store via paywave)  but how come my calculation of reward points based on posted transactions differs from the one that I have? Or does it take some time for the reward points to be adjusted?,btohqsg
The bulk of the points will be added the following month after accumulated (1.6 pts per SGD for that month  17.6 for the following months)Chris kindly broke this down in his latest video on cashback credit card 2023 at arnd 2mins:10secs,btohqsg

Has anyone applied for ocbc360 account recently and not getting new updates from them? I thought the approval would be instant for savings,btohqsg
Yes  to mile chasers I think generally worth it. And people that knows how to utilise miles effective. E.g booking economy to TPE vs business to JFKI think most have issues with paying for miles when they can get 4mpd without paying additional fees for spending in Singapore. So why pay 0.8 cents per mile when you are overseas?Illuratrated the following with my mom in Dec last year during a trip when she asked why I'm using credit card instead of Youtrip.If we are paying 0.8 cents per mile  and to redeem round trip to NRT on business we need around 104000 miles. It means we are paying $832 for a round trip business (not including taxes). At current economy flight rates  it's almost $1100.So i asked my mom would she pay $832 for a business class round trip ticket to Tokyo or $1100 for economy.,btohqsg
I think ur forgetting the bad fx spread.,btohqsg
Not sure whether I'm doing this right.Using Mastercard Currency Converter + 3.25% FCY vs Google rates for USD100 spend.Mastercard: SGD135.80Google: SGD131.20Difference (cost) is $4.6Even if i use cost of $5  a SIN-NRT Business class ticket will cost $1300. I think still okay,btohqsg
I think like what you mention above. If ur a mile chaser that could really execute everything well  it is worth.But the only problem is  with miles. You also have to be worry about the expiry date. And another concern is about the devaluation that has happened during 2022 which will always happen due to inflation,btohqsg
haha thats not the only problem. For hot places.. whether u can get saver ticket also another issue.,btohqsg
So if you could pay zero fees or lesser fees is always better  or should I say I value per mile lesser haha,btohqsg
Well indeed and it happened to me. So if I’m not getting advantage. I would have to find a time that I can be flexible and fit in .,btohqsg
Yes. Do it only if it's worth it for you! Everyone wants and needs different. So thats why people keep asking whether is it worth it  it really depends.,btohqsg
It is worth it   the miles game also act as instalment for the next flight ticket I often asked myself if 4 tickets of total 5k which card should I use ? Therefore miles game has it purpose.,btohqsg
Question: for people who bought a flat using cpf does the VC 3 account helps to “repay” the accrued interest portion?,btohqsg
Does paynow salary works for ocbc 360 salary interest?,btohqsg
I think this example is exactly what I'm thinking. I was just wondering if I'm counting it correctly. If I need to buy a ticket to Japan  buying it via miles at 0.8c is much cheaper than buying it in cash.,btohqsg
What is VC 3? I paid using CPF and never heard of such account b4,btohqsg
I've never done that so no clue  doesnt it go inside OA?,btohqsg
Actually can reduce miles cost if u use HSBC EGA 😂,btohqsg
no lah u dun use cpm this way. Think about it  if local spend or using Amaze+CRMC you can get 4MPD at no fees  does it mean cpm is 0?If really want to use cpm  should use (3.25+difference in fx exchange rate )/(400miles-miles earned for $100 fx spend without need to pay 3.25%),btohqsg
Hi all Would like to check that if there are any ongoing sign up bonus for existing card holder for citi? Wanted to sign up for citi rewards master card. But it seems like all promotions are only for new members.Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
If you benchmark the same $1k spending will get you 4000 miles or $25 cashback on hsbc revo  that translates to opportunity cost of 0.625 cpm - edited to account 2.5% cashback for revo,btohqsg
For additional 1% for HSBC Revolution card  does this mean I have to fulfill EGA 2k monthly topup or just opening the account will do?,btohqsg
need to fulfil $2k/$5k topup (can withdraw immediately) and 5 transactions (can just fast $1 from ega to other bank 5 times) before getting additional 1% rebate.,btohqsg
Nice. Thanks both for the clarification 👍,btohqsg
why not use Amaze+crmc then? Get 4mpd  no fx fee  about 1% higher exchange rate compared to mastercard/visa which can be offset with instapoints earned.Also updated my earlier post on how I would calculate cpm for this case,btohqsg
Yes for dinning and grocery but not for SimplyGo,btohqsg
I think he meant if you use locally miles instead of cash back  you’re also losing 0.85cpm. So using it overseas with the fees still comes up to be the same. But of course with amaze crmc would be priority for first use and left over to eat the fcy.,btohqsg
Does each credit card use counts for transactions too or just 1 time.,btohqsg
each transaction on hsbc card count to 1 transaction  but no 1% yet before fulfilling 5 transactions. Easiest is still do 5×$1 FAST to other bank first to get the everyday+ rewards started. Subsequently months no need to worry about the 5 transactions if you using hsbc card 5 times each month,btohqsg
Some simple maths. Your cents per mile (cpm) can be calculated by cb%/mpd. Eg 6% cashback against 4mpd gives you 6/4 or 1.5cpm.,btohqsg
even if maxed out Amaze+crmc  there are still Amaze+uob lady  Amaze+ocbc Titanium  Amaze+maybank family and friends etc.,btohqsg
Weird I can’t seem to apply for the EGA online. Says not available for me…,btohqsg
Wah I don’t have so many cards to cycle…,btohqsg

So can be used for any recurring payment? (e.g. Senoko  some cards don't give for utilities),btohqsg
mcc exclusion still applies. Amaze dun change the MCC  online is separate indicator from MCC,btohqsg
Amaze converts to online so pretty much everything is eligible for max rewards  excluding travel (and the standard insurance  utilities etc.),btohqsg
