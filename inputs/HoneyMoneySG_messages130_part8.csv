Idk if it helps but my company uses minmed group for health screening and it accepts Amex via the app lol. Can consider if your office does not limit health screening providers to Fullerton Health,btohqsg
hi  i‚Äôve just transferred some money to my hsbc ega account but the date states 9 sep. does it mean the money will officially be credited tomorrow?i‚Äôm actually crediting the amount for GIRO payment that is due today. any idea?,btohqsg
It will only be considered transferred tomorrow but it will be available to use already. Most BO will bring forward to push backwards GIRO deduction to the nearest business day if it's a weekend  though GIRO is available daily.,btohqsg

Hi  I've asked the cso to move the evol overpaid amt to my uob one acct. But cso said cannot. In the end  the cso offered to move the evol overpaid amt to another uob credit card instead. Hope this helps.,btohqsg

What card will you recommend to buy a camera around S$3000? Thanks.,btohqsg
Where are you getting the camera from?,btohqsg
Hi  is there any recommendation to pay quarterly mcst? like which cc or cc stalking? thanks!,btohqsg
if they accept split payment  get UOB VS for 2k and UOB PPV for 1k. Else  you choose those cards with sign up bonus for 3k spend.,btohqsg
Thanks. Done that but some feedback said can and some say cannot so not conclusive. I will monitor it this month. üôè,btohqsg
Is there a credit card offering unlimited cash back that is Visa? So far all I came across was Mastercards.Doesn‚Äôt matter if it is between 1.5% to 1.7% cash back.,btohqsg
Lol! Nice one. Other than DBS Vantage?I‚Äôm sort of stuck with a lot of DBS points which I‚Äôm keeping for miles conversion so I don‚Äôt want to touch that card.,btohqsg
Maybank and CIMB do offer such cards  for Visa.,btohqsg
Their uncapped cards are MC though,btohqsg
"I'm pretty sure if their t&c states ""Unlimited"" it's uncapped.",btohqsg
I found Maybank FC Barcelona Visa Signature Card 1.6% üòä,btohqsg
Here is the reason why I‚Äôm asking. I use CardUp a lot so I balance cash back and miles so I really pay ‚Äúgood‚Äù rates for miles after I factor in some gains from cash back.CardUp promo mainly works on Visa cards so I‚Äôm trying to get a cash back + EGA to see if I can offset some of the fees I‚Äôm paying for miles.Previously got Citi PayAll promos so I can use Citi Cash back+ for some offset with EGA.,btohqsg
Thank you! Did you call them directly  visit them or use UOB chat assist?,btohqsg
Anyone has any experience with standard chartered simply cash credit card?,btohqsg
Using it to pay hospital bills to get the 1.5% cashback is it the same as amex trucashback no other conditions?,btohqsg
Scb exclude hospital bills in sep liao i think,btohqsg
lol. Can prepare to ban Liao,btohqsg
Actually one person can have how many credit cards?,btohqsg
There should not be a limit,btohqsg
Long term probably no limit as said by other person. But unlikely you will get approved for all in a short span of time as applications lower your credit rating.,btohqsg
Hi. May i ask if uob absolute amex card still works for tax payment like income tax  property tax  road tax etc? Thank you,btohqsg
OK noted. For now my credit score still AA,btohqsg
Hi all  may I ask the following  I have a UOB Evol card.I made a $300 spending on hospital bill and $500 dollars spending on retail via contactless payment.Does this mean I have hit the $800 minimum spending? If yes  i am assuming that I get 10% Cashback for only the $500 retail spend (capped at $30)?,btohqsg
Is DBS Vantage Card worth it for Cardup Rent Payment at 1.78% admin fee with 1.5% Cashback or 1.5 mpd?Very new here to the country and Cardup game and looking for a recommendation for a best CC for Cardup (cashback or miles)Spend is around 11K - rent  education  helper salary etc,btohqsg
11k per month? How much do you value a mile?,btohqsg
Has anyone purchased PIMCO fund before? Is it a good fund to buy to earn dividends?,btohqsg
How much do you guys have in Chocolate?,btohqsg
Is getting charged in USD for MCC5399 General Merchandise Store online purchases in Singapore qualify as ‚Äúoverseas spend‚Äù? üòÖ,btohqsg
Haha from bank.. so wondering if it good fund to buy,btohqsg
Thinking of applying for DBS Altitude for a noise cancellation headphones signup offer üòÇ,btohqsg
Ya various banks have been pushing it hahaha. I‚Äôll let others comment.,btohqsg
For dbs  from what i know  charging in fcy is considered foreign currency. But why? For 5mpd promo?,btohqsg
So what do they tell you the good things? Consistent returns  capital protected?,btohqsg
Wanting to buy some camera gear that only charges in USD. Could use UOB PPV that I have for mcc5399 but I have been wanting a ANC earphone so this singsaver promo seems quite attractive with $500 min spend. Just wanting to maximize the rewards to justify not getting 4mpd on PPV instead. Overseas spend is 2.2mpd on altitude & 5399 doesn‚Äôt seem to get anything on the other cards on promotionhttps://www.singsaver.com.sg/campaign/dbs-credit-card-livefresh-altitude-posbeveryday,btohqsg
For paying incoming tax and loan and stuff  Cardup or IpayMy is better?,btohqsg
Lol he mentioned stable dividend of 6% which can get every month kind.. then I got spare cash so not sure if I should go for this fund... Sound like this fund is not a good choice? üò≥,btohqsg
Did he tell u admin fee? Fund maintenance fee? Etc,btohqsg
I think is 3% by the bank,btohqsg
And there is yearly management fee. I got told 1.45% pa. üòÖ,btohqsg
You do a simple maths. How much already makan by the bank?,btohqsg
Dividends from investments are never consistent depending on economic conditions. Also  capital are not protected. What happens in bad times? If the fund went down in value  I don‚Äôt think they can do anything. Are you prepared to take this volatility?,btohqsg
