Just take care of the car and the car will take care of you,btohqsg
old cars all sure have problems,btohqsg
That's when the B9 came in,btohqsg
But most 2016 b9s will be at the point of requiring wear and tear work,btohqsg
Mazda 6 can be problematic also if it was in the hands of a wrong owner,btohqsg
So be prepared for that if you look at units with no maint history,btohqsg
Got people drive 6 years never change ATF,btohqsg
If toyota engine oil also can,btohqsg
But usually the seller will always require deposit before inspection right? So far I asked a few seller's they told me the same thing.,btohqsg
Can run long long no issues,btohqsg
But with bmw your benefit is that for maint history,btohqsg
But the deposit will offset from your downpayment,btohqsg
You can check in the idrive itself,btohqsg
And exactly what has been done on every service,btohqsg
If done at a specialist with the right computer or at PML,btohqsg
Maybe you should get a bmw one day,btohqsg
Seems like you have the passion for it,btohqsg
So it'll help you judge the condition better if you aren't too sure about how to check physically and during test drive,btohqsg
And then place deposit and go in for a good PPI,btohqsg
This ‚ÄòSea‚Äô typing a whole @ss essay,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what he has been saying all the time,btohqsg
spent 5 minutes typing 1 line of nonsense,btohqsg
and use his alt account to circlejerk,btohqsg
Most of the time  ppi isn‚Äôt a waste of time and money,btohqsg
i got a police officer reporting to me - J,btohqsg
very reliable this police officer - J,btohqsg
I everytime call J no show one,btohqsg
You need to feed him begedils bro,btohqsg
eh relax  we will post the COE results here later1 - J,btohqsg
But I think will drop leh,btohqsg
After news shud be cooling the market,btohqsg
All the siaolang bid $1 shiok,btohqsg
Cat A and Cat D still $1 ooo,btohqsg
i almost want to dash to ATM  u know all pian lang,btohqsg
Mazda gotta make sure the capacitor is in good condition! Annoying to get that changed out as it‚Äôs a common problem that shows up after 6 years or so,btohqsg
But like the others say  as long as you have preventive maintenance  it‚Äôs ok la. Just that parts for BMW may be more expensive generally,btohqsg
Ic ok. I'll look it up  but this capacitor is taking care of the ieLoop?,btohqsg

So far I only had issues with my folding side mirrors as my 6 doesn‚Äôt have the i eloop feature,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt remember exactly  I think parts and labour should be around 1.8k?,btohqsg
Yeah  at least some improvements hahaha. Hopefully it steadily drops like this over the next biddings,btohqsg
Drop by my car coe end,btohqsg
316i - 2012 to 2015. N13 4 cyc318i - 2015 to 2017 b38 3 cyc,btohqsg
N13 is more powerful than b38,btohqsg
But 2015 to 17 316i very underpowered,btohqsg
sometimes really need the ecu to unlock its potential,btohqsg
thats why i say aim for 1 before warranty end,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the drama in the afternoon,btohqsg
