Hi guys is citipayall points seperate from cc miles awards? Say If I use citipay all with CR  my insurance premium is $2k  will I still be capped at the 1k CR limit?https://milelion.com/2023/10/18/citi-payall-offering-1-8-mpd-on-all-payments-buy-miles-at-1-2-cents-each/,btohqsg
I added my card into taobao app. There is charges? Will taobao revert the charges?,btohqsg
It's normal when adding card to OTP verify that you own the card. Will be charged back.,btohqsg
If I take competitive route  will I need to pay anything if I didn't get the yield I asked for? Can anyone help explain,btohqsg
When you put in competitive bid  you are basically saying anything below the interest rates you do not want. I personally recommend putting competitive in case any glitch that the interest rates dropped too much. Downside - you are the last to be alloted if there is a lot of applications,btohqsg
Cash no. Cpf yes. Cpf yes because of bank as the platform,btohqsg
I will be using srs from posb,btohqsg
I saw an option on posb app there was a srs option to buy t-bills,btohqsg
Remember to top up CPF and SRS,btohqsg
Hi all  does topping up CPF for tax relief make sense if my risk tolerance is still high? I.e. DCA into index/equities,btohqsg
Yes  cpf gives u a fall back plan in case your investments turn out bad,btohqsg
Is it because it‚Äôs guaranteed? What if I‚Äôm still very young with high risk tolerance - DCA into diversified portfolio w bonds thru robo advisors? My time horizon is retirement. Or would the tax savings from CPF top-up make a lot of difference LT?,btohqsg
Actually the tax savings wont make alot of difference at the start,btohqsg
Think eventual goal is to reach frs  by when is up to u,btohqsg

I plan to DCA S$500 every month for VOO  QQQ and IWDA/VWRA  which platforms offer better fee and exchange rate? I have moomoo  tiger  fsm1 and Vickers,btohqsg
Open Interactive Brokers for IWDA/VWRA. Moomoo / Tiger / FSM1 don't support LSE and Vickers rates are way too ex,btohqsg
Thanks  how about for voo and qqq?,btohqsg
Moomoo or tiger  both about the same. I don't usually buy US ETFs though because of the withholding taxes. Rather just buy the Irish domiciled equivalent,btohqsg
