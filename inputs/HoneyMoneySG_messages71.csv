Look for other promos that require $100K for tier rewards e.g. Webull  Moomoo. Assuming you have that risk appetite for MMFs,btohqsg
Means withdraw down everything on 01 Feb and place 100k into mmf somewhere and 01 March move back 100k?,btohqsg
are there any ocbc credit cards with perpetual fee waiver,btohqsg
OCBC TR card can get waiver if you spend $10k on each card a year,btohqsg
hmm that's a bit much unless the card is my main card for transport and utilities,btohqsg
OCBC TR used to be a fantastic mile cards. U can charge $12k to the card when u go shop for a bag in Europe or any big ticketed item. And earn 48k miles easily. And then keep the card in the drawer since the annual limit is $12k spendBUT from November 2023 onwards  there is a monthly spend cap. The card is greatly nerfed,btohqsg
The collective convention wisdom is Feb month I guess. So this means withdraw down everything on 01 Feb and place 100k into mmf somewhere and 01 March move back 100k?,btohqsg
Hi all  anybody used POSB usd FD before? Got any feedback?,btohqsg

Guys  are there more flights slots when you redeem return tickets compared to booking two one way tickets?,btohqsg
So on 1 Feb withdraw everything excess of 100k?,btohqsg
but if we just withdraw the excess from 100k  we just stand to lose 1.5% in Feb and still can get 3.15%pa in Feb. So if we take 100k and whack 26-27 days of 3.7% from MMF and then redeem and move back. It can be quite a bit of effort and need to time right cos redemption might take a few days depending on weekend to get funds back. so can be quite risk. so forsake the 1.5% might save the hassle.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if I linked my AMAZ CRMC with Alipay or WeChat pay  do I get 4mpd for dining and taxi spend?,btohqsg
Trazorasince I am still waiting for my citi rewards card. Using my uob lady solitaire link with amaze is the best option now for foreign spendings,btohqsg

Hi gurus If I need to top up and pay using Grabpay for $2.1k payment.Apart from UOB absolute 0.3%  any other methods that I can get more benefits?,btohqsg
N we just made payment only,btohqsg
FYI reminder to Amaze user to disable the overseas spending and/or online transaction whenever not needed (or block the entire card if not used frequently). I got 3 fraud transactions from online spending with a total of USD $700++. The scammer somehow managed to bypass the OTP (txns were approved before the OTP came).I can tell you dealing with instarem support is not fun (chat only  response is a bit slow although still somehow acceptable). And unlike bank  they dont provide temporary credit  so I need to pay the bill first (linked to citi rewards).They managed to get the chargeback from the merchant  but its only about 60% of the total bill now(seems wrong communication on either instarem/mastercard/merchant side.This is still ongoing. Hope I can recover the rest.,btohqsg
There is an option to raise dispute request in citi app  they will provide temp credit while the investigation is ongoing,btohqsg
I did raise it to citi  they said I need to block and replace the citi card. But instarem said I dont need to do that because the fraud is with instarem and not citi. They will take care of it.,btohqsg
Usually how long does it take to get the credit card promotion money?,btohqsg

If Harvey Norman use Kris+with UOB KF  3MPD uncapped. (dont think got other uncapped cards liao for such MCC),btohqsg
I applied for uob Evol few months ago and uob one visa last week. Both times my approval were within 24 hours.

Anyone know why cimb saving 3.5%¬† interests suppose to give out on 20 every month but not credit today?,btohqsg
going to apply the recommended card(s). dont really have a specific merchant in mind  but probably the likes of ikea  courts  harvey norman etc.,btohqsg
harvey u can consider what joseph have recommended. U can look at uob visa signature  uob prefer platinum if u can paywave at merchant. for courts I know that if u are not in hurry to make payment  u can always lock in the price and make spilt payment. black friday is coming too  suggest to wait and see if there is good deal. you can also look at mall voucher sales at time as usually it related to around 5 to 10 percent off if you are a cash rebate pax over miles.,btohqsg
I do realise most of u guys recommend those 4miles per $1 or 3miles per $1. what abt those miles cards like citi premiere miles,btohqsg
if can get more miles  why use a card with lower earn rate?,btohqsg
so what cards will you guys recommend for miles chasing. I only have the hsbc revo and ocbc 365 card at the moment.,btohqsg
planning for long term. so for future when have big ticket items too,btohqsg
other than uob ladies cards  UOB krisflyer card?,btohqsg
Daily driver usually is CRMC w Amaze and HSBC Revo  UOB Lady's is a good to have given its 6mpd is a promo (till Feb 2024)Big ticket items  really is see sign-up gift and form and amount of payment. If you were months earlier then OCBC TR will have been good but that's sadly nerfed away,btohqsg
But if u open to cashback for big ticket  can look at Citi SMRT  think Chris mentioned it before and its using an annual cap.,btohqsg
for uob ladies card  possible to apply for the normal card then upgrade to the solitaire card?,btohqsg
Citi bank limited cash back Vs UOB unlimited cash back which is better any thoughts?,btohqsg
Possible  but note that 120K requirement is quite strictly enforced based on other data points..,btohqsg
but these cards I can link to kris+ app and also earn the extra miles right?,btohqsg
Kris+ uses Google Pay or Apple Pay  soooo,btohqsg
but the cards used link to apple pay for kris+. some cards are recommended and some wasn't,btohqsg
applied this card few days ago but still not approved  they didnt ask for my pay in the application as an existing UOB acc user  not sure if they are using my salary info from years ago üôÑ,btohqsg
oh lmao  for some reason i keep thinking now's 2024 üòÇ,btohqsg
maybe will wait out till uob annouce if they will extend the 6miles per dollar first. cos now to next year end feb very fast wor.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see why u are waiting. There is no annual fee stopping u.,btohqsg
cos dun have past 3 months of payslip,btohqsg

If u have uob card while in your previous job u can just add uob lady.,btohqsg

i don't think got hard and fast ruleit also depends (in my view) on your length of relationship with UOB.I have been with all the major credit card banks since my first job. I never had much (maybe a few 'harder' cards) trouble getting annual fee waivers.,btohqsg
U can use maybank PV  and earn $100 cashback over 3 months for 1k spend per month. Half of premium is considered eligible spend  ie 2500 x 50% = 1250,btohqsg

You paid for simmons via Atome or shopback paylater ? MCC 5999,btohqsg

Hi experts  recently I kena a fraudulent overseas transaction of $2k+ on my HSBC Revo. Blocked the card immediately but the transaction still went through.

Will the miles be clawed back after the investigation (assuming they refund the amount) ? Thank youüôè,btohqsg
Mcc 5999 will kena 1 percent charge de. Not sure why simmon fall under the 5999 but merchant mcc at time will not relate to the nature of the busines,btohqsg

Able to share how to look out for mall voucher sales or when they happen? Thank you!,btohqsg
look out for email by those mall membership program and check back the app also and maybe here also if people share.,btohqsg
if harvey can consider buy at suntec mall as they got voucher sales of 100 at 95 till 31 oct (while stock last) but their payment terminal is excluded for rewards,btohqsg
great world city have recent sales of buy 100 and get 110 for oct and can used at best denki and earn cc rewards but fully redeem already,btohqsg
fraser just have sales of buy 200 get 215 for their gift card and fully sold within a few days  so these need to be track by own diligence de.,btohqsg
I am a cashback pax as priority then by miles collection.,btohqsg
Citi premiers is 1.2 miles per dollar spend.5 x $1.2k = $6k => 7200 miles.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know why is the Chocolate Finance website under maintenance for such a long time?,btohqsg
Wah that's alot of difference ah with the uob,btohqsg
But if only I use the card then I can only get miles within 3k . Any extra expenditure wont be factored in. So I still need to use another card for the remaining 3 people?,btohqsg
citi premiers no spend limit to earn. citi rewards  UOB Ladies (Not solitaire version) and HSBC Revo only first $1k earn the 4x. so if u spend more than $1k then def need a card that can earn more rewards or miles  with that higher spend rate,btohqsg
Another thing. If I want to buy flight ticket can I just buy from the merchant itself? Like buy from qantas instead of going through agoda? Cause agoda is like way more ex,btohqsg
I still can get the 1.2miles on premiermiles and 6 miles on uob card(within 3k)? Cause I saw some people say use agoda?,btohqsg
i think most people buy flight ticket direct from airlines as that usually have the most options to choose from. Booking through third party have their own problem when it come to changes of flight etc,btohqsg
but spreading out the miles earn over too many different bank may have its own issue if you are not big spender consistently on those different card as you might have expiring point issue ( not enough to convert to miles)  each bank conversion cost money  different expiry to track for each card/each bank. so it is really up to individual preference on how they want to play the miles games,btohqsg
Wow. That's very comprehensive. Thank you so much queenie.,btohqsg
Everyone game plan is different so take advice with a pinch of salt. Only u know your spending pattern and what suit you best.,btohqsg

5%pa on entire $100k.Need $500 credit card spend.,btohqsg
3 giro transactions OR salary credit of 1600.The 7.8 is from 75k to 100k.So if you average out the tiered rates  effective interest is 5 percent.,btohqsg
After the 30 days money market fund promotion  where would you guys be putting your spare cash?,btohqsg

I can? Let me read more in detail..I have stash account‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Sad... Previously cap was 3k USD. Think that will come back next month?,btohqsg
Does it mean if i have a stash account  i can put in additional 50k  100k or 200k and i will get the cash amount at the end of the earmarked period and also i will earn the 3% interest each month?,btohqsg
yes  get cashback once funds earnarked. 3% is for 100k,btohqsg
+ the 3% in stashaccount or the 5% uob one interest each month?,btohqsg
usual effective 3% for $100k in stash account. $50k or $200k gets much lower effective interest,btohqsg
Are all these safe in car webull collapse?,btohqsg
did u empty out uob one account on 30 sep?,btohqsg
I have an existing stash account but min bal in there,btohqsg
Thinking to dep 100k into that and if possible open another stash account for another 100k deposit. Can earn 3% on both stash + 1500 cash. Not sure if that will work,btohqsg
Ya  but i want to maximise the interest in stash  max 100k else min interest if im depoaiting 200k,btohqsg
only one cashback on 1 account  cannot combine deposit in 2 accounts,btohqsg
Oh bummer  0.05% interest on the othr 100k if i deposit 200k into stash,btohqsg
better put 100k into another high interest account in another bank,btohqsg
Yeah my cash now in ocbc div+ so actually not much diff,btohqsg

U can search for card that gave 4 mpd for paywave like uob prefer plat  uob visa signature and get merchant to spilt the bill according to reward cap,btohqsg
Time to switch to iPhone and at the same time can prevent hackers :),btohqsg
Thanks! What‚Äôs the difference between pref plat and visa signature? Visa signature seems to include overseas spending too.,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone using CIMB World mastercard and CIMB visa signature card? Are there any benefits in using either of them?,btohqsg
If we pay for vendors like zip track and decking etc? I think that they are also not considered as any particular mcc code?,btohqsg
As long as mcc not excluded  using mobile paywave will get 4 miles per dollar up to the card cap which u can read up on,btohqsg
Any cash back card is better than Citibank‚Äôs ?,btohqsg

Hi all experts  newbie here..Recently applied for the Uob EVOL  and tried to clock the min $600  besides the online and mobile payment total $500  usually where you guys charge the another $100? Checked the T&C  it looked like a lot of exclusions.I tried searching through the group but did not find any info answer my question. Thanks in advanced üôè,btohqsg
Oh no my available balance is still the same as the current balance  it seemed that UOB did not reduce it by the same amount I have submitted for the National Day promotion. I‚Äôll call the CSO to check. Thank you Sir for your advice! üôèüèª,btohqsg
When did you put the money in,btohqsg
I transferred it on 28 September,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/136888It is always earmarked one month after the money is put in.If u put in $100k in September. Earmark happens near end October,btohqsg

Hi all  been using amaze + citi rewards for payments to my clinic visits  and been getting 4mpd of those transactions.But understand now amaze charges for payments to healthcare institutions....so what would the next best card be for Miles rewards?? Thank you so much!!,btohqsg
Anyone knows about ichange? If yes? Is it better than YouTrip?,btohqsg
Does citi rewards via Google pay qualify as online transaction?,btohqsg
Thanks  which means it won't qualify for 4mpd yea?,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc need to be online,btohqsg
if more than $1k local spend in a month can paywave using uob visa signature,btohqsg
how does scb esaver work   maybank isavvy work,btohqsg
the remaining $100 just spend as per normal on non-excluded and hit $600. That's what is meant by you earn 8% on $500  but actually effective is 6.67% on $600 spend.,btohqsg
Thank you again. Can I kindly clarify to get 4mpd via DBS WWMC  only online transactions valid? And since amaze cannot pair with it already  kinda means it's not a top choice for day to day use?,btohqsg
Maybe not a top choice for u. Plus dbs wwmc point expire one year from now,btohqsg
Thank you so much. So after I've maxed out $1k on amaze + citi rewards  what's the next best day to day combo?,btohqsg
Erm really depend on your spending habit. Just asking in general wont give u helpful answer,btohqsg
Hi all  does it make sense to use instalment payments for higher value items e.g Apple products to hit minimum monthly spend for credit cards?,btohqsg
Installment dont count towards monthly spend,btohqsg
Unless u use app like atome,btohqsg
I personally will be willing to tank that 1% charge since no other cards from what I know can beat the (4mpd - 1%cash) reward as of now,btohqsg
Hi All  What is the best miles card to purchase apple products?,btohqsg
Noted. But barring any specific MCC  what are your suggestions after maxing the citi rewards  for miles? Just curious what the experts do üòäüòä,btohqsg
Paywave can consider uob prefer plat,btohqsg
"Thanks. What's the effective ""cashback"" for 4mpd again?",btohqsg
for cashback use cashback cards lah,btohqsg
Hi folks  pairing UOB EVOL with Shopback counts as Online Spend right?,btohqsg
What I meant is  with 4mpd - 1% cash (as amaze is charging that for certain MCCs now) is it still very much worth it ??,btohqsg
largely yes  assuming no better alternatives,btohqsg
Anyone successfully book a flight thru DBS Expedia link recently? I've been having problem checking out  the page just keeps saying error,btohqsg
Have you compare the air ticket price quoted by Expedia vs ticket price quoted by other website such asTrip.comand airline website? Is the price the same?Which airline you plan to book?,btohqsg
Up to your valuation  I personally value it similarly to Chris at 1.25 cents per mile,btohqsg
"NormalExpedia.com.sgis working fine  the ticket price for Expedia dbs link is actually slightly cheaper and I get to earn 6 miles  but I keep getting an error message saying ""we weren't able to proceed with your booking""",btohqsg
Air Asia indonesia  but I tried selecting Singapore airlines and got the same error on checkout,btohqsg
Any thoughts on crypto nowadays ?,btohqsg
Have you read the DBS-Expedia TnC? Air Asia Indonesia and Singapore Airlines are not the participating airlines  hence  you likely will not get the extra miles (6mpd) you want.,btohqsg
Oh? Let me check that  thanks,btohqsg
Man this really sucks  I always thought I'll get 6mpd using altitude on dbs Expedia if I can find the flights there  I missed out that term with participating airline only  good to know thouDbs altitude card really suck now then,btohqsg

hi all  does paying insurance premiums using the UOB EVOL credit card contribute to the $600 minimum spend?,btohqsg
Does air ticket purchased online using citi smrt count as online spending and eligible for 5% rebate?,btohqsg
For cash rebate? I dont think so,btohqsg
but does it counts as $600 minimum spend?,btohqsg
If it does not count for rebate it dont count towards minimum spend.,btohqsg
My understanding of the T&C is that yes  it counts towards min spend (which i believe is 500 not 600),btohqsg
count to $500 min spend for uob one account bonus interest  but dun count to $600 min spend for rebate on uob evol,btohqsg
What if I submitted a Tbill but amount is insufficient?  Eg I submit 2K but my CPFIA and Cpf OA less the 20K only has 1K.  Will my transaction fail?  Or will it allocate 1k?  This is becos I have forgotten that I have an insurance to be paid üòî,btohqsg

I suggest Do your due diligence on why Reits are doing so badly now  and what‚Äôs their prospects in the future. Start by drilling into their balance sheet and their debt servicing details instead of WALE  etc. good luck üëçüèª,btohqsg

End of second business day of next month,btohqsg
My view is that there is another issue (besides business slowing down)  all the Reits  many of their fixed rates loans (hence costs calculation) in their current balance sheet still need to be revalued (mark to market)  and I think 2024/25 will be these times. This is their business nature (highly leveraged entities). If you think interest rates are staying higher for longer  this will impact their earnings too. Hope that helps you to mitigate your risks in them‚Ä¶ good luck,btohqsg

very little cashback  its never worth it. usually the strategy is to get the DBS WWMC card (worlds women mastercard) to clock online spending for 4mpd. $2k/mth or 8k miles per month limit. the points pool with DBS Altitude which used to be a great card for booking SQ flights 3mpd  expedia sometimes 6mpd... but now it has been nerfed,btohqsg
I‚Äôm planning to book tickets on Expedia  I saw the price is kinda the same from other websites and I can get 6mpd with DBS altitude cardüòÇ so I want to figure out if it is worth it since I seldom use this card and it will take a long time for me to redeem the miles in this card‚Ä¶ but I will keep this card for the free lounge passes as long as the annual fee is waivedü§£,btohqsg

May I know where did u read that it is 4.5% for up to $360K? Thanks!,btohqsg
Oh ya i didnt even notice their terms abit different from the past. So to earn the maximum 4.5% (3.5% +1%)  will have to topup between $100k to $360k from 1 Nov onwards. Now deposit don't earn 3.5%,btohqsg
it should be up to 2 million top up compare to sep adb,btohqsg
sms to signup now and top up from 1 nov onward,btohqsg
Additional 1% from HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme's terms and conditions is capped at $300 which equals to deposit equivalent of $360k,btohqsg
if you have 360k  u can opt for premier banking which up to 500 per month,btohqsg
u just need 200k to have a hsbc premier and i believe this promo is target at such customer due to the minimum top up value to be from 100k onwards,btohqsg
Sounds like a lot of money üòÖ,btohqsg
"the 1% only for first mth right? since 2nd mth the amount wont be considered ""incremental"" liao",btohqsg
it is given for month of nov and dec  reference month is sep. So if the monthly adb is 2k in sep  u can top up max 300k excluding any other bill/ giro that also take up the ega cap of 300.,btohqsg
for premier banking would be 15k plus max 500k to get the extra 1 percent per month for everyday 1 percent  excluding bill/giro. so not sure how the 360k is been calculated,btohqsg
Terms and conditions stated for bonus interest  the cap of $300 is applicable for all customers segment. The $500 is referring to the total cashback for premier customers is referring to including cashback for credit card spends and giro.,btohqsg
there was no stated of cap in the tnc i posted before.,btohqsg
so just follow the normal customer cap of 300 and premier customer of 500,btohqsg
ok i saw where u coming from but where does the 360 is been calculated still. with 300k incremental max out the 1 personal and plus the adb in sep,btohqsg
Hope this makes it clear enough for you. Terms and condition is very clear. You have misunderstood,btohqsg
($360000 *0.01) / 12 months = $300 cashback for bonus interest,btohqsg
ok  was focus on the promotion tnc and not the everyday 1 percent. my mistake,btohqsg
Yes the 1% for incremental will only be for Nov as it compare with previous month balance which is Oct. So Dec will compare with Nov But for the 3.5%  both Nov and Dec compares with Sep.Now got 2 terms and conditions to read  so can get abit confusing. ü§£,btohqsg
is the current promo for webull or moomoo better for new users signup  say the amount is around sgd 30k?,btohqsg
How long does moomoo withdrawal take?,btohqsg

So to max out this promo  top up 360k will earn me effective 4% pa for Nov and dec rite?  4.5% for nov and 3.5% for dec,btohqsg
1. Is this card only or other cards in your Google Pay also has the same issue?2. Remove the card from your Google pay/wallet and re-add it in. If you can't re-add it  call the bank to request the CSO to re-issue the token for your card for mobile wallets.,btohqsg
Feedback liao but don't see Heymax updates the data also..,btohqsg
I thought the 600 min spend promo ends at Oct. From Nov onwards will go back to 800 min spend?,btohqsg
That 300 and this 300/500 are 2 different things. The first 300 is the addition 1% interest compare to your previous month's ADB. Premier or not max you only can get 300.The other 300/500 is the rebate from your CC spend or GIRO. 300 for normal account  500 for premier.,btohqsg

Probably Department Stores. My Lego purchase was Department Stores,btohqsg
i'll go check with UOB on my purchase. But anyway if you use Krispay just use UOB KF for uncapped 3 mpd!,btohqsg

Hi  I‚Äôm looking to buy USJ tickets on the USJ website. Is it better to use Revolut or Amaze + Citi rewards?,btohqsg
Cheaper via klook? I didn‚Äôt compare exactly. But I bought via klook for the convenience.Use the card which gives you online rewards?,btohqsg
The annual pass is only avail on the website  not Klook,btohqsg
The card has travel exclusions that why I‚Äôm asking to check if any experts know,btohqsg
Typically won't. Some fringe cases they do change their MCC but most of the time it's like they have a branch on kris+ and it's usually the same.Anyway I confirmed with UOB and the MCC of SK via Krispay is 5999,btohqsg
So it's like atome MCC ?,btohqsg
I guess? this is specific to SK on Krispay  I dunno about other merchants,btohqsg

but ezlink and mastercard are not related?,btohqsg
ezlink wallet is tied to mastercard,btohqsg
Based on the 1070 and the 1240the total sum gotten from the age 65 - 80 is about 192kthe total sum gotten from age 67-80 is about 193k,btohqsg
Ok  so actually not much diff for both. So maybe withdraw from 65 will be better. üôè,btohqsg
If apply 3.94%  100% will allocate?,btohqsg
ahh now it make sense  i just check the app and it stated payment with ez-link card wallet with mastercard are currently unavailable,btohqsg
Depends on your father‚Äôs needs? If not in real need for cash  he can opt for a lower payout and let the rest earn interest in cpf. (My parents asked for a lower payout as they see no need to draw down too much and end up sit in bank),btohqsg
Okie. Thanks for your advice. üòäüëç,btohqsg
All card shared the same limit  so u can just apply thru uob app,btohqsg
i can apply for secured card through uob app?,btohqsg
U have uob secured card already right  for next uob card just apply online,btohqsg
How to perform the transaction using non-FAST? Through Paynow?,btohqsg
But one can only have one Paynow account. Unless you have your money transfer to say your mother  and have your mother Paynow you tagged with ‚ÄúSalary‚Äù ? Is that how one do it ?,btohqsg
"depending which bank u transferring from  need to uncheck FAST option or choose ""GIRO"" as method etc. Also need to choose purpose as Salary Payment from dropdown list.",btohqsg
Just withdraw from 65 loh  then do the RA 1 to 1 match 600 per year,btohqsg
My dad OA still have  so pump over to RA to full 60k while withdrawing to get max interest on RA,btohqsg
So while withdrawing  i keep top up when it fall under 60k for RA,btohqsg
This is final right ? Means everyone is 3.95%,btohqsg
Just apply on uob online banking or app will do le. The credit team will approve de. I got quite alot of uob card for secured after 1st card,btohqsg
wowww thank you for the info!!,btohqsg
Right now i think only encountee hsbc need 1 secured fd per card,btohqsg
