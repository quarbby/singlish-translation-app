Singapore Storms Back Toward Pre-Virus Levels of Air Traffic1. Airlines in Asia are bringing back international capacity as the region gradually follows North America and Europe in reopening borders  led by the city-state of Singapore  whose economy depends on open access.2. By January  Singapore is poised to reach 84% of the weekly flights to Europe as it had in March last year  before the clampdown on travel. And there’ll be 1 519 flights from the financial hub to elsewhere in Asia  compared with only 194 in May 2020  data from aviation analytics firm Cirium show.3. Since the opening of more travel lanes  demand from Singapore has been strongest for flights within Asia -- with some fares surging. From December to January  ahead of the Lunar New Year and Beijing Winter Olympics  airlines plan the biggest monthly jump in flights from the island nation to the region since Cirium started providing the data in 2000.Refinitiv data ofSIA(<<== Click and login) on POEMS.Refinitiv data ofSATS(<<== Click and login) on POEMS.More here,btohqsg
