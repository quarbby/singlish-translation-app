being in poly has taught me something intresting,btohqsg
Adware is not illegala malware that randomly recommend you random pop-up apps,btohqsg

WHY AM I SEEING SO MORE GEN ZS ON THE MRT HOLDING KOREAN POSTERS,btohqsg

For the US to openly ask for spies to spy on russia....Its sending a message to Russia but i wonder what message,btohqsg
trying to destroy the enemy from within,btohqsg
meaning US intelligence knows/suspects Russia is crumbling from within alr,btohqsg
recently  Prigozhin (leader of Wagner) also openly scolded Putin,btohqsg
and also Russia is a very dire state. Ukraine invasion is life or death for them and recently they just announced they would offer citizenships for foreign volunteers which shows they have manpower shortage alr,btohqsg
but it might be US crumbling as well. china is set in a position where it has the ability to overtake the US in the world order. and the last time a power shift occured  a world war happened ah,btohqsg
large scale infra projects puts them in extremely heavy debt,btohqsg
not true  they outsource their debt,btohqsg
they borrow money to lend other people money,btohqsg
u see their belt and road initiative is paid for by the benefiting nations. if they default their debt  their surrender control to China for example the Sri Lankan port that will be under Chinese control for the next 99 years. not only China  spend $0  they get free money generators around the world. coupled together with the fact that many of these 'benefitting' nations get closer ties with China meaning UN votes and resolutions will go China's way,btohqsg
previously there were hundred+ nations who recognize Taiwan as the real china due to the One china policy.  Now less than 10 recognize Taiwan and who knows what would happen if that number becomes 0. PRC might see it as a justification to invade Taiwan and boom  US is in war.US has 31T debt including government bonds  they won't be able to fund the war unless they default on their debt. Which means no matter the outcome of the victor in a hypothetical US-CN war  a power shift will definitely occur,btohqsg
bought some shares at a happy price,btohqsg
how to make that even realistic,btohqsg
