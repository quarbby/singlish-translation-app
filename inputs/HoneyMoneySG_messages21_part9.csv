How is the Citi charges for oversea swipe? YouTrip and Revolut has the good conversion rate. But Revolut has extra charges on weekend,btohqsg
It will use amaze X change rate at a spread of 1-2% right?,btohqsg
Im abit mixed personally if to use CRMC + Amaze or Revolut Metal for my upcoming trip too hahhaa...(the 4mpd does feel worth the slightly bad spread but then again....),btohqsg
Anyone has suggestions on which card to use for mcc 7311 (ads)?,btohqsg
No need to hold  should appear in rewards section in cash voucher,btohqsg
If you're a registered business  Airwallex currently has a promotion where they give 5% cashback on ad spend I think,btohqsg
Unfortunately i'm a property agent so no registered business ðŸ˜‚ and there's a cap of 200sgd cashback a month  and total 600sgd cashback cap. So not quite worth to go thru the trouble...But thanks for sharing!!!!,btohqsg

Must redeem the cash voucher from rewards  then can withdraw from cash balance,btohqsg
is it like moo moo. need to spend the cash voucher like execute  a trade with the corresponding amt then you only get the money when the stock is sold?,btohqsg
No need to execute trade for Webull to redeem the cash  it's not a stock rebate voucher,btohqsg

just called them. they say after meet all criteria (including min 2k for 30days) + 1-7days then the usd$150 will be in the in-transit tab. so 30+ days then can see the voucher feedback. i nv asked about the referral feedback.,btohqsg
Hi everyone!I am new here and I would like to seek some advise from everyone here.I recently placed $40k fixed deposit with UOB.Now that the UOB One account has increased the interest rate to payout 5% PA on interest for the first $100k  I am looking to open that account and deposit another $100k.That would effectively mean that I will have $140k worth of deposits with UOB. May I please seek some advise from this group with regards to the SDIC coverage? Will it be $75k coverage for the entire UOB deposit or will it be $75k coverage for Fixed Deposit  and another $75k coverage for the $100k deposit? Meaning the remaining $25k from the $100k will not be covered.Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Effective is 2.6% but that 1% is not direct rebate but in the form of points which u need to accumulate up in blocks of 1000 or something before it can be used to offset a future purchase.Regardless  foreign exchange fees of cards is usually 3.25% so  2.6% minus 3.25% is already -0.65%. Then remember  bank Fx spreads is damn bad. Means u wonâ€™t get the same rate as google conversion but some rate thatâ€™s in favour of the bank.Likely  the bad Fx spread will cause your -0.65% to be even lower. Meaning u will confirm plus chop lose $.Edit: I stand corrected.Amaze converts the foreign spend to Sgd then charges to the card. Skipping the foreign exchange fee of the card. So u are right.,btohqsg
Deposit in $2k. But stock worth at least $100 USD. U can sell immediately if u want. Bottom like  do not withdraw any cash for the full 30 days. U can check your progress and how many days left in your profile page.Note:Buying $100 USD worth of stocks only gets u $100 USD rewards.If u want the remaining $50 USD rewards  u need to do 1 options trade. If u never do the latter  u only get $100 USD.At the end of the 30 days  WeBull will alert u or u can manually check your progress. Regardless  it will take about 7 business days for the $ to be credited back into your account.,btohqsg
I use YouTrip. Fuss free spending  better exchange rate than Amaze  no weird spending timing charges over weekends or weird hours of the day.Resolut I use to withdraw cash overseas. Can withdraw up to $350 daily. No fees.YouTrip need to pay $5 per withdrawal.,btohqsg
1st $75k with the bank as an entity.Means if UOB close shop  SDIC protects $75k out of your $40k+$100k only,btohqsg
Clearly understood! Thanks a lot Zan!,btohqsg
If u have alot of cash  diversity it across more banks  put into SG savings bonds (capital guaranteed up to $200k) or put into brokerages eg Moomoo  Tiger  WeBull which are all MAS approved and protected behind multiple layers of insurances.,btohqsg
Definitely will explore those areas too! Still in the process of learning right now as I just started my career. Thanks a lot buddy!,btohqsg
Yup. I am relatively a low risk taker and this gives a lot of assurance. Thanks a lot Zan!,btohqsg
Anyway  u should checkout the Fullerton Cash Fund (SGD) provided by all 3 brokers as a low risk alternative than the banks higher yield savings accounts because these just give u straight returns accrued daily without any hoops to jump thro unlike banks.,btohqsg
Yeah but Youtrip do not have MYR and THB. Good for JPY  EURO and CHF though,btohqsg
I would very much like to look into this fund. I'll research about it! Thank you!!,btohqsg
Actually while u canâ€™t hold the currency or exchanging it prior to your trip to lock in the rates  that doesnâ€™t stop u from spending using it.YouTrip will still covert MYR to SGD n deduct from your wallet.Yes YouTrip only can hold 10 currencies but supports hundreds more.But this MAS approved digital wallet only allows u max $5k SGD. So unless u are some money changer or something  exchanging large sums of currency to take advantage of forex spreads shouldnâ€™t be the main reason for stocking up foreign currency. Remember  YouTrip doesnâ€™t allow withdrawals of funds back to bank account. Unless u withdraw cash overseas via ATM but thatâ€™ll cost you $5 per withdrawal.Also doesnâ€™t make sense u withdraw so much cash overseas such that u have to declare on the way back.Alternatively u can try other multi currency wallets n see if they have the currency u want. Then u can do the exchange in-app.,btohqsg
YouTrip stores 10 currencies but supports hundreds more. See this example when I went Thailand last time. It converts Thai Baht to Sgd and deducts from my YouTrip wallet.https://support.you.co/hc/en-us/articles/900000378763-Which-currencies-are-supported-,btohqsg
Ic  thanks. Question is you will not be able to know the rate before spendingâ€¦ know is not much  but personally I dun feel good spending without knowing the rate.,btohqsg
Hmmm just did a live compare. Seems like Youtrip use without knowing the rate seems better? Assuming bank commission for master portal is 0%.,btohqsg
Correct u wonâ€™t know coz it fluctuates by the second.But remember  the equation goes both ways. Even if u are able to lock in good rates  if u want to exchange those foreign currency back to SGD  it might take a while for the weaker currency to improve. Some never do.,btohqsg
Youtrip is 26.11  Revolut is 25.86,btohqsg
Not using it for forex. Just overseas spend hehe.,btohqsg
Thanks  will try Youtrip during ny next bkk trip,btohqsg
Deduct from your youtrip sgd wallet?,btohqsg
I mean if u exchange so much foreign  currency at a good rate but never spend it all  then u want to change it back to SGD  I doubt the rates would improve so much.,btohqsg
Most likely wont change back  just leave it for next trip.,btohqsg
