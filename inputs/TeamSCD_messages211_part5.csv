That time i saw it was a chubby guy in msia pump petrol,btohqsg
No la is because take time and effort to fix up to what it is,btohqsg

Check if your A/C is onIf engine running check any of the radiator fans is spinningIf above 2 items is doing fine Must be Compressor is failing or it's components,btohqsg

Can Bc racing shock absorbers for mk6  can fit in scirocco 1.4?,btohqsg

Hey guys anyone knows how much to put rigid collars and what does it help,btohqsg
I love Gundam but I don‚Äôt appreciate the new graphic haizzz,btohqsg
"""Tightens"" up / reduce free play in your car chassis. $ ranges depending on the brand. For my Honda fit  there are $100 options up to $400 options.",btohqsg
Dunnid to know why just install,btohqsg
As explained here  as your subframe is bolted to your main frame  there will be a play at the joint,btohqsg
Rigid collars just removes that lor,btohqsg
But like all mods that stiffens up car  just rmb if the slop is stiffened up  the vibrations will have to go somewhere else,btohqsg
So it will undoubtedly cause more wear to your main chassis,btohqsg
Ohh so actually it‚Äôs good or bad haha,btohqsg
I guess it will nvr end,btohqsg
Always ask yourself what u want to achieve,btohqsg
No such thing is all good one,btohqsg
Do remember that it is a one time use only. As long as you get new ones  it is fine. I‚Äôve seen people trying to sell away their used one and it is actually not recommended to get them for the reason that the collars are moulded or crushed when you install them.,btohqsg
Dont blindly mod what people say is good‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I definitely want less vibration of the car,btohqsg
As in u want to FEEL less vibration,btohqsg
Yah definitely thanks man. Im using a new one,btohqsg
Ikr. When I saw that person trying to sell it‚Ä¶,btohqsg
In which case rigid collar is not the correct mod,btohqsg
Less road rolling sound look to your tyres,btohqsg
install rigid collar means more vibrations,btohqsg
Less engine vibration look to engine mounts,btohqsg
Doing up my drive shafts and tie rods at the same time,btohqsg
the slop stop absorbing vibrations means your whole car now will vibrate,btohqsg
Engine mounts still working fine just check,btohqsg
Less harsh ride  look to softer/new oem dampers and even spring,btohqsg
Eh sorry less harsh ride this is what im trying to get,btohqsg
Look to your suspension system as a whole,btohqsg
Even your rims and tyres affect.,btohqsg
Yeap but just changing the cover. Whereas for tie rods.changing the whole thing haha,btohqsg
Smaller rims and higher tyre profile will be a gentler ride.,btohqsg
And actually more economical fuel wise.,btohqsg
I seat my friend integra totall different thing from my car. He changed to tein coilover.,btohqsg
Im currently on 17 inch rims,btohqsg
My experience with tein is it was a very harsh ride even for a 2 year old suspension,btohqsg
Wah means mine not economy le,btohqsg
On the sporty side already. Aesthetically speaking,btohqsg
So yea it‚Äôs definitely a ‚Äúlooks‚Äù category and not ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù,btohqsg
not too thin but not too thick,btohqsg
