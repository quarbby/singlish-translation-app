Hi all expert  for cimb promotion  I noticed if you deposit above 75 000  interest drop. I have 1 021 SGD as of 31 Aug. Does it mean I can top up 74 000 SGD to get 3.5%? Tq in advance,btohqsg
You will incurred 3% platform fee if your payment is above 200 rmb. And plus the forex spread😂,btohqsg
But I top up the sum yesterday.. how to check if qualify?,btohqsg
I set a recurring transfer to my EGA on my UOB one account for $2000 on the 1st of every month. This month the transaction did not happen on the 1st as it is a Sunday but it didn’t happen on Monday as well.I manually transferred the $2000 but it has now ruined my plan to keep $1000 MAB.Did it happen to somebody else as well or is it a peculiarity of UOB One account I’m not aware of?,btohqsg
Can advice if I buy air tickets from SQ but in foreign currency using Amaze. Will it consider as local spend or overseas spend?,btohqsg
It will be considered a local online spend as Amaze will convert it using their exchange rate to SGD,btohqsg
Are there any cards including cashback cards that have rebates for changi hospital when buying medicine  it does not take amexOr it's none for public hospitals? Thanks,btohqsg
I heard can ask the merchant in China to split into multiple 200rmb payments to circumvent that 3%. 😬But if cannot  any suggestion what's the best method to use for paying for expenses in China?,btohqsg
Seems like a HSBC issue lol. Better to self transfer if 11am they haven't process. That's the timing they usually process my recurring transfers anyway.,btohqsg
Not aware can search sms  thank you 🙏,btohqsg
hi sorry  would like to know ur trf is due to the uob quarterly promo?Do u do it like once every quarter?,btohqsg
Yes  will be a few days  do you know when we will receive the 0.5% interest?,btohqsg
Not so high  unless you withdraw the month end interest,btohqsg
Hello all  Have you all gotten the interest for uob one account for this month?,btohqsg
The 2 magic numbers if u did it right for $151 000.,btohqsg
If today  how much need to deposit?,btohqsg
Hi all for hsbc ega  how does the 30 days fresh fund work? Assuming if I have just started this month and deposited $10k..the next day I withdraw $6k and the following day I redeposit back $20k...What will be my fresh fund?,btohqsg
Will my fresh fund still be considered as $24k? Please advise,btohqsg
I could answer that. But unless u intend to ask every month  learning to figure it out would be more beneficial. The community here will be glad to help you check your answer 😁To start @mttelegrammthas shown us before how to do it herehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/217619,btohqsg
"May i ask why ""151000"" and not 150000?",btohqsg
1k is way overkill i guess. I put 600 in on first of every month to have like a 4  days buffer. Means even if the month ends with a 4 days holiday/non-banking days  it still works.,btohqsg
"Just based on t&c  24k is ""fresh"".",btohqsg
Hi may I check if anyone still keep track of UOB Lady’s Card signup promotion? I can’t remember clearly or find anywhere what was their April’24 signup promo. I called in and ask they also don’t know. Lmao!,btohqsg
Dont they count by MAB of the month compared to previous month? Shdnt he count using the average of his end daily balances?,btohqsg
"Based on t&c  the ""fresh funds"" MAB is calculated after determining what is considered ""fresh funds"".",btohqsg
Till today got no dp that the 30 days rule is being enforced strictly.,btohqsg
I want to book Japan train ticket via Klook  so shop via Max is better than buy gift card?,btohqsg

Good morning all  I’m looking for a new broadband plan at home for my dual key unit  will be shared with my neighbour. Anyone has good recommendations?,btohqsg
The thing is there is no way to know because that clause was added for the July-Aug cycle where interest is received only in Oct.,btohqsg

I have both UOB Lady and DBS WWMC that can cater for travel expenses.,btohqsg

"Ya.. i am also waiting@mttelegrammtto share if the final withdrawal at last day is being captured by the July EGA ""fresh fund"" definition and enforced. But as mentioned  we probably only know in Oct.",btohqsg
That's true 🤣 I thought it was there since May but seems like it's only Jul that they added the clause.,btohqsg
For June EGA when will the interest be credited? Is it end of Sep?,btohqsg
Actually I always wondered what’s the actual percentage of HSBC EGA participants who actually end up getting the promised 3.x% + 1%.Clearly the tncs are not easy to navigate and spread out over more than 1 documents. Also it is intentionally (in my view) confusing and not easy to understand. Also I feel it is not easy to teach someone to follow exactly.Suspect the product manager team is smart to make it such that not everyone will get what’s promised due to ownself mess up. And this is why the program is still sustainable.Otherwise I am unsure how they can sustain the payout rate.Like Uob finally surrender and killed off amaze + Uob.,btohqsg
Hi experts out here  I deposited 500 on first of this month for my OCBC360 acc. Today go in check my ABD is showing as 252.33 instead 🧐Things noted was transaction date for the 500 FAST transfer was on 1st sep but value date is at 2nd sep. Do anyone know why it wasn’t anywhere near 500?This is the 2nd month though  first month (late Aug) I open the account and put 100k - salary not credited in on that month  received an interest of 2.46 for that month though 😅,btohqsg
Kerry sorry  hoping on this toosay we deposit 2k for salary to 360. for the Save component  i'd like to confirm  we still have to add another 500 on top of the 2k to increase the monthly average balance by 500 from the previous month?,btohqsg
2k salary can contribute to 500 save component. I usually withdraw out and leave just enough for 500 increase.,btohqsg
thanks Anthony! a follow up question.. i used the calculator on the 360 page and set ADB to be 1 000 and checked off the Salary and Save components  it's roughly 3.28%. how does one get 4.05%?,btohqsg
Becos you get different interest rate at higher/different ADB tiers. Try keying in 100k for ADB. U will see the 4.05%,btohqsg
3.28% for first 75k. You put 100k the result will be different.,btohqsg
"Just to note  ur 2k is not ""deposit"" by yourself. Becos it wont work  unless its by corporate account deposited as salary.Individual days of incremental amount doesnt equate to the actual increase in the ADB. U need to calculate your ADB like thishttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/217619",btohqsg
If I have 2 cards linked to Amaze (Citi Rewards & UOB KF) will amaze charge me 1% fee for transactions above $1000 for total cumulative spend or is the > $1K spend confined by cards? Example  if I spend 1k on Citi via Amaze  can I still spend another 1k on UOB KF via Amaze?,btohqsg
Hi.. Has anyone used Uob One CC for Cardup? Any issues?,btohqsg
1% fee for combined local spend above 1k,btohqsg
no card rebate  dun count to min spend  dun count to card spend for one account bonus interest,btohqsg
Hi I'm thinking to open HSBC EGA account due to its 1% giro cashback.may I know what thing I should take note of?,btohqsg
