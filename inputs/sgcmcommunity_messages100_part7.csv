No but a 523i e60 is a... 2007 car. Even a F10 523i 2010 can be found under a 100k,btohqsg
what doesn't add up? the fact that he got carrot,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not the fact he got a shit car,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the fact he paid too much for it,btohqsg
so he got carrot and lemon,btohqsg
this one is ownself shoot ownself,btohqsg
Not carrot. He mega loan out the wazoo,btohqsg
He nvr even do basic due diligence,btohqsg
at least he never full loan aveo,btohqsg
So many tell tale sign yet he still want to proceed. Wah bian.... üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
u want cry to media but u also stupid,btohqsg
The dealer also promote 0 down,btohqsg
I have a feeling the 100k whatever is the inflated price showed on the papers,btohqsg
Lai evo X 3xxx per month who want,btohqsg
even our aveo friend is no decimal place,btohqsg
The 500 can use for repair,btohqsg
But I believe it's a full loan inflated price in the article,btohqsg
Precisely... something really not right. Asiaone also nvr do a simple due diligence and check prices,btohqsg
Asia one probably saw the purchase agreement which has the high price listed,btohqsg
Never give it a second look,btohqsg
Or ask the guy for his down payment,btohqsg
I kena covid noone interview me,btohqsg
i never see a insta page where their whole purpose is to glorify and promote full loan,btohqsg
Istg I think if 0 down dont exist,btohqsg
you never declare you got covid also,btohqsg
most used car dealers with a specific type of inventory heading that way now,btohqsg
Next time I kena covid  I email them,btohqsg
from lower end to higher end,btohqsg
Now bike also got 0 down  10 year loan,btohqsg
There is a target demographic for that.,btohqsg
just that they would be cheaper to buy on the used market,btohqsg
especially for certain types of cars,btohqsg
sg shud put law to max30% dp,btohqsg
and there would be more car sharing cars and rentals out there,btohqsg
this is a joke later the boomers flame me,btohqsg
also MAS rules say minimum 30% already,btohqsg
hence the inflated prices on purchase agreements for full loans,btohqsg
which is being exploited by some very well,btohqsg
just that many are making poor financial decisions based on it,btohqsg
or rather if sg full loan law was very very strictly regulated  car meet would be very empty,btohqsg
In other note... byd botting game strong.,btohqsg
Liberty Walk Founder - Japanese  Name Kato üò±,btohqsg
