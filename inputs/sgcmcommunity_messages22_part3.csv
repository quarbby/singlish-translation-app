sir why you so sensitive with emotion i know you like euro cars,btohqsg
i like cars that dont go kaboom right after an engine rebuilt,btohqsg
hahahah sorry i’m very naive 😭,btohqsg
does your favourite car have euro ncap 5 stars?,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA its all banter😂😂 i love wrx and forester STI 😂😂,btohqsg
You got one chance to like one  after that just burn paper one can already,btohqsg
VA STI is a really good looking car imo,btohqsg
super solid car dude HAHAHA ❤️,btohqsg
cannot anyhow say i euro car guy and naive hor  i love subaru and honda 😄,btohqsg
So many models I never see b4,btohqsg
Forester solid last time my Cooper s been eaten alive in aye lol,btohqsg
The Honda Nbox is the best selling K-Car in Japan.Quite expensive hereClose 93-98k last year.😅,btohqsg
haha subaru actually very safe one i think they like japanese volvos tbh safety ratings alw high,btohqsg
but can subaru last as long as volvo? volvo 1 engine 1mil km. subaru 100k 1 engine?,btohqsg
jimny is quite a good car if you travel to msia thailand alot but in sg abit weird,btohqsg
no I was tempted to buy one but decided against it,btohqsg
cause not family friendly enough T_T,btohqsg
HAHA agreed. its abit too small for a family but for couples should be just right,btohqsg
the rear and front seat can fold down all the way leh😉😉,btohqsg
ya  I think it's a good enough esp. if you have a doggo and maybe 1 kid!,btohqsg
Yeah. I drove Toyota Sienta before.Got IKEA and fit in a 2metre curtain track 😍In Taiwan  they fit in a 125cc scooter😂👍,btohqsg
Anyone knows where to get platform(?- not sure what it is called) to cover this? So can put some stuffs on top,btohqsg
When you brake hard. The stuff will fly infront😁Must pull up the headrest or bungy cot,btohqsg
Need to look for your car specifically  called a load cover or retractable parcel shelf,btohqsg
Must be sub 4 metre iirc,btohqsg
To prevent the cargo from fly infront.   It quite soft. Put any weight on it . Will bend，not stable,btohqsg
Also for security in case you want to keep what's in your boot hidden,btohqsg
Usually u can't put heavy items on top leh  usually just cover for privacy nia,btohqsg
Here is a mixed of all car owners and enthusiast. Car lovers. Petrol head. I don’t own Euro car.,btohqsg
Contradictory of what I own  but I like 90s JDMs,btohqsg
I like euro cars with Asian cars reliability. is there such a thing in market?,btohqsg
lexus is japanese what is that logic lol,btohqsg
not really  they're still rebranded nissans and hondas just like scion,btohqsg
infinity is Eurasian . Nissan cross renault🤣,btohqsg
"I do like their imposing front though. shouting look "" I am luxury car"".!!",btohqsg
seems like no pure euro car with great reliability in the motor world,btohqsg
reliability is definitely good  solid merc engine,btohqsg
it has inherited the worse part of nissan - heavy weight,btohqsg
Kei cars refer to automobiles with a size of 3.4 m in length  1.48 m in width  and 2 m in height or less  respectively  and a displacement of 0.66 liter or less,btohqsg
Not sure how sienta can qualify,btohqsg
those kallang car park race cars like purple honda civics right,btohqsg
"yeah this has been what i wanted to say. why cant they do that. this owuld sound ""complete"" and perfect",btohqsg
90s JDM now only left the tiong chia,btohqsg
although got exception like the old miatas,btohqsg
so you do recognize euro cars are less reliable compared with Japanese right. that is what i have been saying. 😉 that started the heated debate yesterday,btohqsg
why they dont allow kallang car races anymore? would like to see turbos pitt against each other,btohqsg
There's still a few private gymkhana events that are held,btohqsg
i saw this video last time. old volvos are incredibly reliable. the same cannot be said for the newer ones. for example  my friend had his 7-year old suv dct gerbox repaired 3 times.,btohqsg
it was a ford gb.. now that volvo is part of geely  it is back to being reliable,btohqsg
the biggest difference i noticed under geely is the marked improvement in styling. the exterior styling is very appealing. significantly better looking than old brick coffin lookin g volvos.you dotn repair CT gerbox 3 times  despite 7 year old car. it onoy has 170k km,btohqsg
