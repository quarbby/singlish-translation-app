Sti so green yet all stagnant mkt. Waste time xia,btohqsg
In short summary OXLEY Oxley (OHL SP)Maintain BUY with new TP of SGD0.27 from SGD0.29  23% upside and c.6% yield. Management is focusing on completing its projects to ensure continuous cash flow. Its construction projects were disrupted by COVID19 and delayed by 4-6 months in Singapore  Ireland and Malaysia due to global lockdowns. It was also impacted by fair value revaluation losses due to lower asset prices. As such  we cut our RNAV to SGD0.54  resulting in the lower TP.,btohqsg
