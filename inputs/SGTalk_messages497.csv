You did the right thing  that matters more because you have your values and principles.It's ok that the people you helped don't show appreciation  they might be hurting more than you are.Just let it go and know that He sees.,btohqsg
If u did out of your own willingness  then u shouldn‚Äôt even complain. This mindset is also wrong. Can i say u self entitled too in some way?,btohqsg
The person already say thanks mah. So are u expecting more? The thinking also not right,btohqsg

One more month  my sis is coming back for cny with us,btohqsg
"""Warm"" being 12 degrees in the day. Lol.",btohqsg
The Brits complain anything above 21 is a heat wave,btohqsg
Sadly i dont take those vit c tablets anymore,btohqsg
I tell them 18 degrees with aircon max power in SG is considered cold they stun.,btohqsg
i love standing outside...wind howls...lol i realised i do that when i am overseas...i am crazy,btohqsg
I love it now in winter time when it's cold enough and there's a breeze enough sometimes to really make my long coat flow.,btohqsg
i was telling my niece...how nice we can wear long coats etc...fashion statement...in sg  people will look at you as if you are siao,btohqsg
One orange vit c is not enough...actually guava has the highest concentration of vit c,btohqsg
