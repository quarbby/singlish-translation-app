Yupi uk pattern can use calculator,btohqsg
Can find eqn with quadratic and linear,btohqsg
I j lazy to give full name,btohqsg
And always press 2 or 3,btohqsg
Ok let's say you press 2,btohqsg
Your X column is your term like 1 2 3 4 5 ...,btohqsg
Your y column is your value of term 1,btohqsg
And press either 1 or 2,btohqsg
The coefficient of A and B is your pattern formula,btohqsg
But sometimes it don't work so you must try mode 2 3,btohqsg
Cuz in o lvl got 3 type of pattern formula,btohqsg
Its easy to pass but its difficult to score,btohqsg
But you realised it now ah,btohqsg
I know calculator can find mean and SD but i lazy config,btohqsg

But jae they can accept more,btohqsg
Cos ppl were saying np didnt accept many eae applications,btohqsg
Our sch got 45 eae offers,btohqsg

Oops I actually haven’t rlly revise a math a lot,btohqsg
So i can get A1 again,btohqsg
A math can die in a fire for me,btohqsg
But jc math prob also interesting,btohqsg
But you still scored A1 for it right,btohqsg
Even though I did the2008-2017papers for o levels,btohqsg
I'll share my end product later,btohqsg
I tried the 2021 o level specimen paper for fun,btohqsg
My year got specimen paper for chem prwct,btohqsg
U said u do 2008 to 2017 papers,btohqsg
Heres my mind breaking down at 1.20am,btohqsg
I taking o levels this yea r,btohqsg
Mw your pure chem got emission spectrum ah,btohqsg
I scored low for that paper,btohqsg
@chemceryo for ur o level emath last year whats ur estimated score?,btohqsg
One section b question 4 pages of info,btohqsg
The maris Stella was quite hard though in my opinion,btohqsg
Ok why tf am i not studying,btohqsg

But i need to see mw noodle,btohqsg
The real world context is hard,btohqsg

Anyway I don’t like a math a lot,btohqsg
I btr do 4 more papers i gg to o lvl lor,btohqsg
Cos I thought got out of syallbis stuff,btohqsg
U know when I walk past,btohqsg
Aite anyway why am I here,btohqsg
Idk why I didn’t opt for ip,btohqsg
And organic chemistry in sec 2,btohqsg
And they force to do triple science,btohqsg
I learned this in sec 2 tbh,btohqsg
I learn in sec 3 haha,btohqsg
I’ve been sleeping at 4 am the past 2 weeks,btohqsg
U shld change ur sleep cycle,btohqsg

Before chinese paper it was so scary,btohqsg
I am too nervous yet too relax,btohqsg
I only have like 7-8 that actually vc and study with my at night,btohqsg
I wonder how it like on mon,btohqsg
Yo guys just curious for ur opinions here. Yall think if i take a&e math in 2021 i can double A1 for both anot? Took emath in 2019 and got an A2 but never took amath back in sec sch. Currently in poly and i have adjusted my schedule such that i can commit to it. Covered some topics in amath alr as im currently in pfp and above avg standard for math? But am not sure if taking both is feasible because technically only amath useful for me? What do yall think?,btohqsg
Should I eat it with ice cream lmao,btohqsg
Personally i feel amath easier to A1 than emath,btohqsg
If ur confident  go for it,btohqsg
Plus 2021 theyre removing more topics,btohqsg
The thing about emath is even tho i rusty right but i practiced alot last yr so i still rmb,btohqsg
Why u flex ur steak hahaha,btohqsg
I choosing the 4047 syllabus tho,btohqsg
Alpha beta is easy but yes modulus shld go,btohqsg
Emarh is a lot of understanding,btohqsg
Log expo and power graphs too,btohqsg
But one of my prelim papers if I rmb go be damn mean,btohqsg
I taking it rather than the new syllabus,btohqsg
Need expand the entire thing cause I never memorise,btohqsg
That one is legit just memorise,btohqsg
I just dk eh cuz what if i retake emath then A2 again then i spend lesser time for amath,btohqsg
My prelim question also quite hard this year,btohqsg
They ask prove the value of beta or smthing,btohqsg
Just curious  why u want retake o level ah,btohqsg
Bc poly math not in depth to prepare for higher level math,btohqsg
And i see no harm taking it,btohqsg
They need u to get cert?,btohqsg
Cos if u ask me  I don't really see a point to retake unless necessary  like can self learn also,btohqsg
Nope but i actly have been thinking of it for a few months and looking through the syllabus and how it is taught in poly style,btohqsg
Or I mean like since u aler learning might as well take,btohqsg
For first year sem 1 i mean,btohqsg
But will what u learn in Amarh be applicable to ur poly tho,btohqsg
Cos I rmb there's some quite obsecure stuff,btohqsg
Just trigo and differentiation it doesnt even touch on integration,btohqsg
And the exam questions they put out is damn simple,btohqsg
So ure taking o level amath to prep for poly mathM,btohqsg
Ultimately ur decision bah  but if I'm i wouldnt,btohqsg
Cos I have to put myself thru an exam,btohqsg
And the entire syllabus and all,btohqsg
Waste time only for me I think,btohqsg
When ur poly doesn't need all,btohqsg
Maybe just self learn those chapter that u need,btohqsg
Have linear algebra induction vectors 1st 2nd order DE,btohqsg
The y1 math just too cmi imo,btohqsg
Bc even i realise like alot is just touch and go walao eh,btohqsg
True eh but the prelim papers,btohqsg
There are many free math coueses,btohqsg
I mean got alot lah haha i only know of khan academy organic chem tutor and all that,btohqsg
I mean i havent register for the exam so i can still considee,btohqsg
All taught by professor in university,btohqsg
Why you gotta tempt me at this hour,btohqsg
I actually having quarter life crisis now,btohqsg
You btr be jealous of my bbt right thr,btohqsg
I thought I did decent tho,btohqsg
I can smell your noodle in je,btohqsg

But if it is too hard to understand then i will leave it and explore others,btohqsg
I went to look at it also,btohqsg
And u v certain it's gonna be aerospace engineering den u accept the eae issit?,btohqsg
Cuz jet fighter kinda excites me,btohqsg
Update me two years later and let me know how is poly,btohqsg
Whether u still have the strong passion like today,btohqsg
You can choose avionics or mechanical,btohqsg
I have no physics back ground,btohqsg
Avionics are more to like bearings and fiddling with plane buttons,btohqsg
Mechanical is more like the engine,btohqsg
So u want to fix the plane and all but not pilot?,btohqsg
Do u want to be pilot,btohqsg
They are ur most valuable asset,btohqsg
I have a senior who took optometry,btohqsg
She learn everything about the eyes,btohqsg
