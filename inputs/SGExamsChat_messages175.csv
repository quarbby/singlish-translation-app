what‚Äôs the possible grade for 60+ %,btohqsg
Wuts the estimated A1 value ah,btohqsg
probably going to be like 80% or smth,btohqsg
My maximum mark only abt 93 sia,btohqsg
I fked up prwc so badly,btohqsg
I forgot to read the fking qn,btohqsg
Dont worry get 4/10 better than nothing,btohqsg
idk lolol basically screwed up because my paper one was pretty okay but like paper 2 :‚Äù))))),btohqsg
yes 50/90 is 100% pass don't worry it is weird if they fail,btohqsg
Matrices never time 5 one year 48week,btohqsg
70/90 for paper2 then paper 1 60/80 possible b3?,btohqsg
I think A2 is a higher chance for that score to be honest,btohqsg
My paper today max i minus 20-25mark,btohqsg
I max lost 14 or 16 marks for e math still A2 only so yes,btohqsg
Those that get A1 for E math is the real deal type beat,btohqsg
I just marked the emath paper. Everyone passed,btohqsg
Ok go sleep good luck for next paper,btohqsg
Why whats up with ur matrices,btohqsg
What is up with your mateicg,btohqsg
The matrices they say its for 1 week,btohqsg
So no need multiply 5 what,btohqsg
MY PART E I NVR TIMES 5 SIA,btohqsg
My f I got like 40% but I lazy to redo,btohqsg
the part c is only for a day,btohqsg
pretty sure one mark qn no method mark,btohqsg
i want to score for prwc,btohqsg
And if no half nark then 0.05marks,btohqsg
Yea this paper had so many traps,btohqsg
they made us lower our damn guard in p1,btohqsg
ABC 90 angle in semicircleABO is x isosceles triangle90-x,btohqsg
Everyone think paper 2 damn easy,btohqsg
At this point im just relying on my paper 1üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Ya but isnt it 90degree minus x,btohqsg
someone in this grp messed up paper 1 but got full marks for paper 2,btohqsg
They say leave in x hmm,btohqsg
Thts bcos she drank her juice man,btohqsg
don‚Äôt worry u learn from ur mistakes,btohqsg
This one I never put bracket shd b ok rt,btohqsg
i put it j in case the cher stupid to think 2 isnt for the angle,btohqsg
U open the bracket for (2x)¬∞ u get 2x¬∞,btohqsg
my matrices and bearings lost 4 marks le,btohqsg
My cone one lose 4 marks,btohqsg
My matrix I think all wrong I got like 40 point something %,btohqsg
Matrix i lose mark circle also and last question wrong,btohqsg
i think i can get ecf,btohqsg
the only trap that caught me was in the fkn matrices,btohqsg
use acute angle instead of obtuse angle,btohqsg
I got trapped by the mouse trap that was placed infront of my rable,btohqsg
I reached out for my curve ruler n got my finger trapped by the mouse trap,btohqsg
i got stabbed by a little pin on my finger,btohqsg
my finger got stuck in a french curve once,btohqsg
Matrix again sia my prelim my cher go mess up the order of the elementsWas like A is 23 B is 22 C is 24 then next like he go put A is 4 C is 2 then B is 5,btohqsg
so it prolly hurted for the first part of the ppr,btohqsg
The school collapsed but everyone managed to survive so the paper continued,btohqsg
i hate matrices bc of this,btohqsg
My prwc also dk what to say,btohqsg
No. 1 juice supplier on god,btohqsg
its so far off the crowd fav ans,btohqsg
Guys focus on mugging listening comprehension,btohqsg
Lol dont remind me of that,btohqsg
I‚Äôve spent 5 hrs studying lc,btohqsg
I literally wrote assuming the girl spent average lesser than normal student per week,btohqsg
clean it for a few hours,btohqsg
thats like hundreds of msgs ago,btohqsg
LC is like v tricky one their language,btohqsg
We went from discussing math paper to English LC revision tips,btohqsg
do u study ‚Äòhow to listen to british people speaking‚Äô for lc,btohqsg
If not the only mistake is real world and the circle,btohqsg
scarly last part for lc appear a word like pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis,btohqsg
I still cant believe we had to multiply 5 for matrices,btohqsg
aiya dont ponder on it alr,btohqsg
Pray that cos P2 was diff then LC is ez,btohqsg
i hope i can score for p1 eh,btohqsg
yes i fail my prelim lc soz,btohqsg
also isit ok to ask for rough opr,btohqsg
U van bring ur own rough paper,btohqsg
But u can just do notes at the paper nvm one,btohqsg
im scared i miss out key pts or smth,btohqsg
U all havent take lc yet right,btohqsg
Just tell them its rough paper,btohqsg
If so i warn u all,btohqsg
they usu give tho isnt it,btohqsg
English LC is like a rap contest,btohqsg
Tbh if a lot of people got careless for E Math  then shouldn't the bell curve be like not super high,btohqsg
So a1 will still stay at 91/100,btohqsg
Lol saw one guy asking 95% can get A1 or no,btohqsg
guys 100% can get a1? Im rlly worried,btohqsg
I think you can F9 la,btohqsg
Spent 20 years perfecting my craft,btohqsg
Im glad i revised ny ears before lc. My ears were filled with juice!,btohqsg
Now that‚Äôs a full marks student,btohqsg
Lowkey confident just circle and the last question not that confident,btohqsg
Im confident for LC but not for emath,btohqsg
A1 LC and then i can go to a good jc,btohqsg
If lc i full mark maybe got chance c6,btohqsg
But last question is kinda the killer,btohqsg
guys what‚Äôs the percentage for b3 in e math if we use bell curve,btohqsg
Based on my year 2018 and 2019It was Ard 80+ for B3,btohqsg
Time to pin no bell curve,btohqsg
Why cant we just jump over the bell curve?,btohqsg
If bell curve hit us just avoid the bell curve,btohqsg
is it like a school bell,btohqsg
Lowkey prepare so much but screw up everytime,btohqsg
If school bell rings  early ur bell curve is low,btohqsg
Whats over is over. Dc about bell curve. If u had put in effort  u will def get what u deserve.,btohqsg
The bell curve is a straight line at y=0  then at x=100 it shoots up to y=1,btohqsg
Guys how to draw bell curve?,btohqsg
there are literally so many pple that are getting 75+,btohqsg
i used to use it sm,btohqsg
the real qn is how to draw moderation?,btohqsg
Bobian la what done is done,btohqsg
National A1 to B4 % is almost/above 90%,btohqsg

Hello im dumber than u pls,btohqsg
Were you all not at your seniors‚Äô O level results collection,btohqsg
