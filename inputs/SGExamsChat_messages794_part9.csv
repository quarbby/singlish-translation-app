Nvm I think tele got issues displaying the GC ppl are in correctly  now YT’s profile says he’s not in here,btohqsg

It’s just that now I got a lot of time to spare,btohqsg
But if I still do decide to actually pursue a career in teaching I will stay in the a level chat I guess,btohqsg
ooh teaching what subj u gna teach,btohqsg
But since moe requires 2 subjects I might have to do geog,btohqsg
Hopefully I can do sec sch geog + jc econs,btohqsg
I don’t feel like I can teach jc geog well,btohqsg
a level chat most of the questions are Math,btohqsg
randkmdkd is very likely the best in geog here but idk if he wants to become a full time moe geog cher in the future,btohqsg
Doesn’t mean I can’t help when there’s econs qns,btohqsg
We alr have lots of ppl there to help with math,btohqsg

A bit random but since you were born long ago  did you feel that security in schools was much less strict before 9/11,btohqsg
I recall my history teacher who said that in ajc  before 9/11 students could stay overnight in school and no one cared but after that security would chase ppl out,btohqsg
I just realised you would’ve grad from jc the same year 9/11 happened,btohqsg
science labs and school gate are locked,btohqsg
My guess is last time the school gates would’ve been left open the whole time,btohqsg
I cannot tahan my bro’s rudeness towards my parents,btohqsg
Like it is way beyond a normal teenage rebel,btohqsg
My brother literally talks to my parents like they owe him a living lmfao,btohqsg
I just saw how he talked to my dad,btohqsg
He accused my dad of personally attacking him,btohqsg
Say ‘u siding her (my mum) like a lapdog’,btohqsg
then next moment he go hire lawyer sue the daddy for bringing him into this world,btohqsg
"Like idk how many times I've heard him tell my parents ""you go and try lah"" or "" you go through what I go through then say"" or ""my life  not your problem""",btohqsg
To both my dad and mom  and my dad used to be a cop...idk how he allows him to speak this way to him,btohqsg
And you know what's worse  when I was growing up  literally I talk back ..I either get a slap straight to the face or my father threatens to kick me out the house,btohqsg
Now my brother does it and nothing happens,btohqsg
not sure if i remember correctly but my teacher said that the labs used to be open to students anytime but now only if allowed by teachers,btohqsg
"ya and then years went by and the parents tried to ""apologise"" for what they did and the main excuse is that "" last time were young and have no experience in parenting """,btohqsg
