Omg but I rmb seeing someone talking abe metal in gaseous state,btohqsg
But I can't find it haha,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ since when got gaseous metal one,btohqsg
Cuz the textbook dint tell me abt it,btohqsg
Textbook doesn't tell u a lot of things,btohqsg
Den u tell me why can,btohqsg
just heat up the metal enough,btohqsg
You usually only think of metal as the solid state,btohqsg
So if we breathe in metal gas can we increase our iron,btohqsg
If you breathe in metal gas your insides will melt from the heat,btohqsg
You wouldnâ€™t have survived at that temperature,btohqsg
metal gas only exists under certain conditions,btohqsg
Cause the iron gas will solidify in your lungs,btohqsg
You know how hot is it?,btohqsg
Qhat if u trapped it in a gas syringe and cooled it,btohqsg
and most of the time its a few thousand degrees,btohqsg
then you'll get a syringe with iron...?,btohqsg
just replace your metal gas with steam,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ I swear I alw learn sth new from ppl I don't know,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think our skins melt,btohqsg
chem is so much more than a tb,btohqsg
Anyway the textbook kind of says it,btohqsg
It says matter exists in solid liquid gas,btohqsg
So metal exists in solid liquid gas,btohqsg

but is deemed sufficient for ur syllabus,btohqsg
It's up to you if u want to do some real learning,btohqsg
