MGPS means your parents have to downsize to either 2r or 3r  and seems like this scheme bao jiak one,btohqsg
need to discuss with your folks are they okay to wait few years for a new but smaller house,btohqsg
MCPS is very common and no guarantee to get house,btohqsg
can mcps be use if your parents live nearby?,btohqsg
Pps is for couple with kids or preggers wife.Mcps is for ppl who stay near parents,btohqsg
ok thanks. the competiton is deadly hahaha,btohqsg
we must engage only contractor listed in the Directory of Renovation Contractors?,btohqsg
Got the above. Thank you everyone!,btohqsg
you can stack both together as I have asked the others for you,btohqsg
for mgps applicants  either of these can happen:a) get both mgps and public q nums;b) fail mgps and only get public q;c) fail public and only get mgps q; ord) fail both,btohqsg
for the grant can we choose it to deduct only upon key collection?,btohqsg
Plague is a serious bacterial infection that's transmitted primarily by fleas.,btohqsg
Letâ€™s say we have this scenario:Party A is earning $3k/month for more than 12 months and Party B still studying so $0 income. Hence deferred income is non-applicable.GreenQuartz 4RM is about $450k  after less EHG letâ€™s say $50k  means $400k to be paid via cash/CPF + loan.However due to Party A only earning $3k/month  bank/HDB can only loan maybe $175k  which leaves a balance of $225k.Would that mean that you have they have to come up with $225k out of their CPF/bank account otherwise HDB will reject your application?,btohqsg
NICHOLASin 5 years time they will reassess again haha,btohqsg
then u will know the final amount,btohqsg
u just think like 5 years later,btohqsg
how would ur income be like,btohqsg
yes take that your pay remain stagnant till then you'd have to cough up the shortfall,btohqsg
u should estimate generally how ur income will be like by then,btohqsg
In maybe 2-3 years  Party B will also be drawing a salary already. So should be okay to cover. They will reassess again?,btohqsg
alot of things can change in 5 years,btohqsg
yes apply HLE again before key collection,btohqsg
i mean touchwood worst case scenario,btohqsg
Understood. Even if now cannot afford to pay for it but 3-4 years time can  no issue?,btohqsg
i mean u should still save now lor,btohqsg
u cant know for sure ur salary in 5 years,btohqsg
my friend purchased a 5r years ago  they then had made the 5% staggered payment  fast forward  they have spent the money and need to cough up $300k if they want to collect the keys otherwise they have to give up and forfeit the deposit of $20+k,btohqsg
best is to treat it no change to your salary,btohqsg
haha i think just conservative estimate like,btohqsg
then u adjust year to year,btohqsg
haha sad to say my pay has been stagnant all these years while waiting for my house,btohqsg
but of course start saving for this lor,btohqsg
dont just assume hdb will loan the full 90%,btohqsg
please factor in the expenses of reno appliances furniture wedding honeymoon and whatnot,btohqsg
normally loan quantum is 66x of a couple's combined salary,btohqsg
Don't even have cpf ah D:,btohqsg
So first HLE apply after application of BTO? Then second just before key collection?,btohqsg
they are holding a resale have to cough up $300k after the proceeds,btohqsg
first hle u see the shortfall,btohqsg
then u see how much u need make up,btohqsg
first HLE to be done a week before your selection,btohqsg
I once heard a wise man that he takes it that he's loaning the quantum based on half of his salary,btohqsg
then buy a house this cheap lor,btohqsg
If let say sell the resale away for 300k to 400k then use the sales prceed to pay for the bto is it like after or before ah,btohqsg
have to see how old is your resale  is it TOP before or after 2006,btohqsg
as I have mentioned before you can't use the proceeds fully on your next property purchase as there's a limit,btohqsg
If sell to agent ask agent do all the work can at least get a little limit I want ? Or is it good to sell to hdb directly,btohqsg
sell to HDB sure confirm kena low-ball,btohqsg
