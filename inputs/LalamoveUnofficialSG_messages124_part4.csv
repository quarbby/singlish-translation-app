Says for commercial veh above 3meters or wheel clampCar can park fast game?,btohqsg
Some loading bays strictly for lorries only due to their height.,btohqsg
Most llm users are cheapo....trying to get more bangs for the buck...so if the parking fee is expensive or difficult ..its not wise to take...if they send 2 trolley loads and you push twice likely you will loose money instead ...,btohqsg

Basically gambling lor just like trying your luck to park along double yellow lines hoping that collection is smooth,btohqsg
Yo peeps  newbie here. Pumping petrol in Malaysia and paying by cash vs card  how much difference will it make?,btohqsg
I usually would use my Trust card or YouTrip card overseas. I rarely use cash nowadays. But the margin is very small unless you spend a lot.,btohqsg
Lemme guess coz its safer right?,btohqsg
Agreed 100% usually i pump petrol i use youtrip card. But do check the price before you pay using card. Sometime not tally the price at the pump and counter.,btohqsg
Not exactly safer per se. But it‚Äôs because of the difference in $ and cents when I use card. Even at 3/4 tank also I notice I can save about $25/week if I were to use card payments. üòÖ,btohqsg
For me it‚Äôs between YouTrip or Trust card. The rates are almost close. Maybe about 0.1 difference between the 2 cards. üòÇ,btohqsg
Uh i see. i use card so i know what i spend. üòÇ If use cash  pay this pay that till dont know what i buy. üòÇ,btohqsg
Guys me and someone get the same order.. now we both at restaurant,btohqsg
Usually first one there get to take the order üòÉ,btohqsg
He was here first but his one just gt cancelled üôÇ,btohqsg
He was probably quite late for pick up and the order got reassigned.,btohqsg
The restaurant will just use the cheaper one (if they booked one bike one car)  or randomly cancel one. They double book to ensure they get one. The cancelled rider can try to claim cancellation if he followed SOP.,btohqsg
It's a common practice for some restaurants  so you can avoid these resturants' orders if you want to protest the practice. If not  be prepared to get cancelled occasionally.,btohqsg
