Thank you for the advice! Okay  can start looking out for SBF already. Haha,btohqsg
Would like to ask if anyone has a rough idea of how much HDB loan will one get with a salary of $3K  no car  credit etc?single income..thanks in advance,btohqsg
Usually you can use the hdb calculator  but its being updated to include the new measures  so for now can use normal mortage calculators  there are loads of options  can put 3% to estimate,btohqsg
Np! Pls note that its just an estimate  best is to use HDB's calculator if you want to take hdb loan,btohqsg
Been trying for SBF this year but it look there‚Äôs miserable choices & very limited chance for a 3rm.,btohqsg
Thanks for the advise but I prefer brand new flat & cos that will b my 2nd new flat meaning I got to take the 40k levy into consideration as part of the budget .. make it harder for me.,btohqsg
Correct  if I‚Äôm not wrong $40k that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt get a unit which cost out of my budget as I may not be able to fetch a good price for my current 4rm.,btohqsg
Hi. I have a question  if i gotten a good bto number but still interested to look at sbf in nov. Do i need to give up my bto to apply for sbf?,btohqsg
Nope. You can keep applying for bto/sbf up until you select a flat  at which point they will cancel all other applications for you,btohqsg
if i decide to let go of my May Ballot and proceed with Aug Ballot. must i call HDB and inform them?,btohqsg
Pray hard that there are ppl in front giving up their appt,btohqsg
You mean you got Nov 2021 ballot to go and select a flat in May 2022 ??,btohqsg
I got a queue no for nov 2021 and went ahead to apply for may 2022 bto.. i got invited to select a flat under nov 2021 tengah bto and hdb cancelled my may 2022 bto application..,btohqsg
The reason why i applied for may 2022 bto was because my nov 2021 bto queue no is 417 out of 409 available units.. and i do not know when i can get to select my flat,btohqsg
Yup I‚Äôm just wondering that Nov 2021 you get a queue number and only can go and select a flat only six months later ! Pretty long t√Æme,btohqsg
Yeah‚Ä¶ i applied for nov 2021 tengah bto.. in fact i only waited for ard 4 months as the selection exercise only started somewhere on feb 2022,btohqsg
Thought all selections start two/ three weeks after bto ballot results are out .,btohqsg
And my queue no was out of supply‚Ä¶ selection for those queue no of supply only started on 27 jun‚Ä¶ and im the first few to go select,btohqsg
This is the email that i received from hdb,btohqsg
So for the Aug 2022 bto   selection starts when   do you know ?,btohqsg
If im not wrong it will start on nov 2022‚Ä¶ this is according to one of my friend who applied for the aug 2022 bto,btohqsg
What I know oso is on nov 2022,btohqsg
No it depends project to project,btohqsg

Hello guys  what are the chances if our queue number is slightly above the available supply units? Say just +10 more? Still possible to get units be it low floor etc etc?,btohqsg
Just see the drop out rate,btohqsg

Hi there  would like to ask if anyone knows how the queue # for mgps works i.e Is the queue # separated by unit type 2rm/4rm  2rm/5rm etc. or all of the mgps applicants regardless of unit type?,btohqsg
One more qns on mgps: If our queue# falls out of the # of pre-allocated units by around 5  will the chances of getting a child flat be very low?,btohqsg
Mgps is confirmed can book a flat,btohqsg
ABOUT GRO/MGPS/PUBLIC QUEUESüè†Grassroots Organisation (GRO) Scheme queueThis is a priority scheme reserved for grassroots leaders who have served for at least 3 years. There is not much information from a government source that is publicly available (other thanthis)  but the GRO queue always goes first in a selection. It's not all dandy though - they only can select from a list of preselected units.Additional info:¬ª The GRO queue starts from Q0001.üè† Multi-Generation Priority Scheme (MGPS) queue(s)Applicants of this scheme select a 2-room flat or larger  together with their parents who select a 2-room or 3-room flat. The MGPS queue starts after the GRO queue ends  with 2+x going first  followed by 3+x. Similar to GRO scheme applicants  MGPS applicants are also limited by a preselected list of units. You may read more about the MGPShere.Additional info:¬ª The parents' flat type determines which queue an MGPS application is under  e.g. if parents chose 3-room  the application will be under the 3+x queue.¬ª The 2+x queue comprises (2+2)  2+3  2+4  and 2+5  while the 3+x queue comprises (3+2)  3+3  3+4  3+5.¬ª The configurations in brackets are technically possible  though rare.About MGPS queue numbers:¬ª Each queue (2+x and 3+x) is independent of each other  i.e. the first of each queue can be Q0001 though not necessarily.¬ªTo be more precise  the MGPS queue numbers start from the last GRO queue number of the parent flat typeplus any 2+2 (for 2R)  or 2+3 or 3+3 pairs (for 3R). For example  if there are 5 3R GRO  1 MGPS 2+3 pair and 2 MGPS 3+3 pairs  then the MGPS 3+x queue will start from Q0009.üè† Public QueueThis is everything else! After the GRO and MGPS selections are over  all untaken units are now 'free for all'. You usually can tell when public queue has started when the units taken start to make 'more sense' (e.g. top floors of a 'better' stack going first). Alternatively  for those who have already gotten your appointment dates  you can also 'confirm' this by logging into the HDB portal  clicking on your application registration number  and seeing if you can view thelast queue number of the day. If you can  public queue has started.Additional info:¬ª All priority schemes other than GRO or MGPS will fall under the public queue  e.g. PPS  MCPS.¬ª If there are 10 4R GRO applicants  and 20 4R MGPS applicants  the first number in the 4R public queue will be Q0031.__The above is information that I (@smchua) have put together from having been watching BTO selections for a while. Though said  as I'm not a HDB spokesperson  please do take what I say with a pinch of salt as these are merely my observations; they are not definitively factual.,btohqsg
Thank you very much for the enlightenmentüòÉSince there isn‚Äôt much out there I could find on the mgps,btohqsg
Where do i go to see this?,btohqsg
When the price everything  came out and if u have the q,btohqsg
I have a queue number  but i log into hdb page i don't see anything. Is it too early?,btohqsg
It might not be out yet  but it'll be the page where you can see all the project details like the site plan  number of available flats etc. The prices will be at the bottom of the page  right now it may be just the range of prices shown,btohqsg
I see  thanks so much for explaining!,btohqsg
Anyone got their appt date for choosing unit on nov for sunsail at sembawang?,btohqsg
