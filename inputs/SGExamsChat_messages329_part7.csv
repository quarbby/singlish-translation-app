I did help an ex student score perfect GPA for one of the poly semesters.Though only one,btohqsg
i calculated one of my postgrad courses,btohqsg
if i got 3.4 for any sem in uni i am toast,btohqsg
that can happen in poly also mah,btohqsg
in jc ct score a bit toilet paper,btohqsg
if u put it that way,btohqsg
Just putting it out here shamelessly haha,btohqsg
true but the course that u do is prob something that u wish to go to and u enjoy doing that ah (provided u get in ofc),btohqsg
poly itself isn't any easier per say,btohqsg
because you basically cram entire modules within 6 months or so w/9 consistent-ish effort you also won't get anywhere,btohqsg
tbh regardless if you go jc / poly there isn't exactly a huge difference in the amount of effort you put in consistently,btohqsg
just that for poly your subjects change every 6 mths and you have a slightly more slack timetable,btohqsg
i think an avg performing jc student has a real chance of getting into local uni compared to avg performing poly student,btohqsg
In poly more external factors will affect your GPA than it is for Rank points  i.e. luck in getting into a decent project group for every module. Bad teammates are incredibly a huge liability,btohqsg
Depends on major. I entered uni with 3.5.,btohqsg
Got no magic bullet answer to whether you should go JC or poly. There's a lot of factors that can contribute to the final outcome e.g. whether you need the major  your learning style  the major you want to enter  whether the major requires strong portfolio or additional requirement  whether you want to work first then get the degree due to reasons like financial issues or work exposure/experimentation  etc etc etc,btohqsg
What I can definitely say is now  compared to last time  there's many ways to upgrade your education like WSDip  WSDegree  and soon there will be WS for postgrads. Back then if you can't enter uni then your road is just gonna lead straight to the workforce until retirement.,btohqsg
i mean i entered uni with 3.23 LOL,btohqsg
definitely not easier to score.That's why it's tougher to get into uni through poly  on top of the myriad of other factors already mentioned.,btohqsg
Think I wasn't clear.JC isn't an easy route  it's stressful  it's a lot of work.But to think poly is easier is wrong too. Poly can be harder. It's easier if u want a cert to graduate with and start work. Not many wants to hire someone with just A level cert  but many want to hire with poly certs.But if u want to play the higher game and go into uni  many factors are against you. It's harder to score well consistently due to GPA requirements  and the quota to enter uni is lower.,btohqsg
that one surefire way to not fet uni alr piao,btohqsg
is there even any course that accepts ddd/d,btohqsg
theres no way u can cram lmao,btohqsg
sure but like i havent met a single person who managed to cram everyth in time or cram and scored well across his subjects,btohqsg
got one guy he crammed history all the way,btohqsg
quite solid but come out only a B,btohqsg
which i mean its nice but he didnt have time to cram the other subjects and ended up scoring D,btohqsg
ik a few (although it's v difficult),btohqsg
i mean he got where he wanted la but still if ur course is like 75>rp,btohqsg
but as a figure of speech it's possible to cram for jc while cannot do that for poly side,btohqsg
my strategy for busy JC 1 students for now is to focus heavily on 2 H2 subjects while coasting along for the 3rd one.Focus is the ultimate weapon.Dec of J1 is to focus on that 3rd one.Of course  if can do well in all  by all means go full steam ahead. Don't be limited by what I say.,btohqsg
My school idea is to get confidence in a 70 and immediately move on I think,btohqsg
So go JC meaning the 2 years is vigorous do or die type?,btohqsg
It's not even 2 years. You actually only have 20 months to really prep for A level.,btohqsg
it starts slowly and pace builds up by mid J1,btohqsg
Graduate from NUS/NTU vs SIT the starting pay are different?,btohqsg
Worth to do DSA JC by a Sports?,btohqsg
The Sports would it kill me since need to juggle A Level works?,btohqsg
It might. It might not.Some only start shining in JC. Tough to say,btohqsg
Heard some JC's retain many in JC1,btohqsg
NUS want enter this one need AAA/A,btohqsg
In this case  just select a JC near my place if to do A Level?,btohqsg
"Just work hard.But ""work hard"" means different things to different people",btohqsg
End of the day Elite JC  Neighbourhood JC all take the same A Level papers,btohqsg
I stay in hougang and chose JC in Buona Vista last time ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
peer pressure and peer support different,btohqsg
Near home mean have more time to Z.zzzz,btohqsg
i studied on my hour+ bus ride home,btohqsg
Sadly so many JC's being merged!,btohqsg
imagine do that for 300 days over 2 years  that's 300 hours more.,btohqsg
