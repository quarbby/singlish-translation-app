Hi. May I ask if let say I made a fixed time deposit of 12 months in Ocbc  after 12 months when this money goes back to my Ocbc 360 account  will I still be able to continue to earn the interest based on my Ocbc 360 account interest?,btohqsg
Any way to add payee to GXS without need to key bank account number every time when doing transfer to other banks?,btohqsg

Can i check if i deposited $75k into my gxs acc  the daily interest will be $7.15 everyday?,btohqsg
Or is it cos the interest for $7.15 is too little to reflect on the next day thats y by 2nd day interest is still $7.15?,btohqsg
Posted around 1230-1235am every day for interest earned on previous day.,btohqsg
You need at least accumulate $105 of interest to earn additional $0.01 of daily interest from interest.,btohqsg
Maybe reach $75050 and above n if GXS do rounding  then you will see $7.16.,btohqsg
Not me  and I applied in month of June,btohqsg
Anyone knows for interbank GIRO. Do they deduct on the specific credit card due date or earlier ?Eg if Citibank CC due on 7th Aug and the interbank giro is HSBC EGA,btohqsg
Actually I think my Citibank Due Date is 22th  but got charged to my EGA on 20th.AMEX one charges even earlier. Due date is 13 Aug  direct debit date is 2nd Aug,btohqsg
So this one can take out and deposit anytime and they will take end of day balance for each day?,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/I2yVSQhL8sIA full video on moomoo 5.8% will be posted later this month,btohqsg

Can withdraw   but best to just keep it for max return,btohqsg
For tour group booking  what’s the best card for cashback or miles? Thanks,btohqsg
Which travel agency? Some agencies outside looks using travel mcc code  but inside when tapping/paying your card  they use other non qualified mcc code.,btohqsg
It depends on the bank. I know uob debits one day early  dbs is on due date,btohqsg
There is DP said ASA and Hong Thai mcc code is 7991  not qualified under Travel category.Good luck to you.Best is to use DBS chatbot method to confirm mcc code if you intended to earn more  miles from tour booking.,btohqsg
Thanks for ur info! Would Citi premiermiles be more straightforward then?,btohqsg
Less miles. How much you plan to spend?,btohqsg
Any idea which miles card is good for 10k swiping at Chan brothers? Can't find any with a high monthly cap.,btohqsg
