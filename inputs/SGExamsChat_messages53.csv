People like to view Bedok I guess,btohqsg
hey remember when someone in the group said you cant get shortlisted for any nus interview if you don‚Äôt get 90,btohqsg
Nah that  person kept saying you can‚Äôt,btohqsg
That you cant even get shortlisted,btohqsg
It sounds like you‚Äôre the one who said it,btohqsg
But this yr even 88.75 got shortlisted,btohqsg
You mean for scholarship or to enter the course,btohqsg
Whats the requirement for gms nus cs,btohqsg
But what else should i try to do if i wanna get gms,btohqsg
i wont advise u further on this,btohqsg
Hes prolly jerking off to eqns,btohqsg
Now that I see macs stopping takeaway orders,btohqsg
I was craving 1-4-1 canadian pizza,btohqsg
Until i saw i alr overate by 600 cal,btohqsg
I will never be able to diet,btohqsg
Food is one of the ways I cope,btohqsg
Good that you can ckntrol lol,btohqsg
It used to be the same for me,btohqsg
Is it that cathartic to build stuff in Minecraft?,btohqsg
I've never been a builder so,btohqsg
But its fun to do it w ppl,btohqsg
I wanted to join the sgexams discord Mc server today but nobody was on it at that time,btohqsg
Oh well I probably won't know anyone there,btohqsg
Yeh no mate no one is,btohqsg
You can always be the change you want to see in the world,btohqsg
U wanna see the world burn,btohqsg
U better test that flammable equiment on urself first,btohqsg
Assisting in suicide is a crime,btohqsg
Now you can argue with higher beings,btohqsg
While the weight of existence weighs upon you,btohqsg
Message from Shawn Shawn deleted. Reason: external link(?),btohqsg
Bad morning to all of you,btohqsg

Shld make a good afternoon and good evening one,btohqsg
Daily high of 942 new COVID-19 cases reported in Singaporehttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-new-cases-singapore-942-apr-18-dormitories-12655240,btohqsg
The day haven‚Äôt over why so fast annouce,btohqsg
Because scared ltr rise again is it,btohqsg
Each day‚Äôs cases is from yesterday‚Äôs 12 PM to today‚Äôs 12 PM,btohqsg
Well didnt we alr overtake malaysia in total cases,btohqsg
Tbh idk what is good news or bad news anymore,btohqsg
We blundered the foriegn workers dormitories quite badly though,btohqsg
Idk if its even called a blunder anymore,btohqsg
more like a slowly burning trail that finally reached the powder keg,btohqsg
bad year to be manpower üíÄ,btohqsg
/shrugcivil activism was never our strong suit,btohqsg
and there's no political pressure for better working conditions for foreign workers,btohqsg
/shrugapathy is the main mindset of singaporeans,btohqsg
apathy would be saying that then saying oh so what does it matter,btohqsg
either way it's a major fuck up,btohqsg
but at least once a fuck up happens they tend to fix it,btohqsg
rather than leave the fuck up to fuck up even more,btohqsg
they're people with families too  what makes them less important than us,btohqsg
they're not less important but but there's no one to pressure the government to do anything beyond VWOs/civil society groups on their behalf,btohqsg
i feel the framing of the issue is kinda problematic also,btohqsg
and if anything government would probably side w/ employers because they don't want to drive up local costs,btohqsg
these few days the headlines always put ‚Äúmajority fw dorm cases‚Äù,btohqsg
did you read one ms han‚Äôs op ed in washington post,btohqsg
she published an op ed in the washington post?,btohqsg
let me skim it really quick,btohqsg
i think it was front page r sg,btohqsg
i don't disagree with what she says,btohqsg
hope that once the situation has been dealt with they convene something to investigate/legislate towards better working conditions,btohqsg
yea agree with her on this too,btohqsg
just went on r/sg  saw some neckbeard claiming female pedopilia will not get charged in singapore cuz 'gender equality',btohqsg
Was not going to be a cesspool,btohqsg
SGExams is the gold standard of internet group chats,btohqsg
Don't think so. It is an active greed that drives it,btohqsg
"It's not ""I don't care you die""",btohqsg
"It is ""if you die  give me your shit""",btohqsg
Can't call it a fuck up if it is planned,btohqsg
Why do so many people think the govt fked up lol,btohqsg
The high-paying JP Morgan jobs SG wants built off the backs of low wage dorm workers allowed this,btohqsg
Why the fk is anyone surprised,btohqsg
If you spam pikakek to act surprised I am fine but pls don't be surprised poor people are dying and getting hit the hardest in crises,btohqsg
just disappointed to have it reinforced,btohqsg
that a lot ppl deem poor people as less worthy,btohqsg
The problem comes when you ask people to give anything up for the poor,btohqsg
Why do you think people complain when taxes are raised,btohqsg
I feel like they might extend for BMT because BMT essentially recreates the dormitory environment,btohqsg
Asking for trouble if they continue,btohqsg
wHO RECIEVE MESSAGE FROM THIS PERSON,btohqsg
hE say he from sgexams but i think he hasnt joined the grp yet,btohqsg
It‚Äôs one of those people who have 1 account to scroll through the member list and another account to cold message girls,btohqsg
When u said abduallah i felt that üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
What language pack is this anyway,btohqsg
It has a mean girls reference,btohqsg
Check in with me  and do ya job,btohqsg
I only know the command that blows up people,btohqsg
Yamborghini chain rest in peace to my superior,btohqsg
Hormat suga dada hormat senja ta,btohqsg
Same sia  I just anyhow whack based on pronunciation,btohqsg
We don't use jalan anymore iirc,btohqsg
Yo send him the whole sg anthem,btohqsg

I OOC for like 2 months already  I didn't learn the hormat drills,btohqsg

"""You must do something for me first""",btohqsg
Izok  if I never come back on May 4  cfm OOC,btohqsg
Bullying a man for his poor English,btohqsg
Dafuq are you doing here HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Are shoe stores still open during this period?,btohqsg
I need to get a new pair of running shoes,btohqsg
why tf is mr john smith the owner now,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt look a very interesting show,btohqsg
R u now a broker of online services,btohqsg
U have nsfw pics of your friends,btohqsg
Its actually a pic of u,btohqsg
U can pay me $10 to not release pics of u,btohqsg
this is money heist on john,btohqsg
He has accumulated a fair amount of wealth,btohqsg
Its time to take a portion of it,btohqsg
Cause it looks way too suspicious,btohqsg
To come up w a plan for u,btohqsg
Or u can pay me to manage this grp,btohqsg
hi can Singaporeans take UK‚Äôs A levels?,btohqsg
Ma'am you should ask your country's examination board not us,btohqsg
Sir you just got your pay one week ago,btohqsg
How did you spend all your monies,btohqsg
but why would I wanna do that,btohqsg
No one ask u to do it hahahah,btohqsg
@kiss_mybuttbruh you should‚Äôve just tell him payment before delivery,btohqsg
get him to send you a deposit then ciao,btohqsg
make him go to western union to transfer but give a non-existent account and keep telling him to try again so you can waste his time,btohqsg
Or u can give him my bank account,btohqsg
or make him donate to a charity,btohqsg
Upz  haha but bias coz they stole Elite actors ‚òπÔ∏è,btohqsg
ask him for receipt of the donation then ciao,btohqsg
heres a sticker i have of john,btohqsg
this was taken at ac halloween event,btohqsg
i rmb my pw cher lowkey hinted our grades for my grp,btohqsg
Huh??? GPP is so early in the process,btohqsg
"He was like""Our class is fkin outstanding in PW  but cmi in other subjects""",btohqsg
5 months later  23/25 of us got A,btohqsg
Cos they roughly know our raw scores,btohqsg
The part where u submit WR and ur individual components,btohqsg
Yea I know how PW grading works,btohqsg
Doesnt matter if my sch only had 48 people getting A for H1 GP,btohqsg
Now the real question is if they are the ones who worked for it,btohqsg
Lol pw really is luck sometimes,btohqsg
But it's sweet when the slackers get the B,btohqsg
If u suay suay get external examiner during op,btohqsg
Usually the last grp members to present get the hardest qns,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still proud of being the only 1 A student out of 9 students from my class that is under this shitty teacher. My secret? Get resources from ppl under good teacher ayyy,btohqsg
1 of the examiner was my physics tutor,btohqsg
"I rmb my pw op i got asked""What are aspects of your project work other groups can learn from?""Then the audience all laugh",btohqsg
Consult other tutors got this sticky situation of ‚Äúgo ask your teacher for permission first‚Äù then cue own teacher ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt ask me?‚Äù,btohqsg
I just flamed other grps work,btohqsg
So I just get the resources can Liao,btohqsg
Wow I‚Äôm amazed you got A for being undiplomatic,btohqsg
I rmb 5 of the audience members (they were the same grp) laughing at my answers,btohqsg
4 out of 5 of them got B in the end,btohqsg
I paused like 1min  and gave 4 points,btohqsg
Ok la but must admitPw was fun,btohqsg
Just that the work one has to do is dumb,btohqsg
Pw was never meant to be practical anyway,btohqsg
There‚Äôs another way to approach this  he can just highlight the challenges faced in his project and talk about his innovative workards without flaming,btohqsg
The remaining 3 points were flaming,btohqsg
Carry quite a bit but B,btohqsg
Then 3 people A in the group,btohqsg
Anyways I just tell myself that I dun need the A haha,btohqsg
I still remember my PW OP  first shift  first day  about time  fucking nervous  go to assessment room  -thank my lucky stars internally-  2 assessors  1 my OGCT  1 my CCA IC  I‚Äôm like Wah È©¨Á•®ÈÉΩÊ≤°ÊúâÈÇ£‰πàÂáÜ„ÄÇ,btohqsg
I only remember writing the wr and stuff,btohqsg
My grp was quite op in writing WR,btohqsg
PI was hell  EOM was fun  I&R because there‚Äôs a new development after we finish our WR in the topic we‚Äôre covering  I naturally found an easy I&R to write and it‚Äôs fun.,btohqsg
We maxed out all marking points with 2.5k words,btohqsg
And were forced to increase it to 2.9k,btohqsg
PI was fun with Mrs Toh as your teacher,btohqsg
Tbh looking back at it PW wasn‚Äôt high workload,btohqsg
It is just because that we are so anal that we keep revising drafts,btohqsg
I wrote OP for my group mates instead,btohqsg
Must contribute by playing to your strengths,btohqsg
Big part of PW is redoing things to make it better,btohqsg
My group leader and I did 80% of the WR,btohqsg
PW is the definition of semula,btohqsg
But the other 3 carried OP,btohqsg
I wish Uni research papers worked that way,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs all fair and good,btohqsg
But now looking back at it 1 year is more than sufficient to complete everything,btohqsg
I mean that‚Äôs the point right,btohqsg
??? Uni research is about redoing to make it better,btohqsg
In uni you ‚Äòtechnically‚Äô can rush your essay in 1 week and at some point you just submit it in,btohqsg
Can but ain‚Äôt nobody gonna read a draft like your PW tutors,btohqsg
Can  just that less time is spent on each individual essay,btohqsg
You can get feedback so IDK what this guy is on,btohqsg
Well I Guess I‚Äôm unlucky with my profs then  with the exception of 1  my other ones have only been a research proposal is the Max I‚Äôm reading (aka 1 page outline),btohqsg
You put less emphasis into each essay  I feel,btohqsg
It's probably because it's not their research.,btohqsg
Are you doing your own research or their research,btohqsg
If you need independent verification of your own research,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs their research ofc they will read right bahaha,btohqsg
But honestly if your own supervisor is not reading  then something is wrong already,btohqsg
Anyway IDK what level this is  because undergrad is not grad  grad is not post doc  and post doc fellow is not independent PI,btohqsg
i‚Äôd ask u for permission ur highness,btohqsg
U research  most people won't care,btohqsg
I think the 'hard'-sciences  undergrad research most won't care,btohqsg
isnt that as all the a‚Äôs results,btohqsg
PW is always given separate from the other subjects,btohqsg
wow theres soft and hard science?,btohqsg
Hard Sci got research at Undergrad one ah,btohqsg
Soft science is arts and social sciences,btohqsg
Maybe experimental verification  if done well enough by itself.,btohqsg
then what subject is not science at all,btohqsg
I shall hear no more of this Scipremacist Language,btohqsg
I hope NS gobbles you up whole after quarantine is over,btohqsg
If that happens I‚Äôll take a rest in my chair and enjoy the air con,btohqsg
why do you need to be a phD,btohqsg
The most over qualified security guard,btohqsg
But lol. Masters to be security guard,btohqsg
Next time janitor also need masters,btohqsg
Then a lot of ppl will be out of jobs le,btohqsg
But they specifically mentioned Á°ïÂ£´so masters Lo,btohqsg
oh so it's a general term,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt even have a graduation ceremony,btohqsg
Thing is it‚Äôs a requirement sia,btohqsg
Means even the most Cui person is a masters,btohqsg
I sarpork this so no accidental manufacturing of Chlorine Gas,btohqsg
If you enter SPF with a degree  you can become an inspectror,btohqsg
INSP is a rank  not a position,btohqsg
So u are just qualified not overqualified,btohqsg
Yeah  but it still requires you to be promoted to there,btohqsg
To join SPF as Investigation Officer you can't be 'just a degree holder',btohqsg
To be an inspector  you should have a degree(it's the prerequisite for Direct Entry Inspector),btohqsg
They work somewhere first got something to flex then go apply ma,btohqsg
In western countries plus sg they don‚Äôt really need an advanced degree to do many of the lucrative jobs,btohqsg
Thing is people have a thing against OQ ppl,btohqsg
If u OQ and u can‚Äôt get job else where where you aren‚Äôt OQ,btohqsg
I run a supermarket and some harvard grad come recruit for cashier,btohqsg
I won't cos he has a problem,btohqsg
This some good will hunting stuff,btohqsg
Either he needs to zao soon  or he has something to hide that his previous interviewed companies won't want him,btohqsg
Many HR turn down ppl just based on grade,btohqsg
Some even cos of one grammar error,btohqsg
Why I need some Harvard grad come intimidate the rest of my staff,btohqsg
but if ur working for major mnc,btohqsg
Cashier is unskilled job in that anyone can do without special training. Not that I meant it in a derogatory way,btohqsg
I need think about my team dynamics,btohqsg
If the rest of my staff don't have Harvard degree,btohqsg
Then the Harvard grad come in,btohqsg
Is this some thinly veiled Harvard ad,btohqsg
Why the massive hard on about Harv,btohqsg
Ok let's change to Stanford can,btohqsg
Haven‚Äôt seen this one in a while,btohqsg
Change name regularly  else people think US only Sutanfoodo and Haa-IDK,btohqsg
I won't even give him a chance to prove himself,btohqsg
U know Walmart cashier admission rate is 1%?,btohqsg
I got time to think whether he fit meh,btohqsg
Home team academy is also a good sch in that sense,btohqsg
Honestly HR have very stupid criteria that makes their life easier,btohqsg
Screen ppl by gender/race/gpa/school/num of leadership position/SAT scores,btohqsg
They don't even need tell u why u got rejected,btohqsg
Interesting ppl get rejected at non top places,btohqsg
HR job is to hire ppl the fastest way possible that can fit the job,btohqsg
They don't need to find the best ppl,btohqsg
That's why hr always tell u to apply Early,btohqsg
If u damn zai and apply late,btohqsg
Bruh next PM gonna come from HTA of cuz g00d sch00l,btohqsg
The roles are taken by the ppl who are not the top,btohqsg
Let's just say I have my fair share of rejections ba,btohqsg
Even at places with only 5 ppl,btohqsg
Ya la I apply cui jobs b4 I go uni also ma,btohqsg
Let's just have a bet ba. I go apply for cashier equivalent non skilled jobs after having Blackstone in my CV,btohqsg
See how many firms will want me,btohqsg
Non skilled jobs or low skilled jobs don't want OQ ppl,btohqsg
I tot this one quite obvious sia. I'm quite wrong then,btohqsg
See you can get rejected by ranked 60-70 schools when I can get in top 5,btohqsg
Cos there's something called yield and fit ma,btohqsg
Same thing for jobs sia. Team dynamics is important,btohqsg
Sorry hijack but anyone here posted to changi naval base ah,btohqsg
How can a single person have team dynamics...,btohqsg
99% of grauduates faill this ques,btohqsg
Ok lor then let's compare big 4 with PE,btohqsg
What I'm saying is nontop vs top job,btohqsg
U too fixed into the cashier eg,btohqsg
What I meant was a broader phenomenon on top vs non top jobs,btohqsg
Help la  2.01 KB need 90+s to analyse?,btohqsg
This  just hide the fact u from xxx top school,btohqsg
I gave up on my pc,btohqsg
Sorry never use Mac much didn't notice,btohqsg
My iPad has quite good longevity leh,btohqsg
Only prob is battery I would say,btohqsg
I have been using the pen for 3 years,btohqsg
If u get the latest ver,btohqsg
but like I buy too many tech stuff alr,btohqsg
or is the huawei mate pad good,btohqsg
Erm pro got 4 speakers  120hz refresh rate  better graphics and CPU,btohqsg
cos I alr buy a lot huawei products,btohqsg
120hz refresh is very very prominent,btohqsg
I use on normal iPad with 60hz refresh,btohqsg
When u writing will have writing lag ba,btohqsg
120hz can't detect the writing lag,btohqsg
Get a keyboard then should be fine,btohqsg
I haven't seen my iPad pro lag leh,btohqsg
I am lol if u still need to ask,btohqsg
Hhhh how u see msg from so far up,btohqsg
i open the chat den happen to see lol,btohqsg
Eh apple has its good bouts la,btohqsg
Plus apple best appeal is the ecosystem ma,btohqsg
iPhone iPad Mac Apple watch airpod,btohqsg
Just that I don't like being locked down to apple lor,btohqsg
If somehow apple updates it's product with shit quality,btohqsg
U have no other choice but to suck it up and buy,btohqsg
Whereas for PC if one manufacturer cui then u go to the next one ma,btohqsg
u die alr later the apple fans boys gg kill u,btohqsg
I wanted to buy iphone 11 or 11 pro sia,btohqsg
Then i cannot bring myself to buy iphone anymore,btohqsg
not worth u go see youtubr,btohqsg
is just big battery and 120hz,btohqsg
camera is meh the 100x zoom is gimmick,btohqsg
Don't get S20(I heard the name and I came),btohqsg
then u see her opposite the road,btohqsg
u buy se for the a13 chip oni right,btohqsg
I'm a Samsung fanboy  but it disappointed me a lot recently,btohqsg
And the camera and wireless charging and upgraded connection speeds,btohqsg
For $649 some more  I just get without question (and I hate apple btw),btohqsg
I'm waiting for Note 20 to see if it's good  then trade in,btohqsg
Cuz it might use SD 865+,btohqsg
but apple all 12 mega pixel tho,btohqsg
Note 10 like $1.3k on Samsung website,btohqsg
Their camera is actually reliable unlike S20,btohqsg
I heard s20 pro got focus issues,btohqsg
All the S20 variants got autofocus and heating issues,btohqsg
How much do you get paid per month?,btohqsg
You know they say  if you can't buy it twice  you can't afford it,btohqsg
You could always go for the NS internship  ez $630 per month,btohqsg
Don't buy Note if you don't have at least $2k  cuz you'll need the remainder as fallback money,btohqsg
my internship company pushed back by 2.5 weeks  then they up the pay from 800 to 1k to compensate  but since i'm staying until dec i actually gain more $$ kek,btohqsg
nah i saving for grad trip,btohqsg
ahh yeah i don't know what's the arrangement for mine also  sigh but since i'm staying for such a long time maybe it'll blow over and i can get a proper internship lol,btohqsg
Erm why no one mentioned oneplus 8,btohqsg
Cheaper than samsung  comparable in quality,btohqsg
I think he said it‚Äôs the best android phone up till now,btohqsg
Then u need wait for note 11 or something ba,btohqsg
Which is likely going to be 1.5k,btohqsg
Plus a lot of sociology  philosophy,btohqsg
i cant get into fiction lol,btohqsg
Now I have quite an imagination,btohqsg
But we all are experiencing tbh,btohqsg
funnily enough i haven't experienced any internet related issues,btohqsg
Must be cuz you're using a wifi 6 device,btohqsg
but if it's wifi issues that you're experiencing then it's not the ISP taiji what,btohqsg
My wifi suddenly just cuts out when I'm using and comes back 2 minutes later,btohqsg
i think they're leaving it for ppl to pick up,btohqsg
Yeah I just thought the paper was pretty hilarious,btohqsg
Technically if they were not lazy they would have directly donated the books somewhere  I suppose?,btohqsg
Leaving it at the HDB corridor is the easy way out,btohqsg
