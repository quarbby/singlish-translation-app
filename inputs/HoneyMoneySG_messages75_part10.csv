HiI have a HSBC Revolution Card. It claims to offer 4mpd however I have realised I have been getting only one hsbc point per dollar spent5 HSBC Points converts to 2 milesAny idea what could be going wrong?,btohqsg
10x points (4mpd) for online/contactless spend on a whitelist of MCC. 9x bonus points to be credited by end of next calendar month,btohqsg
It doesn’t shows up in the statement?,btohqsg
Never heard of transfering OA to medisave,btohqsg
I observed it comes in every alternate statement under points adjusted,btohqsg
Oh we can’t? Thanks for sharing,btohqsg

Yes  cannot… only can cash top up.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  quick check  I just opened  HSBC EGA on 18th Nov and need to meet 2k ADB. If i deposit 2k today   do i still meet the 2k ADB? Or need to deposit more cause 18-20 Nov  the balance is 0?,btohqsg
Can't transfer OA to MA at all  only OA-SA.Anyway the preferred method is to VCMA up to the new limit next year from 1 Jan 2024  to maximise tax relief.,btohqsg
Thanks Chris. May I ask what is VCMA,btohqsg

Hi  if i transfer $$ and state salary from my uob to ocbc account. Will ocbc treats it as salary deposit??,btohqsg
No. OCBC 360 very strict.. Salary Credit must be from Corporate Account.. not Personal Account..,btohqsg
I see  how about dbs or stan chart?,btohqsg
I just realised the posted date is 14 Nov and I still didn't see it reflected on 20 Nov. Is it because of foreign spend in hotel causing the delay?,btohqsg
local also slow..my Friday transaction now haven't reflect also,btohqsg
If you're referring to the tracker  yes its slow. Even when posted. If you want to check  you can add up your transactions manually,btohqsg
Hi all does any one use this?https://heymax.ai/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=ads&utm_campaign=lookalike&utm_content=Best+card&fbclid=PAAaYGwpE0ztRMo27kXUVSMZ78vgnxJNaL6gqlq2mF2t1RZRzSb1FYmmYX89k_aem_AeRTGLi6-ZrEftIJjVCjlL3pilywx-a7tQsgL_mKPQtsU-vKobQb-RuMYoJADwGq_pjt3G0ty8vvALnct69_quyk,btohqsg
hi   how to select “ SALARY PAYMENT “under paynow ? i can’t find in posb banking app,btohqsg
First  In my personal experience the disbursement of the  bonus points is extremely late. I applied for the card in early May and until this very day (more than 6 months later)  I have yet to received it. When I call and ask  they just keep repeating the same message that it will be deposited soon.Second  Tried buying a refrigerator at a shop using Google pay linked to the card. And they outright rejected it. When I call. They say didn't know what was wrong at first and bounced me here and there for over an hour. Until they finally give up and blame it on Google Pay.Third  they are not able to sync with 3rd party wallet apps. So hard to use other apps. And they set a limit to use with Google pay. Out of the 2 metal CC I used  it is definitely the worst of the 2 cards and I dare say overall poor service.So do consider it csreful,btohqsg
Hello  just got my hsbc rev card approved. Can I check if buying Amazon vouchers counts towards min spend for singsaver bonus as well as the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Not too sure  but pretty sure it will count if you buy via HeyMax (since it's based on MCC),btohqsg
can SC Bonus$aver salary using UOB fast method?,btohqsg
wah..seems like only UOB is relax with salary crediting terms,btohqsg
how does uob salary tracker look like? can anyone show ?doing for first time,btohqsg
how come my uob app tracker not updated? even pending payment no longer showing.thanks thanks,btohqsg
Only posted transaction will show. It take a few day for tracker to update,btohqsg
read that..spend on cards also require min of 5 transactions..so if 1 shot do a $500 payment..think still must clock 4 more card transaction..,btohqsg
that is for uob one credit card  not uob one account. uob one cc need 5 transaction per statement month and minimum 500 per quarter to get rebate,btohqsg
ar.....ok.....thanks...think i read till blur liao,btohqsg
