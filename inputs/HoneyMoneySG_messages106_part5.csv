IfSQtickets - CNY  assuming you‚Äôre buying one-way originating from China.  I realised that the DCC-ed SGD on SQ website is higher than bank rates. (I did one way back to SG on ex-BKK and ex-CAN last year)As for bonus miles  I believe you still do earn the 3mpd on SQ purchases as they‚Äôre based off description instead of MCC.,btohqsg

How would we know when the fund will increase or decrease,btohqsg
We wouldn‚Äôt know  but I‚Äôm wondering why or when I would see increase decrease,btohqsg
I told you why. When will be when the fund increases or decreases,btohqsg
If You bought something at 1$  today‚Äôs price still 1$. Why would there be an increase or decrease,btohqsg
Monitor from UOB Invest app  I assume the fund was purchased through that app. The dashboard should show the total value. The yield is not guaranteed. I put 10k inside  from Feb to now  only grow 93. My view point is increase may not be consistent and may not hit the 4.7% they advertised. But it is better than saving accounts rate and it is quite liquid.,btohqsg
Hi@samsam  Can I know how to access the Fast transfer feature in DBS app  I dont see any section called fast.,btohqsg
If your creation date is 4th May  your actual purchase date/time is probably 6th May 3pm  which I guess they will actually only buy in on 6th May after 9:30pm. Which may not have any movement from the till your latest NAV update on 7th May.,btohqsg
excluded for citi cashback+ but they talking about Amex True Cashback,btohqsg
I see. Just now I saw there is a pending order showed up. Does this mean I will see movement soon ?,btohqsg
Pending order? You mean they haven't even purchased the funds? The more it won't move...But I may be wrong ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
