but is in july tho  if extend one month then end of may only,btohqsg
Unless they wanna do online exam like uni,btohqsg
still got june hopefully can buffer,btohqsg
cannot sia my friend spin the wheel to answer mcq for uni test,btohqsg
Uni online exam is in a mess,btohqsg
Maybe got confused with the myes,btohqsg
I bet alot of ppl googled,btohqsg
my friend say got people live stream the test on discord somemore,btohqsg
JC doesnâ€™t have any June exams either,btohqsg
if 700+ we hitting 4K cases,btohqsg
JC MYEs are technically not postponed HAHA,btohqsg
It became a 'class test' instead,btohqsg
my teachers say jc if mye cancelled then they give you the paper as practice paper,btohqsg
I doubt they could leave something as important as that to online,btohqsg
They use examplify lock down ur laptop,btohqsg
shag lah march i fail like dk what alrðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
They use zoom to see u lorh,btohqsg
1 laptop examplify another one to zoom,btohqsg
You are zoomed the whole exam,btohqsg
Thats what 1 of my mod is doing,btohqsg
1 laptop examplify 1 laptop zoom,btohqsg
But even zoom canâ€™t see everything,btohqsg
tutorials i just tell my cher i using monitor so no webcamðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
Just put some notes at your feet,btohqsg
Stick some notes to the screen itself,btohqsg
Then change a level to open book lorh,btohqsg
It would be so much harder,btohqsg
Open book exam dosent mean easy leh,btohqsg
They can set way harder qns,btohqsg
No more definition questions or some shit,btohqsg
A level is set years in advance,btohqsg
There isnâ€™t one in the first place,btohqsg
Shouldnt differ too far from actual score,btohqsg
My school always give some stupid concept set,btohqsg
Its like all the definition for each chapter written down,btohqsg
But it can get messy cuz they give chapter by chapter,btohqsg
How else could they organise it,btohqsg
Since a chapter would be about 2 pages then why not just make a small booklet for it,btohqsg
Not everyone is neat enough to keep those in a file,btohqsg
I think thatâ€™s kind of a basic expectation at this point  that you care enough to organise your own materials,btohqsg
The tutors got no time to bother about that,btohqsg
Its not about bothering or not  its not a drastic change,btohqsg
Rather give a booklet once and for all rather than  giving one after another after some time,btohqsg
dont get why they give out bit by bit,btohqsg
Lmao imagine being able to afford 2 laptops,btohqsg
Well time for them to pilot it out for real if the need arises,btohqsg
or just use estimated grades.. (inflation yay!),btohqsg
i mean the UK is doing it for their a levels,btohqsg
i wonder if they r still setting out papers,btohqsg
Today's number of new cases supposedly got leaked out,btohqsg
