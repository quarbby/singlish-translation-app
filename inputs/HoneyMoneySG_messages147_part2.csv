Sometimes you miss small amount to meet credit card minimum spend or bank account to get highest interest. Then small amount mark up is still worth.,btohqsg
SATS if possible. Else  Marhaba lounge.,btohqsg
I applied for the UOB CC for the free access to the free airport Lounge access. Do I need to be a priority pass member to enter or just show the UOB CC will do. Thanks.,btohqsg
The bank should send you instructions how to activate your priority pass. The lounge will only recognize that,btohqsg
Personally Marhaba is much better than Sats,btohqsg
Is the card with 4 lounge access? That can only used for yourself.,btohqsg
need to register priority pass accountSource:https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/travel/prvi-miles-card.page,btohqsg

Do you travel often? With guest? Do you value the comfort of the lounge? You can go early and rest  have a good meal instead of order the budget airline food. These are the benefits which some appreciate.,btohqsg

Hi  for voluntarily cpf contribution +tax relief. Based on cris video  top up MA first to reach BRS will help supercharge SA and hit FRS earlier. But is there any benefit of hitting FRS earlier?,btohqsg
Depends on your strategy. Yeah do VCMA to reach BHS. This will help to supercharge and reach BRS and FRS. BHS and BRS are different.,btohqsg
Sorry  Typo. Yes VCMA to reach BHS then help supercharge SA to reach FRS earlier. But is there a benefit of hitting FRS earlier? For example hitting FRS at age of 40 versus 50?,btohqsg
Compound interest but having said that you lose a way to reduce income tax subsequently,btohqsg
what is the benefit of having it compound above the FRS (eg reach frs faster) if we can't withdraw the excess interest and the top-up amount after age 55?,btohqsg
