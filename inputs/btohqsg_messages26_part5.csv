No fixed date  just 12pm or 4pm on dates after ur supposed selection date  until no more,btohqsg
what if by then none available to select?,btohqsg
Cause once u miss appointment date hdb will just assume its a non selection  till u select,btohqsg
Hi guys just to confirm  we are only allowed to choose one BTO per launch right?,btohqsg
You can actually appoint someone on behalf to select rather than you reschedule.Understand that you have commitments but no offence; there are those who have been applying for BTO/SBF for years can't even get a Q number  would desperately love to be in your position to sacrifice their time to select a unit lol ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
How strict is the hfe application?,btohqsg
hi guys can i check if i apply for this round bto chances are i will miss the sbf launch because results for bto will take a few months right?,btohqsg
SBF only once a year in Feb,btohqsg
but results for bto will take few months right,btohqsg
Is this year Oct bto out already?,btohqsg
Your time and our time different leh already put October launch u expect Sep launch?,btohqsg
I read this round thinking itâ€™s happening now lolll,btohqsg
I have a question here:My aunt got her Q number within supply (her Q number 15x  total supply i think is 400 units for 2room) for Yishun (june launched)  but not yet called for selection.So if she submit for  Oct launch (amk her 1st preferred town)  will the yishun Q number became invalid?,btohqsg
Thank you very much. Just to clarify:the system won't allow her to submit this AMK launch?,btohqsg
Stand corrected but it will block her from applying,btohqsg
Already within supply can't apply next launch no matter what,btohqsg
Hi everyone  i heard a lot of potential competition for bayshore  kallang and kembangan area this oct.Wanted to ask how the pasir ris project would be like overall as they somewhat have a seaview as well. And if any (far) east siders can give their pointers on living at the end of the train lines?,btohqsg
Oh ya  my brother is going to apply bto at Pasir Ris  cos very convenient  very close to Downtown east  mrt & next to Aranda country club.,btohqsg
Anyone got appointment for june bto flat appointment already?,btohqsg
Playing devil's advocate here  Singapore seaview is just industrial tanker views.Saltwater will corrode metal more easily too.,btohqsg
couples that want these components must remember that the price may be > $500k for a typical 4 room in the east. actually i have a feeling it's more than $550k ðŸ«£ (think of affordability & waiting time)for pasir ris  since it's opp the interchange  highly likely very noisy but yeah ofc you can install sound proof windows  curtains etc ðŸ« ,btohqsg
Anyone here appealed for the hfe before? Ideally if successful ones. Can pm me? Thanks,btohqsg
how grant is calculated? Itâ€™s much lower than I expected  and I didnâ€™t realize I was earning that much! lol,btohqsg
hello! i have a queue number outside of supply for holland v (june 2024 launch)  does anybody know whether HDB will inform us when all the selection/ bidding before our queue number has been done? or is there a way to check what units have been taken alrdy?,btohqsg
Bcos the Costa ris when it's out the price was 300+ for 4room,btohqsg
i dunno la brader. i dont work for hdb la lol. just wait the upcoming oct sales launch to see the price ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Hahaha no worries man. Just asking only la. Get house is good enough for me man,btohqsg
Hey guys  any idea if the top floor of new BTOs would be hot/high chance of leaks?,btohqsg
er..i also applying for years and always get +30-50 out of supply. for feb bto they smsed me 2 days prior to the appointment then the night before cancelled because all apartments booked and i had to take suddenly leave and wasted a day of leave. it doesnt reflect well at my workplace. this oct is also one such instance of out of supply yet got a number. so finding out a way to retain first timer without getting shafted again and cancel my trip. bro i rather they give me a firm number and a firm date way in advance then screwing me like this. its ultimate spare tyre feel. always on call. either within supply or out of supply. out of supply with a number is the worst. still love to be in my position?,btohqsg
Ohh That sounds quite bad.Do they arrange it such last minute?What if you are travelling? Lols,btohqsg
Imho it is what it is. If u cant take leave then just appoint someone else to go down on ur behalf.,btohqsg
Im missing one month of my payslipWill hdb make and exception for the hfe application,btohqsg
Ya  You can always appoint someone else to select  if not just take leave. If take leave cannot  then take MC.Nothing  is more important than selecting a flat that you are going to stay for many years to come.In 10 years time  the only person who remember your OT and hardwork at workplace is your kid.,btohqsg
Donâ€™t get the highest floor will do2nd/3rd highest all goodEg: LV 18 highest. Can get 17/16/15,btohqsg
How far out are u? I also out like #411 out of 228. Based on thc exp  chinese quota might run out for those out of supply,btohqsg
Usually they will infd u 2-3 weeks in advance for u to make arrangements/ leave/ time off etcThe process quite fast de too. Within 30-35mins settle for mine,btohqsg
Depends on the fall out rate. Pray for more drop ðŸ“‰ out. So even. If u out of supply by 50-100 still got chance to choooseBut just that stack facing & floor lvls not so desirable la .,btohqsg
Would like to know  if a couple who own a 5rm bto (within mop) divorced before 35yo. Does anyone of them still can own the 5rm legally or must sell?,btohqsg
Either one who has care and control of the kids can keep the house.,btohqsg
Take My situation as exampleNow i have kids  if stay already haven't MOPMust sell or who has the care and control can take the flat with the childIf now waiting for key collection i separate with my wife  same   if my wife don't want the flat but has care and control of the child she must give me permission to use the child name to continue to get this HDB unit.,btohqsg
then dead. ah my bad it wasnt 2 days. it was 4 days. 4 days to prep for something entirely unfamiliar. bto first timer after all. amazing right,btohqsg
26th send notice for 29th 1030am. then 28th 8pm send notice dont need to go down. this is ultimate spare tyre booty call man.,btohqsg
i think they cater to 30% numbered out of supply. eg 100 supply they give number to 130 ppl. so 30pax spare tyre,btohqsg
Before that 2 weeks ago shld also have another sms,btohqsg
Ya i had 2 wk before and 3d before,btohqsg
it shld be sent exactly 2 weeks prior,btohqsg
rather they just throw to sbf. then lump all the locations sbf together. numbered out of supply is the worst,btohqsg
If you have been working that month  are u able to ask ur HR to provide?If you weren't working  has your partner worked for the full 12 months?Personally I also missed out one month  but since my partner worked the full 12  our HFE was still approved,btohqsg
Why? Iâ€™m interested in the rationale,btohqsg
Bto quality so lousy these days?,btohqsg
