Hi Everyone  does it qualifies the Salary Crediting component if my employer uses FAST to credit my salary to UOB One account?,btohqsg
Yes  SingSaver issue. Waiting for my Paynow reward for April Application. My wife applied via MoneySmart in May and already received it,btohqsg
Hihi  can u give a screen shot of the credit transaction of your salary? Please remember to mask out the sensitive information,btohqsg
should be ok if the purpose chosen for the FAST is Salary,btohqsg
Right now it‚Äôs still credited to POSB,btohqsg
Hi. I don‚Äôt think so. It usually has to be 1) Giro  OR 2) paynow salary,btohqsg
Something to share for those taking budget airline. Sometime it‚Äôs cheaper to book a return flight separately. Outgoing usually sgd. but return pay in foreign currency (the country u visit). The return flight is usually cheaper by a lot due to no currency conversion.,btohqsg
I would share with u mine by end of the day that qualify. Need time to pull out and mask info.,btohqsg
by right yes  but by left...,btohqsg
Hi  can someone with experience help me out here.Currently with UOB lady‚Äôs card. Can I pair it up with Instarem Amaze card to pay for foreign online (off physical) transactions  still earning bonus UNi$ - namely currently 6mpd?,btohqsg
Really? Based on your recent experience?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs great! Can officially migrate cos my employer SME and no HR dept.,btohqsg
Should get 6mpd so long mcc under your selected categories. No personal experience though.,btohqsg
Because I have checked UOB lady‚Äôs card T&C  they write to exclude Amaze*transaction for Uni$. But I also hear it can earn bonus points. So I am very confused  this asking in this group for some experience.,btohqsg
*thus asking here for experienced friends to share some encounters,btohqsg
Confirmed can. As long as mcc within your selected categories.Uob lady card does mcc filters. Not name filters. Be careful of travel classification though. Many monkey mccs.,btohqsg
Currently getting 5.14% FD 6months. Still the best FD rate for passive income.,btohqsg
Just got rejected for ocbc 365  not sure why since annual income is more than the requirementAny alternatives for everyday spending?Also first time applying for cc in sg  do we need to open an account with the bank we want to apply cc with ? Or no needThank you,btohqsg
What is your fixed minimum spend per month?  (Yes there are better cards out there)No need to open account with bank issuing cc,btohqsg
Prev i worked overseas  working in Singapore for 1yr +,btohqsg
How long to get cashback from yuu card har ?,btohqsg
Today is Friday again and that means $3 cashback from DBS Paylah Hawker promo!üëâ DBS Paylah $5 code CHRHAF684I got Laksa Yong Tau Foo today  which is a well-loved dish that combines noodles and beancurd products with fish paste in a delicious way. The noodles are cooked in a spicy and flavorsome broth  and then accompanied by a range of vegetables and tofu. This comforting and satisfying meal is often garnished with crispy fried shallots and served with shrimp paste on the side.Cost of meal: $4.00Cost of drink: $1.00DBS Cashback: ($3.00)Net cost for lunch: $2.00üëâ Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgüëâ More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
Assuming you're on team Cashback  you can look into DBS live fresh  UOB EVOL or POSB Everyday (not sure what your spend categories are)Will help if anyone in team Cashback can add on  I'm a miles guy üòÇ,btohqsg
Thanks for the suggestionMajority my spending is on dining/food delivery   and then offline/online shopping i guess,btohqsg
What would be your recommendation for miles card ?,btohqsg
I actually follow Chris's strategy of using Citi Rewards with Instarem Amaze as my general card  then travel related expenses or after maxing that out  I personally use the HSBC Revolution (most MCCs are covered) and a general spend card (Citi PremierMiles or UOB KrisFlyer) in the event I max out these two cardsLike Cashback card  be wary of rewards cap.Unlike Cashback cards  miles card don't have a minimum spend but u need to be careful of points expiry.That said  also keep in mind the trouble of looking out for annual fees if you hold too many cards and don't utilise them often,btohqsg
I see  thanks for suggestion and explanation üôè,btohqsg
That's the best for me at the moment.,btohqsg
A question on the Citi Payall. What happens if we didnt hit the 8k. All the fee goes down the drain? Or will be refunded?,btohqsg
Wah sian means fee goes down the drain ü•≤,btohqsg
Is transferring to investments related company counted? E.g Syfe,btohqsg
UOB ladies card dont care about online or offline  they just look at the category. which for normal card you can only choose 1.But i guess pair with Amaze might get better rates when overseas at say dining category,btohqsg
No ah  you still get base points,btohqsg
Trying to leh but I seem to have only tax and insurance to pay using Payall,btohqsg
"can say ""donate"" to anyone in your family and ask them transfer back",btohqsg
The base point can get without going through Payall mah,btohqsg
Certain places don‚Äôt accept credit cards  or credit card don‚Äôt have points like insurance,btohqsg
Hmm true. Nv thought of that.,btohqsg

this guy always promote NZD FD in a Singapore forum  not sure why but maybe he is from New Zealand or is just personal preference  but anyone if want to follow pls DYODD,btohqsg
not sure what your true intentions are for the continued advertising of cimb nzd fd. why dont you specifically state that you are referring to nzd instead of posting rates and trying to get reactions from others.or are you cimb rm and need more depositsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
I tot is sgd have so high interest,btohqsg
SGD not so high  this person has been promoting CIMB NZD FD for past few days..,btohqsg
the way he presents sounds so baity. out of nowhere he says im getting 5.xx% interest  best fd rate for passive income,btohqsg
He keeps saying Citi+Amaze.I keep saying CIMB SG FD.Well  it's up to you to think what you want.,btohqsg
you are misleading people  people will think you say CIMB SG FD is in SGD when u are referring to NZD,btohqsg
It's pure FD no need to do this & that like EGA.,btohqsg
since 2022 till now nzd has depreciated against sgd by 17.5% not worth it,btohqsg
its ok he got 5.14% pa for 6 monthsü§ë,btohqsg
You can look at USD FD if you like.,btohqsg
