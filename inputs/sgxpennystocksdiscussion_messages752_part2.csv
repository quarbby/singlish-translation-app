On Dec 14  it also bought back 1.4 million shares at 34 cents each while on Dec 16  it acquired 800 000 shares at between 33.5 cents and 34 cents each.In 3QFY2022 ended Sept 30  2022  the company sold a smaller volume of coal but because of higher average selling prices  revenue for the quarter was up 7% y-o-y to US$165 million ($220 million). Earnings for the quarter came in at US$36 million versus US$45 million in 3QFY2021 because of higher costs and other expenses.Flushed with cash from the past year of healthy profits  Geo Energy declared a third interim dividend of 1 cent each  bringing the total FY2022 dividend payout to five cents per share. This amount represents a payout ratio of 36% for its net 9MFY2022 earnings. The company is trading at an annualised priceto-earnings ratio of less than two times and below its enterprise value of US$162 million.See also: Jumbo and Thakral in the buyback spotlightGeo Energy expects coal prices to remain strong in the near term in line with the overall energy market. The company notes that demand for coal has further increased due to the larger-than-expected coal consumption amid an extreme summer season  which reinforced the pressure on coal restocking with winter loomingRegional recruiter buys back sharesHRnetGroup is steadily buying back shares.

CPI data is goodie as expected while labor market is still robust.This could point to a possibility of lower interest rate hike in the Feb FOMC meeting. Market participants are welcoming the positive outcome.Still market is always volatile and monetary condition is still tightening. Let's still hope for a strong showing tonight  if not a healthy pullback is good too.,btohqsg
