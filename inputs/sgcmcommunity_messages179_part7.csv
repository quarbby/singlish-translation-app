I last time do SAF ops stuff during nsf days,btohqsg
So quite strict on the no move time,btohqsg
U pay for business to function?,btohqsg
I know of that perspective also  it's only annoying when they take the right most lane and hog. Then one long tail of cars behind them  all stuck behind a wall. If they truly in a rush then drive faster,btohqsg
Actually if the commercial vehicles don't hog  no one would really care if they are on whatever lane. It's only when their convenience causes others inconvenience then people notice,btohqsg
What is first lane and what is the speed limit,btohqsg
I know you will say that  they hog at 30  speed limit is 50 or 80/90,btohqsg
Hog at 30? Show vid lei,btohqsg
Going to post soon .. too many videos to sort. Just wait,btohqsg
So TP at Lane 1 90kmh. Is he hogging?,btohqsg
90 is the limit it's not,btohqsg
It's when they are obviously way below then I consider hog,btohqsg
Then if a normal passenger car at 90kmh at Lane 1  is he hogging?,btohqsg
What is your problem  no one mentioned going at speed limit right,btohqsg
Throwing red herrings here don't serve any purpose,btohqsg
Now I know why this chat many leaving  because of the toxicity,btohqsg
I have no actual issues w hogging,btohqsg
Lane 2 slow  go lane 3 cut lor,btohqsg
Lane 3 slow  go lane 4 cut lor,btohqsg
Ok next time I show you some videos  I also want to cut and go  all lanes blocked. Even want to consider going to lane 4 and back which is dangerous also cannot,btohqsg
Because of this. So hard to cut and go. I also no time to waste behind them cut and disappear already. If only can,btohqsg
thks for the advice everyone! i really see the usual suspects... Honda  Toyota  Mazda. Got see Hyundai but not the Avante.,btohqsg
Actually it's not the brand but the driver la. Seen enough in the past 20 years driving. They generally are also very inconsiderate people in real life off the roads. Personality doesn't change,btohqsg
