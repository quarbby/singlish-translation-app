While ppl around me are doing work in the morning,btohqsg
Yea but it is also hard to take a break when u know exams are coming up,btohqsg
i think its unproductive for me personally,btohqsg
Then pushing through a little by a little is kinda better than doing nothing,btohqsg
Tbh i find there no purpose in last min studying before the eoys (looking through is ok but learning new stuff is ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬),btohqsg
Id rather just listen to a twice song and chill,btohqsg
