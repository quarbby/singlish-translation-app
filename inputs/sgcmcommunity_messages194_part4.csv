Those EV car that dont use mirror but use wide angle lense is one of the way,btohqsg
They use camera n display on it dash,btohqsg
But no point la  usually accident happen not because of blind spot  is because the driver dont bother to check at all,btohqsg
Can buy from shopee cheap cheap,btohqsg
Then paste to your side mirror,btohqsg
Last time learn to drive  instructor always ask u to look behind ur back when change lane. I was thinking why car maker don’t make mirror to eliminate all blindspots,btohqsg

Think they don’t want to take responsibility… driver can easily say blind spot not visible from his seating position and ends up as manufacturer liability.,btohqsg

My beetle have rear camera that acts as a digital rear view mirror+ dashcam,btohqsg
No brand as such … generally asking if we’re to consider a 3rd party retrofit.,btohqsg
Interesting… I thought rear dash cam & rear view cam had to be different set of cam. Does it come with wireless CarPlay too.,btohqsg
The product is good but the software kns,btohqsg
I never play with the software,btohqsg
Pure view cars behind my back,btohqsg
Motorist app alrdy have this function for some time.,btohqsg
no need distractions like car play,btohqsg
Basically think of the rear view mirror as a LCD screen for the rear camera lol,btohqsg
Yes I saw some videos in YouTube.. very nice. Gives a nice & wider view of road behind too. Definitely seems a good upgrade.,btohqsg
Yes… but sometimes  after checking blind spot… next moment  a bicycle zoom out,btohqsg
They stupid  but we will take the blame if we knock them,btohqsg
