Is it the samr for As,btohqsg
Do they know the exact percentage?,btohqsg
My teacher told my senior that if he had done better for one section of the maths paper then he could have scored better,btohqsg
Maybe your senior just discussed the paper with your teacher after the paper,btohqsg
Breaking news: if you get more marks you could get a better grade,btohqsg
Secret tips and tricks teachers don’t want you to know,btohqsg
How did the teacher know that he did badly in that one section of the paper?,btohqsg
If the teacher knew how he performed for one section of the paper  does that not mean that she knew the marks that he scored?,btohqsg
She told him ‘if you did better for this (particular section) you would have gotten a better grade’,btohqsg
After the results were released last year,btohqsg
Something as specific as assuming which section of the paper he did badly in,btohqsg
Is like a little too specific,btohqsg
Maybe it was just a passing comment,btohqsg
I don’t think people do that?,btohqsg
Ya but reassurance based on a pretty far fetched assumption?,btohqsg
Let’s just leave this between your senior and your teacher  I think you would feel more at peace✌️,btohqsg
no one will ever know the exact marks unless seab internal,btohqsg
and which teacher so free to find out the mark breakdown of every student,btohqsg
or even which questions they get wrong or correct,btohqsg
plus teachers only know whats up with the previous year exam papers when they go for briefing with seab,btohqsg
like this cohort did well in so and so topics,btohqsg
and did badly in so and so whatever,btohqsg
And what subject was that in?,btohqsg
Only thing I can understand teachers sayin that will be for science exams with practicals since that is marked by ur teachers so they know ur scores.Otherwise as long as the papers are marked by Cambridge  it is not possible to know the exact score.,btohqsg
The practicals are marked by the Teachers?,btohqsg
ya so ur teacher wont know,btohqsg
wah im done talking abt this le,btohqsg
basically theres no point worrying about ur exact raw score since u wont really know (unless you try to estimate),btohqsg
Rubbish. That was the old SPA system. Its now back to a practical set by Cambridge for 3 years now...,btohqsg
From what I know its still internal marking since each school produces different practical results  making it impossible for standardisation if cambridge marks it.,btohqsg
Of course  you can correct me on this if you are a current MOE teacher teaching science,btohqsg
Very misinformed. A teacher does the practical at the same time as the students. The teachers results are used as a base to compare against students answers   and marked by Cambridge.,btohqsg
Holy shit why didnt i think of that,btohqsg
Hello to students who have just finished o levels! results will be soon and I would like to ask if there would be a demand for a free jc trial class for H2 math!

Hi anyone has sec 1 NT maths paper to share? Thanks,btohqsg
In regards to the parameter stated in the question  if I were to have a web app that only works on mobile (or specialised for mobile)  does that count as a web app or mobile app?,btohqsg
Those websites that you can save to your phone and it works similar to a mobile app afterwards.,btohqsg
