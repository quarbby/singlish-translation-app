thank you sir i loaded and up,btohqsg
Must caution you to be careful with this one. Dyodd jiayou,btohqsg
Fast & Easy Test but not accurate üòû,btohqsg
ho ching whack biolidics serology test when it is launched talking about false positive blah blha,btohqsg
not as accurate but as long can pick out any case is good step,btohqsg
Picking up wrong person who is no infected is not an issue. The issue is the infected got scot free due to the inaccuracy...,btohqsg
it use with concurrent PCR for sure,btohqsg
so those they tested positive  quarantine first. even if false positive also safety first,btohqsg
if pure PCR also got positive lurk out around while waiting,btohqsg
Those tested negative but are actually infected???,btohqsg
risk of any test kitsurely have suchbut the slippage will be lower than if antigen test not used,btohqsg
i feel that most likely SG will return to open borders once all the citizen received at least one vaccination,btohqsg
"But they are less sensitive than PCR tests and may miss some cases that are actually COVID-19 positive  Mr Lee pointed out.""If you visit a GP (general practitioner) or polyclinic now with an acute respiratory infection  you will be given an ART  in addition to a PCR test. Within 30 minutes the ART will show whether you are likely to have COVID-19 "" he explained.""If the result is positive  you can immediately be isolated. And the PCR test will confirm your diagnosis later  which may take a day or two. That way we reduce your chances of infecting others  if you are already ill but don‚Äôt realise it.""These alternatives to PCR tests can help to detect and isolate people quickly when they are most infectious  said Mr Lee.""This will be a big help in slowing down the spread of COVID-19.‚Äùvas u mentioned",btohqsg
think these quick ART type tests may be the default testing for mass events in future for quick processing,btohqsg
think all test kits manufacturers should be very huat for the next few years,btohqsg
BB log in buy biolidics liao haha,btohqsg
