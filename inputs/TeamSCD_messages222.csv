Last one when reverse parking at workshop then end up no batt  had to run to the nearby bangala hostel to borrow power point to recharge my jump start kit.,btohqsg
Alternator dead it's call tow truck already,btohqsg
Was thinking of saving money for the tow. End up I just went ahead and drove it to the workshop.,btohqsg

The steering did lock during the drive. Slowly one by one things start to shut down. Eps  abs everything.Even the dashboard also stopped working. Lastly is the engine  when you step pedal like how many days you never eat.,btohqsg
