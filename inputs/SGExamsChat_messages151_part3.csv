What do you mean by wrong inference?,btohqsg
I wrote for 6 go extra mile and pick up litter,btohqsg
like “ do u agree “ u put no but the ans suppose to be yes,btohqsg
Example would be by Ms Elina Ng programme ‘ a little at a time’,btohqsg
Hahahah i wrote pick up litter also,btohqsg
It was volunteer in organisations that pick up litter,btohqsg
7 is about FDO for safeguarding interest,btohqsg
And then about FDO for provision of goods and services,btohqsg
Like if you got 3 IEE,btohqsg
i tot it will minus like 2-3 nark oni,btohqsg
But I know 1 agree and 1 disagree is 5 ?,btohqsg
huh rly ah i rmb for prelims i wrote 2 full sources and halfway for one more source i got 7 marks HAHA,btohqsg
So the moral of the story for me when I took my combined humanities is that no matter how bad your answer is,btohqsg
You can get a lot of marks from it all the time.,btohqsg
Ummm it’s not measured by your length of answer,btohqsg
If you let say simple simple,btohqsg
i anyhow whack my prelim source e qns i got 7 so i kinda agree HAHAH,btohqsg
But not necessary have to write ah Ma story,btohqsg
i tot o level thrs only bellcurve,btohqsg
nvm ignore my advice it's quite risky to go by my way although it works for me,btohqsg
History so bad I thought we had a story,btohqsg
i cant geo at all lol,btohqsg
Geog depends on teacher but usually if you have a good one  possible to score 75 and above I guess,btohqsg
do yall think ur geog/hist can pull ur ss up HAHAH,btohqsg
Personally feel its a double edged sword,btohqsg
If you ask my class  the answer will be hell No but for me and my friend I think it pulled me up by 2 grades.,btohqsg
Geography is one of the subjects you can score full marks,btohqsg
unless you speedrun lorms with all marks,btohqsg
Depends. For me  my ss is way better than geography.,btohqsg
the problem is the time constraint,btohqsg
for me my humans all hopeless,btohqsg
(also anyone got last minute mugging advice my eoy’s is in like 1.5 week and i’ve revised nothing),btohqsg
If you are starting from scratch  dont bother,btohqsg
especially for humans since its very like practice based,btohqsg
For my sec 3 eoy  I never did a single practice paper,btohqsg
Tell that to my friends which score 100 and just passed their ss,btohqsg
geog is okay its better than my ss honestly HAHAH,btohqsg
Me and my friends have free tuition from a geog teacher,btohqsg
ss prob can study in 3 hours,btohqsg
It isn't that hard to score full marks for ss.,btohqsg
Hist prob can memorise 3 chapters in 1 day,btohqsg
i mean some of geog’s memorisation can be related to basic logic,btohqsg
English dont bother for compre  just focus on paper 1. Dont give shit handwriting,btohqsg
like legit every time i do i always barely pass  sometimes even fail,btohqsg
I always fail or just pass compre but paper 1 pull me to A2,btohqsg
i depend on my writing to pass,btohqsg
N level is different from o mate.,btohqsg
Agreed. I failed that for prelims,btohqsg
Based on what I remember  n level English isn't as difficult as o level.,btohqsg
my saving grace is section c summary,btohqsg
