Hi  does it make sense to pair amaze with Citibank cashback card for overseas travel spending?,btohqsg
Interest probably mainly depends on whats gg on w the macro environment?Think extra 25k isnt too much for the govt considering inflation,btohqsg
yes for overseas dining  groceries and petrol,btohqsg
It is also partially dependent on the amount of sdic premium that banks banks have to contribute,btohqsg
uh  u talking about citi cashback card right? only 0.25% cashback for shopping  not even enough to cover markup for Amaze.,btohqsg
Shopping with amaze+CRMC? Depends where u shop  imo,btohqsg

depends u prefer 10xpoints (4mpd) or 6-8% cashback on dining/groceries/petrol. Can always switch which card to link to Amaze also.,btohqsg

Furthermore  the rate of change of short term interest rates is slowing down  in line with the Fed’s dot plots. Higher for longer  hence range bound around this level is the likely outcome  my view only,btohqsg
No tips  read more before starting your investment. There’s a lot of information out there.US is still the best  you can try SGX but I’m not well versed on it.

Cashback rate 2.5% capped at $70 (minimum $2001  maximum $2800 purchase / month) + qualify for EGA 5 transactions with $5k incoming (other bank) for extra 1%. Add it to instarem amaze for extra 0.5% before charging.2. Standard Chartered Mahanttan World Master Card for extra 3% cashback capped at $200 (minimum $3000  maximum purchase $6666 /quarter). Add it to instarem amaze for extra 0.5% before charging.,btohqsg

are you buying from Shopee  Lazada .... if yes 0.3% cashback,btohqsg
I bought a printer from Courts and cashback only 0.3%,btohqsg
I just want spend and get first reward only😂,btohqsg
What is the charge called? I never see it,btohqsg
Cat and fiddle so cheap only $1.06?,btohqsg
Why need to pair to amaze in this scenario?,btohqsg
I would argue it is always safer to pair crmc with amaze. No downside at all.,btohqsg
Yes  sometimes it happened  I got it like a few months ago,btohqsg
Usually refund process is only troublesome from travel related spending. Which is excluded from crmc. So unlikely to use.,btohqsg
No different between iPhone or not in this scenario,btohqsg
You may get cancel and refund from shopee and Lazada too,btohqsg
What’s the issue? Just refund loh,btohqsg
Usually less than 1 month  like 3 weeks after statement date  but I have not use it for a few months,btohqsg
will it auto back to the original card?,btohqsg
Depends on merchant. U try loh,btohqsg
Yes  so what is the question?,btohqsg
That’s why I don’t want to pair amaze to unnecessary one,btohqsg
And u don’t see that as a benefit… hmmm,btohqsg
And what do you see the benefit to pair it for local online transactions?,btohqsg
All expenses from sup card will be counted as main holder lo. I think only the main holder can earn miles,btohqsg
Yeah I was thinking if the supp card holder would have their own krisflyer number under their name. Guess not.,btohqsg
Another approach  secured card for unqualified human? Guess that’s the only way,btohqsg
I feel secured cards are not worth it since u lock up funds which could earn higher returns,btohqsg
Next statement  but some people said it will be awarded even before new statement,btohqsg
If buy phones from shopee with credit card from non authorised resellers  js that still eligible for the bonus point mccs?,btohqsg
Well I think there's a difference as android can connect your amaze to Google pay.,btohqsg
I mean for the scenarios mentioned earlier,btohqsg
Never buy phone for shopee  but usually cheaper electronics staff like $100 or less are counted,btohqsg
Not sure if secured card is eligible for SUB.if it is eligible  a 10K FD for UOB Prvi SUB is not too bad 🤣🤣 provided there is no other way,btohqsg
I had this before. Secured card w/ uob which had a supp card,btohqsg
For this ocbc frank card8% on cash back on online and contactless mobile transactions,btohqsg
Is it I just link credit card to samsung or Google payAnd use the apps to make the transaction?,btohqsg
Yes  but it's $980  being $450 cheaper than singlife. My thought is that the credit doesn't really matter already in this case. some more it's term  cancel anytime  no cash value😳😳,btohqsg
Look for coverage till what age,btohqsg
Is it counted to min spend for UOB One or UOB EVOL too?,btohqsg
Hi  I would like to time the signup of HSBC credit card application. Approx what cashback amount would be considered high? Right now is $150 only  not high right?,btohqsg
Will the MCC still be the same if i use shopback with linked payment method as Maybank Family n Friends? Can i still get cashback from F&F?,btohqsg
Anyone knows the mcc for MBS rise restaurant? Under hotel or dining?,btohqsg
To be clear what I meant is this.Term life that covers till 75 will obviously be much cheaper than term life that covers till 100.The former unlikely to get pay out.The latter will most certainty get pay out.,btohqsg
Hi all. If my contractors for renovation do not accept credit cards  is there any other way I can earn cashback/miles? I tried working out the card up route but the extra 2.6% isn't worth it. Will I still get points for Citi Rewards if I link my citi rewards card to grabpay (not top up)?,btohqsg
Why I cannot post photo here,btohqsg
Hi  can i check if i am qualified for both the moneysmart and citibank credit card sign up bonus if i sign up via the moneysmart website?,btohqsg
sorry i nvr use citi payall before  but is this considered credit card payment?,btohqsg
Citi payall charge you 2.2% professing fee.,btohqsg
ah I see. ok thank you!,btohqsg
sorry one more qn. if I link my citi rewards to the grab pay and pay via grab pay (no topping up)  will I enjoy reward points from citi? somehow my contractor accepts grab pay.,btohqsg
U cannot pay with Grabpay linked to Citibank.,btohqsg
Any special access code for chocolate? How to sign up immediately?,btohqsg
Hello all! Can i check how do i transfer my kris+ miles to my krisflyer Account? Can't seem to find any tab for it,btohqsg
Only for miles that u just earned from the kris+ transaction.,btohqsg
Ohhh  so after the transaction i have to immediately click the button on the screen to transfer?,btohqsg
Correct.But I’m sure there is a way to transfer if u accidentally closed the screen but I never dare to try. Deadline is 7 days.,btohqsg
Thank you so much for clarifying!,btohqsg
Do you know if can withdraw before the bonus comes in once reach 30 days?,btohqsg
Can always go to wallet→ Miles History→Transaction Details to transfer if you didn't do it earlier.,btohqsg
Yes  you can after close the page,btohqsg
Hi. Anyone knows if I can still earn 5% if I made purchase using Citi smrt cc to buy klook voucher on shopback?,btohqsg
Hi  am I eligible for the 2.5% + 1% cash back when I use HSBC revolution to book hotel onbooking.com?,btohqsg
You need to check what is the mcc code of the merchants. You can search using either merchant name eg. “Booking.com” or mcc code at:https://heymax.aiThe website will also propose a list of best credit cards to use  then you can check credit card TnC is it in whitelist or exclusion listGood luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
I will be spending 5 digit @ Mount Alvernia next mount. What is the best card cashback to use to pay for this?I have Citi Cashback+,btohqsg
u can PM me i still have 4 invites,btohqsg
I used heymax to search ShopBack. It says “furniture”. Sounds like it won’t be Dining category even if I used ShopBack in a restaurant?,btohqsg
shopback uses a range of MCCs  and usually follows the MCC of the merchant if using shopback pay (but not always)the only guaranteed way to find out what MCC your particular shopback txn is  is using dbs block card method,btohqsg
Hi  how others get 3.63% interest for maribank?,btohqsg
Are you Maribank customer?  If yes  you will know.,btohqsg
Ya  I sign up last month.,btohqsg
Mayb I withdraw my money out. That's y nv get.,btohqsg
Thats for mari bank invest. 2.88 is for their digital savinga bank,btohqsg
Hi guys any recommendation for a good cash back card?Scenario: I’m getting a new phone and would like to also get some cash back on then purchase,btohqsg
Currently I am looking at the SC Smart credit card and the OCBC frank card,btohqsg
ocbc frank is not good because of the rebate cap. SC smart only award bonus points for specific merchants  none selling phone.,btohqsg
Then ocbc frankThe contactless paymentIs it just link the credit card to samsung payThen use samsung pay to payThen is consider contactless payment?,btohqsg
yes if tap the phone at contactless machine. but low rebate cap and high min sum in a month makes it a lousy card,btohqsg
But it mention 8% cash back?,btohqsg
Coz due to the cap problem? 25?,btohqsg
There is no way to get 8% on the card given the $25 rebate cap for local online/mobile contactless  ($25 for spend in foreign currency) and min $800 monthly spend.,btohqsg
Oo coz I also seldom use credit card one😂My goal is get first user reward only😂Normally I go those stall under hdbNo chance to keep use credit card d,btohqsg
Hi.anyone know if ShopBack cash back any cap?,btohqsg
I m interested to know too,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I’m using CardUp linked to Citi rewards CC to pay for car loan let’s say 1ksgd. Do I get the 4 mpd for the first 1k or just 1mpd ?,btohqsg
if you're referring to the cashback displayed in-app for online voucher purchases  or the cashback % displayed on shopback QR standees  nopethere is a daily cashback withdrawal limit though,btohqsg
1. Uob Amex Absolute: 1.7%2. Amex true cashback: 1.5% (cashback within month  no need wait till next month)3. Amaze +CRMC: 4mpd4. 1.5mpd/1.4mpd/1.3mpd/1.2mpd card (need be from citibank  standard chartered to be rewarded from spending in hospital),btohqsg
Using phone contactless payment at 7-11 store on uob evol card is eligible for the 8%? I tried search onheymax.aiit written only 1%. Do anyone know which am I eligible?,btohqsg
How much did you lose since you cancel?,btohqsg
Or maybe try AMEX platinum card,btohqsg
Hey guys  is OCBC GSP12 safe and worth it?,btohqsg
Dont ever cancel. Can do an absolute assignment and sell it to relatives/friends if there's cash value upon maturity,btohqsg
I just went to look through Citi Cashback+ T&C. Seems like hospital MCC they will award 1.6% cashback too,btohqsg
It is 3.5% pa for 2 years lock-in.I think it’s decent if u don’t want to bother with investments or shifting money around.,btohqsg
2 years is a long time… a lot of things can change by then. It’s really for the strong hands with lots of spare cash to make this worthwhile,btohqsg
Especially with today’s shortened business cycles,btohqsg
cimb fastsaver non lock in already 3.5%,btohqsg
Yeah be very very sure you won't touch the money for 2 years.. you try to get out of the 2 year plan  sure lose money one.,btohqsg
Hmmm but t bills is 3.75% for 6 mths  and if rates do drop  prob stocks will hv much higher returns by then,btohqsg
hence my reasoning in the latter part of my sentence.,btohqsg
nope its like hsbc ega base on one specific month prior  if ur new its starts from 0,btohqsg
Heymax did tell you why only 1% if you click n see the details.,btohqsg
Rhb 1 year fixed deposit 3.6 to 3.68%U can consider if dont keen in moomoo or chocolate.,btohqsg
👍 Online or via RHB banking apps. I happened to enquire.,btohqsg
ex  u want the exchange rate from sgd to usd to be as low as possible  $1SGD = $1 USD best.,btohqsg
Morning all  is there currently no way to pay with amaze on the iPhone? Couldn't add it to apple pay and there's no NFC for Gpay?,btohqsg
This reminds me of quite a few people being fearful of the RMB and China/BRICS taking over the USD as the default trading currency of the world. You can search my views in this chat history on why this will take a long time due to many factors discussed. Congratulations to those who have kept their faith with the USD and earned super interest thru fixed income  FDs etc since last year. The easy trade had been made though  trade with care,btohqsg
So u put one time 10k   u receive 3.5% for every month for this 10k?,btohqsg
only way is to switch to android phone,btohqsg
nope  need to use physical card or android phone,btohqsg
You put it $10k  you get monthly interest about= $10k x 3.5% x (31 days/365days)=  $29.72,btohqsg
Well noted  what I wanted is to be covered until 65 only.  😂😂  so 1m for death and TPD  and 300k for critical illness. HSBC premium only $980...,btohqsg
ok this one no right no wrong.. i think this way.when you buy term life.. do you want:1. to confirm be able to claim (leave a legacy behind) = buy the more expensive term life till 1002. almost impossible to claim unless unexpected event = buy the cheaper term life till 65/75.Note if your cover ends at 65... it also means when u need it the most  you are not covered.... think carefully.,btohqsg

Anyone who has retired  sold away your assets to buy annuity plan? What are the best ones in the market right now? Heard retirees entry age start from 40 years old and can buy maximum $2m per policy.I didn't see anyone talks about it in the chat history,btohqsg
Wow I can only say this is quite a dangerous thought....You definitely need all the insurance u can have  covering you  when you are old and most likely to fall ill.,btohqsg
the best annuity in Singapore  legit and for real  is CPF LIFE.,btohqsg
CPF LIFE can start at 40 years old? I thought 65.I am looking for annuity that starts at entry age 40 years old or younger so that can qualify for MM2H's retirement visa monthly income requirement of 40k ringgit,btohqsg
I haven't analysed MM2H requirements  but can investment income qualify?You can probably achieve the same/better results with a portfolio of SSBs + Tbills?$40k ringgit is about SGD13k which at conservative 3% p.a. would require a portfolio of about SGD5 million.,btohqsg
Please do calculations before you decide.Most term life until 100 is 5-6 times multiplier  which means you probably pay about $150-200k total of premiums and it pays out $1 million if you pass away before the cover ends.Insurance company won't lose money because it is time value of money.,btohqsg
Perhaps you can get a quote from your agent (i am not agent)  work out the IRR  and decide for yourself if it is worth it.(you will be pleasantly surprised),btohqsg
Do wait for Chris’s MM2H video  hopefully it will share this 👍🏻,btohqsg
Is he doing that? I thought he is going to do social visit pass runs?,btohqsg
If I didn’t understand wrongly  he will clarify how he is doing it,btohqsg
Can get 29.72 monthly without adding more funds?,btohqsg
Uob merchant? Not every phone contactless payment I am eligible for the 8%?,btohqsg
You need to to read the Evol TnC. I don’t think anybody in this group can tell you word by word  sentence by sentence in details on all credit card TnC.,btohqsg
"For me is my uob one is expiring in Oct 2023  I check with the cso if the card has been sent out on 22nd sep as I've seen the pending activation in my ibank for weeks but not receive the card. The cso told me the card will be sent out in 4 days.. but now I realised I can't make any online and offline payment using the card at all. When I checked with the cso now if I can't meet the min spending this mth due to unable to use the cc now  how will it affect my rebate and I was told ""the rebate will be affected if you did not meet the min spending"" 🥸",btohqsg
It's strange.. coz for other banks  I'll receive the new card months before the old card expires and also before I activate the new card  I can still use my old card as long as it hasn't expired... but it doesn't seem to be the case for uob,btohqsg
except UOB One card  any other card give benefit pay utility?,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword “utilities card” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Hi All  I came across these retirement plan recommended by CPF. Anyone bought it and anyone able to share like is it good to buy or DIY to robo or ETF?,btohqsg
the parts by CPF just before IN CONCLUSION actually sum it up best:As we’ve already gathered  private annuity plans come with their fair share of bells and whistles (such as insurance protection  premium waivers and bonuses). However  when you compare them to our national annuity scheme  it falls short on multiple aspects  particularly on guaranteed returns and duration of payout.While private annuity plans promise enticing interest rates at first glance  the heart of the matter is that these rates are made up of both guaranteed and non-guaranteed components. If the non-guaranteed component does not perform well  you’ll be left to rely on the guaranteed interest rate that is not as high as you might have thought (think around the 2% range).In addition  not all annuity plans promise a lifetime payout. Save for Aviva MyLifeIncome II and Manulife RetireReady Plus II  the other annuity plans offer a fixed term only — which means there’s a chance of you outliving the monthly payouts A.K.A. the main reason why you’re even considering an annuity plan.Then there are CPF LIFE’s essentially risk-free returns. As a national scheme  it’s able to spread out risk across a bigger population. Similarly  you can enjoy monthly payouts for life — even after the premiums are used up — as a result of the accumulated interest.,btohqsg
Thanks so much for the explanation,btohqsg
Hi  can i check with u guys how long usually OCBC Titanium Credit Cards will get any status update? Had applied from moneysmart since last Thu  till now didn't receive any email or sms  called the customer service always engaged,btohqsg

Just turned 18 today and i want to ask if opening multiple banks like UOB/OCBC/standard chartered is feasible and better than just relying on one bank like DBS is beneficial i have no knowledge about banks,btohqsg
what do you mean like beneficial ? in terms of interest wise or ?,btohqsg
Happy birthday🥳🥳 good to have multiple banks for more ATM options. In case 1 long queue,btohqsg
"UOB is one of the ""best"" for interest  if you are able to spend 500$ per month + credit salary of 1.6k per month for the highest interest. Credit salary can be done via PAYNOW from another bank",btohqsg
Better to have more than 1 bank  eg: access to more ATMs  different banks have different types of promos with credit cards (bonus savings interest and credit card cashback).Also each savings account is limited to $75k SDIC insurance  so u don’t want to put too much money in 1 account too.Advice is to see which bank has savings account opening promo  then go for that. UOB  SC  HSBC should always have promos.,btohqsg
I see but like when is having too much good or bad for u when opening accounts,btohqsg
make sure you don't pay fall below fee for bank accounts  some bank accounts got fall below fee when below $x xxx,btohqsg

If you are turning 18 and not much saving  just open 1 bank will do. Some banks have fall below fee. If all your bank’s accounts are hit with fall below fee every month  you likely will cry. 🥲.,btohqsg

Hello! Just to inform TD Ameritrade Singapore has announced today that they will now focus only Accredited Investors.

Hi  anyone usingZYMsim only planIs everything smooth ? Network good ? Port over process fast ?,btohqsg
is moomoo or webull better to transfer my entire assets via ACAT?,btohqsg
I have not tried both webull and moomoo though but you can refer to their websitehttps://www.moomoo.com/sg/support/topic5_142on how to transfer stocks from other brokers to Moomoo. Coz I have accounts in IBKR  so I’m planning to move it there instead.,btohqsg
Considering it's on SingTel's network it's an easy yes. On top of that  as a ZYM user  I would also say yes. Ported over from VIVIFI and it was quite seamless  they provide a temp number while they process the porting request.You can also watch@kelvintaninvest's video to see his testing and review.,btohqsg
Do you think vivifi would be better than ZYM ?,btohqsg
All comes down to how much you're paying that's all,btohqsg
But is the network smooth and good during the usage period?,btohqsg
I won’t be surprised if interactive brokers go this route soon too,btohqsg
They are all on SingTel's network lol,btohqsg
If that's the case  then will consider to move to other reputable broker 😂,btohqsg
I think the regulatory requirements a broker needs to fulfill based on mas requirements might be too cumbersome to be worthwhile for retail investors.,btohqsg
I would be cautious of moo moo and tiger too. Imagine u setup a long term Dca plan and they close shop on u.,btohqsg
which is why I have not explore these 2 brokers for now.. for a short term trading  it could be possible to go for these 2 brokers. But long term wise  will need to consider for the broker's reputation of the business,btohqsg
Hi all gurus  Any nice promo ongoing for account opening for ocbc or uob?,btohqsg
Why port over from Singtel to Singtel?,btohqsg
All comes down to how much you're paying that's all,btohqsg
I believe Singapore registered brokers all need to provide insurance up to $500k. But do check before putting large sum of $,btohqsg
I am not compliance expert.But I believe it is all boiling down to the extra requirements whether product suitability or customer protection that mas requires of retail clients that probably accredited investors can be exempted from.,btohqsg
"TD Ameritrade for Singapore is soon to be exclusive to only ""Accredited Investors""  those who are affected  please watch Kel Vin's video on it.https://youtu.be/3T5avpv_RCk",btohqsg
"Accredited Investor (AI) has less regulatory protection from what I read last time as you already ""claimed/agreed"" that you are well verse with financial products  and rich enough  so you don't require protections like other less financial incline investor.And banks can sell you all kinds of risky financial products which they are Not allowed to sell to non AI because AI can take higher risk.. lol",btohqsg

I remember the answer of this query is stated in the UOB One TnC.You may google “uob one bonus tnc” to have a look. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
If you talking about the 3x GIRO bill payment for uob one account bonus interest  need to submit interbank GIRO form and successful auto GIRO deduction. Must easier to just do salary crediting as discussed above.insurance charged to uob one/evol/lady/debit count to min spend for uob one account $500 card spend for bonus interest but dun count to card rebate. Investment not counted to card spend,btohqsg
It’s a bit of spillover. But uob visa signature for 4mpd on $2k. Balance $600 wasted but if u can  use uob ppv for the $600.Else uob lady family category to take all $2.6k but u might be wasting a precious category in my view.,btohqsg
Be careful. Make sure u observe which payment terminal they use. Make sure not a dedicated terminal for vouchers where possible. If can  pay at a normal grocery checkout although $2.6k likely a manager will serve u.,btohqsg
Oh if it's at the customer service counter  it will be different?,btohqsg
Heard of rumours / possibilities and I won’t risk it so I always Topup my ntuc gift card while paying for groceries at normal groceries checkout cashiers.,btohqsg

for dbs/posb card can check mcc via dbs website chatbot. For other banks need to contact the bank ask CSO to check,btohqsg
It won’t print the mcc code on the Fairprice receipt at the point after payment. If it is mcc 6540  the receipt is very loooong type n just for gift card or top up or physical vouchers. Receipt for groceries is the usual one that you get.If you want to be sure  call CSO..,btohqsg

OK kinda dumb qnsI currently have 3 miles card + 1 cashback card which is uob one (mainly because I use grab a lot + use for my utility payment+ shoppee+ groceries as well)The 3 miles card are1. uob lady solitaire for dining/entertainment kiv travel when I want to but flight tickets/book hotels2. Citi rewards for online spendingAnd3. citi premier miles for overseas spending (yes I know there are cards with better miles earn rate but I like miles that don't expire)Is it worth it to get hsbc revolution for big ticket purchases that dont fulfill the uob one or uob lady criteria? The categories are quite wide and there's no annual fee or minimum spendOr would dbs women's card card be better since there's amaze to pair with?But I barely hit the 1k spending a mth for citi rewards and 2k spending for uob one...,btohqsg
Oh wait dbs women doesn't credit amaze oops,btohqsg
Then I guess its just whether hsbc revolution is worth getting,btohqsg
uob lady (dining category)  hsbc revolution  uob ppv  dbs wwmc  citi cashback  uob evol etc.,btohqsg
if ur citi rewards is mastercard version  can use Amaze+crmc instead assuming the big ticket item is less than $1k?,btohqsg
Yeah hm but above 1k? Hsbc revolution is up to 2k a mth righr,btohqsg

can but at a very lousy rate,btohqsg
depends which card. Citi rewards card excludes payment via applepay in-app,btohqsg
then dbs wwmc 4mpd for max $2k for online,btohqsg
How about UOB visa metal infinite? I’m afraid it would not be counted towards the required spending for sign up rewards,btohqsg
should be ok so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
The MCC for Shopee remains the same regardless if payment is made via Apple Pay in-app or credit card right 😅 was a little lazy to manually enter card details or to add card details to the app so went with the Apple Pay option 😅,btohqsg
Does anyone here know if its possible for you to check your credif rating?,btohqsg
yes  but MCC varies depending on what u buy on Shopee,btohqsg
free if u applied new card and there is an enquiry done by the bank,btohqsg
I didnt know it will affect me  what if i have been experimenting credit cards?,btohqsg

hey folks... i m kinda curious... many ppl (if not  most ppl) use UOB ONE acct and OCBC360 as their main savings account... has anyone used SCB Bonus saver account? i believe that their account can yield like 4% interest...,btohqsg
very hard.. need insurance and investments,btohqsg
Ocbc also got those 2 requirements...,btohqsg
but ocbc has useful cards... SCB... NIL,btohqsg
i think this is the ideal case,btohqsg
so what cashback/miles do you earn from the credit card spend in SCB?u are essentially self funding your own savings interest by giving up cashback/miles on your card spend,btohqsg
Bonussaver credit card itself earns you nothing,btohqsg
eh wait.... not any SCB cards?,btohqsg
nope only if you use Bonus Saver card  although not much difference anyway since SCB doesn't have useful cards,btohqsg
oh well... guess OCBC360 and UOB ONE is the ideal case... claim both max interest,btohqsg

Curious  apart from 'delaying payment for cash flow purposes'  are the fees worth it for the potential miles? (cashback clearly not worthwhile since it's lower),btohqsg
Yes if during the promo 2.2mpd @ 2.2% fee  which is buying miles at 1c/m,btohqsg
I see.. Always been a cashback person but with income tax  property tax  insurance payments etc probably need to start considering city payall with miles. But so complicated 😭,btohqsg

Hi  anyone. I use my uob evol via cardup to pay by my rental and i also have to call to center to confirm this transaction is eligible with the rewards  but why my one account is not reflected with this spend in my min $500. Anyone can know?,btohqsg
Is not how much uob evol the speeding also eligible with uob one account?,btohqsg
by the way cardup* is in the excluded list in the TnC for uob one account $500 card spend,btohqsg
So meaning is evol is eligible  but the one account is not eligible?,btohqsg
cardup is not eligible for uob one account card spend. Spending on Uob evol is eligible to uob one account card spend only if the transactions are not excluded.,btohqsg
So the cardup is only can earn for evol rewards,btohqsg
Hope your cardup fees is less than 0.3% lol,btohqsg
But just now i have to call to center  they say this rewards may under online spend,btohqsg
July you contacted them and they said 0.3%,btohqsg
On cardup's own FAQ also said 0.3%,btohqsg
But is ok la. At least can hit the min spend with evol $600,btohqsg
At your own risk 🤷🏻‍♂️ it's not even worth using cardup on UOB EVOL unless you struggling to clock the remaining $100 to hit card min spend  i.e.  you already hit $250 online and $250 mobile contactless so both UOB One Account $500 min spending and UOB EVOL $40 cashback is already clocked.,btohqsg
Hope your rental is also $98 before fees else so the transaction after fees (assuming standard 2.6% cardup fees) is $100. Anything else you'll start losing cashback,btohqsg
Anyone knows which card earns a higher cashback rate than 0.5% abovexe.commid market rate when making foreign purchases?Example when ringgit rate onxe.comis 3.43 but when i charge to this card  after including cashback  i get 3.455 (0.75% or more higher),btohqsg

But the one account is not eligible with cardup.,btohqsg
think he meant the $500 already clocked via eligible online/mobile contactless  cardup to just clock the remaining $100 to make up $600 on evol,btohqsg

Hello newbie question  If someone does competitive tbill at 3.5% and cutoff is 4%. He gets 100%  but does he get 3.5% returns or 4% returns?,btohqsg
So for competitive bidders they either get 100% allotted or 0% based on their threshold? Does non competitive bidders get 100% allotted?,btohqsg
Yes to your first questionMaybe to your second question. Depends on total non competitive demand vs the non competitive allocation.,btohqsg
Ah ic. Based on tranche volume  so meaning that if there's more apply than 60% then will be proportioned...,btohqsg
What I don't understand is.. Why isn't there any downside to those who lowball,btohqsg
i'm not sure what is the comp vs non comp allocation but if non comp totals $500 million and total allocation to non comp is $300 million  then there will be a fixed amount given to all non comp buyers,btohqsg
there is.. the low ballers helped to drag the final cutoff yield lowerthink of it this way.. if 100% of competitive bidders put 1% yield  the cut off yield will be 1%,btohqsg
Wow.. One sink all sink. But it's even worse for those non competitive isn't it... Say for those who use cpf.. Why would they even want 1%,btohqsg

I think there is a mismatch between my CDP NRIC (am an EP holder) so it doesn't work with Singpass  but the number is correct,btohqsg
Hi  would you recommend those with Citi Premieremiles card who bought air tickets with it stick to the complimentary travel insurance from HL Assurance?,btohqsg

Try to appeal first? If not then fiancé and you both apply ladies card,btohqsg
Only u know what u did. We won’t know la.But can only say bank won’t close u for no reason one la. U must have done something against their terms and conditions.,btohqsg
Yes. But okay lah got trust card and you trip to replace revolut. Last time can get miles from them now cannot,btohqsg
Yup. Uob ban u. Still got dbs and ocbc.Just don’t repeat your Naughty behaviour until left no bank.,btohqsg
Fiance got uob lady solitare card already. So would dbs womens world card be a food alternative?,btohqsg
Yes. Shd be able to generate online links for me to make payment online,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword “Wedding card” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Yes I guess that's the next best alternative. Still I will probably do lady's card and DBS woman's if you already collecting miles using UOB. UOB pools the miles anyways,btohqsg
I love how you end your replies 🤣,btohqsg
Did you let other people used your bank account before?,btohqsg
