Aiyo. See engine. 5.0L v12Maybe they can put in 3.5L V6 and sell as a entry Level one?Or put in Toyota Camry engine inside.No LED 😂 budget version Toyota Century X model😜Toyota loves theXGG LED ModelG model Toyota Safety Sense,btohqsg
that will compete with their lexus line. even though they might share some same parts😂,btohqsg
they'll just create a juiced up crown instead,btohqsg
make a low spec century wouldn't be as exclusive anymore,btohqsg
it’s like merc and the e180 smh,btohqsg
do we even mention the a160 hahaha,btohqsg
but i think e180 is the worst offender,btohqsg
last time was a flex but now anyone can afford it with a higher loan,btohqsg
just like you can't make a low spec cheap rolls Royce.  their pricing will only go up no down to cater to their niche customers.,btohqsg

Used Car That Was Bought Just 10 Days Ago Burst into Flames When Parked Outside Old Airport Road Food Court - Goody Feedhttps://goodyfeed.com/secondhand-car-10-days-flames/,btohqsg
Wonder which dealer he bought it from...and that dealer sure claim innocence,btohqsg
Depends dealer got give warranty. If not is claim Insurance only right?,btohqsg
I think the buyer should file claim under lemon law,btohqsg
Hope got comprehensive insurance can claim for fire. Market value only,btohqsg
Dun know insurance will pay real mkt value or not? Quite sianz,btohqsg
While waiting for claim  still must pay the bank  if any,btohqsg
So how they determine the “mkt value”?,btohqsg
U mean the claim will take a long time to settle?,btohqsg
But confirm plus chop below market rate,btohqsg
Confirm not the inflated price of 70 000 he bought,btohqsg
Cause they have to investigate also,btohqsg
For this case idk leh  10 days still freaking new leh,btohqsg
2nd hand5 yr old car.Look like fuse box burnedNot sure under the honda recalled list of models,btohqsg
But I think fella covered by the lemon law,btohqsg
The lemon law is only up to 6 months,btohqsg
Tot only cover gearbox and engine,btohqsg
BBQ le: Honda Vezel rear-ends a motorcycle after failing to pay attention while checking for oncoming trafficWan le Wan le Wan le BBQ le~➡️ React with 😱 if you think the Honda driver really BBQ le!👉🏻 Read the full storyhere!,btohqsg
Dealer sure tai-chi to honda manufacturers problems,btohqsg
Unless is illegally modified etc  otherwise must be manufacturer Liao,btohqsg
Wonder how such cases will end up. Good for us to know also cos we will buy used car,btohqsg
that mean u need fork out another sum to buy car or be carless,btohqsg
Engine also got alot of wire,btohqsg
Most of the times  insurance will pay you,btohqsg
ppl like to mod here mod there . splice wire. . it's like a time bomb,btohqsg
But if you have LED lights inside or outside,btohqsg
Even if you have 24h running car cam,btohqsg
And do your maintenance on time,btohqsg
A good habit that I just learned is that whenever cleaning engine bay  take a look around your engine,btohqsg
Fren carcam battery pack exploded  lucky small fire  whole car stink of smoke smell,btohqsg
That would be unfair cos buyer sure buy above market value...and dealer's pocket is safe,btohqsg
All insurance for full total lost claim is always market value. And market value is always super low compare to the same spec/year/car you buy in the used market,btohqsg
What buyer paid definitely includes dealer's pay,btohqsg
But the whole lemon thing very,btohqsg
An article from SGCM regarding it!,btohqsg

Absolutely agree🤙🏻🔥 but will@awj_moodpick the 86/BRZ over the 997?🤔-R,btohqsg
miata is always the answer 👍🏻,btohqsg
I think for the car to burn up after a few days and not a few years it's worth the trouble and fight,btohqsg
