bought it on the idea that I might not have time to watch the future videos  and very often need to watch other youtuber's video to cross check facts.

is it worth to pay the annual fee of $588 for 35 000 miles?,btohqsg
Depends on your personal value of a milehttps://youtu.be/faKTziNGHGI,btohqsg
What you can do is copy the method from redeeming economy air ticket to surrounding country to a LONG HUAL first class or business class ticket. This method usually will give you higher value for you miles. I believe Chris would release a part 2 video of that video,btohqsg
or you can pay $88 for the upcoming course where Chris will upload more exclusive content and information about credit cards.https://youtu.be/6g1J3E7DyJQ,btohqsg
Are the strategies for cashback or miles?,btohqsg

ahhh currently it has 6 videos & about half hour of content?,btohqsg
Yes  now are the preview videos only.First course content will be out 7 Mar,btohqsg
Just wondering  because credit card TnC is always changing  will the course be updated always? In a sense there’s no completion?,btohqsg
Correct  as i mentioned in the last part of ACCM video,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGhsbc revolution card joined yr cse no cashback ? Cause it’s online payment,btohqsg
HSBC Revo only awards 10x on whitelist categories,btohqsg

Sometimes the best lessons were learnt from mistakes because you remember it so hard that you will not do it again  so yeah,btohqsg
Agree ! Every cents count now so really need to maximise every cashback,btohqsg

https://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/promotions/latest-promotions/accounts/casa-sep22-promo.htmlWhat's the catch of CIMB StarSaver Account ? thanks!,btohqsg
Is there a gauge of what kind of non public info there will be?,btohqsg
One good example is how to use up your grabpay 30k limit before 4 apr nerf,btohqsg
CIMB Starsaver not much catch  but you can get better returns with others bank accounts  if you want fuss free SIF Gosaver give higher returns  but if you wanna work a bit  HSBC EGA  Maybank iSavvy  SCB Esaver give better returns,btohqsg
Will there be like a private telegram or whatsapp group for all those members to chat on those course material for further clarification ?,btohqsg

What’s the best way to pay income tax now?,btohqsg
Any tax guru here? Can we claim motor vehicle license for course fee relief?,btohqsg
If can claim I will claim my class 2A upgrade fees...,btohqsg
I would say just pay in instalments.. in the meantime just keep placing the money in high interest savings accts,btohqsg
Why not quickly use the amex to grab loophole b4 nerf,btohqsg
GPMC can't use at AXS anymore,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGcan I claim this for course fee relief for fy 23?,btohqsg
Use the 'Chat with IRAS' feature on pagehttps://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-reliefs-rebates-and-deductions/tax-reliefs/course-fees-relief,btohqsg
Iirc course fee relief is only for course that relate to your line of work,btohqsg
My job has lots of purchasing needs so require use of CC frequently. I would say this is strong justification for courses relevant to my employment 😆,btohqsg
Well  if iras accept this reasoning  i am not complaining,btohqsg
Well that is for next FY claims,btohqsg
Grab Card has a 2% equivalent cashback right now (for $150 spend).,btohqsg
You'd be surprised what the hnw people claim as tax relief that get approved,btohqsg
Even stuff like personal travel expenses and meals,btohqsg
this is fine  cus is reflected as accepted in IRAS website,btohqsg
I am in the miles game for sometime. I thought I knew it all but Chris always surprise me with new miles hack that I am not aware of. Have signed up the course! 😃,btohqsg
Like I said if we justify and IRAS accepts who are we to not claim?,btohqsg
but have you read the IRAS page regarding the course fee relief yet? Maybe can help answer your question,btohqsg
No like we are doing illegal stuff,btohqsg
You can try and provide us the DP,btohqsg
Yes I did. 2nd point any course  seminar  conference that is relevant to current employment,btohqsg
So what if it is gray zone SG is famous for loopholes,btohqsg
Even if they end up rejecting the $88 (or more) cost is like a few dollars more of additional tax. Just pay back,btohqsg
Any sign up bonus for these accounts pls?,btohqsg
Please lah  if im iras i also will reject base on this. But you can try then let us know in ACCM,btohqsg
How to go about this ??,btohqsg
true but if it doesnt not move you down a tax bracket I dont see the need to do it tbh 😅,btohqsg
One thing I learnt from hnw people is that they don't get rich spending money by saving every cent,btohqsg
Uob one interest cam we draw out without any incurred any with our perk benefit likes on going bonuses?,btohqsg
I just paid for the course fees  now waiting for email hahah,btohqsg
If it is there to be exploited you are very sure all hnw people are going to exploit the tax loophole,btohqsg
definitely  but they are advised by a tax advisor so they can catch loopholes easier  while there is us just digging around and trying the hard way. the sad truth,btohqsg
They can afford private accountants on retainer and probably save much more,btohqsg
They spend more to save more!,btohqsg
And i think having a business allows you to write off more things as a tax relief? correct me if i am wrong,btohqsg
I make up to $80/hr I can imagine those ppl making several hundreds or thousands per hr it is worth the cost of 5-10k per month for a private accountant,btohqsg
Hi do you know how they did it? Do I need to register a business for it to be convincing? Currently I am a full time salaried worker only dont think it is convincing to book my holiday travel expense as tax deductible expenses.,btohqsg
It is not worth doing it for a dormant company. You pay so much more in filing your tax returns and registration fee,btohqsg
I have registered a business as sole proprietorship so don't enjoy all the tax savings,btohqsg
are you also a full time salaried worker?,btohqsg
Yes it's not illegal. just need to make sure no comflict of interest with your existing company and they don't have concerns if they ever finds out.Do you file income tax under this company you registered?,btohqsg
if you choose to not register a company and collect freelance work payment under your own name as in individual  whatever income will be taxable right? so this is one benefit of registering a company?,btohqsg
Anyway I think we already sidetrack too much from CC to tax avoidance,btohqsg
ok we discuss in private. 😅,btohqsg
Maybe@ChrisHMSGcan create a tax avoidance master course to share more,btohqsg
This one is professional tax advisor already  i think need MAS license one,btohqsg
Yes definitely costs more than $88 or 888,btohqsg
These people don't easily share for free. If not their rice bowl broken,btohqsg
I cannot pay my tax and insurance anymore using grabpay. Is the best way by cardup with maybank family card?,btohqsg
Hi all  just to check if use posb app scan and pay sgqr and use live fresh cc to pay  considered online txn?,btohqsg
think that is paynow which is paid from bank account not card,btohqsg
XNAP paired with apple pay is considered mobile payment category is that right?,btohqsg
Why use cardup when u can just use fnf on axs,btohqsg
online mobile in-app (not mobile contactless),btohqsg
fnf on cardup isnt it also 0.3%?,btohqsg
ya then whats the point  might as well i just use fnf to axs where there's no cardup fees,btohqsg
yup or use other cards via Cardup.,btohqsg
HSBC revolution card 10x rewards excluded Kris+ comfort cab book. Even its stated clearly comfort transportation.,btohqsg
Ya this is one whole buggy app payment that I want to avoid using  when im in rush to book a taxi,btohqsg
Yup  guess this is not the ideal card to work with kris+ app. Plus they got serious risk of having misrepresentation of their credit card CVP.,btohqsg
Yes  then use Flashpay to pay Tax. But there is still a better way to use up GPMC. Pls do not ask me. I am fered after this $88 course  this method will be gone.,btohqsg
Where will you recommend to place deposit if balance in ocbc360 has maxed out 100 000?,btohqsg
Hi  gurus. Can cardup or ipaymy be used to pay credit card bill? I failed at use nets flashpay to pay credit card bills  want to find an alternative way to do it,btohqsg
depends what is your requirements  if fuss free can consider SIF Gosaver  GXS Bank  Maybank iSavvy and SCB Esaver. if you are willing to work a bit harder HSBC EGA ..,btohqsg
EGA interest is only for incremental balance?,btohqsg
EGA has 2 parts  1 is the bonus interest 4.55%  if you put in March-June cycle is pegged to reference month Feb. The other part is the 1% for the everyday+ which peg to previous month which you need do 2K in and 5xFAST out every 2 months,btohqsg
Hi  do you guys think now is still worth to buy dbs bank stock?,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSGu mentioned in the video you won’t discuss things that could be considered “unethical” on the courses or private telegram group. How about hacks like CC>Grab>CC ?,btohqsg
This is not considered unethical  but a loophole.Unethical is like you make XNAP payment $1000 to hawker for a $100 meal then ask for refund $900 because you keyed in one more zero,btohqsg
No doubt there is a thin line between unethical and loophole and ofte a grey area. But ask yourself  can you sleep well doing this. that will be your answer,btohqsg
Hi everyone  may I check if booking Air ticket and Hotel for overseas trip qualifies for UOB Evol online spend category?,btohqsg
One more unethical example: One particular transport turned financial services company  suddenly block payments to prepaid e-wallets without notice until someone flagged it online. The information was only distributed by online communities without official notice from the said company. So  is this unethical?,btohqsg
I never say who ah  don't speculate,btohqsg
May i know what is the base interest for hsbc EGA?,btohqsg
And to meet the criteria for spendings  does it mean i xfer $2000 from another bank account into hsbc EGA  and i make 5 $1 transfers ( 5 transactions) and transfer out the rest of the money?,btohqsg
Yup  recent update from what I read.,btohqsg
kinda shocked  711 doesn't accept amex card😂,btohqsg
yes for everyday+ just 2K in and 5 x FAST $1 out will do the trick on the 1st and 3rd month cycle,btohqsg
OCBC FD 8 months higher returns,btohqsg
Sorry  what does it mean by 1st and 3rd month cycle?,btohqsg
Since the interest rate is so low  i am wondering once i put the 2k in  can i take it out,btohqsg
if you see HSBC everyday+ promo  once you do 2K in and 5 x FAST $1 out is for 2 month period only  you will see it when you receive the sms,btohqsg
now no more  now is 3.55 for 5 mths,btohqsg
Is there a page or pdf where i can see the full info? Didnt fully understand,btohqsg
anyone knows if SC simply cash card 1.5% rebate is applicable for grab top up? tried looking at the TnCs but couldnt find any relevant,btohqsg

EGA has 2 parts  1 is the bonus interest 4.55%  if you put in March-June cycle is pegged to reference month Feb. The other part is the 1% for the everyday+ which peg to previous month which you need do 2K in and 5xFAST out every 2 months,btohqsg
idk how make use effectively for EGA there a minimum amount if you transfer out and do not want pay the fall below fee so you need have some cash sitting in,btohqsg

this topic may have already been discussed multiple times long ago  however can anyone share w me the best savings acc for fresh grad? also the tips like stacking w saving acc for more benefits (e.g uob cc  credit salary  saving acc  spending),btohqsg
Personally  I think your best bet is UOB one account. Combo it with a suitable credit card of your choice (most powerful one are UOB one/ UOB EVOL) with min spending requirement but it is easy to hit given everything is expensive nowadays  your interests could potentially be near 4%,btohqsg
In my experience  I've received sms reminders for my DBS  uob  Citi bills  email reminders for SC bills ...,btohqsg
Do you know when UOB Cesar bonus interest?,btohqsg
You refer to the bonus interest that makes it max effective 5%? 2nd of month,btohqsg
Ps why isit not every month but every alternate month?,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  what credit card to use to pay for your ACCM course? I want to earn 4mpd HEHE,btohqsg
I think because only fresh fund can earn bonus I wonder what happen if this promotion end and it goes back to low rate,btohqsg
You likely tranfer to other bank like rhb high yield I don't know if they still have their promotion something similar,btohqsg
So alternate month to earn bonus rate,btohqsg

There is 2 way of playing for example if you are March-June cycle if your Feb is 01) March - put in all and do $2k in and 5 transfer out to get 5.55%2) April - $2k3) May - put in all and do $2k in and 5 transfer out to get 5.55%4) June - $2kOr1) March to June whole cycle  just put all on 1st March and leave it there and do $2k in and 5 transfer out on 1st March and 1st May so your first month 5.55% the rest 4.55%,btohqsg

Is there any card that can earn point when I top up my youtrip trip?,btohqsg
Ya plus if you use as savings account  you still get 1.5%+ pa interest. Imagine you go overseas allocating substantial amount of money to spend  each day still getting some interest compared to zero. Not that bad aye.,btohqsg
Wait long long most of non cc let u earned point from top up the era of double triple tip is gone,btohqsg
but the savings can get higher interest in other banks. Think the main reasom for using Trust card for overseas spend is to clock minimum spend for higher rebate at fairprice group merchants,btohqsg
I mean since there's no minimum and fall below fees  you can just park certain amount in Trust Account while you're in holidays. During that period when you're overseas  you won't lose out as much on interest compared to YouTrip.Also  after the trip  if you really want more interest elsewhere  just transfer the money back to your preferred account.,btohqsg
"I don't think during holidays you really want to still think about how much to topup to YouTrip just to minimize the ""leftover"" balance that can't be cashed out ba.You're there to enjoy  not to think about these dollars and cents lol I hope",btohqsg

RE: HSBC EGA Mar-June PromoHSBC CSO told me if I were to top up once  eg 10k in March (0 balance in Feb)  for the promo  I will only get the 4.55%pa for March ONLY if I don’t top up again in Apr. The bonus interest is calculated on the incremental top up Amt month on month. So not possible to Top up once in March and hope to get 4.55%pa for the four months straight.It’s different from what I understood from the video so asking here. Any others called and got the same understanding?,btohqsg
$88 to learn about credit card LOL,btohqsg
The CSO told me account open in MAR  Mar is reference month. Worst,btohqsg
He was saying if I were to top up $5k more in Apr  I will get bonus interest 4.55%pa on the $5k only and not on the $10k deposited in March coz the increase in deposit ADB is $5k  compared to Feb which is zero.,btohqsg
I’m just asking coz don’t wanna only find out the truth only in Aug when the bonus int is paid lol,btohqsg
"""increase in deposit ADB for the reference month of Feb'23"". means if Feb is $0  any amount deposited after Feb will be entitled to 4.55%. this is also confirmed with the HSBC CSO when i called",btohqsg
Every HSBC cso is saying different things 😂,btohqsg

Hi  just checked my Singsaver reward status  it just indicated not eligible  anyway I can check on the reason ? Tks,btohqsg
1% is on the incremental balance wrt to previous month's  so if May's balance is same as Apr's  incremental balance $0  May only get 4.55% (1%×$0  = $0)  likewise for Jun.After promotion base interest 0.05%,btohqsg

"I want to address this issue of private vs public sharing of card strategies.Some of the critics will ask  ""why so secretive keep to paid private group only?""Let's be clear here that I have been sharing transparently the past two years with free content on YouTube Channel. And you see the consequences of nerfs after nerfs from oversharing.ACCM is literally the safe space to protect from oversharing. You may disagree on how it is operating and not purchase it (I told you all not to buy in my first sentence). But do not undermine the work that I have did in the past  current and future for credit card content  which will still continue in public space.Thanks.",btohqsg

Hello guys  I just got my citi Rewards CC. So to get 4MPD on offline retail. Have to use the physical amaze card to pay?,btohqsg
Yes. Just tag to the Citi Rewards CC.Cap is 1K 🧢,btohqsg
What about online spending? Only retail to earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Also can. Indeed for online spending on Citi Rewards alone it is 4 mpd 👍🏻👍🏻Just that the card only give 4 mpd up to 1K spend on eligible spending charged to the card lor,btohqsg
So online any category is eligible for 4mpd? Examples like private hire and Food delivery?,btohqsg
Yes. Online category for everything except the exclusions incl travel,btohqsg

Hi  one question about the DBS women's card  I got both women and world women card  are these two cards both have seperate 2k spend limit for their bonus point?,btohqsg
I remember i tried to add in apple pay before and it's didnt worked. some card cannot add to apple pay. But anyway when u want start to use amaze card  it's much easier that u can use the physical card to tap or u fill in the card detail with online purchase.,btohqsg
Amaze can only be added to Google Pay. If you're using iPhone can only tap with physical Amaze card,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I have received amaze card except for crmc so I am curious.,btohqsg
Which card do you all usually use to tagged for the fairprice app to pay in kopitiam ?,btohqsg
I use Citi rewards and HSBC revolution on my fairprice app. When paying in kopitiam I select my HSBC card  although not sure if it gets 4mpd  but I know my Citi rewards doesn't get 4mpd for kopitiam payments,btohqsg
Do HSBC revolution card get 4mpd when using it to pay insurance?,btohqsg
Insurance is excluded. You can use Maybank Platinum or BOC Family instead,btohqsg
only specific MCCs have 4mpd for offline spend.,btohqsg
Can you share some that qualify?,btohqsg
dbs woman's card only give 5× points for max $1k eligible online spend,btohqsg
Hsbc revolution card buy flight ticket ontrip.comcan get 10x point rewards?,btohqsg
Anyone notices this under UOB EVOL T&C  W.e.f. 1 March 2022  please be informed that transactions with the transaction description “AMAZE* TRANSIT*” will be excluded from the awarding of cashback.,btohqsg
No sure if it also applies to XNAP  as it shown as XNAP*,btohqsg
uob evol is a visa card.,btohqsg
I saw online that Trust Bank Card may work really well with the fairprice app. Unsure if it's true.,btohqsg
Extra 8% cashback for groceries and 6% for kopitiam. Min $800,btohqsg
I tagged mine to my Trust Bank CC,btohqsg
Worth to apply for trust card for overseas txns if I alr have youtrip?,btohqsg
Fx spread is probably the same but trust gives 0.22% rebates for non FP transactions while you trip doesn’t give anything,btohqsg
Please correct me if I’m wrong,btohqsg
Not really.I stay near a Sheng Siong outlet and purposely bought $875 worth of Sheng Siong vouchers.Then I slowly used it for my daily grocery shopping at any Sheng Siong outlets.Now  everything I bought at Sheng Siong is at an 8% discount. Plus the vouchers never expire.,btohqsg
Is the same cashback available if I buy NTUC vouchers?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  can i ask if using instarem amaze card overseas can claim tax refund ?,btohqsg

Hi all  anyone using IBKR? Would like to know if fee will be charged if trading using margin? I mistakenly opened a trade with my margin account  had changed it back to cash account. Just wonder will this open order be charged for any margin fee?,btohqsg
Interesting xnap is under liquid pay,btohqsg
Check HSBC covered but uib one seen to be no,btohqsg
Any way to earn cashback for paying insurance??,btohqsg
No idea  never tried that before,btohqsg
I’ve done some research regarding XNAP  CRMC and Apple Pay/Google Pay.You can’t add Amaze to Apply pay. So you can only CRMC -> Apply Pay -> XNAP. After digging around it seems that only a very particular MCC fashion is eligible for 4mpd. So if you want to earn 4mpd using XNAP on iPhone  have to use other cards that gives reward on online transaction without using Amaze card like HSBC  UOB and etc.So Android users benefit this the most. You can MasterCard -> Amaze -> Google Pay -> XNAP. And you can earn your rewards include 4mpd if you using any of those card Chris mentioned.,btohqsg
Slipped off my tongue  Apple pay CRMC should not get 4 mpd on XNAP,btohqsg
Instarem amaze has no love for iPhones,btohqsg
Depends how much do you spend on hawker food. Amoy street food center has a lot merchants that accept ShopBack. So you don’t lose out much if your workplace is around the area.,btohqsg
Just say get a android for the flexibility,btohqsg
But I’m going to try something super mafan. I have a friend who just upgraded his android phone cause it has green lines on his display.I’m going to inherit his android phone  do all the Amaze  Google Pay and XNAP on that spare phone.It’s not uncommon for people to carry two phones around anyway.,btohqsg
Do we need to keep $500 in our RHB account to avoid the fall below fee and presumably get the bonus interest from last month?,btohqsg
Based on what I know  no need. But you can call their hotline to confirm again. The line is quite responsive,btohqsg
On HSBC EGA  isit true that 1% rebate for Giro  applies only when Giro application is made via hardcopy  and not via online applications? Was told by HSBC Staff. So backwards one.,btohqsg
Affirm no need  my rhb saving account  less than $100 still yield interest,btohqsg
When will part 2 of the miles v cashback be out?,btohqsg
Yes.Do note Citi Cashback has a peculiar way of crediting cashback  and it is credited in blocks of $10 with a minimum of $50 each time. This means that if you spent S$800 within a single month on groceries  you would get S$64 of cashback  but only S$60 would offset your bill  leaving S$4 stuck.If you want it to be “neat”  spend S$875 or S$1 000 instead for a nice and round S$70 or S$80 to be credited towards your statement.,btohqsg
Thanks for the heads up. V much appreciated,btohqsg
Does anyone know for the UOB Evol card  what are the dates of each statement month?,btohqsg
I think HSBC EGA giro payment for tax is ending in April 2023?,btohqsg
Tink may be different for each individual  may need to call. For my one card  it's 8th. But one account starts from 1st,btohqsg
Any request after 16 Jan 2023 will not be accepted  that’s what the website says. Or am I looking at the wrong thing,btohqsg
I see  thank you to both for answering. I will check with uob cso on it.,btohqsg
no ah  no end date for everyday+ rewards,btohqsg
Related to evol  anyone knows how to covert online spending to contactless? Aka proxy like Amaze? Cos most of my spending is contactless  but half of evol needs to be online,btohqsg
Does this apply for payment of tax still?,btohqsg
what u spend on? can use say shopback pay/fave pay/fairprice app/kris+?,btohqsg
yes for giro bill payment including tax,btohqsg
Ok I go check again thanks!,btohqsg
Icic.. Evol need 50% contactless spending like Google pay  and 50% online spending like shopee  Amazon shopping.Got it. Means using favepay  Shopback pay etc  will convert spending to online spend?Tks tks,btohqsg
Makes sense. I applied EGA in Feb  the hsbc staff told me that are eGiro no longer eligible for 1% rebatw,btohqsg
everyday+ rewards still working  1% cashback for GIRO bill payments,btohqsg
Hi everyone  wanted to ask is the liquid pay still useful to make payment? As xnap is replacing it right?,btohqsg
Xnap has already replaced LiquidPay so the LiquidPay app is useless now,btohqsg
Good thing about Xnap for iPhone users is that iPhone users can pay at hawker stalls with Maybank cards  while Android users can't,btohqsg
Does instarem amaze + CRMC work for private clinics as well? Since it works for public hospitals & specialist clinics,btohqsg
just use and hope it is mcc 5814 not 6012,btohqsg
Hi  to confirm  does CRMC linked to XNAP give you 4 miles per dollar for payment?,btohqsg
haha okay  was trying to find out but can't seem to check,btohqsg
no  cos online via googlepay/applepay get at most 0.4mpd. for android can use amaze+crmc via googlepay on xnap,btohqsg
Didn't notice how I maximized bonus 9000 points in 4 days after my statement. I need to find an alternative for my crmc till the next statement haha,btohqsg
Hey gurus  quick question: can I still get 10x points for HSBC revolution if I pay using installments? As long as spends within 1k. Thanks,btohqsg
To add on example you made purchase of $1000 with installment. Qualifying during the month is $1000. Subsequent monthly installment not qualifying.,btohqsg
Hihi all  could anyone advise on best corporate credit card?,btohqsg
Minimum of $50 each time.May I know what it means? You can't case out if your Cashback amount is less than $50?Does it apply for other Citi cards too?,btohqsg
For citi cashback. Doesn't apply for citi cashback+,btohqsg
Best website to buy flight tickets? Anyone used before cheaptickets?,btohqsg
Fyi. OCBC 360 interest have been credited,btohqsg
Anyone knows when OCBC allows online purchase of Tbills using CPF OA,btohqsg
Back to my earlier example  it does not quite matter if you are going to continually use the card since the S$4 will add to your future earned cashback to be credited towards future statements (i.e. in another block of S$50).However  I use a Citibank cashback card only for grocery purposes and it will take me many months to consume my vouchers. I prefer to get all my cash back in one go.For Fairprice vouchers  it is better to get their gift card than the physical vouchers; as it is more convenient to use.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGis there any referral for XNAP??,btohqsg
Can use OCBC titanium or HSBC revo cards for XNAP? Which is better?,btohqsg
"Generally is there a ""better"" option  moneysmart vs singsaver?",btohqsg
Singsaver generally gives better gifts  while moneysmart is more consistent at automatically giving gifts once conditions are fufilled without chasing their customer service,btohqsg
I see. Odd to hear that about moneysmart when I didn’t get my reward when I applied for my UOB One through them 😅But thanks for explaining!,btohqsg
For EGA  the montly $2k has to stay in the account?,btohqsg

Any best card to topup shoppeepay?,btohqsg
mcc 6540  think only uob amex  amex tcb and amex highflyer awards but may not be enough to cover the 2% fee.,btohqsg
Hmm  how do you find out the MCC ?,btohqsg
May i ask for tbill bought under ocbc if it matures it will be deposited back into the same account right,btohqsg
Seem still best to use paynow topup if coupon rebates more?,btohqsg
Why not? Your receipt is oversea’s.,btohqsg

If I use CRMC+Amaze > google pay > Xnap to pay for dining. I earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
