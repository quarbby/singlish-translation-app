I'm shocked that he's so famous though,btohqsg
Uh he grew up in a church,btohqsg
Then one of my friends was also from ghe church and so was acquainted with him,btohqsg
GOT THE LIGHTUP ONE ALSO UK,btohqsg
I GOT THIS FROM THE OKINAWA AQUARIUM THO,btohqsg
minr was from a lucky draw,btohqsg
but someone got a life size dolphin,btohqsg
"I mean if he hands out flyers on the train to strangers telling you to ""REPENT NOW!""  I'm sure he will become famous",btohqsg
you meant the guy who evangelises in public right,btohqsg
Those 2 are the most famous asr students,btohqsg
Idk if he evangelises in public but I only know one guy who does that,btohqsg
Lol everytime someone uses my username i feel sad. I wonder why,btohqsg
My friend said he evangelised his math teacher,btohqsg
Ye sure sounds like the guy I know,btohqsg
I think Christianity among youth growing q fast lol,btohqsg
Suddenly so many people ik go youth church,btohqsg
but that guy prob drives more ppl away from christianity,btohqsg
It was really big in my school in liek early 2018,btohqsg
Im from Christian sec sch. So many people converted haha,btohqsg
I thot u talking abt the joseph prince one,btohqsg
Hes one of the richest pastors in the world rite,btohqsg
That one is a little weird also,btohqsg
Buddhism in sg is prob gonna be much less dominant,btohqsg

So you in the uni group now?,btohqsg
Meh it's probably better than artow,btohqsg
Everyone I know from Dare hates arrow,btohqsg
Idk what it's called after that,btohqsg

I only go chc if my Cher invite me,btohqsg
Meetups and events to have fun,btohqsg
I heard that NCC is dang fun,btohqsg
My sec sch make us sing christian song every week haha...,btohqsg
My school song was about praising the Lord,btohqsg
One of the few i actually liked,btohqsg
I used to play worship songs for my cca,btohqsg
No my sch make us sing,btohqsg
Every week 30 mins of singing and listening to christian stories,btohqsg
I miss my school's chapel tbh,btohqsg
If we sleep they will force us awake,btohqsg
Could always sneak out with my friend,btohqsg
is andergoon and evangelist guy the same guy,btohqsg
Wat do y'all do on ur bday,btohqsg
Idk but I don't think there are many hardcore evangelists in ASR,btohqsg
Cry that i am 1 year older,btohqsg
My friend said the guys math teachee got converted,btohqsg
Friends always say I should visit Clarke quay for a change :(,btohqsg
At least u have friends :/,btohqsg
I admire the guy's skin tbh,btohqsg
asr not even elite jc but got andergoon loves it so muh,btohqsg
I mean tbh I heard that it's pretty good,btohqsg
I mean dont have to be elite to like it,btohqsg
Like the faculties are really solid,btohqsg
active guy on reddit and ig,btohqsg
And plus they really maximise the studenf's potential,btohqsg
oh so this the double agent,btohqsg
Yea but tbh i think he kinda fanboys over asr a bit too much,btohqsg
Like school loyalty is one thing,btohqsg
now i cant find both prifiles,btohqsg
But being so obessively proud of your school is another,btohqsg
Dont make the sch ur entire identity,btohqsg
When he leaves is he gonna be called nsgoon,btohqsg
he might already be gone haha,btohqsg
Yea but tbh i never see anyone love their sch so much,btohqsg
maybe andergoon impacted him a lot?,btohqsg
we nvr know cus we all online xD,btohqsg
hmm ya lor maybe if we met him in real life his diff? But we nvr know la,btohqsg
In some ways i guess its better than a lot of people constantly flaming their sch,btohqsg
Nice to have some form of positivity,btohqsg
asr at least still have both sides,btohqsg
I think all schs got students flame their sch,btohqsg
no one in cj liks cj,btohqsg
I think he means teachers who mainly teaches pw,btohqsg
I thot they say cj art q good,btohqsg
maybe those who ik all sci kids,btohqsg
Who knows maybe becus of him  asr become 4 pointer jc,btohqsg

CNA: City Harvest Church: A timeline of Singapore's biggest case in misuse of charitable funds.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/city-harvest-church-kong-hee-a-timeline-of-the-largest-case-867391,btohqsg
If someone were to  made a mistake once  will you just have a bad impression on him/her and stop talking to him/her?,btohqsg
It would depend on the mistake and how they act after knowing that they have committed the mistake.,btohqsg
most ppl wld jus say yeah but then im a vv sentimental person so like the moment i know someone as a friend  idw to lose that connection. ever.,btohqsg
Mistake : scamming people money and the act is : learn from their mistake.,btohqsg
If they repent upon their mistake  it's only merciful if we give them a second chance.Yet if they repeat all the time  you can choose to be by their side to help them or you can choose to wish the best for them and bid them farewell without any animosity towards them.,btohqsg
I consider it a good thing howeverr,btohqsg
omg i heard of this church,btohqsg
its q famous but isnt it not notorious,btohqsg
if im not wrong^ CHC goers dont attack me thanks,btohqsg
hogc is good whot i thto,btohqsg
