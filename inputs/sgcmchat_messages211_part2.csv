These have been here for a couple months alr  I saw them when i went to buy lunch lmaooo,btohqsg
the car dealer next to it gave me free ice cream and cotton candy,btohqsg
I go there for skewers or gym,btohqsg
No other skewer places there kek,btohqsg
chey ima steal all the ice cream and cotton candy,btohqsg
imo this trim removed 12 cylindri looks nicer,btohqsg
for some reason the headlights look cursed now,btohqsg
bro its just a ferarri gr86,btohqsg
GTA ahh car(i dont play gta),btohqsg
well got wtv tf this is,btohqsg
cooked better sure but its still ass,btohqsg
unless the w1 look like this,btohqsg
designed by one of the guys from jecserver,btohqsg
the senna should've been the halo car imo,btohqsg
I just dig the aero wing ngl,btohqsg
True the Senna does look better,btohqsg
Lets just hope Porsche cooks better to complete the new holy trinity,btohqsg
i think the halo trinity is gtr r34  supra and hellcat üôèüèªüôèüèª jdm legends,btohqsg
the new generation of cars don‚Äôt look too good at all;with some exceptions such as the prius & crownkeep your expectations low & you will be happy üòÇ,btohqsg
They just dont make them like they used to anymore,btohqsg
no i wouldn‚Äôt use this saying often,btohqsg
i‚Äôm more of disappointed a lot of newer cars don‚Äôt follow the design cues of it‚Äôs predeccesor or in general  it‚Äôs not in style for those brands,btohqsg
biggest example being;FK vs FLGK vs GR,btohqsg
Thats what the saying means  no?,btohqsg
i‚Äôm just saying i won‚Äôt use the phrase often,btohqsg
the FL & the GR is so‚Ä¶ bland?doesn‚Äôt look as fierce  just boring in a way,btohqsg
Newer generation cars more and more less aggressive look / design from what i see although there are some exception,btohqsg
i would just put it as bland / boring,btohqsg
how does a prius look better than a honda fit? you tell me,btohqsg
The newer AMG/Mseries is getting out of hand,btohqsg
G8x still ok after bodykit only,btohqsg
disagree  the G8x looks fine out of factory,btohqsg
Still prefer the f8x kinda look iyk what I mean,btohqsg
i never bothered to look at AMG lol,btohqsg
The newer generation cars are moving too fast looks to futuristic still prefer the early 21st century kinda look,btohqsg
well it‚Äôs not exactly futuristic when we‚Äôre living in this generation?,btohqsg
i mean they‚Äôve been aiming for this design for a long time,btohqsg
I know but I'm the kinda of guy that's still prefer the normal cluster rather then full digital,btohqsg
it‚Äôs just a product of time,btohqsg
the S2000 digital cluster & AE86 cluster is too nice to say no to,btohqsg
analog clusters are definitely here to stay though so‚Ä¶ yay,btohqsg
also the CN7 analog clusters look kinda bad so just get the digital üëçüèº,btohqsg
Yes I'm refering to analog (normal cluster),btohqsg
Pardon If I phrase it wrongly or confusingly,btohqsg
but anyways i have no problems with these cars honestly,btohqsg
cos i would never buy a new ferrari even if i had the money üòÇ,btohqsg
it comes back to the question for these modern cars;can you afford one?,btohqsg
you can afford a G8x and a ferrari?,btohqsg
Can is can but still prefer f8x,btohqsg
i think your obd2 port need to replug your lufi,btohqsg
