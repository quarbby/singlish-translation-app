A quick recap of what happened in the US election overnight:Mr Joe Biden is to be elected as the next US president after winning the battleground state of Pennsylvania ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://str.sg/JL58Mr Donald Trump's aides say he has refused to acknowledge yet that the race was over  maintaining his accusation that Democrats had stolen victory from him ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://str.sg/JL5XBeating Mr Trump is just the first of many hurdles for Mr Joe Biden ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://str.sg/JL5Büá∫üá∏ The latest updates on the election:https://str.sg/USelections-live-blog,btohqsg
Already Guess Liao  if Trump wins first instance  stock market rah rah and stablise quickly but now he lost he will not let things rest .. stock market maybe havoc .... let‚Äôs see next few days just peace before storm. My heart pik pik pok pok,btohqsg
What will happen to STI singapore market ?????? Any experts here can advise please ?,btohqsg
Now the market is very short term,btohqsg
We can think Long term until the Real president is sworn in next Jan,btohqsg
expecting sell on news start of this week then rebound as institutions rebalance their portfolios in anticipation of Biden administration,btohqsg
If Long term u must resist not to look at stock price everyday   else the heart need cpr a few times üòù,btohqsg
What about GKE? Saw got large volume buy in past 1-2 days..,btohqsg
For short run. Its good for asia,btohqsg
But long run. Might be very bad,btohqsg
Hopefully this Biden can stop the virus.,btohqsg
Yea  everything big countries has to take charge and handle well first,btohqsg
For JT  best is take advice from@alphie888.He‚Äôs the biggest holder here in the group I‚Äôm sure. He picked and went in 0.044 Region   4000 000 shares then and probably more as he averaged up along the way.So far almost all who played JT are in the money. BBs have been very very generous already.So  what do you think they will do now with so much more retailer interest in this counter now. ?Only time will tell.,btohqsg
haha i went in 0.069 with 500k shares. but sold liao. den i went in at 0.120 again lol,btohqsg
Initially  I see many people like rooting for trump thinking it‚Äôs better for the market ?But many like changing tune now that market is green and bullish.Then if market suddenly red  then think Biden is bad for market.How do one make up one mind and stick by their own principles and beliefs,btohqsg
cos the funds were stucked at cement,btohqsg
No leh  he plan to use his 1m to make 4m.,btohqsg
I think biden won is good,btohqsg
At least he won anyhow talk,btohqsg
He's the men went through alot that we never know,btohqsg
Why talk about wealth when u don't have life ?,btohqsg
