yes we have none  the one you saw most likely msia plates,btohqsg
guys what‚Äôs estimated total cost for manual drivers license in sg   given that i got knowledge on driving and road laws so go for private(?),btohqsg
I think if you know your stuff can finish around/under 2k,btohqsg
under 2k ah    est how long overall,btohqsg
but usually regular ppl spend about 2.5 up to 3+ sometimes,btohqsg
yeah that‚Äôs what i heard   but they go sch and stuff,btohqsg
must see waiting times one bro,btohqsg
average agar agar how long eh  or for u how long u took,btohqsg
I also go cdc.. finish 2k/- le,btohqsg
I think nowadays ppl take about 4 - 7months? is really based on you one,btohqsg
got ppl who spend years taking license also,btohqsg
yeah cuz i hear they keep failing haha,btohqsg
okay thank you so much gang,btohqsg
pm u the link to a chat where you can ask all your license related qns bro,btohqsg
If you can pass 1st time  6 months can settle from BTT all the way to final practical,btohqsg
But usually majority is pass on 2nd or 3rd times esp for Class 3,btohqsg
Time may be longer now since most of the private instructors are old and retired now so the schools are jam packed,btohqsg
I usually tell people when u in NS  that is best time to get licence because u are free AF,btohqsg
Or at least take BTT which is you just buy the little book with all the questions and just mug like O level 10 years series,btohqsg
BTT is valid for life so you can always anytime after that start your actual lessons,btohqsg
ask the government ‚ùåask Soran Pryde ‚úÖ,btohqsg
Yepp  next time we got any and about driving test we can ask him liao,btohqsg
Driving licence is the cheapest life upgrade,btohqsg
At least if you out of job  you can drive taxi or grab as an option,btohqsg
Some money always better than no money,btohqsg
is it easy to get into grab,btohqsg
Who can apply?Singapore citizens aged 30 years old and above  withA valid Class 3 or 3A licenceMinimum 1 year driving experienceLess than 18 demerit points (DIPS) accumulatedIf you‚Äôre a PR or aged below 30  you may sign up as a GrabHitch driver-partner  or delivery-partner.,btohqsg
Basically for both taxi and grab  u have to be 30 years and above,btohqsg
The min of of 30 for PHV driver is a fairly new requirement  it has always been 30 for taxiMany of the rules and requirement for PHV drivers were put in place because taxi driver and company whine and moan and bitch,btohqsg
Ans of course because one taxi company belong to cheng hu,btohqsg
You know why things happen la,btohqsg
Taxi driver always have the min age of 30 and taxi company they buy taxi  COE is 8 years cannot renew,btohqsg
So Uber and later Grab come along and don't have to play by these rules. The driver no min age and car rental companies all buy 8 or 9 year old junkers for cheap  fix them up a bit and rent them out to driver and run them until COE expiry at 10 years (some even go and renew because why not  can rent out some more to get back the money spent on renew COE),btohqsg
Of course taxi driver and company not happy lol,btohqsg
my guy helped me with overseas study and then i see this üò≠,btohqsg
hearsay its coming to sg soon,btohqsg
no need hide plate right its the dealer unit lmfao,btohqsg
and thats how our coe is partially fucked,btohqsg
@dorifto_liniehahaha we almost bang tht car,btohqsg
Ya pretty much.Taxi COE was taken out of the bidding in 2012  but PHV still use normal car COE,btohqsg
When you are using the car as a business tool for profit  you dare to bid high because you can always cover back by renting it out at higher rate or you just pick up more fares (if it's ur own car),btohqsg
Anyway this year cheng hu try to release more COE to lower it abit because GE2025,btohqsg
The last thing cheng hu wants is oppo party use high COE prices as an attack point against them lol,btohqsg
Also buys them time to find a more permanent solution,btohqsg
