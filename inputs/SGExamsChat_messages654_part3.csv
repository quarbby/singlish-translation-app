$3k is now a low wage,btohqsg
Why the LifeSG credits given out so late wth,btohqsg
it's time to increase my fees further ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg

$3.3k was starting pay for 1st class honours engineers in private companies,btohqsg

I had a chance of EC for 770k  which would have ballooned to 1.5m,btohqsg
but I went for HDB which is at most 580k ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
then again  give and take  the stress level of paying for the EC would have been different,btohqsg
I probably would have loved my job and not quit,btohqsg
770k is about 10+ yrs fresh grad income?,btohqsg
the only I'm lucky was I move in with in laws and rent out the flat. That rental plus dividend income enough to pay for all expenses at the moment,btohqsg
so I can save my work income for now  at least for 2024  to buy the next car in 2025,btohqsg
factoring in 13 month + bonus + employer cpf,btohqsg
