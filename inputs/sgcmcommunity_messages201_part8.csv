I doubt even if opposition take over  they can make much difference. Only way is to make singaporean poor again since up transport choices doesn’t curb demand. 😂,btohqsg
How can they control supply and demand?,btohqsg
actually no need to make sporean poor la. the coe thing is mainly due to policies,btohqsg
release the ABSD  let the papa and mama can invest their retirement fund to buy property themselves,btohqsg

is the quotas  they allocate number of quotas. They can control the quotas,btohqsg

By 2030  majority of the lines r up,btohqsg
even if COE is 1dollar  the quotas is fixed,btohqsg
They r going to make COE explode so u r forced to take public,btohqsg
2025 onwards the COE is going to rocket,btohqsg
Actually it’s obvious LTA wants to keep prices stable at around 100k,btohqsg
Using future quota so price won’t suddenly drop with excess,btohqsg
