Y‚Äôall 2020 a levels or this year a levels?,btohqsg
2018 2019 and now 2020 again,btohqsg
A lot of people here are on the older side,btohqsg
But there are some A Levels kids too,btohqsg
Later when got a levels cfm the number of the a levels kids here will exponentially increase,btohqsg
We always get a spike in traffic near National exams,btohqsg
And then 90% of them leave after that,btohqsg
And a level result release also,btohqsg
Lots also join and just exist too,btohqsg
That‚Äôs how we have 2000 members,btohqsg
Cuz I struggling with Chem and bio and here good to ask qns,btohqsg
But Chem and bio still B anyways,btohqsg
FYI our A Levels questions corner is at@sgexamsstudiesas,btohqsg
This group is mainly for talking cock,btohqsg
Ull seldom get help for bio tho,btohqsg
Our resident bio god is mia,btohqsg
The only things that are hard to get help for here are the humanities,btohqsg
Those who are good at it probably never uses these groups,btohqsg
Or they come to these groups to answer questions to kill time,btohqsg
Do you mean to say  math ppl fking bored,btohqsg
I just dw my brain to rot in ns,btohqsg
I heard this year H2 math they took out co & regre,btohqsg
Vectors every year they set 15-20 marks leh,btohqsg
3 more co & reg qns üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
My year they asked us draw scatter plot on graph paper,btohqsg
I dun even rmb my year‚Äôs co & reg qn,btohqsg
Complex now not much to troll,btohqsg
No more loci/ de movire theorem,btohqsg
I was confident in my complex until i did that ques,btohqsg
Ya they should take out vectors. Liddat no standard real number line  all work with fking abstract non-vectors material.,btohqsg
Now i have ptsd when i see ‚Äúi‚Äù,btohqsg
Eh no they took our paper,btohqsg
I propose we all learn Magmas and Groupoids for JC students,btohqsg
Its ok u wont need to touch complex numbers in uni unless u do eee,btohqsg
Eng maths will have it again i think,btohqsg
But not too intense unlike the one in electrical engine,btohqsg
Complex numbers is the complete number system,btohqsg
It was a w a twist,btohqsg
I was kinda thinking about imaginary numbers,btohqsg
This statement feels like it's throwing pure math students under the bus because they don't exist,btohqsg
Technically real numbers are complex numbers,btohqsg
Ok i forgot about pure math,btohqsg
Imagine anyone wanting to do maths,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt SEAB say they wanted math to gear more towards real life application,btohqsg
How dafuq they gonna apply imaginary numbers to real life,btohqsg
Okay time to increase my IQ,btohqsg
The type of qns are silly,btohqsg
Also  some differential equations require complex to solve,btohqsg
John has 5i apples and Mary has 9i+10 apples,btohqsg
2018 h2 math had it too lmao,btohqsg
