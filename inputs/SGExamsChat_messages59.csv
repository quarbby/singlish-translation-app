text,group
I’m not good with pungent foods,btohqsg
Might I suggest sharp cheddar and mozzarella,btohqsg
None of that square cheese bullshit pls,btohqsg
I don’t think it’ll melt too well tho,btohqsg
what if i bought a block of cheese and left it on the stove,btohqsg
Uty really  it just needs to not separate and melt together nicely,btohqsg
h u r h u r h u r,btohqsg
If you add citrus zest at the end it might be quite interesting as well,btohqsg
I can’t read Chinese so I have no idea what u just said,btohqsg
It might work if you’re leaning more spicy kind,btohqsg
Yeah that’s why I said at the end,btohqsg
wont it be very weird KSKSKS,btohqsg
So it doesn’t mix too much and separate the fats,btohqsg
That one made me physically cringe,btohqsg
But not just any pizza  I want those fancy kinds that are light and non greasy to eat,btohqsg
Light tomato base with cheese and prosciutto and rock melon ok top,btohqsg
zest peel and some juice or etv,btohqsg
so u mean pizza with lots of cocaine,btohqsg
nabei i hongry now thanks guys,btohqsg
What if I don't mind being added?,btohqsg
Guys just asking  anyone here taking film in poly or uni?,btohqsg
How do y'all normally get actors?,btohqsg
Your profiles have opposite vibes  it’s so entertaining to seek y’all talk to each other 😂,btohqsg
I’m not from film but I’m pretty sure you just ask around in ur school/class/club,btohqsg
Cool! Thanks  I'm actually interested in acting but still in JC,btohqsg
Last time I found a request from a mutual friend  that’s how I know this,btohqsg
basically my idea is that there isn't an official platform for actors and filmmakers in SG to find no-pay mutuals easily,btohqsg
Then ppl resort to finding friends who are unwilling haha,btohqsg
was that a freaking recipe or smtg,btohqsg
Sounds like you are also going to set up a new SG telegram group,btohqsg
huh me? I wasn't exactly gonna do it but since u mentioned,btohqsg
Are you certain there’s no other group for this though,btohqsg
Seems like a pretty common kind of hobby,btohqsg
inb4 sgfilm is taken by busy student,btohqsg
if got such a grp can intro pls lol,btohqsg
Okay so I tried global search and found a few  but its like really lacking... largest grp has 16 members,btohqsg
So you’re saying you’re actly in Linboyz FB group? Haha,btohqsg
I’m curious  why interested in setting up group in Tele tho  don’t you think tele functions don’t really suit film/acting hobby grp?,btohqsg
tbh was just asking here for folks who want actors then suddenly got suggestion of group haha,btohqsg
can create an app for it,btohqsg
like tinder but for film/acting ppl,btohqsg
Good luck whatever you do.I’ll exit this conversation.Got distracted.I have 1 overdue deadline  2 deadlines tmrw 💀,btohqsg
Reminds me of Fyre  ok bye.,btohqsg
Wtf thats the same as me,btohqsg
what has fyre anyth to do w this tho,btohqsg
yeah lol what does that have to do w fyre,btohqsg
It took me a moment to realise you were talking about the wood,btohqsg
U r a smart for getting the joke,btohqsg
Tinder (not the app) is material that starts fire,btohqsg
Top 10 things to do at home:1) avoid mental health deterioration- end of list -,btohqsg
Sir that ship has sailed even before the coronavirus,btohqsg
If he’s not addding people there’s no need to remove him,btohqsg
Anyone got tips on how to become cca leader,btohqsg
How to make a good impression for it,btohqsg
Make you look like a leader,btohqsg
Without overstepping your bounds or making you seem annoying,btohqsg
So i have to make people like me,btohqsg
Well idk anyone in my cca and cca sessions have not started,btohqsg
My first encounter with coding is in sec1,btohqsg
And also  you should contribute actively,btohqsg
hi guys I'm falling asleep at my business law module,btohqsg
Sometimes  there’s just these people who you know are gonna have a leadership position,btohqsg
What would count as too desperate for the position,btohqsg
but if you help too much people will think you have some ulterior motive,btohqsg
There’s no problem with being an admin there,btohqsg
it's a fine line I guess,btohqsg
being genuine in helping is pretty important,btohqsg
We only have a problem if the person is adding people from our group to theirs without permission,btohqsg
I woke up to 2 new chatgroups,btohqsg
I’m guessing you are added to the covid one as well,btohqsg
Any tips on how to be more likable,btohqsg
if you want to advertise at least do some proper advertisement,btohqsg
Just remind everyone to set their privacy settings so that they can’t be added to random groups,btohqsg
and not randomly adding people into the group,btohqsg
Ok well gg for me then,btohqsg
Even you have been added and left  still do it because they can readd you,btohqsg
Okay dude I know you’re the alt of the guy who came in before this morning,btohqsg
No need to stir shit here now,btohqsg
Plus what do you even want us to do,btohqsg
I for one prefer to be a follower,btohqsg
Leadership is not just leading others,btohqsg
Hmm my friends do say im funny so thats good,btohqsg
But its cause i know my audience,btohqsg
If you can’t be funny  just be likeable,btohqsg
This one uni v common la,btohqsg
I heard jc is just student vote though,btohqsg
Unless smtg really bad like disciplinary record then the teacher prevents them from veing pres,btohqsg
My cca exco was based on the current exco’s opinions of you,btohqsg
Guess to better the cca and have the opportunity to be one,btohqsg
Not that there’s anything wrong with doing it for portfolio,btohqsg
I only barely know my.ogls in my cca,btohqsg
Yep but i cant walk in and say i want leader for that portfolio,btohqsg
I still remember my pri sch prefect presidents all candidates say they are doing it for DSA lmao,btohqsg
I think the covid thing is a bigger issue,btohqsg
A small price to pay for salvation,btohqsg
I have like 0 social skills,btohqsg
If u are not going biz its ok,btohqsg
competition is something I'm scared of tbh,btohqsg
if we help one another it's okay,btohqsg
but if we go against each other because of grades,btohqsg
Unfortunately with bell curve... that is quite unlikely,btohqsg
Even if it’s not pharm  also will have competition. Coming to University  I suddenly feel woefully inadequate.,btohqsg
prolly will have to rely on my sec sch mates,btohqsg
Well you have sgexams for help haha,btohqsg
but we can study together or smth,btohqsg
Why inadequate? are your peers like fking amazing?TBH I don't get the hype of being good at everything in life,btohqsg
Not just grades ah  like ppl are doing amazing things in life. I’m just  who me?,btohqsg
but in uni the amount of people studying in your course in sgexams is p low,btohqsg
Yea cause too small sample size,btohqsg
When I study with peers in Uni we generally study different things.If you have questions you just ask in a public class chat  the more zaikia will answer when they feel like it,btohqsg
So a 75 for f math is safe for A right,btohqsg
Whats a safe mark for h2,btohqsg
I think 70-75 is safe enough probably,btohqsg
Or since im f maths i should aim 100,btohqsg
Unless the paper is really easy,btohqsg
Never got close enough with coursemates to study with them,btohqsg
How you know? Maybe SEAB maps 100 to U,btohqsg
But I can assure you I bumbled up at least 2 questions and still got A,btohqsg
hope I can get along well w them,btohqsg
And one of them was a heavily weighted question too,btohqsg
bumbled is an interesting synonym for screwed,btohqsg
Biz class participation is damn heavy,btohqsg
So everybody will be snatching to talk,btohqsg
IDK how many your batch will have tho. If <50 you only have so few ppl to ask. If batch is big-enough even if the zaikia not doing the same mod/class they will likely know how to solve,btohqsg
Biz is toxic and useless. My non-snake biz friends were like tbh we don’t learn anything useful.,btohqsg
Cuz biz theory and biz in practice so different,btohqsg
Anyone in nus/ntu comp sci wanna share their experience,btohqsg
Then should be ok as long as yall have a same-year batch chat,btohqsg
Which is a subfield of CS,btohqsg
it is the same la actually,btohqsg
It is just like CS+ info sec specialisation,btohqsg
CS is closer to combinatorics than Info Sec closer to CS,btohqsg
Is the content the same also or ima assume infosec is more on security and compsci is generic right,btohqsg
The only mod difference between cs and infosec is just,btohqsg
Lol this is so bs cuz IRL CS != InfoSec,btohqsg
For cs with info sec specialisation,btohqsg
At least curriculum wise they are almost identical,btohqsg
Thats the only module diff or,btohqsg
He's talking about his definition of CS and not the CS curriculum that NUS teaches,btohqsg
No  this just means NUS SOC has no idea nani da fk how to teach CS/InfoSec,btohqsg
Hmmm this reminds me of that nuswhisper about WHY CS NOT LEARNING THEORY OF COMPUTING,btohqsg
That guy who complain it is not theoretical enough,btohqsg
tbh it's a legit question wad,btohqsg
How do you grad undergrad cs without knowing formally what is a thing with a tape that reads things,btohqsg
Well they have to give a balance of practical vs theoretical,btohqsg
Either ways idrc about such things,btohqsg
Get my paper and yeet out byeeee,btohqsg
I'll worry about it when i need to grad,btohqsg
For now still got 1 year,btohqsg
Bruh 1 year very short especially under COVID,btohqsg
But you stay inside longer means more debt,btohqsg
Ah so that's what you mean by extend,btohqsg
What's the benefit of extending though  isn't the merits of going out and (hopefully) finding a job albeit lower paying better than waiting 6/12 more months,btohqsg
First job pay is generically used as a predictor for final salary in life,btohqsg
Also I’m not ready for a job,btohqsg
Thats not true for accounting though,btohqsg
Ok i'm not so sure about how starting salary affects your subsequent salaries,btohqsg
Then again  while probably statistically true I don't see how 'graduating later' into a better economy helps with pay later in life?,btohqsg
First job affects everything including promotion opportunities,btohqsg
On your CV you are judged by first position,btohqsg
Are you speaking as someone that's alr in the workforce or?,btohqsg
You are also quickly judged if you are 'High Potential',btohqsg
I speaking to random strangers on a public forum,btohqsg
You can take it or leave it - you are also free to think you are so outside the mold that none of this will affect you,btohqsg
Cuz TBH  I think of what I am saying as 'true' in the statistical sense,btohqsg
So long as >50.01% of population have final pay predicted by 1st pay  it's 'ok-enough' to claim that 1st pay predicts final pay,btohqsg
Fresh grad tech 4.4k considered low tho,btohqsg
Yolo i'll worry about it when i reach that point,btohqsg
IDK sia  I can actually ask,btohqsg
TIL NTU Confessions has a Telegram Channel,btohqsg
My source says 3.5k  so 4k+ must be interesting,btohqsg
to be fair also got form class,btohqsg
thats what my math tr said,btohqsg
but he taught for 3 yrs,btohqsg
Any govt sector also got diff fch what,btohqsg
Problem with FCH Cher is that  if you stay on teaching track you will end at 8k,btohqsg
seems like being a Cher is a good career,btohqsg
If it’s about money  tutoring is even better,btohqsg
Yes but are you REALLY willing to tell people (x+y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 is wrong for 3857987395795337598759835794835893 ... times?,btohqsg
Unless u are those star tutors,btohqsg
sorry  3857987395795337598759835794835893 is an understatement  I need Knuth arrows to show how many times students can make the exact same misakes,btohqsg
Sign on also guaranteed to get uni paid for tho,btohqsg
the only prerequisite is 90 rp right,btohqsg
I don’t think you need 90 for MOE scholarship,btohqsg
And also you need to go through MOE Teaching internship,btohqsg
if we can't enter sg uni with 60 rp,btohqsg
why don't they make A lvl grading like O lvl,btohqsg
I didnt even make the cut for MOE JCTIP with my prelims,btohqsg
That’s cause you had A Levels,btohqsg
That can be considered average horh,btohqsg
And you didn’t have uni the year you got your A Levels,btohqsg
You're still going for MOE cher rite,btohqsg
Can I ask why you wanna be cher,btohqsg
Same qn  why you want to be cher?,btohqsg
Most ppl go in there eventually for the money,btohqsg
And I want to help them become good peoples,btohqsg
Is just like how ppl sign on in mindef,btohqsg
But ofc need have the passion,btohqsg
I believe most ppl have the passion,btohqsg
But ultimately is a stable career,btohqsg
The stability is still the best thing,btohqsg
I disagree  I think it's the right motivation,btohqsg
I also am keen on teaching ngl,btohqsg
On the other hand I find this motivation very unstable if untested.,btohqsg
Cos is stable  and i enjoy the process also,btohqsg
Stability and $ come hand in hand,btohqsg
Ever wondered why 5000 moe teachers quit every 5 years?,btohqsg
Find it fun to see student's reactions to weird qns,btohqsg
Ye they can hit 5 digits per month full time tuition,btohqsg
Telling people (x+y)^2 != x^2+y^2 except for fields of characteristic 2,btohqsg
But i just like the eureka feels,btohqsg
If you like academics  you should not be a teacher,btohqsg
And how u can influence their choices,btohqsg
It's called Freshman's dream so it is expected to occur even for undergrad,btohqsg
Get ur phd and become a prof,btohqsg
Because there’s no more challenging material in it for you,btohqsg
Teachers that go into the profession for this reason is !@#¥,btohqsg
I like to hear myself talk  is another reason why I’d like to teach,btohqsg
Thats why i still enjoy 'non-official teachin' aft 2 yrs,btohqsg
I wonder if u can sustain that for 20-30 years,btohqsg
You are the opposite of me,btohqsg
Prof not for everyone. You need to enter top US uni to prof in SG.Prof in nowhere-land  dunno  see luck still tho.,btohqsg
The see-luck-part especially applies for Tenure,btohqsg
His children must like him then,btohqsg
If not for the fact that you’re 1 year too old and that we never met  I’d have thought you’re Gareth.,btohqsg
LOL teachers that go into teaching for 'noble reasons' generally don't last long,btohqsg
Simply put 'noble' people die very fast,btohqsg
Worked with teachers who stayed all the way for 'noble' reasons staying put,btohqsg
Cos they are against private tuition,btohqsg
Ok I see what u mean,btohqsg
But ofc most leave i guess for private,btohqsg
yeah but met tons of them throughout sch tho,btohqsg
“I like to hear myself talk” is so Gareth. And I literally heard him say that before.,btohqsg
Prof from NIE  professor in research or professor in teaching?,btohqsg
I can hear him say that,btohqsg
I wanna be a prof too,btohqsg
teaching and research at the same time,btohqsg
yea AU is next to impossible,btohqsg
When my teaching supervisor talks about tuition to me she always made a disgust face,btohqsg
WtfMine recommends me to open one,btohqsg
idk I'm planning to get a pharmD,btohqsg
Just wait for them to reject you,btohqsg
Or accept if you are really good,btohqsg
but then being a pharmD in sg is crazily difficult,btohqsg
PharmD can do more than just prof,btohqsg
Ye true  but to some extent pay is also a motivating reason to such extent,btohqsg
I legit dk what a pharmD does other than academia,btohqsg
Shall cya become a prof next time,btohqsg
if I'm smart enough  that is,btohqsg
His day job is in BigPharma  so there's that lol,btohqsg
I quite lazy to try for anything above degree ngl,btohqsg
Why escape the challenge  be the ones on top hahaha,btohqsg
Degrees are just necessary stepping stones more than anything,btohqsg
If i had no passion i wont change courses JOOHHHNN,btohqsg
Actually i might go above degree,btohqsg
I don't remember any time I unironically believed in this,btohqsg
You were born a jaded 35 year old,btohqsg
but then it'll not be easy,btohqsg
Juz do what you want if you can afford it,btohqsg
Not many do based on my sample size,btohqsg
Pay less in what? school fees?,btohqsg
But u are paying less for lower quality lessons i guess,btohqsg
But yet the sample size i have finds that theres no difference  or better than f2f,btohqsg
NIE is kinda a dead end if u wanna teach in JC,btohqsg
I dont rly use nie teams,btohqsg
Aren’t you the one conducting the hbl,btohqsg
What's so amazing about teaching in JC,btohqsg
My teachers who went to private mainly teach JC,btohqsg
Learn what sia  throw TYS they don't learn anything,btohqsg
Is it that much higher than Pri/Sec schl?,btohqsg
This one IDGI x2. Cuz JC material is not hard by any means,btohqsg
I find sec sch more rip off LOL,btohqsg
For the teachers I doubt JC is any difficulty for them,btohqsg
But ppl dont make good use of it,btohqsg
Since they do have a degree and all,btohqsg
JC i feel that tuition is more needed,btohqsg
Ah i scolded my fren for going gp tuition,btohqsg
Is something u can score well on ur own,btohqsg
I also considered doing GP also,btohqsg
But theres 2 simple tricks to score at least a B,btohqsg
TBH this isn't 'good advice' imo. Just don't go for bad tuition,btohqsg
Theres a template sheet to memorise how to answer SAQ qns,btohqsg
sharing is for the greater good,btohqsg
Math tuition is the most time wasting one,btohqsg
Later ppl teaching gp tuition gonna defame me,btohqsg
It's hard to properly teach math,btohqsg
I rmb going for math tuition for 2 months,btohqsg
Only to realise i was a fkin dumbass,btohqsg
Your definition of proper and his definition,btohqsg
I was thrown exam papers to do for the whole lesson duration,btohqsg
How else do you get A in both FM and H2M and not have any fundamentals in mathematics,btohqsg
Which i could simply just do on my own,btohqsg
So i just pon after 2 months,btohqsg
And self learn the whole syllabus again,btohqsg
I did that in 5 minutes,btohqsg
Donkin probably wants the kids to construct the real numbers,btohqsg
Sometimes in JC shag cannot think,btohqsg
Fk yes. It's not undoable. The 'biggest' jump is telling people what is 'Cauchy',btohqsg
But ye if ppl go tuition for sciences  maths can understand,btohqsg
If u only do questions in lessons,btohqsg
lol I can’t think anyways  can’t relate 😝,btohqsg
This should be given as homework instead,btohqsg
I mean if people can understand countable infinities they aren't that far from rationals/reals constructions.,btohqsg
The old teachers are the worst,btohqsg
The only go jc tutors i had in my sch were the econs teachers,btohqsg
Even so  they are toxic af,btohqsg
Cause they don’t give a crap any more,btohqsg
Reminds me of what my Chem teaching supervisor said,btohqsg
Imagine going to tuition just for EC,btohqsg
If they’re not interested in the subject  make them interested in you so that they will study for you,btohqsg
I just watched shokugeki as motivation to do well for A levels,btohqsg
"""I will take the first seat""",btohqsg
Geog content heavy tho. If dun want study too much Econs easier,btohqsg
Well was a bio student  so no harm done,btohqsg
And true  i barely touched my econs notes  until it was closer to A lvls,btohqsg
If want to study even less then take Lit,btohqsg
H1 Lit? Is it open book?,btohqsg
Lit is open book cause they don’t want u to focus on memorising,btohqsg
Thats why i nvr believed in studying for econs cos is very real life application based,btohqsg
Lit is the most woke subject,btohqsg
Cannot be only when u enter JC u know what inflation  economic growth means etc,btohqsg
But what does inflation  economic growth mean?,btohqsg
I aint gonna give the textbook definition,btohqsg
Lit is the most fun subject I’ve ever taken other than mathematics,btohqsg
You can run away from reality,btohqsg
When your teacher explains all the symbols and shit,btohqsg
Mm I agree but it can be a bit stupid on the rare occasion,btohqsg
Is it like a Dan Brown class,btohqsg
Nobody else in the cohort has that,btohqsg
Omg I just found another way to stalk John,btohqsg
Time to ask my juniors who took CFMl in ac,btohqsg
Symbolism is an essential literary device for most texts,btohqsg
Maybe they're from the fm class,btohqsg
Yes but DB just anyhowly connects stuff  and it was a j0ke,btohqsg
https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/HybridCan John perform some psychic stuff,btohqsg
But OCS isn't even the most exclusive of NSF placements,btohqsg
Should ask your fellow males where they went for NS,btohqsg
As long as you are not a clerk,btohqsg
High chance you got no 2x shit of a clue what others actually do in NS,btohqsg
FWIW  DB is fking interesting when I asked about it,btohqsg
It's still an interesting split. It's the military after all,btohqsg
Supposedly theres a religion of ppl that go instantly to DB too,btohqsg
I mean we don't have shit like KILLSATS and/or Star Destroyers that pew pew planets go boom boom but SG still has a military,btohqsg
Oh I was trying to make a joke about the LHL sticker,btohqsg
I don't even know if he went for Reservist,btohqsg
Used for DPM Teo I think when he visits military stuff,btohqsg
How's hbl going for all our tutors here? I personally am very drained after every lesson and its so hard to some student's attention,btohqsg
Just gonna forward it here to ask a qn,btohqsg
U teach group or 1 to 1?@xenite,btohqsg
I believe majority of uni students eventually turn to doing it after sometime in uni?,btohqsg
Cos is the fastest way to clear student debt,btohqsg
Actually what’s your policy for students who don’t pay attention,btohqsg
The thing is... they don't... they all pay attention,btohqsg
Like first lesson i will spend extra 30-45mins to talk a bit about my journey as a student,btohqsg
So you give a pep talk before every session,btohqsg
Rather than u just piss off after the end of 1st lesson,btohqsg
TIP training was valuable after all,btohqsg
The student will still see u as a stranger in 2nd lesson,btohqsg
I did it way before TIP,btohqsg
TIP workshop didnt teach much tbh,btohqsg
Cause they’re not interested in the work,btohqsg
sgeducator is a legit tutor grp or they trolling,btohqsg
Well i just told them if u are not keen in doing well in the subject  u shouldnt take tuition,btohqsg
I just tell them straight in the face,btohqsg
They’re trying to be legit but right now half the people there talking are the alts of one guy,btohqsg
Its prob legit  but i aint gonna talk in there,btohqsg
Yes  thats why students are dropped if they really dont give a fkIn my 2 yrs so far that only happened for 1 person,btohqsg
What does 'legit' mean to you,btohqsg
Who isnt interested to do well,btohqsg
Procrastination and interest are the 2 main obstacles tbh,btohqsg
Ya lor thats why need to set goals,btohqsg
Looks like too much effort to be fake,btohqsg
Not rly  but ye i do,btohqsg
Just spend some time to know them moreAnd talk more abt myself,btohqsg
What u thinking of ? 0.0,btohqsg
Most students who go tuition arent rly liddat,btohqsg
So i dont think thats a concern,btohqsg
But cfm will have such students,btohqsg
That’s why tuition is just school on easy mode for the teachers,btohqsg
Theres fine tuning done for work given,btohqsg
But workload ofc sch teachers have it harder cos of admin matters,btohqsg
To me not much diff ngl,btohqsg
Its actually the same  just more eyes staring at you,btohqsg
I mean  you have to handle different profiles of students,btohqsg
Some are easier to teach and some are not,btohqsg
I find that fun at times,btohqsg
Some respond to this some respond to that,btohqsg
It is part of the fun,btohqsg
"Thats why u introduce the ""one for all  all for one"" rule",btohqsg
I nearly made the class do something stupid cos of 1 uncooperative person,btohqsg
Yes  except that compromises are made initially,btohqsg
Until it reaches a point whereby its too much,btohqsg
for olevels organic chem is removed right,btohqsg
is it all 4 topics or js the intro to org chem part,btohqsg
According to the press release yes,btohqsg
The rest is supposedly still inside  but to be confirmed,btohqsg
Press release said ‘organic chem’ didn’t specify,btohqsg
I remember back when we were just JC kids,btohqsg
Its sad u see it that way,btohqsg
I was never a jc kid,btohqsg
If u think about it with reference to the group title  it is true,btohqsg
Would u prefer the above talk or random gibberish on good looking guys/girls and dating tips?,btohqsg
We want this to be a place for all students to have discussions !,btohqsg
Its sad u see it that way,btohqsg
Why are you turning him into a weeb,btohqsg
I’m not a Weeb I hate the Japanese !!,btohqsg
Ur course got how many guys,btohqsg
my brother in law is from psych so a lot,btohqsg
Just because there’s a goalkeep doesn’t mean you can’t score,btohqsg
All’s fair in love and war,btohqsg
Im glad no one can see my dps,btohqsg
Imagine if a class has 3 cute girls,btohqsg
negligible like the number of females in computing?,btohqsg
How many cute girls are there in Maths@junghon3709,btohqsg
Are females even existent in infosec,btohqsg
Every girl is a cute girl,btohqsg
(I have to say this otherwise I’d get punched),btohqsg
Who is looking over your shoulders,btohqsg
Blink twice if you need help,btohqsg
Dimples is a pretty specific preference,btohqsg
Jk no one is looking over my shoulders,btohqsg
It is a non rivalrous and something other good,btohqsg
Literally no one here knows me irl,btohqsg
And I think I have met all those whom I know irl,btohqsg
Saw u in nus the other day,btohqsg
