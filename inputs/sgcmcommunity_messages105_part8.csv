ya but when have people queueing up to pump  whichever empty one you see just go,btohqsg
even the 100 also cheaper than our 95,btohqsg
I prefer the 100 so must look out for pumps that have it,btohqsg
The first one on the corner is 100 only and usually empty,btohqsg
No choice bah  min. grade 98,btohqsg
This season running until where first is the impt qnðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Go back to where it all started,btohqsg
I think high chance unless we take stronger steps,btohqsg
