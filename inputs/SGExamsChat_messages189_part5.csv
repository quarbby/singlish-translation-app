story is a bit different if u do super well in a levels/poly and unis pay u to study at the uni itself,btohqsg
how do i get paid for studying,btohqsg
basically ur future is full of $$$$$,btohqsg
i wont say it is guaranteed for sure for the 'internal scholarship',btohqsg
but only the best end up in true finance,btohqsg
finance can be as wide as ur AIA insurance agent,btohqsg
i will say a considerable amount of ppl end up in the true areas of finance,btohqsg
but not every1 can get in,btohqsg
i mean for me is just study what i like,btohqsg
ya  even finance majors may not necessarily enter finance,btohqsg
It is alot easier for other majors to enter finance then the other way round,btohqsg
You can find engine sci computing majors etc in finance,btohqsg
just need to ace the physics mods more,btohqsg
Those are dominated by math/stats grads,btohqsg
Was todayâ€™s pure bio paper kept confidential or smth,btohqsg
How would anyone have today paper? Bring scanner in?,btohqsg
Some tutors take as priv candidates,btohqsg
They can scan it and send,btohqsg
iirc they only can do it for some papers,btohqsg
as not all papers can be brought out of exam hall,btohqsg
^ as in i believe where the scanned copy comes from is when the exam centre has excess ppr,btohqsg
most of the time just wait till next year TYS come out then see LOL,btohqsg
I think Thats also how schools have a copy,btohqsg
iirc by right all exam papers are classified and confidential,btohqsg
and not to be released to public domain,btohqsg
Thats y u dont see online copies of the tys,btohqsg
any scanned papers are all brought out and scanned later,btohqsg
cuz idt any teacher will risk their job over releasing o level papers,btohqsg
