Hi all  anyone has experience paying AIA insurance with cardup? Is it allowed since cardup does a bank transfer?,btohqsg
It doesn‚Äôt meant if the party who signed is actually UOB. Best to call the UOB and ask them directly. By providing your ID and password and OTP  the other party can go into your bank account.,btohqsg
Hi guys   i recently read up alot on how ILPs are straight trash and alot of negative returns.Im currently 3 years into an ILP with great eastern at 2400/year and im @ positive 1000 return already. Am i just lucky or is ILP just not as bad as people think ?,btohqsg
Can work. But you have to pick the cards that is eligible and net positive cashback or good amount of miles.,btohqsg
You put $7200 for 3 years and you earn $1000? That is almost 14% gain. You sure there is no catch?,btohqsg

You can just invest on your own. With similar holdings using ETFs etc. And cost is a lot lower.ILPs cost is super high.,btohqsg
Saw the applicable part  but not sure if clause applies that have to use lady‚Äôs card to pay for the travel ticket!,btohqsg
yeaa but if i wna stop paying the premium   i was told id lose everything inside...,btohqsg
anybody has experience with city index and knows if its legit ?,btohqsg
Hahaha see the Google reviews tho,btohqsg
https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid/institution?term=city%20indexcant seem to be found in MAS site,btohqsg

Can I draw money in Ho Chi Minh using You Trip?,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a charge in Vietnam ATM,btohqsg
hi to apply giro to pay dbs credit card from hsbc ega account I have downloaded the dbs interbank giro form but... looks funny.1 To: name of bank is hsbc  branch?2 the signature match dbs record isn't? Thanks,btohqsg
Hi all  just a curious question. If I DCA monthly vs DCA weekly will it make a big difference? (Not inclusive of fees),btohqsg
I wrote raffles place for branch. Signature should match both DBS and HSBC records,btohqsg
Oh sad. I don't want to go hsbc to add signature. Thought only dbs can already,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt remember. Just a few dollars I think,btohqsg
Won't able to apply for giro if you  don't have signature records with HSBC,btohqsg
So long as the ATM machine has the Mastercard logo you can draw the money out. Fee wise have to see the bank charges. Different ATM from different bank fees might be different,btohqsg
Guys  check with you  for OCBC infinite CC  if I use it to pay for insurance  it would not have cashback  but will it be considered as spend and clocked the minimum spend? Thank you!,btohqsg
Then you cannot apply GIRO already. That takes away 1/3 of the point of having HSBC EGA account,btohqsg
And still unclear start 1 may if credit card giro still have cashback?,btohqsg
All but 1 CSO say have. And they're not UOB CSO.. so...,btohqsg
Yea I am thinking maybe wait 2 weeks... if hsbc ega no more Cc giro cashback then just only use for interest ok,btohqsg
Legit. Operate for more than 10 yr in sg. I use their cfd during the big run up from2005-2007. Then run down from 2007 to 2009. Give up on leveraging. Lesson learned üòÇ,btohqsg
City index. IG market. Both mostly use for leverage trade on cfd.,btohqsg
hi gurus  any1 know how to use/utilise card up  and how it works?,btohqsg
For uob one spending  which card to use for groceries and transport?,btohqsg
Opened the acct online? If so  branch is Dhoby Ghaut n acct no starts with 142.Signature submission no need to queue for counter. Can just do at the booth where u get the queue num.,btohqsg
Oh. Bring your phy ic for verification. Digital one no count,btohqsg
Now I heard people said may no more cashback on credit card giro on hsbc ega,btohqsg
So what is the best sav plan for small amount  $5k,btohqsg
Login to cardup website n create account and arrange a payment  then you will know.,btohqsg
