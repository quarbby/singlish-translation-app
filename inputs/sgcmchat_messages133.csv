text,group
u used to be salmon now you're tuna and that scares me too,btohqsg
no because people kept finding my telegram and texting me weird shit,btohqsg
That sucks  I can only imagine,btohqsg
Bro woke up n chooses violence,btohqsg
just because you don't like them doesn't mean they're ass lol.,btohqsg
like put them blocks into a better looking car,btohqsg
Them JDM are old as heck  it can fall apart,btohqsg
sometimes  opinions that don't benefit others should be kept unspoken,btohqsg
sure it might be fucking ugly and shit,btohqsg
but it's someone's pride and joy,btohqsg
shitting on them makes you feel better,btohqsg
but there are real fucking owners paying for them  something you aren't doing,btohqsg
why u pressed over someone saying smthg,btohqsg
eh  whatever helps make our community better,btohqsg
no point la help the community,btohqsg
Making the community better by not letting people voice their opinion bro,btohqsg
will always have people that shit on others and so on,btohqsg
no such thing as everyone have same mindset one,btohqsg
if have such thing then thats not this planet la,btohqsg
Anyone wanna help with our next meet pm me,btohqsg
this why people try to sell cp to u 😓,btohqsg
I like SportCars  you like JDM  can’t I voice my opinion out just like how you did for JDM?,btohqsg
when did i voice out abt jdm,btohqsg
just because you like apple doesn't mean samsung is a pile of shit,btohqsg
even if they're shit at least have basic respect lah.,btohqsg
if it's the 991/992 then yes,btohqsg
997? that is *the* perfect one.,btohqsg
What’s the hype on that car?,btohqsg
when you get in one you'll understand,btohqsg
omg im not the only one who seperates the bun and the chicken,btohqsg
Can't be shitting on cars when u don't own one tbh,btohqsg
i hated them  now i wouldn't mind owning one.,btohqsg
thanks for the update m bouta check it ur after sch,btohqsg
"as someone that's had a certain rich kid who claims the hypercars are ""his"" shit on mine before  i agree.",btohqsg
the only sequence i'll eat it 😓,btohqsg
"""auto is faster than manual""wait till he tries the fucking W201 auto lol",btohqsg
with technology advancing like my pubes,btohqsg
that is one sentence i never thought  would read but ok,btohqsg
said this to a few friends  but i tried an A45S back to back with an FD2R,btohqsg
but all the shits and giggles were had in the FD2R,btohqsg
every tunnel you just let the revs creep to the 5k crossover,btohqsg
we went just over the limit with the FD  driver and i fucking smiles everywhere,btohqsg
A45 launched at every other light,btohqsg
ironically A45S has worse comfort than FD2R,btohqsg
Newer merc seats aren't very comfortable,btohqsg
i think the car was decently broken in but errrrr,btohqsg
you can really feel every bump  even on the highway,btohqsg
the FD was on BCBR coils  highway it felt very smooth.,btohqsg
And arguably has the best steering feedback and track suspension from factory out there,btohqsg
tbf they came out with the ST,btohqsg
Like what do you feel is lacking in a 3rs,btohqsg
So if something is good  you would still go out and fk with it because you don't want it to be from factory?,btohqsg
That's not driver connection mate that's personalization,btohqsg
I don't believe it's perfect tbh,btohqsg
Having been in a .2 3rs,btohqsg
Everyone I've spoken to who owns or has extensively driven one,btohqsg
They say it's the best you get at that price point if you want something harsh,btohqsg
Even emotionally  what you're describing is personalisation,btohqsg
the r stands for really good.,btohqsg
Which is why I'd rather a Carrera T over a GTS or turbo/s,btohqsg
Or a GT3 over a 3rs,btohqsg
There's been one around for the 991.2 as well,btohqsg
tbf the modern 991/992s are abit plump but oh well,btohqsg
Not a lot of creature comforts,btohqsg
The 991.2 I feel is a sweet spot,btohqsg
I don't particularly like the .1s front,btohqsg
because i'm still deciding between the c or the p,btohqsg
funnily enough the 991 is already a decade old,btohqsg
yet seeing one is still a treat.,btohqsg
my heart lies with the 997s. would love to own one someday.,btohqsg
It's insane to think of it that way,btohqsg
the overall design still holds up,btohqsg
the 997 is getting slightly dated  but i am biased.,btohqsg
it isn't. it never will be.,btohqsg
Some 996s also not bad  I weirdly like the headlights,btohqsg
Sad that they are already peaking here,btohqsg
i think 964s are quite neat too,btohqsg
would love to see the rubystone carrera rs someday,btohqsg
wonder what the mileage is now,btohqsg
I think there's one around this week,btohqsg
I'm not sure if you know them,btohqsg
But the Lee Collection from Perth is here,btohqsg
And they've brought 2 trailers full of their cars,btohqsg
Mad man in Perth with some insane cars,btohqsg
Almost all the modern hypercars out there,btohqsg
the mad man part not the cars,btohqsg
that's a different level of rich,btohqsg
Yes and he's got chirons on oz plates,btohqsg
we don't talk about rich energy or ftx,btohqsg
But yeah they've got a cars and coffee around,btohqsg
Everything from golf gtis to a purple laf,btohqsg
asking for a friend do they shit on the jdms?,btohqsg
But you see less jdms here,btohqsg
Also people don't know how to drive,btohqsg
"yeah apparently there was a law that prevented overseas manufacturers from importing ""JDMs"" to AU",btohqsg
Barely seen a single person park without kerbing multiple wheels,btohqsg
have been watching aussie dash cam videos for years. they can't drive.,btohqsg
Even after having the hardest license course,btohqsg
true kopi license starts with them.,btohqsg
i can't tell if that's a 50 Jahre M3,btohqsg
but if it is that's neat.,btohqsg
Nope regular comp with 50 jahre badges,btohqsg
Keep ur opinions to your self,btohqsg
Then y do they still work till today,btohqsg
It’s not the they can be sports cars it’s the fact that they can destroy cars like lambos ect. And that JDM cars have sooo much they can be done to them for example you can’t put a 2JZ GTE twin turbo on a Porsche 911 GT3 RSThe thrill of the JDM cars is that you can fuck around and mess with the engines to make it faster or build it to a specific category (drift  drag  street ect) but if you buy a GT3RS the engine is alr built the more you fuck with it it defeats the purpose of the car and the way it’s built ( not saying that GT3RS can’t be built),btohqsg
tell me you're 12 without telling me you're 12,btohqsg
i am a JDM enthusiast as well,btohqsg
but saying that they can beat supercars is a massive stretch.,btohqsg
requires a fuck ton of work,btohqsg
a 3RS is already practically perfected from factory,btohqsg
which country are we in now?,btohqsg
trust me  i have friends who throw a fuck ton of money to make their cars half decent,btohqsg
japanese cars are easy to mod,btohqsg
but throwing a fuck ton of mods together haphazardly doesn't make it fast,btohqsg
just because your GTR has 1000whp doesn't mean it's a go-anywhere  do anything car,btohqsg
people overly worship JDMs. they have their limits.,btohqsg
The toyota wish can fit groceries,btohqsg
as a Probox enthusiast i will vehemently deny,btohqsg
also please fill me in on why the A80 and 2JZ is so adored,btohqsg
they fucking threw out the 2JZ in favour of a 3SGTE for the GT500s,btohqsg
which means the 2J is arse,btohqsg
Laughs at boost leak on a 2jz,btohqsg
had a friend who owned a A80. sold it within a couple of months for a more livable TME Evo,btohqsg
the boost leak was the major issue,btohqsg
"B58s "" am I joke to you ? """,btohqsg

Someday I hope to own a b58 powered car,btohqsg
i've heard alot of good things about B58s. shame those are crazy expensive here.,btohqsg
If I could b58 swap my e93 I would,btohqsg
The problem with the current cars is that there's really no feel,btohqsg
indeed. they're just built to be fast.,btohqsg
So even with such a good engine the drive isn't very engaging,btohqsg
bring back no power steering 😗😗😗,btohqsg
Have parked with it and nearly died,btohqsg
You'll be covered in sweat every time you park 😂,btohqsg
i tried my friend's E30 in thailand  died while parking and creeping out of the lot,btohqsg
normally this is spam but it’s funny so it’s okay,btohqsg
Paul walker aint walking out of this one !!!,btohqsg
wasn't backing out from being a pedo either 🫡🫡🫡🫡,btohqsg
He walked out of this in a few,btohqsg
wasn't walking out of the porsche for sure,btohqsg
just realised that the Ineos Grenadier uses a B58. that would actually be pretty neat to drive.,btohqsg
Although if you really use it off road idk how the zf8 will handle it,btohqsg
doubt they'll ever be *really* sold here but would be neat to own one,btohqsg
i'm sure they tested the Grenadier to the extremes already,btohqsg
maybe more so than the Defender 😬,btohqsg
Looks like an interesting car to own,btohqsg
Although I don't think I could daily a high car,btohqsg
I tried some last week and I couldn't take the body roll,btohqsg
"if i'm not wrong the ""civillian"" variants are quite okay",btohqsg
I'll continue to sit almost to the floor until my back can't handle it anymore,btohqsg
Eps just not it in the city,btohqsg
Heard a lot of mixed reviews,btohqsg
I'd rather an S but fine rn with this,btohqsg
I do prefer N.A.s so miss our previous cayenne a fair bit,btohqsg
Handling + powah + decent practicality,btohqsg
who that time want to see the diorama parking,btohqsg
Anyone considered hosting meet at t4 outside car parking,btohqsg
U know there is a hot zone,btohqsg
All it takes is one bitch to call and the shit hits the fan. Later not only SPF  Aetos  Airport Police all kena activated.,btohqsg
Bro  I wanna ask the diorama parking lot got acrylic front glass right?,btohqsg
i selling with rwb and r34 wagon open hood,btohqsg
there is no other better GT3RS,btohqsg
i would rather see it end with RSR tho,btohqsg
looks + purity it's the 997 RS4.0,btohqsg
can imagine flooring it down ecp,btohqsg
funnily they made a Hybrid RSR or somehing along those lines,btohqsg
i am the wrong target audience,btohqsg
but yes that would be dope.,btohqsg
Isit rlly considered hopping if he always has been liking the 3RS?,btohqsg
So liking a 3rs is trend hopping now,btohqsg
Let the guy enjoy his flame tune cs3 la. Respekt all build mah even tho .... yk...,btohqsg
Issokay bro. All these yp not classy enuff to appreciate Porsches,btohqsg
Years of saving on bike maintenance hence using fixie so can afford the car. Okay la. Let him feel like he is at the top,btohqsg
Maybe one day he can go CNK experience the many purist,btohqsg
No leh  later come pop and bang at Dempsey,btohqsg
