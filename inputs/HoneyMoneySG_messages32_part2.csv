If your are booking airticket or hotel Citi reward don’t reward you also,btohqsg
I thought Citibank rewards card exclude travel related transactions from getting 4mpd? See item 6.(ii)https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/citi-rewards-card/pdf/10x-rewards-promotion-terms-and-conditions-2020.pdf,btohqsg
Nope it listed on Apple Pay websiteBank issued Amex not compatible,btohqsg
But i can use youtrip onbookings.comrite? to prevent the multi currency fee,btohqsg
you can but it wiser to use HSBC Revolution or DBS Altitude to earn some rewards from it,btohqsg
You may want to compare the price between multiple booking websites. I thinkbooking.comis not the cheapest.,btohqsg
ouh because currently idh any of those and my parents dont have it aswell. the citi bank card i was talking about was my dads,btohqsg
ouh ic. I was planning to use my own standsrd charted cashback debit card to topup to youtrip and use youtrip from there,btohqsg
If you want to book airticket  Skyscanner may give you a list of websites to compare.,btohqsg
I think most of the air ticket booking websites allow you to pay using SGD currency.,btohqsg
i am jus looking for hotel rooms. My airplane tickets are already booked,btohqsg
Then You can check the hotel price listed on Agoda too or perhaps compare against the price on hotel website directly.,btohqsg
Delayed by 1 day  i will post tomorrow 8pm,btohqsg
Is it possible to cancel a credit card  transaction made an hour ago?,btohqsg
Did you make the purchase yourself?,btohqsg
You can try calling the CC company tomorrow to see if it's possible.,btohqsg
Oh no... I signed up for the dbs altitude amex last week for the 20k miles thinking that amex have the loungue access.. its only for dbs alt visa... FML,btohqsg
I wonder if it's possible to cancel the application by calling the bank?,btohqsg
Waiting for your take on budget!,btohqsg
Card arrived and activated... I was trying to sign up for the piority pass only to see that only for visa and not amex.  I guess no choice.. get my wife to sign for the alt visa as I have cpm already. Den my alt amex just hit and run on the Miles,btohqsg
I think you can hold both,btohqsg
Any recommendation which brokerage should I go with if I want to start my dividend investing journey? Moomoo ? Syfe?,btohqsg
"Any prev. discussion on the SCB's smart credit card? ""Get S$200 cashback when you activate when you activate your card within 30 days of card approval."" —> Does it only works on those specific spending?",btohqsg
No spend required to get the $200 cashback  just need to activate within the stated period. The $200 you are free to spend on whatever you want.,btohqsg
Reason why i ask is because i accidentally book a non-refundable hotel on a wrong date through expedia. i contact expedia and they say its non reundable and they need to contact hotel and give me the result in 72hrs. i only realised wrong date right after i made the payment so the cancel request was made less than 10mins.,btohqsg
2c worth start with interactive brokers. Fees a bit higher but you save on a lot of junk fees and you have access to way more markets than just SGX and NYSE/Nasdaq,btohqsg
Example: a lot of seasoned investors recommend buying Irish domiciled ETFs listed on LSE because Ireland has a tax treaty with USA. Normally you pay 30% dividend tax to Uncle Sam if you're a foreigner but Irish funds only pay 15% dividend tax. IBKR has access to LSE but tiger  moomoo  webull  syfe etc do not,btohqsg
Webull! Check out the promo but can get moomoo as well since both zero commission brokers,btohqsg
Thank you! Will definitely check that out. Didn’t know about the 30% tax omg!,btohqsg
For sure will join webull for the rewards  just wanted to know if I should also “use” it. Or just get the rewards and run..,btohqsg
I intend to use it just like I used moomoo. But will see about nyse since I don't really fancy high withholding tax....maybe just use sgx,btohqsg
It is tax on dividends not capital appreciation,btohqsg
Booking.comor agoda coupled with Shopback. When shopback has promo and increase the percentage of cashback really not bad..,btohqsg
should contact the shop. If they agree to refund  you can get back your money. If you call cc bank they will ask to contact the shop,btohqsg
The shop has the right to not refund your money  all depend on the t&c,btohqsg
hi guys  was just checking the citi rewards card - am new to credit cards. what does the interest on purchases mean?,btohqsg
any amount u spend on credit card basically,btohqsg
what do u mean? is this a late payment fee or additional payment ontop of the amount i spend?,btohqsg
If you don't repay in full every month  then that's the interest you accrue. Hence  pay in full and on time every month!,btohqsg
Would we receive an email notification after submitting the hsbc Ega application?,btohqsg
Did it through the app previously (not instant approval),btohqsg
I only get the email after the application is successfully open. It took 17 days for them to process my application.,btohqsg
For HSBC revo cc  understand only the 6th transaction will receive cashback. For the first 5 what constitutes qualifying? Must it be in whitelist or anything counts?,btohqsg
That's additional cashback for everyday+ programme. I assume you have EGA account  then just do 5 fast transaction and from the next day onwards all cc transactions will get that additional 1% cashback (usually you'll get sms if you are enrolled to everyday+)As for cc 2.5% cashback  it should include first 5 transactions too  provided they are in mcc whitelist,btohqsg
Hi   1) does citirewards give points for comfort delgro?  2) can i link amaze card into comfortdelgro app? Thanks,btohqsg
No need to use amaze for comfort delgro app. But not for comfort inside the kris+,btohqsg
confirm kris+ pay by citireward card will be no 10x rwd,btohqsg
Any current promo for opening EGA account?,btohqsg
Can someone explain what the CPF ceiling mean?,btohqsg
If I earn $8k and my CPF contribution is $1.6k  meaning I can only do voluntary top-up of another $5.4k as of now?,btohqsg
