I count all the reasons above. Why I quit to become a solopreneur:1) No opportunity to learn or rise up2) No pay increment3) Learnt everything in 1 month  got bored4) I realised I am quitting most jobs during or shortly after probation and it wasn't sustainable (HR also asking too many probing questions),btohqsg
