Ngl the main reason I'm taking chemistry is because of H2 Bio,btohqsg
i cant do long division either,btohqsg
the fuck if i know that,btohqsg
didnt threaten to kill myself when i got burned 1k in 2 days in investments,btohqsg
but did u keep ask how to do,btohqsg
when all u need to do is jus read,btohqsg
she was asking how to do even though there are like 5+ ppl helping her to explain,btohqsg
jus her anxiety take over beacuse her friend say she dumb for not understanding long div,btohqsg
there is a difference if u call urself dumb for fun and actually being dumb,btohqsg
idk to me if u can go jc means u quite smart rdy,btohqsg
I mean ig I was blocked too ngl,btohqsg
"It says ""last seen"" smth smth",btohqsg
That's all there is to it,btohqsg
idt the problem was the asking tbh it was like her keep saying she was stupid even though we alr told her multiple times to stop,btohqsg
is being last seen of a very long time means,btohqsg
I mean idt you were involved in the saga,btohqsg
But damn we were just trying to help her,btohqsg
Haven't exactly seen you ard here here ykwim,btohqsg
Ya cos I couldn’t rly care about teaching math lol,btohqsg
I just mainly told her to have more self confidence,btohqsg
She was asking qns here when there's another chat specifically meant for it,btohqsg
But if there is an underlying mental issue need to seek more professional help,btohqsg
Like sure a few times ok,btohqsg
But she was uk doing it consistently,btohqsg
and on&off here and the other chat but imo mainly here more than the other chat,btohqsg
Meh can’t rly care about this if no one wants to help then they’ll just not reply,btohqsg
This chat is like very random anyway,btohqsg
A lot of my messages get drowned out,btohqsg
I mean I think she briefly mentioned about it,btohqsg
There’s just too many when there’s many chatting at once,btohqsg
And I think someone here that knows her said some stuff about it,btohqsg
Like she got seek help before,btohqsg
Also idk why sometimes in the other chat ppl keep asking very general qns,btohqsg
Like how to study for XXX subject,btohqsg
These sort of things can easily search online and there would be better answers,btohqsg
Lol I mean maybe they wanna hear personal exps,btohqsg
I'd assume boldly that they are already calm enough to be discussing this subject,btohqsg
probably they want personal experiences ba,btohqsg
also just offtopic but have you guys seen the key_battle_5633 guy on reddit,btohqsg
he has like a big inferiority complex,btohqsg
"so like he writes alot of comments about how he didnt do well for psle and o levels so he sees himself as inferior and he also likes to call his own jc a ""low mid tier jc""",btohqsg
wait let me send an exchange i had w him,btohqsg
actually in TM  the H1 chinese is always late in the afternoon and i had 2h gap between my last lesson and H1 chinese,btohqsg
i think he is from TM right iirc,btohqsg
i saw something he wrote on a TM post,btohqsg
the time when bruh i remembered writing the same thing over and over again becoz there were at least 5 posts asking the same thing,btohqsg
then what is with this inferiority,btohqsg
dk what you mean by irl but it’s math that a lot of engineering or science majors would learn in y1  of uni. not all of it bc it depends on the major itself but stuff like linear algebra and multivariable calculus,btohqsg
bro who tf is this key battle,btohqsg
i see him in every comment,btohqsg
