I was behind an ioniq 5 this morning,btohqsg
God it looks like a soulless piece of shit,btohqsg
curious to see what battery technology we will have by then tho,btohqsg
i think it looks nice eh,btohqsg
Teslaâ€™s design was they gave a 3 year old crayon and asked them to outline a car,btohqsg
I drive becoz it is shiok to drive...not becoz it is fast,btohqsg
You know what ev feels like now ?Imagine like got super heros and all. Ev are like the bot controlled ai robots. lol,btohqsg
Its the worldâ€™s most generic design,btohqsg
Singapore roads..how fast wan to beðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Just to confirm  5 is the SUV right,btohqsg
Cos it was an suv i saw,btohqsg
i waiting for kia ev6 to reach sg,btohqsg
the front looks like a mask,btohqsg
It looks like it was designed by a robot,btohqsg
i mean the ev6 looks more like a normal car than the ioniq 5,btohqsg
And why all SUV shapes now for fucks sake,btohqsg
i appreciate all cars  i dont judge,btohqsg
Will it kill them to make an ev that looks like a fd3s,btohqsg
I mean just the shell  and put your cursed ev and battery,btohqsg
i think someone ev swapped an fd3s,btohqsg
The only EV i'll ever consider is honda E,btohqsg
A fit sized car for the price of a quattroporte,btohqsg
The n fusion 74 looks cool tho,btohqsg
I wont want to drive an RC car on the road,btohqsg
i think u just havent reach the old uncle age yet de,btohqsg
Personally wonâ€™t go EV if I have a choice too. Exhaust and engine sounds too impt alr,btohqsg
but later on cfm u will fold,btohqsg
Ev under the hood of an fd2r,btohqsg
"""knn why this car so loud""",btohqsg
Or maybe there just wont be parts to replace anymore,btohqsg
i think i'd be roling in a V8 luxury sedan,btohqsg
I'd rather be seen in this,btohqsg
Tsk so eco unfriendly. Drive a 1.3 L like me,btohqsg
but your 1.3 drinks same amount of fuel as a V8,btohqsg
I dont think lexus burns oil,btohqsg
but yeah  it definitely uses more engine oil cos duhhh bigger engine,btohqsg
We are helping to move the world away from fossil fuels,btohqsg
the faster we can put an end to global warming,btohqsg
Then i can EV swap my rx8 and blast the brap sound from my speakers,btohqsg
Just imagine  all the torque without the wear and tear  all the brap without the engine mount replacements,btohqsg
you sound like you want an EV now,btohqsg
the fun part is not knowing whether the car will survive the next pull or not,btohqsg
Just enjoy the petrol price first,btohqsg
Rotary even piang will still pull,btohqsg
