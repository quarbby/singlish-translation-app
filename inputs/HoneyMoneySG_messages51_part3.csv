How r u told to submit the selfie and photo id?,btohqsg
This was the email message from them,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. It should be most likely legit as you initiate the conversation. My suggestion is to reach out to confirm what photo ID instrarem is expecting to provide as instarem have already authenticate you via our national identity system (Singpass MyInfo) at point of sign up.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm looking for credit card with good hotel and staycation offers,btohqsg
Hi all  I wanna add HSBC revo into Samsung pay. But it says got error  cannot add. Is it true that revo can't be added into Samsung pay?,btohqsg
That's true. You can add to GPay though,btohqsg
You can try submitting your employment contract showing your monthly salary.,btohqsg
Revo only support google pay not Samsung,btohqsg
Thanks@Melvyn2796&@B3DMANfor the reply! Much appreciated! üôè,btohqsg
hows uob one credit card + one account? is the rebate + interest really that good as per uob calculator?,btohqsg
So far it has been good for meAt least it‚Äôs better than Ocbc and HSBC for me,btohqsg
yes if you have exactly 100k you can get 5%,btohqsg
If you haven $100k n can meet the minimum $500 spend + Salary  this is the best now.,btohqsg
If only done the first 2 mission salary and save$500 every month will get how many%?,btohqsg
Which bank product? UOB POSB or ocbc?,btohqsg
Because I never everymonth spend $500üòÇ,btohqsg
Depends on the amount in your account. It goes by tier.You can use the calculator to self calculate.https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.page,btohqsg
It is a mandatory requirement. If you don‚Äôt hit  only get 0.05%You may want to consider ocbc 360 or HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
$500 card spend is a must for any bonus interest on uob one account,btohqsg
Hi‚Ä¶ anyone knows if I linked my Citi rewards to amaze card‚Ä¶ and use it to:- tap for bus and mrt- pay for fitness first membership- pay for Netflix- phone bills- utilitiesDo I get 4MPD?,btohqsg
Hsbc revolution - 1pt /$Sc prudential card - 1pt /$ (need not be prudential policy),btohqsg
* HSBC revo no cashback sir  totally kosongIt‚Äôs not an eligible transaction( 10x points 4MPD or 2.5% cashback) or qualifying transaction in the tnc (0.4MPD),btohqsg
Anyone knows why Hsbc everyday+ say need to make 5 eligible transaction on credit card or debit card(on website)  but in t&c say transfer to non hsbc bank acc also can,btohqsg
It's weird I know but when pay thru axs  apparently there's a point awarded but if u pay insurance company directly  tt one confirm no reward,btohqsg
I think somehow or rather hsbc didn't filter axs insurance payment,btohqsg
Has DP records of this awarded with 1pt/$ In Apr,btohqsg
Anyone experienced same issue? I tried using amaze wallet to pay for grab but then what happened was that my amaze wallet got charged and points got credited the moment I was looking for grab and even after I didn‚Äôt manage to find and didn‚Äôt use grab it didn‚Äôt reverse immediately? Anyone knows how to fix this?,btohqsg
Hi all  thinking of DCAing using cash into endowus for the LT  any recommended funds?Thinking between Lion global infinity and dimensional global core equity,btohqsg
I think Endowus got recurring fees. People use endowus for SRS or CPFOA. Better for you to open interactive broker and buy CSPX,btohqsg
Sorry how come ppl pref use srs or cpf oa instead of cash for endowus? I understand srs 0.05% by default if uninvested,btohqsg
cos they want to use the funds in srs and cpf oa,btohqsg
Hi gurus. Other than Amex TCB and uob absolut  is there any other cards that can earn rewards for utilities  telco bill payment that have no min spend.,btohqsg
is the amaze card useful for people that don't like miles?,btohqsg
Have been seeing amaze being mentioned quite often and wondering did I miss any good deals. have not been reading up about the card even thought I have it.,btohqsg
Advise needed from experts here regarding HSBC EGA. Does the incremental fund that entitles account holder to get the bonus interest need to be incremental every month or can I just increase it one time (eg  after initial deposit or $2k add $10k for the $10k to enjoy bonus interest for next 3 months?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not a miles chaser but I also use the CRMC + Amaze once I hit the cap on my UOB evol card. If if u don‚Äôt like miles  the points earned can also be used for cashback - for CRMC,btohqsg
But one downside to earn points on amaze is for foreign currency only. So if u pay in sgd there‚Äôs no rewards to it,btohqsg
I think most of us only use amaze when we are abroad,btohqsg
one time since compared with reference month. but for the additional 1%  it's compared with previous month.,btohqsg
does anyone know based on past whether hsbc ega will have new promo? current promo ends 30 Jun and i haven‚Äôt sign up üòÖ,btohqsg
They will reverse it couple of days later,btohqsg
I think there's some hacks when you combine it with other cards,btohqsg
Am not a miles person  so I am using it during their current promo period where they are giving out 4% rebate for using its wallet. And I think it‚Äôs not bad as i have redeemed a few $20 cashback (2000 instapoints) already,btohqsg
Yup. Especially common when you‚Äôre using RYDE  which tend to collect / hold more fund in advance,btohqsg
Top up the wallet and use the wallet as a funding source for your payments.,btohqsg
Already ending soon. June 30th end. It is a promo period only,btohqsg
"thanks all for the helpful replies from the community. so much better than replies like ""go search heymax"" or ""go google"".",btohqsg
