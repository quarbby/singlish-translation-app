Moving money for rotation is 100% safe if you don‚Äôt abuse the bank cut off timings. And if u do same name to same name transfers. And not very day do la. Once a month big in/out perfectly fine. If more than $200k sizes over a few days also ok.If bank asks u for info  just provide and tell them the truth u are taking part in bank fresh funds promo. They won‚Äôt care. They just care if your money is clean or not.,btohqsg
