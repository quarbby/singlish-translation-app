The validity of the card is 10 years  so by going back 10 years from the expiry date,btohqsg
You will know  what year is your card,btohqsg
Remember that once you top up money into the card  the validity is 1 year from your last use,btohqsg
So the card is still useless although it have not been expired,btohqsg
When you do not use it for 1 year,btohqsg

people want tesla and not others. why? because it is not just EVs people are seeing but much bigger things than just electric cars. the software system by tesla is better and ha better potential in autonomous driving  where others are lacking.,btohqsg
Yeah its abt their add ons. But if money is not an issue,btohqsg
it is not just that. it has greater potential in capability. and that must go to tesla. anybody can make EVs. but to make a great one with more capabilities is about the software around it. and germans software is terrible,btohqsg

No sane man will buy ugly bmw. The problem is they all look the same. Even bmw salesmen say the say. Can’t tell what is what,btohqsg
If bmw makes this I will cease to be bmw driver.,btohqsg

Is the price for the Qashqai. Really. 170k Really Sick >< And the back seat of the qashqai u sit already at the middle reach custom u need back massage already. Stiff mad,btohqsg
170k tiagong can buy bn golf 1.5,btohqsg
True. Its also a whopping $50k more than the previous 2.0-litre variant😪,btohqsg
Can buy Simple Beats Polo still got change LOL,btohqsg
50k sia can do alot. This car not worth IMO. Like others said 170k get MG ZS sua? Hahahah When its Cat A still got change.,btohqsg
Wonder where they pluck this 170k. 150k can buy civic 1.5t also,btohqsg
coe is dropping ma for cat b,btohqsg
Isn't Skoda Russian brand? Wonder what else. I may be wrong though,btohqsg
The coe is making any car expensive. I've grown to accept  no cars is cheap in Singapore..,btohqsg
honestly  companies that are doing car renting services like get go  tribe car and grab should not be allowed to bid coe with us consumers. for them no matter how high a car price goes  all they have to do is increase the rent amount to ensure they still make a profit in the long run,btohqsg
The government isn’t the one bidding … what do you mean by the statement that the government raise it,btohqsg
😅😅😅 hahaha i think he just misspoke.@ic3l3mont3abro u dont anyhow ah later kana POFMA,btohqsg
Hahah alot of gov people here yah i kinda misphrase nvm lol everyone knows why lah. sure is people bid but tbh u know the numbers? Or they know the numbers? HAHA no transparency de,btohqsg
coe is bidded by dealer  but lta will have enough information  and quota is set by them  in fact they are helping in a way to cushion cat a from next month onwards  as mg ev become cat a  and will see huge demand  currently with 40k arf rebate and cat a coe  mg ev is the best buy car for now on a budget,btohqsg
the other bread and butter ice car  just cant compete at all with higher price  weaker performance  and high petrol tax,btohqsg
So we should see MG ZS alot than Tesla On the road soon? In a way?,btohqsg
currently dealer are seeing around 10% of customer looking at ev  and it will be about time soon we see a major revamp in car industry,btohqsg
I have seen some dealer nearby selling off quite some EVs. Especially Honda E. Looks like demand quite significant. But Chargers wise still slow in installing somehow,btohqsg
actually that isnt good also?? if MG EV is pushed to cat A  wouldnt cat A COE increase alot as well? i really doubt that the cat B COE went so high because of MG though,btohqsg
Singapore is a funny market   tesla like in China is number 1 selling car across all segment and increase price monthly,btohqsg
I see Tesla ma. Got demand Hahaha. Soon Model Y coming in and Kia EV6 see their fight soon. HAHAHA,btohqsg
Yes but other ice model can’t compete due to mg got 40 k rebate,btohqsg
Ev6 no match for model y in Chan and such   maybe in sg yes   as model y omv is at 82 k,btohqsg
must see they set at what price also ba. if they set 135k before COE den it might not be seen as an attractive deal,btohqsg
That is like a 7 series,btohqsg
i think we all go back to i3s liao HAHAHA. hoping they bring in citron ami in!,btohqsg
Tesla sure 130k Before COE. Model Y maybe. But EV6 i dk lea,btohqsg
u can try google model y news  basically is dominance in most part of the world,btohqsg
ev6 and ioniq 5 should be higher ba,btohqsg
Thats why my China friends all driving Model Y sibeh rich HAHAHA,btohqsg
model y   s and x is so top selling that singapore got no stock at all,btohqsg
can anyone here comment on byd interior quality? is it similar to their japs/korean counterpart?,btohqsg
Even model s we need wait for 2 years plus,btohqsg
Currently model 3 is also a 3 month wait,btohqsg
forget it ba  model s the pricing should be quite insane in sg. previously hong seh sold it at 400k++,btohqsg
i think even if tesla sell direct to us  will still be around high 300k due to new tech and coe,btohqsg
Can’t he as omv is 130 k,btohqsg
this is for the base model ba ,btohqsg
Omv is 130 k   arf around 200 plus k after discount then coe 90 k is at least 400 plus k,btohqsg
U can count the basic cost from omv then throw in dealer margin,btohqsg
as in when u say omv is 130k is for the plad version?,btohqsg
My Friend say Model Y selling in China 317800 CNY Equivilent to 68K SGD,btohqsg
Can use it to gauge the omv,btohqsg
Singapore omv for standard range model 3 is at 59 k,btohqsg
yups 140k no opts though. i think by the time add in the options can overshot 150k omv,btohqsg
Tesla will be the new badge brand for modern car buyers .. BMW and Merc too 2000s liao 😂🤣,btohqsg
hahaha surprise not byd. they did try to do well in sg market though,btohqsg
Think for EV we should like omit this ARF thing so when we scrap we get back $0 but that'll also help offset the purchase price,btohqsg
Arf cost more then coe for luxury car   and this is where the main tax is,btohqsg
A lot of ppl just look at coe but not arf   sometime Depent on car model the arf is way more then coe,btohqsg
ARF will determine PARFBuying price minus PARF divided by 10   will give you depri per yearPeople buy car based on depri right?,btohqsg
Ya what I mean is generally ppl complaint above coe make the car so expensive,btohqsg
Can we dun have COE? the car already puapeh expensive HAHA,btohqsg
Cannot dun have COE la hahaha. If dunwan COE our roads really will be like India liao,btohqsg
4 lanes but got 7 cars on the road side by side,btohqsg
COE should Reduce to 5yrs LOL,btohqsg
Now at least 1 lane 1 car. Hahaha,btohqsg

So to reduce that get 4 cyn pls lol just for fuel efficiency u drive semo car also same liao LOL.,btohqsg
today's tech has made 3 cylinder nice to drive. made good by toyota,btohqsg
260 bhp 3 cylinder turbo is powerful,btohqsg
but 3 cylindr bmw 2 series? forget it. they dont put their heart and soul in this. it is trashy,btohqsg
it is positioned just to tell they have a product in this segment,btohqsg
Well…. It sure has its advantages…,btohqsg
OK lah nth is perfect hahahahaha,btohqsg
Yup so depends on if $ is a concern… if not   of course no discussion is necessary:),btohqsg

how isit in terms of performance?,btohqsg
but whichever engine you chose you will not regret. such a job to drive,btohqsg
i blasted the mazda in malaysia to 210,btohqsg
but if you dont drive fast it is real easy. often less than 3000 rpm for most use,btohqsg
was it stable  i drive the 2.0 one @160kphits like floaty,btohqsg
SUVs mazda are all CKD. only 6 and 3 are CBU,btohqsg
hard to sell 3 and 6 in malaysia. malaysians like SUVs. it is like fashion,btohqsg
I think their flood  they drive simi suv also no use,btohqsg
Heh. Must sit higher. So motorbike robber hard to break glass and rob,btohqsg
no. why would it be because of flood. in floods all destroyed,btohqsg
it is just a fashion thing you buy he buys and so i follow kind of buying suvs. females like suvs because they are taller and sit high up,btohqsg
malaysian buyers are followers. they dont have a mind of their own. they are not discerning drivers,btohqsg
it’s a global love for suvs,btohqsg
tat is what i like. press prices lower,btohqsg
Now I also see a lot of suvs in singapore,btohqsg
saloon cars a lot better to drive. mazda 6 is a big car  big boot space.,btohqsg
Saloon car  lower cog  more stable,btohqsg
Suv car  good when u are stuck in jam  can see far… and also want to cut lanes  ppl tends to give way  compared to saloon,btohqsg
dont let females decide what car to buy. they often dont know well,btohqsg
My wife ask me to buy a Serena,btohqsg
I told her I rather don’t change car,btohqsg
hmm prolly gotta check the suspension setup,btohqsg
Personal preference  I prefer either a saloon or suv,btohqsg

Many don’t even know what trans the car has. They have closed minds la.,btohqsg
His decision is based on hearsay. If he had open mind he would have tested Alfa abs many others.,btohqsg
"mazda salesman told me many who tested mazda 6 are happy with the car saying it is good car. but as soon as they go home and friends and wives tell them not to buy mazda but only toyota  their minds are changed. ""aiya why mazda  toyota is the best. best resale value""",btohqsg
Italian not easy to maintain leh...eat pizza and pasta,btohqsg
Japanese cheaper cost also eat rice...,btohqsg
i aint mazda salesman. i changed toyota vios to mazda. because while vios is a good daily car it is boring and goes straight line only. germans call toyotas kitchen appliance cars. they would never buy toyota.,btohqsg
not. not at all. they are very reliable.,btohqsg
i'd say cheaper than bmw to maintain,btohqsg
so between mazda and toyota? both reliable but mazda way more enjoyable and stylish,btohqsg
Then mazda  Toyota and Honda leh,btohqsg
hodna only the type r is good,btohqsg
subaru is good. yes. enjoyable too,btohqsg
Never drive a subaru before  but my colleague bought a subaru instead of mazda  cuz she feels that mazda signal sound like taxi,btohqsg

https://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1090396. 2025 coe down turn will return. 78k for a wrx seem like a good tie over,btohqsg
Just my simple thought . Using a car with high coe really issnt pocket friendly in the long run,btohqsg
sure. but people dont have patience. it is not easy thing,btohqsg
Woww you guys still talking about COE at this time of the night lol 😜 it's like NS for adults! 🆖,btohqsg
Ya. But say in the example of the 78k wrx  just nice scrap in 2025  probably coe come back down. And we can still gun for a new car with better spec compare to Chong into a 100k coe new car. And I think while we dun get the best of tech to offer  we get the best of drive engineering. Of course picking the right car is important too,btohqsg
Lol. Married man only free at wee hours,btohqsg

Someone in sgcm posted the livelink to the opening of the Tesla factory in texas. Tesla showed an updated version of Cybertruck at the Cyber Rodeo event  timed to coincide with the opening of the Tesla factory in Texas.Among the innovations: side mirrors  wiper  shape adjustment of the front and rear headlights. In addition  the handles were removed from the side doors  most likely the pickup will determine the owner itself and open the doors in front of him  well  or by the control key.,btohqsg
that is why it sells. and it is a differentiator. Ford and GM dont get it,btohqsg
i love the futuristic look of cybertruck. makes heads turn. like a mars rover,btohqsg
But dimension is huge.very bad for our country,btohqsg
So we can only watch from far,btohqsg

Even this? Mercedes concept car  Vision EQXX  successfully drove 1000km on a single charge. Moreover  the tests were carried out not in ideal conditions but in normal traffic.,btohqsg
But a big batt also means more time at the charger.  Fast dc also bad for battery longevity.Cost also much higher since the battery is so big. Even a eqs450 now running to an estimate 530k with coe. Stuff like this only for a small market,btohqsg
Gov prefer everyone to drive domestic and economical ev  explains the crazy road tax as the kW goes up. So again the best of tech are pretty much just for masses eyes,btohqsg
1000 km is impressive. what is the weight,btohqsg
Eqxx is sorcery with weight of a typical ice large sedan. That’s probably where the range come from also. Now all the big ev available for purchase all weight over 2 ton,btohqsg

the whole thing - hardware and software FSD is there. it is just to enable it when you say PAY,btohqsg
FSD consists of hardware board and all associated software on it. it is not something new that you download,btohqsg
It just a computer controlling the eletric motor like a giant toy car,btohqsg
many things. complex not so simple. steering  wheels motors  brakes etc,btohqsg

So if the claim is $3000… u pay $2500  insurance pay $500.If claim is $10k  u pay $2500  insurance pay 7500,btohqsg
How come ur Excess is 2 500?,btohqsg
Liberty is good in a way if u get comprehensive. Usually they will waive ur excess if deem not ur fault.,btohqsg
yup im looking at comprehensive. but i saw excess column stated OD $2 500 (within Singapore) .,btohqsg
How come eh mine is only $500/= Excess,btohqsg
U can try whether u can adj ur excess,btohqsg
Usually ppl put higher excess to reduce the premium paid upfront,btohqsg
thx u bros. ya for new driver aka my wife 😪,btohqsg

Manual take over loo 😂 coz sometime small lot then inside Liao got some beam and pillow,btohqsg
Confirm faster for reverse. But for parallel. Got fight.,btohqsg
Heh. But I only use mainly for parallel. Super accurate and so far never hang before. But camera view can be quite scary as it goes pretty near  must trust the system 🤭,btohqsg
So far hang 2x all reverse,btohqsg
Anyway if anything happen can find the Agent? Say the car shitty lo. LOL,btohqsg
Heh it hang but also never hit anything  just that it need some help. They will praise the system,btohqsg
One time reverse because there is some metal bar behind the pillar  so the car in a slant position. So it just brake and require take over. The other one is go in then it go into a position behind the pillar and the front I think near the car on the left and maybe it doesn’t want to take responsibility for the angle and just say take over. But my previous 6gt is a long car  so some places lots can be a bit challenging for the sensors,btohqsg

Am i at the right group?,btohqsg
Wanna ask like which car dealership is trusted in sg,btohqsg
Planning to purchase my first car. Definitely second hand cause looking at the current coe cannot make it. I use motorbike now so the price gap is huge. Need find trusted shop to buy from,btohqsg
You're at the right group but I'll leave the others to suggest but I've always bought second hand unlike my sister and nary a lemon in them whereas the new stuff for whatever reasons have odd lights from the dashboard coming on and going off.,btohqsg
Hard..very few. Even big names have black sheep. But can get tips on how not to get fleeced though,btohqsg
Agreed. My previous 2 rides bought second hand also. Both dealer cmi  2nd 1 also big names also. Pretty hard to get a problem free car. Surely got some issue here and there.,btohqsg
Buy from owner straight may solve this issue though got possibility got issue but usually buy from dealer de got issue de lah if not why sell in a way HAHA,btohqsg
When I trade in my car  my car was problem free,btohqsg
5 years old and not giving me any problems,btohqsg
good lah but u wont know until the other owner bought it haha,btohqsg
Since the rest aren't giving much of of an encouragement  the first car I bought was a Renault. Lasted me through 10 years. Then I bought a Toyota Camry from a private owner  and I did consider extending after 10 years because it ran perfectly. Then a Honda jazz also from an owner then a Mazda 3 (my least fav) But get modifications in contract written in and initialed. Maybe get a mechanic to take a look at it before you buy. If you want  I can ask a mechanic friend to come with you for a fee. Hope you know how to speak mandarin!,btohqsg
Even if you get recommendations here  you can't be sure that the recommender is not the agent or affiliated,btohqsg
And the agent you eventually approach  you can't be sure the model you're interested in  happens to be a problematic one that they are trying to get rid of.,btohqsg
But you test drive the ones you want only when you've settled on final 2 then you bring in mechanic.,btohqsg
Yah...any agent that disagrees or grumbles  walk away even if you really want it. Unless you dun mind paying another few k like the merc buyer in news recently,btohqsg
Used car is like a box of chocolate,btohqsg
LoL and you're gonna get worms in most of them 😂,btohqsg
Car times taught me that real well lol,btohqsg
I kinda disagree. There are second hand agencies with discernment and passion that what they are doing is a service.,btohqsg
Dun count of the 6 month lemon thing. Buy a car with a small over head budget like 3 to 5 k to shake down the car. It goes a long way.  It’s harder then it seem. But you don’t know how the previous owner take care of their car and that has little to do with the dealer.,btohqsg
I think for a start  look for 1st owner type  mileage below 16k per year (just a guide  cos those below 10k a year are likely tampered)  got rare gems are really below 10k cos work home drive only,btohqsg
That’s why people usually will go for single owner  Low mileage and preferable with agent warranty left plus agent service record,btohqsg
Dun get their package i.e. sound system etc  get it done outside. Join that model's chat group and understand more and research more so you can expect what issues to face,btohqsg
If dun mind spend a bit can send for sta evaluation. That u will know if the car has some accidents. The paint work dun lie,btohqsg
Lol agent warranty usually cover engine  gear and another  but wear and tear is you cover ownself  so it's better to get to know the ws your chat group frequents. The agent's workshop usually can't solve most problems or recommend expensive fixes,btohqsg
But small accident can’t be help Over the life span of a car usage. Just hope not the overly big ones,btohqsg
If you have budget constraint  the most you allow is 2 owner.,btohqsg
Ya. Part of buying used cars,btohqsg
But we all agree when we sell car. Other than wanting a better one. Usually there are signs that motivate you to change also 🤭,btohqsg
Most important is dun rush lol take your time,btohqsg
"@sgcarmartpardon me saying here  the cars marked sold  are not necessarily ""sold""  if you know what I mean. So some figures I suspect is marked up through churning.",btohqsg
I suggest whichever merchant that mark sold  ask them for lta papers to prove.,btohqsg
"I.e. customer dun wan to sell anymore  next day listing shows ""sold""",btohqsg
Even sgcarmart's star merchant award I treat it with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
Telegram has this timer thing these days,btohqsg
LoL prevent spamming like I did 😂,btohqsg
Ya. And it dun allow me to send paste message,btohqsg
Is it a iPhone thing or telegram as a whole,btohqsg
Heh. Last type my good advise lol,btohqsg
Buy used car is not a bad thing. Dealer also just a middle man. Expectation must be right. See car that time make sure can bring it out for a short spin. Especially for dual cluth vehicle,btohqsg
Problems can tell in either Low speed or hi revs. shifting gear out of park  reverse drive and the other way round. Make sure no sound and vibration,btohqsg
Hi Rev maybe harder to test without open road. But flood cars usually will have problems in that region when u will get ecu error and power is lost. These are hidden problems that will come down to affect normal driving,btohqsg
"I bought a 12 year car. Spent abt $4K+ on wear & tear stuff. I prefer preventive maintenance rather than workshop's recommendation of ""no need to replace now  save $$  can use until it breaks down""....",btohqsg
I also look for smell in the car. Overly cover with scented stuff i tend to think trying to cover up something. Smoker car usually still ok if you also smoker. But previous owner does his smoking is in the car. Those tend to stay in there for a long time as it’s all into the roof lining and circulation system. Also u can’t smell the moudy smell signs of water leakage or flood car if it’s cover by aroma,btohqsg
Make sure no low fuel nonsense that cannot go too far. Make the agent top up. And take note of the chassis number that you are satisfied with after the spin.,btohqsg
Leather condition also. Not to hiam the leather old or crack. Can always rewrap it. But it’s about how the owner maintain the vehicle.,btohqsg
"True. I will not buy one if the car is ""trying to smell good with artificial aroma"". I dislike car perfumes personally.",btohqsg
But better to get your own outside  cos whatever price you reduce after bargaining with agent  they'll cover back from the so called packages,btohqsg
I prefer the natural smell of old leather seats. 😁😁😁😁😁😁,btohqsg
Ya. Buy old car   budgeting better have a bit left over to zhng or shake down. Depend on model and individual need,btohqsg
Ah ya  I remembered  dun change anything. That's the key. Wanna change  do it outside with your own preferred vendor.,btohqsg
But it’s normal for used car to have perfume . Previous owner preference mah. But those heavily scented to me is a red flag,btohqsg
@danquroslike I mentioned earlier  join that car model's chat group and do research to understand more.,btohqsg
My priorities  get the car's 'health' in order before zng. 😁😁,btohqsg
Hope@danquros's excitement is not dampered by us 😂😂,btohqsg
Heh. Zhng usually is body paint or wrap. Leather change.,btohqsg
This two will make the car new again,btohqsg
It’s like buy new house. U will change the toilet bowl 😂,btohqsg
Heh. So many things to do,btohqsg
First time car buyer or new drivers  personal feel is buy used and not over exoctic or powerful. Move up from there after gain driving and ownership experience,btohqsg
Friends asked me  why buy a 12 year old car and spend $$$$ by adding soundproofing  braces and replacing wear & tear stuff...etc? Why not just buy a new car?My answer to them  it's called love n passion. 😁😁😁😁,btohqsg
Suddenly i thinking how come buy new hse need change toilet bowl LOL,btohqsg
Ya Man. It’s a clean and healthy hobby. Though it does take use some dollars,btohqsg
"Then my question to my friends  ""Do you grow old with your wives (spend $$$ on skin care) or change a younger one?""",btohqsg
HAHAHAH! Eh have people change to younger ones lea,btohqsg
Camry still good to used even more than 10yrs. Less problem,btohqsg
Ya. For those without a right frame of mind. My point of view. 😅😅😅😅,btohqsg
OK lah sometimes things happens for a reason same as car. HAHAHA,btohqsg

Wa. Your car? I got a friend who sold this.  Reason is too fast 😝,btohqsg
Haha. No. Not my car. I wish,btohqsg
447k? More exp then a BMW Ix,btohqsg
Singapore it’s the other way round,btohqsg
Malaysia Ix I think 360 or 370k rm,btohqsg
Malaysian ringgit. Now ringgit is down big. Nearly 320 now,btohqsg
That’s not good car. Just the brand. You want high tech it’s Tesla.,btohqsg
Lol. Too late. My car is ix,btohqsg
447 is top of the line Tesla 3 performance,btohqsg
Model 3 top of the line SG still under 300k I think,btohqsg
if only malaaysia can import from macao. i means signiuficantly low price,btohqsg
Ya it's a matter of hours anyway.,btohqsg
Can use chill mode reduce horse power and torque by 60%,btohqsg

But selling tesla earn money anyway,btohqsg
As price keep increase due to over demand,btohqsg
bad idea unless you want a boring machine. why not look at used mazda 6? cheaper and more fun,btohqsg
But to me fast is good overtaking car and change lane to easy,btohqsg
Different car fits different need 🤭 no fix formula,btohqsg
can sgcarmart improve the search engine? it is quite frustrating when a simple search like this yields no results,btohqsg
Especially against road hogger over taking them is with ease,btohqsg

If u put Camry 2016…. Maybe there might be results given it’s 丰田,btohqsg
sorry t say sgcarmart search is lousy,btohqsg
shoud allow powerful flexible searches. even the malaysian mudah lets you do that,btohqsg
choose mazda over toyota anytime. no regrets,btohqsg

I thought it is from next Monday…,btohqsg
Should have search function that allow us to look for cars with certain features like ACC with Ventilated Seats,btohqsg
Lol. Overly complex advance filter  old people dun know how to use. Seller also need to key in more things,btohqsg
Speed is actually I agree haha before Mazda I choose Honda anytime over Toyota,btohqsg
yes correct. honda is also better than toyota. subaru is also better than toyota,btohqsg
toyota is too old fashioned made by old people who dont want to change,btohqsg
Just a yes/no filter under the features,btohqsg
Trim and features very hard to manage. While it is consistent for brand like Hyundai and Kia over a certain period  pi cars and the Contis varies quite a bit,btohqsg
subaru mazda are aligned or skwed toward european engineeering,btohqsg
I am sure our good people are listening. Need to pay developer to add 🤭,btohqsg
Spammers and scammers must ban 😂,btohqsg
And get money from? Maybe we have to pay more selling fees?,btohqsg
I thought Subaru and Toyota are partner in engineering,btohqsg
Probably subscription to dealer have to go up,btohqsg

you mean toyota bought over sgcarmart?,btohqsg

Anyway if it’s real it must be his foot is light and it’s always expressway,btohqsg
Yes.. only if it’s mostly expressway then can hit good fc,btohqsg
Means can even hit 12km/l once run in.,btohqsg
On the expressway  can average sub 6 litre per 100km. In city cmi.,btohqsg

If I want to forge spirit manner,btohqsg
With the 5w30 syntium it’s incredibly smooth.,btohqsg
My e30 can do 10.5 km a liter for a 20 year old engine,btohqsg
A lot will be gone soon,btohqsg
Volkswagen is the winner… lambo  Bentley  bugatti and Porsche under Volkswagen,btohqsg
And mazda has the best design? Hahahaa,btohqsg
You be surprise vw soon caught up by byd,btohqsg
Byd is rising star already over take bmw and Mercedes,btohqsg
Tesla soon overtakes bmw mercedesnin china sales.,btohqsg
And has the best margins since it sells direct. Zero ads,btohqsg
Yeah lately. Bmw will go down. They don’t know what’s coming. And they don’t want to put full speed on ev.,btohqsg
China sales for 2022 is like dominated by tesla   byd,btohqsg
Europe completely dominated by Tesla. In England hard to buy Tesla. Second hand ones selling at inflated prices. In Germany my friend told me Tesla is way way ahead,btohqsg
why did you put the 2.5 sticker thr haha?,btohqsg
All these legacy big names like b Porsche Mercedes’ VW Audis are behind. Closest one is VW,btohqsg
And Porsche Taycan is a joke. Make the car super heavy. Put more batteries. That’s Nein.,btohqsg
Ev is battery and  software engineering. And Germans are caught and stuck. Suddenly their mechanical engineering prowess got eclipsed,btohqsg
It a brand new game   will see who is the next Nokia,btohqsg
VW has a good chance to succeed. They recognized this earlier and changed,btohqsg
I think many Chinese males like Xpeng and NIO and byd will unseat many Europeans. Since they’re also ahead.,btohqsg
i hear arguments from so many skeptics about quality of tesla not as good as the germans... etc,btohqsg
i think they missed the BIG picture,btohqsg
I am wondering  with EVs  can they just do one platform and keep selling them for decades like the old days of VW beetle.haha,btohqsg
what i really wanted to know is how fast will dealership model goes away under margin p[ressure. Ford and GM would use this perfect reason to close them.,btohqsg
how can these makers compete with their ever large advertisements spend too,btohqsg
so so actually because it is a small engine 1.6/ but because it is motronic and old tech  it WAS considered good then. engine of this capacity should do 13 or more km a liter fuel economy,btohqsg
but it is easy engine to fix repair with no more high techs than just 1 computer. but at that time BMW already has econometer. quite cool. and has service reset interval reminders when others have not thought of this.,btohqsg
is the 3  X and Y based on same platform?,btohqsg
Like far east organisation lor... Yet they came up ahead of the balance.,btohqsg
I think all manufacturer are doing what they can to stay in the business.,btohqsg
It come down to target market and audience. Tesla is in the mass market  wanting to compete with them is an uphill battle as more people start to accept tablet style controls and willing to let go of buttons.,btohqsg
But I think the traditional car maker still have a strong ground as their electric offering has strong case and it nots irrelevant at all.,btohqsg
Actually telsa is not in the mass market as it is no where cheap,btohqsg
A c300 premium is even cheaper then a model3 standard,btohqsg
And model 3 is Thier cheapest model,btohqsg
VW golf mk7 1.4About 13-14 km/litre,btohqsg
It is if u solely look at ev space. Or at least model 3 which is the only official one we are getting. Even a polestar 2 cost more,btohqsg
Musk has his models for the premium market. When that comes along then we can’t call Tesla fully mass market 🤭,btohqsg
Must consider the entry model 3. 80k before coe. It’s really attractive,btohqsg
Dual motor jack up the road tax. On sg road. I think rear wheel work nicely. But either way. I still didn’t choose a Tesla. Maybe if model x is here  things might turn out differently. I am not that advance.,btohqsg
How can a pole star 2 cost more did u even compare the omv it is a big gap that telsa is higher,btohqsg
Model s is in the premium market for sure,btohqsg
if only coe is at 30k,btohqsg
They only lack to launch roadster for hyper car market,btohqsg
tesla is distupting dealership. i am lovin' this,btohqsg
i hope one day we dont have to use dealers. direct purchase,btohqsg
Polestar  about 200k plus with coe. Model 3 dual motor also around 200k for entry. That put them pretty must same right. Polestar 2 is targeted at mass market,btohqsg
elon is intelligent guy. he forsees many things before many. and he planned well ahead.,btohqsg
Our road tax system just not friendly for that kind of power,btohqsg
look at the scale of factories he planned. shanghai not long ago  and now austin and germany in 2022,btohqsg
Polestar 2 selling price is nearly the same is due to dealer margin,btohqsg
Pole star 2 omv is only at 45 k,btohqsg
Model 3 basic is 59 k,btohqsg
Bring me around to the ones you consider 'best'!,btohqsg
But it’s what we pay that counts Ma. That’s why model 3 is the better buy when compare,btohqsg
Or no need to bring me around  just list lol,btohqsg
are you sure? i think it is 110K,btohqsg
Compare yourself  itself when u think is near,btohqsg
in autonomous drivign tech  nobody is near tesla.  they have a headstart and lots of data,btohqsg
Paying middle more money does not mean is a better car,btohqsg
Ya. That’s why model 3 is the better buy,btohqsg
Model 3 competition is like i4,btohqsg
But it is mass market car. It’s the easiest car to own in the entire Tesla line up,btohqsg
Yes when u compare to a class or 1 series,btohqsg
Model 3 is very profitable for Tesla. Like x say  Elon had a bit headstart,btohqsg
Isn’t tesla much more premium hehe,btohqsg
In my shopping days  Build wise I dun feel it’s too bad. But premium and quality I won’t put it in that category. But a good drive and feature pack. It’s very good. I will even call it value for money,btohqsg
I means it not too bad,btohqsg
Other car maker do have advantage   also like example I got a friend looking at model s but can’t get it   so go and get eqs instead,btohqsg
Other carmaker can make use of tesla over demand weakness to gain market share,btohqsg
Like u see polestar and such making use of model y absence,btohqsg
Ya but ppl like us prefer model s,btohqsg
But have to wait like 2 years plus,btohqsg
Heh. I am more of a fat car person. So sedan wasn’t my thing,btohqsg
But I can see most of the active chat here loves a good fast sporty car,btohqsg
Model S will cost quite a bit more. The cabling inside almost double that of model 3. Took that a lot while in Hong Kong pre covid. Not a big fan of sedan.,btohqsg
Ya should at least 130k omv with the increase omv of 220% after 80K,btohqsg
Old and fat Liao. Must take care of the knee and back 🥸,btohqsg
Haha ya I got friend soldHis 911 because of this also,btohqsg
911 is stil ok for the back. It’s getting in and out. Especially if u are quite tall,btohqsg
That why ppl said health is wealth,btohqsg
Saw on MSN about recent incident with SG auto pte ltd. They wanted to scam some guy of his fully paid car for 1.5k+ 300 in repairs. They (the victim) wanted their car back but dealer wanted him to sign contract to  i guess  back off from 1 year warranty agreement.This is what im scared off. Even among the bike shops  they say got warrant but charge a friend of mine $1k for overhaul. Not even 2 weeks need to overhaul. I dont want to experience similar situations again.,btohqsg
🤣🤣 not excited at all i expected this much. Both bike and car seems to have same bs issues with dealerships,btohqsg
I think you’ve not seen. They do not have condos that have useless bay windows. Or planter boxes. Check out their downtown ones like icon altez etc. good quality and layouts.,btohqsg
i bought a 14-year old bmw with 152000km. i become the 6th owner. and i am still using it!,btohqsg
this is a wise thing to do. always buy  a USED car. you can get a good used one. and then you never look back and laugh at the suckers who lose money buying new... hahaha,btohqsg
Hahah so coincidence ah  they saying it’s not good and u got a good deal:),btohqsg
Actually I think the only bad thing about used car dealers are mainly a lot of hidden cost that they try to push to u…. Otherwise I dun think they purposely “damage “ the car to sell to u,btohqsg
And of course they dun tell u something is spoilt if not obvious,btohqsg
actually that was my first used car purchase. and Cartimes cant sell that bmw and so i bought it at sort of scrap + 500. that purchase turned out to be an incredible one that i still keep the car today. a ultimate driving machine that is.,btohqsg
the first salesman - original one - didnt want to help me much when i asked questions. then another salesman from another branch helped me and i bought it.,btohqsg
I usually put car under my wife name and she go and sell car,btohqsg
So poor thing ah   must sell to u for 500 ah when it’s already renewed COE ah,btohqsg
But I floor my car daily,btohqsg
when buying a used car like a coed car. mileage is less of consideration. i usually would find out where the car is used. if it is used mainly on highways for long time then that is a good car,btohqsg
mileage is nothign to do on how good the condition is. if a car spends time doing highway fast driving it means it spends a lot of time HOT. then that is a good car,btohqsg
today my bmw has 600000 km,btohqsg
They don’t know   they only see my wife   so will said own by 1 lady owner,btohqsg
I mean how would they know how the car clocked the mileage  asking X…,btohqsg
U subject your wife to bad karma….,btohqsg
ask. who the driver is. in my case  kinda hard. because it is owened by 5 previous owners. to asses drive the car. be sure it is accident free. body is MOST important. the rests can be replaced.,btohqsg
the mileage displaed in the odometer ma,btohqsg
U said to find out how the mileage was accumulated… so can’t tell right? But actually now maybe can  if they extract the data… and say what is the % of trips made are more than 30km  or xxx km etc,btohqsg
i dont mind the car driven hard as long as engine is hot and ready. because i do that too. in my case i found out later i obtained contact # of previous owner. he drives mostly to JB and been having for 4 years himself and claimed it is a great car.,btohqsg
now for newer car can find out data?,btohqsg
Tesla does not advertise or pay for endorsements. Instead  we use that money to make the product great.” – Elon Musk)  they saw a sharp increase in orders the day after the Super Bowl  apparently benefitting from viewers seeing competitor EV ads.,btohqsg
Wa. Must be a classic. The above pic one ah,btohqsg
i showed already weeks ago. you can find it,btohqsg
Lol. I join recently. Too many message,btohqsg
I got 1 @ 8.7k/year before circuit breaker lol,btohqsg
I maintain my car really well   2 year plus I every 5 k mileage change oil   and pump 98 only,btohqsg
what is the meaning at 8.7/year? did you rent it?,btohqsg
ron98 is a waste of money. doing this wont make engine better,btohqsg
i use ron95 whenever possible. i dont like spending more unnecessarily on fuel,btohqsg
8700 depreciation / year .Now the cheapest selling around 17k / year,btohqsg
