So whats the cheapest car in Singapore now?,btohqsg
New? I believe is Attrage. Now with (fake) ralliart package,btohqsg
All along its been the cheapest? Now hitting 100k an attrage/Spacestar,btohqsg
Perodua Bezza at 100 999?Malaysians will be laughing so hard for Singaporeans to buy RM300 000 Perodua Bezza in SG when they can buy a Mercedes Benz GLC base model in their homeland. lol,btohqsg
LTA will be super happy with so many sugar daddies and mommies shooting up COE!,btohqsg
Puapeh lol 101k For a Bezza?,btohqsg
Having a Cabrio/Convertible is definitely fun for sure.I never thought I would said that until I got one.(and also spend more time vaccuming the insides LOL),btohqsg
With high CEO  will we be seeing expensive cars and less of middle car commute vehicles type? Thus  middle Singaporean Can no longer afford to own cars while the wealthy and super wealthy can flex their wealth on the Singapore roads. Taxis and PHVs excluded.,btohqsg
Possible. The CS lancers are going to be a thing in the past as more and more are deregistrered away. Perhaps more BMWs and Mercedes Benz on the roads,btohqsg
Rolls Royce  Bentley  Aston  Lambo  Ferrari and McLaren,btohqsg
That too far fecth la   Median household income is at 9 k plus,btohqsg
Thats why alot PHV cause wanna drive HAHA,btohqsg
Likely he is using an apple lol,btohqsg
So median household can afford a 2nd hand car what,btohqsg
Everyday i walk pass showrooms i see alot of Cars ready to be delivered LOL including Porche,btohqsg
Yes it means it is still generally affordable,btohqsg
Affordable to higher wealth people maybe ><,btohqsg
COE only 10 years. Depreciation already 10K per year  if it’s 100k,btohqsg
Add body value loss of 2K a year  that is 1K expenses per month just to let a car sitting in the parking lot.Just make no sense unless you are printing money,btohqsg
Thts Why perodua sales very Low lor,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone wanna sell your fit/ jazz left 3-5years parf can PM ya. I got ready buyers. Thank you in advance! 🙏🏻☺️,btohqsg
Honda jazz left 3 years at 60k km,btohqsg
Full throttle beside police car also won't cause any alarm.0 to 100kph: YES,btohqsg
Only the mighty Singaporeans can afford it,btohqsg
this is like 1996. where proton wira sells at 90k. highest coe,btohqsg
In 1996  Sporeans could afford it surely now can pay even more,btohqsg
No wonder EK4 are so expensive now.,btohqsg
Your wife drives a 506 Hp is it??,btohqsg
fk8r worth buying? is it also rising,btohqsg
If I have the money to splurge  I will get a FD2R,btohqsg
In Singapore 🇸🇬  it’s much easier to find the Deutsche trinity than a small car brand,btohqsg
The Govt spent so much money this 2 years…. Which other cash generator is faster than this 2 weekPress once machine,btohqsg
fk8r is much better for all round use,btohqsg
Nothing beats 8K RPM. Plus  FD2R it is still way practical than most sports car.,btohqsg
only issue is that you have to find an unmolested one,btohqsg
then my m3 is way better. 8400 rpm,btohqsg
if you buy this shit   they will laugh at you. it means you wanted a car so badly cant afford a decent one but must buy nevertheless.,btohqsg
But really got people buy bezza in sg,btohqsg
Have  my carpark here got 3 bezza,btohqsg
Should be bought back then when its cheaper,btohqsg
Not todays coe bah? Lol 100k sia,btohqsg
But thats really the cheapest lo,btohqsg
i'd rather buy a used mazda 6 at 50k,btohqsg
When my aussie friend ask me how much is the cheapest car i say $100k they laugh lol they can get benz liao lol,btohqsg
Mazda 6 too huge for me,btohqsg
If mazda i will consider cx3 hahaha,btohqsg
Just a matter of getting used to,btohqsg
After some time  u will go vroomVroom vroom on the roads,btohqsg

After two years sinkies can claim innocence,btohqsg
