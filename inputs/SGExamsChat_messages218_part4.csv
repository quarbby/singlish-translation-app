could very well be someinterdisciplinarycombination of all the regions put together and just know a bit of everything,btohqsg
Clearly states interdisciplinary  so highly likely they're crafting a single general mod,btohqsg
Though...... it would be very ironic if they actually create a general Asian studies mod  because Asia as we know it is an Eurocentric invention. Haha the mods generally in FASS  when they talk about the concept of Asia there will always be a “don’t be fooled by the name” essence  “Asia is a diverse region” heck SEA itself is diverse enough. I wonder how a general Asian mod would do justice lol,btohqsg
yeah  I mean I admit I'm not an expert but even H2 SEA History that's what they say all the time,btohqsg
Just imagine CHS curriculum as an enlarged version of GEMs,btohqsg
They're turning NUS into Yale-NUS gdi,btohqsg
By creating such a large common curriculum,btohqsg
Maybe Yale-NUS was just the beta test,btohqsg

Does anyone has links to exam paper? I remember there used to be a link to a resource database,btohqsg
ya sure want me to pm,btohqsg
its like kinda informal though LMAO for ss^,btohqsg
not formula sheet but like format,btohqsg
some people also scared to ask / sometimes teachers are busy or slow,btohqsg
anyway its fine to ask for help from other methods also thats what this group is for:-),btohqsg
we shouldn't shame people for asking for help :-),btohqsg
Is there holy grail for sec 1-4 exam papers?,btohqsg
Para 1: Why part of it is usefulPara 2: Why part of it is not usefulPara 3: Overall  useful or not useful,btohqsg
cross refer for reliability is what they mean probably,btohqsg
useful depends on qn  eg how is source a useful as evidence that....(eg source b's content) is true?so source a has to be similar to source b for it to be useful but if source a&b different also can be useful (propaganda? for history)so how u ans got different points awarded also,btohqsg
lmao i forgot all my ss formats so cant help much,btohqsg
if wna use bgi must rephrase  textbook stuff for srq,btohqsg
most likely bgi u use for like your first statement? like similar based on what different based on what,btohqsg
A level no have usefulness anymore le hahaI’m saying what I know from Os lol,btohqsg
Formats are devised tactics by students and Teachers  not decreed by Cambridge,btohqsg
Don’t concern yourself too much about formats  downside of knowing formats too well is you don’t know how to be flexible for curveballs,btohqsg
dont worry u just need to knw the format which is the most important n pls re-read the sources well n annotate the similarities btwn sources so its easier to do ur SBQ also when u look at the qns pls indicate what kind of format they are asking for.....most importantly pls read the sources well n understand it if not then bye bye to ur marks-advised,btohqsg
yep correct interpretation of the sources vv impt,btohqsg
yuppp be careful when they ask abt hybrid too cos sometimes ppl are confused with other format....,btohqsg
normally for usefulness just make sure to say that source somthing is useful in saying that..... always say useful cos u will get marks when u ATQ,btohqsg
yup thats the most important thing n pls dont overthink abt the sources cos SS paper can be written in simple sentences,btohqsg
maybe can try label the hybrid qns w which skills needed first,btohqsg
tbh u hv to be v clear with ur intepretations and make sure when u cr to provenance u need to try to write as detailed as possible to get the mark,btohqsg
yup can make sure to look at assertion qn too n annotate the sources whether it supports or not,btohqsg
but make sure to read the background info first**** very impt to knw the sources well like what they will be talking abt,btohqsg
bgi must rephrase! if not they know u copy oni,btohqsg
also srq pls dont use the info given at the start,btohqsg
background info cnnt be used for assertion but it can be used for cross reference,btohqsg
srq just make sure u read ur txtbk n understand content,btohqsg
well we arent sure so i jst say oni? haha doesn't matter right  can jst be a reminder.,btohqsg
sure will do dont be afraid to ask if u wan to be successful,btohqsg
ive got friends who shared their experience with me before,btohqsg
You got to do like inference for the first source you get in the question,btohqsg
"But don't write like ""i can infer from source X that...""",btohqsg
I = inference statementE = evidenceE= explanation,btohqsg
Then for your second para do another IEE for the other souce that was stated in the question,btohqsg
Last para you just evaluate of the source is useful or not base on tone/message/purpose/harsh words...,btohqsg
See if there is any biasness,btohqsg
My pure history sbq always 13 to 16,btohqsg
