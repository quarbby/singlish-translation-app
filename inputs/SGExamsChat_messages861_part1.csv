ü§£don't ask me engineering qns..I'm not a engineer to begin with,btohqsg
no theme - waste time and energy ü•¥,btohqsg
Well project no theme you may want to do a survey of sort,btohqsg
Like you must find a problem to solve right ?,btohqsg
Like eg. Why ppl prefer grab compared to ntuc cab?,btohqsg
Which is disconnected from culture thing,btohqsg
Actually this is a concern for many academic people,btohqsg
Language are loosing native speakers and some are reaching extinction,btohqsg
üòÑ i know you're learning Russian. That's why you're thinking about languages,btohqsg
üòÜ probably dialects seems along the line,btohqsg
I thought China do have this issue,btohqsg
Actually the dying dialects like Hakka..shanghainess,btohqsg
Manchu language in China is not popular and barely have anyone speaking them,btohqsg
aya simple lah just whack a app.,btohqsg
the tys of PW is always have been a app,btohqsg
thats why now got any issue right  gahmen just whack app,btohqsg
You mean a learning app for near extinct culture ?,btohqsg
sure.. conceptualize first  don't worry about the implementation.,btohqsg
anyhow draw on paper show your team mates. make more brains work,btohqsg
cmf got disagreements but it is better to have them right at the start,btohqsg
Jc rarely is about implementing   only if in Poly we have to worry about implementing,btohqsg
But the idea itself cannot be ridiculous ofc,btohqsg
ik PW no need implement  but somehow some people still worry and fixated on implementation.,btohqsg
but yeah  just run wild  not on yourself but with your mates,btohqsg
tbh everyone will settle on a app in the end lmao,btohqsg
Think need to prototype right ?,btohqsg
I not sure how jc pw work but in Poly we have to have a prototype first,btohqsg
Which can be done using mobile app prototyping tools,btohqsg
LOL how are they gonna have a cannon event :/,btohqsg
cca shld be fine  but outside school is btr,btohqsg
if they don't elab it's hard to know what they mean,btohqsg
but they mainly want to exclude your normal acad curriculum,btohqsg
talking about cca in a way that makes sense is better than pulling smth out from nowhere that doesn't,btohqsg
Sounds like a human right issue,btohqsg
My parents dun have much education so they allowed me to choose my own path myself which is Poly route .... I told them I want to be able to work in computer field after graduation so Poly is the only choice that is feasible for me,btohqsg
we have no rights  we have no say and we long to be free one day,btohqsg
