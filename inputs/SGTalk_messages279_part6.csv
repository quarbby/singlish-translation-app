tbh living outside on your own can be a liberating experience,btohqsg

Well I remember when I was like 12 yr old  when I don‚Äôt know how to go home by bus and lost my way  after 2 hr I manage to get home  sadly my mum punish me and kick out of the house naked for 5 day -.-,btohqsg
ohh then after ns then revisit the idea,btohqsg
Lucky is all in the past,btohqsg
To be honest  that time I was very scared when I lost my way home,btohqsg
I think now cannot like this alr,btohqsg
Now I not sure  when in the past it happen,btohqsg
Honestly in overseas most kids got kicked out of the house when they are like 21. N they stayed on their own or rent a room,btohqsg
