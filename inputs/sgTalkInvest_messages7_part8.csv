Good evening I am Josef and I have positive experiences planning for my future from a person called Stacy Tham. She helps working professionals and aspiring investors like yourself to diagnose inefficiency in your existing financial portfolio(if you have any) and  do strategic allocations to speed up your financial journey. So basically how to better channel your money in different areas!I found the sharing super beneficial & insightful  I have picked up a lot of investments knowledge from her too  very different from those bankers and financial advisers I've met.She is really friendly so it was like a casual conversation! So I personally recommended you to him. Hopefully it can benefit you too.If you want to know more just ask me anything and I will reply you. We can go out to meet up if you want to also.,btohqsg
Hey guys! I am not sure if this is the right group to post in but I am leading a blockchain based project(not crypto) and we have been offered some large EU funding but we want to test the water on private investment instead. It‚Äôs a pretty interesting project which may spark some interest with the crypto community! Would this be a good place to talk and discuss? (To reiterate this is not a crypto project but does use some blockchain technology),btohqsg
Hello! May I know if anyone knows what is/are the procedure(S) to remove name from hdb ownership?,btohqsg
Anyone wants to know how money can work for you?  It may sounds like a scam  but its not. Pm me for more information and I will explain it to you.,btohqsg
Share here will benefit more people,btohqsg
I got to warn you guys that it isn't related to property.About 5 months ago  I had attended a seminar and I realize one thing. Money is actually easy to get if you allow it to work for you. Currently I am investing in mutual funds. It may be slow but once I retired at the age of 65  I will have at least 2 million for my retirement.How will I get 2 million by mutual funds you may think. Basically  I just put in about $500 monthly for the next 30 years minimally and I will easily get $2 mil.To me this idea  is actually very good as I wouldn't need to worry for my retirement.Those who are below the age of 25  I urge you to start investing as it will benefit you.,btohqsg
U should scroll history and find how many pple shill ILP policies,btohqsg
