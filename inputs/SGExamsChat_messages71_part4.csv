eh yea their content is fine,btohqsg
we've asked them nicely to stop promoting like about 10ish times now,btohqsg
Like if you ask for permission we're usually aight if it's for a good cause,btohqsg
But they don't even ask for permission,btohqsg
Usually Japanese are very hardworking leh but they do expect the same of you too!ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
U see each year got a jap win Nobel prize  minimum one,btohqsg
i assume acceding nicely to requests is a function of your ability to not be a douche but i'm unsure if they possess that capability,btohqsg
Like their population not super large but they win so many prizes,btohqsg
Compared to China and Korea for instance,btohqsg
i assume the sgcovid and sgeducators people are the same la,btohqsg
eh 200m is pretty large what,btohqsg
+ they industrialised early so they'd have more time to develop that kind of scientific culture that is needed to cultivate Nobel laureates,btohqsg
telegram is generally shit for modding tools,btohqsg
report so many times alr they also haven't done anything,btohqsg
tbh the most annoying thing is when they add people to their group,btohqsg
they scraped the entire members list the other time,btohqsg
AFAIK to shill the owner's GP tuition services,btohqsg
Omg I was added in too,btohqsg
Makes the group seem bigger lor,btohqsg
Tbh our Tele also low-key a paper tiger,btohqsg
2142 members but usually like 20-30 active,btohqsg
Omg that is unethical leh like having a veneer of altruism,btohqsg
any other factors you think are responsible,btohqsg
I think their emphasis on education also contributed,btohqsg
IIRC pre-meiji Japan had q a high literacy rate too,btohqsg
+ they instituted a system of national compulsory education early,btohqsg
i think gp tuition is like the least worth it out of all tuition services tbqh,btohqsg
Japan is 120 million and Australia 25 million population.  I think they are doing equally well though Australia is much smaller but I guess the sad thing is China and Korea dont really invent or discover anything worthy of a Nobel prize...,btohqsg
I guess Japanese also... have more connections with the west?,btohqsg
language could be a factor too,btohqsg
if English isn't your primary language it might hurt how international your connections are,btohqsg
Possibly could limit research quality because it limits the amount of collaborations you could do,btohqsg
Eh I think give china time,btohqsg
Like Nobel prize is a western thing not too surprised the west has some advantage? Counter to that is you see most textbooks is mostly western names being quoted. Asians rarely come up with some important theory or concept,btohqsg
They've lost a generation because of cultural revolution,btohqsg
I think China just needs time to catch up!,btohqsg
Korea only industrialised in the 60s-70s compared to Japan,btohqsg
I guess one big factor is that asians tend to focus more on money and practical stuff . Innovation needs patience and passion... so I guess westerners have that culture of passion and curiosity. Putting money aside,btohqsg
I think they need more time too,btohqsg
Plus I've heard from Korean friends their education system/unis arent particularly renowned,btohqsg
But this one need to see the allocation of research grants,btohqsg
It's kinda true for SG I feel,btohqsg
Like u see our healthcare implementation is very good. We dealt with covid patients very well compared to the western countries.. maybe asians are better at application rather than innovation. But time will tell once China catches up technologically,btohqsg
Usually my sister makes the cake  idk Iâ€™ll look for her recipes later,btohqsg
Like focusing more on practical research than novel research,btohqsg
What temperature/ wattage did u use?,btohqsg
Basic science research in sg is not very good I think,btohqsg
depends on what you value :?,btohqsg
"from a nation-building perspective it's good because you're not ""wasting"" money per se",btohqsg
the resources you spend are those that improve your industries/competitivity,btohqsg
