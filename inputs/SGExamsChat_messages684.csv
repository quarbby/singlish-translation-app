i actually had interview to prep for but chose to scroll through all my numerous jc chats,btohqsg
and actually in so doing  i read through my chem cher being so done about people in my class and then be like chasing for homework and asking people to buck up / seek consultation lmao,btohqsg
it is funny coz i think when i was in j2  i probably ignored those messages,btohqsg
'these are way overdue  please stay back tmr if you dont have cca. If you are struggling  I can stay back with you',btohqsg
For real at the very least we deserve student rates,btohqsg
I rmbr in south korea ppl in the military have like a separate door where they can enter the subway for free,btohqsg
They stay in for 2 years,btohqsg
But tbf i think we had it better,btohqsg
anyone enlist earlier than u can tekan u,btohqsg
How can they not be allowed to leave camp for 2 years at all though,btohqsg
I thought you meant they have to stay in camp for 2 years straight,btohqsg
But at least for the time they’re allowed to leave got free subway,btohqsg
Ok my bad its 18 months,btohqsg
Ya but my point is NSFs should have concession fares that are at least as low as student fares,btohqsg
The single fare trips are adult fares which is super expensive  and even the slightly discounted hybrid concession pass is more than 10% of my salary,btohqsg
Like at least our public transport is cheaper than most other developed countries around the world but like for NSFs given that our pay is measly we should have cheaper concession passes. Most working adults won’t be spending more than 10% of their salary on a monthly pass.,btohqsg
Maybe he can confirm if he had free public transport,btohqsg
lmao he actl can't catch a break 💀,btohqsg
Guys I will try to get U for h10 meal skipping,btohqsg
good but try actual meals and not a waffle,btohqsg
rn is chem lecture (doze off time),btohqsg
i haven’t gotten out of bed,btohqsg
For your phd is it like all the research work is done at home,btohqsg
You don’t have to go the uni campus,btohqsg
The moment i woke up i missed ps2 tutorial 🤡 (i didnt set an alarm),btohqsg
how did bro find ctk tele,btohqsg
He's been real quiet  ever since ..,btohqsg
i do theory research so i can do everything anywhere. if i did lab stuff then id have to be on campus,btohqsg
i mean some profs still want theory students to be in their office so depends,btohqsg
ctk is someone who frequently breaks rules unknowingly in sge i think,btohqsg
didn't he get muted a couple of times in discord,btohqsg
bro I don't even have discord,btohqsg
but idk why they keep tagging u,btohqsg
but this YT is accusing me that I'm someone else,btohqsg
isok lah YT can't even do anyt,btohqsg
i mean u say udh discord,btohqsg
how to prove u r not this person,btohqsg
yeah cos the sge discord is cancerous,btohqsg
according to every1 in this gc who is also in the disc,btohqsg
idk how being active in the tele corresponds to being another person,btohqsg
I mean it's not like you're that against being accused of being that ctk lol,btohqsg
The new Central Manpower Base  a one-stop hub for NS-related services  will be opened in phases from 2025.It will be located opposite Cashew MRT station and it will have medical screening  health and fitness facilities.https://str.sg/dXvY,btohqsg
Oh i heard vj’s waffles at concourse is v popz,btohqsg
It is the best thing in vj tho (maybe the ban mian too),btohqsg
if its like genuinely hurtful i'll tell him to tone it down,btohqsg
Remind me of the time when i even forgot about tutorial (and hv tutorial participation marks somemore),btohqsg
at least tmr is more chill,btohqsg
the couples always buy that then buy ice cream from the drinks stall then they eat waffle ice cream tgt,btohqsg
bruh can i just ck tmr,btohqsg
wait js to clarify  if you do math 2nd major/minor in uni  can teach maths ?,btohqsg
is the new jap stall ehe,btohqsg
suppose you do math as 2nd major/minor in uni along side a pri major (in this case  assume lifesci) would u be eligible to teach math in moe schs,btohqsg
you’d still need to do a PGDE under NIE,btohqsg
but if you have the pgde can right,btohqsg
yes like my friend in physics who got the MOE scholarship while in undergrad was asked to do a math minor to be able to teach sec sch math,btohqsg
sec sch usually they can teach two subjects,btohqsg
arrange the soccer balls in the same of a graph,btohqsg
"but isnt bio the ""furthest"" from math in terms of the natural sciences",btohqsg
screw bio  should have taken phys 😡😡😡,btohqsg
Also since when is pe a natural science...,btohqsg
Actl should I js screw everything and go NUS CS,btohqsg
MOTHER LOVE ME LONG TIME LONG TIME,btohqsg
i heard nowadays tchers in moe schs come frm alot of other professions. not necessarily they r fresh grads,btohqsg
Oh yea today i havent sent selfies,btohqsg
yes my friends phys cher was an engineer,btohqsg
you still need to do the PGDE,btohqsg
my math cher in sec 1,btohqsg
but he took pgde and teach phys,btohqsg
cause his wife give birth and he want to spend more time with kiddie,btohqsg
my cpa tcher was frm IT,btohqsg
like no matter where you come from or how old you are you need to go through NIE in some form first,btohqsg
but poly lect no need right,btohqsg
MOTHER LOVE ME LONG TIME LONG TIMESUCKY SUCKY FUCKY FUCKY WONTON HONG KONG  HONG KONG,btohqsg
cause the polys arent directly under moe no,btohqsg
math+physics the most common. almost all the math tchers tht i had in sec sch oso taught physics,btohqsg
cause physics is just applied maths,btohqsg
no need but that’s a diff thing,btohqsg
and chem is just applied physics,btohqsg
and bio is just applied chem,btohqsg
they either have quite a bit of industrial experience,btohqsg
or some have masters or phd,btohqsg
ite oso. my lects all came frm the industry,btohqsg
which makes sense since it’s more work related stuff in theory,btohqsg
actl isnt math js applied philo,btohqsg
oh js curious   whats ur course,btohqsg
btw i did titration today and my values were super close to teacher values,btohqsg
i think my sec sch js lack of tchers,btohqsg
@kohsyansec sch has a lot of siaolang teachers,btohqsg
got alot of my chers got weird ass teaching combi,btohqsg
fml y i wan be guai guai tell cher i need skip remedial,btohqsg
just tell cher ur on ur period,btohqsg
iirc math is js a branch of sci in uni.,btohqsg
then last remedial got a girl say she got tuition can go early,btohqsg
The article inside said BKT isn’t inside Malaysia’s top 30 dishes list though. Should’ve chosen some other dish instead,btohqsg
in some uni math is under bachelor of arts,btohqsg
usually bachelor of arts in math the math is like pure math oriented,btohqsg
while bachelor of sci tends to be more applied math in a sense maybe,btohqsg
but then for nus iirc theres only bachelor of sci for major in math,btohqsg
True one possible way would be to ask each race what dish is their favourite  then among the 10 dishes nominated give each race the number of dishes proportionately,btohqsg
Like if 20% of the population is Chinese nominate their top 2,btohqsg
idt being a cher means u got alot of free time,btohqsg
shld have chosen some other job,btohqsg
he said is less hectic than engineering,btohqsg
Well unfortunately over there since the opposition keeps on trying to exploit every fissure of disunity and keeps on playing up race and religious issues  they have to pander to the majority race/relgion else the ruling coalition will continue to lose Malay support,btohqsg
and also like in the first few years he mostly teach lower sec dnt (which is not graded) so is quite chill then he go back to junior high phys after his kiddies are older,btohqsg
A compromise would be to select a Chinese dish that is halal and also still popular among the Chinese,btohqsg
which is around the salary of maybe a sec sch hod ?,btohqsg
I think the hopes were quite high that the new PM will root out corruption but unfortunately it seems that nothing much is being done,btohqsg
At this point pretty much all the current politicians there can’t be trusted,btohqsg
Ya lol  but also Anwar needs Zahid to stay in power so can’t,btohqsg
Should i major in basket weaving,btohqsg
Also what are the chs fluff mods again,btohqsg
No actl right theres taylor swift module under lit major in us uni,btohqsg
Sg should have kurt tay modules as part of psych major,btohqsg
i js remembered. got 1 cher last time taught music and el,btohqsg
Actually it says in the article that the umno guy supported sth similar so we’ll see what happens,btohqsg
times like these are times i wish i were a girl,btohqsg
English and Music Geography and PE Math and Physics Math and PE Chemistry and Biology Social Studies and PE Geography and SS History and SS Math and History,btohqsg
rly tchers got alot of weird teaching combis,btohqsg
some r related to each other while some rly not related,btohqsg
Literature and Music English and Literature,btohqsg
prabably due to lack of teachers for particular subject,btohqsg
i think my sec school sci dept quite big but the math one quite small,btohqsg
cuz most sci tchers oso teach math,btohqsg
Geog (4 teachers) and PE (8 teachers) some classes even have 2 PE teachers,btohqsg
i think when i was in sec 2 i had 2 pe tchers,btohqsg
ye my sch is liddat for all levels,btohqsg
one teaching a new sport/game the other is more about the education and general fitness/nafa i guess?,btohqsg
"Israel's response to Oct 7 Hamas attack has ""gone too far""  but severing diplomatic ties would not help Palestinians  says Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.https://cna.asia/431Syth",btohqsg
plot twist WTH like so the hospital called and said that they happen to have a slot in 15min do u want to come,btohqsg
i kinda screwd up my only interview lmao,btohqsg
and HR was pushing me for it coz they say 'we are facing high applications but got limited vacancies  so im afraid if we filled up our places  we cant give anymore offer',btohqsg
and reasonably i freaking screwd up,btohqsg
with lots of broken english that i dun even know they understood what i was talking,btohqsg
oh man sorry to hear that but now just see how ba. don't just assume,btohqsg
but uh next time don't agree to it even if HR pushes,btohqsg
coz they are hinting that if i wait till tmr  i may not be able to get a place,btohqsg
ya i get it. just smth to take note of for the future bc the working day was alr ending so the diff between now and tmr morn wouldn't be much,btohqsg
stuff they say like that only benefits them tbh,btohqsg
it seems to me someone may have rejected them coz got somewhere else,btohqsg
idk to me like unless they straight up give all their offers on the spot  it doesn't make sense for you to lose out just bc your interview was scheduled <a day later,btohqsg
What if it's just an interview thing,btohqsg
coz i heard fr seniors indeed some places chose on fcfs,btohqsg
and sengkang only have got 7 places,btohqsg
but tbh only 1 of my prepared qns came out,btohqsg
ok not even 1  maybe half,btohqsg
what time was your original interview tmr supposed to be,btohqsg
i stupidly went to ask back  so slots are given on a fcfs basis?,btohqsg
and i dun think HR will lie about such things,btohqsg
uhh idk for sure but nothing is stopping them from lying,btohqsg
I mean no harm asking what you're just asking out of curiosity and to clarify,btohqsg
ok either way now just wait and see,btohqsg
true that i should not have pushed,btohqsg
i hv a pretty low interview success rate,btohqsg
and i dun think they are lying about high number of applicants,btohqsg
like in general it's a bad idea to take an interview 15 mins beforehand,btohqsg
esp if it's something you're not typically good at,btohqsg
fk malaysia bringing back ns 😭,btohqsg
it is a me problem not knowing the right thing to do,btohqsg
im malaysian with sg pr 😭,btohqsg
coz i wanted that too badly that idk if not accepting will lose my chances,btohqsg
HAHA FUCK IMAGINE SERVING NS IN TWO DIFF COUNTRIES,btohqsg
it’s smth you’ll learn. don’t be too hard on yourself,btohqsg
im just hoping for the best right now,btohqsg
in their fcfs logic  if i dun receive an email tdy  means im prob rejected,btohqsg
unless someone else tmr screwd up more than i did,btohqsg
im in no mood to go back to work,btohqsg
i think i was speaking too much singlish,btohqsg
but i heard its based on balloting,btohqsg
so i might not get chosen,btohqsg
One year ago  COVID-19 rules were relaxed as Singapore reverted to DORSCON Green. Singapore's health ministry has announced further adjustments from Mar 1:- Mask-wearing will no longer be compulsory in outpatient clinics- 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine are sufficient for essential protection  instead of 3Some of the vaccination centres still in operation will be closed too.

In my sec sch someone refused to give the form to the parents,btohqsg
my parents dont even know obs,btohqsg
In the end he didn’t go due to liability issues,btohqsg
they dun want me to go,btohqsg
my parents want me to touch grass,btohqsg
Then if there is a form just don’t sign it,btohqsg
so brought me to the doctor,btohqsg
but who is going to force u,btohqsg
Yeah but if parents don’t sign nothing they can do,btohqsg
Not like your Cher is going to come down to your house to force them to sign lol,btohqsg
You do not need to go to touch grass,btohqsg
I loved OBS altho after the whole trip ended up me going to the doc cause my skin act up,btohqsg

i was talking to singlish style,btohqsg
did anyone consider going to dis for ns,btohqsg
and im counting on these 7 places,btohqsg
by hr logic  if i dun receive an offer tdy  means high chance im rejected,btohqsg

The issue of drugs will also be extended in the school curriculum to other subjects such as General Paper in order to get students to think critically about drugs.,btohqsg

sue the gov for making his pinkie fracture while being captured,btohqsg
i wonder y sg gov havent adopt lethal injection yet. isit cuz hanging is faster and cheaper?,btohqsg
i always thought it was the other way around-- probably another misconception tsk,btohqsg
Man isn't that a grey area or smth,btohqsg
But if he’s been so easily manipulated once  then who’s to say he won’t be the next time?,btohqsg
Yeah injection is wayy more expensive,btohqsg
i mean is more humane to js inject someone rather then snapping their neck,btohqsg
And this method has a higher rate of botched executions,btohqsg
some people can change but some leopards (ppl) will never change their true colours,btohqsg
Then again depends on what kinda crime and it's severity/degree,btohqsg
yes but i think sg still wanna to let ppl have the mentality of dont fk w us,btohqsg
You know speaking of hanging  do you know there's like diff positions which the hanger can position the noose such that it is painless,btohqsg
Personally I’d say bullet to the head is the least painful way to go  not sure why they wouldn’t adopt that,btohqsg
Yeah they literally do math with the body’s weight for different kinds of drops  long and short drops or smth so that it’s as painless as possible,btohqsg
And it's really int because the hanger has been doing it for years,btohqsg
Pretty cool uk the factors they'd consider,btohqsg
I wonder if SG has a last meal policy,btohqsg
Maybe i should yap about death penalty for my gp assignment,btohqsg

Definitely should if it comes up  I just remembered reading all this in some model essay lol,btohqsg
"""Death row conditionsA 1978 newspaper article described the death row section of the original Changi Prison as consisting of 24 cells arranged in a horse shoe shaped block around an open air grassy exercise yard. The exercise area itself was enclosed in steel bars and had a wire mesh roof to prevent escape by helicopter.[93] Amnesty International reports that death row inmates are housed in cells of roughly three square metres (32 square feet).[16] Walls make up three sides  while the fourth is made up of vertical bars. They are equipped with a toilet  a sleeping mat  and a bucket for washing. Exercise is permitted twice a day for half an hour at a time.[8] Four days before the execution  the condemned is allowed to watch television or listen to the radio.[16]Special meals of their choice are also cooked  if within the prison budget. One documented last meal of an inmate was the last meal order of Tangaraju Suppiah  who asked for chicken rice  ice cream soda  nasi biryani and Milo-flavoured sweets before his hanging  while another was John Martin Scripps  who ordered a pizza and a cup of hot chocolate before his execution.[94][95]Visiting rights are increased from one 20-minute visit per week to a maximum of four hours each day [8] though no physical contact is allowed with any visitors.[16] In addition  two days before an execution  an inmate is allowed to have a photo shoot and be given their own clothes to pose during a photoshoot; the photo will be given to their families as remembrance.[96]""",btohqsg

Yes idk why am i even looking at my email at this hour,btohqsg
you gotta learn to compartmentalise and reason things out with yourself when you’re stressed,btohqsg
which parts can you actively do smth about? if future rounds are gonna be in crunch periods then isn’t it all the more reason to work now more so it’s easier later?,btohqsg
