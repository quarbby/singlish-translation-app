Did you choose ur jc subj based on what subjs you did well in o lvl,btohqsg
i did not take bio and dw lit so the real question was between H2 econs or H1  H2 or H1 phy...and i couldnt take 4H2. So in the end i took H2 econs and H1 phy (well u can say it is base on my grades in sec school)  and my phy honestly i was struggling with C5 consistently till miracle happened in Os where A2 appeared out of nowhere. and i like econs and was doing well in sec so i decided to take it at H2,btohqsg
My batch was actually the 1st batch where bio was taken off requirements of the healthcare courses,btohqsg
Is there anyone with no chem / bio background in Med sch?,btohqsg
Oh yeah must pass the BMAT or smth right,btohqsg
Pre-req is H2 chem + H2 bio/phy minimum,btohqsg
