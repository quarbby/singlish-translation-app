Hi gurus  was looking through my UOB lady solitaire statement. Is this automatic and non-waivable?,btohqsg
I hate to say this but likely all will cut again after September. Just don’t put all your eggs in one basket of assets.,btohqsg
Got  i think even medical related retail spend VS also give hence after capping VS den KF,btohqsg
Does it exceed 2k? It's still better to spend on UOB vs till 2k then UOB KF to absorb remaining dining spend.,btohqsg
Ur strategy seems fine. Only that UOB lady + amaze can't cover all overseas spend.,btohqsg
With your level of spend  I think ur income may be able to get UOB lady sol,btohqsg

For newly self employed/sole trader  is there a way to get around not having 2 years tax notice of assessment? Got rejected by Citi and Amex because of it. Even HSBC & Trust cc instant rejects I assume is because of that criteria 😂,btohqsg
Put 10k there in the bank 😅,btohqsg
I placed over 100k in HSBC after opening EGA this month  still gets instant rejection online 😂,btohqsg
I got two question1Normal bank give me credit limit of 1k to 1.5k but trust bank is giving me 11.3k. Is it normal ?2How does one get trust bank loan ?,btohqsg
Citi said no way around when I called them. Wonder if anyone have experiences with other banks,btohqsg
Hi there I am travelling soon  and my amaze card with Citi rewards is hitting 1k. What are the alternatives?,btohqsg
Look up secured credit card. 10k here needs to be put as fixed deposit. Not account balance.,btohqsg
Uob visa signature if you think you can spend more than 1k.,btohqsg
I think is related to the spending   vouchers will be unlocked after some spending.,btohqsg
Thank you! Will check out if the banks offered that,btohqsg
Indeed don't know hsbc ding dong strategy don't know how long haha,btohqsg
More than 3 years already. Although had a rest period of 3-4 months from my memory.,btohqsg
This 5 month fee waiver is for the 5k that is just deposited or the entire syfe managed portfolio ?,btohqsg
Hi there  is 4511 (scoot) a qualifying spent for HSBC LIVE+?,btohqsg
Checked this and it wasnt in excluded list. But they also didnt mention travel is eligible. So a bit confused,btohqsg
Not excluded but not in the whitelist for upsize cashback. So you only get base cashback,btohqsg
Ouh ok. So does it consider a qualifying spent? I wanted to cover the 500$ min spent for hsbc welcome gift.,btohqsg
Guys  for those who have successfully arranged to pay their cc bill by giro from their HSBC ega account  will you receive any kind of notification from either HSBC or the receiving cc banks?Also typically how long will this process take?,btohqsg
Usually GIRO processing SMS/letter from paying organisation (CC bank) and GIRO has setup SMS from HSBC. But failed applications also HSBC will also say GIRO has set-up (because their system is really stupid).At least 3 working weeks.,btohqsg
Their premier dividend+ is not bad if you are lazy with your money. Ocbc premier can also have access to highest gen spend card 1.6mpd but you should prioritize 4mpd cards anyway. Priority queue at ocbc branch is not bad.,btohqsg
Boss  ur ega giro settled already anot?,btohqsg
Wa like that also can  can call HSBC cso to verify?,btohqsg
Can use their chat to ask for all GIRO arrangements you have. It takes some time for them to understand what you're asking about but eventually you'll get there.For me I took 5 months to setup paying my DBS CC  but it took me 2 weeks to setup paying my Maybank CC. So good luck.,btohqsg
I remember it's long but didn't expect 5mths,btohqsg
Thank you  I've submitted for my UOB and Citibank CC last week 🙏🏻,btohqsg
3 or 4 times submission at least,btohqsg
What's causing the delay? Incomplete form? Wrong signature?,btohqsg
They keep replying wrong account number. But HSBC can reply me with the correct account number saying GIRO has set-up.,btohqsg
Got enough money in the bank  they give you card already. No need work also can,btohqsg
So at overseas  can i apple pay using amaze in my appleWallet? Or physical contactless using amaze?,btohqsg
Gurus  anyone knows what is the difference between UOB ONE ADDITIONAL REBATE and UOB ONE ENHANCED REBATE?,btohqsg
