@ChrisHMSGyou had the Philips smart portfolio video some months back. Are you still maintaining that? Any plans for video to update on the portfolio?,btohqsg
Not maintaining that ever since i started my automatic portfolio herehttps://youtu.be/4qO-9_S_FAo,btohqsg
Okay thanks.Like that OCBC 365 seems to be better for my use case.,btohqsg
Ocbc 365 gota higher min spending per month if u can march it then ok,btohqsg
My usual spending is abt 800-1000 per month.So I would think 365 would suit my use case better in terms of interest add onBecause I also have OCBC 360 but I‚Äôll need to really compare it,btohqsg
Ya ocbc bank rate now Damm goood,btohqsg
Ya that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm exploring to see how I can further exploit it.After all  I‚Äôm already crediting my pay to it.And also I wanna up my Cashback game üòÇ,btohqsg
Ya good u met their req,btohqsg
Maybe I‚Äôll just try out their card for 1 year then I‚Äôll see how it goes,btohqsg
Anyone here used to have Citi premiermiles visa and manage to get it exchanged for the Mastercard variant before card expiry date?,btohqsg
I had itI opted in for MC but they still send me VisaMy friend called up and asked to change  he had to close account and forfeit the miles before he can change to MC.,btohqsg
Just keep both Citi PM lah  4x airport lounge pass,btohqsg
Haha I‚Äôm not sure if it is possible to have 2 Premiermiles at the same time.Or it is possible?,btohqsg
I use revolut to draw out Cashback and withdraw cash in jb.So still useful,btohqsg
Just wanna be really careful  can I assume this ‚ÄúOther Spend‚Äù category for UOB ONE  is literally referring to other spends right? Not just overseas?,btohqsg
Yes  other eligible spend that don't fall under extra cashback.,btohqsg
Hi if I goings to buy phone at court/ challenger/ best denki will uob one card got 3% ?,btohqsg
U need to fulfill the quarterly spend requirement,btohqsg
Ya I will spend 500 or 1000 at least just want to confirm if buy from retail like courts will be under theirs McC,btohqsg
oh thats interesting  thanks for sharing!,btohqsg
there's a clause for min. 5 transaction of UOB one to qualify for the tiers  does supplementary card spendings count into the 5 transaction?,btohqsg
Yes sup card transaction count as well,btohqsg
nice! and thanks  sent in application yesterday. see whats UOB response.,btohqsg
looks like if spend on best denki / callenger / courts is mine 3.33 unless i spend on those they stated extra 10 or 15% catagories Up to 6.67% additional cashback1 on groceries  health and beauty and convenience store spend at Dairy Farm International transactions (Cold Storage  CS Fresh  Giant  Guardian  7-Eleven  Marketplace  Jasons  Jasons Deli) when you qualify for your quarterly cashback.or this daiy farm got extra 15%,btohqsg

any suggestions like i get uob one spend 1000 but if spend another 500 which other card to apply to get max cachback since now cant double dip using grab - spending is mostly on paywave retails shopping lesser on online   - best to have no min spend or lower min spend,btohqsg
I don't think any debit card have any cashback. No recommendations at all.,btohqsg
Depends on what your spending pattern is like. How much do you spend a month? Are you student  NSF  or working? What category do you spend most on?,btohqsg
can try uob one debit but mostly debit card got gimped benefit,btohqsg
Your UOB Card/CashPlus application(s) is/are successful. For assistance  visit the UOB website or call 1800 2222121,btohqsg
SC Jumpstart is good too if you're between 18-26yo. 1% cashback on pretty much anything  and can pair with Amaze,btohqsg
Not sure if it means my card or my UOB One account.I received an email to say my UOB ONE Account is open @ 0908h1000h I received this text. But I log into my UOB Application  there‚Äôs no additional card.I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll get rejected for this card because I already have a UOB Amex with them though,btohqsg
congrats just wait and login to uob app u should see the card inside but cant use first,btohqsg
Okay I‚Äôll see how it goes later  after my consideration for use case and my spending patterns I think UOB One is better for me and my wife  just the pet food every month already 300+ liao,btohqsg
Just need to track my spendings so I don‚Äôt fall between tiers,btohqsg
ya uob one got mine 500 min spend,btohqsg
Is there anyone facing issue logging in to Instarem app?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the in between I worry haha cos No Cashback for those spending in betweens I think haha,btohqsg
ya that why im looking at if spend 500 and if cantspend 1000 maybe look at another option like maybank visa $350,btohqsg
Previously when using UOB One  if I find myself in between tiers  I will go buy FairPrice voucher to get to the next.,btohqsg
That sounds like a good back up plan,btohqsg
but you need to hit it for 3 months straight. by then you might be over stretching your finance. not sure whether is it a good thing to do,btohqsg
what you can do is to get UOB One as your main card. Once you hit $500 change to HSBC revolution  use their reward point and get 2.5%,btohqsg
