Monthly AVG if not wrong. No harm to draw earlier. Just lesser interest.,btohqsg
Maybe only if you never participate I. Moneybull promo as a existing user,btohqsg
You should go to promotions click the promotion and scroll down  that‚Äôs how I remember,btohqsg
Apps don‚Äôt have the info  only Web has the info but web does not tell if it is only for new users or both existing.,btohqsg
I used already once moneybull promotion. If I‚Äôm eligible for 7% now I‚Äôll jump right in!!,btohqsg
You use the SGD 6.8% or USD 7%?,btohqsg
Anyone has recently done any comparison of broadband plans? What's the recommendation now? I moving to new place and I have always subscrube to min (currently using m1 500Mbps).,btohqsg

Hi gurus  I usually use UOB one card for Shell petrol  but this month I maxed out the quarterly cap  would you recommend using UOB absolute Amex cash back card or crmc or UOB PPV. Heymax recommended UOB absolute Amex. But I wasn‚Äôt sure  would you guys agree with Heymax?,btohqsg
For uob krisflyer  anybody have ideas how to achieve $800 krisshop spend every year? üòÖ,btohqsg
It's tough to be honest...I usually buy air tickets from SQ. It is better,btohqsg

Hi all  holding citi premier miles card   just wanted to check after get the welcome bonus and transfer to my preferred airline partner  there wouldn't be any penalty right?   This is what i saw in T&C If you no longer meet the Qualifying Spend within the Qualifying Spend Period due totransactions reversed / refunded / rejected  Citibank reserves the right to forfeit / clawback theWelcome Gift.,btohqsg
want to cancel the card as i hit the qualifying spend etc.,btohqsg
Hi bro! I have something to ask you haha. Between lady‚Äôs and krisflyer  which is better? Or just use both?,btohqsg
I used both. My UOB KF is my scoot booking card.,btohqsg
I saw review that bonus miles come in very very late.. can be more than 1 year,btohqsg
But if you flying scoot the 3mpd is on statement month not 1 year later,btohqsg
Hey   just a quick qn  for UOB evol card  to hit the $600 spending in a month  is petrol eligible?,btohqsg
Yes. For scoot  SIA  krishop  Kris+ will get 3mpd next month. Other qualifying trnx 1.8mpd is next membership year.,btohqsg
That's why I used it to book my scoot flight for the benefits. Other expenses are on other cards.,btohqsg
And if you fly scoot often then it worth the extract benefits by UOB KF I guess ü§î priority check in  boardmefirst and extra baggage +5kg if you purchase Especially if you fly out of busy airport  the priority check in wow  is a bliss,btohqsg
I continued with One Card  due to higher petrol discount. Use Smart Pay  not sure still got higher discount or not,btohqsg
Agoda which card card to use to earn best mile?Aside  seem like most cc give 7% discount on agoda,btohqsg
Sigh.. so long. Hahaha. I plan to use for other spends also,btohqsg
There are better cards for other spends thou.,btohqsg
For Agoda  UOB lady travel cat or dbs woman world master card are good,btohqsg
Psa: Uob fraud helpline is overwhelmed today (Saturday) if anyone kenna fraud and calling in. Ask for ‚Äúmanual verification‚Äù. If u use the system verification u will get bounced to hunting line and eventually cut off.,btohqsg

I'm experiencing payment error in Kris+ app while buying Gong Cha,btohqsg
I tot the $800 must only be on SIA  Scoot or Kris shop?Don‚Äôt think ANA will qualify for 3mpd,btohqsg
The person already spent 800 on SIA group. They are booking ANA viatrip.comso will get the miles.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs means the person book either a 1 way SIA and 1 way ANA or $800 on krisshop ?,btohqsg
"for the uob lady account if opened today with say 100k balance - does it apply 6mpd bonus on card spend for july ""calendar"" month or is it the july ""statement"" month?",btohqsg
Is it wise to put a lump sum into CSPX say 50k one shot ? And there after smaller amount every month on recurring buy?,btohqsg
Uob lady is all about calendar month.,btohqsg
Why you should upgrade from HDB to Condohttps://youtu.be/Vod8VU-fcY4,btohqsg
