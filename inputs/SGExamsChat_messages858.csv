üòÇüòÇüòÇ my friend asked me if I want to help sit move to new campus,btohqsg
"My reply is ""only if I get paid !""",btohqsg
Nope uh so I rejected his invite üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Besides I bet SIT have budget to pay movers well lol,btohqsg
I mean a damn university here,btohqsg
I worked at event before üòÖüòÖ there was a DEI conference held in sg and I was tasked to manage the event,btohqsg
Like the rate is quite decent,btohqsg
I was asked to manage the crowd control at scene and ensure the conference runs smoothly,btohqsg
is this worth it? saw an ad  registration is $28,btohqsg
i think you should check past papers,btohqsg
it's surprisingly pretty manageable  looks like O level type questions,btohqsg
a mix of chem bio and physics,btohqsg
idk if it'll be recognised like how SJBO is,btohqsg
the math section is nowhere near the imo,btohqsg
de moivre's theorem for complex numbers,btohqsg
yeah im afraid to do this and end up nobody recognise cus it's easy,btohqsg
am-gm and cs also not there,btohqsg
Not like it will be deducted,btohqsg
idw waste money LOL 28$ for useless cert,btohqsg
so better not? since the test lacking alot,btohqsg
might be good to put on tho,btohqsg
ur o level test same thing,btohqsg
I mean not like u will be on the streets or smth,btohqsg
Ahh US hosting science event sounds rather hilarious for me for all the wrong reasons,btohqsg
depends lehsome US competition can be damn hard,btohqsg
The public don't believe in sciences practically,btohqsg
Ironic for them to host such event,btohqsg
I mean if u get a good result btr then nth,btohqsg
okkk if I make it till the end can go Barcelona lmfao üôèüò®,btohqsg
nah I'm doing their science category  not interested in CS and math,btohqsg
I used to respect US as a STEM hub uh,btohqsg
I initially thought that US is a society scientifically literate enough to make decisions,btohqsg
Feel like just the media tends to exaggerate the extremes lol,btohqsg
I dw to ignite a war here but,btohqsg
Covid really must have disappointed me in how their public view sciences.... from reckless protest to lift lockdown early,btohqsg
Then their ppl also made decisions to protest against mask mandates in times of public health crisis when vaccination is on early stages ...  wow really badly damage their reputation fully,btohqsg
i mean sure but the public is separate from their academia side of things,btohqsg
I mean   sure   I use usa-made  vaccines and trust the manufacturing processes. The public behavior is beyond belief.,btohqsg
Is the new punggol coast mall üëª or not?,btohqsg
The saddest part is sadly not JUST its public. Their government don't even believe in climate change  especially in US governments from 2016 till now.,btohqsg
not rly  punggol digital district area used to be forested terrain,btohqsg
the üëª areas are mostly nearer to waterfront areas,btohqsg
the new SIT campus  punggol coast MRT & mall are still quite the distance away from the üëªbeach area there are boards near the Police Coast Guards that dig a little deeper about the park's history,btohqsg
Is it harder to get into unis when I'm applying during my last year of ns,btohqsg
Cuz I'm guessing other people have already applied and there's lesser slots left now,btohqsg
why would there be lesser slots,btohqsg
"every year its a new batch so the slots gets ""renewed""",btohqsg
There's already people who have been accepted to next year's class right if that makes sense,btohqsg
wait sorry yeah i didnt think it through,btohqsg
well idk but there's no point in questioning it  just apply,btohqsg
Looks like nus for eg tries to maintain 50:50 males and females,btohqsg
So as a guy it's tough üò≠,btohqsg
Isn't it roughly there based on their published stats,btohqsg
I'll quote the word  roughly there,btohqsg
because published stats are just for personal reference,btohqsg
Yea but afaik most guys already applied,btohqsg
So I wonder if they keep any slots open for people who apply towards end of ns or not,btohqsg
iirc from word of mout  unis will mostly prioritise male applicants who have finished serving 2-Yrs of mandated NS,btohqsg
the 50:50 gender ratio is honestly a misconception tho,btohqsg
a misconception that existed many years ago,btohqsg
It also depends on how well applicants portray themselves in applications,btohqsg
Also a question for how would students craft their portfolios,btohqsg
not just those currently in studiesalso applies to those adult learners who are wanting to upskill,btohqsg
How can one make their application and portfolio better,btohqsg
As far as I've seen there's a few short answer questions only and can fill up academic grades and achievements,btohqsg
i think i wrote carousel seller on my linkedln. learnt communicating with buyers and marketing skills LMAO,btohqsg
at this stage  it's quite hard,btohqsg
In terms of like writing and crafting it?,btohqsg
imo  the section on academic grades & achievements isn't always about school,btohqsg
it could be skill-relared  course-related or smth,btohqsg
"its mostly just categorised under ""academic"" because you're applying for potential further studies",btohqsg
types of academic grades are specified.,btohqsg
Is it realistic to get mech e with low rp üò≠,btohqsg
Yes  it's undeniable that you need to meet certain criteria/requirements for specified subjects,btohqsg
just check the cut-off RP points listed lor,btohqsg
"Tbh it rlly depends on your definition of ""low"" rp",btohqsg
i mean we got ntu aero falling 11.25 rp in one year bef,btohqsg
Wonder how 70rp will change it tho,btohqsg
Tbh i expected it to be much more competitive,btohqsg
Cus now the H1 contrasting subject doesnt have to be part of the rp,btohqsg
Which tbh among those who took the most non hybrid combis  they wld usually say is the subject they dont like/cmi at,btohqsg
So the only determining factor left would most likely be general paper,btohqsg
Mmm wld say probably  but unis tend to look at results first,btohqsg
But then now more ppl wld have max rp,btohqsg
if there are many 70rp ... hmm,btohqsg
i mean it's hard to say anything rn,btohqsg
They set the h2 syllabus harder,btohqsg
first batch is always the guinea pig,btohqsg
H2 Physics syllabus now got capacitence  quantum particle in a box  wavefunctions,btohqsg
I also wonder if they might instead make it harder to score an A,btohqsg
h2 phy now also got excel or smth,btohqsg
H2 Chem got nanomaterials and idk that is the only one i observed so far.,btohqsg
But wld say i prefer excel over drawing a stupid table.,btohqsg
This yrs A lvl first batch right?,btohqsg
eh the excel thing is genuinely good,btohqsg
More following the trends of current times,btohqsg
For those that did it with no excel  i.e. previous batches  they are only required to do 6 plot pointd,btohqsg
Idk if the excel one wld make them do like.,btohqsg
oh wait do we actually use laptops/etc.?,btohqsg
Idk what is their new conditiins,btohqsg
Idk how they wld test it tho,btohqsg
If only i was born 2 years earlierüò≠,btohqsg
i think they completely overhaul syllabus,btohqsg
Nah man  i rather be born 2 years earlier,btohqsg
u dont like the math & gp change ah,btohqsg
The batches before 2018 batch did pratical but like for 3 seperate days,btohqsg
i'm happy to never take a levels again unless it's for fun,btohqsg
Now all 3 experiments need do in the same day,btohqsg
is group theory for 16 year old impressive,btohqsg
It depends on their math backgrnd tbh,btohqsg
i'm applying to moe osap using group theory,btohqsg
I think it wld be quite impressive,btohqsg
i am studying Paolo Aluffi rn,btohqsg
people who just go through the moe system normally wouldn't even know the word group theory,btohqsg
Not even a h3 math student knows this,btohqsg
interestingly they study rings first before groups,btohqsg
i do not have any extra classes  only self-study,btohqsg
i mean you're not gonna find classes for that stuff outside of uni anyway,btohqsg
Wld say it wld be quite impressive,btohqsg
my main interest is actually exploring ways to connect group theory / abstract algebra with other fields in mathematics,btohqsg
seeing the Monstrous Moonshine conjecture (groups & complex analysis) and Fermat's Last Thm,btohqsg
Well wld say I have heard of ppl using grp theory for like molecules and crystalline structures that's for sure,btohqsg
that could be one point i can explore,btohqsg
Smth abt lie grp or idk,btohqsg
I'm not a math person haha,btohqsg
But have seen ppl in astar talk abt it before,btohqsg
Content might be slightly harder but papers are easier now. No more 12m planning qns  time pressure slightly reduced since it‚Äôs 75m each for p2 & p3 and 50m for p4 now  and a slight reduction in the proportion of marks allocated to higher-order thinking skills,btohqsg
Every year the 12m planning qn is poorly done lol,btohqsg
I still hate the fact they change gp from 12 qns to just 8,btohqsg
hmm also a lot of quantum logic gates form abelian groups,btohqsg
probably to reduce spotting and encourage ppl to actually build up knowledge in various topics,btohqsg
I find that quite questionable tho,btohqsg
Idk it's really odd because the paper is more supposed to focus on like language skills and how you form an arguement and such,btohqsg
Not about how much you know,btohqsg
but at the same time it trains you to actually become a world citizen,btohqsg
But wld still highly recommend choosing 5 topics for gp that you are interested though,btohqsg
And then just build up from there,btohqsg
I think for mine i rmb just focusing more on the arts and education topics but not on the politics and ethics topics lmao,btohqsg
"it;s not really just ""language & argumentative skills""",btohqsg
It's also:- Understand better the world and themselves by fostering a critical awareness of continuity and change in thehuman experience- Broaden their global outlook and deepen their understanding of local issues as well as how issues of regionaland global importance relate to Singapore,btohqsg
"I mean of course is not ""just"" that uh",btohqsg
there's a reason why gp there is more mark weightage to content,btohqsg
I mean of course there is that uh,btohqsg
But still it doesnt make sense to have lesser qns and lesser options to choose from*,btohqsg
GP is the art of bullshitting and YappingEnglish is the art of fluffery,btohqsg
i guess they want people to understand a wider range of issues and not just know and spot just 1 or 2 topics which is likely to come out in the list of 12 qns,btohqsg
English Compo u need to write it in a specific structure. GP dun care one,btohqsg
I have never heard of any one just focusing on 1 topic,btohqsg
For GP I know some focus on a specific niche like for your society questions or smth,btohqsg
Oh that one is cus they have no choice,btohqsg
"The application qn always be like ""in your own society"" so must write ""in your own society""",btohqsg
Some don't like reading news so they take the gamble lor,btohqsg
Things like arts is quite a common specialisation but then when they say in your society u gg,btohqsg
Singapore arts society is ded lmao,btohqsg
But studying 5 topics doesn't rlly feel like gambling tho...,btohqsg
Ideally u choose a topic most don't choose. I preferred choosing the legal ones like death penalty and the unjust punishment questions,btohqsg
Either ways is separate from English as you get to write critically instead of recite,btohqsg
here we have some ppl banking on 1 topic,btohqsg
It is very dumb that they focused on just 1 topic,btohqsg
I dont think they are focusing on 1 topic to gamble,btohqsg
I think they are focusing on 1 because they dont have enough time to study,btohqsg
And funny enough the topic i banked on didnt come out anyway,btohqsg
idr what i did for gp,btohqsg
I mean i did bank on one topic that didn't come out but i was still able to write the question i did because of all the daily news reading one has to do for gp,btohqsg
before you even typed that i took out the cup noodles alr,btohqsg
I add a raw egg to my cup noods,btohqsg
i saw on mothership that someone buried an 19 yr old teenager on punggol track 24 in 2007‚Ä¶ police managed to find culprit after decades,btohqsg
hi guys  i need a little help with this : i am an A level graduate and willing to take H2 Chem and H1 GP  tuitions (and i am sure i can teach well :) but i dont know how to find students...yalll have any tips?,btohqsg
this sounds like alcohol brewing lol.,btohqsg
the names are super funnybut they are actual theorems with long proofs,btohqsg
funny question  is failing GP in SG A-Levels == unable to get official A-Level cert?  Because in Malaysia it is for STPM  or atleast just tank your CGPA.,btohqsg
no you just need a pass in one A Level subject to get the cert. But failing GP will tank your overall score by a lot.,btohqsg
Also if u fail you will need to do some equivalent English mod in university anyways.,btohqsg
if u get A you can get exempted from Writing and Reasoning if you go to SMU.,btohqsg
oh  because Malaysia  you are required to pass GP with atleast a Grade C and above  in order to enroll into Local Malaysian Public University.And the GP paper is in Malay with shit tons of study materials to cram for.,btohqsg
Therefore  I opt-ed out and went to Cambridge A-Level locally during my time. üòÇ My Malay c.m.i....  No idea what's our Malaysian Education Minister die die emphasis on passing pointless subjects to get official certs.,btohqsg
seems reasonable  because I seen on RedNote  alot of China PRCs studied Singapore O-Levels/A-Levels  either scored badly/failed English or G.P.But other grades are all As lol,btohqsg
Uhh China do teach English uh,btohqsg
Chinese education system is quite a competitive btw,btohqsg
I think it is more of an issue with Chinese PRCs in Singapore within the struggling with the local English school system.,btohqsg
Like their Math paper even Oxford students find it a bit tricky to do,btohqsg
I think China English more on Vocabulary things.,btohqsg
that's one really my brain hurts reading their papers. lol.,btohqsg
But when Chinese students try US SAT Math    most find it very easy,btohqsg
Provide the person understand the paper or mock test,btohqsg
Or the mock test is translated properly ofc,btohqsg
pretty sure to sit for US SAT Maths  you only need to have O-Level Maths knowledge + calculator.And it's mostly multiple choice?,btohqsg
US folks need to go through another year in College for Foundation before specialization in their Degrees.,btohqsg
anyhow  those interested in free Coding Course with Zero Knowledge. Seems like 42 Singapore is somewhat getting popular. :),btohqsg
Create instagram page or something  ask your friends to spread around to their siblings or juniors. Offer free trial class for people to have a taste of your teaching first. Prepare materials baring your logo so that people can attribute your tuition back to you etc etc,btohqsg
Hi  any advice on learning filmmaking in Singapore WITHOUT going to school for it?,btohqsg
Think some media company got training partnership of sorts,btohqsg
You just need wait for them to announce they gt training programme of sorts,btohqsg
intern at some companies. can try jht company since minimum age is 18 yrs old,btohqsg
Prepare 80 dollars per month as if you want self learning is possible   gt online video that teaches this,btohqsg
You need a computer that has horsepower needed to support video editing and software like Adobe video editor tool which I estimate will cost 80 dollars per month assuming you go for subscription,btohqsg
As for how I know  my school got purchase Adobe creative cloud license for me  as IT student   I have to use photoshop,btohqsg
That's great ! But you need apply using school email I think,btohqsg
or for a start  get those online softwares with cloud processingeg flixier,btohqsg
Already in the Blackmagic Davinci Resolve ecosystem,btohqsg

1.5k for that is a spit in the face LOL,btohqsg
thats why its funny to me LMAO,btohqsg
i made more than that as a fresh phd student,btohqsg
I'm not worried about the technical equipment  I'm more worried about getting the locations and actors,btohqsg
Uhh actors a bit hard to solve uh,btohqsg
Location uh wait you filming drama as plan uh ?,btohqsg
I've heard overseas about guerilla filmmaking but I don't know if it's workable in the SG context,btohqsg
i heard smart locals & wah bananas have internships too,btohqsg
I came to do physics not do business,btohqsg
i did both physics and bio,btohqsg
i hv to say bio is easier,btohqsg
Physics is life. It's what powers the phone you are using,btohqsg
No life for the next 2 yearsüôè,btohqsg
no life for a future life üí™,btohqsg
I still think jc time is the most memorable 2 yrs of my schooling life for me personally,btohqsg
Oso 70rp system seems so unpredictable,btohqsg
Tons of ppl will get straight A‚Äôs tbh,btohqsg
but they won‚Äôt study locally unless for medicine/dentistry,btohqsg
Ill look for the fmath cher tmr,btohqsg
If cannot i oso dont rlyyyy mind,btohqsg
new P syllabus is tougher than old one I think,btohqsg
Was also abit hesitent on the workload of fmath,btohqsg
Tbh is more common that JCs have FM or Computing.,btohqsg
They did list it as a subject combi,btohqsg
But i think u can still try to talk to the fmath cher,btohqsg
later they go... oops it was a mistake in the system,btohqsg
But i wld say that high chance he might say no,btohqsg
Tbh i rather do PFMl hahahaha,btohqsg
But i decided to do chem lmao,btohqsg
I didnt rly like the blind memorisation,btohqsg
I can't remember. I only know I always hit >90% for it,btohqsg
Somehow i scored higher in C than P,btohqsg
Even tho i liked P more lmao,btohqsg
not liked it because it's interesting,btohqsg
Actly wat if i just throw my E,btohqsg
P sorts of just slots into my life one day,btohqsg
H2 E is most useful years after grad,btohqsg
only if u can get A for the remaining,btohqsg
U cant rlly throw out a contrasting subject,btohqsg
I cant drop X or M,btohqsg
don't bet on your luck until promos,btohqsg
Unless u mean like ignore uh,btohqsg
P i kimda need since engineering/cs in uni,btohqsg
M very easy to score A,btohqsg
I not sure for X but I thought looks easy enough,btohqsg
They only allow drop if u fail or smth,btohqsg
easy  but you still need the discipline.,btohqsg
go for it if u can handle,btohqsg
Actually I am more confused hahahaha,btohqsg
u never know if u decide to take double major in uni,btohqsg
Or u can be like some australian uni,btohqsg
and if u can take and ace 4 H2s  go for scholarship applications next,btohqsg
but can only tell halfway into JC,btohqsg
Aim to keep my head afloat first,btohqsg
He still needa do well for gp,btohqsg
everyday look at mirror and psych up yourself.,btohqsg
Can is can uh but argumentative essay somewhat quite tricky,btohqsg
J2s going to approach their most stressful period,btohqsg
J1s only have 8 months to promos,btohqsg
Ye crazy how many dances my ogl memoriseüíÄ,btohqsg
first 2 months honeymoon period also,btohqsg
so 6 intensive months to promos,btohqsg
For us we just copy other ppl do,btohqsg
But maybe i not so discerning it looks decently in sync,btohqsg
Those were probably the most social months i had.,btohqsg
And then it all goes downhill,btohqsg
"Esp when ppl look for ""Exco positions""",btohqsg
I was lucky I took F Math,btohqsg
it‚Äôs ok you have years after jc to have a social life,btohqsg
I took engineering in the wrong era,btohqsg
You can do that in NS and uni. Oh wait.,btohqsg
last time no smartphones for distractions,btohqsg
Oh for me my social life peaked in JC lmao,btohqsg
shh I knew my wife from JC üôà,btohqsg
Think is possible to end up there,btohqsg
June i just play games lpl,btohqsg
the fact is you‚Äôre gonna need to pick how you distribute your focus,btohqsg
if you want your social life then you‚Äôre taking away from your studies,btohqsg
some can do it  some can‚Äôt,btohqsg
burn out is sometimes because time not spent efficiently,btohqsg
I wld do that.But they put my J1 midterms after holidays,btohqsg
there's insufficient stuff from JC to truly burn out,btohqsg
H2 Chemistry and H1 Econs disagree,btohqsg
it's heavy workload nonethelessbut wait till you see how people work 70+ hrs a week after graduation,btohqsg
Let me tell you i didnt even know econs answers can be 1 liners,btohqsg
I only found out on the day of A levels,btohqsg
I only understood what literature is about years after C6 for O lvl literature,btohqsg
Let me smack it for you,btohqsg
Wanted to take lit over hist actly,btohqsg
want to dig no need ask permission,btohqsg
And when asked my cher say ill check for any precedents and nvr heard from again,btohqsg
Honestly same. But is more of small class size and pure sci ppl cannot take pure lit  only a maths,btohqsg
Then they decided to intro combined lit for the next batch LMAO,btohqsg
no digging  literally the inside of my nostrils are so itchy,btohqsg
JC best timeNS also best time,btohqsg
I watch too much ah boys to men,btohqsg
my NS was good. Still chatting with NS mates everyday,btohqsg
thinking back  near to 22 years + liao,btohqsg
It shld the better one uh,btohqsg
Need worry abt the ippt stuff next yr right,btohqsg
But like I was placed in pretty much the worst unit,btohqsg
better cuz less things. But strong friendships typically forged when chiong sua together for 2 years,btohqsg
The 2nd camp one was cus the unit misappropriated manpower of my previous unit,btohqsg
That camp reflected how much I hated NS.,btohqsg
Like i was meh with it but it turned 180 degrees when i entered the 2nd unit,btohqsg
The third camp pretty much made my life a bit easier,btohqsg
But the 2nd camp was SO horrible,btohqsg
but reservist you should be nothing much also,btohqsg
Thank god I am not in the 2nd camp if I kena reservist,btohqsg
the 9th and 10th reservist  can really feel the age catching up,btohqsg
the new people come inwe can do things much faster and efficiently.but when come to carry heavy loads and walk  really still cannot,btohqsg
"I'm just happy I can ""technically"" say how useful my NS was",btohqsg
Is basically microsoft word and excel lmao,btohqsg
"NS chiong sua is about taking rifle go around fire universal rounds by saying ""bang bang bang""",btohqsg
But that is if you know what is your pes status,btohqsg
"Meanwhile me in NS:""Look I made a report :D""",btohqsg
I rmbed for my jc  pe was seperated btw the girls and boys,btohqsg
So technically we had a portion to focus on ippt,btohqsg
I think if I am not wrong  before the merger  the shirt was white,btohqsg
"But so far I have nvr heard of any case of ""pervertism"" in my jc before",btohqsg
I dont get the context but still funny afüíÄ,btohqsg
Dunno what I‚Äôm gonna do for reservist as I‚Äôm in the navy and my ship is going to decommission next year  I.e my unit will no longer exist,btohqsg
Like they replacing ships with new ships,btohqsg
Meanwhile my camp decided to build a effing building out of nowhere,btohqsg
I only want ORD and MR,btohqsg
Rmb to book your dental appt if you plan on pulling out wisdom teeth,btohqsg
can always trf u to infantry,btohqsg
Haven‚Äôt been in army since BMT,btohqsg
I dumped all my army stuff away,btohqsg
ya but can still hold rifleso can be infantry also,btohqsg
pls god no I have not worn camo since BMT,btohqsg
or they will just equip everyone with green,btohqsg
I will man mode as a 3sg,btohqsg
U know the sad part abt being pes e,btohqsg
You can only max until 3sg,btohqsg
Like they will give you the 3sg rank after bmt and that is it,btohqsg
But that is if you do well during their 5 wk vocation course uh,btohqsg
I had to do all the saikang like NDP and SAF day,btohqsg
The best part abt NS for me wld be not going for BMT for 2 mnths,btohqsg
BTW i am curious have anyone went ns first before joining jc or mi ??,btohqsg
So far  not my jc uh,btohqsg
I scared ltr instead of left leg i right leg or smth stupid,btohqsg
At most wld be those retaking A levels,btohqsg
In every NSF life  BMT is the hardest part,btohqsg
But after that  things go down,btohqsg
I think a possible reason to do ns first before getting jc entry,btohqsg
nah  that one typically is reversed,btohqsg
even if you change citizenship  is still need go jc then go ns,btohqsg
Now I studying modulus function and it is killing brain cells,btohqsg
well to be fair  mod function is from add math,btohqsg
How come they move up to h2 Math? üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
i also wondering the same thing tho,btohqsg
but i wld say mod function is not rlly the worst topic so far,btohqsg
Same for proof by induction   they moved it up to f maths üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
oh they moved that up again to h3,btohqsg
üòÇ you seemed to be stuck with the topic for a couple of weeks now...,btohqsg
* cries the memories in cambridge a levels *my brain stopped braining when I transitioned from subtopic to actual past year questions and I can't tell the difference between the usage of cross and dot product lol,btohqsg
Ngl doing math tys paper 1s before march was a damn gd idea,btohqsg
Since like by then all the paper 1 topics are done,btohqsg
ah Singapore only 1 variant of the paper.,btohqsg
oh  in the international syllabus.1 year  2 exams sittings  3 variants of the same paper lol,btohqsg
But to be fair  i think the uk system is quite diff,btohqsg
Is like their one got 3 yrs of high school,btohqsg
So they got more time to cover the topics,btohqsg
ah. Cambridge International hardly take cares of UK folks lol,btohqsg
it is marketed for those country  who lazy to build up their education system. lol,btohqsg
otherwise  is offer students an alternative education system  rather than their local Exam board lol,btohqsg
And then there is Singapore. The hardcore version for pretty much no reason at all,btohqsg
I wondered what happens if h2 math tests poisson distribution and chi square tests,btohqsg
Since to be fair bio also uses chisquare test,btohqsg
Mmm. In sg case  it kinda made the income inequality wider,btohqsg
unlike Malaysia  either the grading system is fucked up  or the Uni Enrollment system is quota based.,btohqsg
Like the gdp is good but,btohqsg
^to those take econs yall will learn this eventually,btohqsg
The poor and the rich are like increasingly far from each other,btohqsg
seems like a common thing worldwide.,btohqsg
Like i rmb saying to myself it wld be useful,btohqsg
But it made me not want to enter a business course,btohqsg
I only took it because i know i can find tuition for it if i ever needed,btohqsg
Ngl. I relate to this even more^,btohqsg
You aint about to find tuition for any other h1 subjects,btohqsg
why get tuition if either way gone fuck,btohqsg
But definitely not literature or cse,btohqsg
I wasted all my parents money to get Cs and Ds,btohqsg
Stopped tuition in src 1 cus i thought it was redundant.,btohqsg
Its good to reflect on your stupidity once in a while,btohqsg
Some survived a levels without tuition,btohqsg
Tuition is mostly good to get you at most a pass,btohqsg
that's just based on limited sample size,btohqsg
fact is in hindsight you can only guess how things would've gone,btohqsg
for A-Level wise  I think Singapore JC did kinda somewhat an OK good job for some JCs recorded lecturers and tutorials and dump them online lol,btohqsg
problem is whether student can brain the materials or not lol,btohqsg
or manage to Google and find them lol,btohqsg
i mean as a whole that's a relatively new thing lol,btohqsg
I think its not a very cut and dry thing to make an absolute statement,btohqsg
Even academically inclined students can benefit from tuition,btohqsg
That's why i mean by it can more useful for at most fetting you a pass or a B,btohqsg
Mainly the fact that they can get all their doubts addressed at a faster pace than asking your school teachers who are swarmed with all the other nonsense that isnt teaching,btohqsg
But i dont have very huge beliefs on it giving you an A,btohqsg
a pass and a B is a huge range,btohqsg
so that point isn't really saying anything,btohqsg
My point is that you cannot just rely on tuition alone,btohqsg
I mean thats a given point,btohqsg
i think pass to B is a more accurate range and i agree A isn't achievable from tuition alone,btohqsg
If you did and got A then i shouldve gotten AAA/A,btohqsg
all it's really saying tho is that tuition works to diff degrees for diff people,btohqsg
but if you wanna trace back to specifics  you're gonna be here all day,btohqsg
I mean of course i get where everyone is coming from,btohqsg
I feel Tuition Teachers jobs might be threaten with AI chatbox that regrugitate out data faster than teachers can.,btohqsg
Half yes half no on this one,btohqsg
just give it couple of years. lol.,btohqsg
Ehhhh considering how much im using AI to teach my own ass now,btohqsg
I am still think on whether to buy the full version of chatgpt,btohqsg
me basically ask ChatGPT/DeepSeek on prompt engineering a python script everyday to postprocess my company dump. /heh/,btohqsg
Bur i didnt buy it lol,btohqsg
Funny because my friend joke with me that im worthless because AI can probably do anything and everything that i can do,btohqsg
Not sure what my education is for,btohqsg
well  now you can actually find some meaning in your life. lol,btohqsg
Not much on the technical stuff,btohqsg
Once i find it ill let you know,btohqsg
It gave me a quarter life crisis,btohqsg
not just becoming white collar slaves.,btohqsg
It is making me question the meaning of life,btohqsg
Thing is  i really dont mind being a white collar slave,btohqsg
But the fact is that AI can probably do all of that in the near future,btohqsg
Ok tbh physics is technically meaning of the universe or smth shit like that,btohqsg
The only thing I can say is,btohqsg
hmm i'm not really afraid of being replaced by AI,btohqsg
At this rate I rather let them use AI to do lab report lmao,btohqsg
then what you be doing after you been replaced? lol,btohqsg
Yall dont wanna know what i have seen in sem 1 to make me feel that way,btohqsg
what i do can't be replaced,btohqsg
And do earn money by being a travel blogger,btohqsg
reminds me the horror era of people relying on Chegg for answers.,btohqsg
if they need AI to do lab reports  they don't even deserve to pass,btohqsg
They say employers reject all PES E?,btohqsg
i think you're thinking of PES F,btohqsg
Chegg answers - pen written  answer works sometimes seems unverified and wrongs.,btohqsg
I know of juniors who entirely do their lab reports with AI...,btohqsg
eh my experience is just mastering physics that people use it for,btohqsg
Omg lemmi tell you how stupid this thing is,btohqsg
doing COVID  we have take home exams,btohqsg
i hope they realise i can spot it. i just choose not to flag it,btohqsg
some people just upload the entire Exam onto it and paid someone to solve it lol,btohqsg
The ppl who have been saying pes E cannot be hired mostly come from SAF ppl,btohqsg
I dont think they do but yknow its more trouble if you bring it up ig,btohqsg
I think NTU/NUS had a similar case on a programming course.,btohqsg
Need to meet the person and all that,btohqsg
I nvr hear this except for EVERY. SINGLE. NS REGULAR.,btohqsg
Eventually the teachers uploaded wrong answers to catch students who plagiarized.,btohqsg
i mean the reason i don't is bc we can't technically prove it objectively  but almost all AI reports are full of errors that they may not spot if they're alr that weak in concepts,btohqsg
so even if i don't flag the AI,btohqsg
Mostly cus those ns regular ppl are life pes A to C kind,btohqsg
they're getting marked down for being wrong,btohqsg
like it's actually impossible to fail lab,btohqsg
I mean to be fair i dont rlly tell them to use AI uh,btohqsg
I have a junior who submitted all 5 lab reports on the last day of the semester and still got D so,btohqsg
"But not to ""write out"" lah",btohqsg
bc behind the scenes we place a cap on the max penalty for lateness,btohqsg
I have never seen something so severe before,btohqsg
Wdym wdym  like literally the last day of finals week then he/she chionged all 5 reports,btohqsg
I never seen someone actually do this,btohqsg
Dont ask me why he/she did it,btohqsg
Omg yall are exposing me to the dark side man,btohqsg
Basically absent from attending lab. And have no idea what the hell is the data lol,btohqsg
Meanwhile i had friends who can submit 2/4 reports and cry why they didnt pass,btohqsg
attendance is wtv. it's just the report submission,btohqsg
yea bc of the max penalty we implemented,btohqsg
I mean if it is by accident then yea  is normal,btohqsg
submitting is always better even if late af,btohqsg
wait iestin so did that person even do viva,btohqsg
There is no way submitting 2/4 lab reports is an accident,btohqsg
And even if you were  the lab manager can probably still close one eye and give you D,btohqsg
also lab is actually super lenient with extensions and being late,btohqsg
Yeah for the 2 that he/she submitted,btohqsg
Cus the lab partner rlly dowan submit his shit,btohqsg
as in the one that submitted last min,btohqsg
But something tells me it was a bad viva,btohqsg
So end up the other person had to delay viva,btohqsg
Omg you know what is worse,btohqsg
If the lab partner never even show up,btohqsg
Idk why people think its ever a choice,btohqsg
Like submitting half the reports needed and then thinking youll pass,btohqsg
Like if they told them im advance that they are not coming  sure okay,btohqsg
Person probably thought doing the bare minimum  2/4 reports is a pass,btohqsg
One motherfker just decided to not come school from wk 3 onwards,btohqsg
I feel like i know this person,btohqsg
Like not matriculate same yr as us one,btohqsg
The fact that this person remain uncontactable just made me feel speechless,btohqsg
Ok but ngl idk how I did well for lab,btohqsg
Like i know i am bragging here but,btohqsg
I am legitimately serious. I actually dont know what the hell am I doing,btohqsg
Im not looking forward to individual vivas in y3 lab,btohqsg
Ive always been carried by my partner in y2,btohqsg
What am i gonna say in y3,btohqsg
I dont know how to talk brah,btohqsg
Honestly I just yap with logic,btohqsg
I dont even know what im doing in lab,btohqsg
sure if you get full marks for both,btohqsg
So by extension i dont know what i can yap about,btohqsg
if you took my experiment  i'd have been ok with doing as a pair,btohqsg
I tried to convince my partner to do your experiment but,btohqsg
Omg who is the mtfker who told me is by profs viva : (,btohqsg
Im not even in the same lab session as sy,btohqsg
Physics in the industry took up my tuesday lab slot,btohqsg
Just not the same year lmao,btohqsg
He will be in morning session,btohqsg
We will be in afternn session,btohqsg
He is also doing y2 lab,btohqsg
you didn't read ntulearn yourself then,btohqsg
No leh someone told me that the TA is just the TA,btohqsg
And that we viva by prof,btohqsg
I know someone told me because I rmb,btohqsg
it's literally on the course page,btohqsg
Aite imma sleep because gotta wake up for some god damn bde weekly quiz at 930am,btohqsg
JC's orientation week normally so fun kah? Seems like first time see VJC students mass gathering at Fortune of Wealth. haha,btohqsg
School Headmaster need to apply Mass Gathering License to run this event ah? üòÇ,btohqsg
kinda surprised how many students studying for A-Levels each year.Because in Malaysia's STPM you typically won't see more than 50 students  with in a Sixth Form School.,btohqsg
My school organised running every week as normal activities,btohqsg
I think this is quite the tradition for vjc,btohqsg
Im not very certain but my vjc friends all did take pictures there before,btohqsg
But then reality is jc quite hard uh so ... the fun pretty short lived,btohqsg
would say that for uni too :/,btohqsg
hi im crashing out üíú anyone know how to memorise smt a day before ur exam üíú,btohqsg
Not us being y4s next year,btohqsg
I wld like that advise too,btohqsg
And the entire y4 i most likely wont be in sch,btohqsg
Did you find an intern tho,btohqsg
The portal just opened 2 days ago,btohqsg
Applied for everything alr  waiting to hear back,btohqsg
Worst comes to worst i go knock on elbert chia office,btohqsg
Oh god why elbert chia tho,btohqsg
Do you know how a truck can collide with a car?,btohqsg
This was at Suntec too  but they have shifted to Our Tampines Hub in recent years,btohqsg
Like more massive objects harder to put it stop,btohqsg
Well in sg we dun have railroad crossing already,btohqsg
City Harvest still owns the convention centre rite?,btohqsg
In country like UK  US  level crossing warning lights are often ignored so we often see trains colliding with road vehicles ‚ò†üíÄ,btohqsg
The driver think he can beat physics,btohqsg
Hmmm I actually don‚Äôt know leh,btohqsg
Compile into ChatGpt Or DeepSeek and make a chant you can sing and easily recall or acronym?,btohqsg
Just keep repeating it to yourself verbally until it sticks,btohqsg
Cries doing Engineering and Society/Ethics die die need to memorize code of conduct line by line in my uni‚Äôs module,btohqsg
But ysah singing is pretty good,btohqsg
Even right now a song is playing in my head for no apparent reason,btohqsg
I keep repeating lestin but doesn't stick,btohqsg
Thats because youre in my heart,btohqsg
Bull shit u have some girls name in your heart. Last time rumchel who isit now,btohqsg
I went to popular outlet and saw h1 tys on shelf,btohqsg
H2 ? Harder to print ?,btohqsg
Think strange uh the staff say need wait till March when h1 tys listed on stock uh,btohqsg
Does anyone have a pdf of a crash course on O and A level chem,btohqsg
Okay maybe A level chem i still have from like 2019 (not sure if 9729 changed at all since i took it) but i do need for O levels,btohqsg
9729 is still ‚Ä¶ 9729 no change content wiseThis year‚Äôs J1 is taking 9476,btohqsg
Is there any difference content wise with 9476 and 9729?,btohqsg
I wrote in the A level group before,btohqsg
Generally Addition:‚Ä¢ 2 topics‚ÄúOrganic Reactions and Mechanisms‚Äù (reorganisation of content/approach in a way) and ‚ÄúPolymers‚Äù‚Ä¢ details on R&C for organic reactions‚Ä¢ specificity of enzymes elaborated‚Äî‚ÄîSubtraction:‚Ä¢ mixing of particles in affecting entropy‚Ä¢ relationship between substrate concentration and rate of enzyme-catalysed reaction‚Ä¢ how POE is dependent on deltaGnaught‚Äî‚ÄîRevision:‚Ä¢ context of buffer: from blood to oceans (ocean acidification)‚Ä¢ definition of transition element (updated to include Sc),btohqsg
Anyway  syllabus documents are publicly available,btohqsg
Now i need to find a crash course for the whole o level chem syllabus again because its been a decade since i saw anything o level chem,btohqsg
Holy Grail should really saving a copy of the yearly examined syllabus.SEAB keepts deleting them for some reason.,btohqsg
you planning to tutor kids from O-Level syllabus?*,btohqsg
Interview for intern in a tuition centre lmao‚Ä¶ nothing is confirmed yet because I gotta go for a content assessment but I cannot for the life of me remember any Chem,btohqsg
I‚Äôm pretty sure I can pick it up again given the materials,btohqsg
lol Tuition Centers need interns nowadays lmao?,btohqsg
how much  they planning to pay,btohqsg
is it something like a Homework Support workgroup?,btohqsg
I‚Äôd have to find out more from them when I‚Äôm down there talking,btohqsg
But atp I just want any intern because I need to intern to graduate,btohqsg
lol. what's your field of work again?,btohqsg
U intern under me. E120 services,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have one  just need to do any,btohqsg
This year 2025 O-Level/A-Level Chemistry syllabujs.,btohqsg
You register under in place first,btohqsg
U submit the self source form,btohqsg
Lanjiao even submit form also wanna be picky,btohqsg
Oh hell nah my gpa would need to double to consider Astar,btohqsg
otherwise ask SiYan looking for lab assistant. lol.,btohqsg
Bro already had enough teaching me quantum mechanics,btohqsg
He probably don‚Äôt want any more of me,btohqsg
ahhh  I think well paid intern technically roles  maybe you can try like Micron / Global Foundaries / Jabil?,btohqsg
you got specialization in Laser tech or what ah.,btohqsg
If you do Theoretical Physics specialization idk where you would go  besides Research Center  Uni or Education Spaces.,btohqsg
First batch of students who learnt the new O level Chemistry syllabus (6092) took their exams in 2024 so materials for Sec 3 in 2023 onward would be helpful,btohqsg
my mentee is interning at a sec sch to teach chem,btohqsg
If its not much trouble i would appreciate that,btohqsg
The one where u get sent to schs to teach,btohqsg
yea tip does that but it doesn't have to be under that,btohqsg
I tot it has to be relevant to ur degree,btohqsg
"the school can be quite lax in terms of what's ""relevant""",btohqsg
Technically chem can be related to physics,btohqsg
