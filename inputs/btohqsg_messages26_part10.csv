I thought people move in already since sept 2024 is the top?,btohqsg
Can check what's a good site to filter for HDBs with 5 year MOP?,btohqsg
I use99.coto filter using ‚Äúbuilt year‚Äù,btohqsg
Filter your search > choose HDB > built year state 2019 to get the newest units that just MOP,btohqsg
Thank you! But am particularly looking to filter for flats with 5 year MOp  not just recently MOP,btohqsg
Ya you can choose whichever year you want.. means if you want HDB already MOP for 5 years  just calculate backwards. So can do 2024 - 5 years - 5 years = 2014. So you filter built year > choose 2014,btohqsg
https://www.btohq.com/plh-listFor now only PLH is 10 years MOP  the rest are 5 years MOP. For Oct 2024 BTO  classification of BTO type have to wait for launch,btohqsg
When does HDB normally announce next years launch dates,btohqsg
Depends if HDB is still keeping to 3 BTO launches - if so  can just use this year‚Äôs launch period as the gauge for next year. But no guarantee it‚Äôll be the same. Otherwise will need to wait for HDB to announce.,btohqsg
Those people that submitted HFE before 15 September  did you manage to get approval already?,btohqsg
I only know of BTOHQ - which is the group you are in. As of now  you can go to BTOHQ website and look for Prime Location Housing flats. These are all 10 year MOP. Prior to this up coming Oct launch  any other  flats are all 5 years MOP.Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any other website in particular that tracks BTO data‚Ä¶ but correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.,btohqsg
i just got mine yesterday after 5 weeks' wait. hdb will tell you that you can rest assured you will get your HFE before the oct launch  but best to call and tell them you want to participate in the oct launch,btohqsg

Balloting for an HDB flat next week?The first BTO projects under the Standard  Plus and Prime classifications will be rolled out for the upcoming launch.https://str.sg/G6g2,btohqsg
So bto will be launched next week,btohqsg
What's the estimated completion time for each project? Besides only knowing bukit batok will be within 2 years?,btohqsg
Not released yet  only at launch Only bukit batok and sengkang released as within 2 years,btohqsg
May I know if combined income is more than 14k for the couple  they cannot get HFE & apply for the BTO at all?,btohqsg
Can apply for HFE to know your expected loan amount for hdb resale purchase.,btohqsg
"Unlikely  HDB definition of ""waiting time"" refers to when u book your flat to key collection. Booking of flat for this exercise likely is around Q1 2025 earliest. So key collection likely Q1 2027",btohqsg
Ya. Still quicker than feb bto. Which top by q4 2027,btohqsg
Can't apply for BTO with more than 14k combined income,btohqsg
üîë Thinking about owning a home sooner? Start the countdown with us! ‚è≥More than 2 000 flats with wait times of less than three years will be offered in the October BTO exercise. Spread across three projects in Bukit Batok and Sengkang  there is a wide variety of flat types to suit different budgets and needs  ranging from 2-room Flexi units to 3Gen flats.Check out the projects and their nearby amenities.  üçΩüõí,btohqsg
Bukit batok will be hot project,btohqsg
Why? Cus it takes the shortest time to build?,btohqsg
Yes. And quite close to bukit timah. Mrt nearby project too. Nearby princess elizabeth primary and acs,btohqsg
I think the Pasir ris btos are gonna be in such high demand  being standard flats but near an mrt station etc,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt say Feb bto  even quicker than 2020 BTO HAHAHA,btohqsg
I remember yishun Miltonia bto need to wait quite long like 5 yrs?,btohqsg
Those who bto in 2027 will get house earlier than Miltonia BTO,btohqsg
That one. Lol. Take ages üòÖ,btohqsg
Wonder if the quality will be okSuddenly HDB can build BTO in 2 years*in 2024 election year üòù,btohqsg
Wish they could do that to all BTOs Why not they start build then start the launch to have shorter waiting time,btohqsg
Can. Why not. China build 57 storey skyscrapper in 19days. The longer the time the more they relax one. No sense of rush or hustling,btohqsg
I think they also start building already before launch,btohqsg
Is it confirmed that the Pasir Ris project near train station is Standard?,btohqsg
Plus or prime location maybe would be better investment since the amenities are much better,btohqsg
Need to factor in waiting time and mop length as well for investment.,btohqsg
Yeah and also they have grants so hope not so ex  just only need to care about the MOP,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know how much the subsidy clawback for prime and plus flats will be?,btohqsg
The amount will be made known when Plus or Prime projects are launched for sale.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/finding-a-flat/standard-plus-and-prime-housing-models,btohqsg
Any couples here w sch going kidsDo u list ur children as occupiers?If they r sch goingDo u need to upload documents to prove kid is in sch?,btohqsg
