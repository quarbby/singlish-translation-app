U mean home mortgage?Usually I call in and ask for reprice from the same bank. U save legal fees this wayRefinance is when you change bank for lower interestReprice is same bank but change plans for lower interest rateWhen you call for reprice just say you got a much lower quote elsewhereDBS and SCB is offering 1.86%Not sure which banks but the lowest I heard now is 1.80% now,btohqsg
Nah. Not necessarily. If u have the correct information to bargain  going direct to your bank for reprice is the cheapest because you save legal feesMortgage broker can never offer you reprice. They can only offer another bank for refinancing  so the legal fee they can’t reduce for youKey is information. Before you talk to your bank for reprice  if they know you know the lowest price in the market  they will match it or go closer.,btohqsg
