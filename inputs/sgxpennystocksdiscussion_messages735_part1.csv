The global energy crunch is not some fake news. Just last year even before Russian war  China and other parts of the world faced power shortage and blackout during the winter periods likely due to Covid-19 circumstancesNow  with the ongoing war in Russia  it have further worsen the ongoing energy crisisIn addition  Natural gas prices jump will have many nations turn to cheaper and dirty fuel in Coal especially since winter is coming and many are anticipation colder temperatures.GEO energy IMO are at area of value and yesterday T+4 over. Expecting it to power above $0.40 as Winter season approaches.Watch closely.,btohqsg
As long as the war is ongoing  the energy crunch the world is facing will still go on.In sg  we are the fortunate ones but out there  there are a lot of problems that we do not see.Coal would turn out to be the hero of the energy crunch IMO. Although it will lead to higher carbon emissions but would the other nations rather race intermittent power issues  blackout  people dying in the upcoming winter?No  it is simply not a choice now. Short term survival always beats long term.I won’t be surprised to ever see GEO energy above $0.60 honestly . (As long as the issue is global   anything can happen)I think this is the final flushing.DYODDSource:https://amp.abc.net.au/article/101652960,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 15 November 2022🎉💰Fed's work is unfinished; here comes the hawk💸The equity market turned softer on Monday as comments from the Fed's officials rekindled the fear of inflation. It gives the market a breather from the rally from the past week. While the October CPI has been weaker than expected  Fed Governor Christopher Waller commented on the long path ahead for the Fed to ensure its mission is accomplished. This signals more rate hikes and dampens risk-on sentiment.After all  the 7% inflation rate is still too high for a target of 2%. Hence  Pika World expects Fed governors to begin dampening sentiments of any form of Fed's pivot.💣Amazon: Finally  the cut is here🎯The e-commerce giant is expected to report a large-scale layoff  estimated to affect 10 000 workers. This comes amidst a review of cost-cutting measures  a familiar theme of tech companies these days.Rumours suggest that the cuts will hit the corporate employees the most and will likely spread to Amazon's device business. Moreover  it comes at a time when many MNCs are grappling with a slowdown in economic demand and facing dual headwinds: a higher interest rate coupled with a strong dollar.Pika World will look at possible entry levels for long-term accumulation in the tech sector.🎢What is Uncle Warren buying these days?💎According to the latest filing on Monday  Berkshire Hathaway is buying more of Taiwan Semiconductor during the third quarter while selling US Bancorp and Bank of New York. The company is also buying Chevron and  unsurprising  Occidental Petroleum.The key focus was on purchasing 60 million shares in TSM  the world's leading semiconductor producer.Does that tell us something?📮What's on the menu today?📖At 9.30 pm  we will receive the Core PPI for MoM comparison  which we expect to hit 0.3%. Likewise  the PPI for MoM for Oct is expected to remain constant at 0.4%.It is 15 November  Tuesday  at 8.56 am in Singapore and 8.56 pm in New York. It has been a swing Monday  and we hope Pika World friends have a profitable trading week ahead!,btohqsg
