NOT WET ITS THE SUGAR GLAZE,btohqsg
I think Oreo left the chat,btohqsg
Yea exactly  just making students unhappy and making matters worst lol,btohqsg
Yea prior there were a few pilot schools,btohqsg
I guess every system has their disadvantages  maybe streaming might have been better after all but we’ll have to wait and see,btohqsg
Their point is to make grades less important,btohqsg
My sis dun talk to NT and NA people in her class,btohqsg
She only talked to 1 person (and that person ultimately did well enough to switch fr NA to express in sec 3 lol),btohqsg
Not becoz of the stigma or whatsoever  some people are weird,btohqsg
Oh i tot u mean uni omo,btohqsg
Perhaps instead of mapping B3 to 1 point all the time  moe should come up with a separate grade boundary specifically for mapping G3 grades to G2,btohqsg
Oh wait so that’s why one subject can be treated as a G2,btohqsg
I thought it was basically the same as n level student taking sbb,btohqsg
ok tbh im actually wondering if this would exacerbate the divide between ip and others,btohqsg
cause ip is still going to exist,btohqsg
then later people may say ip is separate from the rest of the system which exacerbates elitism,btohqsg
I remembered my sis class got this dude anger management issue  then go and use fire extinguisher spray at teacher,btohqsg
I think suspended for a week,btohqsg
i was the opp. i was closer to exp ppl,btohqsg
Then another person caught vaping (and suspended for 2 wks or sth)  then his mum dun allow him come back to school (he even take the exam in the go lmao) coz the mum say the school is bad influence,btohqsg
honestly this ntg to say. theres always the stigma of na nt ppl even if u put everyone in the same class,btohqsg
My sis dun even talk to the NT NA people,btohqsg
Well what else can u say if it is proven,btohqsg
is always been exp look down on na nt  na look down on nt,btohqsg
But not all are like that  some is just cant study,btohqsg
But some is legit idk how to describe,btohqsg
even tho na nt is still normal stream,btohqsg
why? isit cuz she think they dumb or smtg,btohqsg
tbf this mixed class thingy gna cause some negative effects. bullying may actly get worse,btohqsg
Actually does this mean there are no more sch offering just express,btohqsg
All schools needa offer all 3 + ip (for ip sch),btohqsg
I only know my school is one of the 4 being forced to offer g2,btohqsg
Coz my sch was a 100% express school,btohqsg
No like behaviour  they are just weird,btohqsg
gotta be more open minded to ppl ngl. next working world how?,btohqsg
but at sec sch of course u r nt gna think so far,btohqsg
I thought we went way back,btohqsg
they think they stupid + other ppl say they stupid. what kind of effect u think they r gna have,btohqsg
I cant really say but apparently she say got this autistic kid in her class,btohqsg
Then again i be like ‘u freaking hv an autistic brother at home  and u complain about ur classmate’,btohqsg
tbf my sec sch class got alot of stupid ppl inside. not stupid cuz they dumb or what but stupid in the sense tht they r smart but dowan study. i legit got see my classmates go downhill after sec 1.,btohqsg
+ an autistic person in mainstream is prolly higher functioning than autistic person in a SPED sch,btohqsg
my class also got. honestly ntg to do so gotta live with it,btohqsg
he abit weird weird one but quite smart,btohqsg
But i think students wise  they are just sec sch and also ppl like me picky w friends,btohqsg
u dunnid to be frens wif them.js like make sure u can work tgt,btohqsg
So i dun see how this gonna help reduce stigmatisation tbh,btohqsg
But it calls for free loaders,btohqsg
She just freaking remove that person’s name,btohqsg
I'm going to SNAPS at this rate,btohqsg
