38kkm by the latest owner maybe,btohqsg
The car too ex so he leaves at the carpark for exhibition 38k should not come as surprised,btohqsg
Either car ex or repair cost too ex,btohqsg
BMW wor one of the 3 worst car to maintain,btohqsg
Wah admin.. 335i shoik leh .,btohqsg
Put a 1 in front maybe believable,btohqsg
Owners 6  actual count 3  38.5k mileage. So many red flags üö©üö©üö©,btohqsg
This is the exact sort of cars we are warned not to buy ü´†ü´†,btohqsg
Dun trust all these nonsense dealers,btohqsg
Every dealer is out to scam you. Do your homework,btohqsg
I think restaurants are also scammer. 1 whole Cabbage 50 cents. Sell u half of it at $12,btohqsg
Extra 3 due to COE renewal and car plate retention> what the hell does this even mean? Last i checked  renewing COE and retaining plate does not change owner count. that car and that ad is a walking red flag,btohqsg
More ex to maintain as compared to  honda? Yes,btohqsg
I think it is reliable. Any car can be reliable.. or not. Up to owners.,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt buy a performance car then cries when FC not great or more wear and tear issues to take care of when one drives car harder to enjoy the performance.,btohqsg
+1 and Agree. You‚Äôre the most reliable ü•∞,btohqsg
Sgcm admin doesn't screen one meh?,btohqsg
U all never consider 1 thing‚Ä¶. Maybe rebuild engine / change engine thats why mileage low,btohqsg
Mileage readout doesnt change if you change the engine,btohqsg
Guys  wanna ask A8 more reliable compare to 740?,btohqsg
I think retain carplate will add owner count de leh,btohqsg
I‚Äôve seen more 7‚Äôs than A8‚Äôs in upscale estates but that‚Äôs not to say A8‚Äôs inferior? As much 7‚Äôs I‚Äôve seen  there‚Äôre a number of them with faulty air susp,btohqsg
Take S class better or LS500,btohqsg
If have enough dough to buy A8 or 740 reliability not a concern anymore... Just buy whichever car you like driving more lol,btohqsg
No to both. I have done both and neither added to owner count,btohqsg
What adds owner count? Change to bidded vrn?,btohqsg
not that either  have done that too,btohqsg
Lamborghini heads to Oman for some Arabian magicThe latest Lamborghini driving experience sees a convoy of the Urus S Super SUV driving through the roads and sands of Oman.‚û°Ô∏è Read itHERE!,btohqsg
I remember if u take a loan for coe renewal  it adds one leh,btohqsg
My dealer told me that also,btohqsg
Transfer to dealer is considered one count right? Then dealer to new owner is another count?,btohqsg
Or transferring to dealer is nt counted,btohqsg
LOL thats between you and the loan company. Not how it works when you actually extend. Kena con. I renewed coe myself‚Ä¶twice‚Ä¶and it never added to the owner count,btohqsg
The guy giving loan probably did some funny thing to ensure he didnt pay for your renewal then u run away,btohqsg
If some guy ask me add owner count to my vehicle to renew coe i would ask him to get lost and find someone else,btohqsg
Anyway this is easily proven. There a lots of single owner cars more than 10 years old. Meaning coe renewed  no addition to owner count. Here is just one examplehttps://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1244220&utm_content=SLeligible,btohqsg
This from SGCM. Coe renewals thru finance companies incur an additional owner count,btohqsg
https://www.straitstimes.com/business/no-one-wants-used-evs-making-new-ones-a-tougher-sell-tooshared by couple of folks this morning.  Breakfast food for thought indeed.....,btohqsg
yeahÔºå i try this for one og my car. the process is seamless,btohqsg
This is imposed by finance companies and not required for coe renewal,btohqsg
yes  my car coe renewed by sgcm  finance by toyota finance,btohqsg
the car has to transfer to them first then transfer back,btohqsg
