But you put in $7000  now become $6879?,btohqsg
Makes it more accurate  5.8% p.a. interest on $6780 yields $1.07 per day.Your total interest  assuming it's 5.8% p.a. interest daily from 10 Apr 23 till today is $299.50.Since it's from Oct  it's not $299.50:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163440,btohqsg

Where can i park the 100k for 1 month from One account and then deposit back for the Dragon saving promo?,btohqsg
Ur parking till March? Can consider sc bonussaver or perhaps Stash,btohqsg
Did you already moved your 100k previously before 30 Dec 10:30pm?,btohqsg
as long as you empty before end of Mar should be ok right?,btohqsg
i mean  in antipation of the next quarter earmark promo,btohqsg
No money still in One account,btohqsg
Then keeping it within UOB One account would be better than moving to UOB Stash account also,btohqsg
Then you can deposit 100k from elsewhere into UOB Stash to participate in the Rising Dragon promo. Keep the 100k in UOB One account to earn the 5% p.a. EIR.,btohqsg
