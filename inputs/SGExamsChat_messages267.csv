Ya but i dont know man,btohqsg
what kind of arts do u wanna pursue,btohqsg
Can i still do that i in higher ite,btohqsg
Idk properly along the line of graphic design,btohqsg
my friend in hnitec -) nafa,btohqsg
ahahah tats what I do as my part time job,btohqsg
Or illustration but they all kinda suck,btohqsg
LASALLE could be another path too,btohqsg
apparently theres a school called MAD school that offers graphic design too,btohqsg
I oni see q a bit of design ah,btohqsg
Thing is that my stuffs are not that great,btohqsg
dont look down on ur self,btohqsg
uw send u pm send ahh,btohqsg
I CAN GET AT LEst 1 MARK GOR MATH PAPER 2,btohqsg
i still rmb in sec 2 i got 49/100 so i went to desperately find a way to get that 1 mark,btohqsg
and then somehow my teacher managed to give me 1 mark i was so happy,btohqsg
lmao my brain gonez alr i not that smart to get 49/50 LOL,btohqsg
Common last topics will be dropped from the GCE exams this year. All schools in Singapore will cut the scope for the year-end exams due to Covid-19 disruptions  and to ease exam stress.https://str.sg/33tXStay in the know:str.sg,btohqsg
wah i still learning organic chem now wor,btohqsg
my chem teacher confirm fed up liao wor,btohqsg
yes we know whats gonna happen,btohqsg
iirc for last yr CLT  the distinction rate for A level H2 Chem dropped a few %,btohqsg
some of us self-learning and we one topic ahead,btohqsg
i also wish uni got CLT,btohqsg
take stats module got CLT le,btohqsg
bro take stats in uni either way also die,btohqsg
i rather score a lower % overall for another mod and still get A+,btohqsg
there's a mod 85% overall alr A+,btohqsg
just moderate the results yourself and write stats report on ur peer results,btohqsg
the prof wont trust a bottom fragger on the curve,btohqsg
bottom on curve can be right tail,btohqsg
but u getting paid comfortably right haha,btohqsg
not rly possible to have CLT for them anyways,btohqsg
no la stat boards will peg ma,btohqsg
not cs tho  cs 75th is crazy,btohqsg
Since n is sufficiently large  by Central Limit Theorem  X~N(Mean  Variance) approximately.,btohqsg
i mean is still good  for 75th for other majors in cs,btohqsg
gg time to use t with df 29,btohqsg
hello did anybody c the news on removal of clt,btohqsg
just wondering what were the topics removed last year,btohqsg
need to wait for ur teacher to announce,btohqsg
i lucky lo but anyway increments don't need to talk la,btohqsg
i lookin forward to get lowballed,btohqsg
Asking for chem math and h1 econs,btohqsg
Thats gna take some time right,btohqsg
any science grads in ur workplace?,btohqsg
tm chem  linear reg and corr  globalisation,btohqsg
need to confirm  but shld be this,btohqsg
for now we can only suspect is same as last yr,btohqsg
but globalisation is h2 econs right,btohqsg
yeahh i wna see which i can avoid studying AHAHA,btohqsg
not sure bout my workplace cause wfh -> little chance to interact but one of the perms i've worked with in prev internships in the same sector is a physics grad,btohqsg
monetary policy in macropolicy to improve standard of living,btohqsg
I'm not happy for CLT üò¢,btohqsg
actually funny thing when i did a pentesting module assisted by deloitte  the guy in charge is an econs grad,btohqsg
The last topic is my hope üò¢,btohqsg
quite normal i feel to see other majors in tech,btohqsg
Can they remove the middle topic HAHAHA,btohqsg
i hope i can be there,btohqsg
dunno whether got price discrimination because your major tho,btohqsg
but they do the same things as u?,btohqsg
yeah they're in very technical roles,btohqsg
wah nice o levels no vectors no organic chema levels no transition metals no linear regression no climate change (bio),btohqsg
my tuition teacher taught vectors for one whole month and now his efforts ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
u in jc or sec sch?,btohqsg
i see a lot of my course mates joining CSA's work-study programme  maybe can consider,btohqsg
i sent the link to my tuition teacher and he just replied with this üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
i taught transition elements to my students,btohqsg
if u go jc u still need to know vectors,btohqsg
haha i planning to go poly lol,btohqsg
i was damn happy no more transition metals (took As last year),btohqsg
Is the total marks still the same,btohqsg
but the time remains the same,btohqsg
"""Explain why complexes are coloured [3 marks]""",btohqsg
oo cool yallz all the best,btohqsg
so its nt liek they test more weightage,btohqsg
lets test lets trace lets vaccinate,btohqsg
but linear is quite easy ngl,btohqsg
you can test at home now  if u follow my linee,btohqsg
i went to do the question during my A level paper (ofc i crossed it out after that),btohqsg
If it's 5 marks for the last topic then the total mark for the paper - 5 marks,btohqsg
but honestly idt clt is good,btohqsg
I thought they will adjust the marks weightage,btohqsg
at least for a lvl chem last yr cohort didnt do so well compared to prev cohorts,btohqsg
compare linear to legit stats its godsend,btohqsg
its v beneficial for h2 bio ppl,btohqsg
cos h2 bio paper impossible finish right,btohqsg
i rmb my actual p2 i couldnt finish,btohqsg
the last chapter is in freaking 3 parts and each part is like so thick,btohqsg
if takin bio in uni its good prior knowledge ba,btohqsg
but tbf last year paper 2 only 5 marks cancelled so total marks 95,btohqsg
ppl dont do well in immunology in uni,btohqsg
at least thats what my cher said,btohqsg
I feel bad for my tuition teacher,btohqsg
he said during his time in NUS a lot of ppl do badly in immunology,btohqsg
things prob changed since immunology is taught in a lvls,btohqsg
the clt for bio is more of EVB speciailisation / evolutionary biology imo,btohqsg
^ this and its not in clt so,btohqsg
and that one month is in hbl + june hols,btohqsg
im not taking that so LOL,btohqsg
i plan to take immunology mods,btohqsg
no la i still jc equi,btohqsg
spent hols to teach something that's not tested üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
but i still know the modules ah,btohqsg
but ngl i rather study immuno than climate change,btohqsg
oh still in green i guess,btohqsg
i tot u in uni alr psps lol,btohqsg
i study organic until sot already LOL,btohqsg
make good use of ur time to prep for ur course before uni,btohqsg
esp NUS  a lot of smurfs,btohqsg
issfine  dont intend to do bio ü§©,btohqsg
reminds me of my history o lvls,btohqsg
its literally a week till uni starts :‚Äù)),btohqsg
is anyone in TP here? How's the school liketbh idk what else to ask lol,btohqsg
my class spent a lot of time prepping for essay qns that didnt came up at o lvls,btohqsg
if u got an A in H2 Bio  u should be ok,btohqsg
A100 will be the death of me,btohqsg
but bell curve in NUS for bio is super steep,btohqsg
my friend got 12/15 for a test,btohqsg
his final overall result for that bio module is A-,btohqsg
so u can see how steep it is,btohqsg
HAHAHAH i live near there so that's pretty tru,btohqsg
i went 2 times and i swore to never go,btohqsg
idk i find all the y1 modules braindead,btohqsg
go in rekt bell curve only,btohqsg
but ive only seen some la,btohqsg
altho ppl gonna kill me sayin this,btohqsg
usually LSM life sci mods hard to get A  but A- quite ok if u put in quite some effort,btohqsg
but if in JC/IB u are like the top few % in ur sch for bio  then A shldnt be a problem honestly,btohqsg
think it depends on background also,btohqsg
ik some ppl my yr w A in LSM1105 and 6 ah,btohqsg
wah they took bio in uni?,btohqsg
I be those some if Im a student,btohqsg
org chem is one of the easiest to score,btohqsg
well dont remove they also unhappy so,btohqsg
u havent see true organic chem yet,btohqsg
my batch no IB student did well in last yr organic exam,btohqsg
what does a lvl org chem do,btohqsg
but the person got around 20/50 for mid year exam  and 65-70 ish/100 for final exam,btohqsg
cos cohort averages was 37/50 for mid years  80+/100for final,btohqsg
end of year wan go hike again,btohqsg
LOL i'm gonna die from brain damage this sem sorry,btohqsg
is because of organic chem and comp sci,btohqsg
i did org 2 years ago i return to cher ale,btohqsg
i take less time to do entire a lvl bio paper than i take to do 1 org chem qn now,btohqsg
IS THE WHOLE ORG CHEM OUT???,btohqsg
eh this one looks doablewith my textbook,btohqsg
i mean is org chem ah,btohqsg
u praying on org chem to pass u?,btohqsg
cuz org chem is one of the can score section,btohqsg
yes o lvl org chem is free marks,btohqsg
bruh never thought id witness org chem being the saving grace,btohqsg
Organic chem and organic biochem easy to score,btohqsg
some say moles over org chem,btohqsg
eh i feel like this is a very dangerous thing to say,btohqsg
so u studying chem in uni?,btohqsg
Just memorise functional grps can alr,btohqsg
org biochem easy to score... fam i got some bad news for u,btohqsg
make sure when u enter uni chem i'm the setter for the final exam,btohqsg
I took it last sem ah now i doing pharm prac,btohqsg
thats if one goes on to do masters/phD,btohqsg
So like we learn how to use AAS  UV vis  Gc/ HPLC,btohqsg
Poly level still okay ah i havent see uni,btohqsg
i took a biochem mod last sem rehash of a lvl bio,btohqsg
i mean i had 10 pathways to learn in 2 weeks ah,btohqsg
SO IS THERE CLT OR NOT,btohqsg
a lvl bio got biochem meh,btohqsg
fst is the major that needs to memrorise pathways,btohqsg
I see biochem i start crying...,btohqsg
i had to memorise for sch ah,btohqsg
@jianjun22LEL my student complainin to me,btohqsg
ok tbh anyth remotely biochem / chem hurts my soul,btohqsg
tbh i also dk why i chose chem,btohqsg
is not dunno how to do... is do already pain...,btohqsg
do so much pain until cry...,btohqsg
GUYS I SPENT THE LAST 3 DAYS STUDYING EMI,btohqsg
aiya  dl the 9-5 in the future become breaking bad,btohqsg
shud be end of cold war,btohqsg
tats what Im teaching my student at least,btohqsg
finally a chem chpt i enjoyed then got removed ü§°üî´,btohqsg
i have a lovehate relationship w chem,btohqsg
eh today i find out sgexams got many psychopaths,btohqsg
like biochem  like org chem all,btohqsg
CLTMath - VectorsAdd Math - Proof in Plane GeometryPhysics - Electromagnetic InductionChemistry - Organic Chemistry,btohqsg
pls i open vsc i also pain,btohqsg
wait til full list out then I post for u on reddit,btohqsg
ok i copy paste for u,btohqsg
can i send this to peepol,btohqsg

BUT MORE OR LESS THE SAME THING,btohqsg
IP still take a lvls no?,btohqsg
where is the cut ib syll,btohqsg

i comparing o lvl prelim papers vs ip prelim papers,btohqsg
confirm is where tf the clt,btohqsg
i mean eoy then  sama sama la,btohqsg
and like our chem is much more stuff to know,btohqsg
like for example o lvl chem only learn 2  8  8  2,btohqsg
then ip got full of QA and 1s2 2p6 etc,btohqsg
simisai is 2 8 8 2,btohqsg
ngl  to me i feel abit diff only,btohqsg
cuz we start out learning 2 8 8 2,btohqsg
ya la but sometimes more is not too much extra also,btohqsg
and also express dont have QA,btohqsg
and also got other stuff i forgot,btohqsg
QA not hard ba  just tedious,btohqsg
QA got lick and sniff test can alr,btohqsg
HAVE TO MEMORISE COLOURS OF EVERYTHING,btohqsg
qa is learnt in y3 ip,btohqsg
i mean for my school at least,btohqsg
come to y4 then really good luck sia,btohqsg
no la  sec sch jc chem u lick and sniff wont die one,btohqsg
but in case u die dont say me hor,btohqsg
I took a look at qualitative analysis,btohqsg
not the most but yeah sure is,btohqsg
Seems like we have to memorise alot?,btohqsg
after a while of prac u should get it,btohqsg
Results come back then die yes,btohqsg
ooo this yr have CLT removed,btohqsg
ü§ù Here are the new mental health measures to strengthen existing measures in schools.Follow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates.,btohqsg
got the grp chat link xd,btohqsg
Why when CLT removed  ppl not happy sia,btohqsg
People say they remove easy topic,btohqsg
Some also say sch alr covered the topics,btohqsg
My prelims math paper 2 today,btohqsg
Some CLT is actually very easy.,btohqsg
Like linear regression for H1/H2 math is also very easy,btohqsg
i dunno to be happy or sad,btohqsg
i haven't finish learning organic chem,btohqsg
Organic Chem the only I understand,btohqsg
I eating ben and jerry now,btohqsg
Singapore's Joseph Schooling finishes 6th in his 100m freestyle heat. He clocked 49.84sec in the race  failing to advance to Wednesday's semi-final.https://str.sg/33vaStay in the know:str.sg,btohqsg
I guess you got say that he got some schooling,btohqsg

Why they take out the environment for bio sskksskksks,btohqsg
Wah shiok they took out food for elect geog,btohqsg
MY MAN N ENVIRONMENT FOR BIO,btohqsg
meh for geog i cant memorise,btohqsg
good job yall hv 1 gateway of that shit now,btohqsg
Coming from someone who only understand organic Chem,btohqsg
ok can understand but the memorising part is alot,btohqsg
Assuming it's like last yr  they will just cancel organic without removing the time given to complete the paper so u will have more time for each qns,btohqsg
Now i dont learn science alr,btohqsg
is this year's clt out yet,btohqsg
im really sad nuclear physics got removed lol,btohqsg
Seeing my current grades  I dont think I can do very well lmao,btohqsg
Teacher told us that's the easy one,btohqsg
Honestly idk what I'm studying haha,btohqsg
let's hope he qualifies for that,btohqsg
Idk I'm pretty sure that will be rej haha,btohqsg
hello dudes. uni start school question here:so I got a sick Lenovo 2-in-1 laptop that can transformers into a tablet. I had the intention of using it to write digital notes with the penafter writing some digital notes  I'm contemplating between the practicality between digital notes and paper notesAm I dumb?,btohqsg
Problem with digital notes is that u can scribble as fast as u want compared to paper  if u need to write a lot of info  u can squeeze into a page so its easier.,btohqsg
With ios15 u can convert physical notes into digital one,btohqsg
can buy chicken rice for lunch alrd,btohqsg
