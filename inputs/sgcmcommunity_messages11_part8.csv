Really? I must have been mixing wrong ratio. Yeah...I don't prefer 2in1.,btohqsg
i only want a good shampoo. and armor all i have used a few times is not bad. it is foamy better than others. and i like it',btohqsg
i use quite a lot. more than two cups with a bucket of water,btohqsg
you can try the sonax active foam if you looking for foamy on top of that is ph neutral  safe if you got coating,btohqsg
Haha serious   after u do coating   just use water jet or splash water and wipe off car is clean,btohqsg
Oh I see. Why not? What are the pros?,btohqsg
haha wrong la. no wonder. this is NOT good,btohqsg
I mean what are the cons..,btohqsg
"use a PROPER car shampoo and not ""mixed""",btohqsg
the car shampoo BLUE one is the good one. lots of foam and cleans well,btohqsg
I use this with the sonax shampoo for foam party,btohqsg
i have a high pressure water jet syetm kartcher,btohqsg
Got This wash car is a breeze,btohqsg
actually quite true ...except that i get a lot of water stains due to outdoor parking at my work place... so it is shinny from afar,btohqsg
yeah great for removing grime and wheels,btohqsg
Use high pressure water jet   then can wipe off liao,btohqsg
but i think i blasted too high pressure into wing mirrors and one mirror paint laquer has come off,btohqsg
The most important is the high pressure water jet to remove all dirt,btohqsg
wah you used industrial jet ah ...,btohqsg
Buy from shopppee those $100 can liao more then enoigh,btohqsg
So far my experience in washing car   easiest method is high pressure water jet   then use a big and high absorption cloth to wipe off then tada car is clean and sexy,btohqsg
i have a lot of tools,btohqsg
doing some simple repairs is quite a good feeling when you fix it. for me i aint mechanic. but i watched youtubers how to do it and so i did it. reason is my old e30 i got to do it myself. not many outside want to do it. they prefer to do newer cars. sort of feel so unloved. but the upside is yeah great satisfaction to see i repair it.,btohqsg
Speaking of water marks...how to prevent this after washing? I get water marks after drying my car....ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„,btohqsg
for me  this simple repair to fix clutch cylinders is achievement for me that delivers satisfaction. i cannot get mechanic to come to my house. and i cannot move my car there as the clutch cylinders failed. so the only way is to repair dirty my hands at home. took my 3 weeks. back breaking... lol,btohqsg
space constrained. almost impossible to access the cramped space,btohqsg
i got it too. i dont know how to fix this,btohqsg
if it is not dried after a rain (espcially if it is baking out in the sun) you will get water stain so i send it for polishing probably once a year,btohqsg
Need to use buffering machine to remove. After that go do ceramic coating lo. And Regular maintenance and washing. Can prevent,btohqsg
Or can choose to dechrome the silver areas,btohqsg
Problem is I get it after I dried my car after a wash....ðŸ™„....,btohqsg
Very smart move for reducing areas to look after =D Very common on chrome areas,btohqsg
For Chrome areas u can try to use Clay Mitten or Claybar to remove. Haven tried but may work. Haha,btohqsg
Microfiber cloth. Good absorbing power but needs wringing after a while...hahaha...water marks are on the boot cover n hood...ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ðŸ™„,btohqsg
best solution ...dont look at it ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
I look at it daily. Just shake my head and walk away...ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Looking forward to strip to bare metal  repaint and sent to detailing store immediately for professional paint protection. Then I will just do my own paint maintenance and reapply coating,btohqsg
Salute to the dedication u had =D ðŸ¤š,btohqsg
No la  my car old. Can strip to bare metal. Also due to for body restoration.,btohqsg
I just notice new civic is in cat a and look so cute,btohqsg
Ah i see good to know =D Nice,btohqsg
How much is this set torque wrench? Iâ€™m think to buy one,btohqsg
Snap on torque wrench price is not charming,btohqsg
This one is German brand wera. I bought it on Amazon Germany. Free shipping. 197 euro. Click torque set 2,btohqsg
Check it out. I asked my German friend and he recommends this. But there are other German brands too. Good ones.,btohqsg
LoL such guy needs such girl to spur him to one day earn 35k and make the girl bang wall ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Maybe canâ€™t wash clean his old VW?,btohqsg
What can I use to remove water stains?,btohqsg
Good value. And good quality. I think some shops sell this in singapore. But you can buy direct from Amazon Germany,btohqsg
Either send it to your detailer or get your own buffer polisher to do the job on your own,btohqsg
