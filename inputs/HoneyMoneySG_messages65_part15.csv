As long as u didn't tap your card or your card in your phone it is NOT contactless,btohqsg
The description of Apple Pay being contactless is somewhat ambiguous alsoSome restaurants like TamJai Samgor is order via QR code and can pay thru Apple Pay.It‚Äôs actually quite ambiguous sometimes and I think the UOB chat cso also sometimes not sure,btohqsg
How do you use ApplePay to scan QR code (not via third party apps)?,btohqsg
You don't order via QR code. You scan the QR code to their website to order and make payment ONLINE on their website.,btohqsg
Oh okay that sounds legit too hope it turns out to be online,btohqsg
it will be online  as contactless need to go through pos terminal,btohqsg
Simple  if you hear BEEP then it is contactless  No beep not contactless,btohqsg

It's not ambiguous. Here i give you the definition from UOB TnC..Contactless TransactionsYou will earn UNI$10 per S$5 spend on Contactless Transactions (excluding atUOB$ merchants) successfully carried out on and charged to the Card.‚ÄúContactless Transactions‚Äù refers collectively to: (i) Card Transactions that areperformed using the Card via Visa payWave; and (ii) Card Transactions made via ApplePay  Fitbit Pay  Google Pay  Samsung Pay  Android Pay and UOB Mighty (or suchother mobile payment services as UOB may from time to time approve at its solediscretion)  that is effected at any Visa payWave Readers  either by tapping or waving theCard or mobile device against the Visa payWave Readers. For the avoidance of doubt Contactless Transactions exclude Magnetic Secure Transmission transactions  SPCtransactions  UOB$ participating merchants and SimplyGo (ABT) Transactions.(This is from UOB Visa Signature  but the definition should be the same)Terms and Conditions Governing UOB Visa Signature Cardhttps://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/cards/credit-cards/travel-cards/uob-visa-signature-card/terms-and-conditions-governing-uob-visa-signature-card.pdf,btohqsg
Apps you use don't matter. The methods do. You tap and beep against a reader  that's contactless,btohqsg

Anyone knows if dbs woman world works earns miles when used with atome?From my research atome is 5999. Wwmc doesnt exclude that,btohqsg
I‚Äôm curious  why need to trigger manually?Cannot just let it auto try get the payment? In this case then won‚Äôt count as online?,btohqsg
"Ok la actually people have said that not manual might also be ok. But I'd rather trigger manually to trigger an ""online purchase"" as opposed to recurring",btohqsg
Then ur statement might not stand already,btohqsg
Simi not stand. That one is about contactless vs online,btohqsg
If need to trigger then consider online then perhaps it‚Äôs not so all encompassing?Putting aside recurring / non recurringBecause regardless it‚Äôs still paid in-app with no contact to the POS,btohqsg
2 different things.People were asking if apple pay/google pay/samsung pay considered online or contactless.On this matter - the apps don't matter. You need to tap against a terminal to be considered contactless.This atome thing is different. It's considered online through an online gateway.No relation at all to contactless vs online question.,btohqsg
Really arh?As long as I pay w Atome  even though link with Apple Pay  it‚Äôs also online?,btohqsg
Yes considered online.Because *contactless* is when you *tap* against a terminal.See my point - it's not the app. It's the method.,btohqsg
Anybody got $3 PayLah! promo after 935am today?,btohqsg
