Hi gurus  I have setup giro to pay my uob one cc via hsbc EGA. If I apply another uob cc. Do i need to apply the giro again for the new cc?,btohqsg
Oops just saw that theres more replies after this message. thank you!!!hey Melvyn! thanks for your reply. i just did it up:is my calculation correct? at least for the amount needed in septfrom what im seeing if we want to hit the Save category... if your balance rises  you're required to add more and more money in. of course the higher the balance the higher the interest (diff. tiers),btohqsg
where is good to park emergency fund ah?,btohqsg
To enjoy the additional interest from investing  one need to invest minimum 20k into the unit trust. Do I have to invest 20k at one go or can spread out in 12 mths?,btohqsg
Hi  can I check how would be the points earned for UOB Lady's Card (non-solitary) if I booked an air ticket for $1 000 in July and was awarded 200 UNI$. Subsequently  the ticket was cancelled due to a flight change  and the money was refunded to the same card in September. Will the 200 UNI$ I earned be removed in September?Additionally  if I spend $2 000 instead of $1 000 in September  will I get to retain the earned 200 UNI$ and still earn UNI$ for the additional $1 000?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 is pretty good i think,btohqsg
Some questions. About how much (below or above 75k mark)  any salary credit  any credit card spend?,btohqsg
Is citipremiere miles worth the miles spent locally? I am using crmc+amaze but sometimes I will exceed the 1k cap. Not every month but only sometimes,btohqsg
How often do you exceed? I personally I'd get another 4mpd card.,btohqsg
Used Amaze to txf $ to msia acct b4. The fx rate n fee is displayed before confirming the transaction. So can use it to compare with alternatives. If got amaze points or promo to offset  fees  it may‚Ä¶ be worth it. Can consider top up to tng using yt and then using tng to txf to biz.Bank txf=giro  duitnow=paynow/fast. Closest mapping i can think of.,btohqsg
Hihi  May I know what is best cash back card now  with No Min amt spend? I have Simply card from SC which I think is 1.5%...but just thinking any better ones.I understand fnf is 8%  but is restricted to the 5 categories.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  can I check if I were to use Amaze card that is paired with apple pay for offline purchases do I still get the bonus rewards from Citi rewards card? As far as I know for Citi rewards card you are not entitled to bonus rewards if paired with apple pay.,btohqsg
Can I ask  for insurance I have the Maybank platinum   which is widely discussed here. But does it qualify if I use AXS for payment for Great eastern policies - unlike AIA and Prudential I don‚Äôt think they have the online option to payThanks in advanced,btohqsg
GE app allows u to pay premium using cc,btohqsg
Hi gurus  can i ask if there's any credit cards out there with benefits for payment of digital ads like fb/ig?,btohqsg
Yes your calculations are correct. You should include $1318 daily from today onwards.,btohqsg
Not all policies can be paid using cc for GE,btohqsg
Thanks! Well noted and great info. Hadn‚Äôt been paying using their app. My insurance are 40k a year. Easily can meet their Maybank tiering.But if I go through AXS does it count for spend for the Maybank platinum cashback rebates? I just activated my card,btohqsg
Yes well noted on this too.Older policies I believe can‚Äôt be done,btohqsg
Yes. But worth a try first,btohqsg
I think crmc and other general spends cards can earn miles. Can you check mcc for those transactions?,btohqsg
No. Must direct. Else can use CardUp.,btohqsg
Maybe restricted based on type  not age. I‚Äôm servicing one from 20yrs ago,btohqsg
are there any better ways to check the mcc other than using instarem amaze?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm talking about those ineligible are those my parents bought for me when I was a kid- pay for life kind. I‚Äôm in my 40+ üòÇSo I think 30+ years or more policies,btohqsg
Depends on both. Certain type can pay with cc even if older. But certain type can only pay if commenced after a certain date. And certain type cannot pay with cc.,btohqsg
Doblin app can check account code,btohqsg
Better in what way? It's one of the more reliable ones.,btohqsg
I think DBS locked card and digibot works still.,btohqsg
thought someone tested not working already?,btohqsg
I was reading somewhere it stopped working for dbs digibot,btohqsg
Hey Melvyn sorry I‚Äôd like to confirmDo you mean MAB for Sep should be 1318? Or based on my calculations  I just need to top up 399.xx today to qualify for the Save category for the month of Sep?,btohqsg
i think Chris said in his video yesterday,btohqsg
yes. assuming your transaction mcc are not in the exclusions of crmc,btohqsg
Maybe I'm wrong haha. I tot not working but I searched still got ppl checking back in Jul.,btohqsg
No. Your balance should be at least $1318. From today till 30 Sep.,btohqsg
Does mcc 8021 fall under evol exclusion? Dental clinic mcc should be included right as part of min. spend,btohqsg
might be quite often for the rest of 2024.uob has to select a category which i may not qualify for 4mpd that‚Äôs why its kinda hard to go uob lady,btohqsg
Sep some ppl confirm with dbs not working already,btohqsg
Lemme quickly go test dbs digibot haha,btohqsg
Check ur own spending to see which cat you spent the most on. For my case  putting all dining expenses on UOB lady offload 6-800 on crmc.,btohqsg
below 75k mark  no salary credit but if can paynow in idm and no credit card spend,btohqsg
Thanks for your advice. I found wise was the cheapest but there appears to be a 10 000 ringgit daily transfer limit to the target account so I had to break up my transfers.,btohqsg
