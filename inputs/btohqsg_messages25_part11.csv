SBF occurs once a year in February.The list of flats come from unsold units in the BTO exercise as well as drop outs from people who have selected the BTO or forfeiture.While the timeline from BTO to SBF launch is not disclosed  mine was roughly 2 years from BTO to SBF.,btohqsg
Not instantaneously from leftover after flat booking?,btohqsg
Nope not instantaneously listed. Seems like they will group and pool a large number before releasing to SBF.,btohqsg
But eg  yours' was 2yrs from bto? This is long.Thought hdb gather Feb  Jun's bto to have SBF in Feb of the year.,btohqsg
Ya mine was 2 years and mine is a single stack.,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think HDB will push out flats to SBF until all BTO queue holders have selected or dropped.. which usually only starts selection a few months after BTO results out. So 1.5-2 years sounds reasonable,btohqsg
First part yes  second part not necessarily as they can just push those few flats to the next SBF launchAnyways SBF is a much tougher fight than BTO,btohqsg
Yeah.. high demand low supply. Especially for people who donâ€™t want to wait 3-5 years for their flats will want to fight for SBF,btohqsg
Hi is there any email/hotline which I can reach out to contact them?,btohqsg
HDB number is 1800-866-3066Follow the IVRhttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/HDBContent/Images/SCEG/eapg-ivr.ashxalternatively you can submit an e-feedback found on their website,btohqsg
Apparently I tried calling them and they mentioned that the HFE/housing loan will not be reassessed after I told them my case,btohqsg
write in again and reword your justification. if all else fails  ask your MP to help ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
need to redo hfe if its expiring next month but got number for june bto? if want to apply oct bto and reapply for hfe will it affect the june bto application?,btohqsg
Nope for HFE letter however June BTO is based on your existing HFE. Maybe you want to elaborate whether if you are within supply for June 2024?,btohqsg
If you have already used the HFE letter to apply for a flat in our earlier sales exercises  these flat applications will not be affected.,btohqsg
Can we change from hdb loan to bank loan after signing the lease agreement?,btohqsg
so can just reapply again la? out of supply but got number given. if no number i wouldnt bother just reapply liao. but in order to reapply need to cancel the old one?,btohqsg
Hello! I have a question :) If we applied for HFE letter for BTO (iirc  there's a field where you've to state what this letter is for: BTO/Resale?)...Can we use the same letter for resale application or do we have to get a new letter? Thank you.,btohqsg
Thank you for the clarification :),btohqsg
Hi may I know if I get the Q number and wait for November to select the unit  does it affect the loan amount if i change a new car now?,btohqsg
U Change new car got affect loan one meh,btohqsg
U got ur HFE already  so should not affect...,btohqsg
How  come Canberra   Vista blk376C  next years  February  ready  collection  key?,btohqsg
What keyboard can lets you auto double spacing? Thanks sharing.,btohqsg
HDB loans are subjected to MSR  not TDSR I suppose.If he/she is taking a housing loan from a financial institution  then yes  TDSR will be considered.,btohqsg
Actually Iâ€™m curious  whatâ€™s the average dropout rate for bto ? 20%-30%?,btohqsg
Tanglin halt courtyard dropout rate is quite high,btohqsg
So many reason why ppl dropout.,btohqsg
Unless u interview everyone get their answer,btohqsg
I thought many have prepared before applying for this bto,btohqsg
There are people who still missed out certain steps.,btohqsg
May I know what is the drop out rate for Tanglin Halt courtyard?,btohqsg
Is it possible hdb officer will suggest people to dropout if financial capabilities is insufficient? Like too high over the budget? Or will they accept regardless?,btohqsg
My friend dropout before cannot Use HDB loan  not enough CPF. During selection  HDB officer tells them to use bank loan  they can't afford to loan and reject the selection. Dropout,btohqsg
So far around 20 out of 111 (111 is last queue for today)..,btohqsg
Why cannot use hdb loan? Cos use up 2x chances?,btohqsg
I guess they wont suggest but just inform about the amount of cash topup,btohqsg
Maybe ur friend think if cant pay downpayment later better to dropout early on coz later waste money if cant afford?,btohqsg
I am speculating holland V dropout might be higher than tanglin halt given the higher prices,btohqsg
Salary Not enough to justify to loan from HDB. So hdb suggest go for bank loan see how much bank can loan then reminding pay cash . They also cannot afford. No choice dropout.Financial Difficulties still die die go for 4rm unit. Aiya what to do never listen never go plan,btohqsg
Did they know this beforehand during their hfe ?,btohqsg
Are they fresh grads ? Or self employed?,btohqsg
For those non mature estates drop out rates lower ?,btohqsg
Some people are very young to plan carefully. Die2 they think bigger rooms and central location is best,btohqsg
Like 21 years old after ns/study but then they go buy 5 room at queentowns. Then pick highest floor,btohqsg
Cpf and loan for sure not enough. Best to be prudence,btohqsg
Maybe.. not sure.. what u applied?,btohqsg
Queue within or out of supply? Chencharu is quite affordable and popular amongst the non matured estates,btohqsg
Itâ€™s within supply   I applied 4 rm flat itâ€™s within my budget range ;),btohqsg
Chencharu is a bargain. Starts at 279k for 4 room. I think this is similar to 2020 pricing,btohqsg
