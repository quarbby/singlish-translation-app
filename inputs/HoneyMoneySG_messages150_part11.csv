it might be tough to sell within HSBC platform (fee/platform)..better find out more b4 moving in(not investment advice),btohqsg
Good point... I didn't give too much thoughts to it cos I don't intend to sell mine! (dbs & ocbc) üòù worse come to worst  can always transfer out to cdp at a flat fee per counter. My DBST RM helped to waive the fee  not sure about other banks... Anyway if really transferring in  only choose those counters with heavy weightage (eg. 1 counter 100k rather than 10 counters 10k each).,btohqsg
always make it a point to check EXIT STRATEGYif one day want to transfer out... HOW MUCH IT COSTS.. CAN OR NOT,btohqsg
