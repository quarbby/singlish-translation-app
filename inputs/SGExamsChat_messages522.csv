hehe boi let me go into the chemistry lab and sneak some hydrochloric acid and pour it on someone's brain!,btohqsg
Half the things you expect would safe you don‚Äôt work,btohqsg
there used to be a bar within my faculty building,btohqsg
then some drunk ass pulled the emergency shower in the middle of the night,btohqsg
Bruh some guy went in there before eoy practical and swapped out a acid solution for water,btohqsg
Luckily my friend was smart enough to realise he got water and not acid,btohqsg
I only ever had idiots trigger the emergency eye wash :/,btohqsg
Looks like a sink with 2 holes u put your eye there for 5 mins If exposed to chemicals,btohqsg
bro i remember during combined biology practical class i accidentally turned on the bunsen burner with the test tube having ethanol inside üíÄ,btohqsg
I rmb back in my school  the locks of doors were never working,btohqsg
So when everyone was waiting for ‚ÄúCCA‚Äù‚Ä¶ppl be chilling in the presumably ‚Äúlocked‚Äù classrooms,btohqsg
and then there's someone chilling in the science labs,btohqsg
or if the d&t workshop doors werent locked then maybe in that place too,btohqsg
Yea  cause they don‚Äôt want students to do hanky panky,btohqsg
That is the most common occurrence for a empty classroom,btohqsg
Chairs and tables can be used to cause damage injured someone,btohqsg
yes like throwing it on someone,btohqsg
It's mainly cuz no supervision and 16 year old don't go well,btohqsg
Because the windows of classrooms are tall af,btohqsg
And the only visuals of most classrooms are only through a small open window,btohqsg
my sec sch classroom windows were like really tall lol,btohqsg
A lot of shit can be hidden and done in classrooms,btohqsg
especially in my schools computer labs,btohqsg
Once wanted to go to an empty classroom to study went into one and saw 2 students doing some heavy petting and just noped out,btohqsg
Bruh even my school Did not allow a teacher to stay in. The classroom to mark papers,btohqsg
In poly the youngest is 16 what that's why,btohqsg
I saw with my own eyes the ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù walked in and told the teacher to leave,btohqsg
yep if you haven't passed 17 birthday yet,btohqsg
Oh yea you know rp‚Äôs got those corner seats right?,btohqsg
At the end of the corridors,btohqsg
did someone do weird weird shit again,btohqsg
I used to have lunch there,btohqsg
Last yr a couple was caught there,btohqsg
But I also saw some shit there before,btohqsg
like pda as in just kiss or legit do that shit,btohqsg
‚ÄúLegit‚Äù from what I heard then everybody rushed out from the classes on the level to see,btohqsg
There's a 5-6pm curfew when the cleaners start chasing ppl out of the classrooms,btohqsg
They were caught by the ‚Äúblack shirts‚Äù,btohqsg
were they like actually showing that part or no,btohqsg
They were doing the deed from what I heard,btohqsg
honestly why do beside water cooler if you can do it at home bruhor do it in the rp lecture halls la nobody even used that,btohqsg
Amateur.. lemme give them a hint the handicap toliet is always empty,btohqsg
Nah nowadays later open see vapers,btohqsg
It's after u finish one leave,btohqsg
Then 5 mins later the other leave,btohqsg
i went to sports complex handicapped toilet before,btohqsg
that was because there wasonlya handicapped toilet,btohqsg
Nah I know  but the ones I‚Äôve seen always got a bodyguard,btohqsg
Outside the handicap toilet so most likely not doing the deed inside,btohqsg
No it's the DO they usually check those areas,btohqsg
like the whole of the day?,btohqsg
Bro bout think rp is a prison,btohqsg
i mean you said there's a prison beside rp so,btohqsg
U go into RP north entrance at 9am u would think so too,btohqsg
2 blackshirts staff there judging everyone's outfit,btohqsg
Takes 3 weeks to go into effect,btohqsg
Rp‚Äôs admin side is slow af,btohqsg
You sign anything  fill anything ask anything important‚Ä¶will take like a week to resolve,btohqsg
Like you physically can't it's a tg moe thing,btohqsg
Until now they still doing my bursary,btohqsg
It will be so until MSA ends,btohqsg

Biomed.. u ask me so much u last time N now what sia,btohqsg
Idk I got confused probably was belinda that's N,btohqsg
So we got slow rp and slow govt,btohqsg
is every poly as slow as rp,btohqsg
in terms of these kinda stuff,btohqsg
RP very fast when they ask for money,btohqsg
Recently they sent me a 1.5K bill,btohqsg
I told them to fuck off,btohqsg
they are an expert at stealing from us,btohqsg
exactly then deduct very fast also,btohqsg
Ooo good luck you year what?,btohqsg
can confirm this is my personality,btohqsg
Haven't spoken to Jack since 2020,btohqsg
aiya the whole country slow la,btohqsg
Idk I think I saw him in rp‚Äôs chat,btohqsg
He's saved as Jack the Beanstalk in my contacts :),btohqsg
I left that chat in Y1,btohqsg
Yea you see this year how slow‚Ä¶the ndp shit slow af this year,btohqsg

Bruh I have a relative in Malaysia  told me a great story,btohqsg
I still waiting on NUS to reply me.. that's how radio silent it is,btohqsg
bruh i thought what countries they comparing to,btohqsg
Apply for some government subsidy  uncle got referred to 4 diff towns and 5 major cities in Malaysia within 1 yr,btohqsg
Something something got many applications gotta something something sorry more time,btohqsg
He went to every single one of the towns only to be told to go to another town,btohqsg
Sounds about right for boleh land,btohqsg
I ask him  so you explored Malaysia lah basically,btohqsg
Uncle went from Klang in johor to ipoh,btohqsg
Usually its the same admins idk I don't follow the news liao,btohqsg
So got alot of free time but legit sia,btohqsg
Previously for Singapore if yall ever do exams u will know about the SEAB MOE football,btohqsg
You ask MOE they direct you to SEAB... SEAB no hotline so u send email 3 days later they tell u its MOE case so your email cced to MOE,btohqsg
OH YEAH I HAD THAT EXPERIENCE,btohqsg
The 2 more days later MOE say there's something u need to fill out,btohqsg
Fill out that form them MOE say u submit to SEAB,btohqsg
i asked moe on the phone about certain school stuff they say they dk anything must ask seab,btohqsg
yeah but there's rawr and whothis insideand they are so toxic and weird,btohqsg
from their activities in other poly and ite chats,btohqsg
Na bro I am now interning for a medical insurance company,btohqsg
My friend send me a 18/20 answer and I saw a error and change it and now it‚Äôs 19/20,btohqsg
Back then IZONE was still alive,btohqsg
Idk but that's around your Os attempt too what,btohqsg
If you went kidzania you are old,btohqsg
I felt kidzania was so lame ngl,btohqsg
the last i went there was at 13 years old,btohqsg
Nice hope you found some helpful friends there,btohqsg
Wanna hear my insurance ver?Guy gets cancerHe's in Sri Lanka so the treatment is not available thereEnds up needing to fly to the UK for treatmentThis insurance cap per visit to 6k per outpatient visitEach visit 2k out of pocket plus he needs to travel there,btohqsg
That was why I created it in the first place  I wanted a place where y‚Äôall can share and help each other,btohqsg
Limpeh know of the story cuz I process his bills to send to insurance,btohqsg
imagine if he went to america,btohqsg
say goodbye to his net worth,btohqsg
Nah imagine he went to the Middle East,btohqsg
Had to do an airlift there for one patient too it was like 20k?,btohqsg
yeah man ryan created a chat and banned himself from itgenius,btohqsg
Abuden insurance said his max deductible was 15k,btohqsg
Im delighted to even be called useful lol,btohqsg
Abuden and it was to a us hospital btw,btohqsg
The total bill for surgery I didn't see but I knew it was 200k plus,btohqsg
i would just die lah sia,btohqsg
I wasn't in charge of entering that bill cuz it is way above my pay grade liao that one my manager do,btohqsg
If its single room and that's just the Daily rate,btohqsg
One private next to one public  that is some top notch spotlight stealing,btohqsg
the name sounds damn fancy yknow alr,btohqsg
Haven't include the investigations and tests usually that's the bulk of the cost,btohqsg
Oh shit my mother gave birth to me at gleaneagles,btohqsg
For example the cancer patient the reason why each bill in like 8k is cuz one dose of his medication is at 3.6k pounds,btohqsg
Out of all the hospitals in Singapore  there is only two hospitals I have yet to visit,btohqsg
If I was not born in Gleneagles  I would prob have not visited it as well,btohqsg
wth ryan was born in the ancient times,btohqsg
When u say immunotherapy or some form of gene therapy,btohqsg
Dollar sign is in the insurance eyes liao,btohqsg
Gleaneagles always make it to the news,btohqsg
Gleneagles at that time had a O&G package that's why,btohqsg
why is it that ive never heard of it,btohqsg
That time the stupid taxi driver lost control hit another taxi and car,btohqsg
Like it's a 1 time payment cover all kinda thing back then for Gleneages,btohqsg
is there a pic of it,btohqsg
Then that orange bmw driven by a doctor that can‚Äôt park properly also gleaneagles,btohqsg
bruh i thought you typed btw,btohqsg
The day bedok gets 1 star is the day singapore falls to Malaysian occupation,btohqsg
To be fair both of them should be fine cuz the hospital is right there,btohqsg
i feel like ryan has a gallery of buses/cars/taxis being crashed and burned,btohqsg
it can be made into a museum at this point,btohqsg
bro that word vigilante reminded me of a woman at tuas link or something who tried to block a car with her body LOL,btohqsg
That car older than me sia,btohqsg
Ah yes didn‚Äôt I said I had a while album of bus accidents,btohqsg
Most of those accidents I pull out from memory,btohqsg
I assume you have a journal of all the accidents too so do u also have a selfie of yourself on your phone too?,btohqsg
you could major in buses in university,btohqsg
who tf is banging the wall so loudlyis it my on top neighbor,btohqsg
I usually delete pics I took of myself,btohqsg
I cringe harder whenever I hear my own voice,btohqsg
as long as something about me is featured,btohqsg
I have this habit.. so my neighbours have a dog and whenever I go back home to footsteps trigger him to start barking,btohqsg
So I just bark back even louder and for 15 seconds I engaging the dog in a barking contest,btohqsg
My fascination is usually for obscure singaporean vehicles,btohqsg
More than anything else  so I know a lot of very intresting vehicles used in Singapore either by civilians or govt,btohqsg
I just have a collection of weird ass videos on my phone,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs see if you can guess what this truck does,btohqsg
it's about to hit the white truck,btohqsg
if win:>>>Print(‚Äúyou are a certified dog‚Äù)else:>>>Print(‚Äúgo home‚Äù),btohqsg
yeah im not even a dude but that looks so painful mf,btohqsg
Jokes on you I just kidnap the dog instead,btohqsg
Hey bedok why are you captured in there?,btohqsg
also ryan I just remembered you mentioned about a bubble tea stall that's closing soon or somethingwhere is it at@Ryannnnnnnnnn,btohqsg
We go there $1 mrt liao,btohqsg
If a fire boat can‚Äôt take out a fire  this is what the SCDF does,btohqsg
Nabei now I know why I was angry with you liao even back then u got a obsession with deleting your msgs,btohqsg
They bring their trucks onto barges and sail them to the island itself to fight fire,btohqsg
Send them to the other world,btohqsg
He just deletes his conversation like every 5 mins one idk why he does it too,btohqsg
You will likely never see scdf do this again,btohqsg
If the Beanstalk story was with you as Jack you would have already deleted the Beanstalk instead,btohqsg
The amount of resources needed is major,btohqsg
i use google maps and go there,btohqsg
I sometimes wanna check what I reply to guess what I cant,btohqsg
i only delete dms from weirdos and scammers,btohqsg
No i only delete when needed,btohqsg
Jack the mf deletes dms compulsively one I would have a dm with him one day the next day the entire chat is wiped,btohqsg
oh i did away with conversation deletions,btohqsg
yesthat's what I did one time with a pedophile,btohqsg
This bubble tea shop in Eunos is Doraemon-themed and sells drinks from only $2 a cup with free pearlshttps://confirmgood.com/post/doraemon-themed-bubble-tea-eunos/,btohqsg
only certain messages that i want to take back,btohqsg
who asked me for my private picsi immediately screen recorded everything and then deleted the chat,btohqsg
The SCDf likely is the organisation in sg with the most vehicles just as you thought you seen it all and you see this jungle cruiser,btohqsg
wait how tf do they delete other people's messages,btohqsg
how is that even a thing,btohqsg
On tele u can do that if its a dm,btohqsg
Its still a thing and why ppl use tele lol,btohqsg
Why is that a thing wtf,btohqsg
Cuz telegram is build on that privacy shit,btohqsg
i think that's why people were saying on reddit that its better to create group chats for project work on whatsapp  that way you can save the evidence easily,btohqsg
Yeah this mf would when the entire group using WhatsApp randomly dm on tele,btohqsg
I found the weirdest fire truck in Singapore  let‚Äôs see if anyone can guess what the purpose of this truck is,btohqsg
tele works quite differently between platforms,btohqsg
oh damn my parents wont buy me an iphone honestly,btohqsg
uhh ok idk if it‚Äôs my friends phone specifically (it might be),btohqsg
Why do have a compulsive urge to put my parts in that,btohqsg
but like for secret chats  when i delete i can only delete it for both of us but for them they can delete it for js themselves or both of us,btohqsg
looking at the big thing on top it's definitely to spray water onto civilians like what the french fire fighters are doing to the french protestors right now,btohqsg
US be like:Ever tried tear gas?,btohqsg
you can delete other people's chats too,btohqsg
You know u don't really need to use rubber bullets,btohqsg
that's not a thing in whatsapp right,btohqsg
whatsapp chat is locked to your device,btohqsg
WhatsApp only can delete your msgs,btohqsg
And that's a new feature last time cannot one,btohqsg
next time right if yall have group/team work with teammatesmake sure to create the group chat on whatsappso you wont have to be afraid of the evidence getting deleted by other people,btohqsg
Imagine you call scdf and this is the fire truck that turns up,btohqsg
The truck looks like a toy,btohqsg
Na I too paranoid to give them my number,btohqsg
so let's say if you want to report your teammates slackingyou have the chat evidence but sometimes they can delete on tele and all,btohqsg
Nope it‚Äôs a human ventilation truck,btohqsg
wont have this sort of thing ever again for me so i guess,btohqsg
well it happened to me for a modulei wanted to report to my lecturer about my teammates not doing work and i scrolled through my messages in the tele gc,btohqsg
then i realized they might have deleted it,btohqsg
tbh if i collab for a research paper i might just remember to use whatsapp in case of authorship disputes,btohqsg
but we usually use email anyway so,btohqsg
I would take a guess and you don‚Äôt know what is a human ventilation truck,btohqsg
It's usually the 17 year old lol,btohqsg
It grinds the air and create oxygen for humans,btohqsg
no bro i had a teammate who's 22 years old she went to nitec and higher nitec,btohqsg
That is the purpose of the truck,btohqsg
and took 1 year gap or some shit,btohqsg
why is that even a feature on tele,btohqsg
Bruh I got old teammate 22 yrs old finish N‚Äôs alr and flung his poly years,btohqsg
is that why the people on reddit were saying to create gcs on whatsapp specifically,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt believe you actually believe that,btohqsg
so that can collect all the evidence,btohqsg
Haha  it was a joke lol,btohqsg
yep will do that next time,btohqsg
and the fact that your phone number cannot hide also,btohqsg
i got like 23 nitec higher ns,btohqsg
No but the truck was a truck used for ventilation  the barrel you see was fan or sorts,btohqsg
i encountered a pedo from rpi reported to my mentor but he said that since he does not have his phone number he cant do anything about iton tele can hide phone no too,btohqsg
next time will just tell them to create on whatsapp lor,btohqsg
the dev actually explained why he did it,btohqsg
then if they say why i say got encrypted,btohqsg
Then you got ppl getting WhatsApp messages asking if they are the person‚Äôs telegram name,btohqsg
So I can see why they removed it,btohqsg
can i js dm you it,btohqsg
ig for the rest if they‚Äôre interested,btohqsg
Those where the old days remember 3 of us in Hnitec,btohqsg
he finished n levels at 22?,btohqsg
No rlly la but it is possible to just enter poly at 22,btohqsg
no n level  nitec  higher nitec  nyp..dropout  ns and join my batch,btohqsg
NT to Nitec then NS then Hnitec then poly,btohqsg
Had 1-2 I kept in touch with,btohqsg
my teammate is o level nitec higher nitec gap year then come rp year 1,btohqsg
there was a 28yr old y3 in my poly,btohqsg
bro got smoked for being a pedo,btohqsg
then she like damn proud of slacking one ugh,btohqsg
Took a few gap years lor but then again boys got the disadvantage of ns,btohqsg
I got a y1 student 27,btohqsg
even tried to submit hw on 12am then claim that the website down,btohqsg
its more of just happy than proud,btohqsg
because ITE dont even allow the kind of freedom RP has,btohqsg
If its 12am I'll just send via teams or email,btohqsg
yeah sia she legit said she clicked submit for rj on 2359 then kena say over alreadythen guess whatshe blamed the fucking lecturer,btohqsg
Say something stupid like my Internet down or smth,btohqsg
Rp legit in terms of education restrictions/boundaries is one of the most chillax poly's,btohqsg
say it's the lecturers fault she didnt submit work on time,btohqsg
likely its a attitude she brought over from ite,btohqsg
but her words will fall on deaf years,btohqsg
cause unlike ITE...the lecturers in poly dont really care,btohqsg
wah lian my english is so bad siano wonder C6 üò≠,btohqsg
see that's what I'm saying dude,btohqsg
especially RP  cause most are part timers,btohqsg
ITE is more controlled like legit but then again the rules violation of ITE is more severe and they usually punish more less strictly for ITE,btohqsg
most rp lecturers got a 2nd job,btohqsg
Most RP lecturers are part time.. in fact most lecturers in general are part time,btohqsg
U see the associate beside their name it means part time liao,btohqsg
marking...etc mostly done by online system,btohqsg
wonder what he's doing nowprobably being a pedo on other apps,btohqsg
they dont mark anything individually...test or exams,btohqsg
The team and inv assignments they do,btohqsg
It's only the LEO quiz cluster quiz then no,btohqsg
is every poly lecturer like rp lecturers,btohqsg
i mean..yea but they mark it when they better off letting some ai mark,btohqsg
Like if u do it in leo then its the system that marks it,btohqsg
cause their remarks legit copy and paste,btohqsg
i hate rp for many good reasons,btohqsg
i was in rp goddamn you dont know how awful it is,btohqsg
Most RJs in SAS are actually non content based so they don't rlly have weightage,btohqsg
at first it was fine but they legit start showing their true color already,btohqsg
I once drew ASCII art for my RJ got level 4 for that component,btohqsg
"yea keep asking ""so what is the hardest component""",btohqsg
"or ""What do you plan to do differently""",btohqsg
then the lecturers dgaf alsocomplained to my program chair and mentor evenall don't care one,btohqsg
If anyone was asking it was pepe the frog looking disappointed,btohqsg
Bruh our life skills teachers talk like their mouth dont need water,btohqsg
EXACTLY MY DAMN LIFE SKILLS 2 LECTURER ENGAGE AND TEACH BETTER,btohqsg
Life skills...social studies suddenly can talk about mao zedong and hitler,btohqsg
bro my lecturer said hitler is a good leader,btohqsg

My time lifeskills is asynchronous package,btohqsg

the bhuddist ferderation only has one sec school,btohqsg
If you can find her just set a date and time and I'll try to make it XD,btohqsg
probably some russian who planned it,btohqsg
and both their primary schools  maha bodhi and mee toh are renowned,btohqsg
so it comes a surprise why tf their sec school is like a shitshow,btohqsg
bro the mee toh school logo is the fucking nazi logo but opposite,btohqsg
my school logo is a penis,btohqsg

Ooo I not close with anyone from the group liao I keep in touch with bel once in a while but that's about it,btohqsg

Ok the history behind that name is actually a nice story.. can I tell it?,btohqsg
Yes.. OK so back in the Russo Finish War there was this soviet minister called Vyacheslav Molotov side note he is also the diplomat that signed the treaty with Ribbentrov for the invasion of poland,btohqsg
Anyways so this diplomat says that they would parachute bread baskets to finish citizens,btohqsg
