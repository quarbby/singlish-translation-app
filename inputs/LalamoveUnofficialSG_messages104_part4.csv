Once gave an address to send to.....but reach there....wrong....call cs and dispute with customer...fail big time....have to detour and send.....waste petrol and waste time,btohqsg
I Kanna last Sunday  send to IMH. I think I am the one gone crazy.,btohqsg
Not banning anyone businesses or any other agenda....but awareness for all to open their eyes to see such üëΩ exist,btohqsg
1. 1 big detour just to answer questions and get sticker to enter imh,btohqsg
2. Wrong building... Int he end need to find the building using your eyes and self navigate,btohqsg
3. The building under renovation  there is no visible place to enter except to go via staircase. To Level 7,btohqsg
4. Ok only to realised that the door access from that staircase was locked..,btohqsg
5. The person said can come in from the staircase  only to realised he merely order for someone else... He gave a wrong instruction even after few calls,btohqsg
6. Finally I went down and realised I will have to go take lift from another block  which connected to this one,btohqsg
Nabei. 7th floor climb no joke... And 30mims wasted  other orders domino effect...I officially gone crazy for that hour. At least lots of calories burned,btohqsg
Sometimes  no choice  no jobs for 10mins  then get this one nearby  lols.But then usually  once you got a shitty job  then the rest of the jobs starts coming inLols!,btohqsg

Thank you for sharing this Bro. Respect! For new drivers  extremely helpful. It‚Äôs just amazing to observe all these unethical users around. The response from the owner was very much defensive. Why on earth drivers would want to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù that couple of dollars? Always take the orders with our feet  not our knees. Help each other to protect that sense of dignity. We do not need to beg for that little money.,btohqsg
Ohhh yes yesterday i saw it too,btohqsg

Money was deducted from wallet. üò°üò°üò°I will fight for my right later today.,btohqsg
Suspend is so easy....to chat with them.....like transmitting msg to mars......,btohqsg

Faggot. I told C's dun cancel my order. Specific order. Dun cancel. Because I agreed with he sender that they will cancel on their end  as they needed 30more minuted.But CS seemed can't wait to cancel. And then now I have to answer on the cancellation order. They make it strict but super lenient on their customer service. These customer service should get the salary deducted!,btohqsg
