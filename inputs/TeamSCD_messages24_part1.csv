My PS4 and PS4S are on different cars with different performance level.for PS4 in 18 inch  it directly replaces my Goodyear F1 Asym. What I felt was quieter and less road feedback. Tires are more comfortable and definitely more grippy in the wet. another noticeable difference is that on the Goodyear F1  when i floor the pedal  tires will spin a bit first before it grips and launches. Whereas for the PS4  it grips directly without much spin. I also changed the front from 235 to 225 which I get better steering feedback after the change.. For that  I can say that I enjoyed the PS4 more than the Goodyear F1.For the PS4S in 19 inch  I have the front in Pzero in 245 and rear in PS4S in 265. Drive quality is definitely feels more performance level compared to PS4 but not really comparing apple with apple because different vehicle. Grip wise is fantastic  total confidence on the road even when wet. tires don't spin unless i floor the pedal hard. sidewall rigidity is great. Overall a better tire  great comfort and good grip in most of our weather conditions,btohqsg
And yes PS4S comes in 177 sizes available.https://www.michelin.com.sg/auto/tyres/michelin-pilot-sport-4-s#sizes,btohqsg
