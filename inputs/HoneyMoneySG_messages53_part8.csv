Hi anyone able to explain the DBS offset promo in layman terms? üôèüèΩüôèüèΩ,btohqsg
Wanted to check  I have setup giro for credit card payment 2 months ago and confirmed with HSBC that the giro is set up. My SCB credit card is due tomorrow 8th July  but I dont see any deduction from HSBC yet. Is it normal? I have citibank credit card due on 10th July as well.,btohqsg
They heard my questions  just received SMS that the amount was deducted. üòÇ,btohqsg
If I am not wrong  only 2.5 cashback points ?      But SC smart card Transportation got 6% üò¢. Don't know which to get .,btohqsg
May I know why the flame üî• replies? I thought it‚Äôs good for bidders as it‚Äôs higher than last round‚Ä¶ however  I think it has attracted awareness and more bids next round  let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶,btohqsg
U comparing apple to orange.HSBC Revo is a general spend card. So rewards slightly lower.SC Smart is specific spend card.Also the 6% might revert back to 5% once promo period over. But higher % on specific merchants.If u can‚Äôt decide  get both since both no annual fee no min spend.Spend on SC Smart for those merchants and on HSBC on everything elsePs HSBC Revo don‚Äôt give 9x points on bus/mrt hor. Must remember.,btohqsg
Hi anyone has any idea how the pro rated for new card holder for uob one credit card works. Let's say I miss the $500 spending for July(just received the card today) but able to spend $500 for Aug and Sep? Thanks,btohqsg
Your 1st month is prorated. Ie u don‚Äôt need to spend the full $500 on the 1st month. But u need to spend $500 min on qualified transactions on month 2 and 3 onwards.Tip is to call the bank to find out what your pro rates amount is. They will tell u and also share with u that u need to spend the pro rated amount for month 1 and 2 by the end of month 2.,btohqsg
My reply above.Your July pro rated amount u need to call bank to find out.Double confirm if u can spend the July prorated amount In august. They should tell u yes coz they also know that clients can sign up anytime n get their card end of month also.So they usually combine month 1 and 2 spending .,btohqsg
So for eg month 1 is 300 and month 2 is 700?,btohqsg
Your UOB ONE cycle is July  Aug  Sept. this is permanent and cannot change.Your $50 rebate for meeting this 3mth cycle will be credited end Oct (11:59:59pm) to offset the spending on Oct which u will have to pay on Nov.,btohqsg
U going for $500/mth quota right?,btohqsg
If i dont rmb wrongly‚Ä¶if you hit the min spend 2 out of 3 months your cashback will be prorated to 2/3 of it (ie 2/3*50 assuming you have no bonus cashback),btohqsg
So I can don't spend for Aug?,btohqsg
31 days in July -7 days = 24 days to hit pro rated July quota.500/mth / 31 x 24 days = about $387.I think u better call the bank just to be sure.My estimates is that u have to spend about $387 for July.Just confirm the amount that u need to spend for July and ask UOB if u need to spend this in July or can u spend this by end Aug.Ie July prorated amount + Aug $500,btohqsg
hi  anyone knows maybank save up account interest for 100k? does salary credit can use pay now ?,btohqsg
no...you need 5 qualifying spend to get cashback. and the 5 qualifying spend is per month not per quarter,btohqsg
Hi Joshua  for everyone‚Äôs benefit  do go to the MAS website to find out more on the T bills process of application. You need to have an account with one of the 3 Singapore banks to enable online application. Hope that helps üëçüèª,btohqsg
Min 5 qualifying transactions per monthGo take bus/mrt 5 times orGo ntuc buy cheapest thing 5 times (cheapest thing is $0.05 plastic bag)Buy 5 plastic bags,btohqsg
The plastic bags thing is a jokeBut still‚Ä¶It‚Äôs a good hack for anyone who needs clock transactions count,btohqsg
NTUC plastic bag now got barcode at the bottom that u can scanMost supermarkets have a barcode now at the self checkout counter,btohqsg
