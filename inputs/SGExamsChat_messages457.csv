Their median last year was 86.25,btohqsg
From these convo’s I gather  y’all are not gonna have a lot of Uni peeps,btohqsg
Every yr roughly the same ah,btohqsg
If you don’t make it to Uni after A’s what happens?,btohqsg
They will raise/drop requirements based on performance mah,btohqsg
Join the rest of the 70% of ur cohort,btohqsg
Hope they at least found great friends in jc,btohqsg
I have JP students and apparently on their side this isnt true,btohqsg
your students text you while receiving results…,btohqsg
If it was me I wouldn’t even be able to remember my tutor’s name HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Nah is a confusion of ppl faking stuff on reddit,btohqsg
Either case 81.5 is insanely impressive for JPJC,btohqsg
this is the first time in like 5 years that i’ve kept up with A level stuff i think,btohqsg
Even blurriness can’t take away the fact you know what these books are,btohqsg
They are a secondary school icon,btohqsg
Bro some of the stuff online cap,btohqsg
ok that explains why i dk LOL,btohqsg
But then three letters is iconic,btohqsg
i didn’t practice for a levels lol,btohqsg
i told you i didn’t care,btohqsg
i still have my physics revision packages btw,btohqsg
RI mean 84.4 according to their website,btohqsg
How is 9 distinctions even possible,btohqsg
I thought it’s 3h2 + 1h1 / 4H2s,btohqsg
Plus GP & PW & MT,btohqsg
4 H2 + GP  PW  MT  2 H3 lor,btohqsg
but I guess it's RI anything is possible,btohqsg
I thought you don’t take the H2 if you’re taking the H3??,btohqsg
I think you can take H2 maths and H3 further maths,btohqsg
i rmb someone on here doing that before,btohqsg
Do these people like really have no life,btohqsg
Pretty sure 3H3 is only possible in NUS high,btohqsg
But what I’m saying is that,btohqsg
Any Ivy League applicant knows how bullshit the admissions process is LOL,btohqsg
For e.g winning a silver medal at a competition with only 2 participants,btohqsg
Instead of saying I finished last and won silver,btohqsg
Someone pls remind me Highest RP is ?,btohqsg
All of them A for math n chem,btohqsg
i have a friend  that decided he is going ib after sec school,btohqsg
Anyways 80+ for RP good anot,btohqsg
I know ASR is really quite good,btohqsg
I only know jpjc this year fking good,btohqsg
YIJC hasn’t had a single 90RP yet,btohqsg
Hoya MI had 3 90RPs before eight,btohqsg
my MI student managed to help him to B 😄,btohqsg
my classmate got 90 rp too  another got 89 💀,btohqsg
I like how 88.75 is rounded off to 89 😂,btohqsg
so 79.8 something confirmed 80 ah?,btohqsg
I'm on call w my jr,btohqsg
I mean ig you’re the 9,btohqsg
So bad you need to actually try,btohqsg
i think pass is can go uni,btohqsg
kuro we’re listening   or maybe only me,btohqsg
yall will be battling with them cca points,btohqsg
Bruh is this YI's worst batch?,btohqsg
i mean there is private uni,btohqsg
So the 10% figure is real,btohqsg
I checking with my friend's siblings alr,btohqsg
I know my YI student did quite bad overall,btohqsg
A for higher mother tongue in olvls is counted as distinction too,btohqsg
Nono but I know they offer H3s,btohqsg
nothing wrong with being a mugger,btohqsg
The guy who told me graduated in 2017 so maybe it’s different,btohqsg
Wait wait so the YIJC 10% figure,btohqsg
almost everyone scores A or B for P,btohqsg
wait so what actually is your RP,btohqsg
with ur soon to be oct pay,btohqsg
just went hdl for lunch to pre celebrate student results,btohqsg
what does grf stand for tho,btohqsg
who do i owe a treat to,btohqsg
how come u so rich now,btohqsg
i not rich but i make enough,btohqsg
i think if i went spf,btohqsg
i don want to spend any more time in the place...,btohqsg
idk can’t believe u treat $47,btohqsg
i think you would prefer ocs over oct,btohqsg
isnt ocs and oct same thing no,btohqsg
i think wont even be as bad,btohqsg
This is what the red rhino used to look like,btohqsg
Guys do yall think igp will be higher,btohqsg
i mean rj median is 88,btohqsg
admissions to unis in general get more and more competitive each year,btohqsg
cause the talent pool is getting smaller every year,btohqsg
I think the scores pretty same tho,btohqsg
on surface yes but oct is more mental game,btohqsg
anyway igp is a very very rough estimation only,btohqsg
didnt take a level but how come school got median 88 one wtf,btohqsg
I thought bell curve so should be somewhat normalised,btohqsg
I hear from my seniors also,btohqsg
hc and ri alw been 88 median no?,btohqsg
really meh  i thought usually lower,btohqsg
its just last time they say the mean,btohqsg
Then hci is median is it,btohqsg
my year was 263 for RI,btohqsg
it's gone down over the years,btohqsg
oh legit mine was 261 or smtg,btohqsg
my mum told me not to go ri,btohqsg
Guys what RP do u need to get for private Uni in SG?,btohqsg
you compare what you're paying for other schs vs ri/hci etc,btohqsg
i mean my side is my mum single parent 3 kids so like,btohqsg
Only some schools got chance stay hostel though :),btohqsg
as in same as most schools,btohqsg
so it was like the best sch i could go to without spending few hundred,btohqsg
then after subsidy its 100 only,btohqsg
uhh i think my parents didn't know better,btohqsg
not like i'd know how to do this research at 12 lol,btohqsg
100 is in fact 4x 25,btohqsg
but yah 100/month isnt a lot,btohqsg
at most just less pocket money,btohqsg
dont u get this special letter to tell u received the scholarship and how it works,btohqsg
i dont really remember the details,btohqsg
but the opportunities RI gives compared to even DHS is so different,btohqsg
sad in hindsight but inconsequential ig,btohqsg
maybe in your time? cos i didn't get anything,btohqsg
but like my mentee got into RI and i see what she can go for,btohqsg
yeah fr they have these weirdo clubs thingy that my brother refuses to join  defeats the purpose of him going ri don’t even know why he’s there atp,btohqsg
Dhs H3 research not bad thats all i know,btohqsg
RI has an insane amount of research opportunities for those interested in sci,btohqsg
Bro had a chance to be council n rejected it idek atp,btohqsg
I lucky my time RJ is govt sch,btohqsg
i was there recently to judge some physics tournament,btohqsg
nush high achiever can basically do whatever u want,btohqsg
i talked to some of the students,btohqsg
lol that's me in pri sch,btohqsg
$1 noodle was the big size,btohqsg
Oh and Old sounds the same,btohqsg
i cant believe im alr turning 20 siah,btohqsg
1/2 at least pass one a level1/10 pass all 4,btohqsg
i just rmb my year dhs was 260 so RI was quite a big higher,btohqsg
btw i went to dig up my H2 physics stuff that i kept,btohqsg
kinda but i'm just laughing at how empty it is,btohqsg
maybe if i arranged the colours better,btohqsg
Hmm that's more than my A lvl physics materials,btohqsg
when I was studying A lvl,btohqsg
thats more than i ever dtudied for a’s,btohqsg
hows the cohort percentage for yall schs ah,btohqsg
i kept them cos in y1 of uni i’m like,btohqsg
maybe i’ll use them to revise,btohqsg
can enter the course i want damn safe alr,btohqsg
but for sure sign on time,btohqsg

every year its about this level of statistic,btohqsg
Last year was 1 in 2 67.5 ro and above,btohqsg
So I take a lvl next year,btohqsg
last year was supposedly not so standard for maths and super tough for chem,btohqsg
I heard this year physics hard,btohqsg
reach another record number of A and B students.,btohqsg
They did comment database was tough that's about it.,btohqsg
If u wan spf  be prepared to be loaded with work  unless ur lucky enuf,btohqsg

oh ye always got such stories,btohqsg
How recent is this? The most recent one was-,btohqsg

if she considering cs what should she gun for minimally,btohqsg
My cousin 85 in ce nus,btohqsg
well she in j1 taking part in cyberthon with some computing kids,btohqsg
i think 85 is super attainable for her,btohqsg
but then she just started at ri so,btohqsg
cos she also not sure what exactly she wants yet but trying to dip her toes to see,btohqsg
AFAIK  ri kids either do damn damn good or horrible,btohqsg
their lower 50% this year averaged 78,btohqsg
even then i want see the spread,btohqsg
I thought u say went army la fuck,btohqsg
if anyone goes ntu physics or engineering i might ta them heh,btohqsg
next year lab see if can ta you,btohqsg
i mean i don’t have classes after this sem so it’s quite easy to schedule on my end LOL,btohqsg
If i see your name i'll opt for your timing,btohqsg
you can see our names before registering meh,btohqsg
And then let the stars guide me,btohqsg
Oh wait i mean add drop oops,btohqsg
Do yall know how ny did,btohqsg
Once u start working in ur first job   that thing will be thrown out,btohqsg
After NS. I ‘m tied to reservist & manning. I hate it. pre-NS life was better. Less strings attached,btohqsg
isit true girls sign on guys dl,btohqsg
ik (i think) it isnt true but still,btohqsg
Yea. somewhat true. But not 100%,btohqsg
My friend ‘s bf is her cousin who signed on as well,btohqsg
cos got guys find girls that sign on “too manly” but those shouldn’t even be in a rs,btohqsg
uni you rlly see all the diff kind of guys lol,btohqsg
to many uni is like their last chance of finding someone proper,btohqsg
then they’ll end up doing anything to get someone,btohqsg
ya thatz wat one of the guys ik who said that is,btohqsg
anyway if you are a decent person just fuck care guys that judge,btohqsg
Some ppl alw wna feel like a child,btohqsg
btw ik people shit on ns but when you go uni you rlly see how it changes a lot of guys,btohqsg
Like chng them for the better or?,btohqsg
but like for many girls the first two years of uni you can kinda see how they’re still stuck in jc mindset,btohqsg
Depends. There ‘s one guy I know so not chill. Like still very rigid,btohqsg
I rmb the way he walk and act. Rly like Robot,btohqsg
u see the face also like too serious alr,btohqsg
U think 78 ok anot for rp,btohqsg
I find it q sus that rj didnt release median and hc didnt release mean,btohqsg
grab $30 but luckily we went as 4 dudes,btohqsg
good for yi  its a mental boost ngl,btohqsg
One of my student from mi,btohqsg
HE IS THE LAST PERSON I EXPECTED,btohqsg
MI really a place for second chances,btohqsg
Was he like the only 90RP from MI,btohqsg
All my seniors are cum lords,btohqsg
I want to be like em,btohqsg
Wow I know who that is,btohqsg
I want to be like you,btohqsg
I heard but I didn’t believe HAHAHA,btohqsg
