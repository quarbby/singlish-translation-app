With the year end coming to an end  i would like to do a CPF topup for my parents account. They are over 60 years old and are eligible to withdraw their CPF whenever they want. I would withdraw the 8k subsequently. Would this be a good strategy to reduce my taxable income by 8k for YA2023? Thanks,btohqsg
Will Chris answer our CPF related question here?,btohqsg
It's workable  locking your 8k into their RA for CPF life payouts while you take back 8k from them in cash.,btohqsg
Interestingly UOB KF gives a diff title,btohqsg
Hi friends  in a scenario where I’m in my mid 50s  I have $500k sitting around in a bank  what would be a good investment strategy (tbills  savings acc  etc)Would appreciate some suggestions  as I’m thinking of putting like $100k in tbills every month and rotating the money to get a small constant stream of income,btohqsg
If u meet uob one interest requirement  can consider putting 100k there for the 5% interest.,btohqsg
Facts about cpf strategy  yesPersonal strategy for your own situation  no (not licensed),btohqsg
Yea  only downside is need to use uob credit card… but will consider  thanks :),btohqsg
$500k constantly revolving in say 4% tbills (will surely go down soon) is approx $20k a year or $1.67k a month of passive income.You should consider deploying into higher return investments.,btohqsg
Hmm  yea but is there any alternatives that are as “no risk” as tbills?,btohqsg
Bank savings accounts I guess. Watch out for promos and read the tncs to try and earn over 4% pa.,btohqsg
Want higher returns sure must take some risks. So it’s a balance.,btohqsg
Yea understood  will keep a lookout for those promos 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Fixed deposits from Hong Leong Bank & Bangkok Bank  min $100K/200K  3.6% for 12 mths as of Oct.,btohqsg
Mine is from the Uni to miles conversion.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  anyone knows where we can track the total taxable income relief we will get after CPF topup is made? Did a $1 topup to CPF MA using e-cashier but can’t see any indicator,btohqsg
I don’t think there’s an official indication until you get your tax NOA next year,btohqsg
There’s one Widget if one tops up SA (Under Retirement dashboard)  but don’t see that relief number change after topping up MA,btohqsg
Have to manually track and calculate,btohqsg
Lol ok  looks like MA visibility not well-covered by CPF team. Thanks all!,btohqsg
Do you know whether e-cashier topup confirm will show up next year in tax NOA?,btohqsg
I havent done that for myself before 😅,btohqsg
Hi I just signed up for the hsbc revolution credit card via singsaver where the sign up promotion says I need to send a minimum amount of sgd500 by next calendar month in order to be entitled for $350 cashback.Can I ask if spendings on hotel booking defined as qualifying spend?,btohqsg
Hi  Is there a way where we can see how many points are rewarded per transaction for a DBS credit card ?,btohqsg
Depending on the MCC. Note HSBC Revo has been nerfed effective 1Jan onwards,btohqsg
Anybody apply credit card through singsaver for their gifts? I have already redeem my gift.  Just want to know if i can cancel the credit card already.,btohqsg
any workaround for Amaze on Apple devices?,btohqsg
@chuachengtatI read through the list of transaction type they have excluded.Doesn't mention anything about hotel booking.This means hotel booking spending should qualify?,btohqsg
Actually  i think SQ grouped Citibank cards under citi premiermiles. I don’t even have citi premier card though i have the Citi Rewards Card.,btohqsg
Ibanking > chatbot > rewards > points per transaction. Only posted transactions will display the points earned,btohqsg
thank you. how will the rewards system work for transaction we converted to installments?,btohqsg
It's on the main page for Revolution card. Effective from 1 Jan 2024,btohqsg
