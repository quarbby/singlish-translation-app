Need to use landing page  selected flights  selected cities  selected dates. Today is last day.https://www.flyscoot.com/promotions/dbs,btohqsg
How do i know is which date? I dont see any strikethrough,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt see the strikethrough  it means either the 20% promo was sold out or not applicable to that flights.,btohqsg
If you transfer to DBS from UOB how? Does it reflect as ICT? If it doesn't means your transfer is not correctly setup.,btohqsg

Since more than $100k only get 0.05%  don't want to keep excess cash inside the uob one account. i think i confused it with the ocbc360  that's the one that i need to transfer out same day to avoid messing up the adb. since uob one is mab  don't have to do same-day transfer out right?,btohqsg
So I'll only be able to see any cashback amt in the quarterly statements is it?,btohqsg
Your cashback is by statement quarter,btohqsg
