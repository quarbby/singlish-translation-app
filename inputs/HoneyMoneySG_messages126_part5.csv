Dont think it mentions anything about transport so I assume its covered,btohqsg
But for ocbc 365  it explicitly says it covers SimplyGo. But for infinity it does not say that,btohqsg
R u talking abt using the credit card itself to tap or using the credit card to top up your ezlink or now its called simplygo card,btohqsg
Can refer to page 3 of your CBS report on the possible factors causing the ratings to drop. Applying for many lines of credit within a short time increases your risk score.,btohqsg
Hi anyone kena unauthorized transaction from amaze card?This is my first time kenaLinked to CRMCIt take 45-90daysShall I pay to bank first seems this take long processing time?,btohqsg

Just to check for ibkr withdrawal? Only 1 withdrawal per month is free..the rest is $15 per month? Why so expensive? Is there any way to go around it?,btohqsg
Don’t withdraw more than once a month. Or use another broker for the holdings u plan to regularly sell away  eg moomoo those kind,btohqsg
Ibkr does transfer outs using telegraphic transfers. So it costs them money therefore restricted to one free a month.Even if u use a full fledged private bank you also may not get unlimited tt out per month.,btohqsg
Oh funny...cos my friend told me it is $1 using local electronic transfers,btohqsg
Can use Grab wallet and top up with UOB Absolute. Only 0.3% though. Not much n works only with paynow tied to uen.Paynow tied to mobile  I just use GooglePay n hope the scratch card gives me some rebate. Usually end up with Suntec parking points though.🙄,btohqsg
I searched high and low for this option but cannot find,btohqsg
No I mean using the credit card to tap,btohqsg
Best card for Agoda in foreign currency?,btohqsg
Thanks.Since Infinity offers cashback for Simplygo and a host of other things. Plus no minimum spend. I think its the best option to pair with my 360 account,btohqsg
Technically your “min spend” needs to be 500 since that’s the amount you need to spend to get the bonus interest for 360.,btohqsg
hi between moomoo & webull  which gives a higher return in money market funds investment (SG)? tx!,btohqsg
Well min spend is 500 for 50 cashback if you think of it that way.,btohqsg
Right but if I do ocbc 365 account then I need to do a min spend of $800 for the tier cashback right?,btohqsg
ocbc infinity no min spend ah,btohqsg
It's 0.6% pa interest gives you every month for 100k mab,btohqsg
Don’t really understand your point in mentioning the interest amount,btohqsg
min $800 is for ocbc 365 card not ocbc infinity,btohqsg
Because you mentioned 500sgd min spend for that interest amount,btohqsg
Yes. Thats what I'm saying. Infinity does not have a min spend while 365 you need to spend $800 every month for Tier 2 cashback,btohqsg
Yea but wasn’t in reference to the interest amount but more towards the point where even tho infinity is a no min spend card by itself  you still need to hit 500 to get the bonus interest. If not what’s the point,btohqsg
Yeap. But if I can only hit around $500 min spend per month then no point getting 365 right. Since I need to adjust my spending habits to hit $800 every month,btohqsg
Yep cannot hit 800 then just get ocbc infinity better.,btohqsg

Another option will be to include the Rewards card for the 4 or 6mpd purchases  then the remainder to infinity. So you dont really need to spend $500 on infinity.,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone can recommend which earn miles credit card with no expiry air miles is best choice? Planning for euro trip,btohqsg
Cards with no expiration for miles are general spend cards. Won't really recommend them for miles earning purpose. Have a look at 4mpd cards instead.,btohqsg
I heard that exchange rate may be higher on a Monday itself  is it true and should I make payment today (Sunday) if it involves USD exchange rate at hotels?,btohqsg
Weekend rate usually higher as market is closed,btohqsg
Will doing payment tomorrow be better than today? Thank you!,btohqsg
Maybe you can try when markets are opened?,btohqsg
Seeking advice from uob krisflyer card expert here... Do I still earn uncap 3mpd if I buy Air China airtickets fromtrip.com?,btohqsg
Assuming I can spend $800 on SIA / Scoot flight for other trip.,btohqsg
Hi  citi reward expert here  correct me if im wrong  Amaze card paired better to use physically as it will register as online transaction  eligible for 4md?Means in physical store i dont use my citi card?,btohqsg
Can also add to Google pay to get 4Mpd too right?,btohqsg
I was thinking also  can someone  confirm,btohqsg
I have not gotten it for the month of Jul 2024 leh.,btohqsg
Yes  google pay link to amaze,btohqsg
Ok  anyways isit better to use Amaze paired w citi (just gotten) or Youtrip (ive been using this for the longest) as an overseas card?Hows the exchange rate isit better,btohqsg
Rate wise definitely youtrip wins(better)  but u got no rewards or anything. Meanwhile amaze+crmc has like a slight spread fcx close to 2%  but u get to clock 4mpd  which is worth for most people here I would say,btohqsg
Unless u already hit the $1000 on crmc  then go for youtrip or other cc,btohqsg
I see  thanks for the clarification  🙏,btohqsg
No worries. Happy to help :),btohqsg
Hi does it make sense to use card up or any other service for Telco or tax payment cause that extra % kinda seem not worth it?,btohqsg
"In general  it's a way to ""buy"" miles. Worth it or not then have to see ur own value of miles. UOB prvi visa for income tax isn't too bad value.",btohqsg
