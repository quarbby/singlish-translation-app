Seems like the new implementation on the coe quota causes the quicker increase on the coe prices . Super shag .,btohqsg
can give GR a run for their money imo  just not as popular only,btohqsg
I have a better answer to the rise in price. I believe that due to Covid  most of the cars mileage is below 100k and in good condition. Hence most people will choose to renew for 5 or 10 years. As there is no deregistration  no growth means no extra quota,btohqsg
no new coe will mean less supply in turn lead to higher coe prices,btohqsg
i believe 100k for cat A is attainable and maintain for at least another year for high coe,btohqsg
