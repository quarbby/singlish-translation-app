⭐️Pika World Morning Update⭐️Nasdaq and and Dow Jones Industrial index have both made new high this year.S&P 500 which has been dragged by lackluster performance in banking and industrial counter is catching up as the rally is broadening.Russell 2000 is baldy beaten by high bond yield and the concern of economic recession is outperforming among all indices.Many have asked if I am holding any Chinese holdings. Indeed  I do have them but as discussed in 2021 and 2022 write-up  China is burdened by its weak bond market for the past 3-4 years. This year is no different. Unless we see the prospect of turnaround or release of fiscal policy by the Chinese government  we see lipping recovery.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
