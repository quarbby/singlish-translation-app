I was thinking maybe can use ShopeePay to circumvent the AMEX issue since most merchants don’t accept Amex,btohqsg
Last time still ok to use GPMC overseas coz 1.2% grab points and 1.7% UOB Absolute.Then after this nerf… no point to use GPMC overseas. RIP.Back to YouTrip…,btohqsg
My current strategy is using Revolut 1% metal cash back card ever since Grab nerf and since I travel more frequently in this period and they provide travel insurance.,btohqsg
Plus Citi + amaze on weekends,btohqsg
Now the issue I face is because I’m using UOB ONE credit card then all those spending above the $500 quota or $1k quota doesn’t add to my rebates so my backup strategy for UOB Absolute + GPMC doesn’t really make sense anymore.,btohqsg
I mean  I still use GPMC to pay for income tax  HDB conservancy fees and insurance via AXS+ GPMC but 0.3% rebate is meh.Not sure if even worth the trouble to jump thro hoops to save a few $,btohqsg
Just applied Amex TCB card hope it don’t get nerf 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,btohqsg
Yes I need it to top up grab Mastercard for my AXS payment,btohqsg
That’s that only way to still earn cashback on Grab top ups,btohqsg
Ie to replace UOB Absolute with AMex TCB 1.5%,btohqsg
Yes the only way for now,btohqsg
Remember TCB 3% welcome gift excludes GrabPay topups,btohqsg
Amex had been the most resilient actually. I don’t see it nerfing their rebates.It’s usually the banks that carry their version of AMEX that do,btohqsg
Hopefully . If TCB also nerf there is no other way Liao,btohqsg
i keep reading TCB as Tan Cheng Bock,btohqsg
can I confirm if this Telegram channel HoneyMoneySG1 is it really by Honey Money?,btohqsg
Any group with Chris's face on it is fake,btohqsg
Only the boss@ChrisHMSGcan confirm for you. As far as I know it’s real. If not my life was a lie,btohqsg
