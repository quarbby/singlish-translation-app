Sorry but coe cars just aint worth it now i feel,btohqsg
But 1 positive thing abt estima is that their interior quality seems to be better than their newer counterpart. Toyota quality seems to be going downhill. Seen quite a bit of noah voxy leather all cui. Arm rest all come out,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  local voxy n noah comes in fabric. But dealers send to workshop to have it leather wrapped. Thts y the leather quality is nt good,btohqsg
COE Estima is engine oil eater car.,btohqsg

"I did read somewhere that if you have been driving ""hard""  it might be good to let the car idle a while before you turn off the engine. Something along the lines of letting the eo cool down the engine etc.",btohqsg

EV have substantial incentives that reduces the arf  so end up little or no basis for resale value  end up is only the coe remaining since there's no arf component. Some still use the original arf to base on to sell,btohqsg
Then in this case... seems like its better to wait for coe to drop to go in? But by then the incentive might be removed as well?,btohqsg
