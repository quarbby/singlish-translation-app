A lot of questionable decisions but you do you... ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Best is to register for Jan and teansfer the fund in right away? But 17 May earmark date is less than 4 months from today.,btohqsg
Did this affect you in anyway?,btohqsg
Read and confused so have to seek adviceðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Less than 4 months? Depends on when you transfer  if count till so detailed of the days need to be exactly 4 months later  everyone earmarked date will be different,btohqsg
I mean isn't that to ur benefit.Its like say sign up on 1st earmark  date is 17th mroe than 4 monthOne thing it's going to be affected will be that month interest as ur daily banalmce will not be 100k,btohqsg
Just follow what the table says...1. Deposit 100k before 31 Jan 1030pm  register your UOB One account instead of your UOB Stash account...2. If you still haven't open the UOB Stash account  don't open it anymore. But if you have already opened it  deposit 1k by the end of 6th month to prevent the fall below fee if you intend to keep the account for whatever reason..3. If you don't intend to keep it  close it on the 7th month before the fall below fee happens.,btohqsg
My thought is if you are NTUC member and have been buying groceries from NTUC  you can go for Trust account with max 3% pa. The good thing is the interest covers until 500k. It gives flexibility to deploy your funds around and still earn reasonable returns.,btohqsg
If you put in the 100k in Feb  you wonâ€™t even get this monthâ€™s interest,btohqsg
Can go for GXS or maribank but at 2.x %. Or even syfe 4% for 3 months,btohqsg
For myself I'm going to register on the 31 st Jan and put in on  31st Jan get earmark  and credit on 29th Feb and end the earmark on 17 mayI think for ur case will be semilar to me,btohqsg
But if you have already registered or still decide to register your UOB Stash account for whatever reason  you need to prevent the fall below fee on your UOB One account..1. If your UOB One account is still within 6 months of opening  deposit 1k by the end of 6th month.2. If it's already past the 6 months of opening  deposit 11kTODAYto prevent the fall below fee.I don't see any reason for you to prioritise the UOB Stash account over UOB One account.. unless you prefer 3% over 5%?,btohqsg
If I put $100k on 31/01  what will be my MAB if my balance from 1-30 Jan is $0?,btohqsg
1. Have you opened your UOB Stash account yet?2. Have you registered for the Rising Dragon promo yet?,btohqsg
Yes. Bcos they post late. I lost $70 cash back from quarterly Maybank platinum visa.,btohqsg
Oof.. maybe next time pay earlier lol,btohqsg
I made the payment on Tuesday 2.45pm on GE portal. GE post the transaction on Sunday,btohqsg
The problem is I paid on 26  which is 5 days in advance. And its a Tuesday,btohqsg
Was it the Christmas week? Sunday still within the calendar month tho..,btohqsg
Nope. I remember  its Sep 26. Tuesday.,btohqsg
Ohh. Then it's not within the calendar month anymore. That's unfortunate.. just pay a week earlier lor  better to just pay and don't think about it. $70 lesson I guess.But not bad that they still give you $30 since they only brought in the $300 tier in Oct ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Sigh .... This shows how incompetent the GE cso. Write in letter of complaint also no use. Becos its the same people who answer my phone call and email. ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,btohqsg
No use to complain la.. you cannot say they do anything wrong because their main job is to give you insurance coverage not to help you get cashback lol.Just pay earlier lor.,btohqsg
Tbh the CSO also cant help you on this. This is under finance dept. +1 to what melvyn said above as well,btohqsg
Um that was 2 questions I asked but ok... lol,btohqsg
But if you want to know the amount  assuming you only have 100k and it's deposited on 31 Jan  it's 3225.80.,btohqsg
Karlssomehow telegram's own moderation removed your question regarding OCBC salary transfer to UOB One account. Have already reported it as false positive.You can find your answer here:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/164384,btohqsg
I already fulfilled minimum salary 1.6k and 1k spending on uob one account . Will it better for me to put in  another  100k today or wait till 31st jan 23 ?,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s your purpose of putting in another 100k?,btohqsg
$1k per month for 12 months.,btohqsg
I have available 100k cash  to put in . So any advice ?,btohqsg
Does your uob one already have 100k?,btohqsg
No yet.only 1.6k due to the salary credit.,btohqsg
You can put in the 100k now to hit the max cap and get the 5% interest every month but not sure if youâ€™re eligible for the rising dragon promo.,btohqsg
Im unable to hit that as my spending is also spread across other cards  is there another card you could recommend thatâ€™s more lenient on min. spending?I also have the dbs women world card  are they more lenient on minimum spending amount before having waiver?,btohqsg
If your 100k is currently in a bank account that gives more than 3.85% p.a.  deposit the remaining amount (100k - whatever is in your UOB One account) on 31 Jan.Else  just deposit it in today and get 3.85% p.a. on 11.1k. If you want to hit 100k MAB this month  you'll need to deposit 1m30k in  so no point to do so.Next month onwards you can get the 5% p.a. on 100k and transfer out the interest given each month.You can also opt for the Rising Dragon promo this month as long as you deposit 100k more than what you have on 30 Dec  1030pm.,btohqsg
Hi all can I know what 4mpd miles card to recommend for offline/contactless transaction that is lenient on annual fee for less than $1k spending/month? I wanted hsbc revolution but it doesnâ€™t cover certain big ticket items like medical expense/dental,btohqsg
4mpd cards donâ€™t cover medical though,btohqsg
Uob ppv covers right? Based on heymax. But just now someone mentioned need at least 1k spend per month to waive annual fee,btohqsg
currency my UOB bank account only have 1.6k. My 100k is in another bank account.So what you are saying   to deposit this 100k only on 31st jan ( it will be posted for 1st day of feb to get 5% PA)haha dun think i will want hit 100k Mab this month   like what u said   need to be 130k.,btohqsg
UOB quite easy to waive. Never spend much also can waive one. Yea PPV will cover as long as itâ€™s Contactless but limited to $1100 a month,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think so lehâ€¦ 8011 is doctor & physician  8021 is dental.I donâ€™t see it at the selected online purchases eligible for 4MPD,btohqsg
1.03m not 130k lolAnd yes  just deposit on 31 Jan and forgo this month's interest.,btohqsg
im referring to in person though  go see doctor and dental using contactless not online payment,btohqsg
If tnc says MCC not in excluding then it's okay. Just need to remember mobile contactless vs visa contactless.,btohqsg
U can try Uob evol. $600 per month spend.They advertised as long as u make 3 transactions a month. No annual fee.,btohqsg
im looking for miles card thats why ðŸ˜¢ im wondering if they will be lenient to waive uob ppv fee if i also uob lady's and both cards combined have $1k spend per month?,btohqsg
But if u didn't spend 600 on Evol but u spend 500 on uob one card will u still get the cashback & uob one u interest,btohqsg
Yeah uob one card is good for Uob one account,btohqsg
Can try loh but not guaranteed.,btohqsg
