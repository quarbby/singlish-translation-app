can if pay via singtel website (not app),btohqsg
I didn’t see properly earlier  paid through the app via AXS.. hahaha,btohqsg
via axs will not qualify sadly 🙁,btohqsg
Yeah that’s why :( it’s okay  next month I will pay through the website,btohqsg
Yup until they nerf duno when will thet remove it,btohqsg
Or u setup as recurring maybe still cah too via app,btohqsg
Hi guys  just wanna check for minimum spend (for rewards or monthly for cashback)  do we usually need to meet inclusions and exclusions list? Or just any spending to hit that amount can count?(mainly checking for first-time rewards  yuu's 600 and mb fnf 800 monthly),btohqsg
exclusions list usually wont count towards min spend. If you meant non bonus category spend  dbs yuu still counts as eligible spends towards 600$ req.,btohqsg
is it work with recurring payment on CRMC?,btohqsg
For DBS YUU if i use it to pay SP Utilities   does it count towards the $600 minimum spend?,btohqsg
Split payment for high value items to earn more rewards? You may need to bring physical cards for verification in the future.https://youtu.be/AnFfsfR_5Qc?si=K5dH3hA7VzW4_dVg,btohqsg
Seems like good practice. Probably to verify the name same for all the cards.,btohqsg
Anyone went to Tiger's Project Play last weekend to sign up for the 6.8% p.a return? They told me have to wait 24 Nov for the 6.8% coupons and $100 shopping vouchers to be in. That's like an extra 10 business days returns lost earning only 3% p.a parking at Philips Money Market . What's the overall nett return after including non business days and 9-23 Nov?,btohqsg
Lol. I withdraw immediately after deposit,btohqsg
So nett return is about 4.5% p.a before including the period 9-23 Nov. Still better than chocolate and hsbc I guess,btohqsg
I am not sure when they start to calculate “6.8%”. The day you deposit or the day you apply the coupon. If excluded 9-23 Nov  return will be a bit lower than 4.5%-4.6%.I did not participate.,btohqsg
That's why deposit 10k is good enough.,btohqsg
But u withdraw immediately after deposit  do u still get the $100 shopping vouchers?,btohqsg
Of course. Read terms and conditions. It doesn't ask you to hold. Only ask you to make a deposit,btohqsg
Have to do 10trades before you can withdraw the 6.8%.,btohqsg
That day I asked the staff on site  she say wouldn't get if withdraw prior receiving their email with shopping voucher,btohqsg
They just want you to hold without withdrawing.  Anyway you don't need. Just read through the whole T&C . Even term and conditions doesn't say anything about holding it,btohqsg
4.5%/4.6% is still a good interest rate. Most banks do not offer this rate anymore.,btohqsg
I got 5.5% from (6.8%*60/90+2.8%*30/90). Based on 60 working days and 30 we/ph earning mmf rate,btohqsg
Yea I also dumped into Philip MMF after deposited into tiger trade. 5.5% is good  better than bonds. Thanks.,btohqsg
I thought the total return after factoring in MMF return is $1117.80 as indicated in the TnC after 60 trading days ?Not sure how to interpret the TnC. My interpretation is after 60 trading days  you get about $1117.80(including the daily interest +  guaranteed return from coupon).,btohqsg
Yeah it's also unclear to me. 4.5% is correct if they just take 1117 net off whatever change in fund nav after 60 trading days. see if anyone else have past exp with tiger 6.8%,btohqsg
I wonder if they want to us to move to non credit card cashless payment like paynow and the likes.,btohqsg
The lady staff at Suntec did tell me to subscribe to Philips MMF to earn more than the promo rate 6.8%  so you are correct to also include 2.8% for the 60 working days + period 9 Nov-23 Nov,btohqsg
The problem for big households like mine. We share our cards.So one main card eg Uob one. We can share among 4-5 people now. Using a mix of physical and applepay.Of course we share cards all with permission from the main card holder.Hope the new developments don’t mess up our strategy.,btohqsg
Hi  for UOB Lady's card  does the 10X UNI$ for every S$5 spent apply to every transaction or the total amount transacted at the end of the month?,btohqsg
1x is per transaction9x is total amount of eligible spend posted in the calendar month,btohqsg
Later the person told you  you could apply for supplement card😂,btohqsg
We have cards shared by 5-10 humans,btohqsg
managing card usage at this scale is a feast itself,btohqsg
I actually feel a sense of achievement being the finance ministress managing cards and deposits for the household.,btohqsg
Hi folks  is there any way I can convert my Citi thank you points to virgin Atlantic ?,btohqsg
I found a great deal on roam but I don’t have any points thr,btohqsg
Don't think you can do that unfortunately.,btohqsg
