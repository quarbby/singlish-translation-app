All they need now is to get rid of the infotainment system and replace it with a more user friendly one,btohqsg
do you guys idle  your car for a long time after cold start?,btohqsg
Usually just wait a while  then drive off slowly,btohqsg
Newer vehicles don't need to 'warm up' (idle after cold start). The new engine designs allow for immediate start and drive off.,btohqsg
i dont wait at all. i just drive off - slowly  till it heats up adequately,btohqsg
If I have time  wait for it to get upto temp (90°)  if not  I wait for the revs to go back down first then drive slowly until engine upto temp,btohqsg
Wait around 30 to 45 sec before moving off  let the engine oil circulate first,btohqsg
you are wasting fuel. and burns more carbons,btohqsg
i on already then rev to 5k rpm,btohqsg
even on the old e30  i dont do this. i drive off immediately,btohqsg
slowly of course in the beginning,btohqsg
a daily car is well lubricated even the next day cold start,btohqsg
Rather waste a bit of fuel than see a big bill in the future because I never take care of the engine,btohqsg
dont think you understand engine internals well,btohqsg
maybe blocked by what you think will damage engine because you need to warm up.,btohqsg
give the engine the cold treatment and it will get stronger and stronger,btohqsg
i NEVER said revv. i say move off SLOWLY,btohqsg
so dont force your words on me,btohqsg
i say the way i do it,btohqsg
whjen you move off slowly you build temperature,btohqsg
but you know how to build temp faster?,btohqsg
if you drive your car daily  even when you stop your engine say the day before  the cam shafts etc are still coated with engine oil the next day you do cold start. as you know wear occurs when engine is cold because oil flows back to the sump,btohqsg
if you revv is too early too fast  you risk destroying engine because the oil aint hot yet. and hence flows slows. this risks oil reaching the important parts,btohqsg
what you said is correct  but for older engines  or V8s V6s  i believe warming up the engine before moving off would be a precautionary measure,btohqsg
nothing wrong w wasting a dollar or 2 if tht helps u sleep at night,btohqsg
then i observed how germans do it. in cold winter freezing temperature  he starts his car and move off immediately  albeit slow.,btohqsg
"one of them drives a Quattro. we might think they dont ""take care"" of engine. but soon  after engine oil heats up  they go balsting on autobahn",btohqsg
'Chiobu' sits on the centre console while taking a joyride around Sentosa in a Mazda MX-5Even though the speed limit at Sentosa is 50km/hr  this is still quite dangerous➡️ React with 🤬 if stern action should be taken against the driver!➡️ React with 😢 if you agree they ownself sabo ownself!👉🏻 Read the full storyhere!,btohqsg
so afterall  its not audi thats the problem  its the owner that causes audis to leak oil,btohqsg
it is not necessary at all. as you drive off  temperature builds up,btohqsg
honestly  slow speed okay la give chance let everybody have abit of fun,btohqsg
its not like they are driving very dangerously or at high speed,btohqsg
bro  no seatbelt + sitting on centre console leh,btohqsg
mehh i think majority of her body still inside of the car ba  but thats my own personal opinion.. nevertheless its still unsafe la and dont reccomend it,btohqsg
For me  it reminds me of this😂,btohqsg
