Some teachers very funny wanna teach kids but still say they cannot tahan them üòÖ,btohqsg
Lol everytime I see this kind of post‚Ä¶. I always wonder Maybe they are the toxic ones themselves,btohqsg
sometimes  its not just the kids but the parents too.. i have friends in education  both retired and current.. the stories they share... üòÇ,btohqsg
probably both ways.. most want to do good by the kids they teach and instruct / mold.two key factors from what my friends have shared:1) work Environment (colleagues / bosses / supportive or not)2) the students and by extension  parents themselves  what they expect of the teachers and how they communicate it.,btohqsg
so we're all toxic too? :L,btohqsg
There is no social media that aint toxic,btohqsg
Even telegram u meet toxic people from time to time,btohqsg
Parents these days basically useless  especially the younger parents everything also not happy and complain,btohqsg
Nothing to do with parentsJust the younger generation with the very entitled mindsetWhether parents or not,btohqsg
Ya but younger parents feel damn entitled and all make until teacher hard to do their actual job,btohqsg
