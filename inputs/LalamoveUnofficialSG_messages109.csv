4 places in the east and back to woodlands again,btohqsg
HAHAH i saw this also. Order still thereü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
It's really not easy still have to deliver the goods to the door step,btohqsg
Looking for urgent driver able to drive 10ft lorry . Delivery of chocolate . Able to start tomorrow. $10/location diesel and rental under own expenses .,btohqsg
lj book under bike then not applicable for bike,btohqsg
LJ drivers condone this type of LJ customers  they accept it and allow it to happen...that's why la,btohqsg
we have staff that will tag along with u to assist in delivery. Round trip to send her back.,btohqsg
This one really pro sia. Delivery people and send back somemore,btohqsg
I think it's getting more n more now. Prob cos there have been drivers who have been accepting these jobs. So more n more pple r trying their luck. Word will spread ard,btohqsg
And don't even think abt hoping lalamove will ban or stop these customers  cos lalamove is making money from them,btohqsg
We always wondering price so low etc  but always see the jobs will eventually be taken. So means out there still have alot of pple will take the jobs lor. Cannot underestimate the neediness of those who really need to make the money  be it for the families or what. Customers also know this  so they will keep taking advantage,btohqsg
Everyone have their own difficulties bah,btohqsg
Rather we shld b condoning these smelly customers instead  who take advantage of desperate drivers  but again llm won't do anytg to them cos they r the ones giving llm bizü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
I always tell them politely that I am not a Private Hire car so legally no license to ferry human especially in the event of an accident  claim will be rejected. If u are not polite  they will give you bad rating and then Lalamove will need to explain. So damn waste of time and stupid! Am moving on to do Private Hire after driving for 7 solid months. Getting demotivated ‚òπÔ∏è.,btohqsg
Yeah the prices are really low sometimes,btohqsg
PHV prices also sucky. unless weekends  pH or raining day.,btohqsg
Yah  there is always the fear they will give bad rating etc if we reject them or anytg. That's y I jdb n don't take those jobs,btohqsg
llm can stack one shot earn50- 60+  but phv cannot stack passenger. haha,btohqsg
Actually if they don't put a return trip sign there  or another drop in the job showing the end location  there's no obligation for us to do it. If they want to they shld add the drop in or the return trip charge,btohqsg
If they write in comments  u have the right to tell them add the return drop charge or additional drop n mileage fee,btohqsg
by right cannot ferry passenger along. if halfway accident then tua ki liao,btohqsg
Then those who take the job better ask for the additional fees,btohqsg
passenger play dirty sue the driver worst....,btohqsg
This 1 is cfm cannot 1,btohqsg
They don't dare reject or cancel the job after getting it. Cancel kena suspension. Reject later kena bad rating. Or they just really need to make the money bah,btohqsg
How do you guys stack orders?,btohqsg
Like I said  it's all the bad customers who r responsible for all these shit. Take advantage of those who need to earn the money,btohqsg
Yes I always stack minimum 2 for peak hours and maximum 5. But lately very tough exclude (special occasions like last weekend). Need to take schedule jobs but need to keep looking at the app. Too long hours spent. I am doing this PT and only on weekends. Able to earn at $200 nett per day but this job is tougher than PH. I should be able to earn more doing PH for the same amount of hours put in.,btohqsg
this is where llm put their driver in a dilemma situation. llm sucks. lol,btohqsg
me too.. slowly I realize bo hua. haha.,btohqsg
waaa u still will go park in CP ah. lol. I never do that.,btohqsg
have to stack. no stack how to earn. llm always don't let us stack but the prob is with the rising petrol price... have they ever spare a thought for us? NO LO.. they only wanna earn their comm n shake leg while we suffer,btohqsg
LLM is still the best among the delivery apps but still lose out to PH. I started with PH as I do not like to transport people.,btohqsg
Agree the price is still highest if I'm not wrong. Just that can't stack too many n that jobs have to bid,btohqsg
N of cos the back end support is very bad,btohqsg
Price:Base fare $12 (under 1km) + $1/km (first 3km) + $0.45/kmAdditional stop charge:+$5Weight limit:20 kgSize limit (L √ó W √ó H):70 √ó 50 √ó 50 cmAdditional services:-,btohqsg
I die die won't accept passengers. The consequences if anytg were to happen is too much to handle,btohqsg
If its ferry passenger  I will reject. If llm suspend me  I will write in email say I'm not phv  against law to ferry. If they still suspend  tell them send email to authorities etc,btohqsg
See whether they still dare suspend,btohqsg
Weight limit 20kg. The stuff I delivery yesterday confirm more than 20kg liao,btohqsg
Llm will bully if they see we don't dare don't dare. I no scared this 1. If I'm not in the wrong I will fight to the end. But if the comments of the job got write need bring passenger I won't take it. Or else they later say comments write liao who ask me take the job,btohqsg
if play law with llm they sure scare . lol,btohqsg
If live chat with LLM CS they will ask you to bring a weighing scale. I told them why don‚Äôt you try out this job yourself. Talk is easy.,btohqsg
Yah there r jobs whereby they nvr write. If I kena I will just tell them either u give me trolley use  or u get pple help me. Cos its their fault nvr write need trolley. I will take all photos. If they no trolley no pple help I will just tell them I can't do it.,btohqsg
aiya llm also bullshit. u fuck the CS then they say will ban and remove u. end up also can do again. lol,btohqsg
that day I took a job at factory area .. total weight over 30kg+,btohqsg
Sometimes we cannot blame the guards. They have their own set of rules to follow from building management,btohqsg
knn the user should book a van or lorry la. why book car,btohqsg
furthermore never state need trolley or anything. remarks is blank. how we know what to expect,btohqsg
No helper no trolley then I just reject lor. They want complain I can back it up with photos etc.,btohqsg
Remember cannot give in all the time. If its really heavy y risk the injury. If complain to llm n llm want suspend just show them the proof.,btohqsg
If get injured  later cannot work for awhile  income loss. That 1 no1 will sympathise with us,btohqsg
They will only say who ask u want to carry on doing the job,btohqsg
If very heavy means prob more than 20kg  exceed car job limit liao,btohqsg
It's not just that 1 item hor,btohqsg
It should b all items add up,btohqsg
Cos we can normally carry the 5 10kg rice when we buy groceries,btohqsg
So u can agar know the weight,btohqsg
Even if u don't have weighing scale,btohqsg
This delivery is for 11:45 am. Please call recipient before delivery.Please send photo of delivery to pick-up‚Äôs contact number. Do not contact customers at pick-up or drop-off for order cancellations.PICK 1: ORDER_ID QZAMY7-4:-DROP 2:[POD] Please send photo of delivery to  6581010059food[category] foodDROP 3:[POD] Please send photo of delivery to  6581010059food[category] foodDROP 4:[POD] Please send photo of delivery to  6581010059food[category] food,btohqsg
Wah piang still want us to send photos to the pickup,btohqsg
Got some jobs write this. But normally the job itself will say need sign off etc when u drop at each stop. There will b an option prompt u. Just follow it can liao. If don't have then bor bian,btohqsg
It's a standard template they use to write in the job comment,btohqsg
those job which requires trolley or us to carry heavy loads that comes with low fare   don't accept. we have to be united on this. let the price rise,btohqsg
I assume so. Cannot b 1 item max 20kg. Later they have 5 items all max 20kg that means 100kg load we have to transport ahüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Yes must work smart. Always use call log and photos as evidences to avoid penalty such as cash deduction and suspension  etc.,btohqsg
I wonder where u park at ion. the whole stretch of road is so congested ...,btohqsg
If can take fast then grace period,btohqsg
If cannot then pay. But only as long as the job has good enough price or +$ cover the cp,btohqsg
but cp also need to queue to drive in what.  after that have to find lot. time wasted,btohqsg
Depends on what time. I don't go in during peak time where have to q etc,btohqsg
whenever I drive pass that area the road is always congested leh. like no timing de. it's always jam hahaha,btohqsg
It's not like paragon n taka there,btohqsg
Ion n wisma still have times where not so jam,btohqsg
Have to know how it is if want to do town jobs,btohqsg
I also don't do jobs where u see from 1 resto send to another of their own resto,btohqsg
It's prob deliver stock. Sometimes it may be small thing. But sometimes can be alot of stuff,btohqsg
I did 1 job that day from pandan loop to resto in town,btohqsg
Take job liao then say send stock of fries n frozen meat. Total 5 boxes,btohqsg
How do you guys stack orders?,btohqsg
I told the sender I no trolley etc   u never state need,btohqsg
Told her I cannot load n unload myself. She say she arrange with the pickup n drop off. Pickup pt they help me load. Drop off pt they waiting with trolley when I reachüòÇ,btohqsg
Nvr reject cos sender say will arrange pple help me load n unload,btohqsg
It was during mothers day wkend. I don't want injure myself. Lugi the wkend like thatüòÇ,btohqsg
Little farm nvr write need trolley 1. So I very scared to pickup their stuff. Especially if its outlet to outlet. If its to their customer still ok,btohqsg
Basically we have to work smart n know when to stand up for our own rights n interests,btohqsg
this one super not worth. multiple trips always not worth unless locations are all nearby each other,btohqsg
3 jobs at one time should be comfortable and will not be late. For me I try to take 1 or 2 scheduled jobs in advance example orchard to Pasir Ris. Take jobs around the same area and with no difficulty in parking. I will take either 2 or 1 11am or 2 or 1 at 11.15am or 11.30am. In this way  you will not be late. When u take the 3rd or 4th job  you must take it more than 30 min before the next job. The app will know that you have advance jobs and will not allow u to take job if less than 30 mins. Hope I am clear with my explanation.,btohqsg
Wah this one really free exercise üò¢,btohqsg
Used to stack 3 even 4 b4. During covid lockdown. When traffic was smooth. Now at most I stack 2  cos wkend traffic especially in town now very bad. Don't want stress,btohqsg
Wah I'm sorry to hear that,btohqsg
Now getting abit harder to estimate time needed. Cos traffic bad n with more dine in  restos starting to be late with orders. All these r unknown factors which may screw up the stack n cause late,btohqsg
I don't want the stress so I don't stack so manyüòÇalso I norm don't take advanced jobs  cos price not that high. I still very choosyüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I only take scheduled jobs above $22. I spent a lot of time watching the app. If u don‚Äôt take scheduled jobs  very difficult to earn. The last weekends  I worked only Friday to Sunday and cash out $1169.,btohqsg
Everyone started doing stupid and silly jobs,btohqsg
Not yet sofa. If have should be today for one lateness but I am able to cover myself,btohqsg
That's very very very good amt. But I greedy lah  so I only take jobs after commission 20 aboveüòÇnormally will need either +$ or high demand charge. So I don't take scheduled jobs üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
U should not have waited. I wouldn‚Äôt wait,btohqsg
That's too long a time to wait. I don't mind wait if its my last job homeward bound for the day. But if during holiday or special occasion day with alot of high price jobs I won't waste time waitinf,btohqsg
Must know time is of utmost importance during such days,btohqsg
Each person has their own style. Most important make money and that matters,btohqsg
Yup  each has own style n preference. That's y I say to those who ask how to stack earn etc. Must go try out then know,btohqsg
What works for 1 might not work for another. What 1 wants might not be What another wants also lah,btohqsg
Wow today everyone so free ah? No need to work?,btohqsg
Wahhhh how many jobs u took,btohqsg
Taking scheduled jobs guarantee the income n can plan in advance. I'm a gambler n risk taker  so I wait for immediate actual day job high price. Sometimes get it sometimes don't üòÇ,btohqsg
37 jobs in 3 days. Hit all 4 levels of incentive.,btohqsg
LLM is good if you need to raise a sum of $$ for a specific purpose. Can be quite demoralizing if work long term.,btohqsg
I see quite a number of people driving phv after work just to pay for their car.,btohqsg
I really salute them. After work I alr so tired,btohqsg
Yes I used to do that. Free payment. But when covid came  Private Hire Business was badly affected.,btohqsg
I work full time Monday to Friday. Unable to do Lala on weekend,btohqsg
My friends did Private Hire and 2 days they earned $400 plus nett. 10 to 12 hours,btohqsg
Ytd aft work i only do 2 orders  after comm left 60+ only,btohqsg
2 Lalamove jobs u earned $60+? Very good already. Single or multi stops,btohqsg
No wonder so high. Multi stop is very tiring,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt like unless the rate is very high.,btohqsg
The highest job I did for project job was $18 per location. This was last Christmas and I had 20 jobs.,btohqsg
This kind of job can do but not those shown in the app. This was thru LLM sales office,btohqsg

And with traffic now getting back to pre covid days  bad traffic eats petrol even faster,btohqsg
EV mafan when u think of 2 HR charging time,btohqsg
unless your blk can charge or u stay landed,btohqsg
U mpv? But even then  don't think there are that many mpv jobs around. Then if u not mpv  car jobs with good price very little unless special days. N if no sticker  on normal weekdays those good priced jobs always have sticker drivers bidding nowdays  almost impossible to get,btohqsg
I tried bidding 2 good priced jobs just now  both have the lalabag/sticker msg appearüòÖ,btohqsg
Lala bag n star cash caltex needs to buy ?,btohqsg
Art test kit need to buy from llm ?,btohqsg
Means easily 3-4k per month on petrol alone,btohqsg
Might as well find a job that can pay you at least 2-3x that,btohqsg
Hi anyone got link for lalamove admin?,btohqsg

Lalabag u can don't buy  but u will be disadvantage when u bidding for the job against those with bagüòÇ,btohqsg

Think wkdays now just make enough for my wkly petrol n cash card fees. Wkend then cheong,btohqsg
weekday work Mac Donald . Sunday work llmüòÇ,btohqsg
Cos can imagine - those who are employed and gotta be back in office; also may not order IF other coworkers tarbao back.However those who have a slower pace of life and have the spare cash to pay for delivery  may still carry on.If anything  perhaps now onwards a larger portion of orders might be well  larger in volume (and weight),btohqsg
Really?Just go llm office there to collect? Need booking slot ?,btohqsg
You got yours tooDidn‚Äôt make any appointment - I happened to be in the area so I rode over. Waited a while  but ok la!100 dollar fuel voucher  although my motorcycle parking was 1.50! üòµ,btohqsg
In a way  by having more delivery folks signing up  LLM is also diversifying the number of delivery folks who can take up jobs when others can‚Äôt make it - from motivation (or lack thereof)  weather  personal schedules etcCan‚Äôt rely on it as a fulltime thingie.When SMM was in full force  people would probably rather send us to pick up and deliver food. Gut feel is that now those who should be at the workplace aren‚Äôt ordering like before - and might just makan with friends/colleagues or tarbao together.Personally I rather send items but not food.But for homeowners who need a vehicle to move stuff  that demand will be there - just a matter of how many of them.I‚Äôve enjoyed running a LLM job for a hearing aids company that a friend also works at - because I felt that I was earning while being a force multiplier for their business. Win-win  so they say. üôÇHowever this is an important time to really do the math  especially for 4 wheeled drivers. Because for motorbikes  the worst fuel consumption comes at about 15-20 kmpl. My own bike can occasionally touch 32 kmpl  and some even 40-50 kmpl.,btohqsg
We all need a backup plan,btohqsg
Customer late for pick up what to do? Any fee ?,btohqsg
Told me to wait another 5min,btohqsg
1st - 5mins free2nd - 5mins chat CS claim,btohqsg

Anyone happen to have lalakit bagBut bidding orders... yet state: require lalakit in order to take up that order,btohqsg
Hi ive been experiencing some problem with the app   few customer notified arrived way before i even reach the place .. chances are when i load photo when collecting they get notification that item is delivered,btohqsg
I did get one mcdelivery order from mcd loyang point,btohqsg
End up just now one customer say she wrote in to complain me because i key arrive .. i showed her my app havent key arrive and she apologise but she dont know how to undo complain,btohqsg
This good money those who work in office at raffles place,btohqsg
If the route is katong - pasir ris - farrer park - Robertson quay. Possible to deliver to farrer park Robertson  then tampines last?,btohqsg
I don't see any specific instructions say cannot change route,btohqsg
I was thinking is a bit weird cos the nearest from katong should be farrer then Robertson quay then tamp,btohqsg
But when you reach the place had to unload then get signature or pic.,btohqsg
So dunno if allow to change route anot,btohqsg
What happen when you change route,btohqsg
How to change route in the app,btohqsg
Taken after I posted here for 15mins,btohqsg
Always ask the customer when u pick up if you have to follow the route or can plan your own. Let them know that if u change route is faster or smoother etc. If customer say can go according to your plan then go ahd. Sometimes they plan all over maybe cos there is a certain time they need to deliver the item to certain location.,btohqsg
Not all multi stop can. U can see via the app. Whether there is a change next destination choice or not. If there isn't  but the customer let's u plan ur own route  u can still deliver according to where u want first,btohqsg
But make sure u don't exceed the time given for the delivery  and also if u stack don't overdo it. Customer give u free rein  but don't take advantage  then everything will be ok,btohqsg
Hmm actually will be faster to complete the whole order if deliver to the nearest addr and the furthest addr last,btohqsg
U make ur own call lor  depends on  individualüòä,btohqsg
Just make sure delivery done in time n proper. Even if stack don't stack too far away 1. Cos if customer track u  if not happy can complain then give u bad rating,btohqsg
How does this Change look like? I‚Äôve done a fair bit of multi stops but never seem to have found any,btohqsg
It's on top of the screen  just under the address of the next drop off pt,btohqsg
Nxt time if I ever do any i screenshot show uüòÇ,btohqsg
I pickup mac for lala a few time. Always is a few cartons. Haha. But one thing they good is they pack nicely for u.,btohqsg
Keep a lookout for the next promo/incentive lor,btohqsg
When Grab  Tada etc are too ex ü§£,btohqsg
some customers will ask you how do you know it weigh more than 20kg. cock right? haha,btohqsg
Yupyup. That time i pickup just 2 meals and 2 coffees only,btohqsg
that's y it will be good for llm to provide option for user to select whether trolley is needed. add convenient to the whole process.only drivers with trolley will pick up the job.,btohqsg
I do have a traveller‚Äôs handheld scale ;-),btohqsg
that's y. never state anything then when accepted job n arrived then say need trolley. lol,btohqsg
LLM Cs dont listen to u 1. They only side customer,btohqsg
Likewise if you have a genuine reason to cancel order,btohqsg
Sometime i dont take oddle order like pick up 10am etc Putian.  Than when u reach @ 10am putian will told u they open @ 11am,btohqsg
All of us will kena also. Sometime u pick-up aldy. U will still receive call asking have u pickup,btohqsg
They never communicate with each other,btohqsg
nowaday oddle so on. You sld ask for their contact.,btohqsg
haha sometime res call me also. I always ask them ur pick up is what time and which name.  Sometime when i pre book. They will call u v early to ask u ques.,btohqsg
huh why u say so ?,btohqsg
47mins from dempsey resto? Wah so jialat,btohqsg
I kena a few which made me wait 1 hour.,btohqsg
I got once kena almost 30mins from that resto then I nvr take their orders anymore,btohqsg
diao xiao  er i ever kena wait 1hr30min,btohqsg
1hr 30min u wait ah? King,btohqsg
Last job of the day liao. So i wait. But i keep kpkb to the res and claim from CS,btohqsg

Got 1 time i pick up  @ res in tiong bahru. I reach early n pick up early. Proceed send to a angmo landed house. He f me like nobody. Knn res told customer that i late.,btohqsg
Sometime u never do anything wrong. 1 complain ur rating goes down. LLM dont even ask u why.,btohqsg
It's very hard for rating to back to 5. Cos rhey take the last 40 rated jobs u took. U basically need to get 40 ratings of 5 then u will see ur rating at 5,btohqsg
I had to wait nearly a yr b4 I got back to 5 last last wk,btohqsg
Cos not all users will rate u,btohqsg
N oddle jobs mostly don't give rating,btohqsg
U need do alot of those non platform orders n get them to rate u 5,btohqsg
Not all 99 jobs will give u rating,btohqsg
Those jobs which don't give u rating will not be counted as part of ur last 40 jobs rated,btohqsg
Means u need have last 40 jobs which were rated 5 then u see 5. Any1 of them 1 then u take the full score n divide,btohqsg
Cos I did alot of oddle in the past. Only recent mths less oddle so got chance to get rated,btohqsg
Condo u need unload until siao,btohqsg
worst part u unload until siao and they dont ans ur intercom n phone call.,btohqsg

Scammers will die of Covid-19...not to worry if you aren't.,btohqsg
This one confirm must wait long. Picked up  order from them a couple of times. Min must wait 30 mins. One time  customer scolded me  she mentioned ordered at 9pm. I only delivered at 1am.üòú,btohqsg
Same  i think mine one time i rcv the next day. I go chase them. They write your paynow number on their log book. Very messy!,btohqsg
Omg drive for 9 hrs less than 100 dollars,btohqsg
Peak hours is really a nightmare,btohqsg
Hey guys  I‚Äôm new here. Would like to know where‚Äôs the best area I can start collecting my orders from? I stay in Pasir Ris btw,btohqsg
And excuse my lack of understanding but will I get more jobs if I were to standby myself at town as compared to waiting for orders in let‚Äôs say Simei,btohqsg
Does anyone knows what is information fee?,btohqsg
Llm is now no longer a cfm make good $ delivery job. Yes during covid was very good. U will have many jobs with good prices even on weekdays. Now that everything has opened up  it's definite that there will be much less orders  but the number of drivers have not dropped  but seems to be even more. Much smaller pie  much more mouths competing. And now with priority given to those cars with stickers  bikes with bags  it gets much more difficult for you to get the good value jobs.,btohqsg
Used to be fri-sun easy to get $200 onwards  even if not public holiday. Now  u have to really be very lucky.,btohqsg
And so my advice to all those newcomers  if you were attracted by all those llm ads about making good money etc  please get ready to be hit hard by the actual reality facing all the llm drivers/riders here.,btohqsg
Either u really drive alot and take alot of sucky priced orders  which will maybe let u hit $100-200 even on a wkday but in the long run with the high petrol cost ur profit margin is not gg to be that worth it based on time n effort put in  or u r just doing the job to maybe earn a little bit to cover petrol expenses. $100/day is still doable tbh.,btohqsg
The pre covid traffic is a very big factor. Used to have very very smooth traffic which helps in having more time to do more jobs stack. Also even if petrol price goes up but if traffic smooth u will still burn much less petrol. Now with the shit traffic  instead of maybe 10+ mins finishing 1 job  u may need up to 30mins just to finish 1 job order. Time n petrol burnt in jam means u really can't afford shit fares,btohqsg
This is really terrible I don't think it's worth to do this,btohqsg
The time and money u spend on parking and petrol and to send to the client door step,btohqsg
To each their own. Know what u want. If u feel that u can't do that or not worth it  then either find something else or adjust your expectations or the way you r working now lor,btohqsg
Really didn't expect this to be so tough,btohqsg
Hope everyone here can have a good weekend,btohqsg
Just know that current reality is not so smooth  economy is not rosy. Manage ur own expectations. If u want more  either find something better or put in even more effort. Nothing comes ez now,btohqsg
Yeah I guess this is just a last resort thingy,btohqsg
Delivery is self employed  no fixed income. Its always tough. Even when prices n jobs were much better  to get good income/day also need put in long hrs,btohqsg
Job only have 1  u have to bid against few driver for a good job. Those lousy job will b there but eventually ppl will take cos Lanlan. LLM name already say lan lan move,btohqsg

Eh please don‚Äôt pump 95 in Malaysia hor.I noted the big jump even for 97 yesterday from 3.91 to 4.31 RM per liter yday when I rode my bike in.,btohqsg
cos 97 is meant for Singaporean. jhk will pump 95,btohqsg
Eh. 97 is meant for non-Malaysian la.Thailand drivers also kena the same thing when going Malaysia la,btohqsg
What if you claim waiting time and there is no more live chat sia,btohqsg
All vehicles la. As long not Malaysian  don‚Äôt subject yourself and the gas station to trouble.After all  which gas station is gonna pump out whatever you pumped in  along with the possible bits of rust etc back into their tanks.,btohqsg
bike go in waste time ... full tank 10l?,btohqsg
Yup. Just incidental trips where I need to get small stuff for work or makan bits,btohqsg
What's the maximum weight for bike?,btohqsg
8kg. I just posted a screenshot a couple days back  also on LLM website,btohqsg
How come leh? How much did you carry?,btohqsg
Anyone encounter when you see an order it says immediate but when you got it it says pick up 30mins later?,btohqsg
Hi ppl if use llm discount for Caltex can we still pay by ocbc credit card,btohqsg
Can but still 22% lalamove discount,btohqsg
I just want to pay with cc,btohqsg
Cc got fuel rebate 3% to cc,btohqsg
Yup  I encountered that too. I‚Äôm not sure if the user able to adjust the pick up timing after they‚Äôve released the order.,btohqsg
Advanced jobs that are due to be picked up within 30 min will turn red (pick up now category) that's the problem,btohqsg
Just like some1 just pointed out  now scheduled orders due for pickup within 30mins time will turn into immediate pickup now (red) job. So its normal. Some restos  users may also throw out the job once they get the order  and as long as the state the pickup time in 30mins it becomes immediate(red) order.,btohqsg
A lot of llm users use that to advantage to not pay the demand surcharge,btohqsg
Assuming now it's 1432  they will book pick up time to be 1503 or 1504,btohqsg
"So itll appear as ""pick up now"" too",btohqsg
why do some orders have a heart shape,btohqsg
I think I prefer to deliver non food stuff. If I late at least won't get scolded,btohqsg
Hungry person is an angry person,btohqsg
Except that about 80% of the jobs are food delivery. Harder to earn if you avoid food delivery totally.,btohqsg
I read no commission don't know true or not,btohqsg
"""No commission"" model they take it off the vendor's side  like grabpandaroo. llm can easily show us a ""delivery fee"" without showing how much they are charging the vendor  which would make it look like ""no commission"" also.",btohqsg
No commission the platform will starve to death,btohqsg

Valentino I kena few times. Initially when I took last Yr was ok. Then slowly they will keep cancelling. Then I stop taking,btohqsg
By the time  job gone  bo liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
Actually quite easy de  good jobs will be gone before u blink eyes  fk type ones will stay waiting for suckers,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇnowdays good jobs I will always kena the lalabag/sticker msg  so I no chance get the good onesüòÇ,btohqsg
But also got good jobs nobody take  maybe is nobody near that pickup location,btohqsg
Or they already full liao so cannot takeüòÇ,btohqsg
Even with stickers n bag i also sometime see that,btohqsg
Oh u also will kena even if u have sticker?,btohqsg
Maybe my cancellation rate not good,btohqsg
I tot if u have sticker u still can complete the bid just depend on rating n distance,btohqsg
I got suggest customer to cancel or find other driver,btohqsg
For us no sticker  below will tell us leave the orderüòÇ,btohqsg
I got a feeling it's more of how close u are to the order,btohqsg
No need to write on the main chat which place etc good,btohqsg
Have u all come across Taste paradise order. If u got the job with tips. Please be aware. They usually book lalamove n another delivery platform to do their delivery order. So got 1 time i went. There was another driver collecting the same order. Then the manager said they also cancelled lalamove delivery. No choice i livechat with lalamove to get compensation. Today i took their order again. This time i was the only driver there. Before i left the manager ask me if i am from which platform.I wondering if is the case where they usually book 2 n see who comes first,btohqsg
Now I see alot of places last time always add money,btohqsg
Now don't need add money job gone,btohqsg
Cos got pple comment on chat where better to go,btohqsg
Yea bas tard sia  i kena once  but i bas tard them backüòÇ,btohqsg
Taste paradise is where. Actually I see 2 platforms doing this. Getz n the Chinese lettering one  the 1 which usually do for 313 sommerset Tanyu. Getz is the recent platform using llm. Even after u get their job  u have to be careful n monitor the job app. Sometimes they will either throw out another same order  but using bike if urs was car. Cheaper option. Will remain open all the way until u pick up ur order. If b4 that the cheaper option taken ur order is cancelled,btohqsg
The Chinese lettering 1 also do the same. There was 1 day  they had a few jobs at different restis at same time. They 1 time shoot out +20 or something. My friend took. Awhile later all cancelled,btohqsg
Then the come out job again,btohqsg
The 1 I kena. I reach there early. Told the resto. He check say cfm  say still preparing. I say ok cos I early. Then halfway thru. My job cancelled. I ask the resto  they say they nvr cancel. Then they go check  become another driver. Then llm call me. Say their customer  which is the platform  cancel my job. Wtf lor,btohqsg
Then the driver came  I check his job much much cheaper. Mine was +20  his was +2ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
That's y these type  now I can't b bothered to take liao,btohqsg
Yes  I call back the llm person. Demand the 50%. Then when they give me  it was without the +20. I say cannot. Must give me the 50% of full sum. To n fro few times then I got it.,btohqsg
Hit n miss. Sometimes can get sometimes cannot. See ur heng suay,btohqsg
Not the CS ganna sia. Some can come in. Before i can type they left,btohqsg
Then we are stuck as we no longer can type in live chat or even start a new one,btohqsg
When u want claim. Just go in livechat n type out what u want say. Then screenshot. Then when got time go in n check. Write what happen n say u want claim the fee. If the Cs come in no do anytg then leave  u can either start a new one or email llm. With the screenshot as proof that u already went thru cs but they don't so shit,btohqsg
Getz touches base w gogox also,btohqsg
That's why out of nowhere can get cancelled,btohqsg
Then these platforms always put on their remarks no need to call resto to confirm. I would say it‚Äôs a trick cos in case of double booking/cancellation llm will not compensate u if no call confirmation done. Regardless  i still call. Most of the time  they dont pick up the call.,btohqsg
Delivery Chinatown so far ok. In fact the last time they cancelled my order they called me very fast b4/after they cancel n apologise to me.,btohqsg
But take note was using a private number which I norm don't answer üòÇ,btohqsg
Getz n ÁîüÈ≤úÈ£üÂìÅ can't even b bothered to let us know,btohqsg
The 1 they cancelled was an order that had been left on the llm job app for a long time liao. Apparently was already picked up but wasn't cancelled in the app,btohqsg
Chinatown has so far been the better platform for me. They had a couple of times msg me asking how long I will take for pickup. After letting them know  they acknowledged and told me to drive safe. Did not rush me but guess cos I not that far when I took the job. And at least they have the decency to call me n let me know job cancelled n sorry. None of the other platforms bother to even inform me,btohqsg
Ok enough of my old man talesüòÇ,btohqsg
Many previous order require lalabagRecently bought the lalabagSlide the order yet still prompt you need lalabag.....ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Yah was thinkg of buying. Lucky no buy also,btohqsg
Yup I heard n saw b4 their fee low. So just like u take the spill over orders.,btohqsg

Resturant late 20mins to give me  now become my problem:(,btohqsg
If its ur old chat still there  just restart ur app n it shld b cleared. If its Cs not responding  I wrote b4. Just go in livechat tell them restaurant late. Once food passed to you tell them in the livechat again what time u got the food  tell them add the late fee and also put a note that its restaurant late n not u late. Then screenshot everything. Don't need wait there for Cs to reply. Carry on your job as per normal. Cs shld auto do for u once they see. If not u can claim after. As long as have screenshot proof u don't need scared lah,btohqsg

Waiting 1.5hr  very bad orders management  noticed they cooked for those that went there and dabao 1st  then left those LLM and grab orders waiting,btohqsg
Shld have just cancel the job,btohqsg
I cannot believe you can wait until 1.5 hours. One can complete 2 to 3 jobs for that amount of time.,btohqsg
Just swipe arrive and take pictures and cancel after waiting for 20 mins. 10 min is grace period and another 10 mins that it,btohqsg
How to cancel when cannot get any agents,btohqsg
Actually after waiting for 20mins I went out buy my dinner  came back still not ready.,btohqsg
Customer also appreciated my long wait and tipped me,btohqsg
I drove 4 hours today. Only make about 50,btohqsg
And this is with holiday surcharge,btohqsg
My fuel cost around half that,btohqsg
What time did u start? There were fair amount of jobs in the first half morning but from 2pm onwards almost none and majority of the jobs went to those with stickers,btohqsg
I started at 8am and my earnings were $158 at 1pm. Then nothing all the way until 4.30pm one job and 2 dinner jobs that it with total $235 for 12 hours work.,btohqsg
Yesterday I did only 4+ hours and earnings were $200,btohqsg
How many jobs did you take from 8-1pm?,btohqsg
Wow u managed get all the good priced jobs ah? I ytd keep losing bids to stickers,btohqsg
Tdy whole day also either lose bid or job appear I press then gone liao,btohqsg
Lucky lah. I took 2 morning scheduled jobs in between so easier to plan,btohqsg
Me too from 2 to 4pm lost bid,btohqsg
Lose to sticker I bor bian,btohqsg
Mine was ok one was $25 and the other $22.50,btohqsg
"Wat I don't understand is when I click on the job when it just appear in my app then it says ""driver full"" or order taken",btohqsg
Dunno if it's my hp or what. But then tdy keep happening,btohqsg
I can't even bid  don't say lose to sticker,btohqsg
Because we have no sticker. Quota full as max 3 drivers only can take,btohqsg
Does sticker affect when job appears in app?,btohqsg
They get to see the job before us so by the time we go in  taken liao by others,btohqsg
Means we see the job later than sticker?,btohqsg
They always say ppl with sticker will have priority in jobs,btohqsg
So they get to see first,btohqsg
Want to get more jobs put sticker.,btohqsg
