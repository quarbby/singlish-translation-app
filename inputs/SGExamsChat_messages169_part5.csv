Basically E math in short everyone is getting A1.,btohqsg
if its less than 25% A1 it might be jus 75 for a1 lor,btohqsg
Paper was quite easy compared to other years,btohqsg
E math need get somewhere close to very high 80 or 90+ for A1.,btohqsg
Basically paper 1 do well is the A1 ones that's what my teacher told me before!,btohqsg
so if paper 1 like cmi for anyone then can kiss bye to A1.,btohqsg
topics that may come out as big topics in paper 2- coordinate geometry- matrices- mensuration- congruence and similarity- circle properties- graph and functions,btohqsg
so if my math around 55% then i fail alr?,btohqsg
real world problems are the concepts we learnt,btohqsg
sometimes if they kind they put passing mark at 45-50?,btohqsg
prwc will not go off the syllabus,btohqsg
idt vectors will be a lot of marks in paper 2 tho,btohqsg
math impt theyll try to help u honestly,btohqsg
but if A1 they will make it harder,btohqsg
i did like my sec 3 el compre,btohqsg
my paper 1 i estimated 45/73  but i scared paper 2 i flunk. people keep saying paper 1 very easy then paper 2 die for sure,btohqsg
paper 2 is jus the stupid rwc thats disgusting,btohqsg
ofhers may be much more straightforward,btohqsg
dont forget to annotate for prwc,btohqsg
I mean emaths is considered simple if careful,btohqsg
And my emaths all along in sec sch was quite bad,btohqsg
topics that may come out as big topics in paper 2- coordinate geometry- matrices- mensuration- congruence and similarity- circle properties- trigo and bearings- sector and segments- inequality-,btohqsg
emath prwc demolishes my hopes for A1,btohqsg
the stupid polygon alr demolished half of my marbles,btohqsg
sector and segments are part of mensuration,btohqsg
topics that may come out as big topics in paper 2- coordinate geometry- matrices- mensuration- congruence and similarity- circle properties- trigo and bearings- inequalities- graphs and functions,btohqsg
there may be a quadratic eqn word problem,btohqsg
Go see the tys and the percentage of certain topics in both 1 and 2 then work from there to see if the topics will reappear,btohqsg
uh standard form they usually throw inside paper 1,btohqsg
this time standard form dh in p1 ah,btohqsg
They just call it something else. But for all purposes of understanding  it exists.,btohqsg
idk how to replace the words leh,btohqsg
try not to send here next time u gotta send study grp,btohqsg
bruh so if paper 1 was very easy then passing mark also get pulled along with distinction mark? so like to pass is 60?!,btohqsg
oh i replied at her eh,btohqsg
I fuck up the qns 3,btohqsg
same passing mark gonna be 60%,btohqsg
based off five years of my sec sch life teachers have been telling us that the papers we do will be hard to fail and hard to get A1,btohqsg
"and if you'd think you did ""badly"" for p1 just work a little hard for paper 2",btohqsg
Well this was what they did for o level in 2019 and before unless if you meant that this year onwards is special,btohqsg
bell curve is based on performance of students? then grade boundary is pre set along with the paper?,btohqsg
Relax go in try very hard and repeat the next day!,btohqsg
Guys the past is the past,btohqsg
No point u go bother liao,btohqsg
Later affect ur tmr el paper,btohqsg
don't wanna go back and forth about this just focus next paper,btohqsg
Why worry now in this chat the time spent thinking needs to be spent on the next paper,btohqsg
go prepare for the next paper no point being scared,btohqsg
Like I bomb my physics O level last year I also don't care,btohqsg
i really suggest you should stop worrying too much about it use the energy for tomorrow's paper,btohqsg
