Then they minus 2 marks or so i think,btohqsg
Eh so is it male geese or geese,btohqsg
If their asking for what type of animal,btohqsg
it's fine i think cambridge won't mark like those oldass english teachers,btohqsg
But different species of male geese,btohqsg

so ur writing an email to yourself,btohqsg
By me to aunt and uncle,btohqsg

At least in my format sheet,btohqsg
it depends for diff sch lol,btohqsg
When you write an actual email  you don't need to write the date lol.,btohqsg

At the end of the email^,btohqsg

Our sch provide us each with carrier pigeon,btohqsg
We need write with fountain pen,btohqsg

I put gender only for the explanation part and animal I only wrote geese. I think the animal column don‚Äôt specify gender should be fine but explanation column need,btohqsg
a male geese is called a gander,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt include date according to my school need date,btohqsg
Shit  I didn't sign off üò∞,btohqsg
Anyway if u don‚Äôt write I guess they wouldn‚Äôt really bother,btohqsg
my sch format no from tho,btohqsg
Hmm that one is more important than date so they might very well penalise,btohqsg
no date is okay but no sign off cannot,btohqsg
can just say ur loving nephew rite,btohqsg
Not necessarily I guess maybe they just move you one band lower for the format section of the rubric so if the other criteria you fulfilled it well the format might not pull you down luckily,btohqsg
What if your uncle and aunty don‚Äôt think you love them,btohqsg
Whats the answer for the phrase one,btohqsg
I put 'my tutor was impressed' ;_;,btohqsg
I put ‚Äúrefer to pratical..... assignment. ‚Äù,btohqsg

How bout the one abt the contrast,btohqsg
One was comfortable and the other not comfortable. Idk I'm dumb,btohqsg
How was the paper was it manageable or was it a bit tricky?,btohqsg
Wats the answer for the uh Mrs morton thinking she went into the wrong room,btohqsg
Its like easy and some straightforward but then if the qs straightforward like fishy liek thay,btohqsg
She went to parts of the library that were intended for more mature audiences,btohqsg
I said she wanted to read books for ages older than her  is that ok?,btohqsg
Frankly my answer is probably wrong anyway,btohqsg
i wrote bc the childrens room had books suitable for 10 year olds but grace did not stay inside and went to the same section as mrs morton,btohqsg
I‚Äôm q confident that‚Äôs it‚Äôs because she was 10 yr old and thus Mrs Morton expected her to stay at d childrens section but she wanted to learn more than what d children‚Äôs section could teach her,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why she went non fic,btohqsg
Tomorrow what paper is being tested?,btohqsg
