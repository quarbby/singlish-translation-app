i think i may have health issues as a result of too many meals skipped,btohqsg
im confused why if the PPC only shifts one way  then why the widget can produce more ah,btohqsg
coz zero emission only affect the production of clean env,btohqsg
man mei mei btr get it sorted out or smth,btohqsg
my mom says my period irregular cause of my healthy lifestyle,btohqsg
ig you can always get a body checkup nowadays ykwim blood test and shit  ,btohqsg
but idk leh if they allow uh teens to do do that without adults consent those stuff,btohqsg
how irregular is irregular. i got a fren her one come every few mths,btohqsg
and then right it lasts for like less then 5 days,btohqsg
If there with the pivoted shift on the diagram I thought it meant that in order to ‚Äúproduce‚Äù (idk what phrasing to use) one more unit of cleaning the environment they would need to give up fewer units widgets? Like with the opportunity cost of cleaning the environment has been reduced. Can see it on the diagram if you draw it. But max amount of widgets that can be produced hasn‚Äôt increased  just that with a given amount of cleaning envt/emissions reductions produced  more widgets can still be produced with the remaining resources.,btohqsg
The qn says ‚Äúrelative to what it was making previously‚Äù  and it did not say all resources were devoted to making widgets previously,btohqsg
What do you usually eat in a day lol?,btohqsg

Uk u need to at least put in some effort,btohqsg

I see  probably cus chatgpt is not finetuned for our syllabus right,btohqsg
I feel it may b quite useful if it becomes more accurate with more info on our questions and syllabus,btohqsg
considering that chatgpt failed psle  i have ntg to say,btohqsg
Depends what kind of qns are u asking,btohqsg
If u ask maths and physics/chem qns chances if chatgpt getting it correct is higher,btohqsg
And can use it to finetune ur english,btohqsg
Somebody struck this on the wall in the toilet at NTU,btohqsg
Grammly and chatgpt helps alot to improve ur eng,btohqsg
