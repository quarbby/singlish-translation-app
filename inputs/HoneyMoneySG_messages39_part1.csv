I‚Äôm interested to sign up CIMB credit card through Singsaver for the $330 upsized cashback but this flash deal is expiring on 2 April 2023. I wonder if I‚Äôm still able to get the cashback if I submit the online application on the last day. Anyone tried before? Should I apply today? Thanks.,btohqsg
Yea it‚Äôs a sign that the card approved  you will need this number to sign up for online banking account for your credit cardCIMB doesn‚Äôt send email/SMS to say your credit card approved. My guess is you will see the physical card in a mail soon enufCheers,btohqsg
yes and use Amaze card for transactions that is not excluded as per TnC of citi rewards,btohqsg
Yes  apply before tonight 23:59H is still eligiblehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/80238,btohqsg

Just a note. Need to be patient for their sign up rewards to be credited. I signed up in Oct  met the min spent in Nov. Got the sign up rewards only in Mar.,btohqsg
Hi all  I just signed up the following credit cards through Singsaver and got approved lately.OCBC Titanium Rewards $228 CashMin spend $500 within 30 daysCiti Rewards $300 CashMin spend $500 within 30 daysCIMB Visa Signature $330 CashMin spend $988 within 60 daysBut then I realised that I need to spend $1500 in order to get the cashback. I usually spend only $500 a month and I find it difficult for me to spend another $1000. Is there any tips to meet the min spend for each card? Is topping up to FairPrice Gift Card and advance bill payment to Telco (Singtel app/online) considered as eligible spend for these cards? Thanks in advance! üôè,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. Time to churn and get the 330 CB reward üôè,btohqsg
It not advisable to sign many cards in the same month. Anyway since done just top up FairPrice gift card,btohqsg
Yea agree with above ^ Citi bank (seen higher rewards) and CIMB rewards quite frequent also  dunnid sign nowSince sign alrd  FairPrice lorAdvance payment to telco should be not eligible spend,btohqsg
Initially I thought that some of my credit card applications will rejected by the bank so I went to apply all at once to try my luck. But then I didn‚Äôt know all got approved. üòÖ,btohqsg
Can I use all 3 of these cards to top up FairPrice Gift Card and eligible for cashback? Or some can some cannot? Is there any other ways or strategies beside FairPrice?,btohqsg
See Chris video here please for your last questionhttps://youtu.be/7HRtDzj4_4QI not sure how the top up works  but if u buy voucher at FairPrice should be considered groceries spending also which is eligible spend  also covered in Chris‚Äô video,btohqsg
Ok  I will watch it later. Thanks for sharing the link!,btohqsg
Wah so many at 1 go.Gotta watch and track the spendings to hit the minimum spend,btohqsg
Does Spotify monthly subscription give Citi points for CRMC when linked to amaze?,btohqsg

Any good all round cashback card to recommend?Current have these  not sure is it the best available in term of higher cashback..Ocbc FrankSC unlimited (simply cash)SC spreeCiti Cashback plusAmex tcbMostly use inOnline shopping (shopee  redmart  steam)Grocery (ntuc)Shopping in storeGrab rideGrab food,btohqsg
Uob one. Citi cashback [or can omit and just buy fairprice voucher at carousell. Now standard rates at 8% discount],btohqsg
I got this as well. There was abit of hiccups but mine was approved within 5 work days or so,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wise to go all out at once. Doing CIMB only  and once attain minimum spend target  see if there any promos from Maybank / BOC? Let‚Äôs see üôè,btohqsg
depends how much you can spend ? can consider maybank barcelona too,btohqsg
Is SC spree 2% online/mobile Cashback suppose to be good or have other tnc?,btohqsg
Bought too much fairprice voucher. If anyone wanting to buy at 8%discount . Stay in the east. Can msg me.,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs better to split the cashback credit cards into min spend and no min spend. For example  let‚Äôs say your OCBC Frank CC  you must spend at least $800 a month to get up to 8~10% cashback for selected categories/merchants  or else you will only get flat 0.3% cashback. If you can‚Äôt hit the min spend  then might as well to use other credit cards that give you 1.5~2% cashback with no min spend for your daily expenses.,btohqsg
Does this mean cards like UOB absolute (amex) cannot use on Apple Pay?,btohqsg
Yes. Only AMEX issued AMEX cards can.,btohqsg
Hi guys  for using HSBC EGA to pay for income tax for the 1% GIRO cashback  does that mean if one chooses monthly instalment  one need to generally do the 2k in  5 trx out  in all 12 months  to qualify for the full 1% across the 12 monthly payments in GIRO?,btohqsg
Technically  you need to do it every alternate month. But if you are lazy in remembering which months you need to do  then just do it every month,btohqsg
is there a reason why alternate month is enough? Or do you mean 2k in on odd month and 2k out on even month?,btohqsg
Because each everyday+ eligibility typically is valid for 2 months. If you receive the eligibility sms today  it's valid to the end of the following month.,btohqsg
no need 2K out  can just FAST out 5 x $1 also ok,btohqsg
Oh cool  didn‚Äôt know there‚Äôs an SMS for these things  looks like a good feedback mechanism,btohqsg
Does the 1% from GIRO come in the following month?,btohqsg
the question is how to use this card to pay income tax?,btohqsg
Hi gurus any idea what‚Äôs the best way to pay for hawker QR to maximise CC benefits?,btohqsg
Citi Rewards + FavePay still gives 4mpd even on foodcourt/hawker/coffeeshop food?,btohqsg
Yes  just make sure you link your Citi Rewards card to FavePay directly  not through Apple Pay,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing too! But not all hawkers have fav pay üò¢,btohqsg
Liquid pay used to be my go to until they only use the PayNow function üò™,btohqsg
