Anyway need MOP over then can buy condo,btohqsg
No such ruling. Once your MOP is over  you can do either.,btohqsg
"""If you are thinking of doing so  you must meet all of HDB's eligibility conditions such as its 5-year Minimum Occupation Period (MOP)  non-citizen quota for renting out your flat and so on. You can refer to HDB's link here:https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/renting-out-a-flat-bedroom/renting-out-your-flatDo note that owners of resale HDB flats purchased from the open market without a CPF Housing Grant and who have occupied their flats for at least 3 years are allowed to sublet their whole flat. Owners of HDB flats purchased directly from HDB or the open market with CPF Housing Grant and who have occupied their flats fr at least 5 years are allowed to sublet their whole flat.""",btohqsg
This reply from the pguru website i quoted.,btohqsg
That '3 yrs can sublet whole flat' part is NEW to me!!!!,btohqsg

a bit misleading they way they phrase it.,btohqsg
ish maciam no need mop5 yrs  3 yrs can sublet whole unit as long no cpf grant and bought from open mkt.,btohqsg
CitizenshipOnly Singapore Citizens are allowed to rent out the HDB flat. Singapore Permanent Resident flat owners are not allowed to do so.Minimum Occupation Period (MOP)You can rent out your flat after fulfilling the 5-year MOP. If your flat is non-subsidised (purchased from the open market without a housing grant) and purchased before 30 August 2010  the MOP is 3 years.,btohqsg
I think this one clears doubts.,btohqsg
Just take it as 5years MOP now  because the 3 years only applies if you bought from more than ten years ago and without subsidy.,btohqsg
So mean non-citizenship owner are not allow to rent flat even after MOP?,btohqsg
I think that is quite clear,btohqsg
Don't think directly facing the sea,btohqsg

hi sorry l  can i just consult  for the fiancé and fiancée scheme  both names must be in applicant or can be 1 applicant but the other as occupier?,btohqsg
Can be 1 applicant 1 occupier,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  applicant = future BTO owner  occupier will not be considered the flat owner (all the ABSD rubbish down the road). I'm in a similar situation as well  from what I understand  grants calculation use both applicant and occupier but will only be credited to the applicant CPF (in the case of co-owner  will split 50-50).For HLE and all CPF payment  can only use the applicant/owner's income and CPF  the occupier can only support with cash and not CPF.,btohqsg
So HDB loan monthly repayment also only come from owner's CPF  the occupier cannot use his/her CPF to help.,btohqsg
Yes  unfortunately need the owner to understand that his/her CPF OA will likely be wiped out  with the option of retaining up to $20 000.,btohqsg
Grants calculation use both applicant and occupier  thought only the applicant/s,btohqsg
Both (at least for essential occupier). If you put child as additional occupier then I'm not sure,btohqsg
