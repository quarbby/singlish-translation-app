May I ask what is the validity for  Krisflyer Elite Miles? If I can't meet the Elite Miles Required by date  does it mean all Elite Miles earned would be reset to zero üòÇ,btohqsg
Thanks! Using this as example. Does it mean the entire 5243 Elite miles would be gone on 1 Nov or the Elite Miles that has hit 12 months validity?,btohqsg
Gone on 1 nov. It is within a fixed 12 month period based on when u sign up krisflyer acct i think,btohqsg
That's unfair. Of which  the 1800 Elite Miles were earned only two days ago. Does it mean it would gone on 1 Nov as well?,btohqsg
Nothing unfair of it  sia set the tnc,btohqsg
U dont like it then dont join  it is like bank set the cc rewards rule too.,btohqsg
If u agree to tnc upon joining then just play by the rules,btohqsg
No  they miles willl expire 12months based on your earned date,btohqsg
Any idea which is the best card to use? üôè,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
Wow! That‚Äôs fast! Thank you üôè,btohqsg
Thanks! I'm hearing two different interpretion. Validity based on 12  months after the earned date of Elite Miles or 'Required By' date . So which is the right interpretation?,btohqsg
Hi  with both Amex code in cardup fully redeemed  does it mean I have to pay with other cards or still can use Amex but at 2.6%?,btohqsg
It doesn‚Äôt talk about which cc to use for card up. I am getting quite confused‚Ä¶.Anyway  thanks‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I have been a frequent flyer with SQ and based on my experience my miles expire based on earned date  you may choose which interpretion to listen to at your own discretion :),btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. Appreciate it much. I just ended a call with SIA.Based on Section G Clause 1d  I am afraid the Elite miles would be reset to zero if cannot meet the 'Required By' date.https://www.singaporeair.com/en_UK/sg/ppsclub-krisflyer/termsconditions-kf/,btohqsg
