🎉Pika World Daily Review – 4 Oct 2022🎉🍟Equity market stable after a rocky past quarter🕹Stock market remains firmer after it suffered major months as bond yields retreated.It has also been a dark period for bonds holders as prices fall with rising yields.A sense of relief was seen as pressure was off given a more risk on sentiment. The swing in the market arises as participants adjust their expectation on the pace of rake hikes and how long such cycles tend to last.🎤Two-Year Bond Yield moderating🚑The yield is often seen as a measure of investors’ expectation of where the Fed’s fund rate will hold. Current level is for it to hit 4.1% after hitting a high of 4.3%💎UK back track gives new light💎The UK chancellor has pulled back plan to reduce to cut tax rates for high earners.It was part of a broader spending plan which would spur demand and exacerbate the cycles of inflation.The spending was not within the limit of the government’s coffer  and thus any borrowing ignite fear of aggressive spending that push up Glit yield further weakening the fiscal strength.📮What's on the menu today?📖At 9pm  FOMC member Williams will speak and 15 minutes later  Mester will deliver her speech too.Factory order will be released at 10pm and we expects a growth of 0.3% compare to a decline of 1.0% in the prior period .The biggest highlight comes at 10pm when we will receive the JOLTs Job Opening will moderate to 10.77M compared to 11.239M in the previous period.It is 4 October  Tuesday  at 1.15 pm in Singapore and 1.15 am in New York. It has been a splendid start of the week and Pika World wishes all friends a profitable week ahead!,btohqsg
