I tried his car one time  pretty shiok I feel,btohqsg
Ahhh  then probably easier for you to get out of the rear passenger cabin,btohqsg
Very rare sight. RHD C3 corvette,btohqsg
Who goes on a report war ah?,btohqsg
hello  i'm looking at 2nd hand around 5 years old  12k to 14k dep  specifically at civic  cerato  altis  avante. In terms of FC  how do you rank them? thanks.,btohqsg
Toyota Corolla AltisHonda CivicHyundai AvanteKia Cerato,btohqsg
Just rank ur feet. Your FC is proportionate to your right feet. Considering all is 1.6NA  u shud see their laden weight also. Avante and Cerato same engine(correct me if im wrong) so is the same. Internal features would be similar depending on spec. Drove both before. Pleasant to drive.,btohqsg
Sergeant Bed calling me to sleep,btohqsg
Get Avante CN7 instead  not Avante (Elantra AD facelift). FC should be the best for non hybrid 1.6NA.,btohqsg
Sexy car but the N version not in SG,btohqsg
Pui. Need 2.0 4 cylinder ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Hear the exhaust go POP POP POP,btohqsg
U want what sound also have,btohqsg
Speaker wonâ€™t even give that kind of sound la,btohqsg
A lot of things U dunno yet,btohqsg
Want to make cherry QQ sound like Aventador also can,btohqsg
Can Kia bring the new picanto 1.2a 2021?,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s everyone thoughts about Kia? And comparing with Hyundai. Tia.,btohqsg
hyundai more premium feel to it... but everything else almost identical,btohqsg
just choose whichever looks nicer to you... or go test drive and pick whichever drivers nicer,btohqsg
Some say Kia unreliable. Thats what I heard. But I feel in general both brands give better interior and more luxury like venti seats etc if compared with Toyota.,btohqsg
Also with platform-sharing between Kia and Hyundai  quality and ride would've improved a lot after all these years. Like the Ioniq 5 and EV6  and Palisade and Telluride (which we don't get).,btohqsg
Maybe this is possible since Hyundai had already established the luxury brand  Genesis  in North America  allowing them to pass down some luxurious quality to their more affordable counterparts? Maybe?,btohqsg
Both r good budget grocery cars,btohqsg
No 1 pick altis: (good head room  very big boot space can put 2 golf bag in no issue  reliable in FC  low maintenance),btohqsg
Avante CN7 does all this but better,btohqsg
Hyundai and Kia has improved lots as compared to a decade ago.,btohqsg
Wah i really love the cn7,btohqsg
Me too  really value for money and yet a drivers car,btohqsg
Steering input is accurate  sequential gear also responsive. Only downside is 1.6L but it suits the car well,btohqsg
I feel like itâ€™s already enough for your average singaporean,btohqsg
Same engines same drivetrain. Kia focuses on more sporty looks  hyundai is more on comfort,btohqsg
Changing bmw x5 3.0t to Porsche Macan 2.0t pdk is upgrade or downgrade? Same year.,btohqsg
Both just a normal grocery getter,btohqsg
Bro actually tbh right civic is rubbish,btohqsg
I think youâ€™re the only one who thinks that ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I see RR go market also,btohqsg
ur logic got error. I suspect ur math not good also. Car go mkt does not mean it only can be a mkt car.,btohqsg
Who said anything about thinking ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
See which one pleases ur eye,btohqsg
Drove both before. Feels the same. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£interior wise is the only difference,btohqsg
Both is good so is really up to u which one u prefer more,btohqsg
But hor given their price point,btohqsg
Ur arf is only 10k upon scrap,btohqsg
Oh no now cerato no more? Dont see it on sgcm listing,btohqsg
hope its a nice facelift or smth,btohqsg
New K4 coming to replace cerato,btohqsg
The front end looks pretty nice though,btohqsg
Ask them to bring K8 leh,btohqsg
But the rear end.. is a bit.. depends on the person I feel.,btohqsg
