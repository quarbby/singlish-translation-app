Use Evo to pay online for utilities like geneco and SP and cashback ?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  appreciate anyone can share on earning 4mpd for citi rewards card for Atome ?1. Use citi rewards to pay2. Pair with Amaze card to pay,btohqsg
Hi guys  noob question here  if I will like to apply for this months SSB allocation  will it be possible to apply under two different allocation for two different amounts or must i lump all of the amount into one single application?,btohqsg
Hi guys Any cards to recommend for points / miles for health screening purposes?,btohqsg
If you do that  you have to pay 2 times transaction fee. Eventually  the allocations would probably combined into one. When you want to sell  you can specify any amount from the total allocation.,btohqsg
With Kris + even better I guess ?,btohqsg
If you can  of course better ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Hello! I recently used Citi rewards card to pay manually all my telco bills (singtel for phone  m1 for broadband) and noticed I didnâ€™t get the bonus points. So I called in to check and they said bills are considered an exclusion.I used to think recurring bills are exclusion only  rather than manual bill payments. Anyone had the same experience recently?,btohqsg
Does Kris+ work with CRMC? Since it uses in app Apple Pay?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if Foodpanda payment via Apple Pay is considered online spend or contactless spend? TIA!,btohqsg
yes  considers as online because of Amaze,btohqsg
Is the HSBC Premier Master Credit Card good?,btohqsg
It's meh. You can get 8% on the same categories with Maybank F&F and Citi Cash Back,btohqsg
Question regarding stash account:If I put in 100k in it now  will I get 3% for the month of march?Or will it be best for me to put in the funds on 1st April?,btohqsg
No  it's not eligible for 10X. Apple Pay doesn't support Amaze,btohqsg
Yes it does but you will not get 10x rewards points because it is paid from a mobile wallet,btohqsg
Even though the category that you spend on is not in the excluded ones,btohqsg
Ya thatâ€™s what I assumed. I think only dbs womanâ€™s world will qualify due to the in app Apple Pay method required,btohqsg
Anyone happen to know the mcc for easybook?,btohqsg
For UOB ONE account 100k  when we will receive the interest? Would it be one or two transactions?,btohqsg
If I use HSBC rev with ShopBack  can I still earn 4miles?,btohqsg
"Question  when the tip is to use less than 30% of credit limit  does that mean we should pay off and ""leave"" about 30% or less upon release of statement? Then pay off the remaining after release? Cheers!",btohqsg
confirm can bot get 10x reward,btohqsg
confirm CRMC can get 10x reward when pay singtel and starhub bill in app.,btohqsg
Ok. My M1 and My republic bill when I called it was shot back for broadband. Singtel is still pending in the app after I paid but the customer service person say also excluding. Will see if itâ€™s true after itâ€™s actually transacted. Thanks.,btohqsg
Telco App. Specifically for m1 broadband as an example. I still purposely remove card just to try it,btohqsg
so u got 1x point but no 9x point?,btohqsg
Hmm I didnâ€™t ask so specific. But basically my balance now is say 850 dollars but my points is only about 7.6k clocked. So I called in to check which transaction didnâ€™t yield the 10x point  and they said the two lines of telco bills  one being M1 made via app.M1 I also recalled if you do recurring the bill will reflect recurring so this one that I did donâ€™t have that recurring word so Iâ€™m also sure itâ€™s not due to recurring.Should I call back to ask this specifically? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
check the points awarded daily on citi rewards website.https://www.citirewards.com/cms/sites/globalrewards-sg-eng/index.pagebtw you got wait like 2 working days after transaction posted?,btohqsg
if really want to ask cso  ask them for the mcc and whether it is online/recurring,btohqsg
Actually maybe youâ€™re right. And maybe the CSO is blur. Cause I recently used to also sign MyRepublic broadband. Then now you mention to track back. My m1 bill was 40  and I see a points that clocked +40 and 369 respectively. Which means likely it wen through. But maybe the MyRepublic was not counted because it was meant to be a deposit. So maybe that was not qualified despite being a telco mcc.If so then I hope MyRepublic will be considered as online telco spending then!So probably the CSO blur cause she tell me the m1 bill also never clock. I have a pending singtel bill to verify eventually.Thanks for the detailed tip. Appreciate it!,btohqsg
What brokers do yall use for sg stocks?,btohqsg
