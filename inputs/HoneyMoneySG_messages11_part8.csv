Thank you and not much choice also,btohqsg
If a bank would pay me to buy a 'List A' ETF near/at its historical low  I think it's a no-brainer offer to take up.If there could be more choices  what would you recommend that's better or equal?,btohqsg
Sorry I dont have any recommendations. I only know STI,btohqsg
Whats the incentive to double the investment above posb cashback limit,btohqsg
Who got ji pay and big pay referfal code to share?,btohqsg
I want to be very transparent about this. Another reason for selling is because I'm no longer dca-ing into syfe wealth. My syfe trade is already much larger than syfe wealth + accumulating monthly. So i dont need Syfe wealth anymoreNot easy sharing such stuff online because people hate bears/selling outs  so definitely will expect hate comments from the publicAll in all  I'm just sharing what im doing and not telling anyone to follow like i always put in disclaimers. But ya  you can't please everyone,btohqsg
"Apart from the upfront gifts above  there might not be further incentives doubling STI  though it's still arguably a better investment than SYFE.If it's ""doubled"" by investing into the bond ETFs  the 0.5% sales charges still beat SYFE's 0.65%.If CFA  it's purely taking advantage of its current lows  and not missing out by limiting oneself to the $30 cashback cap.",btohqsg
Oh ji pay no free top up fee?,btohqsg
Big pay if u use grab pay top up got fee ?,btohqsg
got banned becauae they couldnt match my ID to my selfie  customer service didnt do anything to resolve also,btohqsg
In case anyone is thinking of gaming Revolut.I've had funds of $4000 frozen inside for 5 months because they thought I was gaming the system trying to fund stock brokers. So  don't do it,btohqsg
What did you do to game it haha,btohqsg
"Guys  thanks for all the hacks! but may a question regarding Apple Pay with HSBC revolution card I and not able to use it for taking buses and MRT without FaceID and double clicking on the the iPhone  even when i had setup to have it in ""travel express"" mode. anyone know how to fix this issue ? sorry i think it is a little ""off topic"" but i have having lots of issues with it",btohqsg
I'm afriad there's no other way,btohqsg
travel express doesn't work in sg,btohqsg
I'm thinking of signing up for DBS Altitude credit card to get free airport lounge access. Wondering if it's easy to get the annual fees waived?,btohqsg
Apple express mode don't work in SG,btohqsg
U still need to unlock before tapOnly Samsung can tap without unlock,btohqsg
Ok sad and thanks for the answers ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
If u don't wanan tap and unlockGet apple watche,btohqsg
Easy  as long as there is spending on other dbs cards,btohqsg
I only spend $1 to fulfill the Multiplier criteria though,btohqsg
Just cancel if they dont waive,btohqsg
don't think card cancellation affect credit ü§î (i might be wrong tho),btohqsg
IMHO the credit issue works as followsYou have an outstanding charge  billed. ( annual fee)You haggle with customer service and then cancel card without paying. The bank report a missed payment.The credit rating go low.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  what‚Äôs the best card to use for insurance premium payment? I saw that Maybank horizon visa has 0.4mpd,btohqsg

Just checking those who use the FairPrice app to pay at kopitiam. The ordering need to is to be done via app right ? Doesn‚Äôt seemed to be able to let the stall scan for payment. Some stall are also not in the app list.,btohqsg

First point hsbc Revolution only earns 0.4mpd. Second point Apple Watch can solve the problem just double tap,btohqsg
Which card should I use for transport in SG? Hope you can share? ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
I was trying to avoid getting a Apple Watch  not that is not good but trying to optimize all my spendings,btohqsg
Can try SC smart card for 6% cashback. Similar to hsbc there is no annual fee monitoring required. But just more cards to manage,btohqsg
https://www.revolut.com/en-SG/legal/publictransportpromo/Note the requirements to transfer 300 in *by Bank Transfer*  after using $50 I personally switch to ezlink (but I think there are probably better options),btohqsg
SSB rates for the 1st year already better ..,btohqsg
Not sure UOB have tricky terms and conditions,btohqsg
Hello guys   any kind word/beststrategy for foreign currency purchase (I.e. luxury bag in Paris)? Is it better to exchange EUR at Arcade and buy with cash better? Or use credit card better?,btohqsg
They are trash. The risk-free-rate products from the gov have been better for months and as usual the banks are slow to move. Why would I put in a 20k min for a 12 month lockup for a measly 2.x% when the T-bill for the same tenor has only a 1k min and yields over 3% pa?,btohqsg
+ AAA rating from the SG gov vs RHB's BBB+,btohqsg
And oso  any idea wads the effective tax refund rate for luxury goods in Germany?,btohqsg
I would use Citi Cashback+ 1.6% + amaze for this,btohqsg
Anyone know where is the best place to save money?,btohqsg
But not that kind of put in cannot take out ya. Just a place with higher interests and still can take out when needed.,btohqsg
Tonight i will talk about high interest saving accounts,btohqsg
T bills are similar to SSB?,btohqsg
T BILL the issue is liquidity. If you have to break due to some reson.  Very hard to sell.  In FD if you break yoi let go of the interest but the principal is back.But in TBill there is no market. As in you will struggle to find buyer and may be have to sell at discount,btohqsg
Is it wise to do citi cashback+ AND grabpay?,btohqsg
