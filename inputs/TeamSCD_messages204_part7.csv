üÜòÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏èThis kind of thing happens to me too‚ö†Ô∏èüÜò5/6/2023 Singapore üá∏üá¨ Take customers to GentingAt about 5.40am in the morning  this car followed me at about 27km from kulai. I was fast and it was fast and I was slow. At the rest stop  I continued to walk  and at about 37km  it was next to me again with blue lights flashing. I thought it was the police  and wanted to stop beside me. At the moment  I thought that this car was following me and then went to rest Standing next to me now. I used two spring belts to think together. At that time  I told customers to sit down and we might encounter fake police. At that time  I had to play a game with it and not let it stop in front of me.During the race with it  I called 999  and the police uncle asked me where I was  and told me not to stop  and if it still followed  go to the nearest police station.At about 71km  I didn‚Äôt look at it and followed it. Now at 8.10am  I stop at a crowded place to let customers have breakfast.üÜòIf a policeman who is not a police car asks you to stop  you have to look at the situation at the time. Don‚Äôt stop indiscriminately. It‚Äôs best to go directly to the nearby police stationüÜò,btohqsg
