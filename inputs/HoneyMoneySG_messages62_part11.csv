Pretty much everything explained in Chris's video but personally   more concerned of security of cards (fraud cases seems to be on the rise lately too),btohqsg
Didnt know can call the bank to block the transaction and reverse it if fraud,btohqsg
amex pay sometimes randomly starts to fail. you can try unlinking and relinking your card to amex pay right before a QR payment and it'll usually work on the next scan,btohqsg
Call CSO to clear the ‚Äúerror‚Äù registrations from backend then redo the installation. Follow their instructions over the phone.,btohqsg
If debit card then no way already. Cuz the money straight out of account.,btohqsg
Hi all :) I would like to ask for the UOB EVOL card. Does spending at UOB$ merchants count towards the $600 minimum card spend required?There are also some UOB $ merchants that only award UOB$ cashback with a minimum spend criteria (e.g. giant min spend $50). So if I spent only $5  and since I won‚Äôt be getting UOB$ cashback  will I still get 8% mobile contactless or 0.3% all other spend cashback or nothing?Thanks in advance! :),btohqsg
for uob one cc  the spending of $500 per month is there merchants to be qualified? or i can just simply paywave or applepay any merchant,btohqsg
so long not in exclusion list in the TnC,btohqsg
"then those merchants under ""additional cashback"" are just bonus? can i understand as this? bcos like for eg evol there are different categories and its so confusing  not suree if its the same for this One card",btohqsg

Hello! I newly opened a UOB One Account but unfortunately the company policy doesn‚Äôt allow for me to change the bank details that my salary gets credited to until the end of the year  and i don‚Äôt have any monthly GIRO payments to be made at the moment. Is there any other way that I can transfer my salary over for it to be counted for the higher interest rate?,btohqsg
u will earn 6mpd for 30 dollar transacted.  cause round down to $5 block  assuming u have no other txn.if u have other txn that is maybe 2 dollars  then total will push to 36.20  round down to 35,btohqsg

I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúUob salary transfer‚Äù to search chat history to see what other reply.,btohqsg
Thank you :) just to clarify  when you say some people get it  you‚Äôre referring to the $600 spend  card cashback (8% or 0.3%)  or both?,btohqsg
Citibank is the only one who goes around telling customers MAX 5 credit cards per customer.Never heard of UOB having such a rule.That being said  one of my humans has:1. UOB One2. UOB Evol3. UOB Lady4. UOB Visa Signature5. UOB Absolute6. UOB PPV7. UOB Krisflyer8. UOB PRVI Amexso definitely not max of 2 cards for UOB customers.,btohqsg
It is not grey. Count for min spend  but don't earn any cashback.,btohqsg
Based on personal experience  and so far all DPs from other people support this argument.,btohqsg
yes  I have the same experience  but my last read in tnc say no  that's why I say grey,btohqsg
Based on t&c  you will get the cashback if you are still within cashback limit. It will also be counted as eligible spending.Only the transactions that were rewarded with UOB$ will not be counted as eligible spending nor it will be rewarded cashback.Simple black and white English. Lol idk what's the discussion about.,btohqsg
at max  will loss $40  but can try to appeal,btohqsg
i always try not to spend in uob merchants (if remember),btohqsg

Anyone receive anything about 500 cashback on UOB cards spending over 3 months.,btohqsg
Oh  I saw the last update at the right hand side is today (25Aug) 7:15AM. Please ignore this message  thanks!,btohqsg
Shall wait for the next working day to update again.,btohqsg
Thanks for the response :) So if I understand correctly  if I already spent $250 on mobile contactless and spend another $5 at Giant  I will earn 0.3% cashback?Cause I saw an 2 year old article whereby in the same situation the person was awarded 0% cashback. Can‚Äôt link or send photo here. Article is ‚ÄúNerfed/Buffed: UOB$ Programme Quietly Excluded For UOB EVOL  But Might Offer Extra Rebates for UOB One‚Äù,btohqsg
Honestly I also want to know if the eligible spending that exceeded the cashback limit will be counted as 0.3% or not. But then again  it's so negligible I won't bother about the 0.3% and just switch to another card for the 5%/3%/1.7% if I have to.Based on UOB EVOL T&C  it still states UOB$ awarded transactions as part of exclusion  so I will just assume that it is still valid.,btohqsg
Hi for the uob one National day promo   must we transfer e.g 50 000 at one shot? Cos usually I will test the system by transferring $1 first üòÖ,btohqsg
"I don't think it's a ""transfer into fixed deposit account"" kind of deal.You just make sure your UOB bank account has the $50k first then apply for this.",btohqsg
on this topic  i‚Äôve heard some tips like have to empty your bank account and add one lump sum back at a certain date so not to lose out on the interest etc. anyone can advice?,btohqsg
