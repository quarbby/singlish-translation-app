If you can afford it  do it in Singapore as easier to go back for any rectification,btohqsg
my current car have a sound system from previous owner but im not very sure what brand is that  sounds still acceptable to me.but sometimes if i on too loud can hear the frame vibrating... so i thought maybe soundproofing will be a better choice,btohqsg
maybe try turn down bass first,btohqsg
However if you know of a good place in Malaysia  would be cheaper,btohqsg
i only go malaysia for tint bahaha,btohqsg
its on about 30% only üòÖ,btohqsg
You might want to get it tuned properly and turning the bass down. Usually if you upgrade sound system without dampening in jap or Korean cars  can hear a lot of vibrations and rattling,btohqsg
any good recommendation?my office carpark is open space area  lunch time i dont even want to drive out due to the heat.open door got heatwave one...,btohqsg
If you go for dampening  please don't cheap out as it can spoil your panels with the butile melting and make the situation worse in terms of audio quality,btohqsg
yeah but idk who to look for on such stuff,btohqsg
Tints will only help so much here,btohqsg
for these sg got infratint and rikecool,btohqsg
What you need is to use those folding windshield heat reflectors,btohqsg
but ya this is great when u park ur car,btohqsg
those dont help tho  i tried and still hot  maybe coz my car black colour.,btohqsg
Drown out the random knocking sound in your engine bay too,btohqsg
i did it for few months until i give up coz not much diff,btohqsg
Try foon audio garage  they're on the higher side in terms of pricing but very reliable,btohqsg
In that case  try opening your rear passenger window and turning on your aircon when you get in first,btohqsg
tbf i subaru so alw loose one,btohqsg
And then use your driver door as a fan and open-cloae it a few times,btohqsg
It sends out the hot air in your car,btohqsg
yeah i do that when i urgently need to use the car in afternoon  else i work till sunset then go home,btohqsg
but must open opp side window,btohqsg
