Fudan is a Chinese uni right,btohqsg
20k in his first job? Wow  impressive,btohqsg
Isn't studying law usually more relevant to local context,btohqsg
So studying law in a Chinese University means you'll study more on Chinese law right,btohqsg
It's standard pay in US law firms,btohqsg
The value of a chinese degree is alluring to others cos he can also speak chinese,btohqsg
Hence he got hired to work in US lor,btohqsg
