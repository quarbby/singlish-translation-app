Yes any number of rooms. Just not whole flat.,btohqsg
Any idea when can block 447A be having Top? Has the main building structure built above 15 storey?,btohqsg
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong If you‚Äôre not getting your HDB within your studies year  it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem (if you can get some job by then)If you‚Äôre getting your HDB within  then you have to find ways to offset the amount because you cannot get the keys without paying off the house.,btohqsg
If u mean get the keys then yea  I‚Äôll most likely have been working for 3-4 years by then  currently approaching final year as well,btohqsg
Nonetheless  I think you might need to fork out 10% or 5% down payment first.Check the HDB website for the latest update.,btohqsg
during signing of lease still need pay 5% downpayment  then key collection is 15%,btohqsg
Yes i get that. And we can definitely do the down payment with no issues.Original question was regarding if anyone has experienced their loan quantum increase due to significant increase in household income (i.e. My HLE is low because it doesnt count my current income since I‚Äôm a student  but near key collection i will have worked for at least 2-3 years),btohqsg
im in the exact same situation ah  the officer said HLE amount for mine will be revised 6months prior to key collection  the current hle amount can just ignore cos im student a student.my friend also same situation  student when signing lease  hle approval XXk only  then just collect keys last month hle approve to max 520k.,btohqsg
Ah okay sounds the same on my side as well  thanks!,btohqsg

Hi I recently submitted my HLE. I provided 3 months of my payslip (Nov-Jan). I received companies bonus in December and January. Does this mean i will get a higher loan since the income i declared for Dec and Jan is higher than my net income?,btohqsg
Bonus is not considered as part of the income assessment for hle  see linkhttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/financing-a-flat-purchase/application-for-an-hdb-loan-eligibility-hle-letter/income-guidelines-and-documents,btohqsg
The more u earn The less grant discount you receive from HDB,btohqsg
Hi  checking.1st questionWe have a Q Number on hand alr. Flat selection date is from March 2023 onwards. Let's say if we looking at upcoming may 2023 sales of balance can we apply at the same time with our bto Q Number on hand?2nd question - if we were called to select our flat before the launch of sales of balance on may 2023. Can we still apply for the sales of balance by forfeiting our selected flat?,btohqsg
1) Can2) Can. Provided you have not rejected more than twice before. If you did then you'll be downgraded to second timer for 1 year,btohqsg
To be specific. If selection date fall after the sales of balance launch we can just apply for sbf then wait for result?If our selection date falls before the sales of balance launch we can secure a unit first? Then come may 2023 apply for sbf again then if get a q number for sales of balance do we need to give up the selected unit to go choose the sales of balance unit? Or can concurrently hold the bto unit while go select the sales of balance unit?,btohqsg
for ehg grant isit both couples must be working for 50k or can be 1 working and 1 not working,btohqsg
Hi guys  is it possible to have multiple concurrent HLE loans?,btohqsg
In general  up until you select a flat  you can apply to any launch (bto or sbf) and as many as you want. This means  if your selection date of your BTO falls after the SBF launch  yes you can apply for SBF launch.However  once you have selected at unit (either through BTO or SBF)  all applications made will be cancelled. In general  you can have multiple applications from various launches  but once you have selected a flat  all other applications will be removed from the system. This means you will lose any queue number you have for other applications.Once you have selected a unit  if you were to give it up  you will be penalised - you cannot apply for any launch (bto or sbf) for 1 year.Tl;dr- you can apply for other launches even while you hold a queue number for a launch- once you select a unit  all other applications are cancelled so you cannot hold a queue number while you already have a unit from HDB- once you select  there's a penalty for withdrawing  which is that you cant apply for other launches for 1 year,btohqsg
Can be 1 working 1 not working. They will just look at the total income between the 2 of you.You can take a look at the example given by HDB on the EHG page  it seems to be exactly your situation  even the grant amount they gave as an example hahahttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families/enhanced-cpf-housing-grant-families,btohqsg
Is it better to buy BTO or resale for single.,btohqsg
BTO  better if u get thru opening booking of flats  shorter waiting time.,btohqsg
Hi normally open booking will be which month(s) ?,btohqsg
There'll be 1 in March. After that dunno.Check out the Open Booking section here:https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing,btohqsg
If property value is $550k.How much downpayment is required for SBF immediate key collection? 20%?,btohqsg
Are you eligible for staggered downpayment scheme?,btohqsg
no staggered downpayment for immediate key collection units. sign lease and key collection is same day. no time to stagger,btohqsg
ooo I see... Means 20% straight with buyer stamp duty  survey fee  HDB conveyancing fees?,btohqsg
What if you're able to pay this part  however you're HLE is unable to cover the balance cost of the flat?Does that mean you can't secure the unit or u have to top up with cash and cpf in the future?,btohqsg
Then you need to top up with cash/cpf,btohqsg
But you're still able to secure a unit during the lease agreement?,btohqsg
Recieved my queue number for NOV 22 sbf for geylang,btohqsg
However looking at the current valuation it's around $500k- $550k for most units,btohqsg
I see... Please do budget according to the completion timeline. Take the earlier date as the completion date so that you won't be caught off guard.,btohqsg
80% of the units are completed,btohqsg
Only with key collection as from what I saw,btohqsg
uh  I might be wrong but I believe the top up is not in the far future  but during key collection.it works differently with bto because booking of flat to key collection is years apart,btohqsg
Ya that's why i asked him to budget according to the completion timeline as it is can be much nearer than a BTO.,btohqsg
I believe as long as u pay the full 20% and with the etc you're able to secure the unit?,btohqsg
Balance is paid with the HLE amount  Enhanced grant and if needed to top up then monthly cash?,btohqsg
Not really knowledgeable on this but base on what I read online,btohqsg
I'm leaning towards no. essentially the max loan amount is what hdb think you can afford to pay back. anything more  it means hdb doesn't think you can pay it back  so they need to see the cash upfront.,btohqsg
monthly cash topups are for people with not enough cpf to pay for the monthly loan mortgage. but the loan was enough to cover cost of unit,btohqsg
So basically ur loan must cover the balance cost of the unit after 20% payment.,btohqsg
Or else we need to pay upfront cash,btohqsg
yes  I think the lowest for Geylang is 498k if that helps and you're ok with low floors,btohqsg
Hahaha as long as have a house immediately,btohqsg

Which stage of the BTO are you at now?,btohqsg
Currently planning to do this for the upcoming launch   Havent balloted yet,btohqsg
If you haven't balloted then you have the choice whether you want to do co-applicant or main applicant and essential occupier now.I think the latest to change is during flat selection. Do clarify with HDB as well via email.,btohqsg
Yes  only can do when you submit the bto applicationIf after flat selection  probably still can appeal.After down payment  there is no way to change unless you have super good reason.,btohqsg
Will it be open for BTO registration tmr?,btohqsg
any ways to check units availability before appointment?,btohqsg

I‚Äôm wondering  is it good to sell my resale 5 room flat in Elias and get a BTO in non matured area?,btohqsg
Because I think our flat is too big for 3 ladies after my dad passed away 2 months ago.,btohqsg
you don't need to sell until within 6 months after key collection for the BTO.,btohqsg
yeap i read  hopefully can sell at a good price because bto is kinda costly,btohqsg
i think we can't get 4 rooms since they prioritize 1st timer,btohqsg
Well it depends on where you pick... Non matured estate you need to balance between your budget for the BTO (taking into account the downpayment and buyer stamp duty fees) and the subsequent costs  as well as reno cost and moving cost.,btohqsg
yeap i'm looking out for tampines and pasir ris,btohqsg
oh but those areas are matured estates though. Doesn't seem to fit in your original question of BTO in non matured area...,btohqsg
my friend complained to me that her apartment walls are too thin in BTO flat,btohqsg
yeap  can just ballot and try but i doubt we can get it,btohqsg
got ballot means got hope üòÅ Btw  if you're balloting under MCPS  then it might be best to add in your youngest as the essential occupier. Hopefully young enough that when the flat reaches MOP  your youngest will have ample time to BTO herself.,btohqsg
i'm the youngest haha  both my big sis and i will be buying the house and add my mom as occupier,btohqsg
we are second timer because our mom previously used up the grant 2 times üò≠,btohqsg
but both my sis and i haven't even purchase any HDB flats before,btohqsg
I see... Then maybe can try appealing to HDB to see if they willing to give yall first timer priority. No harm trying to appeal.,btohqsg
oh it's possible? how to? need to get a BTO first?,btohqsg
in getting a bto or grant?,btohqsg
Try from second timer to first timer ba. At least that will give you more allocation percentage.,btohqsg
Any one knows how to generate the ballot number? Is it based on the registration time/queue number or not?,btohqsg
Only HDB know. But unlikely based on time cause they have to also factor in priority scheme allocation and they mentioned that it is not based on fastest fingers before.,btohqsg

Hi  I would like to ask:If my fiance signed on  does that mean he completed his NS? (Because they asked about it during the application),btohqsg

You asking for BTO or SBF flats?,btohqsg
Option to purchase is paid during the first appointment (flat selection) via NETS.Second appointment (6-9 months after your first appointment) you pay: downpayment of flat (5% if under staggered downpayment scheme  10% if not under the scheme)  buyer stamp duty fees and HDB conveyancing fees.Your EHG will be disbursed before your second appointment and goes into paying your downpayment for your second appointment. For these payments during the second appointment  you can use full CPF.,btohqsg
Do you also know if the balloting numbers are grouped by project or by room-type?,btohqsg

THOSE who turn down theirfirst chanceto choose a flat in the HDB‚Äôs Built-To-Order (BTO) exerciseswill be bumped downthe BTO queue  in a rule tightening designed to shorten the long lines for new public housing flats.In the past three years  about 40 per cent of applicants who have been invited to book a BTO flat failed to do so ‚Äì either by declining the offer or missing their flat selection appointment. This amounts to around 10 000 applicants per year.Currently  those who decline to book a flat are issued a non-selection count and are given up to two non-selections before they are bumped down the line.,btohqsg

yes no grants available. u will be under the deferred income scheme  where hdb will assess your income again 3 (?) months before key collection  only then u can get your grants approvedmeans u have to pay the full 5% downpayment without grants (if you‚Äôre under staggered downpayment scheme thing),btohqsg

i not so old not yet mdm üò≠,btohqsg
So even if I‚Äôm a student but part time  I still should apply under student?,btohqsg
yes  part time work/intern not counted as income assessment,btohqsg
Then actually when there‚Äôs no income=no grant  is harder for Uni/army ppl to apply even if we want toüòÖüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
isnt the downpay 20%  and split 10 10%?,btohqsg
the ehg is determined on the first appt yea?,btohqsg
yea it‚Äôs quite a pain in the ass  i‚Äôm a ft student but also working and they also didn‚Äôt want to assess my income,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why govt introduced the staggered downpayment scheme and deferred income scheme for those not working full time,btohqsg
Yes but which means during the downpayment part  is quite difficult,btohqsg
ESP if still need to pay the other misc,btohqsg
yeaa  so just have to fork out yourself  or ask parents for money  or get a loan to cover that hahaha,btohqsg
I think for staggered is 5% then 15%,btohqsg
yea this is the original default one  if you‚Äôre under 30 years old u can opt for the staggered downpayment scheme (5% at first downpayment  15% at key collection),btohqsg
ohhh i thought will split evenly. okok thanks for the info!!,btohqsg
Anyone planning to get the serangoon one?,btohqsg
Wah means no grant  cpf no money  need fork out cold hard cash as a student,btohqsg
if applying for plh  650k unit  5% is 32k ish  split 2 ppl is 16k each + stamp duties legal fees wtv WITHOUT GRANT,btohqsg
Okay la but can use cpf so nt entirely gone case,btohqsg
Prob need to go outside take loan,btohqsg
Can determine the proportion? Like say 80% use the guy cpf  20% use the girl,btohqsg
But if let‚Äôs say we take loan from bank to pay downpayment  does it affect us signing for housing loan? Just curious,btohqsg
I mean if that‚Äôs the worse case scenario la,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt want to take money from parents,btohqsg
bto for students is expensive üò¢,btohqsg
Ya actually is quite funny the fact that gov wanna ask us to get married and have kids earlier but yet bto for full time uni student is so hard,btohqsg
ESP if upcoming may bto  serangoon confirm hot spot also,btohqsg
and waiting time so long also  else i would earn money and apply later and still get a bto in my late 20s,btohqsg
Ya lo because of the waiting time  that why me n my bf want to apply earlier but Haix,btohqsg
Agreed  but I wanted to make sure have enough if nt we are the one is gonna suffer if ever we managed to get it,btohqsg
we all apply  then after actually get the q number and book flat then wonder how to pay off ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ but if got full time job then still okay la,btohqsg
if let‚Äôs say we take loan from bank to pay downpayment  does it affect us signing for housing loan? Just curious,btohqsg
Student can apply for deferred income assessment no meh?,btohqsg
Best is one working one studying Grant Gao Gao 80 kBook one woodlands bto maybe 220+ k can get Liao,btohqsg
It doesn't affect. I'm under bank loan from the start and have signed my lease agreement during my second appointment.,btohqsg
You just need to be aware that when you take a bank loan  your downpayment is 5% cash and 20% CPF/cash,btohqsg
If you are under staggered downpayment scheme  your second appointment you pay 10%  out of which 5%mustbe cash.During third appointment you pay remaining 15% downpayment using CPF/cash.If not under staggered downpayment scheme  then5% must be in cash and 15% CPF/cashDuring third appointment you pay 5% in CPF,btohqsg
This one shld be for applicants under the age of 30,btohqsg
Can't seem to locate the document... What is your question ah?,btohqsg
I was asking this!But if let‚Äôs say we take loan from bank to pay downpayment  does it affect us signing for housing loan? Just curious,btohqsg
Cause students don‚Äôt have any grants yet to be received to pay for downpayment,btohqsg
This is if I‚Äôm taking a loan or ?,btohqsg
Doesn't affect. But you need to be aware of these costs.If both of you are students or have not been working for more than 12 months  then you are automatically under Deferred Income Assessment.,btohqsg
Ok i go check it out thanks a lot,btohqsg
Yes. It applies if you are taking a bank loan.,btohqsg
My bf is in NS and I‚Äôm studying Uni but working part time,btohqsg
Then can I ask if let‚Äôs say I apply housing loan from hdb  is it still the same as compared to outside bank loan?,btohqsg
Not counted. As long as you're a full time student  you'll be under Deferred Income Assessment.Got ppl try before liao,btohqsg
Can you elaborate what you mean by same as compared to bank loan?,btohqsg
Bank loan means like I take a loan from outside bank like example Maybank or DBS etcThen if I‚Äôm nt wrong  I rmb we can take housing loan from hdb itself. But I‚Äôm not sure if housing loan can be immediately to be disbursed to be use for downpayment?  Or the housing loan is just for future,btohqsg
You going for BTO or SBF?,btohqsg
Bank loan need proof of income if not they won't lend to you.Most likely you are auto Deferred Income Assessment (DIA).Meaning your HLE and EHG will be assessed nearer to key collection.Please read up on how DIA works.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/booking-of-flatPlease also note that even if you are under DIA  you are still required to pay the option fee during first appointment  and 5% downpayment (assuming you are under Staggered downpayment scheme)  buyer stamp duty fees and HDB conveying fees during your second appointment.,btohqsg
I also got a bto flat‚Ä¶ i paid 10% downpayment with my ehg,btohqsg
You took bank loan or HDB loan?,btohqsg
And selected a unit on Jun 2022,btohqsg
Ok then just follow this. Just budget and prepare the option fee and the second appointment payments. After that should be nothing to pay until just before key collection,btohqsg
I got a 2 room flexi unit,btohqsg
Yours is how many room flat,btohqsg
From August 2023 onwards  first-time homebuyers who register one non-selection will be relegated to second-timer status for a year. If they then still decline to choose a flat  they will be blocked from HDB sales exercises for a year. The change will also apply to the Sale-of-Balance-Flats (SBF) programme.Second-timers have much lower priority and fewer opportunities to book a flat. Almost all ‚Äì at least 95 per cent ‚Äì of BTO flats are reserved for first-timers.The non-selection count will be waived for those with 10 or fewer BTO flats to choose from at their flat selection appointment  or five or fewer SBF flats to choose from.,btohqsg
Choose or lose your BTO spot: HDB tightens rules on flat selection,btohqsg
Bank will not loan you cash if you don't have full time employment records,btohqsg
If financial no issue 2 is better coz your cash went into asset while in 1 it goes into depreciating liability (car),btohqsg
u looking at ulu pandan 4 room or 3 room?,btohqsg
Agree. Just apply first coz by the time build and near key collection easily 5 yrs from now by then uvwill draw good full time salary. I hope by student u mean final year not first year,btohqsg
How did u apply for the HDB Loan? Can perhaps full time uni students or NS ppl apply if ever get a slot for selection?,btohqsg
Understand! How about the HDB loan that you guys have been mentioning?,btohqsg
That is part of hdb application process where they will only assess your income near the end of whole long process. I guess the thing to ask hdb now is to give u a clearer timeline given X project u applying for,btohqsg
Is there an email address or ?,btohqsg
u can just call them directly,btohqsg
they can answer basically every question you have,btohqsg
Today I good mood I spoon-feed u.,btohqsg
I saw this that day for the staggered downpayment scheme and this deferred income statement thing,btohqsg
So find a good stable job and choose unit wisely don't waste your one time chance and all the best.,btohqsg
But was just concerning regarding if let‚Äôs say idh enough cpf  so my only option is to pay the remaining by cash right?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still a full time uni student while my partner is in NS but gonna ORD in Seo,btohqsg
By the time u working full time there will be whole line of people wanting to offer u loans.,btohqsg
But then how about during downpayments?,btohqsg
Before your flat selection appt you need to apply for HLE (hdb loan eligibility letter).. you will need your payslips to apply.. as for full time uni students or ns ppl im not too sure,btohqsg
CPF housing grant recipientsYou have to pay at least 5% of the purchase price using your CPF OA savings and/ or cash when the CPF housing grant that you qualify for exceeds 95% of the purchase price of the flat. Excess housing grant amount (if any) can be used to pay for any Optional Component Scheme items and the price premiums that single applicants and Singapore Citizen/ Singapore Permanent Resident households have to pay  before it is credited into your CPF Special/ Retirement and Medisave accounts.,btohqsg
Means die die u need 5% in cash or cpf,btohqsg
If u can't even afford this means u not ready.,btohqsg
I shall just work more shifts firstüòÇ,btohqsg
OR u trying for flat too expensive for your budget.,btohqsg
is ur partner going to continue study after ns?,btohqsg
U save more until he worked good job at least 6 mths,btohqsg
Otherwise have to count on parents for the 5%,btohqsg
Last time I borrowed from several banks credit to make up down payment but I had stable job and confident. Don't try if not confident....,btohqsg
Yes looking potentially at maybe the may serangoon,btohqsg
Cause within 4km from my partner parents house also so thought got proximity grant,btohqsg
Proximity grant doesn't apply to BTO isn't it,btohqsg
No proximity grants for bto  thats for resale,btohqsg
The benefit of proximity for bto is qualifying for MCPS,btohqsg
Doesnt  just an extra ballot chance instead,btohqsg
For the sake and clarity of helping you understand and also to clear any doubts:1. You are a student and your partner is in NS - You are automatically under Deferred Income Assessment (DIA). This is because as of flat application time  neither of you have worked for in full-time employment at least 12 months hence  HDB/Bank are unable to assess your income hence they are not willing to extend you any loans. Now as you are under DIA  the HLE and Enhanced Housing Grant (EHG) will only be assessed nearer to the key collection time (4-6 years from now).2. What you need to pay in the near future:First Appointment aka Flat selection date (a few months after you ballot for the BTO): Option fee during your flat selection (Can range from $500-$2k depending on the house type you choose during your flat application).Second Appointment aka Downpayment date (6-9 months after Flat Selection): Downpayment (5% of the unit price)  Buyer Stamp Duty (Can be calculated here:https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx?target=MSDCalculatorSelection)  HDB Conveyancing Fees (Can be calculated here:https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB14LFEESENQ/BB14PHomePage.jsp)So what you need to do is:1. Budget well taking all these factors into account. If CPF not enough to cover  you need to pay in cash. As long as you can cough up the money HDB won't reject your ballot.2. Think long and hard about your r/s as this is a big commitment  probably the biggest purchase in your foreseeable next few decades.3. If you think not enough money now  earn first then eventually try for BTO down the road or SBF or resale. This is timeline dependent  meaning how urgent you need the housing.,btohqsg

No ah some BTOs built over 7 years,btohqsg
I think that's delayed from covid right? If not all hdb estimated 5 yrs leh,btohqsg
What I know is pinnacle build more than 5 years,btohqsg
If upon launch more than 5 years  u check with hdb officers upon selecting the bto  I think that's more confirm answer,btohqsg
For now they clearing covid backlog. Should be better soon. Hopefully.,btohqsg
U can try. But they downright said no. My bto is 6+ - 7 yrs also a no. And that‚Äôs before the market so hot like now.,btohqsg
Your bto kana delay by covid?,btohqsg

share your floor plan? cant figure out what you are saying.,btohqsg
1 flat with longer kitchen & 1 flat with short kitchen   I was wondering why?  Finally saw the picture  useless long walkway,btohqsg
Space is money & this walkway is deem useless,btohqsg
My purpose is to warn about HDB design to create meaningless useless space which you had paid with your hard earn money   look at their layout properly that every inches of space can serve you,btohqsg
Hi I balloted for the nov bto for Queenstown and have gotten a decent number  is it still possible for me to apply for another this may 2023?,btohqsg
BTO from Aug 2023 is for serious buyer only  40% of them will be bar for 1 year.,btohqsg
On Saturday  he said the ‚Äúnon-selection count‚Äù was in response to the concerns of Singaporeans that while there are many applicants ‚Äútrying very hard to get a BTO flat‚Äù  including families and singles  up to 40 per cent of applicants each year do not book a flat when invited to do so.,btohqsg
Which project and how many rooms?,btohqsg
Hi. Lets say after i have book unit paid $2k. Upcoming sbf/obf can i still apply?,btohqsg
Anyways this is the link for the article:https://dollarsandsense.sg/happens-cancel-bto-application-different-stages/,btohqsg
You posted the same question in Yishun chat HAHAHA I replied there,btohqsg
I found a link that can watch current hdb hub bto model building... Link üëáhttps://youtu.be/OtQeX0ByIu4,btohqsg
Hi dear experts here  its my first time BTOing hope someone more experienced can assist me.My queue number for Nov 22 BTO is slightly beyond the total number of units. If I submit cancelation of application now on HDB website  will it be a non-selection count? I have NOT been invited for selection yet.,btohqsg
Yes  it will be considered a non-selection count. Non-selection count refers to any situation where you are eligible to be invited down for selection but you did not select  for whatever reason,btohqsg
Thank you Bern for your kind assistance. My thoughts is since HDB give 3 times ballot numbers for every unit  wouldn't it unfair to penalize two-thirds of all applicants just because we do not select the leftover units?,btohqsg
Because they know 40% don't select,btohqsg
After Aug 2023 the above will be History  only serious BTOing will apply.,btohqsg
Nope  sounds perfectly fair. For example  for 100 units and the first 89 people picked  there is no difference between the 90th in queue and 300th in queue if everyone else don't select the flat.,btohqsg
Those who like to select the type they want should go Resale ASAP before Resale go for another bull run and cooling measure again.,btohqsg
Maybe the bulk of the 40% who did not select unit  came from the two-third applicants whose ballot numbers are beyond unit number?,btohqsg
No need to think about the 40% anymore  it will be History,btohqsg
In fact before Aug 2023 those not serious are already looking at resale now.,btohqsg
There is a possibility. Simply looking at 40% as a singular number is not sufficient to understand dropout rate  as a) this number is calculated at the end of selection process and does not show the trend through the selection processand b) this is indicative of average dropout across all units types and launches. So each launch and each unit type may follow a different pattern.For reference  when I tracked for my launch (non-mature)  average was about 15-17% dropout for most of the selection period  at the end of it it was 26-32% dropout rate depending on unit type.But I know there are other launches that are 20+% dropout already from the start of selections.,btohqsg
Thank you Bern for your insight!,btohqsg
Hi..when do i possibly receive my keys for blk 639A?,btohqsg
hi does anyone have any experience regarding minimum retirement sum? If im collecting my bto flat only past 55  can i tell cpf i need my cpf to pay for the bto?,btohqsg
No experience but I am guessing u may pledge your flat to make up the basic retirement sum as option.....,btohqsg
Just to add onto above inputs  as long as you continue working OA can still be used to finance your flat,btohqsg
Best to get an appointment with CPF to discuss this with them,btohqsg
when you cancel  you forfeit the deposit,btohqsg
U mean the walkway to bedroom one izit,btohqsg
Area around the toilet   assume that area expended,btohqsg

Yes so I‚Äôm asking when will the 1 year ban be lifted,btohqsg
Hi  currently I am studying and my partner is working full time. My Partner salary alone can cover the cost of mortgage.Is it possible for my partner to become a essential occupier and if so when do we declare this status. Doing so to avoid the potential future two house stamp tax.,btohqsg
Gxgx :) when you submit your flat application  there is an option for you to select co applicants  main applicant/essential occupier.Are you past that stage?,btohqsg
Yep but wasn't able to see the options of essential occupier,btohqsg
We only saw Co applicant and main applicant,btohqsg
Oh flat application as in go down to hdb ?,btohqsg
So which one did y'all pick?,btohqsg
Main applicant and essential occupier is the one you want,btohqsg
Is it still possible to change ?,btohqsg
Must let HDB officer know during flat selection that you want to change it,btohqsg
That will be the last time you can change if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
You do realize that you cant use essential occupier CPF to pay right? If you‚Äôre using cash then ok. But if you don‚Äôt have an income means you don‚Äôt have HLE either. You will have to use Cash or CPF if you have any to top up/pay for the shortfall.,btohqsg

Hello guys questions to fully utilize the HLE (BTO)When best to apply for HLE?First appointment with HDB for first down payment /Just before key collection /Anytime in-between?,btohqsg
You need to apply for HLE before your selection appointment. But note that this is not the final assessment so you dont have to worry - your HLE will be reassessed right before key collection for your actual loan amount,btohqsg
Need to apply beforehand for HLE b4 keys collection?,btohqsg
Wil they notified us to apply earlier?,btohqsg
Based on my calls with HDB officers  the HLE before key collection is not a new application  more like renewal.They will inform us to submit the relevant documents when the time comes (a few months before key collection),btohqsg
At least 12 months up to the latest month prior to submission,btohqsg
Hi  any group for rivervale shore?,btohqsg
Oh ya  I vaguely remember somethings needed 12 months some needed only 3 months. I can‚Äôt remember exactly what needed 12 months or 3 months. Sorry for the confusion,btohqsg
12 months is EHG  3 months is HLE.,btohqsg
I did my HLE before my Nov 2022 ballot. I just followed the HDB website. And it‚Äôs on the portal stating that it is valid for 6 months. Pls correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.They asked for 15 months payslip and corresponding CPF statement for the HLE.During the ballot was only 3 months.,btohqsg
Your first and last paragraph correct as far as I know.Your middle paragraph I never hear before. From what I know  the 15 months is only required during flat selection and not HLE.Anyone else can shed some light on this would be good...,btohqsg
Ya precisely. Was shocked also when they requested for 15 months. Not too sure is it a new thing or what. Had to call my partner to scramble and quickly get the payslips üòÖ,btohqsg
Are any of y'all self employed? That could be one of the reasons,btohqsg
We‚Äôre both full time employees. However  my partner‚Äôs company contributes his pay from 2 separate entities. They did also ask for statement from company. Actually true. Perhaps that‚Äôs why 15 months was requested.,btohqsg
This should be the reason ba. If it's not the norm they might request more docs to do more calculations and their due diligence.,btohqsg
Currently me and my partner have gotten a 500ish q during last years December exercise. However we realise that this year may exercise might be more suitable for us.Assuming if I go for the May Bto as well and have gotten a q number for May  can I reject this August and September appointment of my december exercise from last year   without hurting my chance for May?,btohqsg
Jsut take note that if u already booked a flat and paid the option fee then u can't apply for another BTO. Because once u apply for another project and your 1st appointment is UP then they will automatically cancel other applications,btohqsg
Meaning u can still apply for May if you know that the May result out before your appointment for your previous application.,btohqsg
Hi guys...i just wanna ask. What is housing loan for purchase of hdb? Is it hle,btohqsg

Assuming your launch is after Sep 30 2022  Downpayment at signing lease appt is 10% if youre not under staggered downpayment scheme and 5% if youre under staggered downpayment scheme. Then the rest of the 20% is paid at key collection,btohqsg

Hello guys questionsAs waiting for Feb BTO results are we allowed to apply open booking of flat too?,btohqsg
but keep in mind once you book the flat from OBF  your feb BTO will not be considered anymore,btohqsg
does book OBF flat mean paying OTP or just applying for it,btohqsg
book OBF flat means you go down and select the flat.apply OBF flat is applying and pay the $10 OTP,btohqsg

hihi if for OBF  what is the waiting time to get keys? or is the flat has finished being built? sorry first timer here,btohqsg
Depends which flat you booked. Some are flats sold back to HDB. Think you can get the keys soon? But those leftover from bto need to wait for bto to complete. For me  i booked last year for a leftover bto completing next year. Like that count ard 2years.,btohqsg

Depends on your needs . If u think 1 room can put double deck bed the lower one can pull out another bed to totally sleeo 3 pax ok. 1 toilet .Means 3 pax if all 3 working office hrs need to wait for the others pax to finished right?So 3 pax is enough for some but 3 pax in flexi 2rm is not suitable for some,btohqsg
U go plan   long term ok or not . If not ok go for 3rm,btohqsg
Because my friend already regretted to get 2rm flexi even he is alone !,btohqsg

Hi guys  need some advice. What‚Äôs your take on this? Farrer Park Fields Kallang Whampoa 4-rooms  or Tengah Waterfront 5 rooms ?,btohqsg
depends on whether u like the location ?,btohqsg
Like town area more  you but consider Tengah bcus it is cheaper   got parent grants & it is 5 rooms,btohqsg
Parents grant is only for resale,btohqsg
if you have the money to afford Kallang/Whampoa then yes go for it   but if u prefer to spend lesser and go for non mature estate then Tengah it is but keep in mind it‚Äôll take a while for Tengah to be developed so there‚Äôll still be amenities that are not available nearby the estate  and its next to PIE + nearby Tengah airbase so consider well,btohqsg

Hi guys  pretty noob to this Im currently serving NS (ORD Aug this year)My spouse is a student (Graduate May this year)If we apply for BTO I understand we need to pay 5% + other fees when selecting unit? For that portion isit possible to use the grant we get when we apply for EHG or need fork out cash to pay for the fees + 5%.,btohqsg
yo  my understanding now is you guys qualify for the deferred downpayment of 5% because not working for 1 year yet  thats correct. the bulk of other fees are stamp duty  which depends on the price of the house you're paying for. Because you guys are eligible for the deferment  you guys don't get grant. Grant is only for couples where at least 1 person has worked for a year (sorry  ns doesnt count)* So yes  whatever your cpf can't cover  cash will have to be forked out,btohqsg
Not possible as you as a couple will be considered under Deferred Income Assessment. As a result of DIA  your EHG and HLE will only be assessed about 3 months before key collection.,btohqsg
Are either one of you under 30?,btohqsg
AHHHH i seeSo when apply btoApply for deferred income assessmentFork out the 5% for downpayment plus stamp duty n other fees then 3 months before key collection get hle n ehg assessment?,btohqsg
no needa apply for deferred income assessment  it's auto!,btohqsg
they may want you to provide your 11b and ur partner's uni letter is all,btohqsg
I see okok swee! Thankyouu! Finally understand,btohqsg
Ok so you are automatically under Deferred Income Assessment. As you are under 30  you're eligible for Staggered downpayment scheme.Hence you will need to pay the following:,btohqsg
Yes hehe ok me will read,btohqsg
If cannot I will copy and paste again,btohqsg
Thankyou very much both of u üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg

If we bought a resale flat with only (proximity grant) then we sell it and buy a bto does it count as second time buyer? Is there a 1st time buyer grant?,btohqsg
Seems like you will be classified as a second timer and you will need to pay a resale levy.Since EHG is meant for first timer families or buyers you would not be classified as a first timer  hence no grant for you.Do give HDB a call to verify though. This is based on the info I got from 99co and HDB website.,btohqsg
Flowchart above for you to check,btohqsg
I've been there all the 6 blocks has been completed n painted.The multistory carparks also painted j ready.Have u been there.Even talk to the Bangla over there they also said currently touching up all the exterior jobs.U must go there n see,btohqsg
I call hdb they say estimated time of completion is 4th quarter of 2023,btohqsg
Exactly but did u received their emails,btohqsg
Maybe around 4_5 mths will be completed I guess maybe u can go there n see,btohqsg
Oh I see... this place u got is during BTO exercises or SBF,btohqsg
hi if anyone can advice  if we are first timers  combined income below $14k. if we buy resale near either parents house  we would be eligible for1. Family Grant2. Family Grant (first timer)3. EHG Family Grant4. PHGAre the grants stackable? Also  would it be all 4  or only 2-4?,btohqsg
I think you need to look specifically at each grant. Some might not apply to your situation... Do check HDB website for clarification,btohqsg
Hello  HLE is required before i go for flat booking correct? A friend of mine die2 say it‚Äôs not needed you can just go ahead and book a flat without it so i‚Äôm a little confused now,btohqsg
When in doubt  call up HDB,btohqsg
It‚Äôs required for HDB to assess whether you‚Äôre eligible for a loan during the booking of flat  last time maybe they close eye dont have HLE still okay  now maybe not.but then again if ur HLE is still processing  you can still book a flat  HDB officer will do the HLE on the spot with you  as long as you got apply for HLE,btohqsg
hello everyone  so we applied for HLE and alr book a flat for BMR but my HLE status is still this  can someone confirm with me if i am looking at the right place?,btohqsg
As in your HLE not approved yet? When is your second appointment?,btohqsg
second appointment is like quite a while ago,btohqsg
Just want to check  we only need the HLE for the first appointment to book the flat right? After that the second appointment is just going down to pay the downpayment and the other fees  we won‚Äôt need the HLE again until key collection?,btohqsg
Huh? Second appointment means signing of lease agreement.,btohqsg
then its booking of flat only,btohqsg
like we went down to select flat and make options payments,btohqsg
Then just wait until they call you for second appointment. If by then still not approved then you can try asking HDB.,btohqsg
If you are eligible for EHG  it will also be disbursed to you before your second appointment.,btohqsg
u have q number for Farrer Park Fields and Tengah Waterfront?strange to have q number for more than 1 BTO,btohqsg

the new rules in August BTO 2023 is coming in,btohqsg

anyway this applicant seems not decided on where location to stay?applicant applied for mature location (KALLANG) and non mature location (TENGAH)both choices at the different end of spectrum (diff price  diff location  diff size....)advice is that you need to discuss openly with your husband/wifeit is good that u have 2 q number for bothstill got time to consider carefully,btohqsg
most people would choose mature location  for its convenience and many good amenities nearby and others good points etcBut hey  Tengah is more affordable and it is a new concept town and it is quietreally depends on where u like it? how much u can afford?need to factor in the future primary school for the kids,btohqsg
it is a good moveimagine 40% drop out rate for BTOs   very highthere are people who really need BTOs but missed the chance to choose,btohqsg
esp because i‚Äôm one of those who really need BTO ü´†ü´†,btohqsg

Guys.. im curious... for the balance purchase price of thr hse that we need to pay when collect right? Can pay using cpf for the whole amt or got cap? Lets say its 190k balance price,btohqsg
U need to pay everything when u get keys,btohqsg
Can pay using CPF. If got shortfall even after using CPF and loan  then need to pay in cash.,btohqsg
Cashier order n cash both can,btohqsg
sorry actually cashier's order how it works for HDB?example  i still owed HDB $50 000 after deducting loan and depleted CPF accounts for payment at the 3rd appointment stage (key collection)the procedures for cashier order is as below?1) Go to your bank (DBS example) to ask for cashier order- I tell DBS that I need a cashier order of $50 000 to be issued to HDB for payment- DBS then will give u a cashier order(look like a cheque)  for the $50 000 to be credited to HDB only*** At this stage immedately after DBS give me cashier order  my bank account will be deducted $100 000 right?2) During the actual 3rd appointment (key collection)  I pass the $50 000 cashier order to HDB3) This cashier order can only be collected by HDB right?If i lost this cashier order along the way  anyone pick up cannot credit to their personal bank account right? Since the cashier order is written for payment to HDB only?sorry i am confused,btohqsg
Both a cashier's order and cheque are written documents that serve the purpose for transferring money. The main difference lies in the fact that a cashier's order is guaranteed not to bounce  since the money has already been retrieved from the payer's account when it is issued.,btohqsg
Why will be deducted 100k if you issue 50k cashier's order?,btohqsg
sorry type error just assume all amount = $50 000,btohqsg
