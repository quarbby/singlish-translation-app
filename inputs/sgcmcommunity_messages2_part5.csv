Oh dang  wife does not really like the bar beside the driver seat in Avante. üòÇ,btohqsg
In practical usage  has anyone encountered any inconvenience in an Avante due to the bar as such?,btohqsg
Honestly no. I‚Äôm a owner myself currently for this car.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not really that high at most 2-3 above your thigh,btohqsg
Mazda 3 and avante basically hp n nm not much different but I find avante the new one has better interior. If u talk about better pick up n acceleration then Skoda alr,btohqsg
So is what u looking for? Price   stop the. Pick up fast? Or high hp,btohqsg
New avante new bar very hard to touch girlfriend leg,btohqsg
So if u r the kind driving left hand cannot keep to your side need to touch the girl beside get mazda 3,btohqsg
true both have similar numbers but their 0-100 is slightly more than 1 second difference according to web.. prob due to avante being lighter in weight,btohqsg
Anyone driving a Skoda Superb here? Can share real life experience? üòÅ,btohqsg
Anyone wants to buy Mk2 superb 2.0 to try and then renew coe? 1 owner.,btohqsg
The Mazda 3 rear legroom is quite sad. If your rear passengers above 1.5m then will be uncomfortable,btohqsg
Not many in sg.https://www.facebook.com/groups/skodasg/?ref=shareCan try join this grp and ask haha,btohqsg
I think Vezel leg room is better than Mazda 3. I am 1.82m and there is ample rear leg room for me. The driver was abt 1.7m height.,btohqsg
Skoda looks nice. Basically VW Golf Platform.Not sure about maintenance cost since I heard horror stories of high prices for VW DSG gearbox repairs.,btohqsg
My friend once had a VW Passat  on the 4th year  he literally had to top up engine oil every week. But there are no of anomalies. No faults  nothing. He sold it eventually.,btohqsg
Vw has improved their dsg over the years. Lesser problems n more reliable.Main issues are with drivers that drives a dsg gearbox like a cvt that result in unwanted/higher wear n tear,btohqsg
Drive and own for yourself  don't hearsay.,btohqsg
What do you mean drive a DSG like a CVT gearbox? I am not familiar with these gearboxes...üòÅ,btohqsg
Just gearbox that works different loh.Driving a dsg car  dont always creep Ur car. Stop means stop  move means move.Alot people bad habit let go brake and let it creep abit and repeat. Bad for e gearbox but haters will say its meant to be used like any other car/abuse,btohqsg
Cos dsg upshift super quickly  have to notice the rpm Shifts also during acceleration. I dont let it stay inbetween shift too long. Like u know its gonna upshift into next gear but it hasnt cos u havent accelerate that little Bit more.. idk just my own assumptions.Can see uncle khong‚Äôs advice on youtubehttps://youtu.be/ymI9FbTDfG0,btohqsg
if you trust what VW says la haha  if so the newer dsg shd be ok,btohqsg
Vw say newer dsg200wetdry clutch comes with mineral oil inside  so its not fully dry.,btohqsg
dq200 no wet leh is dry,btohqsg
oh u mean like nt fully dry,btohqsg
Ya. Like a hybrid dry kind. Idk la. They n their sales gimmick i feel,btohqsg
hahaha yeah. im using dq200 now also  if skoda superb shd be DQ381 wet clutch so less worry,btohqsg
Superb is 2.0 so shldnt be dq200,btohqsg
"I'll miss the feeling of gear change when EV has ""conquered it all"".",btohqsg
Ev is flat spot right. No gear shift  no clutch throw torque etc.. like bluesg but more powerful,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36H9BVeMYMIif you have 5 minutes to spare. can have gear change but no real benefits in having them unless proper racing,btohqsg
