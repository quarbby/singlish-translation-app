Erm how long you hover at each post also goes into their algorithm!,btohqsg
3 months with you the car is going to look very different,btohqsg
I doubt the civic rules globally though,btohqsg
In every other rap video or behind every influencer in LA or London,btohqsg
Surprised the G-wagon didn't make it,btohqsg
But I guess the jeep and range are there to compensate,btohqsg
Ikr! That’s why my page is full of history and culture topics.,btohqsg

"""Ms Jenny Lim  head of BlueSG’s Singapore office  told TODAY in a video interview that there were “internal damages to the car  mounting up to the engine level”  none of which would be outwardly visible.""Anyone spotted something? 🤣https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/bluesg-complaint-repair-bill-car-damaged-let-stranger-drive-2009916Some good laughs this morning.I know Parallel Parking can be hard but unable to parallel park a BLUESG?! 👻",btohqsg
Cos it is so short in body length,btohqsg
Nobody complain about Car sharing user being cheap  where got such thing as cheap drive with no risk,btohqsg
Timely reminder to bluesg  getgo hirers. Frequently see them flooring the accelerator like there’s no tomorrow.,btohqsg
Exactly. Same with buying cars  can't drive don't drive simple logic,btohqsg
Infrequent drivers yet drive like professional racers.,btohqsg
Thats what happen when you are charged per minute block..or per 15 mins?I am really skeptical of rental cars. The tyres are usually not in the best condition.,btohqsg
For some folks  they need to learn it the hard way. Just hope they don’t hurt themselves or worse others in the process.,btohqsg
Actually ah  after watching F1 and see how the driver reacts when the F1 is just slipping a bit  It just amazed me how precise they are; connected as 1 with their machine,btohqsg
I would think car sharing users mostly new or inexperiencedMajority would both chap just because it's not their carBut this bluesg incident scary leh  when renting the car who could tell there's internal damagesSo either the user bs or simply sueh to trigger bluesg to check the car,btohqsg

Less than 5% of the cars on the road probably even need that grip 😂,btohqsg
Not going to lie  it looks almost the same as PS4S threads.,btohqsg
At the speed some cars drive on bad tyres..esp in the wet. MAYBE,btohqsg
We come back to the age old argument of car Vs driver,btohqsg
caught max slightly counter steering here!!,btohqsg
its really amazing considering how low they sit and how much they can see,btohqsg
Takes a ridiculous amount of time  practice and balls to do this really.,btohqsg
I’ve always said  you need to learn  but really…learn in the right environment. Want to drive fast? Go do it on the track.,btohqsg
Driving to the Suntec City area that night I have my ball shrink as well 😱It was pouring so heavily that I am regretting lol,btohqsg
Hi guys  if i planning to transfer the car ownership to my fiancee  will it affect the bank loan?,btohqsg
because we aren't official married yet  so i cant buy season parking at her carpark,btohqsg
Yes and it will affect transfer as well,btohqsg
Hdb parking u don’t need to be married. Just use her sing pass to buy,btohqsg
You don’t need to transfer ownership  just have her buy the season parking?,btohqsg
cant thou  they dont allow because shes not the owner of the car,btohqsg
1. Yes2. It will also affect the transfer count of the car3. Now refinancing interest may not be viable due to raising interest rates,btohqsg
not owner still can buy  but shorter period  up to 3 months max,btohqsg
maybe the CP slot full liao. Cos priority goes to those who live in the area.,btohqsg
I think the best way is to change your NRIC address by having a bill to your name sent to the address. Then u can buy the Season in the priority list.,btohqsg
maybe ah considering they on 3rd priority since its not owner of the car buying,btohqsg
Thanks for the information  I will try and get her to get the season parking  if fail then probably have to change my NRIC address?,btohqsg
oh btw  i think u need wait till 21st for her to try again cus its P3,btohqsg
Anyone can give review on the 2 cameras or use both of them before Blackvue 590x vs Iroad x9/x11? Their price around the same though. I use both of them before but was years back.. Currently looking at this 2 brands only..,btohqsg
Neither. Why spend so much when you can get much cheaper ones for the same quality?,btohqsg
