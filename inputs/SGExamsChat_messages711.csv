If u watch the jerome guy on tiktok,btohqsg
i saw some YP get a tattoo with the new CCKSS pe shirt,btohqsg
For east is bedok town and changkat changi,btohqsg
look at teck whye last time,btohqsg
legitimately do YPs/XMMs have attire that at least doesn't incriminate themselves when they do stupid shit,btohqsg
YPs and xmms now so common bruh,btohqsg
it was siglap sec and coral sec,btohqsg
but wow choa chu kang sec's full uniform is just polo tee,btohqsg
loyang view was greenview sec and loyang sec,btohqsg
they don't have the full button shirt,btohqsg
I rmb bedok was known for bedok town,btohqsg
bedok got alot of sec schs,btohqsg
Now only bedok view bedok south last man standing,btohqsg
Sec 4  taking o levels this year,btohqsg
this schs nvr merged b4 ah?,btohqsg
ltr another few more yrs they will merge both schs tgt,btohqsg
South is good view is just okok,btohqsg
at this rate i imagine how it wld be like if nj merge with hwachong,btohqsg
why all the discord ppl come here,btohqsg
is a sch is also a hotel,btohqsg
they not merging  JCs with history,btohqsg
you see all the JCs that got merged are the newer jcs,btohqsg
hwachong  raffles  not gonna get merged,btohqsg
the 2 JCs culture too different,btohqsg
imagine all these jc's tht got merged they merge it again,btohqsg
merged sch merged with another sch,btohqsg
got alot of this kind of schs,btohqsg
i think the ip jcs are not gonna get merged because that will cause some issuesso that leaves us with nyjc  sajc  acjc  cjc  asrjc  jpjc  tmjc  yijc,btohqsg
out of all these  asr jp yi tm r alr merged schs,btohqsg
both christian founded schs with party culture,btohqsg
imagine a merger with cjc acjc sajc,btohqsg
Do you guys think there's gonna be another full IP school in sg ever again or not,btohqsg
cjc idk. cuz got affiliated schs,btohqsg
my friend said IP should be 3 +3 instead of 4+2,btohqsg
Singapore is at the equator so no 4 seasons,btohqsg
affiliated sch is another issue yeah,btohqsg
Yea I think that's why MOE made the two full IP schools accept JAE students while merging JAE only JCs,btohqsg
i am pretty sure there are more,btohqsg
Ntu selectively…i heard fr my friend a lot of ppl got 100% for a math paper coz there is no bell curve,btohqsg
Maybe she is here again too,btohqsg
I heard my friend from the ancient era (and siyan) say that last time when dhs was just iporientation was like 2 daysyour entire class is in 1 houselesson pacing was quite fast and they apparently either don't reteach stuff taught in y3y4 or they briefly go through,btohqsg
Now basically gg if u 13 or higher coz only jp / yi welcomes u,btohqsg
wasn't hcjc always open to JAE students and tjc too?,btohqsg
in fact tjc is minority ip,btohqsg
it started off as jc  not sec sch,btohqsg
Are they currently also accepting JAE?,btohqsg
while the 2 full IP are the one that started as high sch,btohqsg
tjc and njc is minority IP i think,btohqsg
there were only 2 that were always full ip,btohqsg
yea but we were talking about full ip,btohqsg
i keep on confusing temasek jc and temesek sec,btohqsg
Merger of meridian and tampines had the most conflict which explains for more merger at least the first few yrs,btohqsg
tmjc is the best merged jc obv (asrjc doesn't exist),btohqsg
Anyway@polarbearnextdoordo you think MOE will remove IP in the far futuresomeone told me they aren't removing it for now but the future no one knows,btohqsg
they haven't even had their first CA,btohqsg
@habibi5201TMJC is IP to sch 5,btohqsg
so like if i  go yijc no chance score 90rp ah,btohqsg
I was fr the batch that saw their shit,btohqsg
isn't there the solomon guy or smt,btohqsg
Cause now IP can dae to polys mah,btohqsg
Tm is the 2nd by results  worst by how it went,btohqsg
solomon is the first 90RP in yi,btohqsg
Oh so like example IP cedar can go to hcjc ?,btohqsg
i rmb there was alot of conflict abt ms yoong,btohqsg
I heard that there were a lot of shit talking on reddit,btohqsg
Every sch is a good school !!!!!!!!!,btohqsg
cuz i know jc the department play a part but like idk how bad yijc is also,btohqsg
I saw their mess  the teachers didnt even get along and it is damn fked up coz most of the teachers AND SCH LEADERS were fr tampines so it calls for trouble la,btohqsg
There's some acsi guy in my sch (JAE) taking french my friend say he is cracked at acads,btohqsg
only ms pang was from mjc right,btohqsg
Mr lim yew wei also fr MJ,btohqsg

He can be v fierce but also joke ard with me,btohqsg
"yk one of the tactics my ex tuition principal used to convince my mom was "" matcha can do well in o levels even if she goes to express stream so you should let her go""",btohqsg
ironically on reddit i heard more nasty shit abt yi than mi,btohqsg
He only taught me for 2 weeks lol,btohqsg
I cant rmb if mdm sze was fr MJ but mr lim yew wei was fr MJ,btohqsg
Me and my friend snuck to Phys lect b4,btohqsg
apparently now yijc is the new ite north,btohqsg
I think my batch mr lim yew wei first time come teach h1,btohqsg
because MI is only 6/month and higher chance of going local uni,btohqsg
Cuz we legit tryna learn 💀,btohqsg
that's what little miss appendictis said,btohqsg
He v nice to me idk why  coz he only taught me for 2 weeks then become like he know me v well lol and joke w me,btohqsg
Btw it's during Nov lect we nvr pon anyth,btohqsg
@habibi5201dyt I can get raw 6 for o levels if I took,btohqsg
"i told her abt rp she said ""nah rp better""",btohqsg
so is going to SP poly better than going yijc if uw go uni in the end,btohqsg
Tbh TM chers damn chill abt ppl sneaking to diff subjs for Nov lect period on,btohqsg
Is more like U wasting Ur time situation aha,btohqsg
yea actl you're right  i'm glad i chose ip,btohqsg
Even though he probably saw me before at the late coming scanning,btohqsg
he's inactive bc he's touching grass,btohqsg
Or are you one of the banned users,btohqsg
I hv not met a v fierce teacher except dephine,btohqsg
@elementriidoes kenhel still think ur name is ryan,btohqsg
I have a bit of free time to chat,btohqsg
did kenhel in general say anyth abt mw,btohqsg
But it wasn’t a practice back then,btohqsg
I went outside every single day during this March holidays,btohqsg
my physics tutor is the opposite of fierce,btohqsg
The chers i know that can be fierce are somehow nice to me,btohqsg
I got to talk to some real CEOs at some business networking event,btohqsg
i went to library 3/5 days,btohqsg
because of topic that starts with v,btohqsg
There is this geog cher Tan Yong Hao iirc that likes to shit talk his students,btohqsg
I'm prob gonna go library on like every Sunday,btohqsg
i don't rlly like going library,btohqsg
Anyway heartware finally reached out to me for the NDP thing,btohqsg
bc of finding a seat in the first place,btohqsg
I signed up for an interview next Sunday,btohqsg
I remembered on A levels results day for the batch b4 me  he was sighing during cca and complaining to us how his class cant wake up the whole year and did shit,btohqsg
But I estimate there's gonna be like at least 500 people trying for 200 slots,btohqsg
So I don't expect to get in,btohqsg
But free interview practice is great,btohqsg
sounds like my cca instructor to the sec 3s,btohqsg
I've now got a dress shirt as well so I can put on an actual biz casual fit,btohqsg
Eh wait lemme see if i got the name wrong,btohqsg
Maybe i typed wrongly coz i think he still is the last i searched,btohqsg
apparently my pe teacher has anger issues but i thought she's very chill,btohqsg
But unfortunately (or fortunately) SAF still hasn't told me the date of my psych evaluation,btohqsg
Maybe i got the subject wrong,btohqsg
Let's just say he's the last person I expect to get accepted by Imperial,btohqsg
he's alr taking a levels for the 3rd time,btohqsg
His 6th round of national exams,btohqsg
If he legit wants to just go take uk a levels,btohqsg
If not he can forget about it,btohqsg
He could have gotten it over in 4 or 5 rounds but looks like he's going in for another rematch with the bellcurve,btohqsg
unless he lucks out and gets 90RP,btohqsg
Yo why do u look so familiar,btohqsg
I think bedok is the last person I'd expect to get a scholarship,btohqsg
Yeah no 90rp but at least uk doesn’t care,btohqsg
rmb the mikan and bedok convo,btohqsg
Like even fucking tatabusa is a better fit,btohqsg
legit how many times does bedok plan to keep going,btohqsg
You should've fking seen them when they parted ways,btohqsg
is it until he gets scholarship then he stop,btohqsg
If he serious about the UK he would have just retaken PCM,btohqsg
But I think he got denied from taking phy,btohqsg
I think this one is the last time,btohqsg
his original combi was PCMe i thought,btohqsg
actually no how can PCMe become CMEg,btohqsg
Prob wanted to flex or something,btohqsg
Didn't want to be the basic bitch,btohqsg
End up going in for round 6,btohqsg
Help my brother hogging toilet for 1h,btohqsg
like H1 econs to H2 econs,btohqsg
Idk what he does in there but it will be 30min or longer or so on the toilet bowl before he goes to bathe,btohqsg
i mean he’s never learned the syllabus past newtonian mechanics anyway,btohqsg
Coz i figure out there will be no water sound until a long time later,btohqsg
Bruh toilet not to use phone leh,btohqsg
i nvr rlly interacted with him but from what i heard he says alot of dumbass shit,btohqsg
but i know when he rejoined,btohqsg
he sent a photo of his belly/waist,btohqsg
Why are there so many TMites in SGE circles now,btohqsg
Idk something wrong w the guys in my house,btohqsg
They use toilet bring phone inside,btohqsg
lol sometimes this gc got random TM story time,btohqsg
Ok FINALLY he is out after an hour,btohqsg
half the time i enter gc will be TM discussion,btohqsg
wait its a tm guy ah,btohqsg
over here is either TM or YI story time,btohqsg
Almost everyone on SGE discord is mentally insane,btohqsg
ok ya he sent a photo of his waist,btohqsg
Sometimes in more than one aspect,btohqsg
It takes one to know one,btohqsg
sending it to a server of majority minors is another thing,btohqsg
Ok lah half of the active ppl on SGE discord are okay,btohqsg
The other half are mentally insane,btohqsg
I stayed to talk to the former half,btohqsg
half the time i enter sge discord someone is traumadumping,btohqsg
goodbye maybe its my sign to just work on my projects and geog essay instead,btohqsg
Ok tbh famoters life is pretty messed up,btohqsg
I kinda feel bad for him,btohqsg
"nobody sends the ""today at work"" copypasta anymore",btohqsg
If I met him irl I would go full on therapist mode,btohqsg
Because bro has been through a lot,btohqsg
More than anyone of that age is supposed to go through,btohqsg
actl ele have u met tatabusa before,btohqsg
who was it tatabusa met in sge,btohqsg
i'm 99.99% sure he lurks in here,btohqsg
Okay let's hope he didn't see that then,btohqsg
Is bedok still active in this tele,btohqsg
the person he doxxed deleted their account anw,btohqsg
how long is his mute sia,btohqsg
i find joy in laughing at these kinds of thing,btohqsg
i didnt see what happen so no commento,btohqsg
I forgot what was his first subject combi?,btohqsg
But yeah better to retake stuff you familiar with,btohqsg
deleted or changed name and leave grp?,btohqsg
So CMEg is the 2nd one alr,btohqsg
he never took P for a levels,btohqsg
So the first change was at the start,btohqsg
PCMe > CMEg > CFME (4H2s),btohqsg
Just focus on taking 3H2 and acing them,btohqsg
Think of those 1 in 10 acceptance rates,btohqsg
Everyone focuses on the 1 but the 9 who got rejected must have felt pretty defeated after,btohqsg
All the pedos moving to Japan now,btohqsg
Maybe they think they can escape consequences,btohqsg
prussia also considering a career in japan iirc,btohqsg
people have said it extensively trust me,btohqsg
my highest is 69 on monkeytype help,btohqsg
I’m not a gamer I just typed a lot of stuff,btohqsg
how are you guys so free to talk every second,btohqsg
you guys dont have homework or something?,btohqsg
in pri sch i was typing with 1 finger💀,btohqsg
just dont bother backreading the unread messages,btohqsg
my cher said it was cute💀💀💀,btohqsg
my pri sch taught us to touch type,btohqsg
i mean mine also lah. js nvr got the hang of it,btohqsg
was rlly fun to me so i kept doing it,btohqsg
last time always play typeracer when bored LOL,btohqsg
oh I used to play those typing keyboard games,btohqsg
he always wanted fmaths and chem but tmjc denied what,btohqsg
hes the one that today at work copypasta,btohqsg
Today at workI wasn’t paying attention and I looked at my phone for a bitI got scolded by the manager saying if I looked at it again he will make me go homeI took it as a threat and I had thought of 7 ways to murder himUnfortunately because of that I had extreme difficulty trying to focus on anything and when I tried to bring myself back I kept hyperventilatingLater when he asked me if I even knew what I’m doing I took it as offensive and I snapped at him  I shouted at him saying how I would like to murder him and how him threatening to send me home is an offence to my mindset and my attitudeHe scolded me for doing that but to be honest it felt good to snap at him and shout how I would hurt him even if he insisted he has normal hearingHe made me go clean the screens of the demo devices littered around the store but I don’t think I feel bad for basically telling him a death threatFirst my lit teacherThen I target my classmatesThen I told my class I wanted to murder my math teacher on the same day of the River Valley axe incidentThen I told a manager of challenger that he should die from my handsThen I scolded a promoter for taking my customer a few days ago(He was a shitty promoter who said misinformation)Is it bad I imagine things in my mind about killing people very quickly and with precise instructions such as head butting them first onto the floor and chewing off their ear  or smacking them senselessly in the head with a metal water bottleAnd if it is bad  why is it I feel happy about the day I finally break and murder someonewould it have been funny if instead of trying to kill myself when i was 11I strangled my bully with rope insteadi made this does this mean i'm schizophrenic because I have no control over my mindit stopped raining outside maybe i can skid and dieI'm being too obsessive that a community I don't like yet is in doesn't care about me,btohqsg
He wrote the pieces of it and ppl compiled into copypasta,btohqsg
Japan is not really that good to move to,btohqsg
i feel like ppl on sge discord idealise japan,btohqsg
even roy who is living in japan acknowledge japans flaws,btohqsg
Then got some ppl who are obsessed with japan,btohqsg
You'll probably get worked to death by your local 珠式会社,btohqsg
if i’m gonna move to anywhere it won’t be within Asia lol,btohqsg
I believe you won't face xenophobia if you are Chinese and can integrate well,btohqsg
But there's still many things to consider,btohqsg
how do you idolise a country,btohqsg
He knows better than everyone else because he actually lived there,btohqsg
But for Roy the situation was right for him to have a somewhat good life and career in Japan,btohqsg
My mother's side uncle lives in Tokyo and even though he has lived there for a long time and has kids he's still not a citizen yet,btohqsg
idk lah  I thought some people really fantasise about certain countries,btohqsg
I hope you don't see the RCTA cancer on tiktok,btohqsg
Some citizenship are hard to get,btohqsg
Even USA their citizenship not easy to get but at least they are still open to immigration for now,btohqsg
But I believe you should only seriously consider moving to Japan if you actually see yourself having a good career and personal life there and know what you're in for,btohqsg
Don't go there for the anime and jpop,btohqsg
It's nice but it shldnt be the only reason bruh....,btohqsg
What are your views on Tata after his criminal incident,btohqsg
No I need a j2 perspective,btohqsg
oh good. shld be made into a fanfiction,btohqsg
Leave that for the discord pls,btohqsg
At least u never see him irl,btohqsg
Got some talking abt my classmates eh,btohqsg
U want me add him in here arh?,btohqsg
Bro yall just explored the discord lore,btohqsg
who are you on the discord,btohqsg
Technically I predate both discord existent I here before that,btohqsg
no its in the tele home page  the chat got numbers,btohqsg
what tf are you guys even talking about anyway,btohqsg
the other day i got 1000+,btohqsg
I was here since sstb was created,btohqsg
ummm RP disc lore schools(?) thn idk alr,btohqsg
Do I count as a veteran?,btohqsg
Only RP students and former students can do that,btohqsg
I still have this f'ing sticker,btohqsg
Bruh it's a rp past time,btohqsg
Tata always got criminal incident one,btohqsg
What does this NPee student say,btohqsg
Dw just always know rp is the soft underbelly of poly,btohqsg
okay iʼm off to do some studying i donʼt want to be involved in whatever this thing is about,btohqsg
im too introverted to care about whats up in my school  like i mentioned a few days? back,btohqsg
im just here because im pretty bored sometimes,btohqsg
RP is always like that lmao,btohqsg
Apparantly there's alot for this yr j1 batch alr,btohqsg
It ain't isolated to just RP,btohqsg
hi guys how was noi finals?,btohqsg
RP maybe lower a bit la but still SOI ain't indicative of anything lmao,btohqsg
Oh yes did your faci anything about discontinuing modules,btohqsg
It's the school with the most ppl,btohqsg
Of higher o levels and ite scores,btohqsg
Yeah u are taking bias stats bro,btohqsg
Bro the cyber security intake for soi is 26,btohqsg
The most desired soi module in rp has the same intake scores of the common course of soi,btohqsg
Didn't yall meet up like 10 times,btohqsg
Bro was probably like 1 step away from recruiting you into his personal mlm scheme,btohqsg
SOI and SEG is the dumping ground ngl,btohqsg
Apparently he was stalking me for a bit,btohqsg
Idk what you mean by bias when Alot of ppl know in rp. Soi is like a whole diff school in itself,btohqsg
Tata is that type of person,btohqsg
Except the financial gurus only have 1 criminal record,btohqsg
The better schools are probably SAS and SMC,btohqsg
Eh Orpheus why you ignoring me,btohqsg
You sign NDA with Tata ah,btohqsg
Bruh 26 is damn high and they basically accept anyone basically,btohqsg
If he's stalking this channel he's probably like not smart enough to figure out what's going on anyway,btohqsg
Should be quite easy to spot,btohqsg
Why u so obsessed with Tata,btohqsg
Na Ele is just a kaypoh kid,btohqsg
yeah 26 nett r4 is horrible,btohqsg
Yeah wtf are u expecting they didn't include the course GPA average but I guarantee you it ain't good,btohqsg
if you put in some effort i guarantee you wouldnʼt be scoring straight Cs,btohqsg
and you would actually get better than that,btohqsg
unless you are really the person that can operate on hands on learning  then thats another story,btohqsg
In the past 1 week Spotify has stopped giving me ads even tho I don't have premium,btohqsg
You just downloaded the app? Same thing happened to me it was like they forgot about it lol  until aft like 2 or 3 weeks,btohqsg
isnʼt the whole of sg obsessed with japan and south korea,btohqsg
that shouldnt just be limited to a social media platform,btohqsg
I downloaded a long time ago,btohqsg
No you aren’t  it’s true  speaking from anecdotal experience,btohqsg
no? a lot of my classmates are in love with anime,btohqsg
having japanese characters as their pfps is common place here,btohqsg
whole of sgis an absolute term,btohqsg
is either that or they give u free premuium as trial,btohqsg
i heard south korea is hella sexist. not sure if thats true or not,btohqsg
No it still says free account,btohqsg
i consider it as a yes,btohqsg
both japan and south korea treat women poorly,btohqsg
no like they give u trial for premium,btohqsg
is still free acct cuz u cant download,btohqsg
look at weibo before u say this,btohqsg
to be fair the only reason i would never move to japan or south korea is because1. i dont speak their language2. south korea is near a country thats tasting nukes every year3. japan has natural disasters yearly4. COL isnt very good there. heard their COL is high,btohqsg
and overall... just not a big fan of their culture really,btohqsg
Do people want to move to Japan because they think it’s like anime? Loll,btohqsg
its funny if you want to move overseas because of that,btohqsg
rather than good job opportunities  good standard of living  easy to get a job and citizenship,btohqsg
China is good if you can carve out a specific niche where you enter a relatively well paying career and live in one of the nicer cities,btohqsg
The government regulations are kind of shit,btohqsg
But if you earn well and live in a good area it's the same as living in a first world country,btohqsg
Just don't move to rural Henan and expect to become rich,btohqsg
If Jiangsu were a country it would be considered a developed country,btohqsg
But not all of China is that rich,btohqsg
It's near to HK if you want to get out and experience western comforts,btohqsg
And there's lots of opportunities for tech ppl,btohqsg
But ofc that's if you think it's the right move,btohqsg
isnt china a country with a mixed economy  not fully socialist and not fully capitalist,btohqsg
Don't just anyhow want to move to other country with no clear reason why,btohqsg
I mean do u really expect someone to buck up after that? At the same rate of effort yields you Bs and Cs lor and RP literally leaves you alone like other polys,btohqsg
in fact china is learning from SG,btohqsg
Especially applies for those ppl who simp for Korea because kpop,btohqsg
yeah i remember reading about this!!,btohqsg
we're so cool that china is following us,btohqsg
You can't categorize China the same way you classify other countries,btohqsg
It's more like the government just does whatever they feel is good for the country (and/or whatever they feel is good for the party),btohqsg
Deng xiaoping is learning from SG after visiting.（）,btohqsg
U go Japan Korea China or any area for that matter looking to get your next gf or bf is the dumbest mindset,btohqsg
The best place to live is like,btohqsg
Okay not Sweden they're shit now,btohqsg
Norway is as close to a utopia as it gets,btohqsg
You rarely hear about their problems,btohqsg
But they rank first in like everything,btohqsg
U don't get the same support system as in Secondary or JC schools,btohqsg
left leaning utopia vs right leaning utopia is q different,btohqsg
Heck I tried to schedule a consult with my lecturer once and got told she gets paid by the hour,btohqsg
i heard they have the highest HDI of any country,btohqsg
Western European style mixed capitalist socialist utopia,btohqsg
They are ranked first in evrrything as well,btohqsg
who said i simp for u,btohqsg
@Chaeyeonsanaeh you lucky I don't take things seriously,btohqsg
If you act weird weird to the wrong person someone's going to pull another Mirai on you ah,btohqsg
Already pissed off the entire discord with that one,btohqsg
Bro I know it's you bitch,btohqsg
Someome probably took a screenshot of that,btohqsg
And would use it against you out of context,btohqsg
Because some people are like that,btohqsg
That's a risk I am willing to take,btohqsg
its that top notch US uni,btohqsg
Top notch at shitty currency valuation,btohqsg
I think we had this convo before,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdmAAEL2WyAthis guy cant be serious...bro i hope i dont kenna this kind of ppl in my army days,btohqsg
Doesn't matter tbh they don't recognise most of the US universities either ways,btohqsg
Prob cuz no MIT doktor would come to Singapore,btohqsg
There's only like 3 Singaporeans in MIT every year,btohqsg
dang nah..bruh i dont film myself thats the difference..im atleast self aware of that,btohqsg
Bro they accept harvard and like Baylor Medical Colleges and John Hopkins,btohqsg
U think those ppl will come meh,btohqsg
no but the video is helpful..just dk why he tryna put on a accent,btohqsg
@Chaeyeonsanahave there been any NTU tea as of late,btohqsg
Got but its restricted to NTU ppl,btohqsg
During NTU Open house I saw the NTUSU booth got no one checking it out,btohqsg
why did you make me thirsty with that “tea”,btohqsg
Their reputation kena daamged a bit ah,btohqsg
I make a good black tea,btohqsg
good ah  the link is there,btohqsg
oh yea you tried's rp 50 cent milk tea?,btohqsg
Isit the one near RPIC there,btohqsg
If milk comes from cows then does tea come from pigs,btohqsg
i mean the 50 cents milk tea is genuine what you pay for,btohqsg
well..you have to buy a meal,btohqsg
