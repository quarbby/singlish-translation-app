well in other countries its prob worse,btohqsg
lmao who bothers to listen in philosophy,btohqsg
like ive heard of countries who have exams indirectly determining whether theyll go uni at 10 freaking years old,btohqsg
based on experience ppl use those lessons to do math and chem hw,btohqsg
Prolly only those like legit damn enthu one,btohqsg
from my ibfs (internet best friends),btohqsg
dawg do you need glasses cos you clearly need one,btohqsg
wah this guy damn smart like i never ss,btohqsg
dawg i deleted it for u u idiot,btohqsg
well they take a levels/ib as well,btohqsg
and they hv comp edu until 18 y/o,btohqsg
only at acsi and sji though,btohqsg
WHERES THE MUTE OR THE BAN,btohqsg
dawg tf is your doxxing rule,btohqsg
whats the difference between ib and a's anyway,btohqsg
besides the wacky grading system and whatnot,btohqsg
"doxxing rule on discord: BANdoxxing rule on tele: ""oh i just delete your message""",btohqsg
do u see yt talking now 😇,btohqsg
he will talk again in 1 hours time,btohqsg
ib have more coursework than a level,btohqsg
if i bet on it then obv this guy will not talk la,btohqsg
if I don't say this guy cfm will talk one,btohqsg
coursework like o/a level art sorta thing?,btohqsg
Then u bet with me on dms,btohqsg
a level is 4 content subjects + gp + pw + h1 mt (it is still counted into your AUs even if you took hmt),btohqsg
i dont know never taken coursework before,btohqsg
Until their child gets into ite then they're like: oh not tht bad,btohqsg
ib is 6 core subjects   extended essay and theory of knowledge,btohqsg
for what u left me on read for the past 14 days,btohqsg
"""U BETTER GO POLY AFTER THIS""",btohqsg
then when they go poly they want them to go jc,btohqsg
Anyway i removed fried chimken alr lool,btohqsg
wait they take 1 more subj than us?,btohqsg
personally i prefer a levels to ib because i prefer final exams to coursework but then everyone has different preferences and learning style,btohqsg
"""GO NUS MED OR U FAILURE""",btohqsg
Need to take o level then,btohqsg
No just go nus thts all LOL,btohqsg
more like oxbridge or ivy league,btohqsg
What if i go ntu med then how,btohqsg
i dont want to go America though,btohqsg
I got friend friend gg cambridge med,btohqsg
i heard sg alevels content and paper is slightly more difficult but take with grain of salt,btohqsg
skill issue why never go mit,btohqsg
got a lot of school shootings,btohqsg
Bros becoming the next ali abdaal,btohqsg
in sg a levels ur competing with ip kids. in ib ur competing with other country slackers from what i heard,btohqsg
n i heard that sg alw tops the ib exam,btohqsg
sg alevels is more indepth than uk alvls while uk alvls more broad,btohqsg
what if... i am the ip kid 🤯,btohqsg
what abt h3 math n h2 fm,btohqsg
I rather compete w sg kids lol,btohqsg
whats the diff between these 2 by the way,btohqsg
at least gp is not rigged against me,btohqsg
but yea i saw on r/ibo that alot ppl happy with 32/45,btohqsg
that sounds like a dogshit score no offense,btohqsg
h2 fmath  is more applied maths while h3 math is more pure maths (eg. number theory),btohqsg
idk if you can even go anywhere,btohqsg
I found out birmingham med needs a score of 32,btohqsg
i think some overseas uni ? idk i dont do ib,btohqsg
iknow of someone who screwed alevels cannot go local uni so the rich parent sent them overseas,btohqsg
rich parents alr send to international sch lo,btohqsg
that was my sec sch classmates for o levels,btohqsg
it was some like australia uni,btohqsg
Too bad i don't have rich parents,btohqsg
I got ri friends who dropped out of ri jc to go uk,btohqsg
acsi is the most p2w sch  your chances of appealing into the sch increases based on how much money you have,btohqsg
like theyre both smart and have money,btohqsg
isnt their % of students entering oxbridge higher than any other jc except for hc,btohqsg
ya  rich friend appealed into acsi,btohqsg
I heard one guy paid 20k to return,btohqsg
i rmb their class of 2023 1 in 3 90rp  hc is 1 in 4 90rp,btohqsg
i went to his house before,btohqsg
my friend who was from acsb went to acsi in y2 and went ib in y3,btohqsg
and he's loaded with money  his mum knows the principal aswell,btohqsg
thing is he's not even that academically gifted,btohqsg
told my parents abt this. they just went “wah so 厉害”,btohqsg
If he did decently well for entrance y3 xams then,btohqsg
he's like your average express student,btohqsg
foul play alr la  mum convinced principal with money,btohqsg
can't be a coincidence that 99% of ib people are rich right,btohqsg
Idk anyone who dont know what acs is,btohqsg
but arent there lots of other schs whom most people know abt,btohqsg
like chij mgs nygh ri rgs hc nanchiau nanhua,btohqsg
i had a friend acsb then trf to acsi in sec 2 then trf to ip in y3 into the gifted class,btohqsg
Chij rgs and nygh was popular back in pri sch,btohqsg
But acs was popular for the wrong reasons like when i was sec 2 sec 3,btohqsg
cat high ip ppl gg to cjc 💀💀💀💀,btohqsg
i did lots of sngs prac papers in primary school  my classmates alw tslked abt how good that sch was,btohqsg
I didnt know cat high was a good sch eh,btohqsg
Cat high ip i dun think it is cjc,btohqsg
Cat high scgs and sngs go to ej,btohqsg
ej got how many affiliated schs sia,btohqsg
bro all my classmates say they go cjc 💀💀💀,btohqsg
Im a genius who did ok for tdy despite not studying🤣🤣,btohqsg
I tot i would flunk it,btohqsg
But imagine nth to say then stare blank at examiner for 8min,btohqsg
i thought syllabus code different tho? but qns for both the same ah? probably they can toughen it by removing mcqs and making the format more similar to o level humanities,btohqsg
Speaking of which i dk how i got A,btohqsg
how big is the gap between h2 econs and o level econs,btohqsg
Is asus lenovo or hp better for laptops,btohqsg
Yeah but same paper. If you took before you can try to find your year. However there’s 2 different versions per exam cycle presumably for ppl in diff time zones  Singapore only uses one of the 2 for the oct/nov papers. However both versions have some similar qns hence those who took o level Econs will recall that their question paper was quarantined for one week,btohqsg
lol i also just finished my stats midterms.hopefully full marks haha,btohqsg
O level econs —> it is q a lot of content i think similar to geog (?) but the content q easy to understand  and foundation level + the qns wise is more content and less analysisH2 econs —> defo is more in depth into the analysis and the answering technique is also different compared to os where it is mainly content regurgitation. But omo hving that foundation sort of make it easier to understand the higher level stuffBUT my econs cher did mention q a lot of times (tho i cant remember what sort) that O lvl teaches some wrong things so also needa adapt to it,btohqsg
As in a level international vs Singapore  o level doesn’t have a Singapore version but I’m trying to draw some parallels. If hypothetically there was one Singapore version for o level Econs it would be more Singapore oriented,btohqsg
Applies for both o levels and a levels,btohqsg
i can alr tell that for pure bio n h2 bio,btohqsg
My tuition centre tutor once boasted if he went to the UK to provide Econs tuition for a levels  he would be comfortable guaranteeing students who don’t get an A or A* a 100% refund,btohqsg
I mean  it’s o level Econs. If more than 80% get it  so can you,btohqsg
I rmbr for 2020 I took the component 13 23 version,btohqsg
You can check the grade boundaries or other past year paper websites to know what I’m talking about  they would label the version for each paper,btohqsg
12 and 13 are paper 1s (mcq)  22 and 23 are paper are papers 2s (csq+structured/essay),btohqsg
Wait wdf did yt rly get UUUU for alvl retake,btohqsg
No i talking about A levels,btohqsg
He is trolling 90% of the time,btohqsg
I mean ya la it sounds like cap,btohqsg
how are the grades mapped to sg grades tho,btohqsg
My brother did not even get his o level cert yet  can find part time contract 3 months for 2.8k pay,btohqsg
My code did not work  hopefully method marks,btohqsg
I also dk how my brother find his 2.8k job,btohqsg
Oh i always tot it was the same paper for all countries taking the O/N/A level papers,btohqsg
"Then everyday I see him coming home early  ask him why. He say ""Nothing to do at work""",btohqsg
time to go UK to be a tutor,btohqsg
Oh i wouldnt expect a sci to be like that,btohqsg
2.8k pay per month including cpf for someone that does not even have a o level cert. Did he hit the golden spoon of jobs?,btohqsg
Wait how do u know it is 80%  i tot it was just my school,btohqsg
Granted it was available cause of the festive cny,btohqsg
As in you can see the combinations of papers available and the grade threshold for each. Moe probably decides and entirely separate grade boundary  but it might mirror the international one closely (as in if the international version grade threshold is high  moe will also set a high score and vice versa),btohqsg
I dun think they release grade boundaries tho,btohqsg
festive period i can understand for temp job,btohqsg
Bruh most of the rp lecturers have masters,btohqsg
Huh no lol. If not why would our grading system be different  and also ppl won’t be going around saying that they want to take uk a levels cos it’s easier,btohqsg
My sch also 80+% for most years,btohqsg
Not sure about the other 2 schs,btohqsg
i mean depends on the actual job,btohqsg
I’m talking about international grade boundaries,btohqsg
Moe one likely mirrors it closely,btohqsg
I got this internship at raffles hospital via school,btohqsg
My cher always tell us econs O levels is just a competition among ourselves  so i can expect the other 2 schs dun usually do well,btohqsg
Just never thought it was that high,btohqsg
Well it would be only if moe sets the grade boundaries based on student’s performance (making it similar to a bell curve although not exactly),btohqsg
But I think they only look at difficulty,btohqsg
I only remembered 1 p1 30m and 1 p2 (i forgot how many marks),btohqsg
Anyway i dun bother looking up these coz it serves no purpose,btohqsg
One of his colleague was a private diploma holder  also intern but she was paid lesser for the same job scope,btohqsg
There’s one cycle in May/june so every year got 4 versions of o level Econs international paper,btohqsg
But why now there are double??,btohqsg
We only take one of the 2 for Oct/nov,btohqsg
That’s also why I said they quarantine our papers because between both versions there will be a few identical questions,btohqsg
2 versions for ppl in diff time zones,btohqsg
Most of the qns are different but I’m guessing Cambridge doesn’t want questions to be leaked,btohqsg
I told him the fact he was paid so high very likely meant the company had very obvious office politics in play. Someone was purposely being underpaid,btohqsg
Guess what i found again…everu day new problems,btohqsg
I realised nhcs is offering places but nus put their vacancies under ‘returning scholars’,btohqsg
i got offered 1.5-1.8 base front office,btohqsg
im still using my 2021 chromebook,btohqsg
I think is this hp laptop,btohqsg
Like I use from P6 all the way to j1,btohqsg
Idw buy a new one now,btohqsg
I will just use it until after A level,btohqsg
Maybe get a new one after A Levels,btohqsg
Yea since I dont need any specific functions or what,btohqsg
But for me is cuz cca I may need some windows software anyw,btohqsg
btw valerie did you see my emo ahh post in my channel,btohqsg
how long yall normally take for paper 2 english,btohqsg
can comfortably finish in 1hr 30 tbh  but cld be cus im not in the exam condition,btohqsg
hmm probly cus not im exam condition i too lax,btohqsg
how yall get in that mood when doing practice paper at home,btohqsg
windows laptop pretty shit on a budget,btohqsg
i used to volunteer to type on my teachers' thinkpad,btohqsg
Pri sch and sec sch all my teachers use think pad,btohqsg
I'll have to pitch sth for my dad to let me,btohqsg
i all see them use dongle for hdmi i believe,btohqsg
probly gonna go with samsung tablet after Os maybe,btohqsg
ideally i shldnt be able to run games on them,btohqsg
alot of them quite shit quality ard 1k,btohqsg
ok gnna go do bio now byebye,btohqsg
but also wld like to do coding on it so dilemma,btohqsg
ye when i said that was mainly looking at ones with dedicated gpu which ideally idw,btohqsg
im wayyyy too behind on studies rn lol,btohqsg
tmr might go eh  since im oso going out to get my ic,btohqsg
tho past few days been wasting time reading bleach💀,btohqsg
back in my day ahhh commentd,btohqsg
lol i also just finished my programming quiz (yeah i had another quiz right after my stats midterms lol),btohqsg
restricted open-book. so it’s mostly just copy and paste and change variables 🤣,btohqsg
I had to run to the staffroom to get it for my teacher,btohqsg
No lets rephrase that: i was supposed to run but i strolled,btohqsg
I once got to go staff pantry,btohqsg
then my teacher offered like a drink,btohqsg
idt my teacher was supposed to ask me to go take,btohqsg
But other teachers were around ti observe so i was like why wld i steal. There r only papers,btohqsg
I had a dream abt a classmate doing tht,btohqsg
that was me before getting a double digit raw,btohqsg
a few here do  why eh,btohqsg
must be because it’s *old practices*,btohqsg
Everything is easy when ur Felicia 🔥,btohqsg
You can put your mind and become hao ren if ur matcha,btohqsg
Nah i think half the regulars here alr know my irl name,btohqsg
I think you  rand  siyan  yt have,btohqsg
I honestly regret taking on this econs mod,btohqsg
The macro lecturer is making things harder to understand by speed running the lecture,btohqsg
More math also but the theory part he speed running I legit cannot sia,btohqsg
And the macro part is quite different from A levels,btohqsg
I wonder how hard the modules are in business Econs for nus business administration,btohqsg
I considering majoring in that cos hopefully there’s less math than nus chs Econs major,btohqsg
And this is just an intro module,btohqsg
50 points is like average 20/100 in psle,btohqsg
actually i don’t think i even studied for psle  at that point in time i already gave up on myself and knew i would do shit,btohqsg
psle don't really need to study,btohqsg
I just went into the exam and took the paper as usual,btohqsg
it all comes down to practice,btohqsg
but then the concepts im not even clear with them 💀 i practice also no use,btohqsg
like 4 points away from nyghs,btohqsg
ik of ppl that retained b4 from psle but then they guai,btohqsg
Wait but what do u have to do to take HCL back in pri sch,btohqsg
I mean since you went IP  you couldn’t possibly have had any other* (sry typo) subjects with an A1 since cl and hcl were the only o level subs you sat for,btohqsg
is it normal chi do damn well,btohqsg
But damn dhs is alr very Chinese and you’re like still among the top few there in Chinese  I’m quite sure your Chinese is better than most ppl in China at this point,btohqsg
she called me senpai twice in dms 💀,btohqsg
She can be your Chinese senpai,btohqsg
But then if you took hcl also can forget about it,btohqsg
I can barely read anything here,btohqsg
Anyway if anyone knows pls enlighten me,btohqsg
difficulty is ranked as a levels < o levels < psle,btohqsg
because it is simply pay to win,btohqsg
actually all of them pay to win,btohqsg
but psle is the most pay to win,btohqsg
how many poor families do you see in ip schools,btohqsg
Btw @ ppl calling me crazy on sgediscordDon't be shy  I'm active here. Ping me here and say it to my face,btohqsg
Well I do know people in my school on FAS  and my family also doesn't have a stable source of income...But these are definitely not the majority. A lot of my friends live in condo,btohqsg
what the hell are they that pathetic..,btohqsg
Eh maybe I'm not a good person and they're telling the truth? Can't trust people you meet online haha,btohqsg
Any guys graduating from poly this year that have received their enlistment letters??,btohqsg
if by poor you just mean not paying for stuff like tuition then plenty of them,btohqsg
I was kinda insecure because of my socioeconomic status when i was in y1-y3,btohqsg
brother ive had tuition for all my subjects and i still got 177,btohqsg
must be the tuition was lousy,btohqsg
Interesting. Do grab nowadays also can easily more than 2k.,btohqsg
i mean during that time i wasn’t really interested back then and plus i didn’t understand what was going on no matter how many times you tell me,btohqsg
esp in math and sci when i was barely passing,btohqsg
doesn't mean there aren't Singaporeans who are still earning that,btohqsg
also depends on how much your parents pressure you into studying,btohqsg
ya  based on statistics  that's 2.7% of resident taxpayers.,btohqsg
ip schs don’t even affect your A levels  which is what affects your degree and career,btohqsg
wouldn’t say the tuition was lousy  but then it felt like i could’ve had better tutors that knew how to handle ppl like me,btohqsg
i mean ur the one doing a levels not the sch,btohqsg
like my tutors were tutoring ppl who usually gets A’s,btohqsg
Ok so what’s the value-add from going to an IP school lol??,btohqsg
and on that sense  there will be FAS scheme  CHAS scheme  and other stuff like U-Save  GST Vouchers  Transport vouchers to offset,btohqsg
and I wasn’t one of them,btohqsg
Helps with cost of living but still doesn’t give the “poorer” students the “pay to win” features like tuitions etc.  not saying you can’t do well without them but the playing field clearly isn’t even,btohqsg
Thrs q a few no meh,btohqsg
I’d say it becomes more “even” the higher you progress  psle is just rigged tbh,btohqsg
-more extracurricular programs (eg. Moot parliament program). Also more time to build extracurricular in Y4 due to no o levels-learn JC content in Y1-Y4 which kinda gives them a little headstart-(may vary) less spoonfeeding and more self directed earning (eg. for some math topics we watch lectures online first and then teacher goes through qn in class  which is how h2 math works in my school as all h2 math lectures are online)-have a group of friends when you enter jc  dont have to make friends all over again-more ecg programs (supposedly)-(anecdotal) ip kids adapt to jc faster than non ip kids,btohqsg
What did psle ever do to you man,btohqsg
it is never even the moment you are born,btohqsg
Only your first point is valid  the others are all meh. Even then if you’re committed you shd be able to find opportunities on your own  albeit it’s more difficult ofc,btohqsg
wish i had the brains at 12 lol,btohqsg
If it does help in some regard its alr a win or a benefit,btohqsg
fr  still waiting for it to happen to me💀,btohqsg
Value-add to academics is insignificant or can be replaced easily via alternatives if you’re willing to go the extra mile,btohqsg
So u mean to tell me,btohqsg
That the average committed o level student,btohqsg
Would go read up on a levels stuff in their free time,btohqsg
"If they ban all tuition  then I will just tuition my own kids and make them score.Then it's going to be another ""It's not even"" argument in a different way",btohqsg
Why would you have to do that? 😂,btohqsg
Study during A levels for A levels bro,btohqsg
china did try to do smth liddat?,btohqsg
Cuz that's the benefit pointed out by matcha,btohqsg
Then u said that benefit is not a benefit,btohqsg
Cuz if ur committed u will do it,btohqsg
yes  and south korea did it years earlier.The same thing happened  underground black market tuition,btohqsg
If 2k insignifcant to u  can give me ? Is very significant to me,btohqsg
Idk I'm confused ur logic not rly logicking,btohqsg
Unrelated to wtv I’m saying lmao,btohqsg
Cuz in education there's not that fixed of a barrier,btohqsg
Wasnt meaning to attack you sorry,btohqsg
I'm actually curious why u think ip schs have completely no benefit,btohqsg
That you are also interested in kurt tay,btohqsg
I scrimped and saved the moment I graduated to almost hit that amt in monthly dividends.Spending on average $600 per month upon graduation and working 70+ hours a weekBut I still lose to those who got parents help to buy a condo right after graduation  and probably made a million extra by now,btohqsg
it will never be even or fair,btohqsg
I feel like ip schls benefit people differently it's just different people cope btr in different environments,btohqsg
I mean it does give you a head start but not like you’re being tested A level content at Os lol. Sure you can argue about the content overlaps but IP kids don’t even take Os lol??? 😂,btohqsg
Ya correct but u can't deny its not a benefit in the long run because for o level students who want to go JC  they would already have lost out abit because their IP peers are more familiar with the content,btohqsg
Ur saying that students who want to go jc from o levels would be naturally committed to studying jc content so this benefit is rendered null,btohqsg
To see if your claim is true  one way would be to group people going into secondary sch based on income brackets  then from lowest to highest  see what’s the percentage of people who end up in the IP track. If in general  the percentage  gets higher for each income bracket  then your claim is probably true.,btohqsg
But then u followed up by saying that students in o levels won't study jc content?,btohqsg
So im confused cuz u kinda contradicted urself abit,btohqsg
Like since we can’t rly define poor as it’s kind of arbitrary (not like we have absolute poverty in Singapore lol)  and we don’t know how the proportion of people in each income bracket,btohqsg
I would think that  if one takes the energy and time used for complaining about unfairness  and apply it to something useful  then others will complain that you got an advantage and it's unfair for them instead.,btohqsg
"yes ""Poor"" and ""rich"" is arbritary",btohqsg
Ngl I wonder what's the general consensus towards poor and rich,btohqsg
Why not just use deciles then.,btohqsg
But I know someone who thinks 5k/month is a high salary 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Ik poor people who go for tuition,btohqsg
Cuz they wanna use it to kinda like do btr in exams,btohqsg
Or they will go for those services that provide free tuition,btohqsg
Ok imoIt is if ur living aloneBut it isnt if you have a family to feed,btohqsg
My friend offers discounted gp tuition that had the same effectiveness and distinction rate as places like Indigo and even higher than some schs,btohqsg
And all his students are from bottom to mid tier JCs which makes it more impressive (most tuition services have a high distinction rate cuz they largely accept elite sch students - classicle for instance is mainly RI dominated),btohqsg
Content wise it can finished in 1.5 yrs which is what JC does. You won’t really be missing out much since IP kids likely won’t be doing TYS for As at y4 or smth lol  even if they did they won’t remember it aft 2 years. Again this is only a disadvantage if there’s a bell curve. If not you can still score decently by going to 2 year JC,btohqsg
So ur saying that IP kids will forget whatever they learnt in secondary school completely so it won't benefit them in the future for JC?,btohqsg
Damn didn't know theres graduation amnesia,btohqsg
Ya got volunteer tutors in places like CCs  then some like proper tuition centres with owners who are actually damn kind and will subsidise (some even completely) the tuition fees for those in low income families,btohqsg
But. Is the disadvantage huggggeee??? Like would there be a 20 or 30 RP gap just because you didn’t go to IP? No really unless you decide to use this as an excuse and lament about it all day,btohqsg
The top 2 jcs in singapore are IP dominated,btohqsg
Also got those SIV where JC students tutor kids from low income family,btohqsg
Of the top 5 jcs in singapore only one is dominantly JAE,btohqsg
based on my own observation for the past many years and students  vast majority forget what they learned in y3 and y4,btohqsg
it can be admitted via jae,btohqsg
I know of at least 3 reputable Econs tuition centres that do that  Economics at Tuitiongenius (by Mr Eugene Toh)  Econs cafe (Mr Edmund Quek)  and Jc Economics tuition (by Mr Anthony Fok),btohqsg
Ig cuz im looking at my own experience in ej,btohqsg
And most of my chs friends slacked off,btohqsg
Cuz the content was taught alr in chs,btohqsg
Problem is those are part time tutors,btohqsg
Same thing I noticed in RGS to RI and HCI to HCI,btohqsg
These are like tuition centres who charge regular students at least $90/lesson and they have a good proven track record,btohqsg
Not completely  but still won’t be TYS / A level standard. I don’t think they’re grinding tys all year round which is what you sound like,btohqsg
It will never be taught at the same intensity and depth as in JC.,btohqsg
Huh I never mentioned that they're grinding tys all year round,btohqsg
the disadvantage isn't your grades or the school  but more of the character of students in an IP school Vs lower tier jcs,btohqsg
Hwachong high 400 Nygh 400 Jae 400,btohqsg
So not saying the poor can’t access tuition  even if it’s harder,btohqsg
It was the exact same content tho,btohqsg
i rmb sending a pic here of how the y3 notes just copypasted from y5 notes,btohqsg
No  it will not be. While they have some autonomy  they cannot teach A lvl stuff. It is still very MOE controlled.,btohqsg
I know of one chs ip guy psle 260+  drop to o levels  went Acjc  a levels didn’t do well,btohqsg
Quite sad cos it’s like a huge fall from grace,btohqsg
imo you need to be good with TYS if you wanna score for the actual exams. Knowing content would do little to help with a perfect score  there’s still a lot of exposure needed,btohqsg
that means they anyhow teach lor.Which means I should not recommend anyone to CHS,btohqsg
you mean they have to dumb it down?,btohqsg
Yes and this is why the 07 kids complained when nothing from tys came out,btohqsg
Cuz they went in with that mindset,btohqsg
certain things will have similar content. Eg for H2 Physics  still have Faraday's law and Lenz's lawBut the questions are very very different,btohqsg
Cuz they taught us le chatelier and Kc/Ksp/Kp,btohqsg
And it was rhe same stuff we learnt in a levels,btohqsg
oh ic. cause my sch for atomic structure the first part about orbitals (the entire part) alr learnt in y3,btohqsg
"so many students are confusing conceptual understanding vs conceptual applications.How many will think ""I understand all the concepts but can't do the questions""",btohqsg
Even stuff like hydrogen bonding and most of the atomic structure content like spdf and IE was alr taught in CHS,btohqsg
huh le chatelier not in olvl ?,btohqsg
Eh isn't IE under periodic table,btohqsg
for my sch under atomic structure,btohqsg
Idk chs taught IE under periodic table,btohqsg
The shielding effect effective nuclear charge bla bla bla,btohqsg
Which is why hearing that like ip schs can't teach a level content,btohqsg
all of that is chem bonding what,btohqsg
i want to bond with u,btohqsg
Cuz all ip schs ik of do infuse some forms of a level content,btohqsg
H2 Maths is easier to see.CHS sure teach inequalities in y3 y4  many schools do.Try inequalities at H2 level,btohqsg
My hwachong high friend say nygh and hwachong high trying to change the syllabus to make it more similar to O level,btohqsg
Yeah I was talking mainly at chem and physics tbf,btohqsg
Math doesn't deviate much in CHS cuz they still obey the amath emath split,btohqsg
So CHS taught uncertainties and projectile motion in y3? wow,btohqsg
But schs like RGS do teach the entirety of functions and transformations,btohqsg
We did projectile motion and circular motion at least,btohqsg
that one not in o level ?!!,btohqsg
You mean those with powers above 2 ah. I thought e math has inequalities but linear,btohqsg
I mean this is just my own experience,btohqsg
Actually my sch did teach the,btohqsg
I'm more interested in CHS scheme of work now,btohqsg
Method they use in h2 math,btohqsg
Like the u draw the number line,btohqsg
Then u identify positive negative regions,btohqsg
We learnt that in sec 3,btohqsg
But I think they just never tested it,btohqsg
I will look through CHS 2022 phy prelim papers,btohqsg
I guess it would’ve been manageable that’s why they taught,btohqsg
Idk what chs does now maybe times has changed since I graduated,btohqsg
I keep reading chs as college of humanities and sciences,btohqsg
when i started tutoring i was a bit surprised at what’s actually o levels lol,btohqsg
Cuz ik alot of the chers left and went to jcs to teach,btohqsg
bc i can only base it on my sch,btohqsg
Oh that one. My friend hates her,btohqsg
Eh she not bad tho back in chs,btohqsg
At least for me I could just purely listen to her and could do the paper,btohqsg
Didn't rly have to study or practice out of it,btohqsg
Interesting  the paper I have is labelled CHS (O Level Programme),btohqsg
did you learn evolution in y3 and y4,btohqsg
so the O level programme and IP Programme learn different things,btohqsg
Oh nvm I think she just scolded him for some petty reason even tho she didn’t find out the full story,btohqsg
But maybe her teaching is good,btohqsg
"ok so that day we were doing an activity where we had to identify cell organellesso like we had trouble and the teacher was like ""i give you a hint: thylakoids"" and then i was instantly like ""choloroplast ! 😆"" and the 3 jae girls in front of me were like 😯😯and teacher was like "" yall never learn in o levels?"" then they said "" yea its a new term"" then i was like"" jh got learn"" then she said ""ooh nice""",btohqsg
Oh wait junwei isit u thought that o level and ip teach the same things? Cuz its not they teach diff stuff at diff pace,btohqsg
Only the science tdp students from o level and ip would be combined tgt,btohqsg
Then they would do their own lessons (normally with jc content cuz the o level students would learn the ip stuff + more),btohqsg
Ya doesn’t make sense they learn the same stuff,btohqsg
at least for cedar  it was almost the same things,btohqsg
like how much not in o lvls,btohqsg
i think he went through but not tested,btohqsg
Evolution is in o level syllabus,btohqsg
yea ik but pob ask me,btohqsg
and DHS  NYGH  NJC IP syllabus is almost same as O lvl,btohqsg
But idk whats the direction now,btohqsg
i heard a trend for IP moving towards O Levels,btohqsg
Eh I actl only realised how many things not in O lvls after joining sge,btohqsg
i think they wanna minimise the gap,btohqsg
at least for dhs cause we started accepting jae intake in 2019then i heard rumours from a graduated senior that they removed alot of alvl contents from y3y4 syllabus because it was a bit difficult to bridge in jc (with the ip alr learnt  then is totally new to jaes),btohqsg
so they cutting back just for the jae students,btohqsg
is it the jae students complain,btohqsg
the only way around that would be to separate jae and ip into different classes,btohqsg
but that would just make things worse,btohqsg
do you want the school to get cancelled on reddit,btohqsg
EJC is one of the better JCs I think,btohqsg
very impressed with the students I have from there,btohqsg
I mean there are majority IP classes and majority JAE classes,btohqsg
But full IP and full JAE will just lead to trouble,btohqsg
my time was full IP sch so a lot of content was fr accelerated,btohqsg
If the results for IP fell since 2020 a levels then it’s quite likely the extra stuff yall learnt early was beneficial,btohqsg
thats what my friend who grad in 2018 said,btohqsg
But dhs doesn’t disclose results results for Jae students only and only ip so it’s hard to tell the fall in performance was due to Jae students or this  or both,btohqsg
That’s all? XD. All of you are taking the same A levels in Y6 or J2 not in Y5 lol 😂,btohqsg
with the speed of the chat 😂,btohqsg
i think the person got lost in the discussion,btohqsg
I think ej chem is generally still okay,btohqsg
Even the weakest of students still kinda know what they're doing,btohqsg
not the sch stuff but the student attitude,btohqsg
Oh wait ur the math teacher,btohqsg
math and physics are binded together,btohqsg
there’s no diff between the two,btohqsg
the weakest H2 chem student in mi would probably still be failing o lvl combined chem,btohqsg
doesn't it depend on the course and school,btohqsg
this is my first time hearing this,btohqsg
JC content is very hard to self study,btohqsg
but poly teachers are still nie trained right,btohqsg
poly don’t need to be nie trained,btohqsg
if they aren't nie trained it makes sense,btohqsg
tbh the correlation isn’t quite there anyway,btohqsg
at least uni professors actually need to become professors,btohqsg
how do you think they become profs…,btohqsg
most profs are hired based on their ability to do research and teaching is just part of their contract,btohqsg
the focus was never on teaching,btohqsg
the exceptions are certain teaching focused positions,btohqsg
but a lot of them don’t even touch teaching for years,btohqsg
and it’s diff when you get them to teach smth that’s undergrad level,btohqsg
bc it’s really way too easy for them,btohqsg
anyway in uni you shouldn’t be depending on profs at all,btohqsg
not even taking into account their quality,btohqsg
nah no discrimination shld be made,btohqsg
how do i become like you,btohqsg
what does unbalanced load in circuits mean,btohqsg
sit around all day and ask for treats,btohqsg
uneven distribution of loads in the three phase system blah blah,btohqsg
Poly lecturer + tuition teacher on the side is good pay,btohqsg
poly lecturer is gonna be my retirement job,btohqsg
I WAS SUPPOSED TO ASK A QUESTION SHE ISN'T ABLE TO ANSWER,btohqsg
my dad is an electrician so i do kinda know a bit about these kind of stuff,btohqsg
i mean you didn’t ask a hard question,btohqsg
my dad is good at math and physics while im 🤡,btohqsg
like what you asked is smth i never explicitly learned,btohqsg
kuro is gonna grad with gpa 4,btohqsg
helped roll the skin  cant fold it for shit lmao so my mom helped,btohqsg
cus my mom wrap the skin,btohqsg
Nice dumplings the plate look like a shower drain cover,btohqsg
i dont got the din tai fung kung fu,btohqsg
wonder how much they make actually,btohqsg
when students complain about sch teachers  they are complaining about nie trained teachers,btohqsg
That would be just slight below a 100% increase from my y2 sem 1,btohqsg
if i get a gpa below-,btohqsg
oh wait i don’t have a gpa,btohqsg
Man but I swear this intern will make my gpa take a roller coaster,btohqsg
First 2 days  did not even have a laptop,btohqsg
ooh I'm teaching that like right now,btohqsg
I realised that h2 phy is really on another different level then h1,btohqsg
wonder if h2 physics will change syllabus next year,btohqsg
i need to find the h1 syllabus,btohqsg
(To the 50% and 20% of the cohort U and S respectively  sry but i can’t understand how is that possible),btohqsg
I actually dun q believe if really 70% of the ppl didnt study,btohqsg
But if ppl study  how to get U and S,btohqsg
