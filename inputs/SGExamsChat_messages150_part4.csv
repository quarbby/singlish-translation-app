Okay so that means chapter 6 might not be tested,btohqsg
Oh and I got a little speech to make,btohqsg
May the odds be in your favor,btohqsg
Actually your school wants the NA kids to go to ITE or Poly so that their L1R5 have a lower chance of increasing.,btohqsg
But I learnt it from my tuition teacher.,btohqsg
I'm suprised people are surprised about these allegations. It's definitely not new,btohqsg
They will ask you to graduate and say the life out there is better.,btohqsg
wait i thgt poly is harder to get in compared to sec5,btohqsg
They don't want you at secondary five because they think NA kids can't do well.,btohqsg
Very false but teachers keep thinking this way so it's sad.,btohqsg
moral of the story go express,btohqsg
But they should be more flexible with their perceptions,btohqsg
Not every got their act together at primary 6 you know.,btohqsg
When u have someone like bodok,btohqsg
Some people just cannot understand primary school stuff  but excel at secondary school,btohqsg
true but i meant like if given a choice go express,btohqsg
IP kids are stuck with jc,btohqsg
Gets me angry very frequently actually,btohqsg
IP got a lot of opportunities,btohqsg
Me used to be neighbourhood school,btohqsg
As in its not an everyday thing,btohqsg
It depends on the school  mine didn't strongly discourage na students to go to secondary 5.,btohqsg
The environment of school is like thrash also,btohqsg
Some girl from my school said she would try to get away from IP,btohqsg
But uhm idk how to put it but we are always reminded of,btohqsg
Never even heard of it. The people I know from NA decided whether they want to go sec 5 pretty early,btohqsg
Because a lot of content you learn is nonsense and it is boring  no freedom etc,btohqsg
I hated my secondary school one.,btohqsg
I am loving my cca now in jc.,btohqsg
People actually care about each other and there is a real community.,btohqsg
Everyday friday from sec 1 to 4,btohqsg
The system is so stupid in secondary school. You cant switch if you want the 2 points.,btohqsg
I can't see the message man ._.,btohqsg
best in the west jpjc LOL.,btohqsg
I love sch i love hanging out w ppl and i love my cca,btohqsg
Cant relate whyd u say it has no freedom,btohqsg
BUT stats wise proved that the past sec 5 students didn't do very well,btohqsg
I mean surely u arent working or are in NS for u to be saying that,btohqsg
I never made a single friend from JC. I dislike the idea of CCA. A complete waste of time,btohqsg
To focus on their express student,btohqsg
My JC basically forced me to sign up for one,btohqsg
To each his own hahahaha u see cca as a waste of time i see it as a learning opportunity to interact w ppl and make friends,btohqsg
Fun journey i miss my sch days,btohqsg
But to be honest it's really by batch man,btohqsg
CCA is a waste of time if you do not have a motive for being in it,btohqsg
Never went to NS. Don't know. I'd imagine NS is terrible,btohqsg
I remember my school one of the faculty went up and told everyone she did better than most express despite the fact she was from NA.,btohqsg
Ns is only terrible if u go in thinking its terrible,btohqsg
I went into infocomm for the main purpose of picking up it skills because it looks fun,btohqsg
Its been a fun journey for me for 9 months and i havnt even left camp yet,btohqsg
