for chem eng  what are the stuff I need to pre study?,btohqsg
Think they happen arnd feb mar,btohqsg
From what I heard abt eng  they usually have a physics mod,btohqsg
But usually they have their own textbk that you can (illegally) download online,btohqsg
what course where u in again,btohqsg
i’m doing my physics phd rn,btohqsg
its one of my choices also,btohqsg
but damn hard also i dont dare,btohqsg
for any engineering just make sure your math is damn good,btohqsg
but im afraid things will get dry after the specalisation,btohqsg
anyw u shld try joining garage hehe,btohqsg
choose iem if uw more choice,btohqsg
iem can decide between design or technical,btohqsg
