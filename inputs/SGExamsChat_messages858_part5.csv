Lovely,btohqsg
just me looking through my inplace applications,btohqsg
i just wanna know the role and company,btohqsg
QIBO Quantum Intern by KEYSIGHT TECHNOLOGIES SINGAPORE (SALES) PTE. LTD.,btohqsg
About the Job:You will be working closely with the team to integrate a quantum circuit design middleware platform (QIBO) into Keysight’s Software Development Kit (SDK)  a toolkit designed to support the development  control and optimization of quantum computing systems.About the Team:You will be working in a team with software developers and quantum experts to design and implement the project. You will also clarify the requirements and enhancements with the product management.Responsibilities:Understand the tools and functionalities provided by the SDK and QIBO.Integrate the QIBO platform into the SDK  to achieve a comprehensive user-friendly streamlined workflow that encompasses everything from circuit design to its execution on hardware.Gather requirements and work with developers and physics team to refine the requests for implementation.Assist in the development of new features and enhancements for the SDK based on user feedback.Testing and validation of the framework  code review  and versioning to ensure software quality.,btohqsg
1.5k for that is a spit in the face LOL,btohqsg
thats why its funny to me LMAO,btohqsg
i made more than that as a fresh phd student,btohqsg
I'm not worried about the technical equipment  I'm more worried about getting the locations and actors,btohqsg
Uhh actors a bit hard to solve uh,btohqsg
Location uh wait you filming drama as plan uh ?,btohqsg
I've heard overseas about guerilla filmmaking but I don't know if it's workable in the SG context,btohqsg
i heard smart locals & wah bananas have internships too,btohqsg
I came to do physics not do business,btohqsg
i did both physics and bio,btohqsg
i hv to say bio is easier,btohqsg
Physics is life. It's what powers the phone you are using,btohqsg
No life for the next 2 years🙏,btohqsg
no life for a future life 💪,btohqsg
I still think jc time is the most memorable 2 yrs of my schooling life for me personally,btohqsg
Oso 70rp system seems so unpredictable,btohqsg
Tons of ppl will get straight A’s tbh,btohqsg
but they won’t study locally unless for medicine/dentistry,btohqsg
Ill look for the fmath cher tmr,btohqsg
If cannot i oso dont rlyyyy mind,btohqsg
new P syllabus is tougher than old one I think,btohqsg
Was also abit hesitent on the workload of fmath,btohqsg
Tbh is more common that JCs have FM or Computing.,btohqsg
They did list it as a subject combi,btohqsg
But i think u can still try to talk to the fmath cher,btohqsg
later they go... oops it was a mistake in the system,btohqsg
But i wld say that high chance he might say no,btohqsg
Tbh i rather do PFMl hahahaha,btohqsg
But i decided to do chem lmao,btohqsg
I didnt rly like the blind memorisation,btohqsg
I can't remember. I only know I always hit >90% for it,btohqsg
Somehow i scored higher in C than P,btohqsg
Even tho i liked P more lmao,btohqsg
not liked it because it's interesting,btohqsg
Actly wat if i just throw my E,btohqsg
P sorts of just slots into my life one day,btohqsg
H2 E is most useful years after grad,btohqsg
only if u can get A for the remaining,btohqsg
U cant rlly throw out a contrasting subject,btohqsg
I cant drop X or M,btohqsg
don't bet on your luck until promos,btohqsg
Unless u mean like ignore uh,btohqsg
P i kimda need since engineering/cs in uni,btohqsg
M very easy to score A,btohqsg
I not sure for X but I thought looks easy enough,btohqsg
