Yes  but the key point is which equity fund could possibly gives 91% return for 1 year period? Sounds like crypto fund rather than equity fund... Or is he referring to those leverage funds like TQQQ? That fund really 1yr return can hit 115%... But it's a gamble/speculation more than investment imo.,btohqsg

What do you mean use Grab to pay dining bills and payment method is linked to CC?,btohqsg
Pay with Grab wallet is pay with Grab wallet  pay Grab using CC is pay Grab using CC. 2 separate payment methods.,btohqsg
So Grab apps do have 20-30% discount on certain restaurants  when I click pay bill there  it would ask me to select my payment method,btohqsg
So is it as long as I don‚Äôt use my grab wallet pay then it consider directly charged to my cc  and therefore is eligible spending for the min spend?,btohqsg
