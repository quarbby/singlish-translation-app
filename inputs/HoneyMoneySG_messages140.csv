Happened to lots of card. Just normal thing. They can change the card reward system anytime. And sc Smart released quite sometimes already too.,btohqsg
any other cards recommended to replace sc smart card?,btohqsg
Personally I will be doing UOB Lady‚Äôs card. No minimum spend,btohqsg
No a direct replacement. Maybank fnf.,btohqsg
i think mthly i just spend ~100+ on sc smart card üòÇ,btohqsg
Question: if you pay annual fee for UOB Lady‚Äôs card Solitaire  any free miles awarded?,btohqsg
Not fair to bash the SC smart card since they have been around for 3 years maybe? It‚Äôs another window for those looking for NTB isn‚Äôt it.. there are also other cards which can replace it hence not a show stopper.,btohqsg
No miles rewarded for paying UOB lady af,btohqsg
UOB krisflyer card will be it a good choice? although the online streaming charges need to change to other cards,btohqsg
HSBC Live+ not a bad choice. If you have Spotify but don‚Äôt want to pay DCC  then use Amaze CRMC,btohqsg
i have netflix & disney+ other than that its just public transport,btohqsg
For a $120k card I‚Äôm slightly disappointed that they don‚Äôt give some miles on AF payment. Both Vantage and Prestige does and it takes away some of the sting.,btohqsg
giro no need right if alrd have salary crediting?,btohqsg
hi gurus  could i get a sanity check ‚Äî i set up GIRO w EGA. if my CRMC statement has this (in image)  does it mean it's confirmed that all is settled? and the deduction will happen close to the payment due date? thank you!,btohqsg

"Most importantly how did you deal with your ""disappointment"" you can either continue using the card or cancel the card it's simple .I give you an example of how I deal with my ""disappointment"" . I am doing the work of 2-3 people. I asked my boss for a pay raise. My boss refused. I was disappointed. How did I deal with it ? I resigned and gave 2 months notice as per contract. I haven't found a job yet btw and I quit.",btohqsg
No. We have presence in Europe. The CEO is ang mo but my direct supervisor is Asian.,btohqsg
I have just recently signed up for the  CRMC. How do I check my statement date via the app?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve only been able to see it on my estatement (top right),btohqsg
is it indicated in your transaction history on citibank app? If not contact citibank,btohqsg
Can call in to ask  usually it'll be 15.,btohqsg
May I ask if there is a way to check for MCC for a spending after it has been posted to UOB cc?,btohqsg
use heymax app. or can live chat with cso,btohqsg
Thanks. But I still don‚Äôt have any estatement yet üò¢,btohqsg

Hi all! Would like to check if anyone knows what‚Äôs the MCC for Holiday Inn lunch banquet and which mile card is the best for the down payment/payment throughout? ü§ì,btohqsg
Check in heymax if you can find the merchant,btohqsg
Maybe best to state amt first,btohqsg
I find klook esim not bad.,btohqsg
As in down payment how much  u can ask if they can spilt payment. If can contactless use uob ppv (1.1k cap) or uob vs (2k cap) to test mcc then plan accordingly the payment schedule if can spilt,btohqsg
I have a quick question. I am paying for a 4-months course ard $4.5k using Atome for 3-months installment plan. So if I use UOB Kris Flyer to pay it is still eligible to clock miles right?,btohqsg
ICC SIM cards on Shopee  been using them for all my trips,btohqsg
Technically it's possible but UOB is known for not awarding UOB ppv bonus points for atome. I'd suggest using something else instead of UOB KF.,btohqsg
You can check statement date by either call CSO or might be approved date,btohqsg
Thank u! I try for 1 month see if got manage to clock miles,btohqsg
How about using dbs wwc on atome? Will they award miles on subsequent month's payment?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think so. Check in tnc atome should be excluded,btohqsg
The tricky thing about UOB KF is that you will only get 1.8mpd after ur membership year ends. It's up to u to keep track. üòÖ,btohqsg
Should get it. But best trigger manually to be safe.,btohqsg
guess no more best no fee no min sum for simply go as scb smart become nerfed,btohqsg
UOB KF if you are into miles and can hit 800$ spend on SIA grp in a membership year.,btohqsg
ya min sum need to meet mostly,btohqsg
I use crmc with amaze with Apple Pay before I receive the physical card last few days. I think google pay work also.,btohqsg
You are left with general spend card then.,btohqsg
I am thinking of I am make wrong decision choosing UOB prvi instead of UOB KF. As I am not loyalty on either scoot or Sia flight for my trip.,btohqsg
UOB prvi is preferred to get guaranteed sign up bonus. Nothing wrong. You can get UOB KF after if there is a need to.,btohqsg
Just a question. Recently I hit my air ticket and hotel charges to UOB prvi. Do I need a UOB KF for payment of air ticket and hotel charges? And based on my this year expenses  there is less than $2000 will charge to UOB KF yearly. Can I ask for waiver of AF alsoÔºüüòÇ,btohqsg
UOB KF is my SQ  Scoot and public transport card. I like it for scoot for its additional benefits like board me first  free seat selection and/or additional checked in luggage. if you dont take scoot/sq often  i dont see a point.,btohqsg
This is also the reason why I choose UOB prvi instead,btohqsg
Btw  UOB KF is also a good card to have for large expense via Kris+. But that is case by case.,btohqsg
But based on my recently monthly spending. UOB one cc and CRMC+ Amaze can cover most of my daily expenses. Just don‚Äôt have a card for get miles on travelling.,btohqsg
Hi queenie. Now the snack is nerfed for single top up. Any other way to create spending on credit cards?,btohqsg

hey guys  just curious. for booking directly on agoda  i always selectbook now  pay later  and i always choose to pay now. the final price reflects in SGD  and my currency on the app is also SGD. but when i check the transaction in my CC statement  it's always a few dollars more. is there a reason why? does the system kinda do some calibration because of the option i selected? i.e.  price not fixedcould it be FCY charge? i remember first checking the txn in the app and it's the same as the one shown in my booking on the mobile app. but once it's settled  the price is higher in the bank app,btohqsg
maybe consider next year as this year i already book all my hotel,btohqsg
Ya i also kana this problem  also like to know about it,btohqsg
my booking on the app is 164.72. UOB settled txn is 166.37,btohqsg

Is anyone experiencing payment unsuccessfully but paying Singtel bill using amaze physical card today? I selected the credit card/ debit card via axs just now bit the payment not successful.,btohqsg
1% difference is DCC fee (dynamic currency conversion). This happened when payment gateway is overseas but the change is in sgd. Agoda payment gateway for Mastercard is in HK so DCC happens.,btohqsg
Or I can just use CRMC to make the payment? Is this still considered online payment?,btohqsg
Bill payment via axs will be excluded I think,btohqsg
CRMC on Singtel app is already considered online.,btohqsg

Anyone here had or currently have both Citi Prestige and DBS Vantage card? Which one would you pick to use personally?,btohqsg
In grand scheme of redeeming business class  pay 25 ok la...,btohqsg
I have both. I use all the specialised cards (4mpd/3-8% cash back)  maxed those first then likely for excess spend  Vantage since 1.5mpd.Prestige card is more benefits driven. It is a great card to keep in your arsenal for PayAll promotions and for 4th night free hotel bookings. Also Priority Pass 1+1 unlimited.Edit: Vantage annual fee can be waived with $60k spending annually. Prestige I have never gotten waiver before.,btohqsg
In your view  do you find both cards to have overlapping benefits? Like for example Unlimited PP (prestige) versus 10 PP (vantage); GHA Titanium (prestige) versus Accor Plus (vantage)? Also I‚Äôd assume you pay for hotels and plane tix using your Vantage card after you have maxed out your specialized cards?Thanks for your insights bro!,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
You are opening a huge can of worms for me to fill the chat now hahaVantage PP has 10 per AF period and that can be used for others as well. If you bring your family  you can use those passes for them too. Prestige is nice since you can just go with your spouse and it fits nicely. Not to mention hop around the terminals for free food at restaurants (Crystal Jade) if you want to and still be able to get into the lounge fuss free. Frankly boarding time max 2.5hrs ahead so damage is also limited :pOk on to GHA vs Accor. I find GHA to have nicer hotels and Accor membership loses in that respect. However  you do get one night free at most Accor properties and if you like buffet  the Accor membership has 50% discounts occasionally at some hotel buffets which is quite nice to bring the family for a binge at about $50 per head.For payment for air tickets  I will look at if I have enough ThankYou points to redeem the flight and put it on Prestige since it provides free travel insurance from Master Card. The point to note is that the redemption points needs to all come from Citibank.Otherwise  it is free for all and should max out specialised cards since Vantage does not give free coverage on travel insurance.,btohqsg
Thanks bro. This really helped me gained a lot of insights and firmed my decision. Thanks a lot.,btohqsg
One last question to help you decide. Do you CardUp a lot?If you do  Vantage is your best friend.,btohqsg

Oh thank you unfortunately I didn't plan well and my amaze card has hit 1000 for this month,btohqsg
Pop it into HSBC Live+ if you have the card. 8% cash back but need to spend min $600 per month for a calendar quarter.,btohqsg

Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Hmm.. I have heard of it but haven‚Äôt really used it. Gonna explore a bit.,btohqsg
I think have promotion and can use Chris‚Äô link. If you‚Äôre new to the card  just need to spend $1k to unlock 8% for the whole calendar quarter.Frankly this card is so good it is one of the fastest that get maxed for me.MCC 5311 üòä,btohqsg
If you CardUp  the AF for the Vantage can easily be waived. Just put your mortgage  tax etc into it.Free hotel stay every year plus Accor renewal.No such benefit for Prestige.,btohqsg
hiya! just checking - is the combo of instarem amaze with citirewards card still working? or should i just go for the citi cashback+ / other cashback cards instead? am a fresh grad! (lower min spent would be ideal!),btohqsg
how much is enough for annual fee waiver for dbs vantageÔºü,btohqsg
so would you recommend just going for that combo? or maybe just get a citi cashback+ for a more 'brainless' approach when spending hahaalso  am new to CCs  do these combos get modified/nerfed relativelyy quickly? or is this instarem/citirewards combo to stay?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think it overlaps.Use prestige for 4NF + lounge hoppingUse vantage for accorplus + lounge when traveling with whole family  further vantage 2nd year can get free waiver if spending is enough. I‚Äôve gotten waiver for two years so it‚Äôs like a free card.For 4NF can get enough rebate to cover the annual fee.If you feel you travel to places that you can use 4NF  prestige is worth it.If you spend enough on cardup via vantage  2nd year onwards is really free for u so why not vantage too,btohqsg
Citi rewards + amaze is as brain dead as it can get. Dont use it to book flights or hotels etc and thats all.Nerf we cant do anything.,btohqsg
I fully agree. The 2 cards combo very well together.,btohqsg
#egaOk. Hsbc said cashback for giro to ega will come in tomorrow. Let‚Äôs wait and see.,btohqsg
Oh yes just saw it. However  I noticed that the singsaver promo for travelone seems to be worse than the one from hsbc though.,btohqsg
Then use it to redeem for what?,btohqsg
Go to Citi website to redeem for vouchers? That‚Äôs if u feel that the transfer fee isn‚Äôt worth it,btohqsg
You can choose either bank or Singsaver option üòäIf you‚Äôre new to HSBC  Live+ and TravelOne can double dip since HSBC counts them separately for sign up rewards.Personally I find the TravelOne card to be quite anaemic in benefits but ok to sign up just for the rewards if you want.,btohqsg
But the whole point of the card is for miles ma haha. If redeem vouchers for stores and food confirm not worth it,btohqsg
Then can‚Äôt complain about the transfer fees lo ü§ó,btohqsg
If you really want  can also redeem cash back but take note. If you‚Äôre not redeeming from a 4mpd card (Citi Rewards)  the rate is terrible. CRMC earn rate will give you around 2.27% cash back.,btohqsg
Thanks boss! You asked what I wanted to ask. ü•≥,btohqsg
Can go to app and check. There are many vouchers.Miles are better values ofc but this is an option.,btohqsg
How long will it roughly take to get 10000 miles from this card,btohqsg

This one is more of keeping to budget issue and not problem with the card rewards hahaI do not recommend budget expansion just to max the card. If this is your earn rate  just stick to it and eventually you‚Äôll get there.,btohqsg

If me and my husband got the same card in citibank  can i transfer the points to him and he convert one shot?,btohqsg
Sorry when i meant consolidate  i mean you use cards from one bank that allows u to consolidate points into one rewards account. But all the main card holder name must be yours.E.g. DBS Altitude  DBS womans  DBS vantage all goes into one DBS rewards account. UOB PRVI  PPV  VS also goes into one. So you only need to pay one fee when transfering points from either DBS OR UOB.If it's Citibank  the points dont consolidate even if you have multiple cards  e.g. Prestige is one rewards account  CRMC is another. So if i want to transfer points from Prestige and CRMC  i need to pay 2 X fee.,btohqsg

Anyone facing issue with annual fee waiver from UOB? They rejected my fee waiver for UOB Prvi Miles Mastercard. Furthermore they deducted my UNI$ as well to reduce the fee which I never authorised them to do so.,btohqsg
Its their known behavior. Just call in go waive AF.,btohqsg
If I terminate it now  do I still need to pay for the annual fee??,btohqsg
No need to pay. But make sure you have at least 1 uni$ earning card.,btohqsg
Ok thanks  I will call them. I still have UOB ladies card. But then I not sure is my UNI$ tie with Prvi Card  cause recently I redeem it  it fail when I select Lady card. Only manage to redeem when I select Prvi Card.,btohqsg

hi gurus  i sold some positions on Syfe Trade. i understand that their rate from USD to SGD isn't the best. the only multicurrency account i have is HSBC EGA. may i ask whats the best way to withdraw the funds? to get a better spread / reduce losses due to it (it's not much tbh only 1k usd). im not too sure if the terms im using are correct too üòÖ thank you in advance!,btohqsg
I am curious also. Can we transfer USD from Syfe Trade to HSBC EGA? Would there be a fee?,btohqsg

Hi everyone I know everyone likes trust cashback card because it doesn't have fx fees for overseas transactions  but the way I see it a paltry 1.5% cashback for travel is offset by simple 4mpd cards even accounting for 3.25% fees and an additional 1% giro benefit from EGA (am assuming trust cant be added to ega). Is there a flaw in my reasoning?,btohqsg
U forgot about the juicy 15% bonus category when used overseas,btohqsg
Sorry if I‚Äôm not clear I meant:1. I won‚Äôt use trust cashback for overseas non bonus category2. The 15% bonus category when used overseas with no bank fx spread is unmatched.,btohqsg
I agree the real draw is the 15% - but this has to be a category that we frequent. Most likely not travel. Which is why I am thinking lady card etc are still good for travel,btohqsg
Dining is da best in my opinionTravel keep on Uob lady.,btohqsg
Yes up to the cap for sure,btohqsg
Yes makes sense. Thank you Mt and Anthony!,btohqsg
I'm using trust cashback a bit different from Mt. I chose category specifically I won't hit my bonus cat.My overseas spend combo is crmc + amaze and trust cashback. Many things like train tix  transport booking  etc. will get 1% cashback and 3.25% less as compared to general spend card. This is particularly helpful if I know I won't hit UOB VS 1k spend in that trip.,btohqsg
Ah I see interesting got it,btohqsg
Same I am using wellness and beauty which I know I won‚Äôt hit   then I also have youtrip with yen at 116,btohqsg

Btw guys  if you‚Äôre already on HeyMax  might as well join their new campaigns on public transport if you don‚Äôt drive.Very satisfying to see random HeyMax miles just roll in.You will need to join the campaign and link the Visa card you‚Äôre using.,btohqsg

Nothing special actually.Take my last trip in Taiwan. Hotels all prepaid w dbs alt promo. Need to use cards to pay for express train to Taipei then train tickets to Taitung. All together about 250sgd and not covered by crmc + amaze. And 200sgd on dining. All together cannot hit 1k for UOB visa signature.Hence I used trust cashback card for 3.25% less fcy fee and 1% cashback.,btohqsg
If you link your trust card to your DBS card and your DBS card to your UOB One card  technically you can stack your cash back. Spending on 1 credit card and enjoy the rewards of 3 credit cards üß†,btohqsg
Trust card cant be link to dbs. And dbs card doesn't do anything with UOB one üòÅ.,btohqsg
To be fair. They got until 2359,btohqsg
Why not use Uob ppv at 4mpd - 4% fx costs? Still higher net benefit than trust 1% - 0.8% visa?,btohqsg
TSA train tix i bought from their websites so üòÖ. Dont own dbs woman world mc due to short expiry.,btohqsg

4mpd on almost everything except travel related categories.Amaze also reduces the FX transaction fees by ~2%,btohqsg

Hi. For the first time  my credit card had unauthorised transaction. This affected my OCBC 90N. I have raised dispute and it blocked my card already. Seems like this could happen to anyone and anytime. I didn't get the notification for foreign currency apparently. For your info only.,btohqsg
you could set notification limit to lower  such as 0.1$ so you catch such trx.,btohqsg
I did. It seems that I set it for local txn. Didn't know there should be somewhere to set for foreign txn  separately,btohqsg
I'm not sure about the functions of the OCBC app. But UOB and DBS allows users to temporarily block cards. I always block my card. When I need to make payment  I will unlock the card. After payment I will block again. Very troublesome but it makes me less worried.,btohqsg
I would think so. Before can apply online for additional card as secured card holder. Recently kena rejected for application.,btohqsg
What card were you holding at that point and what card did you applied?,btohqsg
I have lot of uob cc lol. I was trying for uob krisflyer,btohqsg

only way is try appeal with uob. Next time use dbs wwmc which managed to charge 2C2 as online.,btohqsg
UOB lady (and UOB visa signature too) has 2 components  base 0.4mpd and bonus 3.6mpd.For each transaction  amount will be rounded down per 5$ block and award 0.4mpd. At month end  UOB will add everything up  round down final amount to block of 5$ and award 3.6mpd.,btohqsg
thanks Anthony!> At month end  UOB will add everything up  round down final amount to block of 5$ and award 3.6mpd.3 6mpd is for those under the category you selected right?,btohqsg
If they accumulate a few days transaction into one transaction I think is fine. Than end of month accumulate again,btohqsg
Can't rmb how they charge   last time I use priv miles for mrt etc before switching to scb smart,btohqsg
yeah i suppose! let me read the t&cs again. i might have missed this,btohqsg
Bonus point for UOB cards on simplygo.Mastercard: transaction will be posted every 5 days or every 15$ accumulated  whichever is fasterVisa: transaction will be accumulated and posted end of the month.Both will be subjected to 5$ block rounding.,btohqsg
Btw all guru  my parents going china hk Macau. Planning to pass them credit card to use. But I never been the places before. Is cc widely accepted or just download alipay etc. need recommendation if not likely old school way take cash üòÇ,btohqsg
Alipay. China cash cannot use. üòÅ,btohqsg
So just link Alipay uh everywhere?,btohqsg
Install Alipay  do the account verification so that you can use for higher amount and link credit card in the Alipay app. This is for China. Macau can also use Alipay. For HK  they have a separate Alipay HK app. I try to setup but it seems to require hong kong / china number. Alipay dont need a China number.,btohqsg
And WeChat pay. Better to get both.,btohqsg
Link a few credit cards in both apps. Sometimes  the banks may get over zealous and block the card if they start seeing frequent transaction coming in from China. I got that for my trust card. Had to use the chat in Trust app to tell them to unblock.,btohqsg
I think HK still primary use cash. Macau can use HK cash to get around if cannot use Alipay.,btohqsg
To get around Macau  I use the casino shuttle bus. Macau is small enough to walk around I feel.,btohqsg

Try to explore DBS Alt and UOB PRVI 5mpd for Fcy spend. Promo end 31 Dec.,btohqsg
If you get SUB  I would read the T&Cs if there's a claw back clause first before cancelling,btohqsg
If no claw back then cancel now  or if you think you can earn until one cashback block  then wait a bit,btohqsg
Doesnt seem to have a clawback clausehttps://www.sc.com/sg/terms-and-conditions/may-flash-sale-promotion-tc/,btohqsg

Right now  there is promo for citi payall to buy miles at ard 1.5 cents per mile.,btohqsg

Hi can i ask for the uob one credit card for the quarter  2 months i hit above 500 and 1 month above 1k  how will the cashback calculate?,btohqsg
It will be $50. They take the lowest qualifying month for the quarter,btohqsg
But whatever i spend on 1k that month  i will still receive extra 5% like those grab etc?,btohqsg
This question better to ask CS. I‚Äôm not sure if they prorate it for monthly or not even though they count the bonus cap monthly.The bonus spend will only be given at the end of the quarter.,btohqsg
Is it ideally for uob one credit card  if i hit 500 minimum   i shouldnt spend extra more on this cc?,btohqsg
I personally do $2k so better to let the others advice. This card is another good dumping ground for all those weird MCC barring the usual insurance  hospital  financial services  tax and government services.This card used to be one of the champion cards for CardUp and iPayMy but both have been excluded for about 2yrs already so cannot use it for those.,btohqsg
For example for the quarter  i spent 600   700   800. I wonder if the excess from 500 minimum spent is wasted for the cashback,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre chasing cash back  can put the excess after UOB One into Amaze CRMC. No min spend and it can give 2.27% cash back on almost everything except travel related and public transport.If you change your mind about cash back  can exchange for 4 miles per dollar.,btohqsg

Haha cancel is ok also anyway,btohqsg
The card not that great now,btohqsg

I didn't ask anyone . I use phone banking to waive it.,btohqsg

Hi all  if i open up HSBC EGA savings account now  as a new user  I will start from $0. Then after topping up a sum of incremental fresh fund (eg 100k) + fulfil the criteria of 5 eligible transactions  will i get 4.5% on the full 100k? Or interest amount be prorated?,btohqsg
Remember to send sms.From my understanding  If you transfer 100k right away when open ega  you will get1% for incremental fresh fund.3.05% for the promo interest of Nov.So 4.05% on100kMAB  which is lower than 100k,btohqsg
Monthly average balance will be lower than 100k,btohqsg
Usually bank will calc from the day you open account till month end  unless HSBC calc it differently.,btohqsg
lol then I open last day and put 100k get full interest for the month?,btohqsg
Yes  for UOB at least. I don't have recent example for ocbc or dbs.,btohqsg

Hello experts  does anyone know the difference between local set phones and overseas set phones sold on shopee phone sellers?The price difference can be quite big sometimes  so I wonder if theres actually a difference we need to take note of?,btohqsg
I saw that eligible spend excludes the following  which suggests the transactions I mentioned could be eligible for free parking:(a) Charges that are processed and billed prior to your CapitaStar Member enrolmentdate or charges that are prepaid on any Card Account prior to the first billingstatement for that Card Account following the Enrolment Date;(b) Second and subsequent transactions made with American Express instalments;(c) Cash Advances and other cash services;(d) Express Cash;(e) American Express Travelers Cheque purchases;(f) Charges for dishonoured cheques;(g) Finance charges including Line of Credit charges and Credit Card interest charges;(h) Late Payment and collection charges;(i) Tax refunds from overseas purchases;(j) Balance Transfers;(k) Annual Card fees;(l) Other credits to your Account; and(m) Physical CapitaVoucher purchases.Hence  just asking for data point from anyone who managed to qualify based on the transactions I mentioned  which are now commonly excluded from many credit cards.,btohqsg
Which phone and which market set? Some overseas set may not have full network support in Singapore  result in slower/less stable connection. Ofc many phones dont have international warranty so your phone is not covered when there are issues,btohqsg
S24 Ultra  seller mention is global set probably from HK. I'm using it day to day in SG and also on my upcoming overseas trips.,btohqsg
Beside warranty  HK set is mostly compatible with sg network. Samsung pay may have issue but you have google pay as backup. HK set doesn't have esim so if it's not a concern.For me  esim is a must so I opted not to get hk version for my phone.,btohqsg
The eSIM issue can be mitigated easily by 5ber  9eSIM  and other similar solutions.,btohqsg
If the price gap is wide enough  adding in these solutions still saves you money  plus you‚Äôve the flexibility to ‚Äúexport‚Äù the eSIM profile to other devices without asking for new QR code  since it‚Äôs the pSIM that‚Äôs tied to the eSIM profile  not your handset.,btohqsg
I wanted the esim too  apparently after I mentioned about it. Seller said the phone can support esim and samsung pay. Maybe the global one is not from HK anymore? I don't know... seem weird to me...,btohqsg
Just curious is HK set cheaper than the prices here,btohqsg
Currently using 5ber. It just works like a normal physical sim lo. Just that it can be changed in the app to select the eSIM profile you want to use.,btohqsg
This is whymobile website. A hp shop in far east,btohqsg
Actually the export and local set price on the website shown only 50$ difference. Not sure if saving $50 is worth (honestly havent used an export set before),btohqsg
Can I ask if the hsbc revolution card still earns 4mpd for purchases on shoppee/ lazada? Thanks,btohqsg
$50then not worth. Unless u mean buy from taobao or what.Price is about 20 to 25% cheaper for the flagship. [if compared to last year model locally] Bought a phone from taobao recently for my family members.,btohqsg
The one u got from taobao is what model?,btohqsg
You should look for the price in shoppee with that of the local set from whymobile.,btohqsg
My dp so far had been coded MCC 5311 if shopped online and pay through ShopBack link.

Anyone using eight sim card? Do you experience lost signals? My phone often gets no signal then connects back.,btohqsg

Your frequently visited areas may have issues with StarHub...,btohqsg
Sometimes the signal fall to 4g only  the speed is super slow,btohqsg
This is interesting. Too bad it doesnt support iphone else id have given it a try.,btohqsg
iOS restriction... But technically you can always write/swap eSIM profile on Android (5ber/9eSIM/eSIM.me/others) or Windows (for 9eSIM only with dongle) and insert the SIM into iPhone.,btohqsg

Hi expertsWill there be any FX fees if I buy air ticket online (Skyscanner Expedia ect.) while I'm at another country?,btohqsg
Fx fee mean charge in foreign currency different from your card. Dcc mean the payment is process in country different from your issue card,btohqsg
I see  as long as I select SG currency there won't be any DCC charges?,btohqsg

Anyone knows if using grab express to send parcels is wat mcc code or if it counts towards transport category for uob lady card?,btohqsg
I guess it's my fault for not realising amaze was being charged SGD instead of foreign currency... But I have previous bad experience with RCI Cruise  where I booked from their sg website and I paid in SGD... but as the payment gateway was based overseas  I was charged DCC (or something else)... So not sure how can we be sure to avoid payment fees?,btohqsg
Anyone knows what could have triggered this? All I did was update email address with UOB. My residential address and tax status had always been Singapore.,btohqsg
Looks like generic telling u. Info changed. No cause for alarm,btohqsg
There is no change required at ur end  unless there is a change with ur residency  citizenship. Any change in circumstances or new account opening with FI will require this to be reported for regulatory purposes.,btohqsg
What card are using with amaze on Expedia?Payment gateway for Expedia is in Singapore so no need to worry about DCC.,btohqsg
Hmm  I see. Very odd  since I didn‚Äôt open anything new üòÖ Nothing changed for me  guess I‚Äôll just ignore it,btohqsg
Are you sure no one is updating ur personal details? The mail seems to say email address was updated.,btohqsg
Is a system triggered process I believe. Where there is a change in ur pdpa  there is a potential change in ur residency.,btohqsg
Better check in your uob account what is the email lol,btohqsg

I'm not a miles guy  using ocbc infinity. Lol.,btohqsg

Ah it's normal. Like ad Melvyn said  bank sent mail update for this too. I got one for updating my address. üòÅ,btohqsg
Hmm  I see. First time received. I didn‚Äôt receive this when I changed residential address üòÖ but receive for change of email.,btohqsg
Strange thing is I didn‚Äôt receive when I update address 2yrs ago. Maybe this is new sop,btohqsg
This regulations are still quite new in the eyes of IRAS  thus is not yet implemented in the systems (rough guess based on my understanding). You will notice you will need to fill in fatca and crs self cert forms when u open accounts with the banks in more recent years.Anyways  if it is from an understanding perspective  is a regulation originated from US and then subsequently to other jurisdictions for the prevention of tax evasion. From a consumer perspective on how this will impact you as a client of a FI  no impact as long you still stays in SG only. Ie no impact ie also means ignore.,btohqsg

At the end of the month since CPF takes the last day closing for interest calculation.You might not want to only initiate the payment on the last day itself since I do not know the time cut off. Also take note of weekends. Do this on a working day or it might slip into next month.,btohqsg
ThxUnfortunately none of thoseI hope they deliver the card sooner then,btohqsg
Any difference between doing it in Jan vs Dec? I‚Äôve been doing it in Jan but I‚Äôve seen people doing it in Dec and not sure of the rationale,btohqsg
The tax deductible counts by calendar year. You can claim deductions for 2024 in 2025 only if the transaction happens this year. For transactions that happen in Jan 2025  you can only claim for those in 2026.These deductions are automatic so do not try to manually input it.,btohqsg

Hi guys..Asking for your opinion..Is it better to put the fund into MooMoo Fullerton cash fund?Rather than putting into OCBC360 account although OCBC360 giving saving interestAgree?,btohqsg
They are 2 different products and should not be compared like this.,btohqsg
Basically my intention is to get best return,btohqsg
One is investment and one is saving account so can't compare directly. üòÖ,btohqsg

Hi Gurus  I recently used UOB PPV for online purchase at best Denki  didn‚Äôt get any points at all,btohqsg

Cardup income tax qns: can I prepay more than the monthly amount ?,btohqsg
No. CardUp will strictly follow your submitted GIRO payment plan.,btohqsg
any idea which will be a better card after SC smart card nef? (UOB KF or DBS WWC?),btohqsg
Did you check mcc before making the purchase? It could have been a diff payment processor and used diff mcc.,btohqsg
What happens if someone does it eh,btohqsg
Check with UOB what‚Äôs the mcc of the transaction.,btohqsg
Lucky lo. If you need it to clock spending.,btohqsg
Cardup may reject your payment setup. You are required to submit your giro monthly payment plan to process ur tax payment.,btohqsg
Check under Heymax it‚Äôs 5732 which is under UOB PPV selected online transaction,btohqsg
Can i use HSBC revolution to pay for shopee payment and earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Not 100% accurate  chat with UOB and let us know. If it‚Äôs 5732  then appeal to get the 9x back.,btohqsg
I'd suggest linking ur HSBC Revo to heymax to verify mcc. Shopee has many mcc but mostly work for hsbc Revo. But in case it doesn't  can cancel transaction and repurchase.,btohqsg
Yes same I didn't receive Oct 1% giro. I used the chat  some automated bot replied with an announcement saying it will delay till 8Nov...but today alr 11 Nov liao,btohqsg
We all kenna scammed by HSBCKidding ofc. They prob had to calc 1% cashback by hand so give them some time.,btohqsg
It used to be quite fast. Within a week. Now more than a month alr and I'm scratching my head also thinking if I missed some criteria,btohqsg
any cc good to use for paying pub bills?,btohqsg
I jsut linked when i purchase it will automatically show if i can earn 4mpd? first time using it,btohqsg
Don't worry. Everyone is waiting so it's not you. üòÅ,btohqsg
Yes. It's a feature. It's called card maximizer or something like that.,btohqsg
Something like this. It works 90%-95% of the time. If u can see 10x points  it means mcc is correct and online.,btohqsg
possible to link amaze and citi to check if citi earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Only works w Visa cards.But then  amaze can test mcc by linking to empty wallet üòÜ,btohqsg
Any app like that for MC?Except amaze,btohqsg
You use amaze + empty wallet to test then use ur mc of choice to make payment.,btohqsg
I asked around  apparently alot of export phones are from HK and I think the biggest downside of the export phones are that there is no warranty...just pay abit more for local set with a peace of mind  ok la worth also,btohqsg

Thanks for response  I spend about 3-4K per month. I am planning to redeem those  points for my Europe trip. At present I have about 100k miles,btohqsg
Is signing up for UOB krisfkyer is good option ?,btohqsg
Biz class? 1 or more pax?Imo  UOB prvi is only guaranteed sign up bonus to get for UOB. Havent heard any one getting UOB first xxx for credit card in recent months.,btohqsg
2 pax Anthony :) yes I don‚Äôt have UOB card. I used to own it 4-5  years ago,btohqsg
Not fixated on biz class  I think it‚Äôs highly impossible to hit it. As I plan to travel mid next year ..,btohqsg
But you know better than me :),btohqsg
I'd suggest UOB prvi and dbs altitude for signup bonus. Can get close to 80k miles iirc. Then UOB set of cards like UOB lady solitaire  UOB visa signature  uob prefer platinum visa etc  UOB Kris flyer.,btohqsg
Read up on those then see if you have more questions,btohqsg
Is it better to enroll direct or through singsaver like sites,btohqsg
Just wondering  quick questionShould I get both UOB ladies and UOB PPV?Or should I just choose one of them?,btohqsg
Consider apply via honey money sg referral link. It helps support the channel.UOB prvi. This is via singsaver. Additional 50$ plus the usual miles. Remember to choose miles option. And send sms for annual fee option.https://t.me/HMSGHive/2086,btohqsg
Use cases different.UOB ppv: mainly mobile contactless  5$ rounding block  but mcc flexible.UOB lady: mcc restricted but one of the few can use for travel booking  contribute to uob one saving account cc spend.See ur situation,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing  definitely supporting the channel!Hmm noted that UOB PPV have 2 years of expiryUOB Lady = can book for travelI don‚Äôt spend much tbhMainly on food in CBD ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  occasionally groceries and online shopping I.e Shopee// TaobaoNot using UOB One yet thanks for C.F and SingLife ü§°Technically should consider 4mile/$ rather than miles card right? Since miles only like 1.2-1.4So should we put Citi rewards for day to day mobile / contactless? Since can pair with amaze too,btohqsg
Citi rewards+ amaze is a much more flexible card  except for cannot use to book flight/hotel/tour etc,btohqsg
If no UOB one acct  I'd say go with Citi rewards first.,btohqsg
did you get any 1% cashback from giro so far? I think I got banned. my 1% cashback no longer coming in.,btohqsg
System bug. Gotta wait a bit longer.,btohqsg
hi gurus  will klook charge in FCY or local currency?,btohqsg
oh cool! so i just need to change the currency when i book?,btohqsg
Yep. Make sure you are browsing klook Singapore website or download from Singapore app store. And choose sgd to charge.,btohqsg
oh i was thinking of possibly changing to foreign currency to jump on the dbs altitude promo,btohqsg
Can is can. But why would you want to do that when you can earn 4mpd no fee with dbs woman mastercard?,btohqsg
cause i didnt get to sign up for wwmc in time sadly haha,btohqsg
What are other cards do u have? Can get klook gift cards from heymax :),btohqsg
just these 2 actually cause my spend normally doesnt warrant more cards :s,btohqsg
What is ur 2nd card again?,btohqsg
this is a pretty genius way to double dip tho haha,btohqsg
Which are the 2? One is altitude and 2nd is?,btohqsg
sorry  altitude and crmc  but i'm pretty close to maxing out my crmc already sadly,btohqsg
Use crmc to buy klook voucher.,btohqsg
Ok lah. Dbs alt pts dont expire so not the worst thing. But are you sure cannot wait for dbs woman card? When you choose foreign currency  some sg discounts may not apply.,btohqsg
Does Citi Premiermiles Card offer complimentary travel insurance? I read on milelion that it does  but can‚Äôt find it on Citibank website. Thanks in advance!,btohqsg

Don't really recall any free one around üòÅ. Id say it's easy to create one. I rmb some said they used Google form to help with inputting,btohqsg
i dont really mind paying tbh  if it makes tracking easier and seamless (esp im doing for both myself and my fianc√©) ü•≤,btohqsg
