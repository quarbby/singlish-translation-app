Keppel DC Reit demands 48.3 million yuan late payment from China data centre tenanthttps://ift.tt/YaKeQF4December 15  2023 at 09:14AM,btohqsg
ya👍.. yesterday 🗞️ tenant might bankrupt and not Kep-DC hor🤣,btohqsg
Neo Telemedia is the sole tenant and master lessee of Keppel DC REIT’s Guangdong Data Centres 1  2  and 3. The tenant is loss-making and in a net debt position of HK$828.6 million as of 9M2023. The tenant may struggle to pay rent as all its debt will be due in a year’s time. This tenant contributes to about 11% of Keppel DC REIT’s revenue and an analyst estimated that up to 16% of the REIT’s DPU could be impacted. The management has yet to respond to this issue and the REIT is still receiving its rental payments from Neo Telemedia.,btohqsg
