Is it for better or worse in a sense,btohqsg
New physics syllabus removed stuff likesoundhow to measure temperature,btohqsg
meanwhile RI some programme going France,btohqsg
I have no clue what they removed,btohqsg
seems like they merged the chapters together,btohqsg
so instead of evolution and hereditary being 2 chapters its now 1,btohqsg
then cell division is under reprodfuction now,btohqsg
Wait its 2 chapters for yall,btohqsg
Wait wtf pure bio has 16 chapters now for 2023,btohqsg
why did I have 20 chapters in 2020,btohqsg
tbf im going by syllabus document phrasing,btohqsg
Weren't we all the COVID batch,btohqsg
We were still tested on CLT,btohqsg
But my sch IP like we learn the exact same topics just more shit in that topic,btohqsg
so movement of substances got endocytosis  exocytosis and facilitated diffusion (which tbf is nth much) then need know the random ass shit in the cell membrane like what it is a fluid mosaic model with a phospholipid bilayer smth smth got aquaporins and shit,btohqsg
Is that new or old syllabus tho,btohqsg
but it seems like subject code is the same so idk what changes,btohqsg
Damn  that's alot of terms üòÄ. Bro really just casually talks about it like it's nth,btohqsg
Ngl looks like no major changes so its not any easier or harderThe only subjects that really had massive changes recently is Pure Geog and Elect Geog iirc,btohqsg
I heard the topics r all,btohqsg
u look at syllabus document its the same,btohqsg
so its not even that different,btohqsg
I think the rly diff is for,btohqsg
cuz I legit see the tb,btohqsg
my lower sec we did molecular genetics,btohqsg
Have u seen lower sec geog,btohqsg
its completely different from what we learn,btohqsg
they have h2 geog content inside,btohqsg
they learn the smth smth men>women=whale theory,btohqsg
if u look at the diagram for it,btohqsg
GI making me wanna cry alrd,btohqsg
But the focus is more on ecosystem services,btohqsg
aka how can humans exploit the environment more,btohqsg
if someone were to read this out of context istg,btohqsg
but its sadly a geographical theory,btohqsg
for some reason my picture of it is not being sent,btohqsg
we should be on top üßçüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
geography just like all forms of academia is male dominated :/,btohqsg
which is why u have stuff like this,btohqsg
i thought a humanities subject would be more kind to females at least,btohqsg
not like engineering or cs or male-dominated fields,btohqsg
we have flying cars in 2023 but we cant get rid of misogyny even in school propaganda,btohqsg
back then it was just very male dominated and the significant people were all men. Its just that humanities are a bit more forgiving then the sciences so there are q famous like female economists/geographers/historians like Ester Boserup and Heleen Sancisi-Weerdenburg,btohqsg
I mean rn in the humanities area I would say its abit better,btohqsg
but then there's the humans vs stem inequality,btohqsg
h2 geog was the only subject I knew i could get A for,btohqsg
I had more impt things going on during a levels,btohqsg
part time work took up too much time in november,btohqsg
sec sch still okay but even in jc?,btohqsg
actually ik q a few people who work while study in JC,btohqsg
side note but my phd scholarship getting a pay raise but disproportionately to STEM vs non-STEM,btohqsg
what did u work as if udm me asking,btohqsg
social science and humans getting cucked,btohqsg
then i was a social media intern and i did film editing etc for some company,btohqsg
then i did sound engineering and shit like that,btohqsg
and now ur getting ns money right,btohqsg
so when they film videos ill be the rando with the boom mic stnading in the corner,btohqsg
is this all going towards ur uni fees,btohqsg
i have the basic 90rp scholarship,btohqsg
that u get when u go nus,btohqsg
ive never worked a day in my life smh,btohqsg
cuz i have things to do,btohqsg
if not i come home very bored,btohqsg
wait the new pure history syllabus is effectively h2 history,btohqsg
i just dont like not doing anything,btohqsg
If u knew me back in EJ...,btohqsg
my batch has the impression of me that i dont put in effort into my studies,btohqsg
but u walked out with 90rp üíÄ,btohqsg
left a gp god legacy behind too,btohqsg
aint no way the rates are that high,btohqsg
Bro had his main character arc,btohqsg
being known for being good in GP is nth :(,btohqsg
its both a gd and a bad thing,btohqsg
its not even good or bad,btohqsg
u just good at a subject,btohqsg
no one gonna care abt it in the future,btohqsg
fr no one cares in the future,btohqsg
theres a lot of worse things you could be known for yk,btohqsg
no one cares abt what u get for PSLE,btohqsg
or what u get for o levels,btohqsg
fine ask me in five years if this gc still exists,btohqsg
cuz ur alr past that stage in life,btohqsg
As long as education is still compulsory in sg  this chat will still exist,btohqsg
this one is dependent on ur stage in life mah,btohqsg
like at our age people do care ab what u got for As,btohqsg
and what uni course ur doing,btohqsg
in 5-10 years they‚Äôll be asking what ur job is and A levels wont matter,btohqsg
after As  no one cares abt ur RP. Let alone being known as the guy who can memorise an AQ that they wrote in an exam,btohqsg
not even 5-10 years like within your first sem of uni,btohqsg
A levels is only impt up till the point where u get into uni,btohqsg
like when you first get your results and deciding where to apply then yea people care and it feels nice,btohqsg
Uk i have a bad rep in EJ rite,btohqsg
nice if u do well  pressurising and painful if u didnt,btohqsg
tbf its mainly the chs kids,btohqsg
but i would bet that ur ‚Äúbad/controversial rep‚Äù is incredibly subjective,btohqsg
yea but once you're within your own uni course,btohqsg
idk if its bc of the ip kids,btohqsg
some people judge but for the most part,btohqsg
you just do your own thing,btohqsg
everyone has had a bad rep at some point,btohqsg
i had a bad rep in DHS,btohqsg
i was also very controversial in my batch1. They didnt like the fact that I didnt have to study as much but still did better than most of them2. They didnt like the fact that I spent so much time hanging out with different friend groups3. Especially in J2  they didnt like the fact that I was close to alot of J1s,btohqsg
then this year i went back flip off an asshole teacher i had,btohqsg
definition of they hate you bc they ain't you,btohqsg
I thought those ppl will always exist one,btohqsg
and that og gang also they didnt like me,btohqsg
They got skill issue  not enough xp to level up as much as you did,btohqsg
how can ur oglings not like u as an ogl,btohqsg
ive never heard of that ever happening,btohqsg
cuz i tried to get them to talk to the jae kids,btohqsg
anywyas ur orientation had alot of drama,btohqsg
First time hear orientation alr got cliques liao,btohqsg
cuz JIP orientation is one month before jae orientation,btohqsg
they only removed it this yera,btohqsg
got jip kids dating before the jae even come into ej,btohqsg
next year onwards no more jip ori,btohqsg
the one specific couple im talking ab still tgt,btohqsg
My sch dating culture is weird af  date for fun only sia,btohqsg
thats not unique to ur sch  thats just our gen üíÄ,btohqsg
OGLs running arnd  JIP kids spreading shit,btohqsg
i only know one guy from a5,btohqsg
who i have drama with personally,btohqsg
okay then its a diff guy,btohqsg
is it a chs guy too tho,btohqsg
the one i have beef with is chs,btohqsg
that class pcme class with a whole group of rowdy chs boys,btohqsg
i feel bad for mrs lee sia,btohqsg
i got beef personally w one girl from that class,btohqsg
uk everytime i talk to her shes like...,btohqsg
i feel bad for any chers that have to deal with these kinds of classes,btohqsg
okay la actually my 3 classes were okay,btohqsg
but imo ur batch had a lot more drama than mine,btohqsg
One was rowdy chs guys + nice peopleOne was just confusing to deal withOne was an arts class that didnt feel like an arts class,btohqsg
or maybe it seems that way bc my batch lacked drama so much that they picked off on our seniors (aka ur batch) so we hear ab ur batch‚Äôs drama the most,btohqsg
what drama is there even in my batch,btohqsg
ngl my class was just isolated from the rest of ej we just did our own shit,btohqsg
how does an arts class not feel like an arts class,btohqsg
uhm niles‚Äô scandal is one famous one,btohqsg
okay but thats cuz hes just a problematic person,btohqsg
eh but he almost won prom king so wtv,btohqsg
tbf its cuz the prom king got memed into winning it  then the prom queen who won the person who went up against her spent her entire set shitting on chs men,btohqsg
so she lost all the chs men vote,btohqsg
but she went up against problematic sn girl,btohqsg
i have no clue but i think sn,btohqsg
well good thing that other girl didnt get it then,btohqsg
ej drama is stupid la ngl,btohqsg
yk i thought people would at least be mature in jc,btohqsg
im very well known in my cohort,btohqsg
then also cause i taught there temporarily,btohqsg
and cuz all ej chers are like young af we also just talk abt ej drama,btohqsg
the chers will talk abt the students,btohqsg
like so and so is xxx,btohqsg
maybe ur just damn lowkey and lucky enough to have stayed that way,btohqsg
in ej the chers are q close to the students,btohqsg
lol my class had no drama,btohqsg
bro class drama is so overrated,btohqsg
I feel like genuinely speaking the more bonded a class is the better the performance in A Levels,btohqsg
i am very close to hating that cunt,btohqsg
The thing abt ur batch is they used me to go places and when they were done they just stopped,btohqsg
he got in through his connections w u,btohqsg
or dumped work on u or what,btohqsg
He passed his probation cuz of me,btohqsg
honestly my class too many chs council boys,btohqsg
And he got into trip sci cuz of me (I pulled too many strngs),btohqsg
i didnt even believe he was from chs council till my other chs friend said so,btohqsg
since when do students have influence over subject combis,btohqsg
he got into a programme that allowed him to get trip sci,btohqsg
i pulled him into the programme,btohqsg
only for him to take h1 math now and flunk his other subjects pfft,btohqsg
yk my class made an instagram acc just for him,btohqsg
cause he always sleeps in class,btohqsg
every single day every single lesson,btohqsg
okay but anyways in general ej ulti kids are,btohqsg
can i ask a dumb question,btohqsg
he dropped and convinced half my class to drop too,btohqsg
how many of yall above 18 rdy,btohqsg
more than half the people here at least,btohqsg
(initially 25 but 6 people left sch/retain),btohqsg
normally thats what yall would drop to h1,btohqsg
but the h2 geog students are q strong generally in geog,btohqsg
then out of 19 we have 9 taking h1 math,btohqsg
he takes the exact same combi as me,btohqsg
ok la in his case i can see why he wouldnt wanna drop h2 lit,btohqsg
its too easy and so little content and hes a slacker,btohqsg
(easy provided u have the skills already and he pretty much does),btohqsg
instead of dropping h2 geog or h2 hist,btohqsg
is his lit gdin chs it was like meh,btohqsg
in arnd 150 days'll be 18,btohqsg
he writes notable essays every now and then,btohqsg
but h2 lit is 6 essays and hes not getting an A if he only writes 1 or 2 good essays,btohqsg
i judge someones intellectual capability by their ability to do gp,btohqsg
gp i cant say about anyone in my cohort,btohqsg
but whether they will get A in A levels...,btohqsg
I think my 3 classes each class i shud be able to get minimally 5As,btohqsg
minimally 5 is pretty good imo,btohqsg
especially with u as their cher,btohqsg
ngl now i wanna know if other feeder jcs are just as petty as eunoian jip kids,btohqsg
in that 3 months i pulled one class msg from 3.2 to 2.2,btohqsg
why never teach my class üò≠,btohqsg
i think hes a v nice person and cher,btohqsg
like i go consult then aft consult oso i still dk what to do to improve,btohqsg
but it also depends on whether my style of teaching matches the class cuz im more skills focused,btohqsg
my gp struggled at a stagnant B for my entire j2,btohqsg
is it good or bad to have ip students in your class,btohqsg
How bad could they be tho,btohqsg
I met one from jc  fella ooc from bmt and got posted to some combat unit to be asa  got tricked by superior that recourse bmt and go back unit. End up recourse bmt got posted become man  during trade course fella just keep whining how his life sucks when he could be studying and doing online coding course,btohqsg
But their house outside got nice patch of garden,btohqsg
the American friends I have just talk about how much better Singapore is,btohqsg
then my best friend gonna jump from US to ireland using her relative's nationality when she can,btohqsg
Good thing abt singaporean is no capital gain on profits,btohqsg
Us citizens have to do taxes for yolo profits,btohqsg
U paid for the $120 rdy,btohqsg
Even if tmw u win 4d or toto also no tax I believed,btohqsg
The only thing gov gonna tax is from your personal income tax,btohqsg
Provided u no house n car all that,btohqsg
not just that  they have herd mentality oso which just segregated jae kids and theyre also egoistic for no reason and drama-thirsty,btohqsg
my experience with IP kids is just that in general most of them are privilegeed,btohqsg
i talked abt it last time where i used to get bullied by people cuz i didnt have money to go out with them to eat and i needed to go do a part time job elsewhere :/,btohqsg
ip kids being entitled is just normal atp,btohqsg
same except i didnt go do a part time job cause its just my parents that refused to give me an allowance at all,btohqsg
my friend also i think a close relative of his passed away and he was the sole breadwinner of the family  then he couldnt go out with others for a period of time cuz money issues. Then this damn rich guy from punggol straight up made fun of him and his close relative dying,btohqsg
and the thing is chs IP is still like not the worse in terms of entitled behaviour IMO,btohqsg
they just dk how to act like human beings,btohqsg
true entitled I FEEL is sngs,btohqsg
of the ip schs i talk to,btohqsg
then most scgs girls is just rich,btohqsg
thrs also been rumours about how one of them nepotismed into nus medicine (her father is on the med board and apparantly she got in after she failed the first trial but her father angery or smth then pulled her in),btohqsg
then she went around flexing like she damn smart or smth during a levels results release and the fact that she got into nus med after she got in :/,btohqsg
did uk some of them dk malays need to eat halal food hntil uni,btohqsg
didnt know the rumours got so far,btohqsg
idk what makes jip kids so much more immature than jae kids,btohqsg
like where does that difference lie,btohqsg
i feel like the whole rich stereotype is only really valid for like raffles and hwa chong ngl  but the entitlement and elitism is so fucking bad,btohqsg
im from the same batch as her,btohqsg
she was one of the people that spread a shit load of rumours abt me,btohqsg
she got nth better to do issok,btohqsg
her father was also a doctor who handled my medical case,btohqsg
ask a hwach ip kid if he has malay friends,btohqsg
or indian friends for that matter,btohqsg
ik of guys who been thru ns and have 0 non-chi friends,btohqsg
"Basically i got ooc from tekong cuz of some heart condition. I went to NUH first and the doctor I met refused to do any proper testing or anything (only took blood pressure  no ECG) then he told me ""I wont do any other tests cuz its a waste of resources"".2 months later I went national heart center. I did a cardiac MRI they told me I have a severe heart issue :/",btohqsg
wah rarely pop in sgexams once i come in got tea liao,btohqsg
the NUH doctor was her father,btohqsg
that nepoed her into nus med,btohqsg
my heart condition is till the point whereby if it was caught too late its considered fatal,btohqsg
i went to hcjc early this march for nsg right  not a single non-chinese person in sightand i went to the bookshop to buy the hcjc shirt  the aunty was so fucking racist to me. i was just flipping through the lit texts that they do cause i was curious and she was like ‚Äúdont touch  u cannot buy‚Äù and then when i went to pick shirt size  she let my friend take it out of the plastic and check against her body to see if it fits but when i tried to do the same she just swatted my hand and said not to touch it,btohqsg
i almost went to revoke my oot status using his memo. If it triggered my heart condition  its actually gg gone case alr,btohqsg
i also got scammed by the cafe aunty who sold me gummies for double the price and i didnt know till i was telling my friend who bought the same gummies how ex they were,btohqsg
i was considering not going for my national heart center appointment also cuz NUH is like also same same mah,btohqsg
i have more non-chi frens than chi frens,btohqsg
anyways from what ik abt her i wont be surprised if its true,btohqsg
the best student of our cohort,btohqsg
cant u sue him for that,btohqsg
and she came back to make some speech,btohqsg
ngl ej going to shit ever since our new principal took over,btohqsg
the people they chose for the pinnacle awards,btohqsg
one of them was chosen cause she signed on,btohqsg
also yes i can but whats the point,btohqsg
No but fr this girl that im talking abt apparantly since pri sch alot of shit just got handed to her :/,btohqsg
thats why alot of the girls from her sec sch and pri sch i talk to dont rly like her,btohqsg
cant believe shes gonna be a future doctor,btohqsg
"uk she went around to alot of my batchmates and said stuff like""Oh you got A for gp in a levels ah but I thought normally your essay writing is damn bad one sia how you pull it out?""",btohqsg
then she pissed off alot of people,btohqsg
bro she sent my batch like a little clip for our grad day ab how u can be whatever u want to be and the signature at the bottom said NUS medicine then everyone was like WAHHHHH,btohqsg
but wtv ej still treats her as a signing star,btohqsg
to the point where they were willing to slander another of their own students for it,btohqsg
she was vice head prefect in sec sch too,btohqsg
i feel like when ur in as high places as someone like her  nobody really cares what u say unless its directed at u,btohqsg
didnt know he was like that,btohqsg
do uk abt the homophobic thing,btohqsg
nah actually nvm i knew he was,btohqsg
yeah thats what i just thought of,btohqsg
thats why my gp cher left the sch,btohqsg
and he had one of the highest distinction rate in GP,btohqsg
also btw dont u have bio tmr why r u awake now,btohqsg
just goes to show society is shit,btohqsg
and its ok i slept 14h yesterday im not tired anyway,btohqsg
id rather read through content and ans keys till i have to go write a 100 mark paper in 2h,btohqsg
even worse than chem p2 smh,btohqsg
why is sg so distinctly tiered honestly? like yes legacy serves a purpose but why maintain the hierarchy left behind? u have people acting entitled  nepotism giving undeserving people top-tier opportunities  and truly deserving people being discriminated against for unrelated things,btohqsg
We talking abt IP kids being entitled,btohqsg
but in general most ip kids have like,btohqsg
Yo I heard stories where some of those students literally have a butler with them LOL,btohqsg
I thought hiring a maid is alr quite ex but a butler? Sheeshhh,btohqsg
a butler?? yo are these people royalty or smth wtf,btohqsg
nawwww was boutta go to sleep but suddenly some cockroach appeared next to me on my BED then i tried killing it with my geog tb. the mf still didn't die üò≠,btohqsg
i don't even think i can sleep no more,btohqsg
just get up and clean yo bed,btohqsg
There are quite a number who would look down on other races because of the lack of interaction,btohqsg
This has led to some malays dropping the muslim identity just to fit in,btohqsg
how yall do grp proj with ppl u don't like,btohqsg
esp if they ur ex friends,btohqsg
Force urself to stay professional and only talk abt work,btohqsg
If they wanna be cheebai and don't do the work,btohqsg
Imo nuh is the most fucked up hospital lol their psychs are pretty bad too,btohqsg
is nt cuz of this lol,btohqsg
is cuz they always leave me out,btohqsg
and then i there also like nt there,btohqsg

bullying is a huge problem now days,btohqsg

i send her 100 she sends me 1,btohqsg
Anw any form of bullying is just as bad,btohqsg
The ppl who Cyber bully really stoop that  low  lol,btohqsg
the only time i rmbr when bullying got stopped for me was in p3 when some boys shot staple bullets at me. i tell cher then my cher scold them. but then also the name calling nvr stop,btohqsg
Ik got some Cher close one eye even when they saw bullying happening Infront of them lol   like cos they ahem dl the student themselves,btohqsg
But then the Chers in that sch quite bias and fked up from what I've heard,btohqsg
we didn‚Äôt planned to hit her in the vc first place. when we found out she was gg to the chalet  we wanted to find her to talk things out cause she kept spreading shit and rumours abt us. she called us sluts  homie hoppers  spread fake shit abt all of us  put the blame on us for smth tht happened vv long ago. so when we talked things out she got damm agitated and started shouting at us then we shout bk ah then she tired the push us to leave then my frnd nt happy so she went to slap the girl then everyone started chanting whack whack whack. then everyone rly whack ah. but we all know it‚Äôs wrong so we willingly accept all the hate and the punishment we get,btohqsg

Its about doing smth work related afterall and I'm sure all of you would wanna ace it,btohqsg
Just treat them like how u would treat any group mate  as if nth happened LOL  put aside wtv that's happened and shift of focus lor . Otherwise  it'll be hard to even do smth simple related to the grp project,btohqsg
After the grp proj then u can throw a tantrum abt how life's unfair and flick off life itself,btohqsg
If it's damn hard then maybe u guys can talk it out if possible,btohqsg
To be on the same page uk,btohqsg
Eh cnnt ltr student evaluation gg,btohqsg
Find a way to include urself in lor or fill in any part amiss,btohqsg
