is the new jap stall ehe,btohqsg
suppose you do math as 2nd major/minor in uni along side a pri major (in this case  assume lifesci) would u be eligible to teach math in moe schs,btohqsg
youâ€™d still need to do a PGDE under NIE,btohqsg
but if you have the pgde can right,btohqsg
yes like my friend in physics who got the MOE scholarship while in undergrad was asked to do a math minor to be able to teach sec sch math,btohqsg
sec sch usually they can teach two subjects,btohqsg
arrange the soccer balls in the same of a graph,btohqsg
"but isnt bio the ""furthest"" from math in terms of the natural sciences",btohqsg

Actl should I js screw everything and go NUS CS,btohqsg

like no matter where you come from or how old you are you need to go through NIE in some form first,btohqsg
but poly lect no need right,btohqsg
MOTHER LOVE ME LONG TIME LONG TIMESUCKY SUCKY FUCKY FUCKY WONTON HONG KONG  HONG KONG,btohqsg
cause the polys arent directly under moe no,btohqsg
math+physics the most common. almost all the math tchers tht i had in sec sch oso taught physics,btohqsg
cause physics is just applied maths,btohqsg
no need but thatâ€™s a diff thing,btohqsg
and chem is just applied physics,btohqsg
and bio is just applied chem,btohqsg
they either have quite a bit of industrial experience,btohqsg
or some have masters or phd,btohqsg
ite oso. my lects all came frm the industry,btohqsg
which makes sense since itâ€™s more work related stuff in theory,btohqsg
actl isnt math js applied philo,btohqsg
oh js curious   whats ur course,btohqsg
btw i did titration today and my values were super close to teacher values,btohqsg
i think my sec sch js lack of tchers,btohqsg

then last remedial got a girl say she got tuition can go early,btohqsg
The article inside said BKT isnâ€™t inside Malaysiaâ€™s top 30 dishes list though. Shouldâ€™ve chosen some other dish instead,btohqsg
in some uni math is under bachelor of arts,btohqsg
usually bachelor of arts in math the math is like pure math oriented,btohqsg
while bachelor of sci tends to be more applied math in a sense maybe,btohqsg
but then for nus iirc theres only bachelor of sci for major in math,btohqsg
True one possible way would be to ask each race what dish is their favourite  then among the 10 dishes nominated give each race the number of dishes proportionately,btohqsg
Like if 20% of the population is Chinese nominate their top 2,btohqsg
