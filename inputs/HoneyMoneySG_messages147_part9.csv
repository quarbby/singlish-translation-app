Very disappointed with OCBC bank. Not recommended at all.OCBC is the worst bank I‚Äôve dealt with. They claim accounts are opened instantly on their website with SingPass  but my experience says otherwise. I opened a 360 account  and it took them over two weeks to approve it.I also applied for a CDA account for my child  and it‚Äôs been more than two weeks with no response.Today  I decided to cancel my savings account and will switch my child‚Äôs CDA account to another bank. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend OCBC. They take forever to get things done.,btohqsg
Yea but in my exp. Its the best account that suits most sgporeans spending habit esp corporate employees,btohqsg
"ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠ my first occurrence with them when I was very young and they rejected my application because ""not of age"". Then on same day  opened POSB account instead. Never thought of being their customer till today.",btohqsg

Hi guys I've been linking my premium miles credit card to my amaze(instarem) account. Recently I realize it's been charging me 1% amaze fees for all my transactions. What's going on ah? My miles on citibank also like not reflected. I've spent more than a few thousands and yet it's only a few hundreds on citibank?,btohqsg
incur 1% amaze fee if exceed 1k for local spend or on mcc6540/4111. What u spending on  is it in exclusion list on citi premiermiles card? Why need to link Amaze to citi premiermiles card in the first place?,btohqsg
Cause people were saying that if you spend on things like flight ticket then it will be excluded on premium miles card rigjt?,btohqsg
And things like car road tax and insurance. Will be excluded on premium miles so should use amaze to pay. If not then what's the point of amaze?,btohqsg
u talking about citi rewards card or citi premiermiles card?,btohqsg
Amaze does not change the mcc  if insurance and govt services mcc are excluded then still excluded even if pair with Amaze.Main use case for Amaze is to pair with citi rewards card to convert to online spend to get 4mpd so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
Any suggestions on where better to move funds?,btohqsg
