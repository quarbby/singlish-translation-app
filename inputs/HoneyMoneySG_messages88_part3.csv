Tonight is the deadline for cpf oa application,btohqsg
Ooh. Sorry  not aware the cpf is earlier than cash,btohqsg
Yup and is guaranteed principal.. 3.5% is not too bad I guess?,btohqsg
They will calculate your average balance over the month. Note that the interest is only credited at the end of the month so it doesn't help increase your average balance,btohqsg
Yup. No need to be scared after 6 months will drop below 3.5% p.a. or what,btohqsg
May I know if UOB VS pay online subscription how to ensure payment gateway not from Singapore to earn oversea spend x10Example: YouTube in RM  Agoda in RM etc,btohqsg
May I know if Ex date on 5 February. If I buy today will I entitle to earn dividends,btohqsg
May I know what if I buy on 5 February?,btohqsg
So the last day would be 4 February? For CDP account,btohqsg
Are you saying that for that month just withdraw all out and put in another higher interest rate account since without the save bonus component  it will only be 2.5% from the salary component for OCBC 360?,btohqsg
Yes.It will be range from 2.6%-3.1% depends on the amount you have for both spend n salary category.If you only have salary category  it is between 2%-2.5%.,btohqsg
Then I will do that on 1 Feb,btohqsg
hello  masters. This is the full tnc of uob one card  i'm wondering what the highlight part mean? I really appreciate an example of it,btohqsg
Abit of a stupid question  for UOB EVoL credit card  the 8% cashback for mobile contactless spend applies for Apple Watch pay as well right,btohqsg
Which bank gives better interest rate ?,btohqsg
Must make sure it is contactless  if watch touches the machine then not counted,btohqsg
Can I confirm whether I should use my Amaze card or my UOB card to book my flight?,btohqsg
It's my first time using Amaze  so I'm not entirely sure about the process.I assume I should use my Amaze card for payment since my UOB Ladies card is linked to it  right?,btohqsg
The answer is already in the message you sent,btohqsg
If its foreign currency  makes sense to use Amaze linked to UOB Lady‚Äôs. If it‚Äôs local currency  I don‚Äôt see the point to use Amaze  I‚Äôll just use UOB Lady‚Äôs directly.,btohqsg
Ah  I understand now. So  Amaze is specifically for overseas purchases  thanks Jasmine for sharing,btohqsg
isn‚Äôt the watch considered as mobile contactless also?,btohqsg
I‚Äôll make sure to add an extra screen protector so it doesn‚Äôt touchüëçüèª,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt they say by 31st jan,btohqsg
Uhh so long it‚Äôs mobile contactless (iPhone or Apple Watch) and you bring it to the machine it is ‚Äòcontactless‚Äô. You can touch the machine and it will be counted,btohqsg
Any idea if i will enjoy my full tax relief if i top up to my mum if she‚Äôs reaching 55 this year?OA+SA = already exceed the year‚Äôs FRS (205.8k)But SA alone definitely not enough to hit 205.8k. If i top up to SA does it qualify for 8k tax relief for YA2025?,btohqsg
UOB PRVI miles don‚Äôt have a monthly cap on the reward miles?,btohqsg
Hello I have a question (dilemma of sorts). I know several finfluencers including heartland boy advocate for trying to reach BHS first in order to supercharge SA  if not hit FRS yet.If my mandatory employee and employer contributions via OW and AW would have already hit the CPF annual contribution limit of $37 740  Does it still make to sense for me to VCMA In order to try to hit BHS? (and get some tax relief too)Or should I just RSTU to my SA and work towards FRS directly? (and get some tax relief too),btohqsg
Best if can install antenna also,btohqsg
FRS limit only based on SA. Can top-up 8k and get tax relief before RA is formed. Reminder this monies will be reserved and will go directly to RA for CPF Life.,btohqsg

Got more requirements. You have to spend at least $500 a month with UOB cards and credit salary into your UOB account,btohqsg
Yes.. instead of salary credit  can configure to send money to 3 family members 10 dollars. Any restrictions on 3 Giro? Like min amount and must be vendor ?,btohqsg
3 Giro must be made to businesses  and the  business has to initiate the giro payment,btohqsg
