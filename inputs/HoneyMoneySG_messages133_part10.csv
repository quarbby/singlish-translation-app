Updated  the Live session will be held in heymax telegram chat grouphttp://t.me/+gNZRwXXy9Gc1MzJl,btohqsg
just to highlight be careful about Online Shopping and Sports Goods Shop.some shops you think is shopping might end up with Sporting Goods mccbest to test (with amaze if you can).Grey zones I encountered rather frequently in Australia: Fila  Adidas  Nike etc... They can either be shopping or sports category.,btohqsg
yeah ONLINE no issue  but if your shopping shop is MCC 5655 or 5941 (VERY COMMON!) for example you GG if you chose online shopping,btohqsg
