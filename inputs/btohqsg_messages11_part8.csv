If u sell before MOP. relax ah sis. Hahahahah.,btohqsg
Tat time only shg n ehg,btohqsg
Mine my grant only one b4 they combined the grants,btohqsg
Actually is just table wat to pay for,btohqsg
If ur grant is more than 10% of ur total flat price u should be quite ok,btohqsg
I think the HDB scheme quite affordable for common people   exclude those trying to make a quick buck.Else it's affordable I guess,btohqsg
The 2k option fees can use to pay for downpayment also.They will ask u u wan a refund or keep to use it,btohqsg
Oh is it?! Now u cannot take back the option fee?!,btohqsg
they never asked me back in 2017 though,btohqsg
I got my option fee back,btohqsg
I rmb the officer ask wat account to put in,btohqsg
Yup den 2 wks in already,btohqsg
Still go to flat  so still ok,btohqsg
Can try request. I requested n got 2k refunded,btohqsg
hello! any idea when will the amount of grant we can get  be assessed?,btohqsg
hmm roughly second appt to know?,btohqsg
or when we get the HLE letter?,btohqsg
Yst i called  the lady said 3-6weeks,btohqsg
Second appt signing of lease you should already know ba,btohqsg
When u go for ur first appt officer will tell u the amount of grant u will likely be getting it will take 6 to 9 mths for grant to be approve.u will only know the final grant u will be getting 2 wks b4 signing of lease.,btohqsg
what if someday  the accrued interest of the grant is more,btohqsg
that'd be 29th year onwards for any amount of grant,btohqsg
I have a question...I asked about including my youngest child as occupier of my new flat quite some time ago here. I tried to do it today  they prompted that a new set of conveyancing and stamp fees will be charged if agreement of lease was already signed. Anyone did this before??,btohqsg
Yup u need hire a lawyer to do so,btohqsg
So if let's say  after moving into my bto and I get pregnant  I have to hire lawyer again to include my newborn?,btohqsg
Yup if u wan add or remove occupier have to do b4 u sign,btohqsg
?!?!?! That is new to me. I was pregnant when I signed  nameless and no identity how do I even include,btohqsg
To be completely honest  I am pissed,btohqsg
Like that I don't dare to give birth,btohqsg
thought just add occupier will do,btohqsg
still have to involve lawyer ah,btohqsg
Precisely!! Somemore mine is sbf fml,btohqsg
My own kid leh   not my employee,btohqsg
The hdb officer say u wan add or remove occupier need to do b4 signing of lease if not u have to hire lawyer to do so,btohqsg
what about if have new family members in the future,btohqsg
I assume lawyers involved probably meant family members who are not immediate family,btohqsg
They told to send in the request through feedback form,btohqsg
Then the officer will get back to me,btohqsg
I also asked what if I got pregnant again after I moved in? She said she also not sure so better send in feedback,btohqsg
I went to reread my lease of agreement,btohqsg
Cos one of my friend she bto with her bf but she put as occupier,btohqsg
There's only signing of no withdrawal  nothing says inclusion,btohqsg
Then she went to sign lease head of the department keep advising ask her wan be co applicant say now change no need pay anything n is free but after sign u wan change or remove need hire lawyer to do so,btohqsg
your friend got thoughts of upgrading to condo ah,btohqsg
I applied under Parenthood priority scheme also wor,btohqsg
Cos tat time she still student,btohqsg
A bit contradicting to apply for pps coz i pregnant then after that still need to find lawyer to include a new child zzzzzz,btohqsg
sorry that I don't have any contributions@BlaiseMiyako,btohqsg
Nono it's not your fault hahahaha,btohqsg
Based on wat I know change or remove occupier after signing need lawyer.pps other case maybe,btohqsg
