Only thing is that it‚Äôs closed,btohqsg
Theg juz showed the sch this,btohqsg
Maybe even yi performance is better than this?,btohqsg
I would think yi median is at least 67.5  and given the MI slide which says ‚Äúalmost half the students scored UAS of 67.5 or above‚Äù MI median should be just below 67.5,btohqsg
I was absent when pw groups was released then i heard fr my friend that there is this girl who was initially in my grp but insisted to trf coz she has got sth against me (actually me too she is so LOUD even she kena on mj confession someone say she laugh like a horse). Then ended up my grp kena this girl who dun even turn up for sch apparently hv an illness then withdrew after promos and apparently came back a yr later lmao,btohqsg
My bro said he receiving pw groups sometime this week,btohqsg
My whole group is so quietüò¢My clique split like 2-2-1 and i was the 1 who ended up in another grp:-(,btohqsg

did you guys hear of the thing where you can write 1 person udw to work with on a paper and give to teacher,btohqsg
cause my friend said their jc have this but idk if all jc have or is just that particular jc,btohqsg
I think it varies between JCs but in general ppl should be able to complain,btohqsg

The Pw teacher will try mediate between the students but if cannot then will escalate further,btohqsg
Can go all the way up to the principal if very serious,btohqsg

Seems that it happens a bit more frequently than in yi  because yall had at least 2 since 2019 whereas yi only had 1,btohqsg
