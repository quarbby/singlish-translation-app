it has been a very fufilling conversation with you today  glad that we all came to an agreement,btohqsg
Ya. the rich get to hog resources,btohqsg
Being average is the new normal,btohqsg
Because we boost up our lower sections by giving them grants and subsidies and the higher end makes money off their increased spending,btohqsg
I would say  use resources they have earned,btohqsg
Because not all rich have earned them,btohqsg
Wa la wa la wa la,btohqsg
The additional incremental component on coe prices for those having to own more than one car,btohqsg
no la but there is honestly not much that can be done,btohqsg
but this will just cos the rich ppl to hog more,btohqsg
Lets face it  this conversation is no longer about cars,btohqsg
COE 100k nia  their cars 700-800k,btohqsg
I agree  thank you Mr PCC for being open minded and willing to listen to the logic,btohqsg
1 month add 1k to the installment lor,btohqsg
they dont care one la HAHA,btohqsg
Did someone mention on removing cat b?,btohqsg
Car should just be a flat tier.,btohqsg
I would say it's always been the same  just that we see the struggles and the lavishness more by way of increasing content and social media access,btohqsg
We are all just depresso  I need an espresso,btohqsg
Cat B is for the regular cars sirâ€¦,btohqsg
u put all in 1 cat  all the coe gonna go up like siao bro,btohqsg
There is not much difference when the industry is manipulating the quota,btohqsg
And introducing separate COE for phv,btohqsg
A Cat B+ or something could be introduced for engines over 3000cc or 4000cc,btohqsg
Why the need to make cat b coe more affordable for the rich?,btohqsg
This might help stabilise the prices for Cat B buyers more,btohqsg
One tier  and if own more than one car  then he pay extra 50% on that coe,btohqsg
But not too much of a difference,btohqsg
If this is the 3rd car  coe will be 200%. Huat ah.,btohqsg
Just like property  they can put the car under other people names,btohqsg
Just that now as a 2.0 golf buyer  your bid is not up against a 6.75 cullinan buyer lol,btohqsg
200% is 200k coe. Only 10% more on top of a car that cost 2mil,btohqsg
Cat b isn't more affordable for the rich though?,btohqsg
In fact  cat Bs whole existence is to make cars over 1600cc more expensive,btohqsg
And only 4% on top of a bugatti  and it cant even be driven here,btohqsg
Well same for property lor. Until gov step in to close the loophole that rich uses,btohqsg
Better examples for the same price range that can be driver here,btohqsg
Why do you think lawyers and personal accountants make money,btohqsg
Lol. So they can get more cars?,btohqsg
Fyi  a alfa giulia gtam which cost 1mil to be on the road  1 of the buyer bought without registering. So he only paid 200+k. Coe 1 mil also doesnt natter to him,btohqsg
Because they find loopholes  ways to reduce tax payments  using SPVs etc.,btohqsg
How are they related to property?,btohqsg
So that they donâ€™t get tax additional mah. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
The govt reduced the ltv to 75%  but guess what  the EC still sold like hot cakes  despite msr is only 30%,btohqsg
When it comes to tax  itâ€™s all up to gov and those behind it to drive.,btohqsg
Gst increase is a fair universal for all as example,btohqsg
Companies pay 30% absd for residential property,btohqsg
So what loophole u talking about,btohqsg
is one of your cars a X6M,btohqsg
i bet he uses bald tourador  rydanz and linglong  tyres for all 3,btohqsg
