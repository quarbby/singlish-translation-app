Yes. Actually they did decline in quality. Full of excuses now. Last time is no excuse work for people.,btohqsg
Didn't PAP's own Vivian say that WP is just like PAP just that WP is one step to the left during the debate?Hmmmm...,btohqsg
I believe the generation back then was the no excuse type,btohqsg
Thankful to LKY and his team then.  Not pap. Just because pap doesn‚Äôt mean standard same.,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt mean standard same forever . I don‚Äôt understand why government must force us buy insurance now. Though we already have. $900 a year isn‚Äôt cheap.,btohqsg
And why if got hdb first can have Any amount of private property. A lot ppl have hdb then buy 4-5 private property also can. Then if got private property cannot buy hdb . The rules all v unfair I feel,btohqsg
Ya. Rules should be amended. If u already have hdb  and wants to buy private  should give up ur hdb,btohqsg
Maybe another revenue for the government?,btohqsg
Are there a lot of such pple? With HDB and have ‚Äúa lot‚Äù of Pte Pty?,btohqsg
Yes there are  collecting rentals as passive income for their retirement needs,btohqsg
Ok bro  of course there are but not ‚Äúso many‚Äù lah,btohqsg
Anyway the issue is about pple abusing the HDB scheme.... of everybody one is not an abuse,btohqsg
Yeah u dunno but there are a lot,btohqsg
They stay in hdb and rent out their private property . And get Govt Payout still.,btohqsg
Because it‚Äôs not like hundred thousands la  but already got quite a number. Maybe 1000? As in  I feel rules are unfair.,btohqsg
And one more thing  why is Govt giving 238 million of foreigner to study here every year?,btohqsg
Actually to be frank  I am very worried about my offsprings in future. Even I sent to a lot of enrichments  I feel they won‚Äôt be protected and would not even survive here. Life is really hard  too many bills. Even go Uni debts. Foreigners come here got free Uni education til phd leh  and bond to guarantee them a job. And they still have to compete w foreigners. Sorry just ranting :( nowhere to rant,btohqsg
Volunteer as polling agent/counting agent dangerous anot ah? Many ppl gather tgt or got social distancing? ü§î,btohqsg
Paper maybe got virus üòÇ sneeze sneeze,btohqsg
Just a grand total of 1 000? Should be more than that,btohqsg
Now got so many U  last time only 2,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs why I say rules weird weird. Some ppl continue getting payout n utility vouchers though they stay at hdb (address park under hdb) but they own several private.,btohqsg
Yes I think should be more la... I scared pofma so I write lesser...,btohqsg
And these rich ppl are rich buy houses all over Bukit Timah area and get into these elite schools somemore.. elite schools... why their syllabus diff from us? Their sch fees $200 a month leh and also their teachers they sources themselves one and hire independent education consultant de.. u can ownself check.. we shouldnt allow this to happen..,btohqsg
For the past 2 yrs before convid19 economy start go downhill and PAP alway think economy it‚Äôs ok and allow more companies to hire forgein.Vote PAP Out or else our truth born Singaporean next generation are being replace by their import elites,btohqsg
So U are against rich people and not Govt right? Hahaha,btohqsg
No leh  I‚Äôm against unfair rules .,btohqsg
anyone know if i go to clinic for normal flu will they any mandatory mc?,btohqsg
lol no hammer or psp console,btohqsg
Primary schools all have equal low school fees. Secondary and above then have the few hundred dollar school fees. And there are very generous schemes to reduce the fees for lower and middle income students,btohqsg
I think u dunno much lol,btohqsg
Do u know nanyang primary school school fees are $200,btohqsg
Monthly. Bec their curriculum are different . Elite schools like nanyang primary school fees are $200 per month,btohqsg
Bec all these are parents told me,btohqsg
if not why so many want to send their kids to nanyang pri,btohqsg
https://beta.moe.gov.sg/fees-assistance-awards-scholarships/fees/I check already NYPS is $13 per month. Please show me a single primary school that charges more than $13 for Singapore Citizens.,btohqsg
Min score is 250 in 2019  discount from 261 lah,btohqsg
I dunno about u  but neighbours around me go raffles  nanyang primary ok. They said their school fees are $200,btohqsg
Eh I do relief teaching at some schools  sad to say the equipment a lot spoilt üòÇ,btohqsg
But only secondary schools are independent.  Your neighbors child PR or not,btohqsg
No is not. The facilities v jialat. In classrooms the projectors are spoilt   old n rusty. Even toilets ar spoilt can‚Äôt even flush... In contrast  the more branded schools I went the place are really very awesome. If u all got a chance  go visit first:),btohqsg
It‚Äôs not. Gg to elite schools really got advantage. Even cca is different. Xx  holiday enrichment even got jewellery design  fashion design etc. They even invite president over for motivational camps annually.,btohqsg
Primary school got this kind meh? Should sec and JC bah,btohqsg
I chanced upon their newsletter la,btohqsg
It‚Äôs primary.. anyway I‚Äôm just stating matter of fact  bec a lot of things u all dunno.. unless u personally know ppl teaching there or students studying there,btohqsg
Actually what‚Äôs the issue? In every society there will be such things,btohqsg
But then the gifted and talented poor people got less chance to shine lor. And then we talk so much about meritocracy. Is it real?,btohqsg
If u are gifted  there is a gifted program otherwise just have to wait till PSLE,btohqsg
Now is a lot better   really,btohqsg
Last time is if u have other talents than getting good grades  u are finished!,btohqsg
PAP is getting very real already,btohqsg
A few of their candidates came from normal streams,btohqsg
Last time  we never see such candidates from PAP,btohqsg
Then there is a ‚Äúsecond‚Äù best choice which is to join those dialect associations and volunteer etc,btohqsg
Still have a lot of choices,btohqsg
So what‚Äôs your point   gifted fren?,btohqsg
That there are definite improvements with top schools around 15 years ago. But nothing exotic like what is mentioned here. Maybe times have changed,btohqsg
Only for PR to foreigners .,btohqsg
Miscellaneous is $6.50 for all in primary,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs similar price to the 80s,btohqsg
Whistleblower from People‚Äôs Association shares document on plan to prepare Singaporeans for influx of foreigners - The Online Citizenhttps://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/2020/07/08/whistleblower-from-peoples-association-shares-document-on-plan-to-prepare-singaporeans-for-influx-of-foreigners/,btohqsg
Omg! If CCS and PA don't respond means its true,btohqsg
Selling out our country and citizens,btohqsg
Cos these foreigners are cream of the crop. Talent to be  can convert to pr or Singaporean.,btohqsg
Yes. 5 days must stay home.,btohqsg
Temasek Holdings delay financial results for FY 2020 ending 31 mar 2020 intending to take 1/2 a year to announce results by delaying announcing till Sept.,btohqsg
PA is non political party and stat board. Why never respond to this?,btohqsg
How come they never respond sia???,btohqsg
They are openly saying we going to get displaced,btohqsg
All PAP voters know that US President drawing USD500k (about SGD$700k)  But I didn't know whether the know our Singapore Minister is drawing more than double of US President?Actually we have more 18 Minister post in Singapore  if  all Ministers are as talented than the US President and why must Singaporean voters voted and allow to waste so much money to have so many talented ministers in small country compare to United state of America only need to pay one President at the cost of USD500k?,btohqsg
People on Reddit agree that this can be published 10/20 years ago and be accurate. It's not saying anything particularly different from what we face now. Also the publishing date was 15 Jan  before virus. Nothing to do with dorms in neighbourhood,btohqsg
You can go google and see there was such a PA seminar this year at Wisma Geylang Serai...,btohqsg
No response from PA - a stat board - looks very bad still,btohqsg
Still remember below incident... (Bias)... News @ AsiaOneNo further action against Tin Pei Ling: PoliceMs Tin allegedly posted a comment on her Facebook page on Cooling-Off Day. A complaint was lodged against her by Ms Nicole Seah of the National Solidarity Party. -AsiaOneWed  Aug 10  2011AsiaOneThe Singapore Police Force said in a statement today that no further action will be taken against Marine Parade GRC Member of Parliament Tin Pei Ling.She allegedly posted a comment on her Facebook page on May 6  Cooling-Off Day.The comment read: 'OooOoooOooh! so that's what REALLY happened? Wow. I think tears in Parliament is worse than ANYTHING ELSE,btohqsg
This one u must ask the Commender today sure no reply lah üòÇ,btohqsg
Are u telling everyone honest and upright official have nothing to eat at all? üòÇ,btohqsg
I mean the rest of the officials in US. not just the president gets paid.,btohqsg
Which officials paid in us is higher than the us president don't say other than the Singapore minister.,btohqsg
This has been said and debated many times. Yes our monsters are paid more.,btohqsg
That's a fact. No point keep bitching about it. Unless you want to form yr own party and change the way it is,btohqsg
This is what the use of having do many millions dollars talented can do in such an island big country. Whereby when u work for any firm if u drawing let say 10k per month and u can't bring revenue more than what u worth for  do u think  your boss will keep on doing charity by keeping u?,btohqsg
You are right. Thing is their KPI is not for profit. Can't measure in such a way.,btohqsg
anw they are elected ministers by the people. Don't keep looking on the bad side. Not PAP supporter here.,btohqsg
Go for Private biz if u want to be rich or high pay  don't come to politics for get a wealth... This why I don't respect them.,btohqsg
Not all go for the money but to really serve the people? again I'm not speaking for them,btohqsg
don't stereotype and put all bad eggs in 1 basket la,btohqsg
they are trying their best too to make our nation a better place,btohqsg
I won't form politic party as first I know my health is no good and lastly I love to earn big money by doing private biz unlike the current govt...lol,btohqsg
Corruption or cash-for-access is more common overseas. Donate to political party  can have dinner or even phone number. US politicians spend a lot of time flying around to attend political fundraising dinners. After retirement can earn 5/6 figures giving a single speech.Here the politicians pay for all their meals. Guest of honour for events then get free meal after giving short speech. Most ministers retire permanently except a few like George Yeo,btohqsg

But I think those who voted for Jamus & WP are ok with minimum wage.  Which is good too.  We need to help the lower income people.  We can pay $8 for meepok to help the cleaners.  We can also pay $3 for a hotdog bun in Breadtalk to help the bakers and salespersons.,btohqsg
We should also increase the conservancy tax  maintenance tax and town council fees by at least $50 per month.  We need to have minimum wage to help the minority like cleaners and refuse collectors.  We need to help the poor ya.,btohqsg
Thats why I said many singaporeans dont know we are high tax because we have many hidden tax that people did not include. Someone did the sums and found that we are about the same as other high tax countries,btohqsg

I nvr complain we lousy  I just asking about CPF. This call complaining? Hahahaha,btohqsg
Check on ownself first. Before you compare  look at the mirror first.,btohqsg
Maybe this policy is a bit aged... come to think of it since this is a knowledge workers economy..... all should be be equal contribution,btohqsg
I think last time was to improve the employability of older age workers,btohqsg
Yes  I think they should revamped this portion. Since singapore is facing age population..,btohqsg
Now the retirement age is in the 60s... good time to review the whole thing,btohqsg
You logincpf.gov.sgdon‚Äôt have your name? You can‚Äôt pay your children school fees w CPF? You can‚Äôt pay your housing loan w CPF? You go hospital you can‚Äôt use medisave from CPF?,btohqsg
CPF isn't really a straight forward thingy. Yes  we use it to buy flat  pay for med expenses  so & such  but we may never get it in hand. That bulk of cash accumulated over the years. Look at how the retirement age kept on extending endlessly til we dun even know when we'll be able to 'use it in our way'. I could be wrong in this but that's how i learnt through other ppl's explanations ü§î,btohqsg
The answer is rather simple .... special account is for your annuity and Medisave is for your medical,btohqsg
The Govt wun want to have all these as a burden hence this forced savings,btohqsg
Well maybe they will relax it one day to say if u can show certain assets in your bank and u sign away any request to Govt to support u if u run out of money,btohqsg
They willGive u all/more of the CPF at age 55,btohqsg
Your money all put in CPF?,btohqsg
Employees and Employer CPF portion inside CPF. Why?,btohqsg
Can you take out and use?You ask the elderly  how many can use medisave during hospital visit. Go and do ground check. Don't just talk name on paper.Housing loan using CPF  u pay how long? Stupid. After HDB lease over  is still not ur house. Stupid. Pay to wall or throw to sea?,btohqsg
Wow  used ‚Äòstupid‚Äô your so great then talk to yourself,btohqsg
Honestly i don‚Äôt even need CPF  monthly income is good enough for me,btohqsg
All under your name on paper. In the end  is it yours? Just a paper and name can scam you already. Simple minded.,btohqsg
20% into CPF  80% put where? 80% used to eat? Gamble? Go holidays?20% CPF if for you to save  buy house  your hospitalization expenses and retirement.   Interest in CPF is so much higher. Up to 6%.Bank interest is 0.01%.  I rather have some in CPF and some in bank.Many 55yo take CPF and then spent of China Dollies. Within a few months  sleep on the streets because kenna kick out by wives. Then how,btohqsg
Good for you  pray hard your monthly income is forever.,btohqsg

Ask u guys something. Last time our parents can buy 2nd bto. The extra cash from the sale of the first bto can keep right? No need put back cpf right?,btohqsg
U can keep the cash proceeds if any,btohqsg
Then minus CPF usage with accrued interest,btohqsg
Den when ur parents die..and u have a hdb of ur own le. Den the hdb of ur parents must sell right?,btohqsg
Sell le den anything extra also go to the children right,btohqsg
The hdb is not urs. But the extra money is urs right?,btohqsg
And funny enough...u actually didnt deserve the extra cash..u just stay there only. Is it even ur credit that ur hdb goes up in value?,btohqsg
Just talking to pple who complain abt cpf n hdb,btohqsg
So who will get scam today?,btohqsg
Hi guys  new here. Dunno where to post but does anyone has this soft toy uhh?,btohqsg
Looking for it for years ... if anyone have I‚Äôm willing to pay for it. Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
And it goes back to your CPF for the next house,btohqsg
OkLah I think maybe the board should look at individual cases and allow pple to borrow from CPF for someShort term usage depending on the individual ability to repay and purpose etc,btohqsg
This accrued interest thing keeps coming up,btohqsg
Aiyah. Why talk so much about CPF. Cash is king. üòè,btohqsg
Because they didn‚Äôt understand it goes back to their CPF to earn more money and they can use it for house and annuities,btohqsg
Not just use ur own cpf money meh? It's not a loan wat,btohqsg
Can link? Paiseh I din follow the convo,btohqsg
I was referring to using ur cpf  e.g u got 150k  to pay off lump sum. The loan  is you take outside with bank somewhere,btohqsg
Btw  is it common to take 'cpf loan' this way? Does this scheme has a name or something,btohqsg
I would agree with your point on this,btohqsg
Then how to borrow from cpf board  as u said?,btohqsg

cannot imagine.putting money in bank is like an investment.. low risk  low return.unlike the money in cpf its more like buying a long savings plan that is mandatory to take up once you start contributing to society.,btohqsg
cpf to protect lower end of the spectrum. worse case scenario. like ppl getting scammed or making the wrong investment choice or career failures  heavy medical bills etc..it benefit ppl in that area with something to fall back on.to well to do and financially educated ppl of cos it wont make sense because they are able to do so much more with it.,btohqsg
CPF is different things to different people.To the rich people  cpf is very good  it is an investment tool. They can either take out the cpf to invest  or alternatively the cpf becomes a long term high yield bond investment portion of their portfolio. Since they comfortably exceed the minimum sum  at 55 they are delighted that they can draw out a hugh sum of money.To the poor people  cpf is very bad  it is a nightmare because it becomes almost like a tax. With hardly enough money even for day to day expenses  every cent counts and it is a nightmare that such a heavy cut is taken away from their salary. At 55 they also cannot take out the money that is supposed to be theirs (except 5k) which they desperately need for their survival. To these people cpf is not their money  it is like a tax.  The rich will never understand this and thats why we see so much controversy and disagreements over cpf.,btohqsg
Having said that  the policy is that poorer pple are less capable to take care of themselves financially BUT beg steal borrow buy  everyone needs to survive and besides food  shelter is essential and retirement income hence the CPF scheme,btohqsg
But of course the CPF is a constant steam of funds for Govt to use/invest,btohqsg
Should have made CPF simpler. Take everything at certain age. How u spend your money is up to individuals. We don't need govt to advise us how we should use or plan our money.,btohqsg
Later no money for old age becomes a social problem,btohqsg
Help one must help 1 000,btohqsg
They dun want papers to report we have social problems or let international circles look down on us right?,btohqsg
To say that people will anyhow spend their own money and create social problem is kind of nonsensical excuse  it seems their objective is to lock up people's money for their own use,btohqsg
Ok then there is ONLY one way to change it :)))) and yes many pple have spoken up,btohqsg
If you are in power  don't abuse it. Making new policies to beautify your portfolio is selfish. You should walk the ground  feel the lives of citizens and attend to their needs. Then you will earn our respect.,btohqsg
Then all companies must do this,btohqsg
Which yes they can if they want to  create a company provident fund etc...,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just like the 10% service charge right???,btohqsg
If I eat a 20 steak Vs a 80 steak at the same restaurant  why do I pay more? It‚Äôs just the convention,btohqsg
Ie if companies behave this way  hopefully we hve a choice to select other companies,btohqsg
This happens everywhere..... isn‚Äôt it? Some people just like to invent jobs,btohqsg
I dun have much more to say ..... CPF is here to stay.... no one is asking us,btohqsg
Either we deal with it or the door is there,btohqsg
There are people who dun need CPF  it‚Äôs true but many do need it though allOf us prefer not to have the system,btohqsg
But if dun have this system   we also can‚Äôt get our employers will pay us the 17% extra,btohqsg
I always believe that we shouldn't make things difficult for others  be it you're in power or not. You want to make new policy  can. But don't make life harder. This is especially so for our pioneer generation. With so much changes in CPF  I don't think many are enjoying their retirement years.,btohqsg
I think the Pioneer Gen not affected,btohqsg
Where else can you get guaranteed 4% interest rates these days? Dump in SA also good. Can get the money back if confirm emigrating permanently also.,btohqsg
Hahah see  this is very true,btohqsg
But pple will say it‚Äôs one way traffic  can go in but can‚Äôt get out,btohqsg
Ok lah for a forced scheme in SGD  it‚Äôs the best Liao,btohqsg
I rather believe it should be call Corrupted Party Fund as we don't know how much left behind and the actual figure invested and also don't know actual balance of the national reserved annually! Very sad sad sad!,btohqsg
I think that cpf is a good idea tbh... BUUUUTTTTTT......  I think setting a minimum sum is a killer for most ppl like what some ppl had said on this thread  if u r able to hit the minimum sum it‚Äôs all rainbows n sunshine but if u r not aniwae near it it‚Äôs the other end of the spectrum of doom n gloom,btohqsg
My parents are 1 very good example of this as my dad has been working for 40 years n still does to this day he has hit the minimum sum when he was 55 n now at 62 he‚Äôs able to take out a large portion comfortably to renovate the house n to tide us over this period as long as we spend prudently,btohqsg
My mum on the other hand has been a housewife since she was 33 n has not work since then so her cpf is stuck at that amt + yearly interest now she‚Äôs 58 but she‚Äôs not able to take out a single cent due to the minimum sum limit of coz not saying that she‚Äôs needs the $$$ but I think it would be good if she is able to take at least a small portion whenever she wants to ( not talking bout the 5k) instead of struggling to hit even the basic sum,btohqsg
My dad n I used to joke with her that since we r the only 1s currently working that when either of us are dead   she will be rich ahahaha but do we really want to come. To this point ?,btohqsg

From what I read u have the option of nominations either through cpf or through cash so when u pass on all the proceeds from cpf will go to the nominated person,btohqsg
N it takes a bloody Long time to get the cpf $$$$,btohqsg
That‚Äôs y they (cpf board) encourage nomination,btohqsg
I m more worried bout the minimum sum though at 30 right now I have the next 25 years ( assuming the gov won‚Äôt CX lah) to earn enough hopefully to reach the minimum sum at that time,btohqsg
But even then a few hundred k might sound like peanuts by that time,btohqsg
COVID Party . Maybe should ban these people from getting free medical care,btohqsg
Ya. Maybe by that time  Singapore collapses with all the fake news unchecked,btohqsg
It's based on compound interest what. If your income hits 6k at sooner or later you will be able to hit the Full Retirement Sum for your cohort before 55  and can withdraw the excess thenUnfortunately for housewives people didn't put savings from household allowance in CPF earlier  so now there's a problem,btohqsg
Hahahahah all this calculations are based on current gov increases the past 10 yrs which is pretty accurate coz there was no global health crisis this past decade but I believe for COVID 19 as Long as there is no vaccine n with global recession ongoing it will take more than the next decade for the economy to start picking up again.... with that all said who can predict that the gov will decided on a much higher minimum sum in the future.... of coz this r all hypothetical but thx for the input! It‚Äôs comforting to see that the millennials n future generation are taking interest in current affairs,btohqsg
Won‚Äôt collapse lah but if the gov continue using pofma to prevent Oppo opinions on certain issues u will have a totalitarian state where the pap rule with an iron fist... rmb history where hitler rule over Germany n they had the secret police in place n back then even w/o internet ppl were encouraged to report any form of dissent,btohqsg
I have nth against the pap but I do not like the way they have used the laws based on their needs or in their favour..... the way pofma was used in this election it was like free will on who will be charged or not based on what ‚Äúthey‚Äù tot as false not what is ACTUALLY false,btohqsg
You have nothing against the pap except pofma?  You sound as if they have been all good except one tiny speck  but they have been repeating and repeating the same kind of big brother bullying tactics for the past 50 years  you ignore all those?,btohqsg
Not in the way that u think I m most definitely not pro pap but nether m I pro Oppo I tend to be 1 of those sitting on the fence type but I do tend to keep myself up to date bout several issues i.e. watch live debates in parliament amongst other things. although mayb I have not express myself well n I do have issues with the gov but pofma is one of many including the reserved presidency.... I think almost every1 in this grp can agree that gutter politics is outdated n would like to see a clean campaign rather than 1 of smearing which happen a lot during this GE which is y I mention pofma earlier,btohqsg
There are no live debates in Parliament to watch fyi,btohqsg

"Guess I am late on this.  I just saw a re-post article (reposted by Logan Lim) of a pap supporter (name not given) who have read an article called ""I am Sengkang voter""  and the pap supporter shared his own reflections.So I search for this article ""I am Sengkang voter"" and found it  written by Mandy Teo.Both articles are good reads.",btohqsg
don't xia suey yourself. what he say is budget neutral means gahmen no need pay which is consistent with what he say. consumers pay higher price and earn more. money flow faster. too bad people like you never study economics just rant off.,btohqsg
Saw this in another group chat .. why influezer now promoting to be sugar babe ah,btohqsg
Not many influencers can earn $$. They only earn if they are engaged by companies if not they do earn at all. It is getting more competitive now as well. Seems like many people want to be influencers.,btohqsg

For Singaporeans to get a returns of up to 6%.  So much better than putting into banks with interest rates of 0.1%,btohqsg
Does anyone know how do i check my ntuc referral code?,btohqsg
I also agree that Jamus was only saying the WP manifesto is budget neutral for the government  not necessarily for Singaporeans  foreigners  SMCs and MNCs. Especially the top 10%The focus on budget neutral for the government is because the opposition is always asked to define how to find the money for increased social spending  despite having incomplete data to work with without FOIA,btohqsg
Yes ... so I think it‚Äôs good,btohqsg
Please look at the picture posted properlyNo one said it was not budget neutralONLY Jamus Lim forgotten to tell the voters before elections that the voters will pay instead of the government.Anyways I am not the one who did the poster. Jamus Lim is the originator of the sentences,btohqsg
It's budget neutral for the Budget  full stop.Other details in the manifesto increase revenue through progressive taxation.,btohqsg
It translate the cost to all consumers. FULL üõë,btohqsg
If Jamus Lim dares to say it  why are you denying it ?,btohqsg
It's 3/4 btw. I'm only pointing out that the focus is on budget neutral for the government.Other WP proposals include free public transport for seniors  more university places for Singaporeans  universal lease buyback for HDB  and no GST hike.WP proposals increase employment opportunities while keeping overall costs low. Reducing reliance on cheap foreign manpower also keeps prices low for locals.,btohqsg
But they didn‚Äôt say who is going to pay?Increase income tax for all Singaporeans?OrIncrease company tax ?Increase employment opportunities overseas because MNCs find Singapore too expensive to invest in?  Now many companies are shifting to Malaysia port and they began to fight with Singapore PSA.Many companies like Data Centre and IBM are thinking to shift to Vietnam and India because Singapore Labour is getting too expensive.Another group pf companies are going to China!Yippee! Increase salaries for all Singaporeans! In the Airü§£ü§£Talk is easy! Tell us how to do it! Show us the statistics!Economist right! My foot! I did my thesis in Economics also Do you know there is a dominant data and a dynamic data? Do you know what data does Jamus Lim used? Past Expired Data!Come on. This are lives that you are playing with! Lives of Singaporeans!,btohqsg
I am trying to be nice but I amNot stupid,btohqsg
Enjoy the raraBut rememberThe lives of many Singaporeans are at stakeEnjoy the fun,btohqsg
I think you are blowing it totally out of proportion. As Jamus said  the increase in prices due to min wage is likely to be quite small because it is spread over many people.  Yee JJ mentioned that a survey done has found that most people are agreeable to a small price increase to help the very low income people get a decent living wage.People are agreeable to GST increase to 9% which is a very big increase so no reason to complain about a very small increase to help the poor.To me a more relevant thing to complain is the very big fat millions dollar salaries of the top people  why complain about a small increase for the very poor?  It is ok to get millions salary and not ok to get $1300?,btohqsg
Anyone knows of any other talk cock channel?,btohqsg
Worker‚Äôs Party proposed this salary if you don‚Äôt know2010  MP salary was $10k  WP proposed an increase and wow  it increase to $16K.And the ministers‚Äô salary increase was comparable what WP proposed!If they proposed it and you voted for it  be nice to the increase too,btohqsg
Guys. Use this channel to get laid pls.,btohqsg
If we wan info? We can either wiki or google de,btohqsg
As far I remember  WP was saying that pap way of pegging ministerial salary to top private earners is excessive  so they proposed an alternative formula but then pap pointed out that wp formula works out to be same amount. For sure I would disagree with such amount  it does seem like WP is not aware  maybe they are working with insufficient info  in any case I would disagree with such high salaries.,btohqsg
But as far as giving a minimum living wage to the bottom income earners  I would agree with it  in fact even pap agrees with it  just that their way of implementation is different.,btohqsg
In you can remember  it was WP who proposed to relook as the salaries of the parliament members are too low,btohqsg
I prefer progressive wages which will help the lower income to justify the salaries increase and help employers understand the increase in pay.Now security officers average is about $1.9KCleaners are able to clock an increase in pay too,btohqsg
Anyways I am ok with opposition in parliament which I think it is good tooBut I am not ok when opposition just opposed without thinking properly and don‚Äôt even know the opposition leaders are the ones who called for the increase in MPs pays.Singaporeans need to know who asked for the increase of the parliament members salaries which is in this case the WP.  Why put the blame to PAP?  When PAP supports WP suggestions  they get whacked. When PAP don‚Äôt support WP  also get whacked.  This is a very bad climate.,btohqsg
As far I remember  WP has said minister salary is too high  they did not ask for increase,btohqsg
Anyway the topic of discussion now is for the bottom income earners,btohqsg
I am not ok that when people compare against different parties  they treat as if it is an equal fight between pap and opposition. It is never an equal fight  the oppo is so much disadvantaged  whereas pap is the gov and has all the power and resources,btohqsg
Worse are those that when oppo make some minor mistake it is totally blown out of proportion  but when pap make major mistakes it is ignored,btohqsg
Ôøº¬†Ôøº¬†July 19th  2020 |¬†Ôøº¬†Author:¬†ContributionsÔøºAfter reading the article on ‚ÄúI am a Seng Kang voter‚Äù and many other articles¬†on MSM  I had some reflections. For your information  I voted PAP all¬†my life as I was having good job and pay. I never told all my friends¬†who I voted  I pretended I don‚Äôt really care about who wins  as long¬†as my estate is well managed and water still flows.Actually I am quite aware of whats going on in Singapore  we are¬†surely moving to 6.9M or even 10M  it will come. I believe that¬†Singapore is a small country and we need more people to consume so¬†that the country will become prosperous with GDP growth. Of course  I¬†know whatever the government says or hints  it will happen and we¬†citizens no matter how much we complain or do those feedback  they¬†will still do what they want to do.I worked for IT MNC  I was middle management. Over the years  the¬†company had imported so many foreigners that now more than half were¬†foreigners and most are with PRs or new citizenships. It did not¬†affect my job  I collected by five figure a month happily. However ¬†last year the management changed  CECA imported aka new citizen became¬†my boss. And to cut the story short  that was end of my career  I was¬†pushed to limits and pressure forced me to resign. And my replacement ¬†you know better. I quitted my job believing that my knowledge and¬†skills would easily get me another one somewhere. Days turns into¬†months and I remained unemployed since. I used to think people who¬†voted oppositions are those complaint kings who are lazy and instead¬†of upgrading  they complain and complain; in my eyes these people are¬†standard opposition supporters. I went to WSG and E2i events  for your¬†information  they are useless for PMETs  they just want you to rewrite¬†CVs or do some low level menial jobs meant for lower secondary¬†education. Sometimes I wonder why experienced and knowledgeable PMETs¬†like us need to go upgrade to do a low level job while these third¬†world imports get high level jobs and live in condos?This whole event changed my world and life. Like those sheep at CHC  I¬†was in rude awakening  it took me time to reflect all these years of¬†blind faith and voting PAP  the trusted brand which keeps saying ¬†‚ÄùWith you  for you‚Äù every GE and leave no one behind. I applied for¬†jobs  most middle level jobs  you have at least 500 ‚Äì 1500 applicants ¬†many are foreigners  fighting for one vacancy. So I finally know what¬†is like to be unemployed  I could not imagine how these foreigners are¬†all here competing with locals.This election  I turned against PAP  the reason is obvious. After many¬†decades of voting PAP  this is my first time voting WP. I had blindly¬†trusted PAP for too long  too comfortable with my good job and pay. I¬†never really believed this 6.9M or 10M is going to affect me. Now I¬†had to caution all the local PMETs reading this to forward to all¬†other PMETs who maybe sleeping or used to having blind faith like me.¬†If we do not stand up to PAP earlier  eventually we will be hit or our¬†next generations will be hit.The MSM largely avoided the harsh truths of why voters are turning¬†against PAP  they are skirting answers because they want to keep us¬†dumb. I only changed my vote after I was hit. I agreed with most of¬†the reasons listed by Seng Kang voter  he got it right. I am one of¬†the blind faith and I know many of us are fearful of repercussion or¬†change.Will PAP change? Honestly  it will not  unless someone new is going to¬†take over and overhaul the system. The plan for 6.9M is certainly on ¬†I believe they will pretend to listen but will still do the same. So¬†the Seng Kang voter is right  we expect them to continue to import¬†more foreigners and convert  redrawing boundaries  more CPF changes¬†and blood sucking policies.I had trusted them for far too long  and I am asking all of you who¬†have not woken up to start thinking and till the next GE  we should¬†all go out and vote oppositions to stop them from destroying our lives¬†and country our forefathers built. Remember these foreigners did not¬†build this country  they came,btohqsg
in on VIP tickets  our lunches are¬†served on them. So for the sake of our future and next generation  we¬†need to vote more oppositions or end up like me.Ricky SeowÔøº¬†Posted,btohqsg
Problem in such messages is authenticity and vice versa,btohqsg
Some small mistakes that PAP made are too blown out of proportion,btohqsg
The issue is more onare Singaporeans consistent in1) Verifying news2) Treating PAP and WP as equals,btohqsg
And when WP (now the opposition leader) speaks   do they tell the whole truth?Same as PAP  what the truth is?If one doubt PAP  one must put the same doubt to WP.Must be fair and just,btohqsg
Like the Town council issueIf the one who was found corrupted in Town Council issues is to be jailed  it must be for both parties!Same for WP and same for PAP,btohqsg
I wish to see the same for all wards and political parties,btohqsg
I already touched on pt2  pap and oppo are not fighting on equal terms  oppo is far too disadvantaged,btohqsg
You want to talk about fair and just  then go tell pap to make the playing field fair and just first,btohqsg
Can u share what is unfair,btohqsg
I would like to know too,btohqsg
What is unfair is so widespread and in so many areas  impossible for me to answer in an open manner  for specific area we can discuss further. In a general way I already pointed out that pap is the gov and they have all the power and resources  oppo do not have such power and resources,btohqsg
For example  talk about the election  the oppo is so disadvantaged in many ways  if you cannot see it then I really dont know what to say,btohqsg
Like that i can also sayIt is so unfair! WP can get away with whatever they had done wrong but I can‚Äôt tell you in the open.Come on! Be open and say the truth. If you believe it is the truth.Since you had said  PAP had been unfair now. You can state the examples,btohqsg
That is what I feel the games played by oppositions,btohqsg
If it is the truth  say it! Show it and prove it!Be courageous,btohqsg
POFMA is when it is not the truth! If it is the truth  you won‚Äôt kenna POFMA,btohqsg
As far the election  the election dept is reporting to PM  the constituency boundaries are changed without reason and so late notice  timing of when the election is called  the short campaign period 9 days  all these and much more are obvious to the oppo disadvantage.  I dont think you are sincere in discussing what is fair to the oppo  I shall not waste further time,btohqsg
All these are not anything new  they have been talked about for years and years  yet you can claim ignorance  obviously you are not sincere in wanting to talk about what is fair to the oppo,btohqsg
"The onlinecitizen has an article ""Singapore elections are not fair  say ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights"" published 20 june 2020",btohqsg
Do a search and there is so much info on the unfair election process  so I dont believe you have no knowledge of all these,btohqsg
Actually I feel the ELD should be independent and consists of past politicians  current political lawyers  businessmen,btohqsg
Should not be affiliated to any one party,btohqsg
Or take instructions from people affiliated to any party,btohqsg
A person skilled in urban planning should lead the ELD,btohqsg
Omg you don‚Äôt know what are unfair and what are not on fair grounds ?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs explained the disconnect with the general population,btohqsg
The point WP made is that ministers salary should not have such a high variable bonus according to the growth of the economy  as it incentivises to a growth at all cost mentality. Politicians should be paid according to civil servant pay grades. This would have the side effect of ensuring that civil servant pay is updated regularly.,btohqsg
If you read their manifesto you would know their business friendly proposals  like incentives for companies who hire more Singaporeans than necessary for quota  subsidised rent on JTC and HDB properties  requiring interest on late payments by Govt to vendors  and abolishing retirement age.,btohqsg
lets discuss nicely..i believe both side must try to see the others' to avoid bubble and groupthink alsoPAP supporters must understand their side is not 100% right  and have to accept different ideasOpposition supporters have to understand PAP is not bad at all too  a lot of good men there...both bubbles must burst üòÅ,btohqsg
I also concur with HK's situation. I am earning 5 figure up to last year. Got laid off last year and approached SGUnited (or another related agency...cannot remember because their inter-structure is quite completed). Had one session with them and that is it. Gave me 3 resume samples and told me to be more active in LinkedIn to have higher chance of headhunter seeing my CV. That's it!!! Then this agency presumably get that commission from the govt. When I asked about jobs  they say can browse thru MyCareersFuture and look myself. Damn! Total waste of my time. Recently checked on my ex company  all the management level is foreigners  not a single local. Not sure how they managed to do it. All I know is that if they have a foreigner candidate already in the past they will still do the mandatory posting but will say no suitable candidates and then employ their own people.,btohqsg

I have no idea what you're asking here and there.https://aseanmp.org/2020/06/18/singapore-report-statement/is the report.

Ya I also think the same. If no pofma means not fake news,btohqsg

He is sayi because elections happened during COVID pandemic ... it is unfairThere are many countries very unfair ?How fair is Taiwan? They didn‚Äôt even test much of their populationWhen people died  they didn‚Äôt test whether it is COVID. They had elections too,btohqsg
South Korean is also having elections,btohqsg
Many to name and many more to comeWhy pick on Singapore alone,btohqsg
Maybe Singapore is a small countryEasy to bully üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
That's just the headline  other details like very short campaigning period while all activities had to be moved online  disincentives to vote opposition due to upgrading  lack of free media  exclusion of overseas  14 day SHN and QO voters,btohqsg
And as Singaporeans  we should ask him to fight in his own country,btohqsg
Singapore Campaigning period had changed ??Move to online knowing that Oppositions are very strong online !PAP must be trying to torture itself,btohqsg
PAP is only good for groundwork.. all their politicians only know how to work hard and hardly any is a good speaker.If PAP want to be unfair  should do after National Day.  Why do it when COVID numbers are the lowest? It is to protect Singaporeans!Election is a must. COVID pandemic can continue for years as in Spanish Flu which lasts for 3 years!Thus to do it when number is the lowest is very important.,btohqsg
I think PAP is torturing themselves by having elections now.  Stupid to the max,btohqsg
We are a leader in ASEAN. We need to set an example for democracy  while it's being attacked in our neighbours. We also should not keep silent when injustice occurs elsewhere  like the treatment of Rohingya.,btohqsg
Now you say we are leader in ASEAN.U must be jokingWhen Malaysia threatened us with water  did they treat us as leaders?When Malaysia places their navy ship into our waters  did they treat us like a leader?When Indonesia wants to shut down our air space  did they treat us like leader?When Taiwan detained our masks  did they treat us like leaders?When HK kept our tanks  did they treat us like leaders?Are you so naive ?,btohqsg
They were expecting 65% and got 61%  but now kpkb like it's a big loss. Simply be more humble and have a clean election and they wouldn't have issues.,btohqsg
I think more like Oppositions KpKBPAP even make WP the leader of Opposition and give them staff and resources to become leader of opposition.  Not good ?,btohqsg
Insecure leaders do sabre rattling  but our diplomacy in the civil service on both sides are level headed. We are undoubtedly a leader in ASEAN  which is where I'm talking about.,btohqsg
Lol.  On both sides?Nope! We are NOT the leader. Fat Hopes.Face the fact! Singapore is NOT the leader in ASEAN,btohqsg
The details are yet to be worked out. And it's only going to form the grounds for a two-party system for centrist politics through FPTP  instead of a healthy coalition with alternative voting methods,btohqsg
Make WP a leader of oppostion also got commentIt shows nothing is enough for you.Dunno who is KPKB,btohqsg
You still think they treat us like leader of ASEAN??,btohqsg
Yes  the civil servants in other countries are not stupid and can only follow instructions when their leaders make moves to appease their voters. Negotiations behind the scenes ultimately resolved these situations.We may not be the leader of ASEAN  but we are one of the leaders together with other half of the members who are stronger.,btohqsg
Like I said  the devil is always in the details. Other parties would have to depend on WP to get the information they need to craft policies  when we can simply have FOIA. This disadvantages academia as well.Electoral reform is always worth debating  the dangers of FPTP and a two party system like in the US are well known. Proportional representation would mean that we don't have to vote for jokers to support opposition,btohqsg
Lol.: you talk as if you are doing the negotiations tooCome on  if your definition of a leader is such  then everyone is a leaderI can tell you  our neighbors are waiting for the day where we can be destroyed la.Even when our currency is the strongest  they can even threaten to shut our air space and encroach our watersU wait long long that when we become weak  they won‚Äôt ‚Äúeat us up‚Äù,btohqsg
The problems with monkey see and monkey do is that all will eat peanutsYou can say one system fits for one country and another should followWhy don‚Äôt we follow China! On Government and everyone enjoys prosperity.  Now China is growing big  why don‚Äôt you say one Party is good?Come on. I am not even saying we must follow China!I am saying don‚Äôt oppose for the sake of opposing! Don‚Äôt vote for opposition just because you want two parties!Everyone voted in must be deserving because they are good and of certain standard!,btohqsg
I tell u who is good in WP,btohqsg
I think these two deserves a seat,btohqsg
Yes  ASEAN has 5-7 leaders  including Vietnam and Brunei. We're still a leader.There's good reason for other countries to be resentful of us. We are a prime destination for their top talent  ASEAN Scholarships as an example. It's a little predatory to incentivise their brain drain. We store the offshore funds of their rich  reducing their tax revenue.This currency thing Singaporeans are obsessed with is ridiculous. Japan and SK aren't weak nations even though their currency is weaker than ours.,btohqsg
I am happy that He Ting Ru is made to lead SK TC.  I think she should do well if she don‚Äôt make the same mistake of negligence,btohqsg
We can vote opposition to reduce the vote share of PAP in strongholds  or void our votes. The quality of opposition is already evident in the vote share of spoilt votes.,btohqsg
It is likeI want my wife to live me more and so I must get a mistress,btohqsg
I think maybe we should encourage man to have two wives.... then Can enjoy ma,btohqsg
If you're unhappy about POFMA  lack of FOIA and free media  gerrymandering and parachuted ministers  no apologies or engagement with civil societies  voting against the PAP is a way to show your displeasure if you're in a PAP stronghold. Why should they be entitled to a 60% vote share while comfortably enjoying a supermajority?I think I've made my point for the others to consider. Good night.,btohqsg
U seems to hate PAP? This is the worse reason to voteIt is likeI want my wife to love me deep deep and so I must have a mistress to check on her so that she will do my bidding,btohqsg
To be fairIf opposition corrupted  sack! Teach them to be goodIf PAP corrupted  also sack!Teach them to be goodMust be fair and shouldn‚Äôt bully WP or PAP.Singaporeans should be the People they serve and not we serve them to give them free cheque and free food!I still pissed with my TC $$$!!!!,btohqsg
eh  you sure bo? Former Ang Mo Kio Town Council general manager Wong Chee Meng got corruption case  but you want to vote out the entire AMK GRC including PM Lee? You anti-pap until like this ah?,btohqsg
If PM Lee did what Sylvia did  yes he must be out,btohqsg
Sylvia allowed blank cheques to her friends! Remember this,btohqsg
Remember it is WP own Town Council appointed members who sued WP,btohqsg
