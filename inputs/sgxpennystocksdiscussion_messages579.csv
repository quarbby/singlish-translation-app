If RS fly up‚Ä¶it will be massive. Now is see how much pain the shortist can tahan holding nia,btohqsg
Today PPEs will be strong to squeeze the shortists. But do remember to take profits n don't let greed's overtake u....for the demand of PPEs  especially gloves will not change much because of Omicron,btohqsg

How come SG didn't manage to catch it  since even transit passengers need to pre-test... Or they knowingly pass the ball over?,btohqsg
3 months from that announcement  on the deal. by right is last week friday isnt it,btohqsg
U say what I take it as u check Liao,btohqsg
Haha ok let‚Äôs pray gd news for matex,btohqsg
Goes to show it‚Äôs not easy to detect,btohqsg
Matex recent MOU updates on disposal of their wholly owned subsidiary stated that the purchaser added an additional 1m RMB deposit to get a 3 months purchase exclusivity whilst they continue their Due Diligence.Note that this MOU was signed on the 26th Aug 2021.Meaning to say that the 3 months exclusivity will end on the 26th Nov 2021 (this week friday)We should be expecting some action whether the 50m RMB purchase deal  finalises or not. Reason being Matex share price clearly have not factored in any run up and with the recent rights issue at $0.027 being the psychological base   the risk reward here can be pretty amazing.Let‚Äôs see how this one unfolds.The recent PA looks positive to me  feels like some early accumulation already by some players and if so  4 series should be an easy reach,btohqsg
PCR still works  no reports on ART yet,btohqsg
3 months exclusivity ends for the MOU to do the DD ended last friday but no update on how the deal is coming along...,btohqsg
UG still have heavy buying toward the last 30min before closing,btohqsg
illiquids not really in favour now leh,btohqsg

Why Pfizer just can't gap up like moderna,btohqsg
Because Pfizer never pay the news media enough to pump out good news,btohqsg

Actually maybe can look at AZN leh,btohqsg
Iirc they weren't charging high for their vax cos they want poorer ctys to be able to afford,btohqsg
But read a few days ago they planning to raise prices alr,btohqsg

Pfizer might come out news like moderna they also go new vaccine,btohqsg

Zoom and Netflix downTomorrow gloves and medtech down,btohqsg
This one is they drawn up the scenario of possibility‚Ä¶we still have no conclusion yet üòë,btohqsg
Hopefully it‚Äôs does not cause severe health symptoms as they predicted,btohqsg
When virus more infectious mean end of cycle,btohqsg
I give an example la‚Ä¶if kena aids  the symptoms doesn‚Äôt show immediately  it took years before the symptoms show. Some virus effect doesn‚Äôt show up immediately.,btohqsg
That's why can spread so insidiously..,btohqsg

Zoom video price drop tell you the story,btohqsg
Zoom video drop is because of the limited growth. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrongs,btohqsg
Do you think Glove counters and Medtech can have unlimited grow ?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not saying they have unlimited growth.,btohqsg
I just don‚Äôt understand why you so uptight about it dropping?,btohqsg
Because when they are up then our medical counters in sgx up,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt really see the correlation to it. But not much discussion can be done currently. Just see tomorrow. Don‚Äôt have to worry so much if you didn‚Äôt buy or short.,btohqsg
SGX is all BBs play. ü§£,btohqsg
let me share some interesting numbers.... MEDTECS NAV $0.47  cash $0.16 .... last traded price is $0.50,btohqsg
When US market green and no fear Omicron then let see tomorrow sgx,btohqsg
Last q financial report profit drop to only 1 million,btohqsg
it is trading at around 1x book value... you call that grossly overvalued?,btohqsg
How about next year still can sell more or increase ASP?,btohqsg
so according to your logic  need to sell more or increase ASP than can buy?,btohqsg
sure it will sell less and ASP will decrease. but i bought at around 30 cents  way below its book with half of its market cap comprising of cash.,btohqsg
I can buy BYD PPE or Temasek also bought BYD PPE cheap and good,btohqsg
After all no moat don‚Äôt bet,btohqsg
I like to bet when it was very Low but not now 50cents,btohqsg
fyi  most of our hospitals and healthcare institutions are using MEDTECS products,btohqsg
that i see it with my own eyes,btohqsg
The free medical and N95 masks I received from Temasek was from BYD,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt matter really. The real play already done last year  people already bought house  changed car from MT.Now is just dead cat bounce to trap more people. Just don‚Äôt get caught when it comes back down,btohqsg
Depends on how they going to utilize their cash for future growth,btohqsg
Now is good for trading  intraday trading or few days trade etc,btohqsg
For public they give other brandFor healthcare professionals   they use MEDTECS products,btohqsg
Medtech last financial report very bad  ASP down  profit merely 1 million.Do you think this Omicron makes them make profit as last year?,btohqsg
Yes. I agree that it is unlikely to go up to the high of $2 again...But to spout nonsense that medtecs is grossly overvalued when it is trading at around 1x book with tons of cash in its balance sheet... I think the person must be either uninformed or salty,btohqsg
Frankly I see UG gloves in hospital lol,btohqsg
They didn‚Äôt pay interim dividend after reports,btohqsg
speaking of Medtec what happen if they leave the small cap catalyst index?,btohqsg
do the institution have to sell their holdings?,btohqsg
Can use YZJ as textbook references maybe,btohqsg
i rmb zane share they are leaving this friday,btohqsg
Only thing is we dunno how big the funds exposure they have on MT,btohqsg
I feel the effects maybe minimal,btohqsg
Funds could have long thrown when it start go downward from $1 to $0.40,btohqsg
they have a lot of control on the ask and bid queue. at least that is for sure,btohqsg
I will hold till tomorrow .. üòÇ,btohqsg
Omicron save all the glove counter .. üòÇ,btohqsg
After Omicron donno still have what viruses come out again,btohqsg
Tomorrow open . Chase glove counter !!!,btohqsg
Wanted to add UG at $0.40 but no chance‚Ä¶price actions was moving too fast,btohqsg

Today can rebound medical PPE stock bor,btohqsg
Key thing is by feb 2022 how fast omicron spread,btohqsg
Hope sg bo omicron  if not jialat,btohqsg
More worry about the seriousness of the new variant then transmittability. Best case scenario it become mild and takeover the delta strain  become another flu strain.,btohqsg
More  transmit more chance mutate  hope it kill itself the best scenario,btohqsg

As purchasing power lags behind price inflation,btohqsg
üç±Pika World Lunch Break ‚Äì 30 November 2021ü•ëMarkets ushered into a strong recovery on Monday on a backdrop of more positive news on the effects of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. It appears that after the initial knee-jerked reaction  investors are heartened with the mild symptoms reported globally.As we reviewed the scenario  we believed there are reasons for optimism.#1: Friday was a poor liquidity dayIndeed  when the stunning news dropped its bomb on investors  the market was trading in a shortened session. While selling pressure is high  there are few buyers since many would have gone for Thanksgiving weekend.For example  the number of shares that changed hand for SPY ETF was 59 million  much lesser than the 70 million seen in previous days. It is also much lower than the 150 million peaks we visited in the second half of the year.#2: Poor reflection of DemandAs low volume persists through the trading session  it becomes a poor indicator that demands for shares will be weak in the days ahead. Moreover  since many market participants were not in the market  their absence means a more considerable discount on the news.#3: Monday  a strong comebackIndeed  we have seen firm buying action on Monday given the good news from the weak nature of the variant based on the assessment of patients. This helped to push Nasdaq up by 2% while the Dow climbed by 0.9%. While S&P 500 rose by 1.5%. It reflects the confidence in the market  consistent with our weekend update. Given that Moderna is confident to roll out its improvised vaccine by early 2022  there is plenty of good news baked in the market on Monday.And with that  it is hopeful that the economy keeps growing.We hope you enjoy this read.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg
