Ya I read the same thing when OCBC first have fixed deposit for CPF OA. not sure whats the difference after factoring the admin fee and the 1 to 2 months of not earning the CPF interest. Not sure if it's worth the effort to go to the bank and do all these,btohqsg
Seems like this is another credit card program in addition to IRAS GIRO monthly instalment. So should be no impact on 1% cash back on GIRO payment.,btohqsg
Coming march. No need to go bank anymore. Can do it via Internet banking,btohqsg
Main thing still don't know how much difference I can get if I put in the OCBC FD üòÇ,btohqsg
It's not only that. U just go read JT article,btohqsg
Based on previous calculations. To earn profit in either T bills or other investment tools using cpf oa. The return must be higher then 2.9%.,btohqsg
To me. Anything higher than 2.9%. Its a profit and bonus to me. This money is sitting in cpf oa like a lazy bum bum. So  make it work for you.,btohqsg

Be honest with your monthly. See whether the card fits your monthly expenditure. Usually UOB One + UOB EVOL is ok already. UOB EVOL min spend is $600 a month.,btohqsg
Just try any one u fancy  read up each card tnc  see which aligns to your lifestyle,btohqsg
