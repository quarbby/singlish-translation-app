Yah the shitter diesel quality isnt good for our sg diesel,btohqsg
Sg diesel is euro V min,btohqsg
And it dirties up the car. I pump wrong before,btohqsg
Then go servicing the hose and all rabak need clean,btohqsg
Just rent a car for phv use,btohqsg
Yah  u drive PHV  Wear and tear increase  servicing freq also increase. Road tax also u ownself pay.,btohqsg
pumping msia 97 instead of 95,btohqsg
based on the fact that your whole charade of transfering fuel takes time,btohqsg
and you have to buy msia car,btohqsg
and your savings are only $11 per day eh,btohqsg
Buy own car  borrow loan cheaper,btohqsg
7300 depre per year which car 80l,btohqsg

later you tow to petrol station added cost,btohqsg

Isnt xc90 an SUV? OF ALL CARS u use an SUV for PHV?!,btohqsg
Lemme correct myself. A CONTI SUV?,btohqsg
I support in wiping your tears when you realise using a high a f FC suv is a great idea for PHV,btohqsg
Bro i laughed so hard at this,btohqsg
are you sure your name isn't half of the drug$ you're on,btohqsg
If ur car needs to go over to msia to pump ron 95  just for you to make profit as a PHV driver  i dun really think its suitable.,btohqsg

Hello  by any chance are there any Toyota C-HR owners in here?Just wanted to check if anyone knows of a workshop where I can get my daylight running lamps + rear taillights resolved for inspection.Context:Went for inspection previously and failed because:1. DLR of wrong light hue (abit yellow (?))2. LED rear taillights instead of actual reflectors- looking to get them back to stock covers (unless someone knows of another solution)Thankssss!,btohqsg
See if C-HR community got any helpful owners?,btohqsg
DLR: can just switch off? shouldn't be a cause of failure but I don't know lah. Rickshaw rules I know better,btohqsg
Dont know of any C-HR communities hahaha,btohqsg

Mitsuoka dealer just under sgcm office also,btohqsg
outta curiousity  anyone here ever bought a car through a in-house loan at a second hand dealer instead of a bank loan   how was it like ?,btohqsg
You wanna take in house loan ah,btohqsg
Nah im just asking cause i want know all these so in future i wont be get scammed into shit when i actually want buy car lol,btohqsg
For starters  read the terms if you're getting an in house loan,btohqsg
And take bank loan if you can,btohqsg
Easiest ways to not get scammed,btohqsg
to me most important is interest rate and early repayment,btohqsg
Normally those interest   is there a max they can go up to or they can just increase to any amount they want,btohqsg
sometimes they dont follow rule of 78,btohqsg
In house loans is upto them usually,btohqsg
Like banks  they also judge your profile,btohqsg
Oh so its never ever fixed   but they will give a rate based of your profile ?,btohqsg
Someone with a name of gilbert trying to scam someone,btohqsg
Profile  price of the car  how much you down  their mood,btohqsg
If it was pak imran's nasi padang  maybe give you 0.8% less,btohqsg
Im geussing the lesser you downpay the higher the percentage they gonna give,btohqsg
https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/car-loan-interest-secretly-double-seemssharing this so you better understand the difference between car loans vs home/personal loans,btohqsg
Wait. How long down the road are we talking about sir?,btohqsg
HAHAHAH I purposely posted this listing here to test water 🥹 - E,btohqsg
Erm.. you’re testing your own water ma’am. who does that!!!! Hahahahhaha,btohqsg
bank die die won't give me approval one,btohqsg
so i'm at their mercy (in house loan) for interests rates,btohqsg
You know your current interest rate?,btohqsg
it's hard to survive in singapore when u know u are deep in shit,btohqsg
i dun want to trouble others also,btohqsg
As long as credit line still have mah!,btohqsg
so jus go ahead use my own name lor,btohqsg
nope. i dun have credibility with the banks anymore,btohqsg
I’m paying off my own $213 debt from bank .. still have $17.82 left. But bank say still willing to lend me $50 more if I need,btohqsg
and to answer if the credit company aka house loan  it all depends on how much u loan,btohqsg
anyway  i tried and it failed,btohqsg
and the inhouse will inflate the selling price of the car,btohqsg
Only Admin E does that haha - E,btohqsg
But then it's a two-seater tho :(,btohqsg
They should give you better deal coz they get incentive from bank,btohqsg
but i first timer.. so damn naive,btohqsg
i will be smarter and know what to get the next time,btohqsg
anyway  my ah lau is saying to review one year late,btohqsg
But your car you never low dp right,btohqsg
That’s what we are here for.,btohqsg
Okay so if you sell also won’t be a problem,btohqsg
haha...novice will need to pay for tuition fee,btohqsg
and also to lower the monthly repayment figure  hopefully,btohqsg
A lot of lao jiao here who can help buyers or sellers like you avoid pitfalls,btohqsg
Cannot cover all ground coz one can never say never but we try lah,btohqsg
Wah so if inhouse they will up the car price ah,btohqsg
it all depends how much you gonna loan and how much dp,btohqsg
if u can come up with like 30percent of dp  naturally the loan amount will be lower and they no need to inflate the price,btohqsg
But if i pay lesser than that,btohqsg
I almost read Lao as lan,btohqsg
They will play with the price ?,btohqsg
Like increase the price of the car  because you pay less than 30,btohqsg
To help you get bank loan for low dp,btohqsg
And that also means they will increase the interest percentage higher than if i were to pay 30 percent,btohqsg
What is the car interests rates these days? 3%,btohqsg
bank loan is 2. something right?,btohqsg
but different in house  diff rates,btohqsg
so if the car dealer knows a few credit facilities  tell him'/herto try all of them,btohqsg
So we should be seeing lesser cars registered unless there are really many cash rich folks buying without taking up loans,btohqsg
yah diff. urs 3.xx low alr  i hear some is close to 4% or 4.xx,btohqsg
But in house the interest is fixed throughout your repayment period or does it change,btohqsg
Based on the contract  fixed upon sign-up,btohqsg
Lucky my previous car and current car under Hong Leong... that time on April my current car was under promo of 1.68% or 1.78% under Hong Leong...,btohqsg
buying car now is almost like buying a house,btohqsg
Yeah man... I bought used vezel was depre under $11k and monthly was $843...,btohqsg
except that car loans are not compound interests,btohqsg
now can buy house meh? 1million dollar HDB nowadays...,btohqsg
Yup... must see the interest high or low... machiam stocks...,btohqsg
no meh? the interests rate so hiong,btohqsg
Welp   dk in like 5 years how the market is gonna be like,btohqsg
those who predict that coe will come down next year  hopefully the rates will follow downwards also,btohqsg
Heng nia... now used one depre already up from more than $12k and above... mine was 2016 Dec car...,btohqsg
It is already calculated for the period in compounded factor,btohqsg
"almost every sales person i see kept saying ""we foresee the coe will keep going up""",btohqsg
i buy an elantra in 2020  monthly 611 only,btohqsg
Used cars are priced based of current COE right because since coe so high the used car demand also high,btohqsg
wa now buy car is the worst time..,btohqsg
Hopefully whatever car i want still exist when i can afford one lol,btohqsg
2 years ago very less depre... I traded in my opc 2019' Jan Note... lugi about 3 years plus coe...,btohqsg
i sold my elantra during this surge  after selling and driving for 2 years.. my depre total 5k only LOL,btohqsg
You heng ar... hahas... I also forgot the Note depre how much after driving for 3 years...,btohqsg
That time dealer under promo plus my friend was the dealer...,btohqsg
So I sold to his company lo... the owner already earned... the Note already upgraded exhaust and air filter plus already tuned as well...,btohqsg
What can be worse if not getting an EV soon when every hdb are getting more ev parking lots meant to reserve for their purpose? So that itself push up the ownership cost.,btohqsg
Sound system only took back my player... rest in the old car...,btohqsg
yalor...i was hoping can buy cars using cpf,btohqsg
Now I focus on selling my house and upgrading as well...,btohqsg
why can;t the government just allocate cars per household,btohqsg
limit to one household = 1 or 2 cars,btohqsg
I think someone explained this here,btohqsg
i had a discussion w someone about it a few days ago,btohqsg
i mean it makes more sense,btohqsg
Cause it’s not really us driving it up,btohqsg
Buy house using cpf  u can use for 99 y,btohqsg
Alot of ppl taking up PHD/ Taxi driver course...,btohqsg
Honestly the coe going up is thanks to all those ph comapnies,btohqsg
Buy car using cpf  u can only use for 10 years,btohqsg
this wouldnt play well w the rich,btohqsg
Next year interest rate 9%Sure got many cars lelong salesHahaha,btohqsg
and tbh if i was a petrolhead i wouldnt mind paying more for more then 2 cars,btohqsg
Then after 10 years  use cpf to pay again?,btohqsg
and if i could afford it ofc hahaha,btohqsg
someppl their life my dream one,btohqsg
the only thing that is yours truly will the tombstone,btohqsg
But they don’t need to own a car right?,btohqsg
Some just leaking at home but got cars and wallet overload...,btohqsg
CPF purpose was for house 🏠To chase Kampung dweller into apartment,btohqsg
no but really i dont think govt should limit cars per household hahaha,btohqsg
They don't own but they will rent ma...,btohqsg
lets be honest if i had money id also want more than 2 cars hahaha,btohqsg
So if they drive back also no point ma...,btohqsg
so what we can have a house of 99 years? one word from government  u gotta leave and exchange for a smaller one and it's never yours again,btohqsg
wa bro  im not saying rich households shudnt have more than 1 car.. but dont u think 10 cars is abit too much?,btohqsg
Thus push up prices with the on-demand basis,btohqsg
+ some households really quite big need more than one car,btohqsg
Purpose of hdb is to provide affordable housing for singapore,btohqsg
But look at the prices now,btohqsg
HAHAHHA 1 daily 1 weekend 1 track 1 project 1 hauler,btohqsg
I heard from 65 yo onwards...,btohqsg
These rich should get tax more for every additional coe.,btohqsg
This one is Heng + suay.Those buy 25yrs+ HDBMust cross fingers 😅,btohqsg
Phv coe should be same as taxi,btohqsg
10 cars? that person won't be staying in HDB,btohqsg
but it is not good for biz,btohqsg
Since the purpose is same as taxi,btohqsg
Buying one normal car can get you something better in other countries sia some more they can keep it,btohqsg
They could be staying in landed but not having their cars parked inside. 😏,btohqsg
It’s either good for us or good for gahmen,btohqsg
When u use a vehicle for business vs personal comsumption  the willingness to bid higher is there for business use,btohqsg
my hdb neighbour has a f430 bhahaha,btohqsg
I think for taxi is 7 years onky right,btohqsg
Phv cars shouldbe the same mah,btohqsg
but sometimes households even in hdb will have more then 2 cars one,btohqsg
My cp also got GTR35 nismo very...,btohqsg
Business opportunities cost is high but it passthrough and someone have to pay… thus inflation skyrocket with this backing,btohqsg
bro ur household how many car sia,btohqsg
Strathmore HDB got Lamborghini.Not Coe one hor😂👍,btohqsg
now onlt got 1   last time had more when had more people staying haha,btohqsg
why not though  if the family can afford it ok what,btohqsg
Coe is a good way of distributing wealth,btohqsg
3 cars can be all bread and butter ones hor,btohqsg
My hdb carpark got lambo  gtr,btohqsg
Then affordability vs fairness doesn’t equate liao,btohqsg
Same like stamp duties for house,btohqsg
who u talking abt here? hmmmm,btohqsg
i have one maybech parking at the mscp,btohqsg
To me if a hdb dweller only have one lambo  I don’t really care.,btohqsg
but wah when tey come home,btohqsg
Anyway  stay hdb not necessary equate to average singaporeans,btohqsg
i have one maser gt neighbour  i appreciate the car  but when he come back at 3am and floor,btohqsg
Last time my house cp was jdm cars... now all update to conti cars...,btohqsg
u see those multigenerational households in hdb  all normal to own more then 1 car alr,btohqsg
KEEP GOING UP AND UP DK WANT PARK WHERE,btohqsg
one coc floor only whole estate can hear,btohqsg
But loud when going up mscp especially the slope...,btohqsg
Many people do business and has windfall 💸💰Especially covid19Selling mask  hand sanitizer  cleaning company.Media company.,btohqsg
Win $$$ until eyes see what the mind thinks Liao 😉😉😉,btohqsg
Last time got one black 2 door gti and wah... freaking loud until I stayed 11th floor with windows all closed still can hear the roar... wah piang... my vezel using hks also not that loud...,btohqsg
Then coe for their 2nd car and 3rd car should cost more.,btohqsg
but hks is literally called silent hi power,btohqsg
Take cash then go zhng car or holiday! Woohooooo!!!,btohqsg
or use it to service the loan la,btohqsg
fingers crossed life is good can stay hdb own 3 car next time,btohqsg
Why will I think of lan… I’m not gay,btohqsg
Ya... before owner got did midpipe and freaking loud... so ended up I changed the midpipe...,btohqsg
NEVER. WHY BORROWS MONEY TO SERVICE LOAN !?,btohqsg
Business abuse the quota used in hdb carparks?,btohqsg
I think you upset with someone today,btohqsg
cos got balance after deducting the necessary?,btohqsg
QUESTION IS: shouldn’t the loan be less then?!,btohqsg
ultimate respect for people who prioritise car over housing HAHAHA,btohqsg
Loan is not like Hello Kitty soft toy one. Not the more the merrier,btohqsg
if i know  i would be operating one already,btohqsg
Report them lo.Sometime pipe approved by emissions level too high also cannot pass LTA inspection.,btohqsg
Hahas... I now only focus upgrading my unit only... Roof is more important than car...,btohqsg
Is there any like any ideal age to own your first car,btohqsg
Yup... HKS 85db to approve... mine was 91db caused by the midpipe... and now changed used midpipe back to 85db...,btohqsg
Just need to see how much time one spends at which to determine which to spend more money on,btohqsg
Then how old are you now sir?,btohqsg
That is a common starting word of spammers,btohqsg
At that age where i wanna buy but i cant welp,btohqsg
Ya... that's why after my bto for 2 years then bought the Nissan note... now stayed 5 years with current vezel so its time to upgrade my roof to bigger roof...,btohqsg
10k can get you some cars,btohqsg
So do families with disabled members get priority to get cars?,btohqsg
excuse me sir  1k can down a chevrolet,btohqsg
Their parking space is guaranteed in many scenarios,btohqsg

Cause i see garage r all they ever post is the legal muffler,btohqsg
bro.. where got ppl post illegal mods one,btohqsg
How do i defermine if an exhaust system is legal or illegal in sg,btohqsg
They sell customers legal exhaust with cert,btohqsg
So is it like i change the exhaust at a workshop they will provide some cert and then i need to bring my car down to the inspection center get it certified ?,btohqsg
Whatever customers do afterwards  garage r can’t do anything,btohqsg
Bro  just know  if u wanna change exhaust or what mods that require LTA approval  need cert. No Cert  u go inspection u HG alr.,btohqsg
I am sam confused sia like how they determine legal,btohqsg
Get what’s already certified LTA friendly,btohqsg
So is go workshop to change they will provide cert ah,btohqsg
lta likes bastuck and akra for conti,btohqsg
Then i need go inspection get verified  myself?,btohqsg
Or try your luck buying exhaust yourself then go lta try get cert,btohqsg
thats all u need to know if u dont know so much abt mods yet,btohqsg
To get lta verification   is it just bring the exhaust down or fitted onto the car alr then bring there,btohqsg
oh ya sgcm ads be like,btohqsg
go f***k** tell the uncle “ 3 inch straight pipe  the rest 丢掉 ”,btohqsg
Erm thats not legal is it,btohqsg

Wait can someone explain how the verification works for exhaust .Is it i go workshop change exhaust setup they will give me the certification then i need go lta get it inspected ?,btohqsg
they do coil and installation also,btohqsg
no  usually workshops bring in exhausts that are alr certified for by LTA,btohqsg
So those legal ones dont need do anything at all la after do at workshop,btohqsg
thats why lta give the cert in adv,btohqsg
Wah what exhaust even legal in sg sia,btohqsg
