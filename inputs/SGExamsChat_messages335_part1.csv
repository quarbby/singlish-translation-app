"Abit long coz is a few incidents that happened to me:I would say bullying for me only happened when I was p4  which is very lucky considering how much shit most other students had to go through. Back then I had to change seats coz my previous seat partner kept stealing my shit. Then this new group I was sitting with was led by this girl who was very nice and friendly to me at first. Even started gaming coz she and her friends all playing: she was on friendly terms with almost everyone in the class.Later on she became very problematic. Our clique eventually had 4 people in total including me  all girls  with the girl mentioned before as the ""leader of the pack"". One of the other girls in the clique was my friend since p3. Mostly I was made fun of coz I was seen as nerdy  goody-two-shoes especially coz I played the piano  do my homework  listen to teacher. Basically I was ""uncool"".The most jialat case was when the leader decided to physically bully me  but the toxic thing was she knew she cannot do it herself in case she got into trouble  so she asked the other 2 girls to do it. I was dumb af also lah I stand there let them kick me coz I want to act tough  should have shoved her stupid face in the wall-- anyway  she kept taunting me to call my older bro to find them for revenge. My p3 friend later apologised to me  frankly she only kicked my shoe and didn't dare defy the leader for fear of being the next target. Very common trope in usual school group bullying casesThe toughest part was when my parents didn't pay much heed. My domestic helper actually questioned me on the bruise on my knee coz she said it looks like it was inflicted on purpose  but I kept insisting I fell down. She told my mum about her suspicions but my mum just briefly asked me what happened  and she believed immediately that I fell down. My family do know that this clique was a problematic bunch but I had no other friends irl so I had to stick around them  don't learn from me keedz just fk care this kind of peopleLater on this leader kept asking us to forge parents letter to pon school  to which I refused coz that meant forging signature as well which is serious shit. From there I got ostracised very very badly  but looking back  the leader was being stupid lah.Subsequently we were split into different classes in p5  this leader kept saying we must be friends foreva!!! And she decided to find me one day  tickle me while I was eating till I puked my food out. I must have looked fking murderous or some shit coz I never seen her running away so fast before. And yea  she avoided me and targeted another girl instead from then.",btohqsg
bruh i throw the paper alr lol,btohqsg
I missed my tuition loan application deadline,btohqsg
did anyone dsa to sajc yet,btohqsg
hello everyonedo yall know if money changers are common in korea  more specifically in seoul?,btohqsg
random qn  but yeah definitely  like any other major city you can find a few  though I would advise changing in Singapore first or using a multi-currency card (then withdrawing from ATMs as needed) to make things easier for you,btohqsg
I heard Jr and Sr papers were good,btohqsg
so im about to send in my report cards+cca records for dsa,btohqsg
but like my teacher printed my leadership position wrongly on my report bookðŸ˜¬ do i still send it in but add a note to contact my teacher for the updated leadership position or i dont send it in?,btohqsg
to go jc   do I have to include chinese in my l1r5,btohqsg
But u have to pass chinese,btohqsg
if never pass  totally cannot go jc ah,btohqsg
then can I take clb in JC even if I pass,btohqsg
i think thats on a case by case basis,btohqsg
I got f9 for chinese (not that Iâ€™m proud of it) and Iâ€™m taking CLB now,btohqsg
Yup clb is way less stressful,btohqsg
so D7 they'll recommend clb   E8 or worse   cannot go jc,btohqsg
is it possible I pass chinese but iw to take clb,btohqsg
Youâ€™ll need to negotiate with your school for that,btohqsg
then if my block test results also show that my chi jialat keep failing then is there a chance to drop to clb ?,btohqsg
oh okay  so taking clb is rly dependent on my olvl results otherwise nego with the sch,btohqsg
Yup they will just get you to take CLB if you get D7 or worse,btohqsg
haha that's great then  thx a lot,btohqsg
