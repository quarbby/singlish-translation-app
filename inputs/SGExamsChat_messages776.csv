Ya sia kuro ..... I thought you ought to know btr..,btohqsg
Eh u can come tm already,btohqsg
lol i just copy pasta from sch website,btohqsg
But i forgot the tone alreadyâ€¦,btohqsg
Hello Gude how is your day?,btohqsg
@aforacethis is better like ndp song sia,btohqsg
Yes i love the meridian song,btohqsg
Meridianâ€™s chapter ended when it was younger than me,btohqsg
I got it from the musician,btohqsg
We got treated to the teacherâ€™s performance (like the grp of chers who created the lyrics),btohqsg
Fml this actually make me miss jc more sia,btohqsg
Ngl I am weirdly attracted to that Good Bye at the end bruh,btohqsg
ngl I heard for sec schs merge  some sch still allow the immediate batches affected to wear their prior sec sch uni,btohqsg
like idk lor LOL exposed to another ppl from another sch,btohqsg
they had the holiday to change things  and yes it was q abrupt coz the new ur die die needa change alr  but we did bring down the meridian flag  like got a ceremony for it,btohqsg
In j1 orien  we had 1d of the orientation in tpjc,btohqsg
Erm like the 4 jcs that gonna move over to the other of the pair did not take j1 intake in 2018,btohqsg
Assimilate vs Integration write an essay that expounds the benefits and drawbacks of both and which do you in your opinion prefer?,btohqsg
So in 2018 they only had j2 batch,btohqsg
Ya but in 2018 the JC in the campus that the merged JC will not be located in stopped accepting students. Like tpjc did not accept any students in 2018 but mjc did since tmjc is at the former mjc campus,btohqsg
Oops only saw this after scrolling down,btohqsg
Ngl should have done a sociological study on the merger. Was it integration or assimilation,btohqsg
Don't think MOE will say yes to that but still,btohqsg
Ok not saying things actually happened the way it supposed to beâ€¦but the sch culture needa changed,btohqsg
But whether it actually happened is a different story,btohqsg
imo i think those top schools dont necessarily make every1 into a top student  to go there you already have to be a top student,btohqsg
I feel like a bit from both Jcs would be carried over but thereâ€™s probably some entirely new stuff,btohqsg
It is not like for instance tp culture totally disappeared (actually if anything the other way coz for some strange reason majority of sch leaders / tutors were fr tpjc),btohqsg
I could only find a US thesis on it,btohqsg
Like tpjc offered TSD while mjc did not  and since tmjc was at the former mjc campus  some room had to be renovated so that thereâ€™s the appropriate facilities for TSD,btohqsg
Actually REALâ€¦like it is a start of a new beginning,btohqsg
Oh I think maybe it was something else? Thought I heard something along the lines of that,btohqsg
Yeah the study is for the extent to which it was carried over and how dominant was one over the other.,btohqsg
I dun recall any new subjects being offered fr 2019 onwards tho,btohqsg
bro uses his brain more than 80% of people on the redditi am proud of you,btohqsg
Sounds interesting ngl I go and check if got NIE FYP URECA on that topic,btohqsg
I had no idea tp culture to comment on this,btohqsg
Correct me if Iâ€™m wrong but if itâ€™s assimilation whatâ€™s the difference? The culture of one Jc is much more dominant?,btohqsg
But clearly there was a significant change,btohqsg
But i mean as mentioned before ultimately the 4 mergers did get principal fr the other jc,btohqsg
If it's assimilation broadly u will still see 1 culture and it remains broadly unchanged,btohqsg
1 culture from either one of the JCs?,btohqsg
no because if you're the kind to complain about everything and have 0 self discipline you go ri/hwach also no use,btohqsg
Tbh not to blame the sch leaders if this happened in any of the 4 schs coz i see their position la but tbh as a student it kinda ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Since the principal of the merged JC is from the JC whose campus was not used for the merged sch  I feel like it would be more likely for the culture of the JC where principal came from to be preserved,btohqsg
But also I heard that tpjc principal wasnâ€™t as good as mjc?,btohqsg
Like yall were complaining about Pamela,btohqsg
Hmmm i wondered who u heard from,btohqsg
The principal is not the arbitrator of culture tho I mean?,btohqsg
But they get to decide like what each sch does,btohqsg
Like what practices to carry over,btohqsg
On a daily policy level yes,btohqsg
But the way in which teachers enforce the rules will differ,btohqsg
ye  tho im dubious abt many of the comments say that its like 1-1 lecturer to student ratio or 1-4 at best,btohqsg
I mean they take a mix of teachers from both when merge rite?,btohqsg
What 1-1 lecturer to student ratio,btohqsg
That means that every student has their own tutor,btohqsg
U can also argue that merged students adapt differently to the new architecture and place of the new school,btohqsg
A more geographical determinist view in some sense.,btohqsg
i thought you talking about jc having 1-1 student teacher ratio,btohqsg
i think its not impossible in camb,btohqsg
The ratio itself isn't a determination more on what it entails tbh,btohqsg
If it's STEM even with higher ratio they all probably end up doing research u suck thumb also,btohqsg
ngl i kinda want to go camb but my parents def cant afford,btohqsg
and i think i dont really have a chance to for undergrad but i wanna go camb for grad studies,btohqsg
need worry abt Os first for me pein,btohqsg
idk i tbh also dont really want nus that much cause of the common core mods,btohqsg
but then idk where else i can go,btohqsg
i guess ill just focus on alvls lor,btohqsg
yimingso like for example your major in nus chs is biology but then you have to take mods (classes) that take up 1/3 of your curriculumaka you went uni to study biology but have to take subjects like design thinking and asian studies that you didnt sign up for,btohqsg
and the thing is its graded,btohqsg
so imagine ur PE  Art  music etc is all graded in O levels even though u didnt CHOOSE to take them,btohqsg
they even affect if u are able to get ur degree?,btohqsg
But u can SU for NUS,btohqsg
but to compete with students ard the world scary,btohqsg
polys are like this too I think,btohqsg
Theres a bunch of compulsory useless mods,btohqsg
every uni has the equivalent of these things,btohqsg
in some way shape or form,btohqsg
I have rose from the dead hahaha,btohqsg
i....havent finish my ph2101 mind map,btohqsg
i did not start on my mh2801 mindmap,btohqsg
do mind maps actually work for you,btohqsg
and i took mc for my ps0002 midterms,btohqsg
but i still wait for reply from my prof,btohqsg
man is busy af cus of cc7,btohqsg
I NEED MY CC7 proofread so i need do lcc consult,btohqsg
i never used that before tbh,btohqsg
U actually went to the com cube,btohqsg
but i mean use the resources you have available,btohqsg
one for cc1  one for cc5,btohqsg
@kohsyani got A for bio and gp :pI mean I could've done better for bio but eh at least I got A,btohqsg
Tells u what to do for grammar etc,btohqsg
free assistance with written assignments etc,btohqsg
jiayous jiejie you can do it,btohqsg
This was exactly my feeling for chem prelims,btohqsg
Then my cher be like â€˜it is still an A right?â€™,btohqsg
So the feeling of getting A is foreign to him,btohqsg
Prof@kohsyan  can you explain to me why k=sqrt(2mE)/hand not k=sqrt(2m(E-V))/h?,btohqsg
My gp highest was D and it was j2 mbt,btohqsg
Also I do not like my actual prof so yes.,btohqsg
CoE half is Chinese and Indians,btohqsg
any1 else cant learn a topic well in class just listening,btohqsg
LOL you remind me my econs Cher  SAID he wanted to PUNISH me and decided to not gimme 1 mark to push my grade to an A I MEAN my ans was kinda messy but if u match the pts it's there,btohqsg
my physics cher rn very good at explaining but i feel like he spends too much time talking thru the notes i just lose attention lol,btohqsg
he wanted to punish me for not being tidy enofðŸ¥¹ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
ya that might also be an issue of his teaching method,btohqsg
i have issues with teachers who end up yapping,btohqsg
i just end up playing games in class,btohqsg
he yaps on topic but if im not doing anything with my hands i lose attention  yt shorts generation fr,btohqsg
with a constant potential  p sure you're just causing a constant energy shift but it shouldn't affect the k relation,btohqsg
like if you plug both into a schrodinger equation  you'd get the same form  just adjusted by the constant potential,btohqsg
Guys sorry if it's mean but I feel like maybe it's not the good idea to speculate too much about the accident rn,btohqsg
wasn't there even more speculation yesterday as compared to today,btohqsg
so in the sense  E-V is also correct?,btohqsg
cus i thot E is only if V=0,btohqsg
yes  it just kinda doesn't matter for the overall behaviour of the system,btohqsg
i keep thinking wyatt is the light bulb type of watt,btohqsg
this proves to say that i am a siao zhabor,btohqsg
idk ppl kept talking about it in the morning,btohqsg
idk  all ik is yest got 2 car accident,btohqsg
bro my science and math ended up scoring better than my english in the end for national exams,btohqsg
because it was just like C C B D,btohqsg
for math  science  chinese & english,btohqsg
or was it both morning at tampines,btohqsg
one evening not at Tampines i think,btohqsg
i actually forgot a lot of basic QM,btohqsg
i mainly rmb the stuff i use,btohqsg
2nd order de is okay...until f(x)=/=0,btohqsg
You guys know H2 FM remove conic sections but added multivariable calc?,btohqsg
which is good tbh bc multivariable is way more useful,btohqsg
Sadly for me i dont take h2 fm :(,btohqsg
they reintroduced fm after i finished jc,btohqsg
wait then is it true to also say w=E/h or E-V/h or is it correct for both of them?,btohqsg
oya u take h2 fmath rite,btohqsg
wtf theres someone specifically requesting for a male tutor above 30 years old who teaches h2 physics only,btohqsg
If he says yes  it is a troll,btohqsg
do uw do some fmath qns,btohqsg
Hold up there's a H2 fmath?,btohqsg
smeone ask me to do fmath qns for them,btohqsg
but idk how to do fmath,btohqsg
Ah so close yet so far,btohqsg
ok lemme rephrase. in the SE  E would include V typically so you're alr looking at the influence of the potential when looking at E  so the rs between k omega and E would include V too. that's why you just use E and not E-V. but if you wanna remove V's influence  then it's a separate thing.,btohqsg
The hougang one yea i saw,btohqsg
So even if V has non-zero potential  E is still E and not E-V?,btohqsg
yea like you're working in a situation where the particle constantly has the influence of V. it's going to affect things like omega  unless fsr you wanna work out what it'd be without V present,btohqsg
Theres a channel where ppl post tuition listing,btohqsg
Helpz i saw this on my ig feed,btohqsg
I actually wonder who mans it,btohqsg
always seem abit weird to me,btohqsg
feel like a money merry go round,btohqsg
ngl i feel like if you want effective tuition 1 to 1 is the way to go,btohqsg
i mean like your parents pay lets say 100$  then they give you 10$ in idk gifts.,btohqsg
personal experience: priv are as bad as centres,btohqsg
Moral of the story dont get tuition,btohqsg
then ur parents effectively gave u extra 10$,btohqsg
tuition is for a failed education system,btohqsg
Moral of the story just be smart,btohqsg
How do they even get the contents,btohqsg
i rly want get it for my phys and chem lol,btohqsg
but im lazy to change rn,btohqsg
i too poor for phd man,btohqsg
SELF PRAISE IS NO PRAISE LEH,btohqsg
Imagine being a long standing tuition center but having like a subpar distinction rate for subjects,btohqsg
the only advnatages of zenith1. U get to go USS,btohqsg
whether thats an advantage is uty,btohqsg
i go mavis for my tuition tho,btohqsg
someone asked me which tuition i go to,btohqsg
i said i dont go for tuition,btohqsg
but recently felt like theyve been more like uptight abt how they share the resources,btohqsg
I see this wah my eyes feel v shiok sia,btohqsg
uni shit like dropping more hair and degrading my mental health,btohqsg
used to be able to get the pdf of the resources on the login,btohqsg
used to be able to watch recording like even 6 months after,btohqsg
Going to tuition is a SKILL ISSUE,btohqsg
just change to 24-48 hrs after,btohqsg
Did u had finals or smth,btohqsg
ik lah i not built diffðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Imagine going for tuition and scoring the same as someone who spends 2h/day on telegram,btohqsg
I hv 4 spread over 1w,btohqsg
It keep appearing on my ig suggested,btohqsg
Mine is on 1 2 6 1,btohqsg
It is a road of death,btohqsg
what course are u in anw why your finals so cui aso,btohqsg
Iâ€™m in pharm but Iâ€™m taking 1 electives (which is on Monday)  the other ones are core exams,btohqsg
Imagine going for tuition at Zenith and scoring WORSE than someone who didnt even study,btohqsg
Actually for some reason Iâ€™m suspecting my exam set number shown is wrong,btohqsg
I've been stress eating so much it's unhealthy LOL,btohqsg
My friend apparnatly is trying to like drop a student,btohqsg
My exam seat in the venue B is like greater number than the one in venue A lol,btohqsg
so hes trying to do it by upping the prices for her,btohqsg
It does not make any sense to me,btohqsg
but then its literally impossible to do it in a way thats sustainable because the competition is with zenith,btohqsg
like how do u reasonably justify charging more than $600/month,btohqsg
Idk if it is me overthinking or should I even bother checking  I dun want idk go there to find out and then blur blur,btohqsg
is it more than raymond math and sci one? i rmb that 1 dam ex,btohqsg
Ok I will blur blur go there,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA I do not assume any responsibility for any negative effects this might have,btohqsg
Help I read this as lena,btohqsg
But anyw i dont see the point in paying for tuition,btohqsg
Tbh I also dunno who I should ask,btohqsg
nus dh an exam team to disturb meh,btohqsg
The only subj i rly need help w is chem and then@chemcercan be the FREE LABOUR,btohqsg
Hmmm it was mentioned here multiple times,btohqsg
i didnt study for gp and all but still got A then ppl who actl study didnt get A,btohqsg
thats like almost 100+ more for mine,btohqsg
ok imma go back to killing myself over random meaningless numbers on a piece of paper,btohqsg
GP is a common sense suject,btohqsg
apparantly the most common tuition in RI is GP,btohqsg
400 dollar can be used to buy 40 discord nitros for my 40 discord alt accounts,btohqsg
like people go for 3 GP tuitions,btohqsg
my friend was telling me that its super common to see students have 2-3 GP tuitions,btohqsg
Makers club also got q a few quote,btohqsg
I felt like gp you study so much also know use if you cant write for shit so might as well use the time to study bio,btohqsg
"""How bad can ur english be to go for 2-3 GP tuitions AND still get a B""",btohqsg
if you go for 3 gp tuitions you've missed the entire point of gp which is to use your brain,btohqsg
tbf hes from a few batches ago? I think hes 2018 grad,btohqsg
Eh thank god I not in tm now coz my gp tutor will be my cca tutor,btohqsg
Because the marker xi huan ni,btohqsg
no hes from the 2016 graduating batch,btohqsg
Then his Phys Cher announce to the cca,btohqsg
See in class still needs see in cca,btohqsg
ur gp cher miss u lah,btohqsg
IF U NEED TO CHIONG [urgent cca proj] I GIVE U PERMISSION TO NOT DO TUTORIAL,btohqsg
He is the last person I misses,btohqsg
Did I mention that 1/2 tutors,btohqsg
Helps thank god Iâ€™m not placed in the situation,btohqsg
Nah he's well liked by them both,btohqsg
Tbh my cts made it obvious la that they dun like us,btohqsg
all u remembered is ur guzheng,btohqsg
But ngl i plan to be f2p for the entire jc,btohqsg
The grad book every class rote 1 page my ct rote 4 lines,btohqsg
Because my ego is too inflated,btohqsg
i was f2p and got 8 distinctions,btohqsg
Then the result slip across all 3 exams  it is the same 1 liner,btohqsg
I had priv tuition in y3 but i kinda stopped cause cant be bothered,btohqsg
Pls gimme good luck for tmr,btohqsg
P2w is Pay to win aka many tuitions,btohqsg
Please give me luck for next week,btohqsg
U need TM notes for what again,btohqsg
i forced my cher to give it,btohqsg
Yes basically I love how they made that apparent,btohqsg
Anyway judge me if uw but the moment i hear someone goes to zenith for tuition my opinion of them instantly decreases,btohqsg
isnt it just a geog essay,btohqsg
ur possible range of scores is,btohqsg
Then idk how much actually in my brain info now,btohqsg
u have a 1/13 chance of getting full marks,btohqsg
wait then the qn would literally just be,btohqsg
"""Evaluate the success of strategies to manage climate change""",btohqsg
Is Mr gohell still the dm,btohqsg
I did btr for bio now than in y4 cause i have a comparatively better mental state,btohqsg
"""Mitigation>Adaptation."" Evaluate the validity of this statement",btohqsg
In y4 my mental health was ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
There's also some international cooperation is the solution to cc,btohqsg
I got jebaited by the qn when I analyse sia,btohqsg
are they testing the very first box only,btohqsg
yeah its technically not in syllabus,btohqsg
I hope u remain this way,btohqsg
they can only ask you to compare generally,btohqsg
I hope Lena don't sohai sia,btohqsg
90% of the geog cohort just had chem ta tdy,btohqsg
Cuz A Levels they said that the content to be tested will only come from the syllab doc. so the phrasing of every qn will follow syllab doc phrasing,btohqsg
what some schs test sometimes (RI),btohqsg
I remembered me praying that the chers me nice on the papers,btohqsg
Then she turn tdy lect to revision session,btohqsg
But it's kinda her nagging so I'm like,btohqsg
many things in the syllabus is grey,btohqsg
Actually tbh somehow what I felt about the paper is always different from reality,btohqsg
Always nag at the first post-results tutorial,btohqsg
Wait I just ask U ah,btohqsg
My chem Cher my ct but then she is not even with our class  she is at the other chem lecture,btohqsg
yes but many things are not explicitly stated,btohqsg
Isit in gen they can't test specific strat,btohqsg
I follow the syllabus for near to 20 yrs leh,btohqsg
Actly shit like waste mgmt they prolly can ask for specific strat right,btohqsg
ok I dunno geogbut somewhere in each syllabus should have something similar,btohqsg
IW to burn the world fr,btohqsg
last paragraph is where they protect themselves,btohqsg
they dh that para in the geog sylla doc,btohqsg
In gen they can'tThey will use the phrasing from the syllabus document,btohqsg
they wont test u about landfills,btohqsg
evaluate the usefulness of landfills in managing waste,btohqsg
So let's say challenge of implementing statsThey can ask economic challenges is the largest challenge,btohqsg
that was the specimen paper qn,btohqsg
cuz landfills is not explicitly in the syllabus doc,btohqsg
i heard for hist also similarcause specific case studies arent in the syllabus i think each sch teaches diff case studies,btohqsg
"""Varying success of strategies to manage non-hazardous solid wasteacross places """,btohqsg
Bartholomew- what.. wa such an alas name siol,btohqsg
shud be also the case? But hist q fixed i think no meh,btohqsg
i mean its history so its 1 set of events but i heard that it does differ from sch to sch how they teach,btohqsg
cuz they very clearly outline what are the cases u need to know,btohqsg
i heard some schs got teach extra,btohqsg
because some stuff outside of syllabus alr,btohqsg
but cambridge highly likely 99.9999% wont,btohqsg
3-4 diff strategies or wtv fuck,btohqsg
what do yall learn for waste,btohqsg
i memo the stuff i like,btohqsg
then the stuff idl i just wtv,btohqsg
They might fuck with ppl... see Korean War and Olevel history,btohqsg
like the stupid debt for nature thingy,btohqsg
Isnt korean war in o level history (idk i never take history),btohqsg
Feel like maybe there's more but I forgot,btohqsg
Yes but didn't come out for like 9 years,btohqsg
I rmb circular flow or smth,btohqsg
Last year of syllabus they decided to fuck with ppl,btohqsg
because not all schs will test it,btohqsg
But this one I think is specified in doc,btohqsg
So it's fine if TM didn't teach that we aren't fucked for As ah,btohqsg
its a very important concept to learn,btohqsg
Good fucking bye I'm gonna be bbqed during june,btohqsg
yes i call it CUM cuz circular urban metabolism is too long of a sentence to type,btohqsg
Wah finally this bot slip thru,btohqsg
But honestly I just rmb as a side bar info,btohqsg
I feel it's nvr rly tested,btohqsg
its a very central concept in waste management actually,btohqsg
The whole idea of urban sustainability and balance revolves around CUM,btohqsg
@IcedMilogive this bot a medal for getting thru,btohqsg
But I rmb she spent more time yapping abt circular,btohqsg
"""Demand placed on natural environments when waste is not viewed as a potential resource""",btohqsg
Linear is the reason why got alot of waste what,btohqsg
Out of context this is errr very interesting,btohqsg
idk if they tell u this,btohqsg
Ok nvm focus on cc first,btohqsg
but in ej they keep telling us,btohqsg
sustainable urban development is the imbalance between the needs of poeple and the potential of a city,btohqsg
or some fk shit like that,btohqsg
Pls tell me that's a mnemonic,btohqsg
When I went to uni I learnt about sponge cities,btohqsg
they taught us that for flooding,btohqsg
its cause its not explicitly required by the geog syllabus,btohqsg
i never bothered to properly learn abt it,btohqsg
cuz it was so inconsequential in the context of flooding,btohqsg
and also cause i just hated writing essays abt flooding,btohqsg
Sometimes it's about efficient space utilisation,btohqsg
Flooding actually is a rare thing and technically just make sure your pipped supply is still present can liao,btohqsg
Tldr both shld coexist tgtAdaptation for short termMitigation long term,btohqsg
okay so normally the way I always write,btohqsg
It's infrastructure + geography which is more fun imo,btohqsg
BP1: Mitigation > Adaptation (Because global strategy it allows like codependence  can help to negate localised conditions)Talk abt Kyoto/COPs/REDD+BP2: Mitigation > Adaptation because mitigation directly deals with the root causes of climate change but adaptation deals more indirectlyTalk abt Carbon Capture/ReforestationBP3: Adaptation is still needed as a short-term response to the immediate effects experienced by countries,btohqsg
Like these are normally my points?,btohqsg
I have my essay for it if uw,btohqsg
1 plate of chicken rice plus egg,btohqsg
Not for actual As tho ofc,btohqsg
u physically cannot get C for geog,btohqsg
