May i know if online spending is qualify for the $350 cashback?,btohqsg
I spend on fairprice app  qoo10 and shopee. They told me that i am not qualify. üòÇ Can anyone advice on that? üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
I call in to check then i know i am not even qualify for the cashback. üò±,btohqsg
Someone said this has been fixed,btohqsg
CS means cold storage? but this is fairprice.  fixed meaning now can pay via fairprice app and consider as online transaction?,btohqsg
I registered for uob 100k earmarked promo  but don‚Äôt see my earmarked yet  do I need to worry?,btohqsg
Is there any visa or Mastercard that is somewhat like UOB TCB?,btohqsg
What do you mean with like or close?,btohqsg
Need to do manually + cannot use broker due to workplace,btohqsg
UOB absolute you mean? Amex true cashback  Citi cashback +  SCB simply cash is all around the same concept,btohqsg
When will ocbc tr 9x credit? Assume this is not related to statements  correct?,btohqsg
What is the uob ladies card point expiry?,btohqsg
If google ‚ÄúUOB lady expiry‚Äù  shall be easy to find the expiry.,btohqsg
It will be reflected in the monthly statement it won‚Äôt be too soon. The expiry is the same as the uni$ expiry from Other cards pooled into one,btohqsg
Thank you. Also can the citi rewards points and citi prestige point be combine together since it‚Äôs the same thank you point?,btohqsg
Never used Citi for the credit cards charging   only used it for the balance transfer programme,btohqsg
As in intention is to combine the points for miles redemption,btohqsg
No. Citi cards do not pool.  You need to pay separate miles conversion fee for different cards.,btohqsg
No particular reason- my first job was in UOB. Stuck with UOB and their miles cards are better than citi. I‚Äôm a mile chaser,btohqsg
Hi any recommendations for a credit card for any type of spending?,btohqsg
Citi has more transferring airline partners  eg. 9 and premiers miles has no expiry date.UOB only has 3 transferring airline partners. Miles usually expires in 2 years.,btohqsg
Lol sry I mean like general spending eg. Food  groceries  shipping,btohqsg
If u willing to manage different cards then many choices,btohqsg
Wat wld u recommend ? Tks,btohqsg
UOB airmiles card 1.4miles per dollar versus 1.2 for citi that‚Äôs why and don‚Äôt need to care about MCC. And uni$ used to Convert for SQ solely. Even so now with the combined power (with spouse) of the uob lady‚Äôs card it‚Äôs 4 categories  easier to cover most of our frequent spendings,btohqsg
Got a question on the Amaze card. Still new to using it.When I use the Amaze card  it shows the converted foreign currency in SGD inside the app. Eg spent 30 MYR = 8.72 SGD . Is there any other hidden fees (like the FX fee) charged later?,btohqsg
No hidden fee charged later. I used it for some time already,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGwhen is the best time to transfer cpf oa to sa? month end or?,btohqsg
Hi any recommendations for a credit card for any type of spending?,btohqsg
Yes it is  pair with ega even better,btohqsg
If you are still in contact with UOB  can help to suggest to UOB to enhance the apps for mile conversion. When user want to convert miles  users can enter their air miles membership number together with the miles conversion request? That will shorten the conversion time required.Currently  UOB requires user to submit airline membership number first  it take as long as 2 -3 weeks to update the membership number. Only after it is updated  then user can submit conversion request.Btw I have submitted my airline membership number 3 weeks ago  still no news as of today.,btohqsg
Can share how to submit the membership number?,btohqsg
Hi guys is it worth the hassle to invest OA into tbill?  Think if we use 100k  2.5% vs 3.88%(example)  the difference is abt $300?,btohqsg
Go to UOB Apps -> Rewards+ -> Redeem UNI$ -> Travel. Choose the airline you want to convert  Then click ‚Äúterm n condition‚Äù.,btohqsg
Found it  and thanks for the heads up for 2-3 weeks,btohqsg
Have anyone try this? Say 2 percent cap at 10k spend per month,btohqsg
By diner  say can get signup gift if get 2 card,btohqsg
I mean for big spender it is 2 percent cap at 10k spend per month  not a bad deal,btohqsg
Mine is still no news or they will secretly update on backend without informing me? Nobody know. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èMy suggestion to you is submit both Kris and Asia miles membership number now even if you don‚Äôt need it at the moment.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm just starting Uob miles with lady solitaire  but thanks for the info,btohqsg
Why sia. What‚Äôs the number to call?,btohqsg
I just check I applied yuu in apr. Now jul. Izit still haven‚Äôt payout?,btohqsg
Just call in and check bro. They able to advice you. Maybe you not even qualify and you not aware?,btohqsg
Pls stated your spending habit  monthly spend  spend on what etc before any one can advice. There is ton of card out there. Plus are u a cashback or miles person,btohqsg
Can anyone share with me regards to the minimum spending.,btohqsg
Payment to fairprice by app  shopee and qoo10 are not qualify.,btohqsg
Many tks! Food  public transport  groceries  toiletries,btohqsg
Cashback more ... miles I dunno hw to utilize,btohqsg
If monthly 2-3 k for cashback can consider hsbc advance if u want simple if u want more then need to spilt spending into more card,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs just put it this way  the bank is big with many departments. They won‚Äôt entertain request like that even if it‚Äôs from an internal staff. Maybe I should learn more in@ChrisHMSGand folks‚Äô journey then be qualified to manage the credit cards rewards team and ease off the pain we all feelWith all the banks‚Äô reward systems . These policy maker folks are totally disconnected with the ground,btohqsg
