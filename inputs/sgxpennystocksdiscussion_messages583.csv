📮Ask Pika Nat Series #7🔭Chinese stocks had a world of fun  see-sawing as investors navigated their way out of the often negative news from the domestic and international spheres. As a result  we have received numerous questions on our perspective of Chinese stocks; hence  the write up of this edition.Let's get into the details.🦁Aloha  I am Alive!🦕It was a loud calling as Chinese stocks started the week trending higher  with Alibaba leading the game after the announcement on the reshuffled of key management. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) also announced tiny drips of stimulus to help protect the downside to economic expansions.Essentially  the policy stimulus aims to reduce reserves held by banks to help lower financing rates for companies that are struggling. In addition  it could be seen as a move by the Chinese government in managing the potential fallout of China's Evergrande. Indeed  the patient needs the pill.⌛️Risks remains intact💡Two key risks continue to loom in the market  other than Covid-19  include the delisting voices by the US and China's ability to swim out of the Evergrande's debt problem.💵#1: Evergrande Debt Woes💰In its latest filing last Friday  it hints at the need to restructure its massive debt. The company faces a whopping $82.5 million payment due to offshore creditors. However  the policy stimulus by the Chinese government on Monday may help soften the blow of possible fallout as it would release around $188 billion liquidity into the financial system.Most striking is the company's acknowledgement that it had received demands of payment obligation of about $260 million and that there is no guarantee they will be able to payout this debt. While the government in Guangdong province had sent a risk management team to ensure the company's operationn sustainability  more is to be seen if there are direct handouts. The Chinese authorities hinted to the founder to use part of his wealth to shoulder the company's debt.Perhaps the best scenario would be an orderly restructuring in the company. Yet  the most pressing issue is the inability of the organization to shed away its assets at a pace that comforts the nerves of investors. If there is any indication  it could be more pain down the road.🕹#2: Delisting by Didi Global (DIDI)🧯This would be the focus area as investors wonder how the process would begin. It would be logical to see more fund managers shifting their exposure to Chinese markets by purchasing Hong Kong-listed shares.The cloudy outlook on how delisting would turn out means an overhang on Chinese stocks. As Pika World highlights  the economic playout in China has often been a political-economy state. When politics intertwine with the engines of private enterprises  one could be domestic  and another function is external such as the diplomatic boycott of the winter Olympics in China by the US.The simmering background tension has deterred investors from going full in with confidence into China  often seen as an attractive market of expansionary growth and capital gain.💎Our Take on the Grand Scheme💎Remaining invested in Chinese stocks is our stance. Nonetheless  even as China's macro environment has turned for the better with more policy stimulus  it is wise to maintain a vigilant outlook for more certainty and clarity  especially on the blueprint of delisting. And for retail investors  this might be a challenging route.Yet  as investors  we have the longevity of time and the hindsight of past episodes  which hopefully will be our worldly-wise torch towards the road ahead.Thank you for spending precious time reading this edition  and we will see you in the next one.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

Interesting on the 7th of Oct 2021  there was a big married deal at $0.016  approx 30 000 000 shares.Hence  I reckon $0.015/$0.016 almost risk free price to enter (for holders)Contra  also possible since the Controlling shareholder just did an off market deal at $0.025 yesterday. Considering that market is looking to bounce from the recent sell down  this one might just run since he is willing to buy at a big premium.Interesting times for Sitra I would say.They might just do a HGH/ Tritech.I hope this one will help to avenge my recent losses.DYODD,btohqsg

"🚀Pika World Daily Update: 8 December 2021🚀Equity markets rose sharply as Omicron appears to be milder than most other variants  allying to the concerns that it might derail the economic recovery. Major indices cheer on the latest update  especially when more medications appear to be effective against the variant.🎙We have a Deal🕰The government is finally functioning again. Both Republicans and Democrats have come together on a deal to raise the US borrowing limit to avert a potential default on its loan.It comes after weeks-long intensive negotiation as Senate Republicans are unwilling to help Democrats due to opposition to President Biden's trillion-dollar social spending. Democrats will need 60 votes to pass the debt ceiling legislation based on the Senate filibuster rules. Nonetheless  Democrats in the House had introduced a measure that would require them to have a simple majority. Democrats will still need 10 votes from Republicans.The result is to raise the debt ceiling to a certain level such that it will not lead to automatic Medicare cuts. It will remove an overhang on our December political calendar if this clears.🚔Intel: Mobileye  the Cash Cow💵It has been a while since Pika World talked about Intel latest venture. And it turns out a piece of good news is brewing. First  shares of Intel had a good run as it is ""eying"" to take its Mobileye venture public.The UPO is planned to take place around the middle of 2022  and it could value the unit at more than $50 billion. Intel will still retain as the largest shareholder of the unit. The venture is in the business of supplying advanced automotive safety systems  which Intel had bought in 2017. So what they do is to create cameras on cars that allow adaptive cruise drive mode and lane-keep assistance  which are two essential elements for vehicles to drive by themselves.Pika World maintains a favourable outlook on the company as it further develops new capabilities for the group.The market has been a good ride for the past 2 days  and we hope you enjoy this good read.Pika World wishes everyone a moonatic week ahead!Cheers Pika Nat.",btohqsg

A lot of people have been quitting,btohqsg
I suspect so... Approximately 78.3% of the purchase consideration or $131.5 million will be funded by the issuance of approximately 431 million new First REIT units at a 9.3% premium to First REIT’s three-month volume weighted average price of 27.9 cents.,btohqsg

Depends on your time horizon bah,btohqsg
New units -> dilution -> immediate dividend also impacted,btohqsg
Income from acquisition...also takes time to generate,btohqsg
Upon reading more... OUELH said the total consideration comprises S$131.5 million in new First Reit units  issued at S$0.305 per unit  S$15.8 million in cash and S$16.2 million in intercompany balances  which will be assumed by First Reit.,btohqsg
This means the new shares are given to OUELH in exchange for the assets?,btohqsg
Haha they may have an incentive to push to 0.305. but that's speculation,btohqsg
Upon completion of the proposed transaction  the group's holdings in First Reit will increase to 33.2 per cent from 15.3 per cent.,btohqsg
Last time dividend 1 dollar for 100 share holder.. everyone get 1 cent,btohqsg
what do u mean by whacking?,btohqsg
But more income... More to share too... But nett nett more or less... Not so sure,btohqsg
not asking more money from unitholders. no rights issue coming up as far as i can see,btohqsg
But not recommended to buy now... I thought I saw a good opportunity... Guess the market is faster than me,btohqsg

💎Pika World On the Go💎🏋️Omicron: GO GO GO⏱Here comes a piece of good news. The variant appears to be able to bypass protection with two doses of Pfizer. However  a study had also shown that those infected and received two doses were able to neutralise the variant  a hint that booster doses can perhaps help alleviate the risk of infection. Re-infection has been a critical concern for health authorities worldwide.The ongoing positive news on vaccines helps reduce the fear that vaccines in their current form offer no protection. However  Pika World generally believes that market participants are more focused on the Fed's action in next week's FOMC meeting.⛳️Volkswagen: Porsche IPO on the Card🎙The luxury car company is considering listing its brand car  Porsche  as part of its initiative to fund its electric vehicle ambition. It is expected to fetch about 45 billion to 90 billion euros in valuation.As part of the deal  the Piech and Porsche families who own a significant share of Volkswagen would sell a portion of their stake to help fund a direct share of the luxury car brand. This would raise around 15 billion euros. Ultimately  the family will still maintain as the major shareholder.Intending to become the world leader in electric vehicles  the move reflects the struggle and determination of CEO Herbert in revamping the legacy car brand as it tries to snug off the woes of supply chain issues and the trouble in the Chinese market.🚗ChargePoint: Not Charging Yet🚚The company's latest earnings report is somewhat mixed. The third-quarter loss was more comprehensive than expected  at $69.4 million. Nonetheless  revenue had registered a strong growth of 79% to hit $65 billion  which is at the upper end of the company's guidance.Adjusted gross margin is healthy as it rose to 27% compared to 20% a year ago. It now expects full fiscal year revenue to be around $235 million to $240 million  slightly higher than its previous guidance.Pika World remains vested in the counter given the US infrastructure bill favouring green energy and EV growth.We hope you enjoy this read. Pika World wishes you a profitable week ahead!Cheers Pika Nat,btohqsg
