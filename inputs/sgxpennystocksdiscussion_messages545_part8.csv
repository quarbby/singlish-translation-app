Those local institutions which loan out to those retailers  that's e big one,btohqsg
REX coming mouth 220 !! huat ah,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt they pay one round of domestic debt last month? I think they will continue to prioritise the local institutions at the expanse of retailers and foreign debtors..,btohqsg

Ceiling is meant to be push higher every few years. US will never achieve budget or bop surplus unless they willing to tighten the spending  which this will also affect the world economy,btohqsg
