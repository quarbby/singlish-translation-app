Guess that‚Äôs why the rich get richer‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Then you're probably outta luck. Not sure if there are decent credit cards with no income requirement,btohqsg
I‚Äôm trying to say there are things in life which simply favour the rich (or employed and drawing salary),btohqsg
Well you just assume too much my friend. Chris knows me abit better. The reason I'm not drawing a salary is because of tax reasons and I will leave it at that,btohqsg
Got a lot of debit cards that have cashback with minimum spend. Not as good as CCs but better than nothing,btohqsg
what do you mean? Cashback is a benefit,btohqsg
Min spend is a pain. I want something like Amex TCB no min spend,btohqsg
If your monthly min spend cannot even hit those amounts  then probably you don't really need a credit card anyway. The rewards aren't that great  especially if like you said you're saving on taxes..Amex TCB is 1.5% cashback only  if you cannot hit 500 or 600 a month your max cashback a month only around $5-10Just weigh your cost and benefit  i'm sure saving on income tax is definitely better than any reward you can get haha,btohqsg
