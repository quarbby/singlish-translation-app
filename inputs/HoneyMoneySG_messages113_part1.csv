For grocery  my Crmc almost hit 1k  whatâ€™s should the replacement card  if I use uob ppv and pay with FP app  will get 4mpd?,btohqsg
UOB evol increasing min spend to $800 for statement generated after 7 aug 24 :(,btohqsg
Please note that UOB EVOL card spending will be increased to $800 from Aug 2024.Refer to website for more information :https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/cashback/evol-card/index.pageRevised cashback cap : S$30 online & mobile contactless  S$20 overseas spend (in-store only). Minimum spend $800 per monthEVOL nerf incoming,btohqsg
$30 online and $30 contactless ?,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t it 0.4mpd for revo if itâ€™s excluded from mcc,btohqsg
"Not ""and"" that way I thinkIt's $30 capped cashback for online + contactlessAs opposed to the original $40 cap",btohqsg
Actually 800 is also quite a lot,btohqsg
"""Realistic"" effective cashback rate is 3.7% from Aug onwards. Nobody should and would use a cashback card for consistent overseas spending",btohqsg
Minimum spending for cash back card to get desire cash back %.. is the reason why I switch to miles/ reward card. If I need to spend 800. I rather use citi rewards or hsbc revolution.,btohqsg
Same logic for me. I certainly value a mile at more than 1 cent. My plan now is to thrift it out with these two cards for 1 year  and see what new to bank offers UOB got come 2025,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing your future reading  please provide us with more of your predictions,btohqsg
Your card should suit you   not you go out of your way to spend lol,btohqsg
Can I ask your wise opinion what if miles cards drops to 1mpd? Will you still continue to use miles card,btohqsg
Haha right after singsaver miles vs cashback campaign. Like a slap on the face.,btohqsg
I am glad to be in this group. Admin and chris allow the members to share info on savings. Unlike aaron side everyday on miles and hotel programme... now I more into miles...Although hsbc has nerd travel... but can still use dbs woman world card to replace it.Only problem is rewards points expire 1 year and amaze is chopped.,btohqsg
It would be a sad state of affairs for all rewards chasers if that happened. But since it hasn't we should all still make hay while the sun shines,btohqsg
But you also everyday share about miles and hotel programme,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why evol was never on their recommended list for cashback cards,btohqsg
That will unlikely to happen.Esp for hsbc revolution and citi rewards. The reason why I think may bank switch to blocks of 5 is they want to follow the way spore bank does it.,btohqsg
Don't have to say other group. Just mind our own business will do.And it's nerf  not nerd,btohqsg
The question is your opinion on what if. What would you do?,btohqsg
If that happens .. then I will see the clips of chris. I am sure he will share what are the cards to use next...,btohqsg
My opinion Is I will read up other blog to find alternatives,btohqsg
I have a feeling. The day will come max card or revoult will allow cards to earn reward to compete against amaze.,btohqsg
Then thatâ€™s not your opinion  itâ€™s others opinion. What if all miles chasers move to cashback cards  will you cancel all your miles card and move to cashback?,btohqsg
I already say that is not going to be happen. Because of competition,btohqsg
Lads stop pressuring him with hypothetical situations that are unlikely to ever occur. Airlines and banks have partnered for way too long that they wouldn't allow them to screw up rewards programmes like that,btohqsg
You see why bro.. ocbc rewards.. they no longer have yearly big purchase benefits but they allow certain merchants to be use and customers able to gain 6 miles rewards.,btohqsg
What may happen is dbs woman may nerd the points to 1000 to 1100 monthly bonus cap to be on par with citi or hsbc,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not hypothetical if you look at the bigger picture. HSBC had like 2 nerfs/changes to their mcc whitelist in like less than a year. What makes you think other banks wonâ€™t follow suit in the future?Iâ€™m referring to things like miles card doesnâ€™t reward bonus points on letâ€™s say supermarket and your best other options is a cashback card. Will you stick to a miles card or a cashback card? Given that itâ€™s your bulk of spending,btohqsg
1 thing about boc and icbc I don't understand is they don't have a strong rewards card to compete against citi rewards  dbs woman and uob rewards card.,btohqsg
I would stick to the card that gives the best value for each mcc and draft my credit card set-up accordingly. No need to stubbornly stick to either side. Go where the wind flows,btohqsg
But thatâ€™s you. I was asking his opinion since all he talk about is miles and hotel points,btohqsg
Conclusion is best opinion is don't have own opinion. No need ask liao ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
I think why hsbc nerfs on fast food is maybe they already check on their side. .. not many people use revolution to eat mac  bk or KFC....,btohqsg
Revolut keep nerfing already.. dont think they will bother about spending rewards.,btohqsg
But I don't understand is why nerfs agoda   klook.. . This is the 2 main spending I use them every year ever since 2021.,btohqsg
Then the more they should give you bonus points on those merchants? To attract others to use it there,btohqsg
That is bad.. revoult should continue to provide competition against other travel cards,btohqsg
Amaze  don't have competitors for rewards travelling,btohqsg
It's very different leh. Revolut  not revoult  began as an FX card  similar to YouTrip. They already give good exchange rates  how to afford to give rewards compatible to what banks give when banks are charging 3ish%.You set up a card that have close to spot rate and gives 4mpd? I will sign up.,btohqsg
Trust bank now requires minimum 5 transaction amount to be at least 30 dollars to be qualified for additional interest  is there better alternative for digital banks?,btohqsg
Yes they need to nerfs something then come out with some thing different to give a direction competition against amaze card,btohqsg
That card will close shop within 6 months lol,btohqsg
Thats why lo.. It's like when Citibank had the 8mpd unlimited spend.. I heard the Product Manager was asked to leave.#hearsayfrom citi friends,btohqsg
Revolut's business model doesn't work that way. Their target customers are debit using people such as students travelling for the first time or retired folks without income. Not every card user will penny pinch every single mile,btohqsg
Haha . But this make more people spends more too,btohqsg
0.o and the bank will spend more than it should to pay for the miles to people... banks need to make money. not lose money.,btohqsg
I think it is the opposite. A lot of people just charge hawker  food court  kfc  FP  Cold Storage n OTA transactions to the cards. Bank doesnâ€™t get many 1x point(0.4 mile) transactions from other transactions. Hence  need to nerf 5411  5814  4722 and 7011.Bank designs the rewards structure of credit cards n hopefully some customers will charge 1x or 0.4 miles transaction to it.,btohqsg
To the bro. I think he referring to this.,btohqsg
