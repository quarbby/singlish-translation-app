I got one v impt ques to ask@chemcer,btohqsg
Why are bv students called bedok viewian and not bedok viewer,btohqsg
later they reduce to 1.5 years,btohqsg
he cant stay in camp for more than 7h straight,btohqsg

why wld a broke student literally bomb sg,btohqsg
punggol is officially the worst cos everytime i go to sch  he also asked me to check my bag,btohqsg
if u ended up late bcos of em,btohqsg

if rbf is grounds for check then,btohqsg
i no need go anywhere alr,btohqsg
they explain that to me üíÄüíÄüò≠üò≠,btohqsg
maybe they thought im from china ?,btohqsg
there‚Äôs so many people from china ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
kids nowadays  all up to something,btohqsg
u go buy the stuff needed,btohqsg
Pls write in official complain. Notarize and record the number and frequency of you getting ‚Äúrando‚Äùbag checked.,btohqsg
i never take physics in os,btohqsg
make sure u got ur basics strong,btohqsg
if need external help check yt or websites like khan academy,btohqsg
seems to be the common area ppl struggle with,btohqsg
o i thought it was js me,btohqsg
idk when i hear ppl struggle w physics it tends to be the electricity and magnetism side,btohqsg
I feel like it would be better if it was taught in sec 3 and nt this yr,btohqsg
Because chapters like dynamics is p easy to understand,btohqsg
If magnetism and electricity is brought forward then students can grasp knowledge earlier and knowledge frm sec 2 wont fade,btohqsg
hmm but it makes sense to cover all the newtonian stuff early,btohqsg
can we plagarise some paragraphs for argumentative / discussive essay for o‚Äôs,btohqsg
My essays frm Os to As are all plagarised,btohqsg
10 years alr but my griffith EM still my weakest üò£üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Lowk the best way to consistently do well for GP,btohqsg
easiest stuff. Just ask in the telegram student chat,btohqsg
me nono understand piping physics HAHAHAHAHABA,btohqsg
only difference between griffiths and jacksons is one your integrals are sane the other they are piecewise functions with discontinuities at specific points,btohqsg
sounds like a job for mathematica,btohqsg
ngl some integrals in jacksons are,btohqsg
??  idk if they are even well defined man,btohqsg
i think mathematica does struggle with some of them,btohqsg
then it‚Äôs a perfect representation of my research anyway,btohqsg
then i got a c for the mod so i yolo,btohqsg
Someone made stickers of my poly facis,btohqsg
Dumbass called the stickerpack their class code,btohqsg

Idk why but I can‚Äôt or don‚Äôt feel the effects of caffeine,btohqsg
i cant not drink my daily cup of whatever coffee i feel like drinking that day,btohqsg
I just drink coffee for fun sometimes like any other sweet drinks,btohqsg
I rmb going to HDL a few years ago and asking for coffee‚Ä¶my parents and my cousins were stunned,btohqsg
at least i can study at home more,btohqsg
i drink 4 cups of coffee on sch days,btohqsg
dun understand all this ang moh coffee,btohqsg
i use it at home hahaha,btohqsg
is quite lame  i try find online,btohqsg
i got the coffee bean grinder also,btohqsg
cuz sometime my mom use coffee bean,btohqsg
tbh i nvr bought starbucks b4 lol,btohqsg
i dun understand how some ppl drink it everyday,btohqsg
the only thing i can drink everyday is beer,btohqsg
use color pencil color it green,btohqsg
go out causal dinner lunch w friends,btohqsg
i rarely go out for dinner,btohqsg
if anything..tops up..etc  ill return them the next time we meet,btohqsg
that is how your mindset starts overspending,btohqsg
it ensures that..they cant break their friendship with you on that trip,btohqsg
if not they wont get back money that is owned....JKJK,btohqsg
if its just one meal..$20 max should be ok,btohqsg
for me i‚Äôm willing to go 20+ but,btohqsg
4 ppl 100..so each person 25+,btohqsg
i more so have how much i‚Äôm willing to spend in a week,btohqsg
i schemed with my parents to get $70 a week,btohqsg
told them..if i need breakfast lunch and dinner..each meal cost max $5,btohqsg
that is $15 a day 5 days is 75,btohqsg
thing is like if i specifically go to eat lunch or dinner with friends then i‚Äôll probs spend more,btohqsg
i negotiated and told them 70 ok alr,btohqsg
if it‚Äôs just like because they my colleagues or in sch,btohqsg
right now safe about $200-300 alr in 1 month abt there,btohqsg
i js spent on starbucks again hohoho,btohqsg
60 on one meal..might as well go buffet,btohqsg
in uni i spent about 400-500 a month,btohqsg
oh yea my $70 a week dont count sat/sun,btohqsg
now more like 700-800 a month,btohqsg
had a sec school friend that did that,btohqsg
actually buy them big ass crabs,btohqsg
i‚Äôm willing to spend a lot to try smth good or new,btohqsg
that's what my grandparents decided to do,btohqsg
funny to say.. sg buffets are one the best... having gone spain  their buffet is horrible  same price  intercontinental,btohqsg
so they would go on those fri-sunday cruise,btohqsg
and almost everytime it was fully paid by their points,btohqsg
er... its all the same imo,btohqsg
sounds like someone was eating leftovers,btohqsg
? no leh price q similar,btohqsg
they were not that good either,btohqsg
like 80 at least u lucky if can find 50 in kl,btohqsg
maybe..its because you went the whole day without eating,btohqsg
cause i normally always feel like food is top notch when i have not eaten the whole day,btohqsg
i mean the argument of 5 star ones not being worth is the same idea as expensive meals in general not being worth like,btohqsg
if you just wanna stuff yourself with decent food then don‚Äôt pay too much,btohqsg
If you saw  this what would you rate it,btohqsg
like once in a while i do enjoy smth fancy to say i‚Äôve tried it and enjoy what they put into it,btohqsg
"wonder how i said ""scheme"" my parents  because daily i spend like $5",btohqsg
so im saving at most $10 a day,btohqsg
give or take..maybe out of 5 days  on 3 days...that is me saving $30 a week,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt save much of anything rn,btohqsg
i mean you are at that stage of life i believe where you can afford to splurge for a few years? no?,btohqsg
more so i pay dbs 1.8k a month for my undergrad loan,btohqsg
once i‚Äôm done with that then i‚Äôll save more,btohqsg
plus end of the year i get 500 more a month,btohqsg
the upcoming elections remind me that..i better start watching our politicians more,btohqsg
ltr when i can vote..dk who to vote  then anyhow wack,btohqsg
i literally do not care about politics,btohqsg
for me  whoever looks good gets voted :D,btohqsg
that is what i did for my sec school elections as well,btohqsg
"some guy said ""ill replace all the floor tiles""...literally voted for him",btohqsg
why all of u like bullying,btohqsg
oh yea..you know that tan guy,btohqsg
was a mp for my area,btohqsg
This was the only mp i ever took photo with,btohqsg
üíÄ ur life is beyond saving,btohqsg
had a friend where ite rejected him,btohqsg
dont cry..he is speaking the truth i hope,btohqsg
this one is scdf driver motto ah,btohqsg
had a friend that drove the scdf firetrucks while he was serving,btohqsg
bro was a menace with his car,btohqsg
i think my friend's scdf motto was swerve and speed,btohqsg
Is it normal for this many SCDF personnel to turn up to a car,btohqsg
do yall also call the white blue one alpha bravo?,btohqsg
i end sch in 20 days,btohqsg
probably is jus like a lesson to show parts of car or smth,btohqsg
after than i have a shit ton of things to do,btohqsg
i start mine in uh 3,btohqsg
because if its car fire usually one Pump Ladder will get dispatched  and will have abt max 3 or 4,btohqsg
i have no end and start,btohqsg
tbh my start sch is like,btohqsg
if not pump ladder will be LF  light Fighter? got abt 2-3,btohqsg
monday morning meeting  tues morning meeting,btohqsg
so its abnormal to hv so many for a single car,btohqsg
i dont have alot of lessons,btohqsg
the vid said car wont stop emitting smoke,btohqsg
i have no more lessons ever i think,btohqsg
idt they will dispatch 2 pump ladder jus becuz smoke won't stop,btohqsg
i have yet to get my inversing matrix to below 10,btohqsg
