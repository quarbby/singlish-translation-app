The slot for mile redemption flight also no v gd. N have to book in mnths in advance.  Travel alone ok la travel with friends hard to plan,btohqsg
I see  so I guess I shall continue w my cash back lol though keep hearing ppl used miles to fly business class like shiok,btohqsg
Currently using Citi cash back  minimum spending $800 per month,btohqsg
Past few months manage to get $60 to $80 cash back,btohqsg
Nope  not sure is plus better as mostly use for restaurants,btohqsg
But if can’t hit $800 spending then the cash back very little lol,btohqsg
Same for groceries/fnbSheng shiong use everydayTransport grab/uob absolute may change to everydayFrank card for online and paywave.Others grabcard/absoluteMay consider use back uobone if I can gauge that I can spend 500 to each each mnth.,btohqsg
Me amex for most purchase & scb smart busWait for uob one so slow maybe looking at dbs posb or ocbc 360,btohqsg
Amex pay got $1 Cashback when u use amex pay for SGQR,btohqsg
Depends on you acc u may bi see in app to activate it,btohqsg
Quite Damm good $1 off when u SGQR,btohqsg
Is $60-80 monthly cash back too little or still ok?Too bad already have Citi card.. now Seedly promo for the card so many good deals haha,btohqsg
How much do u spend usually in a month,btohqsg
Lol bro  $100 also below $3k hahaha,btohqsg
I'm stiol thinking posb everyday / dbs live/ ocbc 360 since uob one take own Sweet time to process,btohqsg
One thing not good about Citi is can’t accumulate lol.. every month will auto approve the cash back amount back to your own card,btohqsg
why transport change to everyday? Frank nerfed  online+mobile contactless combined $25 max.,btohqsg
Lol accumulate more then can offset one shot one month spending,btohqsg
haha  dun make sense for money to be stuck in between without interest la,btohqsg
Posb everyday card. 5 percent no minimum spend req,btohqsg
what do y'all think abt this?https://www.tigerbrokers.com.sg/market/maturity-fund?lang=en_US#register,btohqsg
I was looking at this too! Anyone is doing this? I’ll need to sign up for tiger too  any referral links I can use?,btohqsg
locked 1 year not good. Now HSBC EGA/OCBC 360 already almost that rate,btohqsg
Anybody here applied T bills using SRS. Need some quick clarification. Does the DCS (Direct crediting service ) of CDP account necessarily to be SRS account or savings account is fine ? With DBS  I have two account (1) savings account (2) SRS Account. My CDP DCS is linked to my savings account. For the first time I’m planning to apply for T bills using fund in SRS account. If I understand correctly  during the auction date  I will get funds back to my account depending on rate . Does it requires DCS of CDP account or the SRS account is enough? Sorry for noob question. Newbie here. TIA,btohqsg
it's locked for 3 years 😂 in case the int goes down in 3rd year or so,btohqsg
its *UP TO*... which means it could be 1-2% only if any black swan event were to happen,btohqsg
4.71% not guaranteed for 3 years right ?,btohqsg
i think right now FED keep increasing every several months  so better not commit any long term locked deposit.,btohqsg
true~ that's why still on the fence hmmm,btohqsg
I think I will just apply OCBC 360 and keep in that account. Going to change from DBS Multiplier and monitor how it goes,btohqsg
Saw many people got fixed deposit  rate increase and keep taking out,btohqsg
Not awaiting for UOB to join the fray?,btohqsg
End up lose all the earned rate,btohqsg
A bit hard to hit the UOB one card criteria haha,btohqsg
FD if take out no interest and pay penalty right ?,btohqsg
At least OCBC 360 no need to spend and can earn 3.2%,btohqsg
Is ocbc 360 better than DBS multiplier?,btohqsg
For my tier (salary + credit card + mortgage loan)  only 2.1% after the increase,btohqsg
That’s why thinking of changing to OCBC 360,btohqsg
Salary + Save 500 = 3.2% already 😂,btohqsg
Or is there any better saving accounts out there?,btohqsg
if want HSBC EGA can get 4.9% 3.9% 3.9% 3.9% for 4 months.,btohqsg
sorry  anyone used Frank OCBC debit card  any way to get 5 eligible transactions in easiest without spending money?Does topping up grab count,btohqsg
It stops after 4months? What’s the interest thereafter?,btohqsg
That’s great.Just that I do not spend a minimum of $500 for ocbc credit card,btohqsg
I see. I checked their website and it is so confusing to understand haha. So far they debit the money in on time? Saw in Hardwarezone forum so many complaint,btohqsg
after 4 months  move out to ocbc first before join following month (if rate is good),btohqsg
Oh not spend. Is the daily average balance need to increase 500 for each month,btohqsg
Not going to get OCBC credit card. Have too many cards on hand lol,btohqsg
because their reference month always month prior (for example for nov-feb  referencr month is oct),btohqsg
no need ocbc credit card.. just credit salary + save $500 mthly increment already 4.05%,btohqsg
Great. I thought need to spend with their credit card as well,btohqsg
if u spend with their CC then 4.65%,btohqsg
its not tough to achieve at least $500 spend tbh  especially with 365card that rebates utilities payment (but the 365 requires min spend $800),btohqsg
Hi guys  just to confirm again  topping up petrol is eligible for the 10x points for Citi rewards card right?,btohqsg
Concept of time value of money,btohqsg
Hi Chris and fellow members  if we were to purchase some luxury goods during our overseas travel  the best cashback combo would be using the Instarem Amaze tagged to the CIMB World Mastercard? It would earn Instapoints and 2% cashback respectively based on my brief online search. Do share your thoughts if there are better offers.Thanks!,btohqsg
Yes  thats what i said in CIMB video,btohqsg
Is topping up flashpay through app considered online transaction?,btohqsg

Seems that not many fans of hsbc ega. The qualifying terms are the easiest  no salary  spend  insurance or investment requirements. Mechanics are complicated  but basically just have to ping pong every month with your spouse or family member.,btohqsg
And if you are on dbs home loan... Even better... As your salary crediting can earn you posb cashback bonus.,btohqsg
Ya mostly ppls already got acc at uob ocbc posb,btohqsg
Anyone got idea if I use ocbc titanium to pay at hookee will get points and if I use Samsung pay to pay at restaurant with citi cash back card will get 6%?,btohqsg
Hsbc everyday plus add on also gives you additional 1% on all giro. I use it for my credit cards. The advance cards also gives you up to 3.5% with relatively few exclusions for up to 2.8k in spending  with no minimum spend  quite decent.,btohqsg
hsbc is good if you really have the time to digest all their T&Cs and frequent tracking of every bonus interests program etc.Definitely not for the lazy people or 'faint hearted' lol,btohqsg

Yes  the security issue is from Citi Bank. Your limit using the temporary card has exceeded. You can only continue using your Citibank card once you received your physical card,btohqsg
Don't need top up. Just use the instarem once linked,btohqsg
Ohokay thanks lol I spend like less then 200sgd only,btohqsg

Hi  long time lurker here planning to sign up for my first credit card (preferably cashback).Some background: have been working full time for more than a year  expenses are pretty low (~500 per month) and are mostly spent on food (mainly hawker food with payment by cash) and ez link top ups with the occasional online purchaseI  have some qns to ask:1) For stan chart credit card   which is more worth it   the stanchart unlimited cashback or the SMART card? I feel that while the unlimited cashback may suit my needs more  SMART card has higher cashback for categories that I use mainly and has no annual fees  which is quite a draw for me too2) Is it possible to link a bank account from a different bank to pay for credit card statements e.g using a dbs account to pay for bills charged to a stan chart credit card ?Appreciate any comments and suggestions on what type of cards to get !,btohqsg
1. Depends on what food you eat. If mostly fast food or coffee and toast  then get SC Smart. Otherwise SC Spree or SC Unlimited + Instarem Amaze may be better2. yes  should be available on ibanking,btohqsg
If this is your first SCB card  should just get SCB SMARThttps://hmsg.link/scbsmartfor the $300 offer. Spend $500  get $300 within 30 days. After that then decide again whether SimplyCash (Unlimited) or SPree or SMART is better for you,btohqsg
Is there any card that is good for insurance and Utilities. My utilities a month around 200 that's all. I assume only credit card is good or any debit card good for it too,btohqsg
The best way is to tally up your expenses for the past months  calculate how much cashback you can get had you got either card  then choose the one that nets you more cashback,btohqsg

is there a good way to maximize the use of UOB Absolute amex overseas without getting hit by the FX rates?,btohqsg
Yeah  was thinking of this too since Amaze card can't link UOB Absolute Amex. 🤔,btohqsg
My gut feel is top up GPMC and link to amaze but I don’t know if this could be the best.Perhaps there’s more opinions here,btohqsg
Can GPMC be linked to Amaze?,btohqsg
Prepaid mastercards can't be linked to amaze,btohqsg
okay means my method is out,btohqsg
Can use UOB Absolute Amex to top up Wise / Resolut and withdraw money with the cards oversea?  Can UOB Absolute Amex be added to Google Pay?,btohqsg

But you need to know that need to do the payment via starhub website itself and not axs etc,btohqsg
Hi members. I got a question to ask about Citi Rewards MasterCard. If used on booking of air tickets  is it earning just one mile per dollar or not earning anything at all? I asked because the booking website is charging 5% fee for all credit cards except Mastercards. So weighing my payment options.,btohqsg
for mastercard better use DBS Woman World MC for 4 mpd. CRMC only get 1x = 0.4 mpd for air ticket,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  quick question:Can I use Citi PremileMiles card to pay for a private hospital bill to earn miles?*,btohqsg
It seems to be excluded. Might not even earn any or 0.4,btohqsg
ocbc titanium can it be used to pay singtel shop? and still qualify for the 4mpd,btohqsg
With a 5 percent fee  it is not worth it in term of any value. Would like to know where u purchasing the ticket from,btohqsg

are there any banks that are a bit more forgiving with this? i tried applying for SC and got rejected recently 😞,btohqsg
Why would first time applying card fail the credit score?,btohqsg
Dont worry too much about this. Even if you have perfect credit score some banks will still reject your application,btohqsg
so i should just try a different bank for now?,btohqsg
yes  choose from Citi  SCB  HSBC  DBS  AMEX  UOB  Maybank  CIMB fromt.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg

Hi  any idea if there is a credit limit for amaze card or it follows the credit card that is linked to it?,btohqsg
no credit limit for Amaze. Limit is on the linked card.,btohqsg
DBS for pooling of points.Citi for transfer partners and the ability to use Citi PayAll during promo to ‘buy’ miles.,btohqsg
Hi all. Just wanna check… i just got my citi premiermiles approved and there’s a digital card in citibank app now. So i tried making a flight booking.. got thru submitting to the end but end up the said card was declined. Is it i need to wait for the physical one to reach? 😅,btohqsg
I use SC Jumpstart card. You might also wanna look into POSB/DBS's HomeTeamNS/SAFRA debit cards as well,btohqsg
Hi gurus  anyone tested the Amaze card’s exchange rate for spending in Malaysia? I checked on 2 occasions and found that the conversion rate is about 1% from the Google rate.,btohqsg

Can I just double confirm Citi rewards cards $500 qualifying amount. Is amaze card spending on non exclusion mcc spending is part of the qualifying spending,btohqsg
If it is non exclusion mcc then it is qualifying spend,btohqsg
If favepay link to Citi cash back card able to entitled the minimum spending of $800?,btohqsg
As long as mcc not exclusive it goes toward qualify spending for minimum spending. However it might not qualify for bonus cashback and just entitle to base cashback of 0.25 if mcc does not fall under the bonus category,btohqsg
1. go dbs ibanking lock a dbs card2. attempt a transaction at the tuition centre using the dbs card. Transaction should fail since card is locked.3. Go chatbot on dbs ibanking. Check past transactions. Get the merchant category code for the failed transaction.4. Cross check if the mcc is eligible on citibank card.,btohqsg

im using uob one card  ive started using only for a few days and the monthly statement already arrived but the bill did not even add up to 500. does that mean that for this quarter i will not get cashback? thanks,btohqsg
U can call uob to know how they calculate,btohqsg
Hi can i check if most cashback/miles cards that states ineligible for hospital bills  does it also apply to private clinic checkups and cosmetics/minor surgery?,btohqsg
Hi all  I'm new here.Would like to check  if we top up instarem Amaze with the UOB Absolute card  would that still be eligible for 1.7% cashback?,btohqsg
Amaze only allows Mastercard credit/ debit cards. AMEX not accepted.,btohqsg
How about Amex > Grab > Amaze combo? it should work.,btohqsg
Sounds plausible. Any thoughts on this?,btohqsg
cannot link Grab or other prepaid cards to Amaze,btohqsg
If you're trying to spend on overseas merchants  you have better odds going by Amex > Grab > YouTrip/Revolut rather than Amaze,btohqsg
Grab top up is cap at $200 per month,btohqsg
Youtrip and revolut exchange rate is better then amaze,btohqsg
Just tried this and can use the promo code after signing up Instarem with the referral link,btohqsg
So what is the ideal to earn on amex? Because they only offer Grab capped at $200 for me.I m using krisflyer amex,btohqsg
DP  pay fwd insurance use grabpay (not GPMC) still get 6 points,btohqsg

UOB Absolute Amex  or rather Amex  seems not so technical friendly and not so inviting in easing consumer to use it. Can't add in to Google Play  and Can't link to Amaze Cards. 🤦‍♂,btohqsg
I dont think is amex issue  amaze work with mastercard,btohqsg
If it was that easy to exploit  trust me you won't be getting the 1.7% unlimited with little to no exclusions,btohqsg
True but I think it helps if Amex can gain partnership with Google and Nium (Amaze Company?) to accept their card?,btohqsg
Partnership is not that easy as u think,btohqsg
Uob amex does not fall under amex  uob control it,btohqsg
Maybe  but I guess Master Card and Visa Card market share much bigger?  So gaining the partnership AND giving good cash back rate may help? 🤔,btohqsg
Amex does not depend on reward  they depend on service provided,btohqsg
Mmmm.. strong supporter of Amex? 👍,btohqsg
U need to understand how reward is been given and how co brand card reward is given to know the flow of such collabration between company,btohqsg
If Amex gotten acceptance as partner  guess UOB Amex get it too? 🤔,btohqsg
With some spread will be 138-139,btohqsg
Have exact breakdown? Want to do big amount with your method,btohqsg
Bank are the one who give out reward for co brand credit card  (except amex issue card),btohqsg
Bank earn from terminal usage from merchant and rental of terminal,btohqsg
I thought there is a Amex Cashback Carl similar to UOB Absolute Amex?,btohqsg
Which is why u see terminal with uob citibank dbs etc at merchant,btohqsg
Amex true cashback can be added to samsung pay,btohqsg
Must not only see Singapore leh  to most multinational companies Singapore mkt is not even relevant. AMEX is huge in US,btohqsg
Like certain offer is only to amex issue charge and not to bank issue amex,btohqsg
It is too simple to just brush it off saying amex not working with google or other payment system. It is 2 way traffic  if it doesnt benefit google why does they want amex on board,btohqsg
So amex need to entice google or other company to work with them,btohqsg
This is business point of view  so if u see from consumer point of view u wont see it,btohqsg
Truth is  banks are not here to look after your interest  but their own KPI,btohqsg
Scb Damm fast same as Amex not the uob amex,btohqsg
If u applying from Amex u can add to mobile payment app like apple pay Samsung pay example but not the uob Amex,btohqsg
"Correct.  If Amex think easing usage is part of good service  then probably they need to think of ways to get into more ""mobile payment ecosystem"". 🤔",btohqsg
U can always write in to amex to feedback,btohqsg
Does Amex works in Google Pay?,btohqsg
I use samsung pay  google pay i rarely use. I am happy with the reward by samsung pay,btohqsg
Just gotten the UOB Amex and just sharing what I encountered.  Card which ease my usage I use.  If don't  not a big deal to me. 😊,btohqsg

If u dont have a bank account with the bank  u can request them to issue cheque,btohqsg
Amex pay $1 deduct promo Is damn good 👍😊,btohqsg

If you have previously applied for credit card(s) with the Bank  the relevant cashback cap applicable for purposes of determining the cashback you will get under this Promotion is the cashback cap in place when your very first application for credit card(s) with the Bank was approved(“Previous Cashback Cap”). For the avoidance of doubt  this Previous Cashback Cap may be lesser or greater than the Current Cashback Cap.If you have not reached the Previous Cashback Cap as determined by the Bank in its sole discretion  the cashback you will receive pursuant to this Promotion is the lower of:the cashback (if any) you are eligible to receive under Clause 2 above; andthe Previous Cashback Cap less the aggregated amount of cashback you had earlier received under any and all other credit card sign-up promotions with the Bank. For the avoidance of doubt  if you have not reached the Previous Cashback Cap  the Current Cashback Cap has no bearing on whether you receive cashback under this Promotion.If you have reached the Previous Cashback Cap as determined by the Bank in its sole discretion  you will not be entitled to any further cashback under this Promotion. For the avoidance of doubt  this is the position regardless of whether the Previous Cashback Cap is greater or less than the Current Cashback Cap.,btohqsg

Do u suggest to keep changing my OTP number to the local sim card number whenever I need to verify the topup? Or how do u guys go about for this situation  are there any other verification methods such as code sent to email? Thanks!,btohqsg
After first top up  u can save the card inside revolut or youtrip. No otp required when i top up with saved card via grabpay mastercard,btohqsg

I also did the top up and didn’t get the cash back so I thought is spend using cards.FYI  the 50 cent cask back they did say within 3 working days. But they never say any about 10% top up. Maybe they will follow like a statement or calendar month like CCs.,btohqsg
i was referring to the SIF GoSaver,btohqsg

for online purchases  since CRMC is already eligible  should i still use instarem or just use CRMC directly?,btohqsg
i mainly purchase from shopee as well since 11/11 is coming soon too haha,btohqsg
Better exchange rate for foreign currencies,btohqsg
i guess it's similar to what Haroon was saying  if i purchase from foreign merchants like taobao then it's better to use instarem card instead,btohqsg
If shop in Shopee MY  then Amaze card better then bank rate. But transferring from CIMB SG to CIMB MY gets better rate then Amaze if have account in both countries.,btohqsg
so i have to make payments with the physical amaze card for dining  if i want to convert it to online transaction right?,btohqsg

Tried multiple times  same errorPlease click on retry to continue your application.(Reference Code: A22)Any idea how to solve?,btohqsg
Using WWMC by Apple Pay consider online transactions? Can earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Give them a call if u forgot or missed the letter,btohqsg
Yes  just like when u use atome. U can check out pace mcc code online,btohqsg
if tap phone  it is mobile contactless  not online. If transact via an app/website that allows paying using apple pay it is online.,btohqsg
Oh… mean using Apple Pay in McDonald’s app is consider online.,btohqsg
Which part of application are you stuck at,btohqsg
I received email indicating the application reference number but when I go to website to resume  no records found,btohqsg
Singsaver is saver. Citi is citi. These two are separate campaigns,btohqsg
Citi get citi gifts. Singsaver get singsaver gifta,btohqsg
Sorry my bad. I am refering to SC smart. I used your referral link,btohqsg
So which part are you stuck at? Disable AdBlock or use incognito,btohqsg
If you have submitted application to SCB  you will receive the application number. Use the applciation number to apply at the singsaver email,btohqsg
Anybody knows how did the latest TBill 6mth get allocated? Applied for 5k using cash  got allocated 2k only..,btohqsg
That mean it is oversubcribe so it is prorate allocated,btohqsg
Yea I know that  but how did 5k get u 2k? Another friend applied 1k using srs and got 0,btohqsg
I'm guessing you did non-competitive and got a prorated allotment owing to non-competitive bids being > 40% of issue size  while your friend either(1) did non-competitive also but got 0 because after proration  the amount is less than the minimum issuance amount / denomination or(2) the bid yield for competitive issuance was higher than 4.00%  resulting in no allotment,btohqsg
Thanks! I understand now. The minimum denomination of tbill is 1k.,btohqsg
Thanks. CS helped me check informed although there is app no. but it did not go thru. Hence I have to reapply again,btohqsg
Kindly check my dm for work,btohqsg
DP: OCBC reject my credit card application despite being a Frank Credit cardholder. Guess I won't get the additional 0.6% for OCBC360,btohqsg
How can we track the $500 daily average increase for OCBC 365 if we transfer out a portion of the salary to other accounts? So we have to top up $500 plus the amount we transfer out to achieve it?,btohqsg
For HSBC revolution card  how do I covert the rewards to miles?,btohqsg
On your OCBC account dashboard on website  it will show,btohqsg
Do I have to register with hsbc their mileage programme?,btohqsg
oh! already have the titanium but i see the coverage not as good compare to CRMC+amaze,btohqsg
I just applied last night hope it goes thru,btohqsg
My chances are low too since I cancelled 365 card in June,btohqsg
why for T Bills i apply 5000 they refund me 2000. i thought T Bills no quota like SSB ?,btohqsg
Banks will say reason cannot be disclosed,btohqsg
Ever since i close 360 account 5 years ago they have been rejecting me,btohqsg
Wow they bear grudges for more than 5 years,btohqsg
i applied 10k non competitive  refunded 5k,btohqsg
Beginners Question:If i have a requirements to pay by giro. is there a way to bypass this to set up recurring charged to my CC while still considered as giro payment.,btohqsg
What bank account do you use now?,btohqsg
Didn’t they pause withdrawals? I tried withdrawing to Gemini via usdc but it didn’t process,btohqsg
Already paused...big read heading on the website some more....,btohqsg
Bruh you are 4 days late,btohqsg
Telco and ultility. Basically my telco is under staff plan and they require me to giro. Thus thought to make use of ocbc 365 to set up recurring.But dont know if this count as giro,btohqsg
Wont count as GIRO as GIRO is for bank accounts. But see if your company can accept credit card recurring paymentsReference:https://www.starhub.com/personal/support/article.html?id=4GbTedCDXq9GKJ26CA4pL8#:~:text=Sign%20up%20for%20Recurring%20GIRO No%20worry%20about%20late%20payment,btohqsg
Not cool Chris - no need to be snarky. Many of us signed up through FTX via your referral. You don't owe it to us but doesn't make it cool for you to laugh at the victims,btohqsg
Thanks for the feedback but I didn't come from a snarky viewpoint  more of answering the question  but ok point taken and I will be more mindful in what I say,btohqsg
FYI:@laurent_riowas the first to alert about FTX in this group  so credits to himhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/35978,btohqsg
both T bills and SSB have quotas. It's just that they are usually undersubscribed,btohqsg
Anybody knows the best way to use/redeem UOB UNI$ ?,btohqsg

Citibank rewards card need to do this?,btohqsg

Hi is there referral link for ocbc 360 and 365?,btohqsg
Hi can I check whether do I receive miles for dental payment with citi premier miles card?,btohqsg
can the annual fee of $40 be waived annually or not?,btohqsg
Anyone else here waiting more than a week for ocbc 360... 😢,btohqsg
If to miles is most value for money. Always wait for conversion bonus if there is still long expiry,btohqsg
This is processing fee  cannot be waived,btohqsg
Now is sort of bank run. [crypto exchange run] so probably all will crash like hell.,btohqsg
Hi all  intend to sign up for the citibank credit card via singsaver. The due date to apply is 15 nov. I have not had cpf contribution for about 10months. Started a new job since 1st oct  so my cpf contribution should come in on the 14th of nov. Wanna ask the folks here  with only one month of cpf contribution  will my CC application be successful?,btohqsg
Not likely  they may ask for additional docs like payslip  employment agreement  etc,btohqsg
Any good deals/free gift for 11.11?,btohqsg
I won a 11.11 scratch card from Gpay,btohqsg
You have 19 hrs left to withdraw before the ceo of CDC  reveals their assetsHe just twitter 5hrs ago,btohqsg
Do you register first or wait until you have sufficient points to convert?Also same question for applying KrisFlyer membership. Thank you 🙏,btohqsg
Only when you want to convert  otherwise it's wasted.Krisflyer anytime can apply,btohqsg
Wish they maintain the free lounge access😅,btohqsg

U can google alot of horror story,btohqsg
If got $$ suggest pay more and not get prism/ Xiaomi,btohqsg

"can i ask something about Shielding? what happens if i shield my SA  but my OA is not enough to provide for the full RA FRS? when i ""un-invest"" my SA  will the amount be automatically top up when i ""un-invest""?",btohqsg
Hey Chris  after filling in my email add in the first page  when I got redirected to the cimb page  they ask  'are u referred by a friend?' Shd I put yes or no? They also ask  'Do you have a promotion code?' what do I fill in if any?,btohqsg
No need fill in  as long as you've clicked through my singsaver link,btohqsg
Generally shielding is for people who have enough OA to form the FRS amount for RA so to be honest  im not confirmed about the treatment of funds uninvested in this case,btohqsg
Ok applied thru your link already. Saw the fine print need to spend 988 within 60 days of card approval too?,btohqsg
Yes  can use it on big ticket items,btohqsg
https://www.foodiesg.com/archives/52459?fbclid=IwAR0MWumvjj7nbC4VUJ5qNfxls12YsBJJeiPgrEY8Cm_JnXtQ-xcXHndzBOEsorry in Chinese. Tldr 3.5% pa fixed deposit 3mth or 3.8% for 5mth at dbs  minimum 20k quantum,btohqsg
"It will not auto swip SA to RA after you unshield at age 55. However  CPF will ""autuoswip"" SA to RA at age 65 to form FRS before the payout. If you want to maintain your SA  you may top up RA to FRS with cash if any.",btohqsg
People used to shield their OA (the first 20k earns extra 1%) when taking HDB loan  because based on the old rule  your OA will be wiped out. After that  the rule was changed. Now  people have the option to leave up to 20k in their OA.Hope the gov will change the rule for SA to benefit the people.,btohqsg
Is Dbs yuu card any good ? :),btohqsg
Thank you for replying.*new updateCause I brought the extended warranty (tv 1700 + extended 200+). Now they are offering either a replacement tv (rrp 999) or a store credit of 999. Which one should I take? Is the value fair? If I choose store credit  which brand you guys will recommend? The store doesn’t carry TCL or XM. Only have Samsung  LG  Sony  sharp and Philip 😞I just want a reliable and long lasting tv.,btohqsg
In my experience Sony bravia quite reliable followed by LG,btohqsg
Like that then don’t pick sharp/Philip.. the other 3 should be safe..personally I feel LG smart tv user interface quite polish and intuitive .. if u want android tv option then go with Sony,btohqsg
hi  if i spend online (e.g. ASOS) and get a refund after  would it still count towards my minimum spending?,btohqsg

Btw for webull the usd 100 trade can it be fraction stock ?,btohqsg
My sharp is still working. It has been 6 years,btohqsg
This CIMB hotline service is almost nonexistent. Called the main hotline and cc hotline  both not picking up. Tried the option of leaving a voice message which they said would call back after one working day  also nv call back.,btohqsg
It is only during this period of interest hike as they offer good rates . I think is long wait for most banks now. Previously I used to rate cimb hotline much better compared to other banks.,btohqsg
You just continue to hold and put on speaker phone. I manage to talk to them yesterday and the day before,btohqsg
I manage to call on the night time instead,btohqsg
Ya understandable I call cimb before at Office hours lunch time ok quite nice talk too,btohqsg
Hi all 😊 I have a cpfia account and have been investing my OA through poems .I realise I have about 8k to invest in SA and wanted to do so into S27. May I check if I can just purchase it through poems stating SRS ? What are the requirements needed to invest SA funds ? Do I need to open any additional account or just CPFIA is sufficient ? I saw there’s an option for SRS so I didn’t consider endowus for now,btohqsg
Having such a horrible time with HSBC..takes more than a month to process cards and only after reaching out to them a month after getting my card to ask about my samsonite luggage  they are telling me that you’ll have to opt in for marketing to be eligible for it 🤦🏼‍♂️,btohqsg
Yeah it sucks but this is mentioned in the t&cs,btohqsg
Hi  do you happen to know if I have charged the air tickets to DBS women's World  would the travel partners be covered for it and if it covers for covid19?,btohqsg
Cannot use CPF to buy S27  only SRS through Poems Cash+.,btohqsg
For the Citi Rewards card $350 cashback via singsaver - if using the card via Instarem is also counted? Or have to use the Citi Rewards card directly?,btohqsg
Till now I still dont know why bank reject some applications even if their credit score is good,btohqsg
Transfer out ($Salary - $500) =$XXi think,btohqsg
in the desktop website  when you go into your account details  they actually have a summary for it,btohqsg
Maybe hold too much cc card ?,btohqsg
not really  assuming salary not credited on 1st of month  need to calculate how much to leave in the account such that average daily balance is $500 above last month,btohqsg
I have youtrip  but don’t see this  is this targeted?,btohqsg
I have Sony too around 4.5 years now and still okay  but Sony prices is at higher end,btohqsg
Hi guys  I just applied Citi PremierMiles card few days ago. Is there any wait out period before I can apply for the next few credit cards (i.e CRMC  hsbc revolution  DBS altitude etc)? As I’m expecting big expenses in the next few months so wanna max out those miles cards.,btohqsg
Processing of credit cards applications may take longer than normal  some even one mth nowadays  do apply earlier.,btohqsg
Hi. What's the way to earn cashback by top up youtrip?,btohqsg
Any better card to be spent at overseas  mostly JB?,btohqsg
Instarem > hsbc revo seems a good choice for miles if not Amex true cash back ( disregard   sorry for the wrong info!),btohqsg
So Amex to grabcard then to youtrip? Coz youtrip only can use mastercard topup,btohqsg
I’m using Instarem card though   they have their own cash back system as well haha   I’m not sure about youtrip 😅 seems like only gives good fx exchange rate only ?,btohqsg
hsbc revo cannot link to instarem,btohqsg
Ohhh ? I thought recent honey money says can ? They stop already ?,btohqsg
Nerf with Citi but still works with Amex,btohqsg
uh  only mastercard can link to Amaze,btohqsg
Oh my bad it’s Citibank cash back + hahahaa,btohqsg
So you still get amaze cashback?,btohqsg
I mistook hsbc revo   it should be Citi rewards master,btohqsg
Ya price on higher side vs other,btohqsg
Saw Samsung QLED Damm nice but scare of Samsung always got issues die young same as lg,btohqsg
Hey guys... Quick quick check in  if I use Kris+ to pay the promo sats 3miles / dollar  and using gpay I used a 4mpd card (assuming no mcc issues)  I should get 7mpd yes?,btohqsg

how much u paying? Dun make sense to pay using cardup when the cardup fees is going to be larger than the cashback or miles.,btohqsg
5 digits  and no credit card accepted,btohqsg
Damn I only see this msg now. If only I refer to this chat for help damn!I just converted to USD and do a bank trf from ftx which obviously didn't work. URGHHH. 😭😭😭I tried to do it on the 7th 630pm.And now the platform is hack well done Sam. Till the last moment still didn't forget to scam the remaining money and run.,btohqsg
Anyone is same as me? Just wanna know I'm not the only loser. Is damn sad. Damn pain.Lost money staking anchor protocol. Then lose more money at hodlnaut. Then the final blow lost it at FTX too.These are the only 3 platforms I used for crypto. Not blaming anyone. But I only used it caz I see even our local content creator talks about it.,btohqsg
seriously 6.30pm 7 Nov? Damn bro  I managed to withdraw between 4-5pm 7 Nov  cuz I had some time in line at the bank. Sorry to hear that.,btohqsg
It does not show how many points per transaction,btohqsg
May I check what other options other than cardup for renovation payment?,btohqsg
I don’t think any other bank give the details too,btohqsg
If we pay uob$ merchant with EVOL card  will we still get 8%? Or UOB$? If uob$  will it count for $600 min spend?,btohqsg

Hi@ChrisHMSG  or any one here can enlighten me  for the uob lady’s solitaire card every $5 for 20miles for category spent   if it is ordinary spend it’s 1UNI$ or 2 miles  then should does this mean even the ordinary spends is more than the UOb airmiles cards where every $1 = 1.4miles?,btohqsg
no matter it will be cashed out early following month,btohqsg
2 miles per $5. Thats 0.4 mpd  very bad,btohqsg
Was hoping this comes out everytime u post a video haha,btohqsg
I want to consolidate in my uob no other choice,btohqsg
uob uni$ across your uob cards are pooled. Can try get 10x points (4miles per $) on other uob cards for these ordinay spend.,btohqsg
Yes  they are quite smart the MCC are different from bars/restaurant some can be quite grey. The bars and restaurants are of different category. So we have to choose wisely,btohqsg
can use other 4mpd uob cards (e.g. mobile contactless using uob ppv) for these grey ones,btohqsg
Will I get 4mpd using hsbc revolution via kris+? Thanks,btohqsg
Couple of possible reason that I could think of such as track record with the bank. Example always sign up then cancel. Maybe income level not that high but alot credit card. Etc. I have had personal experience of being near perfect credit rating but took 1 month for my UOB credit card to approve after countless spamming on their hotline/email. Doesn't make sense.,btohqsg
yes if the merchant category code is under the whitelist for 4mpd,btohqsg
Thank you! Thinking of FairPrice finest. Contactless  it should work right?,btohqsg
I am annoyed that bcos of the delay  I become no longer the first xxx to apply for the CC and not get the extra miles,btohqsg
I have emailed them to rage about this but been one week. No reply. UOB customer service seems quite sucky in general. Their SLA all rubber band timing one.,btohqsg
Welcome to the club. Been 45 days - already lost my “first xyz applicants” reward and also interest rate on the ONE account.,btohqsg
I dont see the cashback from yesterday meal,btohqsg
For Kris+  fairprice finest only accept krispay miles for payment. Btw Kris+ is online not conractless  not that it matters for hsbc revolution cos both are ok so long mcc are in the whitelist,btohqsg
I think nerf Liao.. game over,btohqsg
Trust bank and Sc bank credit limits linked ?,btohqsg
Under offers  I don’t see the 50cents cashback banner anymore,btohqsg
New user to SC smart card. Their SC app did not statement or appear any due date for the bills. May I know is this common issue,btohqsg
Anyone know if the uob absolute CC also will have 1.7% if u use it for public transport?,btohqsg
I had the same issue  u can call them up and take note on the bill amount and date. In my case I paid then the bill appeared…,btohqsg
Good for ppl with excess cash and short duration :),btohqsg
wa shit.. you kena from all 3 major bullets this year..,btohqsg
I also loss $500 from ftx . Did not aware of the news until these few day,btohqsg
when it comes to crypto  u have to be rather on the ball with news esp during winter season bear times...,btohqsg
Those with money/coins inCrypto.com  please be extra careful as well. No centralized exchange is safe in this current sentiments,btohqsg
Uob tmrw app does give break down now,btohqsg
Uob $$$  should count toward the 600,btohqsg
This is for block for $5 dollar u get 2 miles  other miles card is 1.2 to 1.4 per dollar so $5 u get 6 miles or 7 miles,btohqsg
Need some advice from the community experts. Can I apply another Citi Rewards card while my Citi PrestigeMiles card is still pending for approval? Or will the bank reject the application?,btohqsg
Dont think amex can be use for simply go unless u top to grab and use grab for simply go?,btohqsg
U can always send in application to try. Internal criteria of how the credit team approve is really case by case,btohqsg
sian sia i use their CRO card actively lol,btohqsg
More likely to be rejected since your credit score will be affected,btohqsg
If UOB  can apply. Anyway you’ll be waiting maybe 6 months to get approved😂,btohqsg
Oh no.. that’s long 😂 even though I have uob one card? Existing uob member,btohqsg
Nah I’m just kidding. But yeah they’re slow af. I have a UOB One  waiting for the CC application for 1.5 months already🌚,btohqsg
Which means it’s a better off card somewhat even without the category spend eh?,btohqsg
Still mcc have to be not excluded,btohqsg
Quite confused in that. Means No MCC it’s shitty? Miles card is $1 = 1.4mileLady’s is $1=2miles but blocks of $5,btohqsg
move to liquid pay now if no more nestia CB,btohqsg
