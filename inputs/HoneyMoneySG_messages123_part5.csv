Precisely because  of all these wrong and misleading  info posted that I stopped reading honey money  for a while now. Skipped 5000 messages and still see all these misleading  post. Give up.,btohqsg
One black sheep stir up the whole forum with people not wanting to read anymore. Keep input incorrect info,btohqsg
Been helpful is good  but trying to be helpful but give mostly wrong info is dangerous. 越帮越忙. 好心做坏事.,btohqsg

Hi all  i just applied for the citi premiermiles. Wanted to confirm if getting amaze card and linking will be good for paying 1k amount each month for Banquet in earning the 4mpd.,btohqsg
Citi premier miles dont need link to amaze unless it is fcy spending. It is citi reward that ppl link to,btohqsg
Guys i have a question  which platform to use to buy dbs shares is best with low charges?,btohqsg
That is good to have uob lady card . For me a must to have is .Uob ladyDBS Woman.Citi rewards pair amaze.,btohqsg
citi premier miles doesnt earn 4mpd,btohqsg
O  thank you. I mixed up the cards to apply.,btohqsg
And that black sheep keeps changing names  not sure if he’s out to purposely mislead people.,btohqsg
Shhh... quiet now.MutedJr Ivanfor 60 days.Reason:Seems like you haven't learnt anything after 30 days of mute from Chris and still there's nothing useful coming from your messages. Stay and read the conversations  learn from them. You have 60 days cooldown to read and understand what people are contributing to the chat. But if you decide to leave before the 60 days  I will permanently ban you instead.,btohqsg
UserVincenthas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:irrelevant image,btohqsg
And he changed name 1 last time before banned,btohqsg
I was thinking why are you banning Ivan,btohqsg
Haha he really got a lot of time sia.. change name  change profile pic all,btohqsg
Be it Anh  Terry  Jasper  Ivan  Adrain  he still@AdrainHoa,btohqsg
lets see who he PMs now,btohqsg
And he leave within 1 min after muted,btohqsg
Another one bites the dust...!BannedJr Ivan.,btohqsg
He gonna create new account to join liao. Need to be alert for broken sentence structure and spelling mistakes,btohqsg
"just watch for the ""bros...""  ""crmc + amaze"" ""amex plat charge"" ""marriot bonvoy""",btohqsg
He can't be bothered reading the chats or changing his username already. You think he will bother creating new account? 🤪,btohqsg
"anyone that said ""nerd"" instead of nerf will probably be him too",btohqsg
Anyway it's not difficult to spot his nonsense. At least we can have proper constructive conversations again,btohqsg
Just realised that there is an extra 1% charge once I charged > 1k on on Amaze paired with CRMC. 😂,btohqsg
Yes. Minimum fee is 50 cents. Been there for few months already,btohqsg
How to cancel yuu card? Dint see any option In bank app,btohqsg
Need to call bank to cancel  cant cancel on app,btohqsg
Can cancel before 1yr of not much use,btohqsg
If we made an online purchase  we should not use our amaze card to pair with CRMC but just charge directly to CRMC right to get 4mpd right?It’s such a habit alr to charge it to Amaze without thinking.,btohqsg
If your transaction is already online and SGD  then skip Amaze. If it's offline/fx then go with Amaze.,btohqsg
Hi just wanted to ask  if I topup a simplygo transpo card using a credit card e.g. uob one  sc smart. Will i get the credit card rewards? Thank you!,btohqsg
Why not just use the card directly? And no you don't get rewards for topups.,btohqsg
For other people I am topping up.,btohqsg
No rewards for your card. They can probably earn some rewards from ezlink tho  when using their ezlink card.,btohqsg
Hi  buy capitastar voucher from capita app using uob evol  will it get any cashback? Not even as other spend 0.3% ?,btohqsg
Oof I think I'll lose my supposedly UOB EVOL cashback. I just found out one of my Jun's transaction awarded UOB$  which puts me below minimum spend. 😭,btohqsg
Hi. What would be a good cashback card for flight ticket spending ?,btohqsg
As usual  UOB CSO giving wrong answer. 🤣🤣🤣Just that this round I don't know which answer is the wrong one  and will not probe more. Hopefully I get the longer end of the stick.UOB CSO said I'm eligible for $38.45 cashback from Jun. This includes me hitting $600 minimum spend with that 1 x UNI$ transaction. 👀However  UOB CSO also states that UNI$ transactions are excluded from minimum spend (as per t&c). 🤭,btohqsg
Hi hsbc ega extra 1% interest  is 5 paynow transfers between two different bank accounts with different name counted?,btohqsg
