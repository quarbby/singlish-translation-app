Save me plz  my groupmates are useless,btohqsg
what do u need to do,btohqsg
I have to fucking reprogram the entire thing by TMR 1pm :'),btohqsg
what do u need the array for,btohqsg
Making a food dispenser that has user and admin settings,btohqsg
Yeah but the array contents need to be able to edit by the cell,btohqsg
Or at least by the row or column,btohqsg
I have no idea how to do that,btohqsg
If I get saved I'm buying bubble tea for whoever helped the most 👉🏻👈🏻,btohqsg
Sian no one can save me ah,btohqsg
I'm broke and I don't live with my parents  can u like have mercy,btohqsg
Not many people know C++ here and the ones who do probably won't help >_>,btohqsg
you asking how to initialise or how to edit and modify,btohqsg
Shouldnt u make it a varchar then,btohqsg
B o t h would be great but mostly edit and modify,btohqsg
Might be useful if you give example c0de,btohqsg
Arent u proficient in cpp too,btohqsg
I am nowhere near 'proficient' lmao,btohqsg
I still have to complete all the extra function in function :'),btohqsg
your 2d array you label the columns starting from 0 left to right,btohqsg
rows top down starting from 0,btohqsg
arr[0][0] is then the top left most cell,btohqsg
arr[0][1] is the cell on its right,btohqsg
I google this I get a microcontroller of some  kind?,btohqsg
I'm mostly concerned if I can put multiple characters inside each little cell,btohqsg
Or will I need multiple arrays,btohqsg
Multi chars as in a string?,btohqsg
each cell is a unsigned char,btohqsg
Unless you init your array to hold that many subarrays then no,btohqsg
Okok let me draw out what I'm trying to achieve,btohqsg
This is more C than C++,btohqsg
yes you can create a 2d array of chars to make it hold an array of strings,btohqsg
yeah lol if cpp i'd be using vectors and strings,btohqsg
How does the program know the memory size den,btohqsg
you have to make the row size the length of the largest string,btohqsg
and you use null terminators per row,btohqsg
Why array  vector.push_back is what E V E R Y O N E suggests,btohqsg
Avtually i might have what u need or smth similar,btohqsg
If whay ure asking is smth like a tile,btohqsg
Where in a tile map u can asdign numbers,btohqsg
And the numbers mean diff things,btohqsg
Dunno  need question asker to really clarify end-goal,btohqsg
Also microcontroller big sad  niche area,btohqsg
It's an even more niche area than general programming btw.,btohqsg
It's very close to the silicon,btohqsg
So I need to be able to add new rows,btohqsg
Cant u just use a rdbms for this,btohqsg
@Alexandra_WildeCan you use vectors? Dun think arrays will work >_>,btohqsg
i can only recommend that you use a struct,btohqsg
Nope  c++ only cuz that ain't in my sllybus,btohqsg
