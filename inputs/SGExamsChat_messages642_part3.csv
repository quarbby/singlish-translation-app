Subject combinationH2 Maths is generally compulsory unless you didn't take A Maths.The most popular subject combinations for science students is PCME or BCMEP - Physics  C - Chemistry  M - Maths  E - Econs  B - Biology.PCME is most popular followed by BCME. And for good reasons.When you choose a subject combination  you have to start by considering what you want to study in university.Because... every A level student will have to continue to university studies to make sense why you take A levels.And to decide what you want to study in University  you will have to start by deciding what you may want to work as in the future after graduation.From there  you have to search through the university criteria to check if there are any JC subjects pre-requisites.For eg  NTU Engineering required H2 Physics previously as a¬†pre-requisite,btohqsg
"You may google ""Indicative Grade Profile"" to find out.For some of the local unis:https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/undergraduate-programmes/indicative-grade-profile-(igp)https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/indicative-grade-profilehttps://admissions.smu.edu.sg/admissions-requirements/indicative-grade-profilehttps://www.sutd.edu.sg/Admissions/Undergraduate/Application/Admission-RequirementsIndicative grade profile gives you the minimum score you need (look at the 10th percentile) to enter the course.If you go deeper into each course  you will find additional information in their undergraduate programs and the¬†requirements.",btohqsg
