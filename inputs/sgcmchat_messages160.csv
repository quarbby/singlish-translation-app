how much is the LH monster locally,btohqsg
sgfr i can respect cos they actually send people out to other countries to buy it,btohqsg
You try once never try again,btohqsg
yeah you mainly buy it because either A. its not in sg so its a import or B. influencer,btohqsg
i dont get the hype though,btohqsg
their demographic for these kind of shit is pri sch bro,btohqsg

the overlay might be a pain in the ass to set up though,btohqsg
i think sticking with AC mods from RD is still the safest bet.,btohqsg
i usually run with the GT7 HUD,btohqsg

owner always respray every 2 weeks,btohqsg
I‚Äôve seen two go on sale in the market before though,btohqsg
Unless they are the same cars,btohqsg
The owner make two listings of the same car üî•,btohqsg
Welp ik where he stays now,btohqsg
last i saw a yellow mk3 was at yishun,btohqsg
The white and yellow is diff plate though,btohqsg
Ones a classic car plate and ones a regular playe,btohqsg
yeah u can get 2 plates under your name,btohqsg
Changes between a classic plate and a regular plate???,btohqsg
Ya then when uw drive the car js tell LTA,btohqsg
Cos classic only can drive a limited amt of time per year,btohqsg
So when the owner need then he change,btohqsg
But why wld u buy a classic plate den put a regular plate u pay lower COE for classic,btohqsg
the owner told me he havent register the other one stil waiting for approval,btohqsg
nvm i looking at wrong thing idk,btohqsg
Den it don‚Äôt make sense to get a regular plate?,btohqsg
but regular plate means can drive everyday,btohqsg
was at yishun fr few weeks,btohqsg
Ya it‚Äôs like how my R33 got classic plate then my Corolla is regular,btohqsg
LTA wants people to drive classics more,btohqsg
Then ifuw drive the R33 can apply switch,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why they encourage them to drive everyday,btohqsg
classic cars or classic car plate,btohqsg
yep this is the newer one,btohqsg
but can still get the plate rite,btohqsg
that's why the mk3 got 2 plates,btohqsg
This u got see b4 anot,btohqsg
Last pic ever took of it,btohqsg
Yea but change plate n spray,btohqsg

feel sad for the younger guys in here who are so into cars but when they become old enough to actually buy a car  it will either be way too expensive or everything will be fucking boring electric trash,btohqsg
as someone who wants to get a car within the next 5 years  this sucks alot,btohqsg
FD2R prices would be through the moon  don't even need to think about the more unattainable ones like a 997 GT3...,btohqsg
5 years is a decent amount of time  with a miracle  coe prices might become more reasonable. but short of something unexpected happening  the trend is not your friend. rip,btohqsg
Honestly buying a house in msia and getting the gt3 would be abt the same as jst getting the gt3 here,btohqsg
if i have a few mil laying about yes,btohqsg
