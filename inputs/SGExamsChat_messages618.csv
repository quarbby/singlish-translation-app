if bedok 90 can you treat us hdl again,btohqsg
LMAO open paper first question already cant do,btohqsg
Can i ask how long u take to go to school,btohqsg
because i would usually be tired alr,btohqsg
after a whole day of school,btohqsg
What stays in sch stays there,btohqsg
i did that for 5 months straight,btohqsg
And trust if ur whole mood is study u will forget what u study after a week,btohqsg
i don’t study all the way,btohqsg
Sleep minimum 7 hours unless its exam period,btohqsg
Cos on the bus i gt nth to do and i get bored so i whipped out my phone and did sls/watch videos for school,btohqsg
since I have other things to do,btohqsg
Then i managed to jumo grades,btohqsg
Sleep and drool with mouth open wide,btohqsg
I’ve been getting max 5 hours of sleep kekw,btohqsg
Thats like the most important thing i've learnt from studying last yr,btohqsg
I used to study 4hrs straight,btohqsg
I had a total of 12 hrs sleep for past three days,btohqsg
Then one day i was like fk it,btohqsg
And i can feel my heart pumping harder,btohqsg
i got more sleep during the weekend,btohqsg
Then i started studying on the bus and super early in the morning before getting ready for school,btohqsg
because i only got like 10 hours of sleep for 3 days last week,btohqsg
REAL bro my rbf face stagnated thruout the day,btohqsg
No one dared to approach me,btohqsg
Then night and aft sch is for doing hw then i sleep,btohqsg
If thats your norms den go ahead,btohqsg
Dont change things that work for u,btohqsg
help ive been getting 5hrs of sleep,btohqsg
I'm a normally 7-9/10 hrs sleep kinda person,btohqsg
And i thought it was normal,btohqsg
My body clock is js like that,btohqsg
Is that how fked up your body block is,btohqsg
no use for me to sleep at 10pm if i still feel tired when I sleep at 10pm,btohqsg
so I might as well sleep at 12 and still have the same energy,btohqsg
if i sleep the normal amount i need i end up super hyper,btohqsg
that's what my grandpa usu do,btohqsg
i'm used to being tired af,btohqsg
Then go living room window stretching,btohqsg
its js kinda interesting how majority of the people ik w shit sleep schedule are all under 170,btohqsg
okay maybe 5 hrs is too extreme,btohqsg
Bro I had 4 hrs for past three days,btohqsg
But i wld say least amt of sleep i wld get is 6.5h,btohqsg
5hr if i cannot sleep like rn,btohqsg
This week from Tues to Fri I ending at 5pk,btohqsg
but i never exceed below 5hr,btohqsg
I can only imagine if you were to age,btohqsg
i barely met the cutoff lmao,btohqsg
sec1 i can still think properly with only 3-4h of sleep,btohqsg
one thing i liked about ns was the healthy af body clock,btohqsg
now if i only sleep 3-4h  i would need an 8h of sleep the next night to recover,btohqsg
run a few hours before your sleep,btohqsg
because if you run only 1-2h before you go to bed  your HR may be too high to fall asleep,btohqsg
idw to sleep 1 hr when im old,btohqsg
mine is just really bad dark circles,btohqsg
run 10k  100 push ups  100 sit ups,btohqsg
im planning to run my age distance on my birthday this year,btohqsg
So i stopped studying until 12,btohqsg
Like max i wld go was 10pm,btohqsg
Then i immediately close book go rest,btohqsg

But i wld lie on my bed for 2 hrs then go sleep,btohqsg
Fking hell how do u run 22km,btohqsg
That's track and field A div ppl,btohqsg
sis im not running at 3min/km pace lah,btohqsg
Bro prob has daddy long legs,btohqsg
From outlook you'll appear taller ish,btohqsg
this one im sure  im way heavier than you,btohqsg
This dude Ik ard that height and he has skinny asf built,btohqsg
He's the kind you'll think is a stickman but when he bat baseball  with only one hand end up homerun,btohqsg
Alright good night i am going to zao now,btohqsg
i wish i am average .-.,btohqsg
baseball batting is more technique on the hip,btohqsg
It's also cause he was calisthenics in sec,btohqsg
use your phd in physics to explain to us,btohqsg
you turn your hip first so you create tension in the body,btohqsg
your arm follows like a slingshot,btohqsg
Guys normally heavier than girls no meh,btohqsg
Why u sound like u toned asd,btohqsg
bro....the real truck is her bf,btohqsg
Oh ya wtf is a dp,btohqsg

I'm down to stay anonymous (kinda ish),btohqsg
p easy for people in their 20s to just meet,btohqsg

Speaking of meeting online ppl  I've recently been catfished sia  I met this dude last 2 months ago and that fker doesnt look like the pic he send,btohqsg
DUDE UK the thing is I didn't even ask him to send and he decided to send a tiktok vid? Of himself in it,btohqsg
my 20s feels like a simulation,btohqsg
Aiya wtv it is   that vid looked natural asf so I didnt ask much,btohqsg

ill be dr burette by your mid 30s hopefully,btohqsg
ngl if i ever become a prof or smth,btohqsg
that's when i leave this group,btohqsg
actually bedok is way quieter irl i realised lol,btohqsg
like it's really awkward to be in this gc in that position,btohqsg
esp if it's a sg uni,btohqsg
like you talk nonsense here then your student be like EH PROF,btohqsg
and of course the live reaction rand ang sticker,btohqsg

"Until I was meeting him irl and I couldn't find him cause that fucker late for 4 hrs( overslept apparently oh what a surprise 🙄) and I had to pass him this ticket cause I help him buy days prior.When he called me I'm like ""whr u at"" ""oh I'm in Uniqlo "" then fker made me walk down in and about uniqlo and i still cant spot even his fking shadow bruh  then he went "" oh Ur inside?"" my mind was swearing alr BITCH u said "" u were in Uniqlo! ""I went outside of Uniqlo  just nice he was behind tapped my shoulder and I turned bro my expression instantly change  but luckily my entire face was covered like kpop idol",btohqsg
He built like a fking Lego Minecraft,btohqsg
The face like str up square,btohqsg
it DID NOT look like the pic he send me,btohqsg
Ever since then I stopped contacting that fktard,btohqsg
Uk it's funny cause I was in cosplay  and prior to meetup we agreed to do like kabedon and shit for fun and tiktok,btohqsg
But then I'm lucky we didnt,btohqsg
Also that bastard didn't know how to wear his fucking cosplay,btohqsg
Dude didn't even know where the toilet was,btohqsg
How tf am I suppose to know,btohqsg

Ya there's signs everywhere but he keep treating me like a maid,btohqsg
He's a freaking fully developed fking human,btohqsg

Bloody mf asked me to help him with it,btohqsg
"""didn't U try this on before""""Yea I did but I forgot to wear""""???""DUDE it's not that complicated 😭",btohqsg

"Uk afterwards  we went Watson to get his makeup shit  and I was like "" oh it's x pm alr"" ""then he's like oh u can go first""",btohqsg
Idk man then when I confronted that fucker he like paiseh asf,btohqsg
Didn't rlly wanna talk abt it,btohqsg
Like bro I get it at least have the decency to apologise,btohqsg
But still how did it end up that way,btohqsg
My first time wasn't that trash also,btohqsg
All he had to do was wig and clothes,btohqsg
feels like when u late shld at least tell how late ah…,btohqsg
late for 4 hours you still entertain,btohqsg
Also cause there wasn't a designated time like he said oh ard xpm then I'm like oh okie cool,btohqsg
"bruh i cannot do ""about xpm""",btohqsg
just give me a specific timing,btohqsg
then again my friends never on time,btohqsg
looking at you bill and yt,btohqsg
yknow i always come late on purpose,btohqsg
so i might as well come late,btohqsg
And cause on Tele  how uk the person fk up or Mia?,btohqsg
Ngl i had high hopes initially cause we hit it off q well,btohqsg
It wasn't a date or anything also,btohqsg
''guys are simple creatures  just by talking to them  they get the wrong idea'',btohqsg
No LOL he's like oh I gotta wear this first,btohqsg
Anw ever since I dread meeting online ppl,btohqsg
Idt every guy is liddat but to think a guy or a fully developed fetus can turn into smth liddat is extremely horrifying,btohqsg
be clear with your standardbe like rand,btohqsg
Like I get that I didn't ask for his face pic but uk we work on a basis of honesty system here cause online friends mah,btohqsg
Also the pic he send right  and me hearing his voice B4 prior meet up,btohqsg
I thought damn the voice and face don't match,btohqsg
next time  video call before agreeing to meet  like test water yknow yknow,btohqsg
We did disc call no face reveal lah,btohqsg
How can a filtered pic look that natural,btohqsg
girl say hi also can be taken the wrong way,btohqsg
got some regulars say hi to me every morning :/,btohqsg
Like the face dimensions is so diff,btohqsg
i've had p good experiences meeting people from online,btohqsg
Dude I'll say this lah  if u ugly nvm but if u fishy   cryptic and have  questionable personality I ain't fking witchu,btohqsg
Also if u have questionable personality,btohqsg
my best friend from USA came to sg to meet me few years back,btohqsg
i met like 2 online friends during my grad trip,btohqsg
yknow what's worse than catfish - carousell deal meet up  you reach the place then the buyer pull out on you,btohqsg
in hindsight the dutch person could've killed me and i couldn't do anything about it,btohqsg
considering i went to their house,btohqsg

Neither a square nor a pentagon,btohqsg
I like how the side characters aka yt friends alr acknowledged me as his gf when neither of us acknowledged whoever yet,btohqsg
we are the best friends characters in the anime,btohqsg
it's fun to fan the flame,btohqsg
not say cannot sleep but not sleeping yet,btohqsg
when u think they put the result on singpass,btohqsg
if im not wrong  there was another way to check on SEAB website itself  release same timing as school  at least that was the case for a level results,btohqsg
bur most likely only hours after result release then they putup,btohqsg
Lol paiseh I projected alot didn't I 💀 it's just my blood boils everytime I talk abt it,btohqsg
is this some post nut clarity,btohqsg
I was so in the zone that I didn't notice otherwise 🗿,btohqsg
Never will I dream of the day of meeting you bunch irl,btohqsg
as far as online people go,btohqsg
Ik but I just had a bad exp recently and am pretty done w that shit for awhile now,btohqsg
not like i have a lot of time to meet anyway,btohqsg
5 days to do 3 weeks of work rmb,btohqsg
uk it's funny because that's what I FR thought that  before I met that dude,btohqsg
But I won't say a definite no,btohqsg
It's just we'll see how it goes,btohqsg
ok ykw imma keep your expectations of us being normal low,btohqsg
research means if brain not working means rlly cmi,btohqsg
like imagine you spent hours working on smth that no one do before,btohqsg
one small mistake fuck everything up,btohqsg
or worse  you don't notice it until meeting with prof,btohqsg
yea it's all chill lol doesn't rlly matter,btohqsg
i know where to find the guy toilet unlike your catfish,btohqsg
uhh what's ww and wt here,btohqsg
if someone who take PhD can't do that,btohqsg
you say no shit when you literally found someone that can't,btohqsg
and how old is this guy,btohqsg
ok so legally allowed to fuck but cannot find toilet,btohqsg
you say this as though the PhD has ANYTHING to do with it,btohqsg
I thought ppl are q old when they take PhD,btohqsg
At least that's what I associated with it,btohqsg
if a girl takes a phd in sg they can be 23,btohqsg
i started mine in 2022 when i was 25 so -2 without ns,btohqsg
also i set my list of things to do tmr,btohqsg
"uk you'll prob swear at me but all I can think rn is just "" DAMN Ur old""",btohqsg
just feel way more wise about things lmao,btohqsg
Now why does that make u sound like you aren't if I didn't say Ur old,btohqsg
hello anyone learned how to drive at 18 is driving hard,btohqsg
Sticker to show that ur right,btohqsg
That's the worst kind of retardation I've ever experienced,btohqsg
i did the entire thing in like 3 months,btohqsg
I only put up with it cause  it's his first time cosplaying and our first and last meet up,btohqsg
i think the only intimidating part is maybe first time behind the wheel,btohqsg
i heard it cost around 3k,btohqsg
nah it’s like ik im older than almost everyone here but im not old old yet (probs when i finish my phd and yall in uni lol),btohqsg
so i just try not to be stupid,btohqsg
depends on if you go sch or private also,btohqsg
and how many tries to pass the tp test,btohqsg
could i ask my relative to teach me,btohqsg
Oh ya isn't there like uni tuition or smth,btohqsg
but i would have to go singapore to take the test,btohqsg
they can teach you skills but,btohqsg
you need to have proof of taking lessons under someone that’s licensed,btohqsg
so ig if they taught you first then you go take lessons you can accelerate it,btohqsg
r u gg say smth like he's not even worth getting angry over,btohqsg
car in sg very expensive 😨,btohqsg
i do not intend to drive in sg,btohqsg
but yea the procedure here is basic theory test -> start taking practical lessons -> take final theory test -> practical test (subject to sufficient lessons),btohqsg
ok understand  did you find the theory challenging ?,btohqsg
but since you're smart our standard of challenging may be different lol,btohqsg
like all about the road signs etc,btohqsg
second test is more common sense like what to do in x situation,btohqsg
the books give plenty of examples,btohqsg
90% to pass which makes sense for driving,btohqsg
just drive illegally first to get on the job training,btohqsg
then you go take the tests,btohqsg
i would do it but not in sg ig,btohqsg
thank you for your input and help 😀 !,btohqsg
Uh how much is it normally like generally,btohqsg
like 10k a year for singaporeans,btohqsg
then i took a loan from the bank to pay 90% of it first,btohqsg
How to go uni liddat 🤡,btohqsg
i started with 30+k loan that i paid over the past 1.5 years,btohqsg
can finish within next half year,btohqsg
anyway sg one not too bad price wise,btohqsg
I think he's too unavailable for me cuz he ckw 😔,btohqsg
if he ckw shouldn’t he be more available,btohqsg
But he's at kranji camp wot,btohqsg
Idt he's the type to go out of the way to meet someone like me LOL,btohqsg
I maybe wrong but it is what it is,btohqsg
then got 60% chance he will get up for it,btohqsg
tbf you could offer him army ration and it’d do the trick too,btohqsg
Is it just me or I feel like alot of ppl v hyped up abt me and yt 😭,btohqsg
idk if hype is the word i’d use,btohqsg
yall two the deleted texts just added to it LOL,btohqsg
no we love fucking with him,btohqsg
Man so I just implicated myself,btohqsg
plus this chat is filled with people that fr nothing better to do,btohqsg
Dawg I'm just downbad for muscular man 😭,btohqsg
it’s like if you ever said ok joke over getting old alr,btohqsg
most of us just go ok sure,btohqsg
Bruh am I now part of the sgexams history,btohqsg
p sure to be history you need to be stupid,btohqsg
you nvr notice meh all the legends we rmb is bc they aren’t smart,btohqsg
Ngl even irl I just stare abit 2-5s if one walks past me,btohqsg
Cuz I mean it's not like they're there to stay amirite or amirite,btohqsg
My locked on target is yt,btohqsg
And im just simply carrying out the purpose of human eyes,btohqsg
Idw cancelled but uk how women wear revealing shit  I mean guys look also....,btohqsg
It's same when men wear liddat and girls look also,btohqsg
Or maybe it's just me lah,btohqsg
bro went from not showing his face in 2022 to full on gym ns bro in 2023,btohqsg
Uk it took me q awhile,btohqsg
I had a convo with him before in this exact chat,btohqsg
But like I'd said back then no face reveal,btohqsg
The pfp just two capital letter YT with a pink background,btohqsg
now he openly show face  show name,btohqsg
Wah fuck I have competition ah,btohqsg
Don't liddat my heart can't take it,btohqsg
He's not only mine to own ( sadly),btohqsg
uk the reason being so shameless is also cuz I have no intention of meeting him irl,btohqsg
Like that thought didn't come across my mind,btohqsg
Like who's crazy enough to do what I did and meet irl lmao,btohqsg
Yt this be me next time we meet,btohqsg
you’re the most textrovert textrovert ever,btohqsg
also i wanna see that irl meetup happen in like a few years,btohqsg
Yt we meet when I 90 rp,btohqsg
If I can have a build liddat I happi alr,btohqsg
Can easily lift yt like a sling bag,btohqsg
I run abit got abit alr,btohqsg
i only got some build in right arm,btohqsg
I only have a bit of bump,btohqsg
Like it's almost non existent cause skinny  lean,btohqsg
All the fat went into wrong places,btohqsg
my right forearm is quite noticeable bigger than left,btohqsg
I still got veins popping out tho,btohqsg
Not that visible but if I flex hand can see kinds,btohqsg
i’d rather get a more overall lean look,btohqsg
Body clock fked lol I slept from 7 ish to 3+,btohqsg
Took bus to mrt only to take bus back to home,btohqsg
try to sleep tho if not the next day you’re even more fucked,btohqsg
those ppl somehow end up leaning on some stranger's shoulder later,btohqsg
this is somewhere at punggol alr,btohqsg
zzz imagine gg to sch be like this everyday,btohqsg
cuz got ppl frm tp and ite,btohqsg
1 time i took at night after cca and it was still so crowded,btohqsg

Need take shutter bus to get there,btohqsg
And usually need walk back coz the by the time to reach u the bus gonez rdy,btohqsg
I didn't even know I'm like that,btohqsg
Is that tomato or spicy sauce,btohqsg
when does bedok give correct answers,btohqsg
cb i might be the first batch to officially come back for reservist,btohqsg
I just wan stay home until ord,btohqsg
That's why I reminding him 😔,btohqsg
I mean beats me cuz the only time I actly know more abt uni is from this chat,btohqsg
China only ard 150k rmb for 4 years,btohqsg
Back then when mrt wasn't like today,btohqsg
oof then I rmb wrongly ig 💀,btohqsg

me  sine cosine and tangentI'm tangent,btohqsg
Actly can someone add that dude nat back,btohqsg
Mmm would u say normally ppl would take a loan,btohqsg
Cause in no way they can pay 10k per year unless they sell themselves,btohqsg
just need to think through 2021 and 2022 A lvl grads,btohqsg
all i want is a1 for hcl,btohqsg
i’m probably gonna take a day off studying today,btohqsg
But usully u can apply bursary,btohqsg
90% bank loan is usually sufficient  because $1k a year,btohqsg
Or find part time job to do while waiting for uni to start,btohqsg
it's really not a bad country to stay in,btohqsg
Uh speaking of which   does As or degree help earn more $ for pt,btohqsg
I feel like no diff for both,btohqsg
If u have only A lvls hard to find job,btohqsg
if u have a degree  why look for pt,btohqsg
If u meant finding pt job while studying it doesnt matter,btohqsg
usually is ft plus take pt masters degree for those who want to continue studying,btohqsg
alternatively take 1 more ft year to complete masters,btohqsg
but masters not needed for a lot of stuff,btohqsg
Usually part time job is like $10 and above depend on what u are working,btohqsg
Wait till I 90rp then say,btohqsg
I think I babysit kids btr,btohqsg
Bro i took psle in 2012,btohqsg
clean preschool toilets pay damn shiok 17/hr,btohqsg
Is just human nature for them at that age to be lazy,btohqsg
But yeah i would say tutor rn is the best pay per hour job,btohqsg
add on to that:don't underestimate anyone regardless of their educational levels.,btohqsg
Damn u don't sound like your age,btohqsg
I thought same age as kuro,btohqsg
Yeah this and i always tell my friends that u can be a retard when comes to studying but u dont be a retard when comes to 做人,btohqsg

Retail and sales dont look at educational cert,btohqsg
Kuro korkor you cant js leave us hanging,btohqsg
Oh and 1k+ too cause I work extension till days B4 my sch open,btohqsg
Usually ppl after o and a will go do part time like packer  cashier  sales,btohqsg
i might go tuition center after alvl,btohqsg
But uk I'm happy with it cuz I can choose fruits and veggies now,btohqsg
anyone who w me as housewife :D,btohqsg
If u go center u are their staff,btohqsg
i agree  no experience don't go centre and teach,btohqsg
And you r your own boss,btohqsg
So lets say u got 3 student under u den its x3 per hour for u,btohqsg
Dealing with 5 little kids at once is keesiao leh,btohqsg
