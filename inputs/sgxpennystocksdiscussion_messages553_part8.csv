Some background on Vividthree since it looks like recovery plays are on the way. Have held this one for some time since the last play up and then they went to rest üòÖCheck the link for those interest in some background of Vividthreehttps://t.me/sgxpennystocksdiscussion/382397,btohqsg
This stock is not for contra. Buy only if you can pick up. The buyer‚Äôs queue will just disappear on contra due date.,btohqsg
Hoping it does better this time around.The liquidity range is much higher.Reason being placement then is at $0.250. No cheap shares so if players want to play  it needs to go higher.Finger crossed. Hope for the best,btohqsg
GHY Culture's proposed Clover Films stake purchase falls throughhttps://ift.tt/3BZbESNOctober 15  2021 at 07:45PM,btohqsg
I tracked vv3 before  the volume was around 8000 lots during the November force sell period last year  many retailers and maybe some bb bought cheap so the price need to go above $0.08 for them to take profit and move higher.,btohqsg
Are you holding some. Thanks for your analysis üßêDr Hou did married deal at $0.070.If players want to play they need to push much higher then we can see real market participation. I think 6 series onwards if it gets there would be much more active,btohqsg
I am holding for some time already. 1 year plus,btohqsg

CEO Jed mok  only own 16 000 vividthree shares  one of the directors jay and a substantial shareholder sold shares at $0.17 and $0.15 shortly after ipo  and with share price so much lower now  CEO jed and jay also didn‚Äôt bother to buy back the shares too.https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/5IBW4ZKN1P6VJ1TI/555235__FORM1_HWC_FINAL_230419.pdfI would say Dr Ho $0.07 buy is insignificant,btohqsg
What is interesting is if you look at the top 20 largest shareholder [19 - Soh chun Bin],btohqsg
Thanks for your view . Appreciates.The difference is that this founders are not rich. They were never rich. So they would be tempted to get some money on their hands when the opportunity came.On the other hand   Dr Hou  is smarter money.,btohqsg

Smart money? Beside vividthree  he owns advance holding since 2014  and see where the price now  I would say he has spare money,btohqsg
Vividthree results coming next month  I expect result will be surprising good  who knows  maybe they won the exclusive right to develop squid game VR?,btohqsg
They just need a venue  to do their vr show and based on last time  one vr show will yield them $1m profit at least  and this alone  can push the price back to above $0.12 at least.Just buy and keep the shares in your Cdp  do not contra  and let the bb do their job  dont disturb them  until it is high enough,btohqsg
