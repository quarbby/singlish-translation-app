Bit of a shame. It was a nice green area,btohqsg
Just to have a better gauge. Any one have any idea how much income (before CPF) must we show in order to get abt $350k loan?,btohqsg
U apply HFE already they can calculate for u,btohqsg
My last time HLE loan my wife and my income combine 7KMax loan up to $480KBefore my wife become PR  my ownself 1 person only loan max is $290K.So i believe if u need $350K load combine income likely need around  $5K-6K,btohqsg
https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/MonthlyInstallment/MonthlyInstallmentCalculate$1588 monthly OA (23%)But they cannot deduct everything. Need to keep some for something like death insurance. And as you age  the cpf contribution gets lesser.So to be safe $2000 monthly OA (23%)Your salary must be $8695 (100%) so to be safe about $9000 and more. Tbh is not easy to loan that much. Mine earning is about $7000 also less than 300k loan.,btohqsg
Wah we about the same but my loan was less than 300k,btohqsg
Depends on how old u are and also how much cpf u have along the yrs . Because if me alone with $290K without my wife i also still can get the 4rm hdb non mature areas . Because I already not young anymore and my cpf alone also can pay for downpayment and monthly installments,btohqsg
My wife become PR then hdb calculate my wife income in as co owner. So likely i no need loan max 20 yrs. Just loan for 15-16 yrs,btohqsg
just loan 20 yr then change after that lor,btohqsg
u wont be able to tell the future,btohqsg
20 yr loan interest quite high. If 20 yrs and I'm just 20+ yrs old im ok to loan 20 yrs maybe 40+ done.If im 33 already wait for bto keys come 36 20 yrs after is 56 wa too old liao,btohqsg
Just take the max loan first then if can prepay back also no penalty right?,btohqsg
if anyone has feedback on this feel free to pm me!,btohqsg
Will there be bto at the former faÅ•rer park stadium   former cambridge sch 1 n 2    former pek kio cc land?,btohqsg
Only will know when HDB announce upcoming plots,btohqsg
can google for ura singapore to see what govt has planned for it in the next 10 years  but subject to changes also. if itâ€™s residential  then could be bto or condo  only hdb will know,btohqsg
No penalty but ur monthly payment is same locked,btohqsg
But you clear ur accrued interest faster,btohqsg
How much money should me and my partner have in our cpf to bid for a 4 room flat? We just started working only,btohqsg
I lay out the payments you need to do on your first  second and third appointment.First Appointment: Option fee 1-2k cash via NETS depending on your room type.Second Appointment: 5% of your unit price if you are under staggered downpayment scheme  otherwise it will be 10% of your unit price.Buyer stamp duty (low 10k to high 10k  near 20k)HDB conveyancing fees (few hundred dollars)If you are taking bank loan  10% of unit price  out of which 5% must be in cash if you are under staggered downpayment scheme  otherwise it will be 20% of unit price  out of which 5% must be in cash + BSD and HDB conveyancing fees + lawyer legal fees ($2.5k-3k)Third appointment: remaining 15% if under staggered downpayment scheme  otherwise remaining 10% plus  the other fees stated below,btohqsg
So for now you need to have enough to cover the first and second appointments,btohqsg
XY laid it out very nicely  but I just wanna add that apart from the dp and other fees  you just need to ensure that you have enough for loan (if using CPF) by the time of key collection (when loan payment starts),btohqsg
Simple as it is depending on your location of bto.If you are conversative kind go for lower price unit or you are confident enough just select the unit of your choice within your budget.,btohqsg
Every fee laid out here is using CPF OA except option fee via NETS?,btohqsg
You can choose to pay in cash but yes with the exception of the option fee  the downpayment  HDB conveyance fees and stamp duty fees can use OA to pay.As for the 3rd appointment  the remaining downpayment can use OA. Not too sure about the other fees as Iâ€™ve not made it past there yet ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
So second appt need to pay stamp duty in cash already???,btohqsg
Like can be 20k extra in cash? I thought option fee only in cash + 10% from cpf,btohqsg
Your cpf not enough then cash . Yes stamp duty need to pay already,btohqsg
Yep stamp duty but you can choose CPF or cash,btohqsg
Btw for those with grants  the grants can only cover the downpayment part  any other fees have to be paid from you using CPF/cash,btohqsg
Oct 2023 results are out :),btohqsg
Do note that from this launch onwards  these are the changes in rules:- if you get a queue number within supply  you cannot apply for future launches until after your selection appt- if you're out of supply  can apply for future launches  but if you get a selection appt  future applications will be cancelled AND if you reject then  you will be given 2nd timer status for 1 year (exception if there are 10 or fewer flats by your selection appointment; 5 for SBF)- once you reject once  you will be given 2nd timer status for 1 year,btohqsg
The 'Long Island' Project how do you guys think will affect the Bayshore BTO demand,btohqsg
I think Bayshore demand will already be sky high without factoring this in. I view the long island project as positive so I can imagine that demand will only be higher with this,btohqsg
True2 but form seaside residence become reservoir side residence hahha,btohqsg
That's true too! Didn't think of it like this,btohqsg
It'll be the first public housing in that area for ages and ages  I wonder how high the application rate (And the price ðŸ˜‚) will be,btohqsg
Hi is there a link to Queenstown Nov 2023 bto chat?,btohqsg
Please see here for full list!,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know where can we view the floor plan of the houses?,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not released by HDB yet. You can join the telegram group here first:https://t.me/KallangWhampoaSept23,btohqsg
How to check number of drop out for bto?Thank you,btohqsg
U can't check. Only when selection time then u can check dailyMeaning per day 10q number to be called but if that day the unit gone is 8 means 2 dropped out lor,btohqsg
U get what i mean ?Example last Q of the day number 10U login to hdb and check take up rate is 8 means 2 never go la,btohqsg
Ok noted thank youLast time saw a live table from other groupShow the number of drop outOn the first day over 100 drop out,btohqsg
And prediction that dropped out rate will be super low because of the new rule.  if never select once get invited  u dropped to 2nd timer for 1yr,btohqsg
So don't expect dropped out rate to be high,btohqsg
anybody knows if hdb is releasing sale of balance ?,btohqsg
That one...1. That's on a project to project basis - every day they track the number of units taken compared against the number of appointments that day2. That's tracked by volunteers. Ultimately a community effort because last queue number can only be seen by those with appointmentsJust FYI! You can also start that for the HDB launch you applied for :),btohqsg
But what's the benefit of tracking such stats for other than those booking the flats?,btohqsg
