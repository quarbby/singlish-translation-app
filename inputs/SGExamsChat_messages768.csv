Umm I learnt piano in Japan as well. So the lesson is in Japanese,btohqsg
I was like... Well it is a two birds with one stone so why not,btohqsg
Is it rly hard to pick up though? Like after 5 years there‚Äôs still difficulty communicating with them,btohqsg
Actually pretty hard to pick it up,btohqsg
Well if you want to perform tourism and really get the best out of it  its actually not that bad,btohqsg
By that level  you should be able to enjoy anime and all,btohqsg
The difficult thing is actually business Japanese,btohqsg
Bro going to get the rod now,btohqsg
Gg I guess I should not do a business related job should I move to Japan,btohqsg
For real even if the place is quiet doesn‚Äôt mean the food is bad,btohqsg
I was watching a lot of shorts from this YT channel called JapanEat  quite a few of the good looking food are from shops that are not in plain view,btohqsg
ngl some of the corner shop dont want to become popular,btohqsg
Because they are small business and cannot cope with too many customers,btohqsg
And they are already earning enough to self sustain and keep the business afloat with their current customer base,btohqsg
tutor came as i was just about to fall asleep,btohqsg
always dam spot on idk how,btohqsg
Japan actually has a lot of hidden gems,btohqsg
I legit cannot stand people who say CECA,btohqsg
Me hoping for Japan 2025 (I'm damn delusional),btohqsg
Doesn't sound right when I say I hate Indians vs I hate CECA,btohqsg
"A better term would be ""South Asian""",btohqsg
sorry whenever i see elitist now i immediately think of her,btohqsg
I don't think so but ye apparently it's a girl,btohqsg
Ntu renossiance (I can't spell) engineering program: am I a joke to you,btohqsg
On this episode of sanest Singaporean,btohqsg
Bro's first thought is to sniff,btohqsg

@Ryannnnnnnnnnwhats the group name tht u got the ss from,btohqsg
I saw the beef y'all had üò≠,btohqsg

moght be the cable this time,btohqsg
as much as i hate gp  i also love gp,btohqsg
at this pt i dont even associate with my past sch because of these kind of things lol,btohqsg
this guy is the #1 yijc glazer,btohqsg
bro is back at talking nonsense again!,btohqsg
i see him in every jc post,btohqsg
"the ""alumni"" that dont wanna associate with yijc because of the ""alumni"" that made us not wanna associate wont respond",btohqsg
isn‚Äôt most ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù alumni from the separate jcs,btohqsg
Who the heck is this dude?,btohqsg
like back when innova was innova and Yishun was Yishun,btohqsg
i seriously wonder if it's raes alt,btohqsg
my sch have many successful alumni,btohqsg
my friend from my batch got straight As so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ,btohqsg
he keeps on shunning polys and only thinks highly of people from top schoolsalso doesn't know the difference between racism and homophobia,btohqsg
dhs ask alot of alumni to come back,btohqsg
"honestly its pretty interesting that news only document the best and worst stories so the middle is just ""rotten sch""",btohqsg
they asked a female navy reggie to come back for saf talk and she was my friends classmate,btohqsg
the thing is  idk what this guy is yapping about  he can't even provide a proper argument about top tier jcs over polys and keeps on generalizing things which makes him sound confusing af,btohqsg
its kinda how i view reddit  its like either really debaty people or really biased people or really weird people,btohqsg
lol I deleted Reddit and my friend said ‚Äúgood job‚Äù,btohqsg
i still believe sgexams has useful stuff and im open to making amas  but please lah some people don't even think before they comment,btohqsg
bro said lousy and thought he cooked,btohqsg
"also bro it's ""than"" not ""then""",btohqsg
technically sji is lousy compared to ri hci,btohqsg
so idk what he is yapping,btohqsg
i mean if you wanna go to hwach which is 1h away compared to xxx neighbourhood school your call,btohqsg
"""uhm actually lousier is when dumb students go to a school because they do not satisfy the cop for top schools""""ok then explain dumb""",btohqsg
but xxx neighbourhood school isn't lousy,btohqsg
actually one reason why I chose DHS over NYGH and RGS is distance,btohqsg
"key battle will find a way to bring in random examples like people vaping and doing shit in exams which doesn't even connect to being a ""lousy"" school",btohqsg
technically singapore is lousy because we don't have china's economy,btohqsg
this is something key battle wld say,btohqsg
why even compare in the first place bro üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
they say comparison is the thief of joy  yet here you are complaining about how your friend has a better life than you when you don't even know what problems he is facing,btohqsg
I mean Harvard got its brandings compared to NUS,btohqsg
all that just to lose to yijc 100-0,btohqsg
i wanna see acjc vs acsi finals man,btohqsg

People will be more impressed with Harvard than NUS,btohqsg
Of course the school fees in Harvard also very impressive as well,btohqsg
I mean doesn't every sch have like,btohqsg
Vaping and dunno what cock shit,btohqsg

My impression of Lawrence Wong is this....,btohqsg
"bro is going to add another tax called skibidi tax and say ""womp womp i love increasing the cost of living so cope harder""",btohqsg
Can send me link or some sht,btohqsg
Like when he introduced the budget  like machiam some super cool ass PW project name one,btohqsg

ok as much as key battle is üíÄ lets not demonise him for thinking this way,btohqsg
if i ditched art  i would not even be passing it,btohqsg
everyone has diff standards and then keybattle wanted ri/hwach but he couldnt get in with his psle score,btohqsg
So its natural he think his psle not good enough,btohqsg
lets assume like.. most psle tuition is 1.5 hours,btohqsg
he would need to have 12 sessions over FOUR SUBJECTS,btohqsg
anyways al10 is like 240 around there,btohqsg
Bro wants to go RI year 1,btohqsg

Why my phone pointed me to there,btohqsg
Kuro must have been using his powers to force you to backread,btohqsg
I did not know got such combi  both music and drama counted as humans right?,btohqsg
21 February has been allocated to you,btohqsg
does anyone have medical knowledge hereüòß,btohqsg
do i need go see doctor,btohqsg
cos i forgot to ice it,btohqsg
I personally wouldn't BUT if it hurts too bad pls do,btohqsg
my lil bro fucking punched me,btohqsg
Punch him harder until he can‚Äôt cry,btohqsg
Don't leave it there in the open man,btohqsg
Because it can get some infections,btohqsg
like i press it‚Äôs only like a 2/10 pain,btohqsg
it‚Äôs the size of 4 50 cent coins,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very serious but if you want to err on the side of caution see a doctor,btohqsg
This will probably resolve on its own,btohqsg
Like it‚Äôs just blood vessels near the surface of the skin that broke,btohqsg
i think i just bruise v easily la,btohqsg
i punched him back and he didn‚Äôt bruise,btohqsg
that time he grabbed my arm damn tight,btohqsg
okie ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏ètq i thought i was gonna die,btohqsg
There might be some underlying condition then  in which case you might want to get it checked out,btohqsg
DOESNT THAT JUST MEAN I HAVE FAIR SKIN,btohqsg
Maybe need to see a dermatologist but see a GP/polyclinic first and get referral,btohqsg
I mean if it‚Äôs not the first time it might be a cause for concern,btohqsg
i thought i was just fair,btohqsg
Yikes btw how you doing these days,btohqsg
tryna work without SHIT MEN SURROUNDING ME,btohqsg
Since you in SAF just ck as much as you can at least you don‚Äôt have MC restriction unlike scdf,btohqsg
and he punched me so hard like,btohqsg
Damn elder sis doing parenting and lil bro decides that not the life he wants,btohqsg
But in SAF when you hit 30 days nothing happens tho right,btohqsg
i‚Äôm just afraid he grows up and does this to others,btohqsg
Society will teach him it's alright,btohqsg
I love kengijg and I want to stretch myself. I want to expand my keng ability and play bastard with my superiors so I can make my life easier and better. And most of all  I want to use my mc to simply go out or sleep at home to enjoy my ns benefits and to inspire other ckws to ck.Being a ckw is still shunned upon by many so I want to shine that light and let other ckws know that ck is okay.,btohqsg
Just ask for 5 day MC,btohqsg
u shld break it next time/s,btohqsg
Kinds feel sad for you sia  your life+ men not going well at all first your love then now your bro haiz,btohqsg
i think my mom will kill me,btohqsg
I just use public transport as much as possible,btohqsg
i just concerned over the bruise,btohqsg
cos i never seen so dark red before,btohqsg
previously it was blue then yellow,btohqsg
Ya can understand. When your brother annoys you it‚Äôs ok  but when you retaliate he plays victim and tries to curry sympathy,btohqsg
Reminds me of that Arthur‚Äôs fist scene lol,btohqsg
Sometimes you gotta vent it all out and throw one big punch,btohqsg
WHO TAUGHT HIM TO BE SUCH A PROFESSIONAL GASLIGHTER,btohqsg
I still can't believe the wrong no. assalamualaikum me,btohqsg
i still wonder who tf is it,btohqsg
wait am i rude to ask this?,btohqsg
Nah bruh thought he would think I'm a scam caller üòÇ,btohqsg
and u rso how many times,btohqsg
No worries  any day. Hope your blue black heals in days,btohqsg
The whole point of kenging is to get me leisure/rest time,btohqsg
You have to create your own valuation of that,btohqsg
oh not camp to clinic ah,btohqsg
If let‚Äôs say one extra day of leisure is worth $20 for me  but the cost is forfeiting $8 of meal allowance  I‚Äôll take the MC lol,btohqsg
then go doctor lose like $50,btohqsg
But the marginal benefit of kenging each additional day would get less and after a certain point there‚Äôs marginal costs such as forfeiting my promotion and hence potential allowance,btohqsg
How do you not know govt healthcare is free for NSFs,btohqsg
hence msc shifts towards the left,btohqsg
It doesn‚Äôt shift. It‚Äôs just that the gradient is not constant or 0,btohqsg
Since I‚Äôm so boliao maybe I should come up with a cost benefit graph for each additional day of kenging,btohqsg
Mana Doctor is like $10-$20 and you can claim back. Don't even need go polyclinic,btohqsg
Sleep play phone and if you‚Äôre adventurous go out and hope you don‚Äôt get caught,btohqsg
And if you retaking As more time to study,btohqsg
Oh ya under $20 can claim full cost,btohqsg
wait can retake As while going ns?,btohqsg
It rly depends on what vocation,btohqsg
At least don‚Äôt have to wake up early,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also a light sleeper so can‚Äôt sleep in the office,btohqsg
At home it‚Äôs much more comfortable,btohqsg
I thought his results are decent,btohqsg
Anyway I‚Äôve sort of planned when and how to take mc so that I don‚Äôt hit 30 days or affect my promotion,btohqsg
The c & k in clerks stands for chao keng,btohqsg
u everytime say penta u penta u,btohqsg
but how he can help so much with chem one?,btohqsg
the fuzzy pillow or the doob guy,btohqsg
‚ÄúFool me once  shame on - shame on you. Fool me tw- you can‚Äôt fool me again.‚Äù ~ George W Bush,btohqsg
In case anyone‚Äôs at Vivo today:https://www.instagram.com/p/C4-SxS0to1X/?igsh=MWhxb3A1ZDV4cTV2bA==,btohqsg

west plaza got 1  elias mall got 1  white sands got 1  dte got 1  loyang point got 1  upcoming pasir ris mall also will have 1,btohqsg
how far is it from the mrt station,btohqsg
white sand pasir ris mall  dte  sports complex,btohqsg
Coney island distance  pasir ris north,btohqsg

no as in this all like walking distance of each other,btohqsg
Oh wait nvm you mentioned Loyang alr my eyes got prob,btohqsg
the pasir ris mall is right next to white sands  the empty grass field last time,btohqsg
i had an exact same level of bruising on my thigh. it‚Äôll go away after a while but you might still feel a bit of pain afterwards if you press on it,btohqsg
It was also because that area got hit by something?,btohqsg
one at white sands  one at dte,btohqsg
How did i take 50min to buy foodüíÄ,btohqsg
Oh ok at least I guess it‚Äôs nothing very serious then. Probably bruising is normal if the impact is really hard but thankfully it‚Äôs just localised at that area,btohqsg
how did u fall down the stairs,btohqsg
Loosing track of time be like,btohqsg
yest my lemon chicken rice frm mr chicken rice came w/o any sauce,btohqsg
then my thigh slammed into the edge of the stairs,btohqsg
I always lose track of time when comes to errants / foodü•≤,btohqsg
Speaking of stairs  i hv phobia w steps coz i scared of falling down‚Ä¶so i either hold the railing or bend forward,btohqsg
Or find some way of securization,btohqsg
hold railing good  i also do that,btohqsg
eh who tf posted this own up now,btohqsg
idk how ppl go up/down the stairs without looking at the stairs,btohqsg
But i will still scared of tripping,btohqsg
idk  ltr i trip and roll down the stairs,btohqsg
Yea better be safe than sorry,btohqsg
1. It's not a mental issue,btohqsg
But sometimes when i look down and walk i will end up getting giddy instead,btohqsg
Nah those that walk and talk to their friends,btohqsg
Then next thing you know they bang into someone walking down,btohqsg
Bruh sometimes I walk down stairs I also mistep,btohqsg
Then realise I slid down to the 2nd step,btohqsg
wow first theyre not gangsters  now they're not rapists,btohqsg
Ok  but js curious about taste,btohqsg
did i say they're not rapists??,btohqsg
what i do for that response broüò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Looks like the mods removed the post,btohqsg
"Bruh why every 3 post there's a ""I'm lonely' post on sgexams",btohqsg
Most prob  you can't just say all these without evidence.,btohqsg
You can prevent any rape  just say yes.,btohqsg
we are not gangsters we are acs boys moment,btohqsg
my acsi friend said one of the girls was the fucking principals daughter,btohqsg
bluffed into the stone cold nuts,btohqsg
last sentence soundin a lil dismissive tbh,btohqsg
we are notgangstersrapists  we are acs boys moment,btohqsg
today the ppl behind were playing poker,btohqsg
And a new organisation gonna be setup to handle sexual crimes,btohqsg
hmm my pri sch cher apparently watchedchild porn,btohqsg
he went jail then come out alr,btohqsg
I mean it's a quote from a comedian but it is a great commentary of our current situation,btohqsg
I think this shows more of your character and ideals than mine.,btohqsg
He did not go jail then,btohqsg
You don't go jail and come out  he likely went rehabilitation,btohqsg
actual pedos tend to want to work at child centered places,btohqsg
ngl idk what the police is doing abt rape cases,btohqsg
My sch had a pretty famous casr,btohqsg
see this is why i fucking hate false rape accusers like mine,btohqsg
the teacher was called down in 2018,btohqsg
actly he was one of the nicest cher,btohqsg
until now is not settled yet,btohqsg
Hes still not charged and roaming free,btohqsg
my first reaction when i see this is how many of them r fucking cap and how many of them r legit,btohqsg
I thought family members cases would be higher,btohqsg
which is ass to the actual victims,btohqsg
what even was this match üíÄ,btohqsg
i ran into the teacher recently,btohqsg
Because on the outlook of the world  only 10% of actual perps of these crimes are committed by strangers a overwhelming majority are committed by family members or friends,btohqsg
but yea the moves a bit üíÄ,btohqsg
Dw he ain't going far  he is tagged by interpol,btohqsg
pein my chem cher always dam stingy with giving ws for revision lol,btohqsg
he used to tell us jokes in class  who knew he was doing this kind of thing secretly,btohqsg
This redditor sums up why his sentence was so light,btohqsg
u actly went to dig for it,btohqsg
That was never proven in court so there's that,btohqsg
You able to describe what he did?,btohqsg
No cuz I know it was just a case,btohqsg
Someone sent the link to his court hearing in our class grp chat,btohqsg
Q funny tho I rmbr he got interrogated in end 2018 then in 2019 he went Japan with his girlfriend,btohqsg
I guess it‚Äôs innocent till proven guilty and moe didn‚Äôt see any concrete evidence  so they never suspend him yet,btohqsg
I kind of want to see it,btohqsg
So he's just working outside I think,btohqsg
Ik he started his own business in 2019,btohqsg
Oh lol I thought you meant you ran into him in sch,btohqsg
A stingy teacher just wanting to get their end month salary...no surprise,btohqsg
The cops have a backlog of cases and they are not able to address every case in sufficient time,btohqsg
i wldnt say shes like that bad  just always dont give alot of practice material,btohqsg
Tbf its probably not serious enough,btohqsg
I think from the most recent article I read abt that case,btohqsg
They have to prioritize  for every case of a indecent exposure  there is one that is a serial one. For every sexual deviant  there is a serial one.They have to piriotise many factors including likelihood of bring caught vs harm to society over time,btohqsg
Isnt this why they don't do anything abt all the drug abuse cases,btohqsg
I think I talked to my fren abt it before they said it's not major enough to care abt,btohqsg
Many personel that have been involved in the industry of handling sexual crimes etc have noted. Most that do end up getting charged are not one time wonders  they are serial offendersThe one time wonders are given counselling and rehabilitation,btohqsg
Yep cause as we speak  there are about 2 or 3 drug kingpins in sg,btohqsg
üò∞ A girl  12  was hit by a car at a zebra crossing near a Bukit Batok school.This was despite a traffic warden signalling at the car to slow down.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/4aHdd9iFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
The girl ran across the road,btohqsg
And the small everyday dosage from the regular civilian will never ever do as much harm as these drug kingpins,btohqsg
I like my woman like I like my wine  12 years old and locked in a basement.,btohqsg
the punggol 2007 murder case i think havent fully reslove yet,btohqsg
Isn't there a rule in driver Ed where the moment a person enters the crosswalk  they have the right of way and the moment they do anything you do that fails to stop their safe passage through is your fault as a driver,btohqsg
I think she just assumed the moment the traffic warden said can cross means can start crossing,btohqsg
But ya she shouldn‚Äôt have ran,btohqsg
I feel the girl is like abit stupid for running,btohqsg
Theres also the woodlands Mrt rape and murder of a Indonesian student,btohqsg
The car driver probably had less than 3 seconds to react,btohqsg
The driver idk can't rly 100% blame him,btohqsg
Idk if the car driver was going too fast tho if it‚Äôs a sch zone,btohqsg
Yesh but in this practical scenario the girl was still dumb for deciding to just RUN ACROSS THE ROAD,btohqsg
I mean many laws around the world not just in Singapore always pin more blame on drivers irregardless of what the pedestrian does,btohqsg
Some of them police also can‚Äôt resolve despite their efforts,btohqsg
Can verify that@doobyis a real human,btohqsg
In fact the Onions Amicus Brief says it best: The second reason‚Äîperhaps mildly more important‚Äîis that the phrase ‚Äúyou are dumb‚Äù capturesthe very heart of parody: tricking readers into believing that they‚Äôre seeing a serious rendering of some specific form‚Äîa pop song lyric  a newspaper article  apolice beat‚Äîand then allowing them to laugh at theirown gullibility when they realize that they‚Äôve fallenvictim to one of the oldest tricks in the history of rhetoric.,btohqsg
Not like the driver could react on time in this case. It seems like the moment the traffic warden decide to raise his stick she ran across the road,btohqsg
Warden could‚Äôve also just waited for cars to pass too,btohqsg
lol. Yay  I passed Captcha. My existential issues are gone! ü•≥,btohqsg
Yes but acc to ryan = 100% driver wrong,btohqsg
This is a kind of a,btohqsg

Maybe she just thinks passenger always right of way,btohqsg
I rmbr us saying sth like we have more faith in you than yourself,btohqsg
