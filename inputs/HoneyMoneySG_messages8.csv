How do i redeem cashback from citibank?,btohqsg
Where * is the last 4 digits of ur card. Denominations for withdraw is $10 - CSHBK10  $20 - CSHBK20 & $50 CSHBK50,btohqsg

Hahah market in a mess now,btohqsg
anyone kena stuck in Celsius ?,btohqsg
But this happened  today what not at the time he shared. Lol,btohqsg
Funny how you quote a 90% Hodlnaut content video just to prove your point.,btohqsg
And isn't investment a place that you need to do your due diligence and not enjoy the benefits and f the person if u are losing money?,btohqsg
I'm sure nobody expected Celsius to do a rug pull but as always  crypto is and always was a high risk play  more so than equities. Do NOT put more than what you could afford to lose.,btohqsg
In addition  I have also removed my CDC and Gemini codes. I'm keeping Hodlnaut and FTX for now,btohqsg
ownself put money in then dont blame others.,btohqsg
Always do your own research 🙂,btohqsg
CDC & Gemini also has issues now ?,btohqsg
They don't (for now). Just that companies with their own native coins don't really align with me,btohqsg
Feelsbad to be rug by Celsius,btohqsg
but FTX also has FTT ?,btohqsg
You still need FTX for the lowest cost crypto exchange  buy/transfer USD/USDC,btohqsg
Yeah .but confirmed a rug ?,btohqsg
First it was Luna terra  now is Celsius  next is Hodlnaut?,btohqsg
if FUD and everyone pull out  can be,btohqsg
tonight it's going to be tough...another day of market crash,btohqsg
maybe for now SSB is better,btohqsg

The current free GrabPay top-up limit of $500 monthly for JiPay will be reduced to $250 per month  per card. Additional top-ups will be subjected to 2.5% service fee.,btohqsg
effective from 1 July 2022 00:00 UTC,btohqsg
just received from jipay email 😢😢,btohqsg
Uh there was  top up limit ?,btohqsg
No limit but 2.5% fee after $500 previously,btohqsg
I didn't see the fee :o,btohqsg
Even if top up with uob absolute card?? Also have fee?,btohqsg
I thought that was what has been recommended to top up grab then pay insurance premiums via axs app?,btohqsg
You are mixing up two different matters,btohqsg
Will appear on the top-up page when you ty to exceed $500 top-up,btohqsg
A lot of exclusion too. Like airasia food delivery and pickupp not in the cashback.,btohqsg
It's difficult to use because it works on whitelist rather than blacklist. But I will share something about it tonight,btohqsg
*prior to this $250 topup nerf*,btohqsg
1st July so still can do 1 more top up,btohqsg
Not the same  refer to my Jipay video,btohqsg
Let me know if you can transfer USD. No option for me to transfer USD. I can only transfer SGD from DBS MCA to Syfe trade HSBC account. Syfe app will show you have deposited USD instead of SGD. The spread is more than the usual SGD transfer.,btohqsg
can but have dbs mca fee and also hsbc fee.,btohqsg
its weird dbs mca if transfer usd to usd account of international bank is free but to usd account of singapore bank have charge,btohqsg
To which international bank is free?,btohqsg

Tested jipay  paying singtel  some grocery and train rides  only train rides track 1.5% cashback... is telecom payment excluded from the cashback list?,btohqsg
Telecom doesn’t award Cashback but if u use grab to top up JiPay u have gotten it already.,btohqsg
Ok  thank you. Maybe will pay telecom directly from grabpay next time since jipay will reduce max top up using grabpay next month onwards.,btohqsg
Hi guys So far  from your usage  what's the transactions that have given 1.5% cashback besides simplygo public transport? The description in website is quite confusing. Not sure purchase in places like ntuc  guardian will qualify or not.,btohqsg
Is there anyway to view the Jipay card number before card arrival?,btohqsg
so far i used for food and shopee/lazada  all got 1.5%. Top up kopitiam card no 1.5%,btohqsg
Food as in food court  coffee shop  any restaurants? So far  I've gotten cashback from simplygo rides and topping up ezlink app,btohqsg

Can try pay through cardup/ ipaymy?,btohqsg
The transaction fees for those is more than the cashback itself. Haha not very feasible,btohqsg
My impression is they sometimes will run promos which will cut down the transaction fees,btohqsg

PSA: To be transparent  I have also moved my 99% of my USDC from Hodlnaut to FTX Blockfolio due to the current Crypto landscape. I am doing this as a de-risking move.This are no bad news of Hodlnaut (for now). In fact I think out of all lending platforms  they are still the most transparent and forthcoming one to respond to customer queries. I'm just being conservative for now.You can read JT's (Hodlnaut Co-founder) tweet here to clarify Hodlnaut operationshttps://twitter.com/jt_hodlnaut/status/1538574587813801984?s=20&t=kHhNL6lXsmddkWF7C2yA6w,btohqsg

Hello everyone  anyone know is all Apple/Netflix/Spotify/YouTube subscription consider as others category or online payment for credit card? I refer for UOB EVOL  DBS live fresh and OCBC frank card.,btohqsg
Hi guys never had a credit card before but was interested in credit card churning. Just watched honey money video about it. If anyone can share their experience or tips on it I would appreciate it,btohqsg
1. Apply for credit card with promo2. Spend minimum amt required to achieve promo3. Apply for another credit card with promo (and start from step 1 for the new card)4. Wait for the promo from the 1st card to be credited5. Check with bank if there is any minimum period to hold the card if not the promo will be clawed back.6. Once period is up  cancel card.7. Once the duration of 9-12 mnths is over (depends on the bank) from the date you cancelled your card  apply for a new card from that bank with promo8. Profit.,btohqsg
Apparently now a lot of card requires you to not cancel 12 months how do you go around that? And also can we apply multiple cards every month? Then just cancel after the 12 month,btohqsg
I think some people try to imitate him. Just beware,btohqsg
Most impt thing is to pay bills IN FULL and ON TIME. This shd easily maintain credit score at AA even if you have multiple lines of credit,btohqsg
I am just holding the cards for 12 mnths  and why would you want to apply multiple cards per mnth? Just use 1 card per mnth to make sure you hit the minimum  don't overspend,btohqsg
I'll let others comment on credit card churning. I got too much flak for talking about it online,btohqsg
"Yes  don't trust anyone that just says ""Hello"" to you and ask you to join crypto & investment scams",btohqsg
Yeah was thinking of using the one card and hitting the gift rewards and get another card from another bank and do the same in another month. Yes credit card churning for the rewards,btohqsg
Just go read the comments in my credit card churning video,btohqsg
Just read it mostly people are concern about their credit score. Anyway how do you guys buy groceries vouchers? Do they have an expiry date on it?,btohqsg
I am in my 2nd year of doing it alr  as Chris said in his video  this is all factored in the bank's customer acquisition costs. On your end  if you pay your bills in full on time and maintain a good credit score  banks will continue to issue you credit cards no problem.,btohqsg
So what’s the best one? Most people already have most bank’s  credit cards,btohqsg
Just received my samsonite with maybank cc,btohqsg

Hi Chris. Personally I have tried using ezlink Mastercard via Google pay it went through.  Just FYI.,btohqsg
How long till Jipay's cashback get tracked? Transferred from jipay to ezlink mastercard  havent received any news yet,btohqsg
in my experience  the JiPay will show there is 1.5% cashback green color font indication immediately  but the real cash will be credited on the first day of the following month,btohqsg
Show 1.5% in recent transactions issit?,btohqsg
It shows the top ups  but didnt show the $500 that I used to top up my ezlink wallet  but the $500 is is alr in my ezlink,btohqsg
Did I top up my ezlink wrongly? Hahaha,btohqsg
"I think ""Top-up"" mentioned above is to add to your JiPay balance  not to the EzLink",btohqsg
Yea but my jipay balance $0 already because I transferred to ezlink,btohqsg
Is it correct to link the jipay card in this page and transfer the $ to ezlink here?,btohqsg
Any reason why the $500 + cashback not showing up on this page?,btohqsg
You shall be able to see the historical top up,btohqsg
not sure why. Have you reached the 30$ cashback cap?,btohqsg
Yes the $ is in my ezlink  I just got my card yesterday and tried out today  this is my first transaction using jipay,btohqsg
Just saw this at sheng siong and signed up. Posting here for people who are interested about it,btohqsg
Did lots of people use diner club card?,btohqsg
FYI  BOC Sheng Siong card is 6% rebate at Sheng Siong  1.5% for all other spend  no min spend. And its Visa aka way more accepted.,btohqsg
Dayum should have tot about that,btohqsg
But is it for all spending ?,btohqsg
Look like better deal. Just no sheng siong around my place.,btohqsg
1.5% for all other spending  but the usual exclusions apply  aka no ins premium etc.,btohqsg
6% is for all spending at Sheng Siong,btohqsg
BOC sheng siong card is it good base on your experience ?,btohqsg
I only really use it at Sheng Siong hahah cause now stacking on Jipay,btohqsg
But the application was a pain  the BOC website screwed up one  I ended up snail mailing in my card application,btohqsg
what are the benefits or cashback for ezlink pay?,btohqsg
The benefit is that ezlink is supposedly an eligble merchant for the 1.5% cashback from jipay as you can see from@nickyshscreenshots aboveMy question is  i did not get the 1.5% cashback and afaik  I did all the steps correctly  anyone knows why? Do I need to contact jipay support?,btohqsg
yup I went there to top up  sent all my screenshots above,btohqsg
no other cards linked to my ezlink wallet yet so I won't top up wrongly,btohqsg

Ok  IT support fixed it  there was something wrong in the system  I didnt mention ezlink app,btohqsg

Hello can i check for the EZLink 5+5 promo  i managed to get the $5 during sign up. But I didnt get the other $5 for spending $10 by using SGQR for hawker food. Any idea? is it need to transact through their Mastercard?,btohqsg
My $5 for the spending took a couple of days to show up in the ezlink wallet  so dont panic just yet hahah,btohqsg
Same here i think only cold storage can,btohqsg
For webull my 1st deposit it's not 2k .But still under the 30 days isit still valid. ?Can I deposit 2k now and proced,btohqsg
is it only after 30days than we will see the voucher?,btohqsg

For the revolut card if i were to top up $200 and then withdraw money from it.Will i be still eligible for the 20% bus/mrt cashback even though it is <$200 by the end of the calendar month?,btohqsg
Annual fees payable hard to quantify,btohqsg
Don't look too attractive to the mass audience for the high fees  after I read Milelions review too,btohqsg
But if you are in the miles camp with $120 000 annual income and need to get miles for purchase  it can be of good value too  considering you also get a free hotel night + 10 airport lounge passes,btohqsg
Anyone hitting error while adding jipay as  payment method in ezlink ewallet ?,btohqsg
Maybe wait a while before u try again.,btohqsg
Sorry anyone signed up for the fastest finger flash deal? How to know if one of the 1st 5 submissions?,btohqsg

I exited all my crypto position to stablecoin after crypto announce straight away. Did not stake. Lucky,btohqsg
Lucky i only stake 500 only,btohqsg
Then don't have cashback. I tot now change to jade green then have cashback,btohqsg
Really ? I didnt use the card often tho,btohqsg
Now the red card basically useless,btohqsg
So basically it don't work. Your method. Don't even need to try. Unless you have icy white and above.,btohqsg
And if you stake CRO. 捡芝麻丢西瓜。 Now cro is crashing,btohqsg
My chinese no good what does that mean ?,btohqsg
Welp no choice since it lock inside. Will do my hw next time round.,btohqsg
My friend even worse than me he put 5000 for the other card,btohqsg
Icy white and the black card worse.,btohqsg
What I said about flauntingCrypto.comCRO benefits at the start of 2022,btohqsg
I enter early. $0.08 to $0.20. Then unstake and exit. Now keep the card as free lounge access. Probably too early though when it rises to $0.90+.,btohqsg
crypto generally still considered volatile high risk asset . this market downturn is like a test  that it is not rly a good hedge against the current market conditions. Still a zero sum game to many rather than a stored of value .,btohqsg
Hi  since we can UOB absolute cashback -> Grabpay -> Jipay -> Ezlink wallet  can we also use the ezlink mastercard to make insurance payment on AXS?,btohqsg

Anyone knows if Revolut transport Cashback got extended?,btohqsg
I’m actually curious if we intend to spend $100 in msia every month. Is it better to change SG>RM in Singapore  in Msia  or withdraw using revolut?,btohqsg
If you just use the combo of AMEX and  GrabPay  that means 300 * 2.9% = 8.7 SGD  while the Revolut cashback is capped at 10 SGD,btohqsg
The extra gain is really petty and not worthwhile,btohqsg
If we use grab card to top up will we be eligible for the 20%? Grab card is a debit card right?,btohqsg
Look at it another way... use revolut for your 1st $50 worth of rides  and use the rest using amex/grab combi,btohqsg
Debit card top up was excluded at least once in the past,btohqsg
Ya but for this case  not sure if a top up from grab will work,btohqsg
Would withdraw by revolut for me,btohqsg
Grabpay top up should now work since they allow debit card top up from July onwards for the 10sgd cashback. Compared to June  it was only bank transfer,btohqsg
Because going msia so common now. Was thinking which method actual save more money,btohqsg
Can use amex topup grab? Have 20percent cashback?,btohqsg
Bank top up to be safe  but you can try,btohqsg
But you won’t know until august when you receive your cashback,btohqsg

I've 2 cpf contribution a monthSo I decided to TRF in one of it monthly to my SA .I've a sum in my OA that I wanna trf to my SA shall I do it after the bonus or it's ok to do it now.,btohqsg
No difference for transfers  since interest is just calculated based on lowest amount of the month,btohqsg
Maybe to put more in perspective:1) If SA > FRS  FRS amount will be parked into RA for CPF Life. Thereafter  any access in SA and OA can be withdrawn respective order.2) If SA < FRS  whatever is in SA will be moved to RA followed by balance amount from OA to RA in order to fulfill the FRS to parked into RA for CPF Life.3) The instant ATM will be withdrawn from SA first and then followed by OA. Unless u fulfilled point 1) and done ur shielding,btohqsg

Hello broYou the owner of this telegram group?,btohqsg
Sorry in advance if this isnt allowed. Please delete if its inappropriate.1) For those who are poor like me and unable to get credit card  you can used standard chartered jumpstart card. I have tried it and it work i get my 1 percent cash back. So far got 7 dollars.2) this might result your account in getting banI realize that instarem can be used to top up your grab a while back. So i tried this  not sure if its against tos or not. But i tried to do it and i was able to withdraw the money out of ezlink card and put it on grab to earn twice as much point.Update i think amaze ban me because i do that. I am able to do it to ezlink master card tho.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. Anyone else tried this?,btohqsg
Another alternative to the standard charter jumpstart card that i have would be the safra card so far i havent tried it yet. Will update once tried,btohqsg
Wouldnt recommend part 2 tho because its against the security policy,btohqsg
Paiseh forgot to add that that one is a substitute for the method where you use grab to top up jipay to top up the ezlink card,btohqsg
Since i do not have the credit card this is the next best thing,btohqsg
Hello can check with you guys pls. I want to buy a overseas product from online website which is on usd. The product cost ard usd$680 (~sgd$1100). Is citi SMRT the best card to use for the 5% rebate? Or use others like revolut (convert sgd to usd)?,btohqsg
Or any other better methods u guy will recommend?,btohqsg
Does anyone know if the UOB absolute card fixed deposit collateral earns interest? And for CC in general if I have to post a collateral does it usually earn interest?,btohqsg

Btw revolut card is considered credit card?,btohqsg

Hi anyone recently signed up for jipay? Have this popup upon signing up and dont have a spender to add as I'm using it for myself. Any idea how to ensure they issue out my first card?,btohqsg
Just make a top up  like what it said,btohqsg
I also initially thought so but the wordings are unclear. So I asked jipay which seem to state that both spender and top-up must be done before card issuance,btohqsg
In short just top up $25 and wait for a week.,btohqsg
Hi  just wanted to clarify. Signing up for a credit card if I have an existing debit card with the bank will still allow me to be eligible for the credit card promos yes?,btohqsg
What kind of promo and whic credit card? Only citibank has rewards for existing customers for now,btohqsg
Sorry  didn't make myself clear. Currently holding UOB debit card. So intending to sign up for a UOB credit card. I know that promos are usually for new to bank sign ups. Debit cards don't count against that right?,btohqsg
Correct. Still a new user if you're just holding debit card with no credit card before,btohqsg
Uob promotion didn’t mentioned for ppv card if they received 12000 miles only mentioned $150 cash. Anyone has any information to that?,btohqsg

For me   my issue with ezlink wallet is that sometime/most of the time I will receive an error message. But the wallet will update within hours.,btohqsg
So its is jipay side problem or ezlink side problem?,btohqsg
I seeI tot ezlink wouldnt be an issue since they are a bigger company,btohqsg
Because got people using Grab also having the same issue.,btohqsg
Big company does not mean efficiency. Since they have basically no much business in app wallet. They mainly focus on bus/mrt payment system.,btohqsg

You trip can transfer to revoult ?,btohqsg
Hmmm… I just perform a transaction for USD48 earlier on amaze  was SGD67.71  YouTrip would’ve been SGD67.28,btohqsg
Wah bro thank you so much was smooth,btohqsg
Lucky we have grab or jipay to the rescue. So the money wont stuck at youtrip,btohqsg
True my you trip got $1 I dunno how to take out ardy.I lost my u trip card also..,btohqsg
I just replaced my youtrip card cause expire. they still will keep the value for you.,btohqsg
"I intend to bring youtrip & revolut if i ever go oversea. cause revolut has bigger ""spread"" on weekends. So youtrip as backup",btohqsg
Jipay doesnt seem to work for the withdraw for some reason,btohqsg
then use grab to top up jipay $250. now i regret. haha,btohqsg
I from ji pay transfer to revoult than bank .,btohqsg
Ok i am not the smartest knife in the crayon box,btohqsg
I was transfering 100.50 because i forgot i withdraw too much time,btohqsg
It’s okay. Don’t need to be the smartest. We all make mistakes,btohqsg
but will get 20% cashback? Or you try try first?,btohqsg
No la bro I just try for the ns100 money.I'm not doing the 20%,btohqsg
my friend just tried  Grab cannot,btohqsg
Jipay is still small i think they wont caught on so quick,btohqsg
so it looks like the receiving app need to create a QR code that indicate specific amount. Good thing Chris introduced Jipay for us earlier.,btohqsg
I rmb youtrip you need to key in the specific amount first before generate the QR. maybe that is the way,btohqsg
Yea we are lucky to know about this jipay  i dont see big sg financial youtuber talking about it.,btohqsg
I passed my jipay card to my mum to pay for some grocery at supermarkets. But all like no cashback. The only time I had cash back is when register with grab it record my $1 for testing and also Unity by fairprice.,btohqsg

Just curious  I do have AMEX TCB. Should I sign up for UOB Absolute now which gives you $150 cashback for the first $3000 you spend? been looking out for any singsaver or moneysmart new sign up bonus. But seeing how UOB nerf their UOB one. I don't think they are going to release newer promotion soon?,btohqsg
how to transfer from jipay to revolut?,btohqsg
Moneysmart used to give $50 for simply just signing up  with no min spend.Your choice whether to wait for it again.,btohqsg
If u are keen in the $150 cashback why not consider other UOB card where u can get by spending 1.5k instead of 3k. Then the other 1.5k u can clock somewhere else. Just a suggestion 😊,btohqsg
I have irregular spending every month  can't even hit $500 consistently. That's why,btohqsg
Haha then dun spend for the sake of spending 150/3000 is 5% not much,btohqsg
UOB absolute can use to top up grab and withdraw back to bank. So it's not wasting money,btohqsg
I didn’t know that thanks for sharing,btohqsg
AMEX TCB and UOB Absolute are the only 2 cards that can get cashback for grab top up,btohqsg
I mean I’m not aware on the part withdraw back to bank,btohqsg
AMEX TCB is 1.5% Absolute is 1.7%,btohqsg
Unless u wanna do churning then time the 2 cards,btohqsg
I came to know this channel because of credit card churning.,btohqsg
Can share about the withdraw back to bank?,btohqsg
In your grab app click Finance tab at the bottom  click transfer and choose your paynow account if you have that set up.,btohqsg
Last time i did a longer method to prevent looking sus. Which is to transfer money from grab to revolut  then transfer back to back. I have revolut card because I also using CDC card  last time they were saying if using grab to top up CDC got fee  So i got revolut card just for that. But now we can use grab to top up CDC  donno what to do with revolut,btohqsg
Probably just to earn the 20% public transport capped at 10% every month? And use it together with Youtrip when going overseas.,btohqsg
Now still got 20% cashback for public transport ?,btohqsg
I see I think it ok for me I use amex this year then the next year UOB for tax,btohqsg
Yes  but now they changed the T&C  need to top up $300 via bank transfer orcard?,btohqsg
correct me if im wrong but im pretty sure you cant withdraw funds from grab that are topped up with credit cards. Only debit card/funds funded from bank can be withdrawn,btohqsg
if a person is not NTB but don’t have SCB Credit card in the past 2 years  still can get $300?,btohqsg
Yes  a new to bank means you dont hold or cancel any SC card within 12 months,btohqsg

One of my friend tried grab  cannot. I would like to guess use something like Youtrip or Jipay where the app will generate a QR code with the value $100 and save it in your photo galley. Then open the lifeSG app and scan that same QR code,btohqsg
So the best method for ns55 is topup jipay?,btohqsg
I guess so. I transfer back to grab liao,btohqsg
Ok. I guess it is best. Can use ns55 to topup jipay. Then use jipay paynow back to own bank account. This way is best. Written here so others can see on how to redeem easier.,btohqsg
Managed to transfer to Jipay. But keep clicking upload Qr code  the picture doesn’t load in 😢,btohqsg
Do i have to wait until the card arrives before it can be used to pay?,btohqsg

Are you sure that is possible?,btohqsg
UOB absolute is always like that because it’s AMEX. They mention in their website can use to top up wallet. And there no exclusion in the T&C,btohqsg
I think there's a spend $3000 to get 5%.,btohqsg
No sign up bonus. Only UOB own 5% for first $3000.,btohqsg
I don’t think any credit card allow you to withdraw cash and count it as eligible spending. I strongly encourage you to watch honey money or other YouTubers about credit card first.,btohqsg
