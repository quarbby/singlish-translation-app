Hi there  wanted to hear if anyone has upgraded their careshield plans with Great Eastern - what is your view on using GE and how much do you think it necessary for the coverage?,btohqsg
So far I do know of hsbc & citi not sure of the rest,btohqsg
They do stand out as the only insurer which pays one ADL upon diagnosis. Please check with independent FA who can advise and tell you the difference across the insurers that offer careshield life supplement plans. One has own preference to the plans in long term outlook and FA can do the fact find for you,btohqsg

Hi all  wld like to ask. Dbs altitude card does not hv expiry on miles while the UOB lady card has a 2 yr expiry for the accumulated miles. Wld the $4 per mile still make sense if we pair it with Cardup for income tax and insurance payment ?,btohqsg
4miles per dollar u mean? there is no 4miles per dollar for cardup,btohqsg
the base rewards for ladys card is 0.4mpd  the bonus amt is 3.6mpd,btohqsg
hence nobody uses ladys card for cardup expenses  usually pairing it up with general spending cards like UOB Privimiles,btohqsg
Pocket mode is not working üòÇ,btohqsg

yeah okkk Thanks a lot ü•∞,btohqsg
Noted with thanks. I am still trying to understand which is better. If I am making a single payment for insurance 100k within next 2 weeks  my qns is:1. At 2.25% for Cardup  wld it be better to pair up DBS altitude card or UOB Privi?Any expiry to above?,btohqsg
Hi experts  am I still in time to participate in the rising dragon promo ending 30 March? Thanks,btohqsg
So is this UOB lady card better to pair up with Instarem Amaze for overseas spending? Thank you for helping  A bit confused :),btohqsg
short answer is yes but depending on which category u have chosen for the quarter,btohqsg
Yes. Just remember to calculate your aggregated funds based on 30 Dec  1030pm.,btohqsg
a better option wld be to get 2 diff cards and link it to amaze if u are projecting your spending to exceed the cap on the ladys card,btohqsg
Ok noted   good idea to link to 2 cards. Amaze instarem is good to link up mainly for overseas spending   correct?,btohqsg
yes or locally if u need to convert your expenditure to online spending to fufill the criteria,btohqsg
Ok well noted  Robinn. Thank you very much!,btohqsg
Anyone has answer for below?If I am making a single payment for insurance 100k within next 2 weeks:1. At 2.25% for Cardup  wld it be better to pair up DBS altitude card or UOB Privi?2. Any expiry to above card to convert the miles?,btohqsg
Hi Mervyn  my mthly avg balance for Dec 23 show 99k on the website. Does it mean only amount beyond 99k will qualify for the dragon promo? Thank you for your advice!,btohqsg
Should I just empty my account end of this month and hope for another rising dragon promo in April?,btohqsg
Not monthly average balance. Your end of day balance on 30 Dec 23  1030pm.,btohqsg
In order to still get interest for March  when is the earliest I can empty the account please?,btohqsg
if 30 Dec you have 100k in account then the promotion does not really helps unless you have another 100k to spare.,btohqsg
I would say UOB Privi is better as it earns u 1.4mpd compared with Altitude's 1.3mpd. May be significant to u so not sure abt thatUOB UNI$ expiry is 2years while DBS i believe has no expiry. UOB cost $25 to transfer points to your KF membership while DBS costs $27. So they are quite similar depending on how u look at it,btohqsg
I run in Indian Stock Market Looking forward to invest in HK market as wellI will be in HK in AprilAnyone want exchange knowledge? ü§ù‚ô•Ô∏è,btohqsg
They look at end balance on 30-Dec 10pm for this promotion. If you didnt empty out on 30-Dec then it may not benefit in participating now.,btohqsg
Interest is calculated based on MAB  Not last day of withdrawal.To maximize the interest  your Mar MAB shall be $100k. I.e. total end day balance on Mar = $3.1milIf you plan to withdraw on 28 Mar  6pm  your total end day balance from 01-27 Mar shall be $3.1milIf you plan to withdraw on 30 Mar  6pm  your total end day balance from 01-29 Mar shall be $3.1mil,btohqsg
For the moomoo financial advancement programme  i do not need to redeem all my funds and resubscribe right? It says it calculate all that i have in moomoo,btohqsg
Well noted. :) you are a pro!,btohqsg
for me i prefer UOB cards as they are generally better than what the other banks have to offer hence i prefer pool my points across with UOB,btohqsg
Oh ya..I forgot about pooling. So for the UOB Privi card  generally we hv transfer the miles within 2 yrs to airlines right  before it expires? Is that how it works?,btohqsg
Have you successfully managed to get fee waiver for the UOB Privi miles  Robin?,btohqsg
Sorry I‚Äôm confused. If I had 100k as of 31 Dec  can I still empty my account on 28 Mar and hope for rising dragon promo in apr?,btohqsg
^ cause I saw this too,btohqsg
Apr promo should be based on your acct balance on last day of Mar  not 31 Dec.,btohqsg
Dbs altitude give u 1.3 mpd  uob 1.4 mpd. Altitude no expiry  uob 2 year,btohqsg
I would like to promote something which is not related to bank cards/banks,btohqsg
Hi  i recently got a refund on my uob ladys credit card of $700. And my expense for the month of $300 for the uob one account monthly interest showed as 0 in the interest tracker,btohqsg
