No need to scold me what,btohqsg
i expect a large engine to have higher torque but it does not have,btohqsg
good sounding engine  more smiles per miles,btohqsg
i took it just now. it is intoxicating,btohqsg
i also tested the DCT. when i cruise it from 7th to come to a stop at toll station  it changes to 6th and then i rapidly slow down and it skips 5 and 4 and straight to 3 and then 2... nice,btohqsg
the mazda skyactiv is also smooth. transmission too. but it is slow changing,btohqsg
I mr@Cxspeedfanboy. Can own 2 m cars in Singapore. No easy feat,btohqsg
anyone can do. because i dont buy NEW,btohqsg
you guys and many here like to have new.,btohqsg
I think because people worried about maintenance,btohqsg
a japanese car like mazda is reliable. there are many good used cars out there.,btohqsg
find one with service history. dont be scared. be a man. do it,btohqsg
The joy of finding new problems ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°,btohqsg
Singapore mileage is generally Low on average compared with overseas,btohqsg
i think one guy followed my to buy a used one too.,btohqsg
cfm problems ä¸€å¤§å † (one big stack),btohqsg
Wait.. Megane rs 1.8 is NA..?,btohqsg
Yes. My friend Mazda 5 change gear is smoother then my DCT honda ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
No. He bring in turbo ðŸ˜‚X was comparing typre r and m3 torque.,btohqsg
Nothing beats the joy of calling the tow truck,btohqsg
And on first name basis with the tow truck uncle,btohqsg
subaru owner here who called me?,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/g42oP7hUVTMHonda GoldWing tow truck.So don't have to wait so long at express way,btohqsg
Gt63s 4matic using a 4.0 V8 as well now. 900nm torque,btohqsg
only one way to find out,btohqsg
Something a bit older  Ferrari 458 speciale with a 4.5l V8 with 540nm,btohqsg
Really about what age of car you're looking at and what it was designed for,btohqsg
W204 C63 6.2L V8 w 600nm,btohqsg
I know the sign for Maserati,btohqsg
And that's back in those days,btohqsg
i know  i like NA engine,btohqsg
no torque so can get smoked by everybody from 0-60,btohqsg
About same as m3â€™s 104. NA things,btohqsg
I love the over hung ups on torque numbers,btohqsg
They only tell but one side of an amazing driving experience and story around large CC NA cars like the 458  or w204 c63 or E9x m3,btohqsg
of course la. otherwise you can write off this engine maker,btohqsg
but the s65b40 v8 is lighter than ex- inline-6 engine,btohqsg
Lighter yet hp increase by more than 100hp over the last gen m3 as far as I have read,btohqsg
but many complain of reliability. like the infamous rod beartings and the failed plastic throttle actuator gears that melt! ðŸ˜±,btohqsg
that is why i dont really want to drive often,btohqsg
i think roughly 80 bhp increase,btohqsg
the e39 v8 has 390 bhp,btohqsg
You guys never go car meet yesterday and today?,btohqsg
yur volvo makes no emotive sound? modify it,btohqsg
As they say  thereâ€™s no replacement for displacement,btohqsg
torque = Force (Newton) x Distance (m). increase either or both to get bigger Torque. turbo = bigger force. longer stroke = bigger distance,btohqsg
but longer stroke means rpm got to be lower,btohqsg
Nah. Has yours failed on you so far? Anyway just preventively change them out then as theyâ€™re <$1k parts cost alone if it concerns you. The throttle actuators also the same and you can always change to the metal gear ones and they are probably in the range of $2k or less Iâ€™m guessing?,btohqsg
bores gives larger torque since force produced would be bigger,btohqsg
To max power per cylinder you would probably want to max rpm  and many powerful engines would typically have large bores and shorter strokes,btohqsg
