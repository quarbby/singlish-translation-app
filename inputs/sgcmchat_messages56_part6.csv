Who still wan buy used car,btohqsg
No offense if this person is here,btohqsg
gna try working retail next time,btohqsg
But q expected for a coe bmw,btohqsg
But he is quite stupidFirst test drive car see issues  still place deposit saying get the stuff fixed but never sign contractThen upon handover accept car transfer to his name even though repairs were not madeSome more go to media and tell them the inflated price that was mentioned on paper for full loan when the car actually costs much lesser,btohqsg
Why accept transfer of vehicle if it wasn't done up to your agreed terms?,btohqsg
There are still some great units out there regardless of age,btohqsg
Drive better than what they did out of factory as well,btohqsg
Like I said  if you know what you're doing  you can find great cars out there,btohqsg
It all boils down to how the owner drive what he done and alot of other things,btohqsg
You need to be able to figure that out in that short test drive  looking at the listing  PPI if you really decide to move forward with the unit,btohqsg
2nd hand dealers let u test drive meh,btohqsg
Lemon law doesn't help this guy,btohqsg
His engine hasn't seized up neither has his gearbox blown,btohqsg
He accepted the car in that condition upon handover,btohqsg
A very hard case to fight for him,btohqsg
Plus I doubt he would want to take it to court knowing he's on a full loan which is already against MAS lending rules,btohqsg
He probably wanted the badge ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Thought he could get it for cheap,btohqsg
Ok i think got ppl angry alr i shuddap,btohqsg
But first time buyer so not much knowledge on what to look for,btohqsg
Jn got ppl try mute me,btohqsg
It's just a generalization made thanks to the abundance of cheaply modified and poorly maintained cars on the market,btohqsg
I having chill talk w arnav,btohqsg
Then y ppl go for bmw?,btohqsg
There's some really bad condition w204s and CLAs out there too,btohqsg
Rwd  easier to make them look like an upkitted M car  bmw known to be better driver's car from the base levels,btohqsg
Yuppp most bigger brands need to go hybrid with the number of cars they produce to keep total emissions low,btohqsg
That's why you see cars from the 90s to 00s now heavily increasing in value,btohqsg
If you see cars from 2015+ with all the screens and stuff,btohqsg
All of them damn dated already,btohqsg
You see 2016 A class or CLA and see the current gen,btohqsg
And in turn these middle era cars will just tank and won't hold value as well as their older counterparts,btohqsg
Let's see what you think of it in the next 3 years,btohqsg
The CLA  gla  A  B  GLC  G  GLE  GLS screens all dated already,btohqsg
You see the new EQs  the new C and S,btohqsg
3 years later Mercedes will come in with another design,btohqsg
U need to turn ur head to look at the infortaintment,btohqsg
Last time cars could last how long? 10-15 years easily,btohqsg
Now getting to 10 years globally also hard,btohqsg
I preder the 2 screen layout,btohqsg
Still need to do that in the 2 screen layout,btohqsg
And why would you be looking at the infotainment when driving?,btohqsg
Nope u oni need to turn ur eyes abit,btohqsg
Once you start driving you see what the difference is,btohqsg
Theirs is still curved towards the driver,btohqsg
Bmw infotainment usually focussed towards the driver,btohqsg
U just said bmw drivers car,btohqsg
But dont u think the s63 grille,btohqsg
It the panamerica and like a charging port,btohqsg
