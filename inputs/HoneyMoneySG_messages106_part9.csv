Yeah  so I think this time is too fund $4200 to get $100.,btohqsg
Is topping up via absolute or true cashback card still valid? I know there was a nerf but not sure if it was for both cardsedit: ok nvm i think i remember now  they just removed AMEX from cc link.?,btohqsg
Sorry  I stand corrected. But then I don't know why they introduced this new mechanics then and emphasise need to complete one task then can start another. Only for the first task?,btohqsg

hey guys can i just check. heymax says you can get 4MPD at a bunch of places like 7-11 for eg. but from what i understand its only for online purchases right? for the WWMC,btohqsg
Heymax is not always right.I just paid for my Vodien with PPV following heymax and didn‚Äôt get 4mpd.CRMC gets 4mpd but heymax put 0.4mpd.I feel it‚Äôs only 80% accurate:,btohqsg
you paid online?Side note  highly recommend checking using instarem amaze method before any online spends (offline too if the situation allows),btohqsg
Guys and ladies. I want to clarify 1 thing. Due to hsbc nerb on fast food and supermarkets. Hsbc revolution card for ya kun  toast box. Do you still get 4 miles spend ?,btohqsg
It depends. Yakun can be 5812 or 5814  depending on branches. Safer to use another card.,btohqsg
Yes. Kinda lazy to do the amaze.But the info on heymax also not correct. I would have thought my CRMC won‚Äôt get 4mpd with MCC 7372Got confused because I check heymax (have been paying with crmc in past with 4mpd),btohqsg
How many credit card miles are worth paying transfer fee for? Assuming miles are not expiring  and the conversion fee is about $25. Would you redeem 25k miles  or wait until you accumulate significant amount (100k or so)?,btohqsg
if they are not expiring and you don't need to buy something immediately  then it makes sense to wait as long as you can,btohqsg
abit confused - lifestyle activity (e.g. Groceries) means if i spend on the linked card for groceries then $2 gets issued?,btohqsg
I usually wait till is is expiring,btohqsg
Hi  on the HSBC EGA giro deduction  I have checked with HSBC that the payment to my DBS credit card has been setup. However  I have not received any confirmation from DBS. Can I assume that giro will go through this month or I still need to wait for the letter from DBS?,btohqsg
ur dbs cc statement need to indicate payment will be via GIRO,btohqsg

Thanks MH. My bill never state anything yet. So even if DBS CSO tell me don‚Äôt error will be giro  I should ignore and pay manually right?,btohqsg
Using Kris+ link to UOB card but amount was incorrect so the merchant made a refund back to Kris+ but my card was charged,btohqsg

For CardUp paid using cashback cards  seems like currently the highest cashback % cards are Maybank Platinum Visa and DCS?Or anyone using CardUp to pay for mortgage and MCST can recommend cashback cards? üòÅ,btohqsg
Think count as base spend but not in any CC spend category for bonus. Better to use other cards unless u also using ocbc365 for normal spend (to make up for the 800 min spend),btohqsg
MCST quarterly right? Depending on amount I thought BOC CC better for it. As Maybank need to be consistent for the quarter. More suitable for mortgage.,btohqsg
Really? How come Heymax shows 4mpd for wwmc?,btohqsg
I use BOC Family card and OCBC FRANK,btohqsg
Which DCS card can be used a?,btohqsg
I think DCS Ultimate Platinum Card. But I'm still in the research phase. Haven't used it yet.,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt DCS 2% cashback? Tot cardup has a fee?,btohqsg
