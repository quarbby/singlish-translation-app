Please don't try Jit Poh building,btohqsg
Honestly just keep driving and you will get a hang of it,btohqsg
"If you're unsure and want to ""prepare""",btohqsg
The new ones have digital instrument clusters,btohqsg
But only the 3 and cx-30,btohqsg
Mazda doesn't seem to want to update any of their other lineup,btohqsg
All still stuck on the older infotainment  instrument clusters and older assist tech,btohqsg
y’all haven’t tried parking at katong shopping centre,btohqsg
These 2 have the newest offerings from Mazda since late 2018/early 2019,btohqsg
Hiya…those architect who designed the car park does not have any foresight.,btohqsg
They never expect car sizes will expand,btohqsg
the man or the vacuum cleaner,btohqsg
Actually you would be surprised at how big cars were back then too,btohqsg
Just that people were better at driving and had more spaces to park,btohqsg
i wonder how much will it costs to fix it,btohqsg
dajie please go take refresher if u need,btohqsg
i will...just wondering why i love to scratch cars,btohqsg
as long as scratch isnt too deep to rust  shld be fine,btohqsg
its okay we all make mistakes,btohqsg
Hit own car no issues  can fix. But don't hit others,btohqsg
Hit curb  hit wall  hit railings,btohqsg
Don’t fix .. yet. Collect some more for another 3-6 months then one shot to fix together.,btohqsg
The scars are reminders of lessons you’ve learned,btohqsg
Deeeeep but true. Especially the emotional scars.,btohqsg
"Whenever I go up the ramp  at the spiral I would align my vehicle near the centre of the spiral railing  until i see my wing mirror is ""touching"" the centre wall  at the same time I can monitor the gap between the wall and my rear vehicle body via the wing mirror. Its my hack 😁",btohqsg
You just need to hone your estimation skills e.g. when you sit at your driver seat and see the kerb positioned at the centre of your hood  how far is the kerb from your car side body etc,btohqsg
Hey  high 5  that's why I prefer to own a car than rent,btohqsg
Yeah man hahaha buang the wall better than buang that opposite car coming 😂😂,btohqsg
I used to try and centre my car  now I just hug the wall closest to me  especially since you never know when you’ll see a car eat into your lane coming the opposite direction,btohqsg
I swear sometimes I shart a little like a deer in headlights when that happens,btohqsg
This reminds me of my BBDC days!,btohqsg

“LIGHTS OUT AND AWAY WE GO”,btohqsg
Been there done that  years back when just started in singapore during after race on the track hehe,btohqsg
the thing is...i got no prob with the spiral ones,btohqsg
only the ramp ones with tight spaces..i phobia,btohqsg
and i was very slow cos of the tight spaces,btohqsg
yesterday i was too focus on the front and forgot the back,btohqsg
You always have to just remember to go wide and cut in really close,btohqsg
Otherwise  you won’t have the right angle  no matter what see you go,btohqsg
ya. shall bring along a giant compass to measure the angle before i turn,btohqsg
thnk i just collect a few more battle scars before i send in for touch ups,btohqsg
and can i ask something? i find the car pick up and response getting lag lately,btohqsg
is it becos of the fuel that i pump or could it be other issues? i only kena scratch but not hitting with other things,btohqsg
This is the best carpark to practice at,btohqsg
the pick up takes around 2 seconds compared to the last time when i first used the car,btohqsg
I’ve….just valet but self park out front,btohqsg
Shows that you are getting used to the car,btohqsg
This is also true. My car used to feel fast  now it feels slow.,btohqsg
i just got this car like 2 months back,btohqsg
New car. Congrats. Any service records? 😂,btohqsg
If it’s that new I guess it’s also what Rick said,btohqsg
Low downpayment high loans guaranteed affordable.,btohqsg
In-house financing  2k income also can drive!,btohqsg
Very true. Do not fret  we will sell you the car for 70k when the paper value is less than 30k😅😅,btohqsg
Eh. But we pay only 30k.,btohqsg
What we sell is not what you get 😉,btohqsg
Trust me  your every single dollar is well spent when you are getting a rare car😅😅,btohqsg
dunno when is the next servicing..got it from an unreliable car dealer,btohqsg
i dun even know if i can trust whatever they say or not,btohqsg

sourcing for a reliable workshop also,btohqsg
Heard the new volvo C40 is at Surrey Hills Grocer @SGCM_Adminare you guys there?,btohqsg
Not sure about other departments  but our side not there - J,btohqsg
Don't try the mount e lift if you can't do weird angles and narrow lifts,btohqsg
Maybe just send in for a service yourself? Did you get any service records of the car at all when purchasing?,btohqsg
that's why i say i bought it from a wrong place,btohqsg
Yeah that's not a very good thing when buying a car.....,btohqsg
I don't think it's the place,btohqsg
There's a lot of cars that sell without service history  must pull out from AD or ask for a first service/discount for one and start your own cycle,btohqsg
And PPI to figure out if any work has been done before and wear and tear has been done up,btohqsg
i really doubt the words from the sales person,btohqsg
and i am thinking if i should just send it to komoco for thorough workout (servicing),btohqsg
after that  i will just find a workshop to maintain it,btohqsg
Komoco will surely do a thorough servicing,btohqsg
They will also do a thorough job at emptying your bank account,btohqsg
For the same thing that could be cheaper outside,btohqsg
Well all you have is his word since you didn't secure any receipts  paperwork or do an inspection before purchase,btohqsg
Would suggest you find a good workshop for your car. Since your car is quite basic and a lot of units around,btohqsg
Any shop that has good ratings and has worked on japanese and Korean cars should be fine,btohqsg
maintain for a year and see if i can sell it away to get something else,btohqsg
You can use this as a training car!,btohqsg
And the next one you buy,btohqsg
Can be a better unit where you look into service history  ownership  do an inspection,btohqsg
Check multiple units for the same model  etc.,btohqsg
But try a service and see if you feel a difference,btohqsg
If not  you've just gotten used to the power it offers,btohqsg
Lag could be belt  could be gear,btohqsg
My car became scary fast and my brakes too underpowered,btohqsg
Ohh the one cannot stop is you ah?,btohqsg
or maybe it could just be that the car is slow,btohqsg
@SGCM_Adminyou all got one massive loophole.,btohqsg
I can’t cuss but I can if the Queen doesn’t understand me. May God let her soul rest in peace.,btohqsg
Is your boot now filled up with spoiler or home storage items?,btohqsg
Not you lah. Your Audi stage 9.5. 🚀,btohqsg
i'm not living in a car,btohqsg
You’ll be surprised. I don’t live in one either but at one point in time  the car was extra storage for my sad shoebox apartment,btohqsg
No lah  some people also put chairs,btohqsg
she has 2 camping chairs at the back,btohqsg
You know hor.. some people really use boot as extended home storeroom one,btohqsg
And this guy has a spoiler.,btohqsg
Why you never invite me sit,btohqsg
Cause you always ask him to sit on your lap,btohqsg
