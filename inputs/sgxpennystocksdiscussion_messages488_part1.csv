If the ascentia sky is up to top .. will affect our price ..,btohqsg
Now the whole row is condo .. the price will affected metropolitan more .. cos it a old project already,btohqsg
Sky ascentia facing MRT units so sad  at first got sea view  after ARTRA comes up  all gone,btohqsg
Yes .. that the point .. that y .. no more much up trend price,btohqsg
M quite ok because it is at one end  view not affected,btohqsg
ARTRA is horrible  right at the centre  block everybody,btohqsg
Very noisy by the mrt too,btohqsg
I thought sell condo must 6 months then can buy hdb,btohqsg
How u move to Boon Tiong,btohqsg
Echelon never kanna block and Alex residential never block too,btohqsg
No need .. resale no need wait .. straight can but .. bto must wait for 24 month than can,btohqsg
ARTRA block Echelon 45 degree view,btohqsg
Abit only .. my friend stay there . I went up to his unit and see Liao,btohqsg
Maybe depends on which end of the developement,btohqsg
That one buy for enbloc or location,btohqsg
Enbloc is bonus .. next year mop  I see the price .. if good then sell .. not so good then continue collect rental first,btohqsg
But I see enbloc chance quite high ..,btohqsg
Now I think of moving somewhere near MRT and shopping centre with supermarket,btohqsg
Depending on the owners want to sign anot .  Cos in order to approve enbloc .. must get 80 percent owner sign then can go forward,btohqsg
Your Redhill HDB is bto ? Or resales?,btohqsg
But this is no relevant  I want somewhere got shopping centre and MRT  can't find a place,btohqsg
Make sure you are below 45 year old when you sell ..,btohqsg
Tiong Bahru here my side .. haha,btohqsg
At first I wanted to buy Jalan Membina but don't like the layout,btohqsg
Cos if not all your money will go back to cpf account and will lock under retirement account .,btohqsg
Those money that you use cpf to pay for your Installment .. when you sell all will go back to your cpf account plus interest,btohqsg
Oh ya .. haha .. I thought 45 . Mistake,btohqsg
Come see boon tiong .. good layout .,btohqsg
Boon Tiong I only want 9A or 10A. The rest too far from MRT,btohqsg
This 2 BLK just beside me only .. haha,btohqsg
There is one more new mrt line coming up the brown line,btohqsg
The condo there not cheap ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
The other place I'm thinking is Buona Vista but Star Vista like nothing much,btohqsg
