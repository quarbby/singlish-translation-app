Is it possible to skip grades in Singapore,btohqsg
Like enter poly at 15 ex,btohqsg
I met this girl earlier this week,btohqsg
Who said she was in poly y3 at 17,btohqsg
Didnâ€™t know if she was jokin or bullshitting or something,btohqsg
But she said it with a very serious face so,btohqsg
u either have to be 18 or 19 to be in y3,btohqsg
But itâ€™s a lie that Iâ€™ve never heard before,btohqsg
And she said it with such a dead serious face,btohqsg
So I thought she was being for real,btohqsg
Genuinely never heard of something like this before,btohqsg
its actually funny how a y3 girl at 17 is being serious about her lie,btohqsg
My friend dropped out of poly to go army first then attend a private Uni,btohqsg
So itâ€™s possible that she like skipped 2 years in primary school?,btohqsg
that you can literally get a promo,btohqsg
If Iâ€™m not wrong the gifted years programmes used to allow pri school kids to skip 1 yr,btohqsg
like if u all subj 100%,btohqsg
Most school wonâ€™t allow students to skip grades because  if a student does well it reflects nicely about the schoolâ€¦So most of the times  if a student does skip grades..they are exceptionally smart,btohqsg
ok just searched it up it's not ture,btohqsg
To the point that parents of other students may complain,btohqsg
all schools don't allow you to skip levels,btohqsg
so it is definitely not possible to be a y3 student at 17,btohqsg
how about being a foriegn student,btohqsg
