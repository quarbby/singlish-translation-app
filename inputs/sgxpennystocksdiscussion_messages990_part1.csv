$MSFT- OPENAI SAYS IT HAS EVIDENCE CHINA’S DEEPSEEK USED ITS MODEL TO TRAIN COMPETITOROPENAI SAYS IT HAS FOUND EVIDENCE THAT CHINESE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE START-UP DEEPSEEK USED THE US COMPANY’S PROPRIETARY MODELS TO TRAIN ITS OWN OPEN-SOURCE COMPETITOR  AS CONCERNS GROW OVER A POTENTIAL BREACH OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY....,btohqsg

Anyway it is a joke because Open AI's data was simply scraped from the web without permission,btohqsg
It was literally lots of stolen data.,btohqsg
How does ChatGPT know all the shit it knows? Because it just crawls the web and trains anything it can find that it deems useful. Same for AI image generation.

Trump can try but there's no moral ground to be had for anyone that knows how AI works. Won't stop them though.,btohqsg
