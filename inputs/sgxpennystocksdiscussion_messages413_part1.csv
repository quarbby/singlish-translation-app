Um-chio: 暗笑 to gloat over someone  usually at his misfortune3. Um-Gan: 暗干 to curse at someone in silence4. Um-bai: 暗牌 colloquial for spy5. Um-um lao bak sai: 暗暗流泪😭 to weep in silence6. Um-gong: 暗杠 to score a lucky goal7. Um-dui 暗捶 regretted silentlyNow to string them all in a story:The General took umbrage at a reporter’s question during a press conference.He um-gan the reporter when he thought she insinuated he will be a lackey for the establishment even after he restructure the company.Not realising that the reporter was actually a um-bai planted by his rival  he went ballistic and incurred public wrath.The um-bai camp um-chio over their um-gong...While the General um-um lao bak sai after he was forced to apologise.🤣🤣🤣Post note : shareholders um-dui never early early sell off SPH sharesThis one super funny! Only Singaporeans can understand! 😝,btohqsg
