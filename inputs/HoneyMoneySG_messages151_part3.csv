Advice u to overpay to cover one month extra interest. What u see on statement isn’t what u currently owe in total. Due to accrued interest and lag time,btohqsg
Just FYI.Paying minimum avoids you being charged late fees. But you are still charged interest on the unpaid balance. Please don't let the interest accumulate — credit card interest really high,btohqsg
No matter how tight the cash  always pay in full. Budget your spending with whatever is remaining.Reminder that interest accrues daily. Best to pay the card off immediately.,btohqsg
you should pay the full amount that is due now  then apply for interest waiver. don't accumulate credit card interest  rate very high,btohqsg
Can apply for interest waiver? Do i call uob?,btohqsg
iirc  the app should be able to (automatic decision). but pls pls pay the full balance,btohqsg
if the request is rejected  then maybe you need to speak to uob cso to request,btohqsg
Guys question regarding optionsI sold covered calls that expires next friday  i received premium and stock is below strike price but the option appears in my portfolio as negative now.Any explanation ? From moomoo btw,btohqsg
How does longbridge 8% work? Need to buy any fund? Or just leave it,btohqsg
Anyone knows if i make a shopee order for $600 using uob one card but returned the order for a refund in the next month  am I still eligible for the 4% p.a. interest?,btohqsg
Short options will always have a negative value due to the time value of options  even if out of the money.,btohqsg
Lets say sofi dosent go above 20 next friday and the option expires out of the money which means its not exercisesWill i get the negative balance and will it affect my overall portfolio balance ?,btohqsg
It will drop off.The value u see now is just unrealised mtm loss.,btohqsg

Hi did you see it on the statement?Do we always have to see statement?As the rewards points page inside app doesn't seem to show these?,btohqsg
Can I check if anyone knows if I reg for new webull user promo. Say if the requirements need to top up 10k the execute 3 trades and maintain for 60 days. Do I need to top up extra $ to perform the 3 trades depending on the trade values or can use from the 10k deposit amount? TIA,btohqsg
My understanding the 28% is not based on the unpaid amount but calculate using the transaction amount from the date of transaction  not statement date or due date. Is it correct?,btohqsg
What if the interest has already been credited?,btohqsg
Hello! For the 3 trades for $2000 NVDA tier  is there a minimum sum per trade? Thanks!,btohqsg

Can I pair scb simply cash cc with Kris+ to meet the min $800 spend for new sign up?,btohqsg
will not be forfeited. But for the month the refund is made need to spend and posted in the month 500+refund amount,btohqsg
no it is based on the Unpaid rolled over outstanding.e.g. Total Transactions was $1000. Minimum due is $100  you paid $200.No late feeYou incur 28% p.a. interest on $800. WHEN the 28% p.a. interest honestly I don't know since I don't do such.. ermm... unoptimal things.It could either be 28% p.a. interest from transaction date or from Due date. i am not sure.,btohqsg
It can be seem in uob tmrw under my reward tab where it show the point breakdown,btohqsg
interest start incurring after due date,btohqsg
This promotion is fromhttps://www.spdigital.sg/spapp/uob-promotion.Can anyone confirm if it applies to the UOB PRVI card? Also  will we earn miles if we set it as the default card for recurring payments in the SP app?,btohqsg
"It says ""Earn cashback  miles or rewards* for bill payments with UOB Cards"".. is this tested and proven by anyone?",btohqsg
Realise IRAS only allow eGIRO application for income tax payment now  subject to exceptions. As HSBC is one of the listed banks for eGIRO  it means we have no choice but to apply via eGIRO if we want to pay via HSBC EGA.  For those who applied via eGIRO recently  able to share any data point if GIRO income tax payment via initial eGIRO application still earns the 1% bonus cashback? I would think so since eGIRO is just an electronic form of application but underlying deduction is via the same GIRO network? Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
SingSaver/OCBC offer pulled the brakes on this  wait for further notice,btohqsg

Hi All. Anybody knows if I received uob one credit card quarter cash back on 31st Dec  so my new quarter will be Jan Feb March?,btohqsg
Based on my experience it should be Dec Jan Feb. I received the cashback at the end of the 1st month,btohqsg
Not reallyYou incur interest for $1000 from each and every transaction dateThen lowered to the $800 till you settle the $800.You also need to consider new transactions from new statement.If you pay the $800 plus the previous month interest charge. Then no further interest will be charged.This is  assuming your transaction is not cash advance.,btohqsg
Anyone knows what is the best payment arrangement for travellors to China?,btohqsg
Thanks. Can Alipay be linked to a SG credit card? Is the payment denominated in SGD or CNY?,btohqsg
yes you can  in CNY of cos. Extra 3% service charge if payment >200 CNY,btohqsg
Setup WeChat pay together with Alipay for redundancy purpose.,btohqsg
Also you may need cmlink for Internet access for western website and app. Just it is quite expensive for the data.,btohqsg
"It is a pain to switch internet access when you need to access the ""banned"" apps",btohqsg
Any idea if paying through Kris+ app at food places will qualify for the spend tracked under this promo too?,btohqsg
Alternatively  if you have data roaming  like M1 passport etc  IG/FB will work.,btohqsg
