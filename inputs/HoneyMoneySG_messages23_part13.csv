Hi Guys  can I ask  I have Grab wallet (no Grab card) & UOB Absolute. I note that Absolute > Grab wallet will be reduced from 1.7% to 0.3% on and after 15 Jan 2023. I also note that AXS can't pay by Absolute (because AMEX)  so can I check if I can just top-up  use Absolute to top-up Grab wallet to the max $30k to earn 1.7% then slowly use the wallet to make payments via AXS until the $30k is used up? Will I need to apply for the Grab card to make payment via AXS?,btohqsg
i think you will need grabpay card because we pay axs machine through mastercard,btohqsg
Grabpay card is debit card from the grab wallet is it? so technically I should be able to top-up use the Absolute card to top-up the wallet to earn the 1.7% first then slowly use the Grab card to pay bills through AXS?,btohqsg
Max top up $10k due to the monthly limit. Chris did a video on this,btohqsg
The maximum that your Grab wallet can contain at any one time is S$5k.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  which card is a better choice to buy air tickets ? Ocbc 365 or UOB one ?,btohqsg
Issit possible to credit salary to both uob one and ocbc 360  ask the hr to distribute the salary ?,btohqsg
Depends on company. I know of one company that allows that but think most won't allow as it's hard to manage. Their payroll system might not even support this too.,btohqsg
Agreed thr HR or finance will get pissed,btohqsg
Hi guys  am I right to say that shopback purchases will always be online purchase  and MCC will depend on the merchant you are paying (e.g. Lazada vs hawker). The question is for CIMB visa signature card and UOB EVOL,btohqsg
hi guys  does anyone known if top up cpf to loved ones  how long will it take to process?,btohqsg
Can transfer for KrisPay miles to KrisFlyer miles? Why I donâ€™t see it  only see to KP miles,btohqsg
Hi  guys. Im wondering if we will be 1.5% fee charged like oversea spending if we use amaze card in sg? and the rewards points from citi rewards cc can be redeem to other gift  like vouchers?,btohqsg
Nope the fees only apply for foreign currency that is not SGD,btohqsg
Yes citi rewards card can redeem vouchers or cashback also,btohqsg
You will have something like these and your Grab Finance will have a GXS wallet asking you to link it  Grab will send you a notification asking you to sign up and link GXS for reward you with 2500 grab point,btohqsg
based on my understanding  only KP miles earned from payments can transfer from KP to KF,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI got 1 rly good purchase home appliance too  hair trimmer and scissors  both <$50 but saved me >$1k over the past 4 years of cutting my hair at home every 2 weeks instead of going to the barber ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Nice  I just didn't like the cleaning up part so I just go to neighbourhood barber,btohqsg
Must see which Bank account you using  to hit the $500 spend,btohqsg
I have both ocbc 360 and UOB one account ðŸ¤£ not sure if purchase air tickets is eligible for cashback,btohqsg
Hi everyone  for a young person that just started working  would it make sense to top up MA for tax relief? What is the pros and cons for long term.,btohqsg
advantage of topping up MA now is mainly for tax relief  and not so much about the interest (since current interest rates are high). Tax relief is useful if at least in the 40k to 80k income bracket. Save $7 tax expense per $100 topped up to MA,btohqsg
Anyone use hsbc advance credit card? 2.5% cash back if spend min 2k. Better than usual 1.5%..,btohqsg
Hi all  what cards would you tag with amaze for hotel bookings?,btohqsg
Hi thank you for your response. Curious why you put the income bracket from 40-80? If abv 80 not worth?,btohqsg
higher then even more worth. 80k to 120k income bracket is $11.5 saved per $100,btohqsg
Below 20k no point. Below 40k not much point. Above 40k then can start to consider. Personal opinion,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not that itâ€™s no point  itâ€™s just that when you earn higher income you are taxed a higher percentage hence you â€˜saveâ€™ moreOf course when you are in the lower bracket you top up to save lesser  so to each his own,btohqsg
also have to consider that your money is 'stuck' once it goes into CPF. Can be a good or bad thing,btohqsg
So would it be fair to compare in terms of opp cost.(7% tax savings + 4% int in MA) vs (4% avg for fixed deposits)Apart from the money being stuck in MA,btohqsg
I think itâ€™s good practice to top up in proportion to your income,btohqsg
After weighing in the pros and cons  DYODD,btohqsg
you can put it that way. It is basically trading X% tax savings for the liquidity. I feel that it is more compelling to top up MA when interest rates are low,btohqsg
Hi couldnâ€™t find info on this so looking for some help:If I make a transaction today (30 Dec)  would it likely to post on 03 Jan only or can it potentially post tomorrow (31 Dec)Asking since I want to utilise my rewards limits which resets on 1st of every month. Thanks!,btohqsg
really depends on when the merchant do the posting.,btohqsg
