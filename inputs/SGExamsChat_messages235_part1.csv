"Hey everyone  as many of you might know  SGExams has recently registered as a society  and we continue to run different projects and operations such as our website and offline events (pre-COVID).Previously  we relied a lot on government grants to fund our projects and operations  and dug our own pockets to fund the remainder. However  going down the road  we would like to seek a more sustainable form of cash flow for funding so that we have more autonomy and ability to bring initiatives to you guys!Hence  we are looking to establish partnerships with private  for profit companies.Before  we did not allow for profit companies and entities to post as we cannot 100% ascertain their motivations behind promotion  and with that  we wanted to protect you guys from any cases of predatory advertising or posting.How this will work is that these companies will be allowed to post on our platforms for a sum of money. On our side  we will ensure that these posts are relevant and of high quality  with benefit to the SGExams community. This means no blatant ""Sign up for x course"" sort of posts  but rather posts like AMAs  FAQs or resources that will be provided to you guys. You can find an example of such a post here:https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/e0deoi.For Tele  we are looking at portal/chat group posts for events/webinars  in addition to the items mentioned above. This list may be expandedRest assured  we will ensure that the chat group and portal remains conducive  and not spam these posts frequently.Accepting money for something like that is a huge decision that involves not just those of us managing SGExams  but you guys too. This is why we would like to find out your sentiments regarding this action. Let us know how you feel by responding to the poll below.By the way  any money that we earn will 100% go back to the society to fund events and operations  especially those that are conducted offline. We are legally required to audit and report our financial transactions every year  so rest assured that it is all being channeled back to the community aka you guys :)As for non profit organizations and individuals who are already working with us  do not fret! We will still continue working with you guys as per our agreed upon terms :) After all  giving back to the community and helping each other out is what SGExams is all about! We will make sure that everyone's interests are balanced as much as possible.Looking forward to your responses! Do let us know if you have any questions or suggestions in the comments.",btohqsg
it was just a figure of speech ahaa,btohqsg
someone said yesterday that biology wasnt as useful as physics,btohqsg
but we should stop hating on others now,btohqsg
As a 3rd year physics majorI disagree too,btohqsg
All the best for your studies.,btohqsg
I'm sorry if i said anything hurtful.,btohqsg
nono lmao i was so curious what the context was,btohqsg
I’m ok with that because SGExams is an excellent  platform. I just hope there will be a cap as to how many of such posts there will be so that posts by individuals can continue.,btohqsg
i think im more interested in how sgexams is going to price it,btohqsg
and what considers as a paid post and what is not?,btohqsg
like what will be the difference between posting as an individual representing a business but doing a personal ama,btohqsg
or doing an ama about the business,btohqsg
Hi I'm sorry if I ask in this wrong chat. But is there a smaller study group for j2 that I can join? Do PM if u have a group that dont mind me joining. Thank you for your kind attention ;),btohqsg
I think it's really on a case by base basis. if the individual ama is still promoting a paid product  or distinctly represents a brand that is for-profit  then it would be still a sponsored post.but again  rly do be case by case basis haha  q hard to give a definitive answer,btohqsg
a sponsored post will clearly be labelled to show that SGExams might benefit monetarily from any interaction you make with the post,btohqsg
what if a forprofit org does csr  maybe like employees do a push up challenge to raise funds for a charity  and promotes it in sgexams through  with various employees coming on to do AMAs and free mentoring for redditors. would that need to be paid or non paid?,btohqsg
fundamentally  it's still a for profit  so our initial stance will still be paid. however further discussions both with the partner and within the team itself could change our stance in this particular instance,btohqsg
and on a personal level  I want to remind everyone that when you donate to a company's charity drive  all you're allowing them to do is pay less taxes... better to donate directly  maybe you get tax rebates instead,btohqsg
glances at mcdonalds whenever i try to order smth from them in store,btohqsg
what abt businesses who provide services to students to raise funds for sgexams? e.g. business provide service  students pay money to sgexams for service  business don't get any money?,btohqsg
SGExams itself doesn't have plans atm to charge anyone  anything for a service that we might provide. if the business charges  and it's promoted through our platforms  a way that SGExams could earn is through a cut of their revenue,btohqsg
but SGExams itself doesn't have plans in the foreseeable future to develop any programmes that we charge students for,btohqsg
"so in this specific case  whatcouldhappen is the student pays the business for a specific service  and SGExams earns a little from the revenue as sort of a ""commission/referral fee""",btohqsg
I see  kinda interesting how sgexams is moving forward,btohqsg
internally we do have plans for events at a bigger scale  but the funds has to come from somewhere  and this is one way we figured we could raise parts of that capital,btohqsg
any sneak peak into the bigger events?,btohqsg
unfortunately not  still too early in the works for me to say anything,btohqsg
what I can say though  and this isn't an event  is that people can look forward to a refreshed look for our website,btohqsg
oh no im being judged by icedmilo,btohqsg
