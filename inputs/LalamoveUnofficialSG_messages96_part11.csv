there was once i took a job from MBS to Westgate. 4 cartons. forgot to bring trolley so i have to carry one by one from the shop to the car and the car to the shop.i went in and out of MBS 4 times to avoid paying parking charges. Knowing where the shop is and where to park in MBS also impt. need to do homework before going in.but for Westgate its about $1.20-$1.40 so thats ok.,btohqsg
