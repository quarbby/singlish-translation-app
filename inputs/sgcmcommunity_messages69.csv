anyw yes we have both GR86 and BRZ 2.4,btohqsg
I kena before in sg  sg car,btohqsg
The person stood in the middle of the parallel lot. I knew what she was trying to do  but i ignored and slwoly inched in anyway,btohqsg
And then the typical comments came  u think u drive bmw you can do this? Etc etc,btohqsg
Funny how people in the wrong can be so self righteous and even try to insult others instead,btohqsg
Hahahah sounds quite comical actually. Would have loved to watch the video,btohqsg
They very good at playing victim. The optics not in your favour though. People will jump to conclusion and say m3 driver bullying poor girl,btohqsg
The father came in the end  and ask me to be gentleman,btohqsg
But long story short i eventually gave up the lot to them. I could be hero and stand firm  but i could be zero if they were to vandalize my car.,btohqsg
Wasnt even m3 at that time haha. Just a e82 1 series  so they maybe thinking can bully haha,btohqsg
Nowadays cant be too aggressive  people just video you and shame online,btohqsg
And if u dont have story or evidence to back up then it'll become a shit show,btohqsg
Thats a clickbait. I actually drive a x6m,btohqsg
sadly a lot of such videos sia,btohqsg
E9x m3 are for drag race losers,btohqsg

Ya thats true. Some like fart cans haha,btohqsg
Nice car spotted from hotel room,btohqsg
Thats a clean MK4 Golf TDi. Dont see that in sg.,btohqsg
I Kenna with one whole family standing in the lot but the car nowhere to be seen  they calling the driver of the car I'm guessing. Tried inching but then the kids start walking too close to the car so just left it there. Don't want to hurt any kids for their parents' stupidity,btohqsg
But then you must strip naked for Mr Se,btohqsg
Tbh. If i see this. They are that desperate for a lot,btohqsg
But there's other lots empty around,btohqsg
And it isn't a lot close to the lifts that it might be for someone older,btohqsg
At the end the pedestrian wins,btohqsg
Then just park other lots i guess. I mean... are you that hard up for a lot.,btohqsg
"They look stupid is enough alr. Going to ""fight""  end up both stupid",btohqsg
That's why give up after trying one time,btohqsg
The lot nice cause can protective park,btohqsg
People like that really no point. If they can stand around choping a lot  they can also stand around waiting for you to leave your car then come back and give you a nice key line across.,btohqsg

The picture of the XC60 is in Inscription trim but SG only offers R-Design trim.,btohqsg
Vast difference in design styling although both are the highest trim,btohqsg
to add  R-Design trim is nicer imo🫣🫣,btohqsg
HMMMM  IMO I think the image in the article serves as a generic image to provide readers with an idea of how the car looks like in general. Hope that answers your question!😊-R,btohqsg
singapore allows removal of front car number plate?,btohqsg
any idea if i wanna shift my number plate on avante cn7  can i move it lower? to show my front grill,btohqsg

Can I get a new heart too.,btohqsg
Engine rebuilt but other parts of the car still receive wear and tear. Other drivetrain components still will have significant wear and tear,btohqsg
Do front tyre wear faster regardless of fwd or rwd?,btohqsg
if u get a new heart  automatically reset age,btohqsg
Why you ask me? I’m just a .. rickshaw puller ..,btohqsg
suspension and brakes componnents also will have wear and tear,btohqsg
cos... you listen to your passengers everyday... YOU MUST KNOW SOMETHING ABT THIS CAR!!!,btohqsg
depends on ur suspension set up allignment etc,btohqsg
Yes. It comes with a new engine 😘,btohqsg
+- 10% i say its okay for rwd,btohqsg
but really depend on how u drive lor,btohqsg
Normal for front to wear more?,btohqsg
cos front does the steering and and take a heavier load during braking,btohqsg
if u dont go tiong ppl brake hard etc,btohqsg
Ah OK. That's what I guessed but then better ask than to fake know,btohqsg
Your tyre wear won't change la unless you're doing burnouts,btohqsg
If you drift  rear tyre will wear faster.,btohqsg
That why ppl buy Volvo 😱,btohqsg

i haven’t wash in 2 weeks,btohqsg
so many great roads around but most cars never leave PIE 😂,btohqsg
My quick car wash method is about 15mins.Prepare 3 cloths (2 cheap 1 premium)Prep: car soap water mixture in a water pump spray (those that can be used to water plants)$2.$1 HDB spray gun wet car bodySpray soap all aroundUse the first cheap cloth to wipe stubborn dirt's that can be removed with soapThen $1 spray gun again.Then use the 2nd cheap cloth to dry the car. Squeeze the towel to dry.Then use the expensive towel to wipe dry for spotless clean.These is my procedure before I cover my car.,btohqsg
Anyone interested if I film a video of myself doing this in 15mins? 🤣,btohqsg
And what expensive towel do you use,btohqsg
Drying is tough when you’re not ceramic coated,btohqsg
Blue: cheap 10cent shopee flash sale cloth.White: more expensive 800gsm cloth,btohqsg

hi  just wanna check with you guys...how long it takes to transfer ownership of a vehicle?,btohqsg
i driving for a week and still no ownership transfer,btohqsg
Oh no  always make sure they transfee the ownership within the day of car collection/deposit.,btohqsg
One week is normal  especially when your loan not straightforward,btohqsg
Some dealer let you collect car as soon as you pay deposit and sign agreement,btohqsg
Buy car usually within the day or two. Sell car will take longer if you have outstanding loan with the previous dealer.,btohqsg
loan was approved and all payments including insurance and the rest were settled on the handing/taking over day,btohqsg
Then on the day itself should receive the SMS from LTA ask you confirm the transfer,btohqsg
the sales told me takes about 7 to 10 working days,btohqsg
lol..i called up LTA to verify,btohqsg
Some dealer just work slower if they sell larger volume of cars. After this 7-10 working days still not settle then start to worry,btohqsg
so i called up LTA and to realised it's still under the company's name,btohqsg
then i called up the sales  she said needs time cos they handle not just one vehicle,btohqsg
and it's gov website this n that,btohqsg
though i tried to tell her LTA says otherwise,btohqsg
until i called up the finance company....the truth revealed....,btohqsg
like kena constipated for a long time and then release,btohqsg
i've been cheated by this sales,btohqsg
i dunno if it's considered cheated or wa,btohqsg
but the finance guy told me they had hurried the sales to get me sign the PDPA form. the sales gal said will meet up with me today (noooo!!!) and get it done,btohqsg
i said i din hear her say anything about it,btohqsg
This is what I experienced too,btohqsg
"and like those ppl said ""never offend a woman""",btohqsg
It's normal actually  paperwork delay. But the sales also bs la,btohqsg
i asked for updates all the time and sometimes i dun get a reply,btohqsg
or it's just delaying and delaying,btohqsg
They also anyhow lol paperwork not in order can still let you takeover,btohqsg
we signed all the necessary papers and we did not get any photocopied of the hire purchase agreement,btohqsg
on my end  it was my fault for not insisting for it as well,btohqsg
Huh  the dealer should give it to you without you having to request it,btohqsg
and only to give one piece of this lousy piece of shit,btohqsg
Try to insist a copy of all docs you signed,btohqsg
Chill...it's yours now so treat it like your baby lol the previous owner didn't take care of it well,btohqsg
i'm writing to all parties concerned including casetrust,btohqsg
no. i am gonna make them answer,btohqsg
Whose Tesla 3 with number 222,btohqsg

Instantly when buying the car over as most dealers handover only when loan is disbursed to them and you have insurance since one has to enter insurance policy details to transfer ownership.,btohqsg
It takes 5 minutes to transfer ownership and requires you to be there as well so I don't see how handling many vehicles is an issue,btohqsg
True but if her loan settled  insurance settled. Transfer ownership is 5 minute thing online  doesn't take so long,btohqsg
Some more they never give her purchase agreement,btohqsg
Very easy for them to report the vehicle stolen and scam her if they want to,btohqsg
Say cos will not only my car they are handling but also others,btohqsg
Sell for profit from new to used  I also want hahah,btohqsg
Very strange  for every car we have got or my friends  transfer happens on the day of handover,btohqsg
When I traded in my car  the new (2nd hand) car was transfered to me on the day of collection. Old car however was still under my name for 10 days (due to outstanding loan and ex dealer was very slow)  I also checked LTA website and chased my new dealer everyday for that 10 days 😂,btohqsg
For once I agree with Mr Se,btohqsg
The community comes together to support each other!!!!!! Woahhhh,btohqsg
A pile of lies from that dealer,btohqsg
Ask them to speed up the window switch also,btohqsg
This one parts came and going tomolo,btohqsg
