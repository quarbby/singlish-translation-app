Please don't misconstrue what I mean  yes  we all do retain memories but they would being no benefit if we don't apply the knowledge behind it in our everyday lives.,btohqsg
If u mean everyday lives then u don't need anything beyond sec 2,btohqsg

Haha yeah some ppl developed a fever.,btohqsg
First dose: Sore for one daySecond dose: Sore & redness for a few days  fever on second day (37.7)  tiredness on second day  slight headache on second day. After the sore & redness subsided I got shoulder bone pain for a few days,btohqsg
A few of my ns platoon mates got fever which went over 39 deg c,btohqsg
But still. All these should not stop you all from taking the vaccine,btohqsg
moderna is more severe than pfizer,btohqsg
I don't feel any side effect.,btohqsg
Other than my arm is swelling.,btohqsg
i mean they say the stronger ur immune system the more likely for adverse side effects,btohqsg
True. But even if you got no side effects it doesn't mean the vaccine isn't working,btohqsg
I heard the fever occurrence rate for moderna is lower than Pfizer according to clinical trials. But considering all side effects  according to sg data  moderna (74.8%) does have more frequent side effects than Pfizer (64.2%). But also  the risk of anaphylaxis to the Moderna vaccine is about half or less than half of the Pfizer vaccine,btohqsg

side effects was fever for about three days plus leg numb super tired arm weakness lasting for more than 2 weeks,btohqsg
