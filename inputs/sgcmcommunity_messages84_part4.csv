Dun really trust the maintenance of bluesg. So many of them kena accidents dk workshop got fix it properly anot,btohqsg
I trust the drivers less than the cars,btohqsg
If u dun trust the drivers  dont think u cqn trust the cars too  considering how badly some of them drive 🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
No matter how well maintained cars are  if the drivers substandard then the driving will be rubbish,btohqsg
I trust a decent driver with a poorly maintained car over a lousy driver with well maintained car if that makes sense?,btohqsg
At most the poorly maintained car break down  and decent drivers I believe will take better care of the car,btohqsg
No offence but I don't trust blue SG drivers.,btohqsg
Same here...in fact most car sharing drivers I dun trust,btohqsg
Always give them a wide berth 🤭,btohqsg
I’d rather miss my turn than have to cross path with a bluesg 🤣,btohqsg

What were steps you took to follow thru hdb’s guideline “refund prior to termination”,btohqsg

and when i saw other getgo cars  the scratches were very deep and extensive,btohqsg
