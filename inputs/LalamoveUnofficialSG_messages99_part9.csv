Hi bro & sis  just join Lalamove,btohqsg
I registered as a Walker but realise that all orders are so far,btohqsg
How am I going to walk,btohqsg
The rate is not very favourite,btohqsg
If cancel account  can get back the money?,btohqsg
I mean rate is quite low after commission,btohqsg
lalamove rates are the highest in sg for short distances  starts at $10. Do one of the food platforms better for more walkable distances.,btohqsg
Thank you boss for advise. Hard to come by walkable trips,btohqsg
There are orders within walkable distance (within 1km) but those are rare,btohqsg
I recommend you deliveroo. For deliveroo  you can cancel as you wish. Price is reasonable,btohqsg
For those orders I also walk to deliver even when I drive.,btohqsg
Ya if  do gf more low,btohqsg
I trying to get money back like very hardTerms and condition states that if never ever did any orders and ask for deposit back will incur $10 admin fee,btohqsg
Cannot filter the orders in my area,btohqsg
I think the rates really a bit lame for bicycle and walkersU do foodpanda walkerMacdonald‚Äôs to nearby block about 1plus km away $4-7 already and only less than 30 min,btohqsg
Maybe keep the account first if got chance convert to drivers,btohqsg
If no take any orders  will the account be freeze,btohqsg
If walker account after 1 or 2 weeks no buy lalakit bag will suspended,btohqsg
