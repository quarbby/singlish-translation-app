Fr I‚Äôm down a lot on my stocks  the faster the rate cut comes the better for me. Hopefully June they‚Äôll cut though given the current data most analysts think there‚Äôs less than a 50% chance it‚Äôll be coming that fast. Having at least 3 cuts would be good this year though,btohqsg
But surprisingly today the market is bullish (most stocks are rising) despite the inflation data released today,btohqsg
Over the medium-term  interest rates are likely to settle at a higher level than in the last cycle. Goldman Sachs economists have long argued that the neutral rate (at which the economy is at full employment  and the policy rate neither stimulates nor slows GDP growth) was not quite as low as the conventional wisdom held during the last cycle. For now  the short-run neutral rate might be higher than the long-run neutral rate because fiscal deficits are much wider than usual  resilient risk sentiment has limited the transmission from higher rates to broad financial conditions and the economy  and the most rate-sensitive sectors (housing and autos) have been constrained more by supply than demand. All these factors help the economy remain at full employment despite higher interest rates. Fed officials are likely to raise their estimates of the neutral rate over time  though by how much remains uncertain.,btohqsg
Yeah after the 2007/8 financial crisis the fed left the interest rates at a low level for too long,btohqsg
I think they learned their lesson,btohqsg
