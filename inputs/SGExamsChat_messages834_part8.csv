agreed‚Ä¶ if u feel burn out  take a break. don‚Äôt force yourself to do things. as for your teammates  maybe ask them to complete it as a grp tgt in physical settings / during a zoom call. if they r not doing anything despite reminders  warn them ur gg to mark them down fr peer eval unless they r doing their work,btohqsg
hihi I'm a sec 2 and currently in my streaming year and im not sure if i should follow my interest of taking pure hist or take pure geog since i have better grades (a1/a2),btohqsg
hallo  ultimately  it depends on your interest and not solely on results. if you have interest for the subj  you‚Äôll genuinely do btr in it than a subj whr u scored well at. pure hist and pure geog is very different from sec1 and 2 hist and geog though there are similarities. ultimately you shd consider ur interest and your results but i think interest is more important compared to results imo,btohqsg
ultimately its ur choice so choose wisely bcs it also affects ur olvls,btohqsg
hi guys those in jc can i ask when ur prelims end ?,btohqsg
mine end the week school opens then like lowkey seems kinda fast,btohqsg
did u take pure hist? can you tell me what its like?,btohqsg
but i took elect hist and its fun to learn,btohqsg
Lower sec u can anyhow wack,btohqsg
Finding the inference/message is much tricker,btohqsg
Lower sec pretty much accept anything,btohqsg
hi i took pure hist and elect geog so i can tell u how pure hist is like,btohqsg
i find pure hist manageable due to my sch history notes and mindmap. sbq is easy to score if u get the answering technique and inference right. essay writing is important as it accounts for 8m or 12m.,btohqsg
for pure hist  we learn about ww1  ww2 ( europe)  how hitler rise to power  hitler‚Äôs personality  how japan‚Äôs colonisation of power rise  reasons of ww2 ( japan)  how ww2 ended for both japan and germany  south korean war & vietnam war,btohqsg
if need take  i die alr,btohqsg
I mean...if you doing diploma in chinese studies or chinese comms maybe uh. But other than that shld be no...,btohqsg

Depending on schools  it is anything between W1 to W3 of T4. Mostly W2 with mostly MCQ papers in W2,btohqsg
wth is ppl's brains with downvoting and upvoting on r/sgexams' topics or comments,btohqsg
like why r ppl upvoting some skibidi toilet worth sarcasm that belongs to the gutters of gen alpha terrors but downvoting on the hard truths of reality  advice  suggestions etc that people have inferred to tell?,btohqsg
generally speaking from what ive been seeing on sgexams reddit vs other reddits that i expected should've been way worse than an academic-like space LOL,btohqsg
waste of time and brainpower trying to understand what goes on in others heads,btohqsg
Users on telegram upvote trolls and downvote the reality  ü•¥,btohqsg

üìà Bus and MRT fares for adult commuters are set to go up by 10 cents per trip from Dec 28  2024.https://cna.asia/4glpCTx,btohqsg

whenever i forget to bring my ezlink i just default throw $1 then get my ticket,btohqsg
i dont even know if the bus driver knows how much im suppose to pay etc,btohqsg
it's more ex than normal fares,btohqsg
yea i know  but i dont even know if by default $1 can cover the cost of the trip i take on the busses,btohqsg
if normal fare is increased to be able to cover,btohqsg
all y'all gna be screaming bloody murder,btohqsg
student fare is still pretty reasonable,btohqsg
all the time i hear ppl say  is this bus heading to X? if yes  they'll ask for cash price and then i'll see some of them take out NOTES,btohqsg
i was used to paying with coins for bus fare if using cash,btohqsg
