This card gives 1.1 miles right,btohqsg
Just pretty depressing that all the nerfs come together NOW,btohqsg
Just to double check  this is not related to amex pay at hawker right?,btohqsg
Amaze  chocolate  scb smart.. to name a few,btohqsg
To confirm  there is no expiry to these miles  and no monthly cap ?,btohqsg
No cap but it's Krisflyer miles so it has 3y expiry.,btohqsg
Ah ok. Is there transfer fee for the miles.into my krisflyer account ?,btohqsg
No. And let's read up some basic information about this card if you intend to get it.,btohqsg
no need transfer since directly earn krisflyer miles,btohqsg
wanna bet more savings account interest rates cuts coming?,btohqsg
I'm pretty new to miles. And just as I start  the nerfs come in waves,btohqsg
Welcome  all part of the game,btohqsg
How do you pay town council fee with credit card?,btohqsg
Anyone know if I use chocolate finance debit card to top up GrabPay wallet also can have the 2 max miles?,btohqsg
Just to share.Dining (Personal) = UOB KF CC  provided i had spent $800 via scoot or SQ flights.Online shopping (Shopee) = CRMCOverseas (Personal or Company trips (claimable) ) = CRMC + AmazeDining (Claimable by company) = CRMC + Amaze.welcome to have any inputs to make it better.,btohqsg
Look for your town council area  than drop a email to them requesting for cc deduction,btohqsg
Likely they will send you a form. Fill it up and submit back to them,btohqsg
UOB PPV (Dining & offline shopping)  UOB Lady (Travel related)  CRMC+Amaze (Online and overseas dining shopping)  UOB One/Trust (Grocery and house expense). Pretty standard for all,btohqsg
Just FYI  but if it works or not i'm can't confirm,btohqsg
UserHanzhenghas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no shopee link,btohqsg
Go to their website to download form to fill up & return to them.,btohqsg
I just found out that you can pay town council fees using sing post app using Chocolate card. Just did the payment and it workz,btohqsg
understand we can't use chocolate card to pay S&CC via AXS machine  what about SingPost SAM?,btohqsg
May I know how do we earn the interest from HSBC EGA account as I only manage to secure 0.05% interest for last month?,btohqsg
Did you register via sms for bonus interest?,btohqsg
Able to pay using chocolate(for now) via singpost sam app  not sure about the physical machine,btohqsg
SIngpost app? I tot there is or nets or enets available at the payment screen,btohqsg
This is HSBC ega 1% cashback  not bonus interest.,btohqsg
Can be paid via visa or mc as well,btohqsg
Do I need to register for the bonus interest? I have made deposit of $2k (salary crediting) and 5 GIRO in Feb?,btohqsg
I donâ€™t see cc payment method on my signpost app  I wait for dp from other users who can able to do that,btohqsg
Deposit 2k and make 5 trnx is activity to keep HSBC ega account eligible.For bonus interest  you need to deposit fresh fund and send sms,btohqsg
Bonus Interest Promo and Everyday+ Rewards Bonus Interest are 2 separate things,btohqsg
Seems like UOB Stash is easier if we do not have 2 EGA acc to alternate,btohqsg
Could be based on receiving entity if they allow credit card. As for CCK town council  they dont allow,btohqsg
I wonder if it is town council related :D,btohqsg
Only certain town council accepts debit ðŸ˜“,btohqsg
Anyway  i saw tax paynent under singpost app  can explore that,btohqsg
You can always alternate with another account like UOB One account or OCBC 365 account.,btohqsg
Just saw  that is just sad.. only certain towncouncil then,btohqsg
Yah but canâ€™t satisfy OCBC 365 account salary crediting condition as they donâ€™t accept own salary transfer,btohqsg
UOB one? But need credit card spend,btohqsg
For now  income tax payment  you have to use 3rd party processor with additional fees. Same goes for mcst,btohqsg
yup  managed to get one tax payment done last month. This month  back to GIRO :D,btohqsg
Have tried using CC payment at Towncouncil office. Transaction goes thro' but does not constitute as $500 spending for UOB One Account. Same goes for tuition and enrichment center payment.,btohqsg
UOB One does not include government services spending. You can use telco and insurance spending  they are counted in the spending requirement,btohqsg
I use UOB Lady together with UOB One card. When I buy airline tickets or book hotels  those will include in the spending requirement for UOB one account.,btohqsg
"Yes. Govt services like HDB mortgage  healthcare services not included. Trying various type of payment and usually I request for ""PAYWAVE"".  Insurance premium payment does work and I now have the insurance company to bill me monthly to hit the $500 spending instead of One time annual payment.",btohqsg
Payment methods differ based on what are you going to pay,btohqsg
hi  I have gotten this coupon after first 30 days but I have withdrawn all the funds. that means I can't use this coupon already?,btohqsg
