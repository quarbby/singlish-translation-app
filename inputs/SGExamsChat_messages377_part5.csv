guys which subject combi is better?,btohqsg
2 Options1. Double Pure Science (Physics + Chem) + Additional Mathematics2. Combined Science (Chem + Physics) + POA + Additional Mathematics,btohqsg
Its not a matter of whats better  it a matter of what are you looking to gain from the combi,btohqsg
i dont take POA so i cant say,btohqsg
i think it depends on whats ur interest,btohqsg
like if u think u enjoy sci alot then take double pure,btohqsg
idk what are the pre requisites for poa though,btohqsg
Depends on what u like but I'm pro doing pure sci unless UK u rly dc abt sci la,btohqsg
But like I don't take poa so idk la,btohqsg
Cuz my sch is poa is only rly pushed to ppl to either interested or like fail S2 maths,btohqsg
if ure btr in sci take sci if ure btr in math take poa?,btohqsg
my sch doesnt even hv poa HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
But iirc my friends in poa said it's q abit of memory work tho,btohqsg
but like the thing is combined sci learn 70% of pure subj plus if 1 sci is bad it can pull down ur other sci,btohqsg
mine doesnt even offer to express,btohqsg
If UK u got 1 sci that's rly cmi,btohqsg
