🎉Pika World Daily Review –24Feb 2023🎉🍏Markets recovered from days of losses💰It was a roller coaster trading day as indices swung from gains to losses and back to gains. As choppy as it can get  investors are digesting the latest economic data to predict the Fed's next move.Thursday's economic data portrayed a mixed bag of situations. First  the GDP  which showed a 2.7% economic expansion  is lower than the prior 2.9%. The labour market  on the contrary  continued to show enormous resilience as jobless claims dropped to 192 000 last week  lower than the consensus of 199 500. This isn't good news for the Fed as it tried to cool the tight labour market that had supported solid income growth and inflation.We continued to be cautiously bullish on the general economy as pockets of strength proved the thesis for a soft landing.📮What are our dishes today?🔭It is going to be a truly heavy day for economic data.At 9.30 pm  a wide range of data will be released. Most importantly  the Core PCE Price Index  the Fed's preferred inflation indicator  is likely to show growth of 0.4%  a rise from 0.3% in the prior period. This will be critical as we are seeing renewed inflation pressure in the economy  and that is likely to fuel a further headwind for stocks if it is materialized into economic reading.Personal spending on a MoM basis is also expected to climb by 1.3%  reversing its decline of 0.2%.Then at 11 pm  Michigan Consumer Sentiment for Fed will likely remain at the same level of 66.4. As a result  new home sales could increase to 620K from 616K in the previous period.Two main Fed speakers  Jefferson and Mester  will speak at 11.15 pm. Again  they may drum into the same idea of a higher for longer interest rate environment  which is now factoring into traders' expectations.It is on 24 Feb  Friday  at 9 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. We have managed to release our shorts and wait to return to regain our initial position rather than force-trading it. However  with solid dollar strength and strengthing of the bond yield  it can usher into a period of volatility once more.See you tonight as we announce the latest economic data!Pika Nat.,btohqsg
