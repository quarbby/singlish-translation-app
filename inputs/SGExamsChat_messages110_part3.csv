Meanwhile my school decided to mark lenient for prelims,btohqsg
Cb my essay was btr than some ppl still lower score,btohqsg
But almost all the As are arts students,btohqsg
P2 38/50I thought it was A secured,btohqsg
So u got like around 34/50?,btohqsg
My classmate got one just nice A,btohqsg
He dw u to get A and be complacent,btohqsg
Haha I fucking failed essay but got C,btohqsg
By fail I mean like less than 45%,btohqsg
Study template answering techniquesGuaranteed 35 or higher for every p2 exam,btohqsg
Ye ikr the problem with my school is the way they mark AQ,btohqsg
Almost everyone will get 3 marks and below,btohqsg
I nvr bank my hope on AQ,btohqsg
Even 4 marks AQ is a model AQ,btohqsg
I always aim 14-15/17 SAQ7-8 for summary,btohqsg
But they decided to be more lenient for prelims,btohqsg
Its so much easier than AQ,btohqsg
But then anyways my tutor said even with lenient marking 80% of my class like 2 marks,btohqsg
120 words for 8 marks and language level boost,btohqsg
Ye summary 10 of us full marks haha,btohqsg
Yala only hard stuff is to paraphrase it,btohqsg
*ptsd of zoo a level qns*,btohqsg
I smoked the AQ so hard,btohqsg
I dont remember my paper 2 topic anymore,btohqsg
Yea but how to smoke zoo ah,btohqsg
Burn the zoo down then got smoke haha,btohqsg
Like not conservation sia just the zoo environment for animals,btohqsg
Idk whats the booha over zoo when my year AQ the marker report flamed so many students for writing bishan train flooding,btohqsg
It’s not about conservation it’s just more about zoos itself,btohqsg
Still rmb how everyone confuse Mandai Zoo with Singapore Zoo,btohqsg
U probably have to see the whole passage,btohqsg
Most of the points is just about the animals life in the zoo,btohqsg
The problem with some people is like they kinda studied some topics then out of the blue zoo comes out lol,btohqsg
Meanwhile im just revising h2 maths,btohqsg
My H2 math was quite ez,btohqsg
Realised how rusty i am in math now,btohqsg
U should have done that in ns,btohqsg
I’m kinda revising my H2 math by helping people out in discord,btohqsg
Do u need to do math mods?,btohqsg
What yr tho?I felt that my yr was quite doable overall,btohqsg
Plus also some of the FM students also ask qn,btohqsg
But i still fked up p1,btohqsg
I threw game for p1  then i nvr study for p2,btohqsg
Then regret when i saw p2 during the exam itself,btohqsg
2018 gave a 2nd order DE but then it’s more of a application of differentiation,btohqsg
Yours is the one with alot of fmath style qns in h2 math isit,btohqsg
But syllabus change yr usually no moderation,btohqsg
Then they gave an FM definite integral formula,btohqsg
So overall 70 was prob sufficient for an A,btohqsg
The stats application qn is the CnR error square thing,btohqsg
