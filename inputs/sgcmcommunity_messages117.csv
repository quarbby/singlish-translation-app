Hi all  any recommendation for PPF? Which type is good and if it is good to have it or not,btohqsg
What are you looking to achieve from it sir?,btohqsg
thinking for easier cleaning and some scratch protection would be good,btohqsg
Only anti scratch protection is called 360 in car cams,btohqsg
I beg to diff as my ppf still good even after 2 years+,btohqsg
But yes I agree with you on the expensive portion,btohqsg
There r cheaper options. But i dont see ppf if ur gna change car every few years,btohqsg
Good for you bruh. Wait until it turns yellow 🤣,btohqsg
And don't cry when your paint falls out when peeling it off,btohqsg
👊 2 men were seen throwing punches along Still Road. 1 of them was assisted by a woman holding a stick.➡️http://bit.ly/3jyQiYmFollow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates,btohqsg
Erm if you buy cheap ppf sure,btohqsg
There's some good quality ppf films out there that peels right off,btohqsg
The yellowing also depends on where you're parking the car and is more visible on a white car usually,btohqsg
I'm not saying ppf is a must have,btohqsg
But it isn't bad if you're willing to spend on it,btohqsg
Can polish and coat a few times for the cost... Pick your poison,btohqsg
I used to do coating every year. But when switched over to ppf I didn't need to. I think 2 are different products. For long term ppf is better. For short term if you own the car less than 3 years. Maybe coating is more affordable.Bottomline money is yours. You choose.,btohqsg
Do u need to polish n wax PPF to shine?,btohqsg
PPF is literally a wrap... So no you just have to wash... But that doesn't mean it can't be scratched,btohqsg

Guys  i am looking for 1 car that can last at least 1 to 2 yrs and i am not sure if this car is worth looking at.  I really need your sound advise as i have never driven a conti car before.  My reasons as follows:1. left 1yr and 5 mths  (I need2. High ARF ( which i can use it to step to another car)3. Why this car as i did a filter search in sgcarmart and this is the only car that appears that left with 2 yrs or lesser and the lowest depreciation. (i filter 10K to 13K)4. this car looks good and is diesel so FC is great and is MPV (though i dont really need 7 seater.)Last reason if i raise the filter by another 1K of depreciation  i have other choices like Nissan Selphy.  Same monthly repayment but this car ARF is lower far more lower.Guys please do help me out here and if this conti car is really not worth considering then i will move on.../,btohqsg
Don’t think already just go with your,btohqsg
2. why high arf?  if the car is dirt cheap you can save more over the next 1-2years also...,btohqsg
the fella keep coming back and asking about citroen and renault.... why sia,btohqsg
Like for me not worth it ah,btohqsg
He needs to trust his Instinct Loh,btohqsg
his intinct tells him to buy citroen,btohqsg
i dun really must buy citroen... but just that this search came up...,btohqsg
I choose this cos low dep and high arf,btohqsg
High arf is only advance payment,btohqsg
There is perhaps a reason why it is so?,btohqsg
and you will spend more money when the car has parts that need replacing,btohqsg
i took the advise the last time u guys mentioned thats why i discuss with my wife and we decided to go for any car that has less than 2 yrs so this car came into the search after all the filters,btohqsg
Make sure ppi gao gao lor,btohqsg
Hearsay french car not as nice as french pastry,btohqsg
Who advised you go Citroen!! I go pull his ears,btohqsg
ok guys i got it.. i wont go for conti.,btohqsg
But French accent make all girl feel… undesertlike,btohqsg
you tell him go see Citroen ah?,btohqsg
i rather buy VW than citroen,btohqsg
no need bother looking at arf... just look at depre will do,btohqsg
this car left with 1 yr and 3 mths,btohqsg
this car dep 14K is it ok?,btohqsg
You use 1 year then sell before scrap,btohqsg
I need the ARF to jump to another car so that i can down more.. isnt that the theory?,btohqsg
Get a low depre car is better,btohqsg
kia and hyundai good choices also  some cars cheaper than that,btohqsg
Is it me or is this so chio,btohqsg
Wah why you buy tele premium,btohqsg
SG carmart got no more listing for less than 2 yrs,btohqsg

You sure it’s the right Aaron?,btohqsg
Those buying Conti from C&C please be warn. My experience with them not very good. My Citroen C4 Picasso engine keeps “misfiring “ as they claimed and kept tweaking on the software throughout warranty period. Fellow Citroen I know shared C&C made repaired work on similar issues right after warranty period  of course with charges and downtime ! Think it’s not right as they should resolve within warranty period and not after just to charge customers. Lack of good faith.,btohqsg
so $5 nowhere near enough to eat nasi padang,btohqsg
Next MONTH I TAKE IT BACK HAHA,btohqsg
Change to new car before the warranty period ends,btohqsg
Arf for ice car higher than hybrid? So if end of the 10yr scrap  the arf take back for hybrid is far lower than for ice?,btohqsg
theoretically yes  because the hybrid or electric cars gets cevs rebate on the arf. up to 20k less i believe,btohqsg
u take back less  but u also paid less. in fact it is better for you.e.g both ice and the hybrid cars cost 100k and arf value is 20k. but hybrid entitles to 10k rebateice u pay 100k and get back 10k (50% of 20k)  depre = 9khybrid u pay 90k and get back 5k (50% of 20-10k)  depre  = 8.5k,btohqsg
i believe that is the calculation,btohqsg
But I believe 1st buyer can always earn the relief by placing a premium when selling in 2nd hand car market,btohqsg
I did. Just when warranty ends. Guess what  no dealer wanna take in locally. Done when French cars. Also with C&C no more! Lousy after sales service!,btohqsg
in an ideal world  the engineers are Germans.. french as lovers.. italians as chef...,btohqsg
honestly  french car not popular in Singapore  so most dealers wont take them in,btohqsg

yes but if u compare the cars by depre  then its already based on the price after the relief. the seller doesnt really pocket that 10k savings.e.g. if u paid 90k or 8.5 depre for the hybird. after 5 years  the price guide would be about 47.5k?,btohqsg
Will road hogging get fine / dermis points?,btohqsg
You drive on lane 1 at speed limit  no issue... Only kena high beam and poke,btohqsg
Not on the 1st 2 lanes that is for sure,btohqsg

Aiyo why you think like this..Sometime customer never input unit number. Call customer but they never answered. Call platform cso  cso order rider to throw away. Because of food poisoning  it's better to throw.Like Food catering  food must consume within 2hr or risk food poisoning.,btohqsg
It was discussed on kiss 92  some phv drivers called in and shared some riders to book a few platform  tada gojek  comfort grab  and take whichever car that came first and refused to cancel..,btohqsg
Nope I saved my address and still kena twice. I was at home  and the rider still left the food at the carpark next to a bin,btohqsg
He made no effort to contact me through the app,btohqsg
Their app recently has some issues  rider cannot see address.,btohqsg

GV motorworks paid SGCM for it ah,btohqsg
Can sgcm legally promote $0 downpayments,btohqsg
Like yes dealers put it in their listings and that's on them,btohqsg
I thought 0 dp is illegal,btohqsg
But on sgcm posts if it's highlighted  that's coming from sgcm no?,btohqsg
Yes there is a grey area to get around it and how it's done,btohqsg
But I'm pretty sure it's illegal to promote fraudulent activities,btohqsg
Im pretty sure MAS knows what is going on,btohqsg
like alot things they know is on-going  but its not strictly enforced,btohqsg
Plus MAS ruling for 30dp 70 loan applies mostly to the commercial banks no? Some of this dealers is in house loan,btohqsg
Yes of course they know sir,btohqsg
It's a bit hard not to know what's going on with anything in Singapore,btohqsg
Also it applies to any finance company  merchant bank and full bank,btohqsg
And only these and licensed moneylenders can technically give out loans,btohqsg
Think so  like promoting listing on Carousell.,btohqsg
You need to bribe them with nasi Padang first,btohqsg
Really? Maybe never enforce. FB many such ads. 0% down. 1.99% interest  phv packages etc.,btohqsg
Actually idk whats the rationale for max 70% loan,btohqsg
Was there a huge influx of bad debts caused by car loans prior to the ruling?,btohqsg
Sorry ah i was quite young back then didnt really follow the news,btohqsg
So that people do not make financially irresponsible decisions,btohqsg
Ngl.. some ppl in life deserves a lesson abt money tho.. but oh wells. At least i think its 👍,btohqsg
TDSR alot of young couples has high debt payments per mth which affect their chance to get housing loan,btohqsg
That's why I saddle myself with a housing loan before I bought my first car,btohqsg
i mean if HDB wasn't priced so high  the loan amount wont be that much..,btohqsg
Can. Got tourist there sure don’t mind trying 🤣,btohqsg
Consider very cheap already.If you see China and HK... At least over 80% own their house.If you see recent new in Australia.  There are no house available to rent.,btohqsg

lol in short Diesel burns more slowly than Gasoline  but has higher energy content. that's why it is more cost efficient,btohqsg
Diesel has high capacity for work  that's why heavy vehicles all diesel,btohqsg
Gasoline used in motorsports because it burns much easier  and you can achieve higher RPM = higher rate of work = higher BHP = higher acceleration,btohqsg
