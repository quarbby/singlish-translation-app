No equity I got 20 cents on the dollar back in UBS stock,btohqsg
Hopefully we don’t enter a secular bear market soon,btohqsg
What’s the code for it ah  I can’t find sry,btohqsg
VUAA > VOO purely because lower withholding,btohqsg
and VUAA can buy fractional now,btohqsg
I wanted to buy Apple after earnings cos I thought it would dip but Tim Cook announced share buy back and a bit of their Ai strategy and it went up,btohqsg
I got money I want to invest I just buy,btohqsg
Now I also feel that Apple stock is too high  not a good deal anymore,btohqsg
and carry on w my day,btohqsg
How much have you been up since you started trading,btohqsg
Idk if I should just quit and wait for a crash,btohqsg
U wan YOY or just since inception,btohqsg
I've been waiting years for a crash,btohqsg
I mean I intended to sell at around 195 had I bought it but now it’s 190,btohqsg
since inception v low cause I yolo'd too hard,btohqsg
Oh so both of yall play safe,btohqsg
And you lost a lot at the start?,btohqsg
U are talking to a guy who did short sell biotech,btohqsg
but since inception is still about 5%,btohqsg
tried n tested 3 stock portfolio ngl,btohqsg
I put in 3k sgd and would’ve actually lost more if not for Webull giving vouchers and free fractional Nividia shares,btohqsg
C6L is just for the lols,btohqsg
and the 38¢ dividend is the cherry on top,btohqsg
been wanting to take it srsly for like 2 yrs now but lazy lol,btohqsg
What made you choose that instead of VOO or SPy,btohqsg
one month in that new portfolio  1.2% so far lol,btohqsg
Lol she actually ok tho she js weak,btohqsg
By the time we reach ambulance alr there,btohqsg
How does the tax work btw,btohqsg
I never noticed any expenses being deducted from my account,btohqsg
U trade off liquidity and fill tho,btohqsg
how long u gonna test it?,btohqsg
say Nvidia give 10¢ dividend  you'll only see 7¢ in your account,btohqsg
it's not deducted on your end,btohqsg
So the tax is only on the dividend?,btohqsg
liquid enough for a passive investor like myself,btohqsg
however long I don't need that money  or another app gives better rates,btohqsg
ya  which is why I prefer stock buyback for US stocks,btohqsg
Then fill ig u do a Limit or Market?,btohqsg
no withholding on US side  then no capital gains tax on SG side aso,btohqsg
do u invest w ur cpf oso?,btohqsg
Like if VOO has 0.03% expenses how does the deduction work,btohqsg
Yeah u are getting fucked on fill,btohqsg
unless you're using some shitty ass investing app la,btohqsg
PFOF is another issue all tgt the main issue is the fill will almost always be on ask,btohqsg
only an issue on your mainstream apps such as your webull  tiger  moomoo,btohqsg
and wtv other weird name trading apps,btohqsg
