hello friends  firstly I just want to apologise for all the frustrations that has been going on.I understand that the rules and guidelines that has been applied recently might not be consistent  and that has caused considerable unhappiness. since day 1  I have advocated for the telegram groups to be a conducive place to discuss anything that's on topic for the group  and I think the team have the same vision.when we moderate  we strive to be transparent  and as much as possible  consistent and objective. we're not perfect  but we'll try our best in the time that we're online. in view of this  the moderator team has been shuffled  and I hope that this will allow us to continue growing this group.additionally  I recognise that as the groups mature and evolve  it might be due time to properly review the rules and guidelines of our telegram groups  and I want to say that we will look at them soon once the team gets the chance to sit down together.in the meantime  good luck for the remaining examinations that you have  and please feel free to tag me or any of the other mods if there are any issues :),btohqsg

Nice  rarely take bus these days,btohqsg
im the opposite üòÅi rarely take MRT,btohqsg
sry guys  MRT is usually a choice i avoid,btohqsg
even if the bus fare rates are burning more,btohqsg
i don't like mrt+ mrt station crowds as compared to bus,btohqsg
even during peak hours or holiday periods,btohqsg
istg even neighborhood bus routes are getting better treatment as compared to MRTs,btohqsg
I can't stand buses that have many stops,btohqsg
and also mrt that stops for longer time at every station like the East West Line,btohqsg
i prefer over that over mrts instead LOOLi usually just bring along a fully charged 60k mAh portable charger  wallet and phone for an entire day of bus rides (from punggol to yishun to bugis to sembawang/woodlands/jurong point back to home),btohqsg
