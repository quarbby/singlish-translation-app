Hi all anyone knows repainting car to non-stock colour does it affect trade-in/resale value haha,btohqsg
Depends on the color as well. Some are more acceptable than others,btohqsg
you must never buy car of differentr color than factory original. the inside is impossible to change. do you trust others take out the stuff to spray the color?,btohqsg
For me it really depends on where it was resprayed  some shops really do it well  even better than the manufacturer/dealership at times,btohqsg
are they going to remove the components inside engine compartments to spray paint?,btohqsg
How to prepare your car for wet weatherAmong all  having a good set of tyres or tyres in optimal condition is the most important during wet weather!üëâüèª React with ‚ù§Ô∏è if you agree!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
Oh no  not an engine out paintjob,btohqsg
that is for exterior color. when i did the restoration  the exterior is sprayed with fantastic paint job. better than original.,btohqsg
For those  I don't think there's any shop in Singapore that can do it really well,btohqsg
In other parts of the world there are great shops out there like chartwell in the UK  etc.,btohqsg
but never the inside. i would never allow that to happen. this painter actually remved the fusebox in order to paint it. btu when he put it back he did not fasten the wires properly resulting in melted relays!,btohqsg
They're even approved by manufacturers for bodyshop repairs,btohqsg
took me a long time to figure out why,btohqsg
so how are they going to spray the inside without taking out the stuff in engine bay?,btohqsg
supposed you wanna change color from white to red. how would it look?,btohqsg
They don't spray the inside that's the issue,btohqsg
Or if they do  not a great job,btohqsg
Which brings me back to  the key thing is who resprayed it,btohqsg
how can they not spray the inside if you change color? spraying outside would look weird,btohqsg
nothing to do with who. letting them dismantle and reassemble back is high risk,btohqsg
They spray the doors and the door jambs and boot jambs but not the engine bay,btohqsg
Haha i was thinking like respraying a less popular? Silver colour with another stock colour like blue or something hence just wondering if dealer will rip off based on respray,btohqsg
Yes it is  that's why you need a good shop who knows what they're doing,btohqsg
"Do what you feel you would like to see. End of the day  it's your car that you see everyday and you should be happy with its looks. If you are looking at reselling your car soon then best to keep it stock  otherwise no point in looking at it's ""resale value"" to do anything cosmetic for the long run.",btohqsg
if everything based on logic and being prudent.. nobody owns a car liao haha,btohqsg
If you buy a property  thinking of reselling it years down the road  it doesn't mean you wouldn't do a renovation and have built in furniture or carpentry because you may sell it next time isnt it. You use your car on a daily  it should be something that you would look back when you park and know you like how it looks. Be it a respray  a wrap or whatever you add on to it  as long as you like it!,btohqsg
I just met a flash flood. While my car drives pass it  it started to vibrate badly and have that choke up effect. Any experts experience it before,btohqsg
Water went into air intake.Pray never going into engineüò±,btohqsg
Update to shareFinally went to workshop this morning. Mechanic suspect throttle body and air flow sensor. Cleaned both and rpm stable at about 800. Let's see for next 2 weeks as fault does not come always,btohqsg
You open and check your air filter. Is it wet?Try let the engine dry up. Don't drive 1-2day maybe?,btohqsg
Thanks. I manage to reach the service Center for a check.,btohqsg
How deep was e flash flood,btohqsg
