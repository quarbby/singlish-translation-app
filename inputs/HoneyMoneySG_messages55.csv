In general  the flow is like this  but not always.. Like my company's group insurance  if the final bill is higher than the letter of guarantee  they will pay or reimburse after the final bill is settled through personal insurance  medisave  own pay... and it take monthssssss... so if you don't have sufficient personal insurance and medisave  this may affect your personal cash flow  if you have to pay using your own money first.,btohqsg
Yup recently my sister fracture her foot and needed surgery  managed to use personal hospital insurance that the insurer pay bulk of the cost first.,btohqsg
yes the benefit of having good personal insurance..,btohqsg
I withdraw on the spot üôÇ,btohqsg
They know already  there are hundreds of employees looking into this,btohqsg
So we tell to our personal insurance that a portion have been claimed to company insurance?,btohqsg
But you can‚Äôt make $   just to cover the expenses,btohqsg
CI is only 1x payment and terminate the policy  except for policy with multiple CIs  correct?,btohqsg
all is processed at the back end by the hospital.. Hospital will make the necessary claim to the respective insurance based on the information that you provided upon admission.. which insurance to claim first etc.. if you need to pay through cash or medisave  hospital will also tell you.,btohqsg
Oh Ci works once only per insurance?,btohqsg
yes there are various types of CI policy...,btohqsg

To play safe  use other bank account üòÄ,btohqsg
Last year I did a Medisave & co insurance all settle by hospital,btohqsg
Guess need ask insurance more info üòû pay more again,btohqsg
My last claim with Ntuc income for my mother  I pay everything  then manually submit to Income after get the bill from sgh,btohqsg
Not all companies have multi CIs policy  yes  much more expensive,btohqsg
Oh mine was never need to forks outside anything,btohqsg
better to get advise from independent financial adviser to be more objective.. if you go to a specific insurance company  you will not get a full picture what is avaialble in the market,btohqsg
Maybe due to mine co Insurance,btohqsg
Actually is not bad as you can earn benefits from credit card üòÄ,btohqsg
if your mum has provided letter of guarantee from NTUC income prior admission  by right  no need to do that...,btohqsg
No  we call the insurance agent  but she do not said to ask for letter  and said just claim later after bill processed ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Ya mine got the letter so maybe that the reason bo nedd pay first,btohqsg
how long did you get your money back from NTUC income? It is known to take its own sweet time in making reimbursement,btohqsg
is razorpay / sgh medical bill counted for uob one eligible spend,btohqsg
2-3 weeks after submit the claim,btohqsg

Hi all if lets say i speend 200 on citi rewards as non qualifying and earned 0.4 mpd so i still have 1k 4 mpd or i have 800 4 mpd?,btohqsg
When an insured(patient) admitted to hospital:1). Hospital will present the insured with few options on a form: Claim from which insurance companies if you have multiple insurances  pay by your credit card or by cash. You decide which insurance company you want to claim from by signing the form.2). Hospital will contact insurance company and request letter of guarantee from the insurance company specified by you. The letter of guarantee will guarantee up to certain amount depends on the insurance plan you bought. Ie. $20k or $30k3). Upon patient discharged and final bill issued by hospital  if the amount is less than guarantee amount  insurance company will settle the amount with hospital directly.4). If the bill is more than the guarantee amount  insurance company will help to settle the amount up to the guarantee amount.5). The insured(patient) has to settle the remaining balance on bill *asap* and submit the receipt showing it is fully paid to insurance company before X days after discharged. . ie 30 days.6). If the insured *did not* submit the receipt before X days  it is up to insurance company to decide if can reimburse the amount to you. Insurance company has the right not to reimburse the insured if the insured violate the TnC. i.e. did not submit receipt before X days.,btohqsg
Hi community  to maintain your uob one account 5% interest  is it better to use uob lady solitaire card VS uob evol  since there is the 6mpd promotion now?,btohqsg
Only Grab wallet  no other wallets?,btohqsg
Can you pair uob lady solitaire card with instarem amaze  then select travel category for the lady card  and just use the amaze card to pay for everything locally?,btohqsg
Pay for travel related locally then 6mpd. If used on Other non travel related  you will be better if using other 4mpd cards.,btohqsg
Travel category means only travel related expenses like hotels  airlines etc,btohqsg
Amaze does not change mcc code. It merely converts transactions from offline to online.,btohqsg
Like what can be travel related locally,btohqsg
You can Google ‚ÄúWhich MCCs are included in the UOB Lady‚Äôs Card ‚ÄúTravel‚Äù category‚Äù,btohqsg

Hi folks for HSBC TravelOne Credit Card welcome bonus for the $800 min spending within 30days. it states retails purchases. what does this mean?anything is consider (except those on exclusion list?),btohqsg
Yes.. But still better than enquire with a particular insurance company. My point is the benefit of having an independent financial adviser.. But again whether you can trust your independent FA or not.,btohqsg
The starting point of my answer is also from someone whom I assumed doesn't not know much of various insurance products.,btohqsg
In Singapore‚Äôs context  the big 3 have their benefits.Using phones as an example  maybe you don‚Äôt use iPhone or Samsung  maybe you prefer oppo or Xiaomi or Huawei  but are they necessary better in terms of support,btohqsg
Yes.. This is assuming that you know which phone your prefer,btohqsg
yes from what i read also it means retail transactions minus those on that exclusion listüòÖ,btohqsg

How much is the service fee,btohqsg
there is a cap of $120k spend for the current promo.. so try to use 2 humans,btohqsg

Only can link with MC  visa can't,btohqsg
Get it online. Singlife(was aviva)  is affordable . Claims are simple too.2 factors for consideration1) affordable premium2) claims experience,btohqsg

Hi all  anyone using Adult Monthly Travel Card $128? I‚Äôm wondering if can pair the travel card with credit card (e.g hsbc) and points/cashback from the credit cardü§î,btohqsg
Just do search above. I guess many answer. And probably be bad newsüòÇ,btohqsg
Citi payall has a limit of $120K for the bonus payout. So for $200K  you'll have to find 2 citibank cc holders. That also means your $200K bill can be split into 2 payments. Lastly the citi payall amount is capped at 95% of your permanent credit limit. So if you want to make a citi payall payment of $100K  your permanent credit limit must be roughly $106K.,btohqsg
Hello  just want to check for DBSWMCC or any miles card in general - If I pay for my online shopping (Eur website) in SGD  will it be considered local spend or foreign spend? (I think is call dynamic currency conversion(?)),btohqsg

Spend $350 and get either $300 back (visa) or $350 (amex). Approval date would be based on the approval email,btohqsg
In digibank  go to more and select application status (under apply). There you‚Äôll see when it was approves,btohqsg

Hi allI actually wanted to ask a question related to overseas spending over long periods.I am currently overseas due to contracted work venture but I am earning back in SGD with cpf contribution paying taxes as per normal.I have the local credit cards  and local bank accounts to where I am situated as well as Singapore credit cards and bank accounts. So time to time I use platforms like wise to convert sgd into the local currency for living.However I was thinking of consolidating majority of my overseas expenditure such as groceries   petrol   utility bills and all those stuff for living as per normal overseas.I currently have the trust card andamaze card but I have not used the instarem amaze card at all.I am not sure it would be wise to do so instead of using the local overseas credit cards and bank accounts that I have as well.First thing first the CASHBACK overseas cards are not more than 2%.Anyone has such experiences? Thank you in advance,btohqsg

HSBC Revo card... Where do I check the bill statement for the miles point accumulated?,btohqsg
Hello  saw someone asked a qn on using cpf/cashto pay for housing. I actually did a calculation (not sure if I calculated correctly)However  based on the calculation  I think its more worth to use cash to pay for house and transfer your OA amount to SA unless you can get a return of > 4% for your cash.If you pay using OA then top up to SA (you are getting 4% interest but you have to repay 2.5% accrued interest back to your own cpf so effectively you are just getting 1.5%(?)) I understand that accrued interest is paying the interest that you could have earned if you did not touch the CPF  back to your account.If you pay using cash  you can transfer OA to SA and get 4% interest.I did a quick calculation (not sure if im correct) but assuming i took a 230k loan for 25 years  the difference when im 55:If I used cpf:OA: $750k (CPF used for house +Accrued interest + my OA amount)Breakdown of $750kCPF Amount used: $450k (principal + interest)Accrued interest: $220k (I used basic calculation instead of compounding to make things simpler)OA amount : $80kIf I didn't use cpf:SA: $1.2m (based on 4%)Initial amount about $120k  OA contribution per month $18k for 28 years (i'm 27 this year)There is a $450k difference.Any thoughts on this?üòÖ,btohqsg
For uob's lady card  to accumulate the points must it be under those travel merchants listed in the list or we can charge during travel fair too?,btohqsg
Hi  what card should I use in Australia?,btohqsg
Hi  I have ocbc 365  ocbc titanium rewards  and citibank cash back plus  and instarem. How to use my card to get the most benefit?,btohqsg
i think another thought/perspective to consider is - when do u want your retirement cash flow to kick in? Some would prefer to retire at 40 with 2k/mth vs retiring at 65 with 5k/mth (from a bigger portfolio  eg from that extra 450k difference). ‚ÄòWorth‚Äô is subjective since it depends on ur investment time horizon  financial goals and also how much u value time freedom. For some  1 year time freedom may be worth more than 450k hahaPersonally i feel 4% is fairly easy to beat unless u‚Äôre risk adverse.,btohqsg
If pay cash it is coming from your taxed income. If pay OA it is untaxed income. Also top up of MA/SA/SRS also got deduction. Think depends which aspect you are trying to maximise.,btohqsg
I tried transfering money to my moomoo account through the DDA fast transfer but doesnt get through. Is it cos its a weekend? I just opened my account.,btohqsg
I have booked a year end with travel agent. Still have a balance of 20K to pay up. Whickind of payment or card u guys think can I get the mos rebate?,btohqsg
Personally for me  I think 55 is quite a good age to retire and by then I will have about more than $700k that i can take out from CPF SA anytime. (I haven't include my monthly SA contribution . FRS for 2051 is $452k).SA is kinda risk free (only risk is if they change the 4%)It's true 4% is a relatively easy yield to hit but not for all.,btohqsg
So would you recommend topping up $8000 to SA and the rest to be paid by cash? Or still stand by full amount OA?I can still top up to SA $8k and pay by cash.The only con that I think of using cash is that my $ in SA are locked up till 55.. So if i need $ before 55  i can't touch my cpf.,btohqsg
It depends on which travel agent  some travel agents can earn more miles  some travel agent use monkey mcc which you won‚Äôt earn maximum benefits..,btohqsg
yup. Many many things can also change from 27 to 55. Heck  even my FI number changed multiple times over the last 4 years when i started my FIRE journey due to different perspectives on $. For ur case  I guess it‚Äôs a question of liquidity over the next 30 years vs ‚Äòrisk-free‚Äô returns if put into SA.Personally i would still leverage on using my CPF despite potentially having a bigger portfolio in the future since i value cashflow more than money being ‚Äòstuck‚Äô.,btohqsg
Anyone know if moomoo only accept top up of funds via same name account?,btohqsg
Yes. Or else think u money laundering,btohqsg
May I know  what about the video where Chris mention about not topping up more than $15000?,btohqsg
Confused by the reserved amount üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
Personally I‚Äôm doing 100% CPF  then top up MA then SA $8k  then the balance above that to SRS to invest (2x tax deduction overall). At least till hit FRS. I would say depends on your circumstances and if the house is a place to live or an investment. Depends how far away you are from 55. I‚Äôm Ang Moh PR with local wife/kids so my views on this might not be normal. My objective is not being forced to sell to fund retirement and no interest to get landed etc in SG.,btohqsg
What is the next best saving account that pays good interest yield and do not require salary crediting? (Exclude UOB one and HSBC EGA). Any higher than CIMB fast/star saver at 3.5% till end dec.,btohqsg
Hi  Im buying aircon on shopee worth $3000. Which card is best to use?,btohqsg
Citi rewards card can use for shopee?,btohqsg
$15k is just a ballpark figure. The whole idea is that SA top-ups (included compounded interests) for tax relief purposes are reserved and cannot be shielded at age 55.So given that at age 55  CPF rules also mandate that the first $40k cannot be shielded  this $15k is just computed from the breakeven whereby your SA top-ups (including 4% compounded interests) equate to $40k at age 55. All this comes with a big assumption that shielding hack is not plugged by CPF  and CPF rules do not change.,btohqsg
Yes  but the bonus point is cap at 1k spending,btohqsg
I see .. what a waste.If i use amex truecashback only 1.5% about $50,btohqsg
Hsbc advance will do as well,btohqsg
2.5 percent for 2k spending. Cap at 2.8k spend. Get 1 percent more if u fulfill the ega acct criteria,btohqsg
Use Digitbot method to check the Shopee mcc code if you plan to earn high miles. If the mcc code does not fall within the category  you earn less/base miles. Shopee uses multiple mcc codes n we won‚Äôt know which one Shopee uses for your transaction.,btohqsg

May i check if its possible to use UOB TMRW app to buy T Bill? So far only see SGS Bonds available in the app,btohqsg
Oic... Meaning CC payment month+ 1 month  then will see the miles point.,btohqsg
at the top of the 360 acc when u login  there are 3 info regarding salary  avg savings and one more info. u can see there to track,btohqsg
No need to pay accrued interest of Oa if you not sell the HDB,btohqsg
To me  it's all about discipline. Even the safest T-bill is now earning more than 2.5% OA. So if you want to maintain money in your OA for your next property purchase  the solution is to use CPF to pay now  and do a housing refund later when your cash yield drops. If you do not intend to purchase any more property  just transfer to SA.Considering all scenarios  using cash to pay now is the worst option  unless you are the type that cannot tolerate the temptation of seeing cash on hand.,btohqsg
Another consideration also is that once you transfer to SA and hit FRS  you no longer have the option of getting tax reduction via SA top-ups.,btohqsg

May I know how much is the fee that Citibank charges when u use Citi Payall to pay income tax?,btohqsg
For HSBC TravelOne card  when would the sign up bonus 20k KF miles equivalent be awarded? From the T&Cs  it indicates it would be awarded within 90 days... but the credit card fee payment (a promotional criteria for eligibility) would presumably come only after that (eg 1 year later?). So how would HSBC know if someone fulfils the eligibility criteria for the reward?,btohqsg
Credit card fee happens within the first month u get it,btohqsg
First year isn't waived  so you'll get the bill for the first annual fee shortly after ur card is approved,btohqsg
This guide helps to answer your question.. Basically you can't use CITI payall as if like giro payment,btohqsg
Can set to recurring every month. Only thing is you need to make sure you payment goes to IRAS before the deduction date every month  ie 6th of the month.One thing I am not sure though is the current 2.2 miles promo ends 20 Aug 2023. So for citi payall set up before that  do the payouts which happen after Aug 2023 get the 2.2 bonus miles too?,btohqsg

New or old doesn't matter. New users  ie never use citi payall before gets a further $50 grab voucher. But pls note that to be entitled for the 2.2 miles you need to charge minimum of $8K to citi payall to the same card before 20 Aug 2023,btohqsg

I'm greedy I want the cash coupon too...üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
No. Sounds like what someone impersonating as a scam group is offering,btohqsg
This 5.8% only for new user or existing user also entitled?,btohqsg
Both  as long as you meet the t&c,btohqsg
So how to get the 5.8% from moomoo? Simply just put money into cash plus? For existing users,btohqsg
Actually now I have much better opportunity for other asset classes 5.8% no longer attractive to me. But I am just waiting for forex before moving my funds overseas.,btohqsg
make sure you have the coupon and opted in.,btohqsg
Yah....I've the same concerns as I wasn't able to reconcile the transactions on the app and those on my credit card statements... So I've learnt to let go  as long as it's all reasonable... Even for visa cards  which post daily transactions  I can't reconcile them....,btohqsg
If only this group had existed 20 yrs ago I would have been a millionaire now...üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Must make 5 buy trades right?,btohqsg
From t&c looks like after you deposit you have 30 days to make five buy trades. Maybe just sweep up some bluechip stocks....,btohqsg
Banks stocks look good to me some are showing signs of trend reversal...,btohqsg
Just buy the Fullerton Moneymarket fund will do,btohqsg

Wow. Who ask this question first. First time heard electricity also need installment. The person ask must be super jialat in finance now.,btohqsg
Where do u hear/see that the electricity bill can be paid in installments?Dun believe everything u see/hear/smell on the www,btohqsg
Make partial payment loh. That's what I do to prevent late payment fees,btohqsg
That's y I am asking. Cos I heard it and I dunno how it's done,btohqsg
Dunno I don't have problem paying I just don't feel like paying in full there's a difference,btohqsg

I personally feel Tbills best for now and the amount don't get locked in for long. other options higher risk so might not be what you looking for since you mentionedsafe,btohqsg
Ega also earn 1% with egiro?,btohqsg

Anyway I have just found out moomoo the 5.8% promo and all initial promo is a scam. I called to CS and they told me I didn't qualify based on the T&C fine print. Because they intentionally made is very complicated to qualify. And they won't tell you that you didn't qualify until you ask them üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
So I will take all my money out. Fuck them...,btohqsg
"Need to click some stupid coupon to ""activate"" promo before injecting fresh funds. If you do it after you need to inject fresh funds x2",btohqsg
Oh and you needed to do it yesterday by 23:59 because that is the deadline to qualify,btohqsg
Could be a MCC thing.. saw it appear as govt before when i last checked in heymax,btohqsg
For 5.8% not worth the hassle since I can make much more easier elsewhere,btohqsg
Why no qualify? I also got money inside but they dont show the coupon used once subscription is made  dont appreciate this non-transparency sia,btohqsg
I told the CS I don't trust their verbal either send me b&w to say qualify or I withdraw every cent. They said they can't send emails. Everything is intentionally opaque,btohqsg
And I even clarified with the moomoo staff for previous promo but suddenly they back office tell me I didn't meet their t&c after holding funds for 3 mths....,btohqsg
Technically the whatsapp chat itself should serve as black and white no? Also.. quite curious how u know u not qualified for 5.8%  u calculate ah o_o,btohqsg
I talked to the staff during seedly fest for previous promo. The WhatsApp tells you the condition for qualification but didn't tell you if you meet it and actually qualify. There is going to be some step you missed for them to disqualify you,btohqsg
Moomoo mah. How to milk the cow if everything is so clear üòÇ,btohqsg
This has been the requirement for all coupon cashback/rewards in tiger n moomoo since day 1. The whole thing is not user friendly. Usually I go on-site  during event n handover my hp to staff to help me to perform the tasks. So far no issue to me.,btohqsg
CS told me I didn't click some coupon to active before depositing funds,btohqsg
The CS said something about net value or something I didn't understand. Which means your account value must keep going up you can't withdraw and reinject funds to qualify. Very confusing and all by design.,btohqsg
wah dangerous to hand over phone,btohqsg
But like I said I don't have time to jump thru their stupid hoops so I'm out. Good luck for those who qualify though,btohqsg
I was watching what the staff pressed on the phone  so it is safe.,btohqsg
I am going to move my cash to overseas property. More straightforward way to earn money why should I pay a lousy broker help me earn money? Especially someone as cunning as the PRCs,btohqsg
Btw I also work for a broker and I don't play these stupid tricks. If you want genuine investment opportunities can DM me.,btohqsg
I will likely delete my moomoo account after my funds are out. 0 trust in them already,btohqsg

That day moomoo events got lots of ppl?,btohqsg

.... U always post some weird question.... Not sure u joking or serious...,btohqsg
Anybody uses this before? Gotten the cash back?,btohqsg
Hi just to check.. if I deposit accumulate amount of 3k  and I deposit into cash plus  do I get the sea share as per moomoo promotion. I can split the deposit into cash plus into 3 transaction. Do I qualify or I need to trade stock ?,btohqsg
# Buy trade is defined as the action of buying of stocks  ETFs or funds only. Selling of stocks  ETFs or funds is not considered as a buy trade. The minimum trade amount per transaction needs to be at least S$1.https://www.moomoo.com/sg/support/topic5_128?from_platform=4&lang=en-us&platform_langArea=sg&global_content=%7B%22promote_id%22%3A13643%2C%22sub_promote_id%22%3A14%7D,btohqsg
Is the cash plus consider a buy trade ,btohqsg
Cash plus is a grey area  I would just buy 3x stocks/etf to qualify and be safe with it,btohqsg
Yes according to Moomoo back office. But i wont take their word for it too,btohqsg
I have 0 trust in anything they say  better get black and white from them. Even still they will find a way to flip-flop,btohqsg
To get the 5.8% p.a.  must apply at this promotion page firsthttps://invest.sg.moomoo.com/58nationalday,btohqsg

Oh seems like no need to click on cash voucher then  and click on deposit will do.,btohqsg
you can call or chat with them too to confirm,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Haha  this thing is a bit troublesome. Like not really worth the effort for 1 month. Bcos I am existing cashplus user.,btohqsg

HSBC revolution can I use to buy NTUC voucher to clock the minium 1000 spending?,btohqsg
yes get 10x points  but there is no min spend,btohqsg
Whats the pros for hsbc revolution? I feel like canceling this card ü§î,btohqsg
Give life an extra spark with up to 10X Reward points. that's equivalent to 4 miles or 2.5% cashback for every dollar you spend.,btohqsg
Ty for sharing :) but what if I compare it w the uob lady card (w the right category),btohqsg
Lady have only restricted 1 or 2 choices. Revo can have more choices. Once you use it on daily expenses  you will find Revo more flexible,btohqsg
if I have an upcoming $8k hotel payment (not online)  unable to split payments  any suggestions on which card to use?,btohqsg

hmm but that's 1% cash rebate... if i were to use UOB Amex  could get 1.7%. was thinking if i should use DBS Altitude or UOB Amex Cashback,btohqsg
Depends u want to lump sum 8k out or u want to 1k+ per mth for 6 mths,btohqsg
Can we use Stripe  Shopify  or Square to bind credit cards in Singapore? Thanks.,btohqsg

Some bank acct miles in $5 block some is ‚Ç¨1 dollar block,btohqsg
Link to amaze for citireward to get 10x point,btohqsg
10x points only for shoes/bags/clothes/department store,btohqsg
Gpay at shoes/bags/clothes/department store earns 10x points,btohqsg
UOB $5 blockDBS $3 I think... based on their rewards recognition factor,btohqsg
Hi all  Im watching HoneyMoney videos and there were mentioning that UOB One is good but for those without credit card spending  OCBC is better  why so?From UOB's website  doesn't UOB One's spending includes debit card spending?,btohqsg
What if no credit card spending just the salary crediting? What‚Äôs the percentage interest üòÇ,btohqsg
No use. Minimum spending comes first.,btohqsg
It's more for those who do not even want to use a card (credit/debit) at all  people who don't trust online/contactless payment systems  then ocbc cater to these.If you're already using debit card  then why not just use a credit card,btohqsg
UOB Krisflyer if you had spent or plan to spend more than $800 on SQ/Scoot this year.$8k will reward you with 24k miles if you meet the TnC.,btohqsg
then ok  UOB debit card for those who cannot qualify for credit card is preferred,btohqsg
"I see  thanks@ChrisHMSG!Also  I saw under the eligible spending  there's the ""Insurance payments made on a recurring basis on selected credit or debit cards""Does anyone know what are the selected cards?",btohqsg

Hi fellow masters  two quick questions:a) when does the citi rewards $1k cap on 10x points Renew itself? On 1st of each calendar month  or depends on when your card is activated?,btohqsg
b) do any of you use citi pay all? What are the costs involved? And still worth to use if for example I've already maxed out the $1k cap on 10k points?,btohqsg
so is it right to conclude for citi premiermiles linked with amaze  1.25cpm*1.2 miles per dollar = about 1.5% cashback  after accounting for fx spread ~2% and amaze nerf  won‚Äôt be really worth it vs youtrip/trust?,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask if the internet for sat and sun for moo moo cash plus will be credit on Monday? I didn‚Äôt receive on weekend but I receive the interest on Monday but it seem like it was only Monday interest. Do the moomoo cash plus earn interest on weekend too?,btohqsg
hi  can I ask for instarem amaze  if I spend in the month of June  when will I receive my instarem amaze points,btohqsg
Hi  just wondering for uob lady's card  the t&c mentioned that it excludes AMAZE*TRANSIT. But your recent video mentioned that uob lady's card is able to use amaze. So wanna confirm whether we are able to use the uob lady's card on amaze.,btohqsg
Correct. Only use 4mpd / 5% cashback and above cards on amaze,btohqsg
2.2% on paid amount  separate cap,btohqsg
immediate. no receive = not qualified,btohqsg
So every weekend interest is only in on Tuesday?,btohqsg
"This question has been asked many times. Short answer is yes. long answer can search ""amaze transit""",btohqsg
What merchant did you spend it on? and how did you pay,btohqsg
I spend it through Google pay (linking Google pay to my amaze card),btohqsg
only Foreign currency merchants earn 0.5% instapoints (1 Aug onwards). watch my latest video today,btohqsg
Ok wait so for local spending I don't earn any instapoints?,btohqsg
What is the best card mile to use for geneco bill payment?,btohqsg
Only the 4 mile per dollar?,btohqsg
Hi  what do you mean by separate cap??? Meaning unlimited 10x points if using citi pay all + citi rewards?,btohqsg
Does it also mean  it won't be worth to use citi pay all + citi cash back as it only gives back 1.6%  whilst you pay 2.2%?,btohqsg
FCY spend only ~ local spending earn nothing on amaze,btohqsg
Yup  people pay to buy miles with citipayall,btohqsg
Thanks  so what cards would be good to pair with citi payall? Since citi rewards only gives 4mpd up to $1k  whilst things like rent / insurance / tax usually cost a lot more?,btohqsg
Can I use Google pay linked to amaze card with CRMC? Or do I need to use the physical amaze card?,btohqsg
can use googlepay also for merchants that allow payment via googlepay,btohqsg
citi payall does not give 4mpd. At most 2.2mpd now under the promo which needs min $8k payall payment by 20 Aug. Best to pair with citi prestige or citi premiermiles where miles dun expire,btohqsg
yup no instapoints but can get 4mpd on crmc for a wide range of mcc (less travel related and the common exclusions) regardless of payment mode.,btohqsg
imo btc and eth yes  but still prepare yourself for mad volatility,btohqsg
Citi rewards will cap at 1k?,btohqsg
Thanks a lot. Sadly just paid up a big chunk of my insurance already so won't hit the 8k :(,btohqsg

May I kindly know after 20 Aug promo  what cards would be best paired with citi payall then? Thank you,btohqsg
Excess cash from UOB one account where can I park the cash in bank for more interest,btohqsg
if uob one account opened middle of the month after salary credited already means no interest for the month?,btohqsg
it takes the daily average balance,btohqsg
OCBC 360?  even though there is not spend or salary credit?,btohqsg
oh then GXS (5k)  UOB Stash (100k)  remaining in MariBank and Trustbank,btohqsg
as in to qualify for the bonus interest*,btohqsg
if your amount is high enough until the daily average balance meets the criteria,btohqsg
mid month still quite easy to meet. just need 200k,btohqsg
for salary credit  is there any oneself pay oneself hack for DBS / OCBC?,btohqsg
Is there a good cashback card to pair with xnap?,btohqsg
uob evol 6.67%  citi cashback 6%,btohqsg
Oh wow citi cashback is 6%?,btohqsg
yes need min $800 monthly spend though,btohqsg
Ah ok. Tough for me.i pair it with uob lady for now,btohqsg
Can't find citi pay all says 4mpd cap at 1k,btohqsg
already clarified there is no 4mpd for citi payall,btohqsg
2.2mpd for 120k max and 8k min  pay 2.2%,btohqsg
Was referring to pairing citi rewards with citi payall,btohqsg
Does that mean citi rewards does not qualify for citi pay all??? Or basically the 4mpd is excluded for citi payall transactions?,btohqsg
citi payall excluded from bonus points for online spend  usually only 1x points or 0.4mpd for citi payall  2.2mpd under the promo which needs min $8k by 20 Aug,btohqsg
So after 20 Aug  it'll revert back to 0.4mpd for any citi miles card?Ie paying 2.2% for 0.4mpd? Sorry for my poor maths  but does that still make citi payall worthwhile?,btohqsg
after 20 Aug  0.4mpd for citi rewards  1.2mpd for citi pm and 1.3mpd for citi prestige. May not be worth it,btohqsg
One of the few ways to pay for insurance  and get something.only good when there's such promo,btohqsg

UOB krisflyer only has a very small whitelist of travel partners and they are all online websites. Since OP said no online payment then this option is no good.,btohqsg
If I have a huge online payment which I go for bank's interest free 12 month installment of say $2K a month to DBSWWMC  do I earn 4mpd on the installment amount of $2K every month or only once based on the total spend of $24K?,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply üôèüèª I now i know tiger rates better. I use interactive broker to exchange USD  i know there is a USD $2 fees. I am curious to know the best way to convert and save up use to buy S&P üòÅ,btohqsg
ibkr is better after a certain amount  can't remember the exact number but a safe threshold is use IBKR to convert if above $10k sgd. else use momoo/tigerthis may be outdated info so  please verify! or hopefully someone who recently ran the numbers could verify,btohqsg
Icic. I think i prefer to change 1-2k usd a month. I asked a few telegram groups and seems that people not bothered by the exchange rates so the difference might not be that huge,btohqsg
Maybe wise but I not sure. I using ibkr method. So u have to test yourself,btohqsg
Haha yes bro. I just return SG at 10pm today. My 2 kidneys still intact üòÇ,btohqsg
hi  the [UOB krisflyer account] is a separate account from the [UOB one account] right? i.e depositing 50k into thhe UOB one account only earns the UOB one interest  and not the UOB krisflyer benefits as well,btohqsg

yes it is known as Cross Border Fee.Happens when the SGD transaction is processed by overseas payment processor. Agoda payment processor is in Hong Kong. Apple Itunes payment processor is in Ireland.,btohqsg
Pair the credit card with Amaze to circumvent the Cross Border Fee  but beware of any implications your credit card rewards could have if paired with Amaze (e.g. DBS excludes Amaze and UOB Krisflyer may not recognise the merchant name if masked by Amaze*),btohqsg
I guess he used 7mpd for Agoda with Citi Premiermiles. Amaze will give 1.2mpd only,btohqsg
yup then no choice have to pay the 1% loh.,btohqsg
I usedagoda.com/en-gb/citisgmastercardto get the 18% off ... I just checked and HSBC is not charging the fee when paying agoda.,btohqsg
"Interestingly the transaction description when paying with citibank card includes""Internet HK""  but when paying with HSBC it says ""Internet SG""",btohqsg
applied for the UOB Lady's card last night at 11pm. this morning login IB and saw the card approved already. thats really fast!,btohqsg
Tried to replicate this against my existing hotel bookings.. does not allow me to deviate from PAY AT HOTEL (which does not qualify for discount)!,btohqsg
"This one is a side by side comparison (left picture is using Citi Agoda ""18% discount"" while right side is just Agoda with a generic discount code (can use any card to pay  I used Amaze+UOB Lady) that I booked one month ago. Same dates same hotel same room type for March 2024.",btohqsg
If I credit my salary to a UOB One account  is it really worth to have other bank accounts with no interest rate benefit just to get different credit cards?,btohqsg
Hi guys  for HSBC credit do it provide a separate estatement for the supplementary card so you know what the person send on. Or is it combine with the principle account estatement?,btohqsg
I guess it will only be printed on statements when you receive it. It won‚Äôt show on the website or apps when you make the booking. Above is my experience with HSBC revo when booking airline ticket on oversea website.,btohqsg
no need bank account to get credit card,btohqsg
So can I combine a let's say an HSBC card or DBS card with a UOB One account?,btohqsg
combine for? if u mean payment  u can pay other bank cc from uob one account via uob app/website or AXS app/website,btohqsg
You can hold any credit card eg.  HSBC card or DBS card without holding their bank account. Use them for your daily expenses.and also hold UOB One account for your saving. If your expenses is more than $500 or $600  use it on UOB Evol  One or Lady card can give you higher interest on your UOB One saving with min $1600 salary crediting.,btohqsg
Interesting  so in that case I won't need to open any HSBC/DBS accounts  right?,btohqsg
No need. If you have saving more than $100k  then may need to strategise so you can get higher interest every month on your saving.It all depends on how much and what are your monthly expenses then can see which credit card is suitable for you.,btohqsg
Any idea how long it takes before I will receive the sms informing me that I am eligible for the 1% cashback on eligible spend and giro bill payments for HSBC EGA?

Few of HSBC account holders share their experience in this chat about this before. Their feedback are mixed. No conclude answer on this. If you use the keyword ‚ÄúHSBC Sms‚Äù to search  you will see their feedback on this. Good luck to you.,btohqsg
I didn't receive any sms  but I did transferred  and received the bonus,btohqsg
Agoda visa payment processor is SG  while master is HK,btohqsg

"Beware for people who withdrew money from moomoo recently. This can disqualify you from getting the promo. This is based on personal experience. I withdrew money at the beginning of Apr and signed up for promo during the middle of Apr and injected funds yet didn't ""qualify""",btohqsg
If you are new user no worries (but I would still worry) since your account had no money anyway,btohqsg
i got the sms after about a week,btohqsg
oo ok thank you. i thought i would only start receiving the cashback after receiving the sms but if that's not the case then thats great,btohqsg

hi if I just started working what is a good credit card to recommend?,btohqsg
UOB One account + UOB lady or UOB One card,btohqsg
go with Citi Rewards Card paired with Instarem Amaze  it gives 4 mpd on almost every category except for travel,btohqsg
with this as the main card  u can start adding side cards to complement your spending style  eg:- you travel alot? add UOB Lady's card for 6mpd for travel category- you take public transport? add Standard Chartered smart card for 6% cashback- you spend more than $1k on online spend? add DBS Woman's World Card for 4 mpd for onlin spend,btohqsg
Hi  if I‚Äôm need to clock uob one interest? I will use uob one / evol / lady?,btohqsg
UOB EVOL is better  cos u can hit $600 spend on every categoryUOB One also $600  but need to hit for 3 consecutive monthsUOB Lady is only on 1 category  might be harder to hit,btohqsg
For OCBC card spending  I log in to OCBC IB  and my credit limit x800  combined credit left x687.33  what you have spent = 112.67.

I want to make sure I spend enough for OCBC 360 for extra bonus interest  Does anyone notice this? I spend only on Shopee  Lazada  Giant  Cab  XNAP  Seafood restaurant  Mr. Coconut this month,btohqsg

Please contact the bank for clarification as we do not have access to information regarding the reasons for your ineligibility.,btohqsg
For this  can we add up both UOB one and UOB lady card spending to clock for the $500 spend for higher interest for UOB one account? Or must clock on only 1 card?,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt provide link so I provide screenshot instead.Syfe anniversary promo.Fee waiver only for fresh funds. Existing funds won‚Äôt enjoy fee waiver.Verified with Syfe le.,btohqsg
this is the general consensus I have gathered so far,btohqsg
I don't know much about this  but will look into it or if anyone has more info regarding this please share thanks!,btohqsg
so uob one account as the main card isit?,btohqsg
so citi rewards + amaze or uob one which one should I pick? what should be the deciding factor?,btohqsg
can add both. but if using uob one card and not clocking min $500 in statement month u not getting any rebate,btohqsg
One thing Chris mentioned in his video is first you must able to track and measure your spending. Second is to choose whether you want cashback or miles. There's different strategy for both cashback and miles.,btohqsg
Any guru here know whether I can use Citi rewards card for PropertyGuru account subscription? Paying by installment monthly  does it clock the 4mpd with Citi rewards?,btohqsg
I think i need to work on the first part  thanks for the advice!,btohqsg
UOB One account will give you 3.85% interest if you spend $500 a month and credit your salary into the account. You can get the account first and spend on the debit card to get the bonus interest before you decide which credit card is more suitable for you,btohqsg
Mile card only suitable for high spender and those who like to travel in biz class btw. If u just in workforce probably cashback,btohqsg
Yes  UOB has one of the best savings accounts. No harm getting a UOB DEBIT card first. Earn some interest as you track your spending.,btohqsg
Actually how high would you consider enough? I dont mind save up 2-3 years miles for a business flight. And travel is more fun if you have friends or spouse to travel with.,btohqsg
Hi guys just an update about the IG inactive fees. They say the total fees is $1100 and they agreed to refund only 50% $550 as goodwill.I dont know if i should write letter to MAS or to small claims tribunal anot.

I will just don't waste the time and move on. Unless you really angry and want to fight back just for justice.,btohqsg
No lah. I not angry but i was hoping to get more back üò≠,btohqsg
Then don't waste time. The time wasted cost more than the $550.,btohqsg
actually i think it is a rather fair settlement..both side give in a bit liao loh,btohqsg
I guess it will be difficult. They wrote in the agreement clearly  but you forgot. You can estimate how much time to fight against IG and what is your time cost.,btohqsg
Actually their terms and conditions doesn‚Äôt doesnt indicate the fees. They put a website link and they never show or tell u the website. They didnt even mentioned about the fees.,btohqsg
Life will never be perfect. I also lost monies unnecessarily before. What we can do is just move on.,btohqsg

U need to make sure the mcc is 5812 or 5814,btohqsg

Example if i use dbs lady card i only can choose one category‚Ä¶ amaze can help me get 5mpd no matter what category?,btohqsg
Hihi Gurus! Can advice how to check MCC code under digitbot?,btohqsg
Can I use SP Bills or Travel to hit Maybank's $800 minimum spend (even if I don't get cashback on those)?,btohqsg
Can check if xnap paired with amaze+crc earn you 10x points?,btohqsg
converts offline transactions to online transactions for local spend,btohqsg
It doesn't change the underlying MCC code so ur Lady's card will still be only for the category u have chosen to gain the bonus points.Amaze is good for overseas spending to have better xchange rates  otherwise locally  so far only citibank rewards card see e benefit of changing offline to online as online spending will get bonus points for citi rewards card,btohqsg
Ooo I just rmbed.. for UOB If tagged with Amaze for local spending at UNI$ merchants  it helps to reward u on bonus points from the card instead of giving u UNI$  which is a better route than receiving UNI$ for spending at UNI merchants,btohqsg
"google mcc for ""grocery stores  supermarket""",btohqsg

Is uob evol a good first credit card for me as a young adult that just started working fulltime for about a year?,btohqsg
yes if your monthly spending fits online spend $250+mobile contactless $250+ $100 any payment mode,btohqsg
Can one category be more than the other? Like $100 online and $500 mobile contactless? Or must i hit both categories the min $250‚Äôeach,btohqsg
Each category caps out at $250 ($20),btohqsg
8% online capped at $20 i.e. $250 spend8% mobile contactless capped at $20 i.e. $250 spendtotal min $600 in statement monthyou can spend more in one category but get less rebate. Anyway nowadays some offline spend can become online spend e.g. shopback pay  favepay  fairprice app  xnap etc,btohqsg
Total must be at least 600. But rebate is based on each category.,btohqsg
Ahh understand  thanks guys ü§ôüèº appreciate it,btohqsg
Does ordering food on grab considered as online spending?,btohqsg
You use credit card in grab to pay  don‚Äôt use grab wallet to pay. Then count as credit card spending.,btohqsg
to add on. Can consider say foodpanda instead  grabfood tend to be more expensive,btohqsg
Do subscriptions count as online spending? Like netflix  spotify  icloud storage etc. And does personal insurance and motorbike instalment falls under others category?,btohqsg
Installation don‚Äôt count. You may count insurance in other category  but nobody cares about 0.3% rebate.,btohqsg

Is crmc + amaze still good? I saw the latest video  it says amaze fx spread is 2%  while crmc cashback is also about 2%. Now that they nerf the instapoints the net gain is less than 1%?,btohqsg

can refer to chris new video  he got explain the new amaze nerf,btohqsg
The calculations he used is based on mpd  which means if i use the citipoints for cashback (2%)  net gain is less than 1%?,btohqsg

My card and the letter of code came together  or one day apart cause I didn‚Äôt check my mailbox daily.Maybe someone else wrongly took your card or mailman wrongly sent to other address‚Ä¶Usually the letter of code comes after your card delivery.. so I guess you need to call UOB to resend your card‚Ä¶,btohqsg

just toggle to ladies card when you are gg to pay for your diningand toggle back after the payment is logged on your app (usually immediate),btohqsg
Are you getting 4mpd for the recurring giga bill?,btohqsg
Hey guys just wanted to check I just received HSBC revolution cc. I have did paywave for $400 worth of transactions and they only gave me 400 points which is 1x reward. Any idea if I‚Äôm doing something wrong here that I‚Äôm not getting the 10x reward?,btohqsg
Isn't gxs up to 75k now for 3.48%?,btohqsg
based on earlier convo above crmc+amaze is 4mpd. i used crmc alone and didn‚Äôt get 4mpd,btohqsg
i used crmc for fairprice app when paying at the counter and got 10x so i‚Äôm sure online would get u 10x,btohqsg
think i might forget since dining is part of everyday  and if i have to toggle to meet the recurring payment schedule of a few bills might not be worth the effort :/,btohqsg

hello  any non-pr/non-SG citizen recently applied for UOB CCs? have you gotten your approval from UOB? Applied two weeks ago and no new until now üò≠,btohqsg
I‚Äôm existing UOB CC  Singapore citizen my waiting time was 2-3weeks. They are extremely slow üò¢,btohqsg
Same  the app just hang there,btohqsg
damn then I guess it'll be a month for me ahhahaha,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sp holder  and I applied 3 weeks ago still no response,btohqsg
I think due to lately high volume for TS concert. The waiting time might even double,btohqsg
Yst I tried calling UOB CS  literally they don‚Äôt let me wait on the call. They just hang and expect me to write in or call other timing,btohqsg
damn I guess only can wait,btohqsg
Yeap same case as well called yesterday,btohqsg
Moneysmart email say point system rather than cashback. Not sure is it for the better or worse.,btohqsg

I max out GXS liao! for those that deposit into GXS do remember to put into the savings pocket else you won't get the 3.48 P.A interest.,btohqsg
So when daily interests get added on and exceed 75k  we don‚Äôt have to transfer out right. It will get compounded to the original 75k principle and continue to earn 3.48% right,btohqsg
I applied at 11pm and got SMS approval the very next morning at 8.40am. By noon can see my new card on internet banking already. UOB can be very fast,btohqsg
no need transfer out but those amount above 75k don't earn interest I think. but I not sure also.,btohqsg
Gxs move become game changer for savings strategy,btohqsg
Actually isn‚Äôt the interest rate already similar to UOB one/ OCBC 360? Pardon the silly question,btohqsg
I think ocbc360 is only 3.25% for salary credit + $500 saving,btohqsg
But Uob one Is 3.85% for salary credit + saving + spending I think,btohqsg
uob and ocbc much better. I max out UOB and OCBC first.,btohqsg
Looks like >75k still continue to earn. Thanks for sharing  YX!,btohqsg
But if lets say im not spending with their bank's card then might gxs be better in this case?,btohqsg
Yup! I think that‚Äôs correct hahaha,btohqsg
For OCBC which is higher for Uob for no spending criteria  (but with salary and savings) is around 3.2%,btohqsg
Just to point out your statement. Uob only salary crediting and 500$ cc spend. No need savings.,btohqsg
then maybe you can check the bank website to compute the interest without spendings,btohqsg
Oh is it hahaha thanks for letting me know. Haha I‚Äôve newly joined the workforce and just signed up for UOB one  but am not too sure if im able to hit 500/ month on debit/ credit spending hahaha,btohqsg
Wonder how long GXS is able to offer such competitive interest rates hahaha,btohqsg
If u cannot meet the 500$ spend. Go with SIF or GXS,btohqsg
Can only say  milk while it lasts  starting today üòÑ by the time this is discussed over the next few days/weeks  you are earning the daily interests already..,btohqsg
since im using smartCC for bus/fastfood/coffee  my monthly expense have been thinner out by at least 100-200... hence my other spending will less likely to hit $500 per month which i am using hsbc revo card for the 2.5% cashback,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt OCBC better 360 better at 3.2%:-),btohqsg
Really liking GXS branding too and their soon integration with dash,btohqsg
Yes. If salary credit + save OR cc spend. Then ocbc is better. If u want fuzz free. SIF or GXS.,btohqsg

No lah I mean buy the $1 giga promo code for him. He never scam. But just really cheapskate and freeloader want for free,btohqsg
Enjoy while lasted LoR high interest,btohqsg
I heard cimb takes a long while to open account.,btohqsg
GXS with daily compounding technically is 3.55%,btohqsg
Correct me if im wrong  i did a rough calculation and at 50k for 3yrs Daily compounding got me 55'442Monthly compounding got me 55'414Difference isnt as much as i thought  maybe can enlighten if my math fail..,btohqsg
ya i think its abt there....,btohqsg
Nvm  relied on online calculator .. 3.5% monthly compounding is still better than gxs,btohqsg
Somehow both values also wrong...Principal of 50k  after 3 years:Daily compounding: $55 501.94Monthly compounding: $55 493.83,btohqsg
Yup. 0.02% makes a difference. But the question is  combining with other benefits  is it worth your time and effort compared to GXS no-effort 3.48% pa.,btohqsg
Yeap agree  literally 5mins sign up for GXS and top up and I can shove it aside alrdy haha,btohqsg
Yup. That's why I'm rethinking opening UOB one also haha,btohqsg
hello  wanted to ask whether i can earn 4mpds when using dbswmc for sistic (buy tickets)?,btohqsg
Everyone values their time differently. Imo spending 5-10 mins to set up UOB One Account is worth it for me for the increased interest,btohqsg
Sign up pretty fast also for cimb via Singpass.  Anyway  0.02% diff only. Take any also ok. The key is who going to downgrade first ü§£.,btohqsg
When online of coz  not at sistic counter,btohqsg
hi experts  any idea if already own citi rewards is it required to resubmit 3 mths payslip if applying another citi card ?,btohqsg
no need resubmit documents but citi will pull your credit bureau again,btohqsg
Stupid leh. The person who bought the line is responsible for all charges incurred. Unless you trust the person a whole lot  stupid to be altruistic in this way.,btohqsg
I bought 2 extra lines  but they are for my mom and dad  and I am switching out the moment it reaches the end of 4 months free.,btohqsg
the 1$ giga line can choose number ?,btohqsg
Think can . I can't get it   no one want to help (send me invite code ),btohqsg
hi all can I confirm if contactless spending (apple pay  google pay  in-app purchases) qualify for the bonus points for WWMC? I don‚Äôt see contactless spending in the exclusion list,btohqsg
why don't you pay whoever that can help the $1 needed for them to invite?,btohqsg
invitation is not free for your info.,btohqsg
Yes. Of course I will pay   but they don't send me how can I pay back,btohqsg
you send them first lorr. $1 is a risk you can manage I supposed.,btohqsg
Not stupid. Just never tot $1 also got ppl so cheapskate. üòÇ,btohqsg
No no no no  you are wrong. You don't know how smart scammers are nowadays. $1 can become a few thousand,btohqsg
Why you should NOT Pay off your Home Loan Earlyhttps://youtu.be/o6ysdb_LGeU,btohqsg
you look for those that chat here regularly lorr,btohqsg
Nice. Say I scammer. Lol. Real BS,btohqsg
contactless is not online  only at best 1x point (0.4mpd). in-app payment on website/app is online  gets 4mpd so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
I urge you to stop asking for this since no one here could fulfill even asking multiple times. Next course of action will be muted,btohqsg
just take a risk with the $1. if got scammed report to admin and help the group get rid of one scammer. The $1 will be well spent.,btohqsg
"Don't do it  it is not worth doing someone this favour. You will be responsible for all activities related to that new line that you gave to your ""friend"". For me different  I am doing it for my family members.",btohqsg
Hi guys. How do I check my HSBC Revo credit card limit from the app?It just got approved and I‚Äôve set up the app but can‚Äôt find out anywhere!  Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
there a black line.... after you click into your card.. you need to pull down or up.. you will see more info,btohqsg
Yup. Which is why I'm still leaning towards opening it. Along with the UOB ONE card. It's not that difficult  just that already have an existing GXS account.,btohqsg
Hi guys does Atome affect ur credit score,btohqsg
Taking installment credit won‚Äôt directly impact your credit rating. You can even improve your credit rating by paying the amount in monthly payments on time. However  if for some reason or the other you fall back on your payments or miss any installments  then retailers often retain the right to do a hard check  in which case  your credit score might get impacted negatively.https://www.atome.sg/blog/understand-installment-credit-and-how-to-use-it,btohqsg
Postpaid for Grab PayLater doesnt though right üôà,btohqsg
As long as you pay on time  no impact,btohqsg

Hi experts I bought an air ticket thrutrip.comusing dbs altitude card for $1584.25 but only received 1584 dbs points  shouldn't I be getting 3mpd instead of 2mpd? I can't get my math right,btohqsg
Hmm.....I disagree with you. Just because I get a few negative messages from unkind people (for example  user@jj000111  who told a false one-sided story that I don‚Äôt even want to entertain him) does not mean that others do also. Maybe others just haven‚Äôt seen my message yet. üòÖI don't see anything wrong with asking multiple times. I‚Äôm also not posting referral links to earn rewards for myself  which would compromise your earnings. I also remember what successful people say  don‚Äôt give up easily; you will succeed one day(someone will eventually help you). I hope you can understand.,btohqsg
When in Rome  do as the Romans do.,btohqsg
