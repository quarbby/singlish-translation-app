The tips 8$ get from who ?,btohqsg
Lala will credit into your wallet or collect from vendor ?,btohqsg
Does anyone know more about the tips ?,btohqsg
Collect cash or lala will paid ?,btohqsg
"After complete loadDo not press ""confirm bill""Until customer credit the tips to u",btohqsg
So u may need to remind customer to do so,btohqsg
Is not credited by lala right ?,btohqsg
But sometime is vendor put the tips. Not the customer. When we send there who will pay for the tips,btohqsg
Or we must collect before we even go to the destination,btohqsg
I mean customer as in vendor,btohqsg
Depends  they may say paynow you later,btohqsg
I mean sometime shop put tips not customer. So we send there already customer don even know got this tips thing,btohqsg
If the shop not automatic u need call them lo,btohqsg

2 days ago I sent one order from Scotts to Mt E can even walk 10 mins to reach I got $20.,btohqsg
Customer thought go Mt E hospital is secure zone so she add In secure zone $15 😅,btohqsg
Why your lalamove layout different? Blue colour?,btohqsg
No leh. They didn’t pay secured zone. Base price $10 + LLM Platform rewards $10. What is this platform rewards? Why some orders have $10  some have $5 and some don’t have.,btohqsg
Platform Rewards = Subsidy = extra bonus,btohqsg
