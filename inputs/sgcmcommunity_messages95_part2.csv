Why ah? what's wrong with 3A? - J,btohqsg
Honestly auto is the way to go anyways for comfort,btohqsg
Thats true  most if not all manual license holders are also driving automatics for comfort. Weird flex imo hahaha,btohqsg
SG context  it's wise to drive auto cars...unless you're planning to train your legs (being in half-clutch for those  heavy traffic routes).,btohqsg
Car Review: Facelift - Volvo XC40 Recharge Plus Electric Plus 69 kWh (A) 📝With Volvo's mission to be a fully-electric car company by year 2030  the XC40 Recharge (along with the Volvo C40 Recharge) takes a very crucial step towards this in a familiar and unfrightening manner.Volvo may have downsized the battery of the all-electric XC40 Recharge  but the crossover remains to be a delight to pilot on our roads.👉🏻 React with 😍 if you think Volvo did a good job with the XC40's facelift!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg

Good job  happy you didn't use donor car  waste time and money doing that and pump straight into your car,btohqsg
Tldr. Auto is for people who like to pleasure themselves with toys. Practical and gets the job done.Manual keeps you in touch with your partner in perfect harmony.,btohqsg
Hard to beat an osgasmic  downshift that comes with an aggressive DCT though,btohqsg
Clearly you dont know the joy of nailing a double downshift.,btohqsg
Not save engine  it's the gearbox,btohqsg

What they don't tell you: A loud exhaust doesn't always make more power 😆Contrary to what you might believe  a louder exhaust isn't always better for performance and it certainly doesn't make it a superior option - the only definite thing is the car is now noisier!👉🏻 React with 🔥 if you love the roar of a good performance exhaust!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg
It's not about the power.. its about the sound HAHHAHA,btohqsg
Gently reminding pedestrians that there is a car approaching so they should stop staring at their phones and look up to where they are walking,btohqsg
for bikes is actually useful tho,btohqsg
agreed. With some of the hybrids and EV no sound being emitted.. really a danger considering all the noise cancelling headphones nowadays..,btohqsg
got one guy think that straight pipe civic is fast,btohqsg
Some sort of whir or bzzz is piped out through speakers by law,btohqsg
i sat some EVs before  it was damn quiet,btohqsg
Obviously won't be as loud as a v8 bah,btohqsg
or some i see driving along the street  sound was very minimal,btohqsg
Almost got by one cause I couldn’t hear it coming LOL,btohqsg
yah  the sound too minimal alr  especially since nowadays ppl plug in headphones and walk -.- gna kena rob also dk alr,btohqsg
the only sound i actually hear from EV is actually their reversing sound..,btohqsg
You plug in headphones sure cannot hear regular Toyota  kia  Hyundai also,btohqsg
A stock car quite quiet also,btohqsg
is soundproofing a car a good investment?hate the rain sound and road sound.....,btohqsg
But how are you gonna hear your engine roar!!,btohqsg
Then if you don’t wanna hear the road then sure,btohqsg
Road noise must invest in better tyres first,btohqsg
Can do dampening for more soundproofing,btohqsg
Can do wheel wells and doors for road noise,btohqsg
It does add weight to your doors and the car,btohqsg
But not too too much if you're a regular car,btohqsg
im using some toyotires and the road noise is slighter better now.but during rainy days still can hear all the water sounds very clearly thru roof and wheels...,btohqsg
any good place to recommend for sound proofing?,btohqsg
not sure want to do it in SG or Msia...been considering for quite long,btohqsg
rather than do sound proofing  upgrade your sound system,btohqsg
drown out the noise with music can liao,btohqsg
i think this option gonna be more expensive than soundproofing.,btohqsg
or do you have any price friendly sound system to recommend?,btohqsg
The thing with sound systems is that they too require dampening sheets to be used so that you don't hear rattling plastics,btohqsg
