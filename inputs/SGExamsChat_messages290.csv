idk if this helps but what pushed me was that i didn't want to regret whatever result i would get  so i kinda just stopped spending time worrying and spent more time studying after fixating on the idea of trying my best and making sure i leave the exam hall without regrets (which is not the same as the idea of getting X score),btohqsg
