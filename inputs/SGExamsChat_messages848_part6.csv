Anyways good luck for those collecting their o lvl results tmr!Remember that whatever result you get  take it in your stride  plan your next course of action; going to jc? Poly? Ite?

Still rmb how CJC used to be a mid tier jc,btohqsg
"some fella offering ghost writing services for assignments & ""tuition"" for fkin over $20 per consultation",btohqsg
Ghost writing for $20 is crazy,btohqsg
can't ghost write your way to uni,btohqsg
Bro better help me write a whole book that I could sell to kids as storybook,btohqsg
Oh. Most of us use chatgpt nowadays,btohqsg
Chatgpt 4.3 is the new trend,btohqsg
you can't ghost write in uni i think,btohqsg
as a mathematician i am impressed (sarcastic),btohqsg
It failed to do a Stanford 2025 problem,btohqsg
They are a good starting point,btohqsg
You have to specific to what you input,btohqsg
how do you change the sizes of key inputs?,btohqsg
We do not use * in actual mathematics,btohqsg
Unless you talk about stuff like Kleene closures etc. in theoretical computer science,btohqsg
idk chatgpt said that there are diff sizes,btohqsg
That's the only occurrence of * in typeset contexts,btohqsg
I think ChatGPT means that * is used when you can't type in Ã—,btohqsg
Idk why they give you liddat,btohqsg
a * b need not denote multiplication,btohqsg
how are there so many diff asterisk,btohqsg
* is very common as some operation in group theory,btohqsg
I guess chatgpt is quite subjective,btohqsg
It alters depending on different people accounts I suppose,btohqsg
i asked that  this was my first result,btohqsg
chatgpt is still useful if you can break it down into specific concepts,btohqsg
it's obviously not going to solve a question from start to end,btohqsg
the most useful for me using chatgpt is coding a whole website from scratch,btohqsg
every single component 1 prompt at a time,btohqsg
also if he's legit a phd student  he's kinda stupid for putting it here when he's offering things like that,btohqsg
that same dude mentioned he was from ite/poly not too long as well so,btohqsg
Why wld u put that in ur bio,btohqsg
Bro thinks this is linkedin or sth,btohqsg
It's the day of O level results guysss,btohqsg
Lol guy tried too desperately to offer his academic services to me,btohqsg
Shot him down at every opportunity,btohqsg
My answer to him: there's nothing google and chatgpt can't do for me,btohqsg
have.making sure you know all the different ways and methods that examiners can test you in examsPure conceptual knowledge  while useful  doesn't mean can help you answer exam questions in the best possible way.,btohqsg
eg O level kinematics  I have 12 different ways in which calculation questions could test students. I also have a few compilation of the most common explanation questions.This one chatgpt can't do. Probably can hit a few  but who would be satisfied with just a few if the aim is to ace the exams?,btohqsg
then again  that guy is probably a scammer that would use chatgpt to do the job anyway.,btohqsg
You can just try not to be caught ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Good Luck And All The Best For The O Level Results Release Later!,btohqsg
The amount of Plagarism checkers and AI generated bot detectors,btohqsg
Good luck for O Level Results. Just remember O Level is just a checkpoint. You can always revisit and retake.  Itâ€™s not an end all judgement day.,btohqsg
anyone else been getting shit tons of scam callers lately,btohqsg
