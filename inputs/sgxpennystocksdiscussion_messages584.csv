🍟Pika World Lunch Date🍕⛳Alibaba: Show me the Light📱It might seem intriguing for many that the wonders of the return of Alibaba appear to fall short of a spectacular run-up. Nevertheless  the wild ride of the stock price is likely to stay.The momentum seems to have slowed down as BABA fell by about 1% on Wednesday. Despite climbing out of the hole on Monday and Tuesday by rising 12%  a look at the overall chart reveals its lowest levels since 2017.Indeed  the vibrant mood during the early week is boosted by the management shakeup with a new CFO at the helm soon. Further changes include segregating the e-commerce unit into domestic and international markets. The structural change breathes fresh air into the stock  but it is not possible to alter the macro landscape of the company.Most importantly  the company sees slower growth as sales missed targets and exhibit poorer earnings expectations with a cut in its full-year outlook. It is clear how profits were eaten by weakening margins in a competitive e-commerce landscape.📉Chinese stocks under Pressure💊As Alibaba faced regulatory scrutiny both in China and US  the wave of crackdowns continued to weigh on investors appetite for Chinese stocks  as President Xi is determined to tighten his hold on the economic trajectory of China.Concerns on the future of US-listed Chinese companies is an overhang on many Chinese counters  especially with Didi announcement to delist in the US and move to Hong Kong for a listing  as discussed in our prior updates.🛎Weibo: Disappointing Start💈Likewise  we had seen a less spectacular start for Chinese social media giant Weibo  which tumbled in Hong Kong yesterday by about 7%  adding poor sentiments on Chinese tech counters. The company has a primary listing in Nasdaq under the ticker  WB  which was also down for the day.The underwhelming performance for its trading debut in Hong Kong spells risk-off sentiments on US-listed Chinese assets. Portfolio managers appear to be exploring investing in their HK counterparts stock.📡Out Revised Outlook🪜Pika World maintains exposure to the e-commerce giant  BABA  as there are reasons to be optiamistic. It is still a dominant Chinese e-commerce business. It has made a concerted effort to invest in new companies  including cloud computing business and  of course  a potential gain in the food delivery and offline retail business.We hope you enjoy this read. Have a splendid lunch breakCheers Pika Nat,btohqsg

Evergrande Declared in Default as Massive Restructuring Looms1. China Evergrande Group has officially been labeled a defaulter for the first time  the latest milestone in months-long financial drama that paves the way for a massive restructuring of the world’s most indebted developer.2. Fitch Ratings cut the developer to restricted default over its failure to meet two coupon payments after a grace period expired on Monday  according to a statement. The credit assessor said the developer didn’t respond to request for confirmation on the payment  and is assuming it wasn’t made. The downgrade may trigger cross defaults on Evergrande’s $19.2 billion of dollar debt.3. The development marks the beginning of the end for the sprawling real estate empire started 25 years ago by founder Hui Ka Yan  setting off a lengthy battle over who gets paid from what remains. It also poses a challenge to the Chinese government’s efforts to prevent a debt crisis in the property sector from sparking broader contagion. Authorities have scored some successes  with markets taking the most recent developer debt stumbles in their stride after a reserve-ratio cut announced by the central bank on Monday.More here,btohqsg

Hopefully I am right tonight 🙏🙏,btohqsg
💡Pika World In-Focus🔦In the world of electric vehicles  the chase on autonomous driving technology and battery technology are two key elements to become a global leader. In this episode  let’s talk about a new baby battery company in the market.🎙Decarbonisation Plus Acquisition Corp III (DCRC)🛡The company is a direct competitor to QuantumScape. The newly formed solid-state electric vehicle battery technology company is expected to gain hype as the merger of a SPAC format is approved  which will value the company at more than $500 million in fresh capital.The symbol is expected to change to SLDP in tonight trading hours. It is yet another counter for exposure to the EV battery technology company for new investors. Solid Power is backed by Ford and BMW.👍What’s so great about solid-state battery🚘In a typical lithium-ion battery  the facilitator is in liquid form. In the solid-state format  it aims to create such a battery without having any liquid electrolyte. In China  CATL is also investing in solid-state batteries.The benefits are enormous. Such batteries aim to lower costs and allow quicker charging capabilities with a safer and longer battery life. But  unfortunately  the market has not seen any company creating a large scale automotive nature solid-state battery. Moreover  it is challenging to develop since such battery packs tend to work under very high pressure to avoid defects from creating that could worsen battery performance. Hence  they are more difficult to develop compared to the lithium-ion version.🛹Should you be Investing?💵The company is far from the revenue-generating phase. However  it does have a lofty projection of about $1 billion in sales by 2027. Investors will therefore need to gauge the milestone and development to ensure viability for early investing mode. After all  the company is just in the pioneer stage of doing a sample to validate its technology in 2022. When such samples are proven acceptable  investors can explore how the production could scale up and increase the wider testing adoption by EV companies.As the road is less travelled  the potential rewards are juicy for early startups. For example  solid Power stock (after the SPAC merger) is valued at around $2.2 billion compared to QuantumScape  which is currently valued at around $11 billion.It is a stock that Pika World will be exploring!If you find this edition useful  do share with your friends as it helps us reach out to a wider audience. Have a great evening ahead!Pika Nat,btohqsg

🚀Pika World on Demand🚀⌛️Omicron and the UK restriction🥊Equity markets took a beating  with most stocks lower. The UK had imposed more significant Covid restrictions  and the expected tighter monetary condition in Europe weighed on sentiments. Essentially  the UK is imposing another work  from home order and the mask guidelines as Omicron starts to sweep across the country again.Cyclical stocks tend to be hurt the most as the uncertainty of how the Omicron variant will develop with the new restriction adds pressure to a recent recovery after a sharp drawn down last week. It is a break from a risk-on sentiment.💼European Central Bank: I am cutting!🧯Indeed  tech stocks had a tough day after a report hints that ECB is looking to reduce its monthly bond purchase  which is likely to follow the Fed’s action. Naturally  this negatively impacts tech companies for their rich valuation  given that their long stream of expected future profits is likely to reduce in present value.🕹Technology stocks valuation remains elevated🧨As a quick guide  the tech stocks do have room to move lower because the multiple of next year earnings per share is around 32 times. This was more than the 25 times multiple before the pandemic in a situation when bond yields were higher than now and that the Fed wasn’t rolling in cash into the market in that period.Likewise  a better jobless claims reading gives the Fed more reason to proceed to tamper as the employment outlook seems to stabilise.Today  the US inflation data will be most looked into  possibly pushing the Fed to pursue a more aggressive tapering process.It has been a challenging past week  and Pika World wishes all friends a safe trading day ahead!,btohqsg

💡Ask Pika Series #8🔦There appear to be a plethora of questions on what happens when your Chinese counters get delisted. While it is anyone's guess  below are three possible paths that Pika World believes could be the scenario.💰#1: Shares BuybackThe Chinese company would buy back its shares from investors based on an agreed price with the shareholders. This is a path towards privatization. But  of course  if the company aims to go public  it can do so with a separate listing  such as in Hong Kong.📲#2: Share TransferInvestors would exchange their Chinese ADR shares for the company's foreign stocks. Unfortunately  since Didi does not have any secondary listing  it will need to possibly begin a listing in perhaps Hong Kong or Shanghai to begin the transfer mechanism for its ADRs.🧨#3: Trap Big TimeIf Didi does not buy back its shares and does not begin a new listing  then the ability to trade its shares are in jeopardy. Essentially  investors will own the company's equity but are unable to do normal trading in a regulated exchange. There is the likelihood of trading in the over-the-counter markets (like Luckin Coffee which Pika Nat holds) for some. The downside is OTC counters have limited liquidity  and you might be in a trap to hold till a new listing is commenced.We hope you enjoy this read. Have a wonderful lunch!Cheers Pika Nat,btohqsg

"211210#MarketAnalysisFor market to ""rest"" on Wednesday and Thursday is normal due to the strong move upside on Monday and Tuesday. IF S&P D1 closes below half of Thesday's body or worse  closes below Tuesday body  then bears are going to attack. But I don't think it will happen towards the bearish as Wednesday and Thursday's volume is a lot lower than Monday and Tuesday. Therefore I think  we should be going higher which means you have to pay attention to world indices. But having said that  tonight 9:30pm (GMT+8) will have CPI news and it would not be a surprise if the inflation is a lot higher than expected which may trigger a more aggressive tapering in next week FOMC meeting. But I would be looking to see after the CPI news is out and if market goes lower  I will be watching for intraday bullish candles to see if market can go higher. If it can go higher  this may mean we should be going to all time high in S&P next week.",btohqsg

🛏Pika World Bedtime Story🧸Reach for the stars is perhaps the last time investors hope for in the upcoming November inflation report. It is a tense moment. After all  Wall Street and Washington are worried about Nov’s figure pointing to the fastest annual rate for many decades.r🎙The ExpectationEconomists are generally looking for a 0.7% month over month increase in Consumer Price Index. As a result  the yearly rate increase is expected to be 6.7%  marking the fastest growth ever since the 1980s.💣Uncle Powell hands are TiedIf the figures come close to the expected level  then we are likely to see the Fed increase in the pace of scaling down the bond purchase.Hitting above expectation could send the market into turmoil as we are likely to see a faster rate increase  with some expecting in March. Although we had a more hawkish Uncle Powell recently  it provides investors with the time to adjust to the expectation of a tighter monetary situation.🗽President Biden Social SpendingHigher CPI reading is likely to complicate Biden’s trillion-dollar social spending plan. Sen Machin had been less inclined to vote for the bill partly due to the worry of inflation. Nonetheless  Senate Majority Leader Schumer had stated his desire to have the legislation complete before Christmas. So from now till then  the November inflation data is the only report of great significance.Economists generally do not expect the social spending plan to impact the inflation figure profoundly. This considers the more extended period of spending and the type of investment from the bill. Nonetheless  Machin is not willing to vote for a bill that continues to dash markets with streams of cash.🪜Challenges AheadEquity markets certainly prefer a milder figure. Despite some recovery of issues relating to supply chain constraints  Delta variant continues to complicate return to work momentum  more so with the uprising of Omicron  which could add fuel to inflation when consumers demand keeps coming at an elevated level.This volatile period poses challenging period to our portfolio returns and we remain conservative with tiny accumulation in each episode of pull back.Cheers Pika Nat,btohqsg
What a great week! Many more ahead!,btohqsg

Only quite recently  UnUsual Entertainment attempted the Crypto catalyst card. Brunei Prince Qawi (current Chairman) of HS Optimus/former KLW holdings coincidently is also an investor in UnUsual.Let’s see if they come out with some Crypto related news for HSO  if so hodlers all laugh to the bank 🏦.Looking at the recent FY21 Annual report of HS Optimus   it states ‘Exploring New Possibilities’ and depicts a pic of a door 🚪 opening to a ‘blockchain’ image.Signs? Time will tell. $0.004 risk free anyways.DYODD,btohqsg

📮Pika World in Focus🛎🍎Apple: Prospering in Uncertainty🍐Shares of Apple have been on the ride up as it has achieved more than 30% return year to date. In addition  it is marching towards a valuation of $3 trillion  unimaginable a year ago. Microsoft is the only company with a market cap over $2 trillion  with Alphabet  Amazon and Tesla each having a valuation above $1 trillion.✈️Safe Haven for Investors🪂It appears to be a flight to safety preferred stock by market participants. The pandemic had proven to have negligible impacts on its business model as consumers rushed to buy its Macs and iPads.As we move towards more normalcy in our life  we see the Apple services segment continuing to grow aggressively. Apple services business produces about $70 billion a year in revenue. Moreover  the innovation of Apple is rewarded by a deep sense of customer loyalty given its friendly shareholder policy of an aggressive shares buyback policy. So  logically  investors are inclined to love Apple.📱iPhone 13 Demand remains firm💰While there has been concern about its demand  most analysts report a robust iPhone 13 sales projection that exceeds supply. Part shortages are likely to eat into the December quarter result as the company faces pressure to meet demand. Yet  this has not impeded the rising share price momentum.🗽An Exciting Future⛳Wall Street is baking in more company growth with a possible two new categories of products: AR &VR headsets and autonomous vehicles. But  so far  it seems that potential upsides primarily drive price targets upward momentum based on iPhone sales and App Store activity rather than on the rumours of these latest products development.The future of Apple looks exciting. Any potential pullback will entice Pika World to accumulate more exposure to the company that continues to innovate incrementally and become a more wholesome component of our everyday lives.Thanks for reading this edition.
