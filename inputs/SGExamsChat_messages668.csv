Is it because you did well,btohqsg
i was frm catholic school. got hymm and prayers,btohqsg
my entire platoon highest education all O level then me  psle,btohqsg
but then duribg prayers they ask those not Catholics to pray in their own religion,btohqsg
at least they dont force them,btohqsg
then you see the slides of how many people get 90 and wonder if you are one of them,btohqsg
my batch ye  not sure about others but likely have,btohqsg
it was toxic because they show the 90 names first before they give out the certs LOL,btohqsg
then all the 90 hopefuls find out on the spot that they didn't get it,btohqsg
you can ask your grand senior who is also the 100rp legend,btohqsg
Ayo I smell fellow junior ?,btohqsg
With pride and joy let us sing~,btohqsg
Yes it's disgusting but do uk alumni who went to tjc rewear their skirts,btohqsg

It’s not like they can reprint on the spot,btohqsg
Yeah nth will change no matter how u worry,btohqsg
Even so they still do it all the time,btohqsg
it actually doesn’t matter like at all,btohqsg
profs do not care about this,btohqsg
does prof care if i ask during the application window,btohqsg
like at most profs will tell you they can’t be a good one and reject or they still try to help with disclaimer that there may not be much to say,btohqsg
like is it considered late for htem,btohqsg
for your thing do they have to write like a letter or?,btohqsg
it is just in the application form,btohqsg
ok then it’s not a big deal. like if they had to write a letter you’d wanna ask at least a month in advance but just listing their name it’s just getting a yes/no,btohqsg
"""life is full of failures but also full of overcoming"" - burette",btohqsg

like i got my jc class yesterday,btohqsg
JC does weird rthings to you,btohqsg
physics (quantum computing). scholarship but got 4-5 years so idw pay 30k for one more sem LOL,btohqsg
One good thing about ip is that you get to be with ur sec sch friends in jc but what no one mentions is that the ppl you have history with also follow you to jc,btohqsg
yeaaaaaa it's 6 years with the same people,btohqsg
yea that’s basically my dhs life lol,btohqsg
by the time sh hit i’m stuck dealing with people idw to see for extra two years,btohqsg
Is it weird to see your friends glow up,btohqsg
oh si yan was oso from dhs,btohqsg
until you see their sec 1 and j2 pics side by side,btohqsg
until u go insta and see past pics,btohqsg
yes that’s why matcha calls me senpai,btohqsg
i think these kinda stats q useless,btohqsg
yea i looked like shit in lower sec,btohqsg
Of these  10 238 students  or 93.9 per cent  got at least three H2 passes  with a pass in General Paper or Knowledge and Inquiry.,btohqsg
actually wats the total cohort size of jcs,btohqsg
eh so the thing is basically theres this guy and we had a really bad past (we used to be friends  like play games and do hw tgt  but stuff happened) then like it all went downhill... i thought he would take physics but no... he's in my class which i never expected cause i always thought he was doing physicsand then like this sounds stupid but whenever i see him i think of y1y2 and then like im not mad at him (i wasnt since 2023) then like i feel very bad cause i miss y1y2 days but then we are nvr gonna be like that againps: we werent in a romantic rs. more of a friendship issue,btohqsg
ya i got 3 H2 passes but in the end almost couldn’t go anywhere also,btohqsg
They should revealed how many get 3 distinctions for H2 and GP,btohqsg

i mean you seem to be doing fine now ig HAHA,btohqsg
for our first H1 chinese lecture i was still excited for what's gonna happen then i rmb we have to 写作文 again and my excitement immediately dissipated,btohqsg
you like my chem cher sia,btohqsg
tbh if he was a girl,btohqsg
yea uni is when i felt a lot more in my zone,btohqsg
the thing is he hurt me very badly,btohqsg
author decided to buff si yan,btohqsg
but like if ntu didn’t take me back then like give me a chance at an admission test,btohqsg
i feel like uni rly help alot of JC ppl to let loose and discover themselves more ngl,btohqsg
rn im not mad at him alr but then i dont think it can go back to in y2 alr,btohqsg
if it can’t then it can’t,btohqsg
They always dun reveal distinctions  they only reveal passes…but if it is EEE/E  where can u go?,btohqsg
Wait oral is still a thing in jc😭,btohqsg
but it’s also like not worth harping on it and letting it mess with you,btohqsg
ok like yk when you break a pot,btohqsg
you can glue the pieces back tgt,btohqsg
my jc class had someone that i fell out with too but we just go about our days as usual,btohqsg
but there will still be cracks in the pot,btohqsg
we even had to work together for class comm stuff but like,btohqsg
Yes:-( but i was lucky coz my prelim qns came out,btohqsg
it's easy to fall out of friendships while you're in school lol,btohqsg
I mean in a few years time  it won't be anything more than just oh bad past  loss of fs which is unfortunately part and parcel of life ah sooo 😬,btohqsg
Maybe if not i will get E alr,btohqsg
yes D/D/D/E also where can you go,btohqsg
life is about winning some and losing some,btohqsg
ur not wrong in y3 i was very hurt and stuff rn im not mad at him anymore but i still feel sad cause im gonna have to see him everyday for the next 1.5 years,btohqsg
yea def but there’s also people that got so used to the JC way and structure esp when it comes to teaching that they took v long to adapt to uni,btohqsg
I think home wun want u also,btohqsg
better to find new pot ngl LOL,btohqsg
So now you're just being extremely nostalgic and you yearn wtv that's happened but hey who knows cheers to better ones amirite,btohqsg
i got alot of other pots,btohqsg
Tbh ppl who fail usually really did not study,btohqsg
"Even though I'm pessimistic and I also think "" man I'll nvr meet someone like that or even better than him again""   but the thing is someone made me think otherwise and I'm doing far btr now",btohqsg
i got alot of friends in the next door class,btohqsg
All thanks to that one person,btohqsg
And a few other side characters,btohqsg
idk how i passed all my A levels even,btohqsg
But in particular damn grateful and appreciative to that one person,btohqsg
Actually idk how y’all hv energy to retake subjects that u didnt do🤣,btohqsg
Coz A levels really gave me burn out,btohqsg
Cause they knew he was too powerful,btohqsg
Me here thinking A level H1 phy easier than O lvl,btohqsg
bedok went from cmeg to cfme,btohqsg
How i tot f needs selection test,btohqsg
it kinda is in certain sense ngl,btohqsg
All the gd things after i leave,btohqsg
2) i didn’t study for A levels,btohqsg
source is i'm a PFMe student in tmjc,btohqsg
But doesnt it cause a bomb,btohqsg
When i was in TM  they only offered CFME,btohqsg
does anyone have the most recent igp?,btohqsg
Huh I thought this is banned,btohqsg
Eh what even  i read on reddit recently someone said tm dun offer PFME,btohqsg
but nobody taking cfme because wwhy,btohqsg
didnt tm refuse to cater cfme for yt,btohqsg
the ICC mods blackboard is the worst,btohqsg
My batch FM is less than a class,btohqsg
but ICC is rly damn bad,btohqsg
btw dhs explicitly disallow cfm cxm xfm,btohqsg
cause the classes for c x f are concurrent,btohqsg
I dun understand why they force 4H2 tho,btohqsg
my batch got 2 classes with computing,btohqsg
the teachers say they open for us out of pity,btohqsg
ok no wonder bc im pre ICC batch,btohqsg
ICC is the bane of my existence,btohqsg
U mean the 3H2 1H1 FM thing?,btohqsg
they say since got 11 ppl alr show interest wld be a shame to turn everyone down,btohqsg
i heard the reason they allow 3H2 Fm now got to do with the new UAS system,btohqsg
Tbh i like the bendy part on MRT,btohqsg
Wait u mean they wanted to not hv fm at all???,btohqsg
by right a class need 15 ppl to start,btohqsg
cant they just have a class where theres fm ppl and chem ppl,btohqsg
so technically 11 ppl only but tmjc decided to open a fm class since fair enough,btohqsg
4H2 class and my class is mixed PCME and PFME,btohqsg
ooh but then you taking h1 econs no,btohqsg
for dhs the h1 subjs all at 1 time,btohqsg
i think you miss the interaction and the friendship  not the person himself...?,btohqsg
So ur batch 1st batch TM offer FM as 3H2 1H1?,btohqsg
like h1 econs h1 math h1 history all same timing,btohqsg
Tutorials all the weird H1 same time I think,btohqsg
my class has 2 ppl taking H1 geog,btohqsg
Depends on if full class take,btohqsg
Im not sure about that but most classes in TM is 1 subject combination,btohqsg
