Hi  I pay for airlines and hotel using standard cc. Now I see the statement is 200 more than I pay on that day. Anyone know what could be the reason? 50 more on air ticket and 150 more on hotel.,btohqsg
I tot the amount is locked in the day I pay.,btohqsg
Very vague. What platform? Local/fx spend? What card?,btohqsg
If charged in fx  locked on the day it's posted. If charged in local  locked on the day of transaction.,btohqsg
Booking.comfor hotel and ANA airline on their website,btohqsg
Like that 200 more.. too ridiculous,btohqsg
You only answered 1 of 3 qn lol,btohqsg
Boojing.comis charge in yen. Ana in sgd.,btohqsg
Anyone know why credit card amount is more for the hotel and airline booking,btohqsg
No info on what CC you're using.Booking.com: use posted date Visa/MC exchange rate (not Google) + 3.25% FX charge (see your card's t&c)ANA: maybe check your invoice receipt if they added the charges? Or see your card's t&c.,btohqsg
Wow.. how u guys book hotel and airline? Using what cc.. cos the fx is too much,btohqsg
"Maybe you can search the chat with ""hotel card"" and ""airline card""",btohqsg
std chart cc charge 3.5% fee for charge in foreign currency  1% for charge in sgd but processed overseas.,btohqsg
Uncertain.. Perhaps can use Amaz + uob lady,btohqsg
no fx fees but there is about 1.9% markup over mastercard conversion rate,btohqsg
Super high. Means I make a mistake using that card. U all use youtrip card for overseas hotel?,btohqsg
youtrip is like 8th down the list,btohqsg
What card u use? I really feel anger by the extra 200 charged. I need learn from mistake,btohqsg
I use more often on agoda due to bank offer rather thenbooking.com,btohqsg
What card is good to be used for Airbnb booking to avoid transaction fees?,btohqsg
Very strange is that the hotel I want book I can‚Äôt find on agoda. But oso got thr extra charges on cc? What card u usually use to book,btohqsg
no joke this one. really is everyday sia,btohqsg
Just came back from Japan  used GXS debit card for some transactions. The rewards are kind of not bad. Would say it‚Äôs better than YouTrip for now as they both use Mastercard foreign exchange rate.,btohqsg
Amex pay lor or use other card link to kopitam app,btohqsg

Advice pls anyone  CPF life  as my mum is 70  cpf asked my mum to start redrawal which she means she will lose about 4% interest rate  any advise for this thanks,btohqsg
Hi all i plan to contribute cpf 8k parents 8k myself  for self contribution portion how much do you guys suggest to split vcma / rstu? im thinking 4k - 4k  thoughts?,btohqsg
GxS card cannot be added to any mobile wallets currently,btohqsg
Depend on bank promo at the time  currently ocbc/dbs/maybank is 18 percent off. Citi 20 percent off limited redemption,btohqsg
They give u cashbacj immediately? So they debit only the amount after cashbacj?,btohqsg
Why would she lose the 4 percent lol  she is already 70 shouldn't she enjoy her fruit of cpf,btohqsg
The full cost will be deducted from your main account. After this transaction  the reward will be instantly credited to your main account.,btohqsg
tbh  it really depends on what you're planning to achieve. For younger groups  i would rather top up my medisave to the max (for future cpf contributions to go into OA and SA) and for older generations  RSTU,btohqsg
The rewards seems good. The cashback. Did u count how many percent?,btohqsg
For 33 dollar u are getting 4.5 back.. that is incredible,btohqsg
