1. 我觉得如果我朋友穿不好的校服，我会尴尬。因为他很丑，disgrace to society.  他也没有consider其他人。他的BO很臭。so disgusting. 他应该follow校规。在meangirls  有人说“we wear pink on tuesday”.如果他没有穿粉红色  他会不尊重规则 被别人欺负，不可以跟他吃饭。,btohqsg
^confirm can get distinction for oral,btohqsg
what i would say in the exam*note: these don't reflect my personal views (i personally couldnt care less if someone was wearing uni or not tbh but im giving politically correct answers aka telling them what they want to hear. also these are v shortened id def yap more irl）1. 我会感到很失望。 因为当我们穿上校服时，是在代表我们的学校。 我们不再是个体，而是学校的一份子。 我们如果不穿好校服，是对学校的一种不敬，也是对我们自身不负责。穿好校服，是对学校基本的尊重2.学校可以时常进行检查， 确保学生穿好校服-也可以让学生领事提醒同学，互相帮忙3.学校-应该机构-要看是什么机构(I lazy write the points for this one),btohqsg
