Pika World Daily Update 18 August 2021Finally  the Drop is HereThe equity market fell across the board. S&P 500 broke the five-day winning streak together with the Dow and Nasdaq falling to. The Russell 2000 had a sharper fall as small caps took immense heat from the various headlines.The Covid is Back on Surface GloballyThe vaccination news was once seen as a light at the end of the tunnel. However  it appears that globally  countries are still taking strict measures to tackle the pandemic. For example  in New Zealand  there is a seven-day lockdown  and Chinese ports are facing problems with the massive shipment backlog and re-routing of routes.It doesn't help that the Delta variant is moving cases to record highs in 5 US states. So while we do not see the current wave as those seen in the pre-vaccine waves  there are profound impacts on individuals and companies  especially those on the services line.Disappointing July Retail SalesThe data was a big shock. A 1.1% decline compared to a 0.3% decline expectation was a sharp miss. While it is just a one-month data  if we look at it holistically with other recent weak data  the peak growth narrative that Pika World has been speaking about appears to be on track  although we are confident of the US growth engine.China Technology RegulationThe latest development in China over the crackdown on internet companies such as Alibaba and Baidu continued to crash Chinese counters as fear mount on the intensifying intrusion into their core business. Coupled with the weakening retail sales and industrial production in China  the market finds it hard to see Asia as a prominent driver of the global recovery narrative.Investors are Walking away. Summer Time is here!As discussed  the summer period often brings a weaker trading activity. In our previous discussion  we spoke about how the rotation across different indices has helped to prop up the stock market. This did not happen yesterday  as most sectors were in risk-off mode.The S&P 500 fell in contrast to its usual resilient nature as the constant rotation often push away any selling pressure. While some buy the dip activity was seen  the elevated valuation could weaken further if investors refused to rotate to other sectors. If that holds  we could see a more prominent sell-off.What's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  We will welcome the Building Permit  which we expect a moderate rise to 1.61 million from 1.59 million in the prior period. This piece of data proves important as we need to see the construction sector vibrancy to determine if the spending power of the economy is softening.At 10.30 pm  the Crude Oil Inventories will be out. However  we do expect a larger drawn down of 1.055 million from the mild all of 0.447million.At 2 am  the FOMC meeting minutes will prove to be a game-changer. Investors are hunting for insights on the heat for tapering to take place  and any clue from the release may change the equity market's trajectory.It is 18 August  Wednesday  8.35 am in Singapore and 8.35 pm in New York. The rough and volatile ride did come as expected yesterday but stay tuned as Pika World brings you the latest insights on the market pulse.,btohqsg
