Anyone feels a nerd coming to ocbc 360?,btohqsg
Good options too but I don‚Äôt really play games so to me those are bad cards,btohqsg
Sad  I really wanted elite miles,btohqsg
Surprised they haven't announced anything yet. But I tink will hav nerd,btohqsg
Maybe not so soon since they still leading in terms of 100k balance compared to uob. Think will see the nerd mid year onwards. Plus they just launched the 2x interest for first two months. If any nerd  probably after this promotion end,btohqsg

Bros... just to check with you guys. Has the 20k miles been credited to your travel 1 statement. I check mine... they say need to wait for June...,btohqsg
you need to give more details for people to give u a substantial answer,btohqsg
Because I apply 3th months ago.,btohqsg
By right this month travel 1 statement should put in 195$ annual fee. And 20k miles was not in my statement also,btohqsg
I applied in Feb  paid my annual fees in MarchGot my miles in about 2 weeks later,btohqsg
The customer service person say you have to wait till end May,btohqsg
Ya highly likely June or July will see some movement. Can‚Äôt really deduce what they going to nerd. At anything below 100k not really good,btohqsg
"Quick question guys. If I apply for the Stan Chart simply cash card first via the singsaver website  and THEN apply for the Stan chart Smart visa credit card next (because it only lets me apply one at a time)  am I still considered a ""new to bank"" member for the Smart Visa card? Because for some reason  I need to spend on the smart visa card instead of the simply cash card to earn the discount from the merchant... thanks in advance for any advice!",btohqsg
Both products are from Standard Chart  so your view do they see you as 1 customer or 2 different customer?,btohqsg

Hi all  amaze x Citi rewards can get 4mpd for MCC 7991 (tourist attractions) ?,btohqsg
7991 not in exclusion list from ml,btohqsg
Cause not risking it ? ü§î,btohqsg

Cause it me automatically routing all my travel spend to UOB ladies instead and keeping all touristy places away from CRMC,btohqsg
Coz that‚Äôs what you do? And doesn‚Äôt mean that mcc doesn‚Äôt earn 4mpd on crmc,btohqsg
Edited based on feedback  pls readhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/201899,btohqsg
I feel as a admin of the group  currently not setting good example on how it reflect if someone give a wrong answer as a admin should you be helping or correcting instead of ridiculing a community member trying to be helpful ?The question when unanswered for quite some time  I came in give a quick answer and yeah I give the wrong answer but you just join in and ridicule me for giving the wrong answer ~ that would lead more people more afraid to give a response ? It seem that more are willing to chime when bashing on people rather then when people asking for assistance.I was about to let it go and move on but seen you as a admin and giving this kind of replies and just clowning on the community members. Yeah it might be a joke but as admin you are setting the precedent for other members to bash and ridicule people for giving the wrong answers. People make mistake  we can acknowledge and move on.,btohqsg
Thank you for your feedback üëçüèª,btohqsg
Do not spread misinformation. 7991 is not excluded from earning 4mpd.Do read up the t&c from CRMC before providing advice.,btohqsg
I totally agreed with you. I don't know where@ChrisHMSGfound this admin and why he was appointed him to be admin. This Melvyn is definitely not setting good example and ruining what Chris has built up so far as a helpful and friendly chatgroup.I think Chris should change the admin and just simply look at all the recent post  he has basically giving clown emoji on so many people's post. If he really doesn't like Terry maybe just ban him instead of tagging clown on literally every post he made.I was looking at some of his own post about nerd here nerd there  he doesn't even know what nerd means and made himself like a clown. I think he was trying to say NERF instead of NERD but he can't even tell the difference. I hope@ChrisHMSGcan salvage this before it get worse.,btohqsg
Hi good morning. Can I confirm if payment through HealthHub (polyclinic) is eligible for UOB EVOL cash back for online category?I heard about it somewhere even it‚Äôs hospital but through HealthHub   it is eligibleThank you,btohqsg
wait a couple of days after transaction posted to be rewarded points,btohqsg
I shared with him on the DBS vantage chat. Is it cause of the $5 spending block?,btohqsg
Just wanna verify  $5 spend means accumulate till $5   or each spend must $5 and abv,btohqsg
So maybe is need to wait for the points to come in a few days laterRead further down:How are DBS Points calculated?,btohqsg
