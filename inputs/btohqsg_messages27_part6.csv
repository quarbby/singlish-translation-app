That means HDB values them / feels that ppl value them equally highly,btohqsg
Up to individual  people feel that top floor can have issues like being hotter + leakage issues if roof draining is bad,btohqsg
not really.Same price but higher 1 floor and 1 less neighbor to deal with.From what I see  people who live top floor say it's better.,btohqsg
Maybe both but you only apply as singles or under senior,btohqsg
are yr parents applying within 4km of Bedok fm current residence?,btohqsg
Things to consider  assuming yr parents eligible for MCPS will yr BIL agree to consent and continue to live within 4km throughout the MOP?,btohqsg
Most of the time sub cons might be the same.. at the end of the day  it's the after sales service must be there.. cannot do finish alr mia got issue can't find ppl,btohqsg
Ya don't need to deal w wet clothes dripping on ur dry clothes  no chair dragging noises or what ever noise.. lol. Coz I'm staying at the highest floor.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check. For MGPS  do parents need to have HFE as well before a sale launch? Or the child needs to have only?,btohqsg
Cause they are also buying a flat  during application time the hfe ref no. will be needed.,btohqsg
the higher you go the better the view (if not blocked)  is it less noise? more windy?,btohqsg
when is Urban Rise at Woodlands launch date?,btohqsg
hihi! would like to check if i‚Äôm applying for this BTO under the MCPS scheme to stay near my parents but they‚Äôre moving to a new BTO (key collection should be around dec this year to early jan next year) but both of the flats are within the 4km range. which flat do i indicate in my application?thanks in advance! üôèüèº,btohqsg
Should be new flat address. They need to stay at the address that qualified you for mcps till your BTO (that you successfully got) MOP period.,btohqsg
More windy but also more dusty. üòÇ I am staying high floor,btohqsg
Hello  can I ask for first timer if is < 1 or exact 1  is it guaranteed means will have a unit?,btohqsg
Is it ok if I click on taking housing loan from hdb during application but later i decide not to?,btohqsg
Thanks@wmaa68for your reply ..Can I ask anyone who knows theDistribution QuotaPublic Scheme1st Timer Family2nd Timer FamilyMarried Child Priority Scheme1st Timer Family2nd Timer Family,btohqsg
For Sales of Balance let‚Äôs say the flat is in some Prime area or Plus area like for example AMK  under sales of balance  it will still be 5 years MOP rite?,btohqsg
If it has gone under the new classification  then the new classification applies.,btohqsg
In the future? The new rules apply if the BTO/SBF are under the new classification.,btohqsg
If it was never under the new classification  then there‚Äôs no bearing for resale.,btohqsg
Ahh okay thanks! Guess that‚Äôs the only plus point of getting resale,btohqsg
Hello everyone  first time buyer here. We applied for the sales launch and the exercise closed ytd. When will we get our ballot numbers?,btohqsg

4 Room Bedok Town1236 Units5145 ApplicantsFor 1st Timer95% = About 1176 Unit ?2.7 RatioFor 2nd Timer5%set aside to choose either Bayshore Palm/Bayshore Vista/Kembangan= About Total of 60 Units only?32.0 ratio x 60= 1920 2nd Timer applying for 60 unitsIs this correct ?,btohqsg
1236 Units of 4 Room BedokAnyone Know how manyQ number given out ?,btohqsg
Up to 3x the available supply,btohqsg
Why ? Is better u get or u don't have any Q numbers u know why ? Nowadays rather get Q or don't because if ur Q is out of supply and kenna call u also must go select if not ur application ongoing all cancelled if u never go plus penalty if never select unless less than 10 units available can appeal the penalty,btohqsg
So 1236 Units of Q number + about 2000 more Q Number in case some give up the 4 years?@berningbrightlythank you for your reply,btohqsg
"Could you clarify what you mean by ""in case some give up the 4 years relationship""? I wanna see if we're on the same page before I respond",btohqsg
4 years is really long time even time fly ...anyway Good Luck to all Applicants,btohqsg
Hi  my seller had already claimed it  but NEA had a very detailedforms.govfor you to fill up. Took 2.5 weeks for mine to be approved,btohqsg
Can I ask for Senior like our parents who bought our childhood flat in the early 80'sBut did NOT loanAre they still consider 2nd Timer or is it still 1st Timer because never loan from HDB ?,btohqsg
They will give a max of 1236 x 3 = 3708 queue numbers. Could also be fewerWhen selection starts  they will call from #1  #2 etc. If everyone selects  then after #1236  there will be no more units. But if some people don't select  eg if #100 doesn't want to select  then #1237 will get to select.If you don't get to select at this point  and HDB closes the selection  the only way to get this flat is to apply through SBF / OBF if they release it then. These flats could be leftover (units ppl didn't want) or given-up (eg break up)I hope I interpreted your question correctly...,btohqsg
Yes exactly good answers to my questions...thank you@berningbrightly,btohqsg
no dont add up to 100% as 5% is for 2nd timer,btohqsg
without mcps for 2nd timer the quota is actually 2%,btohqsg
Strange tcps not in the table,btohqsg
‚Ä¢ Provides an additional ballot chance to secure a flat,btohqsg
‚Ä¢ Up to 5% of Build-To-Order (BTO) and Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) flats allocated for families with at least 3 childrenProvides an additional ballot chance to secure a flat,btohqsg
2nd timer for BTO but 1st timer for loan which is subject to income and age eligibility,btohqsg
Ok good Q number  to All,btohqsg
Thank youDory...2% to that Very lucky 2nd Timer here ..come December please share your Good News !,btohqsg
"It's not additional ballot  it's like your name will be put into 2 ""bowls"" (MCPS and ""normal"" bowl)So you have 2 tries for them to draw a number for you from the bowls. Maybe balloting with the MCPS will end up giving you a better queue number?",btohqsg
The results will be the better number,btohqsg
Not yet. I am only getting house on the 6 Nov  ü§£,btohqsg
