Some unexpected dents and scratches on the rims also just realise 🙃,btohqsg
But I doubt you'll get anything out of it,btohqsg
This isn't something to fight on after 2 months of the purchase,btohqsg
Need to check when you took over the car,btohqsg
And they can easily argue you caused those curb rashes,btohqsg
But highly lightly is won’t get anything right?,btohqsg
Because you signed the contract and accepted the vehicle as is,btohqsg
They are only liable to engine and gearbox warranty for 6 months,btohqsg
Or any big mechanical failures can be discussed,btohqsg
Hmmm alright! Thanks for the info!,btohqsg
It’s working WITH the system! 😉,btohqsg
PPI is everything and one needs to point all that out bah at that stage,btohqsg
Maybe@SGCM_Admincan come up with a PPI checklist for car buyers (if not already done so). These three PPI letters have been mentioned by many community brothers and sisters many times too.,btohqsg
Redraw winners1.@valarieyyt2.@origiri3.@holaatmeting4.@jaavaann5.@kenchanahWe will DM you shortly to claim your passes!,btohqsg
Looks like they just copy paste the accessories list because the avante isn't running an Android head unit,btohqsg

Ya just change the rims can alr,btohqsg
Oh and your rims aren't diamond cut,btohqsg
So repairs for the curb rash should be easy,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA can okay~ Maybe start next week onwards hehe - E,btohqsg
Cause I already scheduled for this week ~ - E,btohqsg
Better to plan in advance than to be late 🥹 - E,btohqsg

And get E a f33 4 series or an e93 M3,btohqsg
And increase budget for E's car purchase funding HEHEHEHEHEE - E,btohqsg
and wanna change my bodykit. the bodykit now is ugly... i didn't know theres the N-line kind of bodykit... not sure whether can i get a trade in or something,btohqsg
Wheels and tyres still decent trade in,btohqsg
There is an N-line and full fledged N variant in the global markets but we don't get that here,btohqsg
yea but i have seen existing avante with those n-line bodykits,btohqsg
Komoco didn't offer n line avantes in Singapore,btohqsg
Aftermarket means not legal in sg?,btohqsg
As long as they conform to width and height regulations,btohqsg
But just rare to get in singapore?,btohqsg
More rare compared to a stock avante? Yes.,btohqsg
But rare in terms or hard to get? No.,btohqsg
Go to any bodykit shop and they can usually order one in for you and install with paint,btohqsg
The rare/hard to get bodykits are those that are custom ones like a liberty walk kit or customer widebody kits,btohqsg
Takes longer to order and get those in and costs much more,btohqsg
Regular upkits for Hyundai n line  Merc AMG upkit  bmw m upkits  Audi RS kits are quite common,btohqsg
Customized bodykits cost more compared to universal kits.,btohqsg
And you don't have one vendor to choose from as many copy the same kit and sell as well,btohqsg
if u got the budget  go for customised. looks nicer,btohqsg
i usually see CN7 with universal,btohqsg
so seeing one w a customised might just turn some heads haha,btohqsg
Yea I think N line bodykit is chio enough,btohqsg
Yes because anything more a bit much already,btohqsg
