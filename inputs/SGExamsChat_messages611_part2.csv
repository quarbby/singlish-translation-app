I wasn't taught by pillai but from what I heard about him  he can't teach for shit,btohqsg
Like everytime I walk past his class,btohqsg
Oh my fucking god my Cher say his style is diff but overall good Cher leh,btohqsg
But itz OK econs is self grindable,btohqsg
Oh maybe I'm fake news but that was my observations ah,btohqsg
But thx tho I'll take note of ur words big bro,btohqsg
Is it the same as before,btohqsg
sorry  everyone  I am staying behind in PU1. Hence  you will be taught by another teacher for this year. His style is different from mine but he is a good teacher. You guys keep up the good study habits and you will be great.:),btohqsg
Yea she say she left sch to exp other pathways and she said she taught pri sch sec sch and preferred to teach tertiary edu cause pupil r more mature,btohqsg
The only HDL I can treat is HDL DIY hotpot,btohqsg
Uh gimme a range like from $x-y?,btohqsg
Ngl if u send me anything,btohqsg
I can probably try and help,btohqsg
Or I will probably try and help,btohqsg
But my return time has like dramatically decreased,btohqsg
Cuz I have too many students sending me stuff,btohqsg
First thing first   like any good pupil I gotta figure whr I fk up,btohqsg
U can send me ur pu1 work,btohqsg
I can try and figure out,btohqsg
It cannot be worse than what I'm reading rn rite?,btohqsg
I wasn't in my best performance,btohqsg
"U don't write stuff like ""women belong in the kitchen""",btohqsg
Uh what else is thr that I read recently,btohqsg
"""Religion is not relevant because there are people who do not have religions""",btohqsg
Is that really written by a human,btohqsg

IP kids won't say there's a JAE-IP divide,btohqsg
Which is why I also won't comment abt it in ej,btohqsg
Cuz not my place to say,btohqsg
I want to believe there isn't (because I'm very close to the Jae people) but idk la at the end of the day,btohqsg
my mentees friends got mix of both,btohqsg
last time when dhs was pure ip and no jae we had one class for o level track,btohqsg
I think in general rite the divide manifests in terms of opportunities rather than friendgrps,btohqsg
basically those cmi in y2 ones,btohqsg
Like who is in council/house comm etc,btohqsg
most people are chill but there’s def some that’ll feel they failures lol,btohqsg
In EJ I used to be a big problem,btohqsg
But I think they recently implemented a quota,btohqsg
jae gets offered the same chances but it’s q obvious coming from IP side has loads of benefits just by knowing people,btohqsg
I mean at least the student is trying to improve him/her self,btohqsg
