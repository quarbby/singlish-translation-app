Yup and to clear the airI ain't a long term holder in MTJust riding the waves and why I keep talking about MT very obvious MT can have the most swing in a day someone mentioned can up down 10 pips in one day.That's why when people ask me join MT chat I didn't because I was ashamed to as I am no long term holder.,btohqsg
Have some 168 lots on contra . So hopefully it runs sooner rather than later.,btohqsg
Mine 40.5 - 100 lots . 385 - 68 lots.Hope can come out unscathed or even some profits as contra play onlyYesterday closed decent. Sentiments okay I think got chance. Watched for a while. A lot of collection done actually imo.,btohqsg

Just read news  Korean BTS stock plunges 20 plus %. A lot of buyers are first timer.Jialat .,btohqsg
Korean BTS is just full of hype....,btohqsg
Y write off just based on 1 day results?Maybe Korea entertainment industry will be similar to what rubber industry is to Malaysia...Many examples of ipo shares drop n raise... look at Alibaba..Xiaomi..,btohqsg
Maybe...who knows...time will tell....I just say that from the sponsor promoting point of view  it is alot of hype especially the fans all got drawn into it.,btohqsg
Too bad the share price dropped,btohqsg
Haha..mb the fans dun even care about share price...they just want to be a part of BTS....Their dividend is not $$$... is to meet BTS in person,btohqsg
Ya...exactly lor....BTS fan fever....capitalising on this lor,btohqsg
These days....stocks go up for so many other reasons - beyond the textbook norm,btohqsg
Mostly are youngsters  where did they get the money to invest?,btohqsg
Interested to hear the view of our youngsters.,btohqsg
Just like dot com days...loss making companies have skyrocketing valuations...even now...is the future earnings priced in current share price? Got guarantee profits?,btohqsg
Dun belittle youngsters.....the lucky ones...parent$$..The ambitious ones..maybe got online business or live video or whatever new online platform there is...I uncle I dunnoBut I think youngsters these days got more chance to make money if they want,btohqsg
Not belittling the youngsters  just curious.,btohqsg
I dont think @si cario is belittling them.I know for a fact that alot of uni undergrads are making $10k a month buying into limited items and reselling them. They are smart business kids,btohqsg
Ok wrong choice of words. My  bad,btohqsg
I still enjoy the trill of playing shares.Hahaha.,btohqsg
I watched a documentary on CNA a few weeks/months back. Many young Koreans are actually living on credit and in debt.,btohqsg
Wah that is as much as a graduate tutor salary,btohqsg
Plz add  me to MT  UG  riverstone and TG support group,btohqsg
How to pay condo in cash?,btohqsg
I certainly dont have $6 mil,btohqsg
"https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/trending/savvy-singaporean-homeowners-score-good-property-deals-13119980PROPERTY TIP #3: ON SAVING MONEYPeiyu  37  mother of one: ""Try not to take loans as they will incur debt. Instead  borrow from your parents – they don’t charge interest and you can pay them at a comfortable pace.""",btohqsg
Siaoness. My parents wont lend me a single cent.,btohqsg
I am $4mil in debt. Downpaid $2m with husband.,btohqsg
Since you are interested maybe I can give some insightFor guys - NS pay is about 800 to 1k a mth  so if you stay in like me and don't go to canteen everyday  don't chiong and hang flower  by the end of NS can save about 10k to 15kFor both male and female undergrads  some do part time jobs like tuition  some do research studies (like me  I do clinical trials because I earn the most amt of money from them) and some females... I won't mince my words la  some go looking for sugar daddies,btohqsg
But 10k a mth is very rare if at all. Maybe if they trade forex  or give tuition everyday or something. Realistically I think 2k max from part time jobs for undergrads,btohqsg
My cousin is earning 3k/mth in Uni by teaching tuition.,btohqsg
If tuition teach everyday  how to study?,btohqsg
This one will have to do group tuition. Not easy to find a group nowadays from what I hear. Usually  it's 1 on 1 or 1 on 2,btohqsg
It is one to one tuition.,btohqsg
Now a lot of tuition over Zoom 😂,btohqsg
These kids are very resourceful.My relative's son in American Intl sch...you know the intl sch is in Woodlands  so they live in orchard area and school bus picks them up.And cos it is a long bus ride  he goes to ntuc and buys chocs and snacks  break bulks them and sell them to other students on the bus for a premium (like cheers and 7-11 😅)That is how he pays for his Tod's shoes 😅😅,btohqsg
Maybe that's why can teach many subjects,btohqsg
Wow that's quite high. Usually the rate is around 25 to 30 per hour for undergrads teaching sec sch or pri sch. If teaching A levels or undergrad level  maybe top up about 5 per hour,btohqsg
Lol when someone appear start talking aboutTuitionProperty buyingFinancial freedomBlah blahSiren soundsPee poo pee poo,btohqsg
Uh no. He only applies 40 per hr and above.,btohqsg
But I also don't get why need tuition at undergrad level. There are so many TAs and profs,btohqsg
No i can show you whatsapp ss,btohqsg
Very rare to come across 40 per hr and above for undergrads. Usually they'll pay this rate for grads or MOE teachers,btohqsg
Not every month la...if they can source for limited edition shoes or something overseas  they buy them and sell in msia and mark up dam high. Got market one you know.See my comment on my relative kid in american school 😅,btohqsg
It's okay la no need. I'm in some tuition groups on Telegram also  so I see the rates quite often. 40per hour I would say is an outlier,btohqsg
Maybe he chose higher rate? He is scholar at Ntu.,btohqsg
And also teaches at tuition ctr,btohqsg
Ya recently news got that sec sch kid that resell shoes. Very savvy,btohqsg
Tuition center is not worth it as just 40 per hour for small group,btohqsg
Omg...if at undergrad still need tuition??!!! I dunno wat to say leow...sori...that is just my opinion...no offence to anyone hor,btohqsg
Aiya got such a high paying job  esp in this job market  tao chio alr la.,btohqsg
Ownself talk ownselfImagine a bb group buy sell same stock to top volume attract attentionActually ownself churnSomething like that now la,btohqsg
So the sequence nowadays isTuition properties financial freedomThen a healthy dose of kkj,btohqsg
Ah I see. Anyway  I agree it's a red flag 🤭,btohqsg
Some people need for year 1 like maths or computing because they have very little background in A level maths for instance. I myself from Poly - the profs expect us to know A level maths syllabus even though in poly I only covered maybe 60 or 70 percent of the A level syllabus,btohqsg

US coronavirus: The country reported its most cases in a day since July. Deaths may begin climbing  too  a leading expert says - CNNhttps://www.cnn.com/2020/10/17/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html,btohqsg
This Eindec is getting interesting. Closed with a bullish engulfing pattern n price  end up at the edge of the triangle. Resistance at 104 on chart. Friday day end matching also saw someone don't wanna let it close above 104. MACD histogram still turning up in the positive zone. This is an ang mo candle setup with a potential target of 132. I see more upside this week. If Monday open at least 105 then high chance will go above 110.,btohqsg
For medtecs holders. This chart not updated one. Price till Thursday but still usable. The uptrend trendline is the last critical support. Broke this line probably is sayonara already. Take note that there's a bearish pattern formed. Not saying that price will definitely toh. But if price close below the trendline  I think it's safer to exit... Dyodd. Just my 2-cents.,btohqsg
Am i right to say that medtecs is a high risk stock now.,btohqsg
This is Gordon Goh Wei Xue aka Equanimity,btohqsg
Not yet. If price come near to the trendline then risk increased.,btohqsg

"I long on Ug but if MT huat...Ug also huat....so I support MT and UG....💰💰💰History on MT for me is restricted stock  so must call broker.  Broker answer my call - ""eh...MT want to buy ah...BBs play one...some more restricted stock...."" then he sniggered.I already sien....also pantang...dare not go in.  My bad....haha",btohqsg
I think you know your counters better than your broker.If bad call  just blame yourself.,btohqsg
Isdn Cup with Handle pattern still valid. I hold on to my belief that this pattern will help break 410 resistance.,btohqsg
Chartist very good. How do u see all the different patterns..I dunno a thing about chart...last night u sent a head n shoulder...this morning sent a cup with handle...The way u able to differentiate them is damn good...Both look same to me.this cup looks like a H&S to me too...山...Maybe Chinese will call it a mountain formation...got such thing or not,btohqsg
It was on head & shoulder (black) but resisted up trendline (blue). Black neckline still crucial for cut off.,btohqsg
This has new higher lows  all Moving Averages are above the lower timeframe. The uptrend has not been broken yet,btohqsg
Look at the recent PA  the probability to break up is quite good. 🙏🏻,btohqsg

It's okay  thanks for the heads up though. Maybe because I didn't do A levels and not a scholar  plus no experience in tutoring so I can't command a high rate. Earning quite a good pay as a Research assistant however 😂 putting 100% of my pay into Medtecs. Huat ah medtecs!,btohqsg

Hospital is not a “clean “ place  must work in harmonious place.Patients life  fellow colleagues don’t make mistake  etc.Pantang things  we just avoid.Just like in the stock market  we want positive energy and don’t talk rubbish.   Too much at stake.,btohqsg
