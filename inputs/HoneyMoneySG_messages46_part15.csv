I think if you are paying for your CareShield Life and Integrated Shield Plan using MA its worth doing VCMA before RSTU.This means that you are basically using cash to pay the premiums for both  and then getting a tax deduction.This is of course  compared to RSTU where you can do SA shielding (or if not trying to game the system)  SA->RA to pay for your CPF Life annuity premium,btohqsg

"The term ""nerf"" is often used in the context of gaming and refers to reducing the power  effectiveness  or strength of a particular item  ability  character  or game element. When something is ""nerfed "" it means it has been intentionally weakened or toned down in order to balance the game or address issues of imbalance or unfairness. The term originates from the brand name ""Nerf "" which is a popular line of foam-based toys and sports equipment known for being safe and less likely to cause harm or damage. In gaming  ""nerfing"" is akin to softening or cushioning the impact of a specific feature to maintain a more balanced and enjoyable experience for all players. In finance  it's not appropriate to be used. Likely someone used it and the others blindly follow.",btohqsg
