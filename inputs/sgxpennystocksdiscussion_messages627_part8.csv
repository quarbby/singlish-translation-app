Got fail until straight U or not,btohqsg
my teacher told my mom I should just give up and go sweep the road,btohqsg
A level .. no A and B,btohqsg
She doesn't know all these but she got A1 for English and Chinese,btohqsg
then I somehow got the best improvement award...,btohqsg
Then let her express her language talents ah,btohqsg
so much easier to get than the top performer award,btohqsg
Sinkapore don't know how to appreciate these one,btohqsg
Stay in Singapore only sink more,btohqsg
Ask her go study Arts  she go study Chem  asking for trouble,btohqsg
Chinese good then go Shanghai XiaoLongBao,btohqsg
A1 in chinese but go hawker centre ask me how to order food in chinese,btohqsg
Next time the world speaks RenMinBi and PuTongHua,btohqsg
Surprisingly A level got some Bs,btohqsg
Nua is like me.. last 2 months then study,btohqsg
She always very last min  very risky,btohqsg
already can see she is too smart for local craps,btohqsg
last min also too early in her world,btohqsg
You are looking at her from the lens of an adult,btohqsg
Think same  O level also like this. L1R5 for O level about half of prelim,btohqsg
Next thing you will tell me is psle score,btohqsg
she will be scared of herself if she really serious,btohqsg
When young let them enjoy sua,btohqsg
Why always so last min ah?,btohqsg
Singapore education is self pawn one,btohqsg
In the end Singapore student get B and C,btohqsg
But overseas student all get A and B cause exam easier,btohqsg
No  still got many straight A  so they need make difficult,btohqsg
The world care the final grade,btohqsg
years of trainings to obey instructions,btohqsg
18 years too late for that,btohqsg
Those straight A are...one of a kind,btohqsg
I don't need that  only want them to do enough to get to next level,btohqsg
that's why how to be serious?,btohqsg
Really next level don't fail can already,btohqsg
Come out also 1 cert  who cares is A or B,btohqsg
So SUTD  SIT  SUSS all CMI one?,btohqsg
Only NUS  NTU and SMU ok?,btohqsg
fwah... so dangerous to recommend any local craps,btohqsg
My info is 5 to 10 years outdated one btw,btohqsg
ok  ok  thanks. My time only got NUS and NTU  now so many choices I'm very confused,btohqsg
next 40 years also cannot reverse the mistakes,btohqsg
no need to be confused  just choose from any top 10 or 15 uni in the world,btohqsg
and none from SG for good reasons,btohqsg
No money  can only afford local,btohqsg
go Malaysia U or Indonesia U  or even Thailand also good,btohqsg
I can only say Singapore Uni is too competitive,btohqsg
the best feature in NUS is... toilets are enough,btohqsg
Think I gave wrong advise. I told her to apply the 3 and SUSS in case can't get into all 3 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Nus n ntu r e top 15 uni le,btohqsg
