It brings shame According to my parents,btohqsg
Alternatively  drop out and sign as a private candidate.,btohqsg
You won't be able to go jc ..,btohqsg
Like they say shit like your a chinese,btohqsg
Ye my parents say those who are Chinese and can't speak Chinese brings shame,btohqsg
And you can't even speak chinese,btohqsg
i mean post sec anywhere got stress la lol,btohqsg
Even malay ppl can speak better or some shit,btohqsg
It is what it is  you drop out from secondary school and register as a private candidate.,btohqsg
tbh I wish yall happy memories,btohqsg
That's if you want to go to jc.,btohqsg
Wait till u go uni chem,btohqsg

regardless of the results u get,btohqsg
the attitude u have at work,btohqsg
I mean  personally i speak mandarin at home l,btohqsg
is what determines ur career prospects,btohqsg
I've never seen a private candidate who has done better than they have for their school's exams,btohqsg
its the hardest h2 subject lol,btohqsg
My parents find clips on Facebook of foreigners speaking Chinese and comparing them to me,btohqsg
a degree or diploma is just a starting point,btohqsg
just to get to the door,btohqsg
Chemistry will be hard in jc though,btohqsg
i thgt this was econs at first glance,btohqsg
Have u tried to pick up mandarin tho,btohqsg
It's like trying to say you are a English blood person who doesn't know how to speak  English,btohqsg
h2 math and h2 bio easier,btohqsg
Nah is the easiest for me  hardest shld be h1 gp,btohqsg
Cause I never learn organic chem,btohqsg
jc was probs the most fulfilling time I can remember,btohqsg

Well its easy so im enjoying,btohqsg
Nah not really they just happen to get the clips really often,btohqsg
Bell curve in uni not fun HAHA,btohqsg
Unless every1 doesnt do well for exams,btohqsg
30/80 for an A grade for a mod,btohqsg
The Vietnam scholars in my class are very smart though,btohqsg
and serve to remind u of a time when u could in a way  do the impossible,btohqsg
if u remember the hours and dedication u put into ur craft in that period,btohqsg
honestly im considering taking h3 bio,btohqsg
it's something to be v proud of,btohqsg
But a lot of ppl die-ded,btohqsg
i feel its more of passion than anything else  i personally enjoy bi,btohqsg
How do you enjoy bio without enjoying chemistry,btohqsg
Yes bio has a bit of chem,btohqsg
My fren took some life sci modTheres pka pkb knowledge,btohqsg

When in poly or JC  bio has a lot of chemistryüòè,btohqsg
and never wanted to touch engineering,btohqsg
