Shanghai's top infectious diseases expert  Zhang Wenhong  has told state media the megacity may have entered its peak period on Dec 22  with an estimated 10 million residents having contracted COVID-19.Leaked notes from a meeting of health officials last month revealed they believed 250 million people had been infected across China in the first 20 days of December.Independent infection models paint a grim picture. University of Hong Kong researchers have estimated nearly 1 million Chinese may die this winter as a result of opening up.And health risk analysis firm Airfinity forecast 11 000 deaths and 1.8 million infections per day  with a total of 1.7 million fatalities by the end of April.,btohqsg
