Audi's little compact has something for everyone  even the slightly unhingedWhether you're looking for sensible every day motoring or road ripping brutal performance  this little compact Audi can do it all.👉🏻 React with 🥰 if you agree the Audi A3 is a versatile car!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
But a bit sad ah.. started out with same engine as s3... until now 1.0L haha,btohqsg
Haha its like getting a s22fe same same but cheaper,btohqsg
Anyone tried and tested those K&n air filters? Good for performance and fuel economy?,btohqsg
dont do that. doesnt do anything,btohqsg
fuel economy is governed by engine oil quality and how clean the internal are. piston crowns valve deposits etc,btohqsg
stick to original paper filter. best filtration,btohqsg
Later got one bmw pop pop,btohqsg
One is J and one is R,btohqsg
I think he don’t qualify. Both car and driver too young 🤣🤣,btohqsg
not true  some of them do improve air flow especially for turbocharged cars. but of course it doesn't do much by itself  you do need to upgrade more parts and do a tune up for more result.,btohqsg
Don’t need waste money on such   if really want just buy a bigger power car or a used 1 that come with it,btohqsg
Some people take pleasure in modding their cars from scratch ma  just personal preference,btohqsg
As i get older i also prefer cars that are already done up because lazy,btohqsg

The leg room at the back a bit.... narrow.,btohqsg
"Bigger power carprice different is ""super power"" level 😂Not like Malaysia 😅",btohqsg
I would usually prefer stock higher performance car from factory anytime because they are already properly engineered and done up as a system.,btohqsg
How is it? Felt any difference,btohqsg
no eyes c...almost hit quota ceiling,btohqsg
Also many get the k&n filter as it lasts slightly longer and you can clean and reuse as compared to the regular paper filter,btohqsg
These days gotta consider price also lmao. Heavily consider,btohqsg
And save a lot of time and trouble,btohqsg
Gone are the days where can spend weeks dekitting before selling lol,btohqsg
The effort is just too much for me,btohqsg
I only wash my car once a month,btohqsg
Noooo. You don’t ask you maid to wash everyday ?,btohqsg
Actually maids are not supposed to wash car,btohqsg
That’s what I said. Serves no purpose at all. Of it really works you won’t see engineers design turbo or higher cc car,btohqsg
Air filter thingy is for wannabe,btohqsg
Some SG employer very cruel one.One helper profile that I saw. She wash 4 cars 😅I wash myself also feel shag. Gives professional wash better.😅,btohqsg
need to do stage 2 to see any effect as your air sensor is factory,btohqsg
need to get recharge kit to consider proper reuse. cannot just wash and reuse,btohqsg
Maid don’t wash car as not within the job scope,btohqsg
At that point use closed pod air intake already. Replacement filter cannot provide sufficiently low temp air or sufficient air flow for the application,btohqsg
K&N without a tune will increase hp by 0.25 but will lose low end torue by maybe 10nm... doesnt sound like a worthy trade off to me,btohqsg
Do K&N shld at least do a tune  maybe exo and the mod list goes one,btohqsg
i type the message 3 times and it got deleted 3 times,btohqsg
