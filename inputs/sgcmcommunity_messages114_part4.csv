Always heard that lesser known contis parts availability may be an issue and cost higher  how bad is it now ah? Saw some 2nd hand Citroen/ Peugeot depre still within my range. Not considering any brands in particular I only filter depre,btohqsg
I go for a nap and come back 300+ messages lol,btohqsg
Not that bad actually  only some parts stockists may not have or need order  leading to longer down time. If you just need a people hauler  just get Japanese brand for a piece of mind. Citroen and Peugeot not particularly known for reliability,btohqsg
Selling civic fc bumper and mods,btohqsg

is there any possibility to steal fuel from a car?,btohqsg
Odd question. But there is always ways to do it.,btohqsg
hmm...i just realised i lost 2.2km worth of oil,btohqsg
Well.. the ECU does calculate based on many variables.. Such as current fuel consumption  how many L left. 2.2km is very little amount to steal so it is likely the ECU had just re-calculated,btohqsg
but in a span of 6 hours  there can be variance?,btohqsg
End of the day still need use ur Mileage/fuel used,btohqsg
i sent the car to the workshop on 12 noon  leaving 626km worth of fuel,btohqsg
