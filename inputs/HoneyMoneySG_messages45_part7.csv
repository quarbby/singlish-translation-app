Oh so next time if u sell house  dont need to pay back the grant?,btohqsg
Idk actl any other gurus here can answer? My house doesnt even exist yet I havent even gotten to thinking about selling lmao,btohqsg
what kind of house did you get? normal 5 year MOP BTO? or 10 year PLH BTO?anyway both will not need you to repay housing grants  as long as you satisfy the MOP.,btohqsg
If have 500k cash will u pay off mortgage or put in high interest bank accounts?,btohqsg
well it depends on what is your mortgage rate... if you locked in a good rate for a few years.. then don't repay first,btohqsg
Whichever helps you sleep better at night,btohqsg
what i can suggest is you go shop around now.. see what is the fixed rate for 1 or 2 years housing loan u can get... then if lower than 4%  you can still play the savings account game for that same period,btohqsg
if you can lock in 3.7% for 2 years... then your $500k cash put in savings account is better isn't it?,btohqsg
Yeah looking ard now  bachelor thinking of selling n move to another location in sg,btohqsg
Icic..need to find smth with better yield like hsbc or ocbc div,btohqsg
Will u consider buy one more property with the 500k?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA seems to be going strong still. but you need to control 2 accounts to play musical chairs and you can enjoy 5%+ p.a. savings account interest,btohqsg
Went down raffles place branch at 930am but q seems long and gg to take 1+hr to open account. Maybe go down again tmr to try,btohqsg
im thinking if more people signing up for HSBC EGA is a good thing (they will maintain high rates longer) or a bad thing (they will lower rates soon).,btohqsg
Can  but mine got bug  keeps rejecting my application online coz maybe i had hsbc cards before,btohqsg
Looking at ocbc div+ also 4.4% first firdt 3 mths,btohqsg
you need to put back to your cpf. the money is still yours(if you are the gang that feels cpf is your money),btohqsg
alot of people that i know thought that need to return grant to government so they dont bother applying for it  but please do. you only need to return it to your cpfoa with accrued interest which is still your money,btohqsg
So the grant is from hdb?,btohqsg
I use the hsbc calculator online and it only have high interest if 100k and few other spending,btohqsg
yes at the point of choosing flat the officer should ask you whether you want to apply for any grant. during my time is combined income above 5k then dont qualify anymore. i think now they increase it so can get more grants. new ruling is need to submit past 12 months payslip for their review,btohqsg
