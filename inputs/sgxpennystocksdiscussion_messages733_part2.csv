Today high chance will be ultra bullish. Stay tuned and be ready for hoot.It finally Seems like market have the backing to do a more sustained rally with the support of yesterday data reported.Yesterday was the first actual day of the rally as many stocks have smart money flow into it .Looking forward to more.Watch out the below closely.Top picks1) Parkson Retail ($0.049)- Consumer cyclicals stock which would be benefit from easing inflation as consuming spending naturally increase. Yesterday alone  up 7.25%2) Marco Polo ($0.043)- Broke out yesterday of $0.042 finally and expected to open $0.044 or $0.045 today as many stocks will gap up.- should test $0.048 anytime3) GEO energy($0.380)- quite obvious they are flushing out retailers at $0.375 for those who bought in earlier on failed break out $0.410 to $0.420.- their results generally did okay 👌🏻 with a slightly lesser interim dividend announced $0.01- yesterday big fight at $0.375 and many retailers have cut but there was still so many hidden buyers appearing which shows hidden hands collection- company did share buy backs $0.370. Hence to buy at $0.375  there is psychological support 1 level below which is main reason why I believe MMs decided to collect back chips $0.375Dark horses picks1) Sanli ($0.108)- betting stellar results and upcoming contract award by PUB (based on Gebiz pending award)- Temasek heliconia investment is $0.1672) Oxpay Financial ($0.135)- increasing focus on Fintech space- broke up of downtrend line and price have stabilised above $0.130 finally- it fell fast and the liquidity supply mainly above $0.18 hence it can fly up real fast when in play3) G Invacom ($0.055)- penny tech play as tech rebound led the market yesterday4) Sunrise ($0.036)- have noticed collection- back tested and Merril Lynch was buying- yesterday  added $0.037 and an algo buyer appeared after the flipped up5) Vividthree ($0.033)- just too bottomed out counter- ETH bouncing up 20% whilst Bitcoin 10% today should pull this one up,btohqsg

Good read here on GEO Energy here. Clear and concise statementsI believe after this round of flushing you will not be seeing Geo at $0.3x level. They should be heading to $0.4x series once they done with ridding us retailers out. Quite obvious they are doing that now.,btohqsg
