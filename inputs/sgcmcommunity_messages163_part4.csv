Hi all  may I know how much I can expect to pay to change wheel bearing? I see forum some say all in 100-300 while some say is like 200+ per wheel,btohqsg
Labour differ from ws to ws also,btohqsg
I see mine is an Altis  not sure where to get it change haha,btohqsg
The people that I know insist I go back to the dealer where I buy it from and quote lemon law  but wheel bearing is like wear and tear I think hard to fight  so considering to go outside settle myself,btohqsg
I changed my front two for my civic fd was 320 iirc,btohqsg
Anyway they got put there big big no cover wheel bearing,btohqsg
And just nice when have issue is the wheel bearing lol,btohqsg
I guess they experienced enough to exclude it from their T&C,btohqsg
I see  both 320 or each?,btohqsg
Some dealer rec de ws nt gud,btohqsg
Just go yr usual ws n repair bah,btohqsg
Usually warranty not on wear n tear. For engine n gear box only.Even if buy new car  warranty dont cover wear n tear,btohqsg
Yeah I also think so  wear and tear very hard to claim haha,btohqsg
