I remember we have a hellcat but idk where it went,btohqsg
and a chevrolet impala  '62 if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
I don't think a hellcat or charger is worth the import + rhd swap,btohqsg
all the dodge u see on the roads are most likely Malaysia registered,btohqsg

Any hellcat that is RHD is likely a AUS conversion,btohqsg

Koenigsegg is not a fan of making track only cars or race cars,btohqsg
