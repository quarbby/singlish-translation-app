Sometimes ecu range will drop  but idt it will drop dis much.,btohqsg
that's why i asking if one can siphon,btohqsg
cos fuel now very exp ma,btohqsg
Depends on the job you did.. If they disconnect the battery  the ECU could have really lost all the previous calculated values before and these are it's new estimate.,btohqsg
So what did you get done at WS.,btohqsg
i can't curse and swear over here  rite?,btohqsg
Siphon also that is little to even siphon out..Not worth.ECU calculate also not 100% one... You leave it idle for a few hours turn it on the values can jump one.,btohqsg
Use short forms and special characters,btohqsg
ok...let's hope they can't be this cheapo la hor?,btohqsg
No lah want steal steal whole tank le lah,btohqsg
of cos not whole tank la,btohqsg
See 5 litre also go jail,btohqsg
It is all depending on the current air fuel mixture  engine conditions and other things. It is likely you drive more later you will see the value stuck higher for awhile.,btohqsg
they siphon bit by bit. a full jerry can,btohqsg
Steal 50 litres also go jail,btohqsg
I doubt they will siphon cause abit pointless. Too much work for too little rewards. Higher chance they took the car out for a ride but for spray and scratch work  they shouldn’t even burn that much fuel cause they only need to move the car around the workshop,btohqsg
Jerry can usually 20L one.. And to risk mixing the fuel types also no good,btohqsg
Not all cars pump 95  some 92 or 98,btohqsg
i think i linked up the stealing of bunker with stealing fuel oil,btohqsg
But if you did not record your odo  hard to jump to conclusions. Very high chance may just be ecu recalibrate,btohqsg
MOving car around workshop does make ECUs think it is using a lot more fuel too! Cause it is calculating distance based and for the amount of fuel you use for many short trips.. Mathematically you will see higher fuel to distance use,btohqsg
When you park up the car for a longer time  the range estimate does fall quite a bit when you start up,btohqsg
Goes back up once you start driving for a bit,btohqsg
Also if the car was moved a few times here and there,btohqsg
2.2km worth is a few ml,btohqsg
unless there is another workshop at 2.2km away from the main workshop,btohqsg
Yeah. I didn’t use much of my car over the past week after CNY visitations and I also notice a higher fuel consumption avg when I started again driving today.,btohqsg
And if they would  more than 2 litres,btohqsg
Why would they take so little,btohqsg
Use your fuel gauge needle to judge how much fuel you have I would say,btohqsg
not 2 liters eh. just worth 2.2km worth of fuel oil,btohqsg
Not the range  range changes live based on driving,btohqsg
i din calculate exactly how much fuel,btohqsg
If you've got a 14km/l FC,btohqsg
just find it strange the difference can be so huge,btohqsg
You see your FC when you start car after 1 day,btohqsg
Will be single digit to start with,btohqsg
Slowly will go up to double digit,btohqsg
wahh...i am dreaming that fuel tank will auto fill up when i start up the car,btohqsg
ur ecu will recalculate again de. Sometimes my ecu say range left 490. But as i drive the range left increase back to 500 ish,btohqsg
so far...i din see that happen,btohqsg
That means you don't coast hor,btohqsg
If you coast then will go up,btohqsg
Yah the ECU SUCKS. NEver accurate HAHAH,btohqsg
no one wants to take an elantra for a joy ride right,btohqsg
always give u a higher estimate but it never reaches it,btohqsg
Erm ok if you so paranoid right,btohqsg
I suggest you take picture of your odometer next time,btohqsg
When you drop the car off,btohqsg
not paranoid per se. just wanna understand,btohqsg
