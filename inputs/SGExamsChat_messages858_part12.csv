H2 ? Harder to print ?,btohqsg
Think strange uh the staff say need wait till March when h1 tys listed on stock uh,btohqsg
Does anyone have a pdf of a crash course on O and A level chem,btohqsg
Okay maybe A level chem i still have from like 2019 (not sure if 9729 changed at all since i took it) but i do need for O levels,btohqsg
9729 is still … 9729 no change content wiseThis year’s J1 is taking 9476,btohqsg
Is there any difference content wise with 9476 and 9729?,btohqsg
I wrote in the A level group before,btohqsg
Generally Addition:• 2 topics“Organic Reactions and Mechanisms” (reorganisation of content/approach in a way) and “Polymers”• details on R&C for organic reactions• specificity of enzymes elaborated——Subtraction:• mixing of particles in affecting entropy• relationship between substrate concentration and rate of enzyme-catalysed reaction• how POE is dependent on deltaGnaught——Revision:• context of buffer: from blood to oceans (ocean acidification)• definition of transition element (updated to include Sc),btohqsg
Anyway  syllabus documents are publicly available,btohqsg
Now i need to find a crash course for the whole o level chem syllabus again because its been a decade since i saw anything o level chem,btohqsg
Holy Grail should really saving a copy of the yearly examined syllabus.SEAB keepts deleting them for some reason.,btohqsg
you planning to tutor kids from O-Level syllabus?*,btohqsg
Interview for intern in a tuition centre lmao… nothing is confirmed yet because I gotta go for a content assessment but I cannot for the life of me remember any Chem,btohqsg
I’m pretty sure I can pick it up again given the materials,btohqsg
lol Tuition Centers need interns nowadays lmao?,btohqsg
how much  they planning to pay,btohqsg
is it something like a Homework Support workgroup?,btohqsg
I’d have to find out more from them when I’m down there talking,btohqsg
But atp I just want any intern because I need to intern to graduate,btohqsg
lol. what's your field of work again?,btohqsg
U intern under me. E120 services,btohqsg
Don’t have one  just need to do any,btohqsg
This year 2025 O-Level/A-Level Chemistry syllabujs.,btohqsg
You register under in place first,btohqsg
U submit the self source form,btohqsg
Lanjiao even submit form also wanna be picky,btohqsg
Oh hell nah my gpa would need to double to consider Astar,btohqsg
otherwise ask SiYan looking for lab assistant. lol.,btohqsg
Bro already had enough teaching me quantum mechanics,btohqsg
He probably don’t want any more of me,btohqsg
ahhh  I think well paid intern technically roles  maybe you can try like Micron / Global Foundaries / Jabil?,btohqsg
you got specialization in Laser tech or what ah.,btohqsg
If you do Theoretical Physics specialization idk where you would go  besides Research Center  Uni or Education Spaces.,btohqsg
First batch of students who learnt the new O level Chemistry syllabus (6092) took their exams in 2024 so materials for Sec 3 in 2023 onward would be helpful,btohqsg
my mentee is interning at a sec sch to teach chem,btohqsg
If its not much trouble i would appreciate that,btohqsg
The one where u get sent to schs to teach,btohqsg
yea tip does that but it doesn't have to be under that,btohqsg
I tot it has to be relevant to ur degree,btohqsg
"the school can be quite lax in terms of what's ""relevant""",btohqsg
Technically chem can be related to physics,btohqsg
