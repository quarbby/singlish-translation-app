You can download GIRO from the Maybank website and fill up the Maybank CC details and HSBC EGA. Then you can post it. After few weeks (typically ~ 4 to 7 WKS) you can check with customer service to make sure GIRO is effective. Then you are in auto pilot mode. No need to pay CC bills manually,btohqsg

Actually if paying your various banks' credit Cards through giro from your EGA  you can try using any DBS credit card to pay for all your other banks' credit cards bills so that it is all consolidated in your dbs card. Then just need to giro payment from your EGA to DBS. Save you doing multiple giro forms from all different banks...,btohqsg
Not all cc can be paid with dbs,btohqsg

Axs is not eligible for crmc so you should use heymax choco card.,btohqsg

As far as i rem  there's no enrollment forms for the 3 banks that you mentioned. You just key in your KF number when you do the transfer.,btohqsg

The monitor might not be that soon but the PC is more or less confirmed. Just have to see how this month expenses are first. But would like to get some info beforehand,btohqsg

Need to compare between CRMc+Amaze and Choco card in terms of cost/miles for overseas spending,btohqsg
CRMC + Amaze: 4 mpd  2% markup = 0.5 cpmChoco card: 2 mpd  0.3% markup = 0.15 cpm,btohqsg
Thanks for helping to calculate. üôè,btohqsg
If you want more miles  go for CRMC. If you want cheap mile  go for HeymaxChoco.,btohqsg
Actually you can't really even consider the 0.3% to be a cost because it's impossible to get spot rate,btohqsg
Even without overseas spending  the choco card is useful for getting points for transactions that you normally won‚Äôt get rewards. I just paid donations with it and earned the max miles.,btohqsg
Choco finance + heymax:0% fee (over cc rate) for 2 max miles per dollar => 3.6% benefits (max miles are min 1.8 cpm)CRMC + Amze:2% fee (over cc rate) for 4 mpd => 4% benefits. (1.5 cpm). If you have HSBC EGA 1% cashback for CRMC then you get 5% benefits  else its a toss up between choco card and crmc + amaze,btohqsg
Amaze still has 0.5% instapt rebate ü§ê,btohqsg
I would still go with amaze + 4mpd card overseasChoc card for 2mpd with no issuer markup would be good for monkey mccs when overseas.,btohqsg
does chocolate finance earn miles when u pay for insurance? and what insurance company is covered by it?,btohqsg

Sir we mentioned our opinion many times. Time to make your own decisions. No one can justify 1744 AF but you.,btohqsg
Good qns i need to check. Should be ok I think,btohqsg
I understand that. But doesn't it come off as a waste that rarely need to spend 8k  then don't aim for sign up bonus? Since most 4mpd capped at 1 to 2k and can't split the bill across different cards.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the annual fee u need to consider.,btohqsg
You pretty much exhausted everything. Maybe can look at Amex,btohqsg
That said if you are looking at Amex I recommend u look at something like the krisflyer Amex card for NEW to AMEX before signing up for Amex plat charge,btohqsg
Oh why? Can tell me more please üôè,btohqsg
You get the same offer as an existing or new to Amex customer on the AMEX plat charge card. Of course like granny said  u got to see if the AF justifies.

Hi  if i am just looking to open a uob one acc  and to get  miles cc. With most expenses on  groceries  online shopping and what cc do you reccomend,btohqsg
Lady‚Äôs card is the only miles card that counts towards the $500 spend for UOB one account,btohqsg
so if i were to use any other miles cc asides from the ladys card  there would be no point in using a uob one since i won't meet the criteria?,btohqsg
can clock min 500 on uob lady and the rest on other miles cc,btohqsg
Only spending on lady‚Äôs card count towards the criteria for bonus interest. You can apply and use other cards also  but just make sure you spend 500 on lady‚Äôs card for bonus interest. UNI$ pools for all cards  so no harm applying for a few UOB miles cards.,btohqsg

Hello! For credit cards that includes priority pass lounge access  how do I register for it if I have multiple CC with priority pass?I read that all CC with PP can be linked to 1 email but also read smth like each PP will need a unique email. Not sure which is which. What is the updated priority pass management now?,btohqsg
Nope. They need unique account name. Email can share 1.,btohqsg
Ohh I see  meaning I can register all the priority passes to just 1 email? Will I be given another physical PP card or it will also be shared?,btohqsg
I have 3 diff PP acct to the same email. Physical card pp has been phased out for most cc so no need to worry about that.,btohqsg
Each account name will have a unique member number. You need to keep track of the cards and number of visit remaining.  For iphone  you can add the card into your wallet,btohqsg
Ohh stanchart journey still gave me a physical PP card,btohqsg
Can I just use any one of the cards to access the visits from different CC or it has to be specific?,btohqsg
Add the card into wallet so you can flash the card for them to scan. But do know that it is almost impossible to get waiver for journey card at the second year,btohqsg
It doesnt have to be specific but you need to make sure the card has remaining visit left. You can install the priority pass app  it will display that. Unless you using a card with unlimited lounge access,btohqsg
Anyone got forex comparison between tiger  MooMoo  ib  syfe?,btohqsg
Yep  I do have the priority pass app. But will I see all the lounge remaining visits from diff cards in 1 account? Or since its a diff account name with unique membership number. Every PP account will only display what that credit card offers?,btohqsg
You need different accounts. Need to log in and out to see. Better use something like nelsonCitiPremier  nelsonDBSAlt etc to differentiate.,btohqsg
Sorry I dont understand about making sure the card have remaining visit left. Can I use any one of the PP card issued even though by diff CC to access the the lounge visits offer across all my CCs?,btohqsg
I see  thats a very good idea  thanks for the advice.,btohqsg
On PP  I have 12 visits per year. Can I bring 2 guests plus myself ( 3 visits) at one go.,btohqsg
Your PP is from which credit card? Diff card diff TnC.,btohqsg
I dont know what cards you have except journey man. But most CC are using Priority pass program which is common. Use priority pass app to check which lounge are under this program. Check your tnc,btohqsg
I have journey  altitude and citi premier miles which means I should have 6 visits.,btohqsg
Yap they are under priority pass. After 2nd year  you probably have to take out journey man card,btohqsg
But only journey gave me a physical PP card. Can I use that physical card to access visits given by altitude or premiermiles?,btohqsg
Or i have to use the specific account QR from the app?,btohqsg
Each card has its unqiue membership number. It is not possible,btohqsg
I will use the card in my digital wallet from the phone to show them,btohqsg
You search in chat history. SCB usually dont give free waiver,btohqsg
I see  I didn't know PP card can be added to phone digital walletüòÖ,btohqsg
Whan you log in your account in prority pass app  you can choose to add to wallet.,btohqsg
Even for my altitude cc that didnt give me a physical card?,btohqsg
I didnt get any card. Digital wallet is much more convienant,btohqsg
Oh no. Mean have to pay for one. ü•≤,btohqsg

Hi if my Krisflyer miles earned this month 1000  means it will expire in 3 years  during a month before my 3rd year it will show I will have 1000 miles expiring  how does Krisflyer know I spent the 1000 miles earned 3 years back when my balance at that point is let's say 10 000,btohqsg
Year 1: earned 1k milesYear 3: miles balance 10k  1k expiring  if I spend off 1k and get balance of 9k does it mean I will not have miles expiring? Or it will still show 1k expiring until I spend off all 10k?,btohqsg
Anyone has experience in investing in syfe cash flexi ?,btohqsg
each lot of miles in your krisflyer account is tracked separately. Miles expiring first will be used first.,btohqsg
You can sign up for 2 cc which gives you 1+1. Then you can use both PPs at the same time by utilising 4 visits to bring yourself + 2 companions in.Alternatively  can sign up for BOC VI card that allows all 4 visits to be used all at once. But it's under Premier Lounges  so meaning only SATS lounges in SIN iirc.,btohqsg
This will be a real turn off for those who play musical chair every mth! Even same name different bank transfer also kenna? This doesn't make sense! Their SRF should exclude this!!!

all these safeguards feel like inconveniences until they save you your life‚Äôs savings one day. just count your blessings and don‚Äôt assume it will never happen to you,btohqsg
yeah this is the official message from government....but i feel it actually makes people less vigilant. Now they think they can don't care since onus is on the bank to protect them.,btohqsg
i guess they figured since people aren‚Äôt doing their part  they need stronger measures otherwise they will say the bank dw help them when they kena scammed,btohqsg
Exactly. Plus  moving out 200k should not be as easy as moving 2k. Even just one additional phone call check would be worth the hassle for significantly more security.,btohqsg
they didn't factor in people who legitimately need to move money around frequently and fully aware of the risks involved.,btohqsg

yes that was what i offered to the Anti Fraud officer who called in.. he said not possible...,btohqsg
Oh I pay using AXS Mobile - NTUC Income Insurance,btohqsg
The other recent irritant that tightened is Interest Bearing Balances.Last time  over $120k annual income  nobody bothers.

Happy Saturday all!With the ongoing promotion for the Chocolate Finance Card and Hey Max  I‚Äôd love to get your thoughts on whether my current card setup is optimal for my monthly spending.

Citibank Cashback+ ‚Äì For all other spending (~$1K)I don‚Äôt spend a lot in general  so I‚Äôm wondering if I should stick with these cards  or consider switching any of them to the Chocolate Finance Card. Would it offer better rewards or cashback for my spending pattern?Appreciate any advice! Thanks in advance üôèüèº,btohqsg
it is not supported to pay cc bill.,btohqsg

But only can spend at Japan right? Mean good only if u keep going Japan?,btohqsg
Oh ya  you are absolutely right on this point! The banks don't share their clients info so they won't know you are transferring to yourself!,btohqsg
Hmm you may be right.Bank A won't know Bank B's actual beneficiary (you indeed can put nonsense).BUT Bank B will know Bank A's account name.When you FAST from Bank A to Bank B  Bank B entry will have the account sender's name.So whenever possible  I still try to do first party (same name to same name transfers) to avoid the receiving bank asking questions. However  this doesn't solve the issue at hand which is Bank A blocking the transfer to Bank B! (NO SOLUTION!!!!),btohqsg

Some bankers must have kena whacked during MAS audits. $30k  $120k or $1.2M income  all strictly only allowed 12x monthly income for BTI.,btohqsg
Mas by right don‚Äôt regulate income above $120k.But I think maybe recently too much news of excessive debt so some lame banks decide to tighten even though Mas didn‚Äôt have such rules.,btohqsg
Two different things.1) MAS has no credit limit regulation for unsecured credit facilities for >120k income.2)MAS has BTI regulation that limits unsecured interest bearing balances to 12 months income regardless of income since June 2019.corrected per subsequent discussion,btohqsg

It might be the other way around.,btohqsg
Maybe need lawyer to read the Banking Law lol. Cause if go MAS website and DBS own online FAQ  there is no BTI exemptions for >120k incomers,btohqsg

lol can‚Äôt believe I scanned through 31 pages.,btohqsg
Thank you auntie! So law allows >120k. But sounds like what RS say. Maybe banks choose to be stricter.,btohqsg
Not this one. This is about not paying for 3 months üòäJust search for 120. All the different treatment pertaining $120k or certain level of assets.,btohqsg

Hi friends can I check if im using Kris+ with the Krisflyer UOB CC  do I automatically get uncapped 3mpd at the physical stores? Without needing the $800 spend in SIA üôè,btohqsg
No you still need min $800 at SIA group,btohqsg
Kris+ is 3mpd  don‚Äôt have to fulfill $800 SIA spend.,btohqsg
Hi..anyone can give comments on this Capital One Venture Card?,btohqsg
Yeah it was a little confusing reading the website itself  but thanks for the replies!,btohqsg
As Lin said. However  only Amazon is the exception from this though Amazon fresh is not included.,btohqsg
My understanding of the $800 on SIA group..is the requirement for the extra 3miles earn through ur krisflyer CC from qualifying transactions like dining n online shopping etc. n it's calculated yearly,btohqsg
Should be extra 1.8mpd (accelerated miles).  You get 1.2mpd base  and if the $800 SIA spend is met  then the 1.8mpd comes in around end of membership year.,btohqsg
And you may have to wait up to 14 months for the bonus to come in,btohqsg

Nope tried for 8 days via CS. End up their higher management insists i go make a police report for suspected scam. With the police report then they unlock. Fk up.,btohqsg
What omg then I shouldn‚Äôt have transferred my funds there too,btohqsg
Which means can only transfer out in smaller tranches?,btohqsg
I just put it there for daily interest and pay my bills on the final due date  which means now it‚Äôs not doable anymore,btohqsg
Seems red flags are either large sum or multiple smaller sums in a short period of time,btohqsg
I just put in 100k few days back  gosh üòÖ,btohqsg
I was putting it for daily interest while my other accounts reset then when resetted move them back,btohqsg
Seems likes it affects most accounts even gxs right?,btohqsg
Which means if I want to transfer the 100k out now sure kena block?,btohqsg
Do it one shot if u have decided to siam them. Theirs is block after transfer. Lol,btohqsg
I did one 50k and four 10k. During the fourth transfer kena block,btohqsg
Ooo ok nice I‚Äôll do 100k at my credit card due date cos I need pay it on due date on 13 march,btohqsg
Once unblocked i one shot transfer everything out,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs a good place to put some funds for some interest,btohqsg
Yes. The daily interest is good. Mathematically it means compounded daily,btohqsg
Ya instead of paying the bills immediately I always pay on the due date itself so I have extra interests,btohqsg
Anyone in HR doing payroll?Is it really troublesome to help a staff change his salary crediting bank account from one to another with many steps to follow ?,btohqsg
Dangerous if u get blocked on the day u need to repay the card bill.,btohqsg
Hmm true but when‚Äôs the best time to transfer it out then üò´,btohqsg
Hi all  just checking how long did you guys wait for the choco card?,btohqsg
I would rather play safe and pay bills at least 2 working days earlier. The 2 days interest not worth my blood pressure,btohqsg
if i spent and have transaction posted in Jan but have my refund credited in Feb  will the citi points be offset in Jan‚Äôs or Feb‚Äôs points? i‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôll be offset against my spent in Feb since Jan‚Äôs already calculated but just wanted to be sure. thanks!,btohqsg
Hi I have the same question which I posted earlier but didn't manage to get a clear confirmation.Anyone knows if we will need to pay the Annual Management Fee of 0.03% on top of the expense ratio of 0.05%?,btohqsg
Only one 0.05% p.a. charged by Amundi (based on my limited info). POEMS do not charge anything else. You may check with POEMS what is the 0.03% p.a. about,btohqsg
Hi! My tax payment is currently on giro. Anyone know if I can change giro from bank acct to pay using the chocolate debit card monthly via giro?,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt u just manually monthly use chocolate to pay,btohqsg
just pay using chocolate card via AXS at least 1 week before giro,btohqsg
Just use the card and pay about 1 week before giro deduction date. How do you pay with a debit card via giro?,btohqsg
Oh right. So have to remove the current giro scheme and manually pay monthly?,btohqsg
Nono just pay. ur giro amount will adjust accordingly,btohqsg
No. Keep the GIRO arrangement  else they won't accept your payment.,btohqsg
So just keep the giro arrangement then every month pay the monthly amount using choc debit card before the giro deduction happens? There wouldn‚Äôt be a second deduction from giro?,btohqsg
Yes  pay manually at least 1 week before giro deduction date.Say your income tax bill is 1.2k. You pay 1k with choco card. 200 will be deducted via giro,btohqsg
Is there a way to pay monthly? I thought axs need us to pay all in one shot?,btohqsg
set installment via giro then pay via AXS 1 week before monthly giro deduction,btohqsg
not true that AXS need to pay all in one shot,btohqsg
So eg for Mar & Apr I have outstanding $2k to pay. On IRAS website when I click pay  they tell me to pay the full $2k instead of the $1k amount which is currently deducted monthly. So am I allowed to just pay the $1k amount via axs?Cause I can‚Äôt change the amount to pay on axs application,btohqsg
can put any amount between $5 and 9999.99 to pay on axs app ah,btohqsg
So don‚Äôt pay via IRAS > AXS right? Just pay directly on AXS application?,btohqsg
Hi  can i check jf i link my UOB one credit card for the heymax 3mpd campaign  will i be entitled to the miles? Because this card is a cashback card,btohqsg

I'm not in HR  but when I change bank I dun even need to tell my HR. So dunno how hard izzit for HR.I just need to change my NRIC Paynow to the new bank,btohqsg
Sure but hope it won‚Äôt get stuck  I‚Äôm paying direct from the credit card bank so it‚Äôs immediate payment  just hope Mari wont block me from transferring my funds out tho,btohqsg
Depends. Some only accept direct bank accounts while some accept PayNow NRIC like yours.,btohqsg
Depends on company   some have payroll automated then just on your own update the system by certain date. Straight forward,btohqsg
Cos previously I asked my HR if I can change my salary crediting bank account bcos I sign up for the ocbc 360 ac. The stupid HR just simply Said cannot change just bcos I found a better interest bank AC. She said it's troublesome to keep helping staff change their bank AC.,btohqsg
It's part of their jd right? Why they refuse to do their job,btohqsg
Wah ‚Ä¶ payroll can automate one now.,btohqsg
Just curious  so far what is the frequency you ask them to change the bank crediting salary?,btohqsg
Always can. Depends on whether the company wants to implement.,btohqsg
If one request to do it  the others will follow. HR has a difficult job too. Payroll job is not easy ah.,btohqsg
Mine automated  I go in system change and will take effect following payday. Nothing for HR to do.Even payslips including bonuses and deductions also automated.,btohqsg
I see. Must be a big company.,btohqsg
I've never changed my bank AC before. My HR said other staff has requested to change bank AC and she said it's troublesome process,btohqsg
Which credit card gives 2 samsonite luggages or ipad or dyson hairdryer,btohqsg

This is why I don‚Äôt want to do HR liao. Need to work with pple.,btohqsg
yes  get 3mmpd so long it is visa linked to heymax,btohqsg
Cuz you not the one paying their salary. ü§£,btohqsg
Hard to say la really depends on HR lo.,btohqsg
Tell your HR that staffs only can change once every two years to reduce the paper work. Then u will have a chance to change at least once.,btohqsg
Just update the system then end of month they will make the changes.. like bank account .,btohqsg
Usually big companies no issues . Small companies then maybe the mindset never grow lo,btohqsg
U ask then which account they use lo . Did they maximise the high savings account? üòÇ,btohqsg

Yes but it will earn you max miles. Have a look at what max miles can be used for first.,btohqsg
What abt cash back entitlement? Any card hv such benefit?,btohqsg
The max miles used for redeeming flights and hotel stays right ?Cannot be converted to cash ?,btohqsg
hotel stay? I thought only flight from flyanywhere?,btohqsg
Can redeem to many diff hotel membership programs then redeem to hotel stay(s).,btohqsg
So chocolate finance visa card best ? Since insurance premium not all Visa card can redeem points or miles,btohqsg
