At the start usually slower  could be only 1-2 per day even. After that yea will ramp up  could be 8-10 per day,btohqsg
Can even be 16-20 per day. I saw from Ulu Pandan Vistahttps://t.me/btoapptdates/188,btohqsg
From the tracker channel  i see usually about 2+ months for more units and about 1 month for fewer units,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing! Much clearer now.@berningbrightly&Kris Ohappreciate it!,btohqsg
Those with q number cannot apply next launch?,btohqsg
Cannot. If your Q is out of supply then can apply next launch,btohqsg
HDB now never let u game the system anymore with 2 Q numbers see u want give up which one .,btohqsg
Last time still can  but now no more  too many ppl game the system and many dropouts rate  then whose who wants to get a BTO urgently cannot get,btohqsg
My one withtin q number  but maybe only left lower level,btohqsg
Yours quite high queue number ?,btohqsg
So after receiving the Q number just wait for HDB‚Äôs notification for the selection appointment right?,btohqsg
Thank you. Just wanna make sure cause all the screenshots I saw has ‚ÄúPROCEED‚Äù button but ours don‚Äôt have üòÖ,btohqsg
Wonder  if there someone dropout do I have chance to select nice floor? üò©,btohqsg
wait till selection start and slowly monitor  good luck!,btohqsg
What's the total number of units?,btohqsg
I was almost at the end of supply and managed to get mid level floor (but further from MRT),btohqsg
So I think have to see what you prioritise. You can decide your priorities as the earlier selections happen,btohqsg
Can it be possible get mid level?,btohqsg
Need crystal ball to know xD,btohqsg
Have to see what the earlier selections like,btohqsg
That mean in front q numbers  a lot of them dropout?,btohqsg
It could also be what they choose,btohqsg
True also.. but most of them should be choose high floor right,btohqsg
One need crystal ball to knowü§£,btohqsg
Ok la on the bright side ur number is within supply üôè At least u get to choose something üôè,btohqsg
Depends on individual preference and budget... Last time a friend told me each higher floor bto unit cost $5k more...,btohqsg
Hope so. Ya  thanks for the suggestion üòä,btohqsg
Is it after I get hfe then I can apply for bto?,btohqsg
How can I apply for woodland bto?,btohqsg
Any woodlands or Punggol bto upcoming ?,btohqsg
Usually don‚Äôt worry so much about the level. Many project tail end still have many high floor available  Cause there are many other factors to consider as well likeCorner unitFacing rubbish chuteUnblocked facingSo far for many projects  corner unit is top pickEven low floor corner unit people also pick  rather than taking high floor,btohqsg
Hello u go hdb website can see already,btohqsg
Ya but can‚Äôt apply now right have to wait for applications to open,btohqsg
I still getting hfe takes a month it says,btohqsg
OCTOBER then launch so u wait till OCTOBER,btohqsg
Ok did it mention the date?,btohqsg
Hi Mod  may I clarify if ur data point is before Aug 2023? Cos I understand that non-selection rules were tightened last year.. and my guess it that there are less people dropping out since new rules started after Aug 2023?Thanks!,btohqsg
Can I check why is it the applications not open yet they can know the number of applicants applying ?,btohqsg
Application only opens for a few days every few months  example is June 2024 BTO Exercise.,btohqsg
Its for the june BTO launch  October ones we wouldn‚Äôt know yet,btohqsg
As of 26 jun 2024  Hdb estimate around 20% may drop out,btohqsg
1.7 based on dec 2023 highest application rate sinming btoBut please note that Chinese quota run out at 1.16xIf you are non Chinese  below 1.7 still got chance,btohqsg
You can simply calculate or check it from the stats provided here,btohqsg
Yep my data point was before the new rules. So really may not apply,btohqsg
btw  just putting this information out there for anyone that might be wondering in the future.. this information regarding ethnic quota provided by MND is wrongi just gave HDB a call  the rep mentioned that within supply q numbers could possibly also run out of ethnic quota  because they have <not> taken it into account when generating q positions  even within the supply,btohqsg
U confused about the current BTO results and the next one is it ?Current ones already results out and of course can know the number of applicants applying,btohqsg
Bendon't confuse yourself. If u just want to apply for next launch is October. Once u apply October projects  then during the application u can also see daily the rate of application already.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs chances for 2 time owner,btohqsg
Aim for project with application rate below 1.Many second timer able to choose flat recently cause many projects not enough first timer,btohqsg
Some first timer application rate only 0.1 üòÇüòÇüòÇSecond timer no need luck also can get,btohqsg
