The subj reps just compile list of the iPad kids,btohqsg
tbh my bro using soft copy but he fomo and ask my dad get him an ipad,btohqsg

but my notes are still in my room lol  i miss them too much,btohqsg
Ok la I geog rep so I only need chase aft 7 ppl,btohqsg

No such thing as soft copy,btohqsg
Also cuz less ppl to deal w,btohqsg
i‚Äôm 9 years older than valerie so,btohqsg

Then got another batch but I can't rmb,btohqsg
Are you that tired to give back a proper rebuttal,btohqsg
yea i went bouldering then bowled 12 games,btohqsg
Bro had some bottled up feelings,btohqsg
just imagine the pins are you,btohqsg
You'd wish there were that many of me,btohqsg
does anyone know glow programme for sec schs,btohqsg
more satisfaction in knocking you over,btohqsg
Point is that you wish there were more than one of me,btohqsg
I guess the main reason is you can't get enough of me,btohqsg
idk if i‚Äôm nauseous from the car sickness or what you said,btohqsg
but your words have intensified that feeling,btohqsg
One is my precious senior and one is my precious junior,btohqsg
There is so many TMs here,btohqsg
My dad keep calling me math natural IDK WHY,btohqsg
if im a natural  i wun not understand a qns and i will be scoring As and 100 marks with ease,btohqsg
I did but i got participation only lmao,btohqsg
Idt it's possible to naturally ace A lvl any subject,btohqsg
Can't just smoke Ur way out like O lvl,btohqsg
Yes and idk how i managed an A in math honestly,btohqsg
Like it feels a big jump fr Os,btohqsg
And + somehow i was so motivated and just wanna get 80 and abuv for chem to be ok the leaderboard lmao,btohqsg
Names of top RP scorers right,btohqsg
By some fluke maybe can for GP,btohqsg
So i just grind chem n phy (coz i dw lose my number 1 status) mainly,btohqsg
i wanna be on board too,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt even study GP until the night before but I guess essay if you happen to know the topic well can carry,btohqsg
Thank god for the fossil fuels qn last year,btohqsg
The entire lt was cheering bruh,btohqsg
Like the internal exam the cher list ppl scoring abuv 80m,btohqsg
Uk pam yoong damn fuck up,btohqsg
H1 Chinese4 H2sH3 distinctionH1 gpH1 pw,btohqsg
I think 4 content subj + GP + PW + H1 mt + h3,btohqsg
I told u HOW she didnt give any shit abt my batch,btohqsg
She divoted full attn to the 2020 full blown tampines meridians,btohqsg
Our result release right  she said sth on the pa system that most ppl would hv already known fr juniors,btohqsg
I stepped into class ard 2min late  PA stopped liao  only 1 single statement bruh  and it was‚Ä¶,btohqsg
‚Äò6 perf scorers  20% above 80  40% abuv 75‚Äô,btohqsg
No slides also (she could hv easily zoomed or shit  like what jp even did),btohqsg
When i say tm is the worst turn out merger,btohqsg
Idk if it's cuz new principal or what,btohqsg
No the 2020 batch hv those proper stuff alr and had proper stuff,btohqsg
This is what ej did btw,btohqsg
The principal just went on stage and said numbers,btohqsg
Mine had no names announced also:-(,btohqsg
I already knew that coz that is exactly what she said to the jnrs,btohqsg
Idk abt my sch but the top scorer is displayed on the board in the hall,btohqsg
Actually i heard that some teachers had conflict lmao,btohqsg
I think the 2019 saga appeared on reddit (but i didnt see coz i actually joined reddit q recently lmao  like i mean created my acct recently,btohqsg
I heard fr my jnr and 1 redditter mentioned,btohqsg
Basically abt TM being the worst merger and what happened during results day,btohqsg
But it is impossible to know this when choosing schools in 2018,btohqsg
How the merger gonna turn out,btohqsg
what merger has gone well tho  actually anderson is ok right?,btohqsg
Asr was above tm in my list haha,btohqsg
I heard YI didnt include innova‚Äôs culture (??),btohqsg
oh ye dont see ppp mention jp mich,btohqsg
But i was at tail end of cop,btohqsg
Actually why are all the mergers hving principals fr the off-site,btohqsg
I mean I‚Äôm J1 so idk how the Innova culture was like,btohqsg
Is it only TM‚Ä¶principal + 2/3 vp fr tm,btohqsg
Should have just used Innova campus tho,btohqsg
Idk if it is the main cause due to most of the staff fr tm,btohqsg
Idk how did it even happen tho,btohqsg
Or is it mb coz mjc was the holding sch of the merger  so to be fair  more staff fr tp,btohqsg
This year how many 8/9 distinctions did ej have?,btohqsg
Ej bans students from taking 9,btohqsg
Cuz that's what happened to me,btohqsg
Taking 9 is actually insane tho,btohqsg
I thought I saw on Reddit ppl from ej got 9 before,btohqsg
They told me to chose between geog and chem,btohqsg
Acjc had one 9 distinction this year,btohqsg
Or it's before the current principal,btohqsg
Idk how that guy did it lol,btohqsg
How many perfect scorers tm has this ye,btohqsg
Anyways ej didn't even have alot of 90rp,btohqsg
It is a me problem but every yr this time  it reminds me of bad tm memories,btohqsg
Seems that the GP distinction or AB rate rose in most schs this year,btohqsg
Also I forgot if I sent this,btohqsg
But at least I‚Äôm quite sure from 2025 onwards there will be consistently at least 15% 70rp for your sch,btohqsg
Prolly predict based off prelims or smthüíÄ,btohqsg
I think these were better than mine,btohqsg
Anyways idt ej had any 8 distinctions lol,btohqsg
Why o lvl show but a level they seem not to bother,btohqsg
I'm gonna try ask my Cher for geog but doubt she'll ever disclose LMAOOO,btohqsg
My sec sch got show for my batch,btohqsg
My mum told me moe give the schs the stats (?),btohqsg
Coz not possible for them to prepare in 1 morning,btohqsg
Me too sia but my batch only that 1 liner,btohqsg
For some reason tm is not good at h1 sci,btohqsg
RI did surprisingly well for h2 geog,btohqsg
I guess for ej last year it‚Äôs just that the standard deviation fell since the overall results are still roughly the same. Like fewer ppl with very good results but also fewer with crappy results,btohqsg
My batch out of 61  there were only 3/4 As in prelims,btohqsg
My batch only had 3 8 distinctions ik of,btohqsg
I think Acjc this year had 1 8 distinctions and 1 9 distinctions,btohqsg
But also the ppl who like fail a levels will pull down the results a lot,btohqsg
but to be fair  the h1 classes is 1 arts and 2 fr CMEp hybrid,btohqsg
There‚Äôs always that 1-2% with less than 50rp lol,btohqsg
Idm hearing him yap abt physics and I have no physics bg,btohqsg
And im not trying to talk bad  but people in the 2 CMEp classes  most do not study:-(,btohqsg
Not sure abt that 1 arts class taking H1 phy,btohqsg
The girls generally we all study one,btohqsg
Meanwhile i remembered how i was tied at 1st w a guy fr my class at 78,btohqsg
The lowest ik in ej so far is 55,btohqsg
Then i found a counting error,btohqsg
And i was so eggcited to find mr lim to change the marks,btohqsg
I heard that before  which class is that,btohqsg
Hmm I thought there would be at least one person in all schs who fail like 2H2s then 40rp is gone alr,btohqsg
1 class in S4 i think used that name for ig acct,btohqsg
Probably at most one h2 then,btohqsg
Even my year lowest was like,btohqsg
My class we say create ig ACC but got lazy as shit,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think that hci/ri would have a 100% 3H2+GP pass rate,btohqsg
Meanwhile someone in my class change password and solo use the class acct,btohqsg
Btw u know my class witnessed the mjc trophies being thrown to the bin,btohqsg
Is it like cos of the merger,btohqsg
But uk after merger  tm soccer not dominating liao:-(,btohqsg
I rmb girls got into semi finals,btohqsg
It was the guys that dominated last time,btohqsg
Then idk sth happened to shooting  they medaled!!!,btohqsg
I legit shocked when I heard,btohqsg
Cuz my sec sch had shooting then their PT was known to be like one of the most xiong,btohqsg
JC dun really hv PT for anything actually (even performing arts??),btohqsg
My sec sch band pt is crazy,btohqsg
For uni application does choice sequence matter,btohqsg
+ need go school 7am 2x a week,btohqsg
I suggest u look at 10th and 90th percentile uas and take that into acct ah,btohqsg
But like for the same rp,btohqsg
Do they pick ppl who choose it as first choice than last choice,btohqsg
It depends on whether u are qualified for ur above choices. And if u are at the 10th percentile  they will call u for interview,btohqsg
feel like most of them have a beefier portfolio or smth,btohqsg
I think smu and the smaller uni like sit interviews everyone,btohqsg
When did they start giving this,btohqsg
My batch have no graduation gift sia,btohqsg
my vj friend cant stop talking abt how badly his sch did for last yrs o's,btohqsg
Speaking of which  they gave us mjc mascot key chain before merger then now i cant find it:-(,btohqsg
he call his jc mid tier sia,btohqsg
He alr in jc bro like,btohqsg
How high he want to go,btohqsg
@chemcerwhat tier is bmtc sch 5,btohqsg
aren't all the jc the same,btohqsg
man i rly want buy a proper office chair,btohqsg
my ass barely can tahan my wooden dining table one,btohqsg
Some schs will defo give U btr networking opps than others,btohqsg
It's stupid to try to deny that,btohqsg
apprently. lower cop higher tier jc,btohqsg
Otherwise the opportunities are pretty much the same,btohqsg
wat about portfolio/chances to do stuff outside of the curriculum?,btohqsg
But some prolly more than others also,btohqsg
In 1 week there's like 8-10 U can sign up alr,btohqsg
Honestly it's rly up to u to choose one,btohqsg
maybe less of a discrepency in jc but can definitely feel it in my chapalang sec sch,btohqsg
But like must manage time properly la ukuk,btohqsg
Ig in sec school it makes sense lah so many sec school,btohqsg
2 sec schools can be beside each other and one is good one is rabak,btohqsg
wonder if merging sec schs wld be sensible hmm,btohqsg
But the intake rn is by the same,btohqsg
is intake why jcs are being merged?,btohqsg
I think campus cannot manage 2 sec schools tgt,btohqsg
Some sec schs also kena merged la,btohqsg
Also cos more ppl choosing poly,btohqsg
I feel like we won't see any more JC mergers lah everything is nc alr,btohqsg
still got the stigma tho rip,btohqsg
I think they may js ask the IP schools to have jip,btohqsg
Like instead of DHS go DHS,btohqsg
I think it's pretty much gone alr for younger gen,btohqsg
Even parents now don't mind that much,btohqsg
I mean it depends on parents ah,btohqsg
Like for me I didn't mind going poly,btohqsg
They were my 3rd choice onwards,btohqsg
SP and I think NP both offered AP Chem diploma which I liked so they were my 3rd and 4th choice,btohqsg
cus my mom moved here from china,btohqsg
Ya same but right I rly rly praying hard to get to jc,btohqsg
so more stress on me ig,btohqsg
I literally put TM CJ then poly alrd,btohqsg
If Ur parents don't say this I'll say it ya but,btohqsg
i like die die must go jc lol,btohqsg
They think poly learn more practical stuff,btohqsg
Esp cuz idk what iw yet,btohqsg
Bro u better work hard and go for consults I swear,btohqsg
I mean assuming my results next yr can,btohqsg
I roughly know what course iw alr,btohqsg
I'll do research first  retaking is last resort,btohqsg
Rn I'm tryna keep my mental in check so not gonna mug like mad,btohqsg
Tjc now 3-5 min walking distance,btohqsg
Ok but like don't stress too much,btohqsg
But aft march hols I legit gonna start studying for mye alrd,btohqsg
That's why NS must save money,btohqsg
its the opposite  i still too lax lol,btohqsg
Even if they not happy with Ur o level results rite,btohqsg
June hols try not to go for holiday,btohqsg
They can't kick u out of the house,btohqsg
I alrd tell my parents hard no,btohqsg
its not rly abt them is i personally wan go jc lol,btohqsg
Cause he say he need at least 85rp,btohqsg
Tf what course he want go,btohqsg
U and hui ting study sessions times,btohqsg
Consistent study better than one shot mugging,btohqsg
Maybe the scholarship he want need 85rp,btohqsg
Is the bell curve for math rlly that high,btohqsg
I managed to clutch up for Os lah but results also not what I wanted,btohqsg
oh shit iw go thr lol,btohqsg
My friend calculated A but he got C,btohqsg
Definitely could have been better for me,btohqsg
Rn j2? I got 2 pp from Asrjc in my platoon,btohqsg
I calculated C  I got E,btohqsg
think this year's paper easy  probably that's why,btohqsg
Should always be around 75 what,btohqsg
Nubad lah at first I don't like asr,btohqsg
But now is q chil actly,btohqsg
Either your friend handwriting ugly or he over estimate his method marks,btohqsg
Ya but I wanted to sajc,btohqsg
So that means next year harder ah....,btohqsg
oso y the library look so depressing,btohqsg
imagine they merge jp and yi üíÄ,btohqsg
It's ok lah loving asrjc rn,btohqsg
ASR low-key study hard party hard jc,btohqsg
How is asrjc football team ah,btohqsg
yeah this year will have one qn on black hole mechanics,btohqsg
does the library usually look so depressing like when i went for the open house,btohqsg
My Indian friend joined the football team in 2022,btohqsg
If by depressing U mean everybody studying,btohqsg
idk the lights feel like hospital/office cubical one lol,btohqsg
But the campus as a whole is quite good,btohqsg
but guess u can just go nex,btohqsg
U got chance go back to the new campus,btohqsg
do the classrooms have ac or only a few?,btohqsg
but the heat isn't bad actlly,btohqsg
Like the fans cover the entire room so it's q cooling,btohqsg
if only 1 yr later then i wld be class of 26'?,btohqsg
shld be 1 yr in current 1 yr in new or smth if things dont stall again,btohqsg
Yknow the campus rn is temp rite,btohqsg
Oh wait have U seen the render of the new campus,btohqsg
My fren found it but I cldnt,btohqsg
look like sum luxury condo or smth,btohqsg
cope maybe the finish a ur early,btohqsg
