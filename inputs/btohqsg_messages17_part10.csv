My sister 1st timer husband 3rd timer   she appeal many times with mp n hdb..she only get 35k due to 1st timer.hassle ting,btohqsg
Can la..nt fair ma...1st timer never buy b4 then suddenly must folow husband 2nd or 3rd timer... but she appeal like v long la almost 4 years.. but now get hse already.,btohqsg
i think u are lucky  in the end  your sister still can get 1st timer EHG 35k,btohqsg
given the fact that your sis husband alrdy took the HDB grants before,btohqsg
Ya..they just look at my sister only la.. like pity like that lor.. cos to tink back not fair right.. just bcos ur partner 2nd 3rd timer then the spouse must follow,btohqsg
Somemre she gt 2kids... so at the same time yeah..,btohqsg
But i still tink 35k quite low furthermore shes nt werking only husband werk..,btohqsg
understood  sureactually HDB EHG is for the whole family together—-> Husband + Wife together (family nucleus example without kids)EHG is not really separated into individuals . everyone is group together as a family unit,btohqsg
anyway  good to appeal to get the EHGno harm appealing,btohqsg
hey there  do you usually apply for the HFE letter first before applying bto?,btohqsg
anyone knows the rationale behind why EHG has a 12months work requirement to be eligible?,btohqsg
You can try writing into HDB to ask.,btohqsg
hello all  does anyone know what’s the waiting period from your 1st appointment (choosing unit + otp) to 2nd appointment (1st downpayment)?,btohqsg
Mine was 20 months due to ehg approval issues. But as per otp document it states 9 months.,btohqsg
Wah 20 months that’s super long. Okay thank you!,btohqsg
Can i check for 2nd timer wat grant can we still get? Alrdy hav grant on 1st timer for 2011 bto,btohqsg
certainly no more EHG grant  since u are now 2nd timermost of the grants like proximity grant  stay near parents grant only for 1st timer onlyi think limited grants for 2nd timermight want to check to HDB to double confirm 1st,btohqsg
Is so hard to reach a proper hdb officer… i keep hearing diff ting frm diff ppl 😤,btohqsg
many people are not 100% sure about the grantsbest to check with HDB officials for reliable info,btohqsg
Both 2nd timer? No grants. And you have to pay resale levy. 😂😂😂,btohqsg
And 5% chance for your ballotCan get a unit is the best grant already 😂,btohqsg
hi all  do yguys know if 2 room flexi type 2 can knock the wall to extend the room?,btohqsg
Anything in black is load bearing  cannot knock down,btohqsg
all the walls are black though,btohqsg
correction: anything in THICK black lines is load bearing  cannot knock down,btohqsg
so probably can knock since it is a thin black line,btohqsg
Is the Sales Balance BTO here?Can share link?,btohqsg
if youre asking about a SBF group chat:https://t.me/sghdbsbfIf youre asking if it has launched  no  it will launch together with BTO  seems like its 30 May as Straits Times confirmed that date,btohqsg
If I have a BTO queue number already and haven't chosen an unit yet  can I still ballot for the upcoming sales launch?,btohqsg
Oh I see. Means can have two queue number? Because my current queue number exceeds the total units. I am still waiting for the good news,btohqsg
Roughly how long do I need to wait to know that I can/cant choose an unit?,btohqsg
Depends on the queue number leh,btohqsg
My queue is 1600 out of 1422 total units,btohqsg
Idk lol I don't have a crystal ball. Cannot give you a definitive answer...,btohqsg
U better ballot again . Your Q is not within unit now,btohqsg
Closest estimation you can get is to see how many queue numbers (for your unit type) are called down for selection each day and calculate an estimation of when your selection date might be. But pls note there are caveats to this,btohqsg
Can I ask u guy   if my spouse is still foreigner waiting for pr . I only can apply 2room bto only yea ? Or can apply 3&4,btohqsg
Unfortunately ya. My spouse is LTVP when we apply for a BTO but we have a SC child On the way so we can apply for 4rm flat BTO.,btohqsg
But need a EDD (Estimate delivery date) Doctor letter so can apply for 3rm and above.If u don't have a SC child/PR spouse then your Only choice is a Resale flat or  2rm flexi.If ur spouse is a PR and U are SC  you can apply for 3rm snd above  but u all need pay additional $10K for the flat till another SC is in the application like a child or your spouse become SC one day from PR then this 10K will be return to ur your cpf etc...,btohqsg
I forgot already my application is very long ago . But i already got a Child so i can just apply any BTO type of my own choice because i need my child IC number to apply to form 2 SC in a flat application,btohqsg
Has the may launch open already?,btohqsg
