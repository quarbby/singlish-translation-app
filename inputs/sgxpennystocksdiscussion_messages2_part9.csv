1.17 seems to be good entry. Can consider. Later when being fry up again  don’t chase,btohqsg
If MT reach $2 I cfm sell,btohqsg
Medical counter I cannot take the stress,btohqsg
Bcos I know it's so volatile,btohqsg
MT below 1.2/1.3 is a good buy,btohqsg
Good or not is really up to individual haha,btohqsg
Everybody want a piece of a good stock... Just need to buy at a right price,btohqsg
Like today sure many chase TG la,btohqsg
I can't say good or bad,btohqsg
Is not when u buy  is when u sell!,btohqsg
Covid is new . We don’t know MT will perform post covid. Too much uncertainty,btohqsg
VP hit $1.68 I also will sell,btohqsg
But I won't recommend chasing high,btohqsg
I give the medical vision till dec,btohqsg
Lol I don't like to hindsight haha,btohqsg
Later I say bad tomorrow TG gap up to 3.2 then can't be I said TG good,btohqsg
So there is no similar co with past records to compare,btohqsg
Medical counters got huge profit just sell lor.. So volatile now.. Can anytime get lower,btohqsg
Sars only lasted a while and not any infected . So cannot use this as bench mark,btohqsg
Jerry can you stop prata bo,btohqsg
If u buy at $0.30 will u sell?,btohqsg
But honestly if one value MT at 3 dollars he might not sell wor,btohqsg
I will put the profit to good reits,btohqsg
Why would you sell low if you envision it to be much higher,btohqsg
But these people won't grumble about the price movement also la,btohqsg
But Everyday see money earn less also stress,btohqsg
But I realise singapore stocks hold long term sure don't see money one,btohqsg
Maybe only banks and some blue chips,btohqsg
I see the pennies all rise to their peaks and will slowly drop off one,btohqsg
Medical counters will sell ba.. At least take back yr capital lor.. The rest put to fight yr TP,btohqsg
So don't chase high if possible,btohqsg
Now I buy reits . CapitaLand mall and Fraser,btohqsg
Yup but won't see spectacular returns also,btohqsg
So if buy 30cents MT.. I will cash out my capital first.. Then put the rest of profit to fight for $2 TP,btohqsg
Don't expect 2x 3x 4x profits,btohqsg
Bought 3 weeks . $4k paper gains,btohqsg
4k to Jerry is like 4 dollars,btohqsg
I mean your gains in %,btohqsg
That would paint the pic clearer,btohqsg
If I put in 200k to earn 4k that's like 2%,btohqsg
If can make $5k a mth from stock market I happy,btohqsg
That's why people chase speculative stocks vs your blue chips,btohqsg
The same amount of money put into TG at lows 3 days ago,btohqsg
Erm... $5k per month is a dream liao.. Usually trading end up losing,btohqsg
MT still holding strong ones are those under $1  doesn’t affect them cause not in the red. If chase high  now either panic sold or still holding and worry everyday,btohqsg
My bro Silas say his profits dwindling  that's why he sold off,btohqsg
That’s why mt cannot go up,btohqsg
Up $0.20 in a week. People will sell,btohqsg
That TW guy say is true ma,btohqsg
That's like close to 20% gains,btohqsg
