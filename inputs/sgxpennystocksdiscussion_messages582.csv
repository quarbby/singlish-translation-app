Where does the truth lie? Comparing the accounts of Raeesah Khan and WP chief Pritam SinghIn several areas  Ms Raeesah Khan's account differed from assertions made by WP chief Pritam Singh. Here is a comparison of their accounts  based on what Mr Singh said at a party press conference and what Ms Raeesah told Parliament‚Äôs Committee of Privileges.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://tdy.sg/3on3Y8v@todayonlinesg,btohqsg
Seems like Raeesah has turned rogue and sabotaging everything along her path...,btohqsg
I seriously dun like Ms Raeesah character.‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs just like an employee sabotaging the whole company when the management is trying to do damage control for the company for the lie the employee made but ultimately the company is also wrong in the screening process for hiring the wrong person not fit for the job.,btohqsg
Not good of Ms Raeesah  now she offended both WP and PAP liao... I dun think she will have a future in Singapore... She shld leave an escape route for herself and not shut all the doors,btohqsg
There are bad worms in any organisation... You can still find traces of similar stories if you dig enough. But we can be sure the local media will not give any love to WP...,btohqsg
I actually find it reassuring that WP cannot be less than perfect and will only grow stronger  given the constant stringent scrutiny. The same cannot be said vice versa...,btohqsg
Anyone know what is the Chinese name for Bitcoin?,btohqsg
Fascinating to think that a tiny virus can make the whole human race panic for 2 years and counting,btohqsg

Dont underestimate nature. Many viruses and bacteria in past history have killed more people than covid did.  It's just that our generation (and even our parent's generation) hasnt encountered one til covid.,btohqsg
Spanish flu was one of the worst pandemic . Nv underestimate,btohqsg
Bo bian  earth food are running out so hv to cut down human population  think God sent covid,btohqsg

üíéPika World On the Goüíé‚úàÔ∏èMarket rebound with Positive Sentimentsü™úEquity markets were higher  with the value and defensive stocks guarding the rally. It was a relatively quiet Monday  but like the saying  ‚Äúno news is good news‚Äù. On the frontline is the sign that Omicron symptoms might be less severe than other variants. This gives a sense of relief to investors.Also  China is actively easing its monetary policy to support an economy facing headwinds from a slow down in domestic consumption. In addition  the cut in banks reserve ratio helps boost lending and support the economic expansion.üçéApple: New Love Againüî≠The company had received new coverage from KeyBanc Capital Markets  which initiated a positive outlook on the stock with a price target of $191. Apple has been seen as a haven in times of turmoil for investors looking for addition in the discretionary expenditure segment.Pika World continues to favour Apple exposure.üì∫Nvidia x Arm: The Magic Disappearsüß∞Nvidia seems to have a tough time with its purchase of Arm  which is the largest deal in the semiconductor industry history. The Federal Trade Commission had decided to sue to block the deal  citing concerns on competition and the possibility that one single company will have almost a significant control of the chip designer field.It hurts Softbank and adds woes to its list of companies  such as the Didi delisting issue. With the FTC‚Äôs action  it is almost certain that the deal has fallen through. Given the relative calm performance of Nvidia  it appears that investors had not baked in any optimism of the deal going through.A key argument by FTC is that Arm‚Äôs long history of neutrality would be compromised should it be assumed under the Arm of Nvidia. After all  Arm licenses many intellectual properties to mega tech companies such as Apple  Amazon and Qualcomm.üõªRivian: $130 Target  here we goüèéWedbush analysts  Dan Ives  had a price target for the company at $130  which is remarkably high. It was a bullish call on its prospects on markets such as the SUV and Pickup trucks which lack competition and choices. Moreover  these two categories make up more than 60% of the US passenger vehicles sales.Wedbush had a positive rating on GM  Tesla  and Rivian based on the expectation that future transportation will be of EVs in nature.We hope you enjoy this quick read. Pika World wishes everyone a safe trading week ahead.Cheers Pika Nat,btohqsg
