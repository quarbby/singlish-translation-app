Anyone here booked a flat for bukit merah ridge?,btohqsg
There is a resident TG. Can text me if you are keen on joining  thanks.,btohqsg
Wa means lesser applicants since they have to apply for hfe before they can ballot for a flat,btohqsg
Iâ€™m still a bit confused. Right now I have a HLE that will expire in Aug.Does this new system allow us to manually renew the HFE if we already have an existing queue number + HLE,btohqsg
tldr: this hfe thing only affects those who apply for may bto onwards,btohqsg
but does this hfe thing mean that those who are not working are unable to apply for a flat? since no income = no loan = invalid hfe = cannot apply for flat?or does it just mean that they just need to apply and get a hfe to say that thereâ€™s no loan amount available at the moment  but still can apply for a flat,btohqsg
No income how to apply for flat? Book bto also need valid HLE isn't it.,btohqsg
being a student means youâ€™re automatically under the deferred income scheme  where hdb will only assess your income nearer to key collection  then they will give u ehg and hle if youâ€™re eligible,btohqsg
and most students donâ€™t have a full time income,btohqsg
at least u donâ€™t need a valid hle at the point of application,btohqsg
HDB should have considered this and their HFE will be different accordingly. HFE feels like the eligibility check  HLE(if applicable) and grant check all at once,btohqsg
yea i hope that hdb has considered no income ppl hahah ,btohqsg
just not sure if no income = invalid hfe = cannot apply haha  since it wasnâ€™t mentioned abt this scenario,btohqsg
What are the things to look out for when selecting a BTO unit?,btohqsg
Hmm different projects have different considerations  some may be near highway which causes noise pollution  some may be near the sea or water bodies which may cause mould/higher risk of dengue/ metal furnitures more susceptible to rust.,btohqsg
May need to consider how high you want  any unblocked views  privacy  proximity to rubbish chute etc,btohqsg
I see. Thanks for the insights.,btohqsg
