Impossible to find new that cheap,btohqsg
g29 wheels at 200 the quality also mehhhh,btohqsg

t150 is the ps4 version of tmx,btohqsg
The wheel really small. Reco the t300 if u can save up ah,btohqsg
but i honestly dont suggest g29 ah,btohqsg
cause if u change the wheel,btohqsg
the force feedback can feel its lesser,btohqsg

but when i change the wheel to momo wheel,btohqsg
i feel like the force feedback got lesser ah,btohqsg
