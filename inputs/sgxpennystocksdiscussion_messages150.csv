Just need to take note  chart has to update whenever there is a major change..This one is a guideline  you can use to understand the Support and Resistance levelsTo me I feel Fundamentals and Technicals should work together FA+TAMany times I tried to use fundamentals analysis to come out with a target price for 6-12 month period  to my surprise most of the time it matches the Wave point end (Example W3 Target or Wave 5 Target)Very easy to learn how to read Elliott Wave  I think within 1 week can learn liao..But it will take years to master it.So End of the day  if you're a Value Investor use Fundamentals Analysis to find which company you should invest in  then use Technical Analysis to find your potential entry points and exit points..,btohqsg
while based on my constant analysis and monitoring of covid and situatuon (so far quite zhun by own count) i did not forsee the big drop for MT,btohqsg
was thinking will challenge 1.8 to 2.2 in january feburary 2021 and quite sure which is why i bought and average down a bit,btohqsg
but see your 3.9 call and higher i really too excited,btohqsg
Actually its really because market sibei irrational  and the stupid Pfizer vaccine news,btohqsg
i conservatively will exit at 1.8 to 2,btohqsg
at 2 it is worth 1billion,btohqsg
Moderna month end also reporting their findings,btohqsg
if 4dollarsit is basically 2.4b firm,btohqsg
By the time people really how undervalued medical counters are too late liao  we will be the ones selling to those who chase at end of mega wave 3 and end of mega wave 5,btohqsg
a bit not realistic but can see la few months only,btohqsg
but 1.8 to 2.2 i sure sell,btohqsg
wa i w1 end sell already,btohqsg
maybe pick w2 35% of what i sold,btohqsg
no worrieswhile yet to see where w5 end,btohqsg
Honestly the Vaccine results are pure BS  Pfizer ones I feel it got political and monetary hidden agendas one..,btohqsg
"All these counters I feel are being push down due to one questionable vaccine news  knee jerk reaction from retailers..Pfizer vaccine testing methodology is analogous to stopping the counts  They basically gave 44k vaccines and then the stopping condition basically to analyse the results once >60 people get COVID60 people/44000 people  of course will >90% efficient right. Shouldn't have set ‚Äònumber of covid contracted‚Äô as end point.They never even tell the public among 94 patients who contracted post vaccination is split into which groupImagine if they do the vaccine trial in Singapore  then everyday only 1-2 case then they say ‚Äúvaccine is 99.99% effective‚ÄùThe biggest question is if the vaccine are one step closer to FDA approval shouldnt the CEO do share buyback or at least hold on to his shares instead of selling $5.6mil worth of shares on same day as the vaccine news was release..[WASHINGTON] Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla sold US$5.6 million of his stock in the US pharmaceutical company on the same day it announced promising results for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate  filings showed on Wednesday.According to a disclosure with US market regulator SEC  Mr Bourla sold 132 508 shares at US$41.94 each on Monday.An executive vice-president at the company  Sally Susman  also sold around US$1.8 million in stock  or 43 662 shares.And why did they release the news one day after the Election result and not before?? Was is because the so called ""good news"" will create an impression that Donald Trump has achieved something to help speed up the Covid-19 vaccine development which will result in him getting more votes? If I am not wrong big tech companies and Drug Companies will be in a more favourable position if Joe Biden becomes the new elected president of US..So many loopholes  so many questions ü§î",btohqsg
i think this covid proportion and severity is more severe than we can imagine,btohqsg
what i typing is not because i buy MT,btohqsg
i buy MT as 25% portfolio hedge,btohqsg
Last time when I chart NIO $30/$40 when it was $19 people also say its not realistic...,btohqsg
but because i monitor hor i know for sure how serious it isyou are not alone in calling this MT,btohqsg
he short thinking it should drop,btohqsg
Conservatively can just refer to this first...,btohqsg
have faith this covid is more severe than imagine if we start accounting for 10 day spread and cluster effectactually indian is badly affected US for sure europe up lorry,btohqsg
average ah until no money is around 1.5,btohqsg
so 1.8 to 2.2 i looking sell,btohqsg
but with your chart hor 1.8 i sell,btohqsg
EP 1.50If 1.80 will be +20%If 1.87 will be +24.6%If 2.00 will be +33.3%If 2.20 will be +46%,btohqsg
Provided Wave 3 stick to up 161.8% of red W1..There is also chance of W3 extend to 261.8% or even 300% of W1,btohqsg
i like how furion say this üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Purple Wave 5 is above $4.50 liao (still far),btohqsg
today will see 11k deaths topped out with critical cases increased 1.5k despite heightened deaths,btohqsg
Wa 1 min u can type so long.....,btohqsg
"with this you put figures into perspective and mutliply by 10 daysactually what happens is that ""the curve"" they say is not being flattened",btohqsg
but my faith is until 1.8 to 2.2 i sure sell,btohqsg
i heart ache see so many deaths,btohqsg
I typed that last time  then I just forward..Honestly I am super suspicious and wary of those Vaccine companies  especially those that announced they completed phase 3 test so early..But never give enough test data for us to see.. Even the date Pfizer release their news exactly 1 day after Election results and then CEO and Vice-Prisident both sold a big amount of shares the same day the result release...It makes me very suspicious of them,btohqsg
and frankly i know will have morethese are accounted or overaccounted (some countries as long as penuomia will put as covid death) but the unaccounted and poverty cycle is realthis will die more people,btohqsg
see monday what that young boss talk,btohqsg
Mine Elliott Wave channel is for US counters only üòÖCause SGX already got Master Yuan :),btohqsg
if he give me confidence hor i follow your chart,btohqsg
no confidence after 1.8 i no look back,btohqsg
i tell a lot of times already,btohqsg
if really cannot i change picture to kkj,btohqsg
just to get the point across,btohqsg
and all genies i know is male,btohqsg
as long dont touch w0it is still not considered break,btohqsg
Can send the link to your channel? Thanks,btohqsg
Means not below 2 cent lol,btohqsg
Need more gloves to administer vaccine  huat ah,btohqsg
Revenue almost the same as 19  but cost reduced quite a lot,btohqsg
This won‚Äôt keep price up. Vaccine is one off injection. There won‚Äôt be recurring revenue,btohqsg
Still have 2 quarter for the glove company to adjust for impact,btohqsg
Market look more than 2 quarters ahead,btohqsg
Continue to convince and deny but even Greg tan say medical play over,btohqsg
Dunno see your arghhhh like very painful,btohqsg
Now is 100% upside why never chiong more,btohqsg
The report is actually quite crappy but nobody bother as long share price going up,btohqsg
There are no good reports. Only market making or not lol,btohqsg
Good analysts end up run own funds. The rest follow standard templates,btohqsg
As long as before next result must sell 1st...,btohqsg
I find philips securities give the most crappy report,btohqsg
Damn sian...haha. MT UG JT all down after result...,btohqsg
Thanks bro üëçüèª awesome lesson. üôåüèª,btohqsg
When the master speaks  one sentence summarise all. Power üí™üèª üëèüèªüëèüèª,btohqsg
But from 88c to 2c is how many percent downside?,btohqsg
@MysticDaxGood morning bro  can we send here for the US chart channel?Krispy US channel and Master yuan chart channel are under the same family ( sgx penny stocks discussion),btohqsg
Sell on news that day. Hence the dropped,btohqsg
If this is the case  worst off is Aspen  only come online when demand start going dn.,btohqsg
There is no 100% sure down or up after results. A lot depend on the expectations or surprise elements. JT run up more than 100% before results released  so expectations are high. So many comments immediately after results are 'so' good v uob reports. But do big boys expectations based on uob report?,btohqsg
SgYuan   any charts for ums & citydev?  Tks,btohqsg
Got link to their chat group?,btohqsg
Anyway  BB always play the mentality of the small players to make maximum kills. So they support first 10min of trade after results released  making some small fishes buy on opening. Then they mass dump and the small fishes panic and follow. The BB will have most of the dumping above 10 cts  will the small fishes only start to panic when see below 10 and sell. Probably the BB are gathering the shares in the 8 series again.,btohqsg
What? Why the admin so petty abt different opinion one,btohqsg
No idea. Probably admin saw STA rising that time he topped up more.I thought of buying STA a few times when it was rising... but I din enter,btohqsg
@BankJuliusBaerAssetsjust beware whatever this guy says.I trust Heegul n John calls more than this guy,btohqsg
I am the one who kicked him out of STA support group..I have all the screenshot of his toxic behaviours and messages..Don't just listen to one side of the story..,btohqsg
Woah now come attack BJ wor~,btohqsg
Nonsence. Toxic behavouri? I did not even talk down on STA share price. I was talking about the dividends n etc,btohqsg
Admin take note  this guy likes to sow discord among investors üö®üö®üö®@wayne1919@MysticDax,btohqsg
If u r blinded about how a true Bb will really react. I hope u can open ur eyes sooner,btohqsg
Pathetic. Anyway my analysis is there on STA n STGT. Thai will probably stick with STGT cuz they giving out better dividends than STA.Similar to the note on their inventory value. If the stock is not sold then its not a profit. Yes. The current value of their inventory is high. If they sold it.But how much of their inventory is under STGT again.,btohqsg
So far for those counters that BJ had mentioned moving the way as expected  what‚Äôs wrong,btohqsg
Yea. That group was great but now its dwindling down. I not even discussing like saying UG TP RS better investment choice than STA.Was analysing STA n STGT then suddenly got attacked n asked to be kicked. Even that self declared working with 'Bb' guy,btohqsg
STA group. The one handled by@krispy_chrisi think.,btohqsg
Hi SamAndHam  I removed him as there has been quite a few complaints about Ryan already..,btohqsg
He keep putting other ppl down.. This RyanYou guys ownself observe..,btohqsg
Please ah bring quarrels out of here before all get removed,btohqsg
Haha üëçüèªI was about to ban temporary,btohqsg
Best to not bring your disagreements to another chat. Give each other your hp & trash it out.,btohqsg
I will remove my screenshot shortly  after he go read it. Anyhow post old screenshot for what. Not even related to today items,btohqsg
The Chinese saying ÂíåÊ∞îÁîüË¥¢Ôºåpeace make money,btohqsg
My point is you can share whatever information you want however you don't have to bring other people down  and go around challenge people.. Trying to pick a fight with everyone that you doubt..Bro Joeseph Lim has proved his words can be trusted many times  and he is just sharing information he knows and mentioned to ppl to practice own due diligence..Why you have to go challenge him?Want to believe then believe lor  don't want then don't want lor~,btohqsg
I dont challenge ppl. I raise my points n analysis as per I see.,btohqsg
They were the ones who keep challenge me instead.,btohqsg
Yes price rose to 1.5 as we near Q3. I was happy for everyone who holds to their STA shares,btohqsg
We have eyes to see for ourselves thank you,btohqsg
Did u even look and read at my screenshot?,btohqsg
Gold price goes up can only short term help the stock price. CNMC really need to show result with the deep underground mining with increase revenue/profit,btohqsg
So be nice when I tried to raise a valid point when I sense something amiss. U can continue to trust that guy. Thats ur analysis. But I sensed something amiss already at that point of time.,btohqsg
Ok thank you for your input  I will go practice my own due diligence üôèüèª,btohqsg
I think cnmc result coming out soon,btohqsg
I repeat again. Bring your argument outNext one who mention a word of it instant remove regardless who start first. Period,btohqsg
CNMC was my first and only multibagger,btohqsg
Other than gold  any precious metal can look at (not diamond lah) ?,btohqsg
Don't think so...cnmc hardly move lol,btohqsg
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/9945 deaths with 645k testing and increased of 14k of serious and critical casei mentioned maybe today with 650k testing hit 11k deaths but i guess tenacity of human life is strongbig words to say medical play is over but you are entitled to believe what you want as with my own beliefs in facts,btohqsg
Suspend already nothing to see lol,btohqsg
Hopefully result can push up a bit,btohqsg
the facts and figures are consistently and i mean consistently pointing to an explosion of casesif your leakage is getting bigger but your pail is getting overfilled due to increased flow of wateri do not see how medical play is overadministering and distribution takes lengthy time with the fact that cases yet to find represents a large statistics,btohqsg
but okay la keep talking and sell medicals down =) if can short it,btohqsg

not all in but it is hefty at 25%,btohqsg
like i mentioned after kripsy chris and furion discussion last night,btohqsg
when the facts and figures show that deaths and serious/critical cases uturn,btohqsg
but the very fact is that it is exploding,btohqsg
end of november will see daily 12k deaths,btohqsg
when it dropped to 5k to 6k deaths i was happy actually but then it accelerated and critical cases also,btohqsg
but that is lifewe have yet to account for poverty deaths,btohqsg
To my surprise  India new covid cases has been decreasing ever since September ü§îIs it really dropping or not enough testing done??,btohqsg
End of the day is what evolves more to suit the environmentHumanOr virus,btohqsg
For medical...which counter is a better bet?,btohqsg
Short term  all medical stock is benefiting from Covid. Better bet is to find one that can unlock value in the long term but do be very cautious on medical stock as vaccine news and recovery will cause it stock price to correct in the long term. Funds is rotating out of medical into blue chips with recovery on the road.,btohqsg

Guys in the sj forum  someone mentions jt drops is more due to no dividend.. so once the news is internalize  jt should rally again?,btohqsg
Don't tink ppl would expect div on jt. Cap gain would b better,btohqsg
Hi Yuan can provide ASTI chart? üôè,btohqsg
Must type sgyuan or tag sgyuan else he probably won't read,btohqsg
define internalisei think we need some basic understanding before digesting what is being typed online,btohqsg
in equity column the accumulated losses or conversely known as retained earnings.this is from beginning of time their total earnings/losses till date,btohqsg
in order to pay a dividend it must be out of retained earnings. despite stunning results their AL still stand at 271m,btohqsg
so no div is expected. just someone trying to explain why jiutian price dropas i saidshaman of the pastknow shit but act like know something and make the blur follow blindly,btohqsg
Hmmm  if check NAV per share  they value for money.No vested interest.Just another point of view,btohqsg
SgYuan- Hi SG Yuan can provide ASTI chart  thanks,btohqsg
All trying to rush out vaccine first  scare something goes wrong like what what the movies has been predicting. üòó,btohqsg
It was indicated in the analyst report . Those who have read will know.,btohqsg
The analyst report on 3rd already say no dividends.,btohqsg
Actually don‚Äôt need analyst to tell u earn and earn till this figure zeroed to retained earnings can pay dividends.,btohqsg
Hence some counters they do a capital reduction to zero the AL,btohqsg
Only co with retained earnings can issue dividends,btohqsg
But then this part I think many will not know,btohqsg
Wow.. That‚Äôs mean to buy now and pick up some durian for 1h2021!,btohqsg
So good that the analyst report got point out,btohqsg
So 3Q need make 270m to zero out. Then make 350m make it positive 80m RE and payout 50%Still how much only,btohqsg
Aiyo the world like kena conned by it sia,btohqsg
Maybe next fullYear result will have whining on sj say no div share price drop,btohqsg
Sats no dividends share price up,btohqsg
Then will say mkt is forward looking,btohqsg
Go see how many vaccine they can send. Is a joke,btohqsg
What can I buy on Monday to become super rich by Friday?,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt find the counter on sgx,btohqsg
Toto but odds are very low üòõ,btohqsg
Sometimes the report who wrote the news is also ignorant,btohqsg
Jiutian declared no dividend in an effort to conserve resources for its ongoing operations in case of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment.,btohqsg
I dun win Toto and take the bottle of sleeping pill,btohqsg
There can never be a standard reason for why sp up or down  especially in the short term.Why go and find an excuse to console oneself for the loss incurred.,btohqsg
Did they say no dividends Bec conserve resources? No le. The co can‚Äôt pay dividend Bec of accumulated losses in the balance sheet . Under companies act they cannot pay dividends,btohqsg
The ceo cash out n run road.. laughing all the way to the bank,btohqsg
If you buy ordinary will be 1 is to 13 million  and if buy System 12 will be reduced to 1 is to 13 000+-,btohqsg
Before buying the shares  one should have known the company has rmb300+ in accumulated losses from last Dec. And the company will not be about to pay a dividend over the next 2 years even with bumper profits. So  those who DYODD before buying will never put this into dividend play.,btohqsg
How many will hold 3-4 years for jiutianWillHave a big dip and prolonged so long most will throw and spit on it,btohqsg
They withdraw and say no funding,btohqsg
No need think so far . Hit target price good enough,btohqsg
if the dmf price can sustain shld b ok.,btohqsg
Hi-p make a major losses for a particular year,btohqsg
Ya because of the annoucement t... All medical down... Aiyo.. Now come out pattern,btohqsg
When oil price was high. Sembcorp marine share price highest is $5.40,btohqsg
Oil drop the share price also drop,btohqsg
So Jt fortune hinges on DMF price,btohqsg
The oil price also never up,btohqsg
The co say sustainable demand ..,btohqsg
So will be demand more than supply,btohqsg
The co director never sell of his 50 million plus shares and bought more. I see it as positive .,btohqsg
Bro@furion07really meant it well for u. I‚Äôm serious. U know what happen To SYNAGIe & aspen,btohqsg
It it follows  will mean from less than 3cts to 70cts at best,btohqsg
Anyway have a great weekend . We will know if JT can prove itself . Anyway dmf prices are available on website . We won‚Äôt know the future . I remember I sold aem at a lost of $15000 when they issue a profit warning . Sold at $0.89. If I knw aem can be so ‰∫âÊ∞î„ÄÇI would not have sold it ... IF. Lol,btohqsg
I sold sats  and I didn‚Äôt expect it went up until I saw this,btohqsg
Of course . I am no investment genius. I just Ê≠•Ê≠•‰∏∫Ëê•. Just make sure profits more than losses .,btohqsg
Made a loss still can go up,btohqsg
Sg is just a small island country so cold chain handling is not an issue,btohqsg
Internal transport for poor countries will have more problems,btohqsg
Abit like telsa in the past. Goldman Sachs think they will go down Bcz of loss but Juz went up,btohqsg
Actually hor  I feel aspen is diversifying their business. Their main is property  sideline is gloves.I also worried that the placement will not go through cause the ssh sold shares after news release. Abit scheming.But hor  maybe he will subscribe placement or buy at lower to support.Then the factory already started building. So they are really serious about it.What u all think?,btohqsg
They Juz Get some pieces of cake in glove side n also alleviate the loss in the property side,btohqsg
Yeap. I make good profits from medical this year . So I will not take talk about Medical‚Äôs . If the share price can go up and sustain will be good,btohqsg
Actually  he not director leh. Just SSH. Maybe I wrong?,btohqsg
I lost quite a bit on alita/amal  believing in the ceo great words. So now  I don't really believe in what directors  ceo says especially when the company is struggling,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt mean ssh sold the share price is condemned. Medtec ssh sold went up higher . Aem ceo sold also went up,btohqsg
Wilmar boss bought $20 million worth of Wilmar shares. The price still tank,btohqsg
Ya. He sell cause he know shares going up. No one knows vaccine news come out the other day.If price still go up  no one will blink an eye cause is 2%. He still owns 11%.,btohqsg
aspen gloves factory will make money la. Bec top glove riverstone before covid their companies are profit making,btohqsg
Muz do a background search on ceo background.SYNAGIe boss also cunning. Nvr let shareholders know Alibaba want to buy them since ipo. Chose to announce on the day when they announce unofficial profit. Pek Chek right.,btohqsg
Cause he sold and px go down  make him look bad.,btohqsg
In this case JT aspen price also never rank,btohqsg
I compare Dec 2019 price vs now la,btohqsg
But why he do that knowing it will be going to mainboard. The only reason I can think is that he needs the money to get the placement at .238 and sold at .27 - .28 (the minimum price to go mainboard). He could have sold all his shares immediately upon news release .But this is my guess la. Dyodd,btohqsg
The price he paid for the shares are not Low . Wilmar ever reach $3.20 few months ago. Why he never buy more . So bad investor ? Bec he never buy at lowest . But few months back Wilmar ipo not firm up. Same for JT director / ssh. Why he never buy more when JT is below $0.05 or $0.01? Maybe tat time dmf prices did not reach so high also he also not sure if it is sustainable.,btohqsg
They are just like us. Unable to time market and buy at lowest,btohqsg
They also change investment decisions in accordance to circumstances and co performance and market conditions,btohqsg
We can‚Äôt buy lowest and sell highest. Just need to minimise losses and maximise growth,btohqsg
Yes just need to ignore noises . Those who miss the boat and those who have sold . All this people will be happy if the price tank,btohqsg
I never say buy JT sure right,btohqsg
Yes . But there will be consolidation. Ding dong here and there . And got many noise too,btohqsg
But don‚Äôt have to worry about the tank in share price. I have witness some share price tank. Eg clearbridge . Biolidics . Vicplas . This kind I think will take long to recover,btohqsg
JT still can recover I believe .,btohqsg
Bec they have numbers to prove and dmf share price is readily available,btohqsg
It is our own money. We decide buy or sell. Sgx mkt many shortist.You must ignore the noise. Many people clever to flip prata. Today buy then say how good it is. Overnight tell opposite story when they sold or short.By the way i am longist,btohqsg
Yes very sad . Comrades on same line just hours or days ago suddenly tell u the share u bought price will tank . No good. Will drop,btohqsg
Then I realise no bros and sisters la. Each have their agenda,btohqsg
I observe a trend here. You need to buy top 20 counter. If not  you get stuck because ppl sold and wait at low price again.,btohqsg
A stock needs volume to move,btohqsg
Avarga I not sure ... consolidate super long . Same as alset,btohqsg
Mkt tough must have many shortist,btohqsg
Avarga I buy and cut liao very waste time,btohqsg
Ahahaha....your statements made me recall one person who is very good in roti prata but still got many followers. üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Roti prata makes me see the dark side of humans .,btohqsg
üëç jt more liquid than avarga,btohqsg
JT Executive Director added the shares @0.09  so if u all want  to buy  I think below 9 cents can buy,btohqsg
Read that he is ex-morgan grenfell or some foreign investment bank. Brought in to turn JT around...doing a good job so far üëçSmart fella cos from investment banking - knows the workings of the stockmarket. So  buy the 1m @ 90 to show support for the company.Walk the talk üëç,btohqsg
If he can buy 1m at 90 and there had been 2 married deals at 92 - do you think the price will go below 90 next week?Check out the chart....10 series on the way.,btohqsg
Those stuck price lower will still say go higher la,btohqsg
My Jiutian Superwave pink EWI tried to draw a 5 wave orange Impulse wave within my Super Pink W3..  But after hitting 0.121 it failed to go up further broke down to 0.084Then I try to calculated if My Pink W1 Start at 0.043 and wave 1 end at 0.121  if W2 retrace 50% of Pink W1 = 0.082 (which is 2 pip away from the recent low 0.084) ü§îüò≥,btohqsg
This is my original Pink Wave 2.It went down to about 30% of Pink Wave 1 at 0.076 only,btohqsg
So I'm saying MAYBE my Pink W1 didn't end at 0.090 but instead it ended at 0.121 instead,btohqsg
Yeah cause now it makes more sense liao  if I put Pink W1 End at 0.121 and current price hit 0.0840.082 is actually 50% retracement mark,btohqsg
Yeah so we assume pink W2 retrace 50% to 61.8% of Pink W1 for nowW1 Start 0.043 W1 End 0.121If W2 down 50% of W1 = 0.082If W2 down 61.8% of W1 = 0.073,btohqsg
I will rechart my Jiutian Daily chart (Pink EW)  And then update here later,btohqsg
Since he joined  he has been cleaning up the company - seen in the results.That is why no dividends is declared - which is a good decision üëç cos need to do capital restructuring for the company and he is conserving resources for the long-term financial health of the company.So no dividends does not mean no good especially for a turnaround company.Of course  what helps is also DMF prices has more than doubled since he came in and also the bankruptcy of its competitor.So  all these are good for JT and for the company to take advantage and strengthen their balance sheet and tighten their business operations to grow exponentially  going forward.,btohqsg
Thank you Krispy Chris... with solid FA analysis and TA charting - may all of us  JT holders or JT-to be investors huat.,btohqsg
Looking forward to JT chart üôè,btohqsg
Not vested or sold will wait at $0.07.,btohqsg
I also will buy at 7.... will be a screaming buy üòÅ,btohqsg
At 7  what is the PE?,btohqsg
I will buy more . My avg is $0.074 for this batch,btohqsg
Check UOB analyst report and plug in the numbers....you will know if this stock is cheap or not or has room to move up or down....dyodd,btohqsg
Million-dollar question is  can get at 7 or not? Waits to be seen.... tune in next week. Up to BBs now....fundamentals are there...technicals - show potential upside and downside.I dont have a crystal ball....just have to wait....,btohqsg
Company buyback small small is company money  but director buy is his own money,btohqsg

Well they eat wildlife and got us into this Covid mess but i think the real story is not so simpur also,btohqsg
the mood really is lighter and more relaxed now and virus will take chance to accelerate spread,btohqsg
all this i cannot say la as a chinese in my blood all things can move = edible,btohqsg

just nice the target price for analyst,btohqsg
and JT $9 never say how to arrive at it,btohqsg
delong example you consolidate 1000 shares to 20 shares,btohqsg
If consolidate liddat  then possible la.  But if just using share price movements - impossible la... will take 10 years,btohqsg

yes it consolidated 50 to 1,btohqsg
aiya still to that slogan JT consolidate to 50 to 1 x 2 the price just nice $9,btohqsg
Wait for the major shareholder to privatise cos major shareholder is China government mah....,btohqsg
Oh ya... Jerry says 90 cents.... but nobody say $9 leh....,btohqsg
He has 55million JT shares... probably at way below today's price....,btohqsg
"Ex-morgan grenfell... he is doing the right thing for JT and I tell you the Chinese did not recruit him for nothing.... he will definitely restructure the company and do a ""delong""",btohqsg
which is... 50x share consolidation and if we multiply price by 2 means $9G.E.Mdo your job change slogan#JTno9dollarsnosell#mikethonganksayone,btohqsg

Ya la... just kaypoh calculating other people's riches.... üòÇ,btohqsg

i admit i also admit to owning a very big toilet fund that wash and short market this week,btohqsg
Dun worry... can make back... jia you Bro,btohqsg
"Your consolidation theory very good leh üëç Maybe JT directors pick it up and really do a ""delong""  not lelong but delong",btohqsg
"can go back to alibaba topic and what are everyone views on it if jackman were to ""accidentally"" die?i think this is more probable than JT",btohqsg
see successfully sold you a dream#JTno9dollarsnosell#mikethonganksayone,btohqsg
Wa... this one is conspiracy theory now  Bro... makings of a hollywood movie,btohqsg
now only need mike to be sold the dream and can shout the slogan onceG.E.Mapprove and change slogan#JTno9dollarsnosell#mikethonganksayone,btohqsg
this possible mamike refer it to delong so if use delong then makes sense,btohqsg
Cos of you  Bro and your consolidation theory  I dream of $9 but I never say no $9  no sell,btohqsg
50 share consolidation x 2 the price is just nice $9,btohqsg

Cosco results nothing much to look forward to... My personal view only,btohqsg
smm ah no worries i can tahan and buy the dip i saw got analyst call 10cents plus a bitwill buy to average down,btohqsg
Oil price may still decrease causing the share price to tank another time then when its at the bottom secretly scoop some,btohqsg
üëçüëçüëç let me know when you buy,btohqsg
Why don't buy if it can go to 20cts? I just said 90cts not possible given their current operations.,btohqsg
Ai yoyo  monday 90 cents or 80 cents or whatever  monday will know,btohqsg
Nobody on earth can time it.Just who got the balls to whack lol,btohqsg
Yes...if we know how far a share can go we will be multi millionaires. Look at aem Mt who knows they can be so high . Aem did a share conso. If without the share conso it will be worth more than $10 now. MT touch $1.98. When it was below $0.20 for so long . No body know will reach $1.98,btohqsg

from nationalistic point of view i do not see how singapore going to benefit from it when we already have bi lateral ties with chinathe main parties that rcep wanted to break into is mainly india and us for asiaboth saw the issue and china aggressiveness and backed out.rcep then without the two parties participation was able to be ractified expeditiouslythink with new ractified rcep it presents an even higher barrier to india and us joiningrcep in the end is going to be a lame duck policy (these basically is summarised from some of those geo political analysts),btohqsg

Nothing wrong using their big market to dangle carrot in exchange for higher employment,btohqsg
i last time hear my accounts say india side accounts really vomit blood,btohqsg
They take care of own people. Respect to thatIt‚Äôs not as common as one might think,btohqsg
like jigsaw puzzle and also complain why pappies so silly to allow ceca for entering into india,btohqsg
i old fashioned la but india maths hor,btohqsg

Yongnam already report loss for 3 consecutive yrs  and all latest projects YN gotten were at such low prices  how to survive.,btohqsg
Dumping low price to get projects only.,btohqsg
I'm still holding YN at high level. Soao liao,btohqsg
Yong Nam needs mega projects like Jewel  MBS  Towers etc. Else  without those mega projects  YN had to compete with local smaller scale steel contractors for MRT projects to sustain...,btohqsg
YN already became main contractor for some minor construction works and MRT construction work.. Which profit margin is little  and with so much safety requirements as well as add on Covid safety restriction  workers insufficiency  alot of costs for construction are already in the rising.. But contract pricing signed before Covid has to remain the same.,btohqsg
And with lack of mega projects now in Sg  main contractors will be scrambling to dive price to fight with smaller contractors for smaller scale projects. Cash flow prob now in construction field.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still holding YN from last time.,btohqsg

ü§£ü§£ alset is reverse telsa right someone say,btohqsg
The truth is nobody wants to start any projects during this stupid covid time. Rules and regulations are a taunt.,btohqsg
Exactly.. And with the restriction of workers frm foreign countries  companies can only make use of the current labour's in the market. And this is the time workers are asking for pay rise,btohqsg
And if don't rise  they will jump ship to another contractor.. It is wats happening.,btohqsg
Haha. I dont think you are from this field so dont assume,btohqsg
I am frm this field btw,btohqsg
No transfer letter  no way.Unless finished and wp expiring,btohqsg
