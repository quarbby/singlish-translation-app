What does courier means to customer?,btohqsg
Just sharing my thoughts...I think we accept the job base on different scenario..The job might be $12  but u are just 1 - 2 minutes drive away from pick up  And $12 job I guess the distance to deliver might be less than 6km? Will you wait for the surge? While waiting  the order might be taken by others and you have to look for other order and have to drive further down to pick up other order... end up telling myself I should have pick up... even if the order surge  there's also chance u lose out to other rider or driver...If the order going to MBS or mall that sure kana parking charges  den I make sure the order surge before accepting  otherwise part of it goes to parking  unless there is a free parking which I'm unaware...,btohqsg
Bukit permei to ntu who take who cb,btohqsg
I dun know why I can't screen shoot,btohqsg
Settings  turn on shake screen for screenshot,btohqsg
Do you think the job will pay you 12$ for 1-2 minutes away? It wont.,btohqsg
If 1-2 min away the job is 7-8$ only,btohqsg
Charge and pay is based on the distance,btohqsg
short distance mean pay less and charge customer less too,btohqsg
pay is getting lesser and lesser compared to last time,btohqsg
but all things price hike up but only salary go down,btohqsg
cost of living is not balance eh,btohqsg
If its shop house to shophouse i think the fees is ok.Sometimes get those condo need to park at visitor lot and walk so far just for $9 is crazy,btohqsg
Somtimes those security guard are very rude too,btohqsg
Shake harder later got water how,btohqsg
The heart is your previous customer favourited u,btohqsg
Seriously ill mannered people around everywhere,btohqsg
Take lor. Take liao say additional charges for passenger,btohqsg
U say llm sop cannot take pax,btohqsg
I meant the manner which they make that statement. It‚Äôs not even asking the driver,btohqsg
Somemore asked to drive up carpark,btohqsg
Most likely the aircon big rejected by grab 6 seater,btohqsg
THey really think the amount they pay is very big,btohqsg
It‚Äôs is disgraceful. That‚Äôs how the other service providers are being treated too.,btohqsg
Cfm got some hungry drivers take one,btohqsg
Ya  all theese hungry driver spoil the market,btohqsg
thats why customer feel they are king and queen now,btohqsg
What mean ? How can dropped off under user cancel,btohqsg
Means someone else took the order after you cancel and that‚Äôs the drop off time lmao,btohqsg
Should be not allow ya. We have take item . How come still allow to cancel üò´funny lalamove.some time also we reach collect points then their cancel,btohqsg
For what i know User dont allow to cancel after we pick up and otw for delivery,btohqsg
This is other rider who dropped off for you after you cancel right?,btohqsg
2 order after I pick up and dropp off . Under user cancel,btohqsg
User cant cancel after we pick up,btohqsg
That why . After im dropp off . Foc to customers,btohqsg
If they cancelled after you dropped then you shouoe contact llm,btohqsg
It shouldn‚Äôt happen and impossible will happen after you dropped,btohqsg
If like that then no one will work for Lalamove,btohqsg
The order already canceledShow us the cancellation page  is it CS cancel  customer cancel or driver cancelled?U say u picked up the item and dropped offIts either a bugOrHave a feeling u lending ur account to someone elseThen ur sub rider nv do  cancel the order then say doneAlsoIt can be CS made adjustments  cancelled the order and reassigned to u. There should be same order under completed,btohqsg
anyone have this also? shouldi be worried?yes i got cancel some orders  but i believe not to the point my acc will be at risk?mostly a lot is CS cancel or user cancel,btohqsg
Anyone got this order now? Client when MIA address not accurate. Called didnt picked up also. Take not if this order multiple.,btohqsg
I kena once. Cash order. After buying so many food  last stop asked me topup $150 Singtel Reload at 7-11. When I refused  all vulgarities came out. But I could've spotted the red flag earlier. The customer was using Indonesian number to Whatsapp me.,btohqsg
Becarefull with this van driver..usually do bento food  will paynow but won't untill u chase him..usually at kranji camp or at sixth avenue..I kena twice with two different drivers but doing the same tactic .Just becarefull.,btohqsg
??? he selling food from his van?!,btohqsg
Some company engaged him to deliver alot of different houses ..so he already get the money first mah then he cheat and use lalamove also to deliver cause cheaper so he will gain ..then will nvr get paid after job is done .,btohqsg
Kena at kranji camp last year,btohqsg
Some riders say with prove from last year untill now NEVER GET PAID..even get blocked.,btohqsg
But I threaten with a pic of him n his van then he apologise n transfer me the money,btohqsg
To PREVENT other Driverz NOT in this group. Go Complaint Singapore EXPOSE him so All who use him will Be careful,btohqsg
Haha. I Not boss. We just helping each other,btohqsg
u down there already take photo no use bro if give me  hes van died already,btohqsg
A lot of ppl who book 1.7m van expect door to door loading without adding the helper sia,btohqsg
Any other van drivers here? How u all deal?,btohqsg
anyone have this also? shouldi be worried?yes i got cancel some orders  but i believe not to the point my acc will be at risk?Is there anything that i will be impact? And i got five star rating from customer all the time,btohqsg
I domt know why will get this at risk. Help! I am panic!,btohqsg
By right can't even cancel order right,btohqsg
But then I didn‚Äôt cancel frequently and i have no idea why my service quality has dropped,btohqsg
Even grab also no issue if cancel and their ratimg will refresh every week,btohqsg
What if my service quality at risk? Mean i will get ban?,btohqsg
iirc during training if cancel 1 order also jialat alr  like ask u for clarification etc,btohqsg
Even customer cancel also we kena?,btohqsg
But i didnt frequently cancel leh,btohqsg
Customer cancel no  but we can't even cancel 1,btohqsg
Should i go their ubi office,btohqsg
This is very unfair for rider like this us who provide good service for customer,btohqsg
I have 5 star rating but service quality is at risk,btohqsg
Anyone here get ban before because of low service quality???,btohqsg
Dear Eastside riders !PT letters delivery job. anyone interested?Pls PM me. Thank you.,btohqsg
They don't care abt the 5 star. As long as u cancel few times or more  the rating will drop. Customer cancel sometimes also will. That's llm. So b4 u cancel u consider 1st lor. If u swipe the job then make sure its something u will do,btohqsg
If not  then be prepared for rating drop. That's how it is in llm,btohqsg
They will say  stated already  don't cancel jobsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Then if u want to push it up  u got to do many many many jobs without cancelling even 1 lor,btohqsg
Need to do how many jobs then only can push up to good or excellent service quality ah?,btohqsg
Lala platform cannot make it. Slow respond.,btohqsg
Nowadays a lot of people wana save money  dun want call Grab or taxi,btohqsg
How u guys deal with this  cannot cancel from my side mar later cancel kena ban 30min,btohqsg
If ask them cancel they dun want how,btohqsg
dishonest sial this people   call ask wat item they said very light nia can hand carry dun need trolley üòÖ,btohqsg
To woodland one. For everybody info Pls dun accept this job.,btohqsg
only can ask llm help to cancel,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know need to wait how long only can reach them,btohqsg
Worse is customer expect door to door moving for van and above also,btohqsg
Last time motorbike and car I understand it's part of the service,btohqsg
But now big item they book van also expect driver to move,btohqsg
Van is door to door if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
I thought so too until I checked the booking app,btohqsg
yesterday i had to move a massive tv console by myself i was so pissed,btohqsg
should have called cs to cancel,btohqsg
Only pick up lorry dont need to do door to door loading/unload,btohqsg
i guess then it's down to being worded as driver's assistance,btohqsg
i could barely carry the console yesterday,btohqsg
in the end i contacted llm cs  they say since i completed the order then cant do anything  but next time if cannot be moved alone then contact them to cancel,btohqsg
LLM van order is free labour and sux dumb if got problem that need cs to assist  so before you go down to pickup make sure to check what items to deliver  too heavy  too many ask anyone help if not ask customer/cs to cancel. Don't hope for chances.,btohqsg
Talking about door to door service  LLM stated ASSISTANCE for door to door is it done by driver itself? Is it fare to driver if you will to do it yourself just like our friend (TV console)?,btohqsg
The ASSISTANCE mistaken driver must do it  could it be just help?,btohqsg

Hi everyone  when I see pax want to follow for the delivery I will always not take the job even it‚Äôs highly paid.,btohqsg
how many jobs is that? i tried doing like 6 jobs in 5 hours  but less than $100.. how to gauge if a job is worth the time?,btohqsg
I maximum can get 3++Now lower ready target 50 enough. Bcoz after petrol and cash card you wan pay how much,btohqsg
See the luckNow llm cb price how to getüòÇ,btohqsg
i think i am doing this thing wrong... work like a dog  but not earning enough.,btohqsg
You do more must pay more petrol,btohqsg
exactly... i see the price llm give now.. knn... chui max...,btohqsg
less than $10 per job i dont take... cos petrol is ex,btohqsg
Llm cb price very long alr pa,btohqsg
Their normal car jobs I don't take unless along the way,btohqsg
Do shortly can  you do more pay more whodie.youpetrol using also lugi,btohqsg

Wait for double orders to far away and drop off near hot spots during surge timing. üòÇ,btohqsg
anyone of u use more than 1 phones to stack jobs?,btohqsg
1 phone can only stack 2 jobs right?,btohqsg
Dun try this if you no luck the day you kana ban.bco have GPS follow and sender will see you time how long sending,btohqsg
Now the maximum can take 2 job.but must follow time dun play play,btohqsg
I know here got alot people kana bcoz some time still have people complain here,btohqsg
300+? Now still can get this amt??,btohqsg
95% of the jobs not worth the price. Bikes still can do. Car is cui liao,btohqsg
Then the 5% of good prices  very very very very difficult to win bid 1,btohqsg
"Even the ""surge"" is cui surge nowdays lahüòÇ",btohqsg
Most jobs now don't even give u the correct mileage fee. All is discounted mileage fee,btohqsg
For the amt of time n effort  after minus Petrol etc  it's really not worth it,btohqsg
The commission really too much for this low level app service. Cannot filter properly  cannot give best match  cannot put preferred destination.While driving sometimes have to multi task then pressured by timing also.,btohqsg
Some may take longer distance jobs/multi stop to get more money  but don't forget the maintenance u need for your vehicle as u clock higher mileage,btohqsg
Even multi stop Jobs also don't give correct mileage fee,btohqsg
The pricing is done by llm system,btohqsg
They started offering the discounted prices to attract more vendors/customers,btohqsg
Its like the app written by interns,btohqsg
Long time never get ready üòÇ,btohqsg
Then gradually becomes almost 80% of jobs like that,btohqsg
They won't give a f*** abt the drivers 1 lahüòÇ,btohqsg
They spend money to advertise new driver than to help current,btohqsg
The time to do llm is already over liao lor,btohqsg
But those new drivers don't know only,btohqsg
So they see anytg they also jiak,btohqsg
Give them time in the long run let them see if worth it,btohqsg

Hello guys  on average 10-12hrs a day roughly can fetch how much a day? Any tips from the old bird? Driving.,btohqsg
For sat/sun I would say $200 would be a nice and realistic target for beginners,btohqsg
For weekdays the prices are mostly atrocious so expect around $100 a day,btohqsg
So little for weekdays even 10-12hrs? That‚Äôs quite bad though..,btohqsg
It is really advisable not to work solely as llm driver full time,btohqsg
What recommendation would you have instead?,btohqsg
As I am having a PHV license but unable to drive for them as my car unable to convert to Z10 scheme.,btohqsg
Work only weekends/ph as part time is good,btohqsg
Weekdays what platform would you recommend in this case?,btohqsg
Was really shocked to know that during weekdays can only earn average $100 for 10-12hrs drive..,btohqsg
How much is the commission in LLM?,btohqsg
Nah other platforms either not enough demand or the price lower than llm,btohqsg
Yea might as well work F&B,btohqsg
U wanna chiong 10-12hr with ur car,btohqsg
Was thinking about that  thanks bro!,btohqsg
Imo finding a courier company directly would be better since u have ur own vehicle also instead of using platforms,btohqsg
Since the income would more or less be stable,btohqsg
Some actually offer even lower have tried to search around  some pay like $3/$3.5 for a parcel itself. Mine is not a van is actually a sedan. But is fuel saving..,btohqsg
Because delivering with platforms like llm fp grab is more prone to delays be it sender side or customer side compared to parcel deliveries,btohqsg
$200/day?? Now still so easy to make $200/day with llm meh,btohqsg
Saturday & Sunday  should be able to with 10 hours on the road. üòÖ,btohqsg
Should be able to especially if do both lunch and dinner peak periods and do some stacking,btohqsg
I see on average now jobs less than $20 after com,btohqsg
More than $20 need long distance,btohqsg
Need do 10+ jobs wor of at least $20 after com to get 200 after deduct petrol n all other expenses,btohqsg
The thing is have so many quality jobs bor  n whether u so lucky to win bidüòÇ,btohqsg
Wkend now also not that many jobs liao,btohqsg
Guys  gig jobs really will just keep going down ah the earnings yea   I'm doing parcel delivery for few years already the price per parcel also keep going down forever...,btohqsg

demand and supply yea.. cause now i think recession alot doing gig jobs,btohqsg

In the first place  if sender knows your ETA is 18 mins  he shouldn‚Äôt have waited for you. That just gives him a bullet to claim against you  coz you arrived late  therefore sending of orders late.

If customer says item is more them 40cm asked them to cancel and book for a car instead. But if customer says just a small item and upon arriving its not. U may report to lalamove as item is oversized for motorbike t&c requirements. From there lalamove will cancel and u may claim 50% cancellation of the stated amount of the delivery fees. Some customer always like to try out their luck. ""And will always says i always order bike no problem"" just show the app and asked them to read thru the T&C.Hope this helps.",btohqsg
