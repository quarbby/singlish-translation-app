wonder how those ppl like in mlysia survive...the price of stuff in jb is almost like in sg,btohqsg
During pandemic period just $150/mth since no need to go back office. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Rising cost of food  utilities  transport a growing concern for low-income familieshttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/rising-cost-of-food-utilities-transport-a-growing-concern-for-low-income-families,btohqsg
Poor no need to worry much. Gov will help them with vouchers.,btohqsg
They survived better than us. Sgreans go there to eat restaurants not homecooked food.,btohqsg
Down here we eat cai png better than cook own food. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
What is considered old car? 250k mileage?,btohqsg
My car is going 51 years old. lol,btohqsg
Vintage car. True passion to keep,btohqsg
So I should use 20-50 oil?,btohqsg
My ws still changing 5w-40 for me ðŸ˜³,btohqsg
Use whatever recommended by your manufacturer.,btohqsg
Cai Peng can be cheaper then home cook,btohqsg
One of my regret in life is not able to learn to cook Cai Peng and open a store,btohqsg
Exactly. $3 for one meal. No need to wash  just dispose the packets.,btohqsg
Eat meats will cost more. Easily hit $5 these days.,btohqsg
Yeah man. In many cases even more expensive than singapore. Chicken rice here is like rm18,btohqsg
This is definitely much more expensive than malaysia,btohqsg
Youâ€™re dreaming man. You think rm600 a year is enough?,btohqsg
10â€™years old. Goes by age. Not mileage,btohqsg
I bet taxi drivers will want to be able to pump outside little red dot. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
The rise in gst will offset all the handouts,btohqsg
I think msia hands out are worse than sg lor,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s just populous move to appease sinkies to vote,btohqsg
Sinkies wonâ€™t shake the boat too much.,btohqsg
Yeah in terms of food costs. Very high in Malaysia. Higher than singapore,btohqsg
Malaysian foods actually very expensive now,btohqsg
Really ah. In jb or some kampung place?,btohqsg
Actually maybe they up the prices because sgreans going in liao,btohqsg
Tea garden for instance and many cafes. Common now. Rm5.20. Oriental kopi,btohqsg
Many are now charging this. In singapore you can have it for 90 cents,btohqsg
Even in kulai car away itâ€™s rm5.20,btohqsg
This is not atas place. This is just neighborhood food restaurant,btohqsg
Yes. Just like that type. Toastbox,btohqsg
Toastbox kopi where got 90cents then? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
No more 1RM roti canai alr? ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Everyone is charging high now. Why? Everyone knows online what others are charging. Even hawkers are charging high in Malaysia,btohqsg
In kl bakuteh is rm20 per person,btohqsg
This one can be more. Depending on the food,btohqsg
Malays made canai is a lot better than mamak ones,btohqsg
Iâ€™d say better than singkie versions,btohqsg
Ok. One exception in towns like Kluang you can have cheap coffee there. Rm2 only.,btohqsg
Ok. Kluang is the benchmark then,btohqsg
But then itâ€™s one and half hour from Jb inner,btohqsg
Nobody goes there. Nothing to see,btohqsg
it's cheap but food outside is not exactly very good for body... they use recycled oil to cook the dishes...,btohqsg
Ermmmâ€¦ oily and salty i can understand the concern,btohqsg
I think we cannot use jb as benchmark for whole of msia,btohqsg
Just like we cannot compare cbd and neighbourhood food cost,btohqsg
want cheap u must drive at least 30 km away from custom... the price near custom is catered for sinkies,btohqsg
