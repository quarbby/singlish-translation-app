My emath B3 only 43 percentile wtf,btohqsg
the year i graduated two of the sec 3s were filmed doing bad things in the toilet,btohqsg
we didnt have percentiles in sec sch,btohqsg
Lmao i constantly failed amath amd got A2 for Os,btohqsg
the only way u knew ur percentile is if u kenna called on stage,btohqsg
I don’t think I can for pure chemistry,btohqsg
and ppl tell u ur 1st 2nd or 3rd,btohqsg
If you suck at math  there are people that suck worse than you,btohqsg
I rmb jc during our time they removed level position,btohqsg
But i knew my level position during j2 prelims,btohqsg
Ah  those are good things then,btohqsg
and then my friend sent the video to the principap,btohqsg
But in all  fk jc tbh,btohqsg
Class and level position made things more toxic tbh,btohqsg
They also stopped releasing percentiles for my sch,btohqsg
Its the easy route to some uni courses,btohqsg
jc prelims was btr than actual avlsl,btohqsg
Probably an across the board move,btohqsg
Idk eh i found a lvls harder but more fun,btohqsg
Good thing is that only my primary school and half of my secondary school life had this,btohqsg
Only subject that was a fkin joke was chem,btohqsg
I’m 80+ percentile... in the worst jc in sg,btohqsg
U are equivalent to the 30th percentile in RI,btohqsg
Lets just say thos was the only jc i stood a chance of getting into,btohqsg
they dont give us a total percentile,btohqsg
Was everyone smart af or sth,btohqsg
Its not abt smarts or what,btohqsg
Percentile is as good as level position tbh,btohqsg
Back then i can game all day,btohqsg
y the discord become computer sci channel ah,btohqsg
And of course  knowing how to use it appropriately,btohqsg
If positioning is toxic  why r we endorsing percentiles,btohqsg
Just spam papers a month before the exams,btohqsg
u can try for A levels  goodluck,btohqsg
I know i’m screwed if i did,btohqsg
I intend to do prelim papers for every subject from every 15+ point jc before As,btohqsg
have to see how smart the person in question is,btohqsg
well  u cant use it if u dont have any knoweldge of amath  like me,btohqsg
if they can absorb info like mad,btohqsg
I’d do the elite sch ones,btohqsg
elite sch papers not necessarily the best,btohqsg
nah our papers are generally more difficult than actual A levels,btohqsg
i got teach elite students who struggle at JJC prelim papers,btohqsg
My school chem prelims too easy,btohqsg
is it true that elite jcs hv one set of answers for internal circulation,btohqsg
You’d be abit not smart if you judge the quality of Teachers based on academic achievements of students in the school,btohqsg
bio just burn and memorise the RJ H2 Bio summary,btohqsg
The hard ones are not from the supposed elite ones,btohqsg
Do NYJC paper for Maths  FM  Chem,btohqsg
the guy who sets these papers,btohqsg
