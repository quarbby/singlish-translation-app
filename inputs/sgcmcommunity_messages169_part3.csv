With that kind of budget might as well buy new car  no need to deal with 2nd hand issues,btohqsg

Every time I see premium car price at this high COE make me think my BTO like cheap,btohqsg

Camry very nice  but unfortunately the sales keep going down cause people prefer SUV body than sedan body,btohqsg
SUV also cause tall so can see infront clearer than sedan hahaI always sceptical when turning when driving My mazda 3,btohqsg
Modern SUV still can flip when turning? I see on the road vezel turn damn fast one,btohqsg
Sienta the design is like super subjective sia,btohqsg
Some love it some hate it,btohqsg

Drive conti car don't think of FC,btohqsg
Why though? Isit cause by default most of them are fuel monsters? or,btohqsg
I was told that German manufacturer don't prioritise FC like the Japanese manufacturers. Germans priorities comfort  power and luxury over FC and reliability that the Japanese put above all else,btohqsg
But not all manufacturers like that la  abit stereotype,btohqsg
Your budget can get rs6 left 3 years,btohqsg
lol this is not true... The new VW engines can go 25+km/l on highways...,btohqsg
Ofc la who would nt worry abt that,btohqsg
I think itâ€™s you whoâ€™s trolling,btohqsg
thats why they going into EV now due to EU climate change regulations,btohqsg
but i think in the race to EV dominance  chinese/jap brands will be faster than conti la,btohqsg
Toyota like slow when it come to EV  maybe Chinese brand will be the 1st,btohqsg
In china the adoption rate for EV very higg,btohqsg
"probably because EV cars are ""easier"" to maintain  though infra reliance is a big negative. but since China is China  infra can be easily built (or faked lol)",btohqsg
Hi sir can I try SUV parf for min. 4 yrs and $80k or under? ðŸ¥º,btohqsg
Can check what other brands and models ? ðŸ¥º,btohqsg
Eh forgot to change account ah,btohqsg
I always think vezel is good first cross over SUV  so can consider that. If not can see Toyota chr or Mazda crossover SUV also.,btohqsg
But all those are smaller SUV,btohqsg

Currently driving a stinger with 8 years 8 months left.,btohqsg
Are you going to buy a new car after selling off your stinger?,btohqsg
Suddenly so many rich people here want to buy car,btohqsg
Iâ€™m open to options  new or secondhand with about the same lifespan as my current :),btohqsg
Ppl who donâ€™t drive are the richest ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Still got 8 yrs and 8 months left   can drive for another 2 yrs plus then sell,btohqsg
I think car sell before 5 yrs   will be better,btohqsg
