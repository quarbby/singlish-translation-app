This suckBut I might still keep it because they got free airport lounge and I do not have a general spending card,btohqsg
"That card used to be my ""go to"" I think I am switching to maybank family and friend card.",btohqsg
Before anything  check your MAB for Jun first. Once you check and confirm you're eligible  then register and deposit in Sep. To be safe  latest by 27 Sep. Just remember how OCBC digital services went down today 🤪Answering:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/229744,btohqsg
This additional clause on fresh funds definition is going to cause some headache. It's not clear what withdrawels mean. Worst case it can include giro deductions.,btohqsg
Also  it is register at website only. No more SMS registration.https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.html,btohqsg
anyone have issue login to citi online from computer?,btohqsg
Ok. Haven't been reading the tnc details for some months. Any idea if it's enforced?,btohqsg
Is there any category to choose from for UOB lady's if I want to buy phone from Oppo/Singtel shop?,btohqsg
if can buy vouchers e.g. Amazon  lazada from heymax can choose the fashion category.,btohqsg
Register first and once receive acknowledgment  deposit fresh fund above the June balance.,btohqsg
With exclusion of Amaze  does it mean cannot pair Amaze + UOB lady’s card to pay overseas hotel (Fcy) to earn 4mpd?  Any alternative to reduce or eliminate foreign transaction fees?,btohqsg
No other card can replace amaze currently.Just go down the ranking order of your existing cards striking out all amaze + Uob cards combo.,btohqsg
Basically it just means the Uob cards u used to pair with amaze are now 4% - 2.5% = 1.5% lousier.Sad yes but not doomsday.Uob lady 5/6mpd still very viable naked overseas.,btohqsg
Yes I'm still using my UOB lady. Just amaze will see more failed transactions 😂,btohqsg
Alternative is to buy it before 27 Sep.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  would greatly appreciate some clarity on UOB$ merchant spends.For UOB One and UOB Evol credit cards  I recognize that spends at UOB$ merchants are not eligible for cashback (save for Dairy Farm group). However  do spends at UOB$ merchants nevertheless count towards the minimum spend requirements do these cards?The UOB CSOs were inconsistent in their responses to above question and unable to point to relevant clause in T&Cs to substantiate their responses.Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Who told you that uob$ merchants cannot contribute or earn cashback for Uob one cards?,btohqsg
I would phrase it as suchUob one cards are immune to uob$ issues that miles card face.Uob miles cards that award miles based on the unaggregated spend entry will not earn miles at uob$ merchants,btohqsg
Did you mean UOB$ awarded transactions? If you're not awarded  you are eligible for the card's own cashback  if you're awarded  it's still counted as spending.,btohqsg
Potentially silly question so I hope you’ll bear with me.Do you withdraw out the $2.30 daily earned interest in Chocolate Finance @$20k?,btohqsg
Hi ! I would like to confirm if we get to earn points/cashback if we use credit card to top up grab? Thank u in advance!!,btohqsg
Min $5 spend at 6 different Kris+ merchants to earn 500 Krisflyer miles. 500/$30 = at least16mpd.Double dip with 4mpd card  easily20mpd.😆,btohqsg
UOB CSO told me so. Now I know they are incorrect.  Thanks so much for sharing.,btohqsg
Nothing new that they're wrong 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Just a question even though it's out of topic. But does anyone here know any website that pay you to watch ads,btohqsg
Hi all  any idea how long it takes to reflect hsbc live+ rewards point for your spendings?,btohqsg
btw not really rewards points  it is cashback,btohqsg
Yes. If u keep the 2.3  they will consider this to be above 20k and invest the amount which will go into negative investment sometimes,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Userkchas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no sharing of personal referral codes,btohqsg
2nd Sep 9am already: Those doing EGA event can start sending in sms and doing the transfers👍,btohqsg
Hi i just checked the statement and realized there is a annual fee charge for SCB bonus saver debit card?Is it possible to ask to waive?,btohqsg
Looks like phishing link  maybe check who is the sender,btohqsg
There is app and SMS notification as well 😅. And it ask me to do an app reset,btohqsg
But I just performed a inward transfer on Saturday 😐,btohqsg
This is most likely legit based on what u shared. To confirm  check the email headers to see the origin of the email. If u are not sure how to check or can't confirm  do not click on links presented in the email or open attachments attached (if any),btohqsg
Right now only UOB absolute cashback gives rewards for grab top up (0.3%),btohqsg
I got the email  app and sms notification too.,btohqsg
U this kind of message quite dangerous.Better give more context when u msg like this. Otherwise might get reported since this word is often associated with naughty activities,btohqsg
Hi  any recommendation on the best home insurance?,btohqsg
I just called the CS again and apparently it was just UOB sending the cards to 'specific' customers.. such an honour to receive a practically useless card 😂,btohqsg

Hi all  if I apply to open EGA account today  2nd Sep.Will I be able to join in for this month(Sep) promotion?,btohqsg
I suppose this sms will do. From what I know  there were some who didnt receive the other sms after some long time.HSBCSG: Thank you for your interest in the September EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. We acknowledge your registration based on xxxxxxxx that you have keyed in earlier. If incorrect  please resubmit your entry.

Did you participate in Aug? If no  then it's ok.,btohqsg
Hi guys  could I check if the bank balance in a normal uob bank account is also considered for the uob nation of savers please? I am not sure if that is considered as uniplus savings account,btohqsg
