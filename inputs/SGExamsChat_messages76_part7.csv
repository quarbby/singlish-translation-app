im so bored at this rate i am turning asexual,btohqsg
Poly is easier to enter uni and do quite well overall coz of portfolio experience for certain courses,btohqsg
Keep the chat PG13 if you wish to remain here,btohqsg
Honestly Lang Studies JC route is better  not much Lang courses in Poly. The closest I can think of is Creative Writing.,btohqsg
If you're very convinced  then go ahead with your plan.,btohqsg
Still can't forget the House MD episode on that,btohqsg
itâ€™s not ok to be asexual?,btohqsg
Imagine doing physics for 4 years as a bio student,btohqsg
No  she said she did the UK A level over June Hols lol,btohqsg
Stop asking questions you know you arenâ€™t going get responses to,btohqsg
I don't see the + point for JC if you're very set on a few courses,btohqsg
at least i know whos lgbt now,btohqsg
lmao the thing is in JC i can take a combi such as CLL translation Econs and h1 math/chem,btohqsg
and it's faster by 1 year,btohqsg
Maybe the dude/dudette doesn't know if there would be responses,btohqsg
At least it's better than econs,btohqsg
was gonna ask why then i realised its nursing,btohqsg
Do you even like Math or Chem?,btohqsg
she probably doesnt have a choice,btohqsg
go into nursing without passion then for wat?,btohqsg
but in the case that i dun get A2 for el,btohqsg
I don't see what's the use of H1 Chem or Math  if you have O-level Math or Chem,btohqsg
i'll be forced to take hybrid,btohqsg
ill replace h2 translation with chem,btohqsg
@chemcerI think it's good you didn't eat the mookata yesterday,btohqsg
any combination other than pcme and bcme are considered weird combination to me,btohqsg
anw i am 17 bi  if anyone wants to speak about lgbtq+ issues just slide into my dm  really into mental health awareness  so cheers ðŸ˜‚ (not PG13),btohqsg
Need b3 for hcl to take i think,btohqsg
and yes offence to art sstream ppl,btohqsg
It's for ppl to flex their bilingualism,btohqsg
Honestly I don't see the value of A-level chem. The electronic transitions  slightly better atomic/chemical model  etc.,btohqsg
That's not going to be relevant in Chinese Studies,btohqsg
i want to be bilingual uwu,btohqsg
i alr met the requirements for CLL,btohqsg
im a bilingual too no one offered me that D:,btohqsg
i need an A2 for EL now,btohqsg
Nothing academic is ever relevant to real life,btohqsg
Last warning  this is not a dating website,btohqsg
U aren't bilingual enough it seems,btohqsg
When did you come to my house,btohqsg
No  there are different levels of relevance,btohqsg
not dating  but just mental health awareness  thank u sir,btohqsg
"I'm not just saying ""hur dur you took latin so useless""The question is ON TOP OF O-LEVELS PURE CHEM  what does H1 Chem provide?",btohqsg
Bio Extension Topic  looks at whatâ€™s happening in the world now,btohqsg
Anyone who score A for EL and CL are pro linguists lol,btohqsg
wbu? not just for gays but also straight pple.,btohqsg
It's just a general feeling of stomach kot feeling well,btohqsg
oh i was offered chinese lit,btohqsg
i know someone who scored A2 dor both languages,btohqsg
Your physics is bio oriented so still ok,btohqsg
