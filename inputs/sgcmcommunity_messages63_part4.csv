Don't take it. Ask them to make good before you take over. Otherwise go to CASE... claim lemon law. 6 months warranty. Can be quite expensive yo rectify the leak. May be leaking from engine oil seal. Have to remove gearbox and engine to replace the seal. Time wasting too,btohqsg
Leak from valve is need for top overhaul,btohqsg
Piston ring problem already  need major overhaul,btohqsg
The dealer say need to pay deposit before taking for inspection ah?,btohqsg
Usually is 6 months warranty for engine and gearbox... some may do for you out of goodwill buy have to cross fingers ar...,btohqsg

They wash their hands off of it,btohqsg
This is why Pre Purchase Inspections are important,btohqsg
This one I knew... hahas... lemon law is 6 months for only engine and gearbox gg only...,btohqsg
Sometimes also hard to say got wear and tear... when you test drive the car  all is good and no issues... After took car maybe 2 days later then problems come one and after...,btohqsg
