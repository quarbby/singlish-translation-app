Honestly not a bad idea. We donâ€™t really need cars in sg,btohqsg
i like the idea we drive our nice car over  then play with the track car there.  So anything happens to it  not as painful,btohqsg
but if its an offroad car  you need to tow,btohqsg
They donâ€™t have very strict rules on inspection I think,btohqsg
Yes can. But u cannot drive it to sg,btohqsg
so the solution is to find a malaysia girl lol,btohqsg
My friend gets his Malaysian relatives,btohqsg
To drive the car into sg,btohqsg
Just donâ€™t suay get stopped to check license ðŸ˜…,btohqsg

its a good budget solution to have a track car,btohqsg

Put spacer someone say inspection fail,btohqsg
Spacer when u go fast I feel weird. Or maybe just my car,btohqsg
