For DBS altitude Visa card  I googled about the mile expiry and it says the miles has no expiry. Can I confirm if the miles expire as the card expires?,btohqsg
The miles dont expire. Before the card expire  DBS will mail you a new Altitude card with new expiry date,btohqsg
Noted thank you! Can I also ask how much cashback I can get if I donâ€™t use them to redeem miles?,btohqsg
Hi! can i ask is it free to transfer my US shares from tiger brokers to webull? and how do I do it?,btohqsg
very little cashback  its never worth it. usually the strategy is to get the DBS WWMC card (worlds women mastercard) to clock online spending for 4mpd. $2k/mth or 8k miles per month limit. the points pool with DBS Altitude which used to be a great card for booking SQ flights 3mpd  expedia sometimes 6mpd... but now it has been nerfed,btohqsg
Iâ€™m planning to book tickets on Expedia  I saw the price is kinda the same from other websites and I can get 6mpd with DBS altitude cardðŸ˜‚ so I want to figure out if it is worth it since I seldom use this card and it will take a long time for me to redeem the miles in this cardâ€¦ but I will keep this card for the free lounge passes as long as the annual fee is waivedðŸ¤£,btohqsg
u can use it as a general spend card. for amounts less than $5,btohqsg
I usually use amaze + Citi rewards,btohqsg
