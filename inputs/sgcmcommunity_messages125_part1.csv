Hi hi can anyone give recommendations on what to do if you can’t see your side mirror when it’s raining heavily? I can’t really see much on side mirror and mirror and I was planning to do tinting as well,btohqsg
Any shops to recommend as well?,btohqsg
Buy those film stickers off of Lazada/shopee that will prevent water from staying on,btohqsg
I think I have one on my side mirror but not really working,btohqsg
And then should I do my tinting before or after pasting haha,btohqsg
U tint side mirror de meh?,btohqsg
Just tint first cus sg hot weather,btohqsg
Better to splurge if you can!,btohqsg
Prevent those nasty UV rays from your skin,btohqsg
I first thing I do when get car is tint,btohqsg
My first car i mistake i didnt tint,btohqsg
Your window tint doesn't affect the mirror though?,btohqsg
Cause the mirror also need to put the anti rain thingy if not can’t see also,btohqsg
Then the same mirror need to do tinting also haha,btohqsg
Yes that is separate from your tints,btohqsg
Why would you tint your ORVMs,btohqsg
I mean the side window haha,btohqsg
Yes side window you won't be pasting the anti rain thing,btohqsg
Can we just call it side mirror,btohqsg
Cause sometimes also hard to look at the side mirror from the side window. And sometimes it fogs out as well,btohqsg
And also lower the window slightly,btohqsg
That means on window tint must cut one hole at the side mirror position,btohqsg
That one tint too dark already hahahha,btohqsg
Use hydrophobic coating on it so the water beads and flows away smoothly,btohqsg
