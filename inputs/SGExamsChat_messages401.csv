Eh some profs never even change their exam paper year by year lol,btohqsg
omg i saw someone i know have to resit the paper,btohqsg
isnt nursing -> med easier than bcme -> med,btohqsg
assuming gpa 4.0 and 90rp respectively,btohqsg
but gpa 4.0 harder than 90rp i think,btohqsg
cos a lot of grp work,btohqsg
i wld say for me   getting 4.0 gpa is damn hard considering you have to maintain your score for like solid 3 years,btohqsg
like jc yk if you suck at one exam its fine but ur poly u suck one exam  gg can drop alr,btohqsg
is math must to go Med,btohqsg
Yea it‚Äôs not easy. In uni my friends said like if you got 4.9/5 you damn smart  5/5 means lucky,btohqsg
there‚Äôs a little truth to it,btohqsg
is there really a point in going beyond 4.5 anyway? Because you still graduate with the same class honours,btohqsg
mainly if you want to do further studies,btohqsg
if i email a company for a job how long will they usually take to reply,btohqsg
Do 90rp students tend to get 4plus goa,btohqsg
depends on the company lol. i've gotten anything from a day to never reply,btohqsg
also 16 yr old can volunteer for most things right...?,btohqsg
i would say usually yes  because it kinda shows they alr know how to study,btohqsg
but i've seen some crash and burn,btohqsg
uni just a different ball game la,btohqsg
Hi this is a weird question  but i had a family member lose data on his laptop and now apparrntly to get it back he has to pay a $100. Its a scam right,btohqsg
If he didnt go to the manufacturer company,btohqsg
depends honestly some can be recovered,btohqsg
not sure but $100 seems rather steep for such a thing doesnt it?,btohqsg
they wanted the money through paypal i think,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt give in cuz they might not even rt the data bck to the person.,btohqsg
Ok thks i searched for these scams online but cant seem to find one like this so i asked,btohqsg
it's hard to tell whether it's a scam without all the context,btohqsg
some data recovery can be quite ex  but it's never a guaranteed recovery,btohqsg
for more serious ones  a few hundred is not out of the question  but the sus part is specifically wanting it through paypal,btohqsg
but I don't personally know him LOL,btohqsg
How do you find his ig acc,btohqsg
i‚Äôd be shocked if he wasnt‚Ä¶,btohqsg
How does having 220 comments link to being,btohqsg
ppl with crap ton of followers and social media attention usually a bit uh,btohqsg
either super nice or super problematic,btohqsg
nowadays all xmm xdd have some 200 comments in their comment section,btohqsg
how come sudd got following and whatnot,btohqsg
yahor why i keep seeing ah,btohqsg
ppl be having time for drama meanwhile the only drama i have is with the idiot who invented this crap called calculus,btohqsg
How tf does he have so many followers,btohqsg

but i agree with her now,btohqsg
ask her go volunteer at lizard sheltere,btohqsg
I'd argue using PayPal isn't any less safe,btohqsg
In fact PayPal's almost always less safe for seller,btohqsg
it's just an odd choice to be very specific about,btohqsg
if they let u use other platforms it'd be safer,btohqsg
a lot of people in SG don't even have paypal,btohqsg
WHY ARE U ALWAYS EXPOSING ME,btohqsg

I can't take milk  and gude,btohqsg
this is out of my control,btohqsg
but oat milk should be can then no?,btohqsg
eat as much lactose as you can kids,btohqsg
you generally get more lactose intolerant as you age,btohqsg
you know humans were lactose intolerant,btohqsg
so we have the abnormal gene mustation thats lets us drnk milk,btohqsg
my best friend went from loving dairy to not being able to take a bite of cheese without puking,btohqsg
it doesn't work for her anymore,btohqsg
ouhh no how you gonna get calcium and proteib,btohqsg
quite a few non dairy foods have high calcium,btohqsg
yeah your cat has so much protein,btohqsg
I lost weight from taking a meal replacement. The meal replacement has lactase enzyme in it.Suddenly can drink more milk again,btohqsg
My family member ‚Äòs flight got cancelled last minute and the next flight is like 3-4 days later.,btohqsg
huh i guess if it was smth unexpected that they noticed,btohqsg
Since the aircraft did not even fly to SG,btohqsg
but i usually won't blame the airline itself for cancelling,btohqsg
if they had notice earlier then they should have said so,btohqsg
They only have 4 planes at their disposal with 6 destinations.,btohqsg
did they like rebook them onto another flight or smth,btohqsg
No. The staff just showed him a list of alternative flights and how to obtain refund. Yeah that ‚Äòs it.,btohqsg
this old ppl talk ah ^^,btohqsg
yk I talk abt jobs and all but idek if my father lets me help üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Only one parent is working for me,btohqsg
right ofc bfr inflation was a thing,btohqsg
I tot Chas card was normal help,btohqsg
old man uses the word flex,btohqsg
can't relate I was only 6,btohqsg

back then 7k was top tier,btohqsg
eh in my case  i didn't even take o levels so i didn't get much of a break there. had some personal issues after A levels until NS,btohqsg
then after NS i did an intern,btohqsg
only part time I've done is tutoring lol,btohqsg
if you count PSLE as being smart ig,btohqsg
i mean PSLE to me just tests how early your learning capabilities develop,btohqsg
i did well for PSLE despite not studying like at all  but i really don't think i'm smart or anything,btohqsg
just saying cos i messed up everything up to A levels,btohqsg
flexing over PSLE is the most stupid thing ever LOL,btohqsg
eh but that means ur sch good,btohqsg
Bedok can be q inspirational in the worst ways possible,btohqsg
only reason I tell people i never study for PSLE is just to illustrate my point,btohqsg
that it's not a good assessment,btohqsg
for example  discriminating against his own kind,btohqsg
idk maybe i developed my skills of learning earlier compared to most,btohqsg
is ur description jap or chi ee,btohqsg
eh but mine abit the late ah,btohqsg
i mean learning got many types,btohqsg
Bcz there's a random jap character,btohqsg
pri sch's most important skill is teaching you how to learn,btohqsg
I only figured out how I study effectively like a week bfr the olvls,btohqsg
pal let me tell you smth,btohqsg
i figured out how to study effectively,btohqsg
in uni year 1 sem 2,btohqsg
i just somehow managed to scrape by into uni,btohqsg
and figured it out before flunking,btohqsg
but u got into uni regardless....,btohqsg
too early to think about that right,btohqsg
the fact that you found out how to study effectively alr at this point,btohqsg
you alr thinking further ahead than a lot of people lmao,btohqsg
yeah we'll see when I get my results..,btohqsg
"I think some people will say this is ""settling for mediocrity""  but if you can get by e.g. just pass  there are people who are gonna be worst off than you e.g. have to retake",btohqsg
i guess that's me then last time,btohqsg
I say I touch your hand,btohqsg
u see ah. u cannot sit with your hand mah.,btohqsg
is this some post Os high,btohqsg
i think ive also gone mad liao,btohqsg
i dreamt about someone murdering me,btohqsg
I got a million dollar assasination contract,btohqsg
welp im still alive so you failed ur job,btohqsg
omg this reminds ne of zhongli quest now,btohqsg
i didnt eat bread yesterday at least,btohqsg

"""I dreamt about killing you"" - Ye",btohqsg
Its a symptom of my poison,btohqsg
damn imagine being a rich assasin,btohqsg
or maybe not a dream. can practice on Hui Ting first,btohqsg
you only have 65 hours now,btohqsg
"The subject that got guys asking ""How is it like to retake A Levels during NS?"" on r/NationalServiceSG even though it's literally the first paper...",btohqsg
since I have ntg to do,btohqsg
'is the pri sch GEP programme a good idea?',btohqsg
i forgot gp for jc existedüò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
i thought he was talking abt general practitioner,btohqsg
bro thinking abit too far ah,btohqsg
I feel like   as someone who was in a sch which has GEP programme.. there was a barrier between the GEP kids and the mainstream,btohqsg
like i still rmbr  art class we had to combine  and goddamn they were like so hostile towards us,btohqsg
yeah now I even hear that parents send their kids for GEP tuition to get into the prog,btohqsg
No point actually tbh waste money only,btohqsg
but i feel they slaughter the bell curve,btohqsg
because my brother was in GEP.. and like a few of his classmates actually went TLL (learning lab) for some GEP prep course into the prog,btohqsg
good to seperate for sake of late bloomers,btohqsg
I mean . that's most GEP girls tbh,btohqsg
like if u go rgs ah.. you'll get those type of girls,btohqsg
My primary sch also have gep if yall heard of this sch called rosyth,btohqsg
all got money  and got brains ah,btohqsg
OFC I ALWAYS DO THE PAPERS BFR PRELIMS üôèüôè,btohqsg
alot of them no money alsoi,btohqsg
den my mother is like wah so smart get 90%..,btohqsg
in actual fact  i copy ans sheet,btohqsg
I legit don't und ur paper,btohqsg
eh but the very poor ppl are the real g,btohqsg
Hahahaha tbh Idk I just survived lol,btohqsg
But my prelims and my psle was a very big difference I wld say the gap and the difficulty,btohqsg
Original intention of GEP wasn't for the rich,btohqsg
last time SG families not enough $$ one,btohqsg
i think for people like sheldon,btohqsg
my time  fishball noodle in hawker centre is $1.20,btohqsg
my house is still 25 dollars tho,btohqsg
Lor Mee was $1.50 that time.,btohqsg
My dad always happily comment that $10 can feed family of four  including 2 large cups of sugar cane,btohqsg
ya lo  some sch siao liao,btohqsg
this was at the hawker centre at Kovan,btohqsg
milo is bottle or packet one,btohqsg
must be good  now $10 can only feed my sister and brother happy meal,btohqsg
mine is Milo large tho idk,btohqsg
the small Milo is $0.60 very happy,btohqsg
go poly I go cry no money alr,btohqsg
I think poly Milo $1.20/$1.50 I forgot,btohqsg
wah shit that is hella good,btohqsg
now everyone so rich liao.Last time pri sch my pocket money is 60 cents a day,btohqsg
this one was when I went sp,btohqsg
is not rich  is the basic money rn,btohqsg
Bruh poly stuff almost expensive as outside,btohqsg
u bring $3 to pri sch  buy noodle   need scrap thru for drinks,btohqsg
When I am in JC  I finally got $5 a day,btohqsg
pri school i got $2 a day,btohqsg
now sec sch I only spend $4,btohqsg
Bruh I got no pocket money in primary sch,btohqsg
I mean .. so you're THAT old,btohqsg
I only got in sec sch,btohqsg
my A level was year 2001,btohqsg
2001 was the year the planes crash into the twin towers,btohqsg
my friends pocket allowance was 70 a week,btohqsg
then i was like wow rich kids,btohqsg
i work part time in jc also,btohqsg
can someone calculate how much is that per day I can't,btohqsg
and there  you succeeded in driving a wedge between your friend and his family,btohqsg
likely his fam didn't know earlier,btohqsg
I mean it's better than getting a 3.9 gpa but not apply scholarship for uni,btohqsg
even for jc students its hard,btohqsg
At least the rates not as high as Kr,btohqsg
Yea the IT IGP spike is crazy,btohqsg
Parents banned me from entering IT,btohqsg
they making the highest salaries after being looked down,btohqsg
i feel its too saturated tho,btohqsg
i put in the wromng group econs,btohqsg
i mean i heard a lot of my peers going IT route but suffering.. it's quite debatable imo  IT is def for interest  if uw pursue IT for money  rly go say goodbye to ur mental health  but if you find the journey worth it.. then up to you   but always rmbr that the world is ever changing  there may sudd be a decrease in demand for IT or lesser job opportunities because bots can do more simpler task,btohqsg
you scared me I was like what is Joel typing,btohqsg
my dad said first 5 years are hard,btohqsg
I alr lost myself w 3hrs  of sleep everyday,btohqsg
the juniors do all the coding,btohqsg
Else be Ur own boss :^),btohqsg
but they should have more ways to climb,btohqsg
that would be worse no? if u open up pathways at a younger age,btohqsg
cos ppl dk what they wanna even in their 20s  dont talk about teenager or  preteen years,btohqsg
then they would already be behind those that adopted or bought into those training pathways early,btohqsg
I only found out I hated coding when I became a full stack developer,btohqsg
I wan dropp out of sch go poly,btohqsg
Especially when alot IT can self learn.,btohqsg
also some people shit at language,btohqsg
you should come to nus chs,btohqsg
I can't do english language but can do coding language,btohqsg
so education system is not optimised,btohqsg
I remember my english was a 39/100 and my math 95+/100,btohqsg
2 of the core mods i took this sem discussed meritocracy alot,btohqsg
They shud do more on strength ~,btohqsg
so I used the record voice to text translation,btohqsg
IT jobs only really took off the last few years due to remote workBut it remains to see what happens in the next few year.Imagine if you were working happily at Meta or Twitter  then kenna retrenched near age 40.The middle age crisis is real.,btohqsg
as much as singapore has great education  does it address the aims of students these days? for example  some students want to pursue in law   then it wld mean that their humanities and english must be proficient. and their math could be mediocre. but if we look back  and the student is forced to do a sci/math subj in JC as their h1 subj  it cld ultimately eliminate their chances of going to law since it prolly requires you to get AAA/A which the student may not be able to achieve since their not strong in that area of study  hence not able to achieve their aim just because the education system does not allow us to only focus on our strengths,btohqsg
English is a medium of communication.Maths is a tool to train analytical skills.Does a lawyer need analytical skills?,btohqsg
You can't deny that the future students will face a greater competitiveness than us,btohqsg
