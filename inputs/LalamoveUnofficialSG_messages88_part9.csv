this tactic most important for City Square Residences. No deliveries on Sun/PH and after 8pm on other days. those GF/FP people on bike/e-bike/bicycle all part outside/nearby then walk in with the makan.,btohqsg
City Square Residence.. Mostly CECA stay there.,btohqsg
Wow ystd 380 today 400 liao.. another driver bit the bait,btohqsg

That whole condo look very rundown too,btohqsg
But the price there is good lol,btohqsg
Won't be surprise Melville Park also like this. I haven't been there ever since I last drove PHV few years ago.,btohqsg
PHV most hate places. City Square Residence  Tanjong Rhu whole row of condo especially The Waterside and Melville Park.,btohqsg
Cause the security guard very anal?,btohqsg
Or the demographics of the population there,btohqsg
Resident  if deliver food okay. U try Amazon. Call until phone bomb also no one pickup.,btohqsg
Amazon delivery abit knn wan. They put delivery slot  then when deliver they purposely not at home.,btohqsg
