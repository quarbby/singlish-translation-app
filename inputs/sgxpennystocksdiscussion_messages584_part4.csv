💡Ask Pika Series #8🔦There appear to be a plethora of questions on what happens when your Chinese counters get delisted. While it is anyone's guess  below are three possible paths that Pika World believes could be the scenario.💰#1: Shares BuybackThe Chinese company would buy back its shares from investors based on an agreed price with the shareholders. This is a path towards privatization. But  of course  if the company aims to go public  it can do so with a separate listing  such as in Hong Kong.📲#2: Share TransferInvestors would exchange their Chinese ADR shares for the company's foreign stocks. Unfortunately  since Didi does not have any secondary listing  it will need to possibly begin a listing in perhaps Hong Kong or Shanghai to begin the transfer mechanism for its ADRs.🧨#3: Trap Big TimeIf Didi does not buy back its shares and does not begin a new listing  then the ability to trade its shares are in jeopardy. Essentially  investors will own the company's equity but are unable to do normal trading in a regulated exchange. There is the likelihood of trading in the over-the-counter markets (like Luckin Coffee which Pika Nat holds) for some. The downside is OTC counters have limited liquidity  and you might be in a trap to hold till a new listing is commenced.We hope you enjoy this read. Have a wonderful lunch!Cheers Pika Nat,btohqsg

"211210#MarketAnalysisFor market to ""rest"" on Wednesday and Thursday is normal due to the strong move upside on Monday and Tuesday. IF S&P D1 closes below half of Thesday's body or worse  closes below Tuesday body  then bears are going to attack. But I don't think it will happen towards the bearish as Wednesday and Thursday's volume is a lot lower than Monday and Tuesday. Therefore I think  we should be going higher which means you have to pay attention to world indices. But having said that  tonight 9:30pm (GMT+8) will have CPI news and it would not be a surprise if the inflation is a lot higher than expected which may trigger a more aggressive tapering in next week FOMC meeting. But I would be looking to see after the CPI news is out and if market goes lower  I will be watching for intraday bullish candles to see if market can go higher. If it can go higher  this may mean we should be going to all time high in S&P next week.",btohqsg
