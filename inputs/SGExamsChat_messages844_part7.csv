Anything new or worth visiting in Singapore ?,btohqsg
I going for Christmas Wonderland tonight only,btohqsg
i heard that singtel wifi is worse LOLOL,btohqsg
Teach foreigners how to pronounce Tham Pee Knees? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
u can try checking outilumi singapore  or if you're heading home later in the night; try to catch a glimpse of theSpectra Light & Water Showthat's outside MBS,btohqsg
but u should just select a few places to go before ur christmas wonderland,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t that the The Art Science musuem?,btohqsg
otherwise confirm tired by the time u reach gardens by the bay,btohqsg
but different timings  locations & dates,btohqsg
this year's one idk if it was at MBS or ArtScience Museum,btohqsg
probably this:'What is it trying to promote?' Banner calling for passers-by to stare at Tanjong Pagar residents' windows causes confusion,btohqsg
Jewel - drop luggage at 3pm - punggol - chinatown/maxwell - marina barrage - xmas wonderland,btohqsg
actually  sounds pretty jam-packed for one day alr,btohqsg
Is it lol I think mostly is getting  stuck at MRT ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
although I think Chinatown/Maxwell wld be more interesting than punggol,btohqsg
Better buy ticket in advance from Klook. A few of my friends went to Art Science Museum on different days planning to get tickets on the spot all experienced sold out,btohqsg
Beats me ðŸ˜‚ my friend plan I just follow,btohqsg
Guess which movie i gg to watch tmr,btohqsg
idk what pg movies are there,btohqsg
if u are watching a chinese movie tmr  can share (recs),btohqsg
can just be a X/10 rating as well,btohqsg
tbh i like the musical so im not going into it blind,btohqsg
giga q okay what  been using for a two-ish years now no problem,btohqsg
lately  giga's parent company aka starhub has issues popping up more often than the last two years,btohqsg
i think i have my current hp plan under giga for around 2 years also,btohqsg
but this year  idk why suddenly it became rabak liddat,btohqsg
i heard a lot of fans of the original wicked musical  having a bunch of mixed reactions,btohqsg
but honestly i'll say just enjoy wtv u can LOL,btohqsg
I watched the musical many years ago by an Australian cast and have been listening to the album by the original broadway cast over the years. I wonâ€™t call myself a fan and I enjoyed the movie â€” went in thinking I might not have the attention span of more than 2.5 hours but time flew by,btohqsg
ðŸ˜… was planning to turn off my laggy Apple Watch   but accidentally hit Emergency SOS and cancelled call never knew Singapore 999 would reply aSMS ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Hopefully wonâ€™t randomly call me tomorrow ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Until I accidentally get a fine hahaha,btohqsg
Anyway Christmas Wonderland kinda a no go tbh ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Need to get a Light box and wide angle DSLR  else canâ€™t see shit,btohqsg
feels like just a place to take photos with partners,btohqsg
Yeahhh sadly no see people doing interesting photoshoots tho,btohqsg
Basically this was the entire highlight otherwise pretty much mehhh ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Also given the fact now is rainy and Singapore Humid weather + 20mins walk to this place -I really kennot ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Hopefully the free ones around Orchard would be good,btohqsg
Oh ya I ended up in Punggol just for the sakes that my friend want to purchase a cheap SAFRA $6 workout T-shirt ðŸ¤¨,btohqsg
Yeahhh really random. But quite an interesting area sat the LRT saw quite high density Condo / HDB Apartments,btohqsg
actually  i don't think ppl are even allowed to set up any bulky photography equipment in events,btohqsg
there's even rules on what kind of camera tripods are allowed LOL,btohqsg
that's why u will probably see more selfie sticks instead,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think most people get a tripods nowadays. Especially those bulky sturdy camera ones,btohqsg
especially for those professional or hobbyist,btohqsg
haha  ya this is a given,btohqsg
For budget traveller for me flying budget airlines. A tripod easily eats up 1-2kg already lol,btohqsg
Unless you really add on luggage or travel by Bus to Singapore ðŸ¤£ or Kaya enough to buy one in SG.,btohqsg
do u usually make use of hand carry + luggage?,btohqsg
