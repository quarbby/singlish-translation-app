Hi guys how do I check the rewards points given by HSBC? It doesn’t seem to tally,btohqsg
What SG stock is good can give me some reco,btohqsg
How do you tally it? Based on the transactions printed on your current statement?,btohqsg
I linked my card to heymax to see how many points I receive per transaction,btohqsg
I spent close to 1k in April but I’ve only received 950 points so just wanted to verify,btohqsg
Your statement is from 01 -30 Apr? Points are calculated based oncalendarmonth whereas your statement is based onstatementmonth.,btohqsg
My statement month is from 2 Apr to 2 May so it shouldn’t differ too much right?,btohqsg
Tier 2 stocks 10k for stocks then if your 10k is in sg mmf still worthwhile,btohqsg
Bonus points for Apr transactions will only be credited next month (Jun),btohqsg
Ah I see. Ok thanks for helping!,btohqsg
Is ocbc 365 still worth going for currently. I have a 360 account,btohqsg
Can you comfortably hit $800 min spend in the specified categories?Recommend:- Utilities $150- Bus/MRT $100- Restaurants $350- Groceries $200,btohqsg
Abit difficult I feel. Probably will stuck around 500-600,btohqsg
If you can't hit $800  go for OCBC Infinity.After spending above $500  you will get 0.6% interest on your OCBC360.,btohqsg
I'm currently using amaze rewards only. Was thinking for a second card.,btohqsg
And the infinity card looks super cool.,btohqsg
The infinity card is there any mcc restrictions,btohqsg
Only the standard exclusions like insurance and utilities,btohqsg

Hi If I opened new UOB account on 30 April and deposited 150k fresh funds  and registered the promo  do I qualify for the big savings payout promotion $1000 cash for 150k tier  because the money is not locked until now.Or should i have put in the money on 1 May instead?,btohqsg
It will be earmark by end of may  dont touch the money,btohqsg
Those who have applied for SC account in Jan 2024  and qualifed for T&Cs.Should have received SMS (4 Apr 2024) to collect Samsonite luggage at ShortQ @ CentrepointLast day of collection 31 May 2024,btohqsg
Your registered on 30 Apr right?,btohqsg
Ok I seeI dont touch the $150kAnd at the same time i want to earn the 4% interest. So I need to put in salary of $1600 n spend $500 on the debit card every month. The excess money is it ok to be there ?,btohqsg
Yes i registered 30/4 around 6-7pm,btohqsg
Yes  with debit card u need to be careful  put more money inside as it will withdraw from the uob one acct,btohqsg
I would suggest to use CC instead.. debit card touches the funds inside the bank account which will be risky,btohqsg
Please watch this video on debit card concerns (especially those linked to your HISA)https://youtu.be/hKP_lFgjBmw?si=ZG0TfCAGVzp9eV2x,btohqsg
Account holder currently works as intern  not enough annual income to sign up for CC,btohqsg

Hi everyone  am new here. I’m currently trying to apply for a citi rewards miles card but have been rejected. Was wondering if there’s any other ways for me to apply it as the online application has been rejecting me. I’m currently working  earning between $2500-$3000  it varies. Is there a way to show citi my payslip from my company? :),btohqsg
Maximum is 4% at $150 000?,btohqsg
u applying via Singpass? income documents are CPF statement and IRAS NOA?,btohqsg
But last year i worked for half a year  so my annual salary wasnt >$30k,btohqsg
just don't apply with Citibank then. Apply with other banks which can provide you with better rewards and conditions such as UOB.or just put $10k FD down to get a secured version,btohqsg
