GME style short squeeze coming ?,btohqsg
I think today consider T+4 liao...last week volume up on 3 feb le....but big one is thur...the 30mil mentioned which was traded on 5 feb..Yes üôèüôèüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ,btohqsg
all of us united.. and force BB to buy higher lah..,btohqsg
lol sg cmi la. no diamond band one,btohqsg
More than 50% discount from last price,btohqsg
Not so good hor  last traded is 0.012,btohqsg
Does it mean that tml will raise.. As seller will want to sell their lots higher price.,btohqsg
BBs can afford to play with retailers and let them SL themselves. They have no obligation to push high until they see that most sellers are done selling,btohqsg
yesit will take some time thenprobably 1 day?do call their customer service,btohqsg
Just checked with them  they mentioned need wait around 24-72 hrs before it will be ready for tradeDidn‚Äôt know SG market so special  first time trade US market dont have this issue,btohqsg
because dont need set up custodian,btohqsg
but since you are in USjust continue USDdont come SGD,btohqsg
You mean SG no need set up custodian so take longer or US?,btohqsg
i mean you started off USso tiger assumed you will deal with US only and never set up the etc admin stuff for SG,btohqsg
i think lanot surei do not work therejust thought to help answer since no one respond to you and this is new,btohqsg
Oh I see  thanks for helping out!,btohqsg
for austrailia more troublesome for sure,btohqsg
no problembut seriously stay in US,btohqsg
even i am going 50 50 US SG soon,btohqsg
What stock in US to recommend though? Tesla  Nio?,btohqsg
so many to research but the main reason for my US is to trade 16hours since i taking it as full time already,btohqsg
but now not sure if good time to USmaybe alibaba?,btohqsg
mainly due to lack of options trading,btohqsg
learning how illiquid sg market actually is üòÖü§£,btohqsg
Compare SG and US  can tell the volume is low in sg,btohqsg
But US market quite scary  can up and down very fast,btohqsg
and hoursus have pre and post,btohqsg
spend time in US market better laSG also having lesser and lesser good companies and good companies that stay undervalued perpetually is not uncommon,btohqsg
no problemmake money remember to donate to me,btohqsg
Thought u bb  still need my small donation ah? Hahaha,btohqsg
ya i started investing in US market just this year LOL,btohqsg
which is why need donationsame for meSam brought me to US and i saw a whole new world at my age,btohqsg
Yup. I lose a few k in ug.. So if there is a chance to win bck. I might go in again,btohqsg
Hard to say. 3 feb buyers might already unload for profit on 5 feb. It's the 5 Feb buyers who r due this thur that need to watch too. T+4 not always drop. Non T+4 not always up.,btohqsg
Ug up n down beri fast,btohqsg
Wrong already. Instead of jasmine  it needs to be the genie,btohqsg
"quote from furion""If something illiquid become liquidU pay premium price"" üòÜ",btohqsg
Wah u looking for me ah,btohqsg
