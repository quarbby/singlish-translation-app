text,group
the sentence just fit right in to your name,btohqsg
Taking pride in NS work is nice  but it’s a bit like Stockholm syndrome,btohqsg
"my point is just it makes people look pathetic when they say shit like ""oh why aint women doing NS  have compulsory NS for women too""",btohqsg
You’re here already  so you may as well like it,btohqsg
dread it  love it  still 2yrs no more no less,btohqsg
and you know the government ain't doing anything about it  so why bother?,btohqsg
we're the ones suffering  just let us rant,btohqsg
Idu whats rhe point of this grp sticker,btohqsg
we complain so much the govt also won't do shit,btohqsg
not like govt will remove conscription :(,btohqsg
It was supposedly back when NS kept flooding this group chat,btohqsg
It was back in a time when everything in this group was about NS,btohqsg
So someone (I think kueh) may this sticker to stfu the chao recruits,btohqsg
Hm i guess No NS is indeed uust a meme,btohqsg
all the people whining about how women should do NS are just hateful  but they nato,btohqsg
they talk only but also never do anything,btohqsg
technically u alrd deferred once when u grad from sec sch,btohqsg
There are women in spf. Come to SPF,btohqsg
if I can I would've gone there alr,btohqsg
but too bad SAF wants me more,btohqsg
Yeah u go uni then u sign on,btohqsg
Ur rank lower oni but got bonus,btohqsg
i might sound sexist here but NS help guys not stay 'boys'  without NS more likely people will just be complacent with their life  not all but a lot,btohqsg
Or go to UK and play in Premier league football,btohqsg
How about overseas people with no NS lol,btohqsg
so what you're trying to say here is women aren't complacent w their lives w/o NS,btohqsg
10k a year isnt a lot tho,btohqsg
PH also want talk abt NS kind of nonsense,btohqsg
hari hari NS i tired la...,btohqsg
The RSAF motto actually is Above All,btohqsg
Thats why i used more than sign,btohqsg
Also rsaf is rarely seen after 5,btohqsg
Spf is seen all the time,btohqsg
So y is there always planes flying at night,btohqsg
actually i sort of agree now that i think about it,btohqsg
Would u feel more protected by the chair force or the people in blue,btohqsg
After 4:30pm u cannot see me alfd,btohqsg
What made you change your mind,btohqsg
now that i think about it it is good training ground for people to not completely be useless  trains people mentally and physically  learn leadership skills etc,btohqsg
Well  if a hostile bomber came into the airspace,btohqsg
not really about the military itself  more of developing people,btohqsg
Like a compulsory 2 year government internship,btohqsg
Actually nvm ppl arent mature enuf here,btohqsg
I thought is only follow orders lol,btohqsg
If you’re occifer or Sgt u can give orders,btohqsg
Recognition is not like internships lol,btohqsg
And to gain some ocs ego!,btohqsg
Imagine going ocs then reservist extend to age 55 lol,btohqsg
huh? sg military like that one uh?,btohqsg
as in i hear my overseas friends,btohqsg
their experience not like that one,btohqsg
No one will defame their own millitary to foreigners,btohqsg
Lower rank listen to higher rank,btohqsg
But u see how sexist they are,btohqsg
That’s kind of the main idea of the military,btohqsg
And how fked up it is inside there,btohqsg
The nazis also followed orders too,btohqsg
Well  a lot of good people also followed orders,btohqsg
Damn its almost as if u r following orders of ur brain by typing,btohqsg
i heard women who join military overseas get a lot of sexual harrassment,btohqsg
Almost as if ur heart is following orders of ur brain to contract,btohqsg
The army people doing quarantines and contact tracing are also just following orders,btohqsg
Almost as if everythingis following order to under go entropy,btohqsg
Must be free will of the universe,btohqsg
Micro to macro everyone is following a set of rules and orders,btohqsg
Oh ya can't believe Singapore still got woman charter law lol,btohqsg
We are all just following the orders of our DNA,btohqsg
But if werent for that orders and rules,btohqsg
Imagine you divorce and lose 50% of everything,btohqsg
Give me 50% of your money,btohqsg
If let's say John cheats on you and divorce with you,btohqsg
You will still lose 50% lol,btohqsg
Well  at least you do not need to change religion  surrender all your property,btohqsg
So that's not the part that is wrong with the 50%,btohqsg
The part that is wrong is the cheating part,btohqsg
Or just be like me and don't get married,btohqsg
Nah you will give in to your family pressure to get a gf and get married,btohqsg
Ur just marrying a collections of cells anyways,btohqsg
Ha ha dont worry u r. Ull go very far in life,btohqsg
when you enter NS we'll OWADIO,btohqsg
Just think that the world is not so politically correct as I thought,btohqsg
eh just for argument sake what is the argument for girl no need do ns?,btohqsg
dont anything need to become personal attack,btohqsg
The group is alr degen enuf,btohqsg
I heard some people saying that girls do national service by delivering baby,btohqsg
But you see Singapore birth rate,btohqsg
Cause here people dont hce name and pfp,btohqsg
what if they mandate children bearing,btohqsg
Original intention of NS is national military defence. Able bodied males are required to make up the force  so they conscripted the males,btohqsg
Imagine if they had put their name and picture,btohqsg
true that. women can do other jobs no?,btohqsg
Tbh tho they can create a role for females like nurse,btohqsg
I heard Israel got NS compulsory for females and males,btohqsg
ns also got backoffice one ma,btohqsg
not like everyone chiong front lines,btohqsg
PAP already doesn't want to implement live streaming of parliament sessions cause there is no benefit for them,btohqsg
Why do you think they'll impose female conscription,btohqsg
I wanted to become a medic in saf,btohqsg
If they implement live streaming Parliament can see people sleeping,btohqsg
Maybe once birth rate becomes Low enough,btohqsg
no need talk about gov decision,btohqsg
Even if it's beneficial to conscript females,btohqsg
they wont  there'll be backlash from other countries  at most they'll employ propaganda,btohqsg
It doesn't make a difference if they aren't,btohqsg
ur argument about streaming doesnt directly translate over to ns,btohqsg
and the argument of backlash can be used for ANY change,btohqsg
so there would be no change if theres good merit to that argument,btohqsg
I remember this grp had no politica rule,btohqsg
singapore alr has negative rep w regards to being authoritarian  imagine making babies being compulsory,btohqsg
Must be in an alt dimension,btohqsg
Lose votes from female voters ah,btohqsg
Not even China has done that,btohqsg
never did say make baby compulsory,btohqsg
u think all males want baby meh,btohqsg
One is wnuf to rule the world,btohqsg
But suffer short pain now better than delay until the future,btohqsg
The world dun deserve more Neils,btohqsg
Changing the presidency caused a backlash,btohqsg
One is wnuf to rule em all,btohqsg
so its not a fairness argument but a utilitarian one,btohqsg
then it might be the case that implementing zabo ns nothing happen,btohqsg
cant post hoc decide whether a change is good right,btohqsg
Ik a lot who want to serve,btohqsg
Well as a wise man once said,btohqsg
Not arguing whether it's fair or not,btohqsg
Sacrifice of one opens up choices and opportunities for others,btohqsg
need to establish cause effect relationship,btohqsg
Maybe pap scared to lose erection,btohqsg
John is a xmm and he enlisted,btohqsg
"the ""since this has always been the case  it cant be otherwise"" argument is very bad leh",btohqsg
Basically what I feel is that for any change to be instituted  it needs to be beneficial enough,btohqsg
I don't see the point of enlisting females,btohqsg
Is there anyth wrong with that,btohqsg
ur argument is based on theres no marginal increase in utility for zabo to be in ns,btohqsg
lets back up all the way to the start when no policy was made,btohqsg
how would it be/not be beneficial to have zabo in ns,btohqsg
Because you could be the one getting plowed,btohqsg
from nothing to something surely theres some marginal benefit,btohqsg
Maybe if u go thru gp lessons in JC,btohqsg
Ull realise whatever ur typing here,btohqsg
Yep at this point they could have enlist females,btohqsg
Is on the interesting side of a spectrum,btohqsg
since the atrition rate for ns is so high,btohqsg
its basically changing the entire cohort every 2 years,btohqsg
it could very well be a good time to enlist zabo,btohqsg
theres no precursor to stop or prevent marginal increases in utility,btohqsg
I see  and enlist woman then more deterrence towards neighbours lol,btohqsg
It's still the same attrition rate with double the manpower  but okay sure,btohqsg
the moment i see utility i think of econs,btohqsg
yeah double the manpower is cos u already presume that guys must do,btohqsg
It is an econs term haha,btohqsg
Then close ur eyes u wont see utility,btohqsg
yea i learnt that in ec2101,btohqsg
My stand is that you'd probably fare well enlisting women to SAF  because in the end even if they cannot contribute in the most physically taxing situations  they can help out with logistics and transport.,btohqsg
There's always a way to play to their strengths and weaknesses.,btohqsg
Doesn't solve the fairness/unfairness issue but yes,btohqsg
I'm not arguing  that they couldn't enlist females at the start,btohqsg
hes saying that theres no extra utility in getting girls,btohqsg
since he presume guys must and already fill the roles,btohqsg
This I have to disagree  because in saying so you'd assume that you don't need more manpower to grease the gears in SAF (logistics and transport wise),btohqsg
ballot essentially is making ubiquitous randomness true,btohqsg
so many ppl iforget who is who le,btohqsg
in considering the extra utility I guess you'll have to weigh the cost and benefit of including them in the SAF,btohqsg
(cost of food  equipment and lodging versus their utility in SAF),btohqsg
going back utilitarian is hard cause need prove cause and effect,btohqsg
yeah sadly we don't have the numbers to argue all these tbh,btohqsg
right so we mainly theorise on these issues ba,btohqsg
i would say personally as a male if my zabo knows what shit im going through that would be very warming,btohqsg
Then more respect for nsfs ah,btohqsg
I feel like this conversation didn't really bring up anythign new,btohqsg
while waiting ill just add ppl on linkedin,btohqsg
Unless instead of conscription  you just need 1 nuke to serve as deterrence,btohqsg
Those yellow things look like tempura,btohqsg
In terms of fairness yea its unfair that only males have to serve,btohqsg
i still regret not buying that ny shirt in ur dp,btohqsg
i think best way to advance this argument,btohqsg
But if you're waiting for an argument on why females shouldn't serve,btohqsg
is really know the manpower needs of ns,btohqsg
maybe theres just not that much but just to kacao all guys they enlist everyone,btohqsg
"It's really either physical argments or ""utilitarian"" arguments",btohqsg
I would wear it more but,btohqsg
ehh I feel this shirt looks the best when it's just nice,btohqsg
bookshop auntie say dh s and xs alr,btohqsg
sick  xs would be a rly nice fit,btohqsg
i mean the material is actually ok if u wanna exercise in it,btohqsg
btr than the drifit ny shirts,btohqsg
The orientation shirt material is much better,btohqsg
I'm wearing my orientation tee right now,btohqsg
ns singlet > any ny tee HAHAHA,btohqsg
The navy ns singlet is dri fit,btohqsg
I bought the other formation singlets which look decent,btohqsg
Thank you for coming for my ted talk,btohqsg
how to access the youtube video?,btohqsg
John say it's for privacy reason or smt,btohqsg
The video has been privated due to a panelist’s privacy concerns,btohqsg
Apparently an article about the video will be coming out soon,btohqsg
Cant wait to see the man himself  john smith tomorrow again,btohqsg
R we even going to be in the same place,btohqsg
Who knows maybe I will bump into you at the gate,btohqsg
Well guess I will never see smith ever again,btohqsg
Im gonna gauge my eyeballs out,btohqsg
Eyy rec iestin and rec john smith,btohqsg
"*girlfriends scream and rush yall from the stands""",btohqsg
Your family rises up and joins you,btohqsg
And everyone is arrested for breaking social distance,btohqsg
The only training I got off this was my maplestory character,btohqsg
In b4 one nsf does the nazi salute,btohqsg

No wonder I gained 4kg in 2 months,btohqsg
Ah no wonder need to be botak,btohqsg
If not cannot access cerebro like charles xavier,btohqsg
Never mind camp food will start rolling in again,btohqsg
Then I will get disgusted by the taste and naturally eat less leading to less weight gain,btohqsg
I was about to type the name of my camp,btohqsg
Then I realised I even forgotten the name,btohqsg
maybe the suplier supplies to other camps and dorms so they might be saturated,btohqsg
May not get as good food,btohqsg
I have to stay in aftc for another week to finish up the remainder of my course,btohqsg
So its officially goodbye mr smith :(,btohqsg
I’m gonna be in AFTC even longer than you,btohqsg
Somebody enlighten me what’s going on...,btohqsg
He brushes his teeth at 10pm sharp everyday,btohqsg
I gained weight after eating HTA food,btohqsg
Kthxbye need to fold my smart 4,btohqsg
Have u ever been to hta mess,btohqsg
I will not carelessly reveal John Smith's habits,btohqsg
Yeah I’ll be there for 2 more years,btohqsg
Welp aftc's canteen is really nice so quite envious,btohqsg
Nah john smith is a force to reckon with,btohqsg
He could snap my neck if I reveal too much of his identity,btohqsg
I can hear the bone cracking,btohqsg
Time to bust out the army uniforms locked away in the closets for 2 whole months,btohqsg
Soon to be locked away forever,btohqsg
I did and then never touched them again,btohqsg
Actually why is it called smart 4,btohqsg
I have to keep wearing them till after I finish my driving course HAHAH,btohqsg
Besides we wont be receiving our rsaf uniforms anytime soon,btohqsg
