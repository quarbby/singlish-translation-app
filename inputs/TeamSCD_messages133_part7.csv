For my Honda  around 80 to 90 for water temp. But this can go down if things like the thermostat  radiator has been changed.,btohqsg
For oil temp around 90 is a good temp to run the engine. Those with oil coolers installed can see as low as 80 degrees for the oil,btohqsg
Mine the oil temps will run between 90 to 105...,btohqsg
Just now i said those number lor,btohqsg
U shouldnt cross 100 during test drive  which is more like a track temp,btohqsg
If u maintain high rpm for a couple minutes u will see 100-105,btohqsg
Anything above 105 u risk damaging your coolant seals,btohqsg
@BOBBYCWJyour the one that day in the stream rsz right?,btohqsg
I got blackout one for evo  should be can fit if you want it,btohqsg
So even if I get rx8 I can't always run fast on road de?,btohqsg
If u are running high rpm for over 60s you arent in singapore,btohqsg
Also  in about 15 s u will be at 200 already,btohqsg
So if I get this I normal slow drive in sg won't be an issue right,btohqsg
Like slow drive ltr engine have issue,btohqsg
Unless I keep go msia speed then will be an issue?,btohqsg
Cannot always slow... Must every now and then rev up,btohqsg
If you're looking for a car that looks cute then yeah.. Otherwise everyone gem after the NA is a better car overall.,btohqsg
Ummmm slow is a subjective word. Lets just say if you‚Äôre not speeding overheating is not going to be an issue.,btohqsg
If if u go msia  gear 4 climb to 170 and then gear up to 6  your rpm will rest arnd3500-4500,btohqsg
Ultimately its a coe car  get a mechanic / ws to look at it,btohqsg
NB as NA with no pop ups,btohqsg
It also uses the same 1.6L,btohqsg
Cars in sg forever not budget,btohqsg
If test drive 1 round like this ok?,btohqsg
Go workshop n check before buying,btohqsg
I think the oil haven't reach its peak,btohqsg
But I would think if the previous owner got install defi  he would monitor the temps,btohqsg
