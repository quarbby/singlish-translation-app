stalin not as much coz it came our last year alr,btohqsg
yall is it true that end of cw confirm won‚Äôt come out for ehistory,btohqsg
cold war also came out last yr what no meh,btohqsg
like the school didn‚Äôt receive information that there is CLT for history,btohqsg
end of cold war is not tested,btohqsg
uno imma just study sec4 chpts thats it,btohqsg
i mean that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm planning anyway,btohqsg
Take the subject based on uni courses you are aiming for,btohqsg
hybrid means got contrasting subjects right?,btohqsg
Hybrid means 2 sci 2 arts,btohqsg
As a hybrid student of PMEG,btohqsg

The one day I don't have exams  it rains and I could've had an excuse to wear a coat smfh.,btohqsg
Good luck to all having exams today!!,btohqsg
Sorry ah any one here knows where to buy class tees from? Like custom printing,btohqsg
but if u buy more den cheaper,btohqsg
rmb to manage ur time well,btohqsg
where are the elect hist studentssss,btohqsg
so what topic shall we do first,btohqsg
i guess its just the 3 of us ü•≤,btohqsg
start with germany then ww2 in europe,btohqsg
Buy from elprint for my class they charged $8 per tee  free delivery to my school if order above 50 (idk if the offer is still on ah),btohqsg
wait uh y‚Äôall start first i‚Äôm getting ready 4 sch,btohqsg
what led to the rise of hitler,btohqsg
yes anything else other than the govt? I'll say article 48,btohqsg
skilfulness at making deals with other politicians,btohqsg
i think thats pretty much it,btohqsg
there were a few events that happened,btohqsg
positive impact- unemployment reducednegative impact- no autarky- ppl lived in fear- minorities were discriminated and tortured,btohqsg
this is all i rmbr üò≠,btohqsg
Me elect hist grad  does this count?,btohqsg
they were quite close to achieving it,btohqsg
the unemployment reduced issit bc of the union,btohqsg
I still rmb my school SBQ got the ernst rohm,btohqsg
so for the PEEL just say b4 vs after,btohqsg
Sry I only rmb Cold War hahaha üòù,btohqsg
so u say b4 it was like great depression,btohqsg
Sorry guys I'm spelling complicating  shit out,btohqsg
no worries I feel u I tried to rmb that for prelims,btohqsg
but then after hitler came into power  he provided jobs for Germans,btohqsg
and then after  ppl had jobs,btohqsg
he appealed to the rich upper class,btohqsg
another positive impact is actually rearmament maybe?,btohqsg
aft he got the support he eliminated the communists,btohqsg
because b4 that they didnt have much military strength,btohqsg
just KIV this one  because im thinking of this on the spot  my chers didnt actually teach me this,btohqsg
wait do we have to rmb stuff about the hitler youth and maiden stuff,btohqsg
he wanted women to stay home,btohqsg
after this topic I gotta prep for school ya,btohqsg
a lot of countries also didnt join because US itself didnt join,btohqsg
ye bc us was the biggest economy I think,btohqsg
growing german pop.   space was needed  resources were also needed for autarky,btohqsg
policy of app. was the main reason for ww2,btohqsg
but a lot of countries dw to disarm so got conflict,btohqsg
economies weakened  so br reduced government spending,btohqsg
so br gahmen stopped spending on military as well,btohqsg
ye I think we r slowly transitioning to that topic,btohqsg
so appeasing hitler will give them time to properly rearm,btohqsg
they gave hitler which country ah,btohqsg
they also didnt interfere during anschluss,btohqsg
the surrounding of czechoslovakia or poland?,btohqsg
not being able to unite w germany,btohqsg
and the northen schleswig given to denmark,btohqsg
I would like to partially thank oversimplified,btohqsg
and alsace lorraine given back to france,btohqsg
okay sorry I gotta go prep for school! ttyl,btohqsg
and all the profits in saar went to austria i think,btohqsg
ALL THE BEST FOR HIST üò≠,btohqsg
someone give crash course on failure of lon pls,btohqsg
LON failed bc of membership issues,btohqsg
the organisation of roles were bad,btohqsg
USA wasn‚Äôt even in there bc of isolationism,btohqsg
even though they were the richest country at that time,btohqsg
and was stable enough to make decisions for global affairs,btohqsg
oh so without the richest and most powerful country at that time the league was ineffective and couldnt persuade the member countries to do whatever they wanted them to?,btohqsg
yet still america didn‚Äôt join bc they weren‚Äôt keen on any sort of conflict,btohqsg
so i can use that to explain failure?,btohqsg
but again u bear un mind there‚Äôs another factor which was the failure of controlling bigger nations,btohqsg
like they won‚Äôt resort 2 use armed forces 2 solve conflicts like that,btohqsg
bc germany was determined to rearm,btohqsg
i can list down the failure in the abyssinian crisis too right,btohqsg
and when the abyssinia king asked for help,btohqsg
they only imposed limited econ sanctions,btohqsg
cos they were frens w italy,btohqsg
britain and france gave it away to italy as a peace offerinh,btohqsg
but italy wanted the whole of Abyssinia,btohqsg
but dont have to go into detail abthag,btohqsg
gonna go read more on lon rn,btohqsg
when ppl found out there had been a secret deal,btohqsg
and thus looked upon as a failure,btohqsg
yep there's a lot more u can use too  ruhr  aaland  corfu  manchuria,btohqsg
right now i only have abyssinia in my head,btohqsg
this is for example so yea just 2,btohqsg
China appeal to lon but lon demanded jap withdrawal and refused to recognise the puppet govt in manchukuo,btohqsg
hold on for this i typing iut,btohqsg
must we mention abt the mukden incident 4 manchuria?,btohqsg
actually i just send photo ah HAHAH,btohqsg
dont read textbook this is enough,btohqsg
May the weather and tectonics god be in our favour,btohqsg
hm idk unless they ask ig,btohqsg
helloo anyone mind to share pw qna bank for solutions,btohqsg

As someone who took the latter i'd say its pretty managable. Just need consistency.,btohqsg
Either way you still need SS,btohqsg

Hey guys! Studyramen here üçúMental health is a topic that's discussed in great depths recently and it's a topic that we feel is of utmost importance to the wellbeing of students ‚ù§Ô∏èWith many of us facing our own personal battles  we've came up with an article providing students with resources on where to go to should they need a listening ear. In our article  we've compiled a list of counselling centres along with details like cost and location. You can check it out here üëáCounselling Centres in Singapore:https://studyramen.com/articles/counselling-centres-in-singapore-free-and-affordable-services/Through this article  we also hope to destigmatize counselling/therapy -- it is perfectly normal to find someone to talk to.We hope you take some time to read up on our article and we'll be here to answer any of your questions üí™To end this off  it is perfectly okay to share your struggles and express your emotions without shame ‚ù§Ô∏è We're all on our own journey towards growth and healing.

Anyone got pure geog ans key,btohqsg
thats true a little birdie told me also,btohqsg
Someone explain to me the bell curve,btohqsg
I heard you‚Äôre not guaranteed an A1 if you get 75% and above,btohqsg
There's not really a bell curve for national exams but there's something called 'moderation'. If paper easy grade thresholds shift up. Paper hard shift down,btohqsg
After marking all the scripts  if the examiners feel that compared to last year  the performance of candidates have improved  distinction and pass rates will increase,btohqsg
So actually there's not really a bell curve since the percentage of students awarded each grade is not fixed,btohqsg
Nah they are not suppose to do that,btohqsg
i wont be surprised if it happens anyways,btohqsg
Who would want to go to jail or get fined.,btohqsg
anyone got pure geog ans ?,btohqsg
30 min after paper start u cannot take exam anyway,btohqsg
