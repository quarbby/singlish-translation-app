Wtf is the qn with so many lines,btohqsg
then dont do that qn lor,btohqsg
at least its better than the or question lol,btohqsg
Because can’t use sin i/sin r just like that,btohqsg
If so Didn’t they already say something like refractive index of glass is 1.5 there,btohqsg
That’s if it’s air to other medium,btohqsg
Then we supposed to use that value,btohqsg
nah i studied that chp but still dk,btohqsg
i got daunted by the 3m qn to set up the scale,btohqsg
The angle of refraction  was sin^-1(sin 30 x 1.5),btohqsg
Cuz pure and comb also got test refraction,btohqsg
But is the deviation must minus incidence from refraction,btohqsg
I mean minus refraction from incidence,btohqsg
Worry next year when get result,btohqsg
Got ppl hv pure hums too,btohqsg
U didnt see that didnt u,btohqsg
Oh so n of glass given,btohqsg
