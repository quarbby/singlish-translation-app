Made in SG: How homegrown Artdeshine started manufacturing its own car care products and exporting them all over the worldThey're all made right here in Singapore.👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you are proud of them for flying the Singapore flag high in the car detailing industry!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
But I know 2022 Tesla hv hud,btohqsg
No ar model 3 nothing q lol,btohqsg
Since it can auto drive then don need already,btohqsg
Why the Benz appear as dustbin?,btohqsg
u paying 250k but no good speakers...#Shortchanged,btohqsg
okay la its not too bad but Mr Pete expects premium speakers!,btohqsg
What happened to having as an option for consumers to use when car is not on autodrive?,btohqsg
U want hud for wad? Auto drive > hud,btohqsg
its not i want the HUD bro... is you,btohqsg
I told u already if got auto drive no need hud,btohqsg
HUD some ppl like but not expensive to do ma,btohqsg
Doesn’t matter. It should be there based on your matrix. Not like auto drive 100% of the time. I assume you know how it works?,btohqsg
Just go a 3rd party workshop can lioa,btohqsg
Ya but they give me more advanced stuff which is auto drive,btohqsg
Cannot cannot. Must spend money. It should be installed as a standard for some buyers.,btohqsg
so you skip the other basic stuff ah  next time u just dont lock your tesla,btohqsg
Why would u want basic thing when they give u advanced thing?,btohqsg
how are you comparing HUD with Autodrive,btohqsg
AW MANNNN!!! shld have came as standard,btohqsg
Standard then plus arf die liao,btohqsg
The car will be 80 k omv lol,btohqsg
Tesla drive for u already. Which car can auto drive as well as Tesla,btohqsg
sir... many cars can auto drive leh,btohqsg
tesla cannot lvl 5 autonomous in SH,btohqsg
I Say which car can auto drive better than tesla?,btohqsg
basically its a level playing field,btohqsg
tesla cant even full auto drive in sg bro,btohqsg
Drive so much for u u still want level 5?,btohqsg
Yes. Really some don’t want to understand this.,btohqsg
U expecting beyond a hud already,btohqsg
Ok la not car. Is a bus 🤣,btohqsg
i have no idea whow u even compare hud to autodrive,btohqsg
u shld be comparing cruise control to auto drive,btohqsg
Like I said. Ppl give u advanced thing u still complain,btohqsg
auto drive also need pay hor,btohqsg
why never come as standard for both,btohqsg
dont shift the arguement to my preferences,btohqsg
They give u auto drive u want hud for wad?,btohqsg
N u still complain auto drive not powerful enough,btohqsg
U are saying that HUD shld be standard,btohqsg
just like auto drive  its a paid option,btohqsg
I already said if can auto drive no need hud,btohqsg
U want me repeat how many times then u happy,btohqsg
i think this is gonna win me my most active award 2 months in a row,btohqsg
Who use that “self drive” mode 100% of the time? Going by how fast Teslas accelerate here in Singapore off traffic lights  I’m guessing most don’t use that function except maybe on highways,btohqsg
u want all but dont want HUD,btohqsg
U don’t stupid. That 1 is Lambo,btohqsg
Then when the modes are not being used  how? without HUD?,btohqsg
First learn how to read properly can,btohqsg
I Don’t want waste time repeat,btohqsg
Ok we are the ones being stupid here,btohqsg
bro just push the car already,btohqsg
no hud cannot drive the car,btohqsg
I realise talk here no need think 1,btohqsg
"""bro my fsd stop working  i cant drive for sh!t  help me tow to tpy""",btohqsg
Let’s ask actual Tesla driver here,btohqsg
@bbfasingaporehow often do you use the self drive mode sir?,btohqsg
genuinely  many tesla driver have the speedometer add on,btohqsg
ive seen group buys in tesla groups,btohqsg
I only use in highway when jam,btohqsg
U want see speed for wad? Nowadays ppl drive blindfold,btohqsg
Don’t know la hahaha the speed on the screen is good enoigh,btohqsg
Actually a lot of driver don’t use auto drive also haha,btohqsg
when you drive you dont need to see whether you are speeding ah,btohqsg
the speed indication on a tesla is not along your required line of sight when you drive,btohqsg
Ya got more feel. Auto drive is like wear condom. No feel,btohqsg
U No need la. U depend on feel 1,btohqsg
Will get used to it 1,btohqsg
I get used to it that why never install,btohqsg
And Depent  on how u drive   if u are not those very aggressive driver most of the time u are cruising behind a road hogger or heavy traffic   don’t even need to to see the speed haha,btohqsg
https://m.sgcarmart.com/articles/articleinfo.php?CT=n&AID=26884Love the new subtile design. The last generation is overdone.,btohqsg
Park this with Honda EuroR CL7 they will look sama sama 🤣,btohqsg
Exactly that too! 😄😄 to MrPete’s point. So for the times they’re not driving on auto drive (which seems to be off most of the time - I mean the mode arrr… not Mr Pete)  no HUD how? Problem.,btohqsg
No need auto drive 1. Just put the gear on reverse then we can blindfold n push the car to save the trees,btohqsg

You will be surprised with their Engine quality. Ride and technology are there. Or maybe perhaps it’s C&C service quality issue?,btohqsg
yep i saw it yesterday! properly good car haha  very underrated in SG,btohqsg
Can kipper French car. Unless you like French chic! Their design are really good compared to Japanese. Spare parts are expensive so better reconsider if you need the car most of the time. Car in workshop is bad reputation for reliability.,btohqsg
Ok I believe you. Please send me one car sir,btohqsg

Why don’t you consider Alfa just like the video I posted,btohqsg
Maybe NS highway all the way maybe,btohqsg
Have patience. Coe will fall and fall hard,btohqsg
I also think will drop as intreast rate is increasing,btohqsg
It should. Now banks would have increase their interest rates for car loans  it should put the middle class away from car ownership. The upper class  they will still buy car  perhaps a lower tier or base model,btohqsg
It is known that COE will hit the middle class  especially those really dire in need (e.g. mobility issues),btohqsg
Yeah  indeed like an oven now,btohqsg
new jazz  can lose 30k depre in a few months if coe drop,btohqsg
conclusion: rent first  wait for coe to drop,btohqsg
Ps was referring to the SGcarmart list.,btohqsg
I believe u will be kicked,btohqsg
But coe is a control thing also   lta can change the quota anytime,btohqsg
we wait and see  no rush to buy,btohqsg
Now is definitely keep cash first,btohqsg
u buy 3 months ltr u lose 20k straight on a damn jazz,btohqsg
Intreast rate going high   means spending will reduce as company hard and won’t loan,btohqsg
Now company going bust as the bridging loan 1 year is up and time to pay,btohqsg
if you take high loan  wont be able to down next car,btohqsg
Ally of company is just survive using loan,btohqsg
dont bother buying now  just wait,btohqsg
Actually car is best don’t take loan la,btohqsg
i got friend pay for 992 C4S in cash,btohqsg

We should do a poll   do you floor the car at least once a week,btohqsg
https://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1101884When your COE endCOE price should drop👍Last COE high 2015. New low 20192022 COE High2026 COE Low. Bcos alot of 2016 Uber's Lion City/GetGo cars will be scrapped.All the SL plate CarsSmelly smelly 25 000,btohqsg
I always seem to renew at the lows. 2009 and 2019,btohqsg
This cycle is kinda different cause due to heavy inflation   more higher income family and transition to ev,btohqsg
It good to draw reference but some time things changes,btohqsg
No ppl know   it Depent on too many factor issue liao,btohqsg
Ard 40k-50kThe nation progress richerMore wealthy migrating here.They have 💰  ask dealer 3-5 bid.,btohqsg
i floor but like no effect,btohqsg
my 0-100 3 business days upon manager approval,btohqsg
Actually I got a thought is that car price might not go down much already even coe go down by 50%   cause now Singapore is transiting to ev   and car dealers will have to mark up the margin to keep afloat,btohqsg
Cannot be.Unless another Ponzi scheme happened 100-200billion  happened.All big bank falls for it😂Madoff kind,btohqsg
And with the war and inflation   maybe car price just keep going higher only haha,btohqsg
Winner what car you driving why don’t need to floor at all 1,btohqsg
Car should be cheaper. More car manufacturing move to China or out of China. Depends  KIA Sonet manufacture in India.COEs always depends on quota. If new quotas more than available quota. It's a  Bidding war.,btohqsg
War... Stepping on thin thread now.😢,btohqsg
Problem with ev is no maintenance  so a big cut of profit is gone for servicing. That why the transition to ev car should cost higher,btohqsg
Don't need to service. Or maintenance or repair.Just like mobile phone.Every 6mth new versionOr battery 🔋 Dies.  Battery got per charge life span. Average 1300 charge for mobile phone. Not sure for cars battery.If Change battery is too expensive  driver will change cars.Your Tesla battery from Stuttgart motor was 100 000?,btohqsg
Monthly update is free   and can be done at home   with no maintenance ad and dealer profit margin been take away a big pie,btohqsg
So to me they should factor in at the selling price to keep afloat,btohqsg
Ev is like upfront cost high   but low running cost,btohqsg
this war n spike in oil seems like a  conspiracy do switch all to EV,btohqsg
Nah. Politics stuff.Saudi Arabia angry with US.Refuse to pump more oil and start selling Oil in CNY.😅Just pray China don't go to war.They will store food/water/oil.Small country. Good Game.,btohqsg
I give u an example u compare m4 with i4   m4 premium is at 25% vs i4 at 52%,btohqsg
This is local context.Petrol Tax is $0.69/ Litre.If you base on 10yr COE. That is alot of petrol tax returns.There will be carbon tax soon?Now DC charger is $0.45/kWh? Will go up to $0.65 - $0.75/KWH I believe.Unless Singapore goes Nuclear power.Now our power plant are currently waste desalination plant or petrol/diesel generators.,btohqsg
No no nothing do with these   what I mean is car price might never go down already as dealer now need to rely a lot on selling premium as more and more ev,btohqsg
Even coe is lower but the car price will still be very high,btohqsg
On premium cars?How about cheaper BYD. Very affordable,btohqsg
Can drive la this but just not eggciting,btohqsg
Don’t said premium car let said Hyundai,btohqsg
But even the Ioniq 5 is classed under “premium” alr,btohqsg
Like same as EV6 from Kia,btohqsg
Yes they need to as it is the best way to transit,btohqsg
What I mean is the income la haha for dealers   as if less car service or sign package with them their earning drop ma,btohqsg
I think all the dealer and car workshop are facing this issue worldwide,btohqsg
Maybe no more dealer.Direct sale from Manufacturer like Tesla.Earn from manufacturing. Lower cost. Aluminium?,btohqsg
Not easy to remove dealer also haha,btohqsg
They had gone a long way with manufacturers,btohqsg
Only new brand can. Like Tesla and BYD.,btohqsg
We are discussing if price will go down anot haha,btohqsg
Hyundai possible? Since got manufacturing plant in Singapore.Contract up with C&C. Maybe Can exit,btohqsg
Then the ice car leh haha,btohqsg
Slowly die.No More petrol car by 2040?We Could be like Japan. Young working adults don't prefer buying cars.,btohqsg
Ya but when petrol car get lesser and lesser the price should go up ma,btohqsg
Cause scale of sales is very important,btohqsg
It like I am a dealer selling a brand every year in this small sg I got 5 k sales only and need maintain such a nice show room,btohqsg
Then now with ev my sales dropping by 20% year to year,btohqsg
The only way I survive is increase my margin,btohqsg
Actually now if people are educated about the margin,btohqsg
Why would people still get from dealers,btohqsg
I just feel as a whole most are quite shady,btohqsg
Slowly exit lo.Likes the Old Maserati dealer.   He didn't wanna continued with Maserati.He went to sell yacht 😂👍,btohqsg
Especially when their salespeople actually earn thru nonsense like loans and insurance comms,btohqsg
Ya but during this period of time the price should go up ma haha,btohqsg
That just my guessing la   as I notice as price the ev premium to be very high,btohqsg
Price Should  go down very soon.Interest rates up.Fixed deposit rates up,btohqsg
Sometime in buisness u know there is demand and neeed u won’t go down margin 1 haha,btohqsg
Too many variable liao so to me don’t hope coe go down   can price will drop a lot,btohqsg
See how much cash you have loNot enough money. U need to liquidate car stocks.,btohqsg
Go buy toto with all ur savings  with as many permutations as ur savings allow  and hope that one of them strike jackpot,btohqsg
this 4.5k come in Sg will be how much😛😛,btohqsg
Make cars foldable la. Can fold small until like iphone. Then pap cannot justify coe existence,btohqsg
U can fold  make sure don’t unfold it on the road… once it’s on the road  charge u $70k for coe,btohqsg
Maybe next time eletric bicycle a big hit,btohqsg
All don’t need pay for and road tax,btohqsg
I tot got escooter already? But banned la,btohqsg
They mod the escooter until can break 110kph,btohqsg
It’s not safe to go fast..won’t be able to brake safely,btohqsg
With coe so high now why don’t you wait a while? I’m quite sure will fall.,btohqsg
Is Bose really good. It’s standard on Mazda 6 also,btohqsg
bang and olufsen is good used on AMG.,btohqsg
considering renting  now lor so test our choices for a 1month,btohqsg
then if coe drop then buy lor,btohqsg
if you can't beat them  join ithem,btohqsg
Ok. But I can’t tell. I ain’t sound buff,btohqsg

do you guys idle  your car for a long time after cold start?,btohqsg
Usually just wait a while  then drive off slowly,btohqsg
Newer vehicles don't need to 'warm up' (idle after cold start). The new engine designs allow for immediate start and drive off.,btohqsg
i dont wait at all. i just drive off - slowly  till it heats up adequately,btohqsg
If I have time  wait for it to get upto temp (90°)  if not  I wait for the revs to go back down first then drive slowly until engine upto temp,btohqsg
Wait around 30 to 45 sec before moving off  let the engine oil circulate first,btohqsg
you are wasting fuel. and burns more carbons,btohqsg
i on already then rev to 5k rpm,btohqsg
even on the old e30  i dont do this. i drive off immediately,btohqsg
slowly of course in the beginning,btohqsg
a daily car is well lubricated even the next day cold start,btohqsg
Rather waste a bit of fuel than see a big bill in the future because I never take care of the engine,btohqsg
dont think you understand engine internals well,btohqsg
maybe blocked by what you think will damage engine because you need to warm up.,btohqsg
give the engine the cold treatment and it will get stronger and stronger,btohqsg
i NEVER said revv. i say move off SLOWLY,btohqsg
so dont force your words on me,btohqsg
i say the way i do it,btohqsg
whjen you move off slowly you build temperature,btohqsg
but you know how to build temp faster?,btohqsg
if you drive your car daily  even when you stop your engine say the day before  the cam shafts etc are still coated with engine oil the next day you do cold start. as you know wear occurs when engine is cold because oil flows back to the sump,btohqsg
if you revv is too early too fast  you risk destroying engine because the oil aint hot yet. and hence flows slows. this risks oil reaching the important parts,btohqsg
what you said is correct  but for older engines  or V8s V6s  i believe warming up the engine before moving off would be a precautionary measure,btohqsg
nothing wrong w wasting a dollar or 2 if tht helps u sleep at night,btohqsg
then i observed how germans do it. in cold winter freezing temperature  he starts his car and move off immediately  albeit slow.,btohqsg
"one of them drives a Quattro. we might think they dont ""take care"" of engine. but soon  after engine oil heats up  they go balsting on autobahn",btohqsg

its not like they are driving very dangerously or at high speed,btohqsg
bro  no seatbelt + sitting on centre console leh,btohqsg
mehh i think majority of her body still inside of the car ba  but thats my own personal opinion.. nevertheless its still unsafe la and dont reccomend it,btohqsg
For me  it reminds me of this😂,btohqsg
I do every morning. Not so much for warm up but because I smoke then drive off 😂,btohqsg
Legal pax for this vehicle is 2 leh. Imagine fine foreign worker lorry if they carry in excess of pax limit but let this one go…,btohqsg
I don’t smoke leh.. I just get high on other people’s fumes when they sit in carpark waiting for oil temp to rise,btohqsg
Coz the boys ask her to,btohqsg
idk maybe have fun? no way in ur life have u not done anyth stup!d,btohqsg
I have I have. Every exam my report book reminds me,btohqsg
u see those kids doing rollers too  some of them stick half their bodies out without wearing seatbelts.. equally if not more dangerous,btohqsg
dont sit on the gear knob,btohqsg
3 means exceeds by 50% lehhh. Too much too much. Exceed capacity by 10% maybe can. Like add one golden retriever for eg,btohqsg
the only reasoning i can think of... she enjoys sitting on the center console gear knob,btohqsg
When you free come ride in my rickshaw sir 🛺,btohqsg
mazda is enjoyable car i said manytimes,btohqsg
Maybe want to experience the wind in her hair also but the car only 2 seats  so the guy offer the gear knob or his gear knob 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️,btohqsg

then buy the S90 when market falls,btohqsg

Hi hi  does anyone own 2016 Honda vezel here and face issue with head unit Bluetooth paring with iPhone?,btohqsg
I concur. When accident happened  then we all can laugh at their consequences. The usual lame why never put seatbelts yada yada.,btohqsg
Just like that kid who did the shift changing for his dad.,btohqsg
Change headunit. Vezel using aftermarket right?,btohqsg
Nope. Mines is hybrid. Cold start. The engine start to charge the 🔋 around 1 100 rpm. By the time I reached first floor. From 3rd floor MSCP. The cold engine light is gone. First 5 mins I tries not to hit 60km/h.,btohqsg
maybe less worst appealing. generally i dont like audi styling. IMO  not stylish. bad proportions.,btohqsg
Audi is the toyota of germany in terms of styling,btohqsg
I love their new exterior light clusters though. Like very cool leh sir,btohqsg

My car is literally cold all the way  even after running 4 hours non stop  I can touch the motor bay with bare hands. 😭,btohqsg
then how to warm up the battery?,btohqsg
Why u need to warm up battery,btohqsg

I only know I need to warm tire now,btohqsg
Warm engine is like dinosaur to me,btohqsg
But last time I drive in winter,btohqsg
I never warm engine also hahaha,btohqsg
Winter you need to warm yourself,btohqsg
That is for u want to charge faster,btohqsg
what! not for the car to go faster?!,btohqsg
Before reach SC car auto warm battery,btohqsg
Immediately can go top speed after tire warm up.,btohqsg
Pioneer HU? Keep trying. Forget it and repair.,btohqsg
I don’t bother also actually but when I go to places with sc  it will auto warm up the battery for me,btohqsg
Then I see the bbq sign logo,btohqsg
wow this tesla have auto drive and can go top speed even with cold engine and battery?,btohqsg
Cannot lah  top speed must use bare hand to drive,btohqsg

I guess so? Not too sure. Mine is pioneer head unit is stock unit I think,btohqsg
So most of you change head unit for vezel?,btohqsg
"Your user manual will advise if a warming up is required/recommended. Differs between make and model.I know some models do have ""Warm up phase"" with a slightly higher RPM idle initially. Also to warm up the cat too.",btohqsg
Speaking of that  the Fatal BMW M4 freak accident is also the same - The car is a 4 seater but at the time of accident  it sat 5.,btohqsg
Its on and off only lol,btohqsg
There is no off. 😅 it’s permanently on. Ready to detect your remote key. 😅,btohqsg
Good move. Reset to factory default,btohqsg
If confirmed cannot connect  just replace the HU. Don’t bother to waste time. 2016 till now already more than worth it usage.,btohqsg
Put fine also kena censorship 😂,btohqsg
Cause of $$$$ numbers? Ask admin what censorship words they imposed.,btohqsg
Nope  the word “fine” isn’t in our list of banned words😄,btohqsg
which car manuals do that? please show us,btohqsg
which car manuals advise warming up for minutes before moving off?,btohqsg
i have yet to see one,btohqsg
They like to rev up high first. 😅 if it doesn’t means it is already warm up.,btohqsg
Lol… I saw that briefly too,btohqsg
this says exactly what i said. DO NOT warm up by idling engine.,btohqsg
all the car manuals i have had says - move off slowly till engine becomes warm,btohqsg
I think recent Porsche cars also rev up high first before rev idle down below 1k rpm.,btohqsg
"Mistaken your intend of saying ""Which car manual does not advise on warming up car""",btohqsg
I might be wrong  older turbo cars may require idle warming up  then again  i could be wrong on that,btohqsg
all engines do that to raise the rpm slighly because it is cold. mazda  m3  etc. then drops rpm,btohqsg
The principle is to let the fluid heated up to flows,btohqsg
Ermm not all engine. Honda jazz no such thing. 🤣,btohqsg
Mitsubishi Lancer tailgates a car to evade car park fees at Ang Mo KioPretty impressive tailgating skills. Looks like it comes with lots of practice.➡️ React with 😢 if you think the Lancer should receive consequences for his actions!👉🏻 Read the full storyhere!,btohqsg
the raising of rpm is sort of like pulling the choke (carburetors) to richen the mixture to prevent it from stalling,btohqsg
Yea  some cars with digital gauge  the redline of the engine will slowly increase as the car warms up gradually.,btohqsg

otherwise cold start revv too slow the engine sputters,btohqsg
most modern cars don’t really need to warm up but they do recommend that not to rev too sudden during the early stage of car operations,btohqsg
modern cars use cat converter oxyhen sensor to compensate that,btohqsg
my particular model don't have. 50/60 beetle have them. My model as autochoke or something. Just need to step on the accelerator a bit if it is idling too slowly.,btohqsg

I enjoy ppl tail gate lorry,btohqsg
Some match the speed of the trucks at 70kmh on expressways lane 1 when these trucks are at lane 2. Why?,btohqsg
Lol as long as on the left  other drivers shouldn't horn you la,btohqsg
To block u they feel happy,btohqsg
I tried la. 3rd gear  floor. Still can gain speed. Not that bad lol,btohqsg
They dun pay for the petrol lol...,btohqsg
Too many truck drivers dun take extra care,btohqsg
I like to see those ppl drive very aggressive and tail gate ppl,btohqsg
I wonder why they just can’t over take,btohqsg
So all lanes slow down unnecessary.,btohqsg
And then we lame some trucks speeding above 70kmh. The key is they don’t leave enough gaps,btohqsg
I would zoom past or stay out of their blind spot...quite scary cos according to my uncle these drivers either totally can't see the blindspot (otherwise won't call blindspot lol) or they boh hew,btohqsg
They boh hew is one common sign,btohqsg

Robot can take in any insult. The worst is they just stop working and let the higher level deal with the complaints,btohqsg
"was actually want to refer the ""human"" customer service is worst than speaking to a bot. 🤣",btohqsg
Mechanic said throttle body super dirty 😅 so air / fuel screwed up or air flow sensor dirty so cannot detect properly,btohqsg
