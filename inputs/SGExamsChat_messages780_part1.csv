That friend choose to take the math major ones  which is the hardest one,btohqsg
Gotta love the mall under construction,btohqsg
Well that friend thought that... Well nothing bad is going to happen if I took that module by the math department,btohqsg
Oh so cannot use as the core u mean,btohqsg
NTU be like: what is SU?,btohqsg
think they building crl plus new bus int there,btohqsg
wtf i was js there js now,btohqsg
I think calculus is a core for econs major,btohqsg
But you can choose to take that module from the math dept or the econs dept,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ im on the mrt lol,btohqsg
There are people who actually double major in math and econs,btohqsg
they say is gonna open soon  doesn't look like is ready for opening,btohqsg
Its just that the friend of mine took the one offered by the math dept,btohqsg
And got massacred by the module,btohqsg
i alr know a few ppl in my batch double major math & econs,btohqsg
Lmfao  it never does...wait until I army come out still won't be done wanna bet,btohqsg
Crl will be way later than 2030,btohqsg
Its a common double major for math students tbh,btohqsg
I realised physics is also applied english,btohqsg
The explanation qns was killing me in sec sch,btohqsg
tbh itâ€™s common for ppl to take econs with smth else lol,btohqsg
Ah ic so the calculus fr the math dpt turns out to be more chim?,btohqsg
I know one of my friends took stats and econs as well,btohqsg
ntu econs batch only 58% is pure econs and thatâ€™s not counting those with second major in biz,btohqsg
I can get why calculus is a core for econs,btohqsg
The math department also offered game theory,btohqsg
But that game theory is a super duper abstract module,btohqsg
I know math + econs is p common,btohqsg
ntu math even got mods like financial econometrics lol,btohqsg
I cant imagine the game theory in h3,btohqsg
I never took before but from the prerequisites  it is actually more of an OR,btohqsg
Coz my econs intro  game theory just a small bit,btohqsg
bus int has been under upgrading since 2021 iirc,btohqsg
Wdym just sign up through their form,btohqsg
No wonder your profile name is musician,btohqsg
Used to do grading but then i stopped coz i cant do a diploma in that + uni at the same time,btohqsg
But I didn't take any exams like ABRSM before,btohqsg
So I have never experienced what it is like to be graded,btohqsg
Tbh i realised learning in yamaha has higher passing rate then learning in cc,btohqsg
No point taking the exams ngl,btohqsg
Plus there are like way more freedom in learning the things I want to learn,btohqsg
but didn't take exams  cuz i quit,btohqsg
So i did all the way fr cc until g7 (electone counts fr 13 downwards) and i failed g7 twice under cc tutelage  then transferred to yamaha and then managed to seek approval to skip g7 and then passed g6 w 1y crash course,btohqsg
Its way more fun that way,btohqsg
But for me i find the gg for exam pushing me to practice etc,btohqsg
Okay what piece do you want to learn?,btohqsg
And then I go and search for the music that I want to learn,btohqsg
And then she's like... This is difficult for you but I think you can play it,btohqsg
i wna learn piano again  but no motivation,btohqsg
If not  its more of my teacher finding some recommendations for me to learn,btohqsg
