But thanks for the help melvyn and C,btohqsg

Do you have any long outstanding loan that not repay in the past?6. Have you ever abused your bank account? such as borrow your account to other people?or any abnormal transactions appeared on your bank account ?,btohqsg
Hi please advise. I want to deposit on 1st mar. But i have submited this form. Does it mean i have to deposit on 29feb to be qualified?,btohqsg
1 yes2 I work for 3 years3 no4 no5 no6 maribank have contacted me with regards to that and I have explained before that some of it was company expenses,btohqsg
Waa this one ‚Ä¶ I apply also but they never even send a confirmation email. Only say ur participation is being reviewed,btohqsg
can register again in Mar. Btw u got empty account before 30 Dec 10.30pm?,btohqsg
I think this is uob rising dragon savings promotion? Would like to check that I have existing Uniplus account that is maintained with minimal balance as I was too late to know that needs to be emptied by 30 Dec.Can I apply uob one account now and register this new uob one account for this promotion?,btohqsg
It looks very simple and no longer has any emptying account and earmarked criteria? Just put fresh funds and hold it for 4 months to get cashback?,btohqsg
Yes. It is new account. Opened in Jan 2024,btohqsg
It is not confirmation. I think it is the same as what you got.,btohqsg
can. need to put fresh fund in from another bank,btohqsg
Read the TnC on UOB website.,btohqsg
Item 6 explained why your credit card applications were rejected. Not sure why you use your personal account for company expenses. The transaction amount likely exceeds your income a lot and does not match your income. Shall your company use its own account for business transactions?,btohqsg
I realise that a lot of private companies do that lol.The staff will use their personal card or bank account for daily operations then afterwards submit for claim. Then the claim will only come together with salary.Sounds very stupid and sus. Like the company never cater for funds for operations like that.,btohqsg
How about opening an account n leave it there? That‚Äôs what i do. Occasionally when they have really good vouchers for shopee purchases  I‚Äôll use it (as high as 20% cashback in shopee coins  but with a cap). So u will have to do a lil bit of math to see if you earn more from CC or the voucher,btohqsg
The vouchers are shown on Shopee app  with a MariBank logo. So anyone is able to see what kind of vouchers they give out,btohqsg
Thanks. Read thru the tnc of rising dragon promo. It seems it is eligible for newly opened uob savings account this month. That means if I participate with my new uob one account by 29 Feb  I must deposit stipulated amount of funds by 29 Mar  hold it until 17 Jun to be eligible for the cashback? I am sorry. I worry I misinterpreted this promotion,btohqsg
Hi guys my xnap just stopped working.. anybody having the same experience too?,btohqsg
Mine doesnt work with applepay too,btohqsg
You also hor  how har..Anywhere we can email or feedback to har,btohqsg
Side question  do you know how to check your progress after signing up for it? I believe I have satisfied all the requirement but have no way to verify it,btohqsg
Hi all  i am still experiencing issue with xnap. When making payment via apple pay  ‚Äúpayment failed‚Äù error pop out. Anyone encountering the same?,btohqsg
Participate and Deposit fund by 29th Feb and maintain it until it is being earmarked by 29th Mar.,btohqsg
Thank you. I think I will use my Uniplus account for this promo since I have maintained it minimum balance since. The tnc also mentioned this promo cannot concurrently run with other promo such as new opening promo and salary plus promo,btohqsg
Dbs altitude offers 10k miles if we pay annual fees. Which airline can i buy for flights w 10k miles?,btohqsg
I m considering flying to sri lanka,btohqsg
The issue is not on the seed phase but on the confidence of using ledger as a wallet. If the seed is not compromised then there‚Äôs no risk. He just wants to switch wallet and keep his coins intact.,btohqsg
Because if you have UOB EVOL or One card  you can definitely get more than 5% cashback. And you can sometimes add on UOB bank vouchers.,btohqsg
Use Android phone with Google Pay...Since 3 days ago  only 1 person reported working whilst everyone else on Apple Pay said otherwise.You can check withJTto see what he did to get his XNAP to work.Seems like it failed for him too:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/171808,btohqsg
be careful about this  not sure where u see issues with ledger but it might be a scam to get your seed phrase,btohqsg
"Based on articles  the only news I've seen is about the Ledger hack by code exploit. Which happenedtwo monthsago.If your seed phrase or wallet is compromised  you would have noticed it way earlier. And Ledger will also be compensating victims as well.Ledger said to prevent further exploits  they will disable blind signing by Jun 24  which means you can only do clear signing (i.e. sign transactions on dApps only available on Ledger Live).If you're getting DMs or people prompting of such compromising of seed phrase  then you should be wary as it might be a scam. Possibly leaving the group/server altogether  usually happens in badly moderated dApps chat group/servers or those scammy ""signals providing"" chat group/servers.",btohqsg
Time to switch to Android. üôÇ,btohqsg
Of cos not. Android and Apple discussion is forever no ending üòÇ,btohqsg

Yeah I just face this today while making payment,btohqsg
aite thanks  glad its nt my phone issue.,btohqsg
Is this promo subject to the lifetime SCB bonus cashback limit? i.e. those who previously received cashback for SCB promo will not be eligible/have her or his cashback award deducted?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have a question regarding credit card spends. If I hit the cash back caps every month  can I use a different card from the same bank  or should I get a card from a different bank to continue getting cash back?,btohqsg
should maintain using the same credit card as long as you can easily hit the min spend.,btohqsg
does not matter same bank or not. Target to get max cashback for your spending where u can meet min spend easily,btohqsg
Let's say I spend 3K on the card  but I max out the cash back at 2K spend. Should I get another card to use the remaining 1K spend? Same bank or different bank?,btohqsg
yeah you should NOT spend over the maximum cashback limitget a few cashback / miles cards  so you can move your spillover spend to the next best card,btohqsg
Mine still not working. Just tried,btohqsg
Any account which does not require minimum credit card spending and deposit salary yet having decent monthly interest? I have a spare of 100kish cash.. I already have ocbc360 and cannot go for uob one,btohqsg
