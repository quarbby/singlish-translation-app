A friend of mine was smoking and vaping like alternating,btohqsg
Yaoteck are u familiar with the term 3BX,btohqsg
O that's why it felt off,btohqsg
honestly we arent even that far off age wise tbh,btohqsg
20 push up 20situps 20 counts of 8 jumping jacks,btohqsg
When I write papers I just document events that occurred during your time,btohqsg
It's ok my sit ups for ippt 50,btohqsg
i think once we're in uni  a 5ish age gap doesn't mean much,btohqsg
i dont even think im 5 years gap from you if i read your age right,btohqsg
Same in the end for silver for ippt,btohqsg
5bx is pushup  situp  squat  jumping jack and er i,btohqsg
but for my sake we shall keep that in secret,btohqsg
Afterall the first thing I learn was just to be candid to my profs,btohqsg
then once you're working  10 year age gap is wtv lol,btohqsg
like how many times a day,btohqsg
Start from wall pushups then work your way up,btohqsg
in my eyes you still my young ass junior,btohqsg
haha  but wall push up doesnt rlly help,btohqsg
Or can do planks also to build core,btohqsg
Yeah legit what honestly once uni age is literally just a number,btohqsg
Lift some weighs for arm strength,btohqsg
i am a rp SHL student i can help,btohqsg
i mean that's why you see graduating guys or even postgrads dating y1 undergrad,btohqsg
technically speaking  legally isnt a y1 girl still not an adult yet,btohqsg
Exactly lmao it doesn't rlly matter,btohqsg
uhh depends on definition of adult. age of majority? age of consent? minor?,btohqsg
I couldn’t do zero but I never gave up 2 years later I can do 30,btohqsg
Ok ah is it chest to grnd and full extension,btohqsg
okay if we go by consent then yeah 18,btohqsg
Who say u no arm strength,btohqsg
in terms of consent is 16  but to avoid weird shit go 18,btohqsg
ok ah then i give u smt u can do ig,btohqsg
Push’s up is about how you control your butt to remain straight and when you go down and up how you maintain,btohqsg
yea i'm just saying technically but you probs shouldn't lol,btohqsg
try see how many pushup u can do like chest to grnd and full elbow lock,btohqsg
You can try go down first stop then from down you go up,btohqsg
Still feels p weird to be dating a girl just fresh out of jc if youre like postgrad or something,btohqsg
Or you can do girl push ups,btohqsg
But i aint about to judge love,btohqsg
Only issue is with Uni surveys lmao,btohqsg
Do till failure then do knee assisted push ups,btohqsg
I still have to fill in consent forms sign by my parents,btohqsg
im failing my ippt can anyone give tips,btohqsg
yea i gets but it's how they perceive them la. like if you are able to look past the fact that they just got out of jc then sure wtv,btohqsg
I have seen it before tho,btohqsg
idk when you think of them as just out of jc  it's off. you think of them as uni freshie it's less weird,btohqsg
no i left the server then i got banned,btohqsg
Realistically if they really like each other eh,btohqsg
someone who actually scored for ippt??,btohqsg
2.4 is the hardest train that the most,btohqsg
im a good runner but i suck in pushups,btohqsg
My pushup is 54 ah in 60sec,btohqsg
i personally know people that freshie year 1 dated a postdoc/phd (idk which),btohqsg
I mean tbh i just witnessed a y4 scoop up a y1 girl 2 days into ori so i guess ive seen all the weirdness there is,btohqsg
surprisingly none of our friend group really gave a shit,btohqsg
Same I relied on my running 10 min 17 seconds to get silver,btohqsg
Also the brain age matters lmao personally if your thinking is unorthodox it leaves u kinda alone in your age group liao,btohqsg
If you’re skinny need to bulk and train push ups daily,btohqsg
have seen this too and those two are now engaged,btohqsg
i legit starting from 0 again hahahahaha,btohqsg
Stamina is intervals slowly build up,btohqsg
19yo made the moves first so idk,btohqsg
eh true got people in their 20s with the mindset of typical 14 year ols,btohqsg
Sometimes i dont feel my age at all,btohqsg
I think i might actually be a good person to workout with rn if u got nth going on in terms of strength and stamina,btohqsg
"i never do bc i'm like still going on campus like a ""student""",btohqsg
Yeah damn a lot of my year mates still have that JC sheltered mentality,btohqsg
So what you need to work on,btohqsg
i need restart from 0 due to injury,btohqsg
They kena screwed when stars come,btohqsg
my run and sit up okok,btohqsg
Ya then js slowly build up core and arm strength and progress,btohqsg
Like in terms of maturity level  like how i perceive a situation and how i solve problems etc,btohqsg
And when any opportunities I legit had ppl be like no one told me,btohqsg
Minh i got like 2 options tbh,btohqsg
Never ever felt like mature enough to do that,btohqsg
Day by day you will improve,btohqsg
"i think when i fly overseas for conference and have to interact with all the academics as an ""equal""",btohqsg
Of course you cannot be lazy,btohqsg
u want relaxed approach or like the spartan method for increasing pushup,btohqsg
No shame on doing girl first,btohqsg
wah im taking my ippt in like a few weeks from now,btohqsg
U physics always will have some child prodigy who is basically a human intellectual resource,btohqsg
says the one referring to it as girl,btohqsg
yea bruh i'm working with one of them,btohqsg
undergrad but his brain i can't keep up,btohqsg
ya the pe cher say can dabao ippt till hari raya,btohqsg
Find max pushup and do 10-20% of max every hr,btohqsg
Ippt is mental power and discipline,btohqsg
Yeah thats why I left STEM bro I legit cmi with these kinda things,btohqsg
Prefer to just make my own path,btohqsg
I am just using the term my pe teacher said,btohqsg
One is girl push up and the other is the normal one,btohqsg
i mean for me it's motivational la in a way,btohqsg
I struggled with imposter syndrome so much when i first came in wtf,btohqsg
Ok and im telling u thats gendering exercise,btohqsg
Everyone around me just could do it without looking like theyre gonna break down,btohqsg
Ya la I just feel demoralised when that happens ig,btohqsg
yea he's the kind where someone points him at a resource to look at for research and he comes back with a finished product to review,btohqsg
What do you want me to do?,btohqsg
If no shame then just say knee pushup ah,btohqsg
focus on yourself as always. it's difficult but end of the day you go diff paths anyway,btohqsg
btw if you wanna discuss how you study some time closer to finals lmk,btohqsg
yeah took me one whole year and a devastating gpa for that,btohqsg
i dont need stella gpa but i just dont want to feel like im wasting my education here,btohqsg
Its honestly like telling someone if they cannot deadlift above 100kg then they shld do female deadloft,btohqsg
Can I use your office to study?,btohqsg
Remember if you fail Ippt before going army you have to go in earlier,btohqsg
Best of luck yall can do it one,btohqsg
Js a reminder u can always retake ippt,btohqsg
Ya as manag times as you want,btohqsg
Then again for me it's humanities the Prof points me to a resource in closed stacks access before,btohqsg
Ngl had Profs point me to National Archives request for access items before also,btohqsg
i'm at the point where literally everything i try to google points me to research papers,btohqsg
Btw do other poly students look at research papers,btohqsg
I am at a point whereby the papers aren't even digitalised,btohqsg
or they refer to poly slides,btohqsg
huh i doubt their content needs to refer to research papers,btohqsg
Oof i refer to research paper for mine,btohqsg
No need but like Galileos Two New Sciences was written in the 1600s,btohqsg
oh wait you're the guy with that fucked up research assignment,btohqsg
And got different translations and editions,btohqsg
Wait YT your vocation was what,btohqsg
Actually i think there is part of it that the lecturers have higher expectations,btohqsg
You couldn't ask your class meh?,btohqsg
Ok but how was the experience,btohqsg
Then just adapt a bit and your answer,btohqsg
but i saw what my classnates wrote for some rjs,btohqsg
bruh i think some lecturers js have higher expectations,btohqsg
They say cannot but honestly they don't check and it's not collusion if it's just asking em what they did.,btohqsg
It's just collusion if u copied what they did.,btohqsg
My class dl me so yeah,btohqsg
i also realised my rj more detailed than my class and i need put in way more effort for same grade,btohqsg
yo chatgpt 4.0 is actually goated,btohqsg
Got ppl not happy i get A and say im not deserving also,btohqsg
"anytime i do not understand a lecture  i just upload the picture  ""explain to me in a simplified manner""",btohqsg
Really so good for productivity for reports lah,btohqsg
Fk it lah im gonna make mee sua instead,btohqsg
one egg not enough ah sgt,btohqsg
bro they look like a kid came in and adjusted everything,btohqsg
And the adult never bother to double check if everything is in order,btohqsg
Like why got one text suddenly in 0.5 font bruh,btohqsg
ChatGPT crashes when I sent em that,btohqsg
there's quite a few journal research articles that's very clearly AI generated for some parts,btohqsg
Np need work on the lecture slides lol,btohqsg
U can try it yourself lmao,btohqsg
U got see the one where the text is outside the textbox,btohqsg
or got one micro font text somehow,btohqsg
Or the slides content not even fully on the slides,btohqsg
Rp shld learn to fucking release lesson content bef sem starts,btohqsg
Eh do u have the citation,btohqsg
No i mean we dont get access until the lesson starts,btohqsg
i'm procrastinating my research bc my task now is checking through my entire calculation,btohqsg
I wanna pull it up on ex libris,btohqsg
think that one they fixed it alr,btohqsg
Like our pre-reading is not accessible to us until lesson starts,btohqsg
In summary  the management of bilateral iatrogenic I’mvery sorry  but I don’t have access to real-time informa￾tion or patient-specific data  as I am an AI language model.I can provide general information about managing hep￾atic artery  portal vein  and bile duct injuries  but for spe￾cific cases  it is essential to consult with a medical pro￾fessional who has access to the patient’s medical recordsand can provide personalized advice. It is recommended todiscuss the case with a hepatobiliary surgeon or a multi￾disciplinary team experienced in managing complex liverinjuries.,btohqsg
buff build doesn't mean u have rizz,btohqsg
it is not worth my time,btohqsg
Y'all i think i fked up,btohqsg
i asked a girl when's her birthday when im pretty sure she told me bef,btohqsg
and she has my birthday pinned in her chat 💀,btohqsg
it is not gonna affect you,btohqsg
a guy asked me to wish him happy birthday,btohqsg
When u realise udk someones birthday but they have urs pinned to their chat or that,btohqsg
no one should care that much,btohqsg
me n my friend  we just pinned both ways,btohqsg
Gg maybe i had too many toxic exes,btohqsg
bad person to be saying this but dun overthink,btohqsg
i mean if it's your partner that's another matter,btohqsg
but even then it shouldn't be toxic,btohqsg
real  i only rmb close friends birthdays,btohqsg
tbh once you grow older your birthday is just another day in general?,btohqsg
Ah then start from planks and knee pushups then slowly you try normal ones at a comfortable pace,btohqsg
I dont even remember my best friend's birthday 💀💀💀,btohqsg
and you only tend to have memory space for the ones that are really close to you,btohqsg
i think i overthink way more than anyone else,btohqsg
ik the dude for 18-19 years,btohqsg
i just tend to rmb birthdays very easily,btohqsg
earlier this month one of my friends texted me saying,btohqsg
mfw when they put a mid terms on my birthday last year and my friends were complaining about it more than me,btohqsg
first time i forgot in 6 years,btohqsg
ok if the birthday is not soon  it is ok,btohqsg
i guess google calendar is a back up plan xD,btohqsg
ok my excuse is that their birthdays is always during sem 2 recess week,btohqsg
but i don't follow that schedule now,btohqsg
i hv every year asked this person for her birthday  keep mixing up between 30 and 31,btohqsg
technically if i dont go for lectures and tutorials i too work at home >:),btohqsg
but u cant not go tutorials,btohqsg
can if your faculty don't care,btohqsg
not every course has smth like that,btohqsg
[Confession #16]So this is probably one of the oddest things I've done  but I'm a straight female and I helped my male friend shave his butthole and the area surrounding it today haha. Manscaping is great and I hope more guys take care of their private gardens cause a little TLC there can really go a longggg way 👀🍆PS  was really tempted to go all in and lick that puppy or give it a lil poke after shaving but I didn't want to give my friend a heart attack 👅🍑 why do guy's butts have to be so damn cute ❤️,btohqsg
yeah for our faculty our tutorial is basically just going through tutorial ans  no engagement or class part,btohqsg
i tot most courses have tutoral part,btohqsg
and most people are kind enough to take pic of the ans or just wait for prof to upload tut ans so,btohqsg
technically the only day i have to come to school is lab day,btohqsg
and even then you can dont come if you really want to,btohqsg
tutorial have  but not all have tutorials that have marks for you to get that way,btohqsg
so far there hasnt been a phy mod that has a tut class part,btohqsg
my mods were usually homework assignments  midterms  finals,btohqsg
i only know like 5 birthdays 💀💀💀💀,btohqsg
Can't have tutorial participation if you don't have any tutorials,btohqsg
i had it for QM 2 where each student must present answers a few times for max marks,btohqsg
wtf then i confirm fight to go up one,btohqsg
im the king of wrong answers anyway xD,btohqsg
i mean if you at least tried then sure? or just ask a friend,btohqsg
usually people just max out their marks then rest of tutorials don't go,btohqsg
i heard some math mods also like that one,btohqsg
it's just like present 3 times you get the full 10%,btohqsg
my tutorial marks are not participation marks lol,btohqsg
yea our tutorials are almost never graded itself,btohqsg
It always has been another day,btohqsg
we have separate assignments for that,btohqsg
ok but kinda tough for someone like me who dont do tutorial quesions on time,btohqsg
im like always 2 or 3 tutorials lacking behind lmao,btohqsg
only catching up when there's an exam,btohqsg
actually for my econs mod  it used to be tutorial participation but now it seems like they give the 1m for attendance only,btohqsg
man has 7 arms or something,btohqsg
tdy i attended a different lab and the prof went through the lab answers,btohqsg
i'm like the opposite of a model student lol,btohqsg
exactly the kind of student i want to be,btohqsg
man has a thousand and one ccas,btohqsg
thing is it kinda bit me in the butt for my phd,btohqsg
but my normal lab i think the cher dun bother coz 3/4 of the class leave at 11 lmao,btohqsg
bc my familiarity with solving concrete problems isn't as there,btohqsg
but for undergrad itself it worked well,btohqsg
he does you just dk his real name,btohqsg
you just need to dig deeper,btohqsg
What the heck is max out marks lmao,btohqsg
wyatt you gotta do about that,btohqsg
there is a cap on tutorial participation for some courses,btohqsg
So if u don't attend any of the 12 it pulls down the average,btohqsg
not in the eyes of what profs want us to do,btohqsg
For mine is just either 5 or 10%,btohqsg
we're only allocated 10% for class part which is the tutorial stuff,btohqsg
the rest is assignments midterms finals,btohqsg
CSA : In order to score well for my mod  you need to be thinking of my mod every minute. Bathe also think  go home on the mrt also think  in the toilet also think,btohqsg
and the 10% is just presenting 3 times,btohqsg
Yala but tutorial stuff for me is just like actual participation in discussions,btohqsg
i mean physics... what's there to discuss discuss...,btohqsg
For my close friends I alw write down in my calendar but I nvr expect ppl to rmb my bday la,btohqsg
If they do then that's nice if they don't that's all g too,btohqsg
i think of how he gave me a C every min,btohqsg
I only rly rmb the bday for,btohqsg
Idk see this is why yall should extend into metaphysics,btohqsg
Then got a lot to discuss liao,btohqsg
3 ppl off the top of my head 💀,btohqsg
i cant remember who told me this but you can be nice to a person but dun expect being treated the same,btohqsg
Soz boss I don't even rmb if got Ur bday sia,btohqsg
yknow some days i get the epiphany like,btohqsg
Like for me some things I do I just do cuz iw to do it,btohqsg
Eg vday I made cards for my friends,btohqsg
It's just smth small and fun I like to do,btohqsg
They happy I happy alrd brih,btohqsg
Actually when is Ur bday sia..,btohqsg
Can I bring cake to your office?,btohqsg
It doesn't rly feel like anyth anym,btohqsg
yea if always expect a return  then u will just be miserable coz ya,btohqsg
Happy when ppl wish tho for sure,btohqsg
There's diff standards for rs la ah,btohqsg
I'm pretty chill abt alot of things,btohqsg
yea it cant be over-imbalanced too coz that is just not healthy,btohqsg
Usually I find out when I open email to check my inbox,btohqsg
And then some newsletter is like happy birthday,btohqsg
U never give me a lullaby,btohqsg
bruh i actually love how i am saying this lol,btohqsg
bro i hope that ill have the energy to pull through tomorrow,btohqsg
I gonna toh alrd as if I haven't been sleeping from 5-7+ jn,btohqsg
my seniors are camping in sch bruh 💀💀💀💀,btohqsg
there was once i happily er took to harbourfront side coz i was at the 2nd last stop,btohqsg
but luckily manage to catch the last train back in the other direction,btohqsg
I'm gonna pon sch on mon,btohqsg
i set timings to come online,btohqsg
gonna sleep for 15 hours straight and realise i have sch the next day,btohqsg
coz when im trying to do other things  i dun open telegram and leave my phone far far away,btohqsg
My HW is inside Tele also,btohqsg
i just turn off most of my notifs,btohqsg
i do my work while using tele and watching youtube...,btohqsg
wait i have genuine question for yall,btohqsg
told you i'm no model student,btohqsg
how do yall deal with heavy procrastination,btohqsg
I usu on music while studying,btohqsg
Force my ass to do cuz my sense of responsibility is nuts,btohqsg
i make procrastination part of my routine,btohqsg
im actually a very bad person to ask...what did i flooded siyan wirh jn,btohqsg
and integrate it into my studying habit,btohqsg
im the type that will procrastinate everything until 2 days before the test and panic that i have to study 7 weeks worth of topic in 2 days,btohqsg
This is not healthy tho prolly,btohqsg
then it'll take me 12 hours to get through a 15 slides content...,btohqsg
idk for real my finals period i set a topic by topic schedule for all mods then my day is legit just,btohqsg
i tot my 6h was bad enough,btohqsg
11am to 4am sit at my desk and study,btohqsg
but not like just hardcore study,btohqsg
Walao what the heck is dis,btohqsg
idk i just found a weird way that worked for me,btohqsg
it's like i insert intermediate breaks throughout my entire studying,btohqsg
i feel like im only productive when my brain knows im truly fked and if i dont start now i might as well dabao the mod,btohqsg
meaning i really don't take any breaks longer than 10 mins ever,btohqsg
i can eat in <5 mins,btohqsg
i hv been hving wandering thoughts while studying,btohqsg
I am productive if I am drugged up,btohqsg
ya even then im not 100% onto studying,btohqsg
i see one youtube video on my recommended,btohqsg
Usually like a lot of caffeine and stimulants,btohqsg
next thing i know 3 hours have past and im still on the same week 2 lecture out of week 7,btohqsg
anyway at this point im telling myself it is just 1.5mths to graduation,btohqsg
lol one of these days we should meet then you study while i work,btohqsg
maybe you'll see what i mean,btohqsg
there is no point giving up at this very moment,btohqsg
good chance you'll think i'm just slacking with youtube,btohqsg
you'll actually see what i mean too,btohqsg
ok but now for phd bc it's legit weekly updates to my prof,btohqsg
i have a more streamlined schedule,btohqsg
so siyan is actually working with youtube,btohqsg
i still work with youtube on tho,btohqsg
why is this chat at its peak at 12mn,btohqsg
thats why im coming to you for advice on how to actually study lmao,btohqsg
I just procrastinate with wendover videos,btohqsg
but i guess i wanna try forcing myself to change now first ig,btohqsg
it is not too late  there is still 1.5mths to final week,btohqsg
if i need stuff on my comp i split screen youtube and the other thing lmao,btohqsg
thats what i mean by procrastinating,btohqsg
i mean it helps to develop an interest in figuring it out,btohqsg
but it's hard to do that when you're in panic mode,btohqsg
eh i certainly cant get anything into my head if i do that,btohqsg
[Confession#C1780]How do you young adults deal w their strict n protective sgrean parents?Despite being of legal age like 22 yrs old  my parents still kept pestering me about my whereabouts when its 11pm+. Letting them know in advance / what i am doing still doesnt satisfy them as they claim they are worried and doesnt like it when their children is out late.But they dun understand the whole concept of spending time w ur friends late at night talking cock and js bonding.Should i even listen to them or js live my life and let them be angry cause honestly  i dun think what i am doing is wrong,btohqsg
in panic mode you just wanna not fail,btohqsg
siyan's experience w me in just 2 days,btohqsg
Who here have strict parents can relate,btohqsg
but i've actually never panicked over an exam ever before,btohqsg
Sometimes I hit a word block tho,btohqsg
hard to develop an interest for physics  im just a survivor in this course tbh,btohqsg
Like they don’t allow this don’t allow that,btohqsg
but i get what you mean,btohqsg
and to do that i probably need to start earlier,btohqsg
so i'm able to still sorta be chill and enjoy the figuring it out in a time crunch,btohqsg
now seems like a good time i guess  week 10,btohqsg
