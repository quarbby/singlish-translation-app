Hi Ben  I think you watched too much Robert Kiyosaki‚Äôs videos üòÖ My view - If you think the US financial markets are one of the most influential  liquid and well regulated in the world today  then USD should remain sound  although it‚Äôs influence will be diluted due to the emerging economies‚Äô importance.,btohqsg
Hey  Bobby. I have no idea who is that Robert guy  but you have a point there. However  you mentioned influential. If influence is a factor  and more countries adopting the Yuan for trade and subsequently for other matters as well  won‚Äôt it then lose it value?,btohqsg
Surely with BRICs using Yuan to trade will somehow cause the USD to weaken  no? Sorry  Bobby but I am pretty new to this. Just want to understand a little bit more.,btohqsg
Considering the fact that Yuan has gain more influential in recent years. üëÜ,btohqsg
As of today  many public and privately traded equity  goods  commodities  global trade and gold  Bitcoin  etc are in USD. It will take quite a while before the influence is eroded. BRIC and company are beginning to form their own bloc to trade. The question ‚Äúwho is the customer‚Äôs customer‚Äù comes to mind. Half the World consumers (including HNWIs) are still Europe/US. I know it‚Äôs a difficult situation to analyse but human being human  there is still no alternative to the US financial system‚Äôs integrity at the moment‚Ä¶ my own view. Btw  I don‚Äôt agree with how the US run their balance sheet but trade currency influence vs country balance sheet are separate matters for discussion. Sorry for the long response  hope it helps .,btohqsg
Yes  it helps. Thank you  Bobby! Was concerned about it when I wanted to throw money into the stock market. Anyhow  in your view  will it also be an opportune time to invest into the stock market?,btohqsg
Anyone able to advice if I plan to go europe buy branded bag or watch  what credit card best? Maybe cost around SGD 15k,btohqsg
hello what's the interest rate for HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
Maybe a general spend miles card would be the safe option. DBS Altitude offers 2mpd for overseas spend.,btohqsg
apart from the bonus interest what's the usual one,btohqsg
Time in the market>timing the market,btohqsg
Google it my friend  HSBC website has the information you are looking for,btohqsg
Agree  depending on your knowledge  budget and goals. Everyone has different circumstances  like what Chris mentioned in his videos üëçüèª,btohqsg

If opening joint account and only one name is new to bank  is that eligible for the 5% promo,btohqsg
I bet many Europeans thought the same about their currencies too when they were the world leader,btohqsg

It definitely is long term effect. As new challenger [China] comes.,btohqsg
Many might be old enough here to remember USD: SGD was 1:2 not that long ago,btohqsg
