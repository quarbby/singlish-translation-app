U R asking for too much my guy,btohqsg
And ej tj and dh use the same set of notes,btohqsg
So the only option I have left is hci,btohqsg
No hci is questionable cause they,btohqsg
Eh what?? I tot TM notes q good sia,btohqsg
The content is at least in the notes,btohqsg
I just disagree with the way that it's taught,btohqsg
Because to me the way irs phrased its fking stupid,btohqsg
Ya did u mix up  maybe h1 dh then ej teach extra,btohqsg
No it's in the syllabus document,btohqsg
It's he compare w sylla doc,btohqsg
Plus I asked the other geog cher,btohqsg
Wait send the message ur cher sent,btohqsg
I think this aspect not fully addresed yet but in next or next next weeks HBL we will give this set and upload the lectureThanks for being so sharp hehe,btohqsg
Chao ni ma eh H1 not supp to have HBL stuff HAHAHAAHA,btohqsg
I low-key scared of her also,btohqsg
I not in the mood to deal w her shit,btohqsg
Brw there's alot of studf in ur notes not in syllabus anymore,btohqsg
Like the Urban as an entity and quality,btohqsg
And the reasons and variations for global trends in urbanization,btohqsg
NO WONDER I NVR FEEL LIKE IT GET TESTED ONE,btohqsg
Idk why they focus on reasons,btohqsg
The syllabus document asked for effects...,btohqsg
If u see ur syllabus document  the second big point is smth likePopulation challenges faced by cities in achieving SD- High urbanization rates and urban speawl- declining urban populations,btohqsg
How do they affect the pursuit of countries in achieving SUD,btohqsg
Dude at this pt u can create your own notes and sell it LOL,btohqsg
So u must link to the idea of needs limits and trade offs,btohqsg
It's not rly in the notes from ur sch,btohqsg
Feels like this got covered in the notes,btohqsg
Cuz ur sch focus mainly on the reasons why got these trends,btohqsg
But challenges placed on the dimensions due to population pressures is not,btohqsg
And this one can come out as essay qn,btohqsg
Cuz the issues in sud are all manifestations of the imbalance between demand and supply,btohqsg
Ya I alrd can think of the points roughly,btohqsg
SO u can just link everything to issues in sud,btohqsg
Time to be an asshole and kinda gatekeep this info,btohqsg
Yea btr pray no other tmjcians see this esp not within a public chat,btohqsg
And take h1 geog this yr,btohqsg
I raised this all up to the geog department head in ej,btohqsg
if u can oni choose one,btohqsg
"""Actually it's quite badly written la""",btohqsg
"""So i tell my students to ignore LOL""",btohqsg
He talking abt the ej notes,btohqsg
Tbf this is cause he got beef with the geog cher who wrote this portion of the notes,btohqsg
"i rmb in poly there was a presentation on ""ways to reduce waste in singapore""..my bright mind gave the suggestion  make floating garbage trucks so that waste can be collected and driven over to semakau and dumped and did not need to wait for a barge to travel from semakau and mainland on a time interval...quickening the turnover rate of garbage...Not realising that this does not reduce waste  just quicken waste removal",btohqsg
Tbf this always happens when there's a new syllabus,btohqsg
Damn funny eh me and my friend we're just like,btohqsg
Do yall think singapore will ever implement these trucks for garbage removal,btohqsg
cause to get trash from mainland to semakau..they need to wait to feel up these,btohqsg
the real question is: is bedok counted?,btohqsg
