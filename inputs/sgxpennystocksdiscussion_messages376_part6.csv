Wah Cement getting more and more tempting to enter... shall wait longer still quite risky  break 54 means bad news ahead.,btohqsg
Some may view this chart as a triple bottom or double bottom or is set to break even lower.My view is that the chart presents a triple bottom at the moment. The triple bottom chart pattern is a rare  but extremely effective reversal pattern. Itâ€™s rare since the successive creation of three equal lows doesnâ€™t happen quite often. Therefore  the double bottom is a more frequent chart pattern as it requires one low less to happen.On the other hand  its scarcity makes it a very strong and powerful pattern. The sellers are extremely exhausted after three consecutive attempts to break lower  which makes them exposed to a rally as buyers feel much more confident after defending strong horizontal support.The triple bottom formation doesnâ€™t have any apparent weaknesses. Actually  its biggest limitation is that it doesn't occur quite often  otherwise it would be the strongest reversal pattern out there.That said  watch out whether it can rebound from 0.054 decisvely.- Charles.,btohqsg
Got international cement group one... amazing,btohqsg
Thanks for chart.. Looks quite good,btohqsg
Charles kor kor doing his homework everyday.. I sarpork him.. I know the feeling is bad when stock goes south,btohqsg
I already black green on this counter. Today I bought some at 0.054. Hope is the lowest. Not going to average down even it goes under. Avoid holding & opportunity costs. Concentrate on other shares.,btohqsg
I suppose it's overvalue. That's y chart behave in this way,btohqsg
When too much repetition for a counterItâ€™s plain koyokMedtecs of the past,btohqsg
Else cannot be 7 series drift till 6..till 5,btohqsg
Like minded people all holding hands and pray together,btohqsg
Read all paper hands to shreds,btohqsg
I Dun see propnex union gas drift till like this,btohqsg
Ya lor. Seems overvalued now but then the prospects seem ok cos 1H likely record highest cement sales in volume de. Have to see how also. Haven't enter  just going to watch first.,btohqsg
The chart depicting triple bottomNot sure how rareSeems quite commonBefore a triangle breakdown,btohqsg
U all referring to cement or propnex?,btohqsg
The chart placed perfectly before the revival from 2 cent upwards.Though unlikely to revisit but never say neverCost is dirt cheapA hard ramp to 10 cent regionThe drift could be lengthy and painful,btohqsg
Some say overvalued.. Some say growth stock.. Justified the current price,btohqsg
Below cloud still. Like got more room to trim,btohqsg
Ya agreed! The drift before the rise or down can be lengthy and painful. Just feeling very mixed about this stock. Feel like I might miss something also leh,btohqsg
Ya... HAHA I read this everywhere.,btohqsg
Ya this cloud also another issue. Then hor  whether BB follows it is another thing...,btohqsg
I don't advise ppl to buy cement now ba as there is alot of opportunity cost involve.. The next reporting is on August.. In between they can play dirty and whack it down to 3-4 series region,btohqsg
Unless u got holding power else really no point to buy ba,btohqsg
