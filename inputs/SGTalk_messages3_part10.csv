No lah year cohorts going to be all on CPF Life already  no more choice,btohqsg
How come our government dont wanna clarify this misunderstanding earlier? Even Ho Ching is under the wrong impression lor.,btohqsg
If government really reduce them  then lesser tax collected. This is the hard truth.,btohqsg
My view  I dont think is misunderstanding  I think they intentionally leave it grey  after all they have the track record of keeping many things grey and secret from the citizens  we no need to know and no need to think.,btohqsg
I do not have the stats how much tax is contributed by foreigners so....,btohqsg
Who know where to find void deck cobbler at amk ?,btohqsg
Tin Pei Ling no POFMA meh? For saying 23k??,btohqsg

So guys I'm not sure if it's true. But I heard like foreign workers who work in companies w medical benefits get full coverage to private hospital facilities. Even my NTUCincome preferred income shield also don't cover that much ü•∫,btohqsg
This is why i dun understand why pple wan to be mp...got money cannot spend...got power need to be humble..walk on the street let pple scold. And still they continue,btohqsg
They want to be the MP for the ridiculous high salary while pretending to care about people,btohqsg
It's true what. Why when the hospital they go to is reported in the news it's always Raffles Hospital? But then the problem is send to private doctor get short MC  go govt doctor then get proper  long MChttps://www.todayonline.com/singapore/doctors-seek-clearer-rules-mcs-foreign-workers,btohqsg
Ok liddat I also want become foreign worker ah HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA second class citizens so sad ü•∫,btohqsg
If all go govt hospital wouldnt the queue be even longer? Why need to overwhelm the public hospital just to prove a point?,btohqsg
Because the bosses got agreement with the private doctors to avoid giving long MC to affect the incident KPI. Work injury resulting in hopitalisation of more than 24 hours or more than 3 days MC  consecutive or not  must report to MOM. Give light duty instead of MC is the easiest way to siamThis doctor working at Raffles Hospital gave 2 day MC and 1 month light duty when the standard is 2 week MC. One week later worker got pain  go CGH get 2 weeks. Doctor at Raffles followup after that give 2 months. Total after CGH is 9 weekshttps://www.todayonline.com/singapore/landmark-ruling-against-doctor-ngos-say-inadequate-mcs-migrant-workers-still-problem,btohqsg
Lolz u one year sick how many times sia...hospital ur 2nd home?,btohqsg
Oh ya hor....it will affect their billboard right? Those displayin how many days without incident thing,btohqsg
So ur saying the bosses worked with pte hospital docs to give light duty as much as possible?,btohqsg
I think best is dun be so sick lah,btohqsg
Sick too long your boss sure ask u to walk home one,btohqsg
Haha so opposition not aiming for the money? Or u say they will donate all?,btohqsg
Not sure bout the $$$$ but I do noe that when I watch the parliaments live debates at least they r active not like a lot of pap ministers where they just agree with constituents,btohqsg
Being of the ‚ÄúY‚Äù gen I hope that at least our 4G ministers choose to make a difference since they have been running for elections but it seems like all they do is sit back n shake LEg n collect $$$ from our tax,btohqsg
I know of a lot of ppl that say things like Tan Cheng bock is alrdy so old n y does he still wanna run for office? Is it coz of $$$$ ? At his age he should b enjoying his golden years ...... I think the more impt qn to me is WHY did the parliament change the rules for the presidency election  when they noe that he wanna contest for it? Is there sth they wanna hide?,btohqsg
Oh yea. That remind me. Did we ask Dr Tan why he wan to run for presidency in the first place?,btohqsg
I think he must have felt that the Govt have some short comings so after 26 years with then decided to quit and set up his own shop,btohqsg
Then the question is does he need 26 years to find out?,btohqsg
I thought would be easier to ask him compare to the gov. Gov got standard answers liao,btohqsg
Or maybe he was asked to step down due to party renewal so good chance to set upOwn shop,btohqsg
One of the things he said when he open psp is that pap lost it way along the time,btohqsg
I think he mentioned it many times on YouTube.Personally  I think  at his age  from his residence  and him being a previous pap mp  he would had had earned quite a modest sum of money. Hence  I think it is not for the money and more of his passion,btohqsg
But i think he didnt say that when he ran presidency,btohqsg
I think most pap mp will give that description.,btohqsg
U guys not tired abt the salary part ah? Lolz,btohqsg
Cos few tens of thousands is common to them,btohqsg
Its also getting bit boring le,btohqsg
Dude.. Go watch the videos. Google youtube PSP. I think it is best if you do your own research. That is the best way to learn.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs teh opposition always say this one mah,btohqsg
Actually no leh...opposition dun harp on this le,btohqsg
They harp more on...should mp be full time or part time,btohqsg
Always is CPF  HDB expensive  no pension for old pple   minister make a lot  !7 makeSo little,btohqsg
Depends on which party.Different party focus on different things.,btohqsg
Yah but always this few issues lor,btohqsg
To be fair   PAP is not perfect and opposition quality really getting better,btohqsg
Lolz. I dun see a fair in ur sentence,btohqsg
If they do.  They need to be ready to form gov leh,btohqsg
They should form a division regardless of which oppies to collect people's feedback and then organize them to voice out in parliament,btohqsg
Document those feedback from people. Help those in need in the process,btohqsg
Can collect feedback via social media too.,btohqsg
