every day is competition for us,btohqsg
If you're smart enough to cheat then can. Don't be like my classmates  wanna cheat but go tell the whole class it's a secret lmao,btohqsg
Not saying u are bad ...Just that your strength may not be reflected in the A level path,btohqsg
Work on your strength and choose a path suitable to bring out the strengths.,btohqsg
i not fnb how I take,btohqsg
I want to take CHS in NUS in like a few years,btohqsg
but idk which path to go,btohqsg
If u good at stats in h1 math. Then it a sure pass ah.Trust me. :),btohqsg
rn im on the a level path,btohqsg
Cambridge is 2 years. But singapore based exam is unknown,btohqsg
Even in chs u should know the career u want,btohqsg
If u want to pursue a career more inclined towards academic and research  alevels might just be better.,btohqsg
But if you want to get real life experience  Poly might be better,btohqsg
If u want both then its#whyMI4 u,btohqsg
Unforunately singapore emphasise on critical thinking,btohqsg
Only when things get critical  we think.,btohqsg
That isnt a career. That is a subject you want to do,btohqsg
oops i saw it as degree,btohqsg
i want to be an elit teacher,btohqsg
and i had a lot of people telling me to go A level route,btohqsg
It is relatively easier to go to NIE via alevel route than poly.,btohqsg
But it is possible via poly route too if ure willing to grind for it.,btohqsg
But if u r willing to grind  why not stick to what ure doing right now and see it through. Get good enough score and open up more possibilities,btohqsg
i don't have enough confidence and strength in myself to get through..well... this year,btohqsg
god my mindset has to change,btohqsg
Y1 is super hard if ure not used to micromanaging urself and peers.,btohqsg
but if u can clear it  it gets easier,btohqsg
Hmmm I have poly friends who transferred and enjoyed it but some who regretted going to poly. The ones who thrive are those who transferred bc they have sth specific they like but if the problem is you dk what you want then it's better to toil thru As,btohqsg
For As I think a mindset u can take is  yes  consistency is impt but its the end (As) that matters,btohqsg
So even if you're struggling now it's the exam at the end that rly matters and if ur in MI you have three years to make sure it's gd,btohqsg
Idek if it's possible via the poly route,btohqsg
