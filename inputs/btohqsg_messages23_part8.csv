Hello! Are we able to apply for multiple BTO projects during the launch?If yes  if we get multiple queue numbers  when do we have to drop the choices?,btohqsg
Everything can be found online. U may google first.,btohqsg
One location  one room type only for example Woodlands 4-room,btohqsg
why is engaging a contractor more expensive than an id??,btohqsg
I agree! This screenshot may help although the writer wrote way back in 2009. Recently I went to ask for quotations from several contractors and IDs. Unfortunately for my case  1 contractor quoted me more because of the workmanship. Eventually go for ID cos quotation was few k difference. So yes it all depends. Furthermore now inflation must think of labour too.,btohqsg
Hi would like to ask  my boyfriend and I will be applying for the MCPS for the upcoming BTO project in June  but how does it work? Is there a form that we need to apply beforehand?,btohqsg
Nope it’s an option you select during your flat application.When you are called for flat selection  they will send you an application package for you to fill up and sign  it will contain a document called Undertaking of MCPS which the MCPS parents’ have to sign before you go down for the flat selection.,btohqsg
So this means it’s during the balloting period or after?,btohqsg
It’s when you apply for a sales launch,btohqsg
I see alright thank you! 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Hi guys is there a grp for June 2024 launch?,btohqsg

25/26 June? Usually bto launches r on Tues / wed?,btohqsg
Hi everyone! Wanted to ask if anybody knows  if a block has a mixture of 2 rooms - 4 rooms  would that mean it'll be like: 2 rooms starting from the lowest floors then 4 rooms on top? Or how'd usually the blocks would be split?,btohqsg
Each stack (ie all levels have the same unit number) will have the same room type.Each block has multiple stacks  so some stacks will be 2 room  some 3 room  some 4 roomEdit: this isn't true for every project  see Tampines Green jade (aug 2021),btohqsg
This doc  they'll only release later on or at the time when we're bidding?,btohqsg

14 projects in upcoming possibly 2024 October BTOgovernment save all projects beside MRT for the PLUS scheme (10 years MOP)Pasir RisMattarBayshoreKembanganBukit Batok,btohqsg
"also  i'm hesitating to conclude that all of the upcoming sites in this post will be in oct 2024. notice that HDB never committed anywhere that all of them will be in oct 2024. they only mentioned that the next launch will be in oct 2024  but didn't say that all of these sites will be included in this launch.which is why i carefully worded this as ""upcoming bto projects earliestto be launched in oct 2024"". also cos i think it's v sus to launch so many at one go.but we'll see!",btohqsg
haha np! i found it very interesting when i first saw it. which is why this info stuck with me all these years hahaha,btohqsg
How can I see the individual price range of units?,btohqsg
https://t.me/btotampinesaug2021/16353greenjade brochure  for your convenience :P,btohqsg
yeah  for example the strangedec 2023 bto selection start monthsthat we witnessed not too long ago. that's why i always reiterate that past patterns don't necessarily foretell future events. HDB has a knack of wording things carefully to buy themselves space to change things later,btohqsg
Hello! If there was a mistake in the application after submitted  can I cancel my application to reapply again?,btohqsg
Actually count the number of unitsWe will know whether all will be launched in Oct 20242024- 19 600 targetFeb - 4000 + 1700 SBFJun - 6800October - 8800 units or 7000 units (if SBF is part of 19k launch),btohqsg
Shag I guess I need to wait for the Oct launch .,btohqsg
Cause those area all far from my in laws place,btohqsg
Out of 14 projects7 projects 400 units onlyOnly 3 k unitsSo many small projects in October 2024,btohqsg
14 projects  total units 854043073071034069042018403603102707605508402902024- target to launch 19600Feb - 4000 + 1700 SBFJun - 6800October - 8800 units or 7000 units (if SBF is part of 19k launch),btohqsg
Hdb need to launch all projects to hit the 19600 target set for 2024,btohqsg
this is a really good point. thanks for calculating!and the 19.6k is BTO only  as articulated in thispress release. so yep  even more so they need to launch all of the above projs in oct 2024  you're right,btohqsg
Check the message by SM above yours! The link is right there,btohqsg
Will only be available to people who get a successful ballot q number,btohqsg
How to check how many applicant for bto?,btohqsg
But meanwhile  here’s a reminder to everyone to read up theGeneral Conditions for purchase of a flat under Jun 2024 sales launch.Seems like this is a new document for bto launches… But useful info esp if you dont want to burn your $10  mess up your chances and end up losing your 1st timer status.The pdf can be found in the message SM sent earlier today,btohqsg
