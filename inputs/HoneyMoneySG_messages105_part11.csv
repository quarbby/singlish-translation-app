Please read up my previous post regarding stash with earmark  it is 3 plus 1.66  effectivr 4.66 to just maintain fund without all the hoop to jump like salary credit/spending etc. All other high saving have this criteria and hsbc ega is only one month with incremental. If u pump in on last day of the register month  it is akeen to 4 month of fd at 4.66 so i dont see why it is not good,btohqsg
Furthermore infact if u know how to play the uob system u can even dont lose out on the interest for depositing it on last day of the month of registration,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt calculate until so far. Thanks for the update.I‚Äôm also stuck in the Stash. ü§£ but lucky expiring 17th for $100k lock-in  will withdraw everything on 1st June.Thanks again! üòÅ,btohqsg
Ya just withdraw and keep clean for jun with min 1k inside,btohqsg
I have always zero my accounts. Why keep min $1k?,btohqsg
Fall under fee  uob have the right to deduct if u fall under the minimum mab,btohqsg
I thought there will be a charge fee for below the minimum balance,btohqsg
Ah. Never been charged with that before.Although I have been charged (-$5) multiple times from HSBC Personal account. üòÇ,btohqsg
They said will deduct $20 but have never done that.,btohqsg
5 per charge.. that‚Äôs a quite a bit for charge below fee üôÉüôÉ,btohqsg
Every month when they caught you having more than $5 balance. If less than $5 then no deduction.Small price to pay for EGA.,btohqsg
Can upgrade to be HSBC premier if u don‚Äôt want to have charge below fee  monthly just deposit $15K in and fast out 5 transaction on 1st of each month will do,btohqsg
