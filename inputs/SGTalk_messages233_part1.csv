Macs need to stop exploiting the stupidity of people,btohqsg
How about people stop being stupid to be exploited?,btohqsg
If you can't educate them  fleece them.,btohqsg
I don’t understand the rave ngl I mean there’s better pikachu items than macs pikachu carrier,btohqsg

i remembered I was young when i came across a Persian kitten and 2 ragdoll kittens all are strays btw,btohqsg
I felt quite bewildered how these kind of breeds are strays uk,btohqsg
so I brought them home HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
they were in a box with the words saying “unwanted cats can’t take care of them hope whoever takes them in can do so“,btohqsg
