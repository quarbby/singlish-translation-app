I use uob one for utilites  transport+ telecoms. Can easily hit 500 a month with these 3 cats and stop at 500. The rest of the expenses i use ladies  crmc  uob ppv.,btohqsg
It mentioned in the website that one needs to hit 50k spending before they can waive the fee... I only intend to spend atmost 25k a year for sol..,btohqsg
you can withdraw anytime (end of each month) without penalty. You even get your accrued interest!,btohqsg
How about citi / Maybank cards ?,btohqsg
I think not many people here will spend more than $50k per year using Lady solitaire card because the max rewards is $2k per month. $25k per year is reasonable.,btohqsg
Many of Citi cards exclude travel. Maybe Citi premier miles but not worth it. About Maybank  I'm not sure bout their offerings. Others can comment.,btohqsg
maybe carousell but incur 4.5% fees. Can see if u have other vouchers to buy via heymax instead?,btohqsg
Thanks for the info! Appreciate it! ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg

Isit just need to maintain 50k within the saving accounts  will do ? Any other form of withdrawal wonâ€™t affect it?,btohqsg
