ðŸŽ‰Pika World Daily Review â€“ 21 October 2022ðŸŽ‰ðŸ’£Bond yields adding pressureðŸ§¸The stock markets continue declining for the second day as investors plough into the latest earnings and economic data.We see the giving up of weekly gains after investors put some cash to work during the early week  hoping for a brightening economic and earnings outlook. And indeed  they did get what they wished for  just not in the right framework.With around 2/3 of the S&P 500 companies reporting their results and the majority beating estimates  the fear of a recession seems not loud noise. Yet  a higher interest rate will likely damage earnings soon while curbing inflation.ðŸ’ŽEconomic data remains resilientðŸ—½The latest jobless claims fuel the call for an aggressive rate hike. We saw fewer jobless claims  which stood at 214 000  a remarkable fall from 226 000 last week. This hints at a robust labour market that is a recipe for continued elevated inflation  thus giving incentive for the Fed to continue its monetary tightening stance.While existing home sales fell to 4.81 million from 4.8 million in the prior month  the figure was still better than expected. Hence  the data shows strength and is sufficient to boost bond yield.The 10-year Treasury yield is now at a high of 4.225% as investors baked in more hikes in the upcoming meeting.Pika World will monitor the stresses of the inverted yield curve as the shorter treasury yield  such as the 2-year  rises swiftly.ðŸ’¸Snap: Yeah  a snap off momentumðŸ•¹Shares of the social media company fell by a quarter in the after-hours trading as the company announced a weak outlook on its fourth-quarter revenue. Unfortunately  there arenâ€™t any formal forecasts for the 4Q  and this is a distress to investors.There is collateral damage across tech giants like Meta  which might portray softer advertising spending. Despite the board approving a $500 million share purchase  investors are buying the transformation narrative of the company.Unless there is a re-acceleration and a broad diversification of its revenue growth  investors will be staying sideline till the sky is blue once again.It is 21 October  Friday  at 8.45 am in Singapore and 8.45 pm in New York. It is the last trading day of the week  and Pika World wishes all friends a truly enchanting weekend. So take a break and sip tea!,btohqsg
