Annualised 1H is 19 cent eps. Single digit PE based on last done,btohqsg
Thanks good to get ur input,btohqsg
I think med stocks under alot of pressure from vaccine news,btohqsg
I anticipate a MT spike to lead other medical along but likely a dead meow. Trade or trim. Not add and think reversal is hereJust my 1 cent,btohqsg
I know. Last yr we had cny dinner at ritz calton ü§£,btohqsg
any comments on this asian healthcare?i saw that it had some healthcare acquisition collaboration with temaseknow the price drop close to the previous support of 18cents alr... profitable company that's at lelong price now... any comments?,btohqsg
not bad not bad... i not familiar with the vicplas people... i think contractors will be more familiar with them ba,btohqsg
Hence my optimistic bold assumptionPiping business breakevenAlso cant derive supernormal profits for the company,btohqsg
if they dont have the pvc pipe biz... current price still feel justifiable... but i think their pvc pipe will pull them down for this FY,btohqsg
Never thought to have any stop loss when you places this trade bro?Really important in trading to set stops.We were rally for a possible breakout when price at the $0.24/$0.245 level if the $0.235 can hold. But unfortunately it broke and cut most $0.22 .Still keep 50 lots for long term holdings.Long term should be okay IMO.Believe the players still in and medical / Gloves and there should some more upcoming play.When that happens  This will bring up the sentiments for other medical counters like this one,btohqsg
i guess it's time to buy the dip then,btohqsg
Anyone please advise if got Medtecs chat group? Pl add me thanks,btohqsg
U are right on the loss of the pipeline business so far we only know VP cut down production and mins labour so the net operating cost will be lower compared to past . Maybe is breakeven from their medical segment or maybe higher not sure perhaps coming week result will have better view,btohqsg
As at now we only know secure 7 project,btohqsg
Its not just about less profit. U need to check their nominal operating expenses. Even cut by half  that is a loss or cost to the company with only est 20-30% of the revenue. Only the coming QR can tell as todate there is nothing to be reference with.,btohqsg
I seeing at the net profit is only,btohqsg
Hi  please add me to Medtecs chat group too.,btohqsg
It may mins of 20% to 30% upcoming qr we all have better view,btohqsg
Of the operating cost for pipeline,btohqsg
so results expected to be so so only,btohqsg
U mean breakeven on pipingYa I assumed so. Which is very much unlikely.Factor in gov funding perhaps. Only proves how big a hole that‚Äôs coming soon,btohqsg
Yes CoZ they are not end sellers. Market price surge benefit them indirectly,btohqsg
breakdown for vicplas is given on page 111 for FY2019,btohqsg
Many ppls were stucked with Medtecs & Vicplas. I'll share my view on these then. Vicplas basically follow Medtecs as you can see from the similar pattern. Everyone knows that Medtecs is on the downtrend. But down until when & where? Let me tell you!!!.........I also don't know!... Lol. My guess is this. Medtecs has started to form a Falling Wedge pattern. This is a good pattern. As the two lines get closer to each other(or near apex)  then the chance of reversal will be on the way. I think the candles body got to close the gap. There's buying zone around 94.5-100. So probably price may drift there. High is 198. So if drop 50% will be around 99. Therefore I think when price come to around 99  there should be many buyers. My English no good so hopefully you all understand. To conclude  I believe a reversal or a good rebound will come after it hit around 99. MACD histogram currently show no positive sign. Just watch out for a positive histogram. MACD Histogram start to turn up means coming liao. Dyodd hah.,btohqsg
Piping $17 329k vs Med $29 836K.Net profit margin is around 7.7% (no insight as VP do not have detailed breakdown per segment).Operating expense also no insight. Let use same % as revenue: $7 350k = pipe $2 720k vs med $4 630k.Operating loss cannot be removed  even cut manpower assume 50% operating cost still = -$1 360k.With only 30% of revenue and 50% opex  u need to cover that cost from the covid business profit. Only then  it will be MORE profitable than last quarter result.,btohqsg
assumption is that medical device revenue increase 50%... margin increased 10% due to covid increased demand,btohqsg
piping assume no loss no gain... remove from equation,btohqsg
Tot someone mention add 80 headcount to medical just nowClearly I didn‚Äôt read ah heng posts on Vicplas,btohqsg
profits wont double... by right share price wont double,btohqsg
Yes. More headcount boost revenue. But whether profitable is another question.,btohqsg
There is no track record to compare.,btohqsg
Also  their FR don‚Äôt break down different sector‚Äôs expenses. So its too speculative.,btohqsg
I thought Medtec went this way üò¢,btohqsg
Thanks for the charts and great explanation üëç,btohqsg
Let our brain rest. Result out next week. Who correct who wrong doesn‚Äôt matter. Winning the trade is the key.,btohqsg
so vp falling wedge till roughly wat px ?,btohqsg
Ya as we here to share informationüòÅ,btohqsg
wait until they ÂºÄÁâå lo... for now we are all speculating,btohqsg
wud be interesting to see how both vp and mt perform on mon,btohqsg
On MT - can we deduce that based on the charts given  $1 is the major support and hence  major reversal for MT?,btohqsg
break up or down important cross road,btohqsg
Too much fear being spread around in sj are telegram groups,btohqsg
Ppl probably be fomo near $2,btohqsg
MT replied not aware of any reason for price movement in SGX query....at least will calm some nerves as no negative surprises,btohqsg
Exact same qn and reply on 13 july,btohqsg
Mt dun even bother to draft a better reply lol,btohqsg
hope MT rebound. though i don‚Äôt have Vicplas.....it will improve general sentiment for all medical stocks,btohqsg
