Why would one even drive a car he is not familiar with fast? I see so many bluesg fellas drive so aggressively on the roads it is just waiting for trouble to happen. And it has. Repeatedly. So they probably deserve the repair bills.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry.  I‚Äôm already there in poverty ü•¥,btohqsg
Maybe share your sgcm listing here sir.,btohqsg
Actually if not your fault  this excess would be from opposite party  that's why insurance company always say dun admit any fault,btohqsg
What if it‚Äôs really your fault?,btohqsg
Ok la higher excess means cheaper insurance,btohqsg
That's what we're supposed to avoid and the high excess to deter,btohqsg

When private-hire vehicles operate like taxis  they should not bid for passenger car COEsPRIVATE-hire vehicles (PHVs) have eclipsed taxis as Singapore‚Äôs leading type of point-to-point commercial transport. It is time their owners are excluded from the bidding pool for Certificates of Entitlement (COEs).When they first arrived in Singapore  PHV platforms were a way for vehicle owners to generate income on the side ‚Äì a real estate agent offering a ride between viewings  a musician with an afternoon to kill before a night-time gig  a salesperson with a slow day.Most Singapore residents still relied on taxis for point-to-point coverage  as there were not enough PHV drivers to fulfil everyone‚Äôs needs.These days  however  PHV drivers are much more likely to be doing so for a living. More than a decade since the debut of ride-hailing here  the industry has evolved to a point at which chauffeured PHVs and taxis are more alike than dissimilar.PHVs also dominate the point-to-point market. There were 79 921 such PHVs registered as at November  up from just 16 396 in 2013.The figure includes chauffeured cars on ride-hailing platforms  as well as self-driven cars on sharing platforms such as GetGo or BlueSG.Meanwhile  the taxi population has fallen to 13 662 ‚Äì around half of the 2013 figure.Despite this dominance  PHVs are still treated much like regular passenger cars in that their owners are required to bid in the open market for a COE from either Category A  B or E.In contrast  taxi companies do not bid for COEs. Taxis are instead registered with Category E COEs priced at the prevailing quota premium of the Category A three-month average.The number of COEs available to the taxi operators is determined by demand  but capped at an annual growth rate of 2 per cent.Birds of a featherThis differentiated approach to PHVs and taxis made sense in the past. Taxis used to have a minimum daily mileage requirement  for instance.This was scrapped in 2016  and both PHV and taxi drivers are free to choose their working hours.Requirements for taxi drivers also used to be more stringent. Today  both types of drivers are required to have a vocational licence  with the same basic eligibility requirements ‚Äì being at least 30 years old and Singaporean  and having a valid driving licence.There are still some regulatory differences that would appear to favour taxi drivers. For instance  a taxi driver can drive a PHV but not vice versa.Also  a taxi can take street hails but a PHV cannot; and a regular passenger car can be converted to a PHV  but not into a taxi.These are minor  though  and make little practical difference. Some might argue that a PHV doubles up as a personal vehicle  and should therefore be treated as one. Yet  taxi drivers have long used their taxis as personal vehicles too.A major attraction of PHVs to taxi drivers ‚Äì and one reason why some have switched over ‚Äì is that the PHV looks very much like a personal vehicle  having only to bear a small sticker.As more taxi drivers switch over to PHV platforms  the business models of the two segments are converging.Almost all taxis are rented from cab companies by their drivers. The PHV market used to be made up mostly of individuals who owned their own cars  but that is changing.There is no authoritative data on how many PHVs are privately owned  but a senior manager at a major car rental company estimates around 60 per cent of PHVs are leased from car rental companies.Even the taxi companies ‚Äì including SMRT and ComfortDelGro ‚Äì offer PHV rentals.,btohqsg
History repeatedA new COE category for PHVs  or removing them from bidding for passenger car COEs at the very least  seems a natural evolution of the market  especially when considered against a historical backdrop.In 2012  the Land Transport Authority removed taxis from the COE bidding process. Before the change  taxi operators had to bid for COEs in Category A.Then-transport minister Lui Tuck Yew acknowledged taxis had been taking up a larger proportion of COEs  with some evidence this was affecting premiums. COE prices in 2012 ranged from S$50 000 to S$80 000 for Category A ‚Äì a level that was seen at the time as prohibitively high for individuals.COE prices have hit similarly prohibitive levels over the past year. They have come down slightly of late  but are probably artificially inflated by commercial elements.Rental companies tout PHVs as a route to car ownership. Renting ‚Äì with the option to own the vehicle after an extended leasing contract ‚Äì offers a loophole to get around car loan limitations that require a 30 to 40 per cent downpayment.A separate COE category for PHVs would properly recognise their status as cars with a commercial purpose.The government has countered that PHV demand is unlikely to be the main driver of COE prices. Yet  removing this source of demand ‚Äì even if it is not the main source ‚Äì would still relieve some pressure on the passenger car COE market.The idea of using a privately owned car to offer transport services is almost 100 years old. Privately owned taxis  known as yellow tops  were introduced to Singapore in 1933.Since the 1970s  however  the government has issued taxi licences only to entities. From around 3 800 in the 1960s  the number of yellow tops has dwindled to 25 as at November.In time  the privately owned PHV may be just as rare. We shouldn‚Äôt have to wait till that happens to adjust the COE system and account for the market‚Äôs evolution.,btohqsg
thanks..i agree mostly with this article. I also personally believe PHVs are a large part of the reason why COEs are so high..people overbid for COEs because they treat owning the car as a business expense and just amortise their future earnings to cover the cost which is not what happens with normal private ownership. PHVs also clog up the roads much more than privately owned vehicles  on average. I think treating them like taxis  which in most cases is basically what they are  is fair,btohqsg
i think there was another article some time back where govt was proposing imposing separate cat for company owned PHV and continuing to allow private owned PHV to bid for normal COEs. I think this is a reasonable compromise,btohqsg
ü§£ log in to nlb app  can read full from there all newspapers,btohqsg
More like subject to same categories as taxis  but I still think they should either change or remove 30%/40% dp,btohqsg
If coe can keep continue to help to avoid / reduce jams in the morning   I do not mind the existence of COE. But if it can‚Äôt   better remove COE .,btohqsg
Cos for phv  passengers are paying for it,btohqsg
As long as it doesn't drive coe up,btohqsg
Still jam leh even when we control car population,btohqsg
