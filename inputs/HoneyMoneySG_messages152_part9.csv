February is still good to put $150k into Uob one. Only March must empty if u want to play potential plunging chicken in April.If your Uob overflow then do HSBC EGA Loh.,btohqsg
So weirdHuman A with exclusive interest for January got less than expected. (It‚Äôs actually automatic extension of marathon but they called it exclusive)Human B with marathon bonus for December got more than expected.,btohqsg
I worry about the security of chocolate visa debit card n if chocolate finance can handle such losses if targeted. Nowadays many online fraud due to brute force attacks.,btohqsg

Freeze the card when not in use.,btohqsg

For those who need a refresher on HeyMax  video herehttps://youtu.be/nnw9ayUQS8Y,btohqsg
hello! not sure if this question has been asked before but just wanted to gather some feedback on Trust banks new investing options. Is it worth to put around 1.5k into their Income+ Option which has a dividend target of 6.5% pa. Or is it better off just putting that money elsewhere? Thank you in advance !,btohqsg
Tbh  I saw the 1.7% fund management fee and said nope,btohqsg
How come the cimb website no longer mention about the bonus interest on fresh funds for fastsaver and starsaver?,btohqsg
Hi. Preety new with crmc here. Does anyone know setting crmc as default payment for SPaybill will grant you 10x citypoints?,btohqsg
Hi gurus regards to Instarem + Citi rewards card. Suddenly my points got ‚Äústuck‚Äù my Citi billing month is 15. And Instarem refreshes every first day of the month . Could that cause the issue?,btohqsg
hiiii wna ask if the HSBC EGA is still good/worth applying for?,btohqsg
What do you mean by stuck?,btohqsg
I'd say yes. It offers unique features.,btohqsg
So I almost spent $1k but is still not reflecting. And pending only those 2,btohqsg
Does your  Citi rewards card and Instarem has different due dates?,btohqsg
not really sure what u mean. If u round down each posted eligible transaction to the nearest dollar then multiply by 10  does it matches the 8690 points?,btohqsg
nope is 993  if i round down,btohqsg
then again. the points earned and spending is about 100$ diff,btohqsg
depends? if you think 2.68 - 2.98% is good then proceed  imo  i don‚Äôt need to think about spenidng money to hit higher interest.,btohqsg
Ask citi chat cso if any transactions are not eligible.If you are only using amaze  check mcc in instarem app,btohqsg
if can hold inside for 3 mths for the extra 0.6% bonus it‚Äôll be 3.58% right? based on my understanding,btohqsg
oh i haven‚Äôt reach to that point because i kept withdrawing outi haven‚Äôt had my 1 month yet haha,btohqsg
Btw  I want to highlight this month SSB is 2.98%  which is the highest in the time interests are spiraling down.,btohqsg
but this one lock for 3 years right?,btohqsg
hmmm i thought whatever it is spents on instarem would convert to online spend?,btohqsg
It's not locked. You can redeem ur SSB anytime  capital guaranteed. Interests are almost 99.99% guaranteed (by SG gov).More info on SSB (and Tbils)https://youtu.be/KySLEgLYqR0,btohqsg
Citi rewards gives 10x points as long as not in excluded mcc (travel and the usual exclusions for credit cards),btohqsg
can i double check if a bank is SDIC insured up till $100k  is it applicable to the entire bank or each bank acc?for eg if have $100k in UOB one and $100k in UOB stash acc  is the total $200k insured? or only $100k,btohqsg
Oh so like grab transport no no?,btohqsg
Grab can. Travel is like klook  Agoda  dining at restaurants in hotel  etc will be excluded.I saw some transaction looks like Fullerton health screening and it may be excluded too if hospital mcc,btohqsg
Best check with Citi cso and see which transactions don't count for you,btohqsg
I see ok cool üëçüèªThanks man!,btohqsg
Then check the mcc code if any is excluded,btohqsg
Btw is your due date for both Instarem and Citi rewards the same?,btohqsg
Instarem is calendar month while my citi rewards is on 5th üòÅ,btohqsg
no such thing as due date for Instarem Amaze. Will just start incur 1% fee if spend over 1000 locally in calendar monthfor citi rewards card 9x bonus points capped at 9000 in statement month,btohqsg
