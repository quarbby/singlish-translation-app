but the pc and cpu is at her house,btohqsg
I gave her/him this this this,btohqsg
the most intresting part is that its just a friend,btohqsg
but now he got blocked...so she no longer consider him a friend,btohqsg
the cherry on top is  he saw her father and the father was super kind to him,btohqsg
because they had a plan to transport it without her parents knowing...but something went amiss and the father was right there waiting at home,btohqsg
He also went with another friend to deliver the pc,btohqsg
because the father would think she got a bf,btohqsg
which the father did...hence why he got some free food,btohqsg
if not then dont give pc,btohqsg
