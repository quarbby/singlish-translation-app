Or u may check w the BTO group did anyone same launch face the same issue?,btohqsg
I posted already. So far nobody have same issue,btohqsg
Hopefully its system glitch or human error,btohqsg
Maybe TMR U call hdb and ask.,btohqsg
Yes that's the only way. Wanted to go down HDB but don't know can allow walk in.,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think they entertain walk in enquiries. Best to write in or call them at 18008663066,btohqsg

Hi! If I apply under MCPS (first timer) and I managed to get queue number  how do I know if I got the queue number via MCPS priority scheme or first timer public scheme?,btohqsg
doesnt matter how u got it because mcps just give you extra ballot  so no difference ba,btohqsg
means normal ballot is 1  first timer +1 ballot  mcps +1 ballot.u total got 3 ballot chances with mcps,btohqsg
but if u apply with mcps and got queue number  u'll be categorised under mcps alr (correct me if im wrong anyone),btohqsg
If your queue number was due to mcps then you will be categorised under it. Youâ€™ll only know when you receive the application package and see the Undertaking of MCPS form which the parents need to sign.,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  you will ballot under the pool of mcps first  then if you didn't get  you will ballot under the pool of first timer (no priority scheme).,btohqsg
I see I see  I get it now! Thanks,btohqsg
Btw do note that they will give you the best outcome.,btohqsg
I was wondering just now if I get my number due to the first timer public scheme  will I still be categorised under mcps . But you answered my question!,btohqsg
Like the one that have the best queue number? Okok,btohqsg
When will I receive application package?,btohqsg
Is it before the first appointment?,btohqsg
2 weeks before your selection date,btohqsg
