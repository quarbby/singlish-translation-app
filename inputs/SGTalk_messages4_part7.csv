Maybe this policy is a bit aged... come to think of it since this is a knowledge workers economy..... all should be be equal contribution,btohqsg
I think last time was to improve the employability of older age workers,btohqsg
Yes  I think they should revamped this portion. Since singapore is facing age population..,btohqsg
Now the retirement age is in the 60s... good time to review the whole thing,btohqsg
You logincpf.gov.sgdon‚Äôt have your name? You can‚Äôt pay your children school fees w CPF? You can‚Äôt pay your housing loan w CPF? You go hospital you can‚Äôt use medisave from CPF?,btohqsg
CPF isn't really a straight forward thingy. Yes  we use it to buy flat  pay for med expenses  so & such  but we may never get it in hand. That bulk of cash accumulated over the years. Look at how the retirement age kept on extending endlessly til we dun even know when we'll be able to 'use it in our way'. I could be wrong in this but that's how i learnt through other ppl's explanations ü§î,btohqsg
The answer is rather simple .... special account is for your annuity and Medisave is for your medical,btohqsg
The Govt wun want to have all these as a burden hence this forced savings,btohqsg
Well maybe they will relax it one day to say if u can show certain assets in your bank and u sign away any request to Govt to support u if u run out of money,btohqsg
They willGive u all/more of the CPF at age 55,btohqsg
Your money all put in CPF?,btohqsg
Employees and Employer CPF portion inside CPF. Why?,btohqsg
Can you take out and use?You ask the elderly  how many can use medisave during hospital visit. Go and do ground check. Don't just talk name on paper.Housing loan using CPF  u pay how long? Stupid. After HDB lease over  is still not ur house. Stupid. Pay to wall or throw to sea?,btohqsg
Wow  used ‚Äòstupid‚Äô your so great then talk to yourself,btohqsg
Honestly i don‚Äôt even need CPF  monthly income is good enough for me,btohqsg
All under your name on paper. In the end  is it yours? Just a paper and name can scam you already. Simple minded.,btohqsg
20% into CPF  80% put where? 80% used to eat? Gamble? Go holidays?20% CPF if for you to save  buy house  your hospitalization expenses and retirement.   Interest in CPF is so much higher. Up to 6%.Bank interest is 0.01%.  I rather have some in CPF and some in bank.Many 55yo take CPF and then spent of China Dollies. Within a few months  sleep on the streets because kenna kick out by wives. Then how,btohqsg
Good for you  pray hard your monthly income is forever.,btohqsg
If 80% also not enough for you to spend  what is 20% üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Looking for it for years ... if anyone have I‚Äôm willing to pay for it. Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
And it goes back to your CPF for the next house,btohqsg
OkLah I think maybe the board should look at individual cases and allow pple to borrow from CPF for someShort term usage depending on the individual ability to repay and purpose etc,btohqsg
This accrued interest thing keeps coming up,btohqsg
Aiyah. Why talk so much about CPF. Cash is king. üòè,btohqsg
