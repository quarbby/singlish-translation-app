Hey guys just started Lalamove. Can I check with you all how come for my cash orders they deduct $2.24 each?,btohqsg
They will take 16% from every order,btohqsg
That one is cashjob.youalready took the cash then they minus 16 percent from your e wallet,btohqsg
Don't mean to sound dumb. So if the order was to be $15 there will be 16% taken away no matter if its a cash or e wallet?So there should be a deduction of $2.40 (16%). So i will be getting $12.60 cash if not e wallet?,btohqsg
