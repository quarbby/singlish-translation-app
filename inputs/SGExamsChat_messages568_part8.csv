cb gna be the first hcl student to get f9 for normal chinese o level ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
ya lorh..this one tao jia huan jia,btohqsg
i know a few fellas that got 1.5,btohqsg
there is someone in my diploma with a gpa below 1,btohqsg
there was 2 in my diploma last sem,btohqsg
if your gpa cannot by laoban dou hua,btohqsg
the one classmate that had a 1.04 gpa has her graduation scheduled in may 2026,btohqsg
cb later i talk so much my last sem fly,btohqsg
i hard carried my imp group for 1 sem,btohqsg
cuz those dogs dw to do work,btohqsg
because of that module i never get 4,btohqsg
i forgot you got wisp next sem,btohqsg
is modules can go to hell,btohqsg
There is a saying for people that unfortunately come rp..dont do more than you are suppose to,btohqsg
dont be geh kiang and do all the slides or ppt,btohqsg
its the break point for determining whether you get a D or A,btohqsg
when you need to maintain gpa  you don't have choice bro,btohqsg
my poly you do that..you gone case,btohqsg
rp trash their own instituition lmao...others dont have to do it,btohqsg
my friend got 3.9 in rp grading system,btohqsg
i cannot fathom how he do it,btohqsg
how do you even get 2,btohqsg
i got 1.81  If my overall grade across 5 modules Was D..it would be 1.5,btohqsg
time for you to grind your butts off,btohqsg
got it I find one day go thr look,btohqsg
all my project im the leader so i dont have that issue,btohqsg
had a classmate that was also the leader..until the date of interview  everybody did not even do their part,btohqsg
in the end she just decided to do her part and leave the rest to fend for themselves,btohqsg
she got A  the other 4 members got D,btohqsg
doesnt mean youre the leader means you know how to delegate tasks,btohqsg
she alr told everybody their roles but the other 4 did not do their portion..so she just told the teacher in the end that she did her part while the other 4 slacked,btohqsg
telling is diff from managing the team well you can be a great student but may not be good with handling slackers,btohqsg
i mean the slackers mia'ed on her..she also cant do much,btohqsg
told them off n they got scared,btohqsg
actually because precisely of what i mentioned earlier..all 4 of the other members predicted the faci was not going to give them a E for not doing anything..since she does not look like the type that would want to write lenghty reports for the failure of a studentThey were right so my friend was literally left in the dark of their plan,btohqsg
"the only thing i was blessed is 2 of them were ok  the other 2 i just show the project  straight up said ""dont give me bs that udk how to do because the other 2 dk they do their own research"" then i just say lor you dont want A just let me know  i dont mind not including you",btohqsg
that is one downside to the grading system in rp..because of the lenghty report situation...many faci's try their best to never fail students..the only way you would tentalively fail is honestly for attendance,btohqsg
because attendance is regulated...grades are not,btohqsg
then they diam lor and do shit work  i told them off and said if they want  they take over leadership  then cuz no one want to lead then they no choice to do lor,btohqsg
people iâ€™ve worked with fortunately care enough about their gpa to at least take instruction from me if they cmi bc i was recognised as the one to follow,btohqsg
"ours we dk if peer eval is impt so i just say ""if you dont want to do the work  let me know  we wont include you and youll get your A  but dont come and fuck up our project""",btohqsg
iâ€™ve never had peer evaluation within a group in uni,btohqsg
ours got the evaluation section of who did what  n the submission need explain ma so q obvious who did work,btohqsg
during one of my graded assignments..when we had to explain some components we did...we realised like 3 of them were not done by any of us,btohqsg
then my friend did some digging and realise her acc was hacked into,btohqsg
and the hackers...may have added those components inside,btohqsg
Am I the only one who think that I'm getting worse as the years go by?,btohqsg
Anyone else experiencing the same thoughts?,btohqsg
my braincells go in a rollercoaster ride,btohqsg
js me or poly likes to add random bullshit to make poly not like a sch but a shitting around play zone,btohqsg
