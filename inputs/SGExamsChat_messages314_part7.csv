my submitted coursework was an article about twitch emotes,btohqsg
i think now only HL L&L got coursework,btohqsg

IA was for econs  sciences  math and a few others,btohqsg
yeah the terminology abit wack LOL,btohqsg
the only skill i really took away was how to bullshit,btohqsg
because you write so much that at some point you have to start bullshitting your way through to finish the essay,btohqsg
tok  ee  langlit  IAs all can,btohqsg

Hi   I’m interested in cjc but everyone on Reddit seems to hate the sci department there … anyone from cj in here who had a good experience and good RP (80+)  .. could you share your thoughts.,btohqsg
bc a lot of people who I’m talking to or even the Reddit posts say jpjc sci > cjc sci,btohqsg
Yes still can but if u got an offer this yr then you need to call sch to double check,btohqsg
u want extra terrestrial also have@imindomie,btohqsg

u can be the next guy to go mars,btohqsg
@IcedMilomeow mi don't nid mtl right,btohqsg

Cuz my kohai  didn't turn up for mtl cuz mc,btohqsg
Then dk if can go mi,btohqsg
Pretty sure its a requirement for all jcs/mi,btohqsg
If you never sit for the paper,btohqsg
Do they just count it as f9,btohqsg
Hmm...maybe im misinformed  but yeah as rachel said  no harm calling the school,btohqsg
So if they just count it as f9,btohqsg
They will just make him/her take basic mt,btohqsg
imagine if someone sick and vr their chinese,btohqsg
take clb like a funny joke ah,btohqsg
Stats wise  each batch has 10-20% of students scoring >80rp with majority of them coming from the arts stream. Do note that proportion of science students is significantly higher at least 4-5x as compared to the proportion of arts students,btohqsg
As much as we like to hate on cj  its also the students' fault for not prioritising their studies first,btohqsg
Right so in ur opinion does cj live up to its reputation as in all the Reddit posts or is it better than that ? Esp it’s sci department.,btohqsg
So what do they prioritise? Hm,btohqsg
