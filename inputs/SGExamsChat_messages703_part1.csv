I don't rly rmb shit from history anym,btohqsg
Why sec 5s generally tend to lack behind is because of the attitude the teacher has towards thwm like the teachers also teach very half assed so what for the students want to pay attention,btohqsg
yea one of my friend alr got A for his d and T..come sec 5  practically just use phone during that period,btohqsg
And also not believing that the students can do well,btohqsg
The other person ik who did the sec 5 to JC thing,btohqsg
This is why u take geog,btohqsg
According to Josh yt failed a levels,btohqsg
Majorly its this. And it sucks ah like my senior she is hardworking but her teachers dw to teach so end up she had to dae,btohqsg
atmosphes drives creativity and passion..if there is none  then expect ppl to not do well,btohqsg
Gauge on what subjects I absolutely hate,btohqsg
Wah I hated physics in o levels,btohqsg
And luckily she got in i was so happy for her,btohqsg
alot of my peers..do dae during the mid year and just use those results,btohqsg
I realised if I go do that subj for As,btohqsg
Express ppl take things for granted alw,btohqsg
I feel like I only rly realise when I talk to yall,btohqsg
Speaking from experience i was in one of the worst pure science class,btohqsg
Never doing tht ever again in my next lifetime.,btohqsg
there some teachers that keep the motivation high across streams but when there are changes..you def can tell,btohqsg
they were so nonchalant. English is v impt esp since the syllabus was tweaked abit then nobody bothered. But when their results were unsatisfactory they kept complaining,btohqsg
hey but on the bright side  last batch of possible sec 5's are sec 3 now,btohqsg
no leh. thereâ€™s still sec 5,btohqsg
Wait even for new system meh,btohqsg
aint it changed to everybody staying in sec school for max 4 yrs if you dont retain,btohqsg
students who take g1/g2 subjects in sec 4 can take g3 in sec 5,btohqsg
And alot of ppl were so rude to our teachers and classmates. I absolutely despised the clowns eh they were so noisy and distracting even when ppl complained the teachers did nothing,btohqsg
Like the ppl inside the class ah,btohqsg
4 years and take the SEC but they have the option of staying one more year to take higher level stuff,btohqsg
like if they wanna go JC or smth,btohqsg
Sec 4 i was mugging alot and was more reserved than sec 3 then omd there wld be ppl screaming in the classroom,btohqsg
basically comparing SEC to O and N levels is like,btohqsg
from what i can see is just more freedom in the subjects you can mix,btohqsg
Among the 3 pure science class my class was the rowdiest and most uncooperative one it was rlly shag everyday,btohqsg
My class more JC class than my actual JC class,btohqsg
end of the day sg runs on meritocracy,btohqsg
No class spirit at all. Everyone was quite selfish,btohqsg
can't expect sg to adopt the american mindset,btohqsg
Anything that is not math and sciences no one will care abt,btohqsg
Like no matter whr u go this will be the case,btohqsg
But if u show the same behaviour during math and science lessons then ngl ur abit fked,btohqsg
Tbf there's always people who just study better without chers (me),btohqsg
Ngl when I taught I just focused on students who cared,btohqsg
Not students who were gd at the subject,btohqsg
yep  they changed it to a graded intern for my batch and likely subsequent batches,btohqsg
"my father always say ""the govt cant just ""relax""  they have to wayang to show the ppl they are doing something""",btohqsg
I only needed 77.5 rp to go nus geog why try to get 90,btohqsg
like the mental health probs sg having now  a very good solution would be building another mental hospital or mental training facility..but nope  they are going to go through all these therapies/self help avenues instead,btohqsg
Ngl I feel like thsts why I didn't die after leaving most of my qns blank in a levels,btohqsg
My physics teacher started helping me out too when i actually started to listen and do work,btohqsg
I just set extremely low standards for myself,btohqsg
