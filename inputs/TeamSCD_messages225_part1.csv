hi guyss! just a quick question for those who knows about coding errors. I encountered one coding error when checking my car yesterday at a workshop.Error code was DTC 3539 - the boost pressure deviates from the specific value.It‚Äôs something new to my mechanic man as well and cant seem to correct that error. I checked online and most of it comes to no avail. Online also no solutions,btohqsg

I‚Äôve been hit by 3 taxi/phv already in this lifetime üòÇ,btohqsg
In all 3 cases i am quite sure i would have died if i was a rider. Hence no 2b for me,btohqsg

Taxi and phv dont care abt how often u drive,btohqsg
They can even catch u just outside ur house,btohqsg
A phv did an illegal u turn without signalling or checking mirror- while i am on his right,btohqsg
U mean if u are the renter?,btohqsg
If u are not at fault  either way u pay nothing,btohqsg
If u are  then just know rental insurance is as good as no insurance,btohqsg
it will help but still higher than u think,btohqsg
some rental cars dont even have their dashcam,btohqsg
I wouldnt accept to drive such tbh,btohqsg
there is no case scenario where renting is cheaper than a car in the long run,btohqsg
but what about loss of income?,btohqsg
or if they deem you are at fault?,btohqsg
or they repair more than damaged?,btohqsg
The person not at fault gets to claim the other,btohqsg
there is no such thing as full protection in renting,btohqsg
If the vehicle is the source of income,btohqsg
