Dunno what big thing happening tml...,btohqsg
I go make one Credit Suisse account and join this group,btohqsg
Busy person. Do homework for tmr,btohqsg
His two heavy calls are aspen and JT ma,btohqsg
Don't ask this kind of qns la,btohqsg
You don't feel comfortable just cut la,btohqsg
Jt from profit to loss. Sigh,btohqsg
John also don't play JT one,btohqsg
He say foreign house buying at 0.088 mah....no wonder,btohqsg
It‚Äôs weird that we are being redirect to aviation when it‚Äôs going to take another 1-2 years to fully recovered,btohqsg
So medtecs got chance ? lol,btohqsg
For which counter? Good or bad?,btohqsg
JT? Does this mean retailers sell off and BBs pick up?,btohqsg
Ya and it means still got bb on jt!,btohqsg
Buy volume so high meaning got hope to push up?,btohqsg
I think is BB short first  then drop liao they buy back! ü§î,btohqsg
So retailers sell because they know based on mt experience that good results will mean selldown. But if bb still hang around  that‚Äôs good!,btohqsg
Yes...that is what happened yesterday...classic BB push to 12,btohqsg
I doubt anyone of us here sold when results came out,btohqsg
I mean I sold on Tuesday la,btohqsg
They work hand in hand. Party A sell 10 million to party B . Then they collect back 20 million shares .,btohqsg
Since work hand in hand . Party A to party B no loss,btohqsg
Sounds right...Bb just need to trigger a bit  then retailers panic and then sell down....possible?,btohqsg
There are many who buy cheap,btohqsg
Even at today closing price still profit,btohqsg
They want force retailer to sell,btohqsg
They also triggered to sell down mah,btohqsg
Will bb repeat same trick tmr?,btohqsg
They triggered 10 million . Buy back 20 or 30 millions,btohqsg
I remembered someone said that uob bought at 11x...,btohqsg
Think of different scenarios and how to react accordingly,btohqsg
Yes and no . JT got good results ... if they repeat will retailers scare off,btohqsg
Tomorrow 9am all will know the answer,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt sleep.. counting down to 9am tmr,btohqsg
Now autopsy is good. Set plan but stillUnverifiable.Best guessAlways good to start from something but be open to different perspective. Repeating same thing to ownself long enough will become truth,btohqsg
He say short selling together to suppress price,btohqsg
Haha... we are trying to outsmart Bbs üòÅ,btohqsg
Fake sell order and secretly collect at bottom,btohqsg
MT is most classic examples . How it was pushed down and then push up,btohqsg
And buy in at 88 for jt.. so 88 is kinda support then?,btohqsg
Julius is legit bo? Sound dubious. Lol,btohqsg
MT I think got at least 3 major push downs . $0.21 to $0.14. Then $0.89 to $0.57. Then $1.98 to $1.60. JT experience one today,btohqsg
Read with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
But wat he say make sense,btohqsg
Short sell together to suppress price,btohqsg
I am only asking because many people call for him,btohqsg
This is 2nd time for JT,btohqsg
If not I won't bother asking lol,btohqsg
Go for facts. Verifiable or sensible ones,btohqsg
First time never push down so many pips,btohqsg
