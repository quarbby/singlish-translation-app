Chem is not pre-req for Chem Eng I think,btohqsg
Which means  why even make chem compulsory?,btohqsg

While it is not pre-req for most courses  it helps one to bridge to either of the other two,btohqsg

Hi  i‚Äôm Ginger.I was found roaming the streets at a new territory for close to 2 weeks ‚òπÔ∏è The vet said I‚Äôm very young  approx. 1 year old! I have a good demeanour - I don‚Äôt scratch or bite humans  animals or even furnitures. In fact  I get along well with other cats  but my 4 other house mates doesn‚Äôt seem too happy with my existence. I‚Äôm very proud to say that I am also litter-trained ü§©I am a full ginger  with really beautiful and long tail and ear. My ear tip is so nicely cut that my temporary mum thought I wasn‚Äôt neutered yet and she stupidly brought me to the vet and to her horror  I was already neutered and so  she STARVED ME FOR NOTHING. Also  at the vet  I am tested for Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukaemia Virus (FELV) and proud to say that it‚Äôs NEGATIVE üòåPlease  now  I am looking for a forever home and an owner that would love and care for me for the rest of my life. May I never roam the streets again üôèüèªIf you‚Äôre interested  please send me a DM or contact me at90297582ü•∞,btohqsg
