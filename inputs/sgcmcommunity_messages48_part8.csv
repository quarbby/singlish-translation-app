Are F1 cars automatic? Yes  but not fully automatic. Instead they employ semi-automatic transmissions. These transmissions have a total of 8 gears and the driver shifts up and down via paddle shifters- J,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not ok. We must explain fully,btohqsg
Brunch is breakfast or lunch? Debate forever,btohqsg
That‚Äôs right. Semi auto is also auto,btohqsg
So based on Pete logic. When I buy my  semi detached my house is considered attached even tho the title is semi detached ?,btohqsg
its synchronus manual that matches the speed of the both gear cogs that are beside the current engaged gear. It doesnt require a clutch cos its alr rev matched. Cluth is still require to move of the line because... IT ISNT AUTOMATIC.,btohqsg
Ya la u ask ur agent la.,btohqsg
I shd tell the boomer in my company. Semi retired is retired,btohqsg
Wah u still insist it‚Äôs manual ah,btohqsg
This logic has taught me well. Love it,btohqsg

It isnt automatic because the automatic gearbox cannot handle the power and it is far more ineffecient,btohqsg
It is more terminology then anything,btohqsg
the automotive mechanical name is sequential MANUAL gearbox,btohqsg
We go ask f1 boss la. We bet all our assets. Ok ?,btohqsg
Because f1 car is so fast u need 2 hand to be on the steering wheel as the g force is too big   if youUse 1 hand on the steering wheel   and just to change gear u sure buang the car,btohqsg
