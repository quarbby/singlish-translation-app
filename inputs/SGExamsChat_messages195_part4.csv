This is wat happens when ur knowledge comes from listening to others,btohqsg
NYJC is mainly because of the hype,btohqsg
Same if not better than RI HCI,btohqsg
im ok with a shit campus but i j want a place where i can do well,btohqsg
So they attract a ton of good students,btohqsg
Is only 90 rpters that RI HCI has more,btohqsg
You base your opinion off on?,btohqsg
I think it started from 2016,btohqsg
is vjc’s econs and phy As% rate high ah,btohqsg
If n<30  by CLT ur sample isnt normally distributed and thus inaccurate,btohqsg
Well is it true Vj has been depriving?,btohqsg
Idk all the JC1 students im tutorin for chem,btohqsg
Ikr. Then whatever jc I go to in the future must be a dumpster fire,btohqsg
Like I see the cut off decreasing,btohqsg
I use NY NotesAnd they say NY notes are so good,btohqsg
Way btr than their sch notes,btohqsg

But just wanna say something for real,btohqsg
Its not the school that produces 90 rpers,btohqsg
Is the calibre of the ppl in the school,btohqsg
Same. I used to want to go to Eunoia just to experience clean school toilets for once in my life,btohqsg
If i put current 1200 Y5 RI students in YI campus,btohqsg
Your not gonna be able to score,btohqsg
If you put in effort you can stand out among the rest,btohqsg
There’s a basic standard across all JCs,btohqsg
They can self source external resources,btohqsg
Sgexams has more than enough resources,btohqsg
To help u on top of what the sch provides,btohqsg
If u want to talk about resources  the higher tier the JC the less the teachers help u out  so,btohqsg
Jc are not suppose to be easy,btohqsg
