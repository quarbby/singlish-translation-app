Just trying to find out what could be alternative. I don‚Äôt want minimum spending. I‚Äôm lazy to keep track of it. I hadn‚Äôt tried Amaze + Citi Rewards. Does it work?,btohqsg

UOB KF  assume already/will spend $800 on sia,btohqsg

Hi all  if i open up HSBC EGA savings account now  as a new user  I will start from $0. Then after topping up a sum of incremental fresh fund (eg 100k) + fulfil the criteria of 5 eligible transactions  will i get 4.5% on the full 100k? Or interest amount be prorated?,btohqsg
Remember to send sms.From my understanding  If you transfer 100k right away when open ega  you will get1% for incremental fresh fund.3.05% for the promo interest of Nov.So 4.05% on100kMAB  which is lower than 100k,btohqsg
Monthly average balance will be lower than 100k,btohqsg
Usually bank will calc from the day you open account till month end  unless HSBC calc it differently.,btohqsg
lol then I open last day and put 100k get full interest for the month?,btohqsg
Yes  for UOB at least. I don't have recent example for ocbc or dbs.,btohqsg

Can try bank of China. With US rate cut few days ago  SG banks will not be able to reduce it so fast.,btohqsg
