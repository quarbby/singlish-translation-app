I pick R and J wash car over the other options 🤭,btohqsg
He needs engine oil more than wash,btohqsg
His car leaking all the time,btohqsg
What’s the need for engine oil if you’re only driving it for a few days and then go workshop,btohqsg
What's the point for a wash when the car is sitting and collecting dust in the shop,btohqsg
Because you can see R and J washing your car,btohqsg
Unless they do the oil change for you,btohqsg
