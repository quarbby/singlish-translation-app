I trying to see if it's worth to continue work or if it's too tiring,btohqsg
generally is because many students lose marks to presentation unknowingly.Teachers asking students to aim 90% is not wrong because many students do not form proper mathematical logical statements I think.,btohqsg

To add on  for anyone who is really hungry to score well. It's really a matter of action and discipline.In my first semester in NUS after ORD  I took on 6 modules. No CCA but I managed to squeeze in 2 days to swim in NUS pool  2 days in NUS gym  during lunch hours. 2 days of 4km jog too.And for each of the 3 experiments in the single Physics module  I stayed overnight in school in my army friend's hostel room just to work on the answer for the experiment.9am to 8pm lesson day  then overnight work till 5am  take nap  then submit the pract before 8am  to be able to attend next lecture at 8am.And I was still not the most insane one.That semester I scored cap of 5.0.,btohqsg
