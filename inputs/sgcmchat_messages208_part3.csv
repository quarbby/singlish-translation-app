Technically  not hitting kerb  constant checking of blindspot  not looking like a nervous wreck  all a test of your mettle,btohqsg
Skills on Sepang â‰  skill for daily driving,btohqsg

all can be in their 50s,btohqsg
but iâ€™m contradicting ur point lol,btohqsg

and still can fail tp 3 times,btohqsg
Emphasise on a single word  some,btohqsg

Hitting kerb is poor judgement la,btohqsg

One of the crazy one during lunch and after office hrs,btohqsg
why u being so dense bro?,btohqsg
Haha  laze. I got my license i happy. Yâ€™all can enjoy,btohqsg
congrats on taking a funny example very seriously,btohqsg
The number of time u need to check blind spot is countless,btohqsg
iâ€™m not angry or annoyed or anythingbut beats the point for you to throw in a discussion  but not being open to understanding  then being lazy hahaha lol,btohqsg
Cause i talking to a brick wall duh?,btohqsg
err. you meanâ€¦ youâ€™re just voicing out your opinion but not hearing others out?itâ€™s okay if you want to establish that too,btohqsg
Sure keep to your opinion  enjoy,btohqsg
either way u stay left lane only till u need to turn,btohqsg
i wonâ€™t really understand your agitation or your firmness on this topic but sure,btohqsg
sorry   iâ€™m only 16 need to over prepare for my license,btohqsg
what are u talking about bro i check blindspot constantly to be safe,btohqsg
my bro this is why u need to go sch ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
you check blindspots when turning  changing lane & reversing (to cfm safety)you donâ€™t need to check blindspot additional times unless there is a raised safety concern  like a cyclist/motorbike filtering thru traffic,btohqsg
ya i mean when im changing lane then i check ah not when iâ€™m like chilling,btohqsg
priv donâ€™t teach most students the fundamentals at all  thus the high failure rate & the reasons given alw damn funny one,btohqsg
normal la. one time only what,btohqsg
I drive in reverse to be safe so Iâ€™m always checking my blind spot,btohqsg
