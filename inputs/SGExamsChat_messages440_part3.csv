may need some seat adjustments or not so big cars but is can,btohqsg
dw let it grow out for 2 wks,btohqsg
Can adjust the seat lower & fwd,btohqsg
guys did you guys learn about matrices first or linear transformation first,btohqsg
cos iirc initially itâ€™s just introduced as a way to concisely express a set of values,btohqsg
ok bc i think they should hv taught linear transformation first,btohqsg
perhaps. i mean the matrices thats learned just teaches the rules of matrices,btohqsg
but like youâ€™d need some idea of vector spaces etc whereas matrices to express values are quite simple,btohqsg
yeah which forces student to memorise which is what idl about the syllabus,btohqsg
uhh what are you memorising? iâ€™ve been out of that for a long time,btohqsg
19 day confinement is what sia,btohqsg
as in you would have to memorise the rules of matrices without understanding why first,btohqsg
the 2x2 matrix multiplication for example,btohqsg
i find that the case for most o and a levels anyway tho,btohqsg
how the row elements matches the column element,btohqsg
Guys sorry to disturbBut for like O level result do the teacher tell you your result like when sitting down in the table?,btohqsg
if they cared to explain it in linear transformation term it would be the landing coord of the i hat j hat would multiply by the coord of starting vector,btohqsg
you just proved my point ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Or like we have a choice to not see/know the results until we go home,btohqsg
