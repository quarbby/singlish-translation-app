damn bro didnt want his baby,btohqsg
u have 2mins to explain urself if not i’m banning,btohqsg
Not a supercar or modded but still my <3,btohqsg
no need to be modded to love a subaru,btohqsg
Always tempted to tune it and change the exhaust but oh well,btohqsg
H4 or Inline 4? never got to read about these,btohqsg
if H4 then a slight tune is okay what bro  exhaust wise i’m not too sure if will affect fc adversely,btohqsg
Inline 4 if I recall correclty,btohqsg
1.6L 178hp  after tune maybe 20% increase,btohqsg
depends on what tune ur looking at lor,btohqsg
but i think the 178hp is fine  i’m not comfortable w the cvt gearbox only 😂,btohqsg
Yeah that hp is fine also that's why,btohqsg
i would care more about fc  so if you can push out 200 with slight mods is enough already,btohqsg
i think if u decat & do some other stuff to the exhaust that 178 can jump to 210? but thats if u decat la,btohqsg
Maybe take the money go siamdiu better,btohqsg
Just tune without the rest maybe but I don't track also,btohqsg
may allah bless your innocence with a consistent vape supplier,btohqsg
If wrx or sti its must same like civic Type R,btohqsg
They have a saying for civic Type R if u buy one and don't mod might as well throw it into ocean.For subaru wrx and sti not sure tho but cfm have some saying,btohqsg
no need to mod to love a car,btohqsg
Ya just sticker decal can alr lol +25hp,btohqsg
damnson a sf90 went passed me,btohqsg
but mod civic type r till zhng is a mistake,btohqsg

Good afternoon  looking for a relatively clean pre-facelift integra dc5r (no accident history/extensive mods). pm me if you have one/know anyone who doesnt mind selling  thanks.,btohqsg
You don’t stop liking nice cars just because yours is nice too,btohqsg
as a owner of a Koenigsegg i do not like looking at women,btohqsg
But i have a pagani and i still like other cars esp 4 cyl shitboxes,btohqsg
Understand but i mean like fan behaviour car spotting tho?,btohqsg
I mean why not? But thats me,btohqsg
Maybe for some others it might be different,btohqsg
Thats why im asking everyone’s opinion haha imma be like that too,btohqsg
For sure im like that too. I still fangirl like crazy when a gt3 or 720s goes past,btohqsg
Dont think it would matter what car i drove,btohqsg
Realistically may not happen. But you will get invited to nice parties to show your car.,btohqsg
Hi everyone. Just want to know if there's any Mazda drivers here. Cos I just got mine and I'm looking for a workshop to install bodykits and to do slight modifications. Any recommendations?,btohqsg
the garage part i can’t answer,btohqsg
but what are u looking to do specifically?,btohqsg
i believe i have a friend who owns a M2 Hatch,btohqsg
I'm actually looking to install skirtings and bumpers,btohqsg
wheres the dude looking for regera rear fender,btohqsg
he’ll never know what hit him,btohqsg
i was gonna suggest looking to see if he can rent the same model from tribecar or shariot or getgo then swap the panels,btohqsg
Anyone else here really not a fan of the forged carbon exterior pieces?,btohqsg
Forge carbon is find when placed in the correct location,btohqsg
too much of it just makes it look tacky,btohqsg
eh i never add the clunking of shifter sound,btohqsg
agreed but nothing can beat electric bump start cadillac/corvette,btohqsg
the NA1 NSX does it super well from factory. as does the GT4RS  intakes right beside the occupant's ears.,btohqsg
especially on rev match  sounds like vomiting but heaven,btohqsg
ITBs are nice don't get me wrong,btohqsg
imo NA1 and GT4RS takes the cake,btohqsg
HKS open pod on the FD2R still is the best one i've personally experienced though,btohqsg
Best sound is straight cut turbo,btohqsg
waiting for the return of your straight cut turbo,btohqsg
Watch till the end to see surprise (it’s Kendrick),btohqsg
That hand placement looks so uncomfortable,btohqsg
It’s true I was the puddle,btohqsg

Yea it’s common sense but ppl do be stupid at times  a mistake made  at most he apologise and we move on,btohqsg

u made it sound like u telling him ur next project car,btohqsg
woah no wayyy is that the consequences of his action!? 😨 but like bffr  why are u invalidating the reaction of members of the community in the first place? sure your friend apologized and was apparently unaware that he shouldn't be touching things he doesnt own  but it doesn't change the fact that sometimes mistakes  no matter how innocent  aren't forgiven ah.anyway not a big deal  email to the school or what  at most warn him be more careful next time etc and whatnot. from the few times I've spoken to the owner  can tell he's really nice and likely wont be making any police report if nothing was damaged  but doesn't mean yall are allowed to sit on other people's cars okay  take care☺️,btohqsg
