Not sure how a $3.8mil bid by polestar lose to ioniq5’s $1.9mil bid haha. The only difference is polestar package 10yr maintenance,btohqsg
TP happy to top up $1.9mil for maintenance,btohqsg
Typical gahman appraisal of tender 😏,btohqsg
They just wanna have a conti car to drive,btohqsg
The 200k per car for 10 years dont make sense,btohqsg
Ur maintenance per year how much only?,btohqsg
the bidding process went wrong somewhere legit,btohqsg
Think they don't want to give Hyundai contract since they already setup a plant in SG for their ioniq.,btohqsg
Ya polestar 2 omv $40k nia,btohqsg
Profit $160k per car. Not sure what maintenance an EV need over 10yrs 🙃,btohqsg
Just help them pain the car to police colours and attach the siren haha,btohqsg
Bcos Hyundai dont dare to do maintenance on a high mileage electric vehicle,btohqsg
And SMRT has no experience in EV maintenance,btohqsg
Think the package is direct part exchange,btohqsg
Really meh? But now that u mentioned it.. i do see alot old mazdas previously,btohqsg
Tax payer money. The justification really not there. Later another brompton case,btohqsg
Can keep as long as possible,btohqsg
A lot goes into new gen police vehicles,btohqsg
I suspect they going to include additional power pack or battery to power the other electronics,btohqsg
The load  the gps  the cameras,btohqsg
Now big qn is maintenance contract is for how many years,btohqsg
power will just come from the car battery la,btohqsg
The S60  XC60 tht the sec comd uses  all has extra battery pack in e car,btohqsg
bruh if you use car battery to charge additional power pack  what's the point,btohqsg
Nt engh to power everything la,btohqsg
Tht small battery infrnt where gt engh,btohqsg
Cos i have sat n drove in one?,btohqsg
and now you're the expert in retrofitting police vehicles got it,btohqsg
Older gen cars dont come w maintenance. Its just purely buying.Retrofitting to add stuffs are done by contractors frm the supplier.Maintenance are done by SMRT. At least tht was where the vehicles r sent to,btohqsg
The S60 n XC60 died so often tht they have to modify and add another battery seperate frm the main car just to power the light bars n other additional electronics,btohqsg
The older avantes n altis tht i drove in the past  battery died so often tht some patrol cars have portable jump start in them,btohqsg
323 is still alive. subaru ts also alive,btohqsg
I think there's one or two 2000's Corolla still surviving,btohqsg
Shortest lifespan for police vehicle was probably the Subaru TS n WRX,btohqsg
Replaced almost immediately after they bought it,btohqsg
Cos they missed out one impt factor in the tender,btohqsg
The ability to mount riot mesh,btohqsg
Good morning to all here and spammers!!!!,btohqsg
Morning! Wanna ask Would u guys change frm an a3 to octavia for its practicality and features?or change to new néw a3?,btohqsg
You want more passenger space and boot space is it,btohqsg
For new car ard 180 to 200k.couldnt stretch up,btohqsg
If brand is not a important criteria then Octavia since the space is huge,btohqsg
I feel the brand OK lah.,btohqsg
If brand is then a3 or 216 gc,btohqsg
A3 to a3 like no change. Haha,btohqsg
For me is ok too.. but for others cold brand,btohqsg
It has alot of safety features,btohqsg
Octavia make it up with the size and features,btohqsg
Octavia for sure  much more spacious and more power. Audi want to buy at least buy flagship A4  any smaller not worth. Inside the hoot  the parts are largely the same,btohqsg
Skoda abit no resale value leh I feel. If u change freq then get a car that sort of has demand. Skoda maybe a few more years then have like BMW/Mercsthis sort of “demand”,btohqsg
But i must say from a price point  skoda is very attractive,btohqsg
Sure got trade off. Singaporeans are a sucker for branding,btohqsg

Yes better check mileage w VW,btohqsg
Only after u buy then VW will release servicing records to u,btohqsg
But if dealer confident mileage is authentic then okay lo,btohqsg
If not buy alr 100k mileage then u can just sue… :),btohqsg
Or seller can get copy of records I suppose,btohqsg
I think VW dun issue to dealer also leh,btohqsg
That time i buy mine both dealers say VW never release to them,btohqsg
I thought press can get free Merc ah,btohqsg
I feel its dumb leh  if lets say got smth happen  the vehicle need increase speed to avoid it  eg a tyre flying,btohqsg
Instead of stepping enforcement  they do this kind of tubbish,btohqsg
shiok because of how much you spent?,btohqsg

Not so powerful.. mine adapted to racing only .,btohqsg

As long as the rental and car sharing companies have free reign to manipulate COE prices it'll never go down,btohqsg
ADs and PIs also earn more from loan commissions  so they wouldn't mind high prices also,btohqsg
Yah  these group wouldn't want coe to drop,btohqsg
Any extra supply would just be absorbed by more demand cos buyers fear no more chance,btohqsg
So coe as a tool to control car population is crap,btohqsg
Gahmen get more money to give us GST vouchers lol,btohqsg
Take from me chicken farm and give me a chicken wing,btohqsg
I also dun want the coe to drop . I want it to continue to raise .,btohqsg
Because I bought at high coe mah,btohqsg
If coe drop   means I will lose more $$$ when selling,btohqsg
I also buy at high coe,btohqsg
But cant wait for it to drop,btohqsg
But election should come before 2025,btohqsg
I hope when coe drop  all the used car dealers hg  need scrap or sell at lower price,btohqsg
Before the implementation of the erp 2.0,btohqsg
By right w ERP 2.0 COE should be scrapped,btohqsg
But they never mention anything about it,btohqsg
My friend told me coe will remain,btohqsg
So charge me COE + Car usage,btohqsg
This govt is getting too greedy,btohqsg
They want people to use the transportation system they build,btohqsg
If not why they dig and dig,btohqsg
Tats why forcing ppl go back office,btohqsg
But you get back balance coe when you sell ma,btohqsg
He buy at high coe + PARF / OMV,btohqsg
Then when he sell when coe low  his coe amt is reduced alr,btohqsg
i believe coe is high is 5G agenda,btohqsg
they slap u give u $1 its for your own good. then they take $2 from u. history repeat itself  pap always like that,btohqsg
LW cannot be PM nor are the current batch. that is IMHO i will never give them my vote,btohqsg
Thank goodness you're not running our country then.,btohqsg
haha bro y u always a pro,btohqsg
i respect your opinion but will not give them my vote,btohqsg
He not running ? He just saying they CMI. 🫨 subjective. I think LW can  but some of the appt holders cmi.. esp small space,btohqsg
I'm not pro PAP  but not anti PAP either. Just LW is capable enough  but he needs to choose the right people for the cabinet,btohqsg
Coe is a necessary evil i feel,btohqsg
If nt whole street flooded w cars,btohqsg
But exploited by some commercial entities for profit,btohqsg
That one needs to be stopped,btohqsg
Wait till u feel the frustration in CBD during evening rush hour home,btohqsg
They say its a open market. Willing buyer willing seller,btohqsg
U can alrdy afford to buy a car. Whats ths extra 10-20k for coe,btohqsg
Easier to say that than work on a policy. Brings them more money also so...,btohqsg
No single policy can tailor to everyone,btohqsg
bruh this is every country problem,btohqsg
we dont compare peak  everyone trying to get to work and go home,btohqsg
Half the COE price  double the amount of cars on the road  and alternate the carplate even and odd number allowed on the road lol,btohqsg
Wah really leh  idk how people can drive back and forth in peak hours,btohqsg
I send my wife to work at 9am already I wanna cry in the jam,btohqsg
And that’s only bedok to paya lebar,btohqsg
This one like last time go market during covid,btohqsg
I remember Iraq did this haha,btohqsg

They just need to seperate PHV frm Private Cars will do,btohqsg
Then limit the number of PHV cars,btohqsg
Then disallow the conversion of phv to private,btohqsg
And then private to phv can only be done once,btohqsg
PHv shud follow formula like taxi,btohqsg
Eg based on population then no bidding,btohqsg
Maybe 10 years scrap n sell haha,btohqsg
I think a lot of planning for PHV was done,btohqsg
Covid shown us that economy downturn sometimes is opposite reaction,btohqsg
Covid never bring coe down to $1 like 2008 2009 financial crisis,btohqsg
They suppose to limit phv cars to 10yrs,btohqsg
End up died of natural death,btohqsg
Lol in singapore buy car will never have profit  its only higher or lower losses,btohqsg
It has became an income generating tool instead,btohqsg
I siam highway during peak  rather put up with the red lights,btohqsg
They won't give up on carlite la  whoever or whichever party is governing will realise that it is impossible to remove COE without imposing new tax that will have the same effect to deter buyer from getting their own vehicle.,btohqsg
Now so many non car owner already accustomed to using PHV  removing those and give the COE to a handful of car owners will look damn ugly on the government,btohqsg
Like taking public resources and only giving to the elites that can afford,btohqsg
But i guess it'll have to do for now to ensure some form of price moderation,btohqsg
Kill of those 5yrs n 10yrs renewed coe,btohqsg
By thn more quota cos no more diesel car,btohqsg
But more coe means pi can buy more new cars n get rid of their older cars by exporting or convert to phv,btohqsg

is turbo muffler delete illegal in Singapore?,btohqsg
No la turbo muffler just reduce the sound from your turbocharger only... You delete also nobody cares,btohqsg
You mod this thing think of how many more toto you can buy,btohqsg
But think abt how cool u will sound,btohqsg
If you delete this muffler can hear this sound something wrong with your car,btohqsg
Ohh u talking abt the cat delete,btohqsg
I thought we still on turbo muffler topic,btohqsg
No la the stututu need BOV,btohqsg
Ya that’s wad I told him,btohqsg
Idk leh. Some ppl say they go inspection no issue,btohqsg
All unapproved exhaust mods are not legal la,btohqsg
My fren suppose to go inspection and lmk but he sold the car b4 he bring for inspection,btohqsg
Until one day you kena borescope inspection,btohqsg
Old cars won’t  those 2015 and above yes,btohqsg
oh i heard some ppl do turbo muffler delete and BOV tgt,btohqsg
1.4 stustustu ltr kena stomp lah..,btohqsg
Huh? No la not BOV. It is Compressor surge.It happens airflow to the intake manifold is low as you off throttle and the throttle body is now closed  but the air pressure from the turbo is high. Now this high air pressure should go somewhere  but there is no way to move forward. So this air pressure tries to escape back through the turbo making the stustustu sound  as the turbo blades are spinning in the opposite direction.,btohqsg
Stomp you for stustustu? Lame leh. Stomp those got back firing one better la,btohqsg
i know it's cool and all copy pasta from somewhere to sound clever... but what part do you think holds the boost and causes the turbo flutter?  hahaha,btohqsg
it's the diverter valve or BOV,btohqsg
just mod until you happy can liao,btohqsg
piang liao rebuild simple as that,btohqsg
i was planning if coe renew i will do one overhaul,btohqsg
Thanks for your feedback. I typed that out cause I remembered it cause my vehicle has them and to better understand it.You do not need any of those and in fact the lack of those is what causes the flutter. The divert valve and BOV are the things to prevent the flutter.This video would help you understand betterhttps://youtu.be/BFXIgME_5UA?si=Y_GPwZSwy7ZNqThW,btohqsg
Sport cat worth to fit not ah,btohqsg
