a bit weird even for myself to realize,btohqsg
it's still btr as compared to playing with fire,btohqsg
im proud but not proud to say that i have been consuming more than 50k words per week,btohqsg
ok  maybe include news article & other stuff as well,btohqsg
Anyone have the tele link to the study chat   the link expired last i checked.üôè,btohqsg
which study chat?u can try checking the first pinned message,btohqsg
"you did received proper black and white after being ""fired"". Or gotten an official termination notice hor?",btohqsg
That's what they did with the other cashier that they hated,btohqsg
I signed my exit clearance already,btohqsg
as long black and white done properly,btohqsg
Because now I have to wait 2 more weeks for my pay,btohqsg
When it's suppose to come in 1 week,btohqsg
üòç oh its 2k tho so nvm no complaints,btohqsg
2k is considered not bad for a part time job. Can cover for such expenditure - 1k for rent + 1k for monthly expenditure,btohqsg
2k/mnth for a pt job is easier to hit once u hv consistently got used to going to work everyday  regardless of half-day or full-day shift (usually 12hrs max)not including OT (overtime) as well but yeah,btohqsg
better than having my RM 5k Engineering job. üòÇ,btohqsg
idk how does one survive with 5k rm,btohqsg
let alone those eatery places hiring ppl for 1k rm/month,btohqsg
and the number of ppl i see hiring for 3k/month is crazy,btohqsg
ok tbf  some eateries overseas provide accommodations / meals,btohqsg
RM 5k is considered comfortable already lol,btohqsg
but yeah 5K RM is nowhere near a comfortable life,btohqsg
I have friends still earning RM 3k.,btohqsg
maybe a good job in malaysia,btohqsg
what sort of job & position,btohqsg
especially if ur friends work in similar industries,btohqsg
Analog Engineer in Intel - Fresh Grad is RM 4k.He's doing some sort of German Audit Firm is RM 3.5k ish,btohqsg
need to slave over my back lo. Or spend very frugally tbh.,btohqsg
I work remote  so cost of living is lower abit.,btohqsg
I guess RM 5k  net is about RM 4.2k ish (nett).- Telco Postpaid Family Plan - Unlimited Data + 30 Mbps Fibre - RM 350 month for 5 pax- Penang Rental room - RM 350/month (I hardly stay in Penang so didn't have to pay utilities)- Food - RM 30/day * 30 = RM 900- Electrical Bill - RM 300 - 400 / month due to family high air cond usage- Insurance + Medical Plan - RM 320- Others I put misc. spending,btohqsg
so I can say I am living somewhat comfortable.But those random misc. spending normally would be quite annoying.,btohqsg
like Car maintenance - local made Perodua Bezza Sedan is like RM 2k-3k / year.Then transport to Penang and KL - RM 100-200/month if my bosses wanted me to be in Penang.,btohqsg
got savings  but not much  in Singapore it is easier to save to buy an iPhone working a part time job compared to Malaysians üòÇ,btohqsg
as long I don't go to some famous Cafe  or go family dinner at some Zhu Char. I think would be fine most of the time.,btohqsg
Cafe mostly - RM 30-50; Chu Char for 5pax normally RM 150-200/meal depending what my family orders.,btohqsg
its still liveable. just that you won't save as fast as those working in Singapore üòÇ,btohqsg
buying a house is out of the question.Since housing for non-Bumi is normally RM 400k onwards.,btohqsg
me when i love bumiputra policy,btohqsg
Aye remote dam nice tho companies cutting back on it,btohqsg
In Singapore I expected ok la,btohqsg
Wut median wage in Singapore is now $5k,btohqsg
Need to ask this minister how he get his stats lol,btohqsg
generally speaking  5k/mnth media salary is a bit vague,btohqsg
ok now i go and become influencer,btohqsg
i mean it isn't wrong if you're just looking at the general statistics,btohqsg
LOOL influencers & politicians technically can earn way more than that,btohqsg
my father doesn't even hold 5k with his full-time manager job ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
I mean based on this median stats it means atleast half of Singapore earn more than $5k,btohqsg
naomi neo was the only oddity,btohqsg
I thought median is refer to 50 percent of the bell curve,btohqsg
