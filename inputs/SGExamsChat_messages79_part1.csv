Arent aldehydes carbonyl grp with a hydrogen?,btohqsg
because it ends w a H,btohqsg
so anything before that doesn't matter,btohqsg
but your R2 is H leh,btohqsg
Skeletal structure usually don't put H,btohqsg
Skeletal formula  so if you see a C that doesn’t have 4 bonds  the remaining bonds are H,btohqsg
Ik the diagram is aldehyde  but he asking if C=O means aldehyde,btohqsg
just remember that aldehydes have the formula RCHO,btohqsg
It can be carbozilic acid  ketone or aldehyde  need see what the groip,btohqsg
Btw if you want to send questions of this level can try@SGExamsStudiesAs,btohqsg
I was tryingto find the grp but i couldnt,btohqsg
sorry all of u big brain,btohqsg
you asked if anyone was from biomed,btohqsg
you have a great memory haha,btohqsg
No one begins skool with knowledge of everything,btohqsg
In the picture he send  the R2 happen to be H  so it's aldehyde,btohqsg
But generally u need see what's the R group,btohqsg
Can be H can be hydrocarbon,btohqsg
HAHA i begin skool in a place i dont rly wna be in,btohqsg
but a lot of chem in your course whatt,btohqsg
so should be q fun  right?,btohqsg
ya but the specialistion stuff starts in y2,btohqsg
Except... maybe... the person say don’t expose... but we know who hahaha,btohqsg
ill have problems w those mainly regarding my course,btohqsg
This diagram will be more accurate if you're talking about ketones,btohqsg
i am from plant-san growing course,btohqsg
hello  from plant san growing course,btohqsg
Plants were never made to live forever,btohqsg
All plants do is just stand there,btohqsg
then where your O2 come from,btohqsg
Let's just face that all things will be perished in the future,btohqsg
itsok the person who earns is co owner,btohqsg
if there weren't plants we would all have died,btohqsg
you think humans would survive to discover the hydrolysis of water?,btohqsg
Yeah but r is used as an abbreviation of any group in which contains hydrogen or carbon,btohqsg
Many people say that science doesn’t have any room for argument,btohqsg
many people say i shld quit sci :>>,btohqsg
U need ur own sticker pack,btohqsg
but you can argue about what you can't see with the naked eye,btohqsg
john has his sticker pack tho,btohqsg
Ya! Lamarck’s theory is correct  no questions need to be asked.,btohqsg
I just realised we have sgexamsmemes,btohqsg
mine’s a crashed down site 404 not found,btohqsg
I will contact the sticker pack manager to add it by next week,btohqsg
yes yes v official & impt,btohqsg
Ahh sry guys but is it only in acyclic form glucose has aldehyde functional grp or both acyclic n cyclic?,btohqsg
Much like the plant san admin,btohqsg
I’m only good at saying things not doing things,btohqsg
Look at the structure change when it cyclise,btohqsg
Ask in the A level group,btohqsg
