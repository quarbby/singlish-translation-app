Never ask cashier  but do you think they know? Maybe from experience,btohqsg
thanks for the list! bringing my child to thomson medical clinic now  will use amaze + crmc for payment,btohqsg
For UOB one credit card the 500 spend does it have to be for that statement (around 13th of this month to 12 of next month) or within the month itself (1-30/31st of the month)?,btohqsg
Haha they often don‚Äôt know either,btohqsg
U can call UOB to change it (1st to 30/31st of the month).,btohqsg
Hi I am about to relocate career to airport.Did scout the area their canteen only accept cash or QR payment.Last month started using amaze cardAnyone know how to purchase food with QR payment using amaze?,btohqsg
Wow! Possible? When did they do that for you?,btohqsg
I just change mine last week.. I told them that changing to 1-30/31st will be easier for me to monitor my spending..,btohqsg
Will have to call them again then. The lady didn't tell me can change lol. Will it apply for previous two months statement also? Because mine counts Nov Dec Jan as one quarter,btohqsg
Sry I‚Äôm not too sure about the previous 2 months.. u can try asking UOB.. see how they can help with this..,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see hospital is excluded in their tnchttps://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/Rewards_Exclusion_List.pdf,btohqsg
Anyone pay their government outpatient bills via healthhub before?When I request to pay via healthhub/online  The CS at CGH have no idea how it can done.,btohqsg
Just go home  bill will be updated on healthhub the next day,btohqsg
no change to previous 2 month statements. only affect current statement month,btohqsg
Hey guys  can I check regarding Instarem Amaze and CitiBank Rewards cards?I saw from Honey Money SG videos stating that:- CitiBank Rewards card can earn us 10x points = 4 MPD- To ensure we fully grab the 10x points (4 MPD)  maximum cap of SGD 1 000/statement month  we can link it to Instarem Amaze card.Does this mean to say anything I use to pay with my Amaze card linked to my CitiBank Rewards card  I can get 10x points (4 MPD)?Pay and spend as in:- In SG food/doctor/pet grooming/vet shops- Online websites such as KlookBecause I am still trying to understand what online transaction means.Recently I made a purchase in a local store via Klook with my Amaze card linking to CitiBank Rewards cards. On 27 and 28 Dec  it was already posted (Sum of S$4+ and S$900+  respectively). But I'm only getting 1k+ points?,btohqsg
You must also be aware of the 10X points exclusions  namely  travel. Since Klook is a travel agent  it only earns 1X points.,btohqsg
so it is not rewarding 10 points from travel even through amaze card? i thought amaze can make everything into online purchase,btohqsg
Please watch this video for credit card strategy 2022 to understand the various card strategies. Other than the absolute cashback and grabpay 1.2% nerfed. The rest of the discussion is still valid (for now)https://youtu.be/v5mTqPuvmCk,btohqsg
There's a ton of articles out there about the usage of Amaze card already...It is not a magical card. It only converts any spend into online spend  which is one of the easier requirements of getting the 10x points.It does not however  convert the MCC behind the transaction. Since CRMC excludes all travel related spends  using the amaze card doesn't matter.For e.g. using CRMC on its own to buy stationery at popular may not get you the 10x points (because its not department stores  or shops selling bags  shoes and clothes as offline spend) but when amaze converts it to online spend  then it counts as retail online spend,btohqsg
Correct  but Amaze excludes travel from earning 10X points  even if it's online. Hence  passing through Amaze will still earn you 1X points only,btohqsg
you might want to read up on what MCC means  and how the instarem card doesn't change the MCC of the business (store)also should read up on CRMC's MCC exclusions,btohqsg
ok so meaning any SG store (Excluding travel store related like luggage store etc.) i can earn 10x points (4 MPD) if i use Amaze card link to CRMC?,btohqsg
Basically just avoid travel related transactions with amaze + CRMC,btohqsg
thank you I am new to credit card. I want to make sure one thing:can amaze card transfer offline paypass to online shoping  so i can get 10x points? like eating in food repbulic and buy staff in challenger?,btohqsg
Yes! Suggest u get used to reading exclusion list as a new CC user too so that you can independently learn and teach othershttps://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/Rewards_Exclusion_List.pdf,btohqsg
i think i understand a little. online shopping is not subject to a mcc code but a way to pay the merchant. so no mattee how to pay the travel expense  it is still travel expense.,btohqsg
I will publish a single credit card strategy for cashback users tomorrow night,btohqsg
generally those are okay too. best to read up on MCC exclusions like what the others have mentioned :)one good thing about CRMC is that the points are posted within 1-3 days in the internet banking portal (unlike some banks where u can only see it when statement comes). so you can take some time to track them more digiligently and get used to the 10x hack (while it lasts),btohqsg
Yes üëç welcome to the world of CC ü§£I just started too  got CRMC + Amaze and HSBC Revo for travel spendingsOCBC titanium next for big purchases,btohqsg
yes  it's great to know the result so we can change plan asapüòÅ,btohqsg
i want hsbc revo as well  but i am waiting for the time when it has a sign-up gift.,btohqsg
Will the point also appear in mobile app?,btohqsg
thanks guys! i am so clear about amaze with crcc now!üòÅüòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
Now should have a sign-up rebate bonus,btohqsg
thanks! let me find out :D,btohqsg
YesCitibank shows the base + bonus points quite fast while HSBC only shows base points after 1-2 days and bonus points at the end of the statement month (which is very annoying but a price worth paying for 4MPD  I guess),btohqsg
Amaze OP pairings:- OCBC TR: for big-ticket purchases under the relevant MCCs- UOB Lady's: travel as 10X category  for travel expenses- CRMC: for everything else- UOB PRVI MC / OCBC 90N MC / Citi Premiermiles MC: when you bust the cap on the aforementioned cards,btohqsg
there are cashback cards also like maybank fnf  citi cashback  hsbc premier  sc manhatten  boc qoo10  icbc zodiac,btohqsg
oh yeah I am talking more about miles side. Also ICBC cards can't pair with Amaze,btohqsg
but HSBC revo card if spent overseas got foreign exchange charges right? hahah,btohqsg
i think you can use amaze oversea  it will help you earn award from cc like you spend it locally,btohqsg
No sign up bonus now. I think until 31st Dec still have cashback or samsonite luggage. Will also like to get hsbc revolution. Not sure if it's a lot better than the crmc amaze though,btohqsg
It will still lead u to the desktop site if I'm not wrong. I personally prefer to just check on computer as its easier,btohqsg
thanks  i think i will wait.,btohqsg
but cannot pair hsbc revo to Amaze cos it is not mastercard,btohqsg
Most clinics MCCs are 8011. My understanding is TCM clinics MCCs are 8099,btohqsg
when he say travel spending he meant booking for flight/hotel/tour online/contactless,btohqsg
But in general amaze and crmc really better than just changing money at money changer and spending cash overseas meh?,btohqsg
yes if u value 4mpd higher than the exchange rate difference,btohqsg
Don't forget the convenience and the risk of carrying too much cash also..,btohqsg
