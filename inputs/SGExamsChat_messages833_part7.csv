It's a lot cheaper than ManaDr but I'm not too sure about it,btohqsg
Cus it's $6+ only but I saw another online was $11+,btohqsg
manadr has long lost its credibility after it came under fire for ppl abusing the teleconsultation so if you're wanting to get an medical certificate through such a service  you might want to confirm with your superiors/lecturers/teachers whether they accept MCs with such origins,btohqsg
anyways this is according to their FAQ,btohqsg
ppl would say who cares because teleconsultation services are cheap & fastjust like the situation with getting free money from the luckysg bot despite knowing it's sussy,btohqsg
tbf teleconsult is quick n dirty way to get mc,btohqsg
they have the incentive to drag the consult on lol,btohqsg
not done yet ... next is to remove cycling paths and turn it to footpath,btohqsg
But even 2 minutes for $11 also can?,btohqsg
Omg I actly didn't bother reading into it,btohqsg
Ig they don't care as long as MOH certified,btohqsg
Wait you legit get free money?,btohqsg
I'm just scared if it's a scam and isn't certified,btohqsg
there been many other simillar bots  yes you get money but majority will like get cents,btohqsg
Idk but I don't really trust free money  especially cus the stats for scams are extremely high,btohqsg
you just need to understand what information you‚Äôre giving out,btohqsg
and i doubt they'll let a participant with potential bias join even if im within range lol,btohqsg
If I am over 18 but mentally 16  can I join hahaha,btohqsg
Anyone who's awake at 3am is eligible,btohqsg
Thats an 18 year old sleep schedule,btohqsg
But at 18  I slept at 10 pm tho :0,btohqsg
i think at 18 i was already sleeping at 2am,btohqsg
i found out my body can only handle max 4 days of sleeping at 5am before i fall sick,btohqsg
im practically awake at nightshift hrs watching yt vids,btohqsg
