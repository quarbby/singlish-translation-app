Yo those taking exam in 2020 regardless: PSLE / GCE-level exams y'all  can view your results online according to moe...Evidence:https://bit.ly/31O8mBs,btohqsg
Online not as exciting as physically,btohqsg
MOE said that students can also return to their respective schools to collect their results as it recognises that doing so marks an important milestone.Those who wish to collect their results in person can do so in individual classrooms instead of large crowded venues  such as the school hall. They will have to comply with safe management practices.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/results-for-2020-national-examinations-will-be-released-online-and,btohqsg
