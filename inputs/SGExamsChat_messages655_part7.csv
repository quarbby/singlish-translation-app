At least it’s comparable to nyjc/vjc,btohqsg
I think you need to see other sch campuses in order to appreciate ej campus more,btohqsg
Njc seems to be the worst,btohqsg
alot of chers hypothesising that this year we will severely underperform for a levels,btohqsg
I suppose once you get the data can update us,btohqsg
For acjc they normally only give more detailed data on the dist rate for each subject during like founders day or some other service,btohqsg
But I suppose you can ask the ej geog teachers and they won’t mind telling,btohqsg
Like exactly how many students get each grade,btohqsg
Whether I choose to say it here,btohqsg
Maybe just say the dist rate I guess,btohqsg
Or round it off to the nearest 10 just like you did for Econs,btohqsg
Nvm I realised that will be considered moonlighting,btohqsg
I wish I could do that,btohqsg
its not moonlighting unless u get cf,btohqsg
according to some hr dxo from my camp,btohqsg
Sry cos I deleted the msg just now,btohqsg
idk i just get paid to write essays,btohqsg
Do you want to see my brother’s dissertation and offer some critique,btohqsg
I couldn’t understand 95% of what he wrote there lol cos my English sucks,btohqsg
im friends with the nus linguistic faculty,btohqsg
if its smth i would enjoy reading then sure,btohqsg
Like studying sentence structures I think,btohqsg
A lot of it is very technical,btohqsg
yeah i co-wrote a linguistics paper,btohqsg
but idk the status of its publication,btohqsg
I think si yan said he can write better with his foot lol,btohqsg
My handwriting is pretty crappy too,btohqsg
i can probably write better with my mouth,btohqsg
i do not remember my handwriting,btohqsg
i'd be willing to put money on this,btohqsg
can i digress for a moment,btohqsg
when i see people on telehitch,btohqsg
generally if their username is like the xmm kind,btohqsg
as in their dad walked out,btohqsg
They no aircon in every class,btohqsg
Even the old jjc campus had aircon in every class,btohqsg
OMG EJC has no aircon in some classes,btohqsg
I thought with a $100 million + budget all classes would’ve had,btohqsg
thrs 4 levels of classes with no aircon,btohqsg
its because of how tall ej is,btohqsg
the 4 non ac classes are,btohqsg
my hr guy say its not,btohqsg
Tbh if moe needed more IP schs  should’ve just converted existing ones instead of creating a new one,btohqsg
Merging schs while creating a new sch is quite stupid,btohqsg
I think nyjc should’ve been converted,btohqsg
the whole loophole thing was some of the funniest entertainment i've gotten from sge in a while,btohqsg
Ngl I think the new principal would be very excited if moe announced during his tenure that nyjc will be a new IP sch,btohqsg
In fact I would think he wants it,btohqsg
Bro don't make me question my Chinese standards like yhat,btohqsg
I had to Google translate it,btohqsg
