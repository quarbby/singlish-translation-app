No need go just let them continue charge since I never paid the bill and doesn't affect me also coz tje number already on giga connection.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
If you choose not to inform it becomes your issue as well.. vs if on record you did take the effort to go down to inform...then their records will show and if they still bill you after  they bodoh,btohqsg
