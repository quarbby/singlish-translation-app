tldr ; he was making several members of the community uncomfortable. he kept pestering in the sense of thinking he's joking when he wasn't in truth. he then followed to make a few jokes that made several of our regular active members raise their brows to his words as he didn't sound too nice with saying it.im gonna repeat this to anyone else   if you have an issue or problem going on in your life right now  please do not involve anyone else into your own issue or your own thoughts about the whole thing all in all.it is not YOUR FAULTneither does the fault lies with OTHER PPLthere's no such thing as inherently correct or wrong because it's essentially morals judged  shaped and phased by societytldr; please do not give emotional baggage to someone else. if it's not the first time and you're giving many people the creeps  please stop and just leave the conversation as it is.,btohqsg
