It is nice before expenses start to takeover your life and you‚Äôre doing financial planning already!Very commendable.,btohqsg
Hi will dbs altitude card earn points for healthhub? Thanks,btohqsg
why those company like lock your money one will always have decreasing interest rates? Example 3 months 3% then 6 months 2.8% 12 months 2.5% returns. So is this more worth to put 3 months or more? Knowing interest rate might change be it increase or decrease after i lock  what option would you choose?,btohqsg
Maybe they expect interest rates to drop in the longer term?,btohqsg
Mhmm  so if it was you which would you choose? Take higher interest rate for shorter term or lower interest rate for longer term? Assuming this is money you do not need urgently.,btohqsg
Do you expect interest rates to drop further? And to what extent? To me a 0.5 drop within 12 months is quite a lotBanks have more data than us and better skilled people to predict  general assumption though üòÇBest is you hedge a bet before any announcements of interest rate drops before banks can react. Then you win a little.If not just play with those high interest savings account.In the end  I feel it‚Äôs just a small proportion of the overall sum to worry too much over it. You win some you lose some.,btohqsg
for credit card bills payment  am I right to say that we need to use AXS to pay our bills? cos I can't seem to find any button in their apps for payment. Citi rewards card n HSBC revo card. also  there is no payment for Amazed card right? cos from my understanding  it links to my Citi rewards card.,btohqsg
Read credit card statements  there should have some instructions printed on the statement on how to pay the bills.,btohqsg
I closed my UOB lady‚Äôs card in 2020 and until now the UOB wont let me approve my application for the card. Anyone knows why?,btohqsg
maybe u open and close many UOB cards just for the benefits and don't spend with it,btohqsg
Why use a base rate card lol. 4mpd card like dbs wwmc and citi reward should work,btohqsg

any news on whether ocbc will have moneysmart promos on their credit cards any time soon?,btohqsg
Which card is good for retail spend on large ticket items? Eg. Above $1k (like buying Tv at Harvey Norman as an example laptop at physical shop in Funan),btohqsg
Looking for a card to maximize my 10k spending of Singapore airlines tickets. Most cards have monthly capped.,btohqsg
Saw Maybank horizon visa has upped to 10k but the promo seems to ended in June,btohqsg
it is still $10k all along  but 2.8mpd now.. (no 3.2mpd),btohqsg
if singapore airlines direct website  use UOB Krisflyer CC,btohqsg
Hi all  if i paired amaze + Maybank FnF and spend at overseas restaurant or groceries  will all recognize as Online Shopping category?,btohqsg
I am am using mobile app,btohqsg
same.. use UOB krisflyer cc if large amounts... it is uncapped 3mpd,btohqsg
Oh ok I was thinking of using DBS woman card which is 4mpd but capped at 1.5k/mth,btohqsg
well are you able to break the ticket purchases into $1.5k sizes?likely no.. so UOB KF CC is the best for your situation in my opinion,btohqsg
Thanks but too late to apply now üòî need to book by today,btohqsg
Since you need to buy today  then what card do you have ? Asking best card can‚Äôt help you much.,btohqsg
no  online shopping only if MCC is whitelisted under online shopping. Dining MCC fall under dining category. Groceries MCC fall under groceries catrgory.,btohqsg
DBS woman  Amex ascend  Maybank horizon visa  DBS attitude visa  citi premier,btohqsg
then just use maybank horizon visa signature for 2.8mpd,btohqsg
make sure you got the correct version,btohqsg
Ocbc rarely has promo. Like once or twice a year only.,btohqsg
Looks like it is between Maybank Horizon Visa(max bonus miles cap at 40 000 Treat points)  n DBS Alti with 5mpd promo max $2k(need pre-registered).,btohqsg
Search#btsbut a quick answer will be uob ppv/vs,btohqsg
i see  thanks for the reply!,btohqsg
Question  is it more worth it to apply for the Citi rewards card through heymax or the official Citibank page?,btohqsg
Assuming you are new to bank  It‚Äôs more worth to apply through HMSG‚Äôs singsaver link here:https://hmsg.link/citirewardsThey currently have a good promo now  $400 cash reward is quite high for Citibank also. Cheers,btohqsg
ooo does this also give me the citibank signup rewards (40 000 thank you points) if i spend 800 within 2 months?,btohqsg
It's either or. 400$ from singsaver or 40k thankyou points,btohqsg
