Your Evening Read - 23 July 2021The Covid-19 Delta variant took the world by storm. As a result  we are experiencing a more contagious variant contributing to several travel restrictions abroad and locally in several developed economies. This is a worrying sign as cyclical stocks are pushing ahead for more gains on the backdrop of pent-up demand in a post-pandemic world.In this episode  we will explore the Airline sector  a vital pillar of the aviation and employment outlook in the US. So let’s roll on that.A look at American Airlines (AAL)Based on the latest earning results  US airlines had a splendid comeback. Take American Airlines Group (AAL)  which exceeded estimates for both revenue and earnings in the quarter. The expected adjusted loss was $2.03 per share  but it registered a better result of $1.69 per share. With the federal payroll support and tax credits  AAL turned into a profit of $19 million  a 3 cents per share.It is also shifting gear to the pre-pandemic capacity. As a result  it is expected to fly by about 90% of its domestic seat capacity and roughly 80% of its international segment this summer. Nonetheless  its route to pretax profits might take longer than its legacy competitors  United Airlines (UAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL)  as AAL has a considerable debt load. Despite having plans to pay down these debts  as an article notes  it continued to be a burden on its balance sheet in the near term.A Stronger Balance Sheet in Southwest Airlines (LUV)On the other spectrum  LUV appears to have the most robust balance sheet among the carriers. It has substantial exposure to domestic leisure travel  which is one of Pika World’s favourites. With a healthy financial situation and riding on the tailwind of domestic travel  it should see a joy of profits in the reopening economy.The recent quarter result was less pleasing. Although revenue hits expectation  the earnings per share disappointed investors as jet fuel prices drag the bottom line. Nonetheless  with healthy ticket booking trends and that leisure traffic had rebounded above 2019 levels on a decent fare level  LUV can have a definite trend ahead.It is with sunshine in a cloudy skyChallenges are always plenty and surface when investors least expect them. At Pika World  we do have some concerns about the sector despite our generally optimistic outlook. First  jet fuel prices have risen sharply in the past months  which is eating into operating profit. Second  the fall travel season also sees seasonally weak leisure demand  and airlines would have to see substantial corporate travel to exceeds Wall Street’s rising targets.Next  as our opening suggests  Delta variant is showing its teeth that could likely moderate travel momentum or even stall the growth if travel restrictions are put in place. Unfortunately  despite Europe’s reopening of borders to US Citizens  President Biden is less willing to lift travel restrictions for visitors from Europe  including major Asian economies such as China and India.The 2H2021 trading and investing journey will face many bumps along the way. As we made adjustments in this mid-cycle economic transition  a stroll is perhaps a wiser pace than a sprint.Have the best of the day.Cheers  Pika Nat.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a broader audience.,btohqsg

You key in high price above that .. can get what ever price on it .. which open,btohqsg

Yes .. if you key in higher price on the open market,btohqsg

the other day i queue 8+ in the morning  notice after i queue  the number in queue remains unchanged. Think some people got priority,btohqsg
You try key in higher price next time,btohqsg
For example open price is 420 .. you key in 430 or 435 above the open price .. your sure to get it,btohqsg
If open 420  they give the 430 or 435 first?,btohqsg

If open 420 you key in 420 get ... Confirm cannot get 420 want,btohqsg

Or they just pluck based on vaccination rate,btohqsg
Know vaccination will get infected. But in this case  it make no difference whether vaccinate or not. Just the seriousness of the illness,btohqsg
Thought they have the efficacy rate to be 80+% after 2 doses,btohqsg
Ya  vaccination is like making those unvaccinated worse off,btohqsg
Being vaccinated can causes a false sense of security.  Need to practice hygiene and safe distancing,btohqsg
Ya  80+ against Delta  90+ against the 1st gen.,btohqsg
The incentive for taking vaccine like fk,btohqsg
Young people won't have strong symptoms anyway,btohqsg
And then the people who got side effects symptoms from vaccine also from young people,btohqsg

Your Morning Quick Read – 24 July 2021It has become one of the most anticipated corporate earnings next week as significant technology companies release their 2nd quarter earnings results. And in the pipeline is Tesla  which will report on Monday  after the market closes.Let’s run through what we can expect.The result will be complicated on multiple fontsThe earnings report is likely to be a complex puzzle as the bears and bulls fight for the direction of the stocks. The estimation is for Tesla to report about 94 cents per share in earnings with sales of $11.5 billion. We would usually need to see Tesla hitting above this target for meaningful upside swing.The variables are wideThe automobile industry has been facing many uncertainty and headwinds. This would also surface in Tesla’s earning. First  we have a semiconductor shortage that is impairing the supply of Tesla cards. Next  vehicle pricing and vehicle profit margins are hit  given a relatively young recovery phase of the economy. And finally  investors will review Tesla’s battery storage business.To sum up  Tesla will need an apparent breakthrough in its operating profit to allow the stocks to escape from their current range.**How has Tesla stocks performed thus far?**In 2020 third quarter  we saw Tesla reporting an operating profit of $800 million  and this saw the stock price jumped by more than doubled to around $860 within 3 months. However  when the operating profit growth moderates towards the subsequent quarters  investors start to offload its shares  and it has come down to the $640 region. Therefore  profit stagnation appears to have a significant influence on Tesla’s equity price.Nonetheless. things are rosy in investors’ minds. They expect a record-breaking operating profit of around $835 million for the 2nd quarter  underpinned by solid deliveries. If we look back at the recent deliveries  the 2nd quarter of 2021 is the first time Tesla had delivered more than 200 000 vehicles in one quarter. That’s a feat of achievement.The bulls and bears argumentsWhen the results are released  the common theme is the fight over the representation and interpretation of the results. Two key factors are critical in the discussion. The first is how Tesla generates its sales by selling the regulatory credits. In the first quarter  Tesla generated about $518 million in credit sales  which had boosted Tesla’s earnings. Eventually  this credits sale will die down as more legacy car brands start to sell their own EVs.Then we have the Bitcoins concern. Tesla did recognize some gains on their Bitcoin holdings during the first quarter results. However  the cryptocurrency has since then plunged by half from its April peak. This means that we could expect a slight loss to hit the bottom line.And finally  the weak news from Tesla’s new German plant will be a concern coupled with its Austin  Texas facility. The Austin plant is meant for Cybertruck production. And with this production concerns comes its lucrative driver-assistance functions where it has begun selling that software in a subscription model. Then  Tesla might have to provide more information on how it can make money from its charging network  as Elon Musk tweeted on opening the infrastructure to competing EV car brands.The earnings conference will be the highlight  and the fate lies in the details and metrics. But  for investors  it will be the beginning with an end destination in mind for Tesla’s future.It is on 24 July  Saturday  10.25 am in Singapore. Pika World wishes all a sunny and safe weekend.,btohqsg

"#AsiaOne#Singapore2 crabs for $9.99? TikToker warns about scam after it resurfaces onlineJuly 24  2021 at 03:55PMSingaporeans love a good deal and will not pass up on discounts especially when they involve food. However  those craving for crabs should beware of a scam offering two crabs for $9.99 that's recently circulating on TikTok. TikTok user Melissawix said she almost fell for the scam  and posted a video on Friday (July 23) night to warn others about it. ""Previously they called themselves Crabber Restro  now they've changed it to Jack Crab and they're offering crabs at ridiculously low prices "" she said. In her video  she showed the cheap deals listed under ""Crab Delivery Singapore"" offered by Jack Crab Restro on TikTok. The address given  175 Bencoolen Street  is Burlington Square. There's no store with such a name when AsiaOne checked the building's directory but Jack Crab is the name of a restaurant in the United States that closed down in April this year.https://ift.tt/370cCjwMore athttps://t.me/NewsRoomSG",btohqsg
