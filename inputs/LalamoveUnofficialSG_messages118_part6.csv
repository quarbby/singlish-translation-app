It's just too small for bulky items,btohqsg
I used it but cannot carry as much things,btohqsg
It's ok I'm not looking for a big one. Already have a big bag mounted at my bike.,btohqsg
Just want to have a rough idea on how big it looks like,btohqsg
Ah... but it's kinda pointless.. is like 36L ish,btohqsg
A bit smaller than the standard 43L size,btohqsg
Because if buy the lalabag will get priority in getting orders and more filters option. Since I got alot of big bags I'm thinking of getting the small one. But I don't know if the small one Is small enough for me to slot in my bike.,btohqsg
How to let them know I have the bag ah,btohqsg
Actually ok leh not really that big just that the height is tall,btohqsg
Can meh I think they want us to buy from them direct?,btohqsg
I know the deliveroo small thermal bag can slot in my bike but not too sure if this small llm bag will fit. Thanks for sharing,btohqsg
