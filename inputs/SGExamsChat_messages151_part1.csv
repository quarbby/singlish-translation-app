Lol. Ugh. God is just God whats there to discuss ? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ya then blending into its culture is part of it lo,btohqsg
Nothing is impossible sounds like a pop song,btohqsg
Is better to discuss current situation n perspective or solutions lol,btohqsg
More for pastors to share their life stories,btohqsg
Depending on how relevant or helpful,btohqsg
One of the pastor said he used to steal things from his friends and throw them away until he was caught idk,btohqsg
Most of it is about how God helped them or something,btohqsg
There is a key point there,btohqsg
Maybe he wants to show that he is not infallible,btohqsg
If individual catches that it is good,btohqsg
... and then he found God,btohqsg
No pastor meant to testify how God rectified that root within him,btohqsg
Deep seeded issues humans cant help themselves so god can lo thats his point,btohqsg
Actually quite a number in my school converted,btohqsg
Oh okay. No wonder you sound like it from what you just said,btohqsg
Ok lah i listen for main point,btohqsg
Sometimes pastors long winded i shut off,btohqsg
Hahaha. That's very honest of you,btohqsg
But when they convert  some dont tell their parents who are of a different faith,btohqsg
Some very cliche so i leave,btohqsg
Yeah  their parents can be very angry about it.,btohqsg

One thing to do is to make essay plans; find some practice questions  plan ur points  go through with a teacher in consultNext is to revise ur characters and themes; type up some notes about them  find some relevant evidence and explanations  so in exam u donâ€™t need to make up the evidence and exp on the spotUnseen-wise  just keep practicing essay plans and go through with teacher too,btohqsg
By failing to plan ure planning to fail,btohqsg
For the L.E. part  (1) is that the modulus should also be on the L.E.   after that itâ€™s not equal itâ€™s proportional,btohqsg

Instead of writing a whole essay out  just write ur argument as a series of bullet points,btohqsg
Saves time  can consider more questions,btohqsg
Plus it helps u in the actual exam when u r planning ur essay,btohqsg
Same here. Except that 'Ns' was quite commonly used here before so I quickly realised it meant N level. Not sure if it refers to both NA and NT or one of them,btohqsg
Oh? I thought NA and NT exam papers were different. Then why have two different streams?,btohqsg
But NA more difficult than NY,btohqsg
