"But that still doesn't explain how a 718 and 911 are ""girl cars""",btohqsg
I like Mini Cooper design. Damn macho.,btohqsg
Like that.. every car on the road is major pu55 for you sir,btohqsg
Maybe Mr Pete should bid for the plate SPU88Y next time,btohqsg
Everyone around him will be called one then,btohqsg
I watched Italian job. Loved the cars there,btohqsg
Nope only 911 for the amount u paid u get a sissy design,btohqsg
No need to put in effort,btohqsg
Can lift so much gold what else does 1 need,btohqsg
We are talking design or price tag now,btohqsg
Nope failed design n shortchange is different,btohqsg
Can fit people comfortably  parking easy  can drive fast,btohqsg
have u sat in a 992,btohqsg
it beats all ur lambo and ferrari flat,btohqsg
Tbh my taste is very good,btohqsg
Self praise is no praise my mummy always say to me,btohqsg
Porsche small sports car look sissy n kiddy,btohqsg
My mother say never praise yourself  not nice to do,btohqsg
fastest car on the track is 911 GT2RS MR,btohqsg
Oh wow Mr Anwo  your mummy say the same thing as mine,btohqsg
by any chance u two have the same mummy?,btohqsg
There’s something wrong with Porsche designer,btohqsg
You're my long lost brother 🥹🥹🥹,btohqsg
If there’s something wrong  it won’t be a car which the world loves through multiple iterations of it,btohqsg
911 has been the most distinguishable car for years,btohqsg
u see a 911 in 1970s and u see the 992,btohqsg
Ur world is the only world lol,btohqsg
It is starting to sound like… you are minority sir. Which means.. maybe you are the one having bad taste,btohqsg
U all really have no taste,btohqsg
Pay so much for such sissy n kiddy design,btohqsg
Mr Pete's logic seems to be that if you pay 500k for car you must get 500k worth of design,btohqsg
But the Porsche design only worth like 5k,btohqsg
The same world we are in. Just do a quick search on the car sites of any country to see value of Porsches?,btohqsg
So if its a homage to a old design  there's basically been no designing so what's the price for,btohqsg
are you implying ur car has a better design,btohqsg
where is the aventador 50 years ago?,btohqsg
But you never answer where the best laksa is according to you,btohqsg
i heard they are stopping the aventador,btohqsg
yeah i still waiting for this recco,btohqsg
I say Porsche ugly really break some of the glass hearts here even though they hv no Porsche,btohqsg
eat full full sleep happy happy,btohqsg
😂😂😂😂 oh no! crying in my porsche😢😢😢,btohqsg
Aventador also need to do bbk ah? Lambo never give big brakes? Wah#shortchanged,btohqsg

Cause they want let everyone try fd,btohqsg
Now I got like 5 cars,btohqsg

I want to set as my wallpaper,btohqsg
i want to appreciate his anventador,btohqsg
Aiya u all can buy ugly 911 then say la,btohqsg

Lol we can react all we want. LTA and TP will just ignore us,btohqsg
i originally wanted to buy this,btohqsg
Mr Pete got so many cars,btohqsg
He said best design and best car ever,btohqsg
Even though he got shortchanged with no HUD,btohqsg
Mr Pete  you say Lambo shortchange people with no HUD don't spoil market,btohqsg
Nowadays we don’t talk cars got hud or not. We talk wad hud functions the cars have,btohqsg
Can show me picture of your spicy aventador with HUD?,btohqsg
If u tell me ur car has no hud  I will just say “errrrrrrrrr  oooooooo kkkkkkk”,btohqsg
give him some time  need to search from google images,btohqsg
Ok but you say your car has  I wanna see,btohqsg
Good luck  Lambo with HUD will be as hard as finding Bluetooth rims was for Mr Anwo,btohqsg
When you got the car in your driveway,btohqsg
Do u now agree 911 is a ugly sissy kiddy car?,btohqsg
No but I can appreciate multiple cars I think,btohqsg
If u give me a macan… I don’t mind driving,btohqsg
The other day walking around I found a few nice big SUVs,btohqsg
Give u Macan  u will drool over cayenne,btohqsg
to own 2 big and imposing suvs?,btohqsg
G63 is the way to go,btohqsg
Wonder how g63 go to those tight or low carpark,btohqsg
ppl who own g63 dont go to tight / low carparks,btohqsg
They still need to go out  don’t they,btohqsg
Tbh the Benz look ancient n ugly. I can’t appreciate this uncle looks.,btohqsg
or have more than 1 car lol,btohqsg
Yes it is an older gen g350,btohqsg
Still has the g wagon DNA,btohqsg
So is the Porsche in front. Prolly coe car,btohqsg
I recently saw a 2 door defender  it's like the bigger brother of the jimny,btohqsg
Buy a jimny  mod it to look like a g63,btohqsg
No need mod vincar sells the little G,btohqsg
Is this fake news or ? Asking on behalf of my workers,btohqsg
also  they told me last time clearing stock and wont bring in anymore,btohqsg
Why do guys like cars like g63? Also very ugly n uncle-ish. Look like a cuboid.,btohqsg
Only reason why i wld like G63 is the engine,btohqsg
Other than that is probably the history,btohqsg
what's your fav car / design sir,btohqsg
Next week toto strike  I buy a g63 as spare car,btohqsg
So u want four seater convertible,btohqsg
The older 1 with metal roof,btohqsg
Wait weren't you trying to buy an old Cayenne or boxster to show off?,btohqsg
Don’t make sense to buy a car u don’t like to show off,btohqsg
Why am I related to him?,btohqsg
U just need to reply this,btohqsg
Any question talk to my lawyer,btohqsg
I want to change to brand new Michelin,btohqsg
When do u change  when the thread… 50% bare  75% bare or 100% bare,btohqsg

The wrap sticker only few dollars. But the labour few thousand.,btohqsg
Sir still waiting for your HUD picture and laksa recommendation,btohqsg
Very nice looking though  spacious car  owner maintain well I think,btohqsg
Roof high only. Backseats cramp like hell,btohqsg
Very true in ChinaG WAGON is a sign of success and entrepreneurship 😂👍,btohqsg
Isnt it more of the brand than the model instead?,btohqsg
Why this HUD show middle finger 😂👍,btohqsg
Think is the size.Look more down to earth kind of person who drives G Wagon.If you drive 2 door Supercar more like spoil brats  womenizer etc,btohqsg
Sunset way😅 go vet or polypets😂👍,btohqsg
The G makes the cayenne looks midget 😂,btohqsg
ferrari cali is a very VERY outdated car,btohqsg
way less reliable than a porsche,btohqsg
the car is dog sh!t for its price,btohqsg
True. July onwards I think.Malaysia plate cannot every goes into SG. Saw in tiktok,btohqsg
sat in cali and 911 many times and every single time i will alw conclude the 911 is better,btohqsg
From 800 onwards.Disadvantages will have slight peel off. Wear and Tear.,btohqsg
few thousand  my advice is dont go for cheap wrapping,btohqsg
they can cause ur own paint to tear off,btohqsg
not on my car but saw it first hand,btohqsg
Maybe u used to being poor so sit in Ferrari u feel uncomfortable?,btohqsg
last i checked u cant even buy the 992 with 2 californias,btohqsg
Ohhh. I always go sunset way poly pets. Many varieties of kibbles and treats. Many good American brands,btohqsg
i am gonna assume u lack half a brain  992 is the current generation of 911 :),btohqsg
https://www.facebook.com/banleesengpaints/Do paint betterTheir paint very nice 👍Akika Cherry Red very nice,btohqsg
Oic. So just change the 911 bonnet then rename as 992?,btohqsg
cause we thought of wrapping the car to protect the paint 😂,btohqsg
we shall place this game  everytime u say something stupid u lose 50% of your current brain,btohqsg
I think turbo S rly nice,btohqsg
didnt know u like being treated like a young boy before his b@lls has descended,btohqsg
Ministry of detailing for $500 off promo now for wrapping,btohqsg
but the Turbo S is really different,btohqsg
speed is phenomenal  makes me wonder how they are gonna make the next generation faster,btohqsg
Add hybrid tech to the current engine,btohqsg
might not be fast because it add weight to the already heavy car haha,btohqsg
thats true haha  maybe the frunk gets smaller?🥲🥲,btohqsg
Maybe the chassis will be made out of battery,btohqsg
But add a regular car on top,btohqsg
I dunno  u can pm them,btohqsg
Try parking a RR in Shaw House MSCP. The tiny lot is just terrible even if you are driving your average BMW 5 series or Mercedes E class. Hahaha. There are other ways to show off like wear a ridiculously expensive watch or Hermes Himalayan Croc Birkin bag.,btohqsg
How old is the paint? Touch up paint and do coating,btohqsg
Can protect but will not look as good as paint  seldom find wraps that are so good and they are very expensive,btohqsg
Our local drivers and riders also noisy,btohqsg
Poor thing for malaysians that has to travel back and forth,btohqsg

Pops and bangs is what makes our cars…better 😢@Jingxunn,btohqsg

Aftermarket tuning can be noise polluting at times.,btohqsg
Esp when someone is eating hot soup,btohqsg
Buy Singapore plate motorbike la.Many has been doing that,btohqsg
The pop rly make people spill soup,btohqsg
If you’re behind those aftermarket pop bang. You thought your wheel fell off,btohqsg
Burble tune is still ok but pop too much,btohqsg
Yes but still will be alot of damage for them,btohqsg

Thank you sir. It is a state of the mind one which I meditate many year already. See.. until today  I finally found my long lost brudddeerrr @arnavguliani. SGCM really brings people together.,btohqsg
I’ve decided. Those who like to put out divisive statements just to get a reaction  I’m going to politely ignore from now on because this is wasting entire community time for personal entertainment.,btohqsg
I join this community chat when I come Singapore. Everyday got people say his more pull than other guy one… so I thought they talking about pulling rickshaw. So I just go do lor for my boss. End up really can earn money! After many years  I finally save enough to give back to SGCM to go Goodwood!,btohqsg
This was in place even before covid,btohqsg
Better than talking to some people in this chat… I get major brain damage 🧠,btohqsg
I heard about your love and passion for quail eggs,btohqsg
I think not me lah sir,btohqsg
Where is he anyways or am I in the wrong group,btohqsg
I think that was that pretty girl at the Bedok nasi padang the other day,btohqsg
Nahhhhh. Later my work permit get revoked,btohqsg

There is a slight slight chance the uncle may actually have thought he was being considerate by folding the mirror first in case he hits it and it folds out the other way… doesn’t look like he had vicious intent when he did what he did tbh,btohqsg
True dat! But nevertheless  most drivers hate it when other ppl touches/hits/knocks into their car regardless of their intent,btohqsg
That’s for sure. Still doesn’t justify verbal abuse.,btohqsg
The driver's yelling definitely feels quite disproportionate...,btohqsg

Heheh ps i thought you did with them before,btohqsg
G class got it’s special character. Unique.,btohqsg
Because they’re not? 😅 I’m do feel their recent designs like the Ioniq5 and EV6 are honestly progressive,btohqsg
For the price  would be hard to accuse them of … “shortchanging”,btohqsg
https://topgear.com.sg/news/this-is-a-new-2021-hyundai-avante-and-it-looks-radThis CN7 sell so well. My area MSCP has 4Blue/white/2 X grey,btohqsg
Why so? They have good new design  you decide to label it outlier and no count.  I like to be open minded and give credit when it is due.,btohqsg
I heard a few of their N hatchbacks irl and they honestly do sound good.,btohqsg
then there is nothing to talk. it is like saying toyota aint boring simply becauyse of a yaris.,btohqsg
you MUST NOT argue this way. there will be outliers in its own stable. but you got to argue based on what many of the models it sells.,btohqsg
And did I say ALL their cars are drop dead gorgeous?,btohqsg
i am giving you an EXAMPLE to rebut what you said,btohqsg
I am rebutting you because you said this,btohqsg
bmw make cool awesome cars like M3 touring,btohqsg
it is just a reliable utility vehicle,btohqsg
but make cars that hmmm... cars like the dorito shaped 2 series,btohqsg
And all I said was their recent models are nice and give credit. There is no need to jump and rebutt and split hairs,btohqsg
every bmw is enjoyable to drive. thatis their hallmark,btohqsg
Hyundai has improved leaps and bounds i have to say,btohqsg
but in terms of looks i cannot say,btohqsg
thatis why i said it is an outlier. ioniqu,btohqsg
new Ioniq 5  avante  and many other new models are refreshing to see,btohqsg
Have u driven an x1? How is that enjoyable?,btohqsg
Avante is such a good car if u want ur first new car,btohqsg
I30 is pretty decent for a sporty hatch! I30n sounds damn good too,btohqsg
Someone will call it outlier and no count,btohqsg
correct. but one or two models dont change people's perception on thisd,btohqsg
Yes. I heard this one irl,btohqsg
they are becoming better i feel,btohqsg
lets be grateful they are moving in the right direction,btohqsg
Staria  Pallisade  Tucson all great cars,btohqsg
You’re the one who feel the need to lecture and rebutt.,btohqsg
The Hyundai starex is nice as well,btohqsg
Hyundai Kona Hybrid is one of the best EV i feel are out there,btohqsg
"light = efficient   i think it will be the new EV ""corolla""",btohqsg
And the ioniq 6 and 7 looks super nice,btohqsg
all in all  they are no where near german makes but they are moving in the right direction,btohqsg
Looks in one thing  material and build quality is another. Euro makes will triumph japanese and korean makes in the aspect  till u reach the more premium vehicles,btohqsg
I’m appreciating cars. Someone is jumping at throats.,btohqsg
Yes. Even in their mass market models  they have really come a long way in their “feel of the cabin”: NVH  buttons  dash etc,btohqsg
dont get me wrong tho  i will agree that the old Hyundai was abit outdated during its launch and was never so appealling  probably a decade ago. But ever since the new generation has came out  it has always been getting better and better,btohqsg
Yes they were very woody and boxy back then,btohqsg
Why dont SGCM have a meet at showrooms! where community members go to showrooms  experience the cars and interview community members on their thoughts!@SGCM_Admin,btohqsg
i saw a probably 15+yo avante in the morning,btohqsg

many people think volvo are boring LOL  which i partially agree,btohqsg
I have been saying to folks.. the new Volvo design language has been very refreshing too across the range. It is no longer the erm.. erm.. boxy looks it used to be,btohqsg
but... but... i like boxy too HAHA,btohqsg
thats why i like 90s car,btohqsg
but i think mass market prefer flowing lines so i guess for the survival of the company  the new deisgn would suffice,btohqsg
plus its one of the best designs in my opinion,btohqsg
yes. cut lines  shoulder lines  flares  arches,btohqsg
Volvo under ford was never profitable... and many volvo employees were retrenched. that was when the swede gov made AB Volvo buy over Volvo cars and was eventually sold to Geely. Im sure the chinese are profit chasing which i feel is okay because im sure wldnt want the company to become bankrupt. Nevertheless  despite their subtle cost cutting methods  they willmake very good looking cars,btohqsg
the sensible would do what needs to be done to sell cars.,btohqsg
yet wearnes still cant sell volvos😂😂😂,btohqsg
Volvo should have its pricing advantage because the total basic cost is lower  but yet wearnes still choose to take a big chunk,btohqsg
My opinion is that wearnes is not risk taking.,btohqsg
Petestill waiting for your venti HUD picture sir,btohqsg
Wearnes have to pay Volvo Cars the distribution rights and because they sell so little cars  they must collect high premium to be profitable.The risk Wearnes dare not take is to lower the price. Maybe if they decrease their premium for 33-40% down to 20-30%  they might be able to sell more cars. In essence  they collect less premium per car but sell more cars hence making more in overall profits. Premium x Quantity= total revenue. Q increase more than proportionately to P decrease. They can also make more money from servicing and maintenance.The only problem they face is the uncertainty that they dont sell more cars and end become loss making. Thats on the risk appetite of Wearnes.Overall  i believe if they decrease premiums when coe stagnate or is low  this business model will have a higher chance of working.,btohqsg
Also  wearnes dont even have any events for owners unlike the other makes which make the owner-Wearnes bond alittle further compared to other AD. Maybe having this events might help in heir marketing... who knows.,btohqsg
He disappeared after I asked him about his tyres,btohqsg
I am lowkey hoping we have representation from Wearnes in this SGCM community of 3 739 members,btohqsg
LOL i will be more than happy to feedback,btohqsg
you just did give a good feedback sir,btohqsg
you will be THE VS Angel of Singapore,btohqsg
I love Honda. Select models like s2000 fk8r.,btohqsg
i know that wearnes is very profit driven but the newly promoted GM needs to chill on his cost cutting measures. He will really lose once loyal customers of volvos.,btohqsg
Keep buying from them. You’re loyal customer. Buy all the models,btohqsg
LOLOLOL why u instigating me now😂😂.,btohqsg
i will never go into the car industry,btohqsg
i think it is one of the hardest industry to keep afloat and thats why i respect people like elon musk,btohqsg
I hope Elon musk kill most of other makers and force consolidation,btohqsg
EH U WANNA GET BANNED ISIT,btohqsg
Not hard at all. Many will go bust.,btohqsg
eh was you who said#SBMhor sir,btohqsg
u think without elon musk  tesla will survive?,btohqsg
Who can make more profits? Only direct selling models,btohqsg
tesla doesnt make money from selling cars btw,btohqsg
Ford will crumble and so is gm,btohqsg
Really? You don’t read their filings?,btohqsg
elon musk once said it in an interview,btohqsg
JX go read company earnings please,btohqsg
If they don’t make money the stock would have folded.,btohqsg
it wasnt until 2021 that they become profitable sir,btohqsg
btw porsche is doing that too btw,btohqsg
they recently set up a new company in singapore,btohqsg
great haha  after intense instigating u r finally laughing again,btohqsg
Their workshop losing 💰💸There a specialist for Volvo at sin ming😅,btohqsg

u know the workshop is by who anot,btohqsg

Yes the Lengkee showroom under Transeurokar no more.,btohqsg
are you convinced the largest profit driver is from selling cars after reading their financials closely?,btohqsg
Ya. I had opportunity  to  chit  chat with the boss,btohqsg
the management set stupid rules and regs to cut cost  customers not happy with the new rules  scold the mechs  they buisong😂😂,btohqsg

Lek ah bro no need to send essay,btohqsg
nah i think its a good opportunity to explain why volvo are selling little cars in sg if not ltr someone come disturb me again😂😂,btohqsg
i am genuinely fine with this kind of discussions and conversations even when it gets abit heated but i depise people who use personal attacks to prove a point.,btohqsg
it's a good read leh i feel... it's constructive and rational so i learn something. sure beats personal attacks and verbal abuse,btohqsg
i like this one more better sir,btohqsg
Many many mouth they need to feed😂They have too many brands too.Take profit from Volvo to feed other brands that is not doing well😂👍,btohqsg
Community  and especially Volvo Community needs more like you!,btohqsg
I'd really like to see you in VS,btohqsg
HAHA no la dont think it will ever happen😂😂,btohqsg
I am happy where i am  will provide suggestions for the real business people to consider the consumers feedback,btohqsg
Most brands under wearnes dont do well🤣🤣,btohqsg
okay maybe i will rephrase  they dont sell high volume because market is niche,btohqsg
and I admire your humility too. You don't try and act like a subject matter authority even though you really do know a lot about Volvos  plus don't make sweeping statements,btohqsg
and not just Volvos actually  but cars in general from current to previous gens.,btohqsg
sgcm admin team should consider headhunting you,btohqsg

They had no choice.They have to go EVs bcos of air pollution.certain states  During Peak Hours  non Evs not allowed to enter CBD,btohqsg
For sure sir. They definitely don’t make us feel shortchanged by working hard to roll out new models even faster than the usual 7-year product cycles. I notice some EV companies are not announcing new models to keep development and production costs down in an already very challenging economic environment,btohqsg
Interesting observation to that is they are no longer simply final assembly lines with key tech and modules being imported  but with deep local content in core technology and manufacturing.

Hi  can I check is anyone knows about vehicle warranty. I just bought a new vehicle and intend to fix amplifier and woofer but was told that under warranty I am not supposed to fix anything into my new vehicle. Its will void the warranty. Is it true? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
If it involves splicing of wires… warranty void for sure,btohqsg
ik wearnes v an@l about this kind of shit they will void warranty for batt,btohqsg
ehh i think probs only batt warranty will be voided,btohqsg
if its batt then its still okay cos batt is cheap to replace but if they void they whole car warranty then i think you should reconsider,btohqsg
PIs can be a bit more @n@l,btohqsg
And also warranty for headunit will go away,btohqsg
I'm guessing that's aftermarket anyway as in most vezels,btohqsg
