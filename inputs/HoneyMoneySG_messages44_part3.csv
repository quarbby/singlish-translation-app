Hi everyone  what is the best bank to open CPFIS and SRS account  any difference?,btohqsg
Minute difference  if any. If you not urgent to open srs  may want to wait towards end of year. Usually banks will offer promotion to open srs account.,btohqsg
I THINK. The difference is in the cost for CPFIS. Read somewhere that UOB is cheapest per quarter. But negligible difference la imo,btohqsg
Hey  looking to sign up for Kris+. What are the perks again,btohqsg
"Simply put  picture it as NTUC app or Fave app where you get ""something"" back for each purchase. In this case Miles which can be transferred to your KrisFlyer account or used to offset future purchases made via the Kris+ app",btohqsg
Hello everyone  I‚Äôm wondering if you can get vwrd with dbs vicker or any sg banks,btohqsg
Any tips and tricks to maximise the kris+?,btohqsg
Chris have video on it? Use amaze tag with citireward to get the kris miles plus 4 miles per dollar spend plus mastercard deal,btohqsg
Look out for the monthly miles-back promos and most recently upsized GAstronomy series for upsized miles with certain partners.And also 10% discount for some merchants like Gong cha when u use krisPay,btohqsg
anyone has any idea on this? its about 5% interest for first $100k so quite significant,btohqsg
Yes .but u gotta meet all the criteria,btohqsg
honestly not hard. i think 1.6k or 2k salary  and spend 500 on their credit card,btohqsg
Dont think this work  most say must giro from biz account,btohqsg
only the salary pose a problem to me  so i trying to confirm if can do via this PAYNOW SALA method,btohqsg
from their website  trying to see if anyone done it. because its weird to me that its PAYNOW SALA and not PAYNOW SALARY when the field got sufficient space to type full,btohqsg
I can confirm SingSaver is really slow. Fulfilled promotion criteria last month  still waiting. Their TnC states reward will be credited 3 to 4 months after fulfilment üò¥,btohqsg
