but do you only want academic rigour for your uni life,btohqsg
new segment: H1 skibidi toiletyou must write an essay about the skibidi toilet lore  A = extra 10 rp,btohqsg
academic rigour is more important if you actually stay in academia,btohqsg
aka further studies or go into research stuff,btohqsg
i feel bad for those ppl with younger siblings,btohqsg
gotta endure the skibidi toilet song 100000 times,btohqsg
sorry this is what you talk to a person after 3 b2b lectures,btohqsg
my sister don't even know wth is skibidi toilet,btohqsg
i have no clue what that is,btohqsg
Itâ€™s a YT series featuring toilet bowls with human heads sticking out,btohqsg
Am not. At least thatâ€™s what I saw my friendâ€™s children watching on the phones ðŸ˜µ,btohqsg
Think you can try find on YouTube,btohqsg
Hahaha some children are rather addicted to it though,btohqsg
Idk man. I donâ€™t get the vids. I tried watching with the kids but all I see are shootings and explosions. I donâ€™t get the plot,btohqsg
I reckon itâ€™s just wide generational gap in my case when I donâ€™t get the joy since itâ€™s gen alpha vs prehistoric,btohqsg

Likely to be mistaken for trolling ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
i thought it wld be done,btohqsg
time to wait years for the next one,btohqsg
Some people really hv no awareness in this aspect  they only care about themselves,btohqsg
I hv a friend who always tell me all sorts of rants and blah blah  then ignore my messages sometimes,btohqsg
Even when he knows Iâ€™m in some problem,btohqsg
venting to friend is ok but is two way street,btohqsg
My dad ask me be careful of him  he is of defective character,btohqsg
doesnâ€™t have to be two way street if thereâ€™s mutual understanding,btohqsg
Yea bruh I feel he is making it 1 way and it is so stupid of me to still try to reply him,btohqsg
this sort of ranting leads to unhealthy fs usually bc one or both sides dk boundaries,btohqsg
or dk how to set them,btohqsg
oh i meant two way street as in like,btohqsg
Cheap bro 1kg roast mutton meat only 24 sgd,btohqsg
for me itâ€™s ok for my friends to rant to me if itâ€™s just telling me stuff,btohqsg
they donâ€™t expect me to give them solutions or counsel them,btohqsg
for me i generally ask if they want solutions or comfort,btohqsg
