2k still manageable. 5k is almost 1 year worth of petrol,btohqsg

the higher the more road tax,btohqsg
Availability of charging points and duration of charging needs to be improved,btohqsg

Sadly  many performance cars don't come with valved exhausts from factory and LTA will not approve any aftermarket valved exhausts. If they did so  it would be much easier for those with louder cars or aftermarket exhausts to creep into neighborhoods at night without causing too much disturbance,btohqsg
I saw on Audi / Porsche suv. Can see one of the exhaust is covered with a valve cap,btohqsg
Some do come with valved exhausts stock,btohqsg
Especially for the newer cars due to emissions regulations in Europe,btohqsg
The issue is when people with older cars would like to personalize the sound out of their cars using legal/LTA approved exhaust systems,btohqsg
But can't use valvetronic exhausts as LTA simply doesn't approve most of them,btohqsg
Even if you do suck up the cost of taking them for homologation through LTA,btohqsg
Many get rejected on the basis that they have valve systems,btohqsg
They already earn even selling cheaper,btohqsg
now corolla already 140k I think . so for a 7 seater it's relatively cheapüòÇ,btohqsg
alot still buy .. I dun understand...,btohqsg
Altis hybrid already selling close to $200k,btohqsg
The ones who buy cars now are the real rich ones,btohqsg
Even buy Honda jazz  also rich,btohqsg
Willing to spend a better description,btohqsg
With so many car rental  bluesg etc‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think is no choice,btohqsg
There is no such thing as no choice  it's a matter of wise or not wise,btohqsg
There are parents with two three kids  without car  and traveling on public transport‚Ä¶ even though they can afford buying cars,btohqsg
some is peer pressure ... when Ur frens relatives start buying car. u aso want n must buy bigger one. cannot lose face,btohqsg
There is.I used to rent on GetGoDifficult to get a car available near your house.Car has cigarette üö¨ smell.Book taxi  taxi uncle smoke in call. Told me on break.Buaytahan. Go buy my own car.,btohqsg

"On this  this comparison that most people make has a lot of inherent flaws.1. The whole theory assumes that you are only commuting to and from work with no additional trips2. It does not take into account surge in prices during peak hours when most head to and from work  most of the time trips from popular residential areas in the east and west to CBD or thereabouts can cost upwards of 35 dollars in the mornings.3. This brings in the third flaw i.e. the comparison almost always assumes that you are relatively close to your workplace  how about those who live in the west and work in the east?Now for the qualitative factors that can't be accounted for in this comparison.1. What if your work is of a nature where you need to be on the move throughout the day and make multiple trips from one place to another? The grab cost does keep adding up2. Adding onto multiple trips  for many with families  it makes a lot of sense to send their kids to school using their cars and then head off to work in the same trip saving on time and also combining this into one trip which with a cab would take more than one for sure.3. Does not take into account the fact that in many situations there are no taxis available on the route you wish to take and you spend almost the same amount of time looking for a cab  as you would driving to your destination.4. Safety  we've all seen how many cab drivers drive around on the roads these days and the number of near misses or accidents that take place involving phvs. This factor cannot be quantified whatsoever5. Having little kids or a bigger family is something to consider as well as bigger taxis and grab family cabs tend to be way more expensive than the regular onesIn conclusion  many use this comparison and have been using it for many years to criticize vehicle owners in Singapore without looking into the reasons of why most own cars in Singapore. Most own them due to the passion for cars or the convenience they bring about as compared to taking cabs everywhere. And one must remember when criticizing ""Rich Singaporeans"" for buying cars instead of taking taxis  the same COE that these cars use are used by the cabs and as you increase demand for cabs  more cabs on the road  COE will increase alongside that too.",btohqsg
Many drivers are cash poor but they are resourceful. They find part time delivery jobs to cover costüëç,btohqsg
Those office desk bound where got time,btohqsg
True  I rent out my car to collect $ too,btohqsg
Can morning & evening hitch.Weekend before family wakes up do food delivery or rent out car weekday on drivelah.Car advertisement decal. Can get some money tooIf Is there is will  there is a way.,btohqsg

Since Covid  I don‚Äôt dare to hitch liao,btohqsg
hitch 10 maybe 1 is real beautyüòÇ,btohqsg
Now car price good... sell and take public transport,btohqsg
but beautiful ones usually very stuck up,btohqsg
If drive Ferrari  no need to hitch,btohqsg
Yes Mr Xun  really is an issue. And many taxi drivers have also come down to outright refusing flag downs nowadays as well to be able to secure bookings on apps like grab  Gojek  zig  etc. so you can't rely on flagging down regular taxis as well. And finding one on these apps now is really a task and there is no consistency in terms of availability as well. Also if it rains  half the taxis somehow disappear and for whatever you get  you pay double  sometimes triple the regular price,btohqsg
very true. even if you bald n fat. many gold diggers will still stick to u like honey,btohqsg
u lose twice as much when u rent compared to taking grab,btohqsg
If i can get rich after becoming bald and fat  i won't mind,btohqsg
u lose twice as much owning a car now compared to renting,btohqsg
I did have bad experience.Went A&E for gym accident  treated as sprain back. No X-rayGiven medicine and NC. Go back and rest.

Lye on the floor and refuse to move.constant pain for 1 mth.Fractured L4 spine  found out after seeking 2nd opinion at SGH orthopaedic. üòÖ,btohqsg
Depends on what you rent also  many rentals end up being more expensive than your monthly payments on a car you buy  especially if you have them for a longer term,btohqsg
Okay rent small car only haha,btohqsg
Market now for new cars really bad  but used cars still can get by. Inflated pricing for sure  but still better off than new,btohqsg
Now I go hospital. I geng untill specialist. Do all check.üòÇBe safe than sorry üòÇ,btohqsg
Although one shouldn't be buying cars in this financial climate ideally  all the signals point to an impending crisis  best to hold and keep that money liquid,btohqsg
Aiyo Mr Aaron i hope you are feeling better,btohqsg
My mom had a car accident and broke her leg. Surgery at KTPH but took very long to heal  after went TTSH for a different follow up appointment they said got bone fragment that didn't remove during the first surgery,btohqsg
Sad to say got some hospital don't have the best rep,btohqsg
Mr Xun probably stays around Sentosa cove,btohqsg
TTSH is the best. I had my wrist surgery by a senior consultant. He did a very good job. He got 4 degrees. 2 on wrist and 1 orthopaedic. 1 MBBSHe took my case  as a case study to teach young surgeonüëçMy metal plate was the longest he installed in his career üòÇ,btohqsg

Ya. Bankrupt. Goldbell just bought over.,btohqsg
meh i honestly find it hard to believe tht car sharing is profitable,btohqsg
60% of accidents come for car sharing vehicles flying up into barriers or half the body panel get stripped off,btohqsg
x2 cause 3rd party is separate excess,btohqsg
High excess.When accident happened and If  Hirer refuse to pay.Chase 2-3yr via court order. . . Or worst hirer declare bankrupt.,btohqsg
yeah after ahwile ppl will stop using ma,btohqsg
so far the only A-B rental so still will attract ppl 1,btohqsg
wait but how does it work ah,btohqsg
like u can return to any carpark ah,btohqsg
Not sure.Maybe they using comprehensive insurance low excess 600?,btohqsg
use app to check. any  bluesg slots ok as long its empty,btohqsg
Blue SG can return any carpark near your next destination. Need to book parking lot to return.GetGo return the same parking lot you departed.,btohqsg
u click reserve.. got 45mins to be there if i rmb right,btohqsg
Bluesg is good but their excess is crazy,btohqsg
aiy then both not feasible for me,btohqsg
Not sure whether they have Collision Damage Waiver high enough to covered the 5-8k excess,btohqsg
i also got no public carpark or bluesg carpark near me,btohqsg
dun touch bluesg la haha. 8k for self excess  8k for the person u langa into.. siao 1,btohqsg
GetGo has. I always book with CDW,btohqsg
Ghim moh  Holland rd hdbNear your house üòÇ,btohqsg
i dont stay there la haha,btohqsg
No idea. Thats y i terminate my ac liao,btohqsg
They only buy 4 season pass for each carpark so once all full the 5th will be charged,btohqsg
Saw in fb someone charged for the parking üòÇ,btohqsg
If not why only got 2 charging point?,btohqsg
Usually only 4 season lots with the charger for them,btohqsg
5th lot not regular bluesg one,btohqsg
If all 4 full  must return somewhere else,btohqsg
But the insurance issue is real with bluesg  excess super high,btohqsg
Have a few cases where the car broke down and the hirer had to pay around 4k in repairs because being driven by them when it broke down,btohqsg
I prefer to Spend the money on home hifi more better. We spend more time at home than in car anyway,btohqsg
Whoever that was.. ‚Äúc*ck‚Äù is a banned word here sir,btohqsg
WDFish 8K self and 8K 3rd Party?!,btohqsg
finally you avoided the banned words ah,btohqsg
i think their insurance $50/yr only lolol,btohqsg
I dont think the car is even worth 16K,btohqsg
heng my time on bluesg bo taiji... know liao kakin cancel acct,btohqsg
Their car is BYD. Build your dreamShld change to SYD.Shatter Your Dreams üòÇ,btohqsg
That‚Äôs absurd. Why should consumers bear the maintenance risk on such short term rentals.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the car they bang into:)) and yes I think Â∞èËìùshould be worth less than 16k,btohqsg
Outside of normal wear and tear norms. Unless of coz it‚Äôs proven the damage was caused by the hirer‚Äôs misuse or abuse.,btohqsg
Think of it. In my HDB carpark  I have a neighbour car whose number plate is definitely worth more than the car üòÇ,btohqsg
I think just insure for the paper only at this point  16k more than enough to cover most fender benders with these cars,btohqsg
Number plate those e/s series driving b&b cars,btohqsg
It is a S series plate with 2 digits  on a Mazda 3 üòÇ,btohqsg
I thinking is it they not so rich,btohqsg
I KNEW THESE COMMENTS ARE COMING WHEN SOMEONE MENTION MAZDA üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I heard they from same family tree,btohqsg
Coukd be possible that the plate has been in the family for a while. Sometimes some people do spend an amount on plates disproportionate to their car as well just because they want to have that good looking plate,btohqsg
I thought Mr Xun no friends staying in hdb? All gcb already right?,btohqsg
Can give me class 2 instantly?,btohqsg
But many nice plates on conti too,btohqsg
They have much better insurance than blue sg,btohqsg

Is it true that you cannot update your OS? Heard before that once updated to certain version  old phone cannot work anymore,btohqsg
Tribe car too over their fleet or cars?,btohqsg
Yeah. Hopefully  those owned such loud car be considerate and ramp cars in the day time and no one will cow peh! Ramp loud cars at wee hours are just outrageously uncouth and  reflect poor  judgement of their social civic mindedness.,btohqsg
True from Iphone 7 or 8 onwards  when they started to bind part serial numbers in the firmware.No such thing for iphones with headphone jacks. As such  that phone is a heaven for me.,btohqsg
No matter how loud one‚Äôs car is  it is possible to gentle drive at Low revs and higher gears,btohqsg
Damn my iPhone 7..... Still using but don't dare to update,btohqsg

I guess it'll be much safer in wet condition?,btohqsg
And next to impossible to lane split,btohqsg

Yep. And I only know them because pike peaks cars have been modded to use hayabusa engines lol,btohqsg
Ducati famous for their multistrada pike peaks,btohqsg

i dont think our road hogger cares because he knows it aint true,btohqsg
i tried so hard to like toyota. vious and then camry i tired my sister's car. it is impossible. camry is a bigger version of vios,btohqsg
Most boring has to be my dad's nissan cefiro,btohqsg
I only passenger before in a model 3 perf  must drive to see what else it can offer other than instant torque,btohqsg
God that thing is a brick on wheels,btohqsg
With introduction of E-bike  won‚Äôt charging station be a concern as well?,btohqsg
I find cerfiro a 'steady & firm' car whilst  travelling on the road  reckon its due to its weight. Sound insulation is pretty good too.,btohqsg

Well  if Government policy is moving into sustainable development  eventually  Singaporean will need to adopt and adapt to E-bike right? Expensive? Perhaps  by then an average cost of an EV car might reach 200k so what is 50k E-bike? Singaporean have to suck it up or take public transport.,btohqsg

while there are cars like S60r tht are sporty,btohqsg
Why they don‚Äôt do 6 cylinder,btohqsg
ohh i see  shall check again tonight 12amneed to buy car shampoo,btohqsg
they did a tranverse mounted straight 6,btohqsg
they even did a V8 for the S80 and XC90 that was tuned by yamaha,btohqsg
They call it the SI6. 3.0L turbo for XC60  V60 and S60. 3.2L NA for XC90 and S80,btohqsg
there are a few 3.2 XC90 3.2 roaming sg,btohqsg
i think there is only 1 or 2 3.0L i6 S60 in SG,btohqsg
Like Saab they only made 4,btohqsg

does any one know if 2011 altis soundproof worth it or got use anot üòÖ,btohqsg
Interesting. Saab only made 4 cylinders,btohqsg
You want to further do this? Gonna be heavy the car,btohqsg
I remember they use Mitsubishi engine one one of the models. Like s40,btohqsg
i wanted to do this too  but my friends and colleague all suggested me not to.,btohqsg
was a 1.8L share with carisma,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt do it. Not worth the effort and money. If you want a quieter car get the higher end like Camry.,btohqsg
if it's just the doors? also not recommended ah?,btohqsg
Get used to it. Altis is a good daily driver. Reliable trusty  albeit no enjoyment,btohqsg
i just blast my music louder so i dont hear the wind & road sound üòÇ,btohqsg
How much noise insulation can it provide? I don‚Äôt know. Don‚Äôt modify la. Play some funky music and music will cancel the noise,btohqsg
When you don‚Äôt think about it you don‚Äôt do it,btohqsg
usually sound insulation is very complex,btohqsg
sometimes come from the wheel well sometimes its just the design of the car,btohqsg
sometimes if ur door or boot abit misalligned also can cause alot of roadnoise,btohqsg
Suddenly come up on my sgcarmart suggestions,btohqsg
You say too much. Why not just say buy volvo. Sound insulation is very good. Be direct. ü§≠,btohqsg
It's my first time seeing tablets kind of octane booster üòÖ,btohqsg
Only Volvo cars come with solid sound insulation. Mai Thu Liao,btohqsg
You do door only but engine sound is still there.Roof must do too. Raining very loud like metal vinyl roof from Kampong.Do full car laEngine Bay.RoofFloor4 door4 wheelBoot.Window also change Laminated or Double Glaze üëç,btohqsg
i nvr say tht hor haha,btohqsg
Usually the best way to reduce it is getting sound dampening sheets installed in the doors first and see if that helps,btohqsg
If that doesn't  can do floor and pillars,btohqsg
They help a lot with road noise and vibrations,btohqsg
Other than that  can consider quieter tires too,btohqsg
The weight doesn't increase by too much with the dampening sheets,btohqsg
Minor difference like carrying one full carton in the boot usually,btohqsg
Must look inside a Porsche door card next time,btohqsg
Most continental cars have a lot of insulation,btohqsg
Boot more important for hatchback and SUV  sedan don't need as much because the rear seat can absorb sound,btohqsg
Then car becomes heavy. And driving becomes even more boring. Next thing modify engine?,btohqsg
This is so dangerous. How can a major car maker screw up,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of sheets you get  nowadays the sheets are lighter and more effective,btohqsg
1 800 cc Altis is powerful enough for full car sound proof.PHV Toyota Noah MPV 1800cc 120bhp with 7 pax  no issues üòÖ,btohqsg
Sg Altis got 1.8litres 1 meh?,btohqsg
Try drive up to genting with 7 grown men,btohqsg

How do you properly assess a car with 6 previous owners,btohqsg
Or do you err on the side of caution and not buy it?,btohqsg
Of course Mr Anwo  we are all friends here!,btohqsg
RX8 is a ticking time bomb  dont bother,btohqsg
u will go through more apex seals than tyres,btohqsg
If it is an older enthusiast car  many owners hold for short periods of time before selling as they don't lose much/make a profit,btohqsg
But for cars like this  keep aside 7 to 10k min. for wear and tear and repairs,btohqsg
As they are prone to higher wear and tear like Mr Xun suggested,btohqsg
If it is a regular commuter car that has gone through a lot of owners  don't bother unless you can get a PPI and see that it is good  and use the 6 owners as a bargaining chip. If cannot do inspection  walk away as the chances of it having a shady past and poor maintenance are higher,btohqsg
If you are asking this question when purchasing a car. it is better to buy new or with Sgcarmart warranty.Since buying 2nd car there is always a risk of lemon  just how much time effort and money you are willing to fix,btohqsg
"thats why there are still ""moneypit"" cars around üòù",btohqsg
learn more now so when bull market returns  can dump stuff and buy car,btohqsg
okay but owner count is one indicator only. I have seen 6 owner cars in better condition than 2 owner cars.,btohqsg
what's the biggest indicator for you to stay away?,btohqsg
if they dont allow me do PPI or mileage tampering,btohqsg
if u see the tyres are bald  u will know how well the prev owner took care of the car,btohqsg
1800cc altis 1210kg. With full sound proof at most 1600kg? Not heavy,btohqsg
PPI stands for Pre Purchase Inspection. Before you buy any 2nd hand car  please to a PPI to check for any kind of unusual wear that we cannot see from the surface. For example  sometimes maybe the suspension or joints are at the brink of collaps but without lifting up the car  you really cant tell.Mileage tampering is when they reverse the mileage indicated on the odometer to show a lesser mileage and sell for higher price. This is illegal and dishonest. I usually stay away from this kind of sellers because more likely than not the car will come with inherent issues. Mileage tampering can also be checked during PPI.,btohqsg
Now can also dump car  when bear market comes  buy car,btohqsg
Some cars like Subie Boxers or Rotaries  i feel like once u buy it at 10 years old  you will need to prepare a large sum of money for rebuilt etc,btohqsg
yes sir  dump now later can buy 2 cars,btohqsg
ah okay  so best is just buy those with SGCM warranty? üòõ,btohqsg
ah... so much to learn! Thanks sir,btohqsg

i got a question guys  if my headlamp was originally Yellow colour (old model) and i changed it to white light headlamp  need change back during inspection?,btohqsg
Highly dependent.  Many changed to HID 6000k no issues while some face issues with the inspection. So it's very hard to say actually...,btohqsg
Inspections look for brightness levels luminosity kind of things right?,btohqsg
i think they will be okay la,btohqsg
but uk those E90 335 F10 535 if they see u get the lci headlights they cfm catch,btohqsg
model quite new actually but dk why it came with yellow lightson the road i see all honda fit/jazz using white lightsi feel like imposter,btohqsg

The poll missed out one point,btohqsg
ya i when i drive at bend i feel the car is like going topple,btohqsg
I buy suv because it‚Äôs easier for elderlys to get on the car compared to sedan,btohqsg

with low head clearance at the back,btohqsg
how is it couple looking when the car is tall,btohqsg
might as well lower the civic look like a sport car,btohqsg

But Shd still go back to same reason‚Ä¶ easier to put kids in,btohqsg
