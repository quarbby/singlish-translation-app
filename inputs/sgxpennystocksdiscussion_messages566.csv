"üöÄPika World Update- 2 Nov 2021üöÄüçèWill We See Good Times Ahead?üçéEquity indexes have rocketed in October even as supply constraints continued to hamper many company's earnings as they failed to meet sales goals. Moreover  cost pressures built up  which dilute margin. Finally  the expected upward movement in bond yields may push equity valuations to the lower end.Yet  historically  the best 3-month period for stocks is often from November onwards. According to past data  the S&P 500 and Dows have typically gained an average of 3.4% during these 3 months.It could also be a seasonal trend since people tend to pump into investment account during the end year as they tend to contribute to their IRA account at a single shot which typically means flowing money into the stock market. Likewise  in January  we do see substantial contributions from the employers too.Pika World is hopeful of a volatile but profitable quarter ahead.üöòTesla: Politics in PlaceüöñAs Pika World has often spoken about the intertwined of politics into the economy  it seems to play out in Tesla although the impact may not be that significant.On Sunday  Elon Musk tweeted on President Biden as a ""Puppet for the United Auto Workers. This is in response to the proposed tax credits for EV cars  which are given only for cars assembled by unionized labour  which would have excluded Tesla  giving other EV cars an advantage.Ford and General Motors are likely to be beneficiaries of the bill proposals depending on which plant manufactured the EV cars. We have seen the clash between Tesla and Biden administration. Notably  the administration did not invite Tesla  the US largest EV producer  when he annonunced his grand goal of having 50% of the cars sold in the US be electric in August.As of this stage  the conflicting behaviour has not affected Tesla stock price  and Pika World is mindful of future development that may have a material impact on the company. Accordingly  we maintain exposure to Tesla as always.üíéXPeng: Persistent strong performanceüíéChinese EVs are gaining traction in the market as XPeng delivered solid results for delivery compared to NIO. NIO had only delivered 3667 vehicles which is a drastic fall from 10 628 in September.XPeng made remarkable progress as they delivered 10 138 vehicles in October  the second consecutive month that registered more than 10 000 cars. On the other hand  Li Auto  a rival  delivered 7 649 cars  increasing from September.The result paints a shocking picture of how competitive the EV market is in China. Pika World is looking into further entry into Chinese EV stocks.üìÆWhat's on the Menu Today?Today is a light data day  and we hope the market will have a smooth sail.It is 2 Nov  Tuesday  at 7.05 am in Singapore and 7.05 pm in New York. The first trading day has been a good one as we took profit on several positions  and we hope for a splendid week!",btohqsg

Tesla stock dipped more than 5% in premarket trading Tuesday after four consecutive days of gains.Elon Musk said Tesla Inc. hasn‚Äôt yet signed a contract with Hertz Global Holdings Inc..In additionTesla rival Rivian seeks to raise $8.4 billion in IPO.Musk was replying to a tweet from an account named Tesla Silicon Valley Club  which showed a chart ofTesla‚Äôs rising stock price along with a thank you to the company‚Äôs chief executive officer  the world‚Äôs richest person.News ofHertz‚Äôs order on Oct. 25  only around four months after the company emerged from bankruptcy  sent Tesla‚Äôs shares up 13% on the day and its market value past $1 trillion for the first time. The rally has continued  with the stock closing at a record high in New York Monday. Hertz  which trades over the counter ahead of a relisting on the Nasdaq Stock Market  has climbed 38% since the start of last week.The order for 100 000 vehicles is equivalent to about a tenth of what Tesla can produce annually. Florida-based Hertz said it would be paying full price.‚ÄúThe initial interest is exceeding our expectations ‚Äù Hertz‚Äôs interim CEO Mark Fields said last week as traffic to the company‚Äôs website soared  especially for its Tesla rental portal. ‚ÄúIt shows that our message got through.‚ÄùHertz has hired seven-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Tom Brady to star in advertisements showcasing the new Teslas.,btohqsg

‚úàÔ∏èPika World Update- 3 Nov 2021‚úàÔ∏èüí∏Zillow: More reds on the cardü•äAs Zillow is delivering its earning result  it was a painful day for investors as the real estate firm showed concerns about its Zillow Offers  its homebuying program.Essentially Zillow aims to sell about 7000 homes for about $2.8 billion. This translates to about $400k for each House sold. Last quarter  the average selling price was $370 100. If the latest news is correct  it means that Zillow had increased its inventory based on the previous quarter by double. This continued its woes when it stated to stop its home purchase programs through the Zillow Offers program  often known as iBuying  until 2021  which could result in competitors like Opendoor grabbing more market shares.It was a period of stress moment as the company struggled to achieve operational soundness given its renovation backlog. As a result  most analysts had downgraded the stocks and Pika World continued to be on the side-line before value surfaces for entry.ü™§Supply Chain might be easingüß±The equity market has been soaring for multiple reasons. For one  it appears that supply chain constraints might be starting to ease. In addition  freight costs are beginning to moderate  indicating that the bottlenecks occur to be softening. For example  the cost of a 40-foot shipping container had fallen to $9500 in October from $10 500 in September.The Baltic Dry Index  which reflects the cost of shipping raw materials  fell by about 40% in October.Pika World continues to look for indications of supply chain recovery  which may lead to a further boost for the market.üöéRivian: An IPO of great interestüööThe EV company is set to start its IPO roadshow. The electric truck maker is riding on the wave of a recovery in many EV stock prices.It is expected to fetch a valuation of $80 billion in late August but has since then moderated to slightly above $60 billion as it aims for an IPO next week.It will be a counter which Pika World will be interested in exploring the opportunity.üìÆWhat's on the Menu Today?At 8.15 pm  we will get ADP Nonfarm Employment change which we expect to moderate to 400k from 568K in the prior period.The Markit Composite PMI will be released at 9.45 pm  and we expect it to remain at 57.3.Service PMI will be released at the same time  and we expect it to remain at 58.2.The Factory Order data is expected to moderate to 0.1% from 1.2% in the prior period when released at 10 pm.Likewise  ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI is expected to remain stable at 62.0 when released at 10 pm too.At 2 am  we will have the FOMC statement and the interest rate decision  which is expected to be a market mover.It is 3 Nov  Wednesday  at 7.25 am in Singapore and 7.25 pm in New York. The earning season is full-on force  and we hope everyone has a profitable week!,btohqsg
