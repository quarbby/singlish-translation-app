The red flag of your agent is that the 2nd part applies only if life assured dies. Insurance companies are not so good to top-up the difference if your funds are losing monies.,btohqsg
Go ask your agent what if the fund crash like during Covid events. Who will bear the loss? My guess is they wonâ€™t know how to answer.,btohqsg
ILPs are always instant no for me,btohqsg
Hi Gurus. Does Amaze + Citi Rewards work for Groceries  e.g.  Fairprice  Cold Storage?,btohqsg
Sound like annuity plan. Every company also has it. Another popular type are UL (universal life) plans. Should ask your agent for more details,btohqsg
You mean add Amaze card to Fairprice App?,btohqsg
Oh. Then won't eat into the 1k local spend cap for Amaze card,btohqsg
For uob one card cash rebate  does refund by merchants on the following month  affect the total spending of the previous month ?,btohqsg

Hi guys. Anyone has any idea if travel is an exclusion for the 4mpd for UOB PPV? I've not been getting my 9x bonus,btohqsg
Hi everyone. I'm currently with UOB and have a UOB one card. I'm thinking to change to start accumulating miles.I have some huge expenses coming  due to house renovation and fittings.Appliances I'll likely be buying from Audiohouse in SG and furnitures will likely be in JB(foreign currency spend). Let's say for discussion sake  appliances will be $15k SGD and furniture 30k RM.I'm thinking of signing up the UOB Krisflyer card  pairing it with amaze card.Would this be the best strategy for me?Or would you have any recommendations for these bigger expenses?,btohqsg
Even the uob rep cannot answer my qns,btohqsg
online is Not mobile contactless. Travel is not whitelisted category for online 4mpd.,btohqsg
Serious? Then how should I pay via online website?,btohqsg
You canâ€™t  since ppv doesnâ€™t award 10x for online travel,btohqsg
Travel is not an excluded MCC as per T&C,btohqsg
online only give 4mpd for whitelisted MCCs,btohqsg
Travel is not an included online MCC as per T&C,btohqsg
Which tnc have you been reading lol,btohqsg
I donâ€™t see ppv in this list  and this is for promotion. Read up on ppv tnc before you start doubting,btohqsg
This is not UOB PPV's t&c. Did you try looking at their website?http://uob.com.sg/personal/cards/rewards/preferred-platinum-visa-card.page,btohqsg
Then you should see online transactions are for specific mcc  if you donâ€™t see your mcc of your travel tx inside  means no 10x,btohqsg
Depends on the travel agency. Only limited travel agencies are included. The rest are excluded from online.,btohqsg
So are you saying Excluded means 0 uni$?Not mentioned in excluded list  not mentioned in whitelist = 1x? Is that it?,btohqsg
Yes what you said is correct  but also is not what Mouse Hunter said.,btohqsg
Direct airlines mcc code is 3000 Series. Excluded from PPV online 4mpd.,btohqsg
So which cc is best for travel? I got WWMC  UOB ladys and UOB KF. Switching my UOB ladys to travel for July quarter,btohqsg
u already switched uob lady's to travel? Need to change before jul to take effect from Jul,btohqsg
UOB ONE account base interest is in.UOB EVOL cashback too  for those who put statement date as end of month.,btohqsg
For EVOL  is the period by calendar month I.e. 1st to 31st?. I got a separate statement mid June after opening the account on 1st week of June and it doesnâ€™t show me the period involved.,btohqsg
It's based on statement month. For those who put statement date as end of month like myself will receive cashback and statement for Jun today.Most people change the statement date so can synchronise with UOB One account calendar month period.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn! So the rest will likely receive ours tomorrow? :),btohqsg
Depends what you put for your statement date.,btohqsg
I donâ€™t remember there being an option for me to select for the statement date when I applied at the start of June. Is there somewhere I can check or do I need to call UOB? Thank you!,btohqsg
Canâ€™t Citi do something about all these fraudulent transactions?,btohqsg
Can. Block your card and give you new one. ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
Jialat. Always have to keep an eye on Citi card.,btohqsg
No need. Set alerts then you know already.,btohqsg
It chat bot is quite useless lol,btohqsg
Hmmâ€¦ ok  will explore where to set the alerts.,btohqsg
Ya you can set ur alert to 0.01$ for Citi card,btohqsg
You need to talk to agent,btohqsg
Can I pay hdb cash 5% down payment with credit card?,btohqsg
So Iâ€™ve applied for EVOL on the 1st and got the card on the 9th. Spent $300+ on online bookings. And just found out that they have set my billing cycle on 12th monthly so my spending did not qualify for anything.,btohqsg
Itâ€™s so weird that they set it on the 12th. So I should never start using the card immediately after receiving a new one?,btohqsg
Applied on 1st of June  got the card and activate it on the 9th. Stated using the card on 10th with SIA. Got the statement on the 12th which I was confused at first.,btohqsg
You need to meet the full min spending even if it is approved 1 day before your statement date. You still can receive 0.3% cashback on 11 Jul.,btohqsg
I am also not sure if the new EVOL change have already been implemented to my card because the change was only after my application but same day as my approval.,btohqsg
