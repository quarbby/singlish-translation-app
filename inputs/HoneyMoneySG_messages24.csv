Does spending minimum $500 on uob debit visa counted in their minimum spending condition for uob one interest?,btohqsg
U can check on your iBanking app,btohqsg
Understand that Citi Reward Master card is the best to pair with Instarem. Don't intend to apply for so many cards currently. Was thinking of pairing Amex True Cashback card  grabpay card and Instarem. Can this be done? Thank you.,btohqsg
Debit card won't work on amaze I recalled,btohqsg
U nee a master credit to pair with amaze,btohqsg
debit card can but not prepaid card i.e. grab card,btohqsg

Planning to cancel my dbs altitude card. I wonder if cancelation of this card would lead to auto cancelation of the Priority Pass card. Please advise  thank you.,btohqsg
Why would they give u access ?,btohqsg
You will lose the 2 free lounge visits per year...,btohqsg
Separately u can check on PP website if u can still login...,btohqsg
But likely it's gonna be payable even if it's not cancelled...,btohqsg
Anyone tried using amaze+ OCBC titanium onAmazon.com? Can get 4MPD?,btohqsg
Hi any advice on the better miles card I’m still deciding between DBS altitude or Citi premier miles,btohqsg
No only krisflyer or Cathay pacific asiamiles,btohqsg
Better to go for 4mpd cards rather than these two. But if I were to pick between these two I prefer dbs altitude which can pool points with dbs wwmc.,btohqsg
Ohh thanks! I’m looking at the initial sign up bonus points too,btohqsg
Hello  amaze doesn’t give points for grab rides? I added amaze to grab for payment for rides overseas,btohqsg
hi all  for amex true cashback card  for the welcome offer 3% cashback for first 5k  if topup to grabpay 5k straightaway will i get the 3% cashback?,btohqsg
Grabpay is excluded from the welcome promo,btohqsg
You'll only earn 1.5% even if you have the promo active,btohqsg
I see. then does making insurance premium payment get this 3% as well? couldn't find their t&c regarding eligible goods and services,btohqsg
probably yes but does ur insurance accept Amex?,btohqsg
using AIA  saw that they have that option available,btohqsg
Epic diaso increase $$ again used to be $2 then $2.16 now $4.1 for the mere 200yenNot goings to support diasoBefore 1 Jan now 31 Dec already uop price,btohqsg
Better buy what u want by today,btohqsg
ah okay  thanks for informing. so i guess best option for insurance payment in this option 1.5% cashback would be amex tcc -> grabpay (mastercard) -> aia platform,btohqsg
Cheat inside never put new $$ only at cashier put new $$,btohqsg
Yea only found out after 2 mnths....,btohqsg
yeah pray that won't get nerf else no use for that card,btohqsg
don't think there's many cc that allows insurance payment too :(,btohqsg
I already prep for next nerf,btohqsg
U go diaso again u see the 200yen now up to $4,btohqsg
Due to the gst hikes it up again,btohqsg
This one aprl 2022. Up 1%. 2.14 become 2.16. 4.07 become 4.11. Correct ma,btohqsg
I tot 2.14 jump to 4.11,btohqsg

Hi  may I check if yall happen to know the MCC for yoga packages purchased via online? Considering the card to use e.g. Citibank Rewards/HSBC Revolution. Otherwise probably will do Grabpay + UOB absolute,btohqsg
Best to call the yoga studio to check their MCC then cross check with the bank’s list to see if it counts.,btohqsg
Hi all  I've been trying to find out if the UOB One card is entitled to 3% cashback for travel bookings to no avail. Is anyone able to confirm that travel bookings are not considered retail spend and therefore not entitled to 3% cashback? My alternative is the AMEX + GPMC combo,btohqsg
Happy new year guys.Thank you for all the help and guidance.,btohqsg
Any sign up bonus for ocbc?,btohqsg
Frank card is nerf now  uob evol is much better,btohqsg
uob one card cash back at 3.33 percent goes by quarterly. So u need to hit the minimum monthly  one missed and your cash back will be gone.for your instant  travel is accepted is not excluded.,btohqsg
Your best bet will be at citi reward  because citi reward runs a very wide range and if is not included in the exclusion list  likely is accepted whereas for revo  u got to be careful cause it runs on whitelist. so if i were u  i will use the citi reward  cause likely is accepted.,btohqsg
either citi reward  dbs woman world are good choices.,btohqsg
be careful of scam fake account messaging you pretending to be honeymoney admin,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSG- the scammer in this group,btohqsg
Can always check singsaver  moneysmart or the bank website for the latest sign up promos.,btohqsg
Yep apply liao. Sms me successful.  Hope get next wk,btohqsg
Did this 2500 grab reward points help you retain/reach the higher tier e.g. Platinum?Been struggling to find ways to retain my Platinum  a few hours left before being downgraded zzz,btohqsg
tbh grabpay no longer useful anymore liao  I don't bother with keeping my platinum status,btohqsg
But it doesn’t matter ah.. grab is still shit,btohqsg
After their new pricing model made a few mths back  making it user-unfriendly  there's significantly less crowds  imo...,btohqsg
Less ppl will use the card liao.,btohqsg
if i top up my CPF today  does it still has Income tax relief for YA 2023?,btohqsg
Can't even put in samsung pay,btohqsg
Too late cos it's alrdy weekend  after biz days...,btohqsg
There's a cutoff timing for top ups... Even though paynow is immediate,btohqsg
why say so? grabpay card can pay axs machine lah. and lots food center can use grab pay then earn 1.5% cashback with amex tcb,btohqsg
all these no need platinum status,btohqsg
just did a test paynow transfer of $10 It's shown immediately in my transaction history.So not sure if i should do so...,btohqsg
Yes  but it may not qualify for relief for YA2023....,btohqsg
At least it'll qualify for relief for YA2024....,btohqsg
i think liquid pay is better than grabpay lah. because normal cc will consider it as fast food. can get better cashback ratr,btohqsg
do you know when’s the cut off?I think still eligible  I topped up (MRSS) to parent cpf just now around 5pm  and the retirement dashboard on cpf site shows the tax relief is eligible for 2022.,btohqsg
Hi! I know there are many e-wallets out there like grab and your highly recommended instarem. These are more easier for younger students to get >18 years old.So what should we get,btohqsg
Since we can’t get credit and I assume debit cannot beat all these unless you can do card stacking which I hear you mention quite a lot,btohqsg
Oh yes especially how do we get around the fact that u need a credit card for amaze,btohqsg
GXS 3.48 percent interest ? I read other review max is 1.58 percent leh,btohqsg
Quite a lousy product. Maybe target customer are those start to work or are studying etc.,btohqsg
For amaze  I wouldn't recommend using debit card because the amaze spread will be greater than the card rewards you'll receive  if any. Consider using Trust debit card  YouTrip  Revolut  etc,btohqsg
For travel  after using the $1k citi rewards+instarem combo  which is the next alternative? Not considering DBS woman card because of the 1 year expiry,btohqsg
Woman's Card won't give you anything for amaze anyway. Can consider using OCBC titanium Rewards or UOB Lady's Card for specific categories. Otherwise default to a 1.2-1.4 mpd card like Citi premiermiles or UOB PRVI MC,btohqsg
it's useful if using it as temporary cash parking for few days,btohqsg
Best Wishes to All in 2023 !I am looking for some guidance please. I have to make a significant payment to IRAS (about $40k) because I rolled over my FY 2020 & 2021I was thinking of signing up for cardup and Amex TCBWhat are your thoughts ?,btohqsg
You may like to consider signing up for a citibank credit card and use the Citi payall feature to pay the tax. Citi payall has a promo now till 31 Jan 2023 where you get 1.8mpd for citi payall paymentshttps://www1.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/other-services/payall,btohqsg
may i ask why you say so?😂because amaze charge 2% fx fee i think  then citi rewards give you 2.25% cashback if you choose cashback. i ak wondering if i miss out something.,btohqsg
But Citi Rewards is a credit  not debit  card,btohqsg
Can i check for endowus  i brought S&P 500  how to i check my avg price? only can see the price i brought but how to see avg price for the dca i brought monthly??,btohqsg
Go to portfolio and click on the underlying funds to get the info,btohqsg
oh  i get it now hahaha. thanks! i just apply for amaze card and want make the most use of it.,btohqsg
Avg price you have to calculate yourself,btohqsg
but that latest price is the current price but where to see avg?,btohqsg
Used the activity tab to see the price that you bought it at,btohqsg
yup i saw the price i but... just wonder where to find the avg price.. guess i need to do an excel for it,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone knows if I can purchase physical NTUC vouchers to meet minimum spending and qualify for cash back as a new sign up for the standard chartered smart credit card ? Thanks in advance 😉,btohqsg
But hsbc revo will have fx transact fee?,btohqsg
it should count as eligible spend since it is just like buying groceries over the counter,btohqsg
For cashback it seems mostly the fees is more than the cashback right?,btohqsg
yes  the promo only worth it for miles users,btohqsg
The miles worth more than the fees during promo only right?,btohqsg
depends how much u value miles,btohqsg
Hey  just asking is the hsbc premier world master card worth?,btohqsg
"Any one can advise how UOB paynow SALA works? Is it just put reference as ""SALA"" ?",btohqsg
"I tried reference ""PAYNOW SALA"" but it might be wrong",btohqsg
That’s salary credit from your employer. Usually the reference will have “SALA”,btohqsg
"So the correct reference should be ""SALA"" and not ""PAYNOW SALA""",btohqsg
Not worth  cashback rate beaten by Citi Cash Back,btohqsg
It seem now the best deal is Citi reward paired with amaze for daily use.As soon as you got big item/ travel  got to use another card,btohqsg
On miles side that's true. Cashback side can use EVOL,btohqsg
$5 off with grabpay online or paylater   where else can I use it since jipay is gone ?,btohqsg
Only looking at 4mpd card now,btohqsg
Zalora qoo10. I think u can just google search grab merchant.,btohqsg
100 gift card on q10 ?,btohqsg
what is the best way to pay for insurance bill?I am thinking of AXS with Grabpay + UOB Absolute (before 15 Jan 2023 nerf; after that Amex True Cashback). Your thoughts?,btohqsg
Curious to know is there additional fee incurred when we use AXS with Grabpay to pay for insurance bill and tax?,btohqsg
Btw if u have unused (and expired) CDC vouchers  you have until 31 Jan to donate them,btohqsg
Shifu  does anyone know if i can cancel a deposit request into my SRS account for ocbc bank?I was dumb enough to try to depost money into srs today,btohqsg

If you don't want min spend  HSBC Advance and HSBC Revolution are good options,btohqsg
Anyone checked their RHB and received their bonus interest? Interest credited for mine doesn’t seem to include bonus %.,btohqsg
bonus comes in only about 1-2 months later 😅,btohqsg
You may withdraw your SRS monies at any time. You may also continue to operate your SRS account after leaving Singapore. As for the taxability of SRS withdrawals  all withdrawals are generally taxable. In addition  all withdrawals made before the retirement age (currently 62) attract a 5% penalty.,btohqsg
No only from a corporate account credit inward   not our individual paynow   doesn't matter if you enter comment as  sala as the transaction ref code is decided by the bank on type of trnf,btohqsg
This RHB issues of transferring out fund having issues is scaring the hell out of people.,btohqsg
Anyone received their interest for UOB one account?,btohqsg
Just checked my cpf.... Apparently I received MA interest even though I was already at BHS on 31st Dec. Anyone encountered the same thing?,btohqsg
Take a while for the transfer to OA,btohqsg
Or SA if you did not hit FRS,btohqsg
I see. Because on 2nd look  I see that my MA has now exceeded the 2023 BHS 😅,btohqsg
What card should I use for Grab PayLater? Does it count as normal Grab payment?,btohqsg
hihi  does anyone know if i’m considered ‘new to bank’ for citi if i cancelled my prev card in mid dec 2021 and received my new card approval ytd??,btohqsg
It 1st Jan .. checked the medisave account however it is showing 68.5k not the 66k Chris mentioned in his latest cpf video.. there goes the chance to top up the 2.5k to MA.,btohqsg
More than 12 mths already consider new,btohqsg
Don’t get too anxious 😬. It will be transferred. Don’t be shocked that it comes as a -negative in MA,btohqsg
Mine too. Did not get transferred to OA.,btohqsg
Maybe this year they fixed the gap,btohqsg
The MA transfer will take some time. Don't kanchiong,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSG- scammer still in this group using your name,btohqsg

For Ocbc 360 account  my interest for last month seems to be about 0.05% p.a rate. I only opened account on 18 December and salary credited on 30 December. Is this normal since I just opened account?,btohqsg
You need to wait 7 days later to see the respective bonus interest. That what I observed on my statement last month,btohqsg
Ah  the additional bonus interest is later on? Wow thanks  good to know,btohqsg
"just sharing from TnC - ""Bonus Interest will be calculated at the end of each calendar month  based on the average daily balance at the end of each calendar month  subject to a cap  and will be credited into the active 360 Account on the 7th business day (excluding Saturday and Sunday) of the following month or earlier; truncated to 2 decimal places.""",btohqsg

Ok. So I don’t have to do the runaround  xfer to RHB,btohqsg
Useful if you need to make foreign currency purchases as there is no transaction fee,btohqsg

thanks  i applied citi rewards it is under process. i will pair amaze with citi rewards once the card is approved,btohqsg
You need to calculate your average daily balance and act accordingly. There’s this old post that says can view ADB in the website (not mobile app),btohqsg
The average daily balance for the month is calculated by adding up the daily end day balance and dividing it by the number of days in the month.We will look at the value date of all transactions to derive the end day balance. For transactions to be valued the same day  the transaction should be completed by 9pm.,btohqsg
Is 2019 post tho so it’s quite old,btohqsg
And the additional interest for Ocbc360 should arrive at 7th of the month as someone said earlier,btohqsg
Rhb app starting to get back to increase limit to 200k. Can start to resume the musical chair game,btohqsg

Can icbc travel pair with amaze?,btohqsg
sometimes need to temporarily take out some money so that won't exceed 500 by too much per month.,btohqsg
Any ICBC Mastercard can be paired with Amaze,btohqsg
I’d add to this. Most any card with the exception of GrabPay MasterCard :(,btohqsg
Citi rewards if linked to amaze.. after the 1k limit. Overseas spend also only 1 point only?,btohqsg
You can consider sc unlimited Cashback  Citibank Cashback plus Amex tcb and UOB absolute,btohqsg
May I know which is the best card to without cash overseas?,btohqsg
Anyone has issues topping up GrabPay with Big Pay debit card?,btohqsg
Hi is it normal the uob one credit card approval takes so long and not instant?,btohqsg

hello  masters. Im wondering how long citi reward points will expire,btohqsg

I've signed up in September  still waiting for them to approve me,btohqsg
Hmm I’m not very sure  I think u can try going into their app once awhile to see if u can sign upBut currently there’s nothing fascinating about it yet.3.48% p.a limited to 5k u haven’t miss out much,btohqsg
Personally I'm on SC unlimited MC  as they credit the Cashback onto the next statement bill  without me doing anything or having to accumulate min Cashback...,btohqsg

ahh thats true.. need to monitor monthly @.@,btohqsg
what are the odds citibank come back with the ergotune chair for signup bonus ?,btohqsg
May I know what is what is MC?,btohqsg
https://stomp.straitstimes.com/singapore-seen/cpf-members-have-trouble-accessing-their-accounts-due-to-high-traffic-on-new-years. News say people want to “see interest rate”. I though is top up SA/MA. 😆,btohqsg
Tried again  deleting the card from GrabPay and re-adding it (Bigpay customer support troubleshooting recommendation)….couldn’t even add the debit card this time. Not sure what’s the reason. Could it be because all the amount in my BigPay account comes from referral and rewards?,btohqsg
Any idea when does UOB One interest comes in?,btohqsg
Hi all how much balance to leave in RHB bank to ensure interest is received after 1.5 months?Also do u all get fine in PP acct $20 since it is under 200k shortfall?,btohqsg

i saw chris hasn't comment about gxs  and guys do you have any oponion on this digi bank? is it bettee than trust?,btohqsg
Link to Amaze card if you got that.,btohqsg
eh  i didn't know it before ha,btohqsg
Seth got the invite somehow probably because he got use Dash. I fiddled around with “a human’s” invite and think for now  Trust is better to use every day  and GXS is for saving with a goal.,btohqsg
ok  thanks. i think trust is better because we can have 35 voucher from ntuc😁😁😁and we can withdraw money from scb atm.,btohqsg
Anyone tried withdraw the Amaze cashback? Tried linking to grab as mentioned on some websites but no longer able to add grab mc to amaze,btohqsg
Plus if you decide to spend on a specialty shop that’s not electronics bag accessories clothes and work shoes sorts  you save on foreign exchange transaction fees while not losing out that much of miles anywayNormal mile earn rate: 1.2-1.3 mpdTrust: 0.11 mpd,btohqsg
Trust card is good if a person wants FPG and non FPG rewards all credit as link points to be used at FairPrice or kopitiam another form of currency. Plus if u spend difficult to achieve category for relatively average high rebate.,btohqsg
Wondering does recurring gym membership consider as online transaction for UOB EVOL?,btohqsg
You need to link amaze to Grab. Not Grab to Amaze.,btohqsg
After which just top up the cashback value to grab,btohqsg

If your MA is nowhere near BHS  then any time. But if it's near to BHS  then you have to VCMA before your Jan contribution.,btohqsg
hi guys  are there any better ways earn cashback from public transport? am currently using citibank cashback +,btohqsg
Citibank cashback + don’t earn from simplygo I think  It’s excluded from cashbackCan look at chris’ video on simplygo. For no min spend and fuss free and high cashback  try SC smart for 6% and can use for macs or kfc also etcSome kickers tho  can only “redeem” cashback in the form of points after a while and not direct cashback,btohqsg
higher interest but cap at $5k deposit. good for temporary parking of money since there's daily interest.,btohqsg
dbs is like owned by gov. this amount money safety should be the first concern,btohqsg
trustbank? you dont need any action to earn 1.5% interet,btohqsg
Does ocbc titanium rewards get 4mpd on instarem amaze for overseas spend on hotel or airtickets?,btohqsg
no. Amaze dun change the MCC. Ocbc titanium only give 4mpd for whitelist of mcc which dun include hotel or air ticket,btohqsg
I see... citi doesnt support 4mpd for travel too... what do u guys use w instarem then ? Many thanks for the guidance!!,btohqsg
What is the best credit card for big ticket items (e.g flight bookings)?,btohqsg
Is the other channel honeymoneysg1 official?,btohqsg
Any recommendations on credit card for Low spenders?,btohqsg
I used to be a low spender and I think UOB PPV or HSBC Revolution might work out. Be warned both banks have their shenanigans but they give good rewards for lower spenders,btohqsg
Then do UOB PPV first  apply HSBC Revolution next,btohqsg
I immediately think of UOB $ merchants that are not covered by HSBC Revolution …,btohqsg
HSBC Revo is quite comprehensive already,btohqsg
Plush no fee only bad is 1k limit,btohqsg
When does frank and evol Cashback comes in?,btohqsg
only withdraw: no singup gift bow,btohqsg
Mine time got up to 250 or 300 Cashback that's was before quite long ago the sign up promotion is good,btohqsg
It is. For UOB$ merchants All the Dining and Yuu and  G-Star Raw can be covered by HSBC Revolution .,btohqsg
4mpd for contactless/online for whitelist of MCC,btohqsg
OkOverseas online will be amaze with Citi rewards like hotel n lodgings?,btohqsg
DBS Woman’s World Card. Can the points earn use of or cashback?,btohqsg
no  citi rewards exclude travel (hotel  flight etc) from 4mpd,btohqsg
yes can convert points to cashback but at a low rate.,btohqsg
Standard Chartered Smart Card does spending on MOS burger  Long John  Amazon give 6% Cashback?,btohqsg
Is paying using favepay and shopback pay considered as online spending?,btohqsg
assuming all online spend with 4mpd = 2 dbs points= 2% per $1 spend. Though there is promotional rates also if redeem lump sums.,btohqsg
Hi all. Happy new year.Just a question is/will Revolut run another public transport cashback programme? If NO  any recommendation/alternatives for cashback/reward/miles in using public transport?,btohqsg
Ooh which card to use for online overseas and overseas itself?,btohqsg
NoAlternativeTake scb smart the next Best,btohqsg
Online refers to payments done in app or on the merchant websites. Contactless refers to using visa paywave/mastercard paypass with your card.,btohqsg
overseas (less travel) online/offline/recurring etc: Citi rewards mc+Amazeoverseas online travel: uob lady travel category+ Amaze  no fx fee. Uob visa signature or dbs wwmc  both incur 3.25% fx fees.local online travel: dbs wwmc  hsbc revolutionlocal online non-travel: dbs wwmc or hsbc revolution or citi rewards,btohqsg
Hi  may I chk what advantage does UOB PPV has over HSBC Revol? Are there any offline spend which the latter lacks? Thinking of just gg for HSBC.,btohqsg
hsbc revo only covers whitelist of mcc  though quite comprehensive. uob ppv covers all MCC less blacklisted ones and uob$ merchants.,btohqsg
Do HSBC Revo and Uob lady card whitelist apply for overseas spending? Eg will I get miles if I use HSBC Revo at foreign dining restaurant. (Trying to figure out alternatives if CRMC AMAZE limit is busted),btohqsg
yes but incur 2.8% fx fees. can pair uob lady with Amaze to avoid the 3.25% fx fees and still get 4mpd for selected MCC,btohqsg
Ok got it thanks. The other option will be to use <4MPD cards like Citi premiermiles tagged to amaze? But not optimal,btohqsg
can also use uob prvi mc+Amaze,btohqsg
Omg… all along I thought UOB visa signature was capped at 1k spend.. I’ve been wasting my miles..Can I confirm it’s capped at 2k spend for if I just want to use it for local contactless?,btohqsg
capped at $2k  need to meet min $1k local spend to get 4mpd for local contactless/petrol,btohqsg
Shit.. wasted 2 month worth of extra 1k,btohqsg
Some spending can Google Pay but not on HSBC Whitelist. Best to use UOB PPV if it’s not Yuu or UOB$ merchants,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGany referral link for HSBC Revo with sign up bonus?,btohqsg
Hsbc points have longer lifespan compare to Uob,btohqsg
Hi Guys can I check.If we use liquid pay or shopback and pair w Citibank rewards card. Do we get 4 miles per dollar ?,btohqsg
cease means will never have again or only for the time being?,btohqsg
Can use to pay other cc?,btohqsg
NP  is my one card solution.,btohqsg
I remember theres discount buying season parking through giro. Not sure how much discount though,btohqsg
I know alot been said abt citi bank rewards pairing with amaze. How abt if we prefer cashback?,btohqsg
anyone know what's shopee MCC? or if HSBC whitelist cover it?,btohqsg
Depends if u prefer Cashback auto credit back to u on next statement mth or u prefer to accumulate them  and then manually one shot redeem them...,btohqsg
Paying for shopee directly with your cc  yes  in the whitelist for HSBC Revolution. Shopeepay is blacklisted and in any case the fee for topping up with cc is too high,btohqsg
Sorry just to check. How about Kris+ and Ntuc FairPrice online app? Also can use Citibank rewards card to earn 4 miles per dollar ya?,btohqsg
Agreed shopee if use cc card don't top up to shoppe pay ifcnot no point just charged directly,btohqsg
Hi.. I'm confused between the below 4 credit cards to apply -1. HSBC Rev2. Citi bank Rewards3. Dbs women's4. Dbs altitudeMainly my purpose is to get quick air miles as I'm a frequent traveler.Also I'm more into online shopping(lazada)  food deliveries  cabs  and my 95% daily transaction are cashless.Monthly transaction exceeds 1k SGDPlease advise.,btohqsg
What are the options for either one?,btohqsg
Crmc+amaze  but can’t use for travel,btohqsg
I can even use 2 cards.. For travel related expense HSBC Rev can be used right?,btohqsg
Cashless do you mean mostly online/in-app or mostly contactless (paywave/paypass)? If mostly contactless then dbs wwmc is not a good choice because it's only for online and cannot pair with amaze,btohqsg
Both online in app purchases and paywave which I'm very frequent on daily basis,btohqsg
I think safest will be hsbc Revo (travel related plus other whitelist categories) and citirewards+amaze (non travel related),btohqsg
That's the two I'm more inclined.. Thanks so much 🙂 🙏,btohqsg
For overseas spending  after spending $1k on crmc + amaze  which is the next alternative? Not considering DBS woman's card because of the short expiry,btohqsg
Roughly how much u will spend for the access?,btohqsg
WWMC will not earn any points with Amaze. Can use UOB Lady's Card or OCBC TR for 4 mpd  otherwise UOB PRVI MC for 1.4 mpd,btohqsg
Kris + is use with apple pay  so u won't get 4mpd with that  As for fair price online  u can use citi reward.,btohqsg
Kris + with hsbc revolution will get 4milesnperndollar,btohqsg
your best bet are gonna be at general spending cards tag with amaze Because u would not want to use your card directly for a fcy charge and the bank spread.reason of other card not recommended is all the other card are specialized spending. esp when u are at overseas  u dunno if the spend is gonna gain u any points. In the past the world woman card is the best when tag with amaze.But now i would suggest after hitting 1k  go on general cards.,btohqsg
Kris + works with HSBC revo at whitelisted spending. so got to becareful  That's for@mrDSYY,btohqsg
I saw kris + I think I will only spend on challenger or Harvey,btohqsg
Honestly Kris plus is an option if u are looking at hitting 13Mpd at a maximum.But is the main thing is u need to source for items that has that extra MPD  and a lot of place don't have it So got to be more meticulous.And transfering the krispay points immediately to krisflyer.but no point in using krispay miles to pay for items.,btohqsg
Yup... earn the bonus and transfer out.. keep till when gave promo den tt out,btohqsg
Guys  for DBS points  how do I see how many have expired?,btohqsg

Can check from your DBS PayLah,btohqsg
You can earn 4mpd on Kris+ through Google Pay by adding Amaze card to Google Pay,btohqsg
Kris+ can only link to Google Pay on Android though,btohqsg
Russia and Ukraine and Flight to safety. Where strange?,btohqsg
No. The white list is as follows:-Qualifying Merchant TransactionsMcDonald’s  KFC  Subway  Burger King  Ya Kun Kaya Toast  Toast Box  Fun Toast  BUS/MRT via SimplyGo  Netflix  Spotify  YouTube  Disney+,btohqsg
For property tax & Town council fees are best to use UOB absolute AMEX top-up GrabPay MasterCard to make payment before 15th January?,btohqsg
Anyone has experience converting your bank points to frquent flyer programs? Any idea if we can choose for example kris flyer or asia miles? I am looking at dbs bank. Thanks for your advice,btohqsg

"Noticed every one deposit or withdraw money from RHB and standard chartered for 'musical chair.""Can I check if can do it within 1 week of the month instead of 1st day of month?",btohqsg

I already have 360 acc. Guess I will eligible for it,btohqsg
Better confirm with the bank. 4.08% for 8mths is decent,btohqsg
Exactly. Will find out from bank on how to make placementBtw CIMB also has good rate. 4.15 for 18 months,btohqsg
Too long for me. I prefer short term FD while SSB for the long,btohqsg
There are reasons why I don't discuss about this fuzzy Axs thing on my channel as I understand the consequences.Bottomline is:- If you think it works  go and try. Asking for opinions on a public space is just accelerating the death of it,btohqsg

For foreign currency spending. Don't have any master card cc to pair with amaze. What do folks here think of pairing it with posb passion debit card? What about just using trust cc?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if it’s possible to get physical credit card instantly if go down to the branch instead of waiting for the mail?,btohqsg
Not possible. The credit card department is the one responsible for the credit card issuing. The branch only can help you for ATM card only,btohqsg
How to do automatic DCA with ibkr?,btohqsg
I think u have to manually trade.,btohqsg
Cannot pair amaze with trust card because trust is visa. For pairing with posb passion debit card it should work since its a mastercard  but I don't see any benefits of using posb passion debit card for foreign currency transactions,btohqsg
POSB Passion + Amaze gives better rates than DBS Visa debit  can be useful for people who can't hit min spend of $400,btohqsg

Hello. If I do top up of Vcma today . The tax relief I will be getting is only for assessment year 2024 am I right ?,btohqsg
1.5% rebate in Yuu merchants. Doesn't sound too bad.,btohqsg
sorry i think i replied to the wrong message,btohqsg
I forgot that POSB Passion is now a Yuu card as well. Just wondering does the card give any rewards for non-Yuu merchant spending?,btohqsg
I'm also participating in Paylah shop dine travel challenge  spend goal is $160 so I'm just trying to clock spend then ditch the card,btohqsg
1% Taka rebate and that's about it for now,btohqsg
I currently only have Visa debit and POSB Passion debit cards from POSB/DBS,btohqsg
Actually we need more coverage on debit cards. For small spenders who shop at Yuu merchants  I think POSB PAssion Card is not too bad.,btohqsg
POSB Passion only got 0.5% rebate at Yuu merchants I thought,btohqsg
only selected products then have 1.5%,btohqsg
passion card is debit card  no annual fee so i think it doesnzt hurt to carry one more card lah hahaha,btohqsg
no min spend cards like HSBC revo alr give 2.5% liao  even student cards like maybank evibes gives 1%,btohqsg
Yes  provided you have not maxed out the 80k cap limit,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Just wanna make sure so for this year if I do the assessment I will not get the 8k tax relief right,btohqsg
For citi rewards card  is paying telco bill able earn 4mpd or do I have to go through city payall to earn.,btohqsg
Thanks for ur reply. I was asking about using trust cc alone.,btohqsg
May I know what's the dbs visa card u are referring to?,btohqsg
Even using trust card overseas  its spread is not too bad..For context  I spent RM10 on a sat in dec  was charged SGD $3.07....,btohqsg
Webull if open acc in December for $150  any way to track progress?Since January promotion different already now,btohqsg
i think it's a very goos rate.,btohqsg
If u vcma within this year 2023  it is for YA 2024 ie this year up to 8k. The personal income tax relief of 80k is inclusive of this 8k relief too. Assuming if u hit the 80k and u vcma 5k  there will not be a 5k relief for u Bec u already max the 80k.,btohqsg

Have anyone tried using the wwc onpoints.comfor Marriot points? Does it count for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Really vcma is better than rstu ah ..,btohqsg
imo doesn’t matter if you’re looking at a tax relief perspective  max 8k a year  and now it’s combinedAnyway when VCMA is maxed and you can only contribute via RSTU  your SA will be supercharged 😎,btohqsg
Yeah I have been maxing rstu instead of putting anything into vcma. Just wondering what I'm missing out on,btohqsg
RSTU contribution cannot be withdrawn upon reaching retirement age  all have to go into RA. You cannot use it for investments  so they cannot be shielded. That's the difference.,btohqsg
How about interest earned from RSTU?,btohqsg
Interest earned in SA stays in SA even after it hits FRSInterest rate earned in MA after hitting BHS flows to SA  if FRS is hit  flows into OA,btohqsg
By this do you mean earning the mpd from Kris + & your CC?,btohqsg
Is the interest earned using RSTU able to be withdrawn after 55 or it will also flow to RA ?,btohqsg
If never reach FRS  will flow to RA.If reach FRS  can withdraw but cannot be used for SA shielding.,btohqsg
anyone deposited $$ on RHB for the HYSA promo? after placing 50K mid Dec  I only received $26 interest? like no bonus interest? anyone know why..?,btohqsg

oh  only see in Jan end?,btohqsg
For Dec one then should be early Feb then see bonus interests.,btohqsg
Can withdraw  won't affect Dec bonus interests,btohqsg
Amaze+crmc use in private clinic doctor will earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi all  if u already top up 37K into your CPF SA as part of RSTU  can u still top up MA? Since the contribution limit is 37K a year,btohqsg
Can I check for in-app payment (Eg NTUC app payment  kopitiam payment using NTUC app  ya kun  Macdonald) is it considered online payment?,btohqsg
Can we transfer all the OA money to SA just before we turn 55 so that the Money in OA can earn the 4% interest upon retirement and save all the CPF shielding coordination?,btohqsg
I have been doing RTSU all the while also 😂,btohqsg
So I can top up within a year:SA: 37KMA: another 10KThis is allowed?,btohqsg
Any reason to top so much into SA? I think there is no limit u can top to SA and MA so long u don't hit the FRS and BHS. You can top it so long u have the money,btohqsg
I suppose if FRS reached then u cannot transfer already,btohqsg
Let say u have FRS and above amount in SA. And maybe about 300k in OA. The cpf shielding I suppose let u put mostly the OA become RA. But maybe I wrong. I still 20+ years too early. Only recall from his video that shld be what Chris means. By the times I reached the age. 100% this will be nerf,btohqsg
this is why it's important to do at start of the new year when the FRS increase,btohqsg

U can call UOB to change it (1st to 30/31st of the month).,btohqsg
Hi I am about to relocate career to airport.Did scout the area their canteen only accept cash or QR payment.Last month started using amaze cardAnyone know how to purchase food with QR payment using amaze?,btohqsg

I just change mine last week.. I told them that changing to 1-30/31st will be easier for me to monitor my spending..,btohqsg
Will have to call them again then. The lady didn't tell me can change lol. Will it apply for previous two months statement also? Because mine counts Nov Dec Jan as one quarter,btohqsg

Hey guys  can I check regarding Instarem Amaze and CitiBank Rewards cards?I saw from Honey Money SG videos stating that:- CitiBank Rewards card can earn us 10x points = 4 MPD- To ensure we fully grab the 10x points (4 MPD)  maximum cap of SGD 1 000/statement month  we can link it to Instarem Amaze card.Does this mean to say anything I use to pay with my Amaze card linked to my CitiBank Rewards card  I can get 10x points (4 MPD)?Pay and spend as in:- In SG food/doctor/pet grooming/vet shops- Online websites such as KlookBecause I am still trying to understand what online transaction means.Recently I made a purchase in a local store via Klook with my Amaze card linking to CitiBank Rewards cards. On 27 and 28 Dec  it was already posted (Sum of S$4+ and S$900+  respectively). But I'm only getting 1k+ points?,btohqsg
You must also be aware of the 10X points exclusions  namely  travel. Since Klook is a travel agent  it only earns 1X points.,btohqsg
so it is not rewarding 10 points from travel even through amaze card? i thought amaze can make everything into online purchase,btohqsg
Please watch this video for credit card strategy 2022 to understand the various card strategies. Other than the absolute cashback and grabpay 1.2% nerfed. The rest of the discussion is still valid (for now)https://youtu.be/v5mTqPuvmCk,btohqsg
There's a ton of articles out there about the usage of Amaze card already...It is not a magical card. It only converts any spend into online spend  which is one of the easier requirements of getting the 10x points.It does not however  convert the MCC behind the transaction. Since CRMC excludes all travel related spends  using the amaze card doesn't matter.For e.g. using CRMC on its own to buy stationery at popular may not get you the 10x points (because its not department stores  or shops selling bags  shoes and clothes as offline spend) but when amaze converts it to online spend  then it counts as retail online spend,btohqsg
Correct  but Amaze excludes travel from earning 10X points  even if it's online. Hence  passing through Amaze will still earn you 1X points only,btohqsg
you might want to read up on what MCC means  and how the instarem card doesn't change the MCC of the business (store)also should read up on CRMC's MCC exclusions,btohqsg
ok so meaning any SG store (Excluding travel store related like luggage store etc.) i can earn 10x points (4 MPD) if i use Amaze card link to CRMC?,btohqsg
Basically just avoid travel related transactions with amaze + CRMC,btohqsg
thank you I am new to credit card. I want to make sure one thing:can amaze card transfer offline paypass to online shoping  so i can get 10x points? like eating in food repbulic and buy staff in challenger?,btohqsg
Yes! Suggest u get used to reading exclusion list as a new CC user too so that you can independently learn and teach othershttps://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/Rewards_Exclusion_List.pdf,btohqsg
i think i understand a little. online shopping is not subject to a mcc code but a way to pay the merchant. so no mattee how to pay the travel expense  it is still travel expense.,btohqsg
I will publish a single credit card strategy for cashback users tomorrow night,btohqsg
generally those are okay too. best to read up on MCC exclusions like what the others have mentioned :)one good thing about CRMC is that the points are posted within 1-3 days in the internet banking portal (unlike some banks where u can only see it when statement comes). so you can take some time to track them more digiligently and get used to the 10x hack (while it lasts),btohqsg
Yes 👍 welcome to the world of CC 🤣I just started too  got CRMC + Amaze and HSBC Revo for travel spendingsOCBC titanium next for big purchases,btohqsg
yes  it's great to know the result so we can change plan asap😁,btohqsg
i want hsbc revo as well  but i am waiting for the time when it has a sign-up gift.,btohqsg
Will the point also appear in mobile app?,btohqsg
thanks guys! i am so clear about amaze with crcc now!😁😁😁,btohqsg
Now should have a sign-up rebate bonus,btohqsg
thanks! let me find out :D,btohqsg
YesCitibank shows the base + bonus points quite fast while HSBC only shows base points after 1-2 days and bonus points at the end of the statement month (which is very annoying but a price worth paying for 4MPD  I guess),btohqsg
Amaze OP pairings:- OCBC TR: for big-ticket purchases under the relevant MCCs- UOB Lady's: travel as 10X category  for travel expenses- CRMC: for everything else- UOB PRVI MC / OCBC 90N MC / Citi Premiermiles MC: when you bust the cap on the aforementioned cards,btohqsg
there are cashback cards also like maybank fnf  citi cashback  hsbc premier  sc manhatten  boc qoo10  icbc zodiac,btohqsg
oh yeah I am talking more about miles side. Also ICBC cards can't pair with Amaze,btohqsg
but HSBC revo card if spent overseas got foreign exchange charges right? hahah,btohqsg
i think you can use amaze oversea  it will help you earn award from cc like you spend it locally,btohqsg
No sign up bonus now. I think until 31st Dec still have cashback or samsonite luggage. Will also like to get hsbc revolution. Not sure if it's a lot better than the crmc amaze though,btohqsg
It will still lead u to the desktop site if I'm not wrong. I personally prefer to just check on computer as its easier,btohqsg
thanks  i think i will wait.,btohqsg
but cannot pair hsbc revo to Amaze cos it is not mastercard,btohqsg
Most clinics MCCs are 8011. My understanding is TCM clinics MCCs are 8099,btohqsg
when he say travel spending he meant booking for flight/hotel/tour online/contactless,btohqsg
But in general amaze and crmc really better than just changing money at money changer and spending cash overseas meh?,btohqsg
yes if u value 4mpd higher than the exchange rate difference,btohqsg
Don't forget the convenience and the risk of carrying too much cash also..,btohqsg
Can also consider linking maybank fnf for 8% on overseas dining and transport expenses,btohqsg
If able to hit $800 min spend for the month,btohqsg
Usually not excluded la. CRMC can  so does UOB PPV/VS I believe,btohqsg
Use HSBC revo for your airline and hotel bookings  when u travel can use Amaze CMRC or other cards (needs more research),btohqsg

The maximum amount you can top up is the difference between the CPF Annual Limit of $37 740 and the mandatory CPF contributions made for the calendar year.Does this means if both employee and employer already mandatorily contributed 45k for the year I can’t contribute into any of the 3 accounts for the year?,btohqsg
Would like to enquire about voluntary medisave top up to reach $68500,btohqsg

Spending In Giant msia is considered under supermarket spend category only....,btohqsg
What about? See if I can help,btohqsg
hi chris  jus saw your last video  may i know whats the main benefit of topping up ur ma to max at start of the year ? 😁,btohqsg
1) Tax relief 2) Any other $ meant for MA now flows to SA instead to earn higher interest than OA (4% I think),btohqsg
For regular salaried workers  the employer’s contribution will start flowing into your CPF every month. If your MA is at near full BHS  the only opportunity to top up would be at the start of the year.,btohqsg
Can we topup gift card $55 to get $6 voucher?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if Payment through the ntuc app consider online?,btohqsg
but MA will be filled up within few months,btohqsg
The key idea is that using VCMA to fill up your MA has advantages to using salary.1) VCMA contributions are not affected by SA shielding in future  RSTU contributions cannot be shielded.2) If you already hit FRS  you cannot use RSTU to offset taxes. VCMA is your only option.,btohqsg
Hi guys  for the UOB one account. Will i still be entitled to bonus interest if i withdraw / transfer out my salary immediately upon credit?,btohqsg
T Bill close at 9 pm today ya,btohqsg
good morning guys  any views on the SSB for this month? worth getting? or just stay w the banks?,btohqsg
yes  assuming u met all the requirements.,btohqsg
SSB is for long term  unless can predict that bank interest will be keep > 3% for 10 years,btohqsg
I do think the interest environment have change. It will be more than 3% for 10 years.,btohqsg
i also have the same thinking  currently the rates given by ocbc and uob is averaging maybe around 4-5%. (not including the highest tier met)i think it will be a good run for the banks for awhile. but im open to opinions  i might not be thinking correctly,btohqsg
ssb can always withdrawn  so now i withdrawing some of my previous SSB that < 2.5% but keep some >3% for diversification. I think interest will reach some stable point around 3-4% this year,btohqsg
Most likely not - TnCsCannot do scan and go alsoHowever Lunar New Year is coming. When every week the bill is above 80ish sometimes 150 plus a week … 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg

After getting credit gift  how many months is safe enough to cancel  wait out and reapply?Any cheat sheet for banks? Eg  maybank  citibank  HSBC  cimb,btohqsg
same question  and i also wonder about dbs,btohqsg
Check the terms and conditions of the gift promo. Nowadays the most common is that you can't cancel for 12 mnths.,btohqsg
For e.g. if you go to MoneySmart now and just click the T&Cs for the citibank promo now  the pdf with the T&Cs does state the following:5. Customers cannot cancel their credit card within 12 months from card approval. If theydo so  they will not be eligible for the Gift. MoneySmart reserves the right to claw backthe Gift in such cases.,btohqsg
"And for re-application  the definition of ""Eligible New Customer"" will also be there:“Eligible New Customers” refers to applicants who meet the following conditions:...ii. has not previously canceled any Citibank Credit Cards in the last twelve (12)months immediately prior to his/her application for the Eligible Card and prior tothe commencement of the Application Period.",btohqsg
Does citi rewards card have minimum spend?,btohqsg
Anyone knows how uob tabulate the annual interest base on above?,btohqsg
Once it’s filled up to BHS  no longer have the opportunity to top up for tax deduction. See what’s your purpose of topping up,btohqsg
im not sure what that $200 cash rebate is  but otherwise u should refer to the detailed breakdown table  that shows interest rates in tranches of 30K  30K  15K and 25K (total of 100K),btohqsg
Too misleading to indicate $5002.50 as annual interest,btohqsg
but $5002.50 is correct if you maintain $100K and fulfil the 3 criteria. what's misleading about it....?,btohqsg
What's the cheapest way to withdraw my USD from my DBS,btohqsg
Or any fee less way to transfer from DBS to uob USD account,btohqsg
not really  just that points awarded for blocks of $1,btohqsg
Just open dbs multi currency account and transfer to uob multi currency acc. I assume is usd to usd,btohqsg
Ya  there's a fees for transfer,btohqsg
Just thought if have any way to avoid that,btohqsg
Not sure. I think about 5usd or 10 usd maybe. Intermediate bank fee. Just not confirm as it is both are Singapore bank,btohqsg
I meet all criteria but interest credit is not the stated amt,btohqsg
im not sure what numbers you are comparing with... the $5002.50 is the total annual interest. which means monthly you will get that amount divided by 12.You also need to make sure your monthly average balance is listed as >= $100K,btohqsg
U are right but still even per mth i am not getting the stated interest..,btohqsg
then you probably need to calculate and dispute with the bank if necessary. me and a few friends calculated ours and all of us had no problem 😅,btohqsg
So the cpf from work for Ma portion will flow to SA?,btohqsg
I always find uob one and it's card very convuluted. If you have no salary credit  the optimal amount for int is 75k not 100k.,btohqsg
isn't that quite normal for all the high interest accounts?,btohqsg
If the MA is at BHS  it will flow to SA. If SA also at FRS  should flow to OA,btohqsg
I dont know abt the rest. I have both Ocbc and uob. Ocbc is quite clear on the requirement. The credit card is also easy to understand. Uob one card need to have consecutive qtr spending of an amount to be entitled the cash rebate. Not 1cent less in the month. And the qtr is not calendar qtr etc. I gave up in the end..,btohqsg
Do check out Chris latest video,btohqsg
Ok  so I should topup this before mid month cpf from employment is in,btohqsg
Has ur interest come in for the prev month?,btohqsg
I'm still waiting but not sure which day will credit,btohqsg
As the part of musical chair game  switching the accounts for higher interest rate. Now planning to move funds from SCB esaver to RHB. Is it necessary to keep $1k sgd in esaver or can it be $0? Anybody switched out from SCB esaver earlier ? Pls advice. Thanks,btohqsg
U will still need to keep minimum in your esaver.,btohqsg

hello people  new to the miles game  appreciate some help from this community! i used dbs wwmc for some offline spends and maxed out the $2k spends limit unfortunately. i had online spends subsequently  can I check if those spends will still get the 4mpd?,btohqsg
yes my december one came in today  so did my friends' interests,btohqsg
The screenshot from IRAS seems to say that they have now combined the tax relief to a total of $8000 (for self) - up from the $7 000 that you could top up SA (the RSTU). So  my reading is that you can top up all 8k to the SA (if not at limit already)  or if at limit  then top up to MA. Is that correct?,btohqsg
Does anyone know how HDB determines ur income for the EHG grant? Haha like isit based on CPF only?,btohqsg
Yes  the bonus points applies for the first 2k of online spend  doesn't consider offline spend,btohqsg
You need to submit your past 12 months payslips and past 15 months CPF contribution history  then HDB will assess your income from there,btohqsg
Wa how come 15 months… if no CPF?,btohqsg
I think because it's the longest date range you can select from CPF website. If no CPF contributions then it won't show.,btohqsg
12 month income is actually sufficient  15 month CPF for good measure  HDB receives a lot of incomplete applications so their policies often requests for more,btohqsg
If do part time job without cpf  can count?,btohqsg
Monthly pay is fixed even tho part time?,btohqsg
If no CPF contributions then no need to submit CPF transaction history... More info in the link below:https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/e-resale/softcopy-income-documents-to-be-uploaded-if-applying-for-cpf-housing-grant,btohqsg
If you have income proof that every month you have salary credited to you then HDB will take the average of the 12 months  but based on my experience  a prudent HDB officer will request for more documents like CPF,btohqsg
Ya I believe so too. If no CPF contributions still good to save a PDF of the page showing no CPF contributions and send to HDB.,btohqsg
Yes haha always be over prepared when it comes to HDB  prepare to wait tooNot entirely their fault too  too many enquiries and/or applications across BTOs and resale flats Lol,btohqsg
Haha I think my gf and I might not have a lot of EHG. Cuz both grad abt same time. So combined income would be high :/,btohqsg
Oh well  just take what u can get  if it’s resale flat try to get proximity and family grant  if not  BTO prices are always earmarked to be lower than market rate anyway 😀,btohqsg
Actl there’s a lot of debates online. With property prices going up  some ppl say wait for now to let markets cool down  some say BTO will always be cheaper so just apply. Thoughts?,btohqsg
I would say just apply for BTO if you can wait until it is completed. Also not guaranteed to get a queue number. Best case scenario if you get to ballot and choose a decent flat. If not successful try again until you reach a point when you cannot wait anymore.,btohqsg
There are too many ways to answer this question and our biases will interfere with what we think is right/wrongBTOs will always be lower than market pricing because you are trading your time for that benefitIf you take 2012’s property high as an example  there was a very gradual depreciation so even if (key word: IF) the property market goes downwards from here  you’re going to need at least 5-10 years to see big price differences and if you then choose to BTO  another 5-7 years before u get ur keys and another 5 years MOP to upgradeMy personal opinion: if you want to BTO  do it early  if not  just go for resale and maximise grants  unless you’re perfectly comfortable with trading the time in your later years,btohqsg
Hello  I have been rejected for cc application due to bad credit ratings and unable to open a bank account via online. Is it a good idea to open a bank account via the branch and make it a salary crediting account to build “relationship” with the bank so in future if I were to apply cc again  is there any higher chance of successful application?,btohqsg
Yup also your salary tends to increase over time and this may eventually disqualify you from grants,btohqsg
really solid advice hahah. thank you. So maybe I can give some context.I just graduated in December and will be starting FT job in july w an above average pay. GF is graduating in May 2023 but havent found a job yet.With our combined income  i’m giving a safe est of 8-9k so almost no EHG grant le. Considering the fact that EHG requires 12 months of income… I was thinking of working from now till Jun w a lower pay job to lower the avg income. but i kinda have trouble finding job now haha,btohqsg
You might want to refer to the following link to understand what CBS looks at when determining your credit score:https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/credit-score.html,btohqsg
Yup I have looked at my own credit score. I am wondering is there any point for me to open their bank account to build their internal credit score? I believe they not just looking at CBS alone,btohqsg
Congrats! Haha welcome to the working world!As long as you can draw income for 12 months without any breaks in between  the income average can still be considered for EHG,btohqsg
Thank you thank you haha.My thought process is this…Aug22 BTO -> Assess income End22Nov22 BTO -> Assess income Start23So this 2 window will “maximize” my EHG if i find a part time job from Jan22-Jun22 to avg down my FT pay from Jul22-Dec22.Which is why i’m kinda restricting myself to the Aug22/Nov22 applications.or am I playing with too many assumptions alrdy? Just apply? haha,btohqsg
Ok I wasn’t sure if you were planning to BTO or resaleSince you mentioned BTO  you can actually just apply as soon as possible because it’s not easy to secure a flat of your choice  then do deferred income assessmentread here:https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/booking-of-flat,btohqsg
And yes too many assumptions already I have had too many friends try 4-7 times with unfavourable queue numbers just go for it!!,btohqsg
ah icic… If i’m open to resale/SBF  would my strategy change?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if uob cards add to amaze will get rewards???,btohqsg
wondering amex true cashback has signup gift before? i saw all amex cc has a signup gift excluding this one😂,btohqsg
Need at least 12 months of employment so you’d have to work first 😅,btohqsg
Yes  (good) relationship with bank could help. But if CB score is not ideal  then no matter how good your conduct with the bank is  would not make much of a difference. CB score is critical.,btohqsg
BTO’s call for first appointment seems to be between 4-7 months depending on queue number,btohqsg
ah… so either way  very hard to time the income assessment… i see. Thanks so much bro. You gave me alot of clarity,btohqsg
First home is very exciting 😁 wish u all the best,btohqsg
This is so useful! For potential home buyers out there! :)),btohqsg
Ok I understood. Hopefully overtime CBS will improve. Thank you.,btohqsg
Any card that gives rewards for toping up bigpay?,btohqsg
hello  im wondering how long it will take for the citi credit card application process.,btohqsg

Ya as far as I know it is ok,btohqsg

If you're a miles guy i suggest to go for it since it covers most everyday spend.. if cashback  see what your spending is like cause most other cards will need a min spend and can give better cashback. (the points for HSBC revo are converted on a 2.5% IIRC),btohqsg

Risk is tomorrow they nerf axs payment,btohqsg
I must say the new video from Chris has got me very interested in HSBC now,btohqsg
But I go direct deduct from grab card so no need to use axs,btohqsg
Insurance can direct? Then ok lo,btohqsg
Oh you're right. Insurance cannot only other bills can direct deduct from the card.,btohqsg
Still can top up but if payment is end year then abit risky,btohqsg
Someone else asked earlier today also. Citibank excludes simplygo from 1.6% cashback even  so pls get the sc smart card lol,btohqsg
I guess the 6% best cb on mrt and bus right?,btohqsg
I know some cashback/miles cards are higher %  but as for no min spend and no annual fees  this is as good as it gets. Can get cashback for fastfood like kfc and macs and got sweet signup gifts on singsaver/money smart so nth to loseChris also did a video on this if you wanna refer ^,btohqsg

Dear gurus - what is the best cashback strategy for paying insurance premiums?,btohqsg
Recurring or one-off? Recurring use Maybank Plat Visa. One-off use Amex TCB top up GPMC,btohqsg
I used it to pay for air ticket but because flying out from France so the ticket is charged in EUR.,btohqsg
1 SGD now is 0.7 Eurobut factor in 1% cash back and also credit card reward,btohqsg
If I have Citi rewards card  which excludes rewards for bus/mrt (4111)If I pair it with amaze card  am I able to earn the x10 points?,btohqsg
Amaze doesn't make item from excluded become included. It only change offline to online. The underlying MCC code need to be valid and not excluded,btohqsg
so roughly 2.5% fx fee  a little high eh.,btohqsg
but if you pair it with citi cashback+  then you will have 1%+1.6% cashback  think it acceptable lah,btohqsg
What are the mile credit card that I can use for bus/mrt?,btohqsg
It is recurring. Thanks. Let me check it out.,btohqsg

Hi guys  i’m looking to open a UOB one account for the higher interest rate  any idea if monthly payment for  insurance counts under the $500 spendings?,btohqsg
Wanting to know for my knowledge:Person has two saving accounts one with DBS and one with UOB. Each account has a balance of 100K  how much money is insured by SDIC ? 75K or 150K,btohqsg
75k per acc holder for SGD deposit. If you have 65k in a saving acc with bank A and 25k in fd with bank A  only 75k is insured.,btohqsg
So for my example — 75K is insured per bank — so total of 150K is insured,btohqsg
May i know which cash-back card will you guys recommend for petrol?,btohqsg
Do you have a station you normally pump at?,btohqsg
Uob one or Citi Cash Back,btohqsg
How come is 1%+1.6%? I know Citi gives 1.6% but Amaze don't give 1% anymore for foreign spending.,btohqsg
Amaze give instapoints for foreign spend  which can be converted to cashback  TnC applies,btohqsg
Ya but max is 500points  even when I spend 2k  which is largely less than 1%.,btohqsg
it is capped at 500points per transaction  no cap overall,btohqsg

Ouchhh means can only slowly use it for payment already,btohqsg
Haha follow Honeymoney invest lionglobal infinity 500,btohqsg
I don't think you can get a credit card unless you have already been accepted into a university. You can get POSB Multiplier + POSB SAYE account  as well as SC Jumpstart. DBS Safra/POSB HomeTeamNS card also good since have 2% cashback on contactless spend with no min spend while you serve the nation,btohqsg
I've done this top-up and it works. JT is right  that the risk is that the cash is stuck there if you don't have a short term use for it.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. Yeah  im leaning more towards doing the top up cause it still makes sense for me.,btohqsg
I see I see. Alright thanks for the help 🙏🏽,btohqsg
Oh. I dun have Citi and F&F need $800,btohqsg
