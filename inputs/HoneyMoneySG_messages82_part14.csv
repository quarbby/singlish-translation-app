you can probably do a scheduled transfer if you dont want to remember,btohqsg
does this mean that the earmarking of the amount and the cash credit will happen on the same day  in this case 31st jan? I saw this but I assumed that the earmarking begins immediately after december  but the cash credit will only come on 31st jan,btohqsg
Hi  is it me or UOB TMRW app doesnâ€™t show pending transactions for credit cards? It seems like only the posted ones appear as compared to credit cards and apps from other banks.,btohqsg
The table does say when earmark will take place by. Itâ€™s not immediate.Earmark and cash credit happens on the same day if I didnâ€™t remember wrongly.,btohqsg
Between 11pm to 4am pending credit card transactions wonâ€™t show up. Check after 6am.,btohqsg
oh damn. Is it actually a thing? or its unintended?,btohqsg
"Yes. ""Your withdraw request is processing"". Give them abit more time. 7 working days.",btohqsg
May I ask when u invested and when u withdrew?I thought snack invest only buys every Monday?,btohqsg
CIMB is the same. Only posted transactions can be seen.,btohqsg
Not sure. I follow this. haha,btohqsg
Yeah this was I believe 30th or 31st jan which Is Tuesday Wednesday.Would snack have already used your funds to buy the fund already?I took part on 29th jan late night and my investment is still pending.,btohqsg
Huh. You never get the fund purchased and u already withdraw the cash?,btohqsg
Approx $12.70 but may have minimum interest charge amount.,btohqsg
Yes. Got chance it failed to meet the criteria. Btw any updates on the tnc? Because this tnc somehow never update. Latest is 28th and 29th promo?,btohqsg
I remember i completed everything first. before withdraw.,btohqsg
There is another promo that ran from 1st jan till 29th jan,btohqsg
Pressing the claim reward button doesnâ€™t mean u will surely get the rewards. U need to meet the tnc which is to invest in at least $4k of the fund but your purchase never completedâ€¦.,btohqsg
I remember the statu mentioned that already purchase the fund. If withdraw get back $4 000.,btohqsg
Yes. I know. I asking about the last promo [30th and 31th Dec],btohqsg
First time use the platform. If never hit the requirement then too bad.,btohqsg
There is no 30th and 31st promo from what I know.There isDecember promo (ends 1st jan) ($4k)28-29 flash promo ($10k)January promo ($4k)So if u did 28-29 u can get both. But subject to stricter tnc of 30 days holding.,btohqsg
The 28th and 29th is the $10000 one. I guess you forget.,btohqsg
I edited my posts for clarity. See if better.,btohqsg
There is 2 4k promo one is 30th and 31th. One is 1st Jan to 29th Jan,btohqsg
No I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s right.Because on 29th I did both the $10k and $4k challenge$10k = $880 vouchers$4k = $400 vouchers,btohqsg
This is the screenshot of challenges as at 29th 11.57pm. Look at the number of days left.,btohqsg
4th dec to 1st jan challenge  28-29 December flash promo  and 1-29 January challenge tncs respectively.,btohqsg
To clear the latest challenge how do I need to put my money inside,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/158457U can follow this. Just note vouchers are lesser now. N must hold till end of promo period which is 29th jan.,btohqsg
So if I put on 28th jan does it mean I only need to hold for one day?,btohqsg
This question better ask cso.Because of possibility of free look clause being triggered.,btohqsg
Hey guys! My situation for 2023 is:1. Jan 2023 - March 2023 employed in a company  with 9k salary2. April - July â€” retrenched and not employed3. August - Dec â€” Work as contractor for US company  9k per month.I've registered as a Self Employed person. In this case  how should I declare my income tax and pay for CPF?,btohqsg
But can I made the big purchase first and then subsequently made $800 spending on SIA products  probably months later ?,btohqsg
yes in the same card membership year,btohqsg
Yes you can as long as SIA spends and that spend within card anniversary year. However  the 1.2mpd will come soon. But the remaining 1.8mpd will come 2 months after your membership anniversary.Some people donâ€™t like it cos of this split of miles  and feels locked in if kenna annual fees.Better read to know what you are getting into:https://milelion.com/2024/01/02/krisflyer-uob-credit-card-extends-uncapped-25000-miles-sign-up-offer/,btohqsg
Omg feels like will be locked in by them for 1 year + and being made to pay annual fee right ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Uob krisflyer annual fee ainâ€™t that bad because it comes with renewal miles.,btohqsg
Yes  if annual fee not waived then locked else lose 1.8mpd.If not   as other people mentioned  for fcy use uob Privi miles or other general spend cards for fcy  2.2-2.4mpd unlimited is easier (but kenna fcy fee).Else amaze + uob Privi Mastercards for anything that does not require authorisation hold for 1.4mpd.https://milelion.com/2023/12/30/psa-the-pitfalls-of-using-amaze-for-hotels-or-rental-cars/,btohqsg
My investment on 1st Jan just got completed. Yours probably done too,btohqsg
Please don't get into credit card debt. It's a hole worst than cigarettes. Always clear as soon possible,btohqsg
It's not on their website. Based on experience and it's similar with other banks.,btohqsg
I'm sure it's not only UOB.. DBS also hides certain transactions after 11pm,btohqsg
Should be $100 if the calculated fee is below that.,btohqsg
Did anyone sign up for ProsperUs deposit promo ($10000 for $88)? Any info on when the $88 is credited to account?,btohqsg
Sorry  regarding OCBC 360 (Salary + Save).Seems like the $100 000 will earn the highest E.I.R. but given the criteria to increase avg daily bal by $500 per month  any known workarounds?E.g. does it make sense to empty the account every 12 months  with 0 balance in the account on the 13th month and start over again from the 14th month?,btohqsg
Do a reset month  if you haven't gotten a UOB One account  you can move there for 5% EIR then move back.In fact why not just keep it at UOB One account for 5% EIR since OCBC has lower interest lol.,btohqsg
Guys   the funds in snack also completed. Can withdraw already?,btohqsg
Thanks.The main reason is I am afraid of the inconsistent monthly spending in order to hit $500 required by UOB One.,btohqsg
500 if you have monthly insurance payment should be easy to hit,btohqsg
Thanks. I will look into UOB One.,btohqsg
