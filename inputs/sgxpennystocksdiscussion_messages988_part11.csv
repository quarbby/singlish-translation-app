WTI crude oil futures fluctuated around $76 per barrel on Tuesday  as traders digested a series of executive orders from U.S. President Donald Trump following his inauguration. Among these was a plan to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico starting February 1  dampening investor expectations for a delay. However  Trump held off unveiling specific levies on China  the world's top oil importer  keeping markets on edge. Traders are also awaiting further details on sanctions targeting major oil exporters  including Russia  Iran  and Venezuela.,btohqsg
