But well try to get the offer first before deciding properly HAHA,btohqsg
Yeah im very aware because my brother graduated from the same major,btohqsg
TBH your brother's advice worth a lot more than internet advice,btohqsg

All adult Singaporeans 21 and above will receive a one-off Solidarity Payment of $600 in cash.For the majority of Singaporeans who have provided their bank account details to the Government  the Solidarity Payment will be credited directly into their bank accounts by April 14. The rest will receive the payment by cheque  to be issued in stages later  starting from April 30.$300 for parent  for each child 20years and below,btohqsg

Will spectacles shop open during the lockdown?,btohqsg
Ur favorite bubble tea also open. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

If the government gives money its not a good sign liao,btohqsg
ive said that long ago here,btohqsg
just got made fun of by certain people,btohqsg
to begin with it was never a good sign,btohqsg
If you have USD they can buy in money changers overseas,btohqsg
U have to be cautious if they give u guys fucking money,btohqsg
Note that they're giving a lot of ppl $  not just 'you guys',btohqsg
Maybe the reserves are empty ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
If the reserves are empty  where do they get the money to give you? Shit it out? ðŸ˜ª,btohqsg
Take ur CPF and give it back to u,btohqsg
Take your CPF and support all those other schemes too?,btohqsg
I might not be a fan of PAP  but to say that our reserves are empty is absurd,btohqsg
Aiyo does it matter to these people at all,btohqsg
It might be a red flag that PAP back then canâ€™t give OTC the amount we have in our reserves but to suggest the reserves are empty. Absurd.,btohqsg
They only know 'take my money',btohqsg
OTC had no reason to ask for the valuation,btohqsg
Other than to ask for it,btohqsg
I question the knowledge of ppl sometimes,btohqsg
i thought ns is enough experience already,btohqsg
Ok from your answer  I think that I might need to read more on the issue (well... after I finish my assignments and exams NUS refuses to suspend at least) but isnâ€™t it important to know how much exactly we have? And not just we have money? So that we can account for the money in there?,btohqsg
Whats that? Never heard of it,btohqsg
singapore is going to be a ghost town from tomorrow,btohqsg
What does knowing how much you have actually buy you or the President?At most you can say so you know 'if PARL wants to draw 334242342342342^34443435345345234 sextillion  you can already say no as it's above the reserves amount'Does it actually let the President make decisions with respect to the fund(s)? noDoes it actually let Singaporeans make decisions with respect to the fund(s)? no,btohqsg
So that nobody can secretly take some out and not get caught because we donâ€™t know how much we have exactly anyway?,btohqsg
Let's flip this around a bit - why can nobody take out the Norwegian reserves as they like?,btohqsg
Then you'd know how SG's work?,btohqsg
At the end of the day  you have to trust someone because they said so,btohqsg
