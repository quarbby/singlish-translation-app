I think question come do you need it on day 1 or 1 month wait is fine ? ü§îAnyway all those cool shit you see on iPhone 16 video doesn‚Äôt even ship on launch  you need wit a few more months to get all the AI stuffs? So what is the rush if Apple also not rushing to ship those AI stuffs on launch day ~,btohqsg
cancel it and order for delivery‚Ä¶ at most u wait 1-2 weeks more only. then u standby on release day if u die die must have it that day to see if they have extra stock for pickup  sometimes will have one,btohqsg
Oh take it as a lesson fee. Keep the order and enjoy yr new phone,btohqsg
Anthony  i still havent decided which card to get yet HAHA. honestly not in a rush. wouldnt mind going down to the store and then split the bill lol,btohqsg
Ya imo no rush. Phone is gonna be there. Unless ur current one is dead and need replacement.,btohqsg
Actually if you wait just a bit more  maybe applying for the Citi Smart via MoneySmart may get you an up sizable reward of an iPhone 16.Just postulating but not impossible.,btohqsg

i think it's ok ba. what's done is done already. no point going about it anymore. just move on and learn from it,btohqsg

I actually just received my EVOL renewal card then I went to kay poh read up again (i earlier condemned this card).Since Amaze is going to be nerfed with UOB cards from 1st October  I have a contrarian view on how to use UOB Evol.What about this: $800 entirely as a General Spend Card when OVERSEAS$300 ApplePay/Topup Suica$500 Paywave PHYSICAL CardOverall it will earn $50.9 / $800 = 6.36% cashback - 4% FX Costs = 2.36% Net Positive BenefitSlightly better than UOB Visa Signature (1.5 cents miles valuation) = 4 miles x 1.5 cents - 4% FX Cost = 2% Net Positive Benefit,btohqsg
What's the cap of UOB evol?,btohqsg
cashback is capped at $80  but not economical to hit that..should be aiming for the sweet spot $50which you can hit with MINIMUM $300 online/applepay + $200 foreign currency spend.remaining $300 can be anything.so at minimum if you spend everything overseas (with minimum $300 applepay)  you can hit $50/$800 = 6.25% cashback - 4% FX Fee = 2.25% net positive benefit (BETTER THAN UOB VS),btohqsg
But what if you are just using the card for local spend and no fx spend?,btohqsg
oh no no.. I am exploring from Foreign Spending angle only... since Amaze + UOB dying ... i thought UOB Evol could make an interesting additionfor local SGD... boo to UOB Evol... DEAD... (but if you are going overseas  you can considering using the $300 locally),btohqsg
