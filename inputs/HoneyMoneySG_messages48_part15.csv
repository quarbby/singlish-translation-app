Mine is also still under assessment  and I'm on provisional giro payment plan. So I have few thousand in tax credits so far  not willing to stop also because on hsbc ega which needs manual reactivation. So suck thumb lose some interest.,btohqsg

A quick check. For UOB ONE  does recurring SP and SPH count towards card spending and eligible for cashback? SP bonus CB. Thank you.,btohqsg
Sp - Singapore Poly or SP services? UOB One Account / card?,btohqsg
SP = Singapore PolytechnicThe utilities company is known as SP Group,btohqsg
But then  SP doesn’t have recurring payments so I believe OP is referring to SP Group,btohqsg
Good! This is the scenario I'm looking at. I open a personal One account  and meet CC spend requirement using my own UOB One CCI then open a Joint ONE account with wife. She needs to be the Primary Account holder. She then used her OWN Lady's card to meet CC spend.Hence  both personal account and joint account will be eligible for bonus UOB ONE interest,btohqsg
