🚀Pika World Markets Update - 17 Jan 2024🚀Equity markets had a tough day  with the Nasdaq showing more resilience than other indices  which fell broadly throughout the session. S&P 500 continued to fail to break new highs and trend lower for the whole trading session as investors digested the latest economic news  corporate earnings and Fed's speeches before the blackout period next week.Let's dive into the details.🎙Fed's Wallers is pleased with the current state of the economy where inflation is cooling  the labour market remains healthy  and the economy is still firmly intact. He acknowledged the prospects for the central bank to lower interest rates this year but is concerned about the potential of inflation resurfacing.He believed the current monetary policy is restrictive enough to bring inflation back to the Fed's 2% target. Still  he cautioned against the bet on early rate cuts  contrary to investors' expectation for a March cut.🎯Morgan Stanley reported earnings which saw a weaker-than-expected profit margin in its wealth management business. This casts doubt on whether it can hit the desired level in future. The earnings per share of 85 cents is sharply lower than analysts' estimate of $1.07. We also saw the net income fall from $2.2 billion to $1.5 billion.All eyes will be on its wealth management pretax margin for the next quarter as investors pare back the price target for the bank.🥁In contrast with Morgan Stanley  Goldman Sachs had a better day as its wealth management business had jumped 23% compared to the prior year. The earnings of $5.48 per share smashed Wall Street's estimate of $3.62 per share.With a decline in mergers and acquisitions volume globally  the business segment for global banking and markets fell by 3%. The poorer outlook for M&A activity is primarily driven by the high-interest rate  a persistent inflationary environment and geopolitical uncertainty that hinders business outlook. Still  its CEO is optimistic about capital market activity and project improvement.📪What's on the menu today?🖨High on the list will be the retail sales figure. We are looking at a core retail sales growth of 0.2% on a monthly basis  unchanged from the prior level. This will help to shore up confidence in consumer spending  health  and the economy.FOMC member Bowman will be speaking at 10 pm  too.At 10.15 pm  a string of industrial production data will be released  which we should expect weaker figures  in line with recent economic data suggesting a slowing economy.It is 17 Jan  Wednesday  9.05 am in Singapore and 9.05 pm in New York. The market is still showing choppiness and weakness. This puts tremendous pressure on our pre-Christmas positions  which still need to be able to offload and has burdened our portfolio. We expect a massive move in the market by at least 50 points for the S&P 500 in either direction  which could put our portfolio at risk.We hope you have a splendid day ahead.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg

The Baltic Exchange's main sea freight index  measuring global shipping costs  extended its decline into a seventh straight session on Tuesday  falling 2.7% to a fresh four-month low of 1 324 points  mainly pressured by the bigger size vessel segment. The capesize index  transporting 150 000-tonne cargoes like iron ore and coal  was also down for the seventh day  dropping 5.4% to a fresh four-month low of 1 779 points; and the supramax index decreased for the 24th session in a row  shedding 18 points at 1 060 points. Conversely  the panamax index  tracking ships carrying coal or grain weighing 60 000 to 70 000 tonnes  snapped its 12-day losing streak  rising 0.6% to 1 421 points  on its best session since December 4th.,btohqsg
