I see...will be more carefulThank you üôè,btohqsg
To best way to be more careful is to read both CRMC and Amaze t&cs in full.,btohqsg
After fujian gang  banks are very cautious. So it‚Äôs very normal to get this sort of requests. Just provide everything they ask for if u want to continue your relationship with them.Bank has the right to terminate relationship anytime without providing any reason.,btohqsg
Citi froze my account for 1 month already,btohqsg
My Fujian neighbour don‚Äôt even have bank account. Just keep cash in house.,btohqsg
We in Singapore are very lucky to be able easily to open bank accounts. My Malaysian friend told me it is very very hard to open bank account if you are unemployed like housewives etc there in Malaysia,btohqsg
It‚Äôs so easy that my Fujian cousin in Suzhou also can open a OCBC account to do money transfers to Hong Kong.,btohqsg
Not in Malaysia. Maybe too many scams in Malaysia already,btohqsg
Hi gurus  does citibank send any reminders if your crmc points are expiring?,btohqsg
Times have changed. Try now see how,btohqsg
Oh ya. He opened before all that Fujian üí©Maybe now harder liao.,btohqsg
So need to call CS to find out when i sign up the card then calculate from there?,btohqsg
Just see your card expiry date u can tell,btohqsg
If my cc expiry is 08/25. So how to calculate?,btohqsg
Do you mean the expiry date is the cc pts expiry since the card validity is 5 years or is it 3 years? Sorry that i forgot to mention that i hold the card for more than 10 years so if you are referring to calculate back 3 years it won't work for me.,btohqsg
can i use citi rewards card for transport? ie using as my bus card or buying concession with it? saw on their website i can get 10x points for ride hailing  this means i would have to for example book grab and pay with this card? or can i top up using this card?,btohqsg
Hi. Is it possible to stack rewards/cashbacks by paying though ShopBack linked with Insta.Amaze which is linked with eligible Credit Cards?,btohqsg
yes for grab can use crmc directly. for buying/topping up/use as bus card  won‚Äôt get anything 10X with crmc/crmc-amaze,btohqsg
thanks for response  so to conclude only if i use to directly pay for grab i will get 10x points the rest of the examples i listed all will just be 1x correct? but are all these considered eligible spend for the singsaver bonus?,btohqsg
hailing (grab  gojek  cdg as far as i know) can use crmc directly and get 10X. if u use amaze can also but will eventually eat up to that 1% fee if ur local spending is >1k per calendar month.simplygo tap using crmc/amaze-crmc  top up concession using crmc/amaze-crmc willNOT GET10X. only get 1X.so yes you are right.not sure about singsaver cause i have no experience in that. maybe the gurus can chip in!,btohqsg
icic thanks for your inputs!! appreciate it!!,btohqsg
by any chance does anyone know if i buy items from those F1 pop up store using CRMC would that count as eligible spend for SingSaver promo bonus? if pair with amaze will i get 10x points?,btohqsg
hi gurus  when paying for hotels on agoda  should i pay in local currency or in sgd on my cc?,btohqsg
They should be eligible for the promo bonus. I will say use amaze for the Pop up purchase to get 10X.,btohqsg
By stacking u mean using promo code or ? Just link ShopBack to your CC directly  don‚Äôt waste the limit on Amaze.,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Good day Gurus  i am a frequent traveler and currently holding crmc + amaze for local spend  may I check what's the alternative card i should apply for my overseas spend if i maxed out crmc. If i would to get citi premiermiles card  do i pair with amaze for overseas spend to avoid the charges? will i get the 2 miles per $ if i pair with amaze? Can crmc convertion to miles stack together with citi premiermile?,btohqsg
You may want to watch this video on why it is not recommended to use premiermiles with amazehttps://youtu.be/rSbZXpIFp14,btohqsg
hey guys  if i use amaze (linked with citi rewards) on apple pay do i still earn 4mpd or do i have to use the physical card?,btohqsg
Maybe u can get other 4mpd card for local then CRMC + Amaze for overseas.For citi premier with amaze is 1.2mpd as it charge as SGD in Citi statement.Don‚Äôt think CRMC and citi premier can stack together. U will see CRMC as points system  citi premier directly as miles.Hope it helps to clarify some doubt :),btohqsg
Amaze on Apple Pay will get 10X(4mpd) as long it‚Äôs not under the standard exclusion list,btohqsg
so which card should i apply for? üòÇ,btohqsg
If u more than 10 years. Then I guess u have to contact Citibank to check safest. Can do live chat Loh,btohqsg
Hi guys need some help here  any recommendation with credit card with free travel insurance without annual fees and subsequently usage of card will have fee waiver.,btohqsg
Guys  is it just me or Standard chartered's statement is quite messy?I feel like the amount im paying more than i have used the creditcard.I just paid creditcard outstanding amount yesterday. Today say still have $10+ outstanding.But no breakdown of the outstanding,btohqsg
App shows total outstanding including unbilled posted transactions,btohqsg
Unbilled means it‚Äôs not billed yet (not in your last statement),btohqsg
Anyone appeal successfully for citi smart card on Lazada purchase as offline?,btohqsg
Did it code as offline for u?,btohqsg
Smrt bonus cashback only come in next statement month,btohqsg
Any idea how to track the annual 600? How to know reach cap already ?,btohqsg
Anyone know where to find uob one credit card mcc list? Cause can‚Äôt find when search on google,btohqsg
U need to self check or u cam citi cso,btohqsg
any specific merchant you're looking for?,btohqsg
Not really  I just want see the list so I can better plan my card spending,btohqsg
the merchant and mcc exclusion list is in the T&Cs --https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/one_card_full_tnc.pdf,btohqsg
but if you need to calculate more specifically how much you will earn instead  i'm using dobin to plan my card spending,btohqsg
Slightly different purpose between heymax and dobin,btohqsg
Sorry I just realize u like working for Dobin then not that appropriate to ask. Sorry üôèüèª,btohqsg
HeyMax is one of the best places to spend on MCC 5311 üòÇ,btohqsg
