Does cardup transaction consider as online?,btohqsg
Thks for clarifying. But to make using the platform incur an admin fee of 2++%. What is the benefit of ur such platform?,btohqsg
Thanks  Chris. How is it compare to Citi PayAlll?,btohqsg
Is 1.8k to 2k on iras tax plus other spending using Cardup through UOB One Cashback (Credit or Debit card) suffice to hit 5% cashback? Can use the same 1 account (cardup with linked UOB One cashback card) to pay for 2 ppl IRAS tax to earn maximun cashback and/or points?,btohqsg
Hi Chris I saw your latest video on cpf I dont get it  if you Rstu 192 000 to FRs and dont work a day more  SA all RSTU  how do you withdraw it all at 55?,btohqsg
Depends on whether you prefer to earn cashback or buy miles at a lower cost,btohqsg
short answer is yes. long answer is you need to meet UOB One requirements  watch my video on that,btohqsg
I only mentioned you can withdraw amounts above FRS.,btohqsg
Thanks for replying  but amounts above frs at 55 I message cpf board and they say top up monies rstu and their interest at 55 above frs cannot be withdrawn can only be used for payout,btohqsg
I applied for dbs womans card with promo code 150flash  it got approved  and i applied for the gold color womans card with Paylah promo code. Since both card are not activated  if i activated the gold color card first and use it for 800dollar in 60 days  can i get the cashback for 200dollar?,btohqsg
You can post your question in the 1M65 group  there are more CPF enthusiasts there to discuss this matter. But I'm not concerned of this issue as I'm more focused on the Shielding aspect,btohqsg
Will talk about it in my iPayMy video. Meanwhilehttps://help.ipaymy.com/en/articles/3153490-which-cards-can-earn-rewards-with-ipaymy,btohqsg
Thanks  I watched the video on the recommedation of UOB One card with Cardup and wants to know more on the requirement as the cashback is paid based on tier and on quarterly instead of monthly  right? If April paid $2000 on iras  then May 500 ntuc and June 1k Petrol and ntuc  is it meeting the requirement for the cashback 5% and/or 10% (5% for base and additional 5% for selected merchant)?,btohqsg
I won't risk it as I assume it doesn't work that way,btohqsg
Based on the lowest tier  not highest. Hence $500 tier,btohqsg
This video will explain the UOB One complicated requirementshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16FDXulNF9Y,btohqsg
Thanks@ChrisHMSG.. ill just use the blue color to get the 150 cashback. After that i will use the gold color for points. Linking to instarem card.,btohqsg
Can still link blue to amaze too,btohqsg
Thanks  you are right as its quite complicated and needs consistent confirmation of your spending every month to get the Quarterly Cashback so the effort does not goes to waste,btohqsg
I think i use your other recommendation of Amex True cashback of 3% through Grab mastercard with AXS,btohqsg
Sorry  I'm not familiar with this as I'm not using this method yet,btohqsg
anyone know anyway o get back credit score?,btohqsg
www.creditbureau.com.sg$6.42 per credit report requested  but you can get one for free within 30 calendar days if you applied for any credit facility (credit card / personal loan / overdraft etc.),btohqsg
no as in  those low score how to get back to high score,btohqsg
"1) Pay everything back on time at least the minimum payment2) Try not to fully tap on your full credit limit (eg. if you have a 10k credit limit with one bank  try to use max 7-8k)3) Don't request to open/sign up too many credit cards/loans/overdrafts at one time; safe amount is maybe 1-3 per month4) Note that if you have a facility that you don't usually use which the bank has charged annual fee on and you forgot to waive it  resulting in late payment  you will have a ""Late Payment Record"" in your report for at least 12 months  so remember to check in on those and close off any facilities you foresee that you won't be using in the near term",btohqsg
Not sure of ezlink  but top up nfp via gtm does clock poweup. Max top up $100 per day,btohqsg

Syfe trade after sell how later can withdrawal bal,btohqsg
i made a number of refundable bookings for my euro trip next month before thinking of maximizing rewards. should i cancel and hope that i can rebook? it’s at least 3-4k worth. like pretty wasted. bad enough that air tickets and some hotels are non-refundable.,btohqsg
The KrisPay miles converted can then be transferred to your KrisFlyer account^ (1 KrisPay mile = 1 KrisFlyer mile) or you can choose to keep them in your KrisPay wallet for future purchases.,btohqsg
have button after you tranfer to krispay to transfer to krisflyer,btohqsg
Usually 3 work days. I haven't tried,btohqsg
I would make another booking first then cancel the refundable ones. Provided the slots are still available,btohqsg
No. Other than Amex true cashback,btohqsg

Citi PremierMileshttps://bit.ly/HM-CitiPMComplimentary travel insurance if you charge travel expenses to ithttps://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/pdf/complimentary-travel-insurance.pdf,btohqsg
has anyone been blacklisted by the bank for churning through the credit card sign up gifts before? (eg. signup for citibank and collect the free ipad  cancel it after 1 year  then sign up again after another 1 year ),btohqsg
If that's the case  the bank will not even approve subsequent applications for their products,btohqsg
i just got the woman’s world card. however  transactions for food panda  grab keeps getting declined. they claim due to security and high number of fraudulent transactions.,btohqsg
it was so infuriating hearing the cso repeating its due to security and i need to request for bypass that only allows transactions for these merchants for 24 hours. and i’m not allowed any disputes. i’m so confused.,btohqsg
