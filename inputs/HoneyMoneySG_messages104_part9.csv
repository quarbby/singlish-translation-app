A query  if anyone had deposited long enough with the digital banks  since MariBank and GXS credits the interest daily  would there be a compounding effect?,btohqsg
Like for Mari  the current 2.88% would include the balance and interest of previous days,btohqsg
surely have compounding effect since its daily calculated,btohqsg
just try no matter what  i spent way below and still got it waived,btohqsg
I actually checked every 5 minutes. And as of now. No Uob interest has been credited for value date 30th April. But I suspect we will see some back dated posting.Which means no way to escape the MAB distortion if you were trying to keep it to $10 for example.,btohqsg
Confirm will based on the past. Just I never paid so much attention to when it was posted.If posted at 10pm region still can move out. But if they back date to 30th April when it never appeared on 30th April means no way to escape.,btohqsg
I did noticed for Mar they did backdate.. after their maintenance hours,btohqsg
Anyone know if i can move all cash out from ocbc 360 or i need wait until 7th working day for interest to credit in before moving,btohqsg
Cause i no more salary credit into ocbc this month so not using anymore,btohqsg
Want move 50k into uob to fulfill the 150k,btohqsg
If you’re not using anymore  doesn’t matter when you move it out. You can move before 7th since interest is based on your April mab,btohqsg

How do I register for this promo? I'm a existing user and have not participated in Moneybull promo before but can't find this promo under Moneybull tab or promotions tab,btohqsg
Last time last time new fund is calculated based on last day of the month.,btohqsg
Uob AM invest need how many days to approved .. mine still pending approval after 3 days,btohqsg
Someone reported even their office has been shuttered down. Just take it as its gone case. Don't keep your hopes too high.,btohqsg
You do know that investment means there is a possible loss of value for your money compared with putting in saving account?,btohqsg
Anyone use dollardex here? Appreciate can the experience  thanks,btohqsg
i set up hsbc giro to pay dbs credit bill last month. I got dbs cc statement today. how long does it take for hsbc to pay dbs? my hsbc has sufficient account.,btohqsg

Uob AM invest need how many days to approve.. mine still pending approval after 3 days,btohqsg
Will the staff still get salary?,btohqsg
Anybody use Trust to withdraw money in Taiwan? Is there any fee charged?,btohqsg
Otherwise the temporary suspend will become permanent suspend  probably the owner looking for buyer,btohqsg
Oh  sorry  were you the one who said their office has been shut down? If it is  there's still some hope although even their staff could be kept in the blind by their management.,btohqsg
Trust doesn't have atm withrawal fee I think. I only tried with 1 atm from Cathay United Bank (green color) and there was no bank fee charge.,btohqsg
Find a bank ATM. Not those inside 7-11 or at train station as these have charges. We withdrew at several bank ATMs with no additional charges and the rates are better than money changers,btohqsg
What do y’all use to pay at foodcourts and hawkers then? I’m using Grabpay and ShopBack  not sure is that’s the best alternative..,btohqsg

https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.pageEffective interest rate of UOB ONE revised?Seems to be 4.5% for 1st $150k instead of 4%. Or is it I see wrong?,btohqsg
Hi current I got 50k in UOB stash acc and 50k in UOB one.If I transfer 50k out from UOB stash today to other bankTomorrow transfer back 50k to UOB one acc  does it consider fresh fund and qualify UOB big savings payout?,btohqsg
4.5% only for mid tier from 75K-125K but EIR is 4%,btohqsg
Sry noob qn; how u get 4.5% EIR?,btohqsg
Not all banks will let you see the card details online. If not available  you can only wait for your physical card.,btohqsg
Huh really ah  I thought it’s compared against MAB in March.,btohqsg
What’s the next best telco plan besides ZYM $10 plan,btohqsg
Irritating. And u cannot take out the $4.24 today also,btohqsg
Oh wait must be blind. Paiseh,btohqsg
Yes but read the tnc. Money deposit or form submission  whichever is later. Your form submission is in May so only May deposit will count.,btohqsg
YupIt’s always backdated.Actually in system  I think it would only be withdrawable next morning. Coz I checked at 1am  3am  still doesn’t show interest but next morning 8am  it’s there liao and can transfer,btohqsg
based on the TnC  form submitted in May and he already have fresh fund by 31 May (in Apr)  so technically the earmark should occur in Jun. But then I think better to withdraw and redeposit in May to be extra safe.,btohqsg
https://sg.shp.ee/WkJwyxGSo I top up $200 via PayNow equivalent then get 200 Shopee Coins.

Means I earned $2 worth of coins without spending anything ah?Has anyone tried?Oh ya  can only have 1 free withdrawal per month  so pls check 1st before u try.,btohqsg
no way to get EIR 4.5% for UOB One now  but u can get more if coupled with UOB Big Savings Payout Promotion,btohqsg
