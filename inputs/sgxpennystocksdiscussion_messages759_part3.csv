"üéâPika World Daily Review ‚Äì 8 Feb 2023üéâüéôUncle Powell maintained rate hike stanceüéØHe hammered the idea smoothly that a continuous rate hike is still warranted. One promising statement was that he acknowledged the scenario of the ""disinflationary process"" had begun. This comes at a critical time after a dramatic surprise job report. So  it is the first shoot of a positive sign in his statement.The blowout job figure had indeed caused some uneasiness among investors who had initially anticipated or at least hoped for a pause in the rate hike cycle. Thus  speculation of a more hawkish Powell was roaming around the talks of the town.Nonetheless  he maintained his tone  similar to the FOMC conference. Investors heaved relief. That's the second sign of happiness for investors.üìäJob reports hint at a long fight against inflationüé≤As Uncle Powell spoke to David Rubenstein  he reflected on the idea that the robust job figure further strengthened the notion that service inflation will likely be a sticker for a more extended period. Thus  investors can best digest an elevated interest rate for a prolonged period.We further increase our odds that the federal fund rate  terminal rate  as some say  should hit above 5%. A downside risk is that goods inflation which has come down  may revive again should exogenous shock hit the supply chain again.üìÆWhat are our dishes today?There are several speeches. Let's go through them.At 10.15 pm  FOMC member William will begin speaking. This is followed by Fed Barr  who is expected to talk at 11 pm.It is 8 Feb  Wednesday  8.50 am in Singapore and 7.50 pm in New York. The market is revitalized with a strong showing after a loud swing. So let's aim for a good trading day.From your lovely newsdesk friend Pika Nat.",btohqsg
