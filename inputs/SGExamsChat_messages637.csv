"Nah i was talking to bedok jn about how someone in the disc used quora as a source to try and one up me but when i told her that quora is unreliable she said "" u dont have to rub it in like ur the queen """,btohqsg
Btw did you see the updates about the SPY,btohqsg

Everywhere my entire body hurts like shit,btohqsg
if it‚Äôs muscle soreness then a warm shower is the way to go,btohqsg
light recovery exercises that are more dynamic,btohqsg
if it‚Äôs swelling those kind then use cold compress,btohqsg

u nvr do the saf cool down thats why,btohqsg
Lol this reminded me of my bruise,btohqsg
I wanted to run 2.4 ytd but bruise was actly hurting my mobility abit eh,btohqsg

"didn't wanna risk ""worsening it"" sooo üòî",btohqsg
i mean it probs won‚Äôt worsen it but nah,btohqsg
at most walk more to get some movement and blood flow in,btohqsg
lol i had a bruise so bad that even after it faded  the pain nvr fully went away,btohqsg

Omg SI YAN ADMITTING HES AN OLD FUCK,btohqsg
bc i‚Äôm talking to the older fuck,btohqsg
you‚Äôre in the same league tho,btohqsg
My first digit is still a 1,btohqsg
This isn't exactly credible ain't it,btohqsg
trusting me is always more credible than you,btohqsg
Oh wow you say that as if you seldom make lapses in judgement,btohqsg
Not to worry you won't kenna,btohqsg
I'm allergic to Si Yan  anw,btohqsg
seeing it is more than too much,btohqsg
dawg my classmate has ss tuition?,btohqsg
The afterschool care with some chapalang tuition?,btohqsg
It means there's still a risk before 2 or 3,btohqsg
her first digit is 1 but her mindset is like it begins with an 8,btohqsg
Yes but my pt is that it's still gg to be 1 unlike someone's,btohqsg
I'm going to make u take that back irl,btohqsg
just that he has adhd ig,btohqsg
I hope you don't have to end up going to the er cause of me,btohqsg
There are many people with good English level  especially on professional settings  e.g. Si Yan,btohqsg
i meant my fren who is going to this edufirst,btohqsg
If only you guys know how many of these centres work behind the scenes üò≠,btohqsg
For Edufirst  simple. Open as afterschool care as main income revenue.So to earn more profit  just add tuition. If someone ask  go to tuition agency  ask for tutors. Go for the cheaper ones that sounds and looks ok. Tada.The parent is better off hiring 1 to 1 tutors at the same cheap rate from the tuition agency,btohqsg
ive thought of wanting to get private tutor for english n sci,btohqsg
off the top of my head,btohqsg
sci im worried if the cher wld have their own material,btohqsg
and also sec 4 alrdy too troublesome run thru sum chers,btohqsg
or 8 years old also can,btohqsg
why you always gotta resort to violence ü§ï,btohqsg
only way i can see ss tuition being useful is wacking qns until the cow comes home lmao,btohqsg
MATCHA MEI MEI I THOUGHT THE ONE WHO SEND THAT PIC WAS RAND,btohqsg
matcha and rand are on the same wavelength with these things,btohqsg
no comments. But Physics tuition I don't conduct this way,btohqsg
i‚Äôve explicitly turned on private tutoring if parents expect me to just do that lol,btohqsg
i meant for languages i much prefer just doing practices and learning wat i m doing wrong,btohqsg
for math and sciences teaching concept more impt ofc,btohqsg
pls enlighten me oh great atarax of tampines,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt have your old lady wisdom,btohqsg
For language no choice need keep practice,btohqsg
The first I'm gg to do if we ever meet is not wave,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt give extra notes if the student don‚Äôt even understand what adjectives and adverbs are,btohqsg
I'm straight up going to do a hadouken,btohqsg
would be a funny sight for the public to see tho,btohqsg
I jus realise they demolished the hdb,btohqsg
When I grad it‚Äôs still there mah,btohqsg
you doing this is more believable,btohqsg
you do know I happen to own three real swords,btohqsg
I'll use rengoku one and make u a donut just like him,btohqsg
saf supposed to teach you discipline,btohqsg

Eh it just seemed like you're the type to hold a grudge,btohqsg
im fine w lipton but not for like 2$ lol,btohqsg
u can buy like 100 pack for 7$,btohqsg
i like mac breakfast wrap tho lol,btohqsg
I love the one with hash brown,btohqsg
Noo there's two kinds of wrap dumb fuck,btohqsg
it‚Äôs breakfast wrap chicken ham or chicken sausage la fuck,btohqsg
Doesn't have to do with phd,btohqsg
she doesn‚Äôt question when it‚Äôs physics related,btohqsg
If he can't ans/differentiate  such things,btohqsg
then fr it's time to qn the phd,btohqsg
oh ya I read up on that,btohqsg
but idgi what it is actly,btohqsg
like you feel like you‚Äôre an imposter as in you‚Äôre a fraud and don‚Äôt deserve to be in your position,btohqsg
in academia it‚Äôs kinda insane bc it‚Äôs easy to get caught up with the breakthroughs others made,btohqsg
even tho we‚Äôre working on v diff things,btohqsg
dude so much shit happened on that day,btohqsg
Ngl everytime u say 26 Jan,btohqsg
"Ill go ""???"" In my mind",btohqsg
doesn‚Äôt mean shit if you suck at using them,btohqsg
I mean I can always stab u with it,btohqsg
p sure you‚Äôre gonna get arrested before you reach me,btohqsg
As compared to a kitchen knife,btohqsg
My build gonna be diff then,btohqsg
even yt can‚Äôt vouch for miracles,btohqsg
You'd expect him to lie then?,btohqsg
idts? never really held a grudge,btohqsg
it was fun when the panadol effects lasted,btohqsg
eh it speeds up recovery as much as just walking and moving does,btohqsg
FUCK I'm holding myself back rn,btohqsg
that was v v slow even for you,btohqsg
anyway i have screenshots set to auto delete in like a day lol,btohqsg
just fun to fuck with you,btohqsg
lol i always see those centres around,btohqsg
Lol I wish I was there to see kuro handling,btohqsg
I ate one tiny chilli and that shit burned my lips,btohqsg
the truth for tuition centres is those who sell well get more studentsregardless of their tutors or capabilities or lesson effectiveness,btohqsg
honestly speaking  teaching low level stuff to kids is still extremely challenging,btohqsg
it's about breaking it down to their understanding level,btohqsg
it's like  can't explain law of gravitation to a p sch kid,btohqsg
Oh u reminded me of these utube vids where they actly did that,btohqsg
SI YAN THIS WILL BE U TO ME LOL,btohqsg
It's him trying to tell me abt wtf he doing for his phd,btohqsg
He's actly more decent in exp phy shit than my phy cher,btohqsg
I was in phy lesson learning g field,btohqsg
And I didn't get any shit the Cher was saying,btohqsg
And Cher was lenient or smth and we were doing g field qnsEdit: I was sneakily using it in class,btohqsg
Literally texted si yan in the middle of it,btohqsg
He's being a real G rn,btohqsg
Me and my friend sneak to,btohqsg
Like some circuit thing how to calc,btohqsg
Once the lecturer talk abt graph,btohqsg
Damn funny caught by one of the chers and shit,btohqsg
Is it that normal to have u and another person to have the same research although yall don‚Äôt know each other,btohqsg
I feel like at that level it‚Äôs not about how good your tutor is  and it‚Äôs more about how good your tuition centre‚Äôs brand is,btohqsg
I go toilet also need wear helmet and lbs ah ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
they recall everyone including those gonna Ord in 5 days,btohqsg
worst than going into toilet mask on  shower mask off den mask on after going out of cubical,btohqsg
need to put this in a miata asap,btohqsg
which level do i have to use with you is the thing ü§î,btohqsg
only time i won‚Äôt flame you at all,btohqsg
can explain to me like im 5 years old,btohqsg
Maybe you're just born that way,btohqsg
As an empath I shall try to relate,btohqsg
she deleted the post but she was flexing abt how she fought with her bf then she went club that night and hooked up with some guy,btohqsg
i consider myself a girls girl (im a guy) but,btohqsg
jesus fuck now im a guys guy,btohqsg
was looking forward to some tea to read today is a slow day,btohqsg
People like her r the reason men go incel,btohqsg
if i were god id flood it this year,btohqsg
We fought because she kept talking to the guys that had sex with her,btohqsg
Then right afterwards  she fucked some guy from telehitch,btohqsg
I think I'm gonna stay single for the foreseeable future,btohqsg
But you'll need quantifiable proof of damages,btohqsg
Defo got damages to Ur rep and all also right,btohqsg
For example if you missed out on a scholarship worth $30 000  you can sue her for that much,btohqsg
didn't that happen to a guy recently,btohqsg
Because ruining their life is funny too,btohqsg
he lost his scholarship over it,btohqsg
the guy who falsely accused him got jailed but his scholarship still gone sad,btohqsg
Yes  and they should sue the guy who falsely accused him.,btohqsg
Always document the amount you've potentially lost within reason,btohqsg
So you can claw it back from other people some day :),btohqsg
but yea this is a thing ah,btohqsg
Do you guys know anyone else like her?,btohqsg
Who kind of goes against the guy's boundaries,btohqsg
why whenever i look into this chat i always see u talking abt ur ex,btohqsg
And keeps talking to people she had sex with,btohqsg
later kena hunt down by gang again,btohqsg
she claims to have a ‚Äúbrother‚Äù inside,btohqsg
kinda shows u what kind of person she is,btohqsg
but last i heard he got deported,btohqsg
imagine mixing with bottom of society,btohqsg
unless u like the management for gangs,btohqsg
if u just some minion den,btohqsg
i farming my resume just to try to match up to my social circle lol,btohqsg
plus now not like our parents era where gang is the last resort,btohqsg
nah i‚Äôm just asking in case you are. as an empath im trying to relate and be considerate,btohqsg
i learn from ns that whatever u do  dont be the last can liao,btohqsg
and post on lemon8 bragging abt ot,btohqsg
its the ‚Äúoh he cldnt take it so we broke up‚Äù at the end,btohqsg
someone track this bitch down and dox her,btohqsg
kan ppl ard me got business all alr,btohqsg
not sec sch for me but yes,btohqsg
useful for learning what not to do,btohqsg
me: yale (i signed up for a coursera course by them),btohqsg
i applied there for my phd,btohqsg
one of my friends oxford law,btohqsg
then another is now a postdoctoral at MIT bruh,btohqsg
i see online that QS is just a benchmark for the research done by profs for the school,btohqsg
high qs dont mean good teaching staff,btohqsg
but now it‚Äôs taking teaching more into account afaik,btohqsg
i heard the slides for ntu,btohqsg
is the same since the 90s?,btohqsg
teaching is way harder to judge compared to research tho,btohqsg
main issue is how they read off the slides without giving 0 fucks abt the student,btohqsg
and they can‚Äôt attend classes from everywhere,btohqsg
my profs weren‚Äôt like this la so no comment,btohqsg
"""u guys are uni students now  u guys should do your own reading before coming to class""",btohqsg
idk but i hear this alot,btohqsg
the complaints i hear is almost always from engineering side one,btohqsg
not wrong but just... makes the students wonder why they pay sch fees to teach themselves,btohqsg
legit u come or no come class is the same,btohqsg
downside is if the prof writes something out of the camera u cant see,btohqsg
ntu physics i‚Äôve had zero issues like that,btohqsg
no clue how they rate teaching for qs rankings,btohqsg
i can give the full story on that considering i was involved lmao,btohqsg
i also made the ntu homeless sticker pack,btohqsg
Kuro Sama did u know si yan lost to me once,btohqsg
You'd rather prefer me summoning irl you,btohqsg
Why u don't fucking believe me,btohqsg
what kind of impression was I supposed to get,btohqsg
idgi why are you not that riled up when I try to kachau u,btohqsg
As opposed to bedok and si yan,btohqsg
learn to be in the moment u fucktard or you'll end up all old and grumpy in no time,btohqsg
Ngl your rxn q funneh also,btohqsg
then me and bedok is the mc,btohqsg
The one you'd said eng dub and jap sub,btohqsg
by right hall points means rec list and you get priority in securing hall. then that year somehow all the high pointers also cmi  y2 students cmi  worst of all half the international students didn‚Äôt get a place and were asked to move out by a certain day,btohqsg
like international students always got priority then suddenly on short notice they‚Äôre asked to find some other accommodation,btohqsg
their reasoning was covid then cannot occupy any room wtv but there were so many empty ones or like they at least should allocate more to internationals la,btohqsg
i also didn‚Äôt get even tho i‚Äôm on rec list btw,btohqsg
international student no place to stay,btohqsg
then one of my friends started the ntu homeless tele channel to try and make some changes,btohqsg
so they contacted mothership at first then other news outlets,btohqsg
eventually managed to spread to straits times,btohqsg
then at first ntu office is like ok international students get more time to find new accommodation,btohqsg
eventually they finally let them stay but by then a lot of them alr found accommodation alr,btohqsg
meanwhile locals that couldn‚Äôt get all put on waitlist,btohqsg
i got offered a room more than halfway into the sem like bruh,btohqsg
and yea this too we went to screenshot every instance of the two year guaranteed thing before they can change,btohqsg
then i created the sticker pack LOL,btohqsg
No fucking way they made it into a sticker,btohqsg
Am honoured to meet the owner,btohqsg
bought too many in the past lol,btohqsg
Kuro is enjoying the show I see,btohqsg
Why r u speaking for him,btohqsg
it‚Äôs one of my favourites HAHA,btohqsg
like you said  brothers in arms,btohqsg
wld love to sell them lol,btohqsg
Welp you make it seem as tho he can barely speak for himself,btohqsg
even half off is still like 500$ reee,btohqsg
well he hasn‚Äôt said anything since then so,btohqsg
aren't u the most familiar with that word,btohqsg
we‚Äôre both very proficient at plagiarising each other,btohqsg
I thought you don't like straight up assumptions,btohqsg
bruh kuro was typing for a bit then he dipped again,btohqsg
Ig it happens to everyone at some point,btohqsg
oh my gosh I'm so affected by that statement that I'm going to become potentially insomniac for the next few days,btohqsg
you don‚Äôt need my help to be an insomniac,btohqsg
i need to use that pack with my own friends,btohqsg
Man istg the stickers are so directed to him on so many levels,btohqsg
this sounds like smth my prof wishes he could say to me at times,btohqsg
actually this is probs my profs reaction whenever he meets me,btohqsg
why U starting to act up now,btohqsg
i know a gp tutor that has >30 uniqlo mono colour t shirts,btohqsg
I thought normally is the NS ugly off colour green  shirt,btohqsg
i haven‚Äôt worn an ns shirt since ns,btohqsg
just not a fan of singlets,btohqsg
ofc cause u have nth to show,btohqsg
you literally don‚Äôt even know what i look like,btohqsg
eh i‚Äôd believe you. i‚Äôm easy enough to find,btohqsg
my insta nothing but linkedin yes,btohqsg
You already said you're easy to doxx,btohqsg
your bag sling nvr wear properly,btohqsg
ngl it‚Äôs probs in my best interest to remove the pfp lol,btohqsg
curiosity got the best of me,btohqsg
it's cause y'all doxx each other here,btohqsg
pfp was from my grad trip,btohqsg
5k per person worth for a 2+ week trip,btohqsg
I feel like girls facial features don't necessarily change that drastic overtime,btohqsg
yea i know what you mean,btohqsg
Holy shit that's such a sticker idea,btohqsg
ya sia my facial features more defined ig,btohqsg
Ngl my baby face till now,btohqsg
I'm not round but if you see my toddler pic   you'd know it's me,btohqsg
Then also how I do my hair,btohqsg
Oh mines black but uh hexagon/pentagon shape,btohqsg
Also easier to pair clothes w it,btohqsg

who is also somehow a dentist,btohqsg
my specs now is the transparent one lol,btohqsg
everyone and their mother uses that now,btohqsg
LOL my right is shit 150 225,btohqsg
‚Äúwow our eyesight is equally fucked. we‚Äôre meant to be!!‚Äù,btohqsg

Then she somehow somewhat switched to contact lens from sec sch onwards,btohqsg
Smth abt my mom like almost 1k deg,btohqsg
i used to wear half frame kind bc my fam decided for me,btohqsg
but they didn‚Äôt fit me at all,btohqsg
i linked her a piano playing vid on my ig,btohqsg
not my fault you literally put kuro on your bio,btohqsg
Si Yan does kuro  face reveal in his ig,btohqsg
nowadays it‚Äôs mainly food and other people,btohqsg
not like i‚Äôm sending it here,btohqsg
control your behaviour otherwise imma leak it to anonymous ppl,btohqsg
and help u buy followers on ig,btohqsg
fr sia i was dying when walking around today,btohqsg
atarax did win in a banter against me once,btohqsg
i thought it was more tbh but once makes more sense,btohqsg
nah one out of a million,btohqsg
but i give it to her bc she‚Äôs so proud when she does,btohqsg
you see here this mini victory she partying alr,btohqsg
DUDE CAN U JUST ADMIT YOU LOST ONCE LIKE A GRACEFUL LOSER,btohqsg
You're a fucking pain in my ass,btohqsg
i lost to you once :(,btohqsg
not with the double meaning play on words pretentious bullshit,btohqsg
we just like going at each others throats,btohqsg
Nah he lost to me once   and he has to give up his ego and proclaim to the world that he DID in fact lose to me fair and square,btohqsg
cause that red flag of his is beaming rn,btohqsg
Ig its the same as like,btohqsg
Suppose you find amath very difficult but you manage to get A for it,btohqsg
Then you move on to doing h2 maths,btohqsg
So amath seems easy in comparison,btohqsg
Yea its like ur own standards went up,btohqsg
i did in fact lose to you in a banter once fair and square,btohqsg
every a levels you see people praying there,btohqsg
all the while my maths is ok,btohqsg
i look at h2 stuff now and i‚Äôm like,btohqsg
Is it like nursery kinda level to you,btohqsg
Tiktokkers when they fail math wa because they didnt study but expected praying to kongzi would help them pass ü§Øü§Øü§Ø,btohqsg
like how would U see it at your level rn,btohqsg
Omg ya sia they pray to every god in existence,btohqsg
Then there's this what manifest shit also,btohqsg
that‚Äôs like o level physics to me,btohqsg
