Hi hi can anyone give recommendations on what to do if you can’t see your side mirror when it’s raining heavily? I can’t really see much on side mirror and mirror and I was planning to do tinting as well,btohqsg
Any shops to recommend as well?,btohqsg
Buy those film stickers off of Lazada/shopee that will prevent water from staying on,btohqsg
I think I have one on my side mirror but not really working,btohqsg
And then should I do my tinting before or after pasting haha,btohqsg
U tint side mirror de meh?,btohqsg
Just tint first cus sg hot weather,btohqsg
Better to splurge if you can!,btohqsg
Prevent those nasty UV rays from your skin,btohqsg
I first thing I do when get car is tint,btohqsg
My first car i mistake i didnt tint,btohqsg
Your window tint doesn't affect the mirror though?,btohqsg
Cause the mirror also need to put the anti rain thingy if not can’t see also,btohqsg
Then the same mirror need to do tinting also haha,btohqsg
Yes that is separate from your tints,btohqsg
Why would you tint your ORVMs,btohqsg
I mean the side window haha,btohqsg
Yes side window you won't be pasting the anti rain thing,btohqsg
Can we just call it side mirror,btohqsg
Cause sometimes also hard to look at the side mirror from the side window. And sometimes it fogs out as well,btohqsg
And also lower the window slightly,btohqsg
That means on window tint must cut one hole at the side mirror position,btohqsg
That one tint too dark already hahahha,btohqsg
Use hydrophobic coating on it so the water beads and flows away smoothly,btohqsg
But can see ah.. Got square box to see out,btohqsg
Got any car workshop can do this one haha,btohqsg
Any to recommend if you don’t want to go JB to do,btohqsg
Hahaha can’t la. I quite noob at this,btohqsg
This thing so small no need to go JB,btohqsg
"You'll spend more than you ""save""",btohqsg
Either one of those places good,btohqsg
And the rain sticker for the ORVMs,btohqsg
We all start somewhere sir. Soon you’ll go from NIL TO HERO!,btohqsg
Nil name change to “Little Bit”,btohqsg
That's a bit of a tautology,btohqsg
But what if they aren't electric,btohqsg
Eh you in Tampines again issit,btohqsg
Maybe someone else with the same exo and front as you,btohqsg
Usually ppl dont take quad tips,btohqsg
Do we still need to apply vep to enter malaysia?,btohqsg

What do you think of civics,btohqsg
What is your favorite way to pass time?,btohqsg
What do you think of tyres,btohqsg
U nvr use bbk from sti one ?My bbk from GT500 mustang 😂,btohqsg
Coe mini same as other conti with regards to reliability ?,btohqsg
Is dis a separate qn or u asking pete,btohqsg
Happen to see a new listing within my budget range,btohqsg
Oh which mini and what engine also plays a impt part,btohqsg
Buy Mini just prep 10k for maintenance honestly,btohqsg
If you're looking at the r56 generation,btohqsg
It is notorious for reliability issues,btohqsg
Most r56 ones on the market the powertrain is pre bmw takeover,btohqsg
So they're on a different type of engine that wasn't very reliable,btohqsg
Switched to bmw engines with the 2.0 being the b48 which is super reliable and a great platform as long as you maintain it right and don't slap on cheap mods,btohqsg
There's enough BMWs out there which were cheaply modded and poorly maintained and then the owners could not afford to fix issues they caused/could not keep up with wear and tear that happened quicker as they poorly modded the car,btohqsg
And they end up selling in the half arsed state,btohqsg
Ooh. That’s good to know. just curious with regards to such knowledge is it just follow car news frequently or can Google one. Cause when I try search online hard to see,btohqsg
Not bad also but harder to find clean units,btohqsg
can help teach me what does clean mean?,btohqsg
Especially if you're looking at the f10 520i or f30 320i,btohqsg
Well maintained  good health of powertrain and unmolested,btohqsg
Some owners like to add alot interior mods.. then wire never do properly,btohqsg
https://www.humblebundle.com/games/turkiye-syria-earthquake-relief-bundlenot car related but if you game you should get this.,btohqsg
And tell everyone bmw so bad and hard to maintain that’s why they are selling 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Can post or not is for admin to decide lmao. I got 72 pc games for dirt cheap and helped turkey/Syria in the process.... No need for you to be bitter over it,btohqsg
That day he was unhappy coz we were talking about music 🎶,btohqsg
he's just a bitter prick with nothing better to do,btohqsg
Maybe he can go apply at SGCM and join the admin team,btohqsg
Sure way to get into more financial difficulties.,btohqsg
jokes on you i don't even have $55 to withdraw,btohqsg
Ahhh that’s why you can withdraw $55k from Harris Isabella scammer’s platform mah,btohqsg
But first you need to inject $10 000 so that your money can magically grow and then disappear!!!!! 💨,btohqsg
real anot lol later car burn,btohqsg
no matter how cheap i wont trust,btohqsg
brakes  engine oil  spark plug  piston - no way,btohqsg
u do realise he is a troller right..,btohqsg
So peter also your account ah,btohqsg
You ask for spark plugs on them also,btohqsg
The only over and aboveboard thing is your nonsense,btohqsg
Get lost and never come back,btohqsg
those who really trade with and know China  will know that China like everywhere else factually has a range of suppliers with different quality standards .. too many often habitually use a broad brush to paint products from China to be inferior .. which isn't the case today .. hence for those who get carbon fiber hoods from China  preferably to know people on the ground who knows which are the ones that have quality and are reliable ..,btohqsg
SG workshops boh pian  even with 90% or even 100% of their mechanics from Msia  they still have cost to contend with  notwithstanding some do obviously attempt to abuse with their charges for basic services ..,btohqsg
Wa what car you drive 80L full tank? G wagon ah,btohqsg

Cost savings R&DIf spent too muchCost of car increaseOther people will just buy VW.Toyota biggest competitors is VW.Both of them are always top 1/2 biggest car manufacturer,btohqsg
The jap car makers rlly need to design better looking cars,btohqsg
toyota is not exactly cheap if you compare their prices with honda,btohqsg
Toyota is exp sia bro now,btohqsg
They focus more on premium modelToyota CamryLexusHonda AccordHonda CRVHonda OdysseyCannot see Singapore Toyota price.Must see Japan price.Honda Fit is just an budget hatchback(many different spec)Honda N-Box has better features.(Best selling K-Car/Family car in Japan),btohqsg
I like the looks of the N Van  quirky,btohqsg

hi just wanna check  was told that pumping petrol in Sg (always pump ESSO regular  full tank after dis is $75) is somewhat btr than pumping in jb. is it true? some say pump petrol in sg can go more miles than pumping JB's petrol,btohqsg
like that amt saved is not worth the trip there (i stay amk fyi) n the jam nowadays,btohqsg
when u pump full 75 after disc,btohqsg
please let me know which credit card u use,btohqsg
how many litre worr ur car?,btohqsg
if u wanna save  u cannot just go up there pump. u need do other stuff   eg groceries eating and stuff,btohqsg
u need factor in VEP also  toll fee and all these,btohqsg
but in SG i assuming ur pumping 95,btohqsg
u go up there is pump 97,btohqsg
if ur full tank is 50 litres,btohqsg
aft conversion with VEP and toll fees included,btohqsg
ur full tank cost if u go north is about 57 - 60 sgd,btohqsg
You forget the fuel wasted to drive into msia,btohqsg
Compared to driving to your fuel station down the road,btohqsg
we ignore those factors cus we are looking solely at cost,btohqsg
i think its only more worth while if you have errands to run,btohqsg
Also not included  risk of one facing the fuel check and being sent back,btohqsg
dont forget 1st time fine only. 2nd 3rd time is court liao,btohqsg
But for an accurate comparison here  can't ceteris paribus because time is indeed money,btohqsg
I'm hoping the person stops after the first time,btohqsg
So strange Ah. This question then Pete come for his “perfect” subject.,btohqsg
is he talking to himself again,btohqsg
Expert in being poor and wannabe 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg

Bruh…you living on a different level,btohqsg
Maybe their wife / gf want to eat ?,btohqsg
Think when a person rent a car  they have no intention to head into accident thus the expense outlay is low. But when accident happen  the cost increased exponentially. In the end  it is all about the drivers.,btohqsg
Ya but sometimes that is not a choice,btohqsg
This pete like abit more atas@arnavguliani,btohqsg

Good business until we wanna rent but everything always booked,btohqsg
"Yeah I agree. But it funny  the car in front is ""slightly"" damage but the BlueSG in front like totally collapse in... Thought he should pay more for th edamages.",btohqsg
