Lalamove has too many foreigner doing  this app has no face verification,btohqsg

3.5 exchange rate they happily take,btohqsg

my pukimak rental company dont give my deposit back still must hang on for months if not left ready now stuck this kind of bullshit,btohqsg
Hopefully tomorrow will be a better day for you Bro.,btohqsg
I think the bigger problem is LLM not doing enough checks on drivers on the platform.,btohqsg
hybrid sky active is it same ?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a bad idea to rent to do llm. Rent to do grab still make some sense,btohqsg
highly recommended to foreigners thinking will be good idea then became amak stuck like me,btohqsg
now me working this shit platform like no home in sg  my home is in the dream land somewhere other country,btohqsg
Llm full time can‚Äôt cover rental ?,btohqsg
With this type of price how to earn?,btohqsg
Whoever told you this must be on the road 14-16hrs a day.,btohqsg
No la  this one follow LLM 24/7,btohqsg
How to survive in SG like that? With inflation and taxes?,btohqsg
My gosh‚Ä¶..another one‚Ä¶.thick skin man!! Tsk‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
North Bridge Center the carpark all red lots,btohqsg
Bike no reason do llm. Roo and grab bike earns at least 230 per day. If 9hrs around 220for grab  after add incentives,btohqsg
For grab start in town .,btohqsg
For roo  u can choose n reject,btohqsg
Ang mohs and many locals (using company registered roo acc) order roo. More atas to them,btohqsg
Go there shit and spit at his face.,btohqsg
I feel can take. As midnight no LLM jobs. Like this can earn.Just prepare few k $ fine and court case when kana stopped at roadblockThen do the math. $20 need to do how many times to cover. Worth it?For using an unlicensed public service vehicle  driving a public service vehicle without a valid vocational licence  and using a vehicle without insurance coverage  Nasrulhaq was fined S$1 800 and received a 12-month¬†driving ban.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs a weird way to see it man,btohqsg
I've been considering other platforms  currently pausing my applications for FoodPanda and grab express because they force me to pay for the box and Ts,btohqsg
If I just want to work whenever I like  but most days work 9 to 6  macam semi retirement  which platform best?,btohqsg
Although it's relatively costly to pay for it. The money could be earned back in a relatively short period. Don't lose out on opportunities over these smaller sums.,btohqsg
go up go down parking bring trolley carry in the room climbs stairs fines parking charges what u mean bro,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply. It's not about the initial cost alone  but what's the point of being so divested if just one is good enough?,btohqsg
To each their own. There's no right or wrong. Imo  I'll just see it as pay to open account.,btohqsg
There will be times where that one platform you are at just isn't giving you enough. But then again  if you are comfortable with that  since you mentioned semi retiring  then you do you. We are just giving you our opinions.,btohqsg
Take note..dont waste time taking this order. Another loan shark case,btohqsg
semi retirement must climbs stairs carry things up that call poor thing semi retirement,btohqsg
I take it as exercise la. When I have an office job  so little time and chance and motivation to exercise,btohqsg
That's one day to see it  which makes it kind of an expensive account to hold unused. Hahaha,btohqsg
Lalamove customer service called me ask why I givr customer one star,btohqsg
I tell them the customer asked me to wait 10-15 mins,btohqsg
Then the cs tell me You know you are paid to wait right???10mins for $2 !!!!!!,btohqsg
Anyone knows or kena this joke before?,btohqsg
1st 10mins is free  if you wait 15mins cannot claim,btohqsg
Sometimes one platform no orders. So we multiplatform . More orders.,btohqsg
Lalamove much heavier items. Panda grab easy easy job. Grab more orders.. later spoil your spine do too much llm . Imajine carry 19kg box up stairs and downstairs . Dangerous for your age,btohqsg
U can tell llm ur 15min worth more than $2. Tell llm to increase to at least 4$,btohqsg
If I cannot even carry 20kg any more  I'll probably quit delivery... Moving the bike needs that kind of strength occasionally. But the heaviest delivery I've carried was about 10kg. So  permission to carry on SIR! üòâ,btohqsg
Seriously  thanks for your concern and advice. Really helpful guys here,btohqsg

"Not sure anyone noticed  but recently I've not seen any jobs with the breakdown in delivery fee  and it's quite far below calculated fare  like 20km distance only $13 + $1 schedule fee. If LLM persists in putting riders at a disadvantage  and constantly no response to feedback  really feel like they need to be taught to pay heed to their ""partners"".",btohqsg
In fact  is there even a channel for giving feedback?,btohqsg
very long liao. Discount to the customer by llm  but the discount is paid by the driver,btohqsg

Labour Day a lot of lalamove agents around  normal la,btohqsg
Or should I say  public holidays,btohqsg
Kind of waste of time doing lalamove,btohqsg
"The ""future you"" will appreciate your hard work today.With this kind of rate  the future me will scold me for being so stupid to take such a lowly paid gig",btohqsg
Maybe i should build my own platform,btohqsg
As in van is enough. But I just want to know if the helper will go inside house to bring to van,btohqsg
Then it‚Äôs only fair to pay the driver extra for the extra work.,btohqsg
So if 2 helper  means 3 or 2 ppl helping,btohqsg
NB‚Ä¶..big and you ordered for a car??? Retards,btohqsg
Yes.. so my question is . If I take 2 ppl. Will this 2 ppl help me to carry the containers from my rental room to other rental house??,btohqsg
You can choose how many helpers you need and indicate it on your order. Usually  they will assist accordingly.,btohqsg
SMLJ. Who teach this mofo MPV got helper?,btohqsg
nowdays like that. yst pick up van   customer 2 pax want follow me. i say cannot need go collect other place not enough space,btohqsg
if you guys care about LLM and your future,btohqsg
Just push the media to push lalamove to come out with face verification,btohqsg
All the fare and job will instantly back to normal,btohqsg
All the foreigner and work permit holder will not able to work anymore.Case close ,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt pickup up this cheapo they take for granted. Also we don‚Äôt have insurance cover for them as passenger. Stupid Myanmar,btohqsg
All these CheapO can take grab don‚Äôt want!,btohqsg
Llm labour fee + petrol + risk fee ( from tanglin mall to paya lebar square) $12after commission. Car. After petrol n parking  earn how much ? $5 . For 40minutes job,btohqsg

Even if petrol free i dont want do wor. Total time at peak hr 40mins   parking fee. Make 8$. Who will do? Buy a plate of rice,btohqsg
That is what llm think of every llm drivers . Bangla,btohqsg

35 min for $3. This is what llm think we are worth.Oops havent count car maintanence or rental fee,btohqsg
5 more mths 35min for net zero dollars earnings.Lalamove is for lowly lowly maths ppl do only,btohqsg
Llm job is to degrade sporeans?,btohqsg
Why you muted Omg?!He simply voiced out..no vulgarities no racist comments‚Ä¶don‚Äôt mute me too‚Ä¶Lol,btohqsg
U did before his order and the customer put u as one of the favourite driverFavourite driver gets the call first,btohqsg
Is it? ü§î I thought only if he takes then he would get it? Otherwise those nearby drivers would still be able to see first. üòÖ,btohqsg
How about that green lightning that shoot upwards (or green umbrella with crooked handle)  beside the price  what does that mean?,btohqsg
U click the info icon on the left can see the high demand surge breakdown,btohqsg
Customer app can checkbox favourite driver firstOtherwise yes ur right all nearest can get too but heart icon will display and special notification sound if u are the favourite driver,btohqsg
Customer app can also block u from taking all future orders. And the only way to unblock is to livechat or email support team initiated by customer.Once they block u most likely u wont receive their order ever againIf u blocked by oddle or the big merchants then ur lalamove app maybe very little orders,btohqsg
I think maybe not consistent. I just checked (now raining heavily  very high demand)  some got lightning but no surcharge in the breakdown; some got surcharge but no lightning (more common when not raining).I thought the lightning means customer need urgent delivery,btohqsg
Yes sometimes they put the lightning to trick uScheduled fee additional $1 or $2 also considered lighting sometimes or additional distance 1 kmAlways press the info info and check the high demand surcharge,btohqsg
Or u can take this kind with additional. Customer urgent so add tips (priority fee),btohqsg
Whoever out there now earning big bucks,btohqsg
This kind I know... Best becos no commission,btohqsg
Yea now less bikes due to heavy rain and weekend,btohqsg
Hahaha. I dam tempted sia. Just saw one $10 to deliver 800m,btohqsg
Just bring umbrella  done in 10mins,btohqsg
This is where drivers get reckless and take bike orders.,btohqsg
Huh  you mean car drivers can see courier orders meh?,btohqsg
But not the other way round?,btohqsg
Of course not. You can take car load? ü´°,btohqsg
I get it. So it's intentional  that car can opt to take courier jobs. No wonder some customers try their luck  dump bulky items at lower courier fees  hope for desperate car drivers to pick up,btohqsg
Exactly. We end up on the receiving end of customers abusing our services.,btohqsg
It depends actuallyIf genuine orderCBD prefers bike.If u drive car theres no way to park at say shenton or sgx building,btohqsg
Anyone keen on oukitel rugged phone ? Use for few days only pm me,btohqsg
Hi I'm new. Asking all regulars here   Can I ask if cash out today to posb  when money will be in?,btohqsg
perhour i think spell wrongly should be perday or 24hrs,btohqsg
or maybe 125$ rupees per hour,btohqsg
This one for lorry  but they said lorry no order one,btohqsg
"You can ""cash out"" any time you want  but you will only actually get the money in your bank account the following Wednesday for cash outs done before 11.30pm on Sunday. Any cash out done after that will be bumped to the following week.You will see each cash out as a separate transaction in your bank account  I think.",btohqsg
Cfm its wednesday? Any chance Tuesday?,btohqsg
Sometimes Tuesday if Wednesday is PH. If not it is always Wednesday. Won‚Äôt be a day early and won‚Äôt be a day late,btohqsg
Hi all   usually around what time will money be in on wednesday for POSB/OCBC,btohqsg
Anyone has experience delivering to/from Sentosa? I've been avoiding it so far because of the perceived troubles  presumably worse than any condo,btohqsg
Show lalamove delivery address to get free entry. After that is empty car go out unless u wanna stay inside to enjoy the attractions due to free entry,btohqsg
Ya go out always empty car. Worse is deliver to those cove drive or ocean drive. Waste gas to drive out from there to Vivo.,btohqsg
Sentosa Cove is 3km from the Sentosa causeway. Not near  but not too far either  considering also that it's not so congested and full of traffic lights on the island  and there's usually some order originating from around there. Might give it a try... Someday üòÖ,btohqsg
It's not traffic lights. It's the speed cameras  speed bumps  humps,btohqsg
Number of others from sentosa is very very little also,btohqsg
The speed cam damn irritating i think 40kph only,btohqsg
Upper Paya Lebar to Bukit Batok for Car at $11.00 how?,btohqsg
This one no comm  so $11 is nett,btohqsg
How did he even manage to get Delivery cost to just $1??? Some hack?,btohqsg
Lalamove rates now like grabhitch rates honestly... Thankfully some orders is slightly better than grabhitch...,btohqsg
It‚Äôs so low even if it‚Äôs $11 nett. $11 take taxi from Paya Lebar to Bukit Batok also not enough.,btohqsg

Yes  make police report and just to make clear for everyone. All purchasing item customer have to transfer the money to you 1st in order for you to proceed with the job. If not  please live chat with LLM to cancel.,btohqsg
Follow protocol and wont be dissapointed.After accepting order  must call sender or receiver to confirm on what item supposed to be collected and how big. If it exceed ask them to cancel & rebook for the right mode of vehicle.if happen they mention just small item and u arrived and it wasnt small.

Llm platform so cheap. Most i guess homeless & beggars. It started early last year till now. The fare getting lower and so many took it. Illegal foreigner doing... singaporean can now slowly die.. MOM/LTA already been notified. Best of luck for those who really think its worth bending the rule.,btohqsg
Is not begger and homeless doing it,btohqsg
Is all those work permit and foreigner using other people account doing it,btohqsg

How to ask platform get back,btohqsg
U can't get back from llm 1. Cos they already got put out in their drivers guide about cash job scams. And what to do when you take cash jobs purchase service. So if u never follow instructions about getting payment first b4 purchasing  about if the purchase is above certain amount then told not to do  then too bad lor,btohqsg
How you get back $30 ah bro,btohqsg
We do parcel delivery hard earn money  they still scam us like that very bad,btohqsg

Go thru the T&C b4 u start. So u wont be spoiling the market for others. üôè,btohqsg
What does it to do with u bro,btohqsg
Spoil market means. If u never go thru the T&C doesnt read & go thru. Eg. Motorbike account  maximum dimension is 40x 30x 30cm. But item is oversized u never read u took it.. spoil market lah.. customer should book for other mode of delivery such as car and bigger.,btohqsg
"Got alot to do with all of us llm partners. We supoort each other not by being selfish only think for ourself..that's why there is a system.So next time wont be hearing from customer ""i book last week the motorbike guy took no problem""... bla bla bla... wanna save cost and the llm partners also motorbike account got took baby matteress tied on motorbike... u think?? So read 1st.",btohqsg

Not sure  but that‚Äôll put them off for sure.,btohqsg
And if they agree? Then what?,btohqsg
I saw 2 orders like these this morning  one with 1 drop more than the other  but first 2 addresses the same. So what happened is that the customer  instead of amending her order  she created a new one with the additional drop. But my customer remembered to delete the old one.Not sure if that's the case for your customer  of cos  so you may be right  for some reason,btohqsg
all they want faster faster delivery price like begger they even did not notice,btohqsg
It‚Äôs total disregard for riders safety! What a CheapO!,btohqsg

Stay vigilant guys   we delivery drivers already having hard time and have to deal with this type of idiots,btohqsg
Actually just follow what is stated by llm. Ask the customer to pay u 1st for the purchase b4 buying. If they say no then cancel. Simple as that,btohqsg

Hi guys wanna ask if a person dont pay the delivery fee how ya? Like already delivered and all then mia  will lalamove bare the amount?,btohqsg

LLM cs useless at this time  if the read you msg still don't pay you can proceed to report already,btohqsg
wtf like that also can T_T,btohqsg
Just thicken your skin go and ask for waiver... It's not even a request  it's your right. Approach MP if they won't budge  quote MND. Your MP should have heard that answer if he wasn't absent... Otherwise should have read the minutes,btohqsg
Anyone got take this order from this person before?,btohqsg

Anyone have any experience going into sentosa for deliveries using motorcycle? Is it true you‚Äôre not allowed to enter?,btohqsg
I was rejected once by the guard and had to call the customer from the hotel to walk out and collect the food. My mistake was to leave the food at the guest services hut near the sentosa gantry. Got a call from the customer saying the food went missing! My brain cannot function already cause it was almost midnight already. In my mind  if i heck care  sure lalamove penalise me because i didnt personally handover the food. So just to let the matter rest  i refunded the customer the whole food bill. I know it was stupid but at that time lalamove CS was not available and customer like never give chance. If yall were in my shoes  how would yall handle the issue better?,btohqsg
For all residential side can motorcyclist are allowed to enter and deliver. For hotels  only those hotels in RWS are allowed. The only hotel that we're allowed to deliver which is not part of RWS is W hotel. Other than that  for capella hotel  outpost and all that motorcyclist not allowed.,btohqsg
for locals motorbike riders llm  llm is not good platform to work full time  with already with high infected with foreigners permit and i was thinking it was about time i really goin to give up this platform soon since i dont want get more infected by this virus there is no more hope of a better price.,btohqsg
soons my turn i became a llm cs oneday after my turn will back to abuse driver/rider overquantity overweight oversize with the lowest cheapskate booking paid.,btohqsg

The concourse office tower is the worse place to deliver to. 1 small paper bag only but need to take the fire lift. Whole building 41 levels only 1 lift and so many people using it. Go up and down total wasted 20minszzz,btohqsg
There r other ofc buildings where delivery have to take the service lift and only 1 lift also. Want do delivery have to expect/accept this,btohqsg
Double bookings just let them  rot.,btohqsg

So they dont get anything from this except to prank you,btohqsg
They get the credits that you bought if you send it to them/followtheir instructions. Then the other things you‚Äôve bought  you gonna eat it yourself.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs on the news too  recently,btohqsg
Hi  anyone having with the immediate order location filter locked even tho you already submitted photo?,btohqsg
If you ask them to paynow you the money first  they will just disappear or cancel the order,btohqsg

nextime accept order see the floor high ready comeout  and better cancel bro if high level,btohqsg
Anyone been doing Lalamove with one their rental partners TribeCar/GetGo etc?,btohqsg
If you want to rent  I suggest don‚Äôt use GetGo. Really not worth it  unless you truly know the roads inside out. If you truly wanna rent to try and do LLM  can try using Shariot. I dunno about TribeCar  coz I have never used TribeCar before. üòÖ,btohqsg
Thanks for the insight dude  I wouldn't have to ask if the LLM pages actually stated the discounts and the individual prices,btohqsg
How much do you pay for Shariot?,btohqsg
Shariot is hourly based with peak & off peak charges. But distance and petrol charges are born by you. So you have the liberty of choosing what petrol you want to pump and what route you wanna take for your deliveries. Otherwise  my suggestion is rent outside where the rates are better. üòÖ,btohqsg
Thanks mate  anyone else got more info on rental please share üôè,btohqsg
Just happy to share my inputs. Just a little heads up  now I see more PRs on the road. Just a couple of days ago  I picked up an order at Robertson Quay  and I spotted an Ang Moh on the app.,btohqsg

Any driver tried grabexpress? Is it better than lalamove?,btohqsg
I've been thinking how to out these fellows  make LLM ban them. Thought to accept these orders when I'm resting at home already  then highlight to LLM that the account is trying to scam us  so they will ban them. Theoretically  eventually will have no more right? What do you think?,btohqsg
You can prank one.. but you cant prank an army,btohqsg
There can't be that many of them doing this right? Every ban is an account/effort wasted for them permanently. They have to create another account  maybe use a new phone number?,btohqsg
I'm just worried they bite back  get me banned. üò≠,btohqsg
I do this sometimes actually. One time I even swiped completed then they cursed me through chat. Then I got refund on commission through support.But most of the times I just accept then don't do anything.,btohqsg
Mostly big scammer organisations. Infinite number 1 lah  that's y llm also won't bother do anything üòÇ,btohqsg
I agree there can be a lot of them. But I'm sure there are a lot more of us... At least 100 good people to 1 scammer? The way I see these scammers: they're like flies  cockroaches  parasites. If you don't deal with them  it's basically just an encouragement to them.LLM has limited resources  and their real job is to deal with legit rider/driver/customer/platform issues. Can't blame them for not having time to shoo away pests  until they create a problem  eg make the news.,btohqsg
some time the llm driver also a scammer also i guess pukimak fellow no money ready purposely book at his area place to let other llm driver get busy from his place so he can get another order his mother cb poor thing,btohqsg
I just managed to get one of them banned. Score one for the good guys. üòä,btohqsg
All within 10 minutes. Just accept the order  then contact LLM CS to say customer not responsive. Don't even need to say much else,btohqsg
I dun understand how that works for him. But that also didn't make him a scammer... At most an evil person  or a prankster. Scammers are professionals and are beyond evil,btohqsg
most of the scammers they dont give details or reponding answering calls be carefull and vigilant guys,btohqsg

anyone joined LLM‚Äôs daily fixed orders before? is it really like what they claim  min earnings and zero commission?,btohqsg
Guys anyone ever kena this??I have submitted the feedback  I put because there is another order and it is heavily rain,btohqsg
Then they will say u shouldn't have taken the job if u have another order,btohqsg
They will say anything to blame the driver.,btohqsg
So what will happen next  they will deduct our wallet or suspend ACC?,btohqsg
I got this at least 3 times. Only the first time partially my fault  so they deducted about $7  half of what the food cost that spilled. The part that was my fault was that I accepted an order that was too big to fit in my bike... His fault was that he never pack the liquid stuff properly for motorcycle transport.So I thought the settlement was pretty fair. Except the guy gave me such a bad rating that my driver rating got demoted to Fair  it took me 3 months to build it back to Good.The other two  I got good reasons for being late... One was Buka Puasa time pick up at Jln Sultan  super confusing place  and I got a minor accident and had bruises to show for it. Told them I had to clean up the blood before proceeding. I even told them I stacked order (they can see it anyway) before the accident  because both going same direction. Proof with picture of fresh bruises and bandages.The last case was the pick up delayed  and I duly kept in touch with recipient to update on lateness. Proof with SMS messages  but couldn't claim waiting fees because I didn't call customer before proceeding.,btohqsg
Bottom line is...1. Follow their rules (the CS will always nag at you about these  but the rules are actually sensible  even if inconvenient). Be ready with text and picture proof2. Serve your customers well3. Tell a good story for the feedback formHope my sharing helps,btohqsg
A lot of locals aren‚Äôt street smart,btohqsg

I've been taking such orders regularly  just so that I can alert CS to ban the account.I've managed to irritate the guy so much that he can recognize me  and immediately scolds me vulgarity then cancel the order  and never place another order again because he knows I'm looking out for his order. But not before I get through to CS to ban him.,btohqsg
Can receive call from sender   unable to callback to sender and sender will ask u take photo of unit   receiver phone can‚Äôt call are all red flags for the above case right,btohqsg

Hi all Lalmove riders  driver and walkers As we navigate our daily deliveries  I‚Äôve noticed a concerning trend: our earnings are dwindling while Lalamove‚Äôs commission remains high. It‚Äôs time for us to stand together and advocate for fair compensation.Remember when we used to receive a ‚Äúschedule fee of S$2‚Äù last year? Unfortunately  that benefit has disappeared. We deserve better. Let‚Äôs unite and take a stand against low-paying jobs. Here‚Äôs my proposal:Prioritize Fair Pay: Instead of accepting $10-12 per orders  let‚Äôs hold out until customers pay priority fees of $15-18 per order then only we accept the jobs. This ensures fairness for us while benefiting Lalamove. If anyone take below 12$ job lalamove sure even lower down our pay in the future because they know we can take any job order that is below 12$.Feedback Matters: When we encounter app bugs or face challenges  our feedback often falls on deaf ears. Let‚Äôs demand responsiveness and action from Lalamove.Agent Availability: Last time  I arrived at a customer‚Äôs location  but they didn‚Äôt pick up the call. To my surprise  no agents were online to assist. We deserve better support.Together  let‚Äôs raise our voices and ensure that our hard work is duly rewarded.,btohqsg
Agreed brother. I have been practicing the rejecting of anything lower than $15 thing.,btohqsg
But the voicing out part‚Ä¶.ive given up man. No point. They really do nothing about it.,btohqsg
Imagine if y'll still willing to take jobs that is lower than 15$ then Lalamove will still thinking that they have enough rider to take jobs that is lower than 15$ and then they lower down your pay again to increase more their benefit or comission.,btohqsg
Please reject all the jobs that is lower than 15$ at least,btohqsg
let them know without riders lalamove cannot survive,btohqsg
pay is getting lesser compare last time,btohqsg
Dear Eastside riders !PT letters delivery job. anyone interested?Pls PM me. Thank you.,btohqsg
