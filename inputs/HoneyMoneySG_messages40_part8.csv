Direct payment to insurance provider using UOB One CC or through any provider service? How to do this one?,btohqsg
Oh ok they still need to pay for internet. Lol,btohqsg
just pay thru credit card? see if can go to ur insurance provider website change payment to credit card? mine is prudential so able to do so.,btohqsg
no  depends on when your salary come in.,btohqsg
a bit dangerous as different month has different number of days,btohqsg
and sometimes your company might not always credit on the same day I think,btohqsg
it's safer to use Excel and compute the average daily balance and compare with the previous month. using Excel you can do projection and determine the exact amount to take out or put in.,btohqsg
to achieve $501 average balance increase to cater for any rounding differences,btohqsg

anyone know how to take non-transferable cash out from wallet? For grab.,btohqsg
I tried to use GrabPay for GE insurance but failed,btohqsg
But my money is inside ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Tell them u wanna refund back to your card.,btohqsg
Have you tried? dp from a few people  it‚Äôs possible,btohqsg
So can I deposit $1 and get 5 spins again?,btohqsg
Fraser Mall voucher can combine usage ?,btohqsg
What do you mean by combine usage?,btohqsg
Use $5 x 4‚Ä¶ for one payment,btohqsg
I have a similar predicament when I top up grab pay e-wallet after the deduction of town council fees (there is no fixed day to deduct). If top up is via PayNow  I can withdraw the cash from e-wallet. I guess the rationale is to not to create a backdoor for customers to withdraw from credit card without paying cash advance fees.,btohqsg
Any reviews on Prudential standard chartered credit card?,btohqsg
I didn't. Cau it is from my credit card and not debit card.,btohqsg
Hope u r successful in asking for refund.,btohqsg
Me also. I just chat with Grab. They didn‚Äôt say cannot but will submit my request for refund.,btohqsg
Appreciate if u can share the outcome with the community here.,btohqsg
hello  does anyone have a list of transactions that qualifies for one account bonus interest but not for UOB one credit card quarterly cashback ($500  $1000  $2000 spending) ?,btohqsg
they look at the ADB (average daily balance) too. So if your outgoing transactions is more than what is being credited and at last day of the month you credit $500  you still will miss out on the interest for the month.,btohqsg
I managed to get my refund back in Feb. I topped up with Amex TCB. Refund will take a couple of days to reflect in the banking app though.,btohqsg
Any recommendations to utilise SCB Smart CC  HSBC Advance CC to pay IRAS lumpsum? Thanks for any feedback,btohqsg
Worth refund? Why not passing over to someone to use it since no longer have 1.5%.,btohqsg
I tried to deposit  I didn‚Äôt get the spins.,btohqsg
I need the cash to pay for my insurance leh. If i just leave it in my grab account means I will need to fork out the same amount in cash to pay for my insurance which was abt $1k.i.e i will overspend by $1k in Feb when grabpay is not my main spending mode,btohqsg
But then again this is how i analyse my spending. If you think you are ok with just leaving the money in its justified also,btohqsg
what is the wording in the app there. As I have same situation. But I not getting the refund after a weeks.,btohqsg
Agree that shdnt leave it idle considering the high interest rate. Still got other uses other than insurance which I'm sure there will be ppl willing to take over your balance,btohqsg
Just like that lor. If grab say they have refunded you maybe good to check with both sides whats the hold up,btohqsg
What you mean by people taking over lol? Its my grab account I‚Äôm the only person using it.,btohqsg
Anyway the topic got offtrack‚Ä¶the only point i want to bring across is that the grab refund process wasnt as complicated as I thought.So for those of you who top up via amex after the nerfed period and want to get refund can go ahead to ask from grab,btohqsg
Whether you see is troublesome or worth it to ask for it up to you la no judgement from me haha,btohqsg
Not literally transfer which u can't. I meant other uses like f&b (can't use cc) with families friends or services. Many other establishments cutting cc. The paynow via grab can be useful. But my bad for replying to u when I share my opinion. Not targeting u where u only sharing the refund tips,btohqsg
I think he mean use for family members.,btohqsg
Oh yeah the paynow part i use also its a good tip and good sharing. For those who are ok keep that much inside can use in this manner alsoüëçüèº,btohqsg
https://www.whatcard.sg/?amount=5.0&q=m1Not sure company MCC code?Do check this website before spending it with your credit card .,btohqsg
So does that mean I have to find some other sources to deposit $500. when to deposit?,btohqsg
Oops i should say incoming transactions to be more accurate. Eg salary credit  people transfer to you money via paynow or bank transfer etc. Even government and insurance payout also counted,btohqsg
Thanks! Then too troublesone. Will stick to the advance card and open ega. More than 1 month and hsbc still havent got back to me on the opening of ega,btohqsg
How much did you top up? Possible to pay other bills with it? Eg singtel  electric etc. Or just spend at hawker stalls or other food outlets.,btohqsg
You need to use the grabpay card for things like online payment to telco etc,btohqsg
Hi everyone can I ask for CPF contribution limits of the 102k when does it refresh? Is it follow calendar year or when you start at company?,btohqsg
for HSBC EGA 5 qualifying card transactions  bus/mrt transactions counted?,btohqsg
Has anyone tried to setup Giro/eGiro with other billing organisation that links to EGA before getting the debit card? I applied for EGA onlineJust called HSBC and the agent told me need to wait for the debit card to activate it then can link. But he sounds unsure which makes me unsure also lol.,btohqsg
