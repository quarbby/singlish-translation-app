So if dbs wwc has 1k limit for 4mpd  we split a 3k bill into 3 payments  we get 4mpd per month?,btohqsg
6% doesn't apply to you full balance. Only a portion of it. That's how the bank got you.,btohqsg
So if i have 150k  will get 4%?,btohqsg
Yes but their limit is 1.5k btw,btohqsg
No. It got reduced from 2k to 1.5k ard a year ago.,btohqsg
Ahh my friend must have gotten it wrong. Told me was 1k. Wow this atome trick is handy. Thank you so muchüôè,btohqsg
Your monthly average is $129k instead of $150k. You won‚Äôt get the full 4%z probably only 3.5% around.,btohqsg
