COE day post-motorshow up or down?!,btohqsg
Likely today will sweep most of those who bought at high coe prices 🤭🤭,btohqsg
they better sapu now  so that we have chance later for lower coe price,btohqsg
poor people can wait  rich people we give priority,btohqsg
u are naive to think that few extra piece of coe will cause price drop,btohqsg
Papy always offer hope  we always believe,btohqsg
What do these hybrid and electric car indicator lights mean?So  you want to be part of the Green Plan 2030? Familiarise yourself with these dashboard indicator lights before jumping on the EV or hybrid car bandwagon.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Curious on some of the car indicator?,btohqsg
Cat A up  Cat B down,btohqsg
I think most would have done it way before CNY to show off their new car. This week would be for those who can show after CNY holiday week.,btohqsg

Are there really a number of people who don't mind paying ~ 20k or more extra just so they can get a car in hand in time for CNY. That seems so illogical to me.,btohqsg
Well  if the buyer has money to splurge  why not? They just want to show off their status with a new car.,btohqsg
Btw Cny how to show off car if ur relative stay in hdb? U park in mscp they can’t c ur car,btohqsg
Don't ask me. Only know of ppl who will ask them to go down to see their new car or take out for a ride.,btohqsg
Still got 10 mins.Looks like gonna maintain approx same,btohqsg
Wow looks like it will float around last bidding price. What AC says or not says would impact the same for COE haha,btohqsg
dealers also need to go ATM to place bid?,btohqsg
We need singpass login bidding to be  implemented.,btohqsg
Dealers and PIs have a margin to play with,btohqsg
Take it or leave it price,btohqsg
If it goes above 116k will dealer top up for you?,btohqsg
Motorcycle is still $1. Got chance there 😘,btohqsg
see if they will revise bid,btohqsg
in the bid status page it wrtoe 116.9,btohqsg
If U sign 100k guaranteed 1 bid and Coe open 116k  dealer will top 16k,btohqsg
I think you got it. Congrats,btohqsg

hi guys  if i sign at 89k but I top up 3k  and if coe cat a becomes 95k  do I have to top up the additional or do the dealer have to top it up? thanks 👍,btohqsg
Dealer likely will just use your top up. They absorb for you = they forgo their margin.What’s the deal,btohqsg
If they say top up for guaranteed  I’d CoE 95k means whatever they need to make the shortfall they willl absorb,btohqsg
But if they say top up no guaranteed means they will only take your top up and try. That’s it,btohqsg
Eh no  likely is ah long,btohqsg
Give away free laptop = scammer?,btohqsg
Why always got this spam or scam,btohqsg
Coz they need to scam ppl to hit their KPI.. 😂,btohqsg
These scammers always post at midnight..,btohqsg
