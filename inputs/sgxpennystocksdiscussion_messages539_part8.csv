This need a lot of encouragement n support..That time all the kid come look for me.. a lot of issues.. but after they listen to me. At least never go hair wire.,btohqsg
Wow God bless you. The worst are parents shield their kids from being corrected when their kids do wrong. Teachers get frustrated n parents you failed in your parenting. Then there are parents who don’t allow their kids to experience knocks in life how their kids learn to overcome failure n stand up again to press forward in life,btohqsg
I did a lot.. after I move .. then let go everything..,btohqsg
See those kids got poor results go jump down. What is the big deal to fail an exam compared to life,btohqsg
Some kid the parents fight at home.. they come look for me.. poor things..,btohqsg
I teach them maths.. spot questions for psle.. haha,btohqsg
That is bcos poor or no parenting at home,btohqsg

My Life is just a roller coaster.. 😄😄,btohqsg
Yes lol. I thought you only eating this for dinner I was like huh?,btohqsg
Singapore biz biggest headache n cost are rental n manpower. Give tuition ar students’ home or groups of students at their homes more profitable,btohqsg
Yup! Can be done.. just I choose to let go..Then start for another opportunity haha..,btohqsg
Aiyo you really. Cannot like this leh. Lol,btohqsg
Haha..360 deg change to do other biz..,btohqsg
Ya Lor I so confused by you 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Must think carefully then if convinced move forward bravely aim towards your target mah,btohqsg
Just I listen to God.. he ask me to let go.. will open up another opportunity. Now I still run biz..haha,btohqsg
Why keep change n change within so short time? 😩😂,btohqsg
Hmmm then it is likely God did not prompt you to open tuition centre in the first place lor 😂 maybe you wilfully started it is it? Lol,btohqsg
I try try .. start see how capable m I.. I run 8 moths .. let go teacher n 80 students.. profit already.. more over the sec some changes.. I m not good in sec .. so decided let go..,btohqsg
Ok lah.. have another opportunity for me..,btohqsg
If God confirmed you to start tuition centre then He will surely see you through on the long run mah. And you can just do primary sch students leh. Enough to earn already. Sometimes biz too big is no good: bigger more expenses but profit not proportional. In fact more things to manage. Small is good sometimes,btohqsg
Very hard to look for English teacher..this 8 maths most of them friends n NTU student.,btohqsg
Then God was telling you from beginning no go lor bcos all pre conditions not there 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Bcoz I am Christian too I can discuss this with you like this hope you don’t mind. 🙏😂,btohqsg
No worries.. God love me provide a lot of good way..,btohqsg
God open another door for me.. currently still run the biz.. haha“ Let Go n Let God”,btohqsg
Wow.. in Asia only sg able to do it..,btohqsg
Brother  you are full time trader  or you are broker  got 2 computer screens? Lol,btohqsg
Aren't the school's not doing their job? Still need tutions?,btohqsg
This Huobi is manage by ??china company,btohqsg
Sometimes it is the parents lah. My own view if all parents don’t send their children for tuition then all kids progress by themselves all will hv less stress n save lots of money bcos no competition amongst kids caused by parents. But I suppose this is an inherent Asian issue,btohqsg
Some sch different write up..So Neigborhood sch sometimes did not cover so much.. depending the teacher too.. tuition kid get more knowledge out of the sch.. something will be different,btohqsg
Well it's become an issue! It wasn't like that before. The children going for tutions were considered to be duffers!,btohqsg
Audit laborious job leh  got time to trade? Lol,btohqsg
Audit is simple. Just add all the No's. And give marks one to ten.,btohqsg
