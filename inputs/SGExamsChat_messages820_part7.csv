U believe the latter still benefitted u more?,btohqsg
Yep. In Year 1  I was a project director and in year 2  I was the VP in my facultyâ€™s equivalent of SCI learnt invaluable lessons organising events  working with various stakeholders  and spent many precious moments being with friends whom I still keep in contact with,btohqsg
I just didnâ€™t think I should spend 100 % of my time on acad if I werenâ€™t planning to go the academia path,btohqsg
Oh ya what are u working as now anyways,btohqsg
But i tot all those merits look btr on resume?,btohqsg
Eh  there are things that can be done for personal growth  not just chalking up a beefier resume bahAnyway  I didnâ€™t need a resume back then also,btohqsg
I think it rlly depends on the company. The time I worked in a tuition content development  the boss asked me for a resume but just hired me without a formal interview,btohqsg
I mean tbh at this rate it was like a mash up of an internship and a part time job,btohqsg
But tbh company also quite small,btohqsg
Imagine if the z____ did that lol,btohqsg
Yea  chose that area cus it is the only rhing I can think of that is close to my major,btohqsg
The Workersâ€™ Party will hold its party conference on June 30 to elect a new leadership team that will take it into the upcoming general election.https://str.sg/7xJJ,btohqsg
Will the cockles be there too?,btohqsg
Actly do ppl view him as a populist?,btohqsg
Populist just means someone who is appealing to the popular opinion,btohqsg
Think about it- if his policies were not popular with the people  why would they vote him into parliament?,btohqsg
I tot more like pandering with all big talk,btohqsg
Populist does not inherently mean bad or good,btohqsg
And not as much actually done,btohqsg
this is not my first job but I shall leave it as this bah (:,btohqsg
I know hiscockles will confirm be there.,btohqsg
Then u have retail be like:Are you a living being?You are hired.,btohqsg
It was more of me doing a zoom meeting.This is the route to the place.You are hired.,btohqsg
Lmao my intern did that too,btohqsg
I am like I can commute.You are hired,btohqsg
I remember during my time (seems similar to yours)  the people who were gods of organic chemâ€¦ they started working under the profs like since yr1 or yr2. They knew what they wanted wayyyy early.,btohqsg
Ah the good ole days of fighting with 50 other course mates for the IR and UV spec machines so we can gtfo and go home,btohqsg
Ye  there are those who do UROPS in year 2 or 3. Those who do organic UROPS are very hardworking ðŸ«¡,btohqsg
How many of those machines R in the labs,btohqsg
Oh for ntu we also have that  but we call it ureca.,btohqsg
Apparently is like we can work with professors from other majors or smth like that,btohqsg
(Depending on req of the project),btohqsg
Thatâ€™s cool. Can it be an industrial project besides being offered by a faculty member?,btohqsg
Hmm to be fair  I dont think i have heard of anyone doing that,btohqsg
Most i heard is a math(not nie major) student doing a project under nie faculty member,btohqsg
Icic. I think some UROPS projects could have been offered by industry partners  e.g. food science and tech projects could be offered by external food companies,btohqsg
But Iâ€™m a dinosaur so my knowledge is very outdated la,btohqsg
I have never done UROPS before,btohqsg
But honours project yes you can actually do with industry partners,btohqsg
Cross faculty also might be possible,btohqsg
URECA can be with partners outside ntu but it'd be labs or research institutes of some kind,btohqsg
Only 1 of each for the undergrad labs,btohqsg
Ah yes it's the same for the SEM lmao if u ever do microscale stuff,btohqsg
At least yall don't have 1 single guys job who is to protect that machine,btohqsg
A construction worker was killed and another was injured in an accident yesterday at the Johor Bahru-Singapore RTS Link station worksite in Woodlands.https://str.sg/orvqR,btohqsg
Im in the train and i must be looking v tired and unwell for an old man to approach me saying there are seats behind,btohqsg
I paiseh but now i regret not going to the seat,btohqsg
Or just a kind old man,btohqsg
I think he saw me sleeping while standingðŸ¤£,btohqsg
He was abt to alight then came to me saying there is a seat over there,btohqsg
