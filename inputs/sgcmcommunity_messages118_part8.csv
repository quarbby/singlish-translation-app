Money only what  parf also can.,btohqsg
can save interest keep your car cheaper,btohqsg
Depends on how you want to invest your money. I bought my cars mainly with cash payment without loans. However  most dealers want you to pay more because they don't get the usual commission when a buyer takes a loan. This can be negotiated. I know of few car dealers who don't collect admin fee and don't charge extra for those paying full amount for the car. Cannot name these dealers here as need their permission to do so.,btohqsg
if you buy from direct owners  all that you need to pay is insurance  car and $25 transfer fee,btohqsg
as simple as transfer  the contract you can just use the sgcarmart template,btohqsg
as good as it gets  sometimes better than the dealers,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing about admin fees and other extra charges  I don't know what I don't know,btohqsg
