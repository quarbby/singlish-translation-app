Hi does amex platinum credit card (not the platinum charge card) offers free access to lounges?,btohqsg
Ah the review on Dollar bureau is inaccurate then,btohqsg
You can use heymax to check what cards can be used to earn rewards on whatever product and services you are getting.,btohqsg
Please don't confuse others without checking the context of the question.,btohqsg
Just for context  what's the purpose of topping up Grab Wallet?Only UOB Absolute Cashback Card (AMEX) offers 0.3% cashback for top-ups.,btohqsg
To pay via paynow to merchant,btohqsg
Hi experts  can I ask if there are any other banks that also allow transfer from other banks to them as salary credit? (Other than uob?),btohqsg
@positivevibe009UOB Absolute Cashback Card will be the best and only choice then. You should avoid PayNow if they support card payments (unless they charge 3% for those üò°),btohqsg
Hi everyone  does anyone know the best savings account (highest interest rate) to salary credit? Assuming no credit card spend  no insure/invest etc just purely salary credit,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 gives 3.2% with min salary credit of 1.8k and incremental MAB of $500,btohqsg
For actual no frills (no salary credit  no spending  no insurance  no investing  no incremental account balance)  you can look at:1. Maribank: 2.88% p.a. till end Mar  2.5% after promo ends2. GXS Bank: 2.68% p.a. in savings pocket  2.38% in main account3. SIF GoSavers: 2.5% (thanksJun Hao)For GXS bank  just remember to transfer your monies from main account and savings pocket to earn the extra interest rates.Others you can look at (1.5% to 2.5%  with some transactions or tiering):1. Standard Chartered Bonus$aver (with $3k salary credit): 2.55% p.a2. Trust Bank (with 5 eligible transactions on their card - no minimum spending): 2% for non NTUC member  2.5% for NTUC member3. CIMB FastSaver (tiered based on total amount): lowest EIR at 1.5% p.a.  max 2.5% p.a.4. DBS Multiplier (with salary credit and 1 DBS PayLah! transaction - no minimum spending  based on total eligible transactions): lowest at 1.85% p.a  max at 2.25% p.a.Everything else requires some spending or incremental account balance to get at least 3% p.a. or gives you less than 1.5% p.a.,btohqsg
Can try CIMB Fastsaver    SIF Gosaver kind which is fuss free,btohqsg
I think spend $1 using PayLah on DBS Multiplier also give more interest than HSBC EGA leh üòÖ,btohqsg
I know this month no promo for HSBC EGA but when there is   pretty good promo,btohqsg
Yes boss I will edit sorry sir,btohqsg
SIF is pretty good tho üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª,btohqsg
Agree. Just put FD with them in less than 2mins,btohqsg
SIF  is there fall below fee?,btohqsg
Hi all  What card to use for dining around $5800?,btohqsg
wow what are you eating ü§ë,btohqsg
Oh its with a large grpüòÇ,btohqsg
Split your payment into 3 cards? Haha,btohqsg
Ok haha will try if possible,btohqsg
I would do 3k on UOB lady‚Äôs  2k on UOB VS and remaining on UOB PPV (if merchant accepts contactless payment),btohqsg
If only one card  KF UOB. The unlimited 3mpd for dining is very handy here lol,btohqsg
can consider OCBC 365 CC  5% dining  $160 cashback cap i.e. $3 200 spend. maybe can use 2 of it if u can ask a friend/spouse to apply as well. Havent seen anyone use this here but maybe could be worth considering,btohqsg
Oh actually standard chartered bonus saver is 2.5% for just salary credit  would that be pretty good too?,btohqsg
you want to just park your money?,btohqsg
Nope just for salary credit and emergency funds,btohqsg
Starting work soon need a savings account üòÖ,btohqsg
Standard Chartered Bonu$aver would be at 2.55% with $3k salary credit üëçüèª,btohqsg
honestly parking $ in these kind of things isint worthwhile too   afew hundred a year,btohqsg
Hi all  if I got UOB one account and UOB stash account  does emptying UOB one account by transferring the funds to UOB stash account on 29 Dec 2023 count to be eligible for Rising Dragon promotion?,btohqsg
I mean she's looking for a savings account  possibly for daily usage too. So anything above 2.5% is pretty good already.,btohqsg
"If both belongs to you  then it will count as part of the ""aggregate amount"". Meaning you still need to transfer in from another bank to earmark as incremental funds.",btohqsg
Honestly once you are eligible for a credit card  you should consider opening a UOB One account or OCBC 360 account.Which you are likely to be if you can meet Standard Chartered Bonus$aver account $3k salary credit criteria. But the bank might want to see some income first. üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi have you guys heard about OCBC Premier life Generation 6 plans  is it worth it?,btohqsg
Fall below fee is currently waived till further notice,btohqsg
I'm in the same boat here  starting work soon and looking for the best salary crediting account.Mainly considering between SC BonusSaver and UOB One for savings. Imo  main difference is whether one has to pay 3x bills of $50 each mth to qualify for the higher interest by SC  else UOB One is good enough.I'm also looking for the best credit cards to accumulate miles  esp those with attractive sign-up promotions (I've no credit cards at the moment so will be a new to bank customer). Any recommendations from the community?,btohqsg
If you're just starting work  instarem amaze paired with Citi rewards is the best miles credit card already. Go for that. HSBC Revolution would also be good for new working adults but the miles redemption is only for limited airlines.,btohqsg
For savings account I think the OCBC 360 is best for you because it's easier to save $500 monthly than spend $500 monthly. Just crediting salary and saving $500 monthly will give you 3.2% pa interest,btohqsg
Hi the Webull promo now is it better than the previous one? Just to check the ‚ÄúCash voucher‚Äù is actual cash that can be withdrawn correct? It is not some like voucher to buy shares etc!,btohqsg
Depending on how liquid you need your cash funds  whether you have enough in the account to unlock the higher interest rates i.e. UOB One or OCBC 360  and your appetite for (relatively very low) risk  can also consider putting into liquid cash-management like stashaway simple  syfe cash+ flexi  endowus cash smart  etc.These may be a viable alternative if you check all the salary crediting accounts for your current situation and they give less than 3.5% effective interest,btohqsg
Best card for parking charges and road taxes?,btohqsg
Uob absolute AmexPayPal uob absolute Amex,btohqsg
Huh ? Multiplier interest low right ? Unless can hit your max over $30k eligible txn per month,btohqsg
Any way manage to waive visa infinite sign on fee before? I accidentally sign and they refuse to waive,btohqsg
gold amex only good for 1.6$/2miles  but miles won‚Äôt expire forever  so quite good right,btohqsg
Hi  is it possible to use a credit card to pay for business expenses (rent  salary  carpark)? Just want to rank up miles points.,btohqsg
