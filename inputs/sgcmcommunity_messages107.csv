Oh nice all the coe drop,btohqsg
i still rmb last time 1.88% only HAHHA,btohqsg
Maybe the full loan army will lose some people then,btohqsg
Ya last time change car like change underwear all thinking twice,btohqsg
The rich and wealthy will still change cars like changing underwear. Cars are toys to them. Singapore is attracting millionaire migrants and they will need a car to move around in style,btohqsg
Ya that factor also need to consider. Post covid and geopolitics attracting hnwi like never before. Cars are attracting different group of people. Bottom bracket of car owners now dk want to own car anymore not.,btohqsg
Oct 2021 ocbc still 1.68% 🫠🫠🫠,btohqsg
That’s my current home loan interest LOL😂,btohqsg
now idk i can afford BTO anymore anot is the real question,btohqsg
dun dare mention next car liao wew,btohqsg
ppl gna run to buy car now and then gna shoot up agn,btohqsg
@awj_moodu can change car soon liao leh,btohqsg
If the full loan army was used to looking at interest rates and cared about them  the world would be a different place,btohqsg
5 to 10k drop or increase in COE not that much of a difference to most buying new cars anyway,btohqsg
Neither does it affect the used car market as such,btohqsg
honestly  i assume(DONT FLAME ME) full loan army just whack only. idt interest rates affects them that much,btohqsg
I doubt the COE will drop below 100k as long as the quotas remain limited,btohqsg
does anyone knows where is the cheapest car park in raffles place?,btohqsg
hong leong building after 5 or 6pm is per entry,btohqsg
i think one raffles quay too,btohqsg
why wud u park in CBD anyways,btohqsg
Try using carpark rate app by sgcm,btohqsg
just now i went 80 robinson road. one hour 9 bucks!,btohqsg

JUST HOW MUCH DO U NEED TO BUY FOR GROCERY,btohqsg
And his c63 music system not as good,btohqsg
eh walau u dun tell me u got 1 company van,btohqsg
The nearest would be hong lim at chinatown  they have season parking too. Any other areas within Raffles would be at least a minimum of $3/half hour i think,btohqsg
Just gotta be prepared to walk,btohqsg
Winners faster come down collect your vouchers leh! - J,btohqsg
If you're in the office the whole day  that might be your best bet for season parking. just walk to office and back everyday. If you gotta make a few trips out on the daily then will be inconvenient,btohqsg
that's fine. i can walk to the office building,btohqsg

EV is still impractical to own. Charging stations are so few. Tax rebate is insignificant compared with current exorbitant prices. 2030 target is a big question.

Its only illegal cus of the noise/emissions and stuff which I agree upon. Civic mindedness is lacking in some car owners today,btohqsg

Baller don’t eat food court lol,btohqsg
Steady Ah  next Monday I want one piece,btohqsg
Can eat in baller food court still baller 🤓,btohqsg
Agree with the tax structure. Quite baseless. And brilliant idea for ministers or the entire Govt to be leading the pack with full ev fleet.But if I remember correctly there are more chargers than electric vehicles now. And by average I think most people pump once a week and an ev range is about 400 so roughly charge one a week also. I don’t think it’s hard to charge.,btohqsg
It’s a chicken and egg problem. If not enough chargers  people don’t buy ev. If not enough people buy ev  Govt don’t build chargers,btohqsg
EV cannot be used like ICE vehicle,btohqsg
Must be used with a top up when you can model,btohqsg
If everyone starts rushing to charge once a week,btohqsg
The charger network will definitely not be able to support,btohqsg
Go eat nasi padang  top up in the carpark while you can,btohqsg
But if complete EV adoption happens,btohqsg
Would need parking lots to be full of chargers,btohqsg
Imagine the effect of this on the grid,btohqsg
That will be worst case scenario for people who don’t have charger at home. Wherever u go  got charger just plug in. No range anxiety at all plus got dedicated lots  no need to looks for lots,btohqsg
Which is powered by? You guessed it right  more fossil fuels :),btohqsg
that assumes they are empty when you need them,btohqsg
Tell u the truth  the carpark charges more ex than the nasi Padang,btohqsg
I already say you baller already loh sir,btohqsg
Sia lah now u confuse me.  Not civic mindedness meh? Civic lah!!,btohqsg
Eating nasi padang at@awj_mood's place comes with expensive parking,btohqsg
Dedicated lots right not for EVs when they are the minority,btohqsg
What happens when they're the majority,btohqsg
I think will overstretch  might really short circuit cus sudden surge of power,btohqsg
And malls don't want to put in too many chargers,btohqsg
The simple solution  in theory  is to have moveable chargers along the top of lots so that any car can charge and don’t need to shift lot after charging,btohqsg
Then EVs queue up for lots and us in ICE vehicles get to pick whatever :),btohqsg
A moveable charger is definitely not going to be as fast as a fixed supercharger,btohqsg
Hahaha no choice  was there for event. Tried to redeem parking with my wife member card  but they track her phone location. U must be physically in the mall to redeem the ticket,btohqsg
I mean everyone is free to make their own choices and no right no wrong lah,btohqsg
So clever one???!!!!! What if you download and access her profile using the app?,btohqsg
Can redeem at the kiosk without checking though?,btohqsg
That’s the plan. Hahaha encourage everyone to get ev while I hide in my coal burner,btohqsg
Yeah legit. Of ya didn’t think of that hahaha. Will try that next time,btohqsg
I think last time can  now via app. Never tried before,btohqsg
So I use the kiosk usually,btohqsg

Seen a few Tesla and Taycan groups heading up,btohqsg
For taycans the new Porsche center at JB will help with the fast chargers installed outside the dealer,btohqsg

The rim. Saw it during the video review.White 3.3litre is rare.,btohqsg
Mercedes has an R class? Shit i living in cave HAHAH,btohqsg
No offense doesnt its shape look like the funeral casket car?,btohqsg
Decent car when it was new,btohqsg
Reliable depends on how it was used,btohqsg
The cla shooting brake looks more like one,btohqsg
Recently sell my coe expired car that I owned for a year to dealer and the guy commented that the bonnet change before due to accident after opening it up to check. Wondering how to spot such things?,btohqsg
Any stickers that show manufacturing dates of parts at times,btohqsg
That could mean shit body kit and or shit body kit shop,btohqsg
Really dependent on the car one,btohqsg
Vicom can check if there’s any accidents that happened right,btohqsg
If the accident was previously reported they have the history,btohqsg
Then they check for paint thickness  chassis damage  panel gaps,btohqsg
Hahaha no la. I will see if got any takers here first before listing it,btohqsg
Supper check for a lonely sat night,btohqsg
Waiting for my nasi goreng now,btohqsg

@Xipengstinger 2023 is the last one alr,btohqsg
only 400 available worldwide out of 1k leh.. 400 to US  200 to Korea,btohqsg
This one isn't coming to Singapore apparently,btohqsg
As c&c announced they're replacing the stinger with the ev6 in the line up already,btohqsg
The last unreg stinger was sold recently,btohqsg
The last C&C Stinger was sold already.,btohqsg
All Stingers for SG are on the roads already.,btohqsg
wa i wish i was the 5.5million canberra doode now,btohqsg
Stinger not much ppl buy anyway,btohqsg
It was alright price a year back. 215 999 for a 3.3 V6 & 165 999 for a 2.0It was even cheaper at 2020 for the 3.3L going 160k lowest. I doubt you can find any 3.3L car with that power(365bhp/510Nm) and features set at that price.It was a car not for the masses for sure cause Singaporeans loves their turtle SUV cars.,btohqsg
U are right  ppl either buy suv or nice sport cars. Stinger in the middle,btohqsg
Either ppl buy siroccoo or type r to play or next level is conti liao,btohqsg
But overall kia is a practical car to own for family or daily use,btohqsg
cupra are.. SUVs tho. Different appeal and demography.megane rs maybe but still Stinger is more sedan not a hatchback.Personally would classify those cars as diff target audience. It would be fair to challenge sedan cars to it.,btohqsg
Diff preference for sure. Again I would still say worth the cost back then for it's class & type. Very hard to compare across other types of cars.,btohqsg
STINGER IS A NICE SPORTS CAR!! 🥰🥰,btohqsg
Hanor! It will take 20 years off my age instantly!,btohqsg
Hi got selling Subaru Impreza hatchback auto? I want coe expired longer,btohqsg
There got a lot of expired COE longer cars,btohqsg
Spotted one at my neighborhood. White! Nice!,btohqsg
Super sleek right!!!! When I grow up I also want one,btohqsg
Lol…grow up quickly  drink more milk then,btohqsg
I fell in love with it when I saw it on one of the k dramas I was watching online on some illegal streaming website,btohqsg
I am… but sideways leh 🥲,btohqsg
Bring stinger to ecp and exercise,btohqsg
May i know any one uses stp oil?,btohqsg
I just used Cataclean for my Catalytic Converter Cleaning / Fuel Injector.,btohqsg
I also used Amsoil Engine flush before oil change.,btohqsg
If your car is Ard 2yrs or 100 000kmIt's better to do cleaning of your throttle body  airtake manifold  valve & Catalytic Converter.Market rate $288-$300Walnut blasting or Chemical Manual cleaning(someworkshop using Amsoil Power form) < this is more thoroughSome workshop  use amsoil powerfoam and liquidmoly Catalytic Converter cleaner in the Vacuum tube and rev the engine to clear carbon,btohqsg
Steam blasting the system. Like what they do with oil storage tanks.,btohqsg
Budget decarbon at capsautowerk$38 amsoil powerfoam$68 liquid moly catalytic converter cleaning.Thorough cleaningTry Grand Auto Garage$245? New gasket for intake valve area.Manually cleaning intake valve  manifold  throttle bodyTake out and brush.,btohqsg
I heard German cars like cranberry,btohqsg
TECHNICALLY pops and bangs isnt illegal per se,btohqsg
I meant no Catalytic Converter 😂,btohqsg
Thank you for contributing to the Nation Development 😂,btohqsg
Early morning cold start smells wonderful,btohqsg
Nothing beats the fresh scent of exhaust,btohqsg
Someone should make that into a car scent.,btohqsg
I remember PA told me their tunes are illegal LOL,btohqsg
Smell of exhaust  tar  burnt rubber. Call it… Nurburgring For Life,btohqsg
Or just go JB and clear carbon,btohqsg
People’s Association!!!??? I love the government!!!!,btohqsg
But maybe if I put in my rickshaw,btohqsg
Idk. When I got a quote for an MTM tune  he said won’t pass inspection.,btohqsg
No use if the carbon is hardened already.I see mechanic manually remove it also very difficult 😂,btohqsg
That means it’s a good tune,btohqsg
Maybe this is a FAST CAR THINGS,btohqsg
Won’t pass inspection? OK APPROVED! WHEN CAN DO FOR ME!,btohqsg
VTEC VROOOOMMM PAP PAP PAP PAP,btohqsg

Just ranting....heard some sad news from the recent event last weekend...really make me think Singapore car culture can be more civilized... 😢,btohqsg
It was the Wicked Wallop car event at Carros. One of the bike owner whose bike on display were damaged.,btohqsg
Then Mr Bean Singapore also shared that his Mr Bean Mini Replica have its mirror stolen at the end of the show at Dempsey  Haiz.,btohqsg
yea sorry for making the monday blue worst  folks.,btohqsg
This is why for displays we cant see it up close and it is always barricaded. Black sheeps spoiling such events.,btohqsg
fun news  that Mr Bean Mini replica was barricaded  sort off.,btohqsg
I always believe singaporeans can never have nice things,btohqsg
Yesterday while washing the car  a pink merc suddenly reversed into the bay and my door wasn’t closed yet. The driver still continue to reverse and I quickly ran over to close it  if not sure gone,btohqsg
And parked next to me. Took the hose and sprayed on his car,btohqsg
At least say something like “sorry ah…I need to xxxx”,btohqsg
You can move your car to another lot to dry,btohqsg
normally will do that even if there are no cars coming in,btohqsg
that way you can take your time,btohqsg
I can’t react soon enuff to drive out,btohqsg
I was prepared to drive out and he jus carried on,btohqsg
all the more  need to set good example,btohqsg
Then he took the spray gun and sprayed off and then drove off,btohqsg
Scratch head…and all those while  I was transparent,btohqsg
And what’s up with the barbie pink sia,btohqsg
Very disappointing on the lame ducks,btohqsg
Let him bang. The you claim him.Some people are passive aggressive 😂,btohqsg
That bike won best retro japanese bike,btohqsg
they shud really stop shaking it. No space for the petrol to expand or contract shud it need to,btohqsg
actually they shld drive the car a bit n backwards,btohqsg
maybe can squeeze in.a bit more🤣,btohqsg
they are really ignorant and stupid. dont they know vapor has no way to escape,btohqsg
many amateurs use human feelings or imaginations to think car engines should behave like they think. like drilling holes around thermostat in order to make engine water temperature cold. or disable start stop engine just because they think doing so the battery be bad. but they dont even understand that idling engine is WORSE. that is the reason why start stop is invented to mitigate idling  other than improving fuel consumption,btohqsg
Why u help him wash car,btohqsg
I see a lot of these ppl,btohqsg
My car door opened 80 degrees and trying to put my kid into car seat  then idiot tried to reverse,btohqsg
