Hi I recently submitted my HLE. I provided 3 months of my payslip (Nov-Jan). I received companies bonus in December and January. Does this mean i will get a higher loan since the income i declared for Dec and Jan is higher than my net income?,btohqsg
Bonus is not considered as part of the income assessment for hle  see linkhttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/financing-a-flat-purchase/application-for-an-hdb-loan-eligibility-hle-letter/income-guidelines-and-documents,btohqsg
The more u earn The less grant discount you receive from HDB,btohqsg
Hi  checking.1st questionWe have a Q Number on hand alr. Flat selection date is from March 2023 onwards. Let's say if we looking at upcoming may 2023 sales of balance can we apply at the same time with our bto Q Number on hand?2nd question - if we were called to select our flat before the launch of sales of balance on may 2023. Can we still apply for the sales of balance by forfeiting our selected flat?,btohqsg
1) Can2) Can. Provided you have not rejected more than twice before. If you did then you'll be downgraded to second timer for 1 year,btohqsg
To be specific. If selection date fall after the sales of balance launch we can just apply for sbf then wait for result?If our selection date falls before the sales of balance launch we can secure a unit first? Then come may 2023 apply for sbf again then if get a q number for sales of balance do we need to give up the selected unit to go choose the sales of balance unit? Or can concurrently hold the bto unit while go select the sales of balance unit?,btohqsg
for ehg grant isit both couples must be working for 50k or can be 1 working and 1 not working,btohqsg
Hi guys  is it possible to have multiple concurrent HLE loans?,btohqsg
In general  up until you select a flat  you can apply to any launch (bto or sbf) and as many as you want. This means  if your selection date of your BTO falls after the SBF launch  yes you can apply for SBF launch.However  once you have selected at unit (either through BTO or SBF)  all applications made will be cancelled. In general  you can have multiple applications from various launches  but once you have selected a flat  all other applications will be removed from the system. This means you will lose any queue number you have for other applications.Once you have selected a unit  if you were to give it up  you will be penalised - you cannot apply for any launch (bto or sbf) for 1 year.Tl;dr- you can apply for other launches even while you hold a queue number for a launch- once you select a unit  all other applications are cancelled so you cannot hold a queue number while you already have a unit from HDB- once you select  there's a penalty for withdrawing  which is that you cant apply for other launches for 1 year,btohqsg
Can be 1 working 1 not working. They will just look at the total income between the 2 of you.You can take a look at the example given by HDB on the EHG page  it seems to be exactly your situation  even the grant amount they gave as an example hahahttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families/enhanced-cpf-housing-grant-families,btohqsg
Is it better to buy BTO or resale for single.,btohqsg
BTO  better if u get thru opening booking of flats  shorter waiting time.,btohqsg
Hi normally open booking will be which month(s) ?,btohqsg
There'll be 1 in March. After that dunno.Check out the Open Booking section here:https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing,btohqsg
If property value is $550k.How much downpayment is required for SBF immediate key collection? 20%?,btohqsg
Are you eligible for staggered downpayment scheme?,btohqsg
no staggered downpayment for immediate key collection units. sign lease and key collection is same day. no time to stagger,btohqsg
ooo I see... Means 20% straight with buyer stamp duty  survey fee  HDB conveyancing fees?,btohqsg
What if you're able to pay this part  however you're HLE is unable to cover the balance cost of the flat?Does that mean you can't secure the unit or u have to top up with cash and cpf in the future?,btohqsg
Then you need to top up with cash/cpf,btohqsg
But you're still able to secure a unit during the lease agreement?,btohqsg
Recieved my queue number for NOV 22 sbf for geylang,btohqsg
However looking at the current valuation it's around $500k- $550k for most units,btohqsg
I see... Please do budget according to the completion timeline. Take the earlier date as the completion date so that you won't be caught off guard.,btohqsg
80% of the units are completed,btohqsg
Only with key collection as from what I saw,btohqsg
uh  I might be wrong but I believe the top up is not in the far future  but during key collection.it works differently with bto because booking of flat to key collection is years apart,btohqsg
Ya that's why i asked him to budget according to the completion timeline as it is can be much nearer than a BTO.,btohqsg
I believe as long as u pay the full 20% and with the etc you're able to secure the unit?,btohqsg
Balance is paid with the HLE amount  Enhanced grant and if needed to top up then monthly cash?,btohqsg
Not really knowledgeable on this but base on what I read online,btohqsg
I'm leaning towards no. essentially the max loan amount is what hdb think you can afford to pay back. anything more  it means hdb doesn't think you can pay it back  so they need to see the cash upfront.,btohqsg
monthly cash topups are for people with not enough cpf to pay for the monthly loan mortgage. but the loan was enough to cover cost of unit,btohqsg
So basically ur loan must cover the balance cost of the unit after 20% payment.,btohqsg
Or else we need to pay upfront cash,btohqsg
yes  I think the lowest for Geylang is 498k if that helps and you're ok with low floors,btohqsg
Hahaha as long as have a house immediately,btohqsg
