But at least besides your pw and GP the rest of your tm experience seemed fine,btohqsg
Wait nett 12 right not raw 12,btohqsg
Actually will there still be balloting if the sch is ur 2nd choice,btohqsg
At the end of the day it's just a funnel arbitrary deciding if students are smart or not,btohqsg
It was my 2nd choice  i think i tried appealing also (i cant rmb),btohqsg
Ohh ok  thought it must be first assuming you just meet the cop,btohqsg
And bonus point same as last person admitted,btohqsg
what? so you get into ip and slack for the next 4 years?,btohqsg
2nd choice got ballot anot ah,btohqsg
Or is it only given to 1st chocie,btohqsg
lol how to slack if they mess up they have to retake psle,btohqsg
Yeah thereâ€™s some ppl who dropped from IP cos their gpa not good enough to continue on,btohqsg
And now there is a what now â€˜common paperâ€™,btohqsg
My class had someone from chs ip dropped to o levels then end up a levels did badly,btohqsg
"you can't just say ""oh he's/she's an ip student he/she will cfm do well for Os if he/she had been in the express stream""",btohqsg
What makes you think they didn't retain some innate form of understanding even before.,btohqsg
Wished i just put asr as first,btohqsg
yk there are ip dropouts that did shit for Os right ðŸ’€,btohqsg
But i heard the proportion of people who enters the sch at the last cop is damn low,btohqsg
Hard to tell if it wouldâ€™ve went better tbh,btohqsg
No my point is that then the measure is fucked up,btohqsg
But at least for GP it wouldâ€™ve I guess,btohqsg
It could boost my chance of entering asr a lil,btohqsg
Because u are rewarding those that slack off and last minute just do well cuz innate ability,btohqsg
that's psle bro  but how would we know if an ip student is STILL ACADEMICALLY STRONGER than an express student come the o levels?,btohqsg
I mean if you had gone to asr instead of tm,btohqsg
But then again proportion of ppl entering at the last cop is v low,btohqsg
since they don't have to take Os,btohqsg
Oh I can just ignore the rest because meritorious as it is I made it,btohqsg
you can't compare y1-4 results with the freaking gce o levels,btohqsg
It is coz the merger did not went well (which is something I obviously would not know when applying),btohqsg
ok ykw i have the sticker for you,btohqsg
I think merger basically screwed over all the merger schs,btohqsg
I don't even get the point of exams and rankings,btohqsg
Yeah but u have to recognise that the system we created ain't exactly fair too,btohqsg
But I guess asr still better than tm  itâ€™s just that in particular for you  since your grades at tm turned out fine at asr it might have been worse,btohqsg
Im not sure if it is consistent across all mergers but tm has a disproportion of teachers fr tpjc,btohqsg
Like you may not have had that magic Econs cher,btohqsg
With lots of drawbacks which we will or are already experiencing,btohqsg
but when you say you don't want elitism you have to put in action. but clearly our learning system hasn't until fsbb. and the implementation of fsbb did not completely solve the problem yet,btohqsg
Oh well that sucks. Itâ€™s just like how at asr the srjc chers pull things down,btohqsg
Erm i think we should not look at it that way coz my magic econs cher was fr tpjc,btohqsg
There is the issue with sinkies like bedok. Let's make this clear. This is a white paper we identify issues that require solving and let decision makers solve the issue,btohqsg
Ok but on average Iâ€™m guessing mjc departments wouldâ€™ve been better,btohqsg
If we don't even identify the issue then they won't even know,btohqsg
I can only speak for that few subjects i take,btohqsg
Then u have kids like bedok just saying cry about it as if that's gonna change shit,btohqsg
i do agree that psle being what allows people to bypass o levels completely is a bit meh bc you're 12 when taking that test,btohqsg
but blaming it on elitism is just,btohqsg
I can safely say that math and the sciences  defo mjc has a better department  econs  tpjc has a better department,btohqsg
