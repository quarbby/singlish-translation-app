earn krisflyer miles directly added to krisflyer account,btohqsg
So if I use the card to pay for dining  how does the 1.2 mpd appear ?,btohqsg
Will be credited beginning of next month in your kris flyer account,btohqsg
I know if pay from kris+ is direct,btohqsg
Hi if i transfer miles point from krisflyer to kris+  which is better in term of value for money?,btohqsg
Have anyone pay atome using uob ppv? Do i get 4mpd if i do so?,btohqsg
Just want to confirm that using CRMC to pay for favepay is eligible right?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone encountered delay between activation of uob ppv card and adding the card to the apple pay? I activated the card this Sat morning and still unable to add to apple pay. Hopefully it is not due to maintenance hours.,btohqsg
hi everyone  if i apply for UOB Krisflyer Credit Card just to pay roughly $1k+ of Scoot purchases per year  is it worth getting the card for this and will I be granted fee waiver for $1k annual purchase on that card only?My current miles strategy :1) UOB PPV Card for offline purchases2) UOB Ladyâ€™s Card (Transport) for simplygo and taxi rides3) CRMC for online purchasesLooking for a miles card for travel related purchases,btohqsg
Hi guys  if i have 170k  2 person to alternate account   which is the most optimal way to optimize my interest.1. Put 150k in UOB one  spend 500  credit salary  remaining monthly incremental goes into ocbc for salary + save 500.Or2. Put 100k in first ocbc  spend 500  credit salary  and repeat the same in another ocbc account..I am just a little bit skeptical about spending for ocbc as their cards are pretty bad  canâ€™t really justify especially on the miles,btohqsg
But i just need to put in after 30 days right? So if i have 2k in the account and i put in 150k after 30 days  then ear mark the 150k  does it mean i am only getting full interest for the 148k?,btohqsg
Transfer Krisflyer miles to krispay miles is a drop in value by itself. What are you trying to achieve?,btohqsg
Can we still get max miles by paying income tax via axs using chocolate finance?,btohqsg
Too many cards to follow already. Keep it simple,btohqsg
UOB one account normal interest rate is based on total monthly average balance (mab). You will earn interest on 150k MAB.30 days?! Are you referring to UOB quarter bonus interest promo?,btohqsg
Yea quarter bonus  i took out 150k from my uob one account at beginning of the month  in anticipation of the new quarter bonus interest.,btohqsg
For that promo  after 1 month of keeping ur balance low (2k mab as you mentioned )  you will need to top up 150k in during the promotion to get the highest bonus  i.e. 152k balance.,btohqsg
"Assuming both humans have HSBC EGAs  the best scenario is to rotate 170k between both accounts.Else option 1  BUT different.For UOB One account  pay at least $500 on any eligible UOB credit cards to clock spend while self crediting salary. Possibly join the quarterly promos for extra ""bonus interest"". This 150k is FIXED  do not touch the money ever.The rest of the 20k goes into A's OCBC 360 account and spend on A's eligible OCBC credit cards. Following month  move all the monies to the B's OCBC 360 account  and spend on B's eligible OCBC credit cards. The salary credit to UOB should be from the human's account doing reset month.",btohqsg
You still can fix it. If you calculate correctly you can drop your MAB to around 1k+ and participate the promo with 150k with minimal excess earning 0.05% p.a.,btohqsg
Thanks  i am okay to spend UOB 500 per month  even with 2 different UOB accounts  UOB cards spend are easier to hit with all the miles promotion  wouldnâ€™t UOB one be better account than HSBC EGA in terms of interest return?,btohqsg
UOB One needs to be at 150k to get 4% p.a. without the earmark promo (highest liquidity) and with spending required  while HSBC EGA has higher limits at 3.9% p.a.  with some transfers that's all.,btohqsg
Imo yes  UOB one is better in your case. For some other people with higher amount of funds  HSBC ega has higher cap.,btohqsg
Hmm then in that case is there any sign up promo right now  cause Chrisâ€™ & Kelvinâ€™s links from their EGA videos are apparently not active anymore,btohqsg
Link there for EGA also inactiveâ€¦ guess no one has one active rn,btohqsg
Very weird mystery. Why that stupid clause,btohqsg
Yeah  No EGA active campaign for now,btohqsg
Hi which other credit card can earn more Krisflyer miles? Currently holding Citi premier cc and hsbc revolution card. Switching between both cards to buy online  made merchant payment and pay bills online.,btohqsg
For HSBC only need to alternate between 2 accounts every month? And can earn 3.9%?,btohqsg
Must sms in correctly at Correct month,btohqsg
Hihi  is anyone using DBS yuu card as an everyday use card? Any feedback? Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s a good substitute to replace the amaze card. I usually paired with Citi rewards card,btohqsg
yuu card only good for the few yuu merchants,btohqsg
see how often you visit yuu merchant eg giant  cold storage  toast box etc,btohqsg
What are you spending on?This video has some useful information.https://youtu.be/COvLCoKj554,btohqsg

Hi everyone  can anyone share which platform offers the lowest fees for RSP on Irish-domiciled ETFs? There are several options  and I'm a bit confused. ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
anyone stuck cannot withdraw money from chocolate finance???,btohqsg
Hi gurus  how do we use ShopBack if we wish to check out multiple items from Shopee in one single purchase?Iâ€™m aware that for HeyMax  we just need to click through HeyMax for each item before the final checkout  and the HeyMax system is intelligent enough to track all the multiple items in the Shopee cart.Does ShopBack work the same way? The ShopBack terms and conditions are not entirely clear for purchase of multiple items in one Shopee cart. I need to consolidate several items in one cart in order to hit a Shopee voucherâ€™s minimum spend.Thanks for any help!,btohqsg
Even though they say need purchase all from the same shop  but my experience is even if you selected other items from different shops in your cart  still able to earn cashback for those items. YMMV.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn. Did you have to paste the unique link for EACH of the items from different shops?,btohqsg
Without pasting the unique links  the cashback is only 0.1% as opposed to as high as 10%.,btohqsg
It's up to 10%  not guaranteed 10%. Even if you used the specific unique link. The one on unique link I got 1% while the one I didn't use the link I got 0.1%.,btohqsg
Uob lady card earned uni$ will accumulate with UOB PPV?,btohqsg
Yes UNI$ is pooled  so you can also cancel one card and still retain the pool,btohqsg

There is a new offerring from Syfe (hmsg.link/syfe) that allows irish domiciled etfs. Good for small amounts (Less than $800 per month)For bigger amounts  prefer to go throughhmsg.link/ibkr,btohqsg
To enjoy the ocbc credit card promo  the 1 qualifying transaction must be $800 within 30 days of card approval  or the qualifying transaction can be any amount? Thanks,btohqsg
Looking at syfe  they only provide 8 etfs ?,btohqsg
Most of the essential ones are covered already,btohqsg
