I think mcc still remains the same. So depends on what you‚Äôre spending on?,btohqsg
So i think revo still got little use... since more and more merchants getting that,btohqsg
But yes... mcc still matters at the end of the day,btohqsg
Isn't that considered as contactless ü§î,btohqsg
Nope... u are using online app which is considered online spending still... jus the mcc we cant avoid that,btohqsg
New business idea for fintech engineers  create something similar to amaze but for visa then y‚Äôall can earn big bucks le,btohqsg
Some people think no card present means contactless?,btohqsg
Well‚Ä¶ if heymax actually creates a card  not a bad idea for them too. Whenever someone spend on a merchant  the mcc code automatically updates their back end database  making their mcc search more accurate. This can even into details on different branch of merchant,btohqsg
You don't tap. How is that contactless?,btohqsg
don't think heymax needs any hinting for a card  making an auto MCC routing card was their initial goal,btohqsg
What does auto mcc routing card mean?,btohqsg
Pretty interesting concept but I think they still have to get MAS approval and license etc to have this launch.,btohqsg
With the card maximizer I think they are massively collecting all those mcc when we are spending on ü§î slowly fine tunning their backend,btohqsg
Yea I do hope so. It‚Äôs a great app just that the mcc data is not very huge  especially those lesser known. But the only visa supported seems like it will slow down the progress,btohqsg
Is the moneybull promo worth to put now? And if I were to put sgd and how much is needed to hit the 100k usd mark?,btohqsg
Gurus. If top up panda pay wallet is it considered as rewardable transaction?,btohqsg

Hi  can hsbc revolution stack with amaze? Or no point?,btohqsg
visa card cannot stack with amaze,btohqsg
Uob count by single day balance for the promo.. so i tot it was same for the hsbc ega. üòÖ,btohqsg
Adb  Mab is same concept  just different way they name it,btohqsg
uob also count incremental wrt Mar MAB,btohqsg
Single day balance is used for qualification or referencing. But never used to calculate the amount of interest paid.That‚Äôs what a couple of jokers misinterpreted Cimb bonus interest calculations.,btohqsg
Not anymore. That's a last year thing ü§™,btohqsg
Thanks gurus for clarifying. So i shall do the transfer out elsewhere and transfer in on 1st july. Thanks for advicesüôè,btohqsg

Hello can anyone here just help me clarify can i use my citi reward cards to pay atome payments and get the miles ?? Or should i link it with amaze and do payments to get those miles ? Thanks,btohqsg

Anyone face this issue ?First I had key in the credit card A on the payment transaction page in Jetstar website  But when I type the card number   there got deduct sgd 1 and refund back the SGD 1But suddenly need add one more person for the air ticket  and I no proceed for the paymentAfter I purchase one more  person air ticket then at the end I use another credit card to purchase air ticket as the credit card can get the point to redeem some rewardThen three hour later   my credit card A suddenly have the transaction LOT INTERNET POLAND around sgd 700++I already dispute the transaction  is it able to get back this money?,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt sound related to Jetstar.More likely is you just unlucky get fraud transaction or your handphone got malware.Did u report to your bank already. If it is non OTP verified transaction likely can reverse.,btohqsg
I report to bank already but is it need to report police?,btohqsg
See what the bank says first. If bank requires police report they will tell u.So far if bank reverses there is no need to report police.,btohqsg
