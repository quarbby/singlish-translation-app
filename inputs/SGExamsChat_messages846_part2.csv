Wat abt h2 math  fmath and h1 econs?,btohqsg
math should be updated i guessH1 content can don't bother if u score As for H2,btohqsg
you can redo your A Mathsjust search for syllabus and look out for assumed knowledge within the syllabus,btohqsg
those are parts from A Maths where they assumed u to know well,btohqsg
For math subjects  i recommending starting practice earlier,btohqsg
Especially when in J2  you could start on pure math topics while your tutor proceeds to teach stats portion,btohqsg
For h1 econs  if you are just plain ass tired writing full length sentences  I recommend writing in point form. Most  important is to get the key points (not recommended for hw tho),btohqsg
