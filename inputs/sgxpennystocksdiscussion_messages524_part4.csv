Ask Pika Nat Series #5Question: What is your take on the latest job data?The Jobs We All LoveWe had the much-anticipated Job Data. The economy added 235 000 jobs in August which is far below the economists' estimate of 750 000. This hints on an on-going labor shortage and that the Delta variant continues to hit on labor market recovery.The Good SideThe increase was the smallest since January. Investors cheer as it reduces the worry that central bankers will accelerate the pace of bond purchase tapering. Market participants can therefore give greater trust to Uncle Powell's pledge to keep interest rate low for a long period of time and that itself is a cushion to the stock market.S&P 500 and Nasdaq welcomed the huge miss as they rose immediately after the data was released.The Milky SideThe enthusiastic buying slowly faded as market opened lower after investors dived deeper into the data. Although unemployment had fallen to a new low of 5.2% from 5.4% in the prior period  we see weak spots on multiple fronts  suggesting a tight labour market.When economists think about the best equilibrium  the simple analysis of supply and demand becomes a valuable tool for simplicity as a discussion. Pika World believes that the current state of the economy points to a more significant issue in labour supply than labour demand.First  the labour participation rate held at 61.7%  given that the labour supply had shrunk. Most economists had anticipated a mild increase. This is worrying. Consistent with our previous writing  we would have expected that the expiration of the enhanced unemployment benefits would have motivated people to return to the labour force to earn an income. Unfortunately  the data does not reflect such a reality.Considering that labour force participation was at 63.3% before the pandemic  it seems like the recovery pace is slower than we aspire. Moreover  the most significant hit sectors such as leisure and hospitality saw employment stagnant despite employers' strong desire to hire more workers.PayDay Come on!Yes  yesterday update did shed some discussion on wage inflation. The latest data indicated that the average hourly earnings rose faster at 0.6% from a 0.4% increase in July. On a yearly basis  wages are up 4.3%.Again  this is a surprise since economists had expected wage inflation to cool down as more people return to work. Nonetheless  with some levels of delay in returning to work due to Delta variant and embedded labour economic structure such as early retirements  Pika World believes there is increasing upward pressure on general price inflation.Settling at SomewhereCollectively  the latest data shows that prices may move north faster than the pace of labour market recovery. However  given that the Fed has been emphasising more on labour market progress over the inflation concern  Pika World believes that the Fed is unlikely to make a move on tapering in September and a reduced probability of a November taper.After all  the latest report further cements the most significant threat: growth might be slowing and swirling.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg
