In any case just go statista lol,btohqsg
p sure nofutureofryan doesnt know anything,btohqsg
if he did id be worried,btohqsg
but i know how to look,btohqsg
Can i get into uni without amath,btohqsg
but no math courses for u,btohqsg
but if u taking alr dont drop,btohqsg
its so much easier than e math tf,btohqsg
emath is out to fk u up,btohqsg
am i supposed to self learn it,btohqsg
https://www.aceninja.sg/assets/files/fairprice-consultancy-report.pdfor maybe these type of reports,btohqsg
ya depends what course also.. end of day if youâ€™re poly  the relevant course will teach you whatever is necessary to enter Uni.. and then for jc that one idk the rest can answer for you@silentvelocitygiving me flashbacks ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
err since you alr dropped den just leave it be.. if you go poly   youâ€™ll learn whatever is  necessary for Uni  considering u meet the course prereq.. then jc self explanatory la.. some course in uni got subject prerequisite for math  iirc like h2 math must get C and above I THINK ONLY AH,btohqsg
but bro if Iâ€™m being honest  just focus on your o levels  jc or poly. Thatâ€™s all that matters rn,btohqsg
donâ€™t care if need amath   can always private candidate,btohqsg
ðŸ˜ƒ thats what my ft said to me when i consulted abt post sec,btohqsg
yeah.. trust me your goals will change,btohqsg
before sec 4 i say iw go poly then halfway say wan jc then halfway just sticking to poly,btohqsg
if u intend to do engineering... u can skip basic math for poly,btohqsg
so really  just focus on o levels.. uni is far far away,btohqsg
i mean she dropped alr .. not as if thinking of dropping or not,btohqsg
err different ba.. whether can grasp the differentiation and integration then will be easy,btohqsg
Or else become like me.. a2 drop to b4 because mind  blank for ALL the integration qns,btohqsg
i saw my friend do graphs for amaths,btohqsg
that shit looked like someone forgot how to draw a straight line,btohqsg
integration kinda confusing at times especially when trigo is imvolved,btohqsg
actually i cld do the trigonometry one.. just that the NORMAL integration I think I just lazy as fuck so i didnâ€™t bother to practise..,btohqsg
wah but so fucked up to think about it.. paper 1 80% .. paper 2 idk.. but lost around 20% la..,btohqsg
so u can do trigo integration but cant do the normal oneðŸ’€,btohqsg
ya bro idk my brain funny one trust,btohqsg
usually trigo one is the one out to fk ppl one haha,btohqsg
anything with trigo is fking cancer,btohqsg
HAHA i only got the hang of trigo in august?,btohqsg
tot trigo is sec 4 topic,btohqsg
i think i need to get a tutor for physics,btohqsg
what engineering course u in? always see u need do thermo,btohqsg
wah i see u study im like â€¦ i honestly got nothing to study.. just complete projects..,btohqsg
tot chem eng more physics lol,btohqsg
wow the difference between engineering and business students,btohqsg
literally this sem its like engineering math  mass energy balance and thermodynamics and organic chem,btohqsg
material engineering they ask us remember metal structure we all sian alr,btohqsg
then this other like fundamental module,btohqsg
cannot imagine learning chem again haha,btohqsg
literally 3 of my modules are math,btohqsg
standard. engineering need alot of math,btohqsg
u just flip thru ur thermofluid notes,btohqsg
cfm plus chop will see alot of differentiation and integration,btohqsg
ur workdone formula also derive from integration one,btohqsg
is like a to f to z,btohqsg
idk what shes doing then i have to figure it out myself,btohqsg
