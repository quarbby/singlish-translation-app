Schrodinger's problem we are all bad at physics the moment of observation,btohqsg
Shld have just gotten mc chicken,btohqsg
A place where history is made,btohqsg
The kind that many will remember fondly,btohqsg
to ask your kunji how old,btohqsg
The pinnacle of art and literature is made,btohqsg
What does kranji and kunji mean??? Idk,btohqsg
How can i ask your appa??? 👁,btohqsg
U r not talking to my oppa,btohqsg
Steven lim kor kor is mine,btohqsg
Lestin :( Si Yan rejected me 😭,btohqsg
im grading your shit next sem,btohqsg
He legit gonna talk about how bad my exam skills gonna be,btohqsg
I walk into any tests/exams with a blank mind,btohqsg
I don't even know what it entails,btohqsg
U aren't supposed to do that?,btohqsg
There can be 5 questions in a finals,btohqsg
I tot u had to be calm in exams?,btohqsg
And i wouldnt have a final answer for all 5,btohqsg
Actly can u mutliply vectors in e math,btohqsg
Hey a pass is a pass..,btohqsg
For some reason there can still be people doing worse than me,btohqsg
Even ntu h3 semicon if i wanna do electronics?,btohqsg
then what are you doing with that combi fam,btohqsg
Wdf how tf am I a nerd,btohqsg
useful for knowledge doesn't translate to useful in admissions compared to just having a high RP,btohqsg
I am far too retarded for that,btohqsg
also ntu h3 semicon is more on the actual physical mechanisms of semiconductors which engineering doesn't actually go that deep into,btohqsg
it's really a condensed matter physics thing,btohqsg
Why have a High RPwhen u can just have Si Yan,btohqsg
I cant rmb the engineering course i wanna take but i think theres one thats more specified in semicon oso,btohqsg
yeah i heard it’s better for someone with a ↑ rp but with 0 h3 than someone with a ↓ rp but with a h3 distinction,btohqsg
applications on the usage and functions of semicon is different from the underlying physics of it,btohqsg
RP is temporary Si Yan is eternal,btohqsg
Shit rp doesnt translate to bad uni experience,btohqsg
Then look at me (im still having a bad uni experience),btohqsg
If i had a good rp i wouldnt be in physics,btohqsg
none of my group of friends had >80 RP but end up all at least second upper,btohqsg
I mean maybe u changed courses,btohqsg
Who knows maybe u did it for Si Yan,btohqsg
one of them <70 RP then NTU first class  halfway through undergrad got MOE scholar now doing PGDE,btohqsg
Meanwhile me:When I graduate  unemployment awaits,btohqsg
After going through uni for 2 years,btohqsg
Its genuinely not that hard to do well,btohqsg
Just need to be consistent af,btohqsg
But being consistent is probably tougher than the content lmao,btohqsg
i think that applies for our course but for others idk,btohqsg
The most anal thing is admin,btohqsg
i heard from my ft that jc is the tough part,btohqsg
Okay i guess i can only say for physics,btohqsg
