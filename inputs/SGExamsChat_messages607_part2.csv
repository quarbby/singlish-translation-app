Better to talk things over irl than online at this point,btohqsg
I thought about this and I asked my friend,btohqsg
Why is this my problem to deal with?,btohqsg
Again  this being the fact that my girlfriend has fucked 20+ people,btohqsg
If she's lying about this I'm worried she's lying about more things,btohqsg

He recognised her from a mutual friend,btohqsg
I asked her about it and she told me this,btohqsg
Dude did she act like nth happened and casually talked abt it like any day to day conversation,btohqsg
I mean she didn't bring it up until I asked her,btohqsg
How did she react when she knew u knew,btohqsg
