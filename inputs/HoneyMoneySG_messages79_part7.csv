oh yes correct  i think to close need to contact customer service to manually close for you,btohqsg
Ok. I‚Äôll keep calling them until can get through‚Ä¶,btohqsg

Hi all  just curious  with the nerf to hsbc revol mcc on travel services  in Jan 2024  if i were to use it to pay for Klook/KKday now  will i still get the reward pts since the transaction is done this yr?,btohqsg
Simple. Credit 500 on first day of the month only works if1. 1st day on the month is a working day.2. Last day balance of last month is same as last month's MAB.A lot of people ignored the 2nd criteria and assume last day balance is the MAB  which is not true especially if you have big withdrawl last month.Just log into ibanking  if you top up some amount on 1st day of the month and no withdrawl or deposit after that  ibanking should show your current MAB compare to last months MAB  just top up/withdrawal based on that amount x number of days passed in the month.,btohqsg
Hi Guys!If my major spending is for Google ads  what would be the most suitable credit card for me? With no max capped. Looking at miles card,btohqsg
Yeah  just use excel to calculate your last month's MAB and make sure this month MAB is at least 500.1 above last month MAB. I have been using this method on 360 account for years and never miss the SAVE bonus.One thing to note: include last month's base interest for last month's MAB calculation.,btohqsg
I thought if I don‚Äôt take out every month interest then it shouldn‚Äôt make a difference,btohqsg
Not only the interest  I believe you have other withdrawls last month.Your balance on 30 Nov is not the highest among all the days in Nov.,btohqsg

may i know which bank savings account good for foreigners working in sg? thanks,btohqsg
No. It does not work perfectly if you don‚Äôt withdraw. You will hit max $100k faster n required reset more frequent than others. It will also ‚Äúdisturb‚Äù your MAB amount n become hard to monitor manually.,btohqsg
Ok I guess that‚Äôs what‚Äôs been happening‚Ä¶ so if I withdraw on same day as the day the interest comes in  will be ok?,btohqsg
Withdraw on same daybefore 6pmis my personal rule but you can withdraw before 9pm. Don‚Äôt forget to withdraw all other transactions too on the same day such as salary n refill the gap caused by giro if you have(not recommended to use giro deduction on this account). Paynow also another leakage that will disturb your planned MAB.,btohqsg
if you plan to have credit card with min spend 500  you can open uobotherwise ocbc 360 is good,btohqsg
Hi all  just wanted to check if I use the amaze + Citi rewards cart out from cash converter online website will I earn 10x point,btohqsg
Hello  we need 5 testers for the new year mode  we are meeting a deadline and need to check how rewards are given out  are there any bugs etc. Of course everything is paid  email me with questions,btohqsg
Hi all  just want to get some opinions.. I first started trying to invest in stocks in POEMs then now I am using Moomoo for S-REITs .. can I ask if it‚Äôs better to stick to moomoo or Poems if I want to buy Stocks like DBS or OCBC?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGAssuming I hit both BHS and FRS and continue topping up via VCMA which will supercharge my OA  do I still get tax relief for my VCMA?,btohqsg
But if top via via RSTU there will be no tax relief,btohqsg
Base interest is count as the last day of the month or 1st day of the following month?,btohqsg
Credit at first day of the month but value date is last day of last month. So counted as part of the balance for last month.Always look at the value date.,btohqsg
You can't withdraw the base interest on the same day. It will be back dated to last day of last month.,btohqsg
ok so i think what i did wrong was that i did not withdraw the interest on the same day and also i did not withdraw my pay on the same day,btohqsg
So both deposit push up your MAB for last month  that is why your last day balance is less than the MAB for last month.If you don't withdraw on the same day  you need to withdraw more at a later day. Need to excel to calculate.,btohqsg
ya #2 very tricky..coz it's MAB via every end day closing..btw..Do u know if end day balance ..they use current balance or available balance?TYIA...,btohqsg
Not specific to OCBC  but I know a few other banks are using current balance. So OCBC should be the same in this case.Eg. UOB One account after earmark 100K  the available balance maybe only $100  but the bank still uses account balance ($100 100) to calculate the end day balance and calculate interest.,btohqsg
thanks for ur thoughts..think UOB do that coz even funds are earmarked..they still give interest payouts..,btohqsg
I know at least 2 other banks use account balance to calculate interest too. So likely OCBC are doing the same.,btohqsg
last day can still throw in..to pump up MAB..but must calculate the prior days in front..add up and take average...then will know last day need to pump how much..but play safe.. I'll pump 2 days before the last day,btohqsg
Hi. Does anyone knows possibility on purchasing SIA Kris flyer miles ?üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi  I had applied for iChange physical card since 14 Nov  however  until now i haven't receive it. Anyone in same situation?,btohqsg
Same. I even earlier than u a week.,btohqsg
oh thought my request was somehow being missed out. So how do you use your virtual card when overseas?,btohqsg
Can I ask if I use Mastercard to top up amaze wallet  any fees?,btohqsg
Same. Must have a alternative. My missed out almost 20 request at different timing worst rates vendor.....,btohqsg
Most people will recommend low cost option i.e. Moomoo etc because lower cost maximise gains.I prefer a traditonal broker with shares in CDP. Hence i use Phillip Securities' Cash Trading account. No bells and whistles with a fixed broker. I also pay for shares using a credit card so it is akin to an extended settlement for me.Some use FSM to buy SGX shares at $8.80 commission (if i remember correctly) and transfer shares to CDP,btohqsg
Yes. Base interest can‚Äòt be withdrawn on the same day. I think the impact will be lesser since it is on last day of the month. So using $600 to top up has less hassle n low probability of not get the saving bonus because the safety buffer is wider. It Allows as much as $100 of difference in MAB.,btohqsg
