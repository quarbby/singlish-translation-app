The wife of the Singapore Police Force para-veterinarian who tested positive for COVID-19 was among the new community cases. The 28-year-old Singaporean  who is a Prison Staff Officer  had already been placed on quarantine after being identified as his close contact.4.

Yea üëç respect all views and react accordingly if prices go against your view,btohqsg
If it goes your way  great. Great win.  If it does not   then cut first perhaps . I have big positions in Aspen now. For me I fee   the players are aiming up. Question is when. Sooner or later. By the time they move up will be when many are fearful and already sell back to them .A few reasons.- young CEO   go getter . Knows exactly what he wants. Gets into glove business . Opportunistic.- secure $100 m US deal even before their factory set up.Aspen gonna be a more interesting and popular counter . It is gearing up to be so and stocks are about perception. BBs will be interested to play this one because the more retailers the better,btohqsg
Bear flag have upswing by going down...just sell during swing up,btohqsg
ISDN bosses took in a disinfectant business which got many interested (BBs especially). Took time but see where they are now. Was vested years back in Isdn   $0.20 And it was like a dead fish. Things only got interesting when they took the disinfectant business .Similar to what Aspen is doing and planning on doing . For me  It points one direction.,btohqsg
true it will take many months to prosper~,btohqsg
Disinfectant business gd..before cny and covid,btohqsg
Yea  let‚Äôs see how it goes. I have set aside cash to hold this one.Hope it goes to plan.,btohqsg
Aspen pattern like to shoot up on news and cool down.....be shooting up again on next news,btohqsg
The CEO will bring a lot of catalyst to the table . We will see. He knows the game . Play along will do .,btohqsg
If wrong or market suddenly bad. The set up bar  still cut and re look perhaps.See BBs. Now it‚Äôs BBs playing . Most who bought already buying and just watching.,btohqsg
All the recent buying they do. 255 mouth etc.,btohqsg
If got stop loss   any trade can play,btohqsg
SgYuanthank u master yuan for the chart,btohqsg
Whatever the Aspen CEO is doing. Really respect ‚úä considering his tender age. A force to be reckon with. He gets it done   no doubt. This kind of person gets shit done  whatever it takes,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the kind of person we need on the team,btohqsg
Unlike some ceo that plays fb all day,btohqsg
Aspen good prospect be patient it will go 0.3 and beyond,btohqsg
Maybe more tg contracts will go to other manufacturers,btohqsg
