Ey hi it's u again haha,btohqsg
Tesla owners blast Christmas car charging chaos with dozens of electric vehicles forced to wait in THREE HOUR queues at charge stations across the UKhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11579649/Tesla-owners-blast-Christmas-car-charging-chaos-dozens-forced-wait-THREE-HOUR-queues.html,btohqsg
Funny how the other day everyone was queueing for fuel cause of a shortage..,btohqsg
1st tip. It’s bimmer haha but who cares  bmw sounds better,btohqsg
how much shld i expect to spend yearly on maintenance for a conti car like merc or bmw? looking for a basic car to drive but at the same time got some want to try out smth else other than jap cars,btohqsg
If you choose the right one,btohqsg
You’ll be spending less than a honda 🤭,btohqsg
either> one month of $3.50 chicken rice everyday> one month of 98 petrol everyday,btohqsg
Sometimes it’s better to trust a car sold by an enthusiast cos he/she probably take better care of the car than the normal people.,btohqsg
If u are looking at coe cars  I think merc will be a safer bet,btohqsg
@arnavgulianimight be able to help better,btohqsg
Does this rare Pokémon frequent Simpang Bedok? Cos I’ve seen one there,btohqsg
ohhh the one i knw is a white GT,btohqsg
Some people tell me the in-line 6 is apparently such a creamy sounding engine. Don’t know if true or not,btohqsg
A lot of people zeng until the whole car is just.. exhaust,btohqsg
A stock M3 sounds nice. A stock 335i is just.... Anemic,btohqsg
A stock M3 with an exhaust upgrade will be heavenly though,btohqsg
The e9x m3 exhaust is actually a bit raspy and leaky sounding,btohqsg
You might be interested in a trumpet 370z then,btohqsg
I like loud cars but I also like having money in my bank account,btohqsg
I have heard an e9x before,btohqsg
Too loud means burn too much petrol,btohqsg
Not if you're in a chopped pipe vios/cs3,btohqsg
I also like to stay on the safe side of the law,btohqsg
Can teach me your secret sir?,btohqsg
Not bad leh. I heard NA IL6 before especially from the previous series before they switched to mainly turbocharged 4cyl,btohqsg
Kor kor next time bring me go listen also leh.,btohqsg
espc when they got eventuri bits,btohqsg
Interesting question.. what do the merc boys do for intake etc ah?,btohqsg
the secret is to not have a loud car,btohqsg
I KNOW I KNOW!!!! Some people go Nasi Padang bo jio,btohqsg
that’s the only one i knw,btohqsg
Oh the na ones yes  creamy sounding. The turbos not great  or maybe cos mine was modded,btohqsg
I think I need go Nasi Padang stall and camp,btohqsg
Leave only the right ones to stay and come,btohqsg
Kor kor there got many many chairs 🪑,btohqsg
Wah bojio I want to camp to see also!,btohqsg
