Want to ask   the grant amount stated on website. For example grant amount is $20k  cfm is $20k or (up to) $20k which might be lower ? The chart didnt state (up to) though,btohqsg

Hi all  I‚Äôm a full time student and HDB HLE asked me to submit the past 6 months of income/payslip letter and 15 months of cpf contribution  I thought I just had to submit my student pass?,btohqsg
Does your other half have income at the moment? Submit his/hers and u submit your student credentials and cpf contribution history as supporting.,btohqsg
when selection  Payslip need original or photocopy will do?,btohqsg
Ok thank u very much as today go selection.,btohqsg
Yeah he‚Äôs working and I‚Äôm a student so I submitted his payslip and cpf when we applied for HLE. The application also asked to just upload my student pass which I did. Then today they messaged me asking me for further supporting documents for my cpf and payslip üò≥,btohqsg
Cause I am also working part time while studying ft and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôll affect getting a lower hdb loan . Hmm,btohqsg
Just provide cpf docs and explain that you are not earning an income at the moment and does not have any payslips. It could be that the system is replying rigidly when the usual documents are detected as not sent.,btohqsg
U applying for hle for the purpose of unit selection only right... Not key collection.,btohqsg
Yup for flat selection in August,btohqsg
can get grant unless your partner earns > $9k!,btohqsg
Should I just make a call to HDB ..? Since I have to reupload the application online I don‚Äôt think we can not upload the documents just like that üôÅ,btohqsg
U can  but they probably will just ask u to upload the cpf docs for their records,btohqsg
Okay  thanks for your help! I‚Äôll just call to clarify first. Thanks üòÑüôèüèª,btohqsg
Nice location. I noticed the stacks are about 14 to 16 storeys. Are the projects there all about this height?,btohqsg
Also  this is my first time applying and I got a really nice number. What else should I prepare myself for (in case I missed out from hdb website/blogs) after selection of unit and paying 2K cash? Sorry if it‚Äôs been asked a lot here,btohqsg
actually can just go to the selection without any document except your IC  just tell the staff on spot you are a ft student,btohqsg
Oh can ah? The website says I need to upload the doc by July but unit selection is on Aug.,btohqsg
Hi  Have anyone come across  or heard of young married couples who apply for Public Rental Housing? (Not the Parenthood Housing Scheme),btohqsg
You mean the 2room flat for those without kids ? And 3 room if have kids ?,btohqsg
If so yeah I know a couple who got married and applied that public rental flat,btohqsg
Yup. those 1 room or 2 room. but Married couple without children only can have 1 room,btohqsg
Oh yes . 1 and 2* mixed up,btohqsg
i see. i mean  the application requirement states can apply even if household income is more than 1500,btohqsg
did they receive any kind of like interview  or phone call to assess eligibility?,btohqsg
cos the way HDB website wrote about this scheme  is more like toward elderly whose children cant house them. haha,btohqsg
They just had to submit their income documents. At that moment only 1 of them was working so they only had to submit the working one   the other was unemployed .,btohqsg
Actually yes. It‚Äôs more for those who can‚Äôt really afford the housing tbh... and the housing locations are places where most elderly stays,btohqsg
Because they won‚Äôt be eligible for housing if their income exceed the cap  so if yours exceed I don‚Äôt think you can apply for it.,btohqsg
ya that true  but i went to see some of the location and google map it  some blocks not so bad (not those with inside loong long coridoor kind),btohqsg
Thanks for some insight Shar :),btohqsg
Im trying PPHS at the moment. haha,btohqsg
homes  which is a basic need  shouldnt be so expensive  hais,btohqsg
all boils down to 'your vote matters',btohqsg
Hi  can I ask  I just received a email from hdb asking to go down to choose a unit for Nov sbf. If I will to give up the chance to go down  will it affect my chance in the May sbf?,btohqsg
Yes. If u do  u will lose one of your two First timer status.So if u do get to select a unit for may sbf  that is your last chance as a first timer.,btohqsg
Thanks! So before my selection date  if someone else choose the remaining unit  and I don't get to choose anymore  my first timer status will still remain right?,btohqsg
