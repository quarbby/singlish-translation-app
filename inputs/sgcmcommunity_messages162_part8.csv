Why risk kana caught for low fuel? Plus the tolls. Plus the jam,btohqsg
Time too precious to be wasted,btohqsg
Unless gg JB whole day or w a purpose,btohqsg
If nt go in pump n come back is a waste of time,btohqsg
I still in my dream land,btohqsg
Wah. Quite a small tank you have sir,btohqsg
I got more than  1/4 tank left,btohqsg
Up to 25% if used Citi,btohqsg
I not sure isit applicable for PHV one also ?,btohqsg
How fuel tank work? My Altis supposedly have 55L capacity but yesterday night I go pump petrol it is slightly below 1/4 to full tank I top up only 38.57 L . If I prorate like that then my full tank is only 50-51L 🧐. Is the other 4-5L for the reserve tank?,btohqsg
When the gauge shows empty you should still be able to go 30-50km,btohqsg
Yellow light comes on at 10-15% of remaining fuel,btohqsg
But not really good for engine I heard,btohqsg
Best practice is to go pump when light comes on la  but no issue to drive another 20-30km usually,btohqsg
But don't be like some people who love living on the edge,btohqsg
Alot things in life not good for engine but we still do it anyways 🤪🤪🤪,btohqsg
If u really scared just pump when it hits 1/4 lo,btohqsg
Usually I pump when it hits 1/4 or below,btohqsg
As long as it doesn’t left with empty then still ok,btohqsg
Wah which dealer is it now,btohqsg
(For subscribers) A Porsche Panamera owner lost $135 000 after vehicle dealer 360 VR Cars took over his car and became uncontactable.https://str.sg/i545,btohqsg
More than engine not good for your fuel pump,btohqsg
Engine is still getting fuel as long as there's a bit until you run completely dry,btohqsg
Running dry is the one not good for engine,btohqsg
Just pump when you're at half or quarter tank,btohqsg
Especially if you're pumping at the same pump all the time,btohqsg
I probably phrased that wrong... pump when light comes on or before,btohqsg
Eat before you’re hungry and stop before you feel full,btohqsg
petrol is petrol  even pump at different stations also doesn't matter,btohqsg
I think same goes for petrol,btohqsg
nonsense  unless you eat in JB  must eat until the food can see coming out of your gullet,btohqsg
anyone who says they go JB never pump full tank to the brim is lying,btohqsg
Because if I shake my car  suddenly got extra 5l of tank,btohqsg
