Basically all these jobs(Grab  taxi  Foodpanda etc)  is using your time to exchange for money. Working as part time is ok.Full time  not advisable esp if you are young age,btohqsg
Yes true however   age dosent matter   if delivery is your forte than u can give it a shot.. some drivers earn more than employee in the corporate world.. only setback is tht this is not permanent and also there are no benefits unlike in a company  not forgetting this is also a self business so how much u sow is how much u reap,btohqsg

Those if have family to feed n support then have to work doubly hard or have other job I guess. Cos cost of living now is so high,btohqsg
Can't run away from that fact. Fly to Australia or enjoy the sufferings here. You will live a full life sharing those stories with your grandkids someday.(If we ever have offsprings) Lols!,btohqsg
Anyway nowdays I see most families both hus n wife work combined income shld b ok. Although no job stability n insurance n cpf etc but there are perks also. Flexibility is a big plus for me. Cos I need to look after oldies etc,btohqsg
