Spend less time on road = less emissions,btohqsg

"yeah see   we all own cars . some cooler than others . but if you have more power   you have a nicer car   stating "" 70whp "" is just not the way you talk about other's whip brother",btohqsg
sorry  no offense but are you power shy,btohqsg

U don‚Äôt deserve to be in the scene if ur ego has a bigger size than ur engine,btohqsg
lol  whp or torque doesn't matter in this country,btohqsg
it's shitty enough to have the coe system,btohqsg
cos it‚Äôs genuinely hard to over take in an attrage compared to a m3,btohqsg
you get rewarded by the fact that taxes are low,btohqsg
the only real things that matter in sg,btohqsg
and you can park your car wherever,btohqsg
I'm not power shy . I'm just saying man   car scene . be respectful and mindful about what you say on other's whip .. you could offend ppl without knowing,btohqsg
more cause if you can work remote and stay out of sg for more than 180 days,btohqsg
then don't stay in malaysia for 180 days too,btohqsg
it's time to be a digital nomad,btohqsg
lmao  to own a car is already good enough here,btohqsg
to get your feelings hurt because of that,btohqsg
if people find it shit  so be it lol,btohqsg
can i put wrx stars on my levorg,btohqsg
