Huh. Who says I am a BB. It seems like no one believes I am a BB except you? I am no guru. By funds I mean my own funds. When I first started to have buy calls for MC payment  I said I will pump in $100k in it. Which BB only play with $100k - $200k? You have a loser mentality and need to grow up.,btohqsg
Individually  we are always the minority in this game... Collectively we can become stronger,btohqsg
I thought sinkie pawn sinkie is a myth sia.. Now I believe liao,btohqsg
Someone once say.. sinkies are highly judgmental and highly sensitive  not a good combination,btohqsg
Okok.. Psps.. Stir finish liao haha.. Continue to vent your anger.  I like to see actually,btohqsg
U meant we are small retail investors individually but are BB together? 😂,btohqsg
I come in to see quarrel nia.. Stock call long ago doing myself liao,btohqsg
Ya.. Fun leh.. Don't know why.. Maybe I sinkie also😂😂,btohqsg
"I really appreciate when people in this group share their ideas and plans... it is always a ""sometimes win  sometimes lose' situation  even for those commercial ""professionals""  where we have to pay to receive such information",btohqsg
To summarise  risk management is impt.,btohqsg
we are all old and experienced enough to know not to follow anything blindly...,btohqsg
Exactly. If people come in just to follow calls from people here  then I really have nothing to say except that they really need to formulate their own trading plan.,btohqsg
sometimes I want to share some crazy ideas  but scared people here scold me for losses,btohqsg
Yea  this group is open to all talks . Giving views and all that is fine  if explicit using this group to induce  pump & dump  we will remove.Anyways  I’ve been advising from day 1   the importance of SL. Really have to manage one because market can turn anytime,btohqsg
Peace.Maybe i have talk too much as see many ppl commenting their positions.I will just be a silent reader.,btohqsg
any idea on the support level or cut loss strat?,btohqsg
Nor matter what  trade with your comfort zone n logic. Do some homework..everyone have knowledge to share.,btohqsg
I also loss a few k on Mercurius following goldilocks  but I don’t mention and move on.Have to take responsibility for own decision.Everyone wants to win but must be prepared to lose if the counter price go against,btohqsg
Honestly I added more earlier 67. My earlier lots all in CDP already.I’ll fight for a bit more.If market good and this one still sleeping/ I find a better opportunity  I will cut and switch,btohqsg
Some counters like Chasen   FA wise is okay  I am not too worried if they drop as long as can hold.,btohqsg
Anyways  always DYODD and self manage the SL to each risk preference.Blaming is no use one. Want to do well in stocks  is understanding and taking responsibility,btohqsg
Nice investment bro.. Hidden dragon sia.. Isdn n frencken... Multibag till siao.. Grats,btohqsg
your brain stops working when your heart takes overthese losing/wining emotions are our own inner demons to tame...,btohqsg
This episode shows one should1) have one own trading plan2) TP and SL3) always cross check with own strategy.Trading alone is a lonely journey. It’s good everyone here has each other for companion. Let’s go on and pick the next winning stock,btohqsg
1 way to tame these feelings is to let it out somewhere... like here 😂,btohqsg
