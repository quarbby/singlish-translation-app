need to start studying for alvls,btohqsg
the topics that are not covered in n level syllabus ill self study them on my own,btohqsg
if need help can ask in the help groups,btohqsg
dont ask caleb soh though ü§£,btohqsg
yh my friend created a study group chat and im the only NA student in there,btohqsg
so i can just ask the express students for help on topics not tested in n level syllabus,btohqsg
You are one in a million,btohqsg
most of the friends are from express,btohqsg
i usually am not friends with NA ppl because i sort of don‚Äôt fit in,btohqsg
I usually am not friends with anyone because i dont talk,btohqsg
the only ppl im friends with from NA are ppl who have good grades and etc,btohqsg
they do i chain thing and claymore,btohqsg
i love it when claymore goes off,btohqsg
U wan can ask me abt chinese,btohqsg
im trying to take a math in sec 5,btohqsg
Can feel the shock wave when the tank rounds fire,btohqsg
my math was grade 1 all the way in sem 1 but then sem 2 pulled it down a little so it‚Äôs grade 2,btohqsg
e math  combined physics/chem  combined ss/hist  poa  chinese and english,btohqsg
it‚Äôs quite an unusual occurrence to take a new subject in sec 5 so im working hard for emb3 raw 5 for prelims,btohqsg
anything the possible only your mind limits the possibilities,btohqsg
I should have studied more in lower Sec,btohqsg
U will say that when u go poly,btohqsg
im attempting to finish the whole n level syllabus for math by february before oral and lc prelim starts atm,btohqsg
chem and physics might need more time,btohqsg
‚ÄúShould studied more for year 1 sem 1‚Äù,btohqsg
you can do that when you enter y1 in poly,btohqsg
at least you won‚Äôt make the same mistake,btohqsg
maybe after poly I can try the SAT who knows haha,btohqsg
if you can do o levels you can also do SAT,btohqsg
I heard that sat is easier than Os for some math questions,btohqsg
the reason why a lot of ppl can get near perfect score is because the SAT is too easy,btohqsg
sec3s can already get above 1450,btohqsg
All the best mei mei üòÅü•≥,btohqsg
if u r good at o level math it‚Äôs not hard to score 800 for math. think the topics are more or less the same as o level math  except maybe complex numbers but these are foundational level qns,btohqsg
yeah. sat max is 1600. 800 for reading and 800 for math,btohqsg
hm i heard the reason why US unis put so much emphasis on portfolio is because the SAT is really not that rigorous  so many people can get 1600. Thats why they need extracurriculars to differentiate the applicants,btohqsg
While UK unis care most about A Level grades becaude the A Level is academically rigorous enough that it alone can be a sufficient measure of whether the applicant is suitable for the specific university.,btohqsg
actually not really sia. u score 1550+ u are alr 99+ percentile,btohqsg
yup they look at your portfolio and essay the most,btohqsg
hm true but US population is v big,btohqsg
that‚Äôs the hard part of us college admissions,btohqsg
so theres still a sizeable no. Of 1600,btohqsg
also they look at your race,btohqsg
how is asrjc? does it have a bad rep?,btohqsg
depends on when you start ig ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
yeah but us standard not high lol,btohqsg
u dont believe u can go see the papers  especially math,btohqsg
i mean in terms of preparation for the actual exam,btohqsg
i mean let‚Äôs say if you‚Äôve been doing pretty shit in all of ur subjects,btohqsg
a levels standard but the qns set are too easy,btohqsg
