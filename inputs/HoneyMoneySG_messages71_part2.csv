"Guys i need help. I called UOB earlier but doesn't sound convincing.So basically i have already hit the min spent and salary credit to get level 2. (7%+  interest)But my level 2 still pending. Called uob. They said my ""salary credit"" reference put Sep salary. So UOB cannot accept.Is that really the case??? I mean i receive my salary at first week of the month. So of course my salary credit is for previous month",btohqsg

Guys  are there more flights slots when you redeem return tickets compared to booking two one way tickets?,btohqsg
So on 1 Feb withdraw everything excess of 100k?,btohqsg
but if we just withdraw the excess from 100k  we just stand to lose 1.5% in Feb and still can get 3.15%pa in Feb. So if we take 100k and whack 26-27 days of 3.7% from MMF and then redeem and move back. It can be quite a bit of effort and need to time right cos redemption might take a few days depending on weekend to get funds back. so can be quite risk. so forsake the 1.5% might save the hassle.,btohqsg

FYI reminder to Amaze user to disable the overseas spending and/or online transaction whenever not needed (or block the entire card if not used frequently). I got 3 fraud transactions from online spending with a total of USD $700++. The scammer somehow managed to bypass the OTP (txns were approved before the OTP came).I can tell you dealing with instarem support is not fun (chat only  response is a bit slow although still somehow acceptable). And unlike bank  they dont provide temporary credit  so I need to pay the bill first (linked to citi rewards).They managed to get the chargeback from the merchant  but its only about 60% of the total bill now(seems wrong communication on either instarem/mastercard/merchant side.This is still ongoing. Hope I can recover the rest.,btohqsg
There is an option to raise dispute request in citi app  they will provide temp credit while the investigation is ongoing,btohqsg
I did raise it to citi  they said I need to block and replace the citi card. But instarem said I dont need to do that because the fraud is with instarem and not citi. They will take care of it.,btohqsg
