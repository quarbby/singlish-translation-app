which to take? h2 geog or econs,btohqsg
Eh what uni course uw go,btohqsg
It'll be easier if u have a rough idea already in mind then you look up on it,btohqsg
no plan in mind.. maybe not even local,btohqsg
biz or law sorta thing perhaps,btohqsg
Ahhh I'm not familiar with overseas lol,btohqsg
geog and econs no pre-requisities to uni courses lol,btohqsg
and probably all other arts subjects,btohqsg
Law is just glorified sales job,btohqsg
h2 geog i heard is very content heavy but i think new syllabus got content cuts,btohqsg
i econs major so of course i will reco h2 econs lol. if u wanna know more about how the world works,btohqsg
Can't confirm for H2 only h1 mb,btohqsg
But ya they cut by a,btohqsg
I heard ppl say that ntu econs more theory heavy than smu or smtb,btohqsg
Ya only uni pre req ik of,btohqsg
I can't rmb if it's h1 or 2,btohqsg
idk how smu is like but i think it‚Äôs ok leh lol. plus ntu microecons 1 is a joke. some chapters cover really little content. plus microecons midterms so easy still got ppl cheat and the sch is not even doing anything about them. then microecons finals only test 5 weeks worth or content lol. 2.5h paper i finish in 50 min lol,btohqsg
Wait what's the cut off for,btohqsg
u in a level write like dog for 10m meanwhile my final can write 2 lines for 10m alr,btohqsg
ohh u considering ntu econs ah. but dont be fooled by a level econs into thinking this is what econs is actually like. uni econs is a whole new ball game,btohqsg
even from uni econs prerequisite alone. u can see they no need econs but need math lol,btohqsg
Nus need go chs and tbh,btohqsg
I just considering social sci in gen ah,btohqsg
Ya I heard alot of graphs and stats and calc,btohqsg
yeah. there are ppl who cannot tackle the mathematical demand of uni econs then they drop out in y2 lol,btohqsg
I say this cuz I think stem is too competitive and idh enough passion,btohqsg
While arts like hist n lit...,btohqsg
ok la depends on what stem also,btohqsg
I not in arts stream for a reason la,btohqsg
Engineering is basically out for me cuz I don't have any Phys bg,btohqsg

But I basically laughed it off,btohqsg
Cuz I'm thinking why tf I get this even tho I have no Phys bg,btohqsg
if u thinking of ntu psych i can help ask my friend also,btohqsg
Its ok la like i always say engineering easy to get in,btohqsg
And thing is almost every course need some sort of maths,btohqsg
