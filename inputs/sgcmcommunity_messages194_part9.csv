Very long never drive NA le. I like havin a turbo now😂😂,btohqsg
Why u look down on NA!,btohqsg
The 325i I assume is the E series  the 2.5L inline six actually provides quite a sublime experience,btohqsg
Turbo cars aplenty in the market. But cheap fun and reliable  will be a hard one,btohqsg
U got to give up something,btohqsg
Just very long never drive alr,btohqsg
Haha yeah with turbos cars these days are so much easier to drive. But I would say the e chassis is solid  plus rwd. Would be fun to drive despite it being NA,btohqsg
If not enough  got for the m3 4.0 NA hahaha,btohqsg
