Then you can visit UOB Stash website and enter your Dec MAB on the calculator  the website will tell you how much Dec interest you will get. I think it is less than 1.5% of interest compare to 3% if you placed it for 1 full month.,btohqsg
My credit strategy is use Uob ladies solitaire for food and supermarket. The rest with Citi rewards plus amaze. Cancelling other cards for NTB status for new sign ups.,btohqsg
1. shopee and lazada2. no DFI. Sheng siong  NTUC. nO DFI shop nearby.3. 900-1k,btohqsg
Buy from overseas if buying diamonds. Much cheaper. Can just ship to sg,btohqsg
hi all  im very new to this so pls excuse me if my question is very dumbim currently looking to apply the UOB ladies solitare i might be abit late bc the 6 miles per dollar only for another two months do you all think i should even bother with applying for this?I currently just applied for the UOB krisflyer bc of the sign up bonus  but i dont plan to use it as my main mile earning strategy  im quite lost on what i should do next :(Should i just go with the citi rewards+amaze combo?(my lifestyle is mostly spending overseas and on travel  im barely in sg)thank u in advance!!,btohqsg
Uob lady at 4mpd still very competitive.,btohqsg
after feb itll be back to 4mpd is it? i mightve been confused by the description,btohqsg
Nothing confirmed yet. We all crossing fingers. Sigh,btohqsg
got people sell voucher on shopee also de,btohqsg
"also i talked to the UOB credit card advisor person and she just say ""ohh what where u hear one  no ah  itll stay 6mpd forever"" : ) i didnt know they can just spread misinfo sia",btohqsg
let just assume that if they dont extend the 6 mpd the old earn rate is 4mpd for bonus which is a decent card also,btohqsg
Just apply lo  since alr got kf uob. All under uob  can get all the cards then wait and see if they extend the 6mpd,btohqsg
and she also say theres no such thing as overseas spending surcharge (like the extra 3.5%)so after talking to her and doing all my research i came back even more confused,btohqsg
shopee is 8.33% lazada 3.33%shengshiong ntuc   3.33%you take your previous statment and calculate if more than 40$ cashback based on the spending then if more than 40$ get the UOB one,btohqsg
u can consider buy ntuc and sheng siong voucher from seller on shopee instead,btohqsg
i have been using uob lady before the promo 6mpd  4mpd is good and uob pool all rewards earn under different card together which is a super big plus point for me.,btohqsg
oh damn! okok thank u so much,btohqsg
At the rate men are using likely will be nerfed but let‚Äôs see how lo,btohqsg
promo stated till 29 feb 2024 so have to wait till then to see if it will be extended,btohqsg
Yeah enjoy till the last promo day,btohqsg
i have a few big purchases coming up  i guess ill apply and save to use it when the card arrive before feb bah,btohqsg
Which brokerage is good for trading penny stocks? Recently noticed that Syfe started adding some hidden fee ($0.003 per stock) for stocks below $2 charge,btohqsg
Riding on this question  I created a stash account le but currently is $0 in Nov n Dec... I parked all the funds currently in GXS to recieve 2.68%Intend is to only trf in 1 lot $100k when I accumulated to full 100k to stash on 1st day of tt fateful month  is this thinking sound?,btohqsg
Stash account calculates interest base on tier n MAB. GXS calculates interest based on end day balance.You need to calculate when is the best time to switch.Anyway  GXS max amount is $75k  beyond that you need to find a new ‚Äúhome‚Äù üè¶ for your savings.,btohqsg
Confirm no. Only if your MAB is 100K then you will get 3%  since you put 100K now but transfer out after 25 Dec  your MAB will not be 100K then you can look at their tier interest. But confirm not a pro-rated 3%.,btohqsg
For Stash account  1st month seems to be special. Eg. If open account on for example  5th of the month  and immediately 100K in  I think the MAB for that month will be 100K and not pro-rated. Happened to me when I opened my Stash account in July. I thought need to average out so I calculate nicely and dump 110K in  then MAB for July becomes 110K instead of 100K..,btohqsg
HI guys which CC still recognise insurance premium as eligible transactions? Does UOB One Account count tat as part of the $500 spend?,btohqsg
How about the Travel spend though?,btohqsg
Can try üíµ ProsperUs Code: HONEYMONEYSGhttps://hmsg.link/prosperus0.06%  no min for SG Stocks,btohqsg
UOB One account yes  not the CCs,btohqsg
Dont think there is any good promotion to pay insurance premium now..NVM  i think this is the best for now-https://milelion.com/2023/10/18/citi-payall-offering-1-8-mpd-on-all-payments-buy-miles-at-1-2-cents-each/,btohqsg
Is it you can get $1250 monthly interest with trust bank if u deposit $500k with the new 3% interest rate?,btohqsg
Travel spent have to plan ahead using the Uob solitaire choosing food and hotels category. With the 3k limit can preload supermarket gift card then next quarter moved to other categories,btohqsg
Is it true the webull new account sign up promotion is any amount? I put S$10 also able to receive 10 stock ranging from $8?,btohqsg

For cashback  I'm thinking of testing a strategy of Maybank Platinum Visa + ipaymy/CardUp.Note: This is all just theory crafting  nothing is tested yet. Also thanks to Mb for rejecting my application previously  so I couldn't test this.With the latest changes to Mb Platinum Visa  insurance premiums can only make up of up to 50% of the eligible spending of the each tier.Using 2k tier for example:First 50% (1k): Charge the card directly.- Premium paid: 1kSecond 50% (1k): Charge via ipaymy  with promo fee rate at 1.79%.- Factoring fees to hit 1k  premium paid: 983- Lazy method  ignoring fees  premium paid: 1000Total premium paid per month: 1983 / 2000Fees paid per month: 17 / 17.9Total eligible spending: 2000 / 2017.9,btohqsg
