A Honda was reverse parking into a parallel lot opposite Beauty World Centre when a Jaguar suddenly entered the same lot bonnet first resulting in a 20-minute standoff that saw the police called in.➡️https://bit.ly/3OMpMEgFollow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates,btohqsg
Jialat.🤦‍♂🤦‍♀ auntie lot kena snatched. Just move off and don't block traffic mah....scold that Jaguar guy when car not blocking traffic.🤦‍♂🤦🤦‍♀Later no more parking at Tiong Bahru Market 😅,btohqsg
Hahahahaha looks like it’s that Jaguar guy who is the problem lehhhh. I love how the writer went “luxury car” … Honda already very luxurious for me worrr!,btohqsg
Yes but nothing you can do.Singapore don't have law for parking lot snatching right?Auntie block the entire road.Delivery rider/ driver all stuck.Other customers leaving also stuck,btohqsg
That place the parking already very limited,btohqsg
Food also not very delicious.Unlike nasi Padang,btohqsg

Interesting question #2: what if the situation were reversed ie the Honda lady was trying to snatch the lot from the Jaguar driver? Wonder how the headline would have been written and general reaction.,btohqsg
Approach nicely  if he got attitude then let karma take over,btohqsg
Or hopefully his car can’t start 🤭,btohqsg
