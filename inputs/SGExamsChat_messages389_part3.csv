1st half do paper2nd half redo it,btohqsg
yes üíîüíî den go jc still need A1 ü§¨ü§¨,btohqsg
I ever had a pure physics student  chemistry was F9  physics was B4 at prelimsThe school asked her to drop to combined sci ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
let's say comb he get 6 den phy abt same same den end up get 5 for one subj,btohqsg
ya lor. Schools sometimes no time to look at individual students to give the best way forward,btohqsg
she ended up staying in Pure?p,btohqsg
I calculated for her  best case B3 for combined sci but worst case B3 if just take physics,btohqsg
drop also no point  if chem is f9 means basic fundamentals also dh means comb sci also cannot do wot...,btohqsg
it's just basic things that makes sense,btohqsg
it's a generally IP sch that has O level track,btohqsg
but I think prelims and O level time the teachers no time and energy to sieve through her stuff to think through,btohqsg
the inviligilation duties can be quite taxing,btohqsg
but then also  dropping right bfr olvls is q risky.. student wouldn't know what is tested or not  not used to the rigour of the sci pprs,btohqsg
bcz sci pprs can be q repetitive  if the student continuously do pprs from 2 months prior olvls. sure can A at least B3,btohqsg
you are so much more clear headed than the teacher who advised her,btohqsg
hi guys  may you all help me to fill this quick survey,btohqsg
@lolreallyysurveys only allowed on our discord under our dedicated surveys channel,btohqsg
Hi I can just say for my sch laEach pure sci have 3 hrs of lesson per week,btohqsg
Pure humans also 3hr per week,btohqsg
Electives have 1hr 40 mins of lesson time per week,btohqsg
Imo the pacing was q ok,btohqsg
U definitely need to do review,btohqsg
It's not as scary as ppl make it seem to be and if u like sci in gen rly just go for it,btohqsg
what happens if we skip chi paper 2,btohqsg
ya but honestly idk why i retake eh i passed already,btohqsg
Cuz this exams grade considered void,btohqsg
my chi has been bad all the while la but i don‚Äôt think i can do better this time,btohqsg
I think my Cher said they just take the btr one,btohqsg
so if i skip then totally voided is it,btohqsg
bcs i heard some say they will do moderation,btohqsg
Iirc seab policy is if no valid reason,btohqsg
The moment u skip 1 paper,btohqsg
wah okayü•≤ my sign to go and js anyhow do i guess,btohqsg
ya cos idt i can do better this time lol probably worse,btohqsg
harh wtf how long is one lesson mines 1hr interval,btohqsg
I mean bcz you're used to it ah... sec2 to 3 might be a lil diff,btohqsg
My sch timetable is by 20 mins block,btohqsg
So some classes r 40 mins,btohqsg
our h2 math kiddos are done?,btohqsg
I was rly scared as shit,btohqsg
But for me it got easier in urrr,btohqsg
well for me  I was consistent.. consistent in slacking  but combined was q easy to pick up again in the last 6 months so üëçüèº,btohqsg
i till now also very consistent,btohqsg
but i work hard when needed aye,btohqsg
Just that it's gonna be abit more cancer...,btohqsg
bro i flunked o lvls bro,btohqsg
But generally still am pro pure sci,btohqsg
i one stupid fuck buy 2 bio tys  did both  and like can do everything so üôèüôè,btohqsg
HUH NO I BOUGHT TWO OF THE SAME COMBINED TYS,btohqsg
bcz I was that slack I didn't know what I had what I didn't,btohqsg
