if u ask me  vrs is just a even more practical cheaper gti,btohqsg
I told myself 11k depre was out of my budget,btohqsg
I mean in current market vs what it’s worth,btohqsg
But u lose the hot hatch boy racer look,btohqsg
now idt is right time to change car sia haha,btohqsg
in current  market everything also overpriced,btohqsg

That’s why if the civic is sold,btohqsg

During that time it was 80k ish only,btohqsg
in singapore market everything will forever be overpriced,btohqsg
Stinger 3.3 20k depre worth it,btohqsg
I cry myself to sleep everyday now,btohqsg
the depre worth it but the road tax is not,btohqsg
Ok la  for the performance  it’s hard to get low road tax,btohqsg
Maybe move to aussie open nasi padang shop there,btohqsg
Best other option is the ea888 VAG cars,btohqsg
stinger is twin turbo or js one turbo,btohqsg
yeah cheapest road tax for a twin turbo v6 alr,btohqsg
The $245 678 not sold yet,btohqsg
even cheaper road tax for v6 would be porsche alr sia hahaha,btohqsg
