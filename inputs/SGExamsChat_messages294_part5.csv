Wait lmao guys just checking for the el essay q6 was discursive ah I wrote as argu bruh,btohqsg

wah i opposite with u I write q5 as argumentative,btohqsg
cause they say how far u agree right,btohqsg
Cause q6 said what r u views isn't that discursive die liao,btohqsg
yea but actually if u wrote 2v1 ure fine,btohqsg
i hv! but its summarised version tho if udm,btohqsg
qn6 was how far u agree,btohqsg
qn5 is what r ur views,btohqsg
So for like q6 I wrote 2 point 1counter then rebut,btohqsg
Wait isnt it what is your opinion,btohqsg
argu is usually opinion and disc is usually a facf,btohqsg
qn 6 is a opinion so its argu,btohqsg
that's what I thought.... wait isn't qn 5,btohqsg
Oh ok thank God tks tks,btohqsg
yea qn 5 was like young ppl r changing the world for better wht r ur views,btohqsg
they asked for your views but tbh expository and argumentative,btohqsg
2v1 is fine as ling as u have strong points,btohqsg
I wish i could unsee the messages,btohqsg
ik qn6 was how far u agree,btohqsg
that means qn5 is argu and qn5 is disc if you say it like that,btohqsg
5 is what is your opinion,btohqsg
6 is what are your views,btohqsg
wait wasnt it like how far u agree?,btohqsg
yea but generally its askin for YOUR opi or like ur stand,btohqsg
no qn 5 is young people r changing the world for the better so its an opinion because its not a fact,btohqsg
that's why u say qn 5 is opinion  and u also said opinion is argu,btohqsg
okay thank you for the reassurance!,btohqsg
np ngl ive been doung that forever regardless whether its expository or argu,btohqsg
as long as thr is a contrast between ur stand and ur like ‚Äúrebuttal‚Äù,btohqsg
so if u write all 3 positive then gg to uü§°,btohqsg
nope mine is stand 1  stand 2  counter-argument  rebuttal  conclusion,btohqsg
But can also be 3 positive,btohqsg
if its argu like qn6 and u write 2v2 then might b some prob,btohqsg
You need counter argument then rebuttal,btohqsg
yea but to that u oso have to counter,btohqsg
like u say so positive right thr has to be like,btohqsg
