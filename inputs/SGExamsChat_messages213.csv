Guys should I throw away my A Level school notes? Cannot giveaway/sell due to copyright so uploading is not an option but like... do people keep their notes until they get their results,btohqsg
for me i still keep some. the rest i just throw,btohqsg
a lot of others do the same  or sell or give to juniors,btohqsg
Do people usually keep in case they need to retake?,btohqsg
Idk like what if I throw already then be like shit I don't have anything for 2021 A Levels,btohqsg

The thing is ...I want help but rn I can't even cope w my own emotions rn,btohqsg
Only throw after results release LOL,btohqsg
haha yea rn I just stack up and leave it in a large neat pile,btohqsg

Unless i got it wrong all this time....,btohqsg
I could finish allll the qns i chose,btohqsg
I mean tbh the qnd were all SUPER WEIRD,btohqsg
Im glad lah bc that means the split will be more even in a way,btohqsg
Dude i was so stressed for this,btohqsg
okay one last day tmr aite,btohqsg
and then it'll all be in Cambridge's court,btohqsg
Math was bad stress bc i sucked. But i got proven wrong and i can passEcons was terrible stress bc i suck. But i could somehow do them?Geog was HORRENDOUS STRESS Bc i suck. But somehow I CAN REMEMBER?,btohqsg
Even the topics i DID NOT TOUCH FOR 2 MONTHS i could write about,btohqsg
My cohort and i spotted the exact opposite of what will come out,btohqsg
I heard history was a blessing this year,btohqsg
Math was the one subject I was proud ofI screwed up big time for GPIdk how literature wentHistory paper 1 I was literally s------- (not kidding) after the paper  paper 2 was a lifesaverEcons CSQ clownEcons essay saved paper 1,btohqsg
overall  Cambridge pattern paper 1 troll paper 2 save,btohqsg
Oh ya lit.......... i thought it was well-tested,btohqsg
Not too hard not too easy,btohqsg
Not a lifeboat but not an arrow to my heart,btohqsg

Me to every single subject ever,btohqsg
North Korea tiktok on my fyp now hahahahahahahahahaha,btohqsg
STUPID POLL but its smth that has been brewing on my mind for a while now,btohqsg
Wondering what the consensus is amongst teens n young adults yknow,btohqsg
Everyone vote no and 0 pls,btohqsg
Thats just validating your own opinions lol,btohqsg
This is for guys n gals,btohqsg
But itll be interesting to make separate polls for guys n gals... maybe,btohqsg
In the future u will definitely want to settle down for sure,btohqsg
LOL are the two 7+ kids just trolling 😂,btohqsg
They trying to boost the low birth rates,btohqsg
Im surprised there are 2 out of 7 responses that say 7+,btohqsg
I think in sg its very possible to raise 7 kids. Nothing fancy and very simple living but really.. sg has every single thing catered for education and raising young kids,btohqsg
So if 2 ppl really want 7+ i can see why,btohqsg
This poll doesn't not reflect SG's birth rate,btohqsg
On a very small sample size,btohqsg
We can see that its left skewed,btohqsg
Can I don't get married and wants to have kids? 😂,btohqsg
You wither have mental dissonance you haven't solved yet  or you can possibly adopt when you turn 30 or smth i forgot the age for it,btohqsg
Being a single dad in sg is messed up. The government barely helps you,btohqsg
"Singapore is not the place to be if youre not part of the ""normal""",btohqsg
Is that thai lol whats it mean,btohqsg
Why cant you be binomial instead  its so much easier to solve.....,btohqsg
So if no petrol can run on electric,btohqsg
Btw in geog right we learn this thing calledBiogeochemical reactions and biogeophysical morphology,btohqsg
Why are you discriminating against theological studies and project work 🥶,btohqsg
Lets add in a moral element then,btohqsg
And cohere to form a roadmap for the future upcoming next up innovative experimental inventive plan,btohqsg
Bumping the polls again bc we be spamming up the chat,btohqsg
It's alr fking expensive for one,btohqsg
8 for huat  10 for soccer,btohqsg
How exactly are these kids gonna survive in a middle income household,btohqsg
Imagine how tiresome their home’s gonna be,btohqsg
No room to study alone and all that,btohqsg
What do u factor in to make it expensive 😂,btohqsg
Tuition is a luxury  but many people seem to forget that,btohqsg
Good question. There is a CNA documentary on a 7? Child household on youtube,btohqsg
Its a simple life for the family and kids but they make it work,btohqsg
Will it be the best for everyone involved according to their feelings about it and what society deems to be markers of success?No,btohqsg
Btw could i ask the 7+ kids people (26% out of 19 respondents)  are yall trolling or do you really have that goal?Will it be in singapore or a different country?What lifestyle and job will you be aiming for to support the family?,btohqsg
"Looks like you're more of a ""quantity over quality"" person",btohqsg
More of a different kind of quality,btohqsg
Personally i try to align myself more towards simple and decent living and a a lot of savings,btohqsg
Though i understand why some people choose otherwise. It feels good i suppose,btohqsg
You may say that now but it is more necessary than you think,btohqsg
Wait until it's your own children's turn to enter the education system,btohqsg
its not if it is cheap,btohqsg
Demand for tuition is income elastic,btohqsg
They wont be getting tuition unless theyre really bad or if they are very driven for a certain goal,btohqsg
Anyway im not staying here LOL,btohqsg
I doubt europe has such intense tuition regardless,btohqsg
So i probably wont be able to find it as easily and for such prices,btohqsg
or they dont study as hard,btohqsg
Asians are abnormal in terms of study ethic,btohqsg
thats why tuition in europe is not so rife,btohqsg
so all 2480 ppl here are abnormal,btohqsg
Normal to singapore  abnormal to the world,btohqsg
Lemme send u a funny article,btohqsg
Thats shows how abnormal things are becoming,btohqsg
School District Decides Asians Aren't Students of Colorhttps://reason.com/2020/11/16/equity-report-north-thurston-asian-students-of-color/,btohqsg
Im surprised there are no 1 child family dreamers hahah,btohqsg
Hmm I think maclaurin had brother. His name is Taylor,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionin your experience around how much is A for h2 fm,btohqsg
I don’t think it’s a very good use of time to think about such things,btohqsg
So I don’t count my marks and I don’t try to figure out what the cut off mark for A is any year,btohqsg
It’s not a productive line of thought,btohqsg
John  what makes you so wise,btohqsg
Not thinking about exams after they’re over,btohqsg
You dont feel any anxiety/dread after the paper finish?,btohqsg
Or like few days before collecting results,btohqsg
No. Why should you? What's done is done,btohqsg
Congrats BCME/BCMH/BCML/BCMMusic (and other combis) kids,btohqsg
I always overthink or become anxious,btohqsg
Like just last year for o lvls i had a dream or two about my results,btohqsg
Scoring decent as well as badly,btohqsg
Sadly i think knowing a rough cut off is helpful,btohqsg
I would  but i think about it  and rationally I know there’s nothing to be done any more  so I just let it go,btohqsg
I just ignore it all the way until results day,btohqsg
It is irrational to worry  so I do the rational thing,btohqsg
I alr know how I did right after the paper  fail 😂,btohqsg
but its irrationally rational not to worry too,btohqsg
It is rational not to worry  yes,btohqsg
Pros of worrying: ??Cons of worrying: you spend precious holiday time stressing out,btohqsg
Apply Econs in real life  and be a rational actor,btohqsg
I checked nearly every single answer after every paper,btohqsg
Relief Regret Relief for the rest of the day  then move on  few days before results if worry  do research on backup plans (if you haven’t alr),btohqsg
Get a more reputable news article,btohqsg
There are other articles that say the same thing if you search the headline,btohqsg
It is simply documentation of an event,btohqsg
Raising 7 kid is not easy,btohqsg
Study first and don't think about kids,btohqsg
Mhmm  I'm sure at his age it would be impossible,btohqsg
No. I am thinking of kids greatly. Why study or work and only then think you can fit kids into your life?,btohqsg
Unless you mark suck a bird,btohqsg
If not go ahead with your mindset,btohqsg
Also no work you don't even think of getting children,btohqsg
I know. Thats why i said Work for your future children  house  and lifestyle,btohqsg
You work now to pursue an endgoal. Do not work for the sake of working,btohqsg
Work and study is equally important i suggest you put that as priority,btohqsg
It is not a question of priorities. It is a question of purpose,btohqsg
Why should i work? Why should i study?Because i want something to come out of it in the future,btohqsg
When you dh a purpose how is there a priority?,btohqsg
Get a stable income before you even think of having kids,btohqsg
"Exactly. Thus i don't understand why my youth should lead me to ""Study first and don't think about kids""",btohqsg
Yeah that's why he is saying the purpose is to have kids,btohqsg
Ahhh okay i mustve misunderstood. Are you saying dont think about having themnow?,btohqsg
Purpose: Big familyMechanism to get there: Job and studies,btohqsg
You can always think next time,btohqsg
Thats flawed thinking in my opinion,btohqsg
"Are you going to slot children into your life when you feel the ""time is right""?",btohqsg
Before you even think of having kids,btohqsg
Then you will work and work and study till you die. When is it appropriate to start thinking?,btohqsg
This kind of logic extends that way,btohqsg
Ah  then i think what you mean to say is to achieve financial security first,btohqsg
So the aim is financial security,btohqsg
When i am about 20 plus years old,btohqsg
You'll figure it out as you get older,btohqsg
You need some sort of dream to motivate you,btohqsg
No matter how small or crazy,btohqsg
I alrd have a goal in life,btohqsg
Awesome! Then chase that goal with intensity,btohqsg
Also remember that timelines dont matter kekw u can fulfil your goal at 40 or 25 it really doesn't matter 😂,btohqsg
Yeet okay back to geog. Spent enough time chitchatting for this break,btohqsg
Well dang congrats. You’re more mature than 90% of 16 year olds,btohqsg
Because most 16 year olds have no idea what to do with their lives,btohqsg
Knowing what you want to do and yet smoking drinking gaming fapping etc... thats very immature 😂,btohqsg
B-but i have a goal 🥺,btohqsg
I’m 16... and I’ve been surrounded by them for years so Ye I daresay it is to a degree,btohqsg
I mean okaytechnically... goal-making and life goals are a tiny marker or maturity,btohqsg
However (pulls out geog knowledge)  to have an accurate indicator you need to make it as a composite index  in which it comprises of multiple factors and takes into account a wide range of variables,btohqsg
Anybody know what’s SMU game theory?,btohqsg
If you go to JC it is still possible to switch to therightpath,btohqsg
What if.. im interested in so many things,btohqsg
I used to be interested in like 10 fields... none linked,btohqsg
hiii. is it true that 4h2 is only for overseas scholarships?,btohqsg
why do I see h2 geog all over the chat,btohqsg
4H2 will look good to any scholarship,btohqsg
But of course rank point is always superior,btohqsg
im only looking at local uni so is 4h2 really necessary? im afraid that i might end up getting a B or even C for econs if i take it at h2 level,btohqsg
If u intend to apply scholarship at local uni  then 4H2 would be good  but not required,btohqsg
Rank point is always the no. 1 factor,btohqsg
For some faculties in NUS  90RP is a straight up merit scholarship,btohqsg

whats this convo abt 7 kids,btohqsg
People apply 4.0 all the time,btohqsg
Only if portfolio damn strong like intern at microsoft at 16 or shit,btohqsg
Actually I am kinda curious  can a 77 rp apply for scholarships?,btohqsg
If someone is 77rp I think they can try for bursary subject to their household financial situation,btohqsg
Because still need to look at the need based factor,btohqsg
I don’t think any scholarship is grades blind,btohqsg
Although study awards aren’t really scholarships,btohqsg
Depends on what u are keen in?,btohqsg
The only ones that are highly possible will prob be MOE/MOH Award and SAF award/study award,btohqsg
But high tier ones obviously don’t,btohqsg
Who wants to be a teacher when they grow up? 😂,btohqsg
No  i want to grow up but i want to do it slower,btohqsg

One has a lock  the other no lock,btohqsg
How do the other unis (apart from nus) fare against ntu in cs?,btohqsg
So far sutd has decent ges for their is right,btohqsg
i dont need to see no more benzenes,btohqsg
Hmm this is the one I used to lock my bunk cupboard during NS,btohqsg
Sutd's ges for infosys: Mean=4.448k median=4.3k 75th %tile=5k 25th %tile=4kNtu ges cs: mean=3.9 median=3.8 75%tile=4.5 25%tile=3.5,btohqsg
Although ntu business+cpu is better than ntu cs but it has 100% employment rate so im sus of its sample size,btohqsg
If money is what u have in mind,btohqsg
For me  its still either nus/ntu,btohqsg
Even work cant give much tbh,btohqsg
Wherever you go  don't go NTU for CS,btohqsg
Alright ill take that advice to heart haha,btohqsg
I heard it's the worst uni for CS,btohqsg
Can still play 🏀 in ntu?,btohqsg
Nus cs if u wanna learn more stuff and faster-paced curriculumNtu if u want a slower pace,btohqsg
Does anyone know about NUS infosystems and NUS biz analytics?? I see the pages talking about it like quite similar leh the results of students,btohqsg
Both their graduates can do financial stuff work in all fields blablabla,btohqsg
Sigh step curry is not hitting as many 3s as he used to,btohqsg
any poly y3 here got uni early apps email?,btohqsg

like i need time absorb first,btohqsg
comparing to my friends in other poly,btohqsg
i felt that science in other poly btr,btohqsg

thats what they will look at ah,btohqsg
I mean your gpa is not terrible now also,btohqsg
not the most terrible I've seen,btohqsg
maybe it's bad for sci course,btohqsg
at least for the ppl ik la,btohqsg
say got a lot of ppl 3.8 and above one,btohqsg
I think to get directors list is like 3.4 lol,btohqsg
the whole hbl thing in sem 1 screwed the y1s up,btohqsg
actl rp not that hard one,btohqsg
but to stare at computer for so long damn hard,btohqsg
den i thought can bank into msa ese,btohqsg
u don't have msa and ese?,btohqsg
they make dg harder to score,btohqsg
so its harder to get A,btohqsg
I cheat code and take from textbook one,btohqsg
i feel rp is good for other courses like sta shl soi,btohqsg
but sas like is either u damn zai can understand fast,btohqsg

I know of a student who did that,btohqsg
Aiyo then shld be more explicit ma,btohqsg
There are far more people taking H2 Fmaths than H2 French,btohqsg
Definitely. I believe only abt 20 students take H2 French in sg.,btohqsg
Then SEAB moderates the grades for 20 students?,btohqsg
Or is it just raw score for them,btohqsg
yale nus is more humanities inclined lo,btohqsg

Good idea but i dont think i will do that 😂 dont know many,btohqsg

Just email them and ask them for intern  don't need shy,btohqsg
Need to work on my cv tho. It looks very bland and template-style,btohqsg
Anyone has good cv/resumé tips? Or websites i can learn from,btohqsg
I kinda know what to put in but i struggle with the design and formatting. Not sure how to do it,btohqsg
anyone knows of any public places that I can study at with my friends  and also talk (Apart from starbucks  coffee places/fast food places)? Thanks,btohqsg
Tampines Hub - there’s tables scattered almost everywhere,btohqsg
ah apart from there? cos i stay in the West HAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Maybe to me   void deck is like your balcony .,btohqsg
Nothing. Its just what i walk through to get to where i need to go,btohqsg
nah I'm just asking cos I nvr really hang out at the void deck but I see other ppl doing so,btohqsg
Place for YP to zhut zhut with XMM,btohqsg
places to zhut zhut and piak piak,btohqsg
NUS FASS folks (regardless of major)  what was your experience like,btohqsg
If I'm at any void deck it's so that I can pet those fur children,btohqsg
Tbh it’s very diff to answer like that because experiences in diff majors are vastly diff,btohqsg
Haha I mean I know that diff major will have diff experience  but because the major I want is like really niche  so I guess the next best bet is to hear from everyone else😅,btohqsg
Is it the env one? Haha,btohqsg
It's a major within ELL dept,btohqsg
Oh that HAHA the one that’s so niche ppl forget abt,btohqsg
Folks seem to have fun with it,btohqsg
what are the most niche majors across all the 6 autonomous unis  just curious,btohqsg
I define that as majors that are so small and unheard of that a student might not even remember that it exists,btohqsg
"science majors seem to be really represented no matter how ""obscure"" it is",btohqsg
i think envt science is more well known than computational biology,btohqsg
there are niche science stuff too?,btohqsg
in jc no one knew what computational bio was  but environment science more ppl knew abt it,btohqsg
thats true haha  I've heard of computational bio in passing but never really went to find out about it,btohqsg
NTU ADM and NUS DID are rather niche places also imo  it's definitely not the typical STEM/liberal arts deal,btohqsg
but ntu adm known for one the lowest rp?,btohqsg
same for that  one of the lowest rp?,btohqsg
Social work is a major  today I learned,btohqsg
there's suss social work bsc also,btohqsg
ah I've heard of the SUSS one,btohqsg
I'm just surprised that there's one in FASS too cos FASS has always emphasised on offering only non-professional majors if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
This one low rp but need portfolio and all that  so it's probably 100% ABAS,btohqsg
adm offers a BFA so the non-academic admission component is compulsory,btohqsg
might try for that if my rp cmi for FASS,btohqsg
As a current FASS student  never heard such thing,btohqsg
I believe Dr Robin Loon was the one who said it in his TS FAQ on youtube back in July or August,btohqsg
I had to google this person so this person doesn't have the authority to speak for FASS HAHA it's his opinion,btohqsg
"i guess its worth clarifying what you mean by ""non-professional"" also?",btohqsg
haha basically general degree  non conservatory and not like doctor/lawyer/engineer,btohqsg
I think 90% of uni courses are also general degrees so,btohqsg
I see engineering as a general degree also,btohqsg
"there's a specific language around ""professional degree"" btw. medicine  law  engineering  accountancy  can be considered ""professional degrees"" cus actually beyond the degree  there is a component of additional professional certifications.",btohqsg
so that might be what he meant. Social work is traditionally not a professional degree  but the industry is increasingly creating more professional certifications around it.,btohqsg
Is definitely not as specialised as certain majors,btohqsg
"at a more layman level  many majors have relatively structured and mainstream career options (even if not considered ""professional degrees""). in FASS  this may include Comms&NewMedia leading to advertising  PR  or design type work.",btohqsg
then there's majors that don't have clear obvious career outcomes  like History. the most direct and clearcut career option for that would be to go into academia  research  etc. But these much more general degrees usually build broad perspectives and critical thinking  more than tangible hard skills.,btohqsg
it was not in response to you  it was an attachment to illustrate your comment on engineering degrees HAHA,btohqsg
What do u think about the common line of thought that having such degrees won't help you get a job?,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfrpoc74UwYDid a panel discussion previously (kinda long) that talked about this. Essentially  the responsibility of your employability lies in your hands at the end of the day. Some degrees directly prep you for certain jobs because its influenced by workforce needs and Manpower Ministry  Trade/Industry Ministry.More general degrees also exist because people are people and should be allowed to pursue their interests.1. These general degrees are great at broadening horizons and perspectives. This is useful at higher levels of leadership and management  but you tend to struggle at early stage of career without clear hard skills.2. To better support yourself  be more involved in initiatives and projects outside of school  and build up some form of entry-level job skills. whether its writing  marketing  design  project management.,btohqsg
"HAHA I'd tell those ppl  especially those that are speaking from exp  you just didn't know how to pivot your course properly to get a job. Based on what I observe from my seniors  those that got a job effortlessly despite having such ""general degrees"" they don't take modules just to fulfil grad criteria/for CAP. Aside from compulsory mods  the mods they choose  they have specific personal outcomes they wanna achieve from the mod.",btohqsg

General degrees in my opinion are good for people who already know what they want to do and how they can get there,btohqsg
