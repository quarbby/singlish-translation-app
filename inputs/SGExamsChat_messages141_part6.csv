dont like it when they impose their lives on me,btohqsg
plus i think i moving abroad in 3 years or so,btohqsg
No need. But very good to have one. Is like expeditation to go higher up,btohqsg
To where? I may be familar with this,btohqsg
They r just setting the bar high to push ur boundary,btohqsg
haha to a non-english speaking place,btohqsg
Cos ure still young and can still afford working towards it while u dun have many commitments now,btohqsg
But degree is a good backupLike covid strike and so many biz have to wind down. Then wheres the alternative plans?,btohqsg
Yes lah can get later lahz,btohqsg
but i dont think its for me  not now,btohqsg
Then stop talking to them. They bull üòÇ,btohqsg
Then get later. Go work first,btohqsg
If u work first and wait till 40  suss can give u grant üòÇ sch fees will only be 10k by then,btohqsg
Suss can apply for scholarship/sponsorship too. U just pay for first sem  do well  then go n apply. Sponsorship not difficult to get but u must do some rapport building - a senior shared w me,btohqsg
Forget it dun argue. Our parents are always woodblock cos generational gap. It is natural for them to be less intelligent than newer generation. Just find ur way,btohqsg
Usually you need to set up a business and register it  and then qualify for some investor or working (self-employed by registered company) or business visa or residence permit to live there. As long as your business is registered should not be a big issue.Make sure you have all the paperwork in order for your business. Many people hire agents to sort out the paperwork. In some developing countries (not saying you will go there) the bureaucracy can be terrible. In some cases there is corruption.,btohqsg
No lah. Wont. Employers just want assurance that u know what u want and that u wont ‰∏âÂàÜÈíüÁÉ≠Â∫¶. Cos employers r always looking for ppl who will STAY and GROW with them,btohqsg
@espressobitchyes cos it shows u hv gone thru that experience.,btohqsg
Dunntalk to ppl la. Noisy world  they also dunno ur path. Nobody can give u best advice.,btohqsg
So long as u set ur goals just go and achieve it no need to consult ppl.,btohqsg
ironically ur giving good advice lol,btohqsg
Ya thats why dun talk about it to ppl. Thats usually what u will get when u share ur goals with ppl. Is normal.,btohqsg
Where u wanna do ur finance/econs??,btohqsg
HAHAHAH i was half trolling   there r better options than suss,btohqsg
Thkq cos i was u too.. gone thru exact same situation n feel,btohqsg
oh yea totally forget about ut,btohqsg
