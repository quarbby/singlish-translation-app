My thought are ... Singapore still got many rich people,btohqsg
I guess the only way price went it is when supply is getting lower and lower. Aging population would also meant there is more demand for car. I personally bought my car as part of the plan to allow easier travel for my aging mum who have difficulties in walking distances like 400m.And we are still debating on free transportation at the parliament for senior citizens and the physically challenged group of folks.,btohqsg
Iswaran’s points on increased costs if we provide free for disabled and seniors are quite valid. 300-400m is not small change. But I’m sure we can come to a middle ground  like free only for certain hours  this might work and wouldn’t burden the commuters too much as well.Those who can pay more should pay more to help the less privileged. At least in my opinion.,btohqsg

I doubt it is that high to be honest. It was proposed that the free rides for disabled and seniors are during off peaks hours. These are the times where the buses and train would have some free capacity. Even if there is increase in cost  it shouldn't be that much since the buses and trains are plying the route already.,btohqsg
That’s only aft Iswaran countered with the actual cost if it’s implemented for full day,btohqsg
Not practical for full day implementation now. As we walk out of Covid  the trains and peak bus routes gonna be packed anyways. You can't really be expecting elderly to squeeze thru the hoards of Human crowd. Even PIW will find themselves difficulties in navigating around.So I am still focusing in the idea for free transport for elderly and PIW during off peak hours. Pretty much the same idea where we gave discount COE for red plate cars. But now with the current COE prices  red plate provide much incentive to adopt....,btohqsg
I not saying that I don’t support the idea of free transport during off peak hours  provided we can find the funding from some source. Either pass this cost to consumers  or don’t implement.On that topic of OPC  I also feel this system is obsolete   and should be improved. A pay per use system can be considered.,btohqsg
Feels like we're crawling out of covid. Not walking 🤣,btohqsg
I just read old weekend cars used to have their own seperated COE system. The old COE was CAT 1 TO CAT 8 🐈,btohqsg

$2.00/litre is the Max we should be paying for petrol. If our neighbouring country can subsidise and not tax their citizens. It is possible it can be managed here too. Its just Greed plain and simple profiteering,btohqsg
EV takes a long time to charge if you are out of your home based charger. Also if you are low on charge you really need to search for a charger nearby and if its occupied  you would have to wait a long time for the owner to drive away. If you're in Malaysia its as good as not finding one as its not easily available everywhere.,btohqsg
I drove for 3 month   10% to 80 % is only 20 minute   but I am using home charger most of the time   actually got ppl going Malaysia already with ev   but to me ev is perfect in Singapore due to lot of city driving and save alot of petrol and no maintenance and lastly good price for cat a coe,btohqsg
That's Good. For me I need a little bit more convincing and of course a fast charger  easily available everywhere before  even considering switching over. Ha. Ha..😜,btohqsg
Yeah just sharing   as ev for me is too good in terms of   pricing   performance   cost   convenience  it been 3 month I visit a petrol kiosk or need to go charge   and no maintenance like engine oil and such,btohqsg
I am now renting a diesel van but the big companies are selling like 2.89,btohqsg
It is like buying petrol at old times. And i just started on this delivery thing  just quit my full time not long ago,btohqsg
Let's just 🙏 n hope that the war doesn't drag out then,btohqsg
hey was reading about road tax in sg  could anyone help to explain why its higher for EVS? im not too aware bout this,btohqsg
Is due to the additional tax due to petrol saving,btohqsg
