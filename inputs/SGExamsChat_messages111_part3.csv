Single source shortest path is v specific. Like 1 source to 1 vertex at a time.Eg A to B takes 5A to C takes 10A to D takes ..... like that 1 by 1,btohqsg
Ur source vertex is A here,btohqsg
Oh not from a to b to c to d  liddat har,btohqsg
I no need start from A again,btohqsg
I want start from A and span everywhere,btohqsg
Minimum spanning tree is like u start from A,btohqsg
Using minimum total possible edge weight,btohqsg
You go read up prim algorithm,btohqsg
These are the 2 to find minimum soanning tree,btohqsg
But my edge is unidirectional sia,btohqsg
Minimum spanning tree is for connected undirected weighted edge graph,btohqsg
Once u visit a vertex  u box it up,btohqsg
Eh but I can visit the vertex multiple times sia,btohqsg
Choose the minimum possible weighted edge each time,btohqsg
No requirement to stop only once per vertex,btohqsg
Cos no direct path for certain pairs of vertex,btohqsg
You see whats the smallest edge,btohqsg
From A to any vertex not boxed up yet,btohqsg
If for eg A to C has the smallest edge,btohqsg
So A and C are now visited,btohqsg
Repeat this until all vertex visited,btohqsg
Then there's no direct edge between c and b,btohqsg
I want go b from c,btohqsg
Ur problem just wants u to visit all vertex right,btohqsg
As long as it passes the vertex once is ok?,btohqsg
As long as ur graph is connected  minimum spanning tree will work,btohqsg
Fuck 18 vertex my friend want to draw it out,btohqsg
If not connected ur problem is meaningless lol,btohqsg
Cause it is impossible to visit all if unconnected,btohqsg
you can get from ANY vertex to ANY OTHER vertex via a series of edges,btohqsg
I think confirm is connected if. Not can't even do,btohqsg
Hand draw can find solutions bo,btohqsg
True  just as an admin i would like to caution against giving away personal info to new members,btohqsg
Diff and integration are kinda fun ngl ðŸ˜³ when i revise them and have the rules on hand ateast,btohqsg
Well tbh H1 econs tests on 3 macro aims instead of 4.,btohqsg
Ok I give up le. MST finds the edges only,btohqsg
Never count how many times I need to pass through the edges,btohqsg
My brain kenot comprehend this shit,btohqsg
I remember alr. It tastes like abolone!!,btohqsg
the rain seem to have stopped@medbag,btohqsg
It felt so good when its raining,btohqsg
what is peace when you've exams in 10 days,btohqsg
For some reason it made everything felt..,btohqsg
Everybody knows it sucks to grow up,btohqsg
I shall evolve into a fetus,btohqsg
The years go on and we're still fighting :),btohqsg
Being asian with parents that have high expectations of you,btohqsg
Atleast im almost done being a student.,btohqsg
luckily my parents aren't typical asians,btohqsg
they don't really have any expectations,btohqsg
