how does gpa work / how is it calculated,btohqsg
sometimes the tests in rp are rigged,btohqsg
i have no idea we use rank points and AAA/A score here,btohqsg
im asking how gpa is calculated in polys,btohqsg
isnt this o levels as well,btohqsg
but ik all a's 4.0 all b's 3.0  all c's 2.0,btohqsg
yea 60+ ppl kenna for my batch,btohqsg
half of them copy the same exact codes w/ same errors,btohqsg
i wan try cheat in ite,btohqsg
glad i didnt go to poly now,btohqsg
you guys are making it sound like polys are disastrous,btohqsg
HAHAHA but poly is so much easier than jc tbh,btohqsg
you have to be consistent in poly,btohqsg
last minute studying students are gone,btohqsg
"if you have periods of ""i dont like studying"" and periods of "" im going to put my 100%""...then going to poly is a curse",btohqsg
i cant even by chicken rice,btohqsg
used to be can buy chicken rice,btohqsg
yeah but a level content is ginormous,btohqsg
for other poly's not mine..faci's have told my classs b4 that majority of the 3 month long graded assignments can be done in 1 week,btohqsg
our first topic notes are already thick as hell,btohqsg
anyone know how to make fake ic to sneak into clubs,btohqsg
everything  except for chinese pw and gp,btohqsg
I forgot what's stem again help,btohqsg
Ah yes probably I'll enjoy it,btohqsg
then what about poly to uni,btohqsg
I heard they can skip first year,btohqsg
Unfortunately there's no epi pen for that allergic rxn,btohqsg
so poly students still go for the full 3 years?,btohqsg
is it 3 years for bach deg in sg unis,btohqsg
then go poly got no difference,btohqsg
i also went jc because i hearsay that poly is expensive...,btohqsg
dont want to waste my parents precious money,btohqsg
U can't rly get first foot into a job,btohqsg
With just a A lvl cert,btohqsg
U most likely need to go uni first,btohqsg
That's the main thing abt JC la,btohqsg
a level cert is just a paper for uni apps,btohqsg
Yes is cheaper in the short term,btohqsg
btw one of the comments i had for my A..the bellcurve i was referring to in rp,btohqsg
but the whole point of students going to jc is because their final destination is uni,btohqsg
if i failed the quiz..i was likely to have gotten B,btohqsg
I remb that time you got 7 marks or smth and got a B,btohqsg
im getting a S or a E if i got that for my weighted assessments,btohqsg
and i would defo cry and sob all day long if i got 7/20,btohqsg
that sounds like a pathetic score,btohqsg
"actually ""less people fail  nothing changes""",btohqsg
Ya it's damn normal in jc,btohqsg
"this 13.5/20 is exactly what i meant when i say rp dont reward hardwork..spending maybe 1-2 extra hrs a day to get that 16> also would have yielded the same grade of a ""A""",btohqsg
Big problem for poly context isit,btohqsg
i mean u get B but u got 7/20 ????,btohqsg
