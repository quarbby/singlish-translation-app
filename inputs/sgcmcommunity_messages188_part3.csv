Anyone installed the OBU already? Should I opt out the touch screen display?,btohqsg
No display very troublesome to check the amount,btohqsg
Can check from apps right? Wondering if the display will block driver view,btohqsg
Possible to ask them just plug in the display but don't stick the display anywhere? Then we can decide where to put it ourselves?,btohqsg
If you opt out they will still give you I think,btohqsg
But it's stupid  should make it an opt in instead of opt out  can save so much costs,btohqsg
Yah lah I rather just take the diaSplay on the spot ask them how to plug in and look at connectors. Maybe in future get appropriate extension cable and then mount display wherever I want eg. In the coin box I open and see display. Close coin box display is hidden etc.,btohqsg
Wonder if can pass inspection if we move the display tho,btohqsg
Doesn't matter where you put it since even if don't have also legal,btohqsg

This erp 2.0 is actually a tech system designed 10 years ago,btohqsg
So I think it’s obsolete by todays tech standard?,btohqsg
Hopefully they don't drill hole and mount into ur dashboard plastic. I doubt they will just rely on 3m tape. Some car leather some plastic then the surface all different. Some soft touch.,btohqsg
