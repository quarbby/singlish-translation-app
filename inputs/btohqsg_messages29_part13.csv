Hello if there are two projects in a region but only one project is within 4km of parents do we qualify for MCPS for both projects when we apply in that region? Since there's no way to subselect a project,btohqsg
Hi. How do we calculate when we will receive our keys? 37 months from now?,btohqsg

Hover ur mouse over the ? There will be ecd and dpd dates,btohqsg
"This box will appear when hover mouse over the ""?"".. Just that unsure if key collection ie from ecd dates and dpd is worse case date...",btohqsg
How do we check the statistics of this unit for past application,btohqsg
If ur number is within the available units  no u cant.,btohqsg
Bto needs to wait 4 to 5 years  this one is now  already got key,btohqsg
That‚Äôs if you actually get a number,btohqsg
Jeff u are right üëâ  how to check past statistics applications,btohqsg
45 years  will many ppl want it BTW?,btohqsg
Jeff I really need help  how to interpret the numbersI am senior above 70  Divorced  single applicant n only bought resale once,btohqsg
I not sure if you being a previous owner once affects it  but you should be counted under seniors? You can call HDB first thing tomorrow morning to ask if got any questions,btohqsg
Senior 70 yrs old divorced single never bought new flat only resale is which column?,btohqsg
"how guarantee you can get Q number for SBF?if you choose to forfeit your Oct BTO since you have Q num within supply  highly likely you no longer a second timer and you need to appeal for another flat in the future. and... what if you don't get SBF Q number... you will def feel sian.pls consider carefully. HDB allows each citizen to be ""owners"" twice. third time onwards you may need to go private.",btohqsg
How to check community care apartment prices?,btohqsg
NotedNow already 70 years old  now rentingSBF the one I apply is 6 to 1 chance,btohqsg
Not applicable. Like can't apply for 2nd timers for example,btohqsg
For context  2nd timers can't apply for sbf units where there are only 20 or lesser units available.Where the flat supply is less than 20 units and it is unable to meet the demand from first-timer families  only first-timer families will be shortlisted within 100% of the flat supply.,btohqsg
what do you mean by 6 to 1 chance?is your Oct BTO 2024 Q number within supply? if yes  pls don't cancel. it will be difficult for you since you consider second timer and that you mentioned you bought resale before.,btohqsg
U can't even apply in the system if you have a Q number within the last project u applying or u already have a date for 1st appointment.Even you now never get appointment u go applyAnd u get a Date of appointment after before the results out and u never attend  your Feb 2025 also will automatically get cancelled,btohqsg
Hi can I ask  if application rate of first time applicants is 0.8 and second time applicants is 20 Does it mean that every 10 unit  8 first timer applying.And for second timer  every 10 unit  23 second timer applying?,btohqsg
Every 1 unit  got 20 second timer applying.,btohqsg
Can i just ask if we apply for SBF   in an area we cant apply for another area?,btohqsg
Does this means higher chances for frist timer families?,btohqsg
What is the probability of first timer 3 roomflat in clem,btohqsg
Nearly 100% if the applications closed today 4pm. Maybe a few families don't get because of rounding error.But that's assuming the ethnic quota is not an issue.But if more people apply from today till tmr  it's not 100% already.,btohqsg
Thanks darren really new to applying your explanation helps :),btohqsg
If I apply and I cancel before ballot result is out  do I lost my chance as first timer single?,btohqsg
Then why not just cancel now?,btohqsg
It's only going to be like 2 months,btohqsg
If we select a unit that is already available but prefer to collect the keys next year  would that be possible? Would we need to pay HDB to hold the keys for us?,btohqsg
Why ah? Cause you don‚Äôt wanna ROM first ah?,btohqsg
But first thing first how sure are you that you'll be able to get ballot number within supply sis?If you get  then you'll need to speak the officer in charge when you go for selection.,btohqsg
i am asking about the likelihood of this happening..,btohqsg
If you get la. Then on the day of selection you speak the officer about it.,btohqsg
The longer they hold  the more interest fee will incur.,btohqsg
I reckon you may appeal to get it waive for the first few months only. Subsequently  there will be fee incur.As mentioned  ask the officer in charge when you go for selection.,btohqsg
You email HDB for this la  they will probably ask for reason and all,btohqsg
Not substantial I don't think they will entertain,btohqsg
SBF is for people who need it urgently  not for people to anyhow chope dunno when ROM.. want to chope then BTO la,btohqsg
sorry  where can i see this?,btohqsg
I've a resale flat under my name bought when i was single. Now i apply for sbf with my wife. Am i considered a first timer? How many chances will i get?,btohqsg
First timer if your wife is a first timer  2 chances,btohqsg
Anyone knw if HDB line service is down?,btohqsg
