They are like mercenaries for politics,btohqsg
We support you but u give us all u got,btohqsg
I thought that had to do more with Brexit? Not rly the lib dem deal,btohqsg
Unless I’m missing out on something,btohqsg
They did lmao which is why it's funny,btohqsg
Mf was chipping away at their own foundations,btohqsg
imagine if the snp collapses in the GE,btohqsg
Tbh at this point I still don’t know what the policy positions of the lib dems are. They’re like “vote for us because we’re not tories” so ok but what can they offer if they beat the tories,btohqsg
If I were a UK voter though I’d vote tactically and choose the candidate which has the highest chance of beating the tories,btohqsg
They alr pissed off with Brexit,btohqsg
humza yousaf GONE!rishi sunk SOON TO BE GONE!kier starmer THE NEXT PM!,btohqsg
Anyway  we just have 2+ more days until the results of the UK local elections are out,btohqsg
I want to see how large a margin Sadiq Khan wins over his Tory opponent,btohqsg
im still here waiting for  the reppublican primaries,btohqsg
For the senate or the house?,btohqsg
anyws  drop ur SG cabinet reshuffle predictions,btohqsg
I really think Utah might flip ngl,btohqsg
are u out of ur mind??,btohqsg
Utah is different bruh like especially after Roe V Wade,btohqsg
I hope Lauren Boebert loses. But unfortunately in Colorado’s 4th district  Ken Buck’s replacement for the special election said that he does not intend to run in the general election,btohqsg
Isn’t Utah not a swing state,btohqsg
It normally isn't but then again Georgia was also not a swing state until 2020,btohqsg
But a straw poll showed that Lauren isn’t close to being first in the primary so hopefully that materialises,btohqsg
Oh well I guess I have to look at the polls,btohqsg
For the presidential election though  I hope RFK would do decently even if he doesn’t win,btohqsg
The Americans need to know that 3rd party candidates can win and voting for them is not a vote wasted,btohqsg
I have no idea for Arizona,btohqsg
But until the electoral college is abolished and replaced with a 2 round voting system  it would be hard to break up the duopoly,btohqsg
It's like a wild card for that,btohqsg
At this point it looks like it’s going to be Lake vs Gallego,btohqsg
It's gonna be a 2 horse Biden V Trump most likely,btohqsg
If momentum for RFK fades it’s quite likely,btohqsg
RFK would take votes away from both candidates but it remains to be seen how much from each of them,btohqsg
Some thinks he would eat into more of Biden’s votes than Trump’s  some think otherwise,btohqsg
I miss the Liz truss memes,btohqsg
Liz truss sounded more intelligent when she was with the lib dems tho lol,btohqsg
It's the electoral college so even if it does the end of the day I will benefit the Dems or Rep,btohqsg
Even without the electoral college won’t it still benefit one candidate over another as long as the 3rd party candidate steals more from the either of them,btohqsg
Actually do you want to join jj’s politics chat group,btohqsg
If you go we can go in together lol,btohqsg
as long as yall are SG based idm,btohqsg
we have sec  jc  ns and uni kids,btohqsg
In theory yes but due to the spoiler effect most of the time it's just R or D,btohqsg
Are they all extremely knowledgeable about politics or some of them have a rudimentary understanding,btohqsg
Is it cos the spoiler may take away more votes in some particular swing states,btohqsg
But I’ll leave it up to E120,btohqsg
I also not sure if I should join in myself,btohqsg
decent understanding  we all have one that we focus on more,btohqsg
Not rlly the swings don't matter. It's more of the fact their policies are gonna be stealing votes for either Rep or Dem,btohqsg
U can look at the 1912 election,btohqsg
