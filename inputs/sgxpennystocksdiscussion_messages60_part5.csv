dbs so far i thk nv really restrict anything,btohqsg
I use ocbc. Got broker to WhatsApp and call if need. Some time back  I hit my buy limit when try to put orders. He somehow got notified and texted me back to give him few minutes to up my limits.I also have uob and POEMS. Don't like uob user interface  prefer ocbc UI. I like POEMS market depth.,btohqsg
but it depends bah  i only got uob and dbs.. honestly dbs dont have a broker to WA or call and the call center really haisz.. but uob and ocbc got someone to assist you so depends on individual bah,btohqsg
I thought all should have a broker de?,btohqsg
hmm mine dont have :( dbs v,btohqsg
There should be  just that he never contact you only...,btohqsg
Then when i got uob  the broker damn on,btohqsg
Long time ago  I used to use DBS. There was a broker assigned to me. Last time no WA  but he will call me over the phone. After that my friend joined UOB  so I changed to UOB and didn't use my DBS anymore...,btohqsg
