Hi bros/sis  there is a  series of cashcard theft cases in my MSCP. Apparently the culprit is able to open and later lock doors. Any idea how this is done? And what type of cars are at risk?,btohqsg
Sounds like someone got hold of a master key for a specific model,btohqsg
Got but culprit was wearing mask,btohqsg
stealing cashcards is the scummiest thing i've heard so far,btohqsg
I‚Äôm quite worried about this. Looks like the culprit is able to open doors and lock back,btohqsg
possible  but there are many ways to gain access to the cars tbh,btohqsg
The guy seems quite efficient based on the video posted by victim,btohqsg
i've heard some clone keys  but some use this tiny device that can mimick a signal,btohqsg
Sounds like door open / door close,btohqsg
think the device is called a flipper,btohqsg
Are certain makes / models at risk?,btohqsg
i've heard FCA cars and Hyundai/Kias are hot property in USA,btohqsg
or Stellantis as they're called now,btohqsg
Thanks bro for the info. According to victims  the cars that kana so far include Mazda and suzuki,btohqsg
Probably got more but the owners not active in the chat,btohqsg
Even if the signal is mimicked.. It should be a running key so old key captured at that point of time shouldn't work,btohqsg
As far as it known. Not really.. unless it is something rather new. Even capturing signals is not the best way to do it anymore cause of the running key. so it might be something new or simply.. maybe they really never lock üëÄ,btohqsg
Youtube does have quite a fair bit of video on Mazdas... no key or electronics.. just a coat hanger,btohqsg
That leads to my suspicion that he didn‚Äôt physically break in  likely use some from of remote unlock,btohqsg
Don't blame Honda for making him fast,btohqsg
