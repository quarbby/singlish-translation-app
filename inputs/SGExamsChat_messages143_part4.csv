wasn't the case last year either,btohqsg
night study at most ended at 8,btohqsg
but you had to be extraordinarily underperforming,btohqsg
Hi can I check anyone can help with ib history;-;?,btohqsg
Oh  they have probably changed the system. That's good.,btohqsg
Singapore taught me that things other than studying is important. Have a work-life balance. Study effectively  not a lot but ineffectively.,btohqsg
Well  Sengkang used to be much smaller. Sengkang keeps expanding...They took over Seletar East Farmway in the early 2000s and now they want the West Farmway as well... Dug up part of Jalan Kayu...,btohqsg
Nice thanks for the history hahah,btohqsg
Butbut I nid like old history not within singapore,btohqsg
Anyone can help w CMC owon,btohqsg
It used to be so quiet... Until the roads mostly changed to something unrecognisable.,btohqsg
Construction equipment just came in and bulldozed so much,btohqsg
The four digit postal codes used until 1995,btohqsg
Jalan Kayu and the current 'Sengkang West',btohqsg
i take buses to TPE  den 168 all the way to bedok,btohqsg
Isn't there 969(highway)? It is 4 stops to tampines then you can trnfr to ew line to Bedok haha.,btohqsg
too lazy to take the mrt ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
"The stop is called ""after punggol rd""",btohqsg
They don't sell these books anymore,btohqsg
If they published a newer version I would have used it,btohqsg
maybe the boldened TPE is the stop,btohqsg
This just says express on TPE,btohqsg
but the trip takes 1 hr anyway  so might as well take 87 from the beginning HAHA,btohqsg
i was in 5na last year,btohqsg
actually on second thought this mildly makes sensecan take 38 from there straight to front gate,btohqsg
Is it normal for like mcq to have  consecutive 6 same letter? ;-; damn paranoid cuz of it,btohqsg
Yes  economics is actually a social science,btohqsg
If it is in the school internal exams  possible. Some schools seem to enjoy doing stuff like that,btohqsg
Maybe not 6 but quite a number,btohqsg
Then u go study it have a lot of math also,btohqsg
Letâ€™s be real geog and econs fake arts,btohqsg
It cant really be considered a social science if theres a truckload of math in uni econs,btohqsg
I know. I heard that in university it is a lot of applied mathematics and statistics. That's why I don't take economics. I strongly dislike statistics,btohqsg
I mean thatâ€™s why H1 math is a prerequisite,btohqsg
That's because in university that teach economics from scratch. And i understand a lot of A level economics is watered down and too obssessed with theoretical concepts  which university economics apparently isn't,btohqsg
Itâ€™s just arts coz of the exam,btohqsg
a level econs is only useful for the v first econs mod u do in uni,btohqsg
They dont even teach from scratch in NUS lol,btohqsg
Letâ€™s remove Econsâ€™ status as an arts subject so noob science kids canâ€™t get away with using a fake arts as a contrasting subject,btohqsg
1st sem alr have math calculus mods in econs alongisde a refresher a lvl econs mod,btohqsg
"The ""from scratch knoweldge for econs"" mod is negligible",btohqsg
Then geog should also be removed,btohqsg
So GELm kids are in fact science students,btohqsg
Isn't 'Refresher A levels economics' teaching from scratch  albeit quickly?,btohqsg
Is probably more of a skim through the syllabus,btohqsg
Because I suppose most of what is taught in A levels is not so relevant later?,btohqsg
Imagine learning h2 econs in 12 weeks,btohqsg
Do u think is any useful?,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not itâ€™s not relevant more of itâ€™s too basic bah,btohqsg
Essentially whatever econs knowledge u learnt in jc is false/pointless,btohqsg
