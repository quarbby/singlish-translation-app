🛏Pika World Bedtime Story🧸Reach for the stars is perhaps the last time investors hope for in the upcoming November inflation report. It is a tense moment. After all  Wall Street and Washington are worried about Nov’s figure pointing to the fastest annual rate for many decades.r🎙The ExpectationEconomists are generally looking for a 0.7% month over month increase in Consumer Price Index. As a result  the yearly rate increase is expected to be 6.7%  marking the fastest growth ever since the 1980s.💣Uncle Powell hands are TiedIf the figures come close to the expected level  then we are likely to see the Fed increase in the pace of scaling down the bond purchase.Hitting above expectation could send the market into turmoil as we are likely to see a faster rate increase  with some expecting in March. Although we had a more hawkish Uncle Powell recently  it provides investors with the time to adjust to the expectation of a tighter monetary situation.🗽President Biden Social SpendingHigher CPI reading is likely to complicate Biden’s trillion-dollar social spending plan. Sen Machin had been less inclined to vote for the bill partly due to the worry of inflation. Nonetheless  Senate Majority Leader Schumer had stated his desire to have the legislation complete before Christmas. So from now till then  the November inflation data is the only report of great significance.Economists generally do not expect the social spending plan to impact the inflation figure profoundly. This considers the more extended period of spending and the type of investment from the bill. Nonetheless  Machin is not willing to vote for a bill that continues to dash markets with streams of cash.🪜Challenges AheadEquity markets certainly prefer a milder figure. Despite some recovery of issues relating to supply chain constraints  Delta variant continues to complicate return to work momentum  more so with the uprising of Omicron  which could add fuel to inflation when consumers demand keeps coming at an elevated level.This volatile period poses challenging period to our portfolio returns and we remain conservative with tiny accumulation in each episode of pull back.Cheers Pika Nat,btohqsg
What a great week! Many more ahead!,btohqsg

Only quite recently  UnUsual Entertainment attempted the Crypto catalyst card. Brunei Prince Qawi (current Chairman) of HS Optimus/former KLW holdings coincidently is also an investor in UnUsual.Let’s see if they come out with some Crypto related news for HSO  if so hodlers all laugh to the bank 🏦.Looking at the recent FY21 Annual report of HS Optimus   it states ‘Exploring New Possibilities’ and depicts a pic of a door 🚪 opening to a ‘blockchain’ image.Signs? Time will tell. $0.004 risk free anyways.DYODD,btohqsg

📮Pika World in Focus🛎🍎Apple: Prospering in Uncertainty🍐Shares of Apple have been on the ride up as it has achieved more than 30% return year to date. In addition  it is marching towards a valuation of $3 trillion  unimaginable a year ago. Microsoft is the only company with a market cap over $2 trillion  with Alphabet  Amazon and Tesla each having a valuation above $1 trillion.✈️Safe Haven for Investors🪂It appears to be a flight to safety preferred stock by market participants. The pandemic had proven to have negligible impacts on its business model as consumers rushed to buy its Macs and iPads.As we move towards more normalcy in our life  we see the Apple services segment continuing to grow aggressively. Apple services business produces about $70 billion a year in revenue. Moreover  the innovation of Apple is rewarded by a deep sense of customer loyalty given its friendly shareholder policy of an aggressive shares buyback policy. So  logically  investors are inclined to love Apple.📱iPhone 13 Demand remains firm💰While there has been concern about its demand  most analysts report a robust iPhone 13 sales projection that exceeds supply. Part shortages are likely to eat into the December quarter result as the company faces pressure to meet demand. Yet  this has not impeded the rising share price momentum.🗽An Exciting Future⛳Wall Street is baking in more company growth with a possible two new categories of products: AR &VR headsets and autonomous vehicles. But  so far  it seems that potential upsides primarily drive price targets upward momentum based on iPhone sales and App Store activity rather than on the rumours of these latest products development.The future of Apple looks exciting. Any potential pullback will entice Pika World to accumulate more exposure to the company that continues to innovate incrementally and become a more wholesome component of our everyday lives.Thanks for reading this edition.
