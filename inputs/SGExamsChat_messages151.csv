I mean I can tell u personally,btohqsg
Lol. Ugh. God is just God whats there to discuss ? 😂,btohqsg
Ya then blending into its culture is part of it lo,btohqsg
Nothing is impossible sounds like a pop song,btohqsg
Is better to discuss current situation n perspective or solutions lol,btohqsg
More for pastors to share their life stories,btohqsg
Depending on how relevant or helpful,btohqsg
One of the pastor said he used to steal things from his friends and throw them away until he was caught idk,btohqsg
Most of it is about how God helped them or something,btohqsg
There is a key point there,btohqsg
Maybe he wants to show that he is not infallible,btohqsg
If individual catches that it is good,btohqsg
... and then he found God,btohqsg
No pastor meant to testify how God rectified that root within him,btohqsg
Deep seeded issues humans cant help themselves so god can lo thats his point,btohqsg
Actually quite a number in my school converted,btohqsg
Oh okay. No wonder you sound like it from what you just said,btohqsg
Ok lah i listen for main point,btohqsg
Sometimes pastors long winded i shut off,btohqsg
Hahaha. That's very honest of you,btohqsg
But when they convert  some dont tell their parents who are of a different faith,btohqsg
Some very cliche so i leave,btohqsg
Yeah  their parents can be very angry about it.,btohqsg
Anybody here got advice on how to study for pure literature?? O levels,btohqsg
Last 2 period of the day is pe,btohqsg
Cuz i failed my pure history,btohqsg
But remedial time starts at the same time as pe,btohqsg
Cuz combined sci and pure sci students end sch different,btohqsg
One thing to do is to make essay plans; find some practice questions  plan ur points  go through with a teacher in consultNext is to revise ur characters and themes; type up some notes about them  find some relevant evidence and explanations  so in exam u don’t need to make up the evidence and exp on the spotUnseen-wise  just keep practicing essay plans and go through with teacher too,btohqsg
By failing to plan ure planning to fail,btohqsg
For the L.E. part  (1) is that the modulus should also be on the L.E.   after that it’s not equal it’s proportional,btohqsg
Correct for the position of modulus but yes it should be proportional sign,btohqsg
All the best for your chem exam!,btohqsg
What do you mean by essay plans?,btohqsg
All the best to all taking prelims and promos today,btohqsg
May the odds be in your favour,btohqsg
I saw it as national service,btohqsg
Instead of writing a whole essay out  just write ur argument as a series of bullet points,btohqsg
Saves time  can consider more questions,btohqsg
Plus it helps u in the actual exam when u r planning ur essay,btohqsg
Same here. Except that 'Ns' was quite commonly used here before so I quickly realised it meant N level. Not sure if it refers to both NA and NT or one of them,btohqsg
Oh? I thought NA and NT exam papers were different. Then why have two different streams?,btohqsg
But NA more difficult than NY,btohqsg
K I wish you good luck,btohqsg
and DONT BE fking late for exam,btohqsg
Me and@cauchycriterionhave left school forever.Anyways  good luck and all the best to everyone taking exams today  whether it is prelims  promos  N levels or something else,btohqsg
Then I ask to change number,btohqsg
Normal SS paper ask me 1 a d b ce,btohqsg
I did not know how to do Shit,btohqsg
The N-LVL SS GIVE ME 1 to 5,btohqsg
Least you dont hv to touch ss,btohqsg
Didn’t see the question number wtf,btohqsg
THANK GOD THEY GIVE ME CHANCE LAH,btohqsg
Ye they changed the format LMAO,btohqsg
XD top scorer doesn't mean good okay,btohqsg
My geog I usually get 86 plus so that it can pull my Humanities to A1,btohqsg
Geography is my favourite subject HAHAHA,btohqsg
Except if its tourism cos i love tourism,btohqsg
Wow top scorer depends on geog instead of doing well for both ss and geography. :0,btohqsg
They don’t give 1 a to 1 e,btohqsg
T_T I’m having phobia of question numbers,btohqsg
Most of the 4 questions are asked in terms of message   purpose and 2 reliability,btohqsg
And the essay is abt chapter 3,btohqsg
The role of government in question 7,btohqsg
Suggest one way for singaporeans to make Singapore green and clean,btohqsg
Having to read source D   are your surprised with source E ?,btohqsg
Does sports event promote social harmony,btohqsg
So source A is a mix,btohqsg
Source D says No because of xenophobia,btohqsg
The one in bold at the top of qn,btohqsg
Next year cannot chapter 3 liao,btohqsg
Like it says 1 is negative,btohqsg
It is a ‘ simplicity ‘to believe,btohqsg
So it’s negative in the first paragraph,btohqsg
But I still put that source A says that it bring social harmony,btohqsg
So the sentence ‘ however ..... around the world ‘,btohqsg
Is positive which is the transition to the next pharaoh,btohqsg
And the change refers to I think it’s social harmony?,btohqsg
I put A and D for disagreement for question 5,btohqsg
Like the first paragraph says only,btohqsg
But the second paragraph says good thing s because of the inclusion of disability,btohqsg
The question 5 needs 2 agree and disagree,btohqsg
So I know A B C And E are agreeing,btohqsg
But only source D says bad things,btohqsg
Wat? Source B is not negative ? How is source B negative ?,btohqsg
When the athletes are smiling ?,btohqsg
if they give money maybe can promote peace,btohqsg
I survived .... except when I write the wrong question number . I felt like vomiting because of wrong question numbers T_T,btohqsg
Just I had to be careful for history exam also,btohqsg
The source based case study is about whether sports events promote social harmony,btohqsg
So it’s either a yes or no,btohqsg
The author disagrees but the fact that some call sports quixotic shows that it did not bring about social cohesion to some.,btohqsg
When are you going to show us? 🤔,btohqsg
Is there O level Ss today?,btohqsg
Because of writing wrong question number,btohqsg
I wrote 1 E instead of question 5,btohqsg
what did yall write for srq   6 & 7,btohqsg
i put the 3Rs and then mentioned about transport and govt healthcare scheme aka medifund hahah,btohqsg
also does it rly matter if one of the assertion question has the wrong inference etc,btohqsg
^ the type (e) kinds of qns,btohqsg
What do you mean by wrong inference?,btohqsg
I wrote for 6 go extra mile and pick up litter,btohqsg
like “ do u agree “ u put no but the ans suppose to be yes,btohqsg
Example would be by Ms Elina Ng programme ‘ a little at a time’,btohqsg
Hahahah i wrote pick up litter also,btohqsg
It was volunteer in organisations that pick up litter,btohqsg
7 is about FDO for safeguarding interest,btohqsg
And then about FDO for provision of goods and services,btohqsg
Like if you got 3 IEE,btohqsg
i tot it will minus like 2-3 nark oni,btohqsg
But I know 1 agree and 1 disagree is 5 ?,btohqsg
huh rly ah i rmb for prelims i wrote 2 full sources and halfway for one more source i got 7 marks HAHA,btohqsg
So the moral of the story for me when I took my combined humanities is that no matter how bad your answer is,btohqsg
You can get a lot of marks from it all the time.,btohqsg
Ummm it’s not measured by your length of answer,btohqsg
If you let say simple simple,btohqsg
i anyhow whack my prelim source e qns i got 7 so i kinda agree HAHAH,btohqsg
But not necessary have to write ah Ma story,btohqsg
i tot o level thrs only bellcurve,btohqsg
nvm ignore my advice it's quite risky to go by my way although it works for me,btohqsg
History so bad I thought we had a story,btohqsg
i cant geo at all lol,btohqsg
Geog depends on teacher but usually if you have a good one  possible to score 75 and above I guess,btohqsg
do yall think ur geog/hist can pull ur ss up HAHAH,btohqsg
Personally feel its a double edged sword,btohqsg
If you ask my class  the answer will be hell No but for me and my friend I think it pulled me up by 2 grades.,btohqsg
Geography is one of the subjects you can score full marks,btohqsg
unless you speedrun lorms with all marks,btohqsg
Depends. For me  my ss is way better than geography.,btohqsg
the problem is the time constraint,btohqsg
for me my humans all hopeless,btohqsg
(also anyone got last minute mugging advice my eoy’s is in like 1.5 week and i’ve revised nothing),btohqsg
If you are starting from scratch  dont bother,btohqsg
especially for humans since its very like practice based,btohqsg
For my sec 3 eoy  I never did a single practice paper,btohqsg
Tell that to my friends which score 100 and just passed their ss,btohqsg
geog is okay its better than my ss honestly HAHAH,btohqsg
Me and my friends have free tuition from a geog teacher,btohqsg
ss prob can study in 3 hours,btohqsg
It isn't that hard to score full marks for ss.,btohqsg
Hist prob can memorise 3 chapters in 1 day,btohqsg
i mean some of geog’s memorisation can be related to basic logic,btohqsg
English dont bother for compre  just focus on paper 1. Dont give shit handwriting,btohqsg
like legit every time i do i always barely pass  sometimes even fail,btohqsg
I always fail or just pass compre but paper 1 pull me to A2,btohqsg
i depend on my writing to pass,btohqsg
N level is different from o mate.,btohqsg
Agreed. I failed that for prelims,btohqsg
Based on what I remember  n level English isn't as difficult as o level.,btohqsg
my saving grace is section c summary,btohqsg
Ah well  n level is already over for me. :),btohqsg
I think English is very hard cause phrasing is very essential,btohqsg
But seriously my teacher minus 2 marks for handwriting oof,btohqsg
tbh here for all subjects phrasing is essential,btohqsg
one wrong word boom the cher cut off ur mark,btohqsg
science just memo and basic logic  math idc  english study format  humans memo?,btohqsg
for me is just geo memo,btohqsg
But english should think about plot,btohqsg
i usually do stuff on the spot lol for compo,btohqsg
its not like u can predict,btohqsg
Same but sometimes I do sit writing and compo together at the last hour,btohqsg
I've attained Minerva and I no longer feel hungry or thirsty. That's my biggest achievement.,btohqsg
Honestly I write about depressing stuff most of the time,btohqsg
Narrative essay is more about your writing style. Plot is pretty much cliché  difficulty lies in how well the story flows.,btohqsg
I wrote I had cancer myself and considered killing myself off for prelims,btohqsg
It is really hard to make your story stand out from the others.,btohqsg
Minerva is a Roman god I thjnk,btohqsg
isnt minerva the first name of professor mcgonagall or whatever her name is,btohqsg
She was named after the god,btohqsg
Anyways  I no longer feel the need to eat and drink. 😎,btohqsg
Hi guys is ns deferment automatic or will there be a letter,btohqsg
Cause a few of my friends got a letter,btohqsg
But theyre in poly im not sure if that makes a difference,btohqsg
How do I improve English compre. The visual text.For Sec 3,btohqsg
Oh you j1 this year ah,btohqsg
do you think the pace is slow,btohqsg
The chemistry a bit weird leh,btohqsg
I thought be like chapter 9 minimum,btohqsg
Basically Ksp is sort of a measure of how soluble a compound is,btohqsg
Says the one who's disproving the entire theory of bonding,btohqsg
I’ve left school forever too lol,btohqsg
Still not the most cancerous thing in h2 chem 😎😎,btohqsg
What’s the most cancerous thing in H2 chem?,btohqsg
Which isn't even tested this year,btohqsg
i think covid extending till next year,btohqsg
I think questions on isomerism are quite time-consuming,btohqsg
I mean we can't even attend lectures,btohqsg
Some students never even see their LT,btohqsg
Just sleep in online classes 😎😎,btohqsg
Some people even without covid also never see their LT before,btohqsg
I hated all the songs in my playlist that I played during orientation,btohqsg
Orientation rite all they do is scream cheers like a madman,btohqsg
Orientation can be quite fun if u try to get in the mood,btohqsg
It's just that I drink water slowly yes,btohqsg
Take off for rest of day,btohqsg
Sick bay is everyone's best friend,btohqsg
I go for 30mins stand in front of fan,btohqsg
Haha have fun covid is going on,btohqsg
Zzz back then the gurl I danced with was shaking,btohqsg
Wait is it normal for you guys to dance with girls?,btohqsg
My school is find anyone can,btohqsg
We had to dance with girls,btohqsg
unless got more guys than girls,btohqsg
no lah my bio class got 6 boys only,btohqsg
One guy in my class asked teacher,btohqsg
He said they are to trap more dust,btohqsg
I heard of an arts class in tmjc with only 1 guy,btohqsg
The girls literally stared at him,btohqsg
They try to match us up with opposite gender,btohqsg
Ur guess is as good as mine,btohqsg
Acjc has a lot of single gender school affiliations,btohqsg
Some say to promote class bonding but we know it's govt's policy to have smart ppl date smart ppl so that can have smart children idk what's this stupid logic,btohqsg
So u could say that it’s to help those from single gender schools to get used to the other gender,btohqsg
Is it time for the mandatory,btohqsg
Eh wait no rod for me,btohqsg
there's this china guy near me,btohqsg
i think he just beat his daughter and wife,btohqsg
I can't identify where the noise is coming from,btohqsg
I'm planning to stay up late these few days to see where the noise is coming from before reporting,btohqsg
I understand domestic violence is on the rise during this pandemic as people are suffering financially and people are staying home,btohqsg
Technically not our area u need call 18007770000 or 18002220000,btohqsg
The cries seriously creeped me out,btohqsg
It's a couple that recently came from China because I have never heard them once in my entire life.,btohqsg
How do you know they are from China,btohqsg
I hold citizenship here  never held chinese citizenship and speak mandarin like a mainlander,btohqsg
the accent is the exact same,btohqsg
So I'm from China despite holding citizenship in Singapore since birth?,btohqsg
So sad. I feel sorry for the victims,btohqsg
They have an accent of someone from China so they would lean towards looking like one bah. Easier to find that way,btohqsg
Like chinese couple with female daughter,btohqsg
the looks might be distinct on them who knows idk,btohqsg
yea I filed a report already now I am just waiting for them to get back to me,btohqsg
They could be citizens of Singapore already. You cannot conclude they are chinese citizens like that.,btohqsg
I am saying that they can resemble someone from China,btohqsg
I mean what else can I give the police to identify other than daughter and opposite block,btohqsg
So I just dump everything I hear out,btohqsg
like the accent what time they scream etc,btohqsg
idk this is just creeping me out I hope they don't get abused,btohqsg
It's just that I was scared to report last time so I took no chances this time  report first to be safe.,btohqsg
SG secure is ready to help,btohqsg
Does anybody here know how to revise for practical,btohqsg
English N-lvl paper 1 and 2 done,btohqsg
‘Online shopping vs in stores ‘,btohqsg
What you all wrote ah for essay ?,btohqsg
Nice topic to write not too difficult,btohqsg
I wonder who wrote question 3,btohqsg
Came out in my school common test I think 😂,btohqsg
Question 3 says write abt your experience playing games,btohqsg
And why you love to play games,btohqsg
For what subject and ask in the study group,btohqsg
Like cooking ? Yes .... cook,btohqsg
Then can tell which one is acid and alkali,btohqsg
Yep correct  if you all take chem at o lvls u all shld know why ^_^,btohqsg
Acids have a bitter tasteUnder acid and bases chapter,btohqsg
I thought acids are sour? No?I forgot everything...,btohqsg
I almost always take coffee before exams,btohqsg
Later I show you all the insert,btohqsg
Coffee is bitter due to presence of alkaloids,btohqsg
I thought coffee that is left for a long time will turn sour?,btohqsg
Alkaloids are weakly basic but coffee contains acids too,btohqsg
You will realise that you need it in JC quite often  maybe so in poly,btohqsg
But I try not to take coffee too often as it is addictive,btohqsg
Looks like I’m addicted to almonds,btohqsg
Anyone have the N level English paper 1 and 2?,btohqsg
I would put it in both chat and study group,btohqsg
what was the type of situational writing they tested on?,btohqsg
You have to share with children,btohqsg
rip so no speech for o levels then,btohqsg
At the same age as me =_=,btohqsg
I make a east coast plan speech,btohqsg
S P E E C H,btohqsg
The only speech that we have here is the oath of allegiance,btohqsg
And SEAB take east coast plan for real,btohqsg
So this was their infamous east coast plan,btohqsg
i quite like this topic tho ngl,btohqsg
Whoever wrote we care at East coast,btohqsg
do u have the qns for continuous writing,btohqsg
But I know what question is for 3 and 6,btohqsg
Do you prefer to shop online or to shop in a mall,btohqsg
Write about your experience playing game,btohqsg
And tell me why you love to play the game,btohqsg
I wanted to do this question,btohqsg
But sadly I don't want to lose so much mark,btohqsg
Imagine writing this essay  I would turn insane,btohqsg
I would write my favorite game is League of legends. Because I can flame at people  troll and go to boyfriend house and blame them more lmao,btohqsg
Question 5 is about someone changing your perspective of them through some sort of kind gesture they’ve done to you,btohqsg
I jumped straight to 5 cause it’s a recount hahaha,btohqsg
They said two separate words to hurry,btohqsg
Idt it’s immediate tho cause it stated “immediate danger”,btohqsg
That's the closest you can get,btohqsg
You had a big mouth open,btohqsg
Weird question but do You guys think that the markers would mind if I didn’t write down the number of words I’ve written for my summary? Lol,btohqsg
Swallow literally means to eat up with one mouth,btohqsg
They would count for you lor,btohqsg
Maybe n level they not so strict,btohqsg
Cl tmr gona be lit sleep for 1 hour,btohqsg
I’m betting on my humans and amath hahaha,btohqsg
Nah fam alr dying in sec 4,btohqsg
Cause like I don’t want to stress out and go thru the same thing again,btohqsg
Oral got one ang moh staring at me,btohqsg
Then Cambridge marker suddenly feel like Samaning me,btohqsg
Mine is 5  prelims and N.,btohqsg
I 9 because my English suck,btohqsg
I guess im just gon go temple pray,btohqsg
My English like 3 only eh,btohqsg
No lah emb3 is only 5 subs hahaha,btohqsg
Unless she got 1 for all,btohqsg
Wah i lucky sia 80 words zhun zhun for summary,btohqsg
wah  that means her English very good eh,btohqsg
Then on Friday it’s english lostening!,btohqsg
Bruh i sleep 12 hours also sleep today sia wtf,btohqsg
What am i supposed to do,btohqsg
Wow  12 hours...How long has it been since I've slept for 12 hours. 😔,btohqsg
Aite imma go watch ton of sing china with subtitles in hopes of using those words for tmr chinese compre and compo,btohqsg
How bout just go to sleep,btohqsg
And remind yourself that Chinese is never gonna be in your emb3,btohqsg
I try my hardest for prelim still get grade 5,btohqsg
Ima try my hardest to try not to do work cause having 0 in your report book is amazing,btohqsg
Furthermore  I feel that gce chinese is less strict.I've been failing or scoring 50-51% for Chinese but I scored a 4 for N and O.,btohqsg
At least you got good English grade =_=,btohqsg
What happens when u did not write the composition qn number down for paper 1?,btohqsg
I didn’t write number for my chinese P1 too,btohqsg
They will find the correct question,btohqsg
My Cher say they will mark the first question,btohqsg
Not sure if it is stated in the Cambridge report for past years....,btohqsg
Anyway  don’t stress over this too much,btohqsg
AFAIK markers try their hardest to give you marks lol,btohqsg
They are probably not gonna penalise you for not writing question number,btohqsg
Hi guys sorry asking again haha does anyone remember their section C first qn answer,btohqsg
Like the one that u have to put in the letters,btohqsg
I didn’t write anything for first question for section C,btohqsg
guys is it a must to not quote for evidence on the last qn for section b? for choosing either student a or b,btohqsg
It is best to put a custom quote,btohqsg
oh sry i meant paper 2,btohqsg
For last question in paper 2,btohqsg
If you say either a or b,btohqsg
You need to go to the text and check each sentences if it proves what a or b says,btohqsg
So it’s easier if you understand the story better,btohqsg
Then you are more likely to find the evidence,btohqsg
oh yea same  but I quoted my evidence tho,btohqsg
If people ask how are you  you going to reply I ate chicken rice?,btohqsg
As for this  I'm not too sure about n level format.,btohqsg
Because if your paraphrasing let say is horrible,btohqsg
Then it’s no choice for NA,btohqsg
It must make sense to the question,btohqsg
And if it change the meaning of you paraphrase,btohqsg
well hopefully it does becuz i messed up for paper 1,btohqsg
Then there would be chances that you would lose marks,btohqsg
So I recommend you to quote,btohqsg
No I paraphrase for paper 2,btohqsg
You guys discussing about tdy english paper?,btohqsg
Okay is the writer a chef??,btohqsg
