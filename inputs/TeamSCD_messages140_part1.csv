It's like a laptop. Some people's laptop screen spoil  some is harddisk spoil  maybe yours is mobo spoil,btohqsg
then how to know how much to maintain the laptop,btohqsg
Of course more sporty cars or lux cars have higher maintenance,btohqsg
Like Audi  mercs  BMW and so on,btohqsg
If it's your first car  highly suggest something cheap,btohqsg
If you have the budget  can go for swift sport 1.4T mild hybrid,btohqsg
It's spacious for 4 adults and boot isn't lacking,btohqsg
older generations of swift the rear seats very cramp. Knees are constantly touching front seats,btohqsg
But at the end of the day  it's very hard to advise you. There are literally thousands of cars out there. If you can narrow down your budget  the type of cars you want/expect,btohqsg
I would recommend KDM  usually value for money  say maybe avante a lot of features most jdm of its categories wont have.,btohqsg
