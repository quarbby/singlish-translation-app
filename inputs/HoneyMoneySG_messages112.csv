I rethink again. The day end closing balance of the account on 01 June is zero. Hence  Technically 01 July should be ok  correct? Just need somebody to take the risk to try it out.,btohqsg
Grey. It implies funds moved out. Not day end balance. I go with Mx kiasi approach better. No loss. Just $5k more put in,btohqsg
HSBC is my favourite bank now.UOB 2nd,btohqsg
Hi 1). Chan brother is under 4722. Citi rewards exclude it.2). If use Kris+   mcc 7991 but Citi rewards cap it $1k for 4mpd. You get 0.4mpd for the rest of $9k.3). Best is to pay using Kris+ linked to UOB Krisflyer. You get 3+1 mpd.,btohqsg
Thank you! Will definitely look into detail,btohqsg
Chanbro can spilt bill de.i always do so haha,btohqsg
still can  but there's a worse option for $5,btohqsg
Take at least 4 month to accumulate 20 lol,btohqsg
Hi guys will be buying a phone through Singtel ~$800  which card will be the best for this? MCC should be under Singtel telco also right? ,btohqsg
This valid for new account only,btohqsg
Oh let me read the website one more time. Thanks üôè,btohqsg
This hack doesn't work for 360 right ?,btohqsg
Oh  is it only DBS? All other banks are based on posted date?,btohqsg
can consider this SCB Save Up Level Up Promo too if UOB is so tricky to participate in next Quarter..,btohqsg
Nice  my good friend SC SULU is back (but may not be as good as the previous one due to Bonus$aver nerf),btohqsg

Is there any recommendation for single credit card strategiesCurrently have a UOB one accountConsidering HSBC revolution or UOB EVOLSpending habits include simplygo and mainly online shopping,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure if I applied correctly  but I want to apply for Vickers Cash Upfront but dbs email subject stating DBS Vickers Securities Trading Account.. is it the same thing?,btohqsg
the account name is the securities tradingcash upfront is how you buy the stocks or securities etc,btohqsg
Hahaha sign up gifts kinda meh currently,btohqsg
UOB evol with UOB one account makes the most sense,btohqsg
HSBC revo doesn't have annual fee. Can sign up  spend then claim rewards. Redeem yr points as cashback when there is promo. Use UOB evol for actual expenses and UOB one interest.,btohqsg
Your spending habits doesn‚Äôt suit hsbc Evo as much as evol does,btohqsg
"I think this may not work. Cause the clause states *promotion period*  which encompass 1 jul to 30 sep. Means the end point is 1st Jul regardless of when we choose to participate. So 1st jun is a coin flip now on whether its included in the ""30 days""I also trfed out on 1st Jun. Anyway no harm just registering and putting the fund back in and see if its earmarked. Can always call the CSO to confirm eligibility few days after registering",btohqsg
Actually yea can just apply for both,btohqsg
Dbs yuu card payment at singtel gives 17.5% rebate in yuu points with min spend of $600 within the calendar month. Suits your purchase very well,btohqsg
For SCB e$aver TnC  Cl. 2b defines fresh funds period must be more than 30 days.Wondering if its February with 28 days  how will it work üòÖ,btohqsg
Does Yuu give rebate for Singtel bill?,btohqsg
Although you will max out the bonus yuu points cap so the effective rebate is less  but still good,btohqsg
Wow exactly suits me  thanks for your recommendation,btohqsg

Chris. Nice to read your 1 way trip taking first class flight to shanghai. 58 500 miles..... a good experience,btohqsg
If you plan early your MAB can be 150k without the last day ü§™,btohqsg
The system can do it  why need to manual investigation?,btohqsg
Doubt it will work. Based on clause it states 30 days before promotion period. If the promotion period is 1 Jul  30 days before is always 1 Jun.,btohqsg
Hi any idea for krisflyer miles redemption  which bank process them the fastest. Ocbc  citibank  uob  dbs? Or all about the same,btohqsg
Only corporate GIRO/FAST/PayNow. Based on data points.,btohqsg
It does not matter. D-30. January exists.,btohqsg
I redeemed on UOB for first time and took 2 days  preregistration done earlier. I guess most banks should be faster.,btohqsg
Oh ya true hor! That one need super foresight.$155k all the way until last day of month withdraw!,btohqsg
Back to simple maths. 150k MAB for 30 days will be about 155.2k for 29 days.,btohqsg
Crap. I would have done $155k without the $200 üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Then you won't have 150k MAB for months with 30 days. 31 days yes.,btohqsg
‚ÄúAny top up or payment of funds to payment service provider ‚ÄúCan I check what are some payment service providers?,btohqsg
Thanks. What u mean by pre-registration?,btohqsg
Frequent Flyer Program enrolment via UOB online form.,btohqsg
May I check for IRAS and payment for billing online is this consider as online transaction?,btohqsg
which credit card is good to use for insurance payment?,btohqsg
I tried FAST recently from my personal account - didn't work  so you are right.,btohqsg
"Maybank Platinum Visa is one of them. Can search ""insurance cards"" for more info.",btohqsg
Sometimes can same day get for UOB. I transfer every few months as I got points expire incrementally,btohqsg
You transfer uob which card to kris flyer?,btohqsg
Every few months transfer means you must have spend a lot on the card.,btohqsg
anyone signed up for uob lazada card ?,btohqsg
Every transfer you pay $27 or $25 admin fee?,btohqsg
UOB VI can transfer for free. So just use only,btohqsg
I have a few cards but because UOB miles can pool. So I just use the VI card to transfer for free,btohqsg
Tested with a different bank account name it works,btohqsg
Maybe has to be different account name. ü§î,btohqsg
Yea I doubt same name like uob works  at least not what I seen,btohqsg
Maybe try what samsam said  transfer from another person's account.,btohqsg
For insurance payment   to use Maybank platinum visa or pair with cardup better ?,btohqsg
Depends if you can clock the other 50% spend on Maybank Platinum Visa or not.,btohqsg
So the uob apps unable to check eg uob preferred platinum visa has how many points compare to hsbc apps can see each individual cardsÔºü,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt seem to find it on UOB. But my Citibank does show different cards with different amount of miles. I don‚Äôt have HSBC account so I‚Äôm not sure,btohqsg
Yes. Citi bank you can see it,btohqsg
I think UOB classifies everything as UNI$,btohqsg
Uob miles card are all pool bro. This one discuss before.,btohqsg
But if you go the rewards page can see some info. But not helpful,btohqsg
Yes. I don't want to claim all that is supposed to be under my uob ladies card,btohqsg
Means only claim what is belong to uob preferred visa,btohqsg
It doesnt matter  it is like a rojak and what you are trying to do is pick out the individual ingredient and try to categorise it .,btohqsg
Hi  I need some advice.1) If i spent $1k intrip.comand I cancel and rebook at $900 intrip.comusing amaze card. Will i be charge with 1% fees?2) If I spend $1k link uob lady with amaze card and I cancel and rebook with Uob lady card direct  do I still earn bonus points?,btohqsg
Nice that you managed to redeem on a saver rate. I only managed to redeem my first class flight at an advantage rate  although I redeemed 355 days in advance,btohqsg
Why are you using Amaze? Change currency to SGD and check the amount  sometimes it‚Äôs better than bank conversion,btohqsg
If u exceed the 1k limit for local transaction then yes u will incur fee but why u using uob lady with amaze if is local currency U still earn bonus point on the uob lady for the 900 after the 1k is refunded and deduct accordingly,btohqsg
Bro. I believe if you book on black out dates means spontaneous escape. Maybe cheaper on the miles,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtprobably need to call them again lol. Keep saying mobile key not setup when they already authenticated me via mobile key. Kinda fucked up their system. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èEdit: Apparently Mobile Key can get bugged locally on the device. Wonder what they actually store on the device now.,btohqsg
When does HSBC credit the interest ? What date,btohqsg
Why never receive ah? Me too didn't receive,btohqsg
You already got banned in so many group because you like to give advise and always give wrong advise. Why not you just learn and not try to answer or give any advice? Better that way than to mislead people who may be new to collecting miles,btohqsg
Ok . You can help answer my question. How to check uob preferred visa total how many points balance in uob apps,btohqsg
Bro. I don't want to see total pool points. Just want to see uob preferred visa.,btohqsg
Honestly why does it matter which cards is the points from? When the miles are all pooledAnd I believe on the UOB app you are able to see the points is credited for which card and transaction.,btohqsg
Have you tried using Excel to track your points?,btohqsg
UOB UNI$ are pooled together. Why would you even bother with knowing just the PPV card ? lol,btohqsg
Please don't torture us with this kind of question. You can call UOB Hotline or chat and torture the CSO .. ü§£,btohqsg
Maybe the CSO alrd told him the same thing but he still want to try his luck if it‚Äôs possible.,btohqsg
Because I want to redeem just the points for uob preferred visa. Points belong to uob ladies. I do not want to transfer to kris flyer,btohqsg
wtf  if it‚Äôs pooled tgt  does it even matter?,btohqsg
Can see individual transaction for PPV  cannot PPV total as all cards are pooled. 1 base and 9 bonus per $5 spent.,btohqsg
Of course. He don't want to transfer to kris flyer,btohqsg
No.. I not sure.. and I google also can't find answer,btohqsg
Bro. I only keen to transfer only all the points from uob preferred visa.... before I cancel it,btohqsg
I tot even if you cancel one card  the pool still remains the same?,btohqsg
Maybe he needs ladies to answer him next since all the guys answered le. Please give him your answer,btohqsg
Alright.. I shall google and transfer points.. and also keep quiet... if not later also ban here. I scare.,btohqsg
Actually I got a super good idea for you  next time you sign up those credit cards that pool miles tgt  you sign up under two different names. Then different pool liao,btohqsg
HM got terryML got SuiBringing me joy and laughter everyday üòÖ,btohqsg
HM is the only chat group that hasn't banned you... yet.,btohqsg
Bro. Forgive and forget. Everyone makes mistake. I also still learning,btohqsg
all the ML  Sethisfy  even Heymax i think.,btohqsg
He's (still) considered harmless. His special advice is not blatantly wrong (yet).,btohqsg
I'm not admin. I remember Chris said you're harmless. so just don't keep misleading with bad advice I think you're fine.,btohqsg
Can I ask if anyone can advise on what are the potential tradeoffs between getting a DSB Altitude Amex vs Visa card? Cos‚Äô there is a differential in the awarded bonus miles.,btohqsg
I already gave admin permission to take action when required already  please monitor yourself,btohqsg
I guess certain things still makes sense to a certain extent,btohqsg
Honestly only scams and spams get banned. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Sui only haunting (joking) all the ML main and sub groups. I think.,btohqsg
I got say before ah u can educated other but u cant fix brain loop. Especially funny loop,btohqsg
I thought the uob pool discussion should be finish last week  dont know how it come up again this week. Infinity loop,btohqsg
Webull 8.4% promo only apply to USD fund?,btohqsg

Hi Guys and ladies. I don't mind sharing this . I just google and found this.. in the benefits of doubt . I think through about 5 mins .. I think is worth while let the bank transfer for you monthly the 10k miles to kris flyer... while you enrol for the programme and pay a 1 time annual fee of $50,btohqsg
10k miles? This is kinda a lockup that you can only convert to KF miles. What if I dowan to take SQ?Feels like this is only applicable to people with high spending that is able to hit the min uni$ of 15k for conversion of more than 2 times to make it worthwhile,btohqsg
Sorry . Typing error. Is 5k miles each time,btohqsg
Why need to auto convert  the expiry is faster and u miss conversion promotion (although rare),btohqsg
This one you tell him don‚Äôt tell me,btohqsg
This‚Ä¶ no good‚Ä¶.You know UOB can transfer for free right?Free one better  why pay?,btohqsg
Hi  did anyone try the VIP lounge provided by Trip dot com before ?,btohqsg
Hi bro. Can call up tomorrow morning to cancel ?,btohqsg
Which cards are u using ? Can share ?,btohqsg
How is it ? Is it Sats lounge ?,btohqsg
Err  it is a lounge. Not sure what to say.You can see the lounge provided at the point of booking  it differs based on terminal,btohqsg
I am new to uob krisflyer  upon looking through the details if I didn't spend $800 annually on Singapore airline group  I won't get 3mpd ?,btohqsg

You are welcome.Tomorrow you go Orchard UOB  got one long escalator go up. You walk in and say you want to free miles transfer. They will escort you to the correct counter.No need thank me‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
You mean can don't need to pay. I thought transfer miles need to pay min 25$,btohqsg
Just follow my advice. Go there physically  you will know the answer‚Ä¶,btohqsg
How about go the one at vivo city. There can do it ?,btohqsg
I stay near Orchard  Vivo got UOB?,btohqsg
You mean. The frequent flyer conversion programme can don't need to pay ?,btohqsg
Yes. Almost every miles chat mention before. You been to so many groups  simple search can find liao.,btohqsg
What was the name of the guy in Seth‚Äôs chat who recommended PayAll in every occasion? Even if you could pay directly using CC  still he recommended to use PayAll üòÇ IIRC Anh?,btohqsg
Ok. . I go to the bank tomorrow,btohqsg
I know he is annoying‚Ä¶ But this one too harsh  let‚Äôs remain humane üòâTransfer fee iswaivedif you have UOB Visa Infinite Metal only.,btohqsg
The free Privilege Banking Card also free transfer of miles. üôÇ,btohqsg
Oh i din know  so private customer can request free transfer? Damn it  my dad holding the privilege banking so long also din know,btohqsg
During transfer  just select the correct card  then won‚Äôt be charged $25.Because miles are pooled  don‚Äôt care from PPV or Lady card. üòá,btohqsg
They put privilege banking printing on my dad vs card,btohqsg
Coz my dad dont want to pay annual fee for the uob vi  he seldom use,btohqsg
Go branch can process anot ah for private customer,btohqsg
Yup. PBC can request waiver‚Ä¶ subjected to bank approval.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt waste time if you already got the card  can do online or call in.,btohqsg
Kk  next time i get dad to ask. Waste a few transfer fee. My dad been a private customer so long but nvr know or use such service lol,btohqsg
You have to thanks our most helpful bro Terry Wong. üòÅ,btohqsg
Orchard UOB got what free facilities to enjoy?,btohqsg
Got ppl to talk to for free üëçüèª,btohqsg
According to website  privilege banking needs $350k.Is it $350k deposit can get privilege banking n free transfer of  miles ?Mt shall be very happy to hear this.,btohqsg
Are you granny‚Äôs agent?She said you introduced her to miles game with UOB üòÇ,btohqsg
Tats why I asked what so special abt orchard UOB?,btohqsg
If you've PB Card/VIM  when you redeem miles on app/online  just choose the PB Card/VIM Card and it will be free. Don't need to go branch.,btohqsg
Is it too late to use card up for income tax payment ?If I cancel current payment plan on income tax   iras mentioned it has to be paid full balance once cancel payment plan .How ?,btohqsg
You mean monthly giro payment plan? Can just pay remaining amount with cardup. No need cancel payment plan.,btohqsg
So just put the date payment earlier on card up than current date giro payment plan ?That‚Äôs it ?,btohqsg
Do not cancel GIRO payment plan.If you paid CardUp in Jun (based on CardUp recommendation - 12 Jun)  you're paying for Jul's tax payment (first GIRO deduction date for Jul - 6 Jul).For Jun  it will be paid through GIRO.,btohqsg
Just checked current giro payment plan is on 6th every month. So I should put every 5th new month in card up,btohqsg
Hi   currently i am paying for a investment monthly to tokio marine . When enter tokio marine under heymax   it shows maybank platinum card. Can i safely conclude it is entitled for cashback ?,btohqsg
Yes but please read up how the card work,btohqsg
Better put it 5 days before your giro date to have enough time for processing,btohqsg
Merchant accessibility (not all places accept amex) and 2x annual lounge access.I recommend visa cuz thats what i got and lounge access is the only reason I'm still keeping this card.,btohqsg
Safest 12th  but if you want to push it  29th. Anything after might end up becoming following month.,btohqsg
Latest update.Dbs adds themselves to exclusion list to cardup.  Unable to use anymore to cardup.,btohqsg
Wait where u got that info,btohqsg
can see DBS TnC2.6 DBS Points will not be awarded for bill payments and all transactions via AXS (except Pay+Earn)  CardUp  eNETS  Fave eCard  FavePay  ipaymy  SAM and SmoovPay,btohqsg
From milelion and double check against dbs Terms and conditions.  See above,btohqsg
for all DBS cards. I use it with my DBS vantage to get 1.5mpd,btohqsg
Nope. I won‚Äôt lock up $350k with Uob retail bank.,btohqsg
Suddenly I have this question not sure if anyone can help‚Ä¶So for UOB.. their points is rewards in $5 spend block right‚Ä¶If I spend $249 in a single transaction and made 4 of these transaction. I wud have spend $996.But the ‚Äúlast‚Äù $4 in the $249 is not eligible for points right?So does it means I have another $4x4 to spend to earn the points?  Or rather $15 to spend to get the points?Not sure if I explain my qn clearly though.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm talking about UOB Lady‚Äôs card $1000.,btohqsg
Lady works a bit different. You will earn 980 worth of base points (0.4mpd) due to 5 dollars block but 995 worth of 9x points (3.6 mpd) as UOB lady calc bonus points all together at the end of calendar month.,btohqsg
But yes  what u said applied to card like UOB PPV.,btohqsg
I also feel sound like preferred platinum visa,btohqsg
If you read the t&c  there's a clause to show the fulfilment date.,btohqsg
The points system works the same as lady‚Äôs card right?,btohqsg
Hi all  I want to subscribe virtual machine from Parallels Desktop. Any idea if the HSBC revolution or Kris amex (blue) can get miles?parallels.com,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a little different. PPV works at per transaction level for both base and bonus bonus points calculation. Lady‚Äôs works at per transaction for base  but consolidated total spend for bonus calculation.,btohqsg
Not sure how it happened but I remember when I was young  my father wanted to buy house  and borrow from loanshark.Then I joint account with my mum go UOB open temporary account.The status stuck until now with no money inside. The money was only in the account for a very short time  maybe a few weeks only.When I started working my first job $1.8k per month  this card was offered to me for free AF waiver. (But every year need to waive.),btohqsg
Hi Guys and ladies.I check with you . If I choose 1 time conversation to miles.Blocks of uni 5000 = 10k miles.I have 25k uni points.Can I one shot redeem all ?,btohqsg
Wah it is the best card to buy miles.,btohqsg
Anyone knows when UOB fund will be earmarked when I put in my fund on 30 Apr?,btohqsg
When did u register the sms?,btohqsg
Are you sure you need all that miles?Convert what you need  if miles is not expiring soon.Otherwise miles in KF will start their expiration.,btohqsg
He don‚Äôt want orphan miles iykyk,btohqsg
Miles that u dont have enough to claim as a block  e.g. 10k miles minimum usually,btohqsg
Anyone use shopee paylater before? Is all 3 installments considered online for Citi rewards?,btohqsg
It means bank only allow you to convert in blocks of 10k miles.So if you convert everything  will have 9 951 miles left that cannot be converted.Have to spend another $41 to make it pass 10k miles block to be eligible for conversion.,btohqsg
You waiting to claim 4x RTW business? üòÇ,btohqsg
I thought RTW already no more?,btohqsg
I send my msg on 30 Apr,btohqsg
Hi all.. just want to check/ ask whats a good card to accumulate miles? will be using the card for all spending‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Still have I think  except SQ No longer participates for award redemption,btohqsg
If in apr and nothing was wrong  should have been earmarked in May.,btohqsg
Too much miles in KF already. Already expired a lot. ü•≤ And buy a lot concert tickets. Booked all holidays until 2025 liao‚Ä¶.Thinking to play other FFP  learning from Suitesmile. ü•∞,btohqsg
Oic. Means need to transfer our miles to other FFP to redeem  right?,btohqsg
I also looking at exploring other FFP haha,btohqsg
Sorry. What does that mean?I play miles so long  never used the RTW once leh‚Ä¶,btohqsg
This one i not sure leh. There's a possibility still can claim through SQ but.. no SQ flights.I.e. CSO help with booking on Star Alliance,btohqsg
good if you have long leave period or retirees. Booked for my parents before. Very worth it as Business to US already 240k miles i think.,btohqsg
Ya.Fai said AirFrance good. I check  it‚Äôs not bad  but the YQ is shockingly high‚Ä¶ but kids miles is discounted. So you use less miles but more cash output. Still a little cheaper than KF.But then that‚Äôs how you get actual ORPHAN MILES! üòÇüòÖ,btohqsg
I used airfrance for my domestic europe flight. I checked the booking and i thought X amount of miles is for 1 pax.. then i transferred for 2pax... And THEN realised.. the X amount is actually already for 2 pax..Another way to get orphan miles.. lo,btohqsg
2023 was also the year I do stupid things like Advantage Suites from PVG-SIN due to expiring miles at 98k üòÇBut consolation is the 2nd leg SIN-CGK  which allows me to YOLO travel to a city that I never would think of going. üòÇAnd Marriott was nice to have the promo of stay 2N get 35k Bonvoy which I stayed at Pacific RC for free. Amazing property.Forced miles spending is good  go out of my comfort zone.,btohqsg
Wah your parents Adventurous! ü•∞RTW very worth it!,btohqsg
Ya sia! I choose 2A1C ma‚Ä¶Then I always think‚Ä¶ walao‚Ä¶ this is ridiculously.Until recently Fai said the child discounted then I noticed it‚Äôs the TOTAL miles required during searching liao! WALAO! üòÇ,btohqsg
Good leh. Cos all the senpai will jump out to correct him  and not the 'what does the TnC say' reply üòÇ. Though too much message post in a day to scroll n read.,btohqsg
I like this chat because can divide my IQ by 2  and post without thinking too much. Maybe other chat I kenna banned liao.,btohqsg
I am not sure I want to be compared to their legendary status. üòÇ,btohqsg
Can pay income tax using cardup by splitting into 2 payment 500 each that link to OCBC 365 and Uob one card to qualify for 500 cc spent ?,btohqsg
Hi Expert   how to check OCBC Credit Card application status ?Thanks,btohqsg
If you not earmarked in May  you have did something wrong. How much was your Mar MAB?,btohqsg
Call ocbc customer service to check,btohqsg
if reject   they sent us message,btohqsg
I guess so? Didnt get rejected so someone else can input.,btohqsg
Ok if approve ? sent me something ? thanks,btohqsg
Reject will get letter.I applied two times  both failed with letter saying I did not hit the required $30k per annum salary.I had to show my $2.8k payslip and CPF to the OCBC staff 2nd time I applying at branch.But I still got rejected due to $30k salary income requirement‚Ä¶ ü•≤If you approved  they will sms or mail you your card.,btohqsg
Uob absolute Cashback amex charged annual fee. Does anyone know how to waive it? I use the uob app to apply for waiver but got rejected. Any advice?,btohqsg
Call the hotline and speak to CSO.,btohqsg
2.8 x 12 is more then 30k liao right?,btohqsg
So proud üòÑ i only apply for back up due to all ocbc card are not teir 1 or 2 or 3 card . Why so proud ? üòÄ,btohqsg
Exactly. That‚Äôs why I go their branch to complain and show my payslip & CPF the 2nd time lo. üòÖIt didn‚Äôt work. Same email from their department head stating the same reason again.,btohqsg
That happens to my uob visa card ... I give up... until I start to have uob stash account. I put in 6500. 6 months later become 10k. Then uob preferred visa starts to approved in 2021,btohqsg
Anyway eventually I find OCBC promos or miles program not very sincere  always got cuts there and there which is quite critical in one‚Äôs miles journey.Imagine you accumulate so long  then suddenly your points/miles worth suddenly changes rapidly.Especially the Voyage points that once said can redeem revenue tickets at affordable rates. I wonder how many managed to do it. ü§£,btohqsg
Stash account put $6500 good? How you turn it into $10k after only 6 months?,btohqsg
Just did right now  i received an acknowledgment SMS :¬´¬† Thank you for your interest in our promotion  we have received your submission of interest. Kindly ensure that you have submitted with the correct last 4 alphanumeric digits of your NRIC or Passport Number registered with UOB. Visit UOB PRVI Miles Card website for T&Cs.¬†¬ªYou did not receive this SMS ?,btohqsg
Yes I ytd managed to sign up for it! üëç,btohqsg
Anyone knows whats the best credit card for big ticket item overseas spending?,btohqsg
Oh great  good to hear. Did they send you an email or anything afterwards ?,btohqsg
for me i will use trustcard,btohqsg
But I received the sms text. Same as what you copied paste immediately after,btohqsg
ohh what are the perks? cashback or miles?,btohqsg
Okay  we‚Äôre in the same situation then haha  hope it won‚Äôt take 3 weeks ‚Ä¶ apparently that‚Äôs often the case with Uob,btohqsg
cashback in link points 0.5% and low fx spread   0 fees,btohqsg
thank you  that is helpful. Any miles card to recommend? am i right to say 2.4 miles is probably decent?,btohqsg
How big? Can use contactless? Can consider UOB Visa signature if between 1k-2k.,btohqsg
Think now maybank got promo in jun for fcy spending 3.2 miles for horizon and vi uncapped,btohqsg
Win 4d. And salary 2k saving,btohqsg
oh great thanks! do u have the link?,btohqsg
Huat ah! So lucky.I got wife with kid. $2.8k cannot save a single cent every month.,btohqsg
Check out maybank website or if u have treat app login,btohqsg
But you spend a lot.. to get so much miles accumulation,btohqsg
No choice have to borrow from future self. Life is tough. But still must earn miles.,btohqsg
Not difficult once you learn the tricks from miles gurus.Eat for free with Priority Pass.Fly for free with miles.,btohqsg
From when I see you guys can put so much $$ 100 to 200k into uob or hsbc.. must be strike toto...,btohqsg
Fly for cheap  not exactly free haha. Still got tax to pay. Like Chris mention still got opportunity cost when opt for miles over cashback card.,btohqsg
Main thing is expenses. 700k miles. Wow. I guess need to spent at least 120k to 200k per year. [after sign up promo],btohqsg
For UOB EBOL  Paying with Apple Pay on online merchants is it considered online payment ?,btohqsg
72 000 miles from PayAll means spent exactly 120K üòÇ,btohqsg
Why do you even put 10k in stash  there‚Äôs no interest on it first 10km also,btohqsg
You mean now .. previously they say 2.5 to 2.8 %,btohqsg
On 10k balance? In 2020 till now  10k balance doesn‚Äôt earn you bonus interest iirc,btohqsg
If we use Amaze+shopback/Favepay  insta points won‚Äôt be awarded?,btohqsg
Local transactions don't earn amaze pts,btohqsg
Then that answers your questions already,btohqsg
All the while I though local transactions are awarded with amaze points,btohqsg
thanks Chris  can i confirm its based on FCY x 7x treat points? and converted to KF miles I see MB recently adjusted 20k TP for 1 000 KF miles  can i confirm?,btohqsg
Oh no..  I misread...Bro. So I move the fund 10k to hsbc EGA to get 3.2% ?,btohqsg
Can confirm with Maybank  I don't hold this card yet,btohqsg
Move to where you think has a higher interest than 0.05,btohqsg
I thought someone in the group here say have 3% for stash account per month,btohqsg
Any reasons why they wont waive the charges?? Need to fulfil criteria of annual spending perhaps?,btohqsg
Maybe you can read the tnc and search the chat again. Believe we had provided screenshots to you the previous time you said stash gives 5% or something. And Chris sent you a video to explain the mechanics of it,btohqsg
I used my Amaze card + CRMC overseas for dining but I don‚Äôt get any insta points is there some delay or changes ?,btohqsg
I guess they don‚Äôt need a reason since they are not obligated to waive the annual fees?,btohqsg
Transactions posted? And is mcc not excluded by crmc?,btohqsg

Hi guys  just checking. does fast transfer SALA work for ocbc 360?,btohqsg
So hard to get for family of 3.,btohqsg
Can teach me how to transfer miles to them?,btohqsg
Yes. Cannot. From child to adult account can,btohqsg
Since we're talking about this  if I have a Krisflyer account  can I use my miles to buy tickets for my family as well?,btohqsg
My son a lot of miles. Later I try if can.,btohqsg
Same here and I have a payment scheduled with cardup. Looks like have to cancel.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know where to find the MCC eligibility list for Amex True Cashback card? I tried searching and only managed to find TNC documents without the eligible MCC information TIA!Specifically  I want to know if it covers MCC 7011,btohqsg
I heard they will update again terms n conditions,btohqsg
‚ÄúDo note that linking of accounts is permanent and cannot be changed or reversed. The accounts will automatically be delinked once LITTLE MX turns 16.‚ÄùWow. So cool. üòé,btohqsg
I would say amaze + Uob krisflyer cc. If mcc matches whitelist.,btohqsg
Ok nvm. I did a quick search and found this. Sharing for everyone's benefit.,btohqsg
My rm worded it as bank has their own assessment criteria (ie not telling you). But if topup to $200k he has a better case (suggested sure can approve) for annual fee waiver.Suspect it is a tactic to get small priority banking accounts to top up assets.,btohqsg
Instant for me. (Existing scb credit card holder),btohqsg
I'm new user . Still waiting approve,btohqsg
New user have to assess your profile and limits. So slower.Existing card holder just tag on a new card. No changes to limits or review needed.Not sure if credit bureau gets a ping / free report though. I think yes.,btohqsg
Hi all. Good day. I hope to gather some opinions here on investing my savings for passive income. Assuming you have 400k cash. How would you invest or save while preserving capital? Bearing in mind that out of 400k  50k has to be liquid in view of emergency use.,btohqsg

I have already watched this for some ideas. But don't have monthly salary  so no go for UOB One savings account.,btohqsg

Can I ask  if I want to participate 6 months T bills for upcoming using cash say $100k.. can I register first even if the cash is not in the bank yet? Probably will only be in next week,btohqsg
UOB one do not in salary from the company,btohqsg
you can send money from another one of your accounts as salary and UOB is fine with it,btohqsg
the next one will only be open on 12th june and close on 20th june. so why not wait for the money to be in then register?,btohqsg
Oh I thought there is a 30 May one? Okok maybe I will wait for 12 June instead,btohqsg
its closing in like 2 days,btohqsg
Bro. Means hsbc ega . 3% ++. Still better than scb esaver ?,btohqsg
What you asking? First you ask SCB eSaver and UOB Stash  suddenly you ask HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
Can someone share how to do the salary hack?,btohqsg
I checking is scb esaver better or similar to hsbc EGA in terms of annual interest earn,btohqsg
Oic. Interesting to know about this,btohqsg
If you don't have 2 person to control  just rotate the money each month between EGA (odd months) n Esaver (even months). This is not financial advise. üòÜ,btohqsg
I mean similar interest rate earn,btohqsg
Similar if exclude the additional 1% for EGA incremental.,btohqsg
CIMB Starsavers is offering 3.5% promo for June/July. Another option,btohqsg
Hihi.. can I check when does hsbc ega credit their normal interest? I know the incremental interest is after the promotion  ends,btohqsg
Also may I know when will they credit the everyday+ for GIRO ?,btohqsg
Ya. Sad. Didn't check cimb after they change to tier based interest earlier part of the year.,btohqsg
Hi guys  for those saver accounts like UOB One  Ocbc 360  SC saver  which is the best if i have 2 person  2 salary crediting  100k each?,btohqsg
Is OCBC the best cause i used the online calculator  i can get 4.1% by just salary crediting and increase average balance by 500 monthly with 100k  and this can be doubled if i have 2 accounts  no hassle of spending credit card or online giro etc.Any comments if i am considering this right?,btohqsg
if only those two things  then you might be right. I know UOB One will not pay that much for sure,btohqsg
Any suggestion on t bill 6 month cut off yield? Thanks,btohqsg
Hihi if I use Kris+ link to uob lady(travel)  also means I get 4+1 mpd ? I've decided to split my payment to maximize rewards,btohqsg

Will there be a switch in mcc if I use Kris+ to pay ?,btohqsg
For travel agency somehow mcc change,btohqsg
I see...but krisflyer uob card can use in conjunction with Kris+ not affecting the final reward 3+1 mpd?,btohqsg
UOB KF gets 3mpd as long as it's Kris+,btohqsg
Oh ya . You're right   missed out on that part,btohqsg
Amount will be debited from your account at the point of application,btohqsg
The upcoming one is closing tomorrow 9pm if using DBS,btohqsg
Without spending  you'll get 4.05% p.a. for 100k. Note that you'll get slightly lesser EIR if you have lesser or more than 100k. Best is to keep the EIR above 4% (UOB One account 150k gets 4% p.a. with just $500 spend and salary crediting). You also need have a reset month  which loses you 1.5% p.a. instantly (or whatever EIR the account give  wherever you transfer your monies to).98k = 4% p.a.100k = 4.05% p.a.101.5k = 3.99% p.a.If you have 2 humans with HSBC EGA  you get up to 4.45% p.a. (depending on promo) for amounts up to 360k. Just need to alternate the combined amount of 200k between each account. Only criteria is 2k deposit (fulfilled when you alternate account) and 5 outward transactions  and SMS registration for promo.,btohqsg
The next one will open 12 June and close on 19 June,btohqsg
And you also don‚Äôt have to do the $500 monthly increment. It takes effort to do that and having to reset periodically,btohqsg
"Have you tried searching ""UOB One salary credit""?",btohqsg
The EGA incremental average daily balance is max $2m instead of $360k,btohqsg
1% p.a. from Everyday+ Rewards only applies to first $300 (estimated 360k).,btohqsg
Do chris have any promotions link for this hsbc EGA. I can't find at his link,btohqsg
Does it mean that if premier  then the 1% is capped at approx $600k cos $500 Cashback? If there is other Cashback  like giro  then the incremental ADB is even lower?,btohqsg
Yes. I can't find the link for hsbc EGA account at chris link,btohqsg
I don't get your question. The 1% p.a. is capped at $300 per month. Doesn't matter premier or personal banking.,btohqsg
Have you tried scrolling to HSBC?,btohqsg
If you cannot see  just use Search@sgpromocode,btohqsg
For OCBC 360 account  in order to get the extra 1.2% from OCBC Invest  I need to invest 20k to unit trust. Is this 20k referring to the initial investment or the market value?,btohqsg
Ya market value float of course count by what u put in initially ah,btohqsg
Hi All Anyone play the Mari Saving and Mari Invest everyday with 10k to earn the double interest?,btohqsg
Double interest? Can elaborate more on the steps?,btohqsg
For your reference  it took 4 hours for SCB to reply me via email (rejection) after applying through Singsaver. Reapplied 2 weeks later directly via the SCB App and got instant approval.,btohqsg
Apply at bank apps is better,btohqsg
Interesting but when do Mari invest credit their returns?,btohqsg
U got exisiting acct or new acct ? I applied through their web,btohqsg
Later kena flag once bank catch up to it  not worth it for 10k haha,btohqsg
Nah it‚Äôs a digital bank and it‚Äôs moving internally lol,btohqsg
I encourage all brave warrior go try for extend period of time and then give data point,btohqsg
Same eh. I waited for 2 working days alr üòÇ,btohqsg
What‚Äôs your definition of extend period of time? Seems like the same logic as you buy and sell stocks in a day,btohqsg
The salary crediting doesn‚Äôt count as monthly increase? I mean i can put in 1800 and take out 1300 to achieve the criteria right? Assuming i have 100k in it  the only time i loses the 4% is whenever i take out the excess MAB  i.e. maybe once a year for 6k or 12k (assuming i put in 500 per month just to hit),btohqsg
Did you recently apply for any other credit cards? If yes  should re-try after all your credit card statements are generated.,btohqsg
No eh. I'm new to Standchart,btohqsg
If salary credit 1st of month. AVG bal increase $500,btohqsg
Technically it should work since you only need the ‚Äúaction‚Äù of crediting your salary and it doesn‚Äôt have to stay in your account for a working day to take into account as a salary credit.,btohqsg
UOB One does not require you to increase your MAB $500. You just need to do salary credit $1600 and spend $500 credit card transactions.,btohqsg
I meant  did you apply for any other credit cards from DBS/Citi/UOB recently?If yes  your credit report might look weird (e.g. citi queried but no citi credit card. It will appear as though citi rejected you),btohqsg
That is the good thing of UOB One over OCBC 360. I don‚Äôt need to ensure increase of MAB,btohqsg
Not worth the time and effort lol,btohqsg
Precisely  i just earmark 150k with uob one will do haha,btohqsg
I read the post saying that invest will usually credit around 6pm so the hack is1) maribank interest credit at 12:10am2) transfer 10k to Mari invest and it will be bought on the same day since it before 730am3)once Mari invest credit the returns  transfer back to Mari saving4) rinse and repeat,btohqsg
Not everyone as rich as you ma,btohqsg
I not rich lol. U can barely claim to be rich with 150k,btohqsg
Some don‚Äôt even have 100k much less 150k,btohqsg
Coz other is either young or have asset like cpf  flat. I have none but cash niah,btohqsg
To be safe  $500 self transfer in on the 1st day ideally (more if 1st day is non-business day - adjust accordingly if 2nd day as well...). Then when salary credits  pull out the whole salary amount.,btohqsg
He don't intend to hit $500 spend if you see his OP.,btohqsg
Or just sleep at night soundly,btohqsg
But technically i can just do a recurring transfer of $500 by 28 every month  to make sure MAB increase by 500 right? Then i can transfer out all my salary regardless of when it comes in?,btohqsg
Not like y‚Äôall sleep early also haha,btohqsg
Then your MAB does not increase by $500.,btohqsg
Please teach me how to get started with miles games! üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg
Why 28th? Your MAB is not going to increase by 500 with just 500 on 28thIf you want to be lazy  then you set a recurring on the 1st for 500  but if you meet with a public holiday or non working day  then the next time you check  you will need to adjust accordingly and possibly putting more,btohqsg
I agreed 150k can be quite a big amount. So 300k for a couple I see it is overkill. So I just pool the money together in a joint account. This is the family emergency fund.,btohqsg
Depend on what stage a pax is at. 150k actually not alot,btohqsg
So if my salary crediting is on 28th for example  i have 100k base  say salary of 3k  i must to transfer out 2500 by end of the month  so my balance show 100 500 on 1st of the following month to qualify?If i forgot to transfer out then my MAB = 103 000? And following month must have 103 500 and above to achieve the interest?,btohqsg
It can be one of the first goal post to aim for. Then with spare cash  they can look into investing for other sources of income. The important is you have a back door if anything happens,btohqsg
So basically if its a non business day (PH  saturday and sunday) it doesn‚Äôt count is it? Then following business day must add $500 more? Is that what you mean?,btohqsg
Maybe first you need to understand what is MAB?,btohqsg
Other than UOB one account  I use trust account as they don‚Äôt have tier interest rate. This will be my account where i can move funds in and out and yet it still earn decent returns. With up to 3% cover up to 500k. You have that flexibility.,btohqsg
If 1st is a public holiday  you need to add more than 500 since technically you have lesser days for the MAB to be 500,btohqsg
Depends on your time horizon on when you want to hit the milestone. For many  it‚Äôs hard to hit with purely employment income so investment is gonna come in place even before hitting 100K or more,btohqsg
Yap. We can use t-bills and FD to help to accelerate the saving process. The important is start early. My regret is I only learn all these  close to 50.,btohqsg
Called them  they say need wait 14 working days for new customer,btohqsg

I'm not sure what you mean included  but this 500 is debit/credit card spending,btohqsg
Meaning if i have set up 3 giro transaction and the total already exceed $500  on top of that i need to spend another $500 on my card?,btohqsg
I think you are confused. The giro has no minimum amount  iirc.The conditions for UOB One account is $500 spend on card + (3 GIRO OR 1.6k salary)I suggest you do the salary instead of the giro  since the salary gives higher interest rate,btohqsg
It‚Äôs two different criteria. Spending is a must for 500$  and either 3 giro or salary,btohqsg
Kindly refer to above TnC for what is eligible card spend for the $500,btohqsg

Hi all!  Got a question on HSBC 5.2% everyday global account promotion.  How to achieve 5.2%.  Based on website - 0.05 + 3.45 + 1 = 4.45%.  Where is additional 0.75% from??,btohqsg
No. You need to spend 6500 within 2 months to get desire reward points. This is worse than spending for dbs attitude card to get about 42k miles,btohqsg
I always have e impression Maldives=5 digit expenses (for two). Can only afford Bintan. If spend 6.5k and can save 10k quite good leh.,btohqsg
DBS points can transfer to Marriott Bonvoy?,btohqsg
Haha with opportunity cost loh missing out the high miles/high cashback card,btohqsg
Yup. Miles is still best value.But for AMEX  I find Bonvoy has the best value of 1 MR to 1 Bonvoy. Will get a lot less in miles.,btohqsg
I dont qualify for those high end amex card haha. Not atas enough to enjoy amex benefit. Lol,btohqsg

Reset month is to reset your MAB so you can satisfy the Save criteria again.,btohqsg
OP specifically state UOB One account. And there are data points that state from personal account with different name counts for OCBC 360 account.,btohqsg

You have $500 worth ofpostedtransaction inMay? Any refundspostedinMay? Anyineligibletransactions? What's your MAB?There's a 0.6% p.a. bonus interest even if you only hit spend criteria  so it's highly likely you failed to hit spend criteria.Unless your MAB is less than $4?,btohqsg
Easy way to confirm is go on your app and check your bonus interest history. They will tell you what level you have hit  how much is your clocked spending and salary crediting.,btohqsg

Hi guys  new to Miles. Would like to ask how the calculation of 1.25 CPM is derived. If 4MPD = 1M per 0.25D  wouldn't that make 25 Cents per mile?1.25 CPM is equivalent to $0.0125 which is much less than the $0.25 per mile. Am I misunderstanding something here?,btohqsg
4mpd means that you earn 4 miles per every dollar you spend on a purchase. Of course  you don't earn 1 dollar worth of miles for every dollar that you spend  which is the calculation that you made. Instead miles are worth much less than 1 dollar and this is based on your value of a mile (subjective for each individual). So 1.25 cpm here means the 4 miles that you earn per dollar are valued at 1.25 cents each = 5 cents total. This is equivalent value to 5% cashback.,btohqsg
hi  i just applied for singsaver‚Äôs citi premiermiles promo.im wondering if paying bills will qualify for the $500 spent?because in tnc it states ‚Äúbill payments made using the Eligible Card as a source of funds‚Äù  im unsure if this means paying utilities bill and phone bills can workand also  is there any way i can track how much of my spendings are qualified?,btohqsg
they say qualifying spend refers to any retail transactions which DO NOT arise from bill payments made using the card,btohqsg
ah my bad  did not read that part ü´†jumped the gun,btohqsg
I also recently applied for singsaver‚Äôs citi premiermiles promo. Still no news for my card application status,btohqsg

Hi  I have a question on Kris+ as I seldom use it for purchases. Can I use Google Pay + UOB PPV via Kris+ to clock 4mpd? Does this qualify ad contactless payment under UOB PPV? If no  then I'll just use G Pay + Amaze + CRMC. TIA,btohqsg
Another question. I plan to visit a restaurant that sells 10% discount vouchers in Kris+. The restaurant itself also offers 3 Kris+ points. Do I get Kris+ points for buying voucher? I don't think so but wish to confirm.Assuming there's a Mastercard promo in Kris+ ongoing (there isn't for now)  will voucher purchase meet the MC promo condition in Kris+?If I use $100 voucher to pay the restaurant bill of $150  i suppose I can still clock 3 Kris+ points when i use Kris+ app to pay the balance of $50  correct? TIA,btohqsg
Yes  you get whatever x mpd that the restaurant offers when you buy vouchers.Vouchers purchase qualify for MC promos.Yes  any balance paid after voucher offset still earns the x mpd.,btohqsg
Google pay + ppv on Kris+ will be online dining and qualifies for 4mpd. Online dining is in the whitelist for PPV.,btohqsg

I was overseas recently and had a meal charge that was reversed by the restaurant. It took about a day to show up. Although it was paid by Amaze  the refund will be made directly to the credit card that it is paired with. Since this was in a foreign currency  there was a difference of about 3%. I assume this is due to the unfavourable exchange rate on the bank's end.,btohqsg
Not many know if someone stores your contact. Change name to IamNotAnh also can see original name,btohqsg

Travel related purchases are excluded for CRMC‚Äôs 4mpd.,btohqsg
Uob KF cc seems best for 15k sgd tix. Or amex krisflyer ascend. Less miles but you can get KF elites gold for 1 year.Agoda booking can be paid via atome. Then use crmc to pay atome and clock 4mpd.,btohqsg

what do you think between UOB KF CC vs UOB PRVI Miles? cause i see that there's some cons for the UOB KF (Min SQ spend of $800/yearly + also bonus miles delayed by up to 14 months),btohqsg
UOB KF better. Spend on SQ flight will get u 3mpd right away without the wait.,btohqsg
u are already spending $15k so $800 is nothing. Furthermore  u get 3mpd the following month in your KF account. Lastly  u will get the KF Elite silver status the next membership year as well,btohqsg
But ya  can also consider amex Kris flyer ascend. It has welcome bonus and you can accelerate to KF elite gold  which is much better status,btohqsg

Honestly if HSBC EGA bonus interest rates promo continues to be at least 3.6% p.a. for the subsequent months  and you have any OCBC CC eligible for OCBC 360 account spend criteria  the best strategy is to salary credit to OCBC 360 account  and rotate your monies between these 2 accounts.

True  I haven‚Äôt applied for it yet.,btohqsg
Will definitely be better then bank 3.25 to 3.5 fee as that is their selling point haha,btohqsg
5.99% actually. But need to have $0 for 31 days before promo month to work and 150k. But that's based on Apr promo which may not return or return in a worse version.,btohqsg
6 leh melvyn based on 1000 earmark bonus for 150k for 4 month. 1k bonus is 2 percent.,btohqsg
"Oh wait I missed out the last ""half"" month.",btohqsg
U usually put whole month de mah to get the full 4 percent interest after earmark release ah haha,btohqsg
5.99% if you use the correct number of days,btohqsg

Hey Cyril  this is Khaled from Dobin  if you are referring to Best Card for Next Purchase  you can see all cards if you click on ‚ÄúShow More Cards‚Äù. If you are referring to Explore Cards  for now you can only compare 2 but we can add to our roadmap to see more,btohqsg
Question about EGA - possible for me to deposit non SGD Currency into the account assume I use a HSBC Machine and card overseas?,btohqsg
5.71% p.a.  (sorry 5.78% p.a.)We had worked it out.But you need an idle account (not even transferred out on 1st June),btohqsg
Taking part in the Plunging Chicken for $1000 gift for $150k  and locked for 4.5 months($1000 / 4.5 * 12) / 150 000 = 1.78% p.a.$150k MAB = 4% p.a.Total = 1.78 + 4 = 5.78% p.a.,btohqsg
i don't see why not.. because need to deposit on 1st July and locked till 15th November,btohqsg
U can always deposit on 31 jul to cut the duration lol,btohqsg

Reset month is the month u need to empty the acct as ocbc 360 required incremental 500 thus will reach a point where by the extra inside only get base interest,btohqsg
My apologies Melvyn but I am bad at calculations. Do you mean we should clear the account when we hit 103000 MAB please? I am not sure but I thought it is still worthwhile to continue to maintain rather than restart. Thank you.,btohqsg
I mean if first 100k gets like 300 plus interest  I thought losing interest on say 5k or not sure 10k is worth it,btohqsg
I probably need to calculate tomorrow,btohqsg
Im confused. So if link card to amaze. And use it as contactless payment via samsung pay for example. Do i still get the 4mpd?,btohqsg
what does stock cash coupon S$80 mean? we need to trade any Sg stock even for $1 then can claim that $80? or can use $80 to buy the stock? Thanks,btohqsg
use Amaze card (linked to citi rewards mastercard) for any form of payment will get 4mpd so long mcc is not excluded. Note the Amaze card can only add to google pay  not samsung pay nor apple pay.,btohqsg
So link to google pay is fine. Still 4 mpd,btohqsg
Means have to use it to buy stocks and will offset up to $10 per order x8 vouchers,btohqsg
HSBC Revo like Cb siaI spend on places that clearly give 10x points but the statement only give 1x pointsFor example  food places like seizeria  is 5812 but wasn‚Äôt given 10x points,btohqsg
I know  5812 not affected Ma,btohqsg
Rarely use after the nerrf bet get alternative cards,btohqsg
It‚Äôs too many sia  like previous month I spend almost 900 but only get 4k points‚Ä¶ abit sus lei,btohqsg
Go for citi. Abuse it til nerf,btohqsg
How to contact hsbc ah? Can go down to the bank? Cause if type in chat very hard to explain,btohqsg
Call up lor or just throw towel,btohqsg
Citi already nerfed supermarkets to 6% recently. Sad,btohqsg
So I‚Äôm not the only one experience this ah,btohqsg
Really?? Oh my didn‚Äôt check my rewards statement a/c‚Ä¶ considered to cancel n move on other cc then‚Ä¶ ü•≤,btohqsg
Already sropoo using it after revolution nerf & clear out points,btohqsg
Ikr. Now my go to are crcm+amaze > dbs wwmc > altitude,btohqsg
But I follow their term and condition very closely and check with heymax for the code lol.  Knn never expect to see the points so littleWas hoping about 9k back in points,btohqsg
Is altitude worth it tho? The only plus point I see about it is that the points dont expire.,btohqsg
Good for lounge access I guess. If u think not worth then don't get.,btohqsg
did u manage to get the American Tourister luggage?,btohqsg
Would dbs wwmc be better in this case? Hahaha just wondering cause my fiance is thinking if should cancel it.,btohqsg
Tbh no except for lounge access. I only may use it for hotel bookings (i compare whats the max point i can earn between altitude or wwmc) and public transport. Too lazy to get different card for orphan miles,btohqsg
Do u mean dbs altitude card?,btohqsg
Cuz wwmc is a good card tbh except its limited to online spending. If covers some offline spending ie  certain mcc  that would make a great card,btohqsg
GG there goes ur 10x points if eligible merchant,btohqsg

Question if existing cc under posb everyday card  does applying dbs altitude card consider as new application? If there‚Äôs any promo deal is considered as new customer right? Thx,btohqsg
You got face this issue too?,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt bother check but well it‚Äôs ain‚Äôt giving much points so far planning to move on other cc‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs say I want to terminate  should I terminate after I get the rewards from  singsaver?,btohqsg
doed anyone have the maybank evibes card?,btohqsg
Bonus point for May spending will only appear by this month end or next month July.,btohqsg
Same as existing hav Citi Cashback cc   n applying another Citi reward card also counted as existing customer ü•≤?,btohqsg
Do u have money inside IBKR?,btohqsg
But I only started spending in April and got 4000 points for spending 800-900  surely that includes bonus as well right,btohqsg
I would say fulfill the singsaver requirement and get ur gifts first  but do read the fine print just to be sure there‚Äôs any termination clause,btohqsg
so you are trying to fully spend your balance? then you cannot because you will still have to pay for currency exchange (if you have SGD) and brokerage fees etc,btohqsg
Some people did not receive bonus for April‚Äôs spending due to rewards system upgrade and was told that it will come in by June. You can call in and check.,btohqsg
Ok noted. So right now it‚Äôs best I just tele the points on excel and double check the points in later months?,btohqsg
when you try to place order  you can see a breakdown. what interface are you using?,btohqsg
How did you confirm that saizeriya is 5812?,btohqsg
You do know heymax is not entirely accurate right?,btohqsg
Actually I think some sai are classified as 5814.,btohqsg
Yeap but sai is a restaurant I think,btohqsg
Okay I got it already. Thank you~,btohqsg
You searched on Heymax or link your HSBC to the card maximizer?,btohqsg
@LPS1712click on this and it will give you total cost,btohqsg
Thank you I got it already. The interface not very friendly,btohqsg
Both  by searching will give the mcc code which I used to check in the term and condition Also heymax recommended revo since I have that card,btohqsg
that's true but the fills are great and the prices good,btohqsg
A restaurant can be coded as 5814 too. Some people mentioned they went for ramen and it turned out to be 5814https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/204111,btohqsg
Wa piang ehWhy don‚Äôt banks just publish the mcc code along side the statement,btohqsg
Maybe you can go work at a bank then implement itBut it could also be that your reward points haven‚Äôt been rewarded,btohqsg
That why i always like amaze with crmc now  mcc shown in app,btohqsg
Will look into that after cancelling revo,btohqsg
It‚Äôs for accountability issue. They don‚Äôt want to get blamed if the mcc code is given wrongly,btohqsg
Coz amaze ma  bank issued cards don‚Äôt think any of it shows,btohqsg
Link your HSBC card to the card maximiser in Heymax  it will show the MCC of your transactions.,btohqsg
Actually I dont understand why the need to cancel a card that gives 4mpd and no annual fee. It can always act as a backup when you burst your other cards max spend. Or just use it on platforms that confirm gives bonus pointsGiven that you don‚Äôt have over 100 cards,btohqsg
Because it doesn‚Äôt give the 10x points,btohqsg
I think the mcc is still based on what heymax shows  may not be accurate,btohqsg
You mean like actually verify my revo card on hey max?,btohqsg
That makes 0 sense but sure,btohqsg
It‚Äôs accurate. The transaction data is provided by Visa  after you have spent.,btohqsg
Read up above when I started the thread,btohqsg
Ya but you can use it on platforms that confirm gives you 10x points? I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt have other cards to use for dining since you‚Äôre using revo,btohqsg
Firstly  try to reconcile your base point for the eligible transactions.Eligible transaction exclude 5411 5814 and 4722 and 7011 that most people think it shall be included but exclude from 01 May onwards. Those are small food stall/fairprice/trip.com/agoda  Cold Storage  Starbucks  KFC  Sheng Siong  etc‚Ä¶Base point is calculated base on your spend on statement month using round down method per transaction.Eg. $1.3 earn 1 point.$1.8 earn 2 points.Check if your base point printed on statement correct or not.I use the above method  it works for my base point but I don‚Äôt have many transactions on my Revo card.,btohqsg
Then you can see details of your transactions like this,btohqsg
But is this mcc code based on heymax or based on the actual code of the organisation,btohqsg
Tally your base point first. Bonus point will come 1 or 2 months later.,btohqsg
So I need to pay via heymax?,btohqsg
No need  just link your card and spend. Each time a transaction is completed  it willshow up on Heymax.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs my confusion here too cause I only got my card in April and got around 4000+ pts on spend between 800-900This means that bonus points was included within the same statement month,btohqsg
You link then you will know. It is free service and auto get the data from Visa.,btohqsg
bonus points only come in end of next month ah,btohqsg
I guess the 4000+ points are your based points plus part of your bonus points. The rest of your bonus point will appear by end of this month June.If you want to reconcile Revo points  it is not an easy job.,btohqsg
For uobone card  is the sup card and main card on a separate monthly statement?,btohqsg
Points adjusted is your bonus points.,btohqsg
The points earned is inclusive of the bonus points or just the base,btohqsg
Yalo so I got it on the same statement month for April not next month,btohqsg
Ya. That is what I suspect part of your bonus points were credited.,btohqsg
Did you see miscellaneous - bonus under rewards on 28 May in the app? That would be bonus for April spending. If you don‚Äôt see  then maybe it‚Äôs delayed and should come in June.,btohqsg
Double check with month of May too. No miscellaneous,btohqsg
Just wait till end of June  then check again. Also  go and tally your transactions.,btohqsg
Overall revo is still reliable and consistent if spending of tech and gadget items right?,btohqsg
Tech and gadget from where? Ultimately the MCCs must fall in the whitelist.,btohqsg
Means you have bonus point for the $400 of eligible spending in Apr was  credited.,btohqsg
MCC 5732 still earns 4mpd for Revo.,btohqsg
as a student should i get a student credit card  or should i wait till im earning more and then get a proper one.,btohqsg
Ok will tally up and see if next month have anot . Thanks all for help and insight,btohqsg
Hi  question regarding citi payall. Does the service fee itself earn miles too?,btohqsg
Tbh  it really depends on yourself1) Will you overspend if you do have a credit card( since you won‚Äôt see the money in your bank going down like how a debit card works)2) let‚Äôs say you do spend recklessly till you hit the limit of card  do you have the means to pay it off without compromising?What I did is whenever I spend on my credit card  I xfer this amount to another bank account. So this helps me keep track of my spending and if really my bank account is depleted  I would still have the means to pay off my card bills.,btohqsg
ya that was my plan too  but i saw somewhere correct me if im wrong that if i apply for a student credit card in the future  ill miss out on ‚Äúfirst time credit card holder deals‚Äù when i eventually get a real one.,btohqsg
I think it is good to start with a student cc to know your spending habit as it tend to be low limit rather then in future when they gauge based on your income. A high cc limit mean u land into bigger trouble when u cant repay,btohqsg
It probably do  but when you start working  you can always cancel this student card and apply for a new one either under another bank or wait for a year to ‚Äúreset‚Äù since this student card probably have a low limit,btohqsg
Hello  can I ask: Which card should I use to pay my hotel in bangkok?HSBC -Revo  DBS altitude or Amex Krisflyer?,btohqsg
Check out what mcc the hotel is using? If its in exlusion  hsbc revo is out of question. Dbs altitude mayb better option cuz 2.2mpd vs 2mpd,btohqsg
Erm I have the card since 2019. It was some watch. But that one long thrown away  looks metallic but actually is cheap plastic haha,btohqsg
When you plan to put 150K back? 2nd July? I withdraw on 1st Jun,btohqsg
