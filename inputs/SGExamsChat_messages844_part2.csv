cause i think russia & china have their own localized & major social platforms,btohqsg
so citizens infiltrate the other social platforms out of boredom,btohqsg
through the help of VPN ‚ú®,btohqsg
their own VPNs works better within their nation  as compared to overseas VPN that tourists might be using when they go over LOL,btohqsg
though  usually it works only with a local telco number,btohqsg
heres another thing you may not know,btohqsg
Sgexams is among the top 10 for education reddit channels,btohqsg
LOL this was another weird fact that we all probably only realized some time later  and also don't even understand,btohqsg
personally speaking  i don't wanna bother trying to understand too many things that don't require my attention or assistance,btohqsg
VKontakte(more recognized as VK for short),btohqsg
ok  enough cursed reddit posts to show for today,btohqsg
reminds me of my time as a CP (couple-pairing) fangirl over a bunch of people who were usually involved with romantic allegations,btohqsg
and these very same people are normally the ones i interact with ü§°,btohqsg
wait  what's thatyou mean you just ship people or?,btohqsg
i still have a bunch of ship fanarts,btohqsg
^yall think this will be more expensive or less compared to the current private owners vehicle COE lol,btohqsg
it won't affect them  unless they use their own personal cars to do private-hailing jobs,btohqsg
ya but my opinion still stands,btohqsg
my dad did a grab private-hire driving job before,btohqsg
he struggled with handling his personal administrative work LOL,btohqsg
I mean this is a leading reason for private cars tho  so taking out these fleet entities from upbidding on actual private cars will impact the private car market in retrospect,btohqsg
ya but you gotta understand that there's probably a bunch of people misusing buying a private-hire use ONLY system,btohqsg
if a private hailing platform doesn't detect such abuse on the driver's part finding loopholes,btohqsg
but when it gets too problematic,btohqsg
that's where issues like a possible separate COE pricing plan gets brought up,btohqsg
i mean if every 3rd or 4th car you see on the road is a private hire car/taxi and not for personal use...thats problematic aint it,btohqsg
though drivers with private hire usage cars  often just trying to end up hiding the private hire sticker away,btohqsg
i noticed when taking newer private hires with things like TADA & gojek  early in the morning with my dad when i follow him to work,btohqsg
or like usually when i take private hire car,btohqsg
Total vehicles on our roads from 2013 to 2023,btohqsg
LOL  only the cars that are under private-hire registered are gradually increasing over the years,btohqsg
the rest are usually just fluctuating with barely no change  stagnant amount or a gradual decline,btohqsg
the shift is due to the taxi decreasing,btohqsg
surprised there are more lories or heavy vehicles than the rest,btohqsg
the range of flexibility and freedom were called benefits & bonus people considered to prefer  but it's not actually any different,btohqsg
in the long run  these very same flexibility & benefits will end up becoming more like standardized & regular with normal terms found in other jobs,btohqsg
"A substantial amount of logistics companies have a ""extra"" lot for their trucks",btohqsg
unless you consider those trailer trucks,btohqsg
coz that's usually registered as two,btohqsg
local logistics delivery services have trucks less than 10 trucks per office now,btohqsg
cause there's been a gradual decline of logistics companies located at actual spacious areas like industrial parks,btohqsg
for context  my father's full-time job had his logistics delivery company office moved from Defu Lane Industrial Park to an office around the Northeast Town Area ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
i mean looking at statistics  the two main truck brands ive seen on our roads Hino and Isuzu have not registered a new vehicle on our roads since 2014So its safe to say  there is alot alot of old workhorses still on our roads,btohqsg
??? does toyota heavy-weight vehicles not exist to you,btohqsg
those other two truck brands are so much more older as compared to brands like toyota  mitsubishi etc,btohqsg
even for the same box truck vehicles LOL,btohqsg
Toyota only has the atlas  maybe you could say mitsubishi,btohqsg
since they have the fuso  across various gens,btohqsg
eh but funny fact is that all trucks are considered heavy-weight in sg,btohqsg
even if it's categorized under as light  heavy & very heavy-weight,btohqsg
