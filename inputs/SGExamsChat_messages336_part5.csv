Hullo! EAE’ed into NP’s Business Studies  here are some tips!1. Make your write-up realAs much as you’d want to make your writeup & portfolio look amazing  it has to be you. When you get to the interview portion later  you’ll need to be able to communicate the same story you wrote down.2. Be assuredYou know yourself best  and you know why you chose the course. There isn’t any room to doubt what you’re sharing about yourself. In group interviews  also keep in mind that it isn’t a one-upping competition within the group.3. Present your alignment wellEmbrace the parts that make you unique. Be sure to highlight what makes you so special for the course  and what makes the course special to you.This is to do with relevancy & impact. ie. beyond school  you took up an apprenticeship in <insert industry here> So rather than focusing on your sec sch experience  tap into this unique thing that is more relevant to your course.4. Present yourself wellAbove all  be kind & polite. A warm greeting  small talk & good etiquette are simple things that are often overlooked.,btohqsg
I do know some people who EAEd into courses like In’t trade and logistics as well as nursing.,btohqsg

Yes. The write up gotta be convincing and also you appear enthusiastic during the interview phase. Also do some research on the course you are going for.,btohqsg
