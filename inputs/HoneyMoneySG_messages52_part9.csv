Is Fullerton USD cash fund good buy?üëç,btohqsg
IMO exchange rate is not favourable now,btohqsg
If u enter on a high now and usd drop in the future.... Ur earnings could be affected significantly,btohqsg
People speculate that FED might increase rates again this year. If they do USD likely will strengthen. But If they sudden decide not to  it will devalue against SGD alittle.,btohqsg
Yes theres another 2 small hike coming as per jerome powell said in the congress.... But SGD usually reacts accordingly to maintain the balance,btohqsg
But i have to say ever since i entered into the cash fund since april  the 7 days yield has been mostly above 5%,btohqsg
The only deterrant frm my putting in more money is the forex.... Somemore webull's forex spread quite lousy,btohqsg
No lah. Someone help to explain to me that my fx rate loss is only 0.005*550 by changing money with them. They earn my business but they lose my trust,btohqsg
I only change money with moneychangers who show the forex board publicly,btohqsg

Can we get cash back if we spend the hospital/medical bill using Citi cash back plus?,btohqsg
Just wanna share with you on Amaze/Youtrip/UOB ladies cardWent to JB on a Sunday yesterday these are the rates I got from spending using various cards:Youtrip: 3.423Amaze:  3.363UOB:      3.428JB Money Changer: 3.42Amaze rate sucks but if you spend sgd2k worth you get 2000 points which you can change to SGD20 in cash in the wallet.But the difference between Amaze and UOB in SGD2k of spending is RM130 or   SGD38 if you use money changer rate.Conclusion is you are better off using UOB than Amaze cos you save more (SGD38) than what Amaze can reward you (SGD20) for using their card on a SGD2k spend.I‚Äôm truly surprised by how good UOB ex rate is and in this case it‚Äôs even better than Youtrip.What are your FX rates experience using other bank credit cards?NB: need to clarify now that after the UOB transaction is posted with the FX fee  the rate is 3.321. It‚Äôs worse off than Amaze. So conclusion should be that Amaze is still the card to go to stack on your MC for overseas transactions.,btohqsg
you didn't add in the reward received from the linked Mastercard to Amaze.,btohqsg
UOB as in SG UOB credit card ? There is no additional FX fees?,btohqsg
There will be a 3.5% FX fees not?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure about that. I‚Äôm just using actual conversion rates that was charged to compare.,btohqsg
need to include all fees and rewards for a fair comparison,btohqsg
should use Amaze+uob ladies instead. uob credit card incur 3.25% fx fee  higher than Amaze (mark up of about 1.8% less the 1% instarem rebate),btohqsg
With the FX fees on UOB  YouTrip's rate would be much better. If done comparison for 1:1.,btohqsg
Any good FC deals for july?,btohqsg
So is it better now to pair uob lady card with amaze now ?Compare to Citi reward master card,btohqsg
Why is it a choice? Amaze can pair with up to 5 Mastercards,btohqsg
yes if mcc is under the selected category for 6mpd  amaze+crmc still good for other mcc (except travel and other exclusions),btohqsg
next time try use trust card and compare!,btohqsg
Then how come my actual rates show Amaze is much worse?,btohqsg
Nice experiment  but have you watched this?https://youtu.be/y-yHZas1amM,btohqsg
uob transaction not yet posted? can see if the 3.25% is included after posted,btohqsg
I can see the transaction. Status is pending. I spend RM18. The Sgd charged is $5.25. So the rate is 3.428.,btohqsg
For UOB  you have to wait for the txn to be posted after a few days to factor in the actual fx fees. U can take a screenshot and compare a few days later after it‚Äôs posted; usually +3.25% fees,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see any yet. Ok I will monitor when it is posted. Thanks.,btohqsg
Are your data points at the exact same time? Or different times throughout the day?,btohqsg
The rates you see on Amaze alr includes the 2.5% fx fee. Your UOB transaction will either include the fx fees later  or the fx fees will appear as a separate charge.,btohqsg
the UOB lady card  if take bus/mrt does it award the 6mpd?,btohqsg
You can use trust card. The FX rate will be better.,btohqsg
"https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/ladys-cards-tcs.pdf?s_cid=grm:sg:paid:sea:go:na:tx:na:001812:160223-evergreen:bau&vid=MindshareSGYes  pg 9  SimplyGo under Transport category 4111But you need to enrol in ""Transport"" for that quarter",btohqsg
Uob lady is depend on what cat u enrol for the quarter  only selected catergory have 6mpd,btohqsg
Yea. Transport is one of those that is hard to earn rewards..,btohqsg
Shouldn‚Äôt the interest be 416 if you maxed out everything at 100k,btohqsg
Mastercard will accumulate the transactions for simplygo. Something like $10 or 5 days whichever comes first,btohqsg
Do anybody know Legoland is under travel?,btohqsg
Correct  ok bah  cos Master card under simply Go  they consolidate and charge per week. visa is charged daily,btohqsg
actually uob lady bonus 3.6mpd and 2mpd is based on cumulated spend in the month rounded down to nearest $5  not $5 block per transaction,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs different from other UOB card,btohqsg
different from ppv and prvi  similar to visa signature,btohqsg
Yolo is the old name of Evol.,btohqsg
