If applying as single  must add 15k to the selling price~,btohqsg
Ohhh  when was your BTO exercise?,btohqsg
Curious if it will be practical to compare with Tampines prices?There is Tampines offered in the current June BTO exerciseBut in October will be Standard / Plus / Prime model,btohqsg
Ohhh  congrats! Flat selection is the most important  in my opinionSecond appointment can waitJust let CPF money continue to grow in the meantimeMy second appointment was slightly more than a year after my flat selection,btohqsg
Get married and the 15k comes back... üòÇ,btohqsg
Also come with 10 years MOP~,btohqsg
Oh yah  i think the 15k come back also got conditions oneLike  must be SC spouse?,btohqsg
I think one of the forms has something about it,btohqsg
ü´¢Watch the world burnBut is it parents totally cannot move or still can move but must be within a certain radius?,btohqsg
must be within 4km of the BTo,btohqsg
I find that Tampines and Bedok are near but can't tell how similar or different they are... üòÖ,btohqsg
Wow Tampines oversubbed af liao haha,btohqsg
Normally application results/signing of lease comes after how long post-launch?,btohqsg
Application results: can estimate 2-3 months to be safe. HDB will inform via email on the month of results release sometime after launch closesSigning of lease: depends when you pick your flat...it will be months after flat selection. HLE time  HDB estimated 6-9 months after flat selection  but HFE might be faster as HFE front loads the grant eligibility checking process.I'm not sure if any HFE people have signed lease yet. If any under HFE and alr signed lease  can share their anecdotal timeline :),btohqsg
Can I ask when hdb says 3 years 1 month waiting time  does it mean 3 years 1 month from launch date or from the day piling starts?,btohqsg
In the project you wantClick on the ? Next to est waiting timeAll date for the stage are shown,btohqsg
6-9 months period are what was told by hdb officer as wellBased on what happens in other groupsCan prepare for 1 yearEx: Jun 2024 BTO its second appointment can be on June 2025 period,btohqsg
Hello all   seeking for clarification for this above news ! To clarify is it we are only able to get the grants if we provide both of our payslip of over 12 months ? As I only work less then 12 months is it means we are not able to get the grants ?,btohqsg
DPD is the cover ass date  as beyond that they will have to compensatecan assume ECD to be more accurate  barring any complications or delays,btohqsg
The COVID ones yep  but I'm not too sure about the compensation amount. There were news articles about it if you're looking for details,btohqsg
You should be looking from ECD instead. Think of min and max date. It may be long for you but hoping that the BTO project don't fall into such problems ü•≤,btohqsg
Hi all can I ask if I can apply bto while waiting for HFE approval?,btohqsg
I remember reading from Housing minister Desmond Lee that Hdb have managed to clear 75% of delayed housing from Covid period,btohqsg
Ohh alright thank for the info appreciate it üôè,btohqsg
When did you apply for your HFE?If before the recommended date of 15 May  call HDB and askBut BTO application system wise  no idea whether applicant without valid HFE can still proceed or not,btohqsg
"Do thoseCall HDB and askTry login to system see if it block you from applyingAt most end results are:blocked you can't applyingApply but result comes back "" invalid application""""No Q number""""Have Q number""",btohqsg
Just jump in to the pool it swim or sink,btohqsg
The system is straightforward. No HFE  you cannot apply for a house. It's there for a reason. Not fair that they are restrictive towards resale process but not BTO üò™During this period  the hotline will be busy AF. Customer service is very busy. I suggest to eFeedback them now. Idk when you applied but HDB keep emphasize to apply 1 month in advance for sales launch.,btohqsg
Problem is  seems that there were people who applied according to HDB's recommendation because they intend to participate in the June launch but have yet to receive approval for their HFECan't really fault the applicants in this sense,btohqsg
Hi . I just made an BtO application . Only later I read and realised I could select two location with 1st and 2nd preferences.. am I right ? If yes. How do I amend my order ? Or I have to resubmit again ?,btohqsg
I would like have to apply for two different estate like Tampinese or Kallang,btohqsg
So I have to cancel my first application to apply for the one I decided now,btohqsg
Or simply submit another one the first will be cancelled ??,btohqsg
If you try reapplying without cancelling  they probably will tell you that you have an existing application,btohqsg
Hi guys can I check for application rates  as long as it‚Äôs below one it means that you will confirm get a flat right? Even if let‚Äôs say first timer is under one and second time is above one?,btohqsg
Yes2.0 = 2 people going for 1 flatWait until 25 June for a much closer rate and decided which project meet your requirements,btohqsg
200 units only sure oversubscribed one,btohqsg
Most applicants go for Tanjong RhuBut highest application rate is Tampines and Holland,btohqsg
The final application rate for the previous Tampines BTO  just sharing for fun,btohqsg
Crazy. 14 people fight for 1 flat,btohqsg
Got crazier one. Kovan last time 18:1 unit üòÖ,btohqsg
Ya hahaha now like anything above 10 is quite crazy due to the restrictions,btohqsg
Oh yeah definitely! All open for singles,btohqsg
East side is tough  there is practically no non-mature estates in the East but they also expect us to stay near our parents ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Surprisingly more second timer applying for flat compared to first timer,btohqsg
Due to new rules those who give up are second timer for 1 year,btohqsg
Good luck for second timer this time round,btohqsg
BTO 2022 tampines 5R application rate 18.5 ü§£But most sad is bukit merah  7916 applicants fight for 1298 units. More than 6500 families won‚Äôt be able choose a flatThe number of applicants back then ü•≤,btohqsg
Because many jus tikam and try for fun‚Ä¶ until Hdb Implemented the new rules‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Ya lo after new ruleFeb bto 2024 total applicants only 10 k applicantsLast time one bukit merah site 4R already almost 8 k applicants liao,btohqsg
