Do update when it comes in! I jus made my transaction today,btohqsg
I mean for Singsaver EGA promo requirements  not the standard EGA monthly maintenance,btohqsg
then should get 4mpd unless they process offline or not under hotel MCC,btohqsg
hihi  if I use HSBC as my EZ-link card  the amount spend is counted towards the $800 min spend? thanks,btohqsg
The 5k fresh funds can‚Äôt withdraw? So must keep 10k inside got 2 mths?,btohqsg
Wanted to ask this too  after deposit can withdraw? or must leave the funds inside?,btohqsg
Confirmed eligible. EGA never cares about cc situation,btohqsg
Or just need to show the transaction?,btohqsg
Awesome. Thanks for the clarification üëç,btohqsg
Another qn is the interest rate. I tink won‚Äôt be good?,btohqsg
Yeah since ega only gives u limited interest for ‚Äútop up‚Äù amount instead of balance. My understanding is one time only for existing amount.,btohqsg
But the 350 more than enough to cover lol,btohqsg
That need to be done by when?,btohqsg
This tnc really not clear enough‚Ä¶,btohqsg
If pay phone bill via hsbc revolution have 4miles per dollar?,btohqsg
SimplyGo actually earns you 1x reward points on HSBC Revo. Effectively 0.4MPD. Called in to their cs support desk to check the other day.,btohqsg
So if I use SimplyGo can or cannot ah?,btohqsg
Whether or not it is counted as qualifying spend remains a mystery,btohqsg
Can use for simplygo. But might not be counted as qualifying spend.,btohqsg
Btw the $800 is started from the day you get your physical card or digital card,btohqsg
Can use but only basic 1x point/0.4 mpd. Not eligible for bonus 9x points as simplygo mcc is 4111 not whitelisted,btohqsg
The concern now is more of whether simplygo transactions can be counted in the $800 singsaver spending requirements,btohqsg
Ic ic‚Ä¶ need to check. My revo cc was via official site. 200 cash back upon 500 spend. According to that tnc  the 500 spending only excludes those common government/insurance/axs etc. not as strict as its whitelisted 10x mcc categories.,btohqsg
Does SimplyGo transaction count as contactless payment?,btohqsg
Some cards count SimplyGo as contactless  some don't. It's all very confusing.Cards that count:- DBS Live Fresh- UOB EVOL- OCBC FRANKCards that don't count:- UOB PPV- UOB VS- HSBC Revo (not in MCC whitelist),btohqsg
sry my mistake  I think seems like Simplygo not excluded from the $800 qualifying spend,btohqsg
can‚Äôt confirm unless u call HSBC  but if u see their TnC in the picture   don‚Äôt see how it falls under these exceptions,btohqsg
HSBC revo stated that for simply go you only get 1x rewards aka 0.4mpd,btohqsg
iirc LiveFresh is because simplygo is considered under green lifestyle hence,btohqsg
It counts as both. So 10% cashback,btohqsg
Hi All  I would like to check if I use amaze card to pay my private hailing services (eg. TADA  GoJek  RYDE) what is the transaction will be appearing in my credit card bill?,btohqsg
Notice if you applied the credit card and your try to apply for the ega promo  the website will say you have an existing relationship with them‚Ä¶maybe anyone can confirm this?,btohqsg
So the individual bank for that credit card will count that transaction as online payment or category?,btohqsg
You will earn rewards for:- online spending- MCC specific categoriesYou won't earn rewards for:- merchant specific categoriesExample: if the T&Cs state specifically state that you will earn rewards for Grab  then routing through amaze will earn you nothing.,btohqsg
Most retail dont allow krispay to be use to buy voucher,btohqsg
Update: assumption is WRONG. EGA requires both accounts/cc new user. Existing CC holders not eligible for SingSaver EGA promo.,btohqsg
hello all  for those who have the amex blue krisflyer card  how quickly does the miles transfer over to your krisflyer acc? thanks!,btohqsg

Mine gets transferred at the start of each month.,btohqsg
