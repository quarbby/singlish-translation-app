Hello does anyone know if UOB Lady Solitaire card 2nd year onwards able to waive fees?,btohqsg
Yes but depend on individual spending profile,btohqsg
Ok thanks! and does anyone know if Citi Prestige card is worth renewing for ($545 for 25k miles)? I signed up last year cause the sign up bonus was pretty good.I‚Äôm someone who travels quite often  almost any other month. So the lounge access is pretty useful for me.If renewing the Citi Prestige is not a good deal  any other cards to recommend?ü§£,btohqsg
Citi card is worth it for the citi payall if u have usage for it. If not can just keep jumping ard. Uob vi is 645 af and give 40k miles for exisiting customer and 80k for new customer if u can spend 4k in 30days,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I have a question about using the Maybank Family & Friends Card with the Amaze Card for Malaysia spending.If I pay at a furniture store in Malaysia (MCC 5712) using Amaze linked to my Maybank F&F card  will the transaction still qualify for the 8% cashback under the Malaysia spending category? I‚Äôm concerned because Amaze converts MYR to SGD  so I‚Äôm not sure if it will still count as Malaysia spending.Would appreciate any insights or experiences with this. Thanks!,btohqsg
Ok will have a look at that! maybe consider Vantage too. But the 4k spend in 30 days might be tough for me to hit as spending is pretty low ü´†,btohqsg
Dbs vantage also 4k spending  but upon payment of annual gfee u get 25k miles  extra 15k when u hit 4k. But uob have many priority access to concert which is more useful for me haha,btohqsg
Need to use card directly to charge in myr,btohqsg
Vantage only 10 pp while vi is unlimited dragon with 1 guest,btohqsg
That particular category in local spend already hit? If not it will take up the local spend quota first.,btohqsg
I see! ok i will compare renewing Citi Prestige vs UOB VI. Thanks so much üòÅ,btohqsg
1. Yes  5k miles is for new to UOB KF offer.,btohqsg
But recently we got $500 for Ma  so only $3500 for Jan 2025,btohqsg
I think furniture mcc doesnt fall under any of the selected category,btohqsg
Other spend is a category unfortunately lol,btohqsg
25k miles is about 375$ (at 1.5cpm).You travel often. Id consider the ability to have meal then relax at the lounge is a big bonus. (And unlimited +1)And if your payall can hit limo req  545$ is already paid for itself.,btohqsg
I have no issue with Kris+ refund   but not travel company,btohqsg
Only time will tell if cpf will activate the transfer to SA/OA,btohqsg
Dun pair with amaze if want to be under MYR category  cause Amaze convert to SGD  pay with maybank family and friend directly and pay in MYR.,btohqsg
$500 is this year or next year? New BHS only in effect next year. So why do you take $500 off for next year?,btohqsg
This year max is 71500  next year max is 75500  but now is 72000  unless they will move the $500 out to SA,btohqsg
It's likely going to be treated like MA interest  31 Dec they will put in MA  and move to SA or OA (if SA hits FRS) on 1 Jan.,btohqsg
Hi guys  checking if favepay and shopback pay or applepay use Uob one card to pay  does it qualify for the base 3.33 % cashback spend?,btohqsg
But vantage comes with accorplus.. UOB VI other benefits quite sad,btohqsg
Hi for tax income on cpf self contrribution  what happen if self contribution exceed thr cpf annual limit? Am i still elogible of tax income reduction?,btohqsg
Assuming self-employed  your excess CPF contribution will be returned to you with no interest and no tax reliefs will be given on the monies returned.,btohqsg
Thanks. Any work around like transfer OA to SA?,btohqsg
If you are talkng about RSTU/VCMA  it's a separate limit from CPF salary ceiling of $102 000 ($37 740),btohqsg
Usually yes  unless under excluded MCC,btohqsg
Hi all  is the Christmas bonus cash reward from Sing saver still ongoing ?,btohqsg
Hi all  I understand that there is a nerf recently on the 4% SC credit card. May anyone recommend the next best CC for transport with no min. spend? thanks!,btohqsg
Hello  can I ask if I use the Citi reward cc pair with amaze card  then pay with amaze card. Then have a refund for my purchase  will it reflect on the Citi bank ? How does it work,btohqsg
can be refund to amaze wallet  linked card to Amaze or citi rewards card,btohqsg
so in my Citi bank statement I‚Äôll still need to pay the amount?,btohqsg
generally if a refund is credited back  it will be reflected as green positive amount. usually  no need to pay.but  please double check with the CSO.,btohqsg
Have. Those 1.3% cashback and below one have cashback.,btohqsg
If it's domestic spend  your amaze domestic spend quota will be eaten also.,btohqsg
yep purchased in ikea  but now need to do the refund  wondering should refund through amaze card or citi reward cc,btohqsg
Just postulating. UOB Lady‚Äôs savings account joint account. Put $10k in and couple with 2 lady‚Äôs card each benefiting for an additional 2mpd?,btohqsg
I might be wrong but only primary account holder will benefit. Same as most other joint account + card benefits.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm taking a stroll with my wife now and suddenly thought of it haha. Hoping somebody has experience and can advice üòäI‚Äôll try to do some searches tomorrow on this.,btohqsg
Thanks alot for confirming on SCBIf citi waived annual fee do trigger giro then will be a problemThen i need to cancel giro on inactive citi cards or another way is request for refund? Do you do this too? Thanksüôè,btohqsg
Citi can allow transfer out of excess credit into your active card.,btohqsg
If you have a Citi bank account  you can ask them to transfer the excess to it or to another active card. I do not recommend asking them to do a cheque payment back to you as it will incur cost of about $2-3 for banks to process that cheque,btohqsg
I think nowadays got PayNow method. UOB retuned me excess through PayNow.,btohqsg
Stupid Citibank. They did this to me on my CRMC renewal and insist that I either transfer the amount to another card or they give me a cheque. I get EGA giro cash back so I didn‚Äôt want them to transfer to another card üòëEdit. I made a mistake on the card. Prestige strictly no waiver üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi All  anybody knows any problem using Tiger/ moo moo app in China without VPN?,btohqsg
No problem. Only *selected* US apps have problem,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt recall any issue using interactive brokers in China. Was on FlexiRoam and hotel wifi. Both ok.,btohqsg
Maybe subscribe to cmlink. I see hardwarezone this is more good solution. I going to China this Jan too.,btohqsg
