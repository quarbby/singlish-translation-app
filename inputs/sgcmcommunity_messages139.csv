and not only that  you can really question the tyres fitted on these cars.,btohqsg
#loanfreelife(or as close to it as possible) best. Huge Loans for annually massively depreciating assets are such a bad idea.,btohqsg
oh im paying about 50% downpayment,btohqsg
50% down attracts no interest costs from loans  but what is the cost of that 50%? 😬,btohqsg
Hahaa haiyah no economic argument for buying car in sg one. It’s a want.,btohqsg
Happy and comfortable with payments can already!,btohqsg
:( my car payment 80% of my pay,btohqsg
The $30-40k put in has a chance of earning 10% somewhere but now it is losing for sure.,btohqsg
If add cost of average car  means $12k to be correct? Wow Singaporean average income is so high!!!!!,btohqsg
depending on what car you buy lor.,btohqsg
Average car only I think like Camry max,btohqsg
Camry Premium car cat B bro,btohqsg
iirc i think the sporty car that is still in Cat A COE is Mazda Miata ND 1.5L  still wtihin 130PS iirc,btohqsg
I think cannot calculate like that 1,btohqsg
https://s.lazada.sg/s.b4LpuAIYA BUY THIS LA. NO NEED ROAD TAX NO NEED COE and sure a lot of attention from pedestrians.,btohqsg
Even kid cars so exp nowadays,btohqsg
Get your car interior revamped at these upholstery workshops in Singapore 👑There are many reasons why one would consider changing their car's upholstery. These include giving the car a fresh look  increasing the resale price of the car  wanting increased comfort  or to replace existing damaged upholstery.While there may be many reasons  knowing which workshops to visit is essential. Here are some recommended upholstery workshops in Singapore to consider!➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
Like sounds logical leh. Then how ah? My maths not very good one haha,btohqsg
if u can tahan a 12k depre,btohqsg
means ur income needs to be about x 5 alr,btohqsg
cus ur losing 12k per year,btohqsg
Some people they save and scrimp till they have x amount then buy the  car .,btohqsg
Because they doesn’t want to have too much liability when buying at earlier stage .,btohqsg
i wud say my quality of life gotten worse after i buy car,btohqsg
dk is that good or bad,btohqsg
This morning   I was travelling on cte at 2 plus in the early morning   I spotted a few TP stopping vehicle at different section .,btohqsg
It’s good!!!! Quality of life improve coz healthier!!!,btohqsg
i dun believe in saving nowadays,btohqsg
eg u save $500 every month,btohqsg
at the end of the year  ur 6k become 5.5k or 5k,btohqsg
invest is the way to go,btohqsg
throw in 5k  let it roll.,btohqsg
But the return are very slow these days,btohqsg
yea now buy condo and rent out is a better financial choice,btohqsg
Bro u do investment is for 10 yr 15 yr 20 yr plan de,btohqsg
I hope you don’t mean 5k per month and let the car roll sir 😬😬,btohqsg
Invest in your mental health! Buy a shitbox,btohqsg

Do you leave your engine off during car wash?,btohqsg

Try put car in N or P lo,btohqsg
Noted  my friend keep nagging me that very dirty y nv wash,btohqsg
Morning back home realise the car really dirty,btohqsg
10% really low leh  unless you down payment a lot  imagine if you buy a Mazda 3 but gotta earn like 9k+ per month,btohqsg
But i didnt wash cus rain and gna handover le,btohqsg
Today need clear items out from car liao😂,btohqsg
Put in my car first later lor,btohqsg
Mine is I receive in Feb till now nv wash,btohqsg
Ppi heck care let them dig thru my shit,btohqsg
Yea that's what financial experts say and what's wrong earning 9k to drive mazda 3. That's only cause our coe perverted it 🫠🫠,btohqsg
I remember I when I had to handover my car at AML  carry a lot of stuff back by hand  had to buy plastic bag from the mini coffee shop. Totally no grab at that area damn sad,btohqsg
Mazda 3 is really nice no?,btohqsg
I had to carry 4 plastic bag + 1 backpack take MRT lmaooo,btohqsg
All the soft toy in my hand I paiseh,btohqsg
Yea the newer one  too bad the interior tech is still Japanese standard,btohqsg
If got like conti standard interior for extra $$ I wouldn’t mind buying a Mazda 3,btohqsg
Any higher our coe  myvi may one day become our luxury. Or it alr is. 🥹🥹,btohqsg
Nothing wrong  but for 9k a month I would treat myself to a BMW 2 series at the very leastFor me I willing to fork 25% of my salary to car installment,btohqsg
Having a car or even a MOTORBIKE is a luxury already sia,btohqsg
If you can afford a Myvi in Singapore  you can afford a nice luxury/sports car in US,btohqsg
Harlo a toyota here is a porche in US,btohqsg
And then in US ppl are like complaining about their monthly installment 🤦🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
Becoz mostly live paycheck to paycheck.,btohqsg
39k USD is considered expensive alr for a car.,btohqsg
(39k is the price of a Tesla Model 3 now btw),btohqsg
Whereas 39k is 1/3 of our COE paper  and some people have car while living paycheck to paycheck,btohqsg
My friend also funny  bought a Maserati but leftover is barely enough to survive the month HAHA,btohqsg
Already based in the current coe,btohqsg
That's why all buy to impress only. Quality of life also compromise. One thing that's ever gonna stop us is contentment.,btohqsg
I mean u can buy a car,btohqsg
But honestly i understand why some ppp buu a car,btohqsg
In here for a good time not a long time,btohqsg
I dun really wanna save save save but i miss out on my quality of living sia sometimes,btohqsg

Had to sleep in the car,btohqsg
Aiya argument with my wife is a daily thing,btohqsg
Go 小三house sleep lor   I think many brothers do that,btohqsg
2 nights ago was because she say she’s happy with what she’s earning right now and don’t want to be promoted and have more responsibilities,btohqsg
I told her I not going let her leech off me  she can pay for her own food and bills if she think her pay is high enoughI didn’t work my buuutt off for her to get all the benefits,btohqsg
I don’t mind leh truthfully speaking,btohqsg
I rather re-marry someone whose ambitious in career and have the same earning power as me (eg my colleague),btohqsg
That's how yall lift each other up to next level right,btohqsg

1 yr 10 month the car term damn short,btohqsg
And i full cash top up a few K only,btohqsg
I thought like car more than five years,btohqsg
1 year 10 month I also dk can get loan anot 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Hoping coe drop then I immediately,btohqsg
My profit from this car is unrealised gains,btohqsg
So X profit + my own money = car price,btohqsg
I bought at like 7k depre,btohqsg
Sold at 7.5k depre for 8 months usage,btohqsg
My depre is Cost price - Selling price,btohqsg
Wah don’t give me math please,btohqsg

I will sell to dealer  let them earn the money while I have fuss free experience,btohqsg
So long as 10k within range I’ll just let them bah,btohqsg
Even 5k is alot to me,btohqsg
You wanna drive around and take time out of your day to meet “potential” buyer meh,btohqsg
Sometimes those buyer will low ball also,btohqsg
Me just wanna sell car and change car immediately without the hassle,btohqsg
But for me  personally  I wouldn’t mind to earn the extra few k,btohqsg
Anyway I decided if I wanna lower I’ll just get lowering springs,btohqsg
I need someone to fact check but isn’t lowering springs more jialat the drive,btohqsg
Somemore can adjust to your likijg,btohqsg
Go for bilstein b12 or b14. Comfy yet firm.,btohqsg
I'm looking for catalytic converter for a jeep,btohqsg
A little bit harsher than stock but quite ok la  not super jia lat. I never heard coilovers so can't make a comparison myself either,btohqsg
But yes  lowering springs cannot be adjusted unlike coilovers and cannot achieve a lower stance. Once fitted  what you see is what you get hahaha,btohqsg
Then no choice if that’s the case gotta save for coilover lo,btohqsg
The adjustable ones will cost more,btohqsg
Why need to top up if full cash,btohqsg
Bilstein more reputable and chances of leak is quite low.,btohqsg
So I top up abit from my own savings lo,btohqsg
even BCV1 can adjust height / hardness of shock ba..,btohqsg
I remember that time i ask,btohqsg
the only one i know is bilstein B12 which is a combi of B8 shocks + eibach lowering spring,btohqsg
Don’t adjustable only give you… 1 way nia,btohqsg
anyway i did eibach lowering spring before coilovers,btohqsg
But iirc  all coilovers can adjust ride height,btohqsg
wont be uncomfortable.. the problem i face was.. nt low enuff,btohqsg
But yah in the end I didnt do coilover,btohqsg
Then I just sua nvm dont need coilover cus i sat in one. And nearly puked,btohqsg
By the way@historyofmanend up I gonna paint my car 😭,btohqsg
asian brands easier. conti.. mostly cant add i tink,btohqsg
I have sat in one coilover. So firm yet comfortable.,btohqsg
Adjusted too firm or not cornerweighed properly 😉,btohqsg
I TOLD U TO STOP ALT,btohqsg
Think got anywhere cheaper to paint anot ah (4670),btohqsg
Cannot la I already preorder the body kit  the thing is he say bodykit only 3.2  with paint in and out 7.9 total,btohqsg
Start off in middle settings then go up to track stiffness or street,btohqsg
I might get coilover from my colleague   he’s selling his Audi A6 soon then maybe can buy from him,btohqsg
Coilovers are heaven if adjusted correctly,btohqsg
You need to check if the model can fit your ride,btohqsg
Hopefully Lor if can   I can probably get it cheap,btohqsg
How long he had it? Please check mountings etc all come together plus adjustable end links if needed,btohqsg
He’s A6 only 3 years old,btohqsg
Also if you worry about ride height  why not bags 🫣🫣🫣🫣🫣,btohqsg
I wouldn’t take used coilovers or BBKs unless you really know full history,btohqsg
So roughly should be 1 year+ alr,btohqsg
Cuz I remember he start to zhng after the second year,btohqsg
Not worried about height  I want comfy ride,btohqsg
I also don’t need to have it so ridiculously low,btohqsg
But no choice ah  if all brand new then I gotta be spending 20k+ within a month  excluding my 9k spending this month,btohqsg
Once you lower  you compromise on comfort already. Have you sat in your friend's A6 before? Good to try it out and see if you really like it!,btohqsg
I drove it before  feels like I can feel all the humps and stuff,btohqsg
My friend got coilovers and disliked it and got them removed after a week  waste money,btohqsg
But then y’all say my wheel gap big,btohqsg
On 1 hand I don’t like coiloverOn the other hand  a lot of people say my A4 ugly gap I sad liao,btohqsg
End of the day it's your car la  dont care what people say. No point you lower to look good but hate the ride when you drive,btohqsg
Dont need care what others say,btohqsg
I kena call suv before i also okay,btohqsg
Then I laugh at them Eh my car dont leak OIL LEH,btohqsg
Then i say I ONE FULL TANK CAN GO PENANG LEH,btohqsg
You can do research between coilovers and lowering springs and see  perhaps lowering springs may be more suited to your preference. From my understanding  lowering springs are not as harsh as coilovers BUT also depends on how well the coilovers are adjusted to fit your ride. Having said that  you also gotta find good lowering springs. Some cheap ones are crap and may wear your suspension too,btohqsg
If expensive but good quality smooth ride I won’t mind spending 2-3k for spring ah,btohqsg
“Your ride your vibe” - some m3 owner,btohqsg
Do your bodykit first then see how la  slowly modify throughout the year also fun mah,btohqsg
Same I'm on this set up  it's good.,btohqsg
Haha true ah  but sometimes hand itchy,btohqsg
atas product of cuz good haha. i just find eibach prokit nt low enuff so sold it,btohqsg
Install bodykit might scrape the kit,btohqsg
Ur kit comes in no color,btohqsg
Yeah  then need to adjust the coilovers again,btohqsg
Then maybe nee wheels to match new body kit,btohqsg
Swee I go ask them for quote,btohqsg
2 fingers alr wor. Anywhere lower no gap to bounce alr 🫠🫠,btohqsg
Btw I see some ads on “5 Stage Nano ionization” or what can improve FC  isit snake oil,btohqsg

Just say got a direct owner willing to nego  this one dowan liao,btohqsg
Anyway if they still wanna firm  just don't give them the business,btohqsg
This kind of dealer don't deserve our money,btohqsg
Based on my tiny car buying experience  If the car is legit good  they won't give a discount.,btohqsg
Ahh why leh? I also not sure,btohqsg
No paint as in they won’t paint whole car la  but the bodykit will match my colour,btohqsg
Why people so salty over a loaner media vehicle? It was loaned to her to try and shoot content and give back,btohqsg
I plan to go back 2 weeks later lo,btohqsg
The same way you think they can sell for lower price to you then,btohqsg
They know you desperate if you go back after so long,btohqsg
Plus most bigger name dealers don't care if they hold a car for longer  especially a low capital car like golf,btohqsg
Not too much tied up in it,btohqsg
So they don't lower too much,btohqsg
But wa im prepared to down alr,btohqsg
Cus im only paying 6k for 1yr 10 months,btohqsg
wah where can find this kind of deal,btohqsg
Downpayment for a car left <2 years,btohqsg

12k can find 1 year 6 months meh,btohqsg
maybe in 2019 can  i had a 1 y 9 months car for 12k,btohqsg
a bit late to the party but the car i buy with coilover i dont like sia can feel all the humps unless go super slow,btohqsg
if i raise the height will it be better,btohqsg
If wan diy.. try to figure out how to soften the absorbers first,btohqsg
Usually at the top of coilovers for front via bonnetRear.. depends on design,btohqsg
If gg ws.. yeah raise height + ask ws set all to softest settings,btohqsg
If still cannot u can sell car or revert back to stock 👍,btohqsg
Rest of days take mrt mah. Not like need to drive everyday also?,btohqsg
Or just buy back stock absorbers maybe cheaper 😂,btohqsg
Lol nv get to test drive before buy ah..,btohqsg
got test but there are some things i didnt consciously take note of. maybe cause i test drive at lower speed also. only after take over the car drive at my own leisure then realise,btohqsg
test drive sometimes need zam abit,btohqsg
