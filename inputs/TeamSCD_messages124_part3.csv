I mean mine also fakr vtec,btohqsg
I never sat in yours at high rev,btohqsg
But I hear ppl say the k20a vtec is different,btohqsg
Mine since got throttle controller able to bring it fast to 4rpm if i put 0 normal it will take forver,btohqsg
Not as fast as your car,btohqsg
But this car is pretty interesting la... I got friend ride in it many times from no interest in car to like cars,btohqsg
@ishengjiegot approval also for euro r,btohqsg
Your steering wheel is the only thing i managed to see cool about itðŸ¤£ maybe sit in one go for ride differemt,btohqsg
Cause u keep it very clean not too much mods so nicee,btohqsg
Even kena stop only problem could be the steering,btohqsg
You see the red you know he special,btohqsg
I mean i nvr really saw his car only for like 3 seconds and then i left,btohqsg
But they say old cars having airbag more dangerous,btohqsg
Don't know what will fly out when it blows,btohqsg
Maybe put harness  but I got no idea where it bolts to,btohqsg
Also no idea where... One day must ask you,btohqsg
normally is under the rear seat's back rest,btohqsg
older cars might need dig. if not is don't have a t all,btohqsg
Never notice then at the back,btohqsg
the harness the drill to the floor,btohqsg
can try takata 6 point harness,btohqsg
harness cannot tie down 90deg liddat,btohqsg
You either install a harness bar if you want to keep your rear seats  or you tie to isofix,btohqsg
Then is not a fake vtec la,btohqsg
Then it doesn't sound very good for a 4 door car,btohqsg
Cos it's called a racing harness after all,btohqsg
If you mount in directly downwards  in an accident  you causing more stress on your spine,btohqsg
My friend's swift is he anchor to somewhere in the boot in his swift,btohqsg
â€¦. Why anyone want to do this,btohqsg
then when need to wear at sepang must knock down rear seats,btohqsg
Like that back seat passengers no chance to sit,btohqsg
This one is want look dont want life sia,btohqsg
prob should be pin behind ba,btohqsg
when got passenegrs cannot wear lor  keep the harness in the boot,btohqsg
So only install when go to track,btohqsg
but ppl wan harness and convenience too? haha,btohqsg
But you got harness is another issue,btohqsg
you need a helmet with HANs,btohqsg
Harness but not anchored properly will die leh,btohqsg
if not in an accident  your neck will break,btohqsg
So at the end of the day  you got 1 thing means need another thing,btohqsg
then end up become full race car,btohqsg
Like the example of the swift,btohqsg
If the car get t bone at rear fender,btohqsg
conventional seatbelt you realised you cann pull just a bit out before it locks,btohqsg
The harness gets pulled 20 cm backward,btohqsg
So end of the day  safety equipment actually not that safe,btohqsg
Steering wheel no airbags = Need helmetHarness = Need harness bar and HANS,btohqsg
Steering with airbag could also kill you,btohqsg
if you make it a claymore la,btohqsg
