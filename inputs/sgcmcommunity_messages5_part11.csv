I agree how many workplace have eV charger,btohqsg
my friend have so he bought  i dun have so stay ICE haha,btohqsg
even if they stop selling ice coe  easy enough just use 'mild hybrid',btohqsg
ice wont die one  ev wont be mainstream for another 30 years,btohqsg
U are rich to maintain an ice car by then,btohqsg
Apt of company stop producing ice car from 2030,btohqsg
dun keep push 1 type ICE or ev la haha  but this is true. go test drive will be amazed,btohqsg
what is the happiness level of tesla 3 so far? are they  happy,btohqsg
One day we will run out of fuel LOL,btohqsg
Yes but feel every 1 around u too slow,btohqsg
remove the plastic wheel cover. happier lolol,btohqsg
Looks happy but also i think people are selling Model 3 already LOL,btohqsg
Did u look at tesla resale price compared to new,btohqsg
Nobody believe that Kodak and Fuji film no more Liao,btohqsg
It like buying a new car due to no ad margin,btohqsg
I went to see nearby  got 1-2 public payavale la within 3-5km for most housing,btohqsg
i like any car that is nice and performs well,btohqsg
But cant use apple carplay on Teslas right,btohqsg
200k ev vs 100k ice.u topup petrol 27 years still cheaper,btohqsg
is test drive free on tesla,btohqsg
Free. But you need to get a slot first.,btohqsg
So hard to get. I registered for one in 2 months alr still never even call me back.,btohqsg
Try the performance 1 and floor,btohqsg
There no long range in sg,btohqsg
in england  hot. all sold out. cant get even second hand,btohqsg
too heavy is bad. very bad,btohqsg
Oh so the lighter the better?,btohqsg
U try to drive the awd model first,btohqsg
Hahahahah Later i go down tell them U RUBBISH HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
i would say up to 1.8 ton,btohqsg
more than that is a drag.,btohqsg
IT is. no range. porsche is late in EV and not good in EV at all. EV is battery tech and software.,btohqsg
serious. it is sort of like iphone. whereas germans are good at traditional mechnanical engineering stuff.,btohqsg
Model s also   I ask them why never bring in model s to show case in sg they said high demand no stock,btohqsg
that is why they try to catch up. closest i thik is VWE,btohqsg
Vw update is a joke and on ice platform,btohqsg
Tesla is years ahead of nearest competition.,btohqsg
And richer then all the car company combine,btohqsg
or you can add more battyeries to increasde range right? but super heavy. not practical. you got to seek a balance. EV  forget porsche or germans or japanese. they are way behind,btohqsg
Porsche EV better or Model 3 better?,btohqsg
Hahahahah i tot jap is way ahead in tech,btohqsg
tesla of course. decent good range. porsche taycan even slower than model s plaid,btohqsg
japanese refused to accept changes. and many germans too. because it means they would have to abandon ICE and switch  a decison that is hard to do,btohqsg
