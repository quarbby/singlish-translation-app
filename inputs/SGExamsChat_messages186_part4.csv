Meanwhile I wrote an arts essay becuase I was from drama,btohqsg
Reason #1 of why I took club ccas,btohqsg

Heard that H2 Physics prac no planning for this year lol,btohqsg
even if prac paper dont have,btohqsg
it can appear in p2/p3 as the 5%,btohqsg
There was a planning  but it was CLT so they crossed it out,btohqsg
wonder what they gonna do to the 5%,btohqsg
maybe subsume it with the remaining part of prac,btohqsg
My understanding is that the marks affected by CLT are simply not taken into account,btohqsg
I felt like I could have gotten an A if I did not do planning,btohqsg
i barely did my a lvl prac planning also,btohqsg
just to see if the rumours were true,btohqsg
95% of my entire cohort did not finish practical because of planning,btohqsg

if a teacher produces results for a class that is above school A% rate or even higher than national A% rates  he/she will be liable to promotion from MOE,btohqsg
quite an elitist way of promoting teachers  but oh well,btohqsg
'liable' makes it sounds like some kind of punishment,btohqsg
