It's up to you. Endowus recommend $100 above. I'm still deducting access fee credits right now,btohqsg

Anyone know of upcoming road shows? Can't find anything,btohqsg
The question is why are you looking for roadshow?,btohqsg
Yes  good. Sometimes they give Unionpay promos too,btohqsg
I want to sign up for OCBC 360 account and credit card.Hoping that roadshow will have some welcome offer.,btohqsg
The recent interest hikes across banks does make the OCBC 360 look promising as compared to the rest,btohqsg
Does it mean it's better to leave money in OCBC 360 rather than CPF topup/SRS for tax relief moving forward?,btohqsg
only when the interest is good,btohqsg
Yea. Thinking of changing from DBS Multiplier to OCBC 360 even though my mortgage is with DBS 😂,btohqsg
DBS just increased the rate for Multiplier but is minimal increase,btohqsg
Srs is still gold  you get 3.6% in ocbc,btohqsg
Been in decision dilemma lately on the contributions  thanks for your comment,btohqsg
Just to check  srs provides tax relieve but has no interest/gains unless used for investments right?,btohqsg
Yes  you can couple srs with aia wealth savvy 3 yearsTo get guaranteed returns,btohqsg
SRS may have gains if used in the proper investment channels,btohqsg
E wallet  you need to be at the counter,btohqsg
What’s the fastest way for trust bank card to register the 5 uses per month ah?Every month wastes 2-3days waiting for it to tick is not very attractive. Haha!!,btohqsg
Any wisesaver users here? Hows your review on it?,btohqsg
How come we need funds in Poems Cash+ in order to use SRS?,btohqsg
Just to share  overseas retail spend via Amaze MC earns you instapoints. Not applicable for F&B. Unsure for Groceries.,btohqsg
In case your SRS not enough money they will deduct it from cash,btohqsg
It is the 1% cashback  applicable to normal spend  including F&B,btohqsg
One question  can I use the Citibank rewards card and link to amaze card and pay for water electricity bill and earn reward?,btohqsg
Should I just get a simpler card instead,btohqsg
Basically I normally pay utility bill and I usually use paywave to pay for food. I usually will spend 800 per month. Can someone suggest me a card.,btohqsg
simpler means less rewards. And even simpler cards have exclusions or for the case of Amex cards less merchants accept Amex,btohqsg
