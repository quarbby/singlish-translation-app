Okay la u tmr update me what u want,btohqsg
Next time must jioMy car take longer to hit 200 but need to try after install handling stuff b4 road-trip,btohqsg
bro we talking kph hor.. not mph..,btohqsg
I dont even know mine can hit 200 or not,btohqsg
you can find out soon :D,btohqsg
I dont think sepang long enough for me to hit,btohqsg
i hit abt 193/194 den balls shrink haha,btohqsg
slowly up la  u feel floaty den dont le lor,btohqsg
but ok dunno how the feel in mx5 haha,btohqsg
Cos the soft top starts flopping at 170 or so,btohqsg
Can one la. Just do it,btohqsg
Can I ask  how often do you guys rotate tyres?,btohqsg
Wah 170   190   200And here i am can't even hit 160,btohqsg
Especially if theres some negative camber,btohqsg
at that speed better cover top hahah,btohqsg
U can try every servicing u rotate it,btohqsg
my friend's golf didnt rotate for 35k. front botak  rear feels like new lol,btohqsg
So your tyres usually rotate a few times before changing?,btohqsg
i aim for 1x.. 20-25k range. mafan to keep rotate also haha,btohqsg
bmw f20  I think -1.5 or smth on the rear  need check later,btohqsg
Yar   that time already told you allWhack already will have burnt smell,btohqsg
car kena whack is happy car 😂,btohqsg
wa this is cuz of the camber..?,btohqsg
i wld say depends on ur driving but rough gauge 15k,btohqsg
car ride high wan go how fast bro haha. must be safe,btohqsg
if you want to be safe 10-12 can rotate le,btohqsg
cant be helped 99 bends is just next door,btohqsg
oki but rotate is front to back only right,btohqsg
so the inner side will still wear more,btohqsg
That's why i getting coilover after my spoilers,btohqsg
u on square set up hor,btohqsg
both front and rear tyre size the same,btohqsg
yep no need worry 12k lor,btohqsg
No bloody way u peak at 160,btohqsg
i dont think you have fierce front camber hor,btohqsg
My 1.6 mz3 also can 180,btohqsg
but i tink 1.8 hybrid accelerate like slow ah,btohqsg
okay lor then no need worry,btohqsg
rear is the one thats visibly obvious,btohqsg
haha i know somebody running 3°,btohqsg
Time to go do some tuning,btohqsg
Really 160 step full go down the highway slope at cte sle also same,btohqsg
also worn but aint that bad,btohqsg
My RPM capped at 5RPM only,btohqsg
Ur right foot is eco mode la,btohqsg
annoying is thats the inner side so its not easy to see and check regularly,btohqsg
last time i tot 1.8 + a hybrid shd be power,btohqsg
bend down cannot see ah haha,btohqsg
U have a sport mode or manual mode that u can engage?,btohqsg
no eh  need jack up then can see,btohqsg
Sometimes the auto will shift at the rev limit,btohqsg
ps4 not a durable tyre sia,btohqsg
Ouh yarForget about that mode HAHAHA,btohqsg
A lot of rental car got power cut,btohqsg
I ECO mode step full deh,btohqsg
u think PS4 is bad  bridgestone is even worse,btohqsg
Eco mode the ecu is very conservative,btohqsg
potenza ah? I only heard PZero no durability,btohqsg
My friend 1.6 hybrid shuttle sports mode capped 180 also,btohqsg
Yeah all the potenza wear very fast,btohqsg
but its better than PS4S imo,btohqsg
I was actl thinking get GY F1A6,btohqsg
and I like the sidewall a bit more,btohqsg
How about u try off eco mode first,btohqsg
Lol sometimes its better not to touch shit regarding ecu,btohqsg
Can but improvement abt 10 to 15hp only cause no turbo,btohqsg
Playing with the ecu of a hybrid car  unless existing tested and proven maps  quite risky,btohqsg
Have yet to try because been busyAt night no go out whack also nowadays,btohqsg
Need find renowned tuners to be safe haha,btohqsg
We call it “rushing to work”,btohqsg
And see me mount kerb like the JB civic,btohqsg
The point of a SUV is u can mount and carry on,btohqsg
Siao liao siao liao siao liao,btohqsg
I scared i up coilover than spoiler done,btohqsg
If ur spoiler from taobao  yes,btohqsg
Also not sure how your coilover can break your spoiler  no link,btohqsg
CF WINGS in long it's KS1 SPORTS,btohqsg
A spoiler on a chr is so high up,btohqsg
Hahaha ltr from 160 nvr open drs become 140,btohqsg
U worry more about it hitting the height limit barriers,btohqsg
Cannot spoil my coilover but spoil my wallet,btohqsg
U buy chr then put spoiler and coils and now complain money,btohqsg
My hse car stock one haha,btohqsg
If not wife kpkb on fb say 60K in 6 months,btohqsg
This one can go changi take off,btohqsg
Is there a zoom out picture,btohqsg
There is a wing behind the wing,btohqsg
Why need 2 pair of wing,btohqsg
Chr drink 2 cans of redbull,btohqsg
The downforce is coming from the weight liao not the airflow,btohqsg
uh so u spending 4k on 10hp and 20nm of torque,btohqsg
This one for picnic can use as table,btohqsg
Like MY like to say1 not satki enough buy 2 🤣,btohqsg
But actually alot of factors to consider ah,btohqsg
yeah.. put 98 into hybrid chr,btohqsg
haha with that money just go buy a second hand turbo car without cvt😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
But theres also problem with reliability and how much coe left,btohqsg
Hybrid not meant to go fastIt's meant for head turners,btohqsg
You go so fast how people admire 🤣,btohqsg
so putting A380 wing on the car is a head turner ah,btohqsg
btw this is very much illegal,btohqsg
Ch-r also yes but in a different way,btohqsg
Putting a loud exhaust also what for most of you,btohqsg
Hybrid is meant to be cheaper due to decreased consumption of fuel. If you put 98 into the car might aswell dont buy hybrid😂😂,btohqsg
Different people want diff mods ma he want visual then let him be ahh,btohqsg
So can piak piak instead cheyyyyy,btohqsg
Just trying to understand that rationale,btohqsg
minister say need small space only,btohqsg
Can see from rear windscreen then,btohqsg
The sun very hot arh nowadays,btohqsg
But chr the back window abit small,btohqsg
Need walk to the back to peep in,btohqsg
Same I also don't know if I can hit,btohqsg
i dUnNo iF i CaN hIt 200,btohqsg
cannot be need 2 seconds from 97-100,btohqsg
8 to 9s more like it,btohqsg
So roi one is 1.8 or 2.0,btohqsg
Dunno what he have done also,btohqsg
Can your RX8 hit 10k rpm,btohqsg
For the manual it will need tuning to actually do it without breaking stuff,btohqsg
For the auto the bottleneck is the torque converter,btohqsg
219 being the peak means 200 is definitely doable without breaking stuff,btohqsg
Ahhh i still rmb the 10300 rpm youtubr video,btohqsg
No ahh haha i dont drive a chr,btohqsg
Below 20 still count as kid right,btohqsg
wait i was reading thru the messages  i thought u wanted tune car haha,btohqsg
Ohh no laa he said his car was slow so i asked him to go tune,btohqsg
The tuning by mazda for mass production was to meet roadworthiness and emissions standards in UK and US,btohqsg
If i recall the manual stock beeps at 9k,btohqsg
Auto will always beep at 8,btohqsg
Because torque converter rated to 7500 rpm,btohqsg
When they hunting gear the car will shake,btohqsg
CVT was created for comfortable street driving,btohqsg
The objective was even power delivery through the torque band,btohqsg
Sometimes drive halfway will no power,btohqsg
Then step abit will sudd go zoom,btohqsg
Never drove a CVT  but ive never heard good things abt it,btohqsg
ohh what car the guy drive,btohqsg
And honestly now with EV…. Cvt is kinda pointless,btohqsg
Have you heard cvt with modified exhaust,btohqsg
don’t tune chr la haha walau,btohqsg
an EV motor achieves everything CVT tries to mimic  and without effort,btohqsg
so expensive for just 10hp or so,btohqsg
My hse car also same range one,btohqsg
Unless is performance version if not need tune ah,btohqsg
some cars are not meant to be tuned,btohqsg
Even if 320i i prob will tune bm3,btohqsg
But cvt car i abit scared to tune,btohqsg
Never know when the cvt will shit itself,btohqsg
All i will say is upgrade your brakes before u chase horses,btohqsg
And dont be surprised when engine longevity drops….,btohqsg
Horse cannot chase finish one la,btohqsg
U wanna chase need go illegal,btohqsg
Even 1k HP GTR also will piang GB every launch,btohqsg
U cannot change na to fi with very few exceptions,btohqsg
Change turbo is change exhaust parts,btohqsg
Also sg how much horses u need,btohqsg
As long as not attrage slow,btohqsg
Untraceable just means fine + mandatory to change to stock for next inspect,btohqsg
This is for 800kg car leh,btohqsg
Merging on highway i super scared,btohqsg
Dont make loud and nobody will bother,btohqsg
U make loud  every few months will have inspection,btohqsg
I hear cvt vezel change exhaust,btohqsg
Depend on how they behave. Some ppl 30 yo still act like kid,btohqsg
CVT and exhaust sound no correlation ah bro,btohqsg
The exhaust sound is just 1 note ah,btohqsg
U listen to too many performance car liao,btohqsg
Not so stock one a bit different,btohqsg
How come mod alr become slower haha,btohqsg
Your discussion on 200 insults him,btohqsg
Slow driver don't need top speed,btohqsg
He teleport from one traffic light to the next,btohqsg
Whats your rpm when cruising at 90,btohqsg
Later I check the rpm again,btohqsg
I always confuse bigger number is turn more or less per crank,btohqsg
This i not sure... But higher number  lower top speed. But more acceleration,btohqsg
Cannot be ahNext time we go JB cruise,btohqsg
Tell lies faster than gear change,btohqsg
Have anyone tried attrage top speed,btohqsg
I'd be surprised if it even hits 180 or 160,btohqsg
U can make a guess based on the hp and kerb weight,btohqsg
I would say not above 170,btohqsg
Their brochure says 170  so probably 160 is attainable under road conditions,btohqsg
Attrage is so light tho. I’d be worried about the traction more than anything else,btohqsg
Kia koup  I can push to 180,btohqsg
The car dont feel solid haha,btohqsg
Anyone here using NETS motoring card with auto top up?,btohqsg
