Hi just a general question on credit limit. If i'm in the 30-120k bracket which grants a max of 4x monthly income. Does this limit apply to each bank or overall? eg I can have 4 credit cards with each being max of 4x monthly income?,btohqsg
Hello everyone  new here. Watched the YouTube on Chocolate + HeyMax and ended up here. I have a burning question  can you link your UOB PRIV MILES Visa to HeyMax? If so does that mean you can get points on HeyMax as well as UNI$ on UOB PRIV MILES?,btohqsg
Kinda. Like the current promo between visa card and heymax.,btohqsg
Thank you  so this is an agreement basically between VISA and HeyMax  VISA's contract with the banks is independent of whatever HeyMax give us ya.,btohqsg
Hi guys! I've got a question... Now that amaze is excluded from uob's eligibile transactions  is it still worth while to use the uob lady's solitaire card on overseas dining to earn 4mpd  considering the 3.25% foreign transaction fee and the banks unfavourable exchange rates?,btohqsg
What card do u have for overseas dining that‚Äôs better?Also why aren‚Äôt u adding on Uob lady savings account for bonus 2mpd?,btohqsg
Anyway for me  I‚Äôm using trust cashback with dining bonus category when I travel.,btohqsg
None  this 4mpd card is the best I've got in hand üòÖ,btohqsg
Idk  maybe I should? But will need to calculate to see if it's worth the opportunity cost,btohqsg
Sorry I meant to ask if it's worth while to ''buy'' those miles by paying the higher exchange rate and foreign transaction fees.,btohqsg
Ask yourself what is ur value of mile. üòÜ then you can answer if its worth paying 3.25% fee for 4mpd,btohqsg
I will be doing big ticket purchase this weekend. Any recommendation for cashback card?,btohqsg

If you can meet spend requirement $800  is paywave using UOB Evol in oversea a better option if your spend is less than S$200 in oversea?,btohqsg
Yes if u use 4mpd and above cards,btohqsg

Hi Can I check apple app subscription is it considered in 4miles for amaze plus citi reward,btohqsg
Hi  amaze+citi rewards will earn 4mpd in cardup?,btohqsg
Hi  if i am just looking to open a uob one acc  and to get  miles cc. With most expenses on  groceries  online shopping and what cc do you reccomend,btohqsg
Lady‚Äôs card is the only miles card that counts towards the $500 spend for UOB one account,btohqsg
so if i were to use any other miles cc asides from the ladys card  there would be no point in using a uob one since i won't meet the criteria?,btohqsg
can clock min 500 on uob lady and the rest on other miles cc,btohqsg
Only spending on lady‚Äôs card count towards the criteria for bonus interest. You can apply and use other cards also  but just make sure you spend 500 on lady‚Äôs card for bonus interest. UNI$ pools for all cards  so no harm applying for a few UOB miles cards.,btohqsg

Hello! For credit cards that includes priority pass lounge access  how do I register for it if I have multiple CC with priority pass?I read that all CC with PP can be linked to 1 email but also read smth like each PP will need a unique email. Not sure which is which. What is the updated priority pass management now?,btohqsg
Nope. They need unique account name. Email can share 1.,btohqsg
Ohh I see  meaning I can register all the priority passes to just 1 email? Will I be given another physical PP card or it will also be shared?,btohqsg
I have 3 diff PP acct to the same email. Physical card pp has been phased out for most cc so no need to worry about that.,btohqsg
Each account name will have a unique member number. You need to keep track of the cards and number of visit remaining.  For iphone  you can add the card into your wallet,btohqsg
Ohh stanchart journey still gave me a physical PP card,btohqsg
Can I just use any one of the cards to access the visits from different CC or it has to be specific?,btohqsg
Add the card into wallet so you can flash the card for them to scan. But do know that it is almost impossible to get waiver for journey card at the second year,btohqsg
It doesnt have to be specific but you need to make sure the card has remaining visit left. You can install the priority pass app  it will display that. Unless you using a card with unlimited lounge access,btohqsg
Anyone got forex comparison between tiger  MooMoo  ib  syfe?,btohqsg
Yep  I do have the priority pass app. But will I see all the lounge remaining visits from diff cards in 1 account? Or since its a diff account name with unique membership number. Every PP account will only display what that credit card offers?,btohqsg
You need different accounts. Need to log in and out to see. Better use something like nelsonCitiPremier  nelsonDBSAlt etc to differentiate.,btohqsg
Sorry I dont understand about making sure the card have remaining visit left. Can I use any one of the PP card issued even though by diff CC to access the the lounge visits offer across all my CCs?,btohqsg
I see  thats a very good idea  thanks for the advice.,btohqsg
On PP  I have 12 visits per year. Can I bring 2 guests plus myself ( 3 visits) at one go.,btohqsg
Your PP is from which credit card? Diff card diff TnC.,btohqsg
I dont know what cards you have except journey man. But most CC are using Priority pass program which is common. Use priority pass app to check which lounge are under this program. Check your tnc,btohqsg
