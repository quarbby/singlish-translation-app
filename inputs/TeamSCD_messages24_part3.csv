The regulations set limits on the maximum noise level that can be emitted by motor vehicles of various classes. The limit for motorcycles  for example  is 94 decibels  while the limit for motor cars  station wagons  and taxis is 96 decibels  or 100 if the engine is at the rear end of the vehicle,btohqsg
