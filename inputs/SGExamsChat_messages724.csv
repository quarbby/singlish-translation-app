and she can only say that cuz she in the industry,btohqsg
Er give number on how much they shld be paid ah,btohqsg
still just water..not like anything special could be shown like science,btohqsg

all jobs should be paid more,btohqsg
A - AbysmalB - BadC - CatastrophicD - DelightfulE - ExcellentS - SuperbU - Unparalleled intelligence,btohqsg
they shld lower the cost of living,btohqsg

furthest career advancements you can go in a dead end job..like nurses or teachers or staffers,btohqsg

Teachers only dead end if u make it,btohqsg
they make a lot more than u think,btohqsg
With social media in this generation gg,btohqsg
They make as much as our fellow allied health professionals,btohqsg
so uh on twitter apparently now you can make highly realistic AI videos of dogs in the snow  for example. deepfakes  artificial voice actors. people are scared that real people such as voice actors and actual onscreen actors will get their job replaced by AI. what are yʼalls take?,btohqsg
i once asked my poa teacher if he ever considered being a accountant or finding another job that could use his knowledge in business and poa. He said  normally. jobs outside require more experience than what teachers teach students,btohqsg
did you know deep fake technology has been around for very long time,btohqsg
ik tchers dont get paid during holidays,btohqsg

feels so nice to shit for the next 3 hours after being productive for 1 hour,btohqsg
We quite literally known for it,btohqsg
at least i don't take KiLMe,btohqsg
So basically Bio and maths yall hate lah ACJC students,btohqsg
honestly  my exp with tsd was quite bumpy considering its a coursework subj but if u have exp taking a coursework subj i think that should be no prob. the workload is a lot but tbh quite fun if ur passionate about drama and theatre. and also  our cher said its literally impossible to fail tsd and its honestly quite true 👊 although we thought we would do atrociously for promos  we all scored Bs and Cs :D since its a small class (theres 10 of us) its also super chill and the environment is very safe for us to really just be ourselves without judgement. so generally tsd is very fun and to me personally it doesnt really feel like an actual subj sometimes (which tbf can pose some challenges as well) and honestly i would highly advice u to take it as well as it serves as a nice refresher in comparison to the other subjects ur gonna take 😝😝 if u have any other qns PLS ASK ME i will gladly provide my services,btohqsg
Wait have y'all seen chiobu's in rp,btohqsg
apparently acjc requires you to take H1 maths in an arts combi,btohqsg
TM allows H2 maths even for arts stream,btohqsg
O i going to go funorama and find u,btohqsg
so HELp isn't possible unless 4H2??? but prob need to appeal,btohqsg
I think Acjc most ppl get A for tsd,btohqsg
Go on insta look up the diff rp cca and u will find,btohqsg
so cannot take h2 math ?,btohqsg
so like HELP cannot but HELM is ok la,btohqsg
O did i tell u i banned lcw*,btohqsg
dude I think everyone here knows that,btohqsg
Hmm I thought it was quite common,btohqsg
Maybe it’s for tmjc that it’s rare,btohqsg
bro this lcw keeps on talking about jerking off to his ogls  no shit this idiot gonna get banned,btohqsg
did u ban me by accident too,btohqsg
At keesiao bot ban at lcw,btohqsg
n then he actually got banned,btohqsg
n then i was like oops,btohqsg
No i forgot how to unban people,btohqsg
Iirc H2 physics means must take H2 maths no arguing,btohqsg
see for urself a lot of chio ppl,btohqsg
Then like bio only got 1 class got h1 maths,btohqsg
I salute all the females who went to cjc for being very brave. They took an incredible risk by going there  knowing that at any time  as a result  they too could become pregnant,btohqsg
wait is it some schs dont allow h2 bio with h1 math,btohqsg
since my chat history got leaked I might as well leak his chat history too,btohqsg
lol my classmate here ofc chip,btohqsg
But my sch allowed bio chem w H1 maths,btohqsg
I have the stand of it being a waste of time tho,btohqsg
