Focus on reducing counters and minimising damage. Many people lose this period  gonna take some time to bring back sentiments to usual. Today's bounce looks like a dead cat. Not sure  but stay wary. I took about 30-40k damage cutting this 2 days. Just play safe  survive and fight when times are easier.,btohqsg
Thank god I did not buy warehouse there.. if not stuck..,btohqsg
Yea  play safe. I lose your Clearbridge about 10k. Biolidics allâ€™s another 10k,btohqsg
Dax hope you huat back from Moya,btohqsg
re entered and died . lol,btohqsg
Dax only lose 30k but he nvr tell us how much he profited?,btohqsg
I still havenâ€™t cut  was -$40k yesterday  recover till -$33k for today,btohqsg
Chasen managed to flip up 73/74. earlier i was hesitating within 2 decisions.1) Cut my balance 300 lots 72 or2) Mouth the entire 73.Went for item 1. Wrong choice... Confidence hit...,btohqsg
Chasen strong somehow.. I need the funds for some work venture so i take back some from market today.,btohqsg
Choice 2 might have triggered the BBs perhaps to clear 74 and 75.Can tell that got some players supporting Chasen.,btohqsg
See lasup stock.  Fry up and down using story.Now dry liao,btohqsg
My biggest fear is a wide market crash like last year Feb 20 type.,btohqsg
$30k profit from YZJ and STA and another $19k from other counter investment help me stay cool  else every night cry to sleep,btohqsg
Power la bro...previous profit so much...heng,btohqsg
Chasen $0.077. All Should be in the money. OTOT. Good luck!,btohqsg
chasen bb flexing to our boss dax ðŸ˜³,btohqsg
Chasen BBs wants the attention. Run in a difficult market,btohqsg
should have went for my option 2 to mouth the 73. Argh. nvm  i will be back lol,btohqsg
can watch Thomson Medical also... been around this range. just dont know when. results should be at the end of the month.,btohqsg
Healthway you reckon can bounce to 36 at least?,btohqsg
i didnt get to run the last round. this one really hold super long.,btohqsg
hopefully it runs again when TM runs,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think so bro. Such crash happens like once in a decade. Last yr one was overdue. Covid was just a narrative. In between  will have corrections and pullbacks for sure. Nevertheless letâ€™s not predict nor follow news. Letâ€™s get the clues from SPX. If price remains below dma50 for more than 3 days then watch out. Currently all MAs sloping up nicely,btohqsg
last round spike to 39  u didnt out?,btohqsg
didnt. was busy that morning. by the time see  it was back to square. my EP 36,btohqsg
Hopefully man  anyways  sentiments not good now. retailers not in the mood to risks. lesser players also. not much buyers. I'll stay light for a bit.,btohqsg
Hmm  these days the BBs dont give us much time to take profit. they really just provide a short time window span to make decision on tp,btohqsg
See already scare to touch penny stocks .,btohqsg
i missed the 73 mouth  if i mouth 77 and stuck  i'll tilt though haha,btohqsg
hmm not sure on this.. depends on the new buyers tgt scalp or tgt higher i guess,btohqsg
yup  looks like broke out of a downtrend and trading sideways for now.. resistance 89/90,btohqsg
i think it was the right mouth to do 77  nonetheless.. hope you did it,btohqsg
The eggs tells the whole market ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Jetstar Asia requires all employees to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by Oct 1This makes it the first airline in Singapore to impose such a requirement.âœˆhttps://tdy.sg/3mdkAPm@todayonlinesg,btohqsg
No vaccine cannot work ? ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
JT today one day affair  back to starting point...,btohqsg
Moya Asia safe now. just flushing. I believe the play for Moya Asia will be very similar to Chasen,btohqsg
Statistically it will not happen so soon,btohqsg
relax  drink coffee and stay calm,btohqsg
