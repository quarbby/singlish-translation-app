Bruh I still dunno how to use & and * in C++,btohqsg
So you tell me I also bobo,btohqsg
* is still C  but the & one is mysterious to me,btohqsg
i don't use cpp too much anyway,btohqsg
well & is technicall logical AND,btohqsg
but it's also used as an operator to grab memory,btohqsg
in cpp you can do some magic with it to make your function pass by reference without needing to pass pointers around,btohqsg
anyway the code is there  take it or leave it,btohqsg
your original plan of doing everything in 1 array is....,btohqsg
it's possible  but then you might as well be using structs,btohqsg
Must be cuz no vectors in C I guess?,btohqsg
If I remove the first column do u think it's possible to do an array,btohqsg
@andrewomeYou know EEPROM? she doing also apparently,btohqsg
Watch YouTube vids get entertained can liao,btohqsg
Ya I rather not touch also,btohqsg
i did throw a life boey already,btohqsg
All I can say is  I can't help cuz too much hardware/EE,btohqsg
I'll send u a $2 consolation prize since you helped somewhat (although I don't get it at all),btohqsg
Hi yes please save my hypothetical soul,btohqsg
Tldr she wants to make a mini rdbms w cpp,btohqsg
Basically is this.Somehow need to make a mixed type 4-column array,btohqsg
Tuple of 4 ints  tuple of 2 ints  tuple of 2ints  tuple of 5 ints,btohqsg
So I need to do this or some version of this  basically I need something that can store data  can be edited on userend and can add rows for new users,btohqsg
You need a UI for this or?,btohqsg
Wtf doing this on a microcontroller wtf,btohqsg
Your user using the microcontroller or?,btohqsg
wait i am confused why need microcontroller,btohqsg
Cuz her course said so I assume,btohqsg
I don't even wanna be an engineer :'),btohqsg
Bruh not all engineer need do microcontroller,btohqsg
wait ah lemme finish my game then i think about it,btohqsg
At this point I can understand why your group mates give up tbh,btohqsg
I tot she say they write rubbish code,btohqsg
They completely didn't do shit what do u mean,btohqsg
Can I ask original project length,btohqsg
If they knew it wasn't possible they would tell me like 3 weeks ago,btohqsg
and maybe needing to implement your own resizable array,btohqsg
They didn't even care to search until they gave me half assed code to me this afternoon,btohqsg
My project is due TMR 1pm,btohqsg
This should be implementable for ur project,btohqsg
how many users are you supposed to accomodate,btohqsg
and what kind of data we talkkng,btohqsg
and which mc are you using,btohqsg
Theoretically infinite but can cap it,btohqsg
if you want to use mc you definitely need to cap it,btohqsg
As written in the drawing  but the pin can change to all numbers,btohqsg
data as in i assume your mc can handle char input but what kind of dsta,btohqsg
Probably can change to all int,btohqsg
Mixed type array [tuple of 4 int tuple of 2 int tuple of 2 int tuple of 5 int]or some equiv I assume,btohqsg
do you have a choice to like add in components theoretically,btohqsg
