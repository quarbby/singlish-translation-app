So all. Just FYI. I use instarem amaze with crmc and its been ok except for one dubious transaction attempt initially that didn't go through.But I recently tried to do funds transfer using instarem and it has been the most frustrating experience ever. Absolutely terrible service. My transaction has been held for no reason  the chat support asks me to write a ticket. The ticket support is glitchy. They ask for document and don't specify what document they want. There is no live phone number and the mobile interface to navigate forms is horrendous. My worst mistake trying this service - should have paid the extra $20 and done a bank to bank transfer from DBS likr i usually did. Please be warned- instarem is great when things go well  but when there is an issue- its terrible.,btohqsg
the logic of this app is so confusing. one time i want to transfer money to my friend  it kept on making me add new receipt even though i alreay added a few people.,btohqsg
hi   is there ways to earn points from paying cc bills ?,btohqsg

SC response and react time is very slow,btohqsg
Hi guys  i bought  SBAug22 GX22080V 3% andSBNov22 GX221 10A 3.21 %Should Iwithdraw out and put all into uob to hit 100k instead?cause SSB rate will be for 10 yrs and uob acc interest rate might get lower in the future .,btohqsg
Just a quick question.With different bank accounts offering good rates  do you guys actually maintain different account? Or just probably live w 1-2 accounts?,btohqsg
I have one acc with each of the 3 local banks. But only one is actively used at a time  see which one give better interest then switch to it.,btohqsg
