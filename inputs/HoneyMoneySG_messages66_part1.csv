Hi guys just a question  I understand that it‚Äôs possible to do a SALA transfer from DBS to UOB One to be qualified for the salary interest. However have anyone tried doing SALA transfer from OCBC to UOB One and if it works?,btohqsg
Since it is just a simple task  you can just do a transfer n try it out to see if it works.,btohqsg
Quick question. Fave / ShopBack / kris / XNAP paired with citi rewards considered online spend for 4mpd?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve tried but doesn‚Äôt see it in the UOB One interest tracker so I wonder if I‚Äôm doing it the wrong way or it just doesn‚Äôt work  hoping to hear from those who‚Äôve experience,btohqsg
I‚Äôve tried  OCBC doesn‚Äôt allow me to input SALA as the reason for transfer. Only DBS does,btohqsg
UOB credit card can‚Äôt be paid by other bank account?,btohqsg
can. just input the credit card  number of the UOB CC then can pay ald,btohqsg
hi for UOB EVOL I have satisfied the spend criteria for Jul but this month I only get $1 cashback. Anyone knows how the cashback works?,btohqsg
The account number is the credit card number?,btohqsg
Yeah the 16 number for your CC card,btohqsg
Means u didn't hit the criteria,btohqsg
Read the T&Cs  review your statement  then chat with UOB live chat or email if there are any discrepancies,btohqsg
Ok just to check  Sept should be getting Jul cashback right not Aug,btohqsg
it goes by statement month not calendar month. Receive cashback end of next statement.,btohqsg
Any UOB EVOL users here? I called in the UOB hotline. I was told that the cashback will only be given once $600 min spending for 3 consecutive months‚Ä¶ Is this true? Went to check the terms and conditions‚Ä¶ no mention of this term though‚Ä¶,btohqsg
False. But it‚Äôs credit 1 month after month end.,btohqsg
3 mths is for uob 1 .....,btohqsg
Hi Guys  sorry to ask again. Does payment to SP Group/Senoko qualify for the min spend of S$599? Thank you!,btohqsg
Can read the tnc but usually most banks exclude utilities which Sp senoko certainly is.Uob sign up bonus confirm exclude utilities. I just looked at it yesterday,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúXnap citi rewards‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
How do you know you satisfied the spend criteria?What did you spend on the $600? Did you spend it on any exclusion items?,btohqsg
ShopBack Shopee and Apple pay only,btohqsg
Guys  Citi rewards card still work with amaze?,btohqsg
How much you have spend above $600?,btohqsg
How much you spend the $622 on UOB merchants?,btohqsg
What is UOB merchant  I spend on dining using apply pay and XNAP and Shopee that‚Äôs all,btohqsg
This list of merchants are excluded from Evol. If your total spend on these merchants is more than $22 on that month  your total qualified spend will be less than $600. With this you are not entitle for the cashback.https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/card-privileges/uob-dollar.page,btohqsg
Maribank increasing their interest to 2.88%  higher than GXS.,btohqsg
Hi Bosses  is REIT more risky investment than SG ETF? If so how much margin?,btohqsg
For marybank only can join by invitation?,btohqsg

Does UOB lady card (dining category) work with XNAP to get 6mpd?,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúUnsecured loan‚Äù to search chat history related to this query.Good luck to you,btohqsg
maybe kenna classified as topup transaction (shopee pay),btohqsg
No leh I only use card,btohqsg
if you get $1... means you are likely to have deemed not to meet the minimum $600 spend..so something had been classified as excluded spend.If you get $21 ish then you know one side passed one side failed.,btohqsg
$500 x 0.3% = $1.50 sounds about what u got,btohqsg
Question  I am not an existing moomoo user.If I just join this promotion with simple intention to get 5.8% return for that 30 days.Can I just put deposit $80k (I assume it‚Äôs the max) and subscribing to 1 of the cash plus fund. Thereafter withdrawing all $80k after 30days?Will I still get the 5.8% cash plus the my initial outlay?,btohqsg
Initial deposit amount is not guaranteed  only the 5.8% returns is guaranteed but the risk is lower than poems' MMF,btohqsg
Yall still trust GXS after the stunt they pull meh,btohqsg
Poems MMF my intial deposited amount rose by 3.085% / P.A after putting for 14 days (31 Aug- 14 Sep) thus far.Those who put with moomoo  did your deposit amount go up or down by how much? Excluding the 5.8% returns.,btohqsg
Yes. For new users get the 5.8% as well,btohqsg
I dont think so. Do I need to be on margin account and tiered to be able to do this?,btohqsg
