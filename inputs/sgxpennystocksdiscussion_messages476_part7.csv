Your Afternoon Quick Read ‚Äì 20 July 2021Tencent: Out of the shadow with a bangThe Hong Kong tech group  Tencent Holdings  announced plans to buy Sumo Group  a UK-based games maker. It is an all-cash deal that is worth around $1.26 billion. Tencent will be buying all the shares of Sumo Group that it does not own through its subsidiary  Sixjoy Hong Kong Limited  for 513 pence each.UK based game makers shineIn what seems to be a tomato day for investors  UK based games makers enjoy the shine. In particular  the Sumo Group blast higher on Monday. The deal is so lucrative that it might deter competitors from challenging Tencent offers  given that it is a rich premium of 43% compared to Sumo‚Äôs closing price on Friday  16 July.Hence  it seems that the investors of Sumo have no reason to reject the juicy deal.A win-win situation for Tencent and SumoFor Sumo  it will be a stamp of confirmation in the gaming industry and perhaps into the Chinese market that has been almost out of reach to the company. It is not a stranger move for Tencent as it has stakes in dozens of foreign game companies. Tencent has an investment in Riot Games that makes ‚ÄúLeague of Legends‚Äù  and it also holds about 40% shares in Epic Games.Since the onset of the pandemic  content creation has been a valuable asset. Games production is one of such classes. Many investors see Sumo as a rare gem  for it is a pure-play developer essentially. Imagine having to bring onboard thousand of experienced developers  it will be a talent acquisition nightmare. The ecosystem embedded in Sumo further support the growing appetite for M&A in the region.The deal presents a fantastic diversification opportunity for the gaming arm of Tencent as it moves out beyond its stronghold market- China.The hunger for deals in the UK gaming industryThe UK has been a fertile ground for gaming deals. In February  we saw how Electronic Arts had outbid its rival Take-Two Interactive Software to buy Codemasters  a car racing games group  for $1.2 billion.Epic Games also purchased Tonic Games  which made the famous game ‚ÄúFall Guys‚Äù based in the UK in March.The latest move to acquire Sumo shows a vibrant gaming industry growing and glowing on the backdrop of an ongoing pandemic recovery phase.The chase for content is vast and endless. We can expect more tech giants to take an express route through acquisition to add content to their platforms since internal developments of such content will take years and intensive capital.Till then  we await the US market today!Cheers  Pika Nat.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach a wider audience.,btohqsg
