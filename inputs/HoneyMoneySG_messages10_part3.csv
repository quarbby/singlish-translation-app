can touch&go ewallet link to youtrip and minus directly without topping up to wallet for like msia qr transaction?,btohqsg
adhoc topupjust throw in a lumpsum,btohqsg
Hi. Would like to check with experts here.. Is there a difference if topping up into  cpf MA any time of the year VS topping up at the end of year December? 🙏 Will the interest yield differ?,btohqsg
No ringgit to store in YT  it will auto convert from sgd at time of spending with card,btohqsg
If I’m not wrong 12 months is the minimum period,btohqsg

hi Chris  just got my ezlink MC. is GPMC a good way to top up so that can get 1.5% cashback?,btohqsg
Don't think you can earn 1.5% with GPMC -> EZ link,btohqsg
but if you're asking for amex tcb  then yeah why not,btohqsg
yes  i meant amex tcb. do u also topup with GPMC?,btohqsg
Yes  but small amounts only. Don't wanna leave so much in EZ Link wallet,btohqsg
can i ask  if anyone got any cold wallet recommendations or guide that i can read to transfer out of my cryptos from exchanges?,btohqsg
This card no matter how I think.. only good for people with car. I can’t hit so much dining and grocery sia.,btohqsg
Just buy fairprice or other grocery gift card every few months to hit the minimum.,btohqsg
But the gift card value will accumulate and getting more without actually spending it?,btohqsg
Not worried about minimum.. rather more worried about not getting more cashback haha.,btohqsg
Every few months. Left small balance then again buy giftcard,btohqsg
It is better than UOB one?,btohqsg
Anyone go msia frequently? Want to ask about their data SIM card.,btohqsg
Do you know the XOX prepaid sim?,btohqsg
nope  I don't know XOX prepaid sim,btohqsg
28 Month validity  RM60 = 10GB for 1 month + 10GB in season pass (which you can withdraw any time you need data within the validity of the sim card),btohqsg
Just get SIMBA TPG MY130$10-$12 sgd per mth,btohqsg
Most value for $No need spend extra supporting another prepaid card and it's validity,btohqsg
XOX is good if you travel frequently but not so frequent (say a few times per month) because you can keep the sim card without monthly top up,btohqsg
TPG MY13010gb for use in msia100gb for use in SGonly 30rm for both countries lolYour choice,btohqsg

Is it possible to open another grab account to double the 30k limit?,btohqsg

Most VOIP services are quite cheap.. If you don't need to display your real phone number,btohqsg
