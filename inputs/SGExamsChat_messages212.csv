"i think its a typo  ""I dont know""",btohqsg

Best  insights shared through relevant experience but refused despite lack of experience. Guys really don't have it worse la. I've seen plenty of examples where army/reservist connections you build that give you a leg up in your career. As sucky as NS is  the guys have more experience working in crappy work environments  which is an asset.,btohqsg
at least make bmt pay higher,btohqsg
a female into work for 2 year,btohqsg
if they earn like 4k a monthj,btohqsg
all boy not even max 1k a month for the 2 yr,btohqsg
can. the trade-off will then be higher taxes to fund the higher ns pay (it comes from taxes after all).,btohqsg
Then all the ORD adults will be salty that they pay more but never got higher pay as NSFs,btohqsg
no lah take away the mayor,btohqsg
well  the starting pay for a male would be higher than a lady's for the same job,btohqsg

Or join the ITP programme by MOE,btohqsg
But u can ask Ur sch teacher if they can let u teach Olympiad chem,btohqsg

But yea  try coorindate with Ur sec sch teacher,btohqsg

Thats the acronym for the booklet,btohqsg
Find it to be of any use,btohqsg
As in JC portion of sec sch Olympiad,btohqsg
"1 of the students I kind of ""taught"" is here",btohqsg

I didnt even see any from rv,btohqsg
"Go for it  then can add to ur portfolio for ""future gains""",btohqsg
But now also hard to find students le,btohqsg
i do think its quite competitive  but like as long as you speak with a genuine passion to teach i think it helps too,btohqsg
Not everything about portfolio bro haha,btohqsg
If I go into teaching with no intention of being a teacher,btohqsg
Which isn't fair for them haha,btohqsg
But I can only sign up for it two years later hahahahaha,btohqsg
Not as old as fuzzy tho,btohqsg
Thanks V  I will do that,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionwill like to speak with you.,btohqsg
But ya just go for TIP,btohqsg
Esp if the supervising teacher isnt in class,btohqsg
But of course  9 weeks feels like BMT,btohqsg
Just like how punishments are like,btohqsg
Dont do work = write 50 lines  or stand at the back of the class (but that only means you deduct 15 lines per class you stand for),btohqsg
"""I believe no one should be denied an education  and hence everyone will attend class and no one will be kicked out of the class""",btohqsg
When i gave them 2 options,btohqsg
I said option 1 can stand,btohqsg
Lol if i teach pri sch,btohqsg
And also if i ended up there,btohqsg
I will make sure i abuse you within my authority,btohqsg
Just another case on the list,btohqsg
Then i will see u standing for 9 weeks,btohqsg
Confirm will have ppl sleep one,btohqsg

He passed his chinese prelim lc,btohqsg
now calculate the probability of passing your exam using this method,btohqsg
P(passing my god damn exams using an eraser) = 1/2,btohqsg
that's just P(10 correct out of 20),btohqsg
passing includes 11  12  ...  20,btohqsg
and you didn't account for the combinations,btohqsg
11/20 is also considered a pass,btohqsg
Everytime i do probably i am very scared,btohqsg
Could easily be a D+ too,btohqsg
D+ no need dabao alr  be happy,btohqsg

thanks for trying to help tho@meltedmangofrappe,btohqsg
hiro nid some advice on whether to drop h2 econs or chem,btohqsg
It depends on what u want to take in Uni,btohqsg
if u dont want h2 chem,btohqsg
means uni u cant enter any science or chem-related course,btohqsg
dun rly hv a course in mind,btohqsg
why i said econs was cos u dont need h2 econs to study econs or econs related courses in uni,btohqsg
but is mostly engineering rite with the exception of med,btohqsg
Which he may not want to do in the first place,btohqsg
if no need i fear for any1 going polyclinics 5 yrs from now,btohqsg
later give paracetamol for cough  gg,btohqsg
wdf i can't find my new sticker pack,btohqsg
would say chem/econs both have their pros and cons,btohqsg
econs is more of logical thinking/understanding  chem is a bit content heavy/dry,btohqsg
but imo content is more heavy for econs,btohqsg
for me i found econs dry ah,btohqsg
but both is nid heavy mem work rite,btohqsg
Its literally the most relevant subject to ur life,btohqsg
No need to bump  none of our posts are bumped either,btohqsg
Like my econs tutor would say:Economics is just intuition made hard.,btohqsg
i worried the 25m essay qns gg sia,btohqsg
thn if nid application somemore i die,btohqsg
Theres almost no content diff between h1 and h2 econs,btohqsg
logically if i can master econs essay qns thn it's more worth to drop chem rite,btohqsg
The hard part about econs is how u approach the qn,btohqsg
My man literally just mentioned the 2 biggest topics in econs and said no diff,btohqsg
The difference is v small lah,btohqsg
harh thn sometimes the qn like confusing eh,btohqsg
u just finished o lvls is it,btohqsg
whether u enjoyed chem or econs more so far,btohqsg
and what u intend to do in future,btohqsg
So for econs  do u struggle more for essays or CSQs?,btohqsg
i also like u  dk what to do in future,btohqsg
high five  but my j1 chem quite shit,btohqsg
btw uk phy is like my worst subj,btohqsg
but i read its like not worth to drop,btohqsg
I can help with u that,btohqsg
cos apparently they focus more on explns,btohqsg
physics tbh has the least content,btohqsg
I can foresee u are gonna talk about ur phy in uni,btohqsg
ah he can psycho u not to drop his fav subject,btohqsg
but when i say dont drop chem....,btohqsg
ya plus h1 takes out stuff like g field which is actl kinda fun,btohqsg
just stick with 2 h2s ba,btohqsg
Every phy student knows QP is the most fun topic,btohqsg
hmm but theoretically speaking if i cld master essays thn drop chem will b worth ah,btohqsg
But didn't u said u like chem more,btohqsg
oh no bedok pissed off kumargod,btohqsg
And like dropping chem severly limits ur options,btohqsg
most content heavy shit i ever encountered,btohqsg
realistically dropping econs closes the least doors since u dont really need econs to do econs in uni,btohqsg
speaking of organic chem  its rly nothing compared to h2 bio or organic chem at higher levels,btohqsg
Dropping econs also least worth at the same time arh,btohqsg
diff between h2 and h1 rite,btohqsg
The drop in content is pretty little,btohqsg
Chem more manageable than bio in air level,btohqsg
Organic chem is literally 40-45% of the entire H2 chem syb,btohqsg
but the chance to do well is harder for h2 imo,btohqsg
h1 the cohort is generally not so good in econs  so if u are above avg  A/B is very easy to get,btohqsg
Isnt that true for all subs,btohqsg
humans dist rate always very low,btohqsg
i see h2 sciences ard 40-45% (except for chem),btohqsg
idk chem h1 lowest distinction rate rite,btohqsg
but thats not because its hard ba,btohqsg
its because of the cohort's standard,btohqsg
Math is the highest among all subjects lmao,btohqsg
Ya i meant i was talking about sciences,btohqsg
Its the easiest to score A in,btohqsg
Anyone got good h2 bio teacher,btohqsg
does ur sch still have cool blue/hot pink,btohqsg
i was 1 of the cohort leaders for that nonsense,btohqsg
can look on some of the tuition website,btohqsg
In uni became the other way round,btohqsg
me  but i give free lessons,btohqsg
but i personally dont use any tutor so idk anyone,btohqsg
But phy is still relatively mush easier to score,btohqsg
its like a weekly night study session in j2,btohqsg
Any tutors want a chem tutor to teach them? üòÇ,btohqsg
Ya they have snack and shit,btohqsg
they will get a teacher there,btohqsg
i will be a full time tutor if i no NS,btohqsg
full time refers to ppl who graduate from uni and teach tuition only,btohqsg
i thot max is 90 HAHAHA,btohqsg
Ah help how to do well,btohqsg
and how old ar eu now,btohqsg
idk   i dont use any tutor at all but i see alot of people using tutors nowadays,btohqsg
im not getting any new intakes,btohqsg
maybe they all went tuition centres,btohqsg
all in the same bio tuition,btohqsg
den in class they talking about their,btohqsg
i can lowkey imagine my grp tuition students doin the same in sch,btohqsg
Which chapter bio is most challenging?,btohqsg
Tot tat one is common sense?,btohqsg
Lao niang got tiger teacher now,btohqsg
