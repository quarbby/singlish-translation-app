It can be done... You need to write in to LTA  they will ask for photos of the crack  then if they will give permission to weld  and also tell what you cannot do like cut the pipe and weld. After welded send new photos they will arrange a date to come a take photos of your car and do sound test. All ok your new photos will be in the system,btohqsg
