This Eindec is getting interesting. Closed with a bullish engulfing pattern n price  end up at the edge of the triangle. Resistance at 104 on chart. Friday day end matching also saw someone don't wanna let it close above 104. MACD histogram still turning up in the positive zone. This is an ang mo candle setup with a potential target of 132. I see more upside this week. If Monday open at least 105 then high chance will go above 110.,btohqsg
For medtecs holders. This chart not updated one. Price till Thursday but still usable. The uptrend trendline is the last critical support. Broke this line probably is sayonara already. Take note that there's a bearish pattern formed. Not saying that price will definitely toh. But if price close below the trendline  I think it's safer to exit... Dyodd. Just my 2-cents.,btohqsg
Am i right to say that medtecs is a high risk stock now.,btohqsg
This is Gordon Goh Wei Xue aka Equanimity,btohqsg
