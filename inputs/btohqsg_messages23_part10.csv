Will try to ask them again,btohqsg
They may give v vague answers (like they did for me) so ultimately just submit what you can for HFE and cross your fingersWeijie,btohqsg
Are married couples allowed to get 2 room flexi lol,btohqsg
yes. must be 99 year lease,btohqsg
May I know how to check the balance/ availability of the flat units for current bto selection? TIA,btohqsg
Hi guys  question hereIf overall number applications within flat supply but application rate for second timers is high  like maybe 10x or 20x  does it mean everyone still gets a number or?,btohqsg
Over sub alr Tampines and Holland,btohqsg
Only up to 3x will get number,btohqsg
If looking at teban 5 room  first timer 0.3x  second timer 7.3x  how? lol,btohqsg
They will give queue number for 3x the number of available units for 2nd timers (ie 5%),btohqsg
Wah ok that answers my question. Sad for me,btohqsg
Pre set filter :) unfortunately we can't add more as no rights given  so thanks to those who alert us by reporting and do continue to do so,btohqsg
Correct. HLE was the same too. Was just sharing my anecdotal experience,btohqsg
Anyone applied HLE in may and haven't received,btohqsg
Safer or officially  applicant should just assume 12 months income assessment is needed for EHGA lady from another group shared that she was employed for the entire assessment period during HLE era but didn't get the grant because no income when she was on unpaid leave for a few months,btohqsg
Definitely assume strict guidelines as stated!Prepare for the worst but hope for the best ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Wait I donâ€™t understand. So basically we need to be at least employed FT for 12 months then we will get the grants? Then what do they mean by the cut off date of the income assessment period is two month before an applicant applies for an HFE letter?,btohqsg
By right  applicant should be employed for 12 months to qualify for grantCut off date 2 months before application -If you apply for HFE in September this year  income documents required should be from August 2023 to July 2024If you apply for HFE in February next year  income documents required should be from January 2024 to December 2024,btohqsg
Anyway  people are usually more concerned about loans rather than the grantApplicant doesn't have to be employed for full 12 months to be eligible for loan,btohqsg
Hmm I see  cause actually as I mention before. My partner starts work on 1 Nov last year so technically if Iâ€™m assuming based on this current June launch  the application dates are usually towards the mid/end of the month. So which is actually like only a few days apart from my partner 12 month employment mark. So was just wondering if HDB will allow us to resubmit to show the proof etc.,btohqsg
Yes loans as well! Can I check how do they calculate how much loan we can take?,btohqsg
How to calculate loan eligibility  i have no ideaHopefully there are others in the group who can share some insightsEHG is more transparent  the table can be found online and people can usually estimate from there based on their income situation,btohqsg
1 Nov to this June isn't 12 months though...?,btohqsg
im looking to apply for the oct launch,btohqsg
"Apologies  did not realise you weren't aware of this.Yes  basic criteria of grants is 12 months continuous employment.My experience was the ""by left"" ""case by case"" success. Not the norm yea",btohqsg
Got it. In that case you would be applying for HFE in Sep  which is closer to 12 months but also not 12 months,btohqsg
Can I just confirm with u guys if this is right? If Iâ€™m under staggered downpayment.1st appt: option fee based on room type2nd appt: 2.5% downpayment3rd appt: key collection + 17.5% downpaymentThen the remaining amt has to be paid by cash plus housing loan right?,btohqsg
Tats why Iâ€™m wondering how would hdb actually counts,btohqsg
My point still stands to try luck and submit what you can (though of course case by case),btohqsg
If they donâ€™t accept it  means that they will deferred income assessment and only access income before key collection right?,btohqsg
If start work in November last year  it will be 12 months only in October this yearMeaning  if want to submit all 12 months income documents to be considered for grant  you apply for HFE in DecemberMaybe can try to appeal  write in to HDBNot saying it will definitely work but usually government agencies will try to help somehow (methinks),btohqsg
Deferred income applies if you BOTH meet the criteria  see below,btohqsg
As u mention that many actually are more worried about the housing loan. I went to check and they say housing loan only can be up to 80% of the house value and of course it depends on ur income level also right? If letâ€™s say hdb is unable to lend me the full remaining amt which means need to pay by cash. Do I need to upfront pay the rest or ?,btohqsg
There is criteria to qualify for deferred assessmentNot that people can apply for deferred assessment,btohqsg
Ahhh  appeal from their e services link or is there a particular email to it?,btohqsg
You need to pay the remainder by key collection,btohqsg
That's the only way to write in to them,btohqsg
Can be paid by cpf or cash only?,btohqsg
For #1  either a or b#2 onwards yes must fulfill all,btohqsg
I know the 17.5% can be paid by cpf,btohqsg
Mmm that I'm not sure sorry,btohqsg
Wa tricky sia HAHAH cuz Iâ€™m considered as just graduated from university this August but my partner ORD last year 30 Sep! So does it means we are not eligible for it omgðŸŒš,btohqsg
Since flat application would be in Oct...yeah :/,btohqsg
Wait then does it means we wonâ€™t have any grantsðŸ˜±,btohqsg
Cost of flat - grant - CPF payment - loan = remainder pay by cash,btohqsg
Grants will need to see case by case basis  though technically you wouldn't qualify (based on 12 month criteria)I think as what Cher said  you should also think about loans  unless both of you are already/will alr be working by the time you apply for HFE?,btohqsg
Yes we are working FT alr,btohqsg
But itâ€™s just we havenâ€™t reach the 12th month mark,btohqsg
But impossible they donâ€™t access any income also if we r not under the deferred income assessment scheme right?,btohqsg
If you're intent on applying for Oct launch  then you will need to be prepared for no grants. If your finances can manage that  then go for it,btohqsg
