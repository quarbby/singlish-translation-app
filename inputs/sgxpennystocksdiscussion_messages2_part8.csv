H2 confirm better then H1 . Bec first quarter not yet covid full impact . Is Q3 better than Q2? I think this is more important,btohqsg
The question is will one sell if the price go up when H2 results released?,btohqsg
In between also will have many movements,btohqsg
Same as TG when get selled down to 2 dollars everyone say funds exited,btohqsg

Drop for a while then go up,btohqsg
Sekali VP end of this year $3.88...hohoho... Tmr load more...,btohqsg
There are many that are caught high in their stocks,btohqsg
The question is when reach your EP will you sell off or will greed overcome you?,btohqsg

52 weeks Low $0.027. $1.26/0.027. 46 times,btohqsg
Very funny one  when ppl never see the next results will hesitate with the price,btohqsg
Then BB will fry up and down,btohqsg
Nvm.. Just one hr late.. Was buying at 0.032 end up shot up to 0.041,btohqsg
Until the results announce all chiong in again,btohqsg

Although Tw medtec price is now $2.19 sgd . But their % growth is same as sg. 47 times . So I think cannot say sg MT price Low,btohqsg
Can only sell at 0.042..the sell queue at 0.043 too thick..,btohqsg
Wonder if anyone ever think from this aspect ...,btohqsg
We don't compare long ago already establish TW and Sg no correlation,btohqsg
