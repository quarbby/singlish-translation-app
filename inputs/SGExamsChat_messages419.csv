Unless you‚Äôre a student. Still feel that its more valuable  especially if its more durable.,btohqsg
its eating a potato and cleaning it,btohqsg
Its not that expensive if you don‚Äôt buy directly from the Apple brand.,btohqsg
then selling the clean potato to uni kids,btohqsg
and then repeating the cycle until you dont gotta work,btohqsg
What potato and are you still trolling me,btohqsg
From experience? It is that bad.,btohqsg
u eat potatos and watch data,btohqsg
I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again  get an iPhone please.,btohqsg
I use a Samsung tablet too for the record  even alongside an iPhone,btohqsg
explain the watch data please neko,btohqsg
wagyu beef w straight from harvest potatoes,btohqsg

I took a few months to decide between the tablets,btohqsg
The big thing for me is I love the S Pen lol,btohqsg
what's this group chat for ?,btohqsg
I heard that its easily broken.,btohqsg
Why‚Äôs it better than the Apple Pencil,btohqsg
it's not better per se. they are just different,btohqsg
hard tip vs soft tip for one,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt you just change different tips for Apple Pencil,btohqsg
fuck this chi is my mother tongue lang idc,btohqsg
It doesn't work the same way,btohqsg
The apple pencil feels like I'm writing on a piece of paper on a hard table. The S pen feels like I'm writing on a notebook,btohqsg
there is that little bit of give,btohqsg
it's ok  my helper calls me gemuk,btohqsg
Now I want to experience the difference.,btohqsg
write on a piece of paper on a table then write on a notebook,btohqsg
yea hard tip is better for drawing stuff,btohqsg
but I mainly use my Huion for drawing,btohqsg
except for that random pocoyo doodle i did a while back,btohqsg
but yea my gf has an iPad and she also finds that writing on my tablet is a lot more elegant,btohqsg
When do I get a doodle in my honour,btohqsg
Okay  how many people do I know that draws as a hobby?,btohqsg
ok tbf  the pocoyo one was just out of pure boredom,btohqsg
Excuse you. I demand one eventually.,btohqsg
Just doodle something that represents and embodies what my persona suggests idk how art works.,btohqsg
This. I got my tutor to do once upon a time.,btohqsg
Google. Or  I can ask around for you.,btohqsg
Wait  I can‚Äôt ask Mel  she uses a Wacom,btohqsg

And ppl are literally fighting to work there,btohqsg
Everyone should experience working with f&b at least once,btohqsg
Right but don't ever work at fast food chains,btohqsg
A socially anxious persons worst nightmare,btohqsg
4 pumps of frap roastThen fill up milk of your desired choice to the first lineThen 2 pumps of bar mochaThen iceThen 4 pumps of coffee flavoured syrupThen blend,btohqsg

"(totally did not acci memorise ur name as ""sihui"" and told angela ""sihui_eh wait si- si what oya siyan"")",btohqsg

Get well soon  and try more medicine and hydrate more.,btohqsg
Lol I received a spam email of someone pretending to be my supervisor,btohqsg
Its so obviously with their typos.,btohqsg
PI is the term given for the researcher in charge of the research group,btohqsg
I mean yes but it also went into my school email junk,btohqsg
That‚Äôs your punishment for making a conscious decision to drink on a school night.,btohqsg
And so stop texting us and paying attention?,btohqsg
i finally finished superposition theorem (after so many days of procrastinating),btohqsg
procrastinated but still got it done,btohqsg
ofc ofc   I have still another 5 months till poly starts  what's procrastination,btohqsg
yes  physics is love physics is life,btohqsg
you wait. That 5 months gonna become 5 days,btohqsg
When are you going to be proud of me,btohqsg
I still don‚Äôt get why she took bio in the first place.,btohqsg
den wat am I supposed to compare,btohqsg
omg I love my sec2 grades I barely passed,btohqsg
technically I got A2 (including bellcurve) but bellcurve exists,btohqsg
so I still need to make the cut for that course,btohqsg
Hallo getting into the course isn't what I deem as successful.,btohqsg
It's when I put my max effort into it  that's when I consider something successful,btohqsg
‚ÄúWhy the 1 for 1‚Äù very short timing,btohqsg
Should have said ‚Äúcos we are underpaid to do this sh*t and we are tired from making too much drinks‚Äù,btohqsg
tell them  you're alr here so might as well buy now rite,btohqsg
They probably rushed to get the 1 for 1,btohqsg
ok nah im not gonna say it,btohqsg
wait fuck idk how to structure it,btohqsg
Never mind it ended yesterday already,btohqsg
I forgot how many pumps is toffee nut syrup sia for toffee nut latte,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok I can put the whole bottle of syrup then you drink it,btohqsg
And you have to cut your leg like that,btohqsg
speaking of  NTU late with my stipend again,btohqsg
is it advisable to stay in dorm considering that ntu is ulu,btohqsg
and idw ghost I legit scared,btohqsg
yk the thing is I don't see ghost but my imaginations are insane,btohqsg
what i do.. call them old fuck. I mean technically they're THAT old considering they're dead,btohqsg
as much as im a monkey myself  I don't want to come home to find my room in a mess,btohqsg
I'd recommend staying for at least 1 sem/1 year for the experience. plus you'd explore more of the campus if you stay,btohqsg
monkeys you'll cnfm see them around  but for you room it's only an issue if you leave with your windows wide open,btohqsg
wild boar hardly see tbh. i've seen them like once in my years,btohqsg
you can try going for those rooms with attached toilet. more ex but at least no need go outside at night,btohqsg
eh for first year  unless you know people to rec you in  is really pure luck,btohqsg
you can reject after getting allocated the room though  so no harm applying,btohqsg
i'd help but i'd legit finish my phd alr by the time she start uni,btohqsg
i'll have to get outside experience first still,btohqsg
anyway she also would be in diff faculty,btohqsg
that I have non zero odds of becoming a prof to some people here,btohqsg
yea  my pay but stipends don't count as income,btohqsg
Really? I‚Äôll have to ask my tutor‚Äôs brother  since he goes to nus med year 1  and his older brother is going to ntu med year 1.,btohqsg
@kohsyanwhy when I go out to the pool it always drizzles,btohqsg
What do you get paid for,btohqsg
Its thunderstorming  what are you talking about?,btohqsg
we live same area and it's drizzling,btohqsg
just not fated to go out,btohqsg
but pls stop. your weather affects me too,btohqsg
What about when you‚Äôre in then,btohqsg
They both stay in dorms iirc  because they live in somewhere else lmao.,btohqsg
and i mean don't leave shit a monkey would want out lol,btohqsg
he's exhausted his bad luck for the decade,btohqsg
it's actually not even drizzling here rn,btohqsg
Wouldn‚Äôt being prof mean that you still have to publish papers and stuff on top of supervising,btohqsg
Could happen  but much less common. I've never had any monkey incidents despite living in an area with many,btohqsg
Higher floors are better for that tho,btohqsg
To be a student and making progress in my research,btohqsg
You get paid to be a PhD student and do research? Living the dream student life rn.,btohqsg
You should never be paying a cent to do a PhD. Some people get paid a little through teaching but never out of pocket,btohqsg
and I realised this isn't our pms,btohqsg
Switzerland and Netherlands sound fun. Germany sounds like it could be fun  minus the pain of German  but that could be because I only learned German profanities in sec 2.,btohqsg
Then why are you standing there in the drizzle,btohqsg
That implies that she has the ability to think before she uses profanities or swear words.,btohqsg
PhDs should always be funded either by scholarship (mine) or assistantship (paid to teach or extra research),btohqsg
Like what Kuro said  wait what? Why would they get paid never out of pocket? I‚Äôm confused.,btohqsg
it‚Äôs fundamentally different from a masters in that sense,btohqsg
I‚Äôd say at least 80% of PhD students are funded,btohqsg
Of course you got a genius funded scholarship.,btohqsg
the genius funded one is the NPGS  which has 2 people in each faculty awarded it,btohqsg
self funded then  but it‚Äôs really not recommended and in some cases you aren‚Äôt even allowed to,btohqsg
wait guys I have a qn,btohqsg
I mean in some countries  a PhD can go on for many many years,btohqsg
if you get a scholarship   does ur household income matter? or is it just bursary there's a limit,btohqsg
do you really want a student to pay that much for an indefinite amount of time? and If they can‚Äôt they‚Äôd be wasting the university‚Äôs resources,btohqsg
but some scholarships do cater towards lower income households,btohqsg
but generally it doesn't matter rite,btohqsg
so it's impossible to get a merit bursary for someone who's household income is higher than shown ah,btohqsg
or u can have the award just that no money,btohqsg
and it‚Äôs a lot of paperwork tbh,btohqsg
moe one is 6.9k or 1.7k + per person,btohqsg
scholarship is just apply  interviews  get accepted  you accept,btohqsg
I mean NTU bursary let me get it for household income lower than 9k. Small amount but yes,btohqsg
Some people take 7-8 years for it,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt tell me that you just woke up? And if you did  I‚Äôll lecture you.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm assuming sgs full unsubsidised rate of 25k or so annually,btohqsg
even so that‚Äôs a lot of money,btohqsg
Oi y is this nickname spreading,btohqsg
Medical school is 61k per semester.,btohqsg
ill only be 30 mins l8 but me n my bois use that time to otot project,btohqsg
Without a bond and at nus.,btohqsg
but i need do finish pwd,btohqsg
Who asked you to wake up so late? Hm? I don‚Äôt have to give you a lecture  your lateness is punishment enough.,btohqsg
@meowskerswas even late when asking me to crash her class,btohqsg
lowkey imagine being one of the people who comes for class l8 but your lec always recognises u cuz u come class for the more impt thing  asking abt the proj rather than just sleeping in class,btohqsg
that one i attending resume writing talk,btohqsg
i ended my sess 1 hr early for u ok,btohqsg
espresso rhymer cannot make up for tt,btohqsg
side note  if anyone wanna crash a Nobel laureate's talk in Jan  lmk heh,btohqsg
Its a punishment enough for you.,btohqsg
He created a model that I just did a finals on,btohqsg
i see if my exam more impt or this,btohqsg
The only quantum ik is finance,btohqsg
And even that sounds like mumbo jumbo,btohqsg
clearly qUantUrM is more impt right,btohqsg
If he doesn‚Äôt  watch me do it.,btohqsg
i respect only my 2 laoda,btohqsg
As much as I am honored I feel u are misplacing ur respect,btohqsg
I believe so  but there are plenty of seminars we tend to have that are online,btohqsg
As much as I like myself I dont think the world needs more of me,btohqsg
Sure the world wld be better off if more ppl are physically active,btohqsg
Sad. I would crash if it were online.,btohqsg
on a srs note holy fk that's scary,btohqsg
I hv a fren who drives in racing competition in Thailand,btohqsg

Someone posted a snippet of their result above....i see  well here is mine when i was in sec 3(2019),btohqsg
I went from A1 to F9,btohqsg
31P NMR  roult  clausius clapeyron  grignard  MO  CFT  nernst triangle  steady state,btohqsg
i hope the sec 3's results here aint like mine,btohqsg
I forgot what came out lol   too many,btohqsg
But electrochemKeto enol tautSn and E ( i forgot exactly)StabilityNeighbouring group participationNmr,btohqsg
Ya no have. Nmr came out but it was assigning values only. Not elucidation,btohqsg
I was trynna prove these ppl who don't believe I failed math,btohqsg
i totally did not 100% it 2 years ago,btohqsg
anyone wants to play with me pc version,btohqsg
or it takes two oso can,btohqsg
i'd have played it takes two if my gf didn't have a mac,btohqsg
not a lot of time nowadays oops,btohqsg
anyone plays world of tanks blitz,btohqsg
I deleted it for more storage space.,btohqsg
Big drawback of Mac if you like games,btohqsg
Also for example  overcooked 2 is playable on mac but not the first overcooked,btohqsg
I played sims and overcooked 2 just fine on there.,btohqsg
Not that big of a drawback if you‚Äôre not a seriously avid gamer.,btohqsg
don't have to be an avid gamer to like games,btohqsg
there is a serious big difference in what's supported on those two OSs,btohqsg
It works fine for me  but then again  I‚Äôve a really old MacBook Pro so.,btohqsg
I mean your sample size of games is very small,btohqsg
If it's a supported game  then it runs fine,btohqsg
If it's unsupported  you flat out can't run it,btohqsg
is there anyone here that goes to Math Academia Amath tuition?,btohqsg
I definitely didn‚Äôt do anything heavy like csgo  because my laptop is just an ancient slow potato by now.,btohqsg
and i'm an even older one so,btohqsg
My MA just learnt how to say wuck you in Chinese.,btohqsg
Fair. for perspective  Valve (though not the greatest developer) in 2018 got over 2000 Windows only games running for Linux,btohqsg
Save me. Its not me who taught her because I barely can formulate a sentence in Chinese  let alone use profanities correctly.,btohqsg
I mean yea  I just know many people who love their macs for everything good about them but just get sad at how many games they can't play lol,btohqsg
I actually am an avid apple fan  but one of the more controversial opinions that I have is that I actually prefer my older surface pro laptop over my MacBook Pro  because the user interface of the OS is easier to navigate and less restrictive in terms of the programs that I can run on it successfully. Idk if that‚Äôs necessarily true  what do you guys think?,btohqsg
I mean MacOS is inherently more restrictive and exclusive,btohqsg
that's kind of how their brand is,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know what is the full form. I didn‚Äôt even know that it is a profanity of my dialect until now.,btohqsg
If you want us to tell you,btohqsg
you'll have to give swearing permission,btohqsg
Yeah  it took like forever for me to figure out a totally not legal photoshop program that would run on it.,btohqsg
it really depends on what is needed. The specs of laptops nowadays are so high  that a basic one <$500 is sufficient for most uses,btohqsg
idek what my laptop specs is now lol,btohqsg
20 years ago  the specs are really important.Nowadays  unless you are into graphics design and video editing  not really needed,btohqsg
in fact  even graphics and video editing can be done via the cloud  and the processing power needed is not even on your own computer,btohqsg
When do we ever do just documentation,btohqsg
Yeah  but when do we ever just use it for that,btohqsg
$2.8k gives you extra 2 TB on google drive for 20 years,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt even used YouTube in 6 years.,btohqsg
You can even do quantum computing on the cloud,btohqsg
eg  I use the software Flixier. It does video processing for me in the cloud when I need it,btohqsg
you only really need the internet,btohqsg
You can buy a 2TB SSD for under $300,btohqsg
Depends on how important you treat your data  as well as how private it is,btohqsg
people i know have bad chromebook experiences,btohqsg
For me  I need backup on data for all the digital photoshoots of my kids and family.I also need backup on data for all the materials I use for lessons.A $300 SSD is too risky to keep it,btohqsg
Typical lifespan of SSD is 5 years. Assume just for backup  extend to 10 years.And assuming there is never an accident. Then yes  $600,btohqsg
I worked in the semiconductor industry before,btohqsg
the failures of SSDs is typically not its storage cells  but on the on-off side.,btohqsg
