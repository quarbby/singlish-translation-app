What card to use for ipaymy to pay mortgage?,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre going to use iPayMy  do not use UOB cards as they‚Äôre excluded.I do want to caution that I heard rumours that iPayMy will also cut visa from loans repayment üòÖPersonally I‚Äôm using DBS Vantage at the moment but don‚Äôt go rushing to apply for one if you don‚Äôt have it already. Wait a few days for iPayMy to announce if they‚Äôre also cutting visa from loan repayments,btohqsg
I did some initial studies on which MC to use for loans payment using CardUp/iPayMy and came up with Citi Prestige or OCBC 90N MC as they both offer 1.3mpd.Any masters here know if these two cards have been excluded from loans repayments?,btohqsg
Anyone here still hold snack investment? Should we withdraw now? My amount now almost back to capital paid,btohqsg
Thanks bros for fast responses! Looks like UOB PriviMiles MC 1.4mpd is the best followed by OCBC 90N MC 1.3mpd,btohqsg
Hi guys. Can I check with you guys. I registered my premium miles citi card on amaze. And spent $600 so far using gpay tagged to instarem tagged to my citi premium miles. But when I checked citi they say the miles I earned this month is 0?,btohqsg
Wait fr it to be posted?,btohqsg
Wa thx for the heads up,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre using iPayMy  just use your non-UOB visa to setup for a long stream of payments for loans and pray they only cut new requests hahaI did that yesterday just in case got chance they will honor those payments that have already been setup.,btohqsg
No one is stopping them from discarding all your future payments.,btohqsg
Agreed. CardUp did it. It‚Äôs more roll dice and hope.,btohqsg
Hi all  just checking if it's still worth it to use ipaymy/cardup with a processing fee to be pay for yearly insurance premium. Roughly 2.8k. Or HSBC EGA 1% cashback ultimately will be better?,btohqsg
how about getting 1% for giro payment of the cc bill for the ipaymy/ cardup transaction,btohqsg
What's ur value of mile? Can't answer without knowing that.,btohqsg
means technically I am paying only 0.85% of the fee instead of 1.85% for monthly recurring. Can i understand that correct,btohqsg
Try cardup calculatorhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/214296Not sure which card you are using but likely more than 1.5 cents per mile.,btohqsg
can i also understand that it will be better to go for monthly rather than yearly. Cause the monthly fee charges is lower   +EGA + rewards? Just wanted confirm my understanding is correct. Pls correct me if i'm wrong . Thanks all üòÄ,btohqsg
You might want to double check. Are you sure monthly is cheaper? It's insurance.,btohqsg
for the premium yearly definitely will be cheaper around 20-50 annually between few policy.,btohqsg
I suggest you check by %  don't see based on flat number.,btohqsg
hey! anyone'sbooking.comlink not working on heymax?,btohqsg
Got same issue. Maybe ask on heymax chat.,btohqsg
CardUp will no longer process mortgage and car loan repayments on Visa/UnionPay credit cards effective 1st November 2024.Any cards to recommend for car loan via cardup,btohqsg
Hi if i will to pay for oversea hotel using agoda website with uob prvimiles   i will earn 6miles per dollar correct? Anything i need to check or be aware? Thanks,btohqsg
1. Need a special landing site. Price may be higher and not worth the 6mpd.2. 6mpd will only be credited after ur stay. I personally didn't get my 6mpd for my stay in Jan.,btohqsg
May I also check at what % difference can I call it a shot that ipaymy or cardup is more worth it? Hahaha. Or eg difference is 3-4% than ipay is more worth it or no. Sorry still a little confused üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi experts  Can I know if I spend $1.5k on phone purchases using citi rewards + Amaze card  does it mean that $1000 I get the maximum points/Miles then the balance of $500 I don‚Äôt get anything?,btohqsg

Hi gurus  just want to check if the UOB FX+ card is better than youtrip?,btohqsg
Ops.. I didn't know got this function,btohqsg
hello  here it said ipaymy acceptes UOB PRVI Miles World Mastercard  https://help.ipaymy.com/en/articles/3153490-which-cards-can-earn-rewards-with-ipaymy,btohqsg
You can try. Or you can see the correct info from UOB own t&cs. Basically what ipaymy also stated in their site.,btohqsg
UOB exclusions (bit outdated cuz missing amaze).Ipaymy can take UOB cards but it doesn't mean you will earn miles.,btohqsg
The rewards are given by banks not cardup  hence  better to read the TnC from bank but not cardup.,btohqsg
Hello  would like to seek advice on which cards i should get based on my current scenario. Currently i don't own any credit card  but i have a big purchase coming up which is furnitures and electrical appliances. Would probably spend around 18k ringgit for furnitures and around 15k sgd in singapore. Which cards is recommended for the best value for miles?Thanks in advance! üôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg
MYR: Maybank World Mastercard (3.2 mpd)SGD: DBS Vantage (1.5 mpd) if you're willing to pay the AF  otherwise UOB PRVI (1.4 mpd),btohqsg
If you want to just pool in one card then use UOB PRVI (3 mpd for MYR  1.4 mpd for SGD),btohqsg
Unfortunely i‚Äôm unable to get maybank world mastercard due to the minimum income,btohqsg
Did you watch the 2 videos yet?,btohqsg
