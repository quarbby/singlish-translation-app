Myanmar girl still dancing.... No worries,btohqsg
Hahaha this is the 20 lane expressway at Naypyidaw right,btohqsg

Ya haha. Before coronavirus  my last trip was to Uzbekistan 😂,btohqsg
Their version of briyani (pilav) jin ho jiak man,btohqsg
Cos you know tourist mah  then they treat you v v well,btohqsg
My whole Uzbek trip I spent S$1.2k for 8* days. And $800 was for the flight sia,btohqsg
The flight usually $400+ one. But I delay and delay then in the end suck thumb pay high price,btohqsg
I highly recommend  but now they got no direct flight from Changi alr. Must fly thru KL or JKT,btohqsg
Oo interesting.. I wanna go Kazakhstan one day  their building design looks very interesting,btohqsg
Ya I had wanted to go too  but no time cos I was still in NS. Cannot take much leave. But Kazakhstan fly there damn blardy ex,btohqsg
And domestic transport also not cheap. Almaty to Astana the high speed train almost half a day  and costs hundreds,btohqsg
I took the HSR in Uzbekistan from Tashkent to Bukhara  not even US$30 I think. From Khiva to Tashkent back by flight  also ard US$40,btohqsg
Wah need save up liao haha 😆,btohqsg
Usually to Kazakhstan ppl fly thru South Korea I think,btohqsg
Last time the viable way was to fly to Tashkent from SG direct  then take a car into Almaty cos Tashkent near the border,btohqsg
Welcome to the MT Happy Family! Staying for long? =D,btohqsg

Ya unfortunately only 1 Stan. If I had more time I would have tried gg to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan,btohqsg
Definitely. On my bucket list 😂 but to be honest  my 'fire' for travelling also diminished somewhat alr. If I don't travel I can save more money,btohqsg
Unlikely. 3 weeks more to go though.,btohqsg
Haha then after that see you back in again in May? 😁,btohqsg
Dunno real or suan ppl that buys MT cos result coming out soon...but if its real...huat ah,btohqsg
What’s there to suan lolIt’s an opportunistic play,btohqsg
Yeah like my friend who despised MT,btohqsg
Always say MT only worth 20 to 40 cents,btohqsg
He upset he miss the boat?,btohqsg
than last nov before announce results  he contra 100K to buy a few days before and sold for 7k profit,btohqsg

Anyway it’s been great knowing u guys. Will be leaving this group since seems to have lost the point. Know where to find me though. Cheers,btohqsg

GameStop frenzy: MAS warns of risks in trading fuelled by online discussionsFebruary 02  2021 7:43 PMSINGAPORE - Investors should be on heightened alert to risks related to securities trading fuelled by online discussion forums and social media chat groups.Read more:https://bit.ly/2MJMtyO,btohqsg
Now they can call it pump and dump or whatever but fact of the matter is that bb use their power to stop people from buying the share.. only can sell how to maintain let alone increase price.. this one is good example that stock market is controlled by big $$.. follow the big $$ dont go against it,btohqsg
Sadly some lives might be lost after this,btohqsg
Hope they go for counselling...money can be earned back,btohqsg
Maybe he only have one share leh,btohqsg
Haha i thought he is channel admin.,btohqsg
I see his name still in the member list,btohqsg
Is it some argument about Mt?,btohqsg
I think that’s the US stock discussion,btohqsg
China Star Food has formed a bullish pennant pattern. PA showed well absorbed at 47 on a T+4. More upside expected.,btohqsg
Marco Polo ($0.018/$0.019)It touched recent high of $0.025 on 21st Jan 2021 and retraced back to strong support level ($0.017-$0.018). We can see lower prices rejection from the lower wicks at $0.017.Good closing today at $0.018 after hidden buying power came in back at $0.017 and then cleared $0.018.The late action today shows that they might be coming back in play and reversal back up from this downtrend.Good luck  DYODD.Market is shaky now. We have to react accordingly if things don’t go to plan.,btohqsg
CFM Holdings warns of higher net loss for H1 2021https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/cfm-holdings-warns-of-higher-net-loss-for-h1-2021METAL-STAMPING firm CFM Holdings expects to record a higher net loss after tax for the half-year ended Dec 31  due to a decline in gross profit margin  it said in a filing to the Singapore Exchange on Tuesday.,btohqsg
Nope . I am not bro. U?,btohqsg
Just some news for CFM holders or planning to hold CFM long term.,btohqsg
Most Penny stocks should not be for long term.Once pennies music stop  many will be in freezer.,btohqsg
Long term counters  really need those that give dividends then at least it makes sense to buy up. 💪🏼,btohqsg
Hope energy and gloves uptrend continue tommorow.,btohqsg
Don’t think they will lose too much too. Couple millions . Not too bad .  Many other pennies lose A lot more but still can be fried up. Ultimately   as long as no suspension and BBs select them to play   they can be played up,btohqsg
Most importantly is cannot have debt issues. cFM gearing is little high at 75% but not yet cause for concern as they have Low float 200 million shares  they need money can always raise more.,btohqsg
Why our oiles hardly run today. Bb Sian liao?,btohqsg
I bought Rex by instinct today 😋,btohqsg
My exact sentiments with dax bro John,btohqsg
A lot of companies lose a lot more money and BBs still play them.For pennies   BBs presence is more important than the FA.,btohqsg
Costs high due to supply chain increased prices.A lot of suppliers are raising prices now due to increased freight rates by Shipping / logistics,btohqsg
Am more worried about market overall sentiments than minor business losses.If sentiments can recover  BBs play and nothing much to worry.Today late afternoon got some play ups. Hoping it is to ready up tomorrow then that’s good for us all,btohqsg
Yea man  take is easy. The losses is expected. COVID19 period . Many companies not doing well.Pennies playing by rank is1) sentiments2) spotting BBs3) PA4) TA5) FAAs long as no money issues and have SL  can play any counters,btohqsg
Sea ltd 250 go go go ,btohqsg
min order for material meaning it’s their downstream suppliers that are imposing those MOQ which is no surprise especially in their industry.... so even tho they’re generating more revenue from their lower operating cost  their incurred higher cost of goods from purchasing more materials than they should outweighs the revenue i guess...,btohqsg
“...attributable to an increase in cost of sales from minimum-order requirements for material purchases  tooling and tooling material purchases  higher direct labour costs as well as sub-contract services for its metal stamping operations...”the minimum order requirements comes from their downstream of the supply chain- meaning they probably only need to buy 10pcs of stamping tools in the past but now there’s a e.g. MOQ of 50pcs from their source  they’ve to follow and buy 50pcs instead OR  buy lesser but incur higher unit cost.^at least this is my unds from the BT article that youve shared.anyway it is what it is lor the article quite plain and direct liao.,btohqsg
cos something that i’m a bit familiar with and hope to help you shed some light on your doubts with my minimal knowledge 🤪,btohqsg
They have more inventory now it seems .,btohqsg
it’s very common to have MOQ. Cant expect a machine to operate to produce 1 tool only. need to maximise your machine’s capacity as well haha,btohqsg
hahaha in this economy.... everybody also wanna tan jiak one....,btohqsg
The MOQ is on tools ? Or raw material items. If so they more of it and should add to their inventory.More costs incurred for now but the following quarter might not need to incur.So it doesn’t seem so bad,btohqsg
See how they play tomorrow and react accordingly will do bro.,btohqsg
you dyodd ah i’m only explaining on the supply chain part idk about their financials much but to me warning of higher net loss doesn’t sound like good news..... so u agar agar lor,btohqsg
Already on my watchlist. Only thing is need to see whether BBs come to play .,btohqsg
I concentrate on my existing counters for now.,btohqsg
the last time they also warn of higher net loss for FY20 so not the first time.... next day gapped down 6 pips too.,btohqsg
now GME on Short Sell Restricted list,btohqsg
i bought a little bit for fun to join history moment,btohqsg
Day low 74. Alr up 59,btohqsg

This was recent? I thought q a while alr,btohqsg
I think they restrict until 3rd Feb right?,btohqsg
i serach online  it was on friday closing,btohqsg
Which in US time means tmr  not today,btohqsg
saw thisJust an FYI: this happens to any stock automatically when there’s a loss ( even because of blatant market manipulation) bigger than 10% against the value of yesterday’s closing price,btohqsg
yup. but if today positive  tomorrow they can short again,btohqsg
to see 10k 20k wall drop like water  is fun,btohqsg
I thought you were referring to trading halts,btohqsg
I see Sgyuan chart for GME I shiat bricks 😂,btohqsg

Not just rh  tiger  ig  ib also,btohqsg
Another green green day in US💪💪💪,btohqsg
Sentiments should be decent for SGX market   especially pennies as they had a late buy up. Should have some continuation play,btohqsg
Morning bro.... Yup today should be a follow thru from yesterday... But as always don't get carried away and play within your means💪💪💪especially newbies in the market,btohqsg
Yesterday late buy up plays in pennies looks like they are prepping for some pennies action today as most have been sidelines and watching after drop in pennies prices last week.US closed green on back to back and that should aid some positive market sentiments.Expecting a good day for pennies.We will know soon enough.Good luck to us.,btohqsg
Updates on Abundance1) After the recent warrants conversion completion this week   currently more than 50% of company own by the Chinese Jiang Hao & Shi Jiangang.2) Did you know that Abundance is one of those pennies which have crazy high turnover (approx $500million in FY2019)3)Former founders Charlie and Dora have been dumping their shares in open market and recent ceased to become SSH. The recent dumping should have been them . Based on calculations  they should have close minimal shares now.(30 000 lots approx was last disclosure but after the heavy selling  they might have even gotten rid fully)4) The main question is who absorbed the selling and now that most of the selling pressure from founders are gone  it will be easier for them to move up if they decide to play.,btohqsg
5) They have property assets that they been trying to dispose and if so  this would be strong catalyst for play up. Furthermore  with their links to the Chinese chemical business  there’s alot they can do.Currently  price ($0.027) is sitting at support line (refer to weekly chart. The box up retracement was very likely due to the sell down by Charlie and Dora)2021 should be an interesting year for Abundance. 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Good morning Hustlepeople !QOTD“To see what is right and not do it is a lack of courage.”– ConfuciusUS markets back to back green.This should bring up overall sentiments. Yesterday late afternoon pennies play up was likely to get ready for today run. Expecting some continuation and today might be a good day to recover some losses from last week sell down.Watch Marco Polo  Abundance  Blackgold. Price have supported well and should expect the bounce.Good luck and hope so 🙏🏻PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.,btohqsg

I think some Oceanus bb is trying to manipulate the charts. Suddenly sell down to 6.4 before quickly buying back to 6.6 so that it looks like a correction has already taken place. After that  price will rise to the next level.,btohqsg
Happen many times in oceanus journey from 4 cts to 6.6 cts,btohqsg

I read this earlier. How is it a “review” when it’s basically a write up on how tiger app works.I am still doubtful about this app. China places restriction on the trades for their citizens. Tiger helps them bypass this. Once ccp clam down on tiger who knows what will happen,btohqsg
added UG 77...believe still has room to go,btohqsg
Don't think anyone will be able to answer because we never know what's going to happen next.. worst scenario.. military decided to shoot everyone/anyone who goes in their way.. neutral scenario.. military tighten the control internally but leave the commercial  aspect untouched.. You guage yourself the situation and decide if it is an opportunity now..,btohqsg
