i have that poly student buff (they gave me the entire cloud for free),btohqsg
Real world examples showed me  idk if it has been skewed cause of my friend group or anything that is what I've constantly seen,btohqsg
ive been tryharding photoshop the past months,btohqsg
i feel like its the cliche generation hate type stuff,btohqsg
im guessing its just ur friendgrp,btohqsg
ur friend grp has caused u to have a very skewed perception of life and u involuntarily accepted that as a principle for living,btohqsg
i feel like the only time ppl treat their opportunities as chores is when they dont want to put in the effort to make the most out of it,btohqsg
which is why even though u consciously think you are not doing so  your own actions and words subconsciously say otherwise,btohqsg
bc if u rlly want the chance  itll only feel like a hassle if u feel its not worth it or ur lazy to actually put the work in,btohqsg
and my whole ass point is that the world is bigger than you and your friends  if you or your circle of friends treat opportunities as chores  then too bad you're missing out  because every opportunity that I come across is oversubscribed by my peers,btohqsg
and should i generalise that because my peers are so cutthroat  the whole world is cutthroat?,btohqsg
"i wish people stop applying for things I apply for then i stop getting comments like""Oh wow you are the first non-RI student that made it this far for this batch""",btohqsg
if you view the world through your friendgroup thats a massive skill issue,btohqsg
im not saying be extroverted but make people want to gravitate to you,btohqsg
Ive only seen two people from this gc irl before,btohqsg
yeah thats what i meant mb LOL,btohqsg
DEFINITELY a good strategy (hell no),btohqsg
one is someguy who left alr,btohqsg
KURO DOESNT KNOW HOW I LOOK LIKE,btohqsg
come letâ€™s make it a third,btohqsg
i don't even need to go back too far to find another instance of you generalising the entire bloody population,btohqsg
I did think  the sample size was above a dozen. But idk what is happening in their workplaces but many friends I know turn down invitations to functions or events because they are lazy  tired  don't feel like going etc.That is why I had that thinking,btohqsg
the world how many people ah,btohqsg
tbf i go NUS too so itâ€™s feasible later on,btohqsg
definitely alot more than a dozen,btohqsg
Yea cause that is what I've grown up seeing with my own eyes  you realise none of my statements have been generalized to any group,btohqsg
i need more irl friends thx,btohqsg
bro then the fuck si this,btohqsg
id travel to ntu just to use the field,btohqsg
that is EXACTLY what generalising is,btohqsg
youre taking data from a largely biased sample and extrapolating it to mean the entire population,btohqsg
"no i don't realise that  because ""people"" doesn't mean the things you've seen with your own eyesif u mean smth different from what others mean  then maybe it's a phrasing issue that you need to work on  and not how everyone else interprets what you say",btohqsg
I didnt go for my NTU interview,btohqsg
but thats cause my long term plan literally never involved me going to NTU,btohqsg
Seems very much like a phrasing issue  and how I phrase certain statements comes across as ok while others seem confrontational,btohqsg
Sample size less than 30 h2 math says that sample is unreliable,btohqsg
h2 math is the holy grail of math,btohqsg
anything that is not h2 math is not math,btohqsg
facts (i wanna take h2 math),btohqsg
i tried learning jc math but i cant understand the fucking binomial bs,btohqsg
the issue isn't that you'reconfrontational  the issue is that the way you phrase things make you sound like you're generatlising the entire population based on waht you've seen in the ~20 short years  even though you've been living in a country that's thrice your age and a modern world many times your age,btohqsg
what is a n choose r ðŸ˜¡,btohqsg
she C on my N till i R,btohqsg
she N on my P till i R,btohqsg
I mean like this statement  I just needed to clarify and that was settled,btohqsg
einstein didnt fuck his cousin for this,btohqsg
how do u become a teacher without liking kids,btohqsg
And this statement actually led to a good discussion I felt,btohqsg
"every time i pass by the tp daycare i look at the children and go ""LITTLE CHINESE BOY""",btohqsg
I think ryan what happens is that u ask a very general statement then u make it seem like its something true. But when it goes on into further discussions  especially for things you're not super familiar with  it becomes even more confusing what youre trying to get at,btohqsg
