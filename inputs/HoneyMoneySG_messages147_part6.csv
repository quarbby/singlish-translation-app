I‚Äôm not sure as I‚Äôm only claiming for one parent. Maybe you can call into IRAS to check.It‚Äôs not difficult to apply for it. IRAS website has the steps on how to apply.https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-reliefs-rebates-and-deductions/tax-reliefs/parent-relief-parent-relief-(disability),btohqsg
If u have your slibing claiming. Only one person will get. So u have to ask them.,btohqsg
I believe you can share amongst sibling/sil/dil.How it is shared is a family discussion. Not for IRAS to decide,btohqsg
Anybody claim parent relief successfully when parents are not staying in SG for whole year?,btohqsg
If you go read the terms in IRAS website for parent relief  ‚Äúwas 55 years of age or above is living in your household in Singapore‚Äù If it is first time claim  I sure they can easily check based on records,btohqsg
Yes. I mean I will pay the relief portion of the tax saved for slibing if he used half. I get the full amount relief. That what I do. Can shared too also.,btohqsg
"Living in Singapore"" means that the dependant was staying in Singapore permanently  except for temporary absences (e.g. short overseas vacation) in 2023. In the case of a foreign dependant  generally  if he/she stayed in Singapore for a period of at least 8 months in 2023.Same will be applicable for YA 2025. Just change the year to 2024",btohqsg
Can share directly when filing tax as the tax bracket of each person is different. Unless of course all claimants are in the same tax bracket‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Parent Relief/Parent Relief (Disability) may be shared with other claimants provided no one else is claiming any other relief (exceptGrandparent Caregiver Relief)on the same dependant. For example  if your father has claimedspouse reliefonyour mother  you and your other siblings will not be able to claim parent relief in respect of your mother.,btohqsg
