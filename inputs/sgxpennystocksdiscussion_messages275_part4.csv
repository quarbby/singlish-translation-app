Wah u like exotic places? üòÇ,btohqsg
Wow u appear means market recovery coming,btohqsg
Ya haha. Before coronavirus  my last trip was to Uzbekistan üòÇ,btohqsg
Their version of briyani (pilav) jin ho jiak man,btohqsg
Cos you know tourist mah  then they treat you v v well,btohqsg
My whole Uzbek trip I spent S$1.2k for 8* days. And $800 was for the flight sia,btohqsg
The flight usually $400+ one. But I delay and delay then in the end suck thumb pay high price,btohqsg
I highly recommend  but now they got no direct flight from Changi alr. Must fly thru KL or JKT,btohqsg
Oo interesting.. I wanna go Kazakhstan one day  their building design looks very interesting,btohqsg
Ya I had wanted to go too  but no time cos I was still in NS. Cannot take much leave. But Kazakhstan fly there damn blardy ex,btohqsg
And domestic transport also not cheap. Almaty to Astana the high speed train almost half a day  and costs hundreds,btohqsg
I took the HSR in Uzbekistan from Tashkent to Bukhara  not even US$30 I think. From Khiva to Tashkent back by flight  also ard US$40,btohqsg
Wah need save up liao haha üòÜ,btohqsg
Usually to Kazakhstan ppl fly thru South Korea I think,btohqsg
Last time the viable way was to fly to Tashkent from SG direct  then take a car into Almaty cos Tashkent near the border,btohqsg

Now they can call it pump and dump or whatever but fact of the matter is that bb use their power to stop people from buying the share.. only can sell how to maintain let alone increase price.. this one is good example that stock market is controlled by big $$.. follow the big $$ dont go against it,btohqsg
Sadly some lives might be lost after this,btohqsg
