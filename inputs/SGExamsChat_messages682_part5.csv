when you learn these skills in sch it's only in the context of that subject. This isn't specific to our system,btohqsg

what time is it...im about to go to bed lol,btohqsg
meanwhile i need to train my soft skills,btohqsg
coz my interview success rate is horrible,btohqsg
yes but i also guarantee your understanding of the material back then isn't as good as you'd think it was,btohqsg
just make sure to prep properly,btohqsg
average emotional intelligence of singaporean students is pretty low id say  they simply spend too much time on studying + the combination of social media leads them to not be able to think for themselves and form their own self-realisation  leading to emotional immaturity,btohqsg
I had a yi friend who graduated in 2022 and he thinks that he had a pw group mate with autism. I wonder if it’s the same person. But it’s quite likely that the autism went undiagnosed. Even if it might be quite obvious their child has autism  some parents are in denial and refuse to believe their child has any mental disorders  and as a result they don’t want to seek professional help. Which imo is very selfish for both the child and the ppl around them  especially when it comes to PW. If the person with autism is unable to contribute or ruins the flow of the presentation  it’s definitely not the group’s fault.,btohqsg
how do u make ur name empty,btohqsg
so i can keep commenting hate,btohqsg
Just try leaving it blank or search for the empty character,btohqsg
Anyway I didn’t hide my username so,btohqsg
wait is this the knorr brand tomato pasta cup?,btohqsg
i got free coffee from my hotel this morning,btohqsg

either gorilla mode pre or 3x coffee a day,btohqsg
sometimes i gorilla mode then afternoon when i got shit i take 2 more cups,btohqsg
gorilla mode gave me chest pain for awhile,btohqsg
Is it joshua ng? I went back to check  it was indeed class of 2022 lmao,btohqsg
Idk have to ask my friend. But he said that during the oral presentation that group mate kept giggling,btohqsg
My PW group also got burden but,btohqsg
At least the group component for OP isn’t screwed up,btohqsg
Im just vv scared coz i suck at interviews coz i cant elab n talk:-(,btohqsg
Also in the whole group all Bs and Cs,btohqsg
Prolly cost ppl their As n Bs,btohqsg
Meanwhile my gp tutor gave us a B ticket,btohqsg
Quite likely I guess  but besides that autistic guy got at least one other slacker,btohqsg
Oh yea i heard fr my friend that yi only 17% A,btohqsg
But i wished at least moe should hv records and dun be too harsh,btohqsg
Idk if they rly released the exact stats or that is some leak  but not going to be surprised if it’s true,btohqsg
I think he wasn’t even diagnosed,btohqsg
Oh then maybe a different guy,btohqsg
Coz the guy i read about went fr pathlight to yi,btohqsg
Oh so this guy got a proper diagnosis ah,btohqsg
Ok then probably got multiple ppl with autism in Yi class of 2022 then,btohqsg
Just that only at least one was properly diagnosed,btohqsg
My brother didnt even go mainstream,btohqsg
Tbh i think these ppl are already high functioning that they can study like acad wise,btohqsg
In my sec sch got another guy from pathlight but I think his autism was more high functioning,btohqsg
TM got one j1 this yr apparently,btohqsg
Uk my friend told me her friend was so nice to do the script for all her group mates,btohqsg
Nope he is 100% SPED sch (just graduated coz they stop at 18) then now at sheltered workshop,btohqsg
As in her friend was in the same group with the guy with autism?,btohqsg
Oh wow but the fact he can enter TM means he is high functioning,btohqsg
No like coz yi groups has a lot of slackers etc,btohqsg
Actually even something as small as Asperger’s level is alr considered autism so I guess it shouldn’t be too uncommon,btohqsg
Wth lol so her friend was doing work for somebody that wasn’t even in her group,btohqsg
Then this friend helped her groupmates write the scripts,btohqsg
