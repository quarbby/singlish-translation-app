92  95 or 98 depending on your engine compression. V power has better internal cleaning properties...at least what they claim if you can't benefit on other factors.,btohqsg
What engine compression? Only air fuel ratio and ignition/injection timing,btohqsg
And internal cleaning lol... First time I hear petrol can clean engine,btohqsg
Have to go rehab to stop using?,btohqsg
Your compression ratio doesn't change. So whatever the car manufacturer recommends the minimum fuel octane number just use that,btohqsg
Any higher you'd just be wasting money,btohqsg
But actually there are different school of thought,btohqsg
Some believe this some believe that🤭🤭,btohqsg
see which brand of koyok u prefer lor,btohqsg
That's what I said. Want to use what Ron it depends on the engine compression ratio. And I agree manufacturers will indicate what Ron to use... based on the compression ratio,btohqsg
Use cataclean. One time all clean up.,btohqsg
That's chemical clean  can do walnut/dry ice blasting also same outcome,btohqsg
Only need to do if always idle  or after 50k or so,btohqsg
