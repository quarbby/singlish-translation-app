Sit in police car drive around. Look for coffeeshop to dabao food,btohqsg

we don't need people here preaching that some particular part of something is better than everything else,btohqsg
Then after dabao food  go to police post to eat. Then lie down in rest area for a while to relax,btohqsg
Then drive around again. Look for another coffeeshop to buy teh and snacks. Then go back NPC to relax a bit and settle paperwork.,btohqsg
Then by then can knock off liao,btohqsg
No preaching bro. I just sharing knowledge. But soon when you enlist you will gain your own knowledge which you may or may not share.,btohqsg

Cos probably no need 90rp for it,btohqsg
I think 90rp is useless if someone sucks at interviews anyways,btohqsg
but of course there are many ppl  who are good at interviews and also have 90rp,btohqsg
Thats if u can even get to the interview HAHA,btohqsg
But they filter 90rp even if u r toastmaster international,btohqsg
yeah but having a pessimistic attitude and spreading negative vibes is no good too >:((,btohqsg

Who ask u never get 90rp,btohqsg
Does 90 equate to straight As (4H2  gp),btohqsg
But its a damn useless certificate lol,btohqsg
It judges the most useless metric which is test taking/academic ability,btohqsg
eh i think the harsh truth is correct,btohqsg
no 90rp no talk is generally true,btohqsg

No 90rp no talk at uni level HAHA,btohqsg
