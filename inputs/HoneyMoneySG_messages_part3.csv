Yes for some  like DBS Live fresh,btohqsg
Not all works  usually ownself try then will know,btohqsg
after reading through its T&C  I think GrabPay top-up is qualified for the minimum spending  but definitely not for the cashbackðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
so Chris you are right in your previous videos  that the best idea is to have an un-limited cashback card for GrabPayðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Amex tcb and uob absolute qualifies for grabpay cash back. (have only tried Amex though and it works) ~,btohqsg
Yes  its quite important for live fresh though  when you are unable to hit $600 spending. Then just top up Grabpay to hit it,btohqsg
Yes these two are eligible  as mentioned in my earlier cashback card videos,btohqsg
I applied for Citi Cashback +  just because it's a master card instead of AMEXðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Anyone intending to apply for DBS card as new customer  please wait awhile for my Monday (Aug 9) video  will have a $300 signup promo,btohqsg
true  I just feel like an idiot now... as I applied for DBS last weekendðŸ˜•,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/AKBA2L9TetAIn this video  I will reveal and update my Endowus Robo Advisor Portfolio performance after 8 monthsMy purpose is to show you what I invest in  and put my money where my mouth is  so that it can help you can decide for yourself whether you want to invest in Endowus as well.,btohqsg
Just watched the video ðŸ˜‡. I dont have cpf / srs to invest . Just invested cash in endowus last week .Need some advice !! Pls@ChrisHMSGI was investing in Syfe since dec 2020  Reits & equity100  .Is it a wiser choice to stick to one robo & park most of the money into one portfolio    Or    Can Do both sides Endowus (Cash) +  Syfe REITS .,btohqsg
It is okay to have multiple robo advisors as long as you can keep track of them. I am also using both Endowus and Syfe now,btohqsg
Is there anyway I can TCB Amex to top up dash?,btohqsg
Tcb - grab - revolut - dash,btohqsg
Though I wouldn't do it for the effort,btohqsg
Will grab to revolut move the power up challenge tracker? If it does  then it might be a little worth it,btohqsg
How will preferential offering works on a custodian broker? Will we still be able to subscribe for excess?,btohqsg
Yes  still can. I talked about it in my brokerage videohttps://youtu.be/PGPaJVAewhc,btohqsg

Hi Chris  do you know whether Citi SMRT works with favepay for the 5% cashback?,btohqsg
I thought it would  but I didnt get it for favepay,btohqsg
Weird considering Citi Rewards work for favepay,btohqsg
Yeah i had the same assumption.End up didn't qualify for the monthly $500 min spend for cashback,btohqsg
Someone else tested before? Haha because if never hit 500 min spend wouldn't know.Thought could use it for big furniture purchases since Gain City takes favepay payments,btohqsg
I was trying to buy some BYJ (a REITs ETF) with Tiger Broker  but my orders were immediately cancelled saying 'the product is currently unavailable'. Anybody knows why?,btohqsg
I guess it's still open to trade  but its transaction history looks a bit weird to me,btohqsg
Hi Guys  just wondering if there's any Credit Card expert here ðŸ¤£ So  the thing is  I am about to make  a ring purchase for my proposal and I am not sure what Credit Card can give me the best cashback? I don't spend a lot every month  at least not for now until I have to start paying for renovation  wedding dinner etc. But what will be a good all rounder card such that you can even pay your insurance  electricity bills  town council payment etc? BTW  the ring cost $7 000  but I am paying by installments.I have the Citi 1.6% and Standard Chartered 1.5%  but I find that I want to up my game a little bit and also considering a higher cashback value?,btohqsg
When I mean I don't spend a lot  it's usually below $500.,btohqsg
Not sure why as I don't use Tiger for reit etf. Try buying CFA?,btohqsg
I think there're 3 REITs ETFs in SG  I can buy the other two without any hassle,btohqsg
but I want to buy all of them  for some sort of diversification ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
If you don't want all the min spend tnc nonsense  just go for UOB Absolute with Grabpay Mastercard,btohqsg
There will be interlaps in the portfolio constituents so the diversification doesnt really work here. Diversification happens when the underlying business is different e.g. retail vs commercial vs industrial reit,btohqsg
true  but I think these three REITs ETFs have different region focus,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ but you are right  they are all REITs and overlap with each other to some extent,btohqsg
Oh yes  saw that  but they don't have contactless payment haha!,btohqsg
Well you can use the grabpay MC contactlessly with the physical card or with Samsung pay,btohqsg
Just to add on   UOB Absolute AMex has 5% for first $3000 spend as a new customer  till 30 Sep 2021.So just top up $3000 to Grabpay and get $150 cashback,btohqsg
Anyone here applying for Aug 2021 Bto? It's out!,btohqsg
So effectively  top up grabpay if Plat user  its 5 + 1.2 = 6.2% cashback?,btohqsg
Correct  not bad for $3000 spending if you are new to bank,btohqsg
That's also true for Citi CashBack+  new users can get 4.5% for the first 5k spending,btohqsg
so that's $225  more than $150ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
If you're a grab plat user and top up w UOB Absolute1st 3k spend = 5% + 1.2% (grab plat) = $1862nd 2k spend = 1.7% + 1.2% (grab plat) = $58Total cashback valuation of 5k spend = $244,btohqsg
true  but you can also top up Grab with this Citibank Cashback+,btohqsg
so in total  that's 5000 * (4.5% + 1.2%) = $285,btohqsg
Citi cashback plus allows wallet top ups?,btohqsg
Don't think so. So far only know AMEX true cashback and UOB Absolute,btohqsg
Yep thats what I know as well,btohqsg
