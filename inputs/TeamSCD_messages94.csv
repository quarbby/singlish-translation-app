Dont know malaysia brought in by where,btohqsg
But i had my bad experience,btohqsg
i still waiting for my refund,btohqsg
He like on the run now,btohqsg
shit  i still thought the rims he offered were quite attractive,btohqsg
is his suppliers issue or his issue sia,btohqsg
Bodykit can rep  rims  tyres brakes suspension never ever ever rep,btohqsg
and i stupidly go pay him,btohqsg
so it's refurbished to look like new la,btohqsg
But pain white but different white,btohqsg
den u ask for refund ah,btohqsg
He should let us know not wait,btohqsg
Cause that point i need new set of tyres also,btohqsg
i nv even see my rims yet,btohqsg
if notstock rims see until i wan die,btohqsg
But i chased him every single day,btohqsg
paint brake calipers pls ty hahahah,btohqsg
Next month haha today no timee,btohqsg
From wad I heard....swg dude was involved in a quite serious car accident back then,btohqsg
Not sure if it is accurate anot,btohqsg
That wad I heard from somewhere,btohqsg
But in the end  delay refund until 10 months?,btohqsg
"""CERTIFICATION - Stamford Sport Wheels ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏≠‡πÅ‡∏°‡πá‡∏Å‡∏ã‡πå""https://www.stamfordwheels.com/certification/",btohqsg
That's why buy reps also must see standards,btohqsg
If the reps all ISO TUV VIA JWL certified,btohqsg
if really have difficulty  should still be available to offer explanation instead of ghost?,btohqsg
So just save up ur money get ori rims best,btohqsg
stamford quote me almost 3k full set,btohqsg
integrity lies in the certification body. just saying haha,btohqsg
"The 15"" looks dope man in black",btohqsg
Stock rims are safer than rep rims anytime,btohqsg
True until u get sick of it,btohqsg
One time the rep rim fail you  that one is real sick,btohqsg
The damage repair will easily exceed the ori rims price,btohqsg
Thats why if can avoid rep,btohqsg
But i understand some want make car nicr,btohqsg
If anything happened or malfunction.....the repairs going be deep man,btohqsg
wow this one. even those higher end cars using,btohqsg
End up is you no luck,btohqsg
2 car both buy no luck,btohqsg
today looked for tyres for friend,btohqsg
So gf suay then you lucky,btohqsg
Seen quite alot in 2019 made tyres,btohqsg
Damn suay i tell u this month,btohqsg
1 year from current year still consider ‚Äúnew‚Äù,btohqsg
This one you too much activity,btohqsg
Change bed maybe change your luck,btohqsg
Take some Feng shui tips maybe will improve,btohqsg
2021 but dunno which week heh,btohqsg
Hopefully this bed frame give me good rest,btohqsg
first 2 numbers is the week of the year.,btohqsg
eg. 2021 means week 20 of 2021,btohqsg
As in the ws only say made in yr 2021,btohqsg
But TUV and ISO certification is not easy to get. They will audit your entire process also. Not just the wheel quality itself.,btohqsg
Like some food manufacturing company they also got ISO certification. They also dont test the food itself,btohqsg
agreed. not sure for TUV but ISO depends which regulation is being certified. it could be safety  environmental  manufacturing processes etc.,btohqsg
so it's good to see which standard they are certified with,btohqsg
So they have ISO doesnt mean the entire company have ISO?,btohqsg
like for my company we mainly focus on ISO9001 (documentation) and ISO45001 (safety compliance).,btohqsg
means on which aspect is being certified,btohqsg
there are many standards of ISO to cover the many aspects of a company.,btohqsg
you can go dig into it. there's a lot haha. i only sharing what i know because have to deal w the auditors,btohqsg
So for SSW it looks like it is design and manufacturing,btohqsg
ya so for 9001 they check for how quality is ensured and controlled,btohqsg
even for machinery whether they have regular inspection or servicing records etc.,btohqsg
Thats just saving a penny to lose a pound later,btohqsg
Like using cheap engine oil and then see white smoke from your performance car,btohqsg
So does it still mean the quality of the wheel will be good?,btohqsg
tbh i dont think so. HAHA,btohqsg
Not really although it gives u some degree of confidence in the company,btohqsg
Ultimately whether a brand makes sure their wheels hold up  its their reputation on the line,btohqsg
Rep makers have no such worry,btohqsg
They only need the outside to look the same,btohqsg
They can use cast iron and u wont know,btohqsg
It think really goes from brand to brand ba,btohqsg
If you're a branded rep maker trying to make it big in the future  reputation definitely on the line.,btohqsg
Compared to those brandless rep maker,btohqsg
like  even if they send to independent testing facility  it may only just be that one good set that they send.,btohqsg
Compared to AL tyres reps u dont even know the rims come from where,btohqsg
Ssw is a rep maker? Arent they an independent brand?,btohqsg
unless they have to regularly report their qc to someone else. maybe a manufacturer or something.,btohqsg
My TE37 is made by them,btohqsg
i did enquire before  like 900+ per set iirc,btohqsg
i can see it on my car too,btohqsg
Even Rota is an independant brand ma,btohqsg
Those arent really replicas but more like ssw copy their design?,btohqsg
Do they market it as te37?,btohqsg
they have their own model name,btohqsg
Then its not strictly a replica,btohqsg
But you can tell ma  it's a TE37 rep,btohqsg
So your replica is really those unknown brand la,btohqsg
Yea but put it this way  its like samsung makes a phone and outward appearance is iphone,btohqsg
Meaning its sold as te37 and marketed as such and has no brand behind it,btohqsg
Because obviously it would be illegal,btohqsg
Ok i get what you mean,btohqsg
So you feel that branded copies marketted as similar design is ok,btohqsg
Yea i never thought about lookalikes this way,btohqsg
but those brandless market as TE37 is not,btohqsg
Since they dont tia the sticker or market it as such,btohqsg
or rather they used to la,btohqsg
they put their own SSW branding,btohqsg
I assume they would have to otherwise rays will come after them,btohqsg
Actuall wheel design wise i wonder how the copyright laws go,btohqsg
Hahaha rota they said is they change like dk 15 or 20%,btohqsg
I think there are some slight changes or differences between the rays version n ssw,btohqsg
Stamford is a veryarge scale company..I doubt they do anything so obvious,btohqsg
Hearsay some thai reps come from their factory also,btohqsg
But Stamford is very old established tire company locally,btohqsg
One of the biggest players in the market,btohqsg
But Stamford wanted to go own route make own wheels,btohqsg
YHI smart  they buy into shares,btohqsg
My oz rims wheel caps are peeling off alrü§≠ need go change,btohqsg
honda jade actually looks not bad,btohqsg
That part is peeling off alr so i change,btohqsg
Still with me since 2005 üòç,btohqsg
SG has very little love for BBS i realize,btohqsg
i dont really like BBS rims.. too many spoke,btohqsg
i dont like due to the mesh design tho,btohqsg
like 5 or 6 straight spokes,btohqsg
last time i tot the ssr type c too skinny nt nice,btohqsg
but see in rl not bad leh haha,btohqsg
i like type C more than TE37 cos skinny,btohqsg
it's the same engine as the civic 1.5t,btohqsg
the turbo is dk bigger or something about the fans being better,btohqsg
Wah cant wait for the meet. Only 4 more days :),btohqsg
The rims on my Fit looks like heavy duty lorry one when i took over. LOL,btohqsg
No la bro dont overthink it üòÇ,btohqsg
Eh steelies is a proper trend,btohqsg
Take out the cheapskate  desgin. U can see your orignal rim,btohqsg
Yes i'd rather remove the wheel cover and leave exposed steelies,btohqsg
"lol. I ""removed"" the entire wheels.",btohqsg
Without the offset it looks like van wheels,btohqsg
you put spacer on steelies LTA cannot catch,btohqsg
If i have cash and nothing to do maybe i try 1 day,btohqsg
Buy steelies  paint it white and run it for awhile,btohqsg
Paint it gloss black also not bad. Unique,btohqsg
White and black  pfft. Come on guys,btohqsg
Red yellow two tone  when running u get orange,btohqsg
Or black and white. Like pizza.,btohqsg
Or better yet for civics  blue yellow. When running u have green,btohqsg

Why. Why is this car shape popular i dont understand,btohqsg
like you need space  can always buy a wagon,btohqsg

SG also no dirt road for you to cross or go camping,btohqsg
SUV makes you can't see me,btohqsg
