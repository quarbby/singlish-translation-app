"He could not be anymore excited he thought to himself ""I'm one year older  one less year less from being able to drive a car"".

"Today was John's birthday  and he couldn't wait to get home from school. He had been looking forward to this day for what felt like forever. As he rushed out of the school gates  he felt a surge of excitement and happiness. He had plans to celebrate with his mother  and he couldn't wait to see the smile on her face when he walked in the door.In his haste  John didn't notice the red light at the crosswalk. He stepped out into the street  and before he could even react  a truck came speeding around the corner and knocked him to the ground.John's world went dark  and everything went silent. He felt a sharp pain in his head  and then... nothing.The truck driver slammed on the brakes  but it was too late. John's body lay motionless on the pavement. The driver jumped out of the truck  horrified by what had just happened.John's mother was waiting at home  eagerly preparing his favorite cake and dinner. But as the minutes ticked by  she began to worry. Where was John? He should have been home by now.The doorbell rang  and she opened the door to find a somber-faced police officer standing on her porch. ""Ma'am  I have some terrible news..."" he began  his voice trembling.John's mother's world came crashing down around her as she heard the words she would never forget: ""Your son was in an accident. I'm so sorry  ma'am. He didn't make it.""The celebration that was meant to be a joyous occasion turned into a tragedy. John's life was cut short in an instant  all because of a moment of recklessness. His mother was left with only memories of her dear son  and a pain that would never go away.In the days and weeks that followed  John's mother struggled to cope with the loss of her child. She became withdrawn and isolated  unable to face the world without her son by her side. She would often find herself standing at the crosswalk where John was killed  reliving the moment over and over again in her mind.As time went on  she began to experience flashbacks and nightmares  reliving the trauma of that fateful day. She would wake up in the middle of the night  drenched in sweat  with the sound of screeching tires and shattering glass echoing in her mind.The diagnosis was clear: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). John's mother was trapped in a never-ending cycle of grief and trauma  unable to escape the pain of her loss.She sought therapy and support  but the pain never fully went away. She learned to live with it  but the scars of that day would always remain. The memory of John's bright smile and eager excitement on his last birthday would haunt her forever  a bittersweet reminder of the fragility of life and the devastating consequences of a single moment of recklessness.",btohqsg
