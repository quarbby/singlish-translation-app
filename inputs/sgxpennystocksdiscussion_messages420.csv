Got someone blocking and accumulating today. Observe YZJ long enough to spot the same trick,btohqsg
Surprising to u maybe. Everton has nothing to play for. Sheffield confirmed relegated. So every sheffield player would want to perform so EPL teams next year would want to hire them,btohqsg

why not.....those who have big balls win big,btohqsg
I think the buying pressure is way too strong for meds now. BBs likely to feel cornered to push up  ya? ü§î,btohqsg
That 26k really can clear all my student loan,btohqsg
How come ppl can post green ah,btohqsg
There's a $0.50 gap currently btw MT SGX and Taiwan and it has been 10% limit for for the past 5 days. i think it can last another 2-3 days before a major profit taking took place.,btohqsg
Penny chat keep post red losses,btohqsg

Hi guys  I am just looking at Sembcorp Marine Ltd at 0.18. What do you think of this stock?,btohqsg
Personally will stay away for the near term because losses will continue the entire FY. Will consider year end,btohqsg
What's wrong with his brain...Just because of Gu Gu bird  cannot be doctor forever...üò≥üò≥üò≥,btohqsg
Should I buy and hold since 10 lot will cost $180 which is still pretty affordable? Thoughts?,btohqsg
What other penny stocks would you recommend?,btohqsg
As the hype goes for now is Jiutian Chemical.,btohqsg
Believe it will drop further. Save up that $180,btohqsg
Nowadays ppl use 1 lot = 100 shares liao,btohqsg
probably not the right term... 1 lot should be 1000 shares lei...,btohqsg
Nowadays 1 lot is 100 liao,btohqsg
Ya last time was 1k..thats why everytime ppl say X lots  must ask if 100 or 1k...,btohqsg
I think many newer investors don't rmb the days of 1k = 1 lot üòÇ,btohqsg
But harder to buy shares in blue chips also..,btohqsg
Noob questionDid gaza  war in Middle East affect oil price and gold price.?,btohqsg

If bb want to push the price u cannot get it .If they want to pull down the price U get it . But cannot win money . Sometimes lower price does not mean good. Anyway last Friday bb already collected at 7.,btohqsg
Why cannot win leh? Cos trend down to 4?,btohqsg
If break to 6 trend down to 4?,btohqsg
He just saying .. all is BB will,btohqsg
Maybe there are people fighting a proxy war there,btohqsg
This stock now is very popular already. Most likely it will continue uptrend movement. Many people waiting to buy low. Bb want to buy low not other people.,btohqsg
Then I hope my order don't get filed for everyone's sake üòÇ,btohqsg
just take money go home sua,btohqsg
Not 100%. This is my point of view üòÅ,btohqsg

Heng I stay on the other side of the island,btohqsg

"U talk big for a young guy who prob never see the hash era of SG. Don't see u go out n help ""defend"" SG. Instead I only see u kbkb here n scream for MT price to go up.  U want houses to stay when u graduate? Then go construction site build your house. If u can't do that  then don't complain govt bringing in workers to help build your country.88 year old man got the strength to go be cleaner during this pandemic. U can do what he did?",btohqsg
The question is not whether Inori can do it or not,btohqsg
Why are we treating our elders like that,btohqsg
Immune system deteriorates with age.. sending an 88 year old man to a location where there's a high potential for virus transmission is not the best choice of action,btohqsg
At the end of the day   we are all in this shet together,btohqsg
