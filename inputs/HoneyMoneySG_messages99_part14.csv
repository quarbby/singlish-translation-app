Thank you! Thought it will only be applied to the spendings starting from May. üòä,btohqsg
Provided they can meet the salary credit requirement. Also many of them also probably have oub and OCBC accounts,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI‚Äôm not sure if the SRS topup topic after the changed in SA policy changed this year was covered. Can the amount be withdrawn at 55 if FRS are met? Or it remains the same.,btohqsg
I think you mean whether the SA top-up monies can be withdrawn after 55? No change to that  any amount above FRS can be withdrawn,btohqsg

Hi all... jus wanna check... if i were to charge my friend 2cents/miles  do i lose out???,btohqsg
I helping my friend to redeem for a flight ticket. So just trying out to see if its worth for me,btohqsg
Guys. sorry what is this about? Rising Dragon?,btohqsg
Your earned cash back will be stuck if u don‚Äôt use it the next month,btohqsg
It‚Äôs Plunging Chicken and it‚Äôs rather bad promo now,btohqsg
Hi all sharing ghe new big saving promotion for uob one. I am now in the current rising dragon promotion. As I already got earmarked 100k for march until june does this means I have to topup 50k is the best so I can enjoy interest still to max 150khttps://www.uob.com.sg/personal/promotions/save/index.page?s_cid=grm:sg:owned:onl:pweb:productpg:bu:na:casa:010124-300324-:Q1SAVE24:na:na&vid=na&pid=CD07Q1SAVE24,btohqsg
is this more worth it than converting to miles? how should we value this at?,btohqsg
Some balances cannot be converted to KF miles and will be stuck as KrisPay miles,btohqsg
For uob salaryplus promotion if anyone can share what's direct credit service on cdp dividend? If I just buy t bill and get interest does it count? Thanks,btohqsg
When signing up cc to get bonus miles from paying annual fee  when does the annual fee get charged? On 1st statement?,btohqsg
thank u ! if can convert to KF miles is more worth than the 20% miles back right?,btohqsg
Depends on the camp you‚Äôre on  but since I value miles @ 1.25c each  I rather keep them as KF miles and for events like these.. I use it to burn off krispay only miles that I cannot convert into KF üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Oic! I value them at arnd 1c ea only  do u think I value them too low? haha,btohqsg
KrisPay miles are usable in KrisPay at a rate of 150 miles = S$1 soooo(Sauce)But yeah overall of course must see if you collect miles to begin with la (a pure Cashback fella most likely wouldn‚Äôt have much miles collected before it expires in KrisFlyer),btohqsg
For UOB frequent flyer conversion program (ad-how)  I just need to register once and I can proceed to redeem miles right? I don‚Äôt have to fill up the form every time I want to redeem  is that right?,btohqsg
Yes once can Liao. Then manual transfer using Uob app,btohqsg
This is from OCBC.. let's just put salary and save .. (with 100k) ..Is it accurate that a 6.4% will be given?,btohqsg
Of cos will spend more than 500.. so does  it make it 7% ?,btohqsg
What categories u plan to do for the 7%?,btohqsg
You don‚Äôt add like that. Look at the EIR Effective interest rate. Salary and save is 4% for 100k.,btohqsg
Where did u see the 6.4%?,btohqsg
Just purely savings salary crediting and spending,btohqsg
The website lo. I screen shot that couple minutes ago,btohqsg
If 7%  the whole Singapore will dump their money into OCBC,btohqsg
Will it did when UOB had that offer lol,btohqsg
I see here see there. Don‚Äôt know how u get 7%,btohqsg
7% Only reminds me of the GST we used to have,btohqsg
As@leechee2advise.. I was wrong. My apologies.,btohqsg
Shall we enter moomoo after this month with UOB?,btohqsg
6.4% is only applicable on your $25k out of $100k.,btohqsg
If you really want 5% or more  you can‚Äôt really get from HISA  you have to get bank or reit stocks.,btohqsg
Oh I see! Thanks thanks. Im just seeking the best interest and it's not easy to get a good deal...,btohqsg
If you can do Spend + Save + Salary  you can consider OCBC. Only hassle is you need monitor your MAB. So you may want to have another account for holding and deploying purpose without disturbing OCBC MAB.,btohqsg
It is easy to read uob mab but not sure about ocbc,btohqsg
But now ocbc 360 and hsbc ega is highest interest now...,btohqsg
You spend extra time just to get that extra percentage of money. You know how much time is worth and decide yourself. HISA to me is just to have a monthly source of passive income and don‚Äôt have to earn the highest. My time is better spend deciding what to invest in. MMF  stocks  Tbills etc. these can earn more.,btohqsg
Summary of some high interest bank account changes from may 2024:1. Uob one change from 5% to 4%2. Standard chartered change from 4.68% to 3.68%3. Hsbc ega no more 1% credit card spend rebate,btohqsg
my man mouse hunter spent that extra time to figure out so those who wanna earn that interest gain don‚Äôt have to  mad respect üôèüôè,btohqsg
Now is whether OCBC will revise. If they do  it will likely in May,btohqsg
i opted for ocbc 360 at first becuz it‚Äôs the most hassle free as compared to uob etc  now it‚Äôs one of the highest interest ones lol  the nerf is coming for sure,btohqsg
