Would prefer cashback  heard that miles valuation will always change 🤔,btohqsg
Usually large spending is more worth it in miles but if you want cashback  you can look at:UOB ONEhttps://bit.ly/HM-UOB-ONEHSBC Advance Visahttps://bit.ly/sgadvance,btohqsg

Wanted to know too  asked this question before but no answer yet,btohqsg
You max out 30K on your grab already?,btohqsg

For example  Stock X is 1000 USD per share  and I buy 100.1 USD of it  which is 0.1001 share  but actually what I will get is 0.100 share due to rounding on Syfe Trade. Am I correct? If so  then Syfe Trade is not really fee-free  🙁,btohqsg
Based on the fact that the minimum unit on Syfe Trade is 0.001 share  if you buy a stock that's N dollars per share  then at most you will lose N/1000 dollars just because of rounding,btohqsg
They don't round down.. just a most interfaces it's rounded,btohqsg
where do you get this qty?,btohqsg
I checked Syfe APP and the PDF statement they sent me  only 3 digits,btohqsg
you're right  seems that they only hide extra digits in the main interface 🤣,btohqsg
"if you sell  click sell all and not type the ""rounded"" full amount. You can click the question mark to confirm the amount",btohqsg
one more question  now I can see how many shares I own  but how can I check the precise shares I bought in a single order,btohqsg
in view order details page  it's rounded to 0.001 only,btohqsg
I believe you can do math yourself. Order value / price. Make sure it's both same currency.,btohqsg
May I know what syfe app best use for? Us stock sg stock or,btohqsg
You can only buy US stocks on Syfe,btohqsg
best for commission-free US stock trading,btohqsg
So using jade green cro card for lounge access need to pay fee of $3.25usd?,btohqsg
Anyone received the transport cashback in Revolut? 😟,btohqsg
I did not. This is weird,btohqsg
[Update to Term 7.1: Revolut will contact all participants who have been awarded any cashback by email and deposit the cashback amounts into their Revolut Account within thirty (30) business days after the end of each Campaign Period.],btohqsg
So instead of receiving cash back every month  we will only get after the 3rd month?,btohqsg
Maybe Chris host a meetup session since your last video mention about networking.,btohqsg
Dear all  i have some transitional cash used for cash flow purposes  which I would require in a quarterly cycle. Any good options to park the cash other than sitting in the bank account? The criteria would be that it must be safe and immediately withdraw-able. Welcome all constructive suggestions please. Thanks!,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGwould you be producing bto series for this may launch. Been hoping for it. Would love to see your analysis!,btohqsg
💨 Dash PET 1.3% interest:https://bit.ly/sgdashCODE DASH-RXQ45,btohqsg
For Dash PET it seems that for first 10k for 1st year  the best rate is 1.5% after selecting inclusion for some insurance  which has no penalty/downside upon account closure (just 0.70sgd for each paynow withdrawal)  although rates are not guaranteed (worst case is just take bac principle minus 70cents transaction fee right?)--For the first policy year  1.30% p.a. up to S$10 000 and 0.30% p.a. for subsequent amount in Account Value. Crediting rates are non-guaranteed. Additional 0.2% p.a. to the existing 1.3% p.a. returns for your first S$10 000 Dash PET savings during the first policy year while the complimentary protection is active.,btohqsg
