🎉Pika World Fed Review – 23 August 2022🎉⛳Stocks hammered by interest rate fear💰After a few months of lower volatility  the equity market dropped sharply on Monday as investors looked for clues on Friday's Fed gathering in Jackson Hole  Wyo. It might set the stage for Uncle Powell to reinstate his aggressive stance on the rate hike to combat sticky inflation.The Dow suffered a single day's most significant percentage drop since June 16. The same follows for S&P 500. Again  never fighting the Fed is the same mantra that ruled the trading day.🍄Significance of Jackson Hole Gathering🍎Disappointment might be the norm as markets were quickly factoring few rate hikes. The futures market is now expecting a 55% chance that the Fed will hike the rate by 0.75% in September  rising from 39% a week ago.Pika World sees the recent softening of the inflation data point as encouraging. Nonetheless  core CPI may remain elevated than the common inflation metrics  which means the Fed may not pivot to a softer stance just yet.🧸Treasury market took the lead💣The higher short-term interest rates are now powering the 10-year Treasury yield to move higher. This tends to lead to risk-off sentiment. The yield reached slightly over 3%  a level not seen in a month. This makes cash flow on long-term assets such as stocks less valuable. Moreover  they cap the economic demand  affecting business revenue and profit margin.💰Dollar strengthens with bonds📈A logical analysis will take us to the strength of the firmer Dollar. As the US rate rises  investors tend to buy dollars to purchase US bonds. In a relative term  it also punished Euro vs Dollar.Companies will feel the heat of a stronger dollar as revenues are translated back into smaller dollar terms.Pika World now expects markets to be tuned in for a hawkish comment by Uncle Powell as the recent equity market rally paused and reversed to a more conservative mode.🎙What's on the menu today?🧰At 9.45 pm  we will welcome the  Manufacturing PMI for Aug  which is set to remain stable at 52.0.At 10 pm  New Home Sales data for July will be released shortly after. It is expected to moderate to 575K from 590K.At 7 am  we expect FOMC Member Kashkari to speak too.It is August 23  Tuesday  at 9.05 am in Singapore and 9.05 pm in New York. Pika Nat continued to hibernate given the huge loss incurred in meme stocks trade  but Pika World will continue to provide updates on the latest development in the equity market.We wish all friends a good and safe trading week.,btohqsg
