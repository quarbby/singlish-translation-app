but i hope people would heed my advice ah,btohqsg
So unfortunately furthest I can go is to Changi,btohqsg
No  JC more slack then poly. You can play around in. jc and not worry until the end,btohqsg
Tbh anywhr aft sec sch cfm got stress la,btohqsg
Bruh I'm worrying about secondary school and u say I no need worry about jc,btohqsg
I mean if I can achieve financial stability without having to undergo the stress of going to a jc then Iâ€™ll probably opt to not go jc,btohqsg
but your sec sch life is almost over,btohqsg
Then again im scared i scare kids so i wont go for ecde,btohqsg
Yea but if I suffer in secondary  wouldnt I suffer more in jc,btohqsg
In JC you have fewer subjects  less to worry,btohqsg
for people who prefer projects more than mugging,btohqsg
If u chao mugger u can excel in jc,btohqsg
Sounds like u had a great time in jc,btohqsg
If ur good at projects and all ull excel in poly,btohqsg
I've been mugging my entire life but I think it's rather unhealthy,btohqsg
Ye but not all abt mugging ig,btohqsg
er sry what is my username ah,btohqsg
is it my name or a username,btohqsg
Not really  they made it so watered down it made it confusing.But PW was fun though. Some people love it  others hate it. Same goes with economics,btohqsg
i have yet to study much,btohqsg
''Which is not an ambidentate ligand?'',btohqsg
But poly so inconvenient to go lmao,btohqsg
''explain why H2S-SBF6 can react with alkanes',btohqsg
Idk but commute time is so long,btohqsg
JC seems more convenient transportation wise,btohqsg
if you stay close to the poly than it won't be long,btohqsg
Depends which JC and where you live. Very hard to say,btohqsg
well   not everyone face the same problems as you,btohqsg
At this point I cant be picky lmao,btohqsg
Tbh ya true tho i wld sacrifice that for a course i like,btohqsg
Nanyang but not really interested in their courses,btohqsg
See whether I can even make it in lol,btohqsg
Who knows  you might do well in JC,btohqsg
Then why don't you reply immideately every time?,btohqsg
But is poly or jc harder? I know one is mug at the end and the other is consistency,btohqsg
I mean  if you want to sleep well  you still need to be consistent in JC,btohqsg
If you like to worry  then only study at the end,btohqsg
Neither can be said to be definitely harder,btohqsg
Welp I'm just gonna get my results and think about it then,btohqsg
Don't have much time by then. You might make a bad split second decision,btohqsg
Perhaps but with my current expectations  I'm better off retaining,btohqsg
I think it's a bug with the quizarium bot,btohqsg
Where some people can still see the buttons,btohqsg
Try deleting all the messages from Quizarium,btohqsg
I already asked John to delete the most recent one  last time,btohqsg
There is a checkbox to delete all,btohqsg
Here is one of the messages,btohqsg
But then who would know that John is the champion of Quizarium,btohqsg
Hi guys those who took N level last year or previous years  was ur grades reflected inside ur Singpass acc?,btohqsg
