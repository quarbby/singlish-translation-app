YouTrip markup is more like 0.3-0.5% above spot.So not fair to useAmaze 2%Maybank 3.25%YouTrip 0It‚Äôs more likeAmaze 2.5%Maybank 4%YouTrip 0.3%Disclaimer. Ringgit is weird animal for cards. Sometimes funky results for all cards,btohqsg

Would it be right to say that now UOB lady's card and DBS woman's world card is quite similar? Both are now 4mpd.. so which should i choose?,btohqsg
They are vastly different. UOB is mcc specific and dbs woman world card is online only while mcc doesn't matter.,btohqsg
Ah okay okay understood thanks üôÇ,btohqsg
Uob lady can get 6mpd if u put $10 001 into Uob lady savings.Net about 5mpd if u deduct the opportunity cost of $10 001 locked up with no interest.,btohqsg
UoB point valid for 2 years  dbs only 1 year,btohqsg
Uob lady can be used offline as long as mcc is in bonus category,btohqsg
"Im just thinking if I get the UOB lady's and choose travel.. I will be stuck with it for 3 months so not sure if getting a more ""general"" card that earns miles is better",btohqsg
I just applied for a UOB lady‚Äôs and going to use it just for travel related stuff (excl overseas spend). Not sure how that‚Äôll work out.. and with the 2 years expiry üò©,btohqsg

Hi all  when will UOB ONE credit card cashback come in for July to Sep spendings? I havent receive it,btohqsg
I charged $1.8k for insurance and $98 on eligible spendings this month (oct)  will i be eligible for the cashback in july to sep? But im not planning to continue using the card anymore from this mth onwards,btohqsg
Hi folks  I have a question regarding UOB One Card quarterly cashback. I'm aiming for the $100 cashback every quarter so have to spend $1k for every month in the quarter. In the october statement  e.g. i spend $1050 but then i got a cash back of $100 for the previous quarter  this means my statement will be $950. Question - the criteria is based on spend amount ($1050) or statement amount (which is $950)? If based on statement amount... meaning this quarter i won't be able to get $100 cashback...,btohqsg
Once you nv meet the minimum amount  you are not able to get the 1k spending tier,btohqsg
$0no link. Oct spend is Oct-Dec statement quarter.,btohqsg
