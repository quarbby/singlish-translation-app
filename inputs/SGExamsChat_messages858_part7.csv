I watch too much ah boys to men,btohqsg
my NS was good. Still chatting with NS mates everyday,btohqsg
thinking back  near to 22 years + liao,btohqsg
It shld the better one uh,btohqsg
Need worry abt the ippt stuff next yr right,btohqsg
But like I was placed in pretty much the worst unit,btohqsg
better cuz less things. But strong friendships typically forged when chiong sua together for 2 years,btohqsg
The 2nd camp one was cus the unit misappropriated manpower of my previous unit,btohqsg
That camp reflected how much I hated NS.,btohqsg
Like i was meh with it but it turned 180 degrees when i entered the 2nd unit,btohqsg
The third camp pretty much made my life a bit easier,btohqsg
But the 2nd camp was SO horrible,btohqsg
but reservist you should be nothing much also,btohqsg
Thank god I am not in the 2nd camp if I kena reservist,btohqsg
the 9th and 10th reservist  can really feel the age catching up,btohqsg
the new people come inwe can do things much faster and efficiently.but when come to carry heavy loads and walk  really still cannot,btohqsg
"I'm just happy I can ""technically"" say how useful my NS was",btohqsg
Is basically microsoft word and excel lmao,btohqsg
"NS chiong sua is about taking rifle go around fire universal rounds by saying ""bang bang bang""",btohqsg
But that is if you know what is your pes status,btohqsg
"Meanwhile me in NS:""Look I made a report :D""",btohqsg
I rmbed for my jc  pe was seperated btw the girls and boys,btohqsg
So technically we had a portion to focus on ippt,btohqsg
I think if I am not wrong  before the merger  the shirt was white,btohqsg
"But so far I have nvr heard of any case of ""pervertism"" in my jc before",btohqsg
I dont get the context but still funny afðŸ’€,btohqsg
Dunno what Iâ€™m gonna do for reservist as Iâ€™m in the navy and my ship is going to decommission next year  I.e my unit will no longer exist,btohqsg
Like they replacing ships with new ships,btohqsg
Meanwhile my camp decided to build a effing building out of nowhere,btohqsg
I only want ORD and MR,btohqsg
Rmb to book your dental appt if you plan on pulling out wisdom teeth,btohqsg
can always trf u to infantry,btohqsg
Havenâ€™t been in army since BMT,btohqsg
I dumped all my army stuff away,btohqsg
ya but can still hold rifleso can be infantry also,btohqsg
pls god no I have not worn camo since BMT,btohqsg
or they will just equip everyone with green,btohqsg
I will man mode as a 3sg,btohqsg
U know the sad part abt being pes e,btohqsg
You can only max until 3sg,btohqsg
Like they will give you the 3sg rank after bmt and that is it,btohqsg
But that is if you do well during their 5 wk vocation course uh,btohqsg
I had to do all the saikang like NDP and SAF day,btohqsg
The best part abt NS for me wld be not going for BMT for 2 mnths,btohqsg
BTW i am curious have anyone went ns first before joining jc or mi ??,btohqsg
So far  not my jc uh,btohqsg
I scared ltr instead of left leg i right leg or smth stupid,btohqsg
At most wld be those retaking A levels,btohqsg
In every NSF life  BMT is the hardest part,btohqsg
But after that  things go down,btohqsg
