Noticed from the cheap ass proton headlight,btohqsg
Maybe the licensing might be the problem,btohqsg
spending 20 billion at its valuation to shut it is crazy,btohqsg
I meant making it closed source not shutting it dowb,btohqsg
Yeah but they can‚Äôt keep using the old fork,btohqsg
i think its value is in the fact it has 66%+ of the market,btohqsg
If they take advantage of the old forks then DOJ will ban them to,btohqsg
It‚Äôs been really long since I used chrome,btohqsg
the DOJ is also furthering rules and regulations to ensure google does not monopolize the Ai field,btohqsg
Why would you want to stop people from using a fork of an open source project?,btohqsg
I would think they would stop those wanting to prevent people from forking or using chromium,btohqsg
internet explorer has stopped being supported,btohqsg
What I‚Äôm trying to say is that the new owners will stop giving the fork for free,btohqsg
Thats not how that works i think?,btohqsg
They have the advantage of blocking the old forks,btohqsg
Im sure the internet archive has forks of every chromium release anyways,btohqsg
is that browser seperate from the chromium entity?,btohqsg
DOJ or wtv gov authority would not allow that i doubt,btohqsg
if the DOJ passes a rule and they enforce it..its the end for chrome,btohqsg
Each build of chromium will have to connect to the internet and ping the home server,btohqsg
And the new owners can just block the connection for the older forks,btohqsg
Y wld they conceivably do that tho,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs chromium too but they‚Äôre starting to switch,btohqsg
tbf  they have no authority over chromium,btohqsg
U can run it on any server,btohqsg
It‚Äôs open source but it‚Äôs far complicated than that,btohqsg
But I don‚Äôt think the chromium opensource will get sold off,btohqsg
yea but google dont own chromium,btohqsg
so the doj cant tell it to sell that off,btohqsg
Doing anything funny with it wld step on the toes of many other companies anyways,btohqsg
why tf are we so high üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Weird way to end of the year but ok,btohqsg

am i the only one who thinks labubu isn‚Äôt cute,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth close to $200 for one figurine,btohqsg
its just overhyped because of a celebrity,btohqsg
i heard it was due to bp lisa,btohqsg
at the end of the day its just a mass produced plastic figurine,btohqsg
i thought labubu is like some kind of soft toy,btohqsg
i would rather buy a baby alive doll or some kind of barbie doll to relive my childhood,btohqsg
