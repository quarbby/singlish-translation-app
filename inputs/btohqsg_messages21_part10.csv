Need to cancel and lose your flat/queue number  before you reapply for another HFE. Might be wrong though.,btohqsg
can you give a call to HDB or write in via MyFeedback? They may be able to change it internally.,btohqsg

To improve the chances of success  applicants can look for flat application categories with application rates that are lower than the median.,btohqsg
If median is 10. If the rate is 8 will i get higher chance of success for that area?,btohqsg
Tq for the enlightenment. How about this? The median is 8.5. Will i get chance for que number if i apply at kallang. This is for the sbf unit,btohqsg
This means that you will have a higher than of getting this than if you applied for sth above the median (eg Tampines 4 or 5 rm). It's a comparison of your chances across all projects in this launch.You should still look at the number to understand your actual chances. 1st timer for kallang 3rm  is 3.2  so 3 applicants to 1 available flat,btohqsg
Yes. I used to understand if rate number is below 1 will get chance. But then this median info confuse me. Coz not many is below 1,btohqsg
The median would be useful to understand your chances for this projectcompared toother projects in the launch.,btohqsg
I heard that this year will have 3 launches only. Can I check if it is for this year launch only or future also 3 per year instead of 4?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if i cancel my application now  will i be able to re-apply?,btohqsg
Yes as long as before 2359 tonight.,btohqsg
Yes can. Hdb just earn another $10 application fee. Che Cheng $,btohqsg
So meaning the higher the median  the better it is or the lower the better?,btohqsg
Tbh lower is better (my opinion tho),btohqsg
actually no need think so complicated  just see 1 unit how many ppl bidding  example 3.0  simple means that your chance of getting is 33%,btohqsg
Lower. Number high means more people fighting for 1 unit,btohqsg
Hi a question  if the units open is 499  applicant is 1200 and the rate is 2.0 for first timer  what are the chances to get it and how to calculate ? Median is 1.5,btohqsg
