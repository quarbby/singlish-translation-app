Open la  after vaccination won't die one  Cheng hi said,btohqsg
If got die can say don't have the benefit of hindsight,btohqsg
SG also cannot substain with a closed border  i feel the govt have a target in mind when to open full border once the vaccination reach a certain stage. Currently we are at 50% vaccinated level from CNA,btohqsg
Ya the cases precedes the political news we see now,btohqsg
I just realize that you could technically use Star Wars Movie episode title to shoot a movie/documentary about Covid,btohqsg

OUE Comm  fresh uptrend supported by 10MA  anticipating a potential bull flag in the make. If nice shape break out recent high 455  projection around 500. Trading plan: EP 425-440 zone with SL 425 and trailing stop by 10MA  breakout 455 add up.,btohqsg
Raffles Med weekly chart  finally  breakout multi year high of 120  nice strong closing on a Friday. If this uptrend to continue  which resistance to use as a potential tgt? My own view 140 is reasonable,btohqsg
