I don't know I have applied it a lot of times and it still asks me to apply for eGIRO whenever I want to use eDDa for deposit,btohqsg
e.g. If fulfilled everyday+ rewards requirements for Jun (FAST in $2k to EGA and 5 transactions in May or Jun) then get 1% bonus interest for incremental average daily balance in Jun wrt May.If fulfilled everyday+ rewards requirements for Jul (FAST in $2k to EGA and 5 transactions in Jun or Jul) then get 1% bonus interest for incremental average daily balance in Jul wrt Jun.and so on...This is on top of the 4.Ã—% bonus interest promo with fixed reference month (the month before sms registration).,btohqsg
Thanks  incremental balance means new fund for that particular month?,btohqsg
For sharing  I got charged this amount in my card.Fraud transaction,btohqsg
that month average daily balance compared to previous month average daily balance,btohqsg
Meaning  not the entire amount will get the additional 1% bonus interest right?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know when the EGA 4.x% bonus interest will be credited. If I sign up in May  will I get the bonus in June?,btohqsg
if u are May-Aug cycle  you will receive most EGA bonus interest around end of Oct,btohqsg
Thanks. In this case UOB ONE is a better option for $100k,btohqsg
depends on which month you sign up,btohqsg
Today is my last month for EGA since I signed up in Mar. Do you all think it's a good idea to transfer my full sum of money from OCBC over to HSBC for one month to reset my OCBC balance back to 100K the next month (Jul)? right now ocbc already exceeds 100K but I'm still increasing the balance by 500 monthly  so looking for a good opportunity to reset back to 100K. If I compute correctly  I should be getting 5.7% for my HSBC in June so no opportunity cost for emptying the OCBC for one month. Any other considerations I missed out?,btohqsg
actually why u using ocbc as your main savings account? Is the interest higher than ega?,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone know how ssb interest is paid out? Is it to paynow number?,btohqsg
Is 1.8cpm considered decent for citi payall for insurance payment ?,btohqsg
maybe can go for the 2.2mpd promo effective 1cpm,btohqsg
I max out UOB (100k) and OCBC (100k + 500 increase monthly) and + GXS (5k) and balance in HSBC EGA. not very comfortable with EGA as a bit worried do something wrong and lose 3 months of interest so giving it lower priority.,btohqsg
Thanks may I ask which card promo is this for ?,btohqsg
citi payall promo  applicable for all citibank miles/points card  need to meet $8k for citi payall transactions till 20 Aug though,btohqsg
why not UOB 100k the rest into hsbc ega since max for that is 2mil and you can get 4.35% +1% for 4 mths. The rest can put into tbill,btohqsg
yes that's the plan to do for June only. For GXS since 5k maybe just keep it there.,btohqsg
I didn't transfer all earlier as was a bit scared I do any wrong step and don't get all 3 months of interest in HSBC. since June will be just one last month  I'm ok to take the gamble and actually quite confident I did the right steps to fulfill. just wondering anything else I need to consider.,btohqsg
no need to gamble can chat with hsbc staff on the app to confirm,btohqsg
nevermind bah lazy to call and quite confident actually. I like UOB and OCBC also because next month can see the interest immediately.,btohqsg
no need to call is in app chat,btohqsg
just ask did I fulfill all criteria?,btohqsg
good idea if use app I'm ok don't need to wait haha,btohqsg
ask if u are entitled to to promo rate and the bonus interest and confirm the mths that you are entitled,btohqsg
can just online chat and screenshot few days after u sms,btohqsg
ok I need to confirm and have to do it by today since it's the first day of the month.,btohqsg
Hi all  other than using payment services like citipayall  cardup etc.  what will be next best option to pay for insurance?,btohqsg
giro to HSBC for 1% cashback,btohqsg
or charge to UOB one card and use it to qualify for $500 spend bonus  then use HSBC giro to pay the UOB one card bills for 1% cashback,btohqsg
Don't forget to send your SMS to HSBC to activate EGA bonus interest for this cycle,btohqsg
Have the same question but for Great Eastern!!,btohqsg
