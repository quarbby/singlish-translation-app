no but this type of post will just invite ads,btohqsg
The pt is to keep things as non commercialised as possible,btohqsg
so now cannot even ask for tuition?,btohqsg
cuz its just fishing for invitations then we need to remove everything,btohqsg
so in the end we opted to just ban the posts,btohqsg
then how r ppl gonna find tutors ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
i mean the sensible ppl r gonna like pm them alr la,btohqsg
yes but now u took down the post,btohqsg
But like we dun rly want tutors to go arnd advertising to students in dms,btohqsg
Isn't that beyond your control uh,btohqsg
Yeah that one is beyond our control lol,btohqsg
But we dw ppl to come to the post and start posting like,btohqsg
wait i still dont see whats wrong w asking for tuition,btohqsg
it counts as a subset of advertising,btohqsg
Everytime ppl ask for tuition recommendations it clogs up the feed,btohqsg
Theres q a large number every week,btohqsg
U just dont see cuz we take them down very fast,btohqsg
If they wanted to find tuition they cld hv searched for posts from long ago,btohqsg
before we decided to ban recommendations,btohqsg
For all we know  it could've been outdated,btohqsg
but everyone has their own specific requirements?,btohqsg
how uk they nvr search b4,btohqsg
yeah but like generally we try to discourage ppl from overrelying on finding tuition,btohqsg
so uw become like the ccp,btohqsg
if they want to find it's up to their own discretion so,btohqsg
to be against what many students want?,btohqsg
its not against its more like nudge but if they want to find ok lor,btohqsg
u cant pander to everyone sometimes,btohqsg
if possibly the only education socmed channel isnt available,btohqsg
Cuz i took down the post,btohqsg
Sometimes u cant see the post if u just send the link after post removed,btohqsg
cos they dw ads in general,btohqsg
but asking for tuition isnt an ad??,btohqsg
its not abt the asking for tuition part its abt what it invites,btohqsg
actually im just arguing for the sake of it lol,btohqsg
So like its administratively easier to be taken down,btohqsg
and ask them to pm or smt,btohqsg
Then whats the point of the post,btohqsg
We can lock the post sure,btohqsg
But it takes up space on the feed üíÄ,btohqsg
Which was one of the original problems,btohqsg
the feed is alr very spammy,btohqsg
this doesnt even concern me LOL,btohqsg
didnt i say we get a lot of tuition recommendation posts üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
it is when the avg sgexams day is like 50 posts,btohqsg
doesnt make the feed much more spammy,btohqsg
this is going in a circle üíÄ,btohqsg
i dont have to go camp tmrw,btohqsg
when ur not the one driving,btohqsg
that was the most interesting part,btohqsg
