Definitely don't withdraw.. you put in stash account is like you got extra cash that's why you stashing it one,btohqsg
ya not touching unless super emergency...but can withdraw it back too 100k..?,btohqsg
You need to withdraw what they credit on the day itself to make sure the MAB is 100k every month,btohqsg
Like now your MAB is higher than 100k already if they deposit yesterday and didn't withdraw.,btohqsg
Not worth losing the bonus interest next month to reset to 100k,btohqsg
jialad..in on Dec 1..i haven't withdraw..now the over 100k excess still inside,btohqsg
actually there are other savings account with better interest and flexibility to withdraw. No reason to use stash unless using it for uob savings promo,btohqsg
alamak..so just leave it first till Jan 1...then withdraw i think?,btohqsg
3% interest rate is really not worth racking your brains for,btohqsg

That one also max out 100k right,btohqsg
