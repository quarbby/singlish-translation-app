Itâ€™s like the made in China version of entrepreneurship,btohqsg

I think study at TP or NYP may be the best,btohqsg

RP is the only polytechnic that has daily grades  which can be super annoying when the daily grades become 60% or 100%You only have one day to submit the worksheet and RJ for each lessonAnd  for many modules  you have to take class test (known as Practice Questions) right after the end of lessonFor NYP  the deadline can be slightly longer  so I think that you don't need to feel much stressful (I think TP also) (but I'm not sure if this depends on the course you're taking or not)And don't have to take class test right after each lessonAnd for both NYP and TP  you will get full notes (can't remember if it's before or during the lesson)  which unlike RP,btohqsg
My Fren say sp not bad,btohqsg
Also  do update us with the new stickers  okay!,btohqsg
Your poly should depend on the field that youâ€™re interested in,btohqsg
