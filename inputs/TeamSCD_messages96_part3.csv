For me I went toThe brake shopI going there soon for Overhual brake,btohqsg
And remember if changing BBK or SSBH pls change all 4Many would advise only change front can liao which is wrong,btohqsg
why need change all 4 leh,btohqsg
i also heard many for longest time say change front can alr,btohqsg
SSBH change all 4 bah. Bbk usually front enough. But obviously dont do F6R1 pot haha,btohqsg
4/1 is fine for most applications. Also make sure its compatible with your brake master cylinder.,btohqsg
When u press on the brake pump the pressure is distributed to 4 wheels if only change front the stress pressure will go to the rear and the efficiency drops,btohqsg
Coz rear is still rubber hose,btohqsg
BBK front ok more then enough. If wan more balance just change the pads for the rear so when u brake hard the rear help to maintain balance,btohqsg
Correct hahah. But again dont do 6pot f and 1 pot r AHHAHA,btohqsg
