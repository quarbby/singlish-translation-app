Failed after few days when fund deduction.NoNo,btohqsg
Likely is your card was locked? If not  only Citi CSO can tell you the reason.,btohqsg
i will check with them again. thanks alot,btohqsg
Can I know ur process?So every end day around 1030pm onwards  u will record the balance of the day? N do it every single day eh?Then next month u will just do a new column n see tt the daily average has a $500 difference from the previous month?,btohqsg
No need. As and when you feel like doing it  or you know exactly what are the transactions you going to have this month  just log into ibanking and record it on excel and calculate the amount to top up/withdraw.I usually do it once a month only  on the first day. You can do another round on the last day as well just to be sure.,btohqsg
No need record everyday  it is actually very simple.On ocbc ibanking web it tells you A) ‚ÄúCurrent Month's Average Daily Balance‚Äù and B) ‚ÄúAverage daily balance increase vs. last month‚Äù.Assuming u log in today  and see A) 100 100 and B) 400.It means:- last month MAB is 99 700 and this month‚Äôs MAB  must be > 100 200- then u just need to pluck into excel. 1st - 13th dec: 100 100- then just find an amount to put from 14th-31st dec such that the avg will be 100 200- that number will be $100 272.22- so u just need to have 100 272.22 from today till end of Dec,btohqsg
There is simple math calc to get 100 272.22. In any case can just use chatgpt to calc for u üòâ,btohqsg
This is the excel I made. Target cell for each month is previous month MAB + 500. Colored cell is current month MAB - target. Green color shows that current MAB - target >= 0.1.Then just have a daily transaction column. If you have a transaction  the daily balance will adjust automatically.,btohqsg
Can see that I usually top up on 1st day on the month  if it is a PH  or somehow I forgot  just top up on any day. And the top up amount may not be $500 even if I do it on the first day. On Oct  the first top up of 495 on 2 Oct already makes the Oct MAB 500.1 more than Sep MAB. But as I have a deposit of $180 on 20th and did not withdraw on the same day  I need to withdraw more later ($240.1 on 23 Oct).,btohqsg
got use autosum and auto average? haha,btohqsg
Just simple sum/average formula. The colored one took me more time to do it.. üòÅ,btohqsg
u never count for 29 days? Leap Year this coming feb..haha,btohqsg
This is my old Excel. My new Excel will auto count number of days based on the name of the month. üòÅAnd can actually dun care about number of days. Just leave the cell empty if that month don't have the date. Average function in excel will cater for that...,btohqsg
hi  i noticed my standard chartered jumpstart for debit card for transactions being made with amaze is not counted to the cashback  does anyone know if this would be correct?,btohqsg
U mean topping up amaze wallet?Or linking debit card to amaze?!,btohqsg
ooo like making transactions with amaze being linked to sc jumpstart debit,btohqsg
Wow I didn‚Äôt know u can link a debit card to amaze. Let‚Äôs see what other users say.,btohqsg
i will categorise under like general items like bedsheets and massage chair,btohqsg
but the amount wasn‚Äôt reflected in the cashback and noted the large discrepancy that i was expecting for this month haha,btohqsg
What is the MCC shown on Amaze for the transaction?,btohqsg
i just checked at the amaze app it is 5734,btohqsg
This is strange. Unless you've reached the $60 cash back cap. Otherwise think you can contact SC to check on that.,btohqsg
yea really weird  okie i will check with sc to see what‚Äôs their take on  thanks!,btohqsg
Hi  just opened a UOB one account recently. May I ask if I use the UOB card to pay for my insurance  does it account to the $500 spending?,btohqsg

hi all. planning to open uob one savings account  and credit my salary thereAlso planning to spend on uob one visa credit card to meet the criteria for the 5% IIR on the uob one account. I don‚Äôt care for the cash back on the uob one visa cardQuestion - if i set up recurring payments e.g telephone bills  internet bills  conservancy fees  utilities etc on the uob one visa card that adds up to $500 per month  will that fulfill the min spend criteria for the uob one account to get the 5% IIR?Thanks!,btohqsg
there will be confirmation email..deposit funds in..anytime before the closing date,btohqsg
conservancy fee no  the rest ok. The exclusions for card spend for bonus interest and rebate are the same  except insurance count to bonus interest but not rebate. Why not clock for both?,btohqsg
i just want to ‚Äúset and forget‚Äù i.e automate that $500 spending req as much as possible üòÖ only aim is to meet the bonus interest criteria,btohqsg
bro..one account don't need to maintain MAB same figure as previous month  or higher right?unlike the stash accout  i meant..,btohqsg
