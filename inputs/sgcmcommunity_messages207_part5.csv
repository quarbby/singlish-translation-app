They say 20k over a few years  but everyone feel its majority of the 20k gonna be 2025 and 2026,btohqsg
Then after that it's another mad rush. Early Next year already have auto show again,btohqsg

Best of all  just count 2024 how many big auto shows. Then there's this byd's aggressive marketing  and roadshows at shopping centres  buyers dun need to go showrooms anymore,btohqsg
These will keep coe high especially govt increase count aiyah I feel disgusted saying that  cos if break it down  the increase will effectively dissolve into the demands,btohqsg
Dealers will say dun worry  govt increase coe  quick buy now dun wait,btohqsg
Most impt factor is that buyers are not afraid and willing to pay,btohqsg
COE increase is because buyers r willing to outbid each other,btohqsg
Every extra $10000 is only $120 extra a mth for 7yrs before interest,btohqsg
If I have buffer of extra $250 a mth  tht wld translate to a whopping extra $20+k to play with the COE,btohqsg
