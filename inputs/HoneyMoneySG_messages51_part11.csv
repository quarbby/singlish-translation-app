For the benefit of those who also intend to transfer CPA IA agent bank:I visited UOB at Raffles Place on a weekday afternoon and the procedure took 1.5h (mostly waiting for my queue number to be called though I was just the next number). At the queue machine  I chose the ‚ÄòInvestment/Insurance‚Äô option. Was initially served by Staff A but then got handed off to Staff B.I was asked by both Staff A and B whether my personal particulars were updated in their system. Staff B also asked to update my signature with them since my account was created online and they had no record.For the actual transfer  I had to fill in a form - to be signed as per DBS‚Äô records. I couldn‚Äôt rmb my signature style so I asked if I could sign 2 forms and Staff B permitted that. She advised that if the signature is rejected by DBS then UOB would call me (mostly via a private number).I was also advised not to operate the account in the next 2 weeks.Then I walked over to RB Capital building to use the DBS VTM to update my signature (immediate effect).Finally done and fingers crossed UOB doesn‚Äôt call me! üòÇ,btohqsg

If I want to use citi payall to pay my income tax bill  and use ega giro to get my 1%. I have to submit the manual form to HSBC? or is it citi side? And what's the typical methods to submit the manual form and estimated wait time for the giro to be setup,btohqsg
citi side. mail. for citi quite fast  about 1 month,btohqsg
Ah OK  is it correct to assume giro forms typically submit to recipient side. Anything on the HSBC side I need to do also? Other than make sure got enough funds,btohqsg
yes recipient side. HSBC side need to fulfil requirements for everyday+ rewards before giro deduction to get the 1%. Transfer in $2k to hsbc ega  make 5 transactions (e.g. fast out to another bank),btohqsg
Good Day  May I ask for advice  I‚Äôve used $600 on my uob evol card on wireless & tapping of Ezlink etc.So if I still need to use for other payments  what card should I use? Amaze + citi rewards?,btohqsg
Not sure what do you mean Evol on wireless n tapping of EZ-Link? Tapping EVOL physical card (paywave) will not earn 8%(6.667%).Evol best use is online n using mobile contactless (using ApplePay/GPay or iWatch).,btohqsg
Ya. I made payment using my Apple Watch most of the time. To tap wireless & ezlink.,btohqsg
wireless meaning online? tapping of ezlink meaning tap phone for bus/mrt?You redeeming flight using points from citi rewards? Would u have enough points to redeem flight by the points expiry? If not better to go with cashback cards. Can get DCS Ultimate Platinum mastercard for 2% without min spend.,btohqsg
I will use my Apple Watch to tap for paywave & ezlink functions.I have not used any miles storage credit card before. And seldom fly too. üòÇProbably I‚Äôll go check out on cash back cards. üëç I‚Äôm currently holding citi cash back + card.,btohqsg
tapping mobile contactless only get 8% for $250 spend  you have online spend for 8% on another $250 spend? then need another $100 for others/mobile contactless/online to make up $600,btohqsg
Anyone here have any issue with Amaze? I got rejected after successfully applied and transact. Then they kick me outü§¨ those points that I incurred is gone üò≠,btohqsg
I seldom do online spend. Maybe Shopee only. I think Shopee top up using paynow will be a better choice  cos got the coin back?,btohqsg
if dun do online and only do mobile contactles then effective cashback is only $20/$600= 3.33%. Actually quite a lot of things can be online e.g. pay telco pay  favepay  shopback pay  kris+  buy vouchers on shopback  use fairprice app linked to applepay etc.,btohqsg
What did you spend using Amaze card?,btohqsg
