yes need to do HLE which has a validity of 6 months   can apply for grant as long as you have worked continuously for 12 months prior¬†to the flat application,btohqsg
list down your criteria for a flat  top choice is normally to avoid the sun facing units,btohqsg
but usually it is the last of the list,btohqsg
oooo whatever is left as long not next to the chute,btohqsg
same situation as me. they will take your average for the past three months. but they will email/call you to provide more information (e.g. payslip from jan to mar) but it‚Äôs on a case by case,btohqsg
if you have worked consecutively for a year then no issue for getting HLE as it requires you to work consecutively for 3 months,btohqsg
However when I apply for HLE they need 3 months payslip. I just provide the one month that I have and my cpf contribution can since there is no gap?,btohqsg
how can there be no gap when you only have one month payslip,btohqsg
U just provide what U have.  Anything missing can always upload again in myhdbpage at a later part. Just remember to submit before the deadline given,btohqsg
The previous company I didn't download the soft copy payslip before I left. So I don't have the previous company payslip,btohqsg
It's from the internal HR portal that we have ü•∫,btohqsg
still she has to approach the previous coy for the missingpayslip,btohqsg
ask the HDB can they just refer to your CPF statements,btohqsg
I was thinking. I'll call on Monday to check,btohqsg
Ya I think this one should be possible.  Maybe ask HDB to confirm will be better.,btohqsg
Okay thanks thanks! I will call them on Monday ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
can approach your nearest HDB branch to ask  but they also need you to book an appointment see whether can just ask them one question without checking in,btohqsg
I'm going back to school every 3 months,btohqsg
i didn‚Äôt have for mine too! you can write in and they will email you an income undertaking form to be uploaded,btohqsg
they will just need your CPF statement because from there they can roughly gauge how much you earn and then your declaration on the form,btohqsg
about 65x of your combined pay equals to your loan amount,btohqsg
Usually how long will u guys/ people wait after the flat is just completed and renovated to move in ?,btohqsg
Im considering about the renovation works from neighbours . Will it be too early if i just move in after mine is renovated ?,btohqsg
why the wait before settle in?,btohqsg
my mum's current house  we shifted in even before the reno was completed due to the auspicious date and tight timeline of 6 weeks between key collection to shifting home,btohqsg
Because my friend told me they moved in right after their reno is completed because their neighbour's renos are still ongoing   its unlimited amounts of noises during the day time and cleaning of their own house,btohqsg
we were lucky because our neighbour left their house vacant before they rented out their flat after 6 years,btohqsg
haha thinking to ask my new neighbours when are they going to reno their house should I meet them after key collections,btohqsg
Your bto don't have a group chat?,btohqsg
know also no use since most of the new home owners are probably renovating their house at the similar timeline,btohqsg
I think there's no perfect answer la. It's more of which one more urgent. I know of some who are renting while waiting for their bto to be completed. I'm sure these folks will move once their reno are done.,btohqsg
Im also planning to move in once my reno is done . Just that idk whether will that be a good idea . I dont like to wait either ü§£,btohqsg
maybe you can wait for your neighour beside you  opposite you  on top of you and bottom of you to finish reno before you commence your reno,btohqsg
Depends on the needs of yourself and your family unit.If u have to move  u have to move. If you wanna avoid the Reno works of your neighbours and have the available living space else where to do so  u can opt to do that. It's really up to the persons wants and requirements  there isnt a most ideal move in timing or period.,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask is there a possibility for HDB to assess the combined income before 12 months of employment? My understanding is they count at the point of application. But we only a few days to reach 12 months of employment. Anyone has similar case to share? ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
means you haven't applied for HLE yet?,btohqsg
I think u can appeal to them to consider,btohqsg
I m assuming this is for the EHG?,btohqsg
Bcos they sent me thiss so im assuming few weeks will not be ‚Äútoo big a deviation for them to consider a waiver‚Äù,btohqsg
usually first HLE they just wanna know your situation like what u are doing,btohqsg
the serious HLE is when u collect keys  because thats where the loan kicks in,btohqsg
if u are just paying downpayment  they need HLE to see if u can afford the 10%,btohqsg
Not yet  have not booked the flat.,btohqsg
Did you email HDB or how you appeal to them? I wish to ask hdb for wavier too,btohqsg
I went thru nyhdbpage and use the myrequest portal,btohqsg
Ok! I did the same thing too. Hope Hdb Will review my case! üëçüèª,btohqsg
Questions.  Q1.  Will renew of HLE takes long time?.  Q2. In the normal situation   from receiving letter to keys collection is how many weeks. ?  Sorry  maybe is a repeated Questions.,btohqsg
1. within a week 2. can be as fast as a week,btohqsg
best is to give some buffer for the HLE,btohqsg
2 weeks apply for it before your appointment,btohqsg
