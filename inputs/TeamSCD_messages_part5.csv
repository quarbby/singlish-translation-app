driving a forte koup myself haha  no issues for me,btohqsg
Issue with forte mainly is ecu ba,btohqsg
My previous cerato quite ok... 09 Manual one. At first keep going left  change to coil overs then can go straight. Also ignition coil died once. But that's about it.,btohqsg
ECU I did the preventive maintenance thing at harmony. But now when I think Abt it  expensive to do that,btohqsg
Ya. Generally cerato family is fine,btohqsg
Drove once. But it did gave me some nightmares,btohqsg
