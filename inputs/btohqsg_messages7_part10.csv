to answer your qns I think no affect with your chance in may sbf since the ballot result is soon to be out in the next 1 week which is before your appt..unless your appt is before the release of the May SBF results,btohqsg
since no more unit to choose your FT status remains,btohqsg
First time giving up chance to select won't have any effect on May SBF,btohqsg
Ahh I see  cant advertise is it? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Try lor. Won't be that easy to implement. No capital gains taxation in Singapore.Repercussion too severe.,btohqsg
Anyone got result for sbf may 2021 ?,btohqsg
not yet  but should be in the coming days i suspect,btohqsg
Anyone got groupbuy groups to share?,btohqsg
You wanna advertise your service to them? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Dont think they have group buys but their content quite useful,btohqsg
Hi  just wondering if anyone has collected keys from nov 2020 sbf?,btohqsg
Some of the ready projects in mature estates..?,btohqsg
have you logged in your hdb to check,btohqsg
Hi. Has anyone here changed their telephone point to data point? Any review?https://www.carousell.sg/p/1094656099?utm_source=copyLink&utm_medium=sharing&_branch_match_id=731850874360218547,btohqsg
Don't know about other BTO but my mum's TOP in 2007 has every bedroom  living room  kitchen and even bomb shelter equipped with the data point,btohqsg
Saves the hassle of cable exposing everywhere,btohqsg
See which bedroom needs router  just connect through the ports shown,btohqsg
I do it everyday  sometimes twice daily,btohqsg
All rooms data point are preinstall by HDB? All my friends unit are install with CAT6 cable conseal inside the wall but terminate with telephone port. They were advicing me that the wall are thick that most WiFi router are not able to cover the whole house from the main. Hence is better to get it convert.,btohqsg
So through this  the laptops and desktops in the rooms are having wired connections?,btohqsg
Haha I don't know how effective is this,btohqsg
Wifi mesh is better than router,btohqsg
OK shall try it once I shifted home,btohqsg
OK will set that up for my new home,btohqsg
To put it simple explanation  those working in big offices  they are using like mesh instead of router.If offices uses router  we all sure cannot work and the network sure jam jialat.,btohqsg
For better illustration  I'm living with my gf  my sister  my brother  my sister in law and my 2 parents,btohqsg
Everybody can stream play game and get on multiple devices without much lag,btohqsg
Data points of your house not preinstalled? No concealed cable within the walls?,btohqsg
If u do this with router  none of u are gonna do anything online,btohqsg
But still need router for wireless devices.,btohqsg
But just that this can provide stable connection to the laptops and comps,btohqsg
But OK leh my speedRouter in my bedroom which is the furthest away to the main point of the living room,btohqsg
Unless you don't need WiFi on your smartphone,btohqsg
My friends watching show and playing game from android TV box from his room and even stream 8k from YouTube. The picture is cool,btohqsg
And I think he do away those TV antenna. Just mewatch app to watch local program. Look much neater without those wire. Just dun understand why HDB has some flat install with data point and some flat install with telephone point when the line are already CAT6 Cable,btohqsg
I also want to make a spare bedroom as an entertainment room,btohqsg
With sofa bed so to accommodate any guest staying overnight,btohqsg
Hopefully the covid situation improves and maintain.,btohqsg
One person use?If no one is between you and the router  ur speed will be optimised. If you start using devices in-between your router and your further point in your room  your furthest point will get affected v badly.,btohqsg
I mean that's my experimental use for quite a few years. Cos I'm an avid gamer so latency is the one thing I hate. As my house have many people  I always have issue when trying to game with router. That's why I switch to MESH.,btohqsg
But ofcos! If this works for u then ok la. I guess there's many factors. Most importantly is you are comfortable and you are getting the most of it.,btohqsg
Sorry tech noob here  how does mesh works?,btohqsg
Only 4 person  I seldom connect to WiFi anyway  so it's technically 3 users under the household,btohqsg
Then router should work fine :),btohqsg
Hmm so a router should suffice after I shifted into my 3r flat since there would be only my wife and I staying together,btohqsg
Mesh works like how wireless@SG is.U can surf and it won't lag. But ofcos wireless@sg lag bcos they cap the speed.But if u walk around the whole building the speed is the same.,btohqsg
Yup!! Best is with antenna. It does help with amplifying the signal.,btohqsg
Ahh  so this one have to sign up with the ISP then they will set up? Currently i am using 2 routers at home to improve the signal strength in the bedrooms  with the main point (the one linked up to the fibre optics cable) being at the main door ,btohqsg
U can buy yourself from challenger.ISP have mesh also  but theirs may not be good.,btohqsg
Wth all this tech so hard to keep up with sia hahaha,btohqsg
