i dont follow starlets that much,btohqsg
at one point in life  i wanted one,btohqsg
used to have that generation starlet during my childhood days... thats why when we got this one my dad say cannot let go,btohqsg
starlet was the first car he bought for my mom,btohqsg

I rmb this story i heard from my friend,btohqsg
When he met his wife when they started dating,btohqsg
she was driving an NA MX5,btohqsg
then they married  got kids and they had to sell the car,btohqsg
but the husband promised to buy a MX5 back for her eventually,btohqsg
He bought the ND gen couple years back for the wife,btohqsg
But the wife drive a few years and said it's enough and decided to sell it,btohqsg

Heard the reliability not good tho,btohqsg
I think renaults are fine  but rare until parts cannot find,btohqsg
really meh  had an ex colleague the car forever in the workshop,btohqsg
but if F1 has taught us anything  Mercedes are damn reliable lol,btohqsg
i go workshop always got mercedes on the hoist,btohqsg
the engine in my old cerato really didn't give me any trouble for the 2 years i had it,btohqsg
the car generally was pretty reliable  it was just slow,btohqsg
and was known for ecu failure,btohqsg
the one that looked like a jaguar,btohqsg
right after warranty over the gearbox circuit board fried,btohqsg
Komoco didnt cover cos warranty over,btohqsg

That car really became a big problem,btohqsg
my family didn't touch hyundai ever since,btohqsg

Before this she was driving an accord. I vaguely remember the car,btohqsg
