"""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate  our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light  not our darkness that most frightens us. You playing small does not serve the world. There was nothing enlightened about shrinking  so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine as children do. It's not just in some of us  it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine  we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear  our presence automatically liberates others.""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO9070EWdS4",btohqsg
should I just send the whole message,btohqsg
"""..always reject fear. Instead  clothe yourself in faith and confidence. If you do that and embrace the ""light"" in you  you will find that you will handle problems and issues that emerge in each paper in a way that utilises the best of what you know when you go into your exam zone of mind with good vibes and a positive heart.Yet  this necessarily begins with a focus instead on what you actually know and have. Accept that nobody can be 100 percent ready for anything. So it is important that you remind yourself that you have done your best to do what you can  given your circumstances. That you actually know more than what you care to give yourself credit for. More importantly  that you have learned and grown in the last two years in ways you haven't even quite fully comprehended. This is true of life more broadly  and not just with taking a major examination.So  go *rock* the examinations and have fun --- yes  actually enjoy the challenges of resolving problems! Treat it as *a celebration of your growth* and the knowledge and wisdom you've acquired in the last two years. I was telling some of you to treat these upcoming series of examinations like a rock star on a multi-stage world tour and to enjoy and have fun at each stop along the way.Because if you don't  you will just be mostly hiding your own ""light"". The ""light"" that the student talks about in the video clip is our individual potential  virtues and strengths. In a sense  It is our hopes and our dreams that we fear the most  because we want them so much that we fear that we may never ""get there"". Sometimes it's too difficult; but mostly  it's just that we are unsure of ourselves and therefore deeply insecure. And so  we respond in a variety of ways that may not always be too constructive and instead veer us both farther and further away..Don't let your fear hide your light. You've worked too hard and hustled too much. Be bold and take your place in the arena. It's your time to shine -- and lift everybody around you as well. ""-wise words from my teacher",btohqsg
nah exams are just cambridge torturing children,btohqsg
TOO BAD I TAKE PURE BIO,btohqsg

If u Talkin abt elect right I think cold war appear in every seq without fail sia,btohqsg
2021:Sbq: Stalin industrialisationSeq: nazi (Nuremberg laws  Germans supported Hitler because of culture of fear) or cold war (bay of pigs  Korea war)2020:Sbq: Jews in nazi GermanySeq: soviet union (great terror  collectivisation introduced to destroy kulaks?) or cold war (Berlin blockade  cold war came about because Stalin scared of western powers)2019:Sbq: Stalin's purgesSeq: ww2 in Japan  cold war (grand alliance  end of cold war)2018:Sbq: Reichstag fireSeq: soviet Russia (purges  economic policies failed?) or Korean war (divided post ww2  USSR involved in Korea war to protect North Korea?)2017:Sbq: CMCseq: impact of ww1 (why tov unpopz in germany  lon failed to protect security) or cold war (why us involved in Korea war  did containment fail?),btohqsg
lots of stupid acts done i feel,btohqsg
Unless seab decide to be damn funny and test stalin,btohqsg

They gonna have 3 12 m qns choose 2,btohqsg
anyways categorised the set text into different themes,btohqsg
more importantly must be able to link the different themes together and make a mature response out of it,btohqsg
Will like 6 highlights suffice for the main themes?,btohqsg
Small brain cannot remember all the themes,btohqsg
how u bring set text if highlighted?,btohqsg
Highlighting and underling allowed  inscribes disallowed,btohqsg
i didnt know l highlighted text is allowed,btohqsg
Lay out all the different themes,btohqsg
read through the set text again and then compartmentalise it to the different themes,btohqsg
sometimes different events consist of multiple themes this where u link them up together,btohqsg
if u know the set text inside out highlighting key events suffice,btohqsg
more importantly is to practice writing the essays as examiners look for your response instead of story-telling,btohqsg
hard at first but will get the hang of it,btohqsg
iirc it felt really stupid at times (ahem hitler in ww2) cuz the things people can do is really nonsensical at times,btohqsg
as yes 2021 when they had 2 hybrid questions,btohqsg
Mf rly shot himself in the foot multiple times,btohqsg
yea it does get really stupid at times HAHA,btohqsg
me when i make all my generals report directly to me when i have no prior military experience,btohqsg
Like cmon la cheating on Stalin is💀💀💀💀,btohqsg
But he stupid don't listen to generals still true,btohqsg

i think my brain is a rokc,btohqsg
i heard theres econs in theme 2,btohqsg
but all the others maybe not,btohqsg
cfm got the food security one right,btohqsg
Supply shock -> decreases supply -> shifts the supply curve leftwards  decreasing quantity supplied and price of good,btohqsg
there r two types of problems in this world,btohqsg
this sounds like an econs problem,btohqsg
but ngl i was doing econs the whole week,btohqsg
cause i havent read my regen...,btohqsg
and i have a regen essay due...,btohqsg
I willingly do her every day,btohqsg
i only know the first sentence of regen,btohqsg
I'm degenerating every time I touch Malay Literature,btohqsg
Nah  nah  Imma incur the prudence concept now,btohqsg
is it rlly the mind or the self or the self,btohqsg
at this point i think i need regen notes,btohqsg
It's really the (lack of) 90RP & Heartbreak,btohqsg

to go from knowing nothing to distinction yes,btohqsg
in terms of *amt of practice*,btohqsg
aim is distinction not 100 :/,btohqsg
decreasing qty supplied and increasing price of good :),btohqsg
ok maybe love when one of ur essays miraculously gets an A,btohqsg
W subject when u get the A,btohqsg
as a geog student history W,btohqsg
geog is a L in exams also,btohqsg
but the difference is no exam geog L too,btohqsg
i took geog in sec 3-4 despite being better in hist :/,btohqsg

Past topics  u can try spotting but got chances weird topics come out,btohqsg
my cher said some topics won’t come out so like I’m confused,btohqsg
like he said those outbreak of Europe eg they won’t test,btohqsg
oh if it comes out for ur sbq confirm don't come up in seq,btohqsg
I’m not sure  that’s what I heard also from him so jst wanna confirm,btohqsg
Lemme msg my hist Cher idk if she'll reply tho,btohqsg

Sbq for elect only can be- Stalin- Hitler- Korea war- cmc,btohqsg
If they not in sbq could be seq,btohqsg
Lol I thought u mean seq then I'm like,btohqsg
cmc need to rem the dates damn sian,btohqsg
like the 1st 2nd letter wtv lol,btohqsg
Hi guys i need some form of inspiration to brainstorm  what are some aspects of limitations in the healthcare / medical sector that yall can think of ( aside from cost and manpower ),btohqsg
when hospitals got overun and respirators had to be chosen for specific patients essentially becoming a death sentence for those with no respirator,btohqsg
"Clinical trials and testing typically take a long time to complete. Delays ability to treat patients. Quite amazing that Covid vaccines were rolled out as quickly as they did.Treatments and medication tends to favor the average person. There are people with unique conditions that typical treatments can't address  and it's ""not worth it"" to develop treatments for them.On a more social front  some important roles like nurses are not that appealing to locals  so many filled up by foreigners. May not be a sustainable practice  and doesn't help if patients are xenophobic.But I'm not in the sector la so don't have to take these as fact",btohqsg
:0 okay thanks   ill try to think of smth,btohqsg
is it possible to talk about how the healthcare system exacerbates social inequality  as poor people spend a larger proportion of their income on healthcare than the rich? but can rebut by using SGs example of CHAS or sth idk,btohqsg
That one wld be hard to solve sia,btohqsg
Covid vaccines are actually under emergency use  they didn't exactly go through the same route as typical drugs.,btohqsg
But it is true that usually pharma aim to release blockbuster drugs that target big illnesses like cancer and such coz it sells better. Rare genetic conditions  especially those only seen more often in 3rd world countries usually not a popular topic.,btohqsg
Do y'all think there is a major class divide in Singapore,btohqsg
yes i think there many videos about this on youtube,btohqsg
also take a look at the gini coefficient  how many singaporeans are going to be millionaires-- compare their living conditions compared to the bottom 2% of singaporeans,btohqsg
How should Singapore lower the class divide,btohqsg
Hello!! Please pm me if u need 2021 Emath  Amath  Elective History papers or good study notes. My senior is selling her papers and notes at a discount 😬,btohqsg
i mean depends if u consider foreigners into the equation,btohqsg
cuz a bunch of rich ppl like to come sg to buy properties and stuff (and coincedentally a lot of foreign labour that dont earn much tbh),btohqsg
Has Korean War been tested in N levels?,btohqsg
Cos I only know that Korean War has not be tested for 20 years?,btohqsg
What about if we consider only singaporeans,btohqsg
im not too sure tbh but im p sure theres things like gini coefficients as mentioned above etc,btohqsg
not only depending on courses  depending on ur ideal campus,btohqsg
because it’s okay to mistreat the foreigners who build our flats and clean our streets?,btohqsg
i mean if you go work at an area like tanglin you'll know,btohqsg
they can easily spend 1 day of your wages within 5mins without batting an eye,btohqsg
then back in your neighbourhood town when you go volunteer you see old people struggling to maintain a proper living space to live or sleep in,btohqsg
so ye  class divide quite bad here but still not rabak like other places,btohqsg
Bukit Timah a lot of rich people,btohqsg
Frfr tho they be spending my whole month pocket money without blinking,btohqsg
bukit timah rich pales in comparison to cluny area,btohqsg
Its a very surface level observation,btohqsg
Go a bit further think about the why,btohqsg
Wealth is more about who you know,btohqsg
And the elite schools help the rich kids form connections,btohqsg
wealth is about who you rob g,btohqsg
Good now go a bit further  what are the implications,btohqsg
They bond and interact with other rich kids,btohqsg
in an ahbeng school u make what kind of connections sial,btohqsg
rich can get you school  internship  headstarts  political influence  etc,btohqsg
If you want the answers you should read NTU Soci Prof Teo You Yen’s book this is what inequality looks like,btohqsg
That's why I'm looking for a rich girlfriend,btohqsg
being able to buy into startups via connections thus creating generation wealth,btohqsg
you don't just hold a stake in a company that hasn't ipoed as a civi 😭,btohqsg
and those fundraising platforms half the stuff there is bleh also,btohqsg
Lemme give you a perspective to look at.How do feedback loop between families and jobs help to perpetuate poverty and inequality,btohqsg
Look for a rich boyfriend or girlfriend to help get your way into the upper class,btohqsg
Its not very obvious but if u can see the link u will realise a lot of other things,btohqsg
To be fair the only rich kid I know her family worked their way into wealth,btohqsg
Both of her parents are doctors,btohqsg
they bet on one sibling only,btohqsg
then they manage to wing it,btohqsg
Turns out having 2 doctors are parents is a easy way to get rich,btohqsg
I should have told my parents to become doctors,btohqsg
it does take hardwork for the parents to be docs tho,btohqsg
but yea usually its rich parents --> rich kids and so on,btohqsg
i work with a doctor for practice once,btohqsg
bro read the wrong pulse on the aed,btohqsg
To be fair yeah her dad is quite a good surgeon,btohqsg
some of them like slack one lah,btohqsg
He got so many awards it's funny,btohqsg
He was also on the news,btohqsg
oh landed property rich rich then,btohqsg
the aircon in ceiling one also,btohqsg
When someone ask you what colour your Ferrari is and you ask which one,btohqsg
i work opposite a place where the apartment is worth a few ferraris,btohqsg
imagine you go work get flexed on,btohqsg
Go interview some low ses people bah,btohqsg
I go study at SP bro,btohqsg
After school see so many international school kids,btohqsg
Their shoes worth more than my entire fit,btohqsg
They wear watches more expensive than my pocket money,btohqsg
seeing he international student makes me feel good about myself,btohqsg
i know generational wealth breaks after knowing him,btohqsg
They pay $10K a year btw,btohqsg
Rich people tend to fail upwards,btohqsg
My chem cher smart af still lives in hdb,btohqsg
Ask him go work at AC,btohqsg
Actually do u know the school fees for those schools compared to bad schools?,btohqsg
I think those schools earn a bit more then,btohqsg
actually sg a lot of talents but ambition not much,btohqsg
they can easily wing it and take all but they pick passion over all that money,btohqsg
they go for degrees that don't really pay well,btohqsg
so ye they can choose to gloryhunt  then if they do we all gone already,btohqsg
Do high SES folks tend to forget their Asian heritag,btohqsg
They seem more western then other s,btohqsg
Basically useless unless you wanna be some museum person,btohqsg
Didn’t know that history & art useless degrees,btohqsg
One of my PHIL seniors got an 8k salary at a private equity firm as a fresh grad and she's doing it for fun,btohqsg
Obviously there's no such thing as a phil job unless you're going into academia,btohqsg
How does PHIL train her for private equity firm jobs,btohqsg
The rest of the recent grads idk what jobs they have  ik some go post-grad over seas,btohqsg
PHIL has nothing to do with private equity. They hired her because they were looking for highly logical people,btohqsg
If you want a major that is 100% related to your future job  don't come to PHIL .-.,btohqsg
I wanna go into cyber security,btohqsg
That's my pathway to upper middle class,btohqsg
Hopefully my kids can go to those IP schools I keep complaining about,btohqsg
I think IP schools form elitist echo chambers,btohqsg
But also I want my future kids to get all the advantages possible,btohqsg
You didn't see the convo before this?,btohqsg
Assuming you have a partner to bang,btohqsg
"""I"" sounds like a personal conviction",btohqsg
In the wise words of Joteo,btohqsg
“You don’t need space to have sex”,btohqsg
A joke of a father should be enough,btohqsg
yup  they want a think thank machine,btohqsg
Does anyone know when I should start my nafa/lasaelle portfolio?my o levels end this year,btohqsg
Yo i ask yall ah  how many of yall know about shopeepay deals near me feature,btohqsg
but let's say u run the country. how would you solve a class divide? what has sg tried and how successful has it been?,btohqsg
I can lick I can ride it I go slippin and slidin,btohqsg
The best time to do it was yesterday,btohqsg
Do I believe in equality of outcome? No,btohqsg
But I do believe in equality of opportunities,btohqsg
well said. and yet sg scrapped estate tax a few years back,btohqsg
Personally I believe that move was self serving,btohqsg
other things sg tries (does it work?)- everyone in sch wears sch uni- everyone mixes in NS regardless of class,btohqsg
The majority of MPs are very wealthy,btohqsg
They literally scrapped it to benefit themselves,btohqsg
ns only proved that everyone is equal  but some people are equaler than other people,btohqsg
Every school is a good school type beat,btohqsg
Every school is a good school but some schools are obviously better,btohqsg
"""better"" for who? ""better"" for you may not be ""better"" for me :)",btohqsg
that is technically arguable if one wants to  but NS literally states without a diploma or JC cert equivilant you are barred from OCS and lowered chance for SCS,btohqsg
Got Diploma and JC also hard,btohqsg
good point re: OCSeven in civil service today  your academics affects your highest job level,btohqsg
nah i dont recall that  at least to my memory  they usually just want approx 75 rp and above etc,btohqsg
is that bad? (another popular essay qn),btohqsg
Are all MPs out of touch people looking down from their ivory towers?,btohqsg
is this for like some GP thing lmao,btohqsg
But they also in the vast majority of cases don't really understand the struggle of every day singaporeans,btohqsg
no  this is just a chat cos midautumn is lame :),btohqsg
Do I think every rich kid had every success spoonfed to them?,btohqsg
They probably worked hard to get to the school's they are in,btohqsg
But also they probably had more resources,btohqsg
i mean  if you have a can opener with you  you wouldnt use your bare hands to open a can isnt it,btohqsg
Did you still work to open the can? Yes,btohqsg
what makes u say so? need to justify saying this if u bring up the point,btohqsg
But you had a easier time,btohqsg
countries like china  aus  US straight up give you extra points for being of a different culture or even fucken being gay,btohqsg
But also I don't have to worry about my finances,btohqsg
Or if my parents have enough money to send me to school,btohqsg
Or if I have to work part time while studying,btohqsg
We are well to do enough that I own 2 laptops one for home one for school,btohqsg
yeah. there may be a class divide  but if u can show everyone in the country has some minimum standard of living better than in many other countries  arguably that's good enough?,btohqsg
Is it good enough? I don't think so.,btohqsg
Is it better than other countries?,btohqsg
do u believe it is better to have zero class divide?,btohqsg
I believe it's better to have no class divide,btohqsg
countries that have zero class divide include north korea,btohqsg
think carefully. do u believe it is better to remove all incentive to compete?,btohqsg
what exactly is the change you are trying to drive here?,btohqsg
No  I just think it's better if everyone competes on the same playing field,btohqsg
And some people aren't given a headstart,btohqsg
i argue that there is an optimal level of class divide,btohqsg
just like there is an optimal level of crime,btohqsg
Is it communism to believe everyone should be given the same chance to succeed?,btohqsg
If so then I suppose yeah,btohqsg
no  Joshua has a good point. Joshua's solution is quite ingenious. use inheritance tax to wipe the slate clean every generation and start afresh. why not?,btohqsg
if u are born in a less fortunate background  yea life will be harder for you. and? so ?? whats so bad about that? just work harder/? why adopt an entitled mindset that u must be given the same opportunities as everyone?,btohqsg
I believe 20% is a good number,btohqsg
and 20% is supposed to create zero class divide? are u listening to urself?,btohqsg
I believe we should have 0 crime,btohqsg
you could have zero crime but make life a living hell for law-abiding citizens. is that the best option?,btohqsg
Yeap  good one  settling and comparison is not the same,btohqsg
It wouldn't be 0 class divide,btohqsg
looks like u just changed your mind :),btohqsg
If working harder was enough then everyone would be a millionaire,btohqsg
Connections and networking plays a huge part,btohqsg
why would u think everyone should be a millionaire??,btohqsg
aren't we all in sg millionnaires?,btohqsg
I don't think everyone *should* be a millionaire,btohqsg
"because there is a concept known as ""your estate"" and that would be a big infringement on that. our economy was built upon the british common law system  and to do that and revamp the whole legal system would be to tera down the house if the door knob fell off",btohqsg
I think everyone should have a chance to be one,btohqsg
very good point! this destroys property rights,btohqsg
i claim everyone in sg is effectively already a millionnaire,btohqsg
and the right to property  if you think about it  is the most important thing next to magna carta lmao,btohqsg
yes  it is what Deng changed to unleash the economic giant that is China today,btohqsg
Do you think that someone born to a roadsweeper has the same chance of being a millionaire as the son of Lee Hsien Long?,btohqsg
"does s/he need to be? i think a lot depends on how you define ""millionnaire""",btohqsg
I believe they should have the same chance yes,btohqsg
china already had property rights   it was more of privatization of industry,btohqsg
in sg  everyone has access to a quality of life that they would need millions to achieve in other countries,btohqsg
"to clarify  i can have a chair  or a sofa in china  but not a ""skaven fan cheese making factory inc""",btohqsg
How many people here would consider themselves born into a upper middle class and above family,btohqsg
im aware and acknowledge the advantages it brought me compared to my peers,btohqsg
but i would say it aidded me  i had to open the can too  just with a nice little can opener,btohqsg
however  the elite top 1%... that might be argueable,btohqsg
I also am aware that my family has did their best to get be the best can opener they can,btohqsg
but we are talking about CRA which should not even be remotely the norm,btohqsg
It may not be the best can opener,btohqsg
But it's a pretty good one,btohqsg
yes  so its ridiculous to demand everyone throw away the can opener; USSR tried that and damn did it go well,btohqsg
I'm not telling everyone to throw away the can opener,btohqsg
I'm saying those with can openers should share their can openers with those who don't,btohqsg
singapore reasonably actually have decent social upflow,btohqsg
Instead of everyone not having a can opener,btohqsg
How about give everyone who needs one a can opener,btohqsg
i have a friend who im really proud of  he started with nothing and a piss poor family with an abusive father,btohqsg
but now he works at tik tok,btohqsg
Doesn't change the fact that he is the exception,btohqsg
nothing  sadly for singapore it brings problems for bto,btohqsg
Ur literally saying what the boomer are saying tho,btohqsg
his point is that sg disadvantages the community,btohqsg
hmm to bring in an exception is to bring in a comparison. are you trying to compare it with the singapore population or the world population,btohqsg
NS dont ask dont tell policy,btohqsg
Singapore ineligible for BTO and adoption,btohqsg
general social stigma and psychiatric/psychological support,btohqsg
I mean as long as u dont go around and announce ur gay to the whole world  nobody will bother u  lol,btohqsg
thats.... dont ask dont tell. why cant he be proud of what he is? that is the problem,btohqsg
"you are literally suggesting dont ask dont tell as ""fair""",btohqsg
