But say real  uh carros and sin ming autocity got alot,btohqsg
Can see like r32 and stuff if u interested,btohqsg
how long a khanjali can tahan 5 stars,btohqsg
was walking there once for work,btohqsg
dual svj pulled up in matching liveries,btohqsg
this is like slapping BRABUS AMG CARLSSON on a C180,btohqsg
How do you do this someone teach me,btohqsg

i tot is sat and sun,btohqsg
Means if we buy one day pass only can go on which day?,btohqsg
Or can go either Saturday or sunday,btohqsg
ohh then tht one nt sure,btohqsg
i think the ticket u buy for is meant specifically for tht day uh,btohqsg
anybody looking to buy? dm me,btohqsg
is it a diff car or what cuz ik theres an yellow mk3,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s a white and thereâ€™s a yellow,btohqsg
owner always respray every 2 weeks,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve seen two go on sale in the market before though,btohqsg
Unless they are the same cars,btohqsg
The owner make two listings of the same car ðŸ”¥,btohqsg
Welp ik where he stays now,btohqsg
last i saw a yellow mk3 was at yishun,btohqsg
The white and yellow is diff plate though,btohqsg
Ones a classic car plate and ones a regular playe,btohqsg
yeah u can get 2 plates under your name,btohqsg
Changes between a classic plate and a regular plate???,btohqsg
Ya then when uw drive the car js tell LTA,btohqsg
Cos classic only can drive a limited amt of time per year,btohqsg
So when the owner need then he change,btohqsg
But why wld u buy a classic plate den put a regular plate u pay lower COE for classic,btohqsg
the owner told me he havent register the other one stil waiting for approval,btohqsg
nvm i looking at wrong thing idk,btohqsg
Den it donâ€™t make sense to get a regular plate?,btohqsg
but regular plate means can drive everyday,btohqsg
was at yishun fr few weeks,btohqsg
Ya itâ€™s like how my R33 got classic plate then my Corolla is regular,btohqsg
LTA wants people to drive classics more,btohqsg
Then ifuw drive the R33 can apply switch,btohqsg
thatâ€™s why they encourage them to drive everyday,btohqsg
classic cars or classic car plate,btohqsg
yep this is the newer one,btohqsg
but can still get the plate rite,btohqsg
that's why the mk3 got 2 plates,btohqsg
This u got see b4 anot,btohqsg
