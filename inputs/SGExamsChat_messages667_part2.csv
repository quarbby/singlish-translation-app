true  over time i have slowly realised that there is no point arguing with stubborn people over the internet. if u know u r right  and u throw facts at people and they still don’t want to change their opinion  then just stop wasting ur time  energy and mood. they are not your mother  father  not someone that you care about  not even your dog  don’t need to put in extra effort to educate them,btohqsg
