Hi all. Pertaining to UOB Evol  it seems like streaming services MCCs are not disqualified as eligible merchants according to t&c. Does anyone know for sure if this charge will earn the 8% or am I better off charging this to SC smart card for 6%?,btohqsg
You need to check what is the mcc code of the merchants. You can search using either merchant name or mcc code at:https://heymax.aiThe website will also propose a list of best credit cards to use  then you can check credit card TnC is it in whitelist or exclusion listGood luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg

Hi all  I am thinking of buying a car  need to pay $13k booking fees(via credit card)  $85k down payment (cannot use credit card) and $1k monthly installment. Pls advice what is best option to optimise for me. I have maybank friends and family and premier world mastercard  HSBC revolution and EGA account  uob one and lady card  Citibank Cashback  ocbc premier visa infinite infinite and 90¬∞  posb everyday. Anyway to also benefit from EGA 1%? I am thinking the monthly installments can properly charge to uob one and meet the monthly $1k spend and get the 1% EGA giro Cashback for paying the uob card. I have no idea which option to pay for the $13k booking fee and the $85k downpayment at the moment.,btohqsg
Is the date same for everyone?,btohqsg
If its me  i will use these 2 cards for the $13k and spilt on 2 separate months. E.g  Sept 2023 ($2800 hsbc $3700 stanchart) then balance Oct 2023 ($2800 hsbc $3700 stanchart).1. hsbc advance credit card. Cashback rate 2.5% capped at $70 (minimum $2001  maximum $2800 purchase / month) + qualify for EGA 5 transactions with $5k incoming (other bank) for extra 1%. Add it to instarem amaze for extra 0.5% before charging.2. Standard Chartered Mahanttan World Master Card for extra 3% cashback capped at $200 (minimum $3000  maximum purchase $6666 /quarter). Add it to instarem amaze for extra 0.5% before charging.,btohqsg

For life insurance u want to choose an insurer which is very stable and u know won‚Äôt go out of business since u are probably buying the plan for tens of years.If u look at the credit rating of fwd and u can also proxy it by the yields of the corporate bonds they issue  fwd is not among the strongest of insurers.,btohqsg
