I am going to apply to MI. I heard that MI is only $6/month and has higher chance of going local uni. You also have 3 years to think about questions at a scenic pace and the cost in MI is less than in university because the MOE tuition subsidy only supports 4 years. If you prefer to extend to optimise results it is therefore less costly to do so in MI. You could also do this in JC if you retained or failed GP at the A level (and hence repeated J2).,btohqsg
