A golf without pops and bangs is like nasi padang with no side dishes,btohqsg

Whats the range for second hand cars interest rate? Normally its higher than first hand cars right?,btohqsg
no  can be same  depending on which bank you get from,btohqsg
in house financing will usually be much higher  and COE car will be higher than PARF car,btohqsg
Planning to get PARF car at car choice. Any idea whats the interest rate?,btohqsg
can see from sgcm when you go to the financial section when browsing,btohqsg

Im looking at the red or black one,btohqsg
nama you ytd just say your rims very nice,btohqsg
I today go fix tyre i see the rims red i like,btohqsg
Do remember that these interest rates will only apply if you downpay 40% or more. But bigger dealers like car choice may offer you in house loans to make the deal look better at lower dp amounts but higher interest rates,btohqsg
Pls don't get this one. It is the most common wheel in Singapore at this point,btohqsg
Every single shop from the good tyre shops to petrol station wheel shops is selling this design,btohqsg

Soya milk spilled! HaisAnyone has a great idea to eliminate the odor besides charcoal n baking soda?,btohqsg
Baking soda is actually very effective for these kinds of things. If the fabric bits is not wet  then you can just wipe your mat and pour an even (decently thick) layer of baking soda and leave there for about 2-4 hours. After that  just vacuum it up and you should be good as new! Otherwise you can try those extractor cleaners but don't spend too much money  can try and get a detailer who has one to do it,btohqsg
Hope it's thick enough plus the charcoal hippo,btohqsg
Alrdy jet spray clean the mat yesterday,btohqsg
Waaa lol ok later i do again,btohqsg
It's a waste of baking powder but it's worth it,btohqsg
Suntan and air the car a bit,btohqsg
Make your mat look like a Geisha,btohqsg
Throw away the car n buy new one,btohqsg
It may help  but might not do much also,btohqsg
You can throw to me lah  it's okay,btohqsg

Soaking in dettol for 3 hours also the dettol lose ü§£,btohqsg
Wife complain why let my friend with strong perfume sit in the car,btohqsg
I pull the seat belt  close the door and put into a bucket of baking soda until my security at my house think someone play prank,btohqsg
Guess no harm in trying hahah,btohqsg
Haha! Sprinkle Liao then The whole box of baking soda put inside the car.,btohqsg
I just dumped 2 bags of baking soda in ü§£,btohqsg
I think the bucket had like 4kg,btohqsg
Mix mix like mixing lamian into sauce HAHAHA,btohqsg
I have a lot cause I use baking soda to clean things at home haha,btohqsg
Cabin filter oso shd change I think,btohqsg
Err I think no need lah but can if you want  no harm  cabin filters so cheap,btohqsg
or go to a detailer ask them to steam cleaning,btohqsg
and baking soda i thought have to use with vinegar,btohqsg
I had a bad smell in the cabin and had to change cabin filter 3 times in order to remove the smell,btohqsg
The cabin filter will absorb the foul smell and the smell gets recirculated in the cabin i,btohqsg
