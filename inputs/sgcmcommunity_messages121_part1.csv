@SGCM_Adminconsider verifying if the sale is legit or just clocking numbers,btohqsg
I wouldn't trust that after seeing my own car changed as sold even though I'm still driving it,btohqsg
Also it doesn't help them much to mark it sold just for the sake of it because the listing expires,btohqsg
He's a friend of my friend,btohqsg
My friend‚Äôs friend is the owner,btohqsg
It helps clock sales to be most whatever there is in sgcarmart,btohqsg
I just didn't expose the dealer that's all,btohqsg
Then maybe our friend not the same,btohqsg
Idk if anyone really looks at that?,btohqsg
You 2 can private check them can know already,btohqsg
I on SGCM just to look for my next car,btohqsg
People need to stop ghosting me sigh,btohqsg
Unless you want to add on a 4th car,btohqsg
The rate of them ghosting me,btohqsg
So I‚Äôm gonna look for another shitbox,btohqsg
If can find one that isn‚Äôt heavily molested and a good price,btohqsg
Ngl base model impreza also in my choice,btohqsg
They still can find a full time job and get additional MP pay,btohqsg
You can buy Á†¥ËΩ¶(Porsche) = broken car üòú PDK can endure abuseüòúüëç,btohqsg
Wa anyone knows if u make a feedback on road users flaunting rules,btohqsg
but you got so much time to report meh?,btohqsg
I damn triggered with one golf  he from filter lane just speed never even stop to check,btohqsg
you cfm the one posting on sgrv every week or something,btohqsg
I sometimes see accident or ppl cut i also bochap alr,btohqsg
Not me to do TP job sia,btohqsg
Flouting or flaunting sia? Two very different meanings üòÇ,btohqsg
I assumed he meant flouting lol,btohqsg
brother like this one then you report,btohqsg
Anyways you can report to TP but they will take at least 9 months to investigate if it doesn‚Äôt involve accident  injury or death,btohqsg
i think you more sensitive than TP alr,btohqsg
I reported my own car getting damaged by an insecure object flying from a truck. I only got a reply 1 year after my report,btohqsg
But the outcome thankfully was a positive one and the driver was charged,btohqsg
Personal gratification ‚â† teaching a lesson,btohqsg
they are literally making money selling negativity and stereotypes,btohqsg
and by posting  you're just promoting their platform which may come bite you in your backside someday,btohqsg
Uk if he said sorry afterwards as I drove by instead of staring at me as if im wrong  i wudnt be so pissed abt it,btohqsg
No positivity from me today. Shall just report TP feedback channel then,btohqsg
How to say sorry sia ?,btohqsg
I drove past him and i slowed down,btohqsg
Or double hazard but nope decided to stare right at me,btohqsg
You nv show him the international sign   hahaha,btohqsg
try meditation  you seem to have a road rage issue,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ yeah I do but u dun see me on the roads cus i type only. No action. Not worth to go to jail for such people,btohqsg
I think in general meditation helps u calm ur mind. Relaxes ur body too~ did it last time,btohqsg
Curse and swear in the car. It helps,btohqsg
Some driver very funny 1   they like to tailgate but doesnt want to over take,btohqsg
this and just think maybe the fella eat mala need to go toilet to calm yourself down,btohqsg
ü´†ü´† if i alone okay ah. If with people i think sometimes just hold it first bah,btohqsg
that tends to be the case when they don't want to overtake on the left and you are hogging lane 1 usually,btohqsg
May his LS made him sleep and hug the toilet bowl for a night,btohqsg
