maybe because the school genuinely sucks?,btohqsg
dont discount other peoples experiences lmao,btohqsg
imma put it this way. even good students from those schools wouldn't be so delusional for the most part to claim their school is amazing or whatnot. end of the day it comes down to whether they wanna use their resources given. but as an outsider  dogpiling and just jumping on the bandwagon of shitting on them is stupid,btohqsg
ik of 2 of my classmates in yijc,btohqsg
The only Yi friend I have at least can attest the sch is crap lol  cos students with bad results plus bad leadership,btohqsg
my friend in yijc alr mugging to get  70RP,btohqsg
The bad leadership part can also perpetuate the cycle of students with bad results. At the same time  itâ€™s possible that moe will just let things be status quo and not bother allocating more resources and better leaders to yi,btohqsg
ive also seen some guy from y3 ri talking about how theres people straight up fapping in his class,btohqsg
It's also one thing to flame Ur own sch cuz U would know what sup w Ur sch more,btohqsg
and hes from raffles  the students there are horrendous,btohqsg
its BOYS from INTEGRATED PROGRAM what do you expect,btohqsg
your flaming is just jumping on a bandwagon,btohqsg
Oh ya shit forgot the RI section is boys only,btohqsg
also their schools mostly suck because their a level reshtsare horrendously trash,btohqsg
since its only post jc students,btohqsg
to have done at least 3 months of GP,btohqsg
IP boys are either model student (100 ECs  class president  gold medal for IOI) or the most ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ people you'll meet (say n word in class  do weird shit to girls),btohqsg
so we should all be able to think rationally,btohqsg
Yo today my gp teacher not here,btohqsg
i genuinely dont get why ur metric for how good a sch is is just how well they do for a levels,btohqsg
you lump every single student in a school together  jump on a bandwagon to flame them  and go haha no offense xd,btohqsg
I should sell my gp exercises,btohqsg
hey this is what i do to vjc,btohqsg
wait let me show u dmth,btohqsg
ya you suck too it's ok,btohqsg
then the new students themselves believe they are just as bad as them and the cycle repeats,btohqsg
i heard from@phxrqthat somebody got rejected from such an easy combi because they didnt take a math or pure science. are you actually serious  you didnt take a math or pure science  and you want to do double science and h2 math? no wonder you got rejected,btohqsg
also i genuinely hope people know my vjc thing is a meme,btohqsg
i actually dont rly care abt vjc,btohqsg
i just dont like some students from thr,btohqsg
must be delusional to think you can do h2 double science and h2 math if you didn't even take a math or pure science.,btohqsg
gude that's a great sticker pack,btohqsg
what makes you think you can catch up,btohqsg
why is taking pure science a requirement for h2 double science,btohqsg
in EJ u can do h2 double science with combined science,btohqsg
yeah but you need A1 for that stuff,btohqsg
and my friends who did it got A for both their sciences,btohqsg
Iirc right the subj pre req for sci is actually just combined sci,btohqsg
my physics tutor say his best students are the combined science ppl,btohqsg
ya thats what i thought also,btohqsg
if you got rejected it means youre genuinely giving yourself too much high hopes,btohqsg
i dont know what shit you are talking about,btohqsg
this is what i would recommend my students to do also,btohqsg
"its better than""go read the news and find out what happened today""",btohqsg
i feel like comb sci ppl may put in more efforts to catch up so they more hardworking and its good also cause they not complacent,btohqsg
Afaik for combined chem the only real bridging they needed was for titration,btohqsg
just need see the comments she gave lor,btohqsg
also got ppl taking h2 math with no amath,btohqsg
It's not the end of the world,btohqsg
you will need to do a lot of catching up since h2 math is built on a math knowledge,btohqsg
