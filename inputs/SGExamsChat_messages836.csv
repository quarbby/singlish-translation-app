Oh ok that leads to the next issue,btohqsg
sorry u don't give NA vibes to me hence my assumption,btohqsg
Bro i looking at ite coursefinder and the worst course that shows up for emb3 is like 14 points,btohqsg
Theres no way someone with like 18 points cant get into ite so like wtf,btohqsg
you looking at higher nitec or nitec,btohqsg
The filter doesnt show the option,btohqsg
if you're looking at the more popular or niche options in ite courses to select for whatever you do after N level result day (i forgot what u call option day for secondary students looking to get into poly or ite after they finish their national exams),btohqsg
it's definitely unlikely to get into such courses with a mere 18 point aggregate,btohqsg
my brother also scored about 18 EMB3 for his prelims without even factoring his o level subjects which don't get released at the same time,btohqsg
so we worked on just what we have,btohqsg
Bro but like 18 isnt even a fail for NA level,btohqsg
And absolutely 0 courses show up,btohqsg
according to the course finder or course booklet,btohqsg
the finder isn't as accurate as the booklet given to you,btohqsg
don't look at the course finder on MOE's website,btohqsg
it's not even as updated as the one on ITE's official course finder website,btohqsg
So the website is just shit la,btohqsg
i mean i use the normal ite website,btohqsg
Ehh the ite website got no score filters tho,btohqsg
I think the moe website only show higher nitec courses thats y,btohqsg
you go to a course you want  not go to a course that is easiest to enter,btohqsg
Just filtering elmab3 and na level without typing in any score will only show 18 results,btohqsg
no point go to a course that you can easily enter but spend 2 yrs not liking what you are doing,btohqsg
moe & official school websites will definitely have different filtering systems,btohqsg

r even year papers easier than odd year papers,btohqsg
Tbh i have no clue but all i rmb is 2019 paper 2 math was excessive worded(non-numerical) explain answers,btohqsg
ermmm i think there's theories about that circulating before but it's usually shut down due to the baseless reasoning if it's an actual speculation discussion on the likelihood of itfor national exams (not just a levels bah)  a lot of students in the odd years feel like it's a lot tougher than the even year papers,btohqsg
like for some reason the odd years always have some kind of surprise topics for most of the subjects..,btohqsg
hi guys does anyone by any chance have the n level amath paper one?,btohqsg
Same thing every year  people are publicly asking for the paper immediately after a national exams.The newer members won't know that one person was sent a warning letter by SEAB few years ago for sharing some papers on this chat after the exams.Maybe should add into the rules or pin a message not to ask for papers of national exams immediately after the paper.,btohqsg
Sorry but how do they get access to those papers? Isn't it illegal?,btohqsg
wasn't there a rule made on the r/sgexams reddit about sharing the whole of national examination paper? maybe it's fine to implement across the other sgexam platforms as well,btohqsg
iirc a lot of students on r/sgexams reddit tend to be very lowkey with discussing exam questions after that incident,btohqsg
In my opinion  discussing and distributing papers are totally different things,btohqsg
It feels like they are solely asking for the paper rather than discussing it,btohqsg
yes that's the case but it's often blurred between the lines before something actually happens when someone gets caught for illegally distributing papers,btohqsg
Ohh I see..I didn't know it worked this way but I see a possibility,btohqsg
yeah  it's not just distribution vs discussing but generally people will think two matters may be similar in nature but not realize that they hold different meanings in most situations,btohqsg
Some teachersfor the subjects request for the paper,btohqsg
isn't that more for the teachers' internal reference and discussion,btohqsg
because if they were to publicly share the questions set in exams not even a day after the test for said subject has wrapped up  it can escalate into something nasty,btohqsg
Yeah they are not allowed to discuss or share the materials with their students,btohqsg
"usually teachers just love to tease the students with ""im very.. disappointed/happy with the results of most of the class results"" if they happen to be in the marking team",btohqsg
i used to think it was pretty dreadful but now i would rather get spoilers for how well i do rather than not knowing at all until results day,btohqsg
at least most teachers can roughly estimate students' strengths after teaching the same subject for a classnearly a whole year down the road  i reminisce about secondary school school days but time will never go back to the past (even though i didn't have a life in school for the most part  i cherish the memories made over there),btohqsg
actually you should know how well you do,btohqsg
yeah but getting someone else to gauge your ability is more interesting to know of and listen from someone other than yourself,btohqsg
i like to think this somehow applies with the logic of why doctors don't treat themselves,btohqsg
life there is bad but still cherish?,btohqsg
maybe it's just me being somewhat sadomasochistic qwq,btohqsg
hello  current a level student. anyone have/know of any internship/event opportunities can lmk thanks,btohqsg
how do u even get it actually?,btohqsg

Best u can do is revise those concepts,btohqsg
I think if I am not wrong someone a few yrs back also sent the actual listening comprehension recordings on youtube. It got removed after,btohqsg

earlier someone asked for it and in another chat someone else already finished it as a practice paper??,btohqsg
for sgexams? you can checkhttp://t.me/SGExamsPortalalso in the group description,btohqsg
most likely school teachers get the papers and photocopied it.Otherwise really is leak. lol. but then given how strict is Singapore I doubt it la.In Malaysia one  yearly got SPM Leaked Papers and conspiracy theories. that one listen until a norm already.,btohqsg
idk why i cant access the other channels ü•πü•π,btohqsg
you must do something to verify first,btohqsg

And this kinda thing ig the hod oso drc,btohqsg
most of the schools just close one eye if it happens within school grounds,btohqsg
if its outside school and somehow the information gets leaked  usually someone else will take the blame rather than the original leaker,btohqsg

im bout graduate with a diploma..alr  my next sem i heard its AI,btohqsg
Uni they will touch in the first mod if you're CS,btohqsg

Ah ok yea then that makes sense,btohqsg
but i realise before graduating that what i learnt in POA  was going to be completely remodelled,btohqsg
basically  my batch was the last run for the old POA syllabus,btohqsg
The biggest chance was POA paper not being used for the new syllabus because students no longer had to learn how to do trial balance,btohqsg
r u in the 2020 batch ?,btohqsg
cos i think 2021 was the start for new syllabus,btohqsg

I was told that I almost burnt down the chemistry lab during O level prac :D,btohqsg
Hey at least you were not the clown that randomly did a pop sound,btohqsg
Or the kid that burnt the wooden pliers using the Bunsen burner,btohqsg
Oh.. and also not the kid that connected wires to the battery body itself then wonder why the volt meter is not showing anything,btohqsg
wtf  are all these experiments things that you know or witnessed personally,btohqsg
Then when the teacher told said kid to connect to the ends‚Ä¶bro was like ‚Äúthe clips keep falling out‚Äù,btohqsg
Bro was clipping using the tip of the clips,btohqsg
bro probably doesn't pay attention in practical lessons,btohqsg
Bro has nvr touched one lmao,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like clipping coins using pliers but instead of clipping it sideways,btohqsg
I rmb got one fren during normal class he clip the ammeter from the top,btohqsg
idk how to feel about experiments going wrong in exams,btohqsg
The one that burned the wooden pliers yea have not seen fire on wood,btohqsg
did your friend realize it later,btohqsg
The whole time all I see was his pliers above the flame  the glass tube he was holding was not even near the flame,btohqsg
Someone needs to get their eyes check,btohqsg
Oh please don‚Äôt get me started,btohqsg
Some kid decided ‚Äúgently‚Äù meant turning on the Bunsen burner slightly,btohqsg
He put the test tube and waited for a long ass time to only realise  his flame did not even exceed the metal protrusions of the Bunsen burner,btohqsg
TLDR: imagine the flame you see from a lighter Coming from the Bunsen burner and kid thought the flames could reach hisüß™ .,btohqsg
my eyes aren't as bad as this,btohqsg
i think i failed all my experiments as well,btohqsg
