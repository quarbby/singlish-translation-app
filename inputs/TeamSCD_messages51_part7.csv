Just a small misunderstanding only ba. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,btohqsg
But tbh  not a lot of ppl know road hogging is illegal. Soooooo. Just over take and go beh. 😂,btohqsg
Usually tp don't fully enforce on road hogging as people keep it within speed limit. Thats why people will have that mentality thinking I'm at the max speed limit on lane one and you still want poke me  then people get angst about it.,btohqsg
That's one way how road rage happen also,btohqsg
You only road hog when a big ass lorry driving on lane 1 or 2 to just slow them down and let them return to their respective lane to prevent unwanted accidents,btohqsg
If can  even if you are within the speed limit and on lane 1  then the behind vehicle is creeping up and started poking you  change lane asap as a soon as your left lane is clear.,btohqsg
This is why tp always says if you are on speed limit or within or not  try to stay at lane 2 or left as possible to prevent unwanted road rage and accidents.,btohqsg
Haha if road hog lane 1  drive at speed limit... Someone faster comes from behind confirm Kenna say tailgate one mah.One want to drive at speed limit  don't wan to change lane. The other wants to go faster  but don't wish to overtake by left.,btohqsg
Actually also see how near you stay behind,btohqsg
Let me try to fully rephrase in road rules chapter section form,btohqsg
Expressway/Road trafficRule 5(1) Drive at slow speed and failing to keep as close to the left and side of the road as possible  First offence $1000 or 3 months jail term.Rule 5(2) Drive in such manner as to obstruct vehicles moving at higher speed  First offence $1000 or 3 months jail term.,btohqsg
Lesser known laws are more of need to enforce to prevent unwanted road rage ma,btohqsg
If stay far = thinks it's okCome closer but not too near = I should move asideVery near = wtf this feller doingVery near + high beam = later upload video,btohqsg
