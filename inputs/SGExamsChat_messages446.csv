Search millennia institute on google for the best school ever,btohqsg
oh change from finance to this ah 🤡😂,btohqsg
I have had MI students scoring well at A levels.Last year A level  top scorer at my side for Physics MCQ was 29/30  student from MI.It's the students  not the school. Agree with Jay.Concluding withH2 Maths and H2 Physics are easy subjects to score. 😂,btohqsg
search h2 geography on google for the best subject ever,btohqsg
Master the analytical skills within H2 Maths. Use the analytical skills for your future personal financial management.,btohqsg
GIC & Temasek sure made some poor investments. Can’t believe two of their investments failed on the same day!,btohqsg
they may have made poor investments  but they still greatly outperform 99% of the world.,btohqsg
Nah. When two failed on the same day   it shows a lot abt their strategies,btohqsg
crying tears of joy taking it,btohqsg
Google parent Alphabet said it will eliminate about 12 000 jobs  more than 6% of its global workforce  becoming the latest tech giant to retrench after years of abundant growth and hiring.The layoffs will affect jobs globally and across the entire company  CEO Sundar Pichai told employees in an email on Friday  writing that he takes “full responsibility for the decisions that led us here.”https://bloom.bg/3kwNmeT,btohqsg

and the course i want igp just increased from 3.67 to 3.71 ffs,btohqsg
How do i study for physics,btohqsg
And i have almost everyth to catch up on,btohqsg
Slay pocoyo is here to save me 🙏🙏,btohqsg

Assuming you get GPA 4 every semester,btohqsg
at a sec sch level if you have the basic understanding down you can grind it out to build intuition,btohqsg
but idk where your current difficulty lies,btohqsg
imo   if you have any doubt   just watch KhanAcademy and questions example solve,btohqsg
Physics is easy. But many people over complicate it.3 common problems by students1) Can't visualise concepts flow2) Can't extract information and data from given scenarios3) Can't explain questions properly in the way that examiners wantJust need to settle all of the 3 problems. You are done.,btohqsg
More tips  I type slowly.This works for Physics a lot.You have to complete the topical TYS. Not just before O or A levels  but as you learn your chapters. For my students  I have observed that at A levels  almost all students who did this consistently scored a consistent A or B.At O level  it's very heavy on explanation questions. You have to study all the common explanation questions that are commonly tested. That can be done by doing many prelim papers and looking through overseas Cambridge papers and answer schemes.,btohqsg
but depending on the course quite hard to get 4.0 for every sem,btohqsg
its possible but legit u gotta work,btohqsg
I can't sell my book directly here  but I would say that was how I came out with the contents... By looking through over 200 prelim papers and Cambridge papers.Do that and you will notice a pattern that always appear for questions. The pattern always repeats. The marks are always the same. The scenarios are always similar.Occasionally you will get new styles of questions  but that shouldn't be more than 10% of the paper. There's enough questions to hit >90%.In short  that's how to score for Physics  especially at O level.,btohqsg
plan ur sem properly make sure u make full use of ur time take note of all the due dates and rlly make sure u look at the rubric when doing ur assignments,btohqsg
i in sem 2 tp sci,btohqsg
tryna hit that 4.0 but even i struggling quite abit,btohqsg
his sem 1 gpa is 1.4 he in chem eng but his math and chem was very bad he just pass,btohqsg
The secret is out.Now I'll expect copycats of my book 😂,btohqsg
ok do I look like ik Korean,btohqsg
Full of K idols in ur dp I suppose,btohqsg
Where do u learn ur Korean from?,btohqsg
아  한국어 학원에서 배웠고 지금 한국친구한테서 배우고 있어요,btohqsg
I used to learn from like tuition centre (PM if you wanna know),btohqsg
But I quit and learn myself now since I got Korean friends to just check if I’m on the right track,btohqsg
Practicing with native speaker is always better,btohqsg
Yeah all my friends are native,btohqsg
i pray that the igp for my course drops like comp sci 😁😁,btohqsg
it dropped from 3.9 to 3.7 havent u heard,btohqsg
but i think nus also drop a bit,btohqsg
i think used to be 3.9+ become 3.84 also,btohqsg
but ntu def dropped by 0.2,btohqsg
Maybe nxt time they will reform ag,btohqsg
worst case i jst sign on teehee,btohqsg
Can sign on as clerk meh,btohqsg
can ur friend be my friend,btohqsg
ask me again after my POP,btohqsg

Thanks for telling me I’m a bitch,btohqsg
happy cny hope u old fucks still get angbao 🥰🥰🥰😜😜😜,btohqsg
isok I need wait for may bruh,btohqsg
cny i can get a few angpao,btohqsg
i can get angpao on two occasions,btohqsg
i feel mildly offended you called me a guy  but thank you,btohqsg
and then get offended five more times 🙈,btohqsg
is it cos i circle the o also,btohqsg
If you put one wrong one everything will be wrong,btohqsg
they say 2 mark for each name correct 1 for both of the thing u circle,btohqsg
Hmm you waste mark like that,btohqsg
my paper got so many mistake in marking tho,btohqsg
total 50 marks they gave me 30.5 marks,btohqsg
okay so like rn i rlly dont rmb anything taught last year during physics what do i do now :(,btohqsg
like how its obvious ur going to enlist?,btohqsg
follow what I did. I can tell you half my students score As and the other half B3s following this. Many of them started with near fails at end of S3.Almost no one scores below B3  except for those with learning problems like dyslexia or dyscalculia or something to that effect.,btohqsg
So you really only need to keep doing tys  then do prelim papers and focus on explanation questions,btohqsg
Now it's the start of the year. You still have time.Last year I had a student came  do badly for S3  but not failed yet. Didn't start lesson as timings don't match due to CCA.By mid years  it was really bad already. I assessed him again and he actually scored only 20% for pure physics 2021 O lvl paper which was a relatively easy paper.First student I ever recommend to drop to combined science. Even with the poor background  by O lvl last year  he went to a B3 for combined. He only started lessons in July. Happy that he woke up in time.But you still have plenty of time  so scoring at least a B3 or higher by your own is entirely possible.,btohqsg
So if can't remember anything  for now  just do tys  do wb and read textbook. Start slow. Every achievement started from a baby step  but you need to take that first step,btohqsg
14 more days to 5 feb,btohqsg
i just scared cuz the ticket say no filming or pics idk if people will be walking to check,btohqsg
Nobody care abt that rule tbh,btohqsg
u can use ur phone to film,btohqsg
(yes  other than hyperplay  ive only been to 1 other concert so i have no bloody clue),btohqsg
All the no filming concerts I’ve been too . Everyone took footages with their phones,btohqsg
Oh ok not sure if they are strict about taking videos there but wow when i went for gidle in star theatre the security there was so anal,btohqsg
No. They say no filming as in with video cam or cam,btohqsg
For my case it was with phone too,btohqsg
Some people were dragged out to delete their video footage,btohqsg
They literally see your phone in the air?,btohqsg
Even the ones that are seated in the middle  the security guards have no issues blocking people's view to cross to the middle to warn people not to video,btohqsg
Yeah tell me about it  hopefully indoor stadium's security not gonna be this anal,btohqsg
i inside alr still want show me ads 💀holiday spf also doesn't leave me alone,btohqsg
How do i save these messages...,btohqsg
my relative who is a regular gave me angpao and of course...got SPF logo at the back💀give me a break bruh,btohqsg
O i forwarded to a channel w onky me,btohqsg
cny 2 days I'm stuck at changi air base,btohqsg
Is normal   last time during my army days also need to standby for guard duty for whatever celebrations one  just press on bro,btohqsg
aiyoh do tys onlydon't need save. Nothing special. Just whack the topical first.,btohqsg

lol one of them have  but its not stress related,btohqsg
"oh fun fact  if you know a person is angry  dont fuckin tell them ""stop being so sensitive"" when you know they are being radio silent while theyre talking to you",btohqsg
trust me my rage is bad,btohqsg
Wtf the alcohol dealers nicer than cai png uncles,btohqsg

Why most of the Chinese students in Singapore are shit at their own language?,btohqsg
Like I have seen my friend getting 7/20 or 5/20 for Chinese essay🥴. I know that it doesn’t suits for everyone  but even in my own language which is Tamil  students won’t be bad as they are and only some fail.,btohqsg
Is it because Chinese language has many characters or is it because of its grammar?,btohqsg
In summary  what makes Chinese language the hardest?,btohqsg
Tbh Chinese should know Chinese  if not its like giving up on your own culture,btohqsg
"I don't like those Chinese who keep telling me ""can u speak English""",btohqsg
Feel like giving them a slap,btohqsg
My Chinese friend can't even speak a sentence without adding 3 or 4 words from English,btohqsg
But native speakers are the ones who scores A1 in chinese,btohqsg
Tbh  no matter how much i've talked in English  it wouldn't match the feeling of speaking in my mothertounge language,btohqsg
I find it to be much more easier to communicate.,btohqsg
As usual. It's a zoo at home,btohqsg
11 book ins 11 book outs to POP,btohqsg
nah i have up on Chinese,btohqsg
every book in an NSF is 1% closer to ORD,btohqsg
unpopular opinion : two years really very fast,btohqsg
"its fast only if you don't focus on the ""i want to die"" part and actually pause your life bcos of ns",btohqsg
faster once we in unit...unless suay,btohqsg
tfw you escape mono infantry and end up in guards,btohqsg
If u heng heng siam mono n anything with combat/ combat support,btohqsg
that combat fit guy who got kent ridge asa must be damn shiok now,btohqsg
at least you'll use up most of your bad luck that way,btohqsg
My friend escape mono by going scs  pro term infantry den posted to tekong spec,btohqsg
I think the better combat unit would be opfor sia,btohqsg
Kena close contact den stay in hotel 14 days,btohqsg
Hear armour one quite fk up,btohqsg

omg i js realised how difficult it is to write an english essay 🙏,btohqsg
personal recounts are the hardest essay type to write imo,btohqsg
best is to write composition essays,btohqsg
PEEL is a bit ass imo,btohqsg
then im like: what i do.,btohqsg
try this:PointExplanation of pointExample supporting explanationElaboration on exampleCounterargumentRebuttal of counterargumentLink back to main point,btohqsg
P3ECRL method for destroying your wrists during english paper 1,btohqsg
whats the diff between counter and rebutt,btohqsg
counterargument is basically an argument against your pointrebuttal of counterargument is arguing against the argument arguing against your point,btohqsg
e.g.if you agree that NS is a waste of time  a counterargument would be that NS allows you to learn social skills and grow as a personthe rebuttal would be that you could do all that w/o NS  with the example of singaporean women being raised,btohqsg
brother that one is a 5/10 C6 level example,btohqsg
How to ck and not be hated by ur peers,btohqsg
im aiming for an a2 for english,btohqsg
I would say that is something all kengsters need to know,btohqsg
train wrists  read more  and use the method i outlined for el paper 1,btohqsg
imo just read a lot of sample essays and see what points they use haha then try explaining their points in your own words,btohqsg
The parts which you can score you must get full marks like certain repeated qns in O level compre.,btohqsg
then your essay needs proper planning,btohqsg
or you can easily mess up if you go on autopilot,btohqsg
reading model essays will give you an ideas on how to write but doing many essays and getting them marked will give you the fastest improvements,btohqsg
none of those fly in BMT/POBC,btohqsg
how was ur bmt exp ah,btohqsg
what happened in the first bmt,btohqsg
