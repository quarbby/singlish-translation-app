Today is Friday again and that means $3 cashback from DBS Paylah Hawker promo!üëâ DBS Paylah $5 code CHRHAF684I got Roast Chicken Rice today.In Singapore  people couldn't agree on whether roast chicken rice or poached chicken rice was better. Some loved the crispy and flavorful roast chicken with its golden skin  while others preferred the tender and subtle taste of poached chicken. However  wise food lovers realized that both dishes had their own special qualities  and Singapore embraced the idea that both could coexist and be enjoyed by different people with different tastes. So  are you a roast chicken or poached chicken person?Cost of meal: $3.50Cost of drink: $1.00DBS Cashback: ($3.00)Net cost for lunch: $1.50üëâ Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgüëâ More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg

I bought apple products from their online store  using my Citi Rewards Mastercard. However no bonus 10x points were credited.Other purchases made on the apple online store but paid using my amaze card (which is paired to the citi rewards Mastercard) were credited 10x bonus points. Any reason for the difference? Any help is appreciated!!,btohqsg
can ask them for refund?like kana cheat,btohqsg
Monthly transfer in $15k  then withdraw immediately can? (Meaning less than 200k in the account),btohqsg
I think this is more on citi‚Äôs end. They have been very confusing I must say. It‚Äôs weird that the Citi person listed out  some of my apple transactions have 10x points  and some that don‚Äôt. Then I went to look into it and realised only the amaze ones have 10x. All have been done on the online store. Waiting on their reply still. Hope I‚Äôll have a resolution. So much headache ü•π thanks all for the help. Really appreciate it.,btohqsg

Hello all  may I ask. Im gonna pay for a cruise soon. I'm accruing Kris miles  would the instarem + Citi rewards be the best option still?,btohqsg
Nope. Citi doesn't cover travel mccs. So cruise is not eligible for rewards,btohqsg
Oh thanks Andrew  then would be the next best option for miles,btohqsg
Hsbc revol for 4mpd. But I would probs use cimb visa signature for 10%,btohqsg
ooh. how about the amex kris?,btohqsg

Ahhh. Worth for the first time bonus miles ?,btohqsg
Dear gru can I check can I use Maybank visa platinum to pay for utilities,btohqsg
Dun seem to exclude on the tnc but just to be confirm thanks,btohqsg
hi all do i earn 4mpd for concert tickets using amaze + citi rewards ?,btohqsg
If you buy online  Citi rewards card itself can earn 10x points per dollar (4mpd). Tried on ticketmaster,btohqsg
Yes if contribute to sign up bonus then it's worth it imo,btohqsg
Ah ok sounds good. Will consider.Actually sometimes I'm a bit confused. Pardon for the following noob question. If I were to use Instarem+Citi Rewards. Won't this always be considered as an online purchase and qualify for 10x bonus (cap at 10K)? So means I can always use Instarem even for cruises/ utilities/ taxes?,btohqsg
How to convert ah? Just call in?,btohqsg
Hello  anyone know if it is worth transfer krispay miles to kris flyer?,btohqsg
Nope there's exclusion list. Can refer to it online. Travel and all the usual like insurance etc are not eligible for 10x,btohqsg
if you're a miles person  of course worth it...,btohqsg
if you're a cashback user  stack and claim for NTUC vouchers only when got milesback promo,btohqsg
Hi. Taking into account the reduction in hsbc EGA interest. Is it still better compare to uob account with savings below 100k?,btohqsg
Ah makes sense. But will still get the base points?,btohqsg
R any of you looking to buy stocks in USA mkt? What stock ticker will u be looking at or had just bought?,btohqsg
No. Amaze changes the type of spend to online. But it doesn't change the MCC of the spend.,btohqsg
Oh it's different categories. I get it now. Thanks man,btohqsg
Yes... So travel spend  even if it's online still won't earn you 10x doe citi rewards because those are specifically excluded.,btohqsg
EIR is 5% right? And if only 500  its only .65%,btohqsg
Base point is 0.4mpd. Don't do that. It's a waste.,btohqsg
Hi all  just want to confirm if i understand hsbc revol t&c correctly.There is a monthly cap of 9000 bonus points. So only the first $1000 spend is eligible for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Ahh okies. Does it have expiring if i convert it to kris flyer?,btohqsg
All KrisFlyer miles expire 3 years once credited into your KrisFlyer account (Also note that you can only transfer miles from Krispay to Krisflyer within 7 days after the transaction was made),btohqsg
Mcc issue  change to online wont change the fact that certain mcc is excluded,btohqsg
Yes  thanks for explaining. Very helpful,btohqsg
Has anyone ever done a FX Transfer using Instarem? Do you get points on it? If so  how many  and is there a cap?Couldn‚Äôt find this info on their website anywhere‚Ä¶,btohqsg

Ya how much u want to change?,btohqsg
I usually change only $100 sgd when i go JB a day,btohqsg
Save the trouble thinking. If not doing big amt. Not much diff.,btohqsg
Lol $1 does not worth the effort lah. Time is more valuable,btohqsg
I will go 1-2 days a month only. Ya i also think maybe not worth the effort,btohqsg
Hi recently i watched a video by the fift person on Sheng Siong. Then 1 guy shared he bought Sheng Shiong 10 years ago then the divide yield on is 18%. I thinking to find a good dividend stock to keep long term. Any recommendations of video  people  which stocks or website i can get information or tips?,btohqsg
Hi bro n sis May I check if I am combining Citi reward card + amaze in StarHub buying a new phone.Will I get the bonus point ?,btohqsg
My comment is to have this stock  you need to look for a stock that will continue to have business growth and the dividend payout will increase over the year. The 18% is calculated based on last 1-2 years. During the initial first few years  the dividend payout of Sheng Siong is about only 4-5.5% per year. It is because share price increase n dividend payout increase  that resulted the 18 percent annual return for last 2 years after he hold it for 10 years as his initial investment is at lower price compare to today price.If you are interested on this method  you can follow Warren Buffet method - Value investing.,btohqsg
Yes  but only the 1st 1k of eligible transactions in ur statement mth is eligible for bonus,btohqsg
I see.. ok thanks. Cos this Citi reward mcc quite blur de‚Ä¶ mcc code dun have transport de. But use grab still 10x üòÖ,btohqsg
I have hsbc premier card  which gives 5%cashback and 1mpd. Been reading all your posts on hsbc revolution which gives 4mpd  but only for online and contactless. Should I apply for the revo card instead?,btohqsg
hsbc premier should be 5%+ 1x point i.e. 0.4mpd  only for limited categories. Hsbc revolution covers much more categories.,btohqsg
transaction type indicator for each transaction.,btohqsg
online transaction goes by blacklist not whitelist MCC,btohqsg
But how do we maintain the TRB for HSBC Premier while playing the merry go round game?,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone knows if citi rewards would earn 4mpd for the 1st $1k if I were to add my amaze card into my google wallet and pay with it?From what I understand  any payment through google wallet for citi rewards won't qualify for the 4mpd.,btohqsg

I recently managed to update IRAS giro  and also credit card giro payment. quite smooth.,btohqsg
I am going to go back to the branch and haul the branch mgr ask him/her fill in the form to 100% approval criteria,btohqsg
u send a copy of the empty form here I teach you which field input what,btohqsg
Is your signature on both banks same? If it is different  no way you can setup giro unless you update your signature on both banks to the same one.,btohqsg
u share a copy of your form. I tell you which field is for what.,btohqsg
Nope and that is also not rejection reason,btohqsg
signature is the most difficult. the rest of the rejection is your imput error liao,btohqsg
you just share the form bah. I tell you which part fill in what.,btohqsg
Not me the bank officer filled in for me,btohqsg
ü§îHope u mean good. But not look at his cc numberüòÇ.,btohqsg

Since it is free to resubmit I can do 100 different variation until the IRAS or bank call me up to fuck me,btohqsg

you need to tick the box for income tax and property tax and fill in your property tax number. and tick the up to 12 months interest fee for both property and income tax row,btohqsg
What does the property tax number look like? I know income tax is nric,btohqsg
Strange. I've been trying to add a few times and it always failed  the last time was as recent as this morning. Then after seeing your response I went and tried adding Amaze to GPay again and this time it succeeded.. Lol,btohqsg
not sure whether everyone the same. better log in to iras website to see.,btohqsg
this part fill in everything including your fullNRIC,btohqsg
bank account number make sure is the EGA account number and not HSBC credit/debit card number.,btohqsg

btw for ios user  what card is better for xnap pay? since amaze card can't be added to apple wallet,btohqsg
I m a user of it..I chose it over other miles card is because it recognize up to 0.17 spending  coz their formula to the points calcution is roundup($ x 3) = ptsSo 0.17 x 3 = 0.51 round up as $1 means 3 ptsThen 25 000pts = 10k milesSo I can sorta recognize those .90 purchases whereas alot of banks r $5 block  means 4.90 no miles/pts awarded or 9.90 only $5 recognizedThe other bank u can consider is citibank miles card as they recognized round down but $1 blockOr hsbc revo also $1 block,btohqsg
Ooo which promo code is this?,btohqsg
hsbc revo 9x point no $1 block,btohqsg
does hsbc revolution card earn bonus points as long as it is online payment or Google pay regardless of merchant type?,btohqsg
No. Bonus points on the whitelisted mccs via contactless or online payment,btohqsg
Read this. Especially item 4 5 6 and 7.https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/credit-cards/revolution/offers/10x-reward-points-terms-and-conditions.pdf,btohqsg
Is UOB Preferred Platinum Visa good or no? It seems to earn 4mpd on almost all transactions via mobile contactless  but I don't see people recommending it in this community,btohqsg

If you spend $4.99  how many miles you will get?,btohqsg
Zero  it's per 5 dollars block,btohqsg
If my UOB EVOL approve at the start of this month and the statement is on 15th. Does that means my spending so far does not have cash back,btohqsg
Call in to ask to change date,btohqsg
Usually firsts months hard to Match,btohqsg

The first statement of each quarter,btohqsg
Just found this. UOB values your miles at $0.005 per mile that is a horrible rate. If you used it to redeem economy class ticket  I believe you can easily get $0.015 per mile.,btohqsg
Hi  new to this miles thing. May I know if it is worth using 25 000 ocbc$ to redeem 10 000 krisflyer miles. Need to pay $25 to redeem. Saw some of my ocbc$ exiring in aug  so wondering if it is worthwhile doing that. Thanks.,btohqsg
Uob app then click acct and click ur credit card to view ur statement  its reflected there,btohqsg
are u using miles to redeem flight? If so need to redeem miles anyway,btohqsg
Hi  for citi rewards  anyway to check if i have hit the 9k bonus points for the month?,btohqsg
Actually the earliest that I intend to travel might be around end this year. I have miles from citi premier miles too. So maybe this one can also redeem for cash vouchers since it is the ocbc titanium card.,btohqsg
Need to see how much points your are changing. Otherwise redeem as vouchers might be another option.,btohqsg
can add up the bonus points from citi rewards websitecitirewards.com/welcome.htm,btohqsg
Is your miles in citi premier enough to redeem ticket? Perhaps can combine both in Kris account since miles in premier does not expire. So you can keep the rest in premier till u need it in the future. Miles convert  to Kris account will have another 3 years of expiry date.,btohqsg
Can also check your credit card statement  last page to see points earned for the month,btohqsg
Thanks. It is only sufficient for 1 ticket. But if I am travelling with my friend  then miles not enough. Let's say if I am helping my friend to book her ticket  and I buy two tickets together  the other ticket can pay cash or partially offset with my miles?,btohqsg
Hi guys  any recommendation for credit cards preferably without minimum spend and used solely for petrol usage?,btohqsg
That's true. Have to do the calculations.,btohqsg
If you are traveling with friends  then you need to check if the ticket for redemption is still available. Depends on the destination  most of the time the tickets are fully redeemed many months before departure date n only left ticket for purchase. You need to book very much earlier.About partial cash  I have no answer on this.,btohqsg
Ok I see  thanks. Very much earlier meaning at least 6 to 9 months ahead?,btohqsg
My thoughts on redeeming miles. Not worth to mix cash and miles to get a ticket  does not give you optimal value. Better off either buying the ticket entirely in cash (charge to your miles card) or redeeming all the tickets in miles  but this should be done a few months in advance and chances of getting redemptions to popular destinations during peak travel periods is hard,btohqsg
Depends on destination. You need to login to SIA website to check. If more people book  the tickets may fully redeemed any time.,btohqsg
The earliest SQ allows redemption is 355 days in advance :)) for me I choose to travel off peak periods and to less popular destinations in the region  so 4-5 months in advance is ok  if your dates are flexi,btohqsg
Any hsbc premier account holders can advice on how you avoid the TRB requirements? Or do you just pay the service fee? Breakeven seems to be at around $300k deposits.,btohqsg
I heard some use the $15K per month deposit for the premier requirements,btohqsg
Thanks. That's helpful üòä I will need to do some planning.,btohqsg
Indeed  some planning is needed when redeeming miles  due to various airlines having different redemption quota per cabin per flight. But first need to convert your credit card points into miles  ready them points on standby when you need them to book. Once you see a good date just go for it  Mai tu liao üòÅüëç,btohqsg
Haha yes indeed wise words! üëçThanks Jon!,btohqsg
Hello!! Lazada department stores  is this referring to LazMall?,btohqsg
If miles only enough for 1 person  then login to SIA n check is the ticket on date of travel still available for redemption. If yes  get your friend to login n standby to buy too.Once you click n redeem successfully  your friend can then click to purchase.Is this method feasible? üòÇ,btohqsg
If use Smart scb card use on other things like NTUC will get any point?,btohqsg
No bonuses but got some point?,btohqsg
Is it check under redeem miles? Haha  seems like a joint ops with friend. Good idea  I will try it üòä thanks for suggesting.,btohqsg
1.6 pt per dollar or about 0.5% per dollar,btohqsg
Yes. Need to login to your Kris account then you can search the flight with ticket that is redeemable.,btohqsg
I'm in Seoul and everywhere  including hotel  they ask me to insert card. Which is best card to use other than the lady's card for shopping and dining ? Is it only general spending card ?,btohqsg

Lol guys i know im a noob but how do i transfer krispay miles to krisflyer account?,btohqsg
transaction history. only can transfer krispay miles earned from transactions in the last 7 days or redeemed from bank points,btohqsg
Is tapping safer than inserting card for beating the skimmer?,btohqsg
I think inserting higher risk because can lead to higher limits. If contactless  lower risk cos lower limits.,btohqsg
Hi for UOB evol credit card  I know max spend for 8% cashback for online and mobile contactless is $250 each.However to get the cashback  need to spend min$600  so for this  can I just spend like $350 on online  $250 on mobile contactless?I know the online only $250 spend will have 8% cashback.,btohqsg

Ok  will take a look at that card. Thanks for your recommendation,btohqsg

Hi  I'm planning to making booking of a Japanese hotel via their website. I tested the DBS trick to find its MCC and it turns out to be Retail instead of Travel. So this means my original plan to use Amaze + UOB Lady's card won't work.I'm thinking of using Amaze wallet since there's a 4% rebate and FX from wallet is much better than using Amaze with card. Question is  is there a cap of spending for 4% rebate?Also  can I deposit SGD in the wallet and Instarem will simply draw down in SGD and convert at the point of transaction  which is what YouTrip can do?,btohqsg
Up to 125 spend per transaction for amaze wallet promo,btohqsg
Ah  thanks. Then no point since the amount is greater than 125.,btohqsg
How about CRMC + Amaze since it is retail?,btohqsg
Was thinking of using that. However  CMRC has a cap of $1k and the hotel booking exceeds this by quite a lot (over 3k). So may not be cost effective after factoring Instarem FX rate,btohqsg
Hi can check if I want to change Iras giro arrangement to hsbc  do I have to cancel my existing bank arrangements or just submit the manual master form to change will do?,btohqsg
"YES YOU HIT THE PROBLEM I HIT..Japan hotels many funny MCCs.. mine was ""direct marketing"" mcc.End up I used Amaze + Manhattan.",btohqsg
Subsequently I gave it some thought  and if you know for sure that the MCC is not travel related  actually you can use Amaze + CRMC for up to $1k spend on the 'fake' hotel booking.But for your case (above $3k and yet MCC is not travel)  the perfect combi in my opinion is Amaze + Manhattan.Another suggestion is you can try looking for that same hotel at Expedia Trip.cometc.. and use UOB Lady to book directly.,btohqsg
Since it is retail(fake) mcc although it is hotel  have you explore OCBC titanium rewards?,btohqsg
What is dbs trick? Can share,btohqsg
Do take note tt 4% is not instant off... it is a cumulative to the points system n u need 2000 pts = $500 sgd spending to get tt $20 credit into wallet,btohqsg
Oh interesting‚Ä¶.. i did not know that  but if book through OTA sure classified as travel right,btohqsg
Direct Marketing - Catalog Merchant  right? Haha,btohqsg
Yes. I suspect if the hotel use the payment processor then will kenna. Trikota or what,btohqsg
Thanks for suggestion. Too late for me to apply other credit cards. I'll use Trust card. Maybe I'll check UOB Krisflyer card if there is any benefits,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt assume all.But the major ones like Expediatrip.com(listed on milelion) should be safe la,btohqsg
Sounds like using OTA will be safer a bit albeit the FCY charges ü§£ü§£,btohqsg

"hello  anyone uses the uob lady's card  and purchase air ticket on starlux? Is it counted under ""travel""?",btohqsg

btw  buying via online ticketing like trip   vs airlines like SQ / starlux. got difference?,btohqsg
like are the ticket any different?,btohqsg
If u book direct with airline  any issue u laise to them direct. Thru site  u going thru broker so the message goes thru one more party. Just like travel agency. But travel agency do get better pricing at time due to agreement with airline,btohqsg
yeah i realised. agency like cheaper,btohqsg
Travel agency have special reserve seats from airline due to the volume they agreed to sell for airline and package with their tour,btohqsg
Just to share  i once have a cancel flight in tokyo due to weather  the airline hotline csnt be go through  but as the airticket is bought thru chan bro  they settle the flight change for us to fly back next day. Travel agency got dedicate hotline to airline themselves,btohqsg

work till no hands and or leg haha,btohqsg
I thought OA to SA is one way ticket? U can‚Äôt use SA to buy flat  right?,btohqsg
One way ticket henceeither i sacrifice the 1.5% compound annually just so have enough OA funds to pay for hdb downpayment (miss the amount long term but can have tax relief long run)or just whack OA into SA and use cash on hand to pay (this will lower the RSTU i think ),btohqsg
if you are good in investment  you cash in hand can generate return higher than higher 5% per year. Then use OA to down payment is better.,btohqsg
MoneyOwl shows 15% time weighted return   outperform cpfoa few times leh,btohqsg
i dont think i have good intutions as well. currently cash on hand in ocbc 360 so since less than 75k  get 3.65%pa,btohqsg
but it depends on the timing as well. if put into when its at its lowest then definitely weighted return is very high,btohqsg
Just some comments  i think perhaps you should mention a few more times in your video that you should aim to invest for the long term when you invest in a 100% equities portfolio  i only heard you mention this at the very end of the video.It‚Äôs a bit sad because people may be deterred from investing in equities in fear that they may have sub optimal returns because of your very short term results of 2 years.,btohqsg

do i get it on the month I open or the following month?,btohqsg

1 July is a Saturday. Might mess out some of my computations if money transferred in are not immediately counted in for monthly average balance. Need to be careful. Reminder to all too that planning to move money around on 1 July too.,btohqsg

usually after 6am is fine. Unless is those scheduled maintenance where bank already tell you they finish at 9am.,btohqsg
Why need around 12am? I thought can do it anytime within the day? Or at least before 12pm?,btohqsg
sat might be considered not working day or half working day. so amount transferred in might not be counted towards the average monthly balance until next working day.,btohqsg
yah I guess before 12pm safer. think maybe do at 9.30am.,btohqsg

is it worth to pair the HSBC travelone card with instarem amaze?,btohqsg
Depends on your use case? I pair it with Amaze as I intend to cash out all my miles on year end. Else.. better to pair with other cards if looking at general spend due to no expiry nature,btohqsg
Use HSBC Revolution for it  can earn 4mpd. Not sure about Citi PM tho,btohqsg
hmm but if you‚Äôre overseas  assuming you only have the travel one to use  would it be better to use instarem amaze (since it‚Äôs denominated in SGD  so 1.2mpd)  or use the card directly and pay the conversion fees (for 2.4mpd)?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if this fee is imposed on $ transferred out to grabpay/revolut? Primarily using 2000 instapoints to exchange for $20 and to transfer it out,btohqsg

Please note that Revo don‚Äôt earn 10x for public transportation,btohqsg
Himay I ask is hsbc cc application always take a long time to process,btohqsg
they sometimes like to approve but dont tell you until 2 weeks later  can check the hsbc app to see if they issued you a virtual cc,btohqsg
Dur if straight up try and upsell then its kinda illegal (financial advise). All will say do your own risk reward analysis.AKA Do your own research.Almost every REIT is a good buy but relative to what price you buy at.,btohqsg
I apply as a new customer,btohqsg
you can log in still  just create an account,btohqsg
also you need to consider what kind of REITS suits you.mainly Commercial  Hospitality  Logistics.some are higher risk swings some are defensive plays.a common good indicator is the P/B ratio but this does not take into account the future prospects and debt ratio of the trust.,btohqsg
Thank you so much for your advise. I faced quite some people advise against buy REITS. But i felt i want to have a diversified portfolio. I want some shares  REITS  S&P  T bills  MMF.,btohqsg
"only 2 reasons i can think why they are against REITS  they are stock investors can get high return (ya but at higher risk)Financial ""guru"" telling you to get investment linked plans instead.But ultimately REITS are between bonds - equity risk wise. some what similar to buying property with consistent dividend and some minor upside in price appreciation.Of course they are not for everyone as they are more ""boring"" and dividends may not be reinvested (may have to do it yourself)",btohqsg
What OCBC/DBS credit card would your recommend for lower spenders,btohqsg
I would argue everyone should be the CEO of their life and start learning how to market and sell themselves. If you are reputable enough you can build your personal brand and don't have to depend on a reputable company for branding purposes. But start building transferable skills and more side hustles,btohqsg
Not financial advice but stay clear of ILPs most are front loaded and you are basically paying agent commission for the first few years/months,btohqsg
Reit has same factor exposure of small cap value + bonds  but with additional idiosyncratic sectoral risk. In layman term  reits does not provide additional diversification benefits that stocks and bonds alr gives. In fact. Adding reits may lower risk adjusted return.,btohqsg
Thank you for your input. Is lower risk adjusted return a good thing? üòÖ too chiem for me,btohqsg

I assume you are referring to your annual premium for AIA is due soon. Citi PayAll charge fees. It is like pay a fees to buy miles.Not sure how much is your annual premium. May be you wanna share.

Hi all quick question  is Instarem+Citi Rewards better vs. Wise Card for payments overseas? As I don‚Äôt know each card‚Äôs FX spread,btohqsg
Wise Card for o/s spend has better exchange rate than Instarem. But Wise Card does not award customers for spending on its (apple green) debit card. Also  you need to consider in totality the benefits vs your administrative effort (man hours taken to apply  wait for card to come  activate card  monitor  pay bills  file e-statement  etc).,btohqsg
For me  I use my OCBC 90n and Cardup to pay my AIA annual premium which is about the same amount. I am a new user so the CardUp fees is 1.5%.https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/cards/90-degrees-travel-credit-card#popup-cardup,btohqsg
You still can use XNAP app. Far more superior. Else just skip store that only allow paynow or cash payment terms.,btohqsg
Thanks! Some shops such as those that sells Lights and Bathroom equipments other than cash  NETS and PayNow only accept GrabPay or FavePay.,btohqsg
Isn't favepay better than xnap. You get cashback with fave plus the card rewards. For xnap u only get card rewards,btohqsg
Agree. I stacked Live Fresh rebates and FavePay rewards (I curate a strategy). Now the strategy is torn apart by this DBS nerf.,btohqsg

Amaze card converts overseas spend to local online spend. No overseas bonus points/cashback on the linked card.

Of course. That is calendar quarter  it is not the 'statement quarter' that UOB uses. For your case  pretty sure June is your first month and your quarter should be June-July-Aug. But you should call in and verify with CSO when is your quarter's start date..,btohqsg
Omg that‚Äôs so messy. I need to call again. Thanks for saving me. üò≠,btohqsg

You can request to change your which date ur statement month ends at. But don't think can change quarter.

So I just called Uob customer support. This wonderful guy called Seran answered and patiently Clarified all my doubtsUob one credit card1) the quarter is fixed to the month  the card is approved by Uob. Like someone else mentioned   the expiry date on the card is good reference point. My card approved on june2023.likehow trazora korkor verified   my first quarter is june23 july23 and aug23.2) there is no way (1) can be amended/modified. Uob has no system to adjust the statement quarter. So pls don‚Äôt waste time on this. Though  The billing cycle can be adjusted as per customer preference. So I have called in changed my billing cycle/statement to be on 30th of every month.3)anyone who signed up for the Uob one card can still get the promotional ‚Äòbonus additional cashback‚Äô for the next two quarters.

Hello all! Hoping for all of your expertise in this matter  I'm currently in Bali using Amaze + Citi  and I don't quite understand how Instarem Point earnings are calculated. I understand that it's 1sgd equiv = 1 point  but is there a minimum transaction amount required to qualify or something?,btohqsg
Yes sgd10 minimum to qualify for points,btohqsg
Thanks@ChrisHMSGfor sharing at the event. It‚Äôs a great talk!,btohqsg
You need 4.8% of return to get $1k every month. So far only UOB one with $500 expenses + self transfers salary or 3 Giro can have 5%. The rest need to take a bit of risks.The other way is to place it in UOB USD FD (6 or 12 months) which currently give 5%++ of interest but with currency risks.Assuming the interest rate does not change  you shall get $1k of interest every month.Other have any comments on above?,btohqsg
How to self transfer salary to uob one?,btohqsg

This worked today. So need to inform cashier that using Uob card.Wonder can still double dip with the standard Uob one cashback and bonus cashback,btohqsg
I don't see how LLM can help with trading. Computer algo has been used in trading since the late 80s. It is called quantitative analysis and the most profitable trading model to date,btohqsg
think that is the up to 10% cashback part,btohqsg
u mean 7/11 cashier gave you $1.20 additional off?,btohqsg
Yeah it should work separately and stack..so you spend $12 using UOB One at 7/11..cashier charges you $10.80 ($1.20 discount).. and the $10.80 earns 10% cashback from UOB One cashback program.,btohqsg
Sorry  did not follow through.  Last I knew was that MCC produced by XNAP was erratic and not consistent.  What's the latest for this issue?  Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Hello Gurus  UOB One the ADB for bonus interest is calculated only for the first 100K or for the total balance in the account.Ex : 105K for 15 days and 80K for 15 days 2775K / 30 = 92.5K or only 100K is considered for first 15 days and 80K for next 15 days which gives 90K ADB,btohqsg

you need to sum up the daily ending balance for each day of the month  divide by the number of days in the month.,btohqsg
this should be the same formula for all other banks too for computation of monthly average daily balance.,btohqsg
Ah alright thanks. If its $0 will the fall below fee still be deducted into negative territory?,btohqsg

For the UOB 1 account  I‚Äôve to spend min $500 + credit salary of min 1.6K to earn the 3.85% interest  if I receive my debit card on 19 June and credit card today  will the spending period still be as per calendar month (1st to last day of the month)? Means by end of this month  even though it‚Äôs less than 2 weeks to spend.I went down to UOB branch  was asked to try the chatbot/call the customer service (CS). I tried all methods  chatbot with live agent cannot answer specific questions  called the CS  waited for 20mins  said have to transfer me to the rewards department  waited for another 20mins  rewards department only answers credit card questions. Rewards department wanted to transfer me to the debit card department but I don‚Äôt wanna wait anymore. ü•≤,btohqsg

For UOB one -- do note that the salary crediting has to take place before month end too. one of my months  my salary was transferred slightly later  hit past the month into next. and it was deemed that i didn't clear the criteria.,btohqsg
of course  because uob wont know if its salary meant for which month. they will only follow value date of the credit,btohqsg
if closing to the end of month and still see no salary crediting  faster use fast transfer and indicate as salary to still get the bonus interest,btohqsg
is there any way to exchange usd from DBS to Revolut/Wise?,btohqsg

Hello gurus! I have a question about property loan. If I plan to buy a KL property  should I finance it using Malaysian bank loan or Singapore bank loan to finance the M'sian property? Thanks for the advice in advance!,btohqsg
Anyway  just tested. You can update your credit card billing cycle via UOB chat (w live agent) so you don‚Äôt have to wait on the call just to update the changes. ü§ì,btohqsg
Malaysia Ringgit loan. I saw an article that found shld you have loaned in SGD to buy malaysia property in around 2005 till now  you would have lost close to 30% from FX alone.I Don't see MYR going back to $2:1 against SGD anytime soon.,btohqsg
not to mention if you bought the wrong malaysian property  the value would also have dropped or remained stagnant.,btohqsg

Hi guys  i have forex IG account then i was charges $25 for inactivity fee for 5 years. It is about $1500. I called in to IG for waiver but was rejected. May i know is there any other way i can get back this amount?,btohqsg
Can I ask for the Instarem/citi strategy  after max out 1k spend for 4mpd  what do they offer thereafter?,btohqsg
can be paired with other cards like citiPM for general spending (and the 1% cashback in amaze)  or OCBC TR perhaps. depends on your level of overseas spending,btohqsg
Hi all  need advice if it‚Äôs better to buy CSPX on LSE or Euronext and why?,btohqsg
They didn‚Äôt email or sms you about inactivity ?,btohqsg
How they charge u the $1500?,btohqsg
They charge $25 for 8 years,btohqsg
Monthly charges. Actually is more than $2k,btohqsg
No I meant how they deducted the amount from u? U held cash there for 5 years?,btohqsg
But why would U keep cash with ig if your account is inactive? And U don‚Äôt keep track of your cash balance?Honestly once deducted I think chances of U getting back are very Low especially if the fee is as per fee schedule made known to u.,btohqsg
I thought just park my money there like phillips capital,btohqsg
I know IBKR used to charge $10 per month inactivity fee and that was fair and square. (Now removed).Ig $25 is a bit high but sadly they put it officially in their tnc.Did u let ig earn your money in other ways? Can try appeal along that angle hey I did business at your xxxxx product. Can u please waive the fx inactivity.But if U totally inactive at ig except leaving cash idle there. I think hard.,btohqsg
Tks. I don't citi pm. Ocbc tr got cap?,btohqsg
yearly cap of about 12K+++ iirc.  Best you read up on it yourself to determine if it suits your spending behaviourtake note that overseas transactions of > $10SGD is eligible for the 1% amaze cashback. so if u tend to spend in small transactions  then maybe not worth with amaze's less favourable exchange rate,btohqsg
Just spend 8k on citi rewards and realise only 1k got 4mpd,btohqsg
This one u need to read tnc before u whack big,btohqsg
