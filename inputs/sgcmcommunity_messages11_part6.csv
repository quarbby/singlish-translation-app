a proper internal combustion engine is better than a hybrid. take a prius for instance  the engine used in the prius is lesser than a similar capacity one used in pure ICE.,btohqsg
the engine in Prius is low tech,btohqsg
Better as in what sense ?,btohqsg

Dun mind me asking  any major difference between Pioneer AVH-9250BT and AVH-5250BT?,btohqsg
Haha..just wanna gather some opinions and info before making the decision in getting one,btohqsg
but few understand Mazda. because it is a small brand and people think it is lesser in quality but in reality it is very high quality.,btohqsg
mazda skyactiv engine and trans are very good. also  the istop tech is good too. i use it everyday but i know many are afraid to use daily.,btohqsg
If i remember correctly 9 series allows wireless carplay/android auto. 5 series i know confirm need wired connection,btohqsg
i read somewhere mazda only come good after 2016,btohqsg
prior to that their engine is kinda noisy at high revv. not so smooth. but with their skyactiv engins improved a lot,btohqsg
You better check the online specs for 9 series. Pricing very different,btohqsg
when you buy a Mazda DRIVEthe car hard engine hard at say 6200 rpm and hear feel vibrations. totally smooth. it can be driven in a sporty manner. skyactiv engine,btohqsg
Is that the spider or brera? Hands down most chio car brand,btohqsg

anyway it is based on brera platform,btohqsg
preior to giulia  it's front wheel drive. a pity. beautiful car marred by front wheel drive,btohqsg
the frotn is too heavy. otherwise perfect,btohqsg
