so passing time on this group,btohqsg
MY PROFILE PICTURES ARE EVIDENCE BRO,btohqsg
just because you're in a RS doesn't mean you can't have time to make convo in a group chat ma,btohqsg
tbh I kinda expect some of the guys here are gays,btohqsg

but we are stuck in like 8-5 jobs and 12-8 jobs,btohqsg
if u are in raffles Ra class u watch out,btohqsg
Is the inference here to be made that you expect boyfriend duties?[25m] SBQ,btohqsg
What depression when my class is 2nd class for average RP,btohqsg
Bruh the physics class finished syllabus last year june and now they doing quantum mechanics only,btohqsg
where got relationship but no girlfriend duties or boyfriend duties,btohqsg
Hi my jc has cream coloured pants,btohqsg
So the deeper inference to make is that you are not performing girlfriend or boyfriend duties.,btohqsg
and a good reputation for the past 10 years,btohqsg
there is some level of expectation in every relationship,btohqsg
rip rep bc ny alot of tiktokkers,btohqsg
Side question does anyone know what that trumpet song they play during flag raising in SAF is called,btohqsg
Hmm I wonder how RA qm is like.No lindeblad the students won't puke blood,btohqsg
imagine climbing up the ladder for 10 years only to end up being undone by accursed ticc toccs,btohqsg
PUUUU PU PU PU PU PUUUUU DONG DONG DONG DONG,btohqsg
let the r.v relationship be X  then E(X) = ...?,btohqsg
So people mistake NY studens for HC students,btohqsg
freaking cringe but funny bc of that reason,btohqsg
My friend in the chem Ra class got 94% for chem overall in j1,btohqsg

Its a he  and he finished the a level chem syllabus in sec 3,btohqsg
Thinks why I say TJC=Trash JC,btohqsg
Sounds like a certain someone that used to frequent the discord server,btohqsg
john smith what cca were you in,btohqsg
I WAS IN YOUR CCA BRO,btohqsg
That’s almost as good as not being in it,btohqsg
I was in debate as a public speaker instead of as debater,btohqsg
Who cares about CCA in JC,btohqsg
So I felt awkward to go for debate parties,btohqsg

I have a theory that they are doing this 1 day testing thing to prove the kids will just go play outside,btohqsg
Do you know everybody in your school,btohqsg

SINGAPORE ARMED FORCES TRAINING INSTITUTE MILITARY INSTITUTE,btohqsg

I 100% think GFRIEND is an ok GG,btohqsg
Hi Mr Gfriend  nice to meet you,btohqsg
Someone told me to buy those Hawaiian shirts,btohqsg
Oh damn  why didn't I think of that!,btohqsg
Yea first thing u see in a person is their personality,btohqsg
Do you have a good personality?,btohqsg
it’s finding one that matches you,btohqsg
It depends on what belief system we have.If we believe some criminals are absolutely incorrigible  then the death penalty is legitimized and they have also forfeited their rights as human beings by committing vile crimes  so it's fine to use them for experimentation.,btohqsg
But I believe people can change  so I'm against both the death penalty and human experimentation,btohqsg
You mean the chad that everyone wants a piece of matches everyone?,btohqsg
International backlash to repute is a prevailing problem,btohqsg
International backlash sure did it's job at stopping organ harvesting in China,btohqsg
It comes naturally to some people,btohqsg
Cant stop what there is not evidence of,btohqsg
FWIW  I not sure whether SG has signed any agreements to not do this,btohqsg
it was a made up western propaganda story in the first place,btohqsg
But I think going without their consent  it could be violating human rights,btohqsg
propose that shady activities are happening and u shall vanish,btohqsg
Singapore has openly gone against UN conventions on several occasions,btohqsg
Tbh maybe some would welcome it,btohqsg
if the government strongly believes for something  they can push for it,btohqsg
Bc if it fails  they die earlier,btohqsg
There are certain UN conventions that SG rather not goes against,btohqsg
Order 1 for 1 starbucks on grabeats and hope its a delivery girl u can give to,btohqsg
It's not like SG buay song against UN conventions,btohqsg
Why did you send a blank message?,btohqsg
Nothing happened there tf u talking abt,btohqsg
hello 1 for 1 starbucks gimme pls,btohqsg
It depends how far Singapore decides to value its own personal values as a country versus the backlash that it is willing to take,btohqsg
Why are there vans outside my flat?,btohqsg
The flow fits nicely without being awkward,btohqsg
Just end it all before u are ended,btohqsg
We should remove any traces of him from our chat group,btohqsg
You do know the Singapore government has abused the Internal Security Act to indefinitely detain opposition members,btohqsg
It was in the past  but it happened.,btohqsg
Eh I think gf can help with studies,btohqsg
Why is there a kueh memepack,btohqsg
Unfortunately i do not hold strong political views currently,btohqsg
He wants to show his NS pride,btohqsg

Do strong political views hold you?,btohqsg
Not rly affected by politics rn so nah,btohqsg
