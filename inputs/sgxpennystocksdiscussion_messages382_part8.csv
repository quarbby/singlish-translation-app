@MysticDaxany thoughts on the Aspen play today?,btohqsg
I cut my 230 my 235 position. But obviously they bought back from retailers at cheap.Actually the Honeywell news is a bonus  without it  doesnâ€™t mean much.The CEO will find another MNC to place orders. This guy gets shit done .But the lack of details on the deal of how it broke down is what I donâ€™t like. Was it necessary to announce when they have not firmed up on agreement etc.,btohqsg
Earlier today Hong Lai Huat news on MOU with Chinese on largest Solar farm in Cambodia.What I can say is HLH is making itself a target by BBs with all these upcoming deals which will be interesting catalyst for the counter in time to come.Watch this one closely. This one gonna be played big when they want to.- SKOlD 1 billion agribusiness update soon?- biggest Solar farm MOU with Chinese ?Whatâ€™s next,btohqsg
