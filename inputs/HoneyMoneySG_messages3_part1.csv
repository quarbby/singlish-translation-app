Hello  does anyone use citi payall? And is it worth? To use it with a citi cash back+ card?,btohqsg
Understand there‚Äôs a small service fee  but is the cash back more than this fee?,btohqsg
I used it with Citi Premiermiles,btohqsg
2% fee vs Citi cashback+usually more worthwhile if there's ongoing promos,btohqsg
check Citi cashback+ cashback cap + tier requirementsthen work backwards,btohqsg
Ohh but 2% fee is more than the 1.6% the card gives üò±,btohqsg
Most of the time it's not worth it unless you are using 4mpd/5% cashback cards,btohqsg
Hi all  what do you think of Crypto Ruby (2%) cashback card vs UOB One lol!,btohqsg
I'm still questioning my life on whether I shld venture into cyrpto as I'm mainly US equities and stocks now,btohqsg

I started to follow bitcoin since 2012,btohqsg
but the most popular exchange available was mt gox that went bust later üòÇ,btohqsg
@boontee86are u the boon tee that just appeared on Kelvin channel?,btohqsg
The 2% is paid back in CRO but quite hassle free. Recently CRO price just went up  so for the same $500 stake you will have less CRO. There are still certain categories which are not entitled to the 2%.,btohqsg
@boontee86could u reccomended what is the least risky way for newbie to do options? Long Vs short? Put Vs call. What in the money out of the money. Naked Vs cash secured,btohqsg
Learn the basic first  watch the 3 hours video that@ChrisHMSGhas shared earlier and understand the technical side of things like the option payoff diagram  the greeks like delta  gamma,btohqsg
Not sure which brokerage offers paper trading on options  then can try out first,btohqsg
Bear in mind that options (except for the LEAPS)  is generally a short-term trading strategy e.g. you are either betting on the direction of the share price  or betting on the volatility. So if you have no idea on the direction to bet  then better don't touch options,btohqsg
@boontee86hmm but why would u do it on high vol stocks tho? I don't want those meme stocks. Like u said 1 major loss can wipe out all your past returns.And also  if you're very bullish on certain stocks to do put options  but can't afford to buy 100 of it  then how?,btohqsg
for stocks that are too stable like Apple  Facebook  the implied vol is very low. It is like you are selling insurance but you are only receiving little money,btohqsg
I wonder what's@ChrisHMSG's view on options? Do you do any options?,btohqsg
I only sell puts when I see the ER super good but the stock still fall like crap.Previously sold a $190 Call on ENPH and burnt  luckily closed before it went above $200,btohqsg
That said  I Sold two ENPH puts before selling the call to make sure I'm covered both sides,btohqsg
icic... so at worst called away  limit the upside üôèüèª,btohqsg

UOB One is a 5% cashback provided you can fulfill the onerous terms(1) 2K per month for 3 months(2) each month must have at least 5 transactionsif you have a big purchase that you can consistently split over time  then sure this makes a lot of sense,btohqsg
I useCrypto.comRuby 2% (now Indigo for 3%) only for transactions that would not earn me anything elsewherelike medical bills for example which is on the exclusion list for many,btohqsg
Example can be use BNPL services like Atome,btohqsg
Groceries is easy 8% onCiti CashbackMaybank FnF,btohqsg
Citi cashback is the 1.5% one?,btohqsg
No  it's the 8% oneCiti cashback+ is the 1.6%,btohqsg
ohhh okay  paiseh  more into miles gameüòÇ,btohqsg
"Yeah i have videos on it  just search ""citi credit cards singapore"" on youtube",btohqsg

960 BTO flats in Rochor have been launched for sale under HDB's new scheme for prime area property.A total of 4 501 BTO flats were launched across 6 estates  including Hougang and Kallang Whampoa.Details:https://cna.asia/3HwWuaa,btohqsg
I can never afford a bto cos they are 6 digits  probably need to work until 40/50+ years old. So rather not waste $ on a devaluating asset and invest instead,btohqsg
u don't pay the entire 6 digits upfront right?,btohqsg
if u put in 20 percent down payment on a 500k flat which is 100k and after 5 years let say if u can sell it and make a 100k profit nett of finance charges  legal fees and stamp duty etc. it would be a 100 percent return on your original investment.,btohqsg
