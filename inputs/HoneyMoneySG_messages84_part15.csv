i just got approved for amex plat  120k annual and above using my stock trading income,btohqsg
Hello anyone got problems signing up for the UOB rising dragon promo? Can‚Äôt seem to submit the form,btohqsg
You login to Singpass app and click Finance. Then you'll see what income they are looking at. As of today  they'll probably only see 2022's income (NOA 2023).,btohqsg
Citi Rewards + Amaze or for me personally i use UOB Privi + Amaze,btohqsg
Alright  which means you need to declare your stock trading income for year 2022 and it got approve using my info ( which they drive income from 2022 NOA ) ?,btohqsg
Show us how much your iras taxes Lor. Talk is cheap lol,btohqsg
You're right  it shows 2022 income which i didnt hit 120k  which means I need to wait for latest NOA before I can apply,btohqsg
Not sure if you can find ways to appeal with other statements.When I apply for my first cc with DBS  they tried to use the SAL crediting on my account and rejected because lower than 30k.I sent them the NOA they accepted. Not sure if you can do the opposite instead (like your salary crediting for the year is higher than the current NOA).,btohqsg
when we apply credit card is using myinfo  so I send them the documents after application?,btohqsg
Try first don‚Äôt worry others comment. Your income is for yourself worst case is wait a while and it shall be yours.. unless you want centurion card üòÇ,btohqsg
I think they will ask you to provide other statements to appeal if they reject. So just apply first.,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice  appreciate it much. If rejected. How soon we can apply it again,btohqsg
I don't think there's a limit but if the appeal fail can just try again when your NOA is for 2023 ba,btohqsg
Amaze + Citi Rewards Single Card Strategy is useful within Singapore (or) in Overseas?,btohqsg
Can the salary crediting be transferred from another account like the UOB one salary credit trick?,btohqsg

Applying for my first credit cards soon after getting first paycheck. Seems like a lot of options (cards with attractive sign-up bonus  general spending cards  specific category spending cards  etc.)...Will applying for these multiple cards at once negatively affect credit score or cause subsequent card applications to be rejected? Or should I space out the applications with a month or two in between?,btohqsg
Hi all  just to check if I hold a UOB PRIV MILES card  and apply thru the app for UOB lady solitaire is there likely a chance they will approve. Annual salary less than 120k,btohqsg
Or should I try the entry one and request upgrade few months later,btohqsg
Can apply the basic one then try to upgrade. There are a lot of people who managed to get even without 120k annual income.,btohqsg
Can the UOB lady pair with Amaze?,btohqsg
What is the earn rate when using in foreign country?,btohqsg
Any idea if topping up foreign country transport pass count as travel category?,btohqsg

Take with pinch of salt.I haven‚Äôt heard any banks base credit card approval on trading stocks income.They can use it as a reference to improve their comfort on u  but such income can‚Äôt be used to satisfy mas credit card guidelines.,btohqsg

Buying in JPY. Was told it is best to topup on amaze using uob krisflyer and then pay using Amaze card,btohqsg
But was told by Uob that topup have no  miles. So I am bit confused.,btohqsg
hi guys  can i check if you use the citi rewards + amaze combo  how much needs to be spent before $200 annual fee can be waived? or cannot waive annual fee at all?,btohqsg
dun topup. use Amaze card linked with uob krisflyer,btohqsg
how to request for waiver? need to spend how much?,btohqsg
call in to waive. Should be easily waivable,btohqsg
Was told by amaze using wallet to spend get 1% instead of 0.5%,btohqsg
But nearly overlooked that uob don't give miles for topup!,btohqsg
yes but no benefit on the cc,btohqsg
What is the best card to link with amaze card?,btohqsg
I only know it must be Mastercard.,btohqsg
