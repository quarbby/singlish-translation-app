Guys  wanna check besides EBC redstuff  any similar affordable ceramic brake pads you guys using?,btohqsg
Sian of stock.. Worn out time to change,btohqsg
this kind of mod is the type that you can do without.,btohqsg
The only reason I see myself going with ceramic pads is lesser brake dust,btohqsg
For a daily driver that is,btohqsg
Pete will tell you don't even need brakes,btohqsg
Pete will tell you to go Bluetooth brakes and wifi wheels,btohqsg
You’ll wear your rotors faster  is that worth it? Haha,btohqsg
Lol.. So no need atas ceramic,btohqsg
You also won’t heat up your brakes,btohqsg

Also  TIL Yellowstuff is no longer suitable for track use unless you bed it like a maniac,btohqsg
I notice some cars mileage states as NA. Why is that?,btohqsg
Cus mileage too high. Turns potential buyers off,btohqsg
Honestly I hate it cus need to PM dealer just to see mileage,btohqsg
Some dealers don’t want to be liable for fake mileage  so that’s a red flag  must inspect the car carefully,btohqsg
