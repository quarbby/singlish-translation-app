SGExams  not SGTekongMy fellow NSFs  we get that NS is a very large portion of your current lives now but at a certain point talking about the army kind of goes way beyond the scope of anexams/academic/studentgroup chat. It's time to move on to greener pastures (literally  since y'all going into the jungle lmao) and allow people to have conversations that aren't necessarily about NS.To enforce this  we have decided to introduce a sticker than you can use to gently remind people that they're spending all their free time talking about the thing that prevents them from having more free time. So  whenever someone starts talking about their NS experiences for 5 hours in the chat  you can always tell them:,btohqsg
But we are not privates  we are TSCs,btohqsg
my man joined just to use the sticker...,btohqsg
when will we have a no “no ns sticker” sticker,btohqsg
