i think amex generally very bad rewards. so the balance 1-2k spending must see what your usual spending is on before can advise,btohqsg
i think i’m in the same situation as you. for me  i’m going to explore miles and just applied for the uob lady solitaire card. i’m thinking to explore traveling again hence the decision,btohqsg
Another question  if I decide to explore Miles option  do u think Amex metal card or UOB infinite Metal card to spend all amounts on it ? Overseas every year once,btohqsg
Which credit card should I use for insurance payment? All credit card have nerf insurance payment for minimum spending and also cashback/miles ?,btohqsg
For miles I think Kris flyer CC + amaze is the best for no cap spending. But you must be able to at least spend 800/ year on SIA / scoot.,btohqsg
Is it possible to use YouTrip with GxS?,btohqsg
Hi. Can anyone share?If i buy NTUC vouchers  does it counted as qualify spending for the cashback for dbs yuu credit card?If yes  can i buy through apps or counter better? Thanks in advance for the advice.🙏,btohqsg
Need to spend within the categories listed also hahah,btohqsg
Ntuc is not yuu merchant so no you won't get the 18% ...,btohqsg
Thanks.Paiseh i am referring to the $350 cashback promo.,btohqsg
At covers most of your major spend. Dining  online shopping  grab. Flight  hotel. Combo with amaze.But when u go overseas buy bag buy cosmetics buy alcohol can accumulate miles.Only exclusions you use your 2nd card.,btohqsg
Methoros or Andrew u refer to KrisFlyer CC  any preference from which bank ?,btohqsg
Only UOB have. The mastercard version.,btohqsg
Also got Amex Krisflyer card  but the posts are referring to the UOB one,btohqsg
Yupp uob kf 3mpd unlimited on categories listed. Need to spend 800 on sq products in a year. Only issue this card is 1.2 mpd award initially other 1.8 comes on 1 year plus later. And no option for other transfer partners all auto go into krisflyer acc,btohqsg
Yep downside mainly the minimum 800 / year SIA co. spend.and bonus points at card year end.,btohqsg
800/year on SIA spend - Can I purchase air tickets or scoot to offset that min $800 ?,btohqsg
Yes can sq or scoot tickets eligible.Note your extra 1.8 mpd only comes in 1 year later.,btohqsg
If you're a miles chaser.Best is still spend 500 ish on Uob one for bonus interest. Then remaining on another card.If not just stick to 2k on Uob One card works as well for the cash back.,btohqsg
If I purchase ticket $800/yearly for scoot or SQ  meaning I can spend on dining & get back 3 Qris mile for every $1 spend ?,btohqsg
When pay is in should transfer out all. Then 1st of every month u deposit at least $510. But remember to transfer out all the interest amount as well.,btohqsg
Yes.But not just dining. Online shopping and department stores too. Remember to combo with amaze card to make everything online spend.There are some exclusions.,btohqsg
Remember the possibility of you not willing to pay the credit card annual fee n all the 1.8 mpd bonus miles earned for last one year forfeited by banks.,btohqsg
I think you can just ask to waive the annual fee.,btohqsg
Combo with Amaze card - for rebates right ?,btohqsg
You can use the keyword “Card insurance” to search chat history related to this query.,btohqsg
Need to take the risks. They may approve or may not approve based on DP provided by others.,btohqsg
Is there any UOB Lady cards for male ? I heard there is one for male right ?,btohqsg
I know it expired already but I want to learn for next time:Is there any downside to apply for the AMEX instead of Visa?,btohqsg
Anything better than SG fullerton fund yet safer ?,btohqsg
"There is no ""Men's card"" if that's what you're asking. Just that now men can apply for Lady's Card as well. Last time only limited to women.",btohqsg
Just milk the lady card asap who knows what will happen,btohqsg
UOB Lady card is for men too.,btohqsg
Any of the Lady card right ? Think the metal cards get the best benefit. Can choose 2 out of 6 rewards categories to get 15x Uni$,btohqsg
The metal one is invite-only and charges AF. Solitaire has the same benefits but must be earning > $120k,btohqsg
Hey guys  fave pay doesn’t give any miles for dbs credit cards right? (Woman’s World),btohqsg
You can use the keyword “Dbs fave” to search chat history related to this query.,btohqsg
Not sure what is the best way to educate people to use search function 😅,btohqsg
For starters  not using the word ‘educate’ would likely help the receiving party not feel patronised.My suggestion would be: “Good question  I’m not too sure what the answer is but you may try to search on the chat if someone else had the same concern. good luck!”,btohqsg
You are good in English writing 👍,btohqsg
to withdraw money from youtrip in malaysia  i need to top up sgd into ny youtrip account then convert the sgd to ringgit first before being able to withdraw is it?,btohqsg
From my personal experience  it doesn’t matter if you converted it  youtrip will take from whichever of the 10 currencies has enough to fulfill the withdrawal.,btohqsg
YouTrip don't support MYR wallet. So it takes from SGD (and other currency wallets if not enough).,btohqsg
If you want a MYR balacne  use wise. Additionally for places that don’t accept Visa  you can link your wise card to TouchnGo wallet and pay with QR code with no fees,btohqsg
ohhhh thank you so much !!!!,btohqsg
Takes time  but I think it's ok to ask repeated as long as it's not brought up too often  especially given how rapid bank change policies these days,btohqsg
"YouTrip only have 11 currency wallets so you can ""lock in"" the rate by converting your currency to the desired currency. Take it like you went to money exchange go change money  but instead of cash  it's in a e-Wallet.For the remaining currencies  it would be on real-time exchange rate. Take it like you're swiping your debit card. But when you swipe your YouTrip card  remember to select local currency (not SGD) so that conversion is done by YouTrip.",btohqsg
Come back remember change local currency can liao.. got one time I paid simplygo with Thai baht without realizing (was Revolut promo for public transport) 😂,btohqsg
Yes started deposit in March. 4 months should be until June. Didn’t add extra deposits into the account after march. Now is July. Haven’t see any interest come in. 😅😅 by end August?,btohqsg
Will Citi Rewards + Amaze get 10x points for simplygo?,btohqsg
