Has anyone tried tada app? How does it match against grab when booking cab rides ? Is tada cheaper ?,btohqsg
Tada is faster to get car for me. Price is not always cheaper (maybe 2 out of 3 times cheaper). The app looks less polished but it works.,btohqsg

OCBC rewards don’t work like Citi Rewards  there’s a whitelist of MCCs that are eligible for 4mpd  and selected few that are eligible for 6mpd. The 6mpd special changes every quarter.,btohqsg

Why is my Instaram amaze card suddenly on 18/6 declined in transaction? 😭Anyone experiencing the same,btohqsg
This is bad is there any way to check when will it be resolved? I looked up on their Facebook it didn't says anything,btohqsg
When I was overseas  I had one establishment that kept getting rejected. Amaze said it was rejected under their internal review guidelines too. No further explanation.,btohqsg
That is terrible I got the same too I am now panickingThis might force me back to using normal ATM nets card if it continue,btohqsg
Do you consistently spend >1k every month or only occasionally to absorb any spend that are >1k but <2k  wondering whether it's easy to get annual fee waived. And also wonder whether UOB considers spendings on other cards like when considering waiving annual fee.,btohqsg
I use it to supplement other card when fully clock or use it for fcy spending. Usually have no issue waiving uob card  i do think they take overall spending as considering i have more then 10 card with uob,btohqsg
Wow you remembered !!How does it looks like? All good ?,btohqsg
