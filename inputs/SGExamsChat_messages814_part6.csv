"the sentiment is alot of bosses feel like spending any amt of resource on any employee to help them advance their career is already very offputting.So usually the ""sort of is able"" generally always lies in the jobscope of things you have alr been scheduled to do as the employee under your role. Unless external factors  you will remain doing the same thing for quite a few years before you actually get introduced to new ideas and concepts",btohqsg
i study  but one day before As,btohqsg

Like for paper 2 gp I always study all the synonyms and antonyms,btohqsg

But honestly speaking I this one is the boss mentality liao,btohqsg
Till this day I have no idea what a vocab or verb is,btohqsg
"Cus they always want ""in your own words"" kind of qns",btohqsg
It is a concept  thing or idea basically,btohqsg

"This is why the fresh grads now are trying to intern or at least work a yr or two at govt companies..gain skills and use the better ""work life balance"" to further their studies..then once they fill like they are confident enough then pivot to a startup or private companies",btohqsg
coz sometimes my word paraphrasing becomes more than 1 word,btohqsg
i mean summary isn't a one for one replacement,btohqsg
"But for me my teacher was like ""I want yall to create a notebook whereby yall compile all your synonyms  antonyms and words that you shld not use  etc etc""'",btohqsg
GP is just yapplogy as a subject,btohqsg
Like whenever wr come across a paper and need to do corrections,btohqsg
prob is generally most boss mentality is they will cut cost where possible..and if cost is spend on training employees...that they feel like is a short term benefit. they will cut it,btohqsg

"Anyways its very evident majority of companies with ""work/life balance"" are govt companies excluding those in defense.They are most likely always the company to always give their employees a chance of upskilling etc..they are the ones that dont mind if you jump ship  infact alot of the seniors that work 20-40 yrs  all look to those younger ones that decided to jump ship after working for 1-2 yrs at a govt corp or job with admiration",btohqsg
