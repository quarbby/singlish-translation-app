hmm I sent a friend before,btohqsg
1) Sponsor - might have strong financial backing. Capitaland  Keppel  Mapletree comes to mind here.Aims REIT was originally meant as a turnaround play for me that worked well2) NAV - Ideally get below NAV. It's like buying a property below its actual price.Bonus if the NAV was due to property valuation that wasn't as updated  and is SG property. Because valuations should have gone up by now.3) Yield. To take the risks  we need higher yield. This varies according to the types of properties as well.Industrial should be the highest as the lease is usually lower at least for within SG. Followed by offices  then malls.Hospitals usually lowest. Exception was FIRST Reit who sold their SG hospitals and moved to Indo  and kenna big time from their sponsors there.4) Gearing. Don't want a REIT that borrowed too much  like that kenna high interest  and no room for expansion.Don't want a REIT that borrowed too little  that means leverage not enough. Most REITs do this well  so no issue.5) Geographical. I like SG related ones as we can see. Capital China Trust was an exception as I wanted some exposure to China  but indirectly. I don't really like US and Europe ones last time  and so far proven correct unfortunately for those who bought in.6) Anchor tenants concentration. Generally if the anchor tenant is a major portion of the rental income  this is a major risks if the anchor tenant decides to stop. The reit that kenna big time was Sabana reit. At that time  they also restrict themselves to being Shariah Compliant  which was really dumb imo. They probably realised that years later  and finally stopped.If the anchor tenant is also the sponsor  then there may also be a risk of preferential treatment. Again Sabana reit comes to mind here.7) WALE ‚Äî Weighted Average Lease Expiry. Lease renewal should be what we look for in a higher interest rate environment. Such an environment generally will see lease renewed at higher rates.,btohqsg
Add on to that  I also noticed a perfect technical falling wedge set up that matches a support level from earlierso I went all in,btohqsg
