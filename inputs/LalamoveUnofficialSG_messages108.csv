I just delivered cash order. This person ask me for paynow  so benefit of the doubt  i trusted his screenshot because he mention my paynow name. Then i realise money not in.I ask him for the screenshot. And the screenshot he sent was transfer to a bank account number instead of my mobile.Assuming screenshot was sent wrong. Otherwise it was intended to be fake. Yall be careful.,btohqsg
Thanks for great reminder to see properly n check paynow is received then press delivered.If not we slap ourselves as llm deduct tax n info feeThanks for the scammers alert.Did llm help to gets the payment from them ?,btohqsg
Update :I confronted the person through whatsapp (so that ive black & white) and he insisted he transferred. So after exposing the weird timing of the screenshot timed at 2.10am when i only delivered the item at 2.35am  he LL and paynow me immediately.And he admitted that he transfer between his own account. (So meaning he intentionally wants to cheat)Please take note guys. Every order are hard earned money and those cash order  this kind of people wants to try scamming for $23.50.So take a minute to make sure transfers are made and in your bank before going off.,btohqsg
Just make report lor. He was unlucky kena by u. Dont know how many times he did before,btohqsg
Hi guys be careful of Concorde Hotel / Muslim delights jobs. Cash job  was told pay now after delivery with proof of pics. After delivery no payment. Called them say will pay now. Then missing.

Anybody else facing same issue can report together.,btohqsg

They use brain to be as cheapo as possible.üòÇ Platform does nothing about it.,btohqsg

So u completed the Canberra to cck job then they deduct?,btohqsg
The false order deduction shld show under what job id,btohqsg
U just go check n tally. If wrongly deduct then tmr livechat with cs n tell them,btohqsg
I‚Äôve checked. It was an order I took  but they ( CS ) cancelled instead last week.,btohqsg
Screen shot and sent them via their link. Wat the hell seriously. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
was the order given to u late?,btohqsg
why u keep focusing on llm bag sia. haha.,btohqsg
It was they themselves ( CS ) cancelled the order. Lol... and they I Kenna suspend for a day.,btohqsg
Erm .... can really remember actually. Too many places I‚Äôve sent. üòÖ,btohqsg
u need to chat with CS tml with the order ID . hope u meet someone senior. some CS are noob. I ever met before once ... the CS doesn't knot what happened then straight end the chat pretend nothing happened. knn. lol,btohqsg
Then again it‚Äôs near my place for starters  so logically I couldn‚Äôt had cancelled it. Anyway it stated CS cancellation.,btohqsg
I thought u like llm bag so much. lol. I don't even have a bag. haha,btohqsg
Yeah ... their live chat is really legendary. Ur on your own when shit goes down.,btohqsg
really.. then I created another chat.. once the chat started I start to scold the CS liao hahaha,btohqsg
app never ask me to take any photo of the bag before leh,btohqsg

Dont bullshit here. He void the called becoz of sending cough syrup. Dont try to be innocent here,btohqsg
O wow.Too many scammers n Illegal stuffs,btohqsg
i bid on a few orders  all got the lalabag message,btohqsg
and never got any of them,btohqsg
Common ar bro. U ask this guy to put the things inside the dry riser instead of giving to the person itself. And u say u some raya stuff consist of money for raya.,btohqsg
If im the sender i will surely do the same thing as what he did. Y must put inside the dry riser? Yes we have no right to open customer stuff. But its too suspicious might be some drugs. And it really 2 bottles of cough syrup. So he throw it away,btohqsg
Last week my friend took an order around late night. The instruction from the customer also the same thing put inside on the dry riser. And he met with a rd block. The police check on his bag and the packaging consist of cough syrup and some pills. And for that they send him to lock up for investigation,btohqsg
if you take proper photo and uploaded into llm app order then don't have to worry.,btohqsg
LLM is used for drug trafficking these days... cheap labor... no need pay high fee,btohqsg
I ever took a cash order  ah beng with tattoo came down pass me the parcel. all sealed up. haha. I shake shake .. confirm is e-cig. lol. send to geylang somemore.,btohqsg
Or maybe the other pple bidding against us have sticker/bags üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
The thing is  for car job  even if I get the bag  I will prob lose bid if the other car has sticker?,btohqsg
Bag still lose to sticker I suppose?,btohqsg
For me it's random. It's more likely to appear during off peak period where like what u said order volume is low.,btohqsg
I heard can don't put sticker but commission will be higher,btohqsg
I don't think those without bag/stickers r restricted bah. I still feel it happens when we r bidding against those with bag/stickers. Unless I keep kena same resto order which keeps on showing the bag/sticker msgüòÇ,btohqsg
I took Ron 97 n Ron üíØ   haven‚Äôt try v-power,btohqsg
So ur drivg mpv to do bike orders only ah? Wah quite tough for ur fuel consumption wor,btohqsg

SGD 1.76 per litre still better than here $3.13,btohqsg
Confirmed no need to put stickers. I didn‚Äôt put sticker but indeed higher commission.,btohqsg
I also don‚Äôt know what is happening ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Oh I don‚Äôt have to. When I changed to MPV  I was able to take the job instantly.,btohqsg
It was in late Feb this year,btohqsg
I saw this notice but I ignored. Texted lala and I was told the sticker is optional,btohqsg
Yup and I even asked if I can take job instantly and they said yes,btohqsg
I have been doing a lot of MPV jobs since then,btohqsg
WhatsApp your car details to this number +65 8831 3122,btohqsg
Yes plus insurance  log card and lease agreement if rental car,btohqsg
I see.. not easy getting mpv job,btohqsg
Plenty of MPV jobs but a lot of shit jobs. Haha,btohqsg
Agree with you. Peak hours not wise to do.,btohqsg
Yes.. i take twice and thats it.  No more.. üòÇ,btohqsg
Guys  how do i cxl job? Coz i have double booking suddenly lala app lagged ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Ya man need to wait till tmr,btohqsg
Wah luckily cust cxl liao üôèüôè,btohqsg
Once the change of car to MPV has been updated  I can see MPV jobs.,btohqsg
Is it similar to LALAMOVE delivery jobs??,btohqsg
is wish considered a mpv or must be like Alphard big type then considered mpv,btohqsg
Can don't have I think but comm higher,btohqsg
Tbh even though i drive MPV and can take mpv orders  I maybe take 1 or 2 mpv orders out of 10-15orders,btohqsg
1 is that there are lesser2 is that they are usually back breaking jobs,btohqsg
Maybe 10-20% higher than car job but the jobs available is lesser,btohqsg
I just email them to change car details to mpv and they change right away,btohqsg
Mpv no need sticker.. comm 18%,btohqsg
My opinion  if they dont need you toget the sticker can consider changing  cuz its an additional range of jobs you can take,btohqsg
Is in lalamove apps bro under faq,btohqsg
I took an ikea delivery job,btohqsg
After that i toom lesser liao,btohqsg
Yes  mpv can take all orders mpv and below tier. No sticker no priority unfortunetly,btohqsg
It's an additional tier of jobs available. If mpv n don't need sticker shld just register as mpv,btohqsg
Mpv jobs might be more back breaking  but have a few more options. Sometimes have not so heavy stuff  but rareüòÇ,btohqsg
This is according to my friend who is using mpv for lalamove,btohqsg
Go for it  anytg is better than doing walker with car,btohqsg
Yes  thats true. Sometimes will have big things that are not heavy,btohqsg
Ya just dont book appointment for sticker,btohqsg
So the 18% comm is only for mpv jobs or all  including car n bike?,btohqsg
All bro.. if u non mpv your comm is 16% but once u register mpv all job u do regardless bike  car or mpv is 18%,btohqsg
That might come off wrongly for the new folks; the 16-18% commission is charged to the person doing the LLM delivery  to be given to LLM themselves.Delivery folks get 82-84% of the fees indicated on the Drivers App.,btohqsg
Motorcycle can fetch 4 boxes of durian cakes?,btohqsg
If is cream cake. Better dun take,btohqsg
Chances of crash if cake is high,btohqsg
Cheapskate sia‚Ä¶..prefer car then go order a car Lah this customer,btohqsg
Ignore easier. Never ending all these weird requests. Bike order carry tv  bed. Car need fetch how many pax‚Ä¶..haha,btohqsg
Place closed n hp not on,btohqsg
wow lol how come still have order one üòÇ,btohqsg

Hi Driver Partners! Be careful of any scam orders that you may come across on the platform! Do not transfer money if requested and do not purchase any gift cards (i.e Apple iTunes) and send the photo of the codes to the users. Ensure that you receive the amount from users FIRST before purchasing ANY items!If you do come across such orders  do not proceed with the purchase  inform Customer Service live chat (between 8AM-10PM) and we will advise on the next course of action. Do spread this to your family members and friends who are fellow Lalamovers!,btohqsg

Certain timing got more orders than drivers,btohqsg
Cannot be helped. Many pple out there need to make the money desperately for a living,btohqsg
U see orders keep coming non stop,btohqsg

anyone drives a hybrid/electric here? how is the range like for yall?,btohqsg
That's good for a wk wor. On average 1 mth u can make abt 6k after diesel cost?,btohqsg
I drive electric mpv  range is agar 400km- charging cost ard $30,btohqsg
Depends on charger  but its the only EV that can fast charge on AC,btohqsg
So SP AC43 from 10% to full is ard 2hrs,btohqsg
I will use AC at shopping malls,btohqsg
Yeah  more and more on the road,btohqsg
But its a very spartan car,btohqsg
Even though its an EV  the tech and stuff on the car machiam early 2000,btohqsg
Bad part bout it is back seat cannot fold,btohqsg
Its like driving a year 2005 car,btohqsg
No cruise controlNo folding back seatNo folding mirrorInterior all plasticFront windscreen tend to fog upCar Finishing alot of nitty gritty issues like not aligned and stuff,btohqsg
But its ev range is the longest(max i reach 460km)Can charge receiving nearly 40kw AC(most other evs cap out at 11)Battery is very reliable(BYD blade battery),btohqsg
Overall  I dont regret trading in my Xtrail for this car,btohqsg
EV will not take off if there no charging STN in every single carpark in Sg... we not bigger country where most ppl stay landed n able to charge from comfort of home,btohqsg
buy car for convenience not to have more trouble,btohqsg
Its actually more convienient than you think,btohqsg
More and more shopping malls have charging station or charging station near malls,btohqsg
we need more at HDB n condo cp,btohqsg
Every dot on here is charger  even though some is blue sg charger,btohqsg
most critical part is cost n availability of models ... not much choices at the moment,btohqsg
So it will be about 40-50k more,btohqsg
Cuz battery smaller capacity i think,btohqsg
Byd is supposed ro be cheap,btohqsg
ah tiong will laugh at usüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
This is the price they buy in rmb,btohqsg
150k rmb is their selling price if they wanna sell,btohqsg
No hor is hw much byd sg earn,btohqsg
Gov take gst and coe only,btohqsg
I heard they still got gahmen subsidy if take up EV. sg is charge you gow gow... u still tink they really want a green environmentüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
BYD no more production for fuel car  they fully focus on EV,btohqsg
there's ARF tax. pap aready earn 120% tax for every car value u buy,btohqsg
Actually byd car very good since 5-6years ago le,btohqsg
All other cars yes.. but E6 no,btohqsg
no Coe they aso huat till siao,btohqsg
Want to convert  now best time. While gov still keeping up the subsidies,btohqsg
Oh  BYD used to make ICE vehicles?,btohqsg
Yup byd started with making ice cars,btohqsg
Yes  but market share very minimum in China. So they give up,btohqsg
Their early cars were modeled after toyota altis,btohqsg
Den they have the dynasty series,btohqsg
Chinese ppl will choose byd if they go for economy type EV,btohqsg
The new E6 is the EV version of ÂÆãmax which is 1.5L ice car,btohqsg
But TBH China have more and more EVs competitor now,btohqsg
Xiao Peng  Wei Lai all those,btohqsg
They can have their own charging station in Carpark,btohqsg
Ah thank you thank you. I only heard of them just in 2019  I swakoo without Class 3/3A üòÖ,btohqsg

All depend on what you want,btohqsg
Wait for 1-2 years more  will have more option,btohqsg
They may even create separate COE for EV,btohqsg
wait till Coe go back 20k. by then e6 less than 70küòÇüòÇ. more than cover whatever subsidyüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
