hello  can anyone help me with comparison btwn UOB krisflyer and UOB prvimiles? Looking to use it as general spend card after other cards.1) Leaning towards prvimiles as not very interested in locking in on krisflyer only and also because it will pool with other uob cards.2) krisflyer card need 800 spend on the few specific before earning 3mpd.3) krisflyer card converts to miles instantly hence faster expiry.so uhm what pros are there for krisflyer over prvi?,btohqsg
say bigger ticket stuff? bc will have citirewards for online  dbs wmmc for travel,btohqsg

I applied uob ladies. I gotten a sms saying Your UOB Card/CashPlus application is successful. Your new card(s) will be sent within the next few days. Please call UOB Customer Service for other queries.How do I access the uob app for now?,btohqsg
choose the Amaze wallet with insufficient fund as the default 'card',btohqsg
CF bank run liao. When all promote chocolate finance good yet each time all these recommendations end up causing people to have money stuck in the account. Cannot withdraw already.Previously I also trusted all these content creator like ftx  hodlnaut  anchor protocol. End up all run. But our money gone.While these creators already earned a ton of referral fees. This is so shady.,btohqsg
for uob  usually is 6 months prior to whatever promotion. Will state in T&C,btohqsg
2 days ago CF allow withdrawal.,btohqsg
"It's better to wait for the instant withdrawal to be back before withdrawing. Else there will be a ""wait time"" where your money is not earning interest.",btohqsg

Hi everyone. With instarem being nerf  may I check what's the next option? As I spend within $1k every month only.Food: I would pay with instarem paired with CitiPetrol: I pump in msia every week  using instarem paired with Citi as well.Groceries: Buy in msia paired with Citi as well.Can anyone give me options which card to go for next? Doesn't matter if it's in cashback or miles. Previously I choose this because one card can do all so don't have to apply multiple cards. Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
