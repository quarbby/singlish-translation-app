that bus never saw service under that livery and was repainted and became a private bus,btohqsg
How about another cursed picture lmao,btohqsg
my eyes haven't seen worse days than this,btohqsg
nothing to see here  not like seeing a modern day sbs bus on something that looks like it came from the 1960s,btohqsg
what wld be ur reaction if lets say we replace cheese on pizza with barbecue sauce?,btohqsg
yea nvm i can't really make u eyebleach i guess :/,btohqsg
unless u wanna know this fact that there is a vocation in the air force where u will still be in the air force but u will wear the green uni,btohqsg
you know whats even worse? There is literally no backstory about this bus or even why this bus was repainted,btohqsg
trying to think of one ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Its like a urban legend in singapore,btohqsg
i think so its that i forgor its name,btohqsg
THEN WHATS THE POINT OF EVEN HAVING SBS TRANSIT LIVERY,btohqsg
yes best use of it ðŸ—¿,btohqsg

im going with my family to paya lebar at 11pm ltr for hdl,btohqsg

try searching OC 500 LE on google,btohqsg
you'll either see the SMRT white/red livery or the pandan green one,btohqsg
iirc only SMRT had the OC 500 LEs  and SBS transit never had one  so its cursed to see a bus thats owned by SMRT in SBST livery....,btohqsg
btw  i know a bus that is def cute,btohqsg
That momment you realise  We make busses for hong kong in singapore,btohqsg
my father told  me its easy to down pes,btohqsg
just say you are allergic to something plausible,btohqsg
i heard ppl who have claimed they are allergic to pollen and get a down pes,btohqsg
give me a sec  i may have a reason,btohqsg
should be able to downpes with this right?,btohqsg
imagine it becomes a massive wart,btohqsg
wht you think of my downpes reason?,btohqsg
moral of the story: always try,btohqsg
"1 encik told me ""you want down pes? you go stand at the railing shout i want to jump down can alr""",btohqsg
is my reason credible to downpes?,btohqsg
i know 1 dude downpes for flat feet,btohqsg
but his bmt was 6 years ago ah,btohqsg
"Wednesday i tried chaokeng the MO said ""you are the doctor or am i the doctor""",btohqsg
you barely can even see the toes,btohqsg
bro help my feet is so flat and it hurts when i run long distances,btohqsg
like theres a sharp pain on both feet when i run more than 3 km,btohqsg
i told my foot doctor (forgot the name) that and she was like yeAh its possible that it may be because of flatfeet but abit iffy cuz she couldnt really tie the pain to the flatfeet condition.,btohqsg
in conclusion i told my MO during checkup and hopefully can downpes! also my flatfoot is pretty severe its almost completely flat,btohqsg
any jc kids wanna study date,btohqsg
