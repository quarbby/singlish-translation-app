I haved watched the video  I am new to reduce income tax thingy. I am a PR so I only have individual $1000 tax reduction. If my aim is to save money to buy hdb in 3-5 years time  should I put my cash in CPF or SRS account better? Thank you.,btohqsg
Yes  this is the way for churning.As long as hotel/restaurant MCC is not excluded.E.g. Hotel is not eligible for most citi Cards,btohqsg
Depends on whether you believe in CPF.But usually just keep your relief to make income at 40k level is good enough,btohqsg
As I know if I put in SRS  if I want to withdraw later they will have 5% charge  if I put in CPF  can I choose to put it into OA account and am I able to withdraw it later like 3-5 years later? Thanks.,btohqsg
Simple answer is no. Long answer is both are not meant to take out in 3-5 years,btohqsg
3-5 years just take SSB at 3%++,btohqsg
