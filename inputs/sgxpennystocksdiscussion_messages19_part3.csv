Too far fetched to fathomLike how well prepared we are since sarsThe rest is clear to see,btohqsg
Haha big fish eat small fish,btohqsg
Making money is a skillLosing money is an art,btohqsg
Ya we will know next week when result made know to us,btohqsg
Ya either pm Lee think too far or there is some info kept public in dark,btohqsg
End of the day if u are in any counter... Make ur own judgment and not to rely too much on outside voice.. Every one have their own agenda. Of cos there are some shifu who really help like furion,btohqsg
VP not only doing test kit for medical segment right? It also says for global supply,btohqsg
Any one know about the evoluation of  virus? will be lighter or serioius?,btohqsg
Is there a MT group? Pls add me,btohqsg
Ya vp forefront medical not only do test kit and arrow medical now supply ppe in uk,btohqsg
U may go to their website to see,btohqsg
üëçüèª this is where the majority get blinded by ‚Äòcovid related business‚Äô you went so deep in i feel my previous statement was peanuts üòÇ,btohqsg
Cost of swab test charge by Gov.,btohqsg
U all keep forgetting one thing  all these announcement is late Jun  july or even august news. Do u think it has impact on the quarter ended 31/7!,btohqsg
ya all this info provided was before Mr heng advertise for them on late June and July where believe result made known before they managed to secure 5 to 7 contract for covid related medical stuff,btohqsg
We will see on the coming weeks probably it will get beneficial on q3 and may more on q4,btohqsg
This probably not only supply to local govt but to other country as well,btohqsg
Maybe for test kit but not other as they provide other stuff related covid 19,btohqsg
As past month due to global supply shortage of material of test kits so forefront medical by using 3D-printing and a manufacturing process known as injection moulding.This has given Singapore the capability and know-how to produce its own swabs.,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt what ah heng has visited and said all under medical segment?,btohqsg
oh... vicplas also produced many other medical supplies like tube  rubber seals etc  which are in huge demand too by hosiptals/pharmaceutical factories etc.. as matter of facts  lesser competitors in this field  as these products required to be manufactured in the very high standards of ISO and GMP certified plants...  this is indeed required a very specialised knowledge ...üëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
Just share info what has made known to public,btohqsg
This estimated 9.5m includes other medical devices like ppe?,btohqsg
I think they have kept them under very profile... may be bound by the agreement signed with customers   as they are ODM/OEM manufacturer...,btohqsg
I think is time to change to another topic   too much on this company... is a weekend... let's chill out...bro...,btohqsg
I‚Äôm no enemy of Vicplas. Somehow I feel there are a lot of info trying to prove a point im too bearish on their performanceI would be most glad to see some forecast or analysis on their coming results to have a fruitful discussion. Most glad to be wrong when provenMarket is and cannot be an egoistic ground because I care for profits more than ego and being right. Don‚Äôt know where I can encash ‚Äòbragging right‚ÄôWith respect to Vicplas medical segment seriously i have no idea exactly what they are producing  how much  to whom and where  projected growth  how much premium to command in times like this  their bargaining power  demand forecast etcIn an ideal world all info are available but then there won‚Äôt be extraordinary profits to be made when everything is knownEfficient market hypothesis?Your guess is as good as mine. Mine may be imperfect I will do a forecast and guesstimate. I got a number and when results is out  I will dissect it and see where I gone wrong and if very grossly wrong on the upside  it shows credibility of the company and underestimates by me and the marketThe differential in views is what makes the alpha / the extra pain where gone wrong.,btohqsg
bro  wow... u really can type such a long message within a few seconds...,btohqsg
How much PPE are they selling?How much did they pay for arrow medical?Existing owners have to writeoff debt to let Vicplas take overSelling ppe in times like this they have to writeoff to sellThey dumb or something?It may become a gem after restructuring and turnaround. For now it surely does notHear ppe all hyped up already.See UK hyped up once more.Definitely won‚Äôt appear in coming results. Already stated does not have any effect in the acquisition notice.,btohqsg
Bro just share info that not trying to prove a point or etc as there are too many news that perhaps may miss out or this also go to other counter as well. You are right on the report stated just that other information come late before the result made known,btohqsg
Errr not sureThey look dime a dozen generic products readily available in China and suchMaybe made in Singapore commands a premium. No idea,btohqsg
that is correct .. made in singapore is indeed a premium brand product with good quality and should command a premium price   esp in medical field  brand and quality are essential... thats how to differentiate the products/service from other countries...üòÑüëèüëè,btohqsg
Wow first time see so many ppl comment on VP... HAHAHA..,btohqsg
"""Test Kit Manufacturing:Forefront‚Äôs investment in cleanroom capacity and its manufacturing automation and qualitymanagement competencies made it a logical choice for commercialization of a test kit developed by acompany in Singapore. Automated equipment mixes and fills reagents in one clean room  while aseparate room is used to fill the positive controls in a biohazard safety cabinet. The reagents are thenpackaged into test kits and shipped.While the speed requirements of this project meant that Forefront Medical built its manufacturingsolution around specifications developed entirely by its customer  its regulatory team did support aconcurrent validation  registration and regulatory process""From their case study report",btohqsg
VP got growth. Next week see result.Got value.,btohqsg
Now market don't know see what...Good result also sell down,btohqsg
Tell me which stock can buy,btohqsg
It might be overvalue and that's y market sell down,btohqsg
Under value buy. Over value sell.,btohqsg
VP alot of people trapped high,btohqsg
I think from fy2018 till now will be more relevant for medical segment especially this yr 100% acquired arrow medical and produce new medical related stuff for covid 19 and with contracts secured,btohqsg
Now 0.34 almost 50% wipe off...Really no mercy,btohqsg
in vest based the fact not hope.,btohqsg
Note this have not add arrow medical into,btohqsg
Actually I see here ppl know how to count the EPsCount backwardU can assume VP can earn 30millions.30/500Slap a 12x pe is 70c.Can they earn 30millions?Then 74c can buy anot?,btohqsg
So isn't it over value sell and under value buy?,btohqsg
Closing of VP ..Also sell down..Next week maybe can see 2 series..,btohqsg
Vicplas results I think will not be spectacular due to drag from piping business. But with the new contracts and projects for medical devices  and the reopening of the construction sector  ya 2021 will be much better.,btohqsg
Will have a technical rebound. Now quite near to bottom,btohqsg
Notice a very heavy volume at closing matching for many counters  some up some dn. AEM eat up 2 to 3 pips  and SM throw dn with big volume. So VP not alone.,btohqsg
Nobody wants to hold over the weekend,btohqsg
