idk y but i still rmbr the day. 16 sept 2022üíÄ,btohqsg
this chat has gone from ns gc to tm gc,btohqsg
hmmmm see la who here was/in tmjc,btohqsg
i should have gone tm to join the legendary gang,btohqsg
meanwhile idk how to help myself coz I need to do work but I can‚Äôt seem to process anything,btohqsg
i oso got b4 in sec sch but it wasnt the good kind,btohqsg
Like it is me staring at my notes,btohqsg
There will always be someone at the bus stop,btohqsg
i been to mjc b4. for fking lockdown evacution drill,btohqsg
damn i oso want free ppr,btohqsg
But I took a long long break from 7-9.30,btohqsg
And I hv this weird ass friend,btohqsg
I tell him nothing is getting into my head,btohqsg
He reply ‚Äòwhat have u studied so far‚Äô,btohqsg
let's break down your notes into smaller chunk and revise 1 step at a time?,btohqsg
Maybe this helps a bit coz I hv been really unproductive and I can‚Äôt afford to screw up any more exams,btohqsg
Coz I think part of this lack of concentration is seeing there is a 65 pg slide,btohqsg
yeah like I find that whenever I try to revise and nothing goes in my head  i just tell myself ''ok let's just revise this 1 paragraph first and see how'',btohqsg
then paragraph after paragraph  divide and conquer,btohqsg
Know how to do the last qn,btohqsg
Cuz is Yeo li kwang set the paper,btohqsg
I send U when I get back,btohqsg
Have full mark for that one,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to do 2(a),btohqsg
4n¬≤ + 3n + n = 4 n¬≤ + 4nThen can factorise 4 out to 4 sigma ( blah blah),btohqsg
or break it into concepts. whenever i encounter like parts with a ton of slides  it's more digestable if i look through and see what are the diff sections  so instead of oh there's 65 slides  there's 10 concepts  etc,btohqsg
every time you finish one it's like 10% done,btohqsg
instead of thinking of 600+ days to ORD  i just take it as 2 years@chemcer,btohqsg
‚ÄúI understand that some may be concerned that they will have one less chance to improve their MTL (mother tongue language) grades ‚Äù said Mr Chan.‚ÄúBut we need to strike a careful balance between striving for excellence  chasing the last mark and allowing our students to learn at a better pace.‚Äù,btohqsg
Genuine question though  who benefits from taking o level mt twice anyway,btohqsg
From my understanding  the grades from the paper in june and then october for a person wont differ by much anyway,btohqsg
grades are not important after the next stage in life,btohqsg
i feel that taking it in may/june takes lesser toll on me,btohqsg
jus finish that one subj  get it done n over with,btohqsg
is 77kg as a 1.7m person considered fat (asking for a friend),btohqsg
depends on the body fat. I was 79kg as 1.7m and i was fatter than now even though now im around 83kg,btohqsg
on the heavier side but certainly not overweight,btohqsg
why leh ctk u 77kg and 1.7m ah,btohqsg
you need a smart electronic scale  the xiaomi one quite good,btohqsg
ok no one asked but did u know u can share word doc and edit concurrently with your grp mates,btohqsg
how can an electronic scale calculate body fat üíÄ,btohqsg
and tbh  you can tell by looking into the mirror also....,btohqsg
my cousin told me people count down as early as ns starts,btohqsg
as in looking at your friend,btohqsg
or ask you friend looks into the mirror himself,btohqsg
i started counting right after a level HAHAHAH,btohqsg
counting down when ur enlist jus gonna make u stress tho,btohqsg
weight itself doesn‚Äôt say a lot,btohqsg
