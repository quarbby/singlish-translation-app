so just H1 maths w double science not rly useful,btohqsg
Now my concern is Sec I only have two pure science but no amaths go JC can still go science stream take h2 science?,btohqsg
Iâ€™d say if u rly want to know call the JC up and ask ah,btohqsg
Some schools like icedmilo said dont allow h2 sci + h1 math,btohqsg
but i got see b4 ppl w that combi la,btohqsg
Just know that you'll be limited lor,btohqsg
So its nt a straightup no  but its possible ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Usually is h1 contrasting e.g. econs,btohqsg
Why would you drop H2 math though,btohqsg
Idk maybe because you wanna maximise ur chances of doing well?,btohqsg
What if my h2 math gets U and my Hw econs gets  A,btohqsg
"And continue getting 0/20 rp for h2 math just because its ""dang important ""?",btohqsg
impossible U for h2 math one,btohqsg
the j1 cohort 20smth percent got u for promos,btohqsg
i nvr said they were short,btohqsg
A levels got get u for H2 math?,btohqsg
Wow thatâ€™ll be a first for me,btohqsg
Besides... science course without H2 math cannot go to almost every engineering or science course in local university,btohqsg
A levels got u for everything la,btohqsg
The question is  would you rather have A for H2 Econs  or worse than A for maths  say C for H2 Maths,btohqsg
Out of all the subjects at least,btohqsg
As long as u put in consistent effort and practice,btohqsg
It should not be a problem,btohqsg
And dropping to H1 maths may not be helpful if u are worse with stats but still bad at pure math,btohqsg
I didn't do a single tutorial and still got A comfortably,btohqsg
Not saying you should be like me but yeah,btohqsg
Well russians no need to do tutorials anyways so....Look at ozzy man,btohqsg
Different people have different strengths  so itâ€™s only rational to play to your own strength,btohqsg
