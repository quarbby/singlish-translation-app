Most scholars that I heard of who remain after their bonds are assigned to government sectors,btohqsg

I kept some of them some I just throw the rest I sold,btohqsg
I used them to wipe my ass after I shit,btohqsg
Do you still keep your FMath notes and tutorials ?,btohqsg
I find some of it useful in uni mathematics cause things like euler method trapezium rule newton raphson method cylindrical shells etc have came out in my uni math syllabus so far,btohqsg
and I find it less complicated and easier to understand compared to the lecture notes the uni gave us,btohqsg
Yes. Most important is Linear Algebra and DE actually,btohqsg
yes I think I will be learning that in later parts of the course this is just y1t1,btohqsg
no i hv shit since pri sch but im throwing all away,btohqsg
Ya idk why tf my parents keep until now,btohqsg
it's not like we can ask the top 1% of earners to do the things we want them to. they won't. so we start small  start with change that is easy. you can't expect anyone to change their ways overnight anyways.,btohqsg
but the other 'modern consumerism dressed up as environmenalism',btohqsg
jst based on that comment hahs,btohqsg
Which nut doesn‚Äôt belong to the family of nuts?,btohqsg
that's true. people do think they are doing more than they are. they see it as a very big change on their part. so when asked-what have you been doing for our environment? they say: oh I've been using metal straws. but does that really create alot of positive impacts to the environment? i doubt so. so i think it's extremely important to educate others on how much more they should be doing if they truly want to help the environment. so many businesses have used commercial tactics such as oh buy metal straws and you can save turtles. yes it helps  but to what extent?,btohqsg
It is a cashew and cashew is not a nut,btohqsg
how do you stop seeing these xxx join grouo,btohqsg

I‚Äôm scared for literature and combined science,btohqsg
Ultimately it‚Äôs tertiary education that matters,btohqsg
Honestly I forgot about Os already lmao,btohqsg
If you go for scholarships the most important credentials is the tertiary education record,btohqsg
I just know I messed up,btohqsg
I guess when you have no hope to begin with  you get over it faster,btohqsg

Education is just a stepping stone to success ba,btohqsg

u wont know how they mark and wtv,btohqsg
hii can anyone recommend which telco for home broad bane fiber is worth signing up for?,btohqsg
I use M1 broadband for good balance of price vs speed. Pure internet. About $30/mth. 600 Mbps. If you're a gamer... there's MyRepublic. I don't use cable tv  so pairing with XXX free channels is redundant  like what Starhub and Singtel like to do. Also... do research for your area  for which has the most stable connection..for example  friends and students in Bukit Panjang commonly complain about connectivity or slow connections with the local red-logo company.,btohqsg
I tot 500Mbps? Most times maybe lower than that,btohqsg
If u just surf internet for news  check emails  occasionally watch YouTube or very little livestreaming  then get a sim card with a router. Maybe tpg,btohqsg
fuck orbit banned on discord then come here,btohqsg
What's the difference between current account and savings account?,btohqsg
I'm trying to apply for the edusave thing but I dont know which option I shd choose,btohqsg
so lame you lit rally copied this joke and posted it in discord,btohqsg
I am googling it and from what I see from it  savings is more of a personal one while current is for large transactions happening a lot.,btohqsg
call me out on discord noob,btohqsg
Aron got a bank account right I think it will state it on the first page of the book,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I think some bank employee told me my account was not savings account so I'm confused,btohqsg
Anyone here received a letter regarding Edusave awards ?,btohqsg
Hi guys can i collect o level results with piercing (I'm a dude),btohqsg
I think it depends on your school  some schools still follow their strict rules like mine,btohqsg
Idk but it wasnt a savings or current account,btohqsg
From young ur parents might have opened a trust account for u,btohqsg
Hi is anyone from Nus USP? What did yall write for the application ah,btohqsg
Hi guys  is it worth to join a cca in uni,btohqsg
I would say at the very least join one,btohqsg
I think it makes your uni life more enriching at the very least if you have a cca,btohqsg
my 500mb/s regularly goes above 500,btohqsg

Some of my friends received alr,btohqsg
honestly circles not that value anymore,btohqsg
If someone‚Äôs L1R5 is more than 15  will they be considered top 25% of the cohort?,btohqsg
its depends on how their schoolmate did their prelims,btohqsg
I think they look at the overall percentage for prelim instead of L1R5But it depends on the sch avg performance,btohqsg
Do u think it may be top 25%?,btohqsg
I got unlimted data for $18 but its awhile back alr,btohqsg
like i said bfr ut depends on how ur schoolmate perform for prelims,btohqsg
but if u get before 13 dec then it probably means u got it alr,btohqsg
if after then i guess lower chance,btohqsg
My overall percentage for 7 subjects was 66,btohqsg
How do u know u qualify for it in the first place?,btohqsg
Except u are missing one thing,btohqsg
U are assuming they will reply to u in the first place,btohqsg
Kinda awkward to ask such a q if u ask me,btohqsg
my l1r5 is 17?? and im alr top 25% lol,btohqsg
i have a feeling it's by percentage,btohqsg
because my c5 and b4 were just 1 percent away from the next grade but idk i guess,btohqsg
My newfound understanding of h2 phycis calls it bs,btohqsg
Unless its some h3 shit idk yet,btohqsg
dialing CID we found an imposter,btohqsg
Shdn't be a surprise since u hate it,btohqsg
You stay near wild wild wet,btohqsg
But fr anyone does stocks here,btohqsg
Oh I think they sent wrong person then,btohqsg
What makes u thing u the wrong guy then,btohqsg
I'm late for most of my cca sessions and I pon a lot.,btohqsg
But then I skipped a lot of performance,btohqsg
i also skip a lot and got another award,btohqsg
So expensive. Any plan less than 10 bucks but 100GB data?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs crazy cheapUnder my current plan if I want 1GB data for 28 days is alr $11,btohqsg
Anyone got lobang can jio haha,btohqsg
the closest you'll get it TPG's $10 for 50gb lol,btohqsg
no pls dont my data dies frequently,btohqsg
Is there a market in singapore,btohqsg
a tiktoker went to psa and got a card graded for 10 and he got that card for $45. From that he made a $900 profit,btohqsg
also what card important  if charizard and one of the first one psa grade 10 will go from tens of thousands easily,btohqsg
I was watching a few streamers just now and they ranged from like $400 to a few thousand,btohqsg
He pulled a holo charizard but people are saying its psa 9,btohqsg
Yeah there was something on the top left on the back they said,btohqsg
Psa 10 and psa 9 price tag difference very large haha,btohqsg
i think that thing is condition,btohqsg
got a card have like 50+ psa 10 only and maybe 100-200 psa 9,btohqsg
Does nintendo intentionally make psa 9 and 10,btohqsg
Or are quality differences on accident,btohqsg
got all that factory thingy and the cards made are not perfect,btohqsg
I got follow a pokemon channel and shit  charizard is often more expensive,btohqsg
I thought mewtwo or smtg would be more expensive,btohqsg
Cause i assumrd its more rare,btohqsg
But i guess people just like charizard,btohqsg
Is mew in any of the boxes,btohqsg
maybe lah got some pack will have it as special card or what,btohqsg
Was mew even considered gen 1 i think he wasnt added till layer right,btohqsg
Will be ex in the future,btohqsg
got a lot of packs in the world go for a lot of money,btohqsg
Would make sense to buy boxes or packs and just wait,btohqsg
will go from $5 to $500 or $1000,btohqsg
ya got people really try that,btohqsg
and if that pack rare right might go for a lot too,btohqsg
I guess its a risk if they open it they may make more money than if they sell it,btohqsg
What would you do if like in the future you have 1 pack it would sell few hundred,btohqsg
But also got chance of few thousand,btohqsg
Honestly ill just cash out like risky if you open,btohqsg
i buy/sell vanguard tcg cards for similar reasons,btohqsg
Yeah this be looking like the ones they opened on stream,btohqsg
got a logan paul stream for charity and 1 pack 20k or something i forgot,btohqsg
ya he got a lot of it and sold away,btohqsg
This week on twitch a few streamers doing pokemon week,btohqsg
to all rich people and gave all profit to charity again,btohqsg
Never thought id be interested in watching people open pokemon cards,btohqsg
Card resellers earn more than pokemon tcg pros haha,btohqsg
Hmm investing in like gen 2 or gen 3 now seems good,btohqsg
an investor i followed on youtube spent 20k on a pack haha,btohqsg
Cause the return time is nearer,btohqsg
I open boxes and resell the singles i get,btohqsg
Have you been positive or negative so far,btohqsg
Abt 10-15% profit on the total amount i spend i guess,btohqsg
Positive for sure  or else wont be doing it anymore lol,btohqsg
Got a gyarados holo from it,btohqsg
How much do those go for,btohqsg
I know the starters are ex,btohqsg
idk leh his one is from a rare pack too,btohqsg
And like nido holo is the worse i think,btohqsg
idk he never go test it,btohqsg
psa test need like 10 at once or they will not test XD,btohqsg
Some streamers they estimate on the spot,btohqsg
Or have like people to check the stream,btohqsg
ya that one 1st edition gyarados,btohqsg
Real estate investor is a nice word for pokemon,btohqsg
that man got a lot of real estate haha,btohqsg
I think friday pokimane is doing her box,btohqsg
F for the streamer who got psa 9 holo char,btohqsg
Got a man got a extremely rare card from a pack and accidentally bent it and it had a mark,btohqsg
Do you think these cards reached peak value now,btohqsg
that thing will only go and get more expensive,btohqsg
If it was already psa 9 i guess its alright,btohqsg
that man was like there better not have anything good hiding,btohqsg
But f man if its 10,btohqsg
and he got that card hahahaha,btohqsg
What was its psa 10 pricd,btohqsg
however if got psa 10 min 20k,btohqsg
But i guess its still a few hundre,btohqsg
But imagine if its a holo starter,btohqsg
rainbow rare VMAX version of Pikachu worth up to $1 500 depending on the grade.,btohqsg
Yeah the streamers bought 20-30k each,btohqsg
Do you actually have to declare pokemon cards in taxes haha,btohqsg
Cause if im not wrong you need to declare stocks or investments right,btohqsg
Do you personally have any cards,btohqsg
I just found out about it today so i dont,btohqsg
i only know pokemon exist at 10 or something hahaha,btohqsg
Wait why arent people afraid of counterfieting though,btohqsg
Is it that hard to counterfiet,btohqsg
I only know at sec sch cause of pogo,btohqsg
a lot of people only go with psa graded one as psa very reliable haha,btohqsg
wah dr hang life really hard man i saw it today and wow,btohqsg
that man only went to school with government bursaries and aid or else he have to work,btohqsg
parent pay not able to afford that many children and ya,btohqsg
I think im also missing context,btohqsg
dr hang family too poor to afford school for every child so he had to rely on government aid and bursaries to pay for it,btohqsg
got a newspaper and he got an award and he told that story in it,btohqsg
ya that is why dr hang probably got so far like if 1 year he slip never get that award then gg,btohqsg
But ignoring his past i cant say he does a lot of noticable work as a principal,btohqsg
But none that the gen student pop can see,btohqsg
I have never talked to him in real life man,btohqsg
Ive talked to him once or twice,btohqsg
that man had dedicated his entire life to math only,btohqsg
For some people yhey change the vowel,btohqsg
Hi is circles live or whatever that‚Äôs called reliable and good,btohqsg
have yall listened to positions album,btohqsg
