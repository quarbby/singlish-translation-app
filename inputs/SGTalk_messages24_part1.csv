"A lady and her 7-year-old son are eating in a restaurant.In a moment of playfulness  the boy swallows a coin and chokes. The mother tries slapping his back  rubbing his neck  shaking him hard and everything she could think of  without success.The boy begins to turn blue. The desperate mother starts screaming for help.A man gets up from a nearby table  and with astonishing tranquility  without saying a word  lowers the boy's pants and squeezes his testicles.The boy yells and spits out the coin. The gentleman with the same tranquility returns to his table without a word.Soon  the mother calms down and approaches the gentleman to thank him for saving her son's life.She asks  ""Sir  are you a doctor?""""No  ma'am "" comes the reply. ""I'm an Assistant Commissioner of the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore.""""We are trained to squeeze everyone's balls to make them cough up the last penny.""Gentle Reminder:============Please file your income tax returns by 15th April or by e-filing on 18th April latest.",btohqsg
