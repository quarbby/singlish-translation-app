… what about alfa romeo and bmw e30…?,btohqsg
what did the guy do? put a larger battery?,btohqsg
Also what helps EVs go faster is not a bigger battery but the number of motors and how good they are,btohqsg
Bigger batteries come with the package just to make sure the car is still practical,btohqsg
There's a Giulia GTA M at the Alfa dealer in Singapore this week!,btohqsg
Not that simple is also how much torque the car lost on the wheels,btohqsg
A lot of 0-100 so call 3 second are slow as lose a lot of torque,btohqsg
Agreed but that is common for all cars,btohqsg
this is a given. no need to educate here. there is only a maximum number of  motors you can put. and after that ??? 😉,btohqsg
I was referring more to what specifically changes for EVs,btohqsg
can put 8 motors mr arnav?,btohqsg
Tesla is so fast when launch is because they managed to lose lesser torque,btohqsg
Because there is torque loss based on tires  surface  tire temp  etc. etc. Due to many reasons,btohqsg
Not only these also how the computer distribute the torque,btohqsg
Actually more than the torque loss  Tesla has instant torque on launch unlike ICE cars which need to reach a certain powerband  hence the instant launch,btohqsg
Other ev also is instant torque,btohqsg
Power delivery is limited to change driving experience  all not going for fastest 0-60,btohqsg
yes but some love tesla brutal acceleration,btohqsg
