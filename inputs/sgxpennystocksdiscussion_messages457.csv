Keppel  Sembcorp Marine request trading halts1. Keppel Corporation and rig builder Sembcorp Marine (Sembmarine) on Thursday morning (June 24) requested in separate filings to the Singapore Exchange for a halt in the trading of their shares pending announcements.2. Keppel announced in January it was exiting the rig business as its offshore and marine unit pivots to clean energy  following a strategic review.3. Keppel Offshore & Marine (O&M) would stop building offshore oil drilling platforms  after the oil price crash saw it post record losses of $1.19 billion last year.4. Sembmarine  meanwhile  was recently fully demerged from its parent  Sembcorp Industries. Temasek  which is the biggest shareholder in Keppel and Sembmarine  dropped its plan last year to take a controlling stake in Keppel  following the company's poor financial results.5. Temasek's role in making a partial offer for Keppel and moving to directly own a stake in Sembmarine had been viewed by many analysts as critical for a consolidation of the struggling O&M sector.Source link in headerMore here,btohqsg

Recap for Amos Group (previously known as Gaylin)Gaylin has issued 1.36 billion new ordinary shares equivalent to a 75.64 per cent stake in it to PeakBayoi at S$0.05 each aggregating to $68 million  ... Asia-​focused PE fund manager ShawKwei & Partnershttps://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/peakbayou-acquires-majority-stake-in-singapore-listed-gaylin-for-s68m- The recent rights issue was $0.0135 which brings the PE Firm (ShawKwei & Partners) investment average to $0.03175.The recent issuance of new rights shares brings liquidity to this counter and gave Amos Group its 'heart beat.' SSH Danny Lien selling off his shares recently  but there were players absorbing his selling at $0.022/$0.023. This is a positive sign for the counter as market makers looks to have taken interest in this counter.Amos Group is in the O&G Sector and this this one will be getting more interesting IMO. Good to watchlist this one  I expect more play coming in once they have finished the flushing. $0.018 looks a really cheap price to collect this one. DYODD.,btohqsg
