Hi anyone looking to rent cars from 23 - 25 afternoon do pm me,btohqsg
let the 1.2k members benefit too,btohqsg
Yes I'm a red bull fan,btohqsg
I have a feeling Hamilton might get the 8th world tittle unless max can stop him,btohqsg
we won't know until it happens,btohqsg
heard the astons have good straight line  mclaren are hiding their floor  merc are hiding their rear,btohqsg
redbull havent shown the car at all too,btohqsg
Aston had decent cornering last time  good straight line could make em a surprise package,btohqsg
i think the midfield would be tight,btohqsg
then again  we won't know until lights out,btohqsg
hoping that aston pull a shocker,btohqsg
Hope it's tight at the top too,btohqsg
haas would likely drown in itself,btohqsg
Alonso gonna cook  I hv a feeling,btohqsg
knowing how awful gunther manages the team,btohqsg
Haas shud liquidate the team lmao  they going nowhere with Steiner,btohqsg
how they are still afloat is a miracle,btohqsg
hulkenburg is wayy past his prime,btohqsg
the fact they lost mick is hilarious,btohqsg
He was never gonna make a career there,btohqsg
they lost him to mercedes LOL,btohqsg
Toto will sort a seat for him,btohqsg
which in turn guarantees a good career,btohqsg
when he took the gap year,btohqsg
More importantly Ferrari lost him ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
ferrari had no future with him tbh,btohqsg
people expect him to be like michael,btohqsg
He defo better than many on the grid atm,btohqsg
arguably he won his F2 title with consistency,btohqsg
but to some extent i agree,btohqsg
Coming back to Aston  imagine it's as competitive as RP 2020,btohqsg
but don't forget that alpine and mclaren have a fighting chance too,btohqsg
Really can't judge McLaren  no clues where they will be this yr,btohqsg
but zak brown should be in the bin,btohqsg
That colour nice sia. Even nicer with duckbill spoiler üòè,btohqsg
haisss can‚Äôt spell mclaren without L,btohqsg
bro i jst opened ig you telling me aston martin instantly died aft test session started üò≠,btohqsg

ok but actually@dozuni curious on how u did the first part,btohqsg
where u learn all this skills?,btohqsg
bro is still new and films better and edit bttr thn most spotters out there   keep it up bro !,btohqsg
hope you get more recognition in the future !,btohqsg
so much better than some accounts that push their crappy content out to every chat,btohqsg
with awful color grading and saturation cranked up to 100,btohqsg
HAHAH and then has his own ‚Äúteam‚Äù and sends abt how he closed it down and reopened it,btohqsg
wait what am i missing out,btohqsg
proceeds to then leave the groupchat  and then rejoin every groupchat later in 4 days and acts as though nothing happens,btohqsg
anyone of uall saw the F1 testing session,btohqsg
