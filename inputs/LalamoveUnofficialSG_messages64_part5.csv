Yeah i donâ€™t understand their stacking means,btohqsg
For me over the weekend fri i stack 6 615 630 sat i stack 7 715..wait for sms ..i weekend warrior,btohqsg
Pick up 2 orders at 5.30 from same store  deliver the 2nd order on 6.30. Why late for 20 mins? Thought the delivery time is 1 hr.,btohqsg
Did u click the delivered button 20min later,btohqsg
some oddle food delivery is collection 530pm. then delivery timing is 545 to 615pm only. Especially food at sultan area (Malay food),btohqsg
same I also stack 5 515 530,btohqsg
Or it could be click the arrive n loading complete late by 20mins,btohqsg
No  I completed the 2nd order at 6.30 sharp,btohqsg
Pick up time is 5.30 for both orders at the same restaurant.,btohqsg
Don't understand why llm need to be hard on its driver. Without llm driver. They can tahan meh,btohqsg
Note stated deliver between 6 to 7pm,btohqsg
Pickup 530  1.5 hrs to deliver?,btohqsg
Yes  the first order delivered before 6 and customer ask why so early. Told them I deliver only,btohqsg
If base on LLM SOP 55mins..Some oddle orders is 45-55mins..Most of the time is 1 hour..dont think all oddles order time are the same,btohqsg
Oddles got 2 timing so far for me,btohqsg
Once llm start to implement penalty  we can close our accounts,btohqsg
If they want us take jobs more than 30min apart. Meaning 45 min. They can set in their software to refrain us from taking. Sure a lot will accidenttaly bid within 30min.,btohqsg
Cause they wan suspend u then eat ur $75 ma,btohqsg
Well old app can do that. New app they allow stacking. Now suddenly give us warning  dunno wtf they want,btohqsg
Maybe they wan get rid some ppl... Since they got a lot monk little porridge.,btohqsg
Invite the ceo into the chat lol,btohqsg
Rider n driver job not easy,btohqsg
Customer take motor but item not motor item,btohqsg
keep seeing like 7-10 stops for $30-$40,btohqsg
Lai see how walker completed the job 55min,btohqsg
U have to spend at least 15 min for pick up n drop off,btohqsg
Plus the journey maybe around 15mins,btohqsg
So 1 job around 30 mins,btohqsg
If kenot stack  really hard liao,btohqsg
Do gf lor. No need stack aso Cho buay wanðŸ¤£,btohqsg
For those full time llm jialat  but so far van orders still ok,btohqsg
Van aso no need stack . They one job ba ba Liao,btohqsg
guys dont mind me asking  how much on average you all earn a day doing lalamove?,btohqsg
Hard to search :( so I thought to ask,btohqsg
just wrote to LLM to clarify their policy on stacking,btohqsg
but i agree that if their policy don't allow stacking.. then it shouldn't be even allowed on their app..,btohqsg
Sometimes bid job how to see so details,btohqsg
Cannot see location properly aready might be gone. How to see timing until so Zhun. .. think they really want suspend some drivers... If not all die together sharing this small pie.,btohqsg
actually i think the app can stack is because they are allowing themselve a lifeline when orders are at its peak and not enough drivers..,btohqsg
When demand more than supply  they need more drivers,btohqsg
When supply more then demand  they have to micromanage,btohqsg
so now more drivers than orders.. so they are nip picking on this..,btohqsg
but then again  which means to say they suka suka do things as they wish.. there is no standard policy,btohqsg
heng i do weekends n off days only.,btohqsg
so i gona test system again this weekend..,btohqsg
But now u need double the time to earn the same amount,btohqsg
yea so i will continue to stack on weekends,btohqsg
Llm really don't have a proper protocol. Suka suka change rules here and there till everyone tao gong gong.,btohqsg
i won't care.. until they send me sms or email.. then i will roast them 9696,btohqsg
Yes me too cos already took advance and not going to cancel. Just do it and if they want suspend also bobian. Take it as take a break,btohqsg
