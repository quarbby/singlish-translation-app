Bro you aim 3k enough already,btohqsg
Don’t be so ambitious right now,btohqsg
I doing lalamove part time also  drive from 4-7/8 I earn 70-100 depending on what kind of day I have,btohqsg
I HIGHLY suggest you do the same right now,btohqsg
My workplace here if Got OT I monthly also abt 3k but the OT mean no sleep must work day and night,btohqsg
Really drastic would be yeah  to change jobs and get whatever jobs you can that can help to pay off the monthly loans easier. Freelancing jobs usually may pay more but you really gotta work hard,btohqsg
It is a painful lesson you’ve learned,btohqsg
Ya thts y I regard buying a car,btohqsg
Everything can work out if you willing to put in the effort,btohqsg
Talk to someone too if you’re too stressed out,btohqsg
Got alot of outlet online to help with your stress,btohqsg
6-7k is probably like the top 0.5%,btohqsg
I don't want to have hit other people car anymore,btohqsg
it’s possible but highly unrealistic too,btohqsg
Cuz tht time not enough sleep then driving lorry then hit people car end up I have to pay also,btohqsg
Now I scared driving on road also tbh,btohqsg
After the accident happen I drive more slwoer then other people cuz I had a fear when seeing people car flashing the rear red light,btohqsg
i think u can try not driving for awhile and take public transport,btohqsg
and if u got season parking  parking will not be an issue,btohqsg
But I don't want waste the money on paying this few month and left the car in the carpark,btohqsg
Rather than you drive and pour money on petrol and cashcard,btohqsg
U save on expenses on the car bro,btohqsg
that’s alm 400 a month leh,btohqsg
400 a month could be very helpful,btohqsg
The more you drive the more wear and tear gonna happen,btohqsg
Consession also only 1xx per month,btohqsg
I forgot exactly for adult how much,btohqsg
letting go of some creature comforts,btohqsg
Pls I want sell off my car hope someone can buy my car even at 57k I'm ok I can't try ask my friend to lend me abit money to top up,btohqsg
it’ll only make the situation worst,btohqsg
Bro you beg on your knees also if noone Interested also wont buy,btohqsg
Now you need to sacrifice time,btohqsg
Bro we r helping u n giving u suggestions. If u dont take our advice and put it into action  no one is gonna help u. Only u can help urself,btohqsg
You gotta start thinking objectively now. Fuel  parking  ERP  you gotta pay everything once the car is running on the road. Whatever you’ve already paid for like season parking  don’t think about it and don’t spend any further in other to make it “worth your while”. Cut your expenses and losses and keep your focus on the monthly instalments at the moment until you get to sell the car.,btohqsg
Tht time cuz of part time job I tahan for 2 week then I got into accident,btohqsg
Do other part time job that doesnt require driving,btohqsg
But my full time job required me to drive,btohqsg
Parcel delivery full time can earn money also,btohqsg
Now no need to think about cpf contribution,btohqsg
I want buy I need get rid of this car first cuz sending parcel they have van,btohqsg
borrow someone bicycle do grabfood also can make decent money without driving,btohqsg
Look into other full time jobs,btohqsg
Bro got some can accept cars,btohqsg
Try to combine jobs that you can do with less rest and sleep,btohqsg
Worst comes to worst  get a new job. If you can get something flexible and works for you  go for it. If a job allows you more time to do some part time work  look into that. Explore your options seriously. Don’t brush it off and really look into it,btohqsg
I did but they want the study cer,btohqsg
Car is not easy to sell and get rid of.U have to make do of the current situation n make the best out of it while waiting,btohqsg
Forget about the car because there's not much you can do with it  just leave it in a parking spot and try to pay it off while you wait to sell it,btohqsg
They don’t look at cert  i think,btohqsg
Bubble tea shop also got $7-10/hr. Confirm no need cert in making bubble tea,btohqsg
