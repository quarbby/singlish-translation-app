Hi Chris  for Revolut 20% cashback promo for MRT rides  understand from their terms and conditions that need to transfer $100 via bank transfer each month to enjoy the 20% cashback for that month.Do you know if I still can qualify for the cashback if at the end of the month I withdraw all the money inside the Revolut account? Then the next month transfer $100 again‚Ä¶and repeat this cycle till December since the promotion is running till 31st Dec 2021.,btohqsg
Hi Sandy  yes you can do that. I think many people are doing that,btohqsg
Just keep enough for Simplygo deduction,btohqsg

Hi all  any idea why I can‚Äôt see the bank details on Revolut app for top up via bank transfer?,btohqsg
Is the account number my Revolut card number?,btohqsg
Revolut homepage > add money > change to bank transfer,btohqsg
I clicked that and showing the same detail. No account number,btohqsg
Another way is click your on your name at top left Revolut homepage > documents > account confirmation,btohqsg
Use the one with DBS Account number,btohqsg

Chris  would u recommend the hsbc revolution card?,btohqsg
Yes  it is on par with UOB PPV at 4mpd.But I'm not so into miles accumulation now due to travel restrictions,btohqsg
It‚Äôs also able to earn reward points to offset spending. Do u think the 10x reward points is more value as compared with mainstream cash back cards? 1 thing that attracts me to the card is the no annual fee,btohqsg
In ny opinion  10x reward points are most optimized to redeem for Miles for the best value. Redeeming it for anything else e.g. cash  vouchers will just diminish its value and will be better if you just use a 5%/6% cashback card.,btohqsg
Hi Chris  thank you for sharing ! For the 4 Aug expiry is it for the sign up bonus or the 20% cashback? Any idea when the cashback will last... Cuz i cant seem to find a page on it ^^,btohqsg

Hi guys  just want some opinions or ideas on how to save up for a HDB for a single by 35 (currently 26)? Would a voluntary CPF contribution top up be better because some of it goes into OA  or would taking a housing loan and topping up into SA be better?Also  if you have any other interesting approaches  do let me know as well! Thanks!,btohqsg
Personal opinion:Would not go for voluntary topupDepends if you do your own investments such as ETFs.Take a housing loan (1.5% interest expense)  have a huge CPF SA balance (4% interest income). Then use your cash/cpf oa to pay down your mortgage,btohqsg
Hi all  I'm foreigner and new to Singapore. I have watched Chris' videos on credit cards and I'd like to apply one. Do I need to wait several months to let the bank have my salary records  or am I be eligible to apply it now? Thanks!,btohqsg
(of course  I want a higher credit lineüòÜ,btohqsg
The benchmark is 3 months of payslip  but no harm trying!Bank would usually give you 4x monthly salary of credit limit,btohqsg
Oh oh  that's a bit longüò¢ Thanks for replying,btohqsg
So before that  do you have advice on Debit cards?,btohqsg
Go for Grabpay Mastercard. It's a prepaid card so you can top up in the Grab Superapp  which is really useful in Singapore,btohqsg

aha  and maybe you can also have a video on how to choose a brokerüòè,btohqsg
I just bought my Coffee for $0.60!And got free $5 after topping up and making my first QR payment via Nestia app.Get $0.50 off if you make QR code payment in hawker centres via Nestia appFree $5 credited when you make your first Nestia payment!Use my referral link for 800 bonus points!https://topic.nestia.com/invite/100009118461,btohqsg
the problem is  many hawker centers are cash-onlyüò©,btohqsg
Yeah true. I have two hawker centres nearby. One has many QR merchants  the other has barely less than 10.,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/PGPaJVAewhcAre you trying to start your investment journey  but have not made the first step because you don‚Äôt know which Stock broker to choose?Then you have to watch this video because I will share my own personal experience with the brokers I have used beforeAnd review the good and bad about each broker  so that you don‚Äôt have to!,btohqsg
seems that there's something called platform fee for Moomoo trading in US stocks,btohqsg
If I understand it correctly  $0.0049/share for commission fee and $0.005/share for platform fee  that's almost the same as Tiger's $0.01 commission fee?,btohqsg
üò¢ actually  I just referred to Tiger's website  and realized that Tiger's $0.01 is also composed of $0.05 and $0.05... no problem now,btohqsg
üòÜ so they are really offering similar things  I would just choose one of them randomly,btohqsg
Yes  they both are rather identical on US Trade commissions,btohqsg
Just good for sign up bonuses,btohqsg
true  and I just signed up Tiger with your referral linkü§£,btohqsg
Thank you  and for the broken link reminder too!,btohqsg
no problem! I really like your videos  really helpful for me as a new-comer to SingaporeüòÜ,btohqsg
Ultimately  in the long term  just go with IBKR. These platforms like MooMoo  Tiger  not sure how long they can sustain with their aggressive promos.,btohqsg
yeah... but the share of AAPL is really inviting,btohqsg
the same country Moomoo and Tiger are from :),btohqsg
Cool üòé enjoy your time here!While i churn out more content üòÇ,btohqsg
ü§î Just out of curiosity  another Youtuber I follow  Kelvin  also made a video on brokers today. Is it a coincidence or any reason behind?,btohqsg
ü§£ ok  just found it interesting,btohqsg
Yeah its good also  so my videos get suggested on his feed also,btohqsg

Hi Chris  do you use it during pre-peak timing? Are you able to get the pre-peak discount on your Revolut card?,btohqsg
Yes  I got $0.50 off for tapping in before 7.45am in MRT,btohqsg
They deduct it immediately or the discount is rebated at the end of the month?,btohqsg
Immediately  just like how normal ez link works,btohqsg
Shit man. I think my fares are not discounted and I am still unable to link my Revolut card to the TL SimplyGo app,btohqsg
Anyway  those who signed up Revolut using my link but haven't fulfilled the conditions for $15 (add money  make 3 payments)  please do so within 24h or the offer will expire!,btohqsg
It's for MRT only  bus not included and should be automatic,btohqsg
Yes. I took it for MRT but wasn‚Äôt discounted. I confirmed a few times already,btohqsg
Hard to track if not on Simplygo app. Anyway if i were you then i would just use normal card to pay just so i get $0.50 for non peak morning  first. Then evening trip back use revolut,btohqsg
Hi Chris  do you think credit score is important in sg? I know it's important overseas in countries like US but I haven't heard much about its use in the sg context.,btohqsg
Not an expert on this but I generally feel it is not a big emphasis on SG  like even if you are HH  it will recover some day to at least a CC when you paid up. Unless you are perpetually a bad debt individual,btohqsg
Fun fact i was HH at one point  the lowest credit score in Singapore,btohqsg
I probably had too many cards at that point and CBS doesn't like it,btohqsg
So credit scores aren't looked at even if u wanna take a housing loan?,btohqsg
It is important for bank loan  not so much for HDB loan,btohqsg
Yeah  hdb loan only cares if you have regular income and sufficient cpf oa balance to pay the mortgage,btohqsg
true  I also wonder whether credit cards are commonly used in SG,btohqsg
More common now than 5 years ago. But QR payments is growing even faster!Some places (small provision shops) still don't credit card accept though,btohqsg
I noticed something weird: many shops do have POS machines  but they claim to accept only cash and NETS payment  not visa and master cards,btohqsg
Is there any reason for that? just wodnering,btohqsg
hmmm  those shops nearby my home don't accept QR payments though,btohqsg
Visa/mc charges merchant fee about 3%. So they want to save cost,btohqsg
üò¢ that makes sense... and that's also the reason why AMEX is so unpopular,btohqsg
Yep the merchant fee for Amex is also higher then Visa/MC,btohqsg
Generally large merchants are okay with the fees because credit cards can also attract card users (also travellers) to spend there.But now QR payment is already close to zero fees (for now)  so i believe merchants should at least have Paynow QR to really just move to digitization,btohqsg
Hey guys  do you guys rather buy dividend stocks on CDP linked brokerages or custodian brokers? Thanks,btohqsg
For me  I buy on whatever platform that has the cheapest fees :),btohqsg
So if custodian brokers is the cheapest  will buy from there?,btohqsg
but for beginners like me  I think Tiger and Moomoo are easier to useüòÜ,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone knows whether topping up Grab wallet is counted for the minimum spending requirement of credit cards?ü§î,btohqsg
Yes for some  like DBS Live fresh,btohqsg
Not all works  usually ownself try then will know,btohqsg
after reading through its T&C  I think GrabPay top-up is qualified for the minimum spending  but definitely not for the cashbacküòÇ,btohqsg
so Chris you are right in your previous videos  that the best idea is to have an un-limited cashback card for GrabPayü§£,btohqsg
Amex tcb and uob absolute qualifies for grabpay cash back. (have only tried Amex though and it works) ~,btohqsg
Yes  its quite important for live fresh though  when you are unable to hit $600 spending. Then just top up Grabpay to hit it,btohqsg
Yes these two are eligible  as mentioned in my earlier cashback card videos,btohqsg
I applied for Citi Cashback +  just because it's a master card instead of AMEXü§£,btohqsg
Anyone intending to apply for DBS card as new customer  please wait awhile for my Monday (Aug 9) video  will have a $300 signup promo,btohqsg

Just watched the video üòá. I dont have cpf / srs to invest . Just invested cash in endowus last week .Need some advice !! Pls@ChrisHMSGI was investing in Syfe since dec 2020  Reits & equity100  .Is it a wiser choice to stick to one robo & park most of the money into one portfolio    Or    Can Do both sides Endowus (Cash) +  Syfe REITS .,btohqsg
It is okay to have multiple robo advisors as long as you can keep track of them. I am also using both Endowus and Syfe now,btohqsg
Is there anyway I can TCB Amex to top up dash?,btohqsg
Tcb - grab - revolut - dash,btohqsg
Though I wouldn't do it for the effort,btohqsg
Will grab to revolut move the power up challenge tracker? If it does  then it might be a little worth it,btohqsg
How will preferential offering works on a custodian broker? Will we still be able to subscribe for excess?,btohqsg
Yes  still can. I talked about it in my brokerage videohttps://youtu.be/PGPaJVAewhc,btohqsg

Hi Chris  do you know whether Citi SMRT works with favepay for the 5% cashback?,btohqsg
I thought it would  but I didnt get it for favepay,btohqsg
Weird considering Citi Rewards work for favepay,btohqsg
Yeah i had the same assumption.End up didn't qualify for the monthly $500 min spend for cashback,btohqsg
Someone else tested before? Haha because if never hit 500 min spend wouldn't know.Thought could use it for big furniture purchases since Gain City takes favepay payments,btohqsg
I was trying to buy some BYJ (a REITs ETF) with Tiger Broker  but my orders were immediately cancelled saying 'the product is currently unavailable'. Anybody knows why?,btohqsg
I guess it's still open to trade  but its transaction history looks a bit weird to me,btohqsg
Hi Guys  just wondering if there's any Credit Card expert here ü§£ So  the thing is  I am about to make  a ring purchase for my proposal and I am not sure what Credit Card can give me the best cashback? I don't spend a lot every month  at least not for now until I have to start paying for renovation  wedding dinner etc. But what will be a good all rounder card such that you can even pay your insurance  electricity bills  town council payment etc? BTW  the ring cost $7 000  but I am paying by installments.I have the Citi 1.6% and Standard Chartered 1.5%  but I find that I want to up my game a little bit and also considering a higher cashback value?,btohqsg
When I mean I don't spend a lot  it's usually below $500.,btohqsg
Not sure why as I don't use Tiger for reit etf. Try buying CFA?,btohqsg
I think there're 3 REITs ETFs in SG  I can buy the other two without any hassle,btohqsg
but I want to buy all of them  for some sort of diversification üòÇ,btohqsg
If you don't want all the min spend tnc nonsense  just go for UOB Absolute with Grabpay Mastercard,btohqsg
There will be interlaps in the portfolio constituents so the diversification doesnt really work here. Diversification happens when the underlying business is different e.g. retail vs commercial vs industrial reit,btohqsg
true  but I think these three REITs ETFs have different region focus,btohqsg
üòÇ but you are right  they are all REITs and overlap with each other to some extent,btohqsg
Oh yes  saw that  but they don't have contactless payment haha!,btohqsg
Well you can use the grabpay MC contactlessly with the physical card or with Samsung pay,btohqsg
Just to add on   UOB Absolute AMex has 5% for first $3000 spend as a new customer  till 30 Sep 2021.So just top up $3000 to Grabpay and get $150 cashback,btohqsg
Anyone here applying for Aug 2021 Bto? It's out!,btohqsg
So effectively  top up grabpay if Plat user  its 5 + 1.2 = 6.2% cashback?,btohqsg
Correct  not bad for $3000 spending if you are new to bank,btohqsg
That's also true for Citi CashBack+  new users can get 4.5% for the first 5k spending,btohqsg
so that's $225  more than $150üòÜ,btohqsg
If you're a grab plat user and top up w UOB Absolute1st 3k spend = 5% + 1.2% (grab plat) = $1862nd 2k spend = 1.7% + 1.2% (grab plat) = $58Total cashback valuation of 5k spend = $244,btohqsg
true  but you can also top up Grab with this Citibank Cashback+,btohqsg
so in total  that's 5000 * (4.5% + 1.2%) = $285,btohqsg
Citi cashback plus allows wallet top ups?,btohqsg
Don't think so. So far only know AMEX true cashback and UOB Absolute,btohqsg
Yep thats what I know as well,btohqsg

Never heard of it  any details?,btohqsg
Just went to my PayLah! App to have a quick look  maybe the rebates is from the promotions here?,btohqsg
It is also possible the rebates are from the dbs loyalty program,btohqsg
Hi  has anyone compared singapore reits to us reits?,btohqsg

Credit cards for Fresh Grads:The ideal card will change over timeBut what will not change is:I just want to clarify as a fresh grad with new access to MONEY  first you have to determine your spending pattern  and that takes months.You could easily start with UOB Absolute AMEX + Grabpay to get up to 2.9% easily  while discovering your spend pattern in progress.Meanwhile  just sign up with the best new signup offers (Citi  DBS  SCB  using my affiliate links of course üëç). You don't have to spend on these cards (unless the tncs require you to)  just cancel after a few months to fulfill their tncs  rest for 1 year and get new signups again!,btohqsg

hi chris the latest video on hdb 2 room flexi flats for singles are quite informative. Just to share HDB in a email said it would update the status of application by early sept 2021. Previously was 1 year ! let me see if they indeed improve the customer experience.,btohqsg
Great to hear that üëçIt's honestly tough work for hdb staffs during this period. I could imagine the amount of questions and complaints they receive daily.,btohqsg
Good stuff Chris. Enjoyed your content on endowus,btohqsg
You piqued my interest on moneyowl tho,btohqsg
I might just go straight to moneyowl. Was almost ready to set up with endowus,btohqsg
Yeah MoneyOwl is really good deal for first $10000 with no fees! Above that amount then we can look at Endowus,btohqsg
Hi all  just wondering if anyone of you know which is the best electricity plan at the moment you'd recommend? I just got a place and am intending to choose a plan that is cheap  but yet efficient and sustainable haha. Happen to know of any?,btohqsg
Signed up.for geneco from day 1,btohqsg
tbh din interact much with them. just like their rates  i am on my 2nd contract with them,btohqsg
I'm with geneco 3 years plan. Ending next year.,btohqsg
No complaints  nothing much to impress also as usual for for utilities. Just make sure they work and bill accurately,btohqsg
Had the best referral and rates 2 years back? I think i got $110 signup bonus upfront,btohqsg
Now unsure of the market also haha,btohqsg
Hahaha can can thanks for that,btohqsg
I like the ease of it being on SP billing app,btohqsg
I have $3 off every month bill for 24 mths using uob card. I use uob one for it; helps with the $500 min spend,btohqsg
Your house must be huge! Haha.,btohqsg
It's just a part of the 500 lol,btohqsg
Need much more to hit the min 500!,btohqsg
When you hit $500  how much rebate do you get?,btohqsg
$500 * 3 months  3.33% base cashback$1000 * 3 months  3.33% base cashback$2000 * 3 months  5% base cashback.Additional cashback like 5% shopee  grab  cold storage  7 eleven not included yet,btohqsg
Actually  500 and 1000 the same lol. Good if this is a shared card haha.,btohqsg
Bear in mind uob one is one of the trickiest card to use because of the spend tracking effort. But high effort high rewards!,btohqsg
Chris  are you using UOB one?,btohqsg

Question why would 1 have so many credit card.. how to pay all annual fees or meet all min monthly expenses?,btohqsg
Mostly for signup bonuses.Don't pay annual fees  just waiveOwn it but dont have to spend on it until necessary,btohqsg
Then at the end of the free waiver year? We cancel it?,btohqsg
Request to waive again if you need.Cancel if you don't need. Fees are pre-charged so when you cancel the card  the charges go away too,btohqsg
I thought of this.. but it will not help with my credit score.. might get bad credit score because of cancelling cards,btohqsg
Does not matter permanently. It will only impact temporarily. Don't have to place so much emphasis on credit score unlike in the US,btohqsg
Oh  I thought it's a also a huge deal here.. like for house or car.. it just means we can get a bigger loan? Or I'm understanding it wrong?,btohqsg
I believe in singapore the only loan we should get is the Housing loan for the low interest rates.And if we're living within our means  then the loan quantum should not have a huge impact to our finances.,btohqsg
Therefore that only applies for Bank housing loan.. not HDB loan.. right?,btohqsg
If siblings join together to buy a flat(HDB) for rental. Is that possible? Or there are many red tapes for this such as the MOP or 1 door lock rule?,btohqsg
The t&cs are complicated but the short answer is No for rental. Hdb is primarily for own stay and not for profit.Applicable schemes for siblings are Orphan scheme and Joint singles scheme,btohqsg

I would like to learn how to manage a lot of credit cardsüòè,btohqsg
or maybe some advice on how many credit cards to have,btohqsg
üòÇ recent videos on CPF and HDB really have little to do with foreigners like me,btohqsg
How about taking loans to invest into the right tools.. and how to pay back the loans.. üòÑ,btohqsg
i would like a run through of IBKR platform and perhaps sharing of your portfolio there or ETFs/stocks that are interesting to invest in üòä,btohqsg
is that really legitimate in Singaporeü§î,btohqsg
This is quite subjective to individual though.I like to separate to active vs passive cardsActive: day to day use (we are limited to how much money we could spend)Passive: signup bonus only  12 mths later a new customer.,btohqsg
Understand. But these are priority issues where young singaporeans lack awareness of. So yeah  i need to address that market.,btohqsg
Yes  will be doing a in depth broker series on how to use them like a pro,btohqsg
cool  I only know how to buy & sellü§£,btohqsg
I'm not a loan person to be honest and my exposure is so minimal so that may not be the right time yet,btohqsg
alright! i'm using IBKR now  its okay but gosh the interface sucks! will be interesting to see what your opinion is on actively managed ETFs like ARKK! perhaps you could share more over a video.,btohqsg
Sometimes all we need in a broker are very simple priorities:1) how to buy/sell2) how to check whether order placed/order history3) how to deposit/withdrawThe rest are good to have features,btohqsg
If u could also  compare USA financial advice(everywhere on tiktok) vs Singapore financial systems,btohqsg
Chris  thanks for the DBS Taka credit card intro. Just to confirm this is applicable for existing posb and dbs account holders? Kindly advise.,btohqsg
I just found things in Takashimaya so expensiveüòÇ,btohqsg
Hey Chris and guys  not sure if it would be relevant but below topics can help:‚ÅÉInsurance (Buy or not to buy  what types  coverage  which provider)‚ÅÉBudgeting (healthy % allocation for expenses  wants  savings etc for different ppl at different stages of life)‚ÅÉFurther studies or career transition for working adults (skillsfuture  work study programme  professional conversion programme  is studying part-time masters worth it etc)‚ÅÉCrypto? (Though I know previously you have mentioned you are not yet ready to touch on this topic but i feel there is not much information in terms from Singapore context yet),btohqsg
To add  how to understand technical charts as a layman,btohqsg
Thanks Xin Yi  all these are good topics and I have noted of them. For those that are not my expertise  i will take some time and learn about them and then share my learning to provide a layman/beginner opinion,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I came across this investment platform (loan your money to start ups or SME) that says returns can be up to 24% in a year. Would you be able to share more about this?https://smartfunding.sg/investors/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=reach&utm_content=site-keywords&gclid=Cj0KCQjwpreJBhDvARIsAF1_BU2wX_lvaltpI7VoVVGdk2piKNFa-kBW8HV7UdjBL3xmuxZrrvGeYsYaAgKdEALw_wcB,btohqsg
I really doubt this  even without looking into it. Just the basic logic  if it's easy and safe for  these start-ups to make 24% profit yearly  then they have no need to borrow money from retail investors,btohqsg
this looks a bit like P2P lending in China years ago  which eventually turned out to be a disaster for investors,btohqsg
chris  can check for signing up revolut  what do i need to provide. can just use singpass only or still need to upload cetain doc?,btohqsg
Your analysis is in place  I agree with your point of view,btohqsg
Usually for such P2P loan business  is high risk high return. I won't go for it but if I do  just go for more established ones like Funding Societies where there are lots of reviews on the internet.Also this is no different from lending money to your friend. Only lend out how much you are willing to lose,btohqsg
It's been a long time since I started revolut (2019 maybe). Let me click on my own link and check,btohqsg
How much money did you make?,btohqsg
$10 every month from 20% transport cashback,btohqsg
No singpass from what i see,btohqsg
meaning need to upload some doc to establish identity?,btohqsg
http://bit.ly/sgmoomooüêÆMoomoo Brokers is back with Free Apple stock! T&C: FIRST deposit of S$2700 and complete 5 trades. So simpleüöÄ,btohqsg
Yeah maybe PFE take up rate was too low,btohqsg
I'm sure that's the reason ü§£ cuz at least for me  I was going to open an account but changed my mind when I realized I could not get an AAPL,btohqsg
Good opportunity now then! Remember to usehttp://bit.ly/sgmoomoo,btohqsg
üòÖ seems that we need an anti-spam bot in the group now,btohqsg
I do know and have used some good anti-spam bots  but their language is Chinese...  üò¢,btohqsg
Thanks! Testing the shieldy bot now,btohqsg
BTW  how can I check whether I have been qualified for the free AAPL share? I just did 5 very small transactions during the daytime  but seemed nothing happenedü§î,btohqsg
"Click on ""Me"" tab at bottom rightGo to ""FREE AAPL"" or ""FREE stock""Takes around 3 business days to credit in",btohqsg
okay  I found it now  thank youüëå,btohqsg
Hi guys  has anyone missed Credit Card payment for 2 months straight before? Now they are issuing me $200 worth of late fee charges üòÖ,btohqsg
How can this be as in how did I miss my payment?,btohqsg
I don't know what's going on  you can ask customer service,btohqsg
Basically  for Citi  the late fee waiver can only be done through robots lol. I have already requested for the waiver  but it was declined. Sadly!,btohqsg
Waiver for annual fee.. not late payment.. u can call to confirm..,btohqsg
Thanks  Hareez. Well I was directed to robots only. Lol!,btohqsg
Yeah  you will be talking to robot for annual waiver.. lol..,btohqsg
For Standard Chartered  i wrote in to the customer service department  to waive my annual fee when the bot rejected my request,btohqsg

Hi  has anyone tried to top up GrabPay with an AMEX card recently? I tried but failed  don't know why,btohqsg
Amex has such problems regularly.Usually just remove and add back a few hours later.Subject to grab daily topup limit of $5000,btohqsg
hi chris  since both tiger and moomoo giving AAPL  which platform would u recommend if only want to choose one?,btohqsg
Sign up for both to get 2 AAPL stocksThen use IBKR for lowest fees,btohqsg
also saw your video that you sold off Endowus Portfolio and reinvest Single Dimensional Global Core Equity Fund. can check what is the return like?,btohqsg
Since Aug 17.Was 0.8% up until this week slight drop in markets,btohqsg
Some 9.9 deals today- DBS Grocery 8% cashback capped at $8- 3000 Grabpoints on $75 transaction,btohqsg
ü§£ maybe it's because of the 99 sales,btohqsg
Anyone know of any good credit cards that is good for dining and grocery shopping without minimum spending? Haha!,btohqsg
Wa this one is everyone dream haha,btohqsg
I know :( Hard for me to hit minimum spending lol. I do spend a lot on other things  but those don't require credit card lol.,btohqsg
Using that now actually. Can't top up to GrabPay. LOL!,btohqsg
But use GrabPay to pay got rebates? I a bit noob in all these things. LOL,btohqsg
Yea encountered similar issue with amex before topping up grabpay,btohqsg
I know Chris mentioned something like 2.9% cashback? But not sure how that works.,btohqsg
monetary term cashback is 1.7 from the credit card itself,btohqsg
Yeah i going to apply to uob absolute today. Really good for paying premium insurance plus sign up get benefits closing 31st sept. Grabpay for points! Then got cashback for the uob card,btohqsg
Right! But don't have contactless payment damn sian. Anyone know why they do not have contactless payment? LOL,btohqsg
Helmi  when you say pay insurance  do you mean paying via AMEX?,btohqsg
There is. Apply for the grabpay card,btohqsg
I applied  but GrabPay can't link to my Apple Pay. Lol!,btohqsg
Have to open the Grab App. Sigh!,btohqsg
You can bring your grabpay card along with you then,btohqsg
I use my Apple Watch a lot and that feature will come in handy  but... Sigh!,btohqsg
No min spend and good rewards can't exist together (other than uob abs amex and grabpay combo),btohqsg
Swee  Bro! I am learning how to maximise the combo based on your video.,btohqsg
Yeah its a good move  do use my referrral link too!,btohqsg
Grabpay contactless only works with Samsung pay for now,btohqsg
Yes  ibkr  moomoo  tiger are all custodian,btohqsg
Lots of opportunities now closed. Two years ago if I started YT earlier can share even more hacks,btohqsg
It‚Äôs fine. Good enough already. Haha,btohqsg

Will use your referrals! I am intending to change my POSB card also. Don‚Äôt know if referral links will help haha.,btohqsg
Have no idea man. Waiting for Boss Chris to review lol!,btohqsg
Quite decent  it is in addition of all the new account bonuses.Anyway  updated my referral links athttps://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=124040923224466&id=108288068133085&sfnsn=mo(See pinned message),btohqsg
Anyone took credit sure plus together with uob absolute?,btohqsg
Its a product by prudential  UOB's insurance partner,btohqsg
Yea looks like a no go,btohqsg
seems that AMEX is still not workingüò¢ can be a bad sign,btohqsg
have  you try remove card and then reenter again,btohqsg
i did tha last time and it work,btohqsg
i tried last night. it worked..,btohqsg
I did  but that didn't help,btohqsg
Last time when i had this issue  i called amex (for true cashback card).If you're using uob amex then call uob. Most likely trigger a warning on their side and blocked grab for large amounts. Just need to manually unblock by CSO,btohqsg
For reference i did a $3000 grab top up through uob abs amex yesterday  went through fine,btohqsg
i cancelled my maybank fnf card in april. moved to citi cashback. citi cashback vs maybank fnf  which do you guys think is better? use mainly for groceries (redmart)  dining  food delivery and online shopping. from what i read on hwz  for fnf  lazada and shopee are not included in online shopping but qoo10 is.,btohqsg
im considering switching back to fnf. they recently revamped their Treats app. you can track your eligible cashback almost instantaneuosly.,btohqsg
If qoo10 is eligible for fnf thats a great opportunity already,btohqsg
why do you say that  chris? most stuff on qoo10 i can find on shopee and lazada and usualyl cheaper eh,btohqsg
what's your take on citi cashback vs maybank fnf?,btohqsg
I take a more holistic approach not just on base price but vouchers  card discounts  affiliate fees,btohqsg
So i try to compare across,btohqsg
hm yea thats a fair point. tough choice between citi cashback and maybank fnf for me...,btohqsg
But to be fair  most of the time shopee wins   coupled with uob one 10%,btohqsg
For me easily fnf because of the wider categories  even with the smaller limit. Will do a video on this next time,btohqsg
Unless say u have $800 a month grocery spending  then easily citi cashback,btohqsg
one very frustrating thing is grabfood. ineligible for cashbacks on either card,btohqsg
no choice got to uob amex abso -> grabpay for that,btohqsg
Yup  grabfood always follows transport mcc. So just uob one for me,btohqsg
man  i get sick tracking the stupid uob month cycle,btohqsg
Uob one is very tough  that's why thre rewards are high,btohqsg
Think uob one its good when you got a certain high and fixed expense allocated. The mafan comes in if theres variable high expense then need to keep track everytime.,btohqsg
All variable expense: Uob amex grabpay$300 fixed expense: maybank platinum visa$500 fixed expense: uob one  citi smrt$600 fixed expense: ocbc frank  dbs live fresh  uob evol$800 fixed expense: maybank fnf  citi cashback$1000 fixed expense: uob one  maybank platinum visa$2000 fixed expense: uob one,btohqsg
^Above is for cashback cards onlyDoes not apply to miles/rewards cards,btohqsg
things got really weird now.. I could not even use my visa cardüò¢,btohqsg
Nice video!!! Thanks for sharing. But damn your net worth at 12YO is more than my net worth after I grad from uni hahah ü§≠,btohqsg
I remember we used to play/collect those flag erasers during primary school too hahaha,btohqsg
Must be coming from the huge student loan debts? Haha  next time I will talk about it,btohqsg
Yes  like which country eraser somehow has magic power over others,btohqsg
Embarrass to say that it must be from all the hanging out with friends for social activities ü§≠,btohqsg
Yeah all these discretionary stuff sure adds up,btohqsg
The truth is  the more friends you have  might not necessarily make you more happy. BUT definitely make you spend more money!,btohqsg
Hey Chris  for Absolute Card to be able to earn 2.9% from GRAB pay  you will need to be a platinum member first right?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I've downloaded the Revolute app  but how do I get the $20 from your referral link?,btohqsg
24h left for Revolut $20!Remember to complete three $10 transactions using your virtual card that you could activate instantly after sign up and top up,btohqsg
Hi  do you have any suggested way to top up Kopitiam prepard card? I just found that it's not eligible for Citi Cashback +,btohqsg
Uob absolute amex or Grabpay mc,btohqsg
ü§£ amex + grabpay  the ultimate solution to all problems,btohqsg
Yeah  it use to be Uob one + grabpay to EVERY problem,btohqsg
btw  for anyone who was interested in the weird issue: I contacted Grab and they told me because I added too many card (>5 cards) to my GrabPay account  my account was put into some blacklist for risk control. Then I was required to provide photos of these cards to refresh my account and now everything works fine,btohqsg
Hihi wish to check if there are still any promos for sign up of revolu card?,btohqsg
Revolut public transport cashback is in!,btohqsg
Hi all  want to ask if it makes sense to transfer my parent‚Äôs CPF OA to RA if they have finished paying the house and don‚Äôt intend to purchase house in the future? Since OA is only 2.5% and RA is 4%,btohqsg
How long for the transport cash back to be credited ah?I one month le still no sign of it,btohqsg
Yes if no use for OA anymore,btohqsg
Am I right that  there is no way they can make any withdrawal from OA if BRS is not met after 55?,btohqsg
The payment can be for anything right?,btohqsg
Done  hopefully all have been well captured.,btohqsg

Now am more financial aware and more knowledge about it. Uob + grabpay. Really best in the market. Hahaha!!! Thanks chris!!,btohqsg
Hello everyone! Nice to be in this group :),btohqsg
Just wanna if anyone can help out. Im currently considering to have an ‚Äúall-in-one‚Äù card and narrowed down to UOB one card and OCBC 365. UOB one card speaks on its own and is quite highly reviewed but the 365 have no much recommendations though. Anyone have any views or opinions? Thanks in advanceüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ,btohqsg
Depending on your spending. Fixed amount per month vs variable spending per month.,btohqsg
My spendings would be ard 1-1.5k monthly,btohqsg
However i do know that 365 have a $80 cashback cap. Maybe thats the drawback of that card?,btohqsg
My suggestion (not financial advisor) is ocbc for your case.,btohqsg
Yeah for uob one great if you have fix amount and youre able to keep track of spending. Cash back is good there.,btohqsg
Omg thank you much for this!‚ò∫Ô∏èüôèüèΩüôèüèΩüôèüèΩ,btohqsg
Most welcome! Got to give it to chris! Hahah who started this sharing community!,btohqsg
Yea. Thanks to him as well i got into this community :),btohqsg
Whack cpf investing  insurance  credit card usage(if you know how to handle it)  personal finance,btohqsg
Been cracking my head alot tryna find that 1 card where i can put most of my spendings in. Like i know no 1 card is perfect but finding the best card for me personally can be quite tricky üòÖüôèüèΩ,btohqsg
On surface level  Ocbc365 seems better for the higher cashback % in 6% dining and food deliveryBut uob one also has additional cashback +5% merchants like shopee  grab   giant.Ocbc is also not friendly to fee waivers.So depends on what your spending merchants are?,btohqsg
Or you could do the DBS live fresh  uob evol  ocbc frank  each min spend $600/mth,btohqsg
Been long standing order of no credit card and not believing into insurance but recently heavily in research and get myself into it. Having to take control of finance will be added advantage to financial freedom! (Not insurance agent or financial advisor here lol!),btohqsg
I would say telco bills  dining  retail  petrol and groceries comprises most of my monthly spendings. Planing to use card up to use tax  insurance and parking as well,btohqsg
Hmm i have a frank debit card which i am considering to frank credit card but the cashback feels like too general üòÖ correct me if im wrong üôèüèΩ,btohqsg
Zar i just make my payment using uob + grabpay yesterday for insurance,btohqsg
On topic of petrol for those who ride or drive  where do you pump at and why,btohqsg
I'll start with myself - sinopec,btohqsg
Hahaha. Same2. I recently too did some research and got to know the benefits of credit cards. And i too agree on the financial control which ultimately leads to financial freedom,btohqsg
Oh wow. Did u get better rewards that way?,btohqsg
For sinopec only Bukit Timah one is 24% everyday,btohqsg
Hows the quality? Run further miles etc?,btohqsg
Im currently on Shell. Rider card 14% upfront. Hence thinking of using CC now üòÖ,btohqsg
Use credit top up to grab pay(get cash back) then grab to pay to insurance (get grabpay rewards),btohqsg
Ahh icic but is there still cashback for grabpay topup? I heard recently they stopped,btohqsg
Pay insurance got grab pay rewards?,btohqsg
Only uob absolute amex and amex tcb can,btohqsg
No points for insurance  mine is prudential ipay. Got points for ntuc membership,btohqsg
I did my mortgage insurance last mth with my partner  cannot leh,btohqsg
The call operator say de. I did before paying. I can raise issue if never credit in. Cover myself haha,btohqsg
Telco  dining   groceries can use Maybank Familiy and FriendsRetail use general paywave card or mall vouchersPetrol go with the bank that gives you more discount (drivers pls advise),btohqsg
Haven't explored since no mortgage yet,btohqsg
Compare mortgage insurance to term insurance cost and benefit. Ultimately it is to pay up the mortgage if something unfortunate hapoen to you/owner of the property. If term coverage can cover the mortgage then why still need mortgage insurance? Something to think aboutDidclaimer: i havent research on such things yet  so take it as pinch of salt,btohqsg
Ahh icic. Then in a way 365 would kind of suit me better since i dont hit the 2k/monthly spendings üòÖ,btohqsg
Well  but u can hit 1k in spending which is 3.33% + 5% additional,btohqsg
Ahh icic. Thanks for the advice üôèüèΩ,btohqsg

I mean shops like redwhite on shopee/q10,btohqsg
My iPhone 12 was around 300 cheaper from these 3rd party sellers.,btohqsg
Yup. I'll put up some reputable shop links when their iphone 13 is on sale. I only recommend those that I have tested and verified authentic,btohqsg
Hmm ü§î if let say I trade my iPhone XR 128GB for this iPhone 11 128GB is it worth it ?,btohqsg
Not much diff from 10 to 11.12 or 13 will be much better,btohqsg
Anyway  each sequential successor of iPhone usually adds around $200-$300. But it comes with 1 more year of system updates  better chip  better camera  smaller notch (maybe?). That's about it. So you have to weigh your own cost vs benefit to see if it makes sense,btohqsg
i jumped fro mthe first gen iphone X to iphone 12 pro max.,btohqsg
shocked at the speed and tech specs of iphone 12 pro max lol,btohqsg
used my iphone x for 3 years  thinking that the tech development wont be much  but 3 years worth of development is quite a big jump haha.,btohqsg
Also maybe share what phone are you currently using!Mine is a 2nd hand Samsung S10+,btohqsg
Was using a brand new Samsung A51 last year and it's poor. For the same price +$100 to get a faster chip and better specs S10+ is a no brainer,btohqsg
Wanted to try the Samsung flip but seeing the review not worth my invest of the new phone to use,btohqsg
Suprised no one here 12 months or lesser (yet),btohqsg
On the iPhone topic  is it necessary to get Apple care? If yes  where to get it at a cheaper price,btohqsg
Not an apple iphone user here. But since I don't extend warranty on other brands  i dont see the value in it,btohqsg
Hi  Does top up grabpay or shopee pay using citibank credit card also consider spending?,btohqsg
No but you could use Amex true cashback or Uob absolute amex  both eligible,btohqsg
Sry but even if a spending is not eligible for cashback for that certain card  would it still be counted in the spending pool? Especially for those cards with minimum spending per month üôèüèΩ,btohqsg
Not all.Like dbs yes but uob no,btohqsg
Maybank used to be yes but now tnc says no  so i didn't try anymore,btohqsg
How about paying for season parking or telcobill? I tried read the T&C  not very clearing stated.,btohqsg
Season parking and telco bill can use grabpay mastercard,btohqsg
Shopee offers AppleCare at 15% off:https://shopee.sg/product/442800909/12801910348?smtt=0.201275614-1632635124.9,btohqsg
Can instarem link with Gemini Mastercard ?,btohqsg
Not sure as I don't have the card,btohqsg
haha btw can link the Instarem card with revolut card?,btohqsg
Maybe but why would you do that when you can link with Citi Rewards  DBS WWMC for 4mpd and FnF for 8%?,btohqsg
With the instarem card   exclusion will become included since it will be just categorise as online transaction?,btohqsg
Negative. The underlying card tncs still remain. E.g. whatever that earns rewards point on citi rewards will still earn  but those excluded will still not earn. It's just an intermediary,btohqsg
Hi everyone. Any opinions on whether to do individual stock picking on tiger or have a portfolio full of ETFs on syfe? New investor that prefers stability,btohqsg
"I've been a syfe user for about 2 months + now. Really quite confused about their advertising saying what ""15% growth for equity 100"" and ""4-7%"" for retis. But in reality both portfoilios made 0 gains and significant losses for retis.Take note that im not an influencer who receive referral bonus unlike the people which syfe advertises on their social media",btohqsg
if you are not familiar with a sector  e.g. healthcare but wish to invest in it as it is considered quite a defensive sector  u can consider the syfe that also includes ARKG for them to do the job for you. As it may be too technical for general layman   too much effort for research and theres knowledge gap. However  if for particular stocks that u are have some knowledge and done your due diligence   risk to rewards  u may invest directly using tiger to buy the individual stocks. Syfe can be like the foundation   as it buys into etfs. While u stock pick and buy individual stocks on your own .,btohqsg
"Meanwhile for tiger  it always seems that I'm very sway that after buying a stock  it goes downhill. Seems like I'm ""buying high and selling low"" instead. Not supposed to be like this? Not trying to time the market but  perhaps Im more suited for etf?",btohqsg
Yes. For a new Investor that prefers 10-15% growth  one time lump sum instead of DCA  has a rather diverisifed portfoilio  not sure why both syfe and tiger all losses. Is not like I'm day trading or buying penny stocks. Is all established stocks like appl  fb  tsmc  Nike. Everything red,btohqsg
Yes me too. For me  I took up the cash+ portfolio.To me it seems like those money market funds wtih low lying interest and stable. However  it was not. 2 days gain was shown as $0.12 while after another 3 days showing as -$3,btohqsg
if you are holding for long term  short term market volatility and market correction should not affect you too much . Instead  each month when u have additional new cashflow  u can DCA in.,btohqsg
"üòÇüòÇ I gave up on syfe cash+ alr. It says ""1.5% projected returns"". Not sure how true.I recently started my own custom portfoilios on syfe. Because there are components within equity 100 that I don't like- ex: kraneshares china. I don't want any China etfs for now",btohqsg
Hmm but syfe helps you to buy small proportions (like 0.02  0.03) of the etf whenever there are gains? So is like the gains are reinvested?,btohqsg
"if u look at the ""transactions""  u can see the dividends received  bought and sold by syfe from time to time",btohqsg
Actually I'm Kenna losing faith in investing. Cos ex: if u buy apple on tiger for 148.. then it goes up to 154... Huh? $6 can barely buy 1 meal of cai fan. What's the point? üòÇüòÇ All these speculation  affect mental well being negatively.Then ok if raises to 154  then after last Monday crash to 143. All gains of the past 2 months + wipe in 1 day. What's the point ah?,btohqsg
Focus on the business  and fundamentals  not so much on the price. The price is a reflection of investors confidence.  If you have done enough research and due diligence on a company  you should be confident that in long run it will move up eventually . Need to have conviction before investing into a company  if not will end up buying high  selling low,btohqsg
Syfe charges 0.65%. so that's like 5$ for the first 10K invested every month.. but I mean if I can get 10-20% growth I won't mind paying 0.65%. but now is mostly all portfoilios negative... Disappointed,btohqsg
The issue with index ETF is... If I get on tiger... Means I need to hold it for as long as possible. Because if I sell  is sell the entire thing. Whereas if I get index ETF on syfe.. I can choose to transfer out any % of it anytime. So is more flexible? But syfe charges 0.65% every month unlike tiger+ Syfe doesn't even have all the index ETF. Only VTI  RSP I think... Quite limited,btohqsg
Yup. I did a small amt of research through Motley fool. So I got things like Nvidia  tsmc  apple  AMD  FB P&G  Starbucks  JnJ. A good mix of tech  big moat companies  dividend stocks.  So far mostly all red on tiger. Awful.Is not like I'm choosing meme stocks like amc mah. üòÇNot sure why everything Kenna red.,btohqsg
tiger needs to buy 1 unit .  Syfe  when u withdraw  they sell off fraction units of diff etfs.,btohqsg
Recently market isnt doing too well in general . Market will eventually recover again... i hope haha,btohqsg
All these are great businesses so should be good to hold.Don't lose faith so fast yet.When i started investing (SG stocks). It took 3 years for me to just breakeven,btohqsg
Etf via ibkr  vwra buy and hold if you want stable but not spectacular results,btohqsg
if not use syfe  haha robo advisors serve to eliminate emotions in investing.  So just need to do a fixed monthly recurring amount into the portfolio .,btohqsg
Doing this for me and my partner joint acct,btohqsg
Have a bit of arkk as well,btohqsg
Wow 3 years... I'm not sure I can tolerate that üòÇ SG retis have been terrible recently. More specifically syfe. Because they say they track S RETI. I'm not sure if I shld just shift to getting specific retis like mapletree logistics and industrial on tiger... Too much diversification isnt good...,btohqsg
"Ya. Cos daily monitoring of stock price on tiger will go crazy. Especially recently when Facebook and Nike ""crashed"". All the gains wiped. Seems like will take very long to recover",btohqsg
although some business are great  but need to also take note of the valuations  if it is overpriced  then will take longer to breakeven.,btohqsg
Yes I have ARKK ARKQ ARKW ARKG ARKF in 1 portfoilio in syfe. let's see how Kathie wood does lor. I mean if active ETF can outperform passive ETF I won't mind üòÇ,btohqsg
Yeah I use to have like 15 REITs plus other blue chip traps before i condense to just 5 now  and shift the rest to US markets. They all had a pretty good run until 2020 Mar,btohqsg
For me and my partner I don't wanna monitor so much our joint account,btohqsg
haha sometimes is better not to look... not to monitor especailly for ETFs.. the less you do  the less mistakes. keep it there  let it work for u,btohqsg
And invested abit in arkk as well,btohqsg
Just need 3 etfs:World indexS&p500Nasdaq 100Good to go for long term,btohqsg
Arkk is just to test Cathy's investment acumen,btohqsg
Her etfs are too fast moving. Need more monitoring than vwra lol,btohqsg
I got things like: VTI  RSP  QQQ  VTV  ARKK  SDY on syfe. Aren't too shabby isn't it? Mainly 100% US market tho  I don't want China üòÇ esp after what happened on Monday,btohqsg
Yeah she was goddess of 2020  not so much in 2021 for her picks,btohqsg
Yes I intend to buy and hold. Don't want to monitor. No time for that. But is true that if u lumpsum into syfe  can never achieve the projected gains compared to DCA?,btohqsg
Another thing about ARK is the high expense ratio of about 0.79% if I'm not wrong. One thing about syfe is that they don't disclose that this expense ratio is paid on top and over their 0.65% charge. Means it's really expensive to hold etf on syfe. Yet  if u get etf on tiger  it's 1 unit as mentioned . Means no transferring out halfway  and it's all about timing market and guessing when to sell which defeats the purpose of passive investing,btohqsg
Yupp  unless u buy 10 units  sell afew units when u feel its overpriced or a correction is going to happen? Haha that's why for passive investment   I feel it's always easier to buy the dip rather than timing when to sell and buy back.. easier to buy when low rather than constantly trying to time the market trying to beat it.. as mentioned the more u do  more susceptible to mistakes. In the end   better off just holding to until one day u decided on a better investment opportunity or if its a stock.. if the fundamentals changed.. its time to sell off.,btohqsg
yup i think ARK is a hype ETF eh.,btohqsg
but if i dont buy into the hype and it really isnt a hype etf  then it's a waste haha,btohqsg
ARK is so 2020. Long dead in 2021. So what's the latest hype ETF now again? üòÇüòÇ Nothing can beat tried and tested ETFs like SPY and VTI. the track record shows,btohqsg
Anyway knows the difference between hype ETF Vs momentum investing? (MTUM)?,btohqsg
tried and tested also can include VWRA and IWDA i suppose?,btohqsg
Haven't really heard of them b4. I'm more into vanguard  nasdaq and Invesco,btohqsg
^ regarding the poll  the reason why I like honey money cos it's honest review of portfoilios.Didn't have a good experience with some other YouTubers (not naming who) who said things like it's a good time to invest in retis when inflation rises. Not true at all- just see the syfe retis Portfolio. Crashed worse than equity 100.,btohqsg
Excluded Chicken Genius Singapore as he is less active now.,btohqsg
I believe people follow kelvin also because his content is quite relatable as well? Like other are mostly in financial industry if I am not wrong?,btohqsg
Thanks GY. Not speaking on behalf on others but sometimes we must understand that Content Creator job is to create content and generate sales. But whether it is content with integrity  that makes the difference,btohqsg
And he is also rather entertaining   reusing recycling cold jokes... over and over again. But still quite funny..,btohqsg
üëçüëç true! But a lot of them once they are more well known they get blinded by greed,btohqsg
for investing  best to follow those that show their live trading account.,btohqsg
i mean this apply to all kind of youtuber/influencers,btohqsg
He says.. if we burn.. he burns more,btohqsg
he go holiday liao ytd last video in that studio lol,btohqsg
Maybe he go find Elon Mars ah hahah,btohqsg
haha actually a bit scary all eggs in one basket. of course if huat then huat big. but what happens if Elon end up like Steve.,btohqsg
True conviction towards tesla   at least he made a stand,btohqsg
CGS is very extreme and has strong personality  thats why he have lots of followers (and haters at the same time). But unless you have deep pockets like him  it is rrally a big bet,btohqsg
Oh yeah. Kevin is really good and relatble also. And also very up to date. Like he will explain about the latest developments like the evergrande within the week of the development.,btohqsg
Ya agreed  he did lots of research and have strong conviction towards tesla. If it's me I cannot sleep at night hahaha,btohqsg
Hahah if cannot sleep can call him  he will scold u  not to be donkey,btohqsg
all of you follow him all eggs into tesla also?,btohqsg
Hahah don't have a deep pocket,btohqsg
I didnt know of him then. Now that tesla is alrdy up.. haha will follow him on his other stocks instead,btohqsg
"Kevin likes to make funny jokes about how ETF is like picking cai fan and say funny ""orhorr"" jokes sometimes. But I subscribe to more than just him ah. Support local channels",btohqsg
don't need deep pocket cause US can buy fractional shares. but if anyone dare all eggs into one stock  I Salute him or her.,btohqsg
I currently own Tesla through ETF in syfe. Not through individual stock  cos it's abit too voliatle for my liking.,btohqsg
now buy fish at cai fan stall will think of him hahaha,btohqsg
tiger I not sure but ibkr can,btohqsg
His jokes always reuse and recycle,btohqsg
Kevin's mind:25% fish - ARKK25% veg- VTI25% potato- SPY25% seafood- VOOThere u go! Custom portfoilio!,btohqsg
wow i didnt know about fractional shares...haha thanks for sharing!! Will check it out,btohqsg
Haha yea but I think when it comes to stock pick.. probably I follow cgs sniper theory,btohqsg
Kevin said see stock price  see everyday  stock price your head ah! üòÇüòÇüòÇ he shld go to the tiger official telegram to tell ppl stop seeing stock price üòÇ see what happens,btohqsg
ya if still young and have excess money can sniper. if reach certain age got family and loans to manage  better diversify a bit cannot afford to lose everything and restart in life at certain age.,btohqsg
Suddenly honey money telegram become Kelvin learns investing üòÇ,btohqsg
It's okay to discuss other people content as long as no negativity or hate comments,btohqsg
I get some ideas from them too,btohqsg
Go big or go home hahaha,btohqsg
put all in one stock? i think hahaha,btohqsg
Day trading? Options? Chim eh. Or meme stock?,btohqsg
I think Kelvin got explain what are options before but I still don't understand lol üòÇ,btohqsg
Haha yupp I rly appreciate and thankful for all the hardwork from you guys   it rly takes lots of time and effort to be constantly posting content,btohqsg
yeah!! üëç i think is the personality behind the YouTube account also  Kelvin and CGS now have their own style,btohqsg
Diff. Content creator each have their strengths üí™,btohqsg
How many stocks is too much or too little? I think motley Fool said 20-30 is a good range or something? Is not easy to balance between too much or too little diverisificatiob,btohqsg
yeah u can buy 0.1 share also. so for 79 usd u can be a tesla shareholder  commission I think is usd 1 dollar. so u can dca every month without fear. its like a sniper with 1000 bullets to aim at one enemy.,btohqsg
Kelvin for some reason is able to appeal to us locals. Idk if he knows it himself  but his delivery is fantastic,btohqsg
Tiger can buy 0.1 share? :O,btohqsg
I think he doesn't realise that it's his strength,btohqsg
I don't have tiger bro so can't speak for it sorry üôèüèª,btohqsg
I think the older videos can see him read off the script. But now is very natural. Straight to camera and can flow,btohqsg
Then which platform is that? Moomoo?,btohqsg
Everyday also see Moomoo's ad on youtube,btohqsg
"Did y'all hear the moomoo ad on MRT nowadays? Freaking me out. It's like a ghost screaming  ""download moomoo now  moo .. moo!!!!""",btohqsg
Ooo ok. I'll check out IB. Cos now I only got tiger and syfe. I don't use moomoo or stashway,btohqsg
Btw stashaway also recently copied syfe and release thematic portfoilio üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
if i may add my opinion here  i feel chris provides a more holistic approach to financial mgmt  covering more ground. kelvin's content is almost all about investing.,btohqsg
so mixing both chris and kelvin is the optimal portfolio,btohqsg
Well  because he is not Kelvin learns personal finance,btohqsg
"You see his banner has ""credit cards""  but i guess thats not profitable haha",btohqsg
I mean much less earning than investing content,btohqsg
Actually i came across chris channel on his earlier video on how to get iphone and macbook for cheap,btohqsg
Yea I was trying to find out more of credit cards Is where I know of chris,btohqsg
Too many cards out there..  rly gives me a huge headache...,btohqsg
That's why u probably didn't vote in my community poll on which video did u subscribe from ahha,btohqsg
Interestingly I'm getting quite a few subs from my carousell video (SEA region),btohqsg
all looking of ways to make carouHELL a better place haha,btohqsg
So anyone came here from CPF or HDB videos?Trying to address everyone here,btohqsg
Heard of the IM65 strategy from Loo tho not currently investing more into cpf,btohqsg
is it true that CPF board will ban shielding in future?,btohqsg
For cpf to ban shielding  first it has to ban investing using SA,btohqsg
So unless this first step is achieved  all are just rumours,btohqsg
I think the 1M65 group already discussed it. But CPF is not against investing using SA  but are against financial planners who push such products for sale to their clients to earn their commission,btohqsg
What CPF could do is just Regulate to allow withdrawing OA to RA instead of SA. This will kill off all competition from financial planners. But they are not doing it because  reasons? Idk,btohqsg
Does anyone know what's the reason for the general slide in big tech stock recently? Is not like got evergrande crisis daily right ?,btohqsg
I also want to know haha  think everyone still haven get over it  still having fear ü§£,btohqsg
US market seems to be going up too high previously.. so I guess it's quite normal to have some sort of correction as well,btohqsg
Choose the right stocks to enter at a discount price,btohqsg
Cathie seems to be reducing tesla tho,btohqsg
She needs to keep the portfolio allocation balanced> And TSLA rising this past week may be a good time for her to sell,btohqsg
Ya see. What's the point. When appl stock price raise from 148 154  6$ can buy what? Then drop everyone complain. Endless speculation. Yawns... So bad for mental health everday see a whole sea of red..,btohqsg
for me  when I get my salary  I simply DCA into my favorite stocks and then leave my Tiger App unopened until next payrollü§£,btohqsg
Bruh  I have one whole section of referral links already with Citi included,btohqsg
Can I know  if we link this to a Mastercard which originally gives rebates for grocery  but the use of amaze card changes the MCC to online spend  does that mean it no longer qualifies as grocery spending?,btohqsg
Doesn't matter since it is the MCC qualified,btohqsg

No worries. Good to know that Citi is always upping their sign up bonus game,btohqsg
Whole portfoilio red again? Not even evergrande again everything red. Investing sucks...,btohqsg
Seems like it's evergrande daily from today onwards. What's the point of investing. Just gonna lose everything to 0.,btohqsg
Instarem card give additional 1 percent on all transactions? Any exclusions? So if I connect to revolut to pay for insurance? Get extra 1 more percent?,btohqsg
You can try as I dont have the Revolut Mastercard. Mine is a Visa,btohqsg
Oooh haha   they have both visa and Mastercard..  wonder how they decide who to receive mc who to receive visa,btohqsg
I think early adopters (pre-2021) are majority Visa. Then mastercard for those 2021 applications,btohqsg
It's a trend like with Citi too  moved almost all their card products from V to MA,btohqsg
And then you have AMZN having surcharges with Visa cards.Locally  Grab charging $1 for Grabpay top ups with visa frpm Oct 1,btohqsg
On a side note Evergrande 3333 is up 12%,btohqsg
Crypto this whole month in red ü•≤,btohqsg
im signing up for comfortdelgro app  is there referral code for that? haha,btohqsg
If everyone is ready  there won't be a crash,btohqsg
Truth is  a crash happens when we least expect it,btohqsg
Yup. It further crashed last night.,btohqsg
Am I the only one with 100% of my portfoilios on syfe and 100% of my stock pick ok tiger all negative? I'm probably the worst investor ever,btohqsg
Seems like I'm investing to follow the opposite of s&p500- yearly returns of negative 15%>,btohqsg
Thank you! I thought this video would have gotten more dislikes haha,btohqsg
You probably just entered at a bad timing like early aug or sep,btohqsg
Hahah yep. So is a good time to test the hypothesis that time in the market beats timing the market right ? We will see,btohqsg
Maybe next time should withdraw everything by August. Wait for 3 months then put everything back in December. To avoid the volality üòÇ,btohqsg
Maybe just top up CPF SA and MA to max for 4%. And then churn credit cards for confirmed returns.,btohqsg
My CPF alr top up alot alr. Don't want everything cpf üòÇ,btohqsg
"If I were to start my own YouTube channel  will probably make vids like ""hidden rules ppl don't say about investing""- like how September is historically the most voliatle",btohqsg
Is there more than just september?,btohqsg
Hahah aug seems to be all time high in US   so if enter in Aug   Sept everything went down,btohqsg
Let's hope for a better oct,btohqsg
Is okay not to look good in the short term..,btohqsg
Hi  do you have any recommendation for option trading platform? I think Tiger and Moomoo can do  but I'm just wondering if there're better choices,btohqsg
cool  seems that IBKR is always the best choice as for feesü§£,btohqsg
Yes  the only downside of ibkr is the learning curve and the low referral benefits compared to M and T,btohqsg
Haha hope you will videos on options one day,btohqsg
One day... Still a beginner learning options,btohqsg
You have to trade options per 100 units  that's the thing that makes me really unhappy :(,btohqsg
ü§£ as I don't have that much money,btohqsg
Should start with selling optionsSell secured puts of a stock that you don't mind to ownSell covered calls if you already own 100 units of a stock,btohqsg
can explore bull put spread and bear call spread if funds limited,btohqsg
Good day for crypto hodlers though,btohqsg
Does anyone know what is a good balance of portfolio between US equities and SG REITs for a young investor? Like 70-30? üòÇ,btohqsg
Is it more economical to hold SG retis on broker apps like tiger or through robo like syfe?,btohqsg
I think 70 30 is fine. Like if your age is 30 then 30% reits/dividend stocks would be quite comfortable,btohqsg
I think the former one is better as long as you are not going to buy a very small amount. Robo-advisors would take extra fees like 0.5% annually and Tiger has already offered a very competitive fee rate.,btohqsg
(but it's easier to use Robos  as you don't need to choose REITs yourself then,btohqsg
Yeah can Kenna agree. So robo is better for DCA into ETFs? Cos for brokers it's just buy at that price. Very hard to DCA. but yeah robo charge holding fees of like 0.65% every single month,btohqsg
You can still do DCA with brokers  and that's what I am doing nowü§£,btohqsg
every month  I deposit some money into my broker account and then buy a fixed amount of ETFs,btohqsg
0.65% per year  not per month,btohqsg
On the website it says per month? For example for the first 10 000 syfe said 0.65% charged. Means about 65$ a year / 5.41$ a month,btohqsg
Markets closed green  guess they loved the new Merck magic pill news,btohqsg
If I transfer 100 from bank  then subsequently use up  then topup via grab mc  will it 20 percent or 2 percent? Or I must always topup from bank to receive the 20 percent?,btohqsg
Monthly do 1 time $100 from bank is good enough,btohqsg
I'm going to buy something with USD  what's the best way to pay with a good exchange rate and minimum feesü§£,btohqsg
Instarem with Citi rewards or DBS WWMC if you are into mileshttps://youtu.be/aw5HHAjCu5M,btohqsg
ü§£ I'm not into miles but cashback,btohqsg
I tried PayPal (no fee but its exchange rate is terrible) and Citibank Cashback+ (with 1% currency conversion fee),btohqsg
