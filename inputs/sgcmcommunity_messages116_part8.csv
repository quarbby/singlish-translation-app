Dear XXX I'm writing down with concern regarding fuel prices in SG. According to the chart extracted from XXX  during this time frame  price of oil per barrel has fallen by XX or X%. However during this same period  our prices of oil at our petrol stations has either remained stagnant or increase XX%.Due to current inflation rate  it doesn't make sense that the prices of oil did not fall or move in tandem with cost of oil per barrel.Furthermore  Shell has recorded a record breaking 40 billion profit in their latest reporting. Is this a sign of profiteering?If GST and cost has risen up and they increase oil prices  shouldn't their profits increase in tandem? Instead  it has spiked XX fold.Hope to hear your actions or actions you are going to take to ensure that Singaporeans will be able to tide through this period of tough times  in lieu of the upcoming expected recession.Yours sincerely A concerned Resident struggling to live in Singapore,btohqsg
