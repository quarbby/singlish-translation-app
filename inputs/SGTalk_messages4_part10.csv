In you can remember  it was WP who proposed to relook as the salaries of the parliament members are too low,btohqsg
I prefer progressive wages which will help the lower income to justify the salaries increase and help employers understand the increase in pay.Now security officers average is about $1.9KCleaners are able to clock an increase in pay too,btohqsg
Anyways I am ok with opposition in parliament which I think it is good tooBut I am not ok when opposition just opposed without thinking properly and don’t even know the opposition leaders are the ones who called for the increase in MPs pays.Singaporeans need to know who asked for the increase of the parliament members salaries which is in this case the WP.  Why put the blame to PAP?  When PAP supports WP suggestions  they get whacked. When PAP don’t support WP  also get whacked.  This is a very bad climate.,btohqsg
As far I remember  WP has said minister salary is too high  they did not ask for increase,btohqsg
Anyway the topic of discussion now is for the bottom income earners,btohqsg
I am not ok that when people compare against different parties  they treat as if it is an equal fight between pap and opposition. It is never an equal fight  the oppo is so much disadvantaged  whereas pap is the gov and has all the power and resources,btohqsg
Worse are those that when oppo make some minor mistake it is totally blown out of proportion  but when pap make major mistakes it is ignored,btohqsg
￼ ￼ July 19th  2020 | ￼ Author: Contributions￼After reading the article on “I am a Seng Kang voter” and many other articles on MSM  I had some reflections. For your information  I voted PAP all my life as I was having good job and pay. I never told all my friends who I voted  I pretended I don’t really care about who wins  as long as my estate is well managed and water still flows.Actually I am quite aware of whats going on in Singapore  we are surely moving to 6.9M or even 10M  it will come. I believe that Singapore is a small country and we need more people to consume so that the country will become prosperous with GDP growth. Of course  I know whatever the government says or hints  it will happen and we citizens no matter how much we complain or do those feedback  they will still do what they want to do.I worked for IT MNC  I was middle management. Over the years  the company had imported so many foreigners that now more than half were foreigners and most are with PRs or new citizenships. It did not affect my job  I collected by five figure a month happily. However  last year the management changed  CECA imported aka new citizen became my boss. And to cut the story short  that was end of my career  I was pushed to limits and pressure forced me to resign. And my replacement  you know better. I quitted my job believing that my knowledge and skills would easily get me another one somewhere. Days turns into months and I remained unemployed since. I used to think people who voted oppositions are those complaint kings who are lazy and instead of upgrading  they complain and complain; in my eyes these people are standard opposition supporters. I went to WSG and E2i events  for your information  they are useless for PMETs  they just want you to rewrite CVs or do some low level menial jobs meant for lower secondary education. Sometimes I wonder why experienced and knowledgeable PMETs like us need to go upgrade to do a low level job while these third world imports get high level jobs and live in condos?This whole event changed my world and life. Like those sheep at CHC  I was in rude awakening  it took me time to reflect all these years of blind faith and voting PAP  the trusted brand which keeps saying  ”With you  for you” every GE and leave no one behind. I applied for jobs  most middle level jobs  you have at least 500 – 1500 applicants  many are foreigners  fighting for one vacancy. So I finally know what is like to be unemployed  I could not imagine how these foreigners are all here competing with locals.This election  I turned against PAP  the reason is obvious. After many decades of voting PAP  this is my first time voting WP. I had blindly trusted PAP for too long  too comfortable with my good job and pay. I never really believed this 6.9M or 10M is going to affect me. Now I had to caution all the local PMETs reading this to forward to all other PMETs who maybe sleeping or used to having blind faith like me. If we do not stand up to PAP earlier  eventually we will be hit or our next generations will be hit.The MSM largely avoided the harsh truths of why voters are turning against PAP  they are skirting answers because they want to keep us dumb. I only changed my vote after I was hit. I agreed with most of the reasons listed by Seng Kang voter  he got it right. I am one of the blind faith and I know many of us are fearful of repercussion or change.Will PAP change? Honestly  it will not  unless someone new is going to take over and overhaul the system. The plan for 6.9M is certainly on  I believe they will pretend to listen but will still do the same. So the Seng Kang voter is right  we expect them to continue to import more foreigners and convert  redrawing boundaries  more CPF changes and blood sucking policies.I had trusted them for far too long  and I am asking all of you who have not woken up to start thinking and till the next GE  we should all go out and vote oppositions to stop them from destroying our lives and country our forefathers built. Remember these foreigners did not build this country  they came,btohqsg
in on VIP tickets  our lunches are served on them. So for the sake of our future and next generation  we need to vote more oppositions or end up like me.Ricky Seow￼ Posted,btohqsg
Problem in such messages is authenticity and vice versa,btohqsg
Some small mistakes that PAP made are too blown out of proportion,btohqsg
The issue is more onare Singaporeans consistent in1) Verifying news2) Treating PAP and WP as equals,btohqsg
And when WP (now the opposition leader) speaks   do they tell the whole truth?Same as PAP  what the truth is?If one doubt PAP  one must put the same doubt to WP.Must be fair and just,btohqsg
Like the Town council issueIf the one who was found corrupted in Town Council issues is to be jailed  it must be for both parties!Same for WP and same for PAP,btohqsg
I wish to see the same for all wards and political parties,btohqsg
I already touched on pt2  pap and oppo are not fighting on equal terms  oppo is far too disadvantaged,btohqsg
You want to talk about fair and just  then go tell pap to make the playing field fair and just first,btohqsg
Can u share what is unfair,btohqsg
I would like to know too,btohqsg
What is unfair is so widespread and in so many areas  impossible for me to answer in an open manner  for specific area we can discuss further. In a general way I already pointed out that pap is the gov and they have all the power and resources  oppo do not have such power and resources,btohqsg
For example  talk about the election  the oppo is so disadvantaged in many ways  if you cannot see it then I really dont know what to say,btohqsg
Like that i can also sayIt is so unfair! WP can get away with whatever they had done wrong but I can’t tell you in the open.Come on! Be open and say the truth. If you believe it is the truth.Since you had said  PAP had been unfair now. You can state the examples,btohqsg
That is what I feel the games played by oppositions,btohqsg
If it is the truth  say it! Show it and prove it!Be courageous,btohqsg
POFMA is when it is not the truth! If it is the truth  you won’t kenna POFMA,btohqsg
As far the election  the election dept is reporting to PM  the constituency boundaries are changed without reason and so late notice  timing of when the election is called  the short campaign period 9 days  all these and much more are obvious to the oppo disadvantage.  I dont think you are sincere in discussing what is fair to the oppo  I shall not waste further time,btohqsg
All these are not anything new  they have been talked about for years and years  yet you can claim ignorance  obviously you are not sincere in wanting to talk about what is fair to the oppo,btohqsg
"The onlinecitizen has an article ""Singapore elections are not fair  say ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights"" published 20 june 2020",btohqsg
Do a search and there is so much info on the unfair election process  so I dont believe you have no knowledge of all these,btohqsg
Actually I feel the ELD should be independent and consists of past politicians  current political lawyers  businessmen,btohqsg
Should not be affiliated to any one party,btohqsg
Or take instructions from people affiliated to any party,btohqsg
A person skilled in urban planning should lead the ELD,btohqsg
Omg you don’t know what are unfair and what are not on fair grounds ?,btohqsg
That’s explained the disconnect with the general population,btohqsg
The point WP made is that ministers salary should not have such a high variable bonus according to the growth of the economy  as it incentivises to a growth at all cost mentality. Politicians should be paid according to civil servant pay grades. This would have the side effect of ensuring that civil servant pay is updated regularly.,btohqsg
If you read their manifesto you would know their business friendly proposals  like incentives for companies who hire more Singaporeans than necessary for quota  subsidised rent on JTC and HDB properties  requiring interest on late payments by Govt to vendors  and abolishing retirement age.,btohqsg
lets discuss nicely..i believe both side must try to see the others' to avoid bubble and groupthink alsoPAP supporters must understand their side is not 100% right  and have to accept different ideasOpposition supporters have to understand PAP is not bad at all too  a lot of good men there...both bubbles must burst 😁,btohqsg
I also concur with HK's situation. I am earning 5 figure up to last year. Got laid off last year and approached SGUnited (or another related agency...cannot remember because their inter-structure is quite completed). Had one session with them and that is it. Gave me 3 resume samples and told me to be more active in LinkedIn to have higher chance of headhunter seeing my CV. That's it!!! Then this agency presumably get that commission from the govt. When I asked about jobs  they say can browse thru MyCareersFuture and look myself. Damn! Total waste of my time. Recently checked on my ex company  all the management level is foreigners  not a single local. Not sure how they managed to do it. All I know is that if they have a foreigner candidate already in the past they will still do the mandatory posting but will say no suitable candidates and then employ their own people.,btohqsg
or they ask u go e2i to upgrade ur skills lor  take course training etc...,btohqsg
From dishwasher.Upgrade skills to become Cleaner lol.,btohqsg
Yo guys  wanna ask  when can we get workfare $? Issit on 22?,btohqsg
