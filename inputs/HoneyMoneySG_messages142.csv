Anyone receive coupon travel and oversea charge redemption promotion from Maybank?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI am not too clear regarding the promo mechanics. Does it mean for the highest tier of this promo: we transfer in $150 000  buy for example Fullerton SGD cash fund  Moomoo then gives us 1.8% cashback of $120k for first 30 days and then another 1.8% cashback of $120k for second 30 days ?,btohqsg
Anyone know for UOB Lady’s cc  to qualify for 6mpd with the funds inside its savings account  how long does the fund need to be inside the account?,btohqsg
it is based on monthly average balance,btohqsg
Could you technically just put the funds for a few days (before end of statement month  or point of transaction  not sure which),btohqsg
Can  if ur monthly average balance is above 10k.,btohqsg
yes so long monthly average balance in the calendar month is min 10k. For example  if in a 30 day month  u can put300k for 1day150k for 2 days100k for 3 days etc,btohqsg
I see thanks everyone! Would u guys happen to know if this is valid if one just newly opened the account (haven’t reach 30 days),btohqsg
in the first month  the monthly average balance is sum of balance from day account open divided by number of days in momth from day open. So technically if open on last day of month  just need to put 10k on last day to get extra 2mpd.,btohqsg
Have a look at uob official faq. They have good example.https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/lsa-faq.pdf,btohqsg
Hi which savings account is recommended for fresh grads,btohqsg
Ahh I should’ve opened a bit later,btohqsg

Hello  expert. I’d like to ask about the maximum cashback for the first month with the 15% cashback on preferred categories  offered by the TRUST Cashback Credit Card  with no minimum spend,btohqsg
U need to spend over 3 months,btohqsg
Actually same question! What do they mean by ‘No min spend is required for first month.’? Does that mean in Dec and Jan I just have to spend min 500 each to qualify for the 5% cash back? Cashback for the quarter given at the end (I forgot what I read for this 😅)?,btohqsg
But for the first calendar month the minimum spend is waived right,btohqsg
yeah thats what i understood too. that means we gotta hit min 500 in oct and nov to get the 5%. and okay i checked — it says bonus cashback every quarteri read ontrust cashback siteandmilelion,btohqsg

Strange. How come can have giro setup so fast? It is less than 2 months. Very unlikely it is fully setup.,btohqsg
Usually it is 3-4 months. If you are lucky  need 2 months.,btohqsg
Setup needs both side. HSBC only can tell your their side  not uob side.,btohqsg
If it shows GIRO PAYMENT  it means fully setup already,btohqsg

Amaze is calendar month  Citi rewards is statement month. Let's say ur citi statement is 10th. 1-10 you hit 1k and cap amaze. After 10th  you can still use ur citi rewards but crmc + amaze will be charged 1%.,btohqsg
Hmm~ I called citi bank and then they say my amaze linked to citi rewards on my Tsui Wah dining via kris pay not eligible for 4mpd on their back end?,btohqsg
What is the reasoning? Not online?,btohqsg
She says amaze is mobile wallet top up,btohqsg
I asked is she based in Sg or Philippines … maybe she is not familiar with amaze in SG,btohqsg
I have a feeling it's more krispay.,btohqsg
What is the mcc code if you check via Amaze apps now?,btohqsg
Have you hit $1k max on Citi rewards statement month?,btohqsg
Nope. I just sign this card. Trying to clock the $500 sing saver spending,btohqsg
I used to use Google pay + Kris pay + crmc before and it was fine.I did recall apple pay version has issue.,btohqsg

Sorry Anthony do you mean we could actually clock 2k in that sense please?,btohqsg

If for some reason you haven't hit BHS  you can do VCMA to top-up your MA. You can also top-up to spouse account if they haven't hit FRS.,btohqsg

Thank you  assume you are using also. So far so good for you in term of connection?,btohqsg
It's on SingTel's network so definitely the best in coverage.,btohqsg
it is 1k local spend in calendar month for amaze+card before incurring 1% fee  1k cap for 4mpd in statement month for crmc,btohqsg

yes correct. minimum 1k localspend to trigger the 4mpd.electronic is fine as long as the merchant don’t categorise its mcc as general exclusion mcc.,btohqsg

If u using iPhone you need turn off the iMessage auto message when u plug in ur SIM card. Otp won’t get any charges but iMessage will .Kanna when I’m in Japan and that’s what M1 told me. Not sure about SingTel,btohqsg
Turning off iMessage will get charge for theoutgoingoverseas message. Same for turning it back on. Applies to any other services provided by iOS.,btohqsg
Yeahhh so best is to disable it first before gg overseas. But idk how,btohqsg
Nope. You will still get charged. Because you're sending the message to UK. The system is really old and stupid.,btohqsg
So for iPhone users how do we avoid it? eSIM? And don’t plug in/out ur card?I only get that notification when I change my sim card,btohqsg
Find out about the 18 cent charge  pay and live with it. Or use an Android phone instead?P.S. now it's 30 cents.,btohqsg
When comparing different banks  is there a rank order from best to least if accruing points for Krisflyer transfer?Example:1. Citi Miles don’t expire so best and more airline redemption options2 . UOB UNI $ is pooled across cards but issue is $5 rounding3. DBS miles expire at a faster rate4. OCBC has min. redemption of 20K miles at a time5. Krisflyer Amex auto transfers without fees each monthRoughly something like this? I know a tough question to answer but general guidance would be appreciated. 🙏,btohqsg
However  if you do need to make such roaming sms  please check out the rates below.If you are in Malaysia & Brunei:✅ Incoming SMS - Not chargeable✅ Outgoing SMS - $0.40 per SMSIf you are in any countries outside of Singapore  except Malaysia & Brunei:✅ Incoming SMS - Not chargeable✅ Outgoing SMS: $1.00 per SMSThe above info got from zym customer service,btohqsg
U mention krisflyer transfer liao so why more airline partner matter to u lol,btohqsg
AMEX got promotion now. Spend $1000 within 30 days of approval  free 17K miles,btohqsg
But beyond that  1.1mpd  which is not attractive. Can consider get another one after getting the 17K miles. Like Standard Chartered Journey (the old X card from SC)/UOBKF/DBS Altitude/Citi Premiermiles (Also promo till Feb  if u pay annual fee  u get 30K miles jus by spending $800 within first 2 mths),btohqsg
Or use Giga. Can only receive cannot send when overseas 😬,btohqsg
It's not about sending when overseas  it's about sending to overseas numbers,btohqsg

"Yes. Yes. If you used Amaze with CRMC  amaze will not ""refund"" the $50 spend.",btohqsg
Do we earn 1% cashback for all overseas spend or need to hit minimum amt per quarter for Trust cashback card?,btohqsg
Ah thanks! Can I clarify what you mean when you say amaze will not refund the $50 spend?,btohqsg
The refunded txn still takes up the $1000 limit,btohqsg
Hi all  I need some advise.. I apply the Citibank card but I didn’t received the application number so how do I fill up the singsaver redemption form? Any idea. TIA 🙏,btohqsg

Immediate cashback? Only selected category need to wait quaterly?,btohqsg

hi  dbs digibot on dbs ibanking not responding when I clicked on it. Same for u guys?,btohqsg
Yes agree  my bad  though which do you think is ideal?Reason I ask is I find DBS expires much faster and UOB lady’s and visa signature for fx and uob ppv has been the best so far compared to any other banks  but not sure if I am missing something,btohqsg
1. American Express Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer2. DBS Altitude3. Citi Premier MilesCurrently on promotion. See which one u prefer. Can google and take a look. Since Citi is until Feb  and AMEX ends around Dec 2024. U can apply AMEX first  then once u receive the 17K miles  u apply Citi. DBS's one i'm not sure when the promo ends  so u can time ur applications to get the most out of ur miles. So i would say  no rank to it  just which card got promo  just faster grab,btohqsg
Use sian already  cancel and get a new miles card with new promo. If u scared ur rating drop  well  my wife has like 4-5 cc  she is still AA  or u can pay $8 for Credit Bureau report to check ur rating 👍🏻,btohqsg

Thanks  I have added to apple pay. In this case is it better to pay by linking f&f to amaze? Or directly using f&f?,btohqsg
Hard to say  depends on your use case. For example  if u are overseas in countries other than malaysia and indonesia  you can use amaze with f&f for dining to get 8% and avoid the fx fees.I dont have amaze anyway  maybe those with amaze can answer this question better.,btohqsg
Hi all  for overseas cards to use in Vietnam  which of the few would you all recommend? Between Amaze  YouTrip  Trust  Revolut and Wise? thank you,btohqsg

This is why you should always keep your credit limits as high as possible with a bank and don’t cancel your cards. Once in a while u get superb offers like this. 2.38% pa reducing balance balance transfer is well  great?,btohqsg
Price there doesn't include tax. It will be added later when checking out.For card  I guess UOB KF or Citi smrt. Depends on you like cashback or miles.,btohqsg

Hi anyone tried vivifi or eight mobile? Which has better coverage?,btohqsg
Vivifi is singtel based while eight is star hub based. Coverage should be similar to respective network.What is ur current phone plan?,btohqsg
This is a no brainer to apply right? Can easily get 4% from high yield saving accounts... Btw the T&Cs stated if we repay early  will still be liable for the full interest... But I don't think HYSA interest rates will suddenly drop below 2.38% so can still arbitrage a little here.,btohqsg
1. exactly.. that is why i said this is a great benefit.. better than any sign up bonus for sure.2. no.. this is REDUCING BALANCE.. so the moment you repay (early)  the 2.38% p.a. interest STOPS accruingvs a FEE balance transfer (this is lousier),btohqsg
for a $100k balance transfer at 2.38% put into HSBC EGA...HSBC EGA 4.1% for 6 months = $2 050Maybank 2.38% BT for 6 months = $1 190PROFIT = $860 for 6 monthsDon't even need any spending.*figures are simplified,btohqsg

Hi Expert  can I say that if I don't have 150k park under UOB ONe  it will be better if I park the amount in the HSBCEGA on December because I can get higher interest rateBelow are the info I got from UOBMaximum effective interest rate (EIR) on the One Account is 0.65% p.a. for deposits of S$75 000  provided customers meet criterion of S$500 eligible card spend in each calendar month.Below are the HSBC EGAIncremental ADB that will earn bonus interest > 3%And for January maybe I will take out the money from HSBC and park to UOB while try to spend 500 sgd again and on Feb park to HSBC EGA again.Any advice are welcome :D,btohqsg
Just to confirm  you have about 75k?,btohqsg
Uob need both $150k and plunging chicken promo to win HSBC EGA,btohqsg
Now you got me interested in the plunging chicken promotion. Is it the save up promo?,btohqsg
It’s 3% for 75k  where did you see 0.65%?,btohqsg
Oh so it’s 3% and the 0.65 is from the website.In this case the different will be spending 500 in credit card,btohqsg

Good morning gurus  I have looked through the chats but still have a query. I am planning to go jb decathlon to get some stuffs. I understand that to earn miles  I should use amaze card which is tag to my crmc in Malaysia. I understand that amaze would change it to an online purchase as well as reducing the fcy. Could I ask is it I should just scan my amaze card through Google Pay in the shop please? Thank you so much.,btohqsg
Should be ok. I'd bring the card anyway.,btohqsg
My bad could I check if you mean the amaze card please? Sorry if it is a dumb question.,btohqsg

the gurus please correct my understanding if im wrong as well. I think citibank restricts any paywave for any category for miles accumulation. So  yes best to bring the amaze card but you can leave it crmc card at home.Ref:https://milelion.com/2024/05/14/psa-dont-use-citi-rewards-card-with-mobile-wallets/,btohqsg
Not correct. Paywave is fine for certain offline MCCs. Point 6.https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/citi-rewards-card/pdf/10x-rewards-promotion-terms-and-conditions-2020.pdf,btohqsg

Sorry I mean have to ensure SAL cat is fulfilled plus the min 200k together to achieve the 4+% interest,btohqsg
You only need sal and 500 increase to hit 4% at 100k in ocbc 360. At 200k  eir is actually lower than 4%.,btohqsg
200k is not worth. Better to put the extra 100k in other investment,btohqsg
200k has horrible EIR. Barely 3%+ p.a. only.,btohqsg

Hitting 10k monthly interest is actually possible with leverage.,btohqsg
Try to hit 500k AUM with UOB. Then will unlock portfolio financing. With 500k u can draw down 1mil funding. Can use to put into investment products.Imagine 1.5mil u throw inside 6%. U already earning 90k interest PA liao,btohqsg
Whats the cost of financing the 1mil?,btohqsg
The concept is good. But the choice of asset also important. Funds are not principal protected.,btohqsg
Lol. Not sure u know what is margin call or not. Just small fluctuations then you hit with it when u all in with margin.Plus you didn't factor in the cost of financing.It is workable but you mush have cash ready to cover the margin call possibility if in risk standpoint. Plus also too much concentration risk on the fund manager.The max risk is bigger than you think.It is not financial advice.,btohqsg
Do you mean with $500k AUM in UOB  UOB is willing to lend you another $1mil to put it in investment or unit trust? Then what is the interest charges?,btohqsg
5262 should be eligible for HSBC live+ no?,btohqsg

think stack is not an appropriate word to use here,btohqsg
whats dp  so you use Apple Pay to pay thru the Kris+ paymentAnd you use DBS WWMC to pair with your amaze card  so the Apple pay is transacting on the amaz card  and ultimiately the DBS WWMCerm but DBS WWMC already is eligible for online transation Kris+ recog the wwmc as online right?So anyway what extra mile u get ah,btohqsg
Wwmc cannot pair with Amaze  DBS nerfed it already. Yes  there’s no need to pair with Amaze if using on Kris+ because it’s already online.,btohqsg
Yes jasmine I did!!!! It’s working,btohqsg
Oops! Use it with might be a better phrase,btohqsg
hi all  i am new to SNACK  I can't seem to add credit card while redeeming the products (e.g. life  accident)  anyone can teach how to proceed?,btohqsg
To put things simple Link ur DBS wwmc and Amaze to ur mobile wallet.Use either one with kris+.But since u are gg to buy a Mac book  just use DBS wwmc since u can hit the miles in $1.5kAmaze + citi is only capped at 1k and also note that if u didn’t change ur citi to calander month  ur amaze local spending cap and Citi cap might be different,btohqsg

Yes  $300 from Apple but it has since be credited further up in the statement. Transactions in the app also doesn’t reflect this $280.84,btohqsg
any fees of 19.16 alongside this refund?,btohqsg
if ur statement doesn’t add up  contact the bank… how u expect strangers with no access to ur statements or txns to help 🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
Do you know what the “payment received” at the end meant  despite me not making payment?Or have you experienced this before?,btohqsg
You probably want to check with the bank on the transaction.,btohqsg
it’s just a general term for any credit received during the month. it may reflect refunds  reversals or whatever adjustments made by the bank,btohqsg

I see  will check with them if card is possible. But in the event if card is not possible. Do you think Amaze or Big pay would be a better option ?,btohqsg
Just work around it with dbs bill payment?,btohqsg
So there is no need to use amaze+crmc for kris+  am I right?,btohqsg
You can’t use CRMC directly in Kris+ because Citi exclude in-app payments from earning 10x. In order to by-pass that  have to pair with Amaze.,btohqsg
Dont forget to default amaze in gpay too,btohqsg
On this note  its more important that spending are within 1k of amaze calendar month? Even if crmc statement month is different?,btohqsg
Yup. Keep amaze within 1k to avoid 1% charge in a calender month.,btohqsg
ideally within Amaze 1k in calendar month and within crmc 1k in statement month  if can pay directly using crmc (online that is non mobile in-app or offline fashion) should do so,btohqsg

hihi anyone knows if altitude card is based on trx / posting date? tia! for the 5mpd,btohqsg
not true  read the relevant clause,btohqsg
16. The calculation of Minimum Spend Requirement and Eligible Spend is based on the transaction date of the retail spend charged to the Card Account.,btohqsg
If we pair CRMC and May Bank F&F cards with Amaze and pay by Amaze  how do we know which card the payment will be charged to? Thanks,btohqsg
u choose the card in instarem app  before making payment,btohqsg
For example  if I want to use Maybank F&F to pay instead of CRMC  I amend the “change source “in the Instarem app to Maybank F&F?,btohqsg
Hi guys  new to CCs. Citi jus called me and ask if want to do some installment-based payment for my new crmc.Any benefits of doing this  or should I just stick to normal monthly full payment?,btohqsg
Usually instalment will not give u any rewards.,btohqsg
Ah ic  so it's a trap 😅,btohqsg
are they asking you to take a loan?,btohqsg
I don't think so  mainly paying off credit in installments (they mentioned smth about credit limit etc),btohqsg
what's the best credit card to use for spending in JB?,btohqsg
Maybank fnf (up to 312.5) or trust card imo (for cashback),btohqsg
For investment platforms like webull and tiger  do their new users promo apply to those who closed their accounts before? Similar to cc promos?,btohqsg
It doesn't have a clause that says it excludes those who have cancelled an account within x months like cc.That's why i'm wondering if anyone is doing or has done this before,btohqsg

"Hi  has anyone tried the ""transfer points option"" for the Standard Chartered Journey card? Can you transfer down to the last points or only in 100k denomination?""You can now transfer 360° Rewards Points to your preferred nominee(S) whom holds a valid Standard Chartered Credit Card(s). A fee of S$10 will be charged for every 100 000 of 360° Rewards Points transferred to a nominee’s credit card account.

Anyone knows for DBS WWMC  when the app says expiring on Dec 2024  does it mean- start of month (1 Dec 2024)- end of month (31 Dec 2024)?,btohqsg
Can anyone suggest me which one of the following bank accounts is the best for me? I want to save money plus earning cash back via credit card but not to pay any annual fees.Here are 5 bank accounts that I’m interesting in:1. Citi MaxiGain.2. Standard Chartered Bonus$aver.3. DBS/POSB Multiplier.4. Citi Interest Booster (Citi Plus).5. HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
Cashback on credit card without AF has nothing to do with saving account thou,btohqsg
How much are you planning to park in the accounts? Are you saving additional amounts every month? Are you willing to change your credit card strategy if the bank account requires it?,btohqsg
Let’s say that I will save approximately 2000 a month  my spendings will be at least 600.I saw that with Citi Plus you can earn cash back with their CashBack+ credit card  but I don’t think that it’s the best way to grow money.,btohqsg
So which card is the best? Like for me if my spendings will be 600$ a month?I’m usually spending money on transportation  groceries and clothes,btohqsg
So it's not saving 2000 but saving 1400? And you only answered 1 out of 3 qns.,btohqsg
Well my salary will be around 5500  I’ll save approximately 1700 a month after spending on rent and 600$ on shopping (transportation  groceries  clothes etc).,btohqsg
Every month I’ll park 1700$ (salary-spendings).,btohqsg
For ur case  conventional choice is uob one acct + uob one cc or ocbc 360 acct + ocbc cashback cc.Any reason for not considering those?,btohqsg
