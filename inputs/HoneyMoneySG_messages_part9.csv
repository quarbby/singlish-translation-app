I would say telco bills  dining  retail  petrol and groceries comprises most of my monthly spendings. Planing to use card up to use tax  insurance and parking as well,btohqsg
Hmm i have a frank debit card which i am considering to frank credit card but the cashback feels like too general 😅 correct me if im wrong 🙏🏽,btohqsg
Zar i just make my payment using uob + grabpay yesterday for insurance,btohqsg
On topic of petrol for those who ride or drive  where do you pump at and why,btohqsg
I'll start with myself - sinopec,btohqsg
Hahaha. Same2. I recently too did some research and got to know the benefits of credit cards. And i too agree on the financial control which ultimately leads to financial freedom,btohqsg
Oh wow. Did u get better rewards that way?,btohqsg
For sinopec only Bukit Timah one is 24% everyday,btohqsg
Hows the quality? Run further miles etc?,btohqsg
Im currently on Shell. Rider card 14% upfront. Hence thinking of using CC now 😅,btohqsg
Use credit top up to grab pay(get cash back) then grab to pay to insurance (get grabpay rewards),btohqsg
Ahh icic but is there still cashback for grabpay topup? I heard recently they stopped,btohqsg
Pay insurance got grab pay rewards?,btohqsg
Only uob absolute amex and amex tcb can,btohqsg
No points for insurance  mine is prudential ipay. Got points for ntuc membership,btohqsg
I did my mortgage insurance last mth with my partner  cannot leh,btohqsg
The call operator say de. I did before paying. I can raise issue if never credit in. Cover myself haha,btohqsg
Telco  dining   groceries can use Maybank Familiy and FriendsRetail use general paywave card or mall vouchersPetrol go with the bank that gives you more discount (drivers pls advise),btohqsg
Haven't explored since no mortgage yet,btohqsg
Compare mortgage insurance to term insurance cost and benefit. Ultimately it is to pay up the mortgage if something unfortunate hapoen to you/owner of the property. If term coverage can cover the mortgage then why still need mortgage insurance? Something to think aboutDidclaimer: i havent research on such things yet  so take it as pinch of salt,btohqsg
Ahh icic. Then in a way 365 would kind of suit me better since i dont hit the 2k/monthly spendings 😅,btohqsg
Well  but u can hit 1k in spending which is 3.33% + 5% additional,btohqsg
Ahh icic. Thanks for the advice 🙏🏽,btohqsg
