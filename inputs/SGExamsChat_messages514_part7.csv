I put WiFi it's a nightmare,btohqsg
Yeah there's a fine line between the Madagascar cockroaches and the normal house ones,btohqsg
U show us your doorframe for what,btohqsg
yes the house ones are best to be eliminated,btohqsg
But the ones as pets are honestly clean as a whistle,btohqsg
I don't see a termite infestation in that photo,btohqsg
We got rid of it alr,btohqsg
Donâ€™t know spray bygone how many times,btohqsg
Walao it's like u bring me to the beach where sook ching occurred then tell me to just think of the past,btohqsg
But you can see the damage the termites did,btohqsg
You wanna see damage? Just look at any satellite photos of Nevada,btohqsg
Yes each hole is a nuke tested,btohqsg
ngl looks like my skin during puberty,btohqsg
The funny part about it was it was so common it was normalised,btohqsg
Be like hey honey why is our house destroyed again?Oh don't worry the government is just testing another bomb,btohqsg
u know how for O level e math there's the distance speed time chapter,btohqsg
if i use physics concepts to solve should is can or cannot,btohqsg
apparently I heard need to use their special method or they won't score you if use physics,btohqsg
dw i know what you mean,btohqsg
apparently need to use coordinate geometry to solve,btohqsg
cos the method I use is from physics and apparently it might not be fair to other students who don't take physics so much use coordinate geometry to solve or they won't award marks,btohqsg
you mean the maths method is this?,btohqsg
it could be a form of brute forcing answers,btohqsg
my maths teacher back in sec school did not allow it,btohqsg
cause you are getting answers without the correct method,btohqsg
so without the correct method  there is no method mark...and usually these qns if not in multiple choices will yield no mark,btohqsg
some teachers wont view it the same thing  and it sucks,btohqsg
ya heard so from my friend also,btohqsg
but for O level will they accept or not,btohqsg
Btw idk is it me but those lines dont look straight,btohqsg
confirm shitty resolution when they print,btohqsg
hold on  ill pull up the o level marking scheme for you,btohqsg
ok eg. this qns from nov 2022 o levels paper,btohqsg
your teacher is just being infurating,btohqsg
these type of teacher do nitpicking,btohqsg
is another fella say his cher don't accept,btohqsg
i mean its not like super scientific etc,btohqsg
its still very relevant to maths,btohqsg
that's why I shocked when he say won't be accepted during o level,btohqsg
cos end of the day  it's still mathematical understanding,btohqsg
i had a classmate decided to use his graviational potential energy knowledge on a maths question asking for speed of a rollercoaster,btohqsg
just noting the fact some people like to use knowledge gained from other subjects on unrelevant subject papers,btohqsg
I ever taught a student tip to tail method because I don't like parallelogram method.He used in exams perfectly. His teacher gave zero marks because hasn't teach in school,btohqsg
cos this one is finding average speed which is total distance over total time.,btohqsg
this one is speed divide deceleration = time,btohqsg
so this formula will get M1 anot,btohqsg
school nevermind. I understand chers got their own marking style but I asking whether O level will accept such physics concepts/formulas that math classes won't teach,btohqsg
The request lor its a one off thing rite,btohqsg
i was so lazy to go camp today,btohqsg
yes bro all part of the plan,btohqsg
