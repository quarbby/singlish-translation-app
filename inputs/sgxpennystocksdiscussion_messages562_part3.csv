"Nasdaq YQ is going to move above USD 1🚀🌱Interesting Facts🌱Founded in 2012  $17 Education & Technology(YQ.US)$ provides a smart in-school classroom solution that delivers data-driven teaching  learning  and assessment products to teachers  students  and parents across over 70 000 K12 schools. It claims to have covered 56% of the primary schools  60% of the middle schools  and 7% of the high schools in China in the first half of 2020.Their online services represented 30.2%  88.5%  and 93.0% of its total net revenues in 2018  2019  and the nine months ended September 30  2020  respectively.Support independent journalism.The company claims it has serviced over 900 000 teachers  54.3 million students  and 45.2 million parents as registered users on a cumulative basis.Proceeds from the IPO  in January 2021  will be used to improve its after-school tutoring services and student learning experience operations  as well as enhance the product offerings and educational content of their smart in-school classroom solution. It will also invest in technology infrastructure and its sales  marketing  and brand promotional activities  according to the filing.In 2018  the company raised US$250 million in a series E round led by Temasek Holdings. It’s also backed by Tiger Global  Shunwei Capital  and DST Global  among others.After Government Crackdown  What’s Next for China’s Edtech Firms?With new regulations hitting hard at home  China’s education firms are going global.""The implementation of the regulation on education supervision  along with other measures recently introduced  shows that the government is serious about pushing 'double reduction' policies  which have been talked about for a few years "" Li Yanjie  a teacher at a high school in Fengtai district  told the Global Times.Li said she is glad to see the policies taking effect from a teacher's perspective. ""It is time to draw the attention of teachers  students and parents back to the classrooms  where the 'teaching and learning' should really be happening "" she said.From May to July  education inspectors have conducted supervision in about 248 000 schools at all levels in China.The business-to-government path within China is also interesting for a growing number of firms. This is a large  untapped  and still unregulated market that involves selling directly to public schools  whose budgets are often controlled by their local governments. With governments at all levels putting more pressure on public schools to fill the gap the regulations are creating in the after-school market  public schools will need to develop capacity in IT services  curriculum design  and sheer workforce.The new regulations actually provide more opportunities as schools will need more excellent content  which requires the assistance from $17 Education & Technology(YQ.US)$.Experimental schools  which have more leeway and autonomy in their budgets  may be a good entry point for companies interested in developing their business-to-government revenues. The key question  however  will be how much local governments and public schools are willing to pay  and charge their students  for these services.Despite stringent regulations that have damaged many edtech firms in the market  a sizable number of companies see opportunities for product development. Many are reorienting their customer acquisition strategies through different channels or markets and offering more innovative products. The regulations ousted the newest entrants  but edtech’s largest players may well be poised for the sustainable growth that had eluded them.",btohqsg

"✈️Pika World Update- Oct 27 2021✈️🪜General Electric: Pushing Ahead in Tough Days🪜The stock was firm despite giving guidance that was less than expected. Adjusted earnings per share stood at $0.57  ahead of Wall Street's estimate of $0.43. However  sales looked slightly weak  and the guide spoke a similar tune. The company predicted a flat year of year growth in sales.Despite less revenue  it has maintained positive free cash flow  which is a bright note. The CEO does sound upbeat as it signals growth in orders and margins expansion. Despite a challenging operating environment  the company seems to do well with selling non-critical assets to power its turnaround story.Pika World has not initiated any position.🧨Intel: Entering Yet another Rough Patch🥊Analysts aren't that happy with Intel performance  and the recent downgrade reflects a more muted future as the company seeks to upsize its competitiveness again. In addition  under the new CEO  there has been a concrete plan to gain market share from AMD.A key concern is the spending needed to achieve this reality. The capital expenditure is likely to hit up to $28 billion next year. Furthermore  an annual compound growth rate of 10%-12% seems a stretch for the company. In addition  the company is expected to see a prolonged period of depressed Free Cashflow while waiting for earnings to recover. This may spell weakness in dividend pay-out in the medium term.Pika World does not have a position in Intel but has been accumulating AMD since the Sept downturn. Nevertheless  we maintain our exposure to the sector.🌭Beyond Meat: Help ""Me""🫕A downgrade on the company isn't uncommon  and this time around  the reason spells trouble. Credit Suisse believed that the market is near saturation.While the alternative meat category does have room for growth  analysts do not see Beyond Meat growing its market share. Adding fuel is the warning to investors that delta variant is hurting its revenue and resulting in a weak execution in distribution which is likely to hit hard to the topline.💻Alphabet: Blast Through Estimates🕹A sound set of earnings results that exceeds expectations on multiple fronts. Net income and revenue all hit estimates  although stocks were down in the after-hours. There is an excellent growing vibe as the CEO focus on the company's narrative in becoming an AI focus company.The bright spot comes in Google Cloud  where revenue jumped 45% to hit $4.99 billion. What is exciting is the improvement in Search and the launch of Pixel 6 to create an enduring ecosystem.Pika World had initiated a short-term position in the company and is expected to pare down the position. However  Pika World maintains a best-in-class rating for the company.📮What's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive Core Durable Goods Order which we expect to grow at 0.4% compared to 0.3% in the prior period. In essence  a higher reading reflects healthy manufacturing activity  which is a positive for economic growth.Crude Oil Inventories data will be out at 10.30 pm  and we expect a positive level of 1.65M  a jump from -0.431M in the previous period.It is Oct 27  Wednesday  7.50 am in Singapore and 7.50 pm in New York. A roller coaster rush week indeed. Nonetheless  Pika World will be with you to ride the next wave.",btohqsg
