Hi all  for setting up cardup to pay for insurance like prudential  how to prevent double charge as I need to have existing recurring payment method?Is it set up the cardup to pay at least 1 day earlier than my current arrangement with the same credit card?,btohqsg
Those food delivery apps provided you have China numbers to use. I use roaming data over there.,btohqsg
Ahh sounds good! Thanks for the tip to bring cash,btohqsg
oh mine no issue tho  i just log in with wechat  but hit or miss,btohqsg
Ohh WeChat doesn‚Äôt have 3% fees?,btohqsg
oh both have 3% fees but i just feel alipay more strsightforward cuz the pay logo right at the home page,btohqsg
Some vouchers will require to sent notifications to a number and it must be a China number. There is one time I wanted to use Luckin coffee voucher but they need a China number to receive notification. Give up and bought the more expensive Starbucks coffee.,btohqsg
Agreed Alipay is better. WeChat pay is for standby only.,btohqsg
ah yes  i had the luckin staff help me to buy on her phone and i wechat her the money ü§£ and they get more discounts too with chinese number,btohqsg
but rlly convenient compared to paynow/paylah  rather have alipay in sg üòÖ,btohqsg
If in Shanghai  buy the 3 day pass at the metro station at the airport itself.  For Shenzhen  we flew to Hong Kong and took ferry there,btohqsg
standby wechat pay if u wan to pay street vendors as they will usually whip out their phone for you to pay direct to their wechat acc  didnt try if it works using alipay though,btohqsg
just curious  i tried using wechat paired w my CC in singapore  but it doesnt seems to work when i ask the Scarlet Supermarket cashier to scan my QR code.am i pairing it wrong?,btohqsg
ele.meÈ•ø‰∫Ü‰πà can be used for food delivery if u r using sg number,btohqsg
Am heading to Guangzhou  any tips for travels within this would be great too!,btohqsg
thrs prepaid transit card on apple wallet if ure using iphone if u prefer not having to open close the alipay transport option cuz might fumble if ure right at the tap in n tap out so best to prep beforehand,btohqsg
i think wechat doesnt work in sg linked to ccüòÖ only chinese bank acc  tried in daiso previously doesnt work as well,btohqsg
Have this same issue with Alipay in Singapore  I can‚Äôt seem to scan any QR in Hawker Centers  is it the same for the rest ?,btohqsg
maybe targeted at foreigners as thats their main form of payment  i didnt change any cash and went empty handed,btohqsg
Wechat Pay outside of chinese mainland only works for Chinese nationals,btohqsg
oh then does alipay work in sg?i am travelling to shanghai end of year  i dont wanna be caught blind sided if the payment method dont work,btohqsg
The error will clearly say overseas payment for China mainland real name verified users only,btohqsg
Bring cash if you scared lor,btohqsg
alipay doesnt work in sg as well but so far ill say most likely if no technical issues it shd work in china,btohqsg
So unless you have a mainland IC and mainland union pay card no Alipay or weixin outside china,btohqsg
do they still accept cash? i keep hearing that they no longer accept cash,btohqsg
wechat/alipay/trip.comhas a prepaid card option under unionpay if u worried the cc link doesnt work,btohqsg
so basically just go to china and it will magically work?haha its my first time so kinda having anxiety over this payment thing,btohqsg
okay i hope smooth trip for me too üòÖ,btohqsg
It is meant for Chinese tourist visiting Singapore. So they don‚Äôt get culture shock of having to use cash?,btohqsg
For Shanghai  I use Alipay with no issue. Just have multiple credit cards linked to it  sometimes credit card companies will overzealous block thinking it is a scam. It happened to me first time in China when I use trust credit card.,btohqsg
okay then i'll just use Alipay with wechat as standby,btohqsg
You can use paylah directly via unionpay qr at malls etc  the street stalls don‚Äôt accept it. Exchange rate was very competitive,btohqsg
wah thanks!! that is also good data!!!,btohqsg
does anyone have issues adding cf card to spaylater?,btohqsg
Buy their 3 day metro pass at the station at airport. You can access city and their interest within with the trains. I never need to take their car,btohqsg
Is it expensive to use didi if there are say 3ppl,btohqsg
anyone know good card to use in indonesia?,btohqsg
3 pax and above just take didi,btohqsg
Use their local gao de taxi  dirt cheap,btohqsg
Thank you both! Appreciative of all these tips üôè,btohqsg
Remember to report last 4 digits of your phone number to the driver,btohqsg
Hi all  eight sim card can work in china shanghai?,btohqsg
Ohh what‚Äôs the purpose of this Chris! Is it some security thing! And what if I don‚Äôt have a china registered phone number!,btohqsg
Verification to the driver to confirm passenger. Register using SG number will do,btohqsg
Hey  I will recommend at least 10 working days. Setting it for payment the day before will almost certainly trigger your giro/card payment.I could be on the cautious side but I have been reliably using CardUp for Prudential for awhile now.,btohqsg
