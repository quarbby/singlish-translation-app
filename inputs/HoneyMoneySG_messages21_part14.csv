Curious about Maybank visa platinum card it say 3.33% so it's it same as uob one method of spending like I need to spend at least $300 for 3 month before I can get 3.33 orExampleIst month $3002nd month $4003rd month I spent $300So I still consider under 3.33% after I spend total$1000?,btohqsg
in your example  you'll get 3.33% for $900 worth of spending. $100 worth of spending will earn 0 rebate,btohqsg
Thinking of getting a bicycle from decathlon but it cost 1.6k any suggestion on how to maximise the duration for payment or cash back,btohqsg
So is like 300 or 1000 tier,btohqsg
Unlike uob one is 500 1000 2000,btohqsg
If I spend 300 I guess I need to stop unless I spent up to 1000 I guessed,btohqsg
yup tiering different for maybank and uob. uob also has the extra cashback for grab/shopee/simplygo etc. which maybank doesnt,btohqsg
Im guessingSpend 500 uob if can 1k then will stopSwitch to Maybank spend 300 stoppedLast HSBC revolution last,btohqsg

Is there any way we can get cashback for ezlink top-ups? Not counting the ezlink top-up promotion ending Dec.https://www.ezlink.com.sg/top-up-via-the-ez-link-app-earn-cashback/,btohqsg
Not sure if this loophole is still open. Route thru GPMC at the GTM ticket machine. You get cashback from topping up GPMC but no Grab points.,btohqsg
I know that Grab killed topping up using ez-link app but not sure about physical machine,btohqsg
Tonight I will talk about UOB Absolute Grabpay nerf and also the opportunity cost consideration,btohqsg

Grb no point one if top up on mrt station,btohqsg
Actual all cc card use top up mrt worn earn points only if tap simply go will earn,btohqsg
To be fair...Grab has no points for pretty much everything.,btohqsg
Unless u use amex top up grab and use grab to pay for mrt card top up at mrt station,btohqsg
My guess is drivers still need to top up their ez link card for paying ERP and carpark fees. Or topping up concession cards.,btohqsg
Ya just for the sake of top up lor jus no points earn,btohqsg
Uob amex> gab> GTM ( 1.7 cash back for now until 15 Jan 23)UOB AMEX > simply go top-upYou got 1.7 cash back from uob,btohqsg
Use Ezlink app got CC rebate,btohqsg
Thanks for the update. UOB absolut does not explicitly exclude any ezlink-related payments. But the ezlink app does not support AMEX. So the question is if any of the ezlink top-up options allows AMEX to be used.,btohqsg
