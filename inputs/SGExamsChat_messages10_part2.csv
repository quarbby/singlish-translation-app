What's the best way to reconcile with a friend after some terrible arguments and quarrels in the past ?,btohqsg

We got some Indian JPJC guy in my squad  fucking autistic,btohqsg
Well I wanted to avoid that from happening,btohqsg
den don tbe friends with them lah,btohqsg
we cant help u to figure out ur insecurity for u leh HAHA,btohqsg
? ord loh what is squad,btohqsg
I do want to be friends tho,btohqsg
there is no right or wrong answer,btohqsg
It's just I'm afraid of the outcome,btohqsg
The last thing I did was saying hi to them without looking at them and running away after that,btohqsg
this is a binary choice u presented,btohqsg
so there is only a binary answer,btohqsg
U can't control everything. The best you can is try to be sincere about your ihtentions,btohqsg
This is what i do after a long time of not talking and the quarrels?,btohqsg
Man the last thing I did to them saying hi and running away. Then the next day  they saw me and gave a really long eye contact and I kinda got distracted after that so I didn't get to greet them,btohqsg
I think they wanted the reconciliation as well but I just didnt do it properly,btohqsg
Was too scared of the outcome idk why,btohqsg
Then after that everytime they crossed by me  they'll just ignore,btohqsg
Or pretend to ignore we'll never know,btohqsg
I think I gotta little of guts now,btohqsg
The longer you take to reconcile  the harder it will get. Sooner the easier. Yes it'll be scary  it's a risk. If you don't try  it's 0% chance of success. If you try  it won't be 0%. It may not work  but at least you'll know if it works  or if you should just move on.,btohqsg
Thanks man I'll gather up my guts and do it tomorrow,btohqsg
Its better to acknowledge what happened too  but know to move on frm thr will be the better option,btohqsg
If it's something you did that caused the quarrel  also do acknowledge it. Worst thing in reconciliation is always to say how you were right and you willing to forgive others,btohqsg
Wtf is this hot take - it's always this yukeming guy with so many hot takes.You can see his opinion on jobs too.,btohqsg
but i see this im like wtf,btohqsg
Maybe he doesn't need the street cred required for getting a job,btohqsg
This is so true  and I know it can sound empty to a lot of people.But the fact is you have an overwhelming (almost surely by current samples) probability of dying within 300 Earth years  what are you going to do with it?,btohqsg
hot take whereby u have to type a wall of text seething like an incel and put down some internet stranger,btohqsg
