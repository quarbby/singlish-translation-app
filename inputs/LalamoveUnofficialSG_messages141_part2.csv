yeah lo so far my experience is mostly quite flexible one  either sender or receiver pay. if its company as sender typically they will pay la,btohqsg
Facts  happened to me bef too deduction of 50bucks lol damn bastard when I did deliver n llm didn't bother hearing me out,btohqsg
They always protect customer bastard move,btohqsg
I feel some customer super ahole  they complain despite no issue for free delivery but they don't know end up the ones who suffer is us,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt want then tell them to cancel. Because if in the end they don‚Äôt pay you  you complain to Llm also useless. Llm won‚Äôt reimburse you. Only can  advise you make police report,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the same logic as you get scammed by those purchase order. You don‚Äôt collect the money from them before you buy  anything goes wrong Llm also cannot help you.,btohqsg
Ya same... Never kena such thing before also... Care to share what happened bro?,btohqsg
Then this one u really suay lor,btohqsg
I also kana deduction before . I think is timeFor me to change platform liao . Guys Any recommendations?,btohqsg
I see that only MPV no pooling option,btohqsg
Even if they say otherside pay I will call Infront of user first,btohqsg
Best is to avoid cash order,btohqsg
I kena once B4 the client add $30tips. Payment at drop off. At mbs hotel tower 1 total $60 to collect. But they collect at drop off. So too rush to ask to paynow on the spot so jus trust the user will paynow,btohqsg
Need to call and call and WhatsApp so many times s till they paynow,btohqsg
ya dont rush la haha especially cash job,btohqsg
You can see courier order ?,btohqsg
Ya‚Ä¶I thought Wednesday but I received earlier today.,btohqsg
Mine not in yet lehh? You got shares with LLM is it?,btohqsg
Past few week alway tuesday money out,btohqsg
If I got shares  will give some to you‚Ä¶Lol,btohqsg
Recipient called me suddenly ask me where am I. I also like shock. Never introduce herself alsoRude recipient. She said why take so late. I said where got late. It's the sender who just send order,btohqsg
U be the judge based on the timing,btohqsg
Initially it was regular. Then they change to priority. Then I slide to take order,btohqsg
Based on the article... Whatever the product launch at 3pm...but all guests left by 320pm.20min launch/networking? Doesn't sound like a very important launch. No wonder they only ordered vadai for the VIP guests üòÉ,btohqsg
‚ÄúWell  I am the manager‚Äù gets me lol,btohqsg
The delivery timing doesn't even sound right. Who on earth will want to serve guest food at the very last min. I sense the recipient abit of exaggeration somewhere,btohqsg
Funny job. Need help drop off,btohqsg
I feel no wrong at your end.. Cos the distance also not very near n u already delivered on-time according to LLM policy,btohqsg
This is good.. Easy n fast jobüòç hope u took it,btohqsg
May I know if you stacked this order? ü§î,btohqsg
Not at all. My call log below with the sender. The 2.26pm was my usual protocol to call in first to dbl confirm order.,btohqsg
"So I was guessing I took the order like a few secs before I call at 2.26pm. How on the earth I can ""fly"" from Joo Chiat to Buona Vista by 3pm given the time I swipe I took the order. Haven't factor in my journey to Joo Chiat",btohqsg
So definitely not your fault..I hope LLM won't take it out on u even with all the evidence..,btohqsg
Then I've gotta use the power of viral already if that happens. With screenshot and such,btohqsg
This one is vendor problem. People want by 3pm but they wait till 2:35 then book priority.,btohqsg
lol I did this that day couldn‚Äôt find the location very noob of me,btohqsg
Initially was regular. Then they changed to Priority.Based on the news article  recipient seems to have opted for 12-3pm delivery. But then recipient change her mind and requested for specific 2.30pm to 3pm.I was guessing sender agreed to that specific timing but underestimate the timing it will take to travel from Joo Chiat to Buona Vista. Esp via PIE where it's always congested irregardless of time.Must also factor the duration I have to report to the security for me to go up to the building to send the order. This is an office building.,btohqsg
But let's see if LLM will contact me üòÅ,btohqsg
Well by their own standards‚Ä¶.there isn‚Äôt any reason against you here. Timing all met. No damages. Not rude. Cleared. They‚Äôll be thinking real hard.,btohqsg
Anyone took the woodlands to mount senai job?,btohqsg
Keep seeing drivers taking the job but then the job reappeared again and again,btohqsg
Most likely it‚Äôs a scam order man.,btohqsg
Different accounts sameJob‚Ä¶.10 couriers at the door,btohqsg
LLM should set a rule: if a job keeps getting cancelled a number of times  auto delete the job,btohqsg
Guys need to be careful with buy for me orders. There‚Äôs a customer wanted to cheat me. They order and paid from the shop already so I only needed to pick up and send to them. Reached their location they say they don‚Äôt want to put the buy for me charges because I didn‚Äôt buy for them. I told them the app show how much is how much. How can they wait for the driver to delivered then want to edit price. Nearly call police before they ok to pay. Fucked up people just want to jack up the price so drivers will accept then after deliver don‚Äôt wanna pay total price,btohqsg
Yah drivers life is so hard Liao they still pull this type of stunt terrible,btohqsg
My experience was with a flower shop   last minute edit the location and the location was further than the first address and fares was much lower (( I have no idea why this was) then they refused to cancel on their end so suck thumb have to do the job,btohqsg
Exactly. Never think for others. They don‚Äôt pay full but Lalamove will still deduct their commission from the full fee causing the driver need to pay extra commission for nothing,btohqsg
This kind of tricky people a lot. I also get a few orders like this. Add stop after accepting but new fare lower than the original fare,btohqsg
They say the original address someone already took the parcel by mistake. So they change address for me . Don‚Äôt know real or not la but Sibeh bo Hua,btohqsg
