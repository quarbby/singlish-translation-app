You don‚Äôt get 3mpd? You shall get up to 8mpd if you used dedicated uob-Agoda landing website? Visit uob PRVI website for more info.,btohqsg
ah yes 8mpd is for agoda and expedia but im booking on airbnb,btohqsg
From this tnc  no. Airbnb gateway is from UK iirc. You will earn 2.4mpd however.,btohqsg

Hi all  happy CNY! Anyone ‚Äòresetting‚Äô their OCBC 360 in Feb? Withdraw out on 1 Feb is it?,btohqsg
Ask you fellas  if I fast 1.6k to UOB one  then fast to OCBC min 1.8k (1.6k + UOB interest) does that clock for OCBC 360 3.2%?,btohqsg
fast does not work for OCBC. only giro works,btohqsg
Hmm but here says credit via GIRO / fast / paynow via giro / paynow via fast ü§î,btohqsg
you need corporate account for salary credit to register,btohqsg
Ooo so UOB is the only one where the loophole still open,btohqsg
You can check the data points in the forum with many confirmation that it does not work.,btohqsg
Hi may I find out among money market funds/ t bills/ fixed deposits nowadays which can return a higher yield of around 80k SGD? I'm looking at parking the money aside and not using it for at least a year. Thanks!,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think it works for UOB too. Based on my own experience  both OCBC and UOB need a corporate account to bank in the salary before it gives you the interest,btohqsg
Uob is still working for me at leastAnd please dont go and ‚Äúclarify with cso‚Äù,btohqsg
I tried that for 2 months  it didn‚Äôt work and the return without the salary credit component is too low. So closed my account after 6 months,btohqsg
It could be that you were doing something wrong. But anyway  you have already moved on. uob one isnt the only high interest saving acct,btohqsg
I did fast transfer from DBS to UOB one for over a year now and it works fine,btohqsg
Or is it fast transfer from OCBC to UOB doesn‚Äôt work?,btohqsg
I don't recall you can choose salary purpose from ocbc...,btohqsg
Yes. It's a shorter month so you lose out less.,btohqsg
For ocbc 360  really need company HR to credit Ur salary to ocbc account? If we manually transfer from other bank to ocbc  can or not,btohqsg
Short answer  yes to the first qn and no to the 2ndLong answer  yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees & nooooooooooooooooooooo,btohqsg
