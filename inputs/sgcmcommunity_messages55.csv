A Honda was reverse parking into a parallel lot opposite Beauty World Centre when a Jaguar suddenly entered the same lot bonnet first resulting in a 20-minute standoff that saw the police called in.➡️https://bit.ly/3OMpMEgFollow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates,btohqsg
Jialat.🤦‍♂🤦‍♀ auntie lot kena snatched. Just move off and don't block traffic mah....scold that Jaguar guy when car not blocking traffic.🤦‍♂🤦🤦‍♀Later no more parking at Tiong Bahru Market 😅,btohqsg
Hahahahaha looks like it’s that Jaguar guy who is the problem lehhhh. I love how the writer went “luxury car” … Honda already very luxurious for me worrr!,btohqsg
Yes but nothing you can do.Singapore don't have law for parking lot snatching right?Auntie block the entire road.Delivery rider/ driver all stuck.Other customers leaving also stuck,btohqsg
That place the parking already very limited,btohqsg
Food also not very delicious.Unlike nasi Padang,btohqsg

Be nice  order ice black coffee  so he won't be hurt,btohqsg
Interesting question #2: what if the situation were reversed ie the Honda lady was trying to snatch the lot from the Jaguar driver? Wonder how the headline would have been written and general reaction.,btohqsg
Approach nicely  if he got attitude then let karma take over,btohqsg
Or hopefully his car can’t start 🤭,btohqsg
Or key fob drop in longkang,btohqsg
Don't challenge auntie. Cannot win 😵,btohqsg

I did not think of that🤭🤭🤭-R,btohqsg
looks like he already paid and turned around to argue,btohqsg
could park on the side and argue then if he really wants to,btohqsg
He is blocking the entry to the building not the exit,btohqsg
Try to see the good of everyone  amitabah,btohqsg
that’s right! But what he did = blocking both entrance and exit IMO. Vehicles all cannot enter and leave the carpark/building leh-R,btohqsg

the battery pack had better be adequately protected in collison,btohqsg
tesla is okay la on balance,btohqsg
it is like smartphone when you use inferior battery it can explode,btohqsg
The most easy car to be on fire is hybrid,btohqsg

@skylar313what’s the app and code you used for tow,btohqsg
But thank you for reminding me HAHA,btohqsg
Special compound just for the car.,btohqsg
"Let me share one jam incident yesterday because of a series of misunderstandings.I drove into a single lane and had to stop there cos no parking and I'm getting a takeaway (very common btw at that place among the vendors and drivers)A Merc saw me coming in and quickly went to his car to drive off (despite his order not ready yet) so as not to block my way  but I'm also going to have a takeaway too. I tried to stop him from going through the trouble and sounded my horn to catch his attention but he was too fast lol that's kind of him btw.So I placed my order and waited  just then a man came and ""accidentally"" cut my queue cos he saw the auntie putting a bag of order in front of me and thought my order was done (it actually belonged to that kind Merc driver)End up I had to wait extra longer  when the auntie could have made mine and I would have left (it's a quick order btw) and by now the single lane had built up a bit of traffic. The kind Merc driver also had taken his order and ended up stuck for a while because I ended up at the front of the queue.The above happenings are what ppl not involved usually doesn't see  only the resulting situation.",btohqsg
thank you for sharing and definitely very good of the Merc gentleman!,btohqsg
that last sentence is so true and a good timely reminder.,btohqsg
Shell to offer exclusive F&B deals islandwide in the month of AugustShell celebrates its centennial celebrations with awesome deals with eight food and beverage partners available at selected Shell stations.👉🏻 React with 😁 if you are excited to enjoy these awesome F&B deals!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
I will advocate authorities to make the single lane a drive thru like mcd. 😂 just because a norm for takeaways doesn’t equate to norms for what a driveway is designed for.,btohqsg
This is precisely what happened to right turn on no green arrows until authorities have to step in to make it a right turn only when green arrows shows,btohqsg
Too many car no patient   car too slow to move off,btohqsg
Exactly. So drivers must be patience,btohqsg
Not sure because some tendency of daydreaming. Even when lights are in favour without opposing cars going straight can take more than 3-seconds to move until only 3 cars can cleared the turning lanes since we cannot move beyond the dotted lines.,btohqsg
So many junctions with turning lanes are always packed…,btohqsg
seen so many drivers no patient  see a short distance gap from incoming car and want to move off,btohqsg
then when move off car is so slow like my grandma,btohqsg
that why incoming car will hit on them,btohqsg
Worse are those with three turning lanes.. some cannot even keep in their lane paths.,btohqsg
to me if you are impatient and dont want to wait  when right turn  change to a faster car  or be harder on the accelerater,btohqsg
dont be like a grand ma crawling when u dont have the right of way,btohqsg
If authorities wanna recuperate the tax  should just make everyone renew their driving licenses like in the past.,btohqsg
and at least see the incoming car  if it is a fast car please just wait,btohqsg
saw alot of slow car like vezel  and such insist in turning right  when incoming car be a fast car like a 535,btohqsg
The problem is many cannot judged. So all lan lan followed the slowness,btohqsg
Of being withold by the red arrows 😅,btohqsg
many drivers will said acceleration is useless  but they have no patient,btohqsg
car slow  but dont want to wait,btohqsg
The inpatient ones are those cannot step hard on their brakes too,btohqsg
I admit sometimes when entering carpark I was so engrossed in a thought that I almost followed thru and skipped the carpark gantry lol,btohqsg
The cars literally inching at the junctions,btohqsg
Until I saw the bar then realised,btohqsg
Like one video I saw on reckless drivers  everyone blaming the jazz for crossing double white lines and list the offences etc but no one pointed out that the car in front and the cam car didn't had the courtesy to give way,btohqsg
Exactly! Many drove into middle lane and even horn me when I kept to my lane lol,btohqsg
Study theory lol or clock a few hours on road theory will do,btohqsg
Dotted lanes are there as guidelines also can cross over. I just 🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
Just redo practical better. Esp focus on traffic light junctions and parallel parking. 🫢,btohqsg
SPC: Celebrate National Day at SPC with 23% off all fuels plus credit/debit card rebates from 2 to 15 August 2022 (12 noon)! T&Cs apply.,btohqsg
Tester just sit in the owner’s car and do checklist. So no excuse for drivers quoting not getting used to standard driving test cars like we used in getting the P license,btohqsg
Lifelong learning must be advocated in full by authority. Use skillfutures to offset also can. 🥶,btohqsg
I feel that if someone is taking slightly more time to move out from the turning box on a right turn without green arrow  it is still ok as you don't know what's visible from their angle and they might feel it is better to wait for a few extra seconds because of a previous experience possibly,btohqsg
Encouraging only those who don’t drive for a long time doesn’t really address the competency for the entire driving community,btohqsg
That’s also the cause of why some get impatient before the turn on green arrows too,btohqsg
And the impatient ones also beat lights,btohqsg
So make everyone go back to basic 101 on a regular basis.,btohqsg
Yeah  goes both ways. But in the end  patience is important when on the roads. Don't anyhow honk at people who are trying to turn as well but might be waiting first to get a clearer view of the oncoming traffic,btohqsg
If car is being advocated for regular inspection check up  i am sure humans need that more,btohqsg
Indeed. Driving is not meant to be fast and furious but to take a slow moments to enjoy what others who cannot own and drive 😅,btohqsg
That’s what the old unkers and aunties are doing on expressways lane 1 😂,btohqsg
The unspoken rule for driving fast on expressways these days are those of the trunk lanes,btohqsg
They drive faster than those on lane 1,btohqsg
A friend of mine recently got tailgated by the smaller lorry as well,btohqsg
Scary how they're getting so impatient and driving like that,btohqsg
Don’t play play… they are rushing for delivery? I will give way as they indicated their intents,btohqsg
I'm all for increasing the speed limit for the smaller lorries but they must do it in the right way because they certainly don't have the brakes to stop if anything goes wrong,btohqsg
Just give way. No point challenging a vehicle trying to go fast,btohqsg
Esp if one has no intent to move faster.,btohqsg
That’s not the case for those on lane 1 😅,btohqsg
You have to cut them on their left to pass them and watch your rear view mirror to observe and os about their slowness as you move along,btohqsg
Just let the cctv catch them and fine them accordingly,btohqsg
Way too many road hoggers in lane 1 nowadays,btohqsg
I have never seen anyone get a fine for road hogging  because it isn't an objective rule to apply like a speed limit,btohqsg
Most forgotten they have to give way if they are slower than 80kmh on lane 1,btohqsg
I notice old uncle and auntie lose to toxic ppl with family man sticker like kids on board,btohqsg
Like the case of section 377,btohqsg
High beam ppl when over take,btohqsg
I think the unsaid rule is just give way if someone flashes their high beams at you or turns on their right signal in lane 1,btohqsg
Give way if you see someone ocming up behind you who is faster than you  then merge back behind them when you have the chance,btohqsg
I like that idea of the signals that is well accepted in msia nsh,btohqsg
I notice those road hogger scare of super hogger like me,btohqsg
If they drive 70 and hog the road,btohqsg
I will go infront of them and drive 73,btohqsg
U see them get impatient then try to over take you,btohqsg
The high beams work more than signals in Singapore but a lot of the times  the hogger really turn a blind eye,btohqsg
The best way to deal with them is over take them and drive slower,btohqsg
I also turn a blind eye on those who don’t even bother to turn on headlights at night,btohqsg
Let them have a taste of own medicine,btohqsg
I believe in calmer driving in most cases,btohqsg
They got the excuse to drive slow 😅,btohqsg
ya but some time see your rear mirror and see thier frustrated face is funny,btohqsg
Yeah. Where got time to slowly move. Waste my petrol efficiency,btohqsg
they will compalint to thier wife  why i drive so slow,btohqsg
The wife will lame why you drive so slow to let other over take,btohqsg
Speed up then slow down a bit for Regen power,btohqsg
can waste thier petrol if they get agreesive by trying to over take,btohqsg
And there are those who brake too early…,btohqsg
then see thier frusstrated face again then stay in middle lane,btohqsg
Wear my brake pads unnecessarily when slowing down is all it takes,btohqsg
but road hoggers give u fair share of frustration  and entermaintment on the road,btohqsg
Those forgotten that only brake when coming to the arrows at the junctions not too early,btohqsg
Entertainment when it is not applied on you eh.,btohqsg
entertainment is subjective and depent on oppurtunity,btohqsg
some time u see ogt oppurtunity to over take,btohqsg
really hard to resist drive slower then them,btohqsg
this is where the entertainment come from,btohqsg
ya but i agree also i some time see ppl get really agreesive in tail gate high beam and such on hogger,btohqsg
i just stay middle lane and wacth,btohqsg
I will chase those who act aggressively,btohqsg
but hard to resist if there is oppurtunity to go in front of them and go slower,btohqsg
Just don’t do on lane 1,btohqsg
maybe i should buy a sticker road hogger and paste behind,btohqsg
Then there will be those will paste don’t tailgate sign,btohqsg
all these actions on the road is childish  but is part and parcel,btohqsg
Your road hogger sign should be at the front windscreen,btohqsg
actually i dont hog the road,btohqsg
Hope the front can see and give way,btohqsg
i only hog   those that road hog,btohqsg
That’s if they even bother to look at their rear mirrors,btohqsg
some of them they deliberately 1,btohqsg
u can see they purposly slow down to maintain the same speed as the middle lane so u cant over take,btohqsg
Ya lah. So we can pray got ambulance to catch them,btohqsg
that why i odnt tail gate  and i leave like 3-4 cars length,btohqsg
so to caught them off guard,btohqsg
Normally when i am in middle lanes  i will slow down to create gaps for those on lane 1 to filter in,btohqsg
but some lane 1 also slow down alot,btohqsg
Then dunno why some behind will just overtake and jam in from of me,btohqsg
disturb middle lane ppl is just weird lol,btohqsg
uusally all the action is in lane 1,btohqsg
They don’t know got fast emergency vehicles approaching meh?,btohqsg
The culture here is just as bad as in china soon,btohqsg
alot of them is really base on car power and modifcation 1,btohqsg
They can afford to bang 😅,btohqsg
car slow there is like 3rd class citizen,btohqsg
Fast is not a right phenomenon,btohqsg
u dont buy a good car to drive during peak period,btohqsg
alot of scracthes from motor and such,btohqsg
Here in sg is different. Need more than one car will do,btohqsg
One car banged still have another to use,btohqsg

America mindset very different from Asians. They are everything about “me”  “my” and “I”! Sibei self centric. It’s not about community and society at large. That’s why they screwed up big time and start blaming other countries for overtaking them. What a lame country!,btohqsg
You are damn right. Just like the expats ideology they have,btohqsg
Be an expat and screw up locals,btohqsg
Gone were the days where ONLY white skin are expats and all living the high life. I’ve seen many Ang Moh leading a down to earth life in Singapore as waiters as bartenders. Not everyone are Directors or CEO.,btohqsg
Just glad the expats here are generally well behaved,btohqsg
Except some black sheep who thinks they are still in their colonial days and some Banking or IT expat who think Singaporean owes them big favours in contributing to our economy.,btohqsg
pls cheap to become director in spore,btohqsg
even the conman is a director  they still drive mcclaren,btohqsg
But to be fair   they are good at creating great company,btohqsg

It is a good car in that segment,btohqsg
More features compared to the Toyota raize for sure,btohqsg
Can consider having a look at the Hyundai venue too,btohqsg
Not so popular because many go for the vezel at that price point which offers slightly more space,btohqsg
In terms of power  sonet is only 2nd to the arona,btohqsg
But sonet uses a CVT while arona uses the VW group dsg,btohqsg
Same powertrain as in the 1.5 golf,btohqsg
Many people have doubts about the sonet as it is manufactured at Kia's indian facility compared to the venue that comes from Korea or the Arona that is made in Spain. But  in terms of quality standards  the Sonet still maintains the same level as that of the venue since they are essentially the same cars built on the same platform,btohqsg
kinda worried that if deciding on sonet  how hard would it be to find a good maintenance and servicing for it,btohqsg
Definitely no argument about their innovation aspects. That’s why they are still number ONE in their economic prowess! However  I have grave concern as many of their innovation seems stagnant! Apple has not innovate much compared to Samsung  Huawei or Xiao Mi. NASA has also stop sending people up in space. Worrying sia,btohqsg
how about the 2021 hyundai avante,btohqsg
The west seemed to lead most of the innovation in the past  but just talk about cars these days  it’s Japanese cars that dominate the World and Korean is catching up.,btohqsg
Maintenance not hard  after all it is a regular kia/Hyundai,btohqsg
Most cars in their lineup share parts quite a bit,btohqsg
And it isn't a super old car that would make it harder to find parts,btohqsg
If you were looking at something like a Chevrolet then definitely much harder because there's very few of the brand in general,btohqsg
However there are a lot of Kias on the road and they tend to have a lot of shared parts,btohqsg
Great car from what I've heard and based on the demo unit at some roadshows. The looks are a bit polarising for me but that is subjective,btohqsg
Depends on the space you want and form factor your prefer,btohqsg
Sonet  venue  arona might be slightly easier to manoeuvre as they are shorter in terms of length,btohqsg
And you get a slightly more accessible seating position where you can step in instead of a sedan that you have to drop into,btohqsg
If you do look at the avante  it is worth considering the cerato which offers a slightly more old school and traditional design language with similar features,btohqsg
And also the Mazda 3 which offers slightly better materials used in the cabin and offers a few extra features if you would like,btohqsg
avante have the fierce and sporty look also haha,btohqsg
buy cerato dun buy red... ppl might stare at your car😂,btohqsg
The rear light bar is very modern and reminiscent of the new Porsche design language on the 959 Cayenne  992 911 and 2nd gen macan,btohqsg
For me it is the front that lets the car down  but again  looks are subjective,btohqsg
The Mazda 3 also offers mild hybrid tech with the clever i-stop if you are one who is concerned about fuel consumption,btohqsg
Actually  between the 3. Mazda 3 has the longest wheelbase,btohqsg
But avante is a longer body which gives you the assumption that it has more legroom,btohqsg
But they aren't that far off from each other,btohqsg
Can go down to the Leng Kee showrooms and compare,btohqsg
The difference is about 1 to 2 inches with the avante having slightly more,btohqsg
This again depends on driver and front passenger seat settings too,btohqsg
Don’t forget blockchain crypto   metaverse   metaverse is the next big thing,btohqsg

chop the car park then say my son one,btohqsg
"@SGCM_Adminthe vehicle is not a jaguar XF but a jaguar XE. Also the Honda is an Odyssey  it isn't nice to see all the media outlets always using conti brands and the term. ""luxury vehicle"" in these cases because it has created a bad image of drivers/owners of these cars. People on the roads really hold grudges and prejudices against them. Hope we can make a change and build a better image with inclusivity for all",btohqsg
Yuppp and it is actually very reliable  especially with this generation and cars post 2015,btohqsg
"Oh and both the cars were similarly priced when new. Just something else to consider when people do make comparisons  ""luxury vs regular""",btohqsg
when u cannot afford a jaguar...u said those people is outside your circle,btohqsg
they are all bad people  we are human afterall,btohqsg

my rickshaw is CONTI-nuous running. Does that count?,btohqsg

What’s a good mileage to look at buying a 2019 reg car,btohqsg
unless they got servicing records from Ad,btohqsg
Nowadays learner cars using Nissan note e-power and Kona EV,btohqsg
Indeed  all the seating positions in used cars are tempered with.,btohqsg
But set a higher limit of 50 to 60k maybe,btohqsg
And it is easy to figure out if the mileage has been tampered with and it also depends on the car model,btohqsg
Some are very hard to tamper,btohqsg
And doing a PPI is important for that purpose because if anything has been done,btohqsg
It will always show up in the logs,btohqsg
Hmmm I guess will need to try out,btohqsg
More comfortable to drive.Compare to DCT. Alot of gear changing. Jerky,btohqsg
Dct good for performance oriented cars,btohqsg
Which is Porsche's version of a dct,btohqsg
That also depends on how they were used,btohqsg
A lot of golfs tuned horribly,btohqsg
What’s a good first car to suggest  for far distance travel  back and forth  and also wanna use the car to earn some money to do hitch or parcel delivery,btohqsg
For the daily drive CVT is pretty smooth and decent,btohqsg
I have Kia sonet  avante  and venue to consider now  any others?,btohqsg
But you will find features missing,btohqsg
And might feel that the interiors are dated if that is something you care for,btohqsg
Are you looking at new or used?,btohqsg
And what is your budget/key requirements,btohqsg
Hmmm I would say less than 120k? Value of car lesser than 120k  just wanna have a feel of being a car owner also  to see whether can I manage it before jumping into slightly higher end cars or even continental cars. But for sure that will be on a long run,btohqsg
I will be using it a lot for traveling  firstly is to send my fiancé to work  then I go work  north to east  then maybe fee time can do some hitch to earn some extra income to cover the cost of a car,btohqsg
Any rough depre that you are looking at?,btohqsg
Because 120k for 1 year left and 9 years left can be different,btohqsg
Wouldn’t wanna spend too much on a monthly basis  at least 1.5k including petrol and parking?,btohqsg
Petrol will be variable based on your running which seems to be on the higher side,btohqsg
Around 12k range per year bah  since now coe is expensive,btohqsg
Best is 5 years or more left,btohqsg
I would say right now is the worst time to jump in as the market is not a buyers' market at all,btohqsg
Your best options are probably 2017 to 2019 Corolla Altis  Kia Cerato  Mazda 3 and Hyundai Elantra/avante,btohqsg
As they offer lower maintenance cost  tend to be reliable with longer major service intervals  decent fuel efficiency and there's enough on the market to consider so you can find the right unit at the right price,btohqsg
But definitely look into maintanence and petrol for your budget,btohqsg
And work out a more exact figure to see if you are comfortable with it or not,btohqsg
Best not to push yourself and get something to jump into the world of car ownership then regret it due to mounting bills,btohqsg
Probably avoid cars like the wish  vezel  Prius because many do have issues with maintanence and mileage tampering because of use as PHV,btohqsg
Also since you are getting a used car,btohqsg
Budget maybe 5% of the car's price for wear and tear,btohqsg
That you might have to do up in the near future,btohqsg

Don’t mind me if I ask a lot beginner questions HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Used car might be better for you for sure since you are jumping in for the first time so if you do decide you don't want to stay on anymore. Can sell in a while and not take a huge depreciation hit like that on new cars,btohqsg
Not the main purpose lah  wanna earn money going to place that I wanna go  at the same time fetch anyone to earn the money!,btohqsg
However it is also luck based because if you end up with a bad unit  you might have a bad first experience,btohqsg
first car best is to get a used old conti  u get to learn parts of car u NVR heard of in your life real fast.,btohqsg
I probably going for a used conti for a next car  most probably like a Audi,btohqsg
good choice... if you dun want to learn anything about car then get a Tesla...😛,btohqsg
also don't be too alarmed with what people say about contis and reliability,btohqsg
if you find a good unit and have done a thorough inspection to check for basic known issues  you are going to have a smooth time,btohqsg
and many do confuse higher maintenance cost to be a sign of bad reliability which is not the case,btohqsg
All cars have their own set of problems  just that some cost more to fix due to labour costs or parts that are slightly more expensive!,btohqsg

stick to original paper filter. best filtration,btohqsg
Later got one bmw pop pop,btohqsg
One is J and one is R,btohqsg
I think he don’t qualify. Both car and driver too young 🤣🤣,btohqsg
not true  some of them do improve air flow especially for turbocharged cars. but of course it doesn't do much by itself  you do need to upgrade more parts and do a tune up for more result.,btohqsg
