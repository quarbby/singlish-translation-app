then now you also cannot with bio,btohqsg
then you read yourself you also cannot understand,btohqsg
so now ur main problem is that you need someone to explain to you that makes you understand,btohqsg
ho chi minh was the leader of north vietnam who invaded the south to try to liberate it from the us rule. After the invasion of south vietnam  saigon was renamed to ho chi minh today to commemorate the successful invasion under hcm,btohqsg
but i still called it saigon,btohqsg
Oh wah i did not know the history,btohqsg
But i feel the pain  that thing was actually w heavy,btohqsg
I cant imagine under hot weather but the time i went was during vietnam’s cooler weather,btohqsg
oh u went north vietnam isit,btohqsg
dont go during june i tell u it is the hottest time to visit,btohqsg
Yea  when i went was around late teens early 20s,btohqsg
Idk why I decided to do it this year but somehow I'm preemptively writing,btohqsg
YTForwarded messageFrom YTI do not wish to engage in this conversation,btohqsg
"meeting up in adult life be like : ""eh bro can i reserve u for dinner for next year christmas?"" ""cannot la i got exams the week after chrismas""",btohqsg
Diff is they club a lot,btohqsg
a few hrs of class T_T,btohqsg
Bruh why is my hall below yours,btohqsg
Also lmao Hall 5 is B tier df,btohqsg
Eh we got a gym ok,btohqsg
It's shit but still a gym,btohqsg
As I said it is a gym not good but still it exists,btohqsg
Also for the record the Weights are locked lmao u need to get the key from.. eh I forget liao should be Hall President,btohqsg
guess what subj I'm doing now,btohqsg
Atp I'm gonna get A for bio and tetra U for alvl,btohqsg
please dun give up / sacrifice on ur other 3 subjects even with that strong love for bio...tbh i was a bit lucky focusing on chem + phy  my econs and math still managed to come out w an A,btohqsg
The time I spend on bio is disproportionate to the time I spend on others,btohqsg
Personally that one S or U is gonna kill you and pull your RP to shit,btohqsg
same for me towards chem and phy,btohqsg
This was my study time for march,btohqsg
speaking of which...my study plan for march holidays in j2 is somehow still pasted on my wall,btohqsg
but u dun want to get 1 A and the rest just passing  i think it is better to try ur best in the other subjects as well (and i also dw to see ur bio getting diminishing returns etc),btohqsg
nah i do study other stuff,btohqsg
like i did chem in the afternoon,btohqsg
i usually do hist chem and math in the afternoon,btohqsg
wah i dun actually plan my time out in details,btohqsg
no this one is study timer,btohqsg
i just do what i feel like doing,btohqsg
then you cannot use apps on your phone during the study time,btohqsg
oh wah that is actually kinda cool  i didnt know it exist lmao,btohqsg
tbh i realized when i start planning my study  i always over plan and pack too many things,btohqsg
imo i feel very unproductive everyday,btohqsg
but eh wtv time to get back to work,btohqsg
Bro I can break the TM curse,btohqsg
Valerie jiejie is gonna get 90rp,btohqsg
Unlike someone who got PENTA U,btohqsg
Just by paying (somewhat) attn in class,btohqsg
Alot of the ppl in my class take h1 geog,btohqsg
Alot of H1 geog ppl don't give a fuck,btohqsg
My friend got B for prelims D for a levels geog 💀,btohqsg
Ok la that's prolly a fucking TM problem,btohqsg
In Acjc for 2021 a levels the top person for h2 geog prelims got C for a level,btohqsg
Idk man  he normally quite good for geog internals eh,btohqsg
Cap i saw yall holding hands,btohqsg
Of course! I respect anyone from tmjc,btohqsg
Ik someone dropped from A to E?,btohqsg
SOMEHOW GET A EVEN THO IM IN HER TUTORIAL CLASS,btohqsg
Thought that was the only year it happened,btohqsg
he told me his cousin who was top in AC geog dropped from A to E,btohqsg
I think the year right before,btohqsg
also respect the ending at 4+ everyday,btohqsg
fml this is the most dog shit UI i have ever seen,btohqsg
how was ur gp timed trial,btohqsg
Im procrastinating my essay writing for my friend,btohqsg
i wrote the one about music has no purpose other than entertainment,btohqsg
I think JJC 2016 Qn 6,btohqsg
Hmm is the cousin a he or she,btohqsg
I rmbr the A to C person is a she,btohqsg
Could very well be the same person,btohqsg
Ik its not 2021 because his cousin is older than him,btohqsg
I thought my class rojak alrd,btohqsg
only 3 combis cuz ej doesnt offer jackshit,btohqsg
My class got 6? Combis iirc,btohqsg
but ngl all the BCMg ppl are ok but some of the BCMe people are 🤮🤮 yet my closest friends in the class are BCMethen again most of the class takes BCMe so not surprising,btohqsg
The girl who top H1 geog for my batch,btohqsg
In my class everyone took geog and econsGELmGEMhGEM h1 cseGEMpGEMcGEMb,btohqsg
In fact Acjc used to offer ONLY h1 cse without h2 cse,btohqsg
theres no h1 csc i think,btohqsg
They started h2 cse for class of 2024,btohqsg
Hey she's having fun I suppose,btohqsg
i thought h2 csc used to have the research paper but they scrapped it alr,btohqsg
I only heard they change syllabus but still there,btohqsg
Val u need more P&C practice?,btohqsg
Oh maybe since I can’t find the subject code in the new a level timetable,btohqsg
also maybe that’s why Acjc started to offer h2 cse,btohqsg
cuz i heard their chinese department is like quite jialat,btohqsg
PLS don't cancel me but ..,btohqsg
Seems to be  it’s not inside the a level timetable this year,btohqsg
It’s jialat but it has nothing to do with h2 cse what,btohqsg
:( sad but then again back when I did it I was the only candidate lmao,btohqsg
In fact one of the cse teachers is a Malay guy,btohqsg
oh i thought csc change to cse,btohqsg
Wait what  maybe Acjc didn’t offer h1 cse then,btohqsg
But csc not offered at acjc,btohqsg
It was like on the way to get phased out,btohqsg
Cse is taught in English what,btohqsg
i think a sch offers either but not both,btohqsg
like dhs only offers csc but not cse for obvious reasons,btohqsg
I guess so  idk of any schs that offers both,btohqsg
Class of 2023 still had h1 cse in Acjc,btohqsg
Wait orpheus you took history econ cse and math ?,btohqsg
Math was 2022 but yeah MOB as well,btohqsg
2021 H1 CSE was alr ded by then,btohqsg
Imo more jc should offer h2 poa and mob,btohqsg
That’s weird. There should’ve been acjc students I thought,btohqsg
Not a single JC offers commerce stream,btohqsg
Back then it was a ded subject liao lmao it ain't worth for the content,btohqsg
Hukou system and stuff like those,btohqsg
As I mentioned before it was scrapped entirely for JCs  and I think it should be brought back to at least 2,btohqsg
Wait minh you take pcme or smth,btohqsg
MI is a centralised institute not a jc,btohqsg
Which means MI is the only govt sch to offer mob and poa at the a levels,btohqsg
H2 triple science with h1 geog,btohqsg
this one cannot deny but ill take it as a jc as it teaches a level syllabus,btohqsg
MOB is designed for 3 years lmao,btohqsg
Commerce stream subjects are designed for 3 years,btohqsg
I mean JCs can devise their own curriculum I guess?,btohqsg
Idk I suck at POA F9 one,btohqsg
Means need to push analysis to Y2 which is a stretch,btohqsg
Since it’s still called principles of accounting idk where the 2nd A comes from,btohqsg
Principle of accounts (O levels)Hence  POAprinciple of accounts (A levels)Hence  PAA,btohqsg
Or maybe Acjc only started offering h1 cse for class of 2022 so 2021 not yet. Anyway how you found out that you were the only student for h1 cse that year?,btohqsg
ROI and other measures of market sucess matrix,btohqsg
wtf. Shouldn’t it be PAO and PAA then,btohqsg
Cuz PU3 is designed to build on PU1 stuff the motivation crap,btohqsg
that is what the chers say one,btohqsg
and my friends taking poa can confirm,btohqsg
Oh ok what about the only student part,btohqsg
I was for CSE the only student was CSE,btohqsg
But MOB got quite a lot ppl when I did it lmao,btohqsg
Cuz its the subject of choice for the private colleges as well,btohqsg
Ya I meant this  how did you find out that was the case,btohqsg
Because the private candidate schedules of all index numbers are pasted on the board for the day,btohqsg
But then it won’t show those from JCs right,btohqsg
No but if no Private candidates took it u can bet your ass they are otw to phase it out,btohqsg
Cuz at least a few will retain or take PC,btohqsg
Oh then I guess you can say that you were the only private candidate but can’t say that there were none from JCs,btohqsg
There should’ve been a few from JCs,btohqsg
From JC there probably was a few but they had a # for my subject,btohqsg
Which was the last year or the last 2 years this subject will be offered ever,btohqsg
Then 2023 should’ve been the last year,btohqsg
Yeah either 2023 or 2022 should have been the last year,btohqsg
Also since you were the only student taking that subject did you get the whole room for yourself,btohqsg
There was a student in my class that took h1 cse so 2023,btohqsg
No not nice the invigilator will legit just stare at you for the entire paper,btohqsg
Oh ok I thought every room they would need at least 2,btohqsg
Where did you go to take your papers though,btohqsg
Up till now idk where private candidates go to take theirs,btohqsg
No it's 1 just that they rotate,btohqsg
2020 and 2021 was MOE language centres,btohqsg
Did YT say sth like he went to vjc last year,btohqsg
If so 2023 should’ve been that sch,btohqsg
S is like 2.5RP for H1 or even worse 5RP for H2,btohqsg
I think we should be like British Alevels... where is our sociology and psychology,btohqsg
Basically AAS/A will get you like 75 RP,btohqsg
Bro it's even worse for As cuz if it's a H2 u might be at risk for not even qualifying for Uni,btohqsg
SMU will just straight reject u,btohqsg
my friend say because of covid,btohqsg
Yeah CLT was the most useless shit ever,btohqsg
In fact often it was the easiest one and most straightforward to do,btohqsg
And CLT just forces you to pick the others,btohqsg
Did SEAB relax the moderation guidelines for covid? I don't recall em doing so walao the UK boards did that sia so good,btohqsg
SEAB doesn't even share how they do it. Our understanding comes from the UK boards which is most likely grade boundaries,btohqsg
For O lev private candidate like English   where do you go to take it ?,btohqsg
2023 decreased to only one? my friend say 2020 has 30 taking poa,btohqsg
MOB got a fuck ton of ppl,btohqsg
U aren't competing with just MI ppl for MOB..,btohqsg
my friend went from JC for 3 months (January) then to TP for 9 months (April) then to mdis a level for 10 months (January following year),btohqsg
Yeah.. MDIS is known for quite a lot of ppl doing MOB,btohqsg
I think people here are interested in USA more than China,btohqsg
Who is the most common perceived enemy of the US?,btohqsg
I dun care about what curse or not  I just do me,btohqsg
and my friend the teacher teaching POA at MDIS says that all inmates in prison taking A Level takes POA and MOB? Is it true?,btohqsg
Geog is not the only one…h1 sci also (not sure about chem but phy and bio is 💀),btohqsg
at your own secondary school if it is near your home,btohqsg
That one idk bro we don't do the papers tgt with prisoners,btohqsg
It has been on my wall since mar 2019  been 5y,btohqsg
Who did US perceived most commonly as their enemy?,btohqsg
Basically i kinda hv time management problems and also + i am kind who writes 4 lines for 1m lmao,btohqsg
Im pretty sure that gp day became non existent💀,btohqsg
Straight A then U for GP,btohqsg
U mean to get that B to A,btohqsg
I wonder if uni will conditionally accept and allow the std to retake it,btohqsg
Oh u mean the actual A levels,btohqsg
Idk what is w econs but it is full of these lol,btohqsg
After 4y of uni  i just realized that the igp is based off gp C and pw C and if u get higher than C in those 2  u can use it the offset the igp (written in content subj grades),btohqsg
Also it's assume Both are C not based off so for those AAA/A it probably still would be likely for it to be both PW and GP A as well,btohqsg
No it assumes C for the whole igp  and if u score higher than that  apparently can offset,btohqsg
i didn't write it but i relate to it a lot,btohqsg
friends are temporary 7 distinctions for alvl is forever,btohqsg
he/she definitely 'over prioritised' grades over having friends,btohqsg
that's probably what OP is on abt,btohqsg
i only talk to 1 person from pri sch now,btohqsg
i kinda am like that person now,btohqsg
i met him last week cause he came dhs to play match,btohqsg
but other than him i dont even talk to other pri sch ppl,btohqsg
and guess what we werent even that close in pri sch,btohqsg
some people rather have friends and possibly not have good grades than to be fking lonely with good grades,btohqsg
why does it sound like im the only person supporting op,btohqsg
Iran has launched a swarm of explosive drones and fired missiles at Israel in its first-ever direct attack on Israeli territory.https://str.sg/7NkPHere's what an open war between Israel and Iran could look like:https://str.sg/sAKN,btohqsg
guess im lucky to have good grades still and,btohqsg
i was very loner in pri schi tried to make friends in sec1 and 2 but stuff happenedthen now i just dont bother,btohqsg
im still kinda close to my sec sch friends at least,btohqsg
sometimes being alone isnt a bad thing,btohqsg
like i see those us high school couples,btohqsg
who ask should i go to my gf's college over my dream college,btohqsg
if your rs is meant to last,btohqsg
its gonna last even if you guys go to different countries to studyif its not meant to be it wont last even if yall in the same clas,btohqsg
did my typing just get slower,btohqsg
yea like tbh i dont really talk to my close friends that much but when some shit happened in y3 they were the ones to step up and help me,btohqsg
and like they dont really initiate alot of stuff but last year they still planned some stuff for my bday,btohqsg
id rather them than like a big group of ppl who gna ditch you as soon as your are no longer useful,btohqsg
meanwhile for me they forgot abt my bday until i told them LOL,btohqsg
my close friend went to london after promos last year and got me a keychain (she bought a whole bag and ask us to choose)It wasnt much but im happy she remembered me,btohqsg
at least she gave smth to remember her or smth,btohqsg
at least he took a grp photo of us,btohqsg
before he went back to china,btohqsg
"idk why but i rmb this patrizia gucci quote ""its better to cry in a rolls royce than to be happy on a bicycle""",btohqsg
tbh i also dk why i become so jaded and agree with her,btohqsg
when me a few years back wouldnt,btohqsg
i feel like yea money cant buy happiness but it could definitely  solve alot of my problems and make me less stressed,btohqsg
Meanwhile the short chinese guys in one corner with nobody,btohqsg
Inference tells me this user is a Indian girl,btohqsg
Prob because luxury is here to stay  feelings of temporary happiness is temporary,btohqsg
I rmb in 2021 the proportion of Indian students q big,btohqsg
Or maybe it's just many of my Indian friends from sec sch go there,btohqsg
Their football team in 2022 also indian majority,btohqsg
Half my class indian not that i mind or anything,btohqsg
i have seen one yellow one near my house,btohqsg
new kind of taxis in singapore nobody is going to know is  a taxi,btohqsg
MALAYSIA MENTIONED 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 WTF IS ROTI PRATA 😱😱😱😱😱,btohqsg
Hi can i ask yall opinion on smth.Isit ok to ask your teacher for help with questions on weekends,btohqsg
after getting yelled at by my teacher 10000 times  i can confirm that it is ok to ask your teacher for help over the weekends,btohqsg
What if they never daid anythig about it,btohqsg
But i literally kena bluetick for 2 days in a row,btohqsg
when did you send the msg,btohqsg
I try nit to but my wa1 for the subject is tmr on a monday,btohqsg
Yesterday was like 7pm but like i get it HAHA,btohqsg
ask is one thing  they leave you on read is another,btohqsg
"then come monday ""eh why you never handup""..but i sent it to you alr",btohqsg
@Saylortwiftttry asking in the alvl study chat,btohqsg
there got alot of chem gods,btohqsg
My qn like simple one i damn paiseh,btohqsg
theres no shame in asking for help,btohqsg
the only stupid questions are the ones unasked,btohqsg
lol if this extends to june,btohqsg
my flight gna be extended an hour,btohqsg
yes it is ok.It is also ok for your teacher to ignore all messages not sent between 7am to 6pm on weekdays and all messages on weekends.,btohqsg
Can i ask how do i unpin this group,btohqsg
First a ghost unmute this chat for me  now a ghost pinned it,btohqsg
It depends on ur relationship w the tutor also,btohqsg
White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the threat from Iran was real and viable.,btohqsg
I think my rs with him is ok ig,btohqsg
How often should you eat instant noodles,btohqsg
as a civilian try not toas an nsf every night after lp,btohqsg
u asked the qn u received the answer and u refuse it?,btohqsg
If it’s from tuition teachers should be fine but better not for sch teachers,btohqsg
if like genuine qn most chers wont mind i think,btohqsg
they might not respond immediately tho,btohqsg
had a cher who was like 24hr cld answer  goated,btohqsg
idk how u still can support palestine at this point,btohqsg
Like 2 3 times a week,btohqsg
I think you better eat after lights out,btohqsg
op is the one having trouble managing between both,btohqsg
it's reddit where everything is black and white and nuance is discouraged,btohqsg
tbh most people will do better with their friends around...,btohqsg
so like i dont understand the comments LOL,btohqsg
op post makes them sound very idealistic,btohqsg
and op is overestimating the importance of friends,btohqsg
friends are good to have but you wont die without,btohqsg
eh you say this kind of stuff on sgexams you cant expect no backlash at all,btohqsg
grades are but a number but friends are also just a person,btohqsg
and at the same time both can be your life,btohqsg
yea but not all friends will stick with you for life lol,btohqsg
So the comment is kinda misleading,btohqsg
then its good that you made friends that stick by you la  because got some people is their so called friends all zao when they grad,btohqsg
i remember the dude who took a fat shit in the school sink,btohqsg
kukubird kukubird this is my kukubird,btohqsg
eh i havent grad from dhs yet but then for my pri sch i rmb both grades and shitty memories,btohqsg
or maybe i just cursed to remember everything,btohqsg
in sec school i remember me being outcast 🤫🧏‍♂️,btohqsg
i surprisingly get along ok with my poly classmates,btohqsg
i get along very well with my two deskmates and i still hangout with my jh friends,btohqsg
everything after 6 is online lecture,btohqsg
eh wait i showed this alr,btohqsg
nobody telling anyone to make a dozen friends..as long as you can make 1 or 2 close friends from every significant moment in your life can alr,btohqsg
but i js feel that grades is just a number is also like very idealistic viewpointbecause everyone can say grades is just a number but what about those people who didnt get the grades to go to the sch/uni they want,btohqsg
since grades is just a number we should just let anyone go to any sch/ uni course they want since grades is not important  so why should schools care about grades anymore ?,btohqsg
it is for some people though,btohqsg
anyway grades is just a number for Yt,btohqsg
Who got PENTA U for alvl🥳🥳,btohqsg
At 30  your grades is your networth,btohqsg
Gpa is no longer impt when you have -2.96 kids,btohqsg
i was inspired by this and proceeded to get a 1.5,btohqsg
and why do u have to sacrifice one for the other,btohqsg
for me is my NS friends are the ones that we still actively keep in contact everyday,btohqsg
what did you do with them,btohqsg
ORD in 2004So that's like 20 years ago,btohqsg
btw offtopic but were you activated for the jurong island checkpoint in nov 2003,btohqsg
Yea i ate them with chili sauce 😋 10/10 meal would def recommend,btohqsg
We did do ops bacinet at Sembawang Wharf,btohqsg
No i will try that next time. Thanks for. the suggestion !!,btohqsg
wont be for another 20 years at least,btohqsg
According to the reddit post it seems like op is a girl so op should sign on to solve her problem,btohqsg
ya thats why i said too early to say BUT ive been charting with them since february,btohqsg
I remember some dude swim in a huge puddle of water for 5 bucks,btohqsg
Idk whats wrong w the hate for smokers,btohqsg
Like smokers should die all that,btohqsg
Wait i see if i can find anot,btohqsg
But generally is like you smoke your whole fam die kind,btohqsg
sorry i will study 12 hours and one second to get 91rp,btohqsg
Eh whr this person get his friends from i oso wan,btohqsg

Its always the extreme ends make the loudest noise mah,btohqsg
https://www.instagram.com/reel/C4S5uVSvTdp/?igsh=eWx1ZXV1emZicjZ3been seeimg this sch on my fyp alot lol,btohqsg
If your opinion is like bland ofc not gonna get alot upvoted,btohqsg
sorry i will take every diploma plus and every UPP ever,btohqsg
so i can apply for sutd,btohqsg
Reddit for mr know it all peoples,btohqsg
i use the reddit to teach people how to get a girlfriend in poly,btohqsg
yes actually i had a dude try to molest me 4 times in two days,btohqsg
the discord is pretty dead rn,btohqsg
he needs to take every diploma in every country to do that,btohqsg
i must also compete in every single olympiad,btohqsg
Take A lvl while u are doing it too,btohqsg
i take alevel + diploma + dip plus + n level + olevel + ib + psle + ucat,btohqsg
u gg ite if u na,btohqsg
do yall know about the one dude who said he would apply to caltech via olevels,btohqsg
my bad guys im going 🤢overseas🤢,btohqsg
"and he also was like ""physicists are better than engineers""",btohqsg
"""engineers are an insult to physicists""",btohqsg
he sounds like sheldon from big bang theory,btohqsg
"""i got sjpo silver i can go caltech""",btohqsg
he also failed his amath prelim,btohqsg
because he forgot how to do logarithims,btohqsg
guys i didnt get silver for sjpo can i still make it to caltech,btohqsg
wait senpai was jason chen alr in the sch in ur time,btohqsg
Engineers prolly do more shit for society in gen like directly,btohqsg
uhh it's not a hot take bc their roles are fundamentally diff?,btohqsg
one doesn't exist without the other,btohqsg
oh ya he was bragging about his reaearch attachment...?,btohqsg
man i'm going to discord to find this,btohqsg
the fact he'd say things like that in sec sch when there's people like yomo there,btohqsg
"""i want to apply to caltech with olevels""",btohqsg
mf was talking about feynmans trick for logs,btohqsg
these people are the kind that needs to get validation that they're smart,btohqsg
half of it is within your O lvls. Very doable,btohqsg
8 hours of physics every day wow so impressive,btohqsg
ye but gahhh been too distracted from studying,btohqsg
lol physics olympiad is like year 1 of undergrad physics,btohqsg
oh yeah he was begging people to join his sphl team,btohqsg
if he's so smart surely he can do it himself,btohqsg
i think man might need recap,btohqsg
he said he learnt H2 physics in 3 months for sjpo,btohqsg
lets bet if hes fr or not fr,btohqsg
that one i wouldn't be too surprised bc sjpo is really not that hard if you prep,btohqsg
for all we know he's legit damn good at physics but sucks at other subjects,btohqsg
just the way he talks about going caltech using sjpo...,btohqsg
that sort of thing a bit cringe,btohqsg
oh yea and the physicist vs engineer comment,btohqsg
same  but he got so triggered when someone compared engineering to physics,btohqsg
"just search ""engineer"" in the messages from him",btohqsg
Eh can i ask whats the diff between eng and physics? If udm explaining,btohqsg
Eng start with E while Physics start with P,btohqsg
physics is science engineering is math,btohqsg
I thought the engineer and physics is just a joke,btohqsg
theoretical physics: using math  computer simulations those sort of thing to understand and figure out how diff things work (in theory)experimental physics: build experiments based on these theories to test their validity or maybe optimizeengineering: make use of these verified concepts and apply them to real world problems,btohqsg
He is trying so hard to be like sheldon,btohqsg
So yall find the theory but dont apply it to real life,btohqsg
Karmas a bitch i shouldve known better,btohqsg
Urs is more theoretical or experimental?,btohqsg
depends on the field. like for example  if a physicist figures out a theoretical way for a new type of semiconductor  experimentalists will try to create it  and after a ton of refining and testing  at some point  it may become commercially available for companies to use it in chips etc,btohqsg
i swear people rarely talk about civil engineering,btohqsg
only condensed matter physics is relevant !1!1!1!1!1!!,btohqsg
Physicists research and think  engineers create it out,btohqsg
If engineers disappear humanity is gone,btohqsg
Engineering in SG has the lowest cut off because it has among the highest intake.Supply and demand situation,btohqsg
Ngl its very sad when your kid goes to school happily and comes home in a box,btohqsg
what to do  the impression given to them because of locals not understanding what's happening  is that engineering is a dumping ground  when it's not,btohqsg
It's funny also because the intake size keeps increasing,btohqsg
There's 1000% some governmental push lol,btohqsg
high demand  but not enough salary,btohqsg
I want to study underwater basket weaving in uni,btohqsg
