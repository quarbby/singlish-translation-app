Btw fr respect to those ppl that have 0 space at home at doing well in poly,btohqsg
yea  btw have you seen TIB 1234 H at depot?,btohqsg
my friend in tm doing bio medical   he said  he has so little space in his house. when his room door closes  it barely scrapes pass his chair he does work on,btohqsg
shared room wiht his siblings  apparently a 3 room apt,btohqsg
nope he does it on a chair or floor,btohqsg
Can leave it there overnight or need keep,btohqsg
Like everytime need use must take out bag then done need put back in,btohqsg
dk  but does not sound conducive at all,btohqsg
oh yea  must take out then keep again,btohqsg
Yeah then not good unless he can leave laptop and do that all day without anyone complaining,btohqsg
Fr need figure out how tf they get sht done,btohqsg
im tryna get sht together but no motivation,btohqsg
If i had a gf or some sht rn  i wouldn't even be at home bruh,btohqsg
the way he described  sounds like it look like this,btohqsg
I got a friend in biomed in tm right now  I can ask him,btohqsg
Wah u going for eae ah?,btohqsg
gais  i have one qn: how much does a poly course affect ur chances at a uni major (disregarding GPA),btohqsg
Dont come here unless you have willpower to study and get what you want,btohqsg
(MI alumni that did not have the willpower),btohqsg
I alr feel the urge to start clubbing and to waste my life away,btohqsg
The only club you should be going,btohqsg
Is go home and study club,btohqsg
I went from one shithole to another,btohqsg
I wouldnt call my experience in MI that horrible but ok yeah maybe sometimes it felt like a shit hole,btohqsg
Im only half a year in and i alr feel some of the teachers arent even qualified to teach us,btohqsg
And the students there oh my å¤©,btohqsg
Oh students are hit or miss,btohqsg
I think most of the qualified teachers left MI as soon as i graduated lmao,btohqsg
Theres only one sane person in my class,btohqsg
Assuming it fails under the relevant diploma list and the same co-curricular positions and activities with the same awards fuck all.,btohqsg
Also I am 1000% percent sure TP has no Biomedical Science.,btohqsg
I am flattered at your reciprocity,btohqsg
Some degree like med need specific diplomas but if the degree uw in uni doesnt need any specific diploma then i think ur GPA is king followed by the porfolio and ur interview performance,btohqsg
Insn't this biomed or is this new,btohqsg
It literally says Biotechnology right there,btohqsg
That friend I have is in biomedical engineering,btohqsg
Which is different that's in the engineering cluster and doesn't fall under a relevant diploma for admission into local med.,btohqsg
I got friends in both biotech and biomed  idk which one she wants. I'll just ask both lol,btohqsg
Biotechnology is a different thing all tgt and has even lower admission rates to local med.,btohqsg
Oh anyhow just ask and see what they respond,btohqsg
If not I can ask jc friends also,btohqsg
See what they have to say,btohqsg
That falls under the Alevels syllabus which is also again a totally different thing.,btohqsg
Did u managed to obtain your LEAPS 2.0 records?,btohqsg
i emailed my school no reply,btohqsg
Head down to your school directly. If it's within 6 months it's likely your record is sitting on a file or table somewhere.,btohqsg
