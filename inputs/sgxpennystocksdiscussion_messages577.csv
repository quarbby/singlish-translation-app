✈️Pika World Daily Updates- 25 Nov 2021✈️🎉XPeng: Pika World’s Rising Star🎉Since our commentary on XPeng as our preferred choice of Chinese EV  we have received multiple good news on its earnings result. There is an exciting development beyond the glitter of good 3rd quarter results  and the buzzword is robotaxis.Gross profit margin comes at 13.6%  which is an improvement from 11% in our 2nd quarter—operating profit declines for a good reason. There is a ramp-up of R&D expenditure which could result in better innovation for the company.The company expects to deliver around 34 500 vehicles to 36 500 vehicles for the fourth quarter. The rise in deliveries has been a good sign for the company  and that perhaps the global semiconductor shortage is easing.Progress has also been made for their navigation system  which boosts their confidence in autonomous driving solutions such as robotaxi technologies. Finally  improvement in adaptive cruise control is a mega step towards driver-assistance technologies.Given that this is the first time we hear about robotaxi in their earnings  it is an exciting era for the company. Pika World will be looking for possible re-entry as headwinds from the higher yield environment hamper the technology sector and may provide a rewarding setup.💣Technology hit by higher bonds💸Technology had a sell-off during the week  which points to the inflation fear  as bond yields jumped once more. Nasdaq is hit hard as investors pare down positions on mega tech companies. Recall that the higher bond yields tend to make future profits lesser in value based on current terms.This hurt technology stocks investing aggressively in the current period to generate fat profits in the future.💰Banks stocks to the Moon💳Investors are now pricing in a possible rate hike around June 2022. Hence  the rise in interest rate is giving our position in banks stocks a shine. Moreover  we have also taken a contrarian position on the strengthening of the USD. Both outlooks have been realised  and we see banks profiting more in an era where long term interest rates rise faster than the short-dated rates.Pika World continues to favour bank stocks  and the stance could reward a good set-up moving into 2022.📮What's on the menu today?It is Thanksgiving Day in US and the stock market is closed. Trading will resume half day on Friday.It is 25 Nov  Thursday  at 8 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. The week has been a tough one and Pika World hopes all friends a good march towards a profitable month.,btohqsg

🚀Pika World Daily Updates- 26 Nov 2021🚀🎙The Fed has Spoken🔭The minutes by the FOMC meeting on Nov 2-3 showed Fed officials' heightened discomfort on the persistent nature of the inflation. It comes at a time when the Fed begins tapering its bond purchase. The move is in a critical junction as President Biden is also looking to fill in vacant seats at the Fed.The views shared by the officials is that the prices increase as a result of the reopening pressure primarily and could be temporary. Nonetheless  there is apparent uncertainty by the Fed officials on the degree to which the inflation is transitory and might take a longer time to subside.⌛️Supply Chains Pressure🛢Without a doubt  the Covid-19 Delta variant had made supply chains fragile and supported a high level of demands for goods which further pushed up prices. This can be seen in energy prices as well as nominal wage growth. In addition  higher housing rental costs have been a formidable pressure on inflation as it becomes more pronounced in several parts of the economy.Therefore  there is a consensus to reduce the bond purchase by around $15 billion per month so that the Fed can adjust the federal fund rates depending on the economy's trajectory. Uncle Powell has been a storyteller in convincing the market that interest rate hike is not on the card for the near time. Despite this  minutes did show some members looking forward to a faster rate hike.⚖️Next FOMC Meeting  Dec 14-15💰The December meeting will be a critical moment  especially after the November jobs report and the CPI data. Suppose we continue to see the rise in wages due to a poor labour force participation rate and elevated consumer prices  market participants are likely to price in a rate hike in June 2022 or earlier  given that tapering would have to begin faster.Moreover  a remarkable payroll report and inflation will push the case for an acceleration of tapering. And if that comes  Pika World will be updating on our latest outlook.It is 26 Nov  Friday  at 7.30 am in Singapore and 7.30 pm in New York. We have come to the last trading day of the week. Markets will be trading till 2am in Singapore time. Pika World wishes everyone an enchanting weekend!,btohqsg
