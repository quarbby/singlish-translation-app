Guys after Axs nerf  what methods yall suggest to pay for GE insurance?,btohqsg
I got the hsbc approved around 4days  i guess maybe because i applied both ega and the cc tgt?,btohqsg
uob absolute cashback welcome bonus exclude grab topup?,btohqsg
although it‚Äôs nerfed  but just wanna grab the welcome bonus,btohqsg
Signing up for the HSBC Everyday Global account n i saw this to qualify for the lucky draw. Must create a SingSaver account during promotion period. What if i already have an account created long time ago means i not eligible?,btohqsg
What is the miles card to pay for Telco bills,btohqsg
FYI  you need to spend $2000 in total for two months,btohqsg
Hmm.. making payment with grabpay through AXS app.. but keep failing..,btohqsg
yup  just wanna check if top up is included as part of the spending,btohqsg
Yeah was doing multiple transactions and I guess it stopped me due to the large amount? Lol,btohqsg
Is it true that tomorrow onwards we wont be able to make payments on axs using grab MC or grab QR?,btohqsg
Hi experts  i‚Äôve a question! I‚Äôve reached FRS at 40‚Ä¶ may i know if the sum compounds till 55 or 65(assuming i don‚Äôt withdraw at 55),btohqsg
days before 55 do up CPF shielding  to allow OA > RA. Then bring your SA sum back to top up your remaining RA.then  that‚Äôs how u maximise your CPF to let it compound,btohqsg
If only we still can do that when reach 55 üòÄ,btohqsg
I wonder how come I not receive grab challenge today.,btohqsg
New Grab challenge.$600 top up  spend $500  get 7500 Grab pts = 7500/500= $15$15/$500x100% = 3% rebate,btohqsg
Buy ShopeePay vouchers at $0.01 to easily meet the transaction count requirement,btohqsg
Some did not received the grab challenges.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs random one I realised.Last week my friend received  Grab Challenge but for different top up value.,btohqsg
will HSBC award 4mpd for booking Airbnb?,btohqsg
Hi experts  does anybody know if Investment linked plans (ILP) can be sold to a third party vendor?,btohqsg
Even if can sold likely have to incur huge losses. Maybe 30% losses. In order to attach people to buy. Anyway just guessing,btohqsg
Still any good in supporting grab? Or $600 for your cashback card better.,btohqsg
Thanks! I know endowment plans can be sold but ILP I not sure,btohqsg
Anyone here using webull? I wanna ask if can do daily auto invest?,btohqsg
ILP initial stage not much value 1.. u put in 1-2k maybe cash value less than 100.. all go to set up cost,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of ILP  my one got value haha,btohqsg
If you plan to sell  can shop around Endowment Exchange / REPS Invest / TES Capital  see which one gives you the highest rate (pls remove the links if inappropriate)https://endowmentexchange.com/https://repsinvest.com.sg/https://tesinvest.com.sg/,btohqsg
No set up cost meh? First few years jialat 1,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre intending to cash out I think cannot. But generally for pure investment ilps  the value and the surrender value is different,btohqsg
Only if u surrender then they take the money as set up cost,btohqsg
Hi guys what is the highest interest savings account without any criteria (no salary credit  card spend  increment balance)?,btohqsg
Paying credit card bill via paynow QR on axs - this is free right (or any processing fee)? Thanks!,btohqsg
Thanks! Do you know any that takes your ILP?,btohqsg
If I use shopback pay with HSBC revolution for dining  will it be taking as shopback tx with no mpd or there will be mpd awarded,btohqsg
Hello  is it advisable to replace the UOB Absolute cashback card with the SCB Simply Cash Credit card (1.5% cashback + annual fee waived for 2 years) for grabpay top ups?,btohqsg
(6 + 2)@Wil_Ow  please  send the solution to the arithmetic operation provided within the time amount specified to this group  otherwise you will be kicked. Thank you! (60 sec)Powered by1inch Network,btohqsg
Not much use already after 16th Jan. Get other card with minimum spend,btohqsg
Only the uob absolute and amex true cashback gets cashback from grab wallet topup. The key question is how much use case you have for grab wallet once AXS transactions are no longer allowed.,btohqsg
It's time to look for alternatives,btohqsg
SC SimplyCash does not give any cashback for GrabPay topups,btohqsg
Once TCB amex got nerf grab is dead,btohqsg
But amex TCB still got it's used vs uob amex due to its support SgQR via amex pay in amex app,btohqsg
I see  thanks for your responses! üôè,btohqsg
Does Uob one card spending via ShopBack QR code qualifies it as the monthly spending requirements,btohqsg
Should be classified under dining and can get 4mpd. I double checked the MCC of my dbs wwmc shopback transactions on dbs digibot and the shopback pay transactions at dining establishments are classified under dining MCCs. üôÇ,btohqsg
Cannot have credit card spend leh  already did it for UOB One.,btohqsg
no more already since grabblocked youtrip  so spend it locally,btohqsg
Hmm can have a look at the suggestions in the YouTube video comments,btohqsg
Is it still possible to top up grab for UOB amex today,btohqsg
