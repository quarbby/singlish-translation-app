Oh nice all the coe drop,btohqsg
i still rmb last time 1.88% only HAHHA,btohqsg
Maybe the full loan army will lose some people then,btohqsg
Ya last time change car like change underwear all thinking twice,btohqsg
The rich and wealthy will still change cars like changing underwear. Cars are toys to them. Singapore is attracting millionaire migrants and they will need a car to move around in style,btohqsg
Ya that factor also need to consider. Post covid and geopolitics attracting hnwi like never before. Cars are attracting different group of people. Bottom bracket of car owners now dk want to own car anymore not.,btohqsg
Oct 2021 ocbc still 1.68% 🫠🫠🫠,btohqsg

ppl gna run to buy car now and then gna shoot up agn,btohqsg
@awj_moodu can change car soon liao leh,btohqsg
If the full loan army was used to looking at interest rates and cared about them  the world would be a different place,btohqsg
5 to 10k drop or increase in COE not that much of a difference to most buying new cars anyway,btohqsg
Neither does it affect the used car market as such,btohqsg
honestly  i assume(DONT FLAME ME) full loan army just whack only. idt interest rates affects them that much,btohqsg
I doubt the COE will drop below 100k as long as the quotas remain limited,btohqsg
does anyone knows where is the cheapest car park in raffles place?,btohqsg
hong leong building after 5 or 6pm is per entry,btohqsg
i think one raffles quay too,btohqsg
why wud u park in CBD anyways,btohqsg
Try using carpark rate app by sgcm,btohqsg
just now i went 80 robinson road. one hour 9 bucks!,btohqsg
Season then first you check for availability,btohqsg
question is why did u drive to CBD,btohqsg
cos no one driving except me -__,btohqsg
i go CBD usually take train one,btohqsg
Need wait for people buy my car first,btohqsg
ok...so i just leave the car here,btohqsg
My car in SGCM listing leh hint hint @ admin,btohqsg
the time i go sure crowded,btohqsg
Now you move also need to pay the higher first hour price again,btohqsg

I think he's selling his grocery getter,btohqsg
idk what is his grocery getter,btohqsg
eh wapiang  u one person need how many car sialah,btohqsg
can just go grocery w C63 anot,btohqsg
JUST HOW MUCH DO U NEED TO BUY FOR GROCERY,btohqsg
And his c63 music system not as good,btohqsg
eh walau u dun tell me u got 1 company van,btohqsg
The nearest would be hong lim at chinatown  they have season parking too. Any other areas within Raffles would be at least a minimum of $3/half hour i think,btohqsg
Just gotta be prepared to walk,btohqsg
Winners faster come down collect your vouchers leh! - J,btohqsg
If you're in the office the whole day  that might be your best bet for season parking. just walk to office and back everyday. If you gotta make a few trips out on the daily then will be inconvenient,btohqsg
