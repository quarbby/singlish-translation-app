Ya I search and found it's excluded from the cash back but not sure if it's accounted as spend,btohqsg
If there is no dp on this  call the UOB CSO then,btohqsg
but if something is excluded cashback  why do you still want to incur fees on Cardup to clock spend... worth it meh?,btohqsg
I just want to clock to 500 min spend to entitle for higher interest,btohqsg
there are easier and more efficient ways like buying Dairy Farm vouchers,btohqsg
Many wayshttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82II think uob one saving acct counts insurance as qualifying spend for higher interest.,btohqsg
hi all    anyone experince similar situation where stanchart insist they cant wavied off yearly credit card membership fee ? if yes   will they send a cheque for current cash rebate balance in the account in the event decide not to pay the yearly membership fee .,btohqsg
Hi in order to get the HSGC EGA 1% cashback on Giro transaction  do I need to perform the monthly 5 eligible transactions ?,btohqsg
Thanks. Does paying giro for insurance to insurance co falls under financial institutions (Exclusions),btohqsg
This one I‚Äôm not very sure so I dare not advise. For the fail-proof way  just transfer in 2k  and do 5x fast transfer out every start of the month. No need to worry or think so much.,btohqsg
if you cancel the card before cash rebate is credited/utilised.. it will be forfeited.,btohqsg
Hi guys  apply uob lady get rejected. If I like to buy air tickets usingtrip.comat 1500  should I go for dbs wwmc? However  seems like singsaver does not have much promo.,btohqsg
Dbs altitude first for new user signup bonus,btohqsg
Oh ok I will go take a look. Thank you,btohqsg
Actually the money is still in the card after it's cancelled.Coz long time ago SC auto cancel my Manhattan card  I didn't realize for a year as I still continue to get statement with positive amount. Then I called CSO to get the money transferred to other card.,btohqsg
oh cards can be auto cancelled??,btohqsg
Ya. 1st time hearing it after I chat with CSO  they can't do anything. All my old cards that's no longer available are cancelled,btohqsg
Talking about SCBI just got easy annual fee waiver for my priority visa infinite  I am surprisedI have 2 other useless cards (nus card) that have annual fee in Jan too  i am thinking if to cancel or request for waiverI somehow think the bank has a limit per year  if i waive my useless cards  i may not be able to get waiver later for cards like manhattanI used to like to keep many cards because it may not be easy to reapply@mttelegrammt  can i ask you  or anyoneüôè  for any personal opinion?,btohqsg
hi if my parents are above 65 and started cpf life withdrawal  what will happen to the money in their SA if they did not hit FRS? will the money in their SA go to their RA or go towards CPF life common pool as they are on standard plan,btohqsg
Scb tends to waive cards that u don‚Äôt use. So if u actively use their cards it won‚Äôt be waived,btohqsg
Do you spend a lot on that card?,btohqsg
Not really  I don‚Äôt use my pb visa infinite card and they don‚Äôt give fee waiver,btohqsg
This one by right need $200k to get annual fee waiver but I‚Äôm sure after this message many will come in to say no need and they got waiver.,btohqsg
TLDR: scb is a strange animal these days and I don‚Äôt profess I understand them. They have nonsense savings account strategy these days too. All over the place.,btohqsg
I do have hard time with SCB waiver last yearSo now don't know if to request waiver for useless cards or just cancel..,btohqsg
Their SA should have been gone by now. All should have went into RA  which will be used for CPF life.,btohqsg
U are not alone. Scb is bonkers with their credit card fee waiver since 2024.,btohqsg
Hi guys i have a question. Im just starting investing and planning to invest in the snp 500. Im not sure whether to go with either CSPX on IBKR or CSPX on FSM1. Since im only investing 50 dollars a month  any small trading fees might impact my investment. Do you guys have any suggestions?,btohqsg
Hi guys could I ask a question please. For dbs altitude visa  how long would the points last please? I remember my colleague saying the points for this card does not have any expiry. Could I ask if this is indeed the case and what about the free miles or points which comes free with the card please?,btohqsg
points on the card dun expire,btohqsg
hi still got abit cos still working. so what will happen to the money,btohqsg
In 2-3 weeks time it'll be gone. As long below FRS  will go to RA for CPF life.,btohqsg
If 50 a mth suggest do quarterly or half yearly instead,btohqsg
Hi guys  may i know if flight ticket purchase from airline website is counted as online shopping eligible spend for DBS livefresh or HSBC revolution card?,btohqsg
Can look into SPYL on IBKR,btohqsg
Hi all   when topping up to TNG using amaze wallet . Do I convert the currency to MYR first ? Or just leave it as SGD ?,btohqsg
CSPX in FSM1 via ETF RSP . But u need minimal $100 / month,btohqsg
You will lose in spread but the ETF RSP charge is still waived. so it should still be cost effective for your case,btohqsg
if you go IBKR you will be hit with SGD conversion cost spread. Either that or you change your frequency and see where $2 move the needle,btohqsg
I usually change to myr then load,btohqsg
There is a new Fraser Experience TNC update.. anyone have the detailsit appeared as handphone app notification... you click it the app will open  but the details didn't come out for me and i cannot find it anymore.,btohqsg

Will paying via Amaze using citi rewards qualify for singsaver eligible spend ? Assuming it‚Äôs a regular retail spend at physical shop.,btohqsg
HiFor SCB  i understand how it works for annual fee  BUT  for spending  even if pay in advance  the giro will still deduct full statement amount?Or if advance payment at least 10 days before  will then be excluded from the giro amount? Thanks,btohqsg
Best to check t&c in case they specially add the clause to exclude Amaze.,btohqsg
thanks melvyn. may i check if i vcma 4k to my MA this yr. can i still top up 8k to my SA to enjoy 12k of tax relief?,btohqsg
If i top up to shopeepay or use my card to directly pay the Spaylater bill does it count as eligible spend? OCBC rewards or Citi Rewards. Or top up using UOB Absolute AMEX,btohqsg
Hi guys   can u tell which best credit card overall   ocbc 365 vs uob one ?? . Usuage is bus mrt   food outside   foodpanda  groceries ( Fairprice like that )  taxi(grab)   maybe streaming service,btohqsg
aren't they both bank accounts and not credit cards?,btohqsg
the choice of credit card here will depend on the bank account balance and other details. generally  below 150k  get ocbc 365 account and the card  150k - get uob one account and the card. assuming you are fulfilling other criteria to get max interest.by themselves  the cards are not great,btohqsg
Depends on ur spending too I think UOBone have a min spending of $500 and ocbc365 is $800,btohqsg
My main acc is maybank‚Ä¶so should i deposit in uob acc some of it ?,btohqsg
I may have missed the boat to top up my medisave or has the extra money from the medisave account not been transferred to the OA yet please?,btohqsg
i have made early repayment towards my SCB cards before and the triggered GIRO amount is the reduced payment due amounte.g. $1000 - $100 early (10 days earlier) = $900 GIRO deducted.,btohqsg
You only missed the boat if your employer have contributed to your CPF.,btohqsg

I don't see any contribution but I have hit the target which is weird.,btohqsg
But but but one month contribution also won‚Äôt be $4 000 one shot  would it?Plus there will be payments for shield plans n the like.There is always a chance,btohqsg
So I just got this on my human that is on the BTL invite (2.75%+0.05) for January 2025. I‚Äôm scared to tap on this message later it registers me for some funny program and invalidates my BTL.(My December ADB is higher than my October ADB which is what BTL benchmarks).Anyone know what this ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù is? If anyone dared to click already?,btohqsg
I am thinking was it because the interest for last year was not transferred yet,btohqsg
Idk  if he earns 35k/mth  4k is possible.,btohqsg
I click but don't have anything,btohqsg
But but but there is a cap of $7 400 of contribution. Is it not?,btohqsg
wah lau.. fake notification?!!?!ok thanks for braving it!,btohqsg
Even if that is impossible right as cpf contribution is limited.,btohqsg
The rest won‚Äôt attract any CPF contribution right?,btohqsg
Yes. On 31 Dec before interest was it $71500?,btohqsg
So in theory it is not possible to hit the contribution of $4 000 in a single month.Unless of course he has multiple jobs n all jobs contribute the max.,btohqsg
I need to calculate a bit as my old phone doesn't allow me to log in to cpf app haha,btohqsg
Uhh  use the app/website. Don't based on own calculation. In any case  should be $71500 if no contributions since 1 Jan till now. Best to check your transactions.,btohqsg
Hi quick question  will using UOB krisflyer  uob ladies card and preferred platinum be a wise choice to pay for wedding expenses? (Eg:hotel venue),btohqsg
most important found out the PAYMENT TERMINAL of the place is what mcc first..,btohqsg
this one actually i also want to askif a person say have 3 jobs.. each earning $8k for example..what is the monthly CPF contribution from employer?employee?CPF ceiling how?,btohqsg
This is assuming we are at 8k salary ceiling for cpf contribution?,btohqsg
sorry i meant the annual CPF contribution ceiling,btohqsg
From this page  multiple employers will need to contribute 17% independently up to salary ceilinghttps://www.cpf.gov.sg/service/article/if-i-am-concurrently-employed-by-more-than-one-employer-can-i-choose-to-contribute-cpf-for-one-of-my-employments-only,btohqsg
wow... if i read correctlyEMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION is not cappedemployee contribution CAN be capped (upon application).so technically you can earn EMPLOYER contribution on $24k salary!,btohqsg
(b) There will be no change to the CPF annual salary ceiling of $102 000  which sets the maximum amount of CPF contributions payable for all salaries received in the year  inclusive of both Ordinary Wages and Additional Wages.not sure how the $102k annual ceiling will come into play then... sounds like will be complicated,btohqsg
What else is next without salary or ega,btohqsg
May i know whats the best way to use CC to pay property tax for cashback cards,btohqsg
Hi honey. Anyone using cardup and cc to pay hdb loan?,btohqsg
From what I know it is multiplied by the number of employers you haveSo per employer  it is $37 740 of employer/employee CPF contribution.,btohqsg
If my MA is max out last year. This year by when can I top up before they transfer the excess to the SA ?,btohqsg
Before your company fills up your MA before you do lor.,btohqsg
So is just company contribute deadline  no other hard deadline ? Like interest come in etc,btohqsg
Interest already came in what.. the next time is 11 months later.,btohqsg
Interest already credited n transferred on 31/12 n 1/1,btohqsg
So if max out MA last year. Now the interest come in. Means already cannot top up to MA already?,btohqsg
Refer to your CPF account... BHS is $75500. Topup however much you want till the limit.,btohqsg
If you check your CPF account  you would see a crediting of interest into your MA and a transfer of that interest to either your SA or OA.This is assuming you hit last year BHS of $71 500.,btohqsg
to get the 8K tax rebate for yrself  U can either top up SA ( to FRS) or MA( max BHS) right?,btohqsg
Is this affect everyone? Not in their website and I have not receive any updates in email or app,btohqsg
Any advise on which cb card to use for ntuc learning hub courses pls,btohqsg
for cpf to earn for the extra 1% 1st 60K  if OA $0  the extra  1% will be on SA?,btohqsg
Not sure lei. I received the email and app notification. I would think it is applicable to everyone.,btohqsg
And MA  if SA is below 60K,btohqsg
Employee contribution is capped means employers contribution is cap too  right ? Eg. 20% vs 17%.,btohqsg
If i use my card to directly pay the Spaylater bill does it count as eligible spend? OCBC rewards or Citi Rewards. Or top up using UOB Absolute AMEX will i get 0.3%? or full 1.7%?,btohqsg
we talking about multiple jobs (multiple employers)we already know (quite confirmed) that if you work 3 jobs EACH earning $8k... all 3 employers have to pay the current CAP EACHbut i not sure how it gels with the global CPF contribution ceiling of Employer + Employee... got suggestion it is also x 3... i am not sure about this,btohqsg
What I understand is Not EACH. All are added up to OW ceiling.,btohqsg
Maybe sing investment go savers account. At least protect by SDIC. Interest rate is 2.6% for up to $300k,btohqsg
after 55  after RA formed e.g. to FRS. anything above that will go to OA?,btohqsg
this actually shows it EXCEEDS OW ceiling on monthly basis per employeryou see Employer A and Employer B BOTH have to pay employer contribution..only employee contribution is cappedwhat i am UNSURE is whether all the employer + employee must add up WITHIN $37 400,btohqsg
the interest in RA is from 55-65 goes towards the CPF life pool?,btohqsg
RA interests stays in RA until CPF life payout starts (RA depleted as CPF life premium)  whereafter interest earned on CPF life will go to CPF life payout pool.,btohqsg
If i do not have cardup?,btohqsg
Do you mean shopee pay later?,btohqsg
Beside Maybank which other cards worth to sign up for card up Citi card?,btohqsg
we must determined FRS/EHS at 55 or can do it by 65 b4 CPF life start?,btohqsg
am thinking if can pump RA to ERS  then at 65 b4 CPF life start  down grade to FRS. So we can get the remaining money out from RA with the 4% interest earned from 55-65?,btohqsg
ERS is just a limit. Not an option.,btohqsg
My sensing is this $37 400 cap is per human basis. The multiple employer only allow us to bypass the $8k/month contribution but not the global cap.1 example to back my idea is (based on $6k cap previously)  if u have 18 month salary  ur employer only needs to pay cpf for 17months √ó $6k (the $102 000 cap). Ur 18th month will not attract any mandatory cpf contribution from either u or employer. So it stands to reason it doesnt matter the number of employer,btohqsg
i agree with useems nightmare to track.... and excess will get bounce back.. what a waste?,btohqsg
There's a possibility that employer may have the ability to access cpf system to see how far away you are from global cap  and pay accordingly.Not certain on this though. Could be this excess bounce back method is being employed today if such scenario occurs,btohqsg
Once you transfer/top-up to RA  it will be purely used for CPF life.,btohqsg
then the SMART multiple employer will purposely be the last to pay.. so the bounce back goes to him,btohqsg
Possible. I notice our cpf contribution is usually later than our salary payday. Perharps the gap in this timing is for cpf to work out the numbers and inform employers?Otherwise no reason to make cpf contribution later than payday,btohqsg

Hi everyone and happy new year I have invested in Amundi prime USA fund. I understand there is witholding tax involvedHow do I calculate how much witholding tax will be imposed?Is the tax imposed on the total amount invested or the tax is imposed on the profits?,btohqsg
Yes thanks. saw from one of the videos.  But was wondering in real life who have done and if the returns are worth,btohqsg
Just an example:1. $500 insurance + $509.25 ($500 insurance through CardUp with 1.85% fee) = $1009.252. $1009.25 √ó 3 (months of premiums) = $3027.753. $100 (cashback) √∑ $3027.75 = 3.3% cashback4. 1% (cashback from HSBC EGA GIRO) √ó $1009.25 = $10.095. $10.09 √ó 3 (months) = $30.276. $100 + $30.27 = $130.37 (total cashback for 3 months  might be lesser by $1 due to cashback offset)7. 3.3% + 1% = 4.3% cashback (similarly if calculate with $130.37 √∑ $3027.75)Best if you can stay at least and as close to $300/$1000/$2000 each month.,btohqsg
Means the amount above $100k eg the $500 of $100 500 would not receive the higher interest since it‚Äôs capped at balances of $100k?,btohqsg
Yes. Can check this calc for ocbc 360 reset monthhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/205369,btohqsg
Which card still can earn miles for pregnancy delivery  or hospital?,btohqsg
Hello  for Citi rewards card  there is a minimum annual income of 30k  does that mean gross income or net income?My gross annual income is more than 30k  and have been working for about 6 months since the last time they rejected my application. Called the bank for a reason and they told me to apply again and try.But during the application my assesable income is slightly below 30k. What does that mean?,btohqsg
Should be gross income. I think don‚Äôt worry and just apply.If you get rejected you should also get a free credit report and see if there‚Äôs any wrong.,btohqsg
yea since its my first credit card the credit report is basically nothing,btohqsg
Ok  I think if Citi rejects you again  just apply for another credit card with a bank you have savings account with.Should be easier that way and it can help you build your credit history. After a few months can apply for Citi,btohqsg
Oh makes sense  but for me Citi rewards is the most suitable for my daily life  will look into the other banks and see which matches more closely next. Thanks!,btohqsg

Do you earn a fixed salary per month or variable income?They generally give more weight to fixed income vs variable. (If variable  probably that‚Äôs why they hinted it is below $30k during assessment),btohqsg
fixed income  have a full time employment,btohqsg
I understand that you can't use citi rewards to earn miles for hotel stayBut what if I'm using it with amaze to book for wedding at a hotel  does it still means I wont get miles?,btohqsg

I wanted to check with them the spending for this month has to still be the full $800 or not despite me just receiving the card yesterday  and going overseas.The CS just casually mentioned spending must not be through third party. Which then I asked and it was mentioned example amaze or youtrip which I got confused.,btohqsg
it USED to be a good deal because you get welcome cash rewards PLUS you get to put your cash in a 99.9999% safe Savings account earning high interest rates (it was 5% Wealthsaver last time).NOW different story. I went to see see and there wasn't any details of any promotional savings account.So where will you park your incoming funds then. It might have to be Marathon Esavers account which the rate is meh meh only.So my advice is find out exactly what is the best deal now (don't seem to have any good deals now)... before you dive in.Try not to do for those where you are forced to invest.,btohqsg

"Hi  does anyone knows that whether all Amaze's transaction consider as ""online"" transaction.

"Thanks  but can I clarify that even i use the amaze card to pay for restaurant  it will still clock as ""online"" transaction?",btohqsg
Amaze card changes offline to online without changing the MCC code,btohqsg
I'm not so familiar on the MCC code thingy  I also read that when using amaze  the MCC would retain the original MCC. Then if MCC for dining at restaurant is MCC XXXX  how would it clock as the online MCC.,btohqsg
Everything will be online but you need to ensure the MCC is not excluded for rewards,btohqsg
"Cause the 4 mpd for citirewards only applies to online spending and shopping  thus  asking if dining at restaurant (linked to Amaze)  would consider as ""online"". Sorry for the noob queries. üòÇ",btohqsg
You need to pay through amaze card.By pairing the amaze card  all offline transactions will be converted to online transactions.,btohqsg
So long if you pay through amaze card  it will be online,btohqsg
Take a step back.Mcc is merchant code.Online/offline/contactless is payment method.Amaze changes payment method to online. Tapping amaze card will convert transaction from dining offline to dining online. Mcc doesn't change.,btohqsg

Have to wait till Monday? Previously I always do it during weekdays and funds populate in my ibkr after 1 hour plus.2) if my funds do come in to iBKR  and I do a sgd conversion to usd and buy some more etf  since LSE is closed  will the etf be bought or it will wait till Monday when LSE opens?

Hi all  will 4 miles per dollar ( will be converting miles for shipping voucher)  or 2.5% cashback make more sense ? Thanks,btohqsg
It depends on individual. No right no wrong.. those who doesn‚Äôt like to travel  it make sense with 2.5% cashback. Those spend little n can‚Äôt hit target to redeem airticket when the miles is going to expire  it makes sense.,btohqsg
Ok. Which card are you talking about? And which shopping vouchers are you taking about?Usually these cases using miles for flights  esp biz flights  is better.,btohqsg
Nah‚Ä¶..then they will take a conservative view n tell you someone will get back to you on Monday.,btohqsg
They divide into dine shop travel right...?So u may hit the total spend but may not get the full $88.. Correct  me if sala,btohqsg
From my understanding  you will get $88 so long you can hit the spending requirement  regardless of category,btohqsg
Just a thought on RSTU. I just noticed from the dashboard that I am a few hundreds away from FRS. Can I invest 8K using SA  and then after top it up with another 8K for tax relief?,btohqsg

Not yet. But the dashboard stated I can only get 900+ for tax relief for topping up to SA.,btohqsg
In a year can do 8k top up to oneself. Since is few hundred will u consider OA to SA? So Jan the MA top up also u didn‚Äôt perform right?,btohqsg
You can only top up amount up to FRS. In his case  he can only top up 900+ to get tax relief,btohqsg
Of cos  if he did MA 4K at least plus SA 900+,btohqsg
Thanks  I forgot about the new BHS.My RSTU is done through GIRO with EGA. May I know if I can also do a GIRO arrangement for VCMA?,btohqsg

"Hey guys  wondering if you guys Faced such instance with UOBFor example 12th every month is a statement end date.However it has been a few months where by postings on the 12th is considered the into  previous month statement not on the ""new""This causing an issue for me as Jan is actually the first month quarter lol.Talking to uob assistant is triggering and not helpingThey told me ""depends on system and 12th is cut off date""",btohqsg
Hi guys  I‚Äôm paying quite a lot of rent in SG. What is the best strategy to pay rent with credit card?,btohqsg
Are you saying that say a 12/1 transaction is posted on 12/1  appears in your 12/1 statement but considered as Dec transaction?,btohqsg
Jan makes up of transactions posted 13 Dec to 12 Jan,btohqsg
I see the t&c said this. So strange,btohqsg
see the eligible mcc list  u dun expect them to list down the hundreds of thousands of merchant do u?,btohqsg
This is what I expect I have examples from previous months where by the post days  on the 12th is in the same statementHowever for this Jan cycle they seems to have alr close off my statement so naything posted today considered as Feb. This is throwing my quarter off as irs below 500Do you think able to dispute with uob?,btohqsg
do u actually have transaction posted today on a sunday?,btohqsg
I believe the header of that column say ‚Äòexample‚Äô?,btohqsg
12/1 is a Sunday so the statement got generated on 11/1. (You can confirm your statement date when it is available),btohqsg
I have a simple solution for u which is what I always follow myself.Don‚Äôt do any transactions 3 days before your expected cut off date.And only start new transactions when you see statement has been generated.If cutoff date is 12th normally make sure u hit all your targets by 8th and stop using card until 13th for example.,btohqsg
Matter of fact I actullt doOct12This bring to my attention that my statement changed to 13oct lol,btohqsg
Yeah so if use my method you are still safe.You would have hit target by 8th October. And only start using card again when u log in on 13th and see new statement generated.,btohqsg
It's  in Oct statement (post date 12th Oct) which is what I would expect but doesn't seem to apply to Jan (today),btohqsg
cos 12 Jan is sunday. Unlikely transaction post in a Sunday.,btohqsg
Usually when touch weekends or holidays it‚Äôs always iffy. Don‚Äôt expect statement date or even posting cycles to follow what you have been observing. Have some buffer,btohqsg
So Sundats/weekends/publicholdiay  was the key difference I supposedYou guys think it's worth while to bring this up to uob? Or Q1 cashback is alr gone and dusted,btohqsg
Can try appealing and asking. They are usually quite lenient to give exceptions once a year per customer.,btohqsg
There is a methodology to this üòä,btohqsg
Haha too complicated for me. I just make sure I hit my targets 3-5 working days before my usual statement cutoff.,btohqsg
Thanks! Will hit them up i dont think the live chat will work.Speaking to the live chat is like talking to the wall they can't communicate properly.How to go about appealing?,btohqsg
Yeap Yeap üòäMake sense for SG based or online merchants. Should be safe.  (unless the 3 buffer date are PH/Sunday)Overseas not so sure.The trigger for the transaction to get posted is not in our hands. It is in the merchant hands.,btohqsg
Overseas i use 7 days buffer. Seriously.,btohqsg
Tell live chat cso to submit an appeal to consider the transaction you want as part of the cycle u need.,btohqsg
Good one.Unless the merchant does not want their $$$ which occasionally happens,btohqsg
Of course sometimes u hit those funny merchants like car rental and hotels and airlines and Apple. Their actual payment methods might not be what u expect.Charge then release then recharge. Those I have no solution. Have to appeal Loh if really fell into traps.,btohqsg
should be old news but in case its not shared,btohqsg
And is overseas need to consider their public holidays tooLike in TW  the CNY holidays is about a week or moreIn Indo  there is extended holidays end of Jan.All these may impact on when your transaction gets posted into your account,btohqsg
Has anyone facing payment issue using foodpanda direct dbs yuu card? Mine always fail though dbs app approve trans.No issue if payment using google pay,btohqsg
just curious what kind of transactions posted today (Sunday)?,btohqsg
Yaaa  same. Was trying to redeem code payment keep fail. Then restaurant closed üòê,btohqsg
That's another issue I didn't think about...I only notice the descrpancy on the dates sigh,btohqsg
lol if no transaction posting today then nothing to dispute bah,btohqsg
CardUp if your landlord accepts CardUp payment,btohqsg
Yeah anyways thanks for your help your comments makes alot of sense. And probably the reason why it closes off on the 11th this month cause 12th its a sundayTime to stash the uob card for 2 months then,btohqsg
I think Gerald may be expecting the transaction to be posted tonight (12/1) but since today Sunday the cutoff for the statement became yesterday (11/1)So kind of 1 day of transaction expected but will come in the only in Feb 12/2 statementcmiiw,btohqsg
For gerald's situation  does changing cc statement generation date makes it easier to track? Eg. Statement generate every end of month,btohqsg
If the date falls on a Sunday/PH  same scenario will pan out,btohqsg
Like 31/3 (Monday) will be a PH so statement should be generated on the previous last work day which is 29/3,btohqsg
transactions unlikely to post on today since it is Sunday,btohqsg
What is the best credit card (for either cashback or miles) for grab? Currently using citi rewards,btohqsg
I think you got a good card already,btohqsg
Cashback side has UOB one and Maybank FnF but both have min spend.,btohqsg
Try to contact live chat during business hours. Outside of that they can only ‚Äútake a message‚Äù,btohqsg
Also after i switched to dcs flex I noticed that all those transactions not posting on sundays and public holidays are pretty much just an UOB issue not really the merchants‚Äô,btohqsg
For statement that has closing date falls on Sunday  the last day of posting is previous day that is Saturday. The next posting date is next working day that is Monday. If next Monday is a public holiday  it will be posted on next Tuesday that is next month statement.Usually For those who want to earn the interest  all transactions shall be done 4-5workingdays in advance before closing date.,btohqsg
can i check how long did the appealed rebate take to credit to your card? is it next month?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what I mentioned in my earlier post.It is not unlikely. It is 100% certain.,btohqsg
Haha sadly got a lot of JIT warriors,btohqsg
Used to be not good but now interest rates are falling. Still not worth imo cuz you only get benefits at around 100k deposit.,btohqsg
I usually think the interest from UOB One account is more important. If feeling cannot hit $500 four working days before closing  will go n buy vouchers etc.. Die die must hit n posted $500 few working days in advance.,btohqsg
Missing that 500$ interest is a lot tbh haha.,btohqsg
Ya. But every month sure have people ask the same question.,btohqsg
the key issue is the additional miles is capped at 5% of the deposit amount,btohqsg
some transactions on dcs flex did post on sundays and public holidays,btohqsg
I‚Äôm actually interested in KF uob acc too up promo. 180k KF miles for $300k earmarked for 3 months. Thereafter move out the funds.,btohqsg
Money keep in this account only earn 0.05% interest. Basically it means you are paying $$ to UOB to buy the miles.Assuming interest 4% from $100k  you are paying $986 to UOB to buy 45 000 miles?Or with 3%  you are paying $739 to buy 45 000 miles?Above is just an estimation.,btohqsg
I‚Äôve looked into credit card options for cardup  and there isn‚Äôt a credit card where you can earn more than 1% return after fees in miles. Is this true? Which credit card would best pair with cardup to pay for rent?,btohqsg

100 quarterly rebate if meet 1k spend each month of the quarter. Max 3.33%  spend above 1k but below 2k dun earn anything,btohqsg
Say my rent is 3k  will I be earning 3.33 on all of that plus tier 3 of 300?,btohqsg
If you pay 3k before fees  then you'll only get $200 per quarter. So 2.22% effective cashback  before fees.,btohqsg
Any Chinese New Year new credit card offers?Are these a thing?,btohqsg
Of course calculating after fees (w/ 1.79% promo by CardUp)  your total fees per quarter is $161.10  leading you to an effective cashback of 0.43%.,btohqsg
Yea understood  I‚Äôm thinking about getting a second card for this for the remaining amount beyond 2k,btohqsg
Understanding the best card for cash back would be Maybank plat  will any miles card make sense? I could not find one that does,btohqsg
It can also be a cash back card if making at least 1% after fees,btohqsg
If you count singsaver as onehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/260001,btohqsg
The trigger is the merchant to their bank (acquiring bank). And looks like DCS rubs their posting on every day. But UOB is not the only bank in SG that does not do posting on Sunday‚Äôs n PH.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why done banks prefer cust the transaction date instead of posting date to calculate. Less dispute  n clearer.,btohqsg
You can use CardUp's calculator to check for eligible cards and rewards.,btohqsg

I think I worked out before. It was actually quite an ‚Äúok‚Äù miles buying deal.,btohqsg
With all the questions I actually went to dig dig dig. It seems ok woh! Why? Because of the 5 or 6 miles bonus u get on 5% of mab.If u plonk $300k cash into krisflyer account. U can earn max of 15 000 miles per month from spend bonus (on top of usual credit card spend)Sweet spot is:$2500 spend per month with salary credit$3000 spend per month without salary creditI might do it myself. Once again this demonstrates sharing is caring. I try to answer questions and go dig dig dig. End up I benefit myself.Thanks all.,btohqsg
This is fake la.I would treat it as 180k miles x 1.5 cents = $2 700 value.The other big component is the 4 months of 15k bonus = 60k miles or $900 valueOn top of your usual miles on the card used.$3600 / $300 000 for 4 months = 3.6% pa.It‚Äôs fairly decent especially if u feel savings account rates will be coming down.Heck even HSBC EGA is 4.1% now only.,btohqsg
This is the highest and most worth it tier.However I noticed a big auxiliary benefit to doing this.Your krisflyer debit card can earn 5 miles per dollar if u maintain $300k adb.,btohqsg
And HSBC ega rate already went down.,btohqsg
Still got 3.8% la. But of course can go down again‚Ä¶. Hahaha,btohqsg
Hmmm dont think it's worth it at all  considering we can get miles easily.,btohqsg
in this case it makes sense to only pay $1964.83 per month to cardup  the excess $1035.17 paynow directly to landlord. effective cashback of 1.05%,btohqsg
It is partially due to merchant. If merchant don‚Äôt submit  nothing you as customer can do.,btohqsg
I had this  acct and had 30k inside.Just collect miles every month from this acct  and transfer out the funds when I am done with,btohqsg
Can I buy a phone as installment while clocking minimum spending?,btohqsg
Via bank installment  most likely no.,btohqsg
Did u work out the effective benefit level / rate?,btohqsg
Yes.Miles rewarded is 5% of your MABIf you had 20k in acct . Then u be awarded 1000 miles,btohqsg
But u don‚Äôt get paid any cash interest. So was it worth it?As a comparison if the $30k cash was put into HSBC EGA at 3.8% pa now it could have earned you $95 a month,btohqsg
It all depends on what u after right?The acct is 0.05% interest PA. If u are after $$. Then this acct will not work for u,btohqsg
And there won't be best of both worlds,btohqsg
Alternate between EGA with KF uob acc is an alternative probably.,btohqsg
You need to spend on eligible cards to be given miles up to 5% of your MAB. Just parking money won't get miles,btohqsg
Unless your KF for the fresh fund promo which give miles for earmarking your money for 3 months,btohqsg
I got a question to ask. Currently my giro payment to credit card is paying by my UOB one account. What should I do to stop the giro before I setting up through payment by my EGA account,btohqsg
just setup giro with hsbc ega  the banks will do the change,btohqsg
I am using the KF CC as well.So far had been using it. And haven tried not using to see if the miles are still credited or not,btohqsg
Any idea what‚Äôs the the best card to use with Kris+?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
Generic online cards like dbs wwmc or amaze + crmc (no travel). Else  UOB KF without restrictions.,btohqsg
$30k get extra 1 500 miles? Means $95/1 500 =$0.06 cpm üò±,btohqsg
yes  but usually merchants submit  it's UOB that doesn't post on sundays and PH,btohqsg
Ikr hence my friendly query but met with hostile response. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Does the uob lady's card 5$ dollar blocks is total of the month or single transaction,btohqsg

Most likely the bonus will be delayed till April.,btohqsg
my points stopped updating since 16 dec :')i think we can try to calculate it on our own. it's a little confusing tbh  because at the start of each month it's +XXXX. can try to backtrack,btohqsg

Hi all  for citibank rewards - does $1 spending (base reward) both card equate to 1 point for redemption ? Thanks.,btohqsg
For context  is the usage of the term 1 mile and 1 point interchangeable for citibank ?,btohqsg
Citi has 2 currencies. One is Citi miles  which is 1 Citi mile eq 1 airline mile. Second is thank you points  which 2.5 thank you points is equal to 1 miles.,btohqsg
Citi rewards 1$ on eligible transaction will get 10 thank you points  or 4 miles.,btohqsg
Citi is confusing because have multiple currencies that are not pooled and not same ratio. üëéüèª,btohqsg

For RA ERS  is it a must to contribution to max 4x or can be any amount? Example 400k ERS  but can I transfer to 300k instead for slightly higher monthly payout?,btohqsg

Hi  I quite confuse  for EGA bonus interest  is it for 1 or 2 months  I join EGA bonus interest this month  I need to shift my fund to human B next month in order to get bonus interest? Or I can stay in my AC for 2 months?,btohqsg
Oh no I  just realised from SMS  if I had joined EGA bonus on Nov  it means I can't join on Jan 25  right?,btohqsg
2 months. You can stay for 2 months but you will lose 1% p.a. from Everyday+ Rewards. You will also not be able to join the following promo with the existing monies (have to skip a month).,btohqsg
Can. Always refer to t&c and not SMS.,btohqsg
The following month only get 2.8%? So it better move to human B? But human B joined Dec promo  the increment base on Jan  right?,btohqsg
Yes assuming the promo you're on is 2.8% p.a. Yes. No  reference month is Nov for Dec promo.,btohqsg

Hi  would like you check with you experts my math on the UOB KRIS account $100 000 for 45 000 miles.Assuming I put in this 18th jan month the $100 000. Earmark starts from 18 Feb and ends 18 may. Effectively a period of 4 months.I also can hit the spend for the bonus 5% MAB of the $100 000 which will grant me the 5 000 miles each month. (Which is only $1 000 spent without salary crediting)1. 45 000 miles from the earmark promo2. 4x5000=20 000 miles from the bonusMy effective miles earned over the 4 months are Total 65 000I did not include base miles of 1.4 MPD for my prvi card because with or without the account I also earn them.Assuming I am able to get 4.6% p.a for this $100 000. 4 months = $1 533Meaning $1 533/65 000 =$0.02 cpm!??,btohqsg
Haven't checked the maths but 4.6% pa in this low interest environment is a bit overestimating,btohqsg
Hi  can i check anyone gotten their hsbc ega account review/ restricted?Unable to make any transactions.,btohqsg
i calculated it as APPROX 2.9% p.a. interest assuming you value miles at 1.5 cents per mile.65k miles = $975 value975 x 3 = $2925$2925 / $100000 = 2.925% p.a.Great or not? up to your personal miles valuation.My benchmark remains HSBC EGA at 3.8% p.a. currently.,btohqsg
Nope just regular paynow and giro for insurance etc,btohqsg
are the PAYNOW all same first party name... or involved 3rd parties,btohqsg
I think maybe got 3rd parties. But mostly to my wise account,btohqsg
HSBC doesn't like third parties.I remember 1-2 years ago  i was told by the EDD officer than my review was triggered just because of a SINGLE $80k transfer in by one of my household humans (different name than me of course).,btohqsg
I see cso told me they can hold my account 1-2 mths depends. Any tips or advice to deal with this ?,btohqsg
someone should reach out to you...just be honest and provide all the information they ask for.they are concerned with your money being clean or not. They don't care about rewards earning..,btohqsg
I see ok. Been a week already no one called. Going to branch wont help right ?,btohqsg
I am currently using the OCBC 360 and getting the 4.65% with salary and savings atm.,btohqsg
this one i don't know so i don't want to anyhow say.but if you are free and urgently need help  you could try going down to branch,btohqsg
If I have FRS  and I know I get some payout each mth after 65  what happen to the balance if I kick the bucket at 68. Will the remaining balance be diluted  when passed down to children?,btohqsg
Best advice is to check with CSO or at physical branch.,btohqsg
Does anybody knows  if i scan the paynowQR code with google pay  would the money be deducted from my CC or the balance i have in paylah?,btohqsg
paylah (if that is the bank account being linked),btohqsg
Ocbc srs limit still 0... Haiz,btohqsg

For UOB ppv it's eligible for 7011?,btohqsg
Uob KF is 3mpd uncapped for 5812  assuming you can hit 800$ on SIA groups.Else refer to#bts,btohqsg
Ohhh I thought you guys making fun of me! Hahaha,btohqsg
If can pay online for MCC 5812  the best option may be Citi SMRT 5% cashbackhmsg.link/citismrt,btohqsg
Omg thanks! Seriously uncap?! That‚Äôs insane,btohqsg
I prefer miles but I see the 5% cash back is quite on par. On the mpd,btohqsg
You wont get 4mpd for 5812 on the old OCBC titanium anyway,btohqsg
Yes uncapped. Beware of its quirks  like 800$ spend on SIA group req  1.2mpd will come first and 1.8mpd will only come when membership year ends.,btohqsg
Yes. Just need to do mobile contactless.,btohqsg

only can get base points on cardup/ipaymy. Some cards to consider are dbs vantage for 1.5mpd and uob prvi for 1.4mpd,btohqsg
Wow. There is 3 different kinds for UOB prvi. I guess VISA version is the best? I remembered there are some VISA card promo on cardup from time to to time,btohqsg
Amex PRVI has free Home to Airport limo if you can hit a certain FX spend.,btohqsg
Can I apply both versions of the card?,btohqsg
But I need to spend the $800 first before my BTS right? If not it will be 1.2? Or could it be within the year then miles credited 1.8 end of membership year?,btohqsg
always comparing this perks with uob VS  not sure which 1 is better,btohqsg
Try GxS. Can withdraw anytime. 2.98%,btohqsg
I'm applying now. But should I fill up my Krisflyer number first? And what is Asia miles?,btohqsg
yes should fill up. Asia miles is to redeem flight from cathay pacific,btohqsg

So bad the amaze card. Last week i found my amaze card have some transaction happened  so i contact with live chat and tel the story and request to replace a new card. After once day i found my account is suspended  then i try to use chrome to login to contact with live chat also  until now my account still suspended and my replacement card also received on today.,btohqsg
Just now they info to me (We regret to tell you that you may not be able to continue with Instarem as the current account is permanently blocked and cannot be reactivated.) during this happened is my fault?,btohqsg
I found some suspect transaction and inform to them  this also get suspended accounts. Some more i also unable the overseas without and oversea remitted. This is have this happened,btohqsg
Like your credit card found some unauthorized transaction just call to center and replace the card   they don't have suspended your account right? Why amaze have this policy  so bad.,btohqsg
Maybe they suspect your account is compromised,btohqsg
But account only amaze card. The account without any amount inside,btohqsg
Like your credit card  if your cc found some unauthorized movement  the bank willl block your account? No   right?,btohqsg
Yes but bank account different from amaze account. Amaze account can be hacked easily  hence they might decide to block just in case.,btohqsg
Meaning is if your report and suspect account be hack then not more to use ameze account in further. Hahaha. Only allow you to report once time in life. Haha,btohqsg
not true... i changed amaze card a few times before due to fraud.they just blocked the card and sent a new one within 2 weeks... life goes on,btohqsg

recently a lot of complaints about singsavermaybe they chop too many staff and cannot cope,btohqsg
Without any oversea used between this 2-3.months. just SGD used.,btohqsg
Maybe they think you don‚Äôt need the card. They mainly earn money from your fx transactions. If you only use it in SG  they don‚Äôt earn much.,btohqsg
Hi quick question. Now is 8pm sg time. If I were to deposit funds to my ibkr account via dbs  will the funds be in my ibkr within an hour or 2 or will it be tommorow since now banks are not office hours,btohqsg
Then need to mention about this on t&c.,btohqsg
Just try to contact them and ask if you can re-activate the account. They might need to verify details before they decide if they can reactivate it for you. My mom‚Äôs account is hacked and suspended since mid-Dec. We have been communicating with them and they are in the process of reactivating the account.,btohqsg
Already try and ask. They reply this,btohqsg
Try to apply another new account?,btohqsg

Since 20 Dec  still not settled yet. Have been getting updates from them though that they are in the midst of re-activating my mom‚Äôs account. Not sure what will be the final outcome though.,btohqsg

It‚Äôs all good until sth bad happens ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
What do you mean ‚Äúhack‚Äù? Is it your card had fraudulent transactions?,btohqsg
They suspect hack. But I don't think so.,btohqsg
Actually cc is not so easy to get hack. 16 digit plus ccv 3 digit.,btohqsg
Toto 9 digit also very difficult.,btohqsg
Difficult but not impossibleOnly 6 digit as the 1st 6 is fixed. And last 4 is usually display in many places.If you know the algorithm  you will know how to get the rest of the 10,btohqsg
Just like the NRICdisplayed everywhere is the last 4  if you know year of birth  you can reverse engineer the full number.,btohqsg
Very easy to hack. Either use computer to brute force or when you use it in shops  the staff takes a picture of it will do.You did lock the card when not using it or set it to empty wallet ?,btohqsg
first 6 digit is issuer and bank identification number  only the 7th - 15th is your actual 'random number'  16th is the checksumoh and the ccv is not required for some retailer  expiration doesn't proof anything  your card generally expire in 2-5 years at most  how many number is that,btohqsg
I use amaze card more sequence.,btohqsg
hi bro ..can we include incoming salary credit together with save as well?,btohqsg
Sorry I must ask a rude question. Do u do anything potentially suspicious for them to ‚Äúban‚Äù you?Like frequent refunds? Withdrawal? Or suspicious merchant types?,btohqsg
Yes but always best to keep it to as close as 500 increment MAB.,btohqsg
I also curious.. this case I won't even say rare  but one of a kind.Other suspicious activity I can think of is having physical transactions at different merchants within short period of time (5 mins?).,btohqsg
thinking of applying with my new company..ask them credit salary here ..alamak... then when salary comes in  a few K...u mean ...faster shift out the amount right?,btohqsg
sorry mel.. I'm still searchiing up history and reading up...as not to re-ask frequent question,btohqsg
If you are doing it yourself the salary transfer you properly know the exact date it is in. Why not just set a scheduled transfer out as well. That way the MAB is certain to be $500.,btohqsg
Doesn't matter how you do it as long MAB increment by $500. Best way is to withdraw all salary credit while deposit on 1st day.,btohqsg
eh? 360 can also self paynow sala like one account? i'm currently on 1 account,btohqsg
"What do you mean by ""doing it yourself""? Salary credit?",btohqsg
i always transfer out the salary on the day itself.,btohqsg
oh ...ok....then set transfer out same day as new company's payday lor...hehe...thanks thanks u!,btohqsg
Yes. He mentioned he creating a company to transfer himself the salary.,btohqsg
What's a good card after maxed out citi amaze card.,btohqsg
He did not mention that. He mentioned applying for the account and get salary credited from his new company.,btohqsg
who? me? ya...my new job AKA new company..lol..not DIY one..haha,btohqsg
Without do anything. No refunds  withdrawal and suspicious merchant before. Some more this unauthorized transaction also don't have to credit to my account  since when transaction is general automatically rejected  since i unable the remittance function.,btohqsg
Guys  if we were to pay via Atome 3 months 0%  only the first payment is considered eligible spend right?,btohqsg
This unauthorized transaction is remittance  not a in-store merchant,btohqsg
2nd and 3rd payments are eligible spend too.,btohqsg
This amaze card i just add to my GPay for transport like bus and train traveling use and go to supermarket for mobile contactless use. No more other.,btohqsg

If that's how OP also provided info to Amaze CSO  I really not surprised if Amaze permanently suspend the account. The story don't tally  makes it even more suspicious than any kind of fraudulent transaction...,btohqsg
CardUp transactions are not eligible for UOB One card.You can split to multiple transactions for insurance premiums  but some promo codes are limited to one or two usages. So plan well.,btohqsg

Hey all  can you use Amex True Cashback for travel insurance / normal insurance payments (and get cashback on it)? Thanks! :)EDIT: I saw the exclusion list and it seems like insurance is not excluded. But it does say the list is non-exhaustive,btohqsg
Can use and get cashback  but whether they accept Amex is another thing. Don‚Äôt know many providers (if any) that do accept,btohqsg
I also want to know  but they don't tell me just say they policy,btohqsg
That is very strange. Usually those fraudulent transactions are from oversea online transactions.,btohqsg
Good news - can topup TnG with IChange new card,btohqsg
So when the transaction is general immediate rejected.,btohqsg
The question is  does the insurance provider accept AMEX as payment provider? Are you going to hunt that 1 or 2 insurance provider for that miniscule cashback? What if other insurance companies offer you same/better coverage at the cheaper price (cheaper than the cashback given)?,btohqsg
yes  the transaction i show use my amaze to remittance.,btohqsg
so they asked me to apply thru their email and attach my relevant documents.wpndering if anyone applied thru email before and how long does it take for a reply?,btohqsg
If fast it's 1-3 business days  normal it's 3-5 business days and slow it's 5-7 business days. If you want the card just submit the documents  you'll receive the reply when you receive it.,btohqsg

Guys a questionIf i turn 55 in 2026   how much can i withdraw from my OA ?FRS maxed with 300 000 in my OABUTthe 300 000 that i have in my OA  100 000 is with Great Eastern's SP investment plan,btohqsg
you never mention your SA balance,btohqsg
Assuming i have 300 000 in OA + maxed FRS after balance in SA is distributed to my OA and SA already,btohqsg
then it would be $200k which is $300k - $100k with GEactually you should not say you have $300k OA then..you only see $200k in your OA when u log into CPF right?,btohqsg
Whatever that is in SA at 55 + remaining amounts to hit FRS from OA will form RA. Then the rest will stay in OA and will be withdrawable.,btohqsg
What is the withdrawable limit ? Is it unlimited withdrawals and what is the amount for each withdrawal ?Any ways to calculate ?,btohqsg
OA is like savings account... can withdraw anytime,btohqsg
CPF members can make withdrawals from their CPF savings starting from age 55.The amount you can withdraw depends on your birth year and the age you are making the withdrawal. You do not need to withdraw everything; you can withdraw only what you need  when you need it and as often as you need to because with PayNow  you can receive your CPF savings almost instantaneously.https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/tools-and-services/forms-e-applications/withdraw-cpf-retirement-needs,btohqsg
For online .A default online Daily Withdrawal Limit of $2 000 a day is applied to all CPF members aged 55 and above. You can adjust the online Daily Withdrawal Limit up to a maximum of $50 000  at any time underAccount settingsviaSingpass authentication.,btohqsg
Thank you so much üôè Basically OA is like a personal bank account at 55 and the RA is monthly payout from govt right ?,btohqsg
last time did not have this.. but too many scams so they imposed this,btohqsg
yes OA is like personal bank account but only pay 2.5% p.a.,btohqsg
Thank you and the rest for the help   really appreciate itüôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
If you want liquidity then you have to accept lower returns which is similar to other financial products on the market how it is setup.,btohqsg
but bank savings account can pay above 2.5% p.a. nowand even above 3.45% p.a.sorry not sure you referring to CPF or the Singlife,btohqsg
I was referring to CPF difference between OA and RA. The funds in OA can be withdrawn anytime but the interest is 2.5% compared with RA 4% but you have to follow their stricter rules of usage,btohqsg
Can deposit it back anytime after withdraw if above 55?,btohqsg
i think it is one way..after 55.. all topups go to RA... only to boost CPF Life,btohqsg
OA can only out. RA can only in.,btohqsg
Still better to throw OA to tbills now?,btohqsg

Hi  if I want to participate deposit date 1 Feb to 28 Feb  this means I have to empty my account for the whole month of Mar and then start putting money in on 29 Mar and kept it to 18 Jul?,btohqsg
What is considered new? More than a year since last cancelled,btohqsg
More than 12 months with zero citi credit cards,btohqsg
That will be a different promo (2nd quarter). These durations in ur screenshot won't be applicable.,btohqsg
Which offer is a better deal? #1 or #2?,btohqsg
The Uob promo now is very difficult to participate. U need to empty your account for one calendar month before start of the new promo.,btohqsg
depends on how you value miles. For option2  you are essentially buying 22000 miles for $196.2 or 0.89cents per miles  which to me is pretty ok since I value miles around 1.5c/mile. Anything below 1.5 cents/mile is already a profit.,btohqsg
Is Money deducted from your credit card?,btohqsg
Since when this transaction is general immediate rejected.,btohqsg
U can saw the cancel time is same with the initiated on.,btohqsg
Then nobody pay for this transfer unless you have money in the ewallet. Likely Instarem needs to pay for this if the transaction is successful. Correct?,btohqsg
Different date n time. Morning n night time.,btohqsg
No  my e-wallet without any amount.,btohqsg
Haha  i saw it. Hahaha. But I check with them then say cancel immediately and i check with my cc also no this transaction.,btohqsg
My understanding is after the transfer request is initiated  you need to download the Paynow QR from Amaze and use banks apps to scan the Paynow QR to transfer money from your bank account to Amaze account.,btohqsg
can put back into OA through voluntary housing refund if you used your OA for buying property.,btohqsg

Below is my guess based on info provided.Likely OP Instarem account had been hacked  and hacker tried to bank transfer (send) to steal the money. However  in SG  need to use Instarem system generated Paynow QR code to transfer money from bank account to OP Instarem account. Since hacker can‚Äôt access OP bank account to complete the Paynow. The transaction did not completed n was cancelled subsequently after it was discovered.,btohqsg
anyone knows if Nail Palace (MCC 7230) will earn 4mpd for UOB PPV??,btohqsg
"There are multiple Nail Palace locations in Singapore  each with a different Merchant Category Code (MCC).

i checked on Amaze and it‚Äôs MCC 7230 but I‚Äôm not sure if it earns 4mpd,btohqsg
How are you paying? If it‚Äôs mobile contactless  you can get 4mpd. For PPV  if you paywave  and the mcc is not in blacklist  it will be eligible for bonus.,btohqsg
Yes then you will get 4mpd,btohqsg
I asked as heymax stated 0.4mpd ü§® but hey thanks ü§©,btohqsg

If alr hit FRS  is it wise to do voluntary top-up to OA due to accurred interest?,btohqsg
only if you are unable to beat 2.5% p.a. consistently with your cash,btohqsg
After 55 and hitting FRS and MA BHS  is it all CPF contributions will go to OA?,btohqsg
FRSSARABHS MAOA go OASA go SAMA go OARA see below:Upon the closure of the Special Account (SA) for CPF members aged 55 and above in early 2025  the CPF contributions allocated to SA will be fully allocated to the member‚Äôs Retirement Account (RA)  up to the Full Retirement Sum (FRS). For members who have set aside the FRS in the RA  these contributions will be channelled to the Ordinary Account.,btohqsg
Oh sorry I meant RA hit FRS at 55  do CPF contributions still go to RA or all to OA,btohqsg
hi sorry if this has been raised before  if i've hit FRS and BHS but not yet 55  can I withdraw SA for investment to allow for RSTU / VCMA for tax relief purposes?,btohqsg
Yes you can withdraw from SA (even without hitting FRS) but no you cannot top up your SA RSTU anymore.For MA  once you hit BHS  you cannot top up unless you use your MA to pay premium or some medical bills.,btohqsg
Investment capital using SA is part of FRS calculation for SA. Only way to VCMA is when BHS increased or MA consumed.SA investments are highly limited and are unlikely to beat SA interests after fees. Do your own research before doing any investments. Not financial advice.,btohqsg
Hi guys. If I'm booking for an overseas hotel via direct website in foreign currency (around 5kSGD) what is the recommended card for miles.  Thanks,btohqsg
Maybank horizon or maybank vi i think with no cap,btohqsg
I would use Citi Prestige + Amaze to knock some of the fx fees off and get some miles.Both ideas are valid. Just how much you‚Äôre willing to spend for miles.,btohqsg
i think this not very efficient.. no offence.the better way if you already have citi prestige is to utilise the FX spend promo 4.5mpd nowElse Queenie's idea of Maybank World Master 3.2mpd uncapped is very good (since exceeded $4k),btohqsg
Why?Citi Prestige + Amaze = net loss in my opinionPrestige local = 1.3 mpd x 1.5 cents = 1.95% benefitAmaze FX Cost = 1.8% (some say 2%) + mastercard 0.8% = 2.6-2.8% costTotal = 2.6 - 1.95 = NET COST 0.65% for every foreign dollar you spend,btohqsg
For the $88 dbs promo if i tag my dbs card to shopback and use shopback to pay at restuarant will it be considered as part of the quota ?,btohqsg
For Citi Prestige + Amaze combo  just switch to Youtrip. ü§£Miles are worth max 1cent per mile.,btohqsg
Building on this discussion  if spend is in THB and is below 4k  would UOB PRVI Miles be the best choice?,btohqsg
should be Maybank Horizon Visa Signature for now as they have promo 3.2mpd,btohqsg
If I have trust card  does it make sense to use that instead because good FX rate and 1% unlimited cashback,btohqsg
Trust card for the 1% non bonus category... it is only a slight positive gain1% cashback - Visa Spread of 0.8% = 0.2% net gainSo far i have only been using Trust cashback for my Bonus 15% Dining category overseas.,btohqsg
as comparison  maybank horizon visa signature (promo now)3.2 miles x 1.5 cents valuation - 4% FX cost = 0.8% net positive gain,btohqsg
Thanks guys will take a look at Maybank horizon visa,btohqsg
https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/promotions/cards/cardspecific/8x-travel.pageuntil 31 jan onlythereafter 2.8 mpd (2.8 x 1.5 - 4% = 0.2%) equal to trust net 0.2% benefit,btohqsg

Guys  any recommendations for home insurance i.e. good coverage with good price,btohqsg
I just signed up for TIQ home insurance  do compare- TIQ by Etiqa Code R56612https://hmsg.link/tiqhttps://t.me/sgpromocode/23,btohqsg
Hi  can check if my understanding of foreign currency transaction fee 3.25% is correct.Using this as reference  if the exchange rate is the same  and if I use UOB VS to pay instead  I would have to pay $36.18 + 3.25% = $37.36 but would have earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
U should use visa rate not mastercard then plus 3.25 fee. Amaze fee not 3.25 and it use mastercard rate,btohqsg
This is for Master card. You should use Visa.https://www.visa.com.sg/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.html,btohqsg
Just wanted to make sure my understanding is correct so next time I can calculate for future transactions.For ease of calculation  Assume that the exchange rate for visa and master is the same at 1sgd = 3.2228myr I would pay $36.18 + 3.25% = $37.36So I pay extra $1.18 but would have earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi  if I were to make payment using uob ppv via Kris+ app do I still earn 4 mpd ? Mcc is 4722 travel,btohqsg
4722 is not a bonus earning MCC under PPV's online whitelist.,btohqsg

Probably tightening the screw  due to more ppl defaulting in their CC bill payment ?,btohqsg

Id say just update salary record with uob and apply. Can get is good.,btohqsg
Sorry but I‚Äôm curious is UOB solitaire better than UOB krisflyer card?,btohqsg
To me yes   but depends on your lifestyle.UOB KF value dropped after it cannot be linked with amaze for rewards,btohqsg
they should just rename it UOB Kris+ card,btohqsg
Oic. I‚Äôm not family with amaze. I just have KF to clock miles. For the past year  fairly decent ~100k,btohqsg
i got rejected i think at 90-100k,btohqsg
force me to go update income then apply,btohqsg
If u are using Amaze linked with credit card here  I have gotten 2.1% FX with MYR in recent months  comparing with Mastercard rates. 3.25% should be above the Master/Visa rates.,btohqsg

Last day to redeem krisflyer miles at 4mpd rate for hsbc revol,btohqsg
done that. i think i barely earn 25k krisflyer miles every year = 75k before telling to spend ü´†ü´†ü´†  i dont think can redeem any business class sitting without topping up heavily huhuhu,btohqsg
Biz class to BKK is only 16800 miles under spontaneous escape üòè,btohqsg
for a 3hr flight  i pass,btohqsg
spend towards a nice hotel in bkk is a better choice haha,btohqsg
How do you redeem your kf miles to get bangkok hotel?,btohqsg
shangri la hotel bkk üëÄ  i think can exchange between krisflyer and shangri la hotel points,btohqsg
but then again my points are low to the point of just redeem for cash better ü´†,btohqsg
Redeem for cash is like 2.5% rebate only for the case of hsbc revo,btohqsg
You have hsbc miles. You can redeem it directly to mariott btw. Not that i recommend that but better than convert to KF then KF to mariott,btohqsg
true  but then my intiial plan is to upgrade to biz so since after x years  if not redeemed then bobian become mariott,btohqsg
75k KF is a good business flight (one way or even return) to a few places. Again  if you cannot hit your redemption target before expiry of your miles  its time to review if miles game is for you.,btohqsg
well because of ocbc 365 and my ocbc 360 acct so i more towards getting the bang for the buck. whether i can get the miles is dependent on my spending at that time. So just treat it as soemthing can acheive and if not look for some alternatives like spending on krisshop or something,btohqsg
You mentioned you want bang for your buck so I wanted to highlight there could be better way to do it  like cashback. Anyway  you do you. Happy can already. No need to min max everything.,btohqsg
now with singpass so convenient. last time still need payslip and cpf,btohqsg
oof haha. ya i see how to go around it. its not the best/optimal way for mile chasers but because i am stuck to one bank and paycheck there so its not that easy to get miles unless i take the hassle into moving all to uob but also find theirs to be troublesome too zzz,btohqsg
if I got some money  should I top up to frs or pump it into mortgage? I want to retire early,btohqsg
if you want to retire then you shouldnt topup cpf where you only have access 55/65?,btohqsg

Hi what is the mcc of neighbourhood clinics? Are payment at private clinics excluded under uobone?,btohqsg
Did anyone receive this before? I also made voluntarily topup of 8k to my cpf for tax relief. Is this the reason i receive this email?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know the answer but I‚Äôm curious to follow what happens next. It‚Äôs saying refund goes to employer so you Lugi?It‚Äôs a bit related to my earlier discussions about 37 740 being the global cap (or not) if you have multiple employers.How many jobs do u hold?,btohqsg
I think isn't related to your 8k top-up to your SA or MA. Rather  the amount that your employer contributed to your CPF (across 3 accounts) was over the annual cap.So the excess amount has been refunded back to the employer  and the employer should pay the employee portion to your bank account directly.,btohqsg
Use cash or cpf to invest?,btohqsg
I think cannot pay off mortgage all at once,btohqsg
So my 8k topup MA for tax relief doesnt constitute under the annual limit of 37740?,btohqsg
Does not. You have a happy problem. Your salary is very high.,btohqsg
Hi  any thoughts/recommended actions on this situation?I had a $1000 transaction with HSBC Revo on 29Nov2024 but was posted only on the 3dec2024  hence the bonus pts will only be credited on 31jan2025. However  the devaluation of the conversion of HSBC points to miles was announced on 16thDec2024 and is effective on 16Jan.,btohqsg
Yup your 8k top up not related to the email you got.,btohqsg
Not sure.first time i encouter this. But good to know this is not related to 8k contribution for tax relief.,btohqsg
More likely is your employer contributed more than $17 340 (17% of $102K annual limit)  and you annual pay exceeding $102K for 2024,btohqsg
