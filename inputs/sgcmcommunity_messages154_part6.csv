Hi anyone have recommendations for CAT A car for family use  around $12-14k/yr depre?,btohqsg
I'm looking to get my first car...,btohqsg
Does changing the headunit (infotainment) void warranty?,btohqsg
I recall bmw PML dont allow,btohqsg
Ur golf want put oso ?,btohqsg
I thinking getting used elantra  but the better depre one no headunit only have the radio. Not sure how much to budget if want to install the headunit + reverse camera,btohqsg
Just remember  you get for what you pay for,btohqsg
I think you just get the new Avante. A lot of 2nd hand,btohqsg
No head unit better. U can buy the biggest one with 360 cam  tpms etc,btohqsg
Basic android head unit and camera about 500-600 can do,btohqsg
But you might not get proper fitting brackets etc.,btohqsg
So  if your car headunit only controls music  calls  maps,btohqsg
And you change without stripping or cutting any wires,btohqsg
I.e. connect directly to the connection couplers already installed,btohqsg
But if your headunit has more functions of the car like in the case of many Germans  service records  car settings  etc. Etc.,btohqsg
You will likely void warranty on your electrics,btohqsg
