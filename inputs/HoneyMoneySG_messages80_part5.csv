Like if I buy electronics and the store offers those 0% installment. Will I only get rewards for my 1st month when I pay? Or subsequent months I'm also eligible for the rewards,btohqsg
the stores only have 0% installment for some bank cards. If they have buy-now-pay-later like Atome then can use Amaze+CRMC,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know if using bank card for mrt trip  it can recognize that its senior citizen fare instead of adult fare?,btohqsg
Nope. Only concession card for concession fares.,btohqsg
Hi anyone know when the 40 000 thank you points from Citibank credit card promotion will be credited into account?,btohqsg
So meaning no way for seniors to use bank card for their mrt trips?,btohqsg
Yup. Can upgrade existing concession card to simplygo concession card and do auto top-up. Can get ezlink points for rewards.Top-ups DO NOT count for spending for most credit cards. Check your cards tnc.,btohqsg
Honestly kind of worth for Seniors to use concession card because they get at least 30% discount.Keyword is at least  because really long distance rides can get them around 60% discount.Just set the card up for auto top-up and you can redeem rewards on ezlink app also.,btohqsg
I thought if itâ€™s possible to double dip with concession and miles card. But since it doesnâ€™t recognize then no choice,btohqsg
You might find luck with UOB absolute cashback card for 1.7% cashback with 25 cents fee per auto top-up.,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone has the excel sheet template for calculating daily average balance for UOB one account interest and is willing to share? Thanks alot,btohqsg
Hi  i wanted to apply Tbill using CPF OA and my CPFIS accout is with UOB.. but i wasn't able to select the CPF option online.. does anyone encounter the same issue? no problem for cash and srs,btohqsg

Hi  any advice for applying HSBC revolution credit card from singsaver  money smart or hsbc websites to get the best cash offers and benefits e.g luggage bag? ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
I would say just be very patient ðŸ˜‚ I applied for mine in early August 2023 and until now they still say my application is processing. I already gave up on getting any sign-up gift cause by the time they approve I'm sure the promotion period will be over ady,btohqsg
ðŸ˜³ Which one did u apply for the card? Singsaver  money smart or via hsbc website?,btohqsg
SingSaver  but the bank itself is quite slow one. My brother's one took like 8 weeks to approve also I think. So be careful of the promotion period eg. if it ends 31 December 2023 then it's a bit scary,btohqsg
In that case  perhaps apply via hsbc website seem a better choice ðŸ˜†https://www.hsbc.com.sg/credit-cards/products/revolution/#welcomegift,btohqsg
Curious about amaze card linked with Citi rewards. Would we still receive rewards points for installment payments? (The amount will be locked in today  deducted over 12cycles),btohqsg
does anyone knows $48k citi miles = $ value?,btohqsg
I apply  approve within 1 week,btohqsg
1.2 Citi Miles# per S$1 local spend i.e. $40k,btohqsg
Hi all  for singsavers promotion  if the promo ends on 22 nov  i signed up the credit card on 20th   does that mean that if i reach the minimum spend after the the 22nd  i wont be eligible or is it 1 month from application (ie till 20th dec),btohqsg
as in convert citi miles to cashback? or u asking $ value of 48k miles with partner airline,btohqsg
Yes. The discounted fares only applies to concession cards that have the name  face  NRIC etcâ€¦ like students and seniors. Anything else is normal adult fare.I think maybe because these concession cards got some encoded data to tell the machine that you student  senior etc. Bank cards and normal anonymous ezlink cards cannot encode data so normal fares ah.,btohqsg
I also interested to knowâ€¦ alot of credit cards donâ€™t give rewards for instalment payment so curious too. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
What does the promo tnc say,btohqsg
Hi all  i am holding citi cashback visa. Is the cashback same as citi cashback mastercard?,btohqsg
Hi if I use citipayall with my Citi rewards card  do I get 4mpd but itâ€™s capped at 1k? Which card to use to beat convert to miles for insurance and income tax payment,btohqsg
Citipayall promo is 1.8 mpd  independent of the card mpd rate.4mpd is for online spending  exclusive of citipayall.,btohqsg
So I donâ€™t need to apply new credit card. That means my Citi rewards no cap at 1k also? Doesnâ€™t matter which card I use?,btohqsg
If you want to use Citipayall  can use citirewards  max cap spending of $120k  minimum of 8k.but the intial points obtained will be lower than other cards to my knowledge  the bonus will come in later for you to hit 1.8mpdYou get 0.4mpd first  then when the promotion ends you get the remaining 1.4mpd,btohqsg
Oh why lower than other cards? I thought you mentioned itâ€™s independent of the card?,btohqsg
The 1.8mpd is independent of any cards used.But the base + bonus is different for each card.E.g. premiermiles earns 1.2mpd usually  citi rewards is at 0.4 mpd.the promotion will top up the remaining miles at the end of promotion period.,btohqsg
Ooh but the net is the same but just differing time it is credited in?,btohqsg
yes  eventually it's the same  but make sure u hit minimum 8k spending,btohqsg
For OCBC 360  if i withdraw my pay every month it comes in  is there an ideal timing i should do it? eg anytime before 4pm? I have been setting up recurring transfer which should be ok right? thx!,btohqsg
Total right? Do t have to be one transaction,btohqsg
Hi experts  does Citi bank ask previous career experience for credit card application ?,btohqsg
no. why would they ask that?,btohqsg
Is there an alert for new new credit card promotions on moneysmart or singsaver?,btohqsg
Iâ€™m also curious about that. The staff ask my email address  phone number and my pass 10 years working experience,btohqsg
I'm more curious why is there a staff involved for a cc application lol,btohqsg
Weird lol. Unless you not working rn and applying for cc.. which I know usually will just reject,btohqsg
You can always delete the message. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
how u applied for the card?,btohqsg
Hi question about Dbs points to be converted into miles. By When should I redeem / convert them? It will be expired after one year   right?,btohqsg

Isnâ€™t the exact same as what I shared in the picture above ?,btohqsg
