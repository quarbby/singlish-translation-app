but need know which one to use,btohqsg
Lemme tell you this story of mine.. not long ago I collected my A-level results  17 February this year.. Still can remember the date,btohqsg
My ESE exams where on the 20th week  all 6 papers,btohqsg
I didn't study at all cuz the results kept me awake during all my lessons. I remember vaguely that my ESE for Organic Chem held 60% of my entire grade and I didn't spend a single day's studying for it,btohqsg
my pocoyo self has absolutely dieded,btohqsg
melody now dominates the world !,btohqsg
My bro stole my laptop again till 9-10,btohqsg
In the end I just yoloed my test and got a C average for my ESE... I just barely met my CA criteria also as I missed 6 lessons out of 13 for Organic Chem,btohqsg
Dang now I know why you said a diploma is a given in rp,btohqsg
Exactly Passing in RP is easy just attend at least half the lessons and do the ESE or MSA,btohqsg
I mean getting a diploma is given but what is not is “when”,btohqsg
I mean she killed mr jelly,btohqsg
Remod u gotta be a special idiot to do so also.. most don't even hit the 7 lessons attended criteria,btohqsg
I have friends with higher gpa remodding modules I passed at,btohqsg
still doing slides at this hr,btohqsg
Once you are below 3 it doesn't even fucking matter what GPA it is,btohqsg
Yall will get used to it. I did my organic chem exam was at 9am on Tuesday that week and I left school at 7pm on Monday as I had to discuss things with my programme chair,btohqsg
So if everything else fails just YOLO,btohqsg
I asked my lecturer that same question and got the same response even better he was the module chair,btohqsg
Eh but frz tho why ah,btohqsg
Legit I understand its your first major poly exam but legit its not a big deal,btohqsg
then strap on a condom and unfuck yourself,btohqsg
Welcome to STEM everyone is fucked,btohqsg
Yes improvise adapt overcome.. for me I just ask them to go harder cuz I am insane,btohqsg
i mean even if you get destroyed,btohqsg
just brush yourself off and carry on to the next,btohqsg
Just do well ursef can le,btohqsg
Only got if everyone scored like trash,btohqsg
Ok how do I say this arh even if they say don't have there's an implied bellcurve,btohqsg
I feel ee shag in general tbh,btohqsg
Cuz most modules have informal caps for A,btohqsg
The rumor in RP is its 8 per class of 25,btohqsg
I got ptsd from poly but when i entered uni  it was a whole new level. So enjoy poly while u can🤣,btohqsg
I coped with it by accepting my fate.. u can follow me or trying to slog your guts out to maintain a cGPA of >3,btohqsg
STEM more strict with the A cap,btohqsg
NTU is the same too lol both use moderation and admit to it,btohqsg
NUS is just more grinders as well its NUS,btohqsg
then A+ and A is how much,btohqsg
i alw thought A and A+ was 25%,btohqsg
ngl sg is q bad imo,btohqsg
A+ is usually the commendation one which is top 5% that kind,btohqsg
3% is 30 ppl for cs,btohqsg
