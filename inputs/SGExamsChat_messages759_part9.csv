same actually  like i want to see my grades,btohqsg
i just wanna see my math tbh,btohqsg
how did i get an E,btohqsg
As someone who helped mark sch exam scripts before  it's a pain to read illegible handwriting.The only reason why school teachers endure it is because don't want students to come in droves to ask for marks,btohqsg
i like how we just wanna see the fucked up ones,btohqsg
but Cambridge don't have such problems,btohqsg
Tot it was 2 markers in 1 room if cannot they flag a chief marker if all 3 say cannot then that word is disregarded,btohqsg
So u gotta be so bad 3 random teachers cannot read it at all,btohqsg
1 of my cher said cambridge want keep it hidden becus scared of legal stuff lol,btohqsg
i'm at the point i get annoyed at my own writing if it's ugly,btohqsg
unless i'm just trudging through calculations,btohqsg
at least u got into NTU,btohqsg
i want to see my econs,btohqsg
oh yea i will keep rewriting if it is ugly,btohqsg
you honestly think the 2 markers who are colleagues rather go through more pain for a stranger who will never get back the paper to see?,btohqsg
this is if iâ€™m scribbling out to check so idc the handwriting,btohqsg
i wonder what like stuff they gotta do differently on a day to day basis,btohqsg
By right I think that's what they suppose to do la.. by left they can just take a dartboard and do the scores that way and no one would know,btohqsg
In Humanities for Uni we fix that problem once and for all,btohqsg
imagine in their shoes and you have another 100 scripts waiting,btohqsg
in uni even for tests bc they just give as much paper as i want  i just write v big,btohqsg
It's called typing out your essay in Times New Roman,btohqsg
aye can cambridge markers work in normal schools afterwards?,btohqsg
untidy is ok  bordering on illegible not ok,btohqsg
"Teacher write this if you did not complete paper ""Cambridge does not award marks based on tidyness""",btohqsg
but combi sci practical are marked by local markers starting last year,btohqsg
Some are quite dedicated also I am pretty sure these days they would use algorithms to transcribe the words through scanner liao,btohqsg
That's what we do for logistics of mailing,btohqsg
how they even vet these markers anyways,btohqsg
they are school teachers who are trained.,btohqsg
do they have to live on a campus or smth oso,btohqsg
Just fix the issue using scanners and they transcribed it for us automatically then if cmi it goes into the bin for review,btohqsg
wldnt schs with these teachers have an advantage then?,btohqsg
That's pinning the hope on hitting a dedicated onevs just making it more legible,btohqsg
illegible handwriting is just not giving the examiners the respect they need,btohqsg
My point is that I legit think they just scan it and the system autotranscribes,btohqsg
should be teachers from many different schools. So still ok,btohqsg
The only exception is for the practical papers cuz legit the reason is the chemicals on the paper does not allow for it to be scanned,btohqsg
there was a documentary on it but for Oxford version of O lvlthey didn't transcribe it,btohqsg
for 99% of scripts  generally legible,btohqsg
i tot my cher mentioned before papers are now scanned instead of physically transported,btohqsg
cus of cases of papers lost during transit before,btohqsg
Or just use my momâ€™s ipad that she barely uses,btohqsg
recreation just use your mum's ipadif starting uni studies and using it for studying  recommend getting a new one,btohqsg
Should be ig? I write like shit also they can read one so tbh I think one needs to just past the reasonable person standard,btohqsg
As in u take your handwriting u go out and ask ppl if they can read it at random if cannot means u fucked up,btohqsg
I dunno if transcribing is a thing coz my cher was worried for me that cambridge cant read my ant-like handwritingðŸ’€ðŸ’€ so she suggested i use ballpoint (which actually helped to get the words bigger),btohqsg
Yep after the papers lost in train incident  but scanning wun make the legibility any better (if not maybe even worst lol),btohqsg
doubt u wrote that badly.There are really bad ones. However  based on my understanding  most of these students just don't bother about grades.My handwriting isn't good too tbh. Just need to be legible,btohqsg
I do know that scanning is a thing tho something like on screen reading as SEAB says it,btohqsg
