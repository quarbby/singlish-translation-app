Chat  where would u guys reco for someone who nvr ate hotpot outside before,btohqsg
my time is just x number of sh classes in one house,btohqsg
then just try to balance numbers,btohqsg
there’s like multiple ori for uni so,btohqsg
hmm that makes me even more scared HAHAHA,btohqsg
I prefer just pop up outta nowwhwrre and start school straight xD,btohqsg
lol at least you get to skip ori,btohqsg
cuz I scared if I skip I dk anyone HAHAHA uni a bit diff I thought,btohqsg
idk if ite can skip anot,btohqsg
usually I think ori all can skip one,btohqsg
depending on where u want to or not......,btohqsg
I originally wanted to go Sec 5 then my school say cannot,btohqsg
Ya apparently sg don't like to retain students  my jc1 promos was 2U 3E and they still promoted me :/,btohqsg
I say I wan retain they can cannot,btohqsg
end up I went jc2 with like zero knowledge,btohqsg
i think for uni it’s best to make some friends at least from your faculty,btohqsg
Ight I guess I'll try go for it.....,btohqsg
like uni has its own system. no one gonna tell you exactly what to do so it’s nice to have ppl to bounce off,btohqsg
like if there’s one ori to go i’d say it’s faculty one,btohqsg
com engineer and environmental engineer  both nvr got in lol,btohqsg
i didn't know my year business cut off so low,btohqsg
Aite homie imma go thr someday,btohqsg
hmm i don't think I'm going overseas sadly.... XD,btohqsg
yeah  and also do u prefer one person one pot or one pot for multiple people,btohqsg
Uhhh I thought hot pot normally for more than 1 ppl?,btohqsg
tbh ill reapply if doesn't work then I'll stick to it,btohqsg
you can try to appeal for ur courses if that works in uni,btohqsg
I mean... can be many people but yall each person got individual pot one,btohqsg
i still have no idea whether i wanna go local or overseas uni  anyways i still have like 4-5 years to decide,btohqsg
Ohh I nvr tried cause I was under that impression initially HAHA,btohqsg
Hopefully u get into somewhere of your choice xD,btohqsg
the course I wanna go to is quite competitive i suppose  either going into aerospace or physics,btohqsg
and I'm only on duty tmr,btohqsg
technically mechanical also related to aerospace,btohqsg
true  but if i were to go on more hands on work then I’ll go for aerospace,btohqsg
i mean you gotta think about what you see yourself doing,btohqsg
aerospace is also quite saturated jobs wise but yea you’ve got time to think,btohqsg
i mean my decisions might change in the future so i also have to be prepared for that,btohqsg
i think either way it won’t matter much,btohqsg
my take is do what you want,btohqsg
A levels > PSLE > O levels (difficulty imo),btohqsg
means the 12 yo should alr take o levels based on this,btohqsg
PSLE was so difficult that I didn’t even do Os lol,btohqsg
even 12 y/o can score better for o levels than psle LOL,btohqsg
The self-actualisation has to kick in first,btohqsg
YA IKR BRUH O LEVEL SO EASY,btohqsg
My platoon even have a sfi allergic group,btohqsg
if n levels bell curve can save you then o levels bell curve can also,btohqsg
Sometimes I wonder what's the genz rice purity,btohqsg
rice purity is like higher the more pure?,btohqsg
