this car owner drove a merc GLB180 to MBS and parked. when he returned  he opened the boot and due to the height of the boot  the wall or the ceiling caused a scratch. he went to confront to the mall management and they replied it was built according to the requirements and it's all within the mandatory requirement set by the government,btohqsg
owner felt this is unfair and insist that the mall should be responsible,btohqsg
lol mbs should sue him for damages instead,btohqsg
how self entitled people can get,btohqsg
if the mall really takes in all the responsiblity  i can go there and scratch whatever i want,btohqsg
and then get a new fresh coat of paint complimentary by mbs,btohqsg
Must open carefully in mall carparks,btohqsg
Because the tailgate goes higher than the car height if you don't stop it,btohqsg
Set your tailgate height to something lower,btohqsg
And then manually push up a bit for every mall,btohqsg
Seriously he should blamed on himself to park too near it or open the boot so high before looking it 1st...,btohqsg
Why build the car like this,btohqsg
does he even knows that there is a height limitation on that boot?,btohqsg
But thanks for this article… going to park at mbs this Friday,btohqsg
Don’t worry… I will not complain to mbs  I will complain to mazda,btohqsg
He should confront the fire sprinkler🤭🤭🤭,btohqsg
Or his own misjudgement which he chose to blame others instead,btohqsg
common sense aint so common nowadays,btohqsg
if u notice the ceiling is low  shouldnt u hold the boot as it opens just in case,btohqsg
maybe he expecting the ceiling to be like mbs mall,btohqsg
