Yeah international a levels standard is like at least 1 grade lower than Singapore. So a person who gets B for a subject here is likely as good as a student who gets an A in the UK,btohqsg
With this standard a lot of ppl here can go Oxbridge,btohqsg
Like AAB or ABB can alr,btohqsg
i was ‚ùì when the person says nobody applies to nus without perfect transcript and 1600 because that's cap if you count sgeansüò≠ prob true for foreigners though,btohqsg
Well if that‚Äôs true then the preferential treatment towards Singaporean‚Äôs was more than I originally thought. It‚Äôs not rly a surprise why a lot of Chinese tourists have been visiting our local unis recently,btohqsg
i mean not to be mean but sg is a small country and the education system is already notoriously competitive so it makes perfect sense for our local uni to prioritise local students  esp the A level kids,btohqsg
cause poly kids can start working after they get their diploma but an sg a level cert is meant as a university entrance cert,btohqsg
Yeah it makes sense to prioritise just like what the UK is doing for their local unis  it‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs hard to tell when is there too much preferential treatment and when is there not enough,btohqsg
Like even right now as kuro pointed out some Singaporeans still complaining despite the obvious preferential treatment towards Singaporeans,btohqsg
Like the high admissions requirements for international students may have made the uni seem more prestigious to them than it is to us,btohqsg
Like we don‚Äôt rly think of entering most nus/ntu courses as something extremely big,btohqsg
they have a quota for locals,btohqsg
their rationale is pushing more locals to get a degree and contribute at a higher level to the sg economy,btohqsg
i mean that's an issue with the curve system as a whole,btohqsg
wasted my whole holiday slacking bruh,btohqsg
wat wld be a better system tho,btohqsg
not saying any system is objectively better or worse,btohqsg
it's just if you go to a uni that uses a curve,btohqsg
this is smth you deal with,btohqsg
idk lol i think my course had an equal amount of people pulling up curve,btohqsg
ok my course had almost 0 non paper tests,btohqsg
If there weren‚Äôt any preferential treatment towards Singaporeans (like no quota) and we are held up to the same standard as international students  I‚Äôm not sure if even half the students in nus would be Singaporeans,btohqsg
Quick qn do yall have a fixed bbt order or do you guys order different drink every time ?,btohqsg
my friend calls sajc a low tier jc as well dude,btohqsg
call him a low tier human,btohqsg

and then says ri hci top tier,btohqsg
is he a bottom cause bro seems to be obsessed with tops,btohqsg
if he thinks sajc is bad then what about mi bro,btohqsg
The only jc we can all agree on is low tier is yi lol,btohqsg
Ohya time to stir shitBbt 0% sugar,btohqsg
I feel like cj is like arts stream mid but sci stream is low,btohqsg
Ask moe. It‚Äôs not considered one,btohqsg
TM arts stream is üíÄ from what I hear,btohqsg
Huh MI students do what. Just that it‚Äôs a 3 year course,btohqsg
I mean it's same same but diff,btohqsg
Moe do make a distinction of mi,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs like cj arts better but sci bad  tm sci better but arts bad,btohqsg
then why arent they called a jc,btohqsg
Me praying none of my batch mates r here idw to get cancelled xd,btohqsg
Ask moe. I really don‚Äôt know,btohqsg
I grade myself an A grade for floofiness üòé,btohqsg
Eh wait idk the proportion of like sci to arts in other jcs but,btohqsg
Moe just calls MI a ‚Äúcentralised institute‚Äù lol,btohqsg
There used to be others but now js MI,btohqsg
Yeah they merged 2 institutes to form MI,btohqsg
why does mi have commerce stream tho,btohqsg
