But for conti u better take,btohqsg
If u drive japanese car u will do fine without it if u have ur own workshop,btohqsg
so next time if i buy a console use atome?,btohqsg
Generally less reliable and have more issues,btohqsg
Mercs is the least bad for reliability wise,btohqsg
yet people say to avoid atome (bnpl),btohqsg
bcs if ur not careful it could rise up,btohqsg
Bmw because like to leak oil ah?,btohqsg

I rather u just pay full cash,btohqsg

How‚Äôs your daughter  or is that shane,btohqsg
Tanks .. I too tall liao üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
i gonna bring her to her favourite nasi padang shop,btohqsg
We were just talking about it,btohqsg
Always give me good crispy bergedil,btohqsg
Proceed claim your insurance  the insurance should chase his insurance then he Jialut,btohqsg
Gotta be careful cos you may end up using your own insurance to pay for the repairs. If he refuse to report to his insurance company  you may have to bring him to court,btohqsg
gee wonder what GIA is doing when ppl is providing video evidence..,btohqsg
Make the report but don‚Äôt send for repair until both insurance settles,btohqsg
"In the event of one party choosing to make claims  insurance companies then do the necessary investigations to establish liability when deciding whether to penalise the insured motorist.""In cases of late or no reports  the insured motorist scores an own goal "" Mr Ho said. ""The practical option is for claimants to make a claim against their own comprehensive motor insurance policies. They benefit from having their vehicle repaired quickly and leave it to their insurer to take on the effort of resolving the liability with the other party.""If the claimant's insurer considers that its insured driver is not at fault in the accident  his annual premium should not be affected just because he reported an accident.""",btohqsg
Actually not lol its likely a misunderstanding  going by what you said later.,btohqsg
Is he paying for the repairs if you repair at his ws?,btohqsg
Yes  the most important part is you make a report with your own insurance company within 24hrs,btohqsg
If he is paying for the repairs provided it's done at his ws  then he is actually going for pte settlement and you have to make sure he is paying  by confirming with his ws. Just that he might be guarding against you jacking up the costs if you repair at your own ws  and he trusts his own. To him  by refusing to repair at his ws  you are the one refusing pte settlement.,btohqsg
Claim for accident is not just repair cost,btohqsg
When i get hit before  my ws suggested me $100 per day of downtime add on to repair cost  accounted in invoice,btohqsg
I see  if he's willing to compensate for loss of use then actually can consider but if he's not willing to  then claim insurance le,btohqsg
Just claim him can Liao settle . Dun need to bother about other things,btohqsg
just claim insurance is the safest  üôè,btohqsg
You got go hospital do check up,btohqsg
See got suffer internal damage like neck pain   etc or triggering psychological issues,btohqsg
Then after that go holiday hor,btohqsg
Thought servicing costs should be lower compared to an ev,btohqsg
I remember the road tax so high is because ev doesn't use petrol so no petrol tax incurred,btohqsg
This road tax formula is so silly  totally removed the benefits of using an ev,btohqsg
Fuel should be much lesser too,btohqsg
i never use ev before haha thinking of buying a dolphin in jb,btohqsg
i bot my yaris G only rm 85k waiting for the new car to be delivered,btohqsg
Sir I think you forgot to change account,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇ i wonder how cross hump,btohqsg

Lol left right left right lo,btohqsg
I think you left right left right also not enough  unless it's a cheat code,btohqsg
Change body kit every 6 months üëç,btohqsg
Is it part of those syndicate that bring you to their workshop and charge you high high so they can earn from it,btohqsg
Is there any difference between insurance providers or all same same one?,btohqsg
Which one more powerful? I wanna know if my provider CMI or not,btohqsg
taxi insurance is decided by the company  not by the drivers leh,btohqsg
He dono one la.. that‚Äôs y nvr jio pple,btohqsg
Once u call them during accident  they send their ginna down to help u,btohqsg
U sit railing drink water. The ginna help u settle everything,btohqsg
Some insurance  i dont want to direct name or place a red dot against the name  u call them  cannot reach them.,btohqsg
Power . Mine ntuc for now ü§™,btohqsg
They help u fill up the report also,btohqsg
Premium is cfm every year go up,btohqsg
Got claim no claim  got ncd no ncd,btohqsg
they wanted to match my insurance w coe ending,btohqsg
Decrease 1 month then my premium up 200-300,btohqsg
Its just first 2 yrs i not registered owner,btohqsg
Then my f20 i sell before year is up so no Ncd Lo,btohqsg
So that means can come MU ?,btohqsg

üòÖ will HOM come .. is the more impt question üòÇ,btohqsg
If i free i always come de hor,btohqsg
I always say Jio me if i free I will come,btohqsg
irritating that a lot of coe cars with 2-3 years left are around 13-14k depre  but those with 5 years left are 10-12k depre. rather not pay so much.,btohqsg
Got meh 10-12k are cars more than renewed 10 years coe,btohqsg
No leh  mine remains the same. But end up I still source for cheaper one.,btohqsg
The problem in this case is the quantum‚Ä¶those old cars are (obviously) just trying to play on the emotions of pple not wanting to pay so much absolute for the use of the car,btohqsg
Mine is buy 3 yrs get 2 yrs free . Provided I got no accident for the 3 yrs .,btohqsg
I think cause of demand also  many first time owners or those with tight budget will look at COE / parf car with low lease left,btohqsg
Since many people are considering those  dealers will just jack up the price knowing that people will still buy,btohqsg
Many people always complained no money   inflation   everything increase   but got money to buy property   go holidays   buy branded & atas place to show off at IG/fb   buy car.,btohqsg
i think my gen knows how to live life,btohqsg
in here for a good time not a long time bro,btohqsg
I want a long and juicy good time,btohqsg
My gen is the suffering & love to complain & not doing what should be done to change fate,btohqsg

Toyota engine  make alot of noise but barely move,btohqsg
Drove one before.. its damn bad,btohqsg
vios on the roads now driving like they have a V8 engine in them,btohqsg
"""The All-New Vios is equipped with a 1.5L powerplant  producing 107 bhp and along with it a 12 sec acceleration within 0-100km/h""https://www.oneshift.com/articles/news/the-allnew-toyota-vios-launched-in-singapore#:~:text=The%20All%2DNew%20Vios%20is%20equipped%20with%20a%201.5L more%20frugal%20within%20its%20class.",btohqsg
Considering the 118 is doing 10.8s... the vios is nt too shabby,btohqsg
Ya la  Toyota strength is never on its acceleration. They always market themselves as reliable only,btohqsg
I always think Toyota like a turtle  durable but slow and old,btohqsg
At least Vios nw more lookable,btohqsg
When it come to design and car feature they like damn slow to change,btohqsg
I feel like it is still playing catch up to other brand  especially when compared to Mazda or even honda,btohqsg
They will wait till other brand do first then slowly change it after a few years later,btohqsg
quota increase who bet coe up?,btohqsg
Increase means more ppl fight n buy,btohqsg
sometimes i wonder what is LTA real purpose of releasing more quota.. to earn more $$ or to really hope to bring it down,btohqsg
if they really sincere about it  PHV allocation would be similar to taxis and not bidded,btohqsg
Maybe cause no minister in charge  that is why no drastic changes?,btohqsg
Think covid held back a lot of things,btohqsg
They suppose to kill off COE cars for PHV and make it yearly inspections,btohqsg
Now they killing off all diesels n petrol taxis first,btohqsg
im quite worried if they kill of diesels,btohqsg
ltr no spare parts for SAF vehicles..,btohqsg
Army should be exempted from the carbon thing,btohqsg
in army got 1 time the saf veh emit black smoke,btohqsg
But must add a condition that it cannot resell into 2nd hand car market cos their coe not bidded,btohqsg
actually PHV cars shudnt sell back into resale market,btohqsg
now got alot cars idk odo fake anot  cus they quite common PHV models,btohqsg
I think 140k for cat A,btohqsg
Don't trust odo  can easily amended one,btohqsg
i know some cars u can check odo thru gearbox as well,btohqsg
so if ur gb and odo tak match,btohqsg
Why sg carmart don't want do pre purchase inspection for us,btohqsg
Buy new car then no need to go through all these,btohqsg
Then they release at a time when cars expo coming  those dealers just bid to secure some for the fair,btohqsg
Diesel will remain for SAF n Commercial,btohqsg
Can keep Coe for how long?,btohqsg
Next yr another 1% gst increase,btohqsg
Not even 3.30 I see the pre-bids start to come in already,btohqsg
What is the interest now for car loan?,btohqsg
I wanna see if cat B and open cat will break again cause of Velfire release,btohqsg
Some banks go 2.98 while some still 2.78,btohqsg
May I know how much is the down payment for new cars? And how much the interest now roughly  and how to count the monthly repayment,btohqsg
Is the time of the monthü•≥ü•≥ü•≥,btohqsg
Up to you to decide. Got 0% downpayment de also; got 40/60 % or 30/70%,btohqsg
Just use the calculator that the manufacturer provide. The rates dependant on where you get it from and which financial institution they work with,btohqsg
Ok I go sg car mart to check,btohqsg
I think cat B will break again,btohqsg
Lol so early that amount already,btohqsg
I see still 1 on the telegram channek,btohqsg
Current COE PriceCAT A: $1 (710/785)CAT B:$135100(580/474)CAT C:$85001(160/114)CAT D: $1 (435/497)CAT E: $1 (126/140),btohqsg
Maybe today can hit historic 150k for cat B,btohqsg
Cat A got drop? Like same same,btohqsg
I guess there will not be 150k Coe this round,btohqsg
150k I will sell my car,btohqsg

They will say the 2nd bidding the coe will continue to raise . So just in time for people to place order,btohqsg
As long as govt allow dealers to bid and hold the COEs dump 6000 also no use,btohqsg

300 addition COE = $ 1 000 dropIf want to decrease Coe price by $10k need 3 000 additional Coe?,btohqsg
Lol wonder if lta look so stupid now,btohqsg
Dealers would just bid and hold cos they know buyers will wan to buy,btohqsg
They release more coe is nt to make it drop,btohqsg
Need $$ to fund all the new mrt,btohqsg
300 dun really make up a lot ba,btohqsg
With cat A at 104k  that is 31.2 million extra,btohqsg
Relax la   can take bus mrt or walk,btohqsg
150 only next bidding another 150,btohqsg
At that point of time  see if it is cheaper to extend 5 years  or get parf/Coe cars that last for 2-3 years,btohqsg
so I'm looking at parf/coe cars. prices are crazy though.,btohqsg
my current car was 16k in 2021  with 3 yrs remaining lol,btohqsg
looking at 2-3x as much now,btohqsg
??? i buy a car to save time not do a second job,btohqsg
But it‚Äôll be nice to have the car pay for itself,btohqsg
like that I rather not drive car and just grab to/from work lol,btohqsg
and I'd probably be working ridiculous hours to pay off the car,btohqsg
its not an issue of affordability  just me complaining about the relative cost.,btohqsg
also I'm foreigner dont think I can do phv legally,btohqsg
2 hours of lalamove can earn you $50,btohqsg

BlueSg for A-B  means u from ur house leave at somewhere else settle,btohqsg
Getgo for A-A means u bring back to same place,btohqsg
Depends on what type of drive u planning,btohqsg
Not about the vehicle more of the use case scenario,btohqsg
hmmm okay but i heard getgo fees if anything happens its uhh not good?,btohqsg
No insurance how to have car,btohqsg
Just tht ur excess damn high,btohqsg
Excess = the amount u pay after insurance deduction,btohqsg
