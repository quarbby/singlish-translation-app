Hi thanks. See my answer below üôèMeet min income1st time appliedNo have any kind of loanno have any missed paymentI only have OCBC 360 account and Never allowed any one else to useNo black list from other bank alsoNo idea about credit score,btohqsg
Not fresh but foreigners working here. Maybe my nationality plays a part,btohqsg
Nah  start with DBS or Citi. OCBC will likely reject if you don‚Äôt have credit history,btohqsg
I see. I will try it. Thanks üôè,btohqsg
Do you have any savings account with any banks. I suggest try apply cc with the bank you have savings on.,btohqsg
Yes. I have OCBC 360 accounts and try applying OCBC infinity credit card and got rejected. It is my first time credit card applying in Singapore,btohqsg
When did you start working in Singapore?I presume your salary above $45 000 per year but not $30 000. Right?,btohqsg
I had a salary increase of about 20% and I applied for a credit limit increase  but the bank reduced my limit by more than 50% instead.  My credit score is AA. Until today I also don't know why they reduced my limit. I always pay in full.,btohqsg
Five years plus. Yes salary above 45000,btohqsg
Did you max ur card every month?,btohqsg
OCBC 99% will reject GX rating (no credit history). Having savings account with them doesn‚Äôt help. I got my first OCBC CC only after getting Premier status ü§≠,btohqsg
Tbh I didn't know ocbc was that strict.,btohqsg
To be exact the bank reduced my limit exactly 56%,btohqsg
anyone got DP for GIRO deduction from EGA for stanchart CC ? Is it on the actual day ?,btohqsg
Oh  we are good now. Using Ocbc infinity,btohqsg

Ohhhh  thanks üôèüèª I saw the more info button for the Visa and tot that they allowed applications for it again,btohqsg
Hi  would like to ask if the Oct Promo for this Amex Platinum Card is worthwhile compared to last month‚Äôs promo and if the Annual Income requirement is still at 30k?,btohqsg
hi  would like to check if citi smrt card can be linked to apple pay and used for public transport or do i have to tap with the physical card. And is it a qualifying transaction if i use the card through shopback pay or fave pay,btohqsg
I made a booking on Agoda  and cancelled the booking. Agoda made a refund. But the refund is wrong. Whom should I contact? The bank or Agoda ? Has anyone experience this ?,btohqsg
May I know if this is charged by the bank ?,btohqsg
I will call in to try my luck for bank to waive it. But not keeping hopes high,btohqsg
Anyone's citi cc is due today but no giro deduction yesterday?,btohqsg
Nope. Very long liao. Just that yesterday's didn't deduct,btohqsg
Yes it can be linked to Apple Pay and yes  is a qualifying transaction,btohqsg
The bank probably have looked at your past (recent) applications and grant you a credit limit based on their risk matrix. Bank would never explain why we are granted such a high or low credit limit.If u really need higher credit limit  I suggest trigger the credit review process of the bank after 3 months.Personally  I ask for lower credit limit by stating what limit I want instead of letting the bank decide. The downside is I have to go through the credit review process if I need to revise up the limit,btohqsg
Thanks ! I called in to the bank. They will submit a request to waive it and get back to me by 7 working days. If bank is not willing to refund  I will call in to Agoda. But I won't keep hopes high üòÇ,btohqsg
How many companies you work for last 5 years?How long you have been working for your current company?,btohqsg
2 companiesCurrent company working 4 years plus,btohqsg
The difference between paid and refund could be due to exchange rate. Example: When u booked  USD/SGD was 1.33. When the refund was processed  USD/SGD was 1.31,btohqsg
Yes I thought so too. I usually like to book on Airbnb   had refunds with no problem ...first time booking with Agoda and had bad experience üòÇ,btohqsg
To be frank  if the hotel rates on a platform is based on foreign currency  we might get back more or less for refund. To mitigate  I would choose to Pay in Advance and ensure the rates displayed is not based on a foreign currency converted to SGD,btohqsg
"This is just a ""feature"" of booking Agoda with Mastercard. Their payment gateway for mc is in HK and you will get DCC both ways. Can't really avoid this tbh if you choose to use Agoda.",btohqsg
Can we use hsbc advance credit card to earn cash back for mcc 8062 (hospital bill or charges)?Heymax.aisays can  but not in the credit card terms condition,btohqsg
Now that you explain it it makes sense. I made a booking with Agoda a long time ago with a Visa card . Got a full refund. Going forward if I were to use a Mastercard  I will make sure not to cancel at all cost üòÇ,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing this helpful information! Just curious if u happen to know.. would DCC charge apply if a Visa  Amex  UnionPay or DCS card were to be used?,btohqsg
Agoda will unlikely entertain you. The fees are charged by the bank and to Agoda  they have refunded fully.,btohqsg
According to their FAQ  they will refund. I will wait for the reply from bank first before contacting Agoda. If both sides don't want to refund  then I take it as a lesson learned. Either book with a Visa card   or just simply avoid Agoda üòÇ,btohqsg
Not bad if they actually refunds it,btohqsg
visa also charges this fee. if you want to avoid it totally  use amex,btohqsg
thought agoda via visa no fee cos processed locally,btohqsg
Hi all gurus  I would like to ask something outside of cc. I heard that travel insurance only covers like 30 days before the start of the trip and I wonder is that the same across all the insurers please.,btohqsg
