At that age the air suspension tends to fail and that is a big job labour and parts wise,btohqsg
2017-18 5 series will do you well,btohqsg
Applies to KIA  Mit and the brands under C&C.,btohqsg
The g30 pre lci that is,btohqsg
any thoughts on F10? vs G30,btohqsg
But you'd have to find a clean unit that hasn't had any cheap tuning done to it,btohqsg
Much prefer the g30 if you look at the 2 litre engines as they're newer and a slightly better place to be in if you're going for comfort,btohqsg
However if you're looking at the 6 cyls  the 535 f10 is certainly cheaper than the 540 g30,btohqsg
ya would prefer the b48 vs the N20,btohqsg
But at the same time finding a clean 535 f10 is very hard,btohqsg
Similarly you can get a w213 mid FL (mbux and newer steering wheel) but now what they are selling now,btohqsg
You might have better luck finding a clean c&c serviced unit for one of those,btohqsg
And then you can choose to go independent or not,btohqsg
Thanks guys üôè lots of options to tink about. Will look at w213 used or the new A4. Btw saw the byd atto 3 today  looks very nice for 163k,btohqsg
I heard there are a few clean rides around but owners not selling leh,btohqsg
The owners are wise to keep them running  great cars,btohqsg
Soundz very exp for 163k. üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
All diesel cars sounds the same,btohqsg

the idea that now not rainy season is laughable,btohqsg
sure it might not rain as much but when it rains it pours. having good wipers for good visibility  still important,btohqsg
I hate it when it rains at night. The reflection making me hard to see,btohqsg
Last night I drove without on headlights and din realised it,btohqsg
No wonder so many drivers tried to signal me,btohqsg
I put rainXAlot of layer.It's good for water splash from buses beside or vehicles frlm opposite direction,btohqsg
