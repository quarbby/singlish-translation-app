If already has 100k in the account  is it still worth?,btohqsg
as in already have $100k on 30 Jun?,btohqsg
then better put somewhere else with higher effective interest,btohqsg
Then don't put in UOB One  create new UOB stash account and register for the National Savings Promotion and put in 100k for 4 months  you get additional 1.674%  so total for the 100k = 3%+1.674% = 4.674% PA for the 4 months if I compute correctly.https://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.html,btohqsg
If withdraw no penalty but you don't get the good interest,btohqsg
Anyway he already have 100k in UOB One and potentially other liquid assets too.,btohqsg
Hi all  I try to apply for t bill using cpf in dbs bank. It states I can‚Äôt cos I do not have a cpf is account w dbs. I need to have a investing acc w dbs in order to apply t bill?,btohqsg
the citipay all in order to get 2.2m/$ is when you spend 8k min ? if not  it will still be 1.2 miles / $ with admin fee,btohqsg

If u dont hold a principle card  u are new to bank,btohqsg
if u using cpf for tbill  u need to open a cpfia a/c with the bank and u can only apply the tbill via that bank...,btohqsg
Is there charges for that cpfia acc,btohqsg
yes get bonus miles only if clock min $8k payall by 20 Aug,btohqsg
ndp promo cannot withdraw also mah,btohqsg
opening .. no but I think if u apply cpf tbill got some small fees...,btohqsg
üëç i skip. i cant hit 8k,btohqsg
Actually easy to hit haha but depends on people's appetite,btohqsg
haha.. i add almost everything only 3k. lol.. i dunno how to add to 8k sia,btohqsg
Let's just say the categories are really wide ranging and you can always find something or someone to pay,btohqsg
DBS iBanking app down again? Or just me haha,btohqsg
My advice is anything that organically is already eligible for miles  please don't use citi payall  as you are paying 2.2% in exchange for the delta difference  not 2.2mpd.Let me illustrate using an example. Assuming you can get 1.4mpd for $1K  ie 1400 miles. If you forgo that and spend 2.2% for 2.2mpd  ie 2200 miles  you are effectively paying $22 to gain an additional 800 miles only. Hence in my mind paying 2.75 cents for each of the 800 miles. Not worth it.,btohqsg
how do i view whether my transaction earns 10x points from hsbc revo? am clicking around internet banking but cannot find a link to view my points breakdown.,btohqsg
how do i check the points and whether my transactions are indeed eligible?,btohqsg
i call HSBC check 1 by 1 lol,btohqsg
understand the points system  manually track and contact hsbc if there is discrepancy,btohqsg
Thanks Popo. It's 50% upfront so about 18k. Alr applied for more 4-6mpd cards earlier this week so trying to negotiate with the restaurant to delay until cards arrive  Was thinking worst case scenario to clear the remaining with Citi Payall but David has kindly worked out that it's not worth it,btohqsg
Citipayall is definitely not worth it when you can pay with credit card at the merchant. Citipayall is useful when merchant dont take credit card or excluded merchant but u want to pay to get miles. I dont pay to get miles usually.,btohqsg
Actually  if u go down and pay today.Then next week pay again.It might workUOB Lady's points limit refresh by calendar month. So if u pay $3k each card  you get $6k spend this month. Then next week another $6k to spend.,btohqsg
Hahah ya actually that was what I suggested to clear the limits. But seems like restaurant is keen to get one shot. Still working it out,btohqsg
Appreciate all the inputs thanks people :),btohqsg
Because I open around a year ago  forgot which month...now jun  July I meet the monthly target..does it meant if meet aug  will have rebate ?? Or must go back to when application open ??Thank you  just wonder NDP promo must put the 50k or 100k one shot .or can accumulate over the weeks in the month ??,btohqsg
If use the citi pay all to pay for rental  do u think is ok?,btohqsg
Does anyone know when uob credit interest for uob one saving account?,btohqsg
It is really up to individual to view if u want to pay to buy miles. I am already earning quite alot of miles monthly for spending so that why i wont pay to buy any more miles. But if u dont mind paying for it why not.,btohqsg
2 or 3 of each month,btohqsg
Bcz now i am looking for credit card to hit my minimum spend  so that why need using my credit card to pay my rental to hit the minimum spend,btohqsg
Please check that it is included in minimum spend before u go ahead,btohqsg
Yes  if included the rental fee every month should be enough to hit. The minimum spend  bcz Singapore the rental fee is quite expensive,btohqsg
I am looking for ubo evol or citi rewards+ amaze.,btohqsg
How can u use citipayll on uob evol?,btohqsg
But i think ubo evol will be amazing,btohqsg
I am saying please check that citipayall spending will be included in the minimum spend of your credit card. There is exclusion list for every credit card,btohqsg
Bcz ubo have this card services also called Payment Facility,btohqsg
U pay fee for those payment facility  do your own calculation to see if it is worth it or not. Every individual view on miles is different,btohqsg
Yes  but cash back is 8%,btohqsg
U need to spend 300 online  300 paywave to get 40 cashback each month,btohqsg
If i use this card to pay the rental then automatically can get 40.cashback,btohqsg
Huh i dont get how u derived at this  300 online and 300 paywave,btohqsg
How do u paywave for rental?,btohqsg
After deduct the payment facility fee like 2.2%   i still can earn (40-13.2),btohqsg
