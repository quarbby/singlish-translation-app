they always send one another lol,btohqsg
1 block away only. $4.5. walk can liao,btohqsg
Panda my batch will give me $3.8 for such distance,btohqsg
one way to siam this kind of message is to ensure you swipe pickup on time and dropoff within 1 hour from published time.take screenshot of location even if u havent reach the shop (say u reach the carpark or the bldg outside then just ss). the ss is to ensure u have evidence to appeal if u kena the love letter.cos i find it annoying to explain to an automated message. if dont have automated message  CS wont find out and everyone happy cos CS less work to check.,btohqsg
Me ytd 2nd jab. Tdy fever body ache chillsüòÇ,btohqsg
For wat? Sort by location better,btohqsg
I only filter don't want to see blue colour pick,btohqsg
I heard jab liao next year still must jab... Annually till hand over ic,btohqsg
I updated the app but still don‚Äôt see the filter icon. Anyone has the same prob? Using iPhone,btohqsg
How they check. Traffic jam. Food come out late... CS where got so free call up shop shop n CHK order by orderü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Hand over IC? As in üòµ,btohqsg
thats why got 2 options1. do as per the rules and risk being kena automated message then need to find evidence to prove you are right  which can be quite tidious. then if they still think they are right then go Ubi bang table.2. swipe pick up (with photo of the shop) to prove that u arrived and wait for food to be ready  then swipe complete on time and siam the automated message. but if wanna claim waiting time u need to keep the job open until CS amend the job.we is one small fry  they have the whole system to work for them. of course cover own backside first. whether they really check we wont know also. more impt is protect ownself.,btohqsg
Means pass away lo. The only way to hand over ic is to pass away,btohqsg
Lol. Aigoo... Vaccine every year. Those work company only 7 days AL/14 days MC de  how to enough leave to survive wor. üòÖüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
