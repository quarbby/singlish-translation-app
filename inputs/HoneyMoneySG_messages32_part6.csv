Hello guys  Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s a common one. Whatâ€™s the best way for me to pay my insurance premium? ( prudential ) they donâ€™t accept Amexâ€¦ any better way other than CardUp / ipaymy?,btohqsg
Citi rewards  DBS world woman  HSBC revolution  uob signature. But with all these I donâ€™t get any rewards. Isnâ€™t ?,btohqsg
PayLah! no more $3 as of 11.16am!,btohqsg
Telco MCC probablyif you want a sure way to earn  do manual payment via the app every month,btohqsg
never test yet but i doubt so fast used up..,btohqsg
if they accept credit cardsthen AMEX TrueCashback (1.5%)  AMEX Highflyer (1.8MPD) topup grab  then use GPMC to pay on the insurer's portal,btohqsg
I think citi bank has the citi payall which can earn 1 reward point per dollar with 2% fees,btohqsg
What do you mean by manual payment via the app?,btohqsg
don't let it charge as a recurring paymentlogin and make a payment (if it allows)Like Starhub you can pay ahead of time,btohqsg
I got the high flyer card. I canâ€™t use grab pay anymore  right?,btohqsg
Yes but I have to have the grab master card for that( which I donâ€™t have ) . Axs wont work anymoreâ€¦,btohqsg
time to apply for it thenand as mentioned  if your insurer allows you to pay via credit card  you can put GPMC on file,btohqsg
Still have. Maybe the store you visited is not participating in the promotion?,btohqsg
i think still have cause the app will display run out if no more,btohqsg

For VISA  you have Maybank Platinum .... 3.33% with monthly spend of either $300 or $1000. Otherwise GPMC paired with those AMEX cards like what others have recommended.,btohqsg
Did the SGQR code have the PayLah logo?,btohqsg

Hi guys  I have the option to use CPF or cash for my part of my mortgage (co-owner)Is it wiser to use cash fully  or use CPF and top up MA (CPF shielding) with the cash instead?Thinking of what will generate the most interest per se. Cheers!,btohqsg
Investment property? Or one that you want to live in till when you are old? You have better investment vehicles for your cash?,btohqsg
I am looking to eventually upgrade from my current place. I was actually also thinking of putting the cash in other vehicles that may produce better returns as well  should I choose to pay with CPF.,btohqsg
If is an investment property  better to use cash if you have sufficient liquidity  and when you sell all capital gains you can keep and don't have to pay accrued interest. However if you have better investment vehicles that yield more and same risk profile as property investment  then use cash for those investment vehicles and use CPF to buy your investment property. My2c.,btohqsg
WIth the current high interest rate environment  using CPF to service mortgage and investing cash into something that earns > 2.5% makes sense. When rates decrease  you can always choose to use cash to repay the amount taken out from OA that was used to pay for the house.,btohqsg
Thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts!,btohqsg
Yeah this is one of the things I was thinking as well. Thanks for sharing!,btohqsg
In Singapore  leveraged annuity is a better option than investment property  IMHO.No duties  you pay a lower interest rate than mortgage interest  income not taxable  no need to deal with tenant or maintenance or any other cost such as commission for every tenancy renewal  income + capital gain same like property  but property price may drop but annuity policy value only increases,btohqsg
Do you mean if I took the topping up of CPF route? Or did I understand it wrong,btohqsg
I mean in Singapore thereâ€™s no point in getting a second residential property for investment because of the govt policies,btohqsg
With ABSD and taxable rental income,btohqsg
IMO property is more liquid then an annuity though. And it's much easier to refinance a mortgage whereas once you've taken a  loan with a bank for the purpose of leveraging a policy  you'll be at the mercy of that bank until you close the loan. There is no bank that I'm aware off that would refinance an existing policy because the main earning from the bank is from the policy purchase. If you manage to find a bank that refinances a policy loan  you won't be able to get such special loan rates anymore. Furthermore  the loan rates on leveraging is always floating  whereas a mortgage has fixed rate options.,btohqsg
In the current high interest rate environment  it's hard to leverage on a policy because the rate of return on the policy is around the same rate as loans now. If rates continue to go up  the leverage may end up diminishing the returns on the annuity instead (i.e.  if no leverage  you'd get 3% but if you take leverage of 4%  your overall yield decreases below 3% because part of the proceeds will need to offset the high interest loan).,btohqsg
In terms of liquidity  the loan value for the policy is 90% of the first day cash value  meaning any time you surrender the policy can cover the loan amount.But yes  usually itâ€™s on 1/3mth SORA. Floating and fixed rate policy is a double-edged sword. In current market for example  without a crystal ball to see how the rates will go  fixed rate will may work to your disadvantage.,btohqsg
Same with yield  with residential rental property  the rent is high because the mortgage is high. So your yield is not there. When the interest drops  rental also drops.But with annuity  the yield is constant so when rates drop  nett yield increases.,btohqsg
Also have to consider the barrier to entry. With a live-in primary residence  your dp for your investment residence need to be 25% of property value before adding in the ABSD 17% and your TDSR includes the interest and principal repayment.For leverage annuities  the initial single premium is about 20% and TDSR is negligible because you only service the interest. The principal will be paid for when the policy is surrendered.,btohqsg
