But 1 must be H1 la,btohqsg
they originally didnt want to let my friend take pxm with this niche humanities she wanted,btohqsg
but then they let her in the end,btohqsg

I kinda want to watch studio glibli,btohqsg

bascially my electone grade is teacher grade  then all the books available in sg yamaha store is japanese shows,btohqsg
but in japan  they also hold stuff like star wars,btohqsg
btw i got my book much cheaper in japan  bought 2 lol,btohqsg
unfortunately did not see yamaha in elsewhere,btohqsg
price here does not adjust for the shipping here,btohqsg
i think it is at least $30 price difference,btohqsg
so does royce...japan sells it at half price,btohqsg
I keep thinking of the chocolate.. isit that?,btohqsg
they bring very limited stuff here + over here u need to figure out the japanese website in order to buy the data,btohqsg

Even your laptop is on strike,btohqsg
U never noticed the screen brightness meh,btohqsg
Or do u have it set to full brightness all the time then wonder why the battery life dies in 5 mins,btohqsg
I dont know how people can see their devices without full brightness,btohqsg
You are the reason why every concert is an epilepsy warning,btohqsg
Talk to me when the lenses on your glasses are 3cm thick,btohqsg
What's your degree.. also mf u saw my picture well we saw the same picture of both of us,btohqsg
any optometrist can tell me how to stop my astic from flying,btohqsg
coz every time i think my eyesight worsen  my degree stays almost the same but my astics is the one flyinf,btohqsg
Is not my degree... its my astigmatism LMAO,btohqsg
wait since when do glasses make things darker,btohqsg
My degree is like 200+ only,btohqsg
I got astigmatism also I need see SNEC one,btohqsg
I think i have seen snec but i defaulted on my appointments lmao,btohqsg
when i asked my optometrist how to stop my astig to increase  all the things she said (like reading in dark / lying down  looking at phone on moving vehicles)  stuff i seldom do,btohqsg
They asking me do eye excerises,btohqsg
I also got a lazy eye that's so lazy it forgets to move,btohqsg
I can roll my eyes at the doctor very well,btohqsg
idk if it could be due to my eye condition i tend to squint too much then maybe result in astig,btohqsg
Oh i had a lazy eye too but went to correct it when i was 15,btohqsg
I can roll on of my eye well,btohqsg
Damn i do all of those,btohqsg
I never corrected it so that's why they keep the SNEC shit,btohqsg
Oh wait when i meant correct i meant surgery,btohqsg
I just say my course can liao,btohqsg
Cutting the muscle of my eye or some shit idk,btohqsg
I am too broke for that also it's like months of down time,btohqsg
I only had to be blind for like 2-3 days in which i stayed home,btohqsg
After that its back to normal,btohqsg
I need to do my readings,btohqsg

omg this is a damn solid reply fr my friend,btohqsg
she is right coz just some background is pharm has actually to some not small not great extent damage my mental health and i hv not fully recovered from it,btohqsg
sth that my parents take it like a small matter,btohqsg
lol SIA jobs -- over a 100 applicants,btohqsg

mr lim say they offer fm with 3h2s so they don't kill the fm students now or something along those lines,btohqsg
but yeah for fm is mixed 4H2 and 3H2,btohqsg
i may have taken FM if they did not force 4h2,btohqsg
is there such thing as PFMe?,btohqsg
btw CAG does not have entry level roles:-(,btohqsg
Last time yijc had one  now it disappeared after like arnd 2022 or 2023.,btohqsg
But i think jpjc and others shld have,btohqsg
TM it only appeared fr 2024ü§£,btohqsg
Coz before that FM need take 4H2  I really dk why they put it as such,btohqsg
FM now is quite more relevant to those taking engineering ever since they removed conic sections and math inductions for multivariable calculus,btohqsg
I would say FM is sorta quite useful for those taking STEM subjects,btohqsg
But actually i believe i failed the selection test coz the whole paper was proofsüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
I considered fm coz my mum told me it is easier than h2 math,btohqsg
I would have died at the proofs qns,btohqsg
Then went for the selection test and realize for myself that is bs,btohqsg
It is definitely easier than h3 math uh but more application based,btohqsg
fm looked like it'd have been fun to do,btohqsg
H2 proof is minimal + more straitforward,btohqsg
Regardless fm still need take with h2 math,btohqsg
So is like either ways  would die anyways,btohqsg
Oh it's like a req isit,btohqsg
From the subject combis right  h2 fm is always paired with h2 math,btohqsg
Yea and most sci students take h2 math anyways,btohqsg
Cus like it builds up from fm,btohqsg
Why would someone take fm and not h2 math,btohqsg
Haiz if only i can share these tips with those science camp ppl,btohqsg
fm basically speedruns h2 math first,btohqsg
I think if youre a science student by default youd have to take h2 math,btohqsg
Yea i dun recall ppl taking h1 math in sci,btohqsg
That combi requires only h1 math,btohqsg
Shared by a follower :Fight at Sim LimJOIN CHILL CORNER FOR MOREüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºüëáüèºhttps://t.me/+ENc4DWyOsihhNmY1,btohqsg
That combi is quite common for H1 Math in sci combi kind,btohqsg
Ironically dont C B and E all require learning H2 math's content in uni setting anyway lmao,btohqsg
tbh depends what area of econs you focus on outside of their initial core mods,btohqsg
I said business cus related to econs,btohqsg
Yes uni econs is a lot a lot of math,btohqsg
Yea  defo not refering to h2 econs,btohqsg
Idk if tm has a sci h1 math class,btohqsg
All i know is the top in h1 math is arts class,btohqsg
Wait ur batch hv how many s3,btohqsg
Why it feels my match seem so big,btohqsg
My batch hv like till s310,btohqsg

But omo i think they had to increase intake coz of the sudden cut down of 4 schs,btohqsg
Then maybe now they cut down intake slowly and that is why there was a year where yi was actually 19 not 20,btohqsg
Hi all any free resources and notes for studying h2 literature in english and h2 maths?,btohqsg
It took Apple 14 years to add a built in calculator into the iPad lol,btohqsg
Tbh there is no need for that for apple users given that they don't calculate anything... their very purchase of an apple product is in itself a bad financial decision,btohqsg
The new features are good sia,btohqsg
Then the answer will change automatically,btohqsg
I guess I made a bad financial decision since I‚Äôm stuck in the walled garden now,btohqsg
A walled garden u placed yourself into. Not gonna talk about if you knew of that when u did so just the fact that u did so.,btohqsg
It wasn‚Äôt really a choice at the start since my first smartphone was a 2nd hand iPhone from my parents long ago,btohqsg
I wanted to switch years back but realised a lot of stuff couldnt transfer over so I was like nvm,btohqsg
U shall bear the sins of your forefathers,btohqsg
Fire lord ozai  you and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world  and now  you shall pay the ultimate price,btohqsg

No not nice. Try to navigate NS to SS they tell u walk on the route of the Red Loop,btohqsg
I love walking from ns to ss,btohqsg
I never actually walked leisurely for that route ever,btohqsg
It was always a rush to catch smth,btohqsg
I always walk that route when i walk back to hall from spms,btohqsg
I lazy so I just take the Red Loop Bus,btohqsg
And wait 30 mins for 1 cuz peak NTU efficency,btohqsg
I made that mistake in y1s1,btohqsg
The frequency of buses in NTU drives anyone insane,btohqsg
I mean walking would take 15-20 mins too,btohqsg
10 mins more because I am lazy seems like a good trade off,btohqsg
I finish CC5 liao so can just forget about that,btohqsg
But tbf i think it is the easiest cc mod,btohqsg
Most get B+ or A- basically u gotta legit Awol to get B and below,btohqsg

10 AUs of ICC here we goooo,btohqsg
sometimes my friends just decided to go ns for lunch after lecture,btohqsg
bc we got sick of the canteen food,btohqsg
My friends is the opposite lmao we walked to Can 1 and Can 2 after lecture to avoid the queues,btohqsg
Can 1 and can 2 sucks,btohqsg
That's why no queues it was between that and a no seat SS canteen,btohqsg
Meanwhile i only eat fr 2 stores at nus sci canteen,btohqsg
wow  pulau ntu must be a food desert,btohqsg
too crowded when i had meetings at CQT near there,btohqsg
Its just a lot of canteen that sells the same kind of food lmao,btohqsg
Some of the canteens arent even that halal,btohqsg
My Muslim hallmate just ate Indomie or tapao from outside NTU,btohqsg
Can 2 got more variety but still it's sianz too,btohqsg
I always kept at least 2-3 packs of instant noodles of some sort in hall at all times. A fucking staple of hall living is feeling hungry and eating it at 2am in the morning,btohqsg
I brought my portable cooker to halls last sem,btohqsg
A fire ripped through pet shops at Bangkok's Chatuchak market earlier today  damaging more than 100 stalls.There were no reports of human casualties but multiple caged dogs  cats  birds and snakes were found dead:https://cna.asia/4bdmGoh,btohqsg
Imo the most versatile one is like an air fryer,btohqsg

btw can i ask for contract positions  is it possible to get full time after the contract,btohqsg
coz there is this role im interested in but idk if i should apply as it is a 4y contract,btohqsg
and now im also thinking about the career longetivity part,btohqsg
4 years is pretty long imo,btohqsg
idk if im planning too far ahead,btohqsg
to even think of after the 4y contract,btohqsg
but contract role sounds a bit meh meh tbh,btohqsg
does that mean pay fixed throughout the 4y?,btohqsg
Idk that's why I say depends,btohqsg
but the role is called 'manager',btohqsg
Depends on company most have annual performance reviews,btohqsg
maybe i should apply first and then ask them about these during the interview or at a later stage,btohqsg
but like what u said  4y is actually quite long,btohqsg
U get through the stages first,btohqsg
(i think im thinking too far again) but my main concern is will it be hard to leave to elsewhere if i join SIA...coz my pharm knowledge will be gone with the gap years...so idk where will i be able to go,btohqsg
coz no one stays in 1 company for their whole working life,btohqsg
because i will need to start at ground level again when i job hop,btohqsg
Huh? I didn't get what u mean.,btohqsg
oh im just worried in future  (i mean no one stays in the same job forever) if i change job  idk where can i go  and also means may need to start fr entry level again,btohqsg
time to ‚Äúreach for the skies‚Äù,btohqsg
is it ok to apply multiple jobs within the same company,btohqsg

A former NCS employee who was fired for poor work performance hacked into the company's computer systems multiple times to delete 180 of its virtual servers a few months later.These losses cost the company S$918 000. He was jailed:https://cna.asia/4bSO105,btohqsg
this is what happens when you hire a bunch of incompetents and appoint another group of incompetents to manage them. this guy couldn't even write his own script to delete the VMs. sad,btohqsg
His real name is Gurmit Singh,btohqsg
y'all too young to remember that Singapore has our own action hero,btohqsg
Actl what social medias cant be used in china,btohqsg
he used douyin to contact us,btohqsg
cause mtfker ran out of money,btohqsg
Cause alot of youtubers live in china but can post on youtube regularly,btohqsg
no wonder my friend used douyin to contact us,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why i have to use vpn,btohqsg
Cause you whatsapp us using ur vpn,btohqsg
One of my friends posted a vid of a police officer accompanying my friend at a club table on insta  funny af,btohqsg
All  even TikTok is banned there(it‚Äôs their own app),btohqsg
I bought some tourist SIM card then can use apps without restrictions but I feel like vpn more stable,btohqsg
I can only see the map,btohqsg
I going Japan end of the year (I think?),btohqsg
i wanna go back to Otaru,btohqsg
I want to stay in japan,btohqsg
End of the year  i dun think i can go japan alr  my mum say either greece or jeju island,btohqsg
Coz we went japan 3y in a row,btohqsg

I hv never really been to an island in japan,btohqsg
I just go to the landsü§£,btohqsg
I think i can go japan for the next 10yü§£,btohqsg
How to even get there tho?,btohqsg
I want to go north hokkaido next end june - july period,btohqsg
But i need to convince my friend coz she said she no money go japanü§£,btohqsg
this is reported a lot by news i think,btohqsg
Japan hv a lot of hidden gems in the less-touristy areas,btohqsg
I feel like your money can be better spent somewhere else to experience another country,btohqsg
Instead of the diminishing returns of just going to Japan again and again,btohqsg
True but idk why im so in love w japan,btohqsg
And i like the language alsoü§£,btohqsg
Meanwhile i hv not heard fr SIA and it is driving me crazy,btohqsg
Also I am surprised you have the free capital to do so given that u are non employed,btohqsg
Neh i took a jap mod in uni,btohqsg
I mean I can do so too and do a Language Immersion,btohqsg
I took jap after being in love w japan,btohqsg
There has to be a set purpose tho idk,btohqsg
Ok tbh japan was my dream travel destination and the dream came true in 2021 (first travel aft covid)  then i got in love w it,btohqsg
Then i decided to learn japanese,btohqsg
Job search is driving me crazy,btohqsg
Idk my chances w SIA  all i know is they only respond if u are shortlisted,btohqsg
dunno summer or winter here rn,btohqsg
At least got premier league matches,btohqsg
also got premium economy amenity kit from my flight v nice.,btohqsg
Singapore supposed to be 35¬∞ but only 27¬∞ now,btohqsg
i thought a wall is build,btohqsg
so tourists will use this new angle?,btohqsg
Why u never invite me to come,btohqsg
This angle is a complaint by japanese residence that a new block of flats is blocking their view of mount fuji,btohqsg
I very sad Irwen never bring me,btohqsg
The 3rd angle is a complaint by japanese that tourist are disobeying laws to get the 3rd angle,btohqsg
I was gonna use your baggage allowance,btohqsg
u sure u weigh less than 40,btohqsg
The convenience store issue was a completely different angle of mount Fuji where the Japanese also complaint about tourist,btohqsg
The most I can become your emotional support animal,btohqsg
So basically in 1 month  japanese residence have complained to authorities on seperate occasions all concerning the view of mount fujiAnd for 3 of those complaints follow up action have been done including the erecting of barriers and demolishing of a near complete housing block,btohqsg
Is enough to crash course Japanese until can get basic stuff,btohqsg
I'll prolly still wack Google translate tho,btohqsg
Oh i tot u were like is 1m enough for the whole of hokkaidoü§£,btohqsg
But I helping my family plan the trip,btohqsg
Then I see if I can,btohqsg
CUZ I NVR GO LAST YR,btohqsg
Hmm i think it depends on individuals,btohqsg
Go hokkaido then Tokyo for abit,btohqsg
Then mayhaps can go bullet train (hopefully),btohqsg
U planning to learn japanese urself or?,btohqsg
Cuz this time we going free n ez,btohqsg
Cuz idt it's practical to get proper lessons,btohqsg
Coz i feel when u start talking to someone in japanese  then help gain confidence,btohqsg
Yea it is not cheap also,btohqsg
Coz the 1st time i started conversing to a real japanese in japan  i got a bit nervous and scared,btohqsg
I think I kinda can pronounce some of the words ok,btohqsg
But it's those that I legit hear alot,btohqsg
I think the difficulty is japanese speaks really fast,btohqsg
eh but the real qn shld be,btohqsg
So learning it is one thing  but being able to converse  like hold a conversion w a japanese is another,btohqsg
How much on anime merch will I be allowed to spend this time,btohqsg
The record last yr is approx $100 sgd,btohqsg
My sis just spends on whatever she wants,btohqsg
This yr might get even worse,btohqsg
Even right fr the first day,btohqsg
Cuz I'll prolly have part time money too,btohqsg
I got quite a few things iw la,btohqsg
I think of all the places we visited as a family  we spend q a lot on shopping in jpn compared to other places,btohqsg
- food- skincare- makeup- anime merch,btohqsg
I dun recall buying anything in nz actually,btohqsg
Think my parents also thought abt going china,btohqsg
Yes skincare products (selected few) are cheaper in jpn,btohqsg
But kena vetoed cuz realise my sis will complain abt food,btohqsg
Japan got so much weird and wonderful gadgets to spend money on,btohqsg
Lol i also cant eat chn food,btohqsg
My mum spends a lot on dior coz the prices compared to sg is üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Bro anessa sunscreen i cannot eh,btohqsg
We also gonna get the hair mask,btohqsg
Dior is like $50-60 cheaper over thereüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
That gotta suck when y'all travel,btohqsg
And when i was there  there was like tax free + 5% off for tourists,btohqsg
She don't like herbalised food ah,btohqsg
I mean if u big decent amounts u can also get it Duty Free too,btohqsg
Yea it is tat much cheaper before tax free,btohqsg
So w the additional 15% disct  it is even much cheaper than sg,btohqsg
Sadly i m not discipline in skin care but omo im starting to,btohqsg
My dad pushed planning to me n it sucks planning,btohqsg
Face wash + hado lobo lotion thingy,btohqsg
I took 2 weeks of whole days,btohqsg
Meh I have to plan so many sch shit alrd üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Atp might as well make use of my training üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
But btw re u planning to take train in hokkaido or someone drives,btohqsg
No one in my family drives,btohqsg
Coz be prepared the trains in hokkaido is not like the ones in tokyo / kansai,btohqsg
And hokkaido is much bigger than any part of japan,btohqsg
The trains are still on time but it is just slower to get fr one place to another due to how big hokkaido is,btohqsg
And some are less frequent (unless u are in main sub prefectures such as sapporo),btohqsg
Prolly gonna stick to Sapporo eh tbh,btohqsg
So important to check train departure timings  u dw to waste time at the train stn,btohqsg
How is your day today Musician,btohqsg
How many days are u catering for and ideally which parts of hokkaido?,btohqsg
I haven't plan that detailed yet,btohqsg
But shld be 5 days hokkaido,btohqsg
I defo want onsen again icl,btohqsg
U gg in winter so u are skii-ing right?,btohqsg
Onsen town i would reco toyako / noboribetsu  they also hv onsen hotel (w onsen tax),btohqsg
Yea they charge onsen tax (iirc $300 per person),btohqsg
So it is wasted if u dun use their onsen facilities in the hotel,btohqsg
kinda crazy I usu nvr do planning B4 one,btohqsg
Tokyo easier to deal w I feel,btohqsg
I planned the last 2 jpn trip and ya had some screw ups,btohqsg
Prolly cuz at least kinda got go b4,btohqsg
Also more similar to sg in a sense?,btohqsg
I was there 10 days and only managed to cover half or less of hokkaido,btohqsg
We prolly don't go to alot alot of places,btohqsg
Just pick and choose some good ones then slowly vibe,btohqsg
Cuz we don't like to rush ard,btohqsg
Erm definitely tokyo and kansai trains are higher level than sg,btohqsg
This is a part that is different between me n my familyü§£,btohqsg
Coz idk but i hv unlimited energy when im overseas,btohqsg
We visit 7 eleven everyday for breakfast and my coffee,btohqsg
I went Taiwan for 1 week. Literally went to 1 7-11,btohqsg
Oh mine i also took overnight flight,btohqsg
isn‚Äôt nobori.. like full of tourists?,btohqsg
I did not really sleep on my flight  but got really tired in my 2nd leg fr hnd to hkd so somehow managed to fall asleep on my 2nd leg,btohqsg
I went to more family Marts but still it's like 15-20 convenience stores,btohqsg
Not really but i think tourists attractions there include onsen  hell valley  jidai date village,btohqsg
I think i cannot convince my family to go japan at least for 1-2y,btohqsg
Hokkaido is also pretty good to go during flower blooming season in summer tho,btohqsg
Im salty this yr i miss the peak blooming by a month,btohqsg
In fact a few days coz now it has more flowers alreadyüò¢,btohqsg
that ‚Äòs true. I visited twice,btohqsg
Definitely hokkaido cannot compare to kansai and tokyo for number of tourists,btohqsg
Yea but it is also a nice place to visit,btohqsg
I hv not covered the northern half of Hokkaido,btohqsg
And i would want go furano again during peak blooming in july,btohqsg
do u get around by train or car rental?,btohqsg
Yea i took a domestic flight fr tokyo (even ANA does not fly direct to Hokkaido coz i think not as demandful as some other areas),btohqsg
In hakodate we use the city tram then rented a car  drove down fr hakodate to sapporo  then in sapporo we take train / tram  and 2 day tours out of sapporo,btohqsg
A boo boo is uk the japan expressway has got a digital speed limit sign  so we were following that  then realized how come cars ard seem to be driving faster  are they speeding,btohqsg
