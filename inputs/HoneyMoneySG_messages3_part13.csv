Based on advance estimates*  the Singapore economy grew by 5.9 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2021  moderating from the 7.1 per cent growth in the previous quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis  the economy expanded by 2.6 per cent in the fourth quarter  faster than the 1.2 per cent growth in the preceding quarter.For the whole of 2021  the economy grew by 7.2 per cent  rebounding from the 5.4 per cent contraction in 2020.*The advance GDP estimates for the fourth quarter of 2021 are computed largely from data in the first two months of the quarter (i.e.  October and November 2021). They are intended as an early indication of GDP growth in the quarter and are subject to revision when more comprehensive data become available.,btohqsg
Was there a review on CRO?,btohqsg
Yes I think so  just need to stake differing amounts of CRO for the level/tier card that you want,btohqsg
Haha I think is really based on personal preference. My sense is that generally most might either get the Royal Indigo/Jade Green and Ruby Steel since they offer marginal benefits over the Midnight Blue eg. Spotify  Netflix and Airport Lounge Access. But also depends your own conviction about CRO (and hence the amount you are willing to stake) cos you‚Äôll need to lock in for about 6 months I think,btohqsg
Oh ok it seems blue card dont need staking,btohqsg
Indigo and above will get 10% pa on the staking. But stake at sgd5k.,btohqsg
If staked amount dip due to cro dip  need to topup again?,btohqsg
$500 red card is more affordable  but no staking returns.,btohqsg
What do you mean by no staking returns?,btohqsg
If you get the red card  the $500 staked does not give you any weekly returns. It just gets locked in for the red card benefits.,btohqsg
How about blue or green card?,btohqsg
But weekly only like a dollar or sometbing like that only right,btohqsg
Say at the point of staking it was sgd1 per CRO  so you staked 5000 CRO for Indigo card.In 1 year you will get 500 CRO (regardless of price fluctuation). So every week you get 500/12 or 41.66 CRO.,btohqsg
Sorry  should be 500/52 or 9.61 CRO.,btohqsg
Calculations are based on CRO  not fiat value.,btohqsg
Aiya regret getting the ruby card,btohqsg
To clarify  blue card which is plastic card  does not require staking. It give 1% CRO rebate for purchases.The green / Indigo card (metal card) gives 3% purchase rebate and 10% from the sgd5k staking.,btohqsg
Let's wait for Honey Money review. Probably can get clearer picture.,btohqsg
"@ChrisHMSG  I just realized that I have $10K in CPF ""available for Gold investment"". How do I take that out for gold investments??",btohqsg
If you get the red card  the $500 staked does not give you any weekly returns. It just gets locked in for the red card benefits.,btohqsg
Then might as well get red card direct,btohqsg
You don't take it out. You link your OA to your gold bullion exchange. Regarding the specifics  I'm not sure,btohqsg
ForCrypto.comCRO Visa card  need minimum Ruby tier (500 SGD of CRO staked) to get any useful benefits,btohqsg
Airport lounge  spotify  netflix benefits all these are just fluff. Most importantly  do you believe in CRO to grow in the future  if yes then stake more and you can unlock hogher tier in Crypto Earn,btohqsg
If you staked 5000 sgd cro just for netflix and stuff. Just a 10% drop in cro enough to wipe all the benefits you gained,btohqsg
If get blue card first  later can upgrade to other cards free?,btohqsg
The upgrade will still require the staking conditions. There is also admin charge of USD50 for card delivery. Only first card will be delivered FOC.,btohqsg
Yes  true. Need to believe in CRO and DYOR.,btohqsg
So all in all  if I am a holder of a Ruby Card  I will not enjoy the benefits of weekly returns right? Except for anything above Ruby card?,btohqsg
üòçüòçüòç I have been waiting for this!!! üòçüòçüòç,btohqsg
After applying this standard chartered card smart credit how long we must hold it before allow to canceled it off,btohqsg
I can find it any where the team and conditions,btohqsg
Guideline is 6 mths to be safe  but no definite timeline actually,btohqsg
Those not listed are not eligible,btohqsg
Wrong. U earn points  which can convert to Cashback or miles,btohqsg
I don't get why you keep want to put cash in your credit card  it's not a deposit account,btohqsg
No annual fees for scb smart,btohqsg
I think what you are looking for is a debit card,btohqsg
Credit card is pretty self explanatory. Credit = lend money to spend and pay later,btohqsg
It doesn't matter whether you are spending the money you deposit beforehand  as long as you don't go beyond your budget and pay you bills,btohqsg
they are just numbers on your bill  no need to top up first and then spend,btohqsg
for the smartcard does buying groceries at sheng siong also eligible for cashback?,btohqsg
What is the exclusion for smart card?,btohqsg
Is this the next better card since Revolut cashback for transport is over?,btohqsg
There is only inclusion category for SCB Smart card  other spend are all excluded  that simple.,btohqsg
Chris will you be concern on the us tapering and interest increase will it impact on the lion global infinity fund. Elon musk predicted some where around summer time market will crush.,btohqsg
I will divert this question to@boontee86,btohqsg
lion global infinity fund is s&p500?,btohqsg
That track s & p 500 index,btohqsg
But groceries does count to your spending right.,btohqsg
