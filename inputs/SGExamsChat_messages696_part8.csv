he prob doesnt like taylor swift,btohqsg
Ah yes cookhouse laksa made from killiney laksa paste but they sift out the oil,btohqsg
our schooling experiences are quite different,btohqsg
and he said like stuff that make me buay song before,btohqsg
so tbh idrw talk to him,btohqsg
ok yk what i see if he talk first,btohqsg
if he does then i entertain,btohqsg
I love maths and I want to stretch myself. I want to expand my maths knowledge and play with numbers so I can make more Math songs and poems. And most of all  I want to use these numbers to make movies and music or just for the fun of it and to inspire other girls to love Maths. The gender gap in STEM is disproportionately skewed towards guys so I want to shine that light and open the door for girls and women everywhere,btohqsg
god i skip too many tuitions,btohqsg
reminds me of my cdac tuition,btohqsg
just sumtimes too tired when sch ends at 1 and it starts from 4 to 7,btohqsg
also dam cb on the same day the guitar ensemble has their cca at the library,btohqsg
Why do you even sign up for them,btohqsg
great now my pld cant login to the acc ffs,btohqsg
Still probably wonâ€™t absorb as much as a live class,btohqsg
I kind of wish I can be like him but I doubt Iâ€™ll be able to assimilate well into Japanese society,btohqsg
some people can and prefer it,btohqsg
Yeah but unlike a zoom/physical class  you canâ€™t interact with the tutor,btohqsg
If the video recording is to watch at oneâ€™s own pace  can rewatch it later,btohqsg
But should still join the live class,btohqsg
Also for subjects like math it would very important to attend the class live so that the tutor can help spot any mistakes you make  sometimes just watching a recorded video isnâ€™t enough and you canâ€™t tell where you went wrong,btohqsg
just somedays i may have other projects after sch and my brain is just cooked,btohqsg
not enuff focus for 2 classes,btohqsg
Guys he starting to yap about unhealthy foods already,btohqsg
jn i was saying my mother drag me out to meet her friend and her son is coming along  but i dont like himthen now he yapping about which foods are unhealthy,btohqsg
just nod your head every few moments,btohqsg
i dont even acknowledge him im just eating my own food,btohqsg
if he complain ltr just say i tried to talk to him but we dh anything to talk about,btohqsg
i hear him yap i want to ðŸ˜´alr,btohqsg
his voice is very annoying ðŸ˜­ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Women actually get the same number of opportunities as guys  at least in SG,btohqsg
What subjects you attend tuition for tho,btohqsg
oh that's not my post it's a copypasta of what some other person said,btohqsg
If math should definitely try going for on site classes as much as you can,btohqsg
Maybe for humans subjects recorded video is more suitable,btohqsg
my sch with prerecorded math lectures ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
tbh i dont even watch the lectures,btohqsg
you canâ€™t generalise this to everyone,btohqsg
Like I guess if you need individual attention in sch  you would need consults whereas with group tuition the classes should not be too large such that the tutor can still go around to ask if students have any doubts they can clarify. If your tutorial class is not too large your teacher might also be able to give you some attention,btohqsg
math live classes arenâ€™t always useful either,btohqsg
this is wholly dependent on the tutor and how they go about it,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why I think it depends on the subjects. But in general live will be better for most,btohqsg
tbh yea i also don't understand large group tuitions because if you cant learn in a class group setting to the point that you need tuition what makes you think you can learn in a tuition group setting,btohqsg
no no im not saying online classes are better for me,btohqsg
just that sumtimes i too fatigued,btohqsg
whether someone prefers live or not is dependent on both the subjects and the person itself,btohqsg
whatâ€™s the point of attending if you arenâ€™t gonna be able to focus on it,btohqsg
tho my phy/chem cher oso not thattt great,btohqsg
My math tuition centre tutor will always go around during class to help students with their work which is especially useful since I often get stuck doing qns and canâ€™t tell where I went wrong even after looking at the suggested answer,btohqsg
gonna go jun weis one next time fr,btohqsg
