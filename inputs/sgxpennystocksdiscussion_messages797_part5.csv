Even our old Lee oso 菩萨再来,btohqsg
It is not due to him. It was due to so many leaders before him who built China to what it was before he wrecked it. That is my view lah,btohqsg
As I said  if not so much progress n accumulated he will not have the resources to do what is has been doing n I feel he got to where he is through treachery I don’t like,btohqsg

XI did not make China prosperous. It was already prosperous when he came along,btohqsg
If anything he's not been doing any good for China economy,btohqsg
Still he did not damage it,btohqsg
Yes he did. There is lots of discontent and unemployment now,btohqsg
You don't see it from outside the country,btohqsg
XI has been bad for China. That much I can say,btohqsg
I've been here for many many years,btohqsg
China has been regressing under XI,btohqsg
Back to CCP style nonsense. Before that it was modernizing,btohqsg
If XI was doing a good job  those people won't be fleeing to SG,btohqsg
