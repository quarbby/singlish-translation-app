They cancelled mine even though I got the job first. N I got to the resto b4 the bike job guyü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
The bike job cheaper than mine by 20centsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
So I don't take getz job anymore,btohqsg
Waste cp. Time n petrol ok cos I was very near  only 5 mins awat,btohqsg
I just don't take their order,btohqsg
Cos most of the time the control is via the platform they use,btohqsg
Unless it's the resto itself order via llm,btohqsg
If its those platforms using llm  then they can cancel anyhow n up to them. Even when u reach the resto,btohqsg
I kena b4  reach the resto liao. Show them the order  told me still preparing but cos I early so I ok,btohqsg
Then halfway thru  my job was cancelledü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
I ask the resto  they nvr cancel,btohqsg
Then they go check the apps page,btohqsg
The driver changed to another driver. They also cannot do anytg,btohqsg
The other driver the 1 he got no +$  n is not llm,btohqsg
It's the ordering platform that do this stunt,btohqsg
Alot of orders restos receive are thru pple ordering thru oddle  Chinatown platform etc,btohqsg
So the restos just prepare the food etc,btohqsg
It's like if u go thru oddle eat  u order from a certain resto  then oddle eats will send the order to the resto to prepare. Oddle eats in charge of getting the driver thru whichever delivery platform they decide to use,btohqsg
Restos have a chat gp with oddle etc,btohqsg
When they get a driver  they will be informed on the chat  who is the driver name etc,btohqsg
Sometimes when alot of orders etc,btohqsg
Even if the resto ask for cancellation,btohqsg
If oddle don't respond or do fast  also cannot cancel,btohqsg
Unless it's the resto ask for the driver direct using llm,btohqsg
If the resto forget or nvr tell oddle cancel  then the order also won't be cancelled,btohqsg
Resto nvr inform oddle food already picked up  so oddle nvr cancel  so still come out orders to llm,btohqsg
Or resto tell oddle liao  oddle haven't cancel the new orders sent to llm,btohqsg
Or oddle have difficulty informing llm maybe due to llm uncontactable  which I know happens  cos those resto order direct thru llm  also have to go thru cs which also very slowüòÇ,btohqsg
Got 1 time I reach the job was taken liao. I ask resto y nvr cancel. They show me they on livechat very long cs no replyüòÇ,btohqsg
So if pickup now jobs  which u see the time it appears is very late from original delivery time liao  better call n check with the resto b4 u go down pickupüòÇ,btohqsg
Another situation is resto cannot wait for llm drivers liao  they get other platform go pickup  then they either nvr inform oddle/llm  or inform liao then oddle/llm haven't cancel,btohqsg
All these is what I see b4 n kena b4. Maybe got other things or some of the above not correct. Everyone is welcome to share,btohqsg
I pickup those 6-7pm supposed to deliver. When I got the job is 8pm liao,btohqsg
Ah this type I suggest u screenshot the order once u got the job,btohqsg
N make a call to the resto,btohqsg
The screenshot n call log is for the compensation/late report which llm will send to u,btohqsg
I will always call the customer when I pick up the food n tell them resto couldn't get driver n I just pick up the food.,btohqsg
I always ask the resto when I reach if they had informed the customer. Most of them nvr call 1. Even if they say they will call  don't trust them. U better call. Cos a number of times the customer tell me they nvr got a call from resto,btohqsg
Just tell the customers what happened  most of the time they will know not ur fault. I nvr got scold by customer b4. Even got tip b4 for sending the foodüòÇ,btohqsg
Just remember cover ur backside for evrything. Cos no1 will protect us,btohqsg
"1 more thing. If the order is those ""rescue"" job  when u call the resto to cfm the order  let them know u about how long can reach. Some cannot wait so long then if got nearer driver take the job they will accept it. Then u reach liao u nothing to take. Waste time n peteol",btohqsg
Again all these is my own experience.,btohqsg
"To me ""rescue"" order is if let's say the job suppose to deliver btw 6-7  if already half hour gone liao  then u got the job  is rescue liaoüòÇ",btohqsg
Cos u need time to reach resto. Then deliver. By the time u deliver will be pass the inital delivery time frame,btohqsg
Cos if oddle want complain  they see u delivered the food pass the initial time liao  then complain u late. So I keep all the screenshot n call log,btohqsg
If u nearby or is gg to where u gg  y not pickup. Ok 1. Anything happen not ur fault as long as u have the proof. But of cos for rescue order try to deliver it first if u stack lahüòÇ,btohqsg
Wa good idea ah  at least you cover your backside. Going to follow this,btohqsg
I don't want for no reason have to pay or kena suspension,btohqsg
N pls keep in mind they don't send u the compensation/late sms immediately within next few days or the following week. They will send to u quite long after the job day. If u don't keep record  n u forget then very hard to track back n remember the details of what happen on that job,btohqsg
At least 1 month i keep the log later then delete should be ok?,btohqsg
