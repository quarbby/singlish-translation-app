Nvm cant find  but basically he randomly talks about how he have low O level score,btohqsg

Ik more hci people that are normal than RI people,btohqsg
Of the 7 RI graduates that I can recall  2 are normal 5 have pissed me off,btohqsg
Man how did y'all even manage to interact with them,btohqsg
I find rjc Students really insecure for some reason,btohqsg
only had interaction cause of CCA sch exchange/camp,btohqsg
But I think most students in elite jcs fall in this category,btohqsg
for a lot of them it's feeling the need to keep up with the top ones,btohqsg
I did an internship with 3 ri students before,btohqsg
They're work quality was so bad,btohqsg
Like you can tell by the superiors face they were like wtf,btohqsg
you tell me one of the 3 ok but all 3 is q the concerning,btohqsg
Like 0 thought put in that kind,btohqsg
Err I have 1 HCI friend,btohqsg
my post NS intern i worked with mostly JC then one guy finished o levels entering poly,btohqsg
So my sample size also q skewed,btohqsg
the o levels guy had the best work quality,btohqsg
Also idk why but apparantly most RI students go to PPE,btohqsg
Can we add him back here and ask for his o level score,btohqsg
Cuz I was the token non ri guy,btohqsg
In a room of ri kids,btohqsg
And when they did the evaluation at the end by all the bosses,btohqsg
I got higher than all 3 of them combined,btohqsg
But wtv that's just one isolated instance,btohqsg
i got my intern through nepotism but fuck the others all sucked ass,btohqsg
It's also cuz I think I put in the most effort?Like literally it was some ura thing,btohqsg
Supposed to analyze like some area,btohqsg
I did the entirety of bishan,btohqsg
One part of their own neighbourhood,btohqsg
Maybe thats why I had the most to actually talk abt,btohqsg
If that fails I'll just be a backup dancer,btohqsg

The first thing that came into my mind was like kpop backup dancers kinda dancers LOL,btohqsg
Like if she sees me on the street she would say hi to me (I know this cuz it happened when I was abt to go buy dinner a few days ago),btohqsg
Whatever the one is in charge of the people,btohqsg
She's always on the ground at least and she actually listens to her residents opinions and voices,btohqsg
Like she makes changes very quickyl,btohqsg
Especially when she say the shit about ns cannot be measured with dollars and cents,btohqsg

When she was in charge of Bishan North she was gd,btohqsg
Then now idk who it is but he's fucking useless,btohqsg
She fucked off during the 2020 elections,btohqsg
And also joteo was q popular in bishan north area at least,btohqsg
