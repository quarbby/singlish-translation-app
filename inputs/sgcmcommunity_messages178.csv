I think dealer all scared is themselves jacking the coe up,btohqsg
Cus LTA come out w that statistic,btohqsg
They ownself know they need control also,btohqsg
Current COE PriceCAT A: $93889 (1121/924)CAT B:$105001(781/636)CAT C:$77801(278/190)CAT D:$10502(604/520)CAT E:$122001(219/141),btohqsg
No more cat B 150k Coe 🙏,btohqsg
Dealer know they next on chopping board if price dont come down,btohqsg
those who bid for cat B hosei,btohqsg
Ok la then previous Cat B bidder have the highest bidder badge,btohqsg
don know which sucker play pranker slap another 15k on top,btohqsg
NOVEMBER 2023 1st Open Bidding Exercise has endedCat QP Change Bids/Quota PQPCAT A $95 689 ↓$10 311 (1 165/924) $102 584(Nov)CAT B $110 001 ↓$40 000 (830/636) $138 094(Nov)CAT C $78 001 ↓$6 789 (281/190) $83 714(Nov)CAT D $10 889 ↓$312 (630/520) $11 094(Nov)CAT E $125 011 ↓$32 993 (227/141),btohqsg
Can tell people their COE depre 15k per year,btohqsg
ya coz the lowest price bid that strike whole quota will be the final rpice,btohqsg
It’s a tactic. Raise COE sky high then drop back to a range that is still considered high  but ppl will think it’s a steal lol,btohqsg
next round i also bid cat b,btohqsg
i submit $60k try my luck,btohqsg
3 mins ago cat b less than cat A,btohqsg
i tot system siao liao sekali......,btohqsg
Just need drop back to 50 60k,btohqsg
Then I straightaway renew PQP le,btohqsg
Very very hard and pqp is an average so need a consistent drop over a few rounds which is harder,btohqsg
Lol yah we can only pray,btohqsg
More work is needed on those dealers  best is shorten the holding period to 5 days,btohqsg
just proves our theories werent wrong,btohqsg
to have 1/4 of cars for PHV per bidding is alot also,btohqsg
Cat A $95Cat B $110Though drop  but still expensive,btohqsg
Maybe near election better  they will allocate more COE to increase the supply,btohqsg
Then when all happy buy already and election over  they introduce erp 2.0,btohqsg
got some ppl say must crash,btohqsg
Dealer will still push for hybrid to be sold asap. The rebate of 20k going to be only 5k next year onwards,btohqsg
If no sell hard to clear stock,btohqsg
Remember the motorbike cat  dropped in 1st round  shot up next. Due to e bike sharing company,btohqsg
Cat B drops a lot sia,btohqsg

Then am right that will be charges 5 plus the number of hrs from now to 10.30am,btohqsg
8.30-10.30pm - 2.40   10.30pm to 7.30am $5,btohqsg
just make sure cashcard got sufficient value. Dont be the one blocking everyone else at the gantry can liao,btohqsg
1 more silly question am i right that so for noght charges is 5 buck even is i enter at 12am will still be 5 bucks also right,btohqsg
After 10.30  once it ur parking hits $5 it will be $5,btohqsg
Frm 10.30pm  its per min till it hits the $5. Then will b $5 till tomorrow morning 7,btohqsg

Hi can I appeal for any witnesses regarding an accident today at approximately 1:25pm along Pasir Ris drive 3 towards Loyang Ave? Unsure why my dash cam didn’t capture any footage. TIA.,btohqsg
Green is my lane of travel  red is the lane of travel for the vehicle involved with me. He collided into my right rear as he went straight instead of turning.,btohqsg
No haha just another dealer trying to boost their telegram subs and pushing deals,btohqsg
Hope insurance isn't giving you a hard time,btohqsg
Reported SG Cars [-1001780046430] to admins.,btohqsg
You say one ah  you not dealer ah  cos I just checked out sg cars amongst others just days ago,btohqsg

either way also digging a deeper hole lmao,btohqsg
Promoting your own company on another company chat,btohqsg
imagine botorist come here and promote their tele,btohqsg
Thanks. Hopefully the other party doesn’t turn around and say I was the one that turned and collided into him,btohqsg
Responsible drivers are far from few nowadays,btohqsg
The green is my lane of travel. His lane of travel is the red  supposedly right turn only however when I was turning right he drove straight into me and collided into my right rear.,btohqsg
So yup.. cos my dash cam wasn’t able to capture  unsure if he will turn the story around. However he did admit liability in person saying he went straight after he was confused by the lane marking perhaps due to the downpour. Nonetheless it’s over.. just hope things get past. Not trying to implicate things.,btohqsg
Always good practice to pull out a paper and pen when taking details and just get a basic statement admitting fault,btohqsg
Protects you in the case there's any dashcam issues,btohqsg
And good in case they decide to go for direct settlement instead of insurance too,btohqsg
Ya. Too bad we were in a middle of a major cross junction & it was pouring quite heavily. Stupid me decided to rely on my dashcam..,btohqsg
Good sign to upgrade to better dashcam,btohqsg
But thanks for the tip! I guess it’s a learning experience :-),btohqsg
Wanted to get it replaced today but they couldn’t do the mobile one today as they were fully booked.,btohqsg
Always good to invest on dashcam  spare tyre hydraulic jack/sealant+air pump etc.,btohqsg
Stuff you won't really use but would regret not having when you need it the most,btohqsg
Try filing a police report. They can extract footages since cctvs are everywhere now,btohqsg
Yes. I’ve requested for footage from the shell just in front of the cross junction. Hopefully the management will grant me access to the footage. I’ll look and see if there needs to be further action taken from here since I aren’t able to get any footage. Hopefully I don’t have to resort to legal actions as it’s honestly just a small incident and we all make mistakes as humans. But thanks for all of your valuable input and advices  I truly appreciate it.,btohqsg
I had a similar experience. I was going the same way you were in green but a driver turned right into my car when she is supposed to be going straight only thinking I was going to turn right (i was not signalling). I still asked if she was ok or not and she was shaken  saying sorry and all. I wondered afterwards why my insurance claim was taking so long and my insurer told me they asked for 50:50 because she submitted a statement saying I was speeding on the other lane and I came out of nowhere. I told them I was not going to waste any more time on this and will get my lawyer involved. 100% almost immediately after.,btohqsg
There are spin doctors so statements immediately are useful  if you can get one.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. Yup  a lot of actors and actresses nowadays who don’t conform to their lanes properly  but when it comes to taking responsibility  all of a sudden it’s everyone’s fault.,btohqsg

Yes  I just bought 4 pcs hankook from carousell at 620nett.,btohqsg
Whats the typical mileage for tyres?,btohqsg
depends on a lot of factors,btohqsg
how often you maintain tyre pressures,btohqsg
what kind of tyres you're using  econo tyres or performance compounds etc ,btohqsg
every tyre type different in compound  tread and composition,btohqsg
Majority on Singapore road. Sometimes on malaysia roads. On Fuel-saving Eco tyres (not budget). Rarely goes off road,btohqsg
say you run a tyre with lower load index than recommended by manufacturer,btohqsg
the best way to measure tyre life is not to use KM,btohqsg
but tread wear indicator or tread depth gauge,btohqsg
what weight each tyre is rated to,btohqsg
Need to researh on how to see falken tyres. Bought in 2020,btohqsg
there will be a standard bar in the middle of the trad pattern,btohqsg
if your tread is close to or at the bar already you should consider changing,btohqsg
but not botak cannot do doughnuts,btohqsg
Its on my beetle la. Just dunno when should be a good time to change to a higher profile tyre,btohqsg
Usually new tyres are at 8 to 9mm tread depth and you can drive until they reach 1.6mm but it's recommended to change when they reach 3mm,btohqsg
why do you want to change to higher profile? any specific reason?,btohqsg
also if your tyres aren't too worn but you want to change  you can always do so by selling your used to tyres to the tyre shop,btohqsg
doesn't get you much but at least you don't throw them away,btohqsg
they're willing to pay as long as your tread higher than 50%,btohqsg
This one too much la. But will look nice on a safari,btohqsg
you'd have to significantly increase to feel a big difference,btohqsg
Current tyres are slightly smaller compared to stock,btohqsg
as you can see not too much of a difference,btohqsg
If profile is not shown it is noted to be default 80,btohqsg
So far I am looking at Van's 195R15C  cos that is 195/80R15,btohqsg
the wider cross section definitely helps,btohqsg
Looking at 165/80R15 front and 195/80R15 rear. So it won't look too off balancce.,btohqsg
15inch dont have 70 or 75 Profile  sadly,btohqsg
195R15C are essential Toyota HiAce Tyres,btohqsg
Yes  I think for a high sidewall like that you'd have to go commercial sizing,btohqsg
Load index with commercial tyres should not be an issue as they usually have a higher one,btohqsg
and i'm sure your beetle isn't going too fast anywhere so speed rating being decent enough should be fine,btohqsg
check for brands that are tested and have safety ratings though,btohqsg
i.e. don't get tourador or rydanz,btohqsg
Those pasted tourador stickers be trippin bro,btohqsg
I would put all 3 brands together,btohqsg
How bro your rydanz kena diss,btohqsg
btw is there a website that listed all the test done by EU? I think at least that is a benchmark I can rely on.They measure fuel economy and wet braking,btohqsg
Do I still need VEP to enter Malaysia?,btohqsg
no  but need pay 20RM for the VEP by TnG,btohqsg
At the custom that’s all right?,btohqsg
The instructions i saw was just register dont need do anything yet,btohqsg
Yes register but need not do anything,btohqsg
I registered last year so far did nothing after that,btohqsg
Wait for them stop flip prata first bah. I dun see why need thr VEP stuck unto our vehicle but not for thailand veh,btohqsg
Just wanna take our money anyways,btohqsg
then change of garment they said can continue to use tng,btohqsg
Essentially VEP for SG must be Mahathir idea. Dk why he dislike us so much,btohqsg
We contribute to Johor economy as well anyways,btohqsg
I believe there is a benefit for registering your car details. In case your car disappeared there,btohqsg
My only idea of y register vep is important,btohqsg
hey U scammer dont bother reporting me,btohqsg

pls wait him confirm. Cant really remember all  esp mk 8,btohqsg

So the scirocco r from like 2012 should be the mk7 right,btohqsg
The first DSG transmission  the DQ250 (02E)  is introduced in a series-production car during the launch of the Golf Mk4 R32 back in 2003. During the design Volkswagen AG combined the advantages of manual and automatic transmissions into one completely new gearbox generation: the direct shift gearbox (DSG). It has been especially designed for VAG vehicles with an engine torque up to 350-380 Nm like the sportier versions of the Golf (GTI and R models).,btohqsg
Ah i see . Thanks !,btohqsg
Dry one saves 20kg of weight,btohqsg
IF this car was actually a split second faster than you and ahead of you such that the collison is you bang into his side  even though he didnt obey the road marking  whose fault?,btohqsg
confirm the car not obeying road markings la,btohqsg
50-50 lah from my pov lol,btohqsg
You better go back to study theory again then lol,btohqsg
If really follow law then 80-20 lor,btohqsg
Which part of going straight on a left turn only lane do you not get? 😒,btohqsg
I'm talking about insurance claims btw not whose fault or not,btohqsg
I got similar case but at 2-lane roundabout  msian biker from inner lane exit the roundabout on the first exit  while im on the outer lane exiting second exit. he tried to cut right infront of me  appeared in front of me out of nowhere. i bang his side. i lost the case. AXA banned me,btohqsg
Means he didnt exit the first exit la..,btohqsg
of course i didnt let him exit,btohqsg
No i meant how can u say he exit first exit,btohqsg
Yet met u at the second exit,btohqsg
He won abt 10k plus in claim can go back msia shake leg for a while,btohqsg
ywellow is him  blue is me,btohqsg
Actually from the video  he got intention to change lane or cut in,btohqsg
One conclusion: neither singaporeans nor Malaysians know how to use roundabouts,btohqsg
2nd exit: stay in inner lane until you pass the first exit. 1st exit: stay on the outer lane don't try anything funny,btohqsg
https://www.sgcarmart.com/articles/advice/4-things-you-need-to-know-about-using-a-roundabout-33502From this article  I am nt wrong for using the outer lane to exit on the 2nd exit,btohqsg
So both at fault. But obviously car hit biker car loses,btohqsg
Oh  i was riding bike too,btohqsg
Then yes your insurance definitely is crap,btohqsg
back to this  i think 50 50 also if OP bang him. alot of ways to argue sia,btohqsg
If like tht is 50/50  then no need buy insurance liao,btohqsg
Nothing to argue one is legal one is not...,btohqsg
Did you forget to bring your logic with you ah,btohqsg
Nvm its ok. im just asking a hypothetical qn. Im just sharing a case of mine which Im surprised at the verdict. You and I are not the ultimate assessors of accident cases. no need to get personal,btohqsg
And ur insurance n law firm sucks,btohqsg
Its clear cut. Traffic police summon will further strengthen the claim,btohqsg
Going straight on a left turn only lame causing accident w injury,btohqsg
Failure to adhere to road markings,btohqsg
The only tht cannot claim him is pray he is nt drink driving,btohqsg

Is sgcm gg to remove ownership count in their listings?,btohqsg
I wan to state here for the sgcm admin to know  removing the ownership count from sgcm listing is different from govt removing. Cos if sgcm remove but govt website still can check  no point,btohqsg
Ppl still can approach dealers to check  or check in lta website perhaps,btohqsg
If people are complaining that owner count is resulting in their cars unable to let go  that's their problem for buying it in the first place,btohqsg
If you knew a man's/woman's body count very high you will still date them?,btohqsg
Its concentrated on how many owners,btohqsg
Make it more mafan for lay people,btohqsg
We have to go down to dealer,btohqsg
And dealer can choose nt to reveal until u down deposit or u pay money to search,btohqsg
Parking charges will shoot through the roof,btohqsg
U die  i die  everybody die,btohqsg
Operating cost will replace the COE,btohqsg
😆 reminds me of the uncle,btohqsg
Seems like it  like maybe the ppl who list the car wants it  either dealers or ppl who ownself sell,btohqsg
Just feel if u cant be honest w the amt of owners the car has  dont think u will be very honest abt the condition of ur car and stuff,btohqsg
Sidenote: LTA shud do a tracker to know whether the car has been converted to PHV or converted FROM,btohqsg
That is so correct  that's why unless govt remove it  else sgcm remove no point,btohqsg
Hard to be honest  cos nobody wan to buy it. I see a freed listed in carro  among defects listed there's a gearbox suspected issue and steering vibration  wonder who would still buy. But I salute their effort and would consider buying from them cos quite transparent,btohqsg
Need to be transparent in this. They have the numbers. Just tht nt revealed,btohqsg
Meanwhile other countries like Sydney  Aus parking is $30 a hour in CBD  even if coe dont exist  it wouldnt be as simple as everything is cheaper,btohqsg
All come back to bite u in other ways,btohqsg
Thts y i say  operating cost will kill u,btohqsg
Fuel price for one will increase,btohqsg
Nowadays  CTE high volume traffic round the clock,btohqsg
11am  no one in office meh,btohqsg
Cte can be slow moving both ways,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know if it will be an issue at immigration if I drive into JB with 2 adults and 2 toddlers (1year old n 4year old) in rear seat? Mine is a normal hatchback car,btohqsg
No child seat if caught pay $$ only lor,btohqsg
Worst case scenario just engage undertaker to bring the dead bodies back,btohqsg
But must be to the level where it deter people from driving. If we take only example 100k Coe divide by 365 days x 10 years  that is only like $27.40 a day. That price is very palatable for most people  will not deter most people like what COE do now (100k upfront).,btohqsg
Most likely of they want to bake it to running cost  they going to increase everything else which if we compare to our current system  we end up paying more,btohqsg

If govt allow me to pay coe via 27 dollars daily I sure can afford car🤭,btohqsg
One of my friend just got his driving license he is driving Toyota wish,btohqsg
Of course they allow. Its called car loan.,btohqsg
Yah then dealer earn interest from coe,btohqsg
If u see coe cannot loan then u might see coe prices dropping😄😏,btohqsg
Usually how much do they earn one?,btohqsg
Now shud be higher cus interest rate so high,btohqsg
Imagine lo if sgcm is 2.28% and they loan outsidr is 2.78  i assume they earn thr 0.05%,btohqsg
Ur car 200k  30% DP loan 7 yrs..,btohqsg
Bank dont do  legal lenders will do,btohqsg
Are you really fr sg car mart? Admin please notify,btohqsg

Hi Guys  is there such alert display for mercs  parking for extended period? Interested in a used merc  dealer told me would see a message  but don't be alarmed.. It will go away after driving for few kms,btohqsg
A long message about the brake from the mbux display... Sucks  i didn't take the screenshot. Tomorrow I am going to see the car again.,btohqsg
Got such thing one? Sounds like something dealer would say to hide the car issues lol,btohqsg
On raining day park back near ur house cp. After rain stop park back to the ev charging cp. Leceh but considering the money saved for fuel price,btohqsg
Free shipping and all taxes to Sg with all paper work borne by u?,btohqsg
Guys  generally if buying relatively new car  one year old  am I wasting money for sending in for pre purchase inspection? It looks new  smell new  check the engine  all clean and tidy. Any opinion?,btohqsg
Depends. The minute the engine is cranked and driven on the roads  there will be mechanical risk and risk of accidents. Up to every individual’s appetite for such things. Also PI/AD  adoption fee payable etc etc etc depending on make. some will say you’re wasting money. Some will say you’re spending good money.  How? What is your opinion? First car?,btohqsg
Just got out of Covid. Say no to virus. 🦠,btohqsg
Everyone is out to cheat ur money,btohqsg
😂😂 that should be ur mindset,btohqsg
When it comes to buying the car,btohqsg
"Usually if still have the warranty should be ok  just take note that typical wear and tear will not be covered in the warranty. So you still have to prepare a sum of money for ""repair""",btohqsg
Yes. First time experience dealing with pre owned car.,btohqsg
For peace of mind  going to arrange Ppi then,btohqsg
One year old car  one of my friend said  don't waste money. Other said  better send to Ppi for peace of mind. Haha  problem lies with me  inexperience,btohqsg
unfortunately that is my profession but anyways,btohqsg
Haha. I feel ashamed to share that I am also auditor. But when comes dealing with car.. I have not much experience. 🥲,btohqsg
Nice to know we have two auditors here... At least,btohqsg
no wonder ur name is black coffee,btohqsg
What u all think about importing 1 Yr old model into sg. In particular .. rav4 phev. Plug in hybrid.Won't have local warranty tho.,btohqsg
Singapore don't sell plug in hybrid,btohqsg
Haha. Internal auditor already. Used to be from Blue color. Hehe,btohqsg
I feel plug in hybrid is a waste of $$$,btohqsg
Is it because maintenance and repair too expensive?,btohqsg
Whats e rationale of having a plug in hybrid,btohqsg
A normal hybrid is good enough,btohqsg
Not like u r gg to drive in electric mode for plug in hybrid,btohqsg
The only advantage is able to get parking lots near mall carpark entrances,btohqsg
Almost all ev parking lots r next to entrances,btohqsg
EH SHIT I ALSO FROM BLUE,btohqsg
From the KP  kao pei group,btohqsg
Hello sir.. u ok Liao ?,btohqsg
Anyone bought car under the sgcm warranty before? What was the conditions to maintain the warranty valid?,btohqsg
U have to service at their designated work shop pit and go,btohqsg
There is also 30 day cooling off period  meaning no claim within first 30 days,btohqsg
Huh means go back to the dealer ws ah? Forget it liao,btohqsg
When i bought my car  the dealer offer 1yr engine + gearbox. But in tht year must go their auth workshop for servicing,btohqsg
Ok la. I went for one time servicing. Normal charges lor,btohqsg
Thn transmission use back original then brake fluid use brembo,btohqsg
Drive past n forever no car kind,btohqsg
Then the shop u see like nothing stock up,btohqsg
At least not pump out frm the 🛢️,btohqsg
18kw batt. 60km full electric mode before engine cut in.,btohqsg
But direct import repairs and no warranty gotta think how.,btohqsg
Hybrid batt is 1.8Kw. Mild assist only,btohqsg
Their warranty ws is pit n go?,btohqsg
I thought it would be under the respective dealer's ws,btohqsg
Has 300 hp (6k rpm)and 227nm (3.2k rpm)5 s plus 0 to 100,btohqsg
But u are right. Pay much more. No warranty Sg how fast wanna go. Hybrid suah. Unless can convince borneo or PI to bring in and cover warranty,btohqsg
Next year hybrid ves rebate reduce from 20k to 5k 😭. Dunno why gov deadset on EV but not hybrids,btohqsg
hey  does anyone knows the deals/promo pricing for the VW warehouse sale? TIA!,btohqsg
How's the maintenance of a cat A merc? Very expensive?,btohqsg
Mercs not so easy spoil but when it does the bill quite hefty,btohqsg
I see most coe conti are mercs on the road. Also want to ask about this about the cost of maintenance,btohqsg
Coe mercs r built like a tank.,btohqsg
But when tank spoils  its gg to cost a bomb,btohqsg
The old E Class r solid,btohqsg
U drive VW . I tag u correct mah,btohqsg
I oso think so .. gearbox fear🤣,btohqsg
The 20k ves is locked in once u sign with dealer right.,btohqsg
Dealer quote u w the 20k in alrdy,btohqsg
If a person don't earn close to 10k a month   it's suicidal to buy a conti car,btohqsg
If earn close to 10k a month but buy Korean car  can?,btohqsg
No right or wrong. Earn 3k buy Korean car...also got such people around,btohqsg
Ultimately its the owner who will suffer if he buy a car which he hardly can afford.,btohqsg
Just go once and then change work shop lor,btohqsg
Today merc technician told me major servicing cost $2800. 🥲,btohqsg
Wow. This $2800 can change many mods 😂,btohqsg
If end at $1 u see next day leng kee road traffic jam non stop with long queues,btohqsg
Then these ppl tht Q will pay $100k,btohqsg
yea i meant  if somehow magically tomorrow end at $1 lol,btohqsg
But even if $1 also wont benefit u. Cos u nvr buy at the bidding,btohqsg
Most dealers dont sell u if u walk up to them w COE,btohqsg
U sign w dealer they bid for u,btohqsg
If u really heng  manage to secure $1 bid at the atm  at most pay a bit  more more to dealer,btohqsg
1 dollar coe good if drive till 10yr ba  if gonna change car  you're just delaying the hike?,btohqsg
then like that whats the point of bidding urself,btohqsg
well pretty much guaranteed profit lor when changing car,btohqsg
What they charge amounting to 2.8k?,btohqsg
I.e. if dun intend to buy car,btohqsg
