Stand chart card excludes. Most card (if not all) excludeIdk what exclusion list you’re looking at but it clearly says bill payments are not qualifying spend here,btohqsg
Hmm I saw that in SingSaver side but not MoneySmart side. Means technically MS side can do?,btohqsg
Qn: Once you hit $102 000 (Ordinary + Additional Wage) of annual net income a year  will you still be allowed to VCMA and RSTU?,btohqsg
For Citi reward  how see that transaction is indeed online?,btohqsg
It depends how you use/redeem the miles. If you use it to pay your CC bills  it’s about 2.5%. And about 3% if you buy voucher in some of the app. If you want to know how much does your mile worth for travel. You need to find that air ticket price in cash and compare it with redeem with miles. Different country and seat are different. Need to do a little bit of maths to get it,btohqsg

I think a lot people been using amaze and CRMC because we can bring the card ovs to use and still earn points. Then we supplement it with HCBS revo.The only benefit of WWMC for most people is the higher spending limit. However the points there has shorter expiry date.That why most people would just get CRMC and HSBC as a combo if they don’t spend more than 1k,btohqsg
Thanks Trazora  can I assume it is the same for UOB EVOL too?,btohqsg
