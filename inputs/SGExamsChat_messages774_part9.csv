So tm geog department has how many chers,btohqsg
For me it’s 2 chers for both batches,btohqsg
I thought TM geog dept is small,btohqsg
And doesn’t help that the only decent geog Cher left is probably retiring soon,btohqsg
Cuz the chers follow all the way from j1 to 2 by right,btohqsg
It’s normal for schs to have only around 3 geog chers,btohqsg
Acjc for h1 history one batch only has one Cher,btohqsg
Whereas h2 get 2 Cher’s per batch,btohqsg
Idk for h1 but h2 should be 40-50,btohqsg
