im failing my ippt can anyone give tips,btohqsg
yea i gets but it's how they perceive them la. like if you are able to look past the fact that they just got out of jc then sure wtv,btohqsg
I have seen it before tho,btohqsg
idk when you think of them as just out of jc  it's off. you think of them as uni freshie it's less weird,btohqsg
no i left the server then i got banned,btohqsg
Realistically if they really like each other eh,btohqsg

2.4 is the hardest train that the most,btohqsg
im a good runner but i suck in pushups,btohqsg
My pushup is 54 ah in 60sec,btohqsg
i personally know people that freshie year 1 dated a postdoc/phd (idk which),btohqsg
I mean tbh i just witnessed a y4 scoop up a y1 girl 2 days into ori so i guess ive seen all the weirdness there is,btohqsg
surprisingly none of our friend group really gave a shit,btohqsg
Same I relied on my running 10 min 17 seconds to get silver,btohqsg
Also the brain age matters lmao personally if your thinking is unorthodox it leaves u kinda alone in your age group liao,btohqsg
If youâ€™re skinny need to bulk and train push ups daily,btohqsg

Sometimes i dont feel my age at all,btohqsg
I think i might actually be a good person to workout with rn if u got nth going on in terms of strength and stamina,btohqsg
"i never do bc i'm like still going on campus like a ""student""",btohqsg
Yeah damn a lot of my year mates still have that JC sheltered mentality,btohqsg
So what you need to work on,btohqsg

They kena screwed when stars come,btohqsg
my run and sit up okok,btohqsg
Ya then js slowly build up core and arm strength and progress,btohqsg
Like in terms of maturity level  like how i perceive a situation and how i solve problems etc,btohqsg
And when any opportunities I legit had ppl be like no one told me,btohqsg
Minh i got like 2 options tbh,btohqsg
Never ever felt like mature enough to do that,btohqsg
Day by day you will improve,btohqsg
"i think when i fly overseas for conference and have to interact with all the academics as an ""equal""",btohqsg
Of course you cannot be lazy,btohqsg
u want relaxed approach or like the spartan method for increasing pushup,btohqsg
No shame on doing girl first,btohqsg

Find max pushup and do 10-20% of max every hr,btohqsg
Ippt is mental power and discipline,btohqsg
