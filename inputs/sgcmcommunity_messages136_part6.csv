The people come wash ur car mon to fri  $50 a month,btohqsg
not full on wash  like clean with water and wipe lor,btohqsg
2017-2019I paid only $40/mth.Now $50/mthMon/Tues/Thur/FriAnd not clean. Only 4 swipe. Left/right/front/rear. No roof.🤦‍♂,btohqsg
A deep clean takes abt an hr solo,btohqsg
If u go outside wash and they got like 5 people in msia,btohqsg
Is true not clean  their water recycle on many car anywayBut for me because I drive a lot  especially back when I did grab a lot  my car would always come back with alot of dirt  dust  mud  birdshit and water stain.Sooo for me quite worth la to just get rid of those things everyday,btohqsg
Much more value if you just jet your car then wipe,btohqsg
I’m don’t like washing my own car one LOL. I jet only rims or bird shit sometimes. Other than that  if I jet car they always leave water spot  not willing to get wet and sweaty to wipe the car,btohqsg
I mean if it’s a big sum then it’s different la  but $50 for a month / $10 per wash at petrol kiosk  is minuscule compared to the amount of money you spend on car or even food,btohqsg

Hi guys  would like to seek some advice here.I’ve bought a new Nissan Serena last week but my wife dislike the car alot. Any idea how do i minimize lost if i were to sell it or trade in now?,btohqsg
Should have brought wife to see the car together…. But now that it’s done  most you can do is probably direct sale or consignment at least you can list it to whatever you want. Rule78 boh bian really  just pay and take it as a lesson.Else just convince your wife arh  car she pay one meh  she willing to absorb cost meh. End of day is Point ABA,btohqsg
Should buy anti thief lug nut?,btohqsg
I won't be surprised got traders trade coe like stock market. Govt should give 1 mth for traders to register coe to a car after every bid  otherwise pour back to the coe pool  instead of 6mths.,btohqsg
Wa bro the moment car leaves dealership  it depreciates like mad,btohqsg
This is why sometimes buy car better bring wifey along,btohqsg
If ur passenger princess dont like gg,btohqsg
Ur gna hear her niam niam niam away as long as she sits in the car,btohqsg
Lol its quite silly to sell the car within a month of buying just because someone in the family dun like the car... there's grab  shariot etc but seriously  she should learn to like the car. Unless you need to burn money.,btohqsg
I wud like to say buy car easy. Sell at a gooood price difficult,btohqsg
