"Can I ask for $$ inside UOB  after transfering the $$ out to other banks..How long it will take for the $$ back to UOB and they will  considered as ""Fresh Funds"" ?",btohqsg
not sure if this is about the cny offer from uob. If i'm not mistaken  they also will look at your MAB to determine its freshness. you can refer back to the clause i recall seeing that part..,btohqsg
It has always been based on promo t&c on how they define it.,btohqsg
Hi! Can I ask for UOB one account  if I transfer $1600 from OCBC to UOB account every month  will I get the interest?,btohqsg
is this really stackable? i.e use this linkhttps://hmsg.link/sgwebulland fulfill the requirements?,btohqsg
then you will get $458 + 400 usd of tesla shares?,btohqsg
HSBC  AMEX   CIMB   OCBC  if not can consider simlim   i believe the price should be better than aftershock,btohqsg
wah sounds too good to be true... sir just confirm use this link:https://hmsg.link/sgwebullto sign up with WEBULL - fund 10000 USD (at 1 SGD = 0.7297 i.e. 13705 SGD) and hold for 2 months  get $458 via paynow and USD 400 of tesla shares . gamsahamnida,btohqsg
Correct  it's listed on SingSaver official,btohqsg
Thank you sir.. saw it! but then instead of clicking apply now on the singsaver website   i can also use this link:https://hmsg.link/sgwebull  so that I can support you.. its the same right?,btohqsg
Can the USD 10k be put in money bull?,btohqsg
i think so long as your holdings maintain at 10000 USD can already... as with other promotions. I.e. if you bought shares the share price drops and your assets drop to less than 10000 USD then you will not be eligible anymore,btohqsg
Hi all if I check out a bakery shop online  but payment is via PayPal will I earn 4mpd for dbs world women card?,btohqsg
depends if personal paypal or business paypal account,btohqsg
If no  does amaze +CRMC be another alternative?,btohqsg
personal paypal account not treated as eligible cc spend  does not have mcc,btohqsg
Can check how to calculate to see if worthwhile or not?,btohqsg
you can't because future FX rate cannot be predicted accurately,btohqsg
For illustration purpose  FX spread 0.25% one way  two ways = 0.5%. Thats 0.5% off your returns (have not even annualized it yet),btohqsg
Hi  for amex TCB sign up bonus with singsaver- will paying road tax count as eligible spend?,btohqsg
Hi! Wondering if anyone tried convert Citi points to Kris+ using this promo and if it’s possible to convert to krisflyer after to maximise the miles? :)Thank you,btohqsg
yes you can.. but it is net loss still,btohqsg
Ooo! Why do u say so? :),btohqsg
15% cut in miles then they give 8% back so nett around 8.2% loss in miles. Good thing is no transfer fees.,btohqsg
hello  if I link the DBS Woman’s World Card to Atome  will i still receive 4mpd?,btohqsg
I saw there is Principal: Ssslay Into Prosperity Campaign 8.88% pa promotion for investment in TnG apps under GoInvest with min RM10 000. Anybody take part the promo? Any catch?,btohqsg
Yes  Atome MCC is 5999 and transaction is considered online.,btohqsg
