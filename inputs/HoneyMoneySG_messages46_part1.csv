U can go branch to terminate earmark but u will lose all rewards.,btohqsg

Income tax season. Watched Chris video couple of times.Dear gurus  what's the best option for this case? 200k taxes to pay  prepared cash to pay one shot.What is the best case to get something out of it?Seems like Citi pay all is 120k cap.Also if using credit card for such  does it mean the credit limit must be raised above the one off income tax payment via citi pay all?Thanks.,btohqsg
If requesting for credit limit increase (temporarily or permanently) fails you can just prepay the amount into your card,btohqsg
I think I can do that. Assuming 120k limit of citi pay all  am I right to say pay citi 2.2% then suck thumb that the cap earned is 120k yet transaction is 2.2% of 200k?,btohqsg
Sir  if you are paying $200K tax  I suggest you join ACCM to not miss out on the $80K,btohqsg
Sir  how to? Me noob....hehehe....and deadline near,btohqsg
200k income tax. Wow. At least $1m income per year.,btohqsg
Can share which bank and what card?,btohqsg
UOB and you will need to spend 6.5k so i skipping totally,btohqsg
120k = 2.2% citipayall80k = 1.75% cardup,btohqsg
why do u want to pay one shot? you can always set up giro and then intercept the payments before deduction.,btohqsg
Me noob lah. Past years always pay 1 shot. Never get anything out of it,btohqsg
I thought UOB has a condition indicated that you must have not cancelled your card within 6  months or 12 months?,btohqsg
I wouldnt be trying anymore. so yah,btohqsg
