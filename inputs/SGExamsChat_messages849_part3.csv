ok so basically my class organised a chalet i didnt go but then afterwards they said need to pay approx 55 sgd/person if you stayed overnight and 45sgd/person. the thing is they didnt mention beforehand the costs or the fact that ppl needed to pay. i feel like they should've said beforehand that ppl needed to pay and not saying feels unethicalcuz we are students in jc and probably dont have jobs so 55sgd is not a small amount   plus its not so much about the cost and more that they withheld the info that one has to pay for the chaleteven if it was js 5 dollars i felt like they should've given a headsup that going = you need to pay,btohqsg
$55 is quite a lot eh,btohqsg
if u didn't go  why u need to pay,btohqsg
What they gonna small claims court you?,btohqsg
i didnt go cuz i alr dont like my class but i just think its very unethical for them to do that,btohqsg
If it is $10 maybe can give or take,btohqsg
girl gonna get smalll claims tribunal court 101,btohqsg
whoever organised the chalet class outing should foot the bill,btohqsg
they r gonna escalate to the teachers lor,btohqsg
$55 for a jc student is insane,btohqsg
I just say no money lor,btohqsg
i mean i think its fine if they say beforehand need to pay but they didnt,btohqsg
if they had said upfront oh u need pay 55 then its okay a,btohqsg
Not like the teacher can do shit anyways call my parents they will fuck the teacher up over calling them for 55 dollars,btohqsg
If it is small like 10 and they nvr say shld be fine,btohqsg
cuz 55 is quite a lot,btohqsg
esp cuz jc students and nvr work,btohqsg
They might as well do a small clique gathering lmao,btohqsg
