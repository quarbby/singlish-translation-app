Some of you may have come across a video that is circulating online about a commuter with a bicycle on board a train.At around 7.10pm on 15 Dec  an SMRT staff tried to stop a male commuter with a non-foldable bicycle from entering the train at Woodlands station. The male commuter was uncooperative and forced his way into a north-bound train. The commuter subsequently transferred to a west-bound train at Jurong East station and exited at Pioneer station at about 7.50pm.We have since identified the commuter and made a police report.For the safety and comfort of all commuters  we would like to remind everyone to observe regulations when bringing foldable bicycles and personal mobility devices on board trains and buses.,btohqsg
