Hi car gurus here. I am planning on getting either a mazda 3 2017 or kia cerato 2018. Will be doing long distance drive from amk to tuas. Wondering which one will be a fun and more fuel efficient to drive?,btohqsg
I know nothing about cars  but the Mazda 3 I think is better,btohqsg
I heard Kia from 2018 have flawed features (eg. cruise control doesnâ€™t keep speed well  ride is a bit noisy  etc.),btohqsg
Ahh i see. Just wanna get some opinions here before i waste my money ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Just test drive both and see which makes you smile more,btohqsg
Bonus points if the dealer in the car with you asks you to slow down,btohqsg
He had an affair. Thatâ€™s why he changed car. His love changed..,btohqsg
The newer Ceratos are better  but if your options are a Maz3 or a Cerato...,btohqsg
i30 has more power but power is redundant in sg,btohqsg
But go test drive the cars at a dealer that has both!,btohqsg
Zoom in on the car you want then go find cheaper consignment or direct owner units,btohqsg
Cerato is the way to go,btohqsg
Both their fuel efficiency are similar right?,btohqsg
don't listen to the guy that says he has all 3 of BBA cars end up tell others to drive attrage because cheap,btohqsg
full of misleading information and nonsensical opinions,btohqsg
