CPIB probe: PM Lee says Transport Minister S Iswaran has been interdicted from duty with a reduced pay of S$8 500 until further notice.https://cna.asia/3QqozqHFollow our live blog:https://cna.asia/3QgD54mWatch:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUxY7wFLhwA,btohqsg
8.5k pay cut is peanuts to him,btohqsg
Very simple  12*8.5 = 102k. If minister is one of the people who qualify for assurance package assistance and payment xiasuey. So ofc give him the right monthly salary to exceed annual 100k limit,btohqsg
no leh i think he shldnt be paid for now,btohqsg
if its a private company and one of ur workers is suspected of stealing funds,btohqsg
i doubt theyll continue to be paid,btohqsg
got a feeling this iswaran case was a compromise,btohqsg
make me ps no reason leh,btohqsg
"O level Oral question: Is it a good strategy to go ""Hmmm  that's interesting  give me a moment to think about that"" and buy yourself a few seconds to think? Or will that cost you marks?",btohqsg
I know you can ask them to repeat the question too  especially question 3,btohqsg
Honestly  it’s damn obvious so I’d rather stay silent,btohqsg
they don’t mark u down for being silent for a few seconds,btohqsg
2 seconds is not as long as u feel when u are high on adrenaline and brain on overdrive,btohqsg
