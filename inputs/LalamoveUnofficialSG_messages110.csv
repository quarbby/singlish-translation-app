Just remember  as long as not your fault  don't need scared the customer. U have ur own rights.,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I more worry customer complaints n then lalamove penalty me. Cos I don't have a screen shot of initial order,btohqsg

They will get back to u very fast,btohqsg
They willl pay u 50% order $,btohqsg
Oh can do that? They will not penalize me n don't let me join back?,btohqsg
I see. Thank you thank you.,btohqsg
Ya lor.. the other day I took an order.. give me wrong postal code n it's at least 5km drive to another place .. then give delivery address to a multi storey car park. Need to ask what BLK again.. then when I reconfirm unit.   CS can tell me  u can find all the details in the order!... I m really..... Pissed...,btohqsg
Yes think u get $30 and the person u refer to sign up also get $30. I am not sure if the promo is still on. You may want to ask the CS,btohqsg
I like Atout cos they are always on time. Their customers are mostly atas.,btohqsg
beware of this order fking scammer,btohqsg
Ah yes I took once b4. Tot I reach early liao. Then see the long q. Their setup very lousy. Very slow distribute. 1st and last time,btohqsg
This type kiam gan. 6pm open put 545pm pickup. I got kena resto like that b4. But also got kena some resto can ready b4 opening time one.,btohqsg
Kena those pickup 6pm. Reach there they say kitchen open at 6pm🤷‍♂,btohqsg
Yes I remember. The job was Amici at Food Exchange Admiralty. Mine was worse as the staff could not find my order. Asked me to deliver another location which was not even in my app! First and last too for me too.,btohqsg
Think he may have been referring to marriot tang. The 1 I took was at marriot tang. Like what he said got alot of drivers queuing up very slow distribution etc,btohqsg
Oh I thought Marriott has always been efficient. Different drivers diff encounters and experiences. Good to share and we all learn and be aware of.,btohqsg
And marriott tang allow u to park @ front lobby. If i rmb correctly. Tat a good plus point.,btohqsg
I kena pickup timing 1 hour b4 their opening hour. Lan lan waited for nothing n pay parking.,btohqsg
Maybe for small number of orders. That time it was a super big bulk bah.,btohqsg
That day front also not enough space liao😂,btohqsg
Wah. This very jialat. I rem I kena b4 one pickup is 30mins b4 they open. Told me die die only can get the food when they open cos kitchen haven't start. I just msg cs inform them  call customer inform them food might be late cos of this. Then see got anytg to stack  then go pickup other job first 😂,btohqsg
Won't wait there for nothing. It's not the carpark  it's the time wasted  especially during peak period,btohqsg
Tat day i saw ppl park outside the road haha,btohqsg
Ya sometime when i left n wanted to be back @ 1hour. Den suddenly call me after 15min,btohqsg
This Edith patisserie recently alot of orders go thru llm. Ever since getz started using llm,btohqsg
There was once I took a super rescue job,btohqsg
Already 1 hr pass the supposed drop off time. The shop told me customer may b angry,btohqsg
They got call the customer liao say no driver. I pickup then call again,btohqsg
End up when I reach customer already bought another bday cake😂,btohqsg
Then told Edith say the platform they using always cannot get driver😂,btohqsg
Than when i was there. They die die say Cannot cook 1st. Need to wait till they open than can start work.,btohqsg
I see tdy more jobs than ytd wor,btohqsg
Oh Jason kena before haha keep asking maid pay money  owner of the house damn angry,btohqsg
hahaha ya yesterday he very angry,btohqsg
the fare today is ridiculously low,btohqsg
if we stay United not to accept any job  and wait for the price to rise.. I think llm also LL,btohqsg
but I know for sure there are cheapos,btohqsg
The base price hasn't changed for years. Its only the holidays that have increased fares.,btohqsg
The next holiday is HariRaya 10 July. So will be base fares for about 2 months  except maybe rainy weekends.,btohqsg
because lots of cheapos.. is because of their existence.... llm keep issuing low fare job,btohqsg
if everyone paused and don't accept the job.. u see llm will + $ or not lo,btohqsg
I driving bmw. so cannot anyhow accept job. only expensive food can sit my car hahahaha.,btohqsg
I only see 1 current order in system,btohqsg
Kena msia cs good. If u kena spore cs or india or Philippines 1. U know how smelly they are.,btohqsg
Cannot blame them. We won't know if they desperate for the income n need work mah. 1 main reason is less jobs. During covid alot of jobs  and less drivers cos maybe pple want lessen risk of exposure. So due to higher demand for drivers the jobs have ++$ very often.,btohqsg
Now more drivers n less jobs cos open up  so fares no have +$ so low lor,btohqsg
true. but if we keep accepting low fare job also not good in the long run. llm will cheat us with fare  charging customer high fee but dispatch out low fare for rider/driver,btohqsg
It's like what someone wrote just now. Base fare etc still the same. Just that less +$ etc,btohqsg
The main difference is again  there's much lesser jobs now. Lower supply of jobs but so much more drivers. The customer is charged what we see on the job app. I have tried out the llm app for users b4.,btohqsg
anyway  anyone here tried Amazon flex before?,btohqsg
Pasir ris drive to Havelock then to tamp,btohqsg
I also only did 2 deliveries today cos all is too far.,btohqsg
Dear friends. Need adviceYesterday i took a lala job.. go 老火汤，collect n deliver. $16 after deduction.Arrive on time  but food already took by someone. Restaurants call the person who collected food  fake Tel no.In the end restaurant re cook the food. I inform lala  wait 45 mins  pay car park. Lalamove said will re adjust the charges n pay me according. They will send me revised fee.Today  3 CS call ask the same question n now they deduct the $16 earn n claim isfakeorder .So end up. I free labor  pay parking  deliver n no money earn.What can I do to get CS to take fast action?,btohqsg
Got take pic? Sometimes take just in case since know they smelly pattern,btohqsg
No picture taken at that time.   CS now claim restaurant never agreed the food already taken by other ppl,btohqsg
😭😭😭 ok. So upset . When communicating with CS last night they agreed to pay additional surcharge. Today call me 3 times ask me same question  repeated n they tell me to check my order detail. Now  they just deducted my money.N put fake order..How to fake order when I physically go collect n deliver to customer.. not like $160... Only trying to make $16... Woodlands to Admirity order only...So frustrating,btohqsg
Wow  this is horrible. Anyway the story by the resto so rubbish. If it's llm driver who took the order  the tel number shldnt be fake. Cos we all need to give a contact number b4 we start working. And all restos will check the order number n stuff b4 giving out the food. This sounds like resto trying to bluff. Maybe 4got to prepare so tell a cok story. Then if tell u food taken liao but tell llm nvr say food taken  then its obviously the resto trying to cheat lah. U tell me got which driver will risk getting suspend/ban or police case for fraud over a $16 job order? Who will give a fake number in their acct or to the resto  when name ic vehicle number has to be given to the delivery platform?,btohqsg
Llm on their part of cos will listen to the resto  cos u have no photo or evidence. Just my advice  nxt time got such situation where u have to wait for them to cook again  u call the recipient. Tell them what happen. Say food will be late. Sms them also as proof. Then when food ready  u sms them again say food ready n u will be sending over. Then once delivered  u send them msg again say food has been delivered. All this is proof u did send,btohqsg
But even then  don't their riders etc need to provide their details to the platform? And will they be so stupid to lose their jobs over 1 delivery,btohqsg
I'm sure the recipient will remember this order  cos it was obviously late for the stated time as they needed to prepare the food again,btohqsg
Ya... Actually got call customer  they call restaurant n ask restaurant to cook again... So customer aware of problem. Just today restaurant refused to admit their food mis managed n now become problem,btohqsg
From what I read  it's the resto now saying ur order is fake order? Or llm saying its fake order,btohqsg
U got call recipient that day?,btohqsg
This time is resto playing punk,btohqsg
Don't know what Restaurant tell CS....my initial payment deducted n n remark is False order deduction... Got such term to deduct my money??,btohqsg
False order deduction means the job wasn't done due to double order or anytg  but was still credited to acct so they deduct it back,btohqsg
Then u have the call log,btohqsg
U can tell cs u called the customer to inform them the food would be late cos resto screw up,btohqsg
Tell cs u have call log,btohqsg
Wa Lou i delivered the food ley...,btohqsg
That u actually did service recovery by letting customer know the situation n then delivered the food. Why r u getting the money deducted for false order deduction,btohqsg
They cut off my line 3 times today... So angry.. already very few order yesterday..  only manage to take 2.. one got cancel n 2nd one give me problem.,btohqsg
If cs still persist n say its the resto say no such thing happen  then follow Alex advice n call the resto n tell them they play punk issit. Do the job for them liao then they want to siam payment,btohqsg
Haiz... Like need to be  大哥 to hung them then can get my money back..😂,btohqsg
But there's 1 thing to clarify also. The supposedly fake number driver who took the food. Maybe he got send the food n swipe complete job. Then got the money liao. Then they treat urs as duplicate order.,btohqsg
But if that's the case then it's still the resto own fault. Who ask them do another 1 n ask u send. Anyway this case so much grey area  so can't give u exact advise also.,btohqsg
The Tel number written on the collection log is fake number .. cannot get thru one. If food deliver? To who? He eat himself cos customer never received food ley,btohqsg
They can see who the driver is on their own system actually n the details,btohqsg
Don't really need write the number,btohqsg
Maybe customer receive liao then pretend want another portion😂,btohqsg
Yah it's resto fault. N they trying siam payment,btohqsg
Got driver so desperate to eat free meal Meh. Can lose job 1 leh,btohqsg
This case like going to court to fight. But except for my $16..😂,btohqsg
老火汤 not all few hundred or thousand dollar food wor,btohqsg
That's y I don't really believe the resto story,btohqsg
Yes.   Agreed. Restaurant did not check properly n LLM CS sucks at their services,btohqsg
Maybe resto gave the driver wrong order,btohqsg
Then own fault don't want admit,btohqsg
Then driver say its their fault don't want bring the food back etc,btohqsg
And always keep the screenshot for at least 2 mths,btohqsg
Cos sometimes they always very long tome later then suddenly ka jiao u,btohqsg
Will kena more than 1 mth later also,btohqsg
Actually not about $16 is about the treatment n how CS handle the whole thing,btohqsg
Causeway point . The management is bad.. I ask 3 times for the order before they can identified it was already taken by someone else,btohqsg
Yes.   N they cannot find .. the order.. ask different staffs also,btohqsg
Yesterday i have also had an issue with a hotel  they are usually very punctual but yesterday miss a steak. JOb started at 1530 but i went in 1515  say chef miss an item  say can wait till 1545. ok la 15 min  still i live chat w CS  tell them issue. Knn then wait till 1600 then out. Happen CS also call.

The gogox price need deduct commission?,btohqsg
But they will show how much is the commission at the page,btohqsg
? As in deposit? Like llm,btohqsg
Oh don't need specially go check,btohqsg
Not good. They give u a bulk job to be completed in 2 to 4 hours (many deliveries and minimum block is 2 hours) but u definitely need more than 2 to hours to complete all the deliveries. Once u finish  then only u can take new jobs. To and fro to collection point at Toh Guan is wasting time. Any unsuccessful delivery must return to collection point.,btohqsg
I think the rate is little higher these days.,btohqsg
And I think also must fight for the job 1 right?,btohqsg
When the jobs are released mostly are gone in split seconds. Those that are not taken are not so good jobs.,btohqsg
Yup this is wat I heard from my friend who does it. Most of them have an app or something that auto fight for jobs or something,btohqsg

Getting the lalakit for car/mpv will not give you priority,btohqsg
I have the lalabag also dont have,btohqsg
My max is 12 order in a day,btohqsg
Only getting sticker will hv priority,btohqsg

Does gogox has more order than lala  ,btohqsg
Ya saw a few on the road,btohqsg

Die die have to fulfill. Make few trips to send,btohqsg
2 hours job . Drops location ranging from 4 to 9 .,btohqsg
Sometime   1 location might have multiple order.,btohqsg
I ever delivered 8 cartons of 1 litre mineral water to 1 location,btohqsg
So $30 per hour job not so easy,btohqsg
I encounter many newbies giving up after 1st attempt on amzn,btohqsg
That's y got good n bad,btohqsg

In the end its all abt what suits u n what u want,btohqsg
4hrs May be 24-28 dropping locations,btohqsg
Is there any load limits??In LALAMOVE…for a car order it must be overall 20kgms only irrespective of number of drops..Let’s say if they assigned 10 droppings…also overall weight 20kgms only,btohqsg
Is there any total overall weight limits in Amazon??,btohqsg
Don't think got. Load until no space I heard. But I could b wrong,btohqsg
How come nowadays less orders at LALAMOVE…My phone almost silent always without triggering orders??,btohqsg

As far as what I know  you need to load all parcels assigned to you. If the load is too much for your car  you can inform the team leader and he will survey the load in your car. If really too much  he will take back the balance.,btohqsg
Not necessary must complete within 4hrs. You can deliver The parcels till 10pm (iirc) but the balance of the time it’s on your own.,btohqsg
So far  in the recent 4.5hrs job  I can finished them by 3 to 4hrs time. ( approximately 22 to 26 drops ),btohqsg
For the 2hrs job at Toh guan yes ( becuz it’s all groceries) . For benoi no need ( cuz mainly all parcels and envelopes),btohqsg
I even do benoi and lala together. 😂,btohqsg
As long as parcels are delivered by 10pm .,btohqsg

Hi guys ! Anyone Kena user who said pay by Paynow after job and end up Kena run payment before ? Did a Kovan Sentosa job to deliver a cake . Send to hotel n concierge took over cake to pass to customer who has booked the hotel villa for birthday celebration. I told the concierge I was not paid yet and she went to check for me .Concierge came back and told me customer said hv to check first . Next thing I received a phone call and the man on the phone asked me why I ask payment from his client . I said I don’t know who is the real client as Lalamove job description showing collect cash from baker . Baker said collect at Sentosa .Anyway the guy promised to pay n after many hrs also no pay . Next day I contacted lala CS and he said he will pay . Again nothing . After a few more times   CS contacted m he kept promising to pay   said he in ambulance   etc and also no pay . I also msg him again yesterday n told him I will be making police report against him and he finally said that he already paid to lala . I asked for proof he did not show .Again I contacted CS on live chat n was told he still did not pay ! 😡😡😡,btohqsg
Now CS also advise me to report police for this case .,btohqsg
Job was $35.70 and after contacting Lala CS many times they made me fill up a form and finally reimbursed me $5.45 …. Not even enough for my fuel let alone my time all wasted .,btohqsg
Any advise or sharing how to deal with this type of situation will be welcome . Thanks all in advance!,btohqsg
same thing happened to me...Lalamove just regretted for the negative experience...but I lost $56.90 and they returned back the commission taken...spoken to LLM cS ...how are you going to stop this in the future because this kind of people going to makan LLM drivers money but they said we blocked this number to do booking,btohqsg
do you think lodging police report can help to recover money??,btohqsg
this guy booked this order was83232808...this was his mobile number...he said payment shall be through paynow upon job completion...you just notify me once job completed...the job was done on 07 May 2022 and till to date no response...this guy said to LLM already deducted $56.90 from my wallet,btohqsg
Lalamove just regret for this case onlybutI spent my time about 2hrs...plus petrol...car wear & tear etc etc can't spare for this guy to make money using me...very sad this kind of things happening,btohqsg
on this day I did only one job and the money/effortwas makan by someone.....ridiculous,btohqsg
it makes me more scary people's are start to roe money like this...don't know which platform is better...this was the most bitter experience,btohqsg
If a few more ppl keep reporting to police on the same guys. Police will or may take action against him,btohqsg
kind request to all. Suppose in LLM.  if you happen to see the cash order with this mobile number83232808please don't take...sure he will makan your money and your effort...I already kena....lost my weekend/family time/efforts etc etc,btohqsg
I wonder for other delivery platforms are there such problems with cash orders? If so how do they handle?,btohqsg
raised the same question to LLM CS..no proper response from them...there is no guarantee for the money to driver,btohqsg
I guess this guy operating from his residence at Yishun...Blk 266 Yishun St 22.  #10-260,btohqsg
Oh I bought cake from this store before for my daughter's birthday,btohqsg
kind request to all. Suppose in LLM.  if you happen to see the cash order with this mobile number83232808& Yishun...Blk 266 Yishun St 22.  #10-260 address please don't take...sure he will makan your money and your effort...I already kena....lost my weekend/family time/efforts etc etc,btohqsg
he don't want to show me,btohqsg
u can't imaging this kind of people...how would they react...they will form up another story,btohqsg
I don't know what kind of arrangement with Client & LLM for money...I guess LLM might have collected deposit from their Client like they collected $75 from driver...that deposit may be called wallet...don't know,btohqsg
I just want other driver to be caution with this guy in the future,btohqsg
After that do go police report,btohqsg
Since you had all his address details,btohqsg
Just record down whatever LLM staff say and the guy say,btohqsg
LLM they are able to should the record if the police come down,btohqsg
it was a cash order...collect cash while collecting goods...,btohqsg
Den you should get the cash before off from his place,btohqsg
Wah I scared of cash order become of ppl like this,btohqsg
On a separate note  sometimes the job order u see the credit order logo  but then u see a cash order logo also. For such orders is cash or credit ah? I see such orders I nvr take also😂,btohqsg
I took beforeShop owner says Paynow will be done after. Say to check account after delivery.Which is funny as they think is auto and they don’t have our Paynow number.The client contact don’t pick up calls  but 3-4 hours after delivery I WhatsApp themI think the shop owner shouldn’t use like third party delivery agent like this.,btohqsg
If it’s a shop why need to Paynow after delivery. Doesn’t make any difference.If personal adhoc or individual can understand use cash but if shop the orders usually collect on the spot during collection,btohqsg
No show means fake de  usually they will show even before you question them for it,btohqsg
yeah..I realize that..need to lodge police report on this,btohqsg
Oh this is exactly the same bakery - Joanna’s oven that I was supposed to collect cash from but they told me to collect from Sentosa side which is their client . When I asked the concierge  she said she will check with the guest and later the guy called and said why u collect payment  from my client ? So now I think the scum bag shd be the bakery’s owner !!! 😡😡,btohqsg
I am going to go down to the bakery . Anyone Kena from them wanna go together ? Then we call for police there .,btohqsg
The phone number is not same tho,btohqsg
Not the hotel guest taht cheated . Shd be the bakery .,btohqsg
U go down to the bakery and clarify   show them the order on lalamove and the chat messages.Don’t get too worked upTry to find out how to get the money back more important,btohqsg
Yes that is what I intend to do . Not worked up . Just don’t like people to cheat others … it is just so wrong . This is my second time . First time also said after job will Paynow . Did not pay after that and even after few messages and calls . Finally LL CS called her and she paid up . Only $19+ and driving Audi also want to cheat people . I told her next time don’t do things to people if she does not want people to do to her ( cheat) and I will lodge police report with her car license plate for cheating ( she passed food to me outside condo from her car so I saw her car ) .,btohqsg
Yes that is why I asked for payment from them and they said no pls collect at Sentosa .,btohqsg
put a nice Google Review on their shop and attach the screenshots with a 1 star review.,btohqsg
Sounds like a fun and brilliant idea lol . Can we all do it . There are few thousands of us here . If we are United   we can beat the cheaters and teach them a lesson . When too many 1 stars reviews   no customers =less lala jobs from them and less of us will be cheated 😜,btohqsg
