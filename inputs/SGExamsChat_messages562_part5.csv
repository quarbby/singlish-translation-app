But I haven't touch isit worth,btohqsg
Okay but my chem is like,btohqsg
I can physical chem damn well,btohqsg
60-80percentile for my batch is C,btohqsg
We had 21 As for prelims,btohqsg
Ej papers aren't rly difficult but the marking is super strict,btohqsg
So they catch for alot of small things,btohqsg
Like I think the electro sub,btohqsg
My + was 1cm outside of the like circle,btohqsg
I still have it with me,btohqsg
I mean its a far critique so,btohqsg
But ya is all the small small stuff like this,btohqsg
"I wrote ""regardless of"" instead of ""if"" didn't change the meaning of the sentence but wrong",btohqsg
Got given 0 for language for gp essay,btohqsg
Bad? Not cuz people don't do well but cuz the marking is damn funny,btohqsg
Like some students will always get A cuz they'll mark slacker,btohqsg
Got one physics paper I think everyone wrote the same answer but this student sucked up to the cher,btohqsg
He got given full credit everyone else 0,btohqsg
Then the cher try justify themselves give damn stupid reason,btohqsg
Say handwriting cannot read never write on the line etc etc,btohqsg
But I think that was just my batch,btohqsg
bruh wth happend to reddit?looks like the web version,btohqsg
You think they will test Fertilizer neutralize ground thing?,btohqsg
calcium hydroxide (limewater)   calcium carbonate (limestone),btohqsg
pls pull down the bell curve yall,btohqsg
i lazy type the entire thing out LOL LOL,btohqsg
To be fair  one can be lazy and knowledgeable at the same time. I don't like that exams supposedly test knowledge but in reality it's about the ability to memorise random trivia.Like  what's the composition of nitrogen in air? If you asked me I'd say 70 something%. It's the 2020s  we can look it up. (Yeah  ik  it's N2 79% and O2 21%. I'll forget that after the exams end tyvm).Anyway I just have strong feelings about how this exam is such a big deal in our society but it's so flawed in design.,btohqsg
Both lazy and hardworking are relative.I have seen students who said they were very hardworking and studied very hard  but still failed their exams.When probed deeper  their hardworking referred to only starting to study just 2 days before a major EOY exams  after not doing anything for the entire year. Hardworking because entire 2 days was devoted to studying (out of the whole year).,btohqsg
Btw  this is not impossible at the O level. My O level time  I had a friend who gave up on Geography during the O level revision  though he studied throughout the year.He only started studying for Georg the evening before the paper and he came out A1.However  this is going to be near impossible for Maths and Science subjects.,btohqsg
I'd argue some people just aren't cut out for academics as we have it today. I don't understand why facts are more important to academia than teaching and learning concepts and discovering new things.I'm doing the exams because I want the certificate  but I feel like I've barely learnt anything other than how to answer exam questions the entire year.It feels hard to find the point in doing that when you're supposedly meant to be learning. I can relate to those who gave up on the exams  especially since I dropped out once.Of course I've worked hard this year  but that's because I want to get it over and done with already.,btohqsg
Ok but tbh geog if udk how to phrase the ans also no matter how much cramming u do also gg,btohqsg
It almost feels like we put undue emphasis on exams because we need to prove our country's educational superiority on the world stage  lolAnyway  sorry for the rant  but I have to disagree that exams prove or disprove a person's ability to learn.,btohqsg
My geog stopped at S2  so I can't tell also,btohqsg
Yeah. I know that personally. I've been interested in programming since forever and taught myself so much. But I probably won't ever get a job as a programmer in Singapore because I'm dumb on paper.,btohqsg
yea i only realised I had to really really study to do well from A levels personally,btohqsg
last min in uni kinda worked tho somehow,btohqsg
Lazy how to get A1  but lazy means cannot learn meh,btohqsg
like education showing your ability to learn is a uni thing,btohqsg
bc that's what a lot of companies look at with your degree,btohqsg
but before uni it's all about just getting the credentials to get admission,btohqsg
No diploma no degree submit job application also auto reject lol,btohqsg
yea you'd want some sort of diploma/degree to just get past arbitrary filters but programming is one of the pathways that don't require you to actually have super related majors,btohqsg
and at the end of the day  that arbitrary filter is needed bc the number of people that can fill the role you're looking for is very high,btohqsg
Sian not like the economy is doing great so might as well tahan,btohqsg
like unless your portfolio is so impressive  more than likely many people can do it at the same level as you and have a degree,btohqsg
"I F9 ed my Chem and Physics from Sec 1-5...prelims had a 32/100 and a 35 or 37/100Last 3 weeks before combined science o levels  i put in the ""Hardwork"" and scored a C6 for both for o levels.I know i can do better myself..but at the same time i constantly question that need. Whether its because i've been influenced by peers that did minimal and achieve better results or whether its peers that did alot but achieved less than ideal results...I cant balance..",btohqsg
That is actually a statement with truth..our ministers have conveyed the exact same idea before,btohqsg
the sentiments about exams and stuff has been there forever  but no one has a better solution,btohqsg
all they've done is try to reshape exams to be seen less that way  but let's be real it's the same shit,btohqsg
I think I'll do better in working world tbh,btohqsg
