in japan their STI all 2.0,btohqsg
I like all of them la,btohqsg
The only reason why i like the levorg,btohqsg
Hatch easy to put things in the boot,btohqsg
Even if no more seats for a person  can put in the boot,btohqsg
Which is why i dont like hatch. The things in the boot is still in your cabin,btohqsg
technically sedan boot is still in your cabin  but it's more isolated,btohqsg
I dont like to see in rear view mirror thencan see my boot stuff,btohqsg
makes me feel like i driving lorry,btohqsg
I don't like to see ppl in my rear view mirror,btohqsg
Especially idiots who sit in the middle,btohqsg
I driving a mini van aka hatchback...but no issues with downforce at 170kmph...not sure wad speed u usually going atüòÇ,btohqsg
that's why you need a miata,btohqsg
2.0 can hold more hp n boost,btohqsg

Do you guys have walkies? Like when drive together can talk,btohqsg
I think end of the day..daily shld be reliable and comfortableüòÅ,btohqsg
The baofeng is amazing... I could use it to scan for the frequency my other walkie is using,btohqsg
next time can have dedicated channel or frequency,btohqsg
But frequency range wise not that far,btohqsg
He photographer mah so to communicate for rolling shots panic shots all he will use it,btohqsg
i had to scan the frequency then the dcs to get it to work with my other walkie,btohqsg

then must sit down one day with you to figure out your frequency,btohqsg
Miata can daily just dont get a soft top ‚Äî,btohqsg
