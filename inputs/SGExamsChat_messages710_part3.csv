We have 30 yrs olds in the main intake..we have overseas uni students in our poly...we have ppl that spend 5-6 yrs in the main intake,btohqsg
what the fuck are 30 year olds doing in poly,btohqsg
go ns..work abit then come poly join main intake,btohqsg
switch career and up skill is it ?,btohqsg
only way to get removed from rp is failing 2 modules in 2 sems or 1 module in 3 sem,btohqsg
5-6 years can get masters in uni bud,btohqsg
and im not a poly student,btohqsg
maybe..but join the main intake..not the part time diploma/part time study,btohqsg
fellow j1 here   do y'all have any regrets choosing jc ?,btohqsg
Actually how come all of a sudden you'd decide to pop back here,btohqsg
üíÄoh yea did i mention..he was reaccepted back into rp..like a few months later i could have sworn i saw him,btohqsg
I always wanted to do A Levels,btohqsg
‚Äúdecided to check on things‚Äù thts what he said,btohqsg
üò≠üò≠üò≠ i got nett 6 sent to ej,btohqsg
main discord servers died..so finding another place to socialise,btohqsg
maybe get some irl socialization instead of tele,btohqsg
the bottom line is anybody that wants to go rp..all they have to rmbis.youcan go any other poly  go through y1/y2 decide you cant sustain...come rp  you will have the most chill environment in the world,btohqsg
I'm glad I'm able to take As in due time,btohqsg
and how many rp students make it to uni? doesn't need to be the big 3,btohqsg
the poly showed us the acceptance scores for sutd and suss a yr or two back from students that attended rp..it was 3.4/3.5,btohqsg
also i heard that ib is better than a's for overseas uni? i wonder why,btohqsg
maybe cuz the word ‚Äúinternational‚Äù is inside,btohqsg
A is more of to get into sg university,btohqsg
tbh i feel like ppl in rp slackers,btohqsg
no wonder my parents wanted me to study hard so that i can go to a better school  where students are more likely to be studious üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
cuz moe decided to send me there,btohqsg
simillar to the other poly's from what i heard  because uni acceptance is not based off school,btohqsg
u can slack while other ppl is studios lmao,btohqsg
but if you just want to slack back..do what is needed and nothing more. just want a easy poly life and still get a decent gpa of 3.0...go rp,btohqsg
i honestly have a weird perception of studiousness. essentially just someone who studies really hard i ºd say. idk if i would call myself studious  but probably half-half  compared to my peers.,btohqsg
shldve went to sa/ac to party and cheat lol,btohqsg
outliers as in studios or slackers?,btohqsg
the exams/test in rp..60-70% of the qns been recycled across cohorts,btohqsg
"the faci's even told me that ""what makes you think the faci's will find the time to rethink of qns""",btohqsg
an actual blessing if the brits did this for a's,btohqsg
but how to be studious and end up in rp,btohqsg
can be chill anywhere if u dont give a shit abt ur work,btohqsg
the thing is even if you slack in rp..you will still end up in a class with 3.5-3.8gpa ppl,btohqsg
maybe they finally woke up when they r in rp,btohqsg
dont listen to him  he too chill until he got less then 2 gpa,btohqsg
there are 4.0s in every school,btohqsg
my gpa in y1 sem 2 was 1.5  my teamate was a 3.8,btohqsg
bruh im getting A's and B's now,btohqsg
huh so u jump frm 1.5 to 4.0???,btohqsg
if u get A n B i sign on WOSpec now,btohqsg
no lah..but i think at least a high 2. something,btohqsg
even in ite is hard to pull up gpa after fking up sem 1,btohqsg
still can pull up to 3+,btohqsg
idk what gpa this results yield,btohqsg
C and D... i would cry if i got those for my promos,btohqsg
