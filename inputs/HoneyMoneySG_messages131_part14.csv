Hello all - sorry a bit of a noob question..Thinking of pairing dbs vantage with cardup - I understand only rental transactions will count towards the initial qualifying spend of $4k within 30days. Does this also apply to the 60k spend in one year for the following year waiver ?,btohqsg
Other cardup trnx will qualify for 60k  not only rentalz,btohqsg
Ah ok..cos I looked at the exclusion list and it has things like school fees or car/housing loan repayments so didnâ€™t think they would be eligible for the 60k yearly spend,btohqsg
Most of cardup trnx will be 7399 so eligible for 60k spend but not welcome bonus. Cardup rental has different mcc so eligible for both 60k and welcome bonus.,btohqsg
Hi all  another noob question. New to the Kris+ with credit card combo. Can I ask  if I wanna use my Citi Rewards MC via Kris+  do I choose Amaze (linked to CRMC) or the CRMC itself on Google Pay to get Kris+ miles and Citi Rewards 4mpd points? (Assuming MCC qualifies),btohqsg
Crmc explicitly excludes apple/google pay so don't even add thar card there. Pair crmc with amaze for Kris+ to circumvent it.,btohqsg
is amex platinum card worth applying for given $1.7k card fee? new to credit cards. been using miles card all along,btohqsg
Hi all! Not sure if I can ask about home loan here Iâ€™m looking for Hdb resale recently and banks are offering fix 2 years at 2.85% but after that will be SORA +0.5% = 4.04% with the rate now.My question is  what if SORA after two years fixed rate is still very high like now? What are the options for new to save on interest? If I refinance  will there be any hidden cost to watch out for?,btohqsg
Need to consider whether to keep status quo/reprice/refinance later  reprice with same bank incur around $800 fees if refinance with another bank around $2000 legal/valuation fees,btohqsg
You need to check how long is the loan locked in period n clawback period.,btohqsg
Does anyone know how is krisflyer miles compared to heymax miles?,btohqsg

Fees with same bank can nego to waive also,btohqsg

"That card provides ""benefits""  lots of vouchers  status match  etc. you see yourself if those things are worth 1.7k for u",btohqsg
Anyone can access Ocbc Rewards page?,btohqsg

Hello can I ask whats the best way to clock miles to buy iPhone?Is it linking citirewards with krispay on krishop?,btohqsg
i think it looks decent since 6 month tbills is now 3.10% p.a.no funny conditions.. just make sure you start it on 1st of the month so avoid losing CPF interest,btohqsg
The iPhone cost less than $1000? Citi rewards max $1k only for 4mpd.,btohqsg
Assuming the transfer back to the Ordinary Account is completed in January 2025  these invested funds will earn CPF interest from February as CPF contributions  including refunds  start to earn interest only from the next month.In this case  the member is forgoing about 13 months or S$541.67 in interest if the S$20 000 was left in the CPF Ordinary Account  according to calculations done by Mr Wong. Further delays in the transfer  for example into February  could see the potential loss of another month of CPF interest.Then  there are one-time and recurring fees to be paid to the bank administering your CPF investment account. For example  DBS charges S$2.50 for each fixed deposit transaction and a quarterly service fee of S$2 â€“ excluding Goods and Services Tax.Taking these charges into account leaves the CPF member with a S$27 profit from the Maybank fixed deposit.It is still a net gain  so this comes down to whether people find it worthwhile for them to go to the trouble of signing up for the fixed deposit  said Mr Wong.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/cpf-fixed-deposit-ordinary-account-funds-4056851,btohqsg
ya but I don't think I would apply for another credit card since it might become loose miles if not accumulated. or are there better cards which gives 4mpd,btohqsg

which uob card? at store means wont have the extra 2000 additional miles from krisshop right,btohqsg
i mean at apple store using UOB VS,btohqsg
can you share the info of  extra 2000 additional miles from krisshop ?,btohqsg
Try explore using Amaze+CRMC or CRMC via Atome to pay KrisShop on 3 installment to maximize 4mpd.I have not tried before. You need to do research n take risk.,btohqsg
Very curious once u burst 1k on Citi rewards  what card are you planning to use for the rest of the month?,btohqsg

Question to business owners -Do you know of any good DPO outsourcing services and how much is it ?,btohqsg
If buy from krisshop  uob kf is pretty good uncapped 3 mpd,btohqsg
I plan to do this too  so ($1600 x 3 mpd) + ($1600 x 2 mpd) + 2000  is this calc correct for APPLE IPHONE 16 PRO MAX 256GB $1749?,btohqsg
($1745 x 3mpd ) + ($1604 x2mpd) + 2000. Krisshop will add tax to ur iphone during checkout. Uob kf 3mpd includes tax while krisshop 2mpd excludes tax,btohqsg
"""PREORDER your iPhone 16 Pro  expect shipment time of up to 3 to 4 weeks""",btohqsg
I think shopee got voucher discount 120+ for iphone,btohqsg
Krisshop is every $3 spend 2mpd right,btohqsg
is this direct go to our krisflyer miles?,btohqsg
