Tiger cannot do covered call  they don't recognise underlying shares as collateral,btohqsg
I'm not sure abt Moomoo or TDA or IBKR,btohqsg
Also to note : Saxo don't allow cash covered puts. Will dip into margin if you sell a naked put even if you have enough cash balance. I learnt the hard way  had to buy a put at a lower strike just to reduce the margin utilisation so I don't get margin called,btohqsg
Ibkr need 100k acc value to avoid the $10 monthly charge right?,btohqsg
Wow what is SMM doing? üò± 133/134,btohqsg
He can ah... But he rich,btohqsg
If I not wrong  below 100k usd acc value  the $10/mth fee can be deducted based on how much commission you paid,btohqsg
So if you have a stock that allows you to sell CCs weekly  may actually be more than $10/mth?,btohqsg
I'm not too clear on the fee structure,btohqsg
Hmmm will go read up on it,btohqsg
