Then I don’t want at all,btohqsg
because in order for it to go up,btohqsg
covid have to get worse and worse. eventually people gonna die to make it armageddon style for MT to fly sky high,btohqsg
there must be an extreme fear,btohqsg
Tomorrow TW side likely come down,btohqsg
form a doji at fibo level,btohqsg
william not charming enough for me to get in,btohqsg
My point of view is that they produce Ppe to protect healthcare workers which is a public good. The cases increase worldwide is certainly a benefit to them but they did not cause it.,btohqsg
Likely go below 1.1 tomorrow.TW cases drop today  tomorrow open at TW likely start throwing. When that side drop  SG also follow,btohqsg
No la…it’s like Friday situation. All pull out from other stock and dump to medical,btohqsg
Singapore hospital enforce more ppe now,btohqsg

This is easy for you to cook leh  Sam. 😂,btohqsg
haven't try to cook much fish yet,btohqsg

Ya lah. So must not overcook. Timing is impt,btohqsg
for fish   the margin of error is tighther than pork/chicken,btohqsg
anyway bbfa too poor  to buy fish,btohqsg
SY today 9-10 possible or not,btohqsg
wah shiok sia. i after bread gastric liao😅,btohqsg
next time canned tuna and baked beans,btohqsg
Maybe I misread your words but I see that cause of high case counts in the world is largely due to inept handling of the virus by the world leaders. MT produce PPE to protect those healthcare workers which even if MT disappears tomorrow  would still be needed. MT does not cause the new waves of viruses mutation around the world but is helping to reduce the case counts by protecting the healthcare workers and frontline workers. We all wish that covid19 disappears and MT's product are no longer needed. But the way the world works...it is likely to be in demand for quite some time.,btohqsg
nicer and easier on the weight  also,btohqsg
stock price != real world demands,btohqsg
once the initial hype dies out,btohqsg
who knows what willt he stock movement be,btohqsg
can i hire u as cook  1 day $1 hahah,btohqsg
hahaha   you give budget i can cook..,btohqsg
If want to lose weight don’t eat bread lah. Just eat tuna n baked beans,btohqsg
Got bbq taste one leh. Very Nice,btohqsg
no need lose weight la haha,btohqsg
3 dollar can cook one nice meal... but must commit to 5 days.. or else cannot take advantage to the economies of scale,btohqsg
😂😂😂 but health try to lose some lor 😔,btohqsg
Lose weight impossible.. Lose chor easier😁😁,btohqsg
just put your money into SGX,btohqsg
Which in a way the price now is quite fair for MT already given that you are factoring post covid sales,btohqsg
cause of surge is prob not the key here. my point being MT profits/share price is highly correlated with covid cases for reasons u mention. I have no wish for MT to disappear they clearly are essential in the fight against covid. just focusing on the correlation,btohqsg
