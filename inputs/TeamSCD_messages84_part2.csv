Hi guys   i just got my TPMSJust quick questionIf i screw the anti theft washer inDo i have to use the thing to unscrew it next time if i wanna pump?,btohqsg
Got a tool to unscrew n tighten one,btohqsg
Yes dont bother w the anti-theft..anyone has that same hex tool,btohqsg
if you didnt tighten it too much against the sensor  you probably still can unscrew the sensor without touching the washer haha,btohqsg
Yes. I kena b4 alr. Got others not from this group also kena,btohqsg
Yes  no need put the security screw... Troublesome to remove,btohqsg
Look up heng heng. Quality work.,btohqsg
I found them on Google too! Looks good,btohqsg
Within 10mins can pump all tyres  with this washer 10mins can pump 1 tyres,btohqsg
Wah headache leh the settingsMy device keeps beeping,btohqsg
My tyre 51 PSI maxI pump 48 PSIIt starts beeping at 46 onwards,btohqsg
ya because that's already very high,btohqsg
Imagine tyre puncture den cannot find the screwdriver... Siao liao,btohqsg
I don't understand page 4 - 7 LOL,btohqsg
didnt it come with a manual?,btohqsg
It did but no say page 1 is what page 2 is what kind,btohqsg
I just pump 48 for all 4Now the number no tally,btohqsg
i have the same tpms. so far i didnt touch the last few pages after PL. so cant help you there,btohqsg
but i would advise you to reduce your tyres pressures. 40psi is more than enough,btohqsg
check your driver side door sill if they have a tyre pressure recommendation. there might be one near the vehicle chassis number,btohqsg
How do i find a suitable PSI,btohqsg
Unless you changed away from the stock tyre dimensions  it should be the same pressure recommendation for u,btohqsg
@And3rs_sthis is a good starting point,btohqsg
