To whom it may concern I have 2 questions would appreciate if it could be answered as soon as possible as me and my partner have plans to apply for the Dec 2023 BTO launch.1. HFE requires for both applicants to be 21 years old. I am above the required age but my partner is currently 20 hence does not meet the requirements. Is there any possibility for me to apply for HFE?2. We both just started our first full time jobs. Working in the government sector hence we are bonded for a few years. HFE requires 12 months of pay and since we both just started our full time jobs does that mean we are unable to apply for the HFE?,btohqsg
Anybody knows the more accurate dates (to the month) of bto bidadari mop?,btohqsg
Can I ask about applying HFE  the occupier is a full-time student and working as 3 months internship and sometime work part-time  need to indicate the income?,btohqsg
Yes looks like you can't at this point.,btohqsg
it's okay. since you both are very young  keep working & hustling so that you can save $$$$$$ & afford to pay the loan in time to come :),btohqsg

Hi  anyone experiece with HFE letter grant claw back ? Initially we applied and got 30k grant for bto and 100k grant for Resale. 2 weeks later they gave me a fresh one and 0 grant for bto and 70k grant for resale. I asked why did they claw back the grant before the oct 2023 sales but did not reply me. 2 emailed to follow up later still have not heard from them. This fresh hfe was given 20 sept till now haven't heard from HDB. Hotline always cant get thru and email response takes >1 month,btohqsg
We both gave 12 months consecutive payslips and no salary adjustment yet,btohqsg

What happens if we have already chosen bto unit and pay $2k  however miss the second appointment to pay down payment?,btohqsg
Does it mean the $2k will be forfeited?,btohqsg
Nope.Normal if u get 2nd appointment the date and by end of xx/xx/xxxx date if u still never appeal then u must go down hdb and ask for another appointment,btohqsg
is there any way to see if you no-showed an appointment to choose flat? the application status for that exercise on my HDB profile page is gone,btohqsg
Not possible... You can call HDB to check when is your tentative selection date. Might be a glitch  try to clear cache and login again or log in another day to check.,btohqsg
Is there no open booking for this mth?,btohqsg
I checked with hdb. No obf or sbf till next year.,btohqsg
Obf maybe dont have next year onwards . Idk. They dont give me a confirmed answer,btohqsg
Sbf haven't out want to check OBF ? OBF is the balance of Sale of Balance. So just wait for SBF out then will have news of OBF since HDB already put 2024 for sbf,btohqsg
