Modding is asking for trouble XD,btohqsg
No need so fast one lah,btohqsg
Must take very very good care.,btohqsg
u first car no need so quick la,btohqsg
Ya how does that work also ah . Is it you decide get that car you tell the seller i want do ppi then sent to somewhere check,btohqsg
Wonder what's that material the belt made of. Titanium?üòÅ,btohqsg
Check for any wear and tear,btohqsg
1.5T known to have blinker fluid leak,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why not many around on the road,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why headlight can like get water damaged or like,btohqsg
the fogging also expensive to clear,btohqsg
newer models better can reserve charge the headlights if die,btohqsg
No but then the newer infotainment takes away from the reserve battery,btohqsg
I think you should just buy extra batteries,btohqsg
3 to 4 weeks at least,btohqsg
Okay i got a lot of stuff to learn haha shit man,btohqsg
That's why best to buy car only when you turn 40,btohqsg
Then buy car know everything already,btohqsg
We‚Äôll answer best to our knowledge,btohqsg
Did you all see the wrecked e-tron the other day at the carpark of chemical guys? - J,btohqsg
i very sad for this 335i,btohqsg
i assume the car only needs a polish then its ready to be road worthy again,btohqsg
Chemical guys will do its magic,btohqsg
Looked like a total loss to me - J,btohqsg
The airbag deployed all - J,btohqsg
Just some fender bumper clips will do its job,btohqsg
most sg insurance company view airblag deploy as total loss,btohqsg
which is damn stupid because some cars deploy airbag easily,btohqsg
what if the airbag anyhow deploy without impact like that time got one takata recall,btohqsg
but u have to understand modern car airbag and the cars of 10-20 years ago is different,btohqsg
And airbags aren't so hard to replace,btohqsg
And most new cars have sub frames that can be changed,btohqsg
Replacement of the entire dashboard is pretty much needed in many cars now because unlike the past (where there‚Äôs a rectangular cutout for airbag deployment)  our cars now have the airbags flushed beneath. This means when it deploys  it rips through. That is why I DO NOT recommend anyone to put stuffs on their dashboard  especially the passenger side.,btohqsg
Nowadays airbag is sealed into the dashboard  old cars have the small rectangular cutout,btohqsg
its not cheap to replace the whole dash,btohqsg
Unless you crash cause of the airbag deployed,btohqsg
imagine those hiace put the katana on dashboard,btohqsg
i see people put on dash also,btohqsg
if u hit the right spot  volvo airbag deploy for SAFETY purposes,btohqsg
u can see the photo on the top right  looks like almost 0 damage,btohqsg
to fix the entire car up  it wld cause upwards of 40k,btohqsg
THEN MY HELLO KITTY SOFT TOYS HOW KOR KOR,btohqsg
This is if passenger airbag deploys,btohqsg
You just be ready for plastic surgery,btohqsg
Cause the cars won't fly straight,btohqsg
wa kinda annoying sia these scammers,btohqsg
I try my best to get rid of them! - J,btohqsg
is this Mr J the same guy who reviews cars on youtube,btohqsg
i rmb got 1 J with the big bottle,btohqsg
Don't think you got the right J - J,btohqsg
