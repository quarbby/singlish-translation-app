Want to go visit also must pay 10 dollars to park  can't not have your car on show either,btohqsg
Must put in their show area,btohqsg
No other way apart from grab or driving to go as well,btohqsg
So no choice but to put your car on showcase  since only walk in is free,btohqsg

These shouldn't be the reasons to stop you from buying a particular car 👀What do you look out for when trying to shortlist the cars that you are going to buy? Is it the price of the car  is it the brand  or could the engine capacity and  hence  road tax be a key reason to avoid a certain car? 🤔Many factors come together to affect our decision when choosing a car to buy  but here are some that really don't matter as much as you think.👉🏻 Comment and share any other reasons you can think of as well!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg

Whats the difference between car loans from a bank and dealer/second hand car dealer ?,btohqsg
And banks won’t let you full loan your car,btohqsg
The latter does  thus the crazy interest rates,btohqsg
So technically speaking banks dont let you downpay any amount you want but dealers allow you . And thus they have crazy interest rates?,btohqsg
You can full loan with banks,btohqsg
Your question is between bank loans and in house loan?,btohqsg
Dont you need to die die pay 30 or 40 based of omv,btohqsg
Yea im just curious how both work exactly,btohqsg
Can just say different price ah,btohqsg
In house loan also 100% get,btohqsg
Or bank loan checks your credentials more thorough. In house don't,btohqsg
this are not loop holes. it is illegal.,btohqsg
So bank you really got to pay either 30 or 40 right be it a new or used car,btohqsg
But in house dealer loans are flexible but risky because they can charge high interest and it might change suddenly ? Or will it be fixed,btohqsg
Depends on the loan  situation by situation basis,btohqsg
