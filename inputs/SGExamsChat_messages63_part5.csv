Can apply that to irrational numbers too,btohqsg
The one in fmath is harder to solve,btohqsg
John has sqrt2 apples and Mary has sqrt3 apples,btohqsg
Doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have irrational numbers,btohqsg
H2 was just showing that the solution was valid,btohqsg
No but sqrt 2 u might actually encounter,btohqsg
2nd order DE can be considered free marks,btohqsg
But like if I cut an isosceles triangle 2 sides 1cm the other side will be sqrt 2,btohqsg
But I can’t cut i cm triangles out what,btohqsg
It’s true that the imaginary unit is not really something you’d need in daily life,btohqsg
But daily life maths stops at like P5 anyway,btohqsg
Why did they invented it? :(,btohqsg
Ok so you don't like imaginary numbers?,btohqsg
Make the life of students harder,btohqsg
Let's use (A -B; B A),btohqsg
I enjoyed imaginary numbers but I probably just didn’t see it’s application at that time,btohqsg
Most of the mathematicians who discovered it thought it was rubbish too,btohqsg
Almost all chapters in the H2 math syllabus there have probably be one application qn with some context,btohqsg
But I don’t think I saw one application qn on complex tho,btohqsg
Pretty sure some prelim paper uses it,btohqsg
Maybe some SAJC teacher set b4 idk,btohqsg
That is true  I have never seen a question of ‘real life application’ of complex,btohqsg
Quantum can go complex and quaternion no problem,btohqsg
This year a level they set an electric circuit qn for complex numbers,btohqsg
I dun take physics or f math idk what u saying,btohqsg
But I’m sure it has its uses,btohqsg
Quantum in h2 physics is no longer fun,btohqsg
How do u know what they’re coming out with this year,btohqsg
