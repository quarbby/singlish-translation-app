Shaun  we know you drive a big white harrier… no need flex like tht leh,btohqsg
Sorry bro I don’t drive Volvo,btohqsg
volvo no upz leh  no buyer at all,btohqsg
not like your harrier so upz,btohqsg
Just like harrier is a cheap lexus,btohqsg
Yea. Do phv use so exp car for what,btohqsg
dont say like tht leh  brother use original ATF for less than $10/bottle,btohqsg
people who drive at 200kph with no seat belt and botak tyres deserve more respect ok,btohqsg
No la. One day earn $1000 w a harrier more respect,btohqsg
It’s quite confusing abt the seatbelt  Taobao and harrier,btohqsg

hi out of curiousity  for cars like CX-5 with auto hold and i-stop function  can both be used at the same time or only one at a time?,btohqsg
auto hold is for parking brake  i-stop is when in drive mode,btohqsg
not possible to use both at the same time,btohqsg
They’re two different things. Auto hold puts the car on hand brake temporarily until you step the accelerator. Istop shuts off the engine to save fuel. They can be used automatically and simultaneously during a traffic jam,btohqsg
not very intuitive... when you in drive mode also can use auto hold.. but like activating cheat code in a game,btohqsg
oh yes i was wondering this. lets say im at red light  can use auto hold and i stop together?,btohqsg
you have to go ask the SA,btohqsg
Can. When you’re approaching a red light you step the foot brake until car stationary  car goes into auto hold until you step acceleration again. Engine running long enough on idle  it will auto shut off (istop) until you step acceleration again.,btohqsg
means you won't have to shift from D to P every time like those uncle drivers,btohqsg

That why buy new car is better .,btohqsg
Isn’t this the gtr that went to mt everest,btohqsg
Hallu Abang ! Long time no see,btohqsg
Exactly.. before I buy he promise the car will be given Swee Swee like brand new  when take over the car still got abrasion  all these not fix not clean,btohqsg
good catch. Looks like the same carhttps://mothership.sg/2016/11/heres-how-sporean-drove-nissan-gt-r-for-16000km-from-spore-to-everest-back/,btohqsg
Why don’t u start a business doing ppi for others. Since visual check can already and u are good at it. I’m sure nothing will bite back at you,btohqsg
Actually that is not really the dealer’s fault. If the wheel Bearing was already faulty  u would have heard something during the test drive. It’s just down to bad luck that u got it after a month. And yes wear and tear not covered.Most dealers/warranty covers only engine and gearbox issues,btohqsg
Servicing is not compulsory when they handover the car  though it can be negotiated  depending on mileage till next servicing. Even if bought from AD. And car plate LED  again  it’s just bad luck  but anyway it’s like a $10 thing,btohqsg
U could have changed so many wheel bearings for yourself,btohqsg
His wheel bearings would only cost $10 each coz he master sourcer one,btohqsg
Other people $400-500. He only $10-15 max. And that’s on a bad day.,btohqsg
He already. From PHV. Don’t downgrade him pls…,btohqsg
Be careful if the dealer let you test the car on low petrol  it's their dirty trick,btohqsg
Ooh never heard of this before haha. Thanks for the heads up,btohqsg
Yeah  insist go top up petrol so you can drive further and faster,btohqsg
I generally will check cos most of the cars they don’t keep a lot of petrol in it for money saving purposes,btohqsg
The one I had tested  left only 1 bar petrol and gave lame excuse no time to top up,btohqsg
Lol I drive till I don’t see any bars on my own car,btohqsg
After you whack  car spoil how? Who pay,btohqsg
but i test drive with my fren before,btohqsg
he really pedal to the metal. then i tell him car cannot buy,btohqsg
if 5min whack car can die means car PROBLEM LIAO BROOO,btohqsg
lol like this dealership i went to before to view c180k  petrol so low already  car whacked with modification  when on   very loud knocking noise the fella say is the turbocharger 😭,btohqsg
Yes sir. Car old liao  need to use premium fuel to feel young,btohqsg
Anyone familiar on how a certain tele group is selling short term cars below 10k and buying them back at almost 90% of their value after its coe end,btohqsg
interested in how they are able to obtain new cars everyday to sell,btohqsg
but would the buyer still be responsible for its road tax and insurance?,btohqsg
ya but how are they profiting from this though,btohqsg
any experts can come share ur insights,btohqsg
imaginw they just ciao with your money 😂,btohqsg
6k for a conti car rental 1montu,btohqsg
no free money in this world de\,btohqsg
900 for 1 month still expensive. The unused insurance give u back only abt 80% when scrap. Buy back price subject to t&c. Anything spoilt or worse can’t move will lose even more money,btohqsg
During that 1 month  if u made accident and it’s ur fault  u won’t get any insurance back,btohqsg
But the dealer also earn little and subject to lemon law,btohqsg
Both sides High risk. Export earlier sua,btohqsg
confirm have people using this export cars with short coe left to do illegal things .,btohqsg
Like… go JB with almost empty tank and pump 95?,btohqsg
no laa  i meant things like they use this short term cars to purchase illegal items to smuggle in,btohqsg
Like Jerry cans of 95 to sell in Singapore?,btohqsg
That’s illegal on so many levels! 🤣🤣,btohqsg
A bit. Without any details also very hard to help.,btohqsg
This one really gone case. The seller just do the bare minimum so they won't have to pay the buyer the reimbursement  will keep dragging it until the buyer give up.,btohqsg

Hi  I'm new.For a COE car costing 54k with 5 yrs left  is it wise to buy?Let's say if COE drops to normal levels in 2.5 yearsDoes it mean in theory no one would buy from me at 25k ?,btohqsg
Highly likely yes to ur qn,btohqsg
If u buy high coe drops then new car significantly cheaper,btohqsg
Then u LL drive until end lo,btohqsg
Tks for confirming.. overwhelmed as first timerI see many ads no mileage one  is it to hide the high mileage ? But then 99% i heard can alter it.. so I'm curious,btohqsg
they hide the mileage so you dm them and get interested,btohqsg
must see how well the owner maintain,btohqsg
Unfortunately that is the market now,btohqsg
for that price im sure can get conti but 3-4 yrs left,btohqsg
Recommend u find a parf car japanese madr abt 12k dep,btohqsg
last time Toyota wish zne 10 60k 10 yrs,btohqsg
If its your first car  i’d rather u just buy one with 1-2 years left  seeing as the coe price is at a unappealing range  no benefit to buying long term car right now + u may not like the car for that long,btohqsg
Also in my experience  if its a coe vios that isnt long left u scratch it as inexperienced driver not so heart pain lol,btohqsg

K3 got carplay built in already,btohqsg

Price go up quite a lot from when first launch haha 😅,btohqsg
I tht now then go up? Pre CNY was like 229ish leh,btohqsg
But you can get a second hand GLB35 around this price range now,btohqsg
Haha no i was at c&c before cny list price ady close to 250k  and that is just base glb180 model,btohqsg
Dun look like have much addon options too 😅,btohqsg
Oh because i got mine for around 22X lol,btohqsg
thats why when you said you say its 250 im like ??,btohqsg
Wah ok means list price can nego down to there i guess haha,btohqsg
Yours is the mild hybrid model?,btohqsg

would rather have a car with full features than this dh that dh,btohqsg
Nothing surprising. Unless you buy an S-Class  likely wont get full spec,btohqsg
Thats why i feel its better to buy a full spec Toyota Century than a E300 haha,btohqsg
Full spec camry no power window,btohqsg
the press one time wind all the way,btohqsg
But it is an indentable option?,btohqsg

I think they trying to keep the cat A glb180 super basic  last time when you buy were there a lot of addon/custom options? Cuz they are bringing in cat b glb200 according to what sa told me also that will hv more options,btohqsg
Dunno why they want to do that though feels super meaningless,btohqsg
no options to add at all.,btohqsg
Even seat colour also nothing rite lol,btohqsg
wow then i should have waited sia,btohqsg
But the glb200 is cat b  so for glb180 now close to 250k  glb200 prob close to 300k if not more?,btohqsg
At that price point totally make no sense ady might as well buy skoda kodiaq haha,btohqsg
Just tune back to 160hp can be glb200 Lor,btohqsg
but isit legal for me to tune it more than 130hp if  my car is cat a,btohqsg
