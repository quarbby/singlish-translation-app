"Lude Media claimed the audio had been provided by a group of senior members of the PLA who ""risked their own lives to expose the evil plan of Xi Jinping (ÁøíËøëÂπ≥) and the CCP to the civilized world.""",btohqsg
This phrasing makes it sound fake,btohqsg
Most Chinese won't think it's an evil plan,btohqsg
They may not agree with the idea but the word evil sticks out,btohqsg
I talk to a Chinese colleague of mine who think it‚Äôs alright to take Taiwan back by force,btohqsg
Firstly you must consider they hear alot of nationalistic view on this. 2ndly many do believe TW is Chinese territory,btohqsg
So that's why I say even if they don't want a war  to call it evil is unnatural,btohqsg
I have been in China for years and can't imagine a Chinese telling me it's an evil plan. Just weird,btohqsg
Interesting this TW site article poster uses some Ang Mor name too,btohqsg

"üéâPika World Bit Size Update ‚Äì 27 May 2022üéâ‚úàÔ∏èThe Rally ContinuesüóΩThursday was a strong showing for the stock market after Fed minutes showed signs of a possible slow down in rate hikes in the future. The equity market remains steady with all major indices in green territory  moving the week ahead with a likely green closing after seven weekly declines.Investors largely attributed the two-day rally to the less aggressive Fed minutes stance. The bond market is also pricing fewer rate hikes as the two-year Treasury yield had fallen to 2.49% from its peak of 2.76% in early May.Still  Pika World believes that there is no lack of headwinds  and the scale could tip anytime again. So with that  Pika World closes some trading positions in Nvidia and Facebook in the previous tiny accumulation after a significant decline in their shares.üéâAlibaba: A blue sky with milky cloudsüå¥It was a sigh of relief for investors as the sales were less disastrous than thought. Revenue came in at $32.2 billion  hitting the $30.8 billion expectation. This is enough to send Alibaba shares higher by more than 10%. It is indeed a reversal as the share price had fallen by about 56% for the past 12 months.The sold off was built on the premise that Covid's lockdown in China would drag consumer spending as energy prices soar. However  while supply chains and consumer sentiments remained challenging  Alibaba has been able to build a ""value proposition""  as said by its CEO  Daniel Zhang.Pika World believes things are moving in the right direction for the company. While we remain vested in the counter  the lack of an outlook seems undesirable but understandable. After all  there are fewer visibilities and more uncertainties again. So let's monitor the health of Alibaba till the following earning report.It is 27 May  Friday   9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a joyous weekend ahead!",btohqsg
