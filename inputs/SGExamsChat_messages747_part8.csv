unless its someone u rly care for personally,btohqsg
i mean empathy is ok up to the point it takes a toll on you,btohqsg

you can empathise without getting invested imo,btohqsg
"""oil up gga im coming in 10 mins to touch you""",btohqsg
like i will empathise with your shit but it doesnâ€™t mean iâ€™ll make it my problem,btohqsg
and people need to stop getting coddled,btohqsg
ya true most people suck at setting boundaries,btohqsg
if you canâ€™t set boundaries then donâ€™t get involved,btohqsg
Or just don't give a shit and come in guns blazing,btohqsg
for people i really care about iâ€™m ok with coddling when they need it but even then thereâ€™s a limit ma,btohqsg
even if itâ€™s my partner iâ€™m gonna get drained af if i gotta coddle them 24/7,btohqsg

most people dont even deserve empathy,btohqsg
If u wan empathy and trauma dump that's what UCC is for,btohqsg
so i rather focus my limited capacity on my friend who is sad and has a problem,btohqsg
than someone dying halfway across the world,btohqsg
Bro I can listen but I can tell u my advise is this is your problem,btohqsg

sympathy is usually very uncalled for like you think they deserve pity which is kinda judging them,btohqsg
and u cant even help them so u so sad for palestine for what,btohqsg
Honestly why do ppl want pity?,btohqsg
It's like begging why tf would one wish to guilt someone into that,btohqsg
i mean even for my friends  sometimes i gotta set my boundaries so they donâ€™t start relying on me as a trauma dump,btohqsg
only for when theyâ€™re in bad spots kinda thing,btohqsg

empathy isnâ€™t one singular thing. itâ€™s a spectrum,btohqsg
It takes a lot of courage to even apply for it and go through trials to get into something you wanted,btohqsg
