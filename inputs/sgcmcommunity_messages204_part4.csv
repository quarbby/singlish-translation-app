Hi guys  driving Lancer EX left 1 year. Headlights flicker slightly when using signal lights. Is this concerning or i can leave it? No flicker when braking/hazard lights on. Just noticed it tdy  been driving for 2+ years no issue,btohqsg
Wah I see many mg zs EV on used car market sia,btohqsg
Many between 3 to 5 yrs old,btohqsg
EV is faster sell before 5yrs,btohqsg
I think is Gen 1 MG ZS,btohqsg
wa the amt of scammers seriously,btohqsg
i heard ev no parf or arf value or smth  so once 10 years is up  no money back vs ICE cars. why ah LOL,btohqsg
No arf paid  so no parf lo,btohqsg
That's why I was wondering  does it mean it's lesser loss to get EV compared to getting a non EV,btohqsg
Low price ev is buy and hug until 10 years scrap at $0,btohqsg
Many agents u dont ask they don’t say also.. i went mg  gac  byd all same.. keep quiet until u ask,btohqsg
That's what I've been trying to confirm🤭🤭,btohqsg
If sueh sueh gotta scrap  only get back remaining coe plus scrap value,btohqsg
So financing an EV is like balloon scheme,btohqsg
Car has 0 value  better drive all the way,btohqsg
Actually hybrid also lower parf value due to incentives,btohqsg
2025  the market will be flooded w used EV I think,btohqsg
I wld feel plug in hybrid is the best solution,btohqsg
No one will buy cozCoe up ev price stay,btohqsg
If it's not moving  dealers won't take it,btohqsg
Most dare not take if not open price like 100k138k purchased  after 2 years,btohqsg
If intend to sell car better not buy Ev,btohqsg

Used car sellers may just give lips service to say it's being processed but nothing is done. Or new buyers of used car may not be aware and just purchase without checking.Sadly  the only way to find out if the car is registered with VEP is when new owner tries to register to get the notification.,btohqsg
