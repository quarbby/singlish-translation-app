did you at least try the dumb level system,btohqsg
i think it was a good idea bad execution,btohqsg
should be like class or car type at least,btohqsg
i tried the game for the whole of half an hour,btohqsg
you have to upgrade per car...,btohqsg
seems like they did nothing to fix the game,btohqsg
i had all the assists turned off  max everything,btohqsg
in fact  in comparison to FM7 this feels awful.,btohqsg
honestly atp i don’t rmb how fm7 feels,btohqsg
the thing is they changed the shift mechanics with this,btohqsg
i just rmb fh3 being fire,btohqsg
"so you can't really ""heel toe"" without the game eating shit",btohqsg
i literally didn’t play enough to tell,btohqsg
feels the same  just slightly better.,btohqsg
and my moza stuff couldn’t bind properly,btohqsg
ya i heard moza is fucked on FM,btohqsg
forza ffb has never been good  they've somehow made it worse,btohqsg
i loved the series for so long,btohqsg
"funny how they milked the ""from the ground up"" thing and it was the same old shit since FM5",btohqsg
they peaked with FH3 and FM6 imo,btohqsg
WRC is crap because of the physics engine  but the upcoming one is based off UE5(?) and Dirt 2.0 physics,btohqsg
though the historic car roster is abit lacklustre,btohqsg
cos WRC is under Codies now,btohqsg
why cant anyone count to three,btohqsg
*zero*2017-2021cars aside from a Fiesta and Polo,btohqsg
you wouldn't want your parents to count to 3 with a cane in the hand would you,btohqsg
in comparison to the subies  yes,btohqsg
so the only GD Impreza is the Bugeye,btohqsg
tbh the bugeye is probably the most iconic one,btohqsg
i'd say the GD gen was iconic back then,btohqsg
tbf all the subies are iconic,btohqsg
except the 2011 sedan. we dont talk about that,btohqsg
i think there are 2 hatches actually,btohqsg
the NR4 spec and the WRC spec.,btohqsg
eh the senna outside rm is tht till when?,btohqsg
iirc it was just there for the opening,btohqsg
if they reuse the DR2 impreza,btohqsg
especially the GC8. they scanned the wrong car.,btohqsg
iirc they scanned the wrong year. someone pointed it out in a thread awhile back,btohqsg
i think they scanned the later 96 Impreza instead of the 95,btohqsg
and wrong plates on the 95 one too,btohqsg
think the DR2 one was L***ZAC or something,btohqsg
but that aside  the Rally 1 cars are promising. a friend of mine got to try out the dev build with a R16,btohqsg
he races R4 or R5 cars iirc  it's a great step up from DR2 in terms of physics.,btohqsg
the game yes  the rallying no,btohqsg
or maybe they just overlooked it,btohqsg
fella hit a tree and fractured his hand,btohqsg
they could just scan the whole car,btohqsg
i almost with my r9 tho,btohqsg
think he hit a rut and it yeeted him into a tree,btohqsg
