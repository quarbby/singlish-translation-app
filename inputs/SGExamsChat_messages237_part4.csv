this can be because of so many different things,btohqsg
but brakes/gears i think no need hor?,btohqsg
cuz i too used to the shimano one,btohqsg
i forgot how to use the normal one that most bikes have,btohqsg
I think normal u referring to is friction shifters,btohqsg
which is u press then it auto change for u,btohqsg
how to change gear with that one?,btohqsg
u literally need to manually push the lever until your chain aligns with the gear lor,btohqsg
ehhhh idk  I've not used a friction shifter in so long,btohqsg
just change the gear shifter right?,btohqsg
like i dont change the gears,btohqsg
but u need to watch out for the compatibility also ah,btohqsg
but i use the shimano shifter,btohqsg
depends on what kind of derailleurs u have,btohqsg
how much is it to change the whole gear tho?,btohqsg
like the gear shifters plus derailleur,btohqsg

not sure exactly which part you changed since there's a lot that goes into the transmission but 45 isn't too much for bicycle stuff .. say you use your bike daily for 3 months that's only 50c every day :),btohqsg
