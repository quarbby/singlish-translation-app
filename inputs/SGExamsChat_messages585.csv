Aiyo I just wear pig tails or bend down jkjk,btohqsg
Bro I think it’s freelance eh but the freelance got contract to sign,btohqsg
that was being a casher at taka,btohqsg
HM lol we might have worked under the same guy,btohqsg
Lowest I worked was 15 years old for $7,btohqsg
Do uk a guy named George or smth,btohqsg
mine was $7 for being promoter,btohqsg
besides that would be some flyer job,btohqsg
I know no George but you can dm me the agency,btohqsg
and need to take evidence for flyer,btohqsg
like after stuff the flyer to the unit  need take photo,btohqsg
I mean irs whether ur happy with the $12/hr,btohqsg
I used to do similar shit for $6,btohqsg
Funny thing I got dismissed on the first day of work at one of the 5 star hotel 🤡🤡  idk wtf I do,btohqsg
The ones I met are really nice and friendly though…,btohqsg
oh now i rmb  got one job is $5 for being fake customer at this hotel,btohqsg
they scared got ppl steal their bag,btohqsg
Might be just the girls then,btohqsg
coz they got this bag fair,btohqsg
The incoming rgs batch into RI,btohqsg
Like its actually elitist as fk it's kinda scary,btohqsg
but their bags no pricetag and the scanner,btohqsg
They look down on any sch that isn't RJC,btohqsg
I’ll save a $1000 and start drop shipping business/s,btohqsg
I just taught some of them,btohqsg
so anyone canjust walk out without paying,btohqsg
"Then they were like ""why should I practice other sch paper when RI is the best""",btohqsg
"my ns junior just told me ""im from acs"" when i dont even ask him abt it",btohqsg
Isn't there these JC kids that kept doing tiktoks? Was it sajc,btohqsg
I mean can you blame them? Even our politicians who are in their 60s still compare secondary schools so…,btohqsg
101 ways to start a conversation,btohqsg
Cuz they're like INSISTENT that you only need to do ri papers to succeed,btohqsg
The funniest thing is RI doesn't even set the hardest or like most creative papers in singapore anymore,btohqsg
I rly hope these people flunk a levels,btohqsg
I dropped them after 1 lesson,btohqsg
The whole lesson they were just telling me like your method sucks cuz ur not from Ri,btohqsg
And im like okay then why do u even wanna like,btohqsg
Cuz they heard abt my track record,btohqsg
I have a 45% distinction rate at prelims,btohqsg
Which is effectively on par with RIs overall distinction for GP,btohqsg
That was just 2h of my life I wasted,btohqsg
Thinking abt the way u write,btohqsg
So students tend to be able to develop stronger personal voice and can come up with more original arguments,btohqsg
Rather than what they force memo,btohqsg
There's this RI kid I used to teach,btohqsg
And the cher just forced them to memo content pack after content pack,btohqsg
I mean if u saw what I said in the o level chat  the method worksIt's just tiring  boring and like not fun and largely ineffective,btohqsg
There's this psc scholar from RI,btohqsg
Who told my friend who's taking a levels,btohqsg
Literally he not even answering rhe qn u tell him chat gpt bro he gonna go off,btohqsg
He told me his points and I was like this is so chat gpt and he was like yeah its what chatgpt normally tells me to write,btohqsg
If the exact same qn comes out,btohqsg
Anyways I was like damn confused with these future ri students cuz they did send me past work,btohqsg
"One of them their paragraph was deadass""Some works of art can be more meaningful cause they are more technically complex. Since these works of art are more technically complex  the are more meaningful. (Proceeds to dump 3 examples). Therefore  some works of art are more meaningful""",btohqsg
Apparantlt that's what they are taught to write??,btohqsg
"should be like that lecturer that says "" hello can u address me as dr xxx instead of cher?""",btohqsg
that's the level of my chinese compo writing ngl,btohqsg
I genuinely feel rgs students are the most full of themselves arrogant students,btohqsg
There are students who don't listen to me is like abit annoying alrThese people  ask me for help  don't want listen  question what I'm saying  then shit on my teaching,btohqsg
Not even abt ego being hurt or anything,btohqsg
Is it cuz their ego too big or smth,btohqsg
U want my feedback I give u feedback,btohqsg
Then u say my feedback useless,btohqsg
Then bro don't waste my time,btohqsg
"So much for coming from an ""elite"" sch",btohqsg
Theres o level schs who set harder papers than them,btohqsg
And set more conceptually interesting qns,btohqsg
Imagine them getting off their high horse,btohqsg
And shit on the Jae kids,btohqsg
bro dont mind me asking  are u working now or,btohqsg
I used to teach in ej,btohqsg

Ns allowance more than enough anyways,btohqsg
if the students fail den its on u,btohqsg
Legit? I thought they damn strict abt it  at least from what I observed on Reddit,btohqsg
Anyways the idea of moonlighting is,btohqsg
guys how fix red eye without going to doctor pls pls,btohqsg
So long as it doesn't impede ur ability to do ur job,btohqsg
Idk man $800 allowance seems too little for me,btohqsg
You answered Ur own qn LOL  just go to doctor bruh,btohqsg
Sorry to say this but time for home amputation,btohqsg
Where got ppl fix red eye on their own without going doc 😭,btohqsg

like if i dont touch it,btohqsg
At most$90 transportFree food from camp everydayWeekends total abt $100 for activities and stuffRemaining ~ $400 I spend on my friends family to help him pay bills,btohqsg
Oh the photos app on your phone shd have the “red-eye” option,btohqsg
The only thing that I think may help but idk if it would help,btohqsg
I’ll have to find out myself in 3 months time,btohqsg
And if ur a downpes mfer like me,btohqsg
U effectively have as much time as me,btohqsg
Imagine being in army in 2023,btohqsg
Prolly in March or smth  I haven’t even gotten letter yet lol,btohqsg
I thought NS gonna be stingy with food lmao,btohqsg
I can get double the amount of protein and fats COMBINED in carbs/meal,btohqsg
Nah idc about this volume > quality,btohqsg
Bro lemme give u a tip,btohqsg
Start buying gorilla feed in bulk,btohqsg
It's comparable to food court food,btohqsg
Make frozen chicken look gourmet in comparison,btohqsg
Wym by okay? It's just edible?,btohqsg
But ns fd cnnt choose rite,btohqsg
The rgs students parents just asked me why I dropped them,btohqsg
So which is best in your opinion?,btohqsg
they're a pain in my ass,btohqsg
the auntie uncle also 0 wibes,btohqsg
they scold my friend coz he wanted extra rice,btohqsg
I said I can't stand them,btohqsg
"uncle just dead ass said ""so fat rdy still wan eat so much""",btohqsg
eh ngl the best part of the breadfast is white bread + kaya,btohqsg
idc what is the rest i eat this can rdy,btohqsg
They don’t know he bulking 😂,btohqsg
I'll let my record speak for itself lah,btohqsg
I think rgs students are spoiled,btohqsg
Sorry that’s even funnier  no offence,btohqsg
I had a friend his sis from rgs,btohqsg
in your opinion is it harder to teach students with 0 interest or students that are way too smart,btohqsg
Complained that their parents couldn't send her to sch at 7am  when she stayed one bus stop away,btohqsg
There is no student that knows everything,btohqsg
Apparantly she doesn't know how to take bus/train,btohqsg
like in your case that ri kid say you doing wrong method,btohqsg
I'll just put in no effort,btohqsg
To meIf you don't wanna listen --> no interest,btohqsg
Students who think they know everything don't,btohqsg
i thought never eat at hawker & coffeeshop already next level enough,btohqsg
And that's everyone in general tbvh,btohqsg
Like rgs students would just go orchard to eat after sch,btohqsg
Easier to trach is the first one,btohqsg
A guy who don't know what he dont know  the fun part is finding whst he doesn't know,btohqsg
it is easier to just rewrite a entire code than fault finding,btohqsg
And not even at the same time,btohqsg
oh i started drinkinh alcohol at 12,btohqsg
it is easier to not make a mistake to begin with 🥱@chemcer,btohqsg
I have elite sch students telling me they don't know that ww2 was a thing,btohqsg
I have students telling me they have no clue that Africa had multiple countries within it,btohqsg
Wait for someone sign on spf,btohqsg
I literally had an RJ student text me that they didn't understand a compre passage and asked me to explain it to them,btohqsg
A few weeks before a levels,btohqsg
how long did ur hair stay curly,btohqsg
Yeah I'm talking abt students in general,btohqsg
Even for me I won't know everything what,btohqsg
U ask me what's happening in Sao tome and principe like,btohqsg
Apart from it being a SIDS with damn gd nature vibes,btohqsg
what motivated u to do that at that age? I was trying hard not to shit my pants for PSLE,btohqsg
Got no labels of the countries,btohqsg
Like bri no one gonna care whether uk where Lesotho is or not,btohqsg
"LOL my sec3 geo cher told us dont bother trying h2 geo and ""yall can barely name 5 oceans""",btohqsg
Useless  I just watched a bunch of history documentaries and I can already identify like 80% of the countries on the map,btohqsg
got one time in pri i asked the korea students that are they from north or south,btohqsg
now thinking back if they from north there is something wrong lol,btohqsg
Can't u be uh real with them or smth,btohqsg
i mean  the name itself is a hint also LOL,btohqsg
people dont like to hear real things,btohqsg
If people dk where India is,btohqsg
If it has came to that point  it has to be heard,btohqsg
They also know where the indian ocean is,btohqsg
Ngl it's not even abt knowing where it is,btohqsg
Like it’s literally 1 mili byte of information in your brain,btohqsg
Lol then are they that unwilling to accept that as a reason? 💀,btohqsg
like she couldnt believe her child was like this,btohqsg
yeah You’re not even obliged to deal with this shit in the first place,btohqsg
i thought Philippines had no internet until my teacher told us abt it 💀💀💀,btohqsg
always rmb dont say means nvr happen,btohqsg
Stop recording the moment u step in camp,btohqsg
can i go up to bunk and rest,btohqsg
You gotta ask the dumb qns b4 u become smart,btohqsg
Got one of my junior ask me this,btohqsg
When he know the ans to it,btohqsg
And he whines when ppl tell him no,btohqsg
U could go up and no body knows,btohqsg
And if yes got go through surgery?,btohqsg
I had a bee or smth sting me near my eye once,btohqsg
Like was it pain for a few days on the eye,btohqsg
isnt stye like a pimple or smtg?,btohqsg
And then sometimes got white crust,btohqsg
Yeah but it healed on its own  was pretty swollen,btohqsg
yes. and it depends on severity. if very long never recover pls do see a doc,btohqsg
But he say might need go surgery,btohqsg
And why I never get eye cream sia,btohqsg
i mean my eye swelled up earlier this yr  went to see doc and was just given eye drops i think,btohqsg
How long you take to recover,btohqsg
yeah i did minor surgery on my stye bef. it was there for 4 weeks  not going away  so had to lol,btohqsg
Did you had a pimple in your eye,btohqsg
idk man i think it was just swollen,btohqsg
i mean if not srs can just put hot towel on it,btohqsg
u never drop eyedrops bef ah???,btohqsg
those of u who have younger siblings will know  need to be super clear abt instructions,btohqsg
my dumb little sis was cooking one time and she washed the meat with soap 💀,btohqsg
because i didnt say dun use soap,btohqsg
me dumb self thought 洗钱 means literally wash money,btohqsg
but iwas like 5 so yeah,btohqsg
oh and to your previous qn  u will be surprised to see how no body knows what they are doing even at the age of 18,btohqsg
reminds of white ppl who will wash rice with dish soap,btohqsg
Uncle roger putting his leg down,btohqsg
there are childish people regardless of age,btohqsg
being 18 doesn't mean u auto know what to do,btohqsg
your parents dont complain coz they got no energy to do it,btohqsg
Bro how old r u even,btohqsg
their generation is work hard and actually getting rewarded for it,btohqsg
and no uni still can earn a living,btohqsg
Oh I thought ur sec 4 lmao,btohqsg
their time if u got depression  no body give af,btohqsg
It's a continuous journey till death,btohqsg
"isn't that like saying ""you're not dead  just dying""",btohqsg
It’s only cuz of the Internet that people are hearing about it now,btohqsg
"would like to use this quote from band of brothers ""The only hope you have is to accept the fact that you're already dead. """,btohqsg
nt rlly ah just people starting to realise how bad it is,btohqsg
and proper research show that mental health is something that we should take care of,btohqsg
we went from starving every meal to have people purposely starving so they can lose weight,btohqsg
Yeah I think our gen has got way worse problems than our parents’,btohqsg
every gen thinks this way also,btohqsg
every generation have their own set of problems,btohqsg
But it’s true though  we’ve been through the “Internet revolution” which was already one of the big milestones,btohqsg
You don’t get stuff like this every century  last time was pretty chill without any major changes,btohqsg
"yes the rate of change has never been higher  but not sure it means ""way worse problems""",btohqsg
what is the problem u are facing now,btohqsg
The problems we face now are so new that even politicians dk what tf they are,btohqsg
because we fixed all the old problems,btohqsg
I have little problems  but I’m very sure our generation as a whole has many,btohqsg
Like short attention spans  misinformation blah blah,btohqsg
brother your generation didnt even get to vote yet (im assuimg u are 05 and below),btohqsg
As how everyone is always learning :),btohqsg
do u think misinformation is worse now compared to before internet  or before books (printing press)?,btohqsg
God is a state we will continually try to reach,btohqsg
depends  after brexit  politicians found out that they can mine info from people,btohqsg
now they can inject ideas to u,btohqsg
Yes it’s way worse now you go out on the street 5 mins alr can see one retard,btohqsg
im actually worried when young ppl care so much abt politics,btohqsg
next thing is go on streets liao,btohqsg
last time is u dont know anything unless u search for it,btohqsg
now is new facts everyday from tiktok,btohqsg
"yes  it's karl marx ""class consciousness""",btohqsg
and when the less people know the more they think they know,btohqsg
"suddenly u have bunch of ""experts""",btohqsg
It’s really just marketing and appealing to the audience at this point,btohqsg
now its so easy to express your opinion that you may not stop to think about whether its wrong/biased,btohqsg
dont forget how people exploit misinformation for profit,btohqsg
so was it better previously when your local library decided everything u could read?,btohqsg
Most of the retards who do shit like that have nothing better to do that’s why wanna appear cool,btohqsg
i have no answer  i can see both sides,btohqsg
tbh always got people like that but now internet gives them an anonymous platform to spread such takes,btohqsg
No they didn’t really “decide” it  you still have the power to select books you wanna read. Whereas nowadays  one search on Google is enough to determine your entire feed on other apps as well  kinda like giving you too much of what you might be interested in,btohqsg
Of course you can opt out  but most are not likely to since it’s more convenient than a book,btohqsg
"they did though. they would say ""j k rowling not woke enough  all harry potter books banned"". and before internet  that really was the end of your access",btohqsg
Yeah echo chambers are real and are very profitable,btohqsg
This topic is on censorship  I’d say the internet is far better in addressing that,btohqsg
yeah  i'm just saying  censorship & misinformation are 2 sides of the same coin,btohqsg
internet now is getting more and more dead because u only able to see what u like to see,btohqsg
algo purposely make it this way so u can scroll through tiktok and youtube forever,btohqsg
"""i have chest pain whenever i palms down""",btohqsg
my bmt bunkmate got excuse push up,btohqsg
what's the weirdest excuse you've seen,btohqsg
during technician trade course and that guy wanna ooc,btohqsg
how do you even excuse dust,btohqsg

But guy was sleeping in the day,btohqsg
you know ns the filing cabinet,btohqsg

yeah i got mine coz i was supporting,btohqsg
they give out to us coz,btohqsg
we technician are like god to them,btohqsg
when their vehicle got issues we go over and no more issues liao,btohqsg

just imagine rsaf boots but no zipper,btohqsg
coz by right should have ah,btohqsg
den idk liao coz by right should have for technicians,btohqsg
and we have our own coverall,btohqsg
abit like the tankie wear one but with camo,btohqsg
damn hard to wear at first,btohqsg
but once u get use to it quite easy to wear,btohqsg

at least scammer cant use our life time savings,btohqsg
the comment section say we cant use them,btohqsg
just curious  those who buy from taobao rite  what kind of card do y'all use to ensure the cheapest exchange currency LOL,btohqsg

Any tips on how to live as a fully functional independent adult lolIm finally moving out,btohqsg
Help I choked on my saliva the moment I saw this,btohqsg
I just thought the way they were advertising it was funny and sketchy,btohqsg
It's not smth u see everyday for sure,btohqsg
not sure how many people even know the original karate kid at this point,btohqsg
i had to google to find the original website calling for casting,btohqsg
Maybe some have watched as a kiddo 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
idk man the original was before even i was born,btohqsg
Some parents may show what they had watched as a child … that’s how those Disney movies become classics,btohqsg
The person who created that is prob like a middle aged man or a boomer,btohqsg
i don't disagree but tbf they don't need any fancy advertising,btohqsg
Ya  they could type out font 12 in Comic Sans and will draw plenty of attention anyway,btohqsg
10 mins is all it took me,btohqsg
i hope it’s not one of the paid in exposure,btohqsg

wa bro i jus realise u from electrical eng,btohqsg
electrical knowledge used to fix lights at home,btohqsg
I thought logic gate was bad enough,btohqsg
Den i learn about state diagram,btohqsg
across 2 sets of parents house and my own place,btohqsg
+ I dare to buy China stuff come fix  save even more,btohqsg
used to use it. Then it was really irritating and spoil switches fast,btohqsg
I learn about the flip flop and how it works,btohqsg
Not like in poly touch n go,btohqsg
With nand gates u can create everything,btohqsg
And logic gates are based from transistors,btohqsg
I think they try to dumb down for u but it failed,btohqsg
But the roots is u connect the transistor in certain way,btohqsg
And when current flow through u get and / or gates,btohqsg
After logic gate u need to learn how to come out with k maps,btohqsg
Which is easy if your prof teach good,btohqsg
If u know how to read the wave form,btohqsg
Dumbass went to smoke near police car,btohqsg
It is easier coz u dont need to write down everything,btohqsg
U just write down the 1,btohqsg
All the 0s u can ignore,btohqsg
U see jf u can understand this anot,btohqsg
This is for sr flip flop,btohqsg
wait until u learn circuit designing using ICs,btohqsg
This looks like some graph I would see when I learnt audio engineering,btohqsg
then your project is like some game and u need to use like 8 to 12 ICs to power it,btohqsg
Basically it shows that the output q only goes to 1 when either s or r input is opposite(1 or 0 ),btohqsg
But ok la yall still got time,btohqsg
U see after 1 wk i throw back everything i learn,btohqsg
not too hard  but all return to teacher alr,btohqsg
They want u to apply it,btohqsg
Like how to use flipflop to design a circuit,btohqsg
