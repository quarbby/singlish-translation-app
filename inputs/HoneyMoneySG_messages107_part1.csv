Anyone go pump petrol in Malaysia? Which CC is better or use Youtrip better?,btohqsg
There's no formula. Then gain is given to you upfront as the refund amt  then you get back the face value after t-bills mature. If purchasing 10k  only pay 9k plus after refund. When t-bills matures  you get back 10k,btohqsg

What you mean offer you 50$ ?,btohqsg
Really . They give you $$ for retention ?,btohqsg
I think in 2024 many people cancel this ocbc rewards card...,btohqsg
Yes. Need to complete 5 transactions on any amount. Then they will transfer $50 to your account,btohqsg
I never keep track on that. Nowadays I just use this card to spend on venus   guardian and watson to earn 6 miles.,btohqsg
I'm using Amaze + Citi Cashback (8%),btohqsg
Yes  Amaze converts your transactions to SGD  but fx rate around ~2% lousier than Youtrip/Trust,btohqsg
can we awarded 10x point using CRMC+Amaza  for JB petrol?,btohqsg
As long MCC not excluded in t&c,btohqsg
Submit interbank GIRO form through mail and wait between 4-6 weeks for approval. If you submitted your form to AMEX on 6 Apr when your first query was answered  you would probably have it approved and ready for May's statement.,btohqsg
Anyone facing this issue too  when trying to add citi rewards card into amaze?,btohqsg
UOB today can link to amaze already,btohqsg

Anyone knows what credit card to use for alan photo?,btohqsg
Wrong answers only?You need to tell us whether cashback or miles at least? And what cards you have?,btohqsg
Is citirewards with amaze ok? Or is HSBC Revolution?,btohqsg
HSBC mcc whitelist so I rather not use thatWill do with amaze and CRMC or UOB PPV,btohqsg
If I use UOB PPV Apple Pay in foreign countries  does it count as mobile contactless 4mpd?,btohqsg
oh  did u receive 4mpd? Or must you still meet the $1k local spending first?,btohqsg
Revolution is no longer as good as before. Milelion has rate it . Not a must to take,btohqsg
Ppv no minimum spend  uob vs is the one with 1k foreign spending,btohqsg
anyone know if telco and my republic can be rewarded with points with the DBS woman's world card ?,btohqsg
depends whether it is process as online,btohqsg
Does anyone know if Citi hotpot or Hai Di Lao purchases qualify for the HSBC 5% rebates ?Also will in get the 1x rewards ?,btohqsg
Just wondering  if I link Citi rewards MasterCard with amaze  and use amaze on Gpay can I qualify for the same 10X rewards point as if I am using the physical card?,btohqsg
I don't think UOB VI is for miles earning... That's more for luxury I think?,btohqsg
Hi I am new to crmc+ amaze  to earn 4mpd for in app transactions like shoppee  spotify or Netflix  do I use crmc or amaze card(linking to crmc)?,btohqsg
If in app can use directly as long as is not recurring charge. Shopee is fine but not top up to shopee pay,btohqsg
Hi  could I get some advice as am trying to research but still not too clear on the various options.For purchases under Electronics (Apple products specifically)  does this qualify under the 10x Citi Rewards points if I buy direct from Apple online store? As the terms seem to only be specifically for online clothing and accessories store.Checked out Heymax as well and it seems to be one of the better cards to use to clock mpd  but trying to figure out if it‚Äôs 10x points or 1x point for the Electronics MCC.Thanks!,btohqsg
I dont think u can use googlepay for paynow qr link to card for pay  gpay for paynow qr always deduct from bank acct,btohqsg
There seem to be some issue with apple website online payment report by other as being offline. U can always get from apple flagship from shopee and lazada plus use coupon there for better deal,btohqsg
CRMC award 10x points for all online txn excluding travel MCC... But specifically for Apple Online pls try to use it with Amaze. Like@qqplacessaid  there's chance your transaction is coded as non-online (i.e. chip based) then your 4mpd become 0.4mpd.But rmb the 1k cap applies.,btohqsg
Oh good point on the other platforms  thanks for the suggestion!,btohqsg
Ok yes got it! I can‚Äôt use my Amaze already since that‚Äôs been maxed out for the month üòÖ so I might have to use the other shopping platforms instead,btohqsg
I always wait for flash deal or those special date sales  it can save u some extra to spend on other stufd,btohqsg
So fast max out .. spending more than 1 k a month,btohqsg
