I can’t keep up any more,btohqsg
Used to be when we were younger we invented the memes and dumb stuff,btohqsg
Idk old was bedok when he joined as a extra hand in sgexams,btohqsg
He nothing do at 12 isit,btohqsg
Nowadays people slap their inner elbow scream sheesh I’m wondering wtf is that about,btohqsg
In the realm of scientific advancement  we present to you the innovative marvel known as the Holy grail Mark 5. Harnessing the cutting-edge principles of quantum entanglement and advanced particle physics  this weapon transcends the boundaries of conventional armaments.The Holy grail operates by exploiting the inherent wave-particle duality of matter. By inducing controlled fluctuations in the quantum field  it generates a localized quantum singularity within its firing chamber. This singularity  created by the precise manipulation of entangled particles  serves as the catalyst for an unparalleled destructive force.Powered by a miniature Dyson sphere  the weapon channels vast amounts of energy harvested from the quantum vacuum. This energy is carefully channeled through an intricate series of superconducting coils  utilizing an exotic blend of meta-stable isotopes to amplify and stabilize the energy flow. The resulting quantum flux reaches a critical threshold  triggering a catastrophic quantum cascade.The cascading effect  known as the Quanta Reaction Amplification Phenomenon (QRAP)  unleashes an unimaginable release of energy. This energy manifests as a highly coherent quantum beam  capable of tearing through matter at the subatomic level. Its intense wave-packet properties lead to instantaneous molecular destabilization  causing rapid structural disintegration of any targeted object or entity.In order to ensure pinpoint accuracy  the Quantum Disruptor X-27 is equipped with an advanced quantum targeting system. This system employs a network of entangled quantum sensors  operating in multiple dimensions simultaneously. By monitoring the quantum fluctuations in the vicinity of the target  the weapon dynamically adjusts its firing parameters  compensating for temporal and spatial distortions. This guarantees a near-instantaneous strike  eradicating the intended objective without mercy.,btohqsg
We used to Harlem shake and Gangnam style,btohqsg
And msn was the original discord,btohqsg
Lanjiao bedok just spams this in discock also,btohqsg
Damn Wild West sia  I remember unlimited perverts asking me how old I am ASL,btohqsg
I rmb getting scared of Omegle back in 2009  freaking creepy liao,btohqsg
Don't even understand half of the new lingo,btohqsg
I told you man it is too complicated but do you understand now,btohqsg
Not really but I guess it’s some people drama and discord group chats,btohqsg
what’s this supposed to be for context,btohqsg
Saw someone's penis and decided that's enough for the day,btohqsg
Do you rmb the time before Yt was popular? I still remember people had individual flash websites which were super cool,btohqsg
Well the problem wasn't about the size it was about the consent bro,btohqsg
Some hosted games and animations individually,btohqsg
Nope I asked chatgpt for scientific bs for a powerful weapon for a movie,btohqsg
There’s like a Mr octopus who is a chef website  super fuzzy vague memories of that one,btohqsg
I was an early adopter of YouTube tho,btohqsg
But I do remember playing flash games in Facebook a lot,btohqsg
ya i was gonna say it sounds like smth a movie would say,btohqsg
they took a bunch of actual physics terminology and crammed them together,btohqsg
Neopets  RuneScape and flash games of stickers,btohqsg
Going to the grand exchange my dude,btohqsg
i mean they basically just looked up concepts of quantum mechanics,btohqsg
I was there before the GE,btohqsg
I was there when RS2007 was new lol,btohqsg
Ok that one is before my time liao,btohqsg
I was at the end of XP and Vista when I first used a computer,btohqsg
My typing speed correlated with the fact that u needed to spam ur trades offer to sell anything,btohqsg
I am.. just an early adopter of computers,btohqsg
Used my first com at 4 or 5?,btohqsg
idk what my first comp usage was,btohqsg
That one is just you bro,btohqsg
It's too old for us liao,btohqsg
Dial up was phased out around the 2003 2004,btohqsg
Limpeh only 2-3 years old :/,btohqsg
Ya I rmb I was so happy when dialup changed to dsl  no more phone call become no internet,btohqsg
i mean i used it prior to 2006 so sounds about right,btohqsg
This was back when ppl still call landlines,btohqsg
Yeah my first com was in the DSL age,btohqsg
confirm got some 60yo uncle one,btohqsg
Gotta ask your mum not to make any calls while u serve the net,btohqsg
i rmb getting beat up for using comp after sch without permission,btohqsg
Bus no aircon  have to put coins in and take the paper  anyone?,btohqsg
Back then got bus riot or not?,btohqsg
I feel like the gap between 25 and 20 damn big cos of so many changes,btohqsg
