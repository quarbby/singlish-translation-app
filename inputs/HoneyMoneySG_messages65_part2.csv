Cause I thought you should tap the Simply Go card instead of the UOB ONE card üòÖ so I just link my UOB ONE card to SimplyGo and just tap UOB ONE at gantry?,btohqsg
Yes. You don't even need the app unless you're tracking the trips.. or intend to claim when you forgot to tap out,btohqsg
Thanks  Melvyn. Silly me‚Ä¶ I have linked it already. Will just use my UOB ONE for gantries then. Thank you so much!,btohqsg

Hi  I believe Atome follows the mcc of purchase  likely Woosa's mcc,btohqsg
Very curious on how many ppl here think its ok or have bought HDB flat that is 62 years lease left or less? Am wondering if you guys rationalize the purchase considering many people here are interested in investing and FIRE.,btohqsg
What is your purpose of buying the hdb.1. Self consume then is ok2. Want to leave legacy for children - is 62 years remaining lease enough. Do not assume sers.,btohqsg
self consume and stepping stone for condo in future hopefully. and to cash out of current property after MOP and buy a bigger place closer to parents. Unfortunately I don't have the funds for sell 1 buy 2 or even a big condo because for us we need more than 60sqm space.,btohqsg
If u buy a hdb with 60 years left and stay 5-10 years yourself  u will find it very very hard to sell the hdb with 50-55 years left when u want to.,btohqsg
Hdb will always have value forever but must be fully paid,btohqsg
ya thats my worry also  but I see any above 70 years are more than 650k in the area close to parents lol.. Thats why wondering if any financial savvy ppl here choose to buy HDB that has only 60 odd years lease left,btohqsg
HAHAHA  seems that way right!! the price is not going down at all...,btohqsg
Sorry  but fully paid or not does not affect its value,btohqsg
Mainly the newer 80-95 years hdb moving only.The 60 years left ones pricing still in doldrums.,btohqsg
Newer flats are always smaller. You either have to choose between resale value or size. Unless another freak pandemic occurs.,btohqsg
Hello experts  does anyone know if buying the euro rail ticket using DBS  WWMC is an eligible online transaction?,btohqsg
Etiqa is best... they will even message you to remind you on your flight,btohqsg
Once hit 20K  anything extra will not be instant withdrawal.They say try their best hit 3.5% with $MktFunds. But not guaranteed.But then it‚Äôs a bit of a hassle to withdraw everyday  so may be let it accumulate like 2 months for $150 then withdraw one shot invest in other things?,btohqsg

Hi  anyone here use Shopee and pay with installment? I had purchase an item and chose 12mth installment which is roughly $40+ but in my UOB app i still get charged full amount  do I just pay the $40+ amount when it's due?,btohqsg
Anyone got the maribank opening voucher? Can use for any item?,btohqsg
Is senoko app and website down? Cant pay bill for 2 days already,btohqsg
No issue to me. Charged 12mth installment interest free to my OCBC 365. U got to check.,btohqsg
Some maybe due to logistics issue nearby parents so that they can help look after kids. Will still have to buy surrounding areas for convenience.Some are in matured areas with a lease of 60 like AMK  but the centralised location and bigger and squarish layout may still attract those that are willing to pay.,btohqsg
It depends:Single/married/kids?Every one (fresh/under grads )wants to FIRE.But realised it‚Äôs not as easy when they grow older and have more family commitments .,btohqsg
Morning ppl. Is there any link or video for step by step for miles card(citi rewards card) and (uob solitaire) to use on sia flight. And what if each card is use by different person example: husband and wife. Not shared account.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if I but a dining voucher from kris+  will this purchase still considered under dining category?,btohqsg
IMO  for a good real estate investment  whether HDB or private - location  mid to high floor (for non landed)  psf valuation vs surroundings are super important. Will make or break your objectives. Good luck to your decision making,btohqsg
Hello all Is there any credit card that can split my expenses into installment w/o processing or interest fee with the bank not the merchant,btohqsg

UOB one account  the every 3 months over 500/1000/2000cashback is based on calendar quarters? Or just every 3 months from start of account?,btohqsg
I think this is stated in uob one card TnC. You may google ‚Äúuob one card tnc‚Äù to have a look.,btohqsg
u referring to uob one card quarterly rebate? particular 3 statement months  can call uob to check what is your quarter if u are new to the card  if not your quarter is stated on your card statement,btohqsg

if over 55 and exceeded FRS,btohqsg
Then he can withdraw then return me straight away.I got the tax rebate for the year. Any flaw?,btohqsg
Best to check with CPF first. My parents was from MSS time.I asked if I were to VHR for them  how much will be taken for RA and how much to OA. From there   I was able to withdraw all from OA out.So very much depends on urs.,btohqsg
MSS was old plan before CPF Life and VHR is volunteer housing refund,btohqsg
Can I ask if I can get 4mpd for paying dentist in jb with amaze card paired with crwm?ü•≤,btohqsg
Hello  can I check if forex spend for DBS live fresh card counts towards eligible spend for cashback?,btohqsg
Can provide instructions online via the uob app to have principal and interest go to your nominated savings account  no need to go down to the bank.,btohqsg
After 55 topup is to RA  unable to withdraw lump sum. The topup will increase the monthly payout.,btohqsg
https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/retirement-income/retirement-withdrawals/how-is-the-withdrawable-amount-computedFrom my understanding  as long as you still have substantial amount above FRS  and you are not at ERS amount  any amount you topup can be 'withdrawn'. Yes there is a rule that topups cannot be withdrawn  but you are actually withdrawing from the original amount.For example.FRS = $200kERS = $400kWhen you are 56 years old:Your current Retirement Account is $250k (anytime can withdraw $50k cash).Then  your children cash topup $5k to you to get tax relief.You are allowed to withdraw $55k anytime.Please correct me if I am wrong as CPF rules keep changing and I might have misinterpreted the current rules.,btohqsg
