HSBC Revo only awards 10x on whitelist categories,btohqsg
believe i talked about this card multiple times already,btohqsg
Sometimes the best lessons were learnt from mistakes because you remember it so hard that you will not do it again  so yeah,btohqsg
Agree ! Every cents count now so really need to maximise every cashback,btohqsg
Hi Guys  may I check which card top up Revolut card is better? Grab pay card canâ€™t top up anymore..,btohqsg
https://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/promotions/latest-promotions/accounts/casa-sep22-promo.htmlWhat's the catch of CIMB StarSaver Account ? thanks!,btohqsg
Is there a gauge of what kind of non public info there will be?,btohqsg
One good example is how to use up your grabpay 30k limit before 4 apr nerf,btohqsg
CIMB Starsaver not much catch  but you can get better returns with others bank accounts  if you want fuss free SIF Gosaver give higher returns  but if you wanna work a bit  HSBC EGA  Maybank iSavvy  SCB Esaver give better returns,btohqsg
Will there be like a private telegram or whatsapp group for all those members to chat on those course material for further clarification ?,btohqsg
Hi  for citi reward card's points is it instant credit or end of billing month?,btohqsg
A few days will appear in your app,btohqsg
NICE!! signing up now thank youas im new to this CC world so will need alot of guidance haha,btohqsg
I don't think there's any so far. I top up via Google pay. I use a debit card as credit card has a $1.50 charge now.,btohqsg
Hi Chris  using HSBC Rev CC to sign up eligible for 10X rewards? Thank you,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I have bought your course. Looking forward to learn from you. Thanks,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s the best way to pay income tax now?,btohqsg
Any tax guru here? Can we claim motor vehicle license for course fee relief?,btohqsg
If can claim I will claim my class 2A upgrade fees...,btohqsg
I would say just pay in instalments.. in the meantime just keep placing the money in high interest savings accts,btohqsg
Why not quickly use the amex to grab loophole b4 nerf,btohqsg
GPMC can't use at AXS anymore,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGcan I claim this for course fee relief for fy 23?,btohqsg
Use the 'Chat with IRAS' feature on pagehttps://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/individual-income-tax/basics-of-individual-income-tax/tax-reliefs-rebates-and-deductions/tax-reliefs/course-fees-relief,btohqsg
Iirc course fee relief is only for course that relate to your line of work,btohqsg
My job has lots of purchasing needs so require use of CC frequently. I would say this is strong justification for courses relevant to my employment ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
Well  if iras accept this reasoning  i am not complaining,btohqsg
Well that is for next FY claims,btohqsg
Grab Card has a 2% equivalent cashback right now (for $150 spend).,btohqsg
You'd be surprised what the hnw people claim as tax relief that get approved,btohqsg
Even stuff like personal travel expenses and meals,btohqsg
this is fine  cus is reflected as accepted in IRAS website,btohqsg
I am in the miles game for sometime. I thought I knew it all but Chris always surprise me with new miles hack that I am not aware of. Have signed up the course! ðŸ˜ƒ,btohqsg
Like I said if we justify and IRAS accepts who are we to not claim?,btohqsg
but have you read the IRAS page regarding the course fee relief yet? Maybe can help answer your question,btohqsg
No like we are doing illegal stuff,btohqsg
You can try and provide us the DP,btohqsg
Yes I did. 2nd point any course  seminar  conference that is relevant to current employment,btohqsg
So what if it is gray zone SG is famous for loopholes,btohqsg
Even if they end up rejecting the $88 (or more) cost is like a few dollars more of additional tax. Just pay back,btohqsg
Any sign up bonus for these accounts pls?,btohqsg
Please lah  if im iras i also will reject base on this. But you can try then let us know in ACCM,btohqsg
How to go about this ??,btohqsg
true but if it doesnt not move you down a tax bracket I dont see the need to do it tbh ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
One thing I learnt from hnw people is that they don't get rich spending money by saving every cent,btohqsg
Uob one interest cam we draw out without any incurred any with our perk benefit likes on going bonuses?,btohqsg
I just paid for the course fees  now waiting for email hahah,btohqsg
If it is there to be exploited you are very sure all hnw people are going to exploit the tax loophole,btohqsg
definitely  but they are advised by a tax advisor so they can catch loopholes easier  while there is us just digging around and trying the hard way. the sad truth,btohqsg
They can afford private accountants on retainer and probably save much more,btohqsg
