that's probably the only part of me that's worth anything. Coz hardly used.  Low Mileage.,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s something about cars without B Pillars ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°,btohqsg
Not in mass production because it doesn't meet safety criteria,btohqsg
Ya itâ€™s 1 small pillar protruding out from the base,btohqsg
4 seater verts need roll bars behind the seats,btohqsg
If they put reinforcement between the front and rear seat and alsoConvert the Center console + rear console into some reinforced material then maybe could work leh,btohqsg
Why no  all for the sake of a bigger sitting convertible,btohqsg
You go ahead then since since safety is not a word in your dictionary,btohqsg
I see you are taking inspiration from the wise James May,btohqsg
F1 coming soon can just snatch and go  who can outrun you,btohqsg
I never really like the looks for RR leh  just like Mercedes  abit roundish,btohqsg
I prefer the aggressive type of look,btohqsg
But then again I canâ€™t afford it  so no need to think so much,btohqsg
Not if you get the hard top,btohqsg
Then take the whole top off,btohqsg
Looks like truck with a small flatbed  and a panoramic roof,btohqsg
Like that looool the flatbed is basically tiny storage,btohqsg
Hmm around same size as forester?,btohqsg
regular wrangler not the rubicon which is higher,btohqsg
Ah? I saw a few jeeps normal plate though,btohqsg
Rolls Royce SUV also damn ugly but everyone proud to drive it,btohqsg
Toyota Corolla Cross Hybrid GR Sport,btohqsg
Waw look like a RAV4 but smaller!,btohqsg
The auntie makes me not wanna buy it even more,btohqsg
Jeep: SUV  off-road capableGWag: SUV  off-road capableJimny: Mini SUV  off-road capableAll like same only.,btohqsg
You ask then you answer yourself,btohqsg
You think  I thought  who confirm,btohqsg
You mightâ€™ve read the brochure wrong. Try glasses.,btohqsg
Itâ€™s a crossover. Sub compact at that too,btohqsg
So not an SUV technically. More MPV,btohqsg
Maybe you donâ€™t know much about cars,btohqsg
If thatâ€™s not vezel then what car is that,btohqsg
You already said it from beginning no?,btohqsg
Maybe he ask again to confirm,btohqsg
Love how the needles do a sweep whoosh!,btohqsg
We were once there itâ€™s okay,btohqsg
Then what car is it according to you?,btohqsg
It's ok to be wrong at times,btohqsg
I think vezel  so does Pak Mood,btohqsg
I think Tan An Wo agrees with me too,btohqsg
Look like the malaysia brand car forgot the name,btohqsg
Cause they more knowledgeable than us,btohqsg
Nowadays really a lot of vezel on the roads,btohqsg
I wonder if they still have the check lights issue,btohqsg
Some drivers just cut it off completely,btohqsg
So youâ€™re telling me I sold my Lambo Urus last month for a Audi A4? Damnit,btohqsg
I zoom in show you the logo,btohqsg
I see driving on and off the roads before,btohqsg
I send you so many pictures already,btohqsg
Not quite sure about your analogy now,btohqsg
