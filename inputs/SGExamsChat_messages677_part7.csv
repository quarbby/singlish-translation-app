Should have just go with physics,btohqsg
I was very lucky my sec sch offered econs  I dun like the other humanities,btohqsg
What sch were you from if you don’t mind saying,btohqsg
Only 4 schs got o level Econs I think,btohqsg
I feel like take H2 bio then a lot of course in uni cannot take already,btohqsg
Yep  bell curve be my school competing with ourselves,btohqsg
I wanted to do some engineering course,btohqsg
aiya i go home ltr ask my mom since my mom excelled at matj during uni,btohqsg
I heard like in 2020 yall got 100% dist rate for Econs,btohqsg
We literally got consistently ab9e 90% distinction  like only 1 person didn’t,btohqsg
so what if she say i stupid and my brain cannot think deeper,btohqsg
Coz the other 3 schools are Temasek sec  Woodlands and I can’t rmb the last one,btohqsg
I think compete with intl students too but then again since the grades were awarded in Singapore moe could’ve just set their own grade boundaries separate from the UK o levels,btohqsg
Even though we use the same paper as them,btohqsg
Yea it has always been above 90% (my year only 1 person didn’t get distinction),btohqsg
But sadly we can’t tell since moe doesn’t release grade boundaries,btohqsg
At least since uk does I can see the grade boundaries for A* and A for the same paper,btohqsg
Then can have a rough idea,btohqsg
I actually forgot Cambridge exam we needa compete with international  but I mean Singapore always perform better internationally,btohqsg
Yeah  except that the o level Econs paper is the uk a levels version so it becomes a bit iffy,btohqsg
I don’t know whether moe just follows the uk grade boundaries or sets their own,btohqsg
But also uk o levels does not have grade numerical,btohqsg
I feel that doing econs in O level doesn’t necessary give an edge in Jc coz the qns style is also different  but content wise ya  can understand better,btohqsg
It’s just A* A B C,btohqsg
Oh wow I did not know that lmao,btohqsg
I’m surprised your Cher didn’t mention,btohqsg
But that’s the reason why the QP is quarantined,btohqsg
Idk does each country have its own bell curve or international bell curve,btohqsg
Don’t think so for the international paper,btohqsg
But o level Econs in Singapore is unique,btohqsg
Since as far as I know it’s the only paper where we don’t have a local version,btohqsg
And actually econs student population of o level in Singapore is very small,btohqsg
My class has 18 people  but 2 people drop,btohqsg
Yea my cher didn’t say anything about that,btohqsg
Every half a year there are 2 versions of the papers for students in different time zones. The papers are a bit different but since there are some similarities the QPs have to be quarantined to prevent leaks,btohqsg
But maybe that is why econs can only be counted as R2,btohqsg
That is one bad thing about doing econs I think,btohqsg
Coz got me i suffered coz my combine was ss + lit and I bad at both and ended up w a C5,btohqsg
If you search past year o level Econs paper and click the November/December version  you would realise one of the 2 is the one Singapore uses,btohqsg
I didn’t want take geog coz geog + econs is a content bomb,btohqsg
Tbh they should allow econs to be counted as compulsory humanities sia  coz it is really not easy,btohqsg
Unlike Singapore o/a levels the international/uk version isn’t copyrighted,btohqsg
And actually if I had econs as humans 1 instead  I would not be in TM  I would be in ASR lol,btohqsg
I think it won’t be until moe comes up with a harder version of their own lol,btohqsg
But seriously o level Econs is a free A1,btohqsg
Is it not hard already  the content is so much,btohqsg
The mark scheme is too lenient,btohqsg
For o levels? I thought no,btohqsg
Oh yea I got A1 consistently in 2y lol,btohqsg
Even if there is a fair bit of content the markers are so lenient,btohqsg
