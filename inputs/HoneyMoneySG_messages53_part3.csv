Hi gurus  I'm a miles chaser. Can I pay $$ to my wife as rent or something similar using Citi Payall to get the 2.2 miles under the current promo? Thanks for any advice,btohqsg
DBS credit card if your card is just approved but you cancel it without activating your card is it ok?  Because I previously cancelled my card 9 months ago  but to get the reward  I need to be a new card member or have not cancelled the card in the past 12 months.  Will I still receive an award if I apply again after I cancel a new sign-up credit card that has not been activated yet and then applies 3 months later?,btohqsg
I got this shitty error for a long time and it‚Äôs not fixed till today,btohqsg
I got the same error. But applied by sms and approved,btohqsg
Seems like they would reset the clock since your card has already been approved. Maybe try calling or writing in to check with them?,btohqsg
How to trigger the existing account holder promo?,btohqsg
wahh this wan if want to go for the $50k / 7 trades rewards  if one already holding $50k in moomoo fullerton sgd funds  must withdraw all first to bank account then register and re-deposit?,btohqsg
Safer if u withdraw and deposit back coz the requirement is to deposit,btohqsg
I'm also keen to apply for the uob lady's card. Considering the lady's solitaire card  is it easy to get annual fee waiver on this one?,btohqsg
Which credit card should I go for to complement my Citirewards+amaze?I applied to HSBC revo but got rejected somehow (probably paperwork issue).I‚Äôm looking for a card for travel booking expenses with no min spend (as a secondary card only),btohqsg
If there will be pay credited end of the month then this amount of $114 814.81 can be lower? Hmm,btohqsg
They just change their requirements btw,btohqsg
Oh wow I‚Äôm surprised! Thanks for the info  will look into it,btohqsg
it changed just within a week only,btohqsg
Would this card be a better fit than the DBS woman‚Äôs world? I was also looking into it for travel booking but points expire after 1 year,btohqsg
Hi  is there a min for the options trade? Any minimum amount to qualify for the trade? Thanks,btohqsg
May I check if anyone has compared exchange rates between Trust credit card and Youtrip? Are they both competitive  offering wholesale rates?,btohqsg
I think the admin fee has been increased ro 2.2%,btohqsg
Yes. Will go for zero fee and interest 12 month Giro,btohqsg
Uob lady card (travel) spending on Atome-Agoda orAtome-trip.comeligible for the 6miles?,btohqsg
dun think so cos mcc is not travel,btohqsg
not sure about their fees though but Wise is the lowest i have found and I think Trust is 0 but after 2 bad experiences with that bank i have stopped using them,btohqsg
Anyway i have found the ans to my own qn,btohqsg
If you prefer cashback  check this out‚Ä¶https://www.cardup.co/personal/rewards-calculator,btohqsg
Thanks for this information  seems to be valid for existing. Once i confirmed with cso will add it to my video,btohqsg
I guess you are existing card holder. Then sms works for you,btohqsg
But if I want to accrue more from earlier then I should just transfer the full amount now,btohqsg

Hi fam  what is best ‚Äúnext day can withdraw‚Äù money market fund ?,btohqsg
hello  isit possible for me to GIRO my spouse CC bill to my bank account? or it has to be both of the same name?,btohqsg
I believe u can use urs,btohqsg
depends on where you are transferring from and what's the opportunity cost. for ocbc try to target to get exactly 100k average daily balance for best interest rate,btohqsg
One of the banks will reject due to a mismatching signature,btohqsg
Speaking of opportunity cost  trying to work out if I should clock the $500 monthly spend on OCBC credit card to get the extra 0.65% interest vs keeping to spending on UOB lady‚Äôs card for 6mpd,btohqsg
Btw since EGA Aug no more bonus interest we don't need to do the 2k 5 transactions this month correct?,btohqsg
Why not open one account with uob?,btohqsg
For 1% cashback? Don‚Äôt have CC and/or GIRO arranged?,btohqsg
Still kiv. My giro forms have like 7 rejections. CC 6x rejections  IRAS rejected I think 1 or 2x,btohqsg
I have been trying since mar or apr,btohqsg
If I've a 5k spend on a cosmetic surgery would that be considered under hospital/medical and nt valid for clocking of Min $500 spend for uob and ocbc credit cards for the the higher savings i/r for ocbc 360 and uob one account? What is the best way of charging the amounts to get best miles/cashback for such situation?,btohqsg
Now is Jul maybe end of year still nothing approved...,btohqsg
Can use healthhub to pay bill,btohqsg
It depends on the merchant mcc code. If it is public hospital   then Healthhub. If it is other  unless we have more info  we can‚Äôt comment because there are many private cosmetic surgery clinic out there.,btohqsg
Is a separate promo  2k 5 transaction is for everyday plus rewards for 1%  you can still do,btohqsg
Hi  gurus. How is the equivalent cash back for uob lady card if I don‚Äôt want to use the mileü§î,btohqsg
