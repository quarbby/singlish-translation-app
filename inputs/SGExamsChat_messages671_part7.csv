its for hcl and only considered if you applied to a sap school,btohqsg
its been like 2 days ?,btohqsg
for me i got hcl dist so it was +3,btohqsg
new system is if same raw score when applying to sap schs  then consider hcl grade,btohqsg
So 8 (dist) > 8 (merit) > 8 (pass) > 8 (no hcl) > 9 (dist),btohqsg
isit js me or is anyone also confused by the new psle system. esp the distribution of grades lol,btohqsg
new system doesnt have grade moderation though,btohqsg
academics now nt tht impt apparently. Now more to getting kids involved in like being active,btohqsg
al 1 90 and above al2 85 to 89ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
u make careless mistake u drop to next gradeðŸ’€,btohqsg
anyway i prefer the t score system,btohqsg
t score system you can carry,btohqsg
al is like 1 die all die,btohqsg
but tbh i can see why they did away with tscore,btohqsg
But i feel this system makes the kid more worried,btohqsg
Like the score is so much different,btohqsg
that time i was at the pri sch the p6s keep asking me my psle score,btohqsg
each percentage frm al1 to 4 is by a few percent. u fk up u drop to the nxt grade,btohqsg
64 and 45 is such a huge difference,btohqsg
Idk why they wanna change smth that is working well,btohqsg
must well js do away with psle,btohqsg
Also 74 and 65 are miles apart bruh,btohqsg
At first the parents told me their child is al3 i tot b3 ok la,btohqsg
Den i look up its 80,btohqsg
i mean ya obvs but uk,btohqsg
al system the biggest problem is the grade boundaries,btohqsg
two kids get al6 one get 64/100 one got 45/100 there's no way they have the same understanding of the subj but they still get the same grade,btohqsg
what if one day they r like our kids r to stressed lets do away with it,btohqsg
