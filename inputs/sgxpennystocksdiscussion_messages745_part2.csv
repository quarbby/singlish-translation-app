This is the first acquisition that CEO Jonathan Zhang is embarking since he took helm of Vv3 few months back.IMO  this is a very good acquisition for Vv3 as it brings Great Synergy as Elliot & Co have plenty of high profile clients where they could provide vV3‚Äôs VR expertise and digital content creation. With that   we could expect top line and bottom line to increase as the big organisation as shown usually pay top dollars which means good profits tooüí∏Looks like Vv3 is in the hands of an experienced and capable CEO now to help them turnaround and grow to greater heights.Vamos!Source:https://elliotco.sgIntro video (Elliot & Co)https://youtu.be/TO9YmZ4tHMs,btohqsg
