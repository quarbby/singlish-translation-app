Is it good wtf or bad wtf,btohqsg
lmao albus is the name of the cat,btohqsg
rp  during one presentation for my friend,btohqsg
did you put your name in the goblet of fire,btohqsg
in the books and movies is diff,btohqsg
other poly's prob have but not in presentable form,btohqsg
i think the faci's wanted to motivate my friend's cohort,btohqsg
yea ik but im just surprised by some of the min,btohqsg
and what is this guys source?,btohqsg
Omg i hope they do for my cohort cos iw to see for myself the bar to get in,btohqsg
the bar chart in the article,btohqsg
Ok but i did hear the principal talking abt like,btohqsg
i like to call him hairy potato,btohqsg
yea the stats are only for ict students,btohqsg
“DID U PUT UR NAME IN THE GLOBET OF FIRE!!!”,btohqsg
"""The increases came mainly in construction and manufacturing for foreigners""",btohqsg
also this isn't number of jobs created  it's number of people being employed compared to the previous year,btohqsg
the article also attributed slow growth rate of residents employment to a lot of them getting retrenched,btohqsg
and lots of foreigners getting employed is nothing abnormal considering the drop off in2020-2021,btohqsg
i see  anyways i wont be affected for another 4 years..well see how the world is then by that time,btohqsg
i'm just saying this is what happens when people make comments like this without reading things properly,btohqsg
they weren't even sure if residents included PRs when the article literally clarifies it,btohqsg
isit? oh idk then maybe my 5 yr friend is part of that intake,btohqsg
thats why he can stay for 5 yrs,btohqsg
wait so what does that represent,btohqsg
no i know that  what does it mean for results wise,btohqsg
the chances of uni is around the 3.2-3.4? mark for non-big 3?,btohqsg
btw is it only rp or other polys also restructure more than 60% of modules every 2-3 yrs,btohqsg
people that gained admission in uni from2017-2023that graduated from your course,btohqsg
cause my poly redoes whole entire modules every 2-3 yrs..so the mods that someone graduated with in 2017..may have not went through 60% of the modules someone that graduated in 2021 may had,btohqsg
i mean i'm just thinking bc SIT's enrollment per year for every single course added together is 3k,btohqsg
doesn't make sense for 123 of those to come from one major from one poly,btohqsg
like currently  my soi batch is the last batch to be taught in depth java..the module has run for 2+ yrs alr. the new batch is now doing python,btohqsg
they been showing that..heard faci's said multiple times..if exams are too tough  they will relook at the test...if there are very few failures they will recycle the exams across semesters,btohqsg
like no kidding every paper..maybe max will have 5 diff qns,btohqsg
the rest of the 20+ qns are recycled,btohqsg
majority of students are getting C and B overall,btohqsg
anything higher its like a warzone,btohqsg
the idea ive always been saying its the only poly in sg that actually actively takes steps to make sure you pass,btohqsg
no matter what kind of results you are giving,btohqsg
Bro that's what I said. I am from discord lol,btohqsg
YES lmao I told ya u will confirm remember one,btohqsg
Grades calculation for each moduleAssuming daily grade is 6 D’s -600%Daily grades accounts for 30% of overall moduleD being 50-55/100C being 60-65/100B being 70-75/100A being80-100/100Daily Lessons-6(55)/600x30=16.5MSA accounts for 30% of overall moduleMSA-55/100x30=16.5ESE accounts for 40% of overall moduleESE-55/100x40=2222+16.5+16.5=55/10055/100 is D+So this module i would get D+ at the end of semester,btohqsg
At least back in SAS my module chairs told me that they don't la,btohqsg
thats your school  diff school runs with diff system,btohqsg
U are assuming daily grades tho,btohqsg
Some mods run on clustered grading,btohqsg
But the module chair has the discretion for grades,btohqsg
Wait kuro which poly are u in again,btohqsg
No lol some have moderation some don't,btohqsg
