That is not important at this point of time. But worth considering down the road...,btohqsg
It did not state so in the tnc. But clause 11g and 11h makes it vague for all sorts of transactions,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGbtw do you report your YouTube earnings to IRAS?,btohqsg
it's not excluded  ezlink and simplygo are separate things,btohqsg
"Noted but i am referring to the part where they mentioned ""it is not the exhaustive list""",btohqsg
Is it paid in USD is my question because I want to know how to report forex earnings to IRAS,btohqsg
Giving such statements sometimes creates some doubts alrdy not explicited stated :),btohqsg
Paid in SGD. I will convert all USD earnings to SGD based on received date FX rate,btohqsg
that is to cover their own backside  maybank is considered a lenient bank already,btohqsg
u can start to register the new local company name first  may not be immediately approved :),btohqsg
But why not just use Standard Chartered SMART for Simplygo 6% no min spend if you are worried about maybankhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/84198,btohqsg
Yes agree   scb smart is good for take mrt  bus  drink coffee and fast fooe,btohqsg
1 thing I don't understand.  Bros.Icbc bank claims to be the top bank in the world.. but they did not have a air miles card and also don't have 4 miles rewards card.,btohqsg
China citizen does not use credit card as much. They are using more of alipay and weixin pay instead. So overseas branch here  even less emphasis,btohqsg
Last time they did have free 6 dragon pass per cc. Really misses that.,btohqsg
I wonder how is the miles game in China  in Japan it seems quite tough because many places still need cash or suica/pasmo only,btohqsg
The wechat pay is pointless  little points earn,btohqsg
Anyone know if UOB Krisflyer card still gives points with Instarem Amaze?,btohqsg
Is the maybank platinum visa still the best to pay insurance bills? Or are there alternatives around too,btohqsg
Awesome  cause I saw this T&C on the website“W.e.f. 1 March 2022  please be informed that transactions with transaction description “AMAZE* TRANSIT*” will be excluded from the awarding of KrisFlyer miles on the KrisFlyer UOB Credit Card.”And I wasn’t sure if they were referring the Instarem amaze 😅,btohqsg
You can probably find out by attending the Apple AGM and asking Tim Cook,btohqsg
So if I transact let’s say a $10k purchase at CD in Europe for example  will it classify under the 3miles per dollar if I use my amaze card since it’s “online” spending? 😅,btohqsg
Don't have to keep asking  maybe you ask at Twitter is the right channel,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGany cons for immediately registering the PL for GST?,btohqsg
Nobody here owe you a reply. Neither are we working under you or taking your money. Don't be en entitled prick and just Google it,btohqsg
Btw ppl are hoarding cash now not equities due to impending recession so no surprises all equities will go down. Like Tesla also drop like $20,btohqsg
Im not sure about this  but Gst need 1m revenue then need to register,btohqsg
Which is a nice way to say that only goondu buying equities now,btohqsg
Ok I will ask others who know,btohqsg
Less than 1m also can register. Cons is cost of filing gst return if u not sure how to do it,btohqsg
Filing return is free though. But need to spend time to file. Good thing is u get input tax back,btohqsg
Is klook booking considered 'travel' or online in amaze+crmc?,btohqsg
Hi guys Could I check  if u pair the Kris+ with Google pay > amaze card > Citi rewards card  will we get 4 mpd for the rewards card ?,btohqsg
Why match Google pay with amaze card. For me I do it with 4 miles card with Google pay,btohqsg
Because citi rewards don't get anything with googlepay,btohqsg
Oh yes. Only for simplygo need tap base card. Sorry I missed that out,btohqsg
Want to apply for Maybank card but seems like no promo on Singsaver 🥱,btohqsg
If not allow I will just delete it,btohqsg
Grab will raise its platform fee from 30 cents to 70 cents from May 5.https://str.sg/i47C,btohqsg
More hikes lol plus less reward on grabs lololol,btohqsg
and yet the newest ride hailing app Geolah that promises zero comission fees almost always more expensive than grab for me,btohqsg
They need to improve their profitability. Prices will only go up for consumer.,btohqsg
I spent $1069 for month of March for HSBC revolution but the statement stated points awarded only 1071 points only. Is there a miscalculations? Isn’t it suppose to be 10000points for the 1st $1000 spent?,btohqsg
I believe the bonus points would be credited the next statement month,btohqsg
So you can use Kris + pay with Amaze card + Citi rewards and get the for eg 6miles per dollar with Kris + and then 4 miles per dollar with Citi rewards...net 10 miles per dollar?,btohqsg
yes  but google pay only since amaze not support apple pay,btohqsg
Guys isit use local bank cc for overseas trans th rate is shit? I kena Ocbc charge me 1.505 for euro and Citibank charge me 1.458 for euro omg…?,btohqsg
my credit score is ‘GG’ even though i pay my bills fully every month on the day its released,btohqsg
i have only 1 credit card and limit is 9300,btohqsg
