HSBC Upgrades SCI to Buy from Hold  raise TP $2.61 vs $1.68.All eyes on the Investor Day scheduled in May ‚Äì management likely to announce its renewables ambitionsA mix of good underlying FCF generation and additional debt are the likely sources of support for future growthWe continue to use a SOTP method to value the stock. We now value the energy division at a2021e EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.0x (earlier 7.0x)  which is at a slight premium to the 2021e market cap weighted EV/EBITDA multiple of peers (excluding outliers).The premium is to acknowledge that SCI is the only Singapore-based energy company listed on STI. We also update our free cash flow generation forecasts for SCI leading to a lower net debt for 2021e. For the urban division  we use the book value (unchanged).Based on this  we arrive at our revised TP of SGD2.61 (earlier SGD1.68). Our TP implies c36% upside and we upgrade SCI to Buy (from Hold).At our TP of SGD2.61  the implied 2021 PB multiple for SCI is 1.3x  slightly higher than the peers.,btohqsg
