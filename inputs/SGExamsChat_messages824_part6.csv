either extra time or separate room,btohqsg
Anyways need last min no eng paper 2 rip,btohqsg
Bye bye for like an hour lpl,btohqsg
go complete it and tys for other subjects,btohqsg
AA is disruptive if they are incompetent tho,btohqsg
Like cuz u end late if it's at the proximity u can hear the noise of the rest discussing,btohqsg
Should not. But it happening it another issue,btohqsg
AA do bring abt a whole lot of stigma as well,btohqsg
there is classrooms beside school hall?,btohqsg
Maybe i had it big coz i dun openly share my condition and it can easily be judged as EQ problems or retarded fr the outside coz the condition is rather unknown,btohqsg
Usually if u are a school candidate it's just the com lab,btohqsg
Some labs are near to the hall,btohqsg
In fact i only share to the closest of the closest friends and what to expect fr outsiders if my own parents sometimes forget abt this condition and say im a retard,btohqsg
? where did you even get such information or assumptions from,btohqsg
Because I am a AA candidate,btohqsg
My sch the AA rm is damn far away fr the other ppl taking the examâ€¦so noise wasnt really a big problem,btohqsg
anyway there is those metal barricades near exam rooms for my school i doubt students will cross it,btohqsg
The bigger problem was the stigma associated w AA,btohqsg
They do. And they did lmao,btohqsg
TM AA rm was right next to the staff room soâ€¦,btohqsg
Then the students are bad a**,btohqsg
Poly is even worse they put me in the same room as the others just at a corner,btohqsg
Times up everyone basically disrupted me like crazy,btohqsg
I think it just depends on how the schs handles and foresee these problems,btohqsg
??? Like u did the exam tgt w them or what,btohqsg
I do foresee that happening if same room,btohqsg
In the first place  a large portion of people thinks AA gives us advantage when it actually not,btohqsg
It is more of an advantage to cover up some disadvantage,btohqsg
In Uni I basically changed my AA requirements for a strictly separate room,btohqsg
But they just skirt regulations by just not calling the assessments exams,btohqsg
I would hv opted for AA if im not in such a small course when everyone knows everyone,btohqsg
My dad be scolding me for not finishing the papers coz i could hv gotten myself AAðŸ’€,btohqsg
But tbh im glad my parents won the JC debateðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
My parents woke me up  else i may be struggling to finish papers back in jc,btohqsg
I remembered arguing w them for 30min,btohqsg
Ok but this way  the â€˜idiotsâ€™ won the battleâ€¦so i mean glad i did not let the â€˜idiotsâ€™ win,btohqsg
No wonder u cannot finish la walao only can sustain an argument for 30 mins,btohqsg
Coz im not gd w arguing,btohqsg
My parents repeated this many times throughout the argument â€˜i need more mental resilenceâ€™,btohqsg
No u need to get slapped more,btohqsg
My parents beat me to non existence as a kid,btohqsg
help the barricades students crossed that barricade during my n levls,btohqsg
U will learn resilience thru pain,btohqsg
Meanwhile my parents hv completely forgotten abt my conditionâ€¦i need to remind them of it,btohqsg
Yeah those barricades macam suggestions lmao,btohqsg
My parents don't even care about that just beat me senseless can liao,btohqsg
I will probably land myself w a psychologist,btohqsg
I will land myself with jesus at this rate,btohqsg
Until I learnt to fight back or like the pain but yes,btohqsg
No that's just called Asian household,btohqsg
