they aren't supposed to pop and bang like an american school to begin with ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Functionally speaking this is not wrong. Post engine ignition for anti lag is intended. Keyword here is functionally.,btohqsg
stop making up nebulous terms with no actual meaning like 'well tuned na cars',btohqsg
you have no fucking idea what you are talking about,btohqsg
Youâ€™re not talking to each other at the same frequency,btohqsg
learn about what happens during ignition cuts and aggressive overlaps which are inherent to engine design and not nonsense like  'tuned to pop',btohqsg
most of the people here are kids,btohqsg
but purposely adding a pop and bang tune to your NA cat a shitbox doesn't make it cool,btohqsg
well u see a novitec 812 does pop and novitec is a well known tuning company no?,btohqsg
it's like saying a well kept car is more than likely to survive a road trip as opposed to a shitbox beater,btohqsg
U guys arguing over Functionally tuned or public nuisance tuned,btohqsg
it does because it's a performance car in itself,btohqsg
Ya pop and bang is damn XS,btohqsg
theyâ€™re arguing over NA cars popping i think,btohqsg
i was really about to give this kid a hard time but it seems i dont have to now that others are chiming in. dont come in here with your 12 year old 'na cars should not pop' bs. go back to tiktok son,btohqsg
it helps to understand how engines actually work,btohqsg
suck squeeze bang blow. applicable to the bedroom.,btohqsg
quoted here for posterity. one of the most retarded statements ive seen in here in a long time,btohqsg
hi okayama ( val (simracing) ),btohqsg
12 year olds are not supposed to talk about this they know nothing about too but that doesnt actually happen does it,btohqsg
iâ€™ve actually lost the plot of this argument,btohqsg
this is what happens when 12 year old egos start to inflate,btohqsg
too much fucking tiktok rot their brains,btohqsg
they watch a 30 second clip of a 12 year old telling them NA cars are not supposed to pop and suddenly they all up in here telling us how engines are supposed to work,btohqsg
i'm quite sure no car manufacturers makes their car sound like the quiet kid in school,btohqsg
if your car doesnâ€™t have a rpm limiter you can pop one time very loudly,btohqsg
subway surfers gameplay below to reaffirm their point,btohqsg
ah yes. that first decathlon meet,btohqsg
you can't kill a K series,btohqsg
Putting aside the very insightful automotive engineering discussions  i think all agree pop and bang at meets near residential are fked up  tune or no tune. Till we meet again ðŸ«¡,btohqsg
since did you hear me say i money shift the family car,btohqsg
so when are you 9GTronic swapping the R33,btohqsg
what the fuck is 'unless specifically tuned to pop' supposed to mean? This is what i mean when you need to stop making up terms with no meaning. THere are plenty of engines tuned for maximum performance that WILL pop because it is inherent to the design of the engine. You are too far down the dunning kruger curve to even know what you dont know. just stop trying to come across as some sort of authority on this. you have no idea what you are talking about,btohqsg
M series  amg (NOT AMG LINE)  Audi S and RS if they pop and bang still ok cuz they got horse run,btohqsg
terms like 'supposed to' and 'specifically tuned to' are subjective cop out terms and not used by people who actually know what they are doing,btohqsg
and there we go again  keep rehashing the same shit,btohqsg
All of them got standard one not so monotonous and abhorrent pop and bangs,btohqsg
hi  rmb to use when u go see doctor or geng mc,btohqsg
give me biggest racist tag i stop k,btohqsg
They practicing here trying to run for Parliament in 2025,btohqsg
Whe agrees with me on this,btohqsg
Heâ€™s focusing on the nuisance tunes by the NA cars at the local meets here,btohqsg
can 9gtronic swap scirocco or not ðŸŒš,btohqsg
Sometimes the spirit of discussion is more important than winning my brothers,btohqsg
the rocco engine will piang before u swap,btohqsg
just put the nmax cvt ðŸ¥°,btohqsg
need bring back like 30 cartons of gudang garam js to rebuild engine ðŸ’”,btohqsg
If u have driven the CLA / A 45 u know their gearbox is shit,btohqsg
havent driven one but seems like it,btohqsg
They set shift timing too fast that why have fart,btohqsg
