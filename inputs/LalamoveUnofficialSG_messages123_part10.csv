That’s where the drivers are being bullied.,btohqsg
New drivers don't know last time pricing so they did happily,btohqsg
I have a neighbour in my neighbourhood who took off the LLM sticker. Then asked him why  he said not worth it. Just focus on GAB or TAD better. 😂,btohqsg
There’s where they blurr blurr also do.,btohqsg
Riders focus on ROO or PANDA better. Later you all also kena bullied to take Car load. 🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
It is not that easy to setup  customers all know lalamove because we have been advertise lalamove for long time,btohqsg
Anyone knows the meaning of MPV weight<25kg X 2?,btohqsg
Total carry weight not less than 50kg,btohqsg
Is it as much job as LLM on a daily basis?,btohqsg
Not at all  much lesser than llm,btohqsg
Thanks for replying. Comm wise the same? If lesser can still manage to do ft?🥲,btohqsg
2.4 really eat grass liao😭 do 12 hour also cannot guarantee 250-300 a day,btohqsg
Less job n cut price  how to achieve?,btohqsg
Unless you lucky every job got tips $10-20😁😁😁,btohqsg
Total weight of less than 50KG.,btohqsg
My interpretion is - not more than 2parcels  each weight not more than 25kgs. Anyone agree?,btohqsg
Driver’s Perspective - I agreeUser’s Perspective - As long as total weight less than 50KG ( LLM schooled me pertaining to this. ) 🤷🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
If not why they indicate <2 X..... Must jv meaning behind,btohqsg
You’re welcome to question LLM accordingly. If not just oblige their terms & conditions. 🤷🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
Other platform got ixpress and uparcel.Or if u live in west can try amazon flexVia and pickupp dont need bother,btohqsg
Sharing is caring  at least can help fellows here to increase their rightful revenues.,btohqsg
Nowadays more and more jobs no base fare but still people take. Think slowly all jobs no base fare. Can gg earlier,btohqsg
Anyone knows for 1.7M van orders  what kind of orders need customer to engage helper if they do include in the order. What I can think of is very heavy or bulky items that 1 person cannot handle. Any restrictions for quantity?,btohqsg
Van load of their stuff obviously. Big fat tiles (those tiles that's like 30kg each)  fridges (if able to fit.) U name it since its a van order.,btohqsg
Thank you bro for the info  no worries.,btohqsg
And not just grabexpress.. got some other apps u can do instead of lala..,btohqsg
Hahaha  don't mention about Pickup. I rejected this company,btohqsg
I have basically every parcel app I can get my hands on,btohqsg
I didnt even do some of it after registration,btohqsg
Now I only focus on llm but they disappointed me,btohqsg
Well it's like that now lo.. what to do,btohqsg
Just saw one llm passenger. Can ah?,btohqsg
But IKEA there do allow it.. somehow 🤷,btohqsg
I think it’s coz of the drivers’ there that spoil market.,btohqsg
And those there are WP holders. GUARANTEED!,btohqsg
No uh got full crew there on standby under lala one.,btohqsg
I saw one time  he took out his phone. And behind it was a work permit card. 🤔,btohqsg

Cos that one cfm part time de,btohqsg
Sooner or later all will be run by permit   market spoil liao,btohqsg

Cannot brain how some 1.7/2.4 job requires 2 helper. Where got van usually bring 2 helpers the whole day👀,btohqsg
Llm will be happy with them around,btohqsg
Is it a must to call every customer once accept order?My order kena cancelled when I already reached there. From acceptance order until arrive less than 20min. Live chat with LLM agent say no compensation because I didn't call customer. Even I show photo of my pickup point and time,btohqsg
Nth u can do. Llm expect us call every single customer,btohqsg
If u do 20 orders 1 day  1 month u need call 600 times,btohqsg
They expect our phone bill free,btohqsg
Even if they compensate u money  its only a bit only,btohqsg
If I call and customer never pick up or confirm on phone but still can rl. Then how,btohqsg
