As long as you start spending in one category  you need to meet min 1k spend.,btohqsg
Must $1000 in local or overseaCannot mix together,btohqsg
May j in know what is cash advance?,btohqsg
hello everyone i am new here. Just want to ask for those who buy shares using moomoo or webull ? Or both ?,btohqsg
Or using any bank securities ? Like HSBC or UOB,btohqsg
Which is good for long term holding shares,btohqsg
depends on which country? SG/HK/US/?For SG / SGX  if you only buy in smaller amounts  may be cost effective to use custodian broker (they own your shares on your behalf) like moomoo/webull/tiger  then maybe once a year transfer out to CDP.For CDP  cheapest fees is use DBS Vickers cash upfront mode to BUY and FSMone to SELL (DBS Vickers and FSMOne is linked shares stored in CDP)Other countries one I dunno,btohqsg
Is it better to have both moomoo and webull app for buying shares?,btohqsg
For me so far still not yet. Already spend close to 800 for this coming statement. Still at 800plus. Once it jump will update here.,btohqsg
Depending on when your transactions are posted.,btohqsg
My statement just begin on 19th. So it will be affected with the “blip”. So yea. Once its in  will update,btohqsg
From what I know  there are 2 types of trust cards. Mainly credit card & debit card. Different reward system for both cards. Need to know which card u holding & if u are a Fairprice member in order to know which reward system u are in,btohqsg
Depends on where u spend  if u not spending at Fairprice Group. It's 0.22% cashback in Linkpoints not cash,btohqsg
Thanks a lot for the detailed explanation,btohqsg
But if mainly using for over seas spend then  it’s just 0.22% I guess?,btohqsg
Yup! Tried using in JB  rate not bad & can withdraw cash (Subjected to their bank if they want to charge for withdrawal),btohqsg
hi can anyone help to clear my mind for this - cpf SA 4% interests yearly  is it worth to place funds in fixed deposit for 3.8% in just 3 months ?,btohqsg
3 months i get 3.8% compare to 1 year in SA,btohqsg
What FD gives 3.8% returns in 3 months ?,btohqsg
Please tell me where to find 15.2% p.a. I also want to invest,btohqsg
ummm that is not how compound interest works,btohqsg
I think it’s 3.8% p.a for 3 months period,btohqsg
I only see this for FDs also 🤪 I need to know where's the 15.2% p.a. FD from. 🌚,btohqsg
correct me if im wrong 3.8% vs 4% u alr lose out isnt it?,btohqsg
I think he thought will get 3.8% returns in 3 months vs 4% a year,btohqsg
But pls do share if really can get 3.8% returns for 3 months.,btohqsg
SA go in cannot come out,btohqsg
FD still can touch if you really need  so have to see what's your end goal,btohqsg
Oh i think you are right  3.8% p.a for 3 months.....may i know what this means ?,btohqsg
Annum is 1 year which is 12 months. So basically you only get 1/4 of 3.8%.,btohqsg
3.8% * 3/12 is what you'll get,btohqsg
I just posted about 6.8% p.a. for 31 days this afternoon only (Pinned message),btohqsg
May i know how is this calculated? Let say i put in bank $5000 ?,btohqsg
Your interest will be 5000 × 3.8% × 3 ÷ 4,btohqsg
Hi  Can I check for Citi+Amaze  I need to use the Amaze card to pay for my local and overseas transactions. I will earn 10x mile points?,btohqsg
Oh now i get what you mean.....then is really dont touch SA better,btohqsg
yeap SA is now giving 4.08% so its even btr,btohqsg
Can that be used for OA funds ? Maybe can consider for OA,btohqsg
Never ever touch SA unless you have guaranteed 4.1% to invest in..,btohqsg
Yes. Amaze converts spending to online local spend. Citi Rewards gets 4mpd (10x thank you points) for eligible online spend.  Travel- related MCCs and mobile wallet excluded.,btohqsg
Oh i see......thanks for clearing my mind........wow my calculatuons sucks hahaha,btohqsg
Yes if you have short runway  put in 3.8% FD is good for OA which is only 2.5%.,btohqsg
You bought your Rolex from AD  or from grey market shops from Far East those ?,btohqsg
Arh ok. Couldn't get from AD  so thought of using Manhattan card up to $6667 from grey market  but duno if their merchant code will qualify for the Cashback or not. If no Cashback  then will lose $ coz they charge 2.5% for using credit card.Also  I just found out that StanChart no longer offer Manhattan card. Saw from their website. So also not sure if the high 3% Cashback still valid or not for existing card holder. If anyone used it recently  so share and confirm. Thanks,btohqsg
yes... loyal SCB Manhattan card holders continue to enjoy  and will get card renewed  3% cashback min spend $3k  max spend $6.67k.,btohqsg
Need to do options already.easily 10% per month (rolling wheel  selling cover put and calls) but have higher riskOtherwise can do sideway strategies like butterflies and condors,btohqsg
i think investments are not comparable to cash alternatives.Many people do both.Investments using money they can loseCash alternatives for their emergency funds,btohqsg
Knowing which MCC code which merchant belongs too is really a headacheIs there any site with a consolidated merchant code?,btohqsg
heymax doesnt have a lot of MCCs  best is to use DBS DigiBot or Amaze,btohqsg
Can share which mcc is not in heymax?,btohqsg
I was checking for Sleek’s MCC,btohqsg
Yes! But it doesn’t show up on my app,btohqsg
Heymax app? It's just an in app browser  don't think there's any difference.You're better off just setting a bookmark to their site on your home screen,btohqsg
Can you earn max miles with shopee app if you claim any coins/vouchers in your shopee order?,btohqsg
Hey all  does anyone know the answer to this? Curious as well  thks!,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword “Revo mrt” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Can I double confirm if I can use CRMC directly to pay telco (StarHub) via their StarHub App and still earns 4mpd? No need to link to amaze right? Did a search on past chats and found this but wanna double confirm.. thanks 🙏🏻,btohqsg

Hi admin and members. Can recommend me a card that give highest cashback for grab wallet top-up?,btohqsg
Only 1 card which is uob absolute cashback,btohqsg
My solution is use uob acb to top up grabpay wallet  then use hsbc ega to giro pay the bill of uob acb. Then you will get total 1.3% cashback on topping up grabpay wallet.,btohqsg
"Has anyone withdrawn SGD from IBKR recently? I noticed they stated a SGD40 ""Other Estimated Fees"". That's new and is it just a projection or was it really charged? Thanks!",btohqsg
Wow. 2 mths ago i did no such fee. But 1st withdrawal per mth is free anyway,btohqsg
Regulatory Disclosure and Receipt screen. After u do the verifications.,btohqsg
I chatting with IBKR now.. asking if that is just 'projected' to be charged by the recipient bank  or CONFIRMED will charge.,btohqsg
exactly  first time i am seeing too,btohqsg
ok expanded screenshot. TLDR: should be ok  just a cover S SGD40 fee stated. Should not really be charged.,btohqsg
sorry i had to censor the left bit.. user names,btohqsg
thanks for this.. guess they finally decided to cover their S for SGD withdrawals too,btohqsg
now I'm scared to put in another $4000 this month,btohqsg
SNACK is by NTUC.. i won't be worried about their credit worthinessbut it might be some technicalities like PAYNOW not done properly  account number error.. etc.,btohqsg
Don’t need to be scared so much la. If so scared don’t put In anything that uses the word ‘investing’. No one lied to you or force you put money saying capital guaranteed. Just wait another 7 days. You should get your momey in paynow,btohqsg
When you login to Snack  does the fund still showing value?,btohqsg
Hi  my due date for SC card is today and giro not deducted yet from EGA. It’s 6.30 pm alr  there’s no notification of any successful/unsuccessful giro. Anyone has similar experience?I trf in the funds to EGA today early morning,btohqsg
It stated 7 business days for withdrawal and they have exceeded their own timeframe but I’ll wait,btohqsg
SC deducted 1 day before this month for me. So you missed it yesterday. Pay via FAST,btohqsg
I see. Will this be the standard from now on? Coz in the past it was never like this,btohqsg
best to fund your EGA a bit earlier in the future. not worth to squeeze that 1-2 days of extra interest...for late fees headache,btohqsg
Hello admins and all  newbie here. can I ask for UOB One account  salary $1600 criteria.Is it possible to transfer from another bank account and then re-transfer the amount back to my other bank account. Will that hit the salary criteria? Or need to keep the amount in UOB account until the interest payout. Thanks,btohqsg
From the reddit post  apparently this has been the case since 2021 😂,btohqsg
Yup you’re absolutely right. This statement is a large amount  but yeah learned my lesson,btohqsg
I read dbs has current promo on agoda@7mpd.. please check out their t&c,btohqsg
Thanks Richard  so I can transfer back the amount immediately to my other bank account?,btohqsg
maybe not within the day. make sure that in the uob app.. salary has been 'checked'..,btohqsg
i nirmally 'transfer' around end of month.. then transfer out following 1st few days of the succeeding month,btohqsg
Would buying ntuc  e-voucher counted towards uob one account credit card spending requirement,btohqsg
at least for SGD  i can confirm it has NEVER been the case for August 2023 and earlier.. i do regular withdrawals..only today January 2024  I first noticed this SGD40 possible fee comment .,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword “Uob salary transfer” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Did you check the bank account you monitoring is indeed tied to the NRIC paynow? Paynow via NRIC and paynow via HP can be 2 different accounts/banks.,btohqsg
I checked and is tied to a single bank account,btohqsg
Hi guys   I looked OCBC 360 and Singsavers card spend exclusion and they have something called extension payment plan. Is this refering to function like Atome or Cardup?,btohqsg

I see thank you guys 😁,btohqsg

is ibkr safe?  the security not that tight,btohqsg
Is it me or all the cards are starting to nerf 1 by 1.From Altitude to CRMC+amz to this DBSWW to ladies,btohqsg
That's how it works.. when they have hit the target  they will start to do small nerfs until another card overtakes it's place and they will decide to buff it up again,btohqsg
hi all im currently holding citi reward + amaze combo  and my monthly spend is usually 800 ~ 900 which is nice for this combohowever  every other month i’d have a larger spend like shoes/electronics etc  may i know what credit card i should go for to complement citi reward amaze combo?looking for something without montly min spend  will be nice if it covers public transport/traveling. no preference over miles or cashback. income not qualified for uob lady solitairethanks in advance!,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website also proposes a list of best credit cards to use. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg

ummm i enjoy using it though esp their 6mpd promos,btohqsg
Privi miles offer 1.4mpd for such a high spend,btohqsg
However if u got the Ladys Solitaire card u can make use of their 6mpd for up to $3k promo now,btohqsg
Anyone know how strict Lady Solitaire Card is for $120k pa?,btohqsg

Hmm mine took about 3 days to withdraw and arrive in my account t,btohqsg
Quite risky in my opinion as:1. Subscription fee (3%) and management fee (1% p.a.) are pretty high.2. It was only launched on 16 Nov 2023  so no real track record to reference.3. The up to 6% monthly distribution may be made out of income  capital gains and/or capital. So to be clear  6% distribution doesn't mean 6% returns  as it could be selling the capital to be able to pay the 6% (similar to what happened tohttps://www.income.com.sg/funds/asian-income-fund)Additionally  based on what they're saying as which assets go into their portfolio  I don't see how they can offer 6% real growth  even simply just looking at the backtest:* Singapore REITS as an overall market has been flat over the past 10 years* STI has been flat over the past 10 years* Rest of Asia has been about 8% but it can only make up max 20% of their portfolio,btohqsg

Anyone recommends getting scb rewards + ?,btohqsg
I would still recommend the majority to have this thinking:Split your Assets into 2 piles:1. Investment (can lose) = go do riskier investments that can make or lose money.2. Emergency Funds (cannot lose) = only put into safe investments like SSBs  Tbills  Fixed Deposit. That have close to 0 chance to lose money. To be clear  I do not consider webull / moomoo and the like in this category.What proportion of Investment vs Emergency Funds depends on your own household needs  but as a suggestion  it could be 80/20.,btohqsg

Hi all  I'm trying to start investing approx $300-$500 per month. I have existing account with Moomoo & Tiger Brokers.What are some of the app you would recommend for monthly DCA  and what stocks do I look out for (hoping to purchase with fractional share option since i may not be able to buy the entire share with these small amount of money)?,btohqsg
Hi all  just to check I do not have a UOB one account. If I open now thru online will have up to $68 cash? But what is the criteria?,btohqsg
as what@MelvynEzisaid  what does the tnc say?,btohqsg
In fact this chat have many parts of tnc that are summarised already  people just don't want to search lol,btohqsg
Do you have an idea of what stocks you’re open to considering/buying? Or maybe what sectors of the market are you familiar with?,btohqsg
I'm considering between tech  FI and green energy stocks. AAPL  TSLA  C. And maybe ETFs but unsure which to start with for ETF,btohqsg
Does amaze still work with uob krisflyer for contactless spend? Given the latest saga with citirewards,btohqsg
The giro criteria is there any workaround rather than set-up from a payment?,btohqsg
At 300-500 a month  i would not spread too much across different stocks/etfs and just consolidate to one single broad based index fund e.g. S&P500  MSCI World or FTSE All-world,btohqsg
Sidenote: 13 min to SC Flash Deal for Dyson Airwrap!https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/167269,btohqsg
Just out of curiosity  why would that be the case?Cause for example with $500 USD  I may purchase 2 AAPL / TSLA stock  while the remainder gets to go into an ETF like the ones you mentioned,btohqsg
And if these get done on a monthly basis  with rotation of stocks purchased (AAPL / TSLA / AMD etc). I'm diversify my stock purchases with DCA in mind while still purchasing S&P500.Are there other factors I missed if I do it this way?,btohqsg
This should be the default answer for 90% of questions posed here,btohqsg
If I’m reading your plan correctly  it means that in the long run your strategy is about 70% made up of individual stock picks  and about 30% broad market ETFs?,btohqsg
Short term plan  likely that way. Eventually I would like it to be 50-50  but ETF like S&P500 is too big for me to start purchasing it as 1 unit,btohqsg
Unit size isn’t really an issue  plenty of platforms around that offer fractional buysBigger question is what is your “ideal” allocation,btohqsg
As time passes  my income will be higher thus easier to pump money into ETF in future context,btohqsg
That's true too  that's why seeking the general concept in here to see how do you guys allocate the funds when starting outIdeally it would be a 50-50 or 50-40-10 (ETF-Stocks-Crypto),btohqsg
This plan seems to be reducing the diversification if you gonna purchase stocks that is already is in s&p 500. Like adding weight to the stocks.,btohqsg
I had that thought too  but S&P500 picks the top 500. The stocks I picked are just my novice perspective of booming blue chip stocksI do have bias opinion on other stocks like NIO too,btohqsg
But now trying to get general concept and finding out how the thought process is like,btohqsg
Just food for thought is after all that is this really diversificaiton when but mostly still in US stocks/US involved assets.I mean maybe more spread out in terms of industry  but wonder if any shifu here got any thoughts about investing in other countries other than the US?,btohqsg

Hi guys  can citi payall setup to pay for utilities (SP) and season parking (HDB)? When i tried  it prompted for the bank account of the recipient which i cannot find online?,btohqsg
How I see it is  the baseline is whole world stock index. Then from there you can make modifications depending on your economic outlook.- If you focus on US stocks  then your outlook is that moving forward  US stocks will continue to outperform the rest of the world.- If you purchase individual US stocks  then your outlook is that moving forward  these specific stocks will continue to outperform not only the rest of the US stock market  but also the rest of the world.- Same as above if you make yourself overweight on market factors (small cap  mid cap  growth  value  dividend  etc),btohqsg
This is under utilities.. need bank account number?,btohqsg

Hi guru  Is telecom like starhub n M1 online payment consider online spending for UOB evol card to hit the $600 spending ?,btohqsg
Since you're starting out  you might as well just buy either the ETFs that tracks the S&P500 or the All World Index (MCI / Ftse).Since these indices already contain AAPL  TSLA you will capture their growth.You can think about it like fishing. Youre a beginner fisherman  you have a pond. Would you instantly try to go for that 1-3 big fish (individual stock pick)? OR would you cast a net and get the average of the whole pond (ETFs that tracks indices).Nowadays  buying fractional shares of ETFs are quite common,btohqsg

What is the CPF supercharge advice for this profile:Age 41 this year and currently have the following:OA $205KSA $80KMA $71.5KMade recent top up of $6K to MA after seeing honey money sg video  hence MA is full BHS.Should do RSTU or transfer from OA to SA next or don’t do anything since 41 already?RSTU will reserve funds which later cannot be shielded. OA to MA transfer cannot use tax relief.What should be done? Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Assuming you haven't done RSTU before  you can top up ~$8k to your SA for each of the next 3 years (to save on taxes) and itshouldland you right at $40k reserved amount at 55 (unclear if your $6k to MA was last year or this year  this will affect how much tax deduction you get from topping up your SA this year).If you don't anticipate using the OA for housing or anything else down the line  then you should seriously consider transferring from OA to SA to earn that additional interest.Doesn't need to be one or the other  you can do both RSTU and also transfer OA to SA  as long as you don't hit the FRS.,btohqsg
Not sure if my info is updated lol.. just received email from dbs . Women card monthly capped will be amended to 1.5k,btohqsg
Actually that is a good workaround if you scared fund value will drop too much. Shall try that next time,btohqsg
Why so pessimistic. Fund can go up too,btohqsg
You have a lot of options.Maxing out MA + growing SA?1. If you need the full 8k tax relief  continue to VCMA to BHS  and RSTU the remaining (8k - VCMA) yearly till SA monies hits cap (FRS).2. If you don't need the full 8k tax relief and want to keep it simple  just VCMA to BHS yearly.3. If you don't need the full 8k tax relief but want to be optimised  continue to VCMA to BHS  and RSTU the remaining (8k - VCMA) yearly  stop RSTU once you hit 40k reserved SA monies.Growing your OA1. If you need to use your OA monies in the near future (<5 years)  invest into FD/T-Bills. As long they are above 2.5%  they will always be better than leaving them untouched.2. If you don't need to use your OA monies in the near future (>5 years) and have a higher risk appetite  invest into ETFs through platforms like Endowus. Higher risk portfolios may be better to stay invested for at least 10 years.3. If you don't need to use your OA monies in the near future (>5 years) but you have a low risk appetite  transfer your OA monies into SA. 2.5% becomes 4.08%  but this is irreversible!NEVER EVER1. Consider investing your SA monies. Nothing comes close to a risk free 4.08%.,btohqsg

I think it’s very individual depending on your needs.Some of the factors to consider are:Annual Fee (if there’s no annual fee then why cancel?

Personally I feel hsbc revo and uob ppv are a great combo if your total online+contactless spend <=2.1K,btohqsg

Hi guys  need to ask your advise. How does credit card systems work ? Recently I made payment to GE  insurance premium on their GE eportal. The transaction was successful. The transaction show up in my Maybank cc as posted after 5 days. Usually only 2 days.I called up maybank cso why did the transaction posted only after 5 days. They replied that GE called for payment late. Thats why Maybank pay them late.I called up GE cso why GE call for payment so late. GE says  Maybank delay. GE received payment on the spot when I made payment on their eportal.In this situation  whose fault ? Anyone able to advise ?,btohqsg
Usually approve? It apply to all card in same bank?,btohqsg

Hi all  I am a little confuse with the UOB rising dragon promo. Can someone advise me if my plan is correct. Currently only have $5 in my UOB one accountStep 1 - Apply for a Stash Account on 27/01Step 2 - Participate in Rising Dragon 28/01Step 3 - Transfer $100k + $5 to Stash account on 1 FebStep 4 - Wait for 4 months until 1 June and withdraw the moneyIs that correct? Coz I saw the tnc mentioned fund will be earmarked until 17 June,btohqsg
It always depends on when the merchant (GE in your case) actually clears the payment. And usually most payments won't be cleared during the weekends/PH.,btohqsg
What does it mean by participating deposit date? Does it mean I can transfer the fund into uob account anytime within this period and earmark end date will be the same?,btohqsg
1. How much did you have on 30 Dec  1030pm?2. With the above amount  +100k to whichever account you registered with for earmarking.3. Earmarked monies will only be available AFTER the earmarked end date.4. Why don't just register for Jan period? The month haven't end.,btohqsg
1) $5 balance in UOB one acct on 30/122)  $100k to newly opened Stash account3) Understand there is 4 months earmark period4)  What does it mean by register for Jan period? Meaning register for Rising Dragon now? When do I need to transfer the fund in?,btohqsg
You sent the table in the previous message... It's pretty clear if you ask me 🤔,btohqsg
Isn’t it stated in the first column of the table,btohqsg
Thanks for your advise. What will happen if I transfer the fund in on 28/01 instead of 1/2? Any diff?,btohqsg
Your cash credit and earmarked date will be different lol,btohqsg
So you plan to register for Feb instead of Jan? LolIf you prefer to get the cash credit and unlock your monies 1 month later  no one's stopping you...,btohqsg
The quesrion is why?The rest is saying fatser sign up faster get earmark faster get credit why dragSign up on 28. 01 can top up by 28.01.,btohqsg
But why not put in your UOB One account instead? I assume you didn't earmark any monies there if you're asking these questions...A 5% EIR would be better than 3% EIR too.. and $5 fall below fee for UOB One account is more than then $2 fall below fee for UOB Stash account as well.. not sure if you're going to keep 1k into UOB One considering you've left it empty for almost a month already...,btohqsg
A lot of questionable decisions but you do you... 😅,btohqsg
Best is to register for Jan and teansfer the fund in right away? But 17 May earmark date is less than 4 months from today.,btohqsg
Did this affect you in anyway?,btohqsg
Read and confused so have to seek advice😅,btohqsg
Less than 4 months? Depends on when you transfer  if count till so detailed of the days need to be exactly 4 months later  everyone earmarked date will be different,btohqsg
I mean isn't that to ur benefit.Its like say sign up on 1st earmark  date is 17th mroe than 4 monthOne thing it's going to be affected will be that month interest as ur daily banalmce will not be 100k,btohqsg
Just follow what the table says...1. Deposit 100k before 31 Jan 1030pm  register your UOB One account instead of your UOB Stash account...2. If you still haven't open the UOB Stash account  don't open it anymore. But if you have already opened it  deposit 1k by the end of 6th month to prevent the fall below fee if you intend to keep the account for whatever reason..3. If you don't intend to keep it  close it on the 7th month before the fall below fee happens.,btohqsg
My thought is if you are NTUC member and have been buying groceries from NTUC  you can go for Trust account with max 3% pa. The good thing is the interest covers until 500k. It gives flexibility to deploy your funds around and still earn reasonable returns.,btohqsg
If you put in the 100k in Feb  you won’t even get this month’s interest,btohqsg
Can go for GXS or maribank but at 2.x %. Or even syfe 4% for 3 months,btohqsg
For myself I'm going to register on the 31 st Jan and put in on  31st Jan get earmark  and credit on 29th Feb and end the earmark on 17 mayI think for ur case will be semilar to me,btohqsg
But if you have already registered or still decide to register your UOB Stash account for whatever reason  you need to prevent the fall below fee on your UOB One account..1. If your UOB One account is still within 6 months of opening  deposit 1k by the end of 6th month.2. If it's already past the 6 months of opening  deposit 11kTODAYto prevent the fall below fee.I don't see any reason for you to prioritise the UOB Stash account over UOB One account.. unless you prefer 3% over 5%?,btohqsg
If I put $100k on 31/01  what will be my MAB if my balance from 1-30 Jan is $0?,btohqsg
1. Have you opened your UOB Stash account yet?2. Have you registered for the Rising Dragon promo yet?,btohqsg
Yes. Bcos they post late. I lost $70 cash back from quarterly Maybank platinum visa.,btohqsg
Oof.. maybe next time pay earlier lol,btohqsg
I made the payment on Tuesday 2.45pm on GE portal. GE post the transaction on Sunday,btohqsg
The problem is I paid on 26  which is 5 days in advance. And its a Tuesday,btohqsg
Was it the Christmas week? Sunday still within the calendar month tho..,btohqsg
Nope. I remember  its Sep 26. Tuesday.,btohqsg
Ohh. Then it's not within the calendar month anymore. That's unfortunate.. just pay a week earlier lor  better to just pay and don't think about it. $70 lesson I guess.But not bad that they still give you $30 since they only brought in the $300 tier in Oct 😅,btohqsg
Sigh .... This shows how incompetent the GE cso. Write in letter of complaint also no use. Becos its the same people who answer my phone call and email. 😡😡😡,btohqsg
No use to complain la.. you cannot say they do anything wrong because their main job is to give you insurance coverage not to help you get cashback lol.Just pay earlier lor.,btohqsg
Tbh the CSO also cant help you on this. This is under finance dept. +1 to what melvyn said above as well,btohqsg
Um that was 2 questions I asked but ok... lol,btohqsg
But if you want to know the amount  assuming you only have 100k and it's deposited on 31 Jan  it's 3225.80.,btohqsg
Karlssomehow telegram's own moderation removed your question regarding OCBC salary transfer to UOB One account. Have already reported it as false positive.You can find your answer here:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/164384,btohqsg
I already fulfilled minimum salary 1.6k and 1k spending on uob one account . Will it better for me to put in  another  100k today or wait till 31st jan 23 ?,btohqsg
What’s your purpose of putting in another 100k?,btohqsg
$1k per month for 12 months.,btohqsg
I have available 100k cash  to put in . So any advice ?,btohqsg
Does your uob one already have 100k?,btohqsg
No yet.only 1.6k due to the salary credit.,btohqsg
You can put in the 100k now to hit the max cap and get the 5% interest every month but not sure if you’re eligible for the rising dragon promo.,btohqsg
Im unable to hit that as my spending is also spread across other cards  is there another card you could recommend that’s more lenient on min. spending?I also have the dbs women world card  are they more lenient on minimum spending amount before having waiver?,btohqsg
If your 100k is currently in a bank account that gives more than 3.85% p.a.  deposit the remaining amount (100k - whatever is in your UOB One account) on 31 Jan.Else  just deposit it in today and get 3.85% p.a. on 11.1k. If you want to hit 100k MAB this month  you'll need to deposit 1m30k in  so no point to do so.Next month onwards you can get the 5% p.a. on 100k and transfer out the interest given each month.You can also opt for the Rising Dragon promo this month as long as you deposit 100k more than what you have on 30 Dec  1030pm.,btohqsg
Hi all can I know what 4mpd miles card to recommend for offline/contactless transaction that is lenient on annual fee for less than $1k spending/month? I wanted hsbc revolution but it doesn’t cover certain big ticket items like medical expense/dental,btohqsg
4mpd cards don’t cover medical though,btohqsg
Uob ppv covers right? Based on heymax. But just now someone mentioned need at least 1k spend per month to waive annual fee,btohqsg
currency my UOB bank account only have 1.6k. My 100k is in another bank account.So what you are saying   to deposit this 100k only on 31st jan ( it will be posted for 1st day of feb to get 5% PA)haha dun think i will want hit 100k Mab this month   like what u said   need to be 130k.,btohqsg
UOB quite easy to waive. Never spend much also can waive one. Yea PPV will cover as long as it’s Contactless but limited to $1100 a month,btohqsg
Don’t think so leh… 8011 is doctor & physician  8021 is dental.I don’t see it at the selected online purchases eligible for 4MPD,btohqsg
1.03m not 130k lolAnd yes  just deposit on 31 Jan and forgo this month's interest.,btohqsg
im referring to in person though  go see doctor and dental using contactless not online payment,btohqsg
If tnc says MCC not in excluding then it's okay. Just need to remember mobile contactless vs visa contactless.,btohqsg
U can try Uob evol. $600 per month spend.They advertised as long as u make 3 transactions a month. No annual fee.,btohqsg
im looking for miles card thats why 😢 im wondering if they will be lenient to waive uob ppv fee if i also uob lady's and both cards combined have $1k spend per month?,btohqsg
But if u didn't spend 600 on Evol but u spend 500 on uob one card will u still get the cashback & uob one u interest,btohqsg
Yeah uob one card is good for Uob one account,btohqsg
Can try loh but not guaranteed.,btohqsg
Butt if u stack uob one & evol wil. U still get cashback? If u dint spent 600 on Evol,btohqsg
Hi all  wanted to ask if Citi Reward will be considered online pay if paid by Apple Pay? Or is there any alternative! Thank you!!,btohqsg
Back to the main question  what does the tnc say? 😉Considering you asked the same qn 3 times  doubt you actually have read it. So here's a quick extract for you:1. UOB One account bonus interest: $500 total spend on eligible cards2. UOB EVOL card cashback: $600 total eligible spend3. UOB One card cashback: $500 / $1000 / $2000 total eligible spend,btohqsg
Hi all  UOB PPV for Xnap can earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
What does the TNC say? Have you tried checkingheymax.ai?,btohqsg
I read somewhere saying xnap is mobile in-app payment. So is it considered online txn?,btohqsg
Hi all  if you're planning to invite others into this group  please give them the invite link (t.me/HoneyMoneySGor@HoneyMoneySG) so that they will see and respond to the captcha 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Not sure if im reading it correctly but ppv is for mobile contactless and online spend. So xnap dosent fall into both categories?,btohqsg
Right. So other payments via online payment methods are considered online spending.,btohqsg
Wdym? My question is whether xnap considered online? I dont think my question has been answered,btohqsg
XNAP is an online payment method lol,btohqsg
But why is CRMC on Xnap not awarded bonus points?,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword “Xnap crmc” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
does anyone got experience dealing in structure certificate launch by sgx?,btohqsg
The tnc spelt the exclusions out quite clearly,btohqsg
I am here asking my questions bcos i still dont understand the tnc. If u are here to be sarcastic then u might as well stay quiet,btohqsg
Can someone explain me if this is correct.According to shell website and UOB web  it stats that for UOB One card customer  we are entitled up to 17% upfront discountAka:5% station discount5% shell member discount7% UOB One Card discountBut according to the receipt it’s only 14%Am I misunderstanding something here,btohqsg
Additional of 5% if we hit the 2000 monthly spend but I understand that isn’t reflected over here,btohqsg
anyone knows if i cant get annual fee waiver for dbs/uob  can i simply cancel and stop using their miles card with no penalty and just transfer all miles out? cos i heard before sometimes they would take your UNI$/dbsmiles if you dont pay annual fee,btohqsg
Kinda ironic lol  people answered your question clearly,btohqsg
I think coz the cashback only in place if there’s a spend of 2000 and min 5 transaction  so it wouldn’t have appeared in the receipt I guess,btohqsg
You used the UOB One card to pay right?,btohqsg
No I’m not referring to the 5% rebate from one card itself.  I’m just talking about the 17% purely,btohqsg
UOB One card should get 17% upfront discount  based on both UOB One and Shell website.,btohqsg
Ohh oops read it wrongly 😅,btohqsg
"fyi  he was indeed sarcastic at first and only answered my doubt later on.Imagine having every question sent here and such people answer ""check the tnc"" and ""read prev msg"" LOL",btohqsg
That’s what I tot so too. Do you think that’s a mistake or?,btohqsg
If it’s already answered previously  I don’t see the issue with saying that. Plus they were nice enough to even tell you the keywords to search for or even give the message link to click. Your response wasn’t nice either by saying “…” lol,btohqsg
Don't even see a 9% on tnc... But somehow they gave a 9% discount?,btohqsg
in the first place… a simple search “ppv xnap” would have given u ur answer immediately - i saw u asked the same question on wed and it went unanswered  so you’d rather wait 4 days for someone here to reply rather than find out yourself?,btohqsg
If people willing to help themselves they will. 😬 Something simple as reading tnc also refuse to do so  can't expect much. 🤪,btohqsg
Think should call up the bank and ask,btohqsg
XNAP uses Apple Pay. Apple Pay is excluded by CRCM. There’s physical and online Apple Pay,btohqsg
Like what samsam said  can check with bank if there's any undocumented changes to the discount 🤔Did you show your Shell GO+ digital membership?,btohqsg
Maybe a new nerf that they haven’t update 😱,btohqsg
Maybe a buff also. Originally 7% UOB One card instant discount  now is 9%?Then the remaining 5% come from Shell GO+ membership presented upon payment.Which means upfront 5% (Shell canopy discount) + 9% (UOB One discount) + 5% (Shell GO+ membership discount). Then 5% cashback if hit 2k tier.,btohqsg
"I did search before but ""Xnap PPV"" only has 6 search results and only 1 person has confirmed so. And 4 of which coming from me. So why cant i ask to double cfm?",btohqsg
So it comes down to if@Zora_Apshown his Shell GO+ membership upon payment..,btohqsg
Oh shell canopy means 5% shall station discount?,btohqsg
Yup correct. Shell GO+ membership used to be Shell Escape member.,btohqsg
Maybe check on Shell Asia app if they gave you points instead now.. if not the fault lies with Shell themselves already,btohqsg
Anyone here managed to get the ichange physical card? They say delivery to me using city link express 3 weeks ago.... Until now not here....,btohqsg
I believe they thought I was not using a uob one card ??,btohqsg
Think you're too scared of annual fees.If they charge annual fee  try to get it waived. If they don't want to  cancel it. (Sometimes they even give u an incentive to keep)You have some time (about 3 weeks maybe) after the af is charged to decide to cancel it. Then take your time to transfer out everything and cancel as needed.You're the customer. Don't need to be scared of the cards that want/need you as customer. If they can't give you what you want  say bye.,btohqsg
There is a chance other UOB card gives a total of 14%,btohqsg
I recall the shell payment terminal can auto detect your type of card. No need cashier to choose / key in,btohqsg
Maybe also but unlikely.Theory is that the Shell GO+ membership discount should be a separate line item.. what if you're not paying with UOB card but have Shell GO+ membership?,btohqsg
Hi experts need your opinion  if I spend about 2 000 plus a month  should I opt for UOB 2 000 tier or split between UOB one card and UOB Evol to maximise cash back? Thank you!,btohqsg
To add  nobody actually knows the threshold of approving the annual fee waiver. Can't know for sure whether you'll get it or not.One thing for sure is that if they charged you annual fee and you decided to cancel the card  they're obliged to return you the annual fee. Within a reasonable timeframe of course. Usually within 4 weeks of charging AF but to be safe make it 3 weeks,btohqsg
We have the scan the go+ qr code,btohqsg
If your $2000 consist of all eligible spend for UOB One card as well as additional cashback spend  you should go for UOB One card.,btohqsg
@MelvynEziyou manage to receive the ichange physical card?,btohqsg
"Hmm.. did they scan the QR code before they complete the payment? Some POS are quite stupid  before the cashier does a ""checkout""  must scan the membership first. If not they need to void the entire transaction once they ""checkout"".Not only regarding Shell GO+  others like yuu app works similarly. I got ""conned"" out of my yuu points because the cashier didn't know how to operate the yuu membership scanning portion.",btohqsg
I never use iChange.. just give you sad reaction for your long wait 🥲,btohqsg
I did the scan first before payment. But from what I see in the uob website   I have a strong feeling they assume it was all other uob card rather then one card,btohqsg
Can try to go back and ask them to explain ba 😅 don't make sense for them to combine 2 different discounts into 1 item,btohqsg
Hahah Yeap. It’s just another $3.3But anyway thanks all for your input. Much appreciated,btohqsg
A suggestion… if you have hsbc revo to pair it with XNAP instead of PPV as there’s no $5 block in hsbc revo… and given hawker food is lower in price you probably want each $1 to yield you 4mpd,btohqsg
I will probably explore1). $500 UOB One2). $600 Evol3). $Maybank FnF $900Vs UOB One $2000.If you have $200k saving  then possibly include OCBC card with OCBC 360 together with UOB one account n card in your consideration.,btohqsg

As melyvn mentioned  you can use heymax to aid your question. It’s difficult for us to assist when we don’t know what cards you owned  where you’re buying from  your objective  etc.,btohqsg
Hi  can anyone confirm if my VCMA made in Jan 2024 will not be refunded to me when i subsequently hit the annual CPF contribution cap of $37 740 by Dec 2024?My concern is on the tax relief for VCMA.Thank you in advance!,btohqsg
VCMA won’t be refunded  the $37 740 only refers to the cap on compulsory contributions from you and your employer.Tax relief for VCMA and RTSU is a separate $8 000 cap not affected by the $37 740.,btohqsg
For D top up cpf via the QR quote counted ?,btohqsg
sorry ar  contribution to medisave got tax relief  up to 8k,btohqsg

u just tried as in today?,btohqsg
if bank still don't want waive annual fees after threaten them to cancel the card  i just be foolish to pay annual fees if i really want to utilize the card?,btohqsg
The underlying MCC also matters  it should be a qualifying online spend.,btohqsg
All 3 transactions done on 26th Jan,btohqsg
amaze shows which mcc? travel spend even if online don’t get 10x,btohqsg
2 less than $10  the other $25+,btohqsg
Amount doesn’t matter. Check the mcc,btohqsg
These won’t get 10x points even with amaze^,btohqsg
Understand that amaze convert all purchase to online transactions. All 3 using paywave.1.Mcdonald $3.302.ShengSiong $25.603.Mcdonald $1.60Total: $29( $3+$25+$1),btohqsg
If you threaten them to cancel the card  you should be prepared to follow through on your threat 🙂,btohqsg
I think just wait a few more days  you should receive the reward points. It should be around 290 Points,btohqsg
Transaction posted $29 x 1.2 = 35milepoint. Let's see whether they reward the additional 255,btohqsg
Posted should have received. 35points for 1x also not correct,btohqsg
$29 x 1.2 local spending = 34.8 round off to 35,btohqsg
Why do you keep saying 1.2? Crmc doesn’t award points this way. 1x is 29  additional 9x is 261. Total 10x is 290 (equivalent to 116 miles) Not sure how you get to 1.2.,btohqsg
Does it come in mile points?,btohqsg
This is citi premier miles. A completely different card. did you link to citi premier miles instead?,btohqsg
Citi got many currencies worth differently.And they don’t pool.,btohqsg
I link Amazon with this credit card.  Is it a correct card?,btohqsg
This is Premier Miles. 1.2 mpd  not 4mpd Name is clearly stated at left corner on the card.,btohqsg
Hi new to miles here. how do you guys usually track your miles earned per card every month? Since I believe the miles amount per every transaction won’t be reflected right? Any tips would be appreciated,btohqsg
hi all  signed up for the moomoo cash plus promo almost 2 months ago1. is there a way to see the progress of when the 2 months will end exactly on which day on the app?2. how will moomoo top up the difference in return to match the 5.8%?,btohqsg
CRMC = Citi Rewards MasterCard  it’s not the same as Citi PremierMiles,btohqsg
Msg customer svc. They quite prompt.,btohqsg
U need to look for live agent,btohqsg
There’s a countdown on the promotion page,btohqsg
Anyone here new to trading? im really new and confuse,btohqsg
What does the FAQ on the website say?,btohqsg
Hi I’m currently own CRMC+amaze & HSBC revo credit card. I have a big purchase upcoming. Any other miles card y’all can recommend?,btohqsg
UOB VS or PPV for 4MPD,btohqsg
Hi guys what do you think of having multiples streams of income even though your main income is stable and how many income streams do you have?,btohqsg
Trading is not easy  often you are to be burned multiple times and still confused,btohqsg
Need more details. How big is the purchase  what mcc  online/offline payment  accepts paywave etc?,btohqsg
For me 1 main income from job  and investment as another streamRest of the time all go to job and family 🤣,btohqsg
What are the investments are you doing sir?,btohqsg
Is it stock market or MMF like that?,btohqsg
Looking to get a engagement ring. So was wondering should i get another card for their welcome reward,btohqsg
Ya sign up bonus is usually a good deal. Can consider UOB Prvi or Citi Presitige  I feel these two are some of the better deals. (Of course you need to go read up and see if you are comfortable with the terms),btohqsg
yea that's what scared me but people make fortunes out of it daily.do you have a youtube recommendation that you go to for this?,btohqsg
Going to be frank. Have u heard of survivorship bias,btohqsg
Any other 4miles per dollar card u would recommend? The only other card i know off is UOB ppv which you would have to spend 1k for 2 consecutive mnths,btohqsg
PPV and Visa Signature are 4mpd cards  but no sign up bonus. Spend 1k for 2 consecutive months is the terms for UOB Prvi Miles welcome bonus.HSBC Revolution is also a good card for every day spend but I’m not sure if it’s eligible for what you are going to spend on.,btohqsg
"ok i googled it""Survivorship bias is a type of sample selection bias that occurs when an individual mistakes a visible successful subgroup as the entire group""",btohqsg
Ye I mean  I'm not a trader so maybe someone can advise if you wanna go down that road  but do remember that not everyone will be successful.,btohqsg
Oh my bad haha. Yes just check with heymax its a eligible category for hsbc revo however for the first 1k spend only,btohqsg
If you can paywave  then ppv and vs are good. 1.1k on PPV  2k on VS,btohqsg
Hi everyone - I tried to search this in the community here  but couldn’t find the answer - if I have no relationship with Citi and am trying to get CRMC  I see a signup bonus on Citi site as well as singsaver. If I sign up via singsaver will I get both? Singsaver promo was 300 cash and Citi had 40000 thank you points. Appreciate your help! Thank you,btohqsg
Do you plan to quit your current job and trade daily?,btohqsg
kind of haha i know its really a gamble but i've seen quite alot of people did that (from reddit/youtube/tiktok),btohqsg
also i see trading is quite fun,btohqsg
Singsaver will bring you to Citibank's website to sign up  so you'll get the sign up bonus once you hit the eligibility.Just in case not clear enough  yes get both.,btohqsg
Oh thank you@MelvynEzi. You are the best!!,btohqsg
lol it's only fun when u're winning. 90% of traders lose money,btohqsg
what about options? did u do options before?,btohqsg
what's the difference btw trading options and trading stocks or whatever,btohqsg
Only if you're the 1-20% of the traders who win the trades.Imagine being in the 80-99% and going into debt  maybe not so fun after all 🤪,btohqsg
If these people actually earn a decent amount from trading  they wouldn't be wasting their time creating high production value videos and selling courses 🤪,btohqsg
Another one bites the dust...!BannedChua Mei.,btohqsg
it's hard to beat the S&P500,btohqsg
Ask yourself how much loss u can take before jumping into the gamble (be it trading or investing.) Dont count the money when it is not realise yet (paper gain is only paper gain. It is not finalise until u realise it).I guess it is not social norm for people to create youtube advocating how much loss they incur for trading?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone have any idea on how to invest into India’s stock market index through IBKR?,btohqsg
90% of day traders lose 90% of their money in 90 days 😅,btohqsg
Excuse me  can I ask for uob 1 account  if i still have pending charges for the credit card that hasn't been posted  will it be counted towards to 500 min spend For eg if I spent 500 on 31/1 but the charge is still pending do i still fulfill the min spend?,btohqsg
Also the ones that have truly found a method of trading that is profitable in the long term  would not be so keen to widely share such a method. Once enough people know about it and the market adapts  it stops becoming profitable 🤔,btohqsg
Has anyone tried requesting Citi to credit the 10 reward points that was not credited for Amaze transactions between 20 and 24 January?,btohqsg
I seem to keep buying high and selling low… 🥲,btohqsg
I think it is 90% of day traders lose money.Not 90% of all traders lose money. Look at how bank traders can rather consistently make money for their banks,btohqsg
fair  I suppose OP was thinking about day trading tho,btohqsg
banks no longer do prop trading...most teams have spun out or moved to platforms,btohqsg
In order to trade at the level of the banks  you need infrastructure and information at a level that is not feasible for the home trader. So for someone looking to quit their job and trade their own money full time  the 90% figure is pretty accurate,btohqsg
Maybe the key is the word “trade”. Which probably means harder to make money.Typical buy and hold should still make the average investor decent money.,btohqsg
Maybe he just want to see the total lor 🥴,btohqsg
you will not have 3mil in a month 😅,btohqsg
Yup. Buy and hold is investing  not trading 🙂,btohqsg
I have a quick qtn. I set up my singtel bill for recurring payment on my uob one debit card.Tis will count towards my $500 spending per month right?I intend to put my electricity bill too. Just to hit the $500 spend per month.,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword “Uob debit card $500 recur” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone know how to check current cash back status in Citibank app?,btohqsg
If one has enough assets to buy and hold and generate regular income  that could replace a full time job's income.YMMV,btohqsg
Purely illustrative example:If one has $10 million cash now  can buy 10 year Singapore Government Bonds at about 3% p.a. now.That would generate $300k Fixed Income per year or $25k per month.And I dare say this strategy is 100% make money at face value.(Lose to inflation or not I cannot comment  because my take is if you are not buying big value items  actually inflation even at 5% won't dent much of your monthly income).,btohqsg
To be very very clear  I am not suggesting anyone do this. I am just giving an example. Building a robust investment portfolio with a high certainty of return without much chances of losses is highly complicated and not something I think can be covered easily in a public forum.,btohqsg
no... the 7.8% is only on the final tier's balance... not the entire 91k,btohqsg
https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.pageread this and see the picture,btohqsg
7.8% is on your $75001 to $100000,btohqsg
each batch of 25k earns different interest  if you have total 100k then average out is 5%,btohqsg
Hi as long i’m pairing amaze with CRMC i should be getting 4 miles per dollar right?I checked heymax and it only states 0.4 miles even though the mcc is not on the blacklist,btohqsg
It's pretty clear on the tnc. EIR 5% p.a. if you have 100k. So that's 5k a year.,btohqsg
Which card is best for big purchase above $10k?,btohqsg
Are you buying insurance or furniture?,btohqsg
If you are paying $2000 on items with mcc code 5945  first $1k is 4mpd  remaining $1k is 0.4mpd.,btohqsg
So as long as its not in the blacklisted mcc and i’m pairing with amaze. It will be 10x reward right?,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website also proposes a list of best credit cards to use. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Yes  as long as not excluded MCCs  you will earn 4mpd.,btohqsg
Yea i was using heymax and it shows 0.4 instead of the 4 miles as long its online transaction. So was abit confused,btohqsg
Best way is to use heymax to check the MCC and verify against tnc. Some things have to check manually 👍🏻 all the best for your miles accumulation journey,btohqsg
Can heymax and Digibot give different MCC? And what could be the reason for this?,btohqsg
Heymax.aiwill be the best to tell.,btohqsg
Perhaps one based on MC interface n one based on Visa interface? I m not too sure.,btohqsg
Heymax is using visa api... Might deviate from mastercard transactions.,btohqsg
Do I still get 4mpd if I book with hsbc revo ontrip.com?,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website also proposes a list of best credit cards to use. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
7.8% is correct  in the same way that paying 7% or 11.5% income tax is correct. If you understand how one works  the way that the other works is just the flip side of the same coin 🙂,btohqsg
Historically  has there ever been a good/easy to fulfil sign up reward for Maybank Platinum Visa from Singsaver/Moneysmart?

Any idea which issuing bank to indicate when using Amaze card for Agoda payment? Or do I indicate the issuing bank of the linked card?,btohqsg
U want to use bank card directly if your hotel eligble for bank promo. Might be cheaper,btohqsg
Same promo discount for Amaze and the bank coz the promo is for Mastercard  so thought of using Amaze to avoid DCC from Agoda  but unsure what to fill for issuing bank during payment.,btohqsg
Citibank is 20 percent ocbc is 18 percent,btohqsg
I see  amaze dont have issuing bank  nium is the one that produce the card i think,btohqsg
I see. Guess can only indicate the linked card then. Tried citibank promo  but somehow not discounted.,btohqsg
Agoda at payment page sometime have error,btohqsg
Need to rekey card number or something to apply the bank discount,btohqsg
Question:I saw someone's comment here on this chat (in January 2024 )  that they link HSBC Revo to AliPayIs that better than linking Youtrip to AliPay? Cuz if you use Revo  won't you be subjected to worse exchange rates??? Net of the cashback = still worse off than using Youtrip?Anyone able to shine some light on this?,btohqsg
Maybe they want the miles? YouTrip no rewards,btohqsg
Any idea if you can use trust credit card for overseas instalment?,btohqsg

for the bonus interest....dunno how they counted $420.44....lol....i counted $424.869 thou... haha,btohqsg
Above 100k no bonus interest also,btohqsg
Your end day balance accurate one?,btohqsg
Got some dates don't make sense liao.. like 9 and 10 end of day balance how come different.. it's a Sunday on the 10th..Unless it's really counted like that based on your bank statement..,btohqsg
starhub pre auth deducted 1 dollar..lol..my figures are all current balance.. shown in app,btohqsg
Cannot based on current balance  based on the transactions.. you see StarHub's deduction is really on 10 Dec or 11 Dec,btohqsg
so daily closing is based on available balance?,btohqsg
The difference is the based interest? $4.24,btohqsg
dang! they said current balance! lmao,btohqsg
Your bonus interest on excel put 420.44 what did UOB give tho?I'm assuming the excel is created by you right?,btohqsg
ya..i create and recorded all movements,btohqsg
Seems tally with your excel ma  unless your excel data for interest is not by formula?,btohqsg
Where short? Your excel states 420.44 + 4.24.. same as the bank account 😅,btohqsg
my excel 4.24 and 420.44 i followed wat they gave....but how i count...i counted 424for bonus interest..haha,btohqsg
based on their tiered interest on MAB 100 070.85,btohqsg
Seems correct.. if I'm UOB I even kope back 3 cents 🥴,btohqsg
wow..ur diff 3 cents only! haha,btohqsg
Wouldn't complain getting 3 cents more if I were you,btohqsg
Hi I’m new here… planning for a wedding this year and totally lost in this credit card miles thingyAnyone can advise what’s the best card to use now for hotel banquet? Also  if my fiancé and I get diff cc are we able to combine our miles? 😅Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword “Wedding card” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
1. Confirm the hotel mcc first. You could ask them to let u pay $100 to test first. Generally speaking u should do well with 2 x Uob lady solitaire cards (6mpd now for $3k each per month  may drop to 4mpd after Feb)2. Cannot combine miles across 2 persons.,btohqsg

Hi  if I have a DBS credit card bill due on 19 Feb for amount $10k  and I pay $5k to the card today  will the GIRO arrangement automatically take care of the remaining $5k?,btohqsg
i assume you already have GIRO set up in place yes? if yes then from now till 19 feb is enough time for system to update to only deduct remaining amount. if your GIRO is this week and you pay 5k  system might still deduct full 10k from your account resulting in overpayment of 5k,btohqsg
Hello all  does anyone have problem with OCBC app? I have been trying to link my OCBC credit card to Amaze but on the verification page  OCBC app doesn't pop up. Even when I go into the app  there is nothing.,btohqsg

Hi. Yesterday I have subscribed and fund money into  moo moo 5.8% guaranteed for 2 months. Where can I check the amount that I have subscribed n confirm effective? As I can't find it on moo moo app. Anyone and advise pls,btohqsg
will still definitely go through as long as GIRO in place. issue with overpayment is  if you have only 5k left in the account and they still deduct 10k then the whole payment doesnt go through even though due amount is only 5k. if you have sufficient in the account for either amounts then no worries,btohqsg
the offer still ongoing? i think expired alr,btohqsg
whoops  just checked and the offer has expired  my bad,btohqsg
thoughts on cimb fd? 3.5% for 6 months,btohqsg

Great sp series 12  3.5% for 2yrs opened today,btohqsg

Then check the tnc is they will claw back anything or pay anything before 12 months. Usually if no sign up gift don't have any penalty to cancel.,btohqsg
So ShiokReceived 25k UNI$ as sign up bonus prvi miles last year,btohqsg

Check tnc before you plan anything... Do they need you to be new to bank customer  new to card customer  and others.,btohqsg
Ya check the tnc what new to bank means lo,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows how to set up giro to pay another bank's credit card through the HSBC app?,btohqsg
yes must check mcc to be safe  i did encounter one travel agency with mcc code in another category instead of travel,btohqsg
Only can do it through form.Make sure you have signature set-up with HSBC then submit the GIRO form to the other banks through snail mail.Takes at least 2 weeks to clear usually.,btohqsg
unfortunately very manual  need to print out form and send via mail... no joke lol,btohqsg
I link to YouTrip because I have the impression that Alipay and WeChat Pay are payment services providers and therefore no cashback or miles awarded. If u don't want to be bothered about weekdays or weekend spend  then go for YouTrip,btohqsg

If it affects your average daily balance to drop below the $500 increment requirement then you'll lose out the 1.5% p.a. lo,btohqsg
You need to check what is your last month MAB n this month MAB after withdrawing $9k. If less than $500  then😩,btohqsg
Withdraw end of the month will affect the $500 ?,btohqsg
How to check last month and this month mab?,btohqsg
I would assume you would have made an excel sheet to track your balances if you plan to withdraw monies at the end of month..You plug the number into your excel sheet and see if it affects when you minus off from the month before's ADB lor,btohqsg
If you still don’t know your MAB today  why take the risk on 29-31 Jan?,btohqsg
The month before adb amount is taken from 31dec2023 or 01jan2024?,btohqsg
Wdym? The amount is from 1 Dec 23 to 31 Dec 23.1 Jan 24 is this month lol.,btohqsg

#SCBDP#DPok latest update from my RMit seems SCB is tightening their Credit Card annual fee waiver criteria.No more Priority Banking customer = automatic/easy credit card fee waiverOne human of mine with $100k in SCB because of Bonus Saver did not get Bonus Saver credit card fee waiver. We had to appeal through the RM and needed 3 Manager level of approvals (WHAT THE HECK).RM updated if the account is fully funded with $200k cash  it MIGHT have been easier but once again no commitment there.not too happy with SCB.,btohqsg
For the rising dragon promo  register first or deposit fund first?,btohqsg

yeah i did this too one year ago!so far no priority bank has even come close to this fabulous promo,btohqsg
Register first.. make sure you get the ACKNOWLEDGEMENT (there is no CONFIRMATION EMAIL) first  before u fund it  but don't wait last minute.,btohqsg
then why are you unhappy? a relationship should be long term and not transactional. both sides win...:),btohqsg
