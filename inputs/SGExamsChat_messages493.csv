This one legit true all my ej friends say the same thing,btohqsg
if scgs ip girls were the majority of ej‚Äôs population  id understand,btohqsg
but theres only 100 of us,btohqsg
And when i have a choice to avoid itWhy not,btohqsg
thats an average of 2-3 in each class,btohqsg
I swear our ministers are clowns but when shit has to be done  it gets done,btohqsg

and theres a chance u wouldnt even know them,btohqsg
u wouldnt face 0 technically lmao,btohqsg
theres def one scgs girl in other jcs,btohqsg
U know scgs has olevel and ip right,btohqsg

Normal  this is what happens in a competitive environment,btohqsg
Ive lived w it for 4 yeatsNever againThats why u see how many olevel track scgs go ejc üòÇ less than 5,btohqsg

My h2 Geog report due tmr,btohqsg
hell nah from someone who ran away from geog since sec 2,btohqsg
that was not fun at all,btohqsg
according to ntu mod reviews that mod was basically like learning h2 geog + more in a sem,btohqsg
i hope you are being sarcastic,btohqsg
i could write an essay of how geog tortured me,btohqsg
at least drag me with u,btohqsg
ntu and nus hasnt given me an acceptance letter,btohqsg
take up some physics mods and you could be too,btohqsg
atp im waiting for second window üôÉ,btohqsg
but this rachel dont listen to reason,btohqsg
my fren in life sci say,btohqsg
its jsut cheaper ver of emd,btohqsg
Islike how data science ppl say they just wannabe compsci,btohqsg
aiya@rumchelu got offer from smu ar riht,btohqsg
1. goeg made me insane memorising plate tectonics2. i still don‚Äôt know plate tectonics3. too many content4. not interesting unlike history ( ppl who like history üòò ),btohqsg

Time to join siyan n lestin in physics hell,btohqsg
thought it was a good idea to take an MCQ only UE,btohqsg
purged that out of my memory after i applied S/U walking out of the final mid terms,btohqsg
tthen tho who get is what,btohqsg
oh lol this one you asking for it,btohqsg
ppga heard even harder to get in laul,btohqsg
give chance i never really thought to research my mods back then :'),btohqsg
i want ntu more than nus,btohqsg
literal hotspot oven baked me aside,btohqsg
but sm easier to get hall whilst enjoying my cca,btohqsg
it doesnt rlly make a diff,btohqsg
really? I think honestly i've seen quite good feedback from my friends who take business mods  usually mostly B+ or As,btohqsg
if ure despo enough for nus,btohqsg
depends on the specific mod la,btohqsg
i took digital lifestyle which is also pure MCQ but about tech,btohqsg
i alr did aba for all,btohqsg
u tell me now also no pt everyone sunmitted apps,btohqsg
not sure  depends on the sem too,btohqsg
i took it in sem 2,btohqsg
who am i to reject aba LOL,btohqsg
since when chs got such high demand,btohqsg
o poly kids are getting also,btohqsg
they say eaely may most of them get,btohqsg
imma add this to my list,btohqsg
it's really pure memorisation tho like,btohqsg
if can memorse = can score,btohqsg
cos the mcq just asks about the tech details,btohqsg
since its about tech i dont think it will be less enjoyable than memorising what the earth is made of,btohqsg
lols intnl kids getting their results alr,btohqsg
WHY ARE U STUDYING GEOG AND TECH,btohqsg
thats why u walk in left right is all non locals,btohqsg
this year people 88.75 rp need aba,btohqsg
as long as ig a plscement,btohqsg
to jump off the building rn,btohqsg
no news is betther than bad news,btohqsg
kud jumps from lack if response from nus and ntu,btohqsg
no news = insane anxiety spike,btohqsg
u go check ur app status,btohqsg
i dont even know how to apply to the uni iw go,btohqsg
now u see me trembling in fear,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think can tats the thing,btohqsg
Ik my fren got china Uni offer alr,btohqsg

My fren applied for tsin hua,btohqsg
She got offered but rejected the offer,btohqsg
China citizens are required to use gaokao,btohqsg
Ya that‚Äôs after u get ur Uni degree‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
yes like the whole point is they want to stop chinese citizens from avoiding gaokao,btohqsg
but idk about the ones living outside china yknow,btohqsg
people would do a lot to evade it,btohqsg
one of my profs used to teach at tsinghua,btohqsg
zj we had very different ideas,btohqsg
As i said not good for my internet footprint,btohqsg
But socio is not exactly something you want right iirc?,btohqsg
SO SEE YOU NEVER IN NTU,btohqsg
i intended to take double major socio pol sci,btohqsg
i was intending to take socio and pol sci,btohqsg
I mean this kind of thing,btohqsg
I think you can take socio first then get >4.0 gpa and appeal for double major after end of y1,btohqsg
But seems like a tedious process,btohqsg
will i do well in socioctho,btohqsg
if i appeal and cmi to ppga,btohqsg
will it mean they wont gove me socio back?,btohqsg
Wait i don't exactly remember how the appeal system works but iirc the appeal system is only after the acceptance window? So youd have to accept socio first before appealing for ppga IIRC,btohqsg
Dont quote me pls already 2 years since application,btohqsg
‚Äúhi sorry i acvept but actually i want this‚Äù,btohqsg
At least if they reject your appeal you have something to fall back on,btohqsg
truly manifested the acceptance by whining a lot,btohqsg
but it's an ntu acceptance regardless,btohqsg
BRUH BE THANKFUL FOR THE MANIFEST,btohqsg
IDK IF I FARE A CHANCE AT,btohqsg
im alr one foot into socio grave,btohqsg
at least if im in ppga and i cant get socio,btohqsg
what‚Äôs this University can‚Äôt relate old fucks,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt recall facing that panic since my prospects were bad anyway,btohqsg
It was either get physics or get nothing :(,btohqsg
iestin I'm probably TAing y2 lab next sem btw,btohqsg
Ehhh let me know your slot timing then,btohqsg
I try to sign up for yours,btohqsg
Then you can see how terrible ive been skating by with my lab reports,btohqsg
i think you do stars before i get assigned so,btohqsg
NBS  SPMS  HSS also near each other,btohqsg
you js lmk your slot too ba then i see if i can choose,btohqsg
i contemplating between ntu socio and smu pol sci now,btohqsg
Why we need to take a math for pure science ahh?,btohqsg
Ntu guaranteed 2 year hostel cough,btohqsg
not taking math for pure science will really snowball the further you go,btohqsg
AT LEAST I CAN USE FENCING FOR HALL PTS,btohqsg
so theres more opportunity for me to go hall,btohqsg
on the flipside if im shit everywhere and i cant grt hall im fucked,btohqsg
3 hr trip is no joke,btohqsg
to and fro total 6 hrs eh,btohqsg
I THOUGHT U TOLD ME DONT COME NTU,btohqsg
i wld like aircon la cuz i cannot tahan ntu heat,btohqsg
i js want somewhere to sleep at night,btohqsg
If you need somewhere to sleep at night,btohqsg
first two years just build connections,btohqsg
that‚Äôs if i can do well üôÉ,btohqsg
like that even if you no hall you can still crash and squat,btohqsg
i can rent out my office you go bring sleeping bag yourself,btohqsg
Actually lowkey comfortable tho and i havent seen anyone being chased out yet,btohqsg
yea i spent the night there before doing lab report,btohqsg
help thats my intention worst case scenario,btohqsg
Okay library definitely cannot bah they needa close,btohqsg
Which library is open 24/7 wtf,btohqsg
but yea for sleeping spms is the best imo,btohqsg
nus library opened 24/7 during exams szn,btohqsg
the big thing icking me from ntu is,btohqsg
2. its uphill and too. freaking. hot.,btohqsg
im going to die of heat,btohqsg
what are the chances i can take up ppga as second degree at end of y1,btohqsg
How come i dont remember theres an uphill,btohqsg
the entire ntu is on a hill,btohqsg
I take the campus bus everywhere so i dont feel it :'),btohqsg
i nvr take ntu campus bus before,btohqsg
i gonna appeal but i not sure if i cannot get into ppga i want annot,btohqsg
Campus bus is love hate reln,btohqsg
would smu pol sci be better than ntu socio?,btohqsg
Eh this sem its actually so much better fr,btohqsg
Never found something to complain about this sem,btohqsg
i don't miss tong tar transport,btohqsg
ntu hall way cheaper than that of nus and smu,btohqsg
