Hi everyone  we'd like to introduce our Online Study Groups! Weâ€™ll be hosting small group study sessions on Discord every week  where students can help each other with their studies and homework.From 27 Feb  weâ€™ll be holding the first study groups on a sign-up basis (for now).What is the format? What subjects are you covering?Weâ€™ll host sessions based on your preferences. For example  if you indicated interest for A-Level H2 Maths on weekends  weâ€™ll host math sessions on weekends.How is this different from online lessons?Some may feel awkward asking questions in class while others donâ€™t want to be caught mugging. We want to create a chill  judgement-free zone to study and make new friends.How is this different from Telegram?Telegram is text-based. For some  regular calls can better help develop study habits and a sense of community.Is this tuition?No. Itâ€™s a peer study group. Weâ€™ll have student ICs to guide discussion.Hope to see you there! Sign uphereRules and guidelines,btohqsg
