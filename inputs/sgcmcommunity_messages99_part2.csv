I still have the impression that older car technology will outlast new engines designs from 2010 onwards.,btohqsg
Maintenance is standard like any euro car. But if you’re buying it  look out mostly for rear springs and suspension issues. The stock ones have a tendency of snapping round the bottom due to rust. The control arms  roll bar drop links  etc all should be something you worry about. Just listen for clunks and knocks when you go over bumps on your test drives.You’re out of the rusteez period with this so no need to worry about that….err…engine should also run smooth  misfiring is not uncommon for the C180K  GB is also somewhat prone to leaking in some production years.That’s it…easier to PPI for these things. But also  with a car like this  preventative maintenance and repairs are Godsend,btohqsg
