Yeap this is the true nature of the market and also why is volatile. Never did I say that the market price must be exactly the same as the NAV/shr but if there is large diff  it should be substantiated.The NAV/shr provide the basis of the true value of what you are paying for and anything above is a premium. A simple example using property market. There is valuator reports but nobody follow the valuator report. If the valuator told you it cost $100 but seller sell $200 the buyer need to consider if he should pay the premium. In share market such premium comes in the form of dividend (future cash flow)  potential growth and risk.Back to your example on SGX  the potential growth  fixed dividend policy and risk of it belly up compare to Oceanus  of course SGX will be traded many times its true value. You are paying for the future income and potential with low risk of belly up. This can be considered as a dividend cash cow.Now for Oceanus  no dividend policy  small cap with high risk  unstable revenue  (FMCG products)  increased in liability by 132% mainly for distribution purpose. Most impt the NAV increase is only 26% for FY2020 compare to the price increase of 188%. The potential is pretty grim .In case you want to counter that no share price will be the same or below the reported NAV/shr  take a look at Hai Leck. Their FS just came out today.,btohqsg
"Currently price at 0.58 only. Unfortunately there is no ""waves"" but this is definitely a gem for value investors.",btohqsg
Such value share will grow even without waves but the process is definitely slow....,btohqsg

Not sure what exactly do you want out of the conversation. Seem like you are just sore and nitpicking. In any case  to indulge your curiosity  the % price increase I mentioned is the market price. From 0.025 to 0.075. Believe you should be capable to do the math from there.  I‚Äôm going off from this chat but if you do think that Oceanus is a good buy  do substantiate the reason with facts or figures like Mystic. At least he does it through technical analysis. As I myself is a fundamentalist  I do not recommend Oceanus. Good night.,btohqsg
