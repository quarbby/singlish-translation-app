i would say the happiest part of my dhs life is feb 2023,btohqsg
Na here's some EnglishWhatever their differences  scientists and artists begin with the same question: can you and I see the same thing the same way? If so  how? The scientific thinker looks for features of the thing that can be stripped of subjectivity―ideally  those aspects that can be quantified and whose values will thus never change from one observer to the next. In this way  he arrives at a reality independent of all observers. The artist  on the other hand  relies on the strength of her artistry to effect a marriage between her own subjectivity and that of her readers. To a scientific thinker  this must sound like magical thinking: you’re saying you will imagine something so hard it’ll pop into someone else’s head exactly the way you envision it? The artist has sought the opposite of the scientist’s observer-independent reality. She creates a reality dependent upon observers  indeed a reality in which___in order for it to exist at all.1. Human beings must participateobjectivity should be maintained2. Science and art need to harmonize3. Readers remain distanced from the arts4. She is disengaged from her own subjectivity,btohqsg
@kohsyansenior  may i ask how likely are they to grant clash waivers?,btohqsg
what is this korean SAT question,btohqsg
Law of large number says its 3,btohqsg
It actually aren't hard it's just so dense,btohqsg
I just saw the dish collector auntie catch a pigeon with her barehands and walked out of the kopitiam and yeet the bird out.,btohqsg
I js sat down eh thts all,btohqsg
i was taking A levels in 2015,btohqsg
I want to take BS1001 intro bio but it clashes with my ph3103 quantum tech's lecture,btohqsg
yea this one idt they’ll allow bc they can cite potential test clashes during the lecture timeslot,btohqsg
But cannot be both mods will do mid terms on the same week at the same time bah...,btohqsg
But ya i can see how theyll use that argument,btohqsg
Our sch got like a run challenge  basically in pairs if both ppl get total of 100+ km get a shirt,btohqsg
And sum1 in our class got 270💀,btohqsg
wow they can become athletes ngl,btohqsg
It aint possible for uni to grant clash waiver (even if u r thinking of skipping classes💀),btohqsg
gpa might drop if you take too much leave though,btohqsg
Thats like 2hrs every day lol,btohqsg
It's possible for Engineering a lot is Prerecorded lectures,btohqsg
Then clash wavier that depends on school,btohqsg
A Singaporean man has been charged with murder in Perth after he allegedly hit a cyclist with his car and dragged the victim under the vehicle for over 30m.https://str.sg/mkC9,btohqsg
A 27-year-old Singaporean man has been charged with murder in Perth after he was accused of intentionally hitting a cyclist with his car and dragging the victim under the vehicle for over 30m.Ng Jing Kai is said to have approached the 48-year-old cyclist over a property dispute around 1.45pm on May 24 while driving a grey Kia Carnival car in Carlisle  a suburb in Perth.According to Ng’s LinkedIn profile  he has been a mathematics tutor with Indigo Education Group since October 2022.He has a bachelor’s in accounting from the Nanyang Technological University and graduated from Dunman High School in 2015.,btohqsg
the 27 year old lol. i know him,btohqsg
dhs 2015 is my batch so,btohqsg
I wonder why ST mentions his qualifications,btohqsg
to show that “elites” can be bad in moral,btohqsg
"""elites"" should be referring to PHD",btohqsg
only Doctor of Philosophy should be,btohqsg
why they say he from dhs ☠,btohqsg
how is he like as a person,btohqsg
Nice so Si Yan is 4 years my senior,btohqsg
Gotta catch up with him dang it,btohqsg
Lol i went econs tuition at indigo…,btohqsg
No…but dhs is considered elite sch tho,btohqsg
We all know ST can be so boliao,btohqsg
I have a Bachelors in Yappology and a Masters in Psychopathy,btohqsg
He is the senate herehow dare you piss off our overlord Irwen,btohqsg
No way my ex hall pres will ban me,btohqsg
I have a kink for getting banned,btohqsg
Ikr I love a person who dominates their authority over me,btohqsg
Sup iggy can u ban me?,btohqsg
U could have waited like a few mins when they got on discount..,btohqsg
All school is a good school,btohqsg
Don don donki? Nah just 🧊storage,btohqsg
honestly schools that dh pri/sec in the name feels diff,btohqsg
Even the one with a swastika,btohqsg
A man ate gas station sushi for dinner. This is what happen to his stomach,btohqsg
I like that better tbh can u do that for all future responses,btohqsg
from now on i'll do that to all ur messages,btohqsg
Is like disturbing the mata. Just poke poke until they arrest u,btohqsg
Then u get the nice cuffs.. they even give u accommodation,btohqsg
I have a PhD in brainrottology,btohqsg
i wonder how the kopi taste like,btohqsg
That one they dun even cuff u.,btohqsg
Na my parents go before legit is just kopi if they had stuff u don't get the kopi liao,btohqsg
YI is a man presenting to the emergency room with swelling shortness of breath and hives.,btohqsg
Even had lunch with the occiper downstairs after at the canteen,btohqsg
Bad idea to offer em a drink as a treat I think.,btohqsg
Oh fuck whr tf is my earbuds case,btohqsg
i have a double phd in misinformation,btohqsg
Can I get another middle finger,btohqsg
was pretty normal lor. in uni he even had a side hustle delivering bee hoon from a nearby place to all the ntu halls,btohqsg
Should i go back to my sch to collect my o lvl cert,btohqsg
Will they still keep it actually,btohqsg
It's a nice cert and the paper quality is nice.Great for wiping your ass with,btohqsg
I realised i really did not collect coz i blur and dunno need to collect lol,btohqsg
They just called my mum last yr,btohqsg
But idk if this yr they still hv it,btohqsg
Call back again and ask lor,btohqsg
I paiseh go back tbh but nvm i will jio my friend over coz she bo paiseh💀💀,btohqsg
Probably do but they kept it somewhere in the General office and just lost it,btohqsg
And now will be the right time to collect when the o lvl class of 2023 are also coming to sch to collect their certs🤣,btohqsg
So i wun be a lone random alumni stepping into the school,btohqsg
Your school didn't give you your Olevel Cert with your Results slip?,btohqsg
Technically the class of 2023 are considered alumni liao,btohqsg
Weird by right they should. Shit admin I guess,btohqsg
Yea so i wun be the only alumni stepping into the sch grounds,btohqsg
I considered doing MOE relief work for my secondary school,btohqsg
I mean i tot they did coz i tot it was the laminated thing but it is in black book,btohqsg
Go back as a History relief teacher,btohqsg
that is why i did not go collect last yr,btohqsg
Yea i think this is the one i did not collect,btohqsg
No wonder i tot sec sch no testimonial💀,btohqsg
Not if u have your Alevel one.,btohqsg
I dh my degree scroll yet,btohqsg
Then your testimonial from your employer or your alevel one would count first.,btohqsg
Heck just get a testimonial from a prof u like,btohqsg
The prof u hate the least.,btohqsg
No is just a sprint thru the names,btohqsg
By program and that's about it,btohqsg
The discord I think she did,btohqsg
Those are the ones that are given awards and usually speak one,btohqsg
Most programs in NUS and NTU are direct Honors programs,btohqsg
Legit all it is a stage and u walk up take and take photo then zao,btohqsg
Then ask the admin to put your name behind lor,btohqsg
Idk what u want them to do lmao,btohqsg
Actually i initially tot it is in gpa descending,btohqsg
No what the hell this isnt some sort of pyramid game,btohqsg
Also what a waste of admin resources to do so,btohqsg
At least it was  im not sure now,btohqsg
Why tf would the admin do so?Everything in life u need to pass the soundness check,btohqsg
I mean fine if u would not believe someone who told me off experience,btohqsg
my guy hes just saying what he heard no need to get so worked up LOL,btohqsg
as far as im concerned it wouldnt sound out of character for the education system back then too,btohqsg
no. after a while it's most likely gone,btohqsg
what's all the deleted messages lol,btohqsg
"""You want her number i give u bro"" sum guy on zoom",btohqsg
They will nvr take my hair,btohqsg
Was scared af i lost it,btohqsg
Reminds me of RVs performance in NKhttps://youtu.be/u1yfUXIj3Xg?si=QshbtpvklZMLqhdd,btohqsg
How do u know there are deleted messages,btohqsg
people were replying to deleted messages,btohqsg
Fun fact is the sch called my mum to ask me collect it last yr…like bruh after 6y then they called,btohqsg
Si Yan what other mods u TA?,btohqsg
And last yr i didnt bother coz i tot the cert is the laminated thingy lol,btohqsg
Whoops I deleted some message just now,btohqsg
this sem only that one mod bc i teaching two tutorial slots,btohqsg
Awww in Sem 2 which mods,btohqsg
not sure yet. it's assigned before every sem,btohqsg
maybe i wanna TA lab. just smth that's not y3 mod lol,btohqsg
Errr the sky or my celling?,btohqsg
:( why never TA a non prerequisite mod,btohqsg
So.. is that a no? >:(,btohqsg
Wdym what to take note tho,btohqsg
H3 math is a load of proofs,btohqsg
How does studying H3 Maths prepare you for EEE,btohqsg
H3 maths prepare u for math,btohqsg
I think just solidify your h2 maths should be fine,btohqsg
I feel H3 math will be too extreme for EEE  but FM may help,btohqsg
H3 math isn't that useful for EEE yea,btohqsg
if you really wanna self study  focus on going further in calculus,btohqsg
Because i believe there are proofs qn also,btohqsg
Also u chose the wrong H3 lmao pretty sure it's H3 Semiconductor Physics that is taught by EEE,btohqsg
just look up multivariable calculus/vector calculus stuff,btohqsg
nah i'm just more familiar with how ntu runs lol,btohqsg
This should be sth u considered before applying,btohqsg
If u looking at engineering for money u in the wrong sector,btohqsg
Then focus on linear algebra and calculus,btohqsg
U shld go for what u want and not for money,btohqsg
Like what they say vector calculus,btohqsg
complex analysis will be needed too but after the others,btohqsg
There are a lot of people who go cs for money and then drop out coz they js cant,btohqsg
Well that does not mean you can't pivot from engineering to other areas though,btohqsg
Anyways regarding this  it is readily available info on the uni websites,btohqsg
It's just engineering itself is intensive af lor,btohqsg
I mean pay is still relatively okay la,btohqsg
Yeah.. that's what I am suspecting happened. EEE shot up in GES earnings,btohqsg
But if you want to pivot to other areas that are higher pay,btohqsg
anyway besides the math stuff  probs good to revise your h2 physics stuff bc your sem 1 will have a physics mod iirc,btohqsg
I mean I saw the GES that CS median salary has dropped and engineering salary has increased,btohqsg
Yeah but that's cuz engi salary has always been depressed,btohqsg
Then it is believed that the engineering people pivoted into finance or swe,btohqsg
any quantitative degree can pivot into finance if you have the skills,btohqsg
I think Comp Engi also raised the GES too,btohqsg
I heard of physics people in the end do finance also,btohqsg
And I have a friend doing SWE as a physicist,btohqsg
Everyone can Humanities too lmao I had a few seniors now in analyst positions,btohqsg
depending on the role you apply for,btohqsg
I feel that your math + problem solving skills are the reason why you are hired in finance,btohqsg
Finance can earn big bucks isit,btohqsg
a lot of finance places look more for quantitative skills + coding ability,btohqsg
But heard can earn big bucks,btohqsg
i mean it's an option for me,btohqsg
Not like going thru 4y  then u try to pivot…but it is impt for u to know what u want by end of y2,btohqsg
My cs friend internship pay $5k / mth💀💀,btohqsg
you have time to figure these parts out but try to explore as you go along,btohqsg
U hit the prerequisite of being asian,btohqsg
And you have to figure out if it suits you or not,btohqsg
like when you're in undergrad  take time to try out other skills,btohqsg
Some people like that work culture,btohqsg
apply for internships see if you like it,btohqsg
I still tryna find some of the hall cats,btohqsg
Does that count as a skill Si Yan?,btohqsg
I had an engineering friend and he go to the IB route,btohqsg
lol i was in the cat management network,btohqsg
I only know ppl who study business mostly go to marketing,btohqsg
U in Grad club as well?,btohqsg
Everyone’s journey is unique  dun take someone’s path as a guide and be fixed on it,btohqsg
anyway the best advice i can give for career is try things out as much as possible,btohqsg
even if you hate it  you can cross smth out,btohqsg
Doesn't mean you are in engineering means stuck in engineering,btohqsg
But if u are thinking of pivoting away fr ur degree  think far ahead and try out internships first,btohqsg
So either way that's one thing I hope you can realise,btohqsg
And also it is not too late to switch course,btohqsg
there's compulsory internships but you can literally apply whenever you want,btohqsg
That's why I wanna try your mods. If I hate it at least got Si Yan to scold,btohqsg
Huh what field can earn money?,btohqsg
I mean under mom law…ya u cant work for free,btohqsg
How much will i get paid,btohqsg
This one depends on the job,btohqsg
depends on company  field  your portfolio,btohqsg
Or which field are you talking about?,btohqsg
And there is no limit on number of internships,btohqsg
I usually will discourage people to become an insurance agent,btohqsg
Hmm ok thanks for explaining to me guys,btohqsg
i had no internships in uni until year 3 where i did 2 simultaneously,btohqsg
and my major then didn't even require me to,btohqsg
I prob do internship all the way till i graduate,btohqsg
Ofc do expect finding it harder to apply for internships in y1/2,btohqsg
Now almost all majors require at least 1 intern stint,btohqsg
Real estate agent like getting hard ever since the HDB portal comes out,btohqsg
You still can sell condos and private properties though,btohqsg
maybe you can see from your first sem if you're interested in the engineering side of things lol,btohqsg
Dk eh feel like applying to IEM,btohqsg
But i think y1 not really good gauge,btohqsg
which is a good thing imo,btohqsg
Coz it is mostly foundation stuff,btohqsg
go for it if it's smth you're into,btohqsg
I mean even you want to do internships,btohqsg
Also must do something that you feel that you want to go there in the future,btohqsg
A bit pointless if you chiong internship all the way but ended up just doing it for fomo,btohqsg
If u want to change course  do so early  there is a limit on how many modules u can map over as electives so u wun hv to grad later,btohqsg
Some do it for the money too especially those high paying ones,btohqsg
If only my time has those high paying ones,btohqsg
Still doing fine despite no internship,btohqsg
If got decent GPA and not some no name uni should be fine also,btohqsg
I feel now like getting tougher and tougher in terms of job market ngl,btohqsg
My time CS is like starting to get popular,btohqsg
Ben Leong also starting to get more traction,btohqsg
But not so popular until like everyone wants to do CS,btohqsg
True but I feel there are some industries ppl just dw one,btohqsg
If down turn just retreat back to those lor,btohqsg
Imo once it starts to get main stream it loses steam liao,btohqsg
Needs to be a niche degree so the supply is constraint at its infancy,btohqsg
Like NUS Confessions/NUSWhispers have been there for like 8 years liao,btohqsg
Its there when I'm like a Y2/Y3 student,btohqsg
But losing steam for CS at least the job vacancies drying up,btohqsg
Makes sense when u pump out thousands of CS grads all wanting high pay,btohqsg
i'll go be corporate slave then retire as some poly lecturer,btohqsg
I thought you mean the prof/NUSWhispers,btohqsg
But I feel that people will still do CS la ngl,btohqsg
Probably become some paper pusher and then retire as a tution teacher or smth,btohqsg
Si Yan for Prof.. Assoc Prof Si Yan sounds cool,btohqsg
U mean as a paper pusher? Doesn't rlly have to be. Can be private sector too as executive lor,btohqsg
But I feel government is more paper pusher than private,btohqsg
Yeah but those type usually ain't in high demand one.,btohqsg
Private most of them are thinking about making profits,btohqsg
Pays decently and keeps my lights on,btohqsg
Depends Singapore has many Government-Private Enterprise,btohqsg
An example is the commercial part of SMRT,btohqsg
for now i'll write papers. next time then push them,btohqsg
That... Probably makes me think twice about working at Fairprice in the future,btohqsg
I thought of working for them if I am back in SG,btohqsg
Nah I will probably reconsider that decision,btohqsg
Their culture quite toxic. But then again it's SG,btohqsg
Then probably even if I push my ideas to improve their operations,btohqsg
Its going to go through bureaucracy,btohqsg
Goes from Executive to Senior Executive to Manager to VP to CEO then to Board,btohqsg
By then probably other people has implemented what I want to do,btohqsg
I think I shall consider other supermarket giants in SG,btohqsg
It's actually even more funny for some enterprises,btohqsg
Cuz the other peripheral functions is contracted out to external companies,btohqsg
Well the SG mentality of wanting things to be cheap,btohqsg
So u can have an executive that manages a Supervisor that is incharge of a team of technicians but the Supervisor and technicians not even the same company,btohqsg
Then obv the Supervisor itself might have sub contract out the technicians as well la etc etc,btohqsg
Kena complain legit just push the blame,btohqsg
Yea I know what's going on,btohqsg
Its going to be a culture shock once I return to Singapore to work,btohqsg
Lmao only thing I can say is good about SG is food,btohqsg
Hmm working in SG will be an interesting experience,btohqsg
When I return to Singapore to work  I probably have 7 years of experience working in Japan,btohqsg
So while I am a Singaporean and probably have been under the Singapore's working culture,btohqsg
Experiencing after 7 years in Japan is probably an interesting experience,btohqsg
Because the working culture is actually pretty different,btohqsg
I got sianz of singapore office culture in like 1-2 months,btohqsg
That might probably happen to me,btohqsg
Different culture  different ways of doing,btohqsg
Learn to read the air and I should be able to survive,btohqsg
As long as I get paid considered good liao,btohqsg
Yeah that's basically the only reason why like half or more than half the office come to work,btohqsg
Because it pays the bills for me / my family,btohqsg
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU HERE,btohqsg
Lol why I can't be here,btohqsg
When someone discovers discord isn't the only channel,btohqsg
Ok tbf I joined for the fun of it,btohqsg
Bobian my luck not good to have rich parente,btohqsg
So have to go out and make dough,btohqsg
Last time I wish for lavish life. Now all I want is just not to worry about income,btohqsg
That's probably another thing I won't get used to,btohqsg
Because in Japan  we are probably pretty professional and serious in what we are doing,btohqsg
Honestly what is the working life like in jpn,btohqsg
Then the classic singapore experience after is during a long weekend u partipate in the Causeway fun,btohqsg
It might be surprising to you all  but the working hours is not as long as what you all thought out to be,btohqsg
I feel that maybe Singaporeans work longer than Japanese lol,btohqsg
Then Covert your dough into 3.5 more dough and then burn thru that in 5 days come back,btohqsg
Of course there are outliers la,btohqsg
What's Japan work hrs like tho,btohqsg
Japanese companies probably have more team bonding events like the drinking sessions and all,btohqsg
I worked on a 7 hours and 45 minutes contract before,btohqsg
Currently mine is 7 hours but I usually OT for one more hour,btohqsg
Name's Valerie nicr to meet u,btohqsg
There's the classic 9-5 but also tbh 8-6 also quite common even 9-5 most often stay till 6 to clear the work,btohqsg
Because I get the OT pay,btohqsg
Or like today I OT for extra 2.5 hours,btohqsg
What's your progress on those pads lmao,btohqsg
Because I want to clear that initial coding phase otherwise I will forget what I am doing when Monday comes,btohqsg
@whatisgrasseh this one might be the same person,btohqsg
Yes there are meetings in Japanese company,btohqsg
And want to see results happening,btohqsg
Don't like to idle too much,btohqsg
Either way Japanese companies are progressing in general,btohqsg
Hahaha OT pay.. doesn't rlly happen in SG in my experience,btohqsg
One of our clients are now implementing a no meeting week,btohqsg
If u get OT pay means some shit rlly did occur cuz 1.5 times the rate employers damn stingy one,btohqsg
Usually need to fill in like 2-3 more forms for finance  hr to cover their ass from MOM,btohqsg
That's why I tell you man,btohqsg
Singapore companies really love to cut cost,btohqsg
But lunch is lunch 12-2 u come office macam ghost town,btohqsg
They are good in cutting short term cost but usually that will incur more long term cost,btohqsg
Cuz we really don't get any protections in our employment contracts,btohqsg
So the moment we get to stretch ambiguous shit like lunch out ppl just do it,btohqsg
Is there ever good office culture anywhere?,btohqsg
Yeah. Not going into office daily,btohqsg
I think depends on department bah,btohqsg
I mean the company can be sucky,btohqsg
No it's standard all need to come office daily,btohqsg
But if your manager and the team are good I feel that can be a plus,btohqsg
Most SG companies mandate that lmao,btohqsg
Actually coming office daily is not a deal breaker for me ngl,btohqsg
It's fine if it's more productive,btohqsg
I mean even if its unproductive,btohqsg
I still get paid being unproductive,btohqsg
Tbh I just get bored if that's the case,btohqsg
Well I mean its the company's money,btohqsg
Thing tho there is still the element of direct surveillance in office,btohqsg
At home I can literally turn off,btohqsg
Japan is an open office concept,btohqsg
At unproductive times its the art of looking busy sometimes,btohqsg
So I am very used to the direct surveillance liao,btohqsg
But that shouldn't be a problem for me,btohqsg
Actually what do u do in those times,btohqsg
What's your go to action of busy but not really hitting kpi,btohqsg
My supervisor actually cares more about if I actually deliver what I need to deliver,btohqsg
So sometimes during downtime maybe just do leetcode,btohqsg
Or maybe do some adhoc stuff,btohqsg
Same but still have to look like u doing something either for sanity or just looks,btohqsg
Maybe read what other people are doing and all,btohqsg
Yeah that's what I do for now tbh,btohqsg
Sometimes I even slow down what I am trying to do,btohqsg
If sleepy probably do some stretching,btohqsg
Isn't it like 2am in Japan now,btohqsg
And I have no work tme,btohqsg
Probably gonna catch up on some school work,btohqsg
Me catching up some school work?,btohqsg
Ngl that is probably a bit pointless for me,btohqsg
I probably will catch up if its required for my work,btohqsg
Btw what made you choose to work in Japan instead of Singapore,btohqsg
Back then I conduct my job search,btohqsg
Then Japan is the first and the only one who gives me the job offer,btohqsg
Me wanna go exchange in jp,btohqsg
But first need settle a lvl,btohqsg
I feel that Japan's job offer is probably the best one,btohqsg
They pay might not be as good as the one in Singapore,btohqsg
But the experience is very good,btohqsg
I probably won't be getting a very fruitful experience if I work in Singapore,btohqsg
Is it like you got a job offer from a company based in Singapore/that company has a branch here,btohqsg
Bruh my ADHD ass cannot be punctual,btohqsg
Your job is sth related to retail right,btohqsg
There is actually no branch in Singapore,btohqsg
I legit cannot work in japan,btohqsg
The Japanese company is in Japan,btohqsg
at some point i have to pick between passion vs literally every other pro possible 💀,btohqsg
Bro how much do they emphasize on punctuality there,btohqsg
So I started with IT outsourcing,btohqsg
I recall you mentioned something about supermarkets?,btohqsg
Outsourced to Hitachi Solutions doing image processing,btohqsg
Then outsourced and finally converted when I am in Japan Weather Association,btohqsg
Actually my job is in demand forecasting,btohqsg
And the companies that I am dealing with are like supermarkets and restaurants,btohqsg
From outsourced staff to contract satff,btohqsg
I'm not converting to full time because the benefits are worse and I am potentially leaving SG soon,btohqsg
So... You part time or sth?,btohqsg
Actually my job now is more of dealing with supply chain,btohqsg
So in Japan there are different job contracts,btohqsg
You have haken which is the outsourced staff,btohqsg
Mine is a keiyaku which means contract staff (1 year renewable),btohqsg
Then you have the ultimate of the ultimate which is permanent staff,btohqsg
Things like inventory management  replenishment with the aid of weather data,btohqsg
Its pretty rare to do such stuff in Singapore ngl,btohqsg
Considering supply chain is actually a sunset industry in SG now sadly,btohqsg
Well it is what it is,btohqsg
But I generally discourage females to work in Japan because you probably won't get good benefits in terms of the pay compared to the male counterparts,btohqsg
Again it depends on the company,btohqsg
But Japanese payscale usually follow the traditional payscale,btohqsg
So by age and then by gender,btohqsg
So you have done 3 different jobs in Japan so far?,btohqsg
Heavy Thundery Showers With Gusty Wind,btohqsg
I go to sleep and wake up Mayushii is still there,btohqsg
I went off for so long  still see Mayushii and E120,btohqsg
I actually woke up at like 7am Japan timing,btohqsg
And then go back to sleep,btohqsg
Like prolly polo + jeans / pants for guys,btohqsg
When i was in jpn  i woke up at ard 6.30am almost every day,btohqsg
I cannot go back to sleep after getting out of bed:-(,btohqsg
Just wore black and grey long pants and t shirt,btohqsg
be smart and casual at the same time,btohqsg
Missing the former and im introvert💀,btohqsg
Goddam blowing balloon even with pump is pein,btohqsg
it's ok. Just need to act it,btohqsg
There is going to be one near my hse…idk if i should sign up,btohqsg
Tho if uw stay in sg,btohqsg
Oh yea it is free anyways,btohqsg
The sun usually shines quite brightly early in the morning,btohqsg
Sometimes 5am already quite bright liao,btohqsg
No idea how these balloon valves work,btohqsg
Im not sure if i was dreaming but one night i woke up at 4.30am and it was bright outside alr,btohqsg
I remember I stayed up late at night these days,btohqsg
4am can hear the birds chirping outside,btohqsg
And its like probably 7am in Singapore,btohqsg
I tot i was dreaming when i saw the sky outside bright liao…but was pretty sure i saw the clock right,btohqsg
