It's either I sleep 7h  but very hard to wake up  or I sleep 8h or more and end up sleepy later,btohqsg
I wanted to make a joke but I realise it's wrong,btohqsg
Like it's so amazing I don't even know how to begin,btohqsg
You know it takes a talent to insult people and not know it,btohqsg
I think I need some telegram training,btohqsg
How do u even view deleted messahe,btohqsg
i still don't nkow howto ban someone,btohqsg
Euthrophication  how to go to Manage group,btohqsg
if soon kueh is no longer tele mod  there's no point of living anymore,btohqsg
@chemcerr u free for a 1-1 Skype session to teach me how to use tele properly,btohqsg
Wait were you just made an admin,btohqsg
Cause I want to leave telegram alone more often,btohqsg
What John doing at home doe,btohqsg
You are already watching 10 hours of netflix a day,btohqsg
kueh doesn't even talk on the discord server anymore,btohqsg
kueh is a changed kueh after entering NS,btohqsg
He posts on uniappresults every day,btohqsg
and how you would know that,btohqsg
Oh I thought y'all have discord server or smthnf,btohqsg
I would like to know also,btohqsg
I heard some people say the discord server tosic ley,btohqsg
Knowing that I‚Äôll never need this form because I won‚Äôt even get in in the first place is just another level of pain,btohqsg
It's ok at least you have seen it,btohqsg
I used to have sleep paralysis as a kid,btohqsg
But ngl the feeling of not being able to move my body while being awake is,btohqsg
Usually happens when I'm tired af,btohqsg
yea just happened to me hahaha,btohqsg
I used to not have sleep paralysis as a kid  until I started having them in my teenage years. Argh.,btohqsg
It is the worst feeling ever,btohqsg
Once I think I had 7-9 episodes in one night. Talk about waking up more exhausted than before you slept.,btohqsg
zz tg web is so lagy,btohqsg
couldbt send the meme on time,btohqsg
ionno without numbers don't think we will have thesehttps://angryloki.github.io/wikidata-graph-builder/?property=P279&item=Q11563&mode=reverse,btohqsg
This is why we can't have nice things like GDP,btohqsg
Ask a math guy on his opinion@cauchycriterion,btohqsg
is this a glossary of all math terms,btohqsg
That‚Äôs fair enough for some of the pure maths out there,btohqsg
Unfortunately huge parts of math don't touch numbers at all,btohqsg
set theory more like sad theory,btohqsg
Like  if all you know about 'math' is 'counting' then maybe you don't hate math  you just hate counting?,btohqsg
FWIW  people who need to be good at counting at are cOmPuTeR sCieNtIsTs,btohqsg
If your good enough at counting  you can invent addition,btohqsg
Addition was invented by logicians though.Without addition you can't count,btohqsg
numbers there are formalised using orders generally I think,btohqsg
And addition is defined using the successor,btohqsg
I'm not sure how/when did addition as an abstract algebraic structure get formalised though,btohqsg
ok wait I get it  hmmmmmmmm,btohqsg
By using you mean as the underlying set structure,btohqsg
"By my ""it's not"" I mean the part where the + binary operation comes out of nowhere  and is defined as anything that fulfills axioms",btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt know even an operation has to be justified,btohqsg
"it's more like""here are some sets andhere are some relationships we have among those sets!""",btohqsg
Wait  what exactly is the problem with the definition in the pic?,btohqsg
There's no problem  it's just that I don't see where + comes from,btohqsg
I mean that‚Äôs the whole point of the definition isn‚Äôt it,btohqsg
To give meaning to the +,btohqsg
"Don't you find it handwavy with the ""Now suppose inductively ...?""",btohqsg
This is the fabled ‚ÄúI can understand the individual words but have no idea what is being said‚Äù,btohqsg
I am reading the book now,btohqsg
Its supposed to be a recursive definition though,btohqsg
Tao is saying this1.There exists a left additive identity (he defines the right one later)2. s(a)+b=s(a+b)(or if you'd like  a++),btohqsg
And those are the basic axioms he's starting from,btohqsg
Interestingly he repeatedly uses lots of induction,btohqsg
You know this is truly a mathematician's book,btohqsg
My first batch came out horrid,btohqsg
Regret buying all the ingredients now,btohqsg
Damn if only this grp had biologists and not mathematicians,btohqsg
Medicine  so human biology I guess?,btohqsg
Im just a peasant who spent sometime studying evo-bio,btohqsg
Aka gender studies of the bio fields,btohqsg
I know some evo-bio but gender studies???üòÇ,btohqsg
You mean  genetic and physiological differences in sex?,btohqsg
Hahhaa one of the three schools.,btohqsg
No i am actually belittling the entire field of evo bio by comparing it to a worthless course of gender studies,btohqsg
Evolution can tell us quite abit though.  Like why do we have so few p53 copies,btohqsg
Or why elephants have so many,btohqsg
There used to be a copper based,btohqsg
Oh really... so similar porhyrin ring? But copper?,btohqsg
They didnt have a p ring tho,btohqsg
It was just a hexamaric structure with repeating motiff,btohqsg
So convergent evolution? Many species getting similar Hb in the end,btohqsg
Ps not an expert in this hahaha,btohqsg
Myoglobin affinity to o2 being higher etc,btohqsg
Surprisingly haemocyanins also have cooperative binding but that one i also not sure why,btohqsg
Or weather the precursors had it,btohqsg
But ik haemoglobin evolved a couple of times so possible modern haemocyanins just diverged from one of em,btohqsg
In which species do we still have copper being used as prosthetic group,btohqsg
They have similar dynamics? Like shifts with increased  paco2  erythropoeitin etc,btohqsg
I have no idea HAHAH i didnt study the details,btohqsg
Hahaha  I think the key to finetuning the human condition lies in studying other species,btohqsg
We have evolved to finetune our enviornment not ourselves. Just creating more weird selection pressures,btohqsg
Once and if we understand telomeres  inflammation  cancer and protooncogenes  etc etc...,btohqsg
Thats a very niche section to finetune,btohqsg
Plus the rate of change of selection pressure is far greater than increase in understanding,btohqsg
Hyperlipidemia etc.  Once humans live longer  maybe our research can be more fruitful as talented scientists wont die so early,btohqsg
You see uh.. half of these problems are as a result of rapidly changing selection pressures,btohqsg
It's interesting that SARS and covid is just 17 years apart.  As the polar ice caps melt we might see many strange viruses,btohqsg
Its actually alarming its only 17 years apart,btohqsg
It took 3 months for three strains to emerge from covid,btohqsg
Actually there are like at least 30 mutations most of which are silent mutations I think,btohqsg
But I guess 3 major strains,btohqsg
I not sure about that i havnt seen updated genebank hahaha,btohqsg
I saw a study like 1 to 2 months back. Said 8 strains but all silent.,btohqsg
By right this RNA virus has high fidelity copying but I guess not as good as DNA. Many mutations gonna be loss of function,btohqsg
It wouldnt be called a strain then,btohqsg
Yes that was like 2 mths back,btohqsg
No im saying.. if its a silent mutation.. it doesnr classify as a new strain cause there isnt any structural difference,btohqsg
Hahahaha cause u said 8 strains thats y,btohqsg
I didnt do bio for A lvls and O lvls. Quite difficult to catch up initially üòî,btohqsg
Oh ? It isnt a prerequisite for med ?,btohqsg
I didnt know that....i knew i shouldve just taken physics all along what a scam,btohqsg
Those @sg groups are still mass adding members from here huh,btohqsg
Iirc some UK schs require bio.,btohqsg
Ntu one requires u to take BMat,btohqsg
No need much prior knowledge right,btohqsg
I'm surprised how much pple learn at O and A lvls,btohqsg
It is my first time learning reflex loops  parts of the ear  gi tract etc. Like O lvl has quite a bit of physiology,btohqsg
I dont remember ever learning that in olvls,btohqsg
Mmm homeostasis shd have ba... reflex loops,btohqsg
At least for combined there wasnt much shit,btohqsg
Gi tract... like gall bladder  liver  cmk(forgot)   bile   gastrin  bla bla zz,btohqsg
Anatomy and physiology makes me fall asleep,btohqsg
Lol go listen YouTube videos about kidney nephrons . Guarantee fall asleep... brain blood vessels too tough . Get headache,btohqsg
I joined this group recently. I like the medical videos uploaded. Shd be useful for bio/medical students. Seems pretty legit leh,btohqsg
There's nothing wrong with the English? Lol.,btohqsg
Oh Haha which word was repeated? I am anal too üòÇüòÇüëç,btohqsg
I din see any repetitions hahah,btohqsg
Omg lol OCD... ya true ü§£,btohqsg
Where are u studying social science hahaha,btohqsg
I hate essays  but I hate med more,btohqsg
As in I love it la. But it's worse than essays,btohqsg
Hahhahaa I thought psych a lot of math,btohqsg
So first year  got a lot of essays?,btohqsg
I rather do essays hahaha easy to score,btohqsg
I almost wanted to do some science stuff but I heard lots of math so I went medicine on advice of my friends hahaha,btohqsg
They told me very little math. At most A level stats,btohqsg
Wonder how some ppl love math,btohqsg
Yeah its trueeeee hahaha at most some  very basic calculations,btohqsg
Hahhaa like I dont mind logarithms and linear law and some algebra but dont give me those sick uni stuff that I see on my friends insta,btohqsg
It's literally 24/7 studying even when u grad  but noooo dont give me math hahaha,btohqsg
I did some social sci electives. Loved it üòù,btohqsg
U mean like Korean and jap profs hahahhahah,btohqsg
Hahahaa issit? Okay la some can be quite good and meticulous,btohqsg
Yahahaha yeah ikr always see them working,btohqsg
Like 8 PM still in office,btohqsg
I heard ntu bio not as good.. not sure,btohqsg
But cant be that bad hahaha,btohqsg
Why would you even take bio electives though  Gpa sure drop,btohqsg
Its harder than social sci I think haha,btohqsg
Omg I heard so from my ntu friend,btohqsg
Hahaha jap and westerners are at the forefront of research la,btohqsg
eh yea their content is fine,btohqsg
we've asked them nicely to stop promoting like about 10ish times now,btohqsg
Like if you ask for permission we're usually aight if it's for a good cause,btohqsg
But they don't even ask for permission,btohqsg
Usually Japanese are very hardworking leh but they do expect the same of you too!üôà,btohqsg
U see each year got a jap win Nobel prize  minimum one,btohqsg
i assume acceding nicely to requests is a function of your ability to not be a douche but i'm unsure if they possess that capability,btohqsg
Like their population not super large but they win so many prizes,btohqsg
Compared to China and Korea for instance,btohqsg
i assume the sgcovid and sgeducators people are the same la,btohqsg
eh 200m is pretty large what,btohqsg
+ they industrialised early so they'd have more time to develop that kind of scientific culture that is needed to cultivate Nobel laureates,btohqsg
telegram is generally shit for modding tools,btohqsg
report so many times alr they also haven't done anything,btohqsg
tbh the most annoying thing is when they add people to their group,btohqsg
they scraped the entire members list the other time,btohqsg
AFAIK to shill the owner's GP tuition services,btohqsg
Omg I was added in too,btohqsg
Makes the group seem bigger lor,btohqsg
Tbh our Tele also low-key a paper tiger,btohqsg
2142 members but usually like 20-30 active,btohqsg
Omg that is unethical leh like having a veneer of altruism,btohqsg
any other factors you think are responsible,btohqsg
I think their emphasis on education also contributed,btohqsg
IIRC pre-meiji Japan had q a high literacy rate too,btohqsg
+ they instituted a system of national compulsory education early,btohqsg
i think gp tuition is like the least worth it out of all tuition services tbqh,btohqsg
Japan is 120 million and Australia 25 million population.  I think they are doing equally well though Australia is much smaller but I guess the sad thing is China and Korea dont really invent or discover anything worthy of a Nobel prize...,btohqsg
I guess Japanese also... have more connections with the west?,btohqsg
language could be a factor too,btohqsg
if English isn't your primary language it might hurt how international your connections are,btohqsg
Possibly could limit research quality because it limits the amount of collaborations you could do,btohqsg
Eh I think give china time,btohqsg
Like Nobel prize is a western thing not too surprised the west has some advantage? Counter to that is you see most textbooks is mostly western names being quoted. Asians rarely come up with some important theory or concept,btohqsg
They've lost a generation because of cultural revolution,btohqsg
I think China just needs time to catch up!,btohqsg
Korea only industrialised in the 60s-70s compared to Japan,btohqsg
I guess one big factor is that asians tend to focus more on money and practical stuff . Innovation needs patience and passion... so I guess westerners have that culture of passion and curiosity. Putting money aside,btohqsg
I think they need more time too,btohqsg
Plus I've heard from Korean friends their education system/unis arent particularly renowned,btohqsg
But this one need to see the allocation of research grants,btohqsg
It's kinda true for SG I feel,btohqsg
Like u see our healthcare implementation is very good. We dealt with covid patients very well compared to the western countries.. maybe asians are better at application rather than innovation. But time will tell once China catches up technologically,btohqsg
Usually my sister makes the cake  idk I‚Äôll look for her recipes later,btohqsg
Like focusing more on practical research than novel research,btohqsg
What temperature/ wattage did u use?,btohqsg
Basic science research in sg is not very good I think,btohqsg
depends on what you value :?,btohqsg
"from a nation-building perspective it's good because you're not ""wasting"" money per se",btohqsg
the resources you spend are those that improve your industries/competitivity,btohqsg
from a research perspective it's bad because you're subordinate to industrial applications rather than having the ability to develop wherever you want?,btohqsg
idk tbh I don't know enough so take this w a grain of salt,btohqsg
Yeah I guess. But then the powerhouses will always be more technologically advanced. Like Russia will always be good at missile technology than Singapore,btohqsg
Because they are the ones who invented it and keep many things secret,btohqsg
hey we have a lot of secret technology too!,btohqsg
Yeah but we dont have the space and missile capabilities of Russia  China and USA hahah,btohqsg
But I guess nobody wants sg to be able to fire a 10000 km range nuclear tipped  missile,btohqsg
Atb for alv PW results everyone :),btohqsg
I want Singapore to have nuclear weapons..,btohqsg
I didn't know it was coming out today,btohqsg
USA and Russian systems can shoot more than 300km in terms of airspace. If we procure them we will be able to shoot down Malaysian aircraft all over malaysia üòÇ,btohqsg
want to see how much shit mahathir is willing to stir when we have nuclear arms,btohqsg
but ok maybe not so good to antagonise the entire world,btohqsg
Some people suspect Israel has nuclear weapon lol,btohqsg
Maybe sg also has but keeps quiet,btohqsg
O but if we had we'd probably get fucked like mad,btohqsg
Its logical for Israel to maybeeeee have nukes I mean come on they are surrounded  by hostile  countries all wanting to destroy them üòê,btohqsg
Yea we have a very fragile economy dependent on global forces and engines,btohqsg
Ya but isn't the whole point of a nuke the nuclear deterrence factor,btohqsg
If you have but don't declare it's basically like,btohqsg
You think they win but u just launch a damn nuke at their capital,btohqsg
The deterrence comes when many countries are foreclosing into Israel,btohqsg
Damn I hope we have nukes,btohqsg
Dude I low-key wonder if China v US will force ASEAN to collaborate more,btohqsg
esp since now some of ASEAN's interests are directly against China's like in SCS,btohqsg
Imagine needing python to say hello to someone,btohqsg
I was typing gl for pw to someone,btohqsg
Then i wrote gl for python,btohqsg
HEY  anyone here in the media field,btohqsg
I would really love some advice on it,btohqsg
Or anyone who is interested in the film industry or other forms of media,btohqsg
good day to all  i punched my laptop screen and got a bsod notice  anyone has any idea where i can find help right now,btohqsg
idk if u srs or not,btohqsg
ok sorry for the boomer greeting,btohqsg
but yes im kinda screwed rn HAHA,btohqsg
u did not seriously punch it LOL,btohqsg
i got pissed because i couldnt login to my first lesson of the day and they logged me out of my sch email,btohqsg
so uhh like any other normal human being would do,btohqsg
i got sent to bios utility and the hard disk says 0gb,btohqsg
so im assuming i whacked the laptop  some drive came out of place,btohqsg
I would like a broken screen,btohqsg
oof ngl its all greek to mE,btohqsg
guys its official  you are immune and cannot get re-infected up to 2.5 years for most cases,btohqsg
reason why some people were allegedly ‚Äúre-infected‚Äù,btohqsg
time to start hugging one another ü§©,btohqsg
im really curious whats our gov‚Äôs strategy tho. if we don‚Äôt develop herd immunity how do we intend to eventually open up to the world again,btohqsg
theres no way this virus will completely die out and all it takes is one person to be infected,btohqsg
unless we are practicing isolationism ü•µ,btohqsg
Probably they are going to open up to a limited extent,btohqsg
yeah but as long as 1 infected person come through then isn‚Äôt that wave 2.0 already,btohqsg
Probably need to open close open close,btohqsg
That the economy might need to go through periods of opening and closing,btohqsg
actually i realised we never developed vaccines for a lot of epidemics so im not hopeful abt it,btohqsg
sure polio  malaria and stuff has vaccines but we dont have vaccines for sars and mers,btohqsg
its quite a hit and miss thing to bank on imo,btohqsg
Sike imagine graduating into a recession,btohqsg
imagine trying to go on exchange and looking for internships post-crisis,btohqsg
which jc alr know pw results,btohqsg
Well i got 1 year more,btohqsg
When you can find out that your friend who slacked got better grades,btohqsg
Good that stay at home to receive won't get flammed,btohqsg
shuld I vidcall my grp mates while getting back results,btohqsg
I high fived my group mates when I got my results,btohqsg
Nice I said good riddence to my group mates when I got my results,btohqsg
My group mates were nice persons,btohqsg
Such a shame we can‚Äôt see his wholesome face anymore,btohqsg
My microwave doesn't have a concrete setting,btohqsg
Wasn't results to be released at 2 or smth,btohqsg
Certain schs like to play ard ma,btohqsg
As long as A/B can le,btohqsg
Look at the back of ur microwave for wattage  find a recipe that uses the same wattage,btohqsg
My entire group got A (:,btohqsg
Think cos that year the qs was easy üòÖ,btohqsg
hopefully we all can have this experience,btohqsg
PW is a game of luck,btohqsg
It all depends on thetutor you get,btohqsg
Thats why u can consult other teachers,btohqsg
Unfortunately it may not occur to you to do so until it‚Äôs too late,btohqsg
And the popular teachers also might not have time for everyone,btohqsg
i refresh gmail until my mouse gonna break alr,btohqsg
damn the system looks like it was made in the early 00s,btohqsg
wah heng i tot i fked up QnA last year,btohqsg
It tells u how to check,btohqsg
Yeah never mind CNA says it‚Äôs either phone or email,btohqsg
did u have a principal address,btohqsg
people are saying it's by email,btohqsg
at least you guys wont have to see the disappointment in your teacher‚Äôs face when you collect your results,btohqsg
they probably know a long time before issuing it out thoigh right,btohqsg
cos they have to do all those data things,btohqsg
My teacher gave us a pep talk before giving us our results,btohqsg
half my class got B and i was on the wrong half,btohqsg
my friend ahveent redeive pw result,btohqsg
LHL will be reading out every single person‚Äôs pw result during the speech later,btohqsg
Oh  that‚Äôs much nicer than I was expecting,btohqsg
I imagined they would go by grade,btohqsg
how is it nicer there are like 50 classes ü•¥,btohqsg
mayday because your grades are crashing,btohqsg
When everyone else has their results already,btohqsg
Oh my computing teacher said scholarship interviewers or other interviewers know your actual a level score like 95-A or 68-B,btohqsg
i dont think it matters honestly,btohqsg
if you are in an interview already it means you have qualified academically  now they want to know you as a person,btohqsg
like how secondary sch management will probably need to know the scores on their end with the removal of the t score,btohqsg
Retaking pw was 1000000% worth it,btohqsg
i suppose only for the v prestigious govt scholarships?,btohqsg
I did it twice so twice the miss üòî,btohqsg
Thats why i do solo projects now,btohqsg
PW is fun with the right members,btohqsg
The sleepless nights and sleepovers and angry teachers screaming and classmates crying... was so worth it,btohqsg
Oh my 4 retained classmates say they cant retake pw,btohqsg
time for that 90rp dream ü§©,btohqsg
My sch got their results alr,btohqsg
reminds me of the B that I've gotten for pw,btohqsg
Its not even 20% done yet hahaha i still trying to overlay the image w elements and add ACTUAL projects insde,btohqsg
the first thing i read was this i,btohqsg
Yes  it was a legit allnighter. My teammates took shifts to sleep for an hour,btohqsg
lets see if my idea rlly worked,btohqsg
How in the world would i know,btohqsg
I was 1 hr late for a 1.5 hr lecture,btohqsg
how did you fk up his life now,btohqsg
and if they didnt score an a imma just say they didnt do a good job establishing my ideas,btohqsg
We started our GI 6 hours before submission,btohqsg
now you know you can skip lectures without people noticing,btohqsg
Maybe lecturer should punish everyone if a single person is late,btohqsg
And this is bad cuz I thought I had friends in my class : ),btohqsg
Maybe they know ur skipping so theyre hushhush abt it,btohqsg
Usually I‚Äôm always on time so I actually don‚Äôt want that to happen,btohqsg
Also  now I know that literally only one classmate cares about me,btohqsg
I thought u wanted to complain about pw ü§£,btohqsg
now you know who the real homies,btohqsg
thats all you need my man,btohqsg
my group leader is leading a team to shoot up MOE HQ once CB ends,btohqsg
nj A % is how much,btohqsg
Waiting until CB ends to commit a heinous crime,btohqsg
storm moe hq they cant stop all of us,btohqsg
Honestly PW is easy idk why y‚Äôall hate it so much  even if you have to tank the whole thing it‚Äôs so easy,btohqsg
Im the only B in my group haiz they got a,btohqsg
If anyone has any stats pls give,btohqsg
t r i g g e r e d,btohqsg
I just end up tanking the whole thing anyways,btohqsg
This yr dh zaikia ppl to pull up results,btohqsg
entire group got a fucking B,btohqsg
Actually you should go after Seab instead,btohqsg
My class also got one grp all Bs,btohqsg
This tells us all we need to know,btohqsg
Okok u can go celebrate urself,btohqsg
U wouldve triggered us less if u just said A,btohqsg
my friend kena B in a group of As sia,btohqsg
and he wasn't even the slacker,btohqsg
My op never screw up but my groupmates one did,btohqsg
In the end i B oso,btohqsg
U should seriously study computing instead,btohqsg
I dont want to waste my life,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt want to waste time making big bux as programmer,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like a 90 rp course now,btohqsg
Means it was ur wr that pulled ur group down,btohqsg
Not all censoring hides something sexy,btohqsg
Um seab is the epitome of hot stuff,btohqsg
pw is made to torture hapless jc students,btohqsg
srs ah i always tot it was 85,btohqsg
CS is a kool kids club now,btohqsg
cant relate  am a useless future accts student,btohqsg
Its 85 rp assuming people got c for gp and pw,btohqsg
HAHA but wont be surprised if it rly became a 90 rp course,btohqsg
my man said he got an X,btohqsg
X: your paper was refused to be marked,btohqsg
Anyone application got accepted too? üò¨,btohqsg
McDonald's isn't reopening just yet - it says it will stay closed past May 5 even though it will be allowed to restart operations.https://cna.asia/2KLC2GD,btohqsg
I wan buy my fillet o fish,btohqsg
nani i tthought its 90 rp,btohqsg
gUEeSs ThE WaIt Is uPsIzEd tOO,btohqsg
Talking about wanting fillet o fish but no McDAnybody remembers the time that KFC had a seasonal fish burger?,btohqsg
The only admission stats unis release is IGP  which comes in the form of AAAA or BBBA or something like that,btohqsg
Those always assume GP and PW C  so the maximum it goes is 85 RP,btohqsg
But we all know there CS definitely takes more than 85,btohqsg
KFC and burgers dun go together smh,btohqsg
hopefully it opens on May 7,btohqsg
buy 100 burgers and store in fridge,btohqsg
Now  no. That seasonal fish burger KFC had when I was a kid is way better than Fillet O Fish.,btohqsg
the best fish burger is pink fish at jewel nuff said,btohqsg
Since when did kfc...had fish burger,btohqsg
i wish someone did that with mcspicy,btohqsg
Am I too young or something,btohqsg
