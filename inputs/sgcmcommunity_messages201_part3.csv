Also driving without AC saves fuel,btohqsg
If u back all the way to the stopper  shifting to neutral release the vehicle being engaged in a pushed up position against the stopper,btohqsg
So when u engage P  it will be in a more neutral pos rather than it being cramped up against the stopper forcing the brakes in a engaged position,btohqsg
Ok thanks for for sharing experiences,btohqsg
The rules of automotive aerodynamicsBy bending the rules of aerodynamics  automakers can create low-drag cars that slice through the air  which in turn help improves efficiency.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 AMG reviews,btohqsg
But if u shift forward after hitting stopper  then is ok to engage P as theres no pressure on the rear wheels/brakes,btohqsg
Electronic brake n traditional hand brake same?,btohqsg
at long traffic light - have to put to neutral - hand brake on - then don’t step the brake will cost more fuel and damage transmission oil,btohqsg
Sg traffic light nt long enough to affect leh i feel,btohqsg
When I drive to work. Got 3… so total 6 min waiting alr. Sad,btohqsg
The neutral then P is not really for the gearbox but the parked position after u off engine.,btohqsg
Auto brake hold w auto start stop how,btohqsg
Think this is referring to manual cars? No idea abt this but doubt it will make any diff. Nowadayd all cars using electronic brake. Those still using handbrake r old cars. Any problem also can happen lol,btohqsg
Start stop is good if theres long period of stoppage. If turtling  better off it. Will harm the alternator if keep on off on off instead of saving fuel,btohqsg
traffic jam for example  every 30 secs move 1 car length  that kind of thing,btohqsg
Those slow traffic lo. Keep move a bit stop move a bit stop,btohqsg
Ermm not auto-hold? Need to step on brake?,btohqsg
I don’t use auto hold as I like the car to move when I lift my legs off,btohqsg
Not all cars have brake hold isnt it? I know mercs have. What else ah,btohqsg
So got hybrid car  this no longer applicable le?,btohqsg
Korean cars have. Jap cars have,btohqsg
Auto engine start stop is different frm auto brake hold,btohqsg
Cause I got many long traffic light so don’t know what’s the best way,btohqsg
Like engage auto hold  or neutral and engage elyrocnic brake n release brake?,btohqsg
I will never understand anybody who spend 100k on COE and buy a 10k car,btohqsg
Cannot find video on their TikTok,btohqsg
Nice. But as usual  KM specs r rubbish,btohqsg
The Ehev city rs will hit the sweetest spot,btohqsg
The hatchback city rs also a sweet car,btohqsg
As in foot brake hold. Not the button 1,btohqsg
Means when u stop. Press brake harder the car will auto hold brake for u without u doing anything. I noe i asked kia before they don have this feature. Neither does toyota nor honda have,btohqsg
Toyota Chr has it. Honda Stepwagen has it,btohqsg
Half the time the salesman dunno what they r selling,btohqsg
I ask honda salesman  city rs 2 discbrake and 2 drum brake?,btohqsg
But the car on display has 2 drumbrakes,btohqsg
CHR has it?! Then why does rav4 not have it? It is so much more expensive...,btohqsg
This 1 is what? Brake hold or start?stop?,btohqsg
Newer models maybe? But the 1 i referring to is using brake. Not buttons like the mercs type,btohqsg
Just press brake harder can auto hold le. This type still need press button kinda lame?,btohqsg
Its button to activate the hold,btohqsg
U nvr press  the hold wont work,btohqsg
U can on or off it,btohqsg
Oh.. then that makes more sense,btohqsg
Weird my inlaw rav4 doesnt have this button,btohqsg
