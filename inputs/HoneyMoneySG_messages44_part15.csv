yes if 'call' = 'mastercard' and mcc not excluded,btohqsg
In hotel. But also in general like restaurants outside. Thereâ€™s separate cashback cards for that?,btohqsg
Good to know! I didnâ€™t know this,btohqsg
Since no income yet  I can only provide general generic recommendation.Make sure expenses are less than the amounts u get from parents.Any idle surplus keep in higher yielding bank accounts.Try to get debit cards that earn u rewards when u spend.,btohqsg
Citibank cashback card May exclude certain hotel restaurant spends. Exact list I also donâ€™t know but I would play safe and not use Citi cashback at hotels. This is from my memory based on their hotel banquet exclusions (I donâ€™t know if still enforced).Non hotel restaurants feel free to use Citibank cashback for 6% cashback.,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone know of the best way to pay road tax while earning credit card rewards?,btohqsg
hotel mcc excluded from dining cashback for cards like citi cashback  ocbc 365  maybank family and friendsFor hotel  can use contactless cards like dbs livefresh or mobile contactless cashback card like uob evol,btohqsg
please name such bank accounts? Which bank should I choose after coming to Singapore? Can I get a credit card as a student?,btohqsg
If u need a basic higher yield savings account u can try cimb fast/star savers.I would not recommend u go for the more complicated hsbc Ega account based on your current described circumstances.,btohqsg
Thanks  is this a zero balance account or we need to maintain some balance?,btohqsg
Please tell about the credit Cards available for students as well? I mean without annual fees,btohqsg
You may get secured credit card and may consider CIMB ones,btohqsg
CIMB FastSavers account requires $1000 to open  but you don't need to maintain any amount in it afterwards,btohqsg
Saved  thank you! I have HSBC revo  will it work?,btohqsg
Have not shown up in online or app banking,btohqsg
Thanks but can you suggest a few zero or low balance bank accounts as well,btohqsg
Sounds weird. If your uob Kris already approved the others should be instant approval,btohqsg
GXS Bank  Maribank  SIF Gosaver  CIMB Fastsaver  RHB HYSA to think of a few,btohqsg
Why do u need so many. Just one is enough.,btohqsg
Aside from CIMB FastSavers:1. POSB My Account- No minimum balance- 2000+ ATMs islandwide- 0.05% interest2. Standard Chartered Jumpstart account- No minimum balance- ~200 ATMs islandwide  19 branches to deposit cash- 2% interest- 1% cashback on all Mastercard debit card spend,btohqsg
daily average tracking is easy if you have excel. I can share the formulas with you if you are interested.,btohqsg
Hellu! I understand best way to pay CC is interbank GIRO with HSBC EGA  but what about HSBC CC (like HSBC REVO VISA)  whats the most optimized way to pay for the HSBC CC?,btohqsg
Yeah right! Just to know the options,btohqsg
That's very helpful! Thank you so much,btohqsg
No problem! If you're trying to optimize for high interest  I recommend you go with one digital bank account to keep your savings (e.g. GxS  Maribank  SIF GoSavers) and a physical bank account to deposit and withdraw cash (e.g. POSB My Account  SC Jumpstart  CIMB FastSavers),btohqsg
So you are monitoring logging it daily to Excel? Can share with me thanks.But seems like too much micro management,btohqsg
Hi all. I've been comtemplating whether to even post this question here for a bit. I am preparing to send one of my aged relative to a private nursing home. The monthly outlay will be large. Don't even know how to find out the MCC of nursing homes. Anyone knows what's a good CC to use? Still sounds inappropriate to ask... Thanks in advance,btohqsg
yes if do contactless. 10x points = 4mpd or 2.5%,btohqsg
Everyone has their own situation to handle and no one is here to judge. Maybe can try uob absolute or if not available see whether NFP is available,btohqsg
U can top up NFP via nets app using absolute / TCB card at tap at the terminal for payment,btohqsg
Costs 50 cents per $100 Topup.,btohqsg
Hi experts just wanted to check if stores like adidas/royal sporting house are eligible to 4mpd when using the OCBC titanium card  does anyone happen to know their mcc?,btohqsg
For the webull promo  do you all open a margin or cash account?,btohqsg
If u are using absolute 1.7-50â€™cents u still gain 1.20,btohqsg
Use the dbs disable card trick to find out the MCC. Then give an excuse like your card having issues you'll come back later/another day so you can figure out which card to use.Else you can bring all your cards the use sth like heymax to quickly check on the spot,btohqsg
Hi Trazora  how about mile card? Does Maybank VI and Maybank World master? Do they get miles for education spending?,btohqsg
I try not to have too much activity for the card so I don't really have to micro manage. just need to use the excel to compute the amount of interest+salary to shift out every month so that the increase in the average daily balance is 501 only.,btohqsg
I am Not sure the MCC code but remember to use Kris+ app benefit to earn additional 3 Kris+ miles per dollar  and perhaps the 10% discount if applicable. You can check if it is MCC 5655 for Adidas n MCC 5941 for Royal sporting.,btohqsg
VI 1.2mpd for local  2mpd for foreign spend. World master at most 1x points only,btohqsg
Does amaze + citi rewards eligible for 10x of hospital bill?,btohqsg
By the way  is Maybank world master a Elite Worldmaster? if yes  can we get GHA titanium from it?,btohqsg
Hi is there any cash rebate using uob absolute card to top up ezlink app?,btohqsg
ezlink app don't support amex I think,btohqsg
Hi  how long will the 5% interest rate from uob one account last ?,btohqsg
no one will know. until they decide to change.,btohqsg
Just enjoy the party while it lasts. Once cut the rate just move out.,btohqsg
Hi all. Can I check for HSBC Ega bonus interest  if my current bonus interest in may - Aug  then I should trf all funds out after Aug so that I can participate in sep with Aug ($0) as the ref mth?,btohqsg
Yes. If only 1 human. Then u need to rest one month with minimal balance to reset the reference month.,btohqsg
In your experience  is it about few months ? Years ? ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
It has nothing to do with past experiences. It has to do with interest rate environment which nobody but fed can decide.Past experiences do not translate to future performances.,btohqsg
