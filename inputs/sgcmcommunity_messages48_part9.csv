they use synchromesh to change gear,btohqsg
Sue this website leh. Pete say wrong,btohqsg
F1 car don’t use sequential manual transmission. Formula One cars use highly automatedsemi-automaticsequentialgearboxeswith paddle-shifters ,btohqsg
It isn't an auto clutch though,btohqsg
they are not just automatics  as the drivers are able to select gears using the paddles mounted on the steering wheel. Plus  there is an internal clutch mechanism  making this technically a sequential automatic transmission  rather than a standard automatic.,btohqsg
F1 say they use sequential auto,btohqsg
sequential auto can use dct and torque converter,btohqsg
sequential manual cannot be used in normal cars,btohqsg
Mr Peter must be a vtec kick in hater,btohqsg
Somewhere in the middle I guess guys. Hahaha why are we having this debate again? - J,btohqsg
F1 cars r auto since 1989,btohqsg
Scroll up arnd 12pm+. Someone buay song why stupid ppl use manual trans 🙃,btohqsg
i think i wont explain anymore,btohqsg
i hope you dont get embarrassed when you explain to people,btohqsg
F1 history already stated they abandoned manual cars b4 1989 u still want to argue,btohqsg
@SGCM_Admini suggest you watch this video,btohqsg
Which stinger do you prefer? 2.0 or 3.3,btohqsg
2.0 is already enough for singapore roads!,btohqsg
The functions of sequential gearbox in a F1 sequential manual and Road legal sequential auto is analogous. The mechanical method of switching gear between a F1 sequential manual and Road legal sequential auto is not homologous,btohqsg
its 2 completely different method of changing gears,btohqsg
@Jingxunnf1 cars only have 2 pedals n don’t hv stick shift. So pls don’t say it’s manual already,btohqsg
but i rest my case. I do dislike the fact fake news and false information is being spread here. As this can confuse many people.@SGCM_AdminMany personal attacks are being made. There are some intentionally causing disputes between certain users and i hope action will be taken should any of this attacks continue to occur.,btohqsg
Maybe I should get a stinger for my next car 🤔,btohqsg
2 only n no stick shift,btohqsg
Wait just curious is my car dct the same as dsg ?,btohqsg
the clutch is on the steering wheel,btohqsg
I think this debate should end before things gets out of hand,btohqsg
I need to go pull rickshaw,btohqsg
And you need to cook food to buy stinger next,btohqsg
But straits times said it was going to be a rainy week,btohqsg
that was initially what i compromised on. But i do not agree with false information being spread around coupled with people using personal insults to prove their point,btohqsg
I carried 2 big containers to collect rain water,btohqsg
As a wise man said before,btohqsg
It definitely diminishes the reputation and authenticity of the contents in this chat.,btohqsg
Never argue with a *beep*. They will bring down to their level and beat you with experience.,btohqsg
sorry admin as much as i love yall but i gotta say some facts need to checked too haha,btohqsg
Yeah I went to Google it and watch the video that@Jingxunnshared. I declare that I'm thoroughly confused now and shall just take a step back from this debate LOL,btohqsg
It is a whole different gearbox altogether. Technology improves and we have more efficient substitutes of using the clutch,btohqsg
i have raced in sequential gearbox karts and single seater cars i hope i know what im talking about,btohqsg
Yes. Although I like iOS and all the way iOS phones Apple Maps is terrible. Took me to wrong places many many times,btohqsg
What I learned from this group is that if you wanna debate with mr pete  you can’t let emotions get the best of you,btohqsg
I learn better things leh. Half is full. V positive mindset,btohqsg
