Bruh I'm literally paid $900 a month to sit in a office and use phone for 6hrs...what a life for a intern + company don't want me anymore within the first week ðŸ’€,btohqsg
It is coz ppl reply on chatgpt for their homework,btohqsg
the test is stupid hence he failed,btohqsg
Had to get 16/20  got 15/20,btohqsg
Wait why is the passing so high,btohqsg
Getting 15/20 meant after my internship  I have 0% chance of being rehired,btohqsg
There are no stupid people  only stupid tests,btohqsg
There was a 2 mark  2 blanks question. You could only score 0 or 2. That was where I lost that one mark,btohqsg
Anyways not going to work for a company with no ot pay anyways,btohqsg
900 per month till aug  basically just excel all the way,btohqsg
thats like 5k without doing anyth,btohqsg
@aforaceis it bad that im going on walk instead of doing worÄ·,btohqsg
Yea plus the person assigned to take me to complete his project said that he is alr 90% done...so all I do is ad hoc duties,btohqsg
This is how much time I've spend on the phone in my 8:30-6 job,btohqsg
This intern will also affect my next sem gpa since it's graded,btohqsg
Omg I spent 7h on tele ytd,btohqsg
Some days my screen time also exceeds 12h,btohqsg
But idk what I could do to improve that gpa...my whole team is the lazy af kindLiterally feel like whole dept paid money to fkin lepak in office haiz,btohqsg
From what phone to what phone,btohqsg
ðŸ¤” it is not bad  walking about does help ur mind chill  im a bad person to be saying this but resting is also a part of mugging to the A levels,btohqsg
Im going back to my bench now,btohqsg
Jn i met my y2 jnr then she ask me about one boy who i nvr talk to in a while ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
I should jio my friends to homecoming coz i feel i will regret if i dun go,btohqsg
If a event only happens once in your life or less than that once a month. It's advisable to bring as much people as you feel comfortable. That is how memories are made,btohqsg
But i feel like the number of ppl who cherish their tm journey in my batch excluding the sc can easily be counted,btohqsg
But i will ask my friends nonetheless,btohqsg
