This one don‚Äôt say. Manipulated so badly,btohqsg
Yinda pump n dump. Sad case,btohqsg
Last day for ifasters to play,btohqsg
But actually there are many groups manipulating in market too lah,btohqsg
But MT is my worst experience,btohqsg
Agreed... Then I learnt 1 thing from MT... there are thousands of pennies out there  chose one that your trading plan give you the most accuracy.. for those that doesn't fit yr plan  like MT  just ignore  no matter how good the return can be..,btohqsg
My prediction. Can happen today anytime also,btohqsg
so what happen to fundamentals is the key?,btohqsg
I saw Yuan‚Äôs chart predicting the fall but iFast seems to defy the chart movements. False push?,btohqsg
if you read my earlier post  I keep say MT is one where FA and TA doesn't apply,btohqsg
only for another 6 months   other players can easily setup to manufacture face mask and PPE...,btohqsg
its interesting to see people point of view in MT.,btohqsg
at the end of the day  it is still because it is heavily manipulated.. from FA point of view  PE of MT is even cheaper than TG (I remember did a calculation for this year  MT's PE is 1/2 of TG)  but MT keep dropping while TG keep goin up..,btohqsg
I helping the other guy ya reply,btohqsg
U shld be hoping and looking to buy at this price .,btohqsg
yup im looking to buy at 7 series,btohqsg
Ifast doent follow any FA or TA or any charts or any rational decision maker. If bb wants it to fall sharply it definitely will.,btohqsg
Aspen strong bcos you got the Grant of Approval/license to produce nitrile medical grade exam gloves and natural rubber medical grade exam gloves,btohqsg

Most Malaysian mfrs know. MT Mgt old sch lah,btohqsg
MT mgt I think is running the biz well  but a disappointment when it come to selling the company.. imagine if MT was to come over every 2 weeks with small bit of positive news  I think price would have hit $3,btohqsg
