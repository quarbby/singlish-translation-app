coz i dunno what will happen if i disobey,btohqsg
Either papa mama bursary or go part time,btohqsg
i was in school  and spamming them asking if i could join band,btohqsg
ite sch fees for international students can go up to 20k per year,btohqsg

Ntu is 8k per sem for sg students,btohqsg
i told them  but they said NO,btohqsg
ok lah atleast got give bursary,btohqsg
Some other uni charge per credit unit,btohqsg
but who are they to say i cant cope,btohqsg

asian parents mindsets can be weird,btohqsg

Wait is he the one that says investment is pointless,btohqsg
I rmb u trying to say,btohqsg
and also  asian parents keep denying their wrongdoings also,btohqsg
And someone says lazy to invest,btohqsg
some parents can be manipulative too üò¢,btohqsg
they said i was selfish for not letting them go overseas during A level study break (but i mean they went ahead in the end),btohqsg
Ur not even tied down to ur parenfs,btohqsg
ok no offense but your fam is wild,btohqsg
when i told them my feelings  they turn defensive lol,btohqsg

"No bro I mistaken it for a mentimeter for ""welcome back to school""",btohqsg
usually the eldest child is the most neglected,btohqsg
they more lenient on my bro andsis,btohqsg
oh no and you did well for A levels so they‚Äôre gonna assume what they did for you is good,btohqsg

How is youngest the middle ground,btohqsg
The thing is even if u ‚Äúlose money‚Äù   its just the paper value of it,btohqsg
U dont lose money unless u sell,btohqsg
your sample size is limited to the kind of people you associate with in the first place,btohqsg
I feel that u should delink ur relationship to ur parents asap,btohqsg

"""cumshots that their parents should have swalloed""",btohqsg
Where is the beginning of this entire convo,btohqsg
Your dad happy happy cream pie your mon 20 years ago and here u are now struggling with life,btohqsg
And people are more happy to see the gain,btohqsg
Even though maybe only 1% chance of it going up,btohqsg
When u lose $10 u feel like the world gonna collapse,btohqsg
But if u gain $10 u feel like ok lor,btohqsg
it‚Äôs more realistic to set aside some money that you can afford to lose,btohqsg
yeah  got studies that say that on average  the psychological value of losses is twice as much as gains of equal magnitude. so the magnitude of negativity u feel from losing $10 is the same as the magnitude of positivity u feel from winning $20,btohqsg
Im v sure im a mistake,btohqsg
Ppl say youngest best of both worlds,btohqsg
