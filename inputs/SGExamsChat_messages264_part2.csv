It's safe to say we didn't even last  2 weeks,btohqsg
ikr now we are back to square one of this few nonths,btohqsg
Pretty sure the current situation is worse than when they decided to have HBL in may this year,btohqsg
I'm fresh out of JC and working as a student care teacher... I'm praying for HBL also,btohqsg
if HBL happens my contract will lapse and I'll finally get out of that job,btohqsg
seriously sia  I went into the job and the job description never said that my job includes washing giant metral trays and toilets,btohqsg
I'm done man  let me out,btohqsg
if not for the one month notice clause I'd be gone ages ago,btohqsg
Still a part of me thinks that no matter what  they probably wont implement hbl,btohqsg
I literally had zero idea about being a full time cleaner until day one of the job,btohqsg
I've been working at the place for 3+ weeks now,btohqsg
Last time they implement I think the covid cases was 50  but yesterday 170  they still never announce,btohqsg
Maybe they will announce tdy who knows,btohqsg
they say school not closing and I'm like what???,btohqsg
