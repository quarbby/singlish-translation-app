Hello  my partner has started working from July 2022 till now. When I applied for HFE  I was told to upload his May and June payslip  which he didn't have. I stated that he has 0 income for May and June when I was doing the HFE check. I'm not sure why  and do anyone of you encountered that?,btohqsg
is it for income May 2022 & June 2022?,btohqsg
Cuz he was still enlisting during May & June,btohqsg
I get stopped fill in HFE by error message stated told me spouse Nric not match. But I check is correct. how?,btohqsg
Can someone kindly help to advise me? As i dont c anyting reflect in Sales Launch,btohqsg
I think that we need to wait for an email in July  to see whether we got the queue number for applying the flat. Only then  we can apply for the flat that we want.Not sure why they reflect Sales Launch as such.,btohqsg
May I ask if I have done the HFE letter  will I be able to amend it in the future (before the appointment if I got the queue number successfully),btohqsg
