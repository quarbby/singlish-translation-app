All the CE peeps in NTU are NUS CE rejects,btohqsg
Up to u to learn only,btohqsg
And then now NUS CE probably quite high,btohqsg
Show that u not some anarchist,btohqsg
Ok so a majority of people not following rules?,btohqsg
That’s why they need the civilised A Level grads to lead them,btohqsg
Yes we are going to be that group,btohqsg
Chill la ur degree is just one line in cv,btohqsg
Bold of you to assume that A level grads are civilized,btohqsg
Some of them are chaotic evil,btohqsg
But is just one line ma,btohqsg
Ur education is useless once u get a job,btohqsg
Coz people value ur experience more,btohqsg

Then I not rly like too into science,btohqsg
Only physics interests me a little,btohqsg
It’s like saying chess is a sport,btohqsg
Well it’s just a thing on its own,btohqsg
But nobody would put it under the scientific community,btohqsg
It’s like arguing math is not Philo,btohqsg
Imagine coders being under scientific community,btohqsg
That’s cos they define it as nat sci ma,btohqsg
Same thing for ‘chess is a sport’,btohqsg
Really based on how U define stuff only,btohqsg

Accounting is fine but not like an exciting thing to do,btohqsg
