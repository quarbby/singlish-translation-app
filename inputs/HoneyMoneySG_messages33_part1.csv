okay just realised it does not mention citi payall  you probably have to ask the customer service,btohqsg

Wow Liquidpay cannot link to CC liao.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
only today? cos I was about to recommend to my colleague and the app asked me to update the app and it changed.,btohqsg
LiquidPay by Card is transitioned to XNAP app by Gpay/Apple pay,btohqsg
So it dedtct from gPay ?,btohqsg
Via apple pay still considered online?,btohqsg
most of you are talking about revolut  youtrip / amaze for overseas spend. is there anyone using Wise?,btohqsg
May I know what's a good card for insurance payment,btohqsg
YouTrip / Trust rates are often better than Wise,btohqsg
But grabcard cannot use to pay axs already,btohqsg
Amex TCB + GrabPay  Maybank Platinum or BOC Family,btohqsg
Aviva insurance think cannot use grabcard,btohqsg
Aviva is dead  now under Singlife. I heard Singlife can leh,btohqsg
that one idk. just heard got people managed to successfully do it,btohqsg
How abt UOB Amex + GPMC? Can get cashback this way?,btohqsg
Only 0.3% cashback. Amex TCB topup Grab get 1.5% cashback,btohqsg
So meaning we cannot pay via credit cards for those SGQR that accepts liquidpay anymore? How does the xnap app works? I thought gpay will mean it will deduct directly from the bank account  and not your CC,btohqsg
You can ofc topup with UOB Absolute and get the 0.3% cashback,btohqsg
Ic. Then do we still need to use liquidpay to scan those SGQR or xnap will work directly?,btohqsg
Does anyone happen to know what is this for? Is it the Cashback for UOB one?,btohqsg
can use liquid pay or xnap app to scan sgqr with liquid pay/xnap logo,btohqsg
For those that use card like evol might need to be careful. Go through liquidpay is online...but xnap/gpay is considered mobile contactless?,btohqsg
anyway  now that vis topup to revolut have 1.5% fee  what method do u guys use to topup revolut now?,btohqsg
Looks like UOB one $200 quarterly cashback? $200/3=$66.67,btohqsg
UOB is still processing my application. I applied on 19-Jan lol,btohqsg
They give Cashback monthly? I thought they only give it out after the quarter?,btohqsg
either FAST transfer from bank or Mastercard / debit Visa,btohqsg
Last November I got itThis is actually my first quarter I think  I received similar rebates last month too,btohqsg
thanks. can mastercard via apple pay?,btohqsg
I don't think Revolut accepts mobile wallets,btohqsg
Probably it's prorated for that one. Then it starts quarter cycle,btohqsg
seems liquid pay remove add card function,btohqsg
Hmm that‚Äôs kinda weird because my absolute Amex  the Cashback is termed as Cashback,btohqsg
