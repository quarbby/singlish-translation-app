Also if you take loan under family name and you got disagreement it can get quite ugly,btohqsg
Yea basically. It’s just silly to me when people don’t know what the actual practical use of the degree is and give it up just because they can get the knowledge elsewhere,btohqsg
Can self-study!! But it's only as good as a supplement,btohqsg
If not everyone can get qualifications already...,btohqsg
but idh the voucher leh starbies scanned alr,btohqsg
i thought student loan is 0% interest,btohqsg
self study is important and i do that a lot but without the structure it’s quite tough,btohqsg
and the proof of competence isn’t there,btohqsg
0% until you graduate then it starts,btohqsg
how do student loans work so confusing,btohqsg
my cher told me its 0% interest all the way,btohqsg
all the way until you start working,btohqsg
Tuition loan study loan different ah,btohqsg
so if u take gap yr after isok uh,btohqsg
wat will happen if u drop out of uni,btohqsg
you pay back what you alr took,btohqsg
I think my loan total 30k iirc,btohqsg
I took cpf loan coz my parents made me use my sister's cpf,btohqsg
take cpf loanpay slow and put cash into singapore savings bond,btohqsg
my interest now is like 4.75% per annum,btohqsg
If y'all good term with family  which my friend lucky to have,btohqsg
She took bank loan  then her mum help her pay first,btohqsg
Then between them agreement she pay back the mum but interest free,btohqsg
then govt pause interests on all uni Bank loan for a year,btohqsg
like once i grad they sent me a letter saying they’ll start charging interest from August of that year,btohqsg
Cpf loan bad is the interest starts incurring immediately,btohqsg
yea with the relationship i have with my mum and well finance things id rather just bite the interest bullet,btohqsg
i’m paying back 1.7k a month so i’ll be done by end of this year,btohqsg
no choice when parents decide.Though i could make a decision to take a personal bank loan myself,btohqsg
I had no idea bank loan was 0%. My parents insist 4% immediately upon withdrawal,btohqsg
entire family income also quite bad,btohqsg
ye so my guess is they’ll start charging you a few months after you drop out,btohqsg
the upside is parents can waive the cpf loan if they are past 55 I think.,btohqsg
im just hoping i can get scholarship,btohqsg
Yea then again if you good terms with parents you can do this,btohqsg
if not its a big financial weight,btohqsg
can i just say DBS was super stupid and not transparent with my loan repayment,btohqsg
But my ahbu wants me to use my sis cpf which I doubted at first coz she can use it for bto,btohqsg
if not how Gupta get his $15mil salary for 2022,btohqsg
i paid back 1.7k each month and then i noticed i’ve been getting charged late fees,btohqsg
can u withdraw only after u grad,btohqsg
But my sis insist it's ok!!!! Tmw she hit 35 she cry later kena chase out... Coz no money buy house,btohqsg
i call them then they say the window of payment per month is 26th to 1st,btohqsg
thats more than my monthly pay,btohqsg
And like my mum got a stacked cpf due to investments,btohqsg
so if i pay at outside that window they’ll charge me late fees still,btohqsg
And she refused to loan me the money yet pushing me to enter uni,btohqsg
so i must make sure i pay within that window,btohqsg
Yup money and family is weirdge situation,btohqsg
i considering if i shld be starbies barista,btohqsg
