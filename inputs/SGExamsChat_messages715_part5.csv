Wow ok I counted it freaking too 1h for me to calm my nerves back to normal,btohqsg
Yes I'm very clear  it's cause y'all were confuse with the old system still being used now,btohqsg
I will just try to stay relax but definitely easier said than done,btohqsg
ITE east  here is where we delve on the feast. Mighty and bold we will get ourselves a hold. We don‚Äôt vape  we‚Äôre just superheroes without a cape!!!,btohqsg
no lol. your entire premise of 80k per year was completely wrong,btohqsg
I said 80k over 10 yrs,btohqsg
second paragraph here. annual income of 30k (2.5k a month) and you're saving $60 per year,btohqsg
you didn't even understand what tax relief means,btohqsg
All I know is your pay lesswr,btohqsg
actly some ppl alight at tanah merah thn they take bus,btohqsg
i only alight at tanah to go airport lol,btohqsg
Well thats a first for me  I would expect more to alight at simei,btohqsg
Cause tanah merah has that stupid concourse,btohqsg
i mean it can be anyone that's able to afford the time. doesn't necessarily have to be people you're close to,btohqsg
i don't go frm tht side anyways,btohqsg
How to navigate you tell me,btohqsg
In a couple years you got a extra train to expo and changi airport,btohqsg
if im gg after sch lah,btohqsg
Have not been there in a few yrs,btohqsg
rebates on income tax come in after taxable income,btohqsg
but if no income tax is payable  no rebates,btohqsg
Anybody here that heard back from commandos already for enlistment?,btohqsg
Oh aight sorry now I understand,btohqsg
for $2k take home  which is $2.5k salary  it's $24k annual taxable incomededuct $1k earned income reliefdeduct $750 NSman wife reliefOnly $2.25k taxable income  which incurs $45 tax,btohqsg
but if add all the other reliefs due to children  not even taxed,btohqsg
So it's a major or minor step in public planning policy?,btohqsg
However  regardless of how many reliefs  max relief is $80kWhich means the mother can earn a lot  and after CPF and SRS hit $100k taxable income  still pay $0 tax after the reliefs,btohqsg
it was there all along for the past 16 years at least since I graduated,btohqsg
The old system was based of the income of parents but now it's fixed,btohqsg
if earn $2k a month  will even qualify for workfare  and get more $$ from govt,btohqsg
So this situation is unlikely to happen,btohqsg
From 2025  I mean when the govt comes out with all these policies  there bound to be delays,btohqsg
not necessarily  it depends on age of the parents also,btohqsg
the govt probably also thinks that first-time parents are getting older  and also want to get older parents to have more kids?,btohqsg
typically income is higher for older parents,btohqsg
Like the moe tier system announced in 2021  planned for 2025 implementation but is now being implementated in 2027,btohqsg
i've been constantly tired since y3,btohqsg
but today is a new kind of tired,btohqsg
Might be some health issues  would be best if you go to a doctor to check it out,btohqsg
NDU already sent out their letters,btohqsg
was wondering if the commandos did too,btohqsg
not sure what the govt wants though on it,btohqsg
But if I‚Äôm not wrong they‚Äôll send it out way bef enlistment to ask you to come for some test or smth,btohqsg
that one was done months ago,btohqsg
Man kids going to lose their parents earlier in life,btohqsg
üëç hope you get your problem resolved,btohqsg
if it ºs so bad until you can barely focus in class or study,btohqsg
ngl i feel like lecture pacing is too slow for bio,btohqsg
But its prob a me issue,btohqsg
Just saw Two ambulance flashing lights parked on the eunos flyover,btohqsg
