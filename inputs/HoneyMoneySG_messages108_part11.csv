Don‚Äôt worry.I did this @ Apple Store  LV and DiorAll sales assistant say it‚Äôs normal,btohqsg
I also do such thing.It‚Äôs the right way sis!,btohqsg
Waaa can cross month also ah  didn‚Äôt know that,btohqsg
Does ppl even know that alot of electronics store can do it,btohqsg
Only next time see if your face thick enough to ask them to discount LV bag from $3k to $1.1k üåö,btohqsg
That is not about face  cant afford luxury dont buy,btohqsg
True  the only luxury i can afford my phone üòï,btohqsg
other cashback can go up to 8/10%  but with conditions to go through like minimum spend lor  its a tradeoff.if you are just looking to earn something for categories that doesn't match with your main strategy/past rewards limits  this can work pretty well,btohqsg
Coz new phone 2k  my max cap for bonus miles is only 1k,btohqsg
They want to earn my money so why i need to feel ashame sia  i dont owe them a living leh.,btohqsg
Alot of uncle wear slipper and tshirt go buy mercedes de ok,btohqsg
Just realised hotel booking on Accor Hotels doesn‚Äôt earn 4mpd on HSBC Revo anymore while Marriott Group still does,btohqsg
Like i say before even warren buffet use coupon  so why need to feel lao kui sia,btohqsg
Ophan point loss I heart pain because all these are hard earn money,btohqsg
The other 1k in debt sia,btohqsg
Coz each hotel grp mcc different,btohqsg
If u accumulate 2 to 3 year still cant get enough point  maybe cashback card is better for u,btohqsg
Marriot is pretty good too if it‚Äôs available,btohqsg
I accumulate a lot until 2022 Dec. I redeem biz miles,btohqsg
Going kris silver lounge is really different ... when I have cash back card I never have the chance to step into lounge,btohqsg
Ya until 2022 and i dont know alot is how much to u,btohqsg
2021 I took my friend advise and move to the miles game. 2022 I redeem 42k for flight to hcm,btohqsg
Then where does the orphan point come in lol,btohqsg
By using citi rewards  1 year if u max out 1k per month  1 year is already 60k so somewhere along the line  some story dont fit,btohqsg
Coz 5k block to redeem miles but he got odd numbers,btohqsg
Orphan comes in when the scb bank changes its rule .. minimum transfer is 10k for transfer to kris flyer miles .. I transfer 35k to Sq account,btohqsg
Remaining 5k I can't transfer. I am upset,btohqsg
Most bank is minimum 10k block to transfer,btohqsg
for DBSWWMC quarter expiry (Those Expiring in June)  isit start june or end june,btohqsg
Maybe you can see if it worth it to spend to get the other 5k then transfer another 10k,btohqsg
I think I am missing something here.You still have the card?,btohqsg
So far I had never max out the whole 1k bonus cap,btohqsg
Cannot spend liao la.. later in debt,btohqsg
The highest I ever spend in a month 750 during Chinese new year,btohqsg
Then why you worry that bank lower their cap to 1k?,btohqsg
relax guys  he is just trying to say that there will always be left over miles that cant transfer  example you got 88k  only can transfer 80k  balance 8k stuck there. will take awhile to accumulate to redeem again.,btohqsg
When citi lazada card is gonna discontinue i also round up the point by spend to redeem in block.The lucky thing is i redeem all out with little orphan point  kena refund by merchant and my point end up in negative lol,btohqsg
U never see in another chat. Got someone sayRich people won‚Äôt need to waste time to save small money one..Zzzzzzzz üëéüèª,btohqsg
no need to scrunitise his word until so detail. read with pinch of salt. Dont get too agitated.,btohqsg
That's a problem when you want to cancel that card..  eg scb infinite visa,btohqsg
anyway ophan miles i will redeem for lame stuff. to clear out the miles and then cancel the carad,btohqsg
like my premier miles  got leftover 8k +  i use to get lendlease vouchers. then cancel the card.,btohqsg
Sis queen.. I just log into Internet ocbc . I can't find the travel under rewards,btohqsg
Please search ocbc reward redemption and click the appropriate link,btohqsg
okay thanks  then i can wait for my end may miles to come in before transferring.,btohqsg
if you read his chat from the past 1-2days u will know. and i dont think anyone is agitated,btohqsg
I am hot temper chilli human,btohqsg
if like trolling then just ignore lo haha.,btohqsg
Anyway I am glad to read about chris ... when everyone says uob preferred visa is very good.. he is able to share with us it's weak point... and also why he is giving up on this card.. thanks chris,btohqsg
U repeated this too much time liao  u know u can dm chris to thank him personally de,btohqsg
