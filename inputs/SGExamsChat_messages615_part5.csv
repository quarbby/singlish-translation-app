actl whats the diff between h1 and h2 geog,btohqsg
my syllabus and now the syllabus q different,btohqsg
thereâ€™s a solid 3 people or smth that arenâ€™t stupid,btohqsg
Once seen enough times   your eyes will start to become sore then slowly blind,btohqsg
my time h1 was lithosphere (plate tectonics  volcanoes  all those land formations)  hydrosphere (rivers  etc) + idr the human geog topics,btohqsg
I learn that for sec 4,btohqsg
Not non stop ðŸ’€ there's tiny breaks in btw otherwise my skin and I would break,btohqsg
the other is matcha who left,btohqsg
Disc chat has so many degenerates,btohqsg
the last is yomo who is a fellow physics phd,btohqsg
and he only shows up after work,btohqsg
Eh is it still Holi for u now or smth,btohqsg
I can speak old gen eng rawrr,btohqsg
Idk why but the few batches before me are btr at mt than at eng(,btohqsg
Now for the current batches it's as if their Mt is non-existent,btohqsg
Oh shizz I just read this msg  don't worry Mr Tan I won't give u that same exact disappointment,btohqsg
my phd is full time work but flexible,btohqsg
during uni breaks itâ€™s like i donâ€™t have meetings for a few weeks but am expected to continue making progress,btohqsg
if i want go for real holi i got 21 days a year to apply?,btohqsg
Out of 365  u can actually go on a vaca for 21 days omly,btohqsg
i mean standard full time job you get 21 days or so leave,btohqsg
ofc if you go on public holiday or weekend then no one cares,btohqsg
for me itâ€™s if i meet my prof weekly with progress + do my TA duties,btohqsg
he doesnâ€™t care where i am or when i do it exactly,btohqsg
I hear ppl discussing abt PhD and MD,btohqsg
It's diff but each got its own pros and cons,btohqsg
I think that's for med ppl,btohqsg
MD is like stressful af bc of the classes and how much they gotta study then got residency all those,btohqsg
PhD the stress comes from research,btohqsg
I see ppl review utube vids and idgi,btohqsg
for phd the supervisor and research group kinda makes or breaks the experience,btohqsg
Getting both MD and phd isn't worth it or smth,btohqsg
Need to invest alot of time and $,btohqsg
that was some things I read up on a year ago,btohqsg
idk if it's still valid or if valid,btohqsg
Ah the doc who reviewed that was based in us,btohqsg
in usa itâ€™s you do your bachelors then go to phd or med sch,btohqsg
No wonder I barely hear ppl talk abt md,btohqsg
It's cause of utube that I found out,btohqsg
med sch means you wanna work as a physician then if you wanna do research afterwards you get a phd,btohqsg
There's also few others or smth,btohqsg
people typically donâ€™t get phd in medicine without having an MD,btohqsg
medicine here is a bachelors degree so you get a MBBS which makes you licensed as a physician alr,btohqsg
iâ€™m avoiding using the word doctor bc it might be confusing lol,btohqsg
but yeah after MBBS if they wanna do research they can pursue a PhD too,btohqsg
I read up somewhere dat here in sg  masters are pretty common and no biggie,btohqsg
so like jc/poly (2-3 years) -> uni (4 years) -> masters (1-2 years) -> phd (anywhere from 4 to like 7),btohqsg
ppl usually take after working a few years if they feel itâ€™ll help them career wise,btohqsg
and a lot take it part time,btohqsg
Is the anyone who take for fun tho,btohqsg
