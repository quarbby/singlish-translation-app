Hi Gurus! I like to check on HSBC EGA Everyday+ Reward. I have just open the EGA with $2k in Sep. I want to use this account mainly to earn cashback on the giro payment. My question is whether I need to inject fresh funds of $2k monthly and if I can withdraw money over time for me to continuously enjoy the Everyday+ Rewards every month. I am unsure if withdrawing money will affect the cashback in Oct if I withdraw money out of EGA.,btohqsg
You can withdraw the 2k after depositing in,btohqsg
Great! Thanks for the info. Now I know I don't need to keep pouring money into the account. üòä,btohqsg

Anyome know why i am not earnomg cashback on maribank cashback card. I have been using it for months and mainly funding shopee purchases. Used it a few times via gpay for mobile purchase too,btohqsg
I recall Maribank cc cashback for shopee as shopee coins. Did u not get any?,btohqsg
Yes i get the coins. But it also says cashback for purchases. I also used it for mobile purchases via gpay. I checked app on cashback history and it says i never earned any cashback,btohqsg
Can clarify what's the purchased amt. Mari bank did state in the t&c that they will round down the value to the nearest cents. So might be it got rounded down to $0?,btohqsg
Roughly 200 to 250 per mth,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt change to margin in Webull as it states I have unsettled funds,btohqsg
Must I sell all my existing stocks perhaps ?,btohqsg
You already got the coins for shopee transactions  but not the cashback? You said you added to GPay  mobile contactless??,btohqsg
Yes i did that once or twice. Couldnt rmb the amount spent.,btohqsg
