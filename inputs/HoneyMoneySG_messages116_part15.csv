Planning a EU summer trip and flight will cost 5.3 k or 4.1 k SGD depends if Business or Business + Eco premium.I have only HSBC REVO  DBS Visa altitude and the Amex Krisfly classic blue card... any card u recommend I get and charge this to it ?,btohqsg
Am I right that ocbc daily average balance includes weekend and holidays? I am trying to figure out how much to keep the account remaining balance thank you,btohqsg
I want More Miles not Cashback,btohqsg
Yes but weekend/holiday amount uses last working day amount. Take that in ur calculation.,btohqsg
What airlines are you planning to buy tix from? If SQ can get UOB KF. If other airlines  can consider get general spend card and use this to meet spend requirements.,btohqsg
Maybe then I get the DBS Vantage and make this part of 4 K qualifying spend but as I am DBS altitude holder I doubt they ll give me 85000 miles,btohqsg
No way to track directly.Everything that isnt excluded in your selected credit card is counted.Example:Utilities excluded for all OCBC credit cards except OCBC365.So far no OCBC credit card excludes Bus/MRT so you'll be fine.,btohqsg
Yes don't have it   also the Krisflyer UOB is only 1.2 until they proof you spend 800 SGD/SIA,btohqsg
I think to get the 3x u ll need to spend 800 sgd/SIA so they give 1.2x first then toward end of year they top it up to 3MPD,btohqsg
I deleted my last msg cuz its not relevant to ur case (buying Lufthansa tix). For UOB KF  you get 3mpd without the wait for transaction on SIA group (SQ  Scoot  Krisshop) and Krispay. Other bonus cats then you get 1.2mpd right away + 1.8mpd (after 800 spend).,btohqsg
But I thought one condition to get 3MPD is to first spend 800 on SIA,btohqsg
no need to qualify 800 spend for SIA group transactions. btw  can your Lufthansa tix be purchased in Expedia? if yes  consider UOB PRVI for 6mpd uncapped.,btohqsg
Just realized HSBC Live+ & Citi SMRT covers almost everything except travel.,btohqsg
OCBC 90n does not award miles for simply go MCC 4111,btohqsg
