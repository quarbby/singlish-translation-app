Eh@ChrisHMSGyou simply must tell us how in the world you got $2500/pax for CC passive income! Its soo high! And you're going to beat this amount in Q3/QQ4?! The most I've achieved is maybe $1000 and that is with the welcome offers lol.,btohqsg
Are there any ways to hit minimum spending visa transactions other than tapping card with paywave. What about in hawker centres and paying back friends,btohqsg
Am watching the ACCM video now lol,btohqsg
Join ACCM and you will find out  shan't promote too much📙 Advanced Credit Card Mastery Course:https://hmsg.link/accm,btohqsg
Where you plan to book hotel n which and where you plan to book airline? This matters.Eg. There is DP shows that CTC or Hongthai travel are excluded from UOB Lady. Zipair is not confirmed yet as the mcc code is not in the range of major airlines3000-3299.,btohqsg
Hello! Can I seek help as to how I can apply for the SEP status so that I can do VC3A to enjoy the tax relief? I was previously employed by a company from Jan-Jun and I am looking to change my employment status to self employed as I work based on commissions so I can top up more to my CPF to enjoy tax relief,btohqsg
Can watch this video for SEP CPFhttps://youtu.be/9BE-3QaOc7k,btohqsg
I did watch it but I'm still confused as I am required to report my NTI either on CPF or IRAS. However  my salary for Jul-Dec 2023 has yet to come in so I have nothing to report yet. If I were to wait till next year  I would then miss the window to do my VC3A for 2023😞,btohqsg
I think your situation is best to check with CPF board and IRAS for official answers  as not many will have the same situation,btohqsg
I checked with them but they only provided me generic answers😞 Can I check with you  that for Y0  is it true that you are not eligible for any CPF contri??',btohqsg
For Y0 i earned less than 6000  so no point to VC3A anyway. But on the safe side  i assume if you are not registered as SEP (until Y1 next year)  you wont be eligible for VC3A tax relief,btohqsg
is it possible if i reported Y2022 income as 0 so Y2023 can become my first year of SEP?,btohqsg
You should report whenever income is recognized for the Financial year  not based on how you want to maximize tax relief,btohqsg
"i just do own transfer from uob to ocbc as ""salary payment"". anyone tried it?",btohqsg
ocbc doesnt indicate like uob one  guess if others have already tried  then seems like uob is the only lenient one,btohqsg
This ZYM mobile I have to wait for the SIM card to send to me if I going to port over from m1 ?,btohqsg
Login to OCBC web  it will tell you successful or not 1-2 days later. See the example shows on OCBC website.,btohqsg
Does this provide eSIM option? Did extensive research on this  understand only Circles  Gomo  and MyRepublic offers eSIM. 😅,btohqsg
when you register and select port in  ZYM will send you a sim card with a new temporary number. Port in will occur by 2359H once inserted. Existing number ported to ZYM by morning,btohqsg
You can add to phone and tap as paywave or pay online on shopee  etc as visa,btohqsg
Because ZYM runs on Singtel's network  they want to attract other telco subscribers to jump ship,btohqsg
