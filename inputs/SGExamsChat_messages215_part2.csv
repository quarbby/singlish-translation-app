Which nut doesn‚Äôt belong to the family of nuts?,btohqsg
that's true. people do think they are doing more than they are. they see it as a very big change on their part. so when asked-what have you been doing for our environment? they say: oh I've been using metal straws. but does that really create alot of positive impacts to the environment? i doubt so. so i think it's extremely important to educate others on how much more they should be doing if they truly want to help the environment. so many businesses have used commercial tactics such as oh buy metal straws and you can save turtles. yes it helps  but to what extent?,btohqsg
