Based on Transaction POSTING date within the calendar month,btohqsg
So if I made a transaction on 28 June that got posted on 1 July that eats into the July limit,btohqsg
Wah ok  that’s really helpful thanks! 🙏🏻,btohqsg
hey guys  i just wanted to clarify  for the webull cashmanagement does it work like a savings account? (capital and interest/returns guranteed)?,btohqsg
rather you trade it  better passive income thn just locking your money there,btohqsg
I'm not able to actively trade  I have dabbled in some etfs  but looking for some lower risk options that earn more than my back account currently. if works like savings account i don;t mind cause got big stuff coming up in 5 years  and the markets like that i no confidence when the time comes will it have earned or just flat lined.,btohqsg
Shhh... quiet now.Muted🦭.Reason:stop asking people to dm you for trading in my group,btohqsg
"Accounts like these from what I understand dont guarantee Capital / Returns (basically  like a MMF and other investments that u may make)The only one that ""guarantees"" if u wanna be safe is banks since SDIC-insured 75K.Correct me if im wrong",btohqsg
yea  thats why asking here  'm okay with not guratneed returns  but capital guranteed is important for me at this time,btohqsg
pretty much the same  but im talking about singapore banks ma 😂,btohqsg
understand haha ;;;  yea. i was just finding out cause their page doesn't EXPLICITLY say capital guaranteed. so trying to find out,btohqsg
I think u can look into SSB too if that' an option,btohqsg
Anyway minor add-on  insured amount will eb raised tor 100k from APr 2024https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/mas-increase-coverage-deposit-insurance-scheme-100000-april-2024-3790666,btohqsg
I have some in SSB current interest rate not enticing tho.,btohqsg
Unfortunately  everyone is trying to find the holy grail of investments:1. Very low risk2. High Returns3. Quite liquidUnfortunately  I think you have to choose 2 of the 3 :/,btohqsg
haha yea i hear yout. oh well its really fine. Worse come to worse i just put in bank for like 3.2%,btohqsg
Have you considered UOB one account? I think many people in this group keep saying its an effective interest rate of 5% if you have 100k (if you have the salary credit + $500 CC spend),btohqsg
Hi all  i have both uob one account and uob one card. I managed to spend 500$ on eligible spending for the past 3 months. Where do i see the $50 cashback from uob one card?,btohqsg
your quarter month is defined in your statement. Not everyone has the same quarter month i believe. it will reflect in the following month past your quarter. if not received means you did not meet the requirement.,btohqsg
I ahve  the issue is my spend  I'm currently running other CC and not really keen on jumping stright to UOB  for my spend (plus i dont spend enough to spread it across 2 cc ),btohqsg
to add on  my rebate posted in 12th of the following month past my quarter.,btohqsg
if you have insurance that accept card payment then no need jump CC. just make sure is >$500,btohqsg
Is paying SP services using uob one CC better than posb everyday CC?  Does anyone know?,btohqsg
HAHA i just checked  my insurance still below 500 i might need to relook see if can move things aroudn to still make it worth it. but yea thanks for reminding me!,btohqsg
if have then just charge to the debit card comes with UOB one account. (UOB one debit or Mighty FX debit),btohqsg
I try to use uob kris debit card on axs  it didn't get thru'. Privi Miles card got thru' & curious to find reason. Share it if any one knows  tQ,btohqsg
Uob one card had a fraudulent transaction & got cut off to restart my insur >$500/mth. so the vendor or house always wins,btohqsg
thanks for the tips!Just wondering if the transactions need to be via master/visa  or will nets spend also considered?,btohqsg
