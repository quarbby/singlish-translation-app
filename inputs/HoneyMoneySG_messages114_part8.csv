Hope their investing and redemption timeline is similar to moomoo/tiger. I can't really find their timing cut off,btohqsg
Like moomoo is B4 12pm for Fullerton SGd cash fund,btohqsg
just done subscribed to HSBC 8% Fullerton SGD Fund.. must hold till 10 July 2024.. It means i can only participate UOB Earmark Promo in Aug 2024..,btohqsg
On the uob earmark promo. Based on past year  do they refresh their promo every half yearly (Jan/July) or every quarterly?,btohqsg
so u will get $333 for placing $50k into Fullerton SGD Fund for 1 months?,btohqsg
from hsbc app or website  its stated maximum initial sales fees 5%. lol. could be just a standard 5% paste on every fund. so i suppose nothing was deducted when u placed the fund initially?,btohqsg
i'm half hearted to be honest.. it is attractive on paper.. but only for 1 month...,btohqsg
Same mah.. Moomoo also 1 mth 6.8% if new customer,btohqsg
No fees.. i just placed.. it shows 0 fees,btohqsg
i think the 'hidden' charge is the slippage from the few days of settlement IN and settlement OUT,btohqsg
How to subscribe and get this?,btohqsg
Just login hsbc to open unit trust account.. then place order,btohqsg
guys for FCY online spend - what are a few possible credit cards?aka buying sth online thatâ€™s not in SGD - say GBP or USD,btohqsg

Amaze+citi rewards mastercard for 4mpd on max $1k in statement month,btohqsg
I can't see any 8% return and holding period?,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone using cmc invest? I canâ€™t fund cos the bank recipient is too long to add to my payee. How u guys find,btohqsg
Hsbc new open AC  I start deposit money on 1st June  on 7th June I got everyday+ reward $1.69 in my AC  can I know what's this reward come from?,btohqsg
No issues for me. You only need the right account number  bank code and bill reference (your cmc account number). Which field are you referring to?,btohqsg
There's only UOB Absolute Cashback card.,btohqsg
You put A also can if you lazy,btohqsg
Is there any higher return than 3.7% currently? To be considered low risk ( excluding moomoo 6.8% ),btohqsg
Donâ€™t be feel half hearted  you become famous liao. Got mention in HM latest YouTube video.ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
Just ignore him and block him lah,btohqsg
Hi Iâ€™m new to HSBC  need some advise  I wil like to sign up the HSBC EGA account  should i1) first sign any HSBC credit card to take advantage of any new to hsbc credit card promotion. If so what is the best hsbc credit card promotion now?2) or opening EGA account first is fine and will not affect any promotion of first time HsBC credit cardThanks,btohqsg
Can do number 2 really. If you want credit card  consider hsbc revo as it has no annual fee.,btohqsg
Is moomoo 6.8 still available for existing user? I canâ€™t find it on my app. I never subscribe before,btohqsg
If I join today  if will be till 10th July right for 1 month and not 30th June right,btohqsg
I cant find it in my app too,btohqsg
Ya that is why I checking if still avail.,btohqsg
Hi have some questionsIm using hsbc ega and intend to use the 2 account method for monthly transfer and to earn the interestIf im on the current may/jun promotion (only deposit fresh funds on 1st jun) and if signed for the june/july promotion account for 2nd account  then the next promotion i can sign for first account will be the one made available in Aug correct (if there is one)So if thats the case i can wait till 1st July to transfer all money out to 2â€™d account or still have to do it before end June ? Theorticially the impact if do on 1st July is the fresh fund count towards the Aug promo correct?,btohqsg
if i got pending cashback on my EVOL  when i cancel will i get the remaining $ ?,btohqsg
Request to refund back to acct and see if cso can help before u cancel,btohqsg
Yes. Remember to transfer out of HSBC first.,btohqsg
Good  I just switched from uob one  I never thought OCBC is much later than uob for bonus interest.,btohqsg
Hi guys can I check   is I change the payment currency when I checkout on the Airbnb   will I be getting 4MPD when I use UOB VS ?,btohqsg
It must be fcy process outside sg and more then 1k sgd in order to be consider as eligible spend for 4mpd It is really tricky to know where the payment process gateway is for such hotel site,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn  so even i empty on 1st July for 1st account  the impact will only really be the first day funds counted as not fresh fund but it will be min. since its based on july full month of 31 days per the ADB? If i do it before end Jun  this month 30Jun is on sun so i need to do on 29Jun and 28Jun (Jz cos the max transfer is $250k for hsbc  will have to carry out in 2 days at least),btohqsg
Even if the  payment is charge to foreign currency  but the processing gateway is in sg then I will not be able to get the 4mpd too right ? Thanks queenie,btohqsg
Sorry I don't understand what you're trying to say. It's just account 1 in Jun  account 2 in Jul  account 1 in Aug. Make sure you transfer out of HSBC before depositing into your other account. That's all.But yes unfortunately self transfers are limited to 250k per day.,btohqsg
Yes that is the tricky part,btohqsg
correct  but you should be safe for airbnb cause even their SGD txns are processed outside SG,btohqsg
When I use Kris+  shd I transfer miles to KrisFlyer?,btohqsg
yes  ideally immediately before you forget,btohqsg
From the kris plus app yes for transaction that can be transfer to krisflyer app,btohqsg
Hi all   for Grab rides / McDonald in app payments  would it qualify as online spend hence using DBS WWMC be eligible for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Also  what are some of the best cards to pay on Shopback? To both get the cashback and credit card rewards? Thanks!,btohqsg
Anyone order confinement meal from Tian Wei ? Anyone know the mcc? Heymax showing 5999And cmrc canâ€™t earn,btohqsg
How come crmc cannot earn on 5999?,btohqsg
Hey guys  since HSBC nerfed mcc 4722 (travel related bookings) would using uob one debit be a smart choice to hit the $500 monthly criteria ? Though I'm aware that it doesn't work like credit and money goes out once the booking is made.,btohqsg
