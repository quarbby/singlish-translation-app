I say this only coz i know at this point i cannot help myself and my parents dun seem to be bothered w helping me out of this,btohqsg
They only know how to say things like i cant be in their payroll forever,btohqsg
I mean i also want the $$ and i also dw to burden them coz they hv 4 kiddosâ€¦i told them i alr hv interview phobia and instead they tell me like â€˜i cant avoid itâ€™  like DHE I KNOW THAT,btohqsg
I recall u tried the University Counselling Centre before rite?,btohqsg
What was your experience with em,btohqsg
No i went to external one but for a different issue,btohqsg
It was basically targeting stress and anxiety sort of,btohqsg
That one was a once off session coz my lessons / exams were alr ending,btohqsg
You can tell then about your parents if you are comfortable sharing. The university counselling service I mostly treat it like a vent session,btohqsg
Actually this whole therapy idea i heard of fr a friend who kinda had this same social anxiety thing as me and said it really helped her after a few months,btohqsg
If the external one is working telling em so can help you negotiate maybe a lower rate,btohqsg
That one was free coz it is a npo,btohqsg
But im not sure about the extent of their services,btohqsg
But my friend told me psychotherapy charge $100-200 per 1h session and it likely takes a few months to come to fruition,btohqsg
Hmm when u go out to work u should be provided some form of healthcare insurance if it's a big company too and that can address the non-supportive parents.,btohqsg
But they are counsellors  not therapist so there is a limit to the extent they can do,btohqsg
I know IMH is cheaper but the therapy is hit or miss one.,btohqsg
I think it needs courage to be willing to go for therapy session,btohqsg
Courage and drive cuz it's a weekly thing or bi weekly,btohqsg
That u gotta drag yourself to even if it seems like no progress is made.,btohqsg
My parents are like ditching my own personal issues and even health issues,btohqsg
Like they are not even worried at all when i was feeling unwell for 3m ++ after i recovered fr covid,btohqsg
Ah long covid is the WORST,btohqsg
I had to tell them finally that im going to the docs,btohqsg
My mum be like â€˜what can the doctor doâ€™,btohqsg
For mental health or like the flu thing,btohqsg
It is not really the covid symptoms lingering  my body just feels v weak  and i cannot walk up more than 1 flight of steps,btohqsg
The mental health thing  it was my relative who stepped in to bring me to her friend who is a counsellor,btohqsg
That one is a physical issue idk why is that a problem ngl,btohqsg
Coz my parents said if find sth  then cannot buy insurance,btohqsg
Like wth??? My health or $ is more important,btohqsg
Bruh lmao then what just never find it and let it get worst,btohqsg
Then they just gonna lemme suffer + all the psychological stress it brings me,btohqsg
Yea my friend went for weekly sessions for 6m,btohqsg
And she said it really helped her,btohqsg
The difference is her parents are supportive of it,btohqsg
My aunt booked health screening for me secretly but things screwd up when the appt message went to my dadâ€™s number,btohqsg
Yeah but what extent do u think they are un supportive tho.,btohqsg
U can probably request to change it to your number,btohqsg
Just call up Singhealth if it's government,btohqsg
Every time i brought up the idea of going for therapy  they brush it aside,btohqsg
Yea but i did not know it was still my dadâ€™s number being registered,btohqsg
Yikes they even control your medical stuff ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
I think coz i seldom go to clinic  then never change,btohqsg
Coz omo i just turned 21 fairly recently,btohqsg
I only go clinic if i need a MC or sick for long coz my fam stocks up meds fr retail pharmacies,btohqsg
Yeah u medically emancipated liao. That's the first thing I did when I turn 18 tbh,btohqsg
Just change the contacts to me,btohqsg
I told them the problem but they never do anything,btohqsg
For major medical procedures yes 21,btohqsg
