it is just a fashion thing you buy he buys and so i follow kind of buying suvs. females like suvs because they are taller and sit high up,btohqsg
malaysian buyers are followers. they dont have a mind of their own. they are not discerning drivers,btohqsg
it‚Äôs a global love for suvs,btohqsg
tat is what i like. press prices lower,btohqsg
Now I also see a lot of suvs in singapore,btohqsg
saloon cars a lot better to drive. mazda 6 is a big car  big boot space.,btohqsg
Saloon car  lower cog  more stable,btohqsg
Suv car  good when u are stuck in jam  can see far‚Ä¶ and also want to cut lanes  ppl tends to give way  compared to saloon,btohqsg
dont let females decide what car to buy. they often dont know well,btohqsg
My wife ask me to buy a Serena,btohqsg
I told her I rather don‚Äôt change car,btohqsg
hmm prolly gotta check the suspension setup,btohqsg
Personal preference  I prefer either a saloon or suv,btohqsg
I remember there's one that is 1.5....engine is like a generator to power the 4 motors at wheel,btohqsg
Yeah. Maybe the dampers are not good.,btohqsg
Sinkies are no different. A friend of mine sold his Camry to buy Nissan teana. Now you tell me how much does he know know about car. I asked him go check out Alfa,btohqsg
if he sold his old Camry to get a new Camry still okay leh,btohqsg
Many don‚Äôt even know what trans the car has. They have closed minds la.,btohqsg
His decision is based on hearsay. If he had open mind he would have tested Alfa abs many others.,btohqsg
"mazda salesman told me many who tested mazda 6 are happy with the car saying it is good car. but as soon as they go home and friends and wives tell them not to buy mazda but only toyota  their minds are changed. ""aiya why mazda  toyota is the best. best resale value""",btohqsg
Italian not easy to maintain leh...eat pizza and pasta,btohqsg
Japanese cheaper cost also eat rice...,btohqsg
i aint mazda salesman. i changed toyota vios to mazda. because while vios is a good daily car it is boring and goes straight line only. germans call toyotas kitchen appliance cars. they would never buy toyota.,btohqsg
not. not at all. they are very reliable.,btohqsg
i'd say cheaper than bmw to maintain,btohqsg
so between mazda and toyota? both reliable but mazda way more enjoyable and stylish,btohqsg
Then mazda  Toyota and Honda leh,btohqsg
hodna only the type r is good,btohqsg
subaru is good. yes. enjoyable too,btohqsg
Never drive a subaru before  but my colleague bought a subaru instead of mazda  cuz she feels that mazda signal sound like taxi,btohqsg

a friend of mine works in toyota AP. he says toyota is led by traditional old men old fashioned making boring cars. but beginning to change gradually,btohqsg
i drove my friend's subaru wrx. a really good car. hjigh quality and comfortable daily driver,btohqsg
this one is too front heavy. i drove this for a while.,btohqsg
alfa starting with the giulia is a seriously good car,btohqsg
i told a bmw salesman that mazda is a good car. he says oh sure they copy bmw... haha,btohqsg
veloce is a good car. i tested it,btohqsg
if 120k can buy. better than a new bezza,btohqsg
malaysians will laugh at you when you buy a new bezza,btohqsg

What is ‚Äúold‚Äù power car? And is it ‚Äúcheap‚Äù?,btohqsg
üòù for the price of Bessel I think many 200 bhp car can be bought. Of course with a much shorter paper life compare to new cars,btohqsg
https://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1090396. 2025 coe down turn will return. 78k for a wrx seem like a good tie over,btohqsg
Just my simple thought . Using a car with high coe really issnt pocket friendly in the long run,btohqsg
