Im genuinely worried for year 2,btohqsg
Courage doesn't come in the form of weird af integrals,btohqsg
Year 1 math ez but year 2 wld be a nightmare for me,btohqsg
My o lvl prelims a math 9%,btohqsg
So y2 they focus on promos and h1 contrast only,btohqsg
but the one after my batch is yes,btohqsg
Wait so u oso 90rp ah,btohqsg
Literally everything scary about y2 is taken away,btohqsg
Now y2 you only need to focus on promoting,btohqsg
I still need get A for everything tho,btohqsg
I hear snr saying ‚Äúeh i got U for chem my physics also‚Äù,btohqsg
This makes me want to rethink my life choices,btohqsg
If there are seniors who can juggle pw + h1 contrast and still get A for all their 3H2 in y2,btohqsg
Cuz i could hav retained in y2,btohqsg
then dh to count h1 + pw,btohqsg
Idn worry abt pw now at least,btohqsg
which will help me in the long run,btohqsg
Cant change the past anymore so just do well for your H2s,btohqsg
I alr feel the urge to create fake id go zouk and marquee alr,btohqsg
now i have to 90 then rebase to 70,btohqsg
Aiya my mid years y3 also all U,btohqsg
They hype the paper until like üíÄüíÄq,btohqsg

Lemme dig out my exam results,btohqsg
dig out later during the day luh,btohqsg
Nah its just under my desk,btohqsg
my prelims in jc was like U for chem and S for math and h1 geog,btohqsg

Lmao and this wasnt even that bad for me,btohqsg
once i grad i‚Äôll legit frame it next to a level results,btohqsg
it‚Äôll be quite funny and ironic,btohqsg
I still made it to NTU,btohqsg
doing my phd in physics rn,btohqsg
i dont think i can even get an E,btohqsg
They pay you to do that right,btohqsg
Which is what id like to do anyway,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why it‚Äôd be funny to have my doctorate next to shit a level results,btohqsg

i think that‚Äôs about the cutoff,btohqsg
had to do a test for it,btohqsg
probs bc physics A math E ba,btohqsg
Anyone wan refer me to prof so i can be research assistant üòçüòçüòç,btohqsg
And then you have to answer short ans questions,btohqsg
My EC rn is so shit idt i can even make it to a mediocre US uni,btohqsg
