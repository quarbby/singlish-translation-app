You can write about your skill you attained  from the competitions you took part then write how it can help you bring forward?,btohqsg
I didn't wanna say that but Ty,btohqsg
side projects that have some significance may work.eg if you have written an app that has been published and adopted by a few thousand people at least,btohqsg
else side projects are a plenty,btohqsg
exactly  so the projects that I built are my only glimpse of hope,btohqsg
But it needs to be popz,btohqsg
I can also say I do 20+ apps alr,btohqsg
There's an idea I have though that you could try.Present the projects on videoupload on YouTube and explainShowcase your video in your application,btohqsg
"There is always that ""so what makes you stand out even after you do it""",btohqsg
But you cannot post links in eae ah HAHA,btohqsg
no one else does a YouTube video,btohqsg
saying only. it's more on ideas to stand out.ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
last time I did a project in NUS using collected McDonald's straws.I added Special Thanks to McDonald in my ending PowerPoint slides ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
it did bring some laughter and struck an impression I guess. Scored A,btohqsg
Being different is always better than being better.,btohqsg
Its all about the creativity in your 600character counts,btohqsg
in any interviews  it's always why you and why not others.,btohqsg
Just be selfish in eae and talk abt yourself and not others :),btohqsg
thatâ€™s true  IT course is quite competitive so maybe just apply and pray for the best,btohqsg
Ok  I will consider about this. Thank you for ur advice madam,btohqsg
:))) later they think i am self-centered ðŸ¥¹,btohqsg
good idea tho  btw can i bring my laptop during the interview if I get selected ?,btohqsg
Then they access from their side,btohqsg
ahh okay  thank you. I have a clearer picture now. My friends are applying either dsa or eae so Im kinda fomo so just wanna give it a try,btohqsg
that was my mistake when I failed dozens of scholarship interviews in the past,btohqsg
now that have a bit more time  type a hit more. It was a project on creating a model of Buckminsterfullerene.So I used straws. And to ensure I stood out in the presentation  I threw the model around to showcase stability.,btohqsg
This was because other teams were using soldered iron bars or cardboards   so I know they can't do the same thing.,btohqsg
yes indeed  I think itâ€™s good to be thick face in the right place at the right time tho,btohqsg
uh guys how to get achievement points for cca bonus points,btohqsg
o I tot is und leadership instead,btohqsg
achievement points is represent school in competition,btohqsg
okay.. den now my achievement is level 3 for nsg for cdiv  they have yet to add in nsg for bdiv  is it possible that my achievement can be pushed to level 4,btohqsg
should be since its 3 years,btohqsg
do you know how many u have represented ur sch in nsg?,btohqsg
is c and b div biannual ðŸ˜°,btohqsg
im in perf arts so idk how nsg works HAHA,btohqsg
cause i got a friend who represented for bdiv for 2 years (sec 3 & sec 4),btohqsg
Isn't C B & A Divs annual?,btohqsg
Hi. You â€˜re so full of energy!,btohqsg
HHA yeah cdiv for me is sec1  then bdiv is Sec4,btohqsg
u can get level 4 if you get top 4 team placing or top 8 individual placing for two years as mentioned,btohqsg
but if you represent only for 2 years  it's level 3,btohqsg
Ah yeah no  my schools far from that HAHA,btohqsg
