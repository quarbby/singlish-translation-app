yeah stereo type ah.. some girls can drive really well too.. might even win guys at shifting the stick,btohqsg
that's right! More females are getting into the car scene these days  and  some of them drive manual JDM cars,btohqsg

If diesel or petrol  not that high consumption rite? Based on my experience I pump after a day and half,btohqsg

That's rite! I wonder what's the incentive if we adopt EVs and have to spend more time charging our vehicle than charging our phones üòÇ,btohqsg
IMO electric car technology is in the high growth phase  like mobile phones 15 years ago. Every 1-2 years the tech improves dramatically. Eventually like the way phones are now  tech will plateau and 1-2 years old cars wont look like dinosaur tech,btohqsg
thats when i will go to EVs. too much early adopter pains to do so right now IMO,btohqsg
This only applies to Malaysian car going into Singapore correct,btohqsg
