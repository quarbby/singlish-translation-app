has anyone managed to waive dbs women world card spending < 25k?,btohqsg
Yes. If online waiver request is rejected  call the dbs Hotline and request to speak to a banking officer to appeal for waiver. My waiver request for dbs wwmc annual fee was approved this way. (the more difficult part is navigating through the automated phone system),btohqsg
I've done a video on credit card fees and it  will answer most of your questions on fee waiver,btohqsg
No. Lump sum in next month only,btohqsg
Hi anybody knows usually when UOB One quarterly cashback comes in?,btohqsg
Thanks  I understand itâ€™s excluded for cash back on UOB one Cc spent  but does it quality it for spending required for One account interest crediting?,btohqsg
It has come for me already for Q4 22,btohqsg
So likely after your cc statement date for jan,btohqsg
credited only if u have balance to be offset on end of 4th or later statement month,btohqsg
bigger issue is u will not have enough points to redeem for miles before points expiry in 1 year. Think fee waiver is not an issue,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s a good card for infrequent purchases over 1k and hotel bookings? To be coupled with citi rewards? Have my strategy been ruined? Ideally prefer to stay 2 cards and under.,btohqsg
DBS altitude. 3mpd for online travel related bookings with no miles expiry,btohqsg
But i would add that having only 2 cards cannot make an optimal mile strategy,btohqsg
okay  thats the best right  dont have to be miles also okay. yea  dont have to be optimal  just want to make sure my big purchases dont go wasted  just want a convienient and simple strategy,btohqsg
Do you know if our statement month for UOB one begins from 13 dec to 12 jan  does it count as part of Q4 2022  or Q1 2023?,btohqsg
Oh i thot for everyone quarter is same just the statement date varies,btohqsg
Like it will be oct nov dec just the dates will be different,btohqsg
no. can be month 123 234 345. anyway can check ur statement for ur quarter. Statement on 12 Jan is Jan statement,btohqsg
If I convert to miles with a Citi CC  and then convert to miles with a DBS CC  can I combine and purchase a 2 way ticket? Or no?,btohqsg
No matter what cards u convert also will end up as miles eg KF miles. It up to you to buy 1 way or 2 way.,btohqsg
Which account? U mean u do 1 Asia miles then another one krisflyer?,btohqsg
Can combine both into one single KrisFlyer miles account,btohqsg
ahh okay  so when you convert  you can choose which account u want convert to  smth like that,btohqsg
u can only have one krisflyer account  one asia miles account. Can choose to convert points to kf miles or asia miles,btohqsg
Hi all  may I ask if I have an installment plan on HSBC revolution  does it eat into the $1000 monthly limit for 4MPD?,btohqsg
SianThe absolute to grab top up on 14th posted date was 16th. So only can get 0.3%?):,btohqsg
If u do it in e morning of 14 Jan  it will be posted as 14 Jan. After 12pm it will be posted as 16 Jan. I happened to do both n it showed like this. Anyway partyâ€™s over for now  so take the 0.3% is also better than 0. Lol,btohqsg

So for example if I have a 200 per month installment  I can still spend additional 1000 for the 4MPD category instead of only 800 since installment does not earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
installment dont count towards rewards  mostly exclude themin short  yes u can still spend 1000,btohqsg
Great.. thatâ€™s what I wanted to know .. thanks ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
Was afraid that if I have installments then I wonâ€™t be able to utilise the full 1000 for 4mpd,btohqsg
u can check the TnC for HSBC revo  i think should have written somewhere what are excluded,btohqsg
ohhh dam  so best to avoid instalment? since theres no rewards,btohqsg
hmm  im not very sure.perhaps others can give a better sharing on this,btohqsg
bcos i was thinking of taking up installment so that i wont exceed the 1k treshold,btohqsg
spread the payment across a few cards?,btohqsg
for eg  if i buy a macbook for 2k  i would exceed the 1k limit  but if i pay in installment of $200 every month  i wont,btohqsg
but if like you said  installments are not given rewards  then no point alrd,btohqsg
i mean  spread the payment across 2 cards  for example  pay 1k on CRMC and 1k on Revo,btohqsg
Yup spread it among different card,btohqsg
payment is only through one card,btohqsg
