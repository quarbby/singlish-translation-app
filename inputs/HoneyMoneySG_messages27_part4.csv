You have to sign-up via Citi Official Affiliate link herehttps://hmsg.link/citicardsBut doing so will forfeit you from Singsaver rewardsCiti Rewardshttps://hmsg.link/citirewards,btohqsg
i usually search for it within my emails,btohqsg
Everytime you sign up for a new CC  got free credit report from credit bureau.The dates of opening and closing your various CCs are stated in there  every single one of them,btohqsg

should I open DBS Womenâ€™s Card for one time big purchases or flight + hotel booking?,btohqsg
or are the fees unwaivable if I donâ€™t spend near 2k,btohqsg
If I understand your question  you are asking if you have priority pass visit every year? Yes  you get two free visits per year (actual dates you can use the visit depends on your card  unlike Citibank Premiermiles which is per calendar year) as long as you are still holding the DBS Altitude Card,btohqsg
After they are posted to your account,btohqsg
yeap  but its marked as pending,btohqsg
Yep posted means it will not be pending anymore  usually once the merchant claims the amt from the bank  it will be posted to your account and youâ€™ll get the points,btohqsg
should i have another card to pay for travel + booking? or should i just forfeit,btohqsg
Thanks Edwin! I realised I didnâ€™t update to the latest app version,btohqsg
