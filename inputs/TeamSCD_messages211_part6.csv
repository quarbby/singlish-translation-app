Thinner sidewalls make the car sportier and improves the handling. Thicker side walls provide slightly better comfort. You could argue that sometimes  having thicker sidewalls actually make some cars look better too. :D,btohqsg
Then the rims need either deepdish or chrome mirror,btohqsg
you need to make it look like nascars or what,btohqsg
