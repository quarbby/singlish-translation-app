A uni education was never about the degree,btohqsg
It's about training your thinking processes,btohqsg
when I was still in an MNC  I asked my supervisor why my job actually quite simple  why can't get poly grads to do. The company hires both.He said based on his years of observations and experience  it's because the thinking is different. Poly grads are generally not able to handle the professional judgment required for the job scope.,btohqsg
More applicable for fresh grads than those with more experience.,btohqsg
that's why it's only more applicable for fresh grads,btohqsg
but it also depends on the job scope,btohqsg
you wouldn't want a pharmacist to treat your illness after the pharmacist has years of observing what a doctor did  regardless of experience.,btohqsg
but generally  to reach those high level positions  unless it's the founder of the company or a family business  non uni grads mostly not able to climb that high  regardless of capability.Fact of society.,btohqsg
then again  position doesn't determine success in life.There are so many factors to it  and each person has their own definitions,btohqsg
