Big country can lahh. Small country like SG how to compete? So many players already.,btohqsg
I hope defu one convert to petrol in the future 😹,btohqsg
Don't need sign up for the v day project 1 lah. If no1 sign up  they will throw out the job in the app. Them just don't take first. If no1 take then as the date gets nearer they will +++. Earn much more lor then if u take the job under the project. Every yr v day also like that.,btohqsg
But now got those bangla etc  illegally do llm so don't know if they take the project or not lah,btohqsg
Special festive days/period must wait for +++ or surge or else normal days the price so shit,btohqsg
HaizTime so bad right now to earn extra money,btohqsg
The delivery industry now so saturated. There's not enough deliveries to sustain many drivers lah,btohqsg
aiya... in pinoyland only... i tot sg,btohqsg
What are u supposed to do with this?,btohqsg
Can go office tomorrow to appeal or email in. Worth a try.,btohqsg
Do you what what's the lalamove email for riders to email in for enquiry?,btohqsg
I haven't done it for few months and login to this haha,btohqsg
Good luck for anyone getting macdonalds order today got new menu,btohqsg

That's y nvr take their project. Fare so low.,btohqsg
Good day bro and sister  how the flower biz today ? Happy V day and Safe drive 😄,btohqsg
Do we need to use the lalamove bag for deliveries or the black one can already. For motorbike,btohqsg
Weird. I didn’t receive the CPF,btohqsg
U don't have deposit in it how to have account working? Chance for u start make more money with other platforms and stop charity,btohqsg
How much they earn but not putting in to our cpf,btohqsg
Hi my account got suspended til monday i cashed out just now..will it be credited to my bank on weds?..,btohqsg
I don’t think it’ll affect your cash out unless you cash out before you got suspended. 🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
Before this order is picked up ppl,btohqsg
Wah now have earning slip ah,btohqsg
guys is the cpf withholding for every job will be topup to our medisav?i counted and there’s a hugedifference.ami missing anything?,btohqsg
Mine go medisave cos I nvr opt in for cpf contribution,btohqsg
If u got  shld go to oa n medisave bah,btohqsg
Heavy rain fee like 💩 sleep better 🤣,btohqsg
OA  SA and MA all will have contribution based on your age group.,btohqsg
Depends on whether you got opt in or not for the cpf scheme,btohqsg
Just wondering if anyone talk about this before   if we not working we should go “offline” if we “on duty” but not working the fees “generated” will consider the number of people “on duty” hence if many “on duty” the fees will be cbai ammt because many people even not working also on the app.,btohqsg
Any logic to this ? I agakration only lah,btohqsg
The fees not determined by that,btohqsg
Fees determine by customers of this charitable organization,btohqsg
I suggest base price starts from 0. Let the price be like auction. Believe there are some who are willing to deliver even at $2,btohqsg
The medisave fees also like buay zhun,btohqsg
I did 30+ orders roughly 30-$40 medisave,btohqsg
I only get $11 for jan😂,btohqsg
Troublesome though have to count the amt deducted for each job for cpf 😅,btohqsg
Of course so many other factors lah   distance mainly the factor   end of day demand supply also play a part   if all “on duty” the charges for high demand low   if less people working high demand certain areas then the fees high .. this my logic lah,btohqsg
Mine never Opt in goes to MA,btohqsg
Same issue. I have emailed them. My guess is less than 500 monthly sal  no need for employee contribution,btohqsg
If no opt in then won't get employee contribution mah,btohqsg
All will go medisave if no opt in,btohqsg
Can refer to the earnings slip as refence to see whether tally if we count manually.,btohqsg
I thought you’d be the first few to realise. 😅,btohqsg
Cos I no money cash out mah so nvr go see😂😂😂,btohqsg
Most sohai job. Only beggars will take,btohqsg
Total about 70kg? Car? Their mother should’ve swallowed,btohqsg
Ya cfm some sohai go take one,btohqsg
1.7m Van also maybe wont take,btohqsg
Ur cpf will not go to ur wallet mah,btohqsg
so the withholding cpf go where?,btohqsg
just have to wait until end of month i guess,btohqsg
i only do part time otw to work and home so i don’t hit the $500 limit. most i did was $400+ only,btohqsg
so far ok la  got my cpf contribution on time. 2 whole dollars 😂,btohqsg
this will really help me with my BTO downpayment,btohqsg
This amount straight goes into MA not OA mahh?,btohqsg
Go and check again Bro. 😅,btohqsg
less than 30yo so it’s mandatory opt in,btohqsg
Old man only go MA. 😅,btohqsg
0.69$. Help you pay a bit,btohqsg
Those who opt in  got get any cpf from llm itself? Tot employer need to give also😂,btohqsg
Isn't that from the deduction from your job fare?,btohqsg
I tot employers need to contribute also,btohqsg
no la not so little  the deduction from job fare will be refunded to my wallet since i earn < $500,btohqsg
Ah. What abt other drivers who make more,btohqsg
I want see if llm will honour n contribute 😂😂,btohqsg
I nvr opt in  so I just get the amt deducted from my jobs that go into medisave,btohqsg
So if u make less than 500  the amt they deduct doesn't go to ur cpf? U get it back?,btohqsg
just like regular job outside if you earn less than $500 won't deduct  only got 17% employer contribution,btohqsg
in 2029 then will be 20% deduction and 17% employer side,btohqsg
U better double check with llm. Maybe u email them better if u don't want go the ofc check,btohqsg
wait until end of month see how since they say last working day then will receive,btohqsg
Is LLM CPF contribution under the name EASYVAN?,btohqsg
I tot LLM will contribute to OA also  no ah?,btohqsg
The medisave also nv give full amount,btohqsg
Good evening fellow LLM partners..may I know if delivering to Sentosa Cove condo  which lane should I go to avoid paying for entry?,btohqsg
Left 2/3 lane  show LLM order,btohqsg
Thk you very much.. really appreciate your reply bro 🙏,btohqsg
So u better inform llm faster,btohqsg
No payslip how to check sia. This Llm also cock,btohqsg
Hopefully one day they kena LTA undercover. Spoil market,btohqsg
May I ask those who take pooling jobs  if no delivery time is specified during booking  do U all inform customers in advance that the rule is pick up within 2hrs n deliver by 4hrs?,btohqsg
Under wallet earning slip. That’s LLM payslip.,btohqsg
Pls allow me to share my thoughts  and I understand some may not like hearing this. The reason there are so many pooling jobs nowadays is that  as drivers  we also need to make a living. I get it  I totally understand some of us rush to take these pooling jobs  arrive quickly  and deliver asap so we can move on to the next order. BUT this can sometimes give customers the impression that pooling jobs are no different from regular orders. Yes the price is shit. Tats why a lot of driver leave LLM platform.Unfortunately  some customers have a poor attitude. Some even put in pooling job note- demand that their food be delivered ASAP immediately  with no delays  and make remarks like  ‘If you can’t do it  don’t take it ’ because they know someone will eventually take it. Ya i understand It’s sibeh frustrating.,btohqsg
Hi need help  why am i flag violation? How do i go about this?,btohqsg
Hi fellow LLM partner  I totally agree with you.Sunday I accepted my first pooling job since I was nearby pickup place  when I arrived I saw it was sliced cream cakes  I told customer your cake can stay outside up to 4hrs? She was stunned..she said she needs it to be delivered immediately..I said sorry I can't cos it's a pooling job. She had to contact CS to adjust job to regular job instead. She probably got reprimanded by her boss cos boss called me when I was making way to recipient's place while sender was still settling with CS. Thankfully he was polite when asking about the situation so I sent him the poster..Then just now I took another pooling job n it was cups of pudding so again I checked with sender can leave out for so long  she was surprised too.. asked me if can deliver within 2hrs..I showed her the poster by right I only need to pick up in 2hrs and deliver within 4hrs..she asked me how to change to regular job 🥴 I think alot of customers probably don't know the difference..so better to either text before going to pick up or else when reach just show the poster to prevent misunderstanding.,btohqsg
Let them be . Let them spoil the market and earn peanut because this amount of money is all they can earn . I am glad I left LLM,btohqsg
Oh dear..I hope the CS can help you..doesn't seem u did anything wrong to me though,btohqsg
Ya i did nothing wrong. But do i need to email them? Revoked for nothing. Anyone experienced the same thing?,btohqsg
I saw one job earlier with multiple locations n it's exactly like what u quoted here..demanding to be delivered asap.. job only pays $30+ for 40+km,btohqsg
Click the Help button at top right of your job n live chat with them to see if they can find out the cause for the violation,btohqsg
You need to go LLM office ask them  only they can explain to you because they do things anyhow one,btohqsg
Sorry where is the LLM office?,btohqsg
Ok thank u will come down then,btohqsg
LLM manager can tell you they don't know that their system working this way,btohqsg
I am pretty sure they don’t care,btohqsg
Hi can I know where to get this pooling order poster showing the 2-4hrs delivery time so that intoo can show customer n make them understand..,btohqsg
I don’t see any payslip. It’s empty inside,btohqsg
You guys have the January payslip?,btohqsg
I got it from the LLM Sg linktree link.. u may refer to the screenshot I just sent,btohqsg
Eh how come today the app keeps popping out this menu whenever I click on Navigate sia,btohqsg
Pooling job plz don't send immediately so they won't take advantage of us by delivering asap like priority or regular jobs so they thought by pooling is much better and cheap fares 😆,btohqsg
Who will listen bro . There always a worm inside the apple,btohqsg
That's why broBut some people don't understand that's why need to explain bro 😊...some vendor don't know about pooling so I will inform them about the procedure of delivery,btohqsg
End of the day only benefit LLM and customer . The price will only get worse next time,btohqsg
Price will increase if everyone play a part by not accepting the order if the fare is low but too bad some people just grab without considering the fare after deduction 😆😂,btohqsg
If u scroll  below this website  this is for Malaysia. Previously pooling topic was discussed last mth in here so I went through the Lalamove app linktree and found that poster I shared today.,btohqsg
Can go to this from the app  click on the pooling feature n the poster is found there.,btohqsg
Sharing just to protect all fellow LLM service providers 🙏💪,btohqsg
Why m'sia is 24 hours  s'pore 4 hours? Different by 20 hours yet the price is not beneficial for drivers. LLM is cheating s'pore drivers,btohqsg
Today the price all below 15 all so far far jialat,btohqsg
I now at home   my bike wont start for under 20$ 😆,btohqsg
25km for $12 someone took it,btohqsg
No respect but not worth it 😆,btohqsg
Maybe this 12 will get him rich,btohqsg
I saw too 🥴times are hard indeed..,btohqsg
I mean you can’t wait awhile maybe they will add more to it,btohqsg
Once appear you scare some one snatch from you $12 ?,btohqsg
We all understand time are bad but use Ur common sense is it worth it after deduction 😆..some people still never learnt😂,btohqsg
Correct wait for awhile sure they increased 😊,btohqsg
I feel sad for these people,btohqsg
Ya..anyway just hope everyone finish their jobs and return home safely.. 🙏,btohqsg
True safety come first anyway work smart n be safe 🙏🏻😊,btohqsg
Please  u do llm for charity . At your own will. If u find it hard why do? Much easier jobs elsewhere like mcd   burger king. U earn more there,btohqsg
Seems like you have so much hate on LLM like I do lol,btohqsg
I don't. I only do one job a day,btohqsg
Finish work at raffles place at 6pm. Take something go home,btohqsg
That’s the way it should be,btohqsg
If u do full time only to pay petrol and parking . Just sleep at home better,btohqsg
I only do when I want to pump my petrol,btohqsg
Sometimes I take grab express if have,btohqsg
Grab express very hard leh I find . Open whole day also don’t have 1,btohqsg
One job a day for on way home. I stay Jurong,btohqsg
Just do it. But he will usually ask. If it’s not direct he will cancel.,btohqsg
Below 500 company also never contribute,btohqsg
you getting cheated by your company lol,btohqsg
U still new to cpf la,btohqsg
this is employee deduction not employer contribution,btohqsg
Why today so many $1 job,btohqsg
Currently I can see only 8 orders available,btohqsg
Yesterday fare jialat today also jialat,btohqsg
Just curious  I noticed such jobs have gone on for some time...I guess sure got ppl taking hence these jobs are still being posted..🥴,btohqsg
Yes agree 😅 be safe everyone,btohqsg
Yes order very slow and rate also,btohqsg
after some time they will adjust the pricing   won’t be just $1,btohqsg
something like that   from the same sender,btohqsg
$1 just a starting fare   afterwards will adjust to reasonable amount,btohqsg
Oh!! That's how it looks like..learnt something new today . really appreciate your explanation 🙏,btohqsg
It’s charity work like our friend say,btohqsg
Bro Have you do your charity yet for today ?,btohqsg
Today go for dinner . No charity,btohqsg
Really? No charity to do? Go eat some good food,btohqsg
Go back have dinner with family better,btohqsg
Then let them do the charity themselves,btohqsg
At least charity need some kopi money to enjoy kopi,btohqsg
That day I saw a few people waiting for leftover food at lau pat sat during lunch time ..they took them to eat,btohqsg
Yah... Now delivery personal all suffer with a lot of reduction,btohqsg
That one govt problem already.. they make citizens suffer...,btohqsg
I think Singapore really sink like titanic . I am seeing people taking left over food by others to feed themselves.,btohqsg
I felt like buy food for them. But .... Too many people paiseh,btohqsg
Work hard  make more money n the migrate liao.. future kids gonna suffer..,btohqsg
Do good no need paiseh wan..,btohqsg
Got bal 4 jobs.. all pooling job.. nobody take.. 🤣,btohqsg
They do this pooling fee job really ridiculous.,btohqsg
Those very cheap ones only foroll monks and nuns to do,btohqsg
Ps you see China monk anot,btohqsg
But I know some people took those pooling also faster send . Spoil market gao lat,btohqsg
No wonder the pooling price now even worse,btohqsg
Yes today I called one pooling job after I accepted   told customer I will only pick up within 2hrs n deliver within 4hrs   client said other drivers can do immediately  I said then she can go ahead cancel me n try her luck again. 🥴,btohqsg
She is right too . Someone will do it no matter how fk up the price is,btohqsg
knn use pooling service but ask to deliver asap.. how like tht?,btohqsg
People still do it what to do,btohqsg
Sometimes they're just work for the money.. they need income to feed family.. not everyone had enough right.. so when do pooling jobs  we can't judge them.. everyone needs to survive..,btohqsg
Totally understand that’s why the price is like this . Have to accept it,btohqsg
Can’t blame the price at all,btohqsg
Not everyone has silver spoon to feed them   Times are tough.. let's just be reasonable to one another.. as we all working to feed each other's own family..,btohqsg
Blame LLM for this stupid pooling system. But still they taking the same percentage for their platform,btohqsg
Workers suffe when they're just suck out everything from us.,btohqsg
I have nothing against the pooling amount because I don’t take it . End of the day the price is because they know even low price people will still take as you said,btohqsg
That's true.. nothing much can be done.. unless  everyone dares to boycott for few days without taking order in llm platform..,btohqsg
This will happen when LLM is gone haha,btohqsg
I mean if pooling is that bad . You can actually wait awhile don’t have to rush to take like some one will snatch that deal from you . You are the one making customer feel we are cheap,btohqsg
Maybe there's no choice for them.. so they just take the orders. As for me  as much I can avoid taking pooling service. I will avoid. Rather take up credit job than pooling..,btohqsg
I will only call to confirm. If she doesn’t ask how long it takes to deliver. I keep quiet. If she calls me to ask  while her items with me. Then I will tell them and show them the relevant screenshots of “pooling”. Only way to teach them. Let it affect my ratings  but I’ll “take one for the team”. Let them learn the hard way.,btohqsg
Yeah.. that happens to me yesterday too.. I show them screenshot.. customer just reply ok.. 🤣,btohqsg
Bo pian. What else can they do? We have their items mahh? As best they can do is complain lor? Like I give a damn. 😅,btohqsg
As long as I am compliant with LLM T&C  I am not violating anything. If anything they are violating LLM. 🤣,btohqsg
In the end of the day  we doing the right thing as implemented by llm.. so not our fault.. 😁,btohqsg
Don’t need to be scared if we’re not doing anything wrong. So long as we follow the protocols set by LLM  our arses are safe. 🤭,btohqsg
may everyone return home safely after a day of hard work 🙏😊,btohqsg
Regarding about Van job  understand that customer book a van is driver responsibility to bring up item door to door service for the base fare of $32  if there is a lot of item  may I know what u guy will do?,btohqsg
Ask them move themself. U only deliver. Else pay extra lor,btohqsg
But “deliver” means deliver to doorstep  it’s still within the job scope as a courier to deliver to doorstep no matter how many items or how heavy UNLESS the delivery exceeds the limit. Then again if exceed  you shouldn’t be delivering it in the first place. What is not part of the job scope is installation  moving the items into the house  help storing etc.,btohqsg
Yah.. this week the orders abit jialat..,btohqsg
I think haven't payday bah. So lesser purchase means lesser order. Hopefully it pick up next week,btohqsg
Neweys sharing my experience with another platform. Suspect Ah long case. But I didn't thought of anything as it was online payment. (Since Ah long typically is cash order).I arrived at sender void deck to dbl confirm unit no  tried calling sender cannot get thru. End up call recipient. Still cannot get thru. Then I realised sender and recipient same no. Msg also never reply. So I just went up and knock on sender door. He said he didn't order anything. Wife also said the same.So boh pian I cleared job. I was waiting for a call back from recipient in case I went to the wrong sender house. Until now also no call. So ya...,btohqsg
We may never know this ah long may want to pay u to just harass this people. Since some of us are already wary of cash job.,btohqsg
Actually this kind of orders are getting more. When u take up this kind of orders. Try calling the no  usually the no is not in use. Go to the help icon and go for call customer.. actual no usually will come up and it's usually starts with +60 no. So u will know it's a scam order..,btohqsg
Pooling service is within 4hrs  pick up within 2hrs.. save this guy's.,btohqsg
I just checked. It's +65. So I find it more strange now. I think the benefit of doubt I can give is  sender order wrongly. But just let it be since I'm already there. Cos I ever had such situation where I came down to sender to receive order and got a call from recipient that it was a wrong order/date/timing (miss comm between sender and recipient)  but they told me to just clear the job and take money since I'm already there,btohqsg
Basically llm orders anytg can happen😂,btohqsg
Just take it in your stride. Don't get affected by screwed up or scam orders n just move on.,btohqsg
Quote b4 u confirm the order. Noone include urself is willing to do these type of orders at the base rate. Don't do blindly.,btohqsg
Real monks not rich   rich ones are corrupted monks,btohqsg
Can even send vulgar language by shouting at reciever,btohqsg
Sorry actually for pooling time for picking up what ah.? Not the normal 20 mins right,btohqsg
New day new charity job guys,btohqsg
N for regular jobs  pick up is within 30min unless it's scheduled job,btohqsg
"From a consumer POV  u see the diff between Grab and LLM in terms of pooling. If u realise for Grab They did indicate send within 4 hours unlike LLM. LLM is so vague with ""a little longer""",btohqsg
As an LLM driver  it's not even our  job to go and explain to every sender the goods will be delivered only within 4 hours. The system in LLM should be amended to indicate.,btohqsg
True. And as a LLM partners we should know the T&C not just do without knowing it.,btohqsg
"Ya. As a consumer  obviously the ""save costs"" word entice them. If u see how grab worded it  they just put the 4 hours delivery but of course in between the lines  the cost is cheaper since delivery take longer.",btohqsg
Cheap until….should ask them can their cake wait,btohqsg
All prices i saw is charity.. already offline😅,btohqsg
Now we know.. No wonder customers choose that,btohqsg
Am boycotting all this nonsense  jobs myself. See who desperate take. Take Liao less cost still got earn meh..have count the time spent,btohqsg
LLM can't even cover 1Km to a dollar.,btohqsg
Yup2.. end of the day  might as well u work fulltime cleaner. U can earn better.,btohqsg
I think those LJ fees taken by CHK!,btohqsg
Oh  so this pick up point is cake? I see their jobs quite often but I usually not in that area so not sure what's to be delivered,btohqsg
U should see the ones from Mandai Estate or West Coast area where they send cakes direct from factory. I dunno how on earth the cakes can sustain or even stack cos they send out in bulk orders like close to 10 areas. Anything happen  becomes driver fault (cake melt),btohqsg
Mandai  senoko  woodlands….usually those central kitchen or caterers,btohqsg
If cluster closely still can do or else add all the time n petrol spent  not worth,btohqsg
So many pooling order on friday  how to do it sia ?,btohqsg
Per hour only earn ard RM 6.50 hahahhaa... same thing to LLM SG.. which is petrol more expensive  traffic bad  if bad luck got ERP  carpark charges dont forget  customer stated wrong address or customer taking their own sweet time.. hahhaha...,btohqsg
"Best is they take ""pooling"" since LLM worded it as ""takes a little longer"".Send 10 areas will take a little longer mah 😂😂😂 so that's how maybe consumers sees it",btohqsg
Got free meal somemore.. yet ppl took cheap price and mention need to put food in the table.. i dont get it... so many jobs out there when u can actually earn more...,btohqsg
U kena HDB still ok. U kena condo. Wah piang  intercom cannot get thru 1 thing  basement no reception another thing. Security dun let u go in another thing. Waste time,btohqsg
google’s ai is notoriously inaccurate  look at the indeed link below that it took from,btohqsg
$6 and $14 very big difference,btohqsg
2021 my niece work mcd part time per hour $8. Still way better,btohqsg
Now 2025 maybe increased $1 to $9. Way better right end of the day only deduct your bus mrt fare.,btohqsg
My point is  if really prices is low why took it.. we must have a standard cost of delivery to make it balance our cost of living. But if really need money so bad to support family and things that need to pay.. alot more work out there that can help out,btohqsg
Do the maths. After petrol n parking  left how much. For platform  they still earn their comm  whoever take suck thumb earn few $$.,btohqsg
Like just now the bt batok job  if go up come down usually empty car  the petrol also cost,btohqsg
Customer see this they would think only the matching will take some time  but they didn’t say that the delivery will take some time..so it’s really LLM’s and their bad interface/payments,btohqsg
I am nearby but I also won’t take,btohqsg
Take Liao is spoil mkt for ownself n others.,btohqsg
Only when they realize nobody take the crap prices in pooling  then they LL post regular job,btohqsg
Take pooling order and let them call u or call them when u are ready to collect. Tell them u will be there in 2hours.😂😂😂Can anot?,btohqsg
"I did that yesterday.... hahahhaha.. they called me  ask where am i... hahhhaa... i let them know collection within 2hrs and will deliver within 4hours.. cause of ""you"" book pooling. Hahaha... they cancel.. lol... so they waste their own time... not our problem.",btohqsg
"Ya anyway i was at home yesterday watching tv so i got no loss.. hahhaha.. funny part  when they asked me ""where are you"" my answer make them more angrier... ""im at home watching tv"". Hahahahahahahhaa😂😂😂😂",btohqsg
Today so sian.. I stay home n sleep...🤣🤣,btohqsg
Ridiculous prices since morning... More pooling service in the app...,btohqsg
May I trouble u to tap the info option n see what it says? Just curious 🤪,btohqsg
Good weather to sleep in. 😅 don’t need to bother looking when no rain. If got rain  all prices not bad. I didn’t say good.,btohqsg
"This is the pooling info. There is a ""discount"" column",btohqsg
This is the regular price info. No discount,btohqsg
For those relying on delivery jobs  best do private or do 2 platforms in between. As for me  I wait for the other platform to assign me  after I collect  I go LLM and search for 1 order along the way  since the other platform has 90 mins buffer for me to send. But not everytime I lucky get order along the way.Dun say I spoil market lah. Haha 🤣 Even private hire also rely on a few platforms every now and then.,btohqsg
Petrol not cheap hor. (Unless u go JB to fuel up) So must find ways to cover.,btohqsg
Which other platform do u suggest? Genuine qns,btohqsg
Why nowadays there's this user to lalamove  also deduct from the money?!,btohqsg
Last time only commission n GST,btohqsg

Rly retarded hahaha deduct everyth for nothing,btohqsg
Ended up the deducting is on drivers earnings since straight -$0.50 frm us ? LOL or they add onto total cost previously so customer endure not us?,btohqsg
Don't see any difference in safety or well being to us🤷‍♂😂,btohqsg
Ya exactly lol  upgrade our insurance meh LOL,btohqsg
Make it more exp on customer end up we don't earn more anyws,btohqsg
Dunno if they got add onto total cost,btohqsg

Think btr ride in to those federation or mom etc on it,btohqsg
Actly should host one  large scale llm strike,btohqsg
Coordinated all don't do llm for one week,btohqsg
Try and let them hve impact hear from those doing llm LOL,btohqsg
Since it's not illegal to not do llm,btohqsg
Cos many pple will still do for money  even small money also will pple do,btohqsg
But rly need all llm user to knw  not all hve teleg,btohqsg
Last time malaysia llm supposedly got hold one strike,btohqsg
Cos not many do it even though b4 the date say until so garanf,btohqsg
Then everyone stop doing delivery for LLM for few days.. see wat happen..,btohqsg
Can't get the news to all llm drivers,btohqsg
To do it at the same time,btohqsg
I'm sure most alright with it but not everyone on teleg,btohqsg
Impossible for all of them to go ahd with not doing,btohqsg
They will think  or u don't do? Then I got more to do,btohqsg
Not sure how else other than telegram,btohqsg

Cover your car rental you mean,btohqsg
Using personal car also earn peanut . You think about it,btohqsg
haha  sound like the earning is not that great. shariot is having promo to rent a N van 12hrs for ard $70 so i tot of giving it a try and see how is the earninh,btohqsg
You can always try . But the effort and time waste I don’t think you can earn what you want in mind . Or maybe just cover the rental for the car,btohqsg
Never try you never know . Take it as experience,btohqsg
Dunno how is van jobs n rates now,btohqsg
But if it's similar to car  then think no pt renting to do llm,btohqsg
Unless u have other platforms or jobs that require the van,btohqsg
Don’t forget Shariot  petrol is on you.,btohqsg
Agreed. Cannot depend on 1 platform. Confirm regret.,btohqsg
U be bidding for for jobs against illegal platform workers like banglahs and china people. U r doing charity while they are not. They use company vans,btohqsg
I even seen a fair tall sinkie chinese doing an mpv job with mrt,btohqsg
I asked him  where is car or van. He ran into ion mrt,btohqsg
Next time I take his photo post here can?,btohqsg

Can write in to ntuc union,btohqsg
ABT lala move fare and how user misuse the app,btohqsg
Now ntuc union cover platform user,btohqsg
If that’s true  those that have been unfairly treated by LLM should write in with all the replies and conclusion which swayed against us.,btohqsg
Any good response? Or they looking to save up ammo to question them?,btohqsg
Does anyone know does LLM use giro to credit payment to us when we withdraw?,btohqsg
If u had provided bank account then the money would be in by Wed,btohqsg
I don’t think you understand his question nor have you answered his question. 😅,btohqsg
In any way  we still need to provide bank account number to get paid am I right? 😅,btohqsg
why i'm asking is because one of Trust Bank's requirement to earn more interest is to GIRO salary... but then again  when i checked the list of banks LLM authorize  Trust Bank is not one of them. 🙈,btohqsg
This A-Hole in the group I reckon…haha,btohqsg
Now heavy rain fee still the same .. crazy,btohqsg
Don’t need to increase the price,btohqsg
😆 heavy rain still some of them taking 😂 without letting the price increase some cancel my order because I told them the pooling system protocol and then they changed to regular and increased the price fares that's more like it 😂😂,btohqsg
I hope u managed to snag the jobs after they switched to regular 🙏,btohqsg
But it's always good to be clear about expectations,btohqsg
Guys avoid CTE towards AMK major accident vehicle on fire,btohqsg
Hi guys  whoever didn't opt in the CPF thingy..have u guys gotten the amount they withhold?,btohqsg

Heard the $25 you also unable to take back right ? Or not full,btohqsg

Wah u very hiong  u want within 24hrs😂,btohqsg
😅Can't blame him bro  cos when Google for Lalamove pooling job  the Msia website pops up n indicates 24hrs..when I first saw I felt quite ridiculous so when I scrolled to bottom I realised Salah country 😅,btohqsg
Email them atinfo.sg@lalamove.comor head down to their main office at Ubi for faster response… this is the only way or else they won’t bother,btohqsg
Oh.. no live chat? Now got prob with order..,btohqsg

so i explained n even call her asker her didnt i pass u f2f i even rmb ur clothes colour n unit  and said if she wronged me i will report to the police n check condo lift cctv,btohqsg
then she kept quiet n act blur,btohqsg

i jst came back online to see lalamove this week after not using for few months  crazy rate nowadays everyone spamming pooling not more regular... even corporate and those far distances one... fkn nonsense yet there r ppl taking it rly sad n pathetic,btohqsg
guess those doing full time get forced to take,btohqsg
crazyy  cfm hes guilty conscious  tell him u will report to police to check cctv,btohqsg
but llm frk useless will try to charge riders no matter what. fkn nonsense new incentives of platform fee to improve riders safety and well being my ass LOL,btohqsg
If LLM want to cut my money even o give prove,btohqsg
I don’t see a point wasting my time and effort . Treat it as I give food for them,btohqsg
Most to most I don’t do,btohqsg
and llm always take it out on riders,btohqsg
same thats what happned to me too,btohqsg
what location was it that u send,btohqsg
i feel thr r some frequent cheapskate customer who does thi kind of nonsen,btohqsg
to scam free meals -.- dumb ppl,btohqsg
Ya and they are not the owner of the condo,btohqsg
Actually should just fail job (provided it's card payment. If cash job also useless to fail since not get paid). Typically I just fail job. Want me to return back  add in return trip.,btohqsg
Hi all  pooling is pick up in 2hrs deliver in 4hrs  then normal delivery is it pick up in 30min deliver in 2hours?,btohqsg
Pooling - pick up in 2 hours  deliver within 4 hrsRegular - pick up ASAP  deliver within  50 mins.,btohqsg
If deliver from tampines to tuas  how to 50min 😂,btohqsg
IF. However if along the way you encounter heavy traffic or jams  screenshot the GPS to cover your backside.,btohqsg
Can! Ask Lalamove’s mother to deliver!,btohqsg
too many pooling job nowadays  really nonsense,btohqsg
everyone using pooling to issue out delivery than the regular ones,btohqsg
not regular becomes like the new priority and eevrything pooling and normalised... cheapskate n low earning,btohqsg
llm shdnt even introduce this pooling delivery rly impact drivers so badly now,btohqsg
Must be they hire new staff then come out new pattern,btohqsg
Just saw 1 pooling .Jurong east to bukit batok $8.10😂,btohqsg
Ya  who know priority order need pickup and dropoff timing?,btohqsg
ya LOL some travel half of SG like 10km++ for 8 dollars sgd wthell?! and worst after commission n cpf they deduct unitl 6 bucks LOL,btohqsg
should set a limit a low order dont frkn take commission alr ma,btohqsg
and all those cheapskates customer  pm non stop to ask u whens ur eta and list out on remarks saying deliver now when its pooling lol,btohqsg
shd take those deliveries n troll them dont go but waste their time,btohqsg
Show the poster to their inbox msg let them quiet and wait  they will automatic will change to regular or priority 😂,btohqsg
Pooling Order = Pool Nia Bor!,btohqsg
Good news guy heavy rain but price doesn’t change,btohqsg
Lala no base fare hard to take de. Unless u take those 20+ above don't go see,btohqsg
25km can be 0.70cents per k,btohqsg
I only take $20+ above per drop order. If not don't see,btohqsg
Llm introduce this pooling service rly nonsense,btohqsg
Ruin all the pricing and every customer rather go for pooling then expect u to deliver asap,btohqsg
Some even Whatsapp me pester me for eta,btohqsg
But I don't bother lol and say they choose pooling so up to 4hrs,btohqsg
Rather don't go fr llm nonsense,btohqsg
True enough... just dont support LLM. But ya.. still there's ppl want to do with so less fare.. its up to them... anyway  do food delivery better.... distance not too far.. fare is ok and job will assign to u after u drop off your job.,btohqsg
LLM is not cannot do. But do selectively. They anyhow we also anyhow lo..😂,btohqsg
Hahhaa.. yes2.. i did that for so long.. but dont forget that some LLM partners also anyhow chiong.... chiongster end of the day total sum not so chiongster.. heheheh,btohqsg
Yes agree..I also selective otherwise really not worth the time n effort...I think it's a blessing most of us just do part time  its those full timers who have it most difficult so hopefully more regular jobs can come back to help everyone 🙏 everyone be safe on the roads,btohqsg
People who still do never mind. Still use continental car to do. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
I wonder ramadan rate for us driver will be like how much 😅,btohqsg
Now after less get $6 then Ramadan get? $3 after less ah 🤣,btohqsg
Bro  don't expect much from Ramadan. Maybe we can get lots of deliveries. Price wise will still remain the same,btohqsg
The more options llm giv the more problem will be. So client really dun understand ABT pooling order. They jus select the cheapest fare. This llm more and more patterns. From MPV to pooling,btohqsg
Really hard to do llm now,btohqsg
They really should jus stick to last time when the base fee + millage fee and every thing will go smoothly. Dun need to High demand or low demand,btohqsg
The sedan base fee from $15 last time to $12 is all because of the mpv service,btohqsg
And llm now is sacred they took out the extra millage fee in the booking app. As they are sacred that driver will write in to ntuc union,btohqsg
And the service quality bar be careful,btohqsg
If u are subsend from service quality bar for 3 times in a year u will be permanently banned,btohqsg
Yeah. Last time dun say doin 1.7 order you can easily see a $26 order for sedan,btohqsg
I see advance multi stop job delivery prob for Ramadan. 15 16 stops. After deduction less than $5/stop. Also gone immediately 🤦‍♂,btohqsg
And last time they giv sedan good incentive,btohqsg
Where's the SHAKE phone to screen shot function in app?,btohqsg
Oic. Thanks. It used to be irritating. Therefore I turned off.But now I want to use  I can't find 😭,btohqsg
25km after deduct $12.30 someone just took Hais,btohqsg
Ok  found another way to screen shot,btohqsg
Ok  found another way to screen shot,btohqsg
Yes esso still need the driver discount card,btohqsg
Sinopec n caltex no need justshow.app,btohqsg
sometimes show also can but depends on staff 🤣,btohqsg
Esso 20% only ah? Caltex 22% wor,btohqsg
What's the rationale behind this? Just pure harassment to the debtor?,btohqsg
Not correct by llm and other platforms too,btohqsg
They allocate 65% into medisave for all😂😂,btohqsg
Base on this. Might as well not opt. Scam,btohqsg
Check your cpf contribution allocations by easyvan,btohqsg
Cpf is the problem here. Not platforms,btohqsg
Gahmen chut pattern change allocation rates for platform workers last minute 1 Jan 25,btohqsg
According to new allocation means contribution to medisave will be 12 to 12.6%,btohqsg
Hello sifus  this still legit ? Cause I see remarks must deliverImmediatelyPooling - pick up in 2 hours  deliver within 4 hrsRegular - pick up ASAP  deliver within  50 mins.,btohqsg
If can tell  teach me how to identify pls,btohqsg
All this ah long Chao ah quah one... Trick ppl to harass for them...,btohqsg
Act tough but all chao sissies,btohqsg
Ya I m curious too..cos I always see ppl comment here about ah long jobs....I hv taken a few cash jobs but thankfully are genuine jobs.. I guess it's really at our own risk....,btohqsg
I just stick to LLM posters recommendations.. especially if it's those pooling jobs who requested for immediate delivery  just show them the poster,btohqsg
"Very hard to tell. The first sign is only communicate thru whatsapp call (typically +60). But that is if you swipe to take  then you call to see.I almost kena. From Boat Quay at 11pm. Say take documents. Makes me wonder what docs are there to take from a pub at 11pm. The number also +60. Then I asked ""Take docs at 11pm from a pub?. Are u sure??"" Then he put down the phone.Then the style they speak also very Ah Beng kind. Im not saying all Ah Beng cash order is Ah long arh 🤣🤣. But this is the tell tale signs",btohqsg
This kind dun use SG no. I think scared police will track if make report,btohqsg
See +60 xxxccccxxxxx or other then +65  straight cancel. Dun waste time,btohqsg
Now cancel also problem. Must wait for half and hour before resume order. I think best to avoid cash order.,btohqsg
Or take another order first before you cancel,btohqsg
This Ah Long really give so much problem. Not only LLM. People order from carousell also kena 😑,btohqsg
If Confirmed u want to cancel then just wait till u get new other then cancel. Let scammer wait loh. Rmbr to screenshot new order.,btohqsg
I really pity those ppl who kena scam by this Ah Long. Got 1 LLM rider kena. Instructions was to go to sender house and take all the black shoes. Once done. They block,btohqsg
And police not doing anything about it?,btohqsg
I really want to report police but someone here mentioned before police cannot do anything also,btohqsg
At most police come to the house and take statement 👮. Too many on the loose already,btohqsg
I got one legit case. Previous Tenant borrow ah long. Then Landlord of that previous Tenant sold the house. Unfortunately Tenant never change add. Ah long come and haunt the house with the new owner. Die lah like tat,btohqsg
For me  usually after 9pm. I don’t take cash orders. To avoid all this troublesome issues. Since it’s is truly very difficult to tell which is legitimate and which are scam orders. 😅,btohqsg
LLM should just follow GE  no cash payment allowed,btohqsg
What to do... LLM treat customer no 1. That's why our order now also $0.50 per 1KM 😁,btohqsg
That’s why I stick to G or Tada. But Tada not taking in any more new drivers. I only open LLM during festive periods or whole day heavy rain  just to stack. 🤭,btohqsg
Yeah gotta admit LLM rates are good during festive esp CNY. The last 2 weeks of pre CNY also I never do other platform. Only LLM 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Nxt one will prob be mothers day,btohqsg
Still a long way to go,btohqsg
Did someone do the charity ?,btohqsg
didn’t notice   but if someone dare to book like this most likely someone did charity for him before,btohqsg
I bet there will be people who accept,btohqsg
Anyone know what this surcharge is about? Didn't see it listed in the price breakdown of the job,btohqsg
Don't know la... Not listed in the order... How to tell if the surcharge goes to LLM or to drivers,btohqsg
Hi bosses  anyone used getgo for LLM jobs? Need some queries. Am new to this .. 🙏🙏,btohqsg
I really don’t advise using GetGo but may want to use Shariot instead.- GetGo don’t need to fork out money for petrol but will charge you for distance travelled.-Shariot use your own money to top up petrol however only pay for the usage of the car depending on how many hours you booked.,btohqsg
Stay home with ur family better. Dun waste ur time with LLM.,btohqsg
That’s why lor. Rather than you use car sharing  you might as well rent a car outside and do. A whole lot cheaper. Just that jobs nowadays really sucky.,btohqsg
Any lobang for can rental? 🙏,btohqsg
Bro! Remember  it’s a commitment for as long as you rent the car. 😅 You might want to ask the other old timers here how are the rates nowadays. 🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
True that. Haha totally understandable..Btw  getgo i thought got hourly rate too?,btohqsg
GetGo & Shariot are hourly based. But petrol is bourne differently. 😅,btohqsg
Rent car to do LLM is a waste of ur life.  Monetary wun make any diff but ur precious time do n a lot.,btohqsg
How to compete with worker with zero overhead. Work die u still lose out.  Try others,btohqsg
Agreed. Unless you own a car  then it’s your choice whether you wanna do or not.,btohqsg
Rather than LLM  I’d suggest you try FP or GF. 😅,btohqsg
That’s how bad LLM is right now. 🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
Pls dun rent car or van to do llm.,btohqsg
Hais.. thats sad to hear that.. as im new to all these.. haha getting some research from all the experiences from you all,btohqsg
One of the few old birds has spoken.,btohqsg
Ive been here since pre-covid. And the rates were much much better then. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
U better believe else gd luk to u with the contracts,btohqsg
Will take note. Really appreciate for sharing 🙏🙏,btohqsg
Haha any lobang not for part time? 😅,btohqsg
Try other platforms. I heard Roo  FP & GF not bad.,btohqsg
Hmm okay.. will take a look.. 🙃Thanks alot,btohqsg
We don’t want you to suffer Bro. That’s why we advise as such.,btohqsg
Haha ya  i do understand. Luckily got 3 cents of advices from you all.. else drop inside blackhole lol,btohqsg
HAHAHA! At least you bother to ask and do research. Some blind kuku straight away sign up and jump into the massive black hole. Then stuck with contracts.,btohqsg
Haha did see and hear from some.. confirm need do proper research.. 🙃 else die hard 😂,btohqsg
bad. motorcycle non peak hour 4 dollars,btohqsg
Some bugger order car delivery for this one just now. Somemore can said try fold,btohqsg
N separately for car orders  please try to avoid taking orders to or from Arab street area at least for this 1 month. I took one earlier and traffic is horrible where alot of the minor roads are close due to the bazaar. To find 1 space to park and quickly send order is tough.If its the North Bridge Road side  still not so bad.,btohqsg
LLM cheating drivers again. I thought this weekend got scheduled surcharge? How come I see all never include the surcharge? And yet drivers are still accepting the jobs? Haiz! 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
Check again. Not all orders have. Those that have don’t have base fares. 🤔,btohqsg
So it’s either have base fare + no scheduled fee or no base fare + scheduled fee. KNN!,btohqsg
ohh   those are lalamove special orders   not included,btohqsg
only normal orders and oddles have,btohqsg
If want rent car or van do llm  might as well be subcon send parcels. My opinion lah.,btohqsg
Feddup until now i nvr get,btohqsg
Hw much that earns haahah curious,btohqsg
Champion 🥴 really not shy to request..,btohqsg
Yes customer probably tried n tested..so sad to see such orders..,btohqsg
I m curious how to fit everything into one car..I hope the ceiling fans are small ones..,btohqsg
I see so many pooling jobs pickup in my area but I can't bear to accept those jobs🥴cos cannot decide what time to pick up n deliver..the pick up in 2hrs n drop off in 4hrs too deep in my head😅,btohqsg
Everyone be safe on the roads 🙏,btohqsg
More parcels more money lor. So must find good friend or boss that can offer better price or salary.,btohqsg
Which is hw much haahah on avg/hr,btohqsg
What nonsense is this   whole month earn 16XX- return back 60 cents ..do i go to their office or email them ? Anyone have any idea ?,btohqsg
Or write in to ntuc union,btohqsg
If u tally your contribution and llm app cpf contribution got a lot less,btohqsg
80% less than what stated in app,btohqsg
Don't know where the cpf goes to. Llm press wrongly the figure maybe,btohqsg
Go down office tally with them better,btohqsg
Go llm office waste time I guess,btohqsg
Taiji everywhere whose fault become air fault. 😂,btohqsg
No more grab or tada available I think,btohqsg
It’s cheaper and there will be someone picking up as usual,btohqsg
Never kena that’s why dare to take,btohqsg
I also get this 60cents cpf return wtf. Jan earned 4xxx. I before 1995 so mandatory to opt in. Emailed them but no replies wtf.,btohqsg
How to opt in or opt out ? Don't see an option for that,btohqsg
Wow hw u guys earn 4k plus a month with such shitty llm order earnings,btohqsg
Esp with those nonsense pooling orders,btohqsg
maybe they higher tier vehicles or full time llm lor,btohqsg
No la. Jan CNY a lot good price. So I just whacked everyday. Sedan not van or lorry,btohqsg
Bro we born before 1995 means we old men already   for us not mandatory   so how come they pandai pandai opt in for us ..that is the question   if my phv friend say is true he say he and some friends also kena mostly age 40 above  auto opt in .. siow,btohqsg
I think later i go ubi first make some noise then if bopien i go cpf,btohqsg
Update us here the outcome haha.,btohqsg
Which 2 🐒 go and take this. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
Haha... Mati liao.. they make LLM like grab car...🤣🤦,btohqsg
Go down to Lalamove office when you’re on the way.Demand them to trace this monkey.Tell them to be accountable to other drivers or will escalate this to the relevant authorities (LTA)!!!,btohqsg
Lta will just fine the driver 😂,btohqsg
What you expect? Caning & jail sentence?A fine & a record will deter that monkey to commit again.,btohqsg
The route so shit also take. Really rabs,btohqsg
Since fasting month  1st week always like that. 😅,btohqsg
Deduct my money over there put adjustment . Adjust simi Sai 💩,btohqsg
By Monday night your wallet should not be a negative Bro.,btohqsg
Myself. So now if I cash out all for the week  the following week I won't take cash order as a start. It's always the cash order that can make ur wallet negative without u realising,btohqsg
Yeah cash order all got platform fee,btohqsg
Funny they charge user platform fee but driver pay,btohqsg
LLM take driver comm to pay to customer making their delivery platform more attractive,btohqsg
Wtf how come gst also must deduct from driver,btohqsg
Wa the LLM really no joke raining the price never change haha,btohqsg
Aiya nothing new for this LLM. All issues also outdated one.. just dont do.. so many platform outside with better payout. Have a gd night everyone.,btohqsg
Not doing at all I just want to check if there is different haha,btohqsg
Seriously??? Pooling and driver swipe kinda quick too,btohqsg
Saw this too hahaha maybe driver stay in jurong ?🤣🤣,btohqsg
Understand the home destination part. But it just gives off the wrong ideas to consumers. Now these a-holes will spread the word….,btohqsg
Can start to look out for next week onwards for better rates coz people starting to order in to break-fast.,btohqsg
In SG started liao  Lala-ride. 🤦🏽‍♂️,btohqsg
Even so  it’s illegal. As good as SGHitch. Kena stop by TP or LTA  car can be impounded.,btohqsg
Raining period ppl like to take pooling arh. 🤣,btohqsg
Esp to CBD cos CBD got extra surcharge,btohqsg
Be careful of this order. Suspect ah long case,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA! Not so much. With the amount of drivers on the road  where got enough? 😅,btohqsg
Break fast nvr have extra better rates jobs one lah,btohqsg
Then they will understand what we went through,btohqsg
I think newbies now see these prices they think it's the norm so they take,btohqsg
Or is majority ft who r taking,btohqsg
The lady say wait till 14 this month altho suppose to get by end feb   if any issue contact live chat or email 🤣🤣🤣 i very not confident but i praying hard not to give me more problem lah,btohqsg

LOL! I see also I scared. 😅,btohqsg
Deduct already don’t know erp enough anot,btohqsg
Wah even less than $0.5 per KM,btohqsg
How do they even determine the fare,btohqsg
Those who always accept at cheap price determine the fare,btohqsg
Who took it plz admit 😆😆I saw it too but I closed my two eyes 😆😂😂,btohqsg
Give him the top driver of the month,btohqsg
Not related to LLM  anyone knows what [FF $x.xx] is on grab booking planner?,btohqsg

Delivered but no pay money how ?,btohqsg
Anyone got this order before.The client book for lalamove service to deliver durian and they also insisted to follow their SOP to take photo with timestamp and location and whatapp them individually to their mobile.The job was completed as per delivery route. However after the job is done. They deny payment till today since last night.They mentioned the durian was drop and they not willing to pay for the courier fees,btohqsg
As per lala help desk they inform that for cash order should be the client who book the service to pay and not completing the job then collect money.Lala helpdesk inform to make a police report before they can investigate.Lala help desk try to call them but the client rejected Lala call,btohqsg
Anyone did this job before? Is a close door mini mart located inside a condo at yishun,btohqsg
Don't think too much just report police and move on la  unless u really dropped the durian lol,btohqsg
Durian so many pattern.. not new issue.. good luck to the newbie doing. Never kena never learn.. so must learn hard way. Next time they will think twice b4 taking low fees job and such..,btohqsg
Can  within 2hr immediate collect within 4hr immediate 1st drop lor.,btohqsg
These pooling orders make me sleepy. Waste time  stay home relax better.,btohqsg
Dun entertain this kind. I suspect this is food for break fast for Muslim. Somemore want pooling.,btohqsg
Let those so in need have them  eventually they also toh.,btohqsg
Either u play by 4 hour or get them to change to regular.. Break fast is abt 7.15pm and most likely need to deliver by that time.,btohqsg
Durian orders  call them to confirm if they going pay first else ask them to cancel.,btohqsg
I as a Muslim am ashamed bro. Till now duwan cancel order,btohqsg
Cannot blame them  pooling does not state that the delivery is not immediate  it just says that matching takes longer.,btohqsg
Yes I accidentally drop but that does constitute they deny payment.,btohqsg
Hi I was the one who took the job but is this consider low fare?,btohqsg
To me its still low fare after deductions and total 5 drops. I dk for others. Plus if its a cash order and stated collect cash icon from sender  u should collect the payment 1st b4 proceeding for the delivery. Cheers.,btohqsg
Sorry boss I newbie sorry to affect the community,btohqsg
Must see the chat bro. Heart pain,btohqsg
If u dropped the durian  then even if u received the payment. LLM will make u cough out the compensation for the damaged goods.,btohqsg
Yes I am aware but the morale of the story they evading payment and lala helpdesk to call them but they reject lala call,btohqsg
Oh ya..u might be right..i didn't think of that..,btohqsg
I'm also a Muslim so dun worry 😁.  U try order this home based business and see how much they charge for delivery. Easy2 15 dollars or above.When consumer complain about this HBB delivery charges  they not happy and some went to the extend of viral. As much  I totally understand from these HBB that they want to save cost.But ironically when this HBB ppl call for delivery  they choose the most cheapest app. 🤣 Deliver food somemore. Delay become delivery ppl problem.Then like that we rider/driver can viral their cheapskate delivery mode anot? 💆,btohqsg
True.. this got nothing to do with religion.. its humans & everyone in singapore wants cheap.. but when comes to they go dine food outside they dont mind paying alot... just the facts. But transportation all want ls cheap...,btohqsg
this job rly need follow procedure. I do as what they say with time stamp  They Transfer My delivery fee very quickly. Any case  just follow procedures,btohqsg
Halo guys please  it's raining why I see people still taking order with low fare calm down lah let's the fare increase for awhile.. haiya,btohqsg
What to do Bro? Too many newbies on the road.,btohqsg
They mentioned they will pay me yesterday but till now not paid yet,btohqsg
Till now hevnt receive and keep prompting but no response,btohqsg
I asked for payment before but they kept insisting will pay after done and seems legitimate given they hve pop up store in a condominium,btohqsg
Becareful if anyone receive ya  it's a condo in Yishun miltonia residences  if they don't pay me I'm going head down to settle and report police on it too,btohqsg
Hope your case can be resolved soon🙏,btohqsg
