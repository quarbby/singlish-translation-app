Instarem doesn't give points for local transactions if source is a credit card.Only if you use the wallet (not a linked credit card)  you can get 4x points.,btohqsg
ah so  i will still get citi bonus points + shopback/favepay rewards? if i stack those three together?,btohqsg
Yes. Either citi points or 4% from Instarem wallet + shopback/favepay,btohqsg
YouTrip is fighting back! 🌟 FREE ATM withdrawals up to S$400/month effective 15 June 2023 🥳☯️ YouTrip ($5 Bonus)https://hmsg.link/youtrip✨ No withdrawal fees on the first S$400 every calendar month🔄 Reset on the first of each month💸 More flexibility to withdraw cash overseas without worry🤑 Withdrawals exceeding S$400 face a mere 2% fee on the extra amount withdrawn👉 Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysg👉 More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
If you are referring use case of using bank transfer to fund overseas withdrawal. For credit / debit card Topup  gd option over Revolut  which now charges fees when Topup both Mastercard and VISA.,btohqsg
I don't have to worry about being charged withdrawal fees ever,btohqsg
No? So can withdraw more than 1.5k?,btohqsg
cannot. you need to make sure average daily balance increase more than $500 if you want to unlock that bonus.,btohqsg
So is yes lah  max is 1.5k,btohqsg
to compute daily average balance  you need to sum up the end of day balance for each day of the month divide by the number of days in the month.,btohqsg
so assuming no other credit and debit in the month of June (30 days)  and your pay day is on the 25th of the month  and you withdraw your pay on the 25th of the month leaving only 500 of your pay  your end of day balance for 25th to 30th increase by 500. But if you compute daily average balance  only increase by $112.90,btohqsg
an easier way will be to deposit $500 from another source on the first day of the month and make sure no other credit and debit in the month. then withdraw your salary on the same day and withdraw whatever interest you earned on the same day too if you only want to increase by 500 exactly.if for any reason you didnt managed to withdraw your salary or interest on the same day  its not so bad  at least you are still guaranteed the 500 increase bonus increase.,btohqsg
Hello. May I check  for uob one account. The monthly salary  can I just get someone to paynow / transfer that amount? Or must I ask my work place to change my salary crediting? Cos it takes my HR probably 2 months to change this.,btohqsg
But 1st to 24th of the month still have the 500 from previous salary,btohqsg
One thing that is missing from trust and Youtrip is the abilities to do bank transfer (non swift). I using BigPay to do this. Revolut can do but fee is on the high side.,btohqsg
1. the first month you do this you won't qualify.2. assuming you don't care about first month  subsequent month works only if the previous month has less days than the current month. so if Mar has 31 days and Apr has 30 days  if you increase 500 exactly only on 25th of the month each month  Apr daily average balance increase compared to march will be less than $500,btohqsg
I try to compare. Think on par depend on which country u transfer. Big pay transfer to Malaysia bank only $1 in fee,btohqsg
one more question  can i still use an amaze card + citi rewards in overseas travel-related places such as a an overseas restaurant in that is in Tokyo hotel  for example,btohqsg
So withdraw all salary on last day of month and deposit 500 on first day of month?,btohqsg
travel-related mcc e.g. hotel excluded from 4mpd,btohqsg
oh i thought it will be considered an overseas spend bc im at there e.g. tokyo & charging on my instarem card linked with citi rewards for dining at the tokyo hotel,btohqsg
does not matter overseas or not  hotel mcc excluded on citi rewards card. Amaze does not change the MCC.,btohqsg
Guys  is ATM withdrawal using Amaze a good deal? In Thailand now and I think my THB is not enough lol..,btohqsg
Don't think amaze can withdraw cash. You have trust card  youtrip  Revolut  or wise?Note also that most Thai ATMs charge a 220 THB withdrawal fee. Exception is AEON — 150 THB withdrawal fee,btohqsg
withdraw all salary on the day the salary come in.,btohqsg
please take some time to understand the formula for daily average balance in a month and it will be easier for you to understand.,btohqsg
Lol same just received this free $50 from nowhere.. but I haven't gotten the singsaver reward yet,btohqsg

anyone know where is the best place to change Japanese Yen in SG?,btohqsg
For HSBC credit card sign up  would you all prefer to sign up directly from bank or sites like Singsaver? Assuming similar welcome gifts.Am more inclined to sign up on bank website.,btohqsg
Cannot find where is the promo for 4 inst point per dollar on the web. I dun like to earn miles. Prefer cash rebate and 4 inst point looks like a good deal.,btohqsg
i just google and find linkhttps://divedeals.sg/blog/best-credit-card-promotion-sign-up-in-singapore,btohqsg
Hi. May I check  Iras income tax monthly giro  doesn’t have uob bank. I saw only dbs/posb/ocbc.,btohqsg
Is wise revoult card better than instarem amaze ? When i check their website i see wise rates are better than instarem !,btohqsg
When travelling at Malaysia  which credit card give u the best exchange rate  Trust  YouTrip  Amaze?,btohqsg
If you use amaze wallet Instarem spread is better than Wise fees. Revolut and Instarem are very close and comparable though,btohqsg
you need to use hardcopy forms for other banks,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows for SCB cards  the 3.5% FX is included in the unposted/posted charges  or it will be charged separately? Thanks!,btohqsg

Hey guys I have a question about SBF downpayment  are there loans for it that I can take or is my only option personal loan?,btohqsg
Just curious . Can I link my you trip card to amaze . And use the amaze for foreign transaction. Would it be cheaper rate that way ?,btohqsg
regarding hsbc revolution card  for existing cardholders  if you hit the T&Cs  you'll get $30 cash from SingSaver if sign up through their SingSaver link. but if sign up direct at HSBC website  you'll get $50 cash. so why sign up via SingSaver?unless you're saying that if i sign up via SingSaver you can get both the $30 from SingSaver and $50 from HSBC?,btohqsg
don't like that leh. support honey boss.,btohqsg
i mean  im trying to understand... the logic between SingSaver (via honey boss link) and directly sign up via HSBC,btohqsg
cos one is $30 the other is $50. of cos i want $50 right? 😅,btohqsg
as in youtrip? cannot pair with Amaze,btohqsg
In Uob website create giro request to pay iras in (not the app) est 21 days to a mth. Once approved you will recv email from IRAS so make sure your email is updated. Bank will not inform you. You should see giro arrangement in bank's app under Services > Manage Giro.,btohqsg
