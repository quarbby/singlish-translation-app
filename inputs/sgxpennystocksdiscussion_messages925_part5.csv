🚀A Frosty Markets that Unnerve Participants🚀Equity markets swung between gains and losses today  with eyes set on Big Tech earnings and economic data such as the GDP.After a robust start to the week  the recovery was interrupted and hit a roadblock after Meta Platforms  the parent company of Facebook  posted robust first-quarter earnings but less-than-expected guidance  sending its shares to dive more than 15%.This should not come as a surprise given that Mark Zuckerberg mentioned after the release of the earnings that share prices may become more volatile whenever the company chooses to focus on a certain product growth. Investors are concerned that Meta is back to spending aggressively on AI and Metaverse  which are the company's money-losing businesses.With the incoming GDP report  market participants are hoping for soft data  which would allow the Fed to ease monetary policy. Yet  this could be too high a wish. Most folks on the market are expecting real GDP growth of 2.2%  which could further reflect the economy's resilience.Given the healthy immigration flow  the expansion of the labour market and thus the aggregate demand in the whole economy  the US growth trajectory could not be brighter. Hence  payroll growth of close to 300 000 per month should not be seen as a headwind surprise but rather an indication of the more robust economy and looser labour market.For that  let's embrace more volatility ahead.Cheers Jordan.🥁,btohqsg
