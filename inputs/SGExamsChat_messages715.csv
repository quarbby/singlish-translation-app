like even the physics side has 17 AUs of ICC common core,btohqsg
15 AUs if you don’t do an extra attachment,btohqsg
Thing is tho is those are common core iccs,btohqsg
So means they didn't include the attachment and internship requirements for the structure,btohqsg
The internship is under their MPEs,btohqsg
So it's 32 without ICC FCs like attachment,btohqsg
the ones listed there don’t add up to 32 tho,btohqsg
so idk where the number comes from,btohqsg
Yeah maybe 32 includes internship but they move it to MPE,btohqsg
Idk la but if its 32,btohqsg

why do you think i wore a jacket on thurs when we met,btohqsg
Not me just rotating hall shirts and spms shirts 5 days a week,btohqsg
i have a few non plain t shirts then the plain ones are just for me to slap a jacket/flannel/outer shirt over it,btohqsg
My closet rn mostly just sch shirts.,btohqsg

Yes sir Ryder sir! Reporting for duty! When shall we start our mass political reform camaraderie?,btohqsg

Extreme heat affects men’s fertility and birth outcomes  according to an NUS study.https://str.sg/jYGT,btohqsg
Btw  Are you from ITE West  Central or East?,btohqsg
so if the government wants us to have a higher birthrate they should install ac everywhere,btohqsg
I think I just jinxed myself lol,btohqsg
I was just telling my friend all interviews now are zoom,btohqsg
did you get an in person one,btohqsg
It is fun traveling to woodlands for 30min,btohqsg
Less than my traveling time lol,btohqsg
at least f2f they can't suddenly ask you come in last min,btohqsg
But I had pretty bad physical interview experiences  like in Jc I was interviewing for this scholarship  one of the interviewers literally told me ‘you looked really nervous’  but my cher liked me so close 2 eyes and I got it lmao,btohqsg
True this and I can take the train journey to perhaps calm myself down and meditate…but my stress symptoms (like GI / headache) is getting more prominent this days),btohqsg
But my nervous is very scary…like I will be shaking,btohqsg
And don’t let nervousness get to me,btohqsg
But it is visible in the eyes of the interviewers,btohqsg
And also somehow my legs will become jelly too,btohqsg
it's ok if they can tell you're nervous as long as you're able to still communicate your answers,btohqsg
But tbh most of the time  ok I think it need a skill to still talk properly when u are nervous,btohqsg
the skill is to not rush yourself to respond,btohqsg
it's ok to take a few moments to take deep breaths and clear your head,btohqsg
I think that is something I have not mastered,btohqsg
a well thought out answer after taking a bit of time is better than trying to respond within 2 seconds and being all over the place,btohqsg
U see now I hvnt set the date and I’m already having some GI stress symptoms,btohqsg
Like sometimes I try to calm myself down but it doesn’t work sia,btohqsg
And I feel I’m inconsistent  sometimes it goes ok  sometimes it goes like crap,btohqsg
when they ask smth  you gotta know what the point you're trying to make is,btohqsg
the more you just talk right  the more room you're giving yourself to fumble,btohqsg
How to cover a mind blank,btohqsg
It is farely common under nervousness the greatest enemy of all times,btohqsg
But I will try not to rush into response  maybe thinking that they are not devils,btohqsg
And I feel it is something I need to come out of the bubble,btohqsg
Else I wun survive entering the workforce,btohqsg
Start thinking of basic things like thinking how to read a ruler,btohqsg
The idea is to give your brain something to think about,btohqsg
Tbh idk if I should see a psychologist for my stress symptoms,btohqsg
Idk if it is normal and can’t be helped,btohqsg
"If let's say the interviewer ask ""What's your reason for joining"".... you think of a ruler  maths will come to mind and u have something to say",btohqsg
It's always about thinking of something small that leads to something bigger,btohqsg
I hope there is a table coz I feel having a table there calm me down for some reason,btohqsg
It depends on your company honestly  see how lucky you are,btohqsg
bc got somewhere to hide a bit,btohqsg
If it is just a chair there  bruh I was shaking like hell sia,btohqsg
I think make the interviewer scared of me,btohqsg
I've been there  that was me during oral lmfao,btohqsg
Actually speaking of which  I can just treat it like an oral exam,btohqsg
It sucks that I dun hv mental support at home,btohqsg
I just red some article and I realized thatStarting 2024  the govt is giving annual amts to parents for each child they haveI just read some article and I realized thatStarting 2024  the govt is giving annual amts to parents for each child they haveStarts at 8k for 1 child per year  I did some maths. I realized it's not a small amt and the govt is a actually starting to try,btohqsg
My dad will just push me aside then I hear him counselling my brother,btohqsg
And he justify that by saying ‘coz he is a troublemaker in school but u are well behaved’,btohqsg
end of the day important thing is to just not rush. if you have a tendency to panic then establish a protocol for how to get out of your head,btohqsg
or a protocol for how you go about each question before answering,btohqsg
for me i straight up make sure to take at least 2 secs min to not say anything and just think,btohqsg
Unless I'm missing something but this amt seems quite reasonable,btohqsg
If you look around the world  it's not a Singaporean phenomenon. You can't make excuses for something that happens almost everywhere.,btohqsg
It’s primarily happening in first world countries,btohqsg
No  it's not  it's just what you want to believe,btohqsg
Maybe I should try ng Kok song meditation,btohqsg
I don't rmb Brazil Kenya or peru being first world countries,btohqsg
Woah that’s insane. Global warming is real  kids 😂,btohqsg
Today im damn tired idk why,btohqsg
Paying 80k less in tax for 10 years sounds like a fever dream,btohqsg
Alot  but the govt is giving it to parents,btohqsg
That's sounds like a big step to me at least,btohqsg
It's tailored to 15% of the mother's income,btohqsg
Like me surviving feeling tired everyday,btohqsg
As much as I try not to think about the interview  I can’t help not feeling stressed sia,btohqsg
My face is red and hot now,btohqsg
Anyway I really want it and get this off my head  so I hope the interview goes ok,btohqsg
Wait  the old system was based on income  the new system is fixed,btohqsg
I will try to control my reflexes,btohqsg
This mean irregardless of how much money the mother earns  the mom will get 8k tax rebates every year,btohqsg
On top of the one time baby bonus  and other rebates,btohqsg
The thing right  number 1 my parents one do it  i a bit paiseh ask Amy of my friends coz it is really a crunch period coz got major exam next wed,btohqsg
The govt is confusing as fuck,btohqsg
Omg the freaking email just got be distracted for an hour lol,btohqsg
bro yk the urge when you wanna sleep during assembly but your conscience tells you against it,btohqsg
so you're like half asleep half awake,btohqsg
There was once my friend was sleeping during assembly  the year head came to our class row and ask if she was sick / feeling ok,btohqsg
Ok then explain to me  if a mother gives birth to a child after 1jan 2024  how much rebates she would have at the end of 10 yrs if her income was 2k a month,btohqsg
my friend was sleeping so hard she was shaking her head and eventually rested on another girl,btohqsg
I was weird in Jc  how many hours of sleep  I still can function in school,btohqsg
look at individual income tax rates,btohqsg
bro idk how ppl can function w like 3 hours of sleep,btohqsg
That was almost me on the train,btohqsg
at 2k a month you're only paying $80 of tax a year lol,btohqsg
and you get relieved of that amount,btohqsg
Me in Jc  don’t ask me how  but it is detrimental to my life now,btohqsg
that's why i force myself to stand,btohqsg
in order to hit 8k of tax  you need to be making >10k a month,btohqsg
I want to sleep so I aim for a seat but end up unless I’m really really tired  I can’t sleep,btohqsg
my productivity is directly proportional to the amount of caffeine i take,btohqsg
im starting to get the adult life,btohqsg
ok i take it as take home bc idw to do more math,btohqsg
i missed the times i felt happy in primary school,btohqsg
Actually how soon will interview be called…can it be like tmr,btohqsg
js sit on the train floor lah,btohqsg
still have earned income reliefstill have NS man spouse relief,btohqsg
honestly i cant give 3 fks,btohqsg
I’m trying to get my dad to fetch me to woodlands lol,btohqsg
At least I can meditate in the car while calmly sitting down,btohqsg
cuz i alr seat on the floor in sch,btohqsg
girls in shock after seeing how guys eat food immediately after pe without washing their hands,btohqsg
What you showed is the current arrangement the new arrangement will take place in 2025,btohqsg
But he can’t fetch me if it is on Wednesday  I dun think he will sacrifice his work for my sake,btohqsg
ok this one draws the line,btohqsg
yet the guys fall sick lesser than the girls,btohqsg
So how do you go to ITE east? Do you alight at Tanah Merah mrt or Simei mrt? Or do you take bus?,btohqsg
I dun give any shit about the guys in my class,btohqsg
when u dont even qualify for baby bonus,btohqsg
why do u want to know?,btohqsg
Cuz ITE east in middle of Tanah Merah and Simei,btohqsg
The article even states that higher income earning mother would get lesser tax rebates with the new system...that will never happen if the tax rebates are paired against income,btohqsg
the fk i wld tell u,btohqsg
Wait at least say if u alight at Tanah metal mrt or Simei,btohqsg
My guy you can see the school from the mrt,btohqsg
Can see it at Tanah and Simei,btohqsg
I just need for future reference,btohqsg
8k a yr for a mother earning 2k is like a present from heaven,btohqsg
Why u need to know when u are not going there,btohqsg
So I can get to school earlier,btohqsg
memelinecan ban? the guy getting creepy,btohqsg
Do you get the benefits for adopting a child?,btohqsg
ok so i did a bit of research and the tax relief is basically how much of your income is taxable,btohqsg
Even if there are benefits  foster parents are shit tbh,btohqsg
No as in people might exploit the system this way,btohqsg
Like I mean im generalizing base on what I’m reading from the news,btohqsg
BRO I’m actually from ITE east,btohqsg
I didn’t ask where they lived,btohqsg
I asked which mrt they get off at,btohqsg
Yea the article specifically states that,btohqsg
just let admin deal with him,btohqsg
Everybody in this chat lives within a 50 km radius to my house,btohqsg
ITE east got very nice Japanese restaurant btw. I always go there one,btohqsg
Who tf alights at tanah merah....,btohqsg
is sg what u expect lmao,btohqsg
but you're not just getting free money,btohqsg
this should make it v clear,btohqsg
Hey let’s sing the ITE east school song,btohqsg
Wow ok I counted it freaking too 1h for me to calm my nerves back to normal,btohqsg
Yes I'm very clear  it's cause y'all were confuse with the old system still being used now,btohqsg
I will just try to stay relax but definitely easier said than done,btohqsg
ITE east  here is where we delve on the feast. Mighty and bold we will get ourselves a hold. We don’t vape  we’re just superheroes without a cape!!!,btohqsg
no lol. your entire premise of 80k per year was completely wrong,btohqsg
I said 80k over 10 yrs,btohqsg
second paragraph here. annual income of 30k (2.5k a month) and you're saving $60 per year,btohqsg
you didn't even understand what tax relief means,btohqsg
All I know is your pay lesswr,btohqsg
actly some ppl alight at tanah merah thn they take bus,btohqsg
i only alight at tanah to go airport lol,btohqsg
Well thats a first for me  I would expect more to alight at simei,btohqsg
Cause tanah merah has that stupid concourse,btohqsg
i mean it can be anyone that's able to afford the time. doesn't necessarily have to be people you're close to,btohqsg
i don't go frm tht side anyways,btohqsg
How to navigate you tell me,btohqsg
In a couple years you got a extra train to expo and changi airport,btohqsg
if im gg after sch lah,btohqsg
Have not been there in a few yrs,btohqsg
rebates on income tax come in after taxable income,btohqsg
but if no income tax is payable  no rebates,btohqsg
Anybody here that heard back from commandos already for enlistment?,btohqsg
Oh aight sorry now I understand,btohqsg
for $2k take home  which is $2.5k salary  it's $24k annual taxable incomededuct $1k earned income reliefdeduct $750 NSman wife reliefOnly $2.25k taxable income  which incurs $45 tax,btohqsg
but if add all the other reliefs due to children  not even taxed,btohqsg
So it's a major or minor step in public planning policy?,btohqsg
However  regardless of how many reliefs  max relief is $80kWhich means the mother can earn a lot  and after CPF and SRS hit $100k taxable income  still pay $0 tax after the reliefs,btohqsg
it was there all along for the past 16 years at least since I graduated,btohqsg
The old system was based of the income of parents but now it's fixed,btohqsg
if earn $2k a month  will even qualify for workfare  and get more $$ from govt,btohqsg
So this situation is unlikely to happen,btohqsg
From 2025  I mean when the govt comes out with all these policies  there bound to be delays,btohqsg
not necessarily  it depends on age of the parents also,btohqsg
the govt probably also thinks that first-time parents are getting older  and also want to get older parents to have more kids?,btohqsg
typically income is higher for older parents,btohqsg
Like the moe tier system announced in 2021  planned for 2025 implementation but is now being implementated in 2027,btohqsg
i've been constantly tired since y3,btohqsg
but today is a new kind of tired,btohqsg
Might be some health issues  would be best if you go to a doctor to check it out,btohqsg
NDU already sent out their letters,btohqsg
was wondering if the commandos did too,btohqsg
not sure what the govt wants though on it,btohqsg
But if I’m not wrong they’ll send it out way bef enlistment to ask you to come for some test or smth,btohqsg
that one was done months ago,btohqsg
Man kids going to lose their parents earlier in life,btohqsg
👍 hope you get your problem resolved,btohqsg
if itʼs so bad until you can barely focus in class or study,btohqsg
ngl i feel like lecture pacing is too slow for bio,btohqsg
But its prob a me issue,btohqsg
Just saw Two ambulance flashing lights parked on the eunos flyover,btohqsg
If it’s been so long it’s likely chronic,btohqsg
Could possibly be something like anemia,btohqsg
idk how i coped with it for so long,btohqsg
i feel like as kuro said,btohqsg
Yeah don’t wait too long  if there is some underlying condition better get it checked up while it can be reversed,btohqsg
it could be a side effect of unhealthy lifestyles,btohqsg
Anyway just don’t delay the doc visit too long  health is wealth,btohqsg
Looks like some rose syrup or some fruit punch cocktail,btohqsg
Like I suspect I may have prediabetes or even diabetes so I just went to get a blood test recently,btohqsg
I also watching my diet more now,btohqsg
I mean do you have any symptoms?,btohqsg
Yeah I also feel tired in general,btohqsg
But I alr went for blood test during NS and they didn’t say anything,btohqsg
Meanwhile the doctor say i may hv low blood sugar,btohqsg
Family history I think also have,btohqsg
Wah the ‘soon’ is becoming forever sia,btohqsg
I think I’m higher risk than normal,btohqsg
Why your life like unraveling so much in the last 25hrs,btohqsg
Your life like very happening ah,btohqsg
I’m also kinda like this  but I’m not too sure if it’s normal or not though  I mean what do you use to compare against??,btohqsg
Ai ya  when there's bad  there will be good,btohqsg
you just haven't been here for a while,btohqsg
Things became funny after my last covid episode,btohqsg
It's the yin and yang of life,btohqsg
Just go for a blood test ah,btohqsg
If you in NS it’s free,btohqsg
Better to err on the side of caution,btohqsg
Like just go see a doctor at the polyclinic  ask them take blood pressure and say you want a blood test,btohqsg
Then you can make an appointment after the visit,btohqsg
See I'm not missing out  it was her covid episode,btohqsg
My cousin did his blood test during pes screening  somehow they did not flag his high cholesterol,btohqsg
i did blood pressure and its normal leh,btohqsg
For the NS blood test I can’t see the glucose level in NS portal though. I could only see cholesterol levels,btohqsg
i think need test ur blood,btohqsg
Plus you can get time off lol,btohqsg
If it is something that happened suddenly  then may u wanna check it out  sekali later more symptoms appear,btohqsg
Once to take the blood test and once to review the results of the test,btohqsg
Yeah same I was assuming if all is good they won’t say anything,btohqsg
Meanwhile my parents insisted i dun do health screening now coz cannot buy insurance,btohqsg
But ig it’s better to take again since it’s no cost,btohqsg
But also it’s been reported that catching Covid increases the risk of diabetes for whatever unknown reasons,btohqsg
ignorance is bliss until i faint in the middle of class,btohqsg
My lifestyle also not very healthy,btohqsg
After my 2nd one things become weird,btohqsg
Lol same but I ddidnt really wear masks back then,btohqsg
Like aft they removed the mandate,btohqsg
The virus does a lot of unknown shit to our bodies Hais,btohqsg
I think covid has led to my pysch issues,btohqsg
"Bruh I went for my cmpb checkup the saf trained nurse was like ""where are your veins""",btohqsg
It’s even worse for those with obvious long covid symptoms,btohqsg
i didn't wear mask ONCE on public transport thn i kena,btohqsg
Bro  who can't see my veins,btohqsg
thn other times i dont wear i don't kena,btohqsg
Yeah I also don’t wear unless I sick. But I’m damn pissed there’s many ppl who still cough like mad on public transport without masks,btohqsg
They might have to inject multiple times,btohqsg
Now i cant wear mask  i will get a headache after a while,btohqsg
you can always go faster yourself,btohqsg
Yep they indeed did  I have two holes,btohqsg
Dude low-key I find packing fun,btohqsg
wow... looks like you were also an ex medic...,btohqsg
you truly have experience in many things sir,btohqsg
Y'all see the two needle scars,btohqsg
i feel like doctors cannot do needle work as well as nurses because when i went to the doctor for blood test she took v long and it hurt while the nurse did it was quite fast and relatively painless,btohqsg
Nono you're right man they just can't,btohqsg
Oh yea I think I have no told you about the goondu  you know the station when they check for urine,btohqsg
I remembered coz i was working in a hospital back then  then mask compulsory  i couldnt even survive 4h  i got giddy so i went to the toilet to take off my mask to brief,btohqsg
So pee in cup  put litmus paper ...let the person see the paper right,btohqsg
ok i should tell yall my medical story,btohqsg
I went to the toilet to breathe,btohqsg
Bruh got someone took the litmus paper and put on the desk 🤣,btohqsg
Needle puncture thru vein hence blue black from skin,btohqsg
But it is no choice  else what  i faint at work,btohqsg
I don’t but I still watch a lot of basic bio related stuff,btohqsg
They temporary increase your sugar levels,btohqsg
My job need move around a lot + the staff there like to slack n push more work to me,btohqsg
Ok looks like my interview will be wed at earliest coz the person has not contacted me,btohqsg
My intern is opposite  my supervisor everything also don't want do,btohqsg
Then in the end for the first week of intern I went there to wayang,btohqsg
But underlying issue is lack of blood circulation,btohqsg
At least you are awake  better than nothing,btohqsg
I didn’t take bio even tho I thought it’s interesting,btohqsg
I just needed a breather and drink lots and lots of water,btohqsg
Like I just thought I’d do better in physics,btohqsg
Yes the person keep hitting that part of my hand for like 10mins strsight,btohqsg
Wait but in sec sch did you take triple sci,btohqsg
I dropped bio in upper sec alr,btohqsg
Same until my plane flew at 1 miles per hr,btohqsg
Should i sacrifice revisions for interview preparations,btohqsg
Next wednesday and the following friday,btohqsg
They smacked the vein before even poking,btohqsg
After poke alr  they poked again,btohqsg
i think you'll feel better having done some prep asap,btohqsg
i took bio cause of sheer interest,btohqsg
otherwise your brain is gonna be fixated on it anyway,btohqsg
Oh yea im damn distracted tbh,btohqsg
Did you learn which tube carries the food to a plant,btohqsg
might as well channel that into actually prepping,btohqsg
instead of doing nothing about it,btohqsg
This is the life of a y4 std,btohqsg
anyone watch the yt short on blood blister?,btohqsg
But i should hv spammed more applications earlier (my fault),btohqsg
No i didnt learn anything from bio,btohqsg
Bruh I watch the yt shorts on jellyfish stings,btohqsg
Omg my 2nd/3rd jab fucking pain the nurse wiggled the needle while it's still IN MY ARM,btohqsg
That fkin hand with scabs holy shit nightmare bruh,btohqsg
bro I felt the thing ass needle,btohqsg
"Hey at least you did not experience the ""no knock wonder""",btohqsg
I saw someone experience that  bro was taking off his pants to show mo...then someone just barged in 🤣,btohqsg
Bro did the fastest 180 I've ever seen,btohqsg
Oh yes you kenna the jelly thing,btohqsg
My whole chest was covered in gel,btohqsg
in 2022 my period stopped coming for a long time so i went to doctor near my family and she said its because im overweight thats why my periods stop (i was about 159cm 65kg that time so judge for urself) and then she did my bloodwork   she kept blaming me for having fat arm so she cant see my veins and cannot prick the needle  then i went home crying and my parents had to comfort me saying that the needlework is usually done by nurses so the dr had skill issue,btohqsg
The shirt I wore literally soaked it all up,btohqsg
that one fr skill issue by the doctor,btohqsg
and you don't have to be overweight or wtv for the vein to be hard to hit,btohqsg
can't revoke a license for being an asshole,btohqsg
maybe ask doc go back to medical sch,btohqsg
then the doctor told my mom i may have tumours that cause more prolactin to be released than usual,btohqsg
she asked me to go mount e for ct scan,btohqsg
This doctor trying to earn money from you isit,btohqsg
i think u btr go fine a btr doc,btohqsg
She want the commission fee la,btohqsg
"Anyway the report came out and then i gave it to the dr who said ""oh everything is fine  no tumour. just lose weight""",btohqsg
ur fam got ur own gp ornot?,btohqsg
and apparently the person couldnt see the eggs in my uterus or some shit idk,btohqsg
like those u see since u young tht kind,btohqsg
"I went to the dentist b4  had major toothache. The doctor said that I need to go to the hospital and get referral for dental work to be done. I was like ""thank you"". Had the pain meds given to me and all was good",btohqsg
so i didnt trust the doctor that much so i gave the report to my friend who was in yll (he grad alr) and then he said i dont have any major problems based off the report alone,btohqsg
A few weeks after this fiasco  i got my period,btohqsg
Ah yes my fav doctor. Doctor long,btohqsg
i like mine. but i nvr see him since 2020,btohqsg
"If you silent the ""f"" it becomes...",btohqsg
my fam gp got long history with us lmao,btohqsg
no cause i see in hospital ppl built like nikocado avocado  nurses can do needlework with no issues. i wont say im thin but idt imthat fat either and nurses have done for me (and my mom who is much heavier than me) without much issues so my dad think is the doctor cannot do needlework well then want to blame others,btohqsg
people have had issues with any needlework on me since i was a kid so,btohqsg
and my weight and size has fluctuated,btohqsg
Aint wrong but damn what a description,btohqsg
in tekong none of the medics dared to do IV for me,btohqsg

💀callista ever thought of these 3am dreams,btohqsg
When what your friend tells you become a dream and it happened to you,btohqsg
tbf it was yrs ago when we were in pri school,btohqsg
also that doc is so demeaning... im really sure you arent overweight...,btohqsg
:((( i hope you get well soon,btohqsg
I'm 171 and 47 kg I'm severly underweight,btohqsg
Miss you know I stand on the scale  I nearly tip over the scale and fell down,btohqsg
i think that weight is alright,btohqsg
youre of norm bmi  and bmi is useless  if you have large muscle mass  youre bound to be heavierim 150cm 50kg but i have both muscles and fats because i stopped going to the gym,btohqsg
Good to put on some weight  don't be like me. Freezing in every air conditioned room,btohqsg
Cause I have barely any fats to keep me warm,btohqsg
certain parts of my body that tend to be composed of fat are relatively large (not bragging btw) so could be a factor,btohqsg
bmi says otherwise but also because theyre tall hahaha,btohqsg
weight on its own only tells part of a story,btohqsg
but I don't really like want to be 45kg or anyth,btohqsg
I just dw to like feel lethargic everyday,btohqsg
regardless of weight  being more active is a good thing,btohqsg
just dont be on a weighing scale thinking weight means health,btohqsg
so decouple the idea of exercising from just trying to lose weight,btohqsg
Is it good I stand for 1hr on the bus,btohqsg
do you have any backstory as to why youʼre severly underweight  like do you have any form of eating disorder or is your appetite just near to 0,btohqsg
i heard it has other health benefits?,btohqsg
I stand from ang mo kio to eunos daily,btohqsg
i mean that's a start but it's very minimal,btohqsg
like sometimes even skinny people can have lots of health problems,btohqsg
No disorders that I know of  I love food but for a period of time was lazy to buy food. I had money for food but was just super lazy,btohqsg
Holidays I'll often sleep late  then skip pass breakfast. Eat heavy lunch and light dinner,btohqsg
The prob is  is it giving me weight,btohqsg
or maybe you have a high metabolism?,btohqsg
because being this skinny isnt exactly good for your health,btohqsg
standing expends some level of energy,btohqsg
I rmb going on a binge of fast food and oily foods  I did not even put on any weight,btohqsg
That was a good 6 months,btohqsg
well at least youre eating. i thought you have ED or something. thats good,btohqsg
yea some of my v skinny friends are like that too,btohqsg
also is having high/low metabolism a genetic trait,btohqsg
they just try to build muscle through their exercise,btohqsg
Yep my main diet was fastfood,btohqsg
If not what train for high metabolism,btohqsg
I have some muscle but not in the places you expect,btohqsg
Nice kfc is Amazing this time of year,btohqsg
but lifestyle and diseases also can affect metabolism,btohqsg
yea but try to look for some workout routines that you can try tackling,btohqsg
my friends did feel a lot better once they started,btohqsg
yea  i remember in secondary school i had a classmate who ate a lot but shes still severely underweight... like actually. shes super skinny,btohqsg
is your upper body a pole lol,btohqsg
and she said its because her parents are also that way,btohqsg
Everyone has 206 bones in their body but when this guy sees a girl he gets 207 bones.,btohqsg

Only people who can’t pass would say that,btohqsg
I used to lift heavy furniture for part-time,btohqsg
Bro how do you have a sharp jawline but can’t do 1 sit up,btohqsg
Maybe my core was fucked from that,btohqsg
Ain’t no way your that fat,btohqsg
Cuz if ur fat u can’t do sit ups,btohqsg
But he isn’t fat because his jawline is so sharp,btohqsg
Don't mind him  bros insecurity showing through,btohqsg
Bro if you can’t do sit ups it just means ur fat,btohqsg
But everything else I think I'm ok,btohqsg
