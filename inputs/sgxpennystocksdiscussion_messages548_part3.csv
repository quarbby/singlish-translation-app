Reason why not reits ?Two1. Inflation. Less shopper can afford.2. Interest rate higher. Dividend less attractive and harder for REIT to finance,btohqsg
So REIT will die unless they can pivot or are inflation immune,btohqsg

Because everyone not cooperative. Everyone waiting for BB to eat up. And than. Bb waiting for everyone to contra n sell down than they buy low. So no point asking here n there to buy up. Just let the BB eat the retailers. This is the game.,btohqsg
