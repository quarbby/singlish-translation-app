CSO as per screenshot above. How to view points statement? Tried to log in via Citibank online  stated no longer can view history.,btohqsg
Hi all  can UOB PPV UNI$ be used to offset bill payment? If yes  how many points is equivalent to offset $1?,btohqsg
Well  I have a CSO told me my transaction is eligible and that 10x was awarded but in fact was only getting 1x. So I wouldn‚Äôt believe the CSO unless I managed to confirm I have gotten the points. I used excel to track.,btohqsg
Sadly CSO aren't reliable.I got an Amazon CSO straight up lying with screenshots after checking back 1 month later another CSO flip the script and no recourse. Politely ask me to F off.,btohqsg
Hi  is EU travel approved MCC for 6mpd under UOB lady card travel catagory?,btohqsg
CSO usually based on tnc pdf to answer our question  information not up to date,btohqsg
U can jus simply search in this group... i think it will address to wat u ask,btohqsg
I think just wait for next month statement to see if citi provide the 9x. now also CSO unreliable. My last statement date was 18 JAN and i can confirm still award the 9x points. Since you guys mention it starts on 20th onwards  i guess just wait then,btohqsg
Pretty bad deal  8700 UNI$ for $100 rebate.,btohqsg
Provided you don‚Äôt via Kris+.Should be no problem.,btohqsg
Actually you dont really need to wait for the stmt to know as points are usually credited once transaction posts,btohqsg
if i recall it only show the 1x first  then the 9x show on statement date? thats what i always see,btohqsg
Citi has excluded hospital from rewards if paying directly unless you hold Ultima.,btohqsg
Lets all pray hard that its jus a technical glitch...,btohqsg
I think it all comes together? The 10x point if valid,btohqsg
yup  ThankYou points generally come together,btohqsg
Hey experts  if ure a self employed do u need to contribute to medisave monthly or can it be annually?,btohqsg
is it? im not sure then. cause i always update my spending weekly and see my points under points earn this month usually its 1x but statement 9x. maybe im wrong. for me  i think i will just wait. if really nerfed  then i will use the next best thing  hsbc rev.,btohqsg
Usually takes abt 3 working days to reflect the 9x points,btohqsg
Hopefully so. I foresee a mass exodus of citi miles chasers if they really want to scrap Amaze support,btohqsg
oh well. just wait then. unless someone has statement date soon then can verify,btohqsg
Thats about the only thing going right for them at the moment,btohqsg
HSBC's marketing team looking at CRMC's potential nerf be like:,btohqsg
Well HSBC already nerf travel. but thank god we have other cards to charge at but if not both are also useless if nerf 100%,btohqsg
But my 9x alr came for shopback but not for amaze on 21st jan ü•≤,btohqsg
Hsbc revo only nerf Airbnb/hotel right ?Still can charge flight ticket to get miles/cashback ?,btohqsg
cross check with heymax for the code,btohqsg
HSBC Revol  CRMC's direct competitor  still 4mpds a lot of merchant categories that CRMC no longer supports. Both cards are not designed for travel spend to begin with,btohqsg
"Is the ""all other offline non dining expenses"" contactless? Can consider using uob ppv. I know it's little but why not if it can pool with points from UOB ladys.What's the remaining spend of 1.5k?DBS wwmc is solid for online stuff  at least not too spread out.",btohqsg
true but its a one stop card instead of thinking what card to use.,btohqsg
End of the day  the banks are doing all these to negatively reinforce us to sign up for different cards. They DO NOT want us to adopt a one stop shop card since that's not good for their business,btohqsg
for uob ppv  can you get 4mpd for medical expenses e.g. dental clinic  GP private clinic etc.?,btohqsg
yes i used it for dental and GP before,btohqsg
Can as long as they're not in hospitals and they accept mobile contactless,btohqsg
Hey all  I bought my japan tickets and hotels through agoda using hsbc revolution. Today I saw I billed that 1% as DCC fee. I didn't realize I paying in jpy but my webpage showing sgd. How do I avoid this for future purchase?,btohqsg
Unavoidable usually if the origin of the website is based overseas (not in sg),btohqsg
I hope this was a purchase in Dec though.,btohqsg
I using hsbc revolution  under visa. I think I used paylater cause immediate payment there a extra $8.,btohqsg
Sadly I booked last week üòî mcc not in the hsbc whitelist,btohqsg
So even I use other credit card like revolut or wise  I still get that 1% DCC fee?,btohqsg
I dont recommend using paylater.For eg. you check out on 1st Jan 2024  the price reflect SGD200. If you use the paylate function  the price most probably will be more expensive than S$200 on the date you paid.& 1% fee will be charged because the paylater is in foreign currency.,btohqsg
Usually for confirmed hotel transactions  i used dbswmcc. For non-confirmed hotel transactions  I use any other bank card other than dbswmcc. DBSWMCC charge 1% DCC fee on the amount u paid and 1% fee on the refund amount. Other banks cc refund the DCC 1% charged on amount paid.,btohqsg
In general:Mastercard CC charge 1% DCC fee when check out using MC.All CC charge 1% DCC fee for paylater.DBSWMCC charge 1% fee for agoda cancellation refund.,btohqsg
The hotels were pay later but the flights is immediately. That 1% was on the flights. Hotels haven't paid yet. They will be deducted closer to the date.,btohqsg
Hmm  I use another card on my next booking.,btohqsg
But using wise or revolut I still get charged 1%? Assuming I convert to their currency and pay,btohqsg

Does anyone know if capital land voucher count for 10X for Citi rewards card? And if it does for qualifying spend for welcome rewards,btohqsg
Nope if u buy directly on app  yes if u buy on wogi,btohqsg
It's very simply. When booking on Agoda  all mastercard will get 1% DCC because payment is processed in HK. All payment with Visa won't get any DCC because payment is processed in SG.,btohqsg
