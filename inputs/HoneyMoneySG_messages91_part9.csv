Ya   GOV support the low income.Not the mid income.In this way don't need to increase personal income tax,btohqsg
This don't related to the cpf,btohqsg
If increase personal income tax   same things...they tax you and pay you CPF,btohqsg
Cpf Interest don't come from tax but thought gov investment,btohqsg
What talking you.... Please do your research before blabbering crap...,btohqsg
Interest they have to take from some where not from the sky ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Gov yearly budget for CPF interest to set a side,btohqsg
You can refer to the excerpt from the TNC here:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163442,btohqsg
This is under the situation after 2025 when no more SA acc right?my guess is that it should go to OA. Cos FRS is not mandatory. Just that upon 55 yrs old  if u have enough from SA and OA combined to hit FRS.The system will take and put into RA. But in this case whether for SA investment or OA used for housing and after sales  the amount should go to OA sunce SA no moreIf u want more cpf life payout then u do the top up from OA to RA ( its also to entice you since OA only 2.5%,btohqsg
But the CPF video also said if u still working after 55 and frs not hit  your work CPF goes to RA first before OA.,btohqsg
Sounds like a sneaky / forceful way to try to get everyone to be near FRS before u can touch your CPF.,btohqsg
Might be due to Mandatory contribution as now its still goes to SA. But since it no SA  it goes to RA (same int acc),btohqsg
Ok we can wait for more details to be announced but the CPF video shared was very clear.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I am looking to invest my spare change every end of the week and was wondering if there are any apps out there to help with that? Ideally to invest in S&P 500 if possible and that it allows fractional shares investment.I was introduced to SYFE and CMC invest  but CMC doesnâ€™t allow fractional share investing and SYFE I am using it for other purpose. Any other recommendation  please?,btohqsg
All the great minds here  is there any saving account count self transfer count salary credit beside UOB one ?,btohqsg
Dbs/posb counts for my posb cashback Salary criteria,btohqsg
Yes that is correct. Meaning to say that your original OA SA MA allotment  once the SA is closed  your originally SA allotted monies will go into RA to meet your cohort FRS (if there is a shortfall). Otherwise  it will go into your OA.,btohqsg
This one not so worrying yet.The big one which Iâ€™m sure many are waiting for confirmation is:What happens to investments bought with SA when u pass 55 years old.,btohqsg
From my understanding from theFAQ  the current allocation will still be in effect  just that it will be allocated to MA  RA  OA instead MA  SA  OA.The contributions that would be affected would be the increase of 1.5% contribution for ages 55 to 65  whereby if you haven't hit FRS in RA  the full 1.5% will be allocated to RA  but once hit FRA in RA it will be allocated to OA.,btohqsg
Same theory  once liquidated  it will go to RA if RA have not meet FRS. Will go OA if reached FRS.,btohqsg
Hi al  let's say if I have $10 spare change to invest every week. Is it advisable to use IBKR for that?,btohqsg
Heh heh. Oops sorry to stir the nestâ€¦.What if CPF life already started. Then u sell the SA investment say at 70 years old.,btohqsg
For this case  if RA has shortfall  it will top up to your cohort FRS  which will eventually increase your CPF Life payout. Any excess after FRS is met  it goes into your OA. ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
"Yes the ""shielded"" monies.. I highly doubt will be force liquidation.. but highly possibe for the liquidated monies to be credited to RA if haven't hit FRS.. but anything above FRS  whether credit RA or OA is a question mark ðŸ¤£",btohqsg
Aiyah I tot can shield against CPF life.,btohqsg
DBS Multiplier Account. Not tested but possible. But low interest rates.,btohqsg
Seems like it  to allow you to get a choice to withdraw or transfer to RA for the increased interest rates.,btohqsg
Iâ€™m just thinking if a person doesnâ€™t like CPF life. How to escape it,btohqsg
I donâ€™t like the fact that interest on CPF life earned after it starts  goes to pool instead of yourself.,btohqsg
Only way is to be born before 1958 or have less than 60k at payout start age ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Soooooooo if u shield your OA and SA when u are 64 years old. Can?,btohqsg
get a even better annuity plan?,btohqsg
You can  but eventually when it comes back in  it still goes to your RA if you have not meet the FRS  which will go into CPF LIFE still eventually.,btohqsg
Can. If you purchase own private annuity plan with cash/cpf/srs. But then the premium paid to the annuity plan won't earn interest lor. ðŸ¤£Unless the policy says it does ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
so like  its better to hit FRS asap  and enjoy a bit more of the 4% compounding when we are already racing above the FRS line  until we hit 55 and we can have â€˜moreâ€™ in OA?,btohqsg
How you shield SA when no more SA at 64,btohqsg
Hmmm so if at 54 I drain my OA and SA into investments. So that I have below $60k CPF fund.And I keep it that way even when Iâ€™m 64.I wonâ€™t have CPF life started right.Then when I sell all investments at 66 years old  I will have CPF life created??,btohqsg
I would agree with your front part. But at 55  I would withdraw all amounts above frs. 2.5% not worth to keep in cpf.,btohqsg
But for CPF investment  the 1st 20k in your OA and 1st 40k in your SA cannot be invested,btohqsg
So you will still have 60k in regardless,btohqsg
Ah I see. So there is no way to escape CPF life,btohqsg
Depends on bank interest rate at that point bah. If rates are ultra low and HYSA gives only 1%  may still make sense to keep in OA given the 2.5% floor.,btohqsg
Unless you donâ€™t work all the way till payout start age  no CPF contribution  below 60k  then you wonâ€™t have CPF Life ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Hi experts  any idea how to withdraw $10 notes from ocbc or dbs atm? Unable to change denomination,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtCPF website also provided the list of annuity plan in the market. Apparently they are confident that cpf life is the besthttps://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/infohub/educational-resources/best-annuity-plans-for-your-retirement-in-singapore,btohqsg
Yeah I donâ€™t deny CPF life is one of the best annuity schemes out there. But I generally donâ€™t like annuities,btohqsg
Normal current account will do  just have to decide n choose whether dbs multiplier or posb cashback  route,btohqsg
Work best if you have mortgage loan with dbs/posb,btohqsg
Hi All  if I use CRMC without Amaze. But pay using Kris+ will I get 10x rewards and Kris+ miles as well?,btohqsg
I chose posb cashback route  so it works for me every mth. So I suppose dbs multiplier works but right now interest is low side for multiplier,btohqsg
