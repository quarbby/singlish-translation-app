hello  any recommendations for cards that i can use to pay for travel agencies?dbs altitudeciti rewardshsbc travelone / revolutionocbc 365maybank horizonamex kfuob kf,btohqsg
My iPhone X from 2018 already dead. I went to change battery at Apple Store at Orchard  the iPhone spoilt the new battery within 6 months.,btohqsg
Uob kf if agency accepts kris+ else uob lady travel,btohqsg
Hi  i have 50k dbs point  and i'm trying to convert to kris miles points now  i'm at the dbs rewards page now  there is a form that require enter Quantity  so if i want to convert all my 50k dbs points i just key in 50k right?,btohqsg
Hagel Travel & Tours Pte. Ltd.,btohqsg
Redemption of miles is in blocks of 5000 DBS Points which will be converted to 10 000 Krisflyer miles so quantity should be 10,btohqsg
No go if using Citi rewards  UOB Kf and HSBC Revo. You only get 0.4 mpd.,btohqsg
i only have that list of cards,btohqsg
so have to use the “best”..,btohqsg
How much is the total travel package cost?,btohqsg
There's a promotion for online travel bookings now  maybe can see if you can make use of it?,btohqsg
issit the DBS one?but usually tour packages is many many ks... a bit hard to take advantage of.somewhat like wedding package.. the best solution might be to pay monthly (arrangement with travel agency) using your high mpd cards,btohqsg
OP say 4k ma  if can split into Sep and Oct settled. i'm just giving a suggestion,btohqsg
haha this one a bit last minute  so have to accept the fact that cannot fully take advantage. but better than nothing at this stage,btohqsg
DBS 5mpd no more slot. Left with $88 promo. But I think the $88 promo does not apply to Hagel travel.,btohqsg
Hi guys  I'm probably applying dbs altitude or stanchart journey cc. If I were to opt for paying the annual fee during the application promo  meaning to say I'm paying 196 for the extra miles  does the bank charge me the annual fee immediately? Or 1 year later like other cc.If they do charge me a year later  meaning the extra miles would come in a year later?Thanks!!,btohqsg
Charge AF immediately and extra miles will come soon ish  not 1 year later.,btohqsg
I see  but is that just for the first year or subsequent years also charge start of year?,btohqsg
AF always charged at the beginning of membership year. Usually bank will waive ur first year AF.,btohqsg
Ohhh  i thot was end of member year  cos my citi rewards did that.,btohqsg
As I said  bank usually waive ur first year AF.,btohqsg
Okay got it  bro. Thanks for the clarification!,btohqsg
Does anyone know the cheapest way i can convert >350k sgd to usd  preferably seamlessly from my own uob account back to my own uob fx account?,btohqsg
ask your RM to quote you a negotiated rate... although i think SGD350k might not qualify.. do try though,btohqsg
Premier accounts etc might be better spread than fintech firms is it,btohqsg
if you do have Interactive Brokers  and you are also using it for Investments already  you could:1. Send SGD350k into IB.2. FX convert the SGD into USD for USD2 fee and get Interbank Spot FX Rate3. Remit USD out from IB to your UOB account (1 free TT out per month).,btohqsg
IBKR will take a few working days to get the USD out right?,btohqsg
Premier Accounts / Banks  even Private Banks  typically FX transactions cannot win IBKR FX transactions.Fintech firms must see which one... i think can't generally... some cheap some expensive  not all can remit USD out.,btohqsg
even if you do FX Spot  it wil settle T+1IBKR also works on a 'hold funds' basis  where funds remitted in must be withheld for 3 days before it can be withdrawn  but if you have sufficient Borrowing Power inside IBKR  you can withdraw the USD at T+1,btohqsg
