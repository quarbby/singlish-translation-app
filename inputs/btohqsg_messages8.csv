U can just change ur router,btohqsg
Ok. I'm so sorry to hear that.,btohqsg
Try and look at other Telco.,btohqsg
Circles life cheaper for network only bah,btohqsg
See what they offer.So far for me I'm using myrepublic and it's pretty smooth for me so far.,btohqsg
Ya sorry I mean myrepublic üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
How much for monthly u pay?,btohqsg
49.90My mesh I bought separately.So the price don't include mesh.,btohqsg
Singtel put mesh $10/month1gbps $39.90/monthAlso $49.90,btohqsg
Maybe I try ask them can $39.90 only without mesh üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
What i would suggest is ..Since u dont need the mesh  look at plans w/o mesh.,btohqsg
I just did a simple search  MyRepublic have 41.99/mth with a TP Link router (Maybe u need).,btohqsg
Or if u feel confident with ur router  MR got 38.99 without any router.Or even better  some people rarely use the connection  u can consider 200mbps @ 27.99/mth,btohqsg
Which saves u a lot of money,btohqsg
Same I havent got sms or email too.,btohqsg
I think u select the wrong package with bundle.,btohqsg
Dun dare to try. Coz work from home lols,btohqsg
I choose the one without bundle  it's still put $49.90 . Feel cheated,btohqsg
@SebasSebSebasSebthanks for the help. If not I tot every household must have the mesh ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÖ,btohqsg
Should be able to skip bah.,btohqsg
Skip lo.. payment cart there shows $49.90 not $39.90 .,btohqsg
Haiyaaaa if hdb email say exceeded the flat supply and not successful means no chance already right?,btohqsg
Normally Within few days. All depends on slot availability for Terminal point installation and ONT installation...,btohqsg
If u got chance... They will indicate so,btohqsg
I applied for sengkang 4 room sbf,btohqsg
On to the next round I guess,btohqsg
Not a good news on my birthday üò≠üòÇ,btohqsg
Ya now waiting for august zzzzzz donate $20 already,btohqsg
Not successful. Waiting for NOV sbf liao,btohqsg
Anybody got queue number but exceeded?,btohqsg
got 108 out of 38. now hoping they wont call us down to pick :( Confirm leftovers rabak one hahah if not the one chance forfeited...,btohqsg
Haahha better not call us down,btohqsg
leftovers sure not nice one haha,btohqsg
Hot areas will be snapped up regardless of level of facing,btohqsg
Tengah is like punggol  but slightly better,btohqsg
Due to location  I think hard to convince people to take up lower floors and bad facing,btohqsg
How to see the queue number? üò¨,btohqsg
That time we can agar agar based on which unit was still available,btohqsg
But I heard that is no longer an available information.,btohqsg
Also  it doesnt forfeit my chance for first timer right?,btohqsg
When no more units left  they will inform you by email,btohqsg
You didn't have a chance to select,btohqsg
38? 4 room or 5 room?,btohqsg
4room. 38 is the units available,btohqsg
Never receive any sms or email for the results,btohqsg
U mean current number? If you alr have appointment date  you'll be able to see the last queue number of the day by logging in to the hdb site,btohqsg
Right..need to wait my mum back. I applied for her.,btohqsg
Ohh so like ppl who exceeded the queue  cannot see what‚Äôs left to gauge our possibilities ah?,btohqsg
You mean see which units have not been selected?,btohqsg
I think once selections starts can see,btohqsg
Ohh but where to see this,btohqsg
If not have to rely on others to update,btohqsg
Probably have to wait for selection to start then can see it by logging in to hdb site,btohqsg
yeah  didn‚Äôt know it‚Äôll be that low. 5 room units left 41 only,btohqsg
5pm then receive email said unsuccessful,btohqsg
You're not. Not really. It's just the telco trying to earn money from u =x,btohqsg
Sianz. Just checked email too and it says unsuccessful.,btohqsg
Just wondering anyone managed to get a number from the May sbf?,btohqsg
got number but i think no chance haha,btohqsg
Every unsuccessful sbf  every next sbf gonna increase more $$ üò≠,btohqsg
Neh mind  try for kovan and happy birthday!,btohqsg
hi how to view the sbf units,btohqsg
i cant find the link to view the units,btohqsg
Don't have pasir gudang pollution problem.,btohqsg
Both are out of the way  but I rather tengah,btohqsg
Didnt know will unsuccessful de . I thought everyone will get a number ü§®,btohqsg
Also unsuccessful for me! First timer,btohqsg
Get used to it ba  most will be unsuccessful,btohqsg
hmmm cant see the flats details,btohqsg
this link only have for nov 2020,btohqsg
In what cases will be unsuccessful? Number too big? Not eligible ?,btohqsg
Sg is small  doesn't matter where,btohqsg
Punggol nearer airportTengah nearer 2nd link,btohqsg
Ya. Your number is way out of range. E.g. 300 for 99units.,btohqsg
Woah. The air quality looks no good,btohqsg
But... To each his own la. Punggol recreation is up there de. Pun not intended.,btohqsg
Residents as far as the central complain about the air too,btohqsg
Clementi need to set up smoking booth.,btohqsg
Sorry to hear about the unsuccessful attempt. There's always a better next round. Good luck!,btohqsg
No matter how one angles it  every estate can be described until like Gold or like Shit LOL,btohqsg
We are Singapore... anywhere is great!,btohqsg
Anyways.... The air problem was shared to me by an army friend who is living there.,btohqsg
how bad is it? can smell daily? lead to any airway discomfort?,btohqsg
But he say he also no choice... He picked punggol for a better chance at having a roof. I agreed with him.,btohqsg
Never really go and ask  ps,btohqsg
I have weak airways  if really liddat then I will cross Punggol out from option liao le.,btohqsg
Hmmm  depends on whether u can wait for somewhere else anot lor,btohqsg
No la. I'm not saying punggol isn't good. But just sharing something my own friend told me.,btohqsg
rather than shorten your life by xx years...,btohqsg
Pollution is not a jk matter ....,btohqsg
Tengah can smell chocolate not? i like,btohqsg
If i have to pick punggol or resale  I go resale.,btohqsg
Anyways now HDB bto also have to wait 7 8years to build.,btohqsg
Haha no no i was from nov sbf ! Im just curious cause i didnt know got such thinf,btohqsg
Yes please regardless how nice is the water,btohqsg
I'm staying in punggol but never smelt anything funny,btohqsg
In 2008  I saw the chimney at gudang was burning with fire out of it from my service yard,btohqsg
My colleague was so happy to pick 26th floor at northshore of BTO 2017,btohqsg
She wasn't aware of the industrial estates of the opposite then  even now.... I think she don't really bother since she likes the sea so much,btohqsg
Thanks xw for sharing your personal insights. Ya better to play safe if got health issues...,btohqsg
Seriously it's a pity that the industrial estates are there  should be longer than punggol Town,btohqsg
Otherwise it'd be a perfect place to retire,btohqsg
Thx for suggestion  honestly didn't think of it,btohqsg
Hi guys   I'm new here!  Would like to know what are the necessary details I need to prepare when applying for bto apart from HLE when applying online?,btohqsg
Anyone know of any good agent to buy a hdb flat at Punggol northshore water front?,btohqsg
I was not notice back in 2017 of bto of this waterfront puggol & only now than I know. Wan to buy resale flat at that area,btohqsg
Need to wait 5 years to reach MOP,btohqsg
You can try SBF next time if have,btohqsg
just 3 months pay before application first,btohqsg
HLE see when results out first hahahah,btohqsg
My friend got key already for the waterfront flat,btohqsg
Top - once this is issued  the building can be populated. We use this term to mark the date where the building is open for use/residence,btohqsg
Mop - 5 years of residence in the unit before u can sell or rent out in fulll,btohqsg
So nobody can sell the flat now,btohqsg
U really wanna stay in a waterfront unit ah haha,btohqsg
Yeaa. Dying to stay. Lol .,btohqsg
Â©ÜÂ©Ü try SBF in 5 months,btohqsg
How to know SBF in 5 month?,btohqsg
SBF and BTO are normally launched together in May and November,btohqsg
But this Punggol northshore waterfront SBF is in coming Nov ?,btohqsg
But why do you die die want punggol,btohqsg
Aww i just want waterfront hdb,btohqsg
Either Punggol or Pasir ris will be ok,btohqsg
Yea. But die to get seafront. üòÅüòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
My friend just move in the house of seafront,btohqsg
Than i start crazy about this HDB seafront,btohqsg
But you're aware of the polluted air opposite right,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt afford to buy Condominium,btohqsg
As long as seafront can already üòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
Lol after i die may be,btohqsg
But Seaview HDB houses cost more than normal ones,btohqsg
Never imagine hdb at seafront ..,btohqsg
Got what  marine parade was the pioneer for seafront public housing,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs will be very expensive,btohqsg
I only can afford normal hdb 4rm,btohqsg
I'm surprised since you like seaview,btohqsg
If high fl too far with ground,btohqsg
I like near to the ground feel more natural,btohqsg
Just wait lor  I am sure there are plots leftover near the sea at punggol,btohqsg
High fl feel like high tech,btohqsg
High floor can see till pulau ubin,btohqsg
I like Pasir ris more but no hdb seafront in Pasir Ris,btohqsg
Still have plots but you just wait lor  maybe wait till 20 years then shift in if there's no SBF available or you don't have good number,btohqsg
Y pasir ris? U take forever to get home from any part in singapore,btohqsg
How often u go to airport üòÇ,btohqsg
Got consider marsiling grove? overlook first link at mid to high floors,btohqsg
More often than going to tuas üòÇ,btohqsg
Po Pojust converted to citizen ah,btohqsg
My current house bought in 2008,btohqsg
melody spring @ yishun also can see malaysia,btohqsg
I only want east side of SG üòÅ,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think SBF have seafront,btohqsg
Ppl left over is definitely not nice one,btohqsg
idk when  but the area north of current punggol BTO still empty.,btohqsg
Yea. I register yesterday at HDB already. Bto & SBF,btohqsg
This plot is vacant now  not sure is it for BTO  anyway good seaview of 1.8km away,btohqsg
The Tampines BTO in Aug... not seaview but bedok reservoir view  close enough? üòÇ,btohqsg
last time only la  now different alrdy  but better not go too much into details haha touchwood,btohqsg
Yea i saw it . Not interest,btohqsg
Cheap resale at this old block  1.5km away to Seaview  can see from the bedroom and kitchen,btohqsg
How far away the sea from your house?,btohqsg
I mean your ideal distance to the sea from your future house,btohqsg
Such determination. Kena poisoned by your friend gaogao  haha..Ask your friend to sell you as resale when it MOPs,btohqsg
Aww very near like just waterfront I & waterfront II,btohqsg
Does the calculation of monthly gross income for EHG include bonuses? Not to confuse w HLE,btohqsg
From HDB:The EHG amount is based on the average gross monthly household income assessed over for the months worked during the assessment period  i.e. a 12-month period prior^ to the date of your flat application,btohqsg
so it is like base salary + any bonuses ?,btohqsg
From MOM:Gross monthly income from work refers to income earned from employment. For employees  it refers to the gross monthly wages or salaries before deduction of employee CPF contributions and personal income tax. It comprises basic wages  overtime pay  commissions  tips  other allowances and one-twelfth of annual bonuses.,btohqsg
Okay I remove my own words  so both statement copy paste from .gov.sg =),btohqsg
Hmmm  really MUST seafront  MUST east side  MUST affordable  MUST ready to move in  seems like only option is P. Ubin.,btohqsg
Changi Village also got some rare HDB.,btohqsg
But if MUST NEW or relatively NEW oso  then bo liao.,btohqsg
talking about this  I think it‚Äôs a wasted opportunity for the upcoming Cross Island Line not to pass through Changi Village. could be complications underground in that area but oh well,btohqsg
its really really rustic  i love the area,btohqsg
I'm also eastie.... but if forced i dont mind living anywhere in SG   woodlands  Tengah  Yishun all ok for me,btohqsg
It's easy to get anywhere in SG afterall  besides if WFH becomes default most of the time living anywhere is the same in sg.,btohqsg

Got chance  people selling. And pricing still reasonable.,btohqsg
Can anyone who waiting for Tengah share the expected TOP? Is it gonna be 2026 or 2027 ish?,btohqsg
If I'm targeting 2024 for SBF TOP around then  do I look at the2018/2019projects? Or even earlier/later?,btohqsg
HDB resale prices rise 5.9% in first half of 2021  with new high expected in second half of yearContinued delays to BTO projects and demand for resale flats in attractive locations are behind the increase  say analysts.üè†https://tdy.sg/3jx54MQ@todayonlinesg,btohqsg
Got ah  thought you were asking about the progress of pine vista some months back,btohqsg
@xw Pine Vista is my parents',btohqsg
Both still waiting.... neck v long,btohqsg
I def cant afford anything within 4km whether BTO or resale.,btohqsg
Oh then yourself never applied at all?,btohqsg
Still serving MOP in current old resale.,btohqsg
One would be staying at resale for at least 10 years,btohqsg
Resale got shelf life de. Once exceed certain age no market value liao. Stuck 4eva.,btohqsg
5th year to apply for BTO and boh bao to get number within supplies,btohqsg
Yes.... unless SBF lousy leftover units.,btohqsg
Oh sounds like your resale has at most 50 years of lease left,btohqsg
I love low floor  no problem.,btohqsg
It's a problem many are having,btohqsg
I once saw a cat climbing at the ledge of a balcony on the 6-8th floor  heng it never fell,btohqsg
Also lived on high floor most of my childhood ,btohqsg
Plus had enough of lift breakdowns,btohqsg
But why bought resale in the first place,btohqsg
Since you already knew that the lease is decaying,btohqsg
simi Ooo? upgrade then Ooo right?,btohqsg
Ooo is my way of saying ok,btohqsg
people like to see and listen to upgrade stories,btohqsg
condo to resale to bto = loser to most people,btohqsg
I even convinced my mum to downgrade since I'm her only child,btohqsg
always see those 'success' stories on youtube ads,btohqsg
must be reflecting what the market wants right?,btohqsg
else why they spend the money to produce such ads,btohqsg
My mum stays at a 4r and she bought this as she was afraid I can't afford HDB housing in the future  back to 20 years ago,btohqsg
"""own multiple properties""""upgrade from 1 hdb to 2 condos""etc",btohqsg
Fast forward  the two women in my life can't get along so I have decided to ballot for my own nest,btohqsg
And initially always had the thought that I do not have to worry about housing since the 4r would belong to me after my mum is gone someday,btohqsg
I believe nothing is forever  so best to take care of own interest first then talk about partner or others,btohqsg
I got nothing to inherit. And I oso told my parents clearly I don't want a single cent,btohqsg
But one day I thought  what happened after we have shifted out  can my mum tidy the whole house by herself,btohqsg
Old 4R can be quite big to maintain  true/,btohqsg
I don't want to chiong down to punggol from dakota should things go wrong to her,btohqsg
So I thought of the idea on downsizing to 2r Flexi  she initially did not like the small size but changed her opinion and even looked up for 2r on YouTube,btohqsg
So I told her once you downgraded to 2r  you'd have enough money to last for 30 years instead of relying on monthly rental (she wanted to rent out my bedroom once I shifted out),btohqsg
A good move  thanks for sharing xw,btohqsg
I also don't want her to stay with 2 strangers (current tenant has been staying with us for 5+ years) and risk of anything might happen  like don't want to pay rental  conflict and such since my mum likes to keep things tidy and clean,btohqsg
Always better to have own space and have to put up with tenant or helper unnecessarily.,btohqsg
Have low commitment  lots of time to keep healthy and eat well.,btohqsg
Live healthily to ripe old age.,btohqsg
So I am happy she has chosen her unit one storey below mine at dakota,btohqsg
It is as good as MGPS,btohqsg
For me that will be too near for comfort HAHHA,btohqsg
Haha my wife told me not to give my mum our house keys...,btohqsg
So you and mum will be my parents new neighbours??,btohqsg
Nope we are at dakota breeze,btohqsg
how many more yrs to TOP,btohqsg
My mum don't like pine vista as it is quite far to MRT and no scenery for her too,btohqsg
Haha dB and pv launched at the same time together leh though the former is a much bigger project,btohqsg
The joke for my parents is they chose thinking can clear the next block,btohqsg
I didn't even know they bought that project,btohqsg
When I checked earlier this year  turns out it facing right into the next block. They thought theirs is the other side facing.,btohqsg
Clear the next block means what,btohqsg
Next block is like low storeys i think maybe 10 or 12,btohqsg
So they have chosen the wrong stack?,btohqsg
But theirs face the old airport side block,btohqsg
Ya  dunno what they were on,btohqsg
There are only 2 blocks at PV,btohqsg
My mum had the choice to select the stack facing the hawker,btohqsg
yes that stack. But it kena block,btohqsg
Yeah my mum wanted bigger 2r too but she dont want to face the old estate even though can pick 14th flr at PV,btohqsg
She felt no sense of privacy,btohqsg
Our block only type 1 of 2r which is the smaller one,btohqsg
They thought facing the north block,btohqsg
actually is the south (blue) block,btohqsg
Were you quite pissed that they bought the flat without your knowledge?,btohqsg
can enjoy the nice hawker food when visiting,btohqsg
So are they staying with you now,btohqsg
it doesnt affect me whichever choice they made,btohqsg
The only thing is my mum and I can't bear to part this 4r house  she even lost her sleep over whether to go for 2r lol,btohqsg
i dont have any problem to deal with it or need to offload after they gone,btohqsg
4rm in the past if layout lousy or odd shape  not really a loss,btohqsg
Location more important i feel esp for senior folks,btohqsg
Yeah I thought I can inherit my mum's 4r till I needed to spare a thought for her and since then  decided to be on my own,btohqsg
Well I would say its a great end result...,btohqsg
No matter to CBD  airport  whatever,btohqsg
Walk to her house from mine takes just a minute,btohqsg
so means need to sell in 6mths once take keys?,btohqsg
Yes in punggol  told my mum to sell only when she has gotten her keys,btohqsg
Since there's a 6 months grace period after keys collection,btohqsg
NO rush de i feel  punggol value can last,btohqsg
Haha dropped loh.... As compared to the high price in 2013,btohqsg
compare 2013 everything oso drop la,btohqsg
DOnt look back in anger bro,btohqsg
$550k was the peak then  now should be no problem selling it at 420k,btohqsg
loosk like u not that young too,btohqsg
Stayed at pine Close for 6 years  hougang for 21 years  punggol at 14 years,btohqsg
I was born in block 95,btohqsg
corner unit  so every time got night mare,btohqsg
OK most don't know the place I stayed,btohqsg
all only know lao fu zhi,btohqsg
Found it. Think they stack 8,btohqsg
Yeah my mum was considering the same stack on level 9,btohqsg
I owned a unit and stay here (red circle),btohqsg
There used to be a long stretch of wooden made house  not sure which year did they demolished,btohqsg
wah then i dunno liao  way before i moved there,btohqsg
Used to eat at this kopi house when I was small  my mum said I managed to eat a big bowl of wanton mee and tao huey,btohqsg
Wooden house??? u got so old meh,btohqsg
Kopi house with the small circled,btohqsg
Yah wooden house  stayed between 1980 and 1986,btohqsg
the era of Geylang Lor 3 terrace,btohqsg
You didn't do the maths ah,btohqsg
Old compare to most home owners here,btohqsg
Just feel the 7 storeys old airport is sayang,btohqsg
the BTO launch there sure hit 1mil,btohqsg
If got launch  I hope to be in year 2027 wahahahaha,btohqsg
So that i can tikam again,btohqsg
maybe if BTO will overcrowd the amenities of the area,btohqsg
yes treasure and use 2 chances,btohqsg
Plus one more upon downsizing just like my mum,btohqsg
who knows by the time we oldie got more chnces,btohqsg
All 3 chances  getting brand new houses,btohqsg
just be thankful they dont extend it,btohqsg
Duxton first batch owners really tio lottery,btohqsg
Yeah my relative called my mum for advice  whether to take the 47th unit  via SBF,btohqsg
Big upgrade from 3r marsiling old house,btohqsg
She urged him to take  mai tooo liao,btohqsg
Sold his 3r at 300k and bought the duxton 4r at 600k,btohqsg
whoa  a major leap no doubt.,btohqsg
Initially whole family of 5 squeezing in one MBR with 2 other rooms rented out  total at least $2.2k rental,btohqsg
This year I think it's their first decade of staying at duxton,btohqsg
Though not pioneer batch of residents  still can huat should he decided to sell which I doubt so,btohqsg
47th 4r unit sure hit 1m,btohqsg
I don't like the kitchen as it faces inside machiam like jail as it is dark,btohqsg
im sure the layout not one of the best attributes of Duxton.,btohqsg
Honestly  for single at 5% chance for SBF  can consider super lucky then can get right,btohqsg
Does anyone in here gotten SBF as a single?,btohqsg
But she was using MCPS too,btohqsg
Not sure if i wanna bother about SBF as a single,btohqsg
However I had a colleague  in her 30s  single and never married  managed to get Punggol SBF at first try.,btohqsg
5% at non mature Estate for singles  non elderly,btohqsg
ya lor  she msut have been literally struck lottery,btohqsg
How many years more to MOP for you?,btohqsg
in a way happy that resale price going up,btohqsg
hiWhow many tries may I know?,btohqsg
Looks like 5% is more than meets the eye.,btohqsg
But i chose yishun cause the chances very high,btohqsg
102 flats avail but 200+ apply only,btohqsg
Which Yishun project  i oso want,btohqsg
Going up for now nia  happy for what since you are only midway there,btohqsg
Got it  choose the not over sub ones,btohqsg
Haha i nov sbf 2020 . Melody spring,btohqsg
Hope can keep gog up lor,btohqsg
Sell high resale and buy low BTO SBF. Best,btohqsg
Im under 35. I apply my son as occupier . BUT to hdb im still single,btohqsg
Single grants  still have to pay 15k more,btohqsg
Oh you have special circumstance. Sure get de,btohqsg
esp when concern the very young or very old.,btohqsg
My mum also have to pay 15k,btohqsg
dk got concern anot leh . Like no difference like that,btohqsg
Unless tell me don have to pay 15k more,btohqsg
LOL u dunno how many envy u,btohqsg
Got difference ah  you are under 35yo lor,btohqsg
ya many had to bite tongue until 35yo,btohqsg
Under 35yo single can't buy public housing,btohqsg
esp gen z and millenials mature fast.,btohqsg
by 35yo they will feel so lao liao,btohqsg
my era 35yo still behave like chao ginna,btohqsg
Got difference with 35 singles meh,btohqsg
many i know dun even know how to manage their own finances....,btohqsg
The thing is  are you able to breakeven from selling your lease decaying flat,btohqsg
maybe next time 30yo can buy as single le,btohqsg
I feel they should lessen the age thing,btohqsg
Ya . Easier for people who needs a house of their own,btohqsg
Younger than 35yo single can't buy public housing leh,btohqsg
those under demand or lots of leftovers  they should lower the requirement,btohqsg
in terms of age and etc,btohqsg
Ya i know i mean like for the application of flat etc,btohqsg
i was discussing this topic with friend earlier; everyone so hiong about getting BTO as prime spot  but not afraid cannot hit CPF minimum sum when 55 yo?,btohqsg
Add in 2.5 more years to MOP  then add another 5 for BTO progress  by then left 50 years of lease,btohqsg
then hustle their way to retirement lor,btohqsg
estimate CPF min sum in 2045 is 300++k sia,btohqsg
I also won't be able to hit min sum in another 14 years if my pay remains the same every year,btohqsg
thats y shorten by aiming SBF leftovers,btohqsg
then later if cannot hit the amount  either top up  or also pledge the HDB back to gov..end up nothing is ours..,btohqsg
omg back to this topic again....,btohqsg
Got ah downsize to 2r Flexi shortlease solves the problem,btohqsg
but if let say u can hit the min sum  you dont need to pledge the HDB  you still can do the lease-back thing to HDB,btohqsg
yes our G schemes already very very good to us le,btohqsg
My mum's CPF no money one,btohqsg
"but if pledge  everything goes back CPF to fill up the ""hole""",btohqsg
Lease buyback scheme is boh hua to me,btohqsg
downgrade flexi  lease buyback  pray for SERS VERS,btohqsg
i recently just got abit anxious,btohqsg
better not live too long also,btohqsg
very easy  just head out without mask,btohqsg
will have free BTO for rest of life... jail cell hahaha,btohqsg

my old estate oso got ferrari annd maserati,btohqsg
now u know the rich park their riches where,btohqsg
the real rich stay hdb and rent out all their condos,btohqsg
of coz HDB can 'dont approve' your renting out la,btohqsg
Anyway need MOP over then can buy condo,btohqsg
No such ruling. Once your MOP is over  you can do either.,btohqsg
"""If you are thinking of doing so  you must meet all of HDB's eligibility conditions such as its 5-year Minimum Occupation Period (MOP)  non-citizen quota for renting out your flat and so on. You can refer to HDB's link here:https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/renting-out-a-flat-bedroom/renting-out-your-flatDo note that owners of resale HDB flats purchased from the open market without a CPF Housing Grant and who have occupied their flats for at least 3 years are allowed to sublet their whole flat. Owners of HDB flats purchased directly from HDB or the open market with CPF Housing Grant and who have occupied their flats fr at least 5 years are allowed to sublet their whole flat.""",btohqsg
This reply from the pguru website i quoted.,btohqsg
That '3 yrs can sublet whole flat' part is NEW to me!!!!,btohqsg
Occupied for at least 3 yrs  BUT still must complete 5 yr MOP right?,btohqsg
a bit misleading they way they phrase it.,btohqsg
ish maciam no need mop5 yrs  3 yrs can sublet whole unit as long no cpf grant and bought from open mkt.,btohqsg
CitizenshipOnly Singapore Citizens are allowed to rent out the HDB flat. Singapore Permanent Resident flat owners are not allowed to do so.Minimum Occupation Period (MOP)You can¬†rent out¬†your flat after fulfilling the 5-year MOP.¬†If your flat is non-subsidised (purchased from the open market without a housing grant) and purchased before 30 August 2010  the MOP is 3 years.,btohqsg
I think this one clears doubts.,btohqsg
Just take it as 5years MOP now  because the 3 years only applies if you bought from more than ten years ago and without subsidy.,btohqsg
So mean non-citizenship owner are not allow to rent flat even after MOP?,btohqsg
I think that is quite clear,btohqsg
Don't think directly facing the sea,btohqsg
Indeed  that writer needs to lop head off,btohqsg
No sea facing  but 5min sprint to sea,btohqsg
Seen like only chance is waiting MOP those flat,btohqsg
You want seafront living  then you have to wait,btohqsg

hi sorry l  can i just consult  for the fianc√© and fianc√©e scheme  both names must be in applicant or can be 1 applicant but the other as occupier?,btohqsg
Can be 1 applicant 1 occupier,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  applicant = future BTO owner  occupier will not be considered the flat owner (all the ABSD rubbish down the road). I'm in a similar situation as well  from what I understand  grants calculation use both applicant and occupier but will only be credited to the applicant CPF (in the case of co-owner  will split 50-50).For HLE and all CPF payment  can only use the applicant/owner's income and CPF  the occupier can only support with cash and not CPF.,btohqsg
So HDB loan monthly repayment also only come from owner's CPF  the occupier cannot use his/her CPF to help.,btohqsg
Yes  unfortunately need the owner to understand that his/her CPF OA will likely be wiped out  with the option of retaining up to $20 000.,btohqsg
Grants calculation use both applicant and occupier  thought only the applicant/s,btohqsg
Both (at least for essential occupier). If you put child as additional occupier then I'm not sure,btohqsg
Basically they count based on whichever is worse for you üòÇ,btohqsg
does it matter whether you put both applicant or 1 applicant 1 occupier?,btohqsg
means if next time the occupier buy second property  no absd?,btohqsg
If occupier has never owned any property before  including the BTO  then the next property he/she buys is considered first property,btohqsg
Thank you Hao Long for clarifying! :),btohqsg
People usually do this to avoid the 12% ABSD  which is usually a condo as second property priced at least $1m. Imagine having to pay 120k extra üôÇ but this is not everyone's cup of tea.,btohqsg
Just have to hope that the rules don't change,btohqsg
If you alrdy applied BTO or sign lease  I don't think it will affect because legally the occupant does not own the flat. Some side effects include:- sole owner has the full right to sell the house.- if divorced without children  both parties must relinquish the flat bought under the married couple scheme. In this case  sole owner becomes second-timer while occupier remains first-timer (based on HDB definition).,btohqsg
Just in case if you are buying BTO again after selling your private property  there is a wait out period of 30 months,btohqsg
Have to rent a place for 2.5 years before applying for BTO,btohqsg
Then another 5 years of rental,btohqsg

@SebasSebSebasSebisit I can buy portable router insert sim only. For home wifi.,btohqsg
U need to check with the telco.From my understanding  some Telco block the use of sim card in portable router.I try before last time when they offer unlimited 3G data.My portable router doesn't work  but the data works on my phone.So double check first.,btohqsg
But generally this theory works :D,btohqsg
But bear in mind  portable router with sim signal definitely lose to standard home base router.There is a maximum number of connection also.I would say anything more than 3 people connecting to your portable router  u cannot surf anything.,btohqsg
Only I 1 person use to work from home.,btohqsg
Then should be ok. Weigh the cost lo.,btohqsg
Unlimited data usually have a cap.,btohqsg
Anything after the cap ur speed will slowwwwww like snail,btohqsg
@SebasSebSebasSebok thanks thanks considering sign 100gb sim only and get the portable router,btohqsg
Yup! Now the data quite a lot. If you use alone  very useful. But actually u don't need portable wifi. Just put it into a phone   turn on hotspot can already. I find the market for portable wifi not v good. Not many company are manufacturing. Those manufacturing are probably doing it for the sake of taking the market share. I would suggest use a mobile phone.,btohqsg
How long does it usually take for the result of the cpf housing grant.... its been already more thn 2months since i applied and selected my flat,btohqsg
Depends on individual. No estimated time to be exact. Cos if your documents provided is missing something or if HDB needed further clarification  for example they asking you what is this allowance for?  On a side note  HDB got lots of back log too.They might ask u for company letter to explain.  Cos this happen to me,btohqsg
If u really want to know when approve  only way is to call them and ask them to expedite,btohqsg
Ya can be that long too. Mine I got my result only after I called and asked them to expedite. Otherwise  I think I also waiting still,btohqsg
They will send an email to tell u its approved ? Or ?,btohqsg
That time when i select flat the hdb person told me around 1 month can know liao. If never contact us can call hdb or the person incharge stated in one of the many papers given to u during flat selection,btohqsg
Hi   when is the Aug bto application date?,btohqsg

Can still apply for BTO now?,btohqsg
You and your partner's particulars and latest basic pay for 3 months (Aug to Oct  for Nov launch),btohqsg
Apply for DIA during flat selection,btohqsg
It's July now  when did you get your HLE?,btohqsg
Take note that the option fee will form part of the down-payment  meaning you won't be getting back like previously,btohqsg
Only if his partner graduated in the last 12 months before application,btohqsg
If still studying  still eligible right,btohqsg
Means one must not be working to eligible for DIA,btohqsg
Won't be eligible as long as one person graduated more than 12 months ago,btohqsg
hi..my q number is 5x out of 24 units..got chance or not?,btohqsg

Hello! I got a inquiry  anybody knows the answer for this ?Let say during 2001 I was a PR when I bought a resale flat   but 2005 I‚Äôm a singaporean alr. So let say if I applied the bto   am I consider first time using hdb loan or second hdb loan?,btohqsg
Limited flats left for selection but hopefully I get the flat that i‚Äôm eyeing onüôèüèº Anws  which estate did u applied for?,btohqsg
This year many bto completing meh?,btohqsg
quite abit. there were many projects delayed from last year,btohqsg
Yes... During your flat selection appointment,btohqsg
Indeed  and hope it goes higher when we going to sell.,btohqsg
Who would ever want it to be low? Surely someone close either self  aged relatives  children will be the one selling and hoping to get a good price.,btohqsg
Thats y for entry into the 'game'  BTO is the answer.,btohqsg
unless u need to house family of 10,btohqsg
Until maxed out benefits  then 'downgrade',btohqsg
Sorry  'right size' is the pc term.,btohqsg
Wait serious? I select the flat in feb 2021 and till now they havent call me to sign the lease. I thought its normal,btohqsg
Ok but now i will call them then,btohqsg
They got backlog ba. Today I saw someone commented that they came back from HDB saying morning the HDB staff rushing to hand over keys for those that suppose to get their keys during covid period.,btohqsg
True just relax ah for now. House also ready 2024.,btohqsg
Don't understand why so many people want to sign the lease ASAP,btohqsg
Once you started to downpayment your house  CPF starts to compute accrued interest,btohqsg
Btw is cpf accrued interest 2.5% or 3.5% if have less than 20k in OA?,btohqsg
I'm referring to cpf accrued interest,btohqsg
I agree. More time to save,btohqsg
oh lol different sites say different thing,btohqsg
Signed the lease in March 2018 till now 39 months passed,btohqsg
if got more than 20k in OA then confirm 2.5%. If less I'm not sure,btohqsg
Not more time to save but earn more interest given by CPF,btohqsg
Which accrued interest are y'all talking about  what's left of the OA  or what's left of the loan,btohqsg
I mean  it's the same amount as the interest accrued by the CPF loan,btohqsg
This is from HLE maCurrent interest rate for an HDB concessionary housing loan. The interest rate will be based on the interest rate for CPF OrdinaryAccount plus 0.1%.3Interest rate may increase  and the monthly contributions to the CPF Ordinary Account will change over time. To minimise interest cost please minimise the loan amount and opt for a shorter repayment period  if possible.,btohqsg
Interest Rate for Ordinary AccountInterest rate from 1 July 2021 to 30 September 2021: 2.5% per annumThe interest rate is computed based on the 3-month average of major local banks' interest rates1  subject to the legislated minimum interest of 2.5% per annum. The interest rate for OA is reviewed quarterly.,btohqsg
Coz interest for OA is 3.5% for first 20k right? So technically accrued interest should follow same rate,btohqsg
Accrued interest is not loan interest,btohqsg
It's the amt you have to pay back to your cpf when you sell the hse. Doesn't matter whether its bank loan or hdb loan,btohqsg
Wait  it's not running on the same interest rate?,btohqsg
Accumulated $1841 the past 39 months,btohqsg
Nvm I guess if you intend to sell house and by another one  the accrued interest doesn't really matter ba,btohqsg
Unless you want to buy BTO again to make use of the chance,btohqsg
Ya but if you buy another house straightaway. You pay back to OA then immediately take out lor,btohqsg
Anyone can advise which course provide is the best for RES course?,btohqsg

Must meet the MOP before you can BTO,btohqsg
But no harm to try lol,btohqsg
Yah if you have valid reasons lah,btohqsg
I was like thinking since BTO take avg 4-5 years to build. By the time collect key  balance MOP already served.,btohqsg
Haha no reason. Just want to apply lor.   Anyway not for me lah,btohqsg
Yes and I have seen applicants went ahead to BTO despite their MOP is not fully met  and they still got ballot number,btohqsg
Anyway it's just $10 to try,btohqsg
