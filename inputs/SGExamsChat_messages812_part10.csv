before he goes for his masters ig,btohqsg
But yea  rlly shocked  is like the mumber of ppl doing pure is double digits,btohqsg
i know he's going Delft then it's like if he does well he can just auto continue to PhD,btohqsg
Oh ok no idea who tf,btohqsg
Who tf names their son Ashley,btohqsg
Oh hell no we are not doing that hahahaha,btohqsg
And then everything is full circle,btohqsg
tbf the difference is legit v minimal now,btohqsg
It is like 10+ / 50 students,btohqsg
i mean like the diff between pure and applied,btohqsg
Oh yea  heard they gonna change some stuff also,btohqsg
got second major in quantum tech,btohqsg
We have an edwin goh  but no,btohqsg
Got  just introduced like this year,btohqsg
Bruh how many Edwins yall have,btohqsg
i might audit some of the new mods that start from that second major,btohqsg
I met one of em I think,btohqsg
spms profs are really chill about auditing,btohqsg
Yall week 1-2 I come and fuck things up for yall,btohqsg
Enter lecture with a typewriter for notes,btohqsg
Auditing is basically just sitting in for the mod,btohqsg
And that word reminds me of when I read chanric's linkedin and he listed all the courses he audited for and i was wondering what's the use of that and where's the credibility lmao,btohqsg
For all you know i can claim i audited graduate quantum mechanics too,btohqsg
iestin rhyme with einstein for sure,btohqsg
"""Tbh I can write a letter to show you came for my lectures""",btohqsg
So all i need to do is sit in for graduate quantum mechanics lectures and i can get a letter too?,btohqsg
No exam no finals i just sit in only,btohqsg
One of the profs actually said that,btohqsg
even so  it's kinda useless lol,btohqsg
i audited prof weber's nanoscale physics a while back then just asked him whether he could give me access to the notes,btohqsg
Where would i find it LOL,btohqsg
Yes bc he is an athlete,btohqsg
I hv a treadmill at homeðŸ’€,btohqsg
Ah. Yes I know him because he's a.. colorful character lmao,btohqsg
You literally just ask the prof for the course materials,btohqsg
You are not enrolled or graded in anyways and it does not reflect on your transcript but u attend the lectures and read the materials,btohqsg
Most Profs will. Depends on Prof but they usually will just give it to you,btohqsg
Because there is a chicken rice stall nearby at the embassy,btohqsg
So it is a shun bian thing after voting,btohqsg
Which GRC are u legally registered to tho,btohqsg
Are you a hammer or lightning fan?,btohqsg
I hear hammer might contest Tampines,btohqsg
Vote Thor. Thor has both thunder(lightning) and hammer.,btohqsg
Then will it be a 3 way contestðŸ’€ðŸ’€GE2020 is which opposition?,btohqsg
This time maybe hammer might be on your ballot,btohqsg
Actually I saw his interview before,btohqsg
And I feel that he seems like down to earth type of guy,btohqsg
But I think the picture of him is negative because of the boo thing,btohqsg
But making a 3 way fight aint a wise choice for the opposition to make,btohqsg
If the hammer contest usually it will mean the other oppo will lose their deposit,btohqsg
