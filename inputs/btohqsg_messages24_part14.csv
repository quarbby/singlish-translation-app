May I check  will the HFE explicitly state that you are a 1st timer or 2nd timer?,btohqsg
Any news of bto results today ?,btohqsg
@Tien: No. HFE won't state if u areca 1st or 2nd timer.  You know it by yourself.IF you are given a chance to choose the unit & you didn't turn up  you will receive a letter confirming that you become a 2nd timer for the next project.,btohqsg
Normally out at 4pm if no have means wait,btohqsg
This one not POFMA bro. It's straight behind the bars liao 🤪,btohqsg

Ohh but I still have Bedok listed there which was a number but outside of supply,btohqsg
Is there any chat group for cmg pasir ris BTO ?,btohqsg
Any news of bto results ?,btohqsg
That’s like 2 months of waiting ?,btohqsg
No need to keep asking every day cos eventually the admins or one kind soul here will update in this chat that the result will be out😅 So sit back n relax 🙏🏼,btohqsg
Now hdb busy thinking of holiday,btohqsg

Hellloo can I check if there will be any reassessment of my finance nearer to key collection? Or the HDB loan amount is fixed during the initial HFE ?,btohqsg

"Hi  does any one know is ""Open Booking""=""SBF""?",btohqsg
So what is Open Booking? I heard this is opened all year round?,btohqsg
It's leftover of SBF.There are also launch(es) for it  but application is on FCFS basis. Currently no OBF available,btohqsg
Nope. If sbf open no more available flats then no more open bookingU must know open booking flat (OBF) is balance flats from Sale of Balanced projectsIf sale of balance projects mostly taken up then no more OBF,btohqsg
Oh I see. Ok understand now. Thanks Bern and Kris for the explanation. 👍,btohqsg
Your answer is the last sentence she gave.,btohqsg
Hello! If my HFE is valid till 28 Oct  I’ll likely be able to participate in Oct BTO exercise right? 😃,btohqsg
Think unless the Oct bto project is launched on 29 & 30 Oct then you cannot submit application  cos your HFE expired on 28 Oct.,btohqsg
I think if Oct bto is launched on 28 Oct  you cannot submit cos your HLF expire on 28 Oct means from 0001hrs on 28 Oct which your HLF already expired  to be exact I think your HLF is valid till 2359hrs on 27 Oct.Not sure my thought is correct?,btohqsg
May be some others very familiar with bto system in this group chat can advise better. 😀,btohqsg
Thank you Serena! 😊 That’s my thoughts too.,btohqsg
1 month before ur HFE ends  u will get sms from hdb reminding u to renew ur HFE. Do check the hfe portal for the notice too :),btohqsg
Awesome  thank you very much Jeff,btohqsg
Someone on hwz reported missing profile. Good luck everyone!,btohqsg
Yes and yes for both questions,btohqsg
HFE required for all application typesAny doc missing HDB will request from you during the HFE pending progressSome will wait until last minute that apply BTOThere are also last minute application didn't when through,btohqsg
Hi anyone applied for past BTO projects whose profile went missing but still had queue number? I’ve been hearing conflicting information 😬,btohqsg
