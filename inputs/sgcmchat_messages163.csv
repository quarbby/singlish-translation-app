"""i know it's not right to murder that family  but i did""",btohqsg
that's the most fucked reasoning i've seen in awhile lol,btohqsg
"this is *exactly* why you ""spotters"" are detested by owners.",btohqsg
the owner does not like people to take pics,btohqsg
our local scene is becoming like those train otakus in japan ngl,btohqsg
there's a reason why alot of owners don't bring out their cars nowadays,btohqsg
there was an incident where by a spotter scratched up a pretty rare hypercar.,btohqsg
don't know the aftermath and the ins and outs. but shit hit the fan.,btohqsg
Yo the kid is holding on to that tire swing w passion,btohqsg
but he did make a section of his fence/wall transparent.. so of course people would assume the cars are there for display and take pics? there is no peeking over fences or anyt  you can look straight at it when you walk pass his place so you can't fully put the blame on people taking pics,btohqsg
there have been quite a few instances whereby spotters have doneunusual and probably illegal stuffto get the shots,btohqsg
i.e  climbing on the fence  flying a drone over someone's house,btohqsg
not the same house  but you get the gist,btohqsg
yes there has been multiple times where spotters climb shit and peek over peoples gates and fences to take pics but in this case there is a section of the wall that is clear to show off the cars to the public,btohqsg
"not saying that they shouldn't take a pic or something  but stating something like ""i know its wrong but i still did it"" is abit dense",btohqsg
if it wasn't done illegally sure,btohqsg
peeking over fences and taking pics of people's houses is definitely wrong  but there's a section of glass in this case so I don't see it as illegal or outrageous,btohqsg
i know it's wrong to shit in my neighbour's plants,btohqsg
Recently one spotter climbed a rock to take a pic iirc,btohqsg
recently also one enthusiast stuck out of a sunroof in a subaru forester to take a pic iirc üòóüòó,btohqsg
ya LOL the one where he took pic of Steven's place right,btohqsg
Idk. But I remember some xdd touching the car,btohqsg
"""owner"" said DCT 190 better than manual",btohqsg
Hearsay he is the owners son. Seeing him touch the car very komedy,btohqsg
haha slap the rear end some more,btohqsg
arshooni? that guy is owner's son. not owner lol,btohqsg
The thing is they all unapologetical. And they say i dont see y cannot,btohqsg
I DONT SEE WHY I CANT TOUCH THAT CAR DESPITE THE SIGN!!!,btohqsg
Idk. Like just say nice cars.,btohqsg
His ego needs to be deflated,btohqsg
Ppl be like ok cool. Dont grind ppls gears say illegal and what not,btohqsg
Bro u ask me his agera ‚Äúrs‚Äù or e93,btohqsg
yes we were looking at the 93 more,btohqsg
Knn his agera S is jus an up badged to s+,btohqsg
i miss when we had original ageras.,btohqsg
I missed when the agera flipped at the bridge,btohqsg
Should have been the son ah,btohqsg
Then man builds another car that gets crashed. Finds and agera and races that,btohqsg
Wat. I talking about NFS the movie,btohqsg
didn't he get the keys or smt,btohqsg
The rich guy bought. Then he borrowed,btohqsg
whole movie was a pipe dream,btohqsg
"Idk. I just remembered  ""weep not for roads untravelled""",btohqsg
idk i only remember they did bogo cannonball,btohqsg
and every car got wiped out in the last race,btohqsg
Bro I swear the grey agera was real,btohqsg
which was a normal Veyron (kit car) with SS livery,btohqsg
i think they used it for close ups,btohqsg
Brake Bias looks 100% to the back,btohqsg
I Load weight in my rear,btohqsg

that T1 crash wasn't his fault,btohqsg

Same colour as the pole and the audi,btohqsg
You think merc or bmw better?,btohqsg
What type of cars like sedans or coupes or trucks or just the brand,btohqsg
this is one of the places where i disagree with@ArghMeinGott,btohqsg
my favourite type of car ‚Äúcars‚Äù,btohqsg
Like those sedan like f10 and all,btohqsg
both are equally good depending on your needs,btohqsg
If general hard to say ah,btohqsg
Fr fun i'd say bmw lorh  talking abt the higher specs like the 35-40i uk,btohqsg
ill show yr girl how the mercedes bends,btohqsg
All rounder i'd say merc? Like gran touring etc,btohqsg
Audi i say mix of both of them,btohqsg
it‚Äôs down to preference lol there‚Äôs always gonna somehow be a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù car,btohqsg
And if uw compare M and Amg also abit hard  cause the bmw F series and mercs w205 gen has this diff whr bmw is lighter but less powerful and merc is heavier with more power  but everything can change one lah uk,btohqsg
We compare audi n merc n bmw's sedans,btohqsg
S class vs A7 Vs 7 Series,btohqsg
Thn straight away merc wins imo,btohqsg
The s class is like a maybach but less atas,btohqsg
benz doesn‚Äôt look as good as bm,btohqsg
bro i‚Äôm on pie the fucking data is so shit,btohqsg
I thought u was chilling on like an apple pie ngl,btohqsg
The newest sedan rn is the G80 M3 for BMW,btohqsg
Whats there for merc n audi,btohqsg
but theres no like oopmh yk,btohqsg
It needs a lil bit of AMG or sum,btohqsg
Ya but u asked whats there fr them ah so i say them  half the cylinder and displacement tho,btohqsg
Thats why imo bmw is btter then audi n merc,btohqsg
No its good its just boring,btohqsg
u can buy 2 r8's for a huracan thats insane,btohqsg
"Yeahh  they quite ""cheap"" fr what they are",btohqsg
bro has never sat in an r8 before,btohqsg
u got like 4-5x the power,btohqsg
but u sit in it vry diff,btohqsg
I mean to each their own ahh  ntg bad with liking or nt,btohqsg
but i wld prefer a r8 over a huracan tho,btohqsg
Ok lah  use the access money do a full kit,btohqsg
if yr comparing first gen r8 u sld compare to the gallardo,btohqsg
Must compare the v10 plus one ahh,btohqsg
"Cause ""common"" ig  but performance wise def not",btohqsg

much much more road feel as opposed to the previous ones,btohqsg
builds up quite well on the Dirt 2.0 foundations  more pronounced under and oversteer,btohqsg
drawback is that it isn't that well optimised yet. with a 3090 it still has abit of lag at max graphics.,btohqsg
also the controls are a pain to bind,btohqsg
actually ngl the 4.0 looks like a monster truck compared to the Cup,btohqsg
is that an RSR or Cup,btohqsg
i think the RSR cup got yellow headlights,btohqsg
i will pester you until you sell,btohqsg
or if i do find one in japan then i won't,btohqsg
how about you sell at $1200 and i get your credit card for 1200 too,btohqsg
