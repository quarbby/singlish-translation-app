Okay guys go say hi to wyatt at spms,btohqsg
Youll never find another school that records every lecture  is fully airconditioned  has a canteen next to it and sofas for you to sleep,btohqsg
That much i can appreciate spms for,btohqsg
Since when Tampines got river one,btohqsg
This one is the old golden mile complex,btohqsg

How come telegram so many bots uh,btohqsg
not me chatgpt-ing my entire assignemnt too,btohqsg
tbf its a useless mod to me so i have no qualms chatgpting it,btohqsg
Like if itâ€™s useful and applicable to working world we def will learn it lah,btohqsg
Tell me I'm calling you  GPT.,btohqsg
if no world tour this year imma be sad,btohqsg
They said there is a tour,btohqsg
Is just dk what destinations the tour is other than SK,btohqsg
yeah thats what i meant mb,btohqsg
i feel like there is a chance they might give sg a miss,btohqsg

to enter uni  ppl need to score B and above cus the gpa fr most course is high,btohqsg
wait its actly harder than As,btohqsg
But even if they get gpa 3.5  it may also not be enough,btohqsg
A levels is more acedemic gearing to prep for uni  poly is more technical and hands on more towards industry and career,btohqsg
I find that most poly people who do well enough to get to uni will most likely continue to do well in uni,btohqsg
isit cause the structure is abt the same,btohqsg
u hv to make lots of connections in poly and uni,btohqsg
Yeah because at the end of the day its gpa,btohqsg
So poly people who make it to local uni already know how to stay consistent,btohqsg
They just have to do it for another 3-4 years in uni,btohqsg
That actually does work pretty well,btohqsg
My friend graduated with only 3.1  worked a few years  now he's back in ntu studying cs,btohqsg
