I’m gonna have to ask you to be more civil and less rude,btohqsg
lol op damn fail she didn't comprehend the message of the post,btohqsg
im pissed off at the implication that grades = to your self worth parts,btohqsg
The poster is playing by the OP’s own definitions,btohqsg
also the implication that if u didnt study 24/7 unlike this ITE guy u dont deserve ur success,btohqsg
The OP himself presents his bad grades as being negative,btohqsg
OP was tryna make a point that grades shouldnt equate ur self worth or should society judge u based on mere grades what,btohqsg
Then why did he talk about getting 90 RP,btohqsg
cuz he say after he get 90 rp everyone aroudn him treat him way differently,btohqsg
whereas when he used to get shit grades ppl just treat him like ...,btohqsg
u claim im wrong then state 0 points,btohqsg
when u have 0 points there’s nothing the opposite side can rebut on,btohqsg
did people really treat him like trash tho?,btohqsg
lol ive been on the side of having both awesome grades and terrible grades,btohqsg
he got treated the way he deserved to be treated what  you go to school  your teachers advise u to study hard udw listen to them,btohqsg
yes  peoplet treat u damn differently,btohqsg
i don't think he will be envious leh,btohqsg
did u see his previous history,btohqsg
even i will also don't care about you what,btohqsg
i 好心好意 give u good advise,btohqsg
u lan lan dw listen to me,btohqsg
why shd i care abt you,btohqsg
Personally I feel that teachers have way better relationships with poorer performing kids cause they need to interact with them more,btohqsg
ppl r human  why u expect ppl to not treat u different when u ignore their good intentions,btohqsg
yah  i can attest to that LOL,btohqsg
Better performing kids just use their teachers as QnA machine,btohqsg
i dont think teachers treat u less of a human just cos ur grades r bad lol,btohqsg
i think whatever OP wrote in his/her previous post is just his/her own delusion,btohqsg
him trying to fit his own victim narrative into the story,btohqsg
i think OP super melodramatic lol,btohqsg
this type of stupid a level sob story,btohqsg
its basically an attention seeking  melodramatic hit piece to get attention  ~positive vibes~ and self validation,btohqsg
omg i overcame my non-problems and inability to get my shit together because i was short sighted and ill disciplined despite being in a privileged position to achieve 90 rp at an elite jc,btohqsg
how is that a good story,btohqsg
which is like 80% of the sob story posts on sgexams,btohqsg
U rejoined just to say this,btohqsg
lol she couldn't take the heat,btohqsg
so common among a level grads  particularly those from better JCs,btohqsg
an inability to accept that maybe their worldview might not be correct,btohqsg
lol this is exactly the hostility that got me pissed off at u,btohqsg
and then u failed to address any of my points  so lemme throw that back at you,btohqsg
i left cuz i dont wanna fucking deal with bullshit from interweb strangers without even a dp in the first place,btohqsg
Friends let me remind you all to not be rude to each other,btohqsg
it’s cuz ur a fucking nobody to me  and i dont want to reply to a goddamn who knows who is behind this username stranger,btohqsg
is that not an open for me,btohqsg
im very chill its u keep roasting me,btohqsg
i qn ur narrative u explode,btohqsg
bruh im the most fucking open minded person ever  my best friend is literally someone politically directly opposite to me,btohqsg
i literally complained to someone online for releasing a lvl stats earlier (illegally) and got massive downvotes I also liddat,btohqsg
but it just shows that singaporeans are 3rd world citizens,btohqsg
but ik its a student who leaked it,btohqsg
this time of kachang putih matter,btohqsg
if u give official secret to student,btohqsg
ye  but im aware is a student who leaked it,btohqsg
oh u know who is it,btohqsg
cos my friend was in one of those classes who the cher talked abt it way before,btohqsg
What's the best way to reconcile with a friend after some terrible arguments and quarrels in the past ?,btohqsg
even if get charged  will still get away scot free,btohqsg
got potential to excel in life,btohqsg
not like the pjc student go cycle to nus right,btohqsg
What if they turned their heads when they look at me,btohqsg
pjc no future that's why can charge,btohqsg
if from RJC or HCI no charge,btohqsg
You mean turn their heads away from you?,btohqsg
use ur mouth and ask la,btohqsg
If the pj guy can make it to nus then no charge also lmao,btohqsg
thats why recently someone kenna charged ma,btohqsg
yah but PJ guy in NS what,btohqsg
nsf's are the lowest scum in society,btohqsg
What if they scream and shout and humiliate you Infront of everyone,btohqsg
den u still want be friends with them meh,btohqsg
i was surprised also  but no surprise also,btohqsg
We got some Indian JPJC guy in my squad  fucking autistic,btohqsg
Well I wanted to avoid that from happening,btohqsg
den don tbe friends with them lah,btohqsg
we cant help u to figure out ur insecurity for u leh HAHA,btohqsg
? ord loh what is squad,btohqsg
I do want to be friends tho,btohqsg
there is no right or wrong answer,btohqsg
It's just I'm afraid of the outcome,btohqsg
The last thing I did was saying hi to them without looking at them and running away after that,btohqsg
this is a binary choice u presented,btohqsg
so there is only a binary answer,btohqsg
U can't control everything. The best you can is try to be sincere about your ihtentions,btohqsg
This is what i do after a long time of not talking and the quarrels?,btohqsg
Man the last thing I did to them saying hi and running away. Then the next day  they saw me and gave a really long eye contact and I kinda got distracted after that so I didn't get to greet them,btohqsg
I think they wanted the reconciliation as well but I just didnt do it properly,btohqsg
Was too scared of the outcome idk why,btohqsg
Then after that everytime they crossed by me  they'll just ignore,btohqsg
Or pretend to ignore we'll never know,btohqsg
I think I gotta little of guts now,btohqsg
The longer you take to reconcile  the harder it will get. Sooner the easier. Yes it'll be scary  it's a risk. If you don't try  it's 0% chance of success. If you try  it won't be 0%. It may not work  but at least you'll know if it works  or if you should just move on.,btohqsg
Thanks man I'll gather up my guts and do it tomorrow,btohqsg
Its better to acknowledge what happened too  but know to move on frm thr will be the better option,btohqsg
If it's something you did that caused the quarrel  also do acknowledge it. Worst thing in reconciliation is always to say how you were right and you willing to forgive others,btohqsg
Wtf is this hot take - it's always this yukeming guy with so many hot takes.You can see his opinion on jobs too.,btohqsg
but i see this im like wtf,btohqsg
Maybe he doesn't need the street cred required for getting a job,btohqsg
This is so true  and I know it can sound empty to a lot of people.But the fact is you have an overwhelming (almost surely by current samples) probability of dying within 300 Earth years  what are you going to do with it?,btohqsg
hot take whereby u have to type a wall of text seething like an incel and put down some internet stranger,btohqsg
Idk bro he probably had this thought inside him for a while and needed an outlet to get it out,btohqsg
Not every angry rant should be discredited for being an angry rant,btohqsg
Maybe because i can understand what he's saying and why  since I'm a retainee too,btohqsg
these are examples of what im referring to as condescending and shitty to say,btohqsg
These are things that people say to emphasise their point informally on the internet when they are angry,btohqsg
then i can randomly call someone a faggot too,btohqsg
it’s the implication that OP is a piece of shit just cuz he didnt study his arse off that pisses me off,btohqsg
the original post was basically a melodrama to garner positive vibes and validation,btohqsg
den the response was exposing that,btohqsg
no he is a piece of shit cos he is insinuating other people are treating him like trash because of his bad grades and painting a false picture  when it in actuality its when OP didn't listen to good advice and went against it,btohqsg
that's why people treat him like garbage,btohqsg
only childish ppl treat ppl like trash for bad grades,btohqsg
if u followed the other guy's reddit posts (the one in the reply posted above)   hes lowkey flexing in most of his comments,btohqsg
the guy who wrecked the original post ah,btohqsg
maybe he is just super blunt,btohqsg
but nvm lah if we take just this post in isolation  his points still stand,btohqsg
i only agree with that reply post above,btohqsg
Blunt or not  there's this thing called1. being WRONG2. being rude3. doing illegal things.,btohqsg
cos the op is actually a lowkey flexer,btohqsg
otherwise  the yukeming guy is quite rude in other posts,btohqsg
its not a 'motivational' story if you are from an IP school,btohqsg
idk his other posts bro  im just stating his singular post in the pic above,btohqsg
exactly the point i stated before,btohqsg
post stated gpa in secondary school and i was life wtf since when secondary school got gpa,btohqsg
den i realized it was one of the elite schools lol,btohqsg
This is pretty biased too. I think it depends on how much you can acknowledge the playing field though.,btohqsg
if one has a chance to have access to papers created by these schools  you will realise why they are actually 'uniquely difficult' in their way as compared to most schs,btohqsg
Bruh. I went to NOT-RI and I could do RI papers,btohqsg
Difficult papers don't mean jack shit.,btohqsg
how is that biased  its like saying a rich kid has shit grades and if he succeeds its a motivational story,btohqsg
You can try for the ecole polytechnique IX entrance exams - not sure who's going to teach you how to do them  but most likely you'll do worse than other A-level students who just ...studied A-levels.,btohqsg
I already qualified it - it depends on whether the rich kid can acknowledge he or she has had a different environment.,btohqsg
in this case the rich kid didn't,btohqsg
it was the fault of the teachers  op parents  op cca commitments blah blah but not op,btohqsg
Hating on rich people donating to the poor  because of the notion that they robbed the poor in the first place isn't really going to convince the rich to help the poor. When the instance of help is concrete  you can't just say 'haha but all of your money is toxic and you probably wanted a lower tax bill',btohqsg
op's not at wrong for screwing up,btohqsg
that's different  in this case the help wasn't concrete,btohqsg
the post smelt more like some self validation post,btohqsg
All I'm saying is that opinions without sufficient context don't really make sense.,btohqsg
why are we even arguing over this  the person who complained about this post has disappeared,btohqsg
cos the moment her narrative got shattered she didn't dare to stand up for it,btohqsg
Well everyone has different capabilities. Doesn't mean you are not in an elite school means you are less smart etc.,btohqsg
just cuz i not here 24/7 to reply to people with no pfp and shitty nicknames,btohqsg
people got better things to do,btohqsg
no point  the topic has gone stale,btohqsg
The only thing that can be said is that possibly (I massively doubt it) is that RI papers have different pedagogical value to them. It's not about being hard - it's about whether after doing the paper  you learnt something out of doing it.,btohqsg
Well i agree with that. The paper actually forces ppl to think,btohqsg
if not for the fact im in a censored envt i'd roast u to death,btohqsg
i'll one up u on the offer,btohqsg
if u actually have a valid argument and roast me properly  i'll concede the loss :),btohqsg
But to add on ye the story is nothingHad friends who got kicked to O level track  saw their friends/entire class rusticated from the school at year 4 (while they made it back to IP stream) and did well for A levelsThats what I call successful.,btohqsg
This is wrong and I feel offended.,btohqsg
but if no response then it speaks volumes lor,btohqsg
your arguments are very world shattering!!!,btohqsg
I don't see why that post would spark off a pointless argument,btohqsg
yah its quite pointless i agree,btohqsg
Idk too  but it actually sparks some food for thought,btohqsg
i feel like wow!! i never see a seething incel my whole life before!!!,btohqsg
I honestly don't see why 'success' is defined in terms of examinations,btohqsg
are your roasts like so one dimensional that you have to copy off liberal talking points,btohqsg
You know both of you getting kicked out after this right,btohqsg
I'll miss you man. I'm only here for the memes.,btohqsg
no leh i think im quite respectful,btohqsg
omg if u want insult me pls dont do it here ahahha. and if ur roast is this level pls..go skillsfuture,btohqsg
Generally most confrontations are 2-sided.You also said yes to 'IDM a debate' - that's enough proof to YEET you,btohqsg
