"Hmm.. did they scan the QR code before they complete the payment? Some POS are quite stupid  before the cashier does a ""checkout""  must scan the membership first. If not they need to void the entire transaction once they ""checkout"".Not only regarding Shell GO+  others like yuu app works similarly. I got ""conned"" out of my yuu points because the cashier didn't know how to operate the yuu membership scanning portion.",btohqsg
I never use iChange.. just give you sad reaction for your long wait ü•≤,btohqsg
I did the scan first before payment. But from what I see in the uob website   I have a strong feeling they assume it was all other uob card rather then one card,btohqsg

Hahah Yeap. It‚Äôs just another $3.3But anyway thanks all for your input. Much appreciated,btohqsg
A suggestion‚Ä¶ if you have hsbc revo to pair it with XNAP instead of PPV as there‚Äôs no $5 block in hsbc revo‚Ä¶ and given hawker food is lower in price you probably want each $1 to yield you 4mpd,btohqsg
I will probably explore1). $500 UOB One2). $600 Evol3). $Maybank FnF $900Vs UOB One $2000.If you have $200k saving  then possibly include OCBC card with OCBC 360 together with UOB one account n card in your consideration.,btohqsg
