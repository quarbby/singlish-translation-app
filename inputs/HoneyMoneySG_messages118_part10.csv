prorated rebate for 2months of first quarter,btohqsg
the prorated is based on calendar quarter?,btohqsg
If I visit gain city  make payment and require installment plan. Am I just able to gain the mile for the card?,btohqsg
Did you miss 1 statement month?,btohqsg
the thing is never missed statement month   but i did change my statement dates from 12 to last day of every month,btohqsg
Is the instalment plan by services like Atome  gain city or in conjunction with the bank? Instalment plan like Atome still possible  with bank then no.,btohqsg
i applied during 28 march received about 7 april. Then changed the date to last date of every month.So my statement dates are 1st apr - 30 apr   may 1 - may 31  then june 1 to june 30  by right today should be the end of my 3rd statement,btohqsg
Meaning they bill you instead of setting up the installment through bank,btohqsg
Okay understand. So if I using a uob card and apply for 0 percent interest thru the bank is no right,btohqsg
The first statement quarter is always messy. Last time got similar conversation.It might become 1 - 31 Mar  1 - 30 Apr and 1 - 31 May. Because you're only supposed to receive the cashback on the end of the next statement month  and because you received in Jun  it's likely you missed Mar.But already better than those who change the statement month after first statement quarter  because they don't get the prorated benefit.,btohqsg
so in this case june will be my 1st   july 2nd   august 3rd  then when reaching the end of sept then the cashback will show up in my statement right?,btohqsg
Yup. Not sure if you can check with CSO on your statement quarter period.,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtsupposed you already pull funds out yesterday/friday to another bank?,btohqsg
Oh ya. Jul and Aug 31 days ü§£Shag leh now they play this 30 days thing.,btohqsg
Do you guys recommend I get the second month with SC Esaver or switch this month to HSBCHistory:MAY‚óè Esaver N/A‚óèHsbc 100 KJune 4th‚óè opened SC esaver   moved 108 K  maintained it till today  got 267 SGD interest‚óè HSBC 5k average to keep my Premier accountJuly Two scenarios:‚óè Esaver : Will I still get 3.5 % out of 108 K ( reference month May  at that time i didn'thave account ) ? *I'm not really sure*‚óè Move the 108 K to HSBSC 3.55 % on 103 K increment or drop it ans move August instead given SC is only two first months,btohqsg
The Jun one withdrawn on 31 May?,btohqsg
"Any bro or sis tried to convince UOB Solitare that a $3K facial treatment package with V Medical Aesthetic Clinic should qualify for 10x points under ""Beauty and Wellness"" bonus category selected? It's so unintuitive to be not.",btohqsg
I‚Äôm never a just in time master.I always have buffer and do earlier,btohqsg
It's the merchant that declare their MCC.,btohqsg
Guys  anybody buy fund though ocbc to get the extra 1.5 % for ocbc360? Can let me know which fund?,btohqsg
Can't verify their MCC. But Heymax said its 8099 which is not whitelisted under UOB beauty category.,btohqsg
Go n make another $1 payment using Amaze empty wallet method to verify the mcc.,btohqsg
If I've withdrawn my EGA funds on 1 June  theoretically if I sign up and move the funds back in on 2 Jul  it should be considered as fresh funds right?,btohqsg
No. Promotion starts on 1 Jul.,btohqsg
But it was not withdrawn within the last 30 days what...,btohqsg
Hahaha need more data points to see if they really have system to do it.,btohqsg
T&Cs didn't state past 30 days within start of promotion period. It just says past 30 days.,btohqsg
Its veey hard to understand the wording,btohqsg
Can register  referral link can be found@sgpromocode,btohqsg
You can try and provide the dp in Oct üò¨,btohqsg
ü§£ü§£ they can always claw back after Oct when they find a way to do it.,btohqsg
This is hsbc I don‚Äôt think they know how to clawback,btohqsg
Your faith in them is so low. ü§£,btohqsg
They do everything manually one. Even bonus interest is manually calculated with excel I heard,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why their bonus interest (last time) is credited over a few days. lol.Maybe now changed la.,btohqsg
Hi all  Would like to check something.. I have used my amaze+CRMC overseas  first 2 transactions were ok. But suddenly it got blocked. Is it because Citibank or Amaze? Anyone face the same issue before while overseas ?,btohqsg
HAHAHA. Maybe now different liao la. So many people how they calculate manually. I see their cashback quite fast and accurate  I'm sure they have invested in a new system.,btohqsg
Amaze. That's why you should always have backup card like YouTrip.,btohqsg
Oh I see.. what should I do if I‚Äôm back in sg? Email / Call Amaze or Citibank,btohqsg
Agree with this but YouTrip should be ultimate backup since no rewards.Usually it‚Äôs a 4-6 mpd card with amaze at the forefront for me.Then amaze + crmc as backupThen Uob vs as backupAll fail then YouTrip,btohqsg
I was thinking is it because I didn‚Äôt get to authorise the transaction in time from Citibank app that‚Äôs why Amaze block,btohqsg
Anyone knows if moomoo has already announced their new promotions for July ? 6.8% will continue ?,btohqsg
Oh? Got such thing? Citi sent u something,btohqsg
Ya got notification to authorise transaction,btohqsg
Then u have your answer Loh.Interesting though. I never got any in app approval request while using amaze.Only when linking with amaze first time.,btohqsg
Ya I didn‚Äôt get it before too and only this time.. just feeling helpless overseas but thanks   will call Citibank up,btohqsg
Since amaze crmc no longer works. U can try delinking and relinking crmc with amaze now ,btohqsg
Uob vs naked the fx fees high right,btohqsg
Still positive.4mpd - 4% fx fee = positive benefit.,btohqsg
HSBC drunk while drafting T&C...so many logic inconsistencies. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
