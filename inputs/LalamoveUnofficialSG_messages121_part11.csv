You can stack order  but ensure you deliver within the 1 hour time frame as per LLM requirements.,btohqsg
U stack and late.. what u Wana resolve ?,btohqsg
If stack order late then lan lan one,btohqsg
You can stack order but still need to complete within 1hr,btohqsg

Guys de price for 2.4m van i saw had been reduce fr $38 to $32 base price.....isit permanent?,btohqsg
Those who do full time how ah,btohqsg
My honest opinion Bro  if you wanna stack. You must be aware that there are risks. So if customer complain  bo pian have to bite the bullet. Honestly when I stack also  I‚Äôm aware of the gamble and pray that they don‚Äôt complain. ü´§I feel your pain  but we know that LLM is customer oriented. Which means customers‚Äô always come first. 90% we ‚Äúappeal‚Äù likely not to be heard.We can never find the fine prints of their ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù against drivers coz we are always at LLM mercy. üòî,btohqsg
Those doing full time slog 12-14 hours on the road just to make ends meet from rental  petrol and parking charges.Some of the LLM whom shared their experiences with me along the way will likely slog it out.,btohqsg
my first day of llm alrdy kena complaint  i gg alrdy,btohqsg
As the saying goes. Want to do anything also can   dun get caught. If kena then just accept it and move on.,btohqsg
I think oodle orders auto investigate for all late orders kne,btohqsg
It‚Äôs damn ridiculous nonetheless. At least Pickupp is upfront about their late penalty as to how many percents they deduct.,btohqsg
Deducting more than what the order pays is bullying,btohqsg
Lol. That's when they pay you for waiting for the order.But when the requestor wait for you is a different story. Sometimes they have to refund even up to 50% of what customer pay + compensation of customer's items (especially if is perishable),btohqsg
Hi i‚Äôm new to lalamove. can i check what‚Äôs the easiest way to do back to back like grab system etc,btohqsg
