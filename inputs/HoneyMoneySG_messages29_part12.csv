Is it possible to deposit cash on arm without card ?I know withdraw can use phone tap and draw funds,btohqsg
As long as u have the account number,btohqsg
Anyone know the limit for paywave for CRMC and HSBC Revolution ?,btohqsg
In theory it's no limit but some retailers have internal policies. Best is to use Apple Pay or Google Pay so that the merchant can't insert your card into the reader and your 4 mpd üí∏,btohqsg
Can I bump this again sorry,btohqsg
I‚Äôm worried that if I don‚Äôt spend for one month  I‚Äôll not get the extra interest in my savings account for the entire year,btohqsg
if they insert into reader  we can‚Äôt get miles ah,btohqsg
For Revolution  you only get 4 mpd for paywave or online,btohqsg
what about the citi rewards card? both is mostly the same except one has annual fee + focused on cash back; and the other one no annual fee + focused on miles,btohqsg
I understand some people also just apply for the card and use it for a year then cancel it after  any issues w card hopping per say?,btohqsg
I think you mixed UOB ONE Account and UOB ONE Card. If you're referring to the UOB ONE Card  the cashback for that quarter will be forfeited.,btohqsg
I mean UOB One acc. That also has a requirement of 500 min spend per month to get the max interest,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think in some restaurant I can hand the waiter my phone ? ü§£,btohqsg
If you're referring to the UOB ONE Account then the interest rate for the month will be back to base interest of 0.05% pa if you don't hit the minimum spending of $500.,btohqsg
already answered u? Affect one month only,btohqsg
CRMC is a mile focused card with 4mpd  it best paired with amaze to convert all online and no FCY fees with okay spread. I think you are mixing up with Citi cashback. And Citi reward is more flexible when combined with amaze cause any online transaction get you 4mpd while hsbc only those on the mcc whitelist,btohqsg
Oh so only for that month the interest will be affect not for the entire year,btohqsg
If you're using both UOB ONE Card and Account  then would be best if you don't forget to spend the first $500  else all bonuses will be gone. üòÖ,btohqsg
if im using uob absolute but my monthly exp is less than 1k should i cancel and apply for citi rewards?,btohqsg
Uob interest plus uob one Cashback,btohqsg
HSBC revolution or Citi reward with amaze  I think you can keep the absolute for certain payments that are excluded,btohqsg
cuz still need pay yearly principal tho,btohqsg
I think you can just get it waiver,btohqsg
Nope  it combined with CRMC  it convert all of transactions to online which mean anything you spend other then excluded is 4mpd,btohqsg
Plus you get benefits of foreign currency,btohqsg
Still got the other UOB cards that can be used together with the UOB ONE account ma haha.,btohqsg
cuz for foreign i using youtripcurrently,btohqsg
I‚Äôm more toward  using amaze cause as Chris explain in his video about YouTrip vs amaze Amaze allow you to earn your credit card reward which is nett positive saving if use the right card while YouTrip you nett loss always due to spreadhttps://youtu.be/xF59pilsDPo,btohqsg
so if i‚Äôm understanding you correctly  would it be right to say that there wouldn‚Äôt be any difference between revolution and citi rewards in terms of mpd if i use them both w amaze?,btohqsg
HSBC cannot use with amaze  hsbc only earn if it under the whitelist MCCCRMC + amaze has lesser restriction on spending to earn 4mpd,btohqsg
Example online telecomm payment CRMC can earn 4mpd but revolution cannot,btohqsg
I think should make a police report to safeguard herself,btohqsg
Hi guys  if anyone have klook vouchers code that u dun need  pls share with me. Thank u in advance!,btohqsg
Haha just tell the waiter you want to pay by apple pay and go to the counter to pay,btohqsg
Is it right to say that if I only make 1 Syfe Trade a month  I would not incur any buying charges. Given Syfe Trade does not charge platform fee unlike Syfe Wealth (around 0.65% per annum). Excluding the selling charges on Syfe Trade,btohqsg
hihi anyone experience any issues using amaze overseas??,btohqsg
you got enable overseas spend  magnetic strip transaction etc?,btohqsg
lol i haven‚Äôt fly yet just wondering if the user experience is good to see if i should use it‚Ä¶,btohqsg
For nets flashpay topup  besides amex (which I was rejected) + grabpay  which one can get rebates?,btohqsg
When can re-apply for amex after rejection?,btohqsg
Used it in Malaysia haven‚Äôt had any issues,btohqsg
The amaze card can only be added to Google Pay. Still no luck for Apple Pay? Dun want to bring any physical card‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Then I stick to hsbc revo,btohqsg
Haha. No one is interested about my issue...,btohqsg
Maybe they are not in that situation that‚Äôs why no reply,btohqsg
to get back some ‚Äúrewards‚Äù from insurance  likely will have to use the typical card up or payall,btohqsg
For ega giro is credit payment considered?,btohqsg
To add. I used EVOL on 26 Jun for Simplygo (via Google Pay) but was posted on 30 Jun. Also the same on 26 Apr for Simplygo  posted on 30 Apr. Both I didn't get 8% cashback.,btohqsg
does anyone know what transaction can be posted immediately from HSBC credit card side? I signed up for HSBC revolution card and forgot about the $500 spending criteria and tonight is the deadline,btohqsg
From Singpost website  seems like AMEX is okay to pay for MOE bills,btohqsg
