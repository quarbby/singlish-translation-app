UPDATE: Malaysian police have recovered thestolen Honda Civic Type-Rfive days after it disappeared.They found it in a condominium’s parking lot in Sepang  Selangor  roughly 130km away from Genting Highlands.For more news you must share  follow us at@mustsharenews,btohqsg
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/singapore-porsche-car-convoy-dangerous-overtaking-johor-kota-tinggi-2823106Sian la.And the Malaysian police didn't mention about the driver who allegedly took this video while driving. 🤔,btohqsg
And@SGCM_AdminI really wish you can relook into your Facebook caption by your colleagues. Will you be happy if the Porsche were really stolen or vandalized because of this? The video itself is very toxic. While yes  some overtake can be on the dangerous side  but it seems that the driver who took the video is eating sour grapes.,btohqsg
Hi@skylar313sorry for the late reply. Was driving. We noted your previous comment earlier but wanted to see if others had a similar opinion to yours.The caption that was provided was definitely not in the hopes that 'the Porsche/s would be stolen or vandalized'. It was simply riding off the recent trending incident of the Type R being stolen. - J,btohqsg
We of course value everyone's opinion and don't want to downplay your concerns. So what would you suggest we change it to then? - J,btohqsg
"""porsche did nth wrong  why ppl k p k b?""",btohqsg
So@Jingxunndo you think the caption was in bad taste as well?,btohqsg
honestly if i caption the article  it will offend more people😂😂,btohqsg
obviously implying their car to be stolen and vandalized is wrong la but  i think not censoring their plates etc is ultimate d*ck move,btohqsg
we have seen how evil ppl can be.. case in point  6000 cerato,btohqsg
but young man work as operations exec can afford fk8r.... what company sia i want change job liao,btohqsg
if the onboarding need to get tattoo idm also,btohqsg
I suspected too when I dun see part 2 to your text 😂,btohqsg
Tbh. We go to other country. Just need to behave ourselves. Indeed Malaysians are much worst  why follow. Just my 2cents  they asking for it + the jealous driver who took video. And the double white line. Why crossed  red card almost hit the motorcyclists.,btohqsg
Alot youngster also can afford exp car now adays.,btohqsg
Wish i had only car loan committment to service,btohqsg
Agreed that the double line was crossed but the motorcyclist had moved out to the edge of the lane after seeing the car signal already  and the overtaking was done in a manner permitted by law in the case of most vehicles,btohqsg
The point is that we know how vicious and aggressive people are on social media these days and not blurring the plates of these cars doesn't do any good for anyone except possibly harm these cars and their owners,btohqsg
Also one must remember  these convoys tend to be well connected via walkies and have spotters as well who can communicate and tell the car if it is safe to make the overtaking manoeuvre from their angle,btohqsg
And if this was a regular group of cars doing the same or even worse  I doubt they would've made it on the news and it probably wouldn't have spread so far,btohqsg
No point spreading more negativity in life!,btohqsg
J’s Cerato is the fiercest I have seen-R,btohqsg

@awj_moodwill be very upset with you,btohqsg
Why are you “Mr Mood” instead of Imran,btohqsg
Yes  that is correct. A convoy of Singapore registered porsches are indeed eyesore to the person recording the video.But they forgotten  these people are going to spend in malaysia and boost their tourism revenue!,btohqsg
So you admit to being the 3rd walking encyclopedia,btohqsg
This place is super crowded in the mornings. If you haven't tried the horginal beef noodle at the same coffershop  can give a shot too. As well as the prawn noodles opposite at block 704,btohqsg
They should host one. Like a mini rally,btohqsg
Beef noodle is legit! I had it the other day when@SGCM_AdminType J wasn’t there,btohqsg
I come from JB to eat at your shop sir,btohqsg
But mounts increase nvh. I would say arbs  endlinks etc etc before going to mounts.And wearing parts of the suspension is the best excuse to upgrade them 😎,btohqsg

Chef by day  racer by night,btohqsg
Jk my fd can barely overtake bluesg,btohqsg
I dont think it was done in properly manner based on the video. Especially base on safety of road users. I gotta agree with you on the blanking out plate numbers as its for safety for the drivers.I've followed convoys before. Indeed we are connected by walkies. But that doesnt mean safety is not priority and also behaving in their road also is priority to protect our sg image when in their country. Obviously it is a 2 way road  convoy and also watch the road limit. Anyway whats the rush. Unless convoy on the N.S. highway.,btohqsg
As long not double white line,btohqsg
"There's always eyesore between two countries. But the actions on their road just will make us singaporeans look bad. We dont need to use such superiority words like ""going over  good business for msia"" and for what ? We need them to cross bother to de-stress too.",btohqsg

Yup should be the same. Should be the diesel one😂,btohqsg
this one uses petrol  not diesel,btohqsg
Ohh. New engine?The 216 AT and GT was diesel,btohqsg
216 looks great  a classic BMW,btohqsg
The 216 GT and AT were offered with both diesel and petrol powertrains,btohqsg
An i after the number refers to a petrol powertrain,btohqsg
Ohhh I seeI Always thought only diesel😂 thanks for clarification,btohqsg
Many of the phv ones we see and the GTs are diesels because of offers back then and diesel being cheaper than petrol,btohqsg
I seeI heard the diesel can run 1000km / tank 😱,btohqsg

A not so gentle reminder for everyone to check their tire pressures and check on the condition of their tires,btohqsg
Best is everytime you pump petrol  go check your air pressure 👍🏼,btohqsg
Got air pump on every fuel pump slot,btohqsg
when pump tyres i heard some ppl like use premium air,btohqsg
they top up their indicator fluid at the same time,btohqsg
because the pressure control more accurate,btohqsg
I do this monthly  gotta be a responsible car owner to ensure my car in good proper order.,btohqsg
With the low RPM  you are likely to use nearly the full power. 107bhp on a torquey engine is enough,btohqsg
hp dont really matter much haha  more about torque and when the torque comes in,btohqsg
the car is meant for city driving as ling as torque comes in before 2k should be adequate to drive smoothly around town,btohqsg
if u go msia cfm kena smoked by myvi one,btohqsg
Can hear the fear of others as it approaches,btohqsg
I would too. Lambo impress women  gtr impress men lol,btohqsg
Agreed. Even the interior has been so modernized  it doesnt look racy anymore. Ecept the seats. The ctr supposed to be a boy race dream,btohqsg
It is a marvel  but i dont think reviewer managed to get the time under 5s,btohqsg
"real world is 5s tested in ""msia""",btohqsg
And im skeptical about the power delivery on the street. E.g. when u in eco mode and have the sudden need for harder acceleration  how smooth is the transition and power delivery?,btohqsg
only when u change from electric and turn on the engine,btohqsg
change from electric to engine  abit of j3rk,btohqsg
but thats negligeble when you are already rolling,btohqsg
its quite impressive to me la HAHA,btohqsg
Oh is that so. Then its not fair for the other cars  they could have been faster too. But then again  they wont be able to build the revs before launch.To 9k and to the moon! Hahaha,btohqsg
i mean  most cars are first feet of rollout,btohqsg
but yeah u will never get below 5s stock,btohqsg
but w tune... cant say the same😈😈,btohqsg
Ya thats the transition that i feel cannot be perfect. Impressive but not perfect.,btohqsg
I never got to test drive. Apparantly they dont allow test for the t8s if u dont put deposit.,btohqsg
maybe i nvr sit enough cars to have a good bench mark,btohqsg
Haha must be level playing ground ma. With tune the m340i would have obilerated the t8 even more. Sorry bmw fan boy,btohqsg
I never driven hybrid  thats im skeptical lol,btohqsg
I sat in prius  but nobody launches them for me to feel the real transition,btohqsg
cos they have a system to auto burn fuel if the fuel stays in for too long,btohqsg
so my friend tried real world everyday charge and dont use petrol,btohqsg
Serious? Lol. Thats like a weird system,btohqsg
must ma  if not the petrol will spoil in the tank,btohqsg
plus the engine needs to run once in a while to be healthy,btohqsg
Yea i was thinking somewhere along the lines of that. Flushing the fuel lines and clearing the carbon and gases,btohqsg
I was watching ys khong doing the hull climb on the s60 t8. It did pretty well despite the weight. But didn't get to see the power transition,btohqsg

its quite common for this kind of older german cars especially in the 2000s generation. This cars are the transition from very complex mechanical tech to introduce electronics into the car. They tend to develop alot of issues w reliability. Electronics can really be a pain in the 4ss when you have air suspension and all those intricate parts that are not in production anymore. This parts cost a bomb due to their rarity and mostly needs to be imported from overseas. Afterall  these guys are cheap for a reason.,btohqsg

To be fair  better is quite subjective tho.The C180 may provide additional comfort to the driver and passengers as compared to the Type R. So it all depends on the buyer and what he/she is seeking for in a car😄-R,btohqsg

Hi anyone know is it good to put rear aircon with usb charging for Honda vezel? 🙏,btohqsg
270k can buy tesla performance. 0-100kph 3.3sec,btohqsg
Why would you want to do that?Vezel small car. Aircon powerful enough.If not cold Maybe you need to do Aircon servicing.Wash fan blowerTop up gasWash Aircon radiator,btohqsg
So happening 😅 like H.K Drama. Police Story 2022,btohqsg
Ppl want to save money Ma. USB aircon no need petrol.,btohqsg
Because rear passenger complained no aircon. So going to fix it today. But the installer recommended me to put in usb charging port. Wondering is it good for the car? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg
No la. Go do servicing. You install rear blower  also need spend 250+Aircon will break down also sooner or later if never service,btohqsg
USB aircon $10+ can already la,btohqsg
He rather dies than spend  another sec with the wife🫢,btohqsg
I think usb fan can already,btohqsg
I am installing this type of rear aircon. Just that don’t know want to add the usb charging port. This is for personal car. Not driving grab.,btohqsg
Personal car no need care passengers 1. Not happy ask them take mrt,btohqsg
If you do not have a requirement for the USB port  don't do it,btohqsg
If you feel like you will need it at some point of time can consider,btohqsg
I believe it should be a plug and play install as some variants overseas do come with rear aircon,btohqsg
If it is a plug and play install for the USB port go ahead,btohqsg
If it involves the cutting of wires  would refrain from doing so as it can cause electrical issues down the line,btohqsg
And most definitely voids your warranty if you have any on most electric components,btohqsg

ur new listing of the day?,btohqsg
Slow in modern day terms  but still quick enough. More like a refined gentleman  and name not tarnished yet unlike other marques. Yes reliability will be the biggest issue. But my guess is if can afford these kind of cars  can afford leaving in the workshop for 3 months haha,btohqsg
Damn right. It exudes class all over,btohqsg
Ya this is probably the most affordable tuner car these days. If u want o e let me know. My friend is selling the tofu one,btohqsg
I second this. And the leon sports tourer. But on the street  nothing within that performance range can beat the tesla,btohqsg
U need something way faster to catch it,btohqsg
Evs tend to lose stram at the high ramge but by then u are pretty far ahead and going at least 180kph,btohqsg
Haha didnt know his name. He's a nut too. Not jefferson level but still a lot. I dont think i have even half his experience,btohqsg
His Instagram handle really does sum his personality up,btohqsg
