that's all a stereotype of ITE lol (according to Min Chan  it's not getting your kid into a good school  but entering a school good to your kid in terms of educational pace and focus),btohqsg
i lowkey wanna try a vape tho,btohqsg
what's your l1r5 for the prelims?,btohqsg
gd to hear that  otherwise i might have to redirect you to MOH's site on harmful effects of vaping (so you can write a full essay on it and discuss for 30 minutes straight on it in future),btohqsg
anyways i wont collect my results bc im working,btohqsg
i think that shld be sufficient to enter some courses in poly.,btohqsg
yeah but my f9 was math,btohqsg
Plus you're more likely to improve from prelims as you sound like you place huge emphasis on academic grades,btohqsg
lol there was 2 mths to push it up possibly to C5 or even a B3,btohqsg
i genuinely feel you're overthinking a lot.,btohqsg
idk i hv to wait for results dayy,btohqsg
and decide on the best course of action,btohqsg
ugh ite graduation is in feb 2027,btohqsg
all the best for the collection on 10 Jan,btohqsg
which courses are you looking to enter though? cus poly range for last year for l1r5 is not extremely low,btohqsg
no  there's prone to be oppt there as well,btohqsg
;( js that my math is terrible,btohqsg
do the teachers know the results already,btohqsg
let's keep our fingers crossed and await the results,btohqsg
no  the certs aren't sent in so early,btohqsg
its sent on the day itself rightt,btohqsg
10th jan my shift is like 10am to 7pm soo,btohqsg
likely they'll send the certs on the day itself or a day earlier but as you know  the teachers will have a summary or analytics of how their classes fared as a cohort,btohqsg
haha i didn't collect mine on the day itself tooig not collecting on the day itself means it will be left in the general office so all your teachers can discuss more about your results and gossip about it,btohqsg
my class is more like an NT class,btohqsg
who knows  they might have studied without your knowledge?,btohqsg
also like so many ppl had mental health issues during o level seasonn,btohqsg
If everyone does badly the bell curve helps you,btohqsg
*i suppose this helps everyone too cus all the cut-off points will increase and the range for everything increases even if there's no bell curve,btohqsg
that's how supply and demand work in general based on school placements,btohqsg
üòçü§û i just have no idea what to take if i go there,btohqsg
Rohit are u kurt tay lawyer,btohqsg
Girl came out of the spectator stands and threw a bombshell üíÄ,btohqsg
also Girl your book is upside down,btohqsg
You gotta wait like 6 to 7 weeks for it to appear,btohqsg

I also thought so but they won't know,btohqsg
Vape is for wannabes don't do it,btohqsg
Honestly  even though ppl do vaping in sg (p.s. quite illegal to vape btw),btohqsg
How's his performance as his personal TA,btohqsg
I gave a good rating for the survey thing :D,btohqsg
But results wise im only finding out in 12 hours,btohqsg
after all the effort i went through for him‚Ä¶,btohqsg
What makes you think i will do the TA feedback,btohqsg
Between a rock and a hard place lestin,btohqsg
I NEED to know my discrete math grade,btohqsg
