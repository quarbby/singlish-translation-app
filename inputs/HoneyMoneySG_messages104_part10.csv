Later tommorrow call bank.I never withdraw from this account so automatically average balance should increase month on month basis. If incoming funds are on same date everymonth.,btohqsg
Do you mean multiple 200 coins?,btohqsg
Means top up $200 cash  Shopee credits 200 coins.Then u withdraw back the $200.Can only do once as per TnC,btohqsg
Hi  any idea how does SC Smart Card calculates its point? i.e is there any rounding involved per transaction or per statement month. The TnC illustrative seems to show points are calculated per statement month but there‚Äôs no clear wordings on it,btohqsg
hi..happy labour day....my march MAB $101 717.79..i must put 50k + $1717.79 right?for the big savings promo 50k tier,btohqsg
Got my answer from live chat  this promo is only eligible for new user and not existing users regardless whether they've participated in Moneybull or not,btohqsg
Seems that uob has the best promo for cash = $150k,btohqsg
Is it worth to use cardup?,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check is it only me or did Foodpanda just removed most of the self pick up discounts??,btohqsg
How do i check via ocbc apps that i have met 500 mthly increment and payroll and that I meet the requirements to get the bonus interest ?,btohqsg
Nope.3.45% p.a. is just 3.4% p.a. from promo (above 500k) + 0.05% p.a. from base interest. 3.3% p.a. from promo if below 500k (total 3.35% p.a.).1% p.a. (max of $300) has always been under HSBC Everyday+ Rewards programme separate from the promo.Basically it's 4.1% (for 500k) or 4.35% p.a. (below 360k) for HSBC EGA now  including promo.,btohqsg
Have to check on website  app doesn't show,btohqsg
Weird. My wife account still have the discounts...,btohqsg
I think is the Dine In discount that has ended. Self pick up depends on merchant.,btohqsg
Now it‚Äôs time to bank run UOB bank since the interest rate has reduced,btohqsg
"if just approved (within few min/hours)- and online - activate (without received physical card yet) you can get in the SC App find your card there is ""Get CVV"" click and you will find it.",btohqsg
Hi gurus  i cancelled my cc last year April  if I apply today for cimb cc am I qualify for this promotion?,btohqsg
Should be  but I will cfm my doubt with their CS first before applying,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I got about $60k sitting in UOB One and understand that they are changing their interest rates from May onwards. I have OCBC 360 account too so not sure if it‚Äôs best to switch it back to OCBC or any other acc that is better? Thanks in advance üôèüèº,btohqsg
Does anyone know if use CIMB visa signature credit card pay for health hub payment does it consider approve spending in the mcc code?,btohqsg
Just give a quick call/message to CS to confirm before applying,btohqsg
My self pick up discounts are all missing. My wife's account still present. Anyone else faced similar issue as me?,btohqsg
As Mt mentioned previously  above $360K in HSBC EGA will not get the max effective additional 1% from Everyday+ rewards  may not be worth to pursue 500K tier (edit: law of diminishing returns since it is maxed out at 360K),btohqsg
OCBC may be the highest for now at 4.65% p.a. (edit: for $100K tier) if you fulfill the criterias  but how long will it last  nobody knows,btohqsg
For uob one acct  any min balance reqd to get the bonus interest for April if i transfer all out today and leave it zero balance?,btohqsg
For 60k it's actually only 3.8% p.a. if got salary  spend and save. Without save (following UOB requirements) it's 2.6% p.a.  so 3% from UOB One account is better if we don't include save criteria.If all criteria it's 6.2% p.a. but getting insurance or investing with them? ü§ÆHighest for under 75k would be HSBC EGA incremental funds promo and everyday+ rewards at 4.35% p.a.,btohqsg
Right  i missed the $60k. Was assuming $100K tier in my head,btohqsg
Anyone like me emptied uob one for this month? I will move my funds to ega for 4.35% and ocbc for 4.6%,btohqsg
I'm moving to HSBC EGA for the next 2 months as I won't be eligible for 4.6% p.a. on OCBC 360.I also suspect that they will announce the nerf of OCBC 360 this month.,btohqsg
Only worth to do it for 1 month... For the 2nd month.. Ur 1% bonus is based on increment from May ADB,btohqsg
EGA interest is slow .... its around 3 months late ? good things are worth the wait ba ....,btohqsg
If you read the t&c  earning period is for May and Jun  referencing to Mar ADB.,btohqsg
Aug  so technically only 2 months late for May  1 month late for Jun.Higher interest would still be better. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Unless they compound daily then it depends on how close the rates are.,btohqsg
