my FI is nice ah. But during water parade  other FIs legit damn crazy then my FI no choice must be liddat in front of other FIs also,btohqsg
they say cannot do more than 20 push ups in 1 go soo... the FIs don't make us do push ups but...they make us do push up hold with straight armsðŸ’€then everyone shaking and trembling bruh,btohqsg
I heard from cohort 1 (fail IPPT)  they said their water parade got hentak taki (the high knees) ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I only know the old punishment shift entire bunk down to parade square,btohqsg
but my FI quite chill by himself  we only kena called Mangkok twice so far,btohqsg
