if this isn't financially digging your own grave then surely throwing bank notes into a open fire is a great alternative,btohqsg
Excuse me  I troll what ??,btohqsg
I wished owning a car wasn‚Äôt that expensive üò≠,btohqsg
it wouldn't be if you had some common sense dipshit,btohqsg
When I ask I troll what  u ignore me like I don‚Äôt exist  all you do is just sit there and just happily warn me,btohqsg
1.7k monthly300 fuel (98  admittedly)$100 if you divide roadtax into a monthly basis,btohqsg
can‚Äôt be everything I say that needed me to be warned   do I need to repeat myself ?,btohqsg
and this is for a high spec non-COE E class.,btohqsg
and thats for a mercs eh,btohqsg
get your money up not your funny up,btohqsg
i must admit we only pump 98 because it's what any car deserves,btohqsg
For my case I suppose .,btohqsg
so you can shave off maybe $40-50 if you stick with 95,btohqsg
i change my rims and paint every two months,btohqsg
therefore it is very expensive to own a car,btohqsg
$2500 is alot of money  Im just going broke already .,btohqsg
U have no idea whatever I do,btohqsg
you should put it all on red,btohqsg
nah i would put it on 38,btohqsg
Don't think anyone is pissed at you for spending $2.5k per month on a mazda3,btohqsg
Not like that pay for it.,btohqsg
I never used anyone‚Äôs money either too,btohqsg
once again if you're shelling out 2.5k a month for a mazda 3,btohqsg
you could've gone and gotten a fucking 2018 530i with loads of room for mods,btohqsg
At most you will just be surprised  why will you be pissed that something u don‚Äôt have to worry about ?,btohqsg
this is the most i've laughed in a long while,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt Mazda well-liked by drivers for the steering especially??,btohqsg
2018 530i nowadays might be around 1.8-1.9 monthly300 for fuel and 100 for roadtax is very good imo,btohqsg
having driven a mazda 3 the steering feedback is absolutely dogshit,btohqsg
Then I will be complaining by now  but no my car steering feels just right as it is  no abnormalities (yet).,btohqsg
and how the dynamics of the road surface is transmitted,btohqsg
not abnormalities bro. Think he talking about general quality,btohqsg
the mazda 3 has numb ass steering,btohqsg
comparing it to a 2014 altis,btohqsg
the altis feels so much more well built and has significantly better road feel lol.,btohqsg
Then why would my other car friends use Mazda for their leisure drive when they have other better cars.,btohqsg
if its a to b fuck care whatever it is,btohqsg
You want a present ? üéÅ,btohqsg
i think ur friends arent ur friends if they tell u 2.5k for a mazda is ok,btohqsg
but you're saying a maz3 has better steering feel than a G30 5 series,btohqsg
I also got friend drive toyota everyday but got lambo at home leh. why not drive lambo everydayü§£,btohqsg
Of course it is not okay.,btohqsg
then why are you justifying 2.5k is ok,btohqsg
but better car according to your logic mah,btohqsg
i got car but i keep at carpark,btohqsg
call this number to voice your 2.5k monthly concerns,btohqsg
You want a best sticker award or an Oscar?,btohqsg
Being pissed at it is not gonna do anything about it.,btohqsg
who says we‚Äôre pissed at it,btohqsg
And they‚Äôll prolly scold u back for paying tht much üòÇ,btohqsg
Then you warn me for what reason?,btohqsg
Then say I pay $2.5k per month for Mazda is trolling .,btohqsg
why u so angry bro i thought u like trolling,btohqsg
How are u so sure I like trolling,btohqsg
You like jumping into conclusions  don‚Äôt you.,btohqsg
you like jumping into financial despair,btohqsg
But that isn‚Äôt your problem right if you‚Äôre not going to fix it for me.,btohqsg
no but you've made a great laughing stock of yourself today,btohqsg
my parents don‚Äôt have car but have Mazda 6,btohqsg
today's learning point is that paying 2.5k for a macan isn't as wise as paying 2.5k for a mazda 3,btohqsg
My parents Mazda 3 is like a present for them,btohqsg
then the mazda 6 come from where,btohqsg
but u say u buy mazda 3,btohqsg
so ur telling me ur mazda 6 is 3.5k monthly?,btohqsg
I have told you just now is 2.5k and not 3.5k monthly,btohqsg
but u said mazda 3 is 2.5k,btohqsg
/ warn like wants to come out already,btohqsg
me when asked about the babies at the maternity ward,btohqsg
rabbid do u paint ur car monthly or bimonthly?,btohqsg
for me i do it weekly,btohqsg
issok just carbon fibre your schlong,btohqsg
bro kena caught lying then disappear alr,btohqsg
I never mentioned the number .,btohqsg
cannot   it needs to stay dense and heavy and big,btohqsg
Urgh  how can I messed up my Mazda 3 with my 6.,btohqsg
Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt buy too many Mazdas,btohqsg
That can u suggest me a nice car,btohqsg
2018 BMW 530i 1.8/m2018 Mercedes-Benz E200 1.7/m2017 Macan 2.5/m,btohqsg
Is it cheaper than what I‚Äôm paying now,btohqsg

shall i do the final thing,btohqsg
inshallah you‚Äôll spend money on the fucking financial literacy course,btohqsg
I think you the best literacy Cher,btohqsg
