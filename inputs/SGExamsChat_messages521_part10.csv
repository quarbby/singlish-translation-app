When I was younger I lick the tip of things too,btohqsg
Erasers  highlighters (coloured my tongue)  chewed on pencil lead,btohqsg
okay the last one reminds me of something,btohqsg
At least u didn't chew on pencil *LEAD*,btohqsg
there was this trend in my primary school where kids would eat mechanical pencil lead,btohqsg
like straight up swallow that shit,btohqsg
I had a kid in primary school who had this one GAG he would do to get attention,btohqsg
then my sister did it and then i wanted to commit suicide,btohqsg
So he would when prompted take off his shoe and lick the soles clean,btohqsg
tbf again it’s such a small sample,btohqsg
but uh immediately pulled emergency shower,btohqsg
Talking bout this my friend did that once thinking it did not work,btohqsg
damn that must've been an insane event,btohqsg
why would he think it didn’t work,btohqsg
Because a lot of things in my school that should work “safety” don’t work,btohqsg
Imagine if it wasn't maintained for 1 year plus.. the first 1 minute of the water flowing would be fully grey,btohqsg
Half the classroom doors can be opened without a key,btohqsg
No like things that take into consideration the “safety” of students,btohqsg
i think the one in my faculty gets monthly checks thankfully,btohqsg
