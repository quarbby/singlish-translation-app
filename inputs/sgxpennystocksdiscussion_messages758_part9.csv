Why this morning SMM dropped so much ? Any bad news before Egm 16 Feb ?,btohqsg
So far past 1-2wks above news🗞️ or FA sharing r positive.. can anyone shared your SCM⛴ FA opinion?I only looks at TA📈 and working on Wilmar🌴 TA📈 now.. b4 shared my opinion in SCM⛴ in TA📈,btohqsg
U mean gov medisheld life or upgrade ones under private insurers,btohqsg
Generally  medisheld life + personal medisave will be able to cover the class c  without the need to come out cash. B2 not too sure.,btohqsg
I suggest may looks at Commodities stks.. after sudden strong dump dn last Thurs & Fri.. most commodity appeared a morning⭐star yesterday and raised a bit this morning.. tbc next 1-3 trading days🤣,btohqsg
I mean the Govt MediShield life for class c/b2 wards. Thanks,btohqsg
If without personal Medisave  can cover?,btohqsg
Sure won't cover all....if not why private insurers come in,btohqsg
It discount your baker hughes but doesn’t mean it less superior.,btohqsg
If really have to be admitted to govt hospital  no point choosing B2 over C. Don't see much different  but price difference quite a bit.,btohqsg
Now Pte ins also must pay when admit. Is MediShield life good enough for b2/c?,btohqsg
Won't cover all expenses.... probably 60 to 70% for C. B2 less. U can always ask the hospital for estimated charges,btohqsg
