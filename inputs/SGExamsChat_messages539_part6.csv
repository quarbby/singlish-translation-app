the other ambulance crew came back and then saw me outside and they were in shock,btohqsg
and i told them the situation of what happened  and i went inside,btohqsg
the other ambulance crew A122 (im A123) abt 10min later went for call,btohqsg
no lah dei i paid for it alr,btohqsg
and then i went to sleep (got nothing better to do),btohqsg
then all of a sudden A123 got call  i woke up and saw the FP void of people,btohqsg
i checked outside to see if A123 was outside but it wasn't  so i realised they didn't even return to base and they got called,btohqsg
AND THE STORY DOESN'T END THERE,btohqsg
30min later  i see my snr medic call me like 2 times to ask me to collect his food  but me being the idiot i am went outside and closed the door  only to realise i didn't have key and the door auto locks,btohqsg
so once i went out and took the food and returned,btohqsg
when i went to SGH to send patient  A122 sent another patient at ard same time  turns out he was a cbt medic,btohqsg
if only we took that call sia,btohqsg
how can i compete with the great bedok,btohqsg

Dear (whoever) intro who you are and what’s the email for. then like attached is my writeup etc. Thank you.Best regards your name,btohqsg

All my homies hate situational writing,btohqsg
I cant think of a singular more useless thing in sg curriculum,btohqsg
Character and citizenship education in primary school  it’s “form teacher time” in sec school,btohqsg
I mean that is a virtual signalling for govt,btohqsg
"But situation writing is touted as a ""functional skill"" but fails to do that",btohqsg
When the teacher is not even required to be in class tho,btohqsg
Might as well go home better,btohqsg
Its not abt u the student  its abt the govt saying look we care abt ethics in education during external audit,btohqsg
He can help u unpack what NS has done to u,btohqsg
The new curriculum has Ft time,btohqsg
situational writing is an actual examinable component that’s so far from what people use irl,btohqsg
