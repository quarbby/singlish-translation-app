first 2 numbers is the week of the year.,btohqsg
eg. 2021 means week 20 of 2021,btohqsg
As in the ws only say made in yr 2021,btohqsg
But TUV and ISO certification is not easy to get. They will audit your entire process also. Not just the wheel quality itself.,btohqsg
Like some food manufacturing company they also got ISO certification. They also dont test the food itself,btohqsg
agreed. not sure for TUV but ISO depends which regulation is being certified. it could be safety  environmental  manufacturing processes etc.,btohqsg
so it's good to see which standard they are certified with,btohqsg
So they have ISO doesnt mean the entire company have ISO?,btohqsg
like for my company we mainly focus on ISO9001 (documentation) and ISO45001 (safety compliance).,btohqsg
means on which aspect is being certified,btohqsg
there are many standards of ISO to cover the many aspects of a company.,btohqsg
you can go dig into it. there's a lot haha. i only sharing what i know because have to deal w the auditors,btohqsg
So for SSW it looks like it is design and manufacturing,btohqsg
ya so for 9001 they check for how quality is ensured and controlled,btohqsg
even for machinery whether they have regular inspection or servicing records etc.,btohqsg
Thats just saving a penny to lose a pound later,btohqsg
Like using cheap engine oil and then see white smoke from your performance car,btohqsg
So does it still mean the quality of the wheel will be good?,btohqsg
tbh i dont think so. HAHA,btohqsg
Not really although it gives u some degree of confidence in the company,btohqsg
Ultimately whether a brand makes sure their wheels hold up  its their reputation on the line,btohqsg
Rep makers have no such worry,btohqsg
They only need the outside to look the same,btohqsg
They can use cast iron and u wont know,btohqsg
It think really goes from brand to brand ba,btohqsg
If you're a branded rep maker trying to make it big in the future  reputation definitely on the line.,btohqsg
Compared to those brandless rep maker,btohqsg
like  even if they send to independent testing facility  it may only just be that one good set that they send.,btohqsg
Compared to AL tyres reps u dont even know the rims come from where,btohqsg
Ssw is a rep maker? Arent they an independent brand?,btohqsg
unless they have to regularly report their qc to someone else. maybe a manufacturer or something.,btohqsg
My TE37 is made by them,btohqsg
i did enquire before  like 900+ per set iirc,btohqsg
i can see it on my car too,btohqsg
Even Rota is an independant brand ma,btohqsg
Those arent really replicas but more like ssw copy their design?,btohqsg
Do they market it as te37?,btohqsg
they have their own model name,btohqsg
Then its not strictly a replica,btohqsg
But you can tell ma  it's a TE37 rep,btohqsg
So your replica is really those unknown brand la,btohqsg
Yea but put it this way  its like samsung makes a phone and outward appearance is iphone,btohqsg
Meaning its sold as te37 and marketed as such and has no brand behind it,btohqsg
Because obviously it would be illegal,btohqsg
Ok i get what you mean,btohqsg
So you feel that branded copies marketted as similar design is ok,btohqsg
Yea i never thought about lookalikes this way,btohqsg
but those brandless market as TE37 is not,btohqsg
Since they dont tia the sticker or market it as such,btohqsg
or rather they used to la,btohqsg
