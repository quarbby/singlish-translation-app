But it’s normal for used car to have perfume . Previous owner preference mah. But those heavily scented to me is a red flag,btohqsg
@danquroslike I mentioned earlier  join that car model's chat group and do research to understand more.,btohqsg
My priorities  get the car's 'health' in order before zng. 😁😁,btohqsg
Hope@danquros's excitement is not dampered by us 😂😂,btohqsg
Heh. Zhng usually is body paint or wrap. Leather change.,btohqsg

It’s like buy new house. U will change the toilet bowl 😂,btohqsg
Heh. So many things to do,btohqsg
First time car buyer or new drivers  personal feel is buy used and not over exoctic or powerful. Move up from there after gain driving and ownership experience,btohqsg
Friends asked me  why buy a 12 year old car and spend $$$$ by adding soundproofing  braces and replacing wear & tear stuff...etc? Why not just buy a new car?My answer to them  it's called love n passion. 😁😁😁😁,btohqsg
Suddenly i thinking how come buy new hse need change toilet bowl LOL,btohqsg
Ya Man. It’s a clean and healthy hobby. Though it does take use some dollars,btohqsg
"Then my question to my friends  ""Do you grow old with your wives (spend $$$ on skin care) or change a younger one?""",btohqsg
HAHAHAH! Eh have people change to younger ones lea,btohqsg
Camry still good to used even more than 10yrs. Less problem,btohqsg
Ya. For those without a right frame of mind. My point of view. 😅😅😅😅,btohqsg
OK lah sometimes things happens for a reason same as car. HAHAHA,btohqsg
Only for the older cars   now new jap cars lot of electronic failure also,btohqsg
Why is mazda 3 ur least fav… which year model is it,btohqsg

Really ah. Can see Toyota still top sales in new car registration. Mind set hard to change I guess,btohqsg
Ya. I am at United sq. The security guard just let every one in. I guess there issnt too much meaning to it anymore,btohqsg
Wa. Your car? I got a friend who sold this.  Reason is too fast 😝,btohqsg
Haha. No. Not my car. I wish,btohqsg
447k? More exp then a BMW Ix,btohqsg
Singapore it’s the other way round,btohqsg
Malaysia Ix I think 360 or 370k rm,btohqsg
Malaysian ringgit. Now ringgit is down big. Nearly 320 now,btohqsg
That’s not good car. Just the brand. You want high tech it’s Tesla.,btohqsg
Lol. Too late. My car is ix,btohqsg
447 is top of the line Tesla 3 performance,btohqsg
Model 3 top of the line SG still under 300k I think,btohqsg

Ya it's a matter of hours anyway.,btohqsg
Can use chill mode reduce horse power and torque by 60%,btohqsg
I say it’s because itchy backside want to change,btohqsg
But selling tesla earn money anyway,btohqsg
As price keep increase due to over demand,btohqsg
bad idea unless you want a boring machine. why not look at used mazda 6? cheaper and more fun,btohqsg
But to me fast is good overtaking car and change lane to easy,btohqsg
Different car fits different need 🤭 no fix formula,btohqsg
can sgcarmart improve the search engine? it is quite frustrating when a simple search like this yields no results,btohqsg
Especially against road hogger over taking them is with ease,btohqsg
at least m ake it intelligent.,btohqsg
Or those deliberately speed up when you want change lane,btohqsg
If u put Camry 2016…. Maybe there might be results given it’s 丰田,btohqsg
sorry t say sgcarmart search is lousy,btohqsg
shoud allow powerful flexible searches. even the malaysian mudah lets you do that,btohqsg
