hii for chem pract rgt  when u wanna record timing in seconds is it nearest second  1 dp or 2 dp?,btohqsg
No one cares bout dp cuz of human reaction time,btohqsg
Unless you tell me you flash or smt then sure,btohqsg
if its quick reactions then its 1dp. if its long reactions  then its nearest second,btohqsg
They give the first 0. smt if you need record time,btohqsg
Include 0s in your table or smt,btohqsg
No way they’ll ask for 2dp,btohqsg
so who's up for going to sch and destroying the chem lab early tmr?,btohqsg
How does one let one sibling leave one's rook,btohqsg
My sis camping in my room,btohqsg
I see. Take out fake cockroach,btohqsg
I’ve never seen girls not afraid of cockroaches,btohqsg
Atb to your chem practical tmr,btohqsg
is anyone here afraid of getting screwed over by emaths/amats moderation :’),btohqsg
Yah i scared i kena F9 for both,btohqsg
I take that Ur telling my sis instead,btohqsg
u guys will be finefor emath it will be challenging to get A's   most fall within B3for amath pray to bellcurve gods,btohqsg
Don't worry too much...national distinction rate for both maths is about 55% for express stream students. National pass rate in 2017 is 93.3% for E Math  95.2% for A Math,btohqsg
"Hi everyone  can you guys help give me a letter grade (A+  B-  etc) for this introduction? I'm struggling to pass but I've been working on introductions. Would really appreciate the feedback. TIA! ^_^Question: ""Can fear be good?"" Discuss.For many people  whenever the word ‘fear’ is mentioned  they would think of something supernatural that they are scared of. Most would think that fear is bad. They may think that way because fear makes them open to people’s judgement or criticism. However  fear can be positive. The positivity of fear can help a person to progress and grow into someone better.",btohqsg
that's a very big assumption in the first sentence,btohqsg
Oh. Thanks for your reply. Could you share how I could improve it?,btohqsg
dont associate fear with supernatural immediately,btohqsg
because most people don’t necessarily think of the supernatural,btohqsg
I see. What's a better association?,btohqsg
you could improve it by just associating it with the idea of being scared,btohqsg
or you could do a rhetoric,btohqsg
asking the reader what their fears are,btohqsg
and then elaborating on your own,btohqsg
then u could go into the general idea of fear,btohqsg
Wow thanks! Can I check if you mean this would be in the introduction or do you mean in the body?,btohqsg
i think the introduction should mainly be your thesis/stance + a hook if you wish  but i think what fear means to you/what fear is defined as should also be in the introduction  but briefly  since the question is whether fear can be good,btohqsg
Right... I get it now. Thanks for your time and help! ^_^,btohqsg
Btw those taking chem prac today   jiayouuu!!,btohqsg
No one storming the labs yet?,btohqsg
All the best to people who are taking Chemistry practical today!!!,btohqsg
Hi guys how was chem practical? Anyone drank kopi o?,btohqsg
I forgot to tell you guys something,btohqsg
Idk which is the instrument that you put a red blob on it,btohqsg
I think your chem teacher told you to hit the tip of the pipette against the beaker or sth to extract the last drop of liquid in the pipette,btohqsg
