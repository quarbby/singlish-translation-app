google translate is my best friend for chinese,btohqsg
I guess now need to focus on O levels,btohqsg
This year actually easier because they don't give ridiculous setups. But it's tougher because of the s.f conversions / SI units. Mess up once and ur graph will not cooperate,btohqsg
Idk it's really hard to focus,btohqsg
i failed my math exam today,btohqsg
id say a motor and a twistie string set up is pretty ridiculous,btohqsg
me failing is a meme la yes,btohqsg
but the motor sibei noisy eh,btohqsg
I spent a few mins playing with it,btohqsg
i was like huh y so loud,btohqsg
Perhaps that's why I couldn't finish the first part ah,btohqsg
I accidentally touched the resistor luckily my hands were dry,btohqsg
my friend sprayed disinfectant in my eye when wiping down,btohqsg
How many drew a curve instead of a line,btohqsg
they ask for gradient without any value of x,btohqsg
They literally told u in the qn its a line,btohqsg
I think they talking about the planning,btohqsg
I drew a line but quite a few people drew a curve,btohqsg
I love how my L1R5 is so limited becus of prac now,btohqsg
The qn said calculate the gradient of the LINE,btohqsg
no mass how to have gpe,btohqsg
i drew a line for planning,btohqsg
ur W 0 then P also 0,btohqsg
HAHAHA i dont intend to count physics so idc tbh,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure no one drew curve for planning,btohqsg
my physics theory is the worst,btohqsg
I genuinely think I'm gonna do worse than prelims,btohqsg
my practical is better idk why,btohqsg
yeah i failed all the way till prelims,btohqsg
Same I've not done a single practice paper before the prelims,btohqsg
Ah I'm more scared for chem,btohqsg
If I screw up chem L1R5 die already,btohqsg
i imagine its some dumbass prac weve never done before,btohqsg
chem wldnt be that far off,btohqsg
Pencil case on fire agn ðŸ”¥,btohqsg
Im aiming for A1 so wtf,btohqsg
im aiming for A1 for mostly everyt tbh,btohqsg
Fml I'm prob gonna do worse for o levels than prelims,btohqsg
U got like 3 A1s no?,btohqsg
but phy at this state idk,btohqsg
I got 3 As but theyre okay ish,btohqsg
Ye but everyone says by os will improve,btohqsg
If u come up on the news as the top student i wont be surprised,btohqsg
i dont wanna believe in tt yet ba,btohqsg
Oh I thot u got A1 for everything. I wanted to ask u to tutor me,btohqsg
Did anyone teacher tried to spot the qn on chem prac,btohqsg
ðŸ˜’ We were in physics lab,btohqsg
Chem lab is on different level,btohqsg
Bruh my gradient is like 0.something,btohqsg
Graph supposed to start frm origin right?,btohqsg
