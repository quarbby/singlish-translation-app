Suggestions for card replacement for HSBC Revo  without monthly limitations,btohqsg
Can try appeal with uob to make up spending for Apr statement. If not can only clock spend for May and Jun statement to get 2/3 of quarterly rebate. Can change statement date to be closer to end of calendar month but too late to change to affect Apr statement spending le.,btohqsg

Hello! Can I check if Cardup transactions (For insurance payments) can fulfil the qualifying spend for the Amex Platinum Charge card? üôè Appreciate any help thanks!,btohqsg
Quick clarification  I see that there‚Äôs no SIA listed. So this means that I can‚Äôt transfer miles to SIA/Kris or am I missing something?,btohqsg
Short answer is No.Long explanation: I will let the CEO@joeluxizhihandle this question,btohqsg
Hospital bills definitely under MCCs.. But do all clinics also definitely fall under MCCs? And how about spacio wellness TCM? Anyone has any experience or idea? I looked around online and cant find a confirmed answer to these...,btohqsg
As suggested by Trazora sis  the first quarter  Uob is more lenient. If u miss the first month it‚Äôs ok. Just make sure second month onwards u don‚Äôt fall below your targeted tier.Do not change statement cycle dates unless u willing to sit out one quarter. Many dps that the quarterly cash back messes up when u change statement date  eg u have one missing month.,btohqsg
So far clinics are not excluded. The only excluded one by most cards is 8062.When unsure always use amaze + empty wallet to test. U scared embarrassed more or scared 0 cash back more. Your choice. No right no wrong.,btohqsg
Clinics within public hospitals shall be 8062.Have you searched Heymax for Spacio mcc code? I can find its mcc code in Heymax.,btohqsg
Hi I would like to check if gym membership( deduct monthly ) is eligible in $500 spent for UOB ONE Saving account ?,btohqsg
should be eligible assuming mcc is not excluded,btohqsg
Clinics under parkway not within public hospital.. Seems i need to learn what is amaze and empty wallet.. All along only use physical credit cards.. Damn old school,btohqsg
Means use amaze card linked to wallet with very small balance. So whatever u try to pay will fail and u can see the mcc of the failed transaction.Do not lock anything.,btohqsg
"What is amaze card? Where to apply? Every visa master and amex have its own amaze version that can link to wallet? And how to link to wallet? I have only used physical cards so far.. Digital stuffs ""scare"" me.. But seems have to learn n keep up with times liao especially now semi retire got more time le..",btohqsg
Download the app  and apply through it.The app should be call Instarem,btohqsg

What is the best single card for high spenders?,btohqsg
Yeah I reached out to the customer service yesterday and managed to get the cash coupon but truly gaslighting me in their response - told me that they have credited the rest of the benefits into my account but I was specifically asking for the $80 cash coupon üò§ (had to tell them 3 times in a row before it got credited into my account),btohqsg
Hey  thanks for the Q  the Krisflyer miles redemption is something in the works right now. Appreciate your patience.Right now you can instantly redeem Singapore Airlines flight by transferring my Max Miles to Air Canada Aeroplan  Thai Airways  Turkish  United Airlines or Alaska and book on Singapore Airline flight.,btohqsg
Same  I lost track which challenge was that already but it says there during the month of jan,btohqsg
Likely no one card fits all categories optimally if u want a ‚Äúbest‚Äù card.But if must really force one in my opinion  these are some recommendations:1. Citi cashback+ for 1.6% cashback2. Uob absolute Amex for 1.7% cashback3. Uob prvi master/visa/amex for 1.4mpd,btohqsg
Tnx for the clarification! Looking forward to seeing SIA included in the list!,btohqsg
Oo  4k get 240. Not bad..haha,btohqsg
"If buy ntuc online using heymax/favepay  Mcc is 5311. Which means I should select ""fashion"" for my uob ladys card right? Assuming if deposit 10k in uob ladys  I should get 6mpd from uob lady and 2.75mpd from Heymax  am I right? Total 8.75mpd",btohqsg
Holding period 1 month. Although I heard got people terminate early but not sure if they still received.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need video actually. Although YouTube may have if u search.TLDR: go to the rewards portal of your credit cards. Transfer to the same named krisflyer account. Almost all Singapore credit cards that earn miles should be able to transfer to krisflyer. I don‚Äôt know any that can‚Äôt but I‚Äôm saying almost all in case some sniper comes out and say I lie: bank xxx cannot.,btohqsg
Does freelook actually kick in for snack and the rewards? I heard no but I didn‚Äôt try. I played safe and held over 15 days + whatever the specific minimum period. It was a positive gain on the ILP anyway. We lucky.,btohqsg
Honestly I got no idea why I got it also haha,btohqsg

How does the miles game work? Can I trf miles from Citi to krisflyer  and then trf miles from UOB to krisflyer then all these miles can combine to buy 1 ticket?,btohqsg

Assuming monthly loan repayment is 3000  can i do this:- 1000 using CPF- 1000 using CardUp- 1000 debit from my bank accountI just need to schedule CardUp a few days before the date that other 2 modes are triggered  right?,btohqsg
If use uob one card to pay at shopee or Lazada  is it counted as the $500 spending?,btohqsg

So no need to link the uob card to Google pay or simply go to be eligible?,btohqsg
