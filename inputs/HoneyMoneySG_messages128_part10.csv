Should it make sense to clear out the UOB one account by end august. So Sep clear out 1 month for the q4 promotion?,btohqsg
I think the one month new funds definition was fake.Those who moved out on 1st July also got successfully earmarked in august right,btohqsg
Yea I am expecting they will have saving promotion on uob one by the incremental vs Sep average daily balance for Oct Nov and Dec accordingly. As they did vs June for July Aug Sep.,btohqsg
With the 2 or 3 interest rate cut expected in the 4th quarter  banks may start to review their promotions if it is still sustainable. Let enjoy while it last,btohqsg
Yeah my strategy was I locked in as many as I could this round already. Including into scb save up level up.,btohqsg
Yea to clear out uob one moving to hsbc ega and actually without the saving promotion it don't max out the uob one account,btohqsg
