So if i had a portable monitor,btohqsg
I dont have to care any more,btohqsg
By right as long tv has HDMI you should be good to go,btohqsg
Yes but some for mysterious reasons,btohqsg
What I learnt is the power adapter and cable is important,btohqsg
Or all the ports used up and cable tied in,btohqsg
Die die it needs a USB A to USB C cable.,btohqsg
Or the tv is hard mounted u cant reach the ports or even see them,btohqsg
USB C to USB C doesn't work,btohqsg
USB C to USB C doesn't work,btohqsg
Actually there's another method can try  sounds quite stupid but use a laptop as the monitor.,btohqsg
There will probably be input lag if done that way.Switch HDMI - USB capture card - laptop,btohqsg
