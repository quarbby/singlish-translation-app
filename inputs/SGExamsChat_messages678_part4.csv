you're supposed to get rid of the x now,btohqsg
because times x to both x and 2,btohqsg
ok correctionyou want to get rid of anything thats greater or equal to the highest polynomial of the denominator,btohqsg
I want the -4x-3 to be gone also,btohqsg
Let's denote the highest degree of the denominator as H  and the highest degree of numerator as J  we want to make sure that long division helps to simplify the fraction  such that J < H,btohqsg
Ok then u see u still left with -4x-3 right?,btohqsg
if J >= H <=> improper fraction,btohqsg
U have found the one who resulted in 1.3k messages,btohqsg
get rid of the -4x now,btohqsg
How to get rid of the -4x?,btohqsg
Repeat the process again like how u get rid of xsquare,btohqsg
If u know the previous step u can do the second step,btohqsg
its kinda a recursion until highest degree of polynomial is lower,btohqsg
Wait r u just asking why need to divide again,btohqsg
yeah  until the dividend has a lower degree than the thing you're doing with,btohqsg
IDK HOW TO DO LONY DIVISION,btohqsg
Wah this is why we don't need more children in the world,btohqsg
WHY N6 FRIEND WRITE NEGATIVE 4,btohqsg
you have x+3but you are diving with x²then cannot divide further alr,btohqsg
lol n u still dont agree that im stupid,btohqsg
-4 times x+2 u get what?,btohqsg
you're not stupid you just need help,btohqsg
im sorry florals idw to be mean but theres a limit,btohqsg
where she get the negative 4 on top,btohqsg
bruh my bus the aircorn. is hot air cmg out,btohqsg
Then u can get rid of the 4x in the remainder liao mah,btohqsg
Then u get a number as remainder,btohqsg
That’s the simplest form for remainder liao,btohqsg
bro even the bus is sweating,btohqsg
why got beg tive 4 on top,btohqsg
U see why there's 1.3k messages,btohqsg
"Any attempt at helping she follows up with ""I'm stupid""",btohqsg
Not u creating a sticker of what vem says,btohqsg
just dont write inside the equation,btohqsg
there's a reason i left to do my own work lol,btohqsg
like i understand the first one  then - 4x - 3 that one ik bc -2x minus 2x,btohqsg
Yea u must get rid of X in the remainder,btohqsg
So just repeat the process to long divide again(like how u get rid of Xsquare,btohqsg
then she just write the times 4 for - 3 ah,btohqsg
Then u removed the -4x already,btohqsg
I actually dk what the 0/1/3 is,btohqsg
pls no. i tried b4 and chat gpt give wrong answer,btohqsg
i think is best u ask ur cher or smtg,btohqsg
idk who my math cher is,btohqsg
i asked a yijcian but he nvr answer,btohqsg
sigh  bro doesn't understand long division,btohqsg
florals gl in learning binomial theorem,btohqsg
I can do the qns at home but rn im walking,btohqsg
i askijg my parents n teachers,btohqsg
then u guys say uw to kill urself. or something,btohqsg
