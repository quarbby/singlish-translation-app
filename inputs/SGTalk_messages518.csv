I thought you keeping options open  ask like you interested,btohqsg

Age is not an issue when comes to love,btohqsg
I ask so u can see if he is suitable for u or not,btohqsg
Oh with girls I don't know how he act. I am saying with us.He can deadlift 150kg. I barely can lift 100,btohqsg
This is how villains are made ü§£,btohqsg

Come follow me train i assure you become SSFA,btohqsg

Sometimes it‚Äôs good to help. Really appreciate friends like u. But he needs to be on his own once he is in any group. So whether he is nice or not will depend on how he interacts with others etc‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Like the way u said it!,btohqsg
He gave up dating apps already. I ask him what he wants to do. He say just let it be. But as a kpo old man  I worried for him. As he is only 30s for so long.,btohqsg

if you observe close enough can see de,btohqsg
Some people is good at covering up de,btohqsg

The head creates logical reasons to support what the heart wants,btohqsg
My under age single secondary niece xmm would love to go. You keen to sponsor her?,btohqsg
I know the feeling and the process again‚Ä¶really don‚Äôt want to go through that anymore. That‚Äôs why some of my single friends rather be single,btohqsg

cause his taste is those kpop girls,btohqsg
Wait until date 2 then dig nose la,btohqsg
i know lol but I mean its his interest who am I to say anything lol,btohqsg
I have few gfs also single. Â•≥Âº∫‰∫∫,btohqsg
interest in kpop girls doesn‚Äôt mean gf also need same kind ma,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why unless we vibe or have chemistry I ok but the try try then maybe will fall in love later kind of setting no ty lol,btohqsg
Join here to learn how to generate chemistry with anyone,btohqsg

Tasha and ferlyn say hi also üòÇ,btohqsg
I have a friend I dunno he got made it or not though but he like got albums all those Liao but dun seem very famous kind in Korea,btohqsg
Give him few more years he will come back,btohqsg
Indeed but I mean he still has the right to fantasize I guess,btohqsg
He has the courage to dream big üëç,btohqsg
oh he been doing it for abt at least 15 years le,btohqsg
Recently saw he got some concert poster or something then I remember him,btohqsg
End up marrying someone who is not same type also.,btohqsg
i see him wear the belt i fell in love üòç,btohqsg
he good looking also that‚Äôs why,btohqsg
I have to support a man who knows what he wants and goes ahead to get it  no matter how impossible it is,btohqsg
I mean as long as he got money to survive ü§∑,btohqsg
marry always is not their dream type one. life.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt tell me is Nat Ho,btohqsg
Marry the one that love u  not the one u love ü§≠,btohqsg
Depends on what they want. If i don‚Äôt meet my current bf  i think i will also end up being single forever liao.,btohqsg
But then you married Liao then you meet the one you love ‚Ä¶ how,btohqsg
I remember Liao I tag you again ü§£,btohqsg
oh and also what happened to dps,btohqsg
Actually not difficult to find someone who loves you. The difficulty is to love them back,btohqsg
Most guys de words cant trust,btohqsg
Will ask him if he is keen to join this group,btohqsg
Usually the person who loves you  you don‚Äôt love them,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs not only that  it‚Äôs often when you refused to accept when you know they Lie,btohqsg
Then u will always be on the loosing end,btohqsg
tell him we will help him become a changed man !,btohqsg
Yes lo!! Always sweet talk me till i so confused which is the real him,btohqsg
But u enjoy his sweet talk ba?,btohqsg
Also  you can never forget your first love.,btohqsg
you should be able to see all the red flags Liao de but you wish it wasn‚Äôt true so you blind yourself,btohqsg
how could you forget me üò¢,btohqsg
Choose the second one. Because if you really loved the first one  you wouldn't have fallen for the second. üòÇü§£,btohqsg
i les you don‚Äôt ÁäØË¥± still like me,btohqsg
There is some truth in this.,btohqsg
ok la life is short like oppa said  anything anyone that you are happy with  go for it  no one can judge you only you can ü§∑,btohqsg
Now become next liao . Game over,btohqsg
but hopefully the second one loves you too if not when she meets someone she loves  it‚Äôs just history repeats üò¢,btohqsg
Nvm la wait for the next one!,btohqsg
But sometimes the appearances of 2nd one will make u realise how much u love the 1st one. U know how others cannot replace 1st one,btohqsg
Just saying. 40+ % of marriage ends in divorce. It's actually easy to get together. But it's really hard to stay together,btohqsg
it‚Äôs ok  I mean if you meet the someone you like  even if in the end didn‚Äôt turn out well  at least you been there done that so no regrets !,btohqsg
And many already drop out at the get together stage,btohqsg
Falling is easy but maintaining is not easy at all!,btohqsg
I read a studies on couples that manage to stay together for decades. they discovered these people have 2 traits.,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why dun think too complex  fall first see how later,btohqsg
You can go with mr ÁäØË¥±,btohqsg
Stay tgt.. see all the bad habits come out then decide want to marry or not lol,btohqsg
unless you are married or attached that one think twice lol,btohqsg
1. They are complete independent happy people to start with.They don't need another human or a marriage to complete their life and be happy.,btohqsg
Nowadays people cannot tahan long. Got problem  want to siam already. Not willing to sit down and talk over it with u.,btohqsg
Marriage is just a bonus in their life. Èî¶‰∏äÊ∑ªËä±,btohqsg
Then why you go singles event üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
lies ! You never eat full !!,btohqsg
Last time i asked my gf‚Äôs bf why they don‚Äôt want to be married. They were tgt for 10 years. He told me why change status when both of them are happy now? Almost 20 years later i understand his words.,btohqsg
2. They are people who will sit down and solve problem together with their partner. They don't push blames and don't get agitated easily. Happy and calm and willing to work together at the first sign of problem.,btohqsg
what is buffet without eating full,btohqsg
Actually its xmas event to knw more frds de,btohqsg
This one takes a high level of maturity for both parties,btohqsg
but to be fair it was quite nice la,btohqsg
I been to a few of their outing. Got volunteery work de also,btohqsg
The dreaded CNY and then quickly followed by Feb.,btohqsg
Hmm i agreed with what the article said.,btohqsg
Psychologists state that if you use to be fair at the start of the sentence  it's not really true,btohqsg
it‚Äôs ok dun matter what eventGot pretty girls jiu ok Liao ! ü§£,btohqsg
Never get attached before valentines day,btohqsg

Correction.. Nv get attached before valentine day  Christmas and her bday,btohqsg
Smh lol but ok la reasonable request!,btohqsg
what is pretty girls without taking contact number?,btohqsg
Which horoscope is the most safe,btohqsg

Paiseh yest didn't take your number,btohqsg
Marriage is just to officialized it  especially if there's kids involved.Even then  in Switzerland  I met a lady  who intro her bf to me and then their 20+ SUPER handsome son.So I guess we still can be more liberal,btohqsg
cause i not pretty. it‚Äôs okay,btohqsg
Haha cny leh? Tag along got angbao take leh,btohqsg
Virgo scariest easiest and hardest to love,btohqsg
I thought if I didn't take then you will ÁäØË¥± and give me but it backfired,btohqsg
Then become one such person and look for such a person if you want ÈïøÈïø‰πÖ‰πÖ,btohqsg
Virgo easiest to fall in love but also once fallen out of love they are the coldest,btohqsg
But im a cusp virgo libra,btohqsg

No leh. Scorpio will hide things n betray people.,btohqsg
Some girls feel pressured to be single on vday and just anyhow accept. Then the feeling wears off and the problem come,btohqsg
I blur queen lai de. I sure forget,btohqsg
Aiya horoscopes don‚Äôt speak for everyone,btohqsg
Which one most lihai in bed,btohqsg

I know someone who puts his love ones before him,btohqsg
The one that do a lot of abs exercise  maybe,btohqsg
