Hi  I‚Äôm thinking to invest using CPF-OA and looking at Amundi Prime. Not sure is a good time seeing the dip?,btohqsg
Anyone received their physical chocolate finance card? I applied the day it was released and till now did not receive it...,btohqsg
Oh that's quite long. I applied on 5 Feb and got it on 25 Feb.,btohqsg
I applied on 10 Feb and still haven't received also :(,btohqsg
Was going to bring to japan end of this month.. dunno if can get it before my trip alr üòï,btohqsg
I have been waiting for weeks but still not received yet ü§î,btohqsg
Paywave or card insert. Some places in Japan don't have apple pay/google pay,btohqsg
same here...i've been waiting for the past 1mth!,btohqsg
it seemed that Chocolate Finance cant cope with the overwhelming request for the physical card? this will cause a detrimental image for them?,btohqsg
the card cannot add to samsung pay,btohqsg
I have received.  I have link with hey max too  do I need to pay thru hey max  or I can just use the card . It will record down the transaction?,btohqsg
What is the use case of physical chocolate card if already using tagging it with Apple Pay / Google pay?Initially  I thought physical chocolate card can be used to tap bus/mrt.. but understand that is not possible.,btohqsg
"ü§£ü§£ waiting for the next time someone asks  ""is chocolate finance app down?""",btohqsg
For places that don't accept Apple/Google Pay but still accepts physical card contactless?,btohqsg
Yes  last time I tried amaze on Google pay cannot. But tap physical card ok  that's why I wanted to bring the physical chocolate card over,btohqsg
Why need physical card  when u can save it on Google pay or etc.. The card info is on the app anyway.,btohqsg
some places overseas dun allow google pay,btohqsg
Some countries don't have widespread acceptance of mobile contactless e.g. Japan,btohqsg
I see.. I meant more for payment online or locally.. I wouldn't use this card for overseas as it is still a debit card.,btohqsg
Japan really still need physical card to tap. As I went kagoshima last Oct. All must use physical card to tap in order for the transaction to go through.,btohqsg
Why not possible for simply go?,btohqsg
Without fx fees and gives rewards on almost everything. If locally or payment online there are so much more better cards out there if the transactions are not excluded.,btohqsg
Hi  debating to opening HSBC EGA  but I‚Äôm still confused on how the bonus interest works:- For the 1% from the Everyday+ program  do u need to send the SMS to activate it every month?- For the Bonus Interest promotion (is like +2.85% for the current promo from March - May)  is the 2.85% interest for all fresh funds deposited in the first month (March)  or will it apply to fresh funds deposited during April and May too?,btohqsg
For 1% everyday+  you don't need to send sms.At the moment  accounts opened in 2025 onwards are not eligible for bonus interest promotion.,btohqsg
Oh  well then I guess I‚Äôm asking when it‚Äôs eligible  is that how it works?So then how do u ensure u always have the 1% from everyday+ (and also the 1% cashback from Giro transfers?),btohqsg
For 1% cashback  i have automatic transfer. 1x 2000$ in and 5x 400$ back out beginning of each month.For bonus interest  my understanding its 2.85% freshfund compared to benchmark month. Will be Feb for Mar-May registration.,btohqsg
Topping up SimplyGo doesn‚Äôt earn chocolate miles.No?,btohqsg
topping up explicitly excluded. but can still tap the card for bus/mrt,btohqsg
Chocolate card can tap for bus / Mrt?,btohqsg
So is it I have to wait till the current promo is over before I can qualify for the bonus interest next round? Cause assuming I open now  it wouldn‚Äôt be new when the new promo is announced?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think u get BI for new accounts . Just the 1%,btohqsg
Bonus interest is based on when one sends sms so you can open anytime. Just need to lower ur balance (to min 2k) before the month you want to register.However  it's moot as new account is not eligible anyway.,btohqsg
So I have to wait till my account isn‚Äôt new anymore next promotion  basically? Or when will new users be eligible for BI again,btohqsg
As of now  account opened after 2025 is not eligible. And nobody knows when HSBC will introduce new promotions for them.In the mean time  can still open HSBC ega for giro 1% cashback for bills. It's good.,btohqsg

It not Amex card of cos can tap.. simply go,btohqsg
Talking about chocolate card. Ie: physical chocolate card can tap bus/ Mrt for heymax miles?,btohqsg
yes can tap physical chocolate card or via google/apple pay,btohqsg
Yes   even the debit card from posb or dbs can too for tapping,btohqsg
that depends on the merchant  right? Yuu is not good for every grocery shop e.g. Sheng Siong,btohqsg
yuu only good for giant/cold storage,btohqsg
What about insurance? Since there are changes to axs payment now,btohqsg
still good of can pay direct to insurance company e.g. prudential,btohqsg
Guys if i want to clear my UOB and ready for next month promo  do i need to clear my uob to be totally zero or can i leave 10-20k inside and just need to put back 150k in?,btohqsg
Leaving Uob at $1001 adb is the most optimal.Then when u take part u keep it at $151 001 adb,btohqsg
can is can but the 10k-20k will only get 0.05% interest on the month of earmark,btohqsg
If more than that  the interest is not generating right? Ok got it thanks alot!,btohqsg
actually now is already mid month. Depends on how much you have but clearing to zero may still be above 1k MAB.,btohqsg
Hi guys a noob question. How do I get krisflyer miles on my uob krisflyer card? Like do I get uni$   or how?,btohqsg
UOB Krisflyer will earn Krisflyer miles. Other uob miles cards will earn uni$,btohqsg
