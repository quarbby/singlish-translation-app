Can I confirm that Amaze+CRMC notEligible for 10x points for buying both air tickets and hotel bookings?,btohqsg

Hi all! I've had my citi rewards card since I started my 1st job 13 yrs ago. I never bothered to increase credit limit. Now I'm a SAHM. Any hacks how we can request permanent increase of credit limit without salary? I want to maximise miles when we do big purchases,btohqsg
What is your credit limit now for CRMC card?,btohqsg
Recently we bought air tickets ($4K) and cos we've already hit our uob one card spending for cashback  we thought to get some points instead. So we overpaid the cc and bought the tickets. Still works but wonder if I can just increase the limit moving forward.,btohqsg
It's $1.2K since forever üòÇ never had issues cos I use and pay immediately.Really just to collect points,btohqsg
Credit limit at 1200 is really low,btohqsg
CRMC only give 4mpd up to $1k. Beyond that almost similar to pay using your bank atm/debit card  CRMC also exclude airticket too.,btohqsg
Hi does anymore knows whether lalamove Topup will earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
max cap is 1k  and i dont think travel related gives for 4mpd,btohqsg
Ahhh that's useful to know. So no point increasing my limit then? So can earn max 4000 mile per mth?Yes later we realised our air tickets were not 4mpd üò≠,btohqsg
if you have another card  i dont see a point in increasing your limit. since the bonus points are only up to 1k spending,btohqsg

Yeah my other card is uob one (higher limit) and we usually only spend less than $1k. Only time we spent more than $1K for a quarter was when we moved and bought furnitures,btohqsg
No point to increase. $1.2k just nice. Max 4k miles per month.,btohqsg
I think big purchase can use uob visa signatures.  Cap at 2k. Correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg

Hi Gurus. Anyone know when does OCBC usually credit salary bonus? I received my save bonus on 10th May but have yet to received the salary bonus even though my salary was transferred with SALA description in 25th April.,btohqsg
So if u didn‚Äôt receive means don‚Äôt have,btohqsg
Do they only start to recognize the payment transfer with ‚ÄúSala‚Äù description may onwards?,btohqsg
Is it from corp and above the threshold?,btohqsg
Does Singtel great eastern car insurance premium payment count towards normal spending?,btohqsg
you are saying the '60k' promo rate bonus is for SGD fullerton and the '80k' SGD bonus is for the US market fund?,btohqsg
Yup it is from corp account and abv,btohqsg
Probably call CSO to check then.,btohqsg
"The statement you copy out already stated ""S$80 000/US$60 000 "" is 80k for SGD and 60k for USD?",btohqsg
no  my question is that there seems to be 2 on-going promotions for the moomoo cash plus fund. one is saying 6.8% is for 60k SGD  the other is saying for 80k SGD/60k USD,btohqsg
so if i were to transfer  do i transfer 60k or 80k?,btohqsg
