They should tweak the COE system. COE bid yourself and full cash. Once you secure COE then you go car shopping. Maybe 20% down-payment.,btohqsg
Wah full cash COE then still need downpayment,btohqsg

Which friend will give his name go submit COE. Maybe friend personally want to buy car also?,btohqsg
Oh this can work. Cat E for rich people to play.,btohqsg
