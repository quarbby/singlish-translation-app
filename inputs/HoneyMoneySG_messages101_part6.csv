Side question but Iâ€™m thinking to get the kobo libra colour. Itâ€™s in preorder now and any suggestion on best card or hacks for me to save more or get more miles out of this? Haha thank you,btohqsg
Anybody knows if Iâ€™m a young SEP and my CPF hit BHS and FRS: can I still VC3A into my CPF up to $37740? The excess will flow into OA? Will I still be eligible for tax relief with VC3A this way.,btohqsg
It's 37% of your Net trade income. So vc3a up to $37 740 if only you declared $102k NTIhttps://youtu.be/9BE-3QaOc7k?si=TWR_cgAzg1QfiHK5,btohqsg
So no issues even though Iâ€™ve already hit FRS and BHS ya? Wonâ€™t refund. And will probably overflow into OA,btohqsg
SA will stay in SA. Only MA will flow to OA.,btohqsg
I may be wrong but For self employed  vc3a and vcma both contribute to the same cap from my experience. RSTU-SA no issue,btohqsg
Hi my citi credit card bill is due tomorrow. Bank transfer from another bank needs about 2 working days  any other way to pay by today so that it is reflected before the due date?,btohqsg
Why does it take a few days to receive the payment is received email?,btohqsg
I mean like after I do a fast transfer via ocbc bank to pay the citi credit card bill  they only record my payment about 2 working days on the app and send an email that they have received the payment,btohqsg
For HSBC ega  understand the term financial institution is very vague. Does anyone have any idea if giro payment to another bank for car loan will be nerfed?,btohqsg
u sure u paying via FAST?,btohqsg
only crypto/shares related excluded according to cso  need to test in May,btohqsg
About HSBC EGA Giro  I think we all shall stop calling CSO. There is not much we can change. Just need to wait for May and check our account to see what are included and what are excluded.,btohqsg
Did u transfer on public holiday or weekend?,btohqsg
Weekday  do you normally receive the email immediately after transferring?,btohqsg

SSB is not a real bond.Thanks to the special feature of being able to sell back to government at 100 anytime AS WELL AS not being free market tradeable  the price of SSB will not change. It is always at 100%.You CANNOT PROFIT OR LOSE on SSB principal. Locked at 100%.Unlike you buy UST or normal bonds. If interest rates drop  your bond price can shoot up.,btohqsg
hsbc revolution on give 4mpd for online/contactless for a whitelist of MCCs,btohqsg
Hi guys! my CRMC billing cycle is currently 5th of each month. CSO informed that the available dates to change to are only 10th or 15th of the month.If my intention is for it to be aligned to the calendar month as much as possible (for ease of tracking the $1k spend bonus cap together with Amaze local 1k spend cap)  would 5th be the best option? thank you!also  the CSO informed that all other dates are maxed out - so does this mean that other dates may open up after awhile? will anyone be able to advise please. the CSO said that they cannot advise on that. Thank you!,btohqsg
For nets auto top up  no workaround right? Haha,btohqsg
Doesn't matter if not aligned. CRMC 1k cap is based on statement month not calendar month,btohqsg
oh sorry! to clarify  want to align it for pairing with Amaze $1k local spend based on calendar month,btohqsg
as in alternative is just use simplygo,btohqsg
Hi guys  wanna quickly clear this doubt. Iâ€™m using citibank rewards + amaze at the moment  was wondering if i dine out on restaurants/cafe  am i entitled to 4mpd if i pay using citi rewards? Or should i use amaze? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
nope. Need to use Amaze to pay and ensure it links to your citi rewards credit card.,btohqsg
Hello can check if i can use my miles to claim ticket for family members? Or can only use miles for my own ticket?,btohqsg
Add them as redemption nominees and you can redeem for them too,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s a limit on no u can add and how often you can change the nominees,btohqsg
Do you mean add them in my SIS webpage?,btohqsg
Add in your krisflyer acct when u are booking for them,btohqsg
yeah under SIA website after you login  under Profile  there is a NOMINEES page (need OTP).You can add up to 5.,btohqsg
Any Dp on card approval time for Maybank ?,btohqsg
Hi all.. can I check Amaze can't linked to apple pay or Samsung pay?,btohqsg
Not yet. Instarem person during Seedly finance festival said apple pay will be up in next 1-2 months. Android can google pay amaze,btohqsg
eagerly awaiting... then easier to share amaze cards !,btohqsg
But we can use paywave on Amaze right?,btohqsg
They have no intention to add to Samsung Pay is it?,btohqsg
Can I check if I use instarem physical to pay using paywave. Is that consider contactless payment? Will it affect with citi reward?,btohqsg
Also CIMB Visa invinite 4 lounges per year,btohqsg
use Amaze card linked to citi rewards card is online to citi rewards card,btohqsg
Unlikely. They need to register for partnership with Samsung and it's up to Samsung to keep them also,btohqsg
Can i check if citibank pm card can gain miles from telecomm? From max  it seems like mcc is 4814 and its not blacklisted on the tnc,btohqsg
