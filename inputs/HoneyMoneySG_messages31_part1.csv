Hey guysIf I get a supplementary card (HSBC revolution/ citi rewards) to my wife. Will she have her own 4 miles per $1 max out at 1k as well? or since it‚Äôs a supplementary card we will both share the points up to 1k? Anyone tried it before?Thanks,btohqsg
All points go back to principle card holder. And no  a single limit of 1k across both principle and sup card holder,btohqsg
I see. So it doesn‚Äôt worth it‚Ä¶I got citi rewards   HSBC revolution and DBS world woman‚Äôs card. Tried to get uob platinum visa but rejected. Trying to figure out other ways to maximize miles. Any suggestions?,btohqsg

can anyone advice on how to add Amaze card on the iphone?works on my android google pay but does not work on apple‚Äôs applepay nor googlepay,btohqsg
Amaze card doesn't support iPhones  it's Google Pay only,btohqsg
So all these 4 cards can be used for hotel banquet payment. So contactless means I need go down physically to tap their machine ? If is via online payment link  means only dbs woman   HSBC revo ? Uob visa signature and UOB PPV need me go down pay in person via contactless?,btohqsg
ah i see  so theres no way i can use the amaze card on the iphone as contactless. appreciate your reply sir,btohqsg
Unfortunately that's the case. You can still tap with physical amaze card to convert your card spending into online,btohqsg
theres a post on the instarem page dated 31 jan 23 says that the compatibility of amaze with apple will be launched soon. lets see.,btohqsg
Can amaze pair with visa ?,btohqsg

Watch this space.""As soon as Instarem Amaze is supported on Apple Pay  I will be using a lot more Amaze than I do now.The only question is  when this happens  will the Citi-Amaze connection be cut or lost?",btohqsg
I will definitely make room for the Amaze card. üôÇ,btohqsg
No Apple Pay is also ok la 1 card is how heavy  üòÜ,btohqsg

Citi cutting off amaze and amaze supporting Apple Pay won't be correlated,btohqsg

Off topic but finally no need panik over broken mask üòÇ,btohqsg
I hope so.I have the misguided view that amaze cutting DBS from points earning totally almost the same time as amaze supporting Visa happens simultaneously.,btohqsg
Looking to apply uob miles card  apply through money smart or UOB site better?,btohqsg
Anyone able to apply for ocbc titanium recently? Website seems broken.. tried on many devices,btohqsg
