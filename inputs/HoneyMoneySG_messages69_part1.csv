Like to ask. With this change healthcare services there will be a 1% fee by amaze. But healthcare is not excluded in CBMC. So technical will still earn the 4MPD right just that need pay extra 1%,btohqsg
Uob one quarter is different for everyone  not the standard quarter  u need to call to ask,btohqsg
Citi rewards 1x point is 0.4 miles  so u be getting more on lady overall due to the 6 miles per dollar on first 1 k,btohqsg
Can someone explain to me how a debit card can get misused if someone has never used it or swipe it in any places before?,btohqsg

Anyone knows for ocbc if I alr have existing cards I apply for new card will it be immediate? And will it draw data from cbs again?,btohqsg
Credit card generator  it is random hack  not specific,btohqsg
I noticed the same money with initial interest is being used to buy another set of MMF for Oct. If so  can it still be withdrawn?,btohqsg
If u know how the card number are generated by bank then u know there is a pattern to it. Certain place/website no otp for spending. So the transaction just goes through. U can file dispute with the bank. So do check your bank transaction regularly. It is more common the one thought,btohqsg
the 16 numbers are more or less easy to guess   just need expiry date and cvvwhich expiry date is usually 5 years and cvv only got 999 numbers so basically 60*999 is about the combination required to gain access . but most bank should have mechanisms in place to prevent such brute forcing of exp date and cvv,btohqsg
Can i check for UOB CC  when will i receive the cashback? Is it the next statement month?,btohqsg
Anyone calculated this before? Mari bank 2.88% pa is higher or gxs 2.68% pa but gxs is compounded daily,btohqsg
What do you mean? Both is compounded daily  2.88% is definitely higher than 2.68%,btohqsg
Maribank also deposit the interest daily and then derive the next day's interest based on yesterday's balance?,btohqsg
Thanks. Couldnt find this info  during the early stages. So wonder if that's change.,btohqsg
Never changed since Mar 23. Less the rates,btohqsg
Maribank needed face verification for transfer money out  even for $1  overkill but high security is good,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for this promotion. Is it I can just withdraw my money from UOB account and deposit it back the next day.  This is considered as a fresh fund? Sorry if this is a silly question cox I‚Äôm just curious how it works. Thanks in advance. üôè,btohqsg
more importantly u got empty your account on 30 Sep?,btohqsg
Unfortunately no  coz I just saw this message now. And this mean Im not qualified for this promotion? Cos it stated promotion ends on end December. Thanks for helping to answer my question..,btohqsg
fresh fund is wrt to 30 Sep end balance,btohqsg
Meaning now I‚Äôm not qualified for this promotion anymore right? Pardon me if this is a dumb question. üòÖ,btohqsg
u can take part  but not as efficient/profitable as someone who had $1 in UOB One account as at 30th Sep.,btohqsg
Thanks for answering my question.  I‚Äôll just do it this month and enjoy whatever extra interest I‚Äôm entitled. Appreciate your help,btohqsg
Cannot like that. U need to follow tiers.If you are willing to share what is your 30th Sep day end balance  we can advise u better,btohqsg
wah then totally not worth to play UOB One under the new earmark promoif your 30th Sep is exactly SGD100k already  you are better off opening a brand new Stash account or something and put another $100 000 there and register that stash account,btohqsg
(do not touch your original UOB One $100k),btohqsg
Purpose is only for Fast Transfer and not paynow in DBS,btohqsg
yes can use FAST for salary crediting to uob,btohqsg
Removed for both paynow and fast?,btohqsg
singles bto can only get 2rm flexi  your gains refer to appreciation of the unit? if so then it might not be much. huge risk taken if you stop work just for this purpose. unless you mean the grant outweighs 2 year salary? then it will only materialise if you manage to get allocated,btohqsg
Does this affect normal spending like dining etc?,btohqsg
Anyone know if u are able to cancel hsbc credit card if u collected their luggage sign up gift? Or is it need hold the card for 1yrs?,btohqsg
Anyone got problem with instarem? My remittance until now haven‚Äôt credited. They give me reference number but when i check with my bank they said the reference number is not on their system.,btohqsg
Sorry  May I know for Woman world card to Pay via Kris + appdoes it consider online if use ?I called DBS  they cannot give me an answer ü•≤,btohqsg
Will need to find another card...,btohqsg
Is that the same for shopback?,btohqsg
want to check for petrol SPC using UOB lady's card will it still qualify for points? I know the T&C said no UNI points but will still get credited,btohqsg
Ya seems like it for ocbc,btohqsg
On the mobile app. Someone said that the ibanking portal still supports,btohqsg
Yes. Bonus UNI$14/$5 (5.6mpd) next month.,btohqsg
Hi üëã does anyone know if we can apply for both UOB lady and solitaire  and set separate bonus categories for each?,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask when overseas  grab travel use UOB one card better or Amaze+CRMC?,btohqsg
isnt there currency conversion fee + admin fee etc if you use uob one for overseas payment? using amaze + crmc would be better in general since amaze should have lower overall fees as its converts to overseas currency at a lower fee in general,btohqsg
I also just saw the message. If the participation date is 1st Nov  does it mean I can empty my account on 31st Oct ?,btohqsg
no.. the magical date for the UOB Christmas earmark promo is 30th Sep.. and 30th sep ONLY..if u didn't empty out your UOB One account on 30th Sep.. you are out of luck..,btohqsg
think the 5% bonus will more than offset the fees,btohqsg
need to read tnc if the bonus is applicable to overseas grab? since overseas grab and singapore grab should be different . Not sure on this,btohqsg
Thank you. Thankfully my 30 Sept is 20k only. So it might make sense for me to still do it. HahaThe alternative is stash account I suppose.,btohqsg
