also how does S/Uing a module affect this,btohqsg
do SU mods not count into AUs,btohqsg
They do but there's a cap to the amount u can SU,btohqsg
the 3 Bs add up to how many units,btohqsg
Yeah although what are the AUs of his B+ mod?,btohqsg
then cant he carry over the remaining 8 SUable units to y2,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the answer for the ÈòÖËØªÁêÜËß£‰∏Ä üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
again  depends on if he thinks if he can get A- or above for everything else,btohqsg
Usually as he progresses the rigour would get harder tho.. I think B+ is fine from a cGPA perspective so just keep the amount of S/U able credits first for another year,btohqsg
Bruh then just S/U if he can continue with a average A- grade -_-,btohqsg
why was the mothers hand red,btohqsg
no i thought it was c,btohqsg
Hi guys  I'm planning to drop out from poly to enter JC.I did pretty well for o levels with net l1r5 of 6 last yr.Currently I'm in poly first semester and I'm looking at peer influence in poly vs jc  potential of definitely entering into university of my choice  as well as cost in long run from poly to uni and JC to uni as I want to get a degree.What do y'all think?,btohqsg
Also which JC do you wanna aim for?What stream and combi do u want?What uni course are u aiming for?What is your Combi for Os?,btohqsg
lmao fr yeah my poly first sem fees is like 1.5k,btohqsg
and im assuming that jc fees are much much cheaper (probably comparable to secondary school?) not sure.,btohqsg
Depends if he's aiming for Independent schools then that answer would be a no,btohqsg
independent schools as in like ri/hci? kind,btohqsg
Yeah those cost more than poly,btohqsg
its independent rather than government (aided) thats why,btohqsg
I thrive irregardless of the envt  even in poly I still make notes for every topic,btohqsg
Yeah but it's well worth tho if u can get in,btohqsg
like how private unis is more expensive than public unis,btohqsg
Na it ain't even private tbh it's just cuz of the breath and resources afforded to you at a independent school,btohqsg
Annual cost of independent JC is less than poly still?,btohqsg
true  looking at my sister's sec sch grades she can probably get in but ri/hci is very far from my home so she'll probably choose a jc that has a similar cop but nearer to my home,btohqsg
huh is it more or less,btohqsg
I never attended a independent school but it is more than Poly fees,btohqsg
I'm actually not sure about what courses are avail,btohqsg
Pros for poly:-if u know what u wanna do in uni  poly is a heads up for what is there to come- longer sem breaks in between meaning u can do whatever u want during holidays-if u are able to study consistently good and get high gpa  able to go straight to year 2 uni (only for limited courses)Cons- sch fees higher than jc-3 years instead of 2- need to mug every few months instead of just preparing for one A levels,btohqsg
The year 2 uni also need to put a caveat cuz those module exemptions mainly only for Engineering courses,btohqsg
Yeah RI and HCI is more,btohqsg
That's kinda why I feel like we need more info.. as to what the course is and what he's aiming for,btohqsg
But comparing to Poly it's more,btohqsg
So I am just using poly fees as a bench mark cuz he is asking that,btohqsg
And cannot go to other courses. Say if u study electrical engineering in poly  u can only go year 2 electrical engineering in uni  other majors need to start from year 1,btohqsg
Another point is for poly u are only comparing against your coursemates so bellcurve aint that bad,btohqsg
Ok that one also need to caveat not all polys use bellcurve for grading iykyk,btohqsg

the standard price is around 335 but I was under the impression that most of not all ppl have the edusave scholarship,btohqsg
Poly can apply for bursary tho,btohqsg
Exactly we are talking about raw cost,btohqsg
Can cover one sem worth of sch fees if u know how to cheat the system,btohqsg
Yeah 1k for bursary the rest PSEA,btohqsg
I know a guy getting outside bursary on top of poly bursary,btohqsg
wouldn't you be eligible for EESIS if you qualify for RI,btohqsg
But then again someone pays 6k so I cannot say la,btohqsg
Tbh cost savings at poly/jc level is kinda insignificant when u compare it to uni,btohqsg
that's the point tho save in poly/jc to afford uni üò≠,btohqsg
There's no such thing as save in poly/jc if u wanna get into big 3,btohqsg
