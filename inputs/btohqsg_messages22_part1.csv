Hello  can i check for the HDB staggering downpayment  it states that the application must be submitted on or before the younger applicant's 30 birthday. Can i check the application refers to the date we select the unit or the date when we obtain the hfe/date of application for the bto,btohqsg

helloo does anyone know for hfe supporting documents  my gf and i are currently both ft students. Which documents should I be submitting? since theres the cbs report  bank statements etc.,btohqsg
In theory  no. If 80% chinese quota of 260 means 208 chinese quota only. If everyone before u is a chinese and everyone selects  then your 233 queue cannot selectbut in real life  yes. A lot of ppl will drop out and not everyone is a chinese too,btohqsg
hi how did you navigate to this page?,btohqsg
