but say it is possible  why wun society welfare be further enhanced,btohqsg
You are building like roads in the neighbourhood. Obviously building roads will increase social welfare but at the same time it will increase pollution while you build the roads,btohqsg
this out of pt  bud said it out of the blue,btohqsg
hi mayushii  there is someone who is interested in Japan uni and working in japan. will u be ok if I ping him and he can ask u some qns ?,btohqsg
Every road you build  you are generating more positive welfare than generating the negative welfare from the air pollution due to building,btohqsg
Obviously there comes to a point when building too much roads is pointless and can create a lot of social problems,btohqsg
oki@darkharbingeroftheabysscultthis is mayushii who works in Japan currently,btohqsg
So you want to build enough roads,btohqsg
he may be better suited to answer ur qn,btohqsg
wtv u mentioned  you're starting to look from the bigger picture,btohqsg
oh so like more of while increasing societal welfare  it is inevitably increasing pollution  so cant really try to aim for 0,btohqsg
0 pollution means you are not building roads,btohqsg
But building roads generates a lot of positive welfare when you start building it,btohqsg
omg MSB reminds me of meridian soccer boys,btohqsg
So every unit of road you build  your MSB > MSC until you reach the point where it becomes too overkill,btohqsg
so like MSB will kinda be reduced at the expense if we try to cut pollution,btohqsg
and regarding pollution as a negative externality  just need to cut in moderation to not compromise on welfare?,btohqsg
actually i did not think about this aspect:-(,btohqsg
Same for building a electricity factory,btohqsg
I mean the qn is not very clear  cos air pollution arises from the production of goods and services. So the horizontal axis would not be “quantity of air pollution” but rather goods and services that can lead to air pollution during production/consumption as a negative externality,btohqsg
Generating electricity is good but it will cause pollution,btohqsg
But of course we don't want to generate too much,btohqsg
It’s just like how for cigarettes the socially optimal level is not Q=0,btohqsg
from the question  i did not look so deep into it,btohqsg
So we want to find that optimal point,btohqsg
How many days you ck this year,btohqsg
esch can be a econs tutor before even entering uni,btohqsg
oh btw have u gotten offer,btohqsg
But I was legit sick those days except 1 where I just went for a medical appt and doctor gave me an MC despite me not needing one,btohqsg
You generate enough electricity but do not generate too much pollution until it becomes a problem,btohqsg
If your unit doesn’t have mc restriction then just Keng lor,btohqsg
But also do it only if you have no work,btohqsg
im a crazy bad example not to learn from...i went to school with a fever before,btohqsg
Else your colleagues will hate you,btohqsg
just coz idw to skip lessons and watch the lecture recording,btohqsg
And if your chers are nice they could zoom the lesson,btohqsg
actually even in sec sch  i love band too much  i once went to cca even when i was down w a flu,btohqsg
my jc time is still non-covid lol,btohqsg
i didnt know its existence until i entered uni,btohqsg
For me getting extra sleep is the motivation,btohqsg
I hate waking up at 6+,btohqsg
neh zoom is much better than teams,btohqsg
I’m a light sleeper so can’t fall asleep,btohqsg
Some siao ppl actually enforce the rule,btohqsg
Then how come you can sleep,btohqsg
I thought SAF got more redundant stuff though?,btohqsg
Like even ASA got competency test,btohqsg
Ya that’s what I mean  got redundant stuff,btohqsg
For scdf I think it depends where you get posted to,btohqsg
But not as lucky as those stories I heard of ppl in the SAF where they only report to work 5-10 days per month,btohqsg
