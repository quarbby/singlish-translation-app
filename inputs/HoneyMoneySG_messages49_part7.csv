"I am of another opinion. That you should be the CEO of your life and treat your career and transferrable skills as the ""product"" and once you get good enough in those transferable skills you can set out on your own and build your own personal brand. People and companies will then look for your services since you are now the expert.",btohqsg
Anyone HSBC users received the unique code already?,btohqsg
Eh  paywave is unique to visa so Amex is not able to use paywave. Unless you are referring to contactless payment? Mastercard version of contactless is paypass but I guess visa’s marketing is stronger so everyone just conveniently refers to it as paywave,btohqsg
Amex has its own version called expresspay,btohqsg
Can I check HSBC ega extra 1% for Cashback and increase share the same pot of 300 cap per month?,btohqsg
where did you read about 300 cap?,btohqsg
300 monthly cap for everyday+ interest. 300 combined monthly cap for CC cashback and GIRO,btohqsg
For HSBC revo  the bonus 9x points is based on calendar month right but is it based on transacted date or transaction posted date ?,btohqsg
oh not the EGA bonus interest right? gave me a shock.,btohqsg
Yes  everyday+ interest is separate from the bonus interest. Bonus interest cap is up to 2mil in deposits I think,btohqsg
yes I also remember it's 2mil. phew.,btohqsg

Hi sifus  wanted to ask is the bonus interest (4%+ pa) for EGA only applicable for one time? Or can apply every month via message?,btohqsg
it depends which month u started  if last month it will last for 3 months. this month's  only 2 months,btohqsg
So this bonus interest is only for one time right?,btohqsg
there is new promo every month. But if still under a promo window then registration for new promo will be invalid. And you may want to make sure to empty the account in month just before u register for new promo to have maximum incremental balance wrt to reference month.,btohqsg
