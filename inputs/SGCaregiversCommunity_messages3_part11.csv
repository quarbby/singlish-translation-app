I'm going to try and push harder on Monday when I meet the PT to finalize the equipment dad requires  but I feel a little overwhelmed now.Many thanks to Greg for helping me with the hospital bed  I alr put the deposit for the delivery  at least for now my dad has a bed to sleep in  so I'm trying to pace it out so I feel I can breathe a little easier.,btohqsg
from what we understand  they cannot allow discharge unless caregiver is confident in managing and able to perform all the required support to the patient.. PT can support your concerns to the doctor  try to articulate your problems to the PT and Dr again. Good luck,btohqsg
Better to get a caregiver (not helper) and share room with your father.,btohqsg
Hey Cindy  not sure if this might help  but there‚Äôs a NUHS caregivers day event going on at Ng Teng Fong general hospital this Saturday  and caring for patients with dementia is a topic that they‚Äôre covering,btohqsg
The room is so small  I don't know where the caregiver will sleep? I've never hired a helper before.,btohqsg
Ah thanks. I'll be busy shifting furniture and getting my place ready this weekend  hope it can be useful for others...,btohqsg
If your father has his own room   the caregiver can sleep on floor mattress. I dun know how small is small but definitely need rearrangements . Caregiver will help to lighten your load and you can have more time to care for your son .,btohqsg
Moreover the bedroom is currently occupied by a tenant  I kept telling the Dr and PT and MSW she will only move out mar 8  but they keep telling me discharge is next wed...,btohqsg
Icic. Ok I'll try to figure that option out. Currently still have to put my dad in the living room until the tenant moves out,btohqsg
Talk to geriatric doctor and MSW . They can help you more than the rest.,btohqsg
Ok thank you so much. I will.,btohqsg
All the best . Dun give up üëçüí™,btohqsg
Maybe you can meet AIC offices personally. See what options you have.,btohqsg
AIC LINK OFFICES. Talk to then personally. They should able to help.,btohqsg
They got a few offices..look for one near your place.,btohqsg
*there is one AIC office at seng kang community hospital. Hope it helps.,btohqsg
Gd afternoon  may I know for the transfer of automatic hospital bed  can normal mover handle or need technician to dismantle and assemble? Thanks.,btohqsg
HiBkdepends on the product and model  most people move it as a whole by professional companies that specialized in moving hospital bed to prevent possible damage  while some used normal movers as they know how to guide the movers where to take note. You may google hospital bed movers and easily find some options for you to compare.,btohqsg
Hi  how to get over grief? Heart pain  broken and traumatised.. sometimes the mind keep rewinding the dying process for my father.,btohqsg
Is there a support group?I have been talking to different groups of friends daily but I think I don‚Äôt want to keep reaching out cos everyone is also busy.,btohqsg
I know AIC got some helplines for that..,btohqsg
Exercise and take up more healthy activities,btohqsg
It is not easy to get over grief. I'm have been through. It takes a long time. I still have to move on.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself about getting over it. Instead  try sitting with your grief  understanding it  and eventually learning to carry it differently. It‚Äôs completely okay to feel sad‚Äîyour father was important to you  especially if this happened recently.Sitting with grief is part of the healing process  but it‚Äôs important not to stay stuck in it. Seeking help is a step forward. Here are some support providers you can reach out to:Viriya Comm ServicesO Joy Care ServicesSAGE CounsellingEveryone grieves differently. For me  I feel it more intensely at night  and certain events bring back memories unexpectedly. If you ever need someone to talk to  you can callSamaritans of Singapore (SOS)at1800 221 4444anytime.,btohqsg
Thanks but I try not to go back to Assisi where my father passed away. I spent some time there and if going back  may rake up more bad memories.,btohqsg

Hello does anyone have a shower chair to sell/donate? Or any places to buy one,btohqsg
hi@Will1890most hospital pharmacy carries them  we're aware that shopee and taobao has alot of options as well - depend how rush you need it. We have caregivers giving it away at times  let's wait for the rest to shout out in case they have 1 to spare.,btohqsg
Is there a way to cover up the centre part so its more comfortable for my mom?,btohqsg
oh i am so sorry i read wrongly of your request.I think i see a shower chair somewhere else  let me check and come back again later,btohqsg
Hi just asking around if anyone has any recommendations to get sacrum dressings at a cheaper price? Like the one in the pic.Asking as I just spent quite a lot at cgh pharmacy for the allevyn life sacrum (close to $20/ piece.) my mom insists she needs two pieces a day for my 97y.o. grandmother who's bedbound.,btohqsg
Hi@pursedinoi see some options on Shopee and its about $10/pcs. In taobao (china e-commerce) sells about $7 per pcs excluding shipping. Malaysia website shows that its about SGD $10 approx as well  potentially can get bulk pricing which lowers it a little  but shipping will increase as well for bulk.,btohqsg
There are advanced sacrum dressings (e.g.  foam dressings with silicone borders) offer extended wear (up to 5‚Äì7 days) if the wound condition allows. If the wound is not heavily exuding  hydrocolloid dressings can provide longer wear time compared to foam-based alternatives - so that you don't have to change it too often. Some seniors may be using two pieces due to inadequate coverage. Using a larger  appropriately shaped or custom shaped dressing (e.g.  sacral-shaped foam) might reduce the need for multiple dressings.You may want to consult the doctor for advice (on your mom's observation that 2 pcs is needed for your grandma  it could mean a reassessment might be needed).,btohqsg
Is there a caregiver support group for parents taking care of teens with mental issues like adhd bpd,btohqsg
Hello  anyone who has their parents in Transitional Care Facility (TCF @ west - pancare medical)... Any idea what's the fees like? Pioneer gen got further subsidy or discount? Can PM me,btohqsg
hi Audrey  TCF typically costs between $75~150 as a day rate (depending on the residency status of the individual).Regarding financial assistance  patients may utilise MediSave and MediShield Life to offset eligible expenses:- MediShield Life: Coverage is subject to approval  with a claim limit of $350 per day.- MediSave: Withdrawals are capped at $250 per day  up to a maximum of $5 000 per calendar year.Family members can also use their MediSave to pay for approved dependents.For Pioneer Generation members  the government provides additional support through the Pioneer Generation Package. This includes special subsidies of 40‚Äì60% for MediShield Life premiums  depending on age  and annual MediSave top-ups ranging from $250 to $900.For precise information on how these subsidies apply to services at TCF @ West  it's advisable to contact PanCare Medical directly or consult with a medical social worker.,btohqsg
Need to be mindful that TCF only provides short-term stays while the family works on a long-term care plan. A prolonged stay at any healthcare facility  including TCF  may result in overstayer charges if the patient is assessed to be medically stable and has feasible discharge options.I agree to speak with the medical social worker there to learn more about the fees and discuss the care plan if needed.,btohqsg
