Employers must understand that if a weight limit of 2 bridges is 500kg each  piling 750kg on one bridge temporarily is disastrous.,btohqsg
If you need to cover for your colleague  his pay for the day should belong to you. Vice versa if you take leave  your pay for the day should be credited to the one covering for you.,btohqsg
It's simply not fair if one colleagues keeps taking absence for work and expect no consequences.,btohqsg
