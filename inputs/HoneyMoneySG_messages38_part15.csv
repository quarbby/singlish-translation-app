Hi guys  saw this channel on YouTube and I found it interesting  I‚Äôm currently a nsf and I got peanuts allowance  is there any tips on saving as much money as possible  those males who went to ns maybe can share some experience on how u guys save?,btohqsg
Not sure how to survive with the peanut allowance,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt follow your rich NSF friends eat canteen for every meal,btohqsg
Look for side hustles like guard duties,btohqsg
Canteen food not often  I do apply for financial stuff in ns but is just extra few hundred making the total still less than 1k,btohqsg
Agree  it‚Äôs about average balance  if there are days you are below 2k  you need to put more on other days to make up,btohqsg
dont spend too much on bubble tea or unnecessary stuff and you may consider high saving accounts for your bank savings üòÄ,btohqsg
- dont go canteen  eat cookhouse- don't go nights out  watch youtube videos and learn- don't go clubbingAbove applies when you really want to save money. But once in awhile won't hurt- most importantly  don't sign ILP from those roadshow agents especially if they are good looking,btohqsg
How I wish the allowance is more lol but that won‚Äôt happen at all,btohqsg
To be honest  while it's important to be prudent  i actually suggest that you play and enjoy as much as possible during your NS days. We are young only once and we only live once. Honestly  I strongly urge you to seize every opportunity to play and have fun during your NS days. Let go of your worries and create unforgettable memories that will last a lifetime.,btohqsg
Especially when you are quite sure your subsequent one month salary when you enter the workforce is going to easily be more than the amount you tried so hard to save up during the NS days.,btohqsg
Potentially this might get him into trouble lol,btohqsg
Life is short. Enjoy whilst it last and enjoy early . Don‚Äôt be a penny pitcher and only enjoy when u retire . Some may not even live to old age,btohqsg
I see many ‚Äúfinancial gurus‚Äù advocate save save save and become a miser . No use being richest man in the graveyard . Must strike a balance,btohqsg
Haha yeah i agree occasionally eat canteen and bond with friends also not that bad.,btohqsg
During the days where you don't have high earning power  it's a good time to try out paper trading  paper options  test out strategies  watch YouTube etc. but do have a good balance and don't forget to play hard too.,btohqsg
well  take public transport (save those grab/taxis for urgent only)  to and from camp  you can try find those camp-mates who stay near your house/area to fetch you to camp.eat cookhouse food - you saved $$$weekends  just enjoy abit of yourself  maybe treat yourself BBT or limit a budget $10 ? maybe ?,btohqsg
dont think you will be able to do side-hustle if you are NSF   you might be charged for moonlighting,btohqsg
Ye I can‚Äôt even grab food they also don‚Äôt allow,btohqsg
hey guys  anyone knows for the standard chartered bonus$aver account  if i don‚Äôt use my debit card and it‚Äôs purely for my savings and crediting salary into it will i still get the 2.5% interest from crediting my salary?,btohqsg
Use Evo on yakun apps is considered online right ?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if using Atome is considered online payments for UOB EVOL?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  anyone knows whether for the HSBC EGA account it is possible to see the interest to be gained after each month of the promotional period? I know that the interest will come in after the 4 months  but it does feel strange if there‚Äôs no feedback mechanism  especially if you‚Äôre transacting a lot on the account,btohqsg
for HSBC EGA  in order to get the 4.3% pa bonus interest as a new customer  we just need open account and make an initial deposit to qualify?is there other criteria needed? e.g. min. cc spend  giro transaction etc,btohqsg
within 5K can try GXS Bank  3.48% fuss free,btohqsg
Send the sms in on the first month  no other criteria. if you want additional 1% then do the 2K transfer in and 5 x FAST out,btohqsg
i can see the credit interest accrued on app but that should be the basic interest amount only,btohqsg
Not sure can or not. Last time during my ns times with scdf. Can even take part time study courses. So potentially save u more time ahead in life after u posted out.,btohqsg
hihi  is it wise to use the citi payall to pay insurance?,btohqsg
Can I check when is the nerf effective? Have a Prudential payment now,btohqsg
fully agree. this is the reason why I am hesitant to use this. if make a mistake I won't know it until few months later.,btohqsg
https://cardpromotions.hsbc.com.sg/everydayplusHi guys  for the above spend amount bonus  can I clarify that this feature existed even before the 4 months 4.35% Promo?It also looks like it promotes compressing expenses into lump sum of 2k (and 5 transaction)  while the 4 month Promo is more of promoting gradual small expenses  to keep the interest principal from the first topup as high as possible  over 4 months.,btohqsg
Hsbc ega is only for people who are willing to read the t&c carefully and track the bonus window  everyday+ window  reference month etc. If you find it a hassle  means you are not suitable to using hsbc ega. But in the past few years  it has all along given amongst the best interest with very high cap  with no salary or credit card spend required. So it's up to you.,btohqsg
Everyday+ and bonus interest are separate indendent promotions  and both have existed alongside each other for years.,btohqsg
As a comparison  even with the slightly lower bonus interest of 4.35% for April  when used together with everyday+  you can get 5.35% (or even more for premiere) for up to $360k of deposits. No salary credit or cc spend. And compare that with the highly acclaimed uob one with 5% up to $100k.,btohqsg
Anyone has the UOB stash account- is the tracker on the MAB indicated that you need to maintain this month to earn bonus interest accurate ? Dunno why they show me such a high MAB when I‚Äôm sure my MAB last month is much lower,btohqsg
By Everyday+  do you mean the 3 things above that provides cashback for the ‚ÄúSpend‚Äù with account?Also would like to ask if GIRO from EGA to pay for other credit card bill considered to be part of the 2k and one of the transactions,btohqsg
Yes. Don't get too fixated on this 2k requirement. 1st of every month  just transfer in $2k from a non hsbc account  then straight away transfer out the $2k out to a non hsbc account in 5 different transfer transactions. Done.,btohqsg
Oh ok  2k is the deposit  rather than the combined spend of the transactions?,btohqsg
Credit card spend is to satisfy the 5 transactions. Fast out also counts as a transaction. No min spend for CC to qualify as a transaction.,btohqsg
Hi gurus for hsbc EGA giro must fill in the hardcopy form to submit? No online application?,btohqsg
I tried linking citibank rewards card to instarem amazr but keeps failing.,btohqsg
The EGA welcome bundle need to jump thru so many hoops to qualify I dont think I will bother with it....,btohqsg
Any card got rebate for paying income tax?,btohqsg
No more I believe. However if you signup for ACCM there might be a trick or two...,btohqsg
yesalternatively just setup your credit card giroand pay iras using that cc instead üôÉ,btohqsg
Giro rebate 1%cc-giro also eligible  get it?,btohqsg
in this case the giro bill payment is funded by ega,btohqsg
Is EGA the best for giro paying income tax?,btohqsg
So nett nett is no rebate?,btohqsg
