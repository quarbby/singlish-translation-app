Depend on did you take grant from HDB for your current hse.,btohqsg
If yes   you consider 2nd timer.,btohqsg
Is better for you to check on hdb web side.,btohqsg
I might be wrong also   as hdb ruling keep changing.,btohqsg
Thanks xw and Ivan. Never taken grant  so 1st timer here.,btohqsg
"""And if so I must apply for those that expected TOP on or after my current MOP right?"" -> trying to say that if I apply  that BTO must TOP after my current flat's MOP of 5 years. (still serving halfway)",btohqsg
Can only non-mature for my case as apply under Singles Scheme (think also 5% allocation),btohqsg
first thing to take note  though grant is free money from the gahmen  it can only be deposited into your CPFOA  can be used for down-payment too. but once you sold your house  you have to put the grant back PLUS 2.5% accrued interest,btohqsg
for others who are thinking to get resale  if you have plan to BTO in the future  then consider not to take the grant so that you can have first timer chance  take  the grant when your BTO is successful lol,btohqsg
yes well noted on the accrued interest  i used CPF for private property umpteenth times.,btohqsg
erm this is what the system generated not me lol  think whenever someone gives thumbs up or + this happens,btohqsg
Hello. Can I know if I able to increase the HLE?,btohqsg
Last 4 years they say will review the loan. Just received the latter but did not increase or review the loan amount.,btohqsg
tiagong the amount is 65x of your combined salary,btohqsg
either your pay is lower or the same as 4 years ago,btohqsg
Last 4 years only using my wife cpf. Cos I just started working less than a year.,btohqsg
After 65X by right should get higher amount. But they did not ask me to update or anything. Still same loan amount.,btohqsg
as long as work 3 months  conservatively to qualify for loan  probably they are taking your combined pay as average,btohqsg
I will to know if there will more bto at clementi mall?,btohqsg
I am first timer and a lot of things I do not understand if my income ceiling is not high  am I still able to purchase bto for single?,btohqsg
income ceiling for single capped at $7k,btohqsg
but only for 2rm at non mature estate,btohqsg
Has anyone studied the 'increase rate' of SBF pricing vs BTO?,btohqsg
And how much they are really pegged to 'market'? (is there such a thing as market price of SBF in first place),btohqsg
never studied but I only know one 3rm unit in geylang costs $30k more than during the BTO launch in 2017,btohqsg
and it'd be TOP in a year,btohqsg
RE: Whether SBF is really pegged to market pricing.,btohqsg
https://t.me/bidadaribtounless you want to create specially for Nov 2020 ones! :),btohqsg
Hi anyone know by when sale of balance flats results will be in,btohqsg
I have not receieved any letters or email,btohqsg
Dear bto experts  may I know which non matured town u would recommend for BTO in  to have easiest travel to Dakota mrt (by public transport)?,btohqsg
Hougang would be the nearest non mature town followed by Sengkang and punggol,btohqsg
what are you doing at Dakota anyway?,btohqsg
My parents 2rm short lease is there.,btohqsg
I want to be as near as possible  without breaking the bank.,btohqsg
oh I hope my mum gets her sbf in geylang too,btohqsg
for sbf  you can't choose your desired area  Macpherson  circuit rd  etc are under geylang,btohqsg
so hope my mum gets a very low number,btohqsg
so that she can get to choose Dakota,btohqsg
Ur mom doesn't like circuit rd/macpherson area?,btohqsg
Yes see quite a lot sbf left there. But quite ex,btohqsg
she only wants a place where it is like 5 mins walk to the wet market,btohqsg
I love the 2 hawker ctr of circuit rd estate. Too bad if I buy there I would have to die there and end the property game over,btohqsg
Is like almost all built 1969 1970 1971,btohqsg
there is Macpherson spring BTO which the residents moved in 6 months ago,btohqsg
the BTO plot next to Macpherson MRT of May 2021 is good,btohqsg
2rm of 30 years SBF at Macpherson spring is $130k,btohqsg
yes I shared the same thought at first,btohqsg
but realized it's only for 30 years,btohqsg
Oh u mean 30yrs balance. Not 30yo,btohqsg
30 years short lease  for people above 55yo,btohqsg
But can see policy makers treat old folks very well,btohqsg
All the subsidies  choice in matured estate flats  priorities,btohqsg
would you prefer your mum of staying alone at her 4rm with her two stranger tenants and get passive rental income  or staying near you at a 2rm with total privacy?,btohqsg
Personally I would prefer her stay alone coz not many can tahan her,btohqsg
She will step on tenants toes endless.,btohqsg
So ya is really to each his own cases,btohqsg
Currently they still in 5rm 1980flat,btohqsg
anyway 2rm BTO is good enough even for couple without kids,btohqsg
I perfectly get 2rm. In fact it is way spacious than many of the shoeboxes I stayed in with large balconies and or aircon ledges,btohqsg
506sq 2rm HDB  some condo can squeeze 2bedroom in the same floor space!,btohqsg
My dream 2rm layout is like the video with double door entry bathroom but longish HS that can convert Murphy bed cum work desk. Become study and bedroom,btohqsg
I seen some 2.2m by 1.7m,btohqsg
my bathroom is one of the biggest at about 5sqm,btohqsg
Same here too... anyone managed to access to view the result?,btohqsg
I think result will be released on about 4 January 2021,btohqsg
Since 6 weeks since close applications,btohqsg
So SBF need to wait till Jan2021😌,btohqsg
Hihi; do we need to bring HLE letter during our 1st appointment?,btohqsg
Hi I can I know roughly how long will we know the grant amount we get ?,btohqsg
They told me during appointment is via email rite ?,btohqsg
2~3 weeks after your HLE application. And yes you'll be notified via email,btohqsg
Are u serious ? My hle application is on July n I took Aug 2020 bto I select my unit 23 nov till today still not sure of my grant .,btohqsg
you can login to your singpass to check too. did you submit all documents in July? because if you didn't submit all documents then HDB will mail a physical reminder to you asking you to upload everything before the cut-off date. if you missed that then you probably want to submit a new application,btohqsg
Yesyes my hle all approved unit selected also they ask me to waet for my grant result ... I went in to singpass already still doesn’t appear,btohqsg
then that I'm not sure already  sorry can't be too much of a help 😅maybe someone else in the group knows!,btohqsg
It’s ok alrite btw thanks for the effort,btohqsg
Can I know you apply HLE before 1st appointment or after the 1st appointment?,btohqsg
Do we need to wait for the ballot result letter then apply for HLE?Or we just apply for HLE before receive letter from HDB?,btohqsg
Up to u actually cause hle valid for 6 month,btohqsg
What I did is I apply 1st my hle then I apply for the bto launched,btohqsg
just apply since you have to do it eventually too  so why the drag lol,btohqsg
Nearer to your signing of agreement date.,btohqsg
Hi  I tried to search but couldn't find any other than a poll but is there a group for towner crest?,btohqsg
Hi  random question here. What if I were to change Job after my SBF application? Will there be any penalty?,btohqsg
penalty wise  only heard of paying up early for bank loan,btohqsg
probably the loan amount would be different if your salary is not the same,btohqsg
Hi  wanna ask..EHG n HLE is a separate grant right??,btohqsg
Enhanced Housing Grant (EHG) consolidates the Additional Housing Grant (AHG) and Special Housing Grant (SHG) to provide higher grant amounts at a higher income ceiling.,btohqsg
Can i ask:1. Will the HLE be reassessed when I collect the keys?2. When i collect my keys  will the AHG and SHG grant's income assessment be done again?,btohqsg
AHG and SHG combined to be EHG,btohqsg
Hi  is there a chat for melody spring nov 2018?,btohqsg
income assessment for grant is it during signing of LOA?,btohqsg
I can't remember is it during selection exercise or signing LOA,btohqsg
During selection exercise  thereafter they will inform the results nearer to the signing for LOA.,btohqsg
Once they approve  the grant will be automatically credited to your CPF OA,btohqsg
So there is no reassessment of grant,btohqsg
Anyone still waiting for SBF results?,btohqsg
they mentioned by end of dec right? ><,btohqsg
I believe shld be arnd 4 Jan that date  since applications closed on Nov 23 and sbf results take 6 weeks to release,btohqsg
but their email and letter mentioned within dec ><,btohqsg
let's wait and see is it out at 10am,btohqsg
31st eve of New year already,btohqsg
Erm guys waiting for sbf ballot number,btohqsg
Mine is 20 bigger then supply flats. 😂,btohqsg
Like 50 flats my number 70,btohqsg
So i have to pray people infront of me dont want.,btohqsg
Well if 5000 and yes 5020 got chance.,btohqsg
Nevertheless I truly wish u huaaaat,btohqsg
SBF ballot number came through :D,btohqsg
Keep posted! Wish u huaaaat too,btohqsg
Did you get any queue number,btohqsg
we got queue number 60 out of 194 available units,btohqsg
it's great! now just need to worry about the HLE hahaha,btohqsg
yeah it's a good problem to have haha,btohqsg
for those who get queue numberu guys opt for how many rm flat?,btohqsg
I opt for 4 room in Yishun! Got a queue number 13!,btohqsg
I only got afew ideal ones. Unless im super lucky,btohqsg
This is more exciting then waiting for ur 4d number. 😂,btohqsg
mine failed to get queue number T_T,btohqsg
thus curious..u guys bid how many rm flat and which area.><,btohqsg
woah nice! we'll be neighbors soon hahaha,btohqsg
ur number also very near sia,btohqsg
but my mum only wants high floor which has like 7 units,btohqsg
Any one know the next Sfb?,btohqsg
I havent receive any email for the ballot number 😞,btohqsg
Ok nvm i just saw HAHAH,btohqsg
seems like a good news response! CONGRAT,btohqsg
how many rm unit and where ar?,btohqsg
yishun seems like easier ah?earlier got 2 of them also yishun,btohqsg
When is the selection exercise starting so late,btohqsg
My last sbf also same. Nov sbf april then select,btohqsg
is it stay in yishun ballot for yishun easier to get good queue number?,btohqsg
I guess so since it's a non mature estate,btohqsg
unless you are using the MCPS whereby your parents stay at yishun,btohqsg
Not really I suppose. For this SBF Yishun was hardly subscribed since the beginning. It only ticked to 1.0 application rate on the day before the application closes so it's a sure-get situation for first-timers.,btohqsg
Oh so you don’t stay in yishun too?,btohqsg
will be much easier if my mum is not fussy on the level of the unit,btohqsg
Great note to end this miserable year,btohqsg
How many high floor units are there and what level does your define high floor as,btohqsg
I stay at yishun la so I have the proximity priority. That's probably why the number is good but nonetheless it's sure-get lah for those who chose Yishun SBF,btohqsg
Ah i see! I’m using MCPS though and this is my fourth time balloting. it’s always out of queue or last twenty for unit selection even after waiting for one year to refresh. ):so i’m wondering what can i to gain higher chance. i guess gov don’t encourage us to stay near parents anymore  because they will do our job in supporting our parents for us when they in need of help such as bring them to see doctor when they sick etc. was looking at the convenience for future purposes since both our parents stay yishun but i guess balloting other non mature estate seems to be a better choice );,btohqsg
nonetheless thankyou all for the prompt replies! 🥰,btohqsg
There could be other factors too I suppose. We live nearby and we are new parents so the chances are naturally higher?,btohqsg
So if there are many new parents applying as first-timers then it definitely affects your ballot number,btohqsg
above #11  for 47sqm think they are 3 or 4 units nia,btohqsg
Curious to know more about govt scheme to bring elderly for appointment.,btohqsg
Recently saw the new interior design in MyNiceHome Gallery. Is this the gate we will be getting at Canberra Vista?,btohqsg
I know that is why I am asking whether anyone knows what is the gate design. Anyone knows?,btohqsg
Hi  my BTO for sembawang 3 rm on November queue no 156  the unit only 84. Is there still got chance to book a flat?,btohqsg

Is first timer and second timer queue no together?,btohqsg
Hi ! Can anyone send me the link for this page ? I forgot how to go into this page 😅,btohqsg

my mother prefers a sea view  punggol has it but then the air from pasir gudang side is not totally clean too  otherwise it'd be a nice place for her to retire for good,btohqsg
I mean if she ballot for Northshore side,btohqsg
I got 12/77 for punggol but balcony units only got 7-8 units 🤔,btohqsg
Maybe can invest in a good air purifier? Etc,btohqsg
Thats what i intend to do haha,btohqsg
I didn’t get any number Haish,btohqsg
Welll. My number isnt very good either.,btohqsg
Anyw happy new year to everyone 😊,btohqsg

Hello everyone ... Any of u getting at fernvale glades?,btohqsg
hi ppl  do you think since woodleigh village may delay up to 9 month (s)  will the rest of the projects also delay up to 9 month (s) or only selected projects??,btohqsg
Thus far my Jurong West Jewel BTO will be completed on the probable completion date as stipulated.... But other projecs were apparently delayed for about 5-9 months unfortunately...,btohqsg
So for projects stating delayed up to 9 months for example   only max up to 9 months or still have chances of being extended ?,btohqsg
Able to ask u guysUsually HLE takes how long to process?,btohqsg
Less than a week if u provide all the required document,btohqsg
If approved  they will send another sms to inform?,btohqsg
But u can check the hdb portal for update too,btohqsg
The portal usually update faster than sms,btohqsg
Usually you can review the amount immediately  and will receive the notification in 1~3 days.,btohqsg
OkayHdb is under server maintenance as can’t load it,btohqsg

Ya! I saw left like 2 levels only! But thats like 2 levels EACH. And the interior and exterior also omg,btohqsg
I also got receive email regarding the delay,btohqsg
Hopefully no delays ah. Or on time,btohqsg
The delay email sent out abit late tho. Few months after start work again 😂,btohqsg
I really hope those that don’t show delay now won’t show delay in the future....,btohqsg
So much for wanting ppl to settle now and set up families,btohqsg
Thought bto in May 2018 wont wait so long  in the end.. still have to wait the full length of time,btohqsg
Usually collect keys is a few months before actual date.... but now the chances of getting keys earlier seem impossible,btohqsg

Hello can I know what's the requirement for fiancee scheme ?,btohqsg
Is it a must to stay near parents for fiance/fiancee scheme  in order to apply ?,btohqsg
Hello! Are you asking about the application scheme reflected at the end?,btohqsg
For that  it will be reflected as public scheme  fiance/fiancee scheme is also written as public scheme,btohqsg
But they didn't allow me to choose under fiancee scheme or anything,btohqsg
Must be 21yrs old and above,btohqsg
Anyone here applying for feb 2021 bto?,btohqsg
As long as you put the co applicant as fiance fiancee under the relationship to main applicant column,btohqsg
As long as you put it that way  it is considered as fiance fiancee scheme  just that at the end it will be reflected as public scheme,btohqsg
Oh I see ! Okay thanks alot !!,btohqsg
Are there any priorities in fiancee scheme?,btohqsg
If there is at least 1 first timer between you 2  there will be 1 additional ballot chance,btohqsg
The fiance fiancee scheme is to ensure that you are able to apply for a flat  because not everyone can get a HDB/BTO,btohqsg
hougang BTO of Aug is darn good,btohqsg
hi everyone  i'm interested in getting a flat at bukit batok's west hill. on the site  there are two layout ideas for the 4 room flats im aiming for.which is the default layout of the home or am I able to pick the layout once i pick my unit?,btohqsg
they will show you the block plan soon!,btohqsg
Depends on which one you are looking at  like the blocks,btohqsg
the difference should be the household shelter,btohqsg
should be different block  different unit types,btohqsg
ahhh  so depending on which units/blocks I manage to book then I'll get my preferred floor plan?,btohqsg
Depends on where your door faces!,btohqsg
Hi  any one has idea with this  bto  flat attached  balcony to sell? Still  available  in HDB,btohqsg

@Lilprin3wow  thank you   how do you get to know  this? I can't  find  information  of  new bto on Feb,btohqsg
You see the part I circle like got one protruding rectangle? That’s the balcony,btohqsg
@Lilprin3once  again  thank you.  Only  in Park edge? Other  place  in Feb available?,btohqsg
I see a lot  protruding   that's  mean many flats with  balcony,btohqsg
@Lilprin34-room in Park edge  got  balcony?,btohqsg
Why the flat with balcony  so expensive?,btohqsg
Both 4 and 5 also got balcony  that’s why the sqm is 96 instead of 93. Price also higher  I only know bdd have balcony,btohqsg
good luck for feb 2021 bto ballot!!!!,btohqsg
Thanks every one..I really  like balcony 😌,btohqsg
Good lah if you are willing to pay more,btohqsg
xwthank you.  Any renovation  of bto already ?like  cabinets..how is the toilet  condition? Any information  about  it?,btohqsg
if can pay 5% then better,btohqsg
accrued interest kicks in once your OA is used,btohqsg
I downpaid 3 years ago and the AI is $1500 for $22k of payment,btohqsg
the longer your 2nd appointment is  the better so to delay the interest compute,btohqsg
personally  my AI is about $500 each year before my new house gets TOP,btohqsg
why so ganjiong to sign the LOA,btohqsg
you can use the money to invest  to gain more $ during the next few years,btohqsg
To qualify for HDB loan   have to work consecutively 3 months   while 1 year for taking grant,btohqsg
It's OK as long as your SO is working  maximise the grant amount,btohqsg
it's best to look for job only after they granted you the grant amount,btohqsg
In short  pay 5% first  pay the rest when you get the keys,btohqsg
You can use cash to pay instead if your cash is gao gao,btohqsg
Since theres no better interest from the banks compare to CPF,btohqsg
Do you guys have some latest bto pic ?,btohqsg
You pay more  your AI accumulates more,btohqsg
Why pay more when you only have to pay 5%,btohqsg
not as if you downpay more  you'd have a cheaper rate,btohqsg
Drag as long as possible lol,btohqsg
As long as your partner is working  of course not asking you not to work but at least after the selection exercise?,btohqsg
CPF is like a bank  how much OA you are going to use  the gahmen charges you for the interest  2.5%,btohqsg
Like my mum who used $130k of her OA and the AI accumulated to $55k in 13 years,btohqsg
Which means if she never used it at all  the $55k would be given by the gahmen as interest for that 13 years,btohqsg
Many people are not aware of this,btohqsg
Think ultimately it depends on whether you intend to sell your house or not. if you are very sure you won't sell your house in the future  this accrued interest shouldn't make a difference to you.,btohqsg
Doesn't the accrued interest go into your cpf anyway?,btohqsg
I think it's trying to say if you pay 5% now and another 5% let's say 4 years later  as compared to pay 10% now. Your that second 5% would earn you extra interest over the next 4 years,btohqsg
"What you lose is ""opportunity cost""",btohqsg
When you sell your house  CPF that you have used  SHOULD have been earning interest.,btohqsg
but since you used it to pay for your house  it got taken out of CPF and didn't earn interest.,btohqsg
So accrued interest means the interest that the amount of CPF you put into paying for the house would have earned.,btohqsg
Actually  you're putting the money back. not the govt.,btohqsg
Your cpf is supposed to get an interest.if you use it to pay for the house  its not inside your cpf earning interest.if you sell your house  you have to put in the amount of cpf that you've used  PLUS the interest that it should have earned throughout the years.,btohqsg
almost there. the cpf grows in your account. if you pay 10%  it means taking the money from the cpf account  which means no growing.,btohqsg
It is better to leave ur cpf money in cpf than to pay off as much as you can to hdb because cpf interest is up to 5% while hdb is 2.6%,btohqsg
So only pay hdb when hdb ask you to pay,btohqsg
AI is still your money afterall. The only thing is  you will get lesser cash when you sell your house. Because you need to put the AI to your cpf,btohqsg
"Yeah  i think painting it as ""giving back to the government"" is a little skewed.",btohqsg
Technically you're paying to future you.,btohqsg
Basically cpf is for retirement. So plan your wisely.,btohqsg
Best if you have cold hard cash to pay instead of using your OA,btohqsg
But that's if you can't earn more than 2.5% of interest elsewhere,btohqsg
OA =2.5% VS banks@below 2% (except maybank with constant rate at 3%),btohqsg
But since you're not thinking to sell your BTO  then don't worry about the AI,btohqsg
"Hey guys! Just wanna ask.. Am I able to change one of the applicant from ""occupier"" to ""co-applicant"" without cancelling our BTO application 😢",btohqsg
Yes you can email hdb with your application number..,btohqsg
accrued interest is the amount u need to pay back into your OA account when u sell away your unit. If HDB loan  IIRC 2.6%.So if you withdraw $100k from OA  next year if you sell (just e.g. min 3-5 yrs occupancy) U need to return $102 600 to your OA account. Than don't forget your monthly contribution to pay your HDB loan for that year  e.g. $1000 per month. So capital from OA $112 000 and multiply 2.6% per year.After compounding  the amount is going to be scary if you take 20-30 years loan. As long you don't sell and upgrade  it will be fine.,btohqsg
any of you waiting to collect keys of any of the above projects?,btohqsg
would like to ask the credibility of the progression in %,btohqsg
The percentage behind all these progress is based on a formula algorithm. It's not accurate if you compare with the existing construction progress of the yet finished projects,btohqsg
Hi guys  if theres any update on your projects due to covid19  appreciate if you contribute to us so we can update accordingly to provide more accurate estimated T.O.P date to the community 👍Happy chinese new year to all! 😊,btohqsg
Hi guys  accrued interest will starts when ehg grant deducted on 2nd appointment?,btohqsg
2nd appointment aka signing of LOA,btohqsg
I no grant but once your OA is deducted  AI starts to compute,btohqsg

Hi there anyone know on the status of Northshore straits view?,btohqsg
for ulu pandan  probably the most expensive plot among all,btohqsg
my guess is $550k onwards for 4rm,btohqsg
can't be cheaper than mcnair heights  Feb BTO launch,btohqsg
Anyone knows When will result of Feb bto be out ?,btohqsg
4 weeks after the closing of application,btohqsg
hottest plot under non mature Estate  a stop away to nex and serangoon interchange,btohqsg
think that was the last BTO project of hougang  6 years back,btohqsg
got kovan hawker behind  got heartland mall with cold storage though you have to walk to the other end for NTUC  can just cross over to those cafe houses  cross the other side to jiak teochew porridge  etc,btohqsg
oh those stacks facing away from the mall should have nice unblock view too,btohqsg
omg sudden flashback of my sch days at serangoon sec,btohqsg
the kovan one is epic launch sia,btohqsg
don't worry about nothing to eat,btohqsg
can walk a bit to the stretch of eateries,btohqsg
day time can visit those cafe,btohqsg
as well as the hawker center  then got McDonald's  KFC  old Chang kee  etc,btohqsg
imo  it's even better than bidadari,btohqsg

ooo does anyone know February BTO when will the results be out? heh,btohqsg
Canberra Vista on 15 Feb 2031,btohqsg
Jus curious  I have met a couple of IDs and they mentioned that the highest level unit has a higher ceiling. To my understanding  all levels are prefabricated to a standard size. How is it possible that the top level is higher?Can someone shed some light on this?,btohqsg
during MOP can apply another BTO? so dont have to waste years   anyone knows ?,btohqsg
Seems older hdb yes  newer gen no more. I tried search around online but no firm answer too. Some people asked HDB staff they said same height but after moved in found really 20-30cm higher than other level,btohqsg
So what's considered as old hdb and the recent people who moved in found 20-30cm higher?,btohqsg
No idea. The last i saw on this topic was written in 2017. Anyone who moved in recent may b can help clarify this.,btohqsg
only for those staying on top,btohqsg
So the top floor for all the BTOs have been newly built recently has their top floor 20-30cm higher?,btohqsg
As in for those BTOs built in recent years from 2016 till today?,btohqsg
don't think too much of what I said  I was merely referring to only those who stay on top know how high is the ceiling,btohqsg
I actually wan to know too this the main reason i opt for top floor. But after i chose my unit only realize new build bto now seems no more has this “privilege”. Hope someone can help clarify.,btohqsg
New bto all standard height already no more higher ceiling for top floor only old flats den have,btohqsg
Tat is oldrule.nowall have to finished mop of 5 yrs b4 u can apply bto.u can try submit bto application it will be denied n ur 10 dollars will be eaten up,btohqsg
just $10 nia  poh poh your luck,btohqsg
Top level and level below seems different,btohqsg
this page giving really value of your house?,btohqsg
can try with your yet to TOP address,btohqsg
the way I see it  looks like the top floor has higher ceiling,btohqsg
👍🏻👍🏻 but it seems like some residents have said it which makes sense too  whereby it contains additional beams to support the water tanks,btohqsg
The should be actual height. The TOP require water proof and heavy loan space,btohqsg
May i know where you found this info?,btohqsg
Under the new rule now if your flat haven't reach the mop n u apply bto even if u send in ur application ur application will be block.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/selling-a-flat/eligibility,btohqsg
Oh sorry i was refer to wrong topic,btohqsg
I actually wan refer to this,btohqsg
Does all current BTO given completion delay notice by HDB? I had received my bto delay by 9 mths.,btohqsg
How come my bto (Tampines greendew) in status can drop from 80 plus % to 71% in BTOHQ after they indicated may delay by 9mths.By i look at the actual progress there is not too much of delay.😀,btohqsg
take it that  as long as dont get key is 0% lor  once take key is 100% complete lor,btohqsg
Hi Thomas! You recieved an email regards to the 9mths delay by HDB?,btohqsg
I mean you got receive any email? Haha,btohqsg
https://www.btohq.com/development-progress/bto/tampines-greendewThere's updated development images here 👍,btohqsg
Yes i received the 9 mths delay notice by HDB. Does all bto received the notice? Or standard practice to give to all bto applicants?,btohqsg
Some received 6 mths  some received 3 mths  but different projects,btohqsg
oops just realised I'm no longer admin lol,btohqsg
The upcoming august hougang bto really attractive 😂 kept thinking about it all day,btohqsg
hi. i'm a newbie here. wonder at what percentage can we start collecting keys?,btohqsg
Did you receive any email from hdb regarding any delay?,btohqsg
Mine’s at 100% now also still haven’t receive letter leh 🥺,btohqsg
wow 8 BTO projects are 100% completed,btohqsg
the weird thing is  my colleague moved in to AMK Court in the starting of the year,btohqsg
when the project is shown at 100% recently,btohqsg
if it takes 2 weeks to complete 1%  means he already shifted in upon like 96% of progression of his BTO,btohqsg
which means maybe some of the residents of your project have already shifted in,btohqsg
but we went down to see  it doesn't look like 100% complete though~ hahaha,btohqsg
yeah so weird.. but thanks for sharing.. hope we'll receive our letters very soon! 🥺,btohqsg
same for Matilda Sundeck. it is still construction in progress  but its saying 100% on the website,btohqsg
but the cranes are all removed and water tank all installed. so i guess it's left with finishing touches,btohqsg
hope to receive letter in March :/,btohqsg
which year BTO launch was it from?,btohqsg
mine may 2017 and at 93% according to BTOHQ,btohqsg
but the location is really ulu  fine if you drive otherwise have to walk so far for transit,btohqsg
Can see if TOP has been issued,btohqsg
Ya some blocks are already done,btohqsg
Then key collection is batch by batch,btohqsg
They might submit for TOP by by blocks and release block by block also. After TOP hdb still need to check,btohqsg
If u see this the playground just TOP but blocks were TOP long ago,btohqsg
So some might see 100%  havent collect key. Cos hdb release in batches de,btohqsg
yeah I have checked the BCA website and the TOP was issued in January though the progress bar is shown at 100% on BTOHQ recently,btohqsg
Than still need few weeks bah to months,btohqsg
Some also might see 95% collect keys haha,btohqsg
but once TOP issued  means can get keys right,btohqsg
See how the contractor want to submit for TOP,btohqsg
14 more weeks to go for me,btohqsg
Hi can I just ask your est date of completion is in June?,btohqsg
I think two months prior to key collection you will be informed about it,btohqsg

Hi!Seeking your kind opinion. Should I and my partner BTO or purchase resale?Our total income doesn’t give us any BTO grants plus the waiting time of 5 years. We’re currently renting  so rental cost is a factor too while waiting. Resale on the other hand not very cheap.Given our situation  any helpful points or comments for us?Many thanks!!,btohqsg
Ooh that’s something new! Let me check it out. Thank you 😊,btohqsg

Hello  may i check  my husband will be going away overseas for a month (plus quarantine it’s 6-7 weeks) he’ll be away to be exact. On the BTO page it states that our project is 100% completed so we’re afraid we’ll receive the letter for collection of key when he’s away. Can anyone advise what he need to do or prepare so that i can collect it on behalf of both of us?,btohqsg
I read up on hdb that we need a solicitor to prepare a POA but im guessing we need costs to that and what if we didn’t receive hdb better during time while he’s away- then waste money😂,btohqsg
Will probably call in on Monday for more info.,btohqsg

BTO sure affordable  sure make money when sell after MOP  but the wait.... zzzzzzzzzzzzz,btohqsg
there are several mechanisms in place to prevent people form gaming the system. eg.- young couples got time to wait  but not enough money- older folks  got money to buy expensive units  but no time to wait.- on top of these considerations  some lower units are built with balcony  tall units without. location alsoall in all  whatever good that buyers can think of  HDB would have put a restrainer to it,btohqsg
Hi All! Happy Monday! :)Would like to ask if anyone has any idea when with the SBF exercise for May 2021 commence? Thanks!,btohqsg

bro  when was these pics taken?,btohqsg
a bunch of monkeys are always there  right below the estate,btohqsg
I nearly kena attack as I was holding a plastic big,btohqsg
"yeah  got residents go there take pics  kena ""robbed""",btohqsg
I wanted to make a big detour but was held back by those monkeys,btohqsg
so my wife and I uturn,btohqsg
not to hold any plastic bag next time if we are going for some stroll,btohqsg
we saw a baby monkey really so small and cute  but once the parent saw us getting closer  a few of them on alert mode and walking towards us  the baby went to the parent who then hugged him  so cute and warming,btohqsg
they could think that u wanna attack them,btohqsg
I held my stuffs high up  the monkey stay out and stared at the items,btohqsg
but in any case  really appreciate the pics bro,btohqsg
nothing lah  just 2 shots nia,btohqsg
Yah  do not show your teeth to the monkey. Even if we are smiling  baring teeth is a sign of aggression for the monkeys.,btohqsg
What do u guys think abt staying near the bin n lift area?,btohqsg
lift area means exposed to every outsider with the main door opened,btohqsg
but also the first to reach home,btohqsg
don't have to walk along your neighbours' houses to the lift,btohqsg
I have to walk past 4 houses to the lift,btohqsg
Wow thank you! Nv thought of this before hahaa.. but mine not directly outside the lift  so not too bad,btohqsg
Hi all do you know if there are a y units still for sale at waterway sunrise 1 / 2,btohqsg
Ivan Ong  any more available units do u know ? Do I go direct to HDB ? But this project delayed till 2023?,btohqsg
put into perspective of outsider and residents,btohqsg
oops SBF for punggol no info yet,btohqsg
should be the same opening as BTO,btohqsg
Yup. 2 days ago. I'm juz a short distance away from the bin. But at a corner. Should be fine ba,btohqsg
As long the bin is not directly infront of your door should be okay. Do people need to pass by your unit to throw rubbish? If u got inconsiderate neighbour then your doorstep will be dirty,btohqsg
"i open my main door  straight away face the 2 dustbin  head on. they face me  my main door face them  right in the eye.but apparently  HDB is building a wall with ""angled fins"" for light and ventilation due to fire safety requirements.",btohqsg
Hello does anyone know roughly when the feb 2021 results will be out,btohqsg
at this rate  i dun think HDB can catch up with the new BTO projects. They already whining on the news about the dropout rates LOL,btohqsg
those units that are supposed to be picked by the dropout ones and if left unpicked  are to be ended up as SBF and then OBF,btohqsg
normally within 4 weeks after the application is closed,btohqsg
when did the application of BTO Feb closed ah?,btohqsg
then it should be out soon by this week,btohqsg
I'm like one house away to the bin,btohqsg
Yaaa. The direction will be quite windy,btohqsg
As long in front no blockage  and facing North/South  it will be very windy during year end til Feb,btohqsg
I'm clueless on wind sun direction,btohqsg
but no 1 criteria for me upon unit selection  pick one with the nicest scenery,btohqsg
HiCan anyone suggest me   recently one of my friends has applied for nov SBF 2020 but his application was unsuccessful like no ballot direct unsuccessful so May I know what it could be the reason ? Like is it very common or something else,btohqsg
why would you think his application should be successful?,btohqsg
Coz as first timer married couple then applied near to parents house both working,btohqsg
They won't make a loss.. Because they get back the grant plus the interest..,btohqsg
some contributed $100+ still can't get it,btohqsg
I think HDB should change the name from (BTO) build to order to BTA ( build to anyways) coz this nothing to do with order Liao ..😐,btohqsg
I very lucky.  I got it first time apply.. my ballot 🗳 number was over the expected requirement units,btohqsg
I applied 3x  was lucky to tio everytime,btohqsg
then trying for mature estate on the 3rd time since it is much nearer to work,btohqsg
After selection of unit (first appointment) how long hdb will get back to you for the second appointment? After I selected a unit last December until now no news from hdb.,btohqsg
Anyone heard or know  will HDB release keys to owner for the completed block or HDB will wait for the whole project to complete then release the keys.,btohqsg
Soon. U may want to call them and check. U need to pay the 10%,btohqsg
Tried calling  either too busy to answer or they will direct me to the sales line which will disengage After a few rings.,btohqsg
Log in to your my hdb portal. And check or email them. They are quite fast. Should be soon. When come to  Payment  $ they are very fast .,btohqsg
Me too waiting for 2nd appointment . They said 4-9 months 🤷🏽‍♀️,btohqsg
Btw 2nd appointment need make payment for 5-10% rite via cpf ?,btohqsg
the longer the better  no need worry since you have already booked the unit,btohqsg
accrued interest starts to compute the moment you signed for your LOA,btohqsg
yes but 5% if any of you is below 30yo,btohqsg
So after the 2nd appoint the they will inform us when when is the final pcd?,btohqsg
hard to inform you one because there are uncertainty,btohqsg
just count as 3 years after 2nd appointment,btohqsg
maybe 4 years after 2nd appointment,btohqsg
those who are waiting to be called up for 2nd appointment  you want to pay accrued interest so early ah?,btohqsg
I paid 3 years ago  still waiting for TOP and my AI accumulated $1500 already,btohqsg
That’s why they didn’t applied in mature estates coz they know cannot get one but even applied in non mature still unsuccessful,btohqsg
yes I reckon kovan will be oversubscribed 99,btohqsg
if my mum didn't get her unit this SBF  she's going to ballot for May macpherson and kovan in Aug too,btohqsg
few steps to MRT/hawker/heartland mall  walk further down to shophouses/Cross opposite to row of cafes  cross the other side to row of eateries,btohqsg
if you're going to lor ah soo in a rainy day  don't have to bring umbrella  all sheltered as there are buses looping,btohqsg
In fact august alot good plots,btohqsg
kovan is the best location for non mature estate,btohqsg
better than bidadari in terms of amenities,btohqsg
my guess for the starting price of 4r is 350k,btohqsg
My guess is 380k cause near mrt also,btohqsg
But no one knows till launch,btohqsg
Woodlands Central starts from $306 000 on 2nd floor,btohqsg
the price of BTO depends on the surrounding transactions of resale too,btohqsg
Yup and woodlands has the lowest median always,btohqsg
Mine 337 800 + 10 000 (wife PR) on a 6th level😚,btohqsg
So kovan cfm much more $,btohqsg
306k might be the resale pricing of 3r,btohqsg

can see those transaction prices of hougang blk 21x massionette,btohqsg

buying houses is all about location,btohqsg

7 units on each level except roof garden,btohqsg
5 x 5 rooms and 2 x 4 rooms☺️,btohqsg
Sorry for sending so many pictures,btohqsg
too bad my good friend had no chance to get his 3r at woodlands,btohqsg
Limited only around 144 x 3 rooms,btohqsg
his wife is Malaysian PR  sure make life much easier if they were to be balloted,btohqsg
All units at Woodlands all being selected,btohqsg
those who have failed to get BTO/SBF  maybe you have chance getting the greater Southern waterfront flats,btohqsg
Best is to buy flats that are located next to MRT  that normally means it is next to shopping malls though not all,btohqsg
Photo from WONG LEK FU (黄历富),btohqsg
agreed no other better plot in woodlands liai,btohqsg
