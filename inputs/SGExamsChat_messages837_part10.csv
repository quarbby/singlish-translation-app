I had a strict no game policy on my ipad until i discovered cookie run kingdom,btohqsg
Its like cookie run with rpg,btohqsg
Oh he finally broke his attention,btohqsg
I dont understand anything this dude been talkin since 1030,btohqsg
speaking of  i did the quiz practice then sent it into your cohort grp btw if you didn’t see,btohqsg
Much appreciated for inflating the bell curve,btohqsg
tbh i’m just trying to help some of yall over the finish line,btohqsg
Because this qm2 thing is actually killing me,btohqsg
Atp i dont even care what grade i get,btohqsg
4 mid terms and i failed all 4,btohqsg
i failed my y3 mods wheeeee,btohqsg
after i get back from my conference ill grind qm2 with you,btohqsg
i’m not sure why it’s only on this specific telegram channel where i keep getting into arguments,btohqsg
i didn’t have the same issue in sge discord,btohqsg
i’m not trying to argue. i’m just saying it as is,btohqsg
you’re free to have your own pov,btohqsg
So you just want people to agree with you? Alright MI sucks ig its true,btohqsg
RP sucks that's like a fact,btohqsg
where is caleb soh when u need him,btohqsg
But like what u gain from that fact is a separate issue,btohqsg
no i just want to be understood,btohqsg
right now i feel like i’m the only person who has a horrible experience in mi despite everyone else attending the same classes as me and having the same schedules,btohqsg
Nobody is denying your experience. But from what you are talking about  is that youre expecting more from MI than it already is. Its like i go to ITE expecting a MIT education. That's just not how it is. Its unfair. Its injustice. But thats just how the way it is,btohqsg
But it doesnt mean that MI is shit. Its just not what youre expecting. Its fine.,btohqsg
You know it's just like how I was not expecting amusical for the new Joker Movie,btohqsg
Why bother being unhappy about things outside your control when you can just get the As cert and then gtfo,btohqsg
Fak i was gonna watch it,btohqsg
your experience is always valid but you can form a ton of different conclusions from the same experience,btohqsg
Why put Lady Gaga if u aren't gonna make her sing like gaga,btohqsg
I WANT YOUR LOVE I WANT YOUR REVENGE,btohqsg
look  your experiences is valid  and I've had friend who have had horrible experiences in MI too.at the same time  I want to hear your experience  not about how the management is shit and other schools will be btr. nobody here can change management  yapping about that's not gna change anything.,btohqsg
YOU AND ME COULDVE A BAD ROMANCEEE,btohqsg
"I stand here waiting for you to bang the gongTo crash the critic saying  ""Is it right or is it wrong?""If only fame had an I.V  baby could I bear?Being away from you  I found the vein  put it in hereI live for the applause  applause  applauseI live for the applause-plause  live for the applause-plause  live for the-Way that you cheer and scream for meThe applause  applause  applause",btohqsg
ngl it’s like how people always shit on ntu management (for valid reasons) but then you go any country any uni,btohqsg
they always got their own issues,btohqsg
bc the only perspective they have is their own uni,btohqsg
cough sim uol where the hell is my course videos,btohqsg
I mean u can shit on NTU management but like if u don't have a plan then it's just pissing into the wind,btohqsg
(i say it as if its not a remod and i can go into my past mods i took to watch lmaos),btohqsg
my friend is in TUM for masters now and she was bewildered at how germany handles some of their admin side,btohqsg
i guess blaming isn’t the answer,btohqsg
It is. U just gotta know who to blame sometimes it's yourself,btohqsg
Like we get your frustration  really. But blaming wont change anything  might as well channel that energy somewhere else to make a change,btohqsg
I have been wonderingwho is the joker in the new movie but when the screen turn to black and I see my reflection I realised the true joker is me for paying money to see this shit,btohqsg
that's why I'm still in this chat tbh,btohqsg
i’m just here to occasionally drop one liners to ppl that deserve it,btohqsg
blaming myself isn’t going to get me anywhere either,btohqsg
well if blaming yourself -> motivation to work on it,btohqsg
