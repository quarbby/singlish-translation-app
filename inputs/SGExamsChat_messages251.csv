The one who got dump by Kim ?,btohqsg
In my personal opinion  there were some highlights but in overall it's not that amazing.,btohqsg
808s & Heartbreak 2  let's go,btohqsg
But Taylor swift incident was a real joke,btohqsg
How could you be so heartless?,btohqsg
He got dumped by kim and hooked up with some girl,btohqsg
the girl got some powers siol,btohqsg
Well  we should write actual bars or something,btohqsg
I feel motivated to write a 16,btohqsg

Have you heard the song Butter:)?,btohqsg
I know it’s out but haven’t HAHAHA,btohqsg
I’m still stuck on life goes on and love myself,btohqsg
Haha Life Goes On and V's Song in the album which I forgotten is still my favorite.,btohqsg
I recommend that you should:). Not too bad.,btohqsg
theyre ✨ a w e s o m e ✨,btohqsg
Yes Mafia in the morning 😍,btohqsg
Search up shoot and call me by my name,btohqsg
Call me by name - snow Kong   the9 girl group in ChinaShoot - itzySounds exact same   and guess what ?Snows song came out first,btohqsg
most of the time it isnt copying,btohqsg
along with taylor swift  dua lipa and olivia rodrigo,btohqsg
nicki  doja and megan queens of rap ☺️,btohqsg
Yes  I'm a fan of The Weeknd.,btohqsg
im still quite new to the fandom,btohqsg
Well  listen to the re-release of House of Balloons to understand his original sound.,btohqsg
Alternative R&B was never the same after that,btohqsg
Didn't the last one just release her first album a few weeks ago?,btohqsg
i rlly love the save your tears remix,btohqsg
Personally  I would consider her the queen of Pop-R&B rather than the queen of Pop.,btohqsg
they also performed it at the iHeart awards and it was AWESOMEEEE,btohqsg
true. shes soing more rnb now,btohqsg
I really liked all 3 collaborations between the Weeknd and Ariana Grande,btohqsg
What's your favourite album from her?,btohqsg
but imo positions and thank u next are the only skipless albums,btohqsg
altho i love sweetener and dw more,btohqsg
"Well  ""Thank You  Next"" is my favourite album from her given how I really like the aesthetics and cohesiveness of the entire LP.",btohqsg
Which is really what I prefer from an album.,btohqsg
Who actually sings/sang the national anthem proudly in school during morning assembly?,btohqsg
National anthem > cardi b's entire discography,btohqsg
yes!! the album goes together really well,btohqsg
please  cardi doesnt have a career,btohqsg
Didn't she only have one album?,btohqsg
Any song that he recommended > everything else,btohqsg
I'm not so sure all I know is that xxl didn't put her on their freshman list cos they thought she was gonna do tv,btohqsg
If being a provocateur is a career...,btohqsg
its natural for me to kinda hate cardi,btohqsg
Well  she's just annoying in my opinion,btohqsg
her songs are actually not too bad  but i dislike her as a person,btohqsg
I prefer artists (rappers) who really keep quiet and show that their albums are really good when they release it.,btohqsg
Any artists nowadays can blow up with a single,btohqsg
One excellent album every 3 years > 5 subpar singles every month,btohqsg
Yet  can you sustain a fanbase over multiple quality projects?,btohqsg
An EP per month  oh goodness,btohqsg
I'm not discrediting her skills and talent but really I much prefer other rappers who rather show it in their music,btohqsg
Like Megan Thee Stallion right now,btohqsg
If she has talent then I'm not seeing it,btohqsg
If annoying sounding flows are your thing  sure. Apparently that's a talent right now.Although  I would agree with you that I'm not really impressed by that.,btohqsg
Nah not really my thing most rappers these days use the same flows,btohqsg
Which is why I've been digging old school rappers mainly,btohqsg
Those from the 80s and 90s,btohqsg
The Sugarhill Gang  70s  let's go!,btohqsg
The whole album was kinda interesting not a lot of people do jazz hip hop,btohqsg
Well  that's when Hip-Hop started after all!,btohqsg
Yeah  I really like the sounds of it.,btohqsg
He has the best rap album of all timeWe all know which one,btohqsg
Then he fell off after that,btohqsg
To be fair it's kinda difficult to match illmatic,btohqsg
It was written was still good,btohqsg
"It's not ""difficult""  it's pretty much impossible",btohqsg
But nastradamus...yeah that was a shitshow,btohqsg
Yeah  yet  everything is compared back to illmatic unfortunately,btohqsg
It's not bad  I suppose  yet King's Disease though,btohqsg
He also produced kids see ghosts during those sessions  right?,btohqsg
Yeah as well as K.T.S.E  ye & Daytona,btohqsg
Daytona would be the album of the year for 2018 in my opinion if we consider from a rap puritan perspective,btohqsg
If biggie was still alive everything that he put out will get compared to ready to die,btohqsg
Guess that's the price of putting out one of the greatest rap albums of all time,btohqsg
Do any of u listen to kpop? Esp jonghyun!,btohqsg
HAHA i am trying to learn some of his old songs xD,btohqsg
But I am more of a new KPop fan only joined the K pop wave about 3 years ago,btohqsg
HAHA i learnt end of a day  elevator  lonely  shinin  before our spring... our page by shinee,btohqsg
Old songs is the classic indeed!,btohqsg
Now adays music trends are changing and getting more catchy but I will still miss the old songs,btohqsg
Sounds similar esp for chinese songs,btohqsg
That's why he was ready to die  I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,btohqsg
Yeah  it's the worst form of a one hit wonder,btohqsg
Which is why I have to give major props to outkastAll of their albums can be considered among southern hip hop's finest,btohqsg
Yet  that's technically some movie/show crossover so we can negate that,btohqsg
That flow is just its own league,btohqsg
Aquemini was probably the best rap album of 1998 (tied with it's dark and hell is hot),btohqsg
I enjoyed skew it on the bar b,btohqsg
"does anyone listen to dubstep :""",btohqsg
Does anyone know how to sleep longer ._.,btohqsg
I sleep at 1 and my body clock auto wake me up at 6,btohqsg
it's like sleeping aids helps you to sleep longer can be bought for pharmacy but shouldnt be taken for long term and usually only once a day (before you sleep),btohqsg
Please teach me how you do that  thanks!,btohqsg
Just follow the stress timetable I have,btohqsg
sleep is for the weak rest is for the dead,btohqsg
When I was stress during the first half of the year I just stayed up,btohqsg
Plus lying down just makes u think more,btohqsg
idk i get weird af dreams,btohqsg
i get lucid dreams way too often,btohqsg

I never sleep  cause sleep is the cousin of death.,btohqsg
I see ur shadows in my room~,btohqsg
Idk theres no trigger for me,btohqsg
Yeah  I want to control my dreams where I actually become a cat or something,btohqsg
Oh damn i had thst before. I rmb being small and playing with like yarn and chasing my tail,btohqsg
What if all cats are judt vessels for humans having lucid dreams,btohqsg
didn't know it was something to listen to,btohqsg
sleeping pills need to be prescribed I think can use melatonin and see if it improves if doesnt then yea just go doc get sleeping pills,btohqsg
same I just study lol or play game,btohqsg
Damn people be gettig stressed not studying,btohqsg
when studying feel stressed cause thinking of the 10000 other assignments tests and exams(ofc this is just an exaggeration) when not studying thinking of work,btohqsg
This one may not be a good thing,btohqsg
But if it wakes u up according to,btohqsg
I have thr same issue of waking up at the same timing,btohqsg
Ya this one u nid sleep accordingly,btohqsg
Mine if i sleep @ 5am will act wake me up at 12,btohqsg
If u finish faster the better,btohqsg
I always make myself busy w projects,btohqsg
I usually go for a run,btohqsg
Come back  go through the sleep of the dead,btohqsg
It doesn’t work for me HAHAHA,btohqsg
when i stress i roll into a ball and sleep uwu,btohqsg
Yes  run at Lim Chu Kang,btohqsg

do anyone here have any combined chem tuition recommendations? in urgent need to have one cause i’ve been failing chem all the way,btohqsg
Hmm whats ur main problem in the subject?,btohqsg
best chem tutor is here ^,btohqsg
If is content then u have to read up on ur content using the textbook,btohqsg
Any doubts/problems can always ask the O lvl grp,btohqsg
HAHA though i still do chem now but a bit rusty lah,btohqsg
Unless u rly think its necessary,btohqsg
Might take more time for him/her to understand though... and its alr June,btohqsg
Ok la 4 months enough for o lvls,btohqsg
If a lvls then a bit... cannot,btohqsg
i cant seem to understand what my teacher says in class   not gonna lie about 3/4 the class fail chem in tests& exams lol   i also lack  motivation to study chem nor do i have the attention span to read my textbook,btohqsg
my teacher sort of gave up on my class alr so i really dk what to do   especially when sch is starting in a week,btohqsg
"I dont think the main problem is the teacher (although thats a contributing factor)  but rather your ""lack of motivation and attention span""",btohqsg
So even if you go for tuition  you might see improvements  but it may not be that much if you do not address these main problems,btohqsg
I think the main problem is students or tutors often didn’t manage to troubleshoot the key issue,btohqsg
