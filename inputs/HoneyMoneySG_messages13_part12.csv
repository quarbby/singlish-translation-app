"Have used it before  not very difficult  at home page click ""transfer""  then ""duitnow"" then fill in account number and bank. If details are name name will appear at the next pageIf you deposited funds into GO+ to earn daily returns  you need withdraw from GO+ first before you can do the transfer",btohqsg
If one has CIMB accounts on both sides of the causeway  CIMB is usually better and can transfer larger amounts (TNG limited to max MYR 25k/month and occasionally will have top up issues  Revolut is also subject to 30k annual limit and this will reduce your ability to do other fcy txns). But rates are best only on Mon - Fri  usually 9am to 5pm and excluding PH. Non-residents of Malaysia are also subject to BNM's FEA rules and can only move MYR 10k / day.To pre-check on rates:https://www.cimbclicks.com.sg/sgd-to-myr,btohqsg
I use uob>grab>revolut so have the 1.7 percent spread,btohqsg
Wont be over 25k lol  just casual user,btohqsg
But thank for the advice  good to know,btohqsg
Do u know how long is the transfer process,btohqsg
instant  duitnow is Malaysia's version of PayNow,btohqsg
So faster then cimb sg to cimb malaysia?,btohqsg
but duitnow combines our PayNow + FAST (so you can duitnow to their phone number / mykad  but also duitnow to a bank acc),btohqsg
so it boils down to rates / cashback / convenience,btohqsg
for hsbc revo  anyone can confirm if skyscanner ortrip.comfalls under MCC code 4722 (travel agencies and tour operators)? Thanks!,btohqsg
You cannot promo. As this is his channel,btohqsg
you can actually check with customer support on this  but i think you're right on thishttps://www.whatcard.sg/?amount=5.0&q=trip.com,btohqsg
can ah why not.. been doing this for years,btohqsg
GO+ only for purely malaysians.. not applicable for SG citizen unless you are PR from Msia,btohqsg
Just did a top up to TNG Comparison 10RMInstarem - $3.11 (Rate 3.2154)Revolut - $3.04 (Rate 3.292)Youtrip - $3.08 (Rate 3.2467)Seems like even though i use instarem and pay $3.11 and get 4MPD.This 4MPD will be equivalent to $0.07(12miles).Therefore 1 Mile = $0.00583Is it worth it ?,btohqsg
Youtrip to touch and go app,btohqsg
U can store ringgit in the app,btohqsg
Which card u pair with to get 4MPD on TnG,btohqsg
Ohhhh  btw anyone have the ez link debit wallet acc?if have do y’all know how to withdraw money from there to other platform like grab or etc,btohqsg
I not sure if the foreign currency fee is worth it,btohqsg
Oh but confirm eligible spend huh.. whats the MCC? Because I know TnG mcc can be random at times,btohqsg
I dont have to worry with mcc that way,btohqsg
And i get 1.7 percent cashback on my top up,btohqsg
MCC 4784: Toll and Bridge Fees,btohqsg
Because there are like 3-4 MCCs for tng,btohqsg
With 3.29 rate (today) i get extra 1.7 percent which is extra 5 ringgit,btohqsg
most of my top up is 4784,btohqsg
So the effective rate become 1 sgd to 3.34,btohqsg
I think this is more attractive me then miles,btohqsg
Some prefer milesSome prefer cashbackSee whats your valuation :),btohqsg
My miles card burst every month lol as i use for side biz,btohqsg
Technically.. 4MPD is a tad better than 1.7% cashback,btohqsg
Its about 2.5% cashback worth for 4MPD,btohqsg
There is foreign currency fee by bank,btohqsg
That window might not stay that long,btohqsg
not for years down the road.. what makes u feel Amex and Grab will be in to stay for long also? hehe,btohqsg
It is a corelation between amex and grab,btohqsg
i hope it lasts of course :) i'm highly dependent on it lol..,btohqsg
But actually my spread last time was more when jipay was functional,btohqsg
ezlink cannot transfer to revo / grab / grab anymoreotherwise that was my best option,btohqsg
From uob amex>grab>jipay (during7-10 percent booster)>revolut>tng,btohqsg
if u add ezlink between jipay and revolut  you would have earned more during those times,btohqsg
Jipay nerf those ezlink top up cashback,btohqsg
