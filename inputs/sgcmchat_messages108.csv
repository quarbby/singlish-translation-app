ada tahi cair2 ke tak bro?,btohqsg
Its brenthon. Go get educated on it. It's a thing among Korean cars.,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it just like a stick on badge,btohqsg
why Honda made Acura and why everyone was confused when Volkswagen sold the Phaeton as a VW instead of an Audi. People are obsessively badge and brand conscious  and Brenthon understands this so well they realize all they need to sell is a meaningless brand  and not even a car,btohqsg
The car itself is still and undisputed-ly a Kia or Hyundai. But people change the badge to Brenthon to make it a brenthon  weirdly thats just how it worth. Well at least the logo is nicer than traditional kia and hyundai's,btohqsg
Apart from badges  the company do produces some trims for kias and hyundais. Like dash board trim  stock may be plain black plastic  they've chrome version of the exact same thing. You get the idea.,btohqsg
The newer kia logo is nicer than those of years past,btohqsg
Oh brother went on a rant,btohqsg
Car seems cool I take pic,btohqsg
Actually I haven‚Äôt seen a modified car in like a month or two,btohqsg
