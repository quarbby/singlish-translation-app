any h2 math students can remind me how to do complex numbers again :'),btohqsg
i literally forgot how to do complex HAHHA just need a little push,btohqsg
How do I do such questions again,btohqsg
they alr give you one root so one other root is the complex conjugate,btohqsg
oh wait because all coefficients are real right,btohqsg
thats why the other root is complex conjugate,btohqsg
so you have one pair then the other two is either both real or another conjugate pair,btohqsg
but like you have (z-(3-2i))(z-(3+2i)) as a factor then you can compare coefficients or smth,btohqsg
ok ok i got it from here,btohqsg
