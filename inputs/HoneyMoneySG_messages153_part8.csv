Anyone on android tried to add your Amaze card to a new android phone using Google Pay? I am unable to do so. I contacted their support and they said to try again after 30 DAYS of last attempt...,btohqsg
same issue as you gotten the same reply,btohqsg
if it helps... in recent 1-2 months  my gang has been trying to add Amaze to Applepay and it keeps saying UNABLE TO ADD CARD  PLEASE CONTACT ISSUER.We had successfully added Amaze cards to other humans Applepay when it was formally announced  but recently seems to have issues.We tried all 3 methods:1. manually keying in Amaze card number2. adding from Amaze app3. tap card on phone to addALL CANNOT.,btohqsg
they tried to say it's my personal problem  luckily got community sharing hahaha,btohqsg
ok thanks for the update! will check,btohqsg
This is the real gem. Purple version of amaze added to applepay. Now is the ugly cyan version Liao.,btohqsg

Anyone able to share the T&C for October EGA promo? Doesn‚Äôt seem to receive Dec Everyday+ bonus. Thanks!,btohqsg
I thought iOS 17 limit to 10?,btohqsg
no.. only BEFORE iOS16 (i.e. 15 and earlier) have limit of 16 cards,btohqsg
everyday+ 1% interest is based on incremental mab wrt previous month  separate from the 3.x% bonus interest,btohqsg
51% sure OP just used the wrong term,btohqsg
guys For CRMC + Amaze and when i am going to Shanghai.I had linked my Amaze to Alipay.CRMC activated its overseas usage.Is this the correct setup to use?,btohqsg
Crmc actually dont need overseas if ur using amaze. But yes,btohqsg
thanks.the purpose to pair Amaze is because to use Amaze card via Alipay,btohqsg
The heymax promo no more already ?,btohqsg
How you get your MCST to sign up on AXS?,btohqsg
Check MCC using Amaze blocked card method before plonking down the payment,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see it prompt 50 cents when I pay.. l will check my transaction history shortly,btohqsg
He meant empty amaze wallet method,btohqsg
Pretty sure that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue,btohqsg
Why not just pay in advance so that giro deduction won‚Äôt happen? Then don‚Äôt have to cancel GIRO arrangement. You might have to go back to GIRO again if there‚Äôs no more 2mpd from Choco Visa.,btohqsg
Ah okay  how many days in advance do I make payment for the insurance via axs so that there‚Äôs no double deduction for the particular month?,btohqsg
For GE  at least 2 weeks to be safe.,btohqsg

question on chocolate card paying for insurance if there is this logo and i can't pay thru GE's portal will AXS work?,btohqsg
Hi gurus sorry for asking many times but just wanna check 1 last time before i purchase if there is any card promo now that can beat amex platinum charge in sign up bonus for big purchases?I already used up sign up offers from citibank uob dbs maybank and standard chart,btohqsg
Wow 20k is alot man. Maybe when I need to do even bigger purchase I can look into this. But if I sign up for journey previously  still can apply for beyond?,btohqsg
So i guess if around 8k  amex should be the best option so far?@antonio191203@mttelegrammt,btohqsg
U said big what.Beyond is new to card offer not new to bank.,btohqsg
Sir we mentioned our opinion many times. Time to make your own decisions. No one can justify 1744 AF but you.,btohqsg
Good qns i need to check. Should be ok I think,btohqsg
I understand that. But doesn't it come off as a waste that rarely need to spend 8k  then don't aim for sign up bonus? Since most 4mpd capped at 1 to 2k and can't split the bill across different cards.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the annual fee u need to consider.,btohqsg
You pretty much exhausted everything. Maybe can look at Amex,btohqsg
That said if you are looking at Amex I recommend u look at something like the krisflyer Amex card for NEW to AMEX before signing up for Amex plat charge,btohqsg
Oh why? Can tell me more please üôè,btohqsg
You get the same offer as an existing or new to Amex customer on the AMEX plat charge card. Of course like granny said  u got to see if the AF justifies. (I personally just applied too  but only because I think two luggage and $800 and the status covers whatever I will pay for in my upcoming trips or plans for the year),btohqsg
So apply 2 at the same time?,btohqsg
