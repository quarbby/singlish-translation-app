People let go their flats along the way  thats how SBFs are born,btohqsg
Any idea when results will be out for feb bto?,btohqsg
2 years ago  people chose the high floor unit. Move in  face the same problem as the previous owner. End up surrender flat. Now the high floor unit is back in SBF again.Think positive  you dodged a bullet. ðŸ˜†OrSince that SBF  another owner surrender flat to HDB thus new unit is available in SBF.,btohqsg
What is the problem with the unit?,btohqsg
Maybe fengshui cannot match with owner  stars not alignedðŸ¤­,btohqsg
Maybe break up or never fullfil MOP period or many other reasons,btohqsg
Oh so not unit issue haha,btohqsg
Unit issue u mean what kind of issue?Can't be unit issue right? Everything is being inspected by HDB before handover to owners.Is always owners issue that's why have sbfEven loanshark issue is also consider owners own loanshark $ then move out as a reasons etc...,btohqsg
Like the attributes they donâ€™t like or face rubbish chute those kind lor,btohqsg
Typically people would wait till MOP if its unit issues.. so i guess its more likely divorce and unable to wait till MOP  did something illegal  arrears  etc,btohqsg
I have a question: for recent new owners doing key collection for Bto  does HDB ask for another HFE application? We are asking because when we booked the bto  that time it was HLE not HFE. Not too sure if we are to do HFE soon if we are collecting keys in july.A call to HDB..told us that still need to do HLE. But only by request?,btohqsg
I think if you need reassessment then need to apply new HFE if not i think HLE will be fine,btohqsg
True. Got issue also most people will tahan until mop and cash out. Unless bo bian must let go before mop because hdb rules n take back,btohqsg
Prime location now 10years mop so also must tahan even got neighbour from hell..but i expect more sbf in future because of 10years mop,btohqsg
Do you mean the HLE we submitted years back when we ballot? Or a new hle which hdb might ask us to do again before key collection? ðŸ˜† This is the part many of us find it vagueðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
besides neighbour  theres divorce cases too.. if 5yrs MOP and the divorce thingy happen half way during MOP ppl might endure for the sake of $$$.. if early stage during MOP or 10yrs MOP might be a different story..,btohqsg
divorce case then just hold on to the house until MOP and sell lo  if both parties above 35,btohqsg
if not  HDB will probably repossess,btohqsg
When u apply is HLE than update your HLE. Apply & collect key HLE must be the same nos,btohqsg
I click wrongly NO than reapply HFE  kana reject. It takes me 6 months to solve it,btohqsg
If have children  one of them can hold on with the children who has care and control or custody over,btohqsg
