@SGCM_Adminconsider verifying if the sale is legit or just clocking numbers,btohqsg
I wouldn't trust that after seeing my own car changed as sold even though I'm still driving it,btohqsg
Also it doesn't help them much to mark it sold just for the sake of it because the listing expires,btohqsg
He's a friend of my friend,btohqsg
My friend’s friend is the owner,btohqsg
It helps clock sales to be most whatever there is in sgcarmart,btohqsg
I just didn't expose the dealer that's all,btohqsg
Then maybe our friend not the same,btohqsg
Idk if anyone really looks at that?,btohqsg
You 2 can private check them can know already,btohqsg
I on SGCM just to look for my next car,btohqsg
People need to stop ghosting me sigh,btohqsg
Unless you want to add on a 4th car,btohqsg
The rate of them ghosting me,btohqsg
So I’m gonna look for another shitbox,btohqsg
If can find one that isn’t heavily molested and a good price,btohqsg
Ngl base model impreza also in my choice,btohqsg
They still can find a full time job and get additional MP pay,btohqsg
You can buy 破车(Porsche) = broken car 😜 PDK can endure abuse😜👍,btohqsg
Wa anyone knows if u make a feedback on road users flaunting rules,btohqsg
but you got so much time to report meh?,btohqsg
I damn triggered with one golf  he from filter lane just speed never even stop to check,btohqsg
you cfm the one posting on sgrv every week or something,btohqsg
I sometimes see accident or ppl cut i also bochap alr,btohqsg
Not me to do TP job sia,btohqsg
Flouting or flaunting sia? Two very different meanings 😂,btohqsg
I assumed he meant flouting lol,btohqsg
brother like this one then you report,btohqsg
Anyways you can report to TP but they will take at least 9 months to investigate if it doesn’t involve accident  injury or death,btohqsg
i think you more sensitive than TP alr,btohqsg
I reported my own car getting damaged by an insecure object flying from a truck. I only got a reply 1 year after my report,btohqsg
But the outcome thankfully was a positive one and the driver was charged,btohqsg
Personal gratification ≠ teaching a lesson,btohqsg
they are literally making money selling negativity and stereotypes,btohqsg
and by posting  you're just promoting their platform which may come bite you in your backside someday,btohqsg
Uk if he said sorry afterwards as I drove by instead of staring at me as if im wrong  i wudnt be so pissed abt it,btohqsg
No positivity from me today. Shall just report TP feedback channel then,btohqsg
How to say sorry sia ?,btohqsg
I drove past him and i slowed down,btohqsg
Or double hazard but nope decided to stare right at me,btohqsg
You nv show him the international sign   hahaha,btohqsg
try meditation  you seem to have a road rage issue,btohqsg
😂😂😂 yeah I do but u dun see me on the roads cus i type only. No action. Not worth to go to jail for such people,btohqsg
I think in general meditation helps u calm ur mind. Relaxes ur body too~ did it last time,btohqsg
Curse and swear in the car. It helps,btohqsg
Some driver very funny 1   they like to tailgate but doesnt want to over take,btohqsg
this and just think maybe the fella eat mala need to go toilet to calm yourself down,btohqsg
🫠🫠 if i alone okay ah. If with people i think sometimes just hold it first bah,btohqsg
that tends to be the case when they don't want to overtake on the left and you are hogging lane 1 usually,btohqsg
May his LS made him sleep and hug the toilet bowl for a night,btohqsg
No leh   yesterday i was driving from lane 1 to lane 4   the driver behind me follow me sia,btohqsg
Wahh…I cannot. I will jus spew whatever it comes into my mind. This kind of driver super irresponsible and rude leh,btohqsg
I speed up   the car also speed up,btohqsg
Then i stop at the road shoulder,btohqsg
Huh? For what sia? You hurt his ego 🫢,btohqsg
or he was just following flow of traffic?,btohqsg
Some egoistic drivers jus simply not happy and think that u challenging him,btohqsg
I think before he tailgate me   i got high beam him,btohqsg
some just tend to have shorter following distance,btohqsg
you high beam for what reason though,btohqsg
My friend told me not to drive fast   then i shift to lane 2,btohqsg
Very hard to understand their mentality. Life is more precious than ego,btohqsg
Nvm la   that is yesterday issue already   today is almost ending and tomorrow is a brand new day,btohqsg
Trying to be funny i think,btohqsg
sorry admin but the pattern fits,btohqsg
Today no 1 entertain him i guess  ,btohqsg
maybe no one go downstairs play in the playground,btohqsg
He can play with the rats at the playground,btohqsg
I think he's too young for that,btohqsg
But hardly see any stray cats around,btohqsg
From the way you talk  most don't want to reply so take this as a courtesy and fix yourself sir,btohqsg
dangerous  they can turn back and scratch you,btohqsg

No need to experiment. The admins are very good and top class here.,btohqsg
If I finish it first  will I get into trouble for the flying bottle or the DUI?,btohqsg
Hi  like to get some feedback on bmw x1 2017 2018 . Considering so would like to get some feedback,btohqsg
Works pretty well for me nowadays  been seeing very less road hoggers,btohqsg
Uhh that one not on purpose ah,btohqsg
The newer gen is quite ok eh,btohqsg
Obviously if you only go to AD for service will be more expensive cause got brand tax,btohqsg
But bmw to run well require preventative maintenance  so u need ownself do and not wait till it spoils,btohqsg
Then by all means go ahead,btohqsg
I think that's the case with everything called a machine,btohqsg
Korean jap car not so preventive,btohqsg
I like to call it more tolerance,btohqsg
You start with lesser things in them so lesser things to think of,btohqsg
Can put it that way I suppose,btohqsg
The gen was for his friend's car,btohqsg
saw a lot use x1 as phv. good workhorse?,btohqsg

Not sure.But alot of 216GT diesel.One rental company bring in alot1 tank1000km😱,btohqsg
Looks similar to the x1 if you're not well versed with them,btohqsg
could be haha. I not well versed in cars with no buttocks.😂😂. only cars with buttocks turn me on😛,btohqsg
X1 x2 x3 look very similar,btohqsg
Wow big tank or big mileage?,btohqsg
its just diesel being more fuel efficient,btohqsg
1000km is when engine is new bah,btohqsg
mine now runs 700 plus km full tank only,btohqsg
My previous ride less than 500,btohqsg
The back and sides very distinguishable,btohqsg
Must see what your tank size it,btohqsg
if i stay stock can maintain 800-900,btohqsg
I find it baffling when people compare range on a full tank but don't know how big their tank is,btohqsg
usually sedan standard is about 50 litres,btohqsg
bigger cars iirc is up to 60 or 70 litres?,btohqsg
nvr had a sedan w 70 litres,btohqsg
And f82 is the first m4,btohqsg
Before that was m3 e92 for coupe and e93 for vert,btohqsg
I nv own bm before . But I test drive a few and quite like it,btohqsg
F3x/F8x onwards the sedan became the 3 and the coupe and vert became the 4,btohqsg
Oh and the touring is 3 as well,btohqsg
This basically impossible unless you're dumping fuel,btohqsg
can afford A8 . $200 is petty cash,btohqsg

Win with Changi campaign has a grand prize winner 😱The 'Win with Changi' campaign saw Amanda Marie Siow walking away with a new Porsche Taycan after competing in a series of games.Admin's Note: The COE and road tax she has to pay to drive the free car tho... 😀➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
Do ppl usually sell the car or what,btohqsg
ya COE so ex  sell just the car can afford a new BMW,btohqsg
You get an option to take the money or the car I believe  also the car is complete base spec taycan,btohqsg
But the one in the pictures is a decent spec,btohqsg
Ah nowadays car dealers ripping is off w all the options,btohqsg
The axs one I read up the terms and condition,btohqsg
Either you take the car or walk away with nothing,btohqsg
plenty of dealers willing to buy the car anyway,btohqsg
take the car even no COE you still earn a fair amount,btohqsg
Cause i remembered there was this month i helped everyone pay using axs,btohqsg
I thought got chance so i read up terms and condition,btohqsg
Well they're not always ripping you off  sometimes it's the manufacturer prices that are high and then the added arf due to the omv going up,btohqsg
Changi one is an option I believe  if you remember the I pace that was given away  the car ended up being sold at wearnes because the person took the cash,btohqsg
Especially for PIs  they are able to getan agent car with a warranty and delivery miles,btohqsg
