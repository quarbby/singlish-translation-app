Hi guys  I am in a dilemma now and would like to seek some advice from all of you.I have just purchased a 2016 1.2t qashqai J11.2 days into delivery  my car had a lot of white smoke being emitted from its exhaust and we stopped the car. My initial suspect was a blown gasket head. However after towing it back to my dealer’s workshop  I was informed that it was a blown turbo. Now I am informed that turbo is not covered under “engine & gearbox warranty” and was given a quotation of 4.5k+ to get a new turbo  inlet/outlet pipes etc.I’m not super sure of the market rate but was told by some of my workshop that the price is sky high. Could anyone please advise? Am thinking of taking this up to CASE.,btohqsg
I am not super sure so would like to seek the expertise of everyone here to advise me. Currently his written “warranty” doesn’t include the turbo charger,btohqsg
Lemon law does not cover if it’s a consignment unit,btohqsg
It’s not a consignment unit  got it from a dealership.,btohqsg
It could be at any point of time. Don’t quote me just saying,btohqsg
Thanks in advance for all your helpful inputs.,btohqsg
White smoke could be turbo or head gasket.,btohqsg
As per what I was informed  it’s not a head gasket issue/engine block crack.,btohqsg
Didnt u do PPI or STA evaluation prior?,btohqsg
Smells like lemon...I would go case especially since the dealer is betting that you won't.,btohqsg
Confirm its not consignment car? Cus some dealers they dont tell u its consignment car,btohqsg
Brought it to a workshop for evaluation  however there were no major issues raised.,btohqsg
Dont give us the dealer full name just XX where appropriate,btohqsg
I prefer to know  so I can avoid,btohqsg
Currently I’m waiting for my dealer to get back to me on how we’re going to settle this.,btohqsg
If he isn’t willing to help  then I’ll bring this up to CASE,btohqsg
And sgcarmart admin should take note,btohqsg
And preferably share it with all of you,btohqsg
It’s located in CARROS  famous place anyway haha,btohqsg
Not on U to prove that its broken,btohqsg
Give him a deadline  preferably a week  if they not going to take back the car or offer compensation  then go case. Unscrupulous ones will give all sorts of reasons to drag.,btohqsg
Onus of repair falls unto them,btohqsg
But wa ur workshop also dk turbo got problem? When test drive got leak air sound anot,btohqsg
Dealer sure drag citing all sorts of reasons,btohqsg
now dealers are not upfront about consignment cars. Do you have the contract in black and white that it is not consignment car?,btohqsg
No abnormal sound/compression issue from engine/turbo,btohqsg
It just blew on the 2nd day of driving,btohqsg
I’ll let you all know if my dealer is unwilling to give me any compensation.,btohqsg
Vehicle downtime 4 days I haven’t said anything too..,btohqsg
possible to go lower to 1.88?,btohqsg
seldom see qashqai turbo got problem tho,btohqsg
True that. But the turbo piping is broken.,btohqsg
the prev owner pia the card too hard alr lah,btohqsg
fellow driving 1.2 must be thinking he 1.6 turbo,btohqsg
Those with turbo   the car must let go after the 4th yrs,btohqsg
That what my SA told me,btohqsg
Hmm.. but I think it also depends on how the car was cared for.,btohqsg
Or at least that’s how I think.,btohqsg
Still within the warrenty and can fetch decent pricce when selling,btohqsg
I think whether turbocharged or NA engine  if care is poor  either way problems will surface.,btohqsg
my intake manifold broke aft i took over the car,btohqsg
Be careful guys  LTA now engaged special force to catch speeding drivers..,btohqsg
Wah.. That quite.. impressive to break sia,btohqsg
Impressive huh. Makes me wonder some times haha.,btohqsg
Yes it looks to be. Don’t think the outlet hose looks like this but please correct me if I’m wrong.,btohqsg
Only had a photo from the workshop.,btohqsg
Hmm. That sounds like a good idea but I’m not too sure about where I can actually order one and I’m not too sure about the technical part of it.,btohqsg
No pics of the turbo itself?,btohqsg
No I didn’t receive any pics from the workshop. This workshop has got a pretty bad rating however it’s the one the dealership is working with  thus I can’t choose.,btohqsg
So I was hoping some experts here can educate me on the turbo parts and whatnot. 😅,btohqsg
Hmm this is an intercooler part,btohqsg
Oh thanks for letting us know! Usually for turbo chargers  there’s inlet and outlet pipes right?,btohqsg
I think it is this part..,btohqsg
Does the green part go to the intercooler? Or engine Bay?,btohqsg
I think the moment you go other workshop fix  you would end up helping the bad ws got rid of your car problem cos they can deny all responsibilities,btohqsg
Yeah.. so I’m gonna wait and see if my dealer is willing to help cover this as the car is only 2 days old. If he’s not and he’s gonna shed responsibility  then I’ll bring it in to my own ws for reparation and bring this to CASE.,btohqsg
this car is a lemon  ur gna have more problems afterwards,btohqsg
Report to case immediately. Later they just say in the process   you damage the car yourself . Y go repair ?,btohqsg
I’ll await till Wednesday to see if my dealer is willing to do the reparation  otherwise I’ll seek help from CASE as per your advice.,btohqsg
I think you can go report tomorrow. If Monday they not doing anything immediately then they won’t do anything,btohqsg
No need to give chance de   you pay for the vehicle and you are wasting the $$$ not putting to good use,btohqsg
Eh ur vehicle in ws u still paying for it,btohqsg
Repair shud be done @ their cost,btohqsg
Hahaha. Noted with many thanks. I’ll see to it tomorrow in the morning.,btohqsg
I’ll keep you all posted of the outcome and definitely the workshop and dealer to avoid.,btohqsg
Just tell us the dealer   we all will avoid with immediate effect,btohqsg
There are some serious buyer or to change car …,btohqsg
But serious   I admire you . You still can endure  and wait for the dealer to get back to you . I will go bang their table Liao,btohqsg
Haha. Give them deadline till tomorrow. If tomorrow unsatisfactory I’ll go raise a CASE case against them.,btohqsg

I think he takes the cake liao,btohqsg
Not use to the turning radius ….,btohqsg
I think 17 should be ok ba,btohqsg
turning radius is more related to car model than your rim size leh,btohqsg
That y I not sure   so ask for guide,btohqsg
i heard if too big for ur car,btohqsg
when u turn u will scrape against ur own chassis,btohqsg
"normally 1"" bigger is fine. but if the car is lowered then can fix by rolling fender and/or changing alignment",btohqsg
Soundproofing won't help too much with this  need to choose good tyre and good tyre dims,btohqsg
I no change exhaust  is put maxhaust  any time can off the noise hehe,btohqsg
They tend to have high road noise,btohqsg
Wheels also but that's a bit more minute,btohqsg

Any recommendations for legal exhaust pipe. Looking for something that sounds like a Porsche Cayenne (idk how to describe  but a deep rumbling sound)  something that is suitable for a V8. Sorry if I’m not using the proper lingoToyota Land Cruiser  4.6L V8,btohqsg
Which V8 do you have sir?,btohqsg
Which one are you looking at?,btohqsg
Interesting choice of car. What was the reason behind your purchase sir?,btohqsg
How many are there in Singapore?,btohqsg
Aren’t you too? Or are you mainly trolling?,btohqsg
It is rare. That’s why curious. Maybe less than 5. Don’t sensitive,btohqsg
By the way  wifey apparently bought for me lmao  don’t know should install anot,btohqsg
Install alr will look like beng car with all the meter and stuff,btohqsg
You like hatchback so much ah,btohqsg

I buy car to play so no point buying a long term one,btohqsg
Can recommend where to do 🤣,btohqsg
You seem to like telling people what to do,btohqsg
Fitment will be swee for sure!,btohqsg
Don’t mind  could you elaborate more? I’m not so familiar on car upgrading,btohqsg
I saw on tiktok people keep saying straight pipe,btohqsg
But it makes their car louder and sound better,btohqsg
It’s my dad’s. He likes big beefy imposing size cars.,btohqsg
I know LHL bodyguards use it. I saw it on his IG story,btohqsg
Hey man  nothing wrong with asking a question. I also dk anything about exhaust pipe so I ask question. No need to be so rude 🫤,btohqsg
But exhaust is something LTA apparently take seriously about,btohqsg
Lols so you gotta becareful in choosing your exhaust,btohqsg
But stock V8 should sound nice also 🤭,btohqsg
It’s a beautiful ride for sure. One of my family friends had one in Malaysia.,btohqsg
It doesn’t  that’s the thing!!! It sounds boring and ordinary,btohqsg
Is it legal to put widebody kits on cars in sg ?? Ive seen like a brz with a rocketbunny kit,btohqsg
Can ask around some exhaust shops!,btohqsg
Or is there like some paperwork you needa do,btohqsg
I think it’s car specific and likely with a very low population  it might be very challenging to find an LTA aftermarket one to begin with. I think they need at least 5 for homologation but not 💯 on that one too.,btohqsg
Very few legal options  you will probably have to try and get it homologated yourself,btohqsg
depends on how wide the widebody is,btohqsg
But then like i read before spoilers cannot petrude the car,btohqsg
They can provide answers for noobs like me?,btohqsg
The rule is it cannot be wider than the widest part of the car,btohqsg
So doesnt that mean those attached from the back of a car is illegal?,btohqsg
High five to same term brother!! 🙌🏼,btohqsg
Instead of on the boot lid,btohqsg
Actually I got hear people keep saying ricky,btohqsg
Woohoo  my brother from another mother,btohqsg
I’m excited for your ride improvements!,btohqsg
For hatchback right  my understanding is cannot protrude so out and not longer. Some hatchback one within carwidth can pass,btohqsg
But ask them nicely and they’ll answer you,btohqsg
Ok… I know which one liao. 😛😛😛😛 I not gonna share here wait polis come,btohqsg
