Niama late night so many donkeys,btohqsg
really? can i see the real trades,btohqsg
Admin so hardworking. 10.43pm still at work 💪,btohqsg
wow.. this place zoo sio.. sir@ic3l3mont3a. got unicorn   got donkey   got horse.,btohqsg
Anyone tried selling their car on Sgcarmart before? As a direct seller instead of getting dealer to sell,btohqsg
What to expect after listing? How to know test drive party is genuinely interested to buy?,btohqsg
Good question. Also want to know.,btohqsg
Nowadays  can buy/sell HDB without agent. Should also be able to buy/sell without dealer.,btohqsg
When u list ur car as direct seller on carmart  they will ask if u want the seller kit,btohqsg
If u select yes  they will mail you everything you need to sell the car  including contract  step by step guide  test drive waiver,btohqsg
eh.. i tot all the forms can be downloaded online?,btohqsg
ya all those can be found online,btohqsg
i bought direct.. the seller went as far as car viewing and test drive started from the carpark beside rather than the carpark he usually parks at. avoid cunning dealers going to scratch the car after viewing and then lowering the price. haha in my opinion very extreme but to each his own,btohqsg
how to know genuine parties.. i think cannot la  just have to let them test drive lo,btohqsg
yes that is absolutely correct. In fact  once you've found a buyer already  u just need to send the Sales agreement to us and we will help u settle the rest,btohqsg
provided that you listed your car on sgCarMart 😂,btohqsg
That shows how bad the general reputation of used car dealers are:),btohqsg
Does sgcarmart help to settle the sellers car loan?,btohqsg
Yes  we help to do loan settlement for seller  and application for buyer,btohqsg
Good to know theres a credit company doing this. If not have to Loan from Loan shark HAHA,btohqsg
the service is called sgCarMart Connect. More info here :)https://connect.sgcarmart.com/,btohqsg
Got dealer telling me my phone would be flooded with calls  mostly dealers if I advertise,btohqsg
Then another dealer suggest why not I go direct instead of thru dealer  process is easy to manage,btohqsg
wa simi dealer ask u go direct lol,btohqsg
Manners maketh man: A well-dressed jaywalker gives cam car the middle finger for honking at himThis guy needs a slap to wake up his idea!🤬React with a 🤬  if you agree he needs a slap to wake up his idea!React with a 😄  if what the driver said towards the end made you laugh!React with a ❤️ for bothRead the full story👉🏻https://bit.ly/37nGwBY,btohqsg
Will he lose his job tmr? If this gets viral?,btohqsg
Why would he lose his job?😅,btohqsg
Anyone encounter using sgcarmart bidding flatflorm for selling  final bidded price agreed. Then meet dealer still want lower citing tis n that ?,btohqsg
The one pointing middle finger for jaywalking? Local? LOL,btohqsg
Get a temp prepaid SIM card with new number for this.,btohqsg
U will be flooded with dealers everywhere. First hand experience via carousell. Just ignore them,btohqsg
Will it make a difference if he's local or not? IMO  being rude is being rude lah  no need care about the person's nationality🤭,btohqsg
Not that. If this goes viral. If hes wearing uniform. Affect image ... ?,btohqsg
You can actually opt to leave out your phone number. And just get contacted via an email enquiry :),btohqsg
OH. Probably not  since the video is too pixelated to CSI him or his 'uniform' out. He may even be wearing his own suit and tie and not a uniform😆,btohqsg
Then ok more of these people on the road lol. Makes us a better place lOl. Peace Peace.,btohqsg
As drivers  we are mostly the one in the 'wrong' regardless of what we do in such a situation🥲,btohqsg
This was the old business model right? The new business model removes such a risk of dealers haggling down prices after bidding ends. What happens is sgCarMart will purchase the car over from the dealer and pay direct to seller  essentially removing that risk.,btohqsg
Yup correct. The Quotz bidding service ensures that sellers wont need to entertain any price haggling :),btohqsg
Anyone here used Quotz to sell their car before?,btohqsg

If me I rather pay 100 to agent and do all the loan and paperwork for me then to do direct,btohqsg
few thousands probably.. dealers also need to eat eh,btohqsg
Ah.. my experience w them 2018… before this.. i see.. txs txs,btohqsg
Treat it like carousell? I bought my car from direct owner. So need to secure your own loan  transact by cashier order or as per instructed by the seller.,btohqsg
Yes… that’s what the sender wants to achieve lor…. But is ok one  he himself beware… u do the 1st  sure got pple do the 15th one,btohqsg
Can dun eat so much? Apply for loan  insurance   do online transfer pick up car and deliver car…. Still can get Comm for loans and insurance,btohqsg
Price will be slightly diff from trade in price rite?,btohqsg
Usually not 100 ah...more than that,btohqsg
Would there be a lemon concern?,btohqsg
