Pulled out after the drop. If you never hit the 100k limit for uob one  might as well put there.,btohqsg
Uob one need credit card spending?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  if I am buying furnitures like those from King Living  which credit card should I use? Can UOB Lady‚Äôs be used for 6mpd and under which category? Couldn‚Äôt find the matching MCC in the UOB   categories. King Living MCC is 5712.,btohqsg
does anyone know  for UOB ONE min $500 card spend  will transactions paid via CardUp be included?i made a payment via CardUp using ONE card  post date is 17 aug. however under ONE interest tracker  it is still not reflecting the amount spent till today.,btohqsg
if offline use contactless cards like uob ppv/vs  if online use online card like dbs wwmc/citi rewards,btohqsg
I remember it is stated clearly what is excluded in TnC. You may want to take a look at TnC.,btohqsg
i see. i always had the idea that its only excluded from the $800 min spend  required for higher cashback.,btohqsg
cardup excluded from $500 for quarterly rebate and also $500 for bonus interest,btohqsg
ahh ok. means i paid the additional cardup fee for nothing haha,btohqsg
Does anyone knows if DBS WWMC offers 0% installment for online purchase?,btohqsg
Lesson learnt- whenever making big purchase/transaction  always read TnC yourself. If TnC stated yes  it becomes a document that can support you when you call CSO to ask for missing rewards.Any answer you get from chat group can‚Äôt support you.,btohqsg
Thank you for the reply. But if I always buy air tickets one shot about 4-5k. The cap is only $1000 right.,btohqsg
Second this! I will add on citirewards + instarem,btohqsg
Citi reward only give 0.4 mpd for travel related spend,btohqsg
i will pair it with instarem which helps connvert overseas spend to local spend to get 4mpd :),btohqsg
for the expenses! sorry  didnt give context. not for travel related.,btohqsg
Ya op was mainly asking the big one on hotel and airticket which is why chris din suggest citireward amaza combo,btohqsg
