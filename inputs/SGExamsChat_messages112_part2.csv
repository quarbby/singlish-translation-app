If u’d like to find a tutor there’s tuition telegram groups out there  but we don’t want to encourage posts like these cause it can get spammy.,btohqsg
U just search on the bar,btohqsg
I still haven't heard your fundamental rights,btohqsg
Eh but there's a case for this also  because these devices don't track your physical location  they track numbers associated with the people you interact with instead,btohqsg
By the way  if you're not Sovereign  then you presumably acknowledge the existence of this place's Constitution.,btohqsg

YOU WILL ONLY GROVEL AT PAP'S HEELS BY GETTING A JOB,btohqsg
So you’re saying that to be a good skeptical citizen  I should not get a job,btohqsg
Imo  i think the device is a good measure. Yes  it might be a privacy concern for some  but i place my health abv all else,btohqsg
TBH I don't think they have any ownership titles of the air but correct me if I'm wrong,btohqsg
