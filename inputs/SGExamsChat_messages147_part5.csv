I'm not even a teenager anymore...,btohqsg
wad excuse to skip HBL class,btohqsg
Sorry cher  my laptop on mc.,btohqsg
tell the cher that ur wifi got problem the next hbl class,btohqsg
tell them the next live lesson ah,btohqsg
3 days left before I die.ü§©,btohqsg
do ur teachers take attendance? just say hi then go lor,btohqsg
Do you have to turn on the camera during the lesson?,btohqsg
When I was taking online classes for my exchange I didn't have the camera on. I can be doing other things,btohqsg
Use photo. Say u using landline. Dun want to use too much data,btohqsg
nope we don't  none of us do :) at least not for my classes except korean class,btohqsg
Yeah so what I do is just walk away. And when I hear the lecturer say raise your hand if you understand then I just come over and press the button,btohqsg
I personally didn't understand that lecturer but he is very intelligent  so I didn't bother listening too much,btohqsg
Just study using the notes and online resources,btohqsg
How steep are the bell curve for ur mods with 100% online graded assessments,btohqsg
What do you mean by steep?,btohqsg
Mine is usually not bell curved and a lot of the time many people fail and do poorly...That's why you are luckier with the bell curve,btohqsg
Because often they aren't willing to push people up,btohqsg
I had a test the other day. Many students felt it was much harder than previous years. But the lecturer insists that it was the same...What can the students do? Unlikely he will push the grades up and let more people be worse off,btohqsg
Or even 98% just for B+,btohqsg
But cant rly say the mod is easy,btohqsg
You're lucky. I don't even understand what they are teaching sometimes. I hate watching recorded lectures. So boring. I rather learn and do the assignment and tutorialThey don't change their ways of doing things during the pandemic. They make students hand up the same amount of work or even more during this time.... Absolute nightmare. Today I just handed up two assignments  one tutorial and one quiz... And don't think the quiz questions are easy.... Yesterday I handed up another assignment. And the assignments are never easy  the type where they want you to have a good think over a few days,btohqsg
I dont even have h2 physics knowledge and i need to clutch de brogile and quantum chem,btohqsg
H2 physics is watered down. Don't compare with A levels.I thought you were studying economics? Are you are taking physics as an optional module?,btohqsg
Sometimes it is better not to know A level stuff. It may contradict,btohqsg
Specifically? I don't think I could just tick science on the NUS/NTU form. There should be a specialisation or whatever its calledInteresting how the NUS and NTU forms were different but the acceptance page was the same. They managed to link it all up.,btohqsg
Oh? I thought university... Hahaha. Okay  no wonder there is no H2 physics background,btohqsg
Wait wait  who y'all taking about,btohqsg
no he was born last week,btohqsg
H2 Physics is not helpful anyway,btohqsg
They are too superficial that they don't even go into the mathematical part of quantum,btohqsg
U can learn it from scratch without any disadvantage from not having H2 knowledge,btohqsg
I realise that sg has a lot of cars on roas,btohqsg
The small little road running past my estate has q a bit of cars,btohqsg
Wat happened? Rainy day  can't play üèÄ,btohqsg
"Reminds me of the ""oops my ball rolled here"" pickup lines",btohqsg
Do those born in 2000 and after get the $600 payouts? I think they said you have to be 21 this year. From my calculations only those born in 1999 and before get the payouts,btohqsg
And I'm curious for those born in 2000 and smoke  how does it work? Since they raise the smoking age on 1st January each year  does it mean that these people cannot smoke from 1st January until their birthday  and can smoke from their birthday until 31st December?,btohqsg
anyone here knows which uni has early apps for poly?,btohqsg
and when is the early application date,btohqsg
smoking age raised every year? i didn't know that üò≥ i thought it's 19 rn,btohqsg
Maybe can raise smoking age to 100,btohqsg
they raise each year till its 21 üò©üò©,btohqsg
no only 1999 get 600. 2000 on ur parents/guardian get 300 instead,btohqsg
Yes  the last stage from 20 to 21 will happen 1st January of next year,btohqsg
Okay. Thanks. But I think the extra $300 is only one time. The $600 payout occurred two times  but the second payment may vary depending on salary  house ownership and age,btohqsg
why don't they just raise it to 21 one-shot,btohqsg
Then people born in the late 90s may not be able to smoke for a while.,btohqsg
But the law is really odd to those born in 2000. Well  I guess they don't want to encourage people to smoke,btohqsg
I was a bit taken aback a while ago when I found out that those born in 2000 and after have NRIC numbers starting with T instead of S.,btohqsg
