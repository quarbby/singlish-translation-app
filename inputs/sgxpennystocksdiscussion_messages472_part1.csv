Breaking Update: All eyes on PPI data and Uncle Powell's statement tonightUncle Powell will begin his journey to appear before Congress  particularly the House Financial Services Committee today. His mission is the same: calm the inflation fear and sustain market stability.It will be a tough sell on transitory inflation storyThe latest round of inflation blew past Wall Street‚Äôs expectations  and investors are re-thinking if price pressures are indeed fleeting. The CPI data suggested broad-based inflation and spending categories such as food  haircuts  and rent had increased 0.9% in June  compared to May 2021.This is contrary to the expected cooling price pressure. As a result  the narrative of transitory inflation is becoming an uphill story to sell. In contrast  officials had warned that inflation would remain elevated  and in Pika World‚Äôs case  we see an inflation inflection point within the next quarter.Inflation pressure is buildingA review of the inflation data shows some unsettling trends. For example  when we remove the volatile components such as food and energy categories and zoom into core inflation  they appear to have surpassed 0.7% for 3 months consecutively.Despite the underlying trend  Pika World expects Uncle Powell to remain consistent in his communication on the inflation topic as he testifies before Congress. He could also stress the unsustainable rise in used car and truck prices  which ran up another 10.5% in June compared to May. This rise accounts for more than one-third of the overall CPI‚Äôs increase. If we take out this component  the total price increase could have been up by only 0.5%.This will paint gentler mellowing inflation rather than a beast run-off mode.Stickiness in inflation is a downside riskAt Pika World  we are concerned with some price pressure  particularly the shelter component with mounting pressure. The shelter is no doubt a significant component of the CPI  and it is often the stickest. However  the nature of rents is such that they do not move abruptly  and once it starts to shift gear  either up or down  it tends to have a persistent effect.If there is any comfort from the market  it will be possible from Uncle Powell statement tonight.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us build a resilient ecosystem.,btohqsg
