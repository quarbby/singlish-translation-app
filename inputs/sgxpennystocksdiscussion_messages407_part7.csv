Actually SG Govt for years I think did encourage labour intensive factories move to jb or Batam for them to benefit n we concentrate on higher value added biz hq in SG but now with covid  that is very inconvenient bcos of travel n logistics control. Who knows n the world would hv expected the constraints of covid globally so this is an unheard of n impossible to anticipate crisis,btohqsg
