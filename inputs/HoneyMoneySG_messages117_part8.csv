Hi guys  i am thinking of getting a loan to finance my purchase of a new Motorcycle. The information i currently have is that banks charge an interest rate for personal loan starting from at least 3.46%  trust bank instant loan is 2.79% and in-house loan with the dealer is 5%. This is considering a loan amount of 12K over 24 months. Can anyone advise if monthly payment for the loans is applicable with CardUp to earn cash back/ miles rewards?Or are there better ways i can go about to finance my motorcycle purchase?,btohqsg
have you considered using 6 month balance transfers to finance your motor cycle?The rate is still approx 2.xx% p.a.What some people do is take the BT with Bank A  then at month 5  take another BT with Bank B... rotate the process..,btohqsg
That‚Äôs a big chunk of miles. If possible to do amex charge card new sign up is better bonus miles higher,btohqsg
Hi. If I use the UOB one card for insurance premiums  does it count towards the monthly $500 spend for the quarterly 3.33% rebate?,btohqsg

Ok thanks. Will refer to it.,btohqsg
Feels like a lot of banks are moving away from cashback and pushing towards miles instead,btohqsg
Where? Means to get the sign up rewards now  new users must do trades? I think still not allowed to withdraw till past 30 days.,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSGhow many days do you get on your ABTC when you enter M'sia? I always get 30 days only at Woodlands checkpoint even though I queue at the ABTC counter and present my card to the imm officer.,btohqsg
Yes  I am a sole prop and I managed to apply for ABTC. You need to sign off on your own letter and attach the ACRA docs,btohqsg
Thanks! How long does it take to get approved? And do you get extended days if you're there just for leisure? Haha,btohqsg
Up to 90 days  sometimes the immigration officer may not know the exact dayshttps://www.apec.org/docs/default-source/groups/abtc/0-abtc-economy-entry-information-table-(as-of-18-oct-2022)852440b8682b4b84b94ccbe4745b0dbc.pdf?sfvrsn=260f0b80_2,btohqsg
oh so you need to ask is it?,btohqsg
Also be careful/do not apply eVisa/ETA for Aus/NZ/PNG as it may hinder your ABTC as in this link,btohqsg
usually I day trip to JB so no need for 90 days (this was before egate was open without registration)  but I was always curious if they would stamp you in for 90 days. I am a digital nomad though  and I have utilized the ABTC extended stay for TH  IN  and VN,btohqsg
I will not stay beyond if not stamped  but can try asking,btohqsg

Hi does anyone know if Instarem x citi will get miles if used with WeChat pay/Alipay in China? Thanks!,btohqsg
3 weeks to get a sms confirmation of successful setup. If you are unlucky that setup was after ur cc statement is generated  you need to wait for a full month for giro to start working.Usually no news is good news. they are just simply slow. üòÖ,btohqsg
How you link instarem and amaze tgt when they are the same,btohqsg
i got 10x points for wechat pay using amaze x crmc,btohqsg
Hi guys UOB account tracker is track posted date for CC right?,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony!Is it worth for me to call either banks to confirm this? I have submitted my form around late May and my CC statement date is 18th this month  so means even if the giro is setup it has already missed giro cutoff for this month?Is there any indicator I can check from online banking? There isn‚Äôt a lot of transparency here thoughAnd I have yet to receive any SMS and it has been more than 3 weeks for me now,btohqsg
Well dont think there is anything online for us to check. You can try calling but be ready for the long wait. If you submitted late may  most likely the form is already with hsbc. You can start from there first.,btohqsg
Thank you! I‚Äôll give HSBC a call tomorrow :),btohqsg
Btw  you will see something like this in yr dbs cc statement when the setup is done.,btohqsg
