But i guess they dh capital to sustain,btohqsg
I prefer the jump to PhD too la more hua but the gap is also significant la,btohqsg
The competition between grab and uber was good for consumers. Prices are lower before covid,btohqsg
now that i think of it hor i nvr see a single dr in accountancy,btohqsg
I'm the oldest child. They're a bit apocalyptical so not very stable minded and perhaps they're not working so they feel not worth it?They're pointing to articles from education minister saying people should go Poly and ya.,btohqsg
those articles...doesn't really diminish how important uni can be,btohqsg
sounds like a v short term view. uni can better provide for yourself and your family in the longer term,btohqsg
Yep I think so too and want to move out from my family WHEN I can because they're too restrictive because of short term views.,btohqsg
i mean unless your family is unfortunately genuinely fucking broke la then i think that's a different story,btohqsg
even then  there's a lot of different (financial) support systems and nets that can help,btohqsg
These are the same ministers that attended LSE on singapore scholarship,btohqsg
Lol I'm literally struggling working part-time and trying to keep a 4.0 GPA and get into main Committee role in cca as well. That's why no time to go for holidays,btohqsg
So then again.. actions speaks louder than words.,btohqsg
push on. one hurdle at a time,btohqsg
The $500 every month is hard enough.,btohqsg
maincomm for cca for portfolio ah,btohqsg
but yea for long term  uni is the way to go imo esp if you're interested in research,btohqsg
Yep  heard scholarship need so yeah,btohqsg
if you can maintain your high gpa and get scholarship then really nothing your fam can say tbh,btohqsg
Won't give up on my dreams then,btohqsg
i got into ntu probably because of my portfolio,btohqsg
anyway anything further than bachelors right  you can try out research etc within uni,btohqsg
to see if it's your cup of tea,btohqsg
score was quite a few points below the published igp  went for interview and only talked about the stuff on my portfolio,btohqsg
having an interesting portfolio gives interviewers things to talk about,btohqsg
Yep  they're making good money too,btohqsg
even my intern interview talked about my portfolio more than my school stuff n grades,btohqsg
It's a delicate balance and ultimately the government maintains the status quo,btohqsg
Probably more spots will be open up but the percentages stays the same as JC prospects are literally focus on Uni,btohqsg
I see. And my parents keep telling me the benefits I've gotten sInce entering Poly instead of JC,btohqsg
Whereas poly allows for a Pivot to industry in the eyes of the government,btohqsg
i've a few friends that have parents with similar sentiments to just work after poly,btohqsg
one moved out and is going germany for a masters now,btohqsg
I mean background aside he went to Cambridge,btohqsg
i have a friend who graduated i think a year or two ago from poly and decided not to go uni,btohqsg
now she regretting and trying to get a spot in uni,btohqsg
during uni she worked a lot  then she worked for a few years before going for masters,btohqsg
yea poly limits more than people realise,btohqsg
I see. Scrimping and saving whenever I can too.,btohqsg
honestly i want to say that u shld still treat yourself sometimes la  u deserve to treat yourself sometimes too,btohqsg
I mean skill based approach is good and all but letting 16 year olds choose their industry is a bad idea imo,btohqsg
Poly specialisations are good for industry but not good for exploration,btohqsg
nvr understood how we can have such a large population of engineers ngl,btohqsg
It's some sort of initiative that ensures a large supply and depressed wages,btohqsg
wow singapore so pro business help keep cost down,btohqsg
Because I mean engineers are important,btohqsg
I mean... NUS if u cmi for everything they exile you to engineering,btohqsg
they accepted me for facilities management,btohqsg
That one is like civil engineering w/o the engineering,btohqsg
hooray to one of the lowest salary courses!,btohqsg
