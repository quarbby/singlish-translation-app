From mid-2024  platform workers such as private-hire drivers and food delivery riders will be inducted into the CPF system if theyâ€™re below 30. Those who are older will be allowed to opt in  but canâ€™t change their minds later on.The amount theyâ€™ll have to set aside will be upped gradually and is projected to be on par with other sectors after five years. For the typical employee  thatâ€™s up to 20 percent of their monthly income. For employers  thatâ€™s up to 17 percent to be contributed into workersâ€™ CPF accounts.,btohqsg
