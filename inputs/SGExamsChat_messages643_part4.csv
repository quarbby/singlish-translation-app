got house got car got wife got dog,btohqsg
What Jc you went to then?,btohqsg
2019 was the year the mergers occured but 2018 they started to take in students in only one of the 2 pre merged schools that are to be merged together (eg. For MJC and TPJC  only MJC had a 2018 intake),btohqsg
Yeah ijc was the one that had no intake in 2018. But the J2 IJC students in 2018 stayed at IJC right?,btohqsg
Like they didnâ€™t share campus with yjc students,btohqsg
i need it to appeal to a jc,btohqsg
U could ask the JC U r appealing to to double check?,btohqsg
i miss the cop by 1,btohqsg
i think the chances are like,btohqsg
i got a lot of cca and via and academic award stuff to put,btohqsg
cause if ur l1r5 is higher than the cop,btohqsg
its unfair to ppl who have hit cop,btohqsg
Wouldnâ€™t the queue be the same then,btohqsg
But also idk why moe still wants to reuse the ijc campus instead of building a completely new one. Theyâ€™re just gonna refurbish the ijc campus and shift yijc to that place.,btohqsg
Tjc moving to tpjc old site is,btohqsg
All the other JCs with PRIME upgrading are getting completely new campuses,btohqsg
Theyâ€™re still getting a completely rebuilt campus,btohqsg
Yijc is the only one of the 4 in the 2019 batch to not get a rebuilt campus,btohqsg
rip merge until mostly single dogit,btohqsg
Just like what it was pre merger,btohqsg
See 2017 jc cop vs 2018,btohqsg
2018 every Jc increased their intake,btohqsg
ye i guess mostly the meh ones still meh,btohqsg
merge wld have lesser intake i tot?,btohqsg
It was just temporary. In 2018 with fewer schools  moe made each school increase their intake but when the birth rate and hence JC intake falls  each Jc will gradually shrink their intake,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why cop for nearly all the schs have been falling since 2018,btohqsg
But ofc  there are many other factors affecting cop besides intake,btohqsg
actually is there a statistic on % of cohort that get single digit?,btohqsg
but then do you think any ip schs will be increasing sec sch intake and decrease jc intake and vice versa,btohqsg
Moe used to release the number of students in each school with 4 A level distinctions  but stopped sometime around when the OA system was abolished,btohqsg
i heard some schs are increasing ip intake,btohqsg
then my batch has lesser sec sch classes than my senpais,btohqsg
No clue honestly  what I saw was from the news,btohqsg
Cause we needed to make space for jaes,btohqsg
We were previously full ip so almost 100% of our intake is from jh,btohqsg
so we could have more ppl now,btohqsg
GGWP AGAIN ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€,btohqsg
huh i heard sji got 1 more ip class,btohqsg
I thought you mean that they reduce the number of JH students  so thereâ€™s more space for JAE SH students,btohqsg
i think thats what happened for my school,btohqsg
Then IP students are the JH students,btohqsg
Like cos they enter in sec 1,btohqsg
but i supposedly heard that other school like sji open a new ip class,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why I thought you meant decrease IP intake,btohqsg
my sch and rvhs did i think,btohqsg
but we are still majority ip,btohqsg
So IP intake decrease  JAE increase intake for some Ip schs,btohqsg
But I guess as a whole JAE intake per sch is falling,btohqsg
cause i heard more ppl want poly now,btohqsg
The ej guy said jae intake increase but Iâ€™m guessing ip probably didnâ€™t rly change yet for them,btohqsg
