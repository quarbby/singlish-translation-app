Whrs the positivity in our car meets?,btohqsg
exactly what im trying to say üò≠,btohqsg
Every car meet ive been to  i see yps and car enthusiasts n carspotters (idw to name all) jeering at cars,btohqsg
I mean they‚Äôre just doing their job LOL,btohqsg
And also id like to address the stereotype on female drivers,btohqsg
okay true but still wanna firebomb LTAHQ,btohqsg
Why issit that everytime issa females car u guys like to jeer upon it? And always ask for the male driver instead? We need the respect on both ends,btohqsg
I think what their doing is q justified based on the incidents that happen lo,btohqsg
Got no choice when there's people out there anyhow driving  going cheap on mods that may affect safety (cheap tyres  brakes  shitty wiring  etc.),btohqsg
U guys need to know ur limits n boundaries to ALL ENTHUSIASTS N SPOTTERS AND EVERYONE IN THIS CHAT.,btohqsg
Correct  at the end of the day it‚Äôs just for the safety of everyone,btohqsg
I unds thats why its nvr been seen on the bigger picture,btohqsg
Everyone needs to bond back agn,btohqsg
Look at the other car meets from other countries,btohqsg
I mean sure some do jeer,btohqsg
But from what i observe its still not as bad as singapore,btohqsg
bro can keep politics per say out of a car chat not,btohqsg
Most r supportive of each other out thr for their own builds and respect the quality and work put into their cars,btohqsg
Screw them thenIgnore themAppreciate the cars with photos  attention and if you are courageous enough  the driver,btohqsg
Im not a driver nor am i an owner  but yet i feel bad for all the owners who have had their cars jeered at for nth,btohqsg
U guys deserve to b appreciated btr,btohqsg
But all in all we still a community,btohqsg
Whatever you do  there will be someone who does not agreeScrew them,btohqsg
I unds but still lets all put in some effort to try n minimise this shall we?,btohqsg
Just shut up or piss off,btohqsg
I mean at the end of the day everyone has their own opinion  it‚Äôs their personal choice and personality to keep that opinion to themselves,btohqsg
If you do not like the build  buy a stock model  get the one you want,btohqsg
Not justifying it! Just saying that we cannot rlly control it ah,btohqsg
But their mouth won‚Äôt shut one,btohqsg
Your ear canYour attention can be redirected.,btohqsg
Ever saw the video with the woman talking about climate change and a v12 just revs?,btohqsg
Agreed but still lets js try n minimise the toxicity in sg car communities,btohqsg
Cus for me stock or modify car all still the same i will take both  pic for them üëç,btohqsg
Ya end of the day it‚Äôs your choice if uw give attention to it,btohqsg
Basically nothing good to say just do say,btohqsg
I do not care about itAs long as it does not get in my way,btohqsg
Basc if u still want to jeer that‚Äôs u just being an asshole lo,btohqsg
Its cos i see that its been recurring for insults to b getting in drivers‚Äô ways,btohqsg
Nothing we can do to chance it,btohqsg
Thats why i felt a need to talk abt it,btohqsg
I used to be only like modified car ended up i change mind set to like both stock and modify car,btohqsg
Honestly if got 2 driver fight let them settle Lor don‚Äôt blow it up at all,btohqsg
Ya ik what u mean I walk talking abt the women driver thing,btohqsg
Cos its my friends who r owners,btohqsg
If you think person x is in the way of car y  either do something about it there or get on with your lifeThat is my attitudeEither do something about it to the person who is causing it or ignore it,btohqsg
I mean don rlly need to do anyth ah just ignore so it doesn‚Äôt blow up into another matter,btohqsg
Man up  go up to him  ask him to step asideIf not i would ignore,btohqsg
And im sure if ur friends who r owners feel this way yall wldnt wan that to happen also,btohqsg
Up to youSo far  i do not hear/see any negativity from anyoneMaybe because i am not observant enough  maybe i have not gone to enough meets,btohqsg
