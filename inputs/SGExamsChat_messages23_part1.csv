Plus is not ideal to implement that,btohqsg
the reason why we have a huge spike of new cases is due to the people returning back from overseas,btohqsg
and they would rather get treatment here in Singapore,btohqsg
basically just ban them from coming back,btohqsg
Even if implemented  the temp check will be a greater disruptuon imo,btohqsg
You can’t ban Singaporeans from returning to Singapore,btohqsg
do the 8pm to 8am for 18/hr,btohqsg
wah imagine temperature taking plus train fault,btohqsg
dont they have those kind of temp sensor machines,btohqsg
Essentially implementing temp check is like implementing daily train fault,btohqsg
that one some schools should have that,btohqsg
Esp if they need to drag ppl out with high daily temp,btohqsg
then come up with some bs rule like 'refusal to comply to temperature taking will result in deportation',btohqsg
Idk why such qns are asked when the notes/google have the literal answers,btohqsg
and also it wont make sense for the pharmaceutical industry to be a monopoly,btohqsg
no reassurance to be found here,btohqsg
i wrote monopoly am i getting 0,btohqsg
but i wrote productive and allocative inefficient,btohqsg
u get some marks for analysis,btohqsg
but i explained it in the “monopoly way”,btohqsg
till we see ur essay and ur qn,btohqsg
Econs is rly common sense one,btohqsg
2(a) is PD bc its transacted at diff prices at diff markets,btohqsg
i gave should & should not but explaining for monopoly,btohqsg
2(b) is prob because the pharmaceutical industry has patents etc,btohqsg
and if one company holds that right,btohqsg
i need talk about whether they’re productive & allocative efficient right,btohqsg
then they can price however high they want,btohqsg
i assumed only one company la,btohqsg
govt shd intervene bc drugs are a necessity to people suffering from certain diseases,btohqsg
take for instance drugs like insulin for diabetic patients,btohqsg
u cant have overpriced insulin for patients etc,btohqsg
then the opp ans would be,btohqsg
since pharmaceutical companies exist in an oligopoly,btohqsg
making prices naturally competitive and so if the govt were to intervene,btohqsg
i cant explain for u the theories etc bc its been yrs,btohqsg
the policies alr in place etc,btohqsg
what i did for micro qns is mainly demand supply,btohqsg
require less knowledge on ur own and if u can evaluate the situation on the spot,btohqsg
for this its rly the same ans,btohqsg
u cant have an overpriced healthcare system,btohqsg
then bring in policies alr in place by the govt to substantiate ur ans,btohqsg
i used underconsumption of goods with positive externalities and asymmetric information,btohqsg
i gave it in the context of heathcare too,btohqsg
then the second part just answered what they gave,btohqsg
the three policies and talk about its feasibility and effectiveness,btohqsg
i generally do not like market structure qns haha,btohqsg
a lot of seniors said that,btohqsg
Healthcare is a merit good  so there's information failure,btohqsg
asymmetric information it's for healthcare insurance bah...,btohqsg
