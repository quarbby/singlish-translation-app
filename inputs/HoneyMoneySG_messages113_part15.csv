Hi guys and Melvin  please correct me if I interpret the table wrongly but even at 103k  we would still be able to have like 3.9% interest per annum which doesn't seem that bad to me,btohqsg
Sorry I don't get where you get 3.9% from,btohqsg
Where is this magical number from? I don‚Äôt see a single 3.9%,btohqsg
I just did this with my wife ytd. Use 2 browser and cfm at the same time,btohqsg
Haha I input 103000 in the ocbc website and got like interest of 344.08 for 31 days. My bad is 3.9xxxx. I took 344.08/31*365 to get the annual interest. OK something I miss out might be we can't be having 103k for the whole year.,btohqsg
Using two browsers with two different krisflyer accounts?,btohqsg
I still don't get where you get 3.9% from. Maybe provide a screenshot?,btohqsg
The price still remains the same? No increase in pricing?,btohqsg
Nope. I did page by page together,btohqsg
Sq work like this  they have a certain amt for sales at the cheaper pricing then move next tier then move next tier  so as long as your 4 ticket still available in the cheapest class (not economy/eco pre/biz when i mean class but those like y/n/certain coding for different tier). U get that price,btohqsg

No   only 1 code at a time,btohqsg
Oh because I only able to spend on uob one so I can't spend 500 for ocbc. I see. Thank you for explaining.,btohqsg
ohh.. so i should do a one time payment first then subsequent i use the recurring insurance one?,btohqsg
ic okok! thanks so much for the reply everyone. üôèüèº,btohqsg
Then you could probably rotate 100k between OCBC 360 account and HSBC EGA. Without spend you will never beat HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
