what do u guys think of the,btohqsg
i said that but in less chim words,btohqsg
in fields that u can go in self-taught,btohqsg
I shall bless this chat with the wiggle,btohqsg
I‚Äôd say that it doesn‚Äôt matter  what matters is that you execute well over what qualifications you have,btohqsg
i feel its super hard to be a successful self taught,btohqsg
It's super hard to be successful. Period.,btohqsg
There are some things you'll only learn self-taught because schools/uni don't teach. There are some things you'll more easily learn in uni/school  but anything you can learn in uni/school is possible to learn outside of school too  tough harder.,btohqsg
Yeah because society desires like a written proof that you are indeed competent instead of finding out on their own cuz they could lose money,btohqsg
yeah to both of u :-/,btohqsg
A competent person would have some level of self-taught  and supplement that with some level of school-taught.If you only have one and not the other  you will stall at some point.,btohqsg
have both academia & industrial mindset,btohqsg
ideally imo  companies should just have a blind test that test for knowledge and skillsets that their job scope need  without regard for formal educationbecause ultimately  the cert is just a piece of paper that tells the employer you've learned and understood the content/skills to a competent extent,btohqsg
but it's more convenient to just sweep through thousands of potential employees by looking at their qualifications,btohqsg
I'd imagine you'll have to be a really competent self-taught individual who has achievements in their portfolio  to even be considered compared to ordinary degree holders  for the most part,btohqsg
and also to proof that you're sorta a mentally stable adult who can go thru with 4 years of high commitment to something,btohqsg
arguably  committing to self-taught for 4 years shows mental strength beyond going through 4 years of uni though.,btohqsg
you wont take 4 years to learn the same things alone tho,btohqsg
correct. most employers  because too many applicants  will filter by academics and grades unfortunately.if you somehow can get a competent self-taught no-degree person  beside a degree person  it will end up coming down to the quality of their work. and the value of the degree really doesn't show up as much.,btohqsg
so the magic sauce is...if you don't have the degree  but are competent and self-taught  how do you get in the room with the employer? networking (in the non-gross  non-cocktail bar way) is super super impt.,btohqsg
wouldn't it be an unfortunate scenario where even if the quality is the same  the self-taught individual would be paid disproportionately less compared than the degree holder?,btohqsg
so the degree would be there just to arbitarily inflate one's income,btohqsg
"i've had this conversation with my HR because my manager wants to pay me more  but the HR say ""how can  his qualifications not at that tier"".",btohqsg
if your portfolio is good  can demand higher charge,btohqsg
i told them i honestly don't give a shit how much i'm paid cus i more keen to contribute quality work. the longer i debate and talk about crap like that  the less good work i can do.,btohqsg
got the higher pay in the end.,btohqsg
you seem like an earnest person  otherwise that would have been employing some high tier reverse psychology or whatever the correct term is,btohqsg
