The other group talk down on the pennies group but everyday keep sharing MasterYuan charts.Irony,btohqsg
Master yuan in that group also?,btohqsg
A lot of our info is shared in that group,btohqsg
They have clones to forward the charts to their groups,btohqsg
But they take it as their own,btohqsg
"Then they add in their ""expert"" opinions hahahs",btohqsg
i think buying lion gold is like buying toto,btohqsg
Quote of the day-copyChart - copyOpinions - copy,btohqsg
i bought some tho but i think no chance one la,btohqsg
just incase it moves i wanna be part of it,btohqsg
You all sell only few ping,btohqsg
One thing they didn't copy is they flip prata and say our group is the kkj group,btohqsg
nothing to down la this one lol,btohqsg
I got see before direct copy stockcham analysis and paste there one,btohqsg
But not forwarded just copy paste,btohqsg
They got some clones here la,btohqsg
Hahhaha.. Alot ppl say to buy  but put very minimum.. Haha.. I almost wan to try but my broker say it look like on the verge of bankruptcy.. Tell me to think abt it,btohqsg
Anyway they are the biggest group haha,btohqsg
But I think the owner got agenda one la,btohqsg
Now charge money for ads etc le,btohqsg
ya a lot of ppl say the company gg too,btohqsg
hahah but hard to say leh. mayb got prc investors,btohqsg
Full of clones and fake acc,btohqsg
So not sure if ‚Äúlargest ‚Äú,btohqsg
I am inside but I really see nothing useful in there,btohqsg
Here we have 4.6k and 1k onlineThere almost 11k and 800 online,btohqsg
ABL 2013 crash . L for LionGold . This one very hard to move . Plenty of shares issued out .,btohqsg
haha i maxed out my my limit liao,btohqsg
so i have to sell first tmr,btohqsg
I have this back then and averaged down   still holding . but I don‚Äôt encourage anyone to buy this LG,btohqsg
Alot ppl say buy medtec tmr... Hahaha,btohqsg
you see those 2 chart i send... i buy 121 gambling on falling wedge resistance turn support,btohqsg
My friend told me he buy when it like 60cent.. Then he hamji.. Earn small profit n sell,btohqsg
I think most people already load and ready for tomorrow Liao,btohqsg
true  they are the biggest group..,btohqsg
Tomorrow is just chasing another new high,btohqsg
Please don't remind me of the times I bought 192 and 194,btohqsg
It so funny to look at liongold chart. 3 years traded at 0.1 to 0.2 cts.. Except for a short period reach 0.3cts,btohqsg
ya u go check the heart beat of the corpse,btohqsg
Lol getting witty like bro furion ah,btohqsg
Base on ur chart  tp $1.98  can hit $2.88 wor,btohqsg
dont worry  i will hold with u,btohqsg

That should help to gap up the counter tomorrow morning,btohqsg
Abundance tmr target 44/45. Huat ah,btohqsg
SJ got one super longist  Longtermer  aiming $4,btohqsg
Wah suddenly all the skyhigh TP surfacing up again,btohqsg
Yes  pls look at the time frame,btohqsg
Nope  sold too early start of the year .,btohqsg
I thought you re entered you scared me for a moment,btohqsg
I always remember you as a micro penny expert haha,btohqsg
Serious.. U mean can hit 4.50?,btohqsg
but it seem quite accurate for now,btohqsg
Maybe you try holding 2 years then you will know the answer,btohqsg
W3 early 2021 4.17 let‚Äôs see again next year,btohqsg
Wow  very optimistic. Vested but I happy for it to test 0.036 and decide from there.Charlie and Dora probably getting ready to sell when Abundance runs past 36 too. Need to watch for that,btohqsg
Hahaha.. If it really hit 4  let go out for coffee. Hahahahah!,btohqsg
Yea that‚Äôs why my 1000 lots Medtecs average was at $0.0475 and sold $0.06. üò≠,btohqsg
Can put small amount  say 1 or 2 lots  to hold long term lor if one really believes in the $4 vision,btohqsg
coffee? siao lang go vegas alr,btohqsg
Reasonable to use The MT profits  keep 10-20 lots to play play see how far it can go,btohqsg
I very sure mystic got buy 1000 lots of such micro penny and not all turn out to be good,btohqsg
Medtecs is like a jackpot that one can't expect unless you hindsight,btohqsg
So no Sayang or Sayang one in all honesty,btohqsg
Yup of course. Everyone who played long enough has been burnt in some ways .Especially in the ABL 2013 penny crash.,btohqsg
Yup  looked past this. Ultimately  doing what one has passion for and being rewarded is the best feeling.,btohqsg
Am no micro penny player myself but I think key to micro penny plays is to take profit once hit your TP,btohqsg
I like this group leh.. Really so positive and knowledgable  :),btohqsg
Unless you really got vision like Jerry haha,btohqsg
Double vision is also a vision,btohqsg

Here got few good spotters when BB action is traced sometimes retailers make the first move BB will follow suit,btohqsg
Yup  that‚Äôs what we are trying to accomplish.We spot correct . Hit them   can help hasten the process.Because they already planned to run it when they lined their Q . We just jump start for them the engine,btohqsg
Yup that's what I observe as well but I am no micro penny player so just watch show only haha,btohqsg

Hi! Anyone using interactive brokers? I have been using CIMB for awhile  but the platform fees really quite exp. so thought of changing.,btohqsg
Advice to new traders:You‚Äôre not going to get rich quickDon't hop from system to systemHave a planned exit for every tradeLimit your loss to a fraction of your capitalYour entry is only a small part of the equationThe early years are for learning  profits come later,btohqsg
Thank u shifu... tmrw onward i do paper trade on the buy call here and see if it workedüëåüëç,btohqsg
Can we set up a channel for all the buy call for easy refer   thank,btohqsg
Thanks for the suggestion. Will thinks about that,btohqsg
Latest buy call today should be John Ng on CFM at $0.033Let‚Äôs see if it works out. Took 400 lots at TAC too.,btohqsg
I paper trade first ... what is the price to entered? Thank u üëå,btohqsg
I‚Äôm in q for this @32/33 hope can get lol. üôè Hope,btohqsg
Price 0.032/0.033 earlier.Depends on yourself.If same price or can get 0.032 should be okay.,btohqsg
Okok thank u will see chart and decide,btohqsg
There were sellers pop back up earlier at 0.033 when I cleared 350 lots at TAC .Have to see what BBs want tomorrow.,btohqsg
How you know bb is in? Thank,btohqsg
This counter gonna Run tml probably you can try q now,btohqsg
Thank u. I only paper trading,btohqsg
See the call accuracy first üëçüëç,btohqsg
Yea trade at your won comfort bro. Slowly.,btohqsg
Spot the buying patterns. Retailers buying and BBs buying different.,btohqsg
Is it those 100 shares trades,btohqsg
Yup  or manually done by group . Can‚Äôt be too sure. As long as you follow strong hands . Chances to win will be higher.,btohqsg
Those 9800 shares    vs 10000 shares... 9800 more likely to be retail who running out of bullet? üòÇ,btohqsg
Depends but I would think the opposite . I think human beings prefer to buy nicer whole numbers,btohqsg
Penny very fast up very fast down,btohqsg
If run  yea. If drop also lose,btohqsg
Did u buy bck samko too? Rmbr last wk u hv sell at 0.033,btohqsg
Yea better to spot and play the liquid ones. Illiquid ones   only if it is really undervalued and have money to hold,btohqsg
Many stocks are bullish  and when we bought them  they fell miserablyüòø,btohqsg
Was in Q to do so but argh. Withdrawn after some thought and looking at the ew chart. Thought maybe might retrace w2 and maybe try to aim for w3. Wrong move I guess,btohqsg
hmmm so must do homework and buy camp for bullish.usually when bullish already  people already done their homework and sell to you.,btohqsg
Depends  good that you YouTube Rayner teo on stop loss etc. He gives a good guide,btohqsg
Yup yup.Have to Go in early and try to predict stocks that can perform due to macro factors  government deals etc,btohqsg
Yea   not too near to support too. A little further. So that won‚Äôt too easily get stoped out. It happens quite often,btohqsg
Anyways good night and rest well for tomorrow . It should be an interesting week. I believe pennies should go back to rotational play. We will know soon enough.,btohqsg
Same..sell too early thinkin it wont go 0.034 since i see there alot of seller pressing it down at 0.033 üò¢,btohqsg
"This apparently fraudulent group with unreasonable moderation has 4600 members only and 49 online. They still dare to continuously attack us. Anyway  most of them are a syndicate and are in cahoots with each other including ""GEM"" who is male anyway...",btohqsg
They themselves have admitted they are pushing penny stocks and using members in their unethical chatgroup to push prices. We cannot let the attacks on our group go on especially that GEM man who pretends to be separate from them but is actually in cahoots with them. With this said and addtessed  we will leave it to their bad karma to see what will happen to their horrible group.,btohqsg

Dont copy their stuff over please,btohqsg
Aspen is all hype as they are new to glove industry and factory only up next year. And then  they will need time to build economies of scale  not to mention solving production hiccups along the way.Just personal opinion.,btohqsg
they only need 6 months to build the facility. while TG boss says normal new companies need 1 year+++ to build and even stabilize. That should mean something liao.,btohqsg
Realized profit is always better than paper profkt,btohqsg
And now the CMCO in msia  any adverse effect on the progress?,btohqsg
1. previously also got mention  Aspen has MOU with Malaysian govt linked companies that does investment. Will be easy for them to have access to govt n overseas market.2. recently Malaysia CPF invested in glove counters. Now Aspen has a few phases  next phase 1b or phase 2 they will be seeking capital funding. Guess who likely will fund them now?,btohqsg
MT1.43 will be wiped out soon,btohqsg

think BB will let you have the cake below 40 cents? lol.. BB also see price action n opportunity too... when ppl start buying n loading Aspen they will grab that opportunity n pump prices up liao,btohqsg
Really someone one mouth remove all 1.43 sell queue,btohqsg
aspen not specialist in doing healthcare product  i wont use my money invest on something on high risk. i rather use my money to invest on counter that are experience or specialist. bear in mind aspen still need money to cover their loss on construction sector,btohqsg
Got wall then got people wont buy mah  they will think ai ya no profit hard to go up. Then those who chiong later will see wall removed. Then all set sail.,btohqsg
So we can attract strong players,btohqsg
If weak players very sian one,btohqsg
wow the wall in MT is amazing,btohqsg
buy with knowledge not gamble habit,btohqsg
they arent really making loss... you definitely nv even check their financial report... assets end of the day are still assets  they have buildings,btohqsg
and like u said  it's healthcare products!! its not techology where patent and designs are important. LOL...,btohqsg
Wah MT wall so thick until 150,btohqsg
when price moving up  some seller Q will auto withdraw,btohqsg
"u can put ur money into TG UG RS those above $1.. haha..Aspen u can wait till $1 liao then put... for those ""risk"" taker can take now at 18 cents",btohqsg
Many ways   one would be size of order.Look at the single order yesterday 500 lots at 315 . Within next 15 mins 325 clearedUsually Retailer don‚Äôt buy or collec like that,btohqsg
MT 1.6+Today !Let‚Äôs move up !,btohqsg
let reader to decide  i saw their Q2 result is making loss,btohqsg
which industry besides medical not making loss during covid.. LOL! if not making loss why would Aspen look into diversifying and entry to glove,btohqsg
"im saying look at overall company prospect. they have buildings. just base on Q2 u said they are ""loss making"" dont make sense.. if really loss making  u think ppl will invest in them to diversify into glove?",btohqsg
Wah MT 1.5 got chance today,btohqsg
how many companies bankrupted cuz of covid. why would ppl still willing to invest in Aspen. and its also a Tan Sri  more famous in investment further.,btohqsg
its not too late to invest when they making profit again,btohqsg
"yea.. thats why i said u can wait till $1 then invest.those ""risk"" taker can grab some now at 18 cents",btohqsg

Why dont invest in Aspen now?,btohqsg
i mean their share price was $9  then he did split share thats why its $3 now..,btohqsg
Why he delete his post? Haiz,btohqsg
TG is evil... to me...first split share  then buy back shares under company  then transfer shares to the Tan Sri  then now declare special dividends..So much money goes to 1 man pocket. lol.,btohqsg
