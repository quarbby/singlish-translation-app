Only 2 banks are available for such transfer.Citi bank and Dbs,btohqsg
Didn't u post a link on points transfer partners?,btohqsg
I can't find under transfer in kris pay anymore,btohqsg
Why not just convert UNI$ to KF miles then top-up to KrisPay if needed?,btohqsg
I mean the ophan points will still be there after transferring the points to kris flyer SQ,btohqsg
He probably wants to save on transfer fees (note that there is a haircut amount if transferring direct to KrisPay),btohqsg
15% haircut not worth also 🤪,btohqsg
Bro Joseph. Already canr transfer direct to kris pay..,btohqsg
Every uob 5000 UNI = 10k miles.If I have 25k uni. Then remaining 5k unable to transfer to kris pay and also kris flyer account.,btohqsg
5000 UNI = 10k miles. So why the remaining 5k cannot transfer?,btohqsg
Sorry bro. Typing error. 24k.Remaining 4k can't transfer,btohqsg
Then you spend more to make up that 1k uni$ loh. What’s hard to understand,btohqsg
Hi - I had recently wired 3 cash transactions to my interactive brokers account. Two went through and one didn’t. Now it’s been over one week and the funds are still missing from my account. I’ve messaged them and tried to escalate via their portal. Has anyone had a similar issue with IBKR?,btohqsg
View that it is 67k for apr mab. Can get bonus interest in jun if already topup to 150k at end Apr?,btohqsg
are they all from the same place / same method?,btohqsg
which account are you talking about?,btohqsg
Make up 1k UNI$ will end up another 4k UNI$ left..,btohqsg
UOB One pays interest based on actual MAB.. doesn't matter what your previous month MAB is,btohqsg
If top up to 150 in end apr  your may mab should be 150k if there’s no other transactions. So you will get the full 4% in the payout in June,btohqsg
Oh ok. Becos cannot view current mab. Or can the current mab be view at uob app?,btohqsg
Why need to view if you don’t have any transactions?,btohqsg
To ensure that the mab is 150k,btohqsg
if 30th apr you have $150k.you didn't touch anything in May 2024.I guarantee you that your May 2024 MAB will be at least $150k.,btohqsg
Exactly  if you alrd have 150k in end apr. Why wouldn’t your may mab be 150k?,btohqsg
Hello  can check how long do I have to stay with giga before I can port to zym?,btohqsg
Have u checked with the bank?,btohqsg
i just port over from singtel due to the high fees compared to other MVNO.. but zym mobile dont allow direct port over from singtel.. heard there is usually 1-2 month period before can port out again. so wanna confirm on it,btohqsg
and to be clear..it was sent from your OWN account into your OWN interactive brokers?names must match fully,btohqsg
Oh ok  so there is no way to view current mab?,btohqsg
Yes I made two previous transactions which went through via DBS,btohqsg
don't think any bank has this..those of us who want such details  use our own Excel,btohqsg
Then I made a third same method. DBS confirmed it went through I have my bank statement to prove it - but funds still not reflected,btohqsg
then you should provide the refernce number of the 3rd transaction to Interactive Broker for them to urgently follow up,btohqsg
Wanted to check if anyone has had this experience,btohqsg
Yes I have. But their contact system is not very helpful,btohqsg
how they calculate MAB when not end of month yet??,btohqsg
you can still view the current mab,btohqsg
Oh ok  so can only view may mab during first of jun?,btohqsg
never heard of the 1-2 month period,btohqsg
number porting can only be done once every 3 months,btohqsg
