Hi guy   can I ask my wife malaysian currently waiting for her PR to approve and she just renew her passport. Do I have to update to ICA for the new passport info ?,btohqsg
U are talking about PR and renewal of passports while waiting for pr to get approval.But this group is about BTO leh bro,btohqsg
Anyways just for your info u need to update ICA .And fyi my wife is PR already last time is LTVP,btohqsg
Does anyone know how much it would cost to add each floor?,btohqsg
Hi  would like to ask if after an application  I want to reassess income  how would it work? There are some changes. Will it even be allowed? If it is allowed and we get a lot  will it be going through the original HFE or the revised HFE?,btohqsg
Hm.. so weird.. but it’s also not possible that my income is >$7k..,btohqsg
It's household income. If ur occupiers are working their income will be counted together too,btohqsg
I’ve only got my partner and i as co-owners and no other listed occupiers :”),btohqsg
Then it's the income ceiling issue and not glitch  that's is why cannot book 3 room,btohqsg
Hmmm  interesting. Thanks for the reply!!,btohqsg
not sure anymore man  got mixed replies when i saw someone ask about it. some people are saying that once the hfe is processed  there will be no reassessments even for the hdb loan aspect…,btohqsg
Depends on block and is there any unblocked views or even next time any plans of building any higher flats this will determine..It range from  few Ks to even $10-20K,btohqsg
Omg if 45 floor then is $450k,btohqsg
U can check the pricing on the launch ya,btohqsg
Is like example4rm flat up to level 20300K - $450KMeans level 2 is 300K level 20 is 450Kn,btohqsg
So u can estimate which level at which price,btohqsg
1kA blk on different floor the price will jump after witch it 1k each floorIf find different numbers means the unit could have come with OCS for SBF,btohqsg
Hello helloDo anyone know whether this time round   the Feb bto has any units with balcony ?,btohqsg
My BTO site i take level 8  level 9 difference is alot because of MCSP. And other blocks is difference,btohqsg
U can see my level 8  is $385K  level 9 is below is $396K is almost 9K difference. Why? Because level 8 is same height as the roof garden. Then level 9 is above so got 100% unblocked views,btohqsg
Usually the jump bigger for lower floorFor example  level 3 can + up to 20 kLevel 4 + $15 kLevel 5 + $10 kLevel 6 to level 10 $3 k per floorLevel 10-20 $2.5 k per flooorLevel 30 to 40 $1 k per floorSecond highest and highest floor same price,btohqsg
Just want to clarify  if I apply for this time round SBF. Would I still keep my number from last year nov BTO?,btohqsg
Yes. But if you select a unit in SBF or Nov BTO  any on hand ballot numbers will be forfeited,btohqsg
Yes but number with in supply system will block you from applying,btohqsg
My number is like 14xx  only 6xx units. But under MCPS.,btohqsg
High chance might not get the chance to pick. Just worried that HDB will force us to give up before we get the chance to even try.,btohqsg
Mine is 1110 out of 600 units for dec23. I asked HDB via my correspondence and they called me back. Basically told me I can apply for feb24 as my dec23 queue number was out of supply. They also told me I can appeal to waive off non selection count if I do get called to book flat for dec23 afterwards. So no worries and good luck!,btohqsg
Right  because it was outside the supply and more than 30% which is the usual rejection rate. Could appeal to waive off.,btohqsg
Is there really a need for HFE for flexi?,btohqsg
My parents will downsize from their 4rm to flexi which will easier be fully paid w/o any loan..,btohqsg
I think regardless whether ur taking a loan or not  u have to apply for HFE. Please correct me if I am wrong.,btohqsg
Regardless if taking loan or no loan hdb now requires u to do HFE and get approval letter before u can apply,btohqsg
If i apply feb 2024 BTO. and if march got OBF and i manage to secure a queue where i can select flat  how to go bout there on ah?,btohqsg
Hi yes I’m curious about this too. My HFE loan (expires in June 2024) is only $200k and I receive a queue number for a 4rm bto  appointment will be in April onwards. Understand that with the current HFE loan  I won’t be able to afford the 4 rm flat even after grants (still amounts to $300k++)? Wondering if i should reapply for HFE since there is a change in income for both my partner and I the past 3 months… and if we don’t  does it mean that during our Bto appointment we will have to forgo the unit since we can’t technically afford it with the current loan?,btohqsg
Do let us know in this group if you manage to find the answer. My partner and I have been trying to get clarification for this as well..,btohqsg
i did receive this piece of info in early January. Not sure if it is a definite that there is no reassessment  as there is still that option to do so on the HDB website (a request for reassessment),btohqsg
Hi alls  I just got off a call with a HDB Relations Officer with regards to another income reassessment prior to key collection. (I’m also 1 student & 1 working but both will be working by 2026.)The officer said don’t have. The first assessment is the only assessment.I emphasised even with a significant increase in total income (from 2k+ to 9k  they will still say no).The officer also said HDB will not stop anyone from purchasing a flat even if its outside of your budget or if you have a low loan with your current HFE.Just need to be prepared to pay the shortfall in cash as one lumpsum during key collection.In the event you cannot save enough cash by key collection  they will refer you to their management and discuss the possible options to take from there.,btohqsg
Hello my aunty apply sbf but application scheme put her as first timer singleShe is over 70 applying mature estate 2 roomWill the application scheme course her to be NA?,btohqsg
all 4+ rooms application rate >1 for first-timer  seem like Feb24 more people applied compared to Dec23..,btohqsg
Punggol application also good even far from nearest MRT/LRT,btohqsg
What do you mean in your last paragraph?,btohqsg
I worry as single first timer my aunty can't apply mature estate 2 room as it states on the websiteFirst-Timer Singles is N.AManaged to call HDB their reply was senior over 55 years oldCan apply SBF in mature estate 2 room at short lease <99,btohqsg
Can leh I thought PM change stance already?,btohqsg
hdb just called me and told me if you have a loan amount as a student in your hfe bc you worked part time you will not be eligible for deferred income assessment,btohqsg
More of gov reduce the supply due to lower demand  so application rate will go up due to lesser units offered  like 175 units for Tanglin halt.Total only 4 k BTO flatsPast few launches easily 5-7 k units,btohqsg
Interesting to see u view it this way. I view it opposite of you.  I see it in a way is because gov stopping pple from anyhow bto. That’s why rates are low.,btohqsg
He is saying why rate for Feb 24 is higher than Dec 23So this is the explanationGov stopping people to BTO once has queue number already started from Oct 2023 already.3rd launch since Oct 2023Rate likely stabilised,btohqsg
this launch 5 714 in total..in term of total units not big different  but the spread quite big diff  last Dec23 a lot of projects <1,btohqsg
