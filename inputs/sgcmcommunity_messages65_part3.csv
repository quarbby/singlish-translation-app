so loan at 90% vs loan at 60%,btohqsg
Probably already factored in or in t&c,btohqsg
90-100% loan interest is probably 3.5 to 4%?,btohqsg
in anyways  if u cant afford the loan  means u probably cant afford the car. Dont do this kind of illegal things (change loan amount/ lie to the bank) cos if u are the sueysuey one MAS decide to make u the example ah  GG,btohqsg
Some families need car  but no cash savings,btohqsg
There may be a lower one for other credit institutions,btohqsg
Ya‚Ä¶so if cannot pass  it‚Äôs fine,btohqsg
I mean after all its the dealer and credit firm that say can take 100% loan,btohqsg
all got catch one haha  ppl need feed family also,btohqsg
aiya my fullcash is not even some people downpayment,btohqsg
We thot that jus give it a try to see if we can secure a loan and din expect there will be more finer details and how it works,btohqsg
i am the kind to walk into a showroom just to eat their free food,btohqsg
ok la that time when the new swift sport was released me and my friend walk in just to drive and zao lul,btohqsg
Yup its kinda undertable even though they advertise openly. Im not exactly 100% sure of the rulings but just tread carefully.,btohqsg
Lol I tried to buy a 86 using full cash before COVID  the dealer don't even wanna entertain me,btohqsg
But u put deposit already  u may have to sacrifice that,btohqsg
Actually dealers prefer u take loan,btohqsg
They earn money from loan commission,btohqsg
And whether u pay up or not its not their taiji,btohqsg
Even if you damn rich  they still ask you to take loan,btohqsg
Even AD also ask to take min loan to cover the loan discount for the car,btohqsg
Then they earn a from the comm side,btohqsg
My ex FIL wanted to pay full in cash  and the dealer said he will had to pay more to cover the comms ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
if uw full cash can hear the hesitation in their voice one,btohqsg
Ya if you want pay full cash jolly well importn your own vehicle,btohqsg
Not uncommon. They can also say no discount cos cash payment they earn less,btohqsg
But but.. Wo yao mai GTR!!!!! üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Are there any sg car detailing telegram/fb/??? groups around?,btohqsg
Most dealer tells me usually full loans are taken by phv because they dun wan to fork out heavy down payment  so it's like paying rent  but the breakeven is very very far especially when you're calculating the money you can get back after paying the loan. E.g if for some reason you claim insurance for the car (insurance only pays the market value of the car) or you need to sell off the car  you will still need to pay the difference between market value and remaining loan will still have to pay  and this difference is likely very very high.,btohqsg
So it's still better to meet the 30% down payment than to pay nothing at all,btohqsg
If you dun wan to take the risk  pray that the loan is not approved lolz or forfeit the 1k...better lose the 1k than to get into the financial mess later on,btohqsg
The dealer didn't explain the above to you prior to signing? That's not very ethical isn't it?,btohqsg
40% still applicable for cat b cars? üòÖ i think sg cars should not allowed more than 50% loans given the fact cars are only to last 10yrs.,btohqsg
There was a time when overtrade was the in-thing. Mark up new car price so that you can take higher loan amount when the car value is much lower.,btohqsg
tot there are  full loan 0% down.hugher interest,btohqsg
If every family needs a car  then sg gov will have a tough time satisfying the meritocracy spirit. Cause there are many well-to-do families having more than one cars in their households. üòÇ so better to advocate the same ABSD concept on coe üòú,btohqsg
most ppl dun have the means to full cash buy car in sg . not like the rich PRC. buy house aso full cashüòÇ,btohqsg
Very true. The influx of wealth from external sources are what kept the sg economy strong,btohqsg
cannot alot of our mps minister wife 1 car . husbands 1 car. kids 1 car eachüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Well they can buy properties to keep up the ownerships. One house one car lor,btohqsg
please suggest to the miw in public foeumüòõ,btohqsg
Those staying hdb with more than one cars are the ones that gov need to curb,btohqsg
Full cash of car is only if u buy direct 2nd hand from car owner or from tesla,btohqsg
But they also likely have more than one property,btohqsg
Even the household benefits that gov gave out also not the best allocation. Esp if those owning more than one property. $100 for every household mean that some get more üòè,btohqsg
Tax to them is nothing lah.,btohqsg
Esp if they already own hdb and later on private properties.,btohqsg
Too much cash dunno where to spend during covid period. Now revenge spending on property  car and travel for someüòÖ,btohqsg
Tax is very important that why they come sg,btohqsg
True. Best value to come here to reduce tax liability,btohqsg
