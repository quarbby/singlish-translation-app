I tot to track journey using simply go apps already enough?,btohqsg
Journey can track via simplygo after u add card,btohqsg
What card did u link with amaze for journey?,btohqsg
Ah I know what u mean ..haha,btohqsg
May as well use the card directly üòÅ. You wont earn any bonus btw.,btohqsg
Yea  the thing is I don‚Äôt think I use the amaze card to tap  so I don‚Äôt know where this transaction coming fromSo I want add amaze card to SimplyGo add n see any journey in that day n time,btohqsg
Unless I accidentally use amaze card to tap  then suckthumb liao,btohqsg
Do you have Android phone? My Samsung phone has amaze card and sometimes it went too close the sensor and triggered the payment.,btohqsg
Hi  I saw my some of my miles accumulated from UOB lady card was deducted away due to card fee ($196).  This one able to waive off? Anyone tried?,btohqsg
Hi Guru   one question . If I pair amaze +citi reward and pay telecom on reoccurring  does it still contribute to the mile ?I understand citi rewards doesn‚Äôt allow reoccurring.,btohqsg
amaze doesnt change the mcc. If citirewards doesnt give points for recurring  it will be same thing when you use amaze,btohqsg
Recurring sometime is processed as offline transactions  so OP actually meant using Amaze to bypass offline to turn the recurring transaction to an online transaction.,btohqsg
Then we will need to look at the nature of the transaction if it in the inclusion list.,btohqsg
can if mcc and merchant not in exclusion list,btohqsg
Hi Everyone Does anyone have a consolidated list where we can use Instarem Amaze combined with City card to get 10x points ?,btohqsg
get the tnc from Citibank on citirewards what is inclusion and exclusion list,btohqsg
It's a blacklist card so it's better to check for what is excluded.,btohqsg
main thing is travel related transaction are excluded. Not including dining unless the resturant is part of the hotel,btohqsg
Have a second card to fill up that gap to get miles from travel related transaction,btohqsg
Just know in general  hotel  airline and coach are not included. These are the big expenses for travel that you dont want to pay with citirewwards,btohqsg
anything gets 10x points so long mcc is not in exclusion list e.g. travel related.,btohqsg
Anyone know how long UOB CC takes to deliver after approval,btohqsg
Mine took 3 days ‚Ä¶ across weekend or PH might take longer,btohqsg
Can always use the digital one first,btohqsg
Uob digital only can pay by mobile wallet  no cvv and date for online trans,btohqsg
Around 4 days applied on 26/10 and get on 30/10,btohqsg
If set up in app .. is it considered recurring credit card payment .. ? for my M1 Broadband payment etc Thanks üôè,btohqsg
where can I check the expiry for my Citi ThankYou Points? Many thanks,btohqsg
ThankYou points have different expiry depending on the Citibank card you hold.For which ones are you asking?,btohqsg
I hold Citi Rewards .. where can I check .. ? I searched the internet without much luck etc,btohqsg
They are valid for 5yrs + 3 months and pegged to the day you got your card. If you cancel  then the points are lost so use them before cancelling.The points will all have the same expiry independent of when you earn them so take note.,btohqsg
cool thanks .. so if my card valid thru year is 2026 .. does that mean till then ?,btohqsg
Bro  I think Anthony gave the better answer which is ask CSO if you cannot remember when you first got the card.,btohqsg
Funny thing about citi is that their card validity can be less than 5 years.My citi rewards has 3 years validity on it. üòÅ,btohqsg

If one has the UOB Preferred Platinum  DBS Women‚Äôs and the Citi Rewards  what‚Äôs the best usage of Citi Rewards to get 4mpd  if anyone has it and knows?,btohqsg
Anything non travel when tagged to amaze,btohqsg
How UOB PPV and DBS WWMC related to Citi Rewards usage? üòÖ,btohqsg
I prefer Citi pts (more transfer partners) but dbs wwmc has a need to accumulate pts fast. Considering those  for online id use dbs wwmc till max the Citi rewards. For offline spend  I would use Citi rewards + amaze to max then use UOB ppv.,btohqsg
Hi Guys  anyone know about Mari credit card. ? Anyone using it ?,btohqsg
Hi all  is it possible to do HSBC EGA giro to SRS account monthly that I requested in GIRO form?,btohqsg
Hmmm. Dont think it works that way. Giro is for paying bill and there is no bill to pay herez,btohqsg
Essentially how to spread out usgae across cards.Example do air tickets through DBS Women‚Äôs and online transactions on both  this way even if exceeding the limits  can accrue points.,btohqsg
If your spending isn‚Äôt much  I would focus on one card to avoid orphan miles:Citi Rewards is best option  since it can be paired with Amaze and can be used for offline things. Disadvantage is the cap.DBS WWMC is least favourable: cannot be paired with Amaze  online only  1 year validity of points. The only advantage among these 3 is its higher cap.UOB PPV in my opinion is useless if used standalone. It has limitations ($5 rounding  mobile contactless or online whitelist MCC) and cap. It‚Äôs best if you are pairing it with UOB VS and UOB Lady‚Äôs  since UNI$ is pooled.,btohqsg
What you are suggesting is a standing instruction to transfer funds from A to B. What hsbc wants is for giro payment to get the billing org to draw funds from EGA,btohqsg
hello guyswhich cards would be better to clock points in FCY spend (dental treatment + haircut in jb)?- HSBC travelone- HSBC revolution- CRMC + Amaze,btohqsg
Crmc i guess if it dont exceed 1k,btohqsg
Ok noted. So it is standing instruction instead of giro.,btohqsg
HSBC Live+ Quarterly cashback is in,btohqsg
Isnt this the max amt? üí™,btohqsg
