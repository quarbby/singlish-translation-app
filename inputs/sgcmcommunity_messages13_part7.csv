No need to experience cos cant afford lol,btohqsg
That‚Äôs bmw. I personally feel they have a lot of tech when one reads and plays more with them. They have a lot of tech and doesn‚Äôt over-hard to show people that they have it. The dash is always kept streamline for one reason that is to reduce driver distractions. Very German Bauhaus.,btohqsg
Agree  a good mix of buttons and touchscreen is needed,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why cannot win the Chinese  they gang up with Biden and hammer the Chinese upside down. Haha,btohqsg
The Chinese are smart. They are now leading the whole world in batt tech and manufacturing.,btohqsg
Yea. I hate it when its totally touchscreen. All e fingerprint n stuffs.And worst is u cant do changes on the go,btohqsg
u can get used to it,btohqsg
just voice command and a few important button,btohqsg
agreed! thankfully mazda isnt fully touch screen.. wheewwüòÆ‚Äçüí®üòÆ‚Äçüí®,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt really button and a gear box,btohqsg
But if u insist to press on some thing u can buy button,btohqsg
But buttons just easier on the roads,btohqsg
And if I'm going to have to buy buttons for the car  might as well buy a car that comes with buttons in the first place ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also curious re replacement costs tbh‚Ä¶ like my phone screen after a while also got problem .. anyone knows how much ah?,btohqsg
Hahaha voice command.. forget it. My alexa and google home alrdy having difficulty executing commands,btohqsg
Like button I want to save money I just taobao a bit lah or just live with the paint fading,btohqsg
Aft x hrs of usage  screen lcd sure become white  then touch sensitivity decrease n etc,btohqsg
got the side mirror button to adjust,btohqsg
Haha don‚Äôt know but it should not be cheap,btohqsg
Quite ok actuallly practice a bit   I tried like open glove box   open charge port all ok,btohqsg
1 extra button  how nice of them,btohqsg
Lol the only button I need is aircon,btohqsg
And that is the maximum button !,btohqsg
because they are protective of gasoline cars still. but they eventually also gave up because electric is inevitable. the bmw ceo is very defiant.,btohqsg
haha maybe you should try bmws 2017 onwards they prolly have the best if not one of the best systems in the world,btohqsg
not sure what you mean by old  maybe you feel user friendliness is outdated ?,btohqsg
did you read the usa bmw forums. they complain that bmw car prices fall so steep after buying new. the new techs they put in m3 xdrive etc are really not necessary. thye aint tested thoroughly,btohqsg
electric is simplicity. fewest moving parts and more discreet in moving,btohqsg
Dk leh just e feel n interface of it feels outdated. If u compare like merz.,btohqsg
robots  servos motors are all electric  lathe cnc etc,btohqsg
no leh mercedes would be the ones considering the size of their screens are usability,btohqsg
have you sat in a bmw of late sir? and tried the idrive? üôÇ,btohqsg
But it isn't really that much better for the environment due to emissions from battery production  etc. Volvo conducted a study to compare the xc40 ICE and xc40 recharge. They came down to the conclusion that to get to a point where the electric xc40 becomes good for the environment and at par with the ICE car  you would need to drive 140k km,btohqsg
12 years of running in Singapore assuming 12k km per year,btohqsg
Yes  but this is assuming that the electricity you're getting to charge the car is from clean sources as well,btohqsg
If your electricity is coming from burning coal  adds on further,btohqsg
That's why German manufacturers are joining the electric rat race however they are still keeping options open  such as Porsche's research on synthetic fuels,btohqsg
Yup cause eletric gal is a new game altogether all Thier years of research mostly went down to the drains,btohqsg
There is no apple to apple comparison that one can do. Yes your cost might be lower due to the current subsidies and everything. But assume that everyone goes electric  how are governments going to earn the revenue from taxes on fossil fuels,btohqsg
They will just start taxing electricity,btohqsg
Road tax chop carrot head woo hoo,btohqsg
since we are on sg carmart  we can do a quick search to find the answer to that üòä,btohqsg
Bigger picture maybe  around the world!,btohqsg
Road tax for electric only high in Singapore,btohqsg
no no i dont think so. they can tax the rich or other sources.,btohqsg
Yes just chop and tax on charging station,btohqsg
or tax based on road use etc,btohqsg
You already see it happening Mr Arnav. Subsidies will not be forever and especially in any government context.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have to worry about how they charge they sure find a way trust me,btohqsg
the obejctive is to go green and make everyone comply first. focus on this,btohqsg
