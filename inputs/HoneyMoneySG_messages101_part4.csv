u got account for the 46.7 i have to pay monthly ??,btohqsg
ok maybe 6% p.a. then.. that's still pretty decent,btohqsg
Maybe I suggest this   you see if make sense.Keep holding this policy as long as the annual announced (confirm) surrender value is close to the projections. The moment they don't pay as projected  you surrender it (it can't drop below last year's announced value anyway).,btohqsg
lolol wtf this strategy actually sounds quite legit  might consider it myself ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
but HOR i have this policy for 25 years le... so alot is from BOOONUS,btohqsg
well we sort of concluded.. yes the 3.6% p.a. over the last 25 years is so so only.. but because global interest rates were low anyway.Now yes  rates are higher (but might drop)  if they can pay you 6% p.a. ish.. why not right?if you terminate  you still get to keep the bonuses declared right?,btohqsg
dk is it for all customer,btohqsg
actually based on my calculation its about 5.5% pa which is decently high enough if the projected total is correct. currently jumping at 2% a month i think could really hit the projected total even if the fees are significantly higher than other policies. probably need to wait a year to verify since i just got this policy,btohqsg

hi all  my friend has gotten her UOB Lady's credit card through a secured FD. She wants to apply for a 2nd credit card from UOB but does not wish to queue for hours at the branch (that's her experience when she's applying for the lady's card). Wonder if anyone knows if my friend has to go through the application at the branch or she can apply  her 2nd credit card from UOB online banking? She's assuming that the same secured FD allows her to apply for a 2nd credit card from UOB. Appreciate anyone's advice.,btohqsg
Go through cardup/ipaymy or citi payall if have promo,btohqsg
I will look it up! thank you!,btohqsg
Can just apply thru uob tmrw,btohqsg
Usually if u are already customer   its near instant approval. That was the case for me. Coz using same credit limit right?,btohqsg
Hello all  i would like to ask what is the best payment strategy for overseas living inc grocery payment  shopping and transport(deutsche bahn) expenses in germany,btohqsg
noted all. I would have thought so but my friend just told me that she received an email from UOB on her application submitted through UOB TMRW  the officer was requesting for her employment details which she does not have. She wasn't sure why UOB was requesting her employment details even though she has already placed a secured FD...,btohqsg
Just reply homemaker or unemployed  depending what her situation is,btohqsg
Ask her tell the bank officer that she already has secured FD. Not all bank staffs can access all your confidential records.,btohqsg
ok will let her know accordingly. thank you all for the advice!,btohqsg

Am thinking of redeeming ssb. Any different between redeeming now vs end of month since the funds will only be returned to bank early next month?,btohqsg
no difference at all...unless you might change your mind,btohqsg
means likely not received yet?I applied and have gotten application # almost immediately,btohqsg
i applied twice for 2 diff cards and there is no number for me at all,btohqsg
best to check with citi  do you have an existing citi account?can try to use their live chat function  they usually get back within a day!,btohqsg
Reason for asking is im thinking of shifting funds from ssb to syfe cash+ guaranteed. Just wondering  in the future when interest rates get lower  how will cash+ rates change?,btohqsg
If u think rates dropping. Donâ€™t sell ssb. Locked in rates for 10 years.,btohqsg
Was trying to read up on it and i thought when interest rates go down  bond interest goes up. And now we are in a kinda high interest rate environment so if anything  itll likely go down in the future?,btohqsg
