Does anyone know if I can take H2 bio given that I didn't take bio in secondary school?,btohqsg
I want take a level bio as pvt candidate can?,btohqsg
Why do you want to change to h2 bio,btohqsg
I have a family background in medicine and honestly I hate physics,btohqsg
I'd say out of the three sciences  biology is the most content heavy,btohqsg
If you can manage to cram O Level stuff in addition to A Level stuff in the same period then,btohqsg
Have you considered other subjects maybe?,btohqsg
The Biology syllabus is developed as a seamless continuum from O-Level to A-Level  without the need fortopics to be revisited at A-Level. The O-Level syllabus is foundational and thus should provide the necessarybackground for study at A-Level. Students who intend to offer H2 Biology will therefore be assumed to have knowledge and understanding of O-Level Biology  either as a single subject or as part of a balanced sciencecourse.,btohqsg
From what I heard from my friends  they said it was pretty tough,btohqsg
But idk I didn't take bio myself so xd,btohqsg
