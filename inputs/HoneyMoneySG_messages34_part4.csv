"Hi all  asking aboutOCBC GREAT EASTERN CASHFLO CREDIT CARDfor policy payments now that the Grab+Amex combo is axed.1) Is there any card payment that is excluded from the ""across 6 months for transactions of S$1 000 and above"" option?Looked through the TnC and doesn't seem to have any  only exclusions for the cashback.2) For GE products not in their ""*List of eligible products""  it would be considered as the ""For all other payments"" or not eligible for any interest free installments?",btohqsg
I suspect HSBC splits credit limit between their CCs?,btohqsg
FYI there are cards that give cashback and miles for insurance payments. Amex + GPMC is also still a viable option if your insurer accepts direct card payments,btohqsg
