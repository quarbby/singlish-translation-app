HSO broke out of 7year downtrend line on the weekly with decent volume.This month should be last chance to get $0.004. After this month I reckon $0.004 will be hard to get,btohqsg
Investing note got one forumer who gave a broad view of Banker harvesting and planting.  Quite good.  Ochartist. Aka kopisoh. 😂,btohqsg
This is what he/she shared before. I screenshot it last time. Good read.,btohqsg
Senior Chngkay invisible hands for $0.004. That’s why $0.004/$0.005 stable even after Wong Ben Koon sold approx 580 000 000 shares at this price   taking back about $2.4m from open market.And that’s why I believe this one double / multi bag potential,btohqsg
