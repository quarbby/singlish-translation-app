I like how the govt keep trying to make things easier,btohqsg

hey guys what do u think can be done to resolve the issue of crowdedness in public transport ?,btohqsg
this is for my pw project !!,btohqsg
go send me offer only now then say got some party on 13th may (in 2 fking days) and have to accept offer by 24th May,btohqsg
like bro NTU's attitude towards us is way better,btohqsg
thanos snap half of them away,btohqsg
1-more services during peak hrs/whenits crowded2-refurbish design of public transport to be able to accommodate for a larger capacity (C151/KHI has been refurbished from 9 seats a row to 7 and even removed a few rows of sitting for standing space)3-buy more trains and buses etc. to increase capacity (trains such as the C830C (there are a lot more but i dowan say now) have been bought just to increase capacity of the line)4-use larger vehicles (higher usage of double decker and bendy buses ard singapore)5-create dedicated bus/train services/lines to alleviate pressure on older existing lines (CRL is being built to do that for EWL  lunchtime express used to be there at the city centre along the EWL to cater to the extra crowd during lunch time),btohqsg
plus rejection/acceptance date is pretty much 24th May for everyone  i think,btohqsg
like if u reject till 23rd may but accept 24th  neither will it cost u the seat  nor will the uni allocate another person for it,btohqsg

There is a reason why there is so many taxis on the roads  because commercial vehicles like taxis avoid the whole coe system,btohqsg
im not talking about what can be done to reduce coe. thats for another conversation,btohqsg
we need to make use of air taxis from Pasir Ris to Farrer Hill to Boon Lay  3 stops,btohqsg
But that won‚Äôt improve public transport,btohqsg
More cars= more jams= efficiency of public busses drop,btohqsg
