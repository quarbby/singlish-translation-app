The base pay of a crane operator is like 3k  but can rise up to 5K,btohqsg
overseas ppl with no deg can make more,btohqsg
okay with all this talk about qualifications  salaries and jobs I genuinely feel that there is a glaring imbalance in job preferences simply because singaporeans are somehow hardwired to aim for an office job. a white collar job in an airconditioned environment that pays wellwhy???,btohqsg
other countries such as australia and germany really pay their blue collar workers well reaching upwards of 6k a month,btohqsg
thats the hard work of it,btohqsg
dont aim to be doing it when your 40+,btohqsg
siala that means sporeans are used to just sitting and walking..hard labour = low pay = Mid Job,btohqsg

really cant fight with the US...they have a minimum wage model,btohqsg
their base wage means that all employers lawfully should pay ay least $12-15/hr,btohqsg
Without migrant workers we would be kinda fked,btohqsg
This is the reason why...jobs that should be paid more are paid very little,btohqsg
Minimum wage model is the reason why healthcare workers/teachers are going on strike,btohqsg
If you can get a freelance job,btohqsg
to add insult to injury...the US currently do not have the funds to fund its own people,btohqsg
You can make alot of money,btohqsg
