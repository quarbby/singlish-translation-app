Well we anglos did most of the inventions and advancements  however not all of us are so obbssed with studying,btohqsg
we're not necessarily obsessedwe need the practice tho,btohqsg
why do you think we asians only are the ones obsessed with studying?,btohqsg
we're not really that sorta case :/,btohqsg
America is the richest country on earth  most white people are not so obsessed with studying and getting  high marks tho  anyone can do it. It doesn't showcases the real creativity.,btohqsg
"i don't think obsessed is really the right word tooafter all  it's not ""asians""it's just singaporeans are pretty much forced into this education system and are labelled one of the well known & ""better"" systems",btohqsg
Everything around you was created by a white men.,btohqsg
suppose you see the education difference between singapore and america  you wouldn't be surprised with the attitude difference,btohqsg
"Also  grammar it's either ""by white men"" or "" by a white man"". Pick one.",btohqsg
what is this now? racism? white supremacy?,btohqsg
surely the main method but no  not everything is by a white man.,btohqsg
Ok  Sir Stamford Raffles  I'm going to have to stop you right there.,btohqsg

Asians were brutally mogged by the whites,btohqsg
i'm sure you have the wrong word,btohqsg
what in the hell is mog,btohqsg
that earned a laugh from me,btohqsg
Umm  no. The concepts you guys used were laid upon by people of other ethnicities.,btohqsg
the whites have had their advances  their impacts  but in the end  do you see the line that draws between asians and americans since you bring that specific nationality,btohqsg
"Well  we are moving away from the notion that the British guy ""founded"" us so yeah.",btohqsg
Believe anything you want  but don't say that racist here,btohqsg
I'm not undermining your contributions  thank you for being a beneficial race to society  but to fully assert your dominance for your contributions when you utilised concepts from other ethnicities is just an egoistical statement to make.,btohqsg
