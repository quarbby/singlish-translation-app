yijc manages to dominate every category for being the worst,btohqsg
I love when ppl don't clean up their sweaty buttocks stains after they're done using the equipment,btohqsg

Wah i wanted to check out my schs one but need book through cher siah,btohqsg
The guy who go at night,btohqsg
Then got this funny uncle go do everything,btohqsg
Like he‚Äôs in a rush lmao,btohqsg
Then when i try to book they say sch nvr give safety briefing yet so cannot,btohqsg
Other schs like this not üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
I only go there like last year,btohqsg
Eh were u the guy with my senior,btohqsg
my one we just snewk in,btohqsg
Ya but like cause of tht,btohqsg
My friends used to ask me if MSS was affiliated to TMüòÇ,btohqsg
Meridian is too shit to be affiliated to jc,btohqsg
I only talk to this guy from NTU,btohqsg
He was MJC batch so idt its u,btohqsg
Ok to be fair mjc campus is newer than me,btohqsg
Meanwhile help la i told my aunt i may not be able to join her for dinner on 2nd mar  then she keep pushing and pushing me,btohqsg
And keep asking again and again,btohqsg
As if i will change my ans,btohqsg
Bruh i hv interviews + mid terms to study for,btohqsg
Then she be like ‚Äòit is just dinner‚Äô,btohqsg
She meant it is just a dinner  like how will it affect my revision significantly but hmmm,btohqsg
""" EH AUNTIE IF UW ME TO COME FOR DINNER MUST BAO BIG ANG BAO TO SUMMON MY PRESENCE OTHERWISE TATA AUNTIE """,btohqsg
Obv she must do smth rite,btohqsg
Like so what if she's an elder  she still gotta respect your decision wat,btohqsg
Unless there's some fam stuff then idk ah and it's the internet so take it w a pinch of salt cause idk the full story,btohqsg
Good point‚Ä¶i hate the fact whenever i say im busy  she will be like ‚Äòonly u busy ah‚Äô,btohqsg
Yea and it is my time lol,btohqsg
It is v new (2003)  i heard that the principal work very hard to get it compatible to the top schs and cop was I think 10-11 (only to be ruined by TP and pam yoong),btohqsg
Man why are you projecting so much of your thoughts into a public chat lol just curious,btohqsg
Oh so that‚Äôs why you wished it was mjc principal that took over the merged sch,btohqsg
on top of admitting to being an absolute idioy,btohqsg
later i will get canceleld or what,btohqsg
im just laughing at myself tbf,btohqsg
I noticed that for all the merged schs  the principal came from the sch which the campus was not being used for the merged sch,btohqsg
Yea:-(Actually not just the principal  i think tp took most of it sia idk why,btohqsg
u see all the laughing emojis rifht,btohqsg
is laufh at myself and my sch de,btohqsg
Like tmjc used mjc campus and got tpjc principal,btohqsg
Yea:-(Idk if it is fairness or what  but that is nonsense if it got to do w fairness,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs like the ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù moe  gave to preserve the most amount of sch culture from both schs it was a bad choice,btohqsg
They should‚Äôve chosen both the best campus possible and the best principal,btohqsg
tp jc is tamp jc right,btohqsg
Yea coz like they bring in the other principal  end up it will also go one way,btohqsg
I guess for tmjc should‚Äôve used mjc campus and retained mjc principal,btohqsg
Ok i shouldnt be influenced to be troll  yes it is tampinese,btohqsg
Which is actually pretty evident lmao,btohqsg
If Tampines jc came before Temasek Tampines jc would‚Äôve been known as TJC instead lol,btohqsg
Yea and i mean whatever it is  will be a compromise  cant for sure be nicely fit merger  but should choose the best‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Temasek is now using tpjc campus right,btohqsg
Coz the merger came as a v rushed policy,btohqsg
I am not as good a troller as yt,btohqsg
Actually i would prefer if they dun merge and just cut down intake,btohqsg
Uk it is damn stupid that during my batch  they force 1d of orientation to be in tp,btohqsg
My pri school  sec sch  and tjc dam near my house,btohqsg
Nope I grad from tmjc last year,btohqsg

or any number without using calc,btohqsg
u tell me i oso dk,btohqsg
Anyone retook As in combat vocations and got 88+ RP?,btohqsg
i studied this in my math bridging notds yest,btohqsg

He was from ip so i presume yes,btohqsg
i also never heard that term before,btohqsg
HUH IM LEARNING THAT IN H2 MATH DUDE,btohqsg
maybe i know the method just not the term,btohqsg
like it‚Äôs probs smth i‚Äôd learned before just not under that name,btohqsg
and the risk of performing worse alsoüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
you divide but you take your own sweet time,btohqsg
My friend did that while in uni and she scored the same  end up she went australia med  her father sponsor,btohqsg
I hv never done sth like that in my 2y of H2 math,btohqsg
oh i know that method but it wasn't given a name for me,btohqsg
ok ya i know it but not the name,btohqsg
It brings back a fade memory now,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why got the quotation marks,btohqsg
IM LEARNING IT ON FIRST CHAP,btohqsg
i shpw u my h2 math,btohqsg
nvm your dementia worse than andrea,btohqsg
i rmb conics being in my h2 math syllabus,btohqsg
no the equation is very long that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called long division,btohqsg
I still remembered after prelims  tm group ppl base on results  and then chem 1 lt only had 3/4 ppl in my classMath hv like 5/6???,btohqsg
It is based on results i think,btohqsg
Then for chem  3/4 ppl in 1 lt  some in the lousiest one  then maj in the middle,btohqsg
Then for math  5/6 in lt5  the bulk in lt4,btohqsg
The smaller LT is the better one,btohqsg
Then they make us do paper,btohqsg
The other LT the lecturer going through stuff i think?,btohqsg
Did you meet them on telehitch,btohqsg
eh sorry its all called 9758 despite the change oops,btohqsg

can someone help read muh synopsis for a research thingAbstract: This project investigated the effectiveness of various commercial toothpastes against acidic erosion  using clam shells as a substitute for human teeth. We aimed to determine if the advertised benefits of specific enamel-strengthening toothpastes translated to measurable differences in acid resistance among different samples. Coke and vinegar were used to simulate moderate and extreme acid exposure  respectively. Our findings suggest minimal differences in the protective capabilities of the tested toothpastes  highlighting the need for critical evaluation of advertising claims and emphasizing the importance of overall oral hygiene practices.Key Steps in Methods:Sample preparation: Clam shells  cleaned and free of organic matter  were used as proxies for human teeth. Toothpaste samples (Oral-B Gum & Enamel Densify  Oral-B Gum & Enamel Daily Protection  Oral-B Enamel Densify Daily Whitening  Oral-B Enamel Densify Daily Protection) were applied daily for each instance of the experiment.Collection of data: Shells were measured before the start of the experiment which had been left to dry for a day.Acid exposure: Shells were submerged in either coke (moderate acidity) and vinegar (extreme acidity) for 15 minutes daily  aimed to simulate the acid exposure throughout a day and extrapolate the data as such.Brushing and drying: After immersion  shells were rinsed with deionized water and brushed with a standardized toothbrush for 5 seconds on each both the inner and outer surface of the shell. They were left to sit with the toothpaste for 2 minutes  then rinsed with deionized water and left to dry for a day until the next round of experiment.Evaluation: Shell weight was measured before and after the experiment to assess erosion caused by acid exposure. Qualitative data such as Shell texture and colour were also taken note of.Results and Discussion:Minimal differences in weight loss: All tested toothpastes provided similar levels(within 10%) of protection against both moderate and extreme acid exposure  as measured by minimal differences in weight loss between groups.Limited impact of enamel-strengthening claims: The advertised enamel-strengthening benefits of specific toothpastes did not translate to significantly improved acid resistance compared to any other in this study.Importance of overall oral hygiene: While toothpastes play a role  the results underscore the significance of comprehensive oral hygiene practices  including regular brushing  flossing  and dietary choices  for maintaining healthy teeth.Conclusion:This study suggests that the advertised benefits of specific enamel-strengthening toothpastes might not translate to measurable differences in acid resistance among them. While toothpastes contribute to oral health  their effectiveness is limited. Comprehensive oral hygiene practices remain crucial for protecting teeth from the detrimental effects of acidic foods and beverages.,btohqsg
sorry for the wall of text lol,btohqsg
the 3 year bond is only for those who took tutiton loan,btohqsg
