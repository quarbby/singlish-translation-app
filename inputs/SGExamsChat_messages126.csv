The best is always no ns cough,btohqsg
iPhone 4. Where is the iPhone 4? I need an iPhone 4.,btohqsg
U might not even make it into uni,btohqsg
Then this concern is no longer valid,btohqsg
and give me ur notes while ur at it,btohqsg
You dont even take any subjects similar to john smith,btohqsg
At least not A level subjects,btohqsg
Oh shit sorry I saw a smiley face and assumed,btohqsg
Anyway mr Russian guy doesnt even take any subjects similar to you too,btohqsg
Oh no the rsaf weebs have taken over,btohqsg
Can we stop this rsaf sticker pls,btohqsg

Whose great idea was it to put emojis on a plane,btohqsg
I prefer to call itLithium familyBeryllium familyScandium familyTitanium familyVanadium familyChromium familyManganese familyIron familyCobalt familyNickel familyCopper familyZinc family,btohqsg
How to join the other groups,btohqsg
First you got to reach the cavern of despair,btohqsg
anyone feel like they want to do well and put down plans to study but in the end dont carry them out and feel disappointed and frustrated in yourself at the same time,btohqsg
Thats me with everything in general,btohqsg
that's why i go with the flow,btohqsg
Yup but i know a plan will never work so i don‚Äôt make them,btohqsg
my life rly be like the east coast plan speech rn,btohqsg
Omg that‚Äôs a 60+ FPS sticker,btohqsg
Yeah i made it youre welcome,btohqsg
The problem is planning too big,btohqsg
Whatsapp should animate the default emoji like this,btohqsg
i was planning to watch 2 lectures and write a zuowen for a night and ended up watching one lecture and spending the rest of the time watching political rallies,btohqsg
Thought you were gomna say watching netflix,btohqsg
At least you weren‚Äôt gaming or something,btohqsg
That‚Äôs a lot of things to do in one night,btohqsg
considering im 4-5 of lectures behind for math and 2-3 for phys i guess i gotta try to catch up?,btohqsg
I was planning to plan a plan when an unplanned thing happened and I had to drop all my plans,btohqsg
Sure  but u need to be realistic,btohqsg
U can‚Äôt suddenly run 3.2km if uve been running 2.4 your whole life,btohqsg
The trick is to not plan anything,btohqsg
Then whatever you do will exceed expectations,btohqsg
I noticed that you were noticing me so i came here to give you a notice that i noticed you too,btohqsg
Your plans need to be small and easy to do so that you can actually do them,btohqsg
Eg I will do 3 maths questions in one night  or I will plan out 2 essays in one night,btohqsg
Actually kinda true. Once you plan the pressure comes,btohqsg
There is no point in trying to do a lot of things in one day if it just causes you to procrastinate it and u do nothing,btohqsg
Plus not achieving your plans will disapppoint u and lower your morale,btohqsg
But your notice did not come with any prior notice so I did not notice your notice  and now I am notifying you that you should send prior notification so that your notices get noticed.,btohqsg
So u noticed his notice even though there was no prior notice üòê because you are responding to his notice,btohqsg
Sorry for the late reply telegram didnt notify me so i had to check myself whether i have notifications or not and turns out i do have notification maybe i should notify telegram to up their notification game or their family will be notified by my threat,btohqsg
Ye I rather do small tasks everyday than do big tasks for like 3 days,btohqsg
What? Im just tryna see how good he is at doing things,btohqsg
So u think u are a thing,btohqsg
Can we stop this rsaf sticker pls,btohqsg
Replace rsaf sticker with guards sticker,btohqsg
Lucky im not taking it today,btohqsg
In russia the pollution tackle the water,btohqsg
I think even English oral come out also people cannot do,btohqsg
Hi super random here but the Chinese oral topic today is about River Pollution!The video showed a family like in a park with a river and the kid trying to place his paper boat on the river but the mum stop him + the dad picking up garbage!,btohqsg
Is there a crocodile in the park,btohqsg
My first question was If I saw someone doing the same thing as the boy  what would I have done?The second was how do I encourage those around me to avoid polluting the riversThirdly was is the government doing enough to reduce the pollution in rivers,btohqsg
AHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH whAt? I don't think so??,btohqsg
Anyway but essentially yeah I didn't expect river to come out LOL I tried to talk about ÁéØ‰øù in my second question but got shot down by the examiner,btohqsg
My Chinese genuinely sucks so I didn't do that well!!! But it's okay    I'm pulling down the bellcurve for my friends AHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
But I think this oral rlly solidified the fact that I'm not going to retake the paper in during Nov,btohqsg

what are you using the document for,btohqsg
I think that's the most important,btohqsg
so you're trying to translate the official finaid document into another language?,btohqsg
then I think you should find a credible and recognised translator,btohqsg
I tried but all need to pay,btohqsg
if the handwritten translation looks professional enough  I think they'll accept it,btohqsg
you have the pdf file for the document?,btohqsg
I can do it for you but your personal information will be exposed,btohqsg
there's pdf editors online that you can use as well,btohqsg
since you have to pay for adobe,btohqsg
I think they'll understand if it's handwritten for such documents,btohqsg
don't think you can edit such a cert..,btohqsg

Ah yes those 2 things pretty much shot pap in the foot even though they weren't the main focus of the election,btohqsg
And the debate was very good for him,btohqsg
It showed Singapore that he was worthy,btohqsg
He was a post doc in harvard though,btohqsg
The thing is he was an economist at the world bank,btohqsg
PAP said that they were ‚Äòwilling to pay the political price‚Äô for those controversial decisions,btohqsg

not really my own experience! (since i didnt ite>poly)but i do have a couple of  close friends (about 4 of them  whom i went thru poly with)all of them went thru the higher nitec > poly route.1-2 of them went to nitec succeed in promoting to higher nitec and subsequntly entered poly :)in a nutshell  it's definitely difficult (i mean  studying per se is inherently difficult. unless you're a genius then hats off to u)however  with hardwork and asking for help etc frm lecturers and friends  3 of them managed to clear poly with a decent gpa(engineering course)one proceeded to SIT while 2 signed on. (both air force as an AFEM) they couldve made it to a local U if they wanted to tho.the other one barelypassed. he's one who has a 'pass can alr' attitude. didnt want help from anyone and everyone.1.0 is the min. to clear poly right? yes he just that 1.xpersonally i felt that he could've done alot more better but to each his own i guess.poly is a place that allows you to be more independent in a sense you have quite alot of free time (def depends on your course too! )so i belive with proper planning and time management  its not all doom and gloom :),btohqsg
hope this helps u in whatever decision you're trying to make! üòä,btohqsg
the stupid thing is its a saturday,btohqsg
