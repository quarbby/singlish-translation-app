You expect more people to come in   hence you buy,btohqsg
You expect price to go up further   hence you buy,btohqsg
For its upcoming good profit and result ...,btohqsg
Given time  due to the scare now china going through  they will relax their coal outputs next few years. And this will definitely dampen the prices in the medium term.,btohqsg
