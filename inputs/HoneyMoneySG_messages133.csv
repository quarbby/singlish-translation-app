Can‚Äôt say this. U always have a choice.Honestly to expect 3.xx% pa and above for close to risk free. Is not sustainable in long run.,btohqsg

Wow  the more you know. I searched back history and saw it was mentioned is 4112  so I thought it was excluded,btohqsg

It is far from 6.8%.Also it seems 6.8% rate is based on trading days (Monday to Friday) out of the 60 days. On weekends will not earn 6.8% am I correct?,btohqsg

I don‚Äôt know if I should apply DBS yuu.. I worried can‚Äôt meet the $600 monthly because most of the merchants there I didn‚Äôt spend except SingTel bills.,btohqsg
You have answered your own question.üòÜ,btohqsg
The card is not for you if you have to worry about this. Don‚Äôt get yourself trapped.,btohqsg
then don't apply.Unless u willing to change your spending habit. To shop at giant/ cold storage and foodpanda.,btohqsg
plus there is no guarantee that nerfing doesn't happen soon/in the future,btohqsg
Haha.. Okok. I hold off for now.,btohqsg
Hi all can i ask regarding the DBS yuu card..some say can use it to make payment for singtel bill?but in the exclusion say cannot..so was wondering can or cannot?,btohqsg
So technically if you on Singtel Kiosk you can count it as part of it..,btohqsg
Hi sorry for late reply. U need to download Liquid Pay app and login to withdraw the funds through a PayNow transaction to yourself or transfer to a supported e-wallet (Singtel Dash or GrabPay) that is owned by you,btohqsg
For everyone's information. I just double checked with Tiger Brokers online support. It seems tiger brokers effective rate is not 6.8% for 60 days but for 60 trading days. So weekends and public holidays do not get the boost  only get Philips MMF return which is currently about 2.8% / annum only.,btohqsg
42 trading days 6.8% (with boost)18 non trading days 2.8%Effective rate around 5.6% / annumBut it is still better than moomoo's 6.8%,btohqsg
4.8% is only if there are no returns earn on non trading days . You need to add the returns made from Philips MMF on weekends roughly 2.8% to calculate effective rate.,btohqsg
Do you have tag of 6mpd for hotel?,btohqsg
It's been a long time so I lost the confirmation page üòî,btohqsg
I read is 3 months after stay,btohqsg

Has anyone received the rewards yet? When will we receive it ah?,btohqsg
They are very slow  last year I participated in their 5.8% NDP promotion  despite chasing repeatedly  their time frame to credit only around 35 days after your 30 days ends. Not 14 business days,btohqsg
Okok thanks so much. Did u withdraw and place the funds elsewhere?,btohqsg
Any guru know when GXS boost pocket promotion of 3.48% will be expiring?,btohqsg

Hi Gurus! I like to check on HSBC EGA Everyday+ Reward. I have just open the EGA with $2k in Sep. I want to use this account mainly to earn cashback on the giro payment. My question is whether I need to inject fresh funds of $2k monthly and if I can withdraw money over time for me to continuously enjoy the Everyday+ Rewards every month. I am unsure if withdrawing money will affect the cashback in Oct if I withdraw money out of EGA.,btohqsg
You can withdraw the 2k after depositing in,btohqsg
Great! Thanks for the info. Now I know I don't need to keep pouring money into the account. üòä,btohqsg

Anyome know why i am not earnomg cashback on maribank cashback card. I have been using it for months and mainly funding shopee purchases. Used it a few times via gpay for mobile purchase too,btohqsg
I recall Maribank cc cashback for shopee as shopee coins. Did u not get any?,btohqsg
Yes i get the coins. But it also says cashback for purchases. I also used it for mobile purchases via gpay. I checked app on cashback history and it says i never earned any cashback,btohqsg
Can clarify what's the purchased amt. Mari bank did state in the t&c that they will round down the value to the nearest cents. So might be it got rounded down to $0?,btohqsg
Roughly 200 to 250 per mth,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt change to margin in Webull as it states I have unsettled funds,btohqsg
Must I sell all my existing stocks perhaps ?,btohqsg
You already got the coins for shopee transactions  but not the cashback? You said you added to GPay  mobile contactless??,btohqsg

What  credit cards to use for paying travel agencies eg chan brothers?,btohqsg
depends on amount. UOB KF via Kris+ is an option,btohqsg
gd point  didn't realize Chan Bros is a Kris+ merchant,btohqsg
be careful.. mcc on Kris+ is 7991 (Tourist Attraction)..not under UOB Lady Travel category.,btohqsg
Chan bro can spilt payment upon request de,btohqsg
yup they are quite understanding.. even my downpayment i split into multiple cards,btohqsg
Anyone know if e-giro for HSBC also entitled to 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Looks like UoB KF does not support Apple Watch,btohqsg
But don‚Äôt see any articles say UoB KF does not support Apple Watch,btohqsg
I'm sure it does. I'm using on my watch to pay mrt rides,btohqsg
we are able to open an account online  is that correct? eGiro/Giro just have to download forms and what not and do we have to submit them physically?,btohqsg
Giro needs to send physical form to cc banks  not HSBC bank. And you need to go down to HSBC to register signature for giro to work.,btohqsg
Ya must head down to hsbc bank to register signature. Previously my giro rejected cos no signature. And u need to bring physical nric if not can't register signature. They don't accept Singpass one.,btohqsg

is anyone using SC Smart Credit Card? applied and got the card approved yesterday. im able to use the digital one on my phone but adding the card to my family member's phone and using it doesn't work. also  online txn on amazon got declined too. any reason why? does the digital card only allow 1 device?,btohqsg

When u guys like buying a big item purchase like laptop do u guys go sign up 1 new credit card for promotion and buy the item then stop using the card and 1 year later cancel?,btohqsg
i won't..i will find the appropriate credit card that I have that can cater for such purchases.Often  I find maintaining a long relationship with a bank has more benefits than churning apply and cancel.,btohqsg
I am not a big spender normally spend around 1k which is already on UOB one card for UOB one interest already,btohqsg
Plan to get a $0min spend require credit card and benefit it,btohqsg
I applied UOB VS to buy a phone at the shop. Won‚Äôt cancel as I use it for more than $1k but less than $2k purchase at brick & mortar shop,btohqsg
UOB VS is a very underrated card. It should deserve to be in everybody's backup arsenal.. and i believe if you use other UOB cards actively  you should have no issue getting UOB VS annual fee waived similarly too,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have much use for it except above $1k below $2k shop purchase as I use groceries with my lady solitaire  other stuff with PPV or KrisFlyer. Also got CRMC and WWMC to boot. üòÇ,btohqsg
UOB LS min income need $120k to apply -.-,btohqsg

Then slowly work ur way up then. üí™,btohqsg
Still new to credit card world tryigg no to get benefit from that only have a UOB one card for UOB one acc,btohqsg
I also have UOB one. I use it to pay utilities  grab  Macdonald and those UOB$ merchants which affected my other UOB mile cards to get min $500 for Cashback,btohqsg
I just review this videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NviJOmZZvf4&t=370sPlan to open HSBC account and use as GIRO for insurance and tax,btohqsg
Got any lower tier than UOB LS?,btohqsg
You conveniently skipped UOB lady card ü§£,btohqsg
UOB PPV? Since you have the UOB One for UOB One account interest,btohqsg
Easy 4mpd for $1010 max spending,btohqsg
this one is valid right and in this case we just need to set 1st month transfer to HSBC and the 2nd day we transfer out for our daily needs,btohqsg
I set recurring instructions. 1x 2k in to HSBC ega and 5 times of 400 out at the beginning of the month.,btohqsg
Hi@antonio191203Yeah I saw your comment earlierWhen do you start set to HSBC ?,btohqsg
I opened ega around august last year  tgt with my Revo.,btohqsg
I see the HSBC EGA benefit is more on giro only right so I will plan use it for my insurance and tax,btohqsg
Giro is 1 thing. HSBC ega interest for incremental fresh fund is also very good.https://youtu.be/lGvgw03KNxw,btohqsg
You can search the chat and you'll know the consensus of it.,btohqsg
Why 2nd day? Just withdraw after deposit.,btohqsg
oh on the same day is ok as well ?Sorry I am new so not to sure about it,btohqsg
let me do step by step firstI saw you mention open account online however need to go to the branch for e-signature,btohqsg
it seems I used to have hsbc account and unable to login so may need to go onsite,btohqsg
If you can't open online then just go to a branch and open. They will also setup signature when opening the account.,btohqsg
yeah will doThink will go serangoon garden branch which is nearest to my location,btohqsg
For those who buy gift card from wogi  we can‚Äôt see if each voucher has been used  but have to open each voucher  I bought multiple Sheng Shiong $10,btohqsg
Best to save it to ur e-wallets and remove them whenever u used them,btohqsg
If the recurring instructions take place  on a Sat / Sun / PH  will it still fulfil the EGA requirements ? Eg if set on the 1st of each month and 1st Dec is a Sunday,btohqsg
How to save to e wallet? Or what e wallet? Or you mean screenshot?,btohqsg
Both samsung pay and gpay allows u to add gift cards to it but samsung pay's is more flexible where u can input url as the voucher. If u do use samsung pay  save the sheng siong voucher as url and copy and paste the url that directs u to the qr page,btohqsg
Hi can check whether does it matter if i happen to transfer 5x out of ega first then the 1x 2k into ega. Will it be still eligible?,btohqsg
I didnt really check but I don't think it matters üòÅ,btohqsg
Then you better check with shopee ü§£ if you get coins you should get the cashback too,btohqsg

Hello@ChrisHMSG  I would like to know what‚Äôs the best card (be it credit card or non credit card) to use for big ticket overseas spend? About 3k sgd. thank you,btohqsg
Hello. Anyone find using amaze + citi rewards card is not as good compared to uob lady‚Äôs card for overseas spend? I got the worst exchange rate when using amaze card  other uob card was better. Like ppv  uob lady‚Äôs.,btohqsg
Depends when u spend. As weekend there will always be markups.But usually amaze still better using naked,btohqsg
So far only two cards with around 30mins apart   uob ppv seems better 111yen vs amaze+citi 108yen.,btohqsg
ppv not yet include 3.25% fee,btohqsg
Ya pending transaction doenst have 3.25% yet.,btohqsg
Wait for transaction to post then please report back if the rate is indeed better,btohqsg
Thanks this is really good question. I checked again the rate is about the same with uob ppv slightly lower. At the start I only compared amaze transaction and heymax>card section. The pending transaction and heymax showing a different amount. Weird thing is that heymax shows that I only have 120points for a $95 transaction when dining is in the uob ppv mcc. Should have been 190 points instead.,btohqsg
Thanks all for the replies will check in few days üôèüèª,btohqsg
Rate lower but in the statement there may be additional mark up.,btohqsg
Not UOB but once I changed like $1k. The amount of forex I got was very good. But end of month statement amount was more than the $1k due to fees.,btohqsg
Pending amt does not include bank fee,btohqsg

What you mean by no more amaze?,btohqsg
If you use UOB with Amaze  no more rewards. Starting 1st Oct.,btohqsg
Is this for the savings account?,btohqsg
What did u do to trigger auto convert,btohqsg
I am not sure what feature u turned on.If I buy lse stock whether in usd or gbp  after the purchase the gbp will be fully in negative amount.Eg purchase cost gbp4 500. I will see negative gbp4 505 due to commission.Then it is for me to either pay the margin loan. Or to manually convert my surplus cash from another currency into gbp.So obviously I would then convert enough to make it positive gbp1.,btohqsg
But this is not I manually convert  I just deposit sgd to buy usd stock,btohqsg
Anyway IBKR on a regular basis will flatten your currencies that are in small amounts (eg under $1) to 0 by auto convert to your base currency (however yours is usd).So even if u had negative gbp0.27 it will become 0. Of course u will have to pay the interest charged on negative balances until then,btohqsg
Do u have margin facilities activated?,btohqsg
Maybe I should call them tomorrow,btohqsg

Can we start again.How much of each currency did you have at the startWhat did you buy and how much?,btohqsg
I set recurring purchase of Cspx of usd2000  and I transfer in 2650 sgd. the fee is usd 1.86  but instead of converting usd 2000+1.86  they only convert for 2001.81  so this cause my usd -0.05,btohqsg
At start I have a few hundred sgd left from previous purchase,btohqsg
then u have to check your recurring purchase settings. Is auto convert checked?for my IBKR purchaes  there is NEVER any auto conversion of cash into the purchased security's currenccy.Why didn't you convert the SGD into USD before the recurring purchase date?Anyway i believe if you do nothing  they will auto convert SGD1-2 into USD to flatten the negative USD balances within 1 month  but you pay the USD loan interest on the cents until then.,btohqsg
points expiry should be 5 years+3 months. where u see 3 years?,btohqsg
Manual convert will pay sgd 2.94  but auto convert  no fee,btohqsg
The expiry date written behind the card,btohqsg
I meant the card expiry  not sure if thank you points expiry is affected,btohqsg
is it a new card account?,btohqsg
haha... then no choice loh.. u kenna the cents interest (not sure if will be waived)..,btohqsg

If mobile contactless doesn‚Äôt matter. OP might have used the card to paywave,btohqsg
Right I‚Äôm using it contactless  yes pending.,btohqsg
Maybe just wait till the transaction post and see if you get the UNI$ in your banking app. I‚Äôll still trust the uob app > Heymax tracking,btohqsg
What method does heymax app show? I assumed jp terminals sent something different from what heymax expected as contactless. And what mcc did u get for those 2 trnx? (Though unlikely an issue as ppv is blacklist card).,btohqsg

Just search student credit card and compareThere‚Äôs offerings from DBS Maybank CIMB Citibank. Could have missed out from other banks.,btohqsg
Tertiary credit card does not need income. Usually credit limit is $500 with some banks offer lesser rewards.,btohqsg
Yes  some even as low as 0.3% equivalent. Lol,btohqsg
Citi clear card for student n DBS Live fresh for student.,btohqsg
Maybank eVibes and CIMB AWSM also,btohqsg
GXS alsoI think revolut may have had something a while back but not sure if they‚Äôre still running the program,btohqsg
Lol reward almost equal to none,btohqsg
Can always get secured cc if the student have >10k equivalent to place in FD,btohqsg
what‚Äôs the main difference between them,btohqsg
We have shared some info here with you. The rest of info you can google n start your research.,btohqsg
Also for these credit card for tertiary students  if you missed payments  it will affect your credit card report which will affect if you what to apply bank loans and other credit cards in the future.

Will be counted Next month if missed this month.,btohqsg
Yeah i also think so  now kinda regretted not using vantage card hahaha,btohqsg
Oh why? Are you expecting to burst UOB lady cap in Oct?,btohqsg
Anyone know how to get miles/cash back for interior design fees? My id only accepts bank transfer/paynow,btohqsg
Planned a pretty last minute trip in December and from what i understand is DBS cards used transaction date to quantity for the bouns points  i thought i was slick in using the UOB lady card as well hahahah,btohqsg
I mean getting a 1.5mpd is still better than 0.4mpd on UOB lady :(,btohqsg
You still earn 4mpd with UOB for Oct what. Unless u expect to exceed UOB lady cap.,btohqsg
Oh because i am also planning to do some more bookings in October as well hahaha,btohqsg
I only managed to settle my flight but hotel accommodations isnt ready yet so i think bursting the 1k cap is pretty easy if the posting date is in October rather than September,btohqsg
I have 50k worth of renovation to pay. Can I explore using cardup + uob krisflyer?,btohqsg
Cardup yes but why uob KF?,btohqsg
Well you have time for dbs wwmc and dbs altitude (Oct promo). üòÅ,btohqsg
Oh both maxed le hahaha the total flights is around 5k for 5pax  which I've used different cards to maximise the miles game,btohqsg
Maxed for Oct? You are telling me your hotel booking will be more than 1.5k and 2k?,btohqsg
Yeah hotel i predicted it'll cost me around 4.5k total because im flying for 12 days and minimum need 2 rooms  if per night its 200 bucks it'll be $200 x 2 rooms x 11 nights,btohqsg
Coz no cap. What card would u recommend ?,btohqsg
You can split hotel bookings to prepayment and pay at hotel. Then you will have 3.5k in Oct and 2k in December to play with. Throw in UOB VS for 2k spend in Dec for a good measure.,btohqsg
"Wait this is new to me  what do u mean by doing the ""prepayment and pay at hotel"" ?",btohqsg
Assuming if i were to charge 2k for hotel booking  do i spilt the charge after the posting is done in my card or do i opt in to pay at hotel?,btohqsg
Some hotels/travel site will charge you right away when you book. Alternatively  some will also allow you to pay when you are there.,btohqsg
Or are you staying 11 days in 1 hotel? üòÖ,btohqsg
I'm making a few assumptions about your trip  such as you will have more than 2 hotels to book.,btohqsg
If u have access to that  yes. 1.5mpd is way better than 1.2mpd.,btohqsg
Yeah we've planned for a total of 4 different hotels to stay at  but i think we prolly be using agoda orbooking.com,btohqsg
"Ya Agoda orbooking.comyou can filter by ""Pay Now"" or ""Pay At Hotel"".",btohqsg
If u can get dbs vantage  maybe it's time to upgrade to uob lady sol too. üòÅ,btohqsg
Oh nice okay  i also realised that DBS Altitude is running a promotion where you'll get 5mpd for overseas spending in decemeber  do u still get 5mpd if i were to pay at the hotel in sgd or must it be via their currency (yen) for it to quantity for the promotion ah,btohqsg
"Yeah i was thinking of upgrading also hahahah but because previously i dont see a need for it  but now i think its always better to upgrade for the ""just in case"" scenario hahahah",btohqsg
There are 2 periods for dbs Altitude 5mpd.Oct online booking (via Agoda booking.com) or flight tix will get 5mpd. This can be any currency. Min 1k  max 2k.Nov - Dec: need to be foreign currency charged to the card. Min 1k  max 2k.,btohqsg
Oh needs to be foreign currency for December promotion hmmm  cuz i am thinking whether is it worth it to pay the fees/poor fx conversion for those miles or is it better to just use a card like youtrip/trustbank,btohqsg
3.25% for 5mpd is worth it for my own value of miles. You gotta do your own calc and see if it's worth for you. Alternatively  you can get another human to apply for 2nd dbs Altitude to maximize Oct 5mpd promo.,btohqsg
Ah okay  lucky still got some time for me to do some calculations for my miles accumulation journey  thanks for ur help Anthony!! Really appreciate ur advice!!,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check and have some opinions if this promo is worth? The maintenance period I think is 3 months  how to calculate if it‚Äôs better to get 25k miles vs investing the 100k in money market fund. Thank you üôè,btohqsg

Hi gurus  is the HSBC live card based on transaction date or posted dates,btohqsg
Last month was like 96 640 and now was 96 1xx,btohqsg
Still no news of uob savings promo ?,btohqsg
You need to top-up about $31200 to hit MAB increment of $500.,btohqsg
Sorry now is 97 1xx. My bad,btohqsg
Avg is 450plus now or so. I just log off so can't remember haha,btohqsg
best is sum up end balance everyday 1st Sep to 30 Sep and divided by 30,btohqsg
So it's barely $97100. You need to top-up about $1500. $1800 if you want to play safe.,btohqsg
Yup I think probably I added today's figure and was wondering why there is a gap. The figure above should be till 29 Sep then,btohqsg
If you want to top-up  better top-up soon. Before 10pm to be safe.,btohqsg
For HSBC EGA transfer out today what is cut off time any DP can share?,btohqsg

Morning everyone  saw the video on uob one vs ocbs 360 for highest interest rate. I have some questions  hope you'll can help me clarify it.1) The ocbc sending bouns interest. Must it be credit card or can I use the debit card to send the $500?2) Min incremental saving is it yearly or monthly ? And if I fail the $500 saving how much interest will I lose ?The video was uploaded 2 mths ago. Currently which bank gives the best saving interest if i meet the salary credit of $2k  Min spend of $500  incremental saving and a fund of 100k ?I appreciate the help and advice. I am new to this  still learning and trying to understand the saving interest rates,btohqsg
1. Only cc I think2. MonthlyYou should explore ocbc 360 page for detailed info.https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/deposits/360-savings-accountAs of oct 24  ocbc 360 and UOB one interests are still the same as the video you watched. For ur use case  I think ocbc 360 will be better.,btohqsg
Hi  No One Answer of the two questions as below:1). Info can be found on OCBC 360 website.2). Info can be found on OCBC 360 website.https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/deposits/360-savings-account,btohqsg
For all the cc that states min spend  those on exclusion list included in the min spend? E.g. paying for insurance not eligible for cashback but is it counted towards min spend?,btohqsg
Hi  May I check  if I‚Äôm charging my Shopee purchase of 1200  to $200/mth installment via ocbc 365 credit card  will I be eligible to clock for monthly $200 for my 365 credit card for 6 month? (I need to clock $800/mth to get the cashback)Or will I be directly clocked for $1200 for Oct?,btohqsg
Installment usually not counted to spending and no reward,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not too sure also. Maybe I‚Äôll call the bank later to check.,btohqsg
U see card tnc that is what cso refer to as well,btohqsg
Hi all  side question regarding UOB ONE Credit Card  do offline card payments at dental clinics and dermatology clinics qualify for the cc min spend?,btohqsg
should be eligible unless mcc is one of those excluded,btohqsg
Both 0  Shopee's installment plan is using bank's IPP.,btohqsg
Thanks all for the info. üôè,btohqsg
Ok  just checked. it's eligible. UOB ONE Credit Card excludes hospital payments 8062  but dental and ortho  is 8021 and it's not in the exclusion list.,btohqsg
Trying to understand UOB earmark promo. Does it always use sep MAB?Or can i clear my uob one account now and participate in Nov?,btohqsg
Their tnc gave me the impression of sep MAB.,btohqsg
cannot... UOB plunging chicken uses FIXED months' ADB based on our observations.March ADBJune ADBSep ADBDec ADBso no matter which month u earmark  it always refers to one of those ADB.which also means since now the earmark is 5 months.. if you do Plunging Chicken now  you have to sit out the next 2 cycles.,btohqsg
Hi all  for UOB ONE account insurance payment it must be made on a recurring basis to qualify for the 4% interest?,btohqsg
You are asking insurance or hospital or dental ?,btohqsg
and it is for the 1st month only  is that right?,btohqsg
Miss the good ol days just need to clear last day of month then can spam,btohqsg
UOB One account got no insurance criteria. Just salary and spend.,btohqsg
too many gamers like us... UOB cannot tahan...,btohqsg
Yes i mean if i want to spend the $500 just on insurance but on a non-recurring basis. Do i still qualify for 4%?,btohqsg
Got it. Wait for Dec to clear then.,btohqsg
if you want to take part next round Plunging Chicken (January sign up)..you need to make sure your December UOB One account is $1 001 ADB.,btohqsg
and that's even assuming they will still run another Plunging Chicken if Fed cut another 0.5%...maybe from $1100 to $700 to $300.. u still want?and maybe no more 4% UOB One already,btohqsg
it is not bad actually  can just mean trf the $$$ out after 1st month end. ooppss,btohqsg
This is a risk for sure. Gotta keep monitoring and decide when Jan comes. Dec I need to shuffle my bank account balance anyway for all these cpf  srs things.,btohqsg
That's what people are doing. Nothing new,btohqsg
i didnt know  i usually put for 2 months. and the interest rate dont come in immediately for hsbc.,btohqsg
Does anyone have any knowledge on this?I have a trip to Japan coming Dec and since UOB exclude Amaze. Shopping with UOB KF is no longer viable.,btohqsg
How does changipay help u in any way?,btohqsg
Hihi for ocbc360  if i transfer out all $ today to another bank  will still get the bonus interest for Sep right?,btohqsg
Turns offline to online like amaze? UOB KF only reward miles on online shopping?And Changi Pay is on the Alipay network  which I can use in Japan ?,btohqsg
why u make it sound like a hack when it is very normal,btohqsg
Which merchants in Japan accept alipay pairing with non china payment method?,btohqsg
go with Maybank Mastercard 3.2mpd uncapped for big overseas shopping.,btohqsg
hahaha... i think now many people familar already,btohqsg
Not interested in having another card that I am not going to use often and have like orphan miles.,btohqsg
maybank world mastercard has:1. NO EXPIRY2. FREE TRANSFERyou sure u don't wanna have a look?,btohqsg
Lemme make it simple. It doesn't work.,btohqsg
They are rolling out for sure,btohqsg
i'm more curious if i say use ChangiPay or Ezlink... what is the FX spread charged,btohqsg
Only ChangiPay is linked to CC. Ezlink and TNG have to make payment with e-wallet which one have to top-up.,btohqsg
i think a big danger (even if accepted in Japan) is what is the MCC used.Japan many weird MCC and UOB KF CC is a very small white list of MCCs accepted,btohqsg
Yes sir  go Japan better use blacklist card in general,btohqsg
Last time I ate at somewhere near their train station using my lady's and it was coded as some public transport mcc,btohqsg
Will be only using UOB KF for shopping on branded goods  should be no issue for me.,btohqsg
I think all of us are trying our best with our own bias/knowledge to answer ur questions. Changipay seems to be new option in JP. I  mdm Mt and others lurking in JP group chat and aint aware of this.Your argumentative questions are not helpful to the discussion.,btohqsg
But dont worry Mt is reaching out to her network in JP,btohqsg
the short story is:1. someone has tested touch and go and OCBC Pay in Japan. It works  but not 100% reliable2. watch out for the actual FX rate3. MCC unknown since both tested are not credit card link4. using the above logic  your proposed changipay SHOULD work  but beware #2 and #3.,btohqsg
"But for you to question me ""how does ChangiPay help"" helps the discussion?For you to tell me that ""it doesn't work"" helps the discussion?And now going back on your words say that ""it doesnt work"" now you say you weren't aware of this payment method and is now looking into it.",btohqsg
As stated  i answered with my best knowledge at that point. You could simply answer Changipay is accepted in JP like mdm Mt shared the article. That piece of info is new to me.,btohqsg
You said it doesn't work  so I ask how do you know. You couldn't even give me an answer.,btohqsg
And you have the nerve to tell me that I'm being unhelpful.,btohqsg
One thing we need to be thankful is we have many helpful people who willing to share their knowledge. What we can do  is read as much learn as much  if we still don‚Äôt understand  we ask them. That is how we can all progress. Don‚Äôt expect people to spoonfeed to you. We tell this to our children so we should expect the same for ourselves.,btohqsg

Can't believe that my information is still with HSBC after cancellation of the cc more than 14 months ago,btohqsg
What happened? Bank is supposed to keep ur information thou. Up to 5 or 7 years like that.,btohqsg
I still can't apply for HSBC ega online,btohqsg

Anyone can advise when collect item from Short Q at orchardSeems always crazy queue there,btohqsg

I called hsbc two months back and they told me to wait till first week of Sep and now is already October.,btohqsg
Yes. Can set recurring transfers or manual transfers. Both work.,btohqsg
Did HSBC EGA changed the way they state the interest? It used to be up to 4.50% or thereabout.. and it includes the 1% for everyday rewards..Now it's only 3.25%? So it doesn't include the 1% now right..,btohqsg
Dont wait  just go branch do  expect long queue,btohqsg
it is good this way.. more accurate..later some only do the 3.x% part but never do the other.. never get 4.x% then complain,btohqsg

EGA gurus  for Sep/OctEGA bonus interest promo already registered using ref mth Aug 2k balance & also did the 2k in + 5 tx out for Aug  Sep  Oct   is it :Sep incremental ADB (80k) is it at 3.x% + 1% = = 4.x%(End Sep bal = 100k)Oct incremental ADB (20k) is it at 3.x % ? Or 3.x% + 1% = 4.x% ?(End Oct bal = 120k)1) So is it the interest for the existing 100k from Sep at 3.x% ?2) CSO said the above qualifies for 2 rounds of that bonus $300 (1st one in mid Oct  2nd one in mid Nov). Is that true?,btohqsg
Sep 80k 4.x%Oct 100k 3.x% 20k 1%1) See above2) what 300 bonus? 1% rebate capped at 300 per month?,btohqsg
1) 20k gets 1% as in $16+ interest?2) Yes  that's what she said.,btohqsg
So 2) yes means what CSO said is correct ?,btohqsg
ya  of cos. what else could it have been?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a half truth. Only the incremental $20k got the 1% bonus in the second month.,btohqsg
It seems OCBC 360 more worth,btohqsg
yea but need to meet salary  save and spend,btohqsg
I tried to consider the OCBC 360 but I find it hard to find a credit card to spend for it. What are people using and if possible  what is the key feature that works for you?,btohqsg
ocbc rewards card buy vouchers from heymax to get 6mpd+ Max miles,btohqsg
Cardup with ocbc 90N pay income tax ?,btohqsg
This one sounds interesting. I go explore üòä,btohqsg
If not enough can bill to utilities also but won‚Äôt get points only cash,btohqsg
using ocbc 365? need to meet min spend,btohqsg
I was referring to him for 90N but 365 card also works,btohqsg
I read the website like no limit on spend for 1.3mpd right for 90N,btohqsg
Op wording seems to suggest asking about 1% incremental bonus interest.That one also capped at $300.,btohqsg
Yes uncapped. Ocbc 90n has special promo code with cardup too. Can use for non income tax payment.,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
If have capped die liao this card,btohqsg
he already clarified it is about 1% rebate capped at 300 monthly,btohqsg
If one visit Fairprice often can use reward card buy heymax Fairprice 6mpd not bad,btohqsg
but only can use for fairprice delivery,btohqsg
So can only get the $300 once   in second month (Oct) - credit in mid Nov?,btohqsg
What $300 exactly are u referring to?,btohqsg
The Fairprice $3.99 service fee annoys me a lot. It is on top of delivery charges if any and cannot be waived.,btohqsg
Oh sorry I didn‚Äôt notice the charge,btohqsg
Get the digital member ... If u buy a lot,btohqsg
Personally I use rewards card the 6mpd for other vouchers and utilities are not bad.,btohqsg
No sorry bro! I used to just pay without noticing also until my wife spotted it in one purchase and ask me,btohqsg
Tung Lok for occasional meal 6mpd,btohqsg

Don‚Äôt delay. The earlier u do the more hay u make.The sun is setting.,btohqsg
They do open on sat half day,btohqsg
CSO used 1% of 30k (increase) for both mths  can't remember exactly what terminology she said.,btohqsg
Is it worth starting this Saturday or should I do so say next month instead?,btohqsg
Yes. That would be the 1% incremental month on month balance bonus interest. It is capped at $300 per month which implies max of $360k incremental month on month balance,btohqsg
