I've been hearing that NTU standards are slowly dropping though,btohqsg
i study CAAS until want hong gan,btohqsg
he said the prof suck cok,btohqsg

either truth table and the another one,btohqsg
only bar i know is prison bar bro,btohqsg
EVEN I FORGOT WHAT COURSE I GOT FOR NUS,btohqsg

almost everyone in ntu dont care about ntusu lol,btohqsg
and the guy paotoh exam paper to his prof,btohqsg
why am i going aerospace when i have interest in,btohqsg
ntu aerospace is swerved to mechanics ah,btohqsg

i did that also  ngl fun module,btohqsg
jus go in talk cock w lecturer and done,btohqsg
i need to memo 200 slides,btohqsg
air law if i rmb correctly the exams is they open one eye one,btohqsg
coz they know abit harsh to rmb 200+ slides,btohqsg
so rmb a certain part of the certain slides and u can score,btohqsg
or maybe is yall suay coz after covid they need to check their lecture,btohqsg
when u never apply earlier sia. u take how many national exams in sg alr,btohqsg
before covid alot things can open one eyes one,btohqsg
i missed all my bursaries cuz of me being pr back in the days,btohqsg
i heard now no more mass lecture also,btohqsg
haha in aviation industry if open one eye,btohqsg
all go use com listen come sch do tutorial,btohqsg
the plane also open one eye to fly,btohqsg
that one close eye also can fly,btohqsg
u dont let the passengers know can liao,btohqsg
at most the second officer not there,btohqsg
i rmb year 3 got one module is go lab and play with microsoft air simulator,btohqsg
wah fk i doing it now,btohqsg
i need use flight data recorder,btohqsg
ik of a friend  he is born here but his parents never let him become citizen first cause they dk whether they will go back to india. but eventually they stayed here long term so my friend became citizen at like 13,btohqsg
wa toh den yall had it hard,btohqsg
then i need use fking matlab,btohqsg
and arduino in the later weeks,btohqsg
i rmb that module quite easy coz is with fyp one,btohqsg
is that too much to ask?,btohqsg
u go fyp and internship can get higher i think,btohqsg
i got my a during fyp,btohqsg
ntu aero 10 percentile is what now,btohqsg
i went internship i got A also,btohqsg
fr ntu mech is some next lvl,btohqsg
they got module teach u draw engineering drawing,btohqsg
actually u r very safe mah. ntu aero 10 percentile is 3.55,btohqsg
i quite traumatised learning VOR RADAR ILS DME,btohqsg
and there are more to come spanking my ass every week,btohqsg
oh so u wan change ah. but change to what,btohqsg
jus to let u know u can go aerospace industry with a mechanical engineering cert,btohqsg
don't like suka suka think aiya easy la sial,btohqsg
i tell you those ponsters and yp in aerospace,btohqsg
they barely getting 2 for their gpa,btohqsg
like reduce wastage and cost one,btohqsg
quite interesting if u like stats ah,btohqsg
i got learn chi square also,btohqsg
i am doing it this sem,btohqsg
wa after ns ah i legit cannot rmb what i learn in poly,btohqsg
like i only rmb i took the modules before,btohqsg
but idk what i learn from it,btohqsg
i will go through what you have went through before,btohqsg
after my o level i thought i will remember my pure chem stuff for like the next 5 months,btohqsg
i think i got take one module for the systems in the aircraft,btohqsg
teach u which systems do what,btohqsg
i applied part time for 3 months  content in my head gone in 1 month,btohqsg
but the thing is u need to have the ability to relearn,btohqsg
like i need to learn the types of engine,btohqsg
the only pop and bang ik is jdm cars,btohqsg
u can forget now but 6 months down the road i give u the slides u can tell me oh this is blah blah,btohqsg
hopefully all of u can survive well in uni. when u all come to ntu  poly direct y2 may sounds good but squeezing everything into 3 years  your workload every sem will be pretty high. quite a lot of seniors voluntarily or involuntarily extend to 3.5 years,btohqsg
even my lecturers that went 3E y2 direct,btohqsg
my friend in ntu kena 3 sat exam back to back,btohqsg
1 year off your life expectancy or uni or both,btohqsg
your choice lor sleep social life study 3 choose 2,btohqsg
i just drop out and sign on,btohqsg
ya and eating sleeping pills give u sleep instantly,btohqsg
at most i go st engineering,btohqsg
u go here might as well sign on ngl,btohqsg
i know a 28 yo supervisor in st eng aerospace systems  he grad from 3E ntu y2 direct,btohqsg
depends la hor since got aero degree le why not aim big,btohqsg
at most i live till 50 ah,btohqsg
i think now the in thing is use CAE,btohqsg
like u draw the drawing in CAD den u use it to analysis your part to check for any defects all that,btohqsg
plus point if uk how to do it,btohqsg
if u go mech Eng also need eh,btohqsg
tmr is QSAN for u or lab,btohqsg
bro radar lab is fking hard,btohqsg
u do the anss online already?,btohqsg
when u want to do aeis ws05 ah,btohqsg
dog say u do week then never fo,btohqsg
i still haven touch avionics interface,btohqsg
that one got fuck ton of op amp,btohqsg
vyeoz uw we dropout and sign on?,btohqsg
what’s ur highest gpa now tho,btohqsg
they give me scholarship then i sign on,btohqsg

u can search on tik tok… that sg stay at home daughter,btohqsg
I mean from what I've heard  JC bio and uni bio is diff,btohqsg
But my friend who's taking bcmh rn  his bio tutor say uni and JC bio is kinda similar overall💀,btohqsg
"You'll prob have more of an ""advantage"" if ur really set on becoming a doctor",btohqsg
supposedly it doesnt matter whether u take B or P,btohqsg
Alsooo sec bio and JC bio is so diff LOL  sec bio is just like the stepping stone for wtvs to come and causeee back then I took trip sci in sec sch  and now  I looked abit at H2 bio notes wah  the lecture book is THICC AF and because there's so much content in greater depth  you'll have to really  prioritise understanding and grasp it really well rather than smoking it thruI take pcme now cos my pc btr than my b,btohqsg
"If I'm not mistaken  if you were to do that  there's some bridging you'll have to do urself somehow in order to catch up with what you missed out on cause not every cher would even briefly go thru what was taught back then cause it's supposedly "" assumed knowledge"" at that point",btohqsg
So you'll have to juggle btw bridging and JC lessons yep,btohqsg
uk its lowkey q vibes to stay up until u hear the first train,btohqsg
not sure why these days I’ve been waking up earlier than 7am,btohqsg
oh   did u have any caffeine boost?,btohqsg
no ive just been lying in bed for the past 3 hours,btohqsg
im waking up now cuz im going to expo later for fintech fest,btohqsg
is it only day 1 sch bring you,btohqsg
proof you literally become lifeless after ord,btohqsg
bold of you to assume i have a life even before poly,btohqsg
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL but guess what  u actl made it 💀💀💀,btohqsg
why wld the sch bring us   is not a sec sch learning journey ah,btohqsg
Some ppl feel no kick some legit dying,btohqsg
nah he wants to kill himself,btohqsg
Profile helps but grades comes first,btohqsg
actually is that still true now given the changes with how nus is accepting people,btohqsg
rp isnt rly king anymore is it,btohqsg
none of it matters without grades,btohqsg
For O lvl fresh grads going JC  do not ever underestimate JC syllabus.,btohqsg
Depends ah  if you're only a 60+ pointer aiming for law  your profile won't really help ah,btohqsg
The lowest I heard was 78+,btohqsg
Yeah  it ain't everything anymore but it's still very important  don't neglect it  kiddos,btohqsg
tele hitch = lowballer ‘s ride,btohqsg
its at least 20k for a 20 motif,btohqsg
How do you even use it?,btohqsg
how do u even get tele hitch,btohqsg
is it like a channel or smth,btohqsg
by right u can only do 2 rides a day as a non-phv driver,btohqsg
i step out of house im drenched,btohqsg
depends on whether ppl do drive that route,btohqsg
it ‘s a detour for those working in cbd,btohqsg
those are hitch platforms that are not “illegal”,btohqsg
no offense but asking for cheap rides is a sense of entitlement rather than a need,btohqsg
I unds that ur sweating & all but what abt others who have no such choices?,btohqsg
but lesser ppl are doing it now,btohqsg
its not like im asking for a personal chauffeur or anything,btohqsg
but if u rly want such a service   pls use GrabHitch or Ryde,btohqsg
u have better chances than the so called tele hitch,btohqsg
if accident good luck - no grab insurance policy,btohqsg
u get what u pay for,btohqsg
doesn't cover illegal activities yo :),btohqsg
if u get accident when drinking  u won't be covered too,btohqsg
drink while driving is literal suicide,btohqsg
Are there any telehitch grps one can join?,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  snatchjobs has one,btohqsg
I lost my wallet and some ppl contacted returned it to the station,btohqsg
Jewel snowhouse is boring but freezing at -13 degrees,btohqsg
Nope I tried pulling but didn't manage to 😭  that was the whole reason I started playing genshin,btohqsg
Idk when he's coming back 😔,btohqsg
Ngl mona is soooo tricky to use,btohqsg
Hold up   why is it so shit,btohqsg
did u join alumini club in gdlss,btohqsg
They used to need inv ppl den can use their services sia,btohqsg
Oof   mona is my very first 5 star like a few days ago  I'm ar34... Should I build her,btohqsg
I think they removed it coz cfm cannot hit one,btohqsg
neuvillete will come home one day,btohqsg

i don't live at sbw but WHYY 😭 😭 😭,btohqsg
nahhh that goofy ahh charged shot 💀 💀 💀,btohqsg
u see the outside of the cylinder but not the inside 💀,btohqsg
bluds still play genshin in 2023 🗿,btohqsg
as long as yall dont spend all of ur life savings on pixelated girls and end up becoming beggars on the streets its fine,btohqsg
nah nah some of them look young but are like 1000+ years old,btohqsg
thats the same as saying i like ladyboys but im actually straight,btohqsg
into touching guys like kazuha now?,btohqsg
man's crowned his glorious kazuha as his pfp,btohqsg
i mean i used to play,btohqsg
i quit like 2 years ago,btohqsg
u need to go for this,btohqsg
smell the fresh air surrounding u,btohqsg
listen to the birds chirp as they fly around,btohqsg
in other words get off ur pc,btohqsg
im both off my pc and touching grass,btohqsg
does that work in sg tho,btohqsg
how do u feel the grass without feeling the antshow do u smell the air without smelling the hazehow do u hear the birds without hearing the cars,btohqsg
literally just go to ur void deck got so much grass,btohqsg
there is nothing we can do,btohqsg
Kazuha is anemo okie idk who's the other two brb,btohqsg
My fav water jet 3000 🥰,btohqsg
if u from ITE west this might look familiar,btohqsg
Artificial grass  buy those packaged   air in a can and the last idk,btohqsg
What if I get diluc before I get bennett,btohqsg
holy fuck bro doesnt need to touch grass grass needs to touch bro,btohqsg
WOAH U CAN SEE FROM HERE,btohqsg
Think abt it  it's actually possible,btohqsg
so u not gna roast a paedophile,btohqsg
wheres the platform low glass wall,btohqsg
u mean platform screen doors ah,btohqsg
u got nvr see MRT without the PSD ah,btohqsg
i dont think i even took the mrt by p3....,btohqsg
like parents bringing small kids onto mrt,btohqsg
bruh car was so cheap then,btohqsg
depends on the type of car u buy,btohqsg
we were talking abt back in 2000s,btohqsg
ik. just saying now 50-80k dont even talk about buying car  coe also cannot...,btohqsg
now the meta is get license then go hdb downstairs rent ur carshare lol,btohqsg
but getgo lately been drawing a bit of flake,btohqsg
or is it just some of the car renters drive like cock lol,btohqsg
i see ppl HAVENT EVEN drive out of FUCKING LOT MOUNT KERB ALR LOL BODOH,btohqsg
my coursemate who rent getgo frequently have issues unlocking their vehicles,btohqsg
is it. dk abt getgo. never rent from them bef,btohqsg
half the time their aircon not working,btohqsg
that is assuming the fare didn’t surge like mad,btohqsg
tbh u dont really need to drive in sg except under certain circumstances (e.g. occasionally u have a lot of things to carry around  overnight no public transport  u have family  etc.),btohqsg
but then sg v hot then like if u need go formal event,btohqsg
depends lor. sometimes ride-hailing also not very reliable and convenient. if u have a lot of things to carry and u need to make multiple trips to carry stuff from the car  u also cannot ask the grab driver wait for u. and sometimes really late at night no drivers want to pick u also,btohqsg
CB I YOUNGER THAN HIM I STILL KNEW THERE WEREN'T PSDS 💀,btohqsg
i took when i was like,btohqsg
i rmb i took a video like,btohqsg
bro my parents always pester me to take car,btohqsg
but i prefer to take mrt,btohqsg
mrt gonna die in 3 years alr so that's why i dowan car,btohqsg
Depends lor. If you drive during peak hours plus erp is on…,btohqsg
i actually prefer early morning trains,btohqsg
And cbd parking is not cheap btw,btohqsg
used to ride mrt from 6am,btohqsg
i always stand in mrt lol,btohqsg
that's why don't buy lor haha,btohqsg
can wake up at least 30 mins later,btohqsg
my siao on mate be like :ｕ come ns to sleep or to serve,btohqsg
altho rental cars also another issue la haiz. all the inexperienced ppl driving. then u always see them end up on mothership or reddit cuz of some stupid accident. or ppl who abuse the rental cars because they can lol,btohqsg
if u get into an accident while driving a rental car  the rental companies are not gonna be nice to you with regard to the insurance excess btw. then some ppl go on reddit kaopeh why need pay 6k to rental company for small accident lol,btohqsg
the busines plan is always good on paper but there will be assholes ruining it,btohqsg
either that or greed takes over,btohqsg
i think he's referring to some of the train models being retired lol,btohqsg
if really entire mrt dying i cant wait to see the coe shoot up to 1m,btohqsg
the first 3 generation of MRTs gonna get scrapped,btohqsg
so far no concrete information any of them will be preserved,btohqsg
I finally get the NSF clubbing phase,btohqsg
are you at the phase spending-entire-month-allowance-in-1-night ?,btohqsg
Nah but I get why they club lol,btohqsg
u have a friend that is lgbt,btohqsg
wld u try convince them otherwise,btohqsg
but what if they do this,btohqsg
dont u think lgbt is abit of a nuisance sometimes,btohqsg
i feel like id get cancellled but like,btohqsg
why do people like to boast abt it,btohqsg
and why do they try to influence others to be like them,btohqsg
like its advanced beyond getting accepted atp,btohqsg
True chad lgbts are the one that keep very low key about it... its not that they are embarrassed by their orientation or anything but they don't want no drama,btohqsg
but the sad truth is most arent,btohqsg
and thats why alot of ppl get a bad impression of them,btohqsg
yeah but its getting kinda out of hand tho,btohqsg
its mostly in the west tho,btohqsg
im gonna be brutally honest but i find lgbt kind of a joke,btohqsg
no hate to u if ur lgbt urself but,btohqsg
that ur going against how humans r biologically designed,btohqsg
ofc not thats why i find it quite hilarious,btohqsg
im sorry idw get cancelled for what i just said but,btohqsg
personal feelings no hate to anyone,btohqsg
ok maybe this is getting abit biased im gonna be less acoustic,btohqsg
never seen one irl in fact,btohqsg
best prevention ofc is no segs,btohqsg
nat is bringing up valid points though,btohqsg
then that is how you should respond. develop the argument  not shut it down,btohqsg
thats bc u cant handle ur liquor,btohqsg
Convince them otherwise? Damn  never knew that's possible,btohqsg
i rmb putting fake blood all over my face,btohqsg
the rest of the night was js horrendous 💀💀,btohqsg
as someone who doesnt do seggs  uh no condoms do provide a sense of security for those who do want to explore their seggsual side in a much more safer manner than just going in raw. yes  i wouldnt want to have seggs but there are many who may want that but be safe in it. can it still have issues? maybe and that's why i prefer not to  because im not prepared in that low chance  but does it mean its just aids prevention  no,btohqsg
give me a tldr if udm,btohqsg
i would break down nats arguments but i cba,btohqsg
Being gay goes against nature = it is fundamentally flawed,btohqsg
Actually wait he deadass skipped stage 2,btohqsg
"people literally used to try and ""correct"" left handedness",btohqsg
And went from goes against nature = they are a nuisance,btohqsg
who the fuck cares about biological design,btohqsg
well  how about let's try a different argument,btohqsg
should a country (like singapore) try whatever it can to ensure its existence?,btohqsg
if people were so concerned of this the industrial revolution would never happen,btohqsg
So should a country try to remove lgbt people?,btohqsg
Idk I'm trying to understand the qn they asked,btohqsg
The whether it can ensure its existence,btohqsg
yeah let's say we say that national interest takes priority. we need to ensure that 100 years  200 years from now  sg still exists,btohqsg
how far are we willing to do to do this?,btohqsg
But what do lgbt people have to do with national interest,btohqsg
should we even take steps if it seems against personal bodily autonomy and personal choice?,btohqsg
we have a critically low birth rate. does this mean we should not encourage (or discourage  or forbid) condoms  abortion  non-traditional marriage and relationships?,btohqsg
if you think queer people are against personal bodily autonomy and personal choice you need to work on your own perception of queer people,btohqsg
If u r gg the population route  the fundamental issue with that is that gay people are the minority  even if u make all of them have kids that won't change anything,btohqsg
or should we way  personal choice comes first  even if it means no more sg down the road,btohqsg
And the other thing is there's still stuff like ivf which can be ways as to how we can have more ways to increase the population,btohqsg
Being gay does not necessarily mean u cannot have kids  it's how surrogacy works,btohqsg
Actually that may not be true,btohqsg
Preventive checks by Thomas malthus go brr,btohqsg
discouraging contraception/abortion is infringing on women's health and human rights already,btohqsg
Not sure if surrogacy is the right word in this context,btohqsg
did u not see roe v wade,btohqsg
where should the line be drawn?,btohqsg
What she's trying to ask is if the practical reasons for infringing human rights do they outweigh the moral reasons,btohqsg
Which is a very valid tension,btohqsg
why is the discussion revived LOL,btohqsg
should we force more kids on the population  to ensure the country's continued existence?,btohqsg
a light saturday morning chat :),btohqsg
There's a reason why u can argue that we need less gay people to support the populationThat being said  is that a desirable outcome or is that necessarily the best way to support the population?,btohqsg
every chat is heavy in the morning cos i cannot think,btohqsg
Or whenever I need to teach :/,btohqsg
