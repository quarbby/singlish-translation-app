For JC arts stream  can students do H2 Math as their contrasting subject  and a H1 humanities subject? üßê,btohqsg
Idk from chpt 1 to 10,btohqsg
As long as you have a contrasting subject  it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs H1 or 2,btohqsg
Although it is still up to the JC if it wants to offer you the combination,btohqsg
Half of my class did that,btohqsg
They took H2 math + H1 History,btohqsg
if I'm not wrong qn 3 was 'the older and younger generation cannot understand each other due to the generation gap' do you agree?,btohqsg
goexams.sghave a lot of notes there,btohqsg
H2 math is actl a requirement for so many courses in local unis lol,btohqsg
Majority of the art ppl in my jc took h2 math,btohqsg
That's what I got too. It's an absolute so cannot so yes rite,btohqsg
Dont think arts students want to do engineering/sci in uni also,btohqsg
Tbh most of my arts friends in jc had no idea what they wanna do in uni,btohqsg
Idk I thot cannot is an absolute,btohqsg
planning to take up a degree in social science dont know which one yet  need h2 math meh?,btohqsg
Will be helpful if u wanna major in econs,btohqsg
so say i wanna take history/geography h2 econs his geog but h1 math can right,btohqsg
Yep econs in uni is hardcore math,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think social sciences has any subject prerequisite,btohqsg
Hardly anyone takes Hist and Geog together though  I believe,btohqsg
A mainstream arts combination is more like HELm and GELm  cause Hist and Geog r v content heavy,btohqsg
Hist Geo is already a deadly combi in sec school I feel,btohqsg

No I am not shading anyone,btohqsg
With some toppings of pure sci,btohqsg

Better take good care. Risk of joint rheumatoid,btohqsg
