Aiyo don't overwhelm Urself yet  there's enough time for that,btohqsg
As in beat u up or beat you,btohqsg
im alr doing h2 physics and chem now ðŸ˜µ,btohqsg
oh cool I was in Sec 4NA this year,btohqsg
idk man PSLE is too dependent on the rate that diff kids develop,btohqsg
Ngl I feel like upper sec shld start teaching much more As stuff,btohqsg

Which they are I think for new syllabus,btohqsg
Ya  but most of em prob wont come back,btohqsg
I otw to becoming  reclusive all the way,btohqsg
Very fundamental like no pt teaching,btohqsg
i think if they introduce J1 stuff in sec 4 then ppl will actually die,btohqsg
I get too agitated easily interacting with ppl,btohqsg
o level nuclear is like â€¦,btohqsg
Me toooo  my dad say no money cannot go overseas HAHAHA,btohqsg
tbh even a level physics that touches on non classical stuff,btohqsg
remember that 99.9% of gamblers quit before they win big,btohqsg
actually jc stuff quite okay it's just cuz I nvr study at all in j1,btohqsg
So I struggled like mad in j2,btohqsg
A level physics is too basic for A level,btohqsg
my gripe with a level physics is,btohqsg
Cuz its mostly just o level physics part 2,btohqsg
I feel sec 3 q big jump for me alr,btohqsg
Oh ya I just realised also HHAHA,btohqsg
Idk is it because of my NA background aso ðŸ—¿,btohqsg
but my sample size too skewed,btohqsg
Omg its crying over h2 geog,btohqsg
you can do so much if you include more math in,btohqsg
NA was too slow for me but exp was too fast for me,btohqsg
My friend in China take geog they actually go dig fossils,btohqsg
Yea sec 1 NA to sec 2 exp,btohqsg
Don't defame the only subject I liked,btohqsg
Sec sch I went to the beach and threw oranges into the ocean,btohqsg
anyway guys go study past jc physics,btohqsg
Then sec 3 trip sci and now in MII'm that ODD BALL YOO,btohqsg
sg cuz no land space our geog u don't get to experience anything fun,btohqsg
It's not sg dw do tbf  it's literally just impossible to do without massive financial ctst of travelling overseas,btohqsg
True but that's the point why the geog is so boring,btohqsg
Then u just never had a gd geog education LOL,btohqsg
My sch went overseas for geog trip,btohqsg
Lupi lupi loopa loopa doobi doo,btohqsg
why i do h2 physics nvr bring me to nuclear plant,btohqsg
