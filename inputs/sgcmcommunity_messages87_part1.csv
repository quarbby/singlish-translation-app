Fast car but never upgrade handling,btohqsg
Well I mean generally stock cars,btohqsg
Fast car stock no nid upgrade handling. From factory handling match with speed.,btohqsg
But I think car flip is all due to drivers la haha,btohqsg
I said that is becuase I see some drivers ego too big   don’t want give way   but car not fast enough then get to accident,btohqsg
But generally is dangerous driving la,btohqsg
eh but honda jazz more likely to flip,btohqsg
Vezel ez flip cos of height and 1.2ton only right?,btohqsg
But what’s the point got fast car but driver slow,btohqsg
U see some acceding like right turn   car impatient then want to turn right   but car too slow kana t Bone,btohqsg
Family will still be glue sniffers,btohqsg
Or merging lane don’t want give way die die want cut ppl   car also too slow and kana accident,btohqsg
Impatient driver with slow car is a receipt for accident,btohqsg
Gov shud increase speed limit as a whole to not breed a country of glue sniffers if like that,btohqsg
Is not about the speed limit,btohqsg
