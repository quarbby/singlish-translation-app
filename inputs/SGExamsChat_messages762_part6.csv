3k a sem 6k a yr  that is 18k in 3 yrs  for sec school is around 2.5k in 4 yrs. If you somehow manage to accumulate 16k worth of tuition in 4 years  that is 4k yearly solely on tuition. Then you better be in jc,btohqsg
Parents spend 16k extra for you and you go poly to waste another 18k over 4 yrs...that is fucked,btohqsg
