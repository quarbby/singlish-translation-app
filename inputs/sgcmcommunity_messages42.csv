100km/h and “in a jam” don’t work together,btohqsg
Which is a parts shop out selling Mazda stuff,btohqsg

How can you speed and be stuck in a jam at the same time,btohqsg
100 or less. In a traffic jam? Driving on shoulder is it?,btohqsg

Hi. Can I get advise on season parking.I currently own a car registered under my name registered under my current rented condo address.I am shifting to my new home which is a hdb and need to purchase season parking.I should be first tier priority as flat owner and 1st car owner.Upon application however the Carpark is not available and I am given option to chose other further Carpark.Does anyone know is this because I need to change my current car registration address to my new flat first?,btohqsg
Try the last thing you said first,btohqsg
But car got registration address meh,btohqsg
Or maybe you because you got season parking else where already,btohqsg
Then the second one is more ex,btohqsg
No leh the car doesn’t have any current season parking as I am currently living in a rented condo,btohqsg
The car registration address is the same as the lta log card address,btohqsg
But I also feel it should not affect.,btohqsg
I had similar experience in Pasir Ris. Too many 1st car owners  more than the numbers of parking lots available around the area. So I kena buy season parking in the carpark a few blocks away. Boh pian lor. Otherwise kena pay hourly charge at the carpark next to my block. They don't see car registration address  they just see that you are the car owner and your address is there... I managed to get a season parking at my block after 3 or 4 months. Every month try to book on the 18th to get it. Once I got my season parking at my block  I pay for 3 months and after that  not more issue of not being able to get a season parking until I loved out. Now I am at IMH... (behind there hor not inside),btohqsg
Share with all of us here lehhh. I think all of us dying to see it too,btohqsg
Hahahahahaha I love your last sentence disclaimer / punchline. 🤣,btohqsg
That looks like a lovely cabin to be in sir especially at nights. The gear shift  the glooowwwwwwwww 🥰🥰🥰,btohqsg
But if@SGCM_Adminwanna send me a  cashcard  i don’t mind 🙈,btohqsg
you just win the monthly already sir... give other people a chance lehhhhhhhhh... like poor me!,btohqsg
Oh dear. That’s quite ridiculous as 1st car.So you applied on 18th to try as second car application?,btohqsg
Maybe your hdb carpark full already. Try your luck every day. Go into the mobile@hdb app and keep trying. You might get lucky.Alternatively you can shoot them an email or call in to make an appeal,btohqsg
Continue to park at your condo for free until you bought a season parking in HDB#worstadvice🙈,btohqsg
No as first  because consider as new application can only do on 18th,btohqsg

Thats the closest emoji to laughing haha,btohqsg
A picture of me with my car,btohqsg
Apparently I’m not good looking enough,btohqsg
That’s totally uncalled for to delete that image.,btohqsg
Why? Simply because of Carousell that is a competitor? It’s so petty.,btohqsg
I feel admin should not act this way. Displaying a card does not in anyway destroy you,btohqsg
It does not destroy us but it's a subtle reminder of our competitor to everyone in the community who scrolls through the messages.Its similar to how we don't allow ads,btohqsg
It's not that we're petty. It's just the standard protocol,btohqsg
Every chatroom Has their own t&c..No doubt this is a public space  but there shld be certain level of control and permitted content by the admins/owner. Im cool abt this haha👍,btohqsg
That’s not advertisement. He’s only displaying a card he got,btohqsg
I feel this is a echo chamber that you only like to hear what you want you hear.,btohqsg
You continue to do that then nobody dares say anything and you won’t improve,btohqsg
He did not advertise at all,btohqsg
There are much worst chats ard.U cant talk any thing that is not sponsored by their partners.Ws  brands  product  anything.,btohqsg
I mean  admin allows us the give feedback no matter how aggressive we are,btohqsg
🤭🤭 sounds like $60 club to me,btohqsg
Hahaha u know i know ah,btohqsg
I’m not asking you to compare with those worst off.,btohqsg
You have to put yourself in their perspective,btohqsg
If you want to go top level let people have some freedom. He didn’t display ads from Carousell,btohqsg
Chill bro Admin has the rights to remove anything they deem in inappropriate,btohqsg
will a adidas employee wear nike while selling adidas shoe,btohqsg
U r in their space  u adhere to the rules set by them,btohqsg
Admin is the rights to do anything. Yes. But he may not know that doing so is uncalled for,btohqsg

That's sad to hear Mr X,btohqsg
continue renting the condo n rent out your hdb,btohqsg
i do feel this is a echo chamber,btohqsg
Bro ah  not true leh. Imagine you are selling Coca Cola  you want people to blatantly advertise Pepsi in your turf meh,btohqsg
i do feel this is a echo chamber,btohqsg
okay nike shows on adidas employee,btohqsg
not advertising but what are you indirectly promoting,btohqsg
It isnt.. but u wan to direct ur audience to your content,btohqsg
i feel this is a place where people sort of want to hear what they want to hear and gang up against opposing views,btohqsg
yalor but must see smexy julian❤️❤️,btohqsg
he is showing a free card he got from carousell,btohqsg
he aint promoting anything at all,btohqsg
Well  then you have to do it at a neutral platform lor.This one is sgcarmart leh.,btohqsg
The mind works in mysterious ways,btohqsg
this is a place where you join to win free stuff,btohqsg
isnt tht pressurizing sgcm to give out cash cards too?,btohqsg
Yes it is  but it is the content on the free card bro. haha,btohqsg
isnt it indirectly making sgcm to match whatever carousell is giving?,btohqsg
nevermind. this is echo chamber place,btohqsg
Me showing that I got a cashcard from that app,btohqsg
everyone is wrong and i am right,btohqsg
would you want your mazda ceo to drive a toyota?,btohqsg
Is a subtle way of saying “join carousell and you can get free cashcard too”,btohqsg
Don’t forget his famous auntie trolley that he can push me around with 😩,btohqsg
No ah  everyone got diff views and tolerance. I just emphasize on admin/sgcarmart's pov on this. Thats all.No need to go all gungho about different views ah bro.GTIF liao  chill a bit haha,btohqsg
