Yeah hence I‚Äôm thinking of getting a good 4mpd card and just stick to it. I don‚Äôt mind doing the homework but not to the point where I have to think which I have to use to spend on what. Most likely I‚Äôll just do the lazy method to accumulate points,btohqsg
I am on hsbc Revo + citi rewards card. You sound similar to my laziness so I didn't take dbs woman's mastercard becuz their points expire in 1 year üòÖ,btohqsg
Guys.  For 4mpd  amaze x CRMC.  What cards to substitute after exhausting the 1k spend?,btohqsg
Isit better to park money with trust bank or Singlife in this period,btohqsg
General crmc type spend  local offline convert to online non crmc mcc excluded spend,btohqsg
Also for overseas dining spend  what are the cards to use? Miles focused,btohqsg
Does anyone has datapoint on which 4MPD card earn rate is not excluded by vehicle inspection centers (STA/Vicom)? TIA.,btohqsg
For 4mpd on local offline spend  closest are1) uob ppv for mobile contactless for max $1k monthly 2) uob visa signature for min $1k max $2k local contactless/petrol monthly3) HSBC revolution for max $1k contactless for whitelist of MCC,btohqsg

move from RHB to OCBC360 now lol,btohqsg
Seems like ocbc360 is a good deal for saving acct now,btohqsg
Dun worry. The other 2 will follow suit. Then come the time for shopping,btohqsg
loan rate will break 4% also soon,btohqsg
Nobody using BOC smart saver now?,btohqsg
It means OCBC360 interest rate that can be practically achieved has beaten CPF OA and maybe CPF SA and MA as well,btohqsg
But need to fulfill those to reach max interest,btohqsg
salary credit + increase 500$/monthcan reach 4.05% already,btohqsg

Waiting for UOB One to show hand then i can do High interest savings account part 2,btohqsg
Didn't know you had a tiktok üò±,btohqsg
OCBC360 account Salary crediting is transaction code must be SAL also right...,btohqsg
not necessary. i think can just Giro from any other bank account with description ‚ÄúGIRO SALARY‚Äù. could be wrong üòâ,btohqsg
Not sure how wor  my company doesn't credit under that code so DBS Multiplier doesn't qualify them for interest (and thus closed it)Parking my money with Singtel Dash PETS and Trust for now,btohqsg
Curious if u got a existing posb saving acc can ask to convert to multipler account to enjoy the salary saving?,btohqsg
nah  multiplier is a current account while savings is well... savings (also they have different minimum amount requirements),btohqsg
I am using but withdrawing money out.,btohqsg
I'm using the UOB Absolute AMEX card and got billed the annual fee. I successfully got it waived - in this case  should I still pay the billed amount (which is inclusive of the annual fee)? Or billed amount minus the annual fee?,btohqsg
Hello guys any feedback onStandard charted Smart Credit Card?Can those methods earned points?1. Use Simply Go top-up MRT card with the use of the credit card2. Top up Grab / shopee accountThank you,btohqsg
1. Simplygo how to topup MRT Card?2. no,btohqsg
Scb smart just tap on gentry no need top upTip up grab or shoppeecpay wont gain u pointSo no no for both,btohqsg
Sorry  just want to confirm.After I paired my amaze card with citirewards card  does it means I can delete Citi rewards card details from my linked payment methods?Since I am using amaze now for both online and offline payments,btohqsg
Ahh i see.. so as long i pay via AXS before giro deduction then good to go liao right?,btohqsg
what do u mean by linked payment methods? U still need ur CRMC linked to amaze on Instarem side. everything else use Instarem amaze hahaha,btohqsg
pay at least 1 week before giro deduction,btohqsg
DBS Bank has again increased the interest rates on its Multiplier savings account  a day after OCBC made a similar move.https://str.sg/wjgd,btohqsg
Waiting for uob to play the interest game üéÆ haha,btohqsg
No need to delete. Need to keep it linked to charge to CRMC with your amaze card,btohqsg
I mean shopback  Lazada  atome  fairprice app etc... payment method is citirewards card. Now I can delete Citi rewards and replace with amaze card?,btohqsg
Need see feasible interests earn tho... hahaha,btohqsg
Should I remove Citi rewards and replace with amaze card?,btohqsg
That's up to you. For local sgd merchants online i still keep it as CRMC for easier refund purposes (if any)Amaze is more for offline and fx merchants,btohqsg
OCBC still paying better than DBS though - lesser conditions. 100k balance with Salary+$500 growth can give over 4%DBS got too many conditions,btohqsg
Best to pay inclusive  since u will be using the uob absolute subsequently right,btohqsg
Never thought before about the refund process... Shall consider this too  thanks Chris!,btohqsg
Think If don't have credit or insurance or investment just top up $500 min to enjoy the extras 0.10 to 0.40,btohqsg
