Usually refund process is only troublesome from travel related spending. Which is excluded from crmc. So unlikely to use.,btohqsg
No different between iPhone or not in this scenario,btohqsg
You may get cancel and refund from shopee and Lazada too,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s the issue? Just refund loh,btohqsg

All expenses from sup card will be counted as main holder lo. I think only the main holder can earn miles,btohqsg
Yeah I was thinking if the supp card holder would have their own krisflyer number under their name. Guess not.,btohqsg
Another approach  secured card for unqualified human? Guess thatâ€™s the only way,btohqsg
I feel secured cards are not worth it since u lock up funds which could earn higher returns,btohqsg
Next statement  but some people said it will be awarded even before new statement,btohqsg
If buy phones from shopee with credit card from non authorised resellers  js that still eligible for the bonus point mccs?,btohqsg
Well I think there's a difference as android can connect your amaze to Google pay.,btohqsg
I mean for the scenarios mentioned earlier,btohqsg
Never buy phone for shopee  but usually cheaper electronics staff like $100 or less are counted,btohqsg
Not sure if secured card is eligible for SUB.if it is eligible  a 10K FD for UOB Prvi SUB is not too bad ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ provided there is no other way,btohqsg

For this ocbc frank card8% on cash back on online and contactless mobile transactions,btohqsg
Is it I just link credit card to samsung or Google payAnd use the apps to make the transaction?,btohqsg
Yes  but it's $980  being $450 cheaper than singlife. My thought is that the credit doesn't really matter already in this case. some more it's term  cancel anytime  no cash valueðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³,btohqsg
Look for coverage till what age,btohqsg
Is it counted to min spend for UOB One or UOB EVOL too?,btohqsg
Hi  I would like to time the signup of HSBC credit card application. Approx what cashback amount would be considered high? Right now is $150 only  not high right?,btohqsg
Will the MCC still be the same if i use shopback with linked payment method as Maybank Family n Friends? Can i still get cashback from F&F?,btohqsg
Anyone knows the mcc for MBS rise restaurant? Under hotel or dining?,btohqsg
To be clear what I meant is this.Term life that covers till 75 will obviously be much cheaper than term life that covers till 100.The former unlikely to get pay out.The latter will most certainty get pay out.,btohqsg
