Yeah man where my S gang,btohqsg
Because everyone after 2020 is weird,btohqsg
You mean 2000? Actually I believe IC numbers starting with S3 until S66 were never issued.The IC numbers using the year of birth only started in 1967 I believePRs or naturalised citizens born before 1967 (not sure about stateless PRs born in Singapore) were issued IC numbers starting with S2 from my recollection.So technically  they could have issued IC numbers starting with S3 for those born2000-2009  S4 for2010-2019  S5 for2020-2029and S6 for2030-2036. But the problem starts in 2037.,btohqsg
I don't think many people know of the boat service between Changi Point Ferry Terminal (at Changi Village  the same one to Pulau Ubin) and Tg Pengelih in Penggerang  Johor,btohqsg
Then should put legal age as 99 years old. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I don't smoke so I don't care.,btohqsg
A ripe and an unripe banana,btohqsg
They are part of the same bunch. I was suprised the rest ripened but the that green one didn't,btohqsg
Oh! Ya ok thats indeed unique,btohqsg
Raja means king  pisang means banana.Pisang raja means king of bananasIt is a type of banana that is quite sweet. Very nice. They usually use it to make Pisang Goreng,btohqsg
Just like the siblings already mature  but left one still immature  lor,btohqsg
Or most of parts of body mature but brain not mature.,btohqsg
I don't even have a driving licence. Scared to drive,btohqsg
Auto macam toy car driving sia,btohqsg
Not in countries such as the UK,btohqsg
Even no need driver fully auto,btohqsg
And class 3 can drive automatic cars,btohqsg
I thought 3C is only for foreigners?,btohqsg
Even UK auto liao since 10 years ago,btohqsg
Hahaha u learn manual can drive anywhere why even bother with petty discussions for if UK has auto or manual cars,btohqsg
Not true. I've been there for two months this year. I never never seen a auto,btohqsg
My boss BMW all auto liao,btohqsg
Still need push to change gear,btohqsg
3 allows you to drive other motor vehicles not exceeding 2.5T,btohqsg
I getting for free so i dont complain,btohqsg
You didn't have the option to take 3?,btohqsg
Or take grab earn points buy hamburger,btohqsg
Depends where you house is. In Lim Chu Kang  just drive,btohqsg
If you plan to go on road trip overseas  manual is still the way to go especially in US and Europe if you are budget friendly,btohqsg
They don't have COEs so there's a lot more older cars still on manual. You can get auto in the bigger cities but they come at a higher cost in general,btohqsg
You can get a cheap manual car for under 1k SGD in countries like UK,btohqsg
Tbh even in singapore. I got a sick deal on a manual car so I'm driving that everyday. Slopes and jams are kinda overblown problems tbh. Ain't really that hard after the first week or so once you get used to the biting point,btohqsg
u can stick to gear 2 and rev all the way up to 8k to hear Vtec kick in,btohqsg
Tired and a bit of hyperbole.Anyways this day and age is horrible,btohqsg
If i dun eat rice (or at least staple food) i will not feel ok,btohqsg
Ah fk inforgot u from memedef,btohqsg
Wow what indian food. I like indian food quite a lot,btohqsg
i had this in china in December,btohqsg
Oh looks good what dish is this?,btohqsg
That doesnt look like a good biryani,btohqsg
Anyways  hard to find good ingredients in china. We have to search a lot just for basmati rice,btohqsg
But it looks like a delicious mushroom chicken rice,btohqsg
OH!! Didnt know weâ€™re so good,btohqsg
U need to go to authentic muslim indian food kind of place to get good biryani,btohqsg
Coincidentally  my mom's making it right now,btohqsg
Well they are known for the biryani,btohqsg
Yeah  so their curry made me have a bad impression,btohqsg
Their biryani was not bad though,btohqsg
I seeNot so exquisite as a briyani but if u told me is chicken mushroom rice or some chinese rice maybe sounds delicious,btohqsg
The lighting was poor  so I don't know what it actually looks like.,btohqsg
