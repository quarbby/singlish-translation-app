actually i dunno why public stealing the school is involved,btohqsg
like wun it be the police,btohqsg
could be... but then again someone in my level rose from NT to express in 3 yrs,btohqsg
sec 1 was NT and sec 3 became express like a magic show you know,btohqsg
i did not even realise you can progress this fast,btohqsg
not fails but dont put in the effort to do well,btohqsg
like they could go express but instead they decide to go NA..kind of flunking im talking about,btohqsg
in primary school my dad got called to the school coz my brother and some others team up to cyberbully this irritating girl in his class,btohqsg
actually just curious does suspension come first or caning,btohqsg
yea i know this  i never heard of anybody doing the latter,btohqsg
caning shld come first then suspension,btohqsg
then that one guy that joined did the former,btohqsg
my trajectory could be biased solely because the entry of NA for my school was 160,btohqsg
this one is asking for trouble,btohqsg
that is supidly low for a NA stream class,btohqsg
my school i hv not heard of disciplinary cases,btohqsg
but i was from a girls school la,btohqsg
my bro school got someone attempted commit suicide after doing badly for a test  he just walked out and attempt to absailing down the wall lol,btohqsg
then he too scared then call for help to pull him back up,btohqsg
it was a sec 3 and during the sec 4 exam,btohqsg
Uh huh and what's your pt,btohqsg
oh yea talking about this  he never submitted any work  constantly was chased by teachers for work..slept like 60% of the time in class..but magically when it came time to prove in MYE/EOY..bro scores A and B on nearly every subject,btohqsg
Btw is there a limit on the number of posts that can be seen on Twitter,btohqsg
i think my school is ok  not toxic,btohqsg
"my cohort seems like a outlier for all these ""special"" occasions",btohqsg
ok i shall take my leave,btohqsg
Cause I just realised that I can’t see older posts from accounts,btohqsg
Even though when I go to media there are older posts,btohqsg
actually i think corporal punishments end in sec sch,btohqsg
i dun think JCs and stuff have corporal punishments,btohqsg
You do know altho it's a seldom thing to jump from NT to express rite  not saying it's impossible but sure it happens... Just.. like what kuro said it's not like it's a common occurrence where ppl would normally fail PSLE.. it's literally one of the milestones as someone who'd normally  goes thru education in sg,btohqsg
i heard apparently he got anger management issues also,btohqsg
i never meant people purposely failing psle,btohqsg
exactly 2 years ago it was out at midnight,btohqsg
but ye 6-7am is the norm,btohqsg
i didnt know someone can lateral transfer from NT to NA to express,btohqsg
lol i bet some of those people don’t even know what being homophobic really means and they’re just offended on behalf of others,btohqsg
Guys gonna go army then go poly,btohqsg
but they dont dissapear from class 80% of time  are not trouble makers..dont get disciplinary actions like almost every other week.,btohqsg
i think they also trying to find reasons to cook up something against my sis,btohqsg
NT to NA is easy no?,btohqsg
It's damn XIONG and I can only imagine because as you'd know   it's alrd a big ass jump to NA and then from NA to exp is another jump,btohqsg
it's NA to express that's difficult,btohqsg
it is what it is. dumb is dumb,btohqsg
like almost every cohort has someone going from NT to NA,btohqsg
I heard SP is hell bahahaha,btohqsg
yea but for this guy  he did also became disruptive..to the point  there were teachers that basically did not turn up for lessons..and we had to do self studying for those lessons,btohqsg
lol nobody gets transferred in sec 4,btohqsg
SP have but with psychology I did the aptitude test super hard,btohqsg
Then is mass comm leh which poly,btohqsg
