Tbh i also hv beef w some ppl in my class,btohqsg
At least I don't think so la,btohqsg
Wah damn I wish i can just laze on my bed but my body clock is always activated,btohqsg
Tbh i feel exams is spoiling the fun n joy of learningâ€¦But then again w/o exams  it wun work lah  like how to differentiate A with the other x number of students,btohqsg
I speedrun my Japanese so much that I realised I didn't learn much,btohqsg
Then everything will prolly be portfolio + fcfs which is worse actually,btohqsg
Btw is taking jap lessons like expensive?,btohqsg
Im consider learning as 3rd lang or sth when i start work,btohqsg
But yes can be quite costly,btohqsg
I wanna take up n5/4 aft As,btohqsg
I did 1 mod of japanese,btohqsg
She did a Jap Lesson thru Uni what I tot,btohqsg
Then the last sem i wanted to take econs so badly lol,btohqsg
+ learning a lang on top of other exams is a head pain,btohqsg
No la I thought she graduated liao so probably can't do with NUS anymore,btohqsg
I dun think i would be able to cope tbh,btohqsg
Plus 1 mod of Japanese lesson is probably not enough,btohqsg
Oh i did 1 module of Jap in y3,btohqsg
But then it is not easy to score coz the competitiveness,btohqsg
^ yeah my friend is doing it till Level 5,btohqsg
Starting at Level 2 cuz he got some prior knowledge,btohqsg
Probably can try for N5 but Japanese 1 still need to do some self studying,btohqsg
Bruh some ppl bluff they dunno shit then go L1,btohqsg
U do that if u wan the AUs,btohqsg
But it's very inefficient and waste of time if u doing it for AUs,btohqsg
Coz i heard jap L1 to L2 is a big jump?,btohqsg
Japanese learning is actually pretty steep,btohqsg
Language mods need a lot of practice time either ways,btohqsg
But L1 and L2 uses the same book so i kinda can self learn jap L2,btohqsg
Especially from really beginner to beginner,btohqsg
So even if u got prior knowledge the time u waste on a topic u know is debatable,btohqsg
Yea definitely nd for jap  u need a good partner also,btohqsg
Fr 0 to beginner is also q a jump,btohqsg
Same at the end of the day it's just numbers on the screen,btohqsg
It is a huge jump no question about that,btohqsg
Even my friend with prior knowledge come out with A-,btohqsg
Because you need to learn hiragana  katakana,btohqsg
I think i got B or sth,btohqsg
From there welcome to the grammar of Japanese,btohqsg
Oh yea it is opposite of english,btohqsg
Lang mods imo very inefficient if your goal is solely for AU and GPA,btohqsg
my core mods all c  so fun,btohqsg
But tbh the jap 1 grammar js ok,btohqsg
So Japanese 1 to probably early Japanese 3 you will get whacked by the verb forms a lot,btohqsg
Neh that aint my sole goal,btohqsg
That's usually the goal for those who smurf level 1,btohqsg
Then who knows i went on to visit jpn 2 more times,btohqsg
By early Japanese 3 probably you are ready for N4,btohqsg
From there it is quite a lot of vocabluary,btohqsg
And then maybe until Japanese 4 you can try for N3 liao,btohqsg
