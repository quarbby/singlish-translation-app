How to transfer money out from grab ah?,btohqsg
Bopian. Can try asking Grab for a refund. Or use AXS to pay off your credit card bill via PayNow QR. (idm leaking this secret now bc it's gonna be dead in less than 48 hours),btohqsg
if top up with cc  i know a way: transfer to wise but with more than 2% fee charged  then transfer from wise to your local bank.,btohqsg
Not allowed. Grab blocked off topups to Wise,btohqsg
eh  is it new? because i just did last month.,btohqsg
Sad day for Grab-paynow hackBut anyway  do give the newly launched GXS (Grab-Singtel) bank a try. Free 2500 grabpoints and 3.48% pa (but only up to 5k),btohqsg
I was under the impression that it was killed in Nov 2022  but turns out Wise might have come out unscathed,btohqsg
i think revolut  bigpay is nerfed in Nov. wise is not included but with massive fee  so not worthy to do it.,btohqsg
The gxs is worth to try if u get acces to it just standalone Grab already nerf until nothing,btohqsg
Any idea if Geneco allows early prepayment ?,btohqsg
I think they never block wise since they charge a fee for card topups,btohqsg
