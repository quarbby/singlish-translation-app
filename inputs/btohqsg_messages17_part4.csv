Does anyone know  when is the Sin Ming BTO? As per news article it says May or August  but I don't see it under the launches listed... Thanks in advance,btohqsg
From the looks of it and the report  it should be here - beside blk25.Dropped pinhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/kZkJz27UyBMtLpWW8?g_st=ic,btohqsg
It‚Äôs built in advance of the typical Btolaunch announcement. Have to wait for hdb to officially release the details,btohqsg
Tiagong it's to house those nearby who may get SERS  thus neh announce,btohqsg
Hello im currently schooling (grad next tear) and my partner has been working has been working for a year. Is it better to apply for a resale  bto or sbf? Because i saw that for ehg  the lower the income the better the grant. If i apply for bto am i able to apply for the ehg now or when i collect the keys?,btohqsg
Bto n sbf got difference?? Both new flats ma,btohqsg
sbf can also include new flats from earlier BTO sales that could be already TOP and are not booked / taken back by HDB for whatever reason,btohqsg
But still consider new flats. I feel,btohqsg
The lease may not be 99,btohqsg
the lease period could be different if its already completed,btohqsg
From TOP date la. I understand,btohqsg
Difficult to answer. Depends on your objective and needs and priority,btohqsg
If just to max out grants yes apply when lowest income,btohqsg
Tat one call hdb to ask better,btohqsg
Buying hdb is definitely more than just maxing out grants esp your first home.,btohqsg
Draw out a decision matrix and weigh each requirement with score to help u,btohqsg

Hello all  if I‚Äôm applying a bto with my sis and my mom (second timer)  able to get matured estate area?,btohqsg
mature estate i think only reserve 5% of flats for second timers  application rate will be mad crazy  need luck to get q number for mature estatetampines and amk for aug 2022 second timer application rate for 5r was 200+ for 1 5r flat  around 100 for 1 4r flatkallang proj in nov 2022  90+ vying for 1 4rqueenstown proj for feb 2023 was 40+ for 1 4r,btohqsg
Getting 3 room is much better?,btohqsg
It just pure luck for second timer,btohqsg
getting 3 room mature estate is better  but application rate is still pretty bad  around 40+ for 1 3r flat,btohqsg
Ya I'm looking for that also.. super looking forward to it.. my balcony..,btohqsg
From HDB website they say estimate completion is Q2 2024,btohqsg
Where to find 2 room flexi price?,btohqsg
May I know usually 1st (selection of flat) to 2nd appointment (making downpayment) how long it will take?,btohqsg
Is HLE is required in second appointment?,btohqsg
So that‚Äôs the only time they will assess income?,btohqsg
i think they will access again when u pick up the keys to ur flat. Just to make sure that there are no major changes to ur income,btohqsg
They will assess again just before key collection. As your salary would either increase or decrease it would affect your loan amount...,btohqsg
Mine took 20 months but that‚Äôs coz they took their own sweet time approving my ehg,btohqsg
Oh really we took 7 months to approve,btohqsg
