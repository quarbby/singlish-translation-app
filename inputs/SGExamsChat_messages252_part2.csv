But still. All these should not stop you all from taking the vaccine,btohqsg
moderna is more severe than pfizer,btohqsg
I don't feel any side effect.,btohqsg
Other than my arm is swelling.,btohqsg
i mean they say the stronger ur immune system the more likely for adverse side effects,btohqsg
True. But even if you got no side effects it doesn't mean the vaccine isn't working,btohqsg
I heard the fever occurrence rate for moderna is lower than Pfizer according to clinical trials. But considering all side effects  according to sg data  moderna (74.8%) does have more frequent side effects than Pfizer (64.2%). But also  the risk of anaphylaxis to the Moderna vaccine is about half or less than half of the Pfizer vaccine,btohqsg
My arm started to ache a bit alr HAHA,btohqsg
side effects was fever for about three days plus leg numb super tired arm weakness lasting for more than 2 weeks,btohqsg
