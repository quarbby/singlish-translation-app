genius if i can write that tiny even with a ball point pen...i dun think anyone can,btohqsg
actually i can get the points of those comments  coz it will be wasted if cambridge cant recognise the handwritting,btohqsg
"My friend got the comment""Consider the view that your handwriting confuses more than informs""Cuz she wrote a qn for gp:""Consider the view that the media confuses more than informs""",btohqsg
this one im pretty sure  it is not dementia,btohqsg
But they don't call it de moivre,btohqsg
But I think MOST recent batch,btohqsg
ok la  just that it's more of used using polar form then the actual version,btohqsg
Cuz they removed polar form rite,btohqsg
i thought now complex numbers is only cartesian form,btohqsg
so this is last year with polar,btohqsg
i think i can only remember chem phy and econs,btohqsg
math totally flew out of my brain,btohqsg
ya  if not later cause too many bipolar disorder,btohqsg
remembering chem is fun  remembering math is insane,btohqsg
"""I beg you to write quicker""",btohqsg
maths is to be appreciated  not remembered,btohqsg

YT hand writing isn't that bad,btohqsg
Uk I considered paying to see my gp exam script,btohqsg
Ciz I wanted to see their comments,btohqsg
How much does it cost these days arh or isit even possible anymore,btohqsg
