That's why drink stall is always owner's biz,btohqsg
I just use a simple case  the same tin of can drink in Sheng Siong sold is $1 per can  at coffeeshop  they sold it at $2.10,btohqsg
Fruit juice best  say 1 pineapple cost $1.50  you can make 3 drinks that sell $3.30/cup,btohqsg
So drinks earn the most.You look at those Gong Cha  the margin is damn high,btohqsg
Better than fry a plate of noodle,btohqsg

Ya. If developer before complete project go bankrupt but already collected your bank or you took bank loan to buy you still hv to pay bank although property in limbo. Olden days singapore also like that but Govt corrected it but often happens in Malaysia. My friend said his condo developer changed hands at least 2-3 times  not only loss in property value in RM further s$-RM exchange loss.,btohqsg
