Any tips for memorising Social studies,btohqsg

Isnâ€™t there only like 8 marks out of 50 unless if the syllabus has changed. Cos I thought itâ€™s 35 marks sbq and 15 seq. And of the 15 marks essay the 7 marks one doesnâ€™t need memo and only the 8 marks one need,btohqsg
Think about constraints and benefits. Even for the 8 mark memo question even if you didnâ€™t memorise you could use common sense and still get 2-3 marks. So if you need to spend many hours to memorise 10 chaps of content just to get that 6 marks more I think itâ€™s certainly more worth it spending time on your elect geog/hist to memorise content since there are more marks for questions that requires memory  unless if youâ€™ve been consistently mugging and think you can afford to spend time on SS. I barely memorised anything for SS since I spent most of my revision on elect geog and could still get A1. imo itâ€™s better to do sbq practices for SS to make sure you get the structure right and have a sense on whether youâ€™re making the right inferences so you can score well for that,btohqsg
And coming from someone who have abit of work experience. Marks doesn't do anything to help you better yourself in the work place. Only thing it gets you is opportunity. Doing well and being successful boils down to your personality.,btohqsg
Cause I dun want to see people because of low marks or something they do something stupid,btohqsg
It comes from your interpretation at the end of the day,btohqsg
It boils down to who has more knowledge on the world. Example: I dun stay in touch with the small news that happens daily but I like reading on inflation  current trends and such,btohqsg
If u happen to not have any knowledge then best you can do is to try to smoke,btohqsg
Like what u said about SS,btohqsg
And if let's say at the end of the day or life u dun accomplish anything great and worthy of mention then so be it. Least u were brave enuff to continue down your journey.Life should not be taken super seriously because it will backfire on your mental health.,btohqsg
Coming from a guy that likes philosophy,btohqsg
At this point if u dun know then not much u can do,btohqsg
Best you can do is ask for last minute advice?,btohqsg
