PPF and ceramic coating are 2 different things and not meant to be substitutes for each other. PPF is a film that is attached to the car that is designed to work like your phone's screen protector and protect it from stone chips and minor scratches. Ceramic coating is just a chemical fluid applied to the surface of the paint that makes the surface slick  making it look glossy  smooth and easier to clean. PPF can last 10 years and newer better films do not yellow in normal circumstances. ceramic coating wears off over time (2-3 years) and will need to be reapplied to maintain it's effect,btohqsg
PPF is very costly and labour intensive and only recommended for expensive paint colours which are costly to respray  or if you have car colours which swirl easily like flat black. ceramic coating is the one you want to make it look glossy and easier to clean but it will not protect the surface in any way. it is also much much cheaper. I would recommend ceramic coating for 90% of people. the 10% who need ppf will know what it does and why they need it,btohqsg
The film need to peel off subsequently?,btohqsg
it only needs to be peeled off if it yellows or peels or is damaged to the point you need a new film to replace it,btohqsg
this peeling off thing you're asking about is probably because of wrapped cars. wrapping is different  it is applied with heat instead of ppf which is using a different film material and applied to a wet car. normal wrap does not last more than 2-3 years and will eventually need to be peeled off. ppf is meant to be semi permanent,btohqsg
yes both is done for the ballers but you can combine them together and the effect is truly stunning,btohqsg
Lol when money is not an issue  always do both!,btohqsg
but if you are driving a 116 please dont bother,btohqsg
Actually these days got special effect ppf that can turn your paint into a matte look,btohqsg
yeah satin ppf. basically a matt screen protector film instead of gloss,btohqsg
Why sia 116 😭 I used to drive that it's a good entry level bimmer,btohqsg
its better than matt paint even because matt paint becomes shiny after a while. with matt ppf you get the matt look but no need to worry about ruining the finish,btohqsg
no lah cos there was that dude asking about entry level conti and showing you made it,btohqsg
Buy 116 and 740 also same badge  so just spend within my means,btohqsg
you got money  ppf whatever car you want,btohqsg
Go jb and ppf the front 4 pc,btohqsg
a friend of mine did a ppf in JB for about 1/3 the price of SG. the job was HORRIBLE. full of air bubbles and dirt specks under the film. When he brought it back to rectify  they peeled off the layer and because they anyhow peel  they took off some of his paint with it. WORST JOB EVER DO NOT RECOMMEND. PPF is very expensive and takes skilled labour so please dont save this kinda money. I would recommend instead to save the ppf money and respray the car again after its scratched up. in most cases will cost about the same,btohqsg
there are probably good ones in malaysia but the cost savings will be less,btohqsg
Had a similar experience with my last car. Wrapped in SG and cost me $2K. Within a week I had air bubbles. Decided to remove the wrap and respray instead.,btohqsg
got spray on PPF also right? are they good?,btohqsg
pretty much the same thing... spray on a thick coat and let it cure,btohqsg
Full car wrap 2k? That’s cheap for PPF,btohqsg

What's ur usage? if u drive short trip most of the time  fc definitely not within spec. accurate fc is about 20km per trip.,btohqsg

that explains why ur fc is so bad. engine needs time and distance to reach optimal operating condition. short trip doesn't help.,btohqsg
But is there anything I can do,btohqsg
right foot training. drive smooth. look far ahead to predict when to slow down by using engine brake instead of foot brake. basically let down ur ego and do ur best to use 1 pedal only to drive smoothly.,btohqsg
it is doable. my brake pads are almost 120000km but still 40% thick. smooth driving save lots of money.,btohqsg
U physically go measure yr pad?,btohqsg
no la. when do servicing  i will ask the workshop about my brakepad thickness.,btohqsg
Lol. Is it easy to change the brake pad ourselves,btohqsg
It’s a super dirty job. Yucks. I’ll leave it to the jhk to do it,btohqsg
do u know the price of the better brands? i used to consider ppf but heard of the yellowing and high cost so i went for coating instead. if can last more than 5 years it could be more worth it.,btohqsg
for 740i  i think consider not bad considering the weight,btohqsg
u need proper tools. good jack so car wont collapse on you. torque wrench because u need to remove wheels and torque back properly after install. and also some safety concern especially old pads that have cancer causing substance.,btohqsg
