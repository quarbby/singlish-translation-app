Am still holding Sinarmas and Wee Hur as I believe that they still have huge upside over short term given their low PE and PB ratio.Added China Everbright and SIIC as they've low PE and PB  and given the huge China Gov's stimulus  I think interest will come after market see how fast the sp of depressed s-chips such as Yanlord and Sunpower turned around in just a few sessions.There are already sign of liquidity flowing to the two counters since yesterday  small but steady.Here are some data on China Everbright:- Share price- 25.5 - 26c- EPS 7c (PE x 3.7)- NAV 67c (PB x 0.38)- Div 2.12c (Yield 8.1%) on 30% payout- Gearing 60.7% against Industry Avg of 65 - 70%- Avg Interest Rate ~ 2.67%- ROC of 10% and hence mgt guided to keep gearing to 60.7% but will go for more asset light biz in future.DYODD yah,btohqsg

Amongst PUT  KORE and MUST  PUT is the most generous with a 1 for 10 bonus issue in Mar 24. It also gave 0.18c div (for 1H24) which is 10% of the 1H24 distributable income. It is keeping the 90% to show large potential tenants that they have strong balance sheet and probably also because it is building up cash to buy distressed assets.. Let's see if it will give another 1 for 10 bonus share in Mar 25.At about 18c  yield is  20% if it can sustain the distribution income  which I think is highly. Rental renewal in 1H24 is mere drop of -1.3% (Versus MUST of -10.5%) showing the rental resilience and its asset quality (note: also fr recent sale of OWT at only 3.3% discount fr book while MUST had to sell at 26% discount fr book valuation in Dec 23).It will lose about 6% income fr the absense of OWT it just sold but i think should be compensated by the increasing occupancy fr current avg of 84% to above 90% in 12 to 18 months fr other buildings but may be even earlier given a few indication:1) PUT's Park Tower (10.6% contribution in carrying value) may be close to increase occupancy fr 68.1% to 90%. This alone will add 2% income.2) A large tenant at Village Centre II (100% occupancy) is considering to take up a sizable space in Village Center I (55% occupancy).I see that we may enjoy full DPU (20% yield) by 1H 25 in 9 month time. Lets see how Q3 result looks like and we will know how fast ita recovers  and if we are moving in the correct direction. DYODD yah!Will add more if it comes down to next support at 17.4c. DYODD yah..Cheers,btohqsg

Yesterday greenbuild showed resilllence when $0.053 level buyers absorbed almost all the sellers in the day.T+4 over. Can start to watch more closely. Looks pivoted and likely to bounce off this support level.DYODD,btohqsg
Note that Green Build rallied crazy on 9th Sept 24 and hit and high of $0.10x before retracing back.Current price $0.053 is almost half of that recent highDYODD.,btohqsg
On the 27th Sept  MediLifestyle rallied from $0.012 to $0.014 but suddenly  there was an odd big single seller.Now  we know it‚Äôs because they sold off these guys shares to recoup back some $Do note that MediLifestyle is going after the seller of a biz that bought earlier on as the profit guarantee did not hit and if the legal side pursue of it works out  this seller shall have to make good of the shortfall equivalent to the profit target based at an issue price of $0.025.(Almost double of current price)Source:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/5N8MZ3CGO9O01WQ1/820821_Medi%20-%20Ann%20in%20relation%20to%20PG%20-%2020241002.pdf,btohqsg
ISOTeam had some crazy volume selling on Tuesday where most of the transactions was big sell down at $0.057. Yet  it cleared back $0.058 and closed $0.059 yesterday.Can tell that this counter is very cornered and controlled. Hence  if enter  best is to have that holding powered.For some who don‚Äôt know what cornered stock means. Usually it means there is some people who holds quite a big chunk of the counter and with that  is able to control the price of the stock price  whether up or down.Anyways  looks like they have broken out of the pressure line although there seems so many sellers selling done 58 and then 57 but yet it could recover easily could give a tell on the main directional bias.But DYODD,btohqsg
