hey guys could i get some opinions related to CCs for travel (booking tour/hotels (on 3rd party sites eg tripdotcom  agoda  etc.))context: hotel booking probably once every 2-3 months. next feb might go on a tour with family estimated around 16k++ spend (not sure if can split payment for multiple CCs haha)thinking of getting UOB lady's for the sign up promo as im planning a trip in nov and have no cards (CRMC  OCBC infinity & SC smart) useful for travel bookings. this card's great for as it doesnt have min spend & will select travel category and probably only use it for travel related bookings. currently dont have anything in UOBi saw that theres heymax also (i.e.  i could book hotels through that). i think this is the best way to book as i could stack the rewards?neither miles nor cashback team. just racking up points on CRMC. looking for no minimum spend cards üò© i think 300-400 minimum spend is okay though!what could be a more efficient way to do this? or is there any CC suggestion for the given context above? thank you!,btohqsg
Curious  when you go overseas  is it better to spend using Revolute/YouTrip  compared to UOB One card?Even if I can earn MPD  I am concerned about the forex rates of UOB compared to the rates of Revolute/Youtrip.,btohqsg
Uob one is a cashback card thou,btohqsg
3.x% is vs Aug balance1% (from everyday+ rewards) is vs Sep balance,btohqsg
If your concern is cash then try amaze wallet or trust cashback,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs say you value miles at 1.25 cents per mile. 4mpd is eq 5% cashback. Bank fcy fee and cc spread will be around 4%. You still get net positive. üòÜRedo the maths  plug in your own value of mile and see if its worth it.,btohqsg
I think the rental income is added to your annual income and your tax will be dependent on the income tax bracket you fall into. You also need to pay much higher property tax.,btohqsg
Hi all. I do most of my shopping on shopee. Would maribank account or credit card be good for this?,btohqsg
Hi guys  Im 16 with 200dollars in my bank and im looking to invest. Do you guys have any advice?,btohqsg
200 dollars may not yield a good amount of interest if you thinking of investment. I suggest start growing your money using the digital banks with 2.X% interest free.,btohqsg

"Hi Guru users of moomoo  has anyone encountered being charged interest for withdrawing from your moomoo cash account to your bank account ""before it is settled""?",btohqsg

Sharing a case here for everyone's awareness,btohqsg
Go Holland use YouTrip card and go airport take tax rebate and opt for tax rebate via credit card .. the money will go back to YouTrip ?,btohqsg
Hi  I think I'm in the same position as you. Can't really do any investment since every investment app need you to be 18 and above and verify by singpass. So I what did is put the money in my GXS saving account and let the daily interest come in while you go to work.Anything  just DM me. I can help you as well,btohqsg
Posted and settled is different.Once posted it will be given margin value which u can then use to withdraw your OTHER cash that‚Äôs settled.I would agree their wording can be improved but it‚Äôs not wrong to charge u interest for withdrawing cash that hasn‚Äôt been settled.,btohqsg
Hi folks  I am going to Taiwan and Japan in coming week. Would like to know which are the credit cards you will recomnend to bring there.I have most of the credit cards  but would not want to bring too many cards there  so I am thinking to bring these cards:1. Amaze - can use with CRMC  Lady Solitaire  OCBC TR2. UOB Visa signature - for foreign spending3. Trust - to withdraw money there4. Youtrip - to use the Japanese Yen that I have in this cardAny other cards that I should bring? Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
1. Remove ur uob lady from amazeI think you can pick either trust or youtrip. No need both.,btohqsg
Unless you need to hit UoB one $500 spend and the transaction is not in the selected category   or they have remove it from eligible spend too üòï,btohqsg
Hi newbie here. Was looking at sp500. May I know why cspx is currently 600usd++ but voo only 500usd++?,btohqsg
thanks for the advice... forgot Uob no longer support Amaze..,btohqsg
Yes.. have to meet the uob one 500 spending requirement...so I will have to bring this card there as cant use with Amaze or have to use with Google play..,btohqsg

"Thank you for replying!Didnt know that could be the case. But i still so unjustified. Does it mean we can actually withdraw (like borrow) from the margin account even when the cash amount is zero?As a user  I cant seem to find when the amount is ""settled""  how am I suppose to ensure that i dont withdraw too early when i cant even see the settled dateü§ØFeel so scammedüò±",btohqsg
Different tickers have different prices is common  even VOO vs SPY is different,btohqsg
I would like to deposit fresh fund into UOB one account to hit the max bonus interest of 4%  may I know does it also qualify for the savings promo if I lock in for the 5 months qualifying period?,btohqsg
Yes. As the account has margin facility u can borrow.Ibkr displays 2 figures when u withdrawSgd20 000 assuming margin loanSgd3 000 cashAbove example means u can draw out $3k no issue. U draw out $18k  means $15k is on Margin loan.Does moo moo have this,btohqsg
"But now my cash account is zero. I try to withdraw ""All""  the max i can withdraw is zero. I dont see how i could have ""borrowed"" from them that time.ü§Ø",btohqsg
Fresh found is counted against sep mab  so u need to check your sep mab first then register then add fund,btohqsg
If you are using UOB Evol n target the  FX 10%   need to bring physical card to paywave. Mobile contactless(eg. Applepay/Gpay) is excluded from FX 10% n will only be included in SGD online/mobile contactless.,btohqsg
Sorry for digging this up but that‚Äôs the pros of this combo over say Youtrip or revolut?,btohqsg
8% cashback for about2.8%2% fee from Amaze. You gain net positive as compared to youtrip.,btohqsg
mab refers monthly available balance? Noted  thanks,btohqsg

hi any DBS card users  the payment due date in ibanking is the statement date? or the statement date is before the payment due date üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi guys! I' thinking about applying for the StanChart Smart Credit Card. Quick question - can I snag both the official rewards and the singsaver rewards at the same time?Also  between singsaver and moneysmart  which one would you recommend?Let me know what you think!,btohqsg
Statement date is before payment due. Due date is usually 25-27 days after statement date  depending on different banks.,btohqsg
oh cuz i just got the card approved last fri  payment due date shows 7 Nov  so abit confused when is the statement date  is there anywhere I can view it?,btohqsg
Click the eDocument to see your statement in pdf copy once it is published in your account few days later.DBS generated the statement last night.,btohqsg
Ah yes. I didn't read it fully. 2.8% was referring to amaze + Maybank. Using naked maybank will give closer to 4% markup as compared to utrip,btohqsg
