It could be your posted date was captured in next month statement. Let's say your statement date is on 15 of the month  try not spend on like 13 to 15  that's my recommendation because most bank use posted date to count for rebate!,btohqsg
Not really. Because my statement bill total was around 1600. Almost 500 from Airbnb then the rest should be from Apple Pay,btohqsg

Hi! I‚Äôm not a pro investor but it is good that you have the thoughts to start early!! I too had the same thought as you but didn‚Äôt really take action to invest until recent years which I regret not starting early. I believe you don‚Äôt need a huge amount to start la  probably u can see those videos by Chris   I remember there was a video that can help u to invest every month via webull into stocks like S&P 500 even if it‚Äôs $100 you can start something and learn along the way. Don‚Äôt be afraid to lose that few hundreds.. just start and learn along the way and also read up while you go on your investing journey.. üëèüèª,btohqsg

there is a minimum cost per order.. IBKR is about $0.37.. Not sure if it will be wise to DCA everyday. Maybe it's ok for other brokers,btohqsg
