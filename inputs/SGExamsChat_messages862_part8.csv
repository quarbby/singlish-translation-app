ya the stoichiometry a lot math,btohqsg
Honestly  h2 chem is an eye opener,btohqsg
i feel like i read the question then quite hard to visualize whatâ€™s going on with the elements and reactions,btohqsg
I have a friend who studied chemistry in poly   she said the electronic configuration taught in o level won't work in poly or jc,btohqsg
Like poly jc much closer to real world chemistry,btohqsg
I wld say I just draw out the scenario ans figure out what went in and what went out,btohqsg
The one taught in o levels is very simplified model,btohqsg
Cus the thing is for jc poly chemistry  we dont deal with the 2D flattened shape,btohqsg
yep been drawing out the stuff esp when they do back titrations and what not,btohqsg
helps a bit w the visualization,btohqsg
Yea but I wld say the math do get quite hard sometimes,btohqsg
Even i tried to make my own notes and it still failed on me haha,btohqsg
howâ€™s jc for you if you donâ€™t mind sharing,btohqsg
I do believe that you might wanna try rereading the notes first,btohqsg
Cus like some of the methods are a bit copy paste,btohqsg
My jc life was somewhat weird uh,btohqsg
even tho i went in through ip but so far it feels quite intimidating,btohqsg
I took double cca which was pretty abnormal,btohqsg
Mine is not the ip route but like the jump was there uh,btohqsg
I mean i did get some Ds and Es but in my mind as long as they werent U grades lmao,btohqsg
J1 Sem 2 is the hardcore one,btohqsg
Mostly cus of cca and pw,btohqsg
seems like the rides gonna be bumpy from here ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I tried taking double cca in poly but failed haha ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
can really feel the pace pick up and the pressure of the content,btohqsg
Yea but honestly if you come to jc  just try to push yourself to not get a U or S grade first for J1,btohqsg
At least try to hit the promotional criteria,btohqsg
they covered like 40 pages of notes during a lecture last time  just speeding through everything,btohqsg
Ah yea  they do that sometimes.,btohqsg
Random hack  if you are the kind that read first before coming lecture,btohqsg
I recommend doing tutorials during lecture,btohqsg
"Esp during the ""slightly boring"" portions",btohqsg
Like u can listen to lecture uh,btohqsg
But there will some cases where you just stare into space or like just lowkey dunno what they talking about,btohqsg
Wld not recommend doing that for humanities or memorisation subjecys but more for subjects that requires math,btohqsg
so js chem for me ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
oh yeah thatâ€™s quite relatable sometimes,btohqsg
Yea but for me i multitask,btohqsg
if the way the school teaches doesn't work for you  then find your own way,btohqsg
The only time i listen is mostly for corrections/answers to their lecture qns,btohqsg
But i dont listen during their nagging sessions hahaha,btohqsg
okay i might try ur tutorial thing out next time see if itâ€™s helpful,btohqsg
also my school does this thing where like we go through the content on our own first then do sls to ask questions,btohqsg
lecture time is where they go through some of the frequently asked questions,btohqsg
Yea tbh i was part of the precovid batch,btohqsg
Technology wasnt very enhanced for us lmao,btohqsg
Also I sometimes read lecture notes while on train or bus,btohqsg
Like is more of either to look at new content or to revise,btohqsg
Is like 10 seconds later  you realise 2 days have passed by,btohqsg
Always take care of your health oso,btohqsg
