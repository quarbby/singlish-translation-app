gg im actually tempted to apply SIA against my parent’s wishes,btohqsg
just go  you miss 100% of the shots you don't take,btohqsg
Just tell them you become manager at sia,btohqsg
I think a managerial position would sit more better with them than a customer service oriented position,btohqsg
I need to find one first,btohqsg
precisely  musician's parents will flip if she goes to a customer service oriented position,btohqsg
Actually i alr found some i interested in,btohqsg
Who knows maybe flip her into another country,btohqsg
I previously didnt know SIA has many roles apart from cabin crews and pilots,btohqsg
There is like 145 mostly entry level jobs,btohqsg
it's inevitable  you need lots of people to support the operations of a global airline,btohqsg
just go for those that require a bachelor's degree  ignore the diploma positions,btohqsg
that filters out a lot of the 145 already,btohqsg
I will take some time tonight to filter things out,btohqsg
But omo yes i know it is hard to get into SIA,btohqsg
But if i dun try  it is a definite no,btohqsg
you’re getting all 4 big areas in one sem. QM  classical mechanics  EM  stat mechanics (a bit in the tech applications mod),btohqsg
imagine what it was prior to the tuition,btohqsg
Herro ma næ iş E rong ma,btohqsg
Damn i hv a friend who is in korea for 1m and fr her ig stories  it seems like she is ‘staying and chilling’ there,btohqsg
Ngl I miss the convenience stores there,btohqsg
I would hv spent way more if i did not control myself,btohqsg
How many famichikies did u consume?,btohqsg
My main concern abt applying to SIA now is ltr dk if it will be difficult to go elsewhere unless im prepared to stay in SIA till retirement (which i may be would considering how much i hate interviews),btohqsg
?? U don't have to stay in SIA for your entire career,btohqsg
We as young ppl can and should job hop.,btohqsg
You pay a loyalty tax if you stay in the same company for too long  job hopping keeps you moving up the ladder,btohqsg
One of my relatives did that,btohqsg
1 month trip to Korea with her bestie,btohqsg
Wah how come so many leaves,btohqsg
hi  does anyone have any recommendations for jc tutors teaching alvls syllabus?,btohqsg
Eh isn't self promotion or ad against the rules? BAN JUN WEI,btohqsg
ok la  it was an honest question by YS,btohqsg
Was gonna say jk given the enormous contribution that u have as an old timer,btohqsg
come to think of it  really here for some time liao,btohqsg
until the next kid coming out soon,btohqsg
Damn u have been busy ma dude,btohqsg
the govt never survey me on TFR issues,btohqsg
step 1  a one-time guaranteed Cat A/B COE for families with 3 kids and above below a certain age for a low price.Help families with young children able to travel around.Public transport not friendly enough for families with more young children,btohqsg
They just gonna give you a decommissioned taxi,btohqsg
U do that I guarantee u the birth rates magically skyrocket,btohqsg
step 2  bring back executive flats  6 rm flats. Only families with 3 kids and above can apply.,btohqsg
That one is like CDC vouchers give is just so they can say they doing something,btohqsg
How many family nucleus are there in sg ah,btohqsg
If every taxi that was nearing decommissioning was given or sold cheaply to households  that would increase tfr?,btohqsg
every taxi that is nearing decommissioning will have so much mileage on it that it wouldn't be worth much at all.,btohqsg
I mean they can sell it at a subsidized price compared to scrap metal value the govt gets+ for the govt  it brings in more eventually money when maintenance etc is added by owners of said decommissioned vehicles in the long run but should not exceed for car owners the 10-15k price range of a 1 yr old car with coe,btohqsg
just just to double cfm eae closing date for O lvl is from 20th-26th june right,btohqsg
