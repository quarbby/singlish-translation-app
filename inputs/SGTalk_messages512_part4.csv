Kena cursed by non smokers lo. Windows all closed except those for ventilation  come back from holiday  macam the izakaya came back with us.,btohqsg
Luckily my neighbours left right non smokers..Then my unit is the long corridor to next unit,btohqsg
Wha! Where he get such kangtao?!,btohqsg
I used to roll that too.. When I'm rolling in my bed,btohqsg
My uncle roll that. Then there's gudang garam too.,btohqsg
Tt gudang is the sweet smelling one,btohqsg
You protect me from all the insects?,btohqsg
With the piak piak sound. ü§≠,btohqsg
i didn‚Äôt link smokers per se  i said that the smoking in lifts were a low ses issue as per the socio aspect in ses  and if you do honestly think what you‚Äôre spewing is wisdom you got another think coming kek,btohqsg
Get the 3M ultrathon. Mozzie ËøúÁ¶ª‰Ω†.,btohqsg
it‚Äôs conform / comply not confirm,btohqsg
Wa. So many soup based food. You thirsty?,btohqsg
At least you dont light yourself on fire after rolling in a blanket.,btohqsg
Again  it's not limited to a ses issue  if your brain only has that difference on its mind  none of us here can help you.,btohqsg
Thank you for pointing out the wrongly autocorrected word,btohqsg
you were the one who linked it to finances,btohqsg
it‚Äôs linked to both societal and economic,btohqsg
if not for your constant use of ad hominem  you might have made a little more sense,btohqsg
Again  you were the one who linked it  where my rebuttal was that it's not limited to a low ses environment only  as you implied.,btohqsg
If not RWS and MBS halls won't reek of smoke.,btohqsg
The only SES I knows. üòî,btohqsg
my response was to the issue about smoking in the lifts  which shows the inability to conform to societal standards  you are the clown who thinks that people unable to follow rules in a hdb is equivalent to people who book mbs smoking rooms and are well within their rights to smoke in said smoking rooms,btohqsg
I must say I don't recall them.,btohqsg
It's ok young man. This kpop is my era one.,btohqsg
your liao more than maggie mee,btohqsg
Again  the clown is the one who thinks that the air in MBS and RWS solely comes from smoking rooms and that it's their right. üòèSG laws banned smoking in air-conditioned places and includes lifts.So go ahead and do as you please because you don't seem to comprehend what I said regardless of phrasing.,btohqsg
High ses is Liao more than mee.Low ses is Mee more than Liao.,btohqsg
haiya. i low ses cause i use lift. high ses don‚Äôt use lift cause they live in jiak hong chu. no smoke in lift problem. okay bo?,btohqsg
that one their own lift. they smoke their problem. dps wont complain.,btohqsg
and your assumption that anyone who stays mbs is automatically high ses shows what a clown you are kek,btohqsg
hi can bring me go mbs ma?,btohqsg
That's true. There's one in Singapore with private car lift. Imagine all the exhaust. It's like 10000 smokers all huff and puff at once.,btohqsg
Sat I go in buy again üòå,btohqsg
everytime jb. you can fight with dps liao,btohqsg
Diff. I go in buy cigg and eat . Metime.He go in eat with jbmm.,btohqsg
Wa eating at the grand canyon. You the real man here,btohqsg

Especially inside got the black glutinous rice. Shiok. Next time I ask for more,btohqsg

I ask them what is most common purchase,btohqsg

Nope is the red bean one,btohqsg
