Not really their preferred career path for me,btohqsg
Didn't u choose your degree also based on the ideal of not wasting your RP or was it someone else?,btohqsg
It is more of a waste if you end up unemployed or in a role which is related to your degree but does not exploit your full potential.,btohqsg
Tbh this is what Alot of older folks advice the younger ones  but being in that time of life is really makes a difference. She still at the point of life where most of her expenses are paid for by her parents,btohqsg
You ended up in your degree program by chance. Don't leave your future to chance.,btohqsg
You get a salary when you get a job. If that job isn't what they want it to be  you can pay for yourself.,btohqsg
"I work at a university  so I have a birds eye view of these things. The most successful graduates end up doing something that is not the ""typical"" career path expected of people from their program. By definition  if you have a ""typical"" career  you will end up being a forgettable ""typical"" person.",btohqsg
(I must stress  these opinions are my own  not of any other person or entity I am affiliated with),btohqsg
For most people they have to balance the fine line between actually not letting their parents down but also not letting themselves down.When your parents spend half their life savings to put you through a standard or path  it's very tough to ignore that factor and not give that more piriority over one's believes or aspirations.Unless the certainty of your believes or aspirations validates talent that one may already have,btohqsg
Well  parents need to have more realistic expectations. University takes time. 4 years is a long time for an industry to go from boom to bust. You can't expect to commit to a specific career 4 years in advance when the jobs may no longer be there when you graduate. Which is why many employers hire people without too much regard for their actual degree.,btohqsg
I need to learn how not to stick things to the book because if things go haywire like now  i dunno how to get out of it nd find other solutions,btohqsg
"Yeah that's your problem gotta stop with the ideal of the kiasu ""need to maximise everything I get"" kinda mentality",btohqsg
Yea and im at the stage where i need to seek advice but also knowing perhaps my parents may not be that useful in that sense coz 1) they are not pharma bg tho my mum works in pharma company 2) they hv a path right in front of then when they graduate coz they were psc scholars,btohqsg
If u do so can your really argue that u have free will and are an independent agent? Because that mentality leaves u basically at the whims of what the masses want.,btohqsg
Talk to your jc friends in courses like business. Seek their perspective. Also  consider what industries are the most promising in Singapore. Pharma is probably not one of them. But the most promising industries would probably hire a suitable candidate with a pharma degree  too.,btohqsg
You are not defined by your degree. If you really feel constrained by it  get a masters. But you don't have to.,btohqsg
Actually this is v true and things can change in a blink of an eye as well and perhaps like what u mentioned there is no such thing as â€˜fixed career pathâ€™,btohqsg
Yea and my mum told me it is as good as i did not graduate fr pharmacy sch if i dun get a pharmacy license  but omo if things goes rong  there is always a solution to it,btohqsg
Precisely. University is meant to broaden your perspective  improve the breadth of your knowledge but also the depth of your knowledge in your discipline. But at the end of the day  it should not be a blinker that commits you to an unsustainable career path  trudging along in a dead end job till you retire...,btohqsg
They have to but that does not mean they want to. So many parents tend to push their child to limits that are on the verge of using filial piety as a negotiating or bargaining tool and that basically results in the child not having any say.Like one of my friends right now  die die parents want him to go overseas uni. Will pay for all his expenses but I'm very sure he does not want it. Such a hard bargain  how to balance,btohqsg
Last I heard the majority of students who graduate from Law school didn't not end up getting called to the bar. So it really doesn't matter what major u did as it is just the conception of the subjects u learnt that culminates in the awarding of a degree.,btohqsg
Yea i dun even think there is a local pharma companyðŸ’€,btohqsg
honestly  parents' opinions should have no bearing on musician right now. they are graduated  and are more than capable of getting a job and paying their own bills  even without parents' support.,btohqsg
Lemme just say it this way from my perspective and logic. Because I did 2 years in RP doing my diploma in Biomedical Science but drop out for NTU meaning I don't get my Diploma. Does this mean I have learnt nothing or I wasted my 2 years?,btohqsg
That is pretty much most poly diplomas  if you don't advance to uni. Especially in the science field  you basically got a diploma that is diw,btohqsg
What they should consider is the following; what is the best move I can make right now for my career?,btohqsg
If pharma can be ruled out  musician should drop pharma like a hot potato,btohqsg
True but sounds like in the back of her mind  she still wants to somewhat value her parents wishes,btohqsg
My parents hv mentioned overseas uni many many times but i still chose to do it locally coz they did not give me any assurance that they will not leave me there alone and ya i miss familyðŸ’€,btohqsg
well  she shouldn't. it will be a bad decision. one that may end up pulling her apart from her parents when things don't go as planned,btohqsg
psc scholars have a very perculiar view of the world. At the age of 18 they are given a pamphlet which shows them exactly how they will progress in their career  the number of years of work that will get them emplaced at a certain job level  etc etc. Everything is planned out till retirement. Most people don't have that sort of certainty,btohqsg
Therefore  they are uniquely placed to give uniquely bad advice to musician,btohqsg
Welp as I said it's easy to say but many people take years to overcome this hurdle  the pressure and the knowledge that your very own parents could have spend 1/3 or even half their life savings on you to go down a path they alr planned out eats at you every single day,btohqsg
relax  they are psc scholars  op's nus degree is not gonna cost them half of life savings ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Amount spent is still rather large tbf,btohqsg
It is not really â€˜value my parents wishesâ€™. Tbh pharmacy was my choice back then (becoz of what i mentioned previously of not wasting my rp)It is more of1) hving seen me suffered completing uni  my parents kinda want me to stay in pharma  in fact my mum told me not to give up tryna to get the license so easily (fyi i basically failed 6 interviews so idk why it is called â€˜give up easilyâ€™)2) if i want to branch out to other things  at this point im still tryna figure out where to go  what i want and whether they accept entry level in the first place (tbh i kinda am v unproductive when coming to things i dun really like doing such as interviews and job seeking coz it is damn mundane),btohqsg
Yes  but not enough to blind musician to alternative  possibly better career paths,btohqsg
Otherwise op would have fallen for the classic sunk cost fallacy,btohqsg
Maybe that is why my parents hv been lucky  instead of them finding for jobs  the jobs find them,btohqsg
Yes. But that also means you should take their advice with a grain of salt,btohqsg
Nah if she had  she won't be thinking of her life right now fr,btohqsg
Tbh for a typical degree  aft moeâ€™s subsidy of 0%  it is still not that bad,btohqsg
40k a sem? Is it can't rmb,btohqsg
Where got. More like 40k for all 4 years  including hall,btohqsg
Oh maybe I thinking priv lol,btohqsg
No after subsidy mine is $9k per yr,btohqsg
Yeah  so it's not even that big of a sunk cost.,btohqsg
40k i can go australia international rateðŸ’€,btohqsg
3k per yr more than poly,btohqsg
40k per sem is probably close to ivy league rates,btohqsg
