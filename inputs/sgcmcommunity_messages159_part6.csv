Suggest u leave it there wait till the next servicing then patch it,btohqsg
Try if buffing it out works,btohqsg

Buff out the surface dirty first.I recommend those density sponge.Then apply paint correction if you wanna DIY.,btohqsg

Lower CG better mah .. ü§£,btohqsg
Give it a bit of a wash  then buff it out. Most of it should come off  whatever that's left  unfortunately you're going to need to paint. Most paint shops probably charge less than 80 for this....but make sure you go to one that won't turn your car into a colour palette.,btohqsg
Ok but Got a slight dent too. Wonder those dent plunger can pull it back,btohqsg
Yeah find a PDR and you should be good.,btohqsg
