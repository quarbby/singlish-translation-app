my cousin didnt take lit in sec school coz no offer  then jc came to take h2 + h3 lit,btohqsg
If U force the geog + hist combi kids from sec sch,btohqsg
yea lit not much content  but rather on technique,btohqsg
I feel like sci is like,btohqsg
They use some o lvl shit,btohqsg
but 6 books in 2y is crazy,btohqsg
That's y got the pre req,btohqsg
i cant even handle 1 book in 2y,btohqsg
But ofc I only can speak for my subj la,btohqsg
ofc not brobut i wld expect it to like vary from the different posts i see from that subredditBUT NOPE3 POSTS AND THEY ALL ARE THE SAME TOPIC,btohqsg
The only thing semi useful from o lvl geog to H1 is,btohqsg
tbh i should hv taken geog as my elect,btohqsg
But the skills I learnt from,btohqsg
Kinda carried over to A lvl,btohqsg
it is easier to jump grades and do miracle than lit,btohqsg
It's why I decided fuck lit in lower sec,btohqsg
i came across a post that more sec sch should offer econs at sec sch...but then as someone who took econs in sec and H2 econs in jc  i can say content wise much easier to understand but the answering technique is different,btohqsg
Ways to test also and all,btohqsg
Tbh the main jump for geog for me was essay tho,btohqsg
The way essay done at Os damn diff from As,btohqsg
does content overlap between os and as,btohqsg
cause i think the answering technique is diff,btohqsg
New sylla I think will have more overlap,btohqsg
tbh for history the jump is mostly in terms of the answering skills not content  at least for paper 1,btohqsg
ah ic  just curious why doing the subj in Os is not a pre-req unlike sciences,btohqsg
chem no question coz chem is compulsory in Os,btohqsg
I heard some schs got phys bio one,btohqsg
i tot it was compulsory all this while:-(,btohqsg
I mean tbh theres a reason why sch want u to take chem,btohqsg
Because alot of poly course and h2 chem need O level chem,btohqsg
But afaik  is not compulsory like english is,btohqsg
omg all these while i thought chem was compulsory,btohqsg
but i mean i would hv taken chem regardless,btohqsg
I mean it kinda is for the absolute majority of people la,btohqsg
i nearly took combine sci chem / phy but my school didnt offer,btohqsg
but tbh it is a blessing in disguise,btohqsg
coz i would have died doing phy at As,btohqsg
I wanted bio and hist so bad,btohqsg
I suck thumb and take geog,btohqsg
Then end up I love geog alot now,btohqsg
THIS IS ACTUALLY RACISM AT IT'S FINEST,btohqsg
tbh i would have scored higher for l1r5 if econs did not exist in my school,btohqsg
coz i was doing pretty bad for all 3 humans in sec 2,btohqsg
so took gamble and try econs lmao,btohqsg
wtf o level econs? so rare lol,btohqsg
the downside to it is that combine humans becomes ur compulsory added humans,btohqsg
and i was equally bad in ss + lit lmao,btohqsg
then my mum was like 'see u never listen  i ask u take geog',btohqsg
Wait so they have an advantage in H2 econs?,btohqsg
Content wise yes they understand btr,btohqsg
