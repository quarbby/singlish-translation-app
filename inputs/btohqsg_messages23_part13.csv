You're 1st timer or 2nd timer?Cause no matter the overall subscription rate  must see 1st timer and 2nd timer rates. Cause 2nd timer they cap at 5% of available units  so if 2nd timer oversubscribed  then not guaranteed to get a number / choose a flat,btohqsg
Oki then 95% set aside for 1st timers,btohqsg
Anyone know if you are allowed to apply for a flat past estimated max loan?,btohqsg
Yes if you are confident that you have sufficient cash to pay off the remaining,btohqsg
Can PLH use the scheme of within 4km radius near parents?,btohqsg
Please go to reno groups . Unrelated here,btohqsg
I think yesBoth PLH and 4km scheme are 2 different schemesPLH MOP 10 years you can't move out of the flat4km scheme MOP 5 Years for the old parents can't move away from you more than 4km vice versaBest call and write into HDB for correct answer,btohqsg
If going for both schemes best ask HDB for the correct MOP years,btohqsg
Actually I quite curious. Let‚Äôs say  after 10 years we sell off the unit. We got to pay back 9% of the flat selling.The selling price  does it include grant loaned from HDB or excluded?,btohqsg
Based on 9% of selling price or market valuation  whichever is higher,btohqsg
Not sureClaw back are comfirm it's in the news what is the % not sureDid hear about having Grant return as well just don't remember from where and whyAfter selling of flat there are CPF OA + accrued interest return as well,btohqsg
anyone noe about the quota setted by HDB for PLH flats?https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/news-and-publications/press-releases/HDB-Launches-6938-Flats-in-June-2024-BTO-Exercise#FN2,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt cancel my current BTO application . There is no direct cancellation option . As I m changing to apply another estate .. thanks,btohqsg
So I just do another new application and the system will give me the option to cancel ??,btohqsg
If remember correctly PLH are based on the projectMean all flat in a project itself are PLHQuota are set onFirst timerSecond timerSeniorSinglethe racesCurrent status you applying BTO are on theEstatesand flat typesOnly when you got a Q number than see luck if you able to select a flat in the project you wantOn your first appointment than the PLH come in,btohqsg
You can see there are multiple projects in the same estate,btohqsg
Those are Oct 24 BTO you can see there are 32 room project in bedokIf you have Q number you get to select from those 3 project when it's your turn,btohqsg
hi all  anyone has issue on the portal  im unable to apply for the 3-room for Teban location. Is it due to income ceiling?,btohqsg
no worries  found out its due to the income ceiling,btohqsg
Will they show tables like these throughout the application period? or only after?,btohqsg

Hi  is public scheme correct for application scheme if I‚Äôm applying as fianc√©/ fianc√©e?,btohqsg
i would hope so  as mine was the same. there wasnt any option for fianc√©/fianc√©e priority scheme,btohqsg

saw somewhere that applicants for this june bto who are given a number even if it is out of supply eg 250/200 will be considered 2nd timer if they apply for oct bto without first waiting for the call ups to be done. does this apply to the feb bto? or is this a new game mechanic only implemented in june bto?,btohqsg
does this mean that applicant can only apply for alternate btos? ie skip one and apply for the next,btohqsg
Heard if they are unsuccessful in their selection still first timer if they choose to apply for the next consecutive ones. Only if they cancel/pass/no show their for their selection then they‚Äôll be considered second timer in the next consecutive projects.,btohqsg
so people who bid for june and got a number even if out of supply can still bid for oct? will the call up if any happen before oct's call up?,btohqsg
After HFE  can I still apply for additional grants?,btohqsg
Anybody went down to hdb hub to see the bto models?,btohqsg
How the allocation for second timer MCPS  works ?,btohqsg
YesIf your Jun application Q number is way back behind the supply u still can apply for Next Launch which is Oct.But  of course if u being call up for Jun to select a flat then u decide if u still wants to go for it or wait for Oct results. Because Oct results may not come out First!!!!So u take the risk la  if u kenna call up then u check the units available if not so good then u give up wait for Oct results.If u really in need of a house then whatever balance for Jun called up u take and give up Oct application,btohqsg
There are no models now. Only elderly folks who don't know how to apply online are allowed to enter HDB hub. HDB staff say to refer to online sites for more info.,btohqsg
Ok noted thanks for sharing !,btohqsg
But for every bto release   there are bto models that are released for public to view right ?,btohqsg
It seems like they'll only do that closer to flat selection.,btohqsg
Oh okok now I understand  thanks for sharing !,btohqsg
"For now HDB only print out the pages on the website. Then add a ""NO 3D MODELS AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING"" on the paper to give out to elderly folks who queue up to enter HDB.",btohqsg
There are 2 types. Outside ones are selected models for other areas. The ones inside are models for ongoing BTO selections. The ones inside are 3D models + floor type etc.,btohqsg
lol elderly go there to cui 3D models after the CCA showflats inside ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
If Feb BTO ask you to choose but you rejectedWill become second timerAnd all other application (even queue 1) will be cancelled,btohqsg
So the inside ones need to hve Hdb appt before can view ?,btohqsg
YES! as in HDB appointment for house selection  sign lease + collect keys & resale completion only.,btohqsg
But resale completion is at L2 but still can access to take selfie holding keys lolll,btohqsg
Ok now I understand. So if I go Hdb hub now nth to view ?,btohqsg
Hi there  can I check if we will receive any notification to confirm that we have cancelled our application if we cancelled during sales launch?,btohqsg
Can just peep from outside only.,btohqsg
You are referring to this kind of glass model right ?,btohqsg
But I'm curious why you wanna see the 3D models inside? Because to my understanding those models apply for those selecting the flat. Last March when I was there  they only showcase Tengah  Chai Chee  Bedok South and couple other models. Definitely not for the upcoming ones. Even brochure also HDB yet to produce lo.,btohqsg
