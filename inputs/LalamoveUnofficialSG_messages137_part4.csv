N need luck to have the job appear n u win bid,btohqsg
Sure if u take all sorts of jobs at any prices maybe u can use quantity to hit the 300 u all talking abt,btohqsg
Long distance  long hrs  high costs,btohqsg
I the type maybe I spend 6-8 hrs outside,btohqsg
But I don't drive all the way,btohqsg
From 4+ until 730 I no do any job cos no job worth doing ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
