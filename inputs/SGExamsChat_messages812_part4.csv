P.s. I have not graduated yet,btohqsg
Then just do PDGE and get bonded first,btohqsg
yea... was previously 1st class and then dropped to 2nd upper due to prof nelly,btohqsg
Was previously 2nd lower but drop to no more class because of ps2,btohqsg
I dropped cuz apparently not a good idea to do a 4k mod in Y1,btohqsg
meanwhile in spms  year 1 mods are taught in year 2 :D,btohqsg
I cant even run 1km in 15 mins,btohqsg
I get a heart attack if I run 1km,btohqsg
Every action also has an equal and opposite reaction,btohqsg
but newton also said that those with mass are unstoppableeeee cus of inertia,btohqsg
Yeah but newton didnt discover that my mass is so huge people orbit me,btohqsg
Well Newton's Theory of Inertia was different from our current understanding of Inertia,btohqsg
I will fall down before the 1km mark if i continue to run,btohqsg
Fall down 7 times get up 8,btohqsg
i wonder if it is possible to work in moe without working as a teacher,btohqsg
Back then the word Inertia I think it was coined by Decartes was in relation to planetary motions in orbits,btohqsg
Research is not MOE is NIE,btohqsg
i will roll on the track,btohqsg
I had motivation to go to activesg treadmill,btohqsg
The stop button is there in the fucking middle in bright red,btohqsg
But they renovating my nearest gym for the next 7 years,btohqsg
I have the motivation to run on the treadmill and once I reach the panel I press the stop button,btohqsg
Guess we are destined to remain large size,btohqsg
Except youre tall and im not,btohqsg
I am not large I am big boned!,btohqsg
Id imagine everyone here is taller than me,btohqsg
But it's a lot better and more credible if u actually have some teaching experience,btohqsg
Haiz sometimes i wish maybe i shouldve pursued an arts degree for a more easier transition to pdge,btohqsg
At least from what im hearing current teachers tell me now  moe aint looking for stem teachers,btohqsg
Cuz yall like money what then do STEM,btohqsg
The only person doing arts stuff is the siaolangs like me,btohqsg
As any normie  i too would like to go pdge after this degree,btohqsg
But my gpa is missing a +1 before i can even consider NIE lmao,btohqsg
wah now spain 3-0 croatia at half time,btohqsg
I need to catch up with you,btohqsg
So I don't think I would give a shit about FCH,btohqsg
Wait till you hear about my 6 year candidature plan,btohqsg
but tbh i feel like the science side quite lacking also,btohqsg
Wait till u hear about my 2.5 year candidature plan,btohqsg
is just that i feel like most of them end up in math,btohqsg
Yall STEM ppl they chun out a lot,btohqsg
The supply of grads is high enough from local unis,btohqsg
i have heard of someone trying to apply as a math teacher for moe scholarship,btohqsg
they put him as Math + ss teacher,btohqsg
he say dont want  end up rejected,btohqsg
Damn if i had to teach ss,btohqsg
Reminds me of my primary school Chinese teacher,btohqsg
I would just churn out model essays for kids to remember,btohqsg
He did PE + Chinese cuz he didn't hit the English requirements for admission,btohqsg
at least now ss introduce gloabalisation as a toopic,btohqsg
