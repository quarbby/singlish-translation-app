My Monthly spend likeGroceries - 200$Utilities Bill- 350$Bus MRT - 100$Other Shopping- 100$,btohqsg
Anyone knows if amex got email approval for applying their cc? Just applied ytd but no response yet,btohqsg
If those are guaranteed spends  then you can spend another $250 per month for the $1000 tier.Groceries only buy from Giant/CS or any other DFG.,btohqsg
Means can only wait for physical card to arrive if have,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt matter. Have email or not. Also must wait physical card arrive.,btohqsg
Not easy to reach to minimum spending then. Really hard to reach,btohqsg
OCBC infinity lor. $8 cashback with $500 spend,btohqsg
Hi got a question on uob one card If I buy items on shopee via shopback using uob one card  do I get the additional cashback bonus??,btohqsg
Yes if u hit at least the 500 monthly for the quarter,btohqsg
I tried searching but i cldn‚Äôt find,btohqsg
The problem is what answer u expect?It‚Äôs like askingGst allowance is $500 per paxCan I bring in $800 worth of goods?,btohqsg
Is not an answer am expecting and have thought about it before. These are loopholes that peeps are exploiting. The fact that a bank‚Äôs system allows such  it is flawed for a start. Like everyone else  hopefully and probably seemingly impossible to claw back.,btohqsg
But you think the bank doesn‚Äôt know meh? If it‚Äôs really a loophole  banks will be the first one to deny it. Like OCBC knows whether the salary credit is from a giro. Surely UOB knows the fund is from yourself,btohqsg
Any idea how to use amex cards to pay for income tax to clock spending requirements?,btohqsg
So while a loophole is still around  lets enjoy it while it last. If one day  the bank close it  it is their right to do it.,btohqsg
I'm trying to hit the 10% total cashback. So if I spend 2k on shopee VIA shopback will get 10%?,btohqsg
Due to the cap u get effective 8.333,btohqsg
I diverted from the initial question üòÇ,btohqsg
yes u are paying shopee  just clicking through shopback. Get bonus rebate if u meet $2k spend and min 5 transactions in all 3 statement months of your qualifying quarter. Note that the 6.66% bonus rate is capped at $100 per month.,btohqsg
Tried a few times confirmed Alipay and wechat cant work for Singaporeans in Singapore. Cant think of a payment method to pay for coffeeshop food/drinks with credit cards,btohqsg
Economic PLUNGE: Consumers Are TANKING  Treasury Borrowing Erupts  Yen Collapse Zero Hopehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP1wXr-KzlMUS will never stop borrowing. Ever. Period. .... lie after lies from USA !!!,btohqsg
While Mari savings has a limit of $100k  Mari invest seems to have no upper limit.,btohqsg
Might be a good option for almost no frills above $100k.,btohqsg
i bought Quayside JBCC  do you mind connecting to discuss ?,btohqsg
Hi after hitting the 15 300 cap on srs in Feb  I‚Äôve received some dividend payments in my srs bank account.What can I do with it?Can I still use it to buy more stocks/etf even if I‚Äôve hit my annual capOr am I forced to just hold the cash in the srs account until the cap refreshes in Jan 2025 and bear with the 0.05% interest?,btohqsg
Might have to consider getting a dcs/ amex card then and have them as a new niche card. ‚Äúhawker card‚Äù,btohqsg
Anyone got experience if i apply for Citi rewards card via singsaver online will the annual fee be waived ?,btohqsg
The 15 300 contribution cap only restricts how much you can put into SRS.Whatever proceeds you receive as a result of dividends or disposal of shares  those may be immediately put to work by purchasing SRS eligible products. No need to wait till Jan 2025,btohqsg
"Hi all  for Everyday rewards programme (HSBC EGA)  specifically the bonus 1%the tncs states ""Maximum amount Bonus Interest that can be earned"" = $300That 'maximum bonus interest' only counts the 1% bonus interest from everyday rewards program and not the 3.35%'s ""HSBC Everyday Global Account Bonus Interest Promotion"" right?i.e. soft cap is $300/1%*12months = ~$360k to earn the optimal 4.35%?0.05% base + 1% everyday rewards + 3.30% bonus interest promotion",btohqsg
Hi. Anyone can advise if would I be earning more if I used Cardup for:1) use UOB PRVI MasterCard (1.4mpd) + 2.6% feeOr2) DBS altitude visa (1.3mpd) + 1.85% fee?I don't have the PRVI visa at the moment,btohqsg
Is your question targeting whether the bank will give u the recognition benefit?OrAre u worried u will owe Singapore government income tax?Your question is phrased more to ask about the latter and my answer is addressing as such.Sis trazora has already answered if former.,btohqsg
Not to be confused with a savings account  Mari Invest is an investment product and still carries a risk albeit low. Not forgetting when Jul comes  the management charges goes back to 0.25% p.a.,btohqsg
Just need for one blowup before Mas will come reminding everyone that:Managed accounts / funds are not the same as bank savings account.,btohqsg
Just like I don‚Äôt understand why investors don‚Äôt seem to demand a risk premium for trading / custodising assets with weaker brokers.Maybe they never heard of mf global.,btohqsg
The cap is on your annual contributions and should be reinvesting the dividends.,btohqsg
Yes. Depending on how many days in that month  you should adjust accordingly based on the $300 1% cashback cap.,btohqsg
Your own screenshot already gave you the answer.,btohqsg
There's a useful tool called CardUp rewards calculator  you should check it out.,btohqsg
Taiwan surprised me again. Last time restaurant in mall mcc 5311. And now food store in airport has mcc 7991 üòÑ.,btohqsg
Taiwan and Korea and Japan all have monkey MCCs.Safest to use Uob visa signature.Else if want to use amaze + master. Get used to using amaze + empty wallet method  ready to switch cards after first decline.,btohqsg
Are we still able to get around 4% interest from the HSBC savings account  or they have nerfed it again?,btohqsg
With the nerf on UOB Absolute AMEX on learning institutions  will the next best card be using AMEX TrueCashBack for 1.5%?,btohqsg
Have already gotten the answer yesterday. Thanks,btohqsg
Does this clause means my salary contribution for deduction for ESPP purchase  company do not have to pay the 17% CPF contribution ?,btohqsg
