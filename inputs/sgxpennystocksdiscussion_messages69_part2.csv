Ya.... I was following your chart confidently üëç...if not for today's MT....,btohqsg
Then that is okay for you....little damage done....,btohqsg
Hmmm  I‚Äôm Still feeling optimistic. Feels to me that this MT flush is to weed the weak hands .Might be a chance to scoop up some counters on the cheap.(Do watch MT closely for indication  before scooping up too  just to be in the safer side),btohqsg
Bro our ahc. So sad  washed by mt,btohqsg
I sold of mine on Monday  with some profit. I don‚Äôt want to experience the lousy feelings of seeing it plunge. Couple of month back  it happens. It affect me quite a bit.,btohqsg
I think put in freezer again,btohqsg
Yea  it was stabilising. Then after one meeting  suddenly everything changed.How many you bought and at,btohqsg
Not only your ahc  all counters also affected by the decimation of MT...üò™,btohqsg
Averaged down but the freezer space just got bigger,btohqsg
Thanks for this much needed comment üí™üí™,btohqsg
I just want to take this opportunity to thank you for all your charts of MT. Pl don‚Äôt feel bad at all. the stock mkt is very unpredictable and a big ocean of all kinds of entities. Put today‚Äôs episode behind u please.,btohqsg
it is incredible that mt affect the market,btohqsg
Wa...lucky you.This is the 1st time I see MT's price drop like that!! I read got other times also but I was not engaged in this counter.,btohqsg
lol his chart make me exit my position at 155. gotta say nice one buddy thanks,btohqsg
Hope MT can do a quick rebound to bring back sentiments.Fundamentals wise  MT profits and all do justify its price or a higher one. But when all retailers come in to chase. High chance this type of flush happens.Take TG for example. I believe the same repeats.,btohqsg
That also shows how powerful your charting is  master yuan üëç,btohqsg
I learn alot from your charts üôè Tq,btohqsg
Sentiments exact so hope it‚Äôs just a temporary scare,btohqsg
Well  if you are invested it a different ball game.,btohqsg
hopefully bro but looking at medtec history nv just 1 day big red candle at least 2 big red candle everytime,btohqsg
yeah only goes to show MT is a mkt leader,btohqsg
tmr shld be dead cat bounce to 142-146 den after lunch will slam down all the way to 122-128,btohqsg
Nope...am not vested in MT.... newbie here and trying to learn from fellow investors. Today is a real eye-opener,btohqsg
but if open big gap down den gd is time to buy in becos everyone will start throwing an panic,btohqsg
