The markers confirm also laugh while reading my written script,btohqsg

I somehow managed to talk to my neighbour in chi somewhat,btohqsg
idk how to finish p2 lol. 1h 30m but compre need write until so long,btohqsg
coz the whole class complain to the cher about the examiner...like was a straight face at us throughout (i forgot the word to describe it),btohqsg
so last 10 min i always jump to summary cos summary more free marks,btohqsg
this actually reminds me of once i wrote 4 lines (+ handwriting like ant) for a chem 1m qns,btohqsg
coz i dunno what is enough  so i just write everything,btohqsg
it is humans that is really hard to finish,btohqsg

i cant remember how i got number 5 in cohort in mbt,btohqsg
lol same. but u know why? cos they remove 8m due to clt,btohqsg
when i got D in promos,btohqsg
"""val is the reason why people fail promos""- a wise person",btohqsg
if they never remove 8m idk if i would have gotten A lol,btohqsg
u mean they removed the 8m qns in csq,btohqsg
2020 & 2021 got common last topic (clt)  cause of covid so they remove clt qns,btohqsg
but the 8m is in csq right,btohqsg

if the cohort do really badly  they will moderate all grades,btohqsg
you're the reason why tmjc is still relevant,btohqsg

I rmb only D-E get modded,btohqsg
