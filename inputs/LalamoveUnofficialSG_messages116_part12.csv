Have you cancelled any orders recently?,btohqsg
That can be the reason why.. if you cancel they wouldn't give chance... unless really valid reason..,btohqsg
I tot need to call in to cancel,btohqsg
Ya you call in will kana If not valid,btohqsg
Why the driver hotline like shit,btohqsg
Call customer to cancel  but if FNB job  u call them they also cannot do anything,btohqsg
Anykne knows riding motorcycle on footpath fine kana how much?,btohqsg
At Forum. They hang ard near the traffic junction. Suey2 kana today.. Cibei..,btohqsg
So they stop u and take your particular is it?,btohqsg
Yup. Kana stop while abt to reverse my bike.. Sian,btohqsg
I parking only they saw me then call me chow   nothing happened,btohqsg
Thats y. I also want to chiao when they call. My bike cannot start. Kanasai..,btohqsg
up to $2000  and/or 3 months jail for motorbike on footpath.,btohqsg
^ actually i dont know if this is for town only  seems too high. my last pavement parking fine was $70  about 2 years ago.,btohqsg
but who'd ever get 3 months jail lol,btohqsg
i can see jail happening if someone gets burned on a hot exhaust or if the bike topples on a kid  or something like that.,btohqsg
damn  toppling on a kid haha,btohqsg
must be the kid go and topple it on himself 😂,btohqsg
According to the document parking at pavement got demerit points so as a 12 point p plate I don’t park pavement at all. I’ll risk double yellow which is supposedly a $250 fine but no points or jail,btohqsg
If not I’ll just park in HDB nearby even if I lose time,btohqsg
I hate the most is Waterway Point. No place to even illegally park. Wanna legally park have to join the long queue,btohqsg
Waterway point is the worse place to collect orders..,btohqsg
Yeah.. good for ebike cus they can park anyhow. Motorcycle very restricted,btohqsg
Ya.. but enforcement for ebikes also extremely strict 😪,btohqsg
Haha real pity cus there a lot of orders,btohqsg
Got alot uh? I always check nothing one.. for llm,btohqsg
Unless you trying to say grabfood all those then ah I understand,btohqsg
For foodpanda can have quite a bit,btohqsg
Yeh i do panda sometimes. Cus panda very inflexible. Must book shift and this is a part time I cannot always commit to the shift,btohqsg
True  but I hate their system tbh,btohqsg
But panda earns more than llm cus of the short distance,btohqsg
That's why I'm thinking of getting lalabag for district orders,btohqsg
I ownself have their thermal bag,btohqsg
Cus deliveroo dun wanna accept my application also... say too many riders,btohqsg
Too many riders they want pause first,btohqsg
How's the district filters  actually shorter distance?,btohqsg
Hmm  depends on how you look at it,btohqsg
Not like Amazon open flood gate n lower price pol,btohqsg
Is less of the bag but more of unlocking the district filter for me,btohqsg
Even though deliveroo is a small company,btohqsg
For me not really 😂 barely fits medium orders,btohqsg
Their distance is like from raffles to orchard,btohqsg
If you are super lucky  just opposite pickup point,btohqsg
I mean benefits lol I dun care ABT keeping food warm 🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
I do care 😂 perfect service HAHAHA,btohqsg
