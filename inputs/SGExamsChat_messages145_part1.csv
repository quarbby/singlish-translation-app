Prepare to pack some revision materials to do in class because it's so boring,btohqsg
Ya 😓 actually whats the pointSince it’s not gonna be a lot higher standard than o level,btohqsg
h1 chi is a bit tougher,btohqsg
I wish this area of genius can be exchanged for other area of genius,btohqsg
Whats so great about getting A for a h1 chinese compared to so many other things🤣,btohqsg
For me  I was the first in my class alphabetically. So somehow I did the oral exam one day before the rest of my class and as I have said here before the question was horrendous. About something I don't even know  the sports hub...Otherwise it would be an easy A.,btohqsg
is touching and cutting the axis,btohqsg
But I don't understand why Singaporeans read % as 巴仙 not 百分之,btohqsg
NO! Touching is tangent  at one intersection point. Cutting is 2 intersection points,btohqsg
Let's do 线性代数 in Chinese... Hahaha,btohqsg
Is just like how ppl say they go atm 按钱  when in reality is 提钱,btohqsg
and when ppl say 还钱 when they're making payment instead of 付钱 🥴🥴,btohqsg
I call it 提款 or 提现,btohqsg
Yes  it's like I borrowed money...,btohqsg
First time I was taken aback  like I borrowed money and the debt collector is demanding from me,btohqsg
SG Chinese language cannot compare to mainland,btohqsg
My Chinese is horrendous now  I haven't spoke it for so long,btohqsg
Not sure if Singaporeans know mathematics in Chinese:n次方 - power of n线性相关 - Linear Dependent函数 - function单射 - injective满射 - surjective双射 - bijective群论- group theory数论 - number theory几何学 - geometryetc etc,btohqsg
You must be reading too much Chinese internet stuff with that in it...,btohqsg
Otherwise where did you learn swear words?,btohqsg
The names for injective surjective and bijective make a lot of sense,btohqsg
indices in chinese is what ah,btohqsg
Wow  okay... I thought it would be more hokkien and cantonese swear words,btohqsg
but i think ur chi standards prob q good,btohqsg
i only know 加减成 and division idk,btohqsg
i cant believe my chi standards dropped so much,btohqsg
last time my cher taught so well she got me to an A1,btohqsg
hahahah which year did u get ur A1?,btohqsg
makes jokes most of the time in class,btohqsg
i think shes the vv minority chi teachers that makes jokes i think,btohqsg
i havent seen any chi tchr like her,btohqsg
most of the others are like just talking all the way,btohqsg
Oh  and in chinese  fractions are read the other way. E.g. 7/12 is read as 12分之7,btohqsg
the square root with the 3 beside  is it 根号3？,btohqsg
No  that's square root of 3,btohqsg
Like when we say squared  it is 平方,btohqsg
Nowadays they don't really publish mathematics papers in Chinese  it's basically all in English,btohqsg
r u frm hci or rv,btohqsg
Curious if people here know the financial characters of numbers  also known as 大写：零壹贰叁肆伍陆柒捌玖拾佰仟,btohqsg
For example  if you want to write on a cheque or receipt of 56.10 dollars  you write 伍拾陆圆壹角,btohqsg
Heyy i am expert in organic chemistry.i can teach you,btohqsg
So how did u manage? Given me i also will stun like wad question is thatAnyway i self doubted alot too cos i think i didnt know exactly what was expected from the oral examiner,btohqsg
I essentially did very badly. All I said was I went to the sports hub to play basketball with my friends over the weekend? And I don't know what better to say or what else. They instantly could tell I have never been there  they asked me if that was the case  so they essentially led the conversation  asked me to calm down and drink water. I have never been to the sports hub and I don't know what is there to offer.The written parts helped me significantly but the oral still pulled it down. What can I do?,btohqsg
I don't know how to lie...,btohqsg
And I can discuss a lot of things but when it comes to sports  I am speechless and I don't know what to say.,btohqsg
I lie a lot during in school oral but somehow I have relevant experience for a national exam oral lol have never lied in any so far.,btohqsg
told them we shouldn't rent stuff because my cca junior rented a bike and there was a lose screw,btohqsg
then he felt and broke his wrist and the bone could be seen,btohqsg
then his leg everywhere got blood,btohqsg
I can't even use English to converse about the sports hub,btohqsg
