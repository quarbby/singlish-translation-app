they say my exhaust is illegal at jb..but i got cert for it,btohqsg
N55 has higher potential then n54 tho and more reliable,btohqsg
Some parts like con rod etc is forged the rest identically similar,btohqsg
But ofcos diff from 535 cause it‚Äôs heavy,btohqsg
the m2 engine got like 50+ horses more frm factoryü•≤,btohqsg
Cause it‚Äôs m tuned urs is not that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs the  diff,btohqsg
Huh? Loll... They gave u saman for that?,btohqsg
Wah I like Kaling Loh‚Äôs FDR2 sia. I just saw her IG post and she did a drift!,btohqsg
even if both on bm3 stage 2  the m2 makes more power bc of the reinforced pistons etc,btohqsg
U can forged n55 but m2 is faster cause it‚Äôs dct not zf that‚Äôs the big diff,btohqsg
535 is pneumatic wastegate  m2 is electronic,btohqsg
the ewg version makes 20-30 hp more than the pwg,btohqsg
Facelifted 135/235 electric Westgate too üòÖ,btohqsg
ya sia  i first time heard,btohqsg
But we talking about n54 v n55 ma not n55 v n55,btohqsg
haha depends on the versions lor,btohqsg
but n54 gt more things to change,btohqsg
i think bc n54 can handle higher boost levels bc of the forged internals ba,btohqsg
Not sure about holding boost but most n54 are too heavy,btohqsg
n54 can hold till 600+ i think,btohqsg
first time see vios so tiong,btohqsg
