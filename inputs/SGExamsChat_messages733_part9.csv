To each their own. But if ppl do not know what is best for themselves  govt may need to intervene,btohqsg
It can either be forcefully or nudging them,btohqsg
But it can change  with more information available and with changing expectations. During my era  it was radical for someone with L1R5 < 10 to want to go to a poly. My classmate had L1R5 < 10 and went Nursing and we frankly thought she gonecrazywoke,btohqsg
YI is there ok i mean there is a portion of ppl who are forced to go there by their parents  but it is also a hope for some others who screwd up their Os,btohqsg
Like for the diabetes issue  we try to nudge ppl away from consuming sweet drinks through all these campaigns as well as making use of salience bias by assigning grades to drinks. We don’t force ppl to limit their sugar intake,btohqsg
It is the parent’s responsibility to do what they want for their children. How does govt intervene on that,btohqsg
YIJC atmosphere needs to be change,btohqsg
Yeah it’ll take time. We’ll just have to see I guess. I’m not sure how moe came up with the number 20 as the requirement to enter JC a long time ago  but at least with the data we know  students in MI perform better than YI,btohqsg
I actually admire those who are really passionate about it,btohqsg
20 could also have been an arbitrary number set a long time ago when not much data was available on the performance of the students. But moe did not tighten the requirements even if the data suggests it would be overall of benefit to do so  for fear of backlash.,btohqsg
So if it’s past time to do it  just do it imo,btohqsg
They might have decided based on comparison with other countries  especially those whose population take O level as well  and countries that are seen as direct labour competition  as well as have had input from consultants,btohqsg
If im the Govt I will just leave it to market forces but perhaps ensure YI still get sufficient resources and good leadership,btohqsg
That classmate of mine is doing really really well right now. If you join CGH  you may get to hear her name haha,btohqsg
But i honestly dun think it will do any good by removing yi or lowering the 20,btohqsg
Yeah  since we do not have much historical data on the performance of local students. But now that we can refer to our own data  we can make decisions that are more informed,btohqsg
I see. At least I think one thing we can all agree on is that de Silva needs to go,btohqsg
After the introduction of IP  there was also suspicion that raw L1R5 = 6 may not be as “6” as before,btohqsg
Wdym? Like it’s less prestigious/ easier to achieve given that the pool of students who did the best in psle are no longer competing with others during the o level exams?,btohqsg
Guys jn my math teacher said the most illegal thing ever,btohqsg
Not less prestigious but may be easier to achieve given the cohort make-upBut it was also hard to conclude because of changing syllabus and focus of questions have shifted at the same time,btohqsg
No one I knew actually did a thorough comparison and investigation but that was definitely what some people “observed” and “felt”,btohqsg
Not surprising if that’s true anyway. But also up till now we don’t know whether in deciding grade boundaries  moe takes on a similar approach to the uk GCSE whereby they don’t factor in the cohort’s performance and just the paper’s difficulty,btohqsg
In other words the grade boundaries are decided before marking the paper so the number of students getting a particular grade is irrespective of other’s performance,btohqsg
"ok so she wanted us to raise hand then she said ""heil hitler""",btohqsg
Also jn during handball i was goalkeeper and i blocked 2 goals out of like 6 💀,btohqsg
"She was like""guys do the heil hitler pose""",btohqsg
Maybe i am the special needs,btohqsg
I love Biology and I want to stretch myself. I want to expand my Biology knowledge and play with viruses so I can make more Biology songs and poems. And most of all  I want to use these bacteria to make movies and music or just for the fun of it and to inspire other girls to love biology. The gender gap in STEM is disproportionately skewed towards guys so I want to shine that light and open the door for girls and women everywhere,btohqsg
Draw a book out with relation to O lvl Biology,btohqsg
You not having recess now ?,btohqsg
You may find this website interesting:https://www.lostwomenofscience.org/?mibextid=Zxz2cZ,btohqsg
btw that was a modified copypasta,btohqsg
Is de silva the name of the principal or a made up name,btohqsg
I remembered my math teacher telling the class A levels is probably the toughest 2y of ur life and here im suffering more,btohqsg
A levels is the toughest 2y of study life.,btohqsg
Spoiler alert: tougher years are ahead,btohqsg
Guess who is going to sleep in class,btohqsg
this is called taking care of yourself so that you are able to fight the battle,btohqsg
He kind of looks like he’s on drugs lol,btohqsg
or he looks he did not sleep well,btohqsg
@chemcerI took LD on the wrong day sia,btohqsg
the string of numbers has a meaning,btohqsg
I saw that Kurt tay vid of him with his toy,btohqsg
