the pes fit dont really like the pes c people ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
because during water parade  the pes C sit on the floor and if they mess up  they dont kena punished but the pes fit A/B1 kena punished,btohqsg

"this is true because their PT is for ""maintain fitness"" purpose",btohqsg
it's funny how during PT can do push ups but punishment cannot do push ups,btohqsg
pes c casually do 20 pull ups ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg

ironically trying to study for cc7 for the stupid individual quiz,btohqsg

Hi everyone I'm q curiousDid any J2/J1 here actually subscribe for sugaresque teaching,btohqsg
i heard someone say its useless,btohqsg
and she j talks about her day in class,btohqsg
i swear it was someone in this chat,btohqsg
she has my respect the same way brad goh does,btohqsg
love her or hate her u driving her engagement,btohqsg
and i got reason to believe brad goh might be doing it satirically or at least self aware of his image,btohqsg
I kinda just wanna figure out her business model,btohqsg
have a cultlike following of secondary sch girls and j1/j2 girls idolising u,btohqsg
and after u finish jc u realise shes not all that cracked up to be,btohqsg
i mean yea shes smart as hell but she sensationalises her life so much,btohqsg
to some extent most of us (jc kids) experience her life albeit less intensely,btohqsg
so the things she posts start looking a bit tryhard and fluff,btohqsg
and honestly i would take a leaf out of her book and be a tiktoker,btohqsg
but im objectively too ugly for that,btohqsg
study for 11 hrs a day (realistic),btohqsg

ok its my fault for even commenting in psq,btohqsg
its not uncommon for jc kids to mug 11 hrs a day,btohqsg
