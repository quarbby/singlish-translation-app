my ex from rj doesnt mean i let him off on things,btohqsg
why let people get away with shit just cuz they have good grades,btohqsg
I feel like thatâ€™s not a common attitude  but then I wouldnâ€™t know i suppose,btohqsg

Wah!! Why you let go of elite bf ley,btohqsg
dulwhich dont even wanna look at us sia,btohqsg
he needed to chiong his aâ€™s,btohqsg
just cuz someone has good income doesnt mean will treat u well will take care of u,btohqsg
felt like we not ready to be tgt or sum,btohqsg
He interested in other girls la. Guys are always like that.,btohqsg
Never knew that even though i was a hci+hcjc student,btohqsg
i only heard abt it during my sch internship,btohqsg
Ok. 95% of guys are like that. The other 5% are lying.,btohqsg
Iâ€™m just telling the truth about guys. The sooner girls accept this fact  the easier life will be. Donâ€™t be crying outside Tan Kah Kee MRT at 2am on New Years Day.,btohqsg
Fresh gradates and waiting for uni?,btohqsg
Guys think about other girls but doesnâ€™t mean they will cheat. Thatâ€™s the most important thing to take note,btohqsg
ive met genuinely great guys  and ive seen other genuinely great guys treat their girldriends like gold,btohqsg
guys always think abt othrr girls la,btohqsg
Oh man  you gonna be disappointed one day,btohqsg
im not even surprised if my future bf suddenly one day come and tell me he banged someone else,btohqsg
im older than u and been in the dating field way longer than u,btohqsg
damn thats why i dont like singaporeans,btohqsg
full of retarded flexes in weird ways,btohqsg
Bless  literally havent done anything in the dating field,btohqsg
be stopping the hoe life man,btohqsg
Why are you in the sgexams group?,btohqsg
Still following the struggles of JC/poly students?,btohqsg
Haha you confirm end up marrying a Sinkie one. Like super Sinkie guy. The type wear his Army singlet everywhere. And after go holiday in Thailand  come back with a lot of Red Bull & Singha beer singlet.,btohqsg
Im probably gonna lurk on the subreddit for years from now,btohqsg
no point rushing to date again,btohqsg
youll find the right one naturally,btohqsg
if i do find one  LMAOOO,btohqsg
Yea  cus they have a fever from COVID 19,btohqsg
yeah but my point is there exist many genuinely amazing loyal loving people of both genders,btohqsg
no such thing as all (insert gender) disloyal,btohqsg
I agree. But loyal guys do think of other girls,btohqsg
i wouldnt forbid my to think of other girls,btohqsg
but if they take action thats another story,btohqsg
Is looking and being friendly to other girls ok?,btohqsg
"It would be controlling imo if you're like  ""You're forbidden from thinking about other girls""",btohqsg
There are two types of people people who checks out other potential mates  and liars,btohqsg
Are these people single or taken?,btohqsg
It's a evolutionary instinct  as long as you don't act on that thought and cheat on your partner  it's fine,btohqsg
in this context  i assume it's people who are already taken,btohqsg
ive concluded that many boys are not ready to date or cmi long marriage relationships,btohqsg
Cuz if I'm with sometime  I'll make sure they're the best  and so that I won't look at anyone else,btohqsg
it's true esp when they're younger,btohqsg
Your type of guys are all fucked up,btohqsg
but doesn't mean no such thing as good guys,btohqsg
caught my exes checking out other girls when we went on dates,btohqsg
