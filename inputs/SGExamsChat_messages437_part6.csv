u go to Austria   sure sudden dip in spendings.,btohqsg
I was there when I was a kid. Maybe things chnged a lot.,btohqsg
yea it was. like top 10 in Europe,btohqsg
unsurprisingly the other top are in Switzerland,btohqsg
i'm sure you can guess Zurich is at the top,btohqsg
I thought St. Moritz is the one?,btohqsg
might be. i saw that  Zurich  Geneva,btohqsg
yea so the Matterhorn at Zermatt,btohqsg
i got that iconic picture with the toblerone bar,btohqsg
Did u buy the bar in ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ or buy from overseas?,btohqsg
i just bought it from the Zermatt shop,btohqsg
nah it was literally last year May to June lol,btohqsg
uhh my entire 17 day trip cost 5k,btohqsg
I can rmb the ride up to Matterhorn costs $80+,btohqsg
we booked our flights early so return trip SQ was only 1k,btohqsg
but ya for me i think I took the train up the Gornegrat,btohqsg
u got a good deal tho for direct,btohqsg
but in the future if go KL I wld rather take the train,btohqsg
ok my accommodation in total was about 750 SGD,btohqsg
$80+ train ride. Sure must keep.,btohqsg
the rest is just food and whatever we want to buy,btohqsg
I nvr buy the Swiss pass,btohqsg
we didn't find the swiss paass worth for us,btohqsg
like we wouldn't use it properly,btohqsg
Now they keep promoting it. I find Eurail + the discount card a better deal than Swiss pass alone.,btohqsg
god the last time I went europe was 7 years ago,btohqsg
Ya  but i mean the only places we went that needed transport outside of train was Geneva and Zurich and we just get day pass,btohqsg
we also went Brienz so just walk,btohqsg
I only took ktm to jb I think,btohqsg
can I just say that my trip made me love the Swiss trains SBB,btohqsg
For Brienz   I only got off the train to took a photo.,btohqsg
I love how we're having two convos again,btohqsg
ohh  yea stayed there for 2 nights in like a nice cottage airbnb  right next to the lake,btohqsg
one of my German friends alr warned me,btohqsg
uk that day I took one ICE that was delayed by 50 min. That â€˜s how suck it is.,btohqsg
I wanna try bvz forgot that experience,btohqsg
oh man if only you could see my friend gc,btohqsg
we had one day where we just went separately to do whatever we want,btohqsg
my friend wanted to visit Heidelberg and Tubingen,btohqsg
but he got stuck in Heidelberg because the train kept being delayed,btohqsg
My friend â€˜s friend also. Supposed to go to Paris from Frankfurt? End up got cancelled. Took the very long route to Paris.,btohqsg
oh we've had two more disasters,btohqsg
anyone know what happen to RP's cheerleading cca?,btohqsg
first one  we supposed to go from Salzburg to Stuttgart  and change at Munich for that. End up it got to Munich late so we missed the Stuttgart train  wait for next one. We happened to ask the station people whether we can still reserve seats for the next train  and they told us the train is leaving early  so we ran there and got free seats cos many people missed it,btohqsg
or is cheerleading not a sg thing,btohqsg
I heard that ETS seats are selling q well.,btohqsg
Damn. That â€˜s a bit disastrous. But turn out better in the end.,btohqsg
since I was in pri sch,btohqsg
He owes me a mountain trip,btohqsg
Second one is that my friend left Stuttgart for Amsterdam 3 hours earlier and had to stop at Frankfurt  while the rest of us went to Cologne. She missed her Amsterdam train and we passed Frankfurt before she left,btohqsg
