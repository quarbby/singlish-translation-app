"The Diablo received a mid-cycle facelift in 1999. Lamborghini simplified the model range by eliminating the ""base"" Diablo (since the SV model had become the new entry-level trim) and applied universal revisions across the lineup. The most immediately noticeable exterior change was the replacement of the previous Diablo's pop-up headlamp units with fixed composite lenses  borrowed under license from their original application in the Nissan 300ZX (Z32).",btohqsg
