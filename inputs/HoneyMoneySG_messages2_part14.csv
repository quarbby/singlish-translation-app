thats true also... dk what price the syfe use,btohqsg
when market down  transfer in ... it take few days,btohqsg
Syfe designed it to balance market representation with diversified exposure consisting of 20 REITs from retail  industrial  data centre  office  hospitality  and healthcare sectors.  Instead of maximizing the return.,btohqsg
Ya. So if u Have 10K in there it works out to 5$+/Month. Like a spotify subscription,btohqsg
Which etf? Per annum got 0.65%?,btohqsg
THE 0.65 is the platform fee for syfe. It is on top and over the expense ratio of your ETF. For example if u choose ARKK in syfe custom  u pay 0.75% for ARKK and 0.65 for syfe. This works out to be extremely expensive and not cost efficent over time,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI saw you have Syfe and Endowus. What about Stashaway? Which one is the best?,btohqsg
No i dont have stashaway haha,btohqsg
Before i start on it i already heard many bad stuff about it e.g. overweight on china exposure and gold,btohqsg
I saw my friendâ€™s StashAway portfolio and i also vomited by lunch from 5 weeks ago,btohqsg
Does endowus need minimum 10K to buy the mutual funds?,btohqsg
Min $1000 for endowus to start,btohqsg
I felt moomoo and tiger more better,btohqsg
How come the cash plus can lose capital one lol,btohqsg
Syfe has too many IG influencers promoting  check out#syfe,btohqsg
Haven't earn 1.5 % alrdy lose more than that loll ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
"Syfe IG usually will make wild claims of how syfe alone can help the influencer achieve financial ""independence"" not only for themselves  but their spouse  kid  unborn kids. Really? Show me your returns on core and reits especially",btohqsg
Their cash + more like cash minus. Suck u 1.5% pa. Even u put in POSB bank can earn more than cash + lol!,btohqsg
What bad investment they put in loll,btohqsg
That cash plus also lose capital,btohqsg
When they state 1.5 guaranteed isn't it,btohqsg
Some terrible lousy bonds  on top of that  they also love their kraneshares china exposure. Wanna lose more money,btohqsg
Not really. They said 1.5% projected. So it can be 0.000015 also can :-P. Not guaranteed,btohqsg
Oooo haha I only can say low risk is actually riskier,btohqsg
Stashaway got one like cash plus  it won't loss capital,btohqsg
When there's correction..  those small increase will be wiped out easily,btohqsg
Then that makes more sense haha,btohqsg
If can't even guarantee 1.5%   it's rly reflects v badly.,btohqsg
Stahsway one is 1.2% projected. For me I wouldn't bother with such low returns. Time to YOLO and put 100% stocks and equities + add in crypto,btohqsg
Yolo doesn't sounds like a good word to use,btohqsg
Last I put 2k at syfe reit 100%  after 3 month capital became $1929ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
One of their syfe IG influencers put 13K in syfe retis to get 120$ in dividend after 6 months Really? ðŸ¤¢ My tiger portfolio can get more than that in a day,btohqsg
No lah. As long don't yolo by doing risky options like wall Street bets ppl can alr,btohqsg
Jialat... That's why I withdraw from syfe Liao. Ya see  I'm not the only one where the capital drop below the AMT of dividend payout,btohqsg
Paper gains or u cashed out haha,btohqsg
Paper gains. I not cashing out anytime soon hahaha. I'm a longer. Not speculative shorter,btohqsg
Hahaha that's why I withdraw it too  put in moomoo  at least I know why I loss the capital  and know the market reit markets prices at where,btohqsg
I personally gave up on sg market / retis. Cos too low returns. Tho it's Kenna risky to be doing 100% us market. But that's where it's booming soooo. STI has been stagnant for years already,btohqsg
Sg market reit is quite stable just only return around4~6%ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I withdraw my retis alr. Left syfe core thinking whether to withdraw and put somewhere else to make it work harder for me,btohqsg
4-6% too low alr... ðŸ˜‚ I aim for 15-20%. Or beat s&p500,btohqsg
Us market need patient and strategic  up and down are very fast,btohqsg
How to make it 15-20%? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
It's ok. I got diamond hands. Won't sell so easily. Not paper hands,btohqsg
Large cap index funds + high growth stocks lo,btohqsg
Analysts said it was also all time high in December 2020 and now it is....? Hopefully don't explode like a bubble,btohqsg
Hahah now I only aim dividend stock and reit,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone here is good with REITs?,btohqsg
Just ask away  and we'll see how we can help,btohqsg
Basically I bought Keppel DC REIT at 2.350. Wanted to know if thatâ€™s a god buy ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
