Hm.. Hello  can someone share some insights as to why I should not mix investment and insurance tgt? I search online all I find was their high charges and fees. The ILP I am talking about is Pruvantage Assure.,btohqsg
Just paid my dad car road tax  discover an interesting payment option. So paypal was an payment option  meaning i dont have to go with the absolute amex>grab route. Instead  i just have to add my uob amex to the paypal and pay directly.,btohqsg
And  btw.. from what I have researched the usual ILP is that as we get older the monthly payment will get higher as for my this plan based on the agent I met she said I monthly $300 for 15 years. And I would also like to know what's your view on this plan. This is the very first policy I am thinking of buying by myself so I am very new to this. Thank you in advance for your views on this policy.,btohqsg
U alr found the ans. High charges and fees.,btohqsg
As an exfinancial adviser  i would seperate investment from insuranceReason beenInvesment flucuate  market can go down and upInsurance if for protection.While a hybrid of both sound like u get the best of both world but personally alot of my friend have to convert to other whole life limited pay policy (not sold by me) during 40 to 50 which they lost the advantage of low insurance fee when u buy insurance young,btohqsg
