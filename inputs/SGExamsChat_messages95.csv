It wasn’t worthy of the name,btohqsg
Or maybe even a book club,btohqsg
You should read A War of Gifts too,btohqsg
Same characters like Ender and Petra,btohqsg
Told from the perspective of Bean,btohqsg
Honestly best part abt the book was that I bought it by pure chance,btohqsg
Just thought the cover and synopsis looked cool,btohqsg
Despite the fact that it says ‘motion picture’ on the cover,btohqsg
Only knew abt it then la lol,btohqsg
Made by one of the guys who made rick and Marty,btohqsg
The last sitcom i watched was everybody loves raymond,btohqsg
Made me depressed but worth it,btohqsg
Tsk replying to a message buried all the way up,btohqsg
I still like this one more,btohqsg
I am good at destroying works of art,btohqsg
What do you need to draw,btohqsg
Says the creator of the sad smiley,btohqsg
all hail NTU  they accepted a 62.5 RP kid 😭😭😭,btohqsg
"btw is it normal for them to give you a ""random"" minor",btohqsg
they gave me Business minor but i didn't indicate it,btohqsg
i was thinking that they allocate minors based on availability of classes,btohqsg
and psychology/philosophy (the two i indicated) minors are probably less popular than business,btohqsg
its more popular than u think,btohqsg
philosophy I cant say much tho,btohqsg
so i got bamboozled by NTU maybe,btohqsg
well not complaining  business has practical uses,btohqsg
some of us will end up in a career not relevant to what we study,btohqsg
I'm curious about the statistics of this  like how many of us end up working a career where a majority of our knowledge/skills from our degree is unutilised,btohqsg
i see a man of culture,btohqsg
For science though  most ppl dont rly end up in a job related to their course of study in recent yrs,btohqsg
only community worth doing is community projects,btohqsg
U will end up doing it tho,btohqsg
I'll try to not to in uni,btohqsg
The only volunteering project I did in JC was a long term one,btohqsg
All scholars need do community projects,btohqsg
I just dislike those that go elderly home one time,btohqsg
Is it possible to change from a minor to a major after the 1st year? (or drop the minor and take the major of the exact same subject),btohqsg
U can change it to a second major,btohqsg
U just need to take more mods,btohqsg
That are required for second major,btohqsg
so e.g. civil engineering w/ minor in business to civil engineering w/ major in business,btohqsg
how come some of my whatsapp pics not going into my gallery,btohqsg
perhaps you need to save it to gallery manually,btohqsg
Urgh still got single digit cases,btohqsg
my online bmt extended if cb extends,btohqsg
Less time to prove yourself for OCS,btohqsg
Bruh u think bmt extension quite good right,btohqsg
The moment u enter camp after bmt,btohqsg
w-who say i want go ocs sia....,btohqsg
Ull be rushing modules and stuff,btohqsg
3 months compress into 1 month ish,btohqsg
That is if they do t want to delay ur pop,btohqsg
If they wan delay ur pop then even worse hahaha u serve longer bmt,btohqsg
It looks good but nothing is good about it u should be worried,btohqsg
to pay back the extra $70,btohqsg
ye I highly doubt it'll extend,btohqsg
I still havent gotten an offer sigh,btohqsg
should be within the next couple days,btohqsg
Tf why suddenly got sg incels appearing on my tiktok feed,btohqsg
ppl go extreme lengths to get 1 extra day stay home on monday in unit,btohqsg
read that as ppl go extreme lengths to get 1 extra,btohqsg
my friend ord with 6 extras left to serve,btohqsg
the only advantage of being in a huge camp,btohqsg
but other ppl send can save eh,btohqsg
check if autosave is on in ur settingsss,btohqsg
Anyone to help answer some Ns questions,btohqsg
Like after POP  how do they decide where do you get posted to,btohqsg
Like i have some friends who went to medic,btohqsg
Is there anything else other than 3 of thrm,btohqsg
Typically where do they get sent to?,btohqsg
U can choose but dont expect to get it,btohqsg
Transport supply infantry guards navy Air force Intel,btohqsg
I don't get what you're asking,btohqsg
There are people who know  but they can't share anyway.,btohqsg
"The long and short answer is probably""Manpower requirements""",btohqsg
Up to the need of the armed forces in that period of time,btohqsg
I mean this is the only way to talk about it without getting arrested pepega,btohqsg
"whenever the active batch of nsfs in a unit ord the unit will ""open up slots"" for the next pop cycle to receive intake",btohqsg
which basically means you cant predict or choose whr u go,btohqsg
Just have to pray for the lottery,btohqsg
The only real reason to watch it is the main character,btohqsg
But other than that  it’s pretty ok,btohqsg
I guess you could sell your soul to Lucifier,btohqsg
But I'd think Satan would be a better choice,btohqsg
Looks like someone needs to go to bible camp,btohqsg
Is that where you stretch your arm really long and then release it,btohqsg
i want to ask if i can move in to hostel 3-4 months before matriculation,btohqsg
Starts good  gets slowly worse towards end of Season 3  it becomes good in Season 4 again,btohqsg
Tho ippt is a bulk of it,btohqsg
Come be the SAF transfer INSP in SPF,btohqsg
U should ask ur SCS brother@tenersuertehe experienced,btohqsg
I have acheived the power of the gods this morning,btohqsg
Did u finally gain enuf rep on stackoverflow to answer questions ?,btohqsg
I learnt how to remove link previews on telegram,btohqsg
Oh my god i cant rickroll u anymore,btohqsg
Anyone also weak in redox reactions?,btohqsg
I thought you grad JC alr?,btohqsg
Just want to understand what's so difficult about redox,btohqsg
I know that mole concept is difficult to grasp. But redox and periodic table should be easier. Right? No?,btohqsg
Maybe it's gotta to do with the whole gaining and losing electrons thing,btohqsg
Some questions also like to test elements that can be oxidised and reduced at the same time,btohqsg
Think the student wasn't even sure Na oxidation state,btohqsg
Imo redox is harder than mole concept  esp when it comes to constructing half eqns and combining them together,btohqsg
same  even during As I think I got the redox qn wrong. Ochem was a lot easier imo.,btohqsg
Just imagining a mom coming in,btohqsg
U must be living in a cave,btohqsg
If you're willing to pay $300 you can,btohqsg
time to delet later accidentally get him caught,btohqsg
thats why must announce to everyone,btohqsg
Is it me or does grab not have McDonald,btohqsg
Or they closed their online restaurant cause too popular,btohqsg
No app  no grab  needs to go mcd website to order,btohqsg
I think I go McDonald  need walk there,btohqsg
Exactly 1 month i js realised,btohqsg
my hair nearing my chin alr,btohqsg

mcspicy must eat with the lettuce,btohqsg
Next time we go eat vegetarian food,btohqsg
No  carnivore food than I go,btohqsg
Guys  what’s the usual salary for an intern? The HR for the company that I’m about to intern at just called me and the base salary that I heard is 2X what I’m expecting lol. Was pleasantly surprised  in my head I’m like did I hear wrongly? But I’m like better not say anything until the contract is signed HAHAHA.,btohqsg
$25 per month for an intern?,btohqsg
might as well dont do lol,btohqsg
Higher than SAF NSF Recruit pay,btohqsg
Wait I don't see 25 in this message,btohqsg
2X as in multiply by 2,btohqsg
If your expectations were really low,btohqsg
I think I heard of seniors getting anywhere from $500 to $1000,btohqsg
I heard something higher than that. HAHA at this point I’ll just assume I heard wrongly. I’ll see what appears in the contract. 😂,btohqsg
For a uni intern I think you can fetch up to 1.2-1.6,btohqsg
Not sure if there's a differenciation in the years tbh,btohqsg
Cos I'm only basing my stats on a single experience,btohqsg
Oh the company which I interned for paid scholars 2k,btohqsg
But it's only a single stat,btohqsg
If ur handwriting is rubbish  they will deduct marks I thot,btohqsg
Idk my teacher mark o levels  say when they see unreadable handwriting  straight zero,btohqsg
Obv not like some snake like that,btohqsg
But can make sense can alr,btohqsg
After all it’s not my problem,btohqsg
Is y’all MEO give us so little time,btohqsg
But in hh pp  at the end u handwriting will prob turn into straight lines,btohqsg
I doubt they ever purposely deduct marks. It's more like not award marks because cant read cant judge. So instead of actively deducting marks for handwriting it's more like your handwriting self-imposed a mark ceiling on your work.,btohqsg
But social studies example seem to be very easy for the most part rite?,btohqsg
Idk my school uses that abbreviation,btohqsg
LMAO I have never seen History abbreviated as HH,btohqsg
I've only seen Hist/HY/if you wanna force it HI,btohqsg
u know papers are marked several times right,btohqsg
If your sch abbreviate Hist as HH,btohqsg
Does your sch abbreviate Geog as GG?,btohqsg
so even if examiner 1 cant read it or marks it  it will be passed to examiner 2 which will mark it again also,btohqsg
that's if im not mistaken  for certain subjects,btohqsg
Idk he said he talked with the other examiner about it.,btohqsg
WTF lol all the geog candidates be going GG when they leave the exam hall then,btohqsg
LOL mood when I took o lvl geog,btohqsg
Or examiner 2 can’t read it either,btohqsg
it gets passed to a chief presiding examiner thereafter lol,btohqsg
its like a chain of command,btohqsg
Or they also can’t read it,btohqsg
how bad must your handwriting be,btohqsg
At that point they'll probably let you use a computer,btohqsg
Himmler  was watching Man in the High Castle these past few days  really great illustration of an alt history for the first 2 seasons at least,btohqsg
thats why MOE is exploring digital exams,btohqsg
That your bad handwriting is caused by a medical condition  there's actually a medical condition that curses the person with bad handwriting no matter how hard they try.,btohqsg
but alas  definition of a bad handwriting is quite subjective  I have yet to see one so far by my standards of bad handwriting :S,btohqsg
maybe i can judge if u send me a pic of ur work HAHA,btohqsg
I see a man of culture,btohqsg
Yea that's still readable but yea ewww,btohqsg
Handwriting do affect an examiner mood,btohqsg
But if she or he alr marked 1000 script?,btohqsg
Bcuz the previous 999 alr so ugly,btohqsg
Imagine seeing so many ugly ass handwriting,btohqsg
Just go and copy this chat in 5 mins,btohqsg
My classmate constantly deduct marks in compo cus handwriting is shit,btohqsg
Try to write in the lines provided next time,btohqsg
My that ugly handwriting becomes worse,btohqsg
Ltr correction tape and then become paint,btohqsg
Else too sharp keep Piercjng paper,btohqsg
How to tell what spam is exactly? Got algorithms?,btohqsg
This one still ok la lol,btohqsg
This handwriting almost looks like demonic symbolism,btohqsg
I need my pdfs to be crisp even while zoomed in at 1600%,btohqsg
It's practically closed like all unis,btohqsg
Imagine a room about the size of sec school classrooms,btohqsg
In use by about 8 people,btohqsg
Hey we can go running outside without mask right,btohqsg
I knew you were going to say that,btohqsg
"If you are not using paper  you are ""wasting"" the efforts and materials to make that piece of paper",btohqsg
But by using paper  you are encouraging paper companies to make more paper,btohqsg
You’re a villain in the long run,btohqsg
By using the iPad you are promoting child labour,btohqsg
It is time to introduce you to the magical website called overleaf,btohqsg
Children need to be exposed to the cruelty of the world early,btohqsg

guys do yall know if we can accept a uni during the first phase and if we get offered by another uni during the second window  can we accept the second one and reject the first one,btohqsg
I mean how is the experience there?,btohqsg
Anything more specific? Gotta say all 4 pillars different experience,btohqsg
Archi: dunnid sleep. Panic before crit day (weekly)Engr Sys: sleep a lot  math good = sleep even moreISTD: salt mine  get meme management and consumption experienceProd Dev: make stuff. Unless electrical. Then maybe make stuff. I'd say there are quite a few landmarks in the life of a student tho I think it depends on your track as well,btohqsg
Weren't you here a long time ago,btohqsg
Nope. Never been to the chat.,btohqsg
What are u doing in the slums,btohqsg
Quick hide ur degeneracy. Cant let fuzzy know@Secrethaha@chemcer,btohqsg
If I had to choose Korean version or Canadian Version of Pythagorean theorem. I’ll choose Canadian way. Korean way of Pythagorean theorem is waaay too much confusing to me 😂😂,btohqsg
Is maths different in different languages?,btohqsg
So kady from mean girls lied that math is all the same in all countries then,btohqsg
I can show u but it’s a link so imma pm u,btohqsg
I like Korean black pink only,btohqsg
in some weird bandwagoned communities 1+1 = 1,btohqsg
yo am I allowed to post my PW survey link here,btohqsg
if you want you can try asking in discord,btohqsg
nope  go to our discord @go.exams.sg/discord,btohqsg
haven't heard of that term for a long time,btohqsg
Since Canada’s math is slower than Korea a bit. So I’m reviewing or learning it in Korean way,btohqsg
Oi I thought u were going to sleep,btohqsg
I live in Canada so it won’t be my homework,btohqsg
And you won’t hear it again,btohqsg
I turned off my phone for 1 minutes and there was 10 messages 😱😱,btohqsg
I mute once and I had my messages until 4K before 😂😂,btohqsg
not if I become a teacher,btohqsg
Are you going to be a teacher?,btohqsg
May as well pick your favourite poison,btohqsg
Teachers have to do what government want them to do. Think about student’s work  Mark a test / quiz/ exams. Talking to parents about the kids. Strikes school,btohqsg
My grandpa and my Aunt was English and math teacher,btohqsg
Father and daughter both became teacher with different subject,btohqsg
Teachers don’t have it easy nowadays 😭,btohqsg
there’s lots of marking even into the holidays,btohqsg
Getting to talk about your favourite subject to a bunch of kids and helping them learn about it,btohqsg
And the kids can be pretty cool,btohqsg
The kids are half the reason to do the job,btohqsg
Who is poor in redox reactions and mole concept?,btohqsg
yeah but one of my parent’s a teacher and happens that class has some really hard to deal w students :((,btohqsg
What is it in that topics u can't get it?,btohqsg
Is it the + - oxidation states thing and the equations?,btohqsg
I can't do that for nuts,btohqsg
Mole concept is to help in Chemical equations  so that u can get maximum yield thus maximum profits,btohqsg
Tat is if u want to be chemist in manufacturing area,btohqsg
I lack practice and the be-able-to-derive-solutions-fast ability,btohqsg
like that feeling when u know you might eventually get the answer  but u just don’t see it as fast as others do,btohqsg
Comparing to others isn’t very good idea,btohqsg
The journey rather than the destination,btohqsg
me trying to get the mcmurry book,btohqsg
I didn't enjoy my gp journey though,btohqsg
GP is a journey through life,btohqsg
So you are still on your GP journey,btohqsg
wot there’s a soft copy? I dumb,btohqsg
is like lit in secondary school x2,btohqsg
Examples shouldn’t be a problem if u read up on your topics enough,btohqsg
Paper 1’s main difficult thing is coming up with points,btohqsg
Once u get started  it’s easier,btohqsg
Maybe paper 1 should be an oral paper then,btohqsg
Then it’d be fun and everyone would love it,btohqsg
why can't H1 chinese replace GP,btohqsg
only thing I like about jc gp is no oral,btohqsg
ikr I feel like I’ll do better in Chinese,btohqsg
huh H1 chinese only has a 20% dist rate?,btohqsg
No one in my class got an A for H1 CL,btohqsg
If he’s not ur year head then he’s not year head,btohqsg
Wait then how do u know him,btohqsg
hes the year head I think in charge of j1,btohqsg
ofc i k he’s always briefing during orientation lol,btohqsg
He was my year head (J3) too  so that makes sense,btohqsg
Oh  that means we should have the same batch of teachers,btohqsg
then why do you need mcmurry,btohqsg
I heard it’s good for organic chem which I’ll learn at the end of the year,btohqsg
thought you're interested in H3 chem,btohqsg
Our skool notes are not bad,btohqsg
Aren’t your skool notes written by a professor,btohqsg
nope h3 chem I’ll die h3 peeps are geniuses,btohqsg
I wonder if my maths teacher has gotten his PhD yet,btohqsg
Worth taking just to learn new things  even if u don’t do well in exam,btohqsg
let me do my h2 chem well first XD,btohqsg
chinese will be the death of me,btohqsg
wanting to get A is too scary,btohqsg
A for normal chinese or HMT?,btohqsg
its only may idk how ill get through october,btohqsg
If u have no expectations u won’t be disappointed,btohqsg
i am expected to get A,btohqsg
john went from C6 to A1,btohqsg
i went from f9 to b3 only :<,btohqsg
we should all type in Chinese starting from now,btohqsg
i think mine opp but im not even A1,btohqsg
everyone was shocked af when he got A1,btohqsg
I learned how to copy answer from passage,btohqsg
i do that but im nowhere in an A,btohqsg
+ I listen to a lot of chinese songs at the start of the year,btohqsg
Dox John and dox his grades,btohqsg
wait how did u do fr the mcq,btohqsg
only diff is i didnt get a1,btohqsg
Plus also I was motivated to do good for chinese,btohqsg
just listen to chinese songs from the start,btohqsg
burn the Chinese dictionary and drink it,btohqsg
But for MCQ i mainly just read the passage and answer the question,btohqsg
For mcq I mainly roll a dice,btohqsg
I also didn’t count my marks for that,btohqsg
i failed that + lc in last year finals,btohqsg
but i mean if u got A1,btohqsg
i got b3 in the end,btohqsg
don't care about how much you've gotten,btohqsg
I think my P2 was just alright,btohqsg
But my P1 was pretty good,btohqsg
are you a 周杰伦 or 林俊杰 person,btohqsg
I wrote in stuff about history and shit,btohqsg
i listen to jj lin and eric chou,btohqsg
sis got her b3 so das good,btohqsg
i wrote abt friendship and backstabbers,btohqsg
I was too lazy to think of points,btohqsg
I switched to story writing for H1 CL,btohqsg
but it's not as easy as primary school,btohqsg
In some ways  H1 is easier than O,btohqsg
Eg for oral they tell you the topics that’s gonna come out,btohqsg
unless you take Chinese Studies in poly,btohqsg
oh my oral was on conservation of finite resources,btohqsg
They tell u that it’s tech and social media,btohqsg
Oh  I guess my O Level oral helped too,btohqsg
my A level oral was about culture and tradition LOL,btohqsg
i talked abt turning off lights HAHA,btohqsg
I hit all the marks of a good oral,btohqsg
i failed oral last year so im deadass scared,btohqsg
B4 to C5 cos of oral and lc,btohqsg
Wait  when do u do O Level CL oral again,btohqsg
only my p1 & compre good,btohqsg
LC difficult or easy to score points,btohqsg
Lc supposed to be easy leh,btohqsg
im rly good at compre and essay,btohqsg
what if you get a China gf,btohqsg
Those are the ones that matter anyway,btohqsg
idk why i good at those to begin w tho,btohqsg
HAHA my chinese has alwys been,btohqsg
My Lit and EL were 2 grades apart,btohqsg
O level eng harder to study,btohqsg
eng i used common sense and general knowledge,btohqsg
I think it’s the other way around,btohqsg
Paper 1 can memorise content what,btohqsg
Paper 2 really depends on the passage,btohqsg
Can learn all the question formats and shit,btohqsg
AQ is the only wild card,btohqsg
my passage for o's was abt incest !,btohqsg
compre wise there are some techniques which may help,btohqsg
u js need to uds the passge,btohqsg
I always whack when I do english,btohqsg
i js read alot of books,btohqsg
I read a lot of books,btohqsg
Oral comes after P1 and 2?,btohqsg
