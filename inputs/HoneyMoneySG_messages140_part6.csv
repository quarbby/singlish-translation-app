Hihi! My fiance and I are expecting big-ticket purchases for our BTO in the coming months. We currently hold a Citi SMRT card and a Citi Rewards card.Are there any other good cards for big-ticket purchases that we can consider applying for?,btohqsg
This 1 I agree  the 15% Cashback is really bonus when I was in Japan.Tax free + good fx + 15% Cashback.The only setback is some of the MCC is damn monkey,btohqsg
So far (touch wood) I use dbs to do a fast transfer and have not tried using paynow with comments. However you could try and see if it is captured on next week.,btohqsg
Hey  I am looking to apply for the Highflyer Card. Is it only available for business owners?,btohqsg

I hate the new sc smart card update,btohqsg
Hi all  just confirming for UOB lady's card under transport cat   we will get 4 mpd for bus/mrt?,btohqsg
Naisee  might switch to that and cancel scb,btohqsg
Any idea of the top up of alipay tourcard  what is the mcc?,btohqsg
Note: 60 days bonus interest boost is only applicable for trading days. So holding period is longer than 60 days due to PH and Weekends.,btohqsg
I currently hold UOB lady (Secured)  plan to apply for UOB PPV through secured as well.Can advise if the only option to do so is by visiting branch?,btohqsg
they gonna introduce tiered spending cashback and annual fees.,btohqsg
Hi. For the first time  my credit card had unauthorised transaction. This affected my OCBC 90N. I have raised dispute and it blocked my card already. Seems like this could happen to anyone and anytime. I didn't get the notification for foreign currency apparently. For your info only.,btohqsg
you could set notification limit to lower  such as 0.1$ so you catch such trx.,btohqsg
I did. It seems that I set it for local txn. Didn't know there should be somewhere to set for foreign txn  separately,btohqsg
I'm not sure about the functions of the OCBC app. But UOB and DBS allows users to temporarily block cards. I always block my card. When I need to make payment  I will unlock the card. After payment I will block again. Very troublesome but it makes me less worried.,btohqsg
I would think so. Before can apply online for additional card as secured card holder. Recently kena rejected for application.,btohqsg
What card were you holding at that point and what card did you applied?,btohqsg
I have lot of uob cc lol. I was trying for uob krisflyer,btohqsg
Ok I just applied online. Usually takes only a few days for them to approve/reject right?,btohqsg
Yes  if fail then go in branch loh,btohqsg
Are there any ways to avoid DCC fees from agoda and other booking platforms?,btohqsg
for agoda specifically  use visa card. In general  use amex card cuz amex does not do dcc.,btohqsg
Why don't you lock your card when not in use?,btohqsg
theres no dcc for visa for agoda?,btohqsg
for agoda  payment gateway for visa is in singapore so no dcc. gateway for mastercard is in hk so 1% dcc.,btohqsg
Anyone tried paying ST via app today? Seems to go through AXS now  wondering if will still qualify for fnf rebate,btohqsg
Did you enable oversea transactions notifications by email or sms in Ocbc apps for your 90N card?,btohqsg
But isn’t the points for every $5 you get 1 point 😭,btohqsg
what’s the best bank to use as a savings account for ns,btohqsg
I thought the uob lady's accumulated end of the month? You will only get 1 uni$ after each transaction,btohqsg
Anyone bought from Lazada using uob ppv and did not receive bonus miles?,btohqsg
As of now I choose dining  but I got other card can supplement it. So uob lady's before like a backup for me,btohqsg
Did ur Lazada transaction start with 2c2*?There has been ongoing issue if lazada transaction starts w that.,btohqsg
Yes my previous 3 transactions starts with that and all didn't qualify for the bonus miles. Are there any ways around it?,btohqsg
Does using amaze to top up manja travel card earn 10x points?,btohqsg
i might be wrong but i think nothttps://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/ladys-cards-tcs.pdf?vid=MindshareSG&pid=LSCPRSCOi only just got my card approved 2 weeks ago haha. maybe can hear what others say,btohqsg
only way is try appeal with uob. Next time use dbs wwmc which managed to charge 2C2 as online.,btohqsg
UOB lady (and UOB visa signature too) has 2 components  base 0.4mpd and bonus 3.6mpd.For each transaction  amount will be rounded down per 5$ block and award 0.4mpd. At month end  UOB will add everything up  round down final amount to block of 5$ and award 3.6mpd.,btohqsg
thanks Anthony!> At month end  UOB will add everything up  round down final amount to block of 5$ and award 3.6mpd.3 6mpd is for those under the category you selected right?,btohqsg
If they accumulate a few days transaction into one transaction I think is fine. Than end of month accumulate again,btohqsg
Can't rmb how they charge   last time I use priv miles for mrt etc before switching to scb smart,btohqsg
yeah i suppose! let me read the t&cs again. i might have missed this,btohqsg
Bonus point for UOB cards on simplygo.Mastercard: transaction will be posted every 5 days or every 15$ accumulated  whichever is fasterVisa: transaction will be accumulated and posted end of the month.Both will be subjected to 5$ block rounding.,btohqsg
Btw all guru  my parents going china hk Macau. Planning to pass them credit card to use. But I never been the places before. Is cc widely accepted or just download alipay etc. need recommendation if not likely old school way take cash 😂,btohqsg
