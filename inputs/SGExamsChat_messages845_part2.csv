pasir ris vs tampines redevelopment priority be like,btohqsg
tampines is a much more developed town area compared to pasir ris,btohqsg
Before the interchange came into operation  bus services in Tampines operated out ofTampines Bus Terminallocated at Tampines Avenue 5  near the present-day Blk 938. Set up in 1983  the roadside terminal catered to bus services before the permanent interchange was opened.,btohqsg
even though the development planning & organization was very messy,btohqsg
at least stuff is being done,btohqsg
last time a lot of bus interchanges operated in that manner,btohqsg
but i was like very young when i was brought around to sightsee in sg,btohqsg
i think i ever encountered the process where they finalized the transfer of the former tamp bus terminal,btohqsg

i also have a lot of vague recollections from my childhood days,btohqsg
coz i moved to sg when i had already turned 2 years old,btohqsg
