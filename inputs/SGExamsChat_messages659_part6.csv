I got lazy to apply for psc,btohqsg
for PSC teaching you have to roleplay as a teacher,btohqsg
with the assessors as ur students,btohqsg
be it local or overseas uni,btohqsg
oso psc is a damn good title to have,btohqsg
I only know moe is 5 years,btohqsg
the psc scholars i know are mostly quite rambos leh,btohqsg
I have faith in one psc scholar,btohqsg
idk see which psc it is,btohqsg
Wait what I never knew thereâ€™s diff types,btohqsg
if ur vocation is related to ur bond then yea,btohqsg
and ur bond is 6 years or sth as a teacher,btohqsg
I thought of psb academy Welp idk why my brain thought of that out of the blue,btohqsg
isnt it damn hard to get it tho,btohqsg
bout to drop out of ntu to go there,btohqsg
Might as well just apply for moe scholarship at that point since they only require 5 years,btohqsg
almost a 100 students for my friends batch,btohqsg
tot like only 5 ppl get one psc per dept per year,btohqsg
i have interacted with a few and a common trait i have noticed among all of them is that they have super strong opinions and it manifests in 2 waysthe positive way is that they are legit game changersthe negative way is that they are elitist,btohqsg
That is if they wanna become a Cher,btohqsg
i have 2 friends in psc,btohqsg
normally its between 50-100 students per batch,btohqsg
lol not surprised that theyre elitist,btohqsg
which tracks with any ministry level scholarship (MND EDGE Scholarship  SAF Merit scholarship etc.),btohqsg
lowkey shouldve just done that  wouldve been finishing by now lmao,btohqsg
batch as in the entire sg cohort?,btohqsg
i mean idk how uw define batch la,btohqsg
like it can be anyone between the ages of 19 to like whatever the max age is,btohqsg
my sch only allow top 50 ppl to apply iirc,btohqsg
psc is normally RI  HCI  ACSI dominated,btohqsg
my batch in EJ has one?,btohqsg
and this is where the EJ drama comes in!!!,btohqsg
cuz apparantly ej shat on her for her entire referral,btohqsg
was her clarifying whatever ej wrote abt her,btohqsg
like apparantly the SCH made shit up abt her,btohqsg
so that she wont get the scholarship,btohqsg
in comparison to this other girl who applied for the exact scholarship (who is also the star student of EJ),btohqsg
(the nepo baby into NUS medicine),btohqsg
where they celebrate very very few students,btohqsg
and only give the opportunities to them,btohqsg
"so they dont like it when other students come out of left field and ""steals"" the opportunities",btohqsg
acc to some of the ej teachers la,btohqsg
hold up  my sch does this also,btohqsg
i think ej was rly scared of this girl winning this over another girl,btohqsg
and mine ip so they groomed the student from sec1 all the way to j2 LOL,btohqsg
"the ""left field"" girl got it",btohqsg
cuz the girl that got it right,btohqsg
she just doesnt have the same level of connections as the star student,btohqsg
mine also is damn ass cuz we got 3 IP JCs,btohqsg
then everyone thinks their gods gift to mankind or smth,btohqsg
