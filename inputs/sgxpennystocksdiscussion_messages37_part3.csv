UG tmr gap up !! Huat ah,btohqsg
UG entering China market.  Epic Huat.,btohqsg
China Kungda report fonts all in green color,btohqsg
but looks like report negative loss,btohqsg
UG very soon will break the all time high $3.44 !! Huat ah,btohqsg
today trading very suspicious for UG - tight range 257 to 264 with controlled low volume !!,btohqsg
China medical consumable are always a big question mark. If China government is willing to let in company like UG and possibly Medtec to raise their medical standards  will be a tremendous opportunity for the involved companies.,btohqsg
Very interesting honestly  whatever they are doing. 2 SSH from different sides loading up a counter even when there is minor ongoing chairman bankrupt scandal for company.Was vested for some time but have taken profit for most of my holdings when I heard about the chairman bankruptcy status . Just holding a small position .Wish all Hanwell holders good luck.,btohqsg
Its normal for UG low volume due to low float. Today MT volume is totally being ignored.,btohqsg
I say MT volume is like kena ignored ma,btohqsg
Is that the reason why UG did placement?,btohqsg
Low float up down very fast,btohqsg
Price suppression too Long  considering it is a high profile company.  Ummmmmmm,btohqsg
No. The placement is to build factory to increase production in malaysia,btohqsg
Just rise from 0.97 to 1.34 recently,btohqsg
Now stabilize at 1.2 for a few days only,btohqsg
hi how does new deal work for SYNAGIe ？,btohqsg
All bleeding so badly. Can even recognise their own home.,btohqsg
You bought at high can't complain the stock run slow,btohqsg
In fact I think MT run quite fast Liao,btohqsg
Be it up or down movement,btohqsg
From 0.97 to 1.34 in like 2 days,btohqsg
I still learning  just my personal observation.,btohqsg
MT if can slowly climb back up and let people loss lesser is already a blessing.Just relax and don’t panic too much,btohqsg
Why panic? Just eat some cheesecake and drink wine,btohqsg
Well I talk hindsight a bitIf one bought at 1.6 and average down at 1,btohqsg
Althought I won't have hold 1.6 until now,btohqsg
See our Bro AC highest buy for MT 1.8 his average price for MT only 0.3,btohqsg
I vested at the 20ish series.,btohqsg
Let Taiwanese company go in china to bring up their standard?Muhahahaha,btohqsg
Then can't understand why you complaining it's slow already,btohqsg
u also noticed  but different scenario  MT - today and tmr - T+4  flushing out small players,btohqsg
Bopian  C19 more dangerous than Atomic  bomb.,btohqsg
China got enough population.National pride cannot let go,btohqsg
Just a discussion after my dinner. Chill.,btohqsg
dont see howpreviously wife and husband paid a lotnow husband left wife should be going to want to declare her salary more so fighting.lets see how this turn out,btohqsg
maybe lure goi into buying to stop her remuneration,btohqsg
Very chillWhy I always perceived as perm on fire haha,btohqsg
then buy her out or something,btohqsg
She bought more than sam recentlyAnyway sam is friendly. He doesn’t take any board seat,btohqsg
Sam don’t do buyouts. He get bought outAt a big premium,btohqsg
then even more no sense leh,btohqsg
Because your words not very straight forward,btohqsg
she will declare her salary higher now that husband get kickout,btohqsg
hanwell and tatseng is plagued by this problem,btohqsg
I quite direct liaoExpecting china to let medtecs go in to educate their medical companiesEh.... what’s next? Martian place order with Clement,btohqsg
unless can find why to boot them out,btohqsg
She is an executive director and remuneration committee will determine her remuneration and she has to abstain if she is in RC,btohqsg
something like our ministers like that,btohqsg
I will prefer to believe in their corporate governance especially now no chairman and sam is watching,btohqsg
