My view is - 18 July is the hard loan maturity date for all the facilities. If the refi/extensionis successful  management should announce it since they alr have the info. If the refi failed  obvious the next step is EFR/rights issue  then halt the stock. Its irresponsible to continue trading with retail shareholder basically gambling at this poiint on the price action and biting the teeth at the next step. Very shocking management,btohqsg

I see it as no tighter control so ask elderly stay home,btohqsg
