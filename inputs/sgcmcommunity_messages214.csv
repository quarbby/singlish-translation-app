Hi! Maybe you foreigner but you can get a sim card at some shops for only $38 like that,btohqsg
These pple who ask for spare physical sims simply are most likely into illicit activities using these sims for communication for getting unsuspecting locals to sell their bank accounts singpass access or even facilitating those moneylending  ALong who come to ur doors to harass spray paint etc. And other crimes. If u pass ur sim card ure implicated. And possibly could end up serving jailtime or criminal fines/records. Be careful,btohqsg

LTA to implement measures to improve P2P industryWith Phase One of LTA's P2P review commencing on 1 January 2025  Phase Two will begin in March 2025  with LTA tackling issues the P2P industry faces.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Hmm.. new measures 🙊,btohqsg
So where is the oil going to be disposed off?,btohqsg
Peugeot quality has improved a lot over the years. My 7.7 year old Peugeot has no major issues so far. More reliable than my previous VW. But one think I must admit  french design cars to look good but not practical to service. Eg  in order to change battery  have to strip so many things. Engine filter is located deep under the engine bay  below the windscreen  breaking my back when changing it.,btohqsg
Same question I had. I tried changing oil once  then realised I don't know how to dispose the oil. Workshops need to pay for disposal so unless you know the workshop well  can pass to them to help. End up I passed the oil to a friend to help dispose at his construction workplace.,btohqsg

the drive very dynamic .. nice I quite like it,btohqsg
