If it’s been so long it’s likely chronic,btohqsg
Could possibly be something like anemia,btohqsg
idk how i coped with it for so long,btohqsg
i feel like as kuro said,btohqsg
Yeah don’t wait too long  if there is some underlying condition better get it checked up while it can be reversed,btohqsg
it could be a side effect of unhealthy lifestyles,btohqsg
Anyway just don’t delay the doc visit too long  health is wealth,btohqsg
Looks like some rose syrup or some fruit punch cocktail,btohqsg
Like I suspect I may have prediabetes or even diabetes so I just went to get a blood test recently,btohqsg
I also watching my diet more now,btohqsg

Things became funny after my last covid episode,btohqsg
It's the yin and yang of life,btohqsg
Just go for a blood test ah,btohqsg
If you in NS it’s free,btohqsg
Better to err on the side of caution,btohqsg
Like just go see a doctor at the polyclinic  ask them take blood pressure and say you want a blood test,btohqsg
Then you can make an appointment after the visit,btohqsg

But ig it’s better to take again since it’s no cost,btohqsg
But also it’s been reported that catching Covid increases the risk of diabetes for whatever unknown reasons,btohqsg
