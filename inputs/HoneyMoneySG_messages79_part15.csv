When i transfer the money into webull account. Does it take sometime for it to appear on moneybull? I have activated moneybull and currently on margin account. TIA.,btohqsg
please go read tnc of credit card exclusion  purchasing or prepaid or top up of voucher etc are often a exclusion but what people have been doing is buying voucher to earn miles and rebate. this is the reason why a lot have been asking if buying voucher is valid purchase or not,btohqsg
anyway i understand that there will always have people who follow book by book and those who think out of box  so it is entirely up to individual to decide how they want to play the miles game and benefit from it. it is ok to disagree.,btohqsg
MAB for current month min $500 higher than MAB for previous year,btohqsg
if i exceeded 1k for citi rewards  comparing premier miles (2 mpd incur 3.25% fx fees) and premier miles + amaze (1.2mpd). which one more worth?,btohqsg
What is the value you attribute to a mile? (E.g. 1.5 cents  1.7 cents),btohqsg
Whats the best way to buy ethereum from singapore?,btohqsg
So $150K*15 + $50K*15 + $50x earlier in the month should be okay then?,btohqsg
depends what was the MAB for previous month,btohqsg
then ok assuming +$500 in on 1st of month before 9pm and 1st of month is not sunday or public holiday. If 1st is Sunday or public holiday then need to topup more as any transfer in will only be reflected next work day.,btohqsg
Can travel anywhere and work from anywhere any time,btohqsg
probably because she has no full time job? but income from youtube and other partnership,btohqsg
Yes  nominee can be anyone  krisflyer did not mention relatives,btohqsg
Then you transfer back $50k + $50?  on 1st day of next month ? If not  you can‚Äôt get the ocbc interest on third month.Eg. $100k  $100k + $50x  $50k+$50? X 2.,btohqsg
Yes.Once the funds are deposited  which can be instant or a few hours or days depending on the type of transfer  Webull will put your funds into moneybull after the stated cut-off times.You can check the moneybull fund to see what are the buy and sell order timings.,btohqsg
Hello! Im abit confused  if anyone can help clarify. I understand UOB PPV earns 4mpd for contactless spends (regardless of MCC  and as long as not under exclusion list).I just read that can use Kris+ and PPV via apple pay  to stack the rewards  meaning X miles offered by Kris+ PLUS the 4mpd from PPV. (Saw the example given for dining in a restaurant)Is this combi (Kris+ & PPV) only for certain MCC though? Cos I thought Kris+ is considered online spend? (hence wont fulfil contactless criteria if i use it) & I didnt know that dining MCC is eligible for 4mpd!Thanks üôèüèª,btohqsg
Should be for anything that accepts kris+,btohqsg
Meaning anything that accepts Kris+  I can use UOB PPV and definitely get the 4mpd? (Dont need to care about underlying MCC?),btohqsg
no  using uob ppv for online only gets 4mpd for a whitelist of MCCs. Read the TnC,btohqsg
Got it!Means must also get the MCC right  cant just use for all kris+ paymentThanks!,btohqsg

Hi may I know why for 5944  able to do Amaze + UOB KF for 3 mpd?,btohqsg
I recently tried to apply for an account but apparently need to video call ? Is it like this for everyone or,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. It seems like the platform only allow users to filter based on card type (miles or cashback) and bank name. I have to scroll down and expand one by one to check the min spend criteria for each card. Nevertheless  it‚Äôs a very useful tool for a newbie like me. üòÖ,btohqsg
Eh? Sign up with Singpass no need anything‚Ä¶ video call not for credit card one meh?,btohqsg
If go for Maribank  you can put some into their Mariinvest for better potential returns.,btohqsg
A qns on citi rewards with amaze  read up mobile app payment not supported I.e. Gpay  apple pay. Is there other platform I can pay using NFC?,btohqsg
I didn't need a video call when I signed up,btohqsg
Amaze card can be linked to Google Pay  if that's what you're asking,btohqsg
You can get 3.5% p.a. returns with CIMB FastSaver 6 months promo  or if you're okay to lock up your money  POSB SAYS account,btohqsg
Yes I know it can be linked  so if I use the amaze card on Gpay  will I get 4 miles per dollar? Cos I read mobile app payment won't get u 4miles per dollar,btohqsg
Is mariinvest daily interest credit as well ?,btohqsg
Yes. All amaze card transactions will be recorded on your Citi Rewards statement as online transactions  earning you 10X points,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not the bank. Usually it‚Äôs sq that suspend the account. FYI.,btohqsg
Hi All For those who have apply new saving acc for CIMB. The chart is for illustration purposes or I have to follow?,btohqsg
50000citibank points...shd i chg to scoot or airasia?,btohqsg
Yes coz it is krisflyer acct of coz is sq  but normal seller only have limited miles to sell  it is not as if it is unlimited or great amt to trigger suspension for most seller.,btohqsg
depends on where you wanna fly to,btohqsg
Hi  may I check if using amaze+crmc on grab eligible for 10x points?,btohqsg
Yes if charged directly. Wallet top ups wont qualify,btohqsg
Jus to check  after 55  assuming you hit ERS  can you still top up money to your RA/SA?,btohqsg
Your fund value will grow according to the NAV value. As it‚Äôs an investment  it‚Äôs not as guaranteed as a savings account interest rate.But mariinvest still can withdraw anytime for $10K and below and the fund is relatively damn low risk.,btohqsg
