Some reits can move already....  no chance to offload already,btohqsg
I am preparing for a multi years low share price,btohqsg
Only shares with solid dividend can consider keeping,btohqsg
Some Oversea Govt start to break down due to debt and food crisis,btohqsg
hahaha  of all counters this one. I'm thinking of cut lose already,btohqsg
If you believe you can buy cheaper later  should consider encashing,btohqsg
Like that say  banks also can encash,btohqsg
Just recently you keep saying buy reits? I'm confused,btohqsg
I believe the fed will crash the market sooner or later,btohqsg
Nanofilm📽️ +4.6%Salted 🐟 body turned 😛If can close$2.50or above.. prefect,btohqsg
If you folloe market cycle... Finance -> utility-> REIT,btohqsg

I buy in then will crash,btohqsg
mai lah.. mai 🐈 bounce lahtbc next wk candlestick 🕯️,btohqsg
Yes  next time you buy I better run first,btohqsg
Ideally  sell high before crash  buy low after crash,btohqsg
But what if the crash doesn't happen?,btohqsg
Thinking STI may test triple top before coming back down,btohqsg
That's why I'm still holding to all my counters leh,btohqsg
Normally triple 🔝 will BO IMO😅,btohqsg
So... Keep those you can stomach the lows (collect dividends) and prepare to whack when the crash comes,btohqsg
So long got some standby bullets for crash will do,btohqsg
The question is... How many bullets,btohqsg
For me  I'm 50% invested now. Think ideal is to hold more cash now,btohqsg
Matex Life won't go over 35. Once touch will goes down again,btohqsg
The more the merrier if crash really comes,btohqsg
Everyday I think about when crash coming,btohqsg
Best period is after crash... No need to think so much,btohqsg

Some counters took shares instead of cash for dividends  now don't know how to sell,btohqsg
There write in multiples of 100  I haven't try odd lots,btohqsg
Have to contact broker and ask to sell,btohqsg

Here’s an interesting economic question. Does inflation drive demand or will it reduce demand of consumer goods?,btohqsg
Consumer goods refers to a wide range of goods. Discretionary? Staples?,btohqsg
Not all good will be hit equally,btohqsg
Bottom range staples.. will be likely hit.. as people will now shift to cheaper alternatives because it is now priced outside of their comfort zone,btohqsg
Inflation will then have to be considered with respect to the countries demographics,btohqsg
Some countries with more spending power will see their middle class continuing their expenditure.. while those in countries with less than stable situations will likely cut down..,btohqsg
Economist statement. Inflation will make the basic goods more expensive  so the people will have to spend a larger portion of their income on the necessities  and have less spending power on discrenationaries,btohqsg
I rarely order drinks nowadays when having lunch/dinner to control spending 😭,btohqsg
I almost never order drinks... Since donkey years ago... The kopi aunties everytime gave me that disgusted look...,btohqsg
ArionEnt might come too. Seems like NTE done with the selling.Most of the recent big hands changed at $0.011 recently.I think $0.006 should be safe . $0.005 not easy to get.Micros have favour with HGH leading.Let’s see whether they come along,btohqsg
Aiyah  change tactic lah  nothing to be shameful about.,btohqsg
Zero Covid policy my 1 year old kid also know it won't work,btohqsg
Imagine if you can control Zero policy on coughing  sneezing?  Not possible right?,btohqsg
But Xi has bet too much on zero-Covid to step back now  experts say.,btohqsg
Inflation will drive demand in consumer goods up to the point (say 60 per cent like in Turkey?) where very high inflation lead people to consider substitutes (unlikely) or just eliminate the said good from their consumption basket (likely). At hyperinflation  demand will revert and grow because by then  the local currency is worthless and consumers will just use USD or EUR or whatever.,btohqsg
Unfortunately economics is not a science so... Hard to say. Many idiosyncrasies,btohqsg
Tats wher interest hike comes in to fight inflation.,btohqsg
the economy theory I learn from the past is that in theory  inflation will drive up demand for consumer goods but that was 10-15 years ago. At the current inflation rate  I think it likely to have the reverse effect.,btohqsg
How to fight? Bank give you 1-2% higher interest but inflation at 8% or higher  still suffering 🤣,btohqsg
Reduce money flowin outside due to hike. Mainly ppl wil cut n only spend on main staple stuff,btohqsg
Hike will reach to a point wher it can fight inflation,btohqsg
But limit to hike too . Us won't shoot themselves on their own foot,btohqsg
Ya…especially with the huge debt they own  interest payment will be their downfall,btohqsg
Ya. Tink by next yr end  mayb inflation news gone lol,btohqsg
Malaysia coffeeshop everyone must order drinks  right?,btohqsg
No choice I no budget 😭,btohqsg
I remember go in want to try some food  they made us order drinks.,btohqsg
So far never happen to me...,btohqsg
ok  next time go malaysia pass me your photo 😜,btohqsg
Don't want lar... Don't want you to be blacklisted too...😝,btohqsg
Just joking. Last time I tried to save on drinks also. But during covid  we actually went to those coffeeshops at office areas and buy drinks from them when we pack food nearby. Very poor thing during covid  they hardly any biz. But recently $1.40 per drink I feel the pinch too,btohqsg
I hardly buy drink from kopi shop  do you know for $1.40 per drink  they earn $1.30,btohqsg
Drink is high profit margin item in F&B,btohqsg
Coffee shop drink stall best profit,btohqsg
That's why drink stall is always owner's biz,btohqsg
I just use a simple case  the same tin of can drink in Sheng Siong sold is $1 per can  at coffeeshop  they sold it at $2.10,btohqsg
Fruit juice best  say 1 pineapple cost $1.50  you can make 3 drinks that sell $3.30/cup,btohqsg
So drinks earn the most.You look at those Gong Cha  the margin is damn high,btohqsg
Better than fry a plate of noodle,btohqsg
Oops  I'm telling you all the trade stuff  bad me bad me.,btohqsg
My dad's old worker  she works in clothes retail  she told me their selling price is always 5x the cost.,btohqsg

2 condense milk buy jb rm 3.31 evaporated milk buy jb rm 3.31/2 Thai tea leaves per packet $4Per bottle cost me $0.2,btohqsg
This one I use I can do 20 bottles,btohqsg
Imagine I sell this price take some those shops selling $5-$7,btohqsg
How much they earn they more huat,btohqsg
Ya. If developer before complete project go bankrupt but already collected your bank or you took bank loan to buy you still hv to pay bank although property in limbo. Olden days singapore also like that but Govt corrected it but often happens in Malaysia. My friend said his condo developer changed hands at least 2-3 times  not only loss in property value in RM further s$-RM exchange loss.,btohqsg
Haha  Sam always so extreme - his characteristic. I take it as his joke now if not I go mad 😂😂😂,btohqsg
That's about right... 4x to 5x cost,btohqsg
Ya bcos habits are hard to change. Some may try or change to other brands that are cheaper but most won’t. This is more likely nett effect I think,btohqsg
👍👍 I mostly never. If hv soup I drink the free given soup. But now I cook n bring food from home like Sam  cheaper n more nutritious ☺️,btohqsg
Bcos it hurt her income but not you so smile at her 😂😂😂,btohqsg
He not pragmatic as our Govt. Stubborn to keep his face lah,btohqsg
But I go there to enjoy the food  not the sugar drinks... 😭,btohqsg
👍😂 personally I don’t think worth to drink outside bcos we all know how much crazy profit they make,btohqsg
Singapore cannot set our own interest rates.,btohqsg
Yes  take as a joke then don't feel so much negativity,btohqsg
Sam is so smart  cannot be as bad as he always jokes,btohqsg
Sam is actually a very nice guy but his postings so pessimistic 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Yes he is my very good friend ☺️,btohqsg
Yes  knowledgeable and willing to share,btohqsg
I agree. I told him he is so well read,btohqsg
His jokes are also very entertaining 😜,btohqsg
Alternatively u order the cheapest drink they have haha,btohqsg
Think is water or Chinese tea,btohqsg

OEL had prior accumulation before it went to flush out most retailers .With HGH running like that  high chance other micros will join the play and OEL is one candidate on the squeezed spring which can burst up any time to test $0.011 IMO.Recently they blocked $0.009  but if micro sentiments continue to remain bullish  the sellers will not block and play the momentum.Watch closely this week and pray pennies are in favour  especially micros.DYODD,btohqsg
Asiatic ($0.006) on the weekly- construction recovery is good this company- still NEO boss bought in at $0.008 last year Jan21 and became SSH  should not be for no reason.- this one have not yet been played up.
