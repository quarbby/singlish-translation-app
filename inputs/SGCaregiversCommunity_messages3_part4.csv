"The Public Bus Confidence Course (PBCC) jointly conducted by SPD and transport operator Tower Transit Singapore  is free and open to the public. It was launched last year to help people with mobility challenges regain their confidence in travelling on public buses.Course participants learn how to board and alight from a bus safely. Importantly  the psychological impact of acquiring a disability and becoming a wheelchair user  especially as an adult  isn‚Äôt glossed over.""People with disabilities(PwDs) are just like any other person. Despite what they have lost  they have a right to go and pursue whatever they want. Wheelchair users have equal rights to board the bus and they should not feel embarassed or feel that they are hindering other commuters.""Do you know of any individuals OR caregivers who would like to attend this course? Please do PM me@gregt18on Telegram or81261570via WhatsApp.The course will be conducted in the month of Nov' 2023 (the actual dates will be advice later).Course Length: 2 sessions (each session will be 1.5 hours)Course Fee: FOCVenue: To be Advice",btohqsg

Hi... Can dm me the details? Which agency  working hrs  paywise etc...,btohqsg
Yes! I used Active Global for ICS twice. Both were good as well. I think live-in caregivers would be a different calibre of caregivers from what I hear. ICS usually start out as live in caregivers  because they come into Singapore with FDW work permit.,btohqsg

Hi all  just found out about this dementia protection scheme that provides financialrelief in case the caregiver voluntarily ends his/her employment due to caregiving responsibilities  which is accurate in my case.the limit seems to be 65 years old unfortunately I can‚Äôt apply anymore  but it might not be too late for some of your care receipientshttps://dbs.chubbdigital.com/sg/dbs/pweb/dementiacaregiverprotect/,btohqsg

Heard homage gt no insurance covered for the workers if anytg happen to them,btohqsg
Plus we are one to one with client. Like.. for first time basis will b thrown in sea jus like tat,btohqsg
Homage sg has no insurance but homage Australia have insurance - no idea why,btohqsg
Yes. anyone parents from merdeka gen?,btohqsg
I suspect cos they have disability law. This mean if you have a condition  you still have the right to get insurance.,btohqsg
Yes  you're right.Pre-existing conditions are covered in insurance plans in Australia.I was studying there and working there and they have very comprehensive laws that protects people with health and disabilities,btohqsg
Really? I engaged with homage previously. They charged price increase to customer but unsure how much of the increase goes to worker. plus the workers get penalised for missing out client slots due to sickness. so I didn‚Äôt engage homage anymore,btohqsg
FYI. Can read more about Aus law. It apply to anyone with disability upon entry if you declared.Their level of human rights and quality of care is a lot more comprehensive than us. Yes they pay more tax but the health care quality is a lot better.,btohqsg
"Sometimes  you got to look at the financial market or the top. Do your investment analysis and theories. In SG  ¬£ is top of mind rather than doing what is ""right for customer"".",btohqsg
The business structure can see from financial annual report. Then you can make an informed decision. After all  it is still a business like it or not.Health care and insurance is a big part of our GDP expenses. Someone got to feed the machine especially with rising business cost. This is more of the concept of commondification of health care. Or profit for health care for their shareholders.,btohqsg
Regardless  always make an informed decision. Diversify your resources. Don't just see the brochure. Do your own research for the best interest beside the cost factor. There must be some value that you are willing to pay for especially if services are similar.,btohqsg
