What you say is right .. spend less on contract plan better. Sim no contract plan. 20 $ and below than pay 70 to 80$ on singtel contract plan. Well say Chris,btohqsg
Have our UOB account funds been earmarked already?,btohqsg
Not yet  by end of may,btohqsg
Hi anybody doing the Grab Challenge also?Need to hit $250 for online purchases.Apparently  Shopee can‚Äôt pay via Grab.Any platforms supports grabpay can share? üôè,btohqsg

Anyone know other then stashaway simple guaranteed and syfe cash guarantee what others are similar?,btohqsg
How does UOB PPV $1100 cap work?If I spend $600 that only earned 0.4mpdAnd then I spend another $1000 to try and get the 4mpd Does it only capture $500 for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi experts  can I tell the cashier to convert in-store purchase to online purchase for DBS woman‚Äôs world card?,btohqsg
If I am expecting to incur huge spending $20-30k on home appliances in the coming months  what is the best way to pay in installments  but still meet the minimum spending $2-3k cap to get rewards  regardless cash back or miles  on credit cards?My understanding is that for 0% instalment payment plans  they don‚Äôt qualify for spending cap,btohqsg
Cap only apply to 4mpd transaction,btohqsg
How u expecting them to convert for u then?,btohqsg
If merchant have buy now pay later options like atome,btohqsg
AF will be charged in subsequent month,btohqsg
After you fulfilled the spent of $500,btohqsg
Can you share what‚Äôs the maximum one can stretch in atome and the processing fee?,btohqsg
I dont use buy now pay later. U can read up on the bnpl option if merchant has one,btohqsg
I just called customer service dbs checked...Dbs world woman card.. only can be use online.  If I use it for contactless eg eating and shopping at OG physical stall  zara. Only get 0.4 miles.,btohqsg
Hi all  i need to make a downpayment for a car and they only accept bank transfer is there any to earn miles out of it?at the moment i know of citipayall and ipaymy but their admin fee is quite exp,btohqsg
The only credit card limits I know are:CitibankMax 5 cardsAmexMax 3 credit cardsMax 1 charge card,btohqsg
Like this need to call? Can just read from tnc,btohqsg
Since you need to pay for it regardless  why not just pay the admin fee and get the rewards? Rather than you pay the downpayment and not get anything. But you have to calculate if getting the rewards is worth to pay the fees,btohqsg
That guy doesn‚Äôt read or google themselves.,btohqsg
At the moment i can only use uob priv and per my cal each miles will have a valuation of 0.73 cents,btohqsg
I think Amex forgot to cancel one of my credit cards. They called me to ask which one I‚Äôd like to cancel when I applied for a new card. So 1 charge + 4 credit seems to be possible.,btohqsg
Because I need confirmation since some website say can   some say no,btohqsg
i managed to get a 6th Citi Credit Card long ago (when they were looser).But last year when I had 6 cards and wanted to apply for Prestige  they forced me to cancel 2 cards before they would approve Prestige. SighBut no regrets. Citi Prestige is one of my most valuable Miles card (alongside UOB Lady the Queen).,btohqsg
Power they allow you to have more than 2,btohqsg
Prestige card is quite similar to uob solitaire card. You don't earn 10k a month ... you don't get it,btohqsg
Is not like scb infinite card. Even you earn 30 to 35k .. you can get it,btohqsg
But prestige can get by depositing 10k  solitaire is 30k,btohqsg
That's another good point... but you put as secured.. I don't think you earn any bank interest,btohqsg
For UOB the last time my mom did it they allowed the promo FD rates,btohqsg
Yes... I think the website and terms and condition.. more safe than milelion and singsaver,btohqsg
Just requested AF waiver for my manhattan card through phone banking and successful! (Not a priority banking customer),btohqsg
hope i get mine too!! this card very important to keep,btohqsg
Tried apps not working then successful using automated phone banking.,btohqsg
Usually for high end cards are hard to waive annual fee.EgScb infinite card.Citi prestige card,btohqsg
Everything is on the MAS website,btohqsg
Which was the SG government security that must only be applied during office hours ah? Or has it been fixed already?I seem to be able to apply for both SSB and Tbills now at UOB Desktop Banking even though it is a Saturday today.,btohqsg
oh ... so if weekdays  it is still constrained by a certain timing?,btohqsg
Should be 7am-9pm if I recall,btohqsg
thanks very much.. i usually do on weekdays myself during office hours so never had issue  but i need to check out for a friend who can only do it at night.. so before 9pm then.CHEERS!,btohqsg
anyone here apply cimb credit card via phone banking notification telling you that the cashback upsize to $300?,btohqsg
Not bad.  I don't mind consider cashback if they give free $$$.,btohqsg
