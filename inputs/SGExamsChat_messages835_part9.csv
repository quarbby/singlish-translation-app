now no  only buona to JE,btohqsg
oh then the shuttle thing ah,btohqsg
but two days ago it was bridged over a longer distance,btohqsg
but i hate to say that should be normalized in the event of such disrupt and that a backup plan that gets put into action last minute,btohqsg
now the MRT shuttle train bridges boon lay and jurong east,btohqsg
not a big problem  except it 3-4x the usual waiting time,btohqsg
east side losers such as me be like,btohqsg
at least those near to EWL's east side,btohqsg
then there's me travelling paya lebar to boon lay,btohqsg
LOL today I did bugis to lakeside,btohqsg
bugis -> outram park bc fsr train service ended outram park,btohqsg
then buona -> JE shuttle bus,btohqsg
i just grabhitched ahead of time,btohqsg
mind you it's all the same green line,btohqsg
bc i scared got any delays,btohqsg
i think how smrt handled it,btohqsg
tbf it's baffling that they kept a 1st gen train around,btohqsg
Th only reason why this derailment was such a prob was because the detailed train damaged tracks,btohqsg
afaik trains if maintained properly can last v long,btohqsg
There were 2 seperate cases of derailment before  one was a controller error  the other was faulty train,btohqsg
1997 a Maintenance train derailed in the tunnel along toa payoh and in 2014  two carriages under testing derailed at Bishan Depot to be specifc,btohqsg
i hate that shit like this happens in sg and thrs like no transparency as to how they're gna improve or anything like that,btohqsg
If you look at the SMRT CEO comments from the 1997 incident  you can see the stark contrast in difference of how derailments are handled,btohqsg
"The most potent example is how they used ""derailment"" in the newspapers",btohqsg
The shift from being transparent to the public has definitely been shifted,btohqsg
that wasn't really the main issue(the way the gov department LTA & SMRT) handling the aftermath incident in such a way that people found major issues when seeing this matter on a deeper level (detailed)to which you've answered me time to type out what's the more major concern,btohqsg
Guys n lvl is elmab3 right?,btohqsg
actually its fixing the tracks  specifically the third rail in order to restore power to trains between Jurong East and Bouna vistathe train is not on a active line which could hinder services there is still a depot in tuas where trains can be sent if servicing is needed since the current train derailment has blocked the ulu pandan depot from being usable,btohqsg
so it's mainly the rail that's the problem?,btohqsg
is it just that part of the track  or across the whole map?,btohqsg
part of the track  thats why they only shut off the portion of track after bouna vista and resume operations after jurong east station,btohqsg
it's EMAB2 (EL + MA + best 2),btohqsg
But my prelim results show emb3 aggregate,btohqsg
The main thing they have to do now is to fix the parts of tracks broken along the route from Bouna vista to Jurong east.Then after  fix and restore the power of the third rail.,btohqsg
EMBA3 N(A) version which works on the same level as L1R4,btohqsg
