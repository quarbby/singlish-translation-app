Someone explain to me the bell curve,btohqsg
I heard youâ€™re not guaranteed an A1 if you get 75% and above,btohqsg
There's not really a bell curve for national exams but there's something called 'moderation'. If paper easy grade thresholds shift up. Paper hard shift down,btohqsg
After marking all the scripts  if the examiners feel that compared to last year  the performance of candidates have improved  distinction and pass rates will increase,btohqsg
So actually there's not really a bell curve since the percentage of students awarded each grade is not fixed,btohqsg
Nah they are not suppose to do that,btohqsg
i wont be surprised if it happens anyways,btohqsg
