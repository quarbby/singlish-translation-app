We died out? In what world?,btohqsg
Personally  I'd appreciate if we stopped talking about this because:1) Talking about them gives them free advertisement 2) Flaming other groups/people just makes this a negative place for everyone and detracts from the purpose of this group 3) Those comments are clearly trying to provoke a reaction and we shouldn't give them the satisfaction.That being said  you should still PM the admins if you get added without consent and update your settings so that only your contacts can add you.,btohqsg
Okay okay. I understand where you are coming from. I'll stop,btohqsg
It's not your fault tbh  most people's initial reaction is to be pissed and talk about it here,btohqsg
But at some point we are doing exactly what the admin of the other group wants,btohqsg
I'll just wait for other comments to push everything up,btohqsg
I didn't know what the other group was about they kept adding me into useless stuff,btohqsg
