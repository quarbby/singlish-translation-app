Wow I did not know you buy to aim for such ego. Haha,btohqsg

Dont know what to buy also....GKE suits me....so i ok with it,btohqsg

I see. But by your logic many stocks also we don‚Äôt know will reach what high price what,btohqsg
But you are the micro Penny specialist lah üòÜ,btohqsg
No ones will know but if the coy got prospects...I think can GROW...which penny keep on sharebuybacks 500lot everyday,btohqsg
Everyday GKE spend 40k to sharebuybacks..1 week already 200k le,btohqsg
When company do sharebuybacks  it is a sign of their business confidence as they want to reduce their number of issued shares.,btohqsg
I wish you all the best,btohqsg
So at end of day  Coy ROE% will be high when there less number of issued shares,btohqsg
Today market so dead. Sleepy üò¥,btohqsg
Should pay off if you can hold. Good chance I reckon.,btohqsg
Everyday GKE EPS and ROI will go up by a small margin...due to sharebuybacks,btohqsg
This show GKE is very concerned for their shareholders due to they supporting their shareprices,btohqsg
At end day  they want their both stakeholder shareholder happy,btohqsg
Whoever decides to buy GKE  best is have the holding power. BBs very patient.Hard to time their move this one ‚òùÔ∏è,btohqsg
Cloudy outlook...1 word uncertainty..not too sure how temasek going integrate it,btohqsg

MT Taiwan break support @50.. (closed @47 TWD  2.19SGD).. sigh...,btohqsg
Took a drive last Friday to see their activity at their logistics hub. They are definitely much busier than when I visited 1.5 years back.I Guess rise in e-commerce have helped their business a lot   which explains the turnaround in their latest Financial year making almost 5 million from more than 100 million turnover as compared to the past 3 years losses.Really positive for me. Good luck to all GKE holders,btohqsg
Very nice uptrend with ascending triangle. Could be big move coming. Also based on the volume spikes  can see the volume ascending too on each buy spike up. Chart looking solid,btohqsg
Hahhaha  was in the area so went to survey üòé,btohqsg
But if MT Taiwan keep dropping  hard for MT Singapore to go up  even though there is a price disparity ($1.28 in Singapore vs  $2.19 in Taiwan)...,btohqsg
Great i bought ix already. Waiting for the day it rise.,btohqsg
They dun buy everyweek. Mayb once a week,btohqsg
They supporting the price...if they got hit then will annouce,btohqsg
Huh  they don't help the businesses doing badly but extend even more help to businesses that are doing well?,btohqsg

Maybe tomorrow continues drop like durian   like durian once drop continues for 3 days,btohqsg
Dun care so much of TW  why worry of TW Med tmr,btohqsg
1.3 buys are weak at the moment  bid vol for 1.29 needs to grow,btohqsg
