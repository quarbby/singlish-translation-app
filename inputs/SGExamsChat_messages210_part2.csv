Study hard can rekt bell curve easily one,btohqsg
Since I free now  i talk a bit about this.NUS is flexible with students opting for double major/degrees(except for certain cases like food sci/pharmacy). So lets say you enter NUS as a single degree student  and you want to apply to take a double major/degree  it is definitely possible  but must do so by the end of Year 2 if I'm not wrong.For me right now  I'm only studying Chem  but let's say I want to study life science as a second major  it is possible to do so  but need to declare by end of Year 2.,btohqsg
