The only way they know that this particular phone number is tied to a potential person of interest for their surveys can only mean they know your details,btohqsg
just bc i feel it doesn't mean its true,btohqsg
The president and vp phone is online,btohqsg
Fun man  next time you work for the govt...you rise to high. Your phone number gonna end up on a international website,btohqsg
at that point u wld also be given allowance for a work phone/work number,btohqsg
but no legit  this was my first time hearing it,btohqsg
I think ya  idk also I see everyone buying durian,btohqsg
so you get one for urself too,btohqsg
nah last month I bought 1k rmb worth already,btohqsg
Ok thatâ€™s expensive. Looks like some variety thatâ€™s not from Malaysia,btohqsg
In Singapore during the peak season can get MSW grade A durians for maybe $15-$22/kg,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever seen them in Singapore,btohqsg
hmmmm price around 10k per 100g,btohqsg
Also many unscrupulous durian sellers would try to upsell Thai durians as Malaysia durians when Malaysia durians are not in season,btohqsg
Rn it's easier to export to SG than China,btohqsg
Cuz we can just do it by truck,btohqsg
Yeah unfortunately so thatâ€™s why we can get it relatively cheap,btohqsg
What breed isit? Or isit like the local variety.,btohqsg
Ok then the price is not bad assuming the durians are about as decent as the cheap Malaysia varieties,btohqsg
Cheap Malaysia varieties as in stuff like Kampong or lower end durians that have a cultivar number (so durians like D1  D13),btohqsg
The malaysia varieties are very pungent tho which is what SG market likes,btohqsg
Yeah because unlike Thai they wait for them to drop to the ground,btohqsg
Thai durians can be nice if harvested from the ground,btohqsg
Or just made up names like Red Prawn Black Pearl or Sultan King,btohqsg
Bruh u have no idea the joy of having a bitter durian,btohqsg
There's like a whole spectrum of flavours from Durian Sweet Bitter Numb some and different fruity notes like some can have an alcoholic aftertaste as well,btohqsg
Red prawn=D175  Black Pearl aka Taiyuan=?  Sultan king=D24,btohqsg
Those are the lower end to middle tier varieties,btohqsg
Black Pearl Iâ€™m not sure what cultivar number it is,btohqsg
Some like D13 are just referred like that while the colloquial name is popular as a description of the fruit itself,btohqsg
I donâ€™t know how the D13 got the johor red prawn name,btohqsg
When red prawn was actually meant to be for another cultivar,btohqsg
Red Prawn if I remember correctly has a distinct slightly red hue to the flesh and the seed is massive and round,btohqsg
Red prawn is a bit more pinkish-orangish  may not be as sweet and more bitter,btohqsg
Either ways usually D13 is priced lower than Red Prawn when I look at it in most seasons,btohqsg
D13 is always those small ones which probably makes sense why it's always the cheap one,btohqsg
Possibly but also there can be quite big D13s  I think maybe itâ€™s because the seed tends to be bigger and the taste doesnâ€™t feel as complex so people feel that itâ€™s inferior to D175,btohqsg
D175 the seed alr massive af liao imo,btohqsg
I still think for the classic full bite of a durian only MSW can provide,btohqsg
D175 I thought even with the bigger seed ones the meat not as thin,btohqsg
D175 more likely to have that bitter taste also,btohqsg
Yeah red prawn got chance for a more nuance taste that ppl like which is why the price is always higher than D13,btohqsg
Business ppl  Amazon is a source of passive income for Jeff bezos right,btohqsg
Cause he earns money through the companies that advertise or sell their products on the platform,btohqsg
And he gets a portion of the profit from it,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Another day  another rp pred fr,btohqsg
