You compared to last year when no covid how to compare sia,btohqsg
Wah... MT must guarantee baby go uni,btohqsg
Q to Q got 1000x ma?,btohqsg
If supply over demand then how?,btohqsg
Q2 to q3 like not so fantastic,btohqsg
It trades at 813m sgd market cap.They have stated 4Q as a record quarter. So conservatively speaking 3Q is 45m so if 4Q is the same we look at full year of 129m usd or 175m sgdSo based on this figure it trades at a Pe of 4.6And an underestimate of 4Q results. Could be looking PE 3-4,btohqsg
Very good 1115 times compare to Q3 last year,btohqsg
Can't compare to last year la,btohqsg
Hahahahaha yah hahahahaha but then i delete üòπüòπ,btohqsg
Fast hands   good for trading üòâ,btohqsg

See you guys on mars tmrwü§≠,btohqsg
I want to see 100% green profit in my portfolio,btohqsg
Jerry don't be a shortist la,btohqsg
Many BBs bought in these 2 days. So  uptrend is the way to go,btohqsg
Hmm no comment.. I won't short.. Just asking for opinion,btohqsg
Once hit 1.6 i change my name back liao,btohqsg
Mt buy on rumour sell on news?,btohqsg
This one come out I think all exit le,btohqsg
Just buy MT and stop asking,btohqsg

Okay la! You win I win everybody Win,btohqsg
Si ma lu Guan Yin Ma say this Friday is the week,btohqsg

Tomorrow have to see the different groups in play for MT.,btohqsg
Quarter to quarter TG perform better than MT in % right?,btohqsg
TG biggest gloves maker lehHow to fight,btohqsg
Take some reference got TG price action if u all wanna jeep more,btohqsg
If only we can take a peep at how big is the backlog and how efficient they are is driving down  I also don‚Äôt know their debt level hence play with caution for me personally üò¨,btohqsg
But isn't this the results all expected?,btohqsg
UG MT STA all just chiong UP,btohqsg
I vested in all these 3 also,btohqsg
Ya.. Maybe same as TG pattern..,btohqsg
Nvm u play only few pip,btohqsg
Both also want to win the fight,btohqsg
Realistic la.. We must learn abit from TG..,btohqsg
Q1Revenue 39 811Gross profit 7 154Net profit 3 672Q2Revenue 122 798Gross profit 44 268Net profit 35 221Q3Revenue 124 591Gross profit 65 463Net profit 45 742,btohqsg
Nothing to bet la friendly discussion only,btohqsg
But the LM want to win then personal attack,btohqsg
Expect full year USD120m  or Eps 32 sg cts. PE 5 times is $1.60.But for tomor  not very sure the sp movement. This earnings is good but not the 'surprise' u get in Q2.,btohqsg
MT 2019 NET PROFOT $41 ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
anyway  tml we shall see ah we dk what will happen too,btohqsg
Jerry rmb u say vp gonna fly when result come?,btohqsg
Don't remind him of his painful story,btohqsg
You say got pap support hor,btohqsg
Ppl also gambling with mt ain't it,btohqsg
Walao tonight must call Vickers again to raise sell limit,btohqsg
Yesterday spent 1h waiting to get on the line,btohqsg
Glann you still holding MT right,btohqsg
If my mental sums are correct,btohqsg
"‚ÄúWith long-term indicative orders in hand and stabilizing raw material prices  the Company expects to report record revenue and profit in the fourth quarter and financial year ending 31 December 2020.""",btohqsg
Anyone realized q3 revenue up by the same amount(6 mil) as q3 profit?,btohqsg
Maybe can expect a 55m Q4,btohqsg
if MT gap down tmr also like RS and TG  means subsequent medical stocks will cheong before results  after results gap down?,btohqsg
Not all behave same way but can take reference loh,btohqsg
Mt won‚Äôt GAp down  but I am not sure whether there will be big sell down,btohqsg
MT Not like TG or RS,btohqsg
Talk now is useless  watch tomorrow morning show,btohqsg
For me I have zero expectations  lesser disappointment in the morning.,btohqsg
No pt debating now. Let e market do e talkin,btohqsg
Many small traders just take up the positions to bet on the results. So  tomor there bound to be more sellers. But how the BB go be more important afterwards,btohqsg
Bet tomorrow if drop  whole chat will be ‚Äúwhy MT down?‚Äù,btohqsg
MT won‚Äôt have big sell down .MT holder seem more unite.if drop then top up.If up then hold n chiong x3.$2 in sight,btohqsg
People will  be more optimistic if not for what happened to TG,btohqsg
Tomorrow sure many contra sell off,btohqsg
Just brace for the down then up again,btohqsg
Looks like they manage lower their cost  maximize their profit  if compare to previous quarter,btohqsg
when you know the brain and the heart fight  and the brain won,btohqsg
Hope I can sell into strength also,btohqsg
Tomorrow once gap up I dump all,btohqsg
short calculation based on 9 months,btohqsg
Everybody thought it will fly too,btohqsg
Yea. Based on the p/e. Its considered bad,btohqsg
Long term I see it continue up,btohqsg
MT one is like crazy gd. We are looking at p/e of ard 5 based on current price,btohqsg
Like SgYuan mentioned yesterday  don‚Äôt hold for targets like 2.88 3.88 etc. manage your expectations and Tp accordingly.Reduce exposure and fight the rest when reach your own TP,btohqsg
A lot of MT holders.. Can't comment much,btohqsg
TG has scale  without covid  it is still a good company,btohqsg
Just wish u all good luck,btohqsg
After q2 results. Medtecs Cheong to high of 1.98. now price only 1.48 and Q3 better then q2 results. Q4 will be even better.,btohqsg
Yup q3 & q2 revenue similar but profit margins improved,btohqsg
Yea ppl might sell based on past experience,btohqsg
Sell button on each own hand.. No need too much comment,btohqsg
MT  is really wtf.it is producing beyond its capacity,btohqsg
Result is good... But still within the expected range (maybe upper range). I doubt there will be gap up on opening tomor. Wish u the best.,btohqsg
i think it will be  sell and buy up,btohqsg
Let market do the talking la,btohqsg
Anyway went up from 1.2 to 1.5,btohqsg
good news   so rejoice any way :),btohqsg
today just pause breather. nvr doji means tomorrow only 2 ways.retrace flush to 144 collect more or straight into heaven 1.78,btohqsg
More of increase its selling price,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt look like they increase their price but lower their cost,btohqsg
With long-term indicativeorders in hand and stabilizing raw material prices  the Company expects to report recordrevenue and profit in the fourth quarter and financial year ending 31 December 2020.,btohqsg
Now 3 schools1st school... Still holding  so see results spectacular... expect gap up tomor.2nd school...taken profit today. See result in line with expectation. Expect some profit taking.3rd school....the doubters who never buy.... wa results so so only... Tomor sure down.,btohqsg
Ok la make senses cos $6m vs Q3 2020,btohqsg
I reckon gap up tmr. But from there up or down  question mark,btohqsg
Need to see how evil is the BB,btohqsg
""" With long-term indicative orders in hand and stabilizing raw material prices  the Company expects to report record revenue and profit in the fourth quarter and financial year ending 31 December 2020.""",btohqsg
i think their account see money until hand tremble,btohqsg
Next year their staff bonus should be thick,btohqsg
The impt para is the 2nd last.,btohqsg
Expects record revenue and profit in last quarter,btohqsg
Strait times/BT plays a big part tmr,btohqsg
hopefully some institution sees the potential and says i want this company then confirm fly,btohqsg
Comparing the pe itself against the market pe  I think it‚Äôs not reasonable to trade at such low price,btohqsg
based on 9 months ar the PE,btohqsg
i think no need say so much  tomorrow market never move  then i will be laughing. all dont know what to do haha,btohqsg
i am still very happy that Medtecs keep performing better,btohqsg
if i am the employee  i confirm super happy with big fat bonus,btohqsg
Just realise MT Q3 profit is 3x more than UG 1H2020. If UG can $3  MT deserve more !!,btohqsg
Very happy that at this point of time  there are people‚Äôs that can generate income.Give yourself a big pat.,btohqsg
Sghuat got 10k member now? Wow,btohqsg
but the people here like more chatty,btohqsg

A lot of ppl from this channel are there too,btohqsg
Only the CEO still smiling to the bank.,btohqsg
Lols haven't release result drop to 1 dollar,btohqsg
Just checkedUG 614m sharesMT 549m shares,btohqsg
Now also depend on EPS üòÜ,btohqsg
