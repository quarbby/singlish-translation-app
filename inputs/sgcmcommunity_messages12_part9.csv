What do we do then  just an endless cycle at that point  what's needed is road etiquette for this case and the concept of giving way,btohqsg
Will hit 3%by this year easily,btohqsg
Gonna put a lot of pressure. Expect coe the o fall,btohqsg
Our country is not give way but to speed up,btohqsg
I also heard the PM Lee said that recession is coming   hence there might be no reason to implement the 110kmh speed limit as this will cause people to burn more petrol hence effecting economy once again.,btohqsg
excatly sadly like this hard to increase limit haha,btohqsg
Cars now a days driving at 110Km is also below 2 k rpm,btohqsg
if limit is 110 and people dont give way its a recipe for accidents,btohqsg
I am inclined to agree with you Mr Arnav. What measure do you think can be implemented? SkilsFuture lesson on road etiquette?,btohqsg
Just driver behavior  increasing speed limit will not solve it,btohqsg
I propose penalize the road joggers till they change to slow lane to become habits,btohqsg
Nope the middleLane won’t travel that fast,btohqsg
And it is easy to cut,btohqsg
if they are people pushing 100 nowadays hard to say uh boss,btohqsg
This is a very good idea. Maybe can propose to Government,btohqsg
Haha. So true. They think you want to chase them,btohqsg
No wonder so many people selling,btohqsg
U did not notice that now hard to overtake is because overtaking lane is the same speeed as the lorry in the middle lane ?,btohqsg
They think giving way is lesser behavior,btohqsg
Will write to my MP. thks. Rgrds.,btohqsg
If overtaking lane is at 110 it is easy to overtake the middle lane,btohqsg
The whole issue is that people will continue to stick to lane 1 and drive at the speed limit instead of giving way,btohqsg
Noted on the support given. Will do the same with me MP too. Best regards.,btohqsg
You increase to 110  people want to go 130 in lane 1  endless cycle,btohqsg
But it is easy to over take   and don’t need to over take at 1110,btohqsg
end up singapore will become autobahn haha,btohqsg
Dont we all love CTE to be our next NSHW?,btohqsg
but cannot control people mah some people confirm leg itchy will overtake above 110 :(,btohqsg
U look at Malaysia also is at 110 most sg driver enjoy driving there,btohqsg
If overtaking lane is 110  middle lane is also 110,btohqsg
Actually Subaru Forester is very solid car and reliable. They’ve won many awards in reliability in America. I tested this car many many years ago on behalf of a buyer who wanted to buy. Suspension feel is great. I wonder why not reliable today,btohqsg
most sg drivers enjoy cos they go above 110 hahahaha,btohqsg
Cause 80-90 is really too low,btohqsg
Is it because many years ago?,btohqsg
Beg to differ  can see lorries and hiace driving at 110 at many times,btohqsg
This I never see 99% of the time,btohqsg
Most of them is 70-80 plus,btohqsg
Malaysia highways relatively empty  especially the ones most SG drivers are on. Singapore is a smaller country less room more cars,btohqsg
I have seen way too many EJ engine blowing up  not sure about you tho,btohqsg
More cars using the same stretches everyday also,btohqsg
I see alot of cars at ecp going at 200,btohqsg
Yes. At least ten years ago. It was very good. Wrx Forrestor all solid machines,btohqsg
With higher speed can reduce the congestion at peak period,btohqsg
yes i agree wrx is solid car,btohqsg
My friend had a wrx and he let me drive for a while it’s very comfortable to drive. Good daily driver,btohqsg
did you like the fuel consumption?,btohqsg
The suspension feelIs very good. Rock solid build too,btohqsg
If everyone at higher speeds  all moving together mate,btohqsg
The issue is giving way and driving etiquette not speeds,btohqsg
cannot control some people who will cut in and out mah,btohqsg
