Bro thought he can run when in admin logs can still find the messages,btohqsg
Just hang a few days. U will see learning smart ways to earn from bank better than u promote funny stuff let people scold only. Be good ok?,btohqsg
Yeap should have done that earlier  it is to help clients overseas to apply for entry visa. Those clients will only stay for around a week for holidays,btohqsg
Hi can I ask if let say I open a new UOB one account and desposit 100k in aug  so I need to wait three months in order to receive the interest after I satisfy the conditions to receive bonus interest in aug?,btohqsg
No ah.1. Earmark reward given shortly after earmark2. Monthly you will get the bonus interest due based on account type,btohqsg
Where else can i stash my cash,btohqsg
Money market fund  T bills  CIMB Fastsaver etc,btohqsg
Earmark is only 30th of the mth?,btohqsg
Any way to use paynow using credit card?,btohqsg
Shucks should have put my money elsewhere until 29th :(,btohqsg
From my memory based on my last few participations about 15th of the month after deadline u will get earmarked.,btohqsg
Thanks. I am looking at uob one account satisfying the min 500 spend and three giro transactions cause I am self employed so no salary credit,btohqsg
Transferring from dbs using fast sal counts. Ocbc paynow SALA apparently also counts,btohqsg
Thank you. But I am fully self employed  and I heard that uob savings account are best for self employed workers. That‚Äôs why I am considering to switch. Previously I was Ocbc 360,btohqsg
Yup  just saying the salary credit works even from your own account,btohqsg
That's why uob one is best for self employed. Because it allows paynow/fast to qualify as salary credit  not just giro,btohqsg
How you achieve OCBC 360 salary credit requirements since you are self employed? Can share with us?,btohqsg
See. The first trick u can learn here is being mentioned above Liao.,btohqsg
Success is subjective. It depends on your objective in life. You can watch some of Chris' videos on his own thoughts  one of them is about why he no longer chase financial freedom.https://youtu.be/cchaBa5MGbM,btohqsg
Does it work the same way for ocbc too? Like I used DBS to fast transfer to ocbc 360 and indicated as ‚ÄòSAL‚Äô?,btohqsg
Ocbc seems smarter. Cannot cheat them,btohqsg
Ocbc only accept giro and paynow corporate,btohqsg
Is it smarter of ocbc or of uob that all the self employed people bank with them instead,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think they are profitable paying 5%pa on $100k.,btohqsg
Hmm I wonder how sustainable it is for them too,btohqsg
But they probably lending out at a higher interest?,btohqsg
Credit card interest  lending to companies etc.,btohqsg
Previously I was employed with salary credit. But now no more hence thinking of switching to UOB.,btohqsg
Oic. Thanks for reply. üòÄ. Many people are looking for method to fulfil ocbc salary credit requirement.,btohqsg
I have transferred all my gxs $$ into poems.. godspeed,btohqsg
Me too haha. That‚Äôs why I decide to switch üòÖ,btohqsg
Not the same products. Cannot compare savings account with mmf.,btohqsg
Just check have you received Ocbc 360 Jul bonus interest in early Aug? I still have not received  not sure miss out anything.,btohqsg
Not really leh. It‚Äôs the median.But as Chris said. Median is the 51th person in 101 people.And median age is 44 years old.Quite believable stats.,btohqsg
Hello. Can i check does UOB Ladies card - travel category include purchase of travel insurace?If no  can i use amaze + citi for online transaction?,btohqsg
Travel insurance under mcc code 6300. You can check is it in the exclusion list on both cards.,btohqsg
actually i read the tnc of UOB one account. It says salary credited via FAST is excluded.,btohqsg
Not sure anyone calculated. Assuming existing cimb fast saver have abt $100 reference funds. Is it more worth to keep 75k in gxs till 31 aug or move to cimb from 17th aug (assuming cimb use daily average balance calculation..roughly 75k/2 balance @3.5%),btohqsg
you don't shift now. Sekali GXS pull some shenanigans closer to 17 Aug or CIMB terminate signups early. then gg.,btohqsg
"That said  i noticed for the cimb promotion  you need to ""sign up"" via the cimb automated whatsapp. Like the moomoo promo like that",btohqsg
anyway the difference over 10 days is 41 cents in favor of CIMB. any daily compounding of 41 cents over 10 days is negligible. I rather transfer now and not wait for GXS to do anything funny,btohqsg
I just activated the cimb promo via whatsapp,btohqsg
But how do they know how to tie back to my account. Via my phone number?,btohqsg
Probably. Your WhatsApp number and bank phone number is the same right,btohqsg
Yes. Hopefully it is registered. I dont see any confirmation,btohqsg
I mean apart from the whatsapp  there is no email confirmation or notifications from cimb clicks,btohqsg
Not that high with bonus  aws and CPF factored in,btohqsg
I got my bonus interest last 3 mths using that method. Can also see sethisfy article on this. Not the only person to do it this way,btohqsg
My zym app indicate that the number successfully port over Liao but when call to the number it says ‚Äúnot in use‚Äù . Any idea how long have to wait ?,btohqsg
Confirm that on the app it's showing your original number instead of the temp number? This morning my number ported just fine.,btohqsg
