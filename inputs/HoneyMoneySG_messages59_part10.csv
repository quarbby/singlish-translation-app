"Why not take out today? Seems like a hard deadline. GXS is only 3.48%  CIMB is 3.5%.""8. If Customers meet the qualifying criteria stipulated in these terms  Customers will earn a flat interest/profit rate of 3.50% p.a. (inclusive of prevailing rate) on their incremental fresh funds balance in the Qualifying Account(s) for the first 6 calendar months starting from 1 August 2023 to 31 January 2024 (“Bonus Interest/Profit Earning Period”).""",btohqsg
Existing customer incremental value is based on 30th July. At least according to tnc on the website,btohqsg
Existing customers is compare against Reference Month,btohqsg
They illustrated the same table for existing customer,btohqsg
Am deciding whether which 2 banks should I park my money UOB or DBS,btohqsg
Do you fulfill the UOB one account requirements. If yes then UOB one has highest effective rate of 5% at 100k,btohqsg
actually not much difference but GXS 3.48% per day is like 3.54% pa so probably will wait till 17 August 0030H zero out once the last interest is in,btohqsg
How is reference month decided? I realize I have a fast saver acc because I signed up for FD earlier in January,btohqsg
<_< I personally put dbs as my salary crediting account  use posb cashback (which gives interest regardless of account value) and keep my DBS account value below 10k,btohqsg
Because UOB can use DBS to pay SAL to your UOB one account,btohqsg
existing user for CIMB - Incremental fresh funds balance refers to comparing end-day-balance on that day against that of 31 July '23.,btohqsg
For employed.. ideally use uob one with 100k since the criterias are easy. If got another 100k can put ocbc 360 with your salary credited. But make sure increasing balance 500.,btohqsg
ALL EXISTING customers are fixed 31st July 2023 day end balance,btohqsg
Ohh if my current balance as at 31st July is $20 then if I put in 10k and maintain it till the 3.5% promo ends  I’ll get in bonus interest of $10k-$20?,btohqsg
eh it doesn't make sense la... whoever wrote the TNC of the CIMB promo.. how can it be based on Month-end balance.. then i just last day bring in BIG BIG money i get full month bonus/interest?,btohqsg
Yup can. Tried and tested. <_< I would move to OCBC 360 if I could but my mortgage with DBS. So more worth it still for me to stay with DBS,btohqsg
Can use personal DBS account to credit “Salary” to UOB one account to fulfill the UOB salary credit criteria?,btohqsg
Can. I think articles online also wrote about it before.,btohqsg
Can. 24hrs will update alrdy your uob,btohqsg
Must use FAST and select SAL payment,btohqsg
Ocbc can salary credit to uob also but only using paynow option,btohqsg
I think interest is calculated daily hahaha but you probably have to check with the bank about the details,btohqsg
That was what I was thinking too  it’s strange. Shouldn’t it be ADB for July.,btohqsg
Wow okok I’ll give it a shot thanks mate,btohqsg
I am pretty sure it is a typo and they will be applying 3.5% bonus interest on[(Average Monthly Balance) - Reference Month] * 3.5% p.a. / 12 = Monthly Interest,btohqsg
How do I choose a good miles credit card for general spending?,btohqsg
10. Incremental Fresh Funds Balance refers to comparing end-day-balance on that day against thatof 31 July 2023 (“Comparison Month End-Day Balance”). For example: the daily end-of-daybalance is compared against the Comparison Month End-Day Balance until the end of theBonus Interest/Profit Earning Period.#10 tries hard to explain but confuses it further,btohqsg
General spending will be uob privi only 1.4 miles per dollar in $5 dollar spending block,btohqsg
For ocbc 360 salary criteria. Is it possible for paynow transfer and select salary will meet ocbc salary criteria ?,btohqsg
i think what it is trying to express in failed english isCIMB will compare the DAILY End of Day balance in subsequent months against the 31st July End of Day Balance... in computing the 3.5% p.a.,btohqsg
But if they don't clarify soon  I expect loads of complains from jokers who keep their CIMB balance at $1k.. then last day of the month move in $200k for a day.. and expect 3.5% p.a. for the whole month on $200k,btohqsg
those jokers are expecting 3.5% x 30 = 105% p.a.,btohqsg
OCBC is as of now  quite strict. Only giro,btohqsg
Hopefully they change it soon haha a lot of employers use paynow for salary now,btohqsg
Oh really ah  has anyone tried the paynow thing for ocbc. Tried last time and it didn't work,btohqsg
Does anyone know ifl I can get 4mpd if I use UOB preferred platinum cc to pay my dental bill payment via health buddy app?,btohqsg
no lah  this is online. mcc 8099 not under whitelisted online mcc for 10x points,btohqsg
How about if I use UOB privi miles cc? Will I get 4mpd?,btohqsg
1.4mpd yes. can use dbs wwmc or citi rewards for 4mpd,btohqsg
"actually no idea what is ""paynow via giro""",btohqsg
Do Degree Holders really earn $8 190/Month in Singapore?https://youtu.be/JlXBSOsEbcg,btohqsg
Meaning they simply can’t lent out the $ in,btohqsg
PayNow via GIRO is under PayNow Corporate,btohqsg
If anyone managed to do this maybe can share for the benefit of all the OCBC 360 account holders,btohqsg
Ocbc tr also have white list of merchants name,btohqsg
Probably their IT plan for stress test that their system able to handle big withdrawals on 18th,btohqsg
no lah mcc 4812 no 3mpd,btohqsg
