i mean sosci/lit even at a uni level is always questioned on its “usefulness” and practicality,btohqsg
and those who did i only know one or two who got into loca u,btohqsg
which imho is damn waste money + ur degree from james cook uni gon mean way less than nus degree lul,btohqsg
and i think poly hones in more on that practical side of courses,btohqsg
so i cant afford private uni,btohqsg
thats why i think think think,btohqsg
do i rlly wanna do lit? so i chose sosci instead,btohqsg
idk about your sample size but different people think differently la,btohqsg
i don’t agree with that mindset either but it’s their life lor,btohqsg
like for me if you don’t have a degree your career is gonna hit a ceiling fast,btohqsg
and then theres ppl who drop out of sec sch,btohqsg
yea but like in my friend group there’s equal poly and jc people,btohqsg
comes down to the individual mindset and how far you’re really looking into the future,btohqsg
to determine what you wanna do,btohqsg
What if i drop out of ntu and start a chicken rice store'Chicken rice hawker store opened by ex ntu student',btohqsg
This is the harsh reality of Singapore  straight from MOM’s reporting,btohqsg
EE grad tho not drop out,btohqsg
he just did what he wanted,btohqsg
154 thousand degree holders earn more than 12k a month.14 thousand diploma holders do.If you intend to live comfortably and well  statistically I think a degree is a clear choice in Singapore.Unless you don’t need much to survive and you’re happy with earning less but often doing work that is just as hard or only slightly less challenging  finish the degree.,btohqsg
one of the imo dumbest (or ig uninformed/naive) posts i’ve read was someone saying they’re dropping out of uni cos learning it in sch is killing his passion,btohqsg
I mean it might be valid for that person  but I think many people who do drop out have not really hit the requirement to be able to conclude they can’t make it,btohqsg
Even if you’re very deeply distressed  take an LOA,btohqsg
I went to the hospital and it destroyed my GPA but I still graduated on time so  that’s my take on it,btohqsg
i forgot what else was said exactly  but stuck out to me was basically saying why get a degree and kill your passion when he can get the same skills learning on his own at his own pace,btohqsg
which just showed his lack of understanding of how things work,btohqsg
I am struggling w mech sigh,btohqsg
There is somewhere I did wrongly.,btohqsg
Degrees are just “Proof of Work” like how bitcoin works hahaha  it’s a terrible proxy for value addition at work but it’s the best we have,btohqsg
i’ve also commonly seen many people lose passion when going through uni  and tbh a lot of times their passion was just nvr that strong to begin with,btohqsg
or they realise what work actually goes into a field,btohqsg
Why do we even grind in the first place like bye bye mental stability,btohqsg
and then if not AAA then bye bye hopes n dreams,btohqsg
Passion is a valid reason to do or stop doing something  but it needs to be based in some evidence that your alternative path through life will sustain you and make you happy.,btohqsg
it’s a product of the society we live in to think that way,btohqsg
For me I was not a great student but I like the money just a bit more than I hate stress,btohqsg
Yea money is a valid reason too,btohqsg
My issue is more of giving up a passion when things get more technical or less “fun” because they never did their due diligence in seeing what that field is actually about,btohqsg
No la  you just have to be satisfied with less  it’s not “bye bye”. You still live in a safe and very well ordered society.,btohqsg
You can’t afford to stay in a swanky condo  but that doesn’t mean the end of the world  the hedonic treadmill you run needs to be sustained by your ability to create value or emulate value creation.,btohqsg
cos you go straight into your course,btohqsg
that’s if you alr know what you want by that point which not everyone does,btohqsg
Then be the best in this field. Go to the best university,btohqsg
And not learn things irrelevant such as history for computing etc etc,btohqsg
i mean i’m doing a PhD in it now,btohqsg
Degree just makes u earn the right to sit for interviews tbh,btohqsg
Whether u can do the work or make your salary worth it is another different thing,btohqsg
also it looks good on paper,btohqsg
it’s also proof that you can actually learn and pick up technical information at a higher level,btohqsg
i think that’s like the real value of a degree,btohqsg
Fair  but it’s uncommon for someone who has a legitimate degree to be unable to function at a minimally acceptable level at work,btohqsg
