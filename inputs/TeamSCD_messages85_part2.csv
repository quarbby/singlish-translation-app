If u jam brake  car ABS kick in  means ur tyres either not grippy or brakes alr too powerful. Need BBK for what.If you jam brake  car doesn't want to stop  that one then need BBK.,btohqsg
But i like cos it's between w30 and w40,btohqsg
Shud save engine without compromise for performance,btohqsg
My understanding is turbo cars shouldnt run too thin right,btohqsg
We NA cars can run w30 also,btohqsg
I tried from 40 to 30  more power... 40 dam draggy,btohqsg
i added XADO metal conditioner in my recent service.,btohqsg
should help w lubrication & friction reduction,btohqsg
Well  what you dont want is when you need the brakes that time end up the brakes overkill and lock up,btohqsg
From got brakes become no brakes,btohqsg
how much to put SSBH? i tink that 1 is vfm move haha.,btohqsg
all the best man. stupid rule,btohqsg
light car move ez  stop also ez haha no use for bbk unless show,btohqsg
I paint red for show 😂,btohqsg
220 for the lines100 for installation60 for brake fluid.Bleeding and everything else alr included,btohqsg
But it varies from car to car,btohqsg
Cos diff car got different length,btohqsg
I rmb my old swift sport had like 6 lines. 2 in front  4 in the rear. So garage R also shocked.,btohqsg
4 lines for the rear? lol so weird,btohqsg
they told me 2 is the foot brake. Then the handbrake 2 more. Or something like that,btohqsg
sounds similar to my 33. it's because the rear brake line had a solid piping in the middle. so flexible > solid > flexible.,btohqsg
