Hi All. Need help on this. I deposit $2 inside webull. After i sold my fractional shares and withdraw out  but i did maintain the $2 inside. Am i eigible for the additional 2 claims after 30 days?,btohqsg
Hi all  may I check if there is any way to earn rewards/miles/cash back on IPP please?,btohqsg
I believe withdrawing out any funds voids you from the 2 shares,btohqsg
So if I dine in restaurant at a hotel and use DBS altitude card  I get 3 mpd instead of the standard 1.2 mpd?,btohqsg
personally i use syfe because of simple user interface,btohqsg
what do u invest in syfe?,btohqsg
It says Online flight & hotel transactions  not sure if the hotel transactions need to be online as well? If needs to be online as well then you just get 1.2,btohqsg
currently is qqqm and some local sg company,btohqsg
As long as >0 should be eligible  that's what I read,btohqsg
hey all experts  I've got a question:I want to get the 3mpd from UOB Krisflyer card + 3mpd from kris+ promo at Harvey Norman that ends this month.To get the 3mpd from the card  I need to clock it under online spending? Is linking it to Google pay enough? Or do I need to pay with amaze to clock it as online spending.Thanks!,btohqsg
yes so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
main benefit is another $1k limit for 4mpd if u keeping citi rewards visa while u apply for crmc,btohqsg
once u activate the mastercard the visa cannot be used already right?,btohqsg
no ah  can get both cards with separate limit. need to redeem points separately also,btohqsg
I don't use miles.. maybe will cancel the card instead... unless there's a way to convert miles to cash?,btohqsg
CRMC can convert points to cashback,btohqsg
can redeem ticket for nominees and get paid for it  check out carousell,btohqsg
Hi  will offsetting my purchases on DBS TM be worth it? Or should I accumulate for miles instead?,btohqsg
May I check if profits from trading will need to be declared with IRAS as a Singapore citizen as well?,btohqsg
No. Singapore has no capital gains tax,btohqsg
Trading gains may be subjected to income taxes,btohqsg
What mean with pay online? When I can QR code for paynow  it only show Paylah,btohqsg
If only show Paylah   means can't use,btohqsg
Yes just sounds like iras will tax it if profit big enough. No worries,btohqsg
but by doing so  you have the card info saved in the gpay account. When you buy something online using your windows desktop (signed in with the same google account that your gpay is linked to)  at the payment page it should auto prompt the card to use for payment. when you select on the card (eg your dbs altitude)  they will ask for the CVV. after you key in your card info will be populated without you having to dig out the physical card.,btohqsg
I posted this in the morning i copy and paste here again,btohqsg

Hi  for buying travel insurance  no credit card would award cashback or miles i assume?,btohqsg
So the best is like getting thru shopback or singsaver?,btohqsg
But the transaction is per $5 block  so if you buy less than $5 then no points given,btohqsg
yeahhh just wanted to know if its eligible because DBS blocks off many payment apps like favepay etcetc hahaha,btohqsg
so just wanted to check with the people here  if they have tried and tested before :),btohqsg
not true  9x points no $5 block,btohqsg
meaning to say $5 block is for 1x base points only?,btohqsg
its based on the whole month's total spendings and not by per transaction to allocate the points?meaning to say as long as month's total ends with a $5 (though not always likely)  then can maximise points allocation?,btohqsg
9X:Divide transaction by 5 and multiply by 9.0  round to 2 decimal places.,btohqsg
