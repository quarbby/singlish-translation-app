Yes! Like after surgery.. those fractured arm or leg de.. need do physio too,btohqsg
The more flexible you are the easier to prevent injuries !,btohqsg
Cos 1st 3 mths is critical. If no do well  u cant even twist ur leg/arm,btohqsg

have to really push yourself to do it I guess,btohqsg
That time i fractured arm    twice a wk go physio zz,btohqsg
For my leg   physio ask me sit on the chair.. get up without using arm to push myself up.. use leg strength,btohqsg
Arm de i cant remIs like 20 yrs back ü§£,btohqsg
trying to strengthen the leg muscles I guess,btohqsg

Aiya  I think I hurt my leg again  which physio you go huh ?,btohqsg
Is it must feel ur leg  u recover faster? ü§£,btohqsg
oh but is it still in the Polyclinic ? Mine is just different floor,btohqsg
feel ur leg  as in they touch your leg  or you mean you feel your leg,btohqsg
I thought it‚Äôs a serious question,btohqsg
When polyclinic after xray cant find out whats wrongThey will refer u to hospital,btohqsg

actually the second doc I saw ask me if I want physio or specialist cause she also dunno what‚Äôs wrong ‚Ä¶..,btohqsg
Then I tell her you tell me which I should go la lol you doc not me what,btohqsg
I think she sent me to physio instead cause she paiseh dunno what to write to the specialist to refer also,btohqsg
Depends what ur issue. Last time i got tennis elbow  they refer me to ttsh sports injury dept,btohqsg
I think that‚Äôs the problem  the doctor dunno how to see so she also of course dunno where to refer lo lol,btohqsg
I think mine probably should go hospital for scans and such ba,btohqsg
Cause if not it‚Äôs hard for them also,btohqsg
Unless they specialize in these injuries,btohqsg
Aiyo.. actually a few polyclinic doctors they dunno de.. my experience,btohqsg
I mean some doctors probably new ba so they still learning as well I guess,btohqsg
U should.. maybe u go A&E.Since polyclinic dunno where to refer u,btohqsg
Ur issue also quite long le,btohqsg
But ok la since it is slowly slowly recovering so I dun bother for now le I guess,btohqsg
At least mine now they direct me to proper dept,btohqsg
