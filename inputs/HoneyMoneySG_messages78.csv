thank you guys for the anwsers!,btohqsg
Hi  can I check  if I have 50k in my uob bank 1. is it worth it to use $600 on uob krisflyer? 1.2 miles per dollar = 720 miles.2. Or should I get uob evol  spend $600  get $161 interest monthly and $40 cashback from evol card?Is $200 better or 720 miles better?,btohqsg
So lame‚Ä¶ some people talk as if they invest like warrant buffet returns just when they googled some info on the internet.,btohqsg
guys  any lobang to buy engagement rings.,btohqsg
Buy lab grown diamonds if you really must,btohqsg
Is Syfe Reits still worth considering?,btohqsg
This is a strange question  but to answer the question  usually people will take the $200.Unless you value a mile more then 27.78 cents (wow)  then the cash would be more worth it,btohqsg
a fair bit  carat for carat. If the jewellers i went to had the design i wanted + lab grown would have gone for that instead.,btohqsg
Yes a lot of cheaper for the same thing just no GIA cert.  but if you can buy gold or a Rolex as a gift even better than some diamond ring,btohqsg
If you're interested in miles  you may wish to consider other cards like UOB Lady (6mpd for selected categories) which count towards spending for One account.Typically  there is no need for general spending cards,btohqsg
but $500 in specialized spending in Lady might be a bit too much for some ppl,btohqsg
Ya  have to see your spending lor. But I believe Ladys is the only miles card that works with One account  since TS floated the idea of miles,btohqsg
Hi all  quick check if the additional 1% interest is only for the first 20k balance in CPF OA? Any amount in excess of 20k will only earn 2.5%?,btohqsg
You can also check out moissanite if your partner is okay with diamond alternatives. The hardness is not as high as diamond but still above 9.0 so no need to worry that much about wear and tear as compared to something like cubic zirconia.,btohqsg

I am DCA-ing now. It seems to have a really good valuation now and if holding for the long term should be good.,btohqsg
May I know what‚Äôs DCA means? I m thinking to open syfe acc also.. I saw advertised 3.8% guarantee,btohqsg
Dollar Cost Average (DCA) - You buy the same dollar amount (e.g. $500) every month. This means that when its high  you buy fewer shares and when its low  you buy more shares. Over the long term  it should give you a lower average cost.Maybe Chris has a video on this haha,btohqsg
Hi Guys  would like to ask about UOB Stash account. If u put $100k from now till say 25 Dec  do I get the max blended interest of around 3% for the pro-rated period?,btohqsg
Oh understood. U got put the 3.8%? I think the name is syfe cash. I wonder if really capital guaranteed,btohqsg
3.8% i think is syfe insure? got 3 months lockup iirc,btohqsg
May I know where to check the dividend amount I received at Moomoo?,btohqsg
Also covered on Syfe Cash+ Guaranteed 3.8% p.a. here (3-12 months lock in)https://youtu.be/ubuvxYTtsxQ?si=ok9jxu-3Yd8p_7Vo,btohqsg
Syfe beat the iEdge S-REIT Leaders index which it is tracking by a little bit but that's before mgt fee.CSOP iEdge S-REIT Leaders Index ETF or SYFE REIT+  which will you choose?,btohqsg

My Triple Credit Card Strategy for 2024https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0dtcQXhDXs,btohqsg
Nobody can answer this question for you unless you provide more details.What is your MAB in Nov?If your Nov MAB is higher than Dec MAB  you get nothing for Dec.,btohqsg
Hi can someone give me the link comparison of uob evol vs uob one card? My main priority is to get the interest on my savings.,btohqsg
been uaing uob one card ever. shd i chg to uob evol? always use this card for groceries  online spending  dinner etc.,btohqsg
if you aiming consistently $500 per month and you also spend at bonus merchants.. UOB One $500 tier could be better than UOB Evol,btohqsg
btw just to share u can apply for credit card in malaysia...cimb,btohqsg
Oh? What‚Äôs the process? Go to any CIMB branch in JB and tell them  assuming with just passport?,btohqsg
online spending is under shopee?groceries under DFI?current expenses per month ?,btohqsg
Can I check regarding to UOB 7.8%If I used evol card with the limit spend of $600 or exceed $1k or $2k. Can I get the evol card cash back  interest depending on the amount in the bank and quarterly cash back of $50/100/200?,btohqsg
are u confused with uob evol and uob one?,btohqsg
uob one has tiered spending of 500/1000/2000uob EVOL is minimum 600$ and NO tiered spending,btohqsg
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.1) UOB one account refers to 7.8% which tiered to the spending 500/1k/2k2) UOB one credit card with rebate.3) evol credit card is minimum $600 and no tiered spending.,btohqsg
If I used UOB one account together with evol credit. Am I getting evol cash back  7.8% and tiered to the spending cash back.,btohqsg
UOB one account interest is unlocked via spending $500 on eligible cards + salary transferno tier based on spending  only on account balance,btohqsg
1) No tiered spending for UOB one account. just spend min $500 with appropriate cards (UOB One cc  evol  lady etc). Salary crediting of 1.6k too.,btohqsg
not too sure about the 7.8% i/r though‚Ä¶. maybe gurus can help explain paiseh üòÖ,btohqsg
the 500/1k/2k spend mechanism you mentioned in 1) is the tiered cashback mechanism for the uob onecredit card,btohqsg
7.8% is between 75k and 100k. EIR on 100k is 5%,btohqsg
yeah  clicking on the i will tell you which cards you can use to clock this $500 eligible spending. Off the top of my head  can use UOB One card  Evol and Lady,btohqsg
Only put credit card. So I just want to clarify. Is it evol card can get evol card cashback  7.8% & quarterly rebate.,btohqsg
If you use the evol card to clock the card spend:Yes evol cashback.Yes 7.8% (between 75k and 100k)No quarterly rebate (that is for UOB One credit card),btohqsg
Hi  can I reconfirm again  if I want to do VCMA.. should I do it this year 31 Dec or 01 Jan 2024?,btohqsg
My MAB in Nov is only 1k. I intend of putting total 100k in for about 20 days  not sure if I‚Äôll get the pro-rated interest,btohqsg
Before 31 Dec to clock tax relief for this year's assessment (which will be released next year).On 1 Jan to clock tax relief for 2024 tax assessment  as well as to top-up towards the increased BHS amount.,btohqsg
not hitting maximum days..can say considered prorated..your MAB on the final tier cannot hit max..happened to my November,btohqsg
Then you can visit UOB Stash website and enter your Dec MAB on the calculator  the website will tell you how much Dec interest you will get. I think it is less than 1.5% of interest compare to 3% if you placed it for 1 full month.,btohqsg
My credit strategy is use Uob ladies solitaire for food and supermarket. The rest with Citi rewards plus amaze. Cancelling other cards for NTB status for new sign ups.,btohqsg
1. shopee and lazada2. no DFI. Sheng siong  NTUC. nO DFI shop nearby.3. 900-1k,btohqsg
Buy from overseas if buying diamonds. Much cheaper. Can just ship to sg,btohqsg
hi all  im very new to this so pls excuse me if my question is very dumbim currently looking to apply the UOB ladies solitare i might be abit late bc the 6 miles per dollar only for another two months do you all think i should even bother with applying for this?I currently just applied for the UOB krisflyer bc of the sign up bonus  but i dont plan to use it as my main mile earning strategy  im quite lost on what i should do next :(Should i just go with the citi rewards+amaze combo?(my lifestyle is mostly spending overseas and on travel  im barely in sg)thank u in advance!!,btohqsg
Uob lady at 4mpd still very competitive.,btohqsg
after feb itll be back to 4mpd is it? i mightve been confused by the description,btohqsg
Nothing confirmed yet. We all crossing fingers. Sigh,btohqsg
got people sell voucher on shopee also de,btohqsg
"also i talked to the UOB credit card advisor person and she just say ""ohh what where u hear one  no ah  itll stay 6mpd forever"" : ) i didnt know they can just spread misinfo sia",btohqsg
let just assume that if they dont extend the 6 mpd the old earn rate is 4mpd for bonus which is a decent card also,btohqsg
Just apply lo  since alr got kf uob. All under uob  can get all the cards then wait and see if they extend the 6mpd,btohqsg
and she also say theres no such thing as overseas spending surcharge (like the extra 3.5%)so after talking to her and doing all my research i came back even more confused,btohqsg
shopee is 8.33% lazada 3.33%shengshiong ntuc   3.33%you take your previous statment and calculate if more than 40$ cashback based on the spending then if more than 40$ get the UOB one,btohqsg
u can consider buy ntuc and sheng siong voucher from seller on shopee instead,btohqsg
i have been using uob lady before the promo 6mpd  4mpd is good and uob pool all rewards earn under different card together which is a super big plus point for me.,btohqsg
oh damn! okok thank u so much,btohqsg
At the rate men are using likely will be nerfed but let‚Äôs see how lo,btohqsg
promo stated till 29 feb 2024 so have to wait till then to see if it will be extended,btohqsg
Yeah enjoy till the last promo day,btohqsg
i have a few big purchases coming up  i guess ill apply and save to use it when the card arrive before feb bah,btohqsg
Which brokerage is good for trading penny stocks? Recently noticed that Syfe started adding some hidden fee ($0.003 per stock) for stocks below $2 charge,btohqsg
Riding on this question  I created a stash account le but currently is $0 in Nov n Dec... I parked all the funds currently in GXS to recieve 2.68%Intend is to only trf in 1 lot $100k when I accumulated to full 100k to stash on 1st day of tt fateful month  is this thinking sound?,btohqsg
Stash account calculates interest base on tier n MAB. GXS calculates interest based on end day balance.You need to calculate when is the best time to switch.Anyway  GXS max amount is $75k  beyond that you need to find a new ‚Äúhome‚Äù üè¶ for your savings.,btohqsg
Confirm no. Only if your MAB is 100K then you will get 3%  since you put 100K now but transfer out after 25 Dec  your MAB will not be 100K then you can look at their tier interest. But confirm not a pro-rated 3%.,btohqsg
For Stash account  1st month seems to be special. Eg. If open account on for example  5th of the month  and immediately 100K in  I think the MAB for that month will be 100K and not pro-rated. Happened to me when I opened my Stash account in July. I thought need to average out so I calculate nicely and dump 110K in  then MAB for July becomes 110K instead of 100K..,btohqsg
HI guys which CC still recognise insurance premium as eligible transactions? Does UOB One Account count tat as part of the $500 spend?,btohqsg

Is it you can get $1250 monthly interest with trust bank if u deposit $500k with the new 3% interest rate?,btohqsg
Travel spent have to plan ahead using the Uob solitaire choosing food and hotels category. With the 3k limit can preload supermarket gift card then next quarter moved to other categories,btohqsg
Is it true the webull new account sign up promotion is any amount? I put S$10 also able to receive 10 stock ranging from $8?,btohqsg

For cashback  I'm thinking of testing a strategy of Maybank Platinum Visa + ipaymy/CardUp.Note: This is all just theory crafting  nothing is tested yet. Also thanks to Mb for rejecting my application previously  so I couldn't test this.With the latest changes to Mb Platinum Visa  insurance premiums can only make up of up to 50% of the eligible spending of the each tier.Using 2k tier for example:First 50% (1k): Charge the card directly.- Premium paid: 1kSecond 50% (1k): Charge via ipaymy  with promo fee rate at 1.79%.- Factoring fees to hit 1k  premium paid: 983- Lazy method  ignoring fees  premium paid: 1000Total premium paid per month: 1983 / 2000Fees paid per month: 17 / 17.9Total eligible spending: 2000 / 2017.9,btohqsg

dependent on many other factors  but above 80k chargeable income is where i feel the pinch.of course you have to balance things like cashflow since srs cant be withdrawn till 63  having limited options in what you can invest in srs etc,btohqsg

Good morning all.. just to confirm overseas usage on dining n shopping  use Amaze to pair with UOB privi card can get 1.4mpd? This is my best option as I don‚Äôt hold ladies card n others,btohqsg
Yes if the mcc is not excluded,btohqsg
Seems like ladies solitaire is the best paired w amaze now  but I can‚Äôt get it now üòÖ,btohqsg
Maybe u can evaluate if it is worth paying 2% to get 1.4mpd. Usually if it is an isolated travel case personally I can use YouTrip. Because need to consider orphan miles if you don‚Äôt have mile strategy.,btohqsg
U mean using amaze with UOB privi I still will get charged 2% to earn 1.4m?,btohqsg
I dun have exact data but recently 2% is from amaze,btohqsg
It is more ‚Äúworth it‚Äù if pair with 4mp citi rewards.,btohqsg
U can get uob lady or citireward,btohqsg
For mcc i am sure i go for maybank fnf for my bonus cat,btohqsg
Thank you let me check  if 2% then def not worth. My threshold for ‚Äúpaying for miles‚Äù is max 2cents per mile üòÇ,btohqsg
I be more concerned on orphan miles. But looks like you are new to bank for others . Sign up for free gifts pls haha,btohqsg
Thank you both.. but I‚Äôm self-employed now and I need time for NOA to reflect income so atm I can‚Äôt apply for cc üòÜ,btohqsg
If don't mind not having NTB bonus... Can get secured cc instead,btohqsg
Get Lady with dining category. Even if 4mpd is better than 1.4mpd after promo end. The Lady miles earned will pool together with PRVI.,btohqsg
Thanks! Good idea! For the UOB lady‚Äôs or lady‚Äôs solitaire?,btohqsg
The prob w lady‚Äôs is only 1k cap. I‚Äôm prolly spending few k on dining in jap üòÖ,btohqsg
Get PPV n vs. they are all pooled.,btohqsg
Sorry what‚Äôs PPV n vs? And what u mean pooled? I‚Äôm still quite noob in all these üôè,btohqsg
Pretty sure they wrote the requirements in the website.,btohqsg
Uob lady 10k secured  solitaire 30k secured,btohqsg
Uob prefer platinum visa (mobile contactless 4mpd)  uob visa signature (foreign spending/contactless 4mpd),btohqsg
Pool mean all reward for uob are all combine into 1 acct unlike some bank is 1 card 1 acct,btohqsg
Thank you  you all are awesome üôè. UOB plat visa contactless my no.1 card. 9x first 1k I will max out every mth. Ok I‚Äôll check out vs and solitaire :),btohqsg
If I have uob ladys solitaire for dining and travel  and I plan to cancel my uob one card (which I have been using for shoppee and grab+utilities)+ I have hsbc revolution  citi rewards and dbs womens worldWhat should I replace the uob one with? Uob ppv or uob visa signature? Hahaha,btohqsg
Look like you not cashback team  all miles card. Can consider uob ppv,btohqsg
I used to be cashback team but now I'm travelling more xD,btohqsg
Uob ppv 4mpd up to 1.1k spend per month for online and mobile contactless  no minimum spending. Better then vs which required 1k on contactless to get 4mpd,btohqsg
Oh I'm thinking of vs for the fcy though,btohqsg
Because if I travel  uob ladys is only up to 3k  and maybe citirewards paired with amaze for 1k overseas spend. My trips tend to be 1 mth so I was thinking of visa signature for fcy spending,btohqsg
Ppv is good for contactless but visa signature has that. And shoppee/grab I can replace with dbs womens world card for 4mpd,btohqsg
Just the utilit bills part cannot replace,btohqsg
If u can hit then just get both,btohqsg
Uob pool so it is ok,btohqsg
I only travel 2-3 times a year but loong trips and I spend a lot on them. So wondering if visa signature is more suitable,btohqsg
Don't really spend locally much. But cannot waive if I don't really use right,btohqsg
I have no problem waiving with uob when i have almost all their card  some i rarely spend also haha,btohqsg
Haha OK so both cards got no min spend for annual fee waiver ah. Then I will just get both,btohqsg
Uob ppv good for normal day cover if u run out since no minimun spend for online and mobile contactless,btohqsg
Average daily balance  not end of the month,btohqsg

is there like a category of spending? lets say it is below 1k a month,btohqsg
like if spend low or high what should i be looking at?,btohqsg
Should be gone. Card rewards is with the bank. FFP points (like Krisflyer) is with Krisflyer. Do cash out your points first before u cancel the card (especially sinec this isn't a co-brand card),btohqsg
There are 2 promos:1. public offer compares Average Monthly Balance2. exclusive offer is Entire Balance  but Last Day of a certain Month Balance must be $XXk more than a Specified Last Day of a certain Month BalanceMust always read your TNC properly depending on which promo you are on.,btohqsg
basically my spending is not much monthly  it wil about less than 1k,btohqsg
roughly how much savings u have?,btohqsg
Hi friends  anyone has any experience with the moneysmart promo? if its for citi rewards  i paid for a private hospital  bill using amaze  it counted as my 4mpd on the card  will it also count towards my $500 eligible spend for the gift reward?,btohqsg
So what will be another alternative card? As I thinking to purchase 3x air ticket with SQ to jpn next yr. But check out Citi rewards don't think it cover travels.,btohqsg
Furthermore  I think UOB lady card only providing 6mpd for the first 1k only,btohqsg
if can upgrade to uob solitaire 6mpd for $3k,btohqsg
should be eligible based on TnC,btohqsg
Worst case UOB KF? 3mpd uncapped on SIA group,btohqsg
Alternatively u can do ur UOB Prvi miles  hit requirement  transfer out to your KF account  then u cancel card (u do the math),btohqsg

Kris + is an app to tag on to credit cards?For now  it‚Äôs more of payment for the venue like the deposit and various instalments. From what I asked  seems most venues allow instalment and credit card payment unless it‚Äôs for the deposit,btohqsg
In that case  think your best case is to refer to Chris video hahahah (do see amount and work out the math tho),btohqsg

What advice u need?Look out for ways to make ur purchases online  for me contactless is easy.The difficult part is online purchasesSo need to look for ways to make it online  using fairprice app  XNAP etc etc,btohqsg
simplygo yup but have to fulfill min. 800 on SIA groups (SIA SCOOT flights or Krisshop) within the same membership year,btohqsg
Thank you. If not  it will be 1.2 miles right?,btohqsg
but the miles will be delayed though (i.e.  13-14 months).,btohqsg
you will be getting 1.2miles first. and then 13-14 months later  you will get the remaining 1.8miles.,btohqsg
can I check  if I spend $250 on contactless already  any other amount spent on contactless will automatically go under other spend which gives 0.3% cash back?,btohqsg
Yes if I am not wrongU still need min 600 spent,btohqsg
no  beyond $250 mobile contactless no cashback  still clock to $600 min spend though,btohqsg
I'm going to take it as you meant mobile contactless.. but no  they don't earn the 0.3%.,btohqsg
Okay maybe my answer is wrong then,btohqsg
But there's possibility that normal contactless can get  but I'd rather look elsewhere for a better cashback rate.,btohqsg
ok so what falls under other spending(0.3% category)?,btohqsg
anything other than the usual tncs (utilities  paying fines  educations etc),btohqsg
using physical card or use at uob$ merchant,btohqsg
for KrisFlyer UOB Credit Card  what happens if I don't link it to my krisflyer member number?Does it store the miles on UOB first as UNI$/milesuntil I link?,btohqsg
If hit $250  change your payment method to Xnap at hawker  Shopback pay  KFC App  Favepay  Grab App  Gojek App  MCD App  Fairprice App etc‚Ä¶. They are counted as online. Or buy wogi voucher.,btohqsg
can i confirm with UOB Evol...i dont need to shop at DIG merchants...i shop anywhere as long i met min spending $600 with nfc payment  ill get bonus interest and cashback,btohqsg
don't you need to provide a KF member number during application?,btohqsg
there's an option to put 'no'just a hypothetical question  wondering if can use that option to 'extend' the earned miles if needed,btohqsg
must be mobile contactless (tap phone) and met min $600 spend (not excluded spending) to get bonus cashback,btohqsg
What is DIG? There are exclusion clauses in Evol TnC. What do you mean nfc?,btohqsg
you'll be forced to have one üòÇ,btohqsg
Yeap will check out his vid thanks!,btohqsg
I suggest to spend on other cards after maxing.. possibly those no minimum spend ones  getting 1.5% also better than 0.3%.,btohqsg

"Just verified with UOB CSO  where my understanding of my t&c was correct. Only when issued UOB$ then no cashback from the merchant  if not issued with UOB$ then cashback will be given to the card.

Hi all. Need some advice on UOB Xmas Savings promotion. Read Ts and Cs but still not sure.a. I emptied my account on 30 Sep; I submitted the Form on 1 Oct; and deposited $100K on 1 Oct.b. My earmark didnt happen because my balance dropped below $100k for a few days from 25-30 Oct. (i must be blur to think that I only need the $100k earmark amount by 31 Oct).c. In this case  my reference 30 Sep amount is still $0. Can I still submit the Form now in Dec  and earmark by 31 Jan and end the earmark by 15 April 2024? If so  do I need to withdraw to another bank account  and deposit the $100k again?Thanks for advice.,btohqsg

The YouTrip Googlepay promo got any minimum spending? Can I spend 0.10 cent x 10 times?,btohqsg
ensure most of december 2023 and ENTIRE January 2024 you have $100k incremental + 30th Sep balance amount... then the earmark will happen in January 2024.what is your account situation in November and December? Was the $100k inside all along?From what I have observed  UOB requires you to have the $100k FOR MOST OF THE ENTIRE PRIOR MONTH + ENTIRE EARMARK MONTH then the earmark will happen in the earmark monthFor example you must have $100k in early October 2023 + entire November 2023 then the earmark will happen in November 2023.,btohqsg
If I apply 100k NC bid  I will only be alloted approx 95k at 3.74%. Note that approx 95%,btohqsg

yeah i think no harm to submit the form again NOW..but if you submit the form NOW  i would suggest you also transfer in the $100k fresh funds NOW  and do not touch it at all from NOW till the earmark happens around 20th January 2024.,btohqsg

need some explanation here  how much is 1 KF mile? if 1 dollar 4 KF miles so 1 KF mile isn't 0.25¬†cent?,btohqsg
You earn 4 miles per $1 spent  the miles can be redeemed for primarily flights with SIA. For example a one-way flight to Japan business class is 52 000 miles  which means you have spent $13 000 on a 4mpd card to accumulate this 52 000 miles.,btohqsg
Let's say the flight is worth $1040 to purchase using cash. That makes the miles earned have a value of 104000/52000 = 2 cents per mile.,btohqsg

If I use an amaze card to tap on a physical  will I get 10x points for Citi rewards card?,btohqsg

Speaking of CPF  is there any platforms or something able to use our CPF OA to invest in higher interest rate financial products?,btohqsg
beware of certain merchants having MCCs that will incur extra 1% charge - common ones you might mistakenly paywave at are miniso,btohqsg
Also can consider looking at TBills  though for this you‚Äôll have to sign up via banks,btohqsg

Does it make sense to use Instarem with CRMC overseas assuming that there‚Äôs SCB Journey card for this month?,btohqsg
Just went to Endowus website to check about investing with CPF OA,btohqsg
Thanks for the info  so those restaurant eg: Din Tai Fung is going to be rewarded 10xpoints as well. Just confuse does it convert to online food or just all change to online shopping whatever physical transaction I made,btohqsg
that'll depend on your valuation of a mile  since using amaze+CRMC means you're paying about 2% more over base MC/Visa rates for 2 more mpd,btohqsg
Then don‚Äôt think can invest anywhere . CPF regulation,btohqsg
"it doesn't change the MCC  only the transaction method becomes ""online""",btohqsg
Online conversion only. MCC code remains,btohqsg
so if your transaction has an MCC that isn't excluded for CRMC 10x points  you'll always get the 10x points if transacting through Amaze,btohqsg
Yeah but was wondering about the spread by scb. Not sure if anyone has an idea tho (Chris I think calculated before Trust to be 0.5%  so pretty sure SCB won‚Äôt just follow spot),btohqsg
taking the rebate into account  you'll end up with 0% bank fee = very similar to trust rates (Visa base rates),btohqsg
i suppose you might end up with a tiny bit more than 2mpd  even? since 2mpd is on the whole txn+bank fee,btohqsg
but most importantly with the rebate you aren't paying extra for miles  which some folks try to avoid. so if that's your thing it's something to consider,btohqsg

possible  but would be better if you hold both CRV and CRMC instead for 1k cap eachunfortunately the points don't pool in this case,btohqsg
Reapply for Mastercard  they won‚Äôt do points transfer,btohqsg
Good idea. How does the transfer of miles works then? I have to pay 2 times for the transfer?,btohqsg
unfortunately yes if you're accruing on both cards since no pooling,btohqsg
hi all  was wondering what do you all recommend for paying 3k+ insurance- min $4k spend promotion with uob VI  pay the $645 annual fee and get 40k miles (cardup)or- min $8k spend 1.8mpd with citi payall using existing crmc?,btohqsg
"Okay sure! So essentially I just take it that I have 2 cards from ""2 banks"". When I transfer the miles will just pay 2 times right? Haha",btohqsg
i guess you could say that. if this is your sole citi card note that none of their other cards pool points either,btohqsg

Can we pay back full housing loan in lumpsum using COF OA funds?,btohqsg
Can but what for? Because you would not only have to pay back the OA amount when you sell your property you will 1) have to pay the accured interest 2) CPF will not be paying you the 2.5% interest which they normally would have paid on the sum withdrawn. Effectively you are losing 5%! Just refi the loan unless its very small. Rates right now are as low as 3.0%,btohqsg

Have you tried it  It still works for me,btohqsg
I tried the paynow method still waiting to see if reflected,btohqsg
Not true.1. If you register in Oct and wish to earmark in Nov  just need to ensure 31 Oct balance is > 30 Sep balance + your earmark amount. And maintain in Nov till they earmark.If till now your fund hasn't been earmarked  just need to ensure on 31 Dec ur fund fulfill the requirement  no need to register again. And maintain it in Jan till they earmark.2. Your Sep 30 balance cannot be 0 if you had some fund in Sep. You need to include the base interest as well. Check the estatement from the bank. What is the end day balance on 30 Sep  aka. Your end of month balance in Sep.,btohqsg
does the paynow allow u to select purpose as salary payment? If not will not work,btohqsg

Hello  how can I send USD from DBS to OCBC account? Need to use overseas transfer with DBS Remit ? Thanks,btohqsg
Hi! I just watched Chris‚Äôs video on draining UOB One account by 31 Dec in anticipation of lunar new year savings promo. Since I have a lady‚Äôs savings account with UOB  can I transfer the amount there to hold and once signed up for savings promo  transfer back to One account? Or should I transfer out to another bank (DBS)?,btohqsg
Make sure you transfer out from all uob accounts,btohqsg
note that since 31dec is a Sunday  need to transfer out by 30 Dec  best if in the morning (in case cut off time is earlier due to new year),btohqsg
Can transfer back the 100k on Dec 31? I.e. Dec 30 = $0  Dec 31 = $100k. Or  better to keep both days 0?,btohqsg
Why u wanna do that? By right any transfers in/out on 31 Dec will taken to be done on 2 Jan  but better to keep $0 to avoid any complication.,btohqsg
mm... DBS  UOB seems to reflect the balance as of the transfer datetime immediately? Not like HSBC that have cutoff time/Sunday.,btohqsg
u got see the date of transaction if u transfer on Sunday?,btohqsg
That was what I did. I had a withdrawal on 25 Oct to drop below 100K  but by 31 Oct I brought balance up to >103K (I had 3K balance on 30 Sep). However  the bank agent called me and said because my balance dipped from 25 Oct  I am not eligible for the bonus hence my funds were not earmarked.,btohqsg
So far between UOB and DBS  fast transfer is always reflected immediately for me  regardless if I transfer at 11:58pm or on weekends/PH.,btohqsg
Isn't FAST transfer immediate? Only non-FAST banks will take 2-3 business days. Correct me if I'm wrong.I got this info from the banks website. UOB  DBS  OCBC  SCB  HSBC and Citi all said the same.Only when accruing interest then there's a cut off time.,btohqsg
Hence I am puzzled  when this savings promo only covered till 2023 Dec 30. And wonder if I should 0 my UOB on Dec 30 or Dec 31 this time.But agreed with what you said earlier  I will leave Dec 30 and 31 as 0 to play safe. Esp the current promotion campaign only covered till 2023 Dec 30.,btohqsg
@acidgermbased on Mt's experience  whole month of Oct has to be 103k also (based on your scenario).,btohqsg
u registered in Oct? brought back to $103k before 10pm on 31 Oct?,btohqsg
funds transferred immediately but the date is the next work day,btohqsg
Yes. Registered on 1 Oct. Brought back to (30 Sep balance + 100K) by 31 Oct  and is reflected accurately in my monthly statement. Uob's issue is for the period 25-30 Oct  when my balance dropped to 60K.,btohqsg
I might have understood wrongly haha. But my understanding is as long 31 Oct is 30 Sep+100k should be ok liao,btohqsg
so strange  I had $0 earlier in the month and transferred in only last day of the month and kept till they earmark next month and got the cashback.,btohqsg
What can I say? Bank staff gave wrong info? I have earned $550 x 5 this year (2 names). I tried different patterns and also appealed successful because a GIRO deduction happened one day before the month end and caused my balance has $5 less than the desired amount  although immediately top it up on 1st day next month.Anyway what is your end of month balance for Sep and Oct on the bank estatement? And what time did you transfer on 31 Oct. I usually did the top up one day before month end  as we don't know when the bank will run the script on the last day of the month to check your balance (by right it should be at later part of the day). If at the point of checking  your available fund is less than the required amount  they won't earmark in Nov.,btohqsg
I did a FAST transfer out on 2 Dec at 9pm  on UOB TMRW also show 2 Dec. Seems quite immediate leh üòÖ,btohqsg
2 Dec is saturday  so ok ah,btohqsg
9pm leh.. haha only Sunday affected?,btohqsg
Okie I test this Sunday üò¨ hahaha,btohqsg
UOB fast transfer timing for Monday to Sat is 10:30pm. Sunday and PH will be next biz day.,btohqsg
Meaning I can try tonight already at 11pm should reflect tomorrow,btohqsg
This is for my friend. He does not wish to pay back to OA as reaching 55 in next few years and not selling house as well. He already reached FRS limit. After 55  surplus fund in OA above FRS can be withdrawn once RA is set. CPF interest is 2.5% but his home loan is about 3%-4%.,btohqsg
Just to be clear. The balance will reflect immediately  but the date will be tml's date.,btohqsg
The bank officer said I failed this (iii) clause - cuz I transferred money out on 25 Oct (to another bank) and deposited to UOB again by 31 Oct.I read the Ts and Cs but couldnt find which clause would support my argument that my 31 Oct balance is 100K more than my 30 Sep balance  and would be eligible for the bonus.,btohqsg
What if the customer only sees the promo on 30 Oct  then even if he/she deposit immediately  the fund won't get earmarked? It doesn't make sense.The pic above indicates 'whichever is later'  so my top up can fall in any day of 1 Oct till 31 Oct.,btohqsg
I think the question is what time did you top up on 31 Oct? If it is too late maybe the bank has already ran the script to check balance and your account failed the checking. So I usually top the fund one day before month end if I still need the fund elsewhere for that month. So far no issue for earmarking.,btohqsg
Check your September statement(in PDF copy). There should have an ‚Äúinterest credit‚Äùtransaction on 30 Sep after you cleared your account to $3k. Hence  your end day balance on 30 Sep is few dollars$Xhigher than $3k.Your account balance as of 31 Oct shall be $103k +$Xto trigger the earmark.If you want to play just in time transaction  do it before 6pm of that day. Nobody can guarantee your transaction after 6pm will be counted.,btohqsg
Thanks all for advice. If I put aside whether to appeal  can I still submit a new Participation Form in end-Dec  make sure I have $100K + 30 Sep balance  funds earmarked by 31 Jan 2024 and end earmark by 15 April 2024?,btohqsg
To avoid all these drama and guessing and appealingI would suggest the moment u register u immediately move in the $100k earmark money and don‚Äôt touch it anymoreAfter all it is earning the 5%pa uob one interest.,btohqsg
The tricky ones are if there are holidays and weekends involved.,btohqsg
Question is how do you get your 30 Sep balance? If you get it correctly  should be ok. If not  you will miss it again.,btohqsg
Based on the wording  as long as you have a net withdrawel on any day during the promotion period (wrt 30 SEP)  you lose your eligibility.,btohqsg
Would the best way be from the monthly statement from UOB?,btohqsg
Since the promo runs till 30 Dec  I suggest you top it up latest by 29 Dec to the desired amount. No need to register again. If if you want to do it  no harm also.,btohqsg
But based on the table you shared  wouldn't I already have missed the Oct and Nov Participation Form submission date  and need to submit once more in Dec?,btohqsg
Yes. Looks like you had failed to meet multiple criteria stated in the TnC. üòì1). Withdraw n redeposit.2). Did not maintain end day balance throughout3). Possibly did not meet the earmarked amount + 30 Sep balance. (Guessing only).*shake head*,btohqsg
Haha. Learn lesson. Luckily $550 is a good incentive but not life-damaging üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Whichever is later... you can register in Oct and fund in Dec also can  they will use Dec date then..,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  what is your end month balance for Sep and Oct and what time did you make the top up on 31 Oct?,btohqsg
think better to register in Dec bah,btohqsg
Since it is not life-damaging  my Suggestion to you is to empty all your UOB accounts by 30 December  6pm wait n praythere is UOB CNY promo that requires reference end day balance on 31 Dec.By doing this  you have another 3 months of chances to try your errors.If you participate Xmas Dec promo  n did not empty your account by 31 Dec  you can‚Äôt join the UOB CNY party if there is one.Take note - Past promotion is not a guarantee of future similar offers.,btohqsg
1. I realized I did make the stupid mistake.2.  I had a screenshot of bank balance on 30 Sep  showing $3448.3. However  official bank statement showed $3672.42 as of 30 Sep. (There was a Paynow transaction late in the day.)4. Official Bank statement is $103556.58 on 31 Oct.  (stupidly $120 lower than 30 Sep balance).,btohqsg
This is exactly what I guess you have some late crediting transactions. Hence  don‚Äôt play JIT. Give yourself $500 or $1000 buffer.,btohqsg
Just a clarification on this thread  to still qualify for the monthly one account bonus interest  I should transfer back the 100k and a little more to make up for the 2 day difference on 2 Jan? I,btohqsg
Time to change Paynow to another bank,btohqsg
Since I‚Äôm removing all of it on 30 Dec in hopes there‚Äôs a lunar new year savings promo.,btohqsg
But don‚Äôt want to jeopardise the one account bonus interest.,btohqsg
u can use Excel to determine the amount u need to maintain Monthly Average Balance of $100k to get the full 5% p.a. interest on $100k Monthly Average Balance.I calculated it is $107k for December (empty on 30th December early morning) and $103 400 for January (inject on 2nd January).YMMV,btohqsg
U will miss 2 day in dec so u need to put extra to cover that,btohqsg
Always use Excel. It is clearer and serves as a record.,btohqsg
Just being kiasi and kiasu as usual. I won't play with 30th Dec. It is the last working day of the year and typically Banks could have funky / unconventional cut off timing on 30th December which is a Saturday this year.I rather assume 29th December is the last working day,btohqsg
So effectively 28 days in Dec? 31 x 100K / 28 = $110715 from 1-29 Dec  and withdraw before 10.30pm on 29 Dec?,btohqsg
Is simply go excluded from maybank family and friends transport?,btohqsg
Hi all  I have 2 questions  hope someone can help out üôè Let's say there r 2 scenarios:1.If let's say Nov I spent $1000  and I already received my UOB account interest. This month (Dec) $400 from the previous month's purchase was refunded to me.Do I need to spend $500 or $900 for this month? Given that taken into account after the refund  $600 was still spent in Nov (> $500 condition met)2.Heng:If let's say Nov I spent $600  and I already received my UOB account interest. This month Dec $200 from the previous month's purchase was refunded to me.In this case is it I need to spend $700 for this month? Given that taken into account after the refund  $400 was effectively spent in Nov (< $500 spent),btohqsg
Isn't that interest is calculated on daily basis? So if you have 107k on one day  only the first 100k gets 5%  and the 7k will get only the base interest? Hence  the total interest for whole month will not be the same when there are some days with 0 balance?,btohqsg
It seems to be reflected as others category when I check on the treat SG maybank app,btohqsg
Monthly day average so if withdraw out on 30 dec u need to top up on other day to cover the shortfall for the dec 2 day,btohqsg

I will draw out on 30th Dec  Saturday 8am.,btohqsg
29 days if withdraw on 30 Dec,btohqsg
ok i think after the discussion above  i decided to be consistent with my kiasu and kiasi ness and make it $112k now... and then move out on 29th December morning instead  leaving just $10.,btohqsg
Do note that uob only allow 100k of transfer out per day normally. So need to put extra elsewhere,btohqsg
"""Elsewhere"" meaning in UOB but out of UOB ONE?",btohqsg
yes good tip. One way to bypass UOB $100k daily limit is to have joint accounts.So the other joint human opens up another $100k of transfer limit,btohqsg
I think I understand this better now.Even if I submitted Participation Form on 1 Oct  if I ensure my daily balance from 1 Nov to 31 Dec is above (100K + 30 Sep balance)  I still qualify for this promo and should expect earmark by 31 Dec?,btohqsg
if you had submitted on 1st Oct and put in $100k on 1st Oct and don't touch the money  your earmark would happen by 30th November.,btohqsg
The earmark always happens about 20 days AFTER the month you put the money (and don't touch at all),btohqsg
"I understand  but I did ""touch"" the money. The question is more forward-looking - am I still eligible for this promotion if from 1 Nov to 31 Dec  I maintain above $100k + 30 Sep balance?",btohqsg

And I should EMPTY the account for a day first? Cuz now it has $104K.,btohqsg
haha your account situation is a mess now  sorry to say.The problem is nobody knows what UOB has classified your account asMAYBE you should take Mousehunter advice and sit this one out.Empty your account on 29th December.. and hope for Chinese New Year promo (hopefully comparison date is 30th or 31st December) and do it 100% correctly,btohqsg

Say you register on 1 Oct If you want UOB to earmark in Nov  top up by early 31 Oct or better on 30 Oct and ensure the required amount is maintained in Nov until the fund is earmarked.If you want UOB to earmark in Dec  top up by early 30 Nov or better 29 Nov and ensure the required amount is maintained in Dec until the fund is earmarked.If you want UOB to earmark in Jan  top up by early 30 Dec or better 29 Dec and ensure the required amount is maintained in Jan until the fund is earmarked.Be sure to check estatement from bank on what is the actual end of month balance. For 30 Sept  you need to include the base interest (same as what is on the estatement)  for 31 Oct amount  you need to exclude the base interest for calculation.,btohqsg
Hi  sorry for the stupid qn coz first time participating. if i have 100k earmarked in the christmas promo already  then can i still empty my account on 29/30 Dec to zero my end of month balance in anticipation of the cny promo (if any)? Thank you!,btohqsg
Ah ok  so am I right to understand that I cannot qualify for the cny promo (if any) and will have to wait for the subsequent one after my earmark for the christmas promo has ended?,btohqsg
correct.Although 'in theory' you COULD register for a second earmark promo while the first earmark promo hasn't ended  it won't make sense  since the UOB One account only pays good interest up to $100k.If you had already earmarked $100k say for Christmas  and you hard force another $100k earmark for Chinese New Year  you would theoretically be having $200k in the UOB One account  with only $100k earning bonus interest and $100k earning base interest  albeit you do get 2 x earmark cash rewards. It is still not worth it.P.S. someone did mention there is a clause about you can only be involved in one promo at a time  but seriously  don't explore it la.. it doesn't make sense  since the 5% p.a. Bonus Interest is still the priority. The Earmark Cash Reward is just the Sweetener.,btohqsg

actually can apply another uob account for the new promo,btohqsg
thanks for the detailed explanation  much appreciates! Fully agree with you!,btohqsg
the next better one is STASH.. not worth doingbetter to find another human,btohqsg
hmm stash account? but dont have enough capital  need the 100k in uob one üòÖ,btohqsg
Yeah. End Sept still only 100K. It caused me unable to completely clear one of my account and had to keep extra 10K+ for 4 months... :(,btohqsg
just wondering why UOB never mentioned this change to customers..,btohqsg
Need to do the rotating game between 2 acct if got 200k,btohqsg
i have been bypassing the $100k daily limit using joint accounts,btohqsg
What do you mean rotating game? I just made 2 accounts both join the promo at the same time.,btohqsg
U can only have 1 acct one campaign isnt it,btohqsg
King Trazora did say you can open a second type of account to take part (i didn't try it myself),btohqsg
As in one national day u can use uob one  christmas use uob stash. But can do uob one 100k and uob stash 100k both under christmas?,btohqsg
yes but cannot use 2 accounts for the same promo,btohqsg
yes for the latter  definitely not,btohqsg
i think someone worked out Stash + earmark promo EIR.. and it was lousier than HSBC EGA i think,btohqsg
Stash plus earmark 100k is 4.7,btohqsg
yeah hsbc ega is about there  without the need for 3.5 months lock,btohqsg
But stash can be tricky  once interest or bonus in need to withdraw out same day or just dont touch for the whole earmark period,btohqsg
can also alternate between savings promos of uob and scb (bonus saver),btohqsg
Also can alternate UOB Savings promo and SCB Esaver and HSBC EGAactually plenty of options for now..,btohqsg
no this is not what I meant  no point go for esaver or hsbc ega since the interest is lower than 5% from uob one account for the same $100k.,btohqsg
scb bonus saver got 5%? need genuine salary credit ya?,btohqsg
https://www.sc.com/sg/saveuplevelup/?subChanCode=IB04&cid=sem-GOOGLE-58700008607321159-p78599344669-71700000116065347-na-sg-en&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA98WrBhAYEiwA2WvhOjsnPbNM6oZZ-O7ZWGSnR59tdTlSAyC6LxQ4C73dVYxnVcMXLZ2U5hoC-QUQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.dsbonus cashback from scb savings account on top of usual interest,btohqsg
I got 2 names. So 2 UOB One account. 1 name also opened stash account as well. So I attended all the promo happened this year and got $550 x 5.,btohqsg
do u have the workings? I did see $500 cashback for $100k (locked 3 months).but bonus saver without genuine salary seems tricky?,btohqsg
So meaning u done 2 promo registration under christmas for uob one and stash at the same time?,btohqsg
Attended the SCB promo too. Hopefully will be within first 1500.,btohqsg
yeah the first 1 500... i actually hate this kind of nonsense,btohqsg
Eh can you guys/gals educate me on Bonussaver even with the $500 cashback...doesn't seem that great (i don't get it).you need to have salary credit  and credit card spend (using lousy bonus saver credit card).?What's the EIR on $100k tier? remember credit card spend on Bonus Saver credit card doesn't earn miles/cashback?,btohqsg
No.. 2 physical persons  2 accounts. The next quarter promo use stash account to join  next next quarter use UOB One account to join again.,btohqsg
Ya that what i mean by need to rotate if got 200k loh  one time uob one and next time uob stash,btohqsg
can get 4.88% easily if u know how. Not going to share more than that.,btohqsg
Oh I didn't rotate  just put additional money in. I think first 2 promo of the year still got the cause of the total relationship balance with UOB must maintained. Only the recently promo removed the clause.Besides  UOB One account normal interest rate at 5% is more than stash+promo which was at 4.75% for last round promo. So not worth to move  fund from UOB One to Stash.,btohqsg
Use another account possible? It means put 100K at uob stash account,btohqsg
"afternoon all..anyone knows how the UOB TMRW app calculates the stash account's  ""Balance To Maintain"" LOLthanks thanks",btohqsg
It just last month's MAB  round up the nearest dollar.,btohqsg
my figure keeps going down everyday...lol,btohqsg
Because you current account balance is more than the Balance to maintain. So effective you are increasing your this month's MAB  so the rest of the month no need to keep so much.,btohqsg
wah jialad..then how ar?fasterly withdraw till 100k is left inside?,btohqsg
withdraw till u are sure u are able to clock the required MAB for the month,btohqsg
that's where i got lost... whilst trying to figure out how they count the MAB..haha,btohqsg
Make sure u double check the Payment Type in DBS App,btohqsg
Does anyone know when you pay with Kris+ linked to UOB Krisflyer card  kris+ will convert the txn into online txn? Meaning we can get 3mpd for uob Krisflyer after $800min spent in SIA,btohqsg
It varies  u can check on Trust app after payment,btohqsg
Uob krisflyer link to kris plus should earn 3mpd automatically,btohqsg
There are only 2 criteria for Stash account to get max interest. MAB > 100K and MAB >= last month MAB.For 2nd criteria  you can just follow the iBanking 'balance to maintain' for that day and remain the amount for the rest of the month.For the 1st criteria  you can use an excel to calculate what will be your MAB given the current month transactions that already happened and any foreseeable transactions that going to happen.Then you take the greater number from the 2 calculations.,btohqsg
Why make stash so complicated? Just deposit the money into the account from first day of the month no withdrawal  you will get the interest once mature by month. That is how the account is designed. It is a flexible to increase account balance type of Fixed deposit account.Any withdrawal will lose your interest.,btohqsg
Can redraw the bonus interest on the day it is credited (1st day of the month). If redraw on a later date  need to use excel to calculate and check ibanking info too.,btohqsg
ya sia..jialad...i withdrew not on the 1st day...on the 4th..alamk,btohqsg
The uob ndp promotion  when are they giving back my earmarked money,btohqsg
Do we know if they use EoD balance  or even count intraday balance? For example  the balance dipped below due to a GIRO deduction  but I topped it back up on same day before 10pm.,btohqsg
To make your life easy  not recommend to use UOB one for GIRO deduction if you want to use it for Promo.,btohqsg
Yes will earn 3miles. But must also see the MCC code. Like hotel restuarant Or even Klook wont have 3miles.but hard to see la cos their bonus miles only come in at the end of your card cycle,btohqsg
Fast transfer cut off time for UOB is 1030pm from Monday to Saturday. Sunday and PH will be next biz day.,btohqsg
Hi  just wondering if anyone got approved for the cimb cc (singsaver -ps5 promo)? Keep calling cs and they still reviewing,btohqsg
Can anybody share which account do u use to clock giro payment  for the purpose of cashback/interest?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA for the 1% rebate. Income tax  property tax  dbs/uob/other credit cards.,btohqsg
the TNC should state when your earmark ends,btohqsg
everything via kris+ should get 3mpd on uob kf,btohqsg
Really? Even Harvey Norman which is not in the MCC?,btohqsg
yes as per the TnC. dun even need to clock $800 SIA to get 3mpd on Kris+,btohqsg
Oh wow ya. Just saw the TnC. They changed it recently cos last time I saw it was exclude,btohqsg
hm  what u mean by exclude?,btohqsg
Hi guys. Any one using UOB Infinite metal card? Is it worth for anything?,btohqsg
You can read on milelion articles. My personal take is it is useful only for affluent ppl and also pair with other Uob cards.,btohqsg
Excluded from the minimum 800 / yr qualifying spend.Last time that is.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone is a L priviledge member and has NTUC member linked to the L priviledge account? Is the x1.5 points awarded immediately? And is it for all transactions or only ntuc fairprice transactions?,btohqsg
I want to get a Union Pay card to travel to China  since many places don't accept Visa and Master Card. Is the UOB Union Pay Platinium a good card?I see they charge 3.25% transaction fees + probably a bad exchange rate.Does anyone know any better alternative?,btohqsg
For mainland China  you are better of using Alipay or Wechatpay,btohqsg
5% Cashback on Online using DBS Live CC via Kris+and 5% Cashback on Visa Contactless Spend via PaywaveDid i interpret correctly?,btohqsg
$400 is the max for both categories in terms of cashback,btohqsg
Hmmm i read that it was $20 cap for each  which mean max $400 spend each?,btohqsg
Yea  minimum $600 spend in total,btohqsg
visa currency converter with 0% bank fee,btohqsg
Yeah but if I link my visa or master card with Alipay  I have the same issue. Many vendors won't accept it.,btohqsg
? why wont they accept alipay?,btohqsg
Huh? Why? To the vendors you are just using wechat pay or Alipay  sure they will accept. Even beggers (if you see any) on the road accepts wechat pay.. üòÖ,btohqsg
Alipay not use QR code scan? How come Visa and Mastercard involved?,btohqsg
It depends on the payment card you have linked into the app. If it's visa or mastercard  some local outlets won't accept it  hence why I want a Union Pay card,btohqsg
Use ichange still the best so far‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Its really race to the bottom now on these rates,btohqsg
HAHA‚Ä¶ might consider buying a house there since can‚Äôt afford here. üòÇ,btohqsg
Does Apple actually produces iPhone 15 Pro Max with 128GB variant?,btohqsg
Should be a typo error by CIMB?,btohqsg
Hi can anyone recommend a cash back card for big ticket item on retail/online purchase ?,btohqsg
googlepay is the same as paywave for DBS live correct? Confusing üòÇ,btohqsg
Only if you tap your phone,btohqsg
Hi guys  do you know how long it would take to get uob cc for first time applicant,btohqsg
Based on my experience  less than 12 hours,btohqsg
Maybe u can give us a rough estimate?,btohqsg
Others have reported longer times.. so just wait I guess,btohqsg
2 weeks for me  so massive YMMV (had a uob one account with them before signing up too),btohqsg
I was a fresh UOB customer. Opening UOB ONE account was instant  then UOB EVOL less than 12 hours.,btohqsg
if the CC dept has hit its quota maybe they work slower ü´†,btohqsg
Am I new to bank if I have an OCBC Frank debit card?,btohqsg
Ok weird I signed up for the titanium rewards and made the spend before they nerfed the cumulative spend but I haven‚Äôt received the code from bank to let into MoneySmart for the freebies,btohqsg
not sure I understand. you signed up for OCBC TR through moneysmart and are looking for the application ID to submit to moneysmart?,btohqsg
Nope  I‚Äôm trying to claim the rewards now but the Moneysmart site says need a code from OCBC to verify that I hit the criteria,btohqsg
I have deposited and participated in UOB Christmas promo. How to check if I successfully participated the UOB Christmas promo,btohqsg
I did it with SingSaver recently. So it will take OCBC sometime to send you via SMS I think. For Singsaver  they emailed me about 1 week later to fill up a Google Form and that‚Äôs where I put my reward code. Still waiting for the reward from Singsaver. Not sure if it‚Äôs the same for MoneySmart,btohqsg
Hi experts. Can I check where's the best place if I want to place 80k for 2 months? Shld I just open maribank 2.88% and throw $75k there? 3 months fixed deposit will not make it in time for funds use in Feb.,btohqsg
I don't have uob account. So I open and just put 80k there for 2 months? How much will I earn?,btohqsg
Doesn't work for me. Have to salary credit  spend on cc and do Giro just to get the %. Too much hassle for 2 months of interest.,btohqsg
CIMB fast saver lor..3.5% for first 6 months..but no lock period..u can withdraw after 2 months when u need it,btohqsg
Haha shag! I'm alr a fastsaver account holder. Opened 5 years ago.,btohqsg
So I don't get the 3.5% right?,btohqsg
Looks like maribank 2.88% is the only choice now. Somemore interest credited everyday.I've looked around but can't find any leh. Unless someone here got better idea. Haha see if anyone got ideas tmr morning.,btohqsg
think u misread my posts as well as the TnC. Can get 3mpd on Kris+ without any min spend  but Kris+ dun clock towards the $800 SIA group spend.,btohqsg
Moomooo. Need to take a risk.,btohqsg
Buy shares? This 80k I need in Feb.,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/149116Check with Chris for more details.,btohqsg
Alternatively  UOB Stash ?Maribank can withdraw anytime. 2.88%.,btohqsg
Can consider BOC. They have 2mths at 2.9% 3mths @ 3.6%,btohqsg
Thanks for this! I think they change to 1 Month 2.9%. Just googled their promo rates,btohqsg
May i check uob evol use on public transport need to link with contactless or can just tap the card to qualify for the 8% rebate?,btohqsg
Yes many weeks ago  but my family members yet to receive ‚Ä¶ been more than a month for them  but my colleague gotten her card within the same week of application ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Anyone knows what happens to a UOB savings account that has no money in it  left unattended for 5 years?I can‚Äôt seem to get through a CSO to find out if it has been terminated or left dormant indefinitely until funds are transferred in again.,btohqsg
If that UOB account has a minimum balance requirement  then there will be a fall below fee which makes your balance negative  which will in turn attract the overdraft fee. Currently I have to keep 1k in each of my 3 unused UOB accounts.,btohqsg
The minimum balance is $500. The account definitely will be negative and incur an overdraft fee. Does this fee continue piling up under my name or will the account be closed?,btohqsg
Nova launcher is now deemed as a risky app by many bank apps like DBS and UOB. Any way to fix  or must always do the assessibility change each time you need to open bank app?,btohqsg
Yes  OP mentioned he is existing customer,btohqsg
Yes those fees will pile up with interest charged. I was horrified when I saw those fees and quickly top up account back to minimum balance of exactly 1k each account. Little did I know I would kenna another round of fees end of month so my 1k got deducted and is below minimum balance again but I wasn't aware hence got charged fee again. So it's a vicious cycle.,btohqsg
My bad  then 3.5% interest is for the incremental fresh funds. The rest gets the base 1.5% interest rate.I closed my accounts quite some time back and reopened for the promo‚Ä¶ but it seems I‚Äôm considered as an existing customer getting the 1.5% rate‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Blacklisting by UOB. Faster go appeal ASAP before account closure. Your hsbc also received this letter?,btohqsg
Time to consolidate my funds and close accounts that I can‚Äôt maintain anymore to avoid this then.I‚Äôm guessing that if remain unattended  they will empty out the account and then close it‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I actually want to close my accounts but UOB asked me to write in via physical mail or visit branch. So I am really happy UOB auto close because I don't need to use UOB accounts.,btohqsg
But this letter is a blacklisting  in future cannot come back again even 100 years later,btohqsg
I don't want to go near UOB with a 10 ft pole üòÇ,btohqsg
If my spending mainly is only on mobile contactless spending  is UOB EVOL card still a good card?,btohqsg
Ouch‚Ä¶ UOB isn‚Äôt as efficient as it perceived to be. I‚Äôve been waiting to cancel my cards with them but they kept on delaying‚Ä¶Even so harder when asking for a credit limit increase.,btohqsg
Hi everyone . Any suggestions on platform to buy s&p 500?,btohqsg
Anyone has tried using OctaFX platform? What‚Äôs the verdict compared to other brokers?,btohqsg
I'm using Nova Launcher Prime  just checked my banking apps and there aren't any issues  just a data point fyi,btohqsg
hi  very random question. i have the following cards. citi premiermiles  citi rewards  cimb visa infinite card  instarem amaze card.what's an easy way to do card spending (like get the most miles or cashback back  in +ev value  i travel often too  but dont mind cashback just as it is)  (i spend 5-10k a month)  mixed variety of stuff.for now retail spending i have instarem amaze card paired with citi rewards card...for online shld i use premiermiles or rewards? or what's the best strategy. haha.for retail shld i stick with amaze+rewards or change to amaze+premiermiles?thanks for reading!,btohqsg
Hi  masters. For uob one account 500 spending  can I ask if it is according to transaction date or post date. Let‚Äôs say if I bought some thing at 31th November and it is posted on 3rd December  does it consider spending on November or December?,btohqsg
Many thanks. So for transaction like this  it will be considered a spending on December?,btohqsg
Hi experts  anybody sign up for heymax? If use heymax to vouchers  it can clock towards credit card spending?,btohqsg
think u should apply more 4mpd-6mpd cards or cashback cards with high earn rate like maybank family and friends  citi cashback  uob evol (but cashback cards need to meet min spend). Idea is to spend on cards that give most miles/cashback and meet min spend.,btohqsg
UoB daily limit can transfer 100k?,btohqsg
max can transfer out 100k per person per day,btohqsg
Nope. It is now up to 200k,btohqsg
Great  finally the review it  guess too many people feedback on the limit,btohqsg
thanks probably apply for the citi cashback and throw everything there,btohqsg
no ah  citi cashback (not citi cashback+) has cashback limits of $80 only,btohqsg
should have had my 31 November copyrighted and trademarked! hahaha,btohqsg
abit of reading  like all the 4-6mpd card like got cap per month. abit lazy.  maybe 1 max  then throw the rest into another card...,btohqsg
why not be just a tiny bit hardworking to get 3-4 times the miles,btohqsg
How long does it usually take to receive credit card after applying? (HSBC / UOB / OCBC) As a new customer,btohqsg
3 working days for me to receive the physical card (UOB). HSBC / OCBC im not sure. Sorry!,btohqsg
Citi reward better or uob vs? For oversea spending,btohqsg
how much? include travel related spend like hotel?,btohqsg
Can uob virtual cc (approved and pending mail) still be added to googlepay without security code using uob tmrw app? Used to have android phone and added before. Option wasnt available for applepay,btohqsg
How to pay SG QR using credit card? Apple Pay fromXNAP?,btohqsg
yeah 1 of the way provided its accepted,btohqsg
I have been looking out for the Sgqr code at hawker centre.  So far no success.  Scan with xnap which always said not supported.  Is xnap really so popular?,btohqsg
Yeah  my house kopitiam also have it.Which hawker u go? The ones I usually go is Bukit Merah or Henderson,btohqsg
I only enter my uob one account into Google pay.  No configuration needed at xnap  right?  So far serangoon area.,btohqsg
Any max limit UoB card can have for one person? I read that Citi max 5,btohqsg
The SGQR need to have xnap/liquidpay logo for Xnap to work,btohqsg
can use Amaze card (with citi rewards mc linked as default card) to get 4mpd for max $1000,btohqsg
Will kena the stupid fees or not. Amaze damn not flexible with the waive,btohqsg
Is my procedure correct?  Ie  configure google pay with my uob one.  Then just download xnap and scan using it.  It will auto recognise whatever I configured in Google pay  right?,btohqsg
You cna choose Gpay as your default in xnap. After scanning  using xnap you can choose which cards to pay. It's the list of cards within your Gpay,btohqsg
no fees for overseas spend  can get instapoints also,btohqsg
OK.  I didn't even go thru successfully the scanning.  Will try again some other day.  Thks.,btohqsg
Shd monitor. Sometimes QR error or network issue. I had a few times where I was double charged...,btohqsg
Anyone have any experience if one is able to receive sms otp from banking app (uob/citibank) when overseas using Zym mobile plan?,btohqsg
Hi guys  my parents have a joint savings account with uob and have a credit card link to the account that bear both of their names. So are they both considered principal card holders? and if lets say my mom applies for krisflyer cc will she get the 20k miles (gift) and 5k miles (welcome)?,btohqsg
Is uob lady card still worth after feb 2024?Just appliedOnly certain category earn 4miles per dollar,btohqsg
can use it as a travel card with 4mpd. Very little cards offer 4mpd for travel category,btohqsg
Hi guys I am looking to open a new savings account without any savings should I use uob one or ocbc 360,btohqsg
Recommend UOB one  lesser hoops to jump through compared to OCBC,btohqsg
Nova Launcher Prime user  enabled accessibility  does not get flagged as risky. Downloaded from Google Play.Unless your app is downloaded off Google Play?,btohqsg
Then you are maxed out at $20 cashback. Totally no online spending? Shopee  Grab  Foodpanda  Amazon  McDonald's  Fairprice  Gojek  etc.,btohqsg
What do you mean by ‚Äúwithout any saving‚Äù?There is a fall below fee for such accounts. I think the minimum saving amount is $3k.,btohqsg
$20/$600 = 3.33% cashback for pure mobile contactless  same as DBS Live Fresh. Good that there is no specific MCC to follow.,btohqsg
Okay I am able to save that amount because from videos I hear them all talking about 30-75k which I do not have :),btohqsg
Online spending.. if use ntuc apps to pay directly is counted?,btohqsg
Yes counted. Use Fairprice app  use McDonald's app.,btohqsg
Check uob one n ocbc 360 interest rate on website. $500 monthly spend  on credit card may be the key factor to decide which one you shall choose.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not a person who keep travel frequentlyUse for dining and transport most suitableDaily usage,btohqsg
Anyone tried using amaze contactless payment at Malaysia before? Does it works or need to insert the card?,btohqsg
But amaze I only turn on in-store purchase and overseas.,btohqsg
Need to turn on online or magstripe features?,btohqsg
Get ready another credit card as a backup. Amaze is not always work when using physical card. It may fail n CSO can‚Äôt explain to you where it failed.,btohqsg
true story  i went in w my BIL he bought something quite pricey  turns out for some reason  amaze cannot go through  i gotta help him pay,btohqsg
Alternative card should be Youtrip I suppose?,btohqsg
