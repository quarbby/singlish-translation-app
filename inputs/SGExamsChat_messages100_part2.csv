Q hard to get in though,btohqsg
Tbh I have no idea what a lot of majors learn lol,btohqsg
You know ur comp sci can liao,btohqsg
Biz probably teach you how to manage a business but not the process of starting one lol,btohqsg
You want learn entrepreneurship can join noc lorh,btohqsg
So multi variable calculus and stuff I Guess,btohqsg
Something chim sounding like stochastic calculus,btohqsg
Just self study a little before hand and then go in,btohqsg
Hopefully get a good grade so it actually counts towards the CAP,btohqsg
I think only my H3 will be APC,btohqsg
I don't really have access to the module papers anyway  for practice,btohqsg
Youâ€™re not doing physics in Uni,btohqsg
Would it matter that you took H3 physics,btohqsg
FoS has a faculty requirement to complete some mods,btohqsg
Basically 6 different groups of mods  choose 4,btohqsg
Cs have 1 sci mod requirement also eh,btohqsg
CS  Chem  Life science  physics  math  multidisciplinary,btohqsg
Actually that one I not very sure,btohqsg
Cause according to the website if take ddp,btohqsg
If u take ddp it is auto counted,btohqsg
Just take any of ur 2k math mod as sci requirement lorh,btohqsg
Students pursuing a double degree in Computer Science and Mathematics/Applied Mathematics or Second Major in Mathematics/Statistics will take ST2131 Probability and ST2132 Mathematical Statistics in place of ST2334 Probability and Statistics. Students pursuing a Second Major in Statistics will take ST2131 in place of ST2334.,btohqsg
2334 got v steep bell curve,btohqsg
So ST2334 (4 MCs) becomes ST2131 and ST2132 (8 MCs total),btohqsg
I'm not sure where the additional 4 MCs will go to,btohqsg
2334 is a pretty crap mod also,btohqsg
I assume its the one science module lol,btohqsg
Ur st2131 is used to replace 2334,btohqsg
Ur 2132 is counted as a sci requirement,btohqsg
yeah so no need to double count the h3 physics,btohqsg
U should do 2104 before doing 2131,btohqsg
The moe one is on modern phy,btohqsg
2131 uses alot of double integrals which is taught in 2104,btohqsg
sia la i guess also get correct,btohqsg
Line and surface is triple integral liao,btohqsg
my head still cant wrap around multivar,btohqsg
then all the transformation. line to surface  surface to volume,btohqsg
I did NUS PC1144 for my H3,btohqsg
It's an introduction to modern physics,btohqsg
Special relativity  quantum physics and mechanics and nuclear physics,btohqsg
Is there still h3 linear algebra now,btohqsg
to learn quantum need learn linear is it,btohqsg
i tot all the computation is in matrix form,btohqsg
The one that need linear algebra is quantum computing,btohqsg
There was a bit of matrices in special relativity,btohqsg
i need fing some time relearn linear al and multivar,btohqsg
Mvc is ok until they started on line and surface integrals,btohqsg
mine started from line and surface,btohqsg
thats why from the start i mind blown le,btohqsg
ok forget it im not a engineering dude anymore,btohqsg
