text,group
would you rather be in a camp filled with vj students or yijc students?,btohqsg
yea usually those is like adjunct somewhere or both,btohqsg
ok I feel offended u oak fuck,btohqsg
just not be in a camp,btohqsg
Do u stay grad halls or go back home?,btohqsg
At least don't complain when asked to do menial task,btohqsg
"Vj student: ""bro I can ask my maid to do this why must I do this""",btohqsg
doesn‚Äôt have to be vj what,btohqsg
Say it's not worth his time,btohqsg
for me i stay home bc i work on theory and my prof doesn't care about me being in office every day. so i just go to campus for meetings,btohqsg
And it's the third vj student,btohqsg
I mean like not only vj ppl act like that,btohqsg
are you j1 j2 or alumni,btohqsg
"""gurl ate and left no crumbs"" type ahh",btohqsg
can you tell me more about our school,btohqsg
You do PhD rite? Did u do a MA before or u smart enough to jump to PhD?,btohqsg
Charlotte lee won't be leaving anytime soon I hope,btohqsg
jump straight. not smart or not smart la. it's a lot easier to jump for STEM,btohqsg
Someone in my class flunk his phone to the floor aft losing fun run,btohqsg
I think yijc is the most elite school to exist. focus on yourself and you‚Äôll be fine. if u want to mess around teh options are there for u. if not  you‚Äôre in good hands. just get external practice for yourself,btohqsg
Anyways tmr I'm get5ing 3 more vj students,btohqsg
Maybe I'll get to interact wth someone who thinks that doing work is not beneath him,btohqsg
"Just cuz he got ""90 rp""",btohqsg
it's better to go yijc than ri cos yes,btohqsg
Ngl I am jealous usually for CoHASS we have to do a MA or just have a really good topic that matches with an Prof.,btohqsg
if not u can also hear wonderfully crafted speeches from the principal,btohqsg
benefits of yijc:1. de silva2. de silva3. overseas trips4. it's a jc5. p,btohqsg
yea sounds about right. but academia for CoHASS vs CoS/CoE also v different as a whole,btohqsg
no I think 5 will scare people into coming yijc,btohqsg
what did I do to u,btohqsg
leave me alone I did my vectors,btohqsg
To start yall actually have funding lmao,btohqsg
p if one leg of a triangle is 4m and the other leg is 3m  what is the hypothenuse,btohqsg
man i hate vectors so much,btohqsg
3 is available in every jc,btohqsg
vectors is the most insane topic to be on right now for a j1,btohqsg
early do means more time to understand,btohqsg
because i heard ri is also on vectors,btohqsg
I hv given all back to the teacher,btohqsg
Maybe he isn't saying that he's saying his surname... wong,btohqsg
yea they recently revamped the ntu research scholarship and there's now a diff stipend grade for stem vs others üíÄ,btohqsg
yea they do vectors around this time,btohqsg
ri is like functions and graphs stuff  equations and inequalities  then vectors alr,btohqsg
we haven't even started on functions dawg,btohqsg
I love AC so much!!! ac boleh,btohqsg
they only have in person stuff for tutorials,btohqsg
Wait do research fellows get paid or isit just an extended PhD.,btohqsg
honestly should just go poly if you‚Äôre lectured online LOL,btohqsg
But for research? Gotcha so I am assuming u gotta publish if not u get fired rite?,btohqsg
so in ri they dont even need to go to their lecture halls?,btohqsg
i think every jc is like that no?,btohqsg
this is why vjc is my number 1 copium,btohqsg
there's no idiot xmm to scream in ur face,btohqsg
tbf there's no diff if it's just lectures. online can just rewatch but must have own discipline to do it,btohqsg
i mean ri only has classes mon tues thurs fri,btohqsg
RP.. what the fuck is a lecture,btohqsg
their wed is solely for extra enrichment/cca,btohqsg
at least they have credible departments,btohqsg
But like ngl I never saw a lecture theatre in use for academic knowledge until my first day in NTU,btohqsg
just watch khan academy the organic chemistry tutor professor leonard,btohqsg
But wed no class is alternate,btohqsg
that‚Äôs the problem w me lor,btohqsg
you can't spell problem without p,btohqsg
Uk what i did for a lecture i missed,btohqsg
i mean tbh just handle the projects well you're gonna publish most likely,btohqsg
he shit talks bedok the most,btohqsg
I copy fr my friend the blanks and self-read,btohqsg
Prolly don't even know what projection actually is,btohqsg
yes for ri  wed is a gap day for ccas + enrichment + portfolio building,btohqsg
Help why is it so weird,btohqsg
Even still I asked my Prof and its damn anal for which journal cuz NTU is damn particular about impact scores,btohqsg
anyway in uni my online lectures i only ever watched for specific mods,btohqsg
In tm wed is a start late end early day,btohqsg
really depends on the lecture material,btohqsg
So u gotta publish in a approved journal if not you just wasted your research,btohqsg
sometimes i only watch parts for clarification,btohqsg
the rest read textbook or notes,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why got so much time find ppl for lunch,btohqsg
Oh nvm I thought jc had a sports day every week,btohqsg
or perhaps u saw it as sports day but it‚Äôs actl just cca,btohqsg
i mean now my commitments are tues  wed  fri and all end by 1+,btohqsg
Why u never offer me lunch I very sad liao,btohqsg

Those people were ppl i considered friends and trusted. I dont have any emotional connections to this person so she cant hurt me at all,btohqsg
her: üòÅüëãüö™after the door broke:her: üòÅüëç,btohqsg
She greets some of the boys from her y3y4 class,btohqsg
step 1: be a boystep 2: go back to y3y4,btohqsg
imagine the reason for expulsion was door abuse,btohqsg
how dare you abuse an inanimate object,btohqsg

cjc  acjc and yijc slander is allowed,btohqsg
ac uniform is very pretty btw,btohqsg
"idw to hear ""omg acjc girls are sooo wife material why am i not in acjc""",btohqsg

yeah that was the best part,btohqsg
then in sec 4 i had a class jacket that i will never ever wear outside,btohqsg
my subjects are:H10 complainingH30 sleepingH50 mixed feelingsH40 random 4am leg crampsH60 delusion,btohqsg
bc the name i print on the back is stupid,btohqsg
so i feel embarrassed wearing outside,btohqsg
I would never print a meme name honestly,btohqsg
"in sec 1 class tee i go put ""eva01"" in the back bc",btohqsg
ok i can't rmb what sch it was,btohqsg
I shld had brought this yr la damnit,btohqsg

I rarely hear of ppl buying sia,btohqsg
idk i just need more long pants things,btohqsg
Ya most ppl FR just get the jacket,btohqsg
tdy i stained my white top,btohqsg
maybe when sg starts having winter,btohqsg
now i worried if i buy cygnus shirt,btohqsg
usually when yall buy cca shirt,btohqsg
urr makers nvr make cca shirt,btohqsg
i was very shocked to learn that,btohqsg
Nah tbh idk what my exco doing,btohqsg
Budden idk what happened aft that,btohqsg
we were supposed to buy cca shirt,btohqsg
then whatever reason they didn't buy,btohqsg
It's safety glasses in front btw,btohqsg
"1 year pass and they just give us plain black shirt with ""speech and drama"" in the front and big fat ""CREW"" in the back",btohqsg
I swear it's not that nerd,btohqsg
I swear it's not that nerdüíÄ,btohqsg

"idk if i tripping but i rmb very briefly i saw the text ""tmjc orientation 2022""",btohqsg
Yay no need do stupid booth alrd,btohqsg

If U legit end up cca exco ah,btohqsg
U prolly need to do a booth for,btohqsg
Assuming they do same shit as last yr,btohqsg
Which urr considering TM is tm,btohqsg

I can‚Äôt find my phew phew shirt,btohqsg
I regret not buying my Hanoi goglobal one,btohqsg
I would feel hurt if close friends nvr wish sure,btohqsg
Plus isn't it btr to be wished sincerely rather than obligation lol,btohqsg
Who's interview ended and why is that news tho.,btohqsg
If not friends nah bruh what the,btohqsg
I use roller with backing but idk the brand,btohqsg
just one from ikea. gonna get a more ergonomic one soonish tho,btohqsg
spend way too much time working at my desk to not,btohqsg
I think you should get a proper sitting chair,btohqsg
you upgrade your desk  pc and all but not your chair...,btohqsg
But I think backrest very important tho,btohqsg
I bopian cuz room no space,btohqsg
Oh true it does takes up a lot of space,btohqsg
this is just what i use rn la,btohqsg
But idk I feel like my mum is right that my biological age is 10y older  when I sit without backrest  legit my back hurts,btohqsg
Actually no diff also in 1 month it will pancake out cuz the backing is too hard.,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like slowing down the aging process for yt,btohqsg
Aging will happen anyways what Si Yan,btohqsg
But what help can the cushion do tho,btohqsg
Bro your cupboard peeling off alr,btohqsg
There is only tat much it can help u with,btohqsg
But honestly I feel that that stool is not comfortable even with a cushion there‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Looks like plywood ig gorilla glue,btohqsg
nah the white part just has a piece broken off,btohqsg
i‚Äôll probs get ergotune those style when my budget allows,btohqsg
Also bro you wallet stacked sia,btohqsg
bro you nitpicking my entire room LOL,btohqsg
Wait are they really no money,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt keep any cash lol,btohqsg
Both in band and nusco  we have proper chair just that I dun get to sit coz I percussion lmao,btohqsg
Oh u mean that I tot what y‚Äôall need sit on stools,btohqsg
Later someone fall off the chair,btohqsg
same but i just keep them on me. then got condo access card  drivers licence  matric card,btohqsg
Actually during cca  I think one of the huqin idk what but nearly fell off the chair,btohqsg
If anyone takes my wallet its just a pain in the ass for my to fill up the paperwork to replace my documents,btohqsg
Bruh idk it was in the middle of the song and then I was just holding off my laughter,btohqsg
i have 8 in my wallet. tbh only matric card is annoying,btohqsg
the rest just go bank app cancel and get new one only,btohqsg
It's the rolling type of stool,btohqsg
if i lose my physical one i won‚Äôt bother getting new one alr,btohqsg
So I kept spining and it just spun out,btohqsg
Oh ya I always just bring my phone,btohqsg
Both can use phone is just still need the physical one by law ig,btohqsg
Idk why I suddenly get headache again,btohqsg
Yes  i will get nausea too,btohqsg
Try getting abortive medication from your doctor,btohqsg
I hv been lazy clearing my wallet  so have all the old old receipts still there,btohqsg
Usually if I feel and impending one it's possible to take it to lessen the pain and personally the auras,btohqsg
The thing is I dun actually know if it is a normal tension headache or migraine headache but a normal tension headache typically does not come with nausea,btohqsg
Ah. Then it's possible to just take it when it certain also as well but it is less effective,btohqsg
I always have to take medications before exam,btohqsg
If I dun take medication before exam  I will get a headache,btohqsg
And then sometimes I even put x oil on my table,btohqsg
but need to pay for it if you lose it and stuff,btohqsg
Sounds like a stress induced trigger,btohqsg
3 times u need to go to court,btohqsg
There was once in the middle of the paper I got giddy,btohqsg
And swear that u are just stupid not committing fraud,btohqsg
Luckily I had x oil on my table,btohqsg
Why is safekeeping ic so difficult,btohqsg
Usually I know it will come if I start feeling lightheaded,btohqsg
It has been in one place and I dun really take it out coz I usually use SingPass,btohqsg
Sometimes I can predict it so I put a bit of oil first,btohqsg
Not rlly la just some ppl forgetful lor,btohqsg
Coz have u heard of medication overuse headache,btohqsg
Ok la but I dun think I will even come close to that extreme coz I dun eat naproxen / Nurofen EOD basis,btohqsg
Use sparingly basically. But abortive medications don't work by reducing pain,btohqsg
In fact it doesn't do shit for that it just limits the extent,btohqsg
But I dun want to also be resistant to NSAIDs  my headache already resistant to Panadol,btohqsg
Then another one in 2h if dun help,btohqsg
Cuz its vasoconstriction for abortive medication,btohqsg
No la if u do a proper pain workup usually they will attempt to lower your BP,btohqsg
And then migraines are mainly cause by vasodilation of your brains bloodvessels so the abortive medication does the opposite lor,btohqsg
Bruh I can‚Äôt have any more lower bp,btohqsg
If still got pain then take painkillers if needed,btohqsg
Then they might put you on medication to increase it,btohqsg
I usually use x oil first,btohqsg
Too low is not good too high not good depends on which side u on either ways not good,btohqsg
If it is really bad then i take nurofen / naproxen,btohqsg
But idk if it is frequent i should go and visit a doctor and not be on painkillers all the time,btohqsg
U won't tho not ideal to do so anyways its more on managing the root cause.,btohqsg
Which most of the time is BP,btohqsg
Ah is it  coz headache has 10001 reasonsüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
That's the trigger reason but physically and structurally it's just blood flow,btohqsg
From a purely physicalist perspective its just oh not normal make it normal  that should make it ok,btohqsg
Anyone have a list of electives with open slots?,btohqsg
yea i just meant those ergonomic style of office chairs,btohqsg
just give me at that point,btohqsg
ok give me one  give yt the other,btohqsg
ok nvm just give me one then,btohqsg
can you bear to watch your good friend yt remain on a stool,btohqsg
i thought i was being more direct,btohqsg
at least your table not sinking alr,btohqsg
so when he gets a gf she got somewhere to sit while he work,btohqsg
you got one of those conference room meeting tables is it,btohqsg
i screwed a rod into my desk,btohqsg
you haven't assembled your fucking chairs,btohqsg
