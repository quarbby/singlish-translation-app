yes  but bc of the war in gaza  pro palestinians decide to boycott USA companies,btohqsg
not just USA but businesses supported/invested/back by Israel & it's citizens,btohqsg
Tbh even if we dont buy starbucks its not gonna make a difference,btohqsg
no one really cares in a country like singapore,btohqsg

iirc last i heard as to boycott the three main companies that are pro-Isrealstarbucksdisneymcdonalds,btohqsg
i never bought starbucks drinks anyways,btohqsg
anyone knows a place where i can practice sci practical at a reasonable cost,btohqsg
actl a lot of people boycott starbucks under the belief that the boycott was for palestine,btohqsg
in actual fact the boycott was started because they felt injustice over the starbucks worker union leader being fired for sharing their stance on being pro-palestine,btohqsg
I managed to score well for sci practical even without prior practice during a school exam,btohqsg
Hmm didnt know you were here as well,btohqsg

Asking about NUSI am an Egyptian student who is currently in high school I will finish after 1 year  I really want to apply to this University because I know it is the suitable university for meI want to apply for a scholarship for a double degree in BBA(bachelor in Business administration) and BSC(bachelor in Computer science)I have already searched a lot about this university but all the data I found is that it is v v hard to join I don't know If my skills fit their requirements and I also found that it has a 5% acceptance rate onlyIf anyone here got accepted into it can help me and tell me what they requireMy knowledge I started learning German and Python since 2020 and stopped in 2023 I have a B1 in German and good knowledge of Python and in 2023 started learning solidity and knew the fundamentals My prediction for my final high school year is a 4.0 GPA and my IELTS score 6.5 this is my expectations based on my ability and free tests,btohqsg
Minimum admission requirement for IELTS is 7.0 average.4.0 out of ?. GPA is not exactly a standardised measure.I recommend you take SAT and/or ACTs to supplement your GPA.,btohqsg
Ok np I will retake IeltsI didn't take a exam I just converted my expectations in last high school year to GPA which is a grading systemBut should I take Act or Sat ?,btohqsg
Applicants with international qualification will be considered for admission based on one of the following:a) At least 5 AP courses; orb) ACT with Writing  and at least 3 AP courses; orc) SAT  and at least 3 AP courses,btohqsg
Advanced Placement Test also admistered by the College Board,btohqsg
So I should look at college board website,btohqsg
Yes. For registration and administration of the tests.,btohqsg
So if I made Sat and took 5 Ap courses I will have a big advantage or what,btohqsg
Cuz I want to have an opportunity,btohqsg
No. Uqualifyyou are already automatically at a disadvantage because u are a foreigner.,btohqsg
Ah sh so how to have an advantage,btohqsg
I already have 1 year that I can sort things for myself,btohqsg
Sir do you know a method so I can see my acceptance rate,btohqsg
you have a very low chance of getting accepted at NUS honestly speaking,btohqsg
maybe at other universities  it's possible,btohqsg
I still have 1 year I can do anything in it and I can take 1 year gap,btohqsg
But I want to know what to do to have high acceptance rate,btohqsg
but need years of experience or volunteering job,btohqsg
If u don't hit the minimum entry requirements don't bother lmao,btohqsg
U have to at least qualify lmao,btohqsg
minimum to enter nus is 3.2,btohqsg
