dealer is called Cartell  they are at Revv,btohqsg
its a COE Mazda 3  16 years. but the PPI revealed damage beyond the usual wear and tear,btohqsg
Number plate? Maybe can search at sgrv,btohqsg
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è what is usual for a 16 year old car,btohqsg
I took it to a Mazda specialist who had seen lots and he said he had never seen damage like that on the underside before,btohqsg
Bro I saw your post at reddit,btohqsg
any workshop claiming to be mazda specialist unless they are doing rotary engines  quite laughable,btohqsg
more likely than not they trying to carrot you to repair everything,btohqsg
Maybe I phrased wrongly. Just a workshop that services lots of Mazda's,btohqsg
No  I looked up past reviews and their history.,btohqsg
Least I can do is warn others üòî,btohqsg
chassis not affected leh liar liar pants on fire,btohqsg
but now that i know the whole story you can go report them to case or take any legal action you want i'm pretty sure you won't win a single cent lol,btohqsg
The damages u reported is wear n tear,btohqsg
They can turn ard n sue u for defamation,btohqsg
Nt tht I'm siding the dealer. We all knw how dealer works,btohqsg
U need to use the sales agreement to protect urself,btohqsg
Dealers r nt ur friend. They r doing a Business.,btohqsg
"description never say anything about ""no repairs needed""",btohqsg
16 year old car sure to have some things failing one after another nia,btohqsg

Hi Andrew  Sam here from Cartell. We sent the vehicle to your workshop for the PPI.1. You told my staff that you would like to back out from the deal as the car has too many wear & tear. Our agreement was for engine  gearbox and chassis damage. Afterwards  you changed your story and told us that the workshop claims that the car is an accident unit. I called up the workshop personally and checked. He is unable to confirm that the car is involved in an accident before and ask to seek second opinion from STA (which I suggested to you too)And if they say it's an accident unit I will also fully refund you your deposit.2. This deal I have given you a $2000 discount  1 year warranty for engine and gearbox. Also I have offered to fix up the coolant leaks if there is any. I strongly believe that the $2000 that we have extended to you as a discount is more than sufficient to fix up the wear & tear but you are spinning tales around. I hope you understand I will go to any extent to make sure our reputable name is not tarnished. So pls bring down your defamatory post and let's end this amicably. I have done my part to honour the deal. If you still wish to back out I think it's only fair for us to forfeit the deposit.,btohqsg
"Hi Sam 1. I was uncomfortable to purchase the car because of the damages found by the workshop  not the wear and tear. This was made clear to you and your colleagues.2. I was initially ok to proceed with this purchase if you could fix the issues in the PPI so that I can buy the car in the condition it was advertised i.e. ""meticulously maintained""  ""NEW driveshaft"". Over the phone you also assured us that undercarriage had just been done up because there was ""shakiness and noisiness"" yet there was still damage found.3. The $2000 discount is irrelevant because the condition of the car that was promised is different from what we found to be true after the PPI.",btohqsg
Sam n Andrew  pls take this elsewhere,btohqsg
WAIT.. I think that day I saw him .. not loud leh‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Interesting though to understand facts as the story unfolds. üëçüèº,btohqsg
Always listen to both side of the stories before making any judgement!,btohqsg
Which dealer never copy paste text onto the ads on their listings sia,btohqsg
Condition major problem refund deposit  minor problems can compromise. Oil and coolant leak on a 16 year old car is as common as old man having bad joints,btohqsg
If don't understand that maybe... Buy new car... If cannot afford  better take public transport,btohqsg
Only thing that's over is the deposit,btohqsg
I saw 2 solutions in this  1. They offered to do up the damage then take the car   2. They offered to get a second opinion from STA inspection to confirm your claims  if u are confident u will win that or have the damage done up why not just take it,btohqsg
After its a 16 year old japanese car,btohqsg
And the damage isnt detrimental  its fixable,btohqsg
change mind try to weasel back his  2000 dollars only,btohqsg
not even close to being scam,btohqsg
Sometimes it‚Äôs just down to understanding T&Cs  inclusions/exclusionsclearlybefore signing anything. Do the necessary homework and ask all the questions / concerns one needs upfront before signing. if we can do that for our employers  all the more so we should do when it comes to spending own hard earned money?,btohqsg
Not siding anyone here of coz,btohqsg
Think already quite nice to let him take to his own workshop for PPI ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
when he first put out his statement he straight away say he got scammed.. this kind of thing can be quite damaging to businesses,btohqsg
Not like I own anything but I sometimes wonder  why do people have to place deposit for a PPI if it‚Äôs totally on the buyer‚Äôs cost?,btohqsg
because in this case one of the sales guys drove the car to the buyer's place for him to test drive  drove it to the workshop for PPI  those are costs that the dealership have to bear,btohqsg
if PPI before even placing deposit dealership no need to do business liao,btohqsg
Put it on the buyer lor. Then they buy witht their eyes open. If not car is back to market lor.,btohqsg
PPI for used car is just to ensure no major problem  not to ensure if the dealer is not being honest...,btohqsg
"which dealer will go and put ""has a few leaks"" in the ad",btohqsg
To confirm seriousness of purchase intent  put PPI costs on the buyer. It‚Äôs reasonable and it‚Äôll weed out a lot of talkers already.,btohqsg
then it should be a reasonable request to PPI at a nearby location to dealer,btohqsg
To be fair I hardly see warranty on coolant leak so üëçüèº,btohqsg
but everything is down to agreement between seller and buyer  you willingly enter into agreement  then as long as the terms not being violated you either take the car or fofeit deposit and LLST,btohqsg
already give 2k discount out of a 42k car  and offer to repair flywheel leak which is a big deal,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like saying oh‚Ä¶ this car has a leak.. MUST BE A BMW,btohqsg

https://www.sgcarmart.com/directory/popups/sta_popup.phpTHANK YOU SGCM FOR GIVING US SUCH GREAT RESOURCES!,btohqsg
At first when he say got leaks  i thought he buying BMW,btohqsg
To be fair  there are often buyers who are time wasters too..,btohqsg
Lol quite many would fail and customers walk away,btohqsg
Actually if dealer really fix all defects then put on sale sure loss due to the car age and mileage,btohqsg
Worse  put fixed and customers would think its an accident car,btohqsg
Old cars definitely got issues onr,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just how to previous owner deal with it,btohqsg
Cannot la....got risk of bak kup,btohqsg
Like someone people their golf need overhaul then instead of fixing it  they gonna sell it instead,btohqsg
I would want own workshop lolz,btohqsg

Free installation means more cost needed to cover,btohqsg
Distance based charging   for those that go JB   will they charge ?,btohqsg
They only start it at 2025? Now till then only installation phrase,btohqsg
Shud only charge for use in SG. How can,btohqsg
2025 election . Dun think they are stupid enough to throw away the votes,btohqsg
i think for current cars  just install 2 piece can liao  the touchscreen one can add on if getting a car after 2025,btohqsg
Ya that is why they install till 2025 then erp 2.0 start from 2026,btohqsg
Cannot too fast too furious Liao,btohqsg
I think at first they just charge same rate like our existing erp  but we all know laz eventually will keep increasing,btohqsg
By the time they start the charging   I will sell the car,btohqsg
How is it gonna be 250k,btohqsg
The touch screen will connect to the battery ? Will the car battery used up fast?,btohqsg
I just hoping if they gonna increase the erp in the future  can decrease the arf or smth. So in the 10 years still pay same price,btohqsg
But aiya  I think fat hope,btohqsg
I tot by right w ERP 2.0 suppose to remove coe.. but now seems like they gna keep both.. double taxed lo,btohqsg
Automotive   property  fuel & water  they can suck and suck,btohqsg
How they gonna do it sia  imagine I just get new car with Coe and shit. Then the following year the remove Coe and implement the new system. Like that how sia,btohqsg
Must see how much they charge lor   start engine then start charging Liao ?,btohqsg
Ltr 2cent per km.. one week 700km..,btohqsg
I think more likely $1 per km,btohqsg
Wa i will sell car le,btohqsg
cause if u take average 13k km per year clocked in SG and divide by 130k COE price  roughly same...but this is just a guess ah  don't find me if i guess wrong lol,btohqsg
Really not worth to drive anymore,btohqsg
maybe discounted rate for fleet/taxis thats all,btohqsg
Singapore government got no intention for people to buy car since the implementation of the coe .,btohqsg
If car was cheaper......maybe 3mil cars,btohqsg
What i feel is  COE shld be perm,btohqsg
then subsequent release of coe depends on how many dereg,btohqsg
Coe tag to ic for life. U sell car  ur coe gone. Then cooling period 2yrs before buy next car,btohqsg
Lol non drivers will also hoard coe,btohqsg
Gov allow people to over trade that why now so many people own cars,btohqsg
Just stick to the 30/70 or 40/60 .,btohqsg
U still pay 30/70 ot 40/60,btohqsg
Just tht the loan of the car increases to suit ur 30/70 or 40/60,btohqsg
If nt how u think 100% loan works,btohqsg
Submission to banks n finance coy is nvr 100%,btohqsg
Stil 30/70 or 40/60 at max tenure 7yrs,btohqsg
Just tht if u no money for 30% or 40%  then ur car gets inflated to 30 or 40% more lor,btohqsg
After all coe is forced by the buyer reach the high price,btohqsg
Coe low   every people is happy,btohqsg
U get ur car  i earn my money,btohqsg
My friend recently go to 1 PI to ask . The PI gave him 8.46 % interest,btohqsg
Banks nt stupid to not know a car gets inflated,btohqsg
