dealer is called Cartell  they are at Revv,btohqsg
its a COE Mazda 3  16 years. but the PPI revealed damage beyond the usual wear and tear,btohqsg
Number plate? Maybe can search at sgrv,btohqsg
🤦‍♂️ what is usual for a 16 year old car,btohqsg
I took it to a Mazda specialist who had seen lots and he said he had never seen damage like that on the underside before,btohqsg
Bro I saw your post at reddit,btohqsg
any workshop claiming to be mazda specialist unless they are doing rotary engines  quite laughable,btohqsg
more likely than not they trying to carrot you to repair everything,btohqsg
Maybe I phrased wrongly. Just a workshop that services lots of Mazda's,btohqsg
No  I looked up past reviews and their history.,btohqsg
Least I can do is warn others 😔,btohqsg
chassis not affected leh liar liar pants on fire,btohqsg
but now that i know the whole story you can go report them to case or take any legal action you want i'm pretty sure you won't win a single cent lol,btohqsg
The damages u reported is wear n tear,btohqsg
They can turn ard n sue u for defamation,btohqsg
Nt tht I'm siding the dealer. We all knw how dealer works,btohqsg
U need to use the sales agreement to protect urself,btohqsg
Dealers r nt ur friend. They r doing a Business.,btohqsg
"description never say anything about ""no repairs needed""",btohqsg
16 year old car sure to have some things failing one after another nia,btohqsg
receipts later is 5 years ago one... but also receipt,btohqsg
Oh Mai… no wonder can’t see him. Too fast sir,btohqsg
Make it even la .. 3 more sir,btohqsg
I only can see yours and@arnavgulianione 😂,btohqsg

hearsay already same bhp as GTI,btohqsg
That’s y u need . 700k loan,btohqsg
But loud mah. He can’t escape one,btohqsg
Hi Andrew  Sam here from Cartell. We sent the vehicle to your workshop for the PPI.1. You told my staff that you would like to back out from the deal as the car has too many wear & tear. Our agreement was for engine  gearbox and chassis damage. Afterwards  you changed your story and told us that the workshop claims that the car is an accident unit. I called up the workshop personally and checked. He is unable to confirm that the car is involved in an accident before and ask to seek second opinion from STA (which I suggested to you too)And if they say it's an accident unit I will also fully refund you your deposit.2. This deal I have given you a $2000 discount  1 year warranty for engine and gearbox. Also I have offered to fix up the coolant leaks if there is any. I strongly believe that the $2000 that we have extended to you as a discount is more than sufficient to fix up the wear & tear but you are spinning tales around. I hope you understand I will go to any extent to make sure our reputable name is not tarnished. So pls bring down your defamatory post and let's end this amicably. I have done my part to honour the deal. If you still wish to back out I think it's only fair for us to forfeit the deposit.,btohqsg
"Hi Sam 1. I was uncomfortable to purchase the car because of the damages found by the workshop  not the wear and tear. This was made clear to you and your colleagues.2. I was initially ok to proceed with this purchase if you could fix the issues in the PPI so that I can buy the car in the condition it was advertised i.e. ""meticulously maintained""  ""NEW driveshaft"". Over the phone you also assured us that undercarriage had just been done up because there was ""shakiness and noisiness"" yet there was still damage found.3. The $2000 discount is irrelevant because the condition of the car that was promised is different from what we found to be true after the PPI.",btohqsg
Sam n Andrew  pls take this elsewhere,btohqsg
WAIT.. I think that day I saw him .. not loud leh…,btohqsg
Interesting though to understand facts as the story unfolds. 👍🏼,btohqsg
Always listen to both side of the stories before making any judgement!,btohqsg
Which dealer never copy paste text onto the ads on their listings sia,btohqsg
Condition major problem refund deposit  minor problems can compromise. Oil and coolant leak on a 16 year old car is as common as old man having bad joints,btohqsg
If don't understand that maybe... Buy new car... If cannot afford  better take public transport,btohqsg
Only thing that's over is the deposit,btohqsg
I saw 2 solutions in this  1. They offered to do up the damage then take the car   2. They offered to get a second opinion from STA inspection to confirm your claims  if u are confident u will win that or have the damage done up why not just take it,btohqsg
After its a 16 year old japanese car,btohqsg
And the damage isnt detrimental  its fixable,btohqsg
change mind try to weasel back his  2000 dollars only,btohqsg
not even close to being scam,btohqsg
Sometimes it’s just down to understanding T&Cs  inclusions/exclusionsclearlybefore signing anything. Do the necessary homework and ask all the questions / concerns one needs upfront before signing. if we can do that for our employers  all the more so we should do when it comes to spending own hard earned money?,btohqsg
Not siding anyone here of coz,btohqsg
Think already quite nice to let him take to his own workshop for PPI …,btohqsg
when he first put out his statement he straight away say he got scammed.. this kind of thing can be quite damaging to businesses,btohqsg
Not like I own anything but I sometimes wonder  why do people have to place deposit for a PPI if it’s totally on the buyer’s cost?,btohqsg
because in this case one of the sales guys drove the car to the buyer's place for him to test drive  drove it to the workshop for PPI  those are costs that the dealership have to bear,btohqsg
if PPI before even placing deposit dealership no need to do business liao,btohqsg
Put it on the buyer lor. Then they buy witht their eyes open. If not car is back to market lor.,btohqsg
PPI for used car is just to ensure no major problem  not to ensure if the dealer is not being honest...,btohqsg
"which dealer will go and put ""has a few leaks"" in the ad",btohqsg
To confirm seriousness of purchase intent  put PPI costs on the buyer. It’s reasonable and it’ll weed out a lot of talkers already.,btohqsg
then it should be a reasonable request to PPI at a nearby location to dealer,btohqsg
To be fair I hardly see warranty on coolant leak so 👍🏼,btohqsg
but everything is down to agreement between seller and buyer  you willingly enter into agreement  then as long as the terms not being violated you either take the car or fofeit deposit and LLST,btohqsg
already give 2k discount out of a 42k car  and offer to repair flywheel leak which is a big deal,btohqsg
It’s like saying oh… this car has a leak.. MUST BE A BMW,btohqsg
10k depre where to find these days,btohqsg
https://www.sgcarmart.com/directory/popups/sta_popup.phpTHANK YOU SGCM FOR GIVING US SUCH GREAT RESOURCES!,btohqsg
At first when he say got leaks  i thought he buying BMW,btohqsg
To be fair  there are often buyers who are time wasters too..,btohqsg
Lol quite many would fail and customers walk away,btohqsg
Actually if dealer really fix all defects then put on sale sure loss due to the car age and mileage,btohqsg
Worse  put fixed and customers would think its an accident car,btohqsg
Old cars definitely got issues onr,btohqsg
It’s just how to previous owner deal with it,btohqsg
Cannot la....got risk of bak kup,btohqsg
Like someone people their golf need overhaul then instead of fixing it  they gonna sell it instead,btohqsg

Hi all  I stopped at this spot (marked in red) after the bus priority box in yellow during a red light. But a Cisco warden standing beside took a photo of me. Went back after parking but he was gone. Am I in the wrong?,btohqsg
As far as I know  if the bus alr hit yellow signal but u never stop,btohqsg
No bus was in bus lane,btohqsg
Was the bus preparing to come out?,btohqsg
Eh nvm U show us ur dashcam,btohqsg
Just that it was a red light. Then I stopped at that spot. No bus was in the bus bay before or after,btohqsg
Crossed over the yellow box as indicated,btohqsg
as long as bus coming out you must give way,btohqsg
Ya correct but there was no bus inside or coming out,btohqsg
That’s why funny the warden took my pic,btohqsg
then the cisco warden dunno doing what lo,btohqsg
Haha nvr mind wait for letter to come then fight,btohqsg
Does that mean the entire front section is mean for bus priority lane?,btohqsg
if got no buses there the box doesn't mean anything,btohqsg
Not only the yellow coloured portion,btohqsg
yellow boxes often will have space in front  always will have one car squeeze inside,btohqsg
Even no bus also cannot stop inside the yellow priority box,btohqsg
I am that one car today loh,btohqsg
but the gap should be safe ah,btohqsg
if is not supposed to have any vehicle there then they should just paint the whole way,btohqsg

Can we get PHV license just for the fuel discounts but don’t drive or paste the PHV decal?,btohqsg
To sign up for the disc  u need to submit log card tht states z10 n ur phv license,btohqsg
If u want the disc  open a lalamove acct. Deposit $70. Then u can use the disc as a lalamove driver,btohqsg
Is the job rates there still good,btohqsg
Will this affect your insurance if you declare nv use for such purposes,btohqsg
Then u see ur cc what disc lor,btohqsg
But which one is better for PHV?,btohqsg
U still earn ur usual card rebates,btohqsg
But their petrol price higher than others,btohqsg
Can.. it’s 2 different thing..1) one is a licence to work as a private hire driver. Which comes with the discount as a benefit.2) phv sticker is licence to drive people to their destination and earn money with that particular vehicle,btohqsg
Yes they may choose not to cover you or even cancel your coverage,btohqsg
U need a blue label on ur car to be entitled,btohqsg
You drive grab express still get fuel discount don't need PHV decal,btohqsg
U try applying to all petrol kiosk. They will ask u for license n log card,btohqsg
You can’t transfer the discount to other people but you can just show licence as proof,btohqsg
Cause if you rental can't show z10 also,btohqsg
The rule is car must have phv sticker,btohqsg
Cos u r on old car,btohqsg

Dont get caught at petrol stn,btohqsg

Just curious cause I notice rydepool and grabhitch don’t need phv license. If you do those but don’t have the z10 insurance can they choose not to cover also?,btohqsg
Yes your insurance can choose to not cover you,btohqsg
U try write in n ask. Holding phv license but not driving a phv registered vehicle  not doing phv. Entilted to phv disc?,btohqsg

Automotive   property  fuel & water  they can suck and suck,btohqsg
How they gonna do it sia  imagine I just get new car with Coe and shit. Then the following year the remove Coe and implement the new system. Like that how sia,btohqsg
Must see how much they charge lor   start engine then start charging Liao ?,btohqsg
Ltr 2cent per km.. one week 700km..,btohqsg
I think more likely $1 per km,btohqsg
Wa i will sell car le,btohqsg
cause if u take average 13k km per year clocked in SG and divide by 130k COE price  roughly same...but this is just a guess ah  don't find me if i guess wrong lol,btohqsg
Really not worth to drive anymore,btohqsg
maybe discounted rate for fleet/taxis thats all,btohqsg
Singapore government got no intention for people to buy car since the implementation of the coe .,btohqsg
If car was cheaper......maybe 3mil cars,btohqsg
What i feel is  COE shld be perm,btohqsg
then subsequent release of coe depends on how many dereg,btohqsg
Coe tag to ic for life. U sell car  ur coe gone. Then cooling period 2yrs before buy next car,btohqsg
Lol non drivers will also hoard coe,btohqsg
Gov allow people to over trade that why now so many people own cars,btohqsg
Just stick to the 30/70 or 40/60 .,btohqsg
U still pay 30/70 ot 40/60,btohqsg
Just tht the loan of the car increases to suit ur 30/70 or 40/60,btohqsg
If nt how u think 100% loan works,btohqsg
Submission to banks n finance coy is nvr 100%,btohqsg
Stil 30/70 or 40/60 at max tenure 7yrs,btohqsg
Just tht if u no money for 30% or 40%  then ur car gets inflated to 30 or 40% more lor,btohqsg
After all coe is forced by the buyer reach the high price,btohqsg
Coe low   every people is happy,btohqsg
U get ur car  i earn my money,btohqsg
My friend recently go to 1 PI to ask . The PI gave him 8.46 % interest,btohqsg
Banks nt stupid to not know a car gets inflated,btohqsg
A car selling 100k at all other dealers. But this dealer come to me for a same car selling 140k owner down 40k take 100k loan,btohqsg
As long as hit 40/60 or 30/70 on paper work,btohqsg
Unless gov set rule say HDBonce.buycannot sell lor,btohqsg
Want to sell can only sell at buying price,btohqsg
Gov can only introduce cooling measures,btohqsg
Tbf hdb their predecessors messed it up,btohqsg
Its an error which can’t be fixed without hurting current owners,btohqsg
Where got public housing on free market one? It should be kept affordable. I mean our local market model is different but yah,btohqsg
The moment u go free market  affordability cannot be used,btohqsg
Now hdb also not affordable  if no grant given,btohqsg
Its suppose to be cheap for ur 1st house,btohqsg
Cannot afford HDB  can afford cars,btohqsg
Exactly. We shudnt be needing grants in the first place,btohqsg
If u want more than what the gov initially provide  then u pay lor,btohqsg
Thts y got 2 BTO chances ma,btohqsg
1st hse buy 3rm. Got kids  down the road earning power more  then use 2nd chance get 4 or 5rm,btohqsg
So give grant Liao   they got the excuse saying the hdb they sell at cheap price,btohqsg
Very soon is cannot afford to live,btohqsg
Now food stuff   fuel all increase,btohqsg
Poor but every meal eat restaurants buy branded,btohqsg
Then kp gov nvr give handouts,btohqsg
I take the handout then go pay my debts sorry different category,btohqsg
i only getting i think idk,btohqsg
Actually use gov handout mod car best,btohqsg
Snowball to many million then buy,btohqsg
1mil  keep 500k.Then 500k divide 10yrs. Every year take out 50k to use.Then drive PHV. One day 50-100 for daily,btohqsg

VRS is a cheaper GTI for the family man,btohqsg
The 1.4 is plenty good enough for sg roads,btohqsg
They make good cars but singaporeans prefer more well known names,btohqsg
Conti cars r generous w turbo,btohqsg
Functions as a proper turbo as intended,btohqsg
I only had for a month. Mileage is good. Like 700km on a full tank and mild hybrid.,btohqsg
Yes  the boot is really spacious. But most space taken up by ICE already.,btohqsg
Can feel the turbo kick in when accelerating. Love all the nice accessories. In-door umbrella  Apple play  wireless charger  usb-c ports,btohqsg
1.4T is a given for Volkswagen cars leh,btohqsg
I traded my 1.4T Jetta for the Octavia,btohqsg
The 1.2t CHR is a rubbish of a car,btohqsg

Got 1 yr kanna $1 coe right,btohqsg
although considered high in the past  but nowadays it’s decent liao. Not always get to be $2.95,btohqsg
But those who kana the $1 also nvr get 20k rebate,btohqsg

This one normal  nowdays need atleast 2 income to sustain the cost. Unless that one person can earn that amount or if not drive grab lor,btohqsg
Thats why dealer bidding is the problem also,btohqsg
Those who still can buy new cars with today's coe prices are friggin rich,btohqsg
