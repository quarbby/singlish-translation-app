Hi  I watch Chris supercharge CPF.. just wondering why is it better to top up VCMA then RSTU first? If top up via RSTU then when SA reach FRS then do VCMA will it be the same result?,btohqsg
Your 8% go to OA already  no more 14% in SA,btohqsg
No supercharge effect when you do this way. The supercharge comes from  max MA,btohqsg

Is it true that we should amaze for foreign purchase only on weekdays? If yes  which day will it be?,btohqsg
Another benefit of VCMA is that if you do VCMA and eventually you hit BHS  the contributions overflowing to your SA to hit FRS will not be reserved for your retirement account (RA) when you turn 55.Whereas for RSTU  any amount you top up as well as the interest will be reserved for your RA,btohqsg
I remember honey money says it‚Äôs cheaper  i.e. better exchange rate during weekdays?,btohqsg
via axs app only get 0.3% for max $50 payments using maybank family. Can via SP app instead  still have a few cards with rebate e.g. uob one; ocbc 365 or posb everyday for recurring payment,btohqsg
other cards also have worse rates during weekends  so still better to use Amaze if using linked cards with good benefits,btohqsg

When u guys apply for the EGA account  does it auto apply for the investment account or we have to apply that separately?Also anyone EGA applications is taking a very long time to get approval?

Just open equity and buy any stocks normally people here buy 1 ES3 or A35The broker fee + Gst is like $11,btohqsg
Ok thanks guys  will proceed with the open of investment account üëçüòä,btohqsg
Yes thanks. Went to research about this but can‚Äôt find on CPF website.. I done RSTU for the past three years sadly.. maybe next year start VCMA instead.,btohqsg
For RSTU... The top up and it's accrued interest gets earmarked for RA... But how about OA tsf to SA?,btohqsg
OA transfer to SA won't be reserved.Please note that it's not accrued interest  it is interest earned.Accrued means owing. Which in CPF would only mean OA/SA used for housing/education. SA may be permitted to use for housing but it was once during the financial crisis (forgot which one liao).,btohqsg
