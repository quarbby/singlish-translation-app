I had the sinus thing if itâ€™s just watery eyes and running nose issue last time as well for like many years and in the end decided to seek medical help and I regretted it though,btohqsg
The doctor gave me nasal spray and it works wonder! BUT,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ ya sia like ramly burger,btohqsg
lol after that I had hives and rashes issues instead and it kept on changing,btohqsg
The nasal spray gave you hives and rashes??,btohqsg
No. Not durian noodles. The way they describe the products. No need bowl  utensils and even cooking.Perfect when I just wish to be expending zero calorie.,btohqsg
I went back to the doc and they said cause it suppressed my histamine thingy so end up it found other ways to breakout lol,btohqsg
Then how did you deal with it in the end?,btohqsg
You allergic to the spray. Change the med.,btohqsg
so best is to seek specialist  normal doctors might not be able to help,btohqsg
I don't understand. All the more she should charge?,btohqsg
doc say itâ€™s not allergy  itâ€™s more of immune issue liao,btohqsg
Frd ask u for help. Why u want to charge?,btohqsg

Some of these spray has steroids which does affect the immune. But I am not sure of your case,btohqsg

If has clean outdoor air  best is open windows to let fresh air in.Daily vacuum and mopping of floors help a ton too. The floor is the largest air purifier in your house.Strategically position your air purifier in center of room for maximum efficiency.In descending order.,btohqsg
If not i always have to bring 4 pkts of tissues,btohqsg
Change your name to èµ– Hae Bee,btohqsg
