So far i have been doing exact same steps on both humans  the difference is1. humanA acct is opened in May  humanB opened in June2. Funds is zero on one and max on other alternate months.What is implication?,btohqsg
Should be ok. Since when human A register again in June it’s invalid.,btohqsg
So.. to be correct  actually the sms for each human just need to be sent in alternate months. No need to send every month. Right?,btohqsg
I see.. phew.. thank you so much!!@mttelegrammt,btohqsg
This is the game play as HSBC EGA tnc is for 2 months now.It used to be for 3 months and it was a different play style then.,btohqsg
I feel so disappointed in myself  been 3months  yet i am still confused 😵‍💫😵‍💫,btohqsg
Seems u get it already. Have confidence!,btohqsg
Btw.. the 1% cashbacks only starts after the 2k in and 5x out transactions is done  or it doesnt matter? If it does  then shdnt we do it immediately now,btohqsg
As long as done same month it’s fine,btohqsg
U will notice once done it lasts 2 months.,btohqsg
I notice cashback on giro payment comes in like 2-3 days after it posted.But lets say my humanB starts the new cycle this month  and has not done any transfer nor sms  and a giro payment kicks in  wont it not earn the cashback?Or will they realise after u send in the sms  and then look back to find what they havent cashbacked u. 😵‍💫,btohqsg
If just started. Do as early as possible.Once engine starts running it’s fine to do anytime within the month because the first round will last 2 months and each subsequent round also lasts 2 months.,btohqsg
Ya true.. i tink just do it now. (I was wondering to do it before sms or after sms? But dang it! I will do both! 😅 ),btohqsg
You are right. Just realise the event only count on 9am monday onwards  i will do sms and transfer that time..Haha thank you! (*goes hiding in shame😭*),btohqsg

Thanks for sharing here. Did u happen to apply for any UOB cards or respond to any Lazada promotion recently? I asked to explore whether the so called mysterious card is part of the 'package' haha,btohqsg
30/29×500=517.25 since transaction today will be dated 2 Sep,btohqsg
CSO called back to say $517.37   not 500,btohqsg
Oops I just did the 2K and 5 transfers out today. Nvm I will do again tomorrow. Kiasu haha,btohqsg
I did apply for the uob one card on 1 aug but I checked the automated email and it shows that is the only card that I applied and the CS says that the Lazada card was jus approved on the 28 Aug 🫤,btohqsg
New Sep hsbc ega promotion at 3.30% +1%. Funds 1 need fresh funds not transferred from another hsbc bank account 2 funds cannot be withdrawn and redeposit within 30 days,btohqsg
may i know how to check ADB in HSBC?,btohqsg
Hi! Can I confirm that hsbc rev  Dbs women world and uob lady’s card bonus points is capped by calendar month and not statement date?,btohqsg
dbs woman world calendar month  transaction dateuob lady calendar month  posted date,btohqsg
maybe ur end balance in Aug is a few cents lower than the average daily balance in Augrevised formula as 30/29×(500+end balance in Aug-average daily balance in Aug) since transaction today will be dated 2 Sep,btohqsg
Oh my! I have been spending based on statement date instead of calendar month. It’s so tricky to track when cal month and statement date aren’t align,btohqsg
Why not make the statement date to either start or end of the month? Easier to track.,btohqsg
What about revolution card? Statement or calander month ?,btohqsg
use chat with them to ask and wait for 3 working days to reply,btohqsg
Hi what is a efficient platform to purchase etc and do rsp? Any guidance that I can read up?Apologies if this is not the channel to ask this.,btohqsg
Presumably if you have participated in a Lazada promo or compaign  u would be put through UOB cards application workflow which trigger Singpass MyInfo or data entry.I suggest u consider changing your UOB ibanking credential and Singpass Mobile app PIN if you have not done so recently. This would mitigate in the event if your account is compromised.,btohqsg
No difference if we top up today or tmr right?,btohqsg
does anyone know if buying the $128 adult concession will be considered a simplygo transaction & earn SCB smart card bonus points?,btohqsg
If I use axs (hsbc ega debit card) to pay my UOB credit card bills  can i still get 1% cashback?I got the cashback in Jun  but July I didn’t get it.,btohqsg
I cannot sign in SCB too.,btohqsg
Then may i know how to justify to hdb to go for this scheme.,btohqsg
If I want to ding dong between 2 HSBC EGA accounts every month  can I just withdraw the funds from Person 1 on the 1st of every month  transfer to another bank and then to Person 2 on the same day? How does this 30 days clause affect the ding dong strategy?,btohqsg

Hello gurus  wish to ask for uob lady card's travel category includes payment of hotels overseas?,btohqsg
Hi  I tried Choc Finance for last 7 days in Aug. Supposed to be $2.30 × 7=$16.10. However  on the last day of Aug  there was a subtraction fr my acc. Leaving me with only $13+ in total interest.Furthermore   I find the amount of interest very little considering I actually topped up beyond $20k.Don't understand how it's being calculated.Anyone else has tried Chocolate Finance?,btohqsg

Hi gurus  any ways to check whether you have been qualified in the EGA Aug bonus interest promo? Do HSBC sent you any confirmation msg?,btohqsg
Why top-up above 20k tho? There's a fee if they outperform the targeted return (currently 3.5% p.a.).,btohqsg
