Yes cause our speed limit is just too low,btohqsg
"For the mild hybrids a bit different  the mild hybrid implementation is still conceptual and is set to debut in Europe. The pure ICE one is for South Asia and African markets where consumers prefer manual gearboxes for ""efficiency gains"" or familiarity",btohqsg
Even for a low speed limit these jokers can do 70+ barely 80 on a 90kmph expressway,btohqsg
But hor why tail fare just wait for opportunities to overtake will do,btohqsg
Later I show u a video a joker doing 70 at kpe I need filter to 3 rd lane to over take,btohqsg
70 at kpe ok la..I close one eye and let him have it. My record I saw was 60 on MCE lane 1,btohqsg
70 is not ok at all lol,btohqsg
Ok I ask you one question. Say we increase speed limit to 110  the speed limit increases for all 3 lanes yes? So lane 2 drivers also speed up and drive at 100-110 instead of 80-90  yes? So people in lane 1 can still continue to hog at the same speed of 100-100. How will the increase in speed limit solve the issue of road hoggers?(btw I am not against increase of speed limit  all for it),btohqsg
Actually no  the hoggers will continue to hog at 80+ because as quoted they don't feel safe going over 90,btohqsg
Ya I understand your point but I believe that a lot of lane 1 driver at 90 will move to lane 2,btohqsg
As hogger a lot of themThinking is to drive safe so they might not even hit 110,btohqsg
70 is the limit in some sections of kpe  but I do agree  should move out of lane 1 to cruise at 70 or let faster cars pass by,btohqsg
Singaporean are used to driving slow... anything over 100 is dangerous ...,btohqsg
Hoggers mostly drive at government defined speed limit as they think that is the safe speed  the will likely go upto 100/110 still  blindly follow one,btohqsg
That is only a smal stretch and u can drive at 80   the Camara also wonâ€™t go off   and 70 all the way is just ridiculous,btohqsg
If step gearbox can be simulated by CVT  it's easy for EV to do the same,btohqsg
"Unpopular opinion from a lady driver which I shall not name. ""When I enter the expressway I go to lane 1 because then only need to watch for traffic on the left"" - her logic is amazing.",btohqsg
just like u ask Ur mlysian fren come sg drive . they will fall asleep,btohqsg
Yes but sure got a portion will move back to lane 2 as they felt comfortable there,btohqsg
Actually a lot of lady driver are better as they will stay at lane 1,btohqsg
I then told her  left most lane also you only need to watch for traffic on the right,btohqsg
Ya now the main hoggers are the commercial vehicles driven by foreigners,btohqsg
Possible  but I feel the issue of hogging will remain even if speed limit is increased. What needs to change is driver mentality and clarification of road rules that lane 1 is overtaking lane  it is not ok to use it and just go at 90 blocking traffic behind.,btohqsg
Yes but increasing speed limit will improve the situation for sure,btohqsg
Sometimes the commercial vehicles understandable because lane 3 is filtering into an exit so they must stay in lane 2 or else they will be forced to take the exit because sadly many road users don't give them way,btohqsg
Now is like ppl driving same speed as Lorry,btohqsg
Now hard to go above speed limit at times on ECP anyway  apart from 11am to 4pm slot or later at night. So much traffic  average speed range becomes 30 to 60 alr,btohqsg
Oh lane 2 I close one eye... They are on lane 1. Those small vans  sometimes box lorries even,btohqsg
Yes cause they think the cars are slower then them HAah,btohqsg
Lane 1 cars really annoying  unless you have some hiace flying down also  in which case it's fine but need to maintain distance in case they slam their brakes,btohqsg
I think because of recent oil price... all driving slower .. so jam at highway these daya,btohqsg
And a lot of sinkie like to block you or accelerate when u change lane,btohqsg
Actually  offices have opened up and tourists making their way back  traffic in general has increased quite a bit,btohqsg
These people not very smart  ICE cars have a gearbox and higher gears are more efficient. Not all the time slow saves fuel,btohqsg
not really . u drive 80 n 100 got difference...,btohqsg
Depends if 80 on gear 5 Vs 100 on gear 7,btohqsg
at 80 will be on highest gear on most auto cars,btohqsg
60 already highest gear in alot of cars,btohqsg
Really depends on gearbox setup of the car,btohqsg
And how the TCU learns your driving patterns,btohqsg
Lol don't think the hoggers really think so much before doing so. To them  slow is safer or they just feel unconfident to go faster but somehow don't want to move because they have the mentality of the car behind can go faster means is speeding,btohqsg
like my boss... he drive only max 80 plus in his honda jazz.  can fall asleep in his car..... but at 80 honda jazz sound proof really cmiðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
My prev boss also goes around there but avoids lane 1 ðŸ˜„ because don't want to block others,btohqsg
I dont like my mild hybrid. Wish it can turn off.But the coasting is good thou. I can coast and even overtake people when its downslope. Rpm Is 0  no engine brake kicks in and the drag is low also  hence lesser resistance,btohqsg
Itâ€™s Mr@arnavgulianisir. He is very good. Like Google lens.,btohqsg
Yes this is a decent human being lol,btohqsg
Yeah the bmw in me canâ€™t tell. Hats off to him. He knows well,btohqsg
Not gender related â€¦ an idiot is an idiot,btohqsg
He and Mr Xun combined â€¦ walking knowledge base,btohqsg
But so far I see road hogger is like 99% males lol,btohqsg
