Most shopping mall shops now all accepts amex,btohqsg
Samsung pay just deleted off my Grab card as payment.... haiz,btohqsg
Not sure if any special action needs to be done  it was just there in the citi app and ibanking page,btohqsg
Use their grab payment damn troublesome. Too many clicks to enter...,btohqsg
check for cancellation fees if less than 6 mths. check if will affect credit score,btohqsg
But I feel like boycotting grab card now  since they withdraw our final straw ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
They're not dumb lah. The retention officer used Grab top ups as a way to try and retain me when I cancelled my card. They know we're using the card for grabpay top ups. Tbh as long as Grab is paying Amex  I don't think Amex care.,btohqsg
Wow uob oneâ€™s criteriaâ€™s kinda confusing,btohqsg
citi app ah hmm need to pay some small fee but never say how much,btohqsg
Citi Pay All is something like Card Up.it allows u to pay for insurance  tax etc that would other wise not be eligible but it charges u i think 2%.so just like card up  if your base credit card doesn't give u high enough a rebate  paying 2% to convert non-eligible to eligible spend is not worth it. Works with some citi cards only.https://www1.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/other-services/payall,btohqsg
2% kinda high vs 1.6 on the citi Casback plus,btohqsg
OMG this was fast oops this is the old mews,btohqsg

idk if the sign up 3% bonus now still can top up Grab or not. but i dont think so,btohqsg

Tcb. For simplygo Standard charted's smart credit card is good,btohqsg
i recall its no more for new user only the exisiting user enjoyt it,btohqsg
But they are aware of it and that's even more frightening.,btohqsg
Wahahah! Now we need to strategy instead of amex grab method,btohqsg
UOB One is giving 8.33% for simplyGo.10% if u hit their 2k/mth tier,btohqsg
AMEX to Grab is i think will still be here albeit reduced rebates.Using this method to pay my bills last time can buy me chai fan.Now can buy me Kopi O Kosong small cup at neighbourhood kopitiam,btohqsg
ya that why i swtich to uob one from SCB smart,btohqsg

UOB ONE card is still my preferred card since i'm for cashback n not miles,btohqsg
But the tier is damn complicated.,btohqsg
i got used to it. kinda of an expert using this card le lol,btohqsg
the app will show u meet  the req,btohqsg
yeah  i use buy now pay later to help spread out the quota over several months also,btohqsg

Maybe can get UOB Evol card? Req $600 spending? Less troublesome and less tracking?,btohqsg
i feel evol harder to meet,btohqsg

speclfic catagory to meetuob one more all rounder,btohqsg
At least not immediate effect... Lot of BS nerf recently is immediate effect,btohqsg
in addition  for wedding venue  i ask hotel split the cost into 12 months instalment n charge it to my card. All counted as eligible spend . Hotel happy  i happy,btohqsg
It will be legendary if Grabcard changes from masters card to AMEX,btohqsg
Evol got category cap   headache coz now need to figure out which spend fall into which category.uob one simpler  just meet quota.,btohqsg
agreed and 100$$ less just 500,btohqsg
AMEX wont approve.If i'm amex that is.,btohqsg
now im thinking citi pay need pay extra %% to useduno what else card to use to pay recurring insuance premiumsince amex only allow on AIA for 1st payment and subsiquent is not allow,btohqsg
Get ready for more nerfs again lolhttps://www.todayonline.com/singapore/grab-cut-travel-budget-freeze-most-hiring-and-salaries-senior-managers-ceo-calls-frugal-and-prudent-mindset-2072446,btohqsg
all over tech layoff like shopeee,btohqsg
Grab i feel is in a slippery slope. A death spiral.stock price dropping.Interest rates rising means they cant borrow as easilythey cut cost to reduce operational cost and reduced rewards to stop bleeding but this hurts their bottom line as they are effectively only relying on Grab Ecosystem Fans to sustain.,btohqsg
oh so qiao  just as i mention  u post this,btohqsg
killing the hen laying the egg,btohqsg
Grab better pray pray that amex don't nerf them. Or else this will be a final nail to the coffin.,btohqsg
that's why my grabpoints now i thinking how to offload it.need exit strategy from grab ecosystem.,btohqsg
this is not the final nail on the coffin.the final one is when they....Nerf grab points conversion.now 500 pts = $1if they nerf like 1000 pts = $1 then that's really the end,btohqsg
Taking into consideration the progression of Uber when it was still here I'd say Grab has managed to outlive that. With a lot more users reliant on the platform that has expanded into things more than ride hailing it also means that their fall would be even greater,btohqsg
Use for flashdeal or direct offset from purchase,btohqsg
