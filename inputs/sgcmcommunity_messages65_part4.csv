tesla can do loan all the while  u just have to approach bank yourself,btohqsg
they dont bother if you take loan or not  best is dont take loan  as they got lesser paper work,btohqsg
and when u approach bank for loan yourself  you will understand that bank can give u even 1 year loan lol,btohqsg
other dealer die die wan u take loan if not more exp,btohqsg
yes cause they want to earn loan kick back,btohqsg
but the buying experience is good  just go online click click all done  but retain your car plate is troublesome  u need to summit the paperwork yourself  and had to go make the number plate yourself,btohqsg
good mah. do it once and one finds out its actually not that difficult.,btohqsg
ya i was so dumb to call the bank and fight for 3 years loan  as it is not easy for dealer to give 3 years loan  then the loan officer just tell me that  u want 1 year we also can lol,btohqsg
everyone should go talk to bank to understand loans too. it's amazing what one can learn from that.,btohqsg
a whole new world of experience unlock,btohqsg
well.. the more we know  the more we understand what goes on in dealer minds - both good and bad.,btohqsg

i see ppl selling direct get better price,btohqsg
basically dealer use for now is just about loan,btohqsg

Oh. Not everyone like me keep trying to score brownie points (and more chance at monthly draw) ah üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Is it easier to buy from direct seller? As in no need to put deposit in order to send car for inspection?,btohqsg
Honestly I think easier to buy from agent,btohqsg
This is always something to negotiate sir. Sellers hate time wasters and tbh there are a lot out there. So often they put this requirement in an attempt to weed some out.,btohqsg
Some like it for comfort. Like feel more professional only.,btohqsg
If you know what you‚Äôre doing  you can buy from direct seller lor  my 2 cents,btohqsg
Hopefully can save the dealer comm,btohqsg
direct selling open a whole new world  no harm to try it out,btohqsg
so far ppl i know really get good deal from direct,btohqsg
I buy for you this can?,btohqsg
I think people want to avoid the ma fan ness of getting insurance and loan,btohqsg
that why  it depent on how much u want to save from it. example u buy a car that is 5 years old  and u full cash it  u save alot!,btohqsg
insurance and bank loan is very easy to get by direct also,btohqsg
i get mine from bank in a day,btohqsg
The flip side is I'd bear the full depreciation?,btohqsg
