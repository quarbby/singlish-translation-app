My internship in UK also could be cancelled,btohqsg
That's a ploy to keep ppl indoors la I believe,btohqsg
Herd immunity will require 400k deaths,btohqsg
SG need gpa to find job,btohqsg
Got ppl chiong for 1st ma,btohqsg
First is some sort of requirements for some type of job,btohqsg
Impossible for SG school cancel exam de,btohqsg
The administration won't want to do that,btohqsg
Cam even in ww2 also never cancel exam,btohqsg
I never expected them to cancel this time,btohqsg
SG is apply uni using real grade,btohqsg
The mid year Singapore exams all marked by SG,btohqsg
So like not like they gonna cancel,btohqsg
They still can mark within the country what,btohqsg
The year end one is the one we have to see,btohqsg
Like for Ns Os and As,btohqsg
Can be like Cambridge stay at home mark,btohqsg
Haha but all the Cambridge markers mark at home,btohqsg
U do know they mark online,btohqsg
If u forgot they completely change to online now,btohqsg
So no need to deliver to people alr,btohqsg
Now arts is in a booklet,btohqsg
Never do alev b4 I dunno,btohqsg
Like last year As was all answering booklets,btohqsg
Just listen to u guys talk only,btohqsg
Then Os 2 years ago is all answering booklet,btohqsg
I never sleep whole night also,btohqsg
Shn now my body clock cui,btohqsg
i remember cambridge still get a lvl scripts physically via air from sg,btohqsg
or else chem/math scripts wont get stolen,btohqsg
The chem scripts was before they went online bro,btohqsg
singapore is the only country that still does physical marking,btohqsg
if online no need air fly to UK le,btohqsg
Chem scripts was like 2017 A levels,btohqsg
Does bluer veins means lack of sleep,btohqsg
They convert to answering bookle alr,btohqsg
We couldn’t bring back our H2 math paper,btohqsg
In case I forget u amidst this mess,btohqsg
Coz it was blank space alr,btohqsg
The qn paper was the answering booklet,btohqsg
The math stolen one was retarded coz the person left his bag like an idiot,btohqsg
cos online scanning can truncate certain answers written near the edges,btohqsg
Well that’s why they have markings to show where to write,btohqsg
Like they will indicate where to not write,btohqsg
How are you guys typing fricking fast,btohqsg
U guys discuss so in depth stuff that have no bearing on u sia,btohqsg
Os 2018 was the pilot test,btohqsg
Maybe it was Os that was completely online,btohqsg
8843 ppl sat for H2 Chem,btohqsg
Good morning messages are for grandmas,btohqsg
Wait what is the new group title,btohqsg
Well most common science subject other than H2 math,btohqsg
waddafak happened to this chat i-,btohqsg
I like the old group title more,btohqsg
why would we randomly change group title nad logo like that,btohqsg
means out of 8843 ppl only about 3800 ppl got an A,btohqsg
I just realized the icon has Comic Sans,btohqsg
comic sans is a very readable font,btohqsg
we want to make sure that everyone can read the logo,btohqsg
We should have used an elitist font,btohqsg
but at least from this article,btohqsg
we can know why some ppl get early offers into local Us via EAE cos cambridge sends the results earliest end Jan,btohqsg
I 2019 As batch and apparently a lot of people couldn’t finish the H2 chem paper,btohqsg
i only agree p3 was tedious,btohqsg
p2 p1 and p4 is considered easy/doable,btohqsg
I think they referring to p3,btohqsg
Ok coz I like my subjects,btohqsg
then true ba  p3 was tedious,btohqsg
but not difficult to score 60/80 or higher,btohqsg
Bro I’m now studying but for NS,btohqsg
And I like my subjects in JC so yea,btohqsg
If it’s very technical one then yea,btohqsg
i still remember how i spent the last hour doing nothing,btohqsg
cos fk that shit im out,btohqsg
Oo  I heard signals also need study,btohqsg
i was mixing 3 different mixtures from 3 different conical flasks together,btohqsg
Pretty sure anything that is not physically demanding need to study,btohqsg
and the QA portion i heard pop sound i just write it down in my results table without doing any of the tests,btohqsg
the examiner was literally judging me,btohqsg
but cant do anything  cos SPA ma,btohqsg
it was  but full of tricks,btohqsg
I’m just gonna be glad I’m not recon,btohqsg
Why the chat group name so long de,btohqsg
we want to become more official bro...,btohqsg
I tot its republic of Singapore navy,btohqsg
as u can see this name is 100% more official and cool sounding,btohqsg
All 3 pracs have a graph to draw,btohqsg
i remember got 1 year  either 2018 or 2019 some HCI student throw the plasticine at the teacher during the national exam prac for physics,btohqsg
Scare me. Tot I was added to some chat group,btohqsg
The short pracs ah one of them set up for us lol,btohqsg
U put plasticine at 2 ends,btohqsg
u all got NUS offers alr?,btohqsg
Why when I type testicle it became restocked,btohqsg
2019 they give u plasticine attaches to spring which is attached to string,btohqsg
i think this yr a bit slow ah,btohqsg
Got yesterday after they ask me to update the criminal thing,btohqsg
I forgot to do that part lol,btohqsg
I did the criminal thing like weekend,btohqsg
nus gonna send out results today and be like sike april fools,btohqsg
Then they give me offer yesterday,btohqsg
i thought usually perfect scorers get it way earlier,btohqsg
doesnt seem to be the case this yr,btohqsg
It’s either they give me offer alr just need me to declare no criminal records or they gave me offer within like 3-4 days,btohqsg
nope my friend got in like,btohqsg
cos i rmb last yr NUS i got my offer only at 17th april,btohqsg
cos last yr i only got it at 17th april also,btohqsg
Actually depends on the courses u apply for,btohqsg
got some ppl supposedly offered alr,btohqsg
while my frens last yr was rejoicing,btohqsg
even though im doing it now... ooops,btohqsg
nus always play hard to get,btohqsg
other unis more desperate cos their revenues combined dont even match NUS,btohqsg
feels good to transfer out then,btohqsg
Wut did u even apply lol,btohqsg
Ntu just ask u click links to get ur letter lmao,btohqsg
Unless u somehow nvr declare u singaporean,btohqsg
need declare in the tick box first,btohqsg

ye tech nowadays is an integral part of our lives,btohqsg

My 2nd choice xd but I gonna go for math if I get it lol,btohqsg
Not gonna go for any science,btohqsg
Anyways I took only 1 science in As,btohqsg
IGP doesnt correlate to prestige anyways,btohqsg
So I dun think I qualify for many of the science courses,btohqsg
Haha my batch no open house what to feel,btohqsg
i had a friend with 60 rp entering NUS biz,btohqsg
But anyways if they had open house it would be my POP day,btohqsg

Blackpink is actually the greatest Kpop group in existence,btohqsg

To be fair it is a genetically engineered bio-weapon created by the remnants of the WW2 military development department of the communist China regime as a contingency plan to destroy the rest of humanity when they find themselves threatened,btohqsg
only reason the west is so fucked rn is cuz they didnt do preperation well unlike other countries,btohqsg

schools just serve as a vehicle to ur final destination,btohqsg
destination being ur career & life,btohqsg
and life leads you to death,btohqsg
and career leads you to money,btohqsg
which in the grand scheme of things,btohqsg
not everyone wants merely money out of a career,btohqsg
and leads u to death anyway,btohqsg
so what led to your uneventful demise?,btohqsg
"Tfw ""money cant buy happiness"" doesnt hold anymore",btohqsg
I'd rather cry in a Lamborghini than a Toyota,btohqsg
i'd convert all my karma into money anytime,btohqsg
if I knew I think you shld be worried that you're talking to me,btohqsg
provided you even have any karma to begin with,btohqsg
exchange rate would be worse than indonesia's one,btohqsg
one shitpost earns you thousands of karma,btohqsg
whatever a career leads to  the eventual end is death anyway,btohqsg
It's not the end that matters  it's the ride,btohqsg
imo nihilism leads to the destruction of human society,btohqsg
and i dont wanna be part of the cause for it,btohqsg

cant take care of the world unless u take care of yourself first,btohqsg
If u dont take proper care of urself,btohqsg
sounds as vague as trump saying healthcare is easy,btohqsg
let's be honest  it's not easy to take down Trump,btohqsg
He has been roasted every day on twitter,btohqsg
suicide will eventually lead to ur family suffering and those who rely on u to take care of them to r.i.p.,btohqsg
so its adding burden to society,btohqsg

But its all under 1 degree right?,btohqsg
is ti's like 4 h2 in jc,btohqsg

As for h3 physics i applied too latr,btohqsg
I could’ve taken only PCM H3,btohqsg
does anyone even take 4 h2s there,btohqsg
Needed the 4H2 AU if i took physics,btohqsg
I take pcme but diff class from them,btohqsg
