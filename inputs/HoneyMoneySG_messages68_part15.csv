hi new user for amaze here  let‚Äôs say if I link with my dbs livefresh card which has 5% cashback for transport/simplygo  so if I tap with amaze will it work? it will be the same with other cards with cashback too rite? üòÖ thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Seems like Amaze + CRMC is still good to use? Those categories with 1% charge are those you won't get points on CRMC so you won't use Amaze to begin with,btohqsg
Not all business but I suspect more to come later,btohqsg
Amaze has to be with Mastercard.,btohqsg
Hey guys for uob lady travel category can earn 6mpd if pay through travel agency like fcm travel?,btohqsg
Yea I think you are right! We probably only have a few months or even 1 year before they start nerfing linked credit card. They seem to be pushing heavily to use their wallet,btohqsg
Can I check for automotive services at Toyota  can I use amaze + crmc to get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Spend first don‚Äôt regret when it gets nerfed later.,btohqsg
(6 + 10)@kevinlpk97  please  send the solution to the arithmetic operation provided within the time amount specified to this group  otherwise you will be kicked. Thank you! (60 sec)Powered by1inch Network,btohqsg
Heathcare services? So healthhub will have the added fees?,btohqsg
Even for shopback? Or do you link Citi rewards directly to shopback account and not amaze,btohqsg
I don't use shopback üòÇ But I guess you can just connect CRMC to Shopback right? Since its online spend. Not sure though,btohqsg
Ah I didn't know shopback is considered online spend. Okay got it thanks!,btohqsg
Wait I am not sure if Shopback is considered online. You will need to double check.I would think it is online since XNAP is considered Online.,btohqsg
XNAP uses Apple/ Google Pay so it will become mobile wallet and not online,btohqsg
The system will only deduct if you are successful in your bid.,btohqsg
Travel agency is a tricky one. Nobody knows the actual mcc code. suggest to use DBS Digibot method to confirm the mcc code.Eg. CTC travel is 5965 instead of 4722.Good luck to you.,btohqsg
Hihi recently saw a TikTok video saying that you can actually just travel the minimum amount to UOB one account and act as an salary so that your funds can earn 5 percent . Anybody using this method ? Any issue with tax since when you xfer it will be under the salary catogory. Any other impact   mind sharing . Thanks,btohqsg
with this nerf  what card to use to pay doctor/dentist for miles? usually I use crmc+amaze,btohqsg
Uob ppv or vs as long as it's private clinic,btohqsg
Is UOB my lady card good since amaze is being nerfed..,btohqsg
If u didn't get tracked  just drop and email to shop back and explain. They very helpful to get it tracked for u if it is rightfully yours. Send screenshots as reference.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs affected  most likely you won‚Äôt use UOB Lady on those nerfed merchant categories,btohqsg
Uob lady Card is not dependent on amaze so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ,btohqsg
Okay guys! I am struggling with this whole UOB ONE credit card tracker.Anyhow has a UOB ONE Credit Card tracker like in Excel Sheet that you don't mind sharing  please?,btohqsg
if i use citi reward card direct go to shop buy iphone still can get X10point rewardÔºü  or must use the amaze card,btohqsg
must use amaze or buy at apple online,btohqsg
must at online ahÔºü if use physical amaze card at shop canÔºü,btohqsg
If go to offline shop need Amaze to convert to online to get 4mpd on crmc.,btohqsg
Is your iPhone cost more than $1000  if yes  then you only can get maximum 4000 miles. Citi rewards cap at max 4K miles per month.,btohqsg
New revolut and amaze user here. Heading to taiwan next week  which card will you all recommend?,btohqsg
Revolut no credit card points  Amaze gotRevolut rate should be better.Which one do you prefer?,btohqsg
Thank you for clearing my doubt. Maybe  for simple guy like me  will prefer revolut. Just for the fx rate,btohqsg
If just for fx rate  Amaze wallet is better,btohqsg
Amaze will now charge 1% to linked card transactions  effective 13th October.source:https://www.instarem.com/blog/terms-and-conditions/mcc-exclusions/#table-sgd,btohqsg
Hey  anyone knows if shopee/lazada falls under a certain category for uob lady card ? I made a transaction on lazada last month using a uob lady card  but doesnt seem to get any bonus points on it,btohqsg
shopee/lazada have different MCCs  no way to consistently get bonus points,btohqsg
does payment through Google Wallet count as an advertisement? ü§î,btohqsg
support all currencies  just topup in sgd and spend,btohqsg
Lazada i always use citi lazada  coz their mcc varies,btohqsg
Oh  great to know. Thank you so much,btohqsg
no lah  the fees is on transactions with the selected MCCs,btohqsg
Oh  meaning each seller may have differing MCCs ?,btohqsg
Hi does this means if i link CRMC to amaze to shopback pay (not paylater)  i will still get 4mpd? Or will it also work if i just link CRMC to shopback pay directly?,btohqsg
Thoughts on quit at 34 so can buy bto? Then work at 36. The gainz of bto outweighs the salary. Worst case its a 2 year sabbatical if didnt manage to bid. Edit: for singles who break the ceiling but not filthy rich to buy condo,btohqsg
1) Just to be sure  you know your next quarter is Oct/Nov/Dec or assuming?  And u know it is based on statement months not calendar months?2) If you met min $500 and min 5 transactions in each month of your quarter u get $50 quarterly rebate (up to 3.33%). And if you spent on selected merchants like giant u get additional 5% rebate. 5%+3.33%= 8.33%  u dun get 10%,btohqsg
Hi evrryone. This is regarding OCBC 360. Last month  on 1st  I put abt $600 in it. My pay was credited by GIRO abt 3k+ and on that day i withdraw all as i need for monthly expenses. End of month the average balance is $200+. I'm puzzled why this is so. What can i do to ensure average daily balance is at least $500 to earn the 1.2% saving bonus. Thanks a lot in advance,btohqsg
Bto so small... Josephine says it's alright...oh well,btohqsg
