Thanks for creating this useful tool üòÅ really like the UI.Just curious  how are you all monetising this?,btohqsg
Thanks for the question  we think this would be useful for SG. But we don't plan to monetize in SG  not on our horizon. This launch in SG helps us build the product for global market  especially US  where integration with banks are possible. Deep integration allows us to offer much more rich values for user to fully automate their personal finance journey.We plan to ensure our incentive is fully aligned with users  by not taking any money from the marketer side  or pass on the marketing income direclty to the users. We plan to charge a subscription for more advanced use cases in the future.,btohqsg
