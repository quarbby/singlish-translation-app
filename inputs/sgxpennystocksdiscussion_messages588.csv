Singtel Loses Landmark $640 Million Australian Tax Case1. Australia on Friday won a landmark court ruling against Singapore Telecommunications  a victory in the country’s battle against tax avoidance by multinational companies through cross-border financing arrangements.2. The Federal Court of Australia on Friday dismissed the company’s appeal of a tax assessment related to the acquisition financing of Singtel Optus in 2001.3. Transactions between two wholly owned SingTel units “differed from those which might be expected to operate between independent enterprises dealing wholly independently with one another ” Judge Mark Kranz Moshinsky wrote for the court.More here,btohqsg
Less people want to do business with sinkie liao,btohqsg
Cannot transfer out to skip tax,btohqsg
Because people transfer money here for tax heaven. If the host country block  then no point liao,btohqsg

https://www.cschl.com.sg/projects.phpWas driving along AMK  Bishan side and saw a real big ongoing project. The entire stretch at were at full piling capacity judging from the No of tractors  cranes and piling machines over there.Did some checking and I believe the project is Contract T312.Also  good to know that they secured a rather big ongoing order book.As we all know the pandemic have led to worker shortage. However  I believe this worker crunch situation will eventually be sorted out as the world gets more vaccinated and increase our herd immunity.I guess that is why CSC have been actively buying back all shares at $0.014.For those expecting a construction recovery and 2022  to be a construction boom due to catch up works  can consider load at $0.014 since it’s risk free here.Note: the key to making big money is from anticipation. Chasing have killed many in the marketDYODD,btohqsg
CSC  i confidently say  $0.014 is an easy collection for those who can hold.- Chart looks good (bull flagging)- MACD golden cross- Anticipate a construction recovery (take a look at PanUnited recent share buy backs too)- NAV : $0.033- Company Share buy backs $0.014Hence  quite no brainer  got money can collect $0.014 with the company.DYODD and hope 2022 will reap the rewards,btohqsg

💎Pika World On the Go💎🎙Bank on Banks?⏱Banks had a good run thus far for the year. Many friends have asked about our outlook for the sector. Typically  banks are scared of regulations  which restrict their ability to grow their business. Hence  their prospect is firmly tied to the happening in Capitol.💵The Positive Side🔦The Fed is expected to raise the interest rate three times in 2022. This is a plus for banks. It boosts their net income and also improves net-interest margins. In addition  the initial increase in interest rate tends to help banks by repricing their loans faster than the cost of deposit.With the recovery still undergoing into 2022  we should see the banks having a mid-digit revenue growth  and earnings growth can expect to be at least around 10%  according to some analysts.💳The Negative Side🔫Fee income is a pain point for banks. We may not see the exponential growth and heightened trading and deal-making environment to continue into 2022. Moreover  with the Fed expected to raise interest rates  debt underwriting may soften. This means less fee income for banks.While we believe the Biden administration to be still conducive for banks  the current administration may appear to be still slightly tougher on banks  especially in overdraft and card fees  which we have read about in the early part of the year. What is good for consumers isn't always that well for investors of banks stocks.🪜Our Outlook🩺Pika World continues to favour banks as they are positioned for a growing economy. Of course  we do not expect to see the excess of 30% return this year be replicated in 2022. Still  the glowing economy may do the banks just fine unless Omicron or other exogenous shocks derail the economic recovery path.It is 21 December  Tuesday  7.30 am in Singapore and 7.30 pm in New York. It is yet another volatile week  and we hope our friends are having a safe trading week ahead!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

Its embarrassing because they didn't expect him to win. Can imagine the kind of support and treatment LKY was receiving so far. Mainly genes and self motivation I reckon...
