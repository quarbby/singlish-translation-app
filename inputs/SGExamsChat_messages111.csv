Yea thats why dont be too obsessed over it,btohqsg
I think this one  u know the name?,btohqsg
Hmm no the white thing not the cheese,btohqsg
The cut off is the same,btohqsg
is computing good for bcme combi,btohqsg
Y u say he weird  she didnt even say he weird,btohqsg
U dont need phy background for computing,btohqsg
Hmmm i cannot rmb the name,btohqsg
bcme student here that transferred out of computing,btohqsg
Bcme student also can do cs,btohqsg
I wan to go computer sci :D,btohqsg
then what u want me show? tits ah,btohqsg
Rather study a degree that i can only complete in a uni and pick up comp sci on the side instead,btohqsg
But im restudying h2 maths in the midst of a busy schedule now,btohqsg
Ya i rmb i saw this last time hahahhaha,btohqsg
Just quickly look through can alrdy,btohqsg
@i_want_sushiiiiiiiiiii  your username is honestly a mood.I miss eating Japanese food :`(,btohqsg
Lmao i did some qns 2 days ago and im ded,btohqsg
Statistics 1 week or less cfm can master whole h2,btohqsg
I love differentiation I hate integration,btohqsg
The minute a lvl p2 math ended everythin vaporised,btohqsg
Business analytics teaches the different data mining software.Computer science shd be alot of programming...?Info security studies security.Info system - google itWhich aspect of computing r u keen in? In ur own words,btohqsg
Lol 😂 it will expire one day,btohqsg
Info sys is integration of tech with biz 🤣,btohqsg
To put it bluntly  easiest course in SoC,btohqsg
Oh yea... yesIn fact the most boring. If i would choose i rather go for computer science (most abstract/interesting) or if not  BUSINESS ANALYTICS IS THE IN THING NOW. Do consider. Useful for job purpose,btohqsg
But will it still be the in thing in 4 years,btohqsg
D E F I N I T E L Y,btohqsg
But its ok  i rather study science instead.,btohqsg
Anything computing related will have reasonable demand in the next decade i believe,btohqsg
I thought u want make money,btohqsg
Who says an nus science grad cant make money,btohqsg
I thought u want 13k a month,btohqsg
Meanwhile I am going to NTU physics lol,btohqsg
Nus prof need phd i think,btohqsg
Serious note  is possible if one goes into banking/finance or oil industry,btohqsg
I mean a common path for sci grads is further studies what,btohqsg
Is there a uni that hires a professor without PhD,btohqsg
He is an assoc prof now,btohqsg
But of course before that he was only a senior lecturer,btohqsg
Uh yalor good questionMaybe will? Cos this whole AI thing just started only. Or study computer science then?,btohqsg
If there is big data then yes lorh,btohqsg
Regardless  learning cs is a good  or rather  an impt life skill one can take up,btohqsg
At first  chem seemed interesting but i felt like organic chem will be even difficult in uni,btohqsg
Yes even engineering n construction is possible. Just a matter of HOW LONG lo,btohqsg
The reason why most ppl cmi in uni chem,btohqsg
Is they dont know how to identify nucleophiles,btohqsg
Thats one of the main problems,btohqsg
Okay maybe the molecules alot moreComplex,btohqsg
Is that why ppl cant draw mechanisms,btohqsg
I gotten from J1 A to J2 MYE E because of that,btohqsg
Those like u have nvr seen before,btohqsg
If dk how draw  gg liao,btohqsg
Feel like org chem is more suited for bio students,btohqsg
Is like saying physical chem is suited for phy students,btohqsg
Most fun part of chem for sure,btohqsg
Oh no  do more org chem and periodic table practices man,btohqsg
:/I got hard carried by organic in j2,btohqsg
Yes yes!! One of my nus data analytic friend got offered by microsoft. Another from nus computer science is working for google at san frans now,btohqsg
Speaking of chem  still kinda pissed transition metals is removed for A levels😂 like i get why they do it but still,btohqsg
But tbh chem is actually a super impt subject,btohqsg
Yes la cos it will continue to be relevant,btohqsg
Rly tests u ur understanding of not just chem  but other subjects integrated into chem too,btohqsg
Dont need memorise colours anymore 🤣,btohqsg
Bobian lor  at most their A levels a bit harder to score free marks :),btohqsg
Guys I got a graph traversal problem need help,btohqsg
Hmm it’s a tiny fraction of what they gonna learn in uni.. with MO theory,btohqsg
Huh. I tot organic chem was easier than the whole inorganic chem,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA thats the only thing i know,btohqsg
Tbh   nuclear physics is easier than quantum physics,btohqsg
Idk eh  my current students say organic hard,btohqsg
Hahaha our chem expert is here students! Anything look for him,btohqsg
All the best hope u buck up,btohqsg
No need teach me everything just tell me the solution name I go Google,btohqsg
Go read minimum spanning tree and single source shortest path,btohqsg
Er... I already finished A levels haha  gotten a B  now in NS,btohqsg
I didnt see nuclear but quantum is quite fun,btohqsg
I tot math is for physics😶,btohqsg
Thou i cant math at all,btohqsg
And for H2 computing and H2 Further maths,btohqsg
I only know Ms Loh Xin Min,btohqsg
Idk her full name so Ms Loh*,btohqsg
Meanwhile im quite curious how much other private tutors earn here ngl,btohqsg
Ya but more or less got fixed range,btohqsg
Mr Lim Wei Jie  with glasses one,btohqsg
Bro what is the different between the 2,btohqsg
Wah all i never hear before one,btohqsg
Single source shortest path is to find the shortest path between a single vertex and ALL the other vertices such that sum of weight of the edges is minimised.Minimum spanning tree is a subset of the edges that connect ALL the vertex such that minimum total possible edge weight,btohqsg
Physics teacher Mr Ong Chee wah,btohqsg
My physics tutor is the subject head rn,btohqsg
Then the problem I have is use which one har,btohqsg
And my class can’t understand her,btohqsg
In ur problem i think it looks like minimum spanning tree  you want to go through all the places(vertex) with minimum weight,btohqsg
There are other traversal methods like BFS AND DFS,btohqsg
Who is the head of physics?,btohqsg
shortest path is only from one source to another vertex,btohqsg
I used to rmb the head as Mr Goh,btohqsg
In ur case is more like u want to go through all the vertices,btohqsg
As in single source shortest path,btohqsg
Unlikely you all will have the same teachers since you are successive batches,btohqsg
Single source shortest path is v specific. Like 1 source to 1 vertex at a time.Eg A to B takes 5A to C takes 10A to D takes ..... like that 1 by 1,btohqsg
Ur source vertex is A here,btohqsg
Oh not from a to b to c to d  liddat har,btohqsg
I no need start from A again,btohqsg
I want start from A and span everywhere,btohqsg
Minimum spanning tree is like u start from A,btohqsg
Using minimum total possible edge weight,btohqsg
You go read up prim algorithm,btohqsg
These are the 2 to find minimum soanning tree,btohqsg
But my edge is unidirectional sia,btohqsg
Minimum spanning tree is for connected undirected weighted edge graph,btohqsg
Once u visit a vertex  u box it up,btohqsg
Eh but I can visit the vertex multiple times sia,btohqsg
Choose the minimum possible weighted edge each time,btohqsg
No requirement to stop only once per vertex,btohqsg
Cos no direct path for certain pairs of vertex,btohqsg
You see whats the smallest edge,btohqsg
From A to any vertex not boxed up yet,btohqsg
If for eg A to C has the smallest edge,btohqsg
So A and C are now visited,btohqsg
Repeat this until all vertex visited,btohqsg
Then there's no direct edge between c and b,btohqsg
I want go b from c,btohqsg
Ur problem just wants u to visit all vertex right,btohqsg
As long as it passes the vertex once is ok?,btohqsg
As long as ur graph is connected  minimum spanning tree will work,btohqsg
Fuck 18 vertex my friend want to draw it out,btohqsg
If not connected ur problem is meaningless lol,btohqsg
Cause it is impossible to visit all if unconnected,btohqsg
you can get from ANY vertex to ANY OTHER vertex via a series of edges,btohqsg
I think confirm is connected if. Not can't even do,btohqsg
Hand draw can find solutions bo,btohqsg
True  just as an admin i would like to caution against giving away personal info to new members,btohqsg
Diff and integration are kinda fun ngl 😳 when i revise them and have the rules on hand ateast,btohqsg
Well tbh H1 econs tests on 3 macro aims instead of 4.,btohqsg
Ok I give up le. MST finds the edges only,btohqsg
Never count how many times I need to pass through the edges,btohqsg
My brain kenot comprehend this shit,btohqsg
I remember alr. It tastes like abolone!!,btohqsg
the rain seem to have stopped@medbag,btohqsg
It felt so good when its raining,btohqsg
what is peace when you've exams in 10 days,btohqsg
For some reason it made everything felt..,btohqsg
Everybody knows it sucks to grow up,btohqsg
I shall evolve into a fetus,btohqsg
The years go on and we're still fighting :),btohqsg
Being asian with parents that have high expectations of you,btohqsg
Atleast im almost done being a student.,btohqsg
luckily my parents aren't typical asians,btohqsg
they don't really have any expectations,btohqsg
For a moment I actually thought it was afternoon,btohqsg
Oops we just got surpassed by tsinghua,btohqsg
the sky towards ECP lookin blue as always,btohqsg
da ba de da ba da,btohqsg
yea I can't get the sounds right,btohqsg
Hi can i rant something here,btohqsg
Well  I guess sex can become BDSM now 😂,btohqsg
im blu da bu dee da bu da dada bu dee da bu da,btohqsg
Why when I online so quiet......,btohqsg
If I could be in one...,btohqsg
Where you learn to be Noble,btohqsg
Imagine Singaporean going university of malaya,btohqsg
We are alrdy below tsinghua and peking last year what,btohqsg
Har I tot is this year just happened,btohqsg
Sia la we lose so fast wor,btohqsg
It's a matter of time ba,btohqsg
China unis has the gov support sia,btohqsg
Tsinghua CS  ranking surpassed MIT a long time ago le,btohqsg
Lazy find exact ranking but you can see see if you want la,btohqsg
Next time python code in Mandarin😂,btohqsg
Tbh even if Tsinghua is high in the list would people go,btohqsg
It's not like Germany universities where even though you need learn German  it's free,btohqsg
Tsinghua you need learn the language plus pay,btohqsg
China will be a superpower in the future,btohqsg
Wont be surprised if in the future china unis are more prestigious than local unis,btohqsg
But in the future  it will,btohqsg
Were universities in the Soviet Union considered prestigious,btohqsg
Not trying to be snarky but legit wondering,btohqsg
Value of speaking chinese outweighs russian in the working world,btohqsg
Russian unis were prestigious in the past iirc,btohqsg
China unis will def be upz in the future,btohqsg
I rmb my sch had some alumni  go fudan study law  then graduation instantly $20k usd/month working in US as a bilingual laywer,btohqsg
Fudan is a Chinese uni right,btohqsg
20k in his first job? Wow  impressive,btohqsg
Isn't studying law usually more relevant to local context,btohqsg
So studying law in a Chinese University means you'll study more on Chinese law right,btohqsg
It's standard pay in US law firms,btohqsg
The value of a chinese degree is alluring to others cos he can also speak chinese,btohqsg
Hence he got hired to work in US lor,btohqsg
Fudan has agreement with Columbia law school for exchange,btohqsg
If u can secure offer in US equivalent of magic circle,btohqsg
But then again. Law school in US is a exclusively grad school thing,btohqsg
Your friend is prob an undergraduate,btohqsg
He earn 200k a year but has 0 college debt that US law school students have,btohqsg
Law school debt can reach up to 300k de,btohqsg
Probably not 0 debt la but a lot less than the people in US,btohqsg
maybe try asking ur prob and see if anyone knows?,btohqsg
i sq box them for u,btohqsg
Just want ask how is ite life,btohqsg
if u feel uncomfortable here  feel free to PM me bro,btohqsg
hmm  which college u gg to,btohqsg
But i scared go ite lol,btohqsg
getting job based on ur course and interview skills ba,btohqsg
ur school doesnt help much imo,btohqsg
when ppl tell u go blabla school got better chance at blabla job its almost always bs,btohqsg
I think its still a school in the end no?,btohqsg
What matters is you  not really the school,btohqsg
doesnt apply to banking and consulting,btohqsg
other than that its really about ur skills,btohqsg
I used to think its bttr to be in a gd rep sch,btohqsg
So travelled frm north east to clem,btohqsg
Gd rep doesn’t necessarily means good outcome,btohqsg
i go from tanah maerah to dover everyday,btohqsg
Once u get used to it,btohqsg
Same for my sp frens haha,btohqsg
ok de i read on the train also,btohqsg
Go sit ah punggol campus opening in 2023,btohqsg
I stuck in camp 8hrs a day,btohqsg
last time in camp i admin job study 15 hours a day,btohqsg
last time i study for some entrance test,btohqsg
My sis: RP is not a business school  seems more like a science school.,btohqsg
I agree that RP is more of sci cuz they offer a course that no other sch offer,btohqsg
might need consider what u wanna do after poly,btohqsg
if u wanna go uni then ur course choice matters,btohqsg
if u wanna work. then not so much,btohqsg
nobody expects poly grad to know anything,btohqsg
Some dont care what course u came from,btohqsg
nobody expects uni grad to know shit,btohqsg
ya so must research whether the uni course cares about poly course choice,btohqsg
Especially since some uni courses give 3 years to certain poly courses.,btohqsg
I see a lot of people wearing the outward bound shirt,btohqsg
Can’t be bothered to find out what it is tho,btohqsg
Huh  so what about outward bound with a different country on it?,btohqsg
I saw someone with the vietnam instead of singapore,btohqsg
Thought it was an international thing  tks for the info though,btohqsg
True story. If not it's just army like,btohqsg
idk nvr heard of overseas 1,btohqsg
What sort of camp besides army camp got no mixed gender??,btohqsg
Not like we have a lot of camps that had strenuous physical activities,btohqsg
Sorry la I ord after uni start,btohqsg
School start Aug 10 or something,btohqsg
Kenot la but I spam me leave,btohqsg
And ord Aug 7 or 8,btohqsg
I thought they say can disrupt for studies due to some equity thingy?,btohqsg
Still can't do ug camp tho,btohqsg
Mine was a few years back Liao I didn't know shit about equity,btohqsg
It is the same reason for rank promotion(something along the lines of superior cannot upgrade you to a rank that is higher than the highest rank in the batch or something like that),btohqsg
I know ppl ord 1-2 weeks early to go uni camp,btohqsg
1-2 weeks is too little but also okay lah since January intake pple have only 1 mnth to party before enlisting,btohqsg
At least it is before uni camp still so,btohqsg
Does that mean they have to come back for 1-2 weeks after uni,btohqsg
Maybe reservist extend 1 week or something lorh,btohqsg
they usually go back during summer break to serve the remaining time,btohqsg
ask S1 to help you settle,btohqsg
i help one guy go uni before  he started uni in jul but ord aug,btohqsg
But which batch did he enlist though,btohqsg
When they say low community cases needed for phase 2 how low do they mean,btohqsg
How low do you think they mean*,btohqsg
But tbh probably less than 100,btohqsg
I thought directives say cannot lol,btohqsg
I mean I can't give you the exact reference number,btohqsg
Was reading it a few months ago,btohqsg
But maybe I misread it lol,btohqsg
its approval to go uni while still in service,btohqsg
aka your ord counter still going down while you go uni,btohqsg
Er....I show relevant events relevant to my course(not as a list of events lah but what I did during that event).Also  I tried to show what traits I have and have learnt from the events as well as show how I can contribute to the school and how the school contribute to me (like overseas learning  more opportunites in research  stuff that can help you build wellbeing etc.)Try to have an introduction(introduce yourself and why you want to go there) and conclusion (why you are a good candidate  what can you help the school in return),btohqsg
Personal statement in computer; you use pencil write? 😂,btohqsg
But ur chances are 0% if u dun try... so,btohqsg
Ucas personal statements are like the opposite of relevant to DSA cause they mainly focus on academics,btohqsg
The bot will let u post pics/links after 1 day in this group,btohqsg
"The first part of advice given in the website can be relevant if you manipulate to something about leadership.Taking the first advice for example  ""That you have read more widely than just the set texts at school"". Instead of writing what is said above  it can be manipulated to ""demonstrating leadership outside of school"".",btohqsg
Anyone here play with road bikes?,btohqsg
other than play what u do with ur bikes,btohqsg
thats what i meant by play - -,btohqsg
play in bike terms is to cycle,btohqsg
Haha I thought like it was some mobile app sia 😂,btohqsg
no legit who got play with road bikes b4,btohqsg
thats why i just say play with bikes,btohqsg
A lot of bike philes in the park,btohqsg
Don’t have to be a chemist to make meth,btohqsg
I tot u looking for cycling mates@yukeming,btohqsg
Good bikes or brand to rec?,btohqsg
mine is a hybrid fixie and road bike hah,btohqsg
I dk wat kind u looking for in terms of specs,btohqsg
Shud ask my friend ah he last time spent like 800+ buy road bike,btohqsg
Dun worry this one not bike,btohqsg
Dont buy if it doesnt look good as you,btohqsg
U can be my lab assistant,btohqsg
You guys rlly willing to spent tht much,btohqsg
Happy World Environment Day 🌏Fellow Singaporeans  look beyond our shores  we're all inter-dependent in this region. Let's join our ASEAN neighbours to operate joint environmental sustainability projects.Do you know someone that is passionate about solving environment / climate issues in Singapore & Southeast Asia region?,btohqsg
I was cycling 50k a day. Buy a good one worth,btohqsg
Eh so what's the spec u bought,btohqsg
My bro bought an 8k ultegra de,btohqsg
Anyone interested in environment/climate issues? Or probably studying or doing a thesis on it? 3-5K grant to support these projects,btohqsg
I'll just stop at 1.8k max,btohqsg
Actually buy that kind of bike better than buy in UK bo,btohqsg
Every time I search for bike and review alwaysco.uk,btohqsg
Frame size L800*520mmshiman 2 x11 speed,btohqsg
Hobby ma and I like cycling,btohqsg
Cycle from sembawang to Tampines and back,btohqsg
mine changi-amk bishan park and bck,btohqsg
Tht timr i cycle from tamp to ecp,btohqsg
The thing is use road bike isn't very tiring,btohqsg
Only problem is water not enough,btohqsg
my next target  is to go from changi to je,btohqsg
My wifi lag tats why it just send -,btohqsg
Are we allowed to cycle together bo,btohqsg
Huh I didn't know you girl,btohqsg
Do I sound like a guy TT-TT,btohqsg
Ok la then July can ride together is it,btohqsg
and wait till they remove the mask rule also,btohqsg
U don’t have to wear mask while cycling,btohqsg
Sports activities gonna be like dk when,btohqsg
I was almost fine for not wearing mask,btohqsg
I broke my collar bone navigating a bend at 50kph,btohqsg
If u r doing intensive activities then it’s ok,btohqsg
About a month after we get CB round 2,btohqsg
I was at water cooler drinking water then got some nea come up to me ask me where my mask,btohqsg
They scared water cooler got covid,btohqsg
How to drink water with mask on,btohqsg
Actually now they shut all cooler le,btohqsg
My bike and then the person give me warning on fine,btohqsg
Stuck at home for sibei long never exercise,btohqsg
U can do many other exercises at home,btohqsg
Haiz  it has been a long time since I actually rode a bike. Now my bike is rusted :/,btohqsg
Is anyone in the east ( specifically at Changi area) has wifi issue right now.,btohqsg
Passing through the mask will sterilise the food,btohqsg
I didn't buy before from them,btohqsg
Sorry but we do not allow advertisements here,btohqsg
Waow my brain is fried after seeing the question in o/n study group 😵,btohqsg
Now I'm scared of taking fmath in jc 😭,btohqsg
Nope  I am planning to take pfml,btohqsg
Waow CFML  I can't tolerate chemistry 😥,btohqsg
I can't tolerate how attractive it is,btohqsg
Nice mock  I heard that you are doing university chemistry right now.,btohqsg
huh where did you get that info from,btohqsg
pharmacy = applied chemistry = applied applied physics = applied applied applied math = (applied)^3 math,btohqsg
All I am is just a frail girl,btohqsg
Took PCMe in JC  regretted not taking H1 Lit,btohqsg
Join ACJC debate to become a confident and powerful person,btohqsg
Tbh I thought you were a guy cus I have a male friend named that lol,btohqsg
Yes I have successfully converted one person,btohqsg
Can I join more than 1 cca in acjc?,btohqsg
As many as you can take,btohqsg
Approved promotion from@FW199Theunistudent.com  a blog about A levels and uni,btohqsg
What's so special about 2? Names should be pansexual! Else they are sexist!,btohqsg
Wait you were airforce in ns?,btohqsg
You probably get asked this a lot but did you fly a jet or smtg,btohqsg
Uh@cauchycriterion  just wondering  what are you doing currently (uni  work etc.)  you are so active and it seems like you know everything lol so just wondering,btohqsg
Only regulars get to be pilots  and it is very difficult to be selected,btohqsg
My usual active periods are when I’m on the 1.5h transport from home to work,btohqsg
I haven’t applied for my first choice yet  technically,btohqsg
But yes it’s my first choice in SG,btohqsg
A privellege ill experience in about 1 and a half more yeats,btohqsg
Y do u sound like u didn’t know,btohqsg
Idrk what to write about the benifits it can bring about,btohqsg
But like i wanna know how specific must i go into explaining how it works in Essays,btohqsg
Let’s just say that I would be Gatsby’s junior,btohqsg
I think for technical stuff you only need to describe very summarily how it works,btohqsg
The effects of the stuff are far more relevant than the mechanics,btohqsg
All my PES C friends stay out,btohqsg
I hope I'm not that suay,btohqsg
I just hope I don't stay in,btohqsg
Stay in not so bad if it’s a couple days in a week,btohqsg
So i just say it edits gene which could allow scientists to discover how diseases affect human,btohqsg
Them perhaps say there could be a panacea to certain diseases?,btohqsg
There’s logic between ‘edits gene’ and ‘discover how diseases affects humans’ that you should explain  but this should be fine,btohqsg
A panacea that only affects certain diseases is not a panacea,btohqsg
Could one day find a cure for all diseases,btohqsg
Would that be too far fetched?,btohqsg
Or could be a panacea for diseases,btohqsg
Right now we can’t even imagine curing cancer,btohqsg
if you sent to stay in unit you'll need to stay in,btohqsg
And you better hope you don't tio 3 SIR,btohqsg
