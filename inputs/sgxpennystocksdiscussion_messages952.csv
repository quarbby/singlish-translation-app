🎢All is well.We conclude that the latest FOMC meeting announcement provides some insight into the path towards a September rate cut. The FOMC statement  which reflects the tone of improvement in inflation and the fact that job growth has somewhat moderated  shows encouraging signs.The highlight came in the FOMC conference  where Fed Chairman Jerome Powell provided further insights and discussed the possibility of a September rate cut in the next meeting. The overall discussion and Q&A session were given in a more neutral tone. The Fed is still data-dependent  and all options are on the table. That's Powell's style.With the September cut possibility alive  the recent pullback in equity could see relief support as investors turned their attention to Friday's job report and incoming earnings report.Till then  volatility is our neighbour.,btohqsg

Part 1 of 2Mencast having little or no volume going into the HY results. (Note: Based on the last several years  the results usually comes out 8th to 14th Aug)Event Timeline :- The spill was sparked by Netherlands-flagged dredger Vox Maxima hitting Singapore-flagged bunker vessel Marine Honour at Pasir Panjang Terminal at about 2.20pm on Friday. This happened on the 14th June 24.- Mencast featured in Straits Time where a picture taken on the 21st June 24 showed that showing a bag of treated sand in their treatment facility.DYODDSource:https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/oil-spill-sentosa-pasir-panjang-cleanup-wildlife-400-tonnes-4418371,btohqsg
Part 2 of 2Hence  we can assume the job was given out in short notice to mencast due to urgency. Also  i believe most businesses also charge a premium when doing urgent jobs? (Also  the entire exercise likely to be claimable by insurance?) Therefore  this unfortunate incident likely to have benefited mencast  financially wise IMO.The question here is whether a part of this mencast project will fall under the upcoming HY? (Up til 30th June 24) It is probable that downpayment/progressive claims would have been requested and if so  reflect in the upcoming results. Therefore  this one could be a good results bet.

Hope they were smart enough to strike a settle on a good deal. Any rush/emergency job  I don’t think people need to dive to get jobs.Most businesses will quote high. I’m not sure what’s the competition for such business but the barriers of entry does seems high with all the required facilities.Also  if the awarding party knows or believes they can probably claim the insurance from the vessel that caused this spill  then lesser need for the negotiations because there is simply not much time for it. Further delay will mean more damage to control,btohqsg

❗⛈️📉  The STI Index declined by nearly 3% following a selloff on Wall Street last Friday  significantly impacting the banking sector.DBS (D05):If today's closing price establishes support near the 200MA  a rebound is possible. Otherwise  the next support level is approximately $32.15.OCBC (O39):  If this stock can maintain support around $14.12  a potential rebound is possible. However  failure to hold this level may result in a further decline to approximately $13.60.UOB (U11) A rebound is possible if the closing price remains above the support level of $30.27. However  if it fails to hold  the price may decline further to $29.55.It is advisable to closely monitor for the formation of a base before considering re-entering the buy position.🔺Disclaimer: Pls. do your own study before buying and selling.,btohqsg
