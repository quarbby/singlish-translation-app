BK and KFC also introduced new burgers,btohqsg
i ended up buying 2 burgers to eat by myself,btohqsg
Coz the queue for free burgers was too long so you bought your own?,btohqsg
ran out of stock by the time i got there and asked the store manager,btohqsg
lady luck wasn't on our side i guess üò¢,btohqsg
Seems like McD has free stuff from time to time. Better luck next time~~,btohqsg
tried to stop eating mac but only last 2 weeks üíÄ,btohqsg
i have not eaten macs in 2 months,btohqsg
I wake up to see an entire essay... Singapore is a small ass country proportional representation could literally be along the lines of party list PR which is what Korea has for the National Assembly. Keeps the FPTP system while making sure the national vote tallies with the same amount of seats.,btohqsg
The spolier effect is a separate issue which I think is almost impossible to fix in our current political climate. Ranked Choice Voting is sometime I desperately want as well but it will never happen precisely because the parties will lose power immediately when implemented. I don't think anyone even the strongest sinkie will vote 10/10 for a PAP candidate,btohqsg
Not to mention ret*rds who have no idea how those work.. we have trouble getting boomers to even cross a fucking box properly ffs,btohqsg
imo a 3 seat GRC system+direct proportional voting might work bttr,btohqsg
Fuck the GRC system just make them all into SMCs,btohqsg
U want racial equality sure. Make certain districts disproportionatly Indian or Malay Voters,btohqsg
Either that or designate that certain SMCs can only have candidates of that race,btohqsg
wouldnt the taiwanese system be bttr then?,btohqsg
I mean we literally model it based on that system,btohqsg
Exactly the GRC itself was so they could pack districts,btohqsg
the SG system doesnt allow for defections,btohqsg
It doesn't even allow for PAP MPs to vote otherwise lmao,btohqsg
Even so most dun dare say no,btohqsg
when have they even lifted the whip?,btohqsg
i remb once it was on a abortion bill in SG  they lifted it,btohqsg
and even if WP comes in power  its not like the whip will be lifted for WP,btohqsg
The NMP scheme I think TCB voted against that,btohqsg
that goes to the extent of UK  US elections,btohqsg

Using an open list or closed list?,btohqsg
Still maintains party autonomy to choose,btohqsg
Tbh even with multi cornered fights as long as the opposition party contesting is not reputable they won‚Äôt win much votes. Just look at the 1992 Marine Parade grc by election and Pasir Punggol grc in 2020.But yeah it does help increase participation and Oppo parties are more likely to field candidates in more constituencies,btohqsg
lol maybe we can just have supplementary voting at least? Can‚Äôt be that hard to get people to understand how to tick a second box,btohqsg
With GRC tho even the smallest vote share is like enough in terms of gaining 1-2 seats,btohqsg
Some seats were less than 4 percentage points from being won by the opposition  if those seats were won we would have had quite a few more opposition MPs then,btohqsg
Dk if it's just tactical voting but still means 30-40k ppls votes just remains unrepresented,btohqsg
It have never found a single pap MP who actually voted against it lol. At most it was just an abstention. tan Cheng bock who claimed he did but apparently he was lying  I checked all the parliamentary records and those motions against the NMP scheme he voted against  the whip was lifted. When the constitution was amended to increase the number of NMPs and the whip was not lifted  TCB merely abstained instead of voting against. But at least they still can choose to just not vote at all if they strongly disagree with the government. Inderjit Singh did exactly dad for the population white paper in 2013,btohqsg
He did not actually vote against the whip,btohqsg
Tbh I find it surprising none of the pap members bothered exposing it but wtv lol,btohqsg
I mean he did receive a warning for the action tho,btohqsg
Dk if it's just the threat of voting against,btohqsg
If we do that it‚Äôs better since old ppl won‚Äôt figure out how to do RCV with party list lol. But Australia has been doing that in some state elections and I think for their senate too,btohqsg
Pap MPs have complained about it in debates too,btohqsg
Back in the 90s it was especially after the kicking of Barisan out,btohqsg
At the end of the day they still vote Aye,btohqsg
Our standing rules are a fucking joke as well,btohqsg
In the past when GCT wanted to introduce the NMP scheme there was this sunset clause to appease many of the pap MPs who were uncomfortable of implementing it. So at the beginning of each parliament term  in order to have NMPs they would have to pass a motion that ‚Äúthis parliament should have NMPs‚Äù. TCB voted against all of them at the start of each parliament  and in 2002  pap MP Leong horn Kee joined him. But the motions all had the whip lifted so TCB never voted against any of them. In 1990  TCB voted for the NMP scheme when the whip was not lifted  and in 1997 when the constitution was amended to provide up to 9 NMPs from 6 previously  TCB abstained.,btohqsg
Yeah but also they can choose not to vote by not being present in the chamber. It does feel weird if the MP speaks against it but is forced to vote for it though,btohqsg
Even if abstain the motion will still pass assuming quorum,btohqsg
From the 2002 motion to have NMPsMr Leong Horn Kee (Bishan-Toa Payoh):Mr Speaker  Sir  first  I would like to thank you for allowing me to join in this debate on Nominated MPs (NMPs).The objective of the NMP scheme is  of course  laudable. As explained by theLeader of the House  Mr Wong  the addition of up to nine NMPs will add to the quality of the debate in this House. I surmise therefore that the NMP scheme is introduced not so much due to the lack of PAP MPs  but to overcome the lack of opposing and discerning views in Parliament  arising from the lack of Opposition MPs.Sir  allow me to state my case on why I feel that for this new Parliament  there is no need for an NMP scheme  in spite of the fact that there continues to be a paucity of Opposition Members in this House. I would like to bring up some new angles  instead of what some Members have claimed to be old angles  as raised by Dr Tan Cheng Bock. There are many reasons why this new term of Parliament could do away with NMPs. I think the NMP scheme has been useful in the past  but I think it will serve limited use in the future.My first point is that for this new session of Parliament  the PAP Whip will be lifted. That makes a big difference. The Leader of the House has said that in cases of certain Bills that are not critical - even the PM himself has said so - he will allow PAP MPs to speak up  which means that now  except for some critical Bills  we have a new body of MPs to take on issues - the PAP MPs. With this new Parliament  the new PAP MPs  as well as the old PAP MPs  can therefore speak with more conviction and freedom. Their views on Government policy can be more engaging. In the past  we all know that the PAP MPs' mouths had been gagged. We could not speak up  because there was a Whip behind us.Some hon. Members:No.Mr Leong Horn Kee:You can speak against it  but you have to vote for it. It sounds very illogical. Anyway  now that the Whip has been lifted for those who want to speak  I think they can speak more readily and more heartily. But  of course  they have to be responsible for whatever they say. Therefore  I think we do not need more NMPs  because we already have such a large body of PAP MPs. This is one major difference.Sir  the second difference I would like to say is that we now have a large quantity and quality of MPs  and new PAP MPs  in this Parliament. There are 24 new PAP MPs and one new NCMP. Certainly  with these 25 new faces put together  and with the old existing veteran MPs  what more views can be offered in this House and not more effective that can be covered.We have heard how well most of the MPs who have spoken - all the 50-over of them - how well they have covered their points  and how eloquent they are. As you have seen  even including a poem by my GRC colleague  Dr Ng Eng Hen. And also we just saw this morning how well a new Minister of State  Dr Balaji  had fielded the barrage of questions from the other MPs. Many of these questions are from the new MPs themselves. So these are examples that we are going to have good debate in this House with this new crop of good MPs.Sir  even the hon. Member  Mr Chiam - I remember he told me just two days ago - that it was most refreshing to hear our new PAP MPs speak. Is that not right?Mr Chiam See Tong:Right.,btohqsg
You can see also that some pap MPs were dissatisfied with the party whip  but tbh most political parties in Singapore would rather have them for the sake of stability,btohqsg
Oh don't get me wrong a party whip is still a role that needs to be done.,btohqsg
