Hi gurus can i ask what would make you choose crmc over citi premiermiles and vise versa?,btohqsg
My main spending card is also Live Fresh. U may want to consider pairing with Citi Rewards Mastercard (CRMC).,btohqsg
It is a 5% cashback card correct?,btohqsg
So if I spend $400 on Online  $400 on Visa Paywave... i get $40 cashback.,btohqsg
5% or 10% (if merchant belongs to the 'Sustainable Spend' category).,btohqsg
i had look at sustainable spend category... sadly none i patronise.,btohqsg
There was supposed to be a revamp of the Cashback but i think it got indefinitely postponed.. Maybe DBS found out about potential MS so they killed it?,btohqsg
would just like to add.. if you are used to this sort of spending pattern:1. Half on Online Spend2. Half on Mobile Wallet Spend (e.g. ApplePay)actually UOB Evol is a better card than DBS Live Fresh. Just watch out for UOB$ merchants which are excluded spend.$300+$300 for $40 cashback per month = 6.67% cashback.,btohqsg
How do you know if it’s successful? I didn’t receive any sms back to say I am enrolled in the program,btohqsg
hello would like to ask if we are using shopback pay (payment taken from credit card) does it classify as contactless or online spend?,btohqsg
Hi   anyone know what is the charges foreign transaction fee for all bank credit card?,btohqsg
Anyone tried using Trust debit card to withdraw from ATM in Bali ? Any challenge?,btohqsg

Hi  anybody knows driving/riding school fees can earn miles/cashback using CRMC or Revo please?,btohqsg
Thanks for adding on. I have UOB One card. Main purpose is to meet the UOB One account criterion for bonus interest. Can UOB Evol take its place as well?,btohqsg
I think that depends on the MCC of the school? I assume you are referring to both big and small schools that we go to get our licenses 😂,btohqsg
yeah.. pretty curious about that. i checked heymax and whatcard like don't have,btohqsg
Does using amaze card paired with CRMC in overseas allow for a tax refund? Anyone can help? Many thanks!,btohqsg
Oh ok thanks! Cos I know Youtrip doesn’t allow right?,btohqsg
many thanks! it is interesting I got 3 results with 'center' and 0 with 'centre' and 'school',btohqsg
anyway u can tax refund to any card  no need to be the card used for the transactions. Collected knowledge here suggest refunding to revolut in the local currency  this allows converting to sgd using revolut rates and can transfer out to bank.,btohqsg
Do you know when using amaze  should we select the foreign currency or SGD to be charged to?,btohqsg
always charge to the local currency of the foreign country.,btohqsg
Slightly different experience with Amaze card on Uber AUD transactions confirm that the rates are better than the bank rates.Personally  I suggest mode of tax refund to be in cash if possible. Immediate usage of the tax refund cash for airport makan and shopping.,btohqsg
When would your next trip be? I think the folks quite familiar with paying $5 for atm withdrawal using YouTrip card. So if you or someone can share the Trust Bank experience  I think is beneficial to the folks here.,btohqsg
Used Trust with 7/11 atm. Fee was 220 yen.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing.S$2.50. Abt the price of McDonald coffee ☺️,btohqsg
Seems like Mastercard will be free? According to this websitehttps://asocialnomad.com/japan/atms-fees-japan/#ATM_Fees_in_Japan_-_ATM_Transaction_Limits_in_Japan,btohqsg
tax refund in cash.. usually get a few % lesser.,btohqsg
Anyone know if the miles can be extended after 3 years?,btohqsg
I had 2 different experiences with global blue recently. Both paid with Amaze linked to credit card.one forcefully converted my EUR tax refund into SGD and refunded my linked credit card in SGD even though I specified Revolut to receive the tax refundone credited my EUR into my specified card in Global Blue app which was Revolut in EURIf you want to play safe  especially big amounts which normal credit card will burst the reward cap  just use Revolut to pay and receive refund.,btohqsg
how exactly they forcefully refund to the linked credit card?,btohqsg
meaning i specified to Global Blue to send the Tax Refund to my Revolut card (I provided my Revolut card details).say the tax refund expected is EUR100. End up  I got EUR100 converted into SGD and sent to my current linked mastercard with Amaze.,btohqsg
My GUESS is if the merchant provides your credit card details to Global Blue  Global Blue will refund to the original card  regardless of your preference.If the merchant withholds your credit card details (e.g. said you paid in cash or what)  then Global Blue will refund to the card of your choice specified in Global Blue app.GUESSING ONLY. NOT ENOUGH DP TO CONCLUDE.,btohqsg
Do u get 5% on telco payments?,btohqsg
You have to read the TNC for exclusions.https://www.dbs.com.sg/iwov-resources/media/pdf/cards/live-fresh-cashback-tnc.pdfThe term I never liked is Utility since telephone bills can be loosely deemed to be Utilities too.And from what I understand there is always some confusion/inconsistency over whether a recurring bill is treated as online or not.To be safe for my household:1. all telco bills go to Maybank Family and Friends (confirmed 8% cashback).2. all SP Power bills go to UOB One (confirmed 4.33% cashback).,btohqsg
My Tax Refund using Amaze card recently from Sweden via global Blue (GB) - no option for me to choose currency to received.GB just refund me in SGD (show in their portal/app - conversion from GB not from Amaze).i had switch to wallet to receive tax refund (not sure will deduct mile/cash rebate if tax refund direct into link card),btohqsg
yes if paid via telco website/app and payment mode coded as online,btohqsg
So for HSBC EGA  must wait for their sms to say you are in the program?,btohqsg
no consistently received. Sometimes you qualified but no SMS received.i did hear of a horror story someone sms in  got the acknowledgement but end up HSBC say some error he is not qualified (THIS STORY IS UNVERIFIED THOUGH),btohqsg
Weird leh cuz I paid via website for zero1 using amaze>crmc no 10x leh,btohqsg
yeah  its erratic  until i also lost count which month am i in,btohqsg
was this your first payment or was it the recurring bill that didn't earn you 10x?,btohqsg
Was the first sign up payment,btohqsg
actually can u also educate me ah.. for this sort of telco payments / recurring payments... how are you able to use Amaze + linked card?do u have to keep your linked card set at a certain period of the month  ready for Zero1 to do the recurring deduction?,btohqsg
Yup! But for me  I primarily only connect crmc so not an issue. My only problem is this zero1 mcc  cuz I do get 10x for giga,btohqsg
pretty sure it is not the MCC issue because Maybank Family and Friends also go by MCC for the 8% cashback and I have no issue with Zero1 initial payment or monthly recurring payments getting 8%.,btohqsg
Maybe zero1 is exactly the case I was referring to whereby details entered into the online portal does not necessarily translate to it being processed as an online transaction? Although I thought any transaction processed by Amaze is treated as online?,btohqsg
Yea exactly  so it shouldn't be excluded unless it's considered travel  which is highly unlikely. Maybe I'll chat and check with citi,btohqsg
Should be on 5th or 6th,btohqsg
