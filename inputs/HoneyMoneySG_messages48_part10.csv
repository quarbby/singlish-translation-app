Hey folks  for switching from DBS Woman Card to DBS World Woman Card (WWC). Are dbs points earned from the two cards pooled together? I like the points earned from the  Woman Card to be accumulated with the WWC (I just got the card today). Anyone who have switched can advise me?,btohqsg

How do you know your account is not closed automatically or they continue to charge you $25 a month?,btohqsg
I was thinking i had some money there but i didnt login for more than 5 years,btohqsg
Then i login and shocked they charged $25 a month and i called their 24 hours hotline.,btohqsg
Then that is a lot of money. $300 x 5 years. üò∞,btohqsg
NZD is on downtrend against SGD. SGD is appreciating,btohqsg

Wanna ask here in general anyone had experience in buying the money market funds? Do they credit returns monthly or annually? Considering to invest here rather than play juggling banks on deposits,btohqsg
Anyone know about this from Philips capital? Its about 4.5%,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt look guaranteed.Unless they pay more than juggling bank accounts which pay guaranteed  why buy mmfs?,btohqsg
Do read the t&cs. Up to $10 000 only for the first month. It's a MMF,btohqsg
Daily return accumulative for fullerton sgd,btohqsg

Hi bro  I am an AF member. Just charge to your instarem amaze and it should be online TX.,btohqsg
Its online spend  i charged it on my citi rewards MC.,btohqsg
Not via instaraem right? Cos this one Im considering its a VISA card,btohqsg
yes and upon first deposit  you have 7 days to max out the cap of $10k which will get the bonus 1.5% returns,btohqsg
+1 too. Was a member till next month. [In the process of cancelling]From what I usually see on my previous statement it seems like it's NOT an online payment by default (usually marked as recurring),btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think you can choose between visa and MC,btohqsg
Its a DBS live fresh card,btohqsg

To earn $300 means on1st Apr - bank has $x till 30th Apr (constant for easier calculation of ADB)1st May - bank has $x + $30 0001% of interests capped means interest returns of $300?And if the $300 would also include 1% based on card spend + 1% Giro transactions?,btohqsg
The accumulated daily return reflected is mark-to-market (unrealised) and subject to some market movements. Unlike bank  we get the declared interest credited to our account monthly.Similar to bank deposit  we can either withdraw the returns or the principal sum.Different from a bank  the cash cannot be withdrawn immediately. We  need to submit a sell order and it takes a few days for the MMF proceeds to be available in our bank account (for cash withdrawal).As the platform might take time to verify the ownership of our bank account  i suggest we designate a bank account for withdrawal in advance üòä.,btohqsg
Should be $x + $360 000 because it is one month interest of 1% per year of $360 000,btohqsg
To get consistent $300 for 4 months  one must have +$360k above previous month‚Äôs ADB üòÖ,btohqsg
Sorry a quick check with the community here. What is the SOP for  combining SQ rewards tix (redeem KF miles) with a paid ticket? Like buy tix first then redeem reward tix or vice versa or just buy two together and use KF miles to offset one tix.It's been a long time since I redeem my KF milesThanks for any quick advice =),btohqsg
There is no SOP.But usually you redeem the ticket first as you will need to check if there's the cheaper slots avail for booking.Then after that buy the remaining flight tickets.,btohqsg
The waitlist to get KF Saver rate means I have to anxiously monitor. I also have to bear the risks that seats might run out after the redemption transaction process completes (after the confirmation of the waitlist flight segment).,btohqsg
I haven't tried waitlist  usually I just go for the dates that are available or book much earlier in advance.,btohqsg
You can consider redeeming the return flight instead and go budget airline to the destination if you want to save money.,btohqsg
Thanks for this out of the box idea,btohqsg
Sorry  would like to check whether anyone here have such experience. As u folks rightly guess  I'm asking the question on behalf of someone else who is too shy to ask the question publicly here üòõ,btohqsg
Today Fraser got top up $100 get $110. Any one share if there is any 4mpd card to use ?,btohqsg
