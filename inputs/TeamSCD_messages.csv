Does anyone think that owning a classic car still worth in sg?,btohqsg
Putting in consideration that fella brought AE86 AT 100K+ and reselling over double the price brought. I would say yes ü§£,btohqsg
100k + or 200k+ can't rmb,btohqsg
Cus I saw a listing on Carousell,btohqsg
Got someone selling a Toyota Corolla wagon,btohqsg
I guess it really depends how you're into classics. Can't really put a price tag on it. I might be wrong  but I recall seeing 1 classic sold off at 750k. I might see wrong. Quite sometime ago,btohqsg
Car itself isn't a good investment ba. Let alone classic,btohqsg
One of the few gtt I saw during my car spotting,btohqsg
Skyline.. so much better than nismo,btohqsg
I'm singapore  they don't really take gd care of the cars  especially those classic  for example like dis gtt,btohqsg
No choice. Their maintenance fking chor,btohqsg
2 yrs back I almost bought 1  the condition of the interior is very bad ...,btohqsg
hw can 1 be buying but don't wanna do on the maintenance,btohqsg
But got some really maintain it damn well   but listed high price,btohqsg
I have seen people that can afford buying ferrari/lambo and couldn't afford maintenance bro,btohqsg
hw is dat h can afford buying but u can't afford to maintain,btohqsg
Buy already  for some reason. You go broke lo,btohqsg
I think dat equals to  can't afford,btohqsg
Think some is because of business or Èù¢Â≠êÈóÆÈ¢ò,btohqsg
Are u the blue black skyline gt last Friday at Mount Faber?,btohqsg
u guys saw dat  driving a gtr wit 4k fines,btohqsg
of course. comes wit a price and some comes wit ridiculous price,btohqsg
A lot car enthusiast favourite place,btohqsg
Night time is where all the classic and modern car,btohqsg
Got to becareful. Heard MFP 99ban up they have camera hidden  any car looking illegal or speeding up will trigger tp nearby to go up,btohqsg
are you the tiktok girl that drove a matte pink Audi?,btohqsg
Cus got a tiktok person promote this gr,btohqsg

Well  people saw a group that has potential and start advertising I supposed,btohqsg
Any one know where can I purchase the Defi Analogue/Digital Gauge that doesn‚Äôt get data from ECU?,btohqsg

Rhd Japan has authentic sets. But extremely pricey. On carousell you can find ppl selling OEMs for defi gauges,btohqsg

Cos my car only compatible is bc,btohqsg
Those unknown what like border also compatible,btohqsg
Check le not compatible   friend drives dc5 use d2 also quite harsh,btohqsg
Personal preference ah. D2 my friend say until he wet,btohqsg

Using bc br... Previous car bc v1. So far ok for me. No real complains,btohqsg
Waiting for u add ur frenz in or promote in ur car group,btohqsg
My car they complain car too loud rather then uncomfortable üòÇ,btohqsg
But so far no one ever mentioned about comfort,btohqsg
The bc br for me feels better,btohqsg
Ya for drivers no complains from my end too,btohqsg
The v1 last time I used on 09 cerato when new  damn hard. Took about 2 months before it became softer,btohqsg
U all early morning talk abt vroom vroom alr,btohqsg
The br came with my current car. So already seasoned.,btohqsg
But when it was hard  the car felt faster for some reason. Just that those small humps damn rough.,btohqsg
Mine that time  after a week I had to go back workshop tighten the coilovers. So if you hear vibration  is the spring start to season then it become loose. Need to go workshop tighten.,btohqsg
Also my bump stopper had to remove.,btohqsg
Got ppl mention bc v1 less harsh,btohqsg
The others say v1 will oil leak,btohqsg
I think car weight also play a part,btohqsg
V1 I used less then a year  then sold,btohqsg
Similar someone also had isses with v1 being squeaky,btohqsg
But think ur advise was good,btohqsg
Yeah... I feel I got a bit more dampening on the br. But I think is because the accord is much heavier then the cerato,btohqsg
the car can‚Äôt even start up,btohqsg
Have quite a few in sg. In this group got one more,btohqsg
Not all is euro R variant,btohqsg
The new accords 1.5 turbo no idea why no 2 litre,btohqsg
For bcbr on Cerato 19  you need time for it to season.. but once it sits you don‚Äôt look back..,btohqsg
I‚Äôm driving Cerato 19 too ‚úåüèº,btohqsg
Another nice guy think got workshop,btohqsg
any workshop sell meter gauge? can recommend?,btohqsg
Thought me is no friend club,btohqsg

Issue with forte mainly is ecu ba,btohqsg
My previous cerato quite ok... 09 Manual one. At first keep going left  change to coil overs then can go straight. Also ignition coil died once. But that's about it.,btohqsg
ECU I did the preventive maintenance thing at harmony. But now when I think Abt it  expensive to do that,btohqsg
