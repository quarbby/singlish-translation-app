Guys w these are cute but not my type,btohqsg
Time to get A for H2 math. Which i think i gonna get a B or a C HAHAHA,btohqsg
Noble gases have weak interatomic forces and have lost boiling and melting point and dun hv to form bonds. Why is it that elements have to form bonds to have a higher boiling and melting point?,btohqsg
Its not bec of atomic bonds that lead to higher bp and mp,btohqsg
Its bec of stronger intermolecular/atomic forces of attraction,btohqsg
Then why noble gases have weak forces,btohqsg
Cuz like its stable alr  shldnt it want to stay stable?,btohqsg
They don't (usually) form bonds with other atoms,btohqsg
"When we say intermolecular/interatomic forces of attraction we mean the forces that's ""making"" the individual molecules ""stick"" together",btohqsg
It's different from the forces keeping the atoms in a molecule together,btohqsg
I understand but I dont understand,btohqsg
So whys the boiling point low,btohqsg
Should be itâ€™s boiling point is low because itâ€™s gas at room temperature,btohqsg
Itâ€™s a gas because of low BP  not that itâ€™s low BP because itâ€™s a gas,btohqsg
Cause noble gases have weak interatomic forces of attraction,btohqsg
Anyway I'm no Chem god lmao imma let@jianjun21do it,btohqsg
time to quit chemistry and go back to cs,btohqsg
isnt it cuz they are covalent bonds,btohqsg
Can ask you too since youâ€™re partly neon,btohqsg
