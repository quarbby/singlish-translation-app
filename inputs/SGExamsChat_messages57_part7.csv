Feel free to report spam and leave,btohqsg
Cause they’ve been taking members from this group,btohqsg

Remember to turn on your privacy settings so that you can’t be added into random groups!,btohqsg
LOL chill ah guys some of them can potentially be good business partners!!,btohqsg
I'm also randomly added into three groups,btohqsg
By someone with a US phone number,btohqsg
Would you do business with someone who effectively advertises on your group against your will?,btohqsg
Wtf nobody seems to understand sarcasm and to be neutral before taking a harsh stand!! Bye I am with the boomers,btohqsg
smh u dont understand john's highly advanced form of post-meta irony,btohqsg
and where did u get this info,btohqsg
Ceh dont doxx  even if the dude is annoying,btohqsg
and secondly  if it's not public info  das doxxing,btohqsg
It’s corroborated by someone else’s testimony from last year,btohqsg
Seems like the guy was in some groups before and got into some arguments with some people,btohqsg
Yes  we deleted it cause it’s doxxing,btohqsg
But we appreciate the info on the fake accounts,btohqsg
You are free to insult our admins here though,btohqsg
If you know more please let us know,btohqsg
He created many trouble in many groups,btohqsg
I thought it is public info.,btohqsg
you think i think who confirm,btohqsg
A Privacy AnnouncementOver the past couple of days  you may or may not have been added to a random group you’ve never heard of. This is because the owner of that group is scraping users from the SGExams groups to artificially inflate their numbers.To avoid this happening to you  do remember tochange your privacy settings so that not everybody can add you to groups!To do so  just go to Settings->Privacy and Security->Groups and Channels->My contacts.Have a good day!Telegram rules and guidelines,btohqsg
an F for our fallen comrade in arms...,btohqsg
I think “gerlyn” is busy student,btohqsg
@khotl73you see medicalgiant has been adding people from this group. All the accounts in there are fake,btohqsg
So you mean he is talking to himself there ?,btohqsg
why would he want to do that zzz,btohqsg
It’s an unethical way of making a big group,btohqsg
But why do those people still stay there if they dont like to be added ? They can leave the group,btohqsg
id go march right in tell them to shove the group up their ass,btohqsg
The issue is that he’s going to someone else’s group and taking their members without permission,btohqsg
It’s just as good as posting ads on a huge group without the owner’s permission,btohqsg
So what can u do abt it?,btohqsg
meh but like the members are not value adding leh what's the use HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Nothing  except warn our users about it,btohqsg
but they just gonna leave the grp or not talk or be like milo HAHAHA,btohqsg
He add unwilling people. But these ppl dont chat,btohqsg
the assumption is people don't give a shit,btohqsg
I still see a lot in the grp sia,btohqsg
he created many fake accounts to chat among themselves,btohqsg
It’s for the sake of money,btohqsg
Having a large Telegram grp will have money meh,btohqsg
seems perfectly normal for the internet,btohqsg
He charges people to post ads on the group,btohqsg
lmao advertise to his non value adding members,btohqsg
He keeps attacking other groups and support his own group,btohqsg
Ppl will then defect to his group,btohqsg
