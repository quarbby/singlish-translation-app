Hi  can I check why Trip (4722) transactions are not earning 10x points with HSBC Revolution despite being in the eligible list?,btohqsg
How do you know not earning 10x ? Bonus miles will only be credited next months.,btohqsg
ok thanks! i thought it would be credited within  the same month like citi rewards,btohqsg
Why you need to start a side hustle ASAPhttps://youtu.be/vLOR2n4kkus,btohqsg
Hi. Is there any hack for standard chartered bonus saver salary crediting i.e. similar case for uob one account salary hack,btohqsg
I.e By using dbs to transfer to sc via code 'SALA',btohqsg
Is property agent a good side hustle?,btohqsg
Hi folks  hope you can help me out on credit card strategy.- Spends on average $400-500 monthly- Spends mostly on kopitiam/restaurants/online spends- Currently using Standard chartered SMART Credit card (public transport  fast food  coffee places) & Simply cash 1.5% cash back credit card on everything elseI‚Äôm looking to maximise my credit card strategy  any suggestions?,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/pX5jktwpSIoAnyway found a REITS video today. But everytime their video very long and also say a lot of things but like never say is it worth it to buy anot. Watch like never watch.,btohqsg
Abit hard  u can try UOB EVOL. Mobile contactless + online spend. Need 600 spend though,btohqsg
Hsbc Revo could be a good choice which could get you 4mpd or 2.5% Cashback (3.5% with everyday+ rewards programme) no min spend,btohqsg
I thought I saw Techlead in your YouTube.,btohqsg
Only possible if you are 55 and above and has set aside the FRS or BRS with sufficient property charge,btohqsg
Please note that Revo don‚Äôt earn 10x for public transportation,btohqsg
Himay I ask is hsbc cc application always take a long time to process,btohqsg
they sometimes like to approve but dont tell you until 2 weeks later  can check the hsbc app to see if they issued you a virtual cc,btohqsg
Dur if straight up try and upsell then its kinda illegal (financial advise). All will say do your own risk reward analysis.AKA Do your own research.Almost every REIT is a good buy but relative to what price you buy at.,btohqsg
I apply as a new customer,btohqsg
you can log in still  just create an account,btohqsg
also you need to consider what kind of REITS suits you.mainly Commercial  Hospitality  Logistics.some are higher risk swings some are defensive plays.a common good indicator is the P/B ratio but this does not take into account the future prospects and debt ratio of the trust.,btohqsg
Thank you so much for your advise. I faced quite some people advise against buy REITS. But i felt i want to have a diversified portfolio. I want some shares  REITS  S&P  T bills  MMF.,btohqsg
"only 2 reasons i can think why they are against REITS  they are stock investors can get high return (ya but at higher risk)Financial ""guru"" telling you to get investment linked plans instead.But ultimately REITS are between bonds - equity risk wise. some what similar to buying property with consistent dividend and some minor upside in price appreciation.Of course they are not for everyone as they are more ""boring"" and dividends may not be reinvested (may have to do it yourself)",btohqsg
What OCBC/DBS credit card would your recommend for lower spenders,btohqsg
I would argue everyone should be the CEO of their life and start learning how to market and sell themselves. If you are reputable enough you can build your personal brand and don't have to depend on a reputable company for branding purposes. But start building transferable skills and more side hustles,btohqsg
Not financial advice but stay clear of ILPs most are front loaded and you are basically paying agent commission for the first few years/months,btohqsg
Reit has same factor exposure of small cap value + bonds  but with additional idiosyncratic sectoral risk. In layman term  reits does not provide additional diversification benefits that stocks and bonds alr gives. In fact. Adding reits may lower risk adjusted return.,btohqsg
Thank you for your input. Is lower risk adjusted return a good thing? üòÖ too chiem for me,btohqsg
Just FYI ..  FavePay is not an eligible 10X rewards transactions for DBS Womans Card.,btohqsg
hello guys  I have both citi rewards & miles card. Currently I have a upcoming dues for my AIA insurance premiums. Am I able to earn any rewards from any of my cards? Thanks in advance,btohqsg

Then there is this risk,btohqsg
I assume you are referring to your annual premium for AIA is due soon. Citi PayAll charge fees. It is like pay a fees to buy miles.Not sure how much is your annual premium. May be you wanna share. Think there is a few shifu that can help analyse the air miles you would be getting vs the fees you paid is value for money.,btohqsg
It is just a semi annual total of $3.6k. Thanks for your help,btohqsg
You need min of 8k in total before 20 Aug,btohqsg
For info .. FavePay for DBS Live Fresh Visa nerfed!,btohqsg
Hi all quick question  is Instarem+Citi Rewards better vs. Wise Card for payments overseas? As I don‚Äôt know each card‚Äôs FX spread,btohqsg
Wise Card for o/s spend has better exchange rate than Instarem. But Wise Card does not award customers for spending on its (apple green) debit card. Also  you need to consider in totality the benefits vs your administrative effort (man hours taken to apply  wait for card to come  activate card  monitor  pay bills  file e-statement  etc).,btohqsg
For me  I use my OCBC 90n and Cardup to pay my AIA annual premium which is about the same amount. I am a new user so the CardUp fees is 1.5%.https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/cards/90-degrees-travel-credit-card#popup-cardup,btohqsg
You still can use XNAP app. Far more superior. Else just skip store that only allow paynow or cash payment terms.,btohqsg
Thanks! Some shops such as those that sells Lights and Bathroom equipments other than cash  NETS and PayNow only accept GrabPay or FavePay.,btohqsg
Isn't favepay better than xnap. You get cashback with fave plus the card rewards. For xnap u only get card rewards,btohqsg
Agree. I stacked Live Fresh rebates and FavePay rewards (I curate a strategy). Now the strategy is torn apart by this DBS nerf.,btohqsg

isn't favepay been excluded from dbs livefresh for a long time already?,btohqsg
"Your reply misrepresents a study and is inaccurate. It's says ""returns have found to be similar to small cap + bonds.""In fact it found that there are many factors affecting the idiosyncratic risk.Other studies found that REITs may provide diversification but are time dependant.",btohqsg
Hi  can I understand if it is a good idea to pay for Esso petrol with KRIS+ app to get 20% miles from the paid amount?,btohqsg
Not sure if it is a right place to ask: I have some usd in my DBS my account want to exchange them into sgd  I saw the rate on DBS is not so good (1.32 but Google rate is 1.34)  is there any way I can reduce forex fee?,btohqsg
hi when i pay online with amaze card  i choose to pay in local currency to let amaze do the currency exchange to sgd  yes?,btohqsg
where can i find their FCY rates pls? is it more competitive than paying via other credit cards like Citibank?,btohqsg
you can only see the exact rate after the transaction. But it is roughly 2% markup on mastercard rate.Citibank charge 3.25% fx fee  on top of the master/visa rate.,btohqsg
Guys can I check how does Instarem works? For the linked cardsIf I'm overseas & I spend with Linked Credit Card (cash back card  Citi or HSBC) will I qualify for the 1.5+ cashback on all overseas merchant spends?,btohqsg
