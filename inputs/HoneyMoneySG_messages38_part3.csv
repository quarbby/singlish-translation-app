Hey  any one knows how long does UOB holds pending transactions? Mine is pending since 23 Mar.,btohqsg
The longest pending txm record with UOB i had is 5 days with a vending machine,btohqsg
Thanks mate. Seems like it is a norm,btohqsg
Generally I find UOB cards post one day with UOB merchants and mostly 2  sometimes 3 days with OCBC and DBS merchants. But this vending machine 5 days posting is really something seldom seen. I really try my best to see which merchants use UOB and which ones use OCBC/DBS,btohqsg
I see  this pending transaction of mine is from Senoko energy supply pte ltd,btohqsg
Hi  do I get the 1% cash back if I set up a standing order to pay off my HSBC credit card from my HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
Thanks  I will use CRCC XNAP to pay at food centre then. In this case I will get 1% via Giro.,btohqsg
Cmrc you mean. The reason why you won't get the 1% giro cashback for hsbc cards is that the 1% giro cashback is only applicable for paper giro. Hsbc does not allow you to set up paper giro for HSBC cards,btohqsg
Yes  CMRC. What is paper giro?,btohqsg
Paper GIRO means you download interbank GIRO form  fill it in manually and snail mail out the form.,btohqsg
Should do one for 2023 hehe :),btohqsg
Good evening  may I know if I can get 4MPD by UOB signature visa card if contactless pay for dental fee(around 1200SGD) like Q&M dental  thanks in advance.,btohqsg

My mind keep thinking citi bcos i wanted to apply for one ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
HSBC EGA  I tried applying online  they indicated they need 5 working days  how can I expedite it? Also the internet banking  they told me to go to branch to reactivate it.,btohqsg
ðŸ˜” aites im not the only one feeling this way,btohqsg
Nope. But after applying for the EGA account  they still indicated to give them 5 working days. And that online application of Internet Banking failed.,btohqsg
yup  did mine on a friday at closing hour  bank acct ready next day on a Saturday iirc,btohqsg
Noted  not sure if branch will still entertain given that I have already submitted my application online.,btohqsg
Sian the edga I think apply now I won't get in le.... I really should pay more attention here :(,btohqsg
you mean the HSBC EGA ? you may wait for next month promo,btohqsg
Oh? I thought the t&c only state till 31 march? Or you mean new promo :o?,btohqsg
best to go to branch setup. i registered on 1st Feb online  after that still got minor issues  all in all everything was resolved early this month.,btohqsg
almost every month will have promo  reference month different  so best to save a copy of your TnC,btohqsg
Yea i been seeing people all saying got issues applying :(,btohqsg
anyone knows now still can use grabpay card to pay income tax?,btohqsg
Any special requirement for branch or any branch will do? Hoping to look for one more accessible in Central region and where the waiting time is not disastrous like waiting outside local bank,btohqsg
I think any branch will do  cause even if I applied online using Singpass myinfo  they still ask me to fill up manual form lol ðŸ˜… I went on Sat early morning  so not much waiting time,btohqsg
For EGA  when is the basic 0.5% interest credited? I called and the CS said it is credited on 24 of every month. Can share your date of crediting interest?,btohqsg

Hi tbills investing using CPFOA  compulsory to leave $20 000 in CPFOA right?,btohqsg
Would Trust bank debit card be better for overseas spending usage or instarem amaze?,btohqsg
With the interest rates coming down  low probability the next EGA promo will be as good as the March oneâ€¦,btohqsg
Acc to Trustâ€™s website  they have no FX fees so im assuming trust would be the better card in this case?,btohqsg
Itâ€™s 0.05%  and yes  24th of the month,btohqsg
It depends on your use case. Watch Chris's video about YouTrip vs Amaze,btohqsg
