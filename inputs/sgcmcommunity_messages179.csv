Remind me of the Borneo agent that told me he sell cars very well that can afford to drive lexus and pay for his family expenses using his income only,btohqsg

Same deal applies for any type of sales,btohqsg
nobody will work sales if a easier full salaried job will pay better,btohqsg
AD wear Rolex. PI wear PP,btohqsg
My PI wear PP and AP,btohqsg
Average mid sized 2nd hand dealer their lot alone at least 7 figures inventory space,btohqsg
Im sure they have a lot of margin,btohqsg

Boss must be hiding RM or more alr,btohqsg

Electric car shock: Ontario man told new battery would cost more than $50 000 |Globalnews.cahttps://globalnews.ca/news/10103753/electric-car-shock-50000-battery/,btohqsg
Ouch. That is too much $50 000.,btohqsg
In 5 years time we can see how much 2nd hand ev worth,btohqsg
Wah tmr temperature as low as 25,btohqsg
It's been a long time sia,btohqsg
Heard last wed 15 Nov was very cold?,btohqsg
I didn't even turn on fan. Open window only. So syiok,btohqsg
I open window and sunroof to drive üòÇü§£,btohqsg
hi guys need some advice...anyone here knows like what kind of things will void hyundai warrenty,btohqsg
cos im thinking of installing ambient lighting but im not sure about the warrenty part,btohqsg
Do not give dealers a reason to void,btohqsg
If never touch the main system  should be fine. Call them and ask. Ambient lighting with Bluetooth control is pretty normal le,btohqsg
What ambient light u refer to? If require dismantle and replacement of the interior of the car  that is questionable,btohqsg
If just add on led light strip  nothing to worry la,btohqsg
like this kind  took this from one of the insta pages i was querying,btohqsg
Anything nt stock is liable to void warranty,btohqsg
the other time i asked a cust rep  he said 3rd party horn also will affect warranty,btohqsg
If it is just paste on. Looks fine. Better call and ask. Need to know how to power the light,btohqsg
Ya la. Because replacing original part ma.,btohqsg
Hi all  riding on the topic of ambient lights  are the cables for ambient lights? I dunno what‚Äôs these in my car. It‚Äôs a second hand. Dealer dunno too,btohqsg
Not sure if it‚Äôs aftermarket ambient lights or just some sound dampening thing. If it‚Äôs the former  I dunno where is the switch lol,btohqsg
I did this to my old car. Even worse  replaced the audi air vent with Mercedes. Technician did say no warranty for body part. But as long as don't touch the main system  audi is alright.,btohqsg
Hope can get some insights üôèüèº,btohqsg
Ya the cable is for the light.,btohqsg
everything just ask back the ad you buy from,btohqsg
General rule is anything not stock is liable,btohqsg
Ya I don‚Äôt mind keeping it but gotta be a way to switch it on lol,btohqsg
Its nt on when engine start?,btohqsg
No leh since the day I took over from dealer,btohqsg
maybe there is a kill switch somewhere?,btohqsg
Ya dealer ask me to see if anything below glove box etc,btohqsg
Ok la he maintained the car quite well. Even the plastic film for the in car entertainment screen nv remove,btohqsg
Really curious how was the light set up. Normally once start the engine  it powers on.,btohqsg
I saw Taobao like some ambient light uses remote control,btohqsg
Maybe need that to power on ü§î,btohqsg
Got chance tube blown or fuse,btohqsg
Ya possibly. But gotta find the fuse box first. Now is no idea where cos the cable will route into the car body,btohqsg
Fusebox near the OBD port at driver side.,btohqsg
could be wired to the DRL  most cars have the DRL on as long as engine is on... if wired to other electrical system may turn off when engine auto stop,btohqsg
Shall go and investigate further tmr,btohqsg
üòúI want to change to new car,btohqsg
Previous quota 924  1165 bids. Close at $95689,btohqsg
If the trend follows w over 1000 bid  then it wil be ard 95k,btohqsg
Depends on last 10 bidders how desperate they want the car,btohqsg
I thought normally end of year have alot of sales? So expected trend should be up,btohqsg
Cat B Quota 648Open Cat 151,btohqsg
Maybe ard 120k to 130k for Cat B n Open,btohqsg
If screw up the electrical area   their warranty will void. Not as simple as people think,btohqsg
Phv companies will buy a lot,btohqsg
dont have that is the problem,btohqsg
my fren went to MG showroom he said dealer offer 150k for EV basic model,btohqsg
< 15k dep where to find,btohqsg
But won't be EV or anything fancy,btohqsg
bro its brand new  has to buy by dec,btohqsg
he said rebates will be reduced,btohqsg
Oh I read your words wrongly  I thought you asking where to find car less than 15k depres,btohqsg
MG company financial ok? I see china got one EV company bankrupt then the existing cars have problems,btohqsg
I see video that the one that is still doing well in china is BYD,btohqsg
the rest of the EV companies is not hitting sales target,btohqsg
haha bro MG is one of the best selling cars in australia,btohqsg
MG's parent company is SAIC Motor (Shanghai Automobile Industry Corporation). SAIC Motor is the 7th largest car manufacturer in the world and was the first automobile group in China with annual sales exceeding 7 million units.,btohqsg
I wld go for Atto 3,btohqsg
All these in troubles r the small manufactures,btohqsg
160k buy EV or 170k buy HRV,btohqsg
Majority here not buying new car. What prize today don't matter,btohqsg
But if its downward trend for few months  2nd hand market will follow also down,btohqsg
It's interesting to see what coe prices today,btohqsg
only for those car that are traded in,btohqsg
those cars traded in high hard to down,btohqsg
unless dealer wanna minimise losses then bring prize down,btohqsg
If the coe 100k suddenly jump down to 30k for good,btohqsg
Just like in the 2000s  where new car cheaper than 2nd hand car because of coe crash  thus dealers needed to sell to minimize loss,btohqsg
hooray after 3 drum please let the squid games begin,btohqsg
Will cat B jump back to 150k?!,btohqsg
this is simi lan lai de,btohqsg
A car dealer I spoke to is expecting cat A to drop,btohqsg
there shall be squid games  sure bounce liao for cat a,btohqsg
Still too many demand but not enough supply,btohqsg
i know its hard i pray for 70k,btohqsg
What you getting if it drop to 70k?,btohqsg
Cos when he buy  his bidding will shoot back,btohqsg
my car will be dec pqp,btohqsg
i tot u r the dealer,btohqsg
Wa  still abit high  last one was 90k,btohqsg
I am the one that kena makan by the dealer üò≠,btohqsg
the boss of 1 car shop at auto centre,btohqsg

Haha if I boss at 1 car shop I won't be here complaining of Coe prices,btohqsg
Admin F  stop posting on FB n jinx the COE can,btohqsg
i just notice cat b already than previous bidding,btohqsg
Cat A keeping ppl in suspense. 15mins left and haven hit quota,btohqsg
Actually is good  last time when it drop also like that,btohqsg
The earlier it break  more likely will exceed the previous bidding,btohqsg
the dealer will play squid game trust me,btohqsg
If like tht... 169k Atto 3  Vantage gg to give hw much disc sia,btohqsg
Buyer buy e car at 120k?,btohqsg
Why not  the price they giving now is quite attractive. If not for charger issue i also considering trying,btohqsg
Once i bid Cat B  i cannot change bid to Open Cat right?,btohqsg
But the price dont want me,btohqsg
Cat A behaving like last bidding,btohqsg
I told my gf  i buy Atto 3 as our 2nd car. Relegate the Stonic to blue label,btohqsg
To change to his Golf R?,btohqsg
Normal golf. But with GOLF R engine hehehe,btohqsg
Maybe shld chion in and ask SE submit one bid for me,btohqsg
Whah cat a bid shooting up,btohqsg
alamak will they void bidding if remain,btohqsg
Cat E still cheaper than cat B?,btohqsg
ok la at least i get better pqp,btohqsg
at least not the ridiculous 100k,btohqsg
But we expected more steep drop,btohqsg
Lol cat E really cheaper than cat B,btohqsg
Haha cat a and b take turn to drop  then up again.,btohqsg
Is it because cat a owner moving to cat b?,btohqsg
Because of previous cat b low prices?,btohqsg
Sorry  I am not so experienced in these coe,btohqsg
Ltr got see Cat A Atto 3 liao,btohqsg
This weekend all chiong. Next COE rebound,btohqsg
1 more month to go for 9% gst,btohqsg
Avoid 9% GST and VES rebate,btohqsg
Most higher end / luxury car is in cat B. When there is a new model usually will push the Coe price alot. Quite number of Hybrid variance also in cat B  so will push the demand even more,btohqsg
c next bidding change new car,btohqsg
When one of the big rental firm exit Singapore and clear their inventory,btohqsg
Wait for erp 2.0 to start,btohqsg
No need to wait till it drops,btohqsg
Erp 2.0 the set is foc ?,btohqsg
Yes free when they ask you to change for the first few months,btohqsg
Mine car still in workshop for repair,btohqsg
Need to drop to 40k or below  and maintain the drop for next 3 months  virtually impossible unless another major financial crisis hits,btohqsg
If we have such financial crisis  I think COE will not be my priority lol. Dunno will kena retrenchment or not,btohqsg
Cat A drop PQP drop i renew liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
I opened my fuse box but don‚Äôt see any button which may look like a switch to my ambient light üòÖ,btohqsg
Still very high  unless no time to wait.,btohqsg
Anyone can recommend which petrol car now for Cat A is worth it??,btohqsg
Seeking some advice  last month I got into an accident with another car which I‚Äôm at fault and already exchanged particulars plus inform my insurer liao. Then just notice recently got a lawyer letter from the other party. Is this the standard procedure? Can I just ignore? Cause they ask to reply within 7 days but when I saw the letter already more than 7 days,btohqsg
Ur insurer will receive a copy too,btohqsg
My testimony. I just made my 182th report. I started reporting with a minimum of one command.,btohqsg
Who buying new car this weekend?,btohqsg
We all have the wish  just lack the genie in a bottle,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt even afford to buy a Wish unless I join the FullLoanSquad,btohqsg
Hi. Anyone interested with car interior design  boleh join WhatsApp group.https://chat.whatsapp.com/JL7aoLMOrQRHYAt6ftWjjI,btohqsg
Imagine u opt for guranteed COE,btohqsg
How does this work? If I bid that time Coe 95k and no drop to 85k I still pay the 95k price?,btohqsg
Afaik  Borneo has no rebates.If coe drop  u ‚Äúlugi‚Äù,btohqsg
So those under the 150k to 110k drop,btohqsg
They will bump the bid to match the COE,btohqsg
U really think dealers will let go of $$$,btohqsg
The price u signed is gg to be the price u pay,btohqsg
U r nt the only buyer,btohqsg
They will offer u COE rebate,btohqsg
eg  car cost 100k  COE they bid 80k  total price 80k  but if COE is 60k when they bid for yours  they earn 20k,btohqsg
Allowing COE to drop  it will eat into their profit,btohqsg
so technically  the pricing they have will always beat COE  unless they hedge wrongly.,btohqsg
So many bidders to make it right,btohqsg
that time i buy car my dealer got do both 2nd hand and new cars  they hedged wrong  i think per car sold COE they lost 3k  cuz customer signed for guaranteed COE,btohqsg
will hedge wrong once in awhile one,btohqsg
COE is like a stock market  its a mind game,btohqsg
Unless everyone bypass AD PI to bid,btohqsg
i rmb is during car show,btohqsg
each car 3k  then all called into meeting,btohqsg
but of course  dealers at certain bidding will earn  certain bidding will lose  offset during the year  whilst making sure they earn > what they lose lo,btohqsg
So to speak  we r at the mercy of AD n PIs,btohqsg
Government invented the game. The players are the AD n PIs,btohqsg
obviously  if u think now if we dun let dealers bid  but let only the person buying bid + COE at full cash  u think who got 100k cash on hand now to really pay up COE,btohqsg
Push the blame to AD n PI,btohqsg
the ultra rich can bah  but middle income abit hard,btohqsg
honestly  who got 150k upfront  maybe CPF have,btohqsg
Only the rich will own cars,btohqsg
no what  if u loan for COE,btohqsg
u can clear car loan meh,btohqsg
aiya COE as they say is a demand and supply issue,btohqsg
the question is supply is controlled..,btohqsg
Sgreans obsession w owning a car,btohqsg
Is mainly the comfort  sometime await grab / taxi damn slow during peak hour,btohqsg
If the weather is bad  sometimes impossible to get also,btohqsg
Even if people willing to pay  sometimes the demand still too many and PHV and taxi cannot supply enough,btohqsg
But the other day i needed to head to a client place,btohqsg
So better to pay for own car  although they pay like twice compared to taking cab / grab everyday  still more convenient,btohqsg
But I opted to ownself drive,btohqsg
The site was too far into Tuas,btohqsg
Can get grab in doesnt mean can get grab out lol,btohqsg
From my hse 46mins  30mins was spent travelling from clementi to Tuas,btohqsg
For work  there is a genuine reason to get a car,btohqsg
Whats the percentage that households need more than 1 car?,btohqsg
How many cars r left in carpark,btohqsg
But u walk into a Landed estate,btohqsg

Lmao exactly this kind of jokers,btohqsg
They bought a 2 3 rm combine into one flat,btohqsg
Spoke to husband in e cp before,btohqsg
Porsche is a COE car. His very first car. Thts y extend coe,btohqsg
Else day to day husband drive Lexus n wife drive BM,btohqsg
They have a condo generating rental,btohqsg
They bought the cars  before covid,btohqsg
So it was relatively cheap by their income standards,btohqsg
But the husband n wife funny. Their 4 cars r nvr near each other,btohqsg
But they r nt the only family w multiple cars at my estate,btohqsg
Mostly is 2 cars. Husband n wife,btohqsg
There is this guy w 3 bikes n 1 car,btohqsg
maybe shud have coe special collector's car,btohqsg
so if u want that car for collector,btohqsg
dont include in COE quota but cap mileage per year,btohqsg
Nb .   Nvr wait for me,btohqsg
Nongsen sia.. nvr wait for me,btohqsg
That's why govt should enforce or shorten the period that dealers are allowed to hold the coe,btohqsg
Maybe should tiak coe from car  car loan up to 7yrs  coe loan up to 10 yrs ü§≠,btohqsg
WP's Jamus Lim pushes for structural COE reforms to curb price fluctuations - Gutzy Asiahttps://gutzy.asia/2023/11/22/wps-jamus-lim-pushes-for-structural-coe-reforms-to-curb-price-fluctuations/,btohqsg
Govt focus is on stabilising coe price  not lowering the coe price ü§≠ most of us wan coe price to drop but sadly that is not on govt's plan,btohqsg
Proposal to reduce or remove involvement of dealer in bidding process.. Dealer gonna cry,btohqsg
Too bad he WP not PAP,btohqsg
Hello everyone  anyone has experience with driving a 2021 Hyundai Avante? Can share review and experience please (not pointing to websites). Thanks much üòÉ,btohqsg
Parts easy n cheap to get,btohqsg
Thks so much. Good to know.,btohqsg
Same with all the other bread and butter korean/japanese sedans lol,btohqsg
Just get a Mazda instead la...,btohqsg
The only worry is pray it wasnt a PHV car w tempered mileage,btohqsg
There's always that risk with any car you buy,btohqsg
Anyway if is a AD unit can check with TEK for servicing records,btohqsg
Same as avante can ask komoco for servicing records. If the dealer don't wanna provide then walk away,btohqsg
Thanks for all the advice. Just looking for a bread/butter car to travel between point A to B. Any Avante drivers out there who can share more about the experience?,btohqsg
i have been looking at roads and don't really notice Avantes,btohqsg
Curious  is the avante better now compared to the 09-14 avante?,btohqsg
I know the old avante engine sucks,btohqsg
So many on the road bro,btohqsg
Its a very nice car to drive as expected from the series.,btohqsg
Elantra AD and MD was a big improvement,btohqsg
My elantra was 2016 it was good,btohqsg
Isnt hyundai bringing in the hybrid model,btohqsg
Since now avante depre also like 14k LOL,btohqsg
doubt it... probably will come out with EV before they bother with hybrid,btohqsg
All dealers   except those from AD  will tamper mileage,btohqsg
don't see her better... usually see her means she scratch the car or something bad,btohqsg
just paid up my insurance renewal,btohqsg
getting up at this point to siam the 9% gst,btohqsg
My uncle had a 06 or was it 07 avante  warned me to avoid it like plague cos the engine kept giving him problems,btohqsg
If the police can abuse the 06/07 Avante w no problem.....,btohqsg
TP still yet to get back from me,btohqsg
Our TP is useless unless someone got hurt,btohqsg
i gonna start spamming their inbox,btohqsg
those cops handling scams are equally useless,btohqsg
went to MP and still can go silent or MIA,btohqsg
"then will say ""oh  change officer liao. write to this xxx instead""  and still nothing happen",btohqsg
Ya agree. My assigned IO didn't reply at all,btohqsg
"the next thing u know ""your case is handled by xxx instead""",btohqsg
then u call or write  like non exist at all,btohqsg
Maybe amount too little... <50 but in principle  a scam is a scam  even 10c,btohqsg
the amount tat was involved for mine  can place a new car deposit liao leh,btohqsg
Ya this also  so many times see commercial vehicle hogging expressway lane 1 the TP ride past never care,btohqsg
And that other video 2 TP behind one hogging car he totally don't care until the 2 TP had to undertake,btohqsg
lorries  vans driving on the first lane also like that,btohqsg
got cctv on every lamp post for what,btohqsg
Like this truck  die die must go lane 2  in the end make the taxi uncle happy only,btohqsg
Lorry dont report. Taxi uncle eat ownself,btohqsg
Comfort nt gg to help uncle chase for injury comp,btohqsg
Not sure about that. Taxi companies very aggressive,btohqsg
Too many foreign drivers for commercial vehicles that drive like back in their country,btohqsg
They have a good legal team to do the claims. I personally know taxi drivers that the other party refuse to report also in the end the taxi driver still get paid holiday,btohqsg
My dad got bang frm behind,btohqsg
They ask my dad pay excess n ask use sue the company or driver to get compensation for the excess n injury,btohqsg
Everyone case is different..cannot assume outcome always the same,btohqsg
I appreciate speeding commercial vehicles on lane 1 more thn normal cars hogging lane 1,btohqsg
True also but they tend to rear end you cos their brakes cannot make it  at least not at that speed with load.,btohqsg
Which company was your dad with?,btohqsg
Actually the lane 2 hoggers would normally be on lane 3 but the lorries move from 4 to 3 so push them to 2,btohqsg
Don't know why SAF have no move timing yet these commercial vehicles that are the same size don't,btohqsg
End up return taxi. And we didnt bother to pay excess,btohqsg
2nd case  got assaulted by pax. Instead  they come chase rental,btohqsg
Sounds like not a good company to work for anyway. What colour?,btohqsg
Until u inform their who's who then the idiots who think they above heaven shake,btohqsg
Still funny to see their senior manager n department head come w fruit basket after we complain to their company's no.1 over lunch,btohqsg
Nice la! Ya don't let them bully your dad,btohqsg
You lucky you know the company's No1 then,btohqsg
Can lorries with those speed limit labels travel on lane 2?,btohqsg
Law not clear except keep left unless overtaking  and slow vehicles keep left  so lorries all go lane 2 and cruise there. Many join expressway already chiong to lane 2 and hog,btohqsg
If battalion mission ex its gna be 60 vehicles in one row bro,btohqsg
We kena before...just 1 tonner also cannot move,btohqsg
I last time do SAF ops stuff during nsf days,btohqsg
So quite strict on the no move time,btohqsg
U pay for business to function?,btohqsg
I know of that perspective also  it's only annoying when they take the right most lane and hog. Then one long tail of cars behind them  all stuck behind a wall. If they truly in a rush then drive faster,btohqsg
Actually if the commercial vehicles don't hog  no one would really care if they are on whatever lane. It's only when their convenience causes others inconvenience then people notice,btohqsg
What is first lane and what is the speed limit,btohqsg
I know you will say that  they hog at 30  speed limit is 50 or 80/90,btohqsg
Hog at 30? Show vid lei,btohqsg
Going to post soon .. too many videos to sort. Just wait,btohqsg
So TP at Lane 1 90kmh. Is he hogging?,btohqsg
90 is the limit it's not,btohqsg
It's when they are obviously way below then I consider hog,btohqsg
Then if a normal passenger car at 90kmh at Lane 1  is he hogging?,btohqsg
What is your problem  no one mentioned going at speed limit right,btohqsg
Throwing red herrings here don't serve any purpose,btohqsg
Now I know why this chat many leaving  because of the toxicity,btohqsg
I have no actual issues w hogging,btohqsg
Lane 2 slow  go lane 3 cut lor,btohqsg
Lane 3 slow  go lane 4 cut lor,btohqsg
Ok next time I show you some videos  I also want to cut and go  all lanes blocked. Even want to consider going to lane 4 and back which is dangerous also cannot,btohqsg
Because of this. So hard to cut and go. I also no time to waste behind them cut and disappear already. If only can,btohqsg
thks for the advice everyone! i really see the usual suspects... Honda  Toyota  Mazda. Got see Hyundai but not the Avante.,btohqsg
Actually it's not the brand but the driver la. Seen enough in the past 20 years driving. They generally are also very inconsiderate people in real life off the roads. Personality doesn't change,btohqsg
what i read so far seems good car to drive,btohqsg
Avante quite a lot on e road. The latest face lift model,btohqsg
i really point A to B driver nia.,btohqsg
thanks much. it would be a nice change for me cos i tried the usual suspects already.,btohqsg
this will be my first korean car,btohqsg
no lah  getting the 2021 Avante,btohqsg
How much n balance how many years,btohqsg
yes i think this is the one,btohqsg
CN7. In the words of SgCarmart  its a will buy,btohqsg

Anyone has got any opinions of buying a 2nd hand Honda insight?,btohqsg
The only concern i have will be the condition of the battery,btohqsg
Dear all. Where is a good recommended place to do regular maintenence and repair of Mercedes C180 around Woodland/Yishun/AMK?,btohqsg
I certify .. wait a minute .. I HAVE NO SKILLS!!! üò©üò©üò©,btohqsg
At the moment a COE cars are falling in place in accordance with the budget.,btohqsg
Not looking for long term drive as well so was just looking at the options  the other car in mind was Polo.,btohqsg
Yes.. its cycle and carriage.. no??,btohqsg
But the fact that it‚Äôs a conti is putting me off. Not sure of the costs at the end of the day especially if repairs come into questions,btohqsg
Vw parts r cheap and easy to get,btohqsg
Just dont get carrot. Got alot stockist,btohqsg
Conti parts are nt as exp as u think they are,btohqsg
Just need to go to the right place and have the patience,btohqsg
1) stockist. The same place most workshop go to to get the parts. Only diff is workshop will mark up and then charge u2) online car parts. Original parts at a fraction of the price u pay in Sg. Including stockist. Downside is shipping n waiting time.3) 2nd hand parts r plenty too. Some r pretty new w mileage.4) OEM parts. Work like original. Tried n tested by many people.5) conti parts frm China. Ultra cheap and affordable. Cos made in China. Conti cars r plenty there. Therefore  many spare parts r manufactured there,btohqsg
1. The insight has about 3 years left and the monthly is cheaper. The dealer is able to give warranty for gearbox and engine  however not for battery. Mileage is very low.2. The polo mileage is much higher at almost 110k but has only got 1 owner. Warranty for 6 months will be for engine and gearbox. The COE is left for 1.5 years roughly. Its interior is well maintained albeit for some wear and tear. Servicing will be done before handover,btohqsg
I highly suspect honda insight mileage is tampered,btohqsg
It's all about risk  whether higher or lower,btohqsg
My dad's 2014 altis nearing end of coe  his mileage 60k only lolz cos he drive to work then back,btohqsg
Since we are on the topic of mileage the insight has a mileage of 48K. The dealer claims the previous owner became bed ridden and couldn‚Äôt drive but yet didn‚Äôt want to sell  the car.,btohqsg
I dun really believe leh  car is damn expensive in sg  just parking in carpark already costs about 50 per day,btohqsg
Please avoid this dealer  the story hard to believe,btohqsg
Left 3 yrs to end of coe,btohqsg
It‚Äôs been renewed COE for 5 year. Registered in 2010,btohqsg
Left with 2 year 11 months thereabouts,btohqsg
Yah agree. Avoid this car  dealer and whole.,btohqsg
Lol my dad super low mileage already 60k and only 9th year,btohqsg
The polo is a lot more straightforward  left with 1 year 6 months. Driven for 110K,btohqsg
Why do u need a car anyway,btohqsg
Go calculate what is the total u will be paying,btohqsg
At the moment  my in law is wheelchair bound so bringing him around mostly and some family outings. That‚Äôs about it,btohqsg
Might drive to Malaysia as and when for shopping needs,btohqsg
If polo I don‚Äôt mind full cash.,btohqsg
The other one will be bank loan.,btohqsg
Insight how much n balance how longPolo how much n balance how long,btohqsg
Insight is 35800  2 years 11 months leftPolo is 19800  1 year 7 months,btohqsg
I think forget the insight  the background of the car is very very dubious,btohqsg
Use the 19k get a proper sedan,btohqsg
If need to put a wheelchair  hatch back not gonna cut it,btohqsg
U need a decent sedan w boot space,btohqsg
I wanted Toyota but the depre so high,btohqsg
I was also considering Elantra with another dealer but he is hell bent on not giving any freebies nor any warranty,btohqsg
I drove fit for sometime  so that guy was able to easily accommodate the needs of my in laws. Hence I looked at polo. Anyway thanks a lot to everyone for all your inputs.,btohqsg
I heard Kia and Elantra cars some is hit or miss. If you get the good one will last long  but if get the terrible one then tend to have many issue,btohqsg
I wanted to get Elantra too at first  but in the end get altis,btohqsg
To be frank  in terms of reliability it‚Äôs going to be Toyota,btohqsg
Now all cars r equally reliable,btohqsg
Toyota u will also vomit blood,btohqsg
But the price very attractive though  I pay the price for Toyota only let me get with lease left 3 years  the same price for the Elantra can get 4 years 6 months lease left,btohqsg
U unlucky  u also get lemon Toyota,btohqsg
I am in the camp that think all 2nd hand car got some problem one  only see acceptable or not haha,btohqsg
After take over  will still need to change some parts one. Wear and tear la  change dash cam la  install new head unit la etc,btohqsg
If previous owner dunno hw to take care  u also suay,btohqsg
Dealer warranty they said give you. It lying to you,btohqsg
Wheelchair bound u cant take hatchback,btohqsg
It's either high risk or low risk   you can go for sgcarmart warranty cars,btohqsg
Hey folks  you all tried sg car quotz before? Can share what‚Äôs your experience‚Äôs like  e.g. paperwork  turnaround time  etc?Dont know if dealers quoting me correctly. ü•∫,btohqsg
If not urgent to sell consign,btohqsg
Mostly yes but not always true‚Ä¶ my fren just sold his Tucson at high 16k dep,btohqsg
Some cars in demand  those the dealers willing to take a smaller hit,btohqsg
From sgcarmart? Don't bother. All lowball ones,btohqsg
Best if you consign or sell yourself,btohqsg
Tall friend ah ‚Ä¶. Reposted IG ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇ,btohqsg
Click on the button to see the chat rules!,btohqsg
Consign even worse. They will use the car to run personal errands,btohqsg
U dun leave ur car there bro,btohqsg
U usually just go there let them take pics,btohqsg
All the time I consign  they have never ask me to leave the car there,btohqsg
Then u continue drivin as per ur usage,btohqsg
Got potential then come set up appt,btohqsg
Some ppl do leave their car w dealer as consignment but mileage is strictly regulated by owner bro,btohqsg
Usually admin fee to buyer + loans comms,btohqsg
Hi guys  just to get some opinion  if I need car use  monthly loan 700  currently drive a cat b hybrid suv  mostly city driving and low usage  and anticipating cat b coe sure high in 2026 when my current coe ends  should I:A. Change to a cat A petrol suv now (monthly 1k to 1.2k); or B. Wait and see? But I think whether I change car in 2026 or renew coe  I expect monthly to go up to beyond 1.2k,btohqsg
you save a lot more driving your current car to the end,btohqsg
hybrid also helps you save more on fuel la,btohqsg
makes no sense to almost double your monthly to downgrade,btohqsg
why fork out DP + top up monthly to downgrade,btohqsg
If u sell current car  i assume u paid 30% or more DP when buying,btohqsg
How much u take back? In cash after clearing loans,btohqsg
And with ur installment so low  i assume u buy when cheap and ur depreciation probably lower than current market also,btohqsg
Cat b hybrid suv for 700  which car in particular?,btohqsg
At this climate how to find that kind of monthly? If change car can easily double the monthly payment,btohqsg
And in 2026 COE guarantee to be more ex? I think have chance for it to drop than for it to increase. Even if it increase  when you sell that time the value will still be good.,btohqsg
If u sell now at market rate how much can u take back?,btohqsg
wah that 21k also not much good,btohqsg
barely enough for DP for next car,btohqsg
No la. Got one PI advert 200+. He add battery n engine together,btohqsg
How much extra u gg to top in addition to 21k,btohqsg
Maybe 233hp for tht 0.1s when u step accelerator,btohqsg
The new car from pi  considering raize petrol 113k or yaris cross petrol  131k  dp flexible but monthly would be about 1.2k lo,btohqsg
don't itchy backside fall for peer pressure and what  not,btohqsg
Stick it out w ur current one,btohqsg
Now where can 700 per month monthly,btohqsg
Okie guys very valuable insight there üëçüëçüëç appreciate very much lolz,btohqsg
Don't get raize lol  I heard that it is underpowered. Yaris cross the FC I heard super good but the space very small  it is basically Vios with crossover body,btohqsg
Lol ok lucky I polled for opinion here,btohqsg
Raize look like mini rav4 but the whole interior full of cheap scratchable plastic  u push any of the panels got creaking noise,btohqsg
Imagine u change and pay double the installment every month for a shittier car,btohqsg
No one here wanna sabo U,btohqsg
Always remember dealers are out to scam u,btohqsg
Yaris cross also really cmi  u alr got hybrid car why bother abt petrol car fc,btohqsg
if corolla cross for that price maybe can consider,btohqsg
Underused lo  but yah I agree too,btohqsg
For hybrid to change to petrol  if cheaper ofc take it if underused,btohqsg
But ur hybrid cheap u want change to more exp petrol car,btohqsg
If wallet itchy better spend elsewhere,btohqsg
Cos I was considering 2 yrs later my monthly sure up up,btohqsg
Dont buy depreciating  things based on future projections,btohqsg
U also need consider the cost diff between u pay 2 extra years of more expensive installment,btohqsg
yea so u are asking to just suck thumb and pay the 1.2k for 2 extra years  rather than risk paying 1.3k a month after,btohqsg
Unless it becomes 1.7k or smth after,btohqsg
U overall pay more if u change now,btohqsg
Maybe coe can drop or rise,btohqsg
My office colleague uncles telling me that in 2024 - 2025 (near election period)  the Coe quota will magically increase and price will drop,btohqsg
@rxconzv2Drift King DK is a smart man,btohqsg
Dunno how true  but they lao jiao maybe can see the futufe,btohqsg
either way  u see it for urself then say,btohqsg
If drop can buy  if not just hold no harm also,btohqsg
But in general the 4-5 years in the decade (2014-2015 2004-2005) have been known to have more quota,btohqsg
So we will see if the trend continues,btohqsg
It is like watching Taiwanese soap opera,btohqsg
same as reading opposition / complaint singapore fb group  stuff to read while on the toilet,btohqsg
Whatever happens  there will always be a theory which emerges,btohqsg
U can laugh at all the auntie uncles,btohqsg
Eh.. when it happens  I will clap and be happy for them!!!,btohqsg
Maybe next year PAP lose? The Jamus remove COE. Then car super cheap,btohqsg
PE2023 has shown that it will never happen,btohqsg
Then U only see me driving at night,btohqsg
No need for mobile speed camera liao,btohqsg
Uncles take without thinking. They alrdy took COE for the next few years to top up this year,btohqsg
So can expect lesser coe in time to come,btohqsg
Dun think they will remove COE,btohqsg
2 lane road  4 vehicles can pass through,btohqsg
It will never happen. Whoever is the government of the day  they will not touch the COE,btohqsg
No leh ; spare part needs to ship in from oversea,btohqsg
Thinking out of the box. Country benefits!!! üëçüèº,btohqsg
