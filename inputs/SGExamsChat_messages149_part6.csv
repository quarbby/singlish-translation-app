In Chinese sites  you can copy stuff from others without referencing and just claim that it is yours,btohqsg
Oh so the authors can express themselves more freely?,btohqsg
In most stuff yes  without bothering about copyright. You can just take music off somewhere for free and use it,btohqsg
How does that link to the depth n substance of the article content then? Haha,btohqsg
If you write something sensitive it may go through manual processing first,btohqsg
But chinese articles r harder to read. I take longer to catch the content,btohqsg
If you have access to more content without permission  for free  your content will be more in depth,btohqsg
And chinese people are less critical about articles,btohqsg
So people feel more at ease making certain claims  even if it may be false,btohqsg
Once you are used it should be faster  but hardly anyone really fluent in both languages is going to read Chinese faster. The characters take longer to process,btohqsg
This is what you might see if they want to manually check that your article is free from sensitive content,btohqsg
The pitiful must have something to hate  and those that hate must have misery.Or something like that. Google translate and then touch up by me,btohqsg
Is it if a person is in a pitiful state  there must be a reason behind it,btohqsg
The second part i dun fully get it yet,btohqsg
So ppl who hate them have misery?,btohqsg
I mean those that are hated,btohqsg
What are you all chatting abt?,btohqsg
lol meanwhile im in misery over my CA Mod results,btohqsg
If only Mulan was in Chinese,btohqsg
A lot of the nuance was lost because they tried to pander to a Western audience,btohqsg
I watch mu lan cus the girl look quite good but other than that meh,btohqsg
Hahah there is sth hate?? Hahaha i anyhow apply one,btohqsg
Uh u not the first person,btohqsg
To begin with i seldom watch movie,btohqsg
I rather read synopsis and analysis critics etc,btohqsg
It's original but only because they remove so many parts of mulan,btohqsg
like the small dragon guy gone,btohqsg
Ya she was dating a korean star,btohqsg
Ya she beautiful r wuhan ladies all like that??,btohqsg
There is yangmi very pretty too,btohqsg
not being thirsty but just look,btohqsg
they look like bombs but they are average in their nation according to locals,btohqsg
lmao it just became a simp convo,btohqsg
Ya their blue eyes n fair skin,btohqsg
if you look at the girls are the other side of the world their average is so good,btohqsg
But hey they may find asians pretty too,btohqsg
Caucasians say asian features sharp n delicate,btohqsg
So i think exotic is beautiful,btohqsg
The grass is always more exotic on the other side,btohqsg
If you like food and travelling and reading Chinese articles  I recommend 穷游网,btohqsg
idk if I should be saying this but some of them like asians for the wrong reason,btohqsg
This is not written by me though,btohqsg
Not really  but if I travel to other countries I don't mind collecting some,btohqsg
It's for nsfw reasons and because of what they watch.,btohqsg
R u still studying? And where which country?,btohqsg
why the uni students here so free haha,btohqsg
is it the mod bell curve not so steep,btohqsg
i not joking  mine is rly steep,btohqsg
I had to google it as well. Something like not safe for work,btohqsg
Don't know what that really means,btohqsg
