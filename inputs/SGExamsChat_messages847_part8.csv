üò≠ wdym all points were related to climate,btohqsg
not sure if that's how you talk to your frens too but why wld you speak 30 min straight to them,btohqsg
i might've fallen asleep listening to you drone on and on,btohqsg
idk i just have a lot to say abt climate change,btohqsg
hahahaha  i hope the examiners were impressed with you,btohqsg
did you score well overall for english?,btohqsg
for prelims i got 25 for oral,btohqsg
what were the compo topics btw? just curious,btohqsg
üò≠ i think im gna fail o‚Äôs tho,btohqsg
ig bcuz the examiners had to tell you to stop  you must lower your expectations in that aspect,btohqsg
unless god works up sm miracle,btohqsg
same topic for compo as oral?,btohqsg
they were like ‚Äúokay thats all we need u may go‚Äù,btohqsg
do you have the whole qn,btohqsg
idk all ik is the bellcurve high,btohqsg
if everyone who thought they're gonna fail actually fails,btohqsg
i actually do think im gna fail,btohqsg
i think i hv to go sec5 leh,btohqsg
i think you might not fail everything  perhaps just oral,btohqsg
oh whatever atleast i wont be put in the gangster class,btohqsg
got 12 ppl in sec5 in my sch,btohqsg
Cus you over-presented and the examiners have more ppl to examine. When you do that  you affect their moods to be more negative,btohqsg
Which increases your probability of failing,btohqsg
üò≠ also if you mark based on emotions,btohqsg
Cus both examiners will be pissed off,btohqsg
that just reduces the legitimacy of the exam,btohqsg
i mean if you step in the shoes of the examiner what wld you feel?,btohqsg
girl idt ppl mark based on emotions,btohqsg
inherently thats just a wrong way of marking,btohqsg
i mean that's why there's a certain limit to the number of words ideally for compo as well,btohqsg
um cambridge is a very prestigious and internationally renowned academic institution,btohqsg
yep  but if someone really spoke for that long in a supposed 15 minute oral I would really want them to get over with it,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt think they mark on emotions,btohqsg
i'm sad to disappoint you that your oral examiners aren't from cambridge,btohqsg
is it like the mt one,btohqsg
You can pay up $50 to ask for the SEAB to look through  but they won't show you the marks,btohqsg
anyways i hope you pass sincerely,btohqsg
cus you sound like you studied a lot for it,btohqsg
or i do coin toss and let it decide,btohqsg
o levels in sec 4 then retake again in sec 5? or what?,btohqsg
sorry i don;t get it cus my sec sch was all o level,btohqsg
they put the retakers in sec5 class,btohqsg
but i hv to appeal to the sch,btohqsg
which in it of itself is a tedious process already,btohqsg
i could go to ite mechanical engine and js like do well to skip a yr of poly,btohqsg
depends on your progress :- if you really dislike the academic curriculum  ITE would be hands-on and practical-based so you would enjoy being there instead- if you are able to go to any poly course  just go for it and avoid going ITE cus nitec is lower qualification as compared to diploma level- if you really did badly but you felt it was cus you didn't put in effort (which I doubt applies to you) or you had major distractions  perhaps retaking O level (either all OR for certain subjects) might benefit you,btohqsg
idk if i fit in ite tho.. like i dont vape and shi,btohqsg
im gonna get jumped on my first day,btohqsg
oh its not nitec its higher nitec,btohqsg
also its 2 years compared to the NA 3 years,btohqsg
