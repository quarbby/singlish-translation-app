U foreigner right? I think they will just write off $800 as bad debt. Sue u not worth the hassle,btohqsg
Can you show us the invoice let us see the damage you had to pay,btohqsg
that's another thing i don't get after seeing the terms and conditions here.. i feel like they're just trying to rip me off and hope that i just pay and shut up,btohqsg
U can don’t pay. It’s not against the law,btohqsg
they want me to pay clean up fees of $800.. 300 for the first rental and 500 for the second,btohqsg
You should try smoking in the MRT or bus too.,btohqsg

Maybe in the cab going back to the airport,btohqsg

If cannot obey rules better don't rent get go...,btohqsg
I think this 1 small problem,btohqsg
U have not seen bigger problems like car n driver missing  car Sold in msia   car used for drugs etc,btohqsg
I think getgo should count their blessings that u even tried to return the car to them intact. Quite funny they actually tried to chase u for smoking fee,btohqsg
U should just magically disappear with the car lol,btohqsg

HiIs there any aircon workshop tmr  need to top up gas,btohqsg
Only 1 branch left at amk  yishun closed down,btohqsg
hi guys is it recommended to get guaranteed or non guaranteed coe? or what would affect which is better? lets say maybe i am not super urgent to get?,btohqsg
Recommended to not get car and just take public transport,btohqsg
Don't need guaranteed bid if u are not urgent,btohqsg
If u are lucky u can still get first try,btohqsg
Either u put in same bid as last bid or bid higher than last bid,btohqsg
i see  so best is non guaranteed  without topup? hahah,btohqsg
Probably. If u are really really keen to get the car asap and are okay to pay additional  then guaranteed bid. Otherwise non guaranteed is okay as well though there's a chance it takes longer time,btohqsg
okay thanks so much for your ans :),btohqsg
