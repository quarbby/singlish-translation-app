Abit cringe to me tho lol,btohqsg

A lot of times it‚Äôs due to nerves.. but driving in the open road also require u to be calm. All I can say is if u fail then it means u are not ready for the real thing and that might be a good thing. Just have to calm ur mind and practice more,btohqsg
Not likely  they grade you on your driving.. not your assets or figure.,btohqsg
Who knows.. maybe you in closet üòèüòù,btohqsg
Same reason still. Means u not ready. And that will be safer for u and other road users that they not pass u first. I also only passed third attempt (class 3) and initially I was also salty  until I passed on the third and realised it was a good thing,btohqsg
sure i think i should just go for more revision,btohqsg
Yup. I know it‚Äôs frustrating. But don‚Äôt give up! And I think my advice is the more u want to pass  the more prsssure u give yrself and the more u will make mistake,btohqsg
