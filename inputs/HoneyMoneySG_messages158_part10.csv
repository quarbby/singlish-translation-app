@ChrisHMSGhow about a review video for sim only plans? üòÑ,btohqsg
Has anyone successfully paid tax and car loans with cardup paired with DCS Ultimate 2% cashback ?,btohqsg
POEMS - when investing using SRS/CPFOA - I need to have the exact amount of cash in the account before I can trade ? Seems like a requirement,btohqsg
how is the coverage? like in lifts/mrt/underground. just went to see the plans seem quite attractive also,btohqsg
now with amaze out of the picture  are you guys replacing citi rewards with dbs world woman master?,btohqsg
can still use citi rewards directly for online,btohqsg
coz now I have both  deciding to cancel one.. considering to get uob ppv and lady's to replace amaze+citi,btohqsg
leaning towards dbs since it supports atome  meanwhile seems like citi reward has some exclusion on the merchants,btohqsg
Hi am wondering if anyone is facing issue using the chocolate Visa debit card?A few times I tried using it to take the mrt and it says card failed. But then the money is still deducted from my account. Tried contacting chocolate WA and no response.,btohqsg
seems like under $5 will just use those generic cashback card due to the $5 block,btohqsg
Both have pros and cons. Dbs only valid one year but can use for travel. Citi can last 5 years but cannot use for travel.,btohqsg
yup  so hard to pick yet doesnt make sense to keep both haha,btohqsg
I find one year validity is too short and I don‚Äôt travel frequently so I prefer Citi. Atome works for Citi.,btohqsg
I would keep both  use for different purpose,btohqsg
i dont spend that much to keep both  need to strategise haha.. unless annual fee always waive successfully,btohqsg
Check your past one year online spending see it‚Äôs worth keeping both or not.,btohqsg
JJ01:Just asking. Did anyone use ibkr traderworkstation[tws] to exchange currency. [I mean FXCONV at the advanced tab]Now at the advanced tab only left idealpro. Want to know is it my issue. Or ibkr make changes only able to make fx change at their ibkr website.,btohqsg

Hello morning  can I check for simplygo rides  is it better to use CF or ppv card?,btohqsg

Hello guys  which card is good for flight tickets? estimated $3k+,btohqsg
if u don‚Äôt have the cash balance how u gonna trade?,btohqsg
Not deduct funds from CPF / SRS ?,btohqsg
Hi  wanted to check has anyone received withdrawals on chocolate finance ?,btohqsg
These kind of comparisons do not move the needle (in FI). Just get one that gives you the least problemsEdit for context. I'm using ZYM  wife using eight. Both are working fine and affordable plans,btohqsg
Btw  for those who cant apply uob stuff online (get prompted to go down to branch after singpass details)  try through their website (Help & support > Forms > what u are applying)‚Ä¶Went down to branch try and apply ppv  physical form didnt have ppv  then got told by card specialist no longer issuing which i was sure isnt the case,btohqsg
For SRS/CPF orders- stocks/ETFs  need the corresponding cash amount- Unit trusts e.g. Amundi  no need,btohqsg
Hi all! For UOB PRVI  i have sent ‚ÄúPMAF **** ‚Äú (last 4 digit NRIC).What am i suppose to do next?Wait for the AF $240 to auto charge or do i have to pay the AF $240 manuallu?,btohqsg
wait for AF to charge first,btohqsg
Thanks! Do you know approx when will AF be charged?,btohqsg
quite long from what i remembered  should be 2-3 months after card approved,btohqsg
its good in most places! not perfect but thats about the same compared to other sim only plans ive tried.also  lifts are a faraday cage so i dont think you can ever expect a decent signal in there,btohqsg
Initiated on Tuesday (11/3) evening but still no news yet,btohqsg
how much and when ah  i initiated one monday 1pm around 50k but no updates. whatsapp also no replies,btohqsg
I requested on Monday noon until now still no news.,btohqsg
Mine 10k. I think doesn‚Äôt matter how much? I have seen ppl requested for 20k+ but received already,btohqsg
same as well  saw a reddit post. not sure how their withdrawal system works,btohqsg
PPV only reward you with 0.4 mpd. CF may encounter technical issue at gantry. For better travel experience  use other card.,btohqsg
For this Fund & Trade promotion  can the funding be from SRS/ CPF OA or must it be cash?,btohqsg
i tried myrepublic it was damn bad so i switched back to zymüòê,btohqsg
i faced the same problem  still waiting for them to process with my application,btohqsg
What other cc do u recommend,btohqsg
I am new to uob lady and I have selected travel as my category. I have made some transactions but in my rewards could only see 1 uni$ for each $5 block. May I know if the bonus uni$ are credited later?,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  I have used your referral to sign up for poems. If I bought amundi using srs  may I know if it will be deducted automatically from my srs account?,btohqsg
Bonus miles for qualified trnx will be credited begining of next month.,btohqsg
Yes  if you have already linked the SRS account to POEMS in your account settings,btohqsg
I withdrew on the 10th at 1030am. they‚Äôve not even sold the holdings yet. Hopefully  tomorrow.,btohqsg
