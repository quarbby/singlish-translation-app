to have higher interest rates mah… hahaha,btohqsg
just don't credit to uob since can bank transfer for the interest,btohqsg
Technically Dbs is the lousiest bank to credit salary to.Because you only get it at 12am. While for some foreign banks and local banks  you get your salary one day earlier at 5pm.,btohqsg
And yes this matters if you can deploy your salary or bonus one day earlier (could be 3 days earlier if cross weekend).,btohqsg
Nope. Where to find this account tracker?,btohqsg
Woah u use wat card?? AMEX platinum ah?,btohqsg
How about UOB? I used to get at 3.00am-6.00am 8-10 years ago  while OCBC/DBS around 10pm to midnight  heard this from colleagues.,btohqsg
i came across stand chart jumpstart acc and e$aver acc with both competitive int rates. wondering if anyone in this grp utilizes those accounts?,btohqsg
I still keep my jump-start even though I'm much older than the cut off age. It's the only acc that I know with 2% interest which haven't rotiprata over the past 5y+,btohqsg
so its good to deposit savings inside right? since im going to start working and dont have much cash savings for now,btohqsg
Fuss free no hoops no minimum balance no minimum spend,btohqsg

Hi any idea promo still valid if after shares transfer into Webull  sold the shares and use the funds to buy other shares? Basically never withdraw the funds,btohqsg
If miles team then yup  if exchange rate team then maybe wise/youtrip/ichange/revolut/amaze wallet might be better,btohqsg
What you plan to spend on?How much you plan to spend?If you plan to buy LV bag  Rolex watch or pay hotel  definitely no.,btohqsg
Is this up to 3k or 3k,btohqsg
What are some platform you guys using for crypto trading ?,btohqsg

If someone has more than a million in investments they are unlikely to be willing to plonk it into a platform like webull.,btohqsg

Hi all  just joined the group here. Am in mid 40s  and have not set up SRS acc  is it too late to do now to take advantage of the Tax incentives?,btohqsg
uob lady cc don't have a minimum spending fyi,btohqsg
Never too late. Actually srs shouldn't start so early.  My take,btohqsg
Oh i meant for the fulfillment ofthe uob one account interest,btohqsg
Most impt  do not let the money just sit in the bank,btohqsg
IMO  it’s never late to setup SRS and get tax relief,btohqsg
Another question  which do you think is the best credit cards to earn miles with local spending ?,btohqsg
depends on what u are spending on and how much is your estimated spending per month. All cards are good when defined and used correctly,btohqsg
I read there are others who got this? I believe as long as u don’t click it. It’s all safe still.,btohqsg
Any expert knows if I pay for drink or food using ShopBack + Revolution… can I still earn 4Mpd for Revolution card?,btohqsg

I’ve dialled in yesterday to their fraud team and informed them about it. They recommend getting a new card.,btohqsg
Yeah they sure will recommend that to play safe.But my thinking (open to discussion) is since 3DS blocked it. Still safe and I can keep the card intact.Reporting and replacing card damn troublesome. Must re setup a lot of things.Also I have 5 Citi cards. I can’t tell which one kenna.,btohqsg
Yup i got one yesterday too,btohqsg
They already know ur card number lol better change it.,btohqsg
Some transactions dont need 3DS to go through one,btohqsg
So once they try that  u may be screwed,btohqsg
The issue is with mulitple citi card u dont know which one is the one so have to wait and see. I got fraud transaction just last month with this citi 3ds  just replace then now again. Think citi is been targeted,btohqsg
Last wave was UOB. Now Citi?,btohqsg
Just call and ask citi which card lor they will know,btohqsg
Coz i kena before also with another bank  i ignore the 3ds  the next day  the frausters put another transaction through without verification,btohqsg
