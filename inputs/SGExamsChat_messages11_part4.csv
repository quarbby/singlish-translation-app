The problem is that then they won't really really serve reservist  since their gahment rank is typically higher after they get out.Or even if they do serve reservist  wouldn't it be super weird,btohqsg
lets turn this army chat political,btohqsg
but the scholarship isn't government funded,btohqsg
Mono has very weird dynamics I feel,btohqsg
We have ite poly and jc  as well as 90rp scholars,btohqsg

For this mono thing  it's still going to be a small minority ba. The situation where scholars mix with the middle and lower class is rare  mostly only occurring in the support company,btohqsg
