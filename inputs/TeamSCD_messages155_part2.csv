Red car black wing can understand... But black car red wing,btohqsg
Honestly rather than spend a couple hundred spray the wing black  just buy a used GT wing,btohqsg
Used CF voltex rep easily $200 or less,btohqsg
Happened to my friend before. He squeeze  then the other guy dowan give way  end up sideswipe a bit.,btohqsg
The guy come down from the car wanna fight  my friend come down with spanner,btohqsg
the guy's father just say nvm let him pass.,btohqsg
the driver was just some YP with the family going into JB,btohqsg
then YP dont wanna let ppl cut,btohqsg
moral of the story always keep spanner in car when going jb ? üòÇ,btohqsg
in case kena rob also can whack back,btohqsg
But sometimes i dont understand why drivers don't wanna give way to ppl,btohqsg
I give way let you in  at most ltr i overtake you back nia,btohqsg
1 car also cannot overtake meh,btohqsg
Depends. If merging like normal or multiple queue line scenario its fine,btohqsg
Those chiong lorry lane and then want to cut queue one  i will block as though im paid to do it,btohqsg
ya this one fucking annoying bro,btohqsg
sometimes jam like fuck Q 2 hours alr some one just wanna cut in very busy song üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Which idiot cannot see the lorry lane is empty,btohqsg
We dont do it because if we all do it then lorry how,btohqsg
Just imagine is done to u. Actually car lane clear but lorries dont want to queue and use car lane,btohqsg
Then u for no reason 2 hour jam instead of 5 min clear,btohqsg
It happens at tuas side sometimes,btohqsg
some people just selfish lor  want to faster clear jam at the expense of everyone else,btohqsg
i wouldn't risk my car and just let 1 car pass. Or if you can't win them  join them,btohqsg
i got 1 friend always block cars from cutting in one hahaha then he always like to say  i no scare kena scratch,btohqsg
This one really ego issue. LOL,btohqsg
That's why this kind of accidents will happen. both also not scared kena scratch  then really bang already  come down start to fight,btohqsg
Same as my friend's incident. He cut ppl he also not scared kena scratch one.,btohqsg
wanna fight also take spanner nia. Hahahah,btohqsg
curious ah.. how do you determine the pricing,btohqsg
Base on lighting equipment usage  what kind of lens needed to be use etc alot of Kind,btohqsg
but for that pricing the photos are abit questionable,btohqsg
Just take a look at market rate will do.,btohqsg
That was my first tot. But then he say he gonna change. So okay lor,btohqsg
Market rate we are talking at least 300-500 for short and changing per hour.,btohqsg
My is a fixed rate  for the whole session  even if I take 10 hours still the fixed rate,btohqsg
but the photos don't match what the market show leh.. just my opinion,btohqsg
yes i do so as well,btohqsg
No wonder i was wondering why u were juding him,btohqsg
You don't agree with his pricing can don't find him only,btohqsg
Relax la everybody got their own pricingüëç and the way they shootüëç,btohqsg
I don't know why you have to voice out your opinion,btohqsg
You won't like it if someone starts saying the rates you charge at is too high,btohqsg
Walao don't need to shoot him la  if he wanna voice just say only. I'm not angry or anything lor.,btohqsg
And from what you're implying it also sounds like you're saying his photos aren't good enough,btohqsg
for the price he is charging,btohqsg
nono haha his photos are quite nice honestly,btohqsg
Then what do you mean by photos don't match what the market shows,btohqsg
