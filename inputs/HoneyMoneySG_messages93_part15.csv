If lets say I go to JB with my GF and want to help her pay for her beauty appointment. Would I save more by using my- UOB ONE CCCashback3.25% foreign transaction feeWorse exchange rateCan contribute to min spending for cashbackOR- Revolut?Better exchange rateLower foreign transaction fee?,btohqsg
I think if it‚Äôs for the purpose of contributing to min. SpendI‚Äôm sure that there are better ways to clock it instead of using it in JB. Maybe UOB One is not so suitable for your use case,btohqsg
Did anyone tried to claim anything after buying seedly travel insurance? Any feedback?,btohqsg
if you go malaysia and spend in MYR  the best card you should be using is Maybank family and friends for 8% cashback on MYR spending.,btohqsg
Hmm I don't have a maybank card. I do go JB once a month though  perhaps thats a good enough incentive to get it for the cashback.@Alanthats true. Then in this case if I'm strictly comparing just these two cards then I suppose revolut is the better option if I can hit my min spending on UOB ONE cc elsewhere?,btohqsg
Yes  If going in JB often enough  then maybe should ‚Äúinvest‚Äù in maybe like trust card or something that has good exchange rate or something.,btohqsg
Hi all  can i buy $1000 of amazon voucher using Max which have MCC code of 5311 to be eligible for this promo?,btohqsg
UNI$ based on posted transactions in calendar month  unless your statement date is close to 31st  1st of the month  both numbers will be different.,btohqsg
Or some of the categories you think it is counted  but it is not. Hence not equate when you calculated.,btohqsg

UOB EVOL better for higher cashback of 6.67%. UOB One usually for families with their ACB merchants   IMO.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs also fulfills your $500 minimum spend on UOB One Acct Bonus Interest. Good CB for public transport under mobile transactions.,btohqsg
Hi all  this is my first time using cardup. Thinking to use the ocbc promo of 1.5% fee for a payment of 16k (buying a second hand motor). But the shop said they only accept paynow or cash. Does that mean I can't use cardup? Or I can ask them for their bank account  and I just use cardup to pay them?,btohqsg
Hi guys  i just graduated and i applied for the OCBC 360 account. I know that i have to use a OCBC credit card if i want the extra 0.6% additional interest. But which credit card should i get to maximise mile? OCBC 90N?,btohqsg
Alot people don't get this ocbc 90N cos they said the earn mile per dollar is low. I got it cos I don't want to go for citi rewards mastercard with amaze that gives 4mpd for eligible spend. I get this ocbc 90n as the backup card. What I like the miles is never expires but not sure ocbc will change the tnc in the future. Just my thoughts. What card u like depends on ur lifestyle and personal preference really,btohqsg
I see.. but would you go for the OCBC rewards over the 90N? I understand it has to be a OCBC credit card üòÇ sorry very new to this hahaha,btohqsg
i found that Amaze card can‚Äôt be linked to apple pay. I wonder if there are alternatives? Should i use Youtrip or wise?I wanted to use apple pay overseas,btohqsg
Sorry ocbc rewards means the 0.6% bonus spend interest for ocbc 360 account?,btohqsg
Erm its the OCBC rewards card  previously I think it was called the titanium rewards card,btohqsg
I don't have cos it doesn't suit my lifestyle and preference :(,btohqsg
Ahhh icic okay! Thanks for your help! üòÑ,btohqsg
If you don't mind  can switch to uob one acct  there have better cc for miles accumulation,btohqsg
got more explaination on this ? cause this will be my first health insurance,btohqsg
Do you earn crmc 10 points by making grab paylater repayments using amaze+crmc?,btohqsg
There are some things you can look up to find out:1. Group vs Personal policies2. MINDEF/MHA Group Term vs SingLife Elite TermAn over-simplified version is this:1. Group policies do not belong to you  the method of payout upon death are different  there's policy change risk. Personal policies belong to you  usually have higher upfront premiums compared to their group policies equivalent  but you can be sure that what you buy is what it will be until it's surrendered.2. MINDEF/MHA Group Term is very cheap till 64  but becomes over 10x more from 65 onwards. Singlife Elite Term is the personal equivalent of MINDEF/MHA Group Term  you can cover as old as they allow you  the older it is the more expensive the premium  but like all personal policies  you earlier you start the cheaper it is and the amount won't change until surrender.Anything else can refer to your insurance agent if you have one  or look for a trusted one.,btohqsg
but wont personal policy also increase as you age ?,btohqsg
What you buy is what it will be until it's surrendered.,btohqsg
Group term gets reviewed every 4 years or as and when they want to. Personal term don't.,btohqsg
Ocbc reward card is also ok can topup unity for the FairPrice voucher card for 4mpd plus the 0.6% interest.,btohqsg
Hi Chris abit confused;BHS cap is supposed to be by age level?But you currently hit it at max BHS. Following by current cohort of $71 500 (age 65) for 2024?Then interest flow to SA (assuming not maxed to FRS at $205 800 (age 55)?So the Medisave will not be more than $71500 in 2024; even though you are not at age 65 yet?,btohqsg
Hi all  regarding OCBC 360 spend bonus interest. If i have a transaction from Feb that will be refunded in Mar  will this reduce my total spend in Feb or Mar ?,btohqsg
Because you have lesser day in Feb.,btohqsg
Guys  whats the mpd bonus for uob lady's card after $1000 spending? Is it just 0.4mpd?And if I pay travel using Atome  will it be considered as online purchase?,btohqsg
Hi  I intend to buy a laptop from challenger.  Which cc is best for the installment? Uob one? Hsbc revolution?,btohqsg
BHS will increase yearly but fixed at 65 years old. Same concept as FRS will increase yearly but fixed at 55 years old.Difference is if MA hit BHS  any contributions to MA will go to SA if SA haven't hit FRS or go to OA if SA have hit FRS  while contributions to SA after SA hit FRS will continue to be in SA.,btohqsg
The latest video; he show 3 new hacks  but the first one shows that his MA transfer to OA.But currently not age 65 Why is that so ah?,btohqsg
Because MA cannot go above BHS  while SA can go above FRS,btohqsg
Atome is not under Lady travel. You will not  earn 6mpd from Lady.,btohqsg
I see. So is better to pay full  so at least got some rebate right?,btohqsg
If I pay with atome+citirewards or amaze combo  will I get 4mpd?,btohqsg
yes. Can use kris+ charged to dbs wwmc for 4mpd on $1.5k  or use uob kf cc for 3mpd unlimited,btohqsg
Hsbc ega bonus int just in for me,btohqsg
Will kris+ cdg taxi using amaze linked to Citi rewards cars get me the 4mpd from citi rewards online transaction?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword‚ÄúCiti rewards atome‚Äù‚ÄúCiti rewards travel‚Äùto search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
