Those idiots are the ones where lane 2 empty and people keep overtaking at lane 2 and he still duwan move,btohqsg
And then when u overtake at lane2 u look inside e driver.. usually some kokster. Look straight and dont know whats going on kind  both hands at 11 and 1o clock on steering wheel.,btohqsg

Ok la be safe   but 70-80 on expressway is like crawling also,btohqsg
I think 100 on eway is reasonable speed tbh,btohqsg
70-80 is really too slow. Especially at night  i think the probability of driver falling asleep is higher,btohqsg
Haha ya too slow that can‚Äôt pay full attention on road,btohqsg
Agree man. If heavier traffic then 80-100 is ok.,btohqsg
