I had a grabfood acct under bicycle  cant change to car. ask me go take pdvl........,btohqsg
My friends doing gojek earn $500nett today,btohqsg

I was thinking of taking pdvl. met a LLM rider one day taking order. he said  he one day use car then change to bike alrdy. use car very diff parking for him. he suggested to me to use car for passengers  better,btohqsg

Rental car cannot do rydes FYI,btohqsg

I signed up. Haven't got to try it yet but I do hear the $ is good though.You will have like a block timing(something like shift) kr smth like that. Go to their warehouse  drive into the warehouse  stop right infront of your packages  collect your packages  and off you go to deliver. Just like that,btohqsg
But they only have 1 or 2 warehouse if I remembered correctly. It's in Jurong East,btohqsg

Does rydes take commission ? Anyway the value of a ryde flash or ryde pool trip seems to be kinda low,btohqsg
But it is good to do combination if rydes n llm,btohqsg
Jb no open? Wan pa you buy grocery leh,btohqsg
LLM can stack aready tau chio. Still wan stack rydeü§£,btohqsg
How to find our referral code?,btohqsg
Hi anyone here work llm using motorcycle? How was it..better than panda  grab express etc?,btohqsg
Do you like jobs being pushed to you or like to pull jobs you can choose?,btohqsg
Yeah  but fastest finger first and need to be patience to snatch job from others. This is how LLM works.,btohqsg
I have a friend working for grabexpress/grabmart and honestly  I think they earn better than LLM,btohqsg
"This is one LHL mentioned before. ""Steal ur lunch.""",btohqsg
Woodlands dark sky.. Be safe guys‚úåÔ∏è,btohqsg
Everyday got pple askg can earn or not  which 1 earn more. Nvr ending,btohqsg
Actually work full-time for delivery company or Mcd/Pizza Hut earns more,btohqsg
Earn More = Fixed Time + More Hours + Staff Benefits + CPFEarn Less = Flexible Time + Lesser Hours - Staff Benefits - CPF,btohqsg
"Good is ""Covered"". Bad is those benefits need to pay a price. As in income will be lower.Freelance good is earn everything under the sun. Bad is no minimal coverage.",btohqsg
No worries LHL had spoken . Going to help lower wage worker. Food deliverer included... Pay rise soon,btohqsg
"His ""Help"" mean lower the earnings. Cos he don't want to see ""Spoilers"" go around say drive or deliver this platform can get $3k or $4k or even more. This disrupt the actual demand and supply in the workforce.",btohqsg
Dun be so pessimistic leh broü§£,btohqsg
My company got wage adjustment for lower wage worker starting from next month wor,btohqsg
Hope I am wrong. But he is a petty person. Imagine ur pay $7k by doing just LLM alone. That already twist his long term plan of getting potential overseas investors to setup operations / factory here. But then  that is those on ivory tower point of view.In employer  who doesn't want to employ cheaper  better and faster workers ? Of course  foreigners. Those what raise wages for S-Pass or whatever sh1t  can be amended. In the end  we still lose out. $2k or $2.5k jobs with benefits. Take it or leave it. Else  become a FL or sell backside.,btohqsg
Just believe him once n last time lor. If cheated your feeling next erection go fulfill your duty as citizen loü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Like that need migrate liaoü§£ü§£. Save up go Vietnam be kingü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Then again.. If both parents here  u want to migrate ?,btohqsg
After they go west sky lor,btohqsg
By then yr child aso big liao,btohqsg
I guess we all have friends whose other partner is not local. When the time comes  they will just migrate away.,btohqsg
Rent out HDB here south East Asia a lot countries n gals welcome u,btohqsg
Alot ... Alot ppl I know or their frens marry tiong or Viet bu,btohqsg
And many MY wife. When the time comes  retire there. Who cares about SG ?,btohqsg
"""MY ""wife best . Can buy one bungalow at jb standby..",btohqsg
Now buy house in Malaysia all Jin cham,btohqsg
Tiagong those got car in MalaysiaTyre also no left,btohqsg
Anyway  to those newbies who ask  lalamove cannot earn money 1. Don't bother doing. Cs support non existent  jobs lousy and little  hard to snatch  go do other platform,btohqsg
Saw it posted 3 times!3 victim's!,btohqsg
Anyone know if rating affects chance of getting a job?,btohqsg
Oh oh. I just noticed my rating is 4. üòÖ I don't know when it becomes 4.,btohqsg
based on the last 40 orders.,btohqsg
Wonder how I drop to 4. 1 bad feedback drop 0.5?,btohqsg
it's the average of your last 40 orders.,btohqsg
im guessing though that one customer gave a 4.0 thinking it was a good review  and nobody else rated. so 4.0 is the average.,btohqsg
I see.. thank you for sharing,btohqsg
Under reviews  I see only 1 review - good attitude.,btohqsg
These scammers really Bo Leong SIM. LLM driver so cham liao still keep attacking... Wan scam aso scam the rich go invest maüòÖ,btohqsg
Tell this customer collect $600 from him 1st before make deposit if allowed,btohqsg
No lah.. I no rank wan.,btohqsg

Ya lo.. Bopian.. LL suck thumbüò¢,btohqsg
But they got enough healthcare workers n facilities to deal with the spike up or not? They not china can built a hospital in days n transfer doctors n nurses from other province,btohqsg
80-90% of the cases r not the serious cases. Those just stay home rest take normal flu meds. It's a flu virus anyway,btohqsg
As of now  the med facilities r sufficient bah,btohqsg
I also thought not serious till my relative pass away in vietnam few weeks back,btohqsg
Its down to self discipline for those who have light symptoms of flu or the covid to stay at hm n self quarantine,btohqsg
It becomes a problem when they don't do that,btohqsg
If really want develop vaccine for this  minimum proper vaccine needs 5 yrs,btohqsg
No country economy can tahan such a long time of closure,btohqsg
Much less sg  which depends alot on foreign investment,btohqsg

Hopes the numbers will break 4 figure tonite. Can help deter some ppl from going out...,btohqsg

Not all purchase service is a scam.As per Lalamove sop  customer must paynow you first before you buy the item  and limit is $75 for motorcycle and $150 for car.Purchase service is for buying items/food only  remittance  deposit etc is not allowed.,btohqsg
Lalamove should have a button to click scam suspicion and reject the job,btohqsg
JUST IN: Singapore reports 807 new Covid-19 cases  including 770 community infections.There were 34 cases among dormitory residents and 3 imported cases.MOH also reported 2 new clusters at Orange Valley Nursing Home in Simei and Jamiyah Nursing Home.https://str.sg/3SA2Stay in the know:str.sg,btohqsg
Anyone know how can I see orders later today around 6pm ?,btohqsg
I try many ways can only see until 1pm later today,btohqsg
There is a change in cashout function and now llm wants us to leave the few cents in wallet,btohqsg
u cannot cos there‚Äôs a limit on the number of orders u can see on the list,btohqsg
but one way is that u see requests that AJ for later,btohqsg
eg someone book 6pm job currently and it appeared at the top of the list,btohqsg
during peak periods worse - current time 1130 u cannot see 1230 jobs cos 1215 too many while all the 1200 ones are pick up now,btohqsg

Letting goCondition like new  never used1x Grabfood bike bag w drink holder1x Grabfood halal bag2x grabfood tee (6XL BRAND NEW NOT WORN)Everything for $50.Take and go. Self collection.,btohqsg
Be aware of this guy. I was inside my car waiting for order at upper circular road. I park my car in the parking lot and I'm inside the car he still insist to summon me. I video him give still show me his name tag and let me video him.,btohqsg
Cuz u in a paying lot lol,btohqsg
Means he is strict and go by the book. By right u need to pay for parking,btohqsg
Unless u r in a private lot,btohqsg
Actually u can politely tell the officer that u are picking up food.Most officers will understand if we driver are being courteous,btohqsg
I told him I picking order but he refuse to listen,btohqsg
To take tmr‚Äôs oddle orders u guys encounter any problem or is it just me? It says ‚Äúsomething went wrong  pls try again‚Äù.. anyone facing same issue?,btohqsg
Just drive off first lo n return bk   no choice if met with a super strict person,btohqsg
U nv know if someone is watching him too,btohqsg
I same problem. Llm don't want let us take now lah. Want us wait tmr +$ then takeüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

There won't be another lock down bro. Live with it,btohqsg

but that would be a global scale lockdown.,btohqsg
I don't think they will back to phase 2.,btohqsg
Go back heightening not so easy. Need to do alot of measure.,btohqsg
I personally feel like this currently better.,btohqsg
When number hit 4 digit every day. Gahmen dun even have to ban dine in. Wise ppl all will auto Siam dining places,btohqsg
Then   let us do the honour to deliver their food.,btohqsg
actually earlier this week traffic has been slightly lesser at night,btohqsg
partly due to people on QO from C+ cases,btohqsg
so it will be like what u said - naturally drop. dont need hard measures. the system will work its way to make it happen,btohqsg
Sinkies have no sense of danger one  will continue dine out  especially younger gen,btohqsg
Old one also... Still la kopi at kopitiam,btohqsg
When number hit the thousands everyday... I also dare not go out go deliver...earn peanuts nvm . Earn cobid spread whole family big stick,btohqsg
This is unofficial lalamove chat right,btohqsg
Those do part time  just take note.,btohqsg
Anyone know where to get the income statistic for march?,btohqsg
It's not reflecting in lalamove income statistic anymore,btohqsg
I think u guys shld just try out. Everyone earns different amount. Its just how much u want to do per day. Some drivers choose jobs  some drivers take any jobs. Some do whole day  some do few hours. How can we tell u on average how much u can earn a day? Also nowdays orders also not that much. And alot depends on whether u can bid n get the job. No harm just trying it out urself  if you find it not worth it then just stop and take back the deposit.,btohqsg
Copy from previous some ppl message,btohqsg
"Push to mod. Keyword ""Earn how much"". üòÇ",btohqsg
Look into the wednesday deposits in march in your bank account. Screenshot the april numbers  app only goes back 6 months.,btohqsg
LLM is use time to xchange money. See your time more precious or their money more precious,btohqsg
But sometimes put more time does not mean mo moneyüòÖ,btohqsg
Yea LLM only show past 6mths stats,btohqsg
the income stat page doesnt show the riders name/id or anything  so isnt useful as official documentation.,btohqsg
U still bother answer. Over this past mth so many newcomers ask this. Just try for themselves also don't want. Everything also want pple spoonfeedüòí,btohqsg
aiya tell them the pool depth 1.2m at the side and 2.5m in the middle they scared drown. so need to plot cross section of the pool then highlight the red line where the deep part is so that they know where not to venture,btohqsg
See till sick of all this ppl,btohqsg
Hi does anyone have this problem? When want to cashout forget the security code? How to reset?,btohqsg
Already did and reset done still can‚Äôt cash out,btohqsg

Amazon too far liao. Wonder y they never set up pick up at Tampines...,btohqsg
Won't be surprise LLM will need driver or riders to register daily ART test before receiving any jobs.,btohqsg
I also wonder why. Both so far. When want to return  also drive very far.,btohqsg
Their stuff fly in also drop at Changi. No Lee you set up their warehouse at julong,btohqsg
No  they come by sea. üòÇ,btohqsg
Once they have your phone no. That's it,btohqsg
Ah long  illegal activities. Police will track to your phone number. Unfortunately  some people do fall for this kind of scam,btohqsg
any way to contact lalamove other than live chat?,btohqsg
U call they will tell u bz go live chat,btohqsg
U call if get thru can buy toto,btohqsg
I haven't call this number yet. So  dunno the outcome.,btohqsg
This lumber ah neh neh pick up,btohqsg
the driver who take this will kena shortchanged,btohqsg
hello any driver wanna pick up order 5place,btohqsg
?? How come? What's the item?,btohqsg
its not the item. its the location,btohqsg
Any problem with the apps now?,btohqsg
Ooo. The person key a different postal code is it?,btohqsg
Can any one pick up my order at gaylang,btohqsg
Manage to trick the system for shorter distance. Lol.,btohqsg
My app  ‚ÄúSomething went wrong  please try again‚Äù ü•≤,btohqsg
Always try to restart  or reboot phone?,btohqsg
Then maybe is network issue le,btohqsg
Same.. Mine since 2pm on Oddle orders only üòê,btohqsg
Is there a change in cashout policy ?,btohqsg
Looks like ..the same on mine@jamesishere,btohqsg
Hi new here. So lalamove pay by per kilometer? Approximately 1 dollar?,btohqsg
Just got approved haven pay deposit yet haha,btohqsg
hello can ask if accept a order. is it max must be there in 30min?,btohqsg
Ya I think so. Unless scheduled arrangement,btohqsg
same. just activated yesterday and did 1 order only ü§£,btohqsg
"Unless is advance job  have to be there within ""10min grace period"" from pickup time",btohqsg
Anything past 10min  u likely will get late notice.,btohqsg
Maybe that's why bot rose don't react to cashout or cash out anymore,btohqsg
For oddle  think these days as long as u deliver within the timing indicated in the comment  they wont bother u,btohqsg
Oddle customers v funny one. Deliver early they will ask why come so early blablabla,btohqsg
Can say so... But for oddle  tricky hor. They notice you got late  they don't give u late notice liao  they just ban you from seeing their orders. ü§£,btohqsg
They only ban if u late deliver ba,btohqsg
Then u have to bug CS many times before they MIGHT review for you,btohqsg
And u wont be able to see order for the rest of the day if they cancels any of ur existing order from oddle,btohqsg
Aka only can see the next day,btohqsg
Yup. Some ppl cannot see for few days,btohqsg
Not worth to do LLM if no oddle  cuz lesser + I feel  higher chance you kena track by non-oddle customers and good luck getting orders along the way. Hahaha,btohqsg
Imagine they lost oddle as client,btohqsg
Which also mean  higher chance your rating can drop,btohqsg
Lol ü§£ then GrabExpress will take over üòÇ,btohqsg
Lol  u can try lor. Go collect late few times then u know,btohqsg
N u mostly late ah? By how many mins,btohqsg
Hahaha. They won't bother you  oddle just ban with no warning de,btohqsg
Llm will call u sometimes if ur late for pickup,btohqsg
The thing is if everyone starts being late for pickup  later llm start imposing more rules for stacking  then that makes it harder to make money,btohqsg

Or same location 2 different parcels send to 2 nearby location?,btohqsg
I no chan smell blue moon. Too tough to achieve,btohqsg
I 1 day intend to do 1 to 2 maybe 3 trips only.,btohqsg
I ever do before 2 diff pick up location to a same customer,btohqsg
The customer receive both food tgt from me,btohqsg
If u wan hit 200+ a day using car  will have to stack,btohqsg
Very good liao 3 trips 3 X $20= $60. Can pay for car liao,btohqsg
I doing about 5.30pm onwards haha,btohqsg

How cheap u wantüòÇ most is only 25%,btohqsg
That's why I thinking how cheap can it go,btohqsg

The most is only 25% but if others drivers here have an pdvl licence  they got another $3 off  so plus minus 29% off st sinopec.,btohqsg
Oh so llm is with sinopec,btohqsg

hello can ask if the person book motorbike but too heavy then i ask them to reassign,btohqsg
does it affect my rating or anything?,btohqsg
Now virus everywhere  gt option dun wanna fetch ppl,btohqsg
Bopian lo.. üòÇ Those staying north ok la.. Got 2 stations.. But those staying in east... Bopian,btohqsg
Reassign? Either u cancel or asked the particular person to topup lo.,btohqsg
ya like i went to livechat n told them too heavy then cancel order for me,btohqsg
but does it affect my ratings?,btohqsg
if is corporate client (i.e. oddle/chope/deliverychinatown etc)  u can live chat the agent to amend the order from motorcycle to car,btohqsg
tell them refer to the photo u uploaded,btohqsg
By right no. Cuz the CS will cancel your job  so customer can't rate you.,btohqsg
if is private / individual  just reassign,btohqsg
If you think you want to take the heavier/bigger order  then ask CS to get customer top up  and you proceed.For that  you complete the job  customer can rate you  might affect rating. Depends on how gl the customer.,btohqsg
Panda use car deliver bohua. Pay sucks...,btohqsg
Too heavy is like 15kg kind of heavy? Sometimes heavy 1-2kg  I think motorcyclist still will take la.Just bear in mind  taking heavier load on motorcycle is putting yourself at risk only. If you think you want to risk it for the top up  then ask CS get customer top up. But if you think safety more impt  of cuz valid reason to cancel  should not affect your rating in anyway.,btohqsg
Ya lor the pay suck thumb for carüòÇ,btohqsg
Soon or later.. New platform coming in..,btohqsg
Best is still LLM can choose job high pay but catch no lol,btohqsg
Hello  everyone.I did a job today from Serangoon Gardens to 6 different locations. The shop supposed to Paynow me but til now  I have yet to receive payment. I have contacted the shop and the shop replied will make payment. I have also contacted Lalamove and Lalamove have notified the shop about the outstanding payment.Just curious if more can be done to ensure we get our payments?,btohqsg
Just say. .It is LalaMove policy to be paid cash before i start the job. I cannot move until i am paid.Quote..customers paying by credit card.. they pay b4 start of job.. cash job is the same..,btohqsg
Nice..Will use this for future cash job. Thank you!,btohqsg
Depends some put note collect payment at receiver but then receiver say the person order shud pay which issender.how?,btohqsg
Whoever it is.. i will call them and ask for payment 1st b4 i start delivery..Receiver or deliverer.. call and ask money.. better ask money upfront then have to chase them..Some LLM ppl have done free delivery coz nvr get paid.. so better learn to protect yourselves..,btohqsg
Been there before. In the end cs say will help then no news ,btohqsg

hello why some advance order i click in to see details but it instantly kick me out say theres smth error. but i close n open up the order still there,btohqsg
Same here. I have to reset the app in order to take orders.,btohqsg

Wah biang. This order that goes to Airport Cargo to pickup. Siong sia. Other than exchange pass  I kenna checked machiam like container vehicle. Kenna that X-ray scan and have to wait for them to check 3 package  etc. All for just $15 extra. üò¢,btohqsg
i kana once b4. from then onwards will not take all this shit,btohqsg
Ya. Lesson learnt. I also realized why orders from Paragon no one wants to take. Enter carpark kenna $5 üòÇ,btohqsg
Cargo complex is damn far. Drive towards Changi Village and then keep on going‚Ä¶plus the time taken to change pass etc  not sure if the $15 covers it,btohqsg
I think exchange pass ccan ask llm for reimbursement,btohqsg
Eservices at police website got e-appeal,btohqsg
nice. dont think will pass the 20kg limit rule tho.,btohqsg
I realized there are almost no immediate orders till 11am+. ü§î,btohqsg
Biz bad  that's why the ad on TV so fierce lately,btohqsg
LLM has the brand name  but their rates are quite high  if you compare with other logicstics apps. Drivers flock to llm  but not so much for the customers.,btohqsg
High meh. After deduct comission not much. Their distance also further,btohqsg
Uparcel  for example  charges a $7 ($5.60 after 20%)  flat fee  islandwide. A similar LLM trip would be about $20+.,btohqsg
U parcel provide petrol and car? Do they know now a piece of Coe paper aready 70kü§£ü§£,btohqsg
LLM rates are very high for businesses. Good for drivers  but not for businesses.,btohqsg
Maybe drivers are stacking both UP and LLM together and see if some jobs can be stacked.,btohqsg
I saw a Foodpanda rider stacking both GrabFood and FP orders together.,btohqsg
well  good news is UP has a lot of open jobs... $7 across the island nobody want. But haha got a lot.,btohqsg
this one a bit harder to coordinate  cannot control which direction.,btohqsg
Parcel rates are low . But no time limit,btohqsg
Have time limit. Must deliver on same day else drive back to Sengkang to return the parcels.,btohqsg
The low rates already bad and their app always crashes,btohqsg
$2.50 is bulk rate? i assume nobody will pick up a single $2.50 job. Even take bus deliver also not worth it.,btohqsg
You will get 20-30 packages all within a 3-4km radius area.,btohqsg
But not worth because each parcel  you have to find parking  start  stop etc.,btohqsg
2 days at Woodlands industrial. Here got no jobs,btohqsg
Finally saw one end up let someone else got it haha,btohqsg
if within 3 to 4km  i would choose to use bicycle or e-bike instead of car,btohqsg
Your eBike no space. 20 parcels and some could be up to 5kg,btohqsg
I delivered vacuum cleaner before. Very bulky,btohqsg
