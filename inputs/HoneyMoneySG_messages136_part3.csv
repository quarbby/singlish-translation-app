I applied for HSBC giro for a new DBS credit card and received a rejection today saying CUSTOMER SIGNATURE NOT UPDATED IN BANK RECORD. Funny thing is- I already have 3 giro arrangements with hsbc ega and have previously physically gone to branch and provided signature a couple of yrs ago. Does it expire or is this a mismatch?,btohqsg
Read the tnc. They may have clause to allow them to claw back rewards if you cancel within a time period.,btohqsg
Most likely it's a mismatch with the signature,btohqsg
"DBS sent me 3 rejection letters stating HSBC replied with ""wrong account number"" even after HSBC sent me an SMS confirming the processing of GIRO application on the correct account number each time.It's a HSBC problem  they seem to hate DBS interbank GIRO applications. No issues when applying other bank's interbank GIRO with them.Good luck!",btohqsg
Dang..i just sent last wed. Hope all is good,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing your experience. I'm likely just going to retry. Very strange as I had no issues with uob and citi giro setup to hsbc in the past few months. Lol. üòÖ,btohqsg
The rest of the banks first try clear. With Maybank the fastest within a week or 2. DBS took me 5 months.,btohqsg
Could it be ur signature not matching in dbs record?,btohqsg
You don't sign for DBS for their interbank GIRO applications.,btohqsg
Guys if applying too many credit card will I affect my grading in credit bureau ?,btohqsg
Anyone facing issues with DBS app?,btohqsg
The letter states DBS was informed by HSBC that they have rejected the form,btohqsg
Yes if u apply too many in too short Period. Confirm your score goes down.However whether a low credit score in Singapore has any practical impact. Yet to be proven.,btohqsg
Last time i went to submit my giro form at dbs bank and the banker told me my signature didnt match their record. And dbs wont accept my submission. üòÜ its fair cuz i opened dbs acct decades ago.I had to provide new signature for them to update.,btohqsg
What is the advisable period gap should I be applying for the next card.. example card-A approve in Oct. card-B which month is more appropriate to apply?,btohqsg
My DBS CC giro to HSBC EGA is quite ok. Approved n completed in two months after submission. GIRO printed on bill generated two days ago.,btohqsg
