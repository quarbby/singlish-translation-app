Hi all  sorry if this question was already asked. What is the best between citi rewards + amaze vs. HSBC revo card?For me I see both are 4mpd cards so for everyday if I apply to only one  which one should I go for?,btohqsg
Main difference to me is Citi rewards exclude airlines n hotels.,btohqsg
I see  so because citi needs to be linked to amaze to work everywhere + exclude airlines and hotels.. HSBC is the better option? Is it a good card for a beginner?,btohqsg
oh citi rewards card doesnt give rewards for airlines and hotel spending?,btohqsg
My personal take is to use CRMC as primary  HSBC Revo as secondary because sometimes  some shops just dont fall within the MCC but are well.. part of life.Examples:- Haircut- See doctor- Pet supplies (assuming u dont buy from Shopee)- Telco payment- Service subscription like Netflix  Spotify [if not using SC Smart]Don't think u are travelling every time also rightðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Between UOB PRVI cards  which one do you recommend? AMEX  Visa or MC?,btohqsg
May I know why I canâ€™t trade forex in Webull? It only available for viewing  thereâ€™s no trade button over thr,btohqsg
just to confirm  CRMC refers to citibank rewards mastercard?,btohqsg
Yes  also CRMC covers items like online polyclinic/public hospital payment from HealthHub which HSBC revo doesnâ€™t cover. Also miles expire in 5 years compared to 3 years for HSBC revoVice versa HSBC revo covers travel spend  subject to 1k monthly spending cap of 4MPD,btohqsg
so between CRMC and citi cashback+ mastercard which has more benefits when using amaze?,btohqsg
CRMC if you convert points to cash  it is about 2.27% cashback  while cashback+ is 1.6% (2.0% if you have a Citi plus account).,btohqsg
Hi I have query regarding great eastern ilp great wealth advantage 3. This plan consist of a insurance portion and investment portion  however it does not have any fees regarding the insurance portion. Also does it means that 100% of the premium will go to investments after minus all the management fees. Thanks,btohqsg
I'm not entirely sure with UOB  but I won't take AMEX due to lack of support as much as the other two. Will take Mc over VISA due to support with Amaze(I'm assuming all these cards work the exact same way  and they cannot be used for public transport),btohqsg
Thank you! Understand that the difference is no travel expenses coverage for CRMC + less eligible merchants for HSBC + 5yrs miles expiry for CRMC vs 3yrs miles expiry HSBC.Iâ€™ll consider HSBC because I actually would use the travel expenses but donâ€™t spend enough daily to use 2 cards,btohqsg
No min spend for both cards so doesn't matter can slowly accumulate. If u think after 3 years still not enough miles to travel .. then u shld be going fr cashback cards instead,btohqsg
To me  I dont have Netflix n pet. Telco payment has other better option depends on promo. Medical is covered by company.  Haircut shop dont except credit card(neighbour type).So my airlines + hotel expenses > the rest of expenses in a year.,btohqsg
AMEX has bonus points + limo. But agree about acceptance,btohqsg
The benefit you get out of HSBC Revo is the 1% cashback from HSBC Everyday+ Programme and thats pretty much it. Oh  and why I will suggest HSBC Revo as secondary is because there's no Annual Fee on it too unlike CRMC so.. better to use CRMC more actively too,btohqsg
Is there any card besides UOB Absolute Cashback that hasn't excluded SAM?,btohqsg
Hi i just joined last week and observe people here doesnt discuss about investing in equity. Am i right? Is there another channel or any community recommendations that can join or learn from?,btohqsg

For credit card  take a look at amaze wallet 4% instapoints  will discuss in upcoming video.E-wallet can use touch n goCash can withdraw from Trust bank,btohqsg
Thank you Chris. Have a great weekend ahead,btohqsg
Hey Chris  I only start to watch your video a few days ago. Now i watch about 2-4 of your videos everyday.I dont  like to accumulate points. I usually go for cash rebates. My thinking is that u exchange point for travel ticket  you will end up spending more.,btohqsg
For this  you can ask@mttelegrammtwho recently just converted from a cashback fanatic to miles user now,btohqsg
haha thanks for the shoutout..i am still Team Value where I will choose the proposition that makes most sense.My opinion is:6mpd cards no need argue. Confirm win any cashback card.4mpd cards are on par with 8% cashback cards.2mpd cards win those 1.6% cashback cards.But one thing for sure is you are definitely still paying more than the economy ticket cash price when you redeem a business class ticket. (based on the cashback given up). Kind of forced upselling but you are getting a business class ticket at much lower than it would have cost with cash.,btohqsg
But one thing is for sure.. getting the Elusive Saver Business class redemption is going to be much much harder than the cashback that you see credited into your credit card account.,btohqsg
apples with apples! SQ TICKET TO JAPAN!!!,btohqsg
I not so interested in Japan Korea all these. My next dream destinations are Israel  Mozambique egypt and Tanzania.,btohqsg
I find those are journeys worth going lor bananas or no bananas,btohqsg
Go same place all the time v sian,btohqsg
see your preference loh.. my household likes to go the same old places... do familar things. more relax less surprises,btohqsg
Hmmm yah i can see why if have kids or if a bit older i would go familiar places. Safer  easier to get around. But i feel if still healthy should go and see the rest of the world. After all you only live once.,btohqsg
Me peasant don't see much value in business class tickets ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
correct... no right no wrong..4mpd cards were not attractive enough to lure me to the darkside of J redemption. 6mpd was the one that kicked me over.i won't put all my eggs on one basket.. continue earning cashback on my high cashback cards.. and slowly earn 6mpd as priority  and using 4/3 mpd cards as and when needed.,btohqsg
For the UOB EVOL sign up promo  does the first 50 start from the sign up date or completion date of the requirements?,btohqsg

Working hard is prerequisite to success. Work hard and wait for the opportunity to come. U never know when the chance will come by,btohqsg
For those chasing FIRE  do u find it better to use Cashback or Miles Credit Cards?,btohqsg
Cashback. Because Miles causes u to spend more,btohqsg
