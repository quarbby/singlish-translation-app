Ah ok. Tough for me.i pair it with uob lady for now,btohqsg
Can't find citi pay all says 4mpd cap at 1k,btohqsg
already clarified there is no 4mpd for citi payall,btohqsg
2.2mpd for 120k max and 8k min  pay 2.2%,btohqsg
Was referring to pairing citi rewards with citi payall,btohqsg
Does that mean citi rewards does not qualify for citi pay all??? Or basically the 4mpd is excluded for citi payall transactions?,btohqsg
citi payall excluded from bonus points for online spend  usually only 1x points or 0.4mpd for citi payall  2.2mpd under the promo which needs min $8k by 20 Aug,btohqsg
So after 20 Aug  it'll revert back to 0.4mpd for any citi miles card?Ie paying 2.2% for 0.4mpd? Sorry for my poor maths  but does that still make citi payall worthwhile?,btohqsg
after 20 Aug  0.4mpd for citi rewards  1.2mpd for citi pm and 1.3mpd for citi prestige. May not be worth it,btohqsg
One of the few ways to pay for insurance  and get something.only good when there's such promo,btohqsg
Hi may I know abt how long will it take for me to start using citi credit card (to qualify for singsaver gift min spend) from the day I apply?,btohqsg
Thank you so so very much for the clarification,btohqsg
Thank you for your help üôèüèæüôèüèæ,btohqsg
Hi all  slightly off tangent questions from the usual.What company to use to purchase most affordable foreign domestic helper insurance? Thank you!,btohqsg
Uob credit card add to online shopee platform eligible for 500$ uob one spend cash rewards?,btohqsg
Hi guys  do u all have a usd account in bank? Like maybe an account with HSBC usd account. I was thinking should i convert sgd into usd using a bank account then i transfer usd into the broker account like tiger. Please share on how you manage or exchange your USD. Thanks üôèüèª,btohqsg
Simply go is excluded for CRMC linked to amaze right?,btohqsg
tiger conversion rate is probably better than banks,btohqsg
UOB krisflyer only has a very small whitelist of travel partners and they are all online websites. Since OP said no online payment then this option is no good.,btohqsg
If I have a huge online payment which I go for bank's interest free 12 month installment of say $2K a month to DBSWWMC  do I earn 4mpd on the installment amount of $2K every month or only once based on the total spend of $24K?,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply üôèüèª I now i know tiger rates better. I use interactive broker to exchange USD  i know there is a USD $2 fees. I am curious to know the best way to convert and save up use to buy S&P üòÅ,btohqsg
ibkr is better after a certain amount  can't remember the exact number but a safe threshold is use IBKR to convert if above $10k sgd. else use momoo/tigerthis may be outdated info so  please verify! or hopefully someone who recently ran the numbers could verify,btohqsg
Icic. I think i prefer to change 1-2k usd a month. I asked a few telegram groups and seems that people not bothered by the exchange rates so the difference might not be that huge,btohqsg
Maybe wise but I not sure. I using ibkr method. So u have to test yourself,btohqsg
Haha yes bro. I just return SG at 10pm today. My 2 kidneys still intact üòÇ,btohqsg
hi  the [UOB krisflyer account] is a separate account from the [UOB one account] right? i.e depositing 50k into thhe UOB one account only earns the UOB one interest  and not the UOB krisflyer benefits as well,btohqsg
I think usually no points awarded for utility bill payments. Try citipayall,btohqsg
Hi guys  is it normal that citibank is charging a currency conversion fee (1%) when booking a hotel on agoda in sgd?,btohqsg
yes it is known as Cross Border Fee.Happens when the SGD transaction is processed by overseas payment processor. Agoda payment processor is in Hong Kong. Apple Itunes payment processor is in Ireland.,btohqsg
Pair the credit card with Amaze to circumvent the Cross Border Fee  but beware of any implications your credit card rewards could have if paired with Amaze (e.g. DBS excludes Amaze and UOB Krisflyer may not recognise the merchant name if masked by Amaze*),btohqsg
I guess he used 7mpd for Agoda with Citi Premiermiles. Amaze will give 1.2mpd only,btohqsg
yup then no choice have to pay the 1% loh.,btohqsg
I usedagoda.com/en-gb/citisgmastercardto get the 18% off ... I just checked and HSBC is not charging the fee when paying agoda.,btohqsg
"Interestingly the transaction description when paying with citibank card includes""Internet HK""  but when paying with HSBC it says ""Internet SG""",btohqsg
applied for the UOB Lady's card last night at 11pm. this morning login IB and saw the card approved already. thats really fast!,btohqsg
Tried to replicate this against my existing hotel bookings.. does not allow me to deviate from PAY AT HOTEL (which does not qualify for discount)!,btohqsg
"This one is a side by side comparison (left picture is using Citi Agoda ""18% discount"" while right side is just Agoda with a generic discount code (can use any card to pay  I used Amaze+UOB Lady) that I booked one month ago. Same dates same hotel same room type for March 2024.",btohqsg
If I credit my salary to a UOB One account  is it really worth to have other bank accounts with no interest rate benefit just to get different credit cards?,btohqsg
Hi guys  for HSBC credit do it provide a separate estatement for the supplementary card so you know what the person send on. Or is it combine with the principle account estatement?,btohqsg
I guess it will only be printed on statements when you receive it. It won‚Äôt show on the website or apps when you make the booking. Above is my experience with HSBC revo when booking airline ticket on oversea website.,btohqsg
no need bank account to get credit card,btohqsg
So can I combine a let's say an HSBC card or DBS card with a UOB One account?,btohqsg
combine for? if u mean payment  u can pay other bank cc from uob one account via uob app/website or AXS app/website,btohqsg
You can hold any credit card eg.  HSBC card or DBS card without holding their bank account. Use them for your daily expenses.and also hold UOB One account for your saving. If your expenses is more than $500 or $600  use it on UOB Evol  One or Lady card can give you higher interest on your UOB One saving with min $1600 salary crediting.,btohqsg
Interesting  so in that case I won't need to open any HSBC/DBS accounts  right?,btohqsg
No need. If you have saving more than $100k  then may need to strategise so you can get higher interest every month on your saving.It all depends on how much and what are your monthly expenses then can see which credit card is suitable for you.,btohqsg
Any idea how long it takes before I will receive the sms informing me that I am eligible for the 1% cashback on eligible spend and giro bill payments for HSBC EGA? I have deposited $2 000 and made 5 eligible transactions since the start of the month and have done these a second time last week to try to trigger the fulfilling criteria but no sms so far,btohqsg
Hi gurus. I use Kris pay app for dinning and link to my hsbc revo card using google pay. Can I still get the bonus points for 4mpd? üôèüèª,btohqsg
I didn't get any sms either  and I did the 2k+5trx just a couple days before I used giro and still got the cashback,btohqsg
anyone know is there a daily limit to transfer money out of moomoo?,btohqsg
