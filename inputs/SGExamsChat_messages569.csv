oh my quiz is like 10 qns and i did like 5 times,btohqsg
time to lift to get those right bro,btohqsg
i have a pr of 200 grams,btohqsg
my linear algebra math mod gave us a week to try as many times as we want to get full marks,btohqsg
bro my poly legit trolling..tf is this,btohqsg
can u like open ur curtains,btohqsg
"thought i would have saw ""all options""",btohqsg
have you not gone through a select all that applies and all are applicable,btohqsg
if they say check all that apply  that’s how it’s usually presented,btohqsg
its ok they subject matter expert,btohqsg
anyway idk about your poly but when i get unlimited tries on a quiz  it’s usually just to make sure we eventually get the concepts,btohqsg
like it’s more of participation points,btohqsg
granted what ends up happening is people just trial and error,btohqsg
^ doing quizzes helps you to get your concepts down,btohqsg
but if you think 999 attempts is stupid  then great  dont use it,btohqsg
plus i think for my math mod where we type in numbers right,btohqsg
me: selects all and sees the right ans  and i jot down LOL,btohqsg
unlimited attempts mean i don’t get fucked by typing 1.0 instead of 1.00,btohqsg
i seen my brother suffering in ntu,btohqsg
all I see in this chat is abt gpa,btohqsg
i actually straight up forgot on one quiz for my mod,btohqsg
but i think i did well enough for finals,btohqsg
can listen to boomer ‘s jazz music alr,btohqsg
not that i think the idea they give 999 tries being stupid but the min requirement to pass that module being particularly stupid,btohqsg
to pass  you need to get 8/10 for all the quizzes  if you get 7/10 for just one. you are remodding the whole mod,btohqsg
focus on getting more than 2 instead of this,btohqsg
im at a stalemate right now...most of it are projects..and i can't pre-read resources,btohqsg
that is another thing about rp...you can't pre-read anything,btohqsg
then wank for post nut clarity,btohqsg
because they dont allow you to,btohqsg
ya. its the minimum requirement because maybe they want to see that you actually put in the effort in consistency  yes  999 tries but have you heard of repetition? if you wanna get bare minimum to pass  then sure whatever do the bare minimum,btohqsg
some people may want to redo do take it in  these 999 tries if there is no deadline  could be used for repetition over the semester to confirm that you still remember the stuff ok im done talking here i will talk to my wall,btohqsg
idk why Ryan nvr considered ite,btohqsg
chat gpt  google scholar  friends  prior learning,btohqsg
then end up..i go into a poly in the same general location,btohqsg
im in the east..the course i wanted was rail related,btohqsg
transport is all in the west,btohqsg
im not even gonna deal with this,btohqsg
ok nvm...if im making yall loose braincells..,btohqsg
i did considered..was just too far. thats it,btohqsg
yep. had to leave for a bit,btohqsg
but can get u to a good biz course in poly if u scored well - all 3 offers this,btohqsg
no  you already made me lose braincells when you were talking to 2 CS students about CS and physics to a Physics phd person,btohqsg
you think i really think what i said?,btohqsg
no i think you dont think,btohqsg
my best scoring subjects were maths and poa in o levels,btohqsg
but i never had intrest in business,btohqsg
if u calculate   it ‘s like $16 per mth,btohqsg
but uk sg rly isn’t the place to learn & embrace such things,btohqsg
"you should rephrase to ""VR and world creation"" before you start thinking tech is just about VR and world creation",btohqsg
u want to learn such things   Switzerland   France   Spain   Germany   Japan & China have more potential,btohqsg
i know  but honestly learning Poa for 3 whole years killed any last bit of intrest i had for business,btohqsg
i know that as well  thats why im in technology. Ill see where this pathway brings me,btohqsg
i honestly did researched..singapore is the last country you want for blue collar jobs,btohqsg
why wld u even choose to learn such things in sg   idgi,btohqsg
lets say a chicken rice is 4 bucks  you are gonna be broke just eating 4 chicken rice a month,btohqsg
but u don’t realize a related dip is not required to get into what u love if u score well,btohqsg
next year more than $4 alr,btohqsg
u can do biz course & jump into eng persay,btohqsg
jurong east mrt chicken rice is 2.50,btohqsg
"""if i score well""  that is the caveat. are you telling me to try and push my mindset into getting into a course that i have 0 interest in and trying to score well in it?",btohqsg
yea if u have no choice   that ‘s what u shld have done,btohqsg
if u have choices   ofc not,btohqsg
with my o levels results  the course i entered was my best choice alr,btohqsg
but got ite what. what is bad abt hn,btohqsg
I bet with u   many ite lecturers are better than ur rp ones,btohqsg
Im not trying to be smart here...All these i know  i just never put any of my thoughts into action,btohqsg
you see the thing is hes stated he wants bare minimum or something (i cant be bothered to remember his exact quote) so even if he went to ITE  where mind you  some people ACTUALLY wanna learn and be constantly improving  there will always be something he would complain or talk about no matter where he goes. i think if you start a debate on chicken  he will start finding problems with chicken. maybe the bone too much in the chicken rice? or wtv. anyways  what i saying is that whereever he goes  i think he just want to do the bare minimum to get out and go  no point in switching sch/courses just because some lecturers are better.,btohqsg
doesnt mean lecturer better = better student,btohqsg
Dude who wants bones in chicken rice,btohqsg
If I ask  stall owner will whack me,btohqsg
man really deleted that shit fast where he was talking about how its an act,btohqsg
anyway this was stupid but entertaining bye yalls,btohqsg
You honestly think i want to live a life where i constantly have to depend on others and not better myself? Im not that naive and if you think i am. I have no words as well.,btohqsg
i hate presentations but you sure as hell know ill make a banger slide,btohqsg
who likes presentations u tell me,btohqsg
but WE put in efforts to make it look nice,btohqsg
i think if ppl saw my presentation they think i love presentation,btohqsg
i’ve still yet to figure out how to use that,btohqsg
eh during bmt training do yall do sit ups on mat,btohqsg
"I was forced into a corner by my parents  what was i suppose to do. Before getting my national exams  i told them that if all dont work out i would go ite...But neither of them really supported my decision. My father told me ""dont waste your time"" and wanted me to go NS instead. I told them its not wasting my time...But who am i kidding  im still living under their house.I got my results and saw them contented i could go sec 5  so i did...i told myself i had once chance to make it into a poly. So i did  i tried my best in sec 5 and manage to get into a poly...I did not know how rp or what rp was then then i took that leap of faith.At sec 5  i could not bring myself to tell my parents i rather get into ite than rp..knowing full well how my father was. That is the whole backstory",btohqsg
rip my spine or wtv was grinding on the ground,btohqsg

How realistic is it for countries to implement a national minimum wage for all their workers?‘Fossil fuels should no longer have a part in the production of energy.’ Discuss.Consider the view that spending money on space travel cannot be justified in today’s world.Consider the argument that there should be no censorship of the arts in modern society.‘People who undertake voluntary work do so more for their own benefit than for the benefit of others.’ Discuss.Assess the extent to which all people in your society have the opportunity to achieve their full potential.‘The quality of human interaction is diminished by modern communication devices.’ How far do you agree?To what extent are festivals and national holidays effective in promoting unity in your society?‘Regret for past actions is vital for progress.’ What is your view?Evaluate the claim that sports personalities make good role models for young people.Assess the view that accurate translation between languages is always necessary.‘Young people want to change the world because they do not know it is impossible.’ How far do you agree?,btohqsg
