no one cares enough when you're in sh,btohqsg
unless whatever area u study & work  they'll tell once u that certain areas require the formal / hard safety boots,btohqsg
safety boots also hv so many diff types,btohqsg
Wait any jc students here with strict code of shoes and clothing?,btohqsg
i see  mostly depends on how their sch principal,btohqsg
last time some jcs v laid-back,btohqsg
anyone can go inside the school grounds as long as u look like a jc student / have a jc shirt of that school,btohqsg
but uh usually its just obv don't break the student conduct until u expose urself,btohqsg
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-families-spent-1-8-billion-on-private-tuition-for-children-in-2023Just curious how much you guys even paid for tuition classes?,btohqsg
probably 1000 for the 2 subjs i took in jc,btohqsg
and i didnt even need tuition for one of those subj tbh,btohqsg
i just went so that i cld spend 2h a week studying that subj,btohqsg
what subjects did you take in jc,btohqsg
i had to take tuition for o level eng because my school's department didnt know wtf they were doing,btohqsg
Sec school and pri sch days I get basic tutoring uh for mostly math 200 + to 300+ per month ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… adjusted for inflation 230 to 330+,btohqsg
Wait  one lesson a week  or?,btohqsg
She had to enroll tutoring for the same reason : poor teaching at  sch,btohqsg
"""for comprehension look through past mistakes"" my brother in christ this isnt mathematics the passage changes every time",btohqsg
I mean  the technique should roughly be the same no?,btohqsg
I only know it was paid per 4 lesson weekly haha approx a month have to pay tutoring centre/tutor,btohqsg
thats the part they didnt teach,btohqsg
Because if you looked through past mistakes you would probably spot what you were missing  what was marked excess denies  etc.,btohqsg
and then the department only churns out one exam paper and answer key per year for all 4 cohorts,btohqsg
and thats the prelim paper ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
How you want the student to score A then?,btohqsg
so the marking was bipolar as hell for internal exams because they were fully relying on someone else's answer key,btohqsg
41.2% dist rate for english this year,btohqsg
i've only ever taken tuition once,btohqsg
but i remember some parents offering me quite a bit to give private tuition after i said i was too busy in my normal schedule,btohqsg
they get away with it because our school's command of english isnt poor and somehow the dept is so bad at both teaching and marking that the students have gone full circle,btohqsg
You could give private tuition to justify buying more $400 pants,btohqsg
i have a lot more shit to pay for now,btohqsg
but the amount of extra work wouldn't justify giving up the little time i have,btohqsg
what subjects are you even gonna take,btohqsg
Haha... this is one reason why I volunteer to come out with materials with ppl online,btohqsg
wait ... you in jc yet?,btohqsg
oh do you want to see one question i set,btohqsg
i studied beforehand so i'm familiar with the entire syllabus,btohqsg
here's one question in fm syllabus,btohqsg
if you want fm materials i made some stuff on DEs and other topics  available online,btohqsg
i mean i can help with anything that isn't the e,btohqsg
I know is partial derivatives notation  so is PDE solving ?,btohqsg
don't you get tired from reading Latex?I find Times New Roman / Arial easier for my eyes to read.,btohqsg
Personally I much prefer the LaTeX font,btohqsg
I could typeset it actually to use a different font,btohqsg
but i'm much more used to the default,btohqsg
Nope  you just need to verify a solution for (b),btohqsg
i type everything in latex now since i write papers,btohqsg
I cannot expect FM student to use Green's functions or whatever to solve PDE,btohqsg
Does it auto sync to the cloud or GitHub or something lol,btohqsg
