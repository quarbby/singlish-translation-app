for chocolate fund  the 4.8% return guarantee starts the moment you put money in or the moment you sign up in the app?,btohqsg
Cant check individual trnx anymore. Have to use spreadsheet to manually track,btohqsg
It starts the moment you create the account. The guaranteed interest is 4.2% pa.So if you created the account at 11pm  once it clicks into midnight  the first interest will be deposited.,btohqsg
so just put in 20k then ok already?,btohqsg
Put 19.5k or something similar. Once u go above 20k  your amount can go down. üòÖ,btohqsg
Yes. I will keep the account at no more than $20k though as advised by Chris in his latest video,btohqsg
sorry i'm new to investing. but the money will be credited into the acc daily?,btohqsg
i don't remember the percentage amount but i can only think this amount so i just bomb,btohqsg
Yes daily. This is based on a starting deposit of $15k in mid July,btohqsg
gg i will miss 1 day already.,btohqsg
If you any how bomb  other people will also anyhow bomb you. üòÜ,btohqsg
1 day is not much if you‚Äôre putting anything under $20k as advised. Better late than never though üëçüèª,btohqsg
i will follow like what they say to put in $19.5k as i initially wanted to put in $20k straight,btohqsg
Yea I think $19.5k leaves enough room ($500) to maximise ur interest earnings cos anything above $20k gives a different rate,btohqsg
alrights thanks all for the assistance,btohqsg
hello.. can i ask if ibkr has any dormant fees? is the only fees at purchase? thanks alot in advance,btohqsg

Good morning! is it cheaper to buy mutual funds / money market funds like Fullerton sgd cash fund on endowus fund smart rather than platforms like moomoo via moomoo cash plus ?,btohqsg
You can simulate on endowus and do the math.,btohqsg
Hey Thank you for your reply ! The reason I ask is because Endowus states fund fee 0.21 - trailer fee 0.08 = 0.13% (fund fees after cashback) then I checked moomoo it states management fees 0.16% + admin fees / performance fee / trust fee (refer to product sheet).  Then I went to see the product sheet it is so vague ‚Ä¶ the fees state up to 0.1% ‚Ä¶ what does that even mean lol,btohqsg
At least we agar agar know how much. But if buy thru moomoo the fees are quite opaque‚Ä¶ haha but yea la in the grand scheme if the amount invested is small it is likely negligible. What is your own practice ? üò¨,btohqsg
Endowus for cpf. Others   buy myself via tiger/moo moo if money market funds.,btohqsg
Yes. Krispay mile is Kris+ currency.,btohqsg
