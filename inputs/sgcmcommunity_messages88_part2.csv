wah didn‚Äôt know sg got white s207 haha,btohqsg
more rare then the yellow ones in sg that means,btohqsg
wah this one s207 ah? why he mod sia,btohqsg
I could be wrong  one of the bosses of MI owns it.,btohqsg
cos s207 use the pre fl bumper,btohqsg
Oh  then maybe this the sti only,btohqsg
i‚Äôm a huge fan of the s207  i got a black 1/18 model haha,btohqsg
Ok this the sti only haha,btohqsg
i‚Äôd assume s207 would get the slightly better end of the build quality,btohqsg
i rmb what convinced my family to buy levorg was also cos i saw it win wagon off the year in sgcm award 2016,btohqsg
Oh u had one? Stock or modded,btohqsg
I used to see one often. I think was dark blue,btohqsg
everything stock except rims üò¨ cos other people still need use,btohqsg
some levorgs in sg are really really nicely done up,btohqsg
a lot of money put into them,btohqsg
pity they are 1.6 and cvt,btohqsg
Yeah it did pique my interest until insee its 1.6L,btohqsg
Subaru cvt is a different breed leh,btohqsg
recently mighty car mods ej swapped and sti manual swapped a levorg  best part was all the components fit perfectly cos it shares very similiar platform to wrx,btohqsg
this means some cockster in factory decided to put a 1.6 and a cvt in instead of a 2.5 manual,btohqsg
Someone told me there is a 2.0 levorg own by MI .not sure how true is the urban legend,btohqsg
First time see u talk here lol,btohqsg
Familiar. I shall ask my source haha,btohqsg
Guys. Need help and advise with coe renewal. Currently PQP at 107. By end Nov. likely up and down? I think until headache liao sia.,btohqsg
pls do i am curious too haha,btohqsg
528 worth to renew  maybe not as much since pqp is 107k  compared to last year. But still comparable to the market assuming your parf is about under 25k?,btohqsg
If your coe is not ending next month  u can still wait it out  and see how the market goes.Fyi the moving average for the past 2 months is 106 726. So if the next month drops a bit  the new pqp should be lower than now.,btohqsg
Anyone can recommend any brand for diy ceramic or graphene coating?,btohqsg
Gyeon and carpro have diy friendly coatings which are very good.,btohqsg
TODAY I‚ÄôD ESPECIALLY LIKE TO WISH ALL THE FOREIGN WORKERS WHO LEFT THEIR FAMILIES TO COME HERE TO MAKE THIS A BETTER PLACE A VERY GOOD MORNING!!,btohqsg
yah u see those dirty things appearing also right,btohqsg
