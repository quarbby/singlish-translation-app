Hi gurus  I have $8k in excess of $100k. What shd I do now?,btohqsg
It usually comes at the end of the following month for me.https://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/cards/tncs-governing-ocbc-infinity-cashback-card-programme.pdf,btohqsg
Transfer to other high interest saving account for 1 month to reset it to zero or $3k to avoid $2 fall below fee. Eg uob 5%  HSBC EGA  etc…,btohqsg
Hi would like to seek opinions.I have a ILP which is not doing great  but will incur surrender penalty if I terminate it <10 years  I still have 2.5 years to go. I am placing $200per mth and have invested $18k to date. Surrender value is $14k.My previous FA had recommended me to “cut my losses” and reinvest it to a new product   but I was less savvy back then + cannot afford the $600pm for the product she was recommending.Still not great now - but I am working on building my 100K for Uob one   and going to start to look at other areas such as ETFsTIA,btohqsg
You're working towards 100k the 18k to date is to reach what terminal value? Seem like a small savings ac of 200pm. Recommend don't dump it,btohqsg
Thank you for the sharing of resetting. May i know how often shd we do the reset and the rationale?,btohqsg
My thought is no matter what  interest earned from ILP is still typically better than what you earned from a bank account.   Considering you have only 2.5yrs left  that is not very far off. I surprised your previous FA will recommend something that is not sustainable for you. That is not in the best interest for you from my viewpoint.,btohqsg
Why need to pump more money? Can always just switch fund and status quo on premium.,btohqsg
I’ve similar ILP condition. But I believe it is the insurance cost that ate up. Maybe just leave it (for protection purpose only) iso switching,btohqsg
Once you have your 100k in UOB one account  suggest not to touch that account at all. Leave the money there to earn the 5% annually. Have another account that you can use to deposit and deploy your money easily. There are such accounts that allow that and you can still earn reasonable interest. Ex: 3%,btohqsg
what is the surrender penalty ?,btohqsg
Typically ILPs have large fees that will eat into your premiums+gains  to the point where it’ll take years for the investment gains to offset the fees and you get to a breakeven point.But some details required to be able to make a better informed decision are:1. How much is the surrender penalty?2. What has been the historical performance of the invested fund?3. What fund types are available to invest?,btohqsg
The 100k uob one account only exists while the fed rate remain High. Given possible rate cuts and sora to follow its good to look into other investments and do take note of duration risk! If you're not buying any big ticket items like renovation or car or house  it's perfectly fine to park them in a non bank account/ fixed deposits for a longer term,btohqsg
Current accounts or savings account have an effective duration of zero! Recommend some medium term savings investments meanwhile. 3 to 5 years etc etc,btohqsg
She inherited my ILP  could be partly want me to earn better % and also want to earn comms too. Haha,btohqsg
Thanks all for your inputs 🙏,btohqsg
