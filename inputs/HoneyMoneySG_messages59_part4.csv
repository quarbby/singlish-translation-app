HSBC told me I can take out on 1 August so I did üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
So your reference month is Apr and the participating months are May June and July? If so  we are under the same promo  means I can also withdraw now liao. :),btohqsg
My participating months only 2 months,btohqsg
Can check which credit card will still earn rebate/points for top up to grab wallet?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm already take out on the 1st of August,btohqsg
Ya. Cimb fast saver quite confusing. I donno whether they calculate the interest on daily rest balance ro at month end. Or they calculate the interest on average monthly balance for the interest.,btohqsg
Just put in gxs or stash acc direct no confuse conditions.,btohqsg
with the changes to dbs altitude  what would be a good alternative that isnt ladies card with travel selected. Would dbs wwmc be a good alternative just for the travel portion. If so  would the points for the two cards pool so i can cancel my altitude without losing my existing miles?,btohqsg
hi guys  what is the best card to spend overseas? does uob krisflyer credit card allow for 3mpd on overseas spend?,btohqsg
UOB Lady's Card + Amaze at 6mpd  alternatively Citi Rewards Card + Amaze at 4mpd,btohqsg
already provided by DBS - see this page,btohqsg
Ok gotcha  just wondering because i maxed out my citi rewards already and the lady‚Äôs solitaire only covers certain categories so for the non covered one was thinking what to use,btohqsg
Still have OCBC Titanium + Amaze at 4mpd if hitting caps,btohqsg
Uob lady doesn't have this MCC as bonus points right,btohqsg
Why UOB lady‚Äôs with Amaze? Online is not required,btohqsg
I think UOB KF works right? Anyone else can confirm?,btohqsg
does it give 3mpd on overseas spend?,btohqsg
So NET* transaction with MCC 5499 (for example) is still eligible for the 6.67% Cashback + min $600 spending right,btohqsg
i think uob kf + amaze should work  but yet to try,btohqsg
Currently due to a promo rate until 31 aug  must be oversea spending in foreign currency min of $1.5k spending,btohqsg
yes but after that what will be the mpd?,btohqsg
1.2 mpd after promo   better to just use it with amaze,btohqsg
if i recently deposit house sales proceeds into uob 1  then transfer it from uob 1 to uob stash  does it count as incremental fresh funds?,btohqsg
i thought as long as spent $800 on sq or scoot can get 3mpd for those online category?,btohqsg
Online yes but OP were asking for oversea spending,btohqsg
ahhh  so better to pair with amaze to make it online,btohqsg
How do I convert uob hdb housing loan instalment into credit card payment?,btohqsg
Any reason why you aren‚Äôt using cash to invest into snp?,btohqsg
Cash is already deployed to QQQM via Syfe trade. S$3000 monthly DCA is enough for now,btohqsg
Would it worth to pair Amaze + SC simply cash for Cashback?,btohqsg
Ahh I see okay. So it‚Äôs 2k cpf OA and 1k cash.,btohqsg
Does anybody know about the HSBC EGA account what if I withdraw all the balance from the account on the 1st of August (my participating months is April  May  June and July )1) will I still eligible to receive 4.3% bonus on the September2) If I keep the EGA Account on 0 balance what if next time I transfer money in will the bank change me for the fall below fee $5,btohqsg
Good day senior.I am still using grab paylater. And I need to top up/pay for it.What is the best way to do it?Thank you üôè,btohqsg
UOB Amex absolute gives 0.3% rebateMinimal but better than nth,btohqsg
No. If you do bank transfer then no charge. If use credit card then there might be some charge,btohqsg
What you plan to spend on n what is the mcc code? You need to call UOB CSO to find out the whole mcc on the list must be from Shopee  Lazada n Qoo10 OR only 7278 must be from the Shopee  Lazada n Qoo10,btohqsg
Maybe I should not use grabpay so often. Change to shopback pay?,btohqsg
Ya Grabpay as good as useless now,btohqsg
For scb smart credit card   the 6% on bus mrt  fast food is it only for limited period or no time period defined,btohqsg
Hi I am wondering what is the best way to get cashback if I spend $2k per month,btohqsg
Yes I am looking at UOB one  if I am a new user I get this enhanced 5%,btohqsg
I using it to pay for wedding  is it counted as eligible transaction?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have so don‚Äôt know  because I don‚Äôt like the quarterly cashback system,btohqsg
It depends on what did you spend n is it in the exclusion list.  Is the $2k part of instalment.,btohqsg
Cimb 3.5% saving promo  saving min $1k and current min $5k  so fastsaver is saving or current?,btohqsg
If it is part of instalment is it eligible?,btohqsg

Hi all  quick question  does UOB lady card earn 6mpd if I choose dining and use it to buy food with1. Shopback2. Favepay,btohqsg
Shopback generally safe except bakeryFavepay have some dps saying favepay mcc might not always follow the merchant. (If merchant never setup properly it can be computer services),btohqsg
Thank you for this document  I might need to clarify if it is a instalment,btohqsg
