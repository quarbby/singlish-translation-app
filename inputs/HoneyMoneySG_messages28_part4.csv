Anyone having issues with kris+ challenges? It shows nothing on the challenges page.,btohqsg

Regarding the signup bonus for EGAHow to go about the trading account any tricks ?,btohqsg
This is one of the risks with Instarem Amaze. Best is to unlock the card before you paywave  and after paying  straight away unlock.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the difference between in-store purchase and online purchase btw? Also  should I disable online purchase for instarem amaze and use my Citi Rewards instead? Is the 1% cashback worth the risk?,btohqsg
I have asked they said online purchase is for buying stuffs online  In-store is physically using paywave or insertAll still be coded as online transactions,btohqsg
How about setting spending limits on your CC?,btohqsg
Yes  you can set limit  but say you set 1k  you still lose 1k from fraud. Better to have both precaution I feel.,btohqsg
I tried with Citi  seems like they don‚Äôt support this feature as well,btohqsg
I think can just lock the overseas purchase and just enable the in store purchases,btohqsg
Yeah this is the best way for nowOnly enable instore purchase and disable online transaction since you are only using CRMC + amaze for the purpose of changing it to online and if online might as well use citi directly unless buying stuff then temp open then closed after finish purchase,btohqsg
amaze gives additional 1% cashback though  right?,btohqsg
Only on foreign currency transactions. Plus they use their own exchange rate which is ~1% from mid market rates,btohqsg
I see  thanks. When overseas  do you guys use Instarem Amaze?,btohqsg
Im frequest shopping groceries in jb using amaze,btohqsg

Does amaze change sp services bill payment into online spending?,btohqsg
Ouch. Now that grab axs is disabled and grab top-up absolute card is 0.3% is there any good way to pay sp bills?,btohqsg
Excluded MCC take priority then check if it online or offline,btohqsg
Some credit cards have cashback for recurring utilities payment like OCBC365 and UOB one and UOB Evol  but have minimum spendOtherwise  I think SP accepts AMEX iirc  can just pay direct w UOB absolute or Amex TCB directly mah,btohqsg
Silly me.. I keep thinking of amaze card. Forget I can just use absolute card directly lol,btohqsg
=) yes yes  telcos and utilities are okay to pay without axs iirc (not too sure about the various electricity providers)its usually insurance and tax and town council payments that are more problematic,btohqsg
any of u pay condo mcst bills using credit card?,btohqsg
I tried  axs mobile or desktop can't use amex absolute card :(,btohqsg
i tried to add the credit card number in on the mobile  but it only caters to 16 number credit cards. On desktop  there is no option for amex cards  when i tried uob cards  it doesnt caters to 15 credit cards number for absolute card,btohqsg
O.o very strange  i have linked my amex tcb for payment on the SP appcant rmbr how i do it but it is there still on the appamex should be can for SP payment,btohqsg
