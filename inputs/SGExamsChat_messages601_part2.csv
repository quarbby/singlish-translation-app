i transferred to kong hwa after p2,btohqsg
but then it turned out to be like a stereotype,btohqsg
At least I'm not the one that feels liddat,btohqsg
Isn't that why they now have the subject thing,btohqsg
ngl the new system feels like what our parents gen had,btohqsg
streaming at that age is just stupid,btohqsg
Like ppl from NA can take this subj with exp ppl,btohqsg
they are trying to change it,btohqsg
but then the situation will stay the same,btohqsg
the system is shaped such that majority of ppl will still go to exprsss,btohqsg
i was p3 when em3 was scrapped,btohqsg
Overwhelming tbh  it's one of the biggest life-changing decision,btohqsg
If the sg population is spread more evenly amongst the 3 streams,btohqsg
that’s why im trying to get my sister to get promoted to express,btohqsg
the new psle scoring system like worse breh,btohqsg
like if theres equal no of ppl in exp na and nt,btohqsg
i mean for me imo it’s horrible,btohqsg
I was scared that I would fail and retain,btohqsg
I find that more for the sec4-5 ppl,btohqsg
most of my friends are from exp,btohqsg
because personally i don’t like the NA ppl,btohqsg
Ngl I find it weird that they don't give NA such combi choices,btohqsg
well one advice from me is to go to pfp in NA,btohqsg
if you wanna take the easy way out,btohqsg
well at least I am going pfp,btohqsg
Maybe my na batch still immature and not serious that time cause p6- sec 1 ma,btohqsg
the reason why they discourage them to not go sec 5 is bcos NA ppl in general are too lazy,btohqsg
so EM1 / 2 / 3,btohqsg
I was oddly the outcast LOL,btohqsg
it’s true LOL  im from NA and the ppl who fail in my class are lazy,btohqsg
just wantes to remind u that u are,btohqsg
if you actually fail in NA it’s a major skill issue,btohqsg
I was sec 1 in 2017,btohqsg
i wonder if he go jail,btohqsg
anyone got kurt tay update grp link,btohqsg
"They don't even try lol and if they did  they can easily uk perhaps ""compete"" with the express ppl",btohqsg
I only did that after pri sch,btohqsg
looking back hor i wish i didn’t slack in lower sec,btohqsg
because i could have actually got promoted to exp if i worked harder,btohqsg
i barely studied and my overall percentage was 60+%,btohqsg
I think mine was 50+ lol,btohqsg
i lucked my way to express,btohqsg
I did for appeal to trip sci,btohqsg
""" transferred exp just to get into trip sci""",btohqsg
ik ppl who studied way harder than me for psle and did like not as well,btohqsg
My dad was supposed to write the letter but he left that task to me,btohqsg
I tried to play the parents sympathy empathy move,btohqsg
My appeal was rejected at first,btohqsg
just feels bad lol seeing how it is,btohqsg
I heard there's ppl who dropped from exp to na tho,btohqsg
