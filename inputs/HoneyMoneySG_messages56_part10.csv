Because now i am using my amaze card for local spend in SG  i notice when i took the public transport  the amaze card only charged $0.10 per trip,btohqsg

Does xnap app allow us earn cc point on payment for hawker food? I saw one YouTube video say so but that was few months video,btohqsg
Do u all encounter this issue when trying to open gxs account? My mobile is not jailbroken...,btohqsg

I have a few ideas- Make sure your app is downloaded from Google Play- Make sure your phone has a screen lock,btohqsg
I just started using my lady‚Äôs card (with dining as bonus category) together with Xnap. It should be able to capture the bonus miles right?,btohqsg

I have dual sim card  but have deactivated the 2nd sim card already.My phone is samsung galaxy S22 ultra,btohqsg

What if my payment due date is 17 Aug?,btohqsg
I maxed out both WWMC and Citi Rewards  so I should use Citi Prestige to purchase the onlune air ticket,btohqsg
Thise are my three main cards,btohqsg
due date nothing to do with cap,btohqsg

"One other way is to check Play Integrity to see if your phone is actually ""clean"" (aka not rooted/etc) using this app:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gr.nikolasspyr.integritycheckIt should give you 3 ticks.",btohqsg
Lady‚Äôs card is 1k on one category.Solitaire is 3k on two categories.U can google reviews about the cards.,btohqsg
Definitely  as long as you earn 120k/yr,btohqsg
Strange eh. The last resort is do a full wipe on your phone.,btohqsg
What phone is it? Maybe Android version too old?,btohqsg
