most financial institutions won't publish the spread. you just have to compare rates across FI to know which is a better deal,btohqsg
after converted  700 missing arnd thr,btohqsg
missing when compared against? google rate?,btohqsg
topped up 100k  after conversion  sgd left 99300+,btohqsg
that's the spread. FI earns that. its common. so you top up SGD100K  convert to USD  then convert back SGD again.,btohqsg
you enter the same numbers in DBS website  you will see what's your ending SGD,btohqsg
so after i converted bck sgd  ill be bck at 100k again? dosent make sense,btohqsg
each currency conversion will have money eaten away. do you know how it works? it is like money changer counters,btohqsg
damn   it‚Äôs a lot  if i change 300k  it‚Äôs 1.8 k gone,btohqsg
why would you convert FX at a non FX trading broker...,btohqsg
the best broker to change FX in my opinion is Interactive Brokers... USD2 fee and their bid/ask spread is very competitive,btohqsg
and needless to say..  NEVER do FX transactions (small tens of dollars ok la) at retail banks,btohqsg
3% p.a. for the first 10k.,btohqsg
Just curious what‚Äôs your purpose of converting SGD to USD?,btohqsg
thanks for the prompt...my last 2 x $30 NTUC QR Codes still haven't used yet.. hahahaha,btohqsg
Yes same with me too.. never display my balance also,btohqsg
Lol that's cheaper. Try traditional banks  2-3% instead.,btohqsg
"anybody knows how does CPF pay interest? and how they charge the accured interest?From my understanding and FAQ on website1) CPF interest calculated based on following function =min(opening bal start of month  closing bal end of month)so assume if you are new  and assume Jan (first month of year) your opening bal at start of month = $0  but employer give you CPF contribution (say $100) at 14th of month  so by end of month you have $100 at end of month.But interest for Jan = $0 if follow the function as above.so interst whether 2.5%  4.08% etc will be recoreded for the prevailing 11 months as simple interest computation and pay out on 31st Dec of the year.Normally... even banks or FI will work on the fact that the interest will be computed back  eg...Jan int = $1  then principal for Feb will be +$1  then principal for Mar will be +$2 so on and so forth.... so not really clear how CPF compute interest if they disbursed out annually.So leads me to point (2) on Accured Interest.2) CPF website states  monies are charged interest from the moment we withdraw  either for Education or Housing  because the money is suppose to be there to ""earn"" the interest in the first place.However  accrued interest is calcualted the moment you withdraw the money..Not calculated by the function =min(opening bal start of month  closing bal end of month)  and it is compunded monthly.So say if I get CPF housing grant for HDB  say $20k  the money came into my OA  in Jan  then middle of the month  the money was disbursed to pay HDB.But because the money is grant  and ""granted"" to me  it should have help ""accumulate"" interest if it was not spend...But if following the funciton of=min(opening bal start of month  closing bal end of month) The month came in mid of month  and went out before end of month  so min balance will be $0 if follow example from (1) above. So no accured interst for Jan. correcT?I asked CPF  even called and went down  they cannot answer. only tell me the system is different  and keep wrapping up their answer.If you cannot convinve  you confuse  and wrap around multiple layer of conditions  seems like it.Although interest not a lot at beginning  but its good habit to understand or be transparent how the accured is calcualted.When you borrow money from FI or banks  the T&C and monthl statement will show you P + I clearly Any experts got answer?",btohqsg
Eh i thot its based on daily balance,btohqsg
Saving account just like any other bank (gxs  trust  etc),btohqsg
This can't be the case  because CPF website states that monies deposited into CPF accounts only start earning interest in the following month.,btohqsg
1. It's very clear cut. Every month CPF computes with the lowest amount after withdrawals and before deposits. So any deposited amounts will start earning interest on the following month  any withdrawn amounts will lose interest from that month itself. On the last day of the year  they will add up all the interest that was previously computed for each month including Dec.Example:To simplify  we'll just assume other policies don't exist.You just started working in Jan 24 and have $0 in your OA. Your pay comes in for Jan 24 and your contribution to OA is $100. Your lowest amount for Jan 24 is $0  so interest computed is $0. OA: $100.Contribution to OA for Feb 24 is another $100. Your lowest amount for Feb 24 is $100  interest computed is $0.20 at 2.5% p.a. OA: $200.Contribution for OA for Mar 24 is another $100  but you withdraw $100 for HDB. Your lowest amount of Mar 24 is $100  interest computed is $0.21 at 2.5% p.a. OA: $200.You lost your job and did not contribute till end Dec 24. Last day of the year they will add up all your computed interest altogether  $0 + $0.20 + $0.21 + $0.20 + ... + $0.20 + $0.21  you'll get $2.26. Your end amounts would be $202.26 in OA.2. Taking the example above  the $100 withdrawn for HDB WILL lose interest from Mar 24 onwards. Which means the accrued interest after factoring in Dec 24 would be $2.06. You would have owed $102.06 in total to your OA.Addition of grants to the example:To simplify  let's say you received and withdrawn $100 in HDB grants in Mar 24.Your new lowest amount in Mar 24 is $0. Interest computed will be $0. OA: $200.Your computed accrued interest will instead be calculated at 2.5% p.a. for the $200 in Mar 24  which is $4.16. So you'll owe $204.16 in total to your OA.And your end amounts in OA would be $202.05 instead of $202.26.,btohqsg
Yes  it is as stated in the cpf website. Interest is earned on the lowest balance of the month. If the lowest balance of the month is $100k  then u earn interest on the 100k. It dosnt matter if u have $5mil inside cpf for 1 day  it still earn interest on the 100k.,btohqsg
So based on your calculation. You calculated CPF gave you less interest or overcharge u on accrued interest?,btohqsg
The computation won‚Äôt tally with CPF‚Äôs if the concept is not aligned..,btohqsg
Hi Melvyn  thank you for the detail summary.Can i check how you derive $0.20 for the $100 sitting in Feb? should use 11/12 or by days? xx/365?,btohqsg
we all would like monies to be given higher rates  or compounded more regularly. GXS awards (and disburse) interest daily. major banks does it monthly. CPF does it annually. but who's got the risk-free rate and who doesn't? That's also key to remember...,btohqsg
29 days in Feb 24  366 days in year 2024,btohqsg
the easiest way to check will be SA  so far money in no money out. can tally between the years also (Y),btohqsg
Hope it tallies out for you.,btohqsg
@EweeeKCPF may just divide by 12 instead also  since it's computed monthly. But who knows? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg

After rinsing and washing the towel once  the towel still full of lint. Yoga pants and sweatpants quality are all damn subpar  way worst than singapore decathlon or uniqlo equivalent.,btohqsg
Wah. Really? Tks for tat info,btohqsg
idk about target. Its not doing as well compared to Kmart  as it is always empty. Slightly more pricier and less variety compared to kmart.,btohqsg
Kmart has like a dropshipping model  so their catalogue change very often one. That's why I think the QC of their product vary  cuz they don't produce most of their product directly.,btohqsg
I think chemist warehouse is most worth in Australia haha. The perfume and health product damn cheap  can really close eyes and buy.,btohqsg
