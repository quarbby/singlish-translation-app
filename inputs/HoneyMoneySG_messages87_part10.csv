Butt if u stack uob one & evol wil. U still get cashback? If u dint spent 600 on Evol,btohqsg
Hi all  wanted to ask if Citi Reward will be considered online pay if paid by Apple Pay? Or is there any alternative! Thank you!!,btohqsg
Back to the main question  what does the tnc say? üòâConsidering you asked the same qn 3 times  doubt you actually have read it. So here's a quick extract for you:1. UOB One account bonus interest: $500 total spend on eligible cards2. UOB EVOL card cashback: $600 total eligible spend3. UOB One card cashback: $500 / $1000 / $2000 total eligible spend,btohqsg
Hi all  UOB PPV for Xnap can earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
What does the TNC say? Have you tried checkingheymax.ai?,btohqsg
I read somewhere saying xnap is mobile in-app payment. So is it considered online txn?,btohqsg
Hi all  if you're planning to invite others into this group  please give them the invite link (t.me/HoneyMoneySGor@HoneyMoneySG) so that they will see and respond to the captcha üôèüèª,btohqsg
Not sure if im reading it correctly but ppv is for mobile contactless and online spend. So xnap dosent fall into both categories?,btohqsg
Right. So other payments via online payment methods are considered online spending.,btohqsg
Wdym? My question is whether xnap considered online? I dont think my question has been answered,btohqsg
XNAP is an online payment method lol,btohqsg
But why is CRMC on Xnap not awarded bonus points?,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúXnap crmc‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
does anyone got experience dealing in structure certificate launch by sgx?,btohqsg
The tnc spelt the exclusions out quite clearly,btohqsg
I am here asking my questions bcos i still dont understand the tnc. If u are here to be sarcastic then u might as well stay quiet,btohqsg
Can someone explain me if this is correct.According to shell website and UOB web  it stats that for UOB One card customer  we are entitled up to 17% upfront discountAka:5% station discount5% shell member discount7% UOB One Card discountBut according to the receipt it‚Äôs only 14%Am I misunderstanding something here,btohqsg
Additional of 5% if we hit the 2000 monthly spend but I understand that isn‚Äôt reflected over here,btohqsg
anyone knows if i cant get annual fee waiver for dbs/uob  can i simply cancel and stop using their miles card with no penalty and just transfer all miles out? cos i heard before sometimes they would take your UNI$/dbsmiles if you dont pay annual fee,btohqsg
Kinda ironic lol  people answered your question clearly,btohqsg
I think coz the cashback only in place if there‚Äôs a spend of 2000 and min 5 transaction  so it wouldn‚Äôt have appeared in the receipt I guess,btohqsg
You used the UOB One card to pay right?,btohqsg
No I‚Äôm not referring to the 5% rebate from one card itself.  I‚Äôm just talking about the 17% purely,btohqsg
UOB One card should get 17% upfront discount  based on both UOB One and Shell website.,btohqsg
Ohh oops read it wrongly üòÖ,btohqsg
"fyi  he was indeed sarcastic at first and only answered my doubt later on.Imagine having every question sent here and such people answer ""check the tnc"" and ""read prev msg"" LOL",btohqsg
That‚Äôs what I tot so too. Do you think that‚Äôs a mistake or?,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs already answered previously  I don‚Äôt see the issue with saying that. Plus they were nice enough to even tell you the keywords to search for or even give the message link to click. Your response wasn‚Äôt nice either by saying ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù lol,btohqsg
Don't even see a 9% on tnc... But somehow they gave a 9% discount?,btohqsg
in the first place‚Ä¶ a simple search ‚Äúppv xnap‚Äù would have given u ur answer immediately - i saw u asked the same question on wed and it went unanswered  so you‚Äôd rather wait 4 days for someone here to reply rather than find out yourself?,btohqsg
If people willing to help themselves they will. üò¨ Something simple as reading tnc also refuse to do so  can't expect much. ü§™,btohqsg
Think should call up the bank and ask,btohqsg
XNAP uses Apple Pay. Apple Pay is excluded by CRCM. There‚Äôs physical and online Apple Pay,btohqsg
Like what samsam said  can check with bank if there's any undocumented changes to the discount ü§îDid you show your Shell GO+ digital membership?,btohqsg
Maybe a new nerf that they haven‚Äôt update üò±,btohqsg
Maybe a buff also. Originally 7% UOB One card instant discount  now is 9%?Then the remaining 5% come from Shell GO+ membership presented upon payment.Which means upfront 5% (Shell canopy discount) + 9% (UOB One discount) + 5% (Shell GO+ membership discount). Then 5% cashback if hit 2k tier.,btohqsg
"I did search before but ""Xnap PPV"" only has 6 search results and only 1 person has confirmed so. And 4 of which coming from me. So why cant i ask to double cfm?",btohqsg
So it comes down to if@Zora_Apshown his Shell GO+ membership upon payment..,btohqsg
Oh shell canopy means 5% shall station discount?,btohqsg
Yup correct. Shell GO+ membership used to be Shell Escape member.,btohqsg
Maybe check on Shell Asia app if they gave you points instead now.. if not the fault lies with Shell themselves already,btohqsg
Anyone here managed to get the ichange physical card? They say delivery to me using city link express 3 weeks ago.... Until now not here....,btohqsg
I believe they thought I was not using a uob one card ??,btohqsg
Think you're too scared of annual fees.If they charge annual fee  try to get it waived. If they don't want to  cancel it. (Sometimes they even give u an incentive to keep)You have some time (about 3 weeks maybe) after the af is charged to decide to cancel it. Then take your time to transfer out everything and cancel as needed.You're the customer. Don't need to be scared of the cards that want/need you as customer. If they can't give you what you want  say bye.,btohqsg
There is a chance other UOB card gives a total of 14%,btohqsg
I recall the shell payment terminal can auto detect your type of card. No need cashier to choose / key in,btohqsg
Maybe also but unlikely.Theory is that the Shell GO+ membership discount should be a separate line item.. what if you're not paying with UOB card but have Shell GO+ membership?,btohqsg
Hi experts need your opinion  if I spend about 2 000 plus a month  should I opt for UOB 2 000 tier or split between UOB one card and UOB Evol to maximise cash back? Thank you!,btohqsg
To add  nobody actually knows the threshold of approving the annual fee waiver. Can't know for sure whether you'll get it or not.One thing for sure is that if they charged you annual fee and you decided to cancel the card  they're obliged to return you the annual fee. Within a reasonable timeframe of course. Usually within 4 weeks of charging AF but to be safe make it 3 weeks,btohqsg
We have the scan the go+ qr code,btohqsg
