Of course comparing engines and gearbox  his Q60 faster in speed.,btohqsg
But accel depends on the launch. In ideal conditions  my members S4 can beat him to 100kph but in practise  we all dun have our cars and bikes in Launch mode every red light. üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Mana si chomel ngn si suare abg2,btohqsg
Soranext time kau dapat class 3 import this Daihatsu,btohqsg
Somewhat but to be precise is a Daihatsu Mira Gino,btohqsg
but I just think perodua underated,btohqsg
Luckily the white BMW not the TP BMW,btohqsg
Imagine a few of us buying these and then we bring to Sepang. Like a kapcai car one make series,btohqsg
Also good thing is if go Malaysia have a lot of parts and like there is very little risk of it getting stolen,btohqsg
This is one ugly fked up grille,btohqsg
No lah still in bed lepakking,btohqsg
He put the big Logo on the grille,btohqsg
bro I wanna leave south spine but the Rain like and off,btohqsg
Like why the fk you put the emblem and then still keep the damn standing logo.. and for this generation big emblem is ugly siol,btohqsg
Even can bring to Thailand cus they have a Mira Club there,btohqsg
Stopped raining at NTU side alr what..?,btohqsg
Perodua Kelisa converted to Mira Gino front end,btohqsg
But Kelisa I think they put 1.0L engine instead of the Mira Gino 660cc engine,btohqsg
The process like this. They make a Daihatsu Mira Gino and a Mira Gino 1000  the Gino 1000 export over to Perodua in Msia and then they put the Kelisa face and badges,btohqsg
Gino 1000 is for those ppl that want the small size of the Mira Gino but need bigger engine.,btohqsg
Problem is if want to import  need a car that is manufactured after June 2003,btohqsg
Or may need to put classic plate on it,btohqsg
Mayb the standing logo so small he wna tell ppl he drive a merc,btohqsg
He cfm have something to compensate for..,btohqsg

alright guys so i jst discussed with carros: though they are willing to host and allow the rooftop to be open for us theres a few concerns i and they have,btohqsg
1. the revving  burnouts and all that is a NOGO. if not  i kena held accountable la basically,btohqsg
they said all that for seah im also lol,btohqsg
2. if we set a limit for cars to come  and other ppl join the meet past limit,btohqsg
Just trust some stupid slow car to go and pop and bang and ruin the meet lor,btohqsg
3. building management dowan spotters to run ard chasingn cars to record and shit,btohqsg
4. pretty much common sense stuff la: dont drift and cost damage all ya,btohqsg
so if im gna continue with this meet then i will be setting it to a private one and ill only solely invite ppl i trust,btohqsg
U rlly think ppl gonna comply?,btohqsg
cfm will have 1 person wont comply,btohqsg
Almost all the meets i go to says no pops and bangs,btohqsg
Theres gonna be tat crowd whos like EH REV REV,btohqsg
Its almost impossible to make a car meet wif no revs n shit,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry just trust one huge YP crowd and blue card crowd come and encourage pop and rev and whatnot,btohqsg
If like die2 strict liddat idt anyone wld come,btohqsg
but i blue card eh üò≠,btohqsg
i mean those that proper i can invite la,btohqsg
Tats quite sad doe for some ppl who legit just wanna see cars,btohqsg
If ppl rev and pop then u go Key their car,btohqsg
simple example of what they dowan is: the kallang meet,btohqsg
A lot of them just go cus wow car make loud noise,btohqsg
They all just go with trend,btohqsg
might just make it private  and for the invite to the meet for spotters i see first,btohqsg
Some of dem are quite passionate abt cars doe and admit it. The sounds are related to what makes a car sexy too,btohqsg
Not saying that all yp are retarded,btohqsg
But there will always be ppl gate crashing,btohqsg
So how do U intend to host meet,btohqsg
Ive hosted a lot of bike rides,btohqsg
stupid ppl do stupid things at meet,btohqsg
thats why i discuss with yall first,btohqsg
All of dem slalu ade ppl cmg in uninvited,btohqsg
like the street addict meet lor,btohqsg
TLDR: i jst talked to carros representative abt having a meet thr,btohqsg
Unless u make like very private or whatever,btohqsg
say no rev all then at last have,btohqsg
oh someone would probably wld try to take over the meet,btohqsg
and then what did they say,btohqsg
now i talking abt what they dont want us to do AT ALL and the risks given,btohqsg
A meet w/o revs honestly kinda boring if u ask me ah,btohqsg
idt y‚Äôall should put at carros,btohqsg
