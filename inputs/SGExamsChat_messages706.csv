i mean its not like he committed crime or anything,btohqsg
and the way he talks about pw its like he genuinely believes its gd,btohqsg
teens what they will usually rebel against their parents and listen to others,btohqsg
Actl in his lecture slides he used a baby to adult cartoon to illustrate the evolution of pw,btohqsg
So@kohsyansaying pw is his kid actl not that far off,btohqsg
Oh exactly because jascelyn koh wasnt a name that exists back during my mi days,btohqsg
Was mr ang there back in your days?,btohqsg
that means you were around the mukun batch around there,btohqsg
Guys any of y'all follow your teachers on Instagram,btohqsg
sec sch teachers yes  but pre U  no,btohqsg
Damn I follow none  the only teacher I have is a poly one,btohqsg
https://twitter.com/Stone_tossers/status/1767988622031208901?t=tb5635km4V-0TIiqGhdY7w&s=19nahhhh stone toss at it again,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA about the cher that helped to create pw  by the time his kid take pw it would be a pass/fail  no more A  B  C  D  E,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt need care about bio!!,btohqsg
why would you take H1 bio anyway,btohqsg
not worth it for the amount of content you have to memorise,btohqsg
but she teaches damn slow cause she wants to make sure that the entire class can understand,btohqsg
and I feel it's not really the individual teaching in mi thats bad for chem but more of the department as a whole,btohqsg
for example there's still no chem revision package yet but we alr have one for both bio and math,btohqsg
and it's been like that for all the years,btohqsg
CMEb not like bio matters anyways alr,btohqsg
tbh I think econs or math are the best H1 subjects,btohqsg
but now it doesn't matter so,btohqsg
just take the one you are most interested in,btohqsg
CMEb is still sci i thought,btohqsg
H1 history is just O level history buffed,btohqsg
true but you need to take o lvl history for it,btohqsg
whr ur guys think best bak kwa ah  now after cny period shld be abit cheaper,btohqsg
I thought they weren‚Äôt very similar,btohqsg
Only some of the content overlaps,btohqsg
If yes who said taking o level history is a prerequisite to take h1 or h2 history,btohqsg
i think h1 history strong focus on cold war,btohqsg
still waiting for the vietnam war to become part of the o level history syllabus,btohqsg
For ALL arts subjects in every JC  there is no prerequisite where students must have offered the subject at o level,btohqsg
oh is it? i suibian say only,btohqsg
depends on your econs dpt üíÄ,btohqsg
O did anyone ask u to talk,btohqsg
grandbaby i didn't ask you to answer,btohqsg
Ik someone who taking H2 geog now,btohqsg
I thought it is according to syllabus doc,btohqsg
arts subject not rly strict on prereq i think,btohqsg
In case my future uni course needs h2 math,btohqsg
grandbabygoescrazyüí•üí•did you finish the redox qn alr,btohqsg
i threw the whole ws away,btohqsg
bro has beef with the worksheet,btohqsg
that is pure  i meant combined humans,btohqsg
i have beef with my maths tutorial :D,btohqsg
I CANNOT DO THE LAST QN,btohqsg
or rather has anyone answered your qn,btohqsg
ask yt maybe he‚Äôd be helpful for once,btohqsg
i alr finished the qn i sent,btohqsg
that bitch doesn't talk anymore ever since he doxxed me,btohqsg
it's ok maths is difficult for everyone,btohqsg
bro casually doxxed my name and said it was nothing special,btohqsg
yt no longer owner i tot,btohqsg
the first ever graph i ever made was written from the top to the bottom..like a huge S,btohqsg
did not realise graphs were suppose to be from left to right,btohqsg
yt also doxxed me bfr but since he‚Äôs such a nice human being he deleted it on command,btohqsg
How did he even find out your details,btohqsg
bro stopped talking after that msg,btohqsg
meanwhile in discord if you breathe: BAN BAN BAN,btohqsg
Can hire him if need to do some stalking at this point,btohqsg
bro is NOT the organic chem tutor üò≠üòû,btohqsg
who want to talk to u,btohqsg
bc who want to talk to u,btohqsg
ur finger got problem I swear,btohqsg
My econs teacher teach pw too and told the class ‚Äòi wun say u are my student if u dun get A‚Äô,btohqsg
shouldnt it be double a instead,btohqsg
Whats the point of pw then if everyone gets A,btohqsg
i am just trying to correct the spelling,btohqsg
what is malay looking chindian üî•üî•üî•,btohqsg
The only arts subj with prereq are the Chinese related ones/MTLL and ELL  and maybe Art/Music (can take w/o taking at O level though),btohqsg
but they don‚Äôt call it pw,btohqsg
Oh ya forgot about those. My bad. But stuff like geog history lit confirm don‚Äôt have,btohqsg
so maybe I abit malay idk,btohqsg
the number of bristles on a paintbrush,btohqsg
ah maybe thats explains why you look malay,btohqsg
Isok haha  those subjects are quite niche also,btohqsg
And yea the big 3 geog hist elit dont have prereqs,btohqsg
grandpa from malaysia  dad indian  mum chinese,btohqsg
R u being discriminating saying msia only got malay?,btohqsg
If im not wrong they will ask you to draw smth ? but idk,btohqsg
I know someone who did H2 Art without doing it in the O level equivalent,btohqsg
HAHA i also want to know,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it just one parent Chinese one parent indian and your grandfather is a Chinese/Indian msia either one,btohqsg
yeah my dad‚Äôs dad was Indian Malaysian,btohqsg
not a dessert not a lunch,btohqsg
but too ex to get acai berries,btohqsg
U still take 4 but only 3 is counted,btohqsg
Actually normal for chindians to look malay,btohqsg
But seriously got classes with 100% distinction coz their cher damn good,btohqsg
H1 will only be counted if(3H2 + 1H1 + GP)/80x 70 more than 3H2 + GP,btohqsg
what happens if they score well for both h1 and mother tongue,btohqsg
Did a google search  apparently yes,btohqsg
I thought only rebased if your score improves the rp,btohqsg
Cuz the current one if h1 mt also improve the score it will be rebased fr 100 to 90,btohqsg
I mean yes it‚Äôs calculated like that  but if all your subjects do relatively well  the rebased score will be lower than the 70rp 4 subj score,btohqsg
Is only rebase if it make ur score btr,btohqsg
I think if it only improves the rank points then rebase,btohqsg
Im not sure if it is just h1 sci or what but apparently ppl tend to do better in their h2s lol,btohqsg
Yes but u need to calculate urself,btohqsg
like ppl do better for h2 sci?,btohqsg
No i meant ppl tend to do better in their h2s relative to h1s,btohqsg
and h1 lesson time lesser also,btohqsg
yeah but im sadly still in 90rp system,btohqsg
maybe that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt see it as important,btohqsg
I prefer none of the system,btohqsg
I want 3H2 and 1H1 and GP lol  then pw pass/fail,btohqsg
Or even better  make gp pass fail,btohqsg
even better  make all subjects pass/fail,btohqsg
Help‚Ä¶how does that work‚Ä¶everyone will just hv passes,btohqsg
then everyone will have equal chances of getting what they want,btohqsg
this year there was this MI senior who has straight Us,btohqsg
Should‚Äôve gone poly from the start,btohqsg
This one rlly no joke one,btohqsg
someone making a fool of you,btohqsg
But I thought if the subject fail it won‚Äôt be shown on the result slip,btohqsg
So can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs S or U,btohqsg
so he got the unofficial results slip instead,btohqsg
bro he stayed for 5 years i think,btohqsg
wait do I know the guy,btohqsg
ik someone who repeated a year in MI,btohqsg
Ik someone who spent 4 years in ej,btohqsg
And I thought 3 years in ite was bad,btohqsg
Well  it is still pretty bad but...,btohqsg
3 years in ite is normal,btohqsg
It's literally 3 yr hnitec+poly = 6years,btohqsg
ya youre allowed to retain once per level,btohqsg
but some have to do 7,btohqsg
But I thought nitec can go poly if gpa high enuf,btohqsg
So ej also allows one to retain once per level? Or is it that person retain once then come back ej retake,btohqsg
but not twice for the same level,btohqsg
Thst ej recommended him to not take the paper,btohqsg
Wow at least they allowed him to retain once per level,btohqsg
Tgt with students who just skip a levels,btohqsg
‚Äúnah you‚Äôre gonna get cooked just retain‚Äù,btohqsg
I think in Acjc cannot retain twice for J1,btohqsg
Only way of getting 4 years is to retake as J3 after retaining onceNvm after thinking about it I realised it‚Äôs basically retaining once per level,btohqsg
at least for you is shorter,btohqsg
still shorter than going ite then poly,btohqsg
lol I‚Äôm christian but idk why people are like that,btohqsg
it's a pretty stupid method of evangelism,btohqsg
doesn't work in singapore at all,btohqsg
keep telling that to people in my church and outside but they don't seem to be interested in listening üòê,btohqsg
There is result slip and cert  I think everything will still be on result slip  just no cert,btohqsg
I hate both extreme christians and extreme atheists,btohqsg
and extreme of any religion tbh,btohqsg
Today is an extremely unproductive day for me  I just can‚Äôt process anything,btohqsg
as long as they don‚Äôt tell me everything science related is bc of god,btohqsg
do wtv the fuck you want,btohqsg
just don‚Äôt make it my problem,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt support but I don‚Äôt immediately say to someone ‚Äúoh the devil is gonna capture you‚Äù,btohqsg
i mean in general with these sorts of things is just don‚Äôt make it my business,btohqsg
I have friends who are lgbtq who respect my religion,btohqsg
i‚Äôll care when i have a reason to,btohqsg
i mean i just support people in believing and doing what they want to,btohqsg
but there‚Äôs certain points where belief and logic clash,btohqsg
like the science thing is a point where i draw the line lol,btohqsg
I only explain when they wanna know,btohqsg
like trying to force others to accept lgbtq is no diff from people trying to force religion onto others,btohqsg
imo i feel like not everyone has to support but just dont attack ppl for existing,btohqsg
if you dl then just dont interact with them and dont talk to them ever,btohqsg
i mean there‚Äôs a line between supporting and tolerance,btohqsg
but just internalise the concept of the world doesn‚Äôt revolve around you,btohqsg
i wanna buy a small carrot plush for my bunny,btohqsg
so she has a mini treato,btohqsg
bc god respects your free will so much that he allowed you to freely choose,btohqsg
did you know that carrots are basically drugs for rabbits,btohqsg
yea actl its btr for rabbits to eat lettuce,btohqsg
Happy Pi day to all ! üòÅ,btohqsg
why the username going off the reactions,btohqsg
idk what my sis did in school but got these 3 people (i forgot what my sis did to trigger them and kick start the bullying) who call her homophobic and announce to the whole world,btohqsg
i just rmb in sec school  one of my classmates sole intention was to disruptclass.soclass after class  lesson after lesson. he would be disruptive...purposely scored badly in psle and decided he wanted to mess with a whole class for 2 straight years...rope in classmates to slack off and not pay attention.After he did his damage and my class became notorious  bro was found to have a iq of abt 150-170 and migrated to express in another school after 2 years.None of my classmates nor the teachers did anything or could do anything for the 2 years,btohqsg
my sis denied she did anything to give them a sign she is homophobic  but bruh wth...like u can bully by other means but by calling someone homophobic and announcing it to the whole world???,btohqsg
she complaining about her school nonstop then she wanted to transfer out but end up not doing so coz she said she got the subject combi she wanted,btohqsg
yea...actually my mum first reaction was to ask her what she did that told them she may be homophobic  i wun be surprised if she actually did something,btohqsg
but afterall they were 14 so u can expect 14y/o act,btohqsg
first time hearing people purposely do shit???,btohqsg
i think ive said this story in this channel before way back...but yea  i was sec 1  and at sec 3..when he left  That was a very eye opening experience for me. To know that how unfair this world could be.In just the 3 years from2017-2020..when i ended sec 3  i saw a class and cohort caning in 2 separate years...all the participants were from the same exact group that one guy formed in my class for that 2 years,btohqsg
it is new thing to me  i cant imagine why would anyone do that if he is capable of doing well and get it over and done w in one setting,btohqsg
its a thing  students have been known to do during psle,btohqsg
wait like the whole class got caning???,btohqsg
he just formed a group of slackers/trouble makers..majority from my class and roped in some others from other classes. He was rich  he was smart. That was the nail in the coffin.,btohqsg
the form teacher that took us relayed the info,btohqsg
wah so all of them got into disciplinary issues ah,btohqsg
i doubted it until he transferred to a express stream in monfort,btohqsg
then his iq is not matching his actions,btohqsg
he was a normal academic student in my neighbourhood school,btohqsg
so he decided that it is enough of trouble making,btohqsg
so everyone that he roped in got caned?,btohqsg
he was the same guy that got canned in class for stealing from public convenience stores,btohqsg
wait why is this a school matter,btohqsg
i mean if you can doubt his iq..but idk how you can doubt his eq,btohqsg
this was some 100iq brain move..or basically destructive behaviour ive first encountered in my life,btohqsg
good for him ur school did not do public caning,btohqsg
some school spank in the hall during assembly,btohqsg
oh then the following year  public canning happened to 3 of his friends..for posting on social media about them throwing wet tissue in toilet ceilings,btohqsg
wah so he lucky caned in class  then his friends spanked in front of the cohort,btohqsg
but stealing is more serious tho,btohqsg
wait just posting that video resulted in caning,btohqsg
actually i dunno why public stealing the school is involved,btohqsg
like wun it be the police,btohqsg
could be... but then again someone in my level rose from NT to express in 3 yrs,btohqsg
sec 1 was NT and sec 3 became express like a magic show you know,btohqsg
i did not even realise you can progress this fast,btohqsg
not fails but dont put in the effort to do well,btohqsg
like they could go express but instead they decide to go NA..kind of flunking im talking about,btohqsg
in primary school my dad got called to the school coz my brother and some others team up to cyberbully this irritating girl in his class,btohqsg
actually just curious does suspension come first or caning,btohqsg
yea i know this  i never heard of anybody doing the latter,btohqsg
caning shld come first then suspension,btohqsg
then that one guy that joined did the former,btohqsg
my trajectory could be biased solely because the entry of NA for my school was 160,btohqsg
this one is asking for trouble,btohqsg
that is supidly low for a NA stream class,btohqsg
my school i hv not heard of disciplinary cases,btohqsg
but i was from a girls school la,btohqsg
my bro school got someone attempted commit suicide after doing badly for a test  he just walked out and attempt to absailing down the wall lol,btohqsg
then he too scared then call for help to pull him back up,btohqsg
it was a sec 3 and during the sec 4 exam,btohqsg
Uh huh and what's your pt,btohqsg
oh yea talking about this  he never submitted any work  constantly was chased by teachers for work..slept like 60% of the time in class..but magically when it came time to prove in MYE/EOY..bro scores A and B on nearly every subject,btohqsg
Btw is there a limit on the number of posts that can be seen on Twitter,btohqsg
i think my school is ok  not toxic,btohqsg
"my cohort seems like a outlier for all these ""special"" occasions",btohqsg
ok i shall take my leave,btohqsg
Cause I just realised that I can‚Äôt see older posts from accounts,btohqsg
Even though when I go to media there are older posts,btohqsg
actually i think corporal punishments end in sec sch,btohqsg
i dun think JCs and stuff have corporal punishments,btohqsg
You do know altho it's a seldom thing to jump from NT to express rite  not saying it's impossible but sure it happens... Just.. like what kuro said it's not like it's a common occurrence where ppl would normally fail PSLE.. it's literally one of the milestones as someone who'd normally  goes thru education in sg,btohqsg
i heard apparently he got anger management issues also,btohqsg
i never meant people purposely failing psle,btohqsg
exactly 2 years ago it was out at midnight,btohqsg
but ye 6-7am is the norm,btohqsg
i didnt know someone can lateral transfer from NT to NA to express,btohqsg
lol i bet some of those people don‚Äôt even know what being homophobic really means and they‚Äôre just offended on behalf of others,btohqsg
Guys gonna go army then go poly,btohqsg
but they dont dissapear from class 80% of time  are not trouble makers..dont get disciplinary actions like almost every other week.,btohqsg
i think they also trying to find reasons to cook up something against my sis,btohqsg
NT to NA is easy no?,btohqsg
It's damn XIONG and I can only imagine because as you'd know   it's alrd a big ass jump to NA and then from NA to exp is another jump,btohqsg
it's NA to express that's difficult,btohqsg
it is what it is. dumb is dumb,btohqsg
like almost every cohort has someone going from NT to NA,btohqsg
I heard SP is hell bahahaha,btohqsg
yea but for this guy  he did also became disruptive..to the point  there were teachers that basically did not turn up for lessons..and we had to do self studying for those lessons,btohqsg
lol nobody gets transferred in sec 4,btohqsg
SP have but with psychology I did the aptitude test super hard,btohqsg
Then is mass comm leh which poly,btohqsg
RP like shag eh must do RJ madam,btohqsg
Ok from what I've heard it's harder if let's say you're set on transferring sec 2NA to sec 3exp... I mean ngl for me I transferred when I was sec 1 and ngl I must admit I find NA too slow and exp too fast for me,btohqsg
failed because i did not write 20 words,btohqsg
Uhmm RP must do RJ very mafan,btohqsg
lol this i rmb being shown this a lot,btohqsg
NP good uh like facilities and environment,btohqsg
But is RJ a big component?,btohqsg
Overall which poly yall think is the best concussive environment,btohqsg
i honestly think the only selling point of rp is the ease of progress,btohqsg
no shit  cause they need ppl,btohqsg
which is not a selling point tbh,btohqsg
literally 1/2 the classes in my school are empty,btohqsg
Like got give opportunity to go overseas and all?,btohqsg
like its figuratively easier to get a higher gpa depending on how you learn,btohqsg
you can be a gpa 1.8 in one sem and a gpa of 2.6 in the next,btohqsg
"""plagarism score"" is there for a reason",btohqsg
the most wtf part is..you barely pass all your 5 main modules  your gpa 1.4,btohqsg
Your campus is already the smallest,btohqsg
And y‚Äôall still are so empty,btohqsg
how did she catch up w the sec 1-3 NA stuff sia,btohqsg
i did not know you could fail rj lolz,btohqsg
The food nice not and the lectures helpful?,btohqsg
now i know you can only fail specific rjs,btohqsg
Cause big jump for me I heard poly different ocean from ITE,btohqsg
ITE east is so far east,btohqsg
"3 canteens  1 cafe  1 starbucks all within premises of rp.food average around 4-6  a few good stalls  lecturers are ""partimers""...""cant contact after 6""  ""dont reply to msteams/outlook during non schooling hrs""",btohqsg
no it actually is  majority of lecturers are literally on the clock/off the job kind of attitude. admin things also take forever because nobody wants to work overtime,btohqsg
i have classmates that been in rp for 5 years,btohqsg
5 yrs and still haven't reach y3 poly yet,btohqsg
Hmm I thought central the bets ITE,btohqsg
I see got Sheng shiong all,btohqsg
Can literally buy crab home to eat,btohqsg
just curious  do poly allow visitors?,btohqsg
West so small and always crowded,btohqsg
no rp student..tell me he purposely fail modules he know he cant do well and take other modules first..since rp got rid of the gpa cap for remodding modules,btohqsg
I wanted to go central but got rejected,btohqsg
last time in rp..if you remod  you get A..your result reflected for gpa would be Maximum B..now they got rid of it,btohqsg
True but no one actually eats there,btohqsg
They all go matrix or eco,btohqsg
so now  anybody in rp can constantly remod until they get their desired gpa,btohqsg
only criteria is you can't remod if you never fail,btohqsg
Is poly GPa the same as they grade ITE?,btohqsg
bruh i got cohort mates going to y2 sem 2 with gpa of 0.9,btohqsg
keep in mind passing all 5 main modules  your gpa is 1.4,btohqsg
going into y2 sem 1  there was a 1.1 and 0.9,btohqsg
How about SP and TP how is it like,btohqsg
And how many mods must you take in poly,btohqsg
you need to pay a fine for dropping out  so most ppl just let the school kick them out. but that also has a criteria,btohqsg
fail 2 modules 2 sem in a row.or fail 1 module 3 sem in a row,btohqsg
Man oh man ok I will think about it after I enroll in army,btohqsg
how to dropout you tell me üíÄ you rich ah,btohqsg
yea so most rp students just let the school kick them out,btohqsg
might as well go malaysia take spm english medium,btohqsg
everyday you study in rp  the more you will learn about how unique/dysfunctional rp is as a polytechnic,btohqsg
Alright thank you guys for answering my questions,btohqsg
"if you read up about how rp started..you know it was just one of those ""eureka"" moments but nobody had a vision for the school",btohqsg
I will discuss with my parents and take your viewpoints into consideration,btohqsg
fyi  the first batch of rp students was housed on a single floor of a old ministry headquarters.that should tell you about the vision of rp...practically none since the beginning,btohqsg
in rp  normally if you remod. the grade are almost always higher than the previous grades you got taking the mod. reason being that faci's in rp have to answer to higher ups for every student they fail or every student that does badly..like they have to send writeups and paperwork,btohqsg
so in most cases  faci's wont fail students,btohqsg
yes they do or at least have a majority say in the grades  thats why you can get a D in one lesson and 2 weeks later get a A...the grades that are given to you are dictated majority by faci'sIf a exam that sem1 takes has a low passing rate  the exam for the following sem2 will be made easier and vice versa  most rp modules have a bell curve and cag/exam grading is based upon these bellcurves and adjusted for the following semester,btohqsg
someone wants to know what poly they should go..and i just gave them the ultimatum to avoid rp as a choice,btohqsg
rj is not a factor in your gpa. rj is just a decision for faci's to determine whether you will drop a grade or remain in a grade that was choosen based solely on class participation and class work.So if class participation + class work would give you a B. Not doing rj meant you would be given a C..but doing it does not mean you will get a A,btohqsg
the only time any higher ups is involved is when students fail modules. every other time  grades are solely determined by faci's. that's why rp has a big issue with biased faci's,btohqsg
"yes  ive said how fucked up rp's system is before  and now and then constantly have to remind ppl about the system. you wont be the last.The stigma for rp is there for a reason  its been proved many times. that in rp. Hardwork does not pay off  just do what is given and nothing more. Unless specifically specified you will be given high grades  dont bother doing ""extra"".",btohqsg
many students around sg and even public know this alr..but what many dont know is the internal reasons..unless you are a student  you will never truly know how bad it honestly is until you see your gpa jump 1.5 pts within 2 sems,btohqsg
i mean its up to you lah  if you like to slack  rp is like heaven for you.,btohqsg
I rlly regret messing up my o lvls,btohqsg
it rlly isn't a bad school,btohqsg
but you still miss out on so much,btohqsg
https://www.instagram.com/p/C4f4CBksfEo/?igsh=dGF2MWJ0Y3hnMDg0@chemcerand whoever still serving NS  go raid your camp storerooms right now~,btohqsg
I know for tp  you can't like walk walk unless u have their student pass?? but uk at times when the gate is open ah and iirc u can just walk in and go cafeteria eat,btohqsg
TP allows you to enter whenever,btohqsg
eh isn't there like a guard,btohqsg
who sits by the entrance ( I forgot which gate),btohqsg
Then if they suspect you are an outsider they'll demand for the pass,btohqsg
But cool sia I heard the business cafeteria/canteen food are bussin,btohqsg
Idk bruh I definitely looked like an outsider and nobody troubled me,btohqsg
I‚Äôve friends who go into TP to play Pok√©mon Go,btohqsg
I just asking around but I am sry if I am irriating to u guys,btohqsg
Poly guards generally don't trouble you just for the way you dress,btohqsg
I was wearing an NP shirt,btohqsg
Yea it doesn't matter  I've seen ah ma's and ah gong's at the level 3 canteensWhere level 2 and above is restricted to only students  staff use,btohqsg
If they stopped you  you were just unlucky,btohqsg
tbh from what heard SP NP is like nus ntu,btohqsg
But just take it as a pinch of salt,btohqsg
joint poly admission exercise or something?,btohqsg
Jpae is for ite  jae is for o levels,btohqsg
ur genshin stickers are so cute,btohqsg
Is F math gonna be useful,btohqsg
depends on your definition of useful,btohqsg
And like how does calculus help in irl,btohqsg
everything can be useful but everything can also be useless,btohqsg
Take this with a grain of salt since I don't take fmath,btohqsg
But fmath  at least in the context of h2 fmath in singapore  tends to be more applied maths,btohqsg
Which is kinda like engineering math   according to my friends who do fmath,btohqsg
So i guess if you choose to go into engineering  it could be helpful?,btohqsg
But fmath isnt a prerequisite for any sg uni courses  so yeah,btohqsg
So i think let it slide,btohqsg
Most ppl take fmath out of interestOr to escape H2 chem,btohqsg
Ngl the main reason I'm taking chemistry is because of H2 Bio,btohqsg
i cant do long division either,btohqsg
the fuck if i know that,btohqsg
didnt threaten to kill myself when i got burned 1k in 2 days in investments,btohqsg
but did u keep ask how to do,btohqsg
when all u need to do is jus read,btohqsg
she was asking how to do even though there are like 5+ ppl helping her to explain,btohqsg
jus her anxiety take over beacuse her friend say she dumb for not understanding long div,btohqsg
there is a difference if u call urself dumb for fun and actually being dumb,btohqsg
idk to me if u can go jc means u quite smart rdy,btohqsg
I mean ig I was blocked too ngl,btohqsg
"It says ""last seen"" smth smth",btohqsg
That's all there is to it,btohqsg
idt the problem was the asking tbh it was like her keep saying she was stupid even though we alr told her multiple times to stop,btohqsg
is being last seen of a very long time means,btohqsg
I mean idt you were involved in the saga,btohqsg
But damn we were just trying to help her,btohqsg
Haven't exactly seen you ard here here ykwim,btohqsg
Ya cos I couldn‚Äôt rly care about teaching math lol,btohqsg
I just mainly told her to have more self confidence,btohqsg
She was asking qns here when there's another chat specifically meant for it,btohqsg
But if there is an underlying mental issue need to seek more professional help,btohqsg
Like sure a few times ok,btohqsg
But she was uk doing it consistently,btohqsg
and on&off here and the other chat but imo mainly here more than the other chat,btohqsg
Meh can‚Äôt rly care about this if no one wants to help then they‚Äôll just not reply,btohqsg
This chat is like very random anyway,btohqsg
A lot of my messages get drowned out,btohqsg
I mean I think she briefly mentioned about it,btohqsg
There‚Äôs just too many when there‚Äôs many chatting at once,btohqsg
And I think someone here that knows her said some stuff about it,btohqsg
Like she got seek help before,btohqsg
Also idk why sometimes in the other chat ppl keep asking very general qns,btohqsg
Like how to study for XXX subject,btohqsg
These sort of things can easily search online and there would be better answers,btohqsg
Lol I mean maybe they wanna hear personal exps,btohqsg
I'd assume boldly that they are already calm enough to be discussing this subject,btohqsg
probably they want personal experiences ba,btohqsg
also just offtopic but have you guys seen the key_battle_5633 guy on reddit,btohqsg
he has like a big inferiority complex,btohqsg
"so like he writes alot of comments about how he didnt do well for psle and o levels so he sees himself as inferior and he also likes to call his own jc a ""low mid tier jc""",btohqsg
wait let me send an exchange i had w him,btohqsg
actually in TM  the H1 chinese is always late in the afternoon and i had 2h gap between my last lesson and H1 chinese,btohqsg
i think he is from TM right iirc,btohqsg
i saw something he wrote on a TM post,btohqsg
the time when bruh i remembered writing the same thing over and over again becoz there were at least 5 posts asking the same thing,btohqsg
then what is with this inferiority,btohqsg
dk what you mean by irl but it‚Äôs math that a lot of engineering or science majors would learn in y1  of uni. not all of it bc it depends on the major itself but stuff like linear algebra and multivariable calculus,btohqsg
bro who tf is this key battle,btohqsg
i see him in every comment,btohqsg
do i still look back and said i did shit in psle and hate myself for it,btohqsg
idk why he called asrjc mid-low jc,btohqsg
personally i dont feel comfortable with the jc tiers,btohqsg
Ya it's not even that low,btohqsg
probably coz of the merger and serangoon dragged it down,btohqsg
it used to be sub 10 cut off a few years back,btohqsg
end of the day it‚Äôs the students that go in not the sch itself,btohqsg
NAH the last comment is so üíÄüò≠ü§°,btohqsg
@polarbearnextdooryou have to see the last comment,btohqsg
what i would not even waste my time talking to someone like him,btohqsg
this guy like got borderline personality disorder lol,btohqsg
he is making an over-generalized statement  not all elites are like that,btohqsg
good boy has got me üò≠ü§£,btohqsg
tbh i keep saying i hate the elites too coz some of them are really looking down on those who arent doing that well BUT doesnt look like IP is gonna stay there so is he blaming the government,btohqsg
i remembered in sec sch i said i hated the government for creating ip coz it gives them an adv of not needing to take an extra national exam,btohqsg
i mean like it comes at a cost what if the person cannot do well for A level then gg alr,btohqsg
At least the o level person still has better qualifications,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt think you can justify how he‚Äôs processing things with your own thought process,btohqsg
i went on linkedin stalking spree and i realised a lot of my course mates have 90rps  im feeling inferior now,btohqsg
ok true he is not thinking like a normal person,btohqsg
why nyjc festival then become this,btohqsg
then thats a personal skill issue already,btohqsg
i think key_battle_5633 said he wanted to go ny but after seeing how hype it is he doesnt wanna go anymore ? smth like that,btohqsg
one of my bro friend got pushed back to O levels in sec 3 i think,btohqsg
but the school will not let someone go all the way to y4 if they are not performing well,btohqsg
yea if ur really üíÄüíÄ they wont let you promote to jc,btohqsg
if you promoted means you still got chance,btohqsg
i feel sorry for him cause he clearly has some self esteem issues that he needs to work on as a result of constantly comparing himself to other pplthen again i feel like i'd not want to be friends with people who act like this because it's kinda exhausting having to constantly validate them (and if you dont theres a high chance they'll feel like you are looking down on them),btohqsg
ok tbh no hate but vj  ri  hci are the more elite elite one  so he is not wrong in that aspect,btohqsg
wouldn‚Äôt really put vj next to those,btohqsg
like i only interacted with him once but even then i was quite uncomfortable with how he kept calling himself stupid,btohqsg
actually tbh i have some sort of self-esteem issues too but just that i dun openly go say and discuss about it,btohqsg
same   i usually only talk to my close friends about it,btohqsg
actually in jc  my cher had higher confidence than me then me with myself,btohqsg
also im kinda relieved this guy isnt in the discord cause if he said he got 248 and did badly for psle  he'd be bullied which would make him feel worse because his self image is already bad,btohqsg
the cher know the A lvl syllabus more than you so they shld know your potential,btohqsg
yep he got 248 (he says it alot),btohqsg
bruh i got 213 and i just like totally moved on,btohqsg
my econs cher can say she expect an A for me despite i think my prelim was botherline B,btohqsg
i think for a lot of people who got 240-249  is either1. they are really happy cause they expected 230 range2. they are really really sad cause they cannot make it to ip and these are prob the ppl who dream of going to ip for a long time,btohqsg
my mum is more disappointed in my bro's 248 than him,btohqsg
i know both of these kinds of ppl,btohqsg
coz she knows he has potential to get 2 better,btohqsg
my mom was disappointed the day i got my results and say i should have worked harder but ended up bragging about my results to every aunty she meets,btohqsg
i dont have it cause i was scrolling through his profile,btohqsg
my dad was happy and bragging my JC results but my mum is kinda no emotions,btohqsg
my cousin told her mum that everyone asking her why her cousin is everywhere on top but where is she,btohqsg
not wrong  schools are very stingy when it comes to giving marks,btohqsg
my parents did not expect me to make it to jc,btohqsg
and then scared i will fail A levels with my O levels result,btohqsg
despite knowing the subject that contributed the most to my O level score i wun be taking it lol,btohqsg
i was hoping to go jc coz i dw go poly lol,btohqsg
Lol what in the overachiever sia,btohqsg
i have a friend who calls asrjc jc sajc a low tier jc...,btohqsg
hes not even happy with being in a pretty good jc. hes insistent that ri is the only good school in sg,btohqsg
what jc that person is in,btohqsg
everyday rants to me about how he hates going to school just because he isnt in a raffles uniform,btohqsg
he also likes to boast to me about how like his sec sch friends all went ri and scored like 9A1s or some shit,btohqsg
Dude damn free sia just use that energy to study la the fuck,btohqsg
he studies literally until the middle of the night everyday,btohqsg
man vj uniform is so much better than rj uniform,btohqsg
he‚Äôs boasting about other people getting into the sch he ddint?,btohqsg
ik this bc i got his ypt,btohqsg
i mean maybe his end goal is to make me look bad lah,btohqsg
because im also in a single digit pointer jc but just not as good as his,btohqsg
dun waste ur time on such people,btohqsg
that‚Äôd be my cue to cut off,btohqsg
once on sge reddit some guy kept complaining abt being in TMJC and got alot of downvotes when he called his JC orientation boring,btohqsg
i also hv a friend who RI 90RP H3 chem distinction but tells me he is stupid  no capacity to retain info  he thinks im better than him and blah blah,btohqsg
my friend would be roasting himself on rsge if downvotes didnt exist lol,btohqsg
i honestly found TMJC ori fun leh,btohqsg
i think he's just damn salty he cannot get into asrjc,btohqsg
like his school did rather well for 2023 a's and hes saying like vjc is an embarassment,btohqsg
"then he also call tmjc ""a lousy school""",btohqsg
that was me for a period of time,btohqsg
coz i missed it by the last slot ballot only,btohqsg
might as well ask him to drop out,btohqsg
my l1r5 also cannot get me into asrjc üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
quoting my sis's el tuition teacher  u become a big fish in a small pond  so not that bad,btohqsg
in my class i feel like small fish in a big pond,btohqsg
u want small fish in a big pond or big fish in a small pond,btohqsg
it is not the end of the world,btohqsg
my view is  just block him,btohqsg
aya just ask him focus to top VJ,btohqsg
Tbh regardless of whr U end up,btohqsg
if there is a will there is a way,btohqsg
Complain so much also no use,btohqsg
Apparently Ur batch got some clowns stealing j2 notes üíÄ,btohqsg
Forgot I got tell U that one,btohqsg
why would there be j2 notes left in the lt,btohqsg
i just want to have my own pond,btohqsg
""" place of opportunity ""- broccoli head",btohqsg
like they couldn't have chosen a better shade of blue,btohqsg
ok at least MI uniform = cjc uniform,btohqsg
i remembered in jc there was a few times where i did not make it in time down and the lecturer left and so i took the attendance file home a few times,btohqsg
imo cjc uniform is better by a small margin bc i prefer the shade of blue for theirs,btohqsg
MI just dk how to enforce rules,btohqsg
eh it is that student fault for leaving the notes in the LT  i cant imagine why would there be notes left lying in the lt,btohqsg
dude he literally says that the chances of him scoring 70rp is slim to none because hes not in ri,btohqsg
tell him it‚Äôs his skill issue,btohqsg
it is the students not the teachers,btohqsg
i literally thought of the fmath girl bc once she literally barged into a h2 chem class and looked at the noges,btohqsg
with poor teachers  if u are resourceful enough  u can find resources and do weel,btohqsg
