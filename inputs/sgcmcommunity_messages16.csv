you  will never know how fast others can be faster tha you,btohqsg
A lot of drivers do give way and they do it in Advance when they see u approaching at high speed in sg it’s that few that really spoils your day,btohqsg
My dad said to me when I first passed my driving. Any idiot can floor the accelerator and it is no indication of skill. Rather it is about vehicle control and interaction with fellow road users.,btohqsg
Yes agreed! And those drivers I do wave to thank them when passing,btohqsg
yes when on lane 1 even though no cars behind i always check rear view mirror every 5 secs  if see faster car coming  just signal left and give way. don't know why so many find it so hard to do that,btohqsg
Because speed limit 90 means 90 is ok,btohqsg
haha 90 i close one eye give them. they are going 70+ on lane 1 😂,btohqsg
Japanese driver aso very courteous ..but their speed limit like ours 80 to 100 on highway. want fast aso can't fast😂😂,btohqsg

alfa - more respected than bmw. but they screwed up early in the 70s-80s,btohqsg
I sell my Lao 159 to you lor ai mai😂,btohqsg
considering enzo ferrari was apprentice in Alfa and learned the ropes there,btohqsg
https://www.wheels.ca/reviews/buying-used-2017-2020-alfa-romeo-giuliaTo understand where Alfa Romeo is coming from requires a little history. In 1967  the company sought funds from the Italian government to build its affordable front-wheel-drive Alfasud  but politics intervened  and the money came with strings: the new factory had to situated in the poor south of Italy.While well-intentioned  the government edict saddled Alfa with workers who were seemingly unqualified. Frequent strikes in the 1970s ground production to a halt. Workers refused to apply primer to car bodies because of health concerns. That  combined with cheaper steel sourced from Russia  sealed the cars’ repute for rusting away.Add to that the litany of broken welds  bad fuel pumps  faulty electrics and overheated  leaky engines and Alfa Romeo’s reputation was cast. When Fiat Chrysler (now Stellantis) brought Alfa back to North America in 2017  Alfisti prayed that things had changed.,btohqsg
I am gonna drive hitch and save money and buy these rimshttp://www.heritagewheel.com/sakura,btohqsg
original leather seat. still tight tight no crease,btohqsg
i have no interest in front wheel alfa,btohqsg
ig giulias can be had for less than 100k it is a great buy. switch,btohqsg
giulia veloce 5 years for less than 100k. wow,btohqsg
the many internal politics within alfa ruined them for so many years from making proper sports cars that rival bmw mercees. until the giulia.,btohqsg
after alfa 75 which is a real enthusiast's car  alfa did a half hearted job of king frotn wheel cars to save money.,btohqsg
see in america  all over they love tesla,btohqsg
Giulia gearbox should be more stable than its predecessor,btohqsg
true. that is the only serious front drive cars that has won races,btohqsg
zf automatics like bmw has chosen. 8 speed really solid ones,btohqsg
Giulia is the proper machine that brings back alfa.,btohqsg
no need scared turn everywhere keep see your same car model,btohqsg
you driving one? cool car too,btohqsg
a brand new one is like 145000k cloverleaf in 2019,btohqsg
alfa i wld buy is probs 4C and Giulia,btohqsg
you dont buy alfa for resale. because if you speak tthis way then you are not enthusiast,btohqsg
andc for me i would only consider Giulia. i tested it in 2018 for a friend and he's instantly hooked,btohqsg
wah eh cannot say like that la bro haha,btohqsg
thats y it's great news for enthusiasts. u get to buy cheap,btohqsg
exactly. get it cheap. because it is not for many,btohqsg
so hopefully nobody wants. in fact if below 100k used 5 years a veloce can be had. it is good deal,btohqsg
let the mainstream stick with the germans,btohqsg
i dont seek popular opinions when i buy car. i buy what i like.,btohqsg
like my GFS said women who duno cars see AR aso know it's a branded beautiful car,btohqsg
sell t his to get giulia,btohqsg
Giulia quality is very good. read the long term tests by users in US europe all say good. on par with germans.,btohqsg
I got feeling with my oldie... 😘,btohqsg
it's not a fast car. but I just love it😂,btohqsg
the front drive alfas  while okay  are just too front heavy. they are mostly highway tourers like GT. but they dont perform well on track,btohqsg
AR SUV is a big turn off btw😂,btohqsg
There a member name soon here   his car is over 30 years old,btohqsg
I can’t maintain a car over 6 years old,btohqsg
wow wat car ? Merc Toyota?,btohqsg
Last time is Mini Cooper s then 528,btohqsg
Then no s is change car every 3 years around there,btohqsg
Repair untill vomit blood   today lead engine oil   tomorrow radiator explode   then. Fuel pump did,btohqsg
sometimes is Heng suay... I know of ppl who drive 3 series till 10 year clock near 300kkm on original transmission n engine,btohqsg
Maybe I floor all my car too much,btohqsg
I always v tec kick in yoz,btohqsg
u want song .u got to pay lor,btohqsg
Fuel consumption is too good and tune low end torque,btohqsg
light weight... the way a sport car should be actually . not like nowadays sports cars,btohqsg
Ya when I do corner with fit at 70 km I feel like woo hoo car is like gonna flip,btohqsg
the way is to change ALL,btohqsg
and keep a journal of what,btohqsg
then you are good. 100% can maintain,btohqsg
Now ev is god sent to me,btohqsg
alot ws going to close in the next 10 years😂,btohqsg

https://youtu.be/IdH6ST9hbbsI think He said it's half 458 Italia engine 😂He can't hardly fit in the car 😂,btohqsg
Because it’s a low sales brand. Did you forget what happened to the unpopular cars in the past? Fiat opel skoda,btohqsg
Runs on VW MQB platform right  parts no issue,btohqsg
well this is a VAG car..,btohqsg
Surely got more parts availability than alfa,btohqsg
u can literally throw porsche parts from the macan 2.0 into the cupra😂😂,btohqsg
VAG MQB platform all have similar parts,btohqsg
Literally call a stockist and you get parts same day,btohqsg
I find that the giulia fromt doors are abit too small  i have difficulties getting in and out,btohqsg
Mr Xun  you’re tall. Eh but aren’t Italians too?!,btohqsg
I wouldn’t have a problem for sure. I just fit in the baby seat.,btohqsg
i am unfortuantely average in height mr anwo😵‍💫😵‍💫,btohqsg
From a golf R upto the macan,btohqsg
VAG cars have a lot of part sharing which can be for the better or worse,btohqsg
so did he buy the Giulia or the 4c😂. Jeremery Clarkson has been a well known Alfa head since day 1,btohqsg
but the front so squeezy ? Italians all shortys?🤣🤣,btohqsg
haha is not really squeezy  but the B pillar is in the way,btohqsg
I love the 8c… but none here,btohqsg
can always get the younger brother  4c,btohqsg
Alfa is truly quirky tho  the 4C has 1 extra vent on the left compared to the right,btohqsg
exp. wonder how much Jeremy Clarkson bought in Uk,btohqsg
I believe it was between 70 to 80k GBP,btohqsg
If you had this youre in for huge profits.,btohqsg
Some might say you're a winner,btohqsg
Look at those 60 plus k depreciation,btohqsg
will you sell your tesla buy 458?,btohqsg
If I want sleep sofa every day,btohqsg
A wise man once said  you can sleep in a car but you can't drive a house,btohqsg
If haven’t married and want impress gal maybe,btohqsg
But then pplCompare whose house bigger,btohqsg
FF/GTC4Lusso quite comfy to sleep in also  just fold the rear seats flat,btohqsg
That why buy a car that the depreciation is less then your monthly income,btohqsg
You're right  need to have some money for 7-11 food and parking,btohqsg
30% go property and 20% spending   rest is saving and investment,btohqsg
ya like my boss . I think his pay plus bonus n incentives at least 25k per month...,btohqsg
20 k a month can buy a 19 k depreciation car,btohqsg
20 k a year is last time buy landed 1 not sure can’t afford,btohqsg
I also want to earn 20k a month,btohqsg
his wife Arn 15k per month,btohqsg
I thought u are 500 k a year,btohqsg
Now decent landed in better location around 5 m,btohqsg
They combine 35 k before tax   monthly installment is around 18 k,btohqsg
still ok la use 1 pax pay for installment,btohqsg
Depent on Thier purchase price   like is said if those 5 m type sure not enoigh,btohqsg
That why he drive Honda Fit,btohqsg
I work with him 15 yrs,btohqsg
SomePpl save a lot in all area for housing,btohqsg
My staff also like such most of the income to property,btohqsg
But he is those smarter type   he buy is to rent,btohqsg
he still got a condo rented out,btohqsg
He is in late 40s? Or early 50,btohqsg
most important both husband n wife got good income,btohqsg
20 k is decent income nowadays not really good la especially for late 40/,btohqsg
Good income is at least 360 k a year,btohqsg
Top income is at least 500 k onwards   rich is above 1 m,btohqsg
U just look at the income tax bracket u know,btohqsg
200 k is like the 4th bracket   and is upper middle,btohqsg
but smart la... put all money in property n not in cars. sure huatt one property in sg,btohqsg
U do some maths he don’t left much also,btohqsg
now want own multiple property not easy liao with absd,btohqsg
Rich ppl buy small building like service residence with no absd,btohqsg
Around 10 m and above for smallPlace,btohqsg
If u got property agent friend can ask them those rich ppl income kinda crazy 1 haha,btohqsg
Even property and insurance agent got so many million dollar table ppl last year,btohqsg
just now i saw a sinkie tesla 3 with dual tone colors - green and black. whose?,btohqsg
There are so many of it,btohqsg
Saw a ioniq 5 today. Looks handsome,btohqsg
Would prefer an ioniq over tesla  unironically,btohqsg
Just find the exterior unique and rare in sg too,btohqsg
Not the usual ioniq. Ioniq 5,btohqsg
Looks very retro-futuristic  absolutely love the lights. Pulls like a MF 🤣,btohqsg
There's a few options  all of them look great!,btohqsg
Also very spacious on the inside,btohqsg
Not on sale yet I believe,btohqsg
Only a few units were brought in as part of a pilot project between SP group and Hyundai,btohqsg
The prices for the cars brought in for that lot were 140k for the rwd and 170k for awd,btohqsg
With COE. 50 units were brought in,btohqsg
But this was sold as more of a subscription model for the project,btohqsg
the style is so original. much better looking than many Japanese ones,btohqsg
Ioniq5 available for refundable booking now for 500  delivery early next yr made in sg factory. Available for test drive at kmc,btohqsg
But coe should still be bad. But no harm put 500 for a queue if current car is due to change and wanted to venture to ev. No other details now for pricing  this it’s fully refundable,btohqsg
Refundable booking? Then everyone would dash to book,btohqsg
I’m still perplexed why they wanna set up factory in singapore,btohqsg
Good eh near my house everyday can go there kaypoh,btohqsg
Smart. How many hours a day does one spend driving vs how many hours one enjoys the house with his loved ones? I’d rather nice house anytime over nice car.,btohqsg
Exactly. Not much left perhaps but what is important is there is value retention in what he invests in (plus capital gain and rental potential) vs definite depreciation year on year for cars.,btohqsg
That’s what my se told me. Anyway I just put first Loh. 🤭,btohqsg
This would also be a smart buy. Drive for “free” with the value going up,btohqsg
No   and I am sad they don’t want let me see Thier nice car interior,btohqsg
Then  how come they can be on the road roaming around? They give Kopi money to TP or LTA officers?,btohqsg
Wah sensitive la   I think is lack of enforcement,btohqsg
When they get stopped for a check the tints are measured but many are not illegal as well,btohqsg
There's a limit to how much one can tint  and many of them still follow as they don't want the fine,btohqsg
He meant those very dark 1 sure fail 1,btohqsg
Yah Hahahaa. Lots of cars install dark tints too … Swee lah… just remove before inspection  and run the risk of failing random LTA checks lor,btohqsg
Just.. don’t cry and complain and blame government for getting an inspection notice when rules are clear?,btohqsg
I wonder how come they allow to import and install onto the windows of these cars by workshop in the first place?,btohqsg
My friend got one when he went back to his car after lunch 😅,btohqsg
Because the limits for front and back tints different and the film is the same  so just put the back one up front,btohqsg
dark dark is good for nite outings into quiet corners at night.,btohqsg
So boring be like me use clear tint,btohqsg
You say one ah  later everyone here come stand outside your car to see see 🙈,btohqsg
I’ve seen nice continental all dark! Can’t see the driver and passengers. Like those drug cartel boss or hitman.,btohqsg
Reallly I just did mine 4 month ago   and I choose the most clear 1,btohqsg
look more premium . the window will reflect like glasses,btohqsg
No wor I think my tint more atas,btohqsg
Can hanky panky in the car under broad day light! Hahaha,btohqsg
I need go and take a sexy photo of my clear tint,btohqsg
Now no need tints loh… many cars put full window sunshades also end up same effect 😉😉,btohqsg
Can see the blue tint is so sexy,btohqsg
Maybe these cars are driven by vampires  scared of sunlight.,btohqsg
The green and blue tone screen are cool. I like that in continental cars. Not seen them on Japanese make.,btohqsg
Yes I also prefer it over dark tint,btohqsg
And police sure won’t catch me,btohqsg
Agree. Some Tints really add a premium feel,btohqsg
sunshade really got cooling effect ..but night time better don't use. unless u want Hanky panky,btohqsg
so much fire these days. ebike?,btohqsg
Currently authorities no concerns with fires in carparks cause the stats are insignificant to warrant investment on battery hazards prevention. Maybe when a few lives lost then maybe deep dive. Just like private condo swimming pools  drownings are not a major concerns. 🤣,btohqsg
Got insurance no scare. Just like healthcare. Just up insurance premiums will help 😂,btohqsg
wonder how much compensation for property fire cases...cost alot man do redo the house,btohqsg
Housing insurance the cheapest premium ever. Ask those insurance agents they rather sell you term insurance 🤣,btohqsg
cos it's not everyday houses got burnt down. but this month quite jialat.. weather too hot😅,btohqsg
Building burnt down then more jialat.,btohqsg
that one insurance pay till no tears😂,btohqsg
So much so the relevant authorities have to step in,btohqsg
I think the aftermath for those staying around the burnt unit suffer the most,btohqsg
Like lemon car  just your luck in life,btohqsg
Carpark unless they listen to pi and use 3 pin plug,btohqsg
Wall charger and such need lew and letter of no objection from ems,btohqsg
With yearly inspection is very safe. 1,btohqsg
3-pins plugs? In landed already using that liao,btohqsg
Who use that please tell me as no ppl want house to get burn,btohqsg
Yes.. as long for lew  yearly inspections sure cover backsides,btohqsg
Ok. My bad. All terminated to same power box,btohqsg
These are install by certified electrician and approve by lew,btohqsg
Ya lah. Just like any PEs,btohqsg
Got major issues  send to jail niah,btohqsg
Ebike all these always on fire because they don’t have bms system in car and the charging port is not dedicated,btohqsg
Lol. Hard to say  as long the parts are manufactured overseas. Just a batch problem. Doesn’t mean there is no lemon cars,btohqsg
All wait to see when it happens,btohqsg
U go to ad they won’t give u 3 pin plug   only pi will and this is concerning,btohqsg
So don’t buy from PI. Recalls also no recourse eh,btohqsg
But i have to say  not all PI are bad.,btohqsg
Even ad don’t know what to do hahaah,btohqsg
Exactly… they will refer to the parent company.,btohqsg
So much so on trained expertise sometimes…,btohqsg
The software they won’t release to ad also la,btohqsg
Just like those modding cars  there is not such things as warranty but how much one willing to lose niah,btohqsg
Now like my car recall is just go to car and update haha,btohqsg
Just like your phone u think Apple will release the software to dealer,btohqsg
Ev is a giant phone with wheels,btohqsg
I think my car kana recall twice liao,btohqsg
Hardware replacement some times for the recalls,btohqsg
As long got ramifications  still not bad and dealers are willing to do it.,btohqsg
Conti cars plenty of recalls that does nothing. Like some engines love to eats oil. 🤣,btohqsg
Every 5k mileage need to top up engine oil.,btohqsg
And that’s a norm to some,btohqsg
Hardware recalls are the ones which you can’t do on the fly. Is it true even the distributor don’t keep good stock of replacement parts for immediate replacements?,btohqsg
Now worsened by the excuses of worldwide shortage and crisis,btohqsg
Possible leaks aside  also depends on how one runs the engine too especially when it’s sudden higher than norm consumption?,btohqsg
If cars need more than 6-months to deliver  you think spare parts will be kept preemptively?,btohqsg
True. The pistons not sealed properly but no one will want to deal with operating the engine so early,btohqsg
Some enthusiasts will buy parts early before their cars arrived. These are the one prepared to mod cars 😅,btohqsg
That is something I’ve been curious about. I have my thoughts but would love to hear honest feedback when things need replacement such as suspension  steering components  lamp clusters  battery  fluids  or even panel replacements from accidents etc.,btohqsg
I’ve seen a lot of Tesla accident vehicles in workshops so I wonder sometimes.,btohqsg
How many airbags in a Tesla,btohqsg
Regular scheduled changes under preventive maintenance is not accidents hor 😂,btohqsg
My recall is rear motor will have problemWhen using track mode and 1 I forget lioa hahab,btohqsg
Like heck.. most Tesla owners dont get commission from promoting the brand but no one seems to be willing to share any honest feedback other than the usual rhetoric,btohqsg
sg Tesla is made in America or china,btohqsg
Model 3 is China   model y is Germany,btohqsg
I see. Dual motor is china or us?,btohqsg
Now sg only got model 3,btohqsg
Many car parts from china anyway. I love audi and vw,btohqsg
so many Tesla these days... last year I will turn head n see. not these days,btohqsg
Lol… i rather look out for chery qq or proton,btohqsg
Except the lowered ones with gorgeous rims and Vorsteiner body kit,btohqsg
Even that honda e is a rare gem,btohqsg
Rare doesn’t need to be pretty.,btohqsg
Enuf for people to turn heads if that’s what one wants,btohqsg
I like the Honda E actually leh hahah,btohqsg
but depends what u want use it for lor,btohqsg
Such a cool stylish ride. Quite a statement,btohqsg
Look and drool is free mah heheh,btohqsg
I wish some old iconic cars can make a comeback,btohqsg
Like those cars with flip lamps,btohqsg
my wife will think I m crazy if I buy this car lol,btohqsg
Such things cannot go through wife lah,btohqsg
Not if it’s a present for her!,btohqsg
galue quite nice if u can't afford RR,btohqsg
Buy tesla with fsd   self driving,btohqsg
I only saw once in sg,btohqsg
Cannot be too rare. Else become like vintage cars,btohqsg
mitsuoka are modded Jap cars to look like cars from our grandpas era,btohqsg

High speed racing is just dumb and dangerous,btohqsg
if only today's engines can do this kind of sound.,btohqsg
I drove near few Aston Martin ... all quiet like normal car... EV?,btohqsg
Their engines have an elegant gentle rumble,btohqsg
Not open valves Look At Me types,btohqsg
I was tailgating behnd this AM. keep thinking y so quiet one,btohqsg
Even though their engines are huge V8s and above,btohqsg
I drove next to a DBX once. Sporty sounds and one blink of my eye  he was gone.,btohqsg
Quite nice to see something this size move in such a way.,btohqsg
If they want to push will be a bit louder  but very soothing sound,btohqsg
good to be low profile n quiet... not like some cheap Coe lancer noisy like fxxx😂,btohqsg
EVs would be perfect to maintain low profile and be quiet  but sadly most EV drivers prefer flooring the car off traffic lights,btohqsg
in 10 years time . maybe all will be adopting EV. nothing to prove. even your EV grabcar will be just as fast as you,btohqsg
Or everything could be synthetic fuel 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
Cause as of now EV also pseudo green,btohqsg
i think tesla will likely invest in indonesia. this is good. instead of doing malaysia.,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/fWEXlp7cWYYaiyoh why so much hate. Peace leh ✌🏼,btohqsg
maybe they lose too much in recent Tesla shares bloodbath😂,btohqsg
To the moon and beyond !,btohqsg
"buy buy buyt. will be a ""collector""",btohqsg
Ya I want win a free modelS,btohqsg
A lot of owners have caught people keying their cars using sentry mode,btohqsg
Regular nice cars also vandalized just that there's no camera for them to see at times,btohqsg
@bbfasingaporebe nice.don’t floor your car at trafficlights.you’ll get scratched a lot more often.,btohqsg
My car is only scratched once in the so many years of owning.,btohqsg
But usually unintentional ones and the person has apologized,btohqsg
my honda always scratched idk who does cos my car no cam,btohqsg
If you always floor this at traffic lights it can be regarded as a sign to show off. And hence can attract jealous to scratch your car.,btohqsg
I just don’t want to block ppl,btohqsg
And help traffic be more smooth,btohqsg
Can move off. Don’t floor it,btohqsg
Damn that the fun part I still thinking to do hitch and floor it,btohqsg
later if you t-bone someone not blocking people?,btohqsg
since there's people coming in from side lanes at times and filter lanes,btohqsg
Wont la u don’t floor for long period of time,btohqsg
1 second enough  speaking from experience with teslas flooring it unexpectedly and almost going into the side or back of my vehicle while I was turning in from a side lane or changing lanes,btohqsg
electricity is cheap oil is not... floor won't feel heart pain😂,btohqsg
I agree. You wanna play this. Do it on track. Don’t do on busy streets,btohqsg
What if you make a mistake? You caused misery to people,btohqsg
Only floor when the road is clear ma and I within speed limit,btohqsg
I see here and there not dangerous la,btohqsg
Don’t do on streets. Be responsible la,btohqsg
I ask ppl if I am dangerous anot next time hehe,btohqsg
Will Tottenham get relegated next season,btohqsg

Don't scold other people n you're safe no matter who you support 👍,btohqsg
Why is there a coe eV 😝,btohqsg
I can't imagine a 15year old tesla with 7-8k Road tax,btohqsg

Do y'all wish to continue seeing more good deals like this?👀,btohqsg
Good deals on shitbox JDM please,btohqsg
those are never good  deals cmon wake up,btohqsg
some people like to restore let them la,btohqsg
some cars possess things modern cars don’t have,btohqsg
good for them  but no way i'm calling them good deals  though,btohqsg
record for being on the jacks,btohqsg
$1000 for auto supra u won’t take 🌚?,btohqsg
$1000 for 1 week rental ah no thanks,btohqsg
how do you like a rod flying out of your bonnet?,btohqsg
rather pay  2k for a z4,btohqsg
i like oil and water together,btohqsg
good taste but 2K abit overpriced,btohqsg
this one not like in good condition only 😂,btohqsg
idk he said 1k for a auto supra,btohqsg
with sgcarmart  you can get it for a lower price😉😉,btohqsg
@SGCM_Admincan help me lower the price of gtr? 288k is too expensive,btohqsg
i heard headgasket is one the favourites in your search history,btohqsg
Why always have promos? Sales not good?,btohqsg
why alfa no promos? sales too good?,btohqsg
promo or not they still earn,btohqsg
enthusiast car  they're not in it for the volumes anyway,btohqsg
you not their salesman ma  you mazda salesman i sure buy,btohqsg
their target audience not as big as mazda,btohqsg
I guess you have to direct this question to the ADs themselves😂,btohqsg
margin high and volumes decent  can sell and still cover up,btohqsg
why promo  though? eurokars pays sgcm to advertise  therefore got promo,btohqsg
2.5 liter cx5 would be better. Car body is heavy,btohqsg
"Also  Most ADs always have ""promo"" rather discount in the form of an over trade on the value of your trade in car. Just that some dealers with good volumes and demand tend to drop the price a bit more by absorbing increase in COE/further trade in bonus/free road tax for a year/accessories  etc.",btohqsg
So many brands in singapore for a small market,btohqsg
Some will have to shut down,btohqsg
market not that small to be honest,btohqsg
market size is capped for sure (COE Quota)  but the competition is high and demand exists,btohqsg
Yupp  they tend to move over to a partner dealer and do PI arrangements at times,btohqsg
In case their own appointed AD decides to shut down. But usually every AD will have more than 1 brand that they are serving as the dealer for or have a good pre owned subsidiary,btohqsg
For example  C&C has Mitsubishi  Mercedes  Kia  Citroen  DS  Maxus etc and their used car dealer. Obviously citroen  DS  etc. sales much lower. But their margins and volumes are higher on the kia and merc side of things,btohqsg
I remember many years ago a dealer backed up by strong ntuc dropped opel,btohqsg
further  they get commercial clients a lot of times as well. If you remember opel  not very popular  but they gave out good deals to PHV leasing companies and put a lot of their Mokkas on the road,btohqsg
Another company picked them up  and they are doing pretty decent with the PHV leasing with Crosslands and Mokkas and the commercial side of the business,btohqsg
Cupra. I wonder how long they can last,btohqsg
Actually a lot of people know of it,btohqsg
It was a part of SEAT back in the day  acted as their AMG/RS/M  then it became its own brand using the SEAT cars and selling as a performance variant. They are sold out of the SEAT dealership itself,btohqsg
actually Cupra Leon is quite good  gives an alternative to the Golf GTI.Might love the Cupra Leon abit more🤭🤭,btohqsg
Precisely  they are similarly priced as well and the Cupra Leon actually offers 55bhp more than the GTI and they use the same powertrain essentially.,btohqsg
Since the Tiguan R isnt arriving in SG  glad we still have the Cupra Ateca,btohqsg
We also have the Leon Sportstourer and the Formentor,btohqsg
there's no direct comparison on offer as such apart from the octavia rs which is a sedan,btohqsg
If the mazda 6 wagon 2.5NA selling less than 200k then it is a good deal,btohqsg
isnt it selling much lesser than that?,btohqsg
Tempted on that but the road tax,btohqsg
pretty good I guess for what you get at that price,btohqsg
Haha still okay la  2.5 and 2 is not tht big of a difference. I think CX5/M6 and above need the 2.5  2.0 really abit weak,btohqsg
Additionally its NA  cant tune or anything,btohqsg
M6 need tune if not slow,btohqsg
but for tuning  anything with forced induction is preferred,btohqsg
how do you like getting gapped by 1.0 turbos,btohqsg
M6 warranty over put in a turbo,btohqsg
I saw a M6 Kenna smoke by i30 1.0T,btohqsg
M6 not too fast  meant for gentle cruise only,btohqsg
Can tell M6 tried it best,btohqsg
you say one ah  later some people come scold you 😂😂😂,btohqsg
dont smoke pls  ik u faster😉😉,btohqsg
I met m6 tail gate and over take me on the right lane and give me the why your car so slow look,btohqsg
See if I can find the video he drive like Tokyo drift   car is slow   driver is fast,btohqsg
Even my neighbor got Mazda 6 also say so slow so tune,btohqsg
It about mentality to some driver met a few sticker and just floor all the way over a period of time sure can,btohqsg
dont buy new mazda. used one just as good at significantly lower price,btohqsg
so big so heavy. wan fight must also have the body...,btohqsg
Buy demo  bargain for a lower price,btohqsg
U still get 10 yr coe,btohqsg
go mlysia can smoke by myvi😂😂,btohqsg
Only in my u get tailgate by a myvi for been slow,btohqsg
But to me slow just give way lol   even if it myvi behind,btohqsg
around 2019  there's such offer when many mazda 6 were used to ferry delegates,btohqsg
but to me  a cut of 100k is worth it. 5 year old mazda is just as good,btohqsg
😲 A 24-year-old woman has been arrested for suspected drink driving after allegedly crashing a Mercedes-Benz into Fairmont Hotel.➡️https://bit.ly/3wvkbuZFollow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates,btohqsg
Mr Xun is a bit engrish strong one 💪🏼,btohqsg
anyone still stuck at malaysia custom towards woodlands?,btohqsg
Then merge to even smaller lane,btohqsg
rich kid no worries . daddy will buy her another benz,btohqsg
The insurance HV to pay hotel,btohqsg
For drink driving   even u stop at red light   and a car bang u from the rear also is drink driver fault,btohqsg
nowadays xmm very rich. the other day went vicom inspection. Infront one 911. come out car one xmm those poly or uni type age. stunned. I tot guy driver...,btohqsg
U think they XMM actually they older than u,btohqsg
Drink driving insurance can refuse claim,btohqsg
In fact any criminal case involved insurace can refuse,btohqsg
Nowadays alot of parents work very hard then the xmm xdd get the money and spent it all,btohqsg
they got great parents. I wan aso dun have,btohqsg
Not easy to spent it all,btohqsg
A lot of well to do parents are high income earner that is above 500 k a year   then Thier parents also pass on wealth to them   2 generations of wealth to current generations with property price sky high   earn rental yield can don’t work alreadg,btohqsg
maybe more than 2 generation. heard lky grandparents already rich ppl 😂,btohqsg
Use 2 is conservative la   I know a few don’t need to work monthly rental take in more then 50 k liao,btohqsg
Like someone I know like to go drink coffee at night drink beer with those ah pek and disturb beer lady,btohqsg
Wait for end mth rental come in bank,btohqsg
their life my dream... everyday wake up just think where to spend money. main priority,btohqsg
Don’t said shop house owner   u know those balastier and geylang small hotel   10 plus years ago some are below 2 m   like got 50 plus room,btohqsg
U just need to own 1 such hotel and don’t work le,btohqsg
now too exp liao to play  with multiple property in sg. savvy ones are heading Vietnam or Myanmar... more meat there,btohqsg
go poorer country to play the same game all over again,btohqsg
Is not even playing  high income bracket ppl like household income above 50 k a month will just buy property every few years   cause save too much also pointless,btohqsg
property price will be very divided between high end n mass market.,btohqsg
rich ppl dun buy ulu area,btohqsg
high end is those property above 5 m,btohqsg
and that 1 need to earn like 1 m a year not to strecth,btohqsg
peasant can only afford ulu condo.,btohqsg
ya key is not to overstrecth   seen so many ppl like 60% income into housing no point,btohqsg
then live like prison for the next 30 year,btohqsg
live in poverty for next 30 years... 😂.like Hongkie ppl. slave to mortgage their whole life.,btohqsg
Lee kah shing smart. leave first. hearsay he is going into Vietnam property now. to do what he is best at,btohqsg
Japanese pay their mortgage loan inherited from their parent in some of their mega cities.,btohqsg
it common actually  i got friend bought a small 2 bed room ec  then have to sell his honda fit  as cant  afford to maintain the car  monthly is moon shiny shiny,btohqsg
alot of ppl think buying property and staying inside is an investment  actually if you are staying inside is a liability  investment is rent out for cash flow,btohqsg
or u only use at most 40% of your income to pay for your mortages as a form of fighting inflation,btohqsg
Hong Kongers are fed up with raising property cost. Public housing take more than 7 years and above to get a small miserable unit.,btohqsg
overall fianicial decision is very important,btohqsg
tell me abt it... 50sqm heard is luxury thete😂😂,btohqsg
dont need said hk  u see singapore  some ppl buy car bank dont want to loan  they go in house loan that is like 3-5% intreast,btohqsg
That’s why yellow umbrella movement! Thanks to Covid-19 that put to a stop to the movement that polarised Hong Kong people,btohqsg
this is already worst decision ever,btohqsg
but gahmen dun wan us to buy multiple property rent out. that's y absd🥲,btohqsg
ya for the very rich . ...,btohqsg
u ask yourself  if u not a buisness man  no lobang in buisness  got spare saving of 1m   and u got invest in stocks already  what u do with the 1m? put fixed deposit?,btohqsg
very rich buy hotel  and such,btohqsg
most peasant how to bear come out 2 to 300k just to feed the gahmen absd,btohqsg
is not about that is about what u do with your saving,btohqsg
u can ask around   some ppl wont sell the property  even if it is above market rate  cause they will ask u back  u give me the money i put where,btohqsg
the question of u give me the money i put where is very real,btohqsg
Clowns still driving in tunnels without headlights turned off,btohqsg
Why can't they just set it to auto lights and drive faster... This guy in front of me was driving 70km/hr at KPE around Bartley Road area,btohqsg
Cause they are save driver and they paid road tax and a slow car so u have to wait behind him,btohqsg
These are the ppl that willl tell you Singapore no need fast car cause i just block them all,btohqsg
Or I got baby in car,btohqsg
company will close down  have to manage  might as well buy shares  but shares also can drop so much  that if u put all your saving inside u tihnk u are dumb also,btohqsg
After 20 years still can sell 488888 for the trueno,btohqsg
Keep ice car after 2040 no more ice all ev even myvi is a legend,btohqsg

Work horse   low price   ev   big space,btohqsg
Yupp  and currently running on a major backorder because the factory was shut down due to the Ukraine conflict stopping wire loom supply,btohqsg
dun really like Porsche design anyway. I just pick the more chio ones out of EV,btohqsg
Porsche is just so nice to drive also,btohqsg
8 to 9 months waiting minimum  and some options have been taken off the list as well because they will delay even further because chip shortage still around as well,btohqsg
Before Ukraine war my friend go buy Macan already needed 6 month lioa,btohqsg
6 months after chip shortage standard across most conti brands,btohqsg
plus point is got free parking at mbs . even if you drive a Coe one,btohqsg
Not always  the free parking is limited,btohqsg
6 hours and only for valet,btohqsg
But limited to 40 cars a day,btohqsg
My biggest regrets is never buy a 2nd hand panarama,btohqsg

Honestly very nicee  pays ode to the old 240z in terms of design language pretty well,btohqsg
400hp from factory is a plus too!,btohqsg
Me too Mr Arnav. Clean lines and a very refreshing change from the excessive bumper sculpting and addition of non-functional body vents which seems to be the norm these days.,btohqsg
Yes Mr Shane. The throwback design elements is just so elegantly executed.,btohqsg
Good for those who like a simple stock look or those who want to do extreme body kits,btohqsg
ok la . Mazda produced some sleek cars😂,btohqsg
When I am young and sexy   I love rx 8 a lot,btohqsg
Why want to zhng like mz3,btohqsg
