They tend to be more driven than sec sch ppp,btohqsg
I guess in jc minimum is 75 rp n above right,btohqsg
Whats the lowest u can get,btohqsg
High 60s also can get in,btohqsg
Very unlikely for any for local uni liao,btohqsg
my course in ntu is low demand but i got in with <70,btohqsg
the crazy competitive courses r med n law (no shiet) and CS prolly,btohqsg
But gonna face reality the hard way,btohqsg
business is like high demand high supply for uni spots,btohqsg
Tbh i feel u dont need business degree to start business,btohqsg
I kinda wish to start one but,btohqsg
Good to go for those business management kind,btohqsg
U got any idea in mind,btohqsg
Usually low effort ones is like handycraft,btohqsg
But like it's fucking time consuming,btohqsg
Also idw to end up hating it,btohqsg
Usually ppl stop doing coz it gets alot of their time eaten up,btohqsg
making patterns can be q stonks tho,btohqsg
And then if U Siam plushies n flowers U can kinda stand out in sg,btohqsg
I'm not kidding almost every seller ik prolly just do yhese,btohqsg
depending on the kind of business  you're better off going into a technical field,btohqsg
people need to learn what they get out of a business degree,btohqsg
primary skool didn't teach me that  big shaq did,btohqsg
Wait my bad didn't see more driven than sec sch,btohqsg
Ya thats what smth u can look into,btohqsg
But wouldn't they have some drive to even go jc,btohqsg

Wld yall reccomend learning python  java or c++ first..,btohqsg

Python for algo  automation and bots,btohqsg
Can also argue if u learn basic language first then anything else is easy,btohqsg
it’s just the most flexible and simple,btohqsg
pythonSch teaches you C and C++But you might as well learn others,btohqsg
in my engineering work previously  we use both C++ and python.Python was for the communication and information transfer between different devicesBut one of the machines run on C++ mainly  so it feeds the python program the info to transmit to other machines or softwares,btohqsg
Would say very goal-dependent if it's purely out of an interest of learning though. You don't really pick up very strong OOP skills with python (though you could argue that other paradigm have become more prominent).Java isn't very well recommended but it is still not a bad place to start  especially since it has very mature package/build systems and is rooted strongly in OOP,btohqsg
Python is certainly one of the easiest to get up and running with but I wouldn't say it's the best for learning imo (is essential if looking into data science/AI/ML fields),btohqsg
This is from a hobbyist/student perspective,btohqsg
it’s ofc goal dependent. python gives the easiest introduction while C++ teaches you more low level skills that might take you longer initially. can’t go wrong with either but i generally recommend python,btohqsg
can’t ever recommend java for a first one with how specialised it tends to be,btohqsg
My experience with java has been that it's pretty crucial in understanding the design choices of many other languages simply due to how influential it has been.Not the greatest or easiest language to start with  I can agree with that.,btohqsg
if u go nus I think you can't avoid it,btohqsg
I recommend python for first timer,btohqsg
that’s more of a statement about python being easy to learn,btohqsg
simple python programs looks very similar to pseudocode / natural language in structure  so the learning curve for newcomers is much less steep.,btohqsg
its okie i just enjoy mocking it 😋,btohqsg
yes thank you matcha for helping,btohqsg
It does get somewhat more painful when you are trying to push python further. Ingesting large amounts of data is not as convenient unless you use specific libraries with c bindings  etc.Different languages play different roles. C++ & Java is great if someone is interested in learning programming for the sake of learning programming.Python is a fun time for beginner Projects. JS as well if looking at web (Backend and Frontend) projects  though that's a completely different rabbit hole,btohqsg
you miss learning about type safety and certain concepts when starting with python since it's less opiniated of a language  imo,btohqsg
if they are learning as a beginner 95% of the time they will end up touching/transitioning into web development so python is completely valid for web as well,btohqsg
i mean my teacher also recommends python for first timers,btohqsg
are u still in land of freedom,btohqsg
fuck it LOL there wasn't anyth that good about it,btohqsg

but a lot of the ppl in the discord either1. dont use their brain2.dont have one,btohqsg
i think cause most ppl active here are oldef,btohqsg
then the ppl in the discord are most secsch or pre u age,btohqsg
damn so that kind of degen,btohqsg
could be entertaining as long as i don’t say anything,btohqsg
my discord name super diff from my tele anyway,btohqsg

I tried this ytd and it's so gd,btohqsg
i always go spicy and roasted sesame,btohqsg
Oh ya i forgot abt tht. Smtimes for some reason tinkercad code cannot work under arduino software,btohqsg
go telegram to talk about discord,btohqsg
but better yet dont learn any 😎😎,btohqsg
just create ur own programming language,btohqsg
Ooo jn I went spicy and honey mustard,btohqsg
Ahh I'll get that next timee,btohqsg
Does the roasted sesame overpower the spicy aroma,btohqsg
Eat once in a while only or like once every few months cause sian,btohqsg
Your very much welcome 🤗  anytime brother kuro,btohqsg
Is that the actual spelling for Zi char,btohqsg
Too much msg made me thirsty but it's also what made the rice tasty,btohqsg
Bro if u asked me boiled cauli or broccoli  I'd in a heartbeat choose cauli,btohqsg
It's like squidsquard eating krabby patty,btohqsg
Unless u drizzle smth to cover that raw veggie smell  I'd rather die than stuff it in my mouth,btohqsg
IKEA broccoli taste like pure nightmare,btohqsg
I thought it's same as frozen berries/fruis,btohqsg
The ikea ones made me gag after a few broccolis,btohqsg
I didn't know donki sell this,btohqsg
There's a 20% discount so it's 4.72 🤡 so  I  prob first & last time try,btohqsg
My verdict: It's nubbad if uw try but would I eat it again..no lol I mean it's tasty but I DIY even btr,btohqsg
i just got the kinex mala,btohqsg
my lunch + dinner in one,btohqsg
Coz i have one sichar near my hse,btohqsg
I eat once in a while,btohqsg
Captain kim or Seoul Garden better,btohqsg
Lmfao u reminded me of a COVID case,btohqsg
Bro that was me and my friends,btohqsg
But I also took veggies la,btohqsg
There comes a point when there is too much meat for me,btohqsg
Gimme one of ur go-to veggie fd place,btohqsg
Or I throw garlic at you,btohqsg
i usually go shabusai cause my moms friend works there,btohqsg
like someone said he wondered if i was gd in bed something along those lines,btohqsg
"Eh u remind me of my other friend A too  basically for sports inter class glass we dh enough ppl and my classmate was aboutta  call that guy(the kind which the cohort easily knows  famous/outgoing kinda vibe) and friend A was like "" nah hes not gonna join our team cause of me""Classmate: "" OH MY GOD why our class so much shit one""",btohqsg
Cause my class indeed have shit but nowhere as bad as other classes,btohqsg
bro I came across a utube shorts saying how the younger gens are screwed 🗿 and there was a whole study on it,btohqsg
"Caption was "" the younger generations are becoming dumber"" iirc",btohqsg
is the verification system on discord broken,btohqsg
ok time to log on back to my other acc,btohqsg
shabu sai the pork is better but suki-ya has good beef. shabu sai sauce options better i feel,btohqsg
Lucky I don't frequent discord often,btohqsg
gen alpha is 2010 onwards or,btohqsg
And if I ever do open discord  it's only to check on my game's market/economy,btohqsg
ppl keep confusing me with generations and the shit they share,btohqsg
not directed to anyone here but,btohqsg
Why discord so much things gg on one,btohqsg
I don't hear that from tele,btohqsg
Oh and those illegal Tele grp chats,btohqsg
some kid leaked us security secrets,btohqsg
I think he’s in jail now,btohqsg
i’ve been on enough discord servers tho,btohqsg
every year i log onto sgexams discord and lose brain cells,btohqsg
luckily it's a once a year thing,btohqsg
it makes me feel better about my brain cells,btohqsg
i’m using them for better things than talking abt wtv they talk abt,btohqsg
shabu sai is nicer to me but more pricey sukiya is a little more like a generic japanese restaurant that's q affordable me thinks,btohqsg
Shabu sai the portion so little bruh I every time ask for 10 sets the waiter look at me like so weird,btohqsg
feels like it depends on the outlet u visit,btohqsg
I mean  I go hotpot buffet I can usually eat 2kg mutton,btohqsg
then it's a sign to not visit shabu sai @ westgate next time,btohqsg
the one at nex not bad but it's probably too far,btohqsg
i mean if it’s buffet doesn’t rlly matter right,btohqsg
tbh if hotpot buffet  go Chinatown,btohqsg
anyway just checked that sukiya prices tend to be $1-2 more but they have q a few promotions usually lol,btohqsg
just go people house self hotpot,btohqsg
okay ! so ppl in the disc have been asking me to make more friends during jc orientation,btohqsg
but ppl (incl me) ady have their own friends,btohqsg
nah man as a introvert I have never joined any orientation,btohqsg
up to you fr like jc is only two years plus you’re in the same sch so,btohqsg
tbh more like 1.5 years bc the last half year you’re just mugging,btohqsg
did you stick with ur jh ppl,btohqsg
i had like one friend in my new class so i got mix around a bit,btohqsg
tbh I don't really have friends from jc,btohqsg
Mostly from secondary and a few from ns,btohqsg
actl yea our sch alot of ppl shy,btohqsg
i kept in contact with zero from before ns,btohqsg
at least go open house to see fcp la,btohqsg
Plus my year covid  I nvr even take part in cca,btohqsg
jc can be quite good if you actively try to make friends,btohqsg
but even my super outgoing mentee ended up just keeping to her class + cca,btohqsg
everything else is from stuff she joined,btohqsg
Aiya I tell u  the most important place to make friends is not jc but uni,btohqsg
also siyan dyk how they sort ori groups,btohqsg
my time and your time probs v diff bc last time no jae,btohqsg
how they did in ur time,btohqsg
uh bc last time only ip ppl so it’s fr the entire house go tgt. if need split then they just say these few classes go here etc,btohqsg
I heard they separate ppl whove been in the same classes in jh,btohqsg
do they use the talking hat,btohqsg
kongzi statue assigns you a house,btohqsg
I don't even know if I should join uni orientation,btohqsg
Chat  where would u guys reco for someone who nvr ate hotpot outside before,btohqsg
my time is just x number of sh classes in one house,btohqsg
then just try to balance numbers,btohqsg
there’s like multiple ori for uni so,btohqsg
hmm that makes me even more scared HAHAHA,btohqsg
I prefer just pop up outta nowwhwrre and start school straight xD,btohqsg
lol at least you get to skip ori,btohqsg
cuz I scared if I skip I dk anyone HAHAHA uni a bit diff I thought,btohqsg
idk if ite can skip anot,btohqsg
usually I think ori all can skip one,btohqsg
depending on where u want to or not......,btohqsg
I originally wanted to go Sec 5 then my school say cannot,btohqsg
Ya apparently sg don't like to retain students  my jc1 promos was 2U 3E and they still promoted me :/,btohqsg
I say I wan retain they can cannot,btohqsg
end up I went jc2 with like zero knowledge,btohqsg
i think for uni it’s best to make some friends at least from your faculty,btohqsg
Ight I guess I'll try go for it.....,btohqsg
like uni has its own system. no one gonna tell you exactly what to do so it’s nice to have ppl to bounce off,btohqsg
like if there’s one ori to go i’d say it’s faculty one,btohqsg
com engineer and environmental engineer  both nvr got in lol,btohqsg
i didn't know my year business cut off so low,btohqsg
Aite homie imma go thr someday,btohqsg
hmm i don't think I'm going overseas sadly.... XD,btohqsg
yeah  and also do u prefer one person one pot or one pot for multiple people,btohqsg
Uhhh I thought hot pot normally for more than 1 ppl?,btohqsg
tbh ill reapply if doesn't work then I'll stick to it,btohqsg
you can try to appeal for ur courses if that works in uni,btohqsg
I mean... can be many people but yall each person got individual pot one,btohqsg
i still have no idea whether i wanna go local or overseas uni  anyways i still have like 4-5 years to decide,btohqsg
Ohh I nvr tried cause I was under that impression initially HAHA,btohqsg
Hopefully u get into somewhere of your choice xD,btohqsg
the course I wanna go to is quite competitive i suppose  either going into aerospace or physics,btohqsg
and I'm only on duty tmr,btohqsg
technically mechanical also related to aerospace,btohqsg
true  but if i were to go on more hands on work then I’ll go for aerospace,btohqsg
i mean you gotta think about what you see yourself doing,btohqsg
aerospace is also quite saturated jobs wise but yea you’ve got time to think,btohqsg
i mean my decisions might change in the future so i also have to be prepared for that,btohqsg
i think either way it won’t matter much,btohqsg
my take is do what you want,btohqsg
A levels > PSLE > O levels (difficulty imo),btohqsg
means the 12 yo should alr take o levels based on this,btohqsg
PSLE was so difficult that I didn’t even do Os lol,btohqsg
even 12 y/o can score better for o levels than psle LOL,btohqsg
The self-actualisation has to kick in first,btohqsg
YA IKR BRUH O LEVEL SO EASY,btohqsg
My platoon even have a sfi allergic group,btohqsg
if n levels bell curve can save you then o levels bell curve can also,btohqsg
Sometimes I wonder what's the genz rice purity,btohqsg
rice purity is like higher the more pure?,btohqsg
Fk u i retake 3 times 🗿,btohqsg
how you retake 3 times? your score not enough to get into ri?,btohqsg
Yo I take that as a compliment,btohqsg
Wym how I just retake as priv cand cuz iw take As,btohqsg
The reason I almost failed promos is cuz I thought jc is as ez as o level,btohqsg
Oi I wan go also cannot go,btohqsg
as somebody who’s taking o’s in 2 yrs i see JC stuff is like iw cry alr,btohqsg
if I wanna take o’s I need to go sec 5,btohqsg
Aiyo don't overwhelm Urself yet  there's enough time for that,btohqsg
As in beat u up or beat you,btohqsg
im alr doing h2 physics and chem now 😵,btohqsg
oh cool I was in Sec 4NA this year,btohqsg
idk man PSLE is too dependent on the rate that diff kids develop,btohqsg
Ngl I feel like upper sec shld start teaching much more As stuff,btohqsg
bruh  my jc friends all go overseas won't even see em again,btohqsg
Which they are I think for new syllabus,btohqsg
Ya  but most of em prob wont come back,btohqsg
I otw to becoming  reclusive all the way,btohqsg
Very fundamental like no pt teaching,btohqsg
i think if they introduce J1 stuff in sec 4 then ppl will actually die,btohqsg
I get too agitated easily interacting with ppl,btohqsg
o level nuclear is like …,btohqsg
Me toooo  my dad say no money cannot go overseas HAHAHA,btohqsg
tbh even a level physics that touches on non classical stuff,btohqsg
remember that 99.9% of gamblers quit before they win big,btohqsg
actually jc stuff quite okay it's just cuz I nvr study at all in j1,btohqsg
So I struggled like mad in j2,btohqsg
A level physics is too basic for A level,btohqsg
my gripe with a level physics is,btohqsg
Cuz its mostly just o level physics part 2,btohqsg
I feel sec 3 q big jump for me alr,btohqsg
Oh ya I just realised also HHAHA,btohqsg
Idk is it because of my NA background aso 🗿,btohqsg
but my sample size too skewed,btohqsg
Omg its crying over h2 geog,btohqsg
you can do so much if you include more math in,btohqsg
NA was too slow for me but exp was too fast for me,btohqsg
My friend in China take geog they actually go dig fossils,btohqsg
Yea sec 1 NA to sec 2 exp,btohqsg
Don't defame the only subject I liked,btohqsg
Sec sch I went to the beach and threw oranges into the ocean,btohqsg
anyway guys go study past jc physics,btohqsg
Then sec 3 trip sci and now in MII'm that ODD BALL YOO,btohqsg
sg cuz no land space our geog u don't get to experience anything fun,btohqsg
It's not sg dw do tbf  it's literally just impossible to do without massive financial ctst of travelling overseas,btohqsg
True but that's the point why the geog is so boring,btohqsg
Then u just never had a gd geog education LOL,btohqsg
My sch went overseas for geog trip,btohqsg
Lupi lupi loopa loopa doobi doo,btohqsg
why i do h2 physics nvr bring me to nuclear plant,btohqsg
i do h2 math why never let me use black board and chalk,btohqsg
NA too slow for me  I still can’t get promoted to express,btohqsg
