N52 is one of the most reliable engines that bmw put out. But it doesn't make a ton of power. Especially for the e9x platform.,btohqsg
N54 has a ton of potential but it might blow,btohqsg
Yeah just gotta keep on top of your maintainence and it's mostly okay,btohqsg

But tbh not a fan of wide bodies on the e9x,btohqsg
