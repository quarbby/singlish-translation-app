Last time I've seen a sonata was years ago man,btohqsg
I like to joke that 599 GTO there are 599 in the world....OH SORRY THERE ARE NOW 598 LEFT THANKS TO THAT STUPID FUCK,btohqsg

what's with Ferrari and their love to sue,btohqsg
and give people cease and desist orders,btohqsg
they die die must be perfect,btohqsg
dowan to be associated with any bs,btohqsg
Taxi  both driver and passenger diedFerrari  the driver died but female passenger survived with crippling injuriesAlso  passenger was not his wife,btohqsg
Ferrari ia well known for enforcing their brand image,btohqsg
There was one guy in SG zhng his 458,btohqsg
Maranello banned him from buying a brand new or certified 2nd hand from Ital Auto,btohqsg
Actually that particular junction  the mistake the 599 gto guys made was fairly common,btohqsg
Because the pedestrian crossing between bugis junction and bugis+  and the main junction is so close,btohqsg
It was very easy to see the pedestrian crossing is green for car  u accelerate but never see that the main junction just 100m away is red,btohqsg
Only after the 599 crash  they synchronised both lights to turn green or red together,btohqsg
Actually the 599 GTO was a very wierd car in the lineup,btohqsg
It's branded as like a GTO racing type model,btohqsg
true  the gto badge was very random,btohqsg
But yet there is no racing league or 1 make category it was legal for,btohqsg
but that was more of throwing money for shits and giggles,btohqsg
hmm i'd say that it probably would've been the replacement for the 550/575 GTCs bah,btohqsg
The 599XX is like a Zonda R,btohqsg
It's not legal or sanctioned in any racing league or tournament,btohqsg
It's just for bored billionaires to play and wank themselves via petrol fumes on track days,btohqsg
