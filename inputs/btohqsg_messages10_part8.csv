you haven't approached HDB yet ah,btohqsg
Cos hdb told me only sell at 200k only ‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
wah how come a 14 years old flat can only be sold this cheap,btohqsg
but hdb ask me if u want higher can find agency but that one is ownwill Liao,btohqsg
I think you got my question wrong  how many years of lease left for your resale flat?,btohqsg
hmm not wise to stick to 4r in mature estate,btohqsg
can try 3r for hg projects,btohqsg
I use the hdb calculator it says at least 289k need cough up,btohqsg
But this calculation is I haven‚Äôt sell away my resale,btohqsg
Would HDB loan or bank loan be a better option? Heard from freelancers they tend to give less loan amount as compared to others.,btohqsg
bank loan u need pay 25% eh,btohqsg
I hear can take hdb loan first then switch to bank loan later  but not vice versa?,btohqsg
then how much if factor in selling the house?,btohqsg
$225k loan quantum if your pay remains the same plus you're the only applicant  otherwise two applicants can surely loan much more  the quantum from HDB is like 66x of your combined salary,btohqsg
Anyone knows if there is a group chat for melody spring?,btohqsg
I tot she was reported earlier.,btohqsg

Who banned you? Only banned the bitcoin spammers,btohqsg
Lol i thoughy they wanted to ban me,btohqsg

Hi guys  So to clarify this point means that we probably taking staggered downpayment  which we have to fork out 5% still during second appointment plus stamp duty etcRight.Then closer or during collection of keys is another HLE assessment plus the second 5%?Should the second HLE assessment fail then we have to fork out cash to topup or forfeit our position and the initial 5% gone.Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
Anyone know if there is grp chat for sky vista bukit batok?,btohqsg
Actually i have a question  so my husband have quit his last job. And now he is a self employed. Will this effect the HLE?,btohqsg
i mean when nearing key collection,btohqsg
He is currently insurance agent  so i was thinking whether will effect or not üòÇ,btohqsg
haha i think up to hdb how they wanna calculate ba,btohqsg
cause there's this mortgage servicing ratio,btohqsg
your monthly mortgage cannot exceed 30% of ur monthly income,btohqsg
so the loan amount is calculated in such a way that it wont be higher than 30%,btohqsg
both combined basic pay x 66,btohqsg
eh tiagong 5r cannot get grant?,btohqsg
Can if ur combined monthly income is below 9k.,btohqsg
heard from my colleague grant can only up to 4r application,btohqsg
because she purchased 5r without grant  non mature estate,btohqsg
Im not sure but iirc EHG was introduced in 2019. Prior to that was SHG  which could have the limitation?,btohqsg
I reckon your colleague book a flat before nov 2019 or something.,btohqsg
Hello guys! A quick question  during submission of the application under information for EHG & LOAN  there‚Äôs a question ‚Äúhave you completed your full-time studies within the past 12 months?‚Äù   should I put yes or no if I‚Äôm no longer studying for years.. ü§£ sound stupid but im new to this.,btohqsg
It's asking if u graduated recently,btohqsg
Hi guys if i wanna apply sales of balance flat  how do i do it? Cause it keep showing me  flats that i have to book which will be ready in 6 yrs time,btohqsg
Wait for SBF in Nov lol,btohqsg
SBF is only in May and Nov,btohqsg
Ohh.. but how do i go thru it,btohqsg
It's basically the same process as applying BTO,btohqsg
"Hi guys just another question on this  for the ""Have you completed your full-time National Service within the past 12 months?"" i put wrongly i put yes instead of no cuz i ORD 2 years back  will it affect anything? or do i have to re submit my application?",btohqsg
not sure if it affects anything,btohqsg
best is to call up HDB tmr morning before the application closes tmr 2359hrs,btohqsg
Ahh ok thanks a lot üôè,btohqsg
Hi there I just realised I made a typo error in one of the sections as well.You can actually amend the applicaiton before the end of the application deadline. So there is no need to cancel your current application to apply a new one.,btohqsg
"log into HDB portal ¬ª e-services ¬ª Residential ¬ª which ever option you applied to previously ¬ª Then scroll down all the way and look for ""Amend Particulars""",btohqsg
"""Amend Particulars"" should be on the bottom left",btohqsg
