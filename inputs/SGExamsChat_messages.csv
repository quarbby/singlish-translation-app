i havent added the / yet,btohqsg
Someone should design a bot just to flood chats,btohqsg
cause i rebuilt the entire bot,btohqsg
Your interesting is very ominous when punctuated,btohqsg
By this time everyone should know alr,btohqsg
Why not take a bank loan,btohqsg
How's everyone feeling after taking their results,btohqsg
Then you don’t have to be tied to the Government,btohqsg
I'll consider getting a student loan,btohqsg
Being tied to the government for awhile is not a bad thing,btohqsg
How will a math degree fund your loan,btohqsg
Being tied to the Government is better than not being tied to the Government when the global economy is on the downhill - and you don't know how it will be like when you graduate,btohqsg
In fact  it be a good thing. When you’re somebody govt deem worthy  private sector will be “green flag!”,btohqsg
Unless of course you have an economy crystal ball,btohqsg
Pls give me your economy crystal ball  I need it.,btohqsg
?????? How is Category Theory going to pay for itself,btohqsg
That's applied  and almost (actually  all) pure mathematicians hate applied mathematics.,btohqsg
Perhaps I should see my maths teachers for maths careers advice,btohqsg
I mean  if you’re really enjoying it  there’s no problem in being an academic,btohqsg
Lol then I assume they love money more than they love the only Dedekind-complete ordered field,btohqsg
Maybe one day “Insert realname here” will be on Math textbooks.,btohqsg
Yea but that’s for the PhD  he can still do Bachelor’s here.,btohqsg
TBH I don't see the problem of working as an academic overseas,btohqsg
And I don't mean only like fking top-tier magic like Oxbridge,btohqsg
I mean working in run-of-the-mill universities,btohqsg
Guys no matter what results y’all got  y’all should go ease and relax your mind first. Crying to yourself doesn’t help. Go look for your friends and family  have a meal or something. Do something you like! Maybe go out and get drunk if you like drinking  hahaLast year when I got my shitty results  I spent my night playing at Cow Play Cow Moo HAHAHA. Went home at around midnight. Felt a lot better after that. So just go free yourself today aites ! Nothing can be done to your results anymore so just move forward. For those who messed up  just do your best from here on ok!,btohqsg
US pay is probably better because many US people know how to make money in those positions,btohqsg
Eeyer don’t liddat leh. Don’t shame ppl for crying. I feel that it is valid to cry for one day. Then tmrw start planning your new way forward. We are not robots. We have emotions. Better to let it out than just swallow and hide it. Bad for mental health.,btohqsg
what no he’s saying dont be too upset HAHAH not shaming,btohqsg
I meant that you shouldn’t lock yourself in your room crying. Just cry it all out but don’t hurt yourself doing it. Let your fam cry with you also HAHAHA,btohqsg
No - it's because MIT professors know that they need to dig gold mines and only their pickaxes are trusted enough by gold mine owners,btohqsg
If your university (pickaxe) is not some Ivy League or historical name your pay likely won't be sky high either  and it'd possibly be very difficult to get consultantship fees,btohqsg
Easier to not worry about bullshit like Fracking (alternatively  magical Neural Network architectures) and worry about whether you can generalise relations between things,btohqsg
So in the end you chose?,btohqsg
But like wouldn’t it be sad for people that end up college single and college married to another college single by default?,btohqsg
Any history of college rejection? Hahaha,btohqsg
Interesting. Said nope to Japan and said YAAAS to Middle East.,btohqsg
You like exams??? Wait closed or open book?,btohqsg
But in poly you not study humans right?,btohqsg
H3 maths distinction is for scholars,btohqsg
More impt question is  did anyone your school get H3 DIST anything,btohqsg
Top science student got H3 Maths distinction,btohqsg
shit no more venti from you :(,btohqsg
I dunno what she is intending to do,btohqsg
Is ok I upgrade the deal for you,btohqsg
She's a foreigner so I dunno if she's able to apply for PSC,btohqsg
DIST only show nice nice only  it's pretty useless outside of SG unless you bullshit about it in US apps or whatever,btohqsg
i thought overseas unis look at H3s more,btohqsg
You can talk about your interest in furthering bla-bla with a H3 Dist,btohqsg
Some yes I'd assume most no,btohqsg
Thats a nice grade string ngl,btohqsg
T̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶i̶s̶ ̶w̶h̶a̶t̶ ̶H̶3̶ ̶M̶E̶R̶I̶T̶ ̶p̶e̶o̶p̶l̶e̶ ̶s̶a̶y̶,btohqsg
Friend:What did u get for As?Me:Aaaaaaa cbFriend:wtf call me cheebai?,btohqsg
Aynway foreigner probably no PSC - and the competitive international scholarships are fking hard to get so maybe the H3 dist not useless. But probably more community engagement blabla all still worth more in overall portfolio,btohqsg
the people there will think I fleccs,btohqsg
But the ppl here thonk you fleccs alr,btohqsg
So far no one here is flexing 90RP yet,btohqsg
fk 90 rp 80+ is where life is at,btohqsg
There was a penta A result slip here,btohqsg
That was posted by the person's friend,btohqsg
Idk man  did tm exist back in 1987?,btohqsg
Isn't that a name inside the study group,btohqsg
I think UK A and A* are equivalent to SG A,btohqsg
I saw your name before in Study Grp,btohqsg
You quit to rejoin chat today?,btohqsg
nope hahaha just bored so rejoin to c c look look,btohqsg
He is responding to the call out for perfect scorers,btohqsg
Wat are you trying to say about TMJC,btohqsg
It means the person got penta A,btohqsg
LOL TF haha are u? John,btohqsg
I am 3/7 distinctions away from perfect score,btohqsg
Did you know of a cher called Mrs kk,btohqsg
Oh dam is that the 1st 90rper in this chat,btohqsg
LOL i did la but i didnt join cos of that  didnt even saw that,btohqsg
You were called by the red strings of fate,btohqsg
Haha thanks btw How did ac fare?,btohqsg
Booted out of the mean RP 80 club,btohqsg
I blame it on COP increasing by 2 for our year,btohqsg
Can go med or law XD,btohqsg
Tsk nt that far away what ... hahaha AAAABBB? Gdjobbb,btohqsg
Thats the min score I wanna gets,btohqsg
Med is a terrible career. Law is... ... ...?????????,btohqsg
Welp I have the passion for med so...,btohqsg
Well  we had like close to 84 for the L1R5 7/8 batch,btohqsg
As long as you're not going med 'cuz my parents say so',btohqsg
Not going to make your life any easier but at least you choose it,btohqsg
Wait whut no hmt? Why u 7 subj oni,btohqsg
But I don't really include it,btohqsg
Yeah  I know what’s coming if I study med,btohqsg
Its not easy but I want it badly enough to not care,btohqsg
Ouh hahaha i see smart ass man 8 subjs,btohqsg
All I did was take subjects I liked,btohqsg
wow ur bf is smart which sch??,btohqsg
Ask him impart me some skills,btohqsg
'Kill me laaaaa' would be my reaction,btohqsg
6 yr undergrad 2(4?)+ years residency,btohqsg
Bruh that's TEN YEARS studying and treated like shit,btohqsg
If he stops at PGY-1 then just one year,btohqsg
He can open a go clinic after that,btohqsg
Will choose med if i could,btohqsg
So you intern for one year you are certified to open a gp clinic,btohqsg
GP-onwards it's likely easier....but IDK how GPs really feel TBH,btohqsg
Applying for PhDs is fkkkkkkking demoralising,btohqsg
Cuz I am not a Knight Henessy material,btohqsg
At least there’s the option for undergrad med,btohqsg
Basically optimisation and prefer technical side,btohqsg
If not gotta waster 4 years in another uni course,btohqsg
My algebraic geometry is fking shit,btohqsg
Pardon my dumb ass whats tat HAHAH,btohqsg
A lot of my results rely on high pure math,btohqsg
But TBH I rather ignore  and just use,btohqsg
She said “Don’t want to be a doctor”,btohqsg
Yeah then it would be a waste,btohqsg
That’s why you got to think very hard about your passion,btohqsg
I will consider further based on the results of my scholarship app,btohqsg
hmm probs trying medicine and dentistry,btohqsg
Even the Teaching internship programme has no lack of people signing up,btohqsg
Students growing up usually only know one profession,btohqsg
So they think they want be teacher,btohqsg
Now I know why I wanna do med,btohqsg
Cus I always get mc pon sch!!,btohqsg
Another cute sticker pack to the collection,btohqsg
Exactly. Please please please go gain some knowledge and exp about different paths  don't just rely on what you assume and read online and from family and friends.,btohqsg
A person with 8 points may not necessarily be intellectually inferior to a person with 6 points.But a cohort with 8 points more often than not is intellectually inferior to a cohort with 6 points.,btohqsg
Law of large numbers at play,btohqsg
Wrong. What about Law  Med  Engine LOL,btohqsg
MOE TS i cant apply cos of administrative hold ups :(,btohqsg
I'd not use the words 'intellectually bla' but rather 'academically inclined',btohqsg
Law of large numbers is about infinities - in no where in real life there is an infinity,btohqsg
Number of applicants may be higher tho :/,btohqsg
Number of people who want to become teachers plummets,btohqsg
I can only imagine myself being a private tutor aft it,btohqsg
Be like me apply during 2nd yr of NS lor,btohqsg
No matter what my TIP would be cut short by NS cause it’s 2 years NS  and starts and ends in Feb,btohqsg
U nvr know until u try,btohqsg
That’s what happens when all the rich kids go to one school,btohqsg
"The biggest factor is that you don't see lambo driving to ""random_name_here""",btohqsg
Anyone know JPJC A level result ?,btohqsg
Almost every single hci student i talked to said their teachers are shit,btohqsg
Actually not fair...they were all arts students,btohqsg
Student says X  hence X is true,btohqsg
Ye manSample size 6Not big enough,btohqsg
Dude  that's not even the problem,btohqsg
Even if the whole cohort says the chers are shit  doesn't mean that the chers are shit,btohqsg
The only thing you can conclude is that there is some animosity,btohqsg
That is the only possible conclusion,btohqsg
Students aren't the best judges of teachers,btohqsg
But if they describe how they teach,btohqsg
Considering how some of them are in TIP now,btohqsg
And comparing themselves to their teachers,btohqsg
Cause each student only sees a particular aspect of their teacher,btohqsg
If they are a bright student  the teacher ignores them during class and focuses on weaker ones,btohqsg
But yeah i agree is not fully accurate,btohqsg
Then they'll think that the teacher is shit,btohqsg
They just simply read off the slides,btohqsg
And a lot of other examples,btohqsg
Alternatively  bright students get preferential treatment - it depends on each teacher-student pairing,btohqsg
What do you want to be an example of not reading off slides tho,btohqsg
My ex-NUS Math Professor who taught me math  also 'read off slides',btohqsg
I'm just giving an example of how teachers who aren't shit may be seen as shit by some students,btohqsg
The difference is that his BEAMER presentations are fine,btohqsg
He speaks ALONG with the presentation,btohqsg
And he wrote a(many?) graph theory book before,btohqsg
So that's more street cred than he will ever need to teach,btohqsg
And it's not like you can't ask questions during lessons,btohqsg
But many students don't even ask questions,btohqsg
What you expect a teacher to do,btohqsg
A good teacher is one that makes lessons digestible,btohqsg
This. THIS.Every school is a good school. Is wrong.A lot of people always argue they produce different level of result.Govt rebuts good in a different way.However I say that it is false because of imbalanced opportunities.Every school may not produce the same results  but if the reason why some schools are lagging behind is because of resources  then they are not good schools.To truly assess abilities  the resources need to be constant. If not  to a certain extent your grades measure your access to resources. That is not fair.Every school is a good school once MOE makes it illegal for school to do shady things to hoard resources. Such as having a different answer key to be shared with other school  and answer key for your own use in your own school.Wtf priorities are wrong when the Teachers focus on impeding other students as opposed to helping your own students.,btohqsg
Just cos u write books doesnt make u good,btohqsg
Unless there's some stupid system like 'participation marks',btohqsg
ok you win lor. Go talk about Tournaments and shit,btohqsg
Is like just cos my friend had a math tutor who co-wrote tys answers published 2 books doesnt mean he will get a guaranteed A,btohqsg
And yes he didnt do well for h2 math,btohqsg
Personally I can't really think of any questions during class time,btohqsg
It's only when I go back do tutorial that I have questions start to emerge,btohqsg
Lol my 'book' isn't a TYS. Graph Theory isn't 'TYS',btohqsg
I dont blame profs from reading off slides in unis,btohqsg
Cos the content is too fkin abstract,btohqsg
Theres only so much u can simplify it further,btohqsg
Fffffffffff then how the teacher get student feedback?,btohqsg
If u read off the slides thats it u are just meh at best,btohqsg
Teacher can ask the class questions,btohqsg
And also  watching their body language,btohqsg
We can do this game-theoretically. Adversarially the class just won't respond  then how,btohqsg
By saying even if we have mostly public schools inequality of opportunities still exist?,btohqsg
🤔 This is basically saying students won't even 'best response' any strategy given,btohqsg
Basically  a 'strategy' is any set of decisions you make - inclusive of what others do (typically simultaneously  dynamic need solve separately)You clearly want to do the best you can  so you do 'best response' to whatever the other players do.,btohqsg
NUS maff will teach  dun worry,btohqsg
But students don't always want to do the best they can,btohqsg
At the end of the day  (basic) game theory has extreme assumptions about decision makers  such as being rational  infinite computing power ('oracle') etc.,btohqsg
Students who are motivated to do their best is one type of student,btohqsg
That's true  I'm not denying this  I'm not denying that basic game theory doesn't match reality very well,btohqsg
? maybe your school got elective on this,btohqsg
1 mod should be enough  dun go crazy,btohqsg
Relaxing optimality assumptions gets hard cuz then you need to really think wtf the players will 'really' do  which can be complex  I think 1 way you can do is some probabilistic approach ba,btohqsg
Actl IDK what econs game theory will do...,btohqsg
As part of microecons we had a small game theory section - and we play actual games,btohqsg
Then the prof say 'your performance will be graded' then WTF all students really solve for optimality ffffffkkkkkkkkkkk,btohqsg
The most ridiculous shit is when the games are clearly imbalanced like sellers have advantage  first-mover advantage  etc. etc. etc. Or asymmetric information.,btohqsg
And then I saw students playing to win like wtf,btohqsg
See your batch mates how greedy/hungry for grades they are lor,btohqsg
But... can tuition be construed as private education though,btohqsg
That's why we don't have private schools in SG except for int'l schools,btohqsg
Autonomous Schools are as functionally problematic too,btohqsg
They are more expensive  but not nearly private school expensive,btohqsg
Reminds me of how 50% of RI students live in HDB,btohqsg
Not talking about the daylight facing side of things  but under table.,btohqsg
I know only the 1st one  I assume the other 3 names also eleetus schools?,btohqsg
I'd say it's more concretized and formalised in UK.SG not say there isn't such bullshit  but I think eleetus private schools not yet one of them,btohqsg
No money doesn't disqualify you from the toppest of skools,btohqsg
It is certainly harder  but it is still a good chance,btohqsg
But money gives the rich an extra route to toppest of school,btohqsg
Fuck  this chat having some big brain debate moment,btohqsg
We just need someone to BERRRRRRRRNIE SANDDDDERS in here,btohqsg
THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY IS MESSED UP,btohqsg
THE TAX SYSTEM PUNISHES THE POOR DISPROPORTIONATELY,btohqsg
Compared to people who can't afford cars  or their own house their entire life,btohqsg
Basically people who  if you track their assets/liabilities with an 'accurate' account book  is PERMANENTLY in the red.,btohqsg
The top one percent shouldn't be get 50 percent of the income,btohqsg
Idk my experience in Uni challenges your theory  I feel like I missed out on so many opportunities earlier in life bcoz I’m Low SES.,btohqsg
FWIW these people will enjoy better standard of living than people in Africa  but you kinda still don't want to live in a small HDB you can't afford man,btohqsg
I only earn 620 a mth,btohqsg
aiya just use CEO/lowest salaried worker ratio  get biccer numbas,btohqsg
Like I see the ppl around me not just good at one thing  they good at multiple things that are unrelated to each other.,btohqsg
Then I find out that it stems from they very young alr exposed le,btohqsg
That's why education is so important,btohqsg
But I still can be classified here,btohqsg
The future of the child begins with the things they are presented with,btohqsg
Doesn't it just devolve into Marxist discussion,btohqsg
John Smith the kind of dad that will buy his 2 Yr old son calculus textbooks,btohqsg
That sounds nice  especially if can adapt to modern thinking,btohqsg
Dumb question  but isn't it an inefficient use of our society's time  money and resources if undergraduates don't end up working in an industry that is relevant to their degree?And isn't this a very prevalent problem currently  where a good majority of engineering undergraduates work in industries barely related to engineering?,btohqsg
I haven't thought far enough to design a curriculum for my hypothetical child yet,btohqsg
But I would like to expose them to tons of different things,btohqsg
(Actually I never read Spivak ever before),btohqsg
SG has no real engineering industry though,btohqsg
Please be my daddy in our next life.,btohqsg
then isn't that an even worse problem,btohqsg
The size of the engineering industry is already too small,btohqsg
we're training people for an industry we don't have,btohqsg
Or is so small that it doesn't warrant the number of graduates that we're pumping out on an annual basis,btohqsg
We don't have an industry  but we have real needs,btohqsg
PUB isn't going to be run by bankers,btohqsg
Engineering was just an example btw,btohqsg
NEA isn't going to be run by bankers,btohqsg
The problem is that it's impossible for 1 or 2 people to give the kids such a wide scope of education; you need to get people to help  and you often have to pay them,btohqsg
EMA is run by bankers  but the SP POWERGRID can't be run by bankers,btohqsg
You should run an experiment like polgar,btohqsg
ST ENG can't be run by bankers,btohqsg
ok but like the job industry is also changing so rapidly we can't rly ensure that what people study will eventually help them in work,btohqsg
I mean even if you don’t agree with your methods,btohqsg
Finance will be in SG forever,btohqsg
Top-tier magical surgery will be in SG forever,btohqsg
Unfortunately prostitution-run-economics isn't heavily encouraged by the government,btohqsg
Is finance reallyimpossibleto automate? Genuine question,btohqsg
And whatever you do  you need a proper Struct. Eng to look AT LEAST ONCE on blueprints,btohqsg
It's not  but you're not paying bankers to automate themselves out of the picture,btohqsg
When you say finances will be in SG forever  I assume you mean the finance job market will be in SG forever,btohqsg
At the very least  going to uni gives you opportunities to intern and gain working experience  give you overseas experiences  experiences with independent living   and gives you skills at managing projects  time management  learning,btohqsg
Many parts of it will be easy to automate. Some parts will be hard  but a very small portion.,btohqsg
Yes I mean that if JPM  Goldman  BNP  ANZ  etc leave Singapore we will be in a worse-off position that we never want to be in,btohqsg
Lots of skills you learn are applicable to any job,btohqsg
To those who believe the automation can invalidate something completely. Read “The Machine Stops”.,btohqsg
financial market of sg change too,btohqsg
you'll always have to learn new things anyway and adapt,btohqsg
Just more things that take up your time,btohqsg
? The current world pop is supported by automation,btohqsg
And no  you aren't going to go into the fields and grab soil,btohqsg
And no  I AM NOT going into the fields to grab soil,btohqsg
I think if you are the sort of parent that cares about their child's education it can be done,btohqsg
If you're really thinking about careers and jobs  start thinking about problems that we face as human beings. Jobs exist because there are problems to solve. Think that way and you will always find opportunities for work.,btohqsg
What happens when your problem exists because you need to create problems,btohqsg
I'm not going to name names here  but Donald J Trump,btohqsg
Prostitution started because incels didn't want to be virgins,btohqsg
The only people saying this are luddites,btohqsg
Well finance isn't 100% useless it's just that most people obviously aren't worth their paycheck,btohqsg
Just eat the rich can alr,btohqsg
Hence the problem is that there is no problem.,btohqsg
Sorry I'm biased against finance. A lot of the profitability in it comes from obscuring the rules of finance so suckers buy into plans that you know they will lose  or into plans you know you will win more.,btohqsg
But again  I know I am biased.,btohqsg
Is there even anyone who can quote legitimate reasons for why finance exists,btohqsg
Because people are stupid and naive,btohqsg
I've yet to meet a banker who can legitimately believe in what the bank exists for,btohqsg
They find problems when others don’t find it problematic because they have been desensitised to the problem.,btohqsg
Can la. Finance is legitimately important to help people maximize their financial resources and make better plans with how they spend. But people who go into it looking at how they can personally benefit  pervert the mission that finance can achievem,btohqsg
At the very basic level  helping people store money in a bank already helps with security and transfer.,btohqsg
I wonder if MAS raise interest will there even be any impact,btohqsg
Ok that's in the history books yes,btohqsg
*60+ RP people making angry noises*,btohqsg
Smart enough to be invited  too dumb to be included,btohqsg

Is it a boy or girl?,btohqsg
*bot gets wrecked in 10 minutes*,btohqsg
IT IDENTIFIES AS A DELICATE CREATURE,btohqsg
hope it doesnt spaz or crash like yesterday,btohqsg
ok im assuming this short silence means its working,btohqsg
if it spams I'm banning it,btohqsg
no no dont add it in here,btohqsg
it works fine when the bot is alone haha,btohqsg
ok the silence is unsettling somone tell me whether it worjs,btohqsg
Ok so it sends messages when you click stuff?,btohqsg
Feature Request: add SUTD thanks. Same spiel  with link to relevant places. IGP just say 'SUTD Admissions does not publish IGP',btohqsg
definitely will add more content now that it isnt crippled from errors,btohqsg
you hosting it from your computer?,btohqsg
HAHAHA dont make me use the old file and spam u back,btohqsg
Can you send an email to Prof Chong Tow Chong and ask instead  way fking above my paygrade,btohqsg
any other features i should look into,btohqsg
If not then Director Lim Su Fang,btohqsg
Ya but still  in case anyone thought serious,btohqsg
TBH I pretty sure the upper management collectively (thru meeting) decide not to publish IGP,btohqsg
And it's not one person's decision,btohqsg
no it doesnt work like that,btohqsg
Anyone know how NUS CS compares to overseas?,btohqsg
Top few in the world if I am not wrong,btohqsg
H2 Further math can retake as private candidate right,btohqsg
Meanwhile I'm here with a ACD/BBC,btohqsg
I only 6 subjects pleb mode,btohqsg
also wtf ruffles Institution half get 6 distinctions,btohqsg
Does anyone know the distinction rates are like for h3 chem for the new syllabus,btohqsg
Ah. Because I'm debating if it's worth trying to apply for overseas CS over NUS,btohqsg
If you want to compare to extreme famous unis  don't bother,btohqsg
are you aiming for any scholarships,btohqsg
for my sch 3/8 got distinction,btohqsg
Oddly enough  I heard CMU Undergrad Godlike  but its post-grad isn't as near god-like,btohqsg
I mean  I find that it's odd a uni reputation depends on what level you talking about,btohqsg
Ya  but doesn't matter I not RI,btohqsg
as compared to engineering courses what made u choose math?,btohqsg
Far from it  I actually abhor pure math,btohqsg
Apparently he was in industrial engineering,btohqsg
Don't ask me Mech or EEE. Industrial almost nobody knows either,btohqsg
because one of my supervisor who studied civil engineering told me about how 'engineering' is a facade,btohqsg
Without math there is no logic,btohqsg
he went on to talk about how buildings will collapse if he went on to become a civil engineer,btohqsg
hence he became a math teacher,btohqsg
But even other than that  Engin Math and pure math are very far apart,btohqsg
Most sciences will include varying degrees of math,btohqsg
Luckily enough  we don't do mathematics like Foundational Mathematics,btohqsg
No 1st order logic (ok I heard some of my engin friends in other uni went through 1 mod of it),btohqsg
"""I'm sorry professor  what was that word you just used?""""No  not that word  the word where you said 'today we are going through a pruuth'? What's a pruuth?""",btohqsg
But either way  no real focus on logic systems,btohqsg
a pruuuuuuuth is a set of (directed) logical statements,btohqsg
NLP is a hot area now,btohqsg
*forced to learn about number systems in different languages,btohqsg
Not sure how involved the linguists/linguistics scholars are,btohqsg
Tom Scott made a recent video about it,btohqsg
TBH some of the results are quite sick,btohqsg
Caveat: 3/8 people in your class are scholars,btohqsg
We are seeing progress in certain problems where le machine is beating hoomans,btohqsg
Don't really need 90rp to get scholarship,btohqsg
nah I have little to no chance,btohqsg
i guess it helps for local bond free uni scholarships,btohqsg
but govt scholarships yeah 90 is not a must,btohqsg
This economy  just go bonded la,btohqsg
You bonded to what sucky area,btohqsg
How can Ministry work suck that much,btohqsg
Ok actually I understand some areas really sucky but,btohqsg
ye I heard abt that but MOE is definitely fine,btohqsg
(This statement was made without proof but it's not like I can say otherwise/shrug),btohqsg
Oh ya  MOE should be ok tbh,btohqsg
One dangerous place I know is LTA,btohqsg
LTA scholarship requirements quite high  bond length quite long also  I'd say not worth it unless your life skill amazingly high,btohqsg
isn't the career progression there good,btohqsg
Anecdotal evidence of how they treat scholars has not been good,btohqsg
But I have a senior in LTA  he said he not dying last I saw him so I guess,btohqsg
most NUS students take 1-2 cs mods right,btohqsg
But I have peers who are now in LTA  can ask how he's doing later on,btohqsg
even if they arent in cs,btohqsg
Depends which faculty you are in,btohqsg
If you are in science some majors require you to take CS1010  which is an intro programming course,btohqsg
Enginnering also has madatory programming mods  as well as finance if I remember,btohqsg
You will find out more when you get in,btohqsg
I think by now only FASS don't have intro programming as a core module,btohqsg
Biz included one a few sems back,btohqsg
oh some engine courses also don't need,btohqsg

LTA is the very reason why I want to get out of the Uni course i currently got accepted into,btohqsg
Booking in is a sad time,btohqsg
I used to want to work with LTA. But recent times really showed me how dense the upper management can be in the way they handle transportation in Singapore. Normal staff are just pawns  scapegoats and puppets for them,btohqsg
Ok we can do something over the weekend,btohqsg
I used to intern for LTA  my impression is that there is a massive disconnect between the LTA on the ground and the upper management,btohqsg
just a reminder that 377a as a law still exists,btohqsg
Sir this is a Methodist institution,btohqsg
my mind says no but john's body says yes,btohqsg
ACJC stands for And Cocks Jocks Cunts,btohqsg
Yes of course. The bosses drive cars and yet try to prance behind the lines and enforce a car-lite society,btohqsg
I have to say though  different organisations in SG seem to suffer different levels of this. I wonder if PUB is also like this,btohqsg
Lol not even cheap cars  I see HQ area Merz so many,btohqsg
thats... pretty gay bro... 😳 unless...,btohqsg
I think this has to do with like Asian straight male culture because cars are like a sign of success,btohqsg
Meanwhile Minister Chan said he drives a Prius  anyone can confirm,btohqsg
upper management would look damn beta if they took public transport,btohqsg
Yep but LTA is a really bad one though,btohqsg
i saw his trademark prius outside his house,btohqsg
Ya Minister of Transport and SMRT CEO takes MRT on their first day of work to wayang  then they drive their BMW for the subsequent days of their lives,btohqsg
He said on public interview before. Something along driving the prius cuz most efficient,btohqsg
You haven’t lived until you see Mr Khaw on the train after doing a talk at Ruffles Institution,btohqsg
i am reminded of ruffles potato chips now,btohqsg
They’ve bought too many buses in recent times that they aren’t even using. They’re all rotting in the bus depots. They even put those that were in service for a period of time back to storage. They also introduced useless bus services to waste resources :”),btohqsg
Yes can we do like fun hang out things,btohqsg
Chances are I won’t ever get a chance to live like that LOL.,btohqsg
I feel like a boulder has been lifted from my chest after today,btohqsg
The thing is of all things LTA is known for  excellence is not one of them,btohqsg
With this  how do you even recruit anyone,btohqsg
So I suggest the Village Of Netherlands,btohqsg
what's there to do at netherlands five,btohqsg
They’re truly a shitty transport authority for a “developed” country,btohqsg
I have been told you only deal with ethanol in the lab and not outside,btohqsg
If you are willing to try I believe we can have a fun (not gay) time there!,btohqsg
ethanol in the lab is diluted,btohqsg
I do drink but only during festivities,btohqsg
I suppose this is considered a festivity,btohqsg
This is a cause for celebration,btohqsg
you can't deal w 100% ethanol on your hands LOL,btohqsg
