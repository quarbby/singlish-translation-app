GSWF is for applicants who are still schooling now lol,btohqsg
but when it's their turn to ballot  don't think most of them have the money,btohqsg
plus the sale of your house,btohqsg
if the pricing trend goes on  we can expect GSWF to hit 1m,btohqsg
combined pay must hit 7-8k for DINKs,btohqsg
keen to see the dropout rate,btohqsg
expect 4r to hit 740k at least,btohqsg
because by then shorter waiting time,btohqsg
referring to the most exp unit of 4r,btohqsg
followed by SBF > open booking probably,btohqsg
Open booking most flats not ideal so can't really compare,btohqsg
I am the first timer applicant  aim for tb  not sure for the chance,btohqsg
in terms of choices  resale is the best,btohqsg
Open booking more expensive than bto meh? It's leftover of leftover so I'm not sure,btohqsg
First thing is go ahead and ballot as long as your combined can hit,btohqsg
Those second floor near rubbish chute etc  in SBF nobody wanna take  go to OBF if more expensive ppl will take?,btohqsg
OBF normally means the project is completing soon  that explains the higher price since waiting time is much shorter  if one is desperate to move out  can't see why he or she reject an unit even if its next to the chute,btohqsg
if you have schemes to use  like PPS  have higher chance  laggi best if it's stack to another scheme  double combination!,btohqsg
. HDB SBFs are more expensive than BTO flatsWhilst HDB's Sale of Balance Flats are still subsidised by the government  they are still more expensive than BTO flats. However  they still cost much lesser compared to HDB resale flats.,btohqsg
though it never mentioned OBF is costlier  projects fall under this category should be closer to the completion date,btohqsg
wah Lao my BTO project that was launched 4 years ago still have SBF units lor,btohqsg
Will always have ppl give up along the way,btohqsg
that's why I'm looking forward to see the dropout for tb,btohqsg
last sbf  there was one on the 18th,btohqsg
may 2021 SBF has been launched!https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/sbf/intro__flats in dakota:cassia crescent 3R(ethnic quota 1 | 0 | 1)- #09-181  $343 000dakota breeze 2R(ethnic quota: 2 | 2 | 2)- #06-26  $278 500 for 99 years- #16-24  $272 500 for 99 yearsdakota breeze 4R(ethic quota: 1 | 1 | 1)- #14-38  $618 300pine vista 2R(ethnic quota: 3 | 3 | 3)- #10-08  $287 500 for 99 years- #08-20  $276 700 for for 99 years- #07-14  $218 400 for 99 yearsnothing much. dakota one flats not in this launch.,btohqsg
Bida 5 room more ex than tb 4 room. Not many dropouts for 1st round,btohqsg
I thought u think that drop out will be due to not being able to afford,btohqsg
actually ah one of the best conditions to apply tb is if your combined CPF have 200k,btohqsg
I mean that's when you're getting keys  6 years later,btohqsg
2013 BTO project - Telok Blangah ParcView is bounded by Telok Blangah Street 31 and Telok Blangah Heights  approximately 10 minutes (1.0km) walk away from Telok Blangah MRT Station.In terms of pricing  excluding grants  Studio Apartment from $113K  3-room from $304K and 4-room from $445K.,btohqsg
about $20k increase per year for 4r,btohqsg
anyway telok blangah MRT is like 6 mins walk on a relaxing pace,btohqsg
hmm actually not fair to compare since this tb project is 400m away to the MRT as compared to 1km of the previous project  but still the increase is still a lot,btohqsg
still can't get over why is it much more expensive than dakota one,btohqsg
is it due to this pandemic eg  need more cost to hire FWs,btohqsg
but cannot be since dakota one was launched during the pandemic too,btohqsg
Telok blangah more prime than dkt,btohqsg
Good view  point block  near sentosa,btohqsg
Those delivery possession date display in hdb are they really accurate estimate or usually completed earlier?,btohqsg
I think used to be quite accurate but you may be able to collect key earlier. Due to covid  current projects mostly collect keys after the estimated date,btohqsg
But new launches idk if alr taken the delays into account,btohqsg
Hi can someone kindly advise us. We have a very high queue number for Feb BTO. While waiting for our queue are we allowed to apply for SBF flats in this cycle ?,btohqsg
As long as you didn't book any flat,btohqsg
Currently i already pay the option fee for $2000 tampines greencourt. If i apply for this current SBF  will it forfeit my current application?,btohqsg
you have to cancel first if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
can't get back the option fee too,btohqsg
you confirm can get for this SBF?,btohqsg
I think aft cancel 1 yr cannot apply right,btohqsg
unless you want to try BTO for next year,btohqsg
