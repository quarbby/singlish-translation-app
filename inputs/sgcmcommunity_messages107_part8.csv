Not a fan despite being a boomer lol,btohqsg
@Xipengstinger 2023 is the last one alr,btohqsg
only 400 available worldwide out of 1k leh.. 400 to US  200 to Korea,btohqsg
This one isn't coming to Singapore apparently,btohqsg
As c&c announced they're replacing the stinger with the ev6 in the line up already,btohqsg
The last unreg stinger was sold recently,btohqsg
The last C&C Stinger was sold already.,btohqsg
All Stingers for SG are on the roads already.,btohqsg
wa i wish i was the 5.5million canberra doode now,btohqsg
Stinger not much ppl buy anyway,btohqsg
It was alright price a year back. 215 999 for a 3.3 V6 & 165 999 for a 2.0It was even cheaper at 2020 for the 3.3L going 160k lowest. I doubt you can find any 3.3L car with that power(365bhp/510Nm) and features set at that price.It was a car not for the masses for sure cause Singaporeans loves their turtle SUV cars.,btohqsg
U are right  ppl either buy suv or nice sport cars. Stinger in the middle,btohqsg
Either ppl buy siroccoo or type r to play or next level is conti liao,btohqsg
But overall kia is a practical car to own for family or daily use,btohqsg
cupra are.. SUVs tho. Different appeal and demography.megane rs maybe but still Stinger is more sedan not a hatchback.Personally would classify those cars as diff target audience. It would be fair to challenge sedan cars to it.,btohqsg
Diff preference for sure. Again I would still say worth the cost back then for it's class & type. Very hard to compare across other types of cars.,btohqsg
STINGER IS A NICE SPORTS CAR!! ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°,btohqsg
Hanor! It will take 20 years off my age instantly!,btohqsg
Hi got selling Subaru Impreza hatchback auto? I want coe expired longer,btohqsg

May i know any one uses stp oil?,btohqsg
I just used Cataclean for my Catalytic Converter Cleaning / Fuel Injector.,btohqsg
I also used Amsoil Engine flush before oil change.,btohqsg
If your car is Ard 2yrs or 100 000kmIt's better to do cleaning of your throttle body  airtake manifold  valve & Catalytic Converter.Market rate $288-$300Walnut blasting or Chemical Manual cleaning(someworkshop using Amsoil Power form) < this is more thoroughSome workshop  use amsoil powerfoam and liquidmoly Catalytic Converter cleaner in the Vacuum tube and rev the engine to clear carbon,btohqsg
Steam blasting the system. Like what they do with oil storage tanks.,btohqsg
Budget decarbon at capsautowerk$38 amsoil powerfoam$68 liquid moly catalytic converter cleaning.Thorough cleaningTry Grand Auto Garage$245? New gasket for intake valve area.Manually cleaning intake valve  manifold  throttle bodyTake out and brush.,btohqsg
I heard German cars like cranberry,btohqsg
TECHNICALLY pops and bangs isnt illegal per se,btohqsg
I meant no Catalytic Converter ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

Early morning cold start smells wonderful,btohqsg
Nothing beats the fresh scent of exhaust,btohqsg
Someone should make that into a car scent.,btohqsg
I remember PA told me their tunes are illegal LOL,btohqsg
Smell of exhaust  tar  burnt rubber. Call itâ€¦ Nurburgring For Life,btohqsg
Or just go JB and clear carbon,btohqsg
Peopleâ€™s Association!!!??? I love the government!!!!,btohqsg
But maybe if I put in my rickshaw,btohqsg
Idk. When I got a quote for an MTM tune  he said wonâ€™t pass inspection.,btohqsg
No use if the carbon is hardened already.I see mechanic manually remove it also very difficult ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
That means itâ€™s a good tune,btohqsg
Maybe this is a FAST CAR THINGS,btohqsg
Wonâ€™t pass inspection? OK APPROVED! WHEN CAN DO FOR ME!,btohqsg
