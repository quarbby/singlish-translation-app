Recently switched all my Fairprice purchase to Trust CC. So irritating that their definition of spend outside FP group doesn't include excluded spend which means no insurance premium payment. I mean I understand if you don't allow me even to earn the 0.22% linkpoints but to not even allow to include in the spend outside FP group. That's just pure irritating on your definition,btohqsg
you mean tap your UOB supp card directly? If so then yes.,btohqsg
@jj000111  I will let@ChrisHMSGdecide if this 'hack' should be posted in here,btohqsg
