If you wanna believe Vettel's retirement is real  then you can don't count.,btohqsg
I personally believe he left AM cos of the stroll family too,btohqsg
you look at Vettel... with the beard and all.  It was time la,btohqsg
the feller doesn't even clean himself up,btohqsg
i used to not like Stroll too. but times and opinions change. can see the improvement la. cant discount that.,btohqsg
after he left i think he shaved and became like the old him again,btohqsg
he honestly looked more like a tennis player then a F1 driver last year,btohqsg
i think he did improve also,btohqsg
But i still think he's wasting a seat in F1. LOL,btohqsg
there are definitely faster drivers out there. They just lack exposure  funding  opportunity etc.,btohqsg
can give to charles Leclerc younger brother,btohqsg
And stroll have the benefit of everything cos of his father,btohqsg
lost faith in Leclerc when last year he was almost begging the team to ask sainz let him pass,btohqsg
cos big teams wont sign him,btohqsg
He's stuck with his dad to build a championship car,btohqsg
But he have to beat his own teammates first,btohqsg
which he hasn't done so yet,btohqsg
he knows where he's at. he won't be looking outside too. so lucky they got a good car this season too,btohqsg
I'd say  alonso got lucky he got a good car,btohqsg
We shall see this season la,btohqsg
See if stroll can change my opinion  or your opinions,btohqsg
He have a proper car now  can he consistently beat the better drivers in the big teams,btohqsg
he know de... he rather not be in f1 den to get a horrible car,btohqsg
i just hope Ferrari picks up. lol,btohqsg
But you want to see real talents in F1  there are rookies that came and proved themselves  like lando  russel and charles.,btohqsg
"Stroll has never done anything so far that made people think  ""wow he's good  but in a shitty car""",btohqsg
russell will be top sooner or later,btohqsg
lando use F1 game to practice hahaha,btohqsg
I think he alr is. I think he's better than bottas  and he's almost as good as hamilton  or maybe better,btohqsg
He just needs a car that can perform,btohqsg
ya he in 2nd car so might not get upgrades,btohqsg
downshift problem but still flying away 😂,btohqsg
𝙃𝙖𝙧𝙩𝙖 𝘿𝙪𝙣𝙞𝙖(translated as Worldly Treasure from Malay)Maserati GranTurismoTrying out my Sony A6000 for edits for the first time  I'd say it's alright with the kit lens  though its limitations are becoming clear with more use.It's been raining so much these past few days so I wanted to capture the lack of warmth with the tones of the background (done in Lightroom). Last pic is a concept that is warmer overall but decided not to do.What an cool car to see in person  in my neighbourhood carpark no less.∇∆∇∆∇∆∇∆∇∆∇∆∇∆∇∆#sony#sonysingapore#sonya6000#maserati#singaporecars#v8#photographyhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CpcQH-VuC3t/?igshid=MWMzM2Q4ZmE=,btohqsg

@hayleescdwha now photo not alone one ar,btohqsg
dont think too much guys HAHA. Im just updating things :3,btohqsg
But ar why your head look so small,btohqsg
It's all fun until the clean up,btohqsg
but that day i cleaned up by driving thru some puddles so not so bad 😅,btohqsg
hello morning!! weee today we have GE6 with a lot of goods🤩🤩things to look out for:- BC coilovers- HKS midpipe (w cert)- KAKIMOTO GT Box 06 & S (w cert)- gauges- rims- intake- bumpers etc!* do read pinned msg for dealing details!!,btohqsg
In case u need hoard more parts,btohqsg
The gauge pod cluster sibei cool tbh,btohqsg
hi can any1 recommend whats a good starter camera?,btohqsg
don’t invest too much on the body of the camera  go for good lenses,btohqsg
Actually even a camera from 10 years back paired with a nice prime lens  photos will be great,btohqsg
You can try APSC first before splashing on full frame,btohqsg
I think A5000 or A6000 series is a good start. Carousell also cheap,btohqsg
Lens also can use for sony DSLRs,btohqsg
For what sia itasha by myself,btohqsg
