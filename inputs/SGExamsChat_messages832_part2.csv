Young people in Singapore are prioritising their careers and financial security over goals like getting married  according to a new study.It also found that two in five youths aged 22 to 29 in 2022 had never been in a relationship.https://str.sg/4z9PD,btohqsg
because yes meritocracy does allow people adequate access to education,btohqsg
the kind of learning they have will be different,btohqsg
those in wealthier families can afford better and more tuition,btohqsg
they can afford better study resources better stationeries better study furniture they can get their own personalised room thats quiet and conducive for studying,btohqsg
but those in poorer families cannot get such nice amenities  they will be deprived of top notch tution  good stationeries good study furnitures  they may be living in a house where they are crammed with their siblings in one room and its not conducive,btohqsg
and lets say both the student in wealthy family and a student in poor family gets raw 6 for o levels,btohqsg
do you really think the both of them put in the same amount of effort into achieving that score,btohqsg
or do you think that one of them had to put in more effort to achieve that score,btohqsg
meritocracy doesnt cover some other imbalances in education,btohqsg
education is the best example of meritocracy anyway because its based on merit instead of status like gender age skin colour ethnicity blahblahblah,btohqsg
I feel like ur arguement is diff leh,btohqsg
Mertiocracy is about the end result of education/academics,btohqsg
apprantly he was injured after first round,btohqsg
like is it fair to people,btohqsg
"I wld assume fair in ""rewarding"" people",btohqsg
Since thats the end goal of meritocracy ig,btohqsg
"I guess ur argument is more like meritocracy isnt ""blind"" to external factors and hence therefore unfair",btohqsg
I disagree with this statement as meritocracy is a assumption made by Bosses and Hiring professionals.The assumption here is that the journey to attain your qualification was deemed to be of a certain caliber of difficulty in the hiring personell eyes.Such difficulty could translate to skillsets being learnt or formed which they deemed would be beneficial to your posting.However certain skillsets learnt may not be redone or were only attained through a multitude of factors which may never apply at work.Eg. You were hired as a bus driver because you had spent 10 years driving a ambulance. The bosses made the assumption that due to your years driving ambulances  you could better handle stresses on the road and drive safer than any other potential employees that maybe had none.They however failed to account that the length of a ambulance and bus vary significantly  the piriority and advantages given to as a driver for emergency reasons etcThey still hired you over someone that spend 2 years driving a tour bus solely because of the reasonings mentioned.Hence like this example  a multitude of factors was given to you driving a ambulance which allowed you to gain the skillsets seen by bosses. However these factors would not be available to driving a public busso bosses can't simply make the assumption that you will retain the skillset to drive a public bus and hence use that reason to hire you over someone elseHence meritocracy will never be fair.,btohqsg
Yeah  and add on the fact that you are required to have a bus license to operate the bus safely.,btohqsg

‚ÄúHow am I going to pass my O-Levels?‚ÄùAfter the Mobile Guardian hack  secondary school students in Singapore discovered that years of notes were wiped clean from their devices  with no way of recovering them. And for some  their prelims have started:https://cna.asia/3AcIxzf,btohqsg
do it the old school way,btohqsg
write on paper is the best,btohqsg
thats why i write multiple notes on comp  paper and phone in case technical issues or losing my paper,btohqsg
At this point if your prelims have started and youre still referring to your notes,btohqsg
No cus i dont read notesüî•üî•,btohqsg
This fear of uncertainty will constantly be something you will think about once in a while. It‚Äôs recurrent and over time you will just have to live with the understanding that you can never be fully prepared to face the future.You can only face it with open arms and seize every opportunity given. If it‚Äôs bad  lessons are learnt. If it‚Äôs good  you reap the rewards you sow.You see as humans  having a mindset that can think for the future is a excellent trait but if you don‚Äôt have it  you won‚Äôt loose out massively.Ask any elderlies if they ever envision that they would be living in a 1st world country as as kids  many would have never believed it.Those kids are now us,btohqsg
can people see your profile when you leave a message on leo match bot ? sorry i didn't know where to ask this,btohqsg

No   I trust in Fate and whatever it brings   I believe one way or another it's something that will be helpful  for me,btohqsg
Nothing in this world is fair   and for a good reason.,btohqsg
you believe in fate because it has only been kind to you,btohqsg
Not rlly.. Depending on what you are talking about . Academics ? Nah my O's and PSLE are both terrible ( barely scrapping 200 and high double digits for my O's)  in academics . Life ? Well  my family is not that rich and I do not have an exact  normal family.,btohqsg
I'm not the worst case but I'm also not the best.,btohqsg
yeah exactly if you think fate has been decent to you  then i guess it's okay to trust fate whereas others are not as lucky  think about those with disabilities or cancer  do you think they will ever trust fate again? imo theyd resent it,btohqsg
Most people will if they have issues.,btohqsg
