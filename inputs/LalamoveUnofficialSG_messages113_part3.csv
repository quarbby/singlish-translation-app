Means personal shopper . The customer wants you to help to buy a certain items. Upon acceptance of job  call the customer to request for payment of the items to be purchased via Paynow or bank transfer you u. Without payment don’t buy.,btohqsg

Think he coming from the food platform mentality where jobs are assigned. It happens quite a lot there  deliver to ulu place then no job.,btohqsg
Why pickup hero the price all so Low😂,btohqsg
That's why nobody do. Can't cover patrol also,btohqsg
Basically dun come woodland   yishun n sembawang. This 3 places horrible. Once out many driver there to snatch. Sure lose de. I stay here I know. So choose your delivery area carefully,btohqsg
Depends bro. Sometimes we also cannot expect to wait and wait at same location. If at woodlands  got job at admiralty or sembawang lan2 bid only  better got something then got nothing.Somemore now is Durian period  a few vendors that I took from are asking if want to do for them perm for 3-4 weeks.,btohqsg

Especially Yishun. Sometime u will wonder why Yishun no jobs 1,btohqsg

Hiii just curious what do you all think about the lalamove platform and etc🤔,btohqsg
Also is it common to get like suspension/ban even after appealing?🤔,btohqsg
As in like the agents and like how they deal with difficulties and weird situations though🤔😂 I think the app itself it not bad also but the $ can be better🤪,btohqsg
I started not long so I wanted to know more,btohqsg
Llm price is 1 of the highest for delivery platform liao. If u find it not good enough then think u shldnt do,btohqsg
He's just being honest. To me it's better than sugar coating our answers. Delivery is not an easy or comfy job. If u can't take straightforward honest reply  then isn't it the same as u can don't read or reply to his answers,btohqsg
Like I said nowdays answers must be sugar coated 1,btohqsg
Tdy so weird. Managed to get the +8 n now another +4,btohqsg
