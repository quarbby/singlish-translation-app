My poly IT easiest alr‚Ä¶.everything can be self taught,btohqsg
That is basically my poly grading,btohqsg
Then my class can complain to the school and get our grades from F to D,btohqsg
It‚Äôs basically trying to do the bare minimum,btohqsg
Bare minimum to get each batch of its students through,btohqsg
The only reason why rp is has not closed down is because the poly is one of the most active schools for the govt,btohqsg
Makes the most money for govt,btohqsg
if yalls are comparing schools based on skills and grades rather than quality of courses / what you are passionate in learning  idk what to tell yalls,btohqsg

The prob is like at this juncture I genuinely feel there's a 99% chance I'm going to fuck up quite a few subjects in my rxams,btohqsg
on the day i collected my results  i was mentally prepared to sign lmao,btohqsg
i was considering doing a random major so at least i can come back as senior officers with higher starting pay,btohqsg

well just tell your encik lor see what they guide you  when i first enlisted  they got asked anyone interested to sign  then those that raised hand  they got transferred to the regular platoon,btohqsg
oh wa then i not sure,btohqsg
so i don;t know what am i supposed to do,btohqsg
i mean is it confirmed you c9 or you haven't gone for the check up and just guessing,btohqsg

But a fancier way of saying it,btohqsg
So basically if in 10th percentile youre like,btohqsg

Damn that is a good scoring class,btohqsg
i wanna do life sciences in uni,btohqsg
thats what i want to stody for sure,btohqsg
but i have no clue after that,btohqsg
like i if i want continue rite,btohqsg
and do research or some shit,btohqsg
the pay is shit thats one,btohqsg
Dw in every course there‚Äôs always a job position with a high pay,btohqsg
Just that it depends how many people are aiming for that course which will diminish your chances of it,btohqsg
If you study it more and you‚Äôre passionate for it  go ahead! It means lesser competition with such a choice,btohqsg
but then i go all my animals here,btohqsg
You‚Äôre certain about the course so go ahead  your animals you can think about how to treat them along the way while planning !,btohqsg
What is the Career progression of that course anyways,btohqsg
Hey but you are learning to be a responsible caretaker,btohqsg
my hobby also is my side hustle,btohqsg
In my mind early childhood career progression is just teacher - principal,btohqsg
i make like 500 from my isopods,btohqsg
Well that is basically like a brick wall,btohqsg
Techhhnically not  it‚Äôs mainly built on passion  to nurture young mind to become great people,btohqsg
Weiii don‚Äôt be so mean siaüò≠üò≠ Taking care of kids are so cute when they love you back fr,btohqsg
As a part time childcare teacher it‚Äôs acc fun,btohqsg
This is why you choose early childhood over actual primary or sec school kids,btohqsg
YA LOR SO ODDLY SPECIFIC BRO,btohqsg
Bruh I could see the flame of teaching slowly burning out through one of my sec school teacher eyes gradually through the year,btohqsg
Omg imagine being in sec sch lmaooo dealing with broken toilets 24/7,btohqsg
My principal had to seal off a whole toilet,btohqsg
If there‚Äôs a will  it‚Äôs possible to change that habit  you can always have a chance to make them better kids to relieve their parents stress,btohqsg
bro a whole toilet is outright madüò≠,btohqsg
i truly believe that to change a sec school kid...they actually have to face some sort of trauma,btohqsg
if not their dead bolted mindset is legit goated,btohqsg
My core memory was getting screamed at for tripping over my teacher,btohqsg
i joined sec 1 in 2017  i withnessed a class canning in sec 1 then a cohort canning in sec 2,btohqsg
that one class canning in sec 1  sealed my class's fate as one of the most notorious class of my school,btohqsg
in sec 1  one of my classmate took a baboo whip to his buttock infront of the whole class,btohqsg
Welp there‚Äôs not much to do if it‚Äôs officially diagnosed‚Ä¶ BUT IT HASNT BEEN SOOOO yes!! You could discipline them if things go out of hand,btohqsg
when u fk up once and have to endure hell for 3 years,btohqsg
i lost count of how many teachers my class made cry during my 4 yrs...my sec 5 class was one of the nicest,btohqsg
by the end of sec 1  both my class form teachers were sent to imh,btohqsg
one had been teaching for 17 yrs  the other around 8-9 yrs,btohqsg
then sec 2  we had a concurrent discipline comitee spotcheck every other week because some of my classmates always love to bring contraband to school,btohqsg
our track record by sec 2 was alr in the dumps,btohqsg
the usual contrabands like lighters/cigs...vapes glue penknives...but also others like butterfly knives  firecrackers was also bought to class by my classmates,btohqsg
I Hope they‚Äôve changed for the better forwarding,btohqsg
oh i know they changed..but idk if its for the better haha. butterfly knife guy dropped retained then drop out without n levels....firecracker guy went to culinary school (prob for the better),btohqsg
yep that school logo is interesting alright,btohqsg
he got a yt channel  he post bowling farting and firecracker videos,btohqsg
bruh got 1 guy In my sec school class kena caned idk how many times since sec 1. It was for stuff like asking a junior to have s*x wif him.,btohqsg
He kena sent to the principal many many times,btohqsg
He became friends wif the discipline comm tchers,btohqsg
He stalked my cca junior b4,btohqsg
Everytime after caning he come to class and start joking about it,btohqsg
Istg my class was so problematic,btohqsg
my cher told my class when we in sec 1 that we were the worst class in the school,btohqsg
comes a time when you know canning just dont work anymore,btohqsg
i mean sec 1 is like the breakin period for sec school i guess,btohqsg
my class was notorious for all 4 years,btohqsg
openly sexual couples in lesson  teacher-student r/s also got,btohqsg
depends what you mean by shit,btohqsg
i know a classmate alr has a child like 2 yrs back,btohqsg
My class so noisy got one time in sec 3  that my math cher just packed her stuff and left the class b4 class ended.,btohqsg
some of my other classmates even attended as bridemaids to this female's classmate's wedding while she just finished sec 5 equivalent,btohqsg
yea  married young af...alr got child  used to follow her insta always see her posting ig stories about keeping the child,btohqsg
oh ya that same guy I think wanted my cher daughter to be his gf or smtg,btohqsg
