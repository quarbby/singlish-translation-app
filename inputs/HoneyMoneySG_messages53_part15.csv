Hi All  Sorry for the weird question i very blur because there's a lot of CCWhat Credit card do you recommend for  Transport & Buying stuffs online? Like shopee/Tiktok  etc. Also its good if there's installment payment too.,btohqsg
Some card requires you to spend minimum $600 per month or consecutive $500 per month for three months. Then can give you benefits.,btohqsg
Actually my singtel bills and stuff can add up to 500+ every month already,btohqsg
I am mainly using UOB EVOL.https://youtu.be/2j2G936wpJI,btohqsg
8% is not effective rate. Effective rate is 6.667% because only first $250 from mobile n first $250 from online earn 8%. The rest of $100 earns 0.3% only. Average is 6.667% from minimum $600 spending.,btohqsg
Not sure what 'instalment payment' you're referring to...Most retailers will offer credit card interest free IPP for your purchases  above a total certain amt...,btohqsg
