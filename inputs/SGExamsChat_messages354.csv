My ex secondary school was manjusri,btohqsg
The best sec school is pei hwa,btohqsg
‚ÄúOnly bhuddist funded secondary school in Singapore‚Äù,btohqsg
Had a classmate who would make train sounds randomly in sec class,btohqsg
Everytime I do a paper its the same thing,btohqsg
Dw  I ended my sec 4 year with 19 for n levels...I got 28 for sec 4 prelims,btohqsg
Bedok how are you so free,btohqsg
I am scared of you now,btohqsg
he got all A‚Äôs for promos,btohqsg
Bruh my school did not even penalise those who pon school,btohqsg
My school legit said...‚Äùit‚Äôs their life  it‚Äôs their choice‚Äù,btohqsg
cos go home can study more,btohqsg
Well at least the principal said that to the cohort during a back to school assembly,btohqsg
Btw any of y‚Äôall seen public canning in school b4?,btohqsg
I want to be spanked tho,btohqsg

I saw a class canning in sec 1  cohort canning in sec 2,btohqsg
Then the discipline master dont want cane,btohqsg
Sec 1 classmate with a iq of 174 decided to steal,btohqsg
@chemcereh how do u get a for gp ah,btohqsg

Damn y‚Äôall are Top scoring folks,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall have like scholarships lined up,btohqsg
I reached my peak oso tbf,btohqsg
That moment you realise nearly all secondary schools have more Express classes than both NT and NA combined,btohqsg
My cohort have 4 exp  2 NA 2 NT,btohqsg
My cohort 2 exp 2na 1nt,btohqsg
I am hoping to get 80,btohqsg
From secondary school G3 to JC H3,btohqsg
They are revising the education system  I think last sec cohort 2024,btohqsg
Psle is diff from o/n levels which is diff from alvls,btohqsg
least we can say  we took the path less travelled,btohqsg
Can say we tried for express,btohqsg
Apparently by 2025  everybody who goes secondary school will only be there for 4 years if you don‚Äôt retain,btohqsg
in J1 and first half J2,btohqsg
Hard to do sec 5 with the G system,btohqsg
The new psle scoring system... lmao 46-64 is a pass,btohqsg
Thats fair if u ask me,btohqsg
Someone was smoking writing up that,btohqsg
If I took the new PSLE,btohqsg
If i convert to new system i wouldnt be able to go express,btohqsg
hours and hours spent wasted into thinking wtf is a non inertial frame of reference,btohqsg
Someone scoring a above passing score should not be getting the same grade as a failure,btohqsg
See no evil  hear no evil,btohqsg
"ashash... in the board games u said ""fisiks""",btohqsg
See no evil  hear no evil!!!,btohqsg
I mean true but then the population of primary 6‚Äôs are decreasing every year,btohqsg
I will go back study in 12 minutes,btohqsg
You know like the rj and hci people get all the As,btohqsg
Can enter the course u want,btohqsg
the rp that can enter ur desired course is a good rp,btohqsg
One that gets u a career with 20k/month,btohqsg
I can already see the impact of the birtrates of 2010 seeing how many primary schools are closing,btohqsg
It's like emath you not RI you got lesser chance A1 meh,btohqsg
Random fact: Prostitution is legal in Singapore,btohqsg
Yeah i get his point but it generalises over some who vouldnt get the grades they want,btohqsg
Losing 4 marks in a 20 mark chem qn,btohqsg
It's a correlation but not really a causation,btohqsg
Damn learning some new words here,btohqsg
is the diference between B and A,btohqsg
Uni is where the real bellcurve is at,btohqsg
Uni grading is based on ur percentile  not actual marks,btohqsg
Yea I just didn't bother about the curve anymore,btohqsg
Curve good only if your prof recurve,btohqsg
Guys moderation helps the bad students,btohqsg
Anyone intrested in seeing my hot wheels collection from a few months ago lol,btohqsg
They will seperate the top few from the rest,btohqsg
People work to spend on food and clothes...but me on toys,btohqsg
Curve is a double edged sword,btohqsg
This is a few months ago,btohqsg
Cannot give everyone A also  but imagine if someone good enough for A but cuck them by dropping their grade coz they did not match up to their peers,btohqsg
You don't only pit them against the papers  you pit them against their peers too,btohqsg
I also have a collection of Tomica cars,btohqsg
Recently met a online Friend  he was the 2019 poly batch...graduated with a >3 in dit,btohqsg
I messed up so much last time,btohqsg
Bellcurve is a thing overseas too,btohqsg
like i am pretty sure I got 40,btohqsg
I just don't fight the bellcurve,btohqsg
It sucks cause you see your old tests and see how dumb you wete,btohqsg
That's only for some majors lah,btohqsg
Could the amount of poly make. A difference?,btohqsg
I don't know if the wsdegree is a way around this,btohqsg
When did y‚Äôall learn that O levels stand for Ordinary level,btohqsg
Too competitive need something else to distinguish,btohqsg
Singaporeans were very good at following formats,btohqsg
so they adviced schools to switch up learning stules,btohqsg
Yea that's how sgreans are very good at exams,btohqsg
You throw curveball they go crazy,btohqsg
For gp I am banking on,btohqsg
Talking bout bell curve I need to thank the 2021 o levels he‚Äôll curve,btohqsg
Without it  ima be going army soon,btohqsg
Its very hard for me to upgrade a word,btohqsg
cos ksbull shows the top 0.01 of essays,btohqsg
How do y‚Äôall paraphrase the sentence ‚ÄúHe toppled the pile of pizzas into the pond‚Äù,btohqsg
Have you noticed some really short,btohqsg
Do you guys paraphrase it like ‚Äúthe pile of pizzas we‚Äôre toppled by him into the pond‚Äù?,btohqsg
Oh I thought that was para,btohqsg
He knocked over a stack of pizzas into the pond,btohqsg
Well just learnt something new today...explains why I failed English,btohqsg
I heard from my Father the gp is either a hit or miss....but that was when he took it prob 20yrs ago,btohqsg
Like th topic in question can either be really in tune with the current situation like ‚Äúglobal warming‚Äù or rise of inflation....or the go could be like ‚Äúpollination‚Äù and/or rainforest?,btohqsg
Seems to me like its luck what comes out for gp...it can‚Äôt really fck up your overall grading,btohqsg
But I don‚Äôt think it can become the pass/fail you type of exam,btohqsg
Yea my father also did a lot so write out of point because of external factors,btohqsg
Is it safe to say that if you don‚Äôt go Uni  going jc is basically wasting your years?,btohqsg
So what is your next course of action?,btohqsg
I feel like sec schools need to plan learning journeys to jc‚Äôs,btohqsg
I feel jc must have learning journeys to unis,btohqsg
And Unis must have learning journey to Workplaces,btohqsg
So shes forcing you to go poly,btohqsg
It's a part of the testes,btohqsg
you cut the testes in half?,btohqsg
then the pic we measure is,btohqsg
Everyone reading this felt the pain,btohqsg
But it has good personality ok,btohqsg
A 2mm gun hurts the same as a 50 cal sniper,btohqsg
WAIT ITS THE TESTES AH WTF,btohqsg
"they wrote in bold ""YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO KNOW THIS IN ADVANCE""",btohqsg

Just because a guy cooks once doesnt mean hes a chef ya know,btohqsg
If for a guy to be handsome,btohqsg
and a girl to be pretty,btohqsg
one has sharp features and one has soft features,btohqsg
so the kids would would be in the middle,btohqsg
So soft face genes people would have pretty ppl,btohqsg

i think i‚Äôm writing with the wrong hand,btohqsg
what if i was actually right handed but i write with my left hand just because i picked up the pencil with the wrong hand,btohqsg
The reason people write fast is because of the lack of confidence,btohqsg
are you sure it‚Äôs not the lack of time,btohqsg
Lack of time due writing too much. Certain questions require very little answers. So you need to practice more to build confidence to be very specific and not write too much,btohqsg
uhmm how do I say it ah,btohqsg
what if you write too little and miss the point,btohqsg
that one legit need write alot,btohqsg
still need to write fast bro,btohqsg
