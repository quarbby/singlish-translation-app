How is the bank supposed to know what is the correct and wrong amount to deduct?,btohqsg
If the amt merchant quote to you is different from what they instruct the bank to deduct then you have to go settle with the merchant,btohqsg
If is newly card you applied. They will activate you.. I spend last thursday 30 using amex charge card... I call up ask why can't go through for payment . Lucky got my amaze card for payment... customer service say my card not activated.. Friday I try again. It went through 18$ spent at halal restaurant,btohqsg
That means they can deduct any amount sent by the merchant? Also  can’t  they deduct the amount after the client has received from the merchant??,btohqsg
That’s mean the bank just collect the amount happily even though there is an error made by merchant? and the client has to clean up the mess?,btohqsg
If you r from UOB  would v much appreciate if  you can feedback this lapses to your higher authority so that the client would not have gone through the same experience as me🙏,btohqsg
When you hand your debit card to the merchant to make purchase  did you check the amount? Did the merchant give you a invoice or receipt?,btohqsg
That's what I am thinking too. If there's a receipt or invoice then can just show the bank the discrepancies.,btohqsg
I find this detail missing from your description. And No  I am not from UOB,btohqsg
The bank only provide the platform for the merchant to hold and receive the money.It is still up to the client to verify if the amount is correct  and if not  the client has to settle with the merchant to provide refund.,btohqsg
No receipt from the merchant at the point of deduction and the amount  and thought it’s a fraudulent transaction .,btohqsg
Then the bank believe who? If merchant say 100  you say 90. That's why you need to resolve it with merchant. And I'm not from uob,btohqsg
Did you not see the amount before tapping your card to make the transaction?,btohqsg
Are u also from UOB? yes  pls kindly communicate to your higher authority to save the trouble from the client. Thanks.,btohqsg
Didn’t know we have so many people from UOB all of a sudden,btohqsg
LOL just because ppl don't side your story everyone is from uob. Maybe you are the bad experience,btohqsg
Its best to verify the payment amount before authorising the payment. Else its like signing a blank cheque,btohqsg
I think people are trying to explain how the bank works. Your reply isn't helpful. And tbh  someone from uob may not side with UOB. I know many hate their job but no choice. 🥲,btohqsg
Can’t the bank wait for the receipt? So u also  implying the bank can’t make mistake  but the clients do?,btohqsg
Maybe you can apply for a job at the bank to change the policy. If you can't accept the way it works as explained.,btohqsg
Sounds like u basically hand the debit card over without verifying the amount. U know u can always request for a invoice or receipt right?,btohqsg
Yup  but they may be from other banks  just hope that the rights of the client to be protected and also the bank should hold the responsibility and be more willing to help rather than telling the client is the procedure and let them clear the mess.,btohqsg
Doesn’t it work like this - When you make the payment  you have already authorised the transaction? So how can it be the bank or merchant fault if you already make the payment,btohqsg
Sounds like a user skill issue here,btohqsg
No  the amount sent in  is correct but the amt deducted is wrong.,btohqsg
Why would it be the bank's issue if the client approved the transaction? It is a transaction between the client and the merchant. If the amount deviates from the invoice/receipt  and the merchant refuses to refund the difference  report it to the police as fraudulent transaction.,btohqsg
Yes I think you are right  it's the bank fault. You should change bank. Or best is to just pay cash and don't use any bank,btohqsg
U right to see I have authorised but the amt deducted is wrong. So the mistake is by the merchant and not the bank??,btohqsg
Yes you should be disputing the merchant not the bank  the merchant is telling how much to deduct from the bank,btohqsg
Sound so funny.  Probably some hacker hijacked the transaction and changed the amount. 😂,btohqsg
The tricky part is you not keeping the receipt. What if the merchant acts dumb? 🙃,btohqsg
If I use ShopBack but pay using Apple Pay does it considered mobile payment or online,btohqsg
Hi all  thanks  for all the comments and feedback.Think  we will stop the discussion for the benefit of the other users. It’s a good lesson learnt for me and just hope that those who r in the banking sector in the group to look at this lapses seriously and be more innovative in resolving it.?This will definitely protect the interest of the clients🙏,btohqsg
And always ask for receipt or invoice to verify your purchase please!,btohqsg
What if it's client skill issue?,btohqsg
This “lapse” does not seem to be an issue that it’s the bank’s fault,btohqsg

hello does anyone know if i can add my partner's citi rewards points into my krisflyer account?,btohqsg
No. Need to be same name.,btohqsg
HiFor EGA promotion - for how long this 4.6% will last ? Only for one month worth of interest ? And   is there any cap for it can I put any amount?,btohqsg
Hi  i remember watching a video about supercharging the cpf oa. But i couldn’t find the video again. Does anyone have the link?Its has the most updated information after the shielding update?,btohqsg
Supercharging OA in short just means hitting BHS (MA) and FRS (SA). So that any contributions to MA will go straight to OA.,btohqsg
And any interest on the MA & SA will go to the OA immediately right?  And since interest rate is much higher in MA & SA  it will benefit the OA much much more,btohqsg
And another thing. Do we need to keep topping up the MA and SA even after maxing it out? How much is the yearly increase for the FHS?,btohqsg
MA*. SA interest and contributions stay in SA.,btohqsg
You cannot. What do you mean FHS?,btohqsg
If u talking about July-August promo  4.6 is only for July while 3.6 is for August as the additional 1% is for everyday rewards which compare to previous month. Cap is maximum incremental deposit ADB 3 million as per TNC,btohqsg
Ok. Meaning even after the FRS is fulfilled  the interest won’t go into OA?,btohqsg
Typically 3-4%. Unlikely you can do RSTU once you hit FRS since interest is usually higher than limit. But if there's a slight chance the limit increases beyond the interest for that year  then yes.,btohqsg
Yes. Only MA interest will go OA.,btohqsg
