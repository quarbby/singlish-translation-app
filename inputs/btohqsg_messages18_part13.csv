IF i got invited to book a flat but i am overseas  am i able to re-schedule the date?????,btohqsg
no  but u can authorise someone to book on your behalf,btohqsg
what if i am going to overseas with my parents? no way to book,btohqsg
then someone else that is not your parents lor,btohqsg
aunty uncle? grandparents? siblings? close friends? boss?,btohqsg
if u don‚Äôt want to authorise someone  but still want to book  u can book after u come back  BUT it would mean that everyone with q number after u until that day will book before u  so u have less units to choose fromassume 1 day got 10 appts  so count how many days until u return means how many units will be bookedi guess this is ‚Äòrescheduling‚Äô. don‚Äôt have to tell hdb also just come when u come back,btohqsg
Book a flat you can get power of attorney letter to get someone to book on behalf,btohqsg
Don't need POA  just need to fill in authorisation form,btohqsg
You applying alone or with partner?If w partner then ask your partner or their parents.Otherwise authorize someone to book on your behalf. You can fill in all the docs and upload to MyDocs@HDBAuthorisation form:https://www20.hdb.gov.sg/bp13/bp13005p.nsf/Authorisation%20Form%20(OBF)?OpenPage,btohqsg

You can reschedule  but just note that you might miss the unit you will like as the people who have queue number after you  will still be choosing unit as per usual and they might or might not choose your unit..,btohqsg

Hi all  anyone applying for pMeadow/pVerge?HDB portal under applications stated that flat selection will be in Nov but I have received sms for flat booking in September.But when checking HDB portal  my invitation package is not ready to view yet.Anyone else received the invitation as well?,btohqsg
probably for another project you applied for previously. did you also apply for any of these?,btohqsg
did you applied for sbf & got a ballot number?,btohqsg
i assume you referring to Parc Meadow/Plantation Verge?maybe can follow this link >https://t.me/tengahmay2023bto,btohqsg
pMEADOW is have the better location even a bit far from MRT compare to pVERGE,btohqsg
For BTO  I remember we have to login to check remaining units.SBF have should be also after getting the number.Open Booking should able to check once it releases the units once announced,btohqsg
gWaterfront I & II just complete in August....Omg Brickland Weave still not yet selection....,btohqsg
Ahh.... okay.   Hope can see the model at the common area soon,btohqsg
Thank you for replying. Yes  apparently my previous far off Q number for gWaterfront(1000+) actually went through and i'm invited to choose unit. But the remaining units are not attractive at all.I somehow managed to get Q number for pMeadow(100+) as well and now I am keener for pMeadow as my queue number is way better. Not sure if this will affect my application for pMeadow.,btohqsg
Thank you for replying! Yes definitely aiming for pMeadow now. gWaterfront is good if have good unit cuz of the man made lake. But I see the remaining units no good left level 3 and 2. Now just unsure if my application for pMeadow will be affected.,btohqsg
When I were at HDB during number 800 they only can get below L4 next day 900+ is pm below L3 left(poor indian family only have choice of facing ESS or Drop off....best view is L2 above CCC overseeing common green,btohqsg
If 100+ for pMEADOW is very good number should be able to get above L10 depends to which block....,btohqsg

Hi all need some advise here. I got my HFE. Its lower thn expected. However  3 months ago i got promoted so there is a change in my income. How many months after i should apply HFE again so that the loan amount will be provided based on my latest income and not my previous income,btohqsg
doesn't matter. for the actual loan amount  your income will be assessed again closer to key collection. for now  the figure shown is just an indication,btohqsg
Meaning  loan amount in HFE could still change  unlike the situation for HLE?I was told that  income will be assessed again when nearing key collection for HLEIf income is the same or higher than during the initial HLE application  loan amount remains the sameIf income becomes lower  loan amount will be reviewed and likely lowered,btohqsg
for hle  if ur income is higher  loan amount will increase. if same  it will stay same  and if lower  it will decrease,btohqsg
Is there a source for this or based on your experience?I was told that loan amount will be the same and HLE auto renewed as long as income is not lower than at the point of bto application or prior to flat selection,btohqsg
based on the multiple hdb officers i‚Äôve spoken to,btohqsg
