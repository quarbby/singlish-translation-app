Question:Has anyone received HFE with an amount that is totally different from the HDB calculator?OrAnybody provided employment contracts instead of payslips during HFE application?,btohqsg
Anyone receive this email? Does it mean that we can participate in Feb BTO?Does it mean to apply for Feb BTO  means give up current BTO slot?,btohqsg
Your queue num is within supply? Eg 499/500? From my understanding you cannot ballot for other launches if you have an existing number that‚Äôs within supply. It‚Äôd be blocked from the frontend when you try to apply for feb,btohqsg
Is the Dec 2023 ballot result out?,btohqsg
"I believe you / your partner asked in Queenstown group also  but anyway yes HDB is saying they will ""exercise flexibility"" for you to apply for Feb 2024",btohqsg
Otherwise usually within supply you're not allowed to apply for another until you pass your selection appt for Queenstown,btohqsg
Hello how much should our combined income ceiling be for 550k Loan?,btohqsg
I hope can correct me on this Our HDB BTO is valued at 698kWe paid $2k option fee and $$49k+ for the 5% staggered downpayment and other fees applicable.So the remaining 15% would be around $105k?As we will be taking HDB loan  we want to ensure if our income ceiling can meet the LTV which is about 550k,btohqsg
The incoming ceiling is based on at point of application  of bto,btohqsg
If u really required confirmation u get it from hdb not just from some bto chat,btohqsg
Your HFE should have stated the loan amount you are eligible,btohqsg
So our HFE will be assessed next on the time before key collection,btohqsg
I see‚Ä¶ then best to write into HDB,btohqsg
If i understand your question correctly  you're trying to figure out themintotal monthly income to be able to get a loan of 550k. That should be roughly $8.7k/mth combined income.You can try playing around with the parameters here to see the loan amount you're eligible forhttps://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/calculator/budget,btohqsg
Hello pls don't post any unrelated to BTO stuffs here,btohqsg

For those who are doing aircon  pls avoid USIN aircon at all cost  you‚Äôll regret.. Many neighbours in my estate including my family facing issues after 1 year aircon installation. And they pushed the blame back to my/my neighbours usage.We feel its likely due to poor workmanship or inferior materials used since many people are affected by it,btohqsg
I‚Äôm using ah cheng handyman serviceThey fix leakage service is goodReasonable price,btohqsg
And also do digital locks sales and installation,btohqsg
anyone know ah if ur appt is for example 10.30am if you go earlier will u be served earlier or die die 10.30am?,btohqsg
If you're asking about selection appt  the time that you actually get served is kind of dependent on the queue numbers in your project before you. I'm personally not sure whether it can be earlier than the stated time  but Ive heard that it can be later (because people before you take longer to select their flat and etc),btohqsg
its SBF. project already completed so not sure its just flat selection only or taking key on the same day also,btohqsg
Ohh I see. Not too sure about this. If anyone can advise  pls do! Else you can try asking in the SBF group chat,btohqsg
Mine was served a few min after the appt time. But I heard from the Q number way before me one says his one is like 8 min before the appt time.,btohqsg
so reach earlier and take queue number earlier = pointless/useless?,btohqsg
fck sia. i got hosp appt that day...at 11.15. if reschedule it will be 6 months later sia,btohqsg
but is that day just flat selection or key collection also i wonder,btohqsg
Evening  just curious. My bto PCD is 4Q2025. My EDPD is 4Q2027..What does it mean?  I‚Äôm getting the keys anytime within the 2 years?,btohqsg
Hi you can authorize someone to select on your behalf.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/doc/EAPG-CSC/Authorisation-To-Select-a-Flat.ashx,btohqsg
Flat selection either 1 owner can come down dunid both2,btohqsg
Hi  i was offered a chance to choose a unit for my february BTO  but im not fond of any units. Do i still have to come down to HDB for my flat-selection appointment to reject it? and if i reject  will it affect my application for my next bto?,btohqsg
1. No you don't need to go down to reject it; a no-show is also taken as rejection2. Assuming you mean Feb 2022 bto  + this is your 1st time rejecting - in which case  no  it will not affect your next application. But any applications you make henceforth will be subject to the rule that any rejection will result in 2nd timer status for 1 year (this rule started in Oct 2022 bto onwards),btohqsg
feb sbf  anyone knws what date is it?,btohqsg
