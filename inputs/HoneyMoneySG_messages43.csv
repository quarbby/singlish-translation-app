There's nothing to stop you from starting a new bonus interest cycle after the 4th month. Most would likely start a new cycle on the 5th or 6th months. The bonus interest varies every month  but there is a slight downtrend in recent months  matching the general interest rate trends.,btohqsg

3 Simple Mother's Day Ideas: Dine Out   Spa and Earn 5% cashback*!URL:https://secure.fundsupermart.com/fsm/article/view/rcms270806Hi  anyone has experience with the FX spread for FSMone debit card? Card is issued by Nium (which also issues the Amaze card). There is current promotion for 5% cashback on local and overseas dining and spa  which I may consider to use for upcoming trip. But cashback promo is limited to first 200 customers and capped at $40.,btohqsg
If you have Amaze card  you could use Amaze card linked to Citibank Cashback Master.Get 1% Amaze cashback + 6% Citibank cashback. No need to worry about first XX customers.,btohqsg
Nium is the issuer for both Amaze and FSMone debit card. I haven't used the latter  but I would expect similar about 2.5% markup from Interbank FX rates.,btohqsg
Thanks for the suggestion. The thing with Amaze is that 2000 pts need to be accumulated before withdrawal. And the pts have expiry.,btohqsg
what my household typically does is treat the 1% Amaze cashback as a bonus. Only go for the linked credit card benefit as the definite.,btohqsg
For cashback card  again there‚Äôs a min spend of $800,btohqsg

Hi topic up for debate:Is it better to top up cpf SA or top up srs and from there buy retireready single premium from manulife (IRR for retireready is projected non guaranteed 2.6%-3.7%) thanks!,btohqsg
CPF SA will guarantee 4% p.a. but you cannot withdraw funds until 55. SRS you can withdraw before 55 at a 5% penalty + taxable income,btohqsg
Do I wait until I get an sms from them then transfer money in and do 5 FAST transfer?,btohqsg
i would have thought the first topic should be... should a person buy Manulife Single Premium policy..,btohqsg
The min amt for single premium is $25k. Srs can be topped up over 2yrs to save up this amt to convert to Retireready single premium. Whereas cpf SA can also be topped up over 3+yrs to reach this amt while generating 4%,btohqsg
Personally (assuming all other finances are taken care of)  would be to top up SA to earn that stable 4% without incurring any additional fees  which is already higher than the non projected rate. For SRS  you will incur transaction/commission fees on top of fund fees,btohqsg
Hey folks  can I ask whether anyone here has personal experience using Trust Bank Card in Japan? Aware that no fees charged by Trust Bank. I wish to know how much fees are charged by the 'ATM provider' üòäI used YouTrip card at 7 Eleven ATM in 2019. I remembered there was a S$5 charge per use.Thanks!,btohqsg
Key word - ‚Äú non guaranteed ‚Äú,btohqsg
The experience of ATM withdrawal overseas is touch and go in my opinion.Even Revolut always says there is no cash withdrawal fee if you withdraw at one of the ATMs listed in their app. I personally kept trying to find a supported ATM based on their map app in-app and could never find one in Japan that is near enough to me even though I was staring at a 7/11 ATM in my face.Basically I won't try it unless I'm desperate for cash while in Japan. Don't plan it such that you 'have to' withdraw cash in Japan. They are actually very card friendly except for street food and the smaller restaurants who only accept cash.,btohqsg
Thanks  Mt for your suggestion. Fully agree. Card remains the priority mode for spending. However  rural places (such as a ramen store in a street in Hokkaido) may have challenges accepting cards.Hope to hear from the folks with personal experience :),btohqsg
It‚Äôs w different thing.The 5 in 5 out is for 1% extraThis sms is for the 5.5% interest,btohqsg
I believe the fee imposed by ATM bank varies from bank to bank. Likewise the withdrawal limit applying to overseas issued cards when using ATM in Japan. I did that last year in Tokyo using YouTrip. found that fee from banks and limit differ. YouTrip will charge SGD5 equivalent from your JPY wallet. So I'll always withdraw the maximum allowed by the ATM,btohqsg
do they state the maximum allowed by the ATM before you press PROCEED?,btohqsg
As in u can just send the 5 in 5 out if u want to use it for the 1% Cashback for your credit cards,btohqsg
Thanks!! Exerpt from YouTrip FAQ. Unclear whether $5 is charged by ATM or YouTrip though.Any folks have withdrawn ¬• in Japan using Revolut or Trust Bank  can share ?,btohqsg
is it worth paying education fees/condo rental with citi payall? and which is the best card to do so?,btohqsg
Yes. The one I tried in a 7 Eleven had 2x withdrawal limit compared to a ATM in a big local Japanese bank branch. so I suggest you try those in conbini first,btohqsg
5 bucks is definitely earned by YouTrip. Japan ATM is probably less than 200 Yen or even 150. Can't remember,btohqsg
i wanted to test a 7/11 ATM using revolut but it wasn't identified in the Revolut App to be a fee free ATM.. so i chickened out and didn't do it. Afterall I didn't need the cash  just want to 'know for fun;.,btohqsg

There was supposed to be a revamp of the Cashback but i think it got indefinitely postponed.. Maybe DBS found out about potential MS so they killed it?,btohqsg
would just like to add.. if you are used to this sort of spending pattern:1. Half on Online Spend2. Half on Mobile Wallet Spend (e.g. ApplePay)actually UOB Evol is a better card than DBS Live Fresh. Just watch out for UOB$ merchants which are excluded spend.$300+$300 for $40 cashback per month = 6.67% cashback.,btohqsg

anyway u can tax refund to any card  no need to be the card used for the transactions. Collected knowledge here suggest refunding to revolut in the local currency  this allows converting to sgd using revolut rates and can transfer out to bank.,btohqsg

always charge to the local currency of the foreign country.,btohqsg

I had 2 different experiences with global blue recently. Both paid with Amaze linked to credit card.one forcefully converted my EUR tax refund into SGD and refunded my linked credit card in SGD even though I specified Revolut to receive the tax refundone credited my EUR into my specified card in Global Blue app which was Revolut in EURIf you want to play safe  especially big amounts which normal credit card will burst the reward cap  just use Revolut to pay and receive refund.,btohqsg
how exactly they forcefully refund to the linked credit card?,btohqsg
meaning i specified to Global Blue to send the Tax Refund to my Revolut card (I provided my Revolut card details).say the tax refund expected is EUR100. End up  I got EUR100 converted into SGD and sent to my current linked mastercard with Amaze.,btohqsg
My GUESS is if the merchant provides your credit card details to Global Blue  Global Blue will refund to the original card  regardless of your preference.If the merchant withholds your credit card details (e.g. said you paid in cash or what)  then Global Blue will refund to the card of your choice specified in Global Blue app.GUESSING ONLY. NOT ENOUGH DP TO CONCLUDE.,btohqsg
Do u get 5% on telco payments?,btohqsg
You have to read the TNC for exclusions.https://www.dbs.com.sg/iwov-resources/media/pdf/cards/live-fresh-cashback-tnc.pdfThe term I never liked is Utility since telephone bills can be loosely deemed to be Utilities too.And from what I understand there is always some confusion/inconsistency over whether a recurring bill is treated as online or not.To be safe for my household:1. all telco bills go to Maybank Family and Friends (confirmed 8% cashback).2. all SP Power bills go to UOB One (confirmed 4.33% cashback).,btohqsg
My Tax Refund using Amaze card recently from Sweden via global Blue (GB) - no option for me to choose currency to received.GB just refund me in SGD (show in their portal/app - conversion from GB not from Amaze).i had switch to wallet to receive tax refund (not sure will deduct mile/cash rebate if tax refund direct into link card),btohqsg
yes if paid via telco website/app and payment mode coded as online,btohqsg
So for HSBC EGA  must wait for their sms to say you are in the program?,btohqsg
no consistently received. Sometimes you qualified but no SMS received.i did hear of a horror story someone sms in  got the acknowledgement but end up HSBC say some error he is not qualified (THIS STORY IS UNVERIFIED THOUGH),btohqsg
Weird leh cuz I paid via website for zero1 using amaze>crmc no 10x leh,btohqsg
yeah  its erratic  until i also lost count which month am i in,btohqsg
was this your first payment or was it the recurring bill that didn't earn you 10x?,btohqsg
Was the first sign up payment,btohqsg
actually can u also educate me ah.. for this sort of telco payments / recurring payments... how are you able to use Amaze + linked card?do u have to keep your linked card set at a certain period of the month  ready for Zero1 to do the recurring deduction?,btohqsg
Yup! But for me  I primarily only connect crmc so not an issue. My only problem is this zero1 mcc  cuz I do get 10x for giga,btohqsg
pretty sure it is not the MCC issue because Maybank Family and Friends also go by MCC for the 8% cashback and I have no issue with Zero1 initial payment or monthly recurring payments getting 8%.,btohqsg
Maybe zero1 is exactly the case I was referring to whereby details entered into the online portal does not necessarily translate to it being processed as an online transaction? Although I thought any transaction processed by Amaze is treated as online?,btohqsg
Yea exactly  so it shouldn't be excluded unless it's considered travel  which is highly unlikely. Maybe I'll chat and check with citi,btohqsg

Hey@ChrisHMSG  I used the referral link you have provided here for my HSBC Card. I just contacted HSBC and found out that I will only be eligible for the Singsaver $30 and not the existing HSBC Offer (Samsonite or $150 Cashback).....Could you please double confirm what was your arrangement with Singsaver? If the promotion is different please be honest about it to your members....,btohqsg
from the referenced post:- EXISTING Customers: Get $50 Cashback+additional $30 from using the linkare you saying you are a new-to-bank customer?,btohqsg
Yes I am a new to HSBC Customer. From the post  I should be getting $30 Cash + HSBC Rewards.,btohqsg
ah yes  misunderstood your posti would assume new customers would get both too,btohqsg
The offer message is correct with $150 (HSBC) + $30 (Singsaver) as communicated by Singsaver. Do direct your queries toinfo@singsaver.com.sgas they are the main coordinatorsI'm not sure who you contacted from HSBC team. But it is possible that the CS and Marketing are not aligned with each other,btohqsg
Thanks for responding Chris üòÑ appreciate it. I spoke to the HSBC customer support. Alright I will contact singsaver directly.,btohqsg

Hi I used DBS women world card to make purchase on Japan website. Per DBS apps  I see an unbilled amount pertaining to the overseas purchase in SGD reflecting in the credit card section. May I know if this unbilled amount is already inclusive of transaction fee  or whether the transaction fee will only be reflected in actual bill?,btohqsg
The payment was made in JPY. After a few days  the JPY amount has reflected as SGD.,btohqsg
i have fund the amount but have not see any reward. is it the reward will only be available after 30 days? thanks,btohqsg
(9 + 10)@DxCollections  please  send the solution to the arithmetic operation provided within the time amount specified to this group  otherwise you will be kicked. Thank you! (60 sec)Powered by1inch Network,btohqsg
Btw I made it a point not to apply to Singsaver promos  as I have a feeling that they are trying to weasel out giving the gift. If you want the gift  better track it and follow up closely  else they might just pocket it.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing this! I think ill nvr apply to Singsaver anymore,btohqsg
I cancelled HSBC revolution card last year and somehow I can't open EGA account now.. I can't login to the app üò©,btohqsg
As long as you are/were a HSBC credit card holder in the past  you are likely not able to open HSBC EGA online.It is due to some system issue whereby HSBC system detects missing information (we used to speculate it is due to missing AML detail).You will need to go down to branch to open HSBC EGA in such cases.,btohqsg
For Citi Rewards Card sign up promotion  may I ask if the 40 000 Citi ThankYou Points (16 000 Citi Miles) Welcome Gift from Citibank can stack on top of the $300 Cash via PayNow from SingSaver?

Hi. Anyone using the DBS Live Fresh credit card? I need some help on the cashback calculation,btohqsg
You can refer to this guide for information.Source:https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/cards/credit-cards/live-fresh-dbs-visa-paywave-platinum-card,btohqsg
I think there‚Äôs a calculator on the website,btohqsg
Do note the computation is based on date of posting of transactions charged to the card and not the date of charge.,btohqsg
Useless. Because i doing my own calculations and i got very close to the cashback i was given. But it seems that there is something that i had missed. I always have the 0.3% cashback but all my transactions were either contactless or online. So i am unsure what was excluded.,btohqsg
Really? When i called DBS bank they said was transaction date and not posting date.,btohqsg
I could be wrong ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Most cards are based on date of posting for rewards computation.,btohqsg
I will try counting based on posting date and see if I can get the result. Thanks!,btohqsg
check whats the best credit card to use for airbnb?üëÄ,btohqsg
yes dbs is by transaction date,btohqsg
For me  the full cash rebates come in at the next statement month. Not sure that's helpful info for you.As long as I get the bonus cashbacks (ie > 0.3%)  I didn't verify the amount of cashbacks paid by dbs is correct by doing calculations on my own. Personally  I don't think is worth the effort.,btohqsg
Alright. Because i want to know what is not included in the 5%. Like i just found out i shouldn‚Äôt be paying my phone bill using DBS Live Fresh card coz there is no benefit.,btohqsg
I learned the same from this community (thankful). Personally  using multiple cards to earn max cash rebates and air miles is administratively challenging for me.The risk of missed payments and bank not giving late payment waivers increases when we have more cards.Suggests folks here to consider risks vs rewards and make an informed decision when maintaining credit cards (after obtaining the sign up freebies).,btohqsg
i only have this card that require me to think and i want to maxmise everything. i don't find it challenging because i track every single transaction everyday for the past few years. It had became a habit and once I know how the card works I will remember it and everything will be business as usual.,btohqsg
why is there no benefit to paying phone bill by DBS Live Fresh?we were just on this topic yesterday,btohqsg
It doesn't give me cashback. So I will use my UOB One card to pay to hit the min $500 a month since my UOB One card is tied to my UOB One account.,btohqsg
oh ok what telco did you try?I was the one who said I didn't like using DBS Live Fresh to pay telcos because I wasn't sure if it could be excluded due to 'utilities'.,btohqsg
This is also one of the two cards I go to for cash rebates :). The other is CRMC.,btohqsg
Giga and Singtel. I spoke to DBS yesterday and this is what they told me.,btohqsg
Just to add on with my personal experience.When I need to meet the $600 spend limit  I manually charged my M1 and Starhub to the card. So far  I manage to get the bonus cashback.,btohqsg
Very lost  seems like there‚Äôs alot of good credit cards  so what is the heuristics of picking the ideal card for myself?,btohqsg
like picking the right spouse.. MANY CONSIDERATIONS!,btohqsg
My M1 and starhub bills are charged to UOB One card by default :),btohqsg
I can hit the $600 without my telco bills so I going to use it for my UOB One. I also use atome if possible so when months i cannot hit $600 i will pay my atome bill off,btohqsg
why no love for Maybank telco category 8%?,btohqsg
Personally  I apply the risks vs rewards method to select cards in consideration of administrative overheads.That's why I do not sign up cards for the sake of sign up freebies unless the freebies are really attractive!,btohqsg
so strange  should get bonus cashback for online if u paid monthly via singtel website/app. For Giga heard that it is online even if recurring bill payment via Giga app.,btohqsg
nope. it counts towards your $600 min but doesn't give you cashback,btohqsg
I do get get my bonus cashback for singtel when I paid via singtel app,btohqsg
Just to confirm - did u observe over a period of two statement months to confirm that there is no cashback?,btohqsg

based on my calculation over two months yes there is no cashback. on top of that i spoke to DBS yesterday and they told me so.,btohqsg
did u check the mcc and payment mode via dbs ibanking chatbot?,btohqsg
like i said. i spoke to the DBS spokeperson and confirmed based on the transaction i made.,btohqsg
hi  if you dont mind sharing  did the DBS CSA share what is the MCC for giga?,btohqsg
Got it =) DBS does not control the MCC of the merchant(such as Giga). The MCC is matter between the merchant and the card company. Knowing the MCC helps us understand the 'why' but it doesn't change the prospect of cashback.,btohqsg
i had called DBS again to request for a breakdown. i just want to understand a little bit more. i want to maximise but i am not very particular about that few cents difference,btohqsg
so based on my calculation I am within plus minus 30cents  which in my opinion good enough. but i just want to know more,btohqsg
let me get back to you on this coz i am waiting for them to call me back with the breakdown,btohqsg
anyway I just want to thanks those who helped. appreciated!,btohqsg
Giga will earn 10x for crmc paired with amaze tried and tested,btohqsg
I guess can't use dbs live fresh to pay for zero1 to get the 5% then ):,btohqsg
The more you call for details  the more they investigate n found out  then more nerfs will be announced in the future. üòÇ,btohqsg
breakdown including the MCC and payment mode? If not easier that u can chat these via ibanking chatbot. If online and mcc is telco  no reason that u not getting the 5%.,btohqsg
yeah actually i support this..should not call banks to ask.. just try to reconcile manually or ask in chats...if unsure  just avoid. Don't go and ask for black and white or ask they investigate this and that.,btohqsg
A lot of Nerf announced past few months were the results of people calling banks to investigate for rewards/cashback  ask for details‚Ä¶.  etc‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Just present and pay using card can Liao Ah? That time other kfc promo  the cashier ask me order from app. Very troublesome,btohqsg
Call into Bank...I read your TNC say buy voucher cannot qualify  but I hear from Internet People that they buy voucher and can qualify  can you check and confirm for me please?,btohqsg
I support that  too. I design my questions to check on transaction around their terms and conditions. Included/Excluded. If excluded  why it is excluded?I personally won't dive into details like asking for MCC code of a merchant because that won't change the outcome.,btohqsg
oh i am the other way leh.. i only ask for MCC code from UOB chat service when I'm unsure.I won't ask them to clarify anything about their TNC...,btohqsg
If you want MCC‚Ä¶ remember Max? üòªüòçHeymax.ai,btohqsg
I see :) I prefer to call. I'm not clarifying their TnC. I'm checking on my transaction. From data point angle  it would be under a generic category 'check transaction'.Thankful I learn from this community that there are chat bots and AI tools.,btohqsg
I call and check my transaction. I don‚Äôt question the cashback and I don‚Äôt dispute it. What is given to me is given. I just want to understand. If they are gonna nerf  they will nerf it eventually without you doing a single thing. So I don‚Äôt get why you shouldn‚Äôt call to understand more about your transactions.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt ask why certain thing is include while others doesn‚Äôt. I just want to know based on my spending what was excluded. That‚Äôs all.,btohqsg
because when u call in to check on your transactions  the bank may discover a transaction that should not qualify for rewards  actually are qualifying now due to system error.,btohqsg
I am sure if I don‚Äôt do it  someone else will. Like i said  if they want to nerf it  they will nerf it eventually. They are bank. They ain‚Äôt stupid.,btohqsg
That's also the posture I take. The intent is for my call to be classified as 'checking transaction'.Customers are fully entitled to checking their transactions. This is also a MAS requirement to include good and easy to use service to aid customers to check on their transactions.Calling the bank vs self check channel  do not make fundamental difference as long as the Ask from customer is related to 'checking of transaction'.,btohqsg
Yes! I am checking to understand my spending better. So I can make the best decision on which card to use for which merchant. Honestly cashback is just something extra. Even if certain things is being excluded doesn‚Äôt affect my spending.,btohqsg
Yeah giga abit weird. Pay thru app or apple pay also dont count into the card‚Äôs cashback/reward. Last time when i used SC Spree also same thing.,btohqsg
What? So I don't get 4mpd on my HSBC Revo even if it's google pay?,btohqsg
What you asking?Anyway if you asking abt paying utilities/telco with HSBC revo  defo no 4MPD irregardless if you go through Google pay  it‚Äôs not on the whitelist for 10x points bro,btohqsg
Yeah. Only get the base rewards of the card you hold.,btohqsg
i think someone mentioned above CRMC+Amaze can,btohqsg
just looked thru UOB ONE and EVOL T&C...seems like it doesnt exclude giga MCC also,btohqsg
Not sure if the following website will help you or not.https://heymax.ai/v2/search/Giga%20telco?useVisaApi=false&country=all,btohqsg
hm  Giga can pay using contactless?,btohqsg
i see giga accepts amex now so maybe amex tcb can be a alternative also,btohqsg
1.7% is UOB absolute...but yeah shd be can,btohqsg
no what i meant is why only aim 1.7% rewards for paying telcos?,btohqsg
i mean...to each his own. I'm just curious what cards dont exclude and therefore can earn more than just the base rate,btohqsg
It is so useful I wished they let members choose more than 5 categories! haha,btohqsg

Insurance is not an exception even for DBS Altitude Amex cardsFrom the article:What transactions aren‚Äôt eligible for DBS Points?A full list of transactions that do not earn DBS Points can be found in theT&C.I‚Äôve highlighted a few noteworthy categories below:‚Ä¢ Education‚Ä¢ Government Institutions‚Ä¢ Insurance‚Ä¢ Non-Profits‚Ä¢ Hospitals‚Ä¢ Utilities‚Ä¢ Gambling‚Ä¢ Top-ups of prepaid accounts (e.g. Grab  YouTrip),btohqsg

FYI I get 5% for paying SingTel bill thr apps and online both get 5% every month.,btohqsg
It is good if you want to park emergency fund into something safe and liquid. SSB is guaranteed by SG govt and can be redeemed and get back your fund by the 2nd business day of the following month.,btohqsg
I took a look at Maybank FD bundle promotion. Seems like there's a catch. We need to deposit an amount into a Savings account first  then we can only deposit up to certain amount in FD to have 3.9% for 12 months,btohqsg

i read before for Maybank FD bundle the EIR is around 3.65%,btohqsg
Funds deposited into the CASA Account (‚ÄúDeposit Amount‚Äù) will be held by the bank for the same periodas the Time Deposit from the date of deposit is made and will not be available for withdrawal duringthis period of time (‚ÄúEarmark Period‚Äù).

U can check out milelions article on hospital bills as alot of bank cc exclude hospital bill for rebate in term or cashback or miles,btohqsg
If your bill is 9k  it would work best with a low cashback card with no limited like uob absolute 1.7  amex tcb 1.5 (if pay at hospital kiosk)  maybe citibank cash back plus (1.6) on healthhub app if you are looking at 9k bills. It will work out to be more cashback then hsbc as there is no cap,btohqsg
And if payment through app is consider as online you can look at citi smrt card however u have to ask other if healthhub app is consider online or not,btohqsg
Can we split bill using health hub app?,btohqsg

Hello all. I have the standard chartered and ocbc bank account. is it worth it to transfer back and forth every month to get higher interest? How does it work?,btohqsg
How do I earn passive income with 50k?,btohqsg
What‚Äôs that and how does it work? How much can I earn?,btohqsg
https://www.mas.gov.sg/bonds-and-bills/singapore-savings-bondsAbout 2.5% to 3% p.a. Depending on which ones you buy. Have a read of the link.,btohqsg
But 3% pa is lower than what UOB is offering,btohqsg
You get about 3.8% from UOB One account,btohqsg
The answer to your question depends on your investment objectives for Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB)  the investment horizon (e.g how long u can afford not to touch the investment pot) and your tolerance for paper loss (e.g 30% mark-to-market paper for 12 months).Paper loss (mark-to-market loss) is not actual money loss unless the investor sell to close the position.,btohqsg
UOB One account has conditions you need to fulfil. That is not passive income.Passive income means you buy once then don't need to bother managing anymore.Also  UOB One account the interest rate can change.SSB once you buy the rate is fixed for 10 years. And you have the option to sell back to government at 100% anytime u want with 1 month redemption delay.,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm going to spend money anyways  so isn‚Äôt UOB One better?,btohqsg
I agree that it‚Äôll change overtime but for now since it‚Äôs still giving high interest  wouldn‚Äôt that be better to just take as much as you can first?,btohqsg
SSB is a specially curated Bond product. It is curated by MAS but still behave like a bond with added ingredients of easy access and ease of withdrawal.UOB One account is not a bond. It is a higher interest savings account (product). Not  apple to apple product comparison üòÅ,btohqsg
That‚Äôs true. Thanks for the tips,btohqsg
UOB One is way better if you have the time to manage it (meet all the conditions).UOB One should form part of your Cash Management portfolio (which means you need effort to manage).SSB on the other hand should form part of your Passive Income portfolio (buy and forget investments).You can do BOTH at once.,btohqsg
Ya. I‚Äôm consistently managing it. I can do both if I have the capital,btohqsg
I beg to differ in the management effort for Uob One. It is designed to deepen the 'relationship' and 'engagement' of customers who CHOOSE UOB as their primary bank (sal credit  giro  savings  credit card).Personally  I think no point force feed to meet requirements for higher interest.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not forcing if your monthly spent hits the minimum requirement,btohqsg
Other than UOB One which bank saving account can get higher interest but with lesser conditions?,btohqsg

the paynow is not subjected to 1% rebate.but it enrols u into the program,btohqsg
yes i second this.Home loans NOW currently has no easy obvious strategy due to the irreversible (high penalties) cost of refinancing one now. You cannot just amend it easily a few months down the road  you need to wait for lockin to end.Even the used to be easy to answer question of Fixed vs Floating packages  is not easy to answer now.,btohqsg

Hi guys What's the best card to earn 4mpd when doing grocery at Fair Price?1. Instarem Amaze + Citi Rewards2. HSBC revolution via Google PayThese 2 methods are ok?,btohqsg
"wait  so what did you mean by your initial message: ""6300 mcc normally so excluded everywhere except DBS Amex cards incl Altitude Amex""",btohqsg
6 miles per dollar.... i think there are a few good categories. If I were to select I would choose Fashion and Travel,btohqsg
Both methods work. If you have the fairprice app  you can add citi rewards (without instarem) & HSBC revo as payment methods  will also earn 4mpd  and earn link points too. Tapping HSBC Revo as paywave at the card terminal also can - no need google pay actually,btohqsg
I think it equates to 2.64% cashback at 6mpd = 15xUNI per $5 spend = 1 136UNI$ to $10 cash rebate$1000 spend = 3 000 UNI$ = $26.40 cashback = 2.64%of course this is the bare minimum reward level  if you convert into air tickets  it will be worth more.,btohqsg

Not too sure if this will help but I'm personally considering msig,btohqsg
Any particular reason out of so many other providers?Just trying to find smth as cheap as possible  didn't have much to consider since I have other insurance plans already. But definitely don't mind paying slightly more for a good and useful plan.,btohqsg
I think I was looking mainly at bigger brands then just feel the coverage for the amount there suits me bah..main concern is on reputation so in case something happens  won't (hopefully) be problematic in claims.That said I never really looked extensively everywhere la  so DYOR tooüòÖ,btohqsg
In my opinion  travel insurance plans are so opaque it is very difficult to compare which insurer has a more beneficial plan compared to another. My recommendation is to focus narrowly on a few commonly claimed features that you think you really need  and do a like for like comparison between 2 to 3 insurers  then just choose the cheapest.,btohqsg
MSIG is definitely a premium insurer  it is more expensive.,btohqsg
Thanks William   appreciate it and will reconsider,btohqsg
When I buy insurance plans  I look at ease of claiming.  The coverage is quite similar with each tier.  I‚Äôve never had any issue with Allianz all fully claimed within 30 days with supporting documentation  legit reasons.  Then I itchy backside went to MSIG and 6 months later they still lost in translation  they have all my documentation  calling the hotline is a waste of my time.

Your CPF transactions in your CPF account(s) affect the amount of interest u would receive.Money CREDITS into your CPF accounts (e.g contributions  refund and court settlement) this month start earning interest from the next month onwards.Money DEBITS from your CPF accounts (e.g withdrawal  deductions and court settlement) in a month will loose the entire month's interest on the month of withdrawal. For instance  if party A transferred $200 000 of CPF SA to Party B on 30 Apr as part of a court proceeding settlement. Party A would loose the entire month (Apr) interest for the $200 000 (666.67 $).Personally  I do RTSU (via cash) to my parents on the last day of the month so that my money can earn some interest in my own bank account.I do not qualify for cpf withdrawal yet.Source:https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/growing-your-savings/cpf-interest-rates/how-is-my-cpf-interest-computed-and-credited-into-my-accounts,btohqsg

I have all the 3 cards you mention  personally I think I would prefer to use Revolut or Trust  since for Youtrip you can't withdraw the money out.For Trust they have some stamp reward system  so even on overseas spend if you hit the requirement you can get the stamps.For Revolut there is no such things  so if you want rewards  you can consider Trust. For FX rates wise sometimes Revolut is better  sometimes Trust is better. Just take note that on weekends Revolut has a 1% charge.,btohqsg

Whether a merchant has a PayWave machine  is it confirm that when you tap it with Google Pay  the transaction will qualify as Mobile Contactless  or is there different kind of machine that may not earn cashback on PayWave with Google Pay?2. Whether all SG QR(Not Nets QR or PayNow QR) are made the same. i.e the moment I see SG QR  paying by scanning the QR code using XNAP will qualify as online spend?,btohqsg
Cardmembers who have been awarded the S$100 or S$50 quarterly cashback will get an additional 5% cashback and cardmembers who have been awarded $200 quarterly cashback will get an additional 6.67% cashback on the total Dairy Farm Singapore such as Cold Storage  CS Fresh Giant  Guardian  7-Eleven  Marketplace  Jasons  Jasons Deli  Grab (excludes mobile wallet top-ups)  Shopee Singapore transactions (excludes ShopeePay)  SimplyGoNEW (bus and train rides) and UOB Travel (excludes online and flight only bookings) and additional 1.67% cashback on Shell transactions successfully charged and posted to the Card Account in each statement month. All Cardmembers who have been awarded the quarterly cashback will get an additional 1% cashback on Singapore Power utilities bill (excluding payments via AXS) successfully charged and posted to the Card Account in each statement month. Additional cashback will be capped at S$100 per month.I see this so it is all grab stuff except topups.,btohqsg
Just sharing similar fraudulent transactions on my WWMC recently as well. Happened to be checking once every few days and called DBS immediately the next day. They blocked the card and will replace it while reimbursing these 2 transactions  all rewards points are not affected.,btohqsg
Take note Minimum $500 spend on Evol is for UOB one account bonus. If you want Evol cashback  minimum spend amount is $600.,btohqsg
hi anyone know if can use citi pay all to pay for tax in installments? how do you go about doing it?,btohqsg
Think it's across all cards. I had that issue on Citi Premiermiles recently with several other reports from others. Idk why can't banks allow us to set to do 2fa for all transactions by default  if no 2fa  it will be declined and we have to use iBanking/app to whitelist it manually then reattempt the purchase.,btohqsg
I wish it was like this as well. Recently MatchMove has been testing a feature like that with their prepaid cards,btohqsg
The funny thing is they'll probably spend less time and resources dealing with the fraudulent transactions by doing so.,btohqsg
Thank you. I guess as long as it posts at Grab* (excluding topups) it counts :),btohqsg
Yup. I checked that out :) I hope SP utilities payment on the SP app counts as online for EVOL?,btohqsg
I had some freak accidents where grab* didn‚Äôt count but I appealed and was successful. Even uob and grab could not explain why but a genuine grab taxi ride of about $48 was broken down into$32$16Both had grab* description but one was coded with Topup mcc.,btohqsg

Had my card blocked and cancelled right away. It happened after the last DBS outage on Friday. Does it have anything to do with that???,btohqsg
in dbs ibanking app  you can disable the card for online transaction  can enable it when you want to use.. perhaps it can help with all those suspicious transactions,btohqsg
Maybe we should set up a poll to see what % of the population is affected ... seems this issue is spreading by the day,btohqsg

Is there a way to temporarily disable UOB credit card using UOB apps?,btohqsg
Hello! Sorry for the possibly novice question  but for US stocks  is there a fixed rate/amount throughout all brokers? I did watch some videos and found that for SG stocks has that 0.04% + 8%gst = 0.432%  MINIMUM cost (of course excluding trade and platform fees)  is there any such cost for US stocks? I think information overload from online got me nowhere and I can't seem to find anything ü•≤,btohqsg

Anyone know if I would eligible for the 3% S$5K with True Cashback if I buy SS voucher during promo? Thinking about applying this card,btohqsg
If u are ok to buy $5k of vouchers why not just use Citi cashback to buy SS vouchers at 8% cashback? $1k per month for 5 months?,btohqsg
How do u know they is no cash rebate  is there an uob statement or app to show the cash rebate list for your payment transaction?,btohqsg
it caused my base cashback and additional cashback to be wrong.I got $100 base cashback instead of $200 cashback for the quarter.,btohqsg
So  I can do that with TCB and eligible for the promo? I plan to spend as my main card in daily purchase with TCB  then purchase these vouchers as my last resort during the last month,btohqsg
Can but no reason to go for 3% only when u can easily get 8% using other cards,btohqsg

All these discount brokers try to make some money off you with high FX spreads. Same for changing FX with banks  don't do it!Use brokers like Interactive Brokers if you want to change digital FX.Always compare with interbank FX rates before you change FX whether on broker platforms or on prepaid card platforms.,btohqsg
Have to add up all the real 'costs' before you do anything on a platform I guess. Some platforms are just good for the signup benefits. Clock the necessary to open the account and get reward  then close the account.Others are better for long term trading/holding. So far my recommendations for long term trading/holding if you are a retail size customer are Interactive Brokers and SCB Online Trading.,btohqsg

TLDR:HSBC EGA GIRO  Cardup/ipaymy  Citi Payallhttps://youtu.be/-tV6F8NEjQQ,btohqsg
For US stocks/ETF  I compared most of the online brokerage in terms of FX rate and fees. The best low fee and good FX rate for small sum investment will be interactive broker. I dca small amount (100 USD) every month but the fee is only 0.38 USD.Fx rate wise  the conversion is good but need to pay a fee per transaction. Thus  it is advisable to convert only above 1000 SGD to USD per transaction.,btohqsg
Probably not if you are look at how many miles you can earn per dollar. But the card can earn miles for most general spend categories.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  does HSBC Every Rewards+ give 1% rebate for HDB loans paid via GIRO?,btohqsg

Just be mindful of the deduction dates and ensure you have sufficient balance in your account.,btohqsg
Yes. Though you have to weigh the cost vs benefits of1) Using CPF to pay  then put cash in high yield accounts/FD/T-bill/SSB2) HSBC 1% Cashback and etcWhich one is more beneficial for you,btohqsg
Currently using CPF to pay  but not enough so need top up cash. So that‚Äôs why trying to get back some cash via EGA üòÖ,btohqsg

Gd afternoon to allSi FuAny of u having problems with Hsbc revolution points?I noticed that the points i got don't tally with my spent.Every single of my transactions falls within the white list.example: I spent $500.( 10x points for white list purchase). I understand the dollar round up thing but it wouldn't be that far from 5000pts that I supposed to get.in the end the points i got are only3500..Is there anyway to check which transaction didn't give 10x points?,btohqsg
Thank you. I appreciate the insight üí™üèª,btohqsg
HSBC Revo card works on a white list method.. so that's a bit dangerous unless you are very very sure the merchant is included.,btohqsg
Yes  as long as there is activityhttps://youtu.be/G_knBWbfw9Q,btohqsg
It's a good entry level card  you may also consider other citi miles card options in this videohttps://youtu.be/lyPKS4IOMuw,btohqsg
Yes  usually I have one or two transactions don‚Äôt get 9x  you can call CS  but sometimes the effort not worth it  unless big items missing,btohqsg
the most lame is HSBC Movie Card... don't earn 10x,btohqsg

Hey folks  I have a standard chartered simply credit card which gives 1.5% cash back  the annual fee was waived for the first two years  and I suspect they might charge the annual fee this upcoming July 2023  is there anyway to avoid this charges? Call them to waive it off?,btohqsg
Call in to request for waiver  SC shouldn't be too difficult,btohqsg
ya if they dun waiver  jus ask to cancel  confirm they will go and do the waiver,btohqsg
UOB just rejected my fee waiver  I requested to cancel.Then they say retention department will call me in a few days. Will update again,btohqsg
Wishing you all the best. May you get the fees waived.I understand some cards have auto fee waiver schemes such as EVOL 3 spends a month for 12 months or Singtel-UOB must charge at least Singtel billBut for VS PPV KFCC etc it is all unknown,btohqsg
In 2022 I have experience from SC whereby if you dont hit the min spend amount for the year  they wont waive off. The CSA or whoever in charge of this can‚Äôt overwrite the system also. It‚Äôs not even a ‚Äúthey will appeal and try‚Äù kind of scenario like UOB its a ‚Äúthe rules are the rules I also cannot help‚Äù kind of scenario.Idk if their policies have changed in the past 1 year. So best is you call in/online chat with them early to ask. Else you will have to pay for 1 more year‚Äôs annual fee before you can cancel,btohqsg
Good luck Chris. Quite an annoying process cuz UOB also don‚Äôt state if there is a min spend for auto waiver (based on UOB ONE card),btohqsg
Ya for UOB one i managed to waive off then faster cancel the card.,btohqsg
annual fee are charged for the upcoming year and not the year that has past  so if you are asking them to cancel the card they should not charge you.,btohqsg
it still depends on your spending in the past year  at least for SC. Eg if in 2021 you hit the min spend $12k then 2022 they will waive off. I also asked to cancel  their response is can but you still need to pay off the annual fee. Suck thumb lor else if you keep fighting them you end up paying interest for overdue statementü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
If you really enjoy the card  just cancel early and sign up for the card again,btohqsg
What about those debit card. UOB charge me fee also sia,btohqsg
Question: is there any way to know what is the min spend for the cards?,btohqsg
Just go the cashier tell them u want to buy,btohqsg
Yes. Is there a min spend amount like what OCBC stated for all their cards?,btohqsg
for SC they stated in the terms and condition.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt see any min Auto fee waiver min threshold in SCB Rewards+ or SimplyCash ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
means they removed this info lor. previously i was holding on to SC Spree and their T&C got say. not every bank will tell you upfront also  like DBS live fresh and UOB Absolute also they dont mention,btohqsg
hi all just to check  for EGA it's ok to withdraw from the account right? I do not need to ensure that the average balance is always higher than the previous month right?,btohqsg
so after reading thru so many experience of others abt annual fee  you gotta be proactive when it comes to this lor.,btohqsg

Hello expert  just now I got a call from SC (i think personal loan site)  they ask me to do income data verification thru SC mobile app  and this is to increase my credit limit (up to 250k)  and he said that I can use that to apply for personal loan for 2% (special rate)  and this is under some special offer 1 time per year for chosen people only.And that loan I can use it to apply for bonus saver investment which will give 7.8% per year.. roughly the info is like above.My question is  is anyone has encountered such call n offer? Is this a scam/legit? Is this a very good scheme that I shouldn‚Äôt pass? Any catch?Any thoughts?,btohqsg
At least for 7.8% is not truehttps://youtu.be/4P65pCuddXE,btohqsg
It is possible to take a balance transfer at 2% p.a. and place into SCB Wealthsaver at 5% p.a. There was such a promo in the past but I'm not sure what's the latest offer from SCB.Only for NEW TO SCB PRIORITY BANKING. And must maintain the relationship for min 6 months.,btohqsg

thinking to get citi rewards (and instarem amaze) for its sign up bonusand hsbc rev for travel spendingbut don't see the need to continue using Citi rewards since hsbc rev seems to cover almost everything for 4mpd (?)so my qn is can I cancel Citi rewards after getting the signup bonus or must I hold the card for a certain period of time?,btohqsg
Which card is that? I have 2 card with scb and never use  annual fee waiver always successful,btohqsg
why are you keeping unused cards though?,btohqsg
I called them to cancel  they said no fee charge  so just keep it üòÄ,btohqsg
the rationale for cancelling all unused cards is so that you can qualify for new-to-bank status asap and reap all the sign up bonuses. usually takes 1 year after cancellation to get that status back,btohqsg
Spree. And so far thats my only encounter of annual fee not being waived. The rest of the banks will waive after some appeal or i just cancel before i finish the fee waiver term after i get the rewards,btohqsg
Thanks  I will not apply that card üëç,btohqsg
Hsbc revo is based on whitelist  Crmc + amaze have wider coverage,btohqsg
-There are legit calls from banks to promote their loan packages.-They generally aren't good  usually there's advertised interest rates but that's excluding the admin fees etc. Ask for the EIR (effective interest rate)- If you have guaranteed 7.8% p.a. investments with Deposit Insurance Scheme please let me know too üòÖ such numbers i can bet its not guaranteedApologies realized thats the bonus saver account  do you actually hit all of their requirements to qualify for the 7.88% p.a.?tl;dr  if it sounds like free money  it probably isn't.,btohqsg
