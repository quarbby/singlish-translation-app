Today my friend also struggling with this,btohqsg
No  it is not new to me cos my 1st hfe (that expire 11 Sep) was asked to upload payslip  this one i got approval after 1month.I had already put up my 2nd hfe 1mth ago (ie. In Aug  together with payslip) n i got the approval within 3days.So you need to submit so that hdb can expedite the process of your hfe.,btohqsg
Wat was Ur queue number within flat supply?,btohqsg
Way out of supply but got scheduled for appointment. Queue 285 out of 175,btohqsg
Auto email and sms sent to first applicant. Today late morning like 11plus last chinese slot taken.. ard 1230pm got notified,btohqsg
We did not send any email.,btohqsg
Hmm ok.. i didnt recall about upload payslip,btohqsg
Shld have chance based on dropout rate for thc. Good luck.. my is way far out of supply,btohqsg
My opinion:If both of u are Chinese then you need to choose Chinese.But if you have a choice to choose either chinese or others  & if you are thinking easy to sell of course is Chinese but don't forget it is harder to get a unit becos of ethnic distribution ratio.,btohqsg
But I think it is neither here nor there cos might be just few units to choose  worst if the available unit left with 11units (i have mind set on my budget  so price  floor etc are my priority  if the balance 11 units are outside my budget  I cannot take  cant take n cant waive no selection)..  If less than 10 then can ask for waiver. Right?,btohqsg
Someone in chencharu telegram chat just tried asking for waiver when theres 13units for an earlier bto. Outcome not out yet.,btohqsg
Do you think there'll be more bto launches in Yishun?,btohqsg
Will have on next yr.Chenchuru is the 1st project at that areas  and more to come next few yrs . U can read the news on that site planning etc....,btohqsg
I'll suggest u if u want to BTO  please apply for every launch  is not just u want yishun u will definitely get a Q number right.Can't be next project Yishun is on next yr Q2 or Q4 u wait till then what,btohqsg
The rest of the projects will be in chencharu too?,btohqsg
This is true. Still deciding on some factors. Thanks!,btohqsg
Chencharu will likely be their focus over the next launches.. but if you look at the map shared  Yishun still have some random empty plots here and there (yellow plot). Not sure if gazetted for residential or not,btohqsg
Ooo thanks for sharing the information,btohqsg
Just to check:if holding a Q number within supply  can still apply for next project that just launched but before your turn to choose from the 1st project?(I understand if your Q nber is outside supply  you can apply for next project when it is launched).,btohqsg
So the system does not allow me to submit? Or if I submit my 1st one be cancelled n the Q number for the 2nd project is still tbc.,btohqsg
Hi can i check if anything related to HPS can be ignored for those who fully paid for the new hdb bto without applying for any monthly cpf loan ?,btohqsg
If don‚Äôt tk loan  must pay in full during which appt?,btohqsg
That if your HFE state you can't take HDB loan,btohqsg
System wont allow u to submit,btohqsg
I see  ok noted. Thanks to all.,btohqsg
Ok another scenario:After I submitted for Oct bto launch   there is a SBF launch in Nov. I haven't given a Q number yet for the Oct bto that I submitted  can I still submit for Nov SBF?,btohqsg
Usually sbf is launched tgt with btos (im not sure about this anymore though),btohqsg
Don't have this scenario. Because SBF only one time per year. As it comes together w BTO Launch together as per last time data .And u know why now BTO 3 times and 1 time SBF ? Is because they know by the time your BTO results out next SBF launch sure u know your previous results already,btohqsg
So your assumption won't happen.Your OCT BTO Launch already results sure out before next yr February if next SBF is in Feb 2025,btohqsg
As a matter of fact  no more sbf this yr so confirmed 101% your OCT results will be out before next yr sbf launch,btohqsg
Oh I see. Cos I thought I saw something like SBF in Nov 2024 (may be last one for this year?) and Feb 2025 (one abd only going forward?).Ok thanks for the info. If I happen to see the news article I will share here.,btohqsg
Nope only one SBF from this year onwards,btohqsg
Ok thanks all  I guess what I saw was an old article. üëç,btohqsg
Luckily I joined this chat group  I get advise from you all  really appreciate as the  advise from you guys here  definiely clear my doubts & help me for better planning.  You guys are good. üëç,btohqsg
Curious to find out if anyone has inputs to this:Husband - main owner of BTOWife - occupier of BTOIn future if buying another property under Wife‚Äôs name (occupier of BTO only)  does that mean Wife is considered as 0 ownership of property and hence no ABSD on future property?,btohqsg
Thank you for the info! I guess its more of trust here if spouse is ok with this arrangement of being an occupier only?,btohqsg
Yup. Do note that the spouse with the ownership can kick the other spouse out at anytime legally.,btohqsg
Huge risk there. Thank u btw appreciate!,btohqsg
HDB doesnt allow decoupling now though,btohqsg
At least thats what the staff told us when we went to sign papers üòÇ,btohqsg
What u mean doesn‚Äôt allow? Thought we can choose who is the owner and the spouse as occupier?,btohqsg
yes can but the asbd thingy is not allowed,btohqsg
Not referring to 99 to 1 ratio for the private property,btohqsg
Was mentioning in future the next property buy under 1 spouse name (100% ownership) of next property,btohqsg
Hi  just checking  will first timer be void forever if you choose to miss after getting the ballot?,btohqsg
The sbf for 2024 is over already on Feb 2024,btohqsg
Next yr sbf not sure which month  wait for hdb give info..For my pov  go try for Oct BTO first.,btohqsg
i'd think might need pay absd or smth too better to clarify with hdb,btohqsg
There should be a 1 year cooldown (2nd priority) when you discard your number that is purely within range of supply.,btohqsg
If you don't select when you get the chance to (ie when you're called down for appt and there are still units you can choose from  but you don't go for the appt) 1. All existing applications will be voided2. You will be considered 2nd timer for 1 year,btohqsg
For item 1  all existing application will be voided. Could  receive any email from HDB to say that ongoing application has been voided?,btohqsg
From my experience of selecting May 2022 and giving up Aug 2022 application (meaning it would be considered cancelled) I didn't get any email from HDB. On the flat dashboard  the Aug 2022 one status showed cancelled or sth like that.Idk if things have changed since then  so someone else could share if they have recent experience,btohqsg
New rules apply for October 2023For this,btohqsg
Cannot kick unless divorce. I bought a resale under single scheme b4 married. Then hdb checked rom records and by default put my husband as the occupier.,btohqsg
Existing application meaning need reapply for hfe?,btohqsg
Btw when sales launch  will we be able to see the facing direction and floor plan design?,btohqsg
Legally cannot kick? Legally the house is owned by the owner and not the essential occupier.,btohqsg
Parents  sibilings  etc can remove easily as the idea is they can get their own place. But husband and wife considered a compulsory family necleus so cannot anyhow remove,btohqsg
Hi guys can I just ask why for HFE occupier also need to submit payslip ? Cause they won‚Äôt be servicing the loan anyway,btohqsg
My neighbour (other floor)  she own her unit from resale market  and her partner (currently so called 'husband') also own a unit (on the same floor just 3units away) from resale market. They were then became lover. The old units were then enbloc so each selected a 3room unit at SkyResidence.  But before TOP & collection of keys  the women got pregnant & saw her with her new born..  I assume they are then legally married.Hmm not sure hdb is doing a background check on each applicant?,btohqsg
Wa how u know they become lover ?And how u know enbloc all this details,btohqsg
The woman got pregnant and if is married also can be sole owner of an hdb with the Singaporean child,btohqsg
its her ‚Äúneighbour‚Äù pls  shes concerned she will kena trouble ü•π,btohqsg
They got a house each in legitimate way. Nothing wrong  SERS HDB doesn‚Äôt mean they would make alot of money because they bought on resale market and it‚Äôs also price on the remainder value of the house. But they got a new house which is awesome.No one say 2 single neighbours can‚Äôt fall in love with each other leh üòÇ,btohqsg
If they get married have to sell 1 unit.. hdb check rom records periodically,btohqsg
I know because they found out i got married,btohqsg
Let me check with my neighbour üòÄ,btohqsg
No  if they are legally married  then if hdb found out sure ask either one to give up the bto unit. Worst is  if they didn't report to hdb.,btohqsg
Ah so hdb check rom records too.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs to check? What do you want?,btohqsg
I think this is a personal question & also their choice whether to be married or not. If legally married in Singapore  one must give up on it.But  you won't know if they marry overseas but don't declare in Singapore. But this trend of being single but having partners and owing houses is on the rise in Singapore.,btohqsg
Too many such cases already in fact some purposely divorce to have 2 properties..I guess as a matter of fact  its something quite hard for HDB to control or handle.,btohqsg
Normal. Just like cases couple that dont want to divorce in order to keep their hdb that havent reach mop.  But have live separately. Only after mop they divorce. Life is hard for some.,btohqsg
But i can assure u if they were married in sg  hdb would be the first one to know,btohqsg
Singpass wont lie. All our data is there,btohqsg
Yup..this I agree..Also another reason why those divorced rather stay single then get married in Sg..if not they will have to lose their HDB,btohqsg
Thanks all for the valuable opinions of the story I shared earlier. Hmmm  not being kaypoh  as she was the one who seek advise. I will relay to her of the opinions gathered for her own judgement.,btohqsg
Simple. HDB can do the checking. Afterall  HDB is govt agency and if you caught lying or whatever well jeng jeng jeng la,btohqsg
Afterall  let the authority do the job üòä,btohqsg
saw an identical post earlier today by a different account üëÄ,btohqsg
MorningWhats everyone take on the upcoming bto at kembagan?,btohqsg
Not bad. Quite goodVery near mrt  right beside only.

Good night sleep & good connectivity daily haha üëçOct BTO worth a try!,btohqsg
Any other good locations worth considering?,btohqsg

Just to be sure. The budget will be: grants + combined cpf + max or moderate loan. Correct ? Antg above that is a no-no?,btohqsg
anyone have any information on the price roughly at how much for upcoming bto oct? on jurongwest bto.,btohqsg
Don't know. Wait for hdb to give information,btohqsg
Up till then nobody's will know,btohqsg
Je too farHahahahaMight stay putDowngrade years down the road to 2 room then,btohqsg
Can consider reference from June‚Äôs BTO pricing.JE n JW may be similarhttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/news-and-publications/press-releases/HDB-Launches-6938-Flats-in-June-2024-BTO-Exercise,btohqsg

hi  my queue no. is out of supply for the jun2024 project. If I would like to re-apply for a new HFE letter do I cancel my current HFE letter first?,btohqsg
hi~ can anyone advice me.. if mine HFE expiry on nov  can i still go bid on OCT? and renew HFE on nov?,btohqsg
Don't needjust use the current hfe to apply bto in October,btohqsg
Why u want to reapply hfe? Issit your hfe expires before October? Then u want to apply for October bto also?,btohqsg
anybody got any updates on yishun boardwalk progress? üòÅ,btohqsg
If the supply fall below 5 then u can  if ur Q is within supply and more than 5units before flat selection i think you will become 2nd timer for a year,btohqsg
the nov renew the HFE again?,btohqsg
will it affect my application for up coming OCT BTO,btohqsg
mine expires on early nov.. which i not sure i still can go for Oct BTO or i need to apply new HFE in order to apply the upcoming project BTO,btohqsg
No  it will not affect your bto application even your hfe expired after submit bto application,btohqsg
My HFE expire on 10 oct,btohqsg
If you not going to apply for bto in October then don't need reapply,btohqsg
Does anyone know what‚Äôs the benefit for getting a BTO near parents?Search online but abit confuse with the married couple thing,btohqsg
Can go for dinner with them daily,btohqsg
I think get additional chance for balloting. Near parents grant only for resale.,btohqsg
Should i grab 4 room near tampines west mrt $500k or wait for another 5room punggol bto far from mrt $500k,btohqsg
Tamp west BTOs very near MRT right?I have friends got their BTO just completed recently there  not bad location there due to proximity to the MRT & other facilities,btohqsg
The price is like 5 room punggol bto,btohqsg
Thanks ...Yup i agree with u...Need to sacrifice house area for convenience,btohqsg
Best to buy bto within walking distance to mrt. Regardless location. Ulu or central,btohqsg
Usually Within the mrt has alot of amenities,btohqsg
hi morning  I am new here. May I know where can I check the latest new launch bto?,btohqsg
As well as sales of balance,btohqsg
May I know does anyone have any idea  will.hdb inform us via email on the booking flat appointment date ?,btohqsg
Should be both sms n email,btohqsg
Tampines got anymore empty plot of land for BTO?Just for open discussion~,btohqsg
Yea saw this  wonder got any other land plot,btohqsg
Think with plus  gov will launch bto beside tampines MRT. Still have many reserve sites in tampines.,btohqsg
This one think can build a lot BTO haha,btohqsg
Oh no its a natural park,btohqsg
Ohh I referring to the circle at the bottom,btohqsg
Hi  just want to confirm if proximity housing grant  PHG is only for resale. Bto no PHG üò≠,btohqsg
What's a family grant? Was looking at EHG and I saw family grant as well.,btohqsg
I think for resale they will have grant depending on the applicant. If single applicant den get singles grant. This case they apply as family so family grant.,btohqsg
So family grant is also for resale only?,btohqsg
Eventhough bto has no phg  it is half the price or more from market value. So its more value for money purchase.For Example: 4room resale is 650k market price. Bto is 300k with fresh 99 years lease. After ehg grant probably paying only 200k-250k. Depends on ur grant amount,btohqsg
Regarding downpaymentAny one has info on thisReading up on hdb website make up eye üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
For BTO  Downpayment required when going for signing of agreement. % depends if you‚Äôre take hdb/no loan or bank loan.Can be paid with CPF,btohqsg
With the new increase to LTV  after 1st down payment of 5%  2nd one is 20%? Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
Hello  just need some advice. Assuming 1 person in the household is working now  would it be better to buy a 2 or 3 room bto then upgrade in the future or buy a 4 room bto now?The concern is unsure if in the future both couple will work (instead of 1)  income for both will increase and house prices in the future will increase.,btohqsg
For HDB loan If LTV is at 80%  Downpayment is 10% first den 10%.New LTV at 75%  Downpayment is 10% first den 15%.,btohqsg
Oh  so they won't just tell me how much (price) I can afford but also the type (no of room) I can afford? Sorry  I haven't applied for HFE yet so I'm not sure how it looks like,btohqsg
Can gauge depending on the 1 person‚Äôs income and current CPF balance,btohqsg
Its depends on ur affordability. U need to check ur cpf oa amount  loan eligibility and grants. Hence apply for hfe first is a good idea. I also 1 person working and i bought 4room. So my suggestion if u can afford 4room go for 4room. If not 3 room is still ok. 2 room is still ok as well if u really low budget. Later after mop can still upgrade,btohqsg
If can afford 4 room is best. Coz u be waiting for the bto for 3-5years so might as well make it worth it,btohqsg
No point buying big house over ur budget. Coz when comes to key collection if cant pay ur bto will forfeit.,btohqsg
Hi may I ask if eligible for cpf grant do I need to submit any documents to cpf . Thanks,btohqsg
U will see that in your HFE,btohqsg
For BTO  no proximity housing grant. But you will have Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS)First-timer families: Up to 30% of BTO flats  30% of SBF flatsSecond-timer families: Up to 5% of BTO flats  3% of SBF flats,btohqsg
All the eligible available grants (Enhanced Housing Grant  Housing  CPF Housing Grants for Resale Flats  proximity grant) will be shown in your HFE letter.,btohqsg
Is only eligible for married couple?,btohqsg
You can find the Eligibility conditions over here.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes?anchor=mcps,btohqsg
Ok thanks .  Mine is eligibility for EHG  so do I need to do anything for it.,btohqsg
Can I request my levy to be deduct or add in to my cpf together with house price? Anyone done it?,btohqsg
Hi. Can I ask who have purchased BTO before. Can we leave 20k cpf money behind as a buffer? Without clean wipe,btohqsg
Combined with my partner is 40k.. correct ?,btohqsg
Thanks for reply bro. Appreciate it,btohqsg
U google u will know the ans already.,btohqsg
This apply one person 20k or 2 combined 20k,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think so. It will be deducted from your sales proceeds. You can try writing into HDB to ask. Do let me know what they reply back. I‚Äôm curious on this too. Thanks!,btohqsg
This is optional  you can choose not to as well  for any one or two accounts,btohqsg
Its like a safety measure for you incase you not working for few months your loan can be paid for few more months,btohqsg
other than that I am not sure if this is a must or not,btohqsg
Hi all ..last time i received 20k grant for my bto..when i sell and get another bto..must i return back the 20k or just pay the levy,btohqsg
U only need to pay levy if you buy another bto or new ec. If you buy resale or private ppty no need pay levy. The grant+accrued interest will need to be return to ur own cpf. Not to the gov,btohqsg
Just came back from HDB. Yes I have to appeal . First you have to add up your levy with your current cpf total and HLE price if it is enough then can.,btohqsg
How to count for tampines 4 room,btohqsg
A bit confuse of the 8.2 and 61.6,btohqsg
for the upcoming bto  anyone have the prices?,btohqsg
Good morning.. May I ask where can we check how many units are still available for selection for past SBF exercise in Feb24? I believe the selection had started sometime in Aug24.. I have queue number but out of supply.,btohqsg
Ok  I'll go check that  thank you. I checked my Flat Dashboard but there is no update..,btohqsg
May I have the link to that group chat? Thank you!üòä,btohqsg
what do yall think will be the most contested site for the upcoming bto?,btohqsg
ü•π I hope it's not kallang/whampoa,btohqsg
I think the open concept is confirmed le for kallang/whampoa.. hahahhttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hdb-new-open-concept-layout-no-walls-beams-bto-kallang-whampoa-4365806,btohqsg

Hey guys any bto coming this 2025 4th quarter at woodlands admiralty area,btohqsg
No news on Woodlands 2025 bto,btohqsg
Hi need help. Can some angel help add me into tanjongrhuriverfront channel pls,btohqsg
can anyone help to link me to Chencharu Hills BTO channels?,btohqsg
Thanks but there is only 1 member,btohqsg
Strange to me too‚Ä¶ something is wrong with my telegram setup‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Can you try exiting and rejoining?,btohqsg
If invited for flat selection and you reschedule will the next few numbers take your spot and you have lesser options to choose from?,btohqsg
Yes if u delay  ppl behind u will choose first.,btohqsg
Can't be hdb wait for u come back and delayed the whole whole from choosing the units or delay others just for u ma,btohqsg
ah ok. means if there is say 20 units to choose from and you dont want the project then can just push back the appointment until left 10 units (with race quota) then can waive the flat selection without incurring 2nd timer penalty?,btohqsg
or is there a limit to how far back you can delay the appointment? like a certain number of numbers? 50? like 5 days assuming 10/day? then if you still dont appear then its non-selection and you get hit with 2nd timer penalty?,btohqsg
When u need to delay ur selection hdb will assume u not selecting yet until u go at the set timingI dont think can fix the date to reschedule selection,btohqsg
if this is allowed a lot ppl gonna abuse it,btohqsg
yes but what if at the selected delayed timing number of flats is under 10 (able to waive selection without penalty)?,btohqsg
Cannot  once u miss appointment set by hdb,btohqsg
They will by default assume u not selecting until u go select,btohqsg
No fixed date  just 12pm or 4pm on dates after ur supposed selection date  until no more,btohqsg
what if by then none available to select?,btohqsg
Cause once u miss appointment date hdb will just assume its a non selection  till u select,btohqsg
Hi guys just to confirm  we are only allowed to choose one BTO per launch right?,btohqsg
You can actually appoint someone on behalf to select rather than you reschedule.Understand that you have commitments but no offence; there are those who have been applying for BTO/SBF for years can't even get a Q number  would desperately love to be in your position to sacrifice their time to select a unit lol üòÖ,btohqsg
How strict is the hfe application?,btohqsg
hi guys can i check if i apply for this round bto chances are i will miss the sbf launch because results for bto will take a few months right?,btohqsg
SBF only once a year in Feb,btohqsg
but results for bto will take few months right,btohqsg
Is this year Oct bto out already?,btohqsg
Your time and our time different leh already put October launch u expect Sep launch?,btohqsg
I read this round thinking it‚Äôs happening now lolll,btohqsg
I have a question here:My aunt got her Q number within supply (her Q number 15x  total supply i think is 400 units for 2room) for Yishun (june launched)  but not yet called for selection.So if she submit for  Oct launch (amk her 1st preferred town)  will the yishun Q number became invalid?,btohqsg
Thank you very much. Just to clarify:the system won't allow her to submit this AMK launch?,btohqsg
Stand corrected but it will block her from applying,btohqsg
Already within supply can't apply next launch no matter what,btohqsg
Hi everyone  i heard a lot of potential competition for bayshore  kallang and kembangan area this oct.Wanted to ask how the pasir ris project would be like overall as they somewhat have a seaview as well. And if any (far) east siders can give their pointers on living at the end of the train lines?,btohqsg
Oh ya  my brother is going to apply bto at Pasir Ris  cos very convenient  very close to Downtown east  mrt & next to Aranda country club.,btohqsg
Anyone got appointment for june bto flat appointment already?,btohqsg
Playing devil's advocate here  Singapore seaview is just industrial tanker views.Saltwater will corrode metal more easily too.,btohqsg
couples that want these components must remember that the price may be > $500k for a typical 4 room in the east. actually i have a feeling it's more than $550k ü´£ (think of affordability & waiting time)for pasir ris  since it's opp the interchange  highly likely very noisy but yeah ofc you can install sound proof windows  curtains etc ü´†,btohqsg
Anyone here appealed for the hfe before? Ideally if successful ones. Can pm me? Thanks,btohqsg
how grant is calculated? It‚Äôs much lower than I expected  and I didn‚Äôt realize I was earning that much! lol,btohqsg
hello! i have a queue number outside of supply for holland v (june 2024 launch)  does anybody know whether HDB will inform us when all the selection/ bidding before our queue number has been done? or is there a way to check what units have been taken alrdy?,btohqsg
Bcos the Costa ris when it's out the price was 300+ for 4room,btohqsg
i dunno la brader. i dont work for hdb la lol. just wait the upcoming oct sales launch to see the price üëÄ,btohqsg
Hahaha no worries man. Just asking only la. Get house is good enough for me man,btohqsg
Hey guys  any idea if the top floor of new BTOs would be hot/high chance of leaks?,btohqsg
er..i also applying for years and always get +30-50 out of supply. for feb bto they smsed me 2 days prior to the appointment then the night before cancelled because all apartments booked and i had to take suddenly leave and wasted a day of leave. it doesnt reflect well at my workplace. this oct is also one such instance of out of supply yet got a number. so finding out a way to retain first timer without getting shafted again and cancel my trip. bro i rather they give me a firm number and a firm date way in advance then screwing me like this. its ultimate spare tyre feel. always on call. either within supply or out of supply. out of supply with a number is the worst. still love to be in my position?,btohqsg
Ohh That sounds quite bad.Do they arrange it such last minute?What if you are travelling? Lols,btohqsg
Imho it is what it is. If u cant take leave then just appoint someone else to go down on ur behalf.,btohqsg
Im missing one month of my payslipWill hdb make and exception for the hfe application,btohqsg
Ya  You can always appoint someone else to select  if not just take leave. If take leave cannot  then take MC.Nothing  is more important than selecting a flat that you are going to stay for many years to come.In 10 years time  the only person who remember your OT and hardwork at workplace is your kid.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt get the highest floor will do2nd/3rd highest all goodEg: LV 18 highest. Can get 17/16/15,btohqsg
How far out are u? I also out like #411 out of 228. Based on thc exp  chinese quota might run out for those out of supply,btohqsg
Usually they will infd u 2-3 weeks in advance for u to make arrangements/ leave/ time off etcThe process quite fast de too. Within 30-35mins settle for mine,btohqsg
Depends on the fall out rate. Pray for more drop üìâ out. So even. If u out of supply by 50-100 still got chance to choooseBut just that stack facing & floor lvls not so desirable la .,btohqsg
Would like to know  if a couple who own a 5rm bto (within mop) divorced before 35yo. Does anyone of them still can own the 5rm legally or must sell?,btohqsg
Either one who has care and control of the kids can keep the house.,btohqsg
Take My situation as exampleNow i have kids  if stay already haven't MOPMust sell or who has the care and control can take the flat with the childIf now waiting for key collection i separate with my wife  same   if my wife don't want the flat but has care and control of the child she must give me permission to use the child name to continue to get this HDB unit.,btohqsg
then dead. ah my bad it wasnt 2 days. it was 4 days. 4 days to prep for something entirely unfamiliar. bto first timer after all. amazing right,btohqsg
26th send notice for 29th 1030am. then 28th 8pm send notice dont need to go down. this is ultimate spare tyre booty call man.,btohqsg
i think they cater to 30% numbered out of supply. eg 100 supply they give number to 130 ppl. so 30pax spare tyre,btohqsg
Before that 2 weeks ago shld also have another sms,btohqsg
Ya i had 2 wk before and 3d before,btohqsg
it shld be sent exactly 2 weeks prior,btohqsg
rather they just throw to sbf. then lump all the locations sbf together. numbered out of supply is the worst,btohqsg
If you have been working that month  are u able to ask ur HR to provide?If you weren't working  has your partner worked for the full 12 months?Personally I also missed out one month  but since my partner worked the full 12  our HFE was still approved,btohqsg
Why? I‚Äôm interested in the rationale,btohqsg
Bto quality so lousy these days?,btohqsg
it's not as if stay 2nd/3rd highest floor won't leak.Highest floor leak = HDB cover  anything else = you and neighbor share cost.,btohqsg
Wa this is very useful info.. until now then i know this after your sharing.. i booked a unit at the highest floor and was worried abt who to look for if i experience leakage,btohqsg
Oic.. my booked flat is at tengah  so will be under cck town council,btohqsg
Haha mine is more to leakage.. i cannot unchoose le as im now waiting for key collection,btohqsg
Besides leakage what about pests? Will the top floor have more lizards? Less likely to have cockroaches?,btohqsg
if your neighbor is hoarder  any floor will have cockroaches,btohqsg
Hi can I check if my queue number for the previous project is above the flat available units ( meaning likelihood not able to get ) can I apply for the next coming project ?,btohqsg
can apply if ur queue no. is out of supply,btohqsg
Oh but can I check if I have queue number already can I apply for the next project ?,btohqsg
Or if my queue number is too high can I drop my this project? Will I be penalised?,btohqsg
If your q no it outside supply  yes u can,btohqsg
If left 10 and below units to select or run out of ethnic quota then won‚Äôt be penalised,btohqsg
No need wait  just apply whatever launch  is not 100% can get a Q so why wait 2 yrs  1yr 3 launch  2 years 6 launch. don't waste time,btohqsg
I'd say  apply only if u don't mind getting the project u apply for,btohqsg
To many thing to consider.Price factor (every year bto prices increase) cost of buildingThe timeline for you to get your flatAnd many moreIn another 2 year time whether any changes towards bto rules  youWon't know too,btohqsg
Surely bto price will go up by 2027. 400k-500k for 4room at least,btohqsg
U got 2 chance to bto. So why wait lol. Eventhough. 2nd timer is hard but still got chance. Atleast 1st bto can fully pay the 2nd bto. Just my 2cents,btohqsg
Hi just wanna ask  im a bto first timer applicant but i didnt attend the unit selection so right now im a second timer for a year. That 1 year is it from selection date or from bto application date ?,btohqsg
And if i were to apply now as second timer. My ballot will be affected. Does my grants also consider for second timers?,btohqsg
Selection date. No grants won‚Äôt be affected as you did not take any at that point in time.,btohqsg
Just wondering whats the likelihood of second timer securing a bto,btohqsg
Very hard but not impossible. Depends on the project application rate for the 2nd timer,btohqsg
Some say easier to secure  bto if apply under mgps,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm not wrong HDB gives 5% of the development to the second timers,btohqsg
Need opinion...is 4room for $550k in tampines expensive?,btohqsg
Hi  I like to check that I got invited for a flat selection under SBF then my bto also in a queue. How can I do to remain my bto queue and forfeit my SBF?,btohqsg
Is your bto q no within supply? If so  U can try write in to hdb. But no guarantee.Someone managed to get waiver before  shared in this forum,btohqsg
The BTO q is within supply,btohqsg
Aranda Breeze  Miltonia Breeze & Vanda Breeze,btohqsg
Bto is never expensive. Always below market price. Maybe urs get to 550k because higher level. Low level is cheaper,btohqsg
Okla that price. Now i see resale price for tampines area 800k already for 4 room just mop,btohqsg
Ur welcome. I wont be surprise when ur bto mop can reach 1Million there,btohqsg
Thanks..appreciate it...i have just read the new plus and prime condition..,btohqsg
My friend same situation. She went to HDB on the actual selection date for SBF and did not select any. The staff checked and assured her bto queue not affected. She went for her BTO selection on the given date and selected her BTO unit.You might want go to HDB on your given SBF date and confirmed that if you reject this selection  your BTO selection is not affected. üôÇ,btohqsg
Okay. Thank you for the advice,btohqsg
I probably will go down and check,btohqsg
But your friend also first timer?,btohqsg
Usually  what's the first timing of selection of unit in the afternoon? 2pm?,btohqsg
How long is each selection timing? 15min or 30min?,btohqsg
About 1hr if no issues and if the couple select unit fast.,btohqsg
They will lock the units for 15mins during selection?,btohqsg
The one after that couple/person who delays selection cannot select until the couple/person selects a unit,btohqsg
There is no time limit  heard got a few times ppl wait 2 hours lol but hearsay la,btohqsg
Previously i seen timings 0900  0915 or 0930 etc  shared b4. Wonder how it works,btohqsg
Actually i got a selection date but cannot find last q no. Wonder how many are in front of me that day,btohqsg
Last queue number of the dayOnly if you haveofficially received your appointment date  you can view the last queue number of the day from 12:00 AM onwards everyday  throughthis link.Help provide information by sending this toyour project's group chat  PM'ing me@smchua  or filling up thisGoogle Form. You will help the community determine the number of appointments for the day  and the dropout rate for your flat type.‚ö†Ô∏è If you haven't officially received your appointment date  this will appear blank.Updated as at 3 Apr 2024,btohqsg
L Hcan refer to this on how to check last queue number,btohqsg
Oh out of supply Q number can drop out? Like I'm 30s outside supply  can I ask to drop out? Cos I guess if hdb call me for selection may be left with 11 units but not my desired unit.  And with 11 units if I don't choose I may be classified as 2nd timer then.,btohqsg
you'll have to appeal with HDB,btohqsg
No guarantee. To prevent applicants from abusing the system. I believe 2nd timer will have difficulty getting waiver approved.,btohqsg
which project u applied for? just curious,btohqsg
cause usually 30+ out of supply might have a lot more than 11 units left,btohqsg
If one drives  mrt is not an consideration,btohqsg
Not a apple to apple comparsion,btohqsg
Punggol got near SIT University one,btohqsg
The location dynamic also different  too,btohqsg
Your poll very general.Those prefer mrt one sure vote woodland.But those working near Punggol then vote Punggol. Because far from mrt also no Issue since works is already not far away,btohqsg
Where got ppl own self like own poll one,btohqsg
Ya from Oct 2023  if u get called up and reject  penalty is 2nd timer for a year  and subsequent queue no. all cancelled,btohqsg
E.g Feb 2024 u ballot  June 2024 also ballotBoth got queue no. but if Feb 2024 call u up first u reject  June will also be cancelled,btohqsg
In ur own pov. Poll stops once reach 100 votes,btohqsg
Hi everyone  wanted to ask on the parent proximity scheme.The upcoming oct BTO project is within proximity and i will be reciving a grant + an additional vote during ballot. But i dont intend to inform anyone in my family for the BTO application and i am very sure they will not sell during the MOP period.Thing is  will1. HDB notify them without my consent? (Cuz i cant opt out of proxomity)2. What if down the road of 10yrs MOP  they really sold the flat. Ie. Year 7 of MOP they decide to sell  will my unit be at risk?I dont mind the financial losses from grant returns if that is only the max penalty,btohqsg
BTO u dont get extra grant for proximity,btohqsg
But During selection HDB will do video call with ur family,btohqsg
U can actually dont apply for the close proximity  just dont get extra ballot chance only,btohqsg
Thanks a lot for the information  i vaguely recall during the jun launch that i was within proximity  it was auto included. How do i select to remove?,btohqsg
Pretty sure u can just skip the page,btohqsg
I applied once before and skipped the proximity page cause its not compulsory to fill,btohqsg
Maybe OP wants to sell next time üòÇ,btohqsg
Theres tons of better BTOs in Oct,btohqsg
1. If I recall correctly  HDB will notify them if you apply for proximity. If you don't want them to be informed  better not to apply,btohqsg
Hi everyone  to get a roof unit or one Lv below roof. What are the pros n cons of roof unit,btohqsg
Nope similar pricing to bedok. All east area mature estate min this price deRegale much more expensive. BTO cheap le,btohqsg
$550k for the jun tamp bto near tamp Safra riteWhich lvl is that roughly for that price?,btohqsg
Does HDB invite for selection om Sat and sun?,btohqsg
Sat not opened. Sun to Fri,btohqsg
Oh that consider mid floor ard lv 8,btohqsg
Tampines beside safra had >60 application rates. I recalled very highly sought after,btohqsg
That means ur highest floor close to $600k? Ard $580k?,btohqsg
2nd time already. Pls do not advertise here.,btohqsg
Do we get to see the 3d mock up of all btos at toa payoh hub?,btohqsg
When can we make the appt? Launch is this oct but duno when exact date,btohqsg
Pros - privacy  windy  quieterCons - you will be the last one to exit the lift  if the lift breaks down u have to take the stairs and climb all the way up to your house  may have to deal with leakage problem (if you get the older resale unit)So far these are what i gather online..,btohqsg
Find a place where u know people if u buying resale. If lift ever breaks down u have a temp hideout üòÅ,btohqsg
Wa even for my out of supply Q number?So in this case I better go down if I was called for selection  same time will ask for waiver if I didn't select any units. Unless I receive sms before the appt date/time that I don't need to go yo hdb office as ethnic quota reached.,btohqsg
Yup even if it is out of supply. how out though? and how many units left?,btohqsg
Ok thanks for the advise n info. Will see how it goes.,btohqsg
<5 for sbf  <10 for bto,btohqsg
Haha i asking how out is her queue xD,btohqsg
Cause usually for BTO  if is out by 30 ish will have quite a lot of units left,btohqsg
Auto no penalty for bto is <10 units left  or <5 units left,btohqsg
Can share your new proj q no?,btohqsg
If q no is very small n u r a first timer  it is easier to justify to hdb to ask for waiver of penalty.,btohqsg
Hello. I'm confused over this. Hope someone can enlighten me. If the monthly mortgage payment is $2184.My partner and I combined contributions will be only 1500+-. The remaining amount have to pay by cash. However my partner and I want to leave behind 40k(20k each) during the BTO application period.So my question is   the balance amount that we need to pay by cash for our mortgage  can we tap on the 20k we leave behind?,btohqsg
If you are going to tap it  why not just use the 20k for deposit to reduce your interest? Instead of using that amount to pay monthly interest  not the best use of the 20k.,btohqsg
I mean for down payment all I will use the cpf all to payment all,btohqsg
I might need to tap on the 20k to pay for the balance that I may need to pay in cash,btohqsg
You can always adjust how much to pay using cpf/cash any time during the mortgage period.Some may have more cash and decide to use more cash to pay instead of cpf,btohqsg
No clues. Even those who worked in hdb also won't know,btohqsg

Suprising about geylang. Close to kallang but came last,btohqsg
Its close to kallang rather than woodlands or jurong i mean üòÖ. 3km driving distance. Also close  to mattar mrt. For me not bad,btohqsg
Anyone using Usin Aircon? Their workmanship and quality used are inferior. Lots of leaking and ‚Äúsweating‚Äù of pipes,btohqsg
Which brand? Or do you mean servicing contractor?,btohqsg
Call them back ask them rectify?,btohqsg
Have done so. Every few weeks the issue will recur. Only temporary resolve,btohqsg
Speaking of aircon  anyone got affordable reliable aircon service to recommend? I'm staying at woodlands üò¨,btohqsg
For me I use them for aircon service . Price I find ok . U can call to check out .https://fengsheng.sg/contact-us/,btohqsg
can check out Bright House as well  can easily call for a quotebrighthouse.sg,btohqsg
Oh wah..they also provide other services,btohqsg
Heard from friends Aircon Uncle workmanship is good. Just avoid Usin Aircon company. Slightly cheaper but  will regret it and give lots of headache  need open up trunking/pipe/redo paintwork etc,btohqsg
Does anyone know how we can check the application rate when Oct bto is launched? (No of unit : No of applicants)Thanks in advance,btohqsg
When launch then will.have the link to check. Just wait,btohqsg
Oh! So there‚Äôs a link available for us to view before we apply?,btohqsg
That's why some ppl wait for last day then apply IF your concerns is location is not an issue to u and u just want to have a better chance to get a Q when u see the rate of particular projects is lower,btohqsg
But if u just want Bayshore so no matter what's the rate u gonna apply Bayshore then checking the application rate may not be a factor things to u,btohqsg
Understand! Thanks a lot for taking the time to explain. I didn‚Äôt manage to find such a link in previous launch. Hopefully I will see it this time.,btohqsg
Can follow BTO appointment tracker  the owner always posts infohttps://t.me/btoapptdates,btohqsg
hi can i check  if i apply for the upcoming oct BTO  when will the results be released?,btohqsg
Been wanted to ask this  I this it‚Äôs discussed before but to get the clarity I am asking again.I like to really understand and calculate if we really stand a chance.Regarding the racial quota allocation  I am aware of the allocation for different race % .Would like to understand the below in detail.1. Is it calculated for each block or project or by the location of the project?( example: I apply for Bedok projects but later I want to choose the units in Kembangan  so here do they calculate % only looking at  a block in the project in Kembangan or overall Kembangan BTO or overall Bedok projects)2. How is the Queue number and Racial quota allocation process works?3. If I am applying for a 5 room unit  is the queue numbers and the quota calculated only based on the 5 room only or is it project based.,btohqsg
I think apply to the block and room type.,btohqsg
yes ethnic quota applies to estate  block  and flat type. when you have a successful ballot you will be able to see the quota for your applied flat type,btohqsg
this is what you will see,btohqsg
The information shown is for the type of flat you choose?,btohqsg
Hello  I want to join the Tampines Green  Group,btohqsg
under Tampines  if you are under Feb sbf. it's in that discussion,btohqsg
anyone knows when will the october bto be open?,btohqsg
No  should be after 15th Oct,btohqsg
Hi anyone know a telegram group for Ghim Moh ascent bto,btohqsg
For the June bto is start on 19 June,btohqsg
The blocks got to be uploaded on hdb map services then have chance for launch to be soon.,btohqsg
Does bto get launched on fri? Hdb updated the blocks on hdb map services. Means launching soon.. just wondering if its gonna be early next week,btohqsg
I think it's early next week probably. got maintenance notice till 7th Oct,btohqsg
HiWhere do u see the blocks?,btohqsg
Pan to the bto using landmarks such as mrt. Or search by typing major landmarks in search box then click red hdb icon on the left,btohqsg
Theres gonna be 3 blocks for amk bto beside library,btohqsg
OhOkCoz i dun see it for the kembagan site,btohqsg
The Ang Mo Kio blocks are closer to Yio Chu Kang MRT than Ang Mo Kio MRT.,btohqsg
Actually from there it‚Äôs about 10mins walk to amk mrt . Try walking to yck mrt it‚Äôs at least 30mins,btohqsg
library is not 10 mins walk away  and it's even further than library.,btohqsg
is in between but still slightly nearer to amk station. definitely going to be more than 10mins walk but yck will be longer & unsheltered.,btohqsg
walking to amk station at least its cutting through shops/void decks,btohqsg
Then what is better than this AMK?,btohqsg
As someone living at AMK  I won't want to live at that area la.Gonna be expensive judging by 2022 AMK BTO  and probably under Plus scheme.You can try walking from AMK MRT to library.,btohqsg
Take for example one recent BTO project: Central Weave at Ang Mo Kio. This is Ang Mo Kio; let me zoom in  Central Weave is right at the town centre. Let me zoom in a little bit more. It is next to the MRT and bus interchange. The market is there  the hawker centre is there  Ang Mo Kio Hub is nearby. So location  location  location. This is an excellent location; this is a highly desirable project. HDB‚Äôs selling price had to reflect these attributes. So  the prices for the biggest flats at Central Weave ‚Äì the 5-Room and 3-Gen flats ‚Äì ranged from $713 000 to $877 000  before grants. Even then  these flats were heavily discounted off their true market value. Some people complained that these prices were exorbitant and unaffordable. Yet these units were heavily oversubscribed. More than 6 500 households applied for just 372 such flats ‚Äì 17 applicants for every flat! Clearly  these applicants must have found the Central Weave project affordable  and thought that the prices offered them good value. And no doubt many hoped their flats would fetch strong resale prices later on.,btohqsg
Lhl say till the location is so good,btohqsg
I applied for that 5 room  luckily queue number out of quota.,btohqsg
AMK Central Weave  5 room  720k to 877k.,btohqsg
But im pretty sure the resale value is also high. Probably 1m plus for 5room,btohqsg
Haven finish construction. Those who got central weave are lucky cos no plus restrictions,btohqsg
U were 1 of the 17 applicants vying for 1 unit,btohqsg
playing with numbers  first timers application rate was around 8  but 2nd timer = 182 üòÇ,btohqsg
June's HV was more than 6 for first timer. So this central weave was more popular than hv,btohqsg
Amk later all plh in future i think,btohqsg
Aug BTO 2022Tampines application rate 18.5 for 5 room cause too little unitsBukit merah got most applicants  7916 applicants fight for 1298 units. More than 6500 families won‚Äôt be able choose a flat.Let‚Äôs see the application rate for this month BTO. Haha,btohqsg
This is a bit far haha i live in amk all my life,btohqsg
U bought a bto in amk?,btohqsg
Nope  is my grandfather. Kampong time shift here Liao buy for $17.3K,btohqsg
My BTO is at Yishun Beacon,btohqsg
Last sg kampong. Owner refuse to sell at 70mil,btohqsg
Before the current rules  BTO app rates could get veryyy high. On average way higher than now. So there's some upside to the current rules,btohqsg
Smart fella. He should just lease it to the developer and make millions/yr in perpetuity.,btohqsg
True. Lucky her father bought the kampong house for freehold. Can last for generations,btohqsg
Sell le gone le . She needs 70M meh ? No need ma  got $ eat and stay happy liao.,btohqsg
Ya. I see she has a very humbling life. But if people offer 70 billion maybe she might reconsider selling üòÖ,btohqsg
is the upcoming amk bto ideal?,btohqsg
Yes if u have the budget...it good,btohqsg
Everyone have their own preferences as in ‚Äòbetter‚Äô,btohqsg

For me Pasir Ris site 2,btohqsg
Over 2 000 BTO flats with waiting times of under 3 years will be launched in Bukit Batok and Sengkang in October.https://str.sg/FbRd,btohqsg
If u all think u all want waiting times to be shorter then go for this flats on offer during launch . If u all think waiting time not an issue then others,btohqsg
GoodLuck on your BTO Journey on Oct !,btohqsg
Good! Those who BTO in 2022 will collect key later than these owner ü§£,btohqsg
524b mintonia close 2 or 4 room.flat still can get? Even my bto plan to sell once mpo reach next yr,btohqsg
Anyone have champions bliss group chat?,btohqsg
Can we still buy BTO at age after 55?,btohqsg
If u are eligible. Never buy direct from hdb before u consider 1st timer. If u buy before direct from hdb before u consider 2nd timer.U will not be able to buy BTO if u already brought 2 times before,btohqsg
But 1st time is en block. 2nd time bought bto..,btohqsg
is urbanville woodlands still available in sale of balance flats?,btohqsg
Is Yishun Beacon still available in SBF as well?,btohqsg
Sbf in feb next year.. now only once a year. Only will know the offerings then. Depends if people give up their unit,btohqsg
Most units is taken up. Unless u don't mind level 2,btohqsg
If There is sbf u can wait but I'll advise to go for any launch first  not sure Yishun Beacon will still out any sbf or not since this yr no have,btohqsg
Sometimes people back out like financial or breakups. I ever seen post on hwz about many good units in urbanville being offered as sbf. Too bad i couldnt apply then,btohqsg
Location is quite central within Yishun. Very unlikely.,btohqsg
anyone knows the wait time for the upcoming bto houses to be fully built?,btohqsg
Ard 3-4 yrs most of it,btohqsg
Just wondering why such low interest in Geylang are  is it because they have community care apartments?,btohqsg
Quiet doesnt mean low interest. Actual interest level only know during application period,btohqsg
Is there any group for bukit batok oct launch please?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know where these subsidies will be reflected? Is it in terms of the already released prices of the BTO or will it be topped up as additional grants?,btohqsg
Previously PLH is already reflected in sale price - so I suppose it should be the same this time,btohqsg
Is the launch likely to be this week?,btohqsg
Hi all  just curious for the new LTV of 25%  does it mean that we can only take the moderate loan amount stated in HFE? The maximum amount states MSR of 30%  not sure if I‚Äôm mixing it up. Or does it simply mean that down payment is increased from 20% to 25%?,btohqsg
True. Thats why those with bad credit report can still apply hdb loan but not bank loan,btohqsg
I personally kena 1.5 hours waiting time,btohqsg
Bobian Lo  just console myself that that the selection phase is already over lol,btohqsg

Can check what's a good site to filter for HDBs with 5 year MOP?,btohqsg
I use99.coto filter using ‚Äúbuilt year‚Äù,btohqsg
Filter your search > choose HDB > built year state 2019 to get the newest units that just MOP,btohqsg
Thank you! But am particularly looking to filter for flats with 5 year MOp  not just recently MOP,btohqsg
Ya you can choose whichever year you want.. means if you want HDB already MOP for 5 years  just calculate backwards. So can do 2024 - 5 years - 5 years = 2014. So you filter built year > choose 2014,btohqsg
https://www.btohq.com/plh-listFor now only PLH is 10 years MOP  the rest are 5 years MOP. For Oct 2024 BTO  classification of BTO type have to wait for launch,btohqsg
When does HDB normally announce next years launch dates,btohqsg
Depends if HDB is still keeping to 3 BTO launches - if so  can just use this year‚Äôs launch period as the gauge for next year. But no guarantee it‚Äôll be the same. Otherwise will need to wait for HDB to announce.,btohqsg
Those people that submitted HFE before 15 September  did you manage to get approval already?,btohqsg
I only know of BTOHQ - which is the group you are in. As of now  you can go to BTOHQ website and look for Prime Location Housing flats. These are all 10 year MOP. Prior to this up coming Oct launch  any other  flats are all 5 years MOP.Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any other website in particular that tracks BTO data‚Ä¶ but correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.,btohqsg
i just got mine yesterday after 5 weeks' wait. hdb will tell you that you can rest assured you will get your HFE before the oct launch  but best to call and tell them you want to participate in the oct launch,btohqsg

So bto will be launched next week,btohqsg
What's the estimated completion time for each project? Besides only knowing bukit batok will be within 2 years?,btohqsg
Not released yet  only at launch Only bukit batok and sengkang released as within 2 years,btohqsg
May I know if combined income is more than 14k for the couple  they cannot get HFE & apply for the BTO at all?,btohqsg
Can apply for HFE to know your expected loan amount for hdb resale purchase.,btohqsg
"Unlikely  HDB definition of ""waiting time"" refers to when u book your flat to key collection. Booking of flat for this exercise likely is around Q1 2025 earliest. So key collection likely Q1 2027",btohqsg
Ya. Still quicker than feb bto. Which top by q4 2027,btohqsg
Can't apply for BTO with more than 14k combined income,btohqsg
üîë Thinking about owning a home sooner? Start the countdown with us! ‚è≥More than 2 000 flats with wait times of less than three years will be offered in the October BTO exercise. Spread across three projects in Bukit Batok and Sengkang  there is a wide variety of flat types to suit different budgets and needs  ranging from 2-room Flexi units to 3Gen flats.Check out the projects and their nearby amenities.  üçΩüõí,btohqsg
Bukit batok will be hot project,btohqsg
Why? Cus it takes the shortest time to build?,btohqsg
Yes. And quite close to bukit timah. Mrt nearby project too. Nearby princess elizabeth primary and acs,btohqsg
I think the Pasir ris btos are gonna be in such high demand  being standard flats but near an mrt station etc,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt say Feb bto  even quicker than 2020 BTO HAHAHA,btohqsg
I remember yishun Miltonia bto need to wait quite long like 5 yrs?,btohqsg
Those who bto in 2027 will get house earlier than Miltonia BTO,btohqsg
That one. Lol. Take ages üòÖ,btohqsg
Wonder if the quality will be okSuddenly HDB can build BTO in 2 years*in 2024 election year üòù,btohqsg
Wish they could do that to all BTOs Why not they start build then start the launch to have shorter waiting time,btohqsg
Can. Why not. China build 57 storey skyscrapper in 19days. The longer the time the more they relax one. No sense of rush or hustling,btohqsg
I think they also start building already before launch,btohqsg
Is it confirmed that the Pasir Ris project near train station is Standard?,btohqsg
Plus or prime location maybe would be better investment since the amenities are much better,btohqsg
Need to factor in waiting time and mop length as well for investment.,btohqsg
Yeah and also they have grants so hope not so ex  just only need to care about the MOP,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know how much the subsidy clawback for prime and plus flats will be?,btohqsg
The amount will be made known when Plus or Prime projects are launched for sale.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/finding-a-flat/standard-plus-and-prime-housing-models,btohqsg
Any couples here w sch going kidsDo u list ur children as occupiers?If they r sch goingDo u need to upload documents to prove kid is in sch?,btohqsg
If I were to apply for MCPS  what are the information they need from my parents during the BTO application?,btohqsg
Additional documents you need to prepare‚ó¶ Your birth certificate‚ó¶ Your parents‚Äô marriage certificateCan get more detailed info herehttps://www.99.co/singapore/insider/in-depth-guide-hdb-priority-schemes/,btohqsg
Thank you! During the BTO application where I submit my choice of ballot  I only need my parent's NRIC  full name and address right?,btohqsg
From what I understand  yes. And as mentioned above your parents marriage certificate. I am also trying to apply for this haven‚Äôt done so,btohqsg
For plus and prime  it is mentioned that there are more subsidies.. Are these subsidies announced?,btohqsg
I applied for Feb sbf and got called for my selection tmr (out of supply). Tdy I also received an appointment for my June bto application(within supply). Can I skip my sbf appointment and just go for my bto appointment?,btohqsg
U skip means ur next application is Auto cancelled,btohqsg
U get called up means u must go  if less than 10units u try appeal to waived the penalty,btohqsg
Maybe you could check how many more units are left for SBF?,btohqsg
Hopefully less than ten units  then you can appeal to waive the penalty like what Kris says.,btohqsg
All the best for your appointment! Hope you get to select for June bto application,btohqsg
You're lucky to get an appointment for SBF despite out of supply :),btohqsg
The units left all 2nd floor,btohqsg
I see.. how many in total?,btohqsg
hi whats the application date for the october launch? isit not shared yet?,btohqsg
Not shared yet! News say next week,btohqsg
So should be one of the days!,btohqsg
Oh... Today still got selection? Hopefully...,btohqsg
Some ppl select today and it goes less than 10,btohqsg
are there any other documents we need to prepare other than HFE?,btohqsg
Nope  if you're applying for priority schemes,btohqsg
U applying which town for june?,btohqsg
Last sentence is All your ongoing flat application will be cancelled,btohqsg
So don't anyhow don't go when u are invited,btohqsg
still need to go down and inform them / appeal to waive non-selection penalty. cannot no show unless they sms to inform that no need to go down when ethnic quota is full,btohqsg
I see. If i not mistaken only less than 5unit left can appeal for waive if sbf,btohqsg
https://t.me/sghdbsbfGuess u can check here for more details on SBF,btohqsg
still can try luck to appeal. someone who applied chencharu tried getting waiver for earlier bto when left 13units and succeeded.,btohqsg
Hi   regarding payment of new bto flat during key collection day  after emptying cpf  the remaining balance can it be pay by paywave or physical cold hard cash ? Thank you in advance,btohqsg
i've seen people paying by cash before but as i understand HDB prefers NETS. not sure if they accept paynow,btohqsg
I see. Thanks for the reply,btohqsg
paywave unlikely imo cos of CC charges,btohqsg

just sharing: not too long ago my friend wants to put up for new bto (just like you  next year to sell existing bto thst mop in 3-4months next year )  he was told by hdb that he was not eligible to apply for bto.,btohqsg
Hi  how many times Yr friend bought hdb? If bto mop not over yet  hdb won't allow.2. If bought hdb flat 2nd times  have to wait for v100 years then can buy bto.3. Bto is subsidize flat,btohqsg

Because we must wait till MOP then can ballot new bto,btohqsg
I balloted in 2022 for Yishun beacon and was given a que no. Subsequently they canceled my application coz they realized my current flat only MOP in 2024,btohqsg
This applies to resale flat too not only BTO.,btohqsg
How many time u get Yr bto?,btohqsg
If u are 2nd timer   hdb will approve u,btohqsg
Yup they will approve only after the mop period. So my current house was 3.5 yrs then they canceled my application.,btohqsg
So now I'm gg to apply for BTO since it's after the 5 yrs period.,btohqsg

if haven meet MOP how to even apply? I couldnt even get HLE/HFE when my flat not MOP yet,btohqsg
Haven mop can't apply for any.,btohqsg
ya thats why i am curious how you manage to even apply and get the queue number. maybe missed out,btohqsg
This was before they even started the hfe thingy,btohqsg
My que no. Was 33. Was so damn angry,btohqsg
Yishun beacon was oversubscribed then they still cancelled it.,btohqsg
so sad.. 33 is good number,btohqsg
hope u get a decent number this time.. many projects should have higher chance,btohqsg
Hi guys  is there a specific application or process to apply for this additional ballot chance  or is it automatically granted to eligible applicants? (For staying nearing parents),btohqsg
Haven't mop cannot apply new. Example if ur current flat MOP 1 more yrs and this Launch project need to wait 3 yrs u can't take it as still have 3 yrs wait means after my MOP already.,btohqsg
so just to clarify  you‚Äôre currently staying in a BTO  and before your MOP period was up  you applied for a 2nd BTO  intending to sell your 1st BTO   hoping the construction time would overlap with your remaining MOP?,btohqsg
You have to complete MOP first regardless if current flat is BTO or resale. After hit MOP then can apply BTO.,btohqsg
I‚Äôd say the system is working as intended. if you‚Äôve already benefited from subsidies through public housing whether BTO or resale you should rightly be prevented from trying to do so as easily again. this sort of behaviour is exactly what HDB is trying to prevent  so first timers get priority. not sure what ground you‚Äôre standing on to feel any sort of anger against HDB.,btohqsg
need to chose the MCPS scheme during application. not auto. some ppl may not want to use it if parents planning to move out,btohqsg
Current house is resale so we didn't get subsidies back then. So we need a bigger house now due to more children. So I don't see why I can't be angry when my application was cancelled last time. Now fulfilling what they required finally.,btohqsg
You can apply. Only after MOP üòå,btohqsg
And just advising the person who asked earlier on why they can't apply bto when current flat haven mop. Not here to debate what kind of behaviour can apply bto or not.,btohqsg
Hi  which area? Your application rejected? Pm me . I suggest you see your MP for appeal if is rejected,btohqsg
Thanks  we went it didn't help too. Anw it was over for so long. Back in 2022. No more units left for us to choose anymore. Haaha.,btohqsg
How many times u apply Yr bto?,btohqsg
Just curious  are u considered first timer when applying for bto since u say the current unit no grant.,btohqsg
The maximum amount of HDB resale grants you can get is S$230 000. With the three main grants ‚Äî Family Grant  EHG and PHG ‚Äî available for resale flats  you may be eligible to receive a total of S$230 000.I check tru Google,btohqsg
You‚Äôre considered first timer if you‚Äôve never bought a flat before. If you buy resale  den will be considered 2nd timer,btohqsg
Back then resale got no subsidies or u choose not to take subsidies? Just curious,btohqsg
Fyi  By not using the grant for resale   even if you are entitled to it  you retain your first-time home buyer eligibility status for the future,btohqsg
Ok  were u not aware that your resale flat need to stay 5 yrs before balloting for new bto? Hence you were angry later that hdb cancelled your number,btohqsg
Hi  have they released the application for October BTO ?,btohqsg
Agree  just dont understand how hdb allowed it to happen  considered major lapse,btohqsg
So u bought ur resale without grant is it?,btohqsg
True. Its hdb fault. Back then maybe the system wasnt that advance. Now u cant even ballot if ur still under mop or receive que number within supply,btohqsg
Divorced senior wanna buy 2 room flexi  previous 3 room not sold and owned by ex spouse. Need to pay resale levy?,btohqsg
If the flat still under mop   means mop hasn't over yet   is the law u can't buy another flat. Is not hdb fault.,btohqsg
Two room studio like no need pay levy for previous flat  but I heard hmm need pay about 10k+- on top new flat price. Heard other seniors said  I not sure.,btohqsg
Hmm  I heard no need leh. Agent also say no need  but if the studio is 3rd attempt new flat  many senior say need pay about 10+k on top of the new flat cost. In this case  I not sure  best to check with hdb,btohqsg
I said its the system fault. The system not made by hdb meh? Lol,btohqsg
Anyone know how to see the next week bto is prime or prime plus location? Or have to wait for next week then know? Thanks.,btohqsg

hi i was shocked hdb cancel my June 24 bto for no reason. I went to HDB website under my profile and I saw. Was shocked to see. Can they just cancel without notifying me?,btohqsg
Nope  I gotten queue number but haven't been called up to choose unit,btohqsg
I don't understand why they cancel my application since already got queue number (within supply),btohqsg
I tried calling mainline but automated voice msg. Only open Mon-Fri during office hrs,btohqsg
I fulfilled MOP of 5yrs for my bto.  Jun 24 bto public queue starting 14 Oct,btohqsg
So not due to units all taken up,btohqsg
Does HDB have the right to just cancel my bto application without informing me even i have queue number (within supply)?,btohqsg
Hdb can check your history into their system. Hdb have the right. U can go down to check with the officer inchargd of Yr case. Call that officer if the letter got state their direct number,btohqsg
Ic  but not informing me of the reason is not acceptable. At the very least let me know why,btohqsg
What do you see in the hdb portal now?,btohqsg
If u click the red button on the right   no additional details?sorry I am not sure about your situation but  I believe HDB should be transparent about the cancellation,btohqsg
That's what i feel too. Hopefully it's technical or human error.,btohqsg
Yeah hope u get clarity on monday,btohqsg
Will try to log in again to see if there's any changes,btohqsg
Check your email or junk box,btohqsg
Checked. So far no email from HDB,btohqsg
Yea will keep checking. Maybe will send during weekdays?,btohqsg
U login at 12am check again if is glitch,btohqsg
Or u may check w the BTO group did anyone same launch face the same issue?,btohqsg
I posted already. So far nobody have same issue,btohqsg
Hopefully its system glitch or human error,btohqsg
Maybe TMR U call hdb and ask.,btohqsg
Yes that's the only way. Wanted to go down HDB but don't know can allow walk in.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think they entertain walk in enquiries. Best to write in or call them at 18008663066,btohqsg
Already write to them. Will call them tmr. Thanks for the contact number,btohqsg
Hi! If I apply under MCPS (first timer) and I managed to get queue number  how do I know if I got the queue number via MCPS priority scheme or first timer public scheme?,btohqsg
doesnt matter how u got it because mcps just give you extra ballot  so no difference ba,btohqsg
means normal ballot is 1  first timer +1 ballot  mcps +1 ballot.u total got 3 ballot chances with mcps,btohqsg
but if u apply with mcps and got queue number  u'll be categorised under mcps alr (correct me if im wrong anyone),btohqsg
If your queue number was due to mcps then you will be categorised under it. You‚Äôll only know when you receive the application package and see the Undertaking of MCPS form which the parents need to sign.,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong  you will ballot under the pool of mcps first  then if you didn't get  you will ballot under the pool of first timer (no priority scheme).,btohqsg
I see I see  I get it now! Thanks,btohqsg
Btw do note that they will give you the best outcome.,btohqsg
I was wondering just now if I get my number due to the first timer public scheme  will I still be categorised under mcps . But you answered my question!,btohqsg
Like the one that have the best queue number? Okok,btohqsg
When will I receive application package?,btohqsg
Is it before the first appointment?,btohqsg
2 weeks before your selection date,btohqsg
Hi just to ask anyone know if TMR the launch for Oct launch will start ?,btohqsg
You can subscribe to hdb newsletter and email alert to inform you any new BTO/SBF launch.Normally  you will know any launch faster via this telegram group or news report. Haha.,btohqsg
For the June 2024 BTO  the launch was in the evening around 5 pm if I remembered correctly.,btohqsg
Did u appeal anything  etc resale levy  or loan whatever when you Got the Q number?,btohqsg
So now here also can advertise?,btohqsg
No leh.. i remember clearly its in the morning as i was outside when launch,btohqsg
You are right. I remembered by evening time  the application rate status was updated with numbers.,btohqsg
Hopefully the bto exercise opens today,btohqsg
Check hdb website for bto execrise,btohqsg
Hi  Is there a chatgroup for Kent Heights residents?,btohqsg

More of want to get more info.. and monitor application rate,btohqsg
May I know how accurate is the data shown on the website?Sorry in advance if this is a stupid question,btohqsg
i guess its the application rate on hdb website.. it should be quite accurate since its from hdb,btohqsg
First the MRT  now the BTO  Its so over,btohqsg
Curious  did HDB tell u why it was cancelled?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know when Champions Bliss key collection will be?,btohqsg

Hi just to clarify  will the x% subsidy clawback by on resale price of the unit? Or will be on the grants provided?,btohqsg
Hello! Is there already info on how many floors each project has for Oct launch? Thanks!,btohqsg
Anybody know about this? Did they change to not able to apply a certain project?,btohqsg
Hi just to ask how long after applying will it take to be able to book the flat,btohqsg
They combine the area project tgt,btohqsg
hi  can i check around when will sbf projects be released for our consideration? (since feb 2025 bto projects out ler),btohqsg
Mean cannot choose without the project ah,btohqsg
hi  wanna check  if i want to reassess my loan before the project is ready  will it affect my EHG?,btohqsg
Cannot  have to ballot when u got q number then can choose when its ur turn,btohqsg
Depends on queue number too but minimumly 2 months i think,btohqsg
more than that la.. they only issue queue number around 2months. after that wait till they schedule appointment,btohqsg
So just pray the q number u get is as low as possible so u can choose the projevt u want?,btohqsg
Will they allocate which project u got for u?,btohqsg
Not really but ur queue number plays a huge part,btohqsg
No depends which flat left on any project when its ur turn,btohqsg
Oh okay thanks . Cause my first time applying.  But if I put my child as a priority. Is there higher chance to flat booking .,btohqsg
Ok thanks man . Anyway Goodluck guys,btohqsg
Im married with a child but my sister not yet married . She gets a Q number faster than me .,btohqsg
So everything is luck one . If is yours is yours,btohqsg
I see . So it's after the balloting then got queue number right,btohqsg
yes la.. the actual queue number will be sent to applicant around 2 months after closing date,btohqsg
If we dont get a queue number would we be notified too?,btohqsg
near the date will have people reporting about missing profile pic.. you get to that nearer the date,btohqsg
this round it is unlikely not to get a queue number since there are so many projects and the highest number of units.. its more of getting queue number within supply and a good number to chose good units,btohqsg
hdb issues 3x queue number in anticipation of dropouts,btohqsg
Pasir Ris 5 rm isit overprice?,btohqsg
Hope I can get to book for the flat because my only 88 units,btohqsg
its 5yrs Standard.. so expect to pay more for the amenities and mrt + seaview,btohqsg
Can I check any additional subsidies for plus projects? Apart from the existing grants,btohqsg
Itll be a percentage of the resale or valuation price (whichever higher!),btohqsg
Does anyone know if I apply for deferred payment scheme am I still entitled for ehg or any grants?,btohqsg
hi can i check if the prices for the btos shown are before or after subsidies?,btohqsg
I believe so  the deferred payment should be separate from the grants eligibility,btohqsg
May i know the expected completion date for the bto houses,btohqsg
Can check the project page links  under est waiting time  look at the ? They will state ECD eg this is Pasir Ris one  q3 2028,btohqsg
this kind of combined BTO is quite dangerous  unless you really ok with all 3 projects.I applied for Queenstown bundled project  queue number 2.8k+  took almost a year for them to call me up and by then  I already applied for 2 other projects and got a better queue number.Now with the new changes  you can't even get another queue number if you are within quota.,btohqsg
Wow the clawback is very high,btohqsg
Anyone know where can I check the bto price? Thank you üôèüèº,btohqsg
Can I check if the selling price including grants applies to everyone or it‚Äôs dependent on the grant amount that‚Äôs given by HDB?,btohqsg
You should look at excluding grants then subtract the amount of grants given to you.The including grants price uses the highest grants which won‚Äôt be accurate unless you are getting the highest grant,btohqsg
