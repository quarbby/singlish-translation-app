Why u have $200k in the account? If u did not empty the account by 30 Dec  and had $100k in it  then not worth to do the rising dragon promo on the account already. Can do it on another UOB account like Stash or wait for the next promo (if any),btohqsg
Hi all So any good alternative bank account suggestions for move UOB funds  to another bank ?Like what I found is :GXS for 100000 daily limitAnd Mari bank for 75000,btohqsg
For card sign up bonuses that says first xxx will get the bonus. Is there a way to know if we fall within that bracket?Example first 200 for uob lady's card.,btohqsg
nope  can only hope and pray,btohqsg
You submit exactly 1 second after the start date and time most likely fall within. 🙃,btohqsg
Stash would be a good option. Just empty it until promo comes. You can earn 3% plus $588 with $100k,btohqsg
Hi  I realized that I can top up youtrip with Mastercard with no fees. Is it possible to also top up wise and amaze with credit card with no fee as well?,btohqsg
U can top up amaze wallet free with mastercard,btohqsg
To earn the monthly interest in other account  I presume we only transfer back 100k to uob on 1/5. This means we lose the 5% uob interest for April right,btohqsg
Anyone invest in unit trust to get the extra interest in ocbc or sc? Is it worth to do so?,btohqsg
Yeah correct that’s why we need to move funds for 4 days28  29 30 31 then on 1st April can transfer back to UOB one,btohqsg
I nv invest with banks before. But a quick Google shows bank fees charge in range of 1-3% in interest. The extra 1.5% they give u on whatever amount u have in ur 360acct  might just cover it  have to do the math,btohqsg
I saw the sales charges was 0.8% - 0.88% if buy via online banking. So was thinking anyone try before or there is some hidden fees.,btohqsg
Can confirm if I use Citi rewards card link for Grab rides  eligible for credit card rewards?,btohqsg
Hi hi  anyone know if UPS courier  for parcel import duty  can pay them by credit card?,btohqsg

The last I did my research  HSBC revolution seems to be the best entry level miles card. Seeking for opinions 🙂,btohqsg
You transfer out late on the previous month  and transfer in early the next month. If you plan it correctly you won’t lose the 5% interest for either month,btohqsg
Yes correct  it’s a whitelist card,btohqsg
A couple of other great options depending on your spending patterns:* CRMC+Amaze* UOB PPV,btohqsg
Ooo ok! Thank you  let me check it out :),btohqsg

Hi everyone  may I ask for those who have tried and moomoo 6.8% promo...I can only move my funds on 1st April so.. should I open the account now then only do all the necessary subscription and fund transfer to 1st April morning/afternoon? Do you think I will be able to finish it in time? Any possible hiccups to accomplish it on this promo last day?,btohqsg
why on 1st April? 1st April is the last day for current promo,btohqsg
Will I get CC rewards if I use HSBC revolution card for Scoot flight booking?,btohqsg
Check if anyone knowsI have cancelled my hsbc card last Aug. When can I re-sign again as new card member? 6 months or 1 year,btohqsg
Because I am emptying out my other bank acct. And withdrawal on that account in March will result in forfeiting of March's interest,btohqsg
Wdym forfeiting march interest? Your EDB will still get you the base interest  at most it's the MAB affecting bonus interest.,btohqsg
"Nope. It's the ocbc premier acct. It had the criteria of ""Cannot do any withdrawal at all""",btohqsg
anyone managed to topup their snack account? mine kept showing an error msg,btohqsg
Can ask if anyone uses ocbc robo invest?,btohqsg
Yes if you buy directly from Scoot is under whitelisted MCC,btohqsg
Hi guys! May I check if you guys know of any other platforms that can see the price movement in a more reactive way  cause yahoo finance show a delayed price action,btohqsg
If it's a fairly mainstream index you can probably find it on tradingview,btohqsg
Has anyone use maybank horizon Visa card to make ‘snack by income ‘payments and convert to miles(maybank treat points )?,btohqsg

If you sign up credit card on singsaver  will you get the singsaver promo item + the bank’s promo item? Or just singsaver?,btohqsg
Usually not stackable. But should read the exact t&c  or ask the bank to be sure,btohqsg
Owww. For moomoo the up to 200k 6.8% promo is only for existing customers? 😔,btohqsg
May I ask what shd a new user to moomoo participate in?,btohqsg
Just a shout out again  buying in capitaland evoucher from keen seller for my friend  not at face value. Dm me your discount and amt you are selling  dont ask me what i offer. Just tell me your offer.,btohqsg
Same here. Buying capitalaland evoucher.Pls quote me too,btohqsg
I think it’s better if u mention what is the price u are offering for CapitaStar e vouchers.If it’s a fair deal  I’m sure many will be willing to sell.Otherwise it seems like the aim is to attract unknowing sellers to sell at lousy prices because they don’t have enough info (and the buyer knows the seller got the vouchers free from snack promo).,btohqsg
if you're looking to do the 6.8% as a new user  you can deposit up to 60k for the 6.8%. but if you're also looking to optimize sign up rewards  you can deposit up to 100k to get $880 in terms of stock rewards. if im not wrong  putting 100k should still allow you to get 6.8% returns on 60k and remaining 40k will get Fullerton SGD returns (last i checked was ~3.7-3.8%),btohqsg
