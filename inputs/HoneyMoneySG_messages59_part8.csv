Moomoo cashplus interest rate is how much,btohqsg
If other can comment where you are looking to move.. ?,btohqsg
this rate is not fixed right,btohqsg
Fluctuates from day to day  it‚Äôs a fund after all. Sum not insured as well.,btohqsg
But this cash plus account doesn‚Äôt guarantee the capital sum right ?,btohqsg
Sians for GXS. I just on board not long ago,btohqsg
Not a single cent is insured,btohqsg

What other options are good ? Apart from uob or sc,btohqsg
Cimb is increment only so one month park there another month move back gxs,btohqsg
is not. ref month is July,btohqsg
Later all the money will be move out from GXS,btohqsg
Is there any CC that's good for insurance premiums with air miles or rebate?,btohqsg
I July move my cash to gxs so my cimb no increment liao lo,btohqsg
bingo. I wonder how they're gonna fund their loans now,btohqsg
Aha  at the ntuc fairprice? Do they take kris +?,btohqsg
Maybank VI if you qualify. Otherwise UOB Absolute or Amex TCB if they accept Amex,btohqsg
Nid maintenance just park gxs sua,btohqsg
eh I ask you. did you have any money in your CIMB account on 31 July?,btohqsg
Can only pay with krispay miles,btohqsg
Oh u pay with miles. I wouldn't use my precious miles at ntuc üòÇ,btohqsg
Just saw horizon have also. Note sure if it's correct,btohqsg
I move out cash at late july,btohqsg
oh ok then no have...because the reference is based on end of day balance on 31 July. so if you have money at EOD of 31 July then you subtract that amount to calculate the 3.5% interest rate,btohqsg
Krispay mile earn from bonus cant be transfer to krisflyer  only base miles can. So i just redeem to ntuc when there is miles bacl promo  if not those miles expire is 6 month i think,btohqsg
late July meaning  on 31 July EOD  you got money inside CIMB? If your CIMB account balance was $0 as of 31 July  then you can take advantage of the CIMB promo,btohqsg
Anyone find it odd that they are taking EOD 31 July as reference instead of July ADB.,btohqsg
why not. it's their prerogative as to how they want to run their promo,btohqsg
End of July I gt around 2k,btohqsg
anyone know for moomoo if you transfer USD back to bank  will bank charge the $10 fee for foreign currency fee thingy,btohqsg
Just concerned it might be a wording mistake in the t&c.,btohqsg
What happen to the amount at 31 July base interest,btohqsg
so basically first 2k earns 1.5%  any incremental amount earns 3.5%. still a good deal,btohqsg
Until Dec right this promo ref all the way at 31july,btohqsg
Just take it as 2.5k around there for me,btohqsg
Until Jan 2024 if not wrong,btohqsg
Lol dam it if I know i left it zero,btohqsg
1st aug 2023 to 31st Jan 2024,btohqsg
But so far how‚Äôs the performance of it? Is the capital fund value maintained?,btohqsg
Hi guys  assuming I opted for  travel category for UOB LAdys. If I pay say agoda using Amaze stacked with UOB Lady's  I will still earn 6mpd right as its part of my category?,btohqsg
For the moomoo 5.8% once i reached 30 days  i cant restart this promo again?,btohqsg
Now that gxs chut pattern...wonder whats the best way to maximise the money,btohqsg
Cimb 3.5% for 6mths seems to be the best option once you have maxed out uob if you don't want fixed d,btohqsg
Haha was talking to my colleagues whether halfway they‚Äôll change int rates cos they hit quota liao then rly drop wth lol,btohqsg
Personally  i expected this move to come. Just not so fast,btohqsg
oh yam just saw the email notification too. Good times don't last.They cannot get hold of enough lending base to offset the deposit rates,btohqsg
"From POEMS T&C""However  to be eligible for the promotion  only the net balance of deposits at the end of each day of the 30-day period will be calculated for the 5.8% p.a. returns.""Meaning just park 50K in the end of August to get the 5.8%??",btohqsg
Agreed make full used of it before it game over,btohqsg
Thank you!Unfortunately 4812 isn't in their whitelist.,btohqsg
The last possible one that I know of is UOB Krisflyer.But one has to spend minimum SGD $800 at SQ/scoot/Kris shop first.Before all the transaction can automatically earn 3mpd,btohqsg
