If I am not wrong the relatives tried to push the responsibility of taking care of my grandma to my dad when they are clearly in a better financial position to take care of her,btohqsg
To tell you all my parents married without support from grandma,btohqsg
Oh dear  hope all is well,btohqsg
Family disputes regarding money have became increasingly frequent the past few years - numerous examples from Straits Times on changing the will of the deceased  etc,btohqsg
So whether I should have any feelings for grandma is debatable uh,btohqsg
Today's CNY eve  so mostly only reunion dinner,btohqsg
My parents married with friends serving as official witnesses at ROM,btohqsg
Lol so I think it make sense I totally don't feel anything for grandma that is,btohqsg
About that ... it was even worse these days uh especially when some ppl get into sham marriages to either help someone else for money or hide their sexual orientation,btohqsg
I was on r/sgexams some gay dude asking if can marrying lesbian to get bto flat and hide his gay orientation,btohqsg
I had to explain the legal implications,btohqsg
He was too simple minded thinking is just a simple process   marriages assumes many things uh like determine asset allocation post death and the so-called official wife might have legal rights to challenge the written will,btohqsg
I explained to him and he gave up the idea basically to prevent this messy chaos later on. I am tolerant towards lgbt community too.,btohqsg
Just be straight can already. No such problems,btohqsg

So I don't quite bother   my parents practically pay zero attention to my relationship matters,btohqsg
Hahaha - anyone who wants a partner should go and put themselves out in the open. They should also have whatever qualities they want in their partner  as psychology proves people who look like each other somehow has higher likelihood of getting together,btohqsg

Haha not like it will make a difference,btohqsg
