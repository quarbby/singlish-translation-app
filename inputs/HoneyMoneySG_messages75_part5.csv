Hi sorry dumb question. For sc credit card  which amount should I pay?,btohqsg
Did you make some payments beforehand or were there cashbacks awarded?You should pay the  total outstanding balance. I believe there was some payments that offset the balance due.,btohqsg

Make payment according to your outstanding balance then.,btohqsg
Ok thanks! Anw do u know if we pay the bill  we don‚Äôt receive notification or anything? üòÖ,btohqsg
Anyone here with SCB can help please?I haven‚Äôt used SCB but the app should adjust the amount to zero or whatever balance is left  according to your payment. On top of that  there should be an sms notification that payment is successful.,btohqsg
U click the card display  it should toggle between due balance n outstanding balance..Payable is due balance.. outstanding may not be due yet... but ya if ur credit cash back makes the outstanding lesser than due  then I will pay the outstanding amount. .,btohqsg

Generation Z have never ÂêÉËã¶  most are born with silver spoon eat well sleep well  well taken care. Most are still schooling  their mindset not yet mature so its too early to talk about retirement. üòÇBetter to ask Millennials instead on when they want to retire.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a millennial and aiming to retire at 40  but i think the more important question is the why  not when. That‚Äôs why I asked Mr/Mrs K above  what‚Äôs the definition of retirement? I wish I knew about the possibilities of early retirement when I was Gen Z‚Äôs age. Why talking about retirement got age threshold? I thought the earlier the better? üòÇ,btohqsg
