Crude Oily🛢️ WTIrose above $91 per barrel on Monday  hovering at the highest levels in over ten months amid expectations of a widening market deficit in the fourth quarter due to extended supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia  as well as hopes of a demand recovery in China. OPEC  the US Energy Information Administration and the International Energy Agency all predicted larger market deficits in the next quarter as major producers kept global supplies tight  with global oil demand growth also expected to rise in the same period. Fresh stimulus measures from Beijing and increased output from Chinese refiners driven by strong export margins also supported the demand outlook in the world’s top crude importer.,btohqsg
