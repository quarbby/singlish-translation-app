anyone can advice what card good for education transaction or tuition?i use uob one but not included,btohqsg
Not needed. If new user  will get a fresh 5.8% for any amount.,btohqsg
maybank cards. do a search onheymax.ai,btohqsg
I can just subcribe into Fullerton cash fund   after 30days the 5.8% will go into the moomoo wallet?,btohqsg
Newbie to investing  sorry to ask so noob questions,btohqsg
Check ur moomoo  under promotions tab  there should be a 5.8% banner for cash funds. Suggest u subscribe through the banner to ensure u get the 5.8%,btohqsg
Hi  sorry I tried a rolling through but can find an answer.For UOB One account. To fulfill $500 min spent  can this amount be combine usage of two UOB eligible credit cards? E.g. UOB One (for petrol) and UOB Evol?Thanks!,btohqsg
yes if the credit card is eligiible for UOB One spendingsUOB One account should have the T&C,btohqsg
Because the mandatory contribution cap is still the same 37740  this would only means one would reach this amount earlier right? Example if someone get 4 mth bonus 6800x12+4x0.37 is $40256   so 3k will be refunded right,btohqsg
Yes thank you. Anyone if lock up money still able to get the bonua interest?,btohqsg
Hi all  did anyone receive email confirmation regarding successful application of UOB Xmas promotion? I called UOB and they said they didnt receive my application and said that there would be email comfirmation receipt. i didnt receive the email confirmation but i see a confirmation page but i didnt screenshot the confirmation page.Im not referring to the account opening. Im referring to the additional promo after the acc opening like giro crediting that needs to sign up on the uob wesiteThanks all,btohqsg
do you guys ever use citibank rewards card when linked or just use amaze since you get instapoint?,btohqsg
You can see the interest rates for lockaway account in the same exact website.,btohqsg
VCMA cap is BHS. Not affected by annual CPF contribution cap.,btohqsg
And when i called uob  they said they didnt receive my application for the additional bonus  even my acc opening on every friday promo... now they are asking me to send ss for proof...Usually how long does it take for the acc opening bonus money to be credited?,btohqsg
If you search the chat  many are using Amaze+CRMC combo.,btohqsg
Most ppl will use Amaze+crmc as Amaze converts offline to online  can get 10x points so long mcc not excluded.,btohqsg
so for purchases  just use the amaze card after linking im assuming,btohqsg
Hi all  I am going to sign up a gym package with Amore fitness but unsure what miles card to use. Not sure if the mcc is 7298 or 7997? Thanks!,btohqsg
Cannot find Amore fitness in heymax,btohqsg
thanks! any idea if using amaze will qualify as eligible spend for the singsaver promo to hit min spend?,btohqsg
Note that instapoints only awarded for non-excluded MCCs when paying in FCY.Also note that travel MCCs are excluded from 10x reward points(And to answer your question above on promo: yes),btohqsg
Would favepay + dbs WWMC give 10x points for eligible MCCs?,btohqsg
Ps wrong not vcma but mandatory contribution,btohqsg
Is there any other way of converting sgqr to online spend for wwmc?,btohqsg
Then to answer your question  yes. But you still can VCMA 8k to self if you haven't reach BHS to get tax relief.,btohqsg
If the merchant has XNAP on their SGQR  then you can use XNAP to pay under online spend.,btohqsg
shopback  xnap  Kris+ ok  just not favepay which is explicitly excluded,btohqsg
Sorry stupid question  is Amore Define same as Amore Fitness?,btohqsg
How to make money working from home ?,btohqsg
Get a job that allows you to work from home ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
Can find a job that offers WFH,btohqsg
hi  can I as a first jobber apply UOB lady's card then call UOB to upgrade to solitaire? Since I saw someone mentioned before that it was possible to call to upgrade..?,btohqsg
Hi  if I am using Citi Cashback+ with M1 recurring payment. Do I get cashback?,btohqsg
Case by case. Still need to see records and income.,btohqsg
If it's not in exclusion then it's qualified for cashback.,btohqsg
Okay thanks a lot. Will try for a month see if I get cashback afterwards,btohqsg
But the insurance of the company itself do not accept cc payment  only paynow.Based on yr message  I thought can use cc thru uob app to pay the insurance.,btohqsg
No  he meant paying through the insurance company's app,btohqsg
That's not my message. My message is just pay cc to clock $500 cc spend for UOB One account.,btohqsg
Hi anyone able to enlighten how long will it take to process and approve CDP account   applied using singpass ?,btohqsg
Should be a few days to a week iirc,btohqsg
If I link amaze to uob evol does it covert to online transaction even if i tap the amaze card?,btohqsg
Amaze can only link to Mastercard.,btohqsg
I see  anyway to fulfil the online spend category on dining at restaurants? Maybe like shopback or favepay?,btohqsg
Ya shopback/fave/kris+ all should work. a lot of restaurants do QR code too  scan and order at the table.,btohqsg
To add on for QR code in restaurant is scan  order and PAY on your phone. Not scan and order then pay at counter.Order and pay on McDonald's app  KFC app.,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask for the qualifying 500 spend for ocbc 360  I only have ocbc titanium card  can it be anything other things like dining or petrol or bills instead of retail stuff?,btohqsg
Can but if you donâ€™t spend on the whitelisted merchants/mccs you get only 0.4mpd instead of 4mpd.,btohqsg
Tks for the reply. Utilities bill  season parking  telephone bills qualify for the 500 min spend criteria? Cos I don't spend so much on retail stuff every mth.,btohqsg
