Yeah. Am still deciding between using FSMOne or IBKR.IBKR is 0.05%   min USD1.70 for both buy and sell CSPX. Means total is 0.10 for 1 time of buy and sell versus FSMOne 0.15 for 1 time of buy and sell. And I heard FX on IBKR is better,btohqsg
yes IBKR is better overall. I may start in IBKR if FSMONE stops the 'promotion',btohqsg
Also minimum GBP 15 when sell means need to sell at least GBP 10 000 worth of CSPX to have a fee of 0.15%,btohqsg
well we will DCA into it  so we can reach that amount in the future.,btohqsg
Yeah. Means got to DCA out in larger amounts when need to have the funds.,btohqsg

Is there any folk here familiar with ntuc income insurance policy? My parent bought some policy and premium seems costly  wish to have it clarified without agenda. Appreciate if any takers can help.,btohqsg
Maybe you can just drop the name of the policy?,btohqsg
Isn't this the normal hospitalisation plan + the rider to reduce co-payment to 5%? ðŸ˜…I would suppose your parent included cancer drug treatment one? If it's higher premium than normal.,btohqsg
Hospital plan premium will get more costly when insured get older. My dad is 74  he pay ard 7k per year for income hospital plan,btohqsg

Hi everyone  I'm currently looking into getting citi rewards card + amaze card. I understand with this link up  I can get 4mpd. My question is  does this apply to all transaction for as long as I use my amaze card?Ps  I understand there's a cap of $1000 to get the 4mpd. Anything after will be 0.4mpd.,btohqsg
Thanks in advance guys  I'm really new in the credit card worldðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
In short  my monthly spending is estimated 1.5k-2k. My motive of getting a card is to earn miles and exchange it for a flight ticket(almost every year  i fly back to Malaysia during cny),btohqsg
