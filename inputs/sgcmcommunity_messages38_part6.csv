If all 4 full  must return somewhere else,btohqsg
But the insurance issue is real with bluesg  excess super high,btohqsg
Have a few cases where the car broke down and the hirer had to pay around 4k in repairs because being driven by them when it broke down,btohqsg
I prefer to Spend the money on home hifi more better. We spend more time at home than in car anyway,btohqsg
Whoever that was.. “c*ck” is a banned word here sir,btohqsg
WDFish 8K self and 8K 3rd Party?!,btohqsg
finally you avoided the banned words ah,btohqsg
i think their insurance $50/yr only lolol,btohqsg
I dont think the car is even worth 16K,btohqsg
heng my time on bluesg bo taiji... know liao kakin cancel acct,btohqsg
Their car is BYD. Build your dreamShld change to SYD.Shatter Your Dreams 😂,btohqsg
That’s absurd. Why should consumers bear the maintenance risk on such short term rentals.,btohqsg
It’s the car they bang into:)) and yes I think 小蓝should be worth less than 16k,btohqsg
Outside of normal wear and tear norms. Unless of coz it’s proven the damage was caused by the hirer’s misuse or abuse.,btohqsg
Think of it. In my HDB carpark  I have a neighbour car whose number plate is definitely worth more than the car 😂,btohqsg
I think just insure for the paper only at this point  16k more than enough to cover most fender benders with these cars,btohqsg
Number plate those e/s series driving b&b cars,btohqsg
It is a S series plate with 2 digits  on a Mazda 3 😂,btohqsg
I thinking is it they not so rich,btohqsg
I KNEW THESE COMMENTS ARE COMING WHEN SOMEONE MENTION MAZDA 😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
I heard they from same family tree,btohqsg
Coukd be possible that the plate has been in the family for a while. Sometimes some people do spend an amount on plates disproportionate to their car as well just because they want to have that good looking plate,btohqsg
I thought Mr Xun no friends staying in hdb? All gcb already right?,btohqsg
Can give me class 2 instantly?,btohqsg
But many nice plates on conti too,btohqsg
They have much better insurance than blue sg,btohqsg
He very clever de.. never mention about rich relatives.,btohqsg
Carclub and tribecars alr partner tgt,btohqsg
How much for class 3 and class 2 ah Mr Kelvin,btohqsg

Maintenance to be covered all under the rental charge.,btohqsg
Gone liaoThey are damn good as you can rent from A and return at B,btohqsg
Looks like my very generous offer is better. Don’t worry can share with you. 😁,btohqsg
Used to rent once. They had a special key to unlock the car,btohqsg
Is it true that you cannot update your OS? Heard before that once updated to certain version  old phone cannot work anymore,btohqsg
Tribe car too over their fleet or cars?,btohqsg
Yeah. Hopefully  those owned such loud car be considerate and ramp cars in the day time and no one will cow peh! Ramp loud cars at wee hours are just outrageously uncouth and  reflect poor  judgement of their social civic mindedness.,btohqsg
True from Iphone 7 or 8 onwards  when they started to bind part serial numbers in the firmware.No such thing for iphones with headphone jacks. As such  that phone is a heaven for me.,btohqsg
No matter how loud one’s car is  it is possible to gentle drive at Low revs and higher gears,btohqsg
Damn my iPhone 7..... Still using but don't dare to update,btohqsg
Tribecar economy cars are basically EX Grab cars with 1 or 2 years COE left. Not sure if it is true now.I enjoy Smove's Prius C,btohqsg

Might have been better if i slept in ur rickshaw,btohqsg
