Hi all  I had been paying MyRepublic with WWMC and not getting the bonus points. CSO said its becaused it was tagged to MCC 4814 and its excluded. Dont recall seeing WWMC T&C excluding 4814 though. Any one faced the same issue?,btohqsg

Btw SC  does the Cashback Cap apply? I got the promo cashback from SC CC application like 4 to 5 years ago.,btohqsg
Singsaver new offer is fine as long as you did not hold the card for past 12 months,btohqsg
for ocbc can apply card only without account?,btohqsg
more likely no bonus points because not online. Check the payment mode stated for the transaction,btohqsg
How long after we cancel the credit card  we are allowed to do this kind of promo from singsaver again?,btohqsg
Its online though  I just add the card to the myrepublic page for deduction,btohqsg
auto deduction may not be processed as online ah,btohqsg
One time payment should be online. If recurring most likely not.,btohqsg
I see  but myrepublic got no option of a one time paymenet. Only just adding the card there for it to deduct. Anyone knows a way to get around this? I know singtel can do one time payment and non recurring,btohqsg
From My Republic website after a Google search,btohqsg
Thanks! I see its through the app  usually i do it via the web. Will look into this!,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I hope to keep up to date with u all. Is youtrip card not the best overseas card to use? Should use amaze with citibank?,btohqsg
Amaze exchange rate is bad but if you don‚Äôt mind it and just want to earn miles  then it‚Äôs ok. I usually pair it with either uob solitaire or Citibank rewards,btohqsg
This is not your account right?@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg

Hey all  anyone know if use Citi SMRT card to pay for taobao app shopping is consider 5% rebate? I searched through online and also on this chat but no conclusion to this and I also spoke to Citi CS but they only tell me if it has online indicator then there will be 5%. She also said this indicator is determined by system indicators reflecting if it's an online transaction processed by respective merchants/acquirers through Visa/Mastercard networks so Citibank will not know until the transaction is posted. So basically no conclusion again  so if anyone have used before and get 5% rebate do let me know. Thank you so much.,btohqsg
Lol I don't think anyone would actually pm him right,btohqsg
For UOB One Account I signed up for the Xmas promo and there's a $550 credit for 4 months of lock in from Jan 2024. Do I still be able to enjoy the EIR of 5%? I had $100K locked in. Thank you.,btohqsg
