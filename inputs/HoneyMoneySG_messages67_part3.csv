Hi all  any idea when we would get the extra US$30 Tesla shares for signing up for Tiger brokers using the Honey money link? Thanks,btohqsg
Likely not  Singapore’s status as a safe haven is gaining traction …,btohqsg
Turning 18 in a few days  any tips on investing ? In SGX and foreign investments ? Current goal is to build and maintain wealth  I’m open to take risks along the way,btohqsg
Furthermore  the rate of change of short term interest rates is slowing down  in line with the Fed’s dot plots. Higher for longer  hence range bound around this level is the likely outcome  my view only,btohqsg
No tips  read more before starting your investment. There’s a lot of information out there.US is still the best  you can try SGX but I’m not well versed on it. Some people Huat buying SGX  but I don’t think it’s easy.Objectively  US is larger  more liquidity  well diversified and it also covered all the sectors,btohqsg
Hi  I am trying to hit UOB eligible spends. On my credit card bill  some transactions have the description NET*(Food vendor name). It was a credit card transaction  anyone knows what does NET* mean and if it is an eligible transaction.,btohqsg
no need care too much about NET* transactions  these are eligible so long MCC not excluded,btohqsg
there were rumours previously that NETS* transactions might be excluded.For me  I always play safe and exclude NETS* transactions from tabulation for cards that have minimum spending requirements. Not worth the grief losing all your cashback just for those suspicious transactions,btohqsg
Any comments on new Mari invest   average 3.6% return   no lock down period   without anytime,btohqsg

Must be from one of the chat groups.And I think some card tncs really did spell out exclusions likeAmaze*Net*,btohqsg
Anyone can give a infographic of all these rich and valuable information of latest credit cards. Then most of us can optimise it.,btohqsg
Is there a min spend for uob lady to get 6mpd? Assuming the right category,btohqsg
not Net* lah  trial and tested not excluded if it is credit card transaction not Nets transaction,btohqsg
i recall i had a bad experience myself where a NET* $30 transaction was possibly excluded. Of course I cannot confirm if it is 100% due to that transaction  but I still play safe then on.Similar to now when I see a grab taxi ride broken into 2 transactions  I always ignore the second one assuming classifed as Grab Topup.,btohqsg
Hi guys. If I signup Citi smrt cc and buy iPhone 15 from ishop or apple online   can I get 5% cashback ?,btohqsg

"Ohh thanks for that!I thought there might be a chance we get the bonus earlier. Read it as ""within 16 weeks""",btohqsg
i think for Citi... usually they TRY to fulfil one month ahead of the deadlilne.. so u can try watching out from deadline - 4 weeks,btohqsg
Does using amaze paired with Maybank card for local usage in singapore incur extra charges? I got charged extra in amaze app,btohqsg
Dbs app and PayLah down . Anyone experienced the same thing,btohqsg

I think was a mistake. Thanks,btohqsg
For instarem paired with Citi rewards  if I were to make a shopee purchase  should I use my instarem card or the Citi rewards cards directly for the transaction to be eligible for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Not sure why you need this. I remember the bank starts charging you interest on the day you use their money. Don’t have 21 days or more interest free period like credit card..,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website also proposed a list of best credit cards to use. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.aiThen check credit card TnC is it in whitelist or exclusion list,btohqsg
Alternatively  You can use keyword “gym” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg

Yeah I m looking for options for 1-2 days loan  besides they are offering $50 for new account apps (you don’t have make any drawdown to qualify for the $50)  just that there is a chance they may not waive the annual fee,btohqsg
Waive annual fee is not a problem. The problem will be the minimum interest charges. I thinkminimum$10/month or interest from O/S whichever is higher for 2 month. You may want to call the CSO  hopefully CSO knows how they charge cashline customer.,btohqsg
Is it possble to link Amaze card in Google Pay for iphone users? How can i share one single Amaze card with my family?,btohqsg
You can't use Google pay (paywave) in iphone right?,btohqsg
Can Citi Premier + Amaze use for overseas online spending get 2 MPD?,btohqsg
U will get 1.2mpd since sgd spend,btohqsg
If like that might as well use DBS WWMC for overseas online spending without linking to Amaze to get 4 MPD. Am I right?,btohqsg
My sep statement doesnt reflect any bonus points for aug spending. Asked the CS and they said its delayed which is weird,btohqsg
