yes  need to redeem points from Dbs altitude Amex. Assuming u redeeming miles  can select to redeem from the card and charge the redemption fee to it to use the points on dbs altitude amex before dbs altitude visa. However if u have dbs wwmc also  points on dbs wwmc will gave to be redeemed fully first before using points on dbs altitude amex  all can be done in a redemption paying fee once.,btohqsg
Thanks. Can I redeem miles just in DBS Altitude Amex only without redeeming the miles in WWMC?,btohqsg
Maybe also look at milelion‚Äôs post on the DBS auto conversion program. Seems like got use for you here if you already converting. If you have other DBS cards  and have intention to convert within the year  will be a good plan to have I think,btohqsg
cannot  points expiring earlier will be redeemed first,btohqsg
just need to pay one time fee ah  dun see why need auto program especially if want to keep points on alt visa,btohqsg
About 2-2.5 months for me. The amount will be credited into your credit card. Didn‚Äôt receive any notification from DBS,btohqsg
Cause personally don‚Äôt believe in storing points for too long. Usually my points will clear within 1-2 years.But still thinking whether I want to sign up for the programme. üòÇ,btohqsg

Here‚Äôs my humble sharing. Maybe not be the best. Don‚Äôt bash me üòÑ,btohqsg
I have only 10k miles in altitude Amex. You mean I charge the conversion fee back to Amex? But I am cancelling the card  can still charge it? How do I then make payment next month if the amex card already cancelled?,btohqsg
pay the fee and whatever charged to the card before u cancel.,btohqsg
What do you mean by per month 18th ?,btohqsg
Ignore it. That‚Äôs my own cc billing cycle haha,btohqsg
Hi all is citi pay all worth it to pay abt 50k of renovation? Cause still need to pay the admin fee of 2.2%,btohqsg
Yes if u participate in the current 2.2mpd payall promo. Please read the tnc carefully to avoid disappointment.,btohqsg
depends if you are working to accumulate miles,btohqsg
then  I'll go for citi payall  you may need to increase your citi limit is below 95% of 50K,btohqsg
ok. noted. thanks for the reminder.,btohqsg
hmm not sure they will. another way is to overpay into the credit card right,btohqsg
even for my wedding  i am feeling i sign up for the wrong card for citibank - currently citi rewardsthinking need to sign up premier miles.unfortunately not earning 120k yet to get vantage or lady solitre,btohqsg
No worries la. The best 4 mpd cards are not those 120K cards. üôÇ,btohqsg
hahah okok...this miles games make me sweat abit,btohqsg
Hi guys  I applied for uob lady‚Äôs solitaire card last Wednesday  and I received an email telling me that I need additional information(my work pass  passport and additional information form) for uob. I don‚Äôt see any upload button and additional information form on uob website under the construction on that email. Is anyone experiencing the same issue?,btohqsg
Had the same thing except via a call and they gave meuob.com/cliwhich is just for increasing the credit limit.I called in again and they gave me an email address to submit my documents to. Haven‚Äôt heard back since last Thursday,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing your experience  I‚Äôm thinking go to uob branch this weekend if no one reply me email  such bad cs from uob‚Ä¶,btohqsg
They might reach out to you via email/ phone  you may provide your supporting docs then!,btohqsg
If you have the reference ID you may try this as well,btohqsg
I have tried but all I have is this page,btohqsg
Yea uob CS has never been the best but this volume clearly is overloading them. All my recent calls were met with tired and fairly rude CS and pray hard that they do not transfer you - I waited for almost 30 mins to speak to the CS only to be put on hold for another 30 mins to be transferred to the cards team,btohqsg
On laptop is the same page  there is no upload button apparently.,btohqsg
Yes they are experiencing some hard time with ts concert and lady card open to all gender I understand them. But they make me feel like that their teams are not in sync  because the instructions on the email is not working on the website.,btohqsg
If you have HSBC Advance... $2k above 2.5% cap at $70 cash back.. so max roughly can charge up to $2800,btohqsg
I read somewhere that payall cannot use overpay method,btohqsg
try to ask for higher limit  you can request from the app,btohqsg
Does HSBC advance able to pay for insurance ? I have 18 000 insurance fees to pay at end of year.,btohqsg
Does grab paylater  a bnpl service will affect my credit score if i‚Äôm late on a payment? Ty üê±,btohqsg
I think if you miss a payment it may affect,btohqsg
No credit checks till u exceed 2k it says i dont know üôà,btohqsg
UOB just doesn't pick up the phone lol. Almost 40 mins before they transferred me to the premium queue. Then after waiting for another 30 mins the line cut off straight away. ... Guess I probably wouldn't sign up for the UOB lady solitaire card after all,btohqsg
their phone service is quite a nightmaretheir chat service still ok,btohqsg
their chat service can't really solve much tbh if u have more pressing issues,btohqsg
Doesn't work. Can only do max 95% of permanent credit limit. Overpay and charge will still fail.,btohqsg
haven touch dbs for a long time liao,btohqsg
seem like HSBC Revo promo start of the year Singsaver is paying out,btohqsg
Standard C is one of the fastest via phone but cards not that popular,btohqsg
How the credit it ah? To your bank account or to the credit card?,btohqsg
Finally received $300 for HSBC revo from SingSaver (Jan promo),btohqsg
As easy as 123 ‚Ä¶. Go to your app and click on accounts at the bottom. Then click on the credit card with the fees. Once there select the tab ‚Äòsettings‚Äô then ‚Äòwaive fees‚Äô,btohqsg
