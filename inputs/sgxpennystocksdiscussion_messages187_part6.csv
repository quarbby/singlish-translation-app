Anyone looking at Kitchen Culture (5TI)?- Prices have dropped significantly from the top following acquisition of stake in OOWAY.- Recent MD saw 26M shares being bought up by a unknown buyer at $0.1 per share.- Chartwise shows a downtrend approaching past lows where prices seem to have found support.- MACD divergence spotted showing sellers getting exhausted.All in all  looks good for a big rebound.But do note that market depth has many gaps so liquidity is a problem.
