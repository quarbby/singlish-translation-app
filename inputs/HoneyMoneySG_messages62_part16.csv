Based on my layman's understanding  someone can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.The moment you hit 55  the RA account is formed and the FRS amount is transferred to your RA account. From 55 to 65  your RA will continue to earn interest. At 65 your payout from CPF LIFE will start.Your interest technically goes to a common pool to form the annuity as such collectively everyone shares the common pool.If you pass away before the ‚Äúbreak-even‚Äù age  your unused mount will be bequest but not your interest.If you pass away after the ‚Äúbreak-even‚Äù age  technically your principal and interest earned will be more than your total payout from 65 onwards.Someone did the math to be around 83/84 depending on the plan you choose. There are 3 CPF LIFE plans  basic  standard and escalating.,btohqsg
I think long ago there was some complaint about the 10 years of missing RA interest.I‚Äôm not sure how they resolved it. Whether the interest is earned now but goes to common pool. Or interest is earned now but goes to u.I think they fixed it such that interest on RA for the 10 years still belongs to u.,btohqsg
If I read Ts and Cs  for new account  the reqt is for current month last-day balance to be more than last month's last-day balance  but the 3.5% interest will be applied on whole amount  not just incremental balance?,btohqsg
