Like those rooms can fit 4 ppl no issues,btohqsg
What am i gonna do with all that room anyway,btohqsg
Na u should look at Hall 5.. its like a freaking condo bro,btohqsg
Maybe y4 i try hall 5,btohqsg
They have glass floor to celling windows,btohqsg
If i still can get hall lmao,btohqsg
Im not good at any kind of games unfortunately,btohqsg
Im only good at getting played,btohqsg
The only game was my life,btohqsg
When I die please be at my grave so u can let me down one last time,btohqsg
Accurate depiction of my life now,btohqsg
My stayc poster dropped and im too lazy to put it back up,btohqsg
Nah i just put it against the wall,btohqsg
I just keep them in a card board roll and seal it,btohqsg
But unfortunately the moment of whatever that made it drop was too much,btohqsg
Mine collection is archieved like a library but for albums,btohqsg
My nmixx signed poster is in the tube lmao i dont even take it out,btohqsg
But i do like stayc enough to want to see it,btohqsg
I see you have rolled the dice on that one,btohqsg
Funny enough i got the ticket for a 100 bucks cat 1,btohqsg
Some dude on carousell couldn't sell it one day before the concert,btohqsg
Nmix legit no one went one,btohqsg
Cat 1 all rows filled at least,btohqsg
Unlike stayc which had pockets of empty seats,btohqsg
Carousell scalpers be like 1 day before,btohqsg
Thats more than I can say for Stayc,btohqsg
Bruh even section B had empty seats for stayc,btohqsg
Idk is scalpers or what but,btohqsg
Like my friend and i were discussing if wanna move up lmao,btohqsg
I bought at open it was damn weird,btohqsg
U go in shown as unavailable,btohqsg
Then 10 mins in they open the flood gates,btohqsg
Section B was available all the way till the last day,btohqsg
But like the last few rows,btohqsg
Idk man i feel bad for them girls,btohqsg
They aren't coming back to SG that's for sure,btohqsg
Either that or they choose a smaller venue,btohqsg
Capitol is pretty nice too but the layout is dumb imo,btohqsg
I love star theatre man but if stayc cant even fill half of that up,btohqsg
Yeah they need to scale down to Capitol Theatre or smth,btohqsg
Yeah recently been to capitol theatre,btohqsg
But yeah seems like a decent size for a small group,btohqsg
As I said I hate the layout but it's smaller.,btohqsg
Maybe Suntec Convention or Expo Convention could work,btohqsg
Ok that i havent been to,btohqsg
Itzy and taeyeon did that before too,btohqsg
I curse myself for not attending itzy concert then,btohqsg
In fact I still have the signed poster for itzy in a roll somewhere,btohqsg
Their songs were bop that period,btohqsg
Back then they didn't even have a lightstick it was literally a light. stick,btohqsg
