Dear Hustlepeople  market have been incredibly tough and i am sure many of you guys have taken a hit  as i have too and probably stucked in certain positions. Ultimately  we need to survive first and come back to fight another day. Because  if we don't  we will never get back up again. Therefore  in my daily morning greetings  i have always emphasised the importance of stop loss as I have first hand experience of losing loads of money unnecessarily back when i started trading  especially in 2012 when ABL Penny crash came along. I do not wish and want others to go through what i went. It was a really dark period then and i asked myself whether it was necessary. It really was not but i was too new then and didnt want to realise that loss early on but hanged on to hope. In conclusion  there is no hoping in this game  it is simply cut  forget and move on because if you dont  it can really wipe you out.Hope everyone is doing okay in this tough period. Lets survive the tough period together trust me  we will come back stronger when the next rally comes along. Lets go! üëç,btohqsg
but most amzon holder that sell off during dotcom burst come to regret it 20 years later..,btohqsg

Mental prep worst case scenario lol,btohqsg
Can house more ppl in greater southern waterfront,btohqsg
Over committing n risking in these troubled times is frightening. Maybe many are ignorant of what is happening around the world,btohqsg
Actually future housing will get cheaper due to 3D printing,btohqsg
Now alr most BTO are prefab right?,btohqsg
I think SG mindset is property price will never collapse.......,btohqsg
But honestly... I truly believe shipping containers as housing to be a good idea lol,btohqsg
But for my gen and those younger than me  if lucky  can inherit an HDB w >60 years on lease,btohqsg
They over rely on Govt to support prices from collapse. If not for Govt hdb scheme private sector prices would not be cushioned indirectly,btohqsg
But by the time inherit  how many per cent can inherit an HDB >60years. Maybe those recent BTOs only lor,btohqsg
Once all the old HDB in TPY  Queenstown return to govt  housing there sure damn ex,btohqsg
Who can afford to live there any more... Might as well all flip to condo...,btohqsg
Future housing may be cheaper w 3d printing,btohqsg
But land cost is added to BTO,btohqsg
How to be cheaper overall? I not sure...,btohqsg
Cities around the world are like that leh even in much bigger countries,btohqsg
Effect of 3d printing will be felt in us housing market bah,btohqsg

Buyers want cheaper  sellers want to sell higher prices. Who to please? üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
But unfortunately Sinkie mentality v hard to change. All will laugh at PG for ulu  human air filter etc etc,btohqsg
All want live near CBD only,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt this what Govt has been doing for years? End up property prices gap amongst constituencies not as big as before,btohqsg
What to do... All prestige issue,btohqsg
Burn those boomer who buy property,btohqsg
But gulf in property prices still way too large in my opinion,btohqsg
Burn those who spend beyond means,btohqsg

I got go and see the list of projects for interns for this summer at EDB. They only dedicate one intern to Sijori lol,btohqsg
Maybe EDB looking at other regions to drive growth lol,btohqsg
Actually SG Govt for years I think did encourage labour intensive factories move to jb or Batam for them to benefit n we concentrate on higher value added biz hq in SG but now with covid  that is very inconvenient bcos of travel n logistics control. Who knows n the world would hv expected the constraints of covid globally so this is an unheard of n impossible to anticipate crisis,btohqsg
Ya... Coordination is also a prob,btohqsg
Indo is 1h behind Msia and Sg,btohqsg
Sometimes idk.. I just feel like SG is... Uninspiring  for lack of a better word...,btohqsg
We are too small. As i said even got good invention cannot do well bcos our domestic market is so small to succeed well so must go overseas bigger markets to sell n hopefully they let us do so,btohqsg
