i think itâ€™s hard to pinpoint exactly what about his hyperfixation is very extra  but one of those things that you can probs tell irl that itâ€™s not normal,btohqsg
Tbh it is a common trait among people on the spectrum,btohqsg
not just on the autism spectrum spectrum,btohqsg
some forms of ADHD has a similar trait,btohqsg
But for him to qualify and do well in uni means he is mild only,btohqsg
Did the dude enter by conditional criteria,btohqsg
On the other side of the spectrum there are ppl who cant even communicate,btohqsg

What do you think of a psychiatrist directly dismissing a patient who kinda thinks they have undiagnosed adhd,btohqsg
But that is already 2nd upper,btohqsg
But it is now on a downward trend?,btohqsg
Tbh my uni grades is a roller coaster,btohqsg
It is more inappropriate in my classmateâ€™s case,btohqsg
mine is from reading and a few of my close friends that has diagnosed ADHD including my best friend,btohqsg
Idk what she told the cher but her main reason was,btohqsg
My friend told me about it coz i wqs absent,btohqsg
bro what does age have to do with this,btohqsg
she has hours that straight up is impossible for her to work. needs to time it with her aderall,btohqsg
bro I've seen 14 or 15 year olds act mature as fuck,btohqsg
yea but i don't think it's a good thing,btohqsg
uk ADHD researches are done mostly on guys instead of girls,btohqsg
age is just a number  it's not an indicator of how mature they are,btohqsg
girls who get diagnosed later are usually when they're adult,btohqsg
Like my friend who tells me he is breaking down every few days,btohqsg
why does double have the asian mindset ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
i mean just based on this itâ€™s an asshole move bc they should check but ngl when it comes to neurodivergent conditions and mental health so many people try to self diagnose,btohqsg
And he thinks it makes me feel better by saying he thinks im better than him which is clearly not true lol,btohqsg
im just chilling in the pantry area and then all of a sudden,btohqsg
my body is telling me it's maybe 6,btohqsg
She fking bs me say oh your sch records should say or behavioural traits should show,btohqsg
funny enough my main two sources of info for this are both girls diagnosed as teens,btohqsg
Don't get me wrong it exists,btohqsg
anyway the inattentive adhd one is (i think) my best friend. and sheâ€™s the vet sch person so,btohqsg
I do stupid things when i was 17,btohqsg
she found a way to deal with it,btohqsg
Things that i still regret now,btohqsg
Idk if I'm on the spectrum thh,btohqsg
I feel like I am cause of my bro,btohqsg
if you look back at your teen years and donâ€™t regret it means you havenâ€™t outgrown any stupidity,btohqsg
i alr regret stuff i did in jh ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
i mean only in uni did i find out i have smth neurodivergent too,btohqsg
Idk why a 13y/o me let my friend use my ig acct to cyberbully n then me got into trouble w the principal instead,btohqsg
