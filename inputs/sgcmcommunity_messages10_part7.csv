Taking up one whole lane including bus lane blocking traffic. Especially at specific times.,btohqsg
Maybe it depends on the education and consideration of the cyclist... unless LTA enforces  how to educate?,btohqsg
They say the grass is greener on the other side  or across the bridge in this case ðŸŒšðŸŒšðŸŒšLike our post and share your thoughts on our Facebook posthere!,btohqsg
Since sgcm got dealer award (which I think also need to take it with a pinch of salt ðŸ˜‚)  should also highlight complaints so viewers are aware.,btohqsg
This is really hard. Itâ€™s etiquette. Road manners. Fast lane is for passing cars only.,btohqsg
We don't have a fast lane actually. Lane 1 is an overtaking lane yet some people slower than lane 2 ðŸ˜ž,btohqsg
If u everyday kena Lane 1 slower than Lane 2 sth is wrong. At times lane 2 will be faster than 1 while vice versa. Just the time u on the road =D,btohqsg
I always take lane 5  fastest lane on mce,btohqsg
The so called slowest lane u mean? Hahahaha Maybe no cars lah thats why? LOL,btohqsg
oof. you know cycling at the edge is actually very dangerous  road bike thin wheels may trap in the grating.. or if the vehicle moves toward u   you have no more place to shift,btohqsg
Can cycle on paths instead of road. Too many Furious and dangerous stuns. I know there are drops and all uneven edge but ... Hais dk how to say lah.,btohqsg
these cyclists can be considered inconsiderate   but riding in the left most lane is not flouting any rules   i supposed.,btohqsg
heck  i dont like the roadies riding thru the yishun damn road on a busy sunday evening.. but still its their right.,btohqsg
Nope its not unless they cycle abreast (If thats the term of 2 cyclist cycling side by side) And its only a 2 lane lanes. Anyway there should be time that they arnt allowed on roads lah. Good to deter accidents or road rage where most motorist are on the road. Very grey but something has to be done at least. Especially those wearing Pro cyclist wear thinks they are GODs.,btohqsg
those wearing pro cyclists stuffs aint god even if they are slow. they are just richer than you.,btohqsg
This is fast lane. Lane 1,btohqsg
Sad to know i am poor. thanks for reminder now i know rich can do these stuff,btohqsg
Feel like driving in left hand drive country,btohqsg
Yes but lane 5 is empty most of the time   u see lane 1 driving at 80 lane 5 at 90,btohqsg
The Camara wonâ€™t go off even u drive at 90 but driver will reduce to 70 plus near the Camara,btohqsg
Hmmm... MCE only one stretch is 70 the rest 90 no issue ma,btohqsg
Yet many vans and sometimes even big trucks can be found on lane 1,btohqsg
I drive 90From kpe to mce only kpe got a stretch u canâ€™t drive above 80 when the sing board put 70,btohqsg
The other Camara if indicate 80 u drive at 90 also no issue,btohqsg
U can observe some car just past the Camara or after Camara then go 100 plus,btohqsg
The Camara also wonâ€™t be activated,btohqsg
I see alot of Van/Lorry going Faster than that LOL,btohqsg
that's depends on your rims size difference from the stock setting,btohqsg
I see a lot especially night taking grab after drinking   I observe them Thier speed and slowly learn the trick hehe,btohqsg
but definitely not testing the limits of speed cams LOL once shot GG,btohqsg
Then u see a hogger at lane 1 at speed 80 same speed as middle lane   then ppl over take him and brake in his face,btohqsg
He still donâ€™t want to move,btohqsg
Dun road rage can le very dangerous HAHA,btohqsg
I notice some wanted to move but the speed is same as lane 2 so instead of speeding up to change lane   they slow down to 70 and below to change lane,btohqsg
I see ppl doing this every day haha,btohqsg
I dun like MCE gg towards Pasir Ris side. At around 6-7pm the cars dun move de can stopped in tunnel. Everyone anyhow swope lanes lol,btohqsg
Ideal way of changing lane is having a faster speed,btohqsg
Is safer that way also   but most practice using slower speed to merge to faster lane,btohqsg
80 you lucky already...the hoggers mostly 60+ on lane 1 and don't want to give way either,btohqsg
A lot la haha too entitled and inconsiderate driver,btohqsg
Or those super aggressive type   but I prefer aggressive driver over road hogger,btohqsg
At least they donâ€™t block me,btohqsg
Have encountered some aggressive ones that slide in ahead of you but don't inconvenience anyone. They match your speed so well you don't have to brake.,btohqsg
If you hog roads in Germany or other countries you would be labeled a pariah and theyâ€™ll attack you.,btohqsg
Or if you ever flash your headlamps same treatment too. In Germany when a faster car approaches the car youâ€™re no matter how fast you do even at 250 must give way. Itâ€™s courtesy.,btohqsg
Because the fast lane is simply for overtaking only.,btohqsg
What we lack is courtesy and road manners or mindfulness.,btohqsg
Just because you do 110 doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™re fast and can hog,btohqsg
It's the entitlement and the kiasu-ness. Some will even brake when you want them to give way despite them not overtaking anyone. Commercial vehicles also have this weird habit of turning right from the right most lane then filtering left immediately after  and they don't notice they are causing jams by doing so. To be be clear they turned fully within their lane so there is no need to turn across lanes by taking the other one. This is when there are 2 right turn lanes and they are exiting left immediately at the next junction 200m ahead,btohqsg
Yeah entitlement. Sick really. Itâ€™s the kind of mentality of buffet. Paid and this must take as much as you can even though canâ€™t finish,btohqsg
