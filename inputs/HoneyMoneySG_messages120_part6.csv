Hi all  i using uob lady with dining as bonus category.If use with changipay at dining establishments  will it be still consider as dining? Thanksp,btohqsg
Oh alright got it! Thank you :),btohqsg
If you search the chat history  the advice for the UOB one spending is dont do the transactions especially the last few days of the months for a peace of mind.,btohqsg
Depend if changipay change the mcc  although most time it dont but best to test out using amaze with uob lady on changipay to be sure,btohqsg
Debit card will post slightly slower. So don't do last minute purchases.,btohqsg
Can we use ocbc reward in Watson apps to earn 6mpd? Or its only eligible in physical store ?,btohqsg
Think as long as have watson mcc. It is merchant specific,btohqsg
Hello Gurus! Can HSBC Revo be used on Lazada and Shopee?,btohqsg
Both have varies mcc so u are taking a hit or miss here with revo,btohqsg
Hi which card is best for overseas spend to gain 4mpd if possible - UOB Visa Signature  UOB preferred platinum  UOB lady's  DBS woman's world card or DBS vantage? Thank you,btohqsg
Uob vs as long as 1 k spend on fcy  uob ppv as long as is mobile contactless  uob lady only in your bonus cat but bundle with amaze to save on fcy fee. Dbs women world only for online. Dbs vantage got give 4mpd for fcy spending meh?,btohqsg
It's a risk using HSBC Revo for lazada and shopee due to multiple mcc. Some may connect the card to heymax  purchase refundable ones. if mcc in heymax maximizer is not valid  then cancel order. It's an option but I would not do myself.,btohqsg
Base is block of $5  bonus is accumulated for whole month‚Äôs spending.,btohqsg
Question on UOB One. I am clocking to $500 spend with the UOB debit card. Must the debit card be linked to to my UOB one account or other account also can ?,btohqsg
changipay CHANGES the mcc for me when i bought cosmetic at Shila.TLDR: Use UOB PPV with Changipay at shila safest.,btohqsg
Mcc become what?Sometime i pay with card better coz got card specific promo at shila or lotte duty free,btohqsg
Actually i realise alot of people asking lazada and shopee here for revo  why not use ocbc reward. Same 4mpd and it is merchant specific for lazada and shopee and qualify for bonus interest on ocbc 360,btohqsg
ok from what i read  changipay MCC is 5399  regardless of the merchant.changipay usually will have discount coupons for duty free in changi airport one,btohqsg
Then ppv will be the safer bet,btohqsg
To find remaining use case for Revo üòÖ or to round up and transfer all out in Jan,btohqsg
Hey max voucher i guess  can be use to buy klook then buy those dinning voucher in klook etc,btohqsg
must only be linked to Uob One account.,btohqsg
I wonder for ocbc rewards 5311 6mpd  will 5311 lazada will get 6mpd or 4mpd will override?,btohqsg
Should get 6mpd for 5311 mcc  but if varies mcc that is not 5311 4mpd will take place.It is a powerful card with 6mpd on 5311 now and it qualify for ocbc 360 500 spending,btohqsg
That why either way it is sure get at least 4mpd for lazada or shopee on ocbc rewards,btohqsg

Hi guys I wanna ask about ocbc credit card.My card got unauthorized transaction and being locked. Waiting for new card replacement. But I need to shop tomorrow (7/7 sales). CS told me if I apply for new card  I can get the digital card number with CVV instantly after approval  but not replacement card. Is that true?,btohqsg
Its true. My experience i can add the virtual card to apple pay and pay shopee via apple pay. Cannot add virtual card to shopee directly.,btohqsg
Thanks! Apple Pay is good enough üôè but not sure how long is the processing time for existing customer haha,btohqsg
My experience is 1 day as existing ocbc customer. Applied ocbc rewards on 30 jun and got approval email and the code to retrieve mcc on 1 July ard 4pm.,btohqsg

Hihi  good evening. Sorry  this question may have been asked before but I cannot search the exact answer.If say I have a GIRO plan with IRAS for bank x. But then I want to pay via CardUp instead. Do I need to cancel my GIRO plan to avoid double charge?Thank you!,btohqsg
No. When you setup on CardUp  there's a set of instructions they provide. Just follow.,btohqsg
You should keep your giro plan. And set ur cardup recurring payment a few days in advance. Iras will recognize you already paid and wont charge u again,btohqsg
Noted. Thank you so much for the swift answers!,btohqsg
Did u check your target account? Could be their side maintenance.,btohqsg
After 1130pm tonight then maintenance. Have you tried transferring to the same account during weekdays? Could be wrong account number.,btohqsg
cardup payment need to be done in the month before  at least 1 week before the giro payment on the 6th to avoid giro deduction,btohqsg

Hi Gurus   I‚Äôm new to MMF and keen to invest in MMF like Fullerton sgd Cash fund. There are questions to ask before investing:1.) Is investing MMF like to subscribe the MMF one time and let it grow the interest daily ? Or only earn the interest when you subscribe the MMF each time?2.) may I know should set up RSP to invest in MMF ? What are the strategies there ?Thanks in advance üòÖ,btohqsg
are u looking to put funds in constantly? or is just a one shot kind of thing,btohqsg
Consider either way ! What‚Äôs the difference between both way ?,btohqsg
