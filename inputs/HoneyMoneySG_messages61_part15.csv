Never had that happen before  u never use at all? I hardly use altitude now and they still waive,btohqsg
Hi guys  a quick qn  i know about the promotional rates of  SCB esaver and withdraw after the promotional period ends (aka when bonus interest comes in)  can i have 2 accounts of esaver at the same time? like 1 personal and 1 joint-acc? to take advantage of the new promotional period if SCB decides to continue... thanks,btohqsg
Never used at all for 3months haha. Still havent redeemed the voucher though. Only used it for flight and hotel...,btohqsg
instarem amaze with CRMC can get points with goFood delivery ?i saw the transaction labeled as travel ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
I didnt use much longer and i still got waiver i think they dont like you that is why. They probably want u to leave DBS,btohqsg
Try calling in to dbs Hotline and speak to cso to appeal credit card fee waiver,btohqsg
Anyone knows what does the $3 daily cap imply? For posb everyday,btohqsg
Isn't it quite self explanatory. The daily $ is the rebate you get. Max you get $3 rebate per calendar month. What part is not clear?,btohqsg
U can have 2 e-savers ac. The second ac doesnâ€™t even need to be a joint account; it could be another single e-savers ac,btohqsg
i see  so at the start of the next promotional period i just open a new e-saver account under my own name and transfer from the old one (via another bank)? Is there any other requirement aside from the 1k minimum,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think so but u can read the t&c carefully again,btohqsg
Should be safe. As long as under Lazada is fine. Just remembered insert OCBC Titanium card directly for payment. Don't use Amaze.,btohqsg
can you combine different credit card miles points together? like uob ladys and citi rewards pooled into one area,btohqsg
hi  is there any other card that offers cashback for nets app top up other than amex TCB?,btohqsg
Yea you combine it into your Krisflyer account,btohqsg
Did not realise youtrip can now be added onto iphone,btohqsg
Can I use amaze + citi rewards for SimplyGo?,btohqsg
Youcan  but... is that really what you're asking?,btohqsg
Haha just figuring out the best/efficient ways to benefit from public transport,btohqsg
Ok. what are you asking exactly? You can use it. But it doesn't earn you 4mpd  which I have a feeling is actually what you wanted to know about,btohqsg
I see. Yeah I was just wondering the most efficient/best way to earn from bus/mrt,btohqsg
Yup  but that will end EOY. Hopefully they continue with the benefits,btohqsg
hi all  anyone can share what i can do with my idle USD cash in MooMoo? Is there any sort of funds or some Stuffs that i can try to gain some interest?,btohqsg
Put in fullerton usd money market fund??,btohqsg
Until they ended up hehe extra %,btohqsg
Enjoy while It lasted they extended end of 2023 if they stopped the extra % then need to look elsewhere,btohqsg
For hsbc revo  the rewards points can only redeem for miles? Or can redeem for cashback?,btohqsg
Both but idk which one is bang for the buck,btohqsg
From uob website it state phone bill for uob evol is 0.3% while from Chris video it mention 6.67%. Is it only when I pay starhub via recurring I will earn 0.3% while if I make one time payment via the starhub website I will earn 6.67% online spend?,btohqsg
Hi guys  the 40 000 Citi Ty points is after $800 spending  how long will it take to appear after meeting the criteria?,btohqsg
Hi Champs  can u guys let me know how I can redeem HSBC Revo points to Krisflyer? I canâ€™t find much feature on HSBC Sg app?,btohqsg
Should I do it on online banking?,btohqsg
Is it right to say the diff between HSBC advance credit card and HSBC revo is as follows?:Both at 2.5% cashback. But for HSBC advance  need to spend >2k to work.Then HSBC revo is capped at $1k/mth and has the versatility to convert points to either miles or cashback.So in summary  hsbc advance credit is better for bigger ticket item every mth.,btohqsg
Yeah basically your own spending habit dictated which card actually better for you ~,btohqsg
For uob lady card  the points only can convert to miles?,btohqsg
check tmrw app. can redeem rewards etc also i think!,btohqsg
Uni dollar can be use for miles  cashback or other merchant voucher. But miles will have most cp value if redeem for biz flight,btohqsg
Someone mentioned in the group before have to keyword search  takes awhile to find haha,btohqsg
For hdb season parking renewal  is using giro the best way? It will have a 2% discount,btohqsg
Try HSBC reward website. Not all functions are available on apps..See below.https://www.hsbc.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/travel-and-leisure/,btohqsg
Because the bonus is based on transaction description and amaze changes that,btohqsg
Cuz it's transaction name specific. I tried before using amaze and no bonus given.,btohqsg
TR if it fits the whitelisted mcc,btohqsg
Need to subscribe for 1 year conversion and pay,btohqsg
Yes  amaze is useless in this case,btohqsg
Does anyone know when OCBC 360 grow and salary bonus requirements are captured? I want to move funds out to another account but want to maximize the interest earned.They usually credit the bonus interest into my account around the 10th every month,btohqsg
clear your points before cancelling the altitude card. 1 year later   then reapply for new signup gifts,btohqsg
Login to to your account using ocbc web to find out. Example can be found on ocbc 360 website.,btohqsg
Between these two  will be hsbc revo,btohqsg
Depend if u want to save on fcy fee or u can get 4mpd on uob visa signature for foreign currency spend when u spend at least 1k and cap at 2k spending,btohqsg
