Hard to answer cos there's no cost for it. Whether how beneficial is priority banking depends on how much you need or enjoy their services. It let me skip queues whenever I need physically bank over the counter  but now lots of transactions can do online. Lounge access is not fantastic and it's not near my house so can't be bothered to visit there just for free coffee n snacks.,btohqsg
Do you see your asset growth with them better than self investment? Assume you must put certain $$&,btohqsg
Usually priority banking doesn‚Äôt have attractive products to grow your money well. Use priority banking only to milk new to priority banking rewards and continue using the good high yield account offered to mass market.For real investments either u use discount brokers yourself or try to hit the private banking tier of the foreign banks to get access to the decent investment products.What products is not for me to advise. U need to talk to a licensed financial professional authorised to speak to u (and not out to just earn your high commission). And no. Not insurance agent.(Not bespoke financial advice).,btohqsg
I didn't get any investment product from them. Why do you think I have? BTW I was invited with waiver of AUM  but eventually I use their brokerage to buy local shares and plus my multiplier account balance  I was able to hit the AUM. Alternatively  one can also buy via fsmone  transfer to cdp  then into custodian to hit the AUM. I didn't do so cos I liked it's no min commission trading.,btohqsg
thanks for sharing  I have priority banking with other banks and not see the benefits.,btohqsg
from what i see so far.. priority bank is just a camouflaged term where the bank tags you as more harvestable for high margin products like insurance  unit trusts  and structured products. They cannot really offer you the decent products by design of their inferior platform.you need to get to at least priority private or asia treasures (not sure what the latest term is)... before they are allowed to offer you the real AI stuff.,btohqsg
Hi all  I want to start investing into ETFs. Was thinking about SPYL and VWRA but since both of these overlap  is there any other index fund that covers the global market with a low expense ratio.? üôèüèª,btohqsg

On 1st Jan  i know some would further optimize CPF by topping up to either MA and/or SA. If need to prioritize  should one top to MA or SA first? and then what is the rational behind?,btohqsg

Hi all. If my goal is to only achieve$8 000 tax relief (self) per YA  am I right to VCMA  and the remainder to RSTU?,btohqsg
"You can also RSTU $8k. Depending on how you want to do it.Some will choose to VCMA to hit BHS on MA first so that any contributions to MA will overflow to SA and then OA (if SA hit FRS). ""Supercharge"" SA/OA strategy.If you already hit FRS on SA  any contributions to SA will continue to stay in SA. This gives you slightly more opportunities for tax reliefs because you won't have MA overflowing to SA.",btohqsg

Hi all  if open new uob stash account today and deposit $$ today  is the MAB taken still to be/31?,btohqsg
It should start from today to month end,btohqsg
Erm why divide by 31 acct open today then it from today to month end to count mab,btohqsg
From what i experienced when opening uob one  it will be divided by days count of the month to calculate MAB (i.e 31). For uob lady saving acct  it will only count from opening date to month end. Id assume uob stash will be similar to uob one.See Queenie‚Äôs comment.,btohqsg
Stash is from day of open till end of month count like uob lady,btohqsg
Then its pretty good. Edited to reflect.,btohqsg

hi all  is there a spending limit to earn miles for hsbc travelone card? (from my understanding there isnt),btohqsg
If you want to be safe  anything not regulated by MAS = high risk  whether it's legit or not.,btohqsg
There isnt a limit to earn miles for hsbc travel one. I guess the cap is your card limit. ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Hi All  anybody has solutions for not receiving push notifications on OCBC App in China? (Tag OCBC debit card to Alipay  using VIVIFI roaming on iPhone 13),btohqsg
You must use the same telco you registered in SG for the roaming to receive the push notification.,btohqsg
But why you need to use Alipay apps? Is it you already can use OCBC apps to scan alipay QR code directly n pay?I used OCBC apps to scan Alipay QR code In Malaysia  it works n money deduct directly from my ocbc bank account.,btohqsg
FX rate is poor I reckon,btohqsg
Alipay+ fx rate is better than Visa rates + 3.25% fx fees on OCBC Debit Card. Better to just directly use OCBC app instead.,btohqsg
Seems like that is the only way out!,btohqsg
could be related to today's email announcement that going forward they will be crediting fractional units from dividends instead of Cash In Lieu.,btohqsg
Do u think its more worth it to invest my cpf in LionGlobal Infinity U.S. 500 Stock Index Fund via endows compare to getting a BTO?Representative 12M rolling returnsJan 2003 - Nov 2024Average 8.90%Best +45.34%Worst -38.28%,btohqsg
lol this would be bordering on bespoke investment advice liao.. don't think anyone should advise you on this topic here.,btohqsg
What I can say is BTO should be every Singapore resident's top priority when they come to age... guess this should be fine since it is housing advice rather than investment advice? haha,btohqsg
If you don't ever intend to move out from wherever you are staying now  then you can skip BTO... ü§£,btohqsg
investment point of view.... i would say bto returns hard to beat if intend to buy just to flipü§î,btohqsg
but but but BTO is every sg resident's free lunch!!!EDIT: pre PRIME/PLUS era... now is uncharted waters,btohqsg
