Hi guys  if you're able to choose between others / Chinese as a race for bto appliction... which will u choose? the location you're balloting is dominated by Chinese. I'm quite torn as I am worried if I choose others as race  it's hard for me to sell. Anyone can share their experience?,btohqsg
anyone know when kim keat will receive the key for housing ?,btohqsg
Hello! Can I check if anyone applied under MCPS (already chosen a unit) and parents are divorced. Can you pm me please! I have things to ask,btohqsg
i would say consider how much you want to get the unit there.. because if you think choosing Chinese will reduce your chances to potentially not even getting a unit vs having the chance of it being hard to sell  see which consequence more painful to you. FYI choosing others doesn't mean you wont be able to sell to Chinese/Malay - it depends on the EIP restrictions in that estate and block.,btohqsg
Hello Jason  just to check  each individual block EIP Quota is different and updated monthly?,btohqsg
yup  got EIP for block and neighbourhood. Updated monthly,btohqsg
I‚Äôll choose others because it is discounted as well if I‚Äôm not wrong as I don‚Äôt intend to sell. If u are planning to sell in the future in a prime location  purchase higher price as Chinese. As there are a lot more buyers. I have done a lot of resale hunting and most of the units that can‚Äôt sell that many want to buy is non Chinese sellers.,btohqsg
Also Chinese quota in prime area is definitely harder to get a house  u don‚Äôt get many non Chinese in places like holland V and Bukit Timah,btohqsg
So apply as non Chinese in prime area if u don‚Äôt intend to sell. If u intend to sell  apply as Chinese,btohqsg
This is the trend from past to now. In the future things might be different  maybe non Chinese would want to move to prime and expensive estate. But now  it is just how it is objectively.My friend (Chinese) married a Malay and they got their SFB applied as non Chinese at a prime area. This should explain what u should try to apply as haha,btohqsg
For my friend's case with his foreign spouse  the cpf housing grant for resale flat  will he be considered under singles or family?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know what‚Äôs the revised amount for the newest EHG grants? As in according to income tiers,btohqsg
not much diff for mid to higher income,btohqsg
Choose Chinese if canIf can‚Äôt choose Chinese then choose othersDon‚Äôt worry when you sell  you can appeal to HDB to sell under ChineseFrom my agent friend so far all appeal successfully as your case is others+chineseBut need sell within the 1-3 months timeline.,btohqsg

This post (or themain Jun 2024 BTO post) will be updated accordingly when HDB makes them available  or when someone from the community discovers them. Do check back at@btoapptdates.__In case you were wondering...1. The link(s) to your respective project brochure(s) is/are accessible via the HDB portal when you receive your appointment officially. This was how a past applicant managed to derive the URLs of all other brochures  as we can engineer them as long as we have the project names (that is  unless HDB decides to change the URL formats... again).2. Up until Feb 2023  there was a common page for all BTO brochures for that exercise  but this has been discontinued since the May 2023 exercise.__‚ö†Ô∏è This announcement message will be deleted and combined with themain Jun 2024 BTO postof this channel in 3 days.#jun2024,btohqsg
