if you are 24 years old  dating and planning to get married  do note that you could potentialy receive ur flat approximately at 34 years old,btohqsg
What do you mean by that? Sorry trying to understand. Cause I received 495 out of the 411 unit available.,btohqsg
There will only be 1 queue number given,btohqsg
So yes that's your queue number,btohqsg
based on 30% drop out rate  u could have the last 123.3 units of choices,btohqsg
u will still be in the race to choose lower to ground floor (if everyone chose their unit) could be possibly some high units give up too,btohqsg
yes its heng sway  some times when u are even within the 30 percentile  they will tell u all the units have been chosen,btohqsg
thats why i feel alot of  young people or first timer here  buy a toto ticket and post on fb instagram like they won the top prize,btohqsg
i ballot 5 times to get my number in 2017,btohqsg
"Hellos. So I was helping my aunt apply for 2rm flexi and got the email saying she might still have a chance if people in front of her forgo. Is that a template reply? Or it applies only to people with queue number within a certain range?For example  if only got 200 units  will a person with q number 700 still get this kind of ""dont give up! You might still have a chance!"" text? Or only people within  say the next 150 i.e. q number 201 to 350 will get this?",btohqsg
i got to wait till 2022 to get my unit,btohqsg
I also got my number in 2017.Just collected keys recently. Hand in their  bro. Soon.,btohqsg
200 units with number 700  bro  can move on to next ballot liao,btohqsg
I think all with queue number outside of supply range will get this message,btohqsg
thanks bro  its not even 50% built,btohqsg
They give number up to 300% of units available only.,btohqsg
279 to 216  maybe got chance  but dam slim  all the unwanted units,btohqsg
like those above coffeeshop or beside rubbish bin ones,btohqsg
after u get dissapointed for 5 times  u will learn that this is luck,btohqsg
Bobian. I know your frustration  now only can wait. At least you have a unit that is coming  as opposed to other people who have failed round after round after round.End goal is always to have a roof over our heads.,btohqsg
yes  and sometimes there are other underlying stuff like grandparents passing bad habits to kids  and when u teach ur kids  ur parents intervene,btohqsg
got good got bad  they can help to take care of kids  but it comes as a package  good and bad together,btohqsg
I feel u man  but u Only can pray and wait...,btohqsg
and for all the parents to be... when u plan that next year u will move  and lawrence wong comes to u with a screw driver to stick it up ur ass....,btohqsg
ur registration for kindgerten and primary school  all messed up,btohqsg
or u stay from a very far location  u got to wake up earlier to prepare the kids and send them to school  lesser sleep,btohqsg
lets talk money. CPF  there is a capped on contribution  20% and 17% on max pay at $6k. assuming u take the highest cap  u work  how many years then u times 2 by your spouse  barely can even own a condo,btohqsg
unless u willing to live like a nomad. first 5 years  buy coffeeshop chair and table and sleep on straw mat in ur flat. then once sell after MOP then buy condo  maybe got abit more,btohqsg
but then got to payback 5 years of accrued interest  left not much behind  still got to take 2nd loan,btohqsg
unless u got parents to back u up or u are some equity trader whom made it big at the stock market. if not  life is not instagramable. haha,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I successfully received a ballot # for Telok Blangah 4rm; anyone know where I can get the floor plan ?,btohqsg
log into your hdb portal and click on ur registration number,btohqsg
i clicked registration no but no direction to floorplan?,btohqsg
I think he referring to brochure,btohqsg
honestly  all these market forces are based on false perception. for those who die die want to stay in prime areas or near MRT.Covid has made the REITS in the CBD areas worthless  everyone is working from home. Stall owners in Lau Pa Sat is burning in rent  wherewas there are still operations in a coffeeshop.its all about planning. Yes it is understandable that people want to stay near MRT because they can save time to travel. but the amount you paid with accrued interest  if you stayed somewhere further  you can own a car. but did anyone dictate that you have to buy a car now? take public transport for now  and when older  or when retire  you would have saved enough to pay off the car in cash in fulli noticed that people who stayed near MRT  their neighbours are usually rented out units. these neighbours usually would not care about cleaniness or could attract undesirable patrons. And the blocks around MRT are melting pots for anyone to hang out there.,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows if there is woodgrove ascent groupchat?,btohqsg
Queenstown bro. Last time told u le.,btohqsg
Yea. Supposed to get last year  but our dear friend covid did what it does best....,btohqsg
