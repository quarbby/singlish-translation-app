No  monies topped up to a CPF Special Account through the Retirement Sum Topping-Up (RSTU) Scheme cannot be withdrawn in a lump sum. The money is intended to be used to join CPF LIFE when you turn 65 years old. CPF LIFE is an annuity scheme that provides a monthly payout for life.,btohqsg
Thanks. So in that sense  I can only draw out my working SA contribution (let say SA is sufficient and leave OA aside first) -FRS and that example 300k-250k=50k. My RA will still got 250k (FRS)+ 100k(RSTU)=350K which will use to compute cpf life payout at 65,btohqsg
And can I check if normal OA to SA transfer got this lump sum withdrawal restriction as well?,btohqsg
Hi for OCBC reward card spending on health screening is it eligible for the OCBC$ bonus?,btohqsg
Your example looks confusing. Do you mean if you have 200k normal contributions and 100k rstu  how much would you get at the age of 55?,btohqsg
Ah I use MT scenariosFor example:Normal contributions over the years = $300kRtsu = $100kFrs = $250kYou will still be able to easily withdraw $150k (400-250).,btohqsg
I have not looked into this but based on my interpretation of the advice above  your RA would consist of the 100k rstu and 150k from normal contributions I.e. You can withdraw the 150k remaining from your normal contributions and your RA would be 250k.,btohqsg
So I don't understand why does your RA has 350k instead of 250k though there is nothing stopping you from topping up.,btohqsg
However I may have interpreted it wrongly too.,btohqsg
Hmm I think I get it now. I keep excluding rstu in my FRS and thinking it as FRS can only include working contribution,btohqsg
And rstu only is an add on to that amount,btohqsg
But don't know why the cpf woman told me this...I.e. at 55  I have FRS + 12Kbut before I turn 55  I RSTU 8K  so does that means I can only with 4k only? She told me yes...asSo the logics should be I still can withdraw 12k as that 8k form up my FRS. The excess is treated as from my working contribution,btohqsg
But when you already reach FRS  you are not allowed to RSTUSo you cannot top up the $8k,btohqsg
I think there is some confusion caused in your question. I assume you rstu the 8k before you hit frs so the calculation could be a bit more complicated than that.,btohqsg

Maybe before I FRS  I top up  then compounding make it to FRS. And also through my work contribution before frs,btohqsg
Yup  this is what I mean,btohqsg
She might have been confused I guess. Given if that is the case  it would be hard to give you a figure but rightfully you should be able to withdraw 12k,btohqsg
Any gurus who has more knowledge please correct me if I am wrong.,btohqsg
Hi all  anybody facing issues topping up touch and go wallet using YouTrip card ? Any workarounds ?,btohqsg
CPF  website is not clear on whether SA reserved funds are included in FRS computation.The best person to answer this would be to check with CPF themselves.There are several non-CPF datapoints though that seems to suggest so. Up to you whether to trust them.[Removed to comply with community guidelines - Go google article from HeartlandBoy]https://endowus.com/insights/manage-cpf-retirement-before-55#:~:text=To%20form%20the%20CPF%20Retirement%20Account%2C%20your will%20be%20used%20to%20form%20the%20FRS.,btohqsg
Hi  would like to ask about using cardup to pay my income tax.i have a monthy giro to iras with my ocbc bank account  if I use cardup to pay for my income tax  what happend to my monthly giro? Meaning i will pay double ..? I'm not sure how cardup works..,btohqsg
set up ur cardup deduction date before your ocbc deduction (usually 1 week  ill let others advise). Iras then will recognize you already pay for that month and wont trigger ocbc deduction.,btohqsg
Hi! Happy holidays everyone! May I ask which card to link with Amaze is the best for overseas use? And this may sound silly  only Mastercard CC can be linked to Amaze? TIA! üòä,btohqsg
Hi everyone! New to the group here  I need to ask what are the top things to do to have tax deduction,btohqsg

Income tax relief video coming in two days,btohqsg
Thank you Anthony! Only rewards card from citi right? Citi cashback and premiermiles card doesn't count right?,btohqsg
there are some use cases for citi cashback (not cashback+). Citi premier miles is not worth using with Amaze if i recall correctly.,btohqsg
Hi all  beginning of the year soon.  Should we top up Medisave account? If SA already met FRS.,btohqsg
Can watch this amaze review firsthttps://youtu.be/rSbZXpIFp14?si=v0AEh3WjOxbxh-bR,btohqsg
hi  reviewing my credit card options for cashback. currently holding an UOB EVOL card with UOB One account. any recommendations for anything better?,btohqsg
not sure abt the others  i stopped using EVOL when they changed the T&C and went back to UOB One CC,btohqsg
was thinking of changing to UOB One CC too,btohqsg
yeah  i mean its more versatile for me since it covers SP,btohqsg
what attracted me was the higher cashback for purchases on shopee. since im getting most of the things online nowadays,btohqsg
hi. for educational related like those tuition centers.. heymax unable to find such vendor.. what can be a good card to charge? I have only DBS and UOBs,btohqsg
Explore HSBC Live+ or Citi Cash Back. I use them both for cash back.HSBC min spend $600/mthCiti Cash back $800/mth,btohqsg
If I have hit the max cpf contributions of $37 740  can I still enjoy tax relief if I do VCMA ?,btohqsg
I think this limit only applies to your employer? According to:https://www.cpf.gov.sg/service/article/what-are-the-applicable-limits-if-i-wish-to-make-voluntary-contributions-vc-for-my-employeesI don't think VCMA or RSTU are affected by the CPF Contribution Cap; only by the max tax relief cap of $80k,btohqsg
Any Shifus here on Reits ? What do you guys think of Capitaland Ascott Trust and Capitaland Ascendas Reits?,btohqsg
Coz I saw this  now wondering if I still can VCMA,btohqsg
can click and will tell u how much more u can contribute,btohqsg
When you start the top up journey n login  it will show the amount you can still top up,btohqsg
Ok thanks all! My qns is answered after I clicked the link. If you're curious they allow me to top up  but I'm just wondering if they will refund me on 1st Jan since technically I have hit the max cpf contributions for the year (mandatory + voluntary),btohqsg
Sorry gurus I would like to seek your views on card up. I am planning to make a one time insurance payment of 2000sgd. I should be getting 2800 miles by using card up but I would be paying like $45.20 (2.26%) for the fees. As I value miles at 0.125 cents each  it seems like I would be paying more for the miles. I am not sure if my calculation or thinking is correct.,btohqsg

Some banks have started the cooling feature for 12 hours if you are just trying to increase the limit transfer for the day. Going to be troublesome jumping around for High savings account. Anyone encountered this already?,btohqsg
