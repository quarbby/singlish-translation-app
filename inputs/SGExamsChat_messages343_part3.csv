He then rushed out of the shower and like ran to the Teachers. Then got one senior outside he saw like some back figure in another part of the building and it was night and he say someone . Then idk but someone said he got so scared that he ran down the stairs to where all the cher were and then he was like so scared then like he couldn’t even walk and then the cher send ppl who like were scared and wanted go home,btohqsg
