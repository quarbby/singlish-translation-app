Nope  not available in Singapore as yet,btohqsg

There were only 150 units ever madeCame with a half cage  racing buckets  further weight reduction  adjustable front apron and rear wing  polycarbonate rear windows  titanium backbox  400cc increase in displacement and further adjustability for suspension,btohqsg
Basically a track focussed and more raw version of the e92,btohqsg
And it carried the e92 clout as well with the V8,btohqsg

Very few street cars appreciate in value globally on a sound commercial and technical basis. Almost EUR250 000 for this one.https://www.autoevolution.com/news/rare-bmw-e92-m3-gts-for-sale-with-1118-miles-has-a-very-exotic-price-tag-182866.html,btohqsg
And I’m sure there is a solid reason why you’re still happily driving your awesome and genuinely best sounding blue m3 around. Envyyyyyyyy 🥰🥰,btohqsg
I’m sure many look at your car on the road sir.,btohqsg
Hahaha plus the fact that since we are all SGCM PRs  we probably see that certain cars hold value well and it’s often not that much to do with its brochure figures like 0-100 or hp/torque 🤔,btohqsg
Not just contis. There are some beautiful collectible jap cars too which hold value so well 👍🏼,btohqsg
That is because it is meant for people to avoid the surge in prices but end up most people choose otherwise  where they put all their wealth into a single pot to afford it to suit their wants and not cover their needs,btohqsg
I think I been recall twice lioa,btohqsg
Honda reveals first teaser images of new CR-VThe new SUV is said to get a sportier driving experience👀Between the CR-V and its competitors  which would you pick?👉🏻  React with ❤️ for the Honda CR-V!👉🏻  React with 🥰 for the Mitsubishi Outlander!👉🏻  React with 😁 for the Subaru Forester!👉🏻  React with 👍🏻 for the Toyota RAV4!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Happens lah. But doesn’t automatically mean the car is not good for sure 👍🏼,btohqsg
Think once is track mode issue,btohqsg
wait till mr x sees the m3 crt,btohqsg
Shld come out crv ev version,btohqsg
Jap cars are lagging behind China and European cars in terms of ev,btohqsg
New Honda Fit and civic so cute,btohqsg
I think his smile will be even wider this morning when he starts up his V8.,btohqsg
No he is not happy because of petrol notice,btohqsg
Nah. This is like Tesla owners complaining why almost every function has to be via the touchscreen even the simplest functions. Or that regular tow trucks can’t tow a break down Tesla coz of the motor at each wheel.,btohqsg
One buys a V8 performance ride knowing it will most likely not be the most fuel economical on the planet 😁😁,btohqsg
Not performance also got smaller engine ma hehe   anyway it different la,btohqsg
This special Ora he one in limited prediction is cool. Singapore has how many? I remember the air conditioning originally is removed but for singapore version it’s added in.,btohqsg
This is the very last 2013 one in 4 door. Rare indeed.,btohqsg
But X’s m3 is just a competition edition of m3 with carbon roof. Not gts nor crt.,btohqsg
1/20 worldwide i think the crtsingapore only has 1,btohqsg
What else is different except it’s carbon roof 4 door. The gts is special meant for track this I remember.,btohqsg
Wah.. I love your use of the “Just” word sir. Yeah his M3 is only the 4.0L aluminium V8 double VANOS  individual throttle bottle  with DCT on Drivelogic  stock lowered suspension and carbon fibre roof which is a work of art in itself… it’s almost… mundane.,btohqsg
All vents are technically functional  and that sounndddddd on 8 400rpm redline…,btohqsg
No la. Don’t mean “just”. What I meant is would this version fetch rising value? It’s not limited edition GTS,btohqsg
My guess is.. yes. Like the e46 m3 and the e46 m3 csl,btohqsg
Like manuals  and some specific Jap models  and car makers downsizing engine capacity+compression  and more EVs  certain types of vehicles will become increasingly sought after. Like this generation with its very special engine and DCT  while keeping it very daily usable.,btohqsg
But. That’s just my coffee shop uncle opinion only of coz.,btohqsg
You just touched a sweet spot. I love all original Fairlady.,btohqsg
I would take that any day (including the fender mirrors) and be a very happy man.,btohqsg
