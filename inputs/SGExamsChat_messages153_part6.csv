Don't focus on it. Focus on the A level exam ahead  not the past.,btohqsg
Its easy to say that until u realise that overseas uni apps take prelims nd predicted score rather than wait for alevels to be over,btohqsg
But if you don't do well in the A levels  you won't meet the conditional offer and you are still out,btohqsg
What I'm saying is that it is pointless to do well in prelims and do terribly in A levels,btohqsg
That was never the contention but aite,btohqsg
At least for those doing NS  they have a few opportunities to apply for overseas universities,btohqsg
Time for girls to go NS then,btohqsg
They have leeway to resit for As too,btohqsg
Yeah  but how are you going to study for As in NS? People don't have the mood,btohqsg
Ik a lot of ppl who have studied and are studying,btohqsg
Most of them did well for As in NS,btohqsg
Yes  so I heard. But many have said it was arduous because NS makes them so exhausted and balancing time is so difficult  unlike in JC,btohqsg
Although those who went through JC would find it easier as they have went through the process,btohqsg
Yup its really not simple as it sounds,btohqsg
It depends a lot on your vocation.,btohqsg
If you kena combat then forget about it,btohqsg
But I doubt you can bring your A level work to camp and study while you are supposed to be working. And even in your break time I'd imagine it would be noisy and people wanting to talk to you,btohqsg
It depends.. if the individual is borderline and wishes to do better  it would be easier. But for those whose foundation is totally weak.. itâ€™s gonna be a lot of hardwork for them (at night n wkends) after the ns outfield training,btohqsg
Yeah but you cannot guarantee it will be non combat  unless you get PES C or E,btohqsg
Yes.. harder to find chance. Unless the individual is really boss and able to dgaf to what his seniors and peers r gonna say haha.,btohqsg
That's why you need to wait until after BMT to find out what vocation you're in,btohqsg
Haha maybe he referring to those who r not so lucky,btohqsg
Mfw its 8 months and im still in BMT,btohqsg
Which would be too late to those hoping to retake A levels if they get a combat vocation,btohqsg
Meanwhile i have friend in music and performing arts vocation.. (is there such vocation??) quite senang ley,btohqsg
I think it is to boost the morale of the soldiers?,btohqsg
ðŸ¤£ hahahahaah!!! I was shocked when my sis told me that too hahhahaahahah,btohqsg
Why would u play music to boost morale of the soldiers,btohqsg
I think itâ€™s to directly contribute to the ministry of arts in sg?,btohqsg
Oh I thought they go around different camps to perform to boost the morale hahahaha,btohqsg
Yes this. Like directly contributing to that purpose,btohqsg
I think it is more for things such as NDP,btohqsg
HAHAHHAAHAHAH ya first tot that came to my mind too,btohqsg
Last thing i would want is random ppl coming to my camp to play music and me being forced to watch it during OTOT,btohqsg
Meanwhile every day I go there use phone until bookout,btohqsg
I would tilt instead of raising my morale,btohqsg
Which vocation r u in?? Sounds quite shiok,btohqsg
My friend from bio radio dunno what.. his allowance quite high,btohqsg
I think it goes according to rank,btohqsg
Wahts the name of that called?,btohqsg
Well  I doubt they have increased the allowance by a lot,btohqsg
Uhh ya whats CBRE stand for?,btohqsg
Do people have to address someone with higher rank as sir ALL THE TIME?,btohqsg
I tot sir is a very generic form of address to seniors,btohqsg
Oh  how frustrating to talk to them. Yes sir no sir I am good sir. Erh,btohqsg
Its only frustrating if u think its frustrating,btohqsg
Aiya it depends how close u r to them,btohqsg
U dun have to put in every single sentence la,btohqsg
So what extent does malay get used in the army?,btohqsg
last time when i was in taekwondo  the seniors = higher beltthen there was this sec 1 who was like black belt  and i join in sec 4 with white belt,btohqsg
