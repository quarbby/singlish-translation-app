Just now evening got 1 short time frame  this platform orders +$20,btohqsg
Then my friend took. Got the job,btohqsg
I kena b4 last time. I think besides using lalamove  they also using other platforms. When no drivers they will throw out this big ++,btohqsg
Then as long as u haven't collected etc  once they get other drivers from other platform which cheaper they will cancel ur job,btohqsg
This is my theory bah. Happened tdy to my friend. Lucky he haven't otw over,btohqsg
Then those +20 jobs tdy disappear. After quite some time appear again no +,btohqsg
All is job from this platform,btohqsg
