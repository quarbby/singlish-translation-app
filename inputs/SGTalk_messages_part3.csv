If u r delivering  the hawker give u nicely and when the food reaches the customer is spilled.... surely u are at fault regardless of the reasons  customer tellUr boss. .... how many times can he cover u?,btohqsg
But having said that   it’s your right to complain since you should receive your goods in good order,btohqsg
So appealing to u to see if u can forgive him lor:)),btohqsg
No la  I am not delivery rider haha,btohqsg
I receive spilled order  but I dunno if should complain cos dun wan affect the rider,btohqsg
I know I am asking u to imagine,btohqsg
If foodpanda cover then ok lor  if penalise the rider then sua,btohqsg
If u are panda u want to always cover,btohqsg
Maybe say x times for Y trips,btohqsg
Then our fren sway already kannaLiao,btohqsg
Later if he lose his job then I hope u feel bad,btohqsg
But is your right lah bro....just thot if not serious then maybe sua la,btohqsg
I don’t think the rider will be penalised to the point where his job is on the line tbh.,btohqsg
While you can be compassionate and understanding. Ultimately  safely delivering product with an acceptable amount of blemishes. Is part of the job. However this responsibility do not solely rest on the shoulders of the rider imo,btohqsg
It could also be the food provider’s packaging issue or overloading of jobs from service provider  building on stress applied to the rider to deliver your consumables in a timely fashion.,btohqsg
Your complaint could highlight a tendency or weak link in the supply chain.Either helping service provider identify if this is an isolated incident  unique to this rider. If the incident is unique to this rider then maybe he’s need to go easier on his speed because definitely you’re not the only ordered that’s affect.Or maybe it’s to the food provider’s packaging not very suited to be delivered in that particular way. After all  just because they wrap the food plastic container and plastic bag don’t mean it’s going to be 100% spill-free. Especially so because a food delivery thermal bag is not exactly an world class secure equipment.,btohqsg
