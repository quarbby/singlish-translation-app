its small like the old corolla wagons in the 80s,btohqsg
"Toyota car motto""Let's Go Places is the verbal expression that captures the essence of the Toyota brand.""Bring to Point A to Point B.There is no power in it😂Not like MazadaZoom Zoom Zoom 😂Or HondaPower of Dreams😂👍",btohqsg
no la not expecting to be fast  but decent enough to overtake smoothly etc,btohqsg
1 500cc same engine as sienta. Yaris cross.BHP maybe 98hp.slow car 😜 but can load bicycle 👍,btohqsg
@bbfasingaporethis guy is missing.  must be playing stock markets,btohqsg

and then complains of toyota honda hogging him...,btohqsg
Toyota police hog see he complain or not😂😂🤣,btohqsg
tesla x is not yet available from tesla pre ordr right,btohqsg
Nope  not available in Singapore as yet,btohqsg
i think you can buy another tesla,btohqsg
There were only 150 units ever madeCame with a half cage  racing buckets  further weight reduction  adjustable front apron and rear wing  polycarbonate rear windows  titanium backbox  400cc increase in displacement and further adjustability for suspension,btohqsg
Basically a track focussed and more raw version of the e92,btohqsg
And it carried the e92 clout as well with the V8,btohqsg
https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/10/23065987/tesla-recall-130000-vehicles-fix-touchscreen-issues-caused-overheating-cpu-amd-ryzenhope no one here was affected by the recalls!,btohqsg
Very few street cars appreciate in value globally on a sound commercial and technical basis. Almost EUR250 000 for this one.https://www.autoevolution.com/news/rare-bmw-e92-m3-gts-for-sale-with-1118-miles-has-a-very-exotic-price-tag-182866.html,btohqsg
And I’m sure there is a solid reason why you’re still happily driving your awesome and genuinely best sounding blue m3 around. Envyyyyyyyy 🥰🥰,btohqsg
I’m sure many look at your car on the road sir.,btohqsg
Hahaha plus the fact that since we are all SGCM PRs  we probably see that certain cars hold value well and it’s often not that much to do with its brochure figures like 0-100 or hp/torque 🤔,btohqsg
Not just contis. There are some beautiful collectible jap cars too which hold value so well 👍🏼,btohqsg
That is because it is meant for people to avoid the surge in prices but end up most people choose otherwise  where they put all their wealth into a single pot to afford it to suit their wants and not cover their needs,btohqsg
I think I been recall twice lioa,btohqsg
Honda reveals first teaser images of new CR-VThe new SUV is said to get a sportier driving experience👀Between the CR-V and its competitors  which would you pick?👉🏻  React with ❤️ for the Honda CR-V!👉🏻  React with 🥰 for the Mitsubishi Outlander!👉🏻  React with 😁 for the Subaru Forester!👉🏻  React with 👍🏻 for the Toyota RAV4!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Happens lah. But doesn’t automatically mean the car is not good for sure 👍🏼,btohqsg
Think once is track mode issue,btohqsg
wait till mr x sees the m3 crt,btohqsg
Shld come out crv ev version,btohqsg
Jap cars are lagging behind China and European cars in terms of ev,btohqsg
New Honda Fit and civic so cute,btohqsg
I think his smile will be even wider this morning when he starts up his V8.,btohqsg
No he is not happy because of petrol notice,btohqsg
Nah. This is like Tesla owners complaining why almost every function has to be via the touchscreen even the simplest functions. Or that regular tow trucks can’t tow a break down Tesla coz of the motor at each wheel.,btohqsg
One buys a V8 performance ride knowing it will most likely not be the most fuel economical on the planet 😁😁,btohqsg
Not performance also got smaller engine ma hehe   anyway it different la,btohqsg
This special Ora he one in limited prediction is cool. Singapore has how many? I remember the air conditioning originally is removed but for singapore version it’s added in.,btohqsg
This is the very last 2013 one in 4 door. Rare indeed.,btohqsg
But X’s m3 is just a competition edition of m3 with carbon roof. Not gts nor crt.,btohqsg
1/20 worldwide i think the crtsingapore only has 1,btohqsg
What else is different except it’s carbon roof 4 door. The gts is special meant for track this I remember.,btohqsg
Wah.. I love your use of the “Just” word sir. Yeah his M3 is only the 4.0L aluminium V8 double VANOS  individual throttle bottle  with DCT on Drivelogic  stock lowered suspension and carbon fibre roof which is a work of art in itself… it’s almost… mundane.,btohqsg
All vents are technically functional  and that sounndddddd on 8 400rpm redline…,btohqsg
No la. Don’t mean “just”. What I meant is would this version fetch rising value? It’s not limited edition GTS,btohqsg
My guess is.. yes. Like the e46 m3 and the e46 m3 csl,btohqsg
Like manuals  and some specific Jap models  and car makers downsizing engine capacity+compression  and more EVs  certain types of vehicles will become increasingly sought after. Like this generation with its very special engine and DCT  while keeping it very daily usable.,btohqsg
But. That’s just my coffee shop uncle opinion only of coz.,btohqsg
You just touched a sweet spot. I love all original Fairlady.,btohqsg
I would take that any day (including the fender mirrors) and be a very happy man.,btohqsg
The air-conditioned and iDrive was an optional delete on the GTS worldwide but many decided to spec air-conditioning because they didn't want to melt 😂😂. iDrive not so much. I believe there's at least 1 in Singapore,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/SCJDY04hsLIHere's a video done by a pretty well known car content creator when he was visiting Singapore on his world drive,btohqsg
Chris Harris personally might a regular competition edition for his own use,btohqsg
There's only 25 RHD units out of the 150 GTS' ever made,btohqsg
"Very few with the GTS actually drive them too much as it is classed as a collector's car  many keep it to low or delivery mileage. The ""regular"" e9X M3s are also on the rise as they start entering the modern classic era slowly and offer a great driving experience and a V8 motor in an M3",btohqsg
HAah he block non ev in parking lot so can wait for security clamp Thier car also,btohqsg
I think he feeling great to help the security get some bonus,btohqsg
You should not mask out number plate. This is inconsiderate act and must be exposed. A lesson to him,btohqsg
Let it be known that the owner of this car if he feels embarrassed he just mot do this in future,btohqsg
Great world city ppl usually rich 1   $150 cheap cheap to to release   good money for the management,btohqsg
Disgusting is those still want argue and don’t pay   look just to cheap,btohqsg
If drive jeep.Lock the 5th wheel hanged behind the door too 😂👍,btohqsg
HAha $150 to release the clamp la or is good money actually,btohqsg
Hope got new laws that can tow   even better,btohqsg
See 1 day can tow how many,btohqsg
Ya I don’t dare anyhow park in us   kana tow far away,btohqsg
Not you? That isn’t your Tesla?,btohqsg
I don’t do that 1 usually I make sure the security come and clamp,btohqsg
With stock rising so much You must be happy man,btohqsg
Yeah. Nvm know who driving the those car that you block.There was a case at the multi carpark beside zouk.Someone kick an estima. 7 pax exit and whack that guy.He passed away..,btohqsg
Wah Lao why go kick ppl car   just inform security to clamp la,btohqsg
U see the logo so big,btohqsg
Why did that guy do that? No parking spaces?,btohqsg
Tesla driver nasty. Bmw driver is victim,btohqsg
A lot of ppl lazy to find lot or want better lot so they just park lol,btohqsg
Logo no use.Must learn from condo security.At guard house display many different type for clamp😂,btohqsg
Is like playing a game will I get summon will I get clamp,btohqsg
Then deserved to be whacked. Teach that morherf*** a lesson,btohqsg
As long as he pay   contribute back to society,btohqsg
I’m sure you got clamped before,btohqsg
No I only get getting summon for parking yellow line till I got demerit point,btohqsg
I think 1 year kana like 15,btohqsg
So where you gonna floor your Tesla today? Which traffic lights?,btohqsg
Usually I floor when over taking,btohqsg
Haha no la. You jackrabbit style,btohqsg
Is use for those road hogger that accelerating when I want over take,btohqsg
Then can see they have a sour face,btohqsg
Tesla stock to 840 next week,btohqsg
I holding it for 3-5 years,btohqsg
I think this guy park there cause the bmw and estima parked in the electric lot. All 3 get clamped lol,btohqsg
Bank intreast too low la 0.8% only   need to park some where,btohqsg
So many say Tesla is poorly built. How’s yours,btohqsg
Made in Shanghai right. What complaints do you have,btohqsg
No rattles when you drive? Quiet?,btohqsg
No la lol when floor not quiet can what eletric motor sound,btohqsg
Tyre profile narrow 235/35/20 so is bumpy,btohqsg
What’s the economy like? How many cents for km,btohqsg
U should go test drive   trust me u will love it,btohqsg
Volvo C40 Recharge scores high at Euro NCAPVolvo cars remain one of the safest cars on the road today🙏🏻👉🏻  React with ❤️ you are a Volvo fan!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Even my friend drive gtr 1 test drive said is really impressive,btohqsg
sir why you so sensitive with emotion i know you like euro cars,btohqsg
i like cars that dont go kaboom right after an engine rebuilt,btohqsg
hahahah sorry i’m very naive 😭,btohqsg
does your favourite car have euro ncap 5 stars?,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA its all banter😂😂 i love wrx and forester STI 😂😂,btohqsg
You got one chance to like one  after that just burn paper one can already,btohqsg
VA STI is a really good looking car imo,btohqsg
super solid car dude HAHAHA ❤️,btohqsg
cannot anyhow say i euro car guy and naive hor  i love subaru and honda 😄,btohqsg
So many models I never see b4,btohqsg
Forester solid last time my Cooper s been eaten alive in aye lol,btohqsg
The Honda Nbox is the best selling K-Car in Japan.Quite expensive hereClose 93-98k last year.😅,btohqsg
haha subaru actually very safe one i think they like japanese volvos tbh safety ratings alw high,btohqsg
but can subaru last as long as volvo? volvo 1 engine 1mil km. subaru 100k 1 engine?,btohqsg
jimny is quite a good car if you travel to msia thailand alot but in sg abit weird,btohqsg
no I was tempted to buy one but decided against it,btohqsg
cause not family friendly enough T_T,btohqsg
HAHA agreed. its abit too small for a family but for couples should be just right,btohqsg
the rear and front seat can fold down all the way leh😉😉,btohqsg
ya  I think it's a good enough esp. if you have a doggo and maybe 1 kid!,btohqsg
Yeah. I drove Toyota Sienta before.Got IKEA and fit in a 2metre curtain track 😍In Taiwan  they fit in a 125cc scooter😂👍,btohqsg
Anyone knows where to get platform(?- not sure what it is called) to cover this? So can put some stuffs on top,btohqsg
When you brake hard. The stuff will fly infront😁Must pull up the headrest or bungy cot,btohqsg
Need to look for your car specifically  called a load cover or retractable parcel shelf,btohqsg
Must be sub 4 metre iirc,btohqsg
To prevent the cargo from fly infront.   It quite soft. Put any weight on it . Will bend，not stable,btohqsg
Also for security in case you want to keep what's in your boot hidden,btohqsg
Usually u can't put heavy items on top leh  usually just cover for privacy nia,btohqsg
Here is a mixed of all car owners and enthusiast. Car lovers. Petrol head. I don’t own Euro car.,btohqsg
Contradictory of what I own  but I like 90s JDMs,btohqsg
I like euro cars with Asian cars reliability. is there such a thing in market?,btohqsg
lexus is japanese what is that logic lol,btohqsg
not really  they're still rebranded nissans and hondas just like scion,btohqsg
infinity is Eurasian . Nissan cross renault🤣,btohqsg
"I do like their imposing front though. shouting look "" I am luxury car"".!!",btohqsg
seems like no pure euro car with great reliability in the motor world,btohqsg
reliability is definitely good  solid merc engine,btohqsg
it has inherited the worse part of nissan - heavy weight,btohqsg
Kei cars refer to automobiles with a size of 3.4 m in length  1.48 m in width  and 2 m in height or less  respectively  and a displacement of 0.66 liter or less,btohqsg
Not sure how sienta can qualify,btohqsg
those kallang car park race cars like purple honda civics right,btohqsg
"yeah this has been what i wanted to say. why cant they do that. this owuld sound ""complete"" and perfect",btohqsg
90s JDM now only left the tiong chia,btohqsg
although got exception like the old miatas,btohqsg
so you do recognize euro cars are less reliable compared with Japanese right. that is what i have been saying. 😉 that started the heated debate yesterday,btohqsg
why they dont allow kallang car races anymore? would like to see turbos pitt against each other,btohqsg
There's still a few private gymkhana events that are held,btohqsg
i saw this video last time. old volvos are incredibly reliable. the same cannot be said for the newer ones. for example  my friend had his 7-year old suv dct gerbox repaired 3 times.,btohqsg
it was a ford gb.. now that volvo is part of geely  it is back to being reliable,btohqsg
the biggest difference i noticed under geely is the marked improvement in styling. the exterior styling is very appealing. significantly better looking than old brick coffin lookin g volvos.you dotn repair CT gerbox 3 times  despite 7 year old car. it onoy has 170k km,btohqsg
it was a known issue that is why volvo decided to split from ford,btohqsg
other than that dct  it has always been reliable,btohqsg
i see so many XC90 from 04 still driving around w their 5cylinders,btohqsg
anyone drove saab before? i drove my classmate's saab 9000cd. real fast for a brick large car for 23 liter LPT engine,btohqsg
I like EG and EK in their stock form. hahaThe unique one in the bench is CRX Del Sol,btohqsg
Delsol 😍 almost ended up buying one,btohqsg
this is from personal experience of 3 euro n 3 Asian cars...,btohqsg
Asian cars dun throw errors easily,btohqsg
so dun hearsay . try out urself😎,btohqsg
it's either working  or not working hahaha,btohqsg
This is the trend from what I see as a bystander:60/70s European cars: Simplicity  easy to maintain. Break easily but easy fix. On the other side: MURICA MUST HAVE V8s!!!80s Germans especially Mercedes Benz/BMW: COMPETITION  let over engineer and outdo competitor brand (M3  190E rivalry yay)90s Germans: Now we know what we are doing  we gotta stop overengineering and think of planned obsolescence or else people keep sticking to their old cars.Meanwhile 90s Japan: WATASHI WA OVER-ENGINEERING DESULate 90s~late 2000s: Global Economic crash  japan lost years in economy. Japan chilled and their turn for planned obsolescence.From 2010s: Kimchi is getting nicer and stronger.,btohqsg
can start or cannot start.  two schools of thought. all things mechanical will fail and the automotive is a complex system. Some owners are happy as long as the car can start and moves.  Some like to know early where certain parts of the system are starting to go off  before they potentially start a daisy chain of causing larger damage and required repairs.,btohqsg
end of the day  go for a car which suits your personality  and budget to achieve the greatest happiness,btohqsg
ya any car regardless it's cheap or exp. most important must suit u n yr lifestyle,btohqsg
there will always be owners who want more information from the car  and those who don't need to be flooded by all these information.,btohqsg
i know owners who even buy OBD and software and routinely scan the car themselves at home for even minor codes which the car doesn't feel is serious enough to throw an alarm light!,btohqsg
what hearsay are you talking about? i mentioend this based on my experience of owning BMWs and jaopanese cars vios and mazda. are you lost somewhere?,btohqsg
mazda is full of sensors. too many too. but they dont breakdown,btohqsg

Hmmm  bmw also have sir. Must compare apple to apple  similar age cars. E92 vs Mazda 6 cannot I think  can compare Mazda 6 to 3 series or 5 series can!!!,btohqsg
We will keep supporting! Hopefully got more chances for the giveaway 👀🙃,btohqsg
Me also me also! I also want thumbs up#fomo,btohqsg
anyone got experience faulty folding side mirrors on their mazda 6?,btohqsg
Wahhhh  must ask our Mazda expert@Cxspeed. Not sure if can fix though  Mazda never fails,btohqsg
i am not sure leh Mr Ur mother  but i think Mr X might be able to help,btohqsg
I think it’s not really what you say but how you say.,btohqsg
i hardly fold. and no problem,btohqsg
i  dont know. nothign has broken down on my car yet,btohqsg
Mr Ur mother  have you checked online?,btohqsg
maybe today u try fold then also cannot fold,btohqsg
Ok  your car cannot fix don't drive. Can?,btohqsg
yepp  i see they ask go shop  i go shop they asking 200 to change one actuator sia HAHHAHAHA,btohqsg
Sorry sorry a bit much I agree,btohqsg
Was this at the AD or outside. If AD  can try outside  might be cheaper,btohqsg
go to accessory shop to get it checke,btohqsg
Go change the motor or the gears that connects could be worn out  common wear and tear problem.,btohqsg
yep  its common failure for mazda,btohqsg
Ahh  I pm'd you a shop that fixed something similar for me before. Can try contacting them  hope it works!,btohqsg
i change the right one when under warranty. now the left one like cnt even movee,btohqsg
u try to find cheaper shop ba,btohqsg
Disconnect it and leave it opened if u dun need the folding function,btohqsg
Must fix no choice then  at max can get cheaper shop.,btohqsg
Most cars😅 I never owned a Mazda but it happened to mine,btohqsg
for now i dont fold  but since i sometimes park at tight spaces  i sked people hit it,btohqsg
Yeah  sometimes if you practice protective parking  need to fold to be able to open the door a bit more to get out easily,btohqsg
Lucky you go ask Ur Mother. See if can help.,btohqsg
okay will try to help Ur mother  will search online.,btohqsg
Why ur nick and is like this?,btohqsg
ohh no la just for jokes ah,btohqsg
No problem at all even if it’s a common failure. Doesn’t mean for a sec that it is an unreliable car. 👍🏼,btohqsg
nah nah  not saying its unreliable ah  i just abit ocd,btohqsg
its just buggin me that the one side cnt fold,btohqsg
I am helping Ur mother not you,btohqsg
@Jingxunnpls help Ur Mother. Not me.,btohqsg
Yeah  will look very odd too.,btohqsg
understood  not helping you. just Ur mother.,btohqsg
No he means help Ur mother,btohqsg
It’s a known common issue for the 6. I think it’s some plastic component giving way over time,btohqsg
wont exactly say jammed all the time   it just it cannot fold fully or open fully,btohqsg
Need to push a bit for the whole movement to complete right?,btohqsg
yeaa the workshop i went to ask says that but idk whether plastic anot,btohqsg
I want to help Ur Mother too.,btohqsg
no need  i help Ur mother can already :),btohqsg
like uk the switch to open and close? if stuck right  i constantly switch off and on to open the mirror HAHHAHAHHA,btohqsg
Make sure there is no foreign object which is causing obstruction in its full movement range.,btohqsg
Some complain of the mirrors constantly trying to fold even after it has folded  just keeps clicking non stop,btohqsg
Is that Toyota Altis promo good? Looking at Corolla Altis now. Also considering Mazda 3 Elegance variant .,btohqsg
Ah yes  when the workshop opens the mirror assembly  check for something stuck first before replacing with new part,btohqsg
idt there is a fod there but imma checkk,btohqsg
If it can stay and you want to save on the repairs  you can just leave it opened permanently. If it’s having issues of constantly folding or opening then will need to get it replaced. I had a friend that maintains it by spray WD40 every once in awhile but I don’t know how effective it really is,btohqsg
if you are the drive A to B type of person  go for the altis. if you are a guy who likes to drive  then the mazda is for u! but right  the 1.5 litre engine abit underwhelmingg,btohqsg
I would recommend the Mazda 3 if you're looking for some extra tech as well. Point A to B  simple no nonsense requirement  can go for Altis directly!,btohqsg
i saw one guy on yt he also use the WD40 method  i wanna try but idk if will make it worse or anot  so imma just seek advice firstt HAHA,btohqsg
Wah first time you’re agreeing with Ur Mother.,btohqsg
Thank you Mr Anwo  it's very easy to agree with Ur Mother actually  makes good points,btohqsg
That would be my first guess too,btohqsg
I want to talk more with Ur Mother,btohqsg
Why u want to let pple make fun of your mother?,btohqsg
I haven't checked Mazda 3 price  but if comparing the Altis promo price vs SGCarmart price for M3  Altis is cheaper,btohqsg
Today is Love Ur Mother Day.,btohqsg
"no broo  cos i still studying in poly. so if like my teammates need to get my tele name to msg ah  i can say simply reply ""ur mother"". the reaction funny broo AHAHHAHA",btohqsg
wah surprising cos i thought sg have toyota tax too. i think the M3 is a better buy if you are willing to stretch your budget because the tech and material feel is better  in my opinion.,btohqsg
I suggest all should listen to Ur Mother.,btohqsg
Mazda can negotiate a bit  even when there is no offer  they are open to negotiate. Have a few friends who got elegance trims at the price of the classic,btohqsg
U poly student… the car got your biz??? If your mother so rich and good to buy u Mazda… u put hour mother here for pple to makeFun of???,btohqsg
car guys all very serious one🤣🤣,btohqsg
i just want joke abittt 😩,btohqsg
okok relax haha  not ur mother no worries,btohqsg
I think most mothers are really good and selfless for children … joke about some chicks lah,btohqsg
Yupp  just need to go spend time there  negotiate  ask freebies  higher over trade. Need to work on getting a good deal,btohqsg
okok i change it in a bit,btohqsg
Everyone is a nice guy nice husband until u bring their mother in,btohqsg
dont spread hate  spread le... xus love❤️❤️,btohqsg
No one can take that away from you.,btohqsg
that is good to hear. btw  is it ture Totota always provide just 1 year servicing?,btohqsg
because in the roadshow  they give additional 2 years sevicing  so 3 years in total  when I asked not 5 years? they were so proud saying toyota is always having 1 year,btohqsg
Most jap car ADs will throw in a free service or two. Usually most people cannot get to more than 2 services in a year at max unless doing phv or going cross country everyday,btohqsg
i thought AD is always having 5 years. Maybe I'm wrong,btohqsg
i not sure about toyota ah  but mazda right  standard is 3 years servicing. u can add another 2 years if you want but at a cost ah,btohqsg
idk how the math adds up but yeaa just sharing,btohqsg
Math aside  some also prefer AD service and general feel of their facilities. Like free coffee etc.,btohqsg
somemore if ad right  you can ensure that the job done is of top notch quality,btohqsg
Some didn’t even wait for Mother to come already leggo liao,btohqsg
previously looking at Avente  they are having 5 years  I think that is why i had that impression AD are all 5 years,btohqsg
Nopeeee  if they give you 5 years free  how to earn money hahah. 5 years of warranty is more common,btohqsg
BMW is 5 years warranty n service,btohqsg
you are right  that is the thing I mixed up,btohqsg
Food for thought  Mother: if ADs are so great  why are there so many external workshops surviving and surviving well at that.,btohqsg
Already paid for it when you bought the car,btohqsg
This one really depends on the AD  some are not good at all and will just throw parts in without fixing the issue,btohqsg
because is cheaperr ah  thats what i can think off,btohqsg
Warrently 4-8 years Depent on what lol,btohqsg
Ya for the plus package even battery is free only need change tyre,btohqsg
Merc 10 year warranty for engine and gearbox but they charge exorbitantly hign prices for the service and you need to go to the AD for the warranty to hold up,btohqsg
In the end you become a cash cow for them,btohqsg
That how they maintain the nice as show room hehe,btohqsg
That why many under warranty keep stock,btohqsg
And ppl like me looking at second hand car now,btohqsg
Depent on modelLa  uncle like me also stock my car lol,btohqsg
U ask those uncleDriving e class and s class mod,btohqsg
if they charge low. all their towkay customers won't have the rich feel,btohqsg
They ask u mod what lol,btohqsg
I seen some e / s class mod to become maybach lookalike.,btohqsg
is Apple CarPlay or Android Auto necessary? I saw Corolla Altis don't have this feature,btohqsg
Ya but not much such in sg lol  c and a class a lot of mods la haha,btohqsg
The older u get the more stock,btohqsg
Most uncle just drive stock and change new car,btohqsg
Stock his last Merc s class stock,btohqsg
All these are uncle car ma,btohqsg
My in law family all driving bmw,btohqsg
I got a uncle friend driving s400   he drive me car once and come back ask me   u Siao Lang is it   this car so bumpy and fast for what haha,btohqsg
this one boils down to u sirr  for instance  if uw to use spotify right  like the interface itself  then the carplay all will be usefull,btohqsg
If you like to use navigation on your phone yes  as it makes life easier. Otherwise no need  Bluetooth for calls and music is enough for me,btohqsg
even Mazad just has wired. I saw just Aente is all wireless,btohqsg
I would use wired even if wireless is available because need to charge phone mah. Use carplay or android auto will drain battery  wired will keep charging,btohqsg
Also for wired carplay  can buy dongle on Lazada for 10 to 15 dollars and turn into wireless,btohqsg
I change to jdm I will change my hu,btohqsg
The Mazda wired carplay not bad  the infotainment is quite slick actually,btohqsg
Yah  i like the heads-up display and 360 cam on M3,btohqsg
The tech and materials are really good  I don't think anything in that price bracket and segment is close to it,btohqsg
Mild hybrid tech is also very smooth,btohqsg
A friend of mine was able to get a realistic figure of 14 to 15km/l,btohqsg
You can also consider the Kia cerato as a middle ground between the Altis and the Mazda 3. Really good balance offered in terms of quality and tech with that too. Good price as well,btohqsg
did't look at Kia  but I did check on Avente,btohqsg
Very similar actually  I just prefer the design language on the cerato. Slightly cheaper too,btohqsg
just the new Avente's look is too much to me,btohqsg
I think a good day out at Leng Kee will be beneficial. Can visit all 4 brands and look at the deals that they are offering,btohqsg
I agree  the avante is a bit polarising. Cerato is essentially the same car underneath but easier on the eyes,btohqsg
avante is very easy to spot at night.,btohqsg

Hiya all just hoping for some advice - does number of owner really affect resale value? Like if i am 4th owner.. next time want to trade in or sell will kena lowball alot?,btohqsg
trade in usually no effect at all. for own sale as direct owner can be a factor people will consider  you can consign instead as it gives buyers slightly more confidence than buying from a direct owner at times.,btohqsg
Trade in ADs only care for paper value and what you are buying  they will offer and over-trade above your paper value+body value. For used car dealers  they usually only care for the car condition and paper value as well,btohqsg
I use wireless android but charge using a fast speed charge.. my hu can only supply 1 or 1.5a. Too slow,btohqsg
Based on my recent selling experience. For direct sales you can also consider the SGCarMart auction sale  a bit more convenient than consigning if you would like that,btohqsg
GetGo adds the all-electric Ioniq 5 into its car sharing fleetGetGo will be adding the all-electric Ioniq 5 into its car sharing fleet  but initial models will only be available in Jurong West.West side best side?➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Oh  so basically doesnt matter if im the 4th owner if i am going to trade in.. got it thanks very much for the advice!!,btohqsg
But if the car is like 6 years old ppl might think it an lemon,btohqsg
Yeah i thought so too  but can go own workshop to check if lemon before buying to ease worry?,btohqsg
Also depends on the reason for high owner count  sometimes high because of plate transfers. Others because car has passed through a group of friends who have enjoyed for short periods of time each.,btohqsg
but with a trade in or dealer sale  usually no issues. They buy and sell everyday and know how to tell if a car is a decent unit or not,btohqsg
At least most of them do,btohqsg
I usuallly buy car under wife name and when selling can use careful lady owner,btohqsg
I usually just have a plush toy just for this kind of situation. no need so complicated,btohqsg
I also got a lot of toys in the car,btohqsg
I even got some nice and cute sticker,btohqsg

Actually maid are very poor thing,btohqsg
ya poor thing.u see a lot rich men limo very shiny n clean. they tekan maid to wash every few days.,btohqsg
wash car damn tired . underwear also wet,btohqsg
Actually maids are not supposed to be washing cars,btohqsg
Duties such as gardening  car washing  repair work and tutoring are not considered domestic work and are thereforenot allowed. The Ministry of Manpower offers some examples of restricted maid duties  including cooking for her employer's food business  working in a food stall  or working in her employer's shop.,btohqsg
Actually rich man treat maid better   those not well to do 1 hire a maid take care of elder and kids   no off days like working for long hours,btohqsg

the only time i drove fit is at the driving school HAHHAHA dont know how it feels like when driving above 70kmph,btohqsg
i drive mazda daily. it is great. i can also drive in a sporty manner and it handles quite well too.  real nice sporty sound when pushed hard,btohqsg
but nothing beats the V8 sound mann,btohqsg
and it is fuel saving. ~13 kh/liter. the m3 is sigh. only 6.5 km/liter,btohqsg
in terms of sound yeah. intoxicating. strange when i drive it  other cars dont want to come close to me.,btohqsg
they all keep a distance. but i dont floor,btohqsg
sadan would be real nice and practical,btohqsg
best of both world  i agree!,btohqsg
tomorrow i will take it on highway blast and record using the M analyzer,btohqsg
oh wait the e90 gen came with it??,btohqsg
that gadget can record telemetry and videos,btohqsg
trying to catchup with@bbfasingaporeto get tesla next  if possible,btohqsg
Really u should try   fit us zippy and the handling is kinda sharp   come with small wheel   light weight and a small engine   when u do bend at 80Km u feel like the car is flying off   and straight road once u floor to 100 kmU feel like the engine is over work   but it fun  easy to park   easy to drive and fc is so good,btohqsg
want to enter his league of pedal flooring gang tesla,btohqsg
how fast have you drive your tesla?,btohqsg
Last time I drive fit   I felt that petrol is free,btohqsg
As the fc is too good,btohqsg
that means you have progressed and become orang kaya,btohqsg
from fit to mini s to lexus to tesla,btohqsg
your mazda mirror folds okay now?,btohqsg
feeling mcm same to ice or diff world,btohqsg
focus on driving. not your mirrors,btohqsg
Actually I drive fit for 6 weeks as a replacement car,btohqsg
never go shop yet broo  one day ah,btohqsg
Driving a tesla model 3 performance  u feel everything around u is so slow,btohqsg
Some time u wonder if they even move,btohqsg
damnnnnnn  hopefullly one day i can try,btohqsg
how much was it when u buyy?,btohqsg
hmmm  is just the fast acceleration oni ah?,btohqsg
Felt like a road bully some time if driving aggressively  I bought 249K before road tax,btohqsg
damn. hope you dont regret it siaa,btohqsg
Like the sg carmart reviewer said u felt like a king on the road with that more torque on the wheel   just a small tap is needed to over take,btohqsg
For such performance in sg   it is very cheap,btohqsg
Look at rs3 and m3 price tag,btohqsg
M3 price tag I can get a model s when it out in sg,btohqsg
Ya not even comparable in terms of price just so worth,btohqsg
have you drove it to malaysiaa?,btohqsg
i just dk how people can drive there sia espcially those kampong area where got no charging,btohqsg
like you literally have to go to townside just to charge,btohqsg
Easy just bring own charger   there got industrial charger socket,btohqsg
his tesla is a baby. he baby him,btohqsg
Actually can  there is a person out there on TikTok who took his model 3 all the way to Langkawi. Just need to plan and will probably take longer than ICE as some chargers very slow  need to leave overnight,btohqsg
take your tesla to malaysia and do a youtube for us la. be a man!,btohqsg
Yes unless is 11 kw and above if u have those like 4 kw is like 8 hours,btohqsg
There so many video lioa loll,btohqsg
dont just buy a tesla to floor in front of traffic lights.,btohqsg
Always got meet up and drive to Malaysia,btohqsg

To me I don’t like go long drive if more then 400 and such I will get a petrol car,btohqsg
Hope the new model s battery pack is way better,btohqsg
Don’t know true anot 1000Km give some discount also is 700Km can drive to kl liao,btohqsg
The claimed range on the model S long range is 600km  realistic tests have shown around 450 to 480km with the 19 inch rims  highway driving,btohqsg
Obviously adding city driving will help a lot!,btohqsg
Yes sure need like 30% reduction   due to spirited driving also   tesla changing the 4680Battery and range should go higher,btohqsg
Not just that I guess  EPA testing conditions also have aircon off  tested on empty testing tracks usually where the same speed can be maintained and manufacturers make sure to set the tire pressured etc. to the best possible setup for the actual day and conditions themselves. Across the board not just Tesla so realistic tests are important,btohqsg
Same as car fc ma haha   we know we never achieve that also,btohqsg
Why not? It’s the tiny round button on the driver side door panel.,btohqsg
A lot don’t have auto start stop actually. You can also code it off.,btohqsg
Yep not even comparable. They are two things. Different vehicles  different drive characteristics beyond brochure numbers.,btohqsg
Yup m3 is one of my favorite car  This is actually a good read just sharinghttps://www.topgear.com/car-news/electric/tesla-model-3-vs-bmw-m3-elon-musk,btohqsg
Both good at what they do! I would say that the lap with drifting I would give to the M3 😁😁 because more fun to drift hahah,btohqsg
Take note of the price difference is near I Thier cointry   Singapore price difference is just so hige,btohqsg
Interesting read but cannot compare bah. Like you would never compare an SUV to a sedan as an apple to apple comparison. Same way  both different purpose and different target groups,btohqsg
But Mazda 3 best  no need to change transmission fluid or service you know. Very reliable,btohqsg

Can you record the 7 bars too please?,btohqsg
I buying paste on my car,btohqsg
Not going to fix? Everyday you see the alert no wonder you feel that way sir. Unreliable is if you change that sensor  and very shortly after  that same sensor fails again.,btohqsg
that video is recorded weeks ago,btohqsg
u fix this . few month another light come up... reality of conti..must accept esp a old one.,btohqsg
just to show you the shift lights. late ri will record another one without those christmas lights,btohqsg
oxygen sensor changed when car is just one year old!,btohqsg
Almost apple to apple .. his is an E92 M3 which is a high performance car. even his onboard computer processor mss60 i think (or was it mss65) was legend. capable of handling massive loads of data from sensors around the car including suspension inputs  and capable of continuous adjustments of the car parameters,btohqsg
That why the sticker is nice,btohqsg
this is s85 - 2 cylinders. see this incredible machinehttps://youtu.be/6_LRuAgOAMc,btohqsg
so.. with all due respect to other cars  this has a lot of sensors for good reason and with climate  wear and tear  it is part of maintenance to replace them especially on the usual ductings  pipings  connectors  gaskets after some years,btohqsg
fantastic sound just like the v8.,btohqsg
Wow that V10…… what a screamer 😍😍,btohqsg

Hi community members I have this catalyst system problem that result in check engine sign pop up every 2-3 days after I erased them. Anyone has encountered before and where and the cost of rectifying?,btohqsg
I have cleaned the exhaust pipe and change the filter  still same result,btohqsg
What part of the exhaust have you changed?,btohqsg
I have done it in Singapore and Malaysia workshop  they said catalytic converter. But I am not so sure,btohqsg
Something like this  but no cure,btohqsg
Maybe get your cat converter checked by an independent here. Usually just need to use cat con cleaner and can be done with it. If not  need to change sensor,btohqsg
Or remove your cat. Problem solved plus more power 😆 just beware of inspection,btohqsg
Sensor changed after 2-3 days check engine sign still pop up,btohqsg
Ya the msia workshop said in msia all have them removed. But spore inspection sure fail,btohqsg
Make sure they changed your cat to a new one and cleaned out the pipes a bit in the process,btohqsg
Yupp because removing cat con can make your exhaust sound significantly better and has some performance gains too,btohqsg
I had mine removed last time  passed inspection. Now probably very strict,btohqsg
Afternoon! Is there anyway to check if a car was previously used as PHV?,btohqsg
Not so sure he change what. any bro know a sure cure workshop?,btohqsg
I spent a few hundred still not yet solved,btohqsg
But what if they change carplate number,btohqsg
+once the car is deregged as a phv  it won't show up,btohqsg
Recommend you to ask for service records in case mileage is high  can see service intervals that way which will have the mileage at each service. Can judge accordingly if it was serviced very very frequently or not,btohqsg
Thanks for the URL but it will not be listed once its removed/deregistered. Was wondering if I have missed out on any information. Thanks again! As for mileage  issue is the tweaking of mileage. Service records  also hard to judge since user/owner can tweak mileage before going back to the workshop. Really all odds against the buyer of used cars. Not easy.,btohqsg
The usual advise of skip used car dealers that don't allow workshop inspection. Skip used car dealers that require deposit because hard to get back if don't go through. While these are sound advice  the reality of being able to do these  with the used car dealers are far fetched. 0 out 3 today.,btohqsg
Well  you can always do an inspection to check if the miles are accurate or not  many mechanics can tell basis the actual condition of parts such as suspension  control arms  etc. Another way to judge by yourself is interior condition  but this is a bit harder for cars with PU leather as it doesn't age the same way. Can also look at how the dealer is  many dealers and areas with dealers are known to be notorious for Odo tampering. Also most phv drivers don't care to reverse the Odo before every service so if you can check  you will be able to see how regular the intervals were and figure out,btohqsg
It really depends on how hard you look  I have dealt with a few used car dealers in the recent past and they were happy to oblige to any inspection requests of mine/transparent in their deals. Any dealer that felt shady  just walk away,btohqsg
Yes. Guess more legwork required! 😝,btohqsg
change oil one year later! 12000 km.,btohqsg
Unless you buys car models which PHV drivers willl surely not use to drive as PHV one 😅😅,btohqsg
Still possible bro. Can look some more. Have faith 😁,btohqsg

Carista has the wireless one which is quite neat actually.,btohqsg

Hi all any mk7.5 golf 1.4 owner here? Want to ask if it is normal for abit of acceleration lag? Test drove one over the weekend but like not very responsive until i step hard then will shoot forward and start accelerating,btohqsg
Tested the audi 1.0 also  thought would be less powerful but was surprisingly more responsive than the golf haha,btohqsg
haha maybe the turbo lag abit more evident then other cars  its a common issue for many cars around the world:),btohqsg
Next time la when I back after 14 days maybe can kopi,btohqsg
But thought audi and vw share same engine  should behave the same except audi maybe less power since 1.0? Haha,btohqsg
Then u can try floor and vtec kick in yoz,btohqsg
maybe the vw whack too much... all loose liao...,btohqsg
Not all the time  also the 1.0 is a newer engine compared to the 1.4. they reduced to turbo lag so you get the power earlier but the 1.4 can hold for longer,btohqsg
The 1.0 in the older a3 and new a1 is the same as a VW polo,btohqsg
1 liter engine road tax how much ar,btohqsg
Can even show off to Honda Fit on the lower road tax,btohqsg
@vseh1also  make sure to pop the car in sport mode or the gearbox into sport mode especially if it's a used car as the previous drivers may not be stepping hard so the TCU has learnt their patterns and has a slower kickdown. In sport  the gearbox will be more responsive.,btohqsg
I’ve never owned VW or Audi. But I test the A4 old models. Non turbo. I feel the engine is kinda coarse. Sounds rough like diesel.,btohqsg
They have come a long way in terms of refinement! Also for the older engines really depends on how they are maintained and cannot compare to newer engines,btohqsg
The EA888 3B is arguably one of the smoothest engines with great tuning potential if desired,btohqsg
I met a female driver of A4 who turned to Lexus is250 I think. She said the Audi A4 is crap!,btohqsg
Another one who owned the Audi A6 bought it new faced so many problems he eventually dumped I to get a Mercedes Benz E200.,btohqsg
Of course i do not know now. Because companies can improve products,btohqsg
But many bad tales from owners who owned Audis,btohqsg

While on bmw a parts guy told me he tested his friend’s Tesla 3 and he says absolutely best feeling.,btohqsg
I asked him if better than bmw driving sensations he says 100%! 😱,btohqsg
Seems that u become tesla fan boy alos,btohqsg
Luckily I’m aint bmw ego maniac. I’ll say what I think is good or bad regardless of brands.  No emotions,btohqsg
I’ve become long ago. As early as 2019. I almost bought in 2021 last year,btohqsg
I was like hoping maybe coe comes down but it decided to go up and up.,btohqsg
Bro I don’t laugh. I admire the product.,btohqsg
Instead I laugh at those who say door gaps don’t fit nicely poor product quality fit finish. They don’t see the bigger picture,btohqsg
okay whats the bigger picture? if a car comes with big panel gaps then quality control is not good.,btohqsg
The bigger picture is the better driving enjoyment and potential for bigger things like Fsd etc,btohqsg
The potential what it can do,btohqsg
Shanghai modeL 3 so far really never got panel gap issue,btohqsg
Maybe those made in Fremont are. Well initially they are like that as techniques get improved these will be non issues,btohqsg
That’s why I want to try out yours. Coffee on me when you’re back.,btohqsg
Can la when I back on the 8 th June afterward,btohqsg
Can kopi and go for a spin,btohqsg
Must be the b8  last year it was sold was late 2015 to 2016. AD was eager to get the units out before the B9 generation landed,btohqsg
I go measure at mw showroom already. Those 2 units also have mah,btohqsg
But if one ignores that and wants the FSD and Tesla hype  good buy 👍,btohqsg
Tesla does have hype  like other brands such as Supreme  Jordan  etc. Tesla does owe a portion of its sales to hype created by Elon and influencers buying and influencing young ones to buy also.,btohqsg
If the product ain’t good hype won’t last. Hype is short term. But the fact is it’s accepted all over the world says they product is good. Even in Germany.,btohqsg
Product is good. But there's better stuff out there :) but I respect if you like it!,btohqsg
china styled wheels are like that  you can guess it,btohqsg
Take a damp cloth  wipe the decal position and see if there's a mark,btohqsg
No use...a cartimes agent went to register a car to clock one ownership then sell me. Even if you key in car plate no. will also not turn up any result.,btohqsg
this sound is hardly emotive. not exciting at allhttps://youtu.be/rj5Kf1Wc0Vo,btohqsg
that means the engine is gone,btohqsg
nothing to do with exhaust. comes from engine.,btohqsg
yeah  my m3 is on stock exhaust too. but sounds glorious,btohqsg
Vincar used car at lengkee  got 1 red in show room. Saw last week,btohqsg
lexus big engine cars a flop.,btohqsg
i think they dont know how to tune,btohqsg
that one have leh... thought they have one model where they employed yamaha sound engineers for its sound notes?,btohqsg
which has become a collector  it is a failed project. but a brilliant machine. fantastic car. 10000 rpm engine i think or is it 9000,btohqsg
"Yup. They have no motivation in life.""The Lost Decade""New Supra just buy over BMW engine.😅Should put in their 3.5L V6 and twin turbo it to fight nissan r35😂👍New lotus using Toyota 3.5L V6 and super charge it😅",btohqsg
yeah man... it is a brilliant machine for sure. best sounding engine consistently on many lists,btohqsg
LFA super nice! Just that it's very limited,btohqsg
Sadly one of them had fallen off a truck as well. It was the highest mile LFA in the world and a trucking company dropped it. Many lots because of sad reasons. But the LFA is a legendary car,btohqsg
I get it purists argue the supra is no longer a toyota. yes there are parts from other makers  but hasn't that been the case for many other cars as well? like mercedes or jaguar engines in Aston Martins  or toyota sourced engines in Lotus.  that does not make a Lotus a Toyota...,btohqsg
the best sounding car in  the world,btohqsg
Just because they sold only 500 because they limited them means it's a failed project?,btohqsg
it is a failed project because it is not successful,btohqsg
What would you define as successful for a car of that stature?,btohqsg
I wouldn't call it a failed project.  It was intended to be rare and bespoke sir.,btohqsg
But it's their most successful sport/race model. GT race.Just like GTR.Can you imagine they use other maker engine.😅,btohqsg
Even the carerra GTs which the LFA is often compared to based on the engine sound had only 1270 units made,btohqsg
They need to hirerThe World Best Marketer to sell it.Logan Paul😂,btohqsg
Hmmm wonder why no one says that about the legendary McLaren F1 that had a BMW engine in it even though McLaren was making their own engines for F1 cars,btohqsg
