Have just started investing in equities in 2021... But the wealth accumulation journey is slow... Is it suppose to be like that... Will need time to grow?,btohqsg
Could someone teach me about how to pay ocbc 360 on paynow Web for salary payment. I couldn't find how to do it thanks,btohqsg
What is slow? It is indeed take years to compound,btohqsg
I don't anyhow spend ... Definitely  will have monthly expenses for house  groceries  parents...,btohqsg
Yes it is supposed to be slow and boring.,btohqsg
If you don’t mind me asking  what were your expectations when you started?,btohqsg
No expectation. Just hope to increase my wealth so that I can have enough money to do renovation of my old house.,btohqsg
I understand it will take years to compound.,btohqsg
I should be patient and have the discipline to do dollar cost averaging...,btohqsg
You will probably need at least 1 general spend card with no cap (the 1.x mpd kind) to soak up the leftoversAlso hsbc revo may not be applicable  have to check MCC against t&c,btohqsg
Maybe you can see if the mcc is on the whitelist for uob kf (+amaze)  then 3mpd no cap (w/ 800 sia grp spend)Or if online  citi smrt?Else gen spending card,btohqsg
just for reference  people take their whole life to build wealth. urgency is how people get burnt,btohqsg
"If you read ocbc website “While there are many ways salary gets credited into an account  only direct salary credits through GIRO with the description ""GIRO - SALARY"" in your statements will qualify for this bonus. Other forms of salary credit such as cheques  cash deposit  fund transfer  etc.  strictly do not qualify for this bonus interest.”",btohqsg
I understand. I never do trading. I just invest in long term only.,btohqsg
My thought  for short but with small returns  can start with high interest saving account and FD. These can help to build the foundation which can used to buy stocks and hold it.,btohqsg
There are earlier posts which mention you need to wait for 10-15 years to see a reasonable return.,btohqsg
But I realise their 3.5% is tiers means I don't really get much interest on the 250k in 6 months,btohqsg
himay i know which card is better for local shopping?,btohqsg
Need to work smart / work hard too  don't just depend on investment  else it's just gambling. you need to build up your capital do that you can effectively manage your risk + diversify.,btohqsg
I personally look down on people who brag to me that they earn a lot from investment only and do nothing else. these group of people bring no value to the society and is actually just a gambler. my opinion only.,btohqsg
can i set up personal giro for it? like from giro from another bank with the same description,btohqsg

That's a good start. Come up with a budget  allocate more to investing and saving (note the difference between saving for a rainy day  which we're talking about VS saving to spend on something  which many are doing).Reduce your wants for your needs. Next thing you can do is to increase your income.,btohqsg

Why not salary credit to OCBC 360 then transfer 1.6k to UOB One?,btohqsg

Equities usually provide returns in excess of inflation. While t-bills and other money market have been earning 3-6% in the past year  global equities have gained about 15-18% in that same time periodT-bills can be considered part of money market also  so it makes sense that they're on the lower end of the money market range as they're considered super safe,btohqsg
Ah yea t bill part of money market,btohqsg

For such independent advisors. Who is your actual agent that services u when u need to submit a claim or have issues 3-5 years later for example.,btohqsg
Can Google and you will find out a list of IFA firms. From there can study what is the firm about  vision and mission etc. Then you ask them to get you an advisor.,btohqsg
IFA. there are firms that can sell mutliple companies but not the GE PRU and AIA,btohqsg
Hi all just to warn everyone about changing the UOB One statement date. I have changed the statement date and realise I did not receive my quarterly UOB One cashback. According to UOB  they say they have combined the statement which means that I do not have 3 consecutive statement of spending,btohqsg
As usual  offset next statement due for cc.,btohqsg
So your new month starts at Jan? Jan to Mar is your new statement quarter  with Dec spending merged into Jan.Similar to my statement change for my UOB EVOL card  they combined the 2 statement months into 1 so I lost 1 month of cashback. But the difference is you'll lose the quarter's cashback if you already hit the requirement in Dec (I'm assuming you changed your statement month because it starts in Dec).But with the new statement quarter (from Jan)  you'll still have Mar to clock before they compute your cashback also.,btohqsg
I changed just to make it easier to tie in with the UOB One account monthly spending. To be honest  I just lose out $50 for the quarter. But it's just not right for UOB to do that. And don't want others to get penalised by UOB,btohqsg
Yes. Working hard in my job. I understand investment in equity is just for long term. Just that because I am new to investment I wonder how long I have to wait only. Though I know is for retirement  human being human we will periodically look at the grow... To see if it is at a desirable rate only. ☺️,btohqsg

when ur card approved? what was your  original statement date?,btohqsg
did they change the interest rate? wasnt it 3.5% for 6 months for entire 250k?,btohqsg
In what way you want to track? The app will show you if you've fulfilled the $1.6k salary credit and $500 card spend requirements. If you're talking about MAB  you can track on excel everyday.,btohqsg
OCBC I can “lock” my money in various savings goals and whatever remaining = excess that I can put towards a “want”Uob don’t have such function  so I’m finding a way to offline this function and ensure I’m setting aside money for my fixed goals eg $300/mth for insurance  personal savings  travel fund  Reno fund etc.,btohqsg

We need to know these funds are not capital guaranteed hence that is why they are willing to give you more returns.,btohqsg
In the long run (we're talking periods of 10 years or more)  you're very likely to beat annualised 2.5% if investing in equities (or even some kinds of fixed income). But then you will also need to have the stomach to hold on when your investment portfolio drops 10-20%  and you know that you could have been getting a guaranteed 2.5% instead,btohqsg

Ai yo...that sad 😔Noted w thanks,btohqsg

hsbc does unless they changed tnc,btohqsg

o wow. so some cards will consider bnpl such as atome as a usual online transaction and not installment? as long as the mcc isnt blacklist is that correct?,btohqsg
Go google article on bnpl  they run different mcc code,btohqsg
Hi  BHS is the Basic Healthcare sum  means cannot exceeed that amount in a given year. and only fixed when we turn age 65  based on cohort level sum.Excess funds from MA will overflow to SA  and if SA hit FRS  it will overflow to OA. (Granted)No Volunteer topping up to MA once BHS reached  any excess amount will be refunded.Assume MA already maxed at current BHS $71 500.Question: During the Mandatory toppping up by employer on a monthly basis. the manadatory contribution still goes to MA When does the overflow take place? 1st January 2025? or on a month on month basis? is there FAQ on this or stated anywhere?,btohqsg
Your second line answered your main question. Overflow immediately.,btohqsg

Not bad idea! If u need endowus sign up let me know. Amundi Prime usa is also not bad with slightly lower fees.,btohqsg
Hi  in how many days it is approved.,btohqsg
Oh thanks  I’ve already signed up actually 😅,btohqsg
1 difference to note about the 2.  I bought both  but I realized my Infinity US500 grew slightly more over the same time period as compared to Amundi Prime USA.,btohqsg
Hi experts  for successful moomoo 6.8% of 50k fresh deposit  if subscription of max 80k (eg. existing plus new fund) has reached in cash plus account  will withdrawing the money (unuse fund not in the cash plus account) back to bank affect the redemption and eligibility?,btohqsg
I see! I assume it’s better to purchase two of the different funds rather than consolidate all my money in one fund right,btohqsg
I haven’t read it research much on amundi  but I’ll check it out,btohqsg
based on endowus website they share the same exact annualised gains of 30.89. But since Amundi is a relative young stock  we don't have much data points to compare it with lion global infinity. Very hard to say about the future also haha,btohqsg
Thank you so much for sharing Shawn & Michael! Will do some research after!,btohqsg
Endowus is not cheap  plan to terminate it,btohqsg
what other options would u suggest for CPF OA investing?,btohqsg
You’re referring to the transaction costs right?,btohqsg
Sorry  you’re referring to this fund fee right  which is 0.33% which will be charged on a quarterly basis based on the gains made right?,btohqsg
Endowus charges platform fees which are on top of the individual fund charges,btohqsg
Fund fees: paid to fund manager (e.g. vanguard) to maintain the fundPlatform fees: paid to Endowus to recommend  rebalance  hold funds  etc.,btohqsg
Myself being an Endowus user since 2020  I think I shall explain how the fees  cashback  transaction cost works based on my cash/srs/cpf portfolios.1) Fund FeesFund fees are already accounted for in the NAV price of the unit trust  so you don't really see the effect of it unless you compare 2 unit trusts that has similar holdings i.e. one has higher fund fees than the other - net earnings reduced marginally.2) CashbackThe good thing about Endowus is that cashback (trailer fee) is returned to us as retail investors. Other platforms like FSMOne  iFast  even the banks keep these trailer fees  and they earn them! Some banks charge 'sales charge'. In the end your earnings are reduced. How the cashback is calculated by Endowus - They take the average invested amount of the portfolio for each quarter  and they return it back to you  i.e. back to your cash account in Endowus (for cash) or to your cpf oa/srs associated with your chosen bank agent (for cpf/srs).3) Transaction CostCash/srs no issue. You do lump sum or DCA  no transactional costs. For cpf  unfortunately the charge lies with the bank (DBS/UOB/OCBC) and not Endowus. Hence for those who wish to invest your cpf oa  it is best that your lump sum or DCA is a bigger amount to make sure that your $2+ fees deducting your cpf oa is worth it.4) Platform FeesEndowus did state the percentage amount for their various portfolios. If fund smart (single fund)  fee is reduced to 0.3%. Not to forget there is a 9% gst fee on top of that. What endowus does is either deduct from your cash account (for cash) if there is some money there  or if not  redeem from your portfolio (for cash/cpf/srs) by selling some units from your unit trust.Hope my explanation helps.,btohqsg
I see! Thanks for the explanation Shawn! ☺️,btohqsg

For me  if it opens additional ways of generating passive income. For now  I will exploring investing in money market or income funds.,btohqsg
Honestly would advice against using SA to invest if you're planning to. Only 40% gets above OA (not SA) 2.5% but it's hard to beat risk free 4%.,btohqsg
The video is focused on the additional 1% interest on cumulative 60k.,btohqsg

Hi all  can I check if the average daily balance calculation and monthly average balance calculation are the same? You are taking the sum of the balance in the month/number of calendar days,btohqsg
Yes. Sum of end of day balances divide by number of days in month.,btohqsg
For uob one account  can i fulfill lvl 2 then fulfill lvl 1? Cos i put my salary in first then hit $500 and the app says i hit lvl 1 only,btohqsg
For SC credit card users  do you pay the outstanding balance or the due ? My outstanding balance is lower than the due and the difference is exactly my cashback amount.,btohqsg
Follow statement... high chance should be paying ur outstanding,btohqsg
The sequence is not important. But you definitely must fufill both within the same month to gain the bonus interest. If you only fufill lvl 2 requirement  then you will not get the bonus interest from lvl 2 as lvl 1 requirement is the pre-requisite.,btohqsg
Thanks for confirming. I shall monitor for afew more days as my app shows i hit lvl 1 when i have done both,btohqsg
UOB will take around 2 days to update and it may delay with weekends. Especially for the $500 credit card spending  get it done asap before that and not on the last day.,btohqsg

If it is not in UOB Evol exclusion list  yes it is an online transaction because the transaction is done on an online platform and Apple Pay is a payment mode supported by the online platform,btohqsg

What is the reason that u dont book from scoot directly,btohqsg
wow pre covid times i always buy 20kg for $23. now price doubled... crazy...,btohqsg
iirc it will be 45$  i remember that trip or whatver has markup,btohqsg
if you scared can buy those penny stock  the last time i brought something a few cents only,btohqsg
Ok. Tks. I will take look.,btohqsg
but those penny stock   will have low volume   so u can consider it as a loss. And if yours is by trade count  then buy the penny stock x 1 for whatever the trading count requirement is,btohqsg
but isn't scoot price the same as other websites ?,btohqsg
No leh i seetrip.comprice about $100 cheaper than scoot,btohqsg
Then u give and take loh  cant have all the goodies de mah,btohqsg
the tickets intrip.comare provided by third party agencies. It could be cheaper cos they purchased in bulk. But do note the risk is if there are any issues like flight delays  cancellations  you have to go to the agencies and not scoot.,btohqsg

I don’t touch the account except to transfer out the interest for the month. So usually the balance remains the same.,btohqsg
you move out the interest in whole down to the last cent? did u leave any small bits?I'm just thinking is there a possibility the small base interest credited on the last day of the month could have messed u upespecially since feb base interest is less than jan base interest,btohqsg
should be in..i guess your MAB fell short..,btohqsg
Best is end of day everyday track then can compare against previous month..,btohqsg
U can login to ur UOB web account  it tells you your MAB in the last 3 months.Let us know what you find.,btohqsg
Which date n What time you transfer out the January base interest n bonus interest respectively? Is it same day it was credited before 9pm?,btohqsg
transfer out same day interest is credited before 10.30pm in Jan and feb?,btohqsg
my guess is because End Jan is bigger than End Feb interest.. it messed up..For example ($100 000 + $5) > ($100 000 + $4) MAB,btohqsg
Man.. all that work for 3% p.a.,btohqsg

i have just recently switched from ocbc360 to uob one account  should i wait till one year mark (of owning the ocbc365 card) then cancel? are there consequences for cancelling before the one year mark,btohqsg
$600 in calendar month based on transaction date,btohqsg
I don't think there is. Ppl sometimes just cancel immediately.,btohqsg
i think if you want to buy   should read the policy documents   tnc etc,btohqsg
cause like some ILP (investment linked plans) OR savings plan etc theres a lot of fees,btohqsg
So buying investments from banks  the main concern is the high fees involved right? So what % is considered high or normal? (Sorry i am very noob in investments  hope can have help from gurus here),btohqsg
Just think of it this way. Imagine you have a guaranteed returns of 4% p.a.  but the fees are 3.5% p.a.  you will end up only earning 0.5% p.a.Then imagine the returns are non-guaranteed. 🤡The base advice is to read through the t&c  find out the fees  and see if it works for you.,btohqsg
ILPs are probably the best way to demonstrate this lol,btohqsg
"I do hear banks charge a higher fee than other platforms..So if my banker  who is my relative can reduce the fee to very low %  then it means its worth considering right?So its not a sure ""no no from banks"" like some people has answered?Or is there any other cons of taking from banks that i should also look out for?",btohqsg
Maribank or funds do they charge such high fees?,btohqsg
The very simple qn is  what does the tnc say?,btohqsg
There may be other terms that are disadvantage to you like early withdrawal. If the fund they recommend can be purchased through 3rd party platforms like poems or moomoo  you should consider using these platforms and you have flexibility how many  when and how to do it. Unless the fund is managed by the bank directly. Ex: United SG Fund by UOB where you can use their UOB Investapp to purchase direct their fund.,btohqsg
Currently what's the best place to invest?,btohqsg
Oh for now it's 0.125% pa as fees.,btohqsg
Maybe can start with this videohttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/176828,btohqsg

can  check that you have chosen the right default card linked to Amaze card before the transaction  enabled the right payment settings of the Amaze card in instarem app.,btohqsg

Hey guys !Is it me or the DBS yuu card is underrated?I mean getting around 73$ for spending 600$ a month on Guardian  cold storage  giant ..sounds pretty good dealI am using UOB one card and i was thinking that DBS yuu kind of offers better cashbackAny thoughts?,btohqsg
If your only spending is yuu merchants and you can hit $600  yuu is better.But UOB one cc meets the UOB one account requirements and high cashback on DFI/ public transport. For most general spend also 3.33%. Depends on your spending patterns,btohqsg
Hello all! Which digital bank has the best interest rate for idle cash now? Mari still? Thanks in advance~,btohqsg

May I check which of the following Giro do not work for UOB One account 1. HDB season carpark2. TC Service Charge3. Pacific Lights charges4. SP servicesIs there a min. charge required for the GIRO payment like $50?Thank you.,btohqsg
btw $500 card spend+ 3x giro only qualify for lower bonus interest  should do $500 card spend + salary crediting (FAST from other bank  choose purpose as salary crediting),btohqsg
Yes I am awared of that.Do you mean can ignore 3x Giro if we can meet $500 card spend + Salary Crediting alone?,btohqsg
Some of the terms have been improved over time.  Currently:Card spend 500 fulfills Level 1;3 GIRO “OR” Salary credit will get you Level 2(NOTE: much higher interests with Salary Credit though - see the relevant posts by Trazora following this thread)GIRO - including setting up your own UOB cards to pay monthly minimum payment through GIROAnd you get this screen on the UOB app to track.  UOB has done a great job to make it very clear now -,btohqsg
Where to see this in the apps,btohqsg
but GIRO gives a lower bonus interest than salary crediting although both are level 2,btohqsg
Thank you  Trazora  for pointing this crucial point out!You are absolutely right on this important point.  Thank you for also providing the screenshot!I am glad that I have been maintaining the salary credit on UOB all this while and completely forgot the difference 😅,btohqsg
From the App > Accounts > One Account > you will be at the “Transactions” tab at this point > switch to the “Details” tab on the left > look for the “Interest tracker” and expand the “View activities”Hope this helps,btohqsg
Hi Rose. Appreciate your sharing. Thanks to Trazora as well. I am not sure the $500 card spend tracking is actually including the qualifying spend for the cashback? I am new to this and I tried to calculated the posted transactions and it does not tally up with the tracked amount.,btohqsg
It is my experience that the Card Spend qualifying for One Account interest and the Card Spend for credit card rebates have difference exclusions.For example  insurance premium can satisfy the One Account interest but not credit card rebates.You really need to read the Exclusions t&c (on the Credit Card side) closely if you intend to use the same spend for both sides.,btohqsg
$500 card spend for bonus interest is qualified spend posted in calendar month  summed across eligible cards uob one/evol/lady/debit cardsIf u talking about uob one cc  it is based on $500/$1000/$2000 qualified spend and min 5 transactions posted in each and all of the 3 statement months that makes up your qualifying quarter.If your statement month follows calendar month and u only have uob one card  the $500 spend for bonus interest is effectively same as that for uob one rebate  except that insurance is counted to count spend for bonus interest but not card rebate.,btohqsg
Yeah. I know all these. But I couldn't understand why not tally. I only use uob one cc and didn't use it to pay insurance. Maybe need to wait later of the day to fully reflected for just posted transactions?,btohqsg
Lady’s card won’t need to worry all this right? Just see tracker enough alr?,btohqsg
Is the current BOC uncapped miles card worth it?,btohqsg

Is it just me or does one motoring not accept any paypal payment anymore ? Normally  I use my Amex card on paypal to pay for onemotoring fine but now there isnt such option.,btohqsg
Hence my question too…. Currently BOC Offers uncapped 7-8mpd on local and overseas respectively,btohqsg
No TnC as I received it via SMS. I not taking part is this coz if I’m not one of the 1st few  spending on such cards will incur 3.25% dynamic conversion fee. But alas  I guess if u signed up  they should tell u if u qualify or not before u actually proceed to spend. So if u need to spend overseas  sure go ahead and sign up but get acknowledgment 1st,btohqsg
Best to tally every transaction yourself with Excel  down to if the transaction is posted or not,btohqsg
Hi gurus  is there a way to check uob lady’s card’s selected bonus categories on uob app,btohqsg

Ya i know lol..i was trying to explore what POEMS can offer and how it works  then realise there are acct opening rewards  so I am thinking why not.. 😅,btohqsg
Yeah  for me Agoda  grab and singlife,btohqsg
Hello everyone  i'm new to the credit card scene and recently just signed up for the Citi Premier Miles as i wanted to clock miles that doesn't expire!Does anyone know what's a good overseas card to pair this Citi card with? Instarem? Revolut?Youtrip? 😬,btohqsg
assume it is master card  pair it with Instarem,btohqsg
thank you for your advice! 🤗,btohqsg
but instarem rate is a bit higher like 1.5-2%  CPM mpd is not so high,btohqsg
usually people pair with Citi Reward for 4mpd,btohqsg
hmmmm right! So it's better if get the Citi Rewards card in this case?,btohqsg
citi rewards miles expire in 5 years block,btohqsg
oh ya!!! Cos i'm just thinking how can i fully maximise the CPM card when i'm overseas as well!,btohqsg
i would rather use citi rewards + amaze instead of CPM   CPM the MPD not worth it,btohqsg
but i realised that Citi rewards is good if i'm constantly shopping online every month + taking grab most of the time. Else if i don't do this  it doesn't really help in my situation right!,btohqsg
so for how citi rewards + amaze card works is that   amaze will convert everything to online spendingSo thats why people call it CRMC + amaze combo,btohqsg
righttttt! yes i did see on the youtube videos before that honey money made!,btohqsg
so even tapping your amaze card for paywave  it will be converted to online spending,btohqsg
so is it safe to say that if i were to have CRMC + amaze together  every paywave i do i just have to use the amaze card to clock online spending?,btohqsg
Wow thank you guys so much for the inputs! Helps alot! One last question  will you guys pair the CRMC + Amaze (for day to day spending)  as well as CPM (for overseas spending eg  hotels/flight tickets etc) to maximise earning miles? 😁,btohqsg
CRMC will not earn for travel  incl hotel,btohqsg
so CPM will cover for that right!,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  any suggestion for upcoming t bill competitive bid yield? Thanks,btohqsg
Bid at the rate u can accept? If u cannot accept anything at 3.49 and below  then bid 3.5. If for some reason u jus wan to get it no matter wat  then jus put 1%.,btohqsg
will not use CPM for hotel/flight,btohqsg

ohhhh what will you use for that!,btohqsg
how about the normal UOB Lady's card if i'm unable to apply for Solitaire!,btohqsg
for travel / hotel spending i would rather use some other cards to clock that spendingCPM too meh already,btohqsg
cos i applied for both CPM and CRMC now and i'm confused what to do with CPM alr HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Use it for free lounge lol,btohqsg
CPM just keep it there  after 6 month / 1 year cancel,btohqsg
will there be any charges if i were to cancel?,btohqsg
early cancellation yes  i think most card early cancel is 6 mths,btohqsg
so if i were to hold it for 1 year shouldn't be an issue right  just scared if i don't use the CPM and they charge me the annual fee and i am not able to waive it off,btohqsg
normally will waive off   as you are using the CRMC alsoIf cant waive off just cancel,btohqsg
Keep for priority pass lorh or Citi Payall,btohqsg
Can just keep CPM for 2 free priority pass visits,btohqsg
that's what i was thinking as well!,btohqsg
but do get another card for hotel / flight expenses,btohqsg
which will be the UOB lady's card right since it's 6mpd,btohqsg
6mpd until end of this month only. Back to 4mpd in April. Still better than most cards.,btohqsg
Any suggestions on other cards for hotels/airplane tickets that i can possibly get!,btohqsg
i dont like UOB ladies because of this :UNI$ expire 2 years from the last day of each periodic quarter in which the UNI$ was earned. Each UNI$ period is calculated commencing from January to December of each calendar year. Expired UNI$ cannot be replaced or reinstated.,btohqsg
What are you keeping UNI$ more than 2 years for?,btohqsg
before the end of the 2yrs expiry u can transfer into KF for an extra 3yrs expiry date  making it a total of 5yrs,btohqsg
"cause my spending is not that high to clock enough uni$ for something ""good""",btohqsg
"I dunno your situation but need to be aware of what spending you do to make any meaningful return whether cashback or miles.With that said  it's a myth that one needs to have high spending to get something ""good"". The game is about being aware of spending and optimizing that spend.",btohqsg
cause currently for my case  i am spending on evol 600$ a monthany extra would be directed to my CRMC AMAZE. I rarely have any hotel / flight expenses. which CRMC amaze will cover my ass more   as i tend to eat out / buy stuff from shopee / lazada,btohqsg
cause i also thought of spending 25$ to transfer the miles over to my KF account  if the miles amount is too little. then spending 25$ to transfer that little amount of miles is not that worth it,btohqsg
yes i transfer mine over when it hits a minimum of 25kUNI$ only,btohqsg
i barely spend 1k a year in hotel / flights   so in my case not as worth it to get the uob ladies. i would rather go with a more generic card like hsbc revo,btohqsg
The beauty of uob card is that it pull together all uob miles card,btohqsg
Any tips for this situation? Cos I would maybe only travel 2-3 times a year  sometimes even lesser! Not sure if like what wz shared  might defeat the purpose of UOB Lady’s card!,btohqsg
actually i just read that uob ladies  travel category includes flights + hotels  so actually can consider it,btohqsg
so technically i can haveEVOL  (day to day use )CRMC + AMAZE  ( after exceeding EVOL)UOB LADY card  ( for hotel / flights expenses only),btohqsg
you need to reframe your question.You want card that can cover your hotel/airplane ticket purchase or you want card that earns points/cashback for your spends to reach your goal? Whatever that may be.See the big picture first and then see where your spends are  then cover those.,btohqsg
I’m leaning more towards cards that can maximise the points! So sorry for the vague question! 😅,btohqsg
i not sure if your expenditure is the same as mine  my monthly spend is usually between 600$ - 1k. but this is based on my spending habits also,btohqsg
I think can watch this video first then gather your thoughtshttps://youtu.be/T0dtcQXhDXs?si=y8VzekKZ_Us93m4C,btohqsg
Got it thank you so much! 🙏🏻 really appreciate it!,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to know if open SRS and deposit $500 monthly while doing investment  good enough for retirement? Let say I can invest for at least 20 years…Only have limited capital..Do I still need to buy annuity from insurance?,btohqsg
Depends on how much you think you need for retirement.My own opinion herehttps://youtu.be/lnI5hSC8jhE,btohqsg
if you are only using lady card for hotel and flight expenses only  will you reach minimum points to redeem? That's something you need to consider.so again I'd go back to see the goal  and then see where the spends lie  then optimize that. 👍,btohqsg
Conrad centennial and Conrad orchard which one nicer? Who stay before can share?,btohqsg
anyone knows if i paid my income tax too early  does it matter?,btohqsg
Anyone used tiger broker new debit card? How is it? How the 1% tsla shares is being calculated?,btohqsg
Gahmen thanks you for topping up their account early,btohqsg
okay cos i forgot to acknowledge the form for filing before paying,btohqsg
its just $100😂 after the 50% disc,btohqsg
oh  before you submit the NOA is it? Not sure about that...I always pay early after generating the NOA because just get it done and over with,btohqsg
Is it worth signing up for tiger broker debit card?,btohqsg
nope if u alr have a credit card to charge your spending,btohqsg
i got preview the NOA but i didnt click submit,btohqsg
If don’t have? Still worth signing up?,btohqsg
tbh no in my opinion. there are better debit cards out there,btohqsg
+1. Unless you fancy getting your cashback in TSLA shares  there are other cards that give 1% cashback in cold hard cash,btohqsg
Anyone has unknown transactions charged to your ichange account recently? My sgd balance has gone negative today,btohqsg
😮 possible  for debit card balance to go negative?,btohqsg
I have a negative balance sgd $179.48 now but never use Ichange for more than a month already.,btohqsg
same i dont think its possible too,btohqsg
Hihi I heard that dbs altitude has been nerf  is it still a good card for no expiry miles and lounge access?Am working full time now,btohqsg
depends on what is your monthly spending habit,btohqsg
Local spend mostly  travelling as per normal Singaporeans  go SEA or Asia and look see look see.Hence why no expiry on points is a plus to me,btohqsg
see how much u spend per month and how many cards u intend to hold in the future as well. All cards are good so rlly depends on alot of factors,btohqsg
Is there any savings account that is paying out high interest that is straight forward and without having conditions such as banking in salary  buying insurance  spend a minimum on credit card  giro and unit trust etc? My current OCBC premier+ dividend account has just reduced the interest from 3.7%pa to 3.3%pa and I’m looking for better rates out there,btohqsg
Spend around 400-1.2k in general. Occasional large buys and hence the huge range.Intend to hold onto gen spend cards only  currently only have the 1.6% Citi Cashback+ cardSo  in my scenario  is it worth getting?,btohqsg
Maribank 2.88% till end June 24. GXS Pocket 2.68%.,btohqsg
dbs altitude is not a general spend card fyi. mostly ppl use it for mainly travel related transactions.,btohqsg
i believe Citibank has better general spend cards and since u are alr holding one CIti card  it might be better to consolidate all your spending within 1 bank. But that is my take only,btohqsg
Dbs altitude giving 1.3 mpd ;For most spending and miles don expire right ?,btohqsg
Is there a difference between putting 1% vs go non-competitive?,btohqsg
what does ur transaction history say?,btohqsg
How to invest in this ?,btohqsg
Get DBS RM to call u and get ready 350k,btohqsg
The money market fund need min $350k? Which fund is that ? How much returnsyou getting now ?,btohqsg
Nothing. Everything states unknown. Lucky I never store any money in Ichange account.,btohqsg
DBS Treasures need 350k. U get DBS rm call u and explain easier la,btohqsg
How do you know they’ve dropped the interest? On the website is still 3.7%,btohqsg
Darn!!! This telegram won’t allow me to send u the link. Please go to OCBC site under personal banking notices,btohqsg
I see! I thought the rate cuts will come later in the year,btohqsg
Also OCBC want u to pump 3k instead of existing 2k a month to get that meagre 3.3%. Ridiculous la,btohqsg
U see USD dropping fast and furious after tonight’s wage data. Cut in June coming,btohqsg
Yup pump in more and still get less. That’s why I’m looking for an alternative bank to park my funds. CIMB star saver giving up to 4% but must fulfill 2 requirements spend SGD500 and 3 giros.,btohqsg
are u employee? how abt ocbc 360 and uob one 5% but need 500sgd spend? 100k each,btohqsg
Not into structured funds nor money market.,btohqsg
or 200k just buy 6M Tbill.. it will stay above 3.7%,btohqsg
Yes which is just 3 weeks time.,btohqsg
I think all bank cuting rate  anticipating fed to drop the interest rate,btohqsg
This may be also temporary if all banks start cutting rates,btohqsg
Apple Pay cannot link Instarem now ? 😨,btohqsg

Morning everyoneJust a query.Has Citibank nerfed the Instarem Amaze card completely ?So one will not be able to pair it with the Citi Rewards CC anymore ?,btohqsg

I’m unable to see my supplementary Uob absolute Amex details in my main Uob account app.Is this normal? How to make the details appear?Assume supp card holder doesn’t have internet banking.Thanks.,btohqsg
I'm exploring using blocked cards method to confirm MCC . Read about using Amaze block & DBS block card method to confirm MCC. Reason I'm doing tis is cause I'm going Australia next week and want to be sure of MCC code to ensure it falls into my selected UOB ladies category.  Any 1 tried this blocking method b4 ? To confirm MCC? Which is better n more reliable method?,btohqsg
Do not block cards.Most reliable method is use amaze linked to empty amaze wallet.,btohqsg
May I ask if hsbc paynow for mcst can have 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Any reason to not temp block card? Eg via dbs Internet banking app? Does it affect anything?,btohqsg
There is no direct answer for it. Mind to share ur opinion & knowledge on my query please 🙏,btohqsg
The most reliable and quickest method is the amaze with empty wallet method.Dbs method is way too slow,btohqsg
My knowledge on this is if I want the latest answer  I will use my Citi rewards card and spend $1 with amazing it to get the result. Otherwise  I will just take whatever people post on the chat history.,btohqsg

Anyone participating in the webull share transfer-in promo?,btohqsg
Those who use Ichange  take note not to keep any balance in your account. I charged a transaction on 3 months ago using my balance  then Ichange system tried to double charge for the same transaction hoping that I will forget that I have been charged for it previously.I also had a refund by a merchant 2 month ago but till now not credited to my balance. Ichange not rectifying the missing credit despite I complain many times.Nowadays their rates are no longer attractive either.,btohqsg
does uob one card credit this interest on monthly basis?First S$30 00     3.85%,btohqsg
I think you might be confused.UOB One account credits base interest on the last working day of the calendar month and bonus interest (if eligible) on the second working day of the following calendar month. The website will have a table to show you what bonus interest you're eligible for at which tier and what prerequisites.UOB One credit card credits the cashback (if eligible) the month after the statement quarter. The website will show you what cashback tier you're eligible for.There's no first $30 with interest or cashback at 3.85%  whatever you've stated.,btohqsg
Mainly SG and English speaking here.,btohqsg
No. If you have read the tnc.,btohqsg
This topic is not related to this group. You can email the person directly.,btohqsg
Please understand the product you use first. Is it UOB One account or UOB One credit card.You can read more info from UOB website.,btohqsg
Any monthly insurance premiums? Or buy some wogi vouchers?,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I open UOB one account during this promotion and it states that I need to deposit $5000 to get $68 right? But the normal requirement is to deposit $1000 as initial payment right  so what should I do first? Thank you guys.,btohqsg
Thanks  have you tried wogi voichers?,btohqsg
For syfe u cannot withdraw once u put in. Banks still can withdraw,btohqsg
Does this mean i have met the requirement? The icon seems misleading,btohqsg
Yeah you meet L1 😂Better have Level 2 for higher interest.,btohqsg
Thing is  i met L2 since last week. And u see the text  i have met all requirements but the l2 icon doesnt show a tick,btohqsg
Ya man. I only met Level 1. Also looks the same as yours.Weird  I remember seeing another tick at Level 2 previously.Maybe wait a bit more?,btohqsg
If I use apple pay for Shopback pay  is it considered as online or mobile contactless?,btohqsg
But ur text is different from mine. Yours says u havent met L2. But i have met all activities,btohqsg
Yeah. So you know you already Level 2  nothing to worry about. Probably have to wait a bit for the icon to be updated during business day.,btohqsg
Ok its my first month meeting the requirement so im not sure what to expect plus i met the requirement since monday so i am not expecting it to take so long,btohqsg
There won't be a tick for level 2. Mine is also like that. As long as it says Success you are fine.,btohqsg
initially one of the reasons for vcma to max out BHS before RSTU is because RTSU will limit cpf shielding effectiveness.however  now that we cant shield anymore  does it make sense to RTSU first instead of VCMA so that our MA doesn supercharge our SA as quickly  thereby “delaying” reaching FRS and allowing us maybe 1-2 more years of topping up for tax relief?,btohqsg
You can. Just forego the interest lo,btohqsg
Really? I dont see an option to withdraw,btohqsg
I think after the nerf it's not that good. It's more of a specific travel website card. (Agoda  Expedia  etc)Usually slightly higher prices as well.,btohqsg
Does any know if HSBC platinum visa has a spending cap?,btohqsg
