Anyone saw an order with pick up location at bt timah hill,btohqsg
Guys  ask you all  can bike shop repossession your bike when LTA haven't update new Road  tax when was paid over weekend?,btohqsg
Bike shop as in mechanic? Whats it got to do with them,btohqsg
Bike shop where I purchase from them  there's still installments,btohqsg
Anyone come across such black shop?,btohqsg
Got to read your purchase agreement t&c  they prob have right to repossess if payments overdue,btohqsg
Guys. I keep getting damn far pick up. Anybody face the same issue?,btohqsg
It's not an issue  LLM is like that.,btohqsg
No lah lolololFirst see your locationIf everyday same time same issue maybe u jus camping wrong spotIf u dont think its loc issue then maybe check your phone gps,btohqsg
If u keep getting jobs not just faraway but always from same area  it could be your gps is lagging and stuck in those locations,btohqsg
I see. Thanks for the explanation.,btohqsg
If during peak hr shouldnt be like that  maybe need to check your phone üòÖ,btohqsg
Wtf customer ask send some cooking stuff half size,btohqsg
The help line damn useless. I chat with them  they say please provide evidence I call the merchant to confirm specs and dimensions of payload. If never confirm then must suck it up,btohqsg
That time I kena one. Description say 12 wine glasses. Turns out it‚Äôs 2 boxes of it. I told live chat that if I turn up with bike  the only way I can transport this rubbish is if I tie pallet jack behind the motorbike,btohqsg
The hotline haoseow one. Spend 1 minute telling you they overwhelmed cos it‚Äôs COVID19 and they are essential service. Then regardless you choose English Chinese or Malay  there is nobody to take your call,btohqsg
If you got trolley on your bike  easier to transport. That's their logic. Bike deliver potted flowers  easiest way is to put on top of helmet.,btohqsg
This one he hope car will take,btohqsg
I realise there's another trick customers do to smoke screen - when they help you put the item in your vehicle. The item may not be oversized but when u arrive at drop off and finally hold the item and its obviously overweight....Then u realise why they so helpful at pickup,btohqsg
So make sure u personally handle every item when loading so that u know if its way too heavy üòÖ,btohqsg

Actually liddis ok right? Since they paynow first.,btohqsg
Or is it supposed to be have purchasing service,btohqsg
No this one is transaction between buyer and sellerSo i think in this case buyer is the one who booked order  and request rider to pay seller first upon pick up,btohqsg
If he paynow first then okBut he say paynow only after cfmMeans rider need pay first...?,btohqsg
Thats why a lot of ppl misunderstand the COD serviceIts supposed to be rider help collect cash upon delivery  not help pay first then get paid upon delivery,btohqsg
Yes rider pay first   they indicate note so customers no wrong if we taken this pick   smart move lao jiao,btohqsg
