It not like a model s plaid   nothing to show off,btohqsg
Haven't come yet lah u should wait till model x comes,btohqsg
Maybe the price will be like x7  xc90,btohqsg
Got a model x for sale 6 seater,btohqsg
I can buy two large seven seater ice suvs  still got left over,btohqsg
Ya omv is over 130 k,btohqsg
But how to open when u are in a cramped carpark lot,btohqsg
I feel the experience of owning one will kinda make up for it but isn't bmw ix same price,btohqsg
Can open one sensors will detect close proximity with a vehicle and the doors will open at a more vertical angle,btohqsg
It required just little space to open u can go and google it,btohqsg
Ok… wait till I strike toto… else it won’t be on my list,btohqsg
Model x is much more expensive at 130 k omv compare ix 90 k omv,btohqsg
Thats why I will personally take the ix over model x any day but it's not available in seven seater so I guess for now Tesla model x is the only viable 7 seater,btohqsg
But isn't the EQB releasing in Singapore soon,btohqsg
So if you want to house kids in the third row then u should wait for the EQB should be more affordable than a model x,btohqsg
This is quite funny. Nice share@Cxspeed,btohqsg
Not that practical for normal MSCPs...,btohqsg
i mean for most cars u got to trade some practicality for looks and style like for example the scirocco and golf,btohqsg
Yeah no best of both worlds huh,btohqsg

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/pm-lee-hsien-loong-address-nation-covid-19-situation-mar-24-258116610 more minutes! What do you think he'll announce today?,btohqsg
No more boosters or vaccinations required,btohqsg
plans to open up causeway/2nd link for private vehicles,btohqsg
But the increase from 5 to 10 pax is a good one for big families!,btohqsg
It's not like numbers are less than a hundred and most importantly  announced figures are only at the tip of the iceberg,btohqsg
HDB car parks are considered outdoors I guess. Same as void deck. So when wash car  mask is optional.,btohqsg
The numbers are still high… 10k… if everyone goes without masks  I think it will go beyond 30k,btohqsg
So I choose to wear masks  and gradually see how,btohqsg
I hope this good sense prevails with the masses,btohqsg
When the daily infected rate goes up… ppl will continue to wear,btohqsg
Just hope that it goes down  then gradually  ppl can go without masks voluntarily,btohqsg
No mask until I go in shopping mallOr in a lift,btohqsg
The less contact one has with his/her mask  the better. The notion of being able to remove ones mask repeatedly at whim simply erodes the function of infection control.,btohqsg
Washing car is a strenuous exercise,btohqsg
Still no news if SG cars can drive to JB yet or not hor,btohqsg
When outdoors no need(Open Air) Parks  Fishing  cycling etc... When indoors ex MRT  Bus  or where people are in an enclosed environment like airconditioned foodcourt best to wear,btohqsg
can lose weight when you wash your car,btohqsg
UK announces urgent fuel tax cut to fight cost of living crisis. Sunak also revealed plans to double the government’s household support fund to £1 billion for those affected by higher energy costs.,btohqsg
i wash my mazda 6 twice only. it is too big to wash. surface area too large. tiring,btohqsg
I washed my car weekly  with my neighbor kakis,btohqsg
the only car i washed didiligently in the past is the alfa. the beloved alfa,btohqsg
now i send it to car wash. haha...,btohqsg
I wash once every 2-3 mths,btohqsg
Usually is just normal wash with shampoo.,btohqsg
when i wash  i dont dry it.,btohqsg
Yes  normal wash with shampoo  I just do it two three months,btohqsg
if your car aint that big ok,btohqsg
So most of the time  it’s covered with a special protective coating…. called “dust”,btohqsg
if you have a hard strong clear coat  not necessary to dry it. water runs off it,btohqsg
Does anyone know where else have the auto car wash? You put money in  drive  reverse  drive  reverse  that type?I remember pioneer point at soon Lee street have (or had).,btohqsg
