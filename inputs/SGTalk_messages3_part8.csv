You can accept that other places have different ways of doing things while producing incredible results  like high quality and highly affordable healthcare.,btohqsg
Are you from Singapore or Singaporean?,btohqsg
What is the purpose of this question?,btohqsg
Hello what is the answer. Are you from Singapore or Singaporean?,btohqsg
Just because you ask a question doesn't mean I have to reply. You have no real name and seem to be a fake WP supporter. I should ask you this question,btohqsg
Can see that you are not from Singapore or Singaporean,btohqsg
Just because I don't type like someone on EDMW doesn't mean I'm not Singaporean  and just because you do doesn't mean you are. Having different political views from you doesn't make someone Singaporean or not either.,btohqsg
lol there's no debate. debate involves talking about issues at hand.,btohqsg
this is just one sore bum who can't discuss issues and engages in personal attacks,btohqsg
Singaporean or not make a great difference. Because there is foreign interference. If you are Singaporean  good  but not Singaporeans mean you are here to destroy us.,btohqsg
The Critical Spectator is also not Singaporean. Do you think he is here to destroy us?,btohqsg
He never say bad thing or denoucing about Singapore,btohqsg
Am I saying bad things about Singapore? Maybe I said that healthcare isn't very affordable. But for low income  don't you think even polyclinic isn't very affordable? 13.20 consultation isn't cheap,btohqsg
it's very worrying when even the slightest critcism against the government or policies at hand is skewed as treason,btohqsg
At the end of the day  choose someone who can represent your voices and walks the talk. It depends on who is contesting in your estate as well.Some really good candidates that I personally feel they walk the talk and should be given the votes in the constituency they are running for.Not promoting them but I have seen and heard what they have done for commoners.Jose Raymond - SPPNicole Seah - WPIswaran - PAPTan Cheng Bock - PSPIndranee - PAPIf you are in the constituency when DPM Heng swee keat is contesting up against Nicole Seah's party. There is no dilemma at all about electing a future PM in the making. Honestly speaking  do you even think he has the calibre to be a PM looking at his performance when he debate against the opposition? Someone who had stroke in the midst of a parliament meeting before - is he in the right health condition to be serving the nation and the people?,btohqsg
a vote for opposition gets you a free highly qualified PAP Grassroots advisor also !,btohqsg
Parliament Gridlock!Imagine the COVID-19 Bills couldn’t be passed for months!Those who need to receive help such as:$9000 (Self Employed who lost income)$1200 (for the needy)$100 (Top-up for elderly)$500 (Temporary Rescue Aid)$500 (Skills Future Top-up)$1400 (Skills upgrade Fund)$1000 (Courage Fund)And many more will not be able to receive help!The lower income earners will not be able to receive proper assistance because the politicians are enjoying debating and having fun in blocking one another while many globally are enjoying popcorns.If you are working hard and someone just come along and asked your manager to freeze you just to make you work harder  do you like it? Do you want Singapore to be in such an environment?Is this the country you want Singapore to be? A country where jokers are being elected ? Just because you want freedom? It is not about you and I  it about the whole community!Vote for those who are really helping!Vote for those who are walking the grounds!Vote for those who can see the bigger picture!,btohqsg
Not all oppositions are clowns though. There are really good calibre oppositions that needs to be voted in to really keep PAP in check. PSP is formed for that reason that Tan Cheng Bock feels that he needs to be there to counter some of PAP's decision although that was his former party.A man who came close from behind losing at the Presidential election to Tony. Someone who has his own views in running a country compared to most president who are just puppets to the parliament listening to PAP without having their own opinions.,btohqsg
PAP will undoubtedly form majority in government  this is pretty much certain,btohqsg
so there will be no stonewalling of bills or proposals,btohqsg
but with a stronger oppositions several issues and blind spots can be better discussed,btohqsg
Yes. We are not saying opposition is gonna win majority. But i am expecting PAP to still hold 51% votes or more and opposition parties may win more seats this time round compared to 2011 GE,btohqsg
If you work very hard and did very well  your manager because want you to do better  dont reward you and send people to monitor you to do even better  do you like it.  If your client or business partners dont appreciate your hard work  and grumble at you to make you do better  will you do better?  Karma goes around,btohqsg
DOnt be sway by the loped sided logic,btohqsg
the flaw in your logic and analogy here  is PAP will be rewarded no matter what. it's question of keeping in power in check,btohqsg
In this election the most risky thing is the high possibility of a total wipeout of alternative voices  a parliament with only pap  no other voice  no debates  only all yes men  this will be really bad for our country. The only way to prevent this from happening is to vote for alternative parties.,btohqsg
What a joke. Then ask them how they spend our money... we need opp in to check the way they force their 1 way ideas like gst n cpf n stuff. Not when everyone is standing together during covid. During covid got opp say dnt wear mask or object gov safely measures? Pls think.,btohqsg
Hahaha. The money belongs to taxpayers so is only rightful they use the reserves to help singaporeans.,btohqsg
Their pay comes from taxpayers as well. They should be getting a big paycut to help rebuild our reserves and not raising gst to build reserves.,btohqsg
The payouts this years is not sufficient to even cover the gst 9% in years to come..,btohqsg
Bullshit. Even if all the contesting opposition wins  Pap will still be able to push thru as the number of seat won by opposition will not be enough to block. Stop fearmongering la.,btohqsg
Other countries can have collaboration between political parties and come out fine  but it seems we are so scared of that. WP doesn't vote against the PAP 100% of the time hor.Our unemployment scheme isn't world leading by any means  and there's a still a lot of means testing. Some countries also have unemployment insurance  so it's an adjustment to the policy versus inventing new ones in a rush  which the civil service had to do.https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/12/how-the-uk-furlough-scheme-compares-with-other-countries,btohqsg
If all opposition win doesn’t it mean that pap totally out?,btohqsg
Since opposition contesting in all grc?,btohqsg
Actually the big three contesting in 56 seats. More than enough to form government.I agree that a change in govt is unlikely  but freak events do happen.,btohqsg
PAP will retain their supermajority to change the constitution as they wise even in the best case scenario for the opposition.If the vote share where you live is no longer so overwhelmingly PAP  the backbenchers will be pressured to quit their day job and become full time MPs  and cover for the ministers in their GRC so MPS doesn't take hours to meet an MP.,btohqsg
so many years never see freak events before. don't fear mongering.,btohqsg
Assuming the opposition wins in all seats  must they form a colliation among themselves? The smallest party can align with PAP right?,btohqsg
Then the parties should come out and make their stand clear. Will they form coalition with Pappy or not?,btohqsg
So many years also dont have something as serious as COVID.,btohqsg
I think just vote WP. The rest of the opposition dont bother la,btohqsg
Then at least we will have some quality opposition in parliament.,btohqsg
What's the point of asking a question that can only happen at least 5 years later? We have less than 4 days before cooling off day on Thursday  and there's still a lot of uncovered ground to talk about. Reserved presidency and AHTC ruling are just two things that come to mind.We'll have to see in the future whether PAP is willing to work in a coalition in the first place!,btohqsg
I dunno if any of the oppo will form coalition with pap lor. They spend so long whacking pap then suddenly friends?,btohqsg
If like that then their party might as well go bang wall now lol. No principle,btohqsg
Let Dr Ye explain what is quantum anion energy and how it can help your life naturally healthy!https://www.facebook.com/gekho.sg/videos/305489627241424/?vh=e&d=n,btohqsg
They dun even want to take part in the Chinese debate,btohqsg
Bad  but PAP can still bring it up in the next few days what,btohqsg
would it be better to send a candidate who can't even match OYKs borderline Chinese standard and embarrass themselves on the primetime viewing hour like the other parties? SDP said they were notified of debates only at 2.08pm the day before the debate. When do you think WP and PAP would have been informed?Being able to deliver speeches in mandarin in Parliament and being able to respond on demand in a TV studio is two different things after all.,btohqsg
Dare not try is dare not try lor,btohqsg
