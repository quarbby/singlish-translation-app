what goes up will go down,btohqsg
so one day these PSC scholars,btohqsg
all of them just high flyer iron rice bowl,btohqsg
Scholars should be up for more scrutiny what,btohqsg
they can fuck up smrt until lan lan guess where they are now,btohqsg
scrutiny doesnt mean hope for them to fail what,btohqsg
If not they have all the benefits and none of the associated cost,btohqsg
one day the hammer will come down,btohqsg
and what would Singapore be without it being globalised,btohqsg
I never HOPE for them fail,btohqsg
no  the govt built a self protective system alr,btohqsg
I want them to succeed but I doubt their character,btohqsg
maybe i wasn't specific enuff but not the time to debtae the merits of globalism HAHA,btohqsg
Come down do what? Area cleaning?,btohqsg
Ok u say why u don't like globalist,btohqsg
World isn't fair though ? ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ?? ?,btohqsg
im just here to talk shit,btohqsg
Bruh u in power then u no care about ur ppl  is it,btohqsg
eh eh I need go overseas one leh  globalism bloody work out for me ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
U not scared u Kenna fucked in election meh,btohqsg
Most of Civil Service never enter politics though,btohqsg
If they really need a pay raise they should be able to find it,btohqsg
Eh I tot psc mostly become politician,btohqsg
Mostly? There's only so many Ministers,btohqsg
Even if you include all the Parl secs that's like a few 10 20 people,btohqsg
You have CEO positions and Chairmanships to fill,btohqsg
Oops so Minister background mostly from where,btohqsg
Minister just 1 portion of the elite what,btohqsg
I don't care about the elites. I care about how those in power rule sg,btohqsg
The elites can continue earn money in their own sector without touching politics,btohqsg
I don't care about this also doesn't affect me ma,btohqsg
Ya  and the Perm Secs rule SG as much as the Ministers do,btohqsg
Then perm sec background is from where leh,btohqsg
probably does affect u in the long run tbh,btohqsg
look at how for example bill gates,btohqsg
but has money so can do a lot of shit,btohqsg
PSC  though they always try get from private who complain 'pay low',btohqsg
Kk I get ur point but bgates too extreme an eg,btohqsg
Eh wait I don't understand this,btohqsg
So I forgot to go for discovery dayðŸ˜± and I didn't receive any admission offer,btohqsg
U mean people in private who complain pay low go psc earn more cash?,btohqsg
My fren went for the talk and told me there's a link,btohqsg
Which leads u to the offer,btohqsg
No  usually if public sec want to headhunt obviously they go for big shot right. These big shot can earn like biggggggggg $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ so they complain public sector pay 2low.And if they are joining the pub sector higherup  we are talking possibly 20k+/mois 'low' to them,btohqsg
There is a lot of higherups who are PSC,btohqsg
I mean honestly how to change,btohqsg
The whole point is their private job pay high so they no incentive to be corrupt,btohqsg
Tell the private sector accept low pay,btohqsg
But they have 'lifestyle' to maintain,btohqsg
I mean if u up there,btohqsg
