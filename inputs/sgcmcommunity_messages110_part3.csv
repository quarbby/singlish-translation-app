only C180  A class  GLB  EVs there,btohqsg
Thanks arnav for the tips n price list very helpful to all. I'll look at the a class tml n new a3 looks good price of 161k is not bad,btohqsg
Yes they're not displaying too much  they did more roadshows for their  promos towards the end of last year,btohqsg
160k after COE for cat A is still a 80k car... for a 1.0 üòí,btohqsg
Yupp Audis have a pretty good deal on as of now for all segments  brings price closer to that during the lower COE prices,btohqsg
The times we live in sir,btohqsg
Cannot compare too much to back then,btohqsg
Just can look at the best deal you can get now if you die die want to buy a car right now,btohqsg
unless COE drop to 50K or lower. haha,btohqsg
these are not times to be buying new  cars too,btohqsg
Arguably the cheapest in that segment as well don't forget that,btohqsg
When looking at the a class and 2 series,btohqsg
Agree but some people don't mind and wish to,btohqsg
Let them pump some money into businesses,btohqsg
In 2020 was best time  I rem the old a3 was only 100k leong and A4 130k lol,btohqsg
quite ironically when you think audi being the premium VAG brand,btohqsg
All cars were getting a mild hybrid facelift,btohqsg
A4 was 130k  could get at 120 depending on your nego and car you trade in,btohqsg
Jus curious for merc n bm in 2020 wad was the cheapest price for a class n 2 Series Nd 218,btohqsg
If you're buying for looks and badge sure,btohqsg
Was 35k I rem cos my coe was in Oct 2020 haha,btohqsg
I personally prefer the previous gen coupe more,btohqsg
1 series looks great as well,btohqsg
Are you in an A4 now?,btohqsg
cannot too rash. it's not like shopping for bags üòÇ,btohqsg
so much cheaper than 3 series or C class. ‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg
Because the g20 3 series had just been launched,btohqsg
While Audi and Merc were clearing stocks for the c class and A4,btohqsg
dunno when can upgrade my car.. sianz,btohqsg
As the b9.5 mild hybrid was incoming with the slightly updated interior for Audi,btohqsg
Nah I got the octavia for 90k üòä good car but wanna change heh,btohqsg
And for the c class it was a whole new gen coming,btohqsg
I wouldn't recommend going from your Octavia to an A3/216/CLA,btohqsg
Power is lower or the same,btohqsg
Your Octavia is the 1.4 I suppose,btohqsg
And realistically you're not getting a much better interior in any of these also,btohqsg
All 3 have significant hard plastics,btohqsg
Octavia at 90k just stick with it. No point saddling yourself with a bigger financial burden on a whim,btohqsg
And the Merc side has had quality control issues with creaking plastics,btohqsg
oh ya..anyone managed to get subaru price list?,btohqsg
Hmm mine was 1.0 version haha  den with a budget of 170 to 180k wad good conti could u rec bro?,btohqsg
170 to 180k if you go used maybe can get a better upgrade leh,btohqsg
Unless you stretch for the A4 2.0,btohqsg
In that case you'd actually be upgrading,btohqsg
True but its about time I move start to move to the big 3 conti brands  only live one life jus try loh. I still make 10k profit so jus pump in next car,btohqsg
The b9.5 is pretty decent however it is down on power at 148hp compared to the b9 generation that was 190hp stock,btohqsg
realistically only Audi. c class and 3 are too much of a stretch,btohqsg
You sell high and buy high remember,btohqsg
some of The audi prices at the roadshow dun include servicing .. warranty changed from 5 years to 3 years.. hais,btohqsg
That is apparently up for negotiation,btohqsg
