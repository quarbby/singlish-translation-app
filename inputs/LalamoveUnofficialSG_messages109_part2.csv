Remember cannot give in all the time. If its really heavy y risk the injury. If complain to llm n llm want suspend just show them the proof.,btohqsg
If get injured  later cannot work for awhile  income loss. That 1 no1 will sympathise with us,btohqsg
They will only say who ask u want to carry on doing the job,btohqsg
If very heavy means prob more than 20kg  exceed car job limit liao,btohqsg
It's not just that 1 item hor,btohqsg
It should b all items add up,btohqsg
Cos we can normally carry the 5 10kg rice when we buy groceries,btohqsg
So u can agar know the weight,btohqsg
Even if u don't have weighing scale,btohqsg

Got some jobs write this. But normally the job itself will say need sign off etc when u drop at each stop. There will b an option prompt u. Just follow it can liao. If don't have then bor bian,btohqsg
It's a standard template they use to write in the job comment,btohqsg
those job which requires trolley or us to carry heavy loads that comes with low fare   don't accept. we have to be united on this. let the price rise,btohqsg
I assume so. Cannot b 1 item max 20kg. Later they have 5 items all max 20kg that means 100kg load we have to transport ahðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Yes must work smart. Always use call log and photos as evidences to avoid penalty such as cash deduction and suspension  etc.,btohqsg
I wonder where u park at ion. the whole stretch of road is so congested ...,btohqsg
If can take fast then grace period,btohqsg
If cannot then pay. But only as long as the job has good enough price or +$ cover the cp,btohqsg
but cp also need to queue to drive in what.  after that have to find lot. time wasted,btohqsg
Depends on what time. I don't go in during peak time where have to q etc,btohqsg
whenever I drive pass that area the road is always congested leh. like no timing de. it's always jam hahaha,btohqsg
It's not like paragon n taka there,btohqsg
Ion n wisma still have times where not so jam,btohqsg
Have to know how it is if want to do town jobs,btohqsg
I also don't do jobs where u see from 1 resto send to another of their own resto,btohqsg
It's prob deliver stock. Sometimes it may be small thing. But sometimes can be alot of stuff,btohqsg
I did 1 job that day from pandan loop to resto in town,btohqsg
Take job liao then say send stock of fries n frozen meat. Total 5 boxes,btohqsg
How do you guys stack orders?,btohqsg
I told the sender I no trolley etc   u never state need,btohqsg
Told her I cannot load n unload myself. She say she arrange with the pickup n drop off. Pickup pt they help me load. Drop off pt they waiting with trolley when I reachðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Nvr reject cos sender say will arrange pple help me load n unload,btohqsg
It was during mothers day wkend. I don't want injure myself. Lugi the wkend like thatðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Little farm nvr write need trolley 1. So I very scared to pickup their stuff. Especially if its outlet to outlet. If its to their customer still ok,btohqsg
Basically we have to work smart n know when to stand up for our own rights n interests,btohqsg
this one super not worth. multiple trips always not worth unless locations are all nearby each other,btohqsg
3 jobs at one time should be comfortable and will not be late. For me I try to take 1 or 2 scheduled jobs in advance example orchard to Pasir Ris. Take jobs around the same area and with no difficulty in parking. I will take either 2 or 1 11am or 2 or 1 at 11.15am or 11.30am. In this way  you will not be late. When u take the 3rd or 4th job  you must take it more than 30 min before the next job. The app will know that you have advance jobs and will not allow u to take job if less than 30 mins. Hope I am clear with my explanation.,btohqsg
Wah this one really free exercise ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
Used to stack 3 even 4 b4. During covid lockdown. When traffic was smooth. Now at most I stack 2  cos wkend traffic especially in town now very bad. Don't want stress,btohqsg
Wah I'm sorry to hear that,btohqsg
Now getting abit harder to estimate time needed. Cos traffic bad n with more dine in  restos starting to be late with orders. All these r unknown factors which may screw up the stack n cause late,btohqsg
I don't want the stress so I don't stack so manyðŸ˜‚also I norm don't take advanced jobs  cos price not that high. I still very choosyðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I only take scheduled jobs above $22. I spent a lot of time watching the app. If u donâ€™t take scheduled jobs  very difficult to earn. The last weekends  I worked only Friday to Sunday and cash out $1169.,btohqsg
Everyone started doing stupid and silly jobs,btohqsg
Not yet sofa. If have should be today for one lateness but I am able to cover myself,btohqsg
That's very very very good amt. But I greedy lah  so I only take jobs after commission 20 aboveðŸ˜‚normally will need either +$ or high demand charge. So I don't take scheduled jobs ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
U should not have waited. I wouldnâ€™t wait,btohqsg
That's too long a time to wait. I don't mind wait if its my last job homeward bound for the day. But if during holiday or special occasion day with alot of high price jobs I won't waste time waitinf,btohqsg
Must know time is of utmost importance during such days,btohqsg
