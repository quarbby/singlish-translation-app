But when holidays over the traffic will be bad so take that into consideration when doing stack,btohqsg
So how was ur llm ytd? Do good? ðŸ’ª,btohqsg
Now festive season not bad 1,btohqsg
I wonders whatâ€™s the qualifications of Lalamove CS. Knn live chat to tell them the customer unreachable even send them screenshot of WhatsApp and call log. They still keep telling me to tell customer to cancel. Wtf?,btohqsg
Rabak. Still dare collect platform fee from people,btohqsg
Why lala now keep deduct extra $0.50 from fare ?,btohqsg
B4 take job see fare $20  accept job alr become $19.50,btohqsg
Starting16 December 2024  a platform fee of$0.50will be applied to every order and automatically charged to users on our platform.This fee helps us continuously enhance our service quality while improving safety and protection measures for our driver partners. Do take note that the driver's earnings remain unchanged.Please clickherefor more information.,btohqsg
Basically they earn not enough want take more lor,btohqsg
Employ useless CS still wan more money,btohqsg

Actually is can la just like working LorBut like not worth cos driving is at tired job also la,btohqsg
Just wait for peak timing and take stack order,btohqsg
LLM project car job offer $6.50 lol not so cluster. Joking sis,btohqsg
Depends on how much u want make lor,btohqsg
Yah tdy really cui off peakðŸ˜‚but earlier have a number of decent jobs,btohqsg
Tdy I just do 1 llm n later 1 private get total $99 then pkðŸ˜‚see if can get any llm job bring me to private job pickup areaðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Either u do llm with other platforms or u have private gigs,btohqsg
Just llm alone hard to survive,btohqsg
"Ya but mostly long distance  office area or ""big"" surprise job hahaha.",btohqsg
The least LLM can do is to ask the customer specify the order items. Nb I heard Oddle purposely remove also because they can't get driver for big order ðŸ¥±,btohqsg
i gave up talking to LLM customer service... same IQ level as Grab... all IQ level 10 only,btohqsg
I like ofc areaðŸ˜‚many of them my fansðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
that's why i give priority to my regulars who pay me direct,btohqsg
when they saw me accept their job on LLM  they whatsapp me tell me they will cancel the job on LLM and pay me direct ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
this kind of regulars hard to find,btohqsg
Pooling job  4 cartonsâ€¦.hahâ€¦all the best,btohqsg
Want cut costs end up cost more,btohqsg
Better cancelWait delay  your car stinks of meat water when thawWorst  they complain lalamove and send them goods cost invoice  llm straight deduct you $300++ from wallet and suspendVery common nowNot your faultBut u pay,btohqsg
Cheapo wan to do Biz but save on transport,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s right. Plus these 4 cartons are MPV standard based on the total weight and volume.,btohqsg
Whenever who got this pooling order please tell customer that their items is not going to send immediately but within 24 hours/end of the day  if customer don't want to top up the cost just ask them cancel. It is pointless to argue with them. The stupid ideal to have this pooling pricing should blame LLM let them settle with customers.,btohqsg
Even 2.4m van also can have pooling  what is meaning for van keeping items for 24 hours/end of the day?,btohqsg
Full load use pooling but send immediately all this are nonsense by LLM  leave this type of orders be there forever,btohqsg
Confirm got some hungry ghost will take one lah,btohqsg
It is ok for someone take the order may be his destination can take it along like same direction/area,btohqsg
That's exactly what I notice this whole week... At least commission is listed. This auto deduction is like kena cheated,btohqsg
But I will not do that,btohqsg
Let the hungry one do lo,btohqsg
Covid time was good. Till 2022 then spoil market liao,btohqsg
I did lesser job from LLM this year because of the pricing,btohqsg
You can try grab  price not bad,btohqsg
Pooling need to send by how many hrs. I drag 2hrs,btohqsg
24 hours/end of the day (up to you),btohqsg
Grab express how long need to complete,btohqsg
Normally I stack but try to reach before 1hr,btohqsg
