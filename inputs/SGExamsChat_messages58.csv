ah NOW I KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT,btohqsg
but can i join the grp and add salt tho,btohqsg
Nope I just got added today LOL,btohqsg
But I am having fun inside,btohqsg
We ban people only when we see their names add people in,btohqsg
i remember seeing his message right before me,btohqsg
oH were u the one who copypasta milo’s text,btohqsg
I just keep using my boomer persona inside,btohqsg
you're not excused  so shut up and get your shit together before u come back and chat in this group,btohqsg
Alright you guys need to chill out,btohqsg
As his teacher  please speak to him and correct him,btohqsg
I can add ur contact ah then I add u,btohqsg
I know it’s wrong that they are adding people from this group,btohqsg
But there’s no need to go around harassing people,btohqsg
Especially people whom you don’t know they are involved,btohqsg
my tutor legit lagging like crazy,btohqsg
so i watching youtube on the side,btohqsg
Tbh i dont care what he do. As long as he teach his students well  he is a good tutor,btohqsg
wait so hes a legit tracher ,btohqsg
More reasons to take down the private tuition industry,btohqsg
Not sure how true is the moe part,btohqsg
sometimes i forget john smith was a teacher,btohqsg
For the long period of 1 month,btohqsg
Some of you here are behaving like kids,btohqsg
he having lockdown faster than sg,btohqsg
i think i know whats going on,btohqsg
You are free to express your opinions in this group,btohqsg
usually marketing companies create these huge groups for various topics,btohqsg
Do u even have evidence he created all those fake accounts ?,btohqsg
Aren't ur former student behaving the same way?,btohqsg
Your friend is too  behaving like a kid,btohqsg
then sell it for money or make people pay to put ups ads there,btohqsg
some earn up to 5 figure a month,btohqsg
ya 99% of them are all run privately with intention to monetise,btohqsg
ok this is even funnier than this shit already was,btohqsg
That’s not the issue in contention here; recognise that we are only unhappy about him taking our members without any permission— something that many many many can attest to. The fake accounts thing is just icing on the cake.,btohqsg
the admins earn money from the ads they post,btohqsg
I’m sure it’d be worth a lot,btohqsg
but the people behind them isnt,btohqsg
it was a good place bruh,btohqsg
Well there’s literally nothing we can do,btohqsg
i mean i accidentally left but didnt go back,btohqsg
esp since i single nobody to go out paktor with,btohqsg
Yeah it is I am still in,btohqsg
You can even add people from this group even when you are not added to the group,btohqsg
if you name the admins the right price you get to buy the group/channel,btohqsg
i have a friend working in a job scouting/recruitment company,btohqsg
they just bought a telegram group/channel recently,btohqsg
Wait I am on the channel one instead,btohqsg
is it not against some trade or advert law tbh,btohqsg
then what abt the buying dateideas or wtv idk,btohqsg
Privacy and security —> groups and channels —> only my contacts,btohqsg
And I occasionally see stuff on it,btohqsg
so ya even those looking for jobs group,btohqsg
I think in the US the FTC will go hard on their ass,btohqsg
people behind it earn money for just having the group,btohqsg
We are all lonely people here,btohqsg
they won't care about some random ass telegram group,btohqsg
someone shld buy them then just shut it down,btohqsg
unique activities we can do together😉😉,btohqsg
they have better uses of time like sucking up to party lines,btohqsg
The legality part most related would be PDPA  personal data protection.,btohqsg
actually yea I wonder if it does violate PDPA,btohqsg
But you gotta be careful ah.,btohqsg
isnt pdpa just about private data,btohqsg
Cus if found in violation  can be fined quite a lot.,btohqsg
Wait@IcedMilois combot only active in SGexams A's,btohqsg
got anything to do with that type of photo meh,btohqsg
I can’t find combot in the O level groups and chat group,btohqsg
Well at least on their website,btohqsg
"If you consider telegram username and photo as personal data  then this group is ""in violation"".",btohqsg
I disabled combot from showing our groups on the website,btohqsg
But I'm pretty sure that won't hold up.,btohqsg
don't need more spam than we already have,btohqsg

Then Soon Kueh is immediately out,btohqsg
or the hot young buff male teacher,btohqsg
Everyday we learn smth new abt John,btohqsg
or the fat uncles who la kopi everyday,btohqsg
ignore the profile pic it's just my owner I'm still a woof,btohqsg
This person seems to the guy who add everyone to the other group,btohqsg
@flipthebuckethe said spf all very comfortable ah,btohqsg
So she’s saying they’d rather die than live in poor conditions,btohqsg
How would they not want to recover...,btohqsg
anyone here got worksheets/tutorial/exam ques from h2 computing ?,btohqsg
Well theres sufficient counter evidence to take him down,btohqsg
On top of how he doxxed someone in another group,btohqsg
bruh i saw his interim rules and he wanted to “POFMA” people who are against him,btohqsg
Lmao and yet he POFMA ppl also,btohqsg
sorry i mean take legal action for defamation,btohqsg
I talked abt how he roasted the old man who bought a ton of eggs using his metal trolley,btohqsg
Then turns out the person wasnt a hoarder,btohqsg
Quite old alr  so idk if its deleted or not,btohqsg
can we make this a sticker,btohqsg
Lmao the sgtuitions got more beef eh,btohqsg
Gimme a sec if i still have the picsThen u all can see whos wrong,btohqsg
In the end he got counter roasted in the group,btohqsg
How many people were in it,btohqsg
I remember he was roasting an NUS law grad,btohqsg
He got kicked out in the end,btohqsg
Impersonating MOE/Misleading suggestion of MOE endorsement with the use of their crest?,btohqsg
Wow  some of those names who joined the group look familiar,btohqsg
wa the guy legit law grad?,btohqsg
is he ownself say one or like legit,btohqsg
academic achievement says nothing abt mental health,btohqsg
Yea no shit it’s just topic,btohqsg
Organic is one whole theme m8,btohqsg
It’s like asking them to remove calculus in a math lmao,btohqsg
@cauchycriteriontime to just study more planes stuff,btohqsg
the one that everyone got added into,btohqsg
Guys can you apply to a NUS hall a year in advance?,btohqsg
Or must be same year entry then can apply uh,btohqsg
If u want i can give u exam qns on python in uni,btohqsg
Can ah nothing wrong in learning via trial and error,btohqsg
As long is its not something cancerous,btohqsg
mental illness is independent from intelligence btw!,btohqsg
">spam invites random people>""defamation!! we're being defamed!!""",btohqsg
I like how he’s running a Telegram group,btohqsg
Like as if he’s GOVERNING A MUDDAFUKIN COUNTRY,btohqsg
He does remind me of China,btohqsg
guys dont bully him liao later he take legal action bc defamation 🥺,btohqsg
Oh  China is not that daft.That’s an insult to China  and they already set the bar very low.,btohqsg
oh yeah  we'll definitely get in trouble 🤣🤣,btohqsg
because he is a lawyer  the law bends to his likings i guess,btohqsg
He got pass the bar anot,btohqsg
tbh to govern and control such a huge country is not easy at all,btohqsg
siao liao wait tonight he send one more message in his telegram groups saying he want start war,btohqsg
Must’ve failed the bar to be so pathetic right?,btohqsg
time to hide in mua bunker,btohqsg
His attempt to create supergroups reminds me of that time period when everybody are YouTuber wannabes sia.,btohqsg
is there anyone here who's in NUS pharmacy?,btohqsg
Singapore Incidents: .... for NOT WEARING MASK,btohqsg
Lol they added sgexams to their blacklist,btohqsg
I think the best policy not to do anything right now,btohqsg
i just think its cringe and funny,btohqsg
Anyways the more you talk about them here  the more free coverage they will get,btohqsg
people dont respond to weak leadership,btohqsg
I’m gonna delete that message cause it’s low key advertisement,btohqsg
lol i thought sgexams renamed or sth when i saw the group,btohqsg
All the cool fishes are doing it,btohqsg
We can’t really do much but remind everyone to set their privacy settings so that they can’t be added to random groups,btohqsg
How about we book those grp names ahead of him,btohqsg
He already got those group names,btohqsg
Also  we don’t have to do that,btohqsg
that's stooping to their level lmao,btohqsg
We will do what we have always done,btohqsg
So we won’t do anything unethical,btohqsg
But he clearly started it to kind of challenge sgexams,btohqsg
And to monetise it in the long run,btohqsg
If his group turns out to be more useful then all the better for students,btohqsg
Otherwise  it will just die by itself,btohqsg
Let's be real  the profits he will obtain will be small compared to the amount of work he has to invest,btohqsg
Theres some NUS/NTU undergrad doing somethin like this  and he earms quite a fair bit  appeared recently online,btohqsg
U need to reach a specific number of users to achieve that though,btohqsg
Is just like instagramInfluencers get paid to advertise and the renumeration is dependent on number of followers,btohqsg
But I doubt this is what he’s going for,btohqsg
Cause this niche is already taken,btohqsg
And they are funded  not profiting off their members,btohqsg
He can do advertisments in other domains,btohqsg
Ye but they admitted in an article they also profit from food ads posted from ppl who want them to advertise in the channel,btohqsg
Well I'd suppose he count charge like 30 dollars for a message about some random tuition centre,btohqsg
But the very idea of it sounds ridiculous,btohqsg
I wont be surprised if he does it,btohqsg
Ah yes monetisation of education  ranks alongside child abuse in terms of level of exploitation,btohqsg
That’s great! If any company decides advertising there is good use of marketing Budget  let them die there. 🙃,btohqsg
Tuition Centres that do adverts are unethical themselves anyway. Let the unethicals cannibalise each other. See who win.,btohqsg
I hate the tuition business =(,btohqsg
You are in very good company,btohqsg
poor thing sia kenna misunderstood :”(,btohqsg
actually why ah what happen to him,btohqsg
why he buy so many eggs,btohqsg
I think he just delivery man,btohqsg
wah shit then he drop the eggs,btohqsg
u nvr watch wat happen at KFC ystd,btohqsg
But my supervisors recommend me to open one,btohqsg
Lmao theres more beef abt the guy above in another grp,btohqsg
Nor was i added to any grp,btohqsg
Aite i just read first three screenshots,btohqsg
And suddenly burpees seem more interesting,btohqsg
Anyways this is a dox technically,btohqsg
u finish ur hbl alr isitt,btohqsg
U need to see the full convo,btohqsg
I didnt take what happened thereafterIts still ongoing,btohqsg
You mind deleting those pictures though?,btohqsg
His real name is john smith,btohqsg
but my dch literally no live lessons at all,btohqsg
they say is to give chance to those who only have one com must give to the siblings use,btohqsg
as in we do have live lessons but its discouraged,btohqsg
ur sch ppl so poor meh,btohqsg
I tot can borrow laptop frm sch,btohqsg
then essentially like theres almost no live lessons? this week i only got three,btohqsg
and i feel rhat without live lessons its even harder to catch up with lessons u feel me?,btohqsg
but think abt the other students,btohqsg
who never retain so they never learn these topics before,btohqsg
elasticities they study until super blur themselves,btohqsg
Wow people actually read the pinned message,btohqsg
Ofc i will read u write one leh,btohqsg
let those two jokers sort themselves out,btohqsg
I'm starting to think those 2 Jokers may be the same person,btohqsg
The two people flaming the other guy,btohqsg
what the... is he as childish as he acts online?,btohqsg
basically 1 of them is flaming the owner of the grp that siphoned ppl here,btohqsg
and the other person is flaming him back,btohqsg
There’s 2 accounts flaming him back,btohqsg
So he's bringing a second account to fight since he can't win by himself,btohqsg
But okay I should be studying,btohqsg
that's not how u tell lmao,btohqsg
It has a real number attached,btohqsg
And not a US fake number,btohqsg
anyone got balls to whatsapp her,btohqsg
i chatted with that person before 3 weeks ago,btohqsg
Yeh I saw  I'm calling it a fake account because the person behaves weirdly,btohqsg
was asking about science grad prospects  and it was quite detailed,btohqsg
i rather u report the fake doctor in the other grp,btohqsg
Idk many school teachers who would associate themselves with a group like this,btohqsg
Urgh I much preferred it when this chatroom talked about NS,btohqsg
Now we are just gossipping about people we don’t know,btohqsg
hahahaha go expose her for us,btohqsg
don't need drag other ppl inside,btohqsg
what u want me to do,btohqsg
later milo beat my ass up,btohqsg
To them  the group seems perfectly legit,btohqsg
maybe sgexams seems more childish/immature to them,btohqsg
and hence this grp seemed more suitable/fitting,btohqsg
u have ppl occassionally sending ''is this guy cute'' polls,btohqsg
Yeah  someone should introduce SGExams to them,btohqsg
You wanna do it do it yourself haha,btohqsg
plus i dont see how his grps is more qualified/useful if there are legit full time tutors/MOE tutors in the a lvl sgexams group,btohqsg
Unless you send a catfish inside...,btohqsg
Better: just ignore them cause it’s not worth your time,btohqsg
circuit breaker making us less able to ignore this,btohqsg
technically u all have the informal backing of MOE,btohqsg
they don't  and yet they use MOE's logo,btohqsg
That’s why we will be professional,btohqsg
But  if they add us in,btohqsg
We can bomb the group before leaving,btohqsg
*if they continue adding us in,btohqsg
how do u leave a group from tg web,btohqsg
Says the one with the same name as an admin 🤡,btohqsg
The second one is a faker,btohqsg
The second one is u tho 😂,btohqsg
so we singing home together or nah,btohqsg
i am the real john smith,btohqsg
You are the real John Smith,btohqsg
Of John impersonation or covid 🤡,btohqsg
what do u admire most abt him ??,btohqsg
There’s nothing about him that isn’t admirable,btohqsg
do u have a john shrine,btohqsg
Oh I didn’t know that the dorms can be so cute and colorful like that,btohqsg
I can already hear the yandere simulator noises,btohqsg
Press X to doubt John Smith is a real person,btohqsg
its v characteristic of a impersonator,btohqsg
bcos i know ur extent of ur impersonation,btohqsg
You’re impersonating multiple people all called Megan,btohqsg
i am megan but not megan,btohqsg
and you are a fake john,btohqsg
Another sticker for the sgexams pack,btohqsg
Idk why I kena added into so many groups yesterday,btohqsg
No one would tell me why,btohqsg
sgeducator is like a cousin of sgexams,btohqsg
And also set your privacy settings,btohqsg
So that you can’t be added into random groups,btohqsg
I was gonna say you were gonna lead the charge,btohqsg
Today two guys from Iran texted me,btohqsg
One to hit me up and another to add me to a group,btohqsg
I was very uncomfortable this morning,btohqsg
I can hear that one voice from those anti e-commerce scams ads,btohqsg
anyone got good recipe for mac and cheese,btohqsg
everytime the mac and cheese always taste like,btohqsg
Boil pasta in milk add cheese,btohqsg
it just tastes like m e h,btohqsg
i add salt and pepper also no taste,btohqsg
Like garlic or onion powder  or paprika,btohqsg
