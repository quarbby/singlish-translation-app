Is uni stress and workload arnd the same amt as JC sec sch,btohqsg
Depends on how you allocate your time  but honestly I guess I feel more free in uni than jc/sec,btohqsg
depends on what you want to score.Personally I put it this way90 rp in JC is comparable to fch in Uni,btohqsg
what helped me in uni in my first two years was I had laser focus on the work to be done  yet at the same time carve out proper time for exercise 6 days a week. It was like an extension of NS for me.Then my year 4 I slack already  because by then lazy. Because focus was lost by then and I was just thinking everyday  faster graduate go out work and earn $.,btohqsg
tho ri and hci shit it out like its nth lol,btohqsg
how was your schedule like for your first two years,btohqsg
I put it down to time management  discipline and motivation.I know I lost most of it in my year 4. But fortunately first 2 years had enough points to still get through to fch.And my fyp prof was so nice,btohqsg
each semester I took 6 modules  so it's like 24 MCs (those in NUS will know)Because I chose German as my language programme  for 2 of the days  the lessons end at 8pm.,btohqsg
Is JC life more fun than neighbourhood school,btohqsg
short answer in 2 letters: no,btohqsg
depends on wat u mean by fun lol,btohqsg
Fun is relative. But general consensus will be no.,btohqsg
I remembered when i took some random ass geog unrestricted elective in my first uni sem and they covered the entire h2 geog in 1 sem (or so thats what people told me),btohqsg
needless to say i S/Ued it,btohqsg
when u realise ur subject chers are wayyy behind on the syllabus in neighbourhood sch n u need study ahead pein,btohqsg
how did you slot in gym time,btohqsg
I slotted in 2 days of gym  2 days of swimming while in sch.It's those in between lesson slots.Sometimes I have break from 12pm to 3pm. Then I go swim or gym  from 12+ to 1+  then shower  go eat at YIH.Then continue lesson,btohqsg
h2 physics + h3 physics + more covered in two sems in my uni y1,btohqsg
Does anyone have any tips for me learning implicit differentiation,btohqsg
But I scared I'm starting to,btohqsg
my b graduates from there but not interested in working in it,btohqsg

maybe cus i excercise so infrequently i always manage to injure myself somehow lol,btohqsg
Also it's kinda dumb of me to ask but is stuffd salmon raw or what,btohqsg
at that time  no. Still ok after NS.Plus the gym was still basic. I only lifted way heavier after Year 3.,btohqsg
I can't taste if it's like sashimi or smth,btohqsg

The S Pen can answer so many more questions easier,btohqsg
Oh is that Samsung Vs asus,btohqsg
All I see is an S and an A,btohqsg
A is their mid range stuff i think,btohqsg
it's like $1928 vs $600 😭,btohqsg
idk for stuff like this if i’m using it every day for lots of things,btohqsg
Buy then cry then move on and treasure it,btohqsg
what’s the difference in quality tho actually,btohqsg
can A not be used with S pen?,btohqsg
i will probably use for 3 years. Currently using A52,btohqsg
i just pretend i didn’t see lmao,btohqsg
nah he’s alr over way before you,btohqsg
if it can last 7 years,btohqsg
Ig that's what you'd ever amount to,btohqsg

preach  if my note 20 ultra's camera OIS isnt shitting itself i would love to continue using this phone,btohqsg
"as in  specs only sort of ""guarantee"" it to be 2 years  though it should last for way longer",btohqsg
it's been about 4 years thereabout,btohqsg
the 2nd best set of DRAM is for PCs  which are still lousy type.The best ones are reserved for military  and automobiles.,btohqsg
I don't even know whr I gonna end up if I actly major in phy one day lmao,btohqsg
apparently its a very known note 20 ultra problem,btohqsg
didnt even occur until i did some software update,btohqsg
idt you have the right to say that after your blunder ytd ok,btohqsg
you think bringing it up changes anything I've said,btohqsg
Or you'd hope I take backBecause as of now it's as good as gone and that as if it never happened in the first place,btohqsg
i have a s22u and i never use s pen,btohqsg

screen size not that big to rest my hand to write,btohqsg
