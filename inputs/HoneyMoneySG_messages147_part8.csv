Hi For CIMB Fastsaver account  can I paynow my own account to fulfill the Salary credit criteria?,btohqsg
The T&C allows for regular giro  so you can transfer money from your other bank account and it should still qualify for the bonus interest,btohqsg

I think EGA 1% cashback only applies to GIRO instruction to companies (like paying credit card bill etc),btohqsg

Did anyone manage to save nov-dec tnc?,btohqsg
It works now! Thanks for checking with me.,btohqsg
This is a new promotion saying that it is extended is it ?,btohqsg
This is to extend the Nov Dec by one more month on reduced %. Otherwise it will end in Dec if u choose not to extend,btohqsg
Question is if can still get 1% extra on top,btohqsg
From what I read no change to the existing rules for the 1% extra,btohqsg
Means should be the same -so about 3.8%,btohqsg
Yes. 2.8% is based on Oct reference month. 1% is based on Dec reference month.,btohqsg
which loses to UOB One 4% liao,btohqsg

I should have made it clearer. I dca my srs. Not investing my OA at the moment.No right or wrong to DCA or lump sum. I just want to automate my investment and not worrying about monitoring the market.,btohqsg
I’m not sure for infinity card but rewards card qualify for the $500 spend for the 360 account using utilities. Of cos no points rewarded.,btohqsg
I personally also DCA my CPF-OA 🤭,btohqsg
