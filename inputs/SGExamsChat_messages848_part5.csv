But PAP's representative is always Ong Ye Kung,btohqsg
seeing all the recent government politics in sg makes me wanna laugh and cry  almost like a madman,btohqsg
usually private entities gives the largest yield for properties under the en bloc scheme,btohqsg
im just stating smth casually tho  dun hv to go into all the details,btohqsg
its a agree or disagree thing (yes/no)  ntg in between,btohqsg
the prob is enbloc is not always a govt decision,btohqsg
??? why are you bringing in so many extra details to consolidate your talk,btohqsg
At the end of the day Singapore is ruled by demand and supply constraints. Can't be everything also blame government,btohqsg
when you mention future land development..not nessecary..a buyer can buy that plot of land and do nothing lol,btohqsg
HDB prices weren't always ruled by demand by supply. They changed the policy years ago to be so,btohqsg
it was based on cost to build eons ago,btohqsg
And I don't think land costs were included that time,btohqsg
do u think that will happen  with the current government in sg?,btohqsg
But if it was based on cost to build  everyone would be rushing to get a house right now,btohqsg
when HDB said it operates at a loss  it's because of the land cost,btohqsg
then that's where their planning failed,btohqsg
Like now  we have some youngsters who are living rent-free at home,btohqsg
supply is also controlled by HDB,btohqsg
But based on masterplan there's a limit to proportion of residential areas too,btohqsg
govt say enough land to house everyone,btohqsg
it's not a lie. They just build higher and smaller,btohqsg
there's no more executive or mansionette BTOs liao,btohqsg
Means future houses will get smaller?,btohqsg
everyone supposed to stay in smaller HDBs  but still encouraged to have more kidssqueeze pls ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Not everyone want to stay in a small apartment lol.,btohqsg
"""you only need a small space to ....""",btohqsg
"reminds me of the phrase ""you will have nothing  but you will be happy"" lol",btohqsg
there are empty hdb flats waiting to be enbloc dotted all over sg..the govt vacated those flats but they are still standing awaiting demolition..some of these flats have stayed vacant with no plans for them,btohqsg
Actly wat will happen when it ends,btohqsg
Idt gahmen will just throw u to the streets or smth,btohqsg
but we die before it happens usually,btohqsg
They take back your house  you get nothing,btohqsg
yea  when eunosville was vacated it still had 71 years..private buyer negotiated with the govt..and eunosville was cleared,btohqsg
I mean like pass down to ur kids or smth ofc,btohqsg
essentially you're paying rental to the govt,btohqsg
In sg no land is yours lol,btohqsg
Fair unless u too much money,btohqsg
flats standing for 50+ years are already a civil danger for residents,btohqsg
i suppose there're houses older than 200 years that have yet to collapse,btohqsg
they can buy their own new 99 yr lease flats,btohqsg
I'll leave mine for them to sell for their inheritance,btohqsg
Wat if they spend needlessly tho just curious,btohqsg
if I'm dead  it doesn't matter,btohqsg
I can only teach them how to manage.,btohqsg
i mean eitherway the govt will refurbished and renovate the older hdbs...if they were to be demolished even a decade on,btohqsg
just know the people that earn a lot now  many of them didn't do very well at O lvl,btohqsg
I only got 1 choice i rly want then its a steep fall off from thr lol,btohqsg
the govt will still tear down these 31 block of flats after spending money to renovate them for temporary use,btohqsg
Still recall my days collecting results for national papers,btohqsg
hi guys  do you know any video editing software that donâ€™t require to pay fr watermarks. i hv always use capcut but my asst require one w/o it,btohqsg
