already got 1 whole box of projects to do,btohqsg
some to keep and some to sell lol,btohqsg
I have a few Lambo diecast models,btohqsg
When I was younger all I wanted was to be a FnF fanboy with a GTR R34,btohqsg
Now my dream car is either Toyota Crown,btohqsg
tester rims for now tho anyone got suggestions for rims do lmk,btohqsg
Nothing beats having supercar horsepower while carrying a bed from IKEA in the back,btohqsg
1 SVJ  1 LP700-4  2 Huracán STO  1 Veneno  1 Reventon  1 mercilago and a Countach 25th Anniversary,btohqsg
may i intro you to a Scania 770s,btohqsg
770hp shld be fast enough 😂,btohqsg
My biggest regret was not getting the Skoda Octavia VRS Kombi back in 2010 instead of the VW Jetta,btohqsg
upgrade everything and interior is good stuff,btohqsg
It was only like...10k more at 110k iirc,btohqsg
Huracán STO is my favorite Huracán-^-,btohqsg
The Octavia VRS Kombi is basically a Golf GTI MK5 in wagon guise,btohqsg
from factory some have full airsus,btohqsg
so u could literally slam them,btohqsg
some euro style modding(personally think its cool but not my style of modding),btohqsg
i remember seeing her last ad,btohqsg
The lambo is a 1:24 I got from bangkok,btohqsg
U can check lazada and shopee,btohqsg
The main difference between this and the standard PC011 case is that it has that 5 inch screen behind that shows ur GPU or CPU temp and clock speed,btohqsg
not bad for brand by car company,btohqsg
this kind of case not really optimal btw,btohqsg
400 for a case with a lambo badge slapped on,btohqsg
just get a normal case and slap on your own stickers and bam,btohqsg
Bro on average how much is a Lambo logo pin,btohqsg
There is a a method to doing up the fans for these types of of cases  I used to build gaming rigs on a commercial basis for 5 years  before doing what I'm doing now,btohqsg
I like it  I can afford it. So why not,btohqsg
the case design by itself is nice tbvh,btohqsg
oh it comes with a display and all,btohqsg
ok 400 isnt insanely far fetched considering lambo tax and all.,btohqsg
Yup that extra 5 inch display is exclusive to this special edition,btohqsg
And the panels on the top and front which are SECC steel on the normal edition  are carbon fibre on the lambo edition,btohqsg
You just see how much is the Secretlab Lamborghini chair lol,btohqsg
I didn't buy the lambo chair because honestly I find gamer-design chairs like the kind Secretlab does  incredibly uncomfortable,btohqsg
Eh nice eh what is that,btohqsg
Mclaren 720s with a senna gtr bumper,btohqsg
this is the best photo ive ever taken,btohqsg
Sorry if it's a bit blur,btohqsg
That corvette was there like damn long ago,btohqsg
Ay thats the one i saw twice :D,btohqsg
orh horr never blur logo (satire),btohqsg
Rumor has it he delivers yong tau foo up Mt Faber every morning,btohqsg
throwback to this guy not believing its a suzuki,btohqsg
The jimny has some sick aftermarket options for bodykits,btohqsg
Gotta be the freakiest car enthusiast here,btohqsg
C7 the back is very different and was never made in RHD,btohqsg
we don't have any road registered C7s here,btohqsg
C7 was never made in RHD  all examples sold in AUS are aftermarket conversions,btohqsg
C8 is the 1st Corvette gen to have both LHD and RHD as factory options,btohqsg
Yeah we do have C2s and C3s in sg though,btohqsg
Those are usually RHD conversions imported from AUS,btohqsg
IIRC all the C2 and C3 on classic plates in SG are recent immigrants from AUS,btohqsg
you should start a ig/blog on the history of certain unicorns/special cars of sg,btohqsg
I not expert  got people more expert than me,btohqsg
I got one friend who somehow knows where all of SG GTR R32 to R34 are,btohqsg
There's one classic US car here in sg that is damn nice,btohqsg
Hahaha but nice to hear your opinions,btohqsg
Done up to look like KITT,btohqsg
I think this fella was put on sale a few times,btohqsg
At one point my friends used car company was trying to sell it a few years ago I think,btohqsg
is there a groupchat for bikes?,btohqsg
yeah I'm p sure they are rhd conversions,btohqsg
yes bodywork all just done up a few weeks back! he also owns a really cool bimmer  E31,btohqsg
Gotta love 1970s and 1980s American post oil crisis engine design,btohqsg
5 litre NA V8 doing 144hp,btohqsg
The Nissan 280ZX of that era was already doing 143hp out of a 2.8 inline6 NA engine,btohqsg
The turbo version of that 2.8 i6 engine did 180hp,btohqsg
To all all the LTA informants and plants in here,btohqsg
And to think I heard my friend kpkb about his 370z doing 7 to 8km/l,btohqsg
My car 1200hp lah sooo kinda obv,btohqsg
haha  i know of people getting sub 5 in WRXs,btohqsg
the EJ20s drink fuel like no tomorrow,btohqsg
though they are a HUGE blast to drive,btohqsg
Another friend of mine sold his Legacy BR9 Wagon because his wife kpkb about the fuel consumption,btohqsg
honestly the Legacys are a gem,btohqsg
i am massively biased towards them,btohqsg
but those are comfy  pretty nifty and good looking,btohqsg
It's basically what happens when WRX owner grows up and become gentleman,btohqsg
we had a BL5  those were fun,btohqsg
But damm that thing drinks Vpower like a drunkard in Zouk,btohqsg
and not to mention  they have held up really well aesthetically,btohqsg
I borrowed a friend's BL5 before as well once  when my Jetta was in the workshop for engine overhaul,btohqsg
Not so shiok when u look down and see the fuel gauge dropping like a rock,btohqsg
My wallet very pain refilling it with vpower before returning it to him,btohqsg
i feel the satisfaction of the EJ severely outweighs any financial burden VPower places upon you,btohqsg
even while cruising the boxer is magnificent to listen to,btohqsg
With great power comes great expenses,btohqsg
My Jetta I once had it on Stage 1 tune. It was fun when it works. But iirc I was replacing mechatronic every 1 to 2 years lol,btohqsg
When I renewed COE I reset the ECU back to stock,btohqsg
Some people will see the EJ's characteristics as worth the price of admission,btohqsg
"One friend with FD2R said ""some days you just need to point a gun to your head and tell yourself it's still worth it lol""",btohqsg
Some people look at it like ah waste of moneyYes  but did you enjoy it?,btohqsg
Boys and girls  this is what happen when you never study in school properly and remain stupidYou become LTA officer and spend your days with your pantat in the air while trying to hit quota,btohqsg
go in and start up the car,btohqsg
My friend is now in Nara  he saw this,btohqsg
Itasha Crown and Copen in background,btohqsg
2008 BMW M3$13 955 SOLID DEAL🔥Chassis number: YTEMP-100188343Located in Osaka  free storage in Kansai for 2 weeks😱Repaint option✅,btohqsg
I drove this car for my friends who ran Anime Festival Asia 2011,btohqsg
Oh yeah there was a Miku Corolla at one point,btohqsg
Borneo sponsored it for the event,btohqsg
They sponsored miku or vice versa back in like 2010,btohqsg
It was one of the very few Altis 1.8 in SG,btohqsg
Actually I got some cars to be shipped to Japan from SG,btohqsg
Aka it had the 1.8 engine from the Wish,btohqsg
And iirc it was the borneo motors showroom car so it had all the optional DLC like blue interior lighting etc,btohqsg
Yup this lady is a bot. Talk about delayed reaction,btohqsg
Man I'm new to the car scene,btohqsg
Literally baby compared to all u,btohqsg
Is your friend still running afa,btohqsg
It was probably one of the first few EV in SG,btohqsg
It had a range of 130km,btohqsg
I heard got new organizer that's why alot of things change,btohqsg
Which became 60km once u turn on the aircon lol,btohqsg
Wild idk what is good or bad,btohqsg
Yes it is still run by SOZO,btohqsg
It was zippy up to 50kmhAfter which it absolutely almost refused to accelerate any further,btohqsg
Im just a photographer that's all,btohqsg
This is a Nissan Fuga Y51,btohqsg
In export markets it is sold as Infiniti Q70,btohqsg
I fucking stupid when it comes to models of cars tbh,btohqsg
My friend's RX8 which sadly kena COE monster in 2020,btohqsg
I only know like standard shit,btohqsg
Takes practice and years from seeing various cars in games etc,btohqsg
I genuinely started only like last year car photography,btohqsg
I credit Initial D and Wangan Midnight with intro-ing me to JDM cars  along with Kaido Battle Racer and Gran Turismo,btohqsg
"MF ghost is basically ""oh illegal street racing is no longer fashionable  let's make it legit""",btohqsg
I will suggest you go and find the Wangan Midnight anime series to watch if u can find download,btohqsg
Ill probably watch on the way back to sg,btohqsg
The series is basically 2 guys who spend all the time vs each other on Tokyo's Wangan line,btohqsg
have full episodes on yt btw,btohqsg
With other people jumping in in every arc,btohqsg
Basically 130km was decent for a small EV in 2012  but would be considered dogshit today.A new Mini Cooper EV today can do 400km on a full charge,btohqsg
The BlueSG mini car iirc has a range of 250km on a full charge,btohqsg
It kind of shows how far EVs have come in 10 years of technological development,btohqsg
It also kind of show how EVs are more like applicances (like ur iPhone or ur laptop) rather than a car,btohqsg
If you renew the COE on a 2014 Altis and u drive alongside a 2024 Altis  you dont feel so bad. Sure  the 2024 Altis has abit more power and more toys and features in there  but you still have a very driveable car for less money,btohqsg
Renewing the COE on a 2014 EV is like trying to still use a iPhone 6 in 2024 when the iPhone 16 is sold in stores nowYou feel stupid doing so  because the 2024 EV model is SOOOOO much better,btohqsg
Oh sorry I forgot it's 2025 now lol,btohqsg
No one will renew EV. It doesn't makes sense at all.Tesla performance Road tax is 5.3kAfter 10 years renew? U have to be kidding. 10% more road is $530 more each year tax till it hit 50% more at $7950. 😂Plus old battery ? Old tech?No way.,btohqsg
Not to mention Tesla Performance PARF rebate after 10 years is likely 30K or even more (based on 50% of their ARF)I might as well take that 30k back use it as part of the deposit for something newer,btohqsg
ICE Cars from 30 to 40 years ago  they are classics with attributes about them that people know  love and appreciate,btohqsg
Nobody will want a 30 to 40 year old EV,btohqsg
It will be like you carrying Nokia 3310 in 2025  people think you siao,btohqsg
"It will be like u going to a IT show screaming ""look at my Pentium III desktop PC from 1999""",btohqsg
The red and black color is 🔥🔥,btohqsg
this the carbon agera rs right,btohqsg
The 5.0-litre V8 engine now has a power output of 1 176 PS (865 kW; 1 160 hp) on regular pump gasoline.,btohqsg
The agera rs can run on normal pump gas,btohqsg
that's why the Agera S was made; for countries without E85,btohqsg
but only 5 ever made so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,btohqsg
road tax meme from yesterday boutta come out,btohqsg
ROAD TAX IS SO FUCKING EXPENSIVEEEE,btohqsg
"this one is one of the ""road tax mafia""@SoranPryde🤣",btohqsg
"""finish ur homework rn""""dah finish liao""",btohqsg
MY FB history just alerted me of this old photo I took 9 years ago. This was sitting in Regent Motors (the Ford distributor at that time),btohqsg
Regent Motors is still around but of course the only thing they sell now is Ford Ranger trucks and the MustangRIP Ford cars for the masses,btohqsg
"https://youtu.be/WjMcYuQrrkUThe car that was so imbar in American Le Mans Series  Porsche went screaming ""MUM  BMW IS CHEATING IN THE EXAM!!!""",btohqsg
Wait anyone has pics of a 2017 Ford GT,btohqsg
Looks like one of my friend's cat but the cat pass away last year in march around 21 years old,btohqsg
This one hangs around 806 French rd the kopitiam  should be quite elderly  she has been there since I started work in 2017 in that area,btohqsg
And the locals love her  they let her sit on the chair like that,btohqsg
And then there is this fella at my block  who is the Lord of Emotional Blackmail.Every day this old lady will come down  he acts cute and she sits on the parapet and lets him sit in her wheelchair,btohqsg
Hope to see u   u all tonight,btohqsg
Looks like one of the stray cats downstairs my house,btohqsg

This fella hangs around Pioneer Mall,btohqsg
There is also this fella around the area as well  but apparently these 2 voids dont get along lol,btohqsg
We apologise hooman but the shower stall is full,btohqsg
Hmm I guess this cat is a ragdoll or something?,btohqsg
How much is the hp on this?,btohqsg
HP is dependent on how much fud and snacc is given. Additional burst of speed is provided by catnip injection kit,btohqsg
Spotted this amg gt in shanghai last month,btohqsg
Shanghai is a heaven in gen,btohqsg
Saw a lot of Maybach there  they're common sight there,btohqsg
Spotted this awhile back ps bad photo  was in a rush,btohqsg
YO IK THT CAT isnt tht beside pioneer mall?,btohqsg
It's the black cat that always hangs out around blk 637's void deck area next to pioneer mall,btohqsg
There is this fella also but they don't get along (seen them stare down each other b4) so I think this fella moved to a few blocks away from Pioneer mall,btohqsg
Oh i didnt even know thr was 2,btohqsg
i passed there before but I forgot where it was,btohqsg
this is a nice loaf of void,btohqsg
ah ok bc I think my dad gets his tyres or like serviced around thr,btohqsg
apparently its just a mainly vans meet,btohqsg

when in doubt we go to arjun,btohqsg
is there any muscle cars in sg other than the mustangs?,btohqsg
here's an 812 for yall to compare with,btohqsg
we have the ford gt40 too,btohqsg
Anyone have pics of the 2017 Ford GT,btohqsg
I know we have 1 in the country,btohqsg
mostly fords  sg got one ford galaxie on classic plates,btohqsg
It's probably hiding in a bonded warehouse because LHD,btohqsg
lowk praying that a hellcat or a charger comes in sg but idk if theres any rhd,btohqsg
Both versions of the Ford GT only came in LHD,btohqsg
I remember we have a hellcat but idk where it went,btohqsg
and a chevrolet impala  '62 if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
I don't think a hellcat or charger is worth the import + rhd swap,btohqsg
all the dodge u see on the roads are most likely Malaysia registered,btohqsg
ahh yeah i saw a few hellcat in kl b4,btohqsg
Any hellcat that is RHD is likely a AUS conversion,btohqsg
any1 spot a countach in sg b4?,btohqsg
sg got both LP and LPi,btohqsg
I don't think we have any registered LPi though,btohqsg
I believe there is one countach on classic plate,btohqsg
wait theres registered lp in sg?,btohqsg
but there's a nice red LPi on silver(?) wheels at LK,btohqsg
Diablo there used to be one black one on black plate  but that was many years ago always park funan basement,btohqsg
Dunno where that fella went to,btohqsg
Coming out soon! Car was under works for a few years  I think now all done up?,btohqsg

I love that black holy shit,btohqsg
The first production car to hit 200mph,btohqsg
599 GTB  488 GTB  296 GTB and a I8,btohqsg
there was an issue with the carter motor. but while finding what the issue was everything else was fixed up and now it's super mint,btohqsg
no more big SV sticker iinw,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure the rhd one:1 isnt in sg,btohqsg
There was only one rhd version made,btohqsg
like 1 in the whole world,btohqsg
Koenigsegg is not a fan of making track only cars or race cars,btohqsg
oh ya is there any koenigsegg displayed in sg? no right,btohqsg
I know we have the Medusa,btohqsg
The one and only time they built a race car  they got burnt by the homologation rules and Christian vonKoenigseggsaid fuck it never again,btohqsg
like in a dealership or just visible to the public eye lah,btohqsg
only got 5 koenigsegg in sg right?,btohqsg
All theKoenigseggsthat are either road registered or bonded are either hiding in private garages or bonded warehouses,btohqsg
Do u have 10 million dollars in ur pocket,btohqsg

The S is the blue one,btohqsg
4th one is like an urban legend liao,btohqsg
Agera S  went to koenigsegg for upgrades and now it's called the S+,btohqsg
i forgot if any is some other letter,btohqsg
we have alot of 25th ani also,btohqsg
aw man no rhd at all?,btohqsg
Christian von Koenigsegg decided he didn't need to go racing to sell his cars,btohqsg
Unlike Ferrari  whose reason for selling cars is so thar Scuderia Ferrari can go racing,btohqsg
not js for sg but globally,btohqsg
but from the very limited photos it looks damn good,btohqsg
there's apparently one more RS in sg,btohqsg

i dunno where u heard gemera from but ok buddy,btohqsg
