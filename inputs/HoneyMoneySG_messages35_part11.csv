Hi  one question about the DBS women's card  I got both women and world women card  are these two cards both have seperate 2k spend limit for their bonus point?,btohqsg
I remember i tried to add in apple pay before and it's didnt worked. some card cannot add to apple pay. But anyway when u want start to use amaze card  it's much easier that u can use the physical card to tap or u fill in the card detail with online purchase.,btohqsg
Amaze can only be added to Google Pay. If you're using iPhone can only tap with physical Amaze card,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I have received amaze card except for crmc so I am curious.,btohqsg
Which card do you all usually use to tagged for the fairprice app to pay in kopitiam ?,btohqsg
I use Citi rewards and HSBC revolution on my fairprice app. When paying in kopitiam I select my HSBC card  although not sure if it gets 4mpd  but I know my Citi rewards doesn't get 4mpd for kopitiam payments,btohqsg
Do HSBC revolution card get 4mpd when using it to pay insurance?,btohqsg
Insurance is excluded. You can use Maybank Platinum or BOC Family instead,btohqsg
only specific MCCs have 4mpd for offline spend.,btohqsg
Can you share some that qualify?,btohqsg
dbs woman's card only give 5× points for max $1k eligible online spend,btohqsg
Hsbc revolution card buy flight ticket ontrip.comcan get 10x point rewards?,btohqsg
Anyone notices this under UOB EVOL T&C  W.e.f. 1 March 2022  please be informed that transactions with the transaction description “AMAZE* TRANSIT*” will be excluded from the awarding of cashback.,btohqsg
No sure if it also applies to XNAP  as it shown as XNAP*,btohqsg
uob evol is a visa card.,btohqsg
I saw online that Trust Bank Card may work really well with the fairprice app. Unsure if it's true.,btohqsg
Extra 8% cashback for groceries and 6% for kopitiam. Min $800,btohqsg
I tagged mine to my Trust Bank CC,btohqsg
Worth to apply for trust card for overseas txns if I alr have youtrip?,btohqsg
Fx spread is probably the same but trust gives 0.22% rebates for non FP transactions while you trip doesn’t give anything,btohqsg
Please correct me if I’m wrong,btohqsg
Not really.I stay near a Sheng Siong outlet and purposely bought $875 worth of Sheng Siong vouchers.Then I slowly used it for my daily grocery shopping at any Sheng Siong outlets.Now  everything I bought at Sheng Siong is at an 8% discount. Plus the vouchers never expire.,btohqsg
Is the same cashback available if I buy NTUC vouchers?,btohqsg

Check HSBC covered but uib one seen to be no,btohqsg
Any way to earn cashback for paying insurance??,btohqsg
No idea  never tried that before,btohqsg
I’ve done some research regarding XNAP  CRMC and Apple Pay/Google Pay.You can’t add Amaze to Apply pay. So you can only CRMC -> Apply Pay -> XNAP. After digging around it seems that only a very particular MCC fashion is eligible for 4mpd. So if you want to earn 4mpd using XNAP on iPhone  have to use other cards that gives reward on online transaction without using Amaze card like HSBC  UOB and etc.So Android users benefit this the most. You can MasterCard -> Amaze -> Google Pay -> XNAP. And you can earn your rewards include 4mpd if you using any of those card Chris mentioned.,btohqsg
Slipped off my tongue  Apple pay CRMC should not get 4 mpd on XNAP,btohqsg
Instarem amaze has no love for iPhones,btohqsg
Depends how much do you spend on hawker food. Amoy street food center has a lot merchants that accept ShopBack. So you don’t lose out much if your workplace is around the area.,btohqsg
Just say get a android for the flexibility,btohqsg
But I’m going to try something super mafan. I have a friend who just upgraded his android phone cause it has green lines on his display.I’m going to inherit his android phone  do all the Amaze  Google Pay and XNAP on that spare phone.It’s not uncommon for people to carry two phones around anyway.,btohqsg
Do we need to keep $500 in our RHB account to avoid the fall below fee and presumably get the bonus interest from last month?,btohqsg
Based on what I know  no need. But you can call their hotline to confirm again. The line is quite responsive,btohqsg
On HSBC EGA  isit true that 1% rebate for Giro  applies only when Giro application is made via hardcopy  and not via online applications? Was told by HSBC Staff. So backwards one.,btohqsg
Affirm no need  my rhb saving account  less than $100 still yield interest,btohqsg
When will part 2 of the miles v cashback be out?,btohqsg
