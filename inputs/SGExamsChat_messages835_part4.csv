I'm using a second hand 6800,btohqsg
but I want a x3d CPU,btohqsg

AMD Ryzen vs Intelnowadays which one better ah?,btohqsg
I never follow for some time,btohqsg
flight sim benefit from x3d alot,btohqsg
depends on what u wna do ig,btohqsg
Intel 13th and 14th gen have been breaking lol,btohqsg
i load microsoft powerpoint on my 4090,btohqsg
I load 20 Excel sheets on my 4090,btohqsg
altho hor tbh unless you need ray tracing,btohqsg
I wld prefer an AMD GPU,btohqsg
I mean the higher end ones can alrdy do ray tracing mostly thr,btohqsg
Unless u want play cp2077 or smth which is just nvidia marketing lol,btohqsg
honestly I feel ray tracing damn fluff,btohqsg
nvidia works better for my purposes but it’s p niche,btohqsg
otherwise i’d always say amd rn,btohqsg
that’s one part of it yea,btohqsg
but other stuff of my research lor,btohqsg
navigating it with AMD is a pain,btohqsg
U know what is also a pain,btohqsg
man needed his TA to escort him to the pickup area,btohqsg
Lesson learnt: never stand up for yourself,btohqsg
then came into the exam hall for midterms in crutches,btohqsg
wow taking sg taxpayer money is so innovative,btohqsg
huh Ubisoft Singapore planning another Triple A (AAA) game??,btohqsg
their Skulls and Bones one had so much publicity and promotion before the game's release but there was barely on socmed(social media) compared to other games that aren't even AAA,btohqsg
lol i rmb my friend showed me...i was like  they actually did that,btohqsg
the question setter must be strongly influenced by Gyatt,btohqsg
Ubisoft even dare say skulls and bones is the first “AAAA” game. Literally a slap to SG gov.,btohqsg
Can I ask  for Olevel social studies  is it a compulsory requirement to take? Is it part of the optional humanities when u choose that or geography or history ?,btohqsg
You can drop everything but the main 4,btohqsg
You can't drop English Maths Science or mother tongue.Everything else you can don't turn up for examsElectives and Humanities,btohqsg
you can drop subjects choosing not to take during O/N levels i think,btohqsg
Then ite need how many subjects?,btohqsg
"Drop also goes two ways ""Don't turn up for class test/exams/lessons  turn up only for O levels""Or go through the official route of informing the school",btohqsg
EMB3 and L1R4 come from the same concept rightcalculating the aggregate points of a student's Os or Ns exam scores from 5 subjects,btohqsg
if you're an Os & N(A)s  student  you still need the bare minimum aka 5 subjects to scoreif you're an N(T) student  4 minimum subjects can alr,btohqsg
All you need is 5 subjects that you can use to go ite or poly,btohqsg
Out of these 5  4 of it must be eng  maths  science and mt,btohqsg
Yep  the difference is the relevant and Best subjects,btohqsg
Ye the relevant subj might need humans,btohqsg
finally you answered right with the focus shifted back to the question,btohqsg
if ur sec 4 this year  j don't think you can drop subjects anymore,btohqsg
sec 3 still have some time to think about it,btohqsg
You can drop by just not attending lessons or go by the official way of informing the school,btohqsg
yeah except L1R4 you don’t rlly need to compute math (but your math still matters because E8 math cannot go poly),btohqsg
same with N’s  your english cannot hit at least B3 also cannot go poly,btohqsg
based on grade conversion B3 in n levels is like D7 in o levels,btohqsg
