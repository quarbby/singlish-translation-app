Ya i also kana this problem  also like to know about it,btohqsg
my booking on the app is 164.72. UOB settled txn is 166.37,btohqsg
Hi for webull promotion usd 10000/ sgd 13800  meaning i can also deposit sgd  no need to convert right?,btohqsg
That's quite good already  they charge you only 1% instead of 5%.,btohqsg
yeah  i suppose that's fair! do yall usually select that option? ðŸ˜‚ or just the book now  pay now  or use other platforms?thanks for sharing Melvyn! i was reading reddit too and seedly on it,btohqsg
Is anyone experiencing payment unsuccessfully but paying Singtel bill using amaze physical card today? I selected the credit card/ debit card via axs just now bit the payment not successful.,btohqsg
1% difference is DCC fee (dynamic currency conversion). This happened when payment gateway is overseas but the change is in sgd. Agoda payment gateway for Mastercard is in HK so DCC happens.,btohqsg
Or I can just use CRMC to make the payment? Is this still considered online payment?,btohqsg
Bill payment via axs will be excluded I think,btohqsg
CRMC on Singtel app is already considered online.,btohqsg
No way for me to avoid paying the $25 when I redeem my miles for Citi rewards card?,btohqsg
I thought Amaze cannot be used on AXS since long time ago?,btohqsg
Anyone here had or currently have both Citi Prestige and DBS Vantage card? Which one would you pick to use personally?,btohqsg
In grand scheme of redeeming business class  pay 25 ok la...,btohqsg
I have both. I use all the specialised cards (4mpd/3-8% cash back)  maxed those first then likely for excess spend  Vantage since 1.5mpd.Prestige card is more benefits driven. It is a great card to keep in your arsenal for PayAll promotions and for 4th night free hotel bookings. Also Priority Pass 1+1 unlimited.Edit: Vantage annual fee can be waived with $60k spending annually. Prestige I have never gotten waiver before.,btohqsg
In your view  do you find both cards to have overlapping benefits? Like for example Unlimited PP (prestige) versus 10 PP (vantage); GHA Titanium (prestige) versus Accor Plus (vantage)? Also Iâ€™d assume you pay for hotels and plane tix using your Vantage card after you have maxed out your specialized cards?Thanks for your insights bro!,btohqsg

You are opening a huge can of worms for me to fill the chat now hahaVantage PP has 10 per AF period and that can be used for others as well. If you bring your family  you can use those passes for them too. Prestige is nice since you can just go with your spouse and it fits nicely. Not to mention hop around the terminals for free food at restaurants (Crystal Jade) if you want to and still be able to get into the lounge fuss free. Frankly boarding time max 2.5hrs ahead so damage is also limited :pOk on to GHA vs Accor. I find GHA to have nicer hotels and Accor membership loses in that respect. However  you do get one night free at most Accor properties and if you like buffet  the Accor membership has 50% discounts occasionally at some hotel buffets which is quite nice to bring the family for a binge at about $50 per head.For payment for air tickets  I will look at if I have enough ThankYou points to redeem the flight and put it on Prestige since it provides free travel insurance from Master Card. The point to note is that the redemption points needs to all come from Citibank.Otherwise  it is free for all and should max out specialised cards since Vantage does not give free coverage on travel insurance.,btohqsg
Thanks bro. This really helped me gained a lot of insights and firmed my decision. Thanks a lot.,btohqsg
One last question to help you decide. Do you CardUp a lot?If you do  Vantage is your best friend.,btohqsg

Any cards giving good offers for Netflix subscription please,btohqsg
I'm using amaze + citi rewards,btohqsg
One question. Is it really true that credit score does not matter in SG  only in US?,btohqsg
Oh thank you unfortunately I didn't plan well and my amaze card has hit 1000 for this month,btohqsg
Pop it into HSBC Live+ if you have the card. 8% cash back but need to spend min $600 per month for a calendar quarter.,btohqsg
Oh thank you. I don't have the card as I see there were no promo code for it recently.,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Hmm.. I have heard of it but havenâ€™t really used it. Gonna explore a bit.,btohqsg
I think have promotion and can use Chrisâ€™ link. If youâ€™re new to the card  just need to spend $1k to unlock 8% for the whole calendar quarter.Frankly this card is so good it is one of the fastest that get maxed for me.MCC 5311 ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
If you CardUp  the AF for the Vantage can easily be waived. Just put your mortgage  tax etc into it.Free hotel stay every year plus Accor renewal.No such benefit for Prestige.,btohqsg
hiya! just checking - is the combo of instarem amaze with citirewards card still working? or should i just go for the citi cashback+ / other cashback cards instead? am a fresh grad! (lower min spent would be ideal!),btohqsg
how much is enough for annual fee waiver for dbs vantageï¼Ÿ,btohqsg
so would you recommend just going for that combo? or maybe just get a citi cashback+ for a more 'brainless' approach when spending hahaalso  am new to CCs  do these combos get modified/nerfed relativelyy quickly? or is this instarem/citirewards combo to stay?,btohqsg
Donâ€™t think it overlaps.Use prestige for 4NF + lounge hoppingUse vantage for accorplus + lounge when traveling with whole family  further vantage 2nd year can get free waiver if spending is enough. Iâ€™ve gotten waiver for two years so itâ€™s like a free card.For 4NF can get enough rebate to cover the annual fee.If you feel you travel to places that you can use 4NF  prestige is worth it.If you spend enough on cardup via vantage  2nd year onwards is really free for u so why not vantage too,btohqsg
Citi rewards + amaze is as brain dead as it can get. Dont use it to book flights or hotels etc and thats all.Nerf we cant do anything.,btohqsg
I fully agree. The 2 cards combo very well together.,btohqsg
#egaOk. Hsbc said cashback for giro to ega will come in tomorrow. Letâ€™s wait and see.,btohqsg
Oh yes just saw it. However  I noticed that the singsaver promo for travelone seems to be worse than the one from hsbc though.,btohqsg
Then use it to redeem for what?,btohqsg
Go to Citi website to redeem for vouchers? Thatâ€™s if u feel that the transfer fee isnâ€™t worth it,btohqsg
You can choose either bank or Singsaver option ðŸ˜ŠIf youâ€™re new to HSBC  Live+ and TravelOne can double dip since HSBC counts them separately for sign up rewards.Personally I find the TravelOne card to be quite anaemic in benefits but ok to sign up just for the rewards if you want.,btohqsg
But the whole point of the card is for miles ma haha. If redeem vouchers for stores and food confirm not worth it,btohqsg
Then canâ€™t complain about the transfer fees lo ðŸ¤—,btohqsg
If you really want  can also redeem cash back but take note. If youâ€™re not redeeming from a 4mpd card (Citi Rewards)  the rate is terrible. CRMC earn rate will give you around 2.27% cash back.,btohqsg
Thanks boss! You asked what I wanted to ask. ðŸ¥³,btohqsg
Can go to app and check. There are many vouchers.Miles are better values ofc but this is an option.,btohqsg
How long will it roughly take to get 10000 miles from this card,btohqsg
lol  exact same reply for EGA previously. From 1 November extend until 8 November alrd  tmr probably canâ€™t be done and they will just change the date to 15 Nov and so on,btohqsg
Hi guys  FYII just called HSBC to ask why the Everyday+ rewards for Giro payment is not yet in even after so many days. The bank says that they experiencing some IT issue and apologised for the delay. They mentioned that the every+ rewards programme payouts will resume once their IT issue had been fixed.,btohqsg
