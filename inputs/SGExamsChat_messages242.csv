damn being homeschool makes u progress faster than schools huh,btohqsg
school is actl a damn waste of time,btohqsg
a lot of classroom time is spent on discipline and admin,btohqsg

Ever find yourself browsing Buzzfeed and taking personality tests and quizzes defining your future careers/pathways? 📝 But do these personalities (results like ENTP  ISFP and INFJ)  accurately define you as a person? 🧐This month’s Tribute Thursday article aims to shed light on this topic - that you are more than what personality and career tests define about you. Link in bio. 🤩Read the full article on our Medium:medium.com/SGExams.,btohqsg
Happy Mother's Day! Remember to spend some time with your moms and to show your appreciation for them 🤱❤,btohqsg
anyone has h1 physics tutorial qns?,btohqsg
Does eae use prelim exam marks as well  or only mid years,btohqsg
ok urm im not too sure if this is considered deemed to put in the study grp chat but someone please help.. is 0 a natural no or not..in a lecture video it said sequence is a(0) a(1) etc using a(n) where n is a natural number (suggesting that in this case 0 is natural??)but in our lecture  our teacher told us 0 is not a natural number. so someone help..,btohqsg
If you look at the syllabus doc  the list of symbols used does not have the set of natural numbers,btohqsg
They'll say positive integers  or nonnegative integers,btohqsg
This is because natural numbers is a contentious term and half of people thinks it should have 0 and another half doesn't,btohqsg
So u don't have to worry about that,btohqsg
At least not in national exams anyway,btohqsg
In school I think you just follow your teacher,btohqsg
Tbh it's quite bad practice to use the term natural numbers without defining it anyway,btohqsg
he was also confused with what hes saying,btohqsg
"There's ""positive integers"" and ""non negative integers""",btohqsg
hes like urm idk 0 shouldnt be natural but sometimes it is,btohqsg
If he confused then I also dunno what to do already,btohqsg
ehh I wouldn't be worried about it,btohqsg
generally use 0 unless qn states so we planning to do that,btohqsg
just ask him directly what natural numbers are defined to be,btohqsg
then just take what he says,btohqsg
They see Ur achievement and not results,btohqsg
Doesnt mean end of world. Still got chance to flip de,btohqsg
eh my sch said they see MYE ones leh?,btohqsg
If uw link for idk wat,btohqsg

"Usually either(1) It does not matter OR(2) It is implied.If you are not sure  just use ""the set of positive integers"" or ""the set of non-negative integers"" where appropriate.For example  I am currently doing a measure theory module which always excludes 0. But my algebra professor loves to include 0 because 0 is the additive identity. So just look at what it implies.Just ask yourself one question: if I include 0  would it still make sense?Same goes with subset  ⊂ and ⊆ can mean the same thing.I have been dealing with this for years with no issue. So I don't think you will have a major issue.",btohqsg
This is a recent assignment that I did. Had the set of natural numbers include 0  it wouldn't make sense as we would have 1/0 (look at the way I defined E_(k n)).,btohqsg
Too busy with assignments and other work hahaha,btohqsg
tho mine is not thay hahaha im in comp sci,btohqsg
no omg dood im not that pro,btohqsg
I didn't really like the basics of real analysis. But I like measure theory for some reason. Maybe because it's more abstract.,btohqsg
is there anyone that is in NUS CS?,btohqsg
she needs to interview people in NUS CS,btohqsg
That's the kind of detail you should have asked first LOL,btohqsg
not entirely friend paiseh cuz shes asking then i happen to just ask ard i guess,btohqsg
Topic : ?And Why only nus cs 😅,btohqsg
oh wait nvm is need to be graduated NUS CS,btohqsg
sorry i boomer uh but how to add flair?,btohqsg
i think just the [o levels] will do,btohqsg
i think it'll auto add the flair for u,btohqsg
btw MBTI is not a scientific measure and is not accepted by psychologists,btohqsg
Hi hello! I’m actually interested in joining mass Communication in NP  but I don’t get what’s the different between mass com and mass Com management. Is there anyone who can help me?,btohqsg
is there a mass comm management? or do u mean mass media management in nyp or comms and media management in tp?,btohqsg
Ah yes mass media management in NYP,btohqsg
I think a cursory comparison of the two course modules shows that mass media management has a lot more modules focused on the 'business' aspect of things  while mass comm focuses more on the technical skills of comms,btohqsg
Oh I c  so do you do like banking stuff in management like poa?,btohqsg
not exactly  the only more mathy module I can see is media financial management,btohqsg
agree^ mass comm in np focuses alot of the skills needed to help you become a well rounded individual who is able to write  film  edit  and analyse the media industry although we do have a module called media entrepreneurship in y3 focusing on how to create a media startup,btohqsg
yup but it's one module only  for mass media management I think almost 40-50% is focused on the business side of things,btohqsg
I think in the end is what u value more,btohqsg
Ooo okay cuz I’m quite worried to enter mass media management as my maths and poa is really bad and mass communication is only available in a few poly.,btohqsg
damn 24 community cases  6 unlinked,btohqsg
hopefully remove common last topic uwu,btohqsg
i wish  but may not happen here. cuz they'll say u guys had time to prepare for it,btohqsg
if anything we face 2 CBs so technically less time as the previous batch,btohqsg
kinda sad you gguys hv to do it during this time,btohqsg
CB actually gives much more time to study,btohqsg
Provided the school is willing to upload the resources for things they have yet to cover online in advance,btohqsg
Unless you decide to screw urself over by playing during cb,btohqsg
i mean everyone is at home,btohqsg
Dont worry too much! I had F9 for O lvls back in 2015 and i did stats and accounting in Poly. It was manageable la dont worry too much. Im sure u would do just fine :),btohqsg
Now that i said it out. I feel damn old,btohqsg
Ohhh made me feel so much better hahaha  thanks 😂,btohqsg
Don’t worry you’re not old  just more matured ;),btohqsg
But i did part time diploma. Do keep that in mind.,btohqsg
Not rlly    sometimes they give online resources may not be understandable,btohqsg
then u end up figuring things out    then whatver u figure out is wrong SOMEMORE 😢🤡,btohqsg
Actually the only resources u kind of need access to are question banks,btohqsg
Content wise resources r available everywhere,btohqsg
"BREAKING: Singapore will tighten social interactions further  reducing the cap for group sizes from 5 to 2 from this Sunday.https://cna.asia/3yduGD9Dining in will cease  with F&B outlets offering only takeaway and delivery options. Wedding receptions will also not be allowed.The multi-ministry task force says it is ""concerning"" that the number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and unlinked community cases have continued to increase.",btohqsg
Assuming how the issue will progress in the next two weeks  we may go back to phase 1 or CB but low chance cb,btohqsg
Final gathering for group tuition tml,btohqsg

then rmb check the opening hours too,btohqsg
idw go raffles hospital mingle with others,btohqsg
so I went to my sash 5 mins before they closed,btohqsg
I gg simlim collect stuff ma. So shunbian at raffles swab,btohqsg
Bloody hell. When i wanna park at unloading bay no space. Then when i walk out from carpark got space at unloading bay,btohqsg
Hahaha I got swabbed twice because I was at T3 on 3rd May,btohqsg
Yeah  T3 and T1 are completely dead  with the exception of passengers,btohqsg
Jewel was just eerie to look at,btohqsg
Tbh I wanna explore closed areas,btohqsg
No one says u cant tho,btohqsg
The police do  if you come Jewel,btohqsg
Explore sungei tengah. I like to go there alone,btohqsg
Then a lot of fish shops,btohqsg
The house is a closed area,btohqsg
Just why would you torture me like that,btohqsg

hi guys here to ask about smth so like my sch got send us email about june internship to the s3s (which is my batch) so i’m thinking whether to sign up or not. my concern is that i may want to use june hol and like chill and hopefully catch up on some hobbies and revise  but then internship seems to be a good opportunity to learn irl life skill and stuff. not sure which to choose  what do u guys think?,btohqsg
what would be the priority for you? is it possible for you to intern and also chill/study after work hours?,btohqsg
intern isnt easy to get in this time period so you should take the chance,btohqsg
personally for me intern is more impt ah,btohqsg
i think possible  tho i don’t know the exact schedule of the internship cos i havent like sign up w them yet,btohqsg
if there are no impt exams coming up soon  then studying definitely takes a back seat,btohqsg
intern experience can be q eye opening at sec 3,btohqsg
yall got go intern b4? can share exp haha,btohqsg
go and see if they interest u i guess,btohqsg
for me is you mostly get thrown into the deep end  learn how to do things by yourself  google is your best friend,btohqsg
but probably sec 3 they probably wont expect too much,btohqsg
what kind of intern did u do?,btohqsg
more for you to shadow and learn,btohqsg
Which is a good thing ah  learn the more practical side of the job responsibilities,btohqsg
teaching intern and other jobs and stuff,btohqsg
depends la  shadow also can learn a lot if u damn proactive,btohqsg
i heard usually younger people do work shadow cos its shorter period,btohqsg
But u can personally extend it if u can negotiate with ur employer/supervisor,btohqsg
how i did it was to do the small tasks really well and slowly gain trust from supervisor then u get big tasks,btohqsg
Sec 3 hard to get internship wihout connections ah  so shadowing still ok i suppose,btohqsg
ya... only the top sec schs get intern opportunities,btohqsg
can also  just sec 3 a bit the hard,btohqsg
write a damn good cover letter,btohqsg
cold emails worked q well for me,btohqsg
@sovietseagullwell wtv the case  maybe u wanna inquire more details abt the internship at the organisations u eyeing for,btohqsg
they say intern so probably is,btohqsg
i think  research is one of the hardest roles lol,btohqsg
how did the person get in lol,btohqsg
Most likely  but that alone isnt enough cuz research,btohqsg
So far so good  i wan sleep cuz mye this monday,btohqsg
but this kind of intern how to get in,btohqsg
Then go thru rounds of interview,btohqsg
Need give portfolio and ur outstanding grades,btohqsg
is it long term intern tho sounds like it would demand q a bit of commitment,btohqsg
Some are 1 month  some are up to 3 or 4 months,btohqsg
A*star minimum attachment is 2 months i think,btohqsg
Then got other organisations need find somehow,btohqsg
i see  probably out of my depth rn,btohqsg
not much of a ‘portfolio’ to look at,btohqsg
Isokay  just source other types of internships ur interested looking into,btohqsg
probably don’t have a lot of time for them when sch starts cos its also q busy,btohqsg
which would make intern-seeking vv difficult anyways,btohqsg
Its up to u to make the best decision for urself,btohqsg
PM admins for permission before advertising please,btohqsg
Sorry boss. Dun ban me uwu,btohqsg

I did 6 unpaid ones and 2 paid ones before graduating. Got a return and it was worth,btohqsg
Now hard to find an internship,btohqsg
