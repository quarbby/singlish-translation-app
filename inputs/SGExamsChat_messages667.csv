I'm trilingual but equally bad at all 3 ü§°,btohqsg
everywhere...i need this to get the practising license,btohqsg
i didnt give a shit of my chinese grade at As,btohqsg
but how to speak medical terms in chinese,btohqsg
my chinese went bad until i cant even write a dosing instruction,btohqsg
meanwhile my brother got E8 in hcl and have to take chinese in jc,btohqsg
fml u more qualified than me,btohqsg
i tot it will be paper 2 that usually pull the people down,btohqsg
but his school had quite high passing rate though,btohqsg
meanwhile i got merit for oral in As but ended up w a D,btohqsg
i must have failed either paper 1/2 real badly,btohqsg
BUT i got merit due to the topic being a repetition of my prelim,btohqsg
i still remembered i still went for work before collecting results (coz not yet 3 months need unpaid leave),btohqsg
my chinese was so bad that i was placed in the last class for chinese,btohqsg
the teacher used english to teach us chinese,btohqsg
how hopeless is the current generation with their chi now,btohqsg
"it was the ""just get an S for h1 cl and move on"" class",btohqsg
I remembered there was once in sec sch  the whole cohort max score is B4,btohqsg
got a 1h lecture from hod,btohqsg
id argue that there's no intention from the education perspective to make the language interesting to learn,btohqsg
but those other MTs still doing quite ok i think,btohqsg
all we do is write compos and answer li jie wen da,btohqsg
idk how my friend got A for GP,btohqsg
welp havent seen a single chinese word in my uni education so,btohqsg
only for me to enter the working world and then my supervisor laughing at my chinese,btohqsg
well at least there's motivation to learn it now,btohqsg
i keep asking my supervisor what is xxx in chinese,btohqsg
happy early book out tomorrow to our recootsü´°ü´°,btohqsg
now i also ps submit the form saying i cannot write chinese,btohqsg
tbh my chinese speaking level is prolly at sec 2 stage hahaha,btohqsg
if chinese becomes a much more dominant language in the future do you think you can survive,btohqsg
should try going to karaoke and singing more chinese songs AHAH its like a good way to practice,btohqsg
the real china studies in english,btohqsg
english is so much easier to speak,btohqsg
that's cuz we were taught at a young age as compared to chinese,btohqsg
and it was/is much more normalised than chinese,btohqsg
but chinese is still quite famous i feel,btohqsg
i havent had a single person come up to me and tell me they want to learn chinese,btohqsg
its always i want to learn korean or japanese or german or any other language,btohqsg
i want to learn how to curse like enciks,btohqsg

i had to ask three profs to write letters of recommendation for some of my apps,btohqsg
meanwhile im not close to any prof:-(,btohqsg
just dig deep to see who‚Äôs most suitable? profs wise a lot of them will still be willing to help if you don‚Äôt have better options bc they know you need it,btohqsg
true  over time i have slowly realised that there is no point arguing with stubborn people over the internet. if u know u r right  and u throw facts at people and they still don‚Äôt want to change their opinion  then just stop wasting ur time  energy and mood. they are not your mother  father  not someone that you care about  not even your dog  don‚Äôt need to put in extra effort to educate them,btohqsg

Eventually most of the questions will get repetitive although there will still be some hard ones or concepts Cambridge never tested before in Tys. But sch prelims may have tested before,btohqsg
I CANT LEAVE BIO (i hated bio like 30 mins ago),btohqsg

WHY IS THE BALLS GUY NOT ACTIVE ANYMORE üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°,btohqsg
i purposely retweeted posts of people self harming and pictures of the aftermath of school shootings,btohqsg
then got my twittet acc suspended,btohqsg

bc twitter allows a lot of kinds of sensitive content,btohqsg
florals was one of ur disc names i think,btohqsg
no i say u supposed to call me florals,btohqsg
my entire dc account got banned,btohqsg
i still use twitter lol  i love using it for news and political discussions n can also talk abt controversial stuff without getting shadowbanned,btohqsg
oh my ig never got suspended before,btohqsg
i actually purposely deleted my ig fan acc with over 800 followers,btohqsg
no regrets btw i dont care abt social media followings lol,btohqsg
Omg yay a levels results are soon,btohqsg
Time to see if my predictions are correct,btohqsg
guys my og is glazing on one indian dude now,btohqsg

i think I register for retake now,btohqsg
Hold your horses. If it turns out you don‚Äôt need retake  please spend all the money saved to buy me HDL üôèüèº,btohqsg
IF it turns out I don't need retake,btohqsg
If all my classes get 60% distinction for gp I'll treat them hdl,btohqsg
Cuz I have one class 70% china scholars,btohqsg
But gp w incentive or not i cant,btohqsg
Eh dun be surprised  in sec sch  my cohort top in english is a china scholar,btohqsg
Uk the good thing is that you don't have to exactly speak like how you write,btohqsg
Yea but my language fr pri sch to now is hopeless,btohqsg
To increasingly stationary quality of life,btohqsg
Sec sch... Don't they memorize essays then spit out,btohqsg

fr JC days with the boys were simulation of adults lim kopi,btohqsg
and i accidentally slammed the door jn,btohqsg
i psycho myself  and i was prepared to sign on,btohqsg

get comfortable with back plans i guess,btohqsg
not at all  my predicted was 81/82,btohqsg
idk i want to run for class comm but then im not vibing with my class that much,btohqsg
then i minus a bit  i was expecting 78,btohqsg
i feel like going back to y4,btohqsg
i cant remember but around 78-82 at most,btohqsg
i feel like going back to sleep,btohqsg
but percentile wise  i was rabz,btohqsg
definitely  the moderation will work in your favour,btohqsg
im gonna go down and up again,btohqsg
but also after prelims  is when people start studying way more seriously so you definitely have done better too mah,btohqsg
one must imagine sisyphus as a fm studrnt,btohqsg
where's my double 90 rp gang,btohqsg
As an ex-fm student  I do not identify myself as Sisyphus. I was under the boulder 24/7,btohqsg
when i collected my results  some people fell onto their knees,btohqsg
bro... not just any bookout but early bookout,btohqsg
But got q alot of people ik perform worse cuz of varying factors (stress  incredibly hard papers  incredibly lax marking in their jc),btohqsg
damn you are 1 of the rare cases,btohqsg
Anyways I'm going back to ej to see what gappens,btohqsg

Go? Go where? I‚Äôm still under the boulder enjoying empirical evidence of Newton‚Äôs work,btohqsg
oh ok i guess i will try resend,btohqsg
but if the profile is there  it is not blocked right,btohqsg
But I could still see pfp,btohqsg
But I think that's a glitch,btohqsg
wah...but i dunno why would he block me,btohqsg
Or he hasn't opened his phone,btohqsg
but i also dunno if he block me  not possible to know,btohqsg
And he hasn't used the one u texted him on,btohqsg
I had a friend also who used to be perpetual single grey tick,btohqsg
u can try calling if u wan,btohqsg
And apparatly she just didn't use her phone for 3 days straight,btohqsg
I get a higher response rate from her through emails than whatsapp,btohqsg
if it doesn't go thru means u kena blocked,btohqsg
wah but like the message looks undelivered,btohqsg
first time it has happened  like when i was texting him during my intern,btohqsg
Nope. I am an old man who no longer needs to serve NS. I took PCMfM  and special paper (H3 for my generation of students) in C. In my head  I am still under the fM boulder,btohqsg
but i think it is too late to get the message deleted i think,btohqsg
but maybe i should just resend,btohqsg

n talk to my jc friends,btohqsg
n i scared to trll them thst im lgbt+,btohqsg
If they are your friends  they won‚Äôt care what you look like and what your sexuality is.,btohqsg
but beinf lgbt is a minority here,btohqsg
Like idk if it were me and they ask me for my opinion I'll just be,btohqsg
bc got 3 girls im my class and 2 girls in my og damn pretty,btohqsg
Then let them think abt it,btohqsg
1) during bmt  shag2) fam stuff,btohqsg
Ngl people who study for ur whole jc,btohqsg
bro not everyone is like you,btohqsg
But if u spend ur whole jc,btohqsg
Like wtf bruh abit wasted sia,btohqsg
wasted in a sense that they didn't figure out what works and what to prioritise I guess,btohqsg
U distill ur entire life into only studying,btohqsg
but you never know if they have other issues at the side lor,btohqsg
Then how do u have the time to study :/,btohqsg
you make sense most of the time but this one i have to take it with more than just a pinch of salt,btohqsg
Idk I was working while in jc,btohqsg
it's hard to say/know unless you know their 24h schedule mah,btohqsg
Yeah but I just feel like u wasted 2 years of ur life,btohqsg
i would say it is rather unfortunate more than waste,btohqsg
Idk people who think no 90rp is the end of rhe world,btohqsg
Okay ukw lemme rephrase u spend ur whole life in jc studying but don't do decently well for ur 4 content subjects,btohqsg
i would say it is not a waste because after JC  they should more or less know more about themselves  what works and what doesn't and also about what they truly like and prioritise so It's not really a waste if we look at the grand scheme of things  just unfortunate,btohqsg
Idh faith in schs to teach gp properly,btohqsg
I see what some schs teach I become confused,btohqsg
Idk why schs teach AQ ngl,btohqsg
Like or spend so much time on AQ,btohqsg
If u full mark ur SAQ,btohqsg
"are you going down the path ""med law dent cs or a disappointment to the family""",btohqsg
It‚Äôs sad that teachers of this calibre can still keep their jobs,btohqsg
it is so much easier to get full marks for SAQ than summary and AQ,btohqsg
Some senior teachers are legit quite useless,btohqsg
Highest I got for SAQ is,btohqsg

Everytime I go to the teacher to ask why my answer is wrong they just tell me,btohqsg

WATS THR TO LEARN FOR SAQ,btohqsg
They couldn't even explain why my answer was wrong,btohqsg
Cuz my writing is q big picture,btohqsg
Then saq is very small details,btohqsg
i dont care abt tcher name de,btohqsg
like how idk 90% of the ppl in my class names,btohqsg
Cuz SAQ is testing ur ability to analyze text at a local level,btohqsg
Summary is analysis of text at a global level,btohqsg
I'm damn bad at details stuff,btohqsg
