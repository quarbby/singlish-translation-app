funny how its u thats saying this,btohqsg
Oh..either way yea I guess it’s true then,btohqsg
Yea indeed it’s funny  but I’m working to improve it but it’s not easy when my poly got a bell curve,btohqsg
It helps me sometimes like when I get 7/24 for a quiz and get B,btohqsg
Other times I practically design a whole app with around 20+ artboard but get a D because my classmates all decided to do 100+ art boards,btohqsg
Nah it’s the reality of rp,btohqsg

the funny thing is i have friends with 100+ artboards and get the same grade as me,btohqsg
please do. abstinence for 2 weeks pls,btohqsg
i seek  your coorperation with the challenge 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏,btohqsg
i have 2 classmates that basically made 20 artboards..then replicated those 20 2 times and changed certain details..one got a D and the other got a B,btohqsg
In rp  these two are used to alter the grades according to the bell curve,btohqsg
if SDL drops to level 3  its a C..right now this grade gives a B,btohqsg
This goes to 3 its a A,btohqsg
i got a 2  so i got a B,btohqsg
yep  because you see if you get a level 3 its a Ayou get a level 4 its still a A,btohqsg
prob my poly..cause friends from other diploma's getting the same kind of grades thrown at them,btohqsg

"i asked the teacher  after..that is what he said ""If you do the bare minimum  you will get a D because its the minimum""Me:"" So if i replicate my artboards to produce more content  i should be getting higher than a D right?""Him: yea you should",btohqsg
