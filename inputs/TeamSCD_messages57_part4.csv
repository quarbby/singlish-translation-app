I kanna before  when you come back to the Malaysia custom just tell them you did pass the passport to the Malaysia custom but they didn‚Äôt chop.After which they will bring you into their office and just have to wait. No fine whatsoever.,btohqsg
Even if you go back their customs and tell them your process of entering msia  they will peng story say cctv spoil so your reason not valid,btohqsg
No chop serious enough to detain you for hours. That's true,btohqsg
Yeah .that why I said...must see luck liao,btohqsg
If they check and what you said is not true prepare for the worst lo,btohqsg
