Hi Peter You read it right. Interest rate will balloon. Rating for bond may downgrade. Bond price may fall.As rate increase  shift focus to equities especially emerging markets. Else  put in cpf guaranteed bond if age is near retirement.Lastly  remember how Hyflux and other perpetual busted.,btohqsg

Hi  can I ask does anyone know where to find investor?,btohqsg
If you are an insurance or financial advisor looking for investor  don’t think you will find clients here tbhMost of real investors will never touch any ILP funds.It’s usually feeder funds  with extra charges  hidden in fund fact sheets and limited amount of choices,btohqsg
As in invest into a start up,btohqsg
Yeah  first round always your own friends and familyThen once you have a MVP  easier to propose to angel investors and venture capitalist,btohqsg
But know where to find them?,btohqsg
Yea  but they don’t just open their door to anyone who has an idea. And different VC have different sectorsEasier to get a bank loan at first stage,btohqsg
Or at least u explain what’s your sector or startup,btohqsg
Post onbusinessforsale.sg  cant guarantee ppl will be interested but doesnt hurt to try.,btohqsg
We have a website.Our company called Sinma resources,btohqsg
Bro  so u are looking for investors and when I tried to probe for more details (instead of you proactively offer since it will help you)  you just gave a name and expect us to google for you out and find these details ourselves?Alright. Sure. All the best to your business,btohqsg

Try to share more details here. Easier for pple to pm u when u more open to share,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice. I truly appreciate it  It was my first here and didn't know the practice. 🙇,btohqsg
The other reason is that these are business projects. Hence  there are sensitive business confidential  pricing and personal information in nature to take into consideration for public posting of any of the details and documents.,btohqsg
So usually some information are shared privately after some discussions or meeting up face to face to view and see rather than to be sent and retained.,btohqsg
This is investment and property discussion chat…,btohqsg

Scammer deleted and banned.Btw that was the latest scam on retailers who just know how to use metamask wallet.They shared a private wallet with some valuable crypto inside (iirc usually tron chain). You thought oh well they give the keys so you want to extract the assets and sell it. You tried but there is insufficient gasSo you buy and transfer tron to it. The smart wallet has a bot that transfer any incoming tron out immediately.That’s how they scam,btohqsg
I see that you are in many SG groups common with me,btohqsg
Haha it’s cheap now  and unlike most crypto projectThis is real revenue generating,btohqsg
Looksrare but smallI’m mostly in gmx,btohqsg
Thanks. What’s the unique point that makes u buy KAE?,btohqsg
