Share or no share no difference also actually,btohqsg
$500 can't even buy a new air intake,btohqsg
Can send your car for spa,btohqsg
oh yes i can change tyres,btohqsg
your should be 600-700 min i think,btohqsg
i nvr said i was getting 500,btohqsg
as in i dont need fork out so much cash eitherways,btohqsg
Yes  I just bought 4 pcs hankook from carousell at 620nett.,btohqsg
Whats the typical mileage for tyres?,btohqsg
depends on a lot of factors,btohqsg
how often you maintain tyre pressures,btohqsg
what kind of tyres you're using  econo tyres or performance compounds etc ,btohqsg
every tyre type different in compound  tread and composition,btohqsg
Majority on Singapore road. Sometimes on malaysia roads. On Fuel-saving Eco tyres (not budget). Rarely goes off road,btohqsg
say you run a tyre with lower load index than recommended by manufacturer,btohqsg
the best way to measure tyre life is not to use KM,btohqsg
but tread wear indicator or tread depth gauge,btohqsg
what weight each tyre is rated to,btohqsg
Need to researh on how to see falken tyres. Bought in 2020,btohqsg
there will be a standard bar in the middle of the trad pattern,btohqsg
if your tread is close to or at the bar already you should consider changing,btohqsg
but not botak cannot do doughnuts,btohqsg
Its on my beetle la. Just dunno when should be a good time to change to a higher profile tyre,btohqsg
Usually new tyres are at 8 to 9mm tread depth and you can drive until they reach 1.6mm but it's recommended to change when they reach 3mm,btohqsg
why do you want to change to higher profile? any specific reason?,btohqsg
also if your tyres aren't too worn but you want to change  you can always do so by selling your used to tyres to the tyre shop,btohqsg
doesn't get you much but at least you don't throw them away,btohqsg
they're willing to pay as long as your tread higher than 50%,btohqsg
This one too much la. But will look nice on a safari,btohqsg
you'd have to significantly increase to feel a big difference,btohqsg
Current tyres are slightly smaller compared to stock,btohqsg
as you can see not too much of a difference,btohqsg
If profile is not shown it is noted to be default 80,btohqsg
So far I am looking at Van's 195R15C  cos that is 195/80R15,btohqsg
the wider cross section definitely helps,btohqsg
Looking at 165/80R15 front and 195/80R15 rear. So it won't look too off balancce.,btohqsg
15inch dont have 70 or 75 Profile  sadly,btohqsg
195R15C are essential Toyota HiAce Tyres,btohqsg
Yes  I think for a high sidewall like that you'd have to go commercial sizing,btohqsg
Load index with commercial tyres should not be an issue as they usually have a higher one,btohqsg
and i'm sure your beetle isn't going too fast anywhere so speed rating being decent enough should be fine,btohqsg
check for brands that are tested and have safety ratings though,btohqsg
i.e. don't get tourador or rydanz,btohqsg
Those pasted tourador stickers be trippin bro,btohqsg
I would put all 3 brands together,btohqsg
How bro your rydanz kena diss,btohqsg
btw is there a website that listed all the test done by EU? I think at least that is a benchmark I can rely on.They measure fuel economy and wet braking,btohqsg
Do I still need VEP to enter Malaysia?,btohqsg
no  but need pay 20RM for the VEP by TnG,btohqsg
At the custom thatâ€™s all right?,btohqsg
