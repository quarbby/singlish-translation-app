If he saw sure can stopLikely thought is a cupboard box or what,btohqsg
you see you will slow down meh,btohqsg
because this whole incident thing could have been avoided only if the owners themselves closed the windows,btohqsg
I can't even notice the hazard light.,btohqsg
The owner know and is chasing the dog,btohqsg
The owner is to blame.  End of the story.,btohqsg
U don't like that... Later her sob story don't work,btohqsg
Let her sob. Serve her right.ü§£,btohqsg
Not fit to be dog owner.,btohqsg
She shld have said Johnny Depp beat her...,btohqsg
I sometimes even see dog owner carrying the dog while driving. These people don't fit to be dogs owner.,btohqsg
Well they themselves should know as pet owners that dogs and cats have the tendency of jumping out of the car out of naughtiness,btohqsg
The car is not even speeding.üòÇ,btohqsg
well if the windows aren‚Äôt up then it‚Äôs ok,btohqsg
The owner could just be grieving for the death of her dog and write in such a spiteful way,btohqsg
heng not motorbike.. later DPS skid over and crash how?,btohqsg
that‚Äôs true but still  I wouldn‚Äôt fully blame the car that ran over the dog,btohqsg
Very hard to blame the driver,btohqsg
That road is slightly curved. So as u drive and come up to the top of the ‚Äúcurve‚Äù very hard to spot something as short as a dog,btohqsg
next time own a dog need license  only responsible people can own dogs,btohqsg
And u sure pick up speed because u need more rev to go up the curve,btohqsg
No one will purposely run a dog over in that situation. Why the dog running loose in the first place,btohqsg
As u approach the peak as the road going downhill,btohqsg
just read this....obviously this person trying stir shit,btohqsg
are you saying the car sped up?,btohqsg
In theory but nobody drives like this,btohqsg
are you saying if he's driving a subaru XV he definitey would have seen the dog?,btohqsg
Because nobody expects a fucking animal to appear in the middle of the road,btohqsg
do you know whats the teaching for what to do when an animal appear in front of your car out of no where?,btohqsg
U tell me u drive who when reach the end of the trajectory of a winding road will slow down? Nobody,btohqsg
Coffee. Because in a bad boy,btohqsg
and you know how the subaru xv hit the dog? you know how it sound like to the subaru driver?,btohqsg
just no swerving no e brake,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why more probablyDidn‚Äôt see dogDidn‚Äôt know bang dog,btohqsg
subaru xv tall. sure can see. not i say one,btohqsg
Tbh. Bartley there that junction alot stray furs.,btohqsg
Midnight u see alot gathering in the middle of the road,btohqsg
wahhh how you see its fur,btohqsg
Fur refer cats and dogs. Haha,btohqsg
How to define if driver knowing that they had hit on them ?,btohqsg
If I'm driving a truck  and just nice. I drove past and they appear just my front wheel hit on them ?,btohqsg
ya.. just say deny can liao,btohqsg
That road too dangerous to stop also,btohqsg
Unless the driver also has a death wish,btohqsg
Yah lo. During the daylight  all heavy vehicles transporting sands and materials past there,btohqsg
True la. This incident is the driver at fault  I would said. But if he/ she really no see. Then where would the eye on ? Phone ? .,btohqsg
dont like that... later she no one to blame liao  she wld blame LTA for building that road,btohqsg
Haha. Yah... commuters shld read and warn self person to be more cautions on road and not to comment so much .. machiam is involved.,btohqsg
Yah. Not that the fur kids know how to behave itself by sitting guai guai in the car.,btohqsg
Car 1 stops.  Dog turns to go on the other lane.Then car 2 driving  an animal appears from a blind spot infront of car 1,btohqsg
