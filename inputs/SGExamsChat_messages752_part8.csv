Usually for large fires it may require mutiple engines from different stations so there is a need to have 1 guy make the decisions,btohqsg
But that decision maker has to decide how to fight the fire,btohqsg
If there's factors like ppl inside or idk industrial material like gasoline which err is not kind to fires,btohqsg
They would be a need for a offensive approach,btohqsg
I think SCDFs workhorse is the pump ladder for fire engines,btohqsg
U gotta establish water access as well from hydrants the 2.4k Liters of water will be gone in minutes at full flow,btohqsg
That's the tank of the engine..,btohqsg
No hydrants have a flow rate to replenish the tank,btohqsg
Bro the amount of water needed to fight fires is like... a lot,btohqsg

In a full building fire? That will be gone in 5 mins,btohqsg
Bro this is also why if u fucked with properly made sprinklers u don't have to worry about fire.. but u might have to worry about drowning.,btohqsg
Ok.. some old buildings build before fire codes are let's just say not up to standard so for those instances legit to make up for it they install sprinklers with a very high flow rate,btohqsg
Cuz ideally the sprinklers are a additional line of defense oni,btohqsg
The main goal is to contain the fire. Either to a room or to a floor and not the let it spread,btohqsg
Ventilation ducts and windows must adhere to building codes so for those that funnel into wall space it must maintain the same level of fire resistance than just the wall itself,btohqsg
Also it helps that our buildings are all made of solid steel reinforced rebar concrete,btohqsg
Just for penetrations alone the code takes up like 70 pages,btohqsg
Hey it is this code that makes it so and why that everytime you see a HDB fire it is almost always confined to the unit alone,btohqsg
If u think about it its kinda astonishing that we are able to compartmentalise and contain fires,btohqsg
Yeah bruh our fire suppression and fighting is so good now I think the advise when a fire is ongoing in your building is to just stay in your unitðŸ’€,btohqsg
U panic all rush down will choke and open doors allowing for the fire to spread.,btohqsg
Siao no la only those in imminent danger,btohqsg
Ya la the most same floor leave and that's about it,btohqsg
I think since SG got like damn high rise buildings there is also something called Refuge floors whereby got extra concrete build between the levels to further prevent spread,btohqsg
Fk we haven't learnt warehouse fire yet,btohqsg
Optimal flow rate is 34 litres per sec,btohqsg
Theyâ€™re still legal tender tho so matcha can give all 1 cents and that notes girl canâ€™t say she wasnâ€™t paid lol,btohqsg
I have a few 1 cent coins at home,btohqsg
Unfortunately I only have less than 5,btohqsg
The cost of sending matcha those coins would be more than the value of the coins :(,btohqsg
Might as well pay in a different currency,btohqsg
How sia isnt that phased out p long ago,btohqsg
Yeah but I somehow have some lying around,btohqsg
Is my bp that low sia  idk why when i wear mask and walk  i will get giddy / headache,btohqsg
Meanwhile I have the exact opposite problem,btohqsg
Meanwhile i hate coinsâ€¦so sometimes i will end up getting coins as change coz i lazy find my coins to give the store,btohqsg
maybe cuz u cant breathe properly?,btohqsg
And aso in the airport t1 the waiting area is damn narrow  i will get giddy,btohqsg
Can just put your small change into a vending machine when you get a lot,btohqsg
Most of them will not refund the same coins you put in but in larger denominations,btohqsg
The freaking train is damn crowded,btohqsg
My mum be like â€˜then dun wear maskâ€™,btohqsg
Yeah but at least since most stalls will just round up to nearest 10 cents I barely have to deal with those,btohqsg
I think it has something to do w blood circulation (same as the pins n needles shit),btohqsg
Like mask is just an obstacle there,btohqsg
Yesterday i got giddy when i entered the train,btohqsg
I also think now I keep getting urti/flu symptoms is because of those stupid ppl who are sick but donâ€™t wear masks on public transport,btohqsg
I think if i no seats i would hv fainted,btohqsg
I see ppl coughing but dun wear mask also,btohqsg
