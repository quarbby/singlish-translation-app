They will probably be happy because you're giving them free tax relief.. and you'll be happy to be able to continue to pay your premiums.. The only cost is you'll be locking up cash into MA  which you could possibly put into T-bills for some safe interest. Really depends on what you want and if your children is ok to help you.,btohqsg
Power... amazing. Like that also can,btohqsg
sounds interesting  will check that strat out haha thanks!,btohqsg
max $1k reward cap though  on 2.5k spend it's equal to general cashback card,btohqsg
If u clock on lady u can fulfill spend criteria for uob one bonus interest if u have full 100k in it for apr or 150k in may,btohqsg
Just try. If don't approve then wait for your income to update to latest NOA and apply again.,btohqsg
Is there any t&c for 10% on simplygo txns?,btohqsg
You can read UOB One card's tnc for the whole card itself,btohqsg
that is part of the journeyneed effort to play miles and cashback game effectively.,btohqsg
Yea I agree. Human get more satisfactory only after some hardwork and everyone spending is different not easy 1 way fit all,btohqsg
Quarterly fee  2.18 per counter if not mistaken,btohqsg
You gotta work for it. Sometimes you'll realise you'll only use the card for a year and then you'll need to change the entire strategy with multiple different cards.,btohqsg
Hello. Wanted to solicit some advice. I'm going to be living in UK for a year. Does it make sense to (1) apply for a UK credit card (likely cashback since I likely can't clock enough miles meaningfully in a year) or (2) spend on a Singapore credit card (likely using instarem amaze)?,btohqsg
If keep cancelling and changing the cards  is there any impact to credit rating?,btohqsg
Don't cancel.. just use a different card?,btohqsg

Question on VCMAI cannot topup MA and I only have the choice to topup SA  is it due to my MA haven‚Äôt reached to MIN MA amount? Thanks,btohqsg
What is moo moo new user reward ?,btohqsg
Hazelthey have different tiers of rewards..,btohqsg
Wah 900sgd interest? Interest guarantee but principal not guarantee lol that line very interesting because they don't have fixed deposit as base case I guess,btohqsg
Did you go to the correct place? VCMA is via e-Cashier  make sure you select the correct employment status. There's no minimum MA lol.,btohqsg
1. Who owns them?2. Mas regulated?3. How long in business?,btohqsg
How did you derive the $186 return for the 20 days $10k?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm assuming your cash isn‚Äôt earning much. VCMA you‚Äôll earn 4% on MA  not bad considering there‚Äôs utility for MA eventually. With your MA being low now  I‚Äôm assuming there‚Äôs been large usage before.For tax relief  that‚Äôs a bonus‚Ä¶ either gift them or split the tax savings with them?,btohqsg
Does retiree can qualify for credit cards? Even small credit limit? Thanks,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check whether instarem amaze is considered a prepaid account or payment services provider?,btohqsg
No news yet  probably later this month.,btohqsg
My view is they will give debit credit card only. That is what UOB give to my mother.,btohqsg
think better that u give the context of your question,btohqsg
For retirees (aged 55 and above) with no income  they have 3 options  (1) secured CCs by having FD as collateral  (2) have a total of net personal assets exceeding 750k  (3) guarantor with a minimum income of 30k.Credit limits for (1) will be based on FD  (2) will be tiered based net personal assets (750k/2m)  (3) income of guarantor.For retirees (below age 55) with no income  they can also have (1) as an option. Additionally  net personal assets above 2m or net financial assets above 1m.,btohqsg
If I use Mastercard to link up with amaze card and pay a bill does it consider as payment services provider or prepaid account?,btohqsg
UserGerdonhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no shopper links,btohqsg
It counts as an online transaction of paying the bill  depending what bill it is  starting with AMAZE.,btohqsg
