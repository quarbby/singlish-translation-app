Not so soon ba.. But there will be update.. Malaysia still mco,btohqsg
After avarga need to shout JT liao,btohqsg
That paper listing nothing much one ba,btohqsg
Jiutian didn't moved up nor down for the past few session. If don't want to drop  it will mean the chance of moving up is higher. Friday hit the MA support & rebounded. Friday is T+4. So T+4 over now. Tomorrow may have chance already. If price come to 100-111  I believe many retailers don't dare to touch becuse past few sessions hit there n retrace. So if price can clear 112  high chance it's real one. If you have guts  107 serve  as a safe entry since price didn't close below 107 for past few sessions n you have a strong MA support at 105.,btohqsg

Good morning Hustlepeople !QOTD“The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.”- Mahatma GandhiStill hoping for strong results for Medtecs to lead overall sentiments.Also  put the politics aside. It’s not going to get us anywhere to indulge in that.Let’s go and blessed week ahead.PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.,btohqsg
