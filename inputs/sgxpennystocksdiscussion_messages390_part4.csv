I find Tiger asks a lot of information  some of which don‚Äôt seem necessary. To withdraw without DDA  must fill in a lot of details.,btohqsg
I am trying out US and HK on tiger and moo moo. On the whole  prefer tiger's interface.,btohqsg
Saw some feedback that trading in pre-market with Moomoo is better than Tiger (unable to sell).,btohqsg
