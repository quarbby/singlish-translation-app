They spent 15 mins asking my mom to sign her signature to use internet banking.. Cuz her signature is not the same as the one she signed 10 YEARS AGO. She doesn't sign the signature exactly the same anymore.. If she used the 10 years ago signature  then all her current cheques will bounce right? I don't understand them.. Just update signature can liao what.,btohqsg
Its like that lah  cdp said my signature wrong  i had to go al the way down to buona vista and sign in front of them,btohqsg
Hi guys  does anyone know of any credit cards that are good for overseas spending? Or are debit cards the best (youtrip),btohqsg
Hello all! Citi miles card is the best card for airflight? Anyone has other recommendations,btohqsg
Ask an ignorant question. Just to confirm. When my friend or someone in my family paynow me $1600  would the transaction be reflected as 'PAYNOW SALA' if the purpose is put as salary?,btohqsg
Anyone sign up for the bonus interest promotion by HSBC,btohqsg
Do anyone know if the bonus interest on everyday account means u need top up monthly to get bonus interest ?,btohqsg
there will be a reference month,btohqsg
depends what platform u use and what settings u do...  i think got some examples above.. just follow them EXACTLY,btohqsg

The reference month keep on moving one rightMay2023  reference month is April 2023June2023 reference month is May 2023July 2023 reference month is June 2023Is it right?,btohqsg
reference month for 4.x% does not move when u sms inreference month for 1% is always the previous month,btohqsg
Do i need to top up during the promotion monthsAs it state this promotion will be paid bonus interest on the top up amount for the calendar monyhs May 2023 June 2023  July 2023  august 2023,btohqsg
no need topup if after the 4.x% only1% you need 2 accounts to rotate,btohqsg
And you only know whether you did it right 6 months later üòÖ,btohqsg
very long later la... haha... just use excel to keep track,btohqsg
1 percent how to do it,btohqsg
rotate between 2 accounts... search earlier msgs.. mentioned b4,btohqsg
What is 5 transfer out ? Stated?,btohqsg
transfer to your other account $10 five times.,btohqsg
Then what is put in all in march and may ?,btohqsg
I think this is where you review Chris ‚Äòs YouTubes and read the T snd Cs to avoid misinterpreting things üëçüèª,btohqsg
yes i agree... it is best to watch the official video and read the official TNC..The worst that can happen is you read piece meal msgs and end up do wrongly.. lose the benefits and rage..,btohqsg
Chris video is very good but the content is based on point in time info. Fully agree  it is our responsibility to read the TnC to confirm üòä,btohqsg
"Hi Folks  quick question on Credit Card Statement cut off dates  which is the ""correct"" date for the statement to be generated to be on par with the calendar month? 31st or 1st day?",btohqsg
ok  perfect  just what I thought so  thank you!,btohqsg
Hi bosses.1) Any particular card strategy good for short burst of increase in spending (i.e. Reno + buy furnitures/appliances)2) any card that offer interest free and without processing/admin fee to split my huge spending to monthly installment?,btohqsg
From my tests so far  you have to apply for the NEXT tbill after the maturing tbill.The credit of the maturing Tbill will not make it in time for the deduction of the new Tbill that is Issued on the same day as your Maturity.So basically if your Tbill matures today 16th May 2023  you can only use the maturity proceeds to apply for the End May 2023 one.For this case  for good practice (actually I think it won't make a difference)  you should manually transfer the maturity proceeds from your CPF IA back to CPF OA once you see the maturity proceeds in your CPF IA (just in case you don't get full allocation).,btohqsg
Those mile chasers here  if you are using UOB One account to maximise interest and cashback  what kind of spend categories do you park under UOB One/Evol to meet the minimum spend criteria,btohqsg
My post is just an example for those with March-June cycle   you need to find out your own cycle and replace accordingly,btohqsg
Hi all may i check with the experts here  the most recent T-bill is issued on 16th May (today) right? How come i still dont see it in my cdp account?,btohqsg
Want to understand put in all means what?Why need to do 2 times,btohqsg
All means all you have  if u have another high saving account  you can do merry go round trick with EGA+1 high saving accounts because of the additional 1% for everyday reward promo,btohqsg
What I would add as comment is it is very difficult for anyone to completely give you the full steps to perform the tasks. It is only advice on a best effort basis.Strongly recommend you read the TNC document 5 times so you are familiar  to avoid disappointment after 6 months.,btohqsg
This is not being sarcastic or unhelpful to be honest. This is what I believe most of us HSBC EGA players had to do ourselves in order to fully understand how it works (for our individual situation).,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is one of the most complicated savings accounts out there now (as with UOB One credit card being one of the most complicated credit cards out there).But both are among the most rewarding savings and credit cards out there.,btohqsg
I called hsbc twice to enquire. Both gave me two different answer,btohqsg
Anyone paying sp services/starhub/singtel by recurring payment with UOB One card. Qualify to meet the 500min spend for UOB One account?,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the query ? If we can answer we will answer..,btohqsg
The promotion for bonus interest lo,btohqsg
U will be surprised.. it is rather complicated until HSBC staff themselves are not trained properly.,btohqsg
at first yes chim  but u read the TnC everyday for 1 month you will also be pro like the korkors above too,btohqsg
I've decided to go to bank open acct + ask on the spot. Bcoz I think the person whom I spoke to  made me even more confusing...,btohqsg
I give up hsbc...gg to open ocbc div+  instead,btohqsg
Can I use instarem amaze pair with HSBC revolutions for booking airtickets in foreign currency? My total spend would be around 3 to 4 k in sgd. Is that the best combo if I have EGA. I don't have the UOB women's card,btohqsg
cannot. instarem amaze can only pair mastercards,btohqsg
