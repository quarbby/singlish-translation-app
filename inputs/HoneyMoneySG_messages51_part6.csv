Hello  can I check if purchase at audio house via OCBC Titanium earns your 4mpd?,btohqsg
you can consider GXS too. can park $5K inside.,btohqsg
Is singlife a good place to park money?,btohqsg
2% for first 10k  not too bad i guess,btohqsg
If you can park it in OCBC 360 and with increase ADB $500 per month  you easily get 3.2%.HSBC EGA can get 3.85-4.85% per month. But not too sure they allow you to open or not.,btohqsg
I‚Äôve hsbc revo and I was reading about the hsbc ega. But it‚Äôs quite confusing. I just want to park maybe 1k a month over there?,btohqsg
Minimum is $2k per month or kena fall below fee.,btohqsg
Ohh then do I have to park the 2k there? Or once I Deposit i can immediately remove it?,btohqsg
It is ADB. I believe if the amount is too small  POSB saving is sufficient for you  because the interest difference maybe less than $5 per month. You won‚Äôt need to worry this $5 n transfer your money here n there every month. Spend your precious time on how to increase your income is more worth n important..,btohqsg
if amount is small suggest to keep it simple and use GXS,btohqsg
the effort needed to unlock the additional tiers might not be not worth the returns. your time and effort can be better spent elsewhere to increase your base,btohqsg
does anyone know if i can use my kris miles that‚Äôs expiring in July to book a trip now  with travel date in August?,btohqsg

Just have to wait. They're quite slow unfortunately,btohqsg
