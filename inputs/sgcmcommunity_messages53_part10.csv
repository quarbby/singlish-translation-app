While they use public transport for work,btohqsg
Yup there are actually quite a number of them. Dont have to be uber rich  just have enough passion to splash the cash,btohqsg
Mostly alfas and mercedes i would think,btohqsg
A good mix from what I've seen,btohqsg
Im not a classics guy  so i dont know the other brands haha,btohqsg
Time to go look at the new category coming on sgcm!!,btohqsg
old bmws are actually one of the least renewed cars or classic cars here,btohqsg
Cant understand why people prefer merc,btohqsg
There's a lot coming in now as imports,btohqsg
Reliability is one of the top criteria i believe. But i find bmws more appealing. Sorry bmw fan here haha,btohqsg
I think a lot of mercs around because it is easier worldwide to find parts for them because a lot of countries still have old mercs running,btohqsg
"And they were more famous in their respective eras as well as ""boss cars""",btohqsg
I think there is a pretty old b5 or b7 here,btohqsg
If can import as normal scheme better,btohqsg
Instead of the stupid 45 days,btohqsg
Actually i dont know how they get around that,btohqsg
I thought importing a used car cannot be more than 3 yrs old,btohqsg
But anyway  not like i will import one anytime soon. I'd rather catch some sleep now,btohqsg
Good talk! See u at sgcm office tomorrow hahaha,btohqsg
And dream of the winning number for tmr so you can import one alpina b3/5 in,btohqsg
Cant win if you dont buy,btohqsg
