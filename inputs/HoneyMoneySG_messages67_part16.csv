Now I am worried about how to place my competitive bids for next auction. I am very new to t bills bidding only started less than 3 months ago. Learnt everything from YouTube videos üòÇ grateful for any advice thanks in advance,btohqsg
I cannot log in on the app,btohqsg
SPP no shares no paid up capital one,btohqsg
Hey Bro  if I die die need paid up capital  can I show my bank account balance or is there a way to do it? Any way around this?,btohqsg
If you need paid up capital in your BP to reflect  only local company can have this,btohqsg
I must say UOB is a pain in the ass experience for their credit card application process and credit limit process. I‚Äôm leaving it and sticking to DBS,btohqsg
Why you don‚Äôt want local company ? Local company is safer even though more costly  SPP is cheaper but riskier,btohqsg
Why ? Perhaps you did not meet their minimum requirements?So far all my applications for UOB products were approved within 1 minute  the slowest is 6 minutes.,btohqsg
anyone have experience appealing account closure?,btohqsg
tried to open uob bank one acc. the staff says system reject ask me go try other bank,btohqsg
If promo period need to wait  otherwise fast,btohqsg
takes awhile haha got rejected alot of times until successful,btohqsg
Hi all  are we able to see how much was spent for online spend and mobile contactless spend for UOB evol card?,btohqsg
Hi experts  I tried applying for the uob lady's solitare card and gt rejected due to income. May I ask what is the next best card to pay for wedding hotel venues to accum miles? WouldDBS Woman‚Äôs World Cardbe a good option for its online spend capped at 2k/mth?,btohqsg
Account closure or cannot open new account?,btohqsg
Last time got uob savings  uob suddenly send letter saying will close on 30 days without any reason. Now I graduated Liao wanna open uob 1 for to credit salary but uob staff say cannot open,btohqsg
Why not apply lady's card instead,btohqsg
Oh did U do naughty things like game their rewards? If kenna account closure from a bank is lifetime ban.,btohqsg
Make me wait 3-4 hours in bank branch for nothing,btohqsg
Capped at 1k per mth. I'm looking for around 2k to 3k per mth. Trying to reduce the number of cards I apply,btohqsg
I got ban doing naughty things with revolut üòÖ,btohqsg
Yeah lifetime ban from revolut for u then.,btohqsg
Wah cannot appeal meh. Never do anything wrong wor. No debt etc.I ask the staff they ask me call hotline. I called hotline they ask me go down bank branch ü•πü•π I dw waste time haiz,btohqsg
Try to appeal first? If not then fianc√© and you both apply ladies card,btohqsg
Only u know what u did. We won‚Äôt know la.But can only say bank won‚Äôt close u for no reason one la. U must have done something against their terms and conditions.,btohqsg
Yes. But okay lah got trust card and you trip to replace revolut. Last time can get miles from them now cannot,btohqsg
Yup. Uob ban u. Still got dbs and ocbc.Just don‚Äôt repeat your Naughty behaviour until left no bank.,btohqsg
Fiance got uob lady solitare card already. So would dbs womens world card be a food alternative?,btohqsg
Yes. Shd be able to generate online links for me to make payment online,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúWedding card‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Yes I guess that's the next best alternative. Still I will probably do lady's card and DBS woman's if you already collecting miles using UOB. UOB pools the miles anyways,btohqsg
I love how you end your replies ü§£,btohqsg
Did you let other people used your bank account before?,btohqsg
No last time kena was scammed by a scammer on carousell. The police report froze the account for few months before closing it.That time thought nothing much of it uh. How I know will end up blocked from opening a new account,btohqsg
How the scammer Scammed your account? Your released your OTP to them? Download illegal apps?,btohqsg
I was selling things on carousell online. Scammer get people to xfer money to my paynow and use their screenshot to make payment and posed as a customer.,btohqsg
Scammer got away with the item without paying using other people funds,btohqsg
Now I trying to write to MAS to appeal. Saw online someone managed to appeal but I don't know the right channel. Hope someone with such experience can share info,btohqsg
Mean other people paid to you but did not received the items.You send the items to scammer.You need to return the money to other people?,btohqsg
Never return  the person report police case on my bank account that's why frozen üòÆ‚Äçüí®Both side kena scammed,btohqsg
