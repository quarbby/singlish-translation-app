YouTrip is a prepaid wallet mah. U need to top up before your trip. U top up is in Sgd de,btohqsg
What if I have bal in sgd jpy and usd? That is what I am referring to. Lol,btohqsg
U can change the currency in-app,btohqsg
Few years back then no lock down on geo location when performing transaction. Not sure if Youtrip has changed it due to whatever MAS restriction caused by the ocbc saga   that topup can only happen on SGP? Just a noob question.,btohqsg
I know can change in appâ€¦ my qns if i have 3 currency in my wallet and I spend in thb  it will deduct from which currency first? Naturally should be sgd.. just making sure it is SGD,btohqsg
Amaze+Citibank cashback can? If donâ€™t have Citibank rewards.. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Yeah this is a worry for me also. Ie if I canâ€™t top up YouTrip via Paynow when Iâ€™m in a foreign country coz the bank thinks itâ€™s fraudulent transaction.Prior to the trip  u can add a credit card as a backup to YouTrip. I wonâ€™t get reward points coz credit cards donâ€™t count top ups as eligible spend but it a backup for it Paynow top up fails.I usually call the bank before the trip to tell them iâ€™m going overseas and which card Iâ€™ll be using so that they donâ€™t Geo lock that.,btohqsg
