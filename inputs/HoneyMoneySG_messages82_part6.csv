If you want miles can consider citi rewards + Amaze,btohqsg
This is my current 2024 card strategy  for referencehttps://youtu.be/T0dtcQXhDXs?si=90asotPB3LQfrPHa,btohqsg
If you spend mostly in person vs online  UOB PPV is a great 4mpd ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù card. If you spend consistently over 1k per month  then UOB VSOr get both  then use whichever card is more appropriate depending on your forecasted spending pattern for that month,btohqsg
Hi all  regarding miles transfer fee  is it charged per credit card?For example  i have 2 credit cards from the same bank. So i have to pay the miles transfer fee twice?,btohqsg
some cards have pooling some dont have  so need to read the T&C,btohqsg
Does UOB lady's card and PPV have pooling?,btohqsg
uob uni$ pool and dbs rewards points pool,btohqsg
Existing account holders only $240 if invest 4K. üòû,btohqsg
i think existing account holder..if invested $4k on 1st Jan (and activate old and new challenges) can get $400 + $240,btohqsg
Is it recommended to use UOB miles card (since there is pooling) or use CR + amaze?,btohqsg
My main is UOB Evol  then the other spendings i used on CR as of now,btohqsg
Oh means I missed the 1 Jan promo. üò≠,btohqsg
Yes provided MCC tallies  will suggest using Ladies with Amaze for better FX,btohqsg
Actually this monthly promo around for the longest time. Just didn't do it until all the recent recommendation in the various channel. ü§∑,btohqsg
I think I miss this snack income stuff  can any kind soul tell me what do I need to do to earn?,btohqsg
I transfer employer. How long should I wait before I apply new credit card to increase chance of approval?,btohqsg
Did syfe revise their 3 month 4% guaranteed rate? Can't seem to find it anymore,btohqsg
Seems like it. Same for Stashaway too.,btohqsg
Ya seeing the same thing now... Dropped to 3.7%,btohqsg
O well  was good while it lasted,btohqsg
Stashaway is 3.8% for 3 months,btohqsg
the 4% was a promo until Dec 30  2023 only,btohqsg
omg... yesterday still remain 4%... so fast change to 3.7,btohqsg
maybe coz it was still holiday yesterday  they haven't updated it. But i remember seeing on their website saying Dec 30 as last day for the 4% promo,btohqsg
hhmm does this mean the local banks will start to decrease their deposit interest rates too?,btohqsg
i think they still give the 4% from my end...,btohqsg
This is just another indication that interest rates as a whole are going down after the fed indicated softening of their stance recently  but of course need to be careful when making plans assuming actual rate cuts  which haven‚Äôt actually happened yet.But it cuts both ways too - lower FD rates but also lower mortgage/personal loan rates,btohqsg
I see. Any tips on where to park the money for around 2-3 years to lock in the interest rate ?,btohqsg
Theres plenty of options to park for 2-3 years  but what you gain in assurance you trade off in interest rate. Or you can get more flexibility  but also trade off interest rate,btohqsg
20% is just a rough estimate. (a) shows Jan top-ups while (b) shows Dec top-ups. End of the day calculated is 19.1% difference after 10 years.,btohqsg
Total interest for (a) is $2472.63 and (b) is $2000.35.,btohqsg
https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/18ucr9t/uob_one_bonus_interest_take_note_of_credit_card/PSA - If you get a refund on UOB One Account linked CC... your spend requirement also go up lol,btohqsg
Hahaha thought was explicitly stated in tnc that refunds will minus from spending... But going negative is insane,btohqsg
yeah thats where im kinda mindblown too cause tracker wont indicate negative value,btohqsg
Although to be fair  at least UOB isn‚Äôt clawing back the past interest if there‚Äôs a refund  this only affects the current month. And as pointed out in the comments if they didn‚Äôt deduct from the spend goal it would be a pretty big loophole.Agree that the tracker should have reflected though,btohqsg
Tks to all who replied to my uob one account and the delay in sending my debit card. I have called and verified at branch. Indeed that a card  e.g. debit card if first time opening a uob one account is needed to login to the app. If u already have a uob account and has an existing debit card  it will linked to the existing debit card after u opened a uob account. Hence no new debit card will be sent to u.,btohqsg
Any platforms you would suggest to park for 2-3 years?,btohqsg
Hi  is it possible to get the UOB Lady‚Äôs Solitaire card without hitting income requirements?,btohqsg
Yes  can apply for lady‚Äôs then upgrade,btohqsg
Does it have a certain time buffer require? Or can after one month try to upgrade?,btohqsg
Did you managed to catch the Stashaway 4% 3M deal when i shared with you?,btohqsg
I know some people tried a few days after they got their normal lady‚Äôs.,btohqsg
Today morning I see still 4%. Haha.,btohqsg
Will delete all irrelevant links posted without explanation,btohqsg
It happen to me for dec as well  i use uob chat and cso advice to spend 500 plus 500 (total 1k) for jan to appeal in feb for dec bonus interest,btohqsg
I've gotten the Salary Credit and Card Spend bonus interest but not the Bill Payment category. I assumed it was just fast transfer out and I did that more than 3 times in Dec.  Did i missed out something or I can't do fast transfer?,btohqsg
Hi  I want to open a joint account with my wife. I alr have a uob one acc but my wife doesnt. Can we open a joint uob one acc with her being the primary holder and still able to enjoy EIR 5%?,btohqsg
Yes if fulfill 100k plus credit card spending on eligible card with her as principle card holder for the credit card,btohqsg
My wife is not working. Can i credit $1.6k monthly using the SALA method and spend $500 using the debit card  still able to benefit from EIR 5%?,btohqsg
A quick Google search got me this. Check if your bill payments are via GIRO or their online banking platform (not funds transfer).,btohqsg
