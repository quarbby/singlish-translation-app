Oh JT announcement still not out yet?,btohqsg
The thing is people keep saying there is news  but when asked them what news  no one can give an answer..,btohqsg
i am quietly confident about the news  at worst neutral news,btohqsg
At least something to look forward during the weekend   other than epl,btohqsg
like what I said in earlier posts  I v scared of China company halted.. so far  most of cases are bad news.. latest being SunMoon.. if no announcement now  login mon morning to check again.. if monday morning still no news  then potentially will be bad news..,btohqsg

He just invested? Maybe his ep was below $1,btohqsg
but based on current share price and the 1.98% of NAV  only works out to be around 780lots,btohqsg
Omg!! Never thought of this angle!,btohqsg
Ok maybe also  if based on current valued 1.98% @ $1.04mil and 1 170 000 shares  his EP is $0.88,btohqsg
Your üò≠has turn into üòÉ.U hit the jackpot. üëç,btohqsg
Report dated 13Oct. If have holding power  grab ThaiBev early & hold 3-5mths. $0.9 seems too high but $0.72 is a good possibility before Mar21. Based on the ‚Äúunbelievable‚Äù closing last evening  Monday gap up looks certain. Monitor to believe. üôÇ,btohqsg
Hope JT over the weekend have some news out,btohqsg
Thanks bro! Also looking to scoop some,btohqsg
Believe it is super good news so dont be anxious üòáüôèüôèüôè,btohqsg

Good morning Hustlepeople!Weekend Reflection Quotes  :1) We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of regret.- Jim Rohn2) We don‚Äôt have to be smarter than the rest. We have to be more disciplined than the rest-W.BHave a blessed Weekend with the Family! Next week should be a good week to trade.Enjoy üëç,btohqsg
üòÅ. We can take note of one impt factor on ThaiBev. This stocks very few players will contra cos the price fluctuation usually quite slow & minimum.Based on the past few days  BBs have tested the market & realized it‚Äôs difficult to force much investors to sell at below $0.58. (Those that did sold off due to panic already gone from the picture). Yesterday time & sales records more or less indicated it‚Äôs mostly BBs themselves selling & buying back between 0.565/0.57 to accumulate as much as possible. But right before closing  they scooped back all 0.57/0.575 to bring up the price back to 0.58.Monday or coming week  the price will continue to up. If it does drops after u get some  just hold on to the stocks. Good results awaits in the near future.,btohqsg
Thanks! I was waiting to scoop even lower actually until it went back up before closing.,btohqsg
For long.. good hedge against medical too..I think there's some ipo potential too for one of their division?,btohqsg
That I do not know. üòÅ,btohqsg
I just googled to check. .yeah there was plan to spin off beer division n ipo in sgx..but seems covid delayed the plans...so let's see...when and where n how...,btohqsg
Paiseh.Photo taken last Dec at HCM city  at one of the buffet.Love it.,btohqsg
Steady ! Kudos to the one who sent this email! heroic act! Not just talk the talk but walk the walk! Aunty clap clap üëè üëèThough the reply was a general PR response! I believe in everything  there is Full Blown Justice in the matter of Time!If they are good reasons to support your belief and determination  act it out! Otherwise take it as a lesson and move on ;) have a blessed weekend everyone.,btohqsg
If only the number 1.98 is the price that they are holding lol üòÇ,btohqsg
Can medtecs go up to 1.98?,btohqsg
Why not?! There is always possibilities ! In this case 1.98 is % ... anyway good to know this stock is vested by bb,btohqsg
From ytd's action  not impossible üí™,btohqsg
They buy all the good potential stock,btohqsg
Interesting to know they buy into which exchange!,btohqsg
Actually medtecs is making good profit but shares price is much lower than UG healthcare  before UG spilt it shares to 1 for 3.Also there is no any analysis report for TP for medtecs whereas UG healthcare had serveral analysis TP for it.Make no sense,btohqsg
Can I ask If a company transfer all it shares to another of their subsidiary  does it mean that all the shares we had invested in this company no more? Or will be transferred ya?,btohqsg
Hopefully retailers no panic anyhow sell then price can push up to cross $2,btohqsg
It started to be speculative stock due to cheap price and Super good financial performance over very short period of time  there is a transition towards the place where the share price Harmonise with actual performance! Until then  the stock will be too expensive and  risky for contrarians and shortists. It is this transition that will make many retailers give up and repeat the vicious cycle,btohqsg
I cSo medtecs price can't go up,btohqsg
Well yes and no  it depends on the maturity and  of the retail investors   is a supply and demand game. If it is true my a Good stock  seller don‚Äôt want to sell  buyer will bid higher to get the stock in view of Company growth. It is the holding power of the retail investors that play a vital part whether it goes up or down,btohqsg
There is a lot psychological game at play in stock market,btohqsg
There is supply and no demand actually,btohqsg
They make news sometime ago then many ppl rushed in and after that no more queue. So share all stuck inside,btohqsg
Thanks for the analysis  I agree with you too... Doesn't make sense for thaibev to be at tt price... Bbs just playing w the price to collect more at the low.... I feel that this stock is less on chart reading but rather  to know what the bb wants... Too much manipulation,btohqsg
Good growing profitable companies will draw investors  there are buyers but they are not showing you when they are buying   always waiting for moments when sellers give up good stock at cheap price,btohqsg
They announced RTO sometime ago but now seems like RTO not materializing,btohqsg
Hi allWonder if any kind soul here can share this article?https://www.theedgesingapore.com/capital/sgx-research-series-10-10/revez-corp-eyes-5g-extended-reality-and-digitalisation-drive,btohqsg
BB not gonna care 0.565 vs 0.58. too insignificant also. I think they want lower.,btohqsg
I cannot access cos didn‚Äôt subscribe to it.,btohqsg
Thaibev is one of the most shorted stocks on SGX,btohqsg
Agree with u. Medtec has become a stock where very few new investors dare to buy in. It‚Äôs the precious batch investors challenging the BBs in the price war.,btohqsg
Can definitely see they want to get it at lower price than 0.565. But very few panic sellers now I guess.,btohqsg
MedtecsSeriously I learn something new in the market everyday. This stock shows how immature and childish most of its players are (I don‚Äôt even want to taint the word investor)A stock that done 3000% year to date (estimate) is by no means underperforming or no value recognition by market. From a paltry 4 cent to 1.98 high it‚Äôs almost 50XAll I see are plenty of hounding to the IR asking them to help long term investors.What‚Äôs there to help? A company is everlasting by theory why should it be bothered with share price actually? Especially when they are making good money and with access to credit facilities they have no need for capital market.So-called long term investors whine at the share price and complain of manipulation. Don‚Äôt see anyone complain it is being manipulated to 50X returns? How long term exactly are u?You bought in a sexy theme and want long term returns in the shortest time possible and when it is not happening you complain and whine and scold management  exchange  bb and anything elseExcept yourselfEnd of the day you are the greedy shit who chased and got caught at high (no self blame) and want the long term multibagging returns in shortest time possible. Nothing wrong wanting big returns  that‚Äôs everybody‚Äôs aim in the market but the whining makes you a class below the rest. Or none.Everyday say TG better  tan sri support price blah blahGo buy TG la!!!! Ironic when you claim this girl can be the best wife and you decide to go for the spitfire instead and compare on a daily basis.Only your own life ends up miserable. But nope u decide to spread the negativity but it breeds and multiplies  it doesn‚Äôt get any lesser for ownself,btohqsg
You decide to buy the stock and make ownself miserable by whining daily.Cut and move onLike a timely divorce. Good for all parties if things not working out,btohqsg
Always amazed with bro furion posts.Haha,btohqsg
How? Can I fwd to mt chat? Got copyright or not,btohqsg
MT chat should be all long term holders right?People will whine meh,btohqsg
Many whine..I told them dont keep kar jiao mt... gana niao back,btohqsg
Then can't consider them LT holders loh.Normally those whining should be those short term trading one ba inclusive of myself haha,btohqsg
Always?I thought u just entered ytd?,btohqsg
Go ahead. But Kanna kick out don‚Äôt blame me,btohqsg
Yup your first lost I read and I am already amazed,btohqsg
Gek gek till very real haha,btohqsg
All hate to admit they are punters. Hide under pretext of investors look more righteous to kpkb,btohqsg
End up just some who can‚Äôt bear admitting they are wrong,btohqsg
it's normal n ok to grumble when lost money... but mt is abit too much...It's like a kid score 99 marks on exam n gana whack by parent for not scoring 120... against a paper that's 100 full mark,btohqsg
Handsome yang went from being called handsome in Aug to being asked to resign now,btohqsg
Buy a ppe stock few months all become ppe experts on how to run the business,btohqsg
It's not only MT la I can name a few stocks hereThe problem is there are a few people actively promoting it when it's on a bull runWhen it can't substain it's bull run and drop back they console people saying it will ride back up with its undervalue etcWhen it didn't you will end up a bunch of people whining loh,btohqsg
Honestly I don't think there is anything wrong pointing out stuff when other companies are doing it asking MT to do the same.What is longterm and what is short term is based on one's own investment horizon isn't it?It is a little uncalled for to call shit and get aggressive. It is your opinion vs someone else's opinion.,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt gem one of those who keep screaming medtec to buy daily,btohqsg
I cut loss and posted here,btohqsg
‚Äú problem is there are people who keep promoting it while it is on a bull‚Äù,btohqsg
I bought 1.6 and 192 and 194,btohqsg
U r one of them or the loudest lol,btohqsg
You can't cut loss then blame me?Lol,btohqsg
At least she bought and cut loss and openly says it lol,btohqsg
Nothing wrong to shout  that‚Äôs like cheering,btohqsg
Better than the guy who bought it and curse the stocks to go down,btohqsg
Ah yes..Mr Lee is a good supporter of MT... we need more supporters like u.I think it's not calling shit la.. it's giving another perspective to MT holders..buy n believe in company...dont expect 1 week wonder...Already up alot le...still expect $1.2 to $2 within 1 week? It's like losing weight ma...at first easy to drop...after that harder to drop...MT seems to do well this week...despite the drop after Q3....hopefully reach new lows of 130 series...slowly building a stronger foundation...Be peaceful and let mgmt do their work,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know he really got buy or didn‚Äôt buy lol,btohqsg
And I realize my mistake since that bull run from 1 to 198,btohqsg
And I never chase again when it's kinda high again.So picking on my calls thats so long ago you must remember me deep deep hahaha,btohqsg
Actually mt really good.... can play long can short.... really not boring n got chance to earn every day...Too bad I dun dare short...not familiar with it,btohqsg
The problem is that most people don't have SL,btohqsg
Key sentence is chance to earn means you can lose also,btohqsg
Yes... including me...Is it true if 1 short a stock  n the stock gana halted before u cover..... u need to pay everyday that it's halted?,btohqsg
I have no intention to insult medtecs investors. If offended  I apologiseMy point is that everyone want their stocks share price to rise  no matter how good or bad the stock is. Liongold shareholders also want to see a replica of past performance. Realistic or not is another issue.We all buy and pray on hope. Nothing sinful about thatIssue arises when it gets negative. And spreading of negativity. Medtecs is just a prime example. Plentiful of examples to go around but it‚Äôs the most symbolic recently.By all means I don‚Äôt think medtecs is a bad company. I do think it‚Äôs undervalued and the earnings power is underestimated by the market. PE less than 5However instead of thinking it is the market fault  I ponder further why market will give such a low PE instead.Ideas I thought Of:Low NAV. Which means the ROA is sky high. Sustainability of such ROA is a big question mark which market gives a big discount forEarnings power. Back to same word: sustainability. All the players are shouting is next 1-2Q. So what‚Äôs after that? Of course the usual story about how COVID is here to stay  how the vaccine is not easily created and even if created  dissemination and production is an issue. Medical field has changed  the demand for gloves and ppe will never go back to pre-COVID era  injection of vaccine also need ppe blah blahI supposed I gave a good summary on the pro-medtecs argument alreadyOne can‚Äôt help but admit regardless  this is the peak earnings period for medtecs. Maybe next 1-2Q form new record but nope the sky is not the limit. Earnings will plateau and the forward earnings will reduce  the market will adjust and punish accordingly. If u think it won‚Äôt happen  read up on tulip mania. So many examples in history and all used the same termThis time is differentPlayers won‚Äôt think so far because they aren‚Äôt investors they just want to make a quick buck. Problem is when their quick buck plan failed is whole world‚Äôs fault except theirs. Which probably speaks volume on their attitude in life. Not a concern not a problem. Something they have to live with and hopefully ponder upon for self-reflection,btohqsg
Got to ask people that short le,btohqsg
People are too in love w the stock,btohqsg
MT is the best trading stock in SGX  else very boring,btohqsg
Most of the stocks can‚Äôt really move,btohqsg

Let many people escape Liao loh,btohqsg

Although I seldom agree with you but I agree with you on these 2,btohqsg
Since they are here to stay we got to accept it haha,btohqsg
till date unable to proof your 300 lots in JT,btohqsg
All stocks need a good theme to fry. In this case on ppe.If u can‚Äôt recognise the fact they thrive on a theme to garner public interest and the price swings are more lucrative than a straight line up for themIf u can‚Äôt recognize a theme is key to the frying u are at the wrong place,btohqsg
very easy to spot your shit,btohqsg
what ever you say liao toh liao? gone?means you are vested in shorting or sold,btohqsg
showing your 300lots JT not hard,btohqsg
i am not even concerned about if you buy 69 cents,btohqsg
at lest cpck is honest about ifast,btohqsg
you are are a shit mouse that lies and spread false and fear,btohqsg
cpck set unrealistic target but honest,btohqsg
you dreamz are seriously.i already said yesterday.you got issues,btohqsg
AJ1977agree with you on thaibev.but lucky for us when BB play down,btohqsg
If u willing to prove it once  u will shut others up.,btohqsg
Wah now can't tag wayne le,btohqsg
Go back and read again the message please. Did it not say shit and below low class? You must be kidding if you think there is no demeaning intent.What is wrong in expecting a company to pay more dividend or reward investors better. Stock market is a place of greed. Anyone who thinks not is fooling himself. What is short term for you maybe long term for me.Every opinion is good for this forum but not the demeaning nature of comments.,btohqsg
yesterday i tagged wayne.he asked whycouldnt respond cause when for drinks with friends (very rare occasional for my age already),btohqsg
u show proof give us all diam diam lai,btohqsg
u macham those type today buy car  then say wah my car liao. next week my car sure kenna burn. u all better dont buy my car brand. the company no good.,btohqsg

300 Lots in JT  my heart beating now,btohqsg
Ok admin has spoken let's move on please,btohqsg

If he spread fear again I believe wayne will do something about it,btohqsg
Admin will ban first and review later if repeated,btohqsg
ok will move on. but he/she really bad bad.,btohqsg
hopefully. but this was what i was referring to wayne,btohqsg
Thank you all.Lets move on guys,btohqsg
ytd really no time to point it out for you,btohqsg
I suppose you tag the wrong personI make no apology for my comments except to highlight I don‚Äôt refer to all who are investing in medtecs but the whining players daily. If u feel I‚Äôm referring to u then so be it it‚Äôs your own preference.As u said it‚Äôs their own opinion and this is mine. Whether I like what I say doesn‚Äôt matter. I respect you got your right to voice your thoughts. I just make it explicit on my distaste for the whining players.As for language  worse has been said on exchange management and bb. Don‚Äôt see anyone standing up for them so I  stand by my use of language. In this instance not sure your reaction is due to dislike of me or felt it‚Äôs being referred to u.Nevertheless I still respect it,btohqsg
few cornered stocksfor this what is your EP,btohqsg
as mentioned i in for ride down with thaibev,btohqsg
so your bought in price lower,btohqsg
Difficult to answer. I feel this stock got true potential to go to 0.7 in a few mths,btohqsg
good for me i will sell once cross into 65 region or earlier,btohqsg
monday queue 240 you sure get,btohqsg
if cannot up queue again 245,btohqsg
My only fear is ot willi still be up and then they will call for right issue,btohqsg
but as mentioned if chase into strength and dont know your story and etc.dont complain,btohqsg
ShitPH like that still can go up,btohqsg
instead of thisask for view points,btohqsg
Got SL definitely can chase if you wish to,btohqsg
I think a perm ban will be better guess nobody will miss him here haha,btohqsg
you also got shoot him before,btohqsg
i really is cannot tahan already,btohqsg
Can't keep harping on it ma,btohqsg
2 time still this guy repeat,btohqsg
He's like your target board ma that's why I said maybe you will miss him if he's forever gone,btohqsg
not interested in targetting anyonei enjoy this group,btohqsg
that is why i hope while it being dynamic.it provides some value.as mentioned when furion goes away i see not much point to stay also,btohqsg
I stand by what I said. They are demeaning irrespective of who they are meant for.BTW I think what you really mean is market is giving correct valuation for MT. I disagree. How do you explain all the glove counter PE then. Demand factors are more or less same for them as well.I feel due to many factors such as high float  not so streetsmart management in protecting the market cap and valuation  generally weak retailers is contributing to the high volatility. One way of correcting this situation is what Top glove did by doing a share buyback. I just don't buy the argument that company does or should not bother about their share price. I am sure MT owners will be counting their millions based on their shareholding.,btohqsg
Better to kick more toxic peopleüëç,btohqsg
To be honest I definitely think bro furion is referring to people like me that are in for the short term but whine when stock don't move according to their expectations.I don't think his post is meant to dig at those real long terms holders,btohqsg
+1mid to long termers are usually not included in furion mentioning from the way i read,btohqsg
So what you think medtecs price will be?,btohqsg
I whine after I cut loss,btohqsg
MT is unique in that market price forward,btohqsg
At least let me whine a bit la,btohqsg
but is mr market right or wrong,btohqsg
furion mentions ROA and sustainability for profits,btohqsg
I can't blame the stock ma,btohqsg
Previously I mentioned MT won‚Äôt cross $1.4 but it hit $1.59. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
so as mentioned early MT using PE to assess quite not accurate,btohqsg
but it is dependent just like JT on how covid extends,btohqsg
winter comes + 3 months spreadso can expect to see until next year may for covid,btohqsg
thie is for the forseeable futuredmf price up cause plastic (will assume is swabs)so JT profitssame for MT but MT secures in order whether can consistently do it like TG,btohqsg
mr market for business also like that one globes good earn,btohqsg
then will soon be more aspens,btohqsg
for mid term due to covid,btohqsg
Okok didn't follow all the posts,btohqsg
have to look at covid signals,btohqsg
think everyone is tired out by bad news and feeling fatigue,btohqsg
so can see the guard against covid is dropping,btohqsg
and the virus staging a resurgence,btohqsg
This group is good cuz we have admin here. This morning saw some one posted on Jiutian ShareJunction mentioned that JT is 95% gone case. Provided this type of statement with no fact and no proof may frighten some people which is no good...,btohqsg
but the bigger issue is trump earlier mentioned heal the virus at the cost of economy is wrong (which i agreed),btohqsg
now Singapore lousy leaders also changing tack,btohqsg
yet government sees a prevalent and big issue,btohqsg
this gap in covid expectation may actually cost covid to spread more and thereby still give room for medical to run,btohqsg
anyway the target for any decent vaccine with good distribution and production is by 2022,btohqsg
we are 1.5 year ahead of schedule,btohqsg
follow professions (neutral professionals) view pointstake in both side good and bad.exercise critical thinking,btohqsg
read a bit understand a bit,btohqsg
"Just to be clear...I am a supporter n longist of MT...u can see my previous post..What I am saying is  don't keep whipping the donkey and complain it's not moving fast enough..Has anyone ever stopped to think that we ourselves are to blame for this week's ""crash""?MT was very bad in Sep...down to $1...we pushed the management for actions...so they said will release something in Oct...finally Oct the price seems to stabilise at 110 120 range....last Fri close 122 I believed...then in anticipation of good Q3 results  the price got fried up on Mon and Tue to 159...before finally correcting to 120s....this might be BB telling us don't play punk on the shares...don't fry it up so quickly...let it slowly raise...Yesterday closing of 132 to me  I see it as a win vs last Fri 122...If this week Fri can close above 140  it is definitely a good sign...every week up 0.1 still not good enough?U want the share to suddenly spike up to $3 and then crash back to $1?? How many ppl will die if that happen?Just treat all these corrections as mandatory SL imposed to us by the market....hold on to your shares if u can n ride the wave..If u want to contra  also fine...but be prepared to earn n lose...I only see people complain when they contra lost...I don't see ppl openly celebrate when they win on contra...",btohqsg
you will see that sometimes people like trump is right (while other leader whom we think will not lie or what like sg leaders on mask wearing are dead wrong),btohqsg
i dont visit SJ often nowadays.they are not wrong to fearbut we can only see it when announcements are out.totally nothing you can do now,btohqsg
as mentioned these people now say halt no news bad news,btohqsg
if JT says privatisation at 11 cents,btohqsg
you think where all these jokers run to,btohqsg
there were also some typing about rights etc,btohqsg
if cannot afford rights dont average down?,btohqsg
Well said sirIndeed a true longist!,btohqsg
The truth is both longist and contra longist both want price increase  but the latter prefer shoot up max for obvious reasons,btohqsg
Rights n placements are possibilities to get stronger financially when sentiment good,btohqsg
... half agreewhen you making supernormal profits why need rights and placements,btohqsg
for example MT making profits beyond assets on company now say i want rights,btohqsg
They know supernormal profit will not last. Maybe for another half year. So now it is good window to shore up the finance.All just my view only,btohqsg
then you will be the bigger sucker,btohqsg
and the counter party to the bigger sucker is management,btohqsg
they cannot manage the finances when in good times,btohqsg
I am not saying market is giving a correct valuation for medtecs.I‚Äôm just considering what could be possible factors to explain the consistent underperformance compared to some other medical counters. In this instance u refer to gloves.Only time will tell if mt or gloves valuation are right. I just would like to be proven wrong by finding what could be factors causing the low pricing. Whining the market doesn‚Äôt seem to help all the time. Potentially market could be wrong or ownself. Better to be prepared for both scenarios.I did not say my comments aren‚Äôt demeaning. You could even call them insulting and I think probably you are right. No finger pointing here  even the players will feel they are long term investors and I‚Äôm not referring to them. Self consolationActually nothing wrong with players or investors. A volatile stocks attract players  I punt on them from time to time as well.The worst type are players concealing as investors and constantly whining. Because they feel justified to whine loudly because they are ‚Äòinvestors‚Äô.If you really need a confirmation  and yes I‚Äôm certainly not referring to u. I would like to think you are investing in medtecs and see the need to explain why it‚Äôs good. I think it‚Äôs a robust and useful discussion for benefit of all here.,btohqsg
everyone is puntercause everyone got a price they want to sell at,btohqsg
Lucky I never conceal myself as investor but people disguise me as one,btohqsg
See the self proclaimed investors of medtecsGo 1.98 how many will sell outOr go to their cost price a lot will be glad to dump out,btohqsg
hi gem can you use back your old nick,btohqsg
Great thanks. To be honest I do read all your posts and your post on Vicplas should have been a life saver for many.,btohqsg
Many loh dig up my old posts to say I prompt a buy at high prices,btohqsg
I think by the fact that we are willing to put our hard-earned money onto a counter...we are essentially buying on HOPE....that it will rise....of course dyodd included la.Some call it punting...some call it investing - a rose by any name will smell as sweet,btohqsg
very awkward to not see it,btohqsg
Appreciate both bro furion and buddylee sharing,btohqsg
My motto lehBuy high sell higherBuy low sell highest,btohqsg
Can't cut loss don't blame wor,btohqsg
To me@BuddyLeeMis a valued member of the group.Arguments are based on facts and open to differing opinions.Uncle roger endorse,btohqsg
i type this i go off already,btohqsg
