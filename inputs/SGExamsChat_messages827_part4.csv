at least most of the teachers in my experience,btohqsg
Do u bribe them with food stuff with money underneath to make sure they give you an A?,btohqsg
if they know uw to work hard for ur results they will actually come and help u,btohqsg
i think the teachers are fine even tho they  can be quite eh,btohqsg
it js depends on ur own willingness to step out of the way to do something and study hard,btohqsg
and ‚Äúreadjng notes and doing practice papers‚Äù without clarifying anyth is far from enough,btohqsg
even uni kids seek consultation to clarify things they dont unds talk abt a lvls,btohqsg
Just 1 on 1 is always better imo,btohqsg
cuz its very tailored and detailed to suit what u need,btohqsg
which isnt = to what everyone needs,btohqsg
But got time u for ;) Lestin kor kor,btohqsg
I do occasionally seek help but some teachers legit strictly 8-6 on weekdays only like after that cannot text but i dont blame tho,btohqsg

They don‚Äôt have to share their number  just tele handle,btohqsg
I don't look at my outlook anymore,btohqsg
