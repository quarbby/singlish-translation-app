Hi all! Just gotten my Citi Rewards + Amaze! Can I know what category spend I should avoid paying using this combo? 🙏,btohqsg
Possible to give general examples? 🙏,btohqsg
But that doesn’t take into account credit period given by banks. Say my statement date is 30 November  usually the due date may be 3 weeks from then  say 21 December,btohqsg
That 21 or whatever number of days is free money,btohqsg
Not very significant so to each his own I guess,btohqsg
Think the bank see daily balance on calendar month. So I guess first day of the month should be good,btohqsg
"just saw this very informative video  thanks to everyone for their tips and etc.. on this  may i ask for RHB ""incremental average daily balance""  anyone knows what is this$Xamount that we are looking at?",btohqsg
Bonus of interest will only be paid to the incremental daily balance compared to previous month. The best is to move the entire amount to another bank .,btohqsg
yes  remember to keep at least 1 cent. Need to have money in account when interest is credited.,btohqsg
oh i misunderstood it  ok thanks,btohqsg
