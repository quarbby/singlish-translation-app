Would like to check with the experts. If i use the trust cashback on the selected category but didn't fulfill the 3 months min 500 spend do I still get the minimum 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Hey all  does anyone know how to see the statement date (e.g. 1 September to 30th September) forCiti cashback+ credit card?I just looked at my past statements and they do not state the date range for the given month. Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Do you guys have any pages/group posting latest promo deals of flights?,btohqsg
The statement date is the last date of that statement month. The next day is the first day of next statement month.,btohqsg
The thing is  the statement does not indicate any datesIt only showed Payment date dueSo  I have no idea when the start/end dates of the statement are,btohqsg
You can also check with CSO.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  i have submitted GIRO application with hsbc EGA account to pay for my posb everyday credit card 2 weeks ago  but i just received my dbs statement and due to pay next early next month. Giro application is still in process but shd be set up soon.1. Any possibility that once the giro arrangement is approved  i call in posb to ensure they transact by giro on due date?2. If i miss this payment  and incur late + interest fee  what is the chances of posb waiving the fees? (I know scb is no no  but how is posb?),btohqsg
Giro set up take at least a month. If your next posb card bill did not indicate that it will be deducted by giro  then you definitely must pay manually first,btohqsg
If you already receive statement and it does not say pay by GIRO  then make manual payment as usual,btohqsg
Wah  must remember not to use it then. Thanks üôè,btohqsg
Huh. I tot u should sayOk I will make sure I hit the min spend.,btohqsg
Lol... I can only make it for 1 month the most. So forget it. Stick to amaze+ crmc.,btohqsg
Also need the have min spend of $1 per transaction ü§£,btohqsg
If i miss this manual payment  (incur late fee and interest)  and the statement roll over to next month.2. What is the chance of getting waiver with posb?,btohqsg
Dont. Just pay it. Late fee and interest ain't jokes.,btohqsg
GIRO usually takes about 3-4 months to complete. Merry Christmas to you in advance üéÖ üéÑ.,btohqsg
Until your card statement says that it will be paid with GIRO on the due date  just assume nothing is complete and pay the card manually,btohqsg
Your statement will show if the payment will be deducted via giro. Look out for that.If at the point of statement generation they don‚Äôt have the giro setup  DBS/POSB will not utilise it even if it is setup subsequently.An exception to this is CitiBank. That one you really have to call and find out.,btohqsg
Scb does have alot feedbacks that waiving is/near impossible.But i havent heard of member's waiving experience with posbüòÖ,btohqsg
As advised by us  better don‚Äôt let this happen. There could potentially be trailing interest charges as well. It is going to drive you nuts since each bank also have minimum interest chargeable.You can do a fast transfer on the date due if not deducted if you really want to since most - with qualifier as most  banks have up to 3 days grace period for posting of payment.,btohqsg
jsut as a gauge   how much interest are we paying for every $10k overdue ?,btohqsg
Calculate using overdue amount  CC interest rate  GST and late fee (if applicable).,btohqsg
Hi all  can I deposit foreign currency into my HSBC EGA account at branch without charge ?,btohqsg
Paper notes always have surcharge. Even if taken.,btohqsg
What is the surcharge like ?,btohqsg
Ok offhand I don‚Äôt know. But from my memory of scb they only accepted usd and only clean bills with no markings.Example I bring 50 notes. Maybe 4-5 pieces will be rejected.Suspect they may not even accept all currencies too.,btohqsg
Suggests they accept cash but I have my doubts.,btohqsg
This is Dbs. Which u can use as reference.,btohqsg
Hi new to credit card scene. How does UOB one credit card compared to City Rewards card?,btohqsg
You are comparing chicken to cow. One is for cashback and one is for miles üòÖ,btohqsg
thanks . around $228 per mth  or $7 a day for every 10k,btohqsg
Remember it starts counting from transaction date  not due date.,btohqsg
Those who submitted your CICT rights subscription. Money haven't deduct hor. Weird.,btohqsg
I ever paid 99.6% of my outstanding bill with just 0.4% outstanding due to miscalculation. The bank charged me 5.9% (interest + service fee) of total bills 100%. Luckily bank waived the charges.If your outstanding is $10k  under the same scenario  you will be charged $590 one day after due date.,btohqsg
hmm.. shouldn't the interest and fee be based on what you did not clear off?,btohqsg
I questioned CSO the same. CSO said no  it is total bill.,btohqsg
From my understanding  bank always calc interest based on your total bill  i.e. 100% + 27.8% (not the exact amount) then proceed to waive the 27.8% interest if you pay bill on time. But if you only pay 99.6%  this 27.8% won't be waived and now you own the bank 0.4% + 27.8%. üòÖ,btohqsg
For Citi prestige welcome sign up offer  didn‚Äôt exclude any hospital bill in t&c. Do we have any data point here that hospital bill will be counted as eligible transaction?,btohqsg
Can share the TnC you read for us to check?,btohqsg
Should be this one. Citi indeed doesn't exclude hospital bill  insurance for welcome bonus spend requirements. I never tried so can't comment. üòÖhttps://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/prestige-credit-card/pdf/online-acquisition-offer-tnc.pdf,btohqsg
Citi also have giro information on the statement,btohqsg
