let’s say rite after I grad then I work as intern,btohqsg
can I like get my uni offer and differ for 1 year,btohqsg
cos one of my mentors is like doing intern now to see if she rlly want to do lab work,btohqsg
she’s in nus she didn’t apply this year,btohqsg
i think intern is a valid reason no?,btohqsg
no this is not like ur mandatory intern,btohqsg
it’s like after the intern for poly they offer to keep you for another yesh,btohqsg
like they give u job offer,btohqsg
so it’s sort of like a gap year,btohqsg
and what's the benefit to the uni to reserve the place for you,btohqsg
nvm it was a honest question,btohqsg
the reason for my question and answer is:When you want another party to accede to your request  there must be some benefit usually,btohqsg
Asking if there is such a thing,btohqsg
which has already been pointed out that there isn’t,btohqsg
if u get what I mean  then you get it. It's ok 😊,btohqsg
you can LOA i believe if you just go in but they might just ask you to reapply in +1 year  of course it's a risk la if lets say the IGP goes up then you happened to get caught outside of it,btohqsg
ya best to email the admission dept,btohqsg
these kind of thing dont play with fire and ask reddit/tele,btohqsg
seriously why not just do an industrial attachment during uni,btohqsg
ya just dont ask reddit/tele without emailing cause its quite impt,btohqsg
but what you rly want is a gap year while they 'reserve' your slot right? what i can suggest is you go in 1 year then 2nd year or something you LOA  it's a very common approach,btohqsg
then you don't have to worry about risking your admission or something,btohqsg
unless you're saying that 'oh i wanna test water first before enrolling into this course',btohqsg
a lot of my friends LOA y2 y3 or even after 1st sem but they alr know that they are sticking with their course,btohqsg
cos idk if I want to further into research work,btohqsg
cos if I don’t I most likely will just become a teacher lorl,btohqsg
further into research work? You already done your degree?,btohqsg
cos got passion and then money is not bad ahh,btohqsg
don't think there's a lot of research in bachelor degree,btohqsg
research work? it depends on the course you go also  the more common one that extends into doing research work postgraduate is psych or life science that kind,btohqsg
atleast i passed all my mods,btohqsg
we are living in a world  a ex-gang leader can become a buisness owner,btohqsg
its not about how many of these people exist..its why these people exist and how we can learn from them,btohqsg
"""grades are not everything"" is just a populist statement",btohqsg
its hard to pursue being an local artist cause sg doesn’t invest a lot in the arts,btohqsg
unless you wanna travel to america or sk to be an idol / actor,btohqsg
its rlly hard to adapt to new environments cause you hv to learn new language / culture and everything. celebrities suffer a lot since their privacy is being invaded all the time. most fans are obsessed w them,btohqsg
there has to be a conscious effort to become the latter..especially in singapore,btohqsg
"""Money isn't everything""And in latest news:1) Increase in bus fares2) Increase in water prices3) Increase in electricity prices4) Increase in petrol prices5) Increase in COE",btohqsg
Anything isn't important until it is,btohqsg
oh btw@keane223  you know ms karishma ?,btohqsg
Grades are not important.Until someone get something that requires it and you really want it but you don't get.,btohqsg
right even if i hate studying  i hv to burn the midnight oil to secure a good job that is able to give me a good wage,btohqsg
ya my pure chem teacher. goated,btohqsg
she is always online giving us qns to do even at 4am,btohqsg
Add one more word:at least 7 hours rest declared,btohqsg
i honestly feel like its a over complication of life,btohqsg
her aim for my class is 99% distinction cause my class is the strongest in the cohort,btohqsg
yea she will help u at anytime of the day  she even offer consultation session at 7am,btohqsg
can la  o lvl usually will get dist if prelim alr B3 or A2,btohqsg
this kind of teacher is v hard to find,btohqsg
even my year head is v goated,btohqsg
meanwhile half my school's teachers left after my cohort graduated  i know because my bro was in the school 2 cohort after me,btohqsg
true sometimes i wonder if she sleeps but im v grateful she helps us,btohqsg
@keane223do you think ms lim wears lipstick,btohqsg
im buying her peripera mood ink for grad gifts,btohqsg
I believe there is a line between passion and reality,btohqsg
I mean if ur passionate about ur work rite u love what ur doing but u can get out enough money to pay the bills then life’s gonna suck,btohqsg
ooo that’s cool  i heard from my life science friend say that they got direct pathway to postgrad research,btohqsg
I heard that nus is like more interdisciplinary compared to ntu biological sciences,btohqsg
i mean if you get a job with research then you can def pay the bills like that’s not an issue,btohqsg
and within the bachelors degree you’ll def have opportunities to do research like as an extra thing,btohqsg
from there you can decide if that’s what you wanna do long term,btohqsg
gap years are fine but i’d usually recommend that for people that dk what major to pursue. if you alr know then it’s not worth to do an intern for it imo unless it’s a rlly rlly good one,btohqsg
bc within your major you’ll have time during the degree to explore,btohqsg
pay the bills + my expensive ass hobbies,btohqsg
my hobbies are technically my side hustles too do,btohqsg
i mean life science is a lot more diverse in job opportunities than you think,btohqsg
i mean if you do life science then do CS mods it opens a door into bioinformatics,btohqsg
it’s way too much of a stigma that if you do a hard science in uni,btohqsg
you can’t pay bills unless you teach or study more lol,btohqsg
anyway my suggestion is fr to go into your undergraduate with an open mind and explore opportunities through interns or research with profs,btohqsg
even stuff you may not think you’ll like  no harm giving it a shot to be sure,btohqsg
if next time you wanna try interning w astar or smth lmk and i can ask,btohqsg
I think they only accept interns that are under a star scholarship,btohqsg
yea but from back door is different,btohqsg
other poly module got grade cap when retake,btohqsg
no haha  she just wear PE attire,btohqsg
is ok u still can get 3.9 gpa in a course u get nubbad,btohqsg
I need to start studying alr,btohqsg
nvm I start studying next week,btohqsg
I want to redo my table,btohqsg
she gets free my class tee frm mr ho while we had to pay $17 for one,btohqsg
another book i recommend is atomic habit,btohqsg
studying is better then reading books about studying,btohqsg
ik lol my year head recommended to some students,btohqsg
my frnd asked me how to study and idk how to explain to them so i bought it for grad  gift,btohqsg
unrelated but anyone is looking to get fish,btohqsg

every teacher must give grad gifts,btohqsg
then tmr we getting to wear grad gowns,btohqsg

lee li kang… she has been in gdlss for 10 yrs,btohqsg
Bruh my poly system is so fucked my friend had a fabricated mc with error approved for loa,btohqsg
@keane223we make ms kerry lim do this,btohqsg
why ur sch look so fun sia,btohqsg
The guy changed the issue date of his mc to a date that was 1 month in advance via editing software…the mc was still accepted and approved,btohqsg
The system knew and even emailed a message telling him the date was wrong,btohqsg
im reading slides for next sem,btohqsg
i think this is where it ends,btohqsg
Some days I honestly feel like my school is cheating a system other times it feels like it’s a joke of a school,btohqsg
bruh worst I fr will just drop out of poly,btohqsg
why is someone talkin bout suicide in my poly’s tele 💀,btohqsg
for legal reasons it is a joke,btohqsg
keep them motivated to enter poly ig,btohqsg
haha i cant believe they agreed to participate haha,btohqsg
why is your school so old,btohqsg
Omg are you the creator of,btohqsg
anyone magical can give me the breakdown how to calculate these 3 as if u have no calculator lol,btohqsg
oh i rmb that time i grad they also put performance for us lol,btohqsg
I rmb my primary school graduation like it was yesterday…one of the music teachers sang a Original song mixed with eng and chi that was specifically designed for that school I was in,btohqsg
I did not bring my old passport,btohqsg
I’m at Khatib now and my appointment is at 3.15,btohqsg
i think dunnid if u taking frm post office,btohqsg
cuz last yr i go take then they nvr ask for my old passport,btohqsg
I go home and get my passport and come back I will probably only reach like 4,btohqsg
then right i bring ic but i apprantly still need my birth cert. 💀,btohqsg
for mine we needed to dance. it was so ugly. and is on yt,btohqsg
I ended on time and would have made if my dumbass checked the email,btohqsg
when i felt unwell my encik dropped me home,btohqsg
the graduation song fro  my school is as well,btohqsg
rip this person I feel u,btohqsg
have yall ever argued with your parents so many times that u no longer get angry,btohqsg
yeah for me its like the same argument so many times that i know what they’ll shout and at the end we’ll js be saying the same damn thing every time we argue 😂,btohqsg
difference is my parents genuinely angry im like bruh,btohqsg
blame my insane luck for that,btohqsg
hope i get 3 CAs a week,btohqsg
lanjiao every week our station at least 3 CAs on average,btohqsg
i think i can go buy 4D already,btohqsg
after i say u got skill issue,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-ZBSGJR6UUImagine shutting down a whole govt..that is some next level clowning by the US,btohqsg
would be a travesty for anyone that doesn’t pass,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etUW7BVFzZMVid of my primary school graduation song (1 cohort after me),btohqsg
This is the annual negotiating tactic by them,btohqsg
Nth to see  they will wait until last minute and sign,btohqsg
First time it happened was like 2011 or something,btohqsg
Since then it’s like an annual event for their congress and senate to wayang,btohqsg
in its history  only happened 3 times...and so far its all been within one decade,btohqsg
No la never fully shut down before  the debt ceiling they may furlough staff etc  but they always end up signing before defaulting,btohqsg
It’s just a game to them lol,btohqsg
rip the federal employees loosing jobs,btohqsg
I think backpaid once they sign off,btohqsg
If they default you can’t undo it  cause everyone won’t trust them any more,btohqsg
So they will play until almost default,btohqsg
“Shut down” is just them telling people go on no pay leave but in the end also backpaid and all return to normal,btohqsg
Is just a matter of choosing who to print money for,btohqsg
The Us Debt went up 10 Trillion from2017-2022to 30 trillion in 5 years..now in just the last year it went up by 3 trillion to 33 Trillion,btohqsg
i honestly feel like they are going to start printing banana money at some point,btohqsg
Because of inflation and because of the money they do print - it’s not actually necessarily a bad thing. That money just represents the potential of their country to produce wealth equivalent to that money. If they for example: really printed double the amount other countries refused to print  the value would of  course fall by half. But other countries are not stupid  they will print at the same rate to keep things in balance.,btohqsg
The real things countries do apart from print money  like make carbines  or computers or cars or whatever - that’s the real value of the money yet to be realized,btohqsg
So yeah  the money itself can be overprinted  but the US genuinely does produce a lot of stuff other people want and like  and they can keep doing that because of some really big reasons like the biggest military to help their friends  so the friends are ok if their government spends/prints a lot of money - it helps them somewhat sometimes.,btohqsg
But of course there’s a limit  but no one important doesn’t trust the USD yet,btohqsg
buying into SSB now is like putting your money under your pillow now,btohqsg
u won't know the interest 10 years later,btohqsg
plus also won't know if the market is going into recession or not,btohqsg
so SSB is a good place to park spare cash for emergency use,btohqsg
anyway each Singaporean only max 200k,btohqsg
yeah jus saw it  3% for 1 year so i guess its pretty good,btohqsg
getting 3.8 on my ocbc so no reason to buy ssb hehe,btohqsg
the deal may not last 10 years. Subject to changes,btohqsg
though I think interest and mortgage rates should stay at current levels for the health of the economyLow interest rates came in because of the crisis in2008/2009  and stayed there for way too long,btohqsg
if only my nsf pay can meet requirement also haha,btohqsg
put into another bank account. Paynow to yourself as salary,btohqsg
After that just apply from Internet banking,btohqsg
I have been applying for it on a monthly basis last 3 months,btohqsg
but its super liquid! i can take and use anytime and not worry abt it not being safe or cannot take when i rly need to,btohqsg
SSBs are just as safer but slightly less liquid,btohqsg
but honestly for most people in this grp  the age probably don't need that much emergency funds yet,btohqsg
just troublesome imo to deposit and withdraw.. but with our net worth idt that few decimal place % matters even if its slightly better in normal interest rate env hahahaha,btohqsg
why you suddenly disappear frm discord,btohqsg
you know IB tested coinchange for prelims practical,btohqsg
do they even teach dp LOL,btohqsg
ok but a lvl will prob test u,btohqsg

ok yr wats wrong w u,btohqsg
idk I can’t math on iPad,btohqsg
ive been mathing on my ipad for a long time  basically i have like 20 past year papers that ive completed on it  saves the clutter and searching through a stack to find a paper to review:),btohqsg
also when i re do a qn i dont completely waste the paper,btohqsg
redo in my notebook after tutorial,btohqsg
and i can draw straight lines without a ruler,btohqsg
yeah  i use paper when necessary also,btohqsg
Cuz ultimately exam is still pen n paper,btohqsg
Idt I'll be so pro for uni,btohqsg
Assuming I make it to uni tho,btohqsg
i was pro paper too until i got my ipad recently  then now i’m noob paper,btohqsg
i think for me is because i can easily erase if i write wrongly or write it ugly plus no need to deal with stack of papers and storing or lugging around  but in terms of the “feels” i’m still pro paper,btohqsg
they have sick rm so u still need to take the exam,btohqsg
cant tell if youre srs on this comment,btohqsg
If yr is serious then I must have a future,btohqsg
so your name is valid or invalid.. cuz it says FutureOfRyan,btohqsg

It’s not ppl still pay for virtual assets,btohqsg
didn’t know plant-based egg is a thing,btohqsg
I kind of expected NFTs will die  there really is no novelty owning a digital asset,btohqsg
Sure you can use blockchain to tell other people that you truly own this NFT but like  other than that  is there any practical use in NFTs?,btohqsg
There's plant based everything these days,btohqsg
