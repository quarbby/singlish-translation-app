Hello everyone I recently registered my credit cards (Citi Cashback+ and SC SimplyCash) with MoneySmart and SingSaver. I'm considering linking these two cards to the InstaReM Amaze. If I use the Amaze card for online purchases (like on Shopee  Lazada  or the Apple Store website) to earn points  will I still qualify for the sign-up rewards (such as cash or items) from SingSaver and MoneySmart? There's a minimum spend of $500 to earn these rewards  and I'm unsure if binding with Amaze and use Amaze card to pay will  affect this eligibility ? thank you.,btohqsg
Thank you. In additional   is there any better way other than binding with Amaze?,btohqsg

Does it makes more sense to use a miles card for big ticket item like wedding stuff or cashback card?,btohqsg
depends  how much miles you can get vs how much cashback and how much u value miles. But miles cards usually have higher caps,btohqsg
Not sure if this helps  but last year I had used OCBC best senior credit card to make major appliance purchases 12/24 months installments. You get cashback/OCBC points even if it‚Äôs installment.But if not wanting to limit to Best Denki  Atome may be the best choice.,btohqsg

A smaller consideration is the rounding where Visa Signature has the advantage.Though the decision between VS and PP is entirely dependent on whether you will spend more or less than $1k on it,btohqsg
