Brent Crude Oily 🛢️ just climbed above >$88per barrel mark as investors continued to assess the demand outlook while bracing for tighter global supplies. The reopening of the Chinese economy has given markets reasons to be optimistic about a rebound in crude consumption this year  with authorities saying that the number of Covid-related deaths and severe cases in China is now 70% lower than peak levels in early January. A lower-than-expected rise in US crude inventories and a weaker dollar also supported oil prices. Data from the EIA showed a 0.533 million barrel increase last week against forecasts for a 1 million barrel gain. On the supply side  OPEC will likely maintain current oil production levels when they meet next  keeping supplies tight.,btohqsg
