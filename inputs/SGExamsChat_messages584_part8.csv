i ended up self studying tho,btohqsg
My Phys Cher says he gets that much  shd be close,btohqsg
3y teaching job ez what  if you got masters def shorter than that,btohqsg
"""those who can  do; those who can't  teach""",btohqsg
Most of them don‚Äôt have marketable degrees to begin with  like Physics  math  linguistics. Career wise not that lucrative so I might as well become a teacher,btohqsg
physics and math major not lucrative meh,btohqsg
physics n math can go into finance and it's $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$,btohqsg
Rest all have to settle for some shitty data science / office job,btohqsg
Anyways  now finance almost exclusively hires from CS and tech  the ones that do go into the technical roles like quant researcher have a PhD,btohqsg
Yeah  so bach degree in Phys / maths won‚Äôt help you to break into finance for the most part,btohqsg
which IT makes the most money?,btohqsg
Unless u willing to get a PhD,btohqsg
Ik finance broad  if you‚Äôre talking about HF  they don‚Äôt even use technical math lol  this one needs some fucker who can talk well or has a high GPA  as for quant finance / HFT trading roles  math  physics can  but then again  they exclusively hire high GPA + PhD,btohqsg
coding algo n coding a system that actually works in the real world  - v different,btohqsg
that's the diff between the math guy and the SWE,btohqsg
But still SWE still decent pay ngl,btohqsg
Then ik HF  accounting or all the other bs that has to do with M&A  this one got math grad meh?,btohqsg
Finance hire anyone besides ppl from finance,btohqsg
For quant role yeah  for high finance I heard high GPA from target school is actually pretty decent to break in  there have been history or arts majors with perfect GPA from Harvard and all that getting into bulge bracket IB,btohqsg
High level ones still look for finance major,btohqsg
They just want smart people  can‚Äôt blame them,btohqsg
No matter what i think your grades matters,btohqsg
Finance major 4.0 and mech eng 2.0,btohqsg
Thats why i suggest everyone out here to choose easier majors,btohqsg
I hope this year CS intake not 2k again,btohqsg
but what if it's finance 2.0 and mech E 4.0? then which one will u choose?,btohqsg
Depends on what job is it,btohqsg
If sales i would need see the person,btohqsg
If its quant maybe mech E,btohqsg
Coz u just dealing with numbers,btohqsg
Mech e got higher understanding from all the maths stuff,btohqsg
Yeah high GPA + connections + know how to talk can alr,btohqsg
I nt sure whether finance majors learn abt coding but for mech eng we used tons of software about analysis,btohqsg
Personally i learn about data mining and statics all that as a mech eng,btohqsg
But IB and finance WLB is horrible  you‚Äôre gonna die,btohqsg
but u'll die rich  and that's all that matters üòÇ,btohqsg
Usually people exit once they‚Äôre 30 and go into private equity or hedge fund management  the pay there is still crazy high,btohqsg
So maybe it‚Äôs worth after all,btohqsg
also i think alot of the ppl complaining about IB WLB are humblebragging,btohqsg
Again its. Up to your gpa and connection,btohqsg
Idk abt SG  but I‚Äôve read on wall steeet oasis or some forum like that  the hours are like 17 a day or smth,btohqsg
u won't die from accident and get ur arm cut off,btohqsg
Yeah but you‚Äôre ‚Äúexploited‚Äù to the full,btohqsg
it's nothing compared to physical labourers,btohqsg
You‚Äôre gonna become mentally unstable aft skipping sleep for years lol,btohqsg
That‚Äôs not how it works  in fact I‚Äôd much rather manual labour than a mentally taxing task if the pay rate was the same,btohqsg
Physical labor is shag  but u dont earn 1 million from laying bricks,btohqsg
From his bed to buddy bed,btohqsg
When the no. 1 reason why people  quitting IB is cuz of the lack of WLB,btohqsg
Bunch of ppl asking 20 yr old managing 1 mil,btohqsg
