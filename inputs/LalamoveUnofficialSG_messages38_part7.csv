Played around with lalamove  the rates for same place same dropoff is different morning n night... morning being more and night being lesser,btohqsg
Dont tell me got diamond platinum all,btohqsg
"The thing is the 20min pickup time frame is from lalamove  but in reality many customers are used to a ""grabcar"" mindset where job is assigned to nearest driver - which means arrive in less than 10min. If grabcar  7min alrdy u feel it's too long",btohqsg
If advanced order  the expectation is u are there on_the_dot,btohqsg
The stupid thing also is immediate jobs u must see the timing of the order,btohqsg
Accepted job 1245   reach 1250 but order is 1257,btohqsg
My Rating is 4.18 only lol. Does the rating affect the amount of job you can access to?,btohqsg
