The card yes  not the saving account.,btohqsg
If I just want 1 miles card aside with CRMC  this miles card should be unlimited earnings not capped  can be contactless  Apple Pay or online  which will you recommend? I normally only use the card for big purchases for my business expenses üòÅ,btohqsg
Is it true uob kf credit bonus once every 14 months?,btohqsg
it seems to be once every 11 months,btohqsg
Like that I feel it‚Äôs not ideal.. trapped for 11 months before can cancel the card ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Hi experts  given the rate cuts  what shd be a good typical mortgage package and rate to consider  for around 900k?,btohqsg
anyway most people have to pair it with Amaze to get the big amounts of UOB KF bonus.. which is going to be dead from 1st october onwards..,btohqsg
"also i note your focus on ""before can cancel the card""why you want to cancel the card? if you get a good card  you should focus on how to use it to consistently earn good rewards",btohqsg
Because I worried cannot tahan every time have to wait for a year.,btohqsg
UOB one every quarter credit Sianz liao. HSBC life even further abit but nvm. UOB kf 1 year üòÇ,btohqsg
if you were using UOB KFCC the way the whales are using... (paired with Amaze to buy luxury items at 3mpd uncapped)  you won't complain have to wait 11 months to get big big miles,btohqsg
But going to expire in few weeks with Amaze. Not possible to pair with Amaze already.,btohqsg
I wanna use the card to purchase IT hardware  cloud services subscriptions  some online/offline shopping etc.,btohqsg
Hello. I just got METAPAY charged to my Amaze card but it was auto reversed.,btohqsg
Hi  can I know if grabfood qualify for the 6% under dining for citi cashback card?,btohqsg
Should report to Citi about this anyway. The fraudsters are probably testing if the card info are valid,btohqsg
My amaze is tied to UOB card though. Shoud still report to UOB? I reported on Amaze.,btohqsg
Oops I miss the part about Amaze. To UOB it is a valid transaction triggered from Amaze. Report to Amaze is correct and do block your Amaze card too and get it replaced.,btohqsg
where can i check in the uob tmrw app on my uob lady's selected category?,btohqsg
Do it fast  you have only 1 week left to change if you want to.,btohqsg
Bro  based on ur knowledge  can you recommend a card with higher miles earning than DBS Altitude or at least equv miles earn. I plan to boycott this DBS. I'm looking for the following (not in order of importance) . Thanks in advance.1) Miles don't expire2) not contactless. Prefer to use a physical card to pay.3) have lounge access eg PP4) don't need a dedicated website to earn higher miles. Eg  UOB Expedia for 6 miles . Prefer to book direct with the airline website. I don't mind less miles.I read reviews on Milelion but can't seem to find a suitable card. Does such a card exist?,btohqsg
Citi Premier Miles  1) to 3) from what I know.,btohqsg
This one out of my range . üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Hi bro . Citi iirc is 1.2 Altitude is 1.3.If only Citi is 1.3 I would sign up already,btohqsg

Hi all Masters  if I book a china hotel usingTrip.com  should I pay in RMB to avoid DCC instead of paying SGD? But one thing makes me confused is that Heymax mentionedTrip.comtracks in USD.  So which currency should I use? Any ideas?,btohqsg
You pay in rmb to avoid DCC 1% then get charged with 3.25% fcy conversion. üòÇTrip.compayment gateway is in Singapore so shouldn't be DCC charged I think.In short  sgd,btohqsg
Anybody paid UOB miles conversion fee $25 recently? It seems the $25 is not eligible for UOB One account min $500 credit card spend.,btohqsg
hi friends  new to miles.. have a qns which i cannot seem to find the answer.For citirewards  there's a cap of $1 000.if i spend $1 000 on non-qualifying spend and 500$ on qualifying spend  do i get1) 500x4=2000miles2) 0 miles as I have reached my cap of $1 000 for non-qualifying spend,btohqsg
1k cap is for qualified spend so you will get 2k miles plus 0.4 miles * 1k,btohqsg
Anyone knows if we can withdraw Euros from Spain atm for no fees using trust / YouTrip? üòä,btohqsg
