Thanks for your in-depth analysis on Vividthree  nice work there.,btohqsg
A lot of pennies after distributed can doze of slowly and then finally goes into complete sleep. The sleep can last for many yrs.  Can one wait?,btohqsg
Some doze off but can wake up sometime for a short while cos their ultimate aim is to go complete sleep.Becos their float is so huge thay they need time to distribute.So must take note.,btohqsg
Oceanus really dying. Churn a lot 39-41 many new retailer stuck there,btohqsg
Now vivid3 based $0.059.Honestly I think this one big big potential.,btohqsg
The chart is as clear as daylight! Thanks. I personally did not sell at the high hoping that it would reach $1 and my EP was low...,btohqsg
Yes. Don't base on hear say.Do some counting.May comparision.At 8c the market cap is near 2b.Project earning per share (eps) yourself.Ask yourself can meh.In SG market   investor very stingy one. Don't pay dividend one they won't value so high.,btohqsg
True. I no longer vested - sold off with much lesser proft. What is not mine is not mine. Your chart clearly can see the distribution by bbs. In terms of FA  you are right - overpriced.,btohqsg
Lower lows and trading below all MAs and MACD also pretty bad.,btohqsg
Anyway it's penny stock. Will move when BB decide,btohqsg
Indicators/charts are drawn by the BB anyway,btohqsg
I believe ysday many shortists got caught shorting sinjia even at opening gap up,btohqsg
“Few exciting projects and acquisitions  to further develop our monetisation strategies”I agree with you  many key words here to support your views of big big potential,btohqsg
Ray of liteWhat are your views about ICG (KUO)?,btohqsg
Fully agree 👍 bro Sam. Am just sharing cos I was vested before and rode all the way up but did not cash out then. And Bro Ray of Light rightfully pointed out the distribution by BBs so clearly. And looking at current chart  looks like Bb out? Wait for next group of Bb to come in? Possible or not. Anybody's guess. Too much of a heavyweight for me.,btohqsg
This one I got analysis before.From penny with no fa become fa    once penny turns into Fundemental wth profit   it will be subjected to market valuation.(Speculation phase)U see during penny it rally with their prospect and future earning to a high of 0.09+.(Valuation phase)Then when it slowly churn in profit.  Take it they can earn 20mEPs 20/5734 is 0.0034X10-12 pe is about 3.4 to 4cAnd when shows they can earn more and give dividend  market will then re rate again.,btohqsg
Thks for sharing.. indeed  BB trap 🪤 retailers and ourself exit liao.. next BB otw🤣,btohqsg
Not sure still can buy or not,btohqsg
Not sure can still trust or not,btohqsg
