Hi all  wanna check if Iâ€™m missing anything  if amaze + CRMC can convert all retail to online  then it can essentially replace HSBC REVO?,btohqsg
youtrip on weekends wont face the same issues at trying to use revolut on weekends right,btohqsg
i was able to link my grabpay to youtrip  in this case would youtrip offer over revolut other than being able to use overseas exchange even on weekends?,btohqsg
I hv been monitoring my reward  points. Thereâ€™s no points given for payment like shopee pay and air tickets.,btohqsg
Shoppee pay also don't rewards grab pay points too fyi,btohqsg
I noticed shoppee now Nerf mostly perksBefore the $5 off voucher for certain catagory membership is can use normal modd of payment,btohqsg
So lesser way to double dip to earn points on our card,btohqsg
anyway to earn cashback from paying credit card bills and merchants who only accept nets via grabpay + uob cashback method?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if I can use alternative payment mode for the $10 ntuc voucher from trust. Or must use trust card,btohqsg
Didn't see where to put in referral code for trust bank,btohqsg
Btw if anyone is stocking up on foreign currency for travel  SGD -> JPY is over 100 now,btohqsg
Yes  hearsay slightly lower fx spread for youtrip,btohqsg
Because  SEA Limited is burning money already,btohqsg
Before you signup  there should be a box you click to inout referral,btohqsg
Grab pay card topup to youtrip will get the cash back from grab?,btohqsg
I see  so the only way is revolut yeah,btohqsg
Anyone here using this stack?UOB Absolute -> Grab pay -> Jipay,btohqsg
Nerf alr. Now jipay no more rewards. +2.5% fees. So you basically throw money away,btohqsg
So what way will earn cashback or miles by topping up youtrip,btohqsg
Curious too. Seems like only way to earn cash back with grab pay and cash back credit card is revolut,btohqsg
topping up revolut with grabpay gives you cashback??,btohqsg
yea wondering if grab top up revolut gives cashback ?,btohqsg
Hello guys I'm a student going for an overseas program next year in glasgow whats cards should I use?  From what I see here amaze paired with card that gives cashback ?,btohqsg
Think ðŸ¤” we can double or triple dripUse this trusted card with amex and grab,btohqsg
Swipe or tap for link pointAnd top up grab via amex,btohqsg
Or must pay via this trusted card then can earn link point,btohqsg
For revolut 20% off transport   have to transfer $300 through bank xfer / card.Can I check if topping up 300 through Google pay (linked to bank account) is counted or must be strictly through debit card ?Can I withdraw the $300 immediately,btohqsg
Stick to bank transfer or debit card. You prob can withdraw 300 immediately if its your first time but do enough times like this and you risk getting banned,btohqsg
Hm. In this case citibank master card also won't qualify for topup to revolut or youtrip also?,btohqsg
Or only grab pay is affected,btohqsg
i always maintain $50 balance only so after 300 top up but take out 250. seems like nothing happen so far,btohqsg
Oh revolut can get cashback topping up youtrip?,btohqsg
Apparently not  seems like I was misinformed,btohqsg
Now just wondering if using cash back credit card to directly topup to revolut / amaze / youtrip can get cash back anot,btohqsg
Wanna ask UOB one  that quarterly cashback? When will get it?,btohqsg
Is the 3rd month of the same quarter? Or the follow first next month after the previous quarter end?,btohqsg
The 4th mth u get the cash back for last 3 mnth,btohqsg
I applied credit card at Trust app but then after that I can't find where to open Savings a/c. Any ideas?,btohqsg
No. The only exception is uob absolute and amex tcb to grab. All top up does not get cashback,btohqsg
Anyone going for this month ssb?,btohqsg
thinking putting into tiq. 2.9%  3 yr endowment,btohqsg
Hi can I check whatâ€™s the best Amex card for miles? Thanks!,btohqsg
Just went ntuc buy some ting at the self payment booth I click on the trust card membership ya u can swipe or tapBut the old ntucâ€™s link point card is only swipeSo I can guess u can just tap with trust card and payment use your others cc card to pay so can dip on link Point and other cc card points,btohqsg
Anyone knows if I can use alternative payment mode for the $10 ntuc voucher from trust. Or must use trust card,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGwhatâ€™s your trust card refrrral code ?,btohqsg
Wonder if the trust bank app can install and run on 2 phone,btohqsg
Or itâ€™s lock to 1 device due to security like those bank app and mustâ€™ve sign in if own 2 phone,btohqsg
For $25 coupon only must pay Telco ?,btohqsg
I add card to TL SimplyGo and gotten $25 coupon,btohqsg
Can also use ShopBack Pay and get $2 cashback for $5 minimum spend,btohqsg
