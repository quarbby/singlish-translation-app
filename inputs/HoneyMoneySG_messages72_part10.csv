Hi! For the Ocbc titanium rewards  am I eligible for bonus reward points / 4mpd for online purchases at gain city and other electronic retailer websites?,btohqsg
nope. from 1 nov onwards these retailer is excluded from 4mpd,btohqsg
Oh I see  thanks! In this case  which miles earn card is best for big ticket purchases from electronics retailers?,btohqsg
need to spread out payment on different card,btohqsg
uob krisflyer only on online shopping and need to fulfill the minimum spend on sia/scoot related before u get additional miles.,btohqsg
if pay via kris+ u get the 3mpd,btohqsg
can use UOB KF while paying via Kris+. For example harvey norman has kris+ option (I think Audio House is another one).But must be via Kris+. If not  u need to fulfill Singapore Airlines group minimum spend as has been pointed out above.,btohqsg
I have DBS woman‚Äôs card and Citi rewards but bonus earn only applies for online. For offline purchases  recommended to use UOB KF via Kris+?,btohqsg
kris+ seem to be consider as online transaction according to milelions  citireward with amaze will make the transaction online on kris +.,btohqsg
the value of kris+ miles is higher devalued compare to those in krisflyer account so have to transfer miles earn within 7 days on app to the krisflyer account after trandaction,btohqsg
but cards like dbs womans card  citi rewards  hsbc revo all have a max spend limit.UOB KF do not have a max spending limit to earn,btohqsg
while that is true but the point earn start it 3 year expiry as the point earn will be credit to krisflyer account directly. other card can be pool as bank point and wait for conversion bonus. so depend on what individual want out of their spend.,btohqsg
with black friday coming  if can wait then best to wait for the deals. just window shop and make shopping list for the item wanted.,btohqsg
Yup looking out for 11.11 deals :),btohqsg
Hi  today is the 31 Oct  I also encounter the same 1 tick instead of 2 tick issue. I really hope that we will receive the bonus interest otherwise I am going to be pissed üò°!,btohqsg
Hi just wondering if there's any cashback card that gives cashback on air tickets?,btohqsg
where to access the no of ticks?,btohqsg
This is wat im considering too  but i realise harvey norman prices can be much more expensive than shopee or amazon  so need to do some calculation to see if it is worth it.,btohqsg
How to access this page in your UOB phone apps?,btohqsg
Yea I also prefer cashback than miles. I planning to buy sq ticket on nov3 sale,btohqsg
accounts bottom tab > select one account > details top tab > scroll down to view activities,btohqsg
Think there's a visual bug for Android version,btohqsg
Actually harvey Norman can do price matching. You can show them the price on lazada or shopee - but must be using shop voucher only not platform voucher.And all the prices can be negotiable  just ask the sales person. Either they can give discount (especially when you buy many in one go) or can throw in some freebies.,btohqsg
Oh  any publication on sale 3 Nov?,btohqsg
Does HSBC advance or citi reward card exclusion include education services?,btohqsg

Hi. Just want to ask a quick question. Is there any Credit card which gives annual miles limit? Iirc the ocbc Titanium rewards‚Äôs TC will be changed from 1 nov :(,btohqsg
No.. SA/MA topup for tax relief is not subjected to the annual cpf contribution limit.,btohqsg
Great thank u for the insights ! If I make the contibution in Nov 2023  it will still be able to get relief for YA2024 ?,btohqsg

Hello! Does anyone knows booking yatch considered as what category for uob ladies? Else is this considered online transaction for DBS WMMC?,btohqsg
Online shopping only on certain cat and u need to fulfil minimum spending on sia grouo before u get 3mpd. Earlier discuss was saying using kris+ merchant get 3 mpd.,btohqsg
Oh I see.. so if I make my big ticket purchase first  before hitting min spend on sia group  the big ticket purchase won‚Äôt qualify for accelerated miles?,btohqsg
The big ticket purchase mcc need to fall under online shopping too to qualify. We are talking about kris + app payment at selected merchant  2 different issue,btohqsg
hi all  was wondering if monthly youtube subscription count as online spending for UOB Evol card,btohqsg
Actl  just a side question if you don‚Äôt mind. Wanted to ask if going to a physical store with correct MCC  if I use UOB KF + Amaze it should qualify for accelerated miles right? The Amaze card will convert it to online spend?,btohqsg

can use smrt citi for online purchase if you are buying more then 500 online and it is annual cap of 12k at 5 percent cashback,btohqsg
hsbc advance  maybank prefer plat(need to hit every month for every quarter)  uob one (need to hit every month for every quarter)  citi cashback plus and alot of base 1.5-1.7 percent card. dcs master also give 2 percent,btohqsg
if u are doing online shopping can consider smrt citi  they give 5 percent cashback after u filfill the 500 spend in a statement up to 12k annual spend within the same statement. effective can get 600 cashback for 1 month and keep the card for next year spend liao,btohqsg
Hi for UOB one credit card  I saw my transaction still indicate pending even though the transaction was on 28 Oct and today is the last day of the month. Will I still be eligible for the cashback or do I wait till tomorrow?,btohqsg
