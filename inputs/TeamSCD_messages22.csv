For learning purpose.We always know we’re at fault when we rear ended the car in front. If claim insurance  NCD will be affected and the premium will increase next year for our insurance purchase.But how much (%) increase exactly ? Like additional $500 ? $1000 more ?Or case by case basis (depending on what car you bang ? 🤣🤣),btohqsg
Hmm gd qns. Tbh  I'm also nt sure if there's a secret formula behind this 😂 probably depends on the overall claim amt and accidents for same make/model,btohqsg
but if other people kanjo  their problem,btohqsg
Just curious  what is the common amount if there’s a surge in premium.,btohqsg
if they langa you  my only way to deal is just go insurance claim. I don't want so much hassle,btohqsg
Based on Asia one article uh,btohqsg

Many years ago when I buang someone's bumper  I remember just exchange photo of ic  phone number and photos of the carplate plus damage. Then at workshop repairs I paid  then sign an agreement form that it has been settled.,btohqsg
good to have but nowadays due to pdpa i think no need to have,btohqsg
What's important is the settlement paper signed,btohqsg
how come you make police report? 😅,btohqsg
i langa some uncle tdy sian,btohqsg

otherwise is just accident report by the wshop,btohqsg
Can renew roadtax means inspection pass right?,btohqsg
Cos i go STA inspection... Den i go vicom website sms check say i overdue,btohqsg
Never driven one  I heard the engine is different from the fd2r and euro r,btohqsg
I do like the look of the car,btohqsg
Or next year sell and buy,btohqsg
Nxt Yr change x70 also can,btohqsg
Still a type r  but not the most desired type r,btohqsg
I wanna buy this so badly,btohqsg
And just change engine to 4g93,btohqsg
Also it's easier to find videos of the fn2r then the euro r,btohqsg
Which is faster euro r or fd2r,btohqsg
Haha only can do in jb,btohqsg
Same engine  but the fd2r is lighter and has shorter gears,btohqsg
It also has a better intake manifold,btohqsg
U ever driven 4g93 wira b4?,btohqsg
The ratios can be changed to match  but the euro r is a heavier car. That one can't change,btohqsg
Also fd2r is a newer model,btohqsg
Euro r came out in 2003 if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
Which is better proton satria neo or perodua myvi,btohqsg
Both probably got gtr engine 😂😂,btohqsg
Satria neo is the one with lotus engine right,btohqsg
Proton managed to make a 1.6 na engine with lotus during 2009 which produces 126bhp and 150 nmt,btohqsg
I’d still go with a satria neo,btohqsg
Yes  my grandmother had a gen 2,btohqsg
Then is the myvi a Daihatsu engine?,btohqsg
She had switched from her charade to that gen 2,btohqsg
The best thing about proton car is the handling and stability during high speed,btohqsg
I remembered her saying the 1.6 was also offered here thiugh,btohqsg
MY grand ma malaysian so I know all this lol,btohqsg
In Malaysia have 1.6 cps with 125hp and 150 nmt,btohqsg
Ahh.. still a good handling car no matter the CC,btohqsg
Haha ice cold.. until it fails,btohqsg
