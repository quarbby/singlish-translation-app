AND ITS COMING BACK FOR MYE,btohqsg
"Luckily managed to be ok with it by ""visualising"" and ""imagining""",btohqsg
"if i see one more ""line"" and one more ""plane""",btohqsg
h2 vectors is ngl kinda useless,btohqsg
Y'all basically can pon h2 math lect with 0 consequences,btohqsg
Do y'all even have to come for it,btohqsg
we got kicked out of our class h2 math tutorial,btohqsg
so yeah we don't need to go,btohqsg
For a levels i had to use vectors to do optics...,btohqsg
so by right on wednesdays and fridays our first lesson is only at 9am,btohqsg
ok not rlly optics  more of reflection,btohqsg
if only i can report when my first lesson starting ☠,btohqsg
OMG BTW 2019 H2 maths alevels paper 2 was a traversty,btohqsg
WHY ARE MY ANS IN WORDSSS,btohqsg
but like the stuff they actually teach us to use in h2 math for vectors,btohqsg
you never really use it ever afterwards,btohqsg
i cannot do 3d visualization for shit,btohqsg
Till this day  i still dont know what are they lmao,btohqsg
one thing i know is that,btohqsg
I thought 2022 was the worst,btohqsg
Haven’t seen that many describe qns in stats before,btohqsg
HOLY FK it can get worseeeee????,btohqsg
Meanwhile my class here having a real nice timetable lmao,btohqsg
my fm tutor seems to think this form for planes is very useless,btohqsg
bruh they all spaced so nicely,btohqsg
they got some award during my year  well deserved,btohqsg
I would love to be in the timetable committee,btohqsg
yea we have  iirc top 10% auto in?,btohqsg
Haha in a way. Yes. But jc1 mye only,btohqsg
my tdp group is still active lol...the ms jane wong still send stuff,btohqsg
i've seen math in english b4,btohqsg
I was invited a day after they introduce evryone LMAOS,btohqsg
They forgot to give me the form for tdp......until the next day....,btohqsg
wait legit? may those that got the prime minister book prize and all that,btohqsg
Oh yea... in the end my pw grp everyone is from tdp.,btohqsg
And we had only 1 A in my pw grp,btohqsg
mine put those at the back,btohqsg
Lelllll why they dont like him :(,btohqsg
different thing completely tho. like yes it's vectors but completely diff  don't have the planes equations shit,btohqsg
They needed one to select people to go to international geog Olympiad,btohqsg
I have a coding quiz on this monday,btohqsg
But i havent studied for coding yet.,btohqsg
is it the data science one,btohqsg
i tot vectors was first topic,btohqsg
Introduction to data science and artificial intel,btohqsg
well it was the first for us but the normal h2 math ppl start with graphing techniques,btohqsg
No cus vectors was a o level clt,btohqsg
So that is why some put as first,btohqsg
But by right graphing techniques is first,btohqsg
Yijc they did graphing technique first,btohqsg
