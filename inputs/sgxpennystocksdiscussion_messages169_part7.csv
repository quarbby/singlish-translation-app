Thanks for your research on Vividthree üëçPreviously I bottomed scooped Secura. Entered $0.0425 - 1000 lots. Probably no retailers have gotten price lower than mine.This time I also collected all the way down to $0.035 but noticed other collectors too.There‚Äôs quite a bit of similarities between Secura and Vividthree in my opinion.The players in this counters also quite similar in some sense.- both IPO $0.25- Secura bottomed 0.038/0.039- Vividthree bottomed 0.035- illiquid at bottom and the market makers gave us chips to play. They need retailers on board lower prices to play together as no retailers will sell at $0.08 below . So they bottom out and give Chips out at the lower prices otherwise there won‚Äôt be any liquidity.- Also  after the we came in to buy more. The BBs came in to stack up Twice54/55 then at59/60Having said that I believe this one even have chance to cross back $0.10 even same as what Secura didHope I am spot on this.I strongly believe they just getting started and this counter will get more and more liquid in time.Also  there will be a lot of catalyst looking at the collaborations they have formed prior and during COVID19.Do note that  they tried to do a placement at $0.126 above too earlier in FEB and Billionaire Ron Sim is vested $2million at $0.215Watchlist. This is upcoming  we gave it heartbeat and BBs interested based on yesterday PA.,btohqsg
I have monitored Secura and Vividthree and Scooped up at bottom. Therefore  I still hav this print screens. Secura market makers also gave ‚Äòtokens‚Äô out for retailers to play. It‚Äôs their way of making a counter get more liquid. But initially you can see there is no buyers and sellers. Then Secura slowly build the momentum and eventually crossed $0.10 in time . Vividthree heartbeat just started. There will be more to come. Trust me guys. There‚Äôs too much similarities and yesterday BBs came in to stack and collect. It‚Äôs just getting started. It will become liquid with more volume in time.,btohqsg
Anyways  Secura I long time out. Just using it as comparison and an example to show how the market maker / BBs make a stock alive,btohqsg
Interesting and intriguing honestly. Damn  ‚ÄòI love this game‚Äô,btohqsg
Note: The play is on Vividthree and Secura is a past example I use to illustrate my point,btohqsg
If not mistaken  either UnUsual or vividthree joint venture with jj lin's company last few months. Not sure if would influence anythingüôä. Just sharing‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Any long period tiger user here?,btohqsg
what question do you want to ask,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt see this announcement for Vividthree. Unless it‚Äôs the gaming related Resurgence or the collaboration with Malaysia content   anime creator company.Likely it‚Äôs for Unusual,btohqsg
Yes. Me too. Every nite cant sleep cos of vp.,btohqsg
It could be. In fact  the news caught my attention because it was published as entertainment newsüòÇ‚Ä¶ only then I know about the companies.Thanks for sharing üëç. Good learning through your analyses and everyone's inputüçí,btohqsg
Ya  pls inform me too. VP still with me. Thanks,btohqsg

Yesterday closing...cement I think will tank further  bulk buy up of 3c and look very promising for next week  JT set to test 10 again... IPS getting ready too,btohqsg
Was just on the road back. Heavy rain and saw at least 7 of PanUnited cement trucks when Otw home. It does looks like it coming. Doing a double bottom reversal set up. Those vested  good luck. Those not vested  this one good for long term investment. Expect them to be $0.4x next year. Good luck. Vested and optimistic.,btohqsg

Collaboration News on Sept 2020Anyone game here and know anything about this resurgence esports?,btohqsg
Resurgence is a huge titan in the E-sport gaming industry. Huge followings in the world with multiple events and competition every year. Singtel is their sponsor too. Together with pvp sport and legion and secret lab. They have an internal team of gamers too that compete in world of E sports.,btohqsg
League of legends. Mobile legends dota all those,btohqsg
Huge upside potential since world of E sports getting recognition,btohqsg
Still camping for dow Jones to go back to 28 range,btohqsg
Vs sea? How's it against its competitor sea,btohqsg
Still waiting for nasdaq to break 12k,btohqsg
Yup  that are a lot of potential catalysts for Vividthree. Plenty of upcoming business developments which is what I fancyThey have intention to raise funds too.Start of the year Feb 2020  they had tried to do a placement at over $0.126Unfortunately  SGX blocked as they still had Balance proceeds from $0.25 in 2018.But their business was affected by COVID19 no doubt that‚Äôs why I assume that if another placement/rights is in plans  likely to be in the $0.07 to $0.09. region. Could even be higher but I prefer to be conservative.,btohqsg
But I really do like that they get into new business segments like resurgence Collab in this difficult period  tells alot about the versatility of management.Furthermore e-gaming is growing and gaining alot of popularity.I used to sell online app gaming items  made a chunk of my initial capital back then  so I do like this move here.,btohqsg
Wah got some guns come . 0.059 .Don‚Äôt think retailer so garang yea,btohqsg
Glad that we triggered the BBs  they really came. 100% not retailers. Unless someone here can tell me they were the one stacking 54/55 at buy and then later on 59/60 after more activity.Looks like 59/60 for Vividthree should be well supported for now.If they willing to collect 59/60   they are going to push it higher to 7/8 series at least,btohqsg
Rose so much until sgx query?,btohqsg
Have to watch PA first next week and see how.I feel it was safer to collect Vividthree at $0.055 or below when I first called.$0.050 and below was ‚Äòfree money‚Äô as I kind of know they finding bottom and market makers will sacrifice And give chips out at cheap to retail players to play.But with BBs coming in to collect and support 59/60 so soon yesterday. It was a Very good sign. I feel 60 and below should be safe to collect for now.,btohqsg
May retrace a bit i guess,btohqsg
