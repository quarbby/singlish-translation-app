We basically rehashed the same content LOL,btohqsg
ok lor guess h2 Geog people are jay not human,btohqsg
where there are instances of that happening  I apologise for it. again  we should be applying our rules uniformly  and those rules apply to both community members and moderators alike,btohqsg
Guess school consultations that do the same are wrong also,btohqsg
These were q some time ago,btohqsg
So its not a big thing,btohqsg
It's stuff that V used to say,btohqsg
U do alr u scared what,btohqsg
Which are along the same lines of what happened jn,btohqsg
scared my syllabus doc Actl hv is it,btohqsg
so means spotting is chit chat la,btohqsg
im personally looking through the deleted messages,btohqsg
not asking a level content questi9on la,btohqsg
h2 geog dont deserve it la,btohqsg
this chat becomes new national exam chat? üòÖ,btohqsg
Yeah cause all the h2 geog content got nukes in the a levels chat cause its not exam related or studies related,btohqsg
@Randkmdkdx4maybe just cannot discuss geog lor,btohqsg
Then the admins haven't reallt clarified why what she discussed isn't allowed yet,btohqsg
tele mod log not the best :),btohqsg
So we pivot to here temporarily cause later everything get deleted again in the other channels,btohqsg
I think its more of just V,btohqsg
I rejoined just to see the drama,btohqsg
u shud see what i send ontop,btohqsg
I would recommend drawing cause it's clearer,btohqsg
And don't need be super detailed,btohqsg
Just make the key points obvious,btohqsg
Like for example if ur comparing the line graph portion then just sketch the line graph don't need sketch the bar graph,btohqsg
ok ah so personally as a moderator  stuff like this is okay  as long as it doesn't go off topic,btohqsg
but when it becomes stuff like this is when it's gets on the other side of the line,btohqsg
and in a sense this is what i mean by it gets off topic really fast,btohqsg
There should‚Äôve been more that was deleted below iirc,btohqsg
yes  my screen is only this big HAHA,btohqsg
i wldnt call this relevant too,btohqsg
There was still even more that was deleted iirc,btohqsg
there was an explaination that was deleted,btohqsg
Actually why isn't this relevant cause she's asking abt some content for geogThen I Need to clarify exactly what she's asking abt so I can help her,btohqsg
I think randkmd typed some explanation with a few lines about the theme 1 geog questions which was deleted,btohqsg
U don't even need the bar graph imo,btohqsg
Just the limbs and flow is it,btohqsg
This is just us expressing confusion,btohqsg
So its not relevant lol but it's an instinctual reaction,btohqsg
I get why it got deleted,btohqsg
"I did not delete any question saying ""what is drainage basin water cycle""",btohqsg
Yeah cause normally hydrograph qn got two types1. Compare hydrograph2. Explain hydrograph,btohqsg
then 'v deleted message' is who,btohqsg
There should‚Äôve been one where I said ‚Äúwait wtf is happening??‚Äùand I recall around then randkmdkd sent the messages explaining more about the dbwb,btohqsg
I think I need get a new pair of specs again ah after just getting one,btohqsg
Draw hydrographs to compare this trend,btohqsg
So for example if uw to compare lag time u draw two line graphs with 2 diff lag times,btohqsg
what did v not have a username so no one can ping him,btohqsg
