we were trying to understand the Lorentz transform and the Minkowski spacetime diagram,btohqsg
i rmb that distinct one LOL,btohqsg
TM has taught me a lot on peer pressure resilence,btohqsg
do not remind me of that shit,btohqsg
specifically TM or JC in general,btohqsg
up to now i still dont understand space time diagrams at all fr i watched so many youtube videos but no gets,btohqsg
Ya too bad my og arent that bonded but oh wells  i learn better alone :/,btohqsg
oh yea then 4 of us were studying for complex right,btohqsg
one of them halfway close laptop like oh i'm done,btohqsg
Like being in a mid-low tier jc  not be too influenced by others that may be a bad influence like my toxic class,btohqsg
What did cyd or csa do to you,btohqsg
i refuse to manifest this for myself,btohqsg
Did he also tell you russian ppl study taylor seires in kindergarten too?,btohqsg

The following have not handed in:Organic Assignment (Jasmine  Valerie  Irwin  Jeven  Martin  Nigel  Lucas)It is way overdue. If you still have difficulty managing your schedule  I will help you by ‚Äòaccompanying‚Äô you to complete it next Monday 13 May after school.,btohqsg
Taylor series start with taylor swift,btohqsg
Maclaurin is centered around x = 0,btohqsg
But Taylor is abt any x term ah,btohqsg
(And then i screwed up the taylor serie,btohqsg
Taylor series is just the expansion. A Taylor series centered around 0 is maclaurin,btohqsg
My chem cher getting mad and madder,btohqsg
Both my chem and our class latecoming,btohqsg
I also had problems coming to sch on time lmao,btohqsg
like taylor series generally is for x = a,btohqsg
I think we made her old,btohqsg
My chem cher alrd getting ppl to stay back üíÄ,btohqsg
Cuz tut not done for a while,btohqsg
Then they the 2 course work musketeers,btohqsg
It cant be as bad as my class,btohqsg
Idk what my class is like for submitting work,btohqsg
i am the school record holder for most number of hours slept in class,btohqsg
I dun actually know what is so difficult about completing homework,btohqsg
I only full on slept in class,btohqsg
i think the amount you slept in class is maybe how much i'm awake,btohqsg
Im the school‚Äôs record holder for number of sch event missed coz of (complete the sentence),btohqsg
Only econs they care coz my cher ask ppl stand at the back do their work if they dun do,btohqsg
I think lt5 is s3 right,btohqsg
But u cant do the same for math,btohqsg
My class is like they try to do,btohqsg
I remembered they make us do timed paper,btohqsg
U must be the teacher‚Äôs pet,btohqsg
I no comments on such people,btohqsg
I also play some afk games when brain legit not processing,btohqsg
Yea tbh i dun care about what others choose to do,btohqsg
There was this guy in my class a real genius,btohqsg
She alw play ml in lecture,btohqsg
But she just study btr by self study,btohqsg
It was p easy to top my class,btohqsg
I actually got number 5 in cohort for h2 econs w a B lmao,btohqsg
In mbt was a huge wow coz i got top 14 in chem 5th in econs and 1st in phy,btohqsg
chem is all about making an educated smoke,btohqsg
you see the data and then you smoke up some explanations to explain why the data is liddat,btohqsg
h2 chem is a shitty subject,btohqsg
dont bs with the bs himself,btohqsg
i still dunno what happened lmao,btohqsg
It is my highest scoring subject,btohqsg
But tbh the subject I spent most time with,btohqsg
well you're in pharm so makes sense,btohqsg
In my sch I think the top scorer (or if not within top 3) for h1 Econs prelims got C for a levels,btohqsg
fk the paper la i still hv nightmares that i got 30/75 or smth,btohqsg
results come back alr still nightmares,btohqsg
Then for my h2 Econs I got B even though I was within the top 15-20 for prelims,btohqsg
I considering retaking just econs only even though it won‚Äôt help with uni applications,btohqsg
I think not really worth to retake for the sake,btohqsg
I want to become an Econs tutor in the future and I feel like some phony/imposter if I can‚Äôt get A in the subject I want to teach,btohqsg
Nah it‚Äôs like I just can‚Äôt bring myself to teach the subject if I can‚Äôt even get the A myself lol,btohqsg
My cohort top in h2 econs is 80%,btohqsg
But like maybe I should scrap my plans to become an moe teacher,btohqsg
I enter the private sector first,btohqsg
people trust me to tutor them in H2 math despite my E for A levels,btohqsg
I wanted to but nie too far away,btohqsg
It‚Äôs harder to switch jobs from teaching to the private sector if I hate teaching,btohqsg
Ah it‚Äôs a good thing you didn‚Äôt go,btohqsg
me looking at my 0-20percentile chem in prelims,btohqsg
Some of my teachers entered the profession only in their 40s or even 50s,btohqsg
My useless gp tutor openly told the class ‚Äòi came to teaching out of no choice‚Äô,btohqsg
i‚Äôm gonna be at NTU for 8 years and the mrt there still won‚Äôt be complete,btohqsg
aye wtf if u go ntu,btohqsg
i may see u in ntu lol,btohqsg
haha idk i faster apply then go,btohqsg
if you take any math or physics mod there‚Äôs a non zero chance i TA,btohqsg
After then my impression of him went fr worse to worst,btohqsg
Yall should try treatsure it‚Äôs legit damn worth it,btohqsg
fk la uni accept me faster pls,btohqsg
Some hotel i went to I filled half my box with satay,btohqsg
I think YT will love it for bulking,btohqsg
Dinner lol I didn‚Äôt eat before that,btohqsg
It‚Äôs more than 1kg of food,btohqsg
this one... sadly i need to think ü§°Ô∏èÔ∏è,btohqsg
but im trying to avoid CS lol,btohqsg
Yeah but like this is like leftovers from 4/5 star hotels,btohqsg
The quality is very good for most of the stuff,btohqsg
Hv been melting the whole day,btohqsg
maybe you'll ta me if i go thr leh üíÄÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è,btohqsg
Nice but not everyday have NS events with buffet,btohqsg
At my unit only maybe 6-8 times a year got buffet I think,btohqsg
what are your possible options lmao as of now,btohqsg
Also right scdf booked the whole of USS for some event,btohqsg
They got extra tickets and I had to give away some for free lol,btohqsg
I remembered applying ntu for fun,btohqsg
eh actually nus im there at times too,btohqsg
I will say bye to nus in may,btohqsg
i basically hop between ntu nus every week,btohqsg
At my unit the free food is mostly low quality,btohqsg
Then got the food truck food poisoning incident,btohqsg
i rmbr SoC has this pastaexpress or smth lol i alw used to go eat it,btohqsg
Is that all from your unit,btohqsg
Damn that‚Äôs very good free food,btohqsg
If only my unit was like yours,btohqsg
lol ok they‚Äôre beginning to look obviously like stock photos,btohqsg
But at least that buffet you had looks better than my unit,btohqsg
My unit too poor to go restaurant,btohqsg
No la when i enlisted it was covid,btohqsg
i dont even feel like i got the benefit of that...,btohqsg
i still had to report 5 days a week,btohqsg
because apparently my mdm is very convinced my work is essential,btohqsg
i got see ppl wear before,btohqsg
then i curious like how you see from jt,btohqsg
GAH DAYUM NOT THE RUSTED STAPLER BULLET AND YELLOWISH PAPERS,btohqsg
I know for sure I'm not gonna get it,btohqsg
As someone who sucks in chem  fk u,btohqsg
Wtf is that part of a brisket,btohqsg
i tasted the salt water samples for my a level pracüòéüòé,btohqsg
1 mol dm^-3 NaCl(aq) insanely salty  even saltier than the ocean,btohqsg
geez he must be like me then,btohqsg
Get super high for p2 to pull up the practical mess,btohqsg
I remembered chem pract the last qns is free coz just memorizing work,btohqsg
But practical is more then theory,btohqsg
I wished they let us know our practical grades,btohqsg
I actually cant smoke anything besides GP,btohqsg
And i had a pretty much sleepless night yesterday,btohqsg
Was your GP tutor hired during the 2008 financial crisis,btohqsg
Apparently I heard moe went on a hiring spree to help combat the recession (ie. govt fiscal policy lol),btohqsg
So we had some rly unqualified teachers in that batch,btohqsg
Like nie lowered the requirements to all C I heard,btohqsg
Ya lor i tot moe got this role play shit in their assessment,btohqsg
Then 2015 there was a high supply of teachers and the requirements became AAA/A,btohqsg
Now the cop is still quite low but ur subject u wanna teach better be good la,btohqsg
Do you know what it is now?,btohqsg
I think it is BBB/C for my yr,btohqsg
But yeah that‚Äôs why if I teach econs I better make sure I get A,btohqsg
Like i mean when i was seeing when i applying uni (means that uas is the prev yr one),btohqsg
How to teach when u get C lmao,btohqsg
Idk sia but I heard of some teachers teaching a subject they got D for,btohqsg
Like honestly I doubt that if we made every single JC teacher sit for the subject they‚Äôre teaching they can get A,btohqsg
Got this tutor decides to take A levels,btohqsg
And encourage others to do the same,btohqsg
Fml my chances of being accepted is getting lower n lower as the time is getting by,btohqsg
Coz SKH is the only hosp in the NE region,btohqsg
If moe decides the grade boundaries based on the difficulty of the paper and not take into account the performance of the students then it‚Äôs all good,btohqsg
Is there even an educated smoking portion,btohqsg
But if there‚Äôs is a bellcurve of sorts or they take into account the performance then I would pissed about all the tutors who sit for the paper,btohqsg
Cos they‚Äôre making it harder for real students to get good grades,btohqsg
I dun think it is grade boundaries,btohqsg
Oh so that is where the tasting come into play,btohqsg
Im sure if ur theory is good  that is a given aso tho,btohqsg
But the real practical itself needs skills beyond theory knowledge,btohqsg
Moe said no bell curve but up till now I still don‚Äôt know in setting the grade threshold for each subject whether they only take into account the difficulty or whether they look at the performance after marking,btohqsg
Therefore  when the papers for a subject have been marked  a group of experts meets to decide how to convert the marks to grades. The experts look at marked papers from the current and previous years  then they decide what theminimum markfor each grade should be. If this year's papers are found to be slightly harder than last year's  then this year's grade boundaries will be slightly lower than last year's. Similarly  if this year's papers are found to be slightly easier  the grade boundaries will be slightly higher.,btohqsg
This implies that they don‚Äôt look at the cohort‚Äôs performance,btohqsg
Only judge it based on difficulty,btohqsg
Moe confirms also uses grade boundaries but we just don‚Äôt know the exact range for each subject and each year since it‚Äôs not disclosed,btohqsg
The more im puzzled w my grades,btohqsg
Uk a levels they will disclose after each exam,btohqsg
I think Cambridge give the grades no meh,btohqsg
The examiners give the raw marks,btohqsg
Seab decides on the standard for each grade,btohqsg
But sch exams only moderate the passing mark lmao,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt change the raw mark,btohqsg
They just adjust the mark needed to get each grade,btohqsg
In a sense it is similar to bell curve just that the marks ppl get doesn‚Äôt matter,btohqsg
Yeah only need to meet the grade threshold for a particular grade in order to get it,btohqsg
Unless they under/overest the difficulty of the paper,btohqsg
Similar but bellcurve takes into account percentile,btohqsg
And it is also weird to ask the examiner / setter to judge difficulty,btohqsg
Grade thresholds don‚Äôt so it‚Äôs better,btohqsg
Tbh I prefer a bell curve system,btohqsg
If everyone gets like 80-100 marks for an exam the person who got 80 would have been failed assuming moe designates like the bottom 5 percentile to fail,btohqsg
Grade thresholds if they set it before the paper is marked and only takes into account the difficulty then the distinction rate can vary quite a bit between years if the students in a particular year have better aptitude,btohqsg
I always think w bell curve  someone needs to fail,btohqsg
I still rather have grade thresholds since after all if bellcurve is used  the percentage of ppl getting a particular grade will be fixed unless moe alters it. But if moe needs to alter it because a batch of students is worse or better than usual  how do they decide how much to increase the percentage of failures/quality grades by? They still gonna have to see the students performance on each paper is and not arbitrarily decide a new percentage.,btohqsg
Well not every course has the luxury of past yr paper,btohqsg
I heard nus is like they will tell u how many As per module,btohqsg
But they wont tell u how much to get A,btohqsg
Or its the reverse i cant rmb,btohqsg
but ok for uni i agree on preferring bell curve ngl,btohqsg
like i feel that‚Äôs how i get my As and A+s,btohqsg
and it‚Äôs always from doing comparatively well in finals,btohqsg
but our studying methods are so different lol,btohqsg
i have never mugged in the sense people think of,btohqsg
almost feels like i smoked through uni,btohqsg
but idk if that‚Äôs imposter syndrome,btohqsg
im trying to clock 30h on ypt in march for ego,btohqsg
i mean i have nth to lose anyway,btohqsg
This has been going on for damn long alr,btohqsg
I cant sleep last night and now im just dozing off,btohqsg
And still hving problems with concentration,btohqsg
Then in the middle i will start cursing myself,btohqsg
But mods r allowing her to literally get the attention of these creeps,btohqsg
But ofc if u put ur pic up there yall gonna get more creeps in ur dms,btohqsg
But shes a minor so she dont unds,btohqsg
Bro hes still in this gc üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Shes inviting creeps in her dms yes,btohqsg
But mods are allowing her to invite these creeps,btohqsg
why isn't there a doxxing rule here,btohqsg
Like dont do it here in sgexams gc bruv,btohqsg
bro it's encouraging the gc to expose peoples names,btohqsg
It's encouraging her to continue inviting creeps into her dms,btohqsg
You projecting your insecurities on someone?,btohqsg
Shes obv doing it for compliments,btohqsg
I thought it meant great Singapore sale,btohqsg
But this behaviour shdnt be allowed,btohqsg
honestly if matcha wants to send then send lah. got creeps on her dm. can js block and report and alert the admins here,btohqsg
end of the day if someone wants to send selfies of themselves  it‚Äôs not against the rules and someone can‚Äôt just assume intentions,btohqsg
plus she‚Äôs 16 and above which isn‚Äôt a minor in sg,btohqsg
What else can her intention be by posing and talking a selfie,btohqsg
Displaying urself in a gc full of 20+ year olds,btohqsg
i mean i‚Äôm not saying i agree with it but as far as moderation goes,btohqsg
u don't like her to send selfies u can honestly js leave the grp,btohqsg
Hi my name is bartholomew lll,btohqsg
ok lemme put it this way. for all intents and purposes she‚Äôs able to decide for herself. her selfies aren‚Äôt rule breaking or an issue within itself but it‚Äôs just not advised la. if people are straight up creeping here then it‚Äôs separate matter. if people creep in dms then it‚Äôs on her,btohqsg
she‚Äôs old enough to decide her own safety online,btohqsg
Bruh all this for a selfie,btohqsg
@IcedMilohi irwen if the selfies arent allowed lmk and i'll delete them,btohqsg
Bro how we gonna recognise you lol üòÇ,btohqsg
Unless you‚Äôre like an influencer or smth I won‚Äôt be able to pick you out in public at all,btohqsg
omg i watched in pri sch,btohqsg
don't worry don't need selfie to get creeps in your DMs,btohqsg
most of the ppl who tell me got creep in their DM don't even have profile pic,btohqsg
im sure@aki923182appreciates your concern and I too appreciate your concern but as far as I'm concerned it doesn't break any rules,btohqsg
of course I do advice caution when sending anything that could expose your personal identity online but to each their own,btohqsg
my insta is damn public aso anw lel,btohqsg
thank youand yes i alr know the risks of sending selfies in a public gcbut as i have said  i treat this as any other social media - like instagram snapchat or tiktok. i understand that there is an inherent risk which comes with posting such selfies here,btohqsg
now what I don't understand is you choosing to make this assumption about my character. i feel like if you were truly concerned about my wellebing  you would dm me instead of making such comments in a public groupchat. did saying this make you feel morally superior?,btohqsg
i also watched  spirited away ponyo totoro,btohqsg
also as irwen said this   one can literally have default pic and creeps will still dm,btohqsg
Ik how kuro looks like but not me,btohqsg
I mean my pfp is anime girl also got creeps alrd,btohqsg
so you're implying that it's MY fault if i do get harassed ?,btohqsg
Me when someone asks me to hookup on instagram,btohqsg
my pfp is winnie the pooh someone asked me whether i wanted paid dates,btohqsg
my fren went to troll the person lol,btohqsg
"can i just say so many ""sugar mummy"" used to text me",btohqsg
u asking me if i want ah,btohqsg
but i want dual monitor arm,btohqsg
for single monitor abit meh honestly  for dual monitor or more makes more sense,btohqsg
depends on the space you have lor,btohqsg
i generally lean towards no if you have room,btohqsg
yk what i'll just delete everyting,btohqsg
he's literally implying that it's my fault if creeps dm me,btohqsg
my name can be both male and female so i get sugar mommies  prospective sugar babies and gss,btohqsg
They‚Äôre more likely to dm you if you‚Äôre posting selfies here  let alone having a pfp,btohqsg
ironically i‚Äôm at bukit batok now,btohqsg
üòé üòé üòé üòé üòé üòé üòé üòé,btohqsg

I went to drink with kron@IcedMilo,btohqsg
And he‚Äôs like how uk milo,btohqsg
who is kron and do i know him/her,btohqsg
bro said u were his sc senior,btohqsg
ok tbf i see that the person has good intentions,btohqsg
we at each other's living place lol,btohqsg
the only sc i know is standard chartered,btohqsg
but im really displeased with the tone of this message,btohqsg
Just insult me to my face  stop pretending to care about my wellbeing,btohqsg
they‚Äôve called me >5 times asking for more info in my credit card application,btohqsg
the simply cash one. i think it‚Äôs bc im on stipend so not just normal salary,btohqsg
then need this documentation from ntu,btohqsg
Lol this is an online gc üòÇ,btohqsg
People needa stop taking stuff online so seriously,btohqsg
because he doesnt actually care about whether or not i get creeps? he's just trying to push his assumptions onto me,btohqsg
nvr rly hear anyone w that cc ngl,btohqsg
i signed up for singsaver stuff lmao,btohqsg
free money + potentially free PS5 if i‚Äôm lucky,btohqsg
ok ah I think we're going too deep into the rabbit hole of can people send non-rule breaking stuff into the group based on our own personal beliefs so let's just chill on that topic and talk about smth else,btohqsg
tbh i‚Äôm quite stupid with navigating what‚Äôs a good cc,btohqsg
no point going deeper into that hole,btohqsg
if anyone has a problem with this gc letting people send non-rule breaking things u can let me know,btohqsg
depends on what your goal is i guess,btohqsg
i recently got into the miles game,btohqsg
so that's a bloody deep rabbit hole,btohqsg
Why can‚Äôt just dm him? That‚Äôs what started the problem anyways,btohqsg
tbh at first it was more of a sharing with the group thing like posting on social media,btohqsg
but then unexpectedly he started to like it alot,btohqsg
yea. what if she was js catfishing. im not saying she catfishing cuz ik she isnt. but whatif,btohqsg
Lol this is an online gc üòÇ,btohqsg
People needa stop taking stuff online so seriously,btohqsg
yea what if im actl a 60 year old shu shu and the girl in the pic is my dotter,btohqsg
credit card points trf to krisflyer,btohqsg
then why you send your daughter to meet me irl,btohqsg
how much you gotta spend for a flight,btohqsg
tbh hor u gna spend the money alr  with the correct card u can earn like >5% back in miles,btohqsg
Yeah  I just assume everyone on the Internet is a guy unless ik her irl,btohqsg
compared to like 1-2% for general cashback cards,btohqsg
but yea i actl did expect someone to be unhappy with the selfies,btohqsg
oh not bad if i spend like 1k that‚Äôs $50 a month alr,btohqsg
like isnt unexpected that the person sent that tbh,btohqsg
why unhappy when someone posts a selfie,btohqsg
if i post a selfie of kuro would he be unhappy,btohqsg
that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre supposed to do dipshit,btohqsg
well yk where i am so,btohqsg
yea it's q good imo so like if u use smth like citi rewards  u spend 1k a month  u get 4 mpd  so that's 4k miles.a return trip to jakarta from 1june-30june is 17k miles + $88 tax  and that will cost you $4.25k in regular spending with a 4mpd carda regular ticket for the same period is at least $498.10 (with less perks).so effectively u spent $4.25k to get $500 back  which is like >10% cashback,btohqsg
whr u gna get 10% cashback on a regular cc,btohqsg
can i still send meal pics,btohqsg
or creeps also attracted to rice,btohqsg
Do you wanna DIE that badly irl,btohqsg
I will not repeat wtv I've said in the dms,btohqsg
damn spending for ~4 months pays for my flights,btohqsg
tbh idk why i didn‚Äôt consider this earlier when i wanna solo travel,btohqsg
we hv like 8 cats here,btohqsg
UOB lady's card gets u 6mpd if u can optimise it,btohqsg
LOL yea cause username changed but pfp same,btohqsg
You sure it didn't ran away,btohqsg
funny thing is point redemption flights get more perks than an economy lite ticket,btohqsg
I'm sure you forced it to take a pic w u,btohqsg
that lowkey looks like somerset 7-11,btohqsg

that's just social media for the most part üòÅ,btohqsg
but usually people ignore that fact,btohqsg
okay nvm I also have LinkedIn,btohqsg
I‚Äôm shocked at how I can scroll through 40 second videos for hours lol,btohqsg
reasons why im not on tiktok,btohqsg
üò≠ üò≠ üò≠ üò≠ üò≠ üò≠,btohqsg
ig actually. Just downloaded a week ago,btohqsg
But bef that I always used desktop,btohqsg
tiktok abit too much for me,btohqsg
i refuse to watch any reels on ig LOL,btohqsg
the longest duration i had downloaded ig for was for a few weeks,btohqsg
used it only for like 10sec,btohqsg
üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
after using ig for a week my attention span is shorter than my reaction time,btohqsg
well not only does sex not exist for me i only last a second on bed so that's not wrong,btohqsg
reels sometimes got some food stuff,btohqsg
when doing a conclusion for a research presentation you include both primary and secondary research?,btohqsg
also what if dam hard to derive a logical conclusion from ur own data,btohqsg
after a job interview  my attention span is worst than ever in my past 2x years,btohqsg
its for a outside research project competition thing,btohqsg
i itchy hand want do everything,btohqsg
basically im graduating this year and i need a hospital job for training to get my licensure (and the first round of interviews is yesterday + today),btohqsg
i wonder why is it still the best rated uni in singapore and among the top in asia,btohqsg
tbh as a nus student  i dun agree to that at all,btohqsg
because ntu is probably worse than nus,btohqsg
im pretty sure future rounds it can only be tougher to cope...coz it is already week 7 of 13,btohqsg
hmmm questionable  with 1 in 3 nus students suffering from mental health issue  they seriously openly announce that hmmm,btohqsg
i think NUS higher than china,btohqsg
yes that is the top but i think NUS is 5th or 4th iirc,btohqsg
no the top 2 is peking and some japan uni i think,btohqsg
"""we openly announce because this stat is better than NTU"" - NUS  probably",btohqsg
depends on what metric aso la,btohqsg
also uni rankings are slightly rigged,btohqsg
nus dun deserve the top spot tbh,btohqsg
but i cant comment more coz i dunno what is ntu like,btohqsg
we all shit on our own unis ngl,btohqsg
ok not technically top in asia but top in SEA,btohqsg
if im gonna fail my exam coz of trying to get a job,btohqsg
does gpa matter in pharmacy actually,btohqsg
yea we are not medicine and dentistry,btohqsg
it is largely pass / fail,btohqsg
so dunnid to worry about job,btohqsg
thank you for carrying the future of the singapore healthcare system,btohqsg
my mum be like 'that is the motivation to join medicine',btohqsg
but sadly  doctors get full credit,btohqsg
tbh i didnt want medicine for various reasons so it is partly my fault,btohqsg
but tbh i dun have a portfolio to stand a chance lmao,btohqsg
can I just say everytime i go polyclinic the docs just sit thr talk and type then the pharmacists downstairs all running around and desperately trying to explain weird medicine prescriptions to people who can't understand basic english,btohqsg
my friend got rejected fr med with 87.5,btohqsg
exactly  some people dun even understand why they need wait for their medicines lmao,btohqsg
would they wait or get the wrong medicines urgh,btohqsg
eh i wait for medicine damn fast tho isit cause mine just paracetamol/some rando cough meds,btohqsg
i think the stressful education system plays a part in this,btohqsg

wait long: complainget it fast then kena fuck by wrong medicine: complain,btohqsg
but i heard polyclinic goes by queue system,btohqsg
i cant remember if it is chronological,btohqsg
coz most of the meds is full of chronic medicines,btohqsg
coz i did minor pick n pack at polyclinic before,btohqsg
I didnt click into this chat to have my heart hurt like that,btohqsg
majority of the people serving u at polyclinic are pharm techs,btohqsg
the pharmacists at polyclinic only do p-sales / behind the scenes doing stuff on the computer / intervene through wrong prescriptions,btohqsg
im kinda despo for a hospital places,btohqsg
it is just affecting my concentration right now lmao,btohqsg
im 7 weeks behind on school so,btohqsg
in pharm if i dun study i will submit a blank paper:-(,btohqsg
this sem like they test y1-4 knowledge,btohqsg
but isnt ntu mid terms like now,btohqsg
so recess week is 1 day catch up 1 week,btohqsg
wait i tot now is recess week,btohqsg
me too with my 3 core mid terms,btohqsg
si yan probably knows my ass is failing,btohqsg
i think NUS is a week early?,btohqsg
i hv 2 core 2 elect midterms,btohqsg
but i gave up on cs im sorry siyan / lestin / wyatt,btohqsg
thank you  good luck to u too,btohqsg
but i cant let stress get the better of me coz i hv been hving stress headache more often,btohqsg
and omg when i enter uni right  somehow all the stress GI symptom / headache start coming before an exam,btohqsg
Andrea do you recommend doing pharm,btohqsg
so i pop nurofen as preventive lmao,btohqsg
YK i only recently realised there's a dual nurofen paracetamol pill,btohqsg
like 2nd major in pharm sci,btohqsg
i dont even call it stress eating anymore,btohqsg
double major is not really allowed in pharmacy,btohqsg
coz i think the curriculum is too intense for someone to handle that and usually people use their UEs as cross map to fulfill their major,btohqsg
but in pharmacy there is only 12 modular credits of MCs,btohqsg
Damn ok  do you guys make the pharmaceuticals? I‚Äôve never really looked into life sci majors cuz I only took physics lol,btohqsg
i think it depends on your true passion? if u are passionate about serving patients etc then go for it! But just be prepared that actually the demands of both the UG curriculum + the actual work is quite hectic (im gonna be honest  not gonna sugarcoat anything),btohqsg
but the pharmacy curriculum is not under CHS (it is on its own like bachelor of pharmacy)  and prepares u for pre-registration training post graduation (recently there is some curriculum structure change  hopefully during ur batch time it will be better organized lmao)...,btohqsg
i feel that some people loss their passion midway due to the intensity:-(,btohqsg
wait ur house key or what,btohqsg
i went out of my house without my wallet before,btohqsg
and i was alr late for school,btohqsg
but the sun is really crazy give me headache,btohqsg
i dun use cash at all so i bring a big ass wallet just for 2 cards that i need,btohqsg
im considering life sci/bio related degree then pgde,btohqsg
pharma is interesting but its not really recognised by nie so rah,btohqsg
prob pgde in case i suddenly dw teach anymore,btohqsg
cause if go nie ntu then difficult to pivot,btohqsg
do not be a teacher sorry to all teachers here,btohqsg
my og never goes out for lunch but they always find the wrong time to video call on wa,btohqsg
Don't be ruining the one career path i thought about since sec school :((,btohqsg
nobody wants to teach in a class full of rowdy kids üò≠,btohqsg
hahahaha if u rly want to then bless your soul,btohqsg
If NIE doesnt accept my low af gpa then i guess its a blessing in disguise,btohqsg
all my family friends with kids all say,btohqsg
they wld rather send their kids to NUS/NTU than tsinghua or peking,btohqsg
no way my parents want me to go tsinghua,btohqsg
cause tsinghua and peking don't provide education with a global perspective,btohqsg
you're stuck with the China & CCP mindset,btohqsg
that doesn't earn you money in the long term,btohqsg
everyone who's capable are diversifying away from china and that includes their kids,btohqsg
Sry exchange is not in the vocabulary of a pharmacy ug,btohqsg
Oh yea  if u planning on that  then i dun recommend pharm  like it is not worth it + it is a very specialised course,btohqsg
is biz less specialised in a sense,btohqsg
I nearly went to nie  wanted to teach econs / math but nie too far for me so here im suffering,btohqsg
tbh im not very sure also whether i prefer molecular bio or zoology,btohqsg
all ik is i dont like physiology,btohqsg
Biz is very broad  im not sure but i think ppl get to specialize sort of in y2/3 (?),btohqsg
biz so broad what u want to do specifically,btohqsg
My parents have been advicing me AGAINST it,btohqsg
cause they dk what they want to do,btohqsg
ok biz is like you need to know what you get out of it,btohqsg
they want to be a banking snake,btohqsg
bc real talk the actual content taught in a biz degree is gonna be near useless,btohqsg
Very true‚Ä¶like what now poly has this course called ‚Äòcommon business‚Äô,btohqsg
tbh i feel like alevel syllabus is not very academically rigorous,btohqsg
alot of things can smoke tbh,btohqsg
depends on your definition of rigour,btohqsg
or maybe im high on drugs,btohqsg
Ok not that i remember how my grades came about in jc,btohqsg
actl i think thats the likelier option,btohqsg
But actually i mugged my way,btohqsg
i can only speak about the science aspect but a lot of the smoking and just whack to score comes from not knowing enough,btohqsg
basically we‚Äôre too dumb at that point,btohqsg
And for someone to mug her way to A  means it is not rigorous in a sense,btohqsg
NUS/NTU cheaper for an intl china student compared to tsinghua/peking as a local?,btohqsg
lets say ur shitty at math,btohqsg
you can mug ur way to A if you spam tys,btohqsg
but then some stuff is cannot mug,btohqsg
