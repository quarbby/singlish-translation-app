Here are two translated Gaokao Geog qns  let's see how many get this right:The Bering Strait is 80km wide in a highly strategic location. Because of this  there have been proposals to build a tunnel or a bridge across it. The following questions are based on these proposals:Q1. The construction of the Bering Strait bridge or the undersea tunnel will be conducive to (...)1. greatly shortening shipping times between the Asian and American continents  thus furthering trade between the two continents.2. promoting the growth of the Pacific Rim Economic Belt3. Enhancement of material and resource flows between the U.S.  Russia  and Canada  and the export of U.S. and Canadian sources to Russia.4. Promoting economic development in the Russian Far East and the U.S. state of AlaskaOptions:A. 1 2  and 3B. 1  3 and 4C. 2  3 and 4D. 1  2 and 4Q2. What is the main reason such a bridge or tunnel cannot be built currently?A. Technology has not yet matured enoughB. Infrastructure on both ends (e.g. roads) cannot yet support such a crossingC. Conflict between the US and RussiaD.  Scarcity of population and labor force,btohqsg
Me when I have to ask my parents to sign my report book with shitty P3 results.,btohqsg
Q2) B due to all the other factors' involvement ( national conflicts  technology disadvantageousness  lack of labor forces ),btohqsg
Both answers are wrong  the correct answer is D for 1 and B for 2,btohqsg
your answer for 2 is right,btohqsg
trick questions in the gaokao be like,btohqsg
i mean.... it's part of the reasons,btohqsg
if i actually took this gaokao geography paper  i'd probably just get an eraser and write A B C D or 1 2 3 4 on each side of it before sneakily throwing the eraser dice to the questions i face self-doubt  getting stumped over,btohqsg
if it's not obvious  im more of a creative linguistics person,btohqsg
i think a lot of people want to know more about that,btohqsg
wtf how come my thought process works better in gaokao,btohqsg
i got multiple Bs and Cs for N(T) exams and flunked my NA exams entirely,btohqsg
do you remember studying Bering Straits in geography,btohqsg
Combined Elective Geography did not have this topic,btohqsg
