Can I ask if anyone can advise on what are the potential tradeoffs between getting a DSB Altitude Amex vs Visa card? Cos‚Äô there is a differential in the awarded bonus miles.,btohqsg

Hi Guys and ladies. I don't mind sharing this . I just google and found this.. in the benefits of doubt . I think through about 5 mins .. I think is worth while let the bank transfer for you monthly the 10k miles to kris flyer... while you enrol for the programme and pay a 1 time annual fee of $50,btohqsg
10k miles? This is kinda a lockup that you can only convert to KF miles. What if I dowan to take SQ?Feels like this is only applicable to people with high spending that is able to hit the min uni$ of 15k for conversion of more than 2 times to make it worthwhile,btohqsg
Sorry . Typing error. Is 5k miles each time,btohqsg
Why need to auto convert  the expiry is faster and u miss conversion promotion (although rare),btohqsg
This one you tell him don‚Äôt tell me,btohqsg
This‚Ä¶ no good‚Ä¶.You know UOB can transfer for free right?Free one better  why pay?,btohqsg

Err  it is a lounge. Not sure what to say.You can see the lounge provided at the point of booking  it differs based on terminal,btohqsg
