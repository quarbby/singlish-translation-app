I was actually wondering sth .... how come there is no one attempting to manipulate sports competition for their own benefits?,btohqsg
A classic example will be ppl manipulating soccer match to win football bets... what's stopping them from doing so uh ?,btohqsg
But how to prove that a match is manipulated anyway ?,btohqsg
Release of deepseek is making many companies scrambling to self host.,btohqsg
Meaning higher purchase of GPU/CPU and ram,btohqsg
geostationary satellites wouldnt move tho right?,btohqsg
GEO is extremely far away  cannot see,btohqsg
That one need someone with better knowledge in orbital mechanics to explain 😂😳😅 I dun do physics for too long,btohqsg
ISS so big already and is in LEO. Naked eye is one tiny dot in the sky,btohqsg
Technically they dont move from our perspective because they orbit at the same speed as earth's rotation,btohqsg
Bruhh..I just finish watching the new marvel movies...eek,btohqsg
Oh well  some ppl say satellite quite predictable somehow as they follow gravitational physics laws 😅😅,btohqsg
There has been cases where satellite signals are disrupted by degradation either intentionally or otherwise,btohqsg
That why certain military invest loads money in developing spy planes   avoiding the probability signals from satellite gets jammed somehow,btohqsg
satellites unless very near cannot see from earth,btohqsg
like ISS v near and is barely bright enough to appear as a star,btohqsg
but even then v difficult to see with naked eye,btohqsg
geostationary satellites are so far need telescope to just see a small speck of it,btohqsg
Just download sky map on your phone should be Mars in there,btohqsg
This time if I come up with stats materials for a level use   I will have to do a test run first before it gets to reddit 😂😂😂 coz my previous attempt of producing jc/Poly materials as one prove to be problematic,btohqsg
Wait how come gt Russian bots ? 😅😅,btohqsg
"Having Russian gf may be a strange experience though ...  I was learning Russian from native speaker online and managed to get the grammar behind ""я люблю тебя"" (which means ""I love you"" in Russian) 😂😂👍",btohqsg

ohh yep thats what i meant like we wldnt see them move,btohqsg
yea it was down for awhile,btohqsg
oh btw  anyone know where to buy AAAA battery?,btohqsg
H2 Mathematics - Use of Graphing Calculator TI84.pdf,btohqsg
people now use TI84 Plus CE,btohqsg
Yea I feel like this focuses on probability and stats portions  which is good,btohqsg
Esp the simultaneous eqns finder and roots of a solution finder,btohqsg
Trying to rewrite stats materials with support for gc operations,btohqsg
If good I hope it ends up on holy grail somehow,btohqsg
Instructions quite similar I think ... I fired up a Web emulator,btohqsg
For ti84 plus CE edition   nothing changed with regards to 2nd key and vars to get to the distribution functionality,btohqsg
