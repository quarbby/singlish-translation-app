Can i check any review on instant momentum?,btohqsg
Im gonna try to do it tmr but lazee.. need to scold gf to not get her to cheat,btohqsg
It looks scammy scummy and clearly a scam,btohqsg
Moomoo didn’t honour sign up bonus. I don’t trust them,btohqsg
Even the medium article about it (a simple google search) looks scammish - too much stock photos,btohqsg
The articles are clearly ai generated... Poorly generated likely from gpt3,btohqsg
What about webull money fund? Better there?,btohqsg
so far the rewards were given for the Oct 2023I reduce to 5k sgd thou after the rewards in.put in Syfe for 3 months.,btohqsg
Might move to webull bah moomoo steals too much haha,btohqsg
I plan to transfer from Moomoo to webull. Webull also have MMF that gain daily interest?Is it better than moomoo  so far moomoo have been good for me,btohqsg
I did not calculate  u mean the amount given not correct? So u add up the daily and plus the additional they give  yet still fall short of 5.8%?,btohqsg
Yes. Still Fall short of 5.8% after 2nd appeal.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/170908,btohqsg
I also only received 42cents only for Moomoo 5.8%.  Their investigation is still on.  Will call and scold next week if not resolved 😜,btohqsg
can anyone enlighten if we open the Bonus Saver Account on 28 or 29 Feb 2024  but deposit the fresh fund on 1st or 2nd week of March 2024  would we still eligible for the CNY Promo Cashbank?,btohqsg
The tnc clearly states when the promo ends. As long everything is done within the promo period  you're eligible.,btohqsg
I just booked 250$ flight fromtrip.com. but my uob  gave me just 50uni$ :( 😞I used uob lady's card travel category. I wonder why 🤔,btohqsg
Will spend on Agoda etc. count as overseas spend?,btohqsg
Jialat  I never track my 5.8% and assumed correct. And was doing more than 1 promo  difficult to track back.Both me and spouse got $230-$240 for the 5.8% coupon.I m doing the 6.8% now  this time I must track closely the returns and coupon value 😅,btohqsg
Anyone use sc ezbill pay Aia insurance? After more than a week  I realised from Aia website  it’s not paid 😌Transaction is posted in SCB ibanking,btohqsg

I recently signed up for hsbc revo + ega thru the SingSaver  based on experience how long yall get the promo reward? (Ipad/cash),btohqsg
How much the cash coupon you got in Dec/Jan? How much you subscribed?,btohqsg
They will send you an invoice to say you've paid,btohqsg
Bonus point in next month lah. 50 is the base 1x uni,btohqsg
Around 4-5 monthsLast year around same time on Jan register only got it during May June iirc,btohqsg
Another -1#dpfor moomoo. Probably the most dishonest of the cn brokers.Apparently if you redeem your fund before 9am on the day after a non-trading day  they’ll just take your interest,btohqsg
What da fak  bro this is like talking to a wall,btohqsg
I wonder is it same practice for Poems and Webull ?,btohqsg
Your coupon looks ok to me. My calculation also shows that I shall get $230++ cash coupon  but I get none before I asked for investigation.,btohqsg
Ar so subscribe 80k get 230$ cash coupon is about there?,btohqsg
Yup. For me it was short of 5.8% after adding the daily interest and cash coupon together,btohqsg
For my case  yes. $230++ is norm.But my return is only 3.97% before I request for investigation.,btohqsg
there will be opportunity cost due to those days before and after subscription which are not earning interest,btohqsg
That’s very disgusting and I’m sure they didn’t explicit state this anywhere until u asked them. I don’t even think that’s legally right.If they don’t want to give u the 3 days interest  you should have got your principal for value before the non working days.,btohqsg
Yes which is why I always like to say don’t compare the published rates of Mmf vs fixed deposit or savings account.There is always slippage for mmfs.,btohqsg
Is it Bec subscription and redemption is not immediate  so lose 1-2days at start and at end… ?,btohqsg
Yeah  I can't find any mention of it anywhere  and not a peep from them until I follow up. Makes me wonder how much of the customer base is being kept in the dark about this dishonest behavior. no different to stealing.,btohqsg
Yes to this also. And also the way they start interest accrualsTLDR: mmf and fixed deposit/ savings account yields are not exactly comparable. Not to mention credit risk also.,btohqsg
Of course AIA. They're the billing org.,btohqsg
Unfortunately their call Center is not open on weekends,btohqsg
Perhaps you want to check when you deposited the fund previously  did you get the interest next day before your fund actually subscribed to MMF 2-4 days later?,btohqsg
I never check my moomoo mmf  because I keep add/withdraw  so it’s hard,btohqsg
"The document should appear on My AIA SG app anyway  no need to call to check.Usually takes 5-7 working days after they posted.Based on ""more than a week""  I'm assuming the payment was posted before 6 Feb?",btohqsg
This should be more than 5-7 working days till now,btohqsg
Does that mean you cannot get 5.8% Because you have withdrawal? Is there a TnC that if have withdrawal  no 5.8%?,btohqsg
"I ""think"" I still get 5.8% because I received $165 coupon after 2-3 days",btohqsg
Does UOB lady travel category work on in Japan bus/ mrt travels? Like buying Shinkansen from the counter or top up money in suica card ?,btohqsg
