Im interested in it and i score well for it,btohqsg
KI is just a different thing,btohqsg
Yeah ik la but got the chance to crack the pun uküò≠,btohqsg
GP is grounded on worldly workings,btohqsg
So GP is like more practical but ki is more theory,btohqsg
is there a min height requirement to drive bcz pocoyo is mad short,btohqsg
Like gp qn wld be how does democracy affect ur countries policy making,btohqsg
KI wld be like what is a chair,btohqsg

may need some seat adjustments or not so big cars but is can,btohqsg
dw let it grow out for 2 wks,btohqsg
Can adjust the seat lower & fwd,btohqsg
guys did you guys learn about matrices first or linear transformation first,btohqsg
cos iirc initially it‚Äôs just introduced as a way to concisely express a set of values,btohqsg
ok bc i think they should hv taught linear transformation first,btohqsg
perhaps. i mean the matrices thats learned just teaches the rules of matrices,btohqsg
but like you‚Äôd need some idea of vector spaces etc whereas matrices to express values are quite simple,btohqsg
yeah which forces student to memorise which is what idl about the syllabus,btohqsg
uhh what are you memorising? i‚Äôve been out of that for a long time,btohqsg
19 day confinement is what sia,btohqsg
as in you would have to memorise the rules of matrices without understanding why first,btohqsg
the 2x2 matrix multiplication for example,btohqsg
i find that the case for most o and a levels anyway tho,btohqsg
how the row elements matches the column element,btohqsg
Guys sorry to disturbBut for like O level result do the teacher tell you your result like when sitting down in the table?,btohqsg
if they cared to explain it in linear transformation term it would be the landing coord of the i hat j hat would multiply by the coord of starting vector,btohqsg
you just proved my point üíÄ,btohqsg
Or like we have a choice to not see/know the results until we go home,btohqsg
that you think the matrix multiplication rule is a definition‚Ä¶,btohqsg
i mean it is a definition and it‚Äôs a definition derived from expressing the transformations naturally,btohqsg
but it is still just a way of writing it,btohqsg
i think it‚Äôs still ok to teach them this rule without knowing linear transformations,btohqsg
later your a level results also envelope send to tekong...,btohqsg
then your outfield letter becomes A level cert,btohqsg
Best day to enlist is saturday,btohqsg
Im not even taking olevel this year,btohqsg
just the curiosity lol bc im supposed to do the determinant side of matrices now but if i want to understand determinant i would have to understand linear transformation to understand itüòêüòê,btohqsg
normally i agree that the syllabus doesn‚Äôt cover things properly and simply teaches to follow the method,btohqsg
but linear transformations is one of those things that i think it‚Äôs pretty difficult to fit in,btohqsg
i mean if you wanna teach linear transformations  you can‚Äôt just stop at matrices. it‚Äôs like all the background understanding of vector spaces to learn this one rule,btohqsg
but for the sec sch students it‚Äôs fine to use it as a tool to express a set of  values,btohqsg
That reminds me that there's this really good series by 3blue1brown on linear algebra,btohqsg
yea i watched it back when i was learning it,btohqsg
i used his videos to study for my entire sem in 2 nights,btohqsg
This series singlehandedly saved my math,btohqsg
is it the first time I see them,btohqsg
hi do anyone have the answer booklet for 2020 june o level paper ? if there is  can send the answer key over,btohqsg
wait tm 1 is what time,btohqsg
oh god idw see nanocar driver tmr,btohqsg
why y'all trynna do some pocoyo x nanocar driver collab,btohqsg
I'd rather have a pocoyo x siyan,btohqsg
all i rmb is a Protein called Pikachurin,btohqsg
Lmao i thought it was this too,btohqsg
that'll be me inside not bedok bvz I too short for a normal car,btohqsg
i'm staying up the entire night,btohqsg
I only did that when I was in year 1 for lab report üò≠üôà,btohqsg
scored 9.5/10my friend then took and copy my work  and fixed the mistake  and he got 10/10. üòí,btohqsg
i camped at the faculty building before,btohqsg
I camped at another NS mate's bunk,btohqsg
cos can just submit to the prof under his door,btohqsg
I mean his room. Bunk for NS.,btohqsg
it was quite dumb. 9am to 12 was lab  then my lessons till 8pm.Then next time need submit by 12  but next day lessons start at 8am  2 consecutive lectures till 12.,btohqsg
i'm crashing my gf's room rn,btohqsg
and I still have to have my 1 hour swim after lab work. Cannot let the misc fees go to waste üòÇ,btohqsg
because I took 3rd language  and to ensure no schedule clash  I chose a 6pm to 8pm class,btohqsg
and also because I nothing better to do  take extra modules for 4 consecutive semesters in the first 2 years,btohqsg
So I ended up taking 181 credits worth of modules when the requirement was 161.I figured that learning more stuff for the same amount of $$ and time was good,btohqsg
Unis like SIM charge by number of modules taken. Not sure if that's still the case,btohqsg
I didn't bother because I got a scholarship  let it pay,btohqsg
so take the opportunity to experience everything. Went for student exchange  and went for internship,btohqsg
that time lucky. No covid  no terrorist  no recession yet,btohqsg
all guaranteed spots became not guaranteed in 2020,btohqsg
Quite a few of the places I visited were either bombed or burnt üò≠,btohqsg
I still have souvenir from there,btohqsg
could i ask u kind souls a qn,btohqsg
do yall think bald ppl wear hairnets at fnb operations?,btohqsg
like if theyre working for fnb,btohqsg
iw to slp y am I awake,btohqsg
Good luck for O Level results!!,btohqsg
yeah bruh everyone is so stressed,btohqsg
i redownloaded telegram just for this HAHAHA,btohqsg
No stress. 10 years later  it doesn't matter,btohqsg
eh loyang View has always had a bad reputation,btohqsg
Js wondering  what's the average age to get married now.. back then it was 25/27.. but look what's siyan doing now still studying,btohqsg
ya that's the correct guy now,btohqsg
I mean this one same for my parents also,btohqsg
for me it was 31 years old,btohqsg
BTO takes 5 to 6 years nowadays,btohqsg
i mean i'm also not a good reference cos most people don't study all the way to a PhD  which is not only a huge time sink but also a financial constraint,btohqsg
two of my close friends my age already BTOed last year,btohqsg
which due to how long it takes would lead to the marrying age being 27 and above if you wanna wait for it,btohqsg
the ones that married earlier for me usually had a lot of support financially initially,btohqsg
after getting  need to wait 5 years to build,btohqsg
back den people 30 alr have second kid haha,btohqsg
My previous boss 30+ got second kid also,btohqsg
kuro I whack u one time den yk,btohqsg
Shoot inside can alr  15 yo also can be mummy,btohqsg
My cousin getting married this year at 28  pretty sure his gf from rich fam,btohqsg
On the other hand my sis getting married this year also at 39,btohqsg
In fact I quite surprised she would want to settle down,btohqsg
The gf can immediately go overseas study after poly,btohqsg
Then shortly after my cousin ask me if I started btoing already which is impossible coz I'm studying,btohqsg
ok this one all of us also cmi ya,btohqsg
how does one get that rich other than business,btohqsg
This one faster shoot inside seal the deal,btohqsg
ok nvm that one haram alr,btohqsg
She say she haven't found the right one  then after that say her ba zi is of someone who will never settle down,btohqsg
Then suddenly ask me when I getting married coz dw clash,btohqsg
i‚Äôm planning to get married at like 32,btohqsg
that‚Äôs the general timeline i have rn,btohqsg
very early advance haha but yes thank you,btohqsg
I only gonna marry once I confirm bto and months before collecting key,btohqsg
Coz to me now it's like just a law requirement,btohqsg
i‚Äôm planning to bto in 2 years or so,btohqsg
then 32 is 5 years from then,btohqsg
I'd rather they don't invite me to book any flat coz confirm no one want,btohqsg
meanwhile my friend first try get recently,btohqsg
Depends on popularity of the project  but I think even if get going to be super low floor,btohqsg
If non matured got priority I think,btohqsg

I have a feeling got leh,btohqsg
then uni is the locked stage üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
whether u can go in is another problem,btohqsg
i mean if you ask different people it's usually quite module dependent,btohqsg
for some it's a little more of just moderation,btohqsg
how did u even get this statistics lol,btohqsg
at least for the poly students in my uni course,btohqsg
if u study hard and do well u will be fine,btohqsg
doesnt matter to me lol  theoretically 100% of the whole course in poly can go Uni since poly mods arent bell curved,btohqsg
they can‚Äôt expect us to walk,btohqsg
i mean like that that's the kinda job i'd take tbh,btohqsg
4am is my sleeping time anyway,btohqsg
except today i slept 1130am to 1230pm,btohqsg

you know a lot of people self learn piano,btohqsg
there's so much shit you can't self learn,btohqsg
or it takes way more effort,btohqsg
if you can't read scores  then you're alr stuck quite early,btohqsg
