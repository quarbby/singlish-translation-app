2021 is coming to an end. And this means  if you have some Grabpay wallet spending allowance left  there is some last minute opportunity for you to cash out your Grabpay credits.1) Sign up for Bigpay Apphttp://bigpay.link/referralsand use my promo code KJN6MN5GS0 to get $10 Sign-up bonus.2) Top up to Bigpay VISA card using your Grabpay wallet3) Use your Bigpay VISA debit card to top-up your Grabpay4) Withdraw from Grabpay wallet. Free withdrawal since Bigpay is considered a debit card5) In short Grabpay -> Bigpay -> Grabpay Withdrawal*Exclusive to Telegram members only.

Hi all  anyone knows how to DCA into crypto? I'm wondering whether there's some crypto ETF that includes a bunch of crypto currencies so that I don't need to care which coins to buy,btohqsg
No spot etf for crypto. I would suggest you research on what cryptos you like. Then set up recurring buy via CDC (Crypto dot com). Since no fees and easy onboarding,btohqsg
ðŸ¤£ that's too bad... but thanks for your suggestion,btohqsg
