I see.. haha at 1st thought was a scam or something lol..,btohqsg
Why selling your car in Singapore is an annoying experienceHow difficult can selling your car in Singapore be? It's just a simple exchange of cash for car right? Let's find out just how frustrating it can be.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Find out why..,btohqsg
Hello  for used car  normally will the dealer ask u to put some deposit before agreeing to send the car for inspection? How is the procedure like? Thanks,btohqsg
If got the VR6 Lagi rare,btohqsg
Some yes some no. If yes  just put bare minimum will do and better state the conditions clearly.Some will say it’s just minor wear and tear  so you have to buy the car otherwise deposit forfeited.,btohqsg
If the results are acceptable  am I obliged to buy the car?,btohqsg
If you interested enough to send for an inspection  and there’s minimal issues,btohqsg
What’s stopping you from buying it?,btohqsg
Is inspection usually the last step? E.g. should we discuss the financial and stuff before or after the inspection?,btohqsg
if you want to nego price  of course you do it before sending for inspection,btohqsg
So once I am ok with the price  I send for inspection. If inspection results are not as expected  I can get back deposit (if any) or I can nego for even lower price  right?,btohqsg
Hello  just received LTA notification on OBU installation.Is it better to go vicom or back to car agent to do the replacement.,btohqsg
Deposit then can PPIConditions1) no major accident2) no engine or gb failure3) usually i will add if odo tamper deposit refund3rd condition see dealer okay to accept,btohqsg
If dealer dont let u PPI u can walk away,btohqsg
I'm going to Car Specialist and Platinum Motoring. Anyone has any comment on them? Thanks,btohqsg
Oh I dunno yet. Haven't ask,btohqsg
Isn't the ppi charge by the inspection companies like vicom and sta?,btohqsg
If me I just test drive n floor gas then check leaks,btohqsg
Hmm...why so specific on this? Cn7 is known to leak or?,btohqsg
Hmm I think u ppi better,btohqsg
Ppi how much u can accept?,btohqsg
100+ i think u can get a mechanic take mc n spend whole day check for u. they earn much less than 100+ a day,btohqsg
Oh it is evaluation  and not inspection?,btohqsg
Wow 226 can get 2 mechanics take mc check 8 hours for u lol,btohqsg
Haha..is it inspection or evaluation ah? Sta inspection is less than 100  Evaluation is 200 plus,btohqsg
Inspection is just for u to renew road tax,btohqsg
Evaluation / PPI just bring to your own trusted workshop,btohqsg
I don't have one..so probably gonna send to sta or vicom.,btohqsg
think better u ask around friends / family who drive for a trusted workshop,btohqsg
no need to be hyundai specialist or what  any bread n butter car workshop will do,btohqsg
Because it's cheaper and probably better than going to vicom or sta is it?,btohqsg
Heard some say vicom/sta nt so good. Own workshop more impartial. But alot of dealer don agree with personal ws. Only sta/vicom,btohqsg
Cos u go vicom / sta  if PPI no good  u will end up need go workshop to rectify issues anyway be it by dealer workshop or own,btohqsg
U add extra step that is not so efficient lol,btohqsg
Nt sure how true of the rumour i heard. Sta/vicom have good relationship with dealers so will tend to lean towards them?,btohqsg
Thanks all..managed to find a hood friend workshop,btohqsg
I PPI at my own workshops,btohqsg
Or go to a ws that specialise in the model or make of the cR,btohqsg
U looking at a CN7? PPI properly tiagong CN7 from prev models not as reliable but i would say its okay,btohqsg
Got it bro.. my friend intro me his trusted workshop 🙏,btohqsg
My friend mechanic also say cn7 should be ok,btohqsg
CN7 only got 1 model what no meh,btohqsg

Went to shell to pump fuel. The guy over pump till it leak out. I estimated about 3l of fuel over pump. Wana check what’s the impact on my car ah?,btohqsg
