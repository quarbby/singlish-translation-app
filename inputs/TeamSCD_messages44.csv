Turbo is fun for the kick,btohqsg
small turbo lag okok la  like nt there 1,btohqsg

small turbo means better low end,btohqsg
Top end not making much boost,btohqsg
my ZC33 after 5.5k no strength already,btohqsg
Big turbo means got lag  but good high end,btohqsg
ya thats why i like. ez torque low end,btohqsg

VTEC also making power in high RPM  but also so popular,btohqsg

Change car like go 711 buy sweet😂😂😂,btohqsg

There's a certain thing about cars making same power from 1kRPM to redline that is so enticing,btohqsg
