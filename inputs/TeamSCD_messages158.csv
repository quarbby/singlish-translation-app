!!! I know you drunk. PLS CHILL.,btohqsg
how to check if you on coilovers ?,btohqsg
Looks like you on lowering springs,btohqsg
Strut looks stock. Spring definitely not. Conclusion probably lowering springs. Look at the top hat inside the hood for an adjustable knob. No knob = probably stock struts  possibly but unlikely aftermarket sus,btohqsg
When in doubt  just change üòÇ,btohqsg
Left: bilstein b6 aftermarket struts with stock springs. Right: tein advance flex Z coilovers. Visually it will be hard to ascertain. The key difference is adjustable dampers.,btohqsg
