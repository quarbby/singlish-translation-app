Reminder that I need to set up my own banking account referral links now,btohqsg
Will use your referrals! I am intending to change my POSB card also. Donâ€™t know if referral links will help haha.,btohqsg
Have no idea man. Waiting for Boss Chris to review lol!,btohqsg
Quite decent  it is in addition of all the new account bonuses.Anyway  updated my referral links athttps://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=124040923224466&id=108288068133085&sfnsn=mo(See pinned message),btohqsg
Anyone took credit sure plus together with uob absolute?,btohqsg
Its a product by prudential  UOB's insurance partner,btohqsg
Yea looks like a no go,btohqsg
seems that AMEX is still not workingðŸ˜¢ can be a bad sign,btohqsg
have  you try remove card and then reenter again,btohqsg
i did tha last time and it work,btohqsg
i tried last night. it worked..,btohqsg
I did  but that didn't help,btohqsg
Last time when i had this issue  i called amex (for true cashback card).If you're using uob amex then call uob. Most likely trigger a warning on their side and blocked grab for large amounts. Just need to manually unblock by CSO,btohqsg
For reference i did a $3000 grab top up through uob abs amex yesterday  went through fine,btohqsg
i cancelled my maybank fnf card in april. moved to citi cashback. citi cashback vs maybank fnf  which do you guys think is better? use mainly for groceries (redmart)  dining  food delivery and online shopping. from what i read on hwz  for fnf  lazada and shopee are not included in online shopping but qoo10 is.,btohqsg
im considering switching back to fnf. they recently revamped their Treats app. you can track your eligible cashback almost instantaneuosly.,btohqsg
If qoo10 is eligible for fnf thats a great opportunity already,btohqsg
why do you say that  chris? most stuff on qoo10 i can find on shopee and lazada and usualyl cheaper eh,btohqsg
what's your take on citi cashback vs maybank fnf?,btohqsg
I take a more holistic approach not just on base price but vouchers  card discounts  affiliate fees,btohqsg
So i try to compare across,btohqsg
hm yea thats a fair point. tough choice between citi cashback and maybank fnf for me...,btohqsg
But to be fair  most of the time shopee wins   coupled with uob one 10%,btohqsg
For me easily fnf because of the wider categories  even with the smaller limit. Will do a video on this next time,btohqsg
Unless say u have $800 a month grocery spending  then easily citi cashback,btohqsg
one very frustrating thing is grabfood. ineligible for cashbacks on either card,btohqsg
no choice got to uob amex abso -> grabpay for that,btohqsg
Yup  grabfood always follows transport mcc. So just uob one for me,btohqsg
man  i get sick tracking the stupid uob month cycle,btohqsg
Uob one is very tough  that's why thre rewards are high,btohqsg
Think uob one its good when you got a certain high and fixed expense allocated. The mafan comes in if theres variable high expense then need to keep track everytime.,btohqsg
All variable expense: Uob amex grabpay$300 fixed expense: maybank platinum visa$500 fixed expense: uob one  citi smrt$600 fixed expense: ocbc frank  dbs live fresh  uob evol$800 fixed expense: maybank fnf  citi cashback$1000 fixed expense: uob one  maybank platinum visa$2000 fixed expense: uob one,btohqsg
^Above is for cashback cards onlyDoes not apply to miles/rewards cards,btohqsg
things got really weird now.. I could not even use my visa cardðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
Nice video!!! Thanks for sharing. But damn your net worth at 12YO is more than my net worth after I grad from uni hahah ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
I remember we used to play/collect those flag erasers during primary school too hahaha,btohqsg
Must be coming from the huge student loan debts? Haha  next time I will talk about it,btohqsg
Yes  like which country eraser somehow has magic power over others,btohqsg
Embarrass to say that it must be from all the hanging out with friends for social activities ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
Yeah all these discretionary stuff sure adds up,btohqsg
The truth is  the more friends you have  might not necessarily make you more happy. BUT definitely make you spend more money!,btohqsg
Hey Chris  for Absolute Card to be able to earn 2.9% from GRAB pay  you will need to be a platinum member first right?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I've downloaded the Revolute app  but how do I get the $20 from your referral link?,btohqsg
24h left for Revolut $20!Remember to complete three $10 transactions using your virtual card that you could activate instantly after sign up and top up,btohqsg
Hi  do you have any suggested way to top up Kopitiam prepard card? I just found that it's not eligible for Citi Cashback +,btohqsg
Uob absolute amex or Grabpay mc,btohqsg
ðŸ¤£ amex + grabpay  the ultimate solution to all problems,btohqsg
Yeah  it use to be Uob one + grabpay to EVERY problem,btohqsg
btw  for anyone who was interested in the weird issue: I contacted Grab and they told me because I added too many card (>5 cards) to my GrabPay account  my account was put into some blacklist for risk control. Then I was required to provide photos of these cards to refresh my account and now everything works fine,btohqsg
