Nvidia probably would grow in the next few years even if there is a secular bear market  but once their dominance is challenged it won’t keep growing,btohqsg
For the next 5 years at least analysts don’t think their position as leader would be challenged so you’re safe holding,btohqsg
At least your ubs shares are up,btohqsg
So you think they should’ve let saved credit suisse to allow more competition?,btohqsg
Fuck no but unrealised is unrealised,btohqsg
theres always the block and report function,btohqsg
It can go to the moon,btohqsg
Yeah. They should have taken a more free market approach and provide a larger loan.,btohqsg
Something like TARP would have been better.,btohqsg
After the 10-1 stock split I’m quite sure there would come a time later this year where NVDA would dip below 100 (which means less than 1000 before the stock split)  not like the massive rally would continue forever. While earnings growth is impressive for Q1 I don’t think the growth rate would remain the same for the rest of this year so it’s kind of overhyped  but over the next few years since the fundamentals of the company are strong  1255 is probably not the high yet,btohqsg
Sekali NVDA reaches 5T valuation by next year,btohqsg
NVDA rivals the GDP of the USA,btohqsg
NVDA is currently just below 3T valuation  to reach 3k the market cap would have to more than double which probably isn’t anytime soon,btohqsg
Just invest what you’re prepared to lose,btohqsg
U will learn what Regulation T means soon when that has been unlocked.,btohqsg
I just checked  it’s 25T lol,btohqsg
I did Biotech before it's prepared to lose more than what u put in,btohqsg
I don’t think that’s ever happening,btohqsg
People have committed suicide after borrowing money to invest and then losing almost everything lol don’t do it to urself,btohqsg
You want to borrow to invest invest in safe stuff,btohqsg
Ok knock my door if nvidia is collapsing,btohqsg
If it happens means NVDA price reaches 10k  or 1k after the stock split,btohqsg
Just set a stop loss above your purchase price lol,btohqsg
How many NVDA shares did you purchase,btohqsg
Yeah I mean it has to rise 8 times above the current price,btohqsg
So I really think it’s almost impossible,btohqsg
Market Cap doesn't work by price,btohqsg
I mean to reach 25T market cap  the stock price would have to rise more than 8 times,btohqsg
I thought it’s current price times this,btohqsg
Assuming the shares outstanding stays the same. Yes,btohqsg
Damn so you’re up about 4000usd now,btohqsg
Yeah so I meant that after the stock split  if the market cap were to rise 8 times  stock price would roughly be 1k. Cos that accounts for the increase in no of shares,btohqsg
Shares outstanding will always increase one,btohqsg
It's just by how much and the rate.,btohqsg
I can make it 300k per share if I just reverse split GME like crazy but that would make no diff to the company,btohqsg
That's 8k in captial what's your portfolio diversity like siol,btohqsg
Unless u tell me u got a 100k portfolio.Why,btohqsg
Can afford to lose it all for the chance of 10x capital,btohqsg
Yolo  diamond hands  hodl  to the moon  never sell  etc.,btohqsg
No possible unless u leverage on options and sell strikes on a leveraged etf,btohqsg
Technically possible if you yolo all into 1 stock and hold,btohqsg
It's risky bit theres a chance you can 10x,btohqsg
Hold till 10x? Wdf u buying penny stocks arh,btohqsg
Like if you bought aapl 12 years ago  you would have 10x alr,btohqsg
Stubborn hodl does work sometimes  you know,btohqsg
If you don’t losing it all continue holding else set a stop loss  say something like at 100usd per share after the stock split. That way you’d make 2000usd. If you don’t mind seeing your account going red  even if the share price dips below your average price you bought at hold and wait for it to rise so that you can sell at a price you want to cash out at  just make sure it’s realistic and do your own research.,btohqsg
Ah yes cherry pick your data to just before the Great Recession,btohqsg
Now this is just dumb  there's a reason why TQQQ's chart looks horrible,btohqsg
Big recession is more than 12 years ago,btohqsg
Yeah so that’s why I took into account the stock split  since I assume it means shares outstanding would be multiplied by 10,btohqsg
