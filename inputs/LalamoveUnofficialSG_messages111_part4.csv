Jln Jurong kechil to cck  6 stops.,btohqsg
For me fri-sun is good. 1000-1300 and 1700-2000hrs. For me lah. Dunno the rest,btohqsg
Anyway anyone here countered pick up more than 10mins from merchant and what do you all do aft that?,btohqsg
Peak timing got way of doing. Off peak also can make depending on how n what jobs u do.,btohqsg
Nowdays is more dependent on whether u can win the bid for the job. And whether have enough jobs. If can win bids everytime  anytime also can make money,btohqsg
For me  if job at Ion requires trolley  I don’t go. Firstly security sure ask u to to take service lift and secondly the collection very likely  takes more than 10mins so will have to pay for parking.,btohqsg
Didn't know need trolley. First time take n they didn't write in notes. Reach then realised that 1 box is ridiculous heavy😂🤷‍♂,btohqsg
Walk abit then stop walk abit then stop😂,btohqsg
Gentle reminder don't 4get to cash out tonight,btohqsg
After you takebthe order  they change to other far far location,btohqsg
Put go chinatown  pay cash. When order take  change Upper thomason Rd  ghost Place. Then refuse to pay the different.,btohqsg
This one hand in hand that place?,btohqsg
Llm said within 10km  basic price no change,btohqsg
I want to comment but later kena kan again so 🤐😂,btohqsg
Kena one or two smelly pattern  u know next time not to take their orders,btohqsg
I got quite a few in my list  see their post I also won’t take their jobs  either last minute cancel  or add stop for few bucks without informing or those knn a lot of items but price like shit.,btohqsg
They all say can contact CS etc but waste time and end up  they not really helping at all. So save ourselves the trouble  see those ownself avoid lor,btohqsg
At least the Cs got entertain u😂,btohqsg
But on a side note  we all know the Cs 80% of the time is cui. Sometimes lucky get good Cs from the other 20%. So when we get lousy ones  just try to chill  cos it's expected. As long as u nvr kena penalise  then ignore. In the long run it'll be better for u  cos u won't keep getting frustrated n high blood pressure😊😂,btohqsg
But it's ok to vent over here on the chat  helps to cool us down😂😂,btohqsg
U have another 30mins. They close service at 10pm😂😂,btohqsg
I kena alot of shit when I first started doing llm last Yr. Then came to realise no pt gg thru Cs for alot of stuff  unless it's major shit. Even when resto late  unless it's late by very long  I also tell myself sua  not worth getting angry or stress. This job can get a decent income  but it's not gg to net me a super high income. So don't want give myself hbp over all the shit. Even if recipient cb or scold. I just 1 ear in n out. As long as I didn't do anytg wrong  I just f care all the other shit,btohqsg
Issit girl. She trying to hook up with u😂😂,btohqsg
I tot ur lala is for lalamove😂,btohqsg
Sorry  I monk for many many yrs liao😂,btohqsg
I think restaurant is late n whether they want to compensate is depends on restaurant.  I kana pan pac Chinese restaurant late. They willing to paid. Those lousy restaurant sure no %$$  to pay,btohqsg
Then maybe the Cs is guy😂,btohqsg
So I will pick n choose the delivery job just incase they late,btohqsg
Pick n choose is a must. Learn from experience,btohqsg
This is why when newbies come in n ask abt where do better  etc. There's nothing that beats personal experience,btohqsg
Even now  80% of my jobs r from reg restos. Once awhile pick those new or no restaurant type job,btohqsg
That's y I'm harsh when newbies come in ask things like where good to do  what day  time  this resto good or not  any1 do b4,btohqsg
Every1 have diff experience sometimes for the same resto  how to share,btohqsg
Nowadays people like to spoon feed,btohqsg
Delivery also must do homework de le,btohqsg
N honestly speaking  we're here to earn an income. Who would want to share where good etc? When the pie is already getting smaller. We stupid ah,btohqsg
Yup  my 1st 1.5-2 mths I do alot of homework. Recce resto  parking  routes etc,btohqsg
But I see from 1 driver n learn from him. He have a weekly draw chart with time frame.,btohqsg
What time is the delivery n free Timing to do,btohqsg
We see n learn from other to equip ourselves better,btohqsg
Previous got old bird share some stuff with me,btohqsg
But I also do few mths then we got discuss 1,btohqsg
Nowdays see some just come in say new then ask,btohqsg
I think I say enough liao. Later pple complain again. Anyway again remember to cash out😂😂,btohqsg
I kena fine from 1st offence give chance until now $100+ for each fine. Until I scared. Just park cp. Pay for cp😂,btohqsg
Also I do LLM job will choose only those dun need to pay Parking. Haha,btohqsg
This is of cos 1st choice. But sometimes no job cannot choose😂,btohqsg
Like orchard  area. I will not do at all,btohqsg
They catch all pavement themselves  hiding at any bushes or hotel,btohqsg
U do few hundred each mth ah? Fierce. I think my highest only 130+,btohqsg
