My ss Cher taught me that this source has an ulterior motive and is biased,btohqsg
She must be so proud hehe,btohqsg
the purpose of my text was to persuade students with no EAE to come to TP because base on personal experience TP has the best experience for students compared to any other poly.,btohqsg
furthermore i am a sec5 student and not a TP student. thus no bias !,btohqsg
*the woman was too stunned to speak*,btohqsg

she was too surprised based on its purpose and provenance,btohqsg
Indeed  the owner of the source confirms it,btohqsg
