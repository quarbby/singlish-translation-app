ok ah I think we're going too deep into the rabbit hole of can people send non-rule breaking stuff into the group based on our own personal beliefs so let's just chill on that topic and talk about smth else,btohqsg

no point going deeper into that hole,btohqsg
if anyone has a problem with this gc letting people send non-rule breaking things u can let me know,btohqsg
depends on what your goal is i guess,btohqsg
