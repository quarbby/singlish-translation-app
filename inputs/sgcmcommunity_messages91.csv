the owner bought the car when the COE was at 80k. so does that mean he can recoup a bit by selling it now since the coe is high?,btohqsg
but if you buying a new car then no diff since coe also high,btohqsg
yea... so maybe he is thinking of getting a more affordable one....,btohqsg
Fluctuations in COE don't change much to him,btohqsg
Very small part of his total price,btohqsg

recoup is recoup la  but marginal compared to what he spend over the past year not including the car price,btohqsg

There are people with too much money who wrap  PPF and then add ceramic coat to the car. Cost like 5k++ for one Porsche macan,btohqsg
Can pull handbrake then lay back with your ice cold root beer,btohqsg
Wrap+ppf+ceramic is more like 7.5k for a Macan sir,btohqsg
Ngl 5k is cheap for all that combined,btohqsg
Wrap itself for a good one close to 3.5,btohqsg

These shouldn't be the reasons to stop you from buying a particular car 👀What do you look out for when trying to shortlist the cars that you are going to buy? Is it the price of the car  is it the brand  or could the engine capacity and  hence  road tax be a key reason to avoid a certain car? 🤔Many factors come together to affect our decision when choosing a car to buy  but here are some that really don't matter as much as you think.👉🏻 Comment and share any other reasons you can think of as well!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg

in fact we both know someone who’d think oh 186k is within my budget even if it’s for two years 🌚🌚,btohqsg
Whats the difference between car loans from a bank and dealer/second hand car dealer ?,btohqsg
And banks won’t let you full loan your car,btohqsg
The latter does  thus the crazy interest rates,btohqsg
So technically speaking banks dont let you downpay any amount you want but dealers allow you . And thus they have crazy interest rates?,btohqsg
You can full loan with banks,btohqsg
Your question is between bank loans and in house loan?,btohqsg
Dont you need to die die pay 30 or 40 based of omv,btohqsg
Yea im just curious how both work exactly,btohqsg
Can just say different price ah,btohqsg
In house loan also 100% get,btohqsg
Or bank loan checks your credentials more thorough. In house don't,btohqsg
this are not loop holes. it is illegal.,btohqsg
So bank you really got to pay either 30 or 40 right be it a new or used car,btohqsg
But in house dealer loans are flexible but risky because they can charge high interest and it might change suddenly ? Or will it be fixed,btohqsg
Depends on the loan  situation by situation basis,btohqsg
Honestly just down 30% snd get a bank loan,btohqsg
but there is always a possibility they charge astronomical interest rate,btohqsg
"thought i hearsay before that PPSL will buy in your car at an ""overpriced"" rate so that they can give you more loan percentage if inhouse  so technically your ""rebate offset"" for another car from them is lower price hence lower loan amount but it will be clawed back through further loan amendments.. not sure how it works",btohqsg
Think no business wants to lose their reputation by giving you fluctuating interest rate. But usually on the lapse of credentials results in higher interest rate. Cause they know you're desperate. Is either them or personal loan. Cause bank you sure fail.,btohqsg
Oh right cause banks check your profile,btohqsg
Dam so technically bank loans are the safest way to go,btohqsg
And if you take a in house loan theres always gonna always be that risk there,btohqsg
Increase price of car to increase loan value since you are only allowed 60-70% of loan value depending on OMV or ARF cant remember. So you can borrow 90% of the initial car value when the bank think its 70%.,btohqsg
But this is very easily traceable when they have to file gst,btohqsg
I notice also banks are more “forgiving” if you late,btohqsg
Definitely. So bank loan either you apply yourself or dealer apply for you. Dealers usually have preferential bank rates,btohqsg
rare black paint and manual model,btohqsg
If apply yourself means go bank do it then like link with the dealer is it,btohqsg
i think army need teach financial literacy as a syllabus now,btohqsg
They buy your car at higher price with overtrade to offer you discount,btohqsg
it’s basically kia’s retarded korean cousin w a US passport,btohqsg
Not give you more loan percentage,btohqsg
Interest is usually fixed but high,btohqsg
Now upto 4.28 min for many,btohqsg
5.98 is the average that most people get,btohqsg
But the issue is that one has no equity in the car,btohqsg
So when you go off to sell it,btohqsg
You still owe a lot to the lender including your interest,btohqsg
But your car is not worth that much,btohqsg
no bro full loan a aveo,btohqsg
More so with used car dealers not new dealers,btohqsg
New dealers usually never offer full loans,btohqsg
Giving you equity in the car,btohqsg
honestly i think we wouldn’t troll the fella this hard if he had got back to us,btohqsg
60 to 70% of OMV/price of car,btohqsg
Never seen the group unite to help one fella,btohqsg
Late fees aren't as high if you are late,btohqsg
Assuming they do  then pls make sure they pass on the benefits to you.,btohqsg
I managed to get hong leong to forgive me for one late payment fee,btohqsg
I forgot my giro didn’t set up,btohqsg
You go bank do it  they will assess accordingly then once passed  they will disburse the funds to the dealer,btohqsg
For all people not just men,btohqsg
School should revamp s3x ed too,btohqsg
ndp rally should have a why u shouldn’t full loan a car,btohqsg
I am unsure of the sec school syllabus followed,btohqsg
But I assume it's outdate like most places,btohqsg

Buy and sell your 2nd car parts !,btohqsg
must find place to park too,btohqsg
need do until this extent anot.. LOL,btohqsg
Then how you gonna transfer the petrol,btohqsg
put pipe  suck on it then put in singapore pipe i assume,btohqsg
no leh  he take singapore car malaysia I think,btohqsg
you really think the savings can be worth the time you spend doing all of this,btohqsg
then you waste fuel waiting at checkpoint and driving to and fro parking spot in singapore and malaysia also,btohqsg
I thought he wanna zhng car like siao,btohqsg
bro.. the 60 cents savings per litre not worth all this effort la imho,btohqsg
the savings likely nullified by the extra distance he has to drive in the malaysia reg car and the sg reg car to wherever he does the transfer,btohqsg
and the cost of the malaysia reg car,btohqsg
this is assuming place to park in malaysia is free,btohqsg
and no fines are incurred because of fuel check when crossing the border,btohqsg
and he lives close to one of the two checkpoints,btohqsg
even then  you work out the cost-benefit analysis,btohqsg
how long you need this to work,btohqsg
before you break even or start saving,btohqsg
Sinopec got 25% discount for you my guy,btohqsg
and how are you parking in malaysia,btohqsg
and how much of a difference will it make if you just take your current car over to malaysia  fill 97,btohqsg
probably can cover the difference already,btohqsg
not counting additional costs you incur or fuel wasted in this exercise,btohqsg
you include extra mileage and cost of malaysia car,btohqsg
Bro just get the fuel switch,btohqsg
one day 40 litres x 60 cents = $24,btohqsg
if you factor in car cost and extra fuel burnt,btohqsg
you don't need malaysia reg car for that,btohqsg
im counting if u pump RON 95 vs RON 97  which is only a 60cent difference,btohqsg
you save 22 dollars per trip,btohqsg
but you spend on buying a car in malaysia,btohqsg
you just go in your car pump malaysia 97,btohqsg
Yea can buy car in JB,btohqsg
Wanna be stubborn like the aveo guy sure,btohqsg
and how far u drive a year,btohqsg
What car you drive for grab,btohqsg
That can finish 40l tank everyday,btohqsg
28k a year can buy new car liao bro,btohqsg
pump 97 no need malaysia car,btohqsg
So if never save  u spent $2k+ of petrol per month? 😱,btohqsg
All my life taking grab/uber/taxi whatever,btohqsg
I seriously damn curious what car has 80 litres of fuel tank space now 😂😂😂,btohqsg
The max i ever saw was 55litres,btohqsg
Wahahaha never heard of drivers complain until like this,btohqsg
Eh bro U tell me what make,btohqsg
Dun need tell me model. Sgcarmart has everything,btohqsg
Maybe custom make one.. extend 2nd tank put at spare tyre well..,btohqsg
Your NET SAVINGS by pumping Malaysia 95 over Malaysia 97 by using Malaysia Car and transfering*ASSUMING YOU GET THROUGH CUSTOMS EVERYTIME AND DON'T STAND THERE FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR EVERYTIME AND NEVER KENA SINGAPORE FINE*NET SAVINGS ANNUAL= $4159 OR $11.4 a day,btohqsg
and you can cover up already,btohqsg
and if you claim to have 80L tank,btohqsg
your FC not very good for sure,btohqsg
cause only bigger vans and SUVs or conti sedan have 70 to 80L tank,btohqsg
but no one is asking you to pump sg 95 lah bro,btohqsg
Quite stupid to do phv with conti sedan,btohqsg
the whole push here is to tell you to pump msia 97,btohqsg
you will net off better and have more time to do maybe 1 or 2 more rides compared to what you waste moving 2 cars,btohqsg
brother I do numbers for you alr,btohqsg
this is with this assumption in mind ah,btohqsg
Drive car until need to skim petrol till like tt  might as well don’t drive,btohqsg
Bro EVEN IF U REALLY WANNA COMPARE  iT shud Be SG 95 Vs Msia RON 97,btohqsg
Wa bro what car u drive,btohqsg
BECAUSE HE IS ADAMANT ON PUMPING MSIA,btohqsg
a lot of cars have 70L+ tank,btohqsg
Mazda cx 8? So big ah sorry bro I suagu 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Push car better  save more petrol,btohqsg
The cars i drive before all 50 litres only,btohqsg
Conti exec sedans  5er  A6  E class all,btohqsg
A lot of car have >70l,btohqsg
Else every day run to petrol kiosk,btohqsg
Wa bro U pump diesel in msia must pump B7  which is 2.35  the lower grade one rlly not good,btohqsg
