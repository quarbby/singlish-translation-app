Hi.Is there any other way to scan for kofu QR code? Try to use Xnap app but cannot work for kofu.,btohqsg
By mid mar should be safe  but do note that to convert to miles there is minimum and each conversion have fee thus usually i sweep clean all for 1 year worth,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm aiming to convert all year worth. So before middle of march. Got it  thanks,btohqsg
Hi  if I use CRMC on grab for transport and grabfood order not wallet top up. Will get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Did you check if that the vendor has XNAP logo on the SG QR?,btohqsg
Not every SRQR can use XNAP  must be with XNAP logo then can use. Usually only available on newest SGQR+,btohqsg
3 fund portfolio1. Voo2. Qqqm3. Schd4. Cpf top up 8k annuallyIs this good?,btohqsg
a. Should consider overlaps between funds affecting risk (e.g. Apple is in both VOO and QQQM  potentially there are stocks which appear in all three ETFs)b. You can divert the funds meant for these portfolios through SRS contributions first for additional tax savings if not alreadyc. CPF contribution strategy would heavily depend on what kind of returns you think you could get outside and your timeline. If you're investing in 100% equities then putting away 8k in SA/MA may actually be the worse performing option vs investing directly  even accounting for the upfront tax savings.,btohqsg
Thanks  noted that overlapping risk  currently not in the tax bracket that worth toping up more than 8k  cpf is just an additional step as was inspired by Chris to reach FRS and also 1M65.,btohqsg
SRS you can top up every year so there‚Äôs less need to worry about which year you‚Äôll be in a higher/lower tax bracket to strategise so much. But if you‚Äôre saving up for other things (home  marriage  etc) then having to locking up the funds till 63+ is an additional considerationThis is different from topping up SA/MA where yes you‚Äôll hit BHS and FRS and then you can‚Äôt top up anymore  so you may need to be a bit more strategic with when you do those top ups over the course of your career,btohqsg
Hi can i know if uob kf cc annual fee waiver is possible,btohqsg
You can search chat history using ‚ÄúUob krisflyer waive‚Äù. There is data point on this in chat history.,btohqsg
UOB CNY Savings Bonus Promo:Assuming there is this promo  we shall empty out UOB One Account on 29th or 30th Dec 2023?If we empty 100k on either of the above date  are we still able to get the $400 saving bonus for Dec 2023?,btohqsg
Ur 3 ETFs are basically all US mkt  with extra weigh on tech and dividend paying coys. Rather than diversification  which is the essence of a 3-fund portfolio  urs is making ur portfolio more concentrated in specific sectors within the US mkt instead. but if those sectors are what u believe in over the long term  then i guess those ETFs are good choices given their low fees. However  i will go with cspx or vuaa instead of voo  for lower dividend withholding tax and no estate tax.,btohqsg
1. 29th is safer in my opinion2. U need to keep ADB at $100k with account at $0 on 29th December onwards. Use excel to calculator what‚Äôs the balance u need to keep until then. I kept $111k from 1st December already.,btohqsg
$0 for 3 days is alot of damage to the average..! LOL,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtYou din participate UOB Xmas promo?,btohqsg
You need to keep daily balance at $110 714.30 between 1-28 Dec to enjoy max 5% interest if you transferred out on 29 Dec.If transfer out on 30 Dec  daily balance between 1-29 Dec shall be $106 896.55,btohqsg
19 days of december have since passed..haha,btohqsg
You need to do your own calculation what is your average daily balance as of 19 Dec. Then from there top up the amount difference today(20 Dec).,btohqsg
Need extra 45k if from 22nd Dec onwards,btohqsg
"Let say the CNY Promo truly starts on 31 Dec 2023  we can participate immediately and transfer back this ""fresh fund"" back to UOB or will hv to participate only after 30 days?",btohqsg
hahaha...datz why i said..3 days of zero...really pull down your MAB,btohqsg
ya ..my stash account had to calculate after 3 days of interest didn't move out...haiz..now stuck with a higher MAB amount that i can't dip under,btohqsg
Hi all  any idea why the US markets are beating money market funds by a wide margin now (and growing bigger by the day)? And do you think by placing funds in short term FDs  T bills  etc is getting riskier by the day vs  example  equities that pay dividends? Curious to hear your thoughts,btohqsg
Im thinking of getting miles card in addition to my hsbc revo. Sadly  cant get signup bonus citi  dbs and stanchart cards as i recently canceled. What card should i consider?,btohqsg

Hi all  seeking some advice  any suggestions on what the MCC code will be on purchase of a new phone with 2 year contrast from Starhub? thanks in advance,btohqsg
