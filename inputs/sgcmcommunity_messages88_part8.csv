It's like doing very aggressive wide body kits on a Honda fit,btohqsg
i mean if ur gna do bodykits on a cn7  might as well do it all the way. Shows that aggressiveness profile of the car,btohqsg
Haven’t been to a cn7 meetup before  but wish there’s one,btohqsg
I feel it's a bit too long and flowy for an aggressive wide body,btohqsg
The proportions don't work the best,btohqsg
there should be a car group for it. gotta find,btohqsg
End up looking like this but longer,btohqsg
I do this the Elantra N kit would look better than N line on the cn7@woshijordanjr,btohqsg
The only good looking custom wbk I could find for the cn7,btohqsg
But must commit to changing wheels and doing suspension,btohqsg
Yea  I looking for such body kits  later I take photo of my current body kit  doesn’t look as good,btohqsg
I don't think you have a body kit on right now....,btohqsg
Spent 1k on it :( but still doesn’t look as good as N line,btohqsg
Check out '2020 Hyundai CN7 Avante Side Skirt n Full bodykit ( Type C )'  available at S$230 on#Carousellhttps://carousell.app.link/Koz4TYW5gub,btohqsg
Ideally would wanna have this  but not with red line colors,btohqsg
what do u need to change,btohqsg
let my brother@awj_moodshow you good fitment,btohqsg
maybe u shud tune the car,btohqsg
to explode? NA car nothing to tune man,btohqsg
just boost abit of torque and HP. I personally feel hyundai cars r sluggish without some tuning or cold air intake modifications,btohqsg
i dont wanna tune yet because im still under komoco warranty,btohqsg
and dont wanna do anything to void the warranty,btohqsg
nice? idk man! i kinda feel like the side skirts would be nicer with the n line kind,btohqsg
ur car just got how long? slowly slowly do,btohqsg
but also because my car color is amazon grey  then the bodykit is black  and easily get water marks after raining  which looks ugly ah \,btohqsg
If you do the complete N kit  you'll void warranty on your parking sensors and cameras,btohqsg
Need to paint the bodykit to the same color,btohqsg
Because this involves changing the bumper as a whole,btohqsg
does it mean i have to disassemble them again?,btohqsg
dont need N kit  find a kit where the lip and bumper isnt so big. this is v big thats why doesnt look very good,btohqsg
oh damn  no lah dont wanna go that extend,btohqsg
The one you sent as the screenshots is not the N line but universal side skirt for any and all cars,btohqsg
also the red v ugly haha,btohqsg
The one he has now quite nice,btohqsg
new wheels and fitment wld be beyyer,btohqsg
maybe i will just consider changing the side skirts  or else i can look to spraying the body kits,btohqsg
"but definitely i wanna change my tire and rims. currently now mine is 16""  wanna get 18""",btohqsg
I'm sorry to say but this one is the universal one for all cars,btohqsg
means not as good as the one im having right now?,btohqsg
But your current ones much better in my opinion,btohqsg
thanks man! then maybe i look for shops that do respray at a cheaper price instead!,btohqsg
Yeah because the N kit as a whole changes both front and rear bumpers completely,btohqsg
Like changing regular A4 bumper to rs4 kind,btohqsg
Try to look at 17 also  that way can maintain driving comfort,btohqsg
arrow tyres my go to ba,btohqsg
alright! will see the main difference first,btohqsg
For tyres I go to Kim hoe,btohqsg
Bigger inch = more FC tho,btohqsg
1 or 2 inches don't make a huge difference,btohqsg
The issue is when people change rims and then get cheap tyres,btohqsg
