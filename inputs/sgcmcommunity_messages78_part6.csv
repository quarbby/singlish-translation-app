R8 V8 was really nice haha,btohqsg
Thinking of it for a daily if I ever gonna get a v8,btohqsg

Turbos are monsters. Too much power kinda spoils the fun for me.,btohqsg

Not particularly but I might agree with some of his ideologies,btohqsg
me trying to find ur sense of humour,btohqsg
Good price to experience a r8 once in a lifetime. May not be the best  in fact could be the worse  but can still sound quite brutal and still looks good for its age.,btohqsg
haha imo completely different. R8 has a much wider stance  much more comfortable interior etc,btohqsg
it feels more relaxed in the R8,btohqsg
ðŸ˜± sick price for a vr6  its a legend but its no v8 lol,btohqsg
personal experience la haha  S5 just get 3.0,btohqsg
Technically this BMW got Mercedes also,btohqsg

Then get a base model civic,btohqsg
And floor also wont hit 100,btohqsg
Sorry i meant to say v8. Not r8 hahahah,btohqsg

There is a reason why the 3.0 is 15k depre lol,btohqsg

Wow speedster. I recently saw the boxster speedster,btohqsg
no worries  wait for full loan boys to realise they need to sell at loan settlement price,btohqsg
