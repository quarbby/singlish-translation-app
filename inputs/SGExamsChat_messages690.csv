So it still kinda need phys but not necessarily h2 ba,btohqsg

I want to study basket weaving,btohqsg
No…u maybe surprised but there are 6 pointers in tm,btohqsg

Os and As has no correlation,btohqsg
My class had one and another 10points,btohqsg
Yeah I know such a guy  he said his house was close but in the end still got almost 90 rp,btohqsg
Yea some ppl definitely chose based on location,btohqsg
Coz look at where are the good JCs located,btohqsg
Clearly not near some housing places lmao,btohqsg
engi/science (unless specialised): H2 maths H2 sciencebiz: H1 maths,btohqsg
Imagine pasir ris traveling to bishn👀👀,btohqsg
like i scared my chem cmi so i take h2 hist,btohqsg
For me is i know i wun survive h2 phy,btohqsg
But doesnt environment matter tho? I’m sure at RJC or HCI you’ll have way more muggers than a lower tier school which would essentially motivate you to study as well  at least for me I think it affects me lots,btohqsg
Plot twist where im 100th percentile in all exam (except j1 mye) for h1👀👀,btohqsg
well yes but does the environment affect u,btohqsg
Idk how I survived but i did lol,btohqsg
for some ppl it does for others it won't and if it won't affect u then u can go anywhere u want,btohqsg
That is why i said TM has taught me resilience to peer pressure,btohqsg
And I’m very sure I would have found more motivated people to participate in ECs with in the elite JCs if I had made it there,btohqsg
Not sure if u read but my class in itself was toxic but i just shut people off ah,btohqsg
Idk what i was thinking but i got my class champion for math awareness fortnight by doing the math puzzles myself,btohqsg
Yea tm i had to beg for resources,btohqsg
Yea exactly that’s why people pay tons to get into ivies,btohqsg
Im surprised my chem cher entertained my request,btohqsg
And ofc it took a lot of time lmao  idk HOW i did it,btohqsg
Im not sure about urs but for tm we need to get an offer first,btohqsg
Maybe that was just my ignorance looking back lol,btohqsg
Im pretty sure ppl who dun get offered wun know about it (in tm),btohqsg
My class i think only 3 ppl got offered,btohqsg
They got go thru h3 req and how to apply b4,btohqsg
Vivian is like an old man lol,btohqsg
So essentially you’d be applying to the best school in the continent  what are the chances,btohqsg
Ok yeah that part is true,btohqsg

it’s not like i have evidence so i can’t report to neaand if i report to the manager wouldn’t they try to cover for their employees??and if i post on google reviews WHO TF will read a mcdonald’s review,btohqsg
but i js feel so suffocated UK?!? LIKE ITS BOTHERING ME,btohqsg

tbh it's alr filthy I might as well be ignorant,btohqsg
what considers as not proper hygiene tho,btohqsg
leaving food out in the open overnight,btohqsg
common doesn’t mean it should be accepted,btohqsg
it shldnt but that's how the industry is,btohqsg
but i still won’t accept it,btohqsg
if they dw listen then it’s on them,btohqsg
udw listen u can js go and eat again no one gna stop u,btohqsg
I mean... u ownself say no photo evidence why shld I listen to your supposed witness accounts,btohqsg
I'm not tryna say you not doing good but,btohqsg
IM NOT FORCING U TO ??,btohqsg
on what basis shld I trust u?,btohqsg
But idk like some restaurants can js fire their workers n not necessarily shut down the entire restaurant,btohqsg
for those who wanna take my advice,btohqsg
It sometimes depends on the workers i get where u r coming from,btohqsg
i say it not to harm people,btohqsg
and if your whole argument is don't trust don't trust lor then your entire case falls apart because you're not giving anyone a reason to believe u,btohqsg
it’s for everyone who’s scared of food poisoning,btohqsg
I'm not saying idw trust u bro u not giving anyone a reason to trust u,btohqsg
personally i’d like it if people told me what they witnessed,btohqsg
so i can just avoid the risk uk?,btohqsg
start pre recording people in mcdonald’s bathroom,btohqsg
ok then I tell u yk got one ice cream cafe in tanjong pagar I go last time I see the guy dig nose then serve ice cream,btohqsg
this is a PSA not a law case or wtv brodie,btohqsg
tell us all so we can be wary,btohqsg
"not law but just saying why ""don't trust me don't trust lor"" isn't a particularly good reason to get someone to trust you in a cause that you believe in",btohqsg
if it’s like an actual case i’m tryna win,btohqsg
i’d pull up with evidence and talk properly,btohqsg
and out of the kindness of my heart,btohqsg
i js wanna share my story,btohqsg
are u rlly beefing w me,btohqsg
btw@IcedMilodid anyone tell u u give 🤓☝️ urm ackshually,btohqsg
nah I just like riling up ppl,btohqsg
i believe it is all the way at the end before u click submit,btohqsg
i’m not like the other guys 😜,btohqsg
but i recall i submitted in 1 single folder,btohqsg
u mean at the 'documents' they only ask for O and A level certs?,btohqsg
can u send a screenshot of what u seeing coz it is hard to help u that way,btohqsg
since i did my application 3y ago,btohqsg
but i recalled submitting the documents as a zip folder,btohqsg
coz iirc they only allow u to upload a single folder,btohqsg
so did you manage to study today lol,btohqsg
yes much better though was disrupted abit by my aunt mess...,btohqsg
but it was a topic i dun like so need to force myself more:-(,btohqsg
does phd follow the same ug sem timing,btohqsg
and i realised doing 10 exams and 3 assignments in a single semester sounds crazy:-(,btohqsg
but 4 will be gone in a blink of an eye soon,btohqsg
it's more like a full time job but during the sem breaks we take maybe 1-2 weeks off work,btohqsg
like summer period i'm working 2.5 out of the 3 months,btohqsg
idk what i hv been doing during summer lol,btohqsg
but apparently sucks to be me coz i heard that those people who did pharm assistant roles in hosp before get an edge in pre-reg application,btohqsg
still gotta do what you gotta do,btohqsg
but breaks are too short for mental health to return to baseline,btohqsg
we take all the recovery we can get,btohqsg
every week after my meetings i take one day off to do wtv i want,btohqsg
if not i wouldn't remain sane,btohqsg
save the topics you like for later so it feels less of a drag?,btohqsg
some intern mistyped a digit and now its 1k off,btohqsg

"no iw buy and sell ""2nd hand""",btohqsg
but the admin of that shop typoed,btohqsg
u won't get the full power of an ultra 9 or a 4070 in a laptop form factor,btohqsg
it's now cheaper than the g14 lol,btohqsg
oh ya do u guys see alot of ppl in acme de la vive shirt?,btohqsg
everyone I know with a gaming laptop tells me they regret buying,btohqsg
the chips r designed for laptops tho,btohqsg

caro price is more adjusted to market,btohqsg
this one rly intern typo bruh,btohqsg
but caro can only see the seller asking price,btohqsg

I actually realised that J2 MBTs  MYE and Prelim result slip  my lazy CTs wrote the exact same 1 liner lol,btohqsg
And i realised i dementia  my econs was A at MBTs  so As wasnt my first A,btohqsg
And what even gp d was 80-100 at mbt,btohqsg
once u submit then aft that can add supp docs,btohqsg
i submitted mine long ago 🥲,btohqsg
guys sorry i really tried looking for more info online but how do I ask my teachers to submit their referee reports? cos i saw on reddit law needs 2 referee reports (can’t find anything about it on their website though)the application process also never ask for email of my teachers.. how do i ask my teachers to submit their reports then? anyone have experience? 😭,btohqsg
have you submitted the application yet? seems like they’re saying you can still upload additional documents after submitting provided it’s before 19th,btohqsg
@kohsyanlocal unis dont actl take into account olvl or y4 results right,btohqsg
is just they want to verify ur identity right,btohqsg
they used to care but not anymore,btohqsg
So how does the ABA even work?,btohqsg
wdym how does it work? it’s basically looking at your portfolio,btohqsg
Er usually is you put referee name + whatever contact details and the org will contact the referee,btohqsg
It is different from when I applied but from the looks of it  I think this is the minimum documents required and additional supporting documents (if you wish to) can be submitted separately. After your 1st application  you may sign back in via application number,btohqsg
You need to do medical examination to certify you are fit,btohqsg
doing bio gives me such a big ego boost,btohqsg
did u eventually figure it out,btohqsg

Me after watching 2 Kurt Tay videos,btohqsg
No wonder you get along so well with rand,btohqsg
Nope  I waited for my dad to come back,btohqsg
hahahaha so how did it work,btohqsg
You mean given that the syllabus have changed will your old syllabus be available? I tot it is only changing in 2025 tho,btohqsg
I dunno about the price  but u can go anywhere ah UHC  any GP blah blah,btohqsg
It was coz my maid ask me to help drive in (after she finish washing car)  and then I can’t find a way to get it out of park lmao…and I can’t ask my dad coz I will get scolded coz in the first place my parents only allow me drive the other car (Mazda MPV),btohqsg
Yea I meant I thought the syllabuses changes in math and GP will only take effect in 2025 batch  meaning the 2024 A levels will still be the same?,btohqsg
2024 a lvl still same. So 2025 I cannot take 2023 syllabus ah,btohqsg
Oh you meant you prefer retaking in 2025?,btohqsg
I dun think the older syllabus will be available  but best to check with your teachers?,btohqsg
at least it gave us yt voice reveal,btohqsg
Reddit has a lot of a*******,btohqsg
I saw someone complaining about a 88.75rp before,btohqsg
Saying ‘my friends think i am capable of getting an A for GP  make me feel sad’,btohqsg
Tbh i feel like that was justified,btohqsg
Have you guys heard of silver medalist phenomenon,btohqsg
Yea that's what the person feels,btohqsg
But he deleted his post lol,btohqsg
Oh yea  i must say i dun openly say it but it happened to me before,btohqsg
For me i generally dont talk to other students about my marks anymore unless they're my very very close friends or like teachers,btohqsg
Like in j2  for h2 chem  i was always on this abuv 80% list that the department show  and then i internally felt like shit when my prelim  my practical pulled me down to 77.8% (but i know if i vent out people will ofc not be happy and whatever la),btohqsg
"in y2 i got 3.87 gpa and i was 1 mark away from A+ for maths and el so I vented to my ""best friend"" who got 3.93 (I chose to vent to her cause she did Better) and she ended up shittalking meNever telling ppl my grades again",btohqsg
I felt like shit though my chem cher was happy coz i eventually still got A despite a practical D,btohqsg
I hv no friend who does better than me in jc so i hv no one to vent,btohqsg
It's a common observation that people who get silver medal at Olympics will be sad while people who get gold and bronze will be comparatively happierGold happy because they're world champion  Bronze happy because at least got something. But silver feel not so happy cause is like so so so close to being best in the world ... and they didnt achieve it,btohqsg
Actually speaking of which i think i indirectly did so lol coz i openly shared w my teacher my unhappiness / i am not satisfied when my friends beside me  i said sth indirectly tho  i was like ‘but it is lower than 80/ lower than my previous marks’,btohqsg
Unfortunately these subjective things do be like that,btohqsg
I dun think it is easy for conduct grades to drop,btohqsg
Yea there are ppl who do like shit just dun wish to see posts like this,btohqsg
Meanwhile my classmates hv easy access to my marks  cher passes mark sheets around,btohqsg
And actually think about it  how many people scored below 88.75👀👀,btohqsg
Lol imagine that at sap schs,btohqsg
fking hunger games but not rlly vibes,btohqsg
Ofc will feel tilted by reading it,btohqsg
I dun think will be a case for everyone to get good grades coz of bell curve / grade boundaries,btohqsg
But i will just treat it as reddit is a platform to say anything the person wish to,btohqsg
Definitely prolly their way of making portfolio more important i guess,btohqsg
Coz now w/o pw n h1  there will be more 70 pointers and more ppl close to that ngl,btohqsg
Thrs a kid taking 3 seats on the mrt traun,btohqsg
But u could have just enlisted ltr,btohqsg
U literally going to ooc anyays,btohqsg
shld hv rsi on that day,btohqsg
Yes  if there is a new syllabus that would be examined the year after you take your A Levels. Subjects like GP would change syllabus this year so it would be your last chance to take the old syllabus this year.,btohqsg
Fml mosquitos is causing a distraction,btohqsg
This 2 days suddenly I receive a bolus dose of mosquito bites,btohqsg
also wats the ans/expln to this?,btohqsg
I think it is II and III but i dun really know why is III correct also,btohqsg
Coz I is wrong since the DWL triangle is always less than the tax revenue,btohqsg
I put mopiko but i guess now repellent is necessary👀👀,btohqsg
Yes indeed i freaking scratch until puopee,btohqsg
When I saw II and III,btohqsg
Yeah mopiko only helps provide relief for the existing bites,btohqsg
It keeps rain stop rain stop,btohqsg
When i want go out  immediately started raining,btohqsg
did u see the Sydney one?,btohqsg
III is phrased quite oddly haha  but i think what they are trying to get at is distorting the signalling property of price?,btohqsg
I think gemini a bit off,btohqsg
Im guessing the ''gains from trade'' is the consumer and seller welfare and the new price at SS curve + tax lowers the welfare so the consumers and sellers do not know the maximum welfare that they can be getting at the initial price whereby SS and DD intersect,btohqsg
wah it has been a year since i last done econs,btohqsg
it is a large language model.,btohqsg
shocked tht chatgpt and gemini cld solve it.,btohqsg
cuz chatgpt usually cnnt sovle my math qns,btohqsg
This kinda makes sense  i was using a very odd way to try explaining lmao,btohqsg
Coz i think i was thinking too much  i was linking gain from trade w like countries producing stuff at lower opportunity cost,btohqsg
Bruh im so not gonna finish this in 1h  are they crazy,btohqsg
Alright  gimme a full ride scholarship then,btohqsg
NTU really using this as a marketing harh,btohqsg

I met one of them irl before,btohqsg
hopefully i can go to us uni and work at taco bell there,btohqsg
thales made some military radio sets for saf also. so by being an nsf  u r funding the genocide in palestine,btohqsg
Why is my queue time so long,btohqsg
I had to queue for 1h,btohqsg
Pls my malay friends still eat macs,btohqsg
