your handwriting is so nice :D,btohqsg
Teach me your ways  I'm struggling here,btohqsg
Literally just be consistent with ur effort,btohqsg
No need do intense like 10hrs a day,btohqsg
A few productive hours is enough,btohqsg
No  I'm struggling to finish my essays,btohqsg
My problem is not the content or anything  I just cannot finish my paper in that duration.,btohqsg
I can finish GP on time but not ECOns,btohqsg
Ok 3 ways:1. Improve writing speed2. Spend less time thinking & idling3. Work on ur language and use more concise phrasing to cut down work count,btohqsg
Econs rly need use concise lang cuz too many things to cover,btohqsg
Lol i rarely use definitions  only use whenever its qn requirembt,btohqsg
Yeah  I cannot finish my essays in time.,btohqsg
True but wont be the main bulk,btohqsg
At most it gives u higher mark within the band,btohqsg
Rigour can be achieved in other ways,btohqsg
Like Ash said  definitions aren't always necessary,btohqsg
It is for H1  I believe.,btohqsg
Just that it consumes precious time,btohqsg
idk i use a fountain pen LOL,btohqsg
I know my school teachers harp on the H1 students for definition in their case study.,btohqsg
i think pilot pens are p smooth,btohqsg
i just dl some of the plastic pens,btohqsg
Nice  thank you for the recommendation!,btohqsg
not vv nice to write with and sometimes need alot of friction to write,btohqsg
Too smooth  my handwiring the letters tend to get connected,btohqsg
Last year 4m was basically a giveaway if u knew it for CSQ,btohqsg
o ya if thats a problem shld try others,btohqsg
Sarasa my 2nd option but i gonna try mugi or smth else,btohqsg
its smooth until its not for me,btohqsg
Sarasa always our go to pen,btohqsg
and often enough it happens wayy to early,btohqsg
ya sarasa alot of ppl use,btohqsg
The popular at my area no signo pen,btohqsg
oh pen grips are a good investment oso  i used to find my hand cramping up vv often,btohqsg
put a grip on and i was writing much faster,btohqsg
1.80 and can last for like 2 weeks ish,btohqsg
Ur fingers gonnq hurt anyways  like it compresses inwards,btohqsg
is not handpain from the writing tbh is just,btohqsg
gripping too hard cause keep slipping,btohqsg
