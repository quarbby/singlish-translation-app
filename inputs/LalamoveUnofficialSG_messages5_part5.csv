Because customers smart Liao  they know we will LL move so all select bike rate lor,btohqsg
Unless is oddle they got some algorithm,btohqsg
Yah this is what i think so too. But really too much i felt. I met one guy today and we spoke awhile. I got 2 items (2 location) for driving and he got 3 items (3location) for riding. The rider kp until his box cannot fit. I say u should just feed back rather then u smash inside. But some how he manage to keep all those stuff inside lol,btohqsg
This is crazy lorry will pick aeroplane cargo üòÇ,btohqsg
Feedback no use one lah... once order completed   good luck. U see yesterday discussion some oldbirds got share how to claim,btohqsg
Yeah i read up. Is kind of like the whole thing is in a mass but nobody can do anything about it since is for a living,btohqsg
Got 12k drivers bro. Maybe if 12 rider they will bother lah.,btohqsg
Haha correct  now everyone is just doing for a living only. The rest not so much,btohqsg
Bring a measuring tape and a luggage weighing scale,btohqsg
If item oversized or overweight  tell customer have to upgrade to car or else they will be billed 50 percent of the delivery fee as cancellation fee,btohqsg
For me  I bring along a sling bag which carry the following1) notes2) coins3) 5m measuring tape4) luggage weighing scale,btohqsg
Coins and notes i do. Tape and scale i will do it too. Thanks for advice,btohqsg
I got once took a order for raw satay delivery. 13 pkt of 50 satays. Total about 11kg. customer smoke me less than 8kg.. said other rider got do his job before.  I took Liao  take measuring scale. Took photo and tell him change to car  he agreeFor cash order  do a check in lalamove customer app to see the difference  ask customer top up the difference directly to you in cash then call or email lalamove CS to amend order. Customer can;1) choose to pay you bike fare first  once CS confirm on the price difference  customer have to paynow you back. DO NOT OFFER THE OPTION TO GO BACK COLLECT2)customer can directly top up the difference in cash first then call CS or email them with screenshot to tell them change to carFor credit order  check price difference and inform customer then call or email lalamove CS,btohqsg
For wrong address  either postal code  blk no  unit no  please SMS customer to confirm even after calling him/her. Use your conversation and email to lalamove to claim multinoted surcharge. $3 for bike and $5 for car,btohqsg
Guys  please don't be stupid. A lot of customer and business owner is trying their luck. They know item is oversized or overweight but they just want to offer lowball,btohqsg
üëç thanks for nice advice üòÅ,btohqsg
While I sympathize business owner or customer dealing with thinning margin  I'm concerned my take home money too. So don't be stupid,btohqsg
For late orders  take car park receipt to justifyIf it's HDB and you park along road side  take photo evidence,btohqsg
Lalamove price already like shit especially multiple stops,btohqsg
Even order completed  CS can amend order too. Ask customer to paynow youGive a reasonable time to transfer you. If customer failed to paynow you  lodge a police report then email to lalamove. Lalamove will compensate you,btohqsg
If there is car order  and item require trolley but failed to include in remarks  we driver reserve the rights to cancel,btohqsg
If bike order put trolley required  just go customer place. Take photo evidence on oversized item and ask for cancellations fees,btohqsg
But if lala don't compensate  what can we do...,btohqsg
Most customer will. I met a case where customer Don't want to pay the difference. I lodge a police report as per lalamove CS. They then compensate me. The investigation took a while though,btohqsg
Hopefully that customer account got banned,btohqsg
The lalamove CS nowadays don't even advise. They just say we will call u,btohqsg
Calling them is useless. Some can even argue with you. Fucking no manners,btohqsg
Chase. Just type  hi lalamove team  any updates?,btohqsg
I sometime don‚Äôt even understand what they talking lol than give up calling liao anymore unless really bo bian,btohqsg
You Heng u tio local agent  still ok. You tio tagalore CS  you can jump down,btohqsg
