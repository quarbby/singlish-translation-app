Hi anyone knows if UOB Lady's card max $1000 for 4mpd is on first $1000 or on first eligible $1000? i accidentally credited an ineligible spending to my uob ladys,btohqsg
Cap is on the bonus UNI$ earned so first $1k eligible spend.,btohqsg

Hihi.. is there any good way to invest in real gold? I.e. buying via bank or just go to those jewellery shop to buy actual gold? Just curious which one is better.,btohqsg
buy gold bullion. compare prices and buy at a good price.,btohqsg
Because in overseas is under foreign currency  and does foreign currency is still eligible for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Why not? As long as MCC falls in your chosen category you will get 4mpd  doesn‚Äôt matter how and where you pay.Read the tncs for clearer understanding.,btohqsg
For those who participated in Webull transfer in promotion  please keep an eye on the quarterly fulfillment. I hit issues here and there for both 1st (90 days) and 2nd batch (180 days).Firstly  the first batch of Transfer in reward was not issued automatically  until I contacted Support  they manually requested for me.Now  the second batch of rewards was automatically issued but the amount is wrong. It is supposed to be $600 since I have transferred more than $25k in Feb's promotion but the In-Transit reward amount is only about $200! The amount seems to be the first batch of a lower tier reward.,btohqsg
Uob krisflyer work on specific list of mcc. Amaze just make it online. Mcc stay same. Certain country mcc is like surprise box will either make u happy or stunt,btohqsg
Hi Everyone  youtrip or amaze better for Sydney? For example withdraw from atm at the lowest fees and spend on physical store & restaurant. Thanks!,btohqsg
youtrip for withdrawal at atm  Amaze+crmc for spend,btohqsg
For uob KF onbooking.com  don't use amaze. Amaze will alter transaction description and you won't get 3mpd.,btohqsg
For hotel booking can use amaze right?,btohqsg
not with crmc  Amaze+ uob lady travel category ok,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best e payment app combo,btohqsg
anyone use EGA for car loan? can get the 1%?,btohqsg
If I use amaze + Citi premier miles I won't get any benefits right?,btohqsg
Gotta redo my math but I don't feel like general spend master card + amaze is worth it,btohqsg
If gonna pay at hotel onsite can consider uob vs up to 2 k fcy  uob ppv mobile contactless up to 1.1k,btohqsg
The video says UOB one cc is good for etc mortgage. However  what if the mortgage is more than  $2k? :),btohqsg
Would HSBC EGA giro be a better option?,btohqsg
Hi all   about UOB ladies card  was wondering if the facial clinic that I go to counts as beauty and wellness.NU reflection,btohqsg

Hello all  are the 3mpd miles earn from Krisplus with UOB Krisflyer credited the following month? Or 2 months after card anniversary date?,btohqsg
As my miles credited are not tallying with my spending. I do my calculations Assuming that my monthly miles credited are 1.2mpd.,btohqsg
Kris+ 3mpd is credited the following month.,btohqsg
You mean amaze will make it such that the mcc doesn‚Äôt falls under SIA group related spend?,btohqsg
So just used UOB Kf without amaze on booking ?,btohqsg
Yes if sgd.Non sgd I rather use amaze + Uob lady,btohqsg
Hi  will paynow salary fast tsf for clocking $1.6k uob salary work if i use my own dbs acc (with my name) tsf into my own uob acc (with my name)? Thanks,btohqsg

Yes i did. Does the name of the payee matters? Cos dbs is my name. Then i tsf into my uob acc with my name,btohqsg

Hi! I have $4000 to spend on flights  assuming new to bank  is the SC Journey Card best for sign up promo today? Thank you!,btohqsg
hello anyone knows if can place overnight fd or money market for usd in ibkr ?,btohqsg
"Just hope that UOB dont close this ""loop hole"" like OCBC on salary transfer",btohqsg
Ocbc is probably just 1 off coding error but not intended. UOB is aware of this hack for sure.  I hope they just leave it alone. üòÅ,btohqsg
Overnight fd for private banking client iirc,btohqsg
No. But why not use a card that gives you a decent cashback instead?,btohqsg
Would be a better idea to take out the entire 100k to put into HSBC EGA though ü§≠,btohqsg
That's definitely true. But my tiny brain cmi with HSBC ega and their timing/sms registration,btohqsg
Better to stick to salary crediting  especially if it's easy to DIY.,btohqsg
Including $1 fee is it better than CardUp?,btohqsg
In what cases would UOB privimiles or any other card that offer 2.4mpd fcy be worth it compared to amaze + crmc or amaze + UOB lady‚Äôs?,btohqsg
Hi guys. I am planning to start investing in s&p500 by dollar cost average. What app would be the best to go about it? Anything i should take note of? Thanks,btohqsg
