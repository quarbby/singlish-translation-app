im really satisfied with where im at right now... and when i hear my friend (who got the same nett and raw r5 as me) saying this... ðŸ˜ª,btohqsg
aiya let them enjoy their childhood lah,btohqsg
dude pls say this to my friend whos in vjc ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ hes from that school and thinks of himself as dogshit because he isnt in RI,btohqsg
a very typical scene you will see in almost every neighbourhood,btohqsg
There's always two kinds of jc ppl,btohqsg
One where they think they are never enough  the other think they are way more than capable,btohqsg
there's three kinds of jc ppl:1. submits assignments 14 days late2. submits assignments 14 days early3. submit assignments on the dot just to realise you did the wrong assignment,btohqsg
sg society is so elitist to the point students inculcate such stressful mindset to themselves...,btohqsg
if you dont go express  your life gg.if you go ite  you no future...,btohqsg
i think not just only in sg,btohqsg
ya i know... in other countries the edu system can be way more elitist...,btohqsg
but this is just how the world works  where pre u education is favoured more than vocational schools,btohqsg
what can you do about it,btohqsg
korea is way more worse than China,btohqsg
is like nus ntu to sg,btohqsg
Should show them the story of the guy who went from NT to NA to Express then getting o levels 7 raw,btohqsg
but then theyre gonna say that thats the small minority ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
no way... this guy attained a better score than me for o's ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Well yeah true but at least itâ€™s not impossible,btohqsg
but my friends are fervent that RI is the only good school there is,btohqsg
with that logic i hope he gets into harvard or MIT those kind for uni,btohqsg
they even told me that... hc is worse than ri because hc is ri reject school,btohqsg
yea if he canâ€™t make it i think heâ€™s gonna end it all,btohqsg
because harvard and mit are extremely selective getting in is a matter of luck,btohqsg
MIT I donâ€™t know how many Singaporeans a year enter,btohqsg
nope. some are ri  some are hci  some are ny  then theres me in ej  and the rest vj. i have one from tj and another from acsi,btohqsg
they quite literally have the same cutoff,btohqsg
They probably expect all prospective students to take SAT,btohqsg
and alot of ppl who apply are super qualified so they will choose the ppl that they want,btohqsg
You might see randkmdkd if he comes back right after ns,btohqsg
yep he told me already :'),btohqsg
but i dont want to make my identity known to the world so i wont say much about myself,btohqsg
other than my takes on sg's affairs,btohqsg
yeap. they dont accept a's right? or is it that only oxbridge sees a's and ib?,btohqsg
lets say theres an Asian male basketball player and a Black female dancer. Assume they have exact same academic stats (both 4.0 gpa and 1600 SAT)  exact same achievements   olympiads and research programIf the US uni feels like they need more basketballers  they will choose the Asian. If they think too few black ppl apply to their uni  they will choose the Black girl. So its really a matter of luck,btohqsg
do urself a favour and block him,btohqsg
Oxbridge is more concerned about the grades than anything else,btohqsg
what about holistic wise? not really?,btohqsg
Like if you 4H2 A plus H3 distinction youâ€™d stand a very good chance of entering,btohqsg
UK unis are mostly like that,btohqsg
im just asking for myself because im kinda aiming for oxbridge... since young i've always dreamt of immigration to europe,btohqsg
Afaik MIT is one of the US unis that place more importance on academic achievements? So ur ECs should be more stem oriented like intl oly medals  research progs etc,btohqsg
US Ivy League probably emphasis more on the portfolio,btohqsg
Hmm but I would think they care about non acad results stuff more than UK unis,btohqsg
MIT is one of the best schools that donâ€™t allow for legacy admissions lol,btohqsg
and people canâ€™t just donate their way in,btohqsg
I think theyâ€™re obsessed with H3 tbh,btohqsg
hey i remember my family mentioned this! i heard one of my cousins say that she got rejected from harvard just because her holistic portfolio wasnt stellar... but her SAT scores were adequate for harvard,btohqsg
so h3s are only good for oxbridge?,btohqsg
i mean if you look at the people who get into harvard,btohqsg
