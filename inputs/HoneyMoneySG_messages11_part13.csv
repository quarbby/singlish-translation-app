Hi! Is it worth the effort and fees to get a miles card for cardup payments? If so  which credit card would you all recommend ? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
I am using  UOB Prvi @ 1.4mpd,btohqsg
I‚Äôm into cashback but thinking of getting a miles card just for cardup. Just don't know if worth it...,btohqsg
It's not a bad idea. Get a miles card where the miles don't expire  get their sign up bonus and just use it exclusively for bill payment miles.I'd pick a card with optional annual fees  like DBS Altitude,btohqsg
Will probably take a few years to get enough miles for travel though. Unless you've got some expensive bills,btohqsg
Is there other way to obtain free priority pass to airport lounge other than citibank premiermiles cc ?,btohqsg

what's the lowest cost method to DCA into world index etf/fund with CPFOA?,btohqsg
Hihi   Anyone knows how does tis works ?,btohqsg
Hi I need some advice on my portfolio. Besides the srs dimensional on endowus  I am also currently on syfe custom (qqq  cspx  vwra) and syfe reit+. But I am thinking of moving from syfe to ibkr for the us stocks and to tiger trade for sg reits. Only have $1k per month for investment. Any advice on the allocation? Thanks!,btohqsg
your syfe custom same like mine and i am still lost +- 10% :(,btohqsg
Anyone knows how Tiger Vault works?How to get the advertised 9.9% and what is the optimal amount to put into it?,btohqsg
any recommendations for savings / debit account?,btohqsg
If you want to split between ETF and REITs  maybe you can only focus on one counter for IBKR/Syfe trade + a monthly REIT ETF for $1000,btohqsg
For someone new and who wants to dca using cash into s&p 500  the best way is to do via ibkr due to favourable exchange rates?,btohqsg
For new investors i would feel syfe trade is easier on auto invest feature. Ibkr have to do manual fx conversions and manual place order.,btohqsg
Or webull/moomoo is also good for zero$ trades,btohqsg
Get all the gifts first then decide later,btohqsg
From a cost perspective  ibkr would be cheaper but more hassle due to the manual fx conversion and placing of orders?,btohqsg
Yeaa haha and isit worth it to begin with?,btohqsg
Cheaper for large amounts.Small amounts doesnt matter,btohqsg
I mean if got gifts it's usually worth for the gifts only ü§£ but I dunno if anyone has experimented with it  like what is the optimal amt to put in,btohqsg
