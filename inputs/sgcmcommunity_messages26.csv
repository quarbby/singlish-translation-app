I think the price drop a lot cause I get it in December,btohqsg
But in general from what I've heard  EV insurance tends to be higher compared to the ICE counterparts based on the fact that there are essentially very few places to fix the cars and with the instant torque and slightly different driving dynamics  they expect a few more mishaps to happen as drivers get used to them like the ones that have been taking place with the mg5 taxis,btohqsg
The mg5 is reckless driving and is not even a performance car,btohqsg
Give him any car also crash,btohqsg
agreed  but having all that power under your right foot  insurance companies probably see the higher risk,btohqsg
and they don't have a very accurate way of judging one's driving patterns apart from their record which is not too accurate either as you can be reckless and get away with it a lot and do out of insurance settlements,btohqsg
Ya other factor like tyre brake and saftly system also come into place   but in the hands of reckless driving result is same,btohqsg
here's how you can pay the 5000 dollars insurance free!,btohqsg
ugly sinkie all exposed in malaysia,btohqsg
Nothing specialJB has the most wanted criminal. Some SingaporeanIf you remember a Singaporean Ferrari driver was stabbed when he horn a Mercedes blocking him.,btohqsg
He paid already.Many behave like Angel in Singapore.Go over  to Malaysia  transform😂,btohqsg
mlysia is pay first then can pump leh,btohqsg
they allow me to fill up first. some of them,btohqsg
but sinkies should not do this,btohqsg
Some petrol station never lock.Like petron beside KSL can pump first before paying. Not sure now.Petronas and shell outside custom and before must pay first,btohqsg
no. some dont if yoou request to fill up first.,btohqsg
but this is besides the point  users got to demonstrate honesty,btohqsg
i sometimes request them to let me fill up first. then pay. why? because dont know how much it will be,btohqsg
and they comply with my request. they trust that i would pay later. must not lose that trust.,btohqsg
of course there are many who  after so many such incients  would want you to pay first,btohqsg
I always pay more.Pump finished then  go counter change.Or the pump attendant standing around will return the change to me. They hold alot of cash😝,btohqsg

Fuel prices will cascade down to everything we purchase. Inflation will hit us very hard and for those who’s salary is not raising fast enough  effectively it’s a lost in a few percentage or more of their income. That’s why Singaporean are crazy Liao!

I would recommend getting a specialist workshop to do a PPI in any case  it'll be the most comprehensive as they know what issues to look for in the specific car you are purchasing. The sgcm warranty can be something you get after the deal is almost done too,btohqsg

Thanks. Any recommendation of such specialist workshop?,btohqsg
what car are you looking at?,btohqsg
I'm looking at some A-B kind of SUV  Vezel (or HRV)  Nissan QQ  Tucson. Apparently on SGCM  there are more choices on Bezel.,btohqsg
Just noticed some dealer put that SGCM warranty logo in the Ads  most are not. Also similar for STA logo,btohqsg
I presume when they put the logo there  the inspection has already been done?,btohqsg
ya need submit sta inspection cert if want put t hat,btohqsg
for sgcm i presume is in house inspection,btohqsg
STA and SGCM inspection are good for a base level of security and give you details on some wear and tear and information on any accidents or anomalies with the car,btohqsg
Can consider some places on this list  but you would have to make sure if the dealer allows for an independent workshop inspection first,btohqsg
if don't allow immediate red flag,btohqsg
"For example this one  it indicates ""protected by sgcm warranty""",btohqsg
I kena puke and diarrhea from puppy. On my clothes 😂👍,btohqsg
Some suggest only STA or vicom as it'll be unbiased which is fair at times as well. But if they don't allow anything  best to walk away,btohqsg
For the inspection under sgCarMart Warranty  we will naturally do an extensive check of the car to ensure the car is in a healthy condition.The check will be done using original diagnositic tools from the manufacturer to ensure the car health status.We are unable to compare our check with STA or AA as they are only an evaluation test. Even if you pass their inspections  you will not be eligible for sgCarMart Warranty until your clear our checks.,btohqsg

does that mean the below one has already done the sgcm warranty inspection check?,btohqsg
Inspection happens after the purchase as mentioned here,btohqsg
It means it's eligible for 6-months warranty. So when you decide to purchase the car  tell your used car dealer you want sgCarMart Warranty and they will activate it for you,btohqsg

Mr Xun is an avid lover of ICE powertrains,btohqsg

but the 80k diff how to offset? i think 10yrs down the road also cannot,btohqsg

Will be intreasting to see what the policy will be next time on such,btohqsg
you dont like the glorious scream from the 5 cyl?,btohqsg
And the AD knows that Volvo is planning to go all electric in a few years so they are trying to earn for as long as they can,btohqsg
Wearnes is known for their high margins on Volvos anyway as mentioned by Mr Xun earlier,btohqsg
so you know what that means right.Less maintenance means higher margin,btohqsg
This is one true driver. He did this many years ago to Tibet,btohqsg
It’s for rich people who must have Volvos,btohqsg
The car was on sale a while back I believe. I don't think he ended up selling it,btohqsg
Really uses it to the fullest of its capabilities,btohqsg
With that number on the dash  I think best just keep 😂,btohqsg
It’s a collectors at that point,btohqsg
He transformed the car into a 4s heelDrive capable of doing  river crossing.,btohqsg

But I like the old T850R looks,btohqsg
honestly i love volvo styling all the way,btohqsg
smtimes abit quirky but i dig it,btohqsg
different strokes for different folks i guess,btohqsg
How about this one Mr Xun?,btohqsg
I love wagons too and felt they’re all beautiful.. until I realise there are some not as beautiful ones like this one.,btohqsg
This one can put 5 dogs,btohqsg
Don’t like that lah.. Mr Xun is actually a nice guy.,btohqsg
The new model 3 performance road tax also increase,btohqsg

They are made in Sweden China US Belgium,btohqsg
aiyo bmw also made in china,btohqsg
china is good if they ensure proper quality control,btohqsg
It will be a matter of time before most cars are made in china,btohqsg
Fortunately Mazda is made in japan.,btohqsg
Made in China made in japan made in germany made in sweden got difference one meh😂😂 different hemisphere the metal react differently ah...most of the cars arent even handmade😵‍💫😋,btohqsg
Haha. If made in Malaysia you wouldn’t say that.,btohqsg
LOL i dont really care where it is made honestly... it can be made in Germany and still come with huge panel gaps. If a malaysia factory can ensure proper quality control then im fine w it,btohqsg
buy Hyundai EV . will be made in Singapore soon. with pride😂,btohqsg
workers mostly still from mlysia I guess haha,btohqsg
When’s the factory up and running,btohqsg
I still don’t understand why Hyundai chose singapore. Expensive place,btohqsg
We got world class talent and infrastructure ok,btohqsg
Depends on which series I think sir,btohqsg
ur tesla also made in china?,btohqsg
china quality control for Model 3 is so much btr compared to US,btohqsg
i seldom if not dont even see obvious panel gaps,btohqsg
I don’t know cause I never own a us tesla before haha,btohqsg
u got see US made Model S before?,btohqsg
TOSG pres model S some panel gaps are quite big,btohqsg
Ya no issue from what I see but heng suay 1 la,btohqsg
Now actually Simi sai also made in China,btohqsg
Even is made in Germany a lot of parts are made in China,btohqsg
But their exquisite item standard might not be there,btohqsg
ang mor underestimated the learning power of PRC.. they only set up factories there for  cheap labor. never expecting that Chinese could one day learn n outsmart them in technology ...,btohqsg
Have you been to a car plant tour? I’ve seen many rejects of welded car bodies in VW plant in USA.  I’m Shocked. They’re chucked in a corner. Robots welded wrong or something.,btohqsg
No never haha I am not a really car person,btohqsg
I mean I don’t go to such extend haha,btohqsg
But I might visit the giga factory,btohqsg
I arranged a plant tour for many in Chattanooga usa seeing VW assembling Passat. So many rejects. Shocking. I secretly took photos. From car rams,btohqsg
Haha yes actually! volvo's plant in Sweden (obviously)😂😂. but volvo's plant was relatively smooth! i was more impressed by the speed each car was made,btohqsg
Hello Shifus  can anyone help advise if the number of owners matter when it comes to the trade in value next time? Thanks!,btohqsg
I see.. do you know whats the rough difference in value? Like if 1 owner vs 2 owner  would it be around 1k diff or more?,btohqsg
That’s negligible la. Unless it’s like 4 5 owners,btohqsg
Mileage more important than owners.. sometimes people feels a car is a lemon if too many owners..Many sports cars are of many owners and value holds well..Trade in value usually not affected.. if it’s a private sale.. harder to find buyer.. price not that much different..,btohqsg
The more numbers of transfer means more excuses for the next buyer to cut pricing lah.,btohqsg
can you modify your wheel to yoke type wheel?,btohqsg
Driving tester cant penalise for not holding 2 and 10 o clock position,btohqsg
haha do they always have such rules? 10-10,btohqsg
and another hand holding toothpick to clean his teeth!,btohqsg
And the yoke is only nice on the model s due to the display screen,btohqsg
how is that? LTA must approve?,btohqsg
try first. if not approved take out,btohqsg
Will kana a letter and ask u to remove if caught,btohqsg
Aiya. Just a letter. Not fine.,btohqsg
Trade in likely no issue as most dealers will offer you paper value + body value + slight premium. They care more about the condition and mileage,btohqsg

anyway  got to give it to musk. he really is a brilliant engineer who looks far ahead,btohqsg
Mazda  was never a very popular car  even overseas.,btohqsg
small company small sales. family controlled,btohqsg
i always wonder. if tesla wants to reduce price to sell and yeat make a margin  shouldn't this mean Ford and GMs and others would be pressured  considering they use advertising and dealership that spends a lot. and i read Ford is quietly moving away from dealership model,btohqsg
typo sorry. i cut and past,btohqsg
I think he is in a Tesla mode today,btohqsg
Mazda has its die-hard followers. i hear of one family buying all 3 cars and all mazdas,btohqsg
Why u bother about Ford? They not even in Sg anymore,btohqsg
I don't think ford and GM will be pressured until Tesla and other manufacturers are able to make EVs that can rival their trucks such as the f150 and Silverado with the same capabilities or big sized SUVs like the escalade or explorer  etc.,btohqsg
All brands have their die hard followers,btohqsg
Tesla if cheap is not Tesla anymore,btohqsg
Who wants to buy cheap stuff??? Surely not the mighty Singaporeans,btohqsg
haha i dont think so... only rival from ford wld be the mustang machE,btohqsg
they will be pressured. time will come. shift will come,btohqsg
Honestly what’s the value of the new car salesman?,btohqsg
ford mustang will have to cut price if faced with price pressure. and if they cut  it means margin will be eroded. that is why Ford id quietly building a special division,btohqsg
i think people who love the mustang wont buy a tesla haha  world of difference,btohqsg
because this is difficult to move away form dealership model  they got to find some ways to do it. dealership association in usa is a big business. can get sued,btohqsg
Me.. l like to buy cheap stuff. . Sell me Tesla model X for $100k with coe included… I straight away buy,btohqsg
you never know.  people can change. never say never,btohqsg
yeah im pretty sure they buy it for the big old V8,btohqsg
Why Tesla don’t hv convertible? I thought amdk like convertible,btohqsg
It will diminish for mass market cars at some point for sure. But coachbuilt cars  exotic cars with major spec options and used car dealers will still be around,btohqsg
slowly but surely. pressure is mounting.,btohqsg
i really like the cybertruck style. futuristic. headsturners,btohqsg
"Here's where the ""pressure"" is going",btohqsg
Dealers are getting supply of cars  many with full lots and have the liberty of charging super high markups while people continue to buy,btohqsg
Supply shortages have created this ready stock markup bubble,btohqsg
hah i know. i walked to several dealerships in oakland in 2003. they pressured me. i went to see the beloved honda s2000. only usd30500. but hell they pressured me to buy,btohqsg
Even Tesla's own ready stock has markups,btohqsg
No. i wriggle my way out. i sensed the pressure i did not want to test drive the car.,btohqsg
good agility! so you bought an MX5?,btohqsg
i got bored. i rented a car to drive around to check out cars  as i am a car fan. then i went to see their car shows. damn lousy. no comparisons with the german show,btohqsg
"Sorry but how does this relate to the d2c and ""pressure on dealers"" (doesn't seem to exist if they're minting money with markups) conversation",btohqsg
in a different time  i went to check out toyota mrs. yeash that one we tested the car. good sporty car. because he is american  he is clever to find ways to fend off sales tactics,btohqsg
wow mrs  beautiful mid engine rwd car. perfect car for the tight touges,btohqsg
it is to illustrate tactics. like high markups etc. better not let them know you buy using cash  they never like that,btohqsg
the sales people are very intimidating in general.,btohqsg
the sales manager in oakland honda sales office is a Chinese American. super aggressive. you know like time sales kind of tactics,btohqsg
ok rain has stopped. what should i do>?,btohqsg

Will singapore one day do away with dealers,btohqsg
It takes one brand to do it first. Others will follow. Singapore style.,btohqsg
Now that Tesla has done it well. Hyundai to follow next?,btohqsg

U need to set up office like what tesla did in sg,btohqsg
But since Hyundai already got a factory seems to be easy for them,btohqsg
Traction control off. Fastest shift times in M mode.,btohqsg
Where is the 7th bar sir?,btohqsg
Then turn on traction control but M changes to MDM mode. It’s really complex. I think mdm  mode means computer control,btohqsg
I made a mistake. It’s at 6 bars. Default 5 bars.,btohqsg
Here’s where you manually turn it on to 6 bars max,btohqsg
That M mode is very enjoyable. Everything sharpens up. Throttle control much more responsive. Steeling taut feel suspension firmer dct shifts faster. Fuel use is also faster! 😢,btohqsg
Like traction control on but still allows you to have a bit of fun without killing you?,btohqsg
But the acceleration is simply superb. Ultimate,btohqsg
It bears the m3 badge for good reason 👍🏼 👍🏼,btohqsg

You should just 6 then jump down to 4,btohqsg

Haiyah but what do I know,btohqsg
I only talk from playing Forza,btohqsg

Italian cars. Full of characters. Alfa zagatto Lancia Bugatti etc,btohqsg

wasn't he french but born in Italy,btohqsg
He’s a very intelligent engineer. Talented young man who showed his skills in France.,btohqsg
Yes. He later converted to French because of time spent there,btohqsg
I admire Italians for originality. Ideas are never plagiarized. Style is original. Each brand has its own style and beauty.,btohqsg
He converted much later after world war.,btohqsg
the brand itself was founded in Molsheim which was part of Germany and then France though,btohqsg
Today the same leaders like Elon musk are also engineers.,btohqsg
My personal favorites would be the gated manual 360 modena  458 and murcielago sv,btohqsg
of course there's also the mc12 and f40 in there as well,btohqsg
how about dark history of volkswagen,btohqsg
Maserati is absolutely gorgeous. I remember seeing the boomerang rear light GT3200 in Germany. It’s so unique and from far it’s instantly recognizable Maserati. Beautiful.,btohqsg
Then there is the modest Alfa 156 with rear hidden door handle that looks like a 2 door coupe. And so many other makers copy the design today. Ideas and beauty to original comes from Italy.,btohqsg
But in sg the dash board will melt,btohqsg
Did you know the Alfa 156 card can park free in tangs and Guthrie building in bukit timah?,btohqsg
New model I don’t know thou and the maintenance is woo Lala,btohqsg
Haha. I managed to park so many times free. How? The stupid parking scammer can’t detect the number plates.,btohqsg
