hi  i hv a qn. if the annual fee has been waived off but it is on next month‚Äôs statement do i pay off this amount which has the annual fee included or do i just pay off the amount excluding?,btohqsg
For GXS they mentioned in the t&c that max capped at 75k inside saving pocket in order to get the 3.48% interest. I‚Äôm wondering if i transferred in exactly 75k  then the next day‚Äôs interest add up will exceed the limit  does it mean the interest forfeited? Or the interest will still be given to me just that the earned interest will not earn any compounding interest the day after?,btohqsg
No. At least this is what I understand from my prior annual fees which are waived,btohqsg
so i just pay off the amt excluding?,btohqsg
Anyone knows how long it takes for GXS account to be activated? I applied on Last Thu.,btohqsg
Mine took like 2 hours. I applied via Singpass,btohqsg
Instant for me when applied via SingPass directly,btohqsg
I applied still no account number. üò¢,btohqsg
Did you get an email from them saying you'll hear from them soo,btohqsg
Ya rec on Thu. Until now,btohqsg
Yes. That‚Äôs for uob (disclaimer)  not sure abt the other banks,btohqsg
No for both. Interest will be credited and compounded.,btohqsg
you are right. so the actual interest is even higher when you let the interest and savings compound.,btohqsg
By allowing the full amount to accumulate interest on a daily basis in your Savings Pocket  you have the opportunity to earn an effective interest rate of more than 3.48% per annum on GXS.For example  keeping $1000 in a savings pocket without withdrawal of interest will earn you $35.40 of interest after 365 days.This is equivalent to 3.54% p.a.@gxssg,btohqsg
Did you switch on vpn when apply? If yes  try switch it off and try apply again.,btohqsg
I emailed them and they said overwhelmed so delayed,btohqsg
My wife and I applied for the GXS. She got the account approved immediately whereas mine is under processing,btohqsg
Same as my gf..she approved in less than 8 hrs and I am still pending,btohqsg
I just downloaded the app. And registered. Everything is settled and approved immediately in less than 5 mins.,btohqsg
