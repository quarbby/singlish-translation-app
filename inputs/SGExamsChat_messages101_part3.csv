no need talk about gov decision,btohqsg
Even if it's beneficial to conscript females,btohqsg
they wont  there'll be backlash from other countries  at most they'll employ propaganda,btohqsg
It doesn't make a difference if they aren't,btohqsg
ur argument about streaming doesnt directly translate over to ns,btohqsg
and the argument of backlash can be used for ANY change,btohqsg
so there would be no change if theres good merit to that argument,btohqsg
I remember this grp had no politica rule,btohqsg
singapore alr has negative rep w regards to being authoritarian  imagine making babies being compulsory,btohqsg
Must be in an alt dimension,btohqsg
Lose votes from female voters ah,btohqsg
Not even China has done that,btohqsg
never did say make baby compulsory,btohqsg
u think all males want baby meh,btohqsg
One is wnuf to rule the world,btohqsg
But suffer short pain now better than delay until the future,btohqsg
The world dun deserve more Neils,btohqsg
Changing the presidency caused a backlash,btohqsg
One is wnuf to rule em all,btohqsg
so its not a fairness argument but a utilitarian one,btohqsg
then it might be the case that implementing zabo ns nothing happen,btohqsg
cant post hoc decide whether a change is good right,btohqsg
Ik a lot who want to serve,btohqsg
Well as a wise man once said,btohqsg
Not arguing whether it's fair or not,btohqsg
Sacrifice of one opens up choices and opportunities for others,btohqsg
need to establish cause effect relationship,btohqsg
Maybe pap scared to lose erection,btohqsg
John is a xmm and he enlisted,btohqsg
"the ""since this has always been the case  it cant be otherwise"" argument is very bad leh",btohqsg
Basically what I feel is that for any change to be instituted  it needs to be beneficial enough,btohqsg
I don't see the point of enlisting females,btohqsg
Is there anyth wrong with that,btohqsg
ur argument is based on theres no marginal increase in utility for zabo to be in ns,btohqsg
lets back up all the way to the start when no policy was made,btohqsg
how would it be/not be beneficial to have zabo in ns,btohqsg
Because you could be the one getting plowed,btohqsg
from nothing to something surely theres some marginal benefit,btohqsg
Maybe if u go thru gp lessons in JC,btohqsg
Ull realise whatever ur typing here,btohqsg
Yep at this point they could have enlist females,btohqsg
Is on the interesting side of a spectrum,btohqsg
since the atrition rate for ns is so high,btohqsg
its basically changing the entire cohort every 2 years,btohqsg
it could very well be a good time to enlist zabo,btohqsg
theres no precursor to stop or prevent marginal increases in utility,btohqsg
I see  and enlist woman then more deterrence towards neighbours lol,btohqsg
It's still the same attrition rate with double the manpower  but okay sure,btohqsg
the moment i see utility i think of econs,btohqsg
yeah double the manpower is cos u already presume that guys must do,btohqsg
