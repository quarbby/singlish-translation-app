In a monthly strategy report  the research team noted that Mr Biden is likely to end the United States' trade war with the EU  and adopt a more open and negotiable approach with China with  tariffs being reconsidered or removed.The easing of US-China trade tensions will also be positive for China's recovery and should lift sentiment for China-related stocks on the Singapore bourse such as China Aviation Oil (CAO) and Hutchison Port Holdings Trust (HPH Trust)  the analysts added.They highlighted that CAO derives 60-65 per cent of profits from the Shanghai international airport's aviation fuel services  which will benefit from a strong rebound in domestic air travel. HPH Trust  meanwhile  gets some 90 per cent of its profits from Yantian Port  where 30 per cent of the business are exports to the US.DBS views one of the key beneficiaries of a second term for Mr Trump to be oil and gas players with exposure in the US.Another term for the President may be positive for Singapore-listed oil service providers in the US  such as CSE Global  the research team said  adding that Keppel Corp could see increased demand for rigs and vessels with a deregulation of the energy industry and a lift to drilling activities.,btohqsg
