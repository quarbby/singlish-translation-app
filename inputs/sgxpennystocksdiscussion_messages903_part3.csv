Since we are nearing the end of the February results month  starting to watch Mencast more closely.Results should be out latest by this coming Thursday or earlier.Based on recent HY  extrapolating it  the FY should end with approx $6m net profit.However  IMO seems there should be growth in the 2nd half and the net profit should be higher.With that  if we are fortunate enough  the dividends issuance might restart ? It‚Äôs a possibility considering that they were consistently paying out dividends every year from 2009 to 2015 before oil prices crashed and affected O&G companies.Anyways  with oil prices being quite steady  profitability should continue andFingers crossed that they will reward shareholders with dividends.DYODD,btohqsg
Mencast past dividends Yield from 2009 to 2015 for reference.Fingers crossed ü§û that management might restart giving out dividends on this FY23 which should be profitable.Added $0.036 recently. Seems pivot. I believe this gamble should rewardDYODD,btohqsg

Yoma Strategicüöß‚Ä¢ pivot point is at 0.05.‚Ä¢ preference: the downside prevails as long as 0.05 is resistance.‚Ä¢ Alternative scenario: the upside breakout of 0.05 would call for 0.053 and 0.055.Comment: the RSI is trading below 30. This could mean that either the stock is in a lasting downtrend or just oversold and that therefore a rebound could shape (look for bullish divergence in this case). The MACD is negative and below its signal line. The configuration is negative. Moreover  the share stands below its 20 and 50 day moving average (respectively at 0.0537 and 0.0639).Supports:0.0490.042,btohqsg

ThaiBevüêòüç∫: the upside prevails as long as 0.51 is support or pivot point‚Ä¢ Alternative scenario: below 0.51  expect 0.49 and 0.48.Comment: the RSI is above 50.
