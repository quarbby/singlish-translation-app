i waiting for someone named nicole to rename herself to conicole flask,btohqsg
seab was js seabitch during sci prac,btohqsg
gave the pure one to combine,btohqsg
i always do well for titration,btohqsg
but the p2 was damn ez,btohqsg
yes  but yt can get 100,btohqsg

another one   the vector is (3   1  -2) but i wrote ( 3   - 1   2),btohqsg
that's the most hype I've ever seen u,btohqsg
guess wat@biology_is_trashhas fallen into pocoyo cult,btohqsg

My teacher said ‚Äúknow about stuff‚Äù,btohqsg
But when I search on google it‚Äôs a diff thing I don‚Äôt understand,btohqsg
i just think of emotional maturity as knowing how to handle and carry themselves,btohqsg
or like good EQ i guess,btohqsg
idk they can use whatever term they want ig,btohqsg
can someone briefly explain to me what‚Äôs the difference between double pure science and combined science ?,btohqsg
is double pure sci very stressful?,btohqsg
at least for physics its damn ez,btohqsg
ik but which one is more manageable? i‚Äôm not sure which one i should take,btohqsg
fewer topics + easier to pass in general,btohqsg
I think common requirement for  sci stream in JC is A1 comb sci or something,btohqsg
Unless JC isn't your goal then you have to see your diploma,btohqsg
generally  many people take pute.. I don't have much say for this because I take comb.for comb  id say it can be equally stressful. pure vs combined- pure is a subject alone  combined is joined tgt. so let's say that ur chemistry is better  then it'll greatly affect ur phy/bio grade.. esp if you wan go jc.. imagine your chem A1 but ur bio is B4 or so  then there goes your chance of going sci stream jc. if I'm not wrong  pure and comb have same number of lessons per week  this cld mean  pure- lessons more rushed since there's more chapters  but usually pure sci classes have extra classes after school,btohqsg
to add on  people in combined science learn less as compared to pure science  which explains why pure science lessons are generally more rushed as mentioned above,btohqsg
not sure how many chapters per se  though,btohqsg
My school actually pure got more lessons,btohqsg
And pure sci class usually the one that are released later,btohqsg
comb sci is around 70% of pure sci syllabus,btohqsg
Pure sci and humanities get extra lesson,btohqsg
I mean they have more extra classes but not sure if it's optional class or remedial,btohqsg
I don't have..... mines only remedial bcz I suck at geog#slayy,btohqsg
For me pure sci got more curriculum time,btohqsg
ok I'm saying for my sch  all sch diff,btohqsg
@s4nc7uaryuw u can check w ur snrs,btohqsg
My Geog was like 6 period a week iirc,btohqsg
Is it worth it taking h2 geog just cos you love pure geog,btohqsg
but got 2 hour lessons lo,btohqsg
Kinda want to go jc mostly because of h2 geog,btohqsg
Cos what if im in jc then idl geog already,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs ideal in jc,btohqsg
Yea just don‚Äôt take h2 Geog,btohqsg
Or rlly think about it again if uw do a llv,btohqsg
but can be very easy once you understand,btohqsg
Yes especially if you don‚Äôt take amath,btohqsg
even for me I took A math.,btohqsg
H2 math can still be a challenge.,btohqsg
and u are expected to form your own strategy.H2 math is like swimming inside the ocean. and have to endure 3h of pain,btohqsg
is like your parents hold you while you ride a bicycle.but for H2 math  you are on your own riding your own bicycle.the same concept. let say like Maximum and minimum.but A math is alot more guided.than H2 math is I take out some information then you are expected to do it by yourself.,btohqsg
idk sia later I go see aHahaha,btohqsg
wa brah first time ure not going to disturb me for 3 hours üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
I will spent all the 3h,btohqsg
+ scratching ur head like wtf is going on hor,btohqsg
i will bang bang the table,btohqsg
eh wtf I tot u old fuck,btohqsg
u not very young alr also,btohqsg
well. Are you 16? no. ah  old.,btohqsg
16 year old pocoyo alr Liao,btohqsg
asking her to wish u gl yesyes,btohqsg
Bedok is js a scammer in general,btohqsg
I receive the prayer msg from here.,btohqsg
Yk if u tag him he'll always sudd js appear,btohqsg
My guy is getting a 100,btohqsg
I think he in exam hall alr,btohqsg
and den his phone keep vibrating,btohqsg
yea cause sc is need to like go in earlier,btohqsg
see u all in 3 hours,btohqsg
then y u take h2 geog üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
doesnt matter how nice the subj is  studying for exams wld make u dislike it,btohqsg
that's the reason combi sci is most bo hua,btohqsg
imagine study 140% for pure sci for only 1 grade,btohqsg
yes u need ur rest for tmrws paper,btohqsg
it's not as hard. It builds on A Maths foundation.Any weak links in A Maths will cause trouble in H2 Math.,btohqsg
1st half do paper2nd half redo it,btohqsg
yes üíîüíî den go jc still need A1 ü§¨ü§¨,btohqsg
I ever had a pure physics student  chemistry was F9  physics was B4 at prelimsThe school asked her to drop to combined sci ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
let's say comb he get 6 den phy abt same same den end up get 5 for one subj,btohqsg
ya lor. Schools sometimes no time to look at individual students to give the best way forward,btohqsg
she ended up staying in Pure?p,btohqsg
I calculated for her  best case B3 for combined sci but worst case B3 if just take physics,btohqsg
drop also no point  if chem is f9 means basic fundamentals also dh means comb sci also cannot do wot...,btohqsg
it's just basic things that makes sense,btohqsg
it's a generally IP sch that has O level track,btohqsg
but I think prelims and O level time the teachers no time and energy to sieve through her stuff to think through,btohqsg
the inviligilation duties can be quite taxing,btohqsg
but then also  dropping right bfr olvls is q risky.. student wouldn't know what is tested or not  not used to the rigour of the sci pprs,btohqsg
bcz sci pprs can be q repetitive  if the student continuously do pprs from 2 months prior olvls. sure can A at least B3,btohqsg
you are so much more clear headed than the teacher who advised her,btohqsg
hi guys  may you all help me to fill this quick survey,btohqsg
@lolreallyysurveys only allowed on our discord under our dedicated surveys channel,btohqsg
Hi I can just say for my sch laEach pure sci have 3 hrs of lesson per week,btohqsg
Pure humans also 3hr per week,btohqsg
Electives have 1hr 40 mins of lesson time per week,btohqsg
Imo the pacing was q ok,btohqsg
U definitely need to do review,btohqsg
It's not as scary as ppl make it seem to be and if u like sci in gen rly just go for it,btohqsg
what happens if we skip chi paper 2,btohqsg
ya but honestly idk why i retake eh i passed already,btohqsg
Cuz this exams grade considered void,btohqsg
my chi has been bad all the while la but i don‚Äôt think i can do better this time,btohqsg
I think my Cher said they just take the btr one,btohqsg
so if i skip then totally voided is it,btohqsg
bcs i heard some say they will do moderation,btohqsg
Iirc seab policy is if no valid reason,btohqsg
The moment u skip 1 paper,btohqsg
wah okayü•≤ my sign to go and js anyhow do i guess,btohqsg
ya cos idt i can do better this time lol probably worse,btohqsg
harh wtf how long is one lesson mines 1hr interval,btohqsg
I mean bcz you're used to it ah... sec2 to 3 might be a lil diff,btohqsg
My sch timetable is by 20 mins block,btohqsg
So some classes r 40 mins,btohqsg
our h2 math kiddos are done?,btohqsg
I was rly scared as shit,btohqsg
But for me it got easier in urrr,btohqsg
well for me  I was consistent.. consistent in slacking  but combined was q easy to pick up again in the last 6 months so üëçüèº,btohqsg
i till now also very consistent,btohqsg
but i work hard when needed aye,btohqsg
Just that it's gonna be abit more cancer...,btohqsg
bro i flunked o lvls bro,btohqsg
But generally still am pro pure sci,btohqsg
i one stupid fuck buy 2 bio tys  did both  and like can do everything so üôèüôè,btohqsg
HUH NO I BOUGHT TWO OF THE SAME COMBINED TYS,btohqsg
bcz I was that slack I didn't know what I had what I didn't,btohqsg
BUT I ACCI BOUGHT A PURE CHEM BOOK,btohqsg
AND I JS FOHND OUT YST,btohqsg
THE SCARIEST PART IS I GOT MAJORITY CORRECT,btohqsg
Just heck care abt electrolysis and,btohqsg
I was looking I was like eh this not tested what,btohqsg
ok just saying from what I heard,btohqsg
Yai was like wtf is this,btohqsg
Even if u use pure knowledge to do,btohqsg
wear glasses still cannot see properly ah,btohqsg
then rly need to do sth about it,btohqsg
dw i wear specs also :),btohqsg
Chemical bonding: Giant covalent and giant metallicMole: empirical formula  back titrationPeriodic table: transition metalEnergy changes: energy profile diagram  calculation of ‚àÜH  catalystSpeed of reaction: catalystMetals: thermal decomposition of carbonatesElectrolysisAmmoniaOrganic ChemistryThis is the diff between comb chem and pure chem where comb dun learn all thisNA: intro/alkane/alkenecomb: intro/alkane/alkene/alcohol/carboxylic acid  polymer of alkenepure: intro/alkane/alkene/alcohol/carboxylic acid/ester  polymer of alkene/ester/amide,btohqsg
But yeah these stuff u can heck care@itchybqckside,btohqsg
u also got ur combine sci paper hello,btohqsg
Which paper is the morning paper,btohqsg
Hello people who don't take Chinese,btohqsg
scarly tmr@itchybqcksidehappily report to sch at 1+ in the afternoon üòÇ,btohqsg
how'd u do for mid yr,btohqsg
Wait is he the politician that says vote for ___  THUMBS UP  vote for ___ BOOOOOOOOOO,btohqsg
Does anyone have sec 3 math textbook,btohqsg
Can I take a look at the content page,btohqsg
wat my paper afternoon no meh,btohqsg
Paiseh if not clear my cam sucks,btohqsg
i tink is just telegram haha,btohqsg
telegram the camera damn bad one  but v little space,btohqsg
damn pre Uni textbooks actually tried to make it look less tedious to read,btohqsg
as in it‚Äôs not just a sea of text to filter through,btohqsg
nah  wanted to check the difference between NA and EX content,btohqsg
she said she only learn new topic in sec 5  never revisit sec 3-4 stuff,btohqsg
My sis wanna go exp sci,btohqsg
Assuming approval from hod + her S2 cher,btohqsg
I'm amused cuz she doesn't rly seem like the science type,btohqsg
O level syallbus taught in 3 years,btohqsg
Anyw if the exp na gap not that big....,btohqsg
Then ig I can kinda see why,btohqsg
Cuz maths is one of those subjs thats rly,btohqsg
IK IT SOUNDS DAMN NONSENSE TO OUTSIDERS,btohqsg
"How nonsense ahFor sch days ahSome day 1.20/1.40 (the somewhat normal one)  got 2+ (also acceptable) 3+ (sadge but can suck up) and the ""favourite"" 4.20/4.40 dismissal",btohqsg
Btw it's 7.30 start except weds 8.30 start,btohqsg
And there's CCA and hw on top.,btohqsg
From what I can tell  it‚Äôs quite a big jump like you‚Äôve got maybe 25% of the o level content to cover and getting them up to the higher rigour,btohqsg
so the time to push up their earlier stuff is not a lot,btohqsg
ok la we alw joke abt how my sch timetable is prep us for jc,btohqsg
This is smth even the lower sec exp,btohqsg
It's not a upper sec problem,btohqsg
Even lower sec end 4+ 1 day a week,btohqsg
Every other week they alt betw,btohqsg
Got some Chinese reading lesson or smth,btohqsg
But no one gave a shit,btohqsg
Aiya they give it a nice name but it's basically compulsory via,btohqsg
But ya I see if I can dig my S2 timetable,btohqsg
Oh the new timetable less cheebai than back in my day lmao,btohqsg
Yes odd and even week exist,btohqsg

Art alw piss me off cuz focus on visual arts,btohqsg
I literally can do Photoshop and shit,btohqsg
my time table used to look like that,btohqsg
I feel the higher u go on the education ladder,btohqsg
The less packed ur time table gets,btohqsg
I rmb I had a shock,btohqsg
When I first saw their timetable,btohqsg
"""wthell y'all can end at 12.40 on a non Friday?""",btohqsg
It's either- some assembly- Chers need give out some survey or presentation,btohqsg
If neither my Chers policy is u do what u want,btohqsg
My class ppl usu just mug,btohqsg
No matter what combi u take,btohqsg
What do u think will happen,btohqsg
Not everyone take in upper sec,btohqsg
Cuz right the ppl who take o level drama,btohqsg
Upper sec its either o level drama,btohqsg
Me same combi without Phys alrd shitting tears eh,btohqsg

Ppl need to learn how to manage mild stress,btohqsg
Just pushing it ain't gonna do shiet,btohqsg
Ofc that still needs to be addressed but,btohqsg
Cheebai if u wanna continue using acad cert u jolly well make sure the students r sufficiently prepared la,btohqsg
Now I sound like a yp,btohqsg
exams are like the biggest thing to get students to study,btohqsg
Ok la this one like fr depends on who also,btohqsg
and if academics causes students to have so many issues  it‚Äôs usually cos of certain expectations from others or themselves,btohqsg
Eh idky I heard via my sis ah,btohqsg
I mean even if they do want to reduce stress,btohqsg
Literally got rumours of who fucked and stuff,btohqsg
My theory is they just wanna seem like they got do smth,btohqsg
I don't rly hear this kind one,btohqsg
