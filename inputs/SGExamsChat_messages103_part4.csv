had to google what diplomacy was in chinese,btohqsg
China Studies was fun for me  but Iâ€™m not sure about the perspective coming from a Geog background.,btohqsg
It was fun to see the battle of ideologies manifesting in the present,btohqsg
Fun in retrospect  hell in the process.,btohqsg
Bedok  what is the combi youâ€™re imagining with CSC in it?,btohqsg
U rather take csc than phy arh,btohqsg
I believe phy dist rate is way higher than csc though,btohqsg
i tot csc alot of chines students take,btohqsg
u want compete with them meh,btohqsg
alot of the chinese friends i have after taking csc changed their views about taiwan,btohqsg
sg tends to give a more balanced view of what happened between them than the ideological/dogmatic way of teaching in china,btohqsg
the view that taiwan is china's and taiwanese are dumbfucks,btohqsg
i dunno enough to comment but enough to say that many of them changed their views,btohqsg
Ok because I tookHistory CSE Econs  while taking CSE I canâ€™t help but notice that my History and Econs knowledge helped in understanding CSE. So from my POV CSE is reliant on knowledge of those subj. Im not sure if youâ€™ll be disadvantaged without the other subj. As for CSC  the syllabus is broadly the same but there are some slight differences but idk the specifics.,btohqsg
eh is not about typing but about annotating pdf,btohqsg
My exp says otherwise  50% of the reason I chose CSE is because of tha expectation but youâ€™ll be surprised how the research scared a significant number of them away.,btohqsg
eh u say cse i say csc,btohqsg
U applied to SP for PFP,btohqsg
so long no need code or do cad,btohqsg
unless you own the surface book,btohqsg
but i always bring my ipad to class,btohqsg
I chose CSE because I thought a lot PRC take CSC  but then it turns out my batch not enough to open CSC class  I know a few PRC friends in sch. I asked them why no take CSC  most say dw do research.,btohqsg
ok lah u have one school as sample size,btohqsg
eh i need cycle through snow and rain,btohqsg
if someone go kacao my notability library i literally will smack him,btohqsg
the paper will always be white bobian tho,btohqsg
ive friends who use microsoft one note,btohqsg
Iâ€™m not gonna sugar coat it  research by its very nature is hell  research on China is another level of hell  because sometimes China sources they require China phone number etc. etc. But your understanding of the world  not just China  changes after that. Itâ€™s fun to be able to understand things beyond what the media feeds you but thatâ€™s the reward of going through hell ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
i js rmb smth i heard abt and ive been thinking abt it for the past 5 mins its so stupid,btohqsg
are some parents too protective or smth lol,btohqsg
This is a very general question,btohqsg
Which makes it very easy to say yes to,btohqsg
but protective to the point that they would send anyone who confesses feelings for their child for disciplinary action?,btohqsg
i feel like the child is js stupid,btohqsg
but idk it may be the parents desired course of action,btohqsg
Sounds like you want to confess to someone but are finding reasons not to,btohqsg
no one likes me i dont even need to try,btohqsg
i dont rly want rs now anyway,btohqsg
As in Boy confess to Girlâ€™s parents they like the Girl  the Girlâ€™s parents send boy for discipline action?,btohqsg
so may not be parents idk,btohqsg
Why would the guy confess to girlâ€™s parents??,btohqsg
the guy confessed to the girl,btohqsg
then she reported him bc he confessed,btohqsg
that girl dk how to appreciate sia,btohqsg
you know that happened when shes 13 right,btohqsg
china legit dont let bgr before uni de,btohqsg
at 16 i havent been confessed to before but wtv,btohqsg
no theyre classmates so he's 13,btohqsg
maybe if got guy want to marry her she also report ohno,btohqsg
DM probably had a good laugh in the HOD room after that report,btohqsg
