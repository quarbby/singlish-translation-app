text,group
got dude called that in my squad also hahaha,btohqsg
Its always the indian fella with the darkest skin call ahneh,btohqsg
You should make it free of charge,btohqsg
I plan to at most introduce FAS,btohqsg
For every 5 paying students  1 student gets to attend classes for free,btohqsg
Just that it wasn’t called SGExams,btohqsg
But SGExams has broken off with that tuition centre,btohqsg
can i ask why the ns portal everyday maintenacne one,btohqsg
Bro thats ur biggest concern ?,btohqsg
eh nvr heard that tuition centre b4,btohqsg
Its been 1month plus my emart still havnt set up,btohqsg
How am i supposed to get my socks,btohqsg
SGExams and another place set it up,btohqsg
Cause the community raised concerns of some kind,btohqsg
It was a problem to begin with,btohqsg
Who is the community and what concerns they raised  I dunno,btohqsg
Its still a for profit in the end,btohqsg
The only thing that echoes what SGExams believes in is a volunteer for tuition scheme,btohqsg
Whereby there shldnt be charges at all,btohqsg
Is possible to achieve this  and idm doin it tbh. Prob gonna do it in uni alao,btohqsg
It would be cool to have a big volunteer tuition organisation,btohqsg
The for profit and no profit shld have a distinct line,btohqsg
Thats a qn no one has ever answered,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing the link :),btohqsg
I don’t know any big ones,btohqsg
Heartware Tuition ProgrammeFor children  whose parents are incarcerated or from low-income backgrounds  keeping up with their academics is an uphill battle. The motivation to learn wanes rapidly with the lack of positive role models in their lives. The Heartware Tuition Programme aims to place these children on equal footing with their peers through free weekly tuition  driven by youth volunteers from tertiary institutions.,btohqsg
Theres some that volunteer at teban areas for the poor and needy,btohqsg
Tuition industry needs a culling in sg,btohqsg
And they have mini group excursions,btohqsg
Tbh the only culling it needs,btohqsg
Tuition culture in SG is a bit too much,btohqsg
It’s nice to want to learn,btohqsg
It’s not nice to basically be forced to learn,btohqsg
Thats why no one shld be forced,btohqsg
It doesnt encourage self understanding/ research/ inquisitiveness,btohqsg
I went thru tuition and i loved math at a certain point in time from hating it,btohqsg
Tuition for many feels like a necessity,btohqsg
We need to cull the tutors,btohqsg
Like ‘I can’t do well in maths if I don’t get tuition’,btohqsg
I still feel is cost that is an issue,btohqsg
Its not... its just theres too many of them,btohqsg
I see schs like CJC chem department,btohqsg
Too little and it will become a monopoly,btohqsg
Giving only 2 qns for acid base equilibrium tutorial,btohqsg
Wtf  might as well not have tutorial,btohqsg
So your solution is not to fix those departments but to introduce essentially private schools that students can turn to,btohqsg
Its an avenue for additional learning resources,btohqsg
And if i were to fix those departmentsHow long will i take to get there,btohqsg
Why not run smth like khans academy then,btohqsg
Public schools should provide the full extent of any learning material most kids will need,btohqsg
But i feel my JC did provide adequate resources,btohqsg
That’s the problem  so fix it so that they do,btohqsg
Its not so easy to introduce change,btohqsg
If it was so easy it wont be a persistent issue,btohqsg
And even if one does it  no one will recognise ur efforts,btohqsg
Which is why some ppl run hagwons instead,btohqsg
Even if i were to introduce it,btohqsg
I will be a policy maker  not a teacher,btohqsg
That goes against what i want to do also,btohqsg
It kind of sucks that you can’t be both,btohqsg
Also there is parents mindsets cause many if not most parents are kiasu for their kid to do well or continue scoring As so send the kid to tuition,btohqsg
It’s the only thing stopping me from wanting to go to HQ,btohqsg
I straight up in front of parents say that if u are going for tuition for good grades and hope it does magic  u can stop aft this lesson,btohqsg
My parents never forced me to go to tuition,btohqsg
The parents are the main screwed up actors in the tuition issue,btohqsg
They just informed me one day in sec sch that i have tuition,btohqsg
I say that a student must rly have the interest and passion towards learning it,btohqsg
lowkey why ppl aim for elite schools so that they won’t feel the need to go for tuition cos the sch would provide the necessary resources,btohqsg
Yea they can always look for other tutors tho,btohqsg
but some can’t survive and go tuition as well,btohqsg
Mfw people go to elite schools and continue to go for tuition,btohqsg
My dad did that also esp for me but RI resources,btohqsg
Ri resources are trash in my honest opinion,btohqsg
Im more entertained in this convo,btohqsg
Honestly  streaming is a thing for a reason,btohqsg
i mean why do u think elite sch notes are so sought aftercos everyone is likeelite sch = btr notes,btohqsg
If your academic ability is at this level  you should be taught at this level,btohqsg
carousell is a v gd example,btohqsg
The best chem summary i found so far is made by 3 hci students,btohqsg
It even beats those tuition centre notes,btohqsg
Yea i didnt like the hoarde of elite sch resources given to me by my tutor dad it's not like i only have one subject to study,btohqsg
but ppl see it as a btr base of notes cos at the end of the day everyone wants to do as well as those in the elite schs what,btohqsg
Fr other schs use our notes and resources for lessons,btohqsg
Elite school notes are made for elite students,btohqsg
at the end of the day   we all js wna do well,btohqsg
Lol some ppl dont have eyes,btohqsg
Okay lah not too bad I only have one difficult student sec 5 and doesn't know what is 1-(1/2),btohqsg
I like students who rly ask a lot of qns,btohqsg
Rly makes me passionate in teaching,btohqsg
Yes but that doesn’t mean it makes sense to want to go to elite school just for notes and academic resources,btohqsg
cos im busy drawing in class,btohqsg
My teacher scolded me for asking too many ques during chem,btohqsg
But when u multiply a lot of qns by multiple students in a day.... LOL,btohqsg
The main advantage of elite schools is not notes and resources,btohqsg
well alot of ppl go cos of the resources tho,btohqsg
THEY R THE KING OF THE KING NOTES,btohqsg
Same thing as u but long ago,btohqsg
Chat with ya later at 2.40,btohqsg
i am sorry to all the tchrs who i slept in their class,btohqsg
What kind of elitism is this,btohqsg
"Some parents think ""lousy sch no future.elite school good future.""",btohqsg
i think my schl got cher,btohqsg
I generally don’t really mind if you are a student that does well,btohqsg
Cause that means you have a thing that’s working,btohqsg
My highest grade is a D,btohqsg
cos all my tchrs r like,btohqsg
“ memoriseee the entire set of notes”,btohqsg
If you sleep in class and you don’t do well  then we’re gonna have a lot of 1 to 1,btohqsg
lol if you’re not gna explain shit must as well nap and go home and uds myself,btohqsg
Can i have 1 to 1 with u,btohqsg
just saw telegram part timers ad on instastory wtf,btohqsg
I don’t think I’ve ever memorised anything much for O Levels,btohqsg
i had to memorise the whole chem tb in my desperation,btohqsg
It was for Our Student Dialogues,btohqsg
U guys had chem text books ?,btohqsg
Which are over now  so no more ads,btohqsg
Must be nice havign a chem cher and chem textbook,btohqsg
I realised school notes are just copied from textbook,btohqsg
So I just use the source,btohqsg
chem tchr copied and pasted the tb into notes,btohqsg
then bolded some words and told me to memorise it,btohqsg
i gave up went back to the tb and studied,btohqsg
i mean   memorised cOS I DIDNT UDS SHIT,btohqsg
I felt like some idiot when I was making notes for my teaching internship,btohqsg
Literally just copying and rephrasing textbook things,btohqsg
this is how most notes work lolll,btohqsg
All i remember from my sec sch chem was how i was punished regularly and how my teacher always used to talk about her trips instead of teaching,btohqsg
if not hw yall make notes HAHAHA,btohqsg
my tchr would talk abt how i suck at chem,btohqsg
don't you copy and rephrase in ur own words,btohqsg
They havnt seen mi notes yet thats why,btohqsg
Yeah I’m just confused about why schools make notes in the first place when textbook exists,btohqsg
i summarise the parts i have trouble with,btohqsg
which is something i cant undertsnad  why cant all JC use textbooks either...,btohqsg
Mi = most initiative in notes,btohqsg
then i draw out diagrams / visual reps to uds,btohqsg
it'll make everyt more standardiseD and leaves no space for disagreements and confusion lol,btohqsg
Just cause my notes say more u ask for standardisation,btohqsg
Teachers usually talk shit in the staff room,btohqsg
HAHAHA i wan ur notes sia sell me,btohqsg
Spf no night duty cannot make money,btohqsg
im selling my whole set of notes for 25 bro,btohqsg
u 5 per topic goes up to 100 dollars++,btohqsg
MI notes go at a premium,btohqsg
People dont understand what quality means,btohqsg
I accept everythign paynow paylah cash cheque bonds,btohqsg
+ my recruit pay less by 140 than the new batch of recruits,btohqsg
630 a month so you can buy the notes 5 times,btohqsg

@KopiGaDaibut in actual fact plant-san doesn’t rly get angry but its currently at the bottom of my priority list add more stickers tho,btohqsg
hi issit possible to enter poly library without membership?,btohqsg
Mona Lisa will be welcomed anywhere,btohqsg
I think SP need scan student ID,btohqsg
I'd think that they'd be more restrictive now,btohqsg
The lib would probably pay you to enter,btohqsg
iirc np doesn't require a student card. but i haven't been there in about 3 years so the rest can confirm lol,btohqsg
yep np no need student card to enter,btohqsg
what if i threw away the pin nus mailed me for application,btohqsg
I think you can still use Type 2 form,btohqsg
It's the subconscious of your past self telling you you are not fated with NUS,btohqsg

that time i lost mine too and i had to reapply next yr,btohqsg
You agree so why are you still bothering to apply?,btohqsg

@nus peeps  y'all locked out of luminus?,btohqsg

If you have nothing else  use that,btohqsg

if that is your best  give it  if not  use the better ones,btohqsg
welp time to get more smses and phone calls asking me to take up a loan,btohqsg
You need to declare your travel plan,btohqsg

Ppl who dk how code get owned lor,btohqsg
every1 copy code  then kenna mark down,btohqsg
Is just they dk how copy correctly lol,btohqsg
Dont even need copy with unds,btohqsg
Is they copy at the wrong time,btohqsg
its like when u copy fren essat,btohqsg
at least change up the format,btohqsg
The detection software is quite good,btohqsg
Most of the prof just dont care unless u push the envelope too much,btohqsg
Which is in this case la,btohqsg
"If you comment your code  you can tell the prof ""this code has the best complexity and practical run time"" then they got nothing to say already",btohqsg
That's assuming you know all the different algos at least,btohqsg
I got a feeling the copiers literally ctrl c ctrl v and poof submit,btohqsg
Aiyah who ask them copy during exam LOL,btohqsg
During normal mission/tutorial the copying is so rampant,btohqsg
Even better if you can quote public domain code like Py src code,btohqsg
"""How to find GCD""""pls find in py""""What no copy pasta""""Fk you this is euler algo.""",btohqsg
20 hours of labwork a week,btohqsg
Oi at where I am the humanities guys get better jobs,btohqsg
Stem guys too busy to train interview,btohqsg
Contact hours - - > spread of virus,btohqsg
It's not about ur degree unless it's professional degree ba,btohqsg
Just do any degree and gtfo,btohqsg
How do you clock 20 hours wtf,btohqsg
1010 is hard for many ppl,btohqsg
1010 is the lab heavy one,btohqsg
Any examples of why 1010s is hard,btohqsg
I assume they use standard algos,btohqsg
Cos ppl never do programming before lor,btohqsg
Yea den they only teach u syntax and all for like,btohqsg
But tbh if it  is really a prog exam even brute force will work,btohqsg
At where I am the history guys get better job than the cs guys,btohqsg
I still haven't seen a qn and what language they talking about,btohqsg
I think irl most of the history ppl,btohqsg
No la 48k is quite standard for deeptech,btohqsg
But people who end up in deeptech are few,btohqsg
Nobody wants to teach syntax because nobody wants to teach syntax,btohqsg
Make sure the client knows u from good uni and good degree,btohqsg
Whole point of consulting is for the CEO to listen to the 21 year old,btohqsg
But hedge funds are fucked up,btohqsg
After market close then go home le,btohqsg
"Can yall dun mix consultant profs and/or consultants with 10+ year experience with freshgrad ""consultants""",btohqsg
Same with mixing deep tech and runofthemill engineering,btohqsg
The newbie consultant no exp one,btohqsg
I have big doubt all hedge funds do public markets,btohqsg
Why I know cos me from mbb,btohqsg
Hedge funds play with stock and derivatives,btohqsg
I think public markets don't make that much money too,btohqsg
Eh wait to clarify what's public market,btohqsg
2mil + investor can do means privatr,btohqsg
Unless yougot 2mil you can lend me la,btohqsg
All need to be qualified investor,btohqsg
2mil equity as a private investor still private bank worthy dude,btohqsg
They try to get the most wealthy ppl,btohqsg
Btw I have no respect for hf,btohqsg
Bunch of assholes who shift money around and earn money even when their position lose money,btohqsg
I still wouldn't know if family offices would park their money in hedge so/shrug,btohqsg
They might. Might also use private equity or private banking in the BB,btohqsg
Go do passive investment that's it,btohqsg
HF never beat the market long term,btohqsg
Ok la most hf don't beat marke long term,btohqsg
Open an account put money then play,btohqsg
Eh atos quite well regarded sia,btohqsg
Mean u buy the stock for entire market,btohqsg
There entire market as a whole always appreciate in the long term,btohqsg
So just throw money at it and don't care le,btohqsg
Over 40 years climb 5x or 6x,btohqsg
If u reinvest dividend then overall return higher lor,btohqsg
If u young then reinvest ur dividend ma,btohqsg
When u older and have to rely on passive income then use the dividend lor,btohqsg
Why never go back SG last week,btohqsg
Siala go home on weekend ma,btohqsg
Now u go home u stuck at home 14 day,btohqsg
Tripos has never been cancelled even in ww2,btohqsg
TBH if you are working 8-5 it means you don't even need 8-hours to really finish work,btohqsg
ps me dunno all the cool stuff,btohqsg

ps i got influenced by my cute friend keep referring to i as me,btohqsg
1010 quite rigourous  my time was 2 written exams  2 practical exams + take home labs every week,btohqsg
Also why my tele lagging on my other acc sia,btohqsg
Can't even view all the previous messages sent,btohqsg
same exp. labs are 10-20 hour affair,btohqsg
of coz if ur lab grp got godly people,btohqsg
can leverage on their expertise also,btohqsg
I didn't find the labs hard,btohqsg
It was the PE and written exams that was scary,btohqsg
PE 2 suddenly pull out flood fill algorithm,btohqsg
Finals good luck finishing the paper,btohqsg
Doesn't help that you're forced to do the PEs in vim as well,btohqsg
vim quite nice to code in imo,btohqsg
just that now i dont code much le,btohqsg
Wah i cannot stand cli text editors  i need my mouse input,btohqsg
Finals time v tight eh  there's like 2 algorithm qns  1 struct qn and 1 recursion algorithm qn at the end of the paper,btohqsg
Each one need to write quite a bit of code,btohqsg
I don't understand the cs1010 thing either lol,btohqsg
All I know that it's a very difficult module,btohqsg
And that I'll need to prepare my anus for it,btohqsg
Ah it's Cs10 in decimal I see,btohqsg
*Jumps to science faculty instead*  only to find cs1010s,btohqsg
do u have cs kids spec-ing in sec?,btohqsg
Rather take it as a 2nd major instead,btohqsg
The module's around half infosec half cs,btohqsg
was thinking of spec-ing in sec,btohqsg
But honestly the security modules esp the practical part quite underwhelming,btohqsg
I really need to go and check on the available specialisations,btohqsg
You must specialise in 1 focus area,btohqsg
i was thinking of swe + sec  but idk what's the ideal path for it  cuz while i was planning  it seems that i'll need to take an extra mod outside of req,btohqsg
Ya and i need to learn what the flying fk is planck constant and schrodinger's equation,btohqsg
