to discuss the procedures and how to base the grades with the prelim grades,btohqsg
It's all before they get their results I tot?,btohqsg

It only said the results were similar to their prelims,btohqsg
for my school  they only moderated E and below,btohqsg
It didn't said it used their prelims,btohqsg
Answered in the link:For candidates who choose to sit for the re-examination  Cambridge Assessment and SEAB will count the better of the two grades  i.e. the better of the awarded grade and the re-examination grade  and this will be recorded as the final grade in their GCE O-Level result slip and certificate.,btohqsg
but i mean if basing off their prelims  it is gonna be moderated all grades,btohqsg
I didn't say used their prelims mah,btohqsg
I damn confused ngl I tot it was lost in Nov or smth,btohqsg
cnnt  frm what ik  ur o level results will be determined by ur prelim results and ur place in cohort  like they will take the avg or smtg like tst.,btohqsg
So their results they legit dk what,btohqsg
And I dun think they will be told their results,btohqsg

H2 chem was 2017 batchO lvl was 2018 batch,btohqsg
In fact I think the alevel one is unaffected in terms of results release,btohqsg
If I go on the MRT and see a stack of Olevel Papers the first thing I do is sell each one on carosell,btohqsg
Cuz O and A lvl taken almost same timing mahdiffer by a bit,btohqsg
Yeah and oni olevel release earlier in Jan than A,btohqsg
So they got time to process... also goes to show how much buffer time they got,btohqsg
