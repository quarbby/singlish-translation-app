Any news or hearsay of BTO ballot result?,btohqsg
Hi Lillian  the recent various BTO groups are set up by a group of passionate and helpful people (please try to understand if we reply late as we do have day jobs).We are not affiliated with any grassroots or HDB and it is purely a volunteer effort by people who help out with queries based on past experiences with BTO launches as well as past residents' queries to HDB.The residents' group is eventually handed over to a confirmed resident to manage as the other admins do seek to open new groups for upcoming launches.As for the verification process for residents' group  we would strongly advise to leave out unit number and application reference number as this is considered as personal identifiable information.Please also note that there is no compulsion to join these groups if you do not wish to do so.We also do not hold accountable the people who eventually manage the residents group as we believe that would be up to the individual project rules and regulations which should be set up and agreed by the residents themselves.Do kindly note that there are various scammers lurking around in the Telegram space which will seek to pm you anonymously. Do exercise extra caution and due diligence to be wary of unexpected messages/calls from such unknown persons.If unsure  you can try posting a screenshot of the message you encountered in the BTO groups so that other ppl can advise.Have a good weekend ahead thank you.,btohqsg
Please also note that BTOHQ is also not set up by any grassroots or HDB from my understanding as well.,btohqsg
For a list of groups that we have created  please refer tohttps://t.me/MrHousingBotThank you!,btohqsg
Confirm a Karen  !!! If you don't like than LEAVE,btohqsg
Just kick her out   you can't win a Karen logic,btohqsg
Hi Lillian  it's based on trust between you and the admins who are in the group. If you do not feel comfortable  there is no obligation for you to join the groups.However I would like to highlight that the point of the verification process is to ensure that the ones who are joining the residents' chat are residents.Telegram username handle can be changed at any point in time by the user so it is not unique.As for estate  block number and photo of OTP  you can blank out the unit number  application number etc  which ensures anonymity.There are no organizations or agencies that can provide such checks and balances as this is purely on a voluntary effort basis and also as Telegram is a public platform  which is used worldwide  it is not possible to implement such checks and balances.Disputes are part and parcel of human relationships and also likely part of living together in an estate. In my opinion  I would also advise to adopt a non-confrontational conflict resolution method to resolve disputes. After all  you'll be neighbours down the road.Hope you have a good weekend!,btohqsg
Dun need reply to her   God know what this Karen thinking about? We don't owe her any reply,btohqsg
Haha I would disagree with your comment... We should try to be understanding of differing views and seek to find a middle ground.,btohqsg
People not nice (not targeting anyone)doesn't mean you not nice right? You can be the better person in such cases,btohqsg
Dun need a middle ground  we don't owe her 🤣,btohqsg
She came in and demand transparency,btohqsg
Relax haha just explain only... Spread kindness k? 😁,btohqsg
We always have this kind of ppl in bto chat.,btohqsg
Just curious which bto u are aiming for ?,btohqsg
She seem to enjoy this dispute,btohqsg
while she may sound like a “karen”  perhaps we’re too quick to judge? after all i never considered lilian's perspective before and now that xy has explained the nature of this chat group  i guess it’s good to know this kinda stuff too? not taking sides by the way,btohqsg
She in many chat groups 🤣,btohqsg

Make sure you are really human before you talk to her,btohqsg
then groupbuy groupchats also need licenses from people who help buy from Shopee,btohqsg
Must be transparent than can join,btohqsg
I believe Lilian can suggest a better way to verify whether users are truly future residents of a particular BTO project before adding them to a resident’s group chat.If it’s possible without the checking of proof of selection  the admins will be more than happy to do so too  no need to be burdened with these infos provided.,btohqsg
the Proof of Selection is to verify that you're the resident of that project  and we always remind people to censor all personal information except the First Name and the Postal Code which is to ensure PDPAi feel if Lilian is particular against this  then maybe she can volunteer to manage these BTO project chatgroups and suggest a better way to verify each and everyone who join the BTO groupchat,btohqsg
Disputes  infos provided.The onus is on us to maintain our anonymity in these tele chats  any information you provide to others is out of your own will  disputes caused by shit talking are also our own responsibility.Perhaps only those who shit talk in tele groups are scared of their ‘personal info’ being used against them 😂,btohqsg
Exam question for regulation test for bto chatHow to manage a group when there are Karen in your group?A) mute themB) BAN themC) talk to themD) refer to specialist,btohqsg
but where the disputes at though  i don't see any in the groups i am in so far unless she's the one who started them,btohqsg
Why is one word capitalised? Must choose that one huh. LOL,btohqsg
maybe should choose D  refer to specialist,btohqsg
specialist must be licensed and regulated by HDB,btohqsg
Anyway bto chat mean to chat fun and exciting  unless u have your own  special view whether others will isolate you a not is your choice ultimately.Just don't make noise when people keep isolating you  this is very normal.Just need to open your heart take all the information  light heartedly.,btohqsg
To be honest bto group moderator quite poor thing.Most of them are doing it for free.Yet when they nv answer or help them ppl feel the moderator  die die need to help them spoon feed them.,btohqsg
