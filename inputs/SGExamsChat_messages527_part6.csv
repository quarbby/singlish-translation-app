The best place to see my abang-abang bomba!,btohqsg
yea it was for another person but then he deleted,btohqsg
Just a ambulance picture to brighten up your day,btohqsg
just saw this exact pic in lecture today,btohqsg
yea  cos risk allowance  shift allowance,btohqsg
Do I get the chance to shoot criminals,btohqsg
Why is sg so fkin hot man,btohqsg

Ryan's deep thoughts:If you ask a friend to follow you to well known part of a country that is well known for violence  he/she get killed.Is that premeditated murder,btohqsg
I mean the plastic bag is useful,btohqsg
Save it for like packing things,btohqsg
normal is the vector perpendicular to the plane,btohqsg
next thing you see is this,btohqsg
Got some goofy ah right hand rule shit,btohqsg
do you mean the cross product or smth,btohqsg
the physics right hand rule literally comes from cross product,btohqsg
finding the direction of normal vector of 2 vectors,btohqsg
i still have to deal with normals,btohqsg
if you dk shit abt it,btohqsg
get ready to be screwed big time,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I find vectors less painful than,btohqsg
holy fucking shit you actually know them,btohqsg
I've never dealt with them but i will soon,btohqsg
baking 3D poly into a 2D plane to make a normal map then use that as a tiled texture,btohqsg
I mean there are plenty of tools to generate them,btohqsg
i made a PBR using a pic but it fking sucked,btohqsg
if i shld use a noise 'input' into the normal map's colour  just vary the colours a bit from the blue for facing same direction as normal of actual plane/face  to other colours which states that that particular portion faces the other way,btohqsg
could make artificial bumps on a 2D plane,btohqsg
definitely is what should be on my mind,btohqsg
Not sure what kind of map you're making,btohqsg
it ain't science  as long asVunderstands it's fine :D,btohqsg
But as far as I know  most of the time  you don't work with normals directly,btohqsg
You generate it from something else,btohqsg
oh yea they're also called bump maps,btohqsg
but the shader im trying to use to export the texture to a game doesn't support,btohqsg
I keep thinking ure john smith,btohqsg
There are tools to do that,btohqsg
