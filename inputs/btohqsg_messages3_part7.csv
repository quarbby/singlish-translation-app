Your cpf is supposed to get an interest.if you use it to pay for the house  its not inside your cpf earning interest.if you sell your house  you have to put in the amount of cpf that you've used  PLUS the interest that it should have earned throughout the years.,btohqsg
almost there. the cpf grows in your account. if you pay 10%  it means taking the money from the cpf account  which means no growing.,btohqsg
It is better to leave ur cpf money in cpf than to pay off as much as you can to hdb because cpf interest is up to 5% while hdb is 2.6%,btohqsg
So only pay hdb when hdb ask you to pay,btohqsg
AI is still your money afterall. The only thing is  you will get lesser cash when you sell your house. Because you need to put the AI to your cpf,btohqsg
"Yeah  i think painting it as ""giving back to the government"" is a little skewed.",btohqsg
Technically you're paying to future you.,btohqsg
Basically cpf is for retirement. So plan your wisely.,btohqsg
Best if you have cold hard cash to pay instead of using your OA,btohqsg
But that's if you can't earn more than 2.5% of interest elsewhere,btohqsg
OA =2.5% VS banks@below 2% (except maybank with constant rate at 3%),btohqsg
But since you're not thinking to sell your BTO  then don't worry about the AI,btohqsg
"Hey guys! Just wanna ask.. Am I able to change one of the applicant from ""occupier"" to ""co-applicant"" without cancelling our BTO application üò¢",btohqsg
Yes you can email hdb with your application number..,btohqsg
accrued interest is the amount u need to pay back into your OA account when u sell away your unit. If HDB loan  IIRC 2.6%.So if you withdraw $100k from OA  next year if you sell (just e.g. min 3-5 yrs occupancy) U need to return $102 600 to your OA account. Than don't forget your monthly contribution to pay your HDB loan for that year  e.g. $1000 per month. So capital from OA $112 000 and multiply 2.6% per year.After compounding  the amount is going to be scary if you take 20-30 years loan. As long you don't sell and upgrade  it will be fine.,btohqsg
any of you waiting to collect keys of any of the above projects?,btohqsg

The percentage behind all these progress is based on a formula algorithm. It's not accurate if you compare with the existing construction progress of the yet finished projects,btohqsg
