yea maybe..but then again that was just 1 teacher...the rest were pretty ok in terms of teaching students,btohqsg
ur english level is better than mine,btohqsg
there use to be a saying from students in my school..manjusri is where you go to get your bi gu to kai hua..cause the logo looks like that,btohqsg
walk in then how to park car?,btohqsg
ok lah so use the hdb carpark,btohqsg
my school once had a assembly and blasted the license plates and cars of some of the present student's parents for blocking lanes/improper picking up of their kids,btohqsg
yea..forget about the fact the obnoxious color choice...as well,btohqsg
is it just the plate only or plate+ car,btohqsg
wah then the students would focus on the car more what,btohqsg
the blue was added only in the last 6yrs,btohqsg
whose parents got better car hahahaha,btohqsg
i rmb vividly there was a,btohqsg
the color stood out like a sore thumb,btohqsg
the car look like just washed/ new,btohqsg
i was the media person in charge of that very assembly..then next thing you know after blasing parents and their cars...the teacher in charge walked up to my room and told me to play a video saved on a thumbdrive,btohqsg
Y u all have alot of time to talk?,btohqsg
i load up the vid..and i instantly know what kind of vid it is,btohqsg
some ppl chat irl  some ppl sleep in  some ppl chat online,btohqsg
"the vid ""people getting hit by vehicles while looking at the phone""",btohqsg
no censor...nothing...saw the end of ppl lives that day i was sureschoolboy crossing divided highway in european city looking at phone  here comes thomas the tank engine(tram) ..and gone,btohqsg
if they wanted to bring across a message..im sure they did,btohqsg
sgexams telegram> SGExams discord> SGExams reddit,btohqsg
i think the scariest thing was that the vid appeared to be 10++ yrs old..and the scenes shown appeared to be from the dawn of the 2000s.The fact the phone already became a distraction even before smart phones came out was what stuck out to me,btohqsg
i went from sgexams reddit> sgexams telegram,btohqsg
never heard of that school in my life,btohqsg
sometimes i realise that poly and ite students are extremely smart too... sigh the elitism is just crazy in sg,btohqsg
i can tell from speaking to the people here,btohqsg
ya ik olvl 6-4 students who go poly,btohqsg
I have a classmate who dropped out in,btohqsg
UK theres a low-key a meme where it's like,btohqsg
Can't be we both know one right...,btohqsg
Ik like 5 ppl who went the,btohqsg
1 mass comm then 1 is law then 1 is common business another common sci,btohqsg
The fact none went to infocomns says alot,btohqsg
This 1 extracted orange would know,btohqsg
i would suppose because Tp and TMJC are both in the eastern side of singapore,btohqsg
Inb4 seen U irl but nvr realised/j,btohqsg
what voting sia its just one choice: putin or putineitherways putin will win,btohqsg
https://www.politico.eu/article/high-noon-vladimir-putin-opposition-trolls-russia-rigged-election-alexei-navalny/Not sure if you‚Äôve seen this,btohqsg
picture of an elephant looking at Â§ß‰æø,btohqsg
It was reported on news sites had the one of the only anti war candidates (Boris Nadezhdin) been qualified he would‚Äôve gotten around up to 30%  but anyway he was disqualified by the electoral commission on questionable grounds. But I really wonder how much Alexei Navalny would‚Äôve gotten had he not been arrested  and was allowed to run in a free and fair election.,btohqsg
some ppl just can't be helped,btohqsg
Birds of the same feather flock together I guess,btohqsg
It's 2335 im not thinking straight,btohqsg
Wow why did i get pinged at the very moment im looking at the chat,btohqsg
if you attempt suicide over long division... Long division isnt the problem. Please seek professional help. I'm not even joking at this point,btohqsg
Yasia. She should probably check in at a psychiatric hospital if she wasn‚Äôt exaggerating,btohqsg
I have ss of florals shittalking neko luna  wonder if i should dm neko luna lol,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs quite disheartening now she suddenly like just turn her back on those who were just trying to help,btohqsg
it's in dm i dont think it's very good tbh,btohqsg
I probably should never join sge discord,btohqsg
but she has said stuff about neko luna here befpre,btohqsg
i nvr ban cuz its not that severe lol,btohqsg
uty ba  but if she leaks rands stuff then i think you/admin should at least mute?,btohqsg
But like right even before YT ‚Äúowadio‚Äù as an admin,btohqsg
I rmbr he was the owner last time,btohqsg
How come he step down as owner even before the incident,btohqsg
he trf owner to my boss who trf to me üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
He wadio cuz i kicked him out for airing laundry lol üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
if they do u need to screenshot n send me,btohqsg
Ya i read i tot it was guo fen,btohqsg
read from here ba then you will see how close florals and luna are,btohqsg
I‚Äôm quite sure florals means it,btohqsg
Then i also punish josh also w same punishment i gave yt,btohqsg
But like if your info is alr public what difference does it make,btohqsg
So no point of her doing that,btohqsg
i mean ppl with the right connections can prob find out who i am based on the mirror selfies alone,btohqsg
and i got doxxed before so i know how to handle if someone want to play,btohqsg
But he was never admin I thought,btohqsg
omg first time someone shit talk me on discord,btohqsg
No i muted both of them for 7d,btohqsg
i mean at some point i stopped caring,btohqsg
but i alr stopped posting the pics,btohqsg
Exactly didn‚Äôt you say you got identified by some in dhs,btohqsg
I heard a few days ago got cosplayer trying to put pics here,btohqsg
only 1 person and not from this chat,btohqsg
But is that person in dhs also,btohqsg
but tbh my dp also shows my pic what,btohqsg
But how did that person find out if he/she not here,btohqsg
cause the person is in another chat with me  is a small chat,btohqsg
and my old dp alr shows my identifying features  so yeah,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt mind being an admin on tele so I can ban bots,btohqsg
i still find this funny bc,btohqsg
you can't take discord and come here to vent,btohqsg
oh  i think theres another one,btohqsg
then can't take tele and go discord vent,btohqsg
Then how come I can see YT messages ah,btohqsg
Guys ltr she post on the reddit about how the platforms are toxic,btohqsg
i'm just saying man at some point you'd think they start wondering if they're the problem,btohqsg
No offence but if it smells bad wherever you go maybe is time to check your shoes,btohqsg
Hahhaaahahhaa as if i nvr see those posts before,btohqsg
If like that I would be committing suicide after coding class already,btohqsg
Oh so is it like he got muted  unmuted  then now muted again,btohqsg
I forgot why i muted him,btohqsg
Cos I thought the Josh incident was a while ago,btohqsg
But he sent messages quite recently,btohqsg
No i muted him on disc,btohqsg
its either1. shes lying about being suicidal which is just problematic2.she is genuinely suicidal which means she needs to seek professional help instead of talking to siaolangs online,btohqsg
N then later one of the other fellas decided to ban him üòÇ,btohqsg
I think it's cause of me,btohqsg
Why r yall taking sides this is so funny for 0 reason,btohqsg
i know there is a another convo but keep in mind  this is one weapon the US has that Russia does not. Its a missle that contains no explosives but instead acts like a blending machine..where the moment it strikes  blades of steel will potrude and cut anything in its way to pieces..including human flesh and bones,btohqsg
i think this entire chat knows you are banned from the discord,btohqsg
But no one who is having mental health issues will be openly announcing it bruh  it is so fake,btohqsg
thats why i acknowledged there's another convo,btohqsg
i mean it's not about taking sides,btohqsg
I think it depends but I don't want to pass judgement on other people,btohqsg
Yall hating on each other is so funny,btohqsg
the demographic between the two platforms is just very different,btohqsg
Like the stats also showing a significant portion not opening to people / seeking professional help,btohqsg
How does this affect lebron legacy,btohqsg
Everyone treat it damn diff la,btohqsg
i tried talking to the discord and couldn't last 48 hours,btohqsg
half their chat time was spamming copypasta lol,btohqsg
I was gonna leave and stayed because of you then you left üò°üò°,btohqsg
i just dun like using tele cuz its a constant keep on going thing n u cant rly backread,btohqsg
ok but when i say demographic i mean like,btohqsg
the perspective people have on things is v diff,btohqsg
I dun even hv a discord account  not planning to have one,btohqsg
Tele is like whatsapp chat but with blue theme,btohqsg
My brother is addicted to it,btohqsg
i have several accs..all pretty much used for twitch,btohqsg
i just like things being stored on a cloud,btohqsg
I created tele coz in uni everything is on tele lol‚Ä¶no more old fashion WhatsApp,btohqsg
i only use tele for my tele channel n for when ppl text me on tele,btohqsg
but i dont rly use tele cuz my mom uses my tele acc too,btohqsg
tele is nice so people don't need to know my number,btohqsg
Why is my prof posting something at 11.51pm,btohqsg
no leh i feel like tele more old ppl than young ppl,btohqsg
also this is exactly why people come on tele  get shit on then go discord to vent about how shit tele is,btohqsg
I‚Äôm actually lazy to go between tell and WhatsApp,btohqsg
i still use whatsapp for dominant comms,btohqsg
tele people are annoyed with how stupid discord people are,btohqsg
WhatsApp I just use it for sch stuff nowadays,btohqsg
My aunt created tele in hope that I will reply her faster lol,btohqsg
Now uni official or not is all tele,btohqsg
Theres a lot of old ppl on disc tho?,btohqsg
only person i text on whatsapp is my professor,btohqsg
Damn. But I hope it will never be used. Our generation hasn‚Äôt experienced a war in very long time and some have said we have grown soft as a result. And as time passes it feels like world leaders are forgetting about the lessons that we should have learnt from ww2.,btohqsg
Idk most of my older friends come from disc,btohqsg
There was a point in time where I keep on being added to spam groups so I went to off privacy‚Ä¶,btohqsg
There was this idiot who spam call + WhatsApp me,btohqsg
Everything hard and fast proof there,btohqsg
ive been in both worlds..spent quite a few hundred hrs on each alr..overtime  you will just become someone that doesn't follow anybody's rules..irregardless of the platform,btohqsg
Anyway i'm wondering what will happen if neko luna finds out the stuff that floral said about her,btohqsg
Eventually if they find out she talks out of both sides of her mouth  she‚Äôs gonna be very isolated,btohqsg
She already know I am not stupid but keep calling and spamming messages for more than a month before she recently gave up getting me,btohqsg
this is absolutely unrelated to anything i'm saying,btohqsg
I still dk who is florals,btohqsg
J1 from yijc alw calling herself dumb,btohqsg
I just one day see she randomly appear out of nowhere i just assume she new kia,btohqsg
Ngl i feel bad for her... I feel like she has issues she need to work on... But sge is not a therapy group and is a horrible place for ppl to seek mental health support,btohqsg
Alot of trauma dumping I dare say on here,btohqsg
Sounds like someone out of touch w adult life tbh,btohqsg
What is ryan saying  i have no idea,btohqsg
that's how i would describe the sge discord lol,btohqsg
I tot she was once here  she not here anymore ah,btohqsg
Oh ya i rmb why i muted bedok now,btohqsg
you literally said ppl go to tele get shit on and go to discord to vent about how shit tele is....ive been on both sides and shit on both sides.,btohqsg
I think ctk is just a bit goofy ahh but he isnt an inherently bad person,btohqsg
Oh ya i wonder why she suddenly disappeared,btohqsg
your conclusion was out of nowhere,btohqsg
you dont dictate how i live my life..i dont dictate how you run yours..so respect that basic idea,btohqsg
No definitely not my parents are poor source for mental health support,btohqsg
I feel they just can‚Äôt relate to what we are facing,btohqsg
But legit tho why would u come to strangers seeking mental health support,btohqsg
man florals said we were flaming her but from a tutor perspective it's incredibly frustrating to have to baby someone's emotional problems while teaching long division lol,btohqsg
No because even in therapy/counselling you have to be willing to help yourself if you keep self depreciating and dw to work with the therapist they also cannot help youYOU have to be the one who want to change the therapist can only help you to change yourself. The therapist not a witch doctor that magically fixed all ur problem,btohqsg
Me telling them the other way round,btohqsg
Can someone send the long division thing again,btohqsg
look for r's ss sent here,btohqsg
But he wouldn‚Äôt have seen the pics you sent here I thought,btohqsg
I literally told my mum ‚Äòu come pharmacy  see whether u can get that 1st class hon easily‚Äô,btohqsg
the person saw my dp mah then my old dp is me in sch uni,btohqsg
Yea they can‚Äôt create magic on you,btohqsg
wait js the person. even here,btohqsg
Oh is it the one u said she is saying too much about herself here,btohqsg
I forgot the content of what she said over here,btohqsg
theres no fun flaming someone when theyre not in the chat,btohqsg
therapy can't do shit if U don't want to try to change,btohqsg
otherwise is tank and go gym,btohqsg
clever...and you want a throphy for that or you want me to shut my mouth? I dont beat around the bush,btohqsg
she was panicking coz she think she dumb,btohqsg
otherwise my mental will get fucked,btohqsg
She flaming some of us here in discord for no good reason,btohqsg
i think im dumb and im panicking too,btohqsg
im jobless for fucks sake i cant even find one,btohqsg
How did floral become a topic here now,btohqsg
But wtv la  not like we can force her to seek mental help,btohqsg
I noticed she got onto disc in mid feb,btohqsg
late jan and she lasted like a month,btohqsg
The onus is upon her or her loved ones to bring her to imh,btohqsg
She wldnt survive the real eorld bruh,btohqsg
then it must have seen like ive seen it all,btohqsg
There are ppl who are legit suffering  there are also elope who are self-victimizing,btohqsg
Wait but what did she flame discord abt,btohqsg
Is she faking her suicide or what,btohqsg
she was on discord q a while ago -> came to tele -> back on discord on new account,btohqsg
yes part time i just ended a shift,btohqsg
I was surprise when i saw rand trying to do long division,btohqsg
i meant a actual not bad job,btohqsg
i jus thought she was jokingly say she dumb,btohqsg
the discord is the easiest place to shit on the tele bc people will just dogpile,btohqsg
but she actually think she is dumb,btohqsg
Not like tele is any better üíÄ,btohqsg
like you dn to care what it's about,btohqsg
Wait I suddenly remembered about her saying she needs pills to sleep due to anxiety??,btohqsg
this is mean but i meant it,btohqsg
ok im gonna go sleep now yall have fun byebye,btohqsg
I think she legit has mental illness but don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the scope,btohqsg
Like I can‚Äôt tell whether everything she said is real,btohqsg
Yea regardless  hope she get the help she need,btohqsg
i believe it when she say she does but a gc of 2k strangers isn't gonna coddle her,btohqsg
Idk how she gonna survive JC in this state tbh,btohqsg
like i'm sorry that's not how things work,btohqsg
huh the long division girl flame rand??????,btohqsg
thats not even a fair fight,btohqsg
i never said it was  i have plenty of real life interactions and i suppose you as well. its all fair game  just live your life the way you want  if you dont like me so be it. i dont hold grudges  i admit my mistake but i dont let it take a hold of me. Its to the best of me mentally and to everybody else here,btohqsg
I remembered my math Cher telling the class this 2 years probably gonna be the most intense 2y in your life,btohqsg
Is it the lxrth person florals,btohqsg
my friends there mostly did p well,btohqsg
Is this her first time interacting online with people???,btohqsg
i think she blocked me on tele lmao,btohqsg
Yea bruh feel I needed a lot of mental game in Jc prep‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Probably your friends just among the top few there,btohqsg
Holy shit she join first msg 15th feb now 15th march she got 9k msgs in disc,btohqsg
I think even when i started becoming active on disc i was max 6k msgs a week,btohqsg
But actually one of my coursemate disappeared from y1-3 and there were speculations she depression‚Ä¶then y4 suddenly reappeared,btohqsg
Idk how she survived from y1-3,btohqsg
i've used discord for 10 years and i've never been that active,btohqsg
even during my escaping online phase,btohqsg
Yes definitely‚Ä¶if I did not go through Jc  I think I would change course by now,btohqsg
then retake while he was in a infantry unit,btohqsg
when someone has a stuck mindset...they have a stuck mindset. no amt of help will be able to get them out of it. for people like these  i just leave them be. Society will take care of these people,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt kuro say sth like yi not even half the ppl qualify forLocal Uni,btohqsg
need mental prep meh just mug and dont stop lor,btohqsg
i stupid also i j work hard and i did fine (less fine than u but yes),btohqsg
To mug nonstop  u need some mental capacity,btohqsg
"i have 0 clue how ""smart"" i am",btohqsg
Wait in yi the top 10% R the ppl that qualify for big 3 in yi ah,btohqsg
not for jc but for uni,btohqsg
And to mug around people who don‚Äôt even study  another level of mental capacity needed,btohqsg
Also the good teachers probably can‚Äôt be bothered to stay for long,btohqsg
I heard from my friend is 80 and above,btohqsg
no u just need to tank and pray u dont go insane,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just gonna continue to perpetuate this cycle bad students and bad teachers unless the principal does like some massive overhaul (not happening as long as de silva is there),btohqsg
My friend from Yi told me most of the people there were forced to go Jc (by parents),btohqsg
Wait i think florals left the disc lmaoo,btohqsg
They forced to go JC by parents,btohqsg
There are too classes? I tot it is by subject combo,btohqsg
They need a Mr Kwek like nyjc,btohqsg
Prolly top class amongst popz subj combi,btohqsg
Or Mr Low also. He helped decrease the ny cut off even further and carried on Mr kwek‚Äôs legacy,btohqsg
She like quits and rejoins and quits,btohqsg
from what i hear  i don think yi can be as bad as rp in terms of positional importance as a jc?..or so i hope,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt understand her thought process,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok we still love you kuro,btohqsg
it took me way too long to be shit talked on discord,btohqsg
Come find me from 24th June,btohqsg
I still wonder if josh is coming back on April fools,btohqsg
Time to plan my next joke,btohqsg
Good that she realized Reddit is not where to go for mental health issues,btohqsg
How do you know the Reddit account  I tot Reddit gives anonymous,btohqsg
OMG I see that a lot of times,btohqsg
I remembered seeing something about academic comeback in YIJc,btohqsg
if she put her flair her subject combi,btohqsg
why is she so upset abt combi on discord,btohqsg
Idk I got a very anonymous name that can‚Äôt be changed,btohqsg
Bruh no way he gonna scroll through idk how many messages was that,btohqsg
i keep this seeing fella everywhere bruh,btohqsg
Yes I see that paradoxiful many many times,btohqsg
i noticed cuz the flair says bmeh,btohqsg
and i rmb reading her post abt how she cldnt take bcmh,btohqsg
why does florals have rand's phone number,btohqsg
one of us  one of us,btohqsg
n im so confused are randkmdkd and juicecogens two different ppl,btohqsg
juicecogens is r and usually the one we refer to as rand,btohqsg
ok the edit made my line sound weird,btohqsg
isnt this just self pwn then...,btohqsg
I jus find her sad tbh,btohqsg
I think she mention before how her mom shit on her everyday jus because she not from ri/hcl,btohqsg
not illegal but probs enough to be dealt with online,btohqsg
Coz her mom straight As in china‚Äôs top uni,btohqsg
So she expect her child to be the same,btohqsg
did she trauma dump abt this,btohqsg
She trauma dump to the pt I'm like,btohqsg
And I thought my tolerance is,btohqsg
that was a large chunk of it,btohqsg
man i tot i was king of trauma dumping,btohqsg
I'm q open abt shit ive seen,btohqsg
What u gonna do stand outside my office and throw rocks?,btohqsg
Q alot of ppl know me outside alr,btohqsg
i tot someone said one is nsf one is owadio,btohqsg
But I used to do alot of public facing stuff,btohqsg
Doxx my phone number than doxx lor,btohqsg
i also don't really care if people doxx me,btohqsg
I got random people call me for one month straight,btohqsg
i'm not hard to find if you bother,btohqsg
Then got the stupid poppy person,btohqsg
why got ppl so boliao one lol,btohqsg
even if someone give me a number to call i wont bother cuz i dun pick up calls let alone make calls,btohqsg
Real the only ppl I actually bother calling R my family üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
I cant find this in the chat but gist of it is just-mom from top uni in china  straight As-disappointed at floral for not going RI and bring shame to the family-cousins all around the world in other top unis-mom insist her to go JC  think poly/ite is for hooligans,btohqsg
i mean ig difference in expectations,btohqsg
why wld u put ur number on linkedin,btohqsg
lol someone here literally posted their number bc he didn't care,btohqsg
maybe i shld make a real linkedin account,btohqsg
I have one but haven't rly,btohqsg
i have one but its a fake linkedin,btohqsg
then some random ppl from these schs try to connect w me,btohqsg
i'm easy to find bc there's only so many people doing what i'm doing rn,btohqsg
and my face is on my profs website,btohqsg
Same energy as Ur bunny@aki923182but less fluffy,btohqsg
make it and sell to her,btohqsg
also why is chanric the literal first recommendation i get after searching it up,btohqsg
not the first person to be surprised,btohqsg
he's my junior in ntu lol,btohqsg
i've told stories of him here,btohqsg
uh y1 ntu physics ori he asked prof whether he could take y4 mods as a y1,btohqsg
chanric looks more like a discord mod than i do bruv,btohqsg
i know someone from my internship liddat also,btohqsg
i wish i was that smart,btohqsg
oh yea chanric came back here for a brief period,btohqsg
like right after o levels results released,btohqsg
i know an ntu biosci version of chanric,btohqsg
yea he came here and was like,btohqsg
^ he basically kept promoting his friend or smth,btohqsg
wait i've heard of this randy,btohqsg
apparently this actually good at physics dude,btohqsg
but he relief teacher at ny or smth,btohqsg
oh ya he applied for teaching at ny during the sem,btohqsg
idk how he cope with 5 days of teaching with his own mods during the sem itself but,btohqsg
apparently he's smart enough to do so,btohqsg
no no we just telling story,btohqsg
bruh i doing nth tutoring 1 kid rn i alr struggling to juggle tutoring the fella and doing nothing,btohqsg
as in we talking about someone that was here during jc open house period,btohqsg
Basically last time what happened lasa,btohqsg
maybe just my amazing procrastination skills,btohqsg
just goes to show how impressive this randy dude is fr,btohqsg
but ngl i'd wanna teach or smth if i could,btohqsg
maintaining his fch while teaching 5 days a week,btohqsg
Isit until Ur PhD over then can teach,btohqsg
scholarship agreement is to not take any other employment during this period,btohqsg
like full time focus on my work,btohqsg
i mean if i take stuff that's not traceable ig?,btohqsg
how much does ntu pay u,btohqsg
or do u not get paid,btohqsg
chan ric (an sge and irl legend) came here and kept promoting his friend in ntu that's also a relief teacher for NYJC  and asking people to go meet him at the canteen during ny open house,btohqsg
he's a legend for a lot,btohqsg
wait are you allowed to sign up for the peer teaching then,btohqsg
Is he the guy from tikok,btohqsg
initially it was take home 2.8k then after i passed my qualifying exam (1.5 years into my phd) it goes up to 3.5k. then now moe increase all these things so it's 4k,btohqsg
i remember he made a very good video about how to learn  but i saved it and never looked at it again lmao,btohqsg
For some reason I can't help but at first think abt like the Chris Chan shit,btohqsg
the phd students i currently work w rn are all being paid arnd 4k+,btohqsg
uhh unpaid they don't care  but paid stuff if it's within NTU usually just write in they ok,btohqsg
yea that's about the standard rn,btohqsg
the paid peer teaching like pretty easy to bypass,btohqsg
oh yea how was complex midterm,btohqsg
like if the undergraduate is friends with someone  they can just fill in their name for their teaching slots and get the money lmao,btohqsg
3 questions  i didnt know how to do all 3,btohqsg
but its because im pretty dumb,btohqsg
nope  written on the paper itself,btohqsg
tbh that was my year experience also,btohqsg
nah this CSA is literally so bad,btohqsg
he interrupted the exam 6 times to correct his errors on the paper,btohqsg
lowest in the cohort was 1/30 in my year,btohqsg
and the last time he interrupted the paper he actually missed out an important info crucial to understand/answer the question for one of the question,btohqsg
oh it was out of 30 for your year,btohqsg
im just glad i got through this week,btohqsg
qm1 mid terms  ps2 mid terms  complex mid terms  lab report and viva all on the same week is no go,btohqsg
i mean he's been a legend even before i was in this gc,btohqsg
idk what he stirred in this gc,btohqsg
but the fact that ntu has a thread on him,btohqsg
then ntu orientation he kept asking if he could take final year mods as a y1,btohqsg
ik bc he‚Äôs my junior in ntu lol,btohqsg
and worked with some of my friends,btohqsg
oh yea then last time IAPS (international association of physics students) didn‚Äôt have an sg branch so he joined their AGM as an individual candidate and apparently was a meme there too,btohqsg
at least now we have a branch,btohqsg
i think it got recommended üòÇ,btohqsg
the other chan ric stuff need to ask the super super laojiao,btohqsg
oh yea he said this but iirc he didn‚Äôt do super well for his y1 mods,btohqsg
and during y1 lab he had some issues working with lab partners from poly lol,btohqsg
rn he has a second upper gpa,btohqsg
i hope i enter pass/fail course,btohqsg

is that why you didnt start on your hol hw?,btohqsg

https://screenrant.com/dead-demons-destruction-makoto-shinkai-praise-suzume/the man does not stop goddam,btohqsg
oh lmao i misread and thought he had another film coming out,btohqsg
definitely going to have one next year prob  he churns them out every 3 yrs lmao,btohqsg
it's so funny how i have access to all the econs stuff even though i dont take,btohqsg
cause they share to whole level,btohqsg
My friend said your sch econs dept is... üíÄ,btohqsg
there's a reason why my friends and i chose to take goofy humans subjs instead of econs,btohqsg
IP kids tell all the jaes,btohqsg
i think most of the jaes in my class are doing econs,btohqsg
myfriend say they dont give you the answers you need to write to get the marks but you need to extrapolate yourself,btohqsg
sum bug bite me ystd i think,btohqsg
idk cause i don't take but i saw my friend looking at hwachong and ejc notes,btohqsg
then she say those notes better than ours,btohqsg
eh can U send me the econs lecture notes,btohqsg
nah but i usually put my name  nric  and what the doc is to be consistent and easily identifiable,btohqsg
swear it was there just like 3 months ago,btohqsg
Real then you gonna find me at arcade all day alrd,btohqsg
i heard this about dhs even 10 years ago. partly why i chose geog,btohqsg
This is my j1 tutor‚Ä¶our answers to the tutorial qns became the answers,btohqsg
why would you take econs without a passion...is it just because of the easier workload,btohqsg
I think alot of ppls mentality is,btohqsg
got 1 person ik   she was deciding between geog or econs. She say she take econs cause its the jc humanities with the most widely available tuition,btohqsg
I nvr hear ppl have geog tuition,btohqsg
She say shes gonna need tuition for both so might as well take econs,btohqsg
but econs is like 50% theory 50% application,btohqsg
Geog also got q abit of applications tho,btohqsg
How is that relevant to my comment,btohqsg
the theory part can score one but the application is like gg,btohqsg
econs the diversity of answers are wild,btohqsg
It's rly abt the question dissection,btohqsg
I'm saying this for both geog n econs,btohqsg
like even with the ans sheet i still dk how to allocate marks,btohqsg
The qns techniques R more standard,btohqsg
Maybe it's cuz it's my h1,btohqsg
Idk how wack they can get at H2,btohqsg
ya h2 econs feels more worth,btohqsg
Cuz wthell is up w the MNC bullshit,btohqsg
Geog or econs essay I couldn't even tell when my friend show me what they doing bruh,btohqsg
Like right I feel the main diff for econs between H1 n H2 is the,btohqsg
For geog is more the content,btohqsg
Cuz both H1 and H2 got essay and drq,btohqsg
for h1 econs they just remove the essay and add 20 marks to the passage based thing  not worth,btohqsg
I mean the fact that TM basically print almost the exact same,btohqsg
Notes for both H1 and hw,btohqsg
And just slap some stuff as,btohqsg
Ya that's y ik the diff betw H1 and H2 decently well I think?,btohqsg
bro i find hist more bearable  maybe it's just passion,btohqsg
The depth of content for answering that one I not sure alrd,btohqsg
content wise i think less by 3 chapters,btohqsg
Market structure is low-key fucked but,btohqsg
but i think with the new 70rp system the number of econs takers will drop,btohqsg
cos now i see more ppl taking ell/geog/tsd,btohqsg
