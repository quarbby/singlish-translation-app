Must be able to read your own torque graph  and turbo chart,btohqsg
Start at about 70kph with the rev right before the boost kicks in / peak torque,btohqsg
no point for NA cars alr,btohqsg
And you‚Äôll get the correct 100-200 with no more than 0.1 secs difference,btohqsg
ur I4 turbo make same power as ur NA V8,btohqsg
Bmw usually under declares  porsche idk  dont have opportunity to drive one haha,btohqsg
For me too. A 1.2mil gt2rs speaks more volume than someone with say a  huracan. Of cos the sto is a different league,btohqsg
I see. Now 40t a bit hot  next time hahaha,btohqsg
ok gonna deregister my car alr-R,btohqsg
NA has its charm la  but nowadays the turbo lag not so bad anymore,btohqsg
i would really like a 45 merc tbh even though it‚Äôs a 4cyl,btohqsg
it just doesnt have the competitive edge anymore,btohqsg
turbo so much more efficient too  governments would wanna phase it out one day,btohqsg
Anything below 2k is reasonable. For the amount of power,btohqsg
i hope not i love my vtec,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need to go to 40t,btohqsg
or breakfast run into malaysia and kill two birds with one stone üôÇ,btohqsg
Im super amazed at the engineering. A factory 2L turbo with 420bhp,btohqsg
10-20 years ago  people use NA because turbo lag was bad. Thats why porsche came out with the 996 GT3 etc etc. Nowadays what is turbo lag? 911 turbo can easily smoke any of those V8 muscles already,btohqsg
ok la for me I prefer the sheer pleasure of driving. Fast cars doesn't necessarily mean fun carsüòè-R,btohqsg
back in 2015  their 2l turbos produced 360 stock,btohqsg
you think the 991 GT3RS will every be faster than a GT2RS? i doubt so,btohqsg
gt2rs gotta go 997 for me mann haha,btohqsg
the GT2RS will definitely be faster w high power rating. But the 4.0L NA will sing all the way to 9k rpm,btohqsg
Porsche NA engines especially the 4.0 tend to have this very high pitch scream after 8k rpm,btohqsg
All that boost it‚Äôs near the limit,btohqsg
abit contradictory since we‚Äôre on the topic of NA and turbo but i really love those old 80s hot hatches so light and nimble,btohqsg
sadly is true haha  with a tune that engine gna go very very quickly,btohqsg
forge the whole engine the car will still break,btohqsg
Yeah thats what im afraid off. I had a diesel car recently  sold it after a year. Didnt know what the govt will do. Road tax was already a kill joy  by 2025 idk if they would increase again.But then i bought a na LOL. I hope they dont raise the road tax cap to phase me out,btohqsg
but NGL  both NA and turbo cars got their own merits-R,btohqsg
but long run reliability aside  those 45s are mechanical beauties,btohqsg
Hahaha not my thing anymore. Just drive for fun,btohqsg
what was the diesel? share share,btohqsg
a few years back i had a family member looking at the 2.8 grand voyager üòê,btohqsg
i was just looking at the tech video on the new 992 GT3RS. U think it can last as long as previous generation porsches? I doubt the tech will even survive 10 years. But when you look at cars like the 964 930  this cars were made to last. Only time will tell how well the GT3RS was engineered to last,btohqsg
that drs might malfunction sooner then dsg gearboxes if u ask me,btohqsg
i just have a feeling those won‚Äôt last so long,btohqsg
interesting topic to ponder about now that you have mentioned itü§î-R,btohqsg
exactly. Its so techy. Electronic rebound control etc. If one gets into an accident  how much is it to replace a full set. How long will the suspension last before it requires changing?,btohqsg
good when they work and last,btohqsg
but such a pain when need to change,btohqsg
"Many things to consider when buying a new car. Personally everyday i find a new reason not to buy a new car  especially volvo.Adapted from Nikos Tan on VPCSI posted this in VPCS:-Volvos today will give a whole new meaning to ""all conti is like that"". Especially in certain regions where consumer laws are weak  you'll pretty much be at loss when issues get complicated. Even if they're straightforward  one will also have to set aside a sum for potential replacement of parts that are ""not suppose"" to fail so early (i.e. prop-shaft  coil  suspension).Problems aside  try finding a wiring diagram or schematics for a W213  C8 or G30. You'll easily find whatcha looking for pretty quickly. Now try for an S90. Despite being launched sometime back  you will still not be able to find a single one without paying a premium subscription. And even if one wants to pay  you need to be in US/Canada  or UK/Europe. Outside of these regions  you're pretty much out of luck. My V40's infotainment just failed 1 month back. $3.3k to replace and it can only be done at the dealer because outside workshops have no access to VIDA to program the new module.Volvos aren't what they were used to be anymore. When the VEA was introduced and they removed the dipstick (a simple fail proof oil level dipstick in favour of an electronic sensor)  it is proof that Volvo has gone way beyond the needs and requirements of the customer. It is focused fairly and squarely on removing many vehicle owners from checking their own cars basic signs and thereby driving owners into the hands of the dealer network when issues surface; essentially complicating and thereby effectively neutering many owners from a very simple yet essential check on the life blood of an engine. Wanna know how much exactly to fill? Those information are not easily accessible too.For future EVs  Volvo have also blocked access to check the SoH of the battery without special tools & permissions  again effectively driving owners to the dealer. It is 'fine' if the cars are reliable. But if it isn't  this is a real problem in financial and mental safety.If only things were more transparent and easily accessible like the past  owning a Volvo would have been such a joy. Oh wells  ""if only"". Can dream for now. haha. Want a complete peace of mind? Just lease a Volvo. Buying will be gamble.",btohqsg
Hardly actually. A remap i think brings it close to 550bhp,btohqsg
Never had a thing with merc  but its just an engineering feat,btohqsg
Depends on how hard u drive it la. If u drga race everyday  then yes wear rate is going to be atomical. But once in a while shld be fine,btohqsg
Last hurrah before electrification. I just hope they dont revise the tax structure to phase it out,btohqsg
Haha a very non conventional diesel.,btohqsg
Not just die to turbos  but also complexity of the engine  cheaper materials  amd arguably reduced lifspan of parts so that milk the owners for more money,btohqsg
Exactly. Car makers are finding different ways to milk the owners. Just like bmw subscription. Or gtr r35 locked ecu in the early stage,btohqsg
