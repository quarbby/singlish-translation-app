If the month has 30 days  you need to keep your 28th day credited salary at least $5000 inside. ($5000x3days)/ 30 daysIf the month has 31 days  you need to keep your 28th day credited salary at least $3875 inside. ($3875 x 4 days) / 31 days.Is my calculation correct?Better keep more if the interest you earned is more important,btohqsg
It's based on 31 July balance.And yes you will get interest.. I only put for 10days in cimb and I still get my interest..,btohqsg
Must be zero balance on 31/7/23 and NOT Aug  else is 1.5%  2.5 tier on funds,btohqsg
Thx. The other option is just transfer in $500 on 1st of the month and then don‚Äôt touch it and then I can just withdraw the full pay when it comes in end of the month?,btohqsg

Provided there is no other withdraw during the month  eg. GIRO deduction. Usually I won‚Äôt recommend $500. I suggest $600 instead in case you miss by one day.,btohqsg

Hi  For UOB national savings promo  if I just open an uob one acc today  I just have to make sure 50 000/100 000/200 000 is in my account by 30 sept right? Meaning can I transfer different amount to reach e.g 50 000 by end of sept?,btohqsg
Nice! Can apple gift card be used to pay iCloud subscription?,btohqsg
Make sure your itunes Id SG Account,btohqsg
Hi everyone  may I check if the the minimum spend ($500) for UOB One 3.3% quarterly cash back is calculated based on the transaction posted date? Or  transaction date? Thanks!,btohqsg
I think it is stated in the FAQ. You can google ‚ÄúUob one bonus faq‚Äù to search it.,btohqsg
hi just to confirm  this is the way to credit from DBS -> UOB one to get the credit salary criteria right,btohqsg

You are doing a FAST and not PayNow right?,btohqsg
this is from the dbs fast transfer page  i just keyed in paynow sala under comments  not sure if required ?,btohqsg
I'm not sure because the PAYNOW comment is meant for paynow method. u can confirm using the interest tracker in TMRW app whether you hit the salary credit criteria,btohqsg
The only thing you need to do is set the purpose as Salary Payment. The transaction code will be SALA. You can track it on UOB TMRW app on the next day.,btohqsg
Will the miles earned be able to transfer to krisflyer account?,btohqsg
$25 rebate is in KrisPay miles and non-transferable,btohqsg
Yes. I clicked on Expired and seems to be in the challenge again. ü§™,btohqsg
This is correct  watch out for weekends or ph on 1st,btohqsg
Scheduled FAST transfers should still take place on weekends?,btohqsg
Different bank different rule  I mean source bank,btohqsg
will SCB give cashback for paying M1 bills using the App? I never put it as recurring payment. i am trying to get the free gift from moneysmart. Is the transaction eligible for  Moneysmart?,btohqsg
After being earmarked for UOB national day savings. Will I still earn the interest of full amount in the One Account? Coz seems like the amount earmarked is not shown in the acc ü§î,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúUob one earmark interest‚Äù to search chat history to see what other reply.,btohqsg
Someone already replied. No need one shot.,btohqsg
I want to add that this question has been asked at least once a month and also has been answered at least once a month.If don‚Äôt pay interest which person would go for the earmark‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Common sense is not common ü§£,btohqsg
The answer of this question can be found in Poems smarkpark website FAQ section.,btohqsg
withdrawal is easy but problem is i dont see the 5.8% interest credited yet,btohqsg
Thanks. Will check it out.. The web site is not very intuitive.. üòÖ,btohqsg
Think T&C mentions within 30 days.. Or 30 biz days.. Can't remember..Moomoo also mentions 10 days  but think Moomoo gives the difference within a few days only.. Hope Poems is also that efficient..,btohqsg
I signed up for ocbc titanium CC  if i paired it with amaze to pay for town counsel bill at physical kiosk  does it counts towards the 500 minimum spend i need to clock for the sign up rewards?,btohqsg
I find my UOB solitaire card $3000/mth cap too low for family expenses fighting for 3 solid categories of food  wellness  travel  so currently travel is left out but I am thinking of applying a supplementary card for wife or child 8yr old for travel category and punch the travel miles there. Makes sense? Did I miss out some considerations?,btohqsg
Firstly  you need to check what is the mcc code of the merchants. You can search usinghttps://heymax.aiThen check OCBC Titanium TnC is it in whitelist or exclusion list,btohqsg
Supp card won‚Äôt have additional categories or limit.Use your wife to apply as main.,btohqsg
Solitaire 3k capped is based on posted date and not transacted date right?,btohqsg
Yeah. So far only dbs is based on transaction date.,btohqsg
hey all which is better: Citi rewards + amaze or hsbc ega + hsbc Revolution?,btohqsg
Why not hsbc ega + amaze / crmc,btohqsg
Oh why this combination and not hsbc Revolution!,btohqsg
Amaze + crmc is one of the safest combo. Only travel excluded.,btohqsg
Was thinking since hsbc ega gives 1% cashback it might be better to get the hsbc Revolution with it?,btohqsg
