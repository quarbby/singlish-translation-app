How does asking question this one from what jc,btohqsg
Do you expect me to be online 24/7?,btohqsg
it's more of a you problem in the sgexams study chatswhy do you only pick out a few handful messages from the same few people in those chats to nuke their messages? it's more of wanting to clarify what's your motive or thought process with rigidly handling moderation for community rules  because your so-called moderation isn't consistent all the time (when you're online and looking at the logs  chats etc),btohqsg
and are you not already 24/7 online nuking Geog,btohqsg
Why nuked mine immediately and this soon,btohqsg
u think what short term vs long term,btohqsg
There‚Äôs no criteria‚Äôs here for u to choose,btohqsg
If u can‚Äôt even make ur own standards balance,btohqsg
Then who tf r u to even nuke in the first place,btohqsg
I don't target specific users or messages.,btohqsg
right so we go back to DBWB ok,btohqsg
ok ah so personally as a moderator  stuff like this is okay  as long as it doesn't go off topic,btohqsg
but when it becomes stuff like this is when it's gets on the other side of the line,btohqsg
i wldnt call this relevant too,btohqsg
The original conversation was removed because it turned into an extended conversation about speculating exam questions. That's all that happened.,btohqsg
ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è seems more like people made very inconsistent decisions and ended up salve the situation without trying to escalate or damage reputationbut it does an entirely opposite effect,btohqsg
it's not just a one-time thing alr ah,btohqsg
so what‚Äôs with the nuking when rand clarified what dbwb is,btohqsg
oh is today not another piece  of evidence ?,btohqsg
Like someone asked abt TMUA in the o level chat,btohqsg
@IcedMilois this the standards of sg exams admin?,btohqsg
Someone sends NON SG RELATED EXAM HELP,btohqsg
Even when other people like call them out for giving false info,btohqsg
the other admins have revealed chat moderation evidence and other members have made their stance either as victims or witnesses,btohqsg
PDF for u is it ?,btohqsg
we need to make this a,btohqsg
Whole pdf document issue is it,btohqsg
just a nicer way of saying things i guess,btohqsg
okay i think we can stop the argument here this really doesn't need to happen here,btohqsg
It just happened recently in the o level chat grp,btohqsg
i know we're handling this internally in the mod team,btohqsg
It‚Äôs never going to be settled,btohqsg
ok then V better come up with a,btohqsg
Well elaborated detailed answer w diagram if needed answer,btohqsg
And I refer you to this,btohqsg
todays o level and a level chat is an clear indication,btohqsg
ok uw play this game right,btohqsg
I will literally go through the whole chat and create a pdf,btohqsg
I never deleted anything in the A level chat today,btohqsg
I got all the time for this,btohqsg
Please just stop making vague accusations,btohqsg
"my favorite is still when mango got muted immediately for saying ""Haha"" once off but when other people were talking about olympiads and non a level related stuff they didnt get muted",btohqsg
My arguments are supported with clear evidence,btohqsg
"Again  wrong  they said ""HAHA"" at least seven times in 3 hours",btohqsg
Good Luck to those taking Principles Of Accounting Paper 2!,btohqsg
nvm my brain was not working ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
