I don't understand the cs1010 thing either lol,btohqsg
All I know that it's a very difficult module,btohqsg
And that I'll need to prepare my anus for it,btohqsg
Ah it's Cs10 in decimal I see,btohqsg
*Jumps to science faculty instead*  only to find cs1010s,btohqsg
do u have cs kids spec-ing in sec?,btohqsg
Rather take it as a 2nd major instead,btohqsg
The module's around half infosec half cs,btohqsg
was thinking of spec-ing in sec,btohqsg
But honestly the security modules esp the practical part quite underwhelming,btohqsg
I really need to go and check on the available specialisations,btohqsg
You must specialise in 1 focus area,btohqsg
i was thinking of swe + sec  but idk what's the ideal path for it  cuz while i was planning  it seems that i'll need to take an extra mod outside of req,btohqsg
Ya and i need to learn what the flying fk is planck constant and schrodinger's equation,btohqsg
