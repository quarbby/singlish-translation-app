maybe only use up the $250 every month of jipay every month. Just kind of confusing seem like many merchants does not get the 1.5%,btohqsg
Just make use of the $250 grab... otherwise its surely gonna get nerf'd by this year,btohqsg
full 1.2% only if you are Platinum in grab,btohqsg
Hi there  what is the best card to get to pair with Amaze for travel spending ? I saw one of the previous videos recommending Citi cash back but that‚Äôs mainly for groceries and petrol  but are there any recommendations for more casual purchases ?,btohqsg
DBS WWMC cannot use for Fave pay  utility bill companies: like singtel  starhub  TPG and viewquest. So any others option?,btohqsg
Haha you have the same question as mine,btohqsg
haha yeah I think I saw the reply,btohqsg
looking for a male friendly option haha,btohqsg
DBS WWMC used to be the best option even for males  but it just explicitly excluded AMAZE spending. Quite sad,btohqsg
yeah  I‚Äôm leaning towards Citi just because of Amaze. My initial plan was to get both the Citi Premier Miles and Citi Rewards. Citi Premier miles to get sign on bonus (15k + 10k annual premium payment)  and overseas spending when needed and Citi Rewards for local spending,btohqsg
Singtel Starhub Viewquest should be able ah? It's not classified under Utilities like SP Services isn't it,btohqsg
oic  because i see on the category classified under bills  utility and taxes  thanks,btohqsg
I remember my Starhub M1 bills all got points,btohqsg
üëçthanks a lot  so only SP bill is excluded,btohqsg
What you get for the sign on bonus?,btohqsg
right now direct from Citi website for the Citi Premier Miles card you‚Äôll get 15k miles after $800 spending for 2 months.,btohqsg
Only for new users I guess?,btohqsg
Nice May I know if I book agoda for flights and hotel do I get 4 miles? Cause I don‚Äôt understand if I need to book through a link or smth to get the Citi promotion miles,btohqsg
jipay account sign up seems dodgy and collects so much personal information - probably resell our data  any advantage remaining for jipay?,btohqsg
Any sign up gift from jipay?,btohqsg
Btw this is $800 within the 2 moths right?,btohqsg
the target are domestic helpers and children,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm right one you‚Äôre paying the annual fee of $197 another is opting out of it,btohqsg
depends  but I would say it‚Äôs worth,btohqsg
does UOB evol tracking go by statement month or calender month?,btohqsg
Don't worry man  this is a feature of going public,btohqsg
I will just continue providing value for this community,btohqsg
Think different: if every one agrees with what you do  then you're doing something boring enough,btohqsg
Dk if can complain pdpa if data was declared to be used as KYC purposes alone ü§î,btohqsg
Has the revolut Cashback for this month come in yet?,btohqsg

Any good method to waive annual for UOB amex absolute?,btohqsg
Hmm no more 1.5% Cashback from jipay? Didn't see it on their website or app,btohqsg

Huh? Not China bah? The founder is actually a Ukrainian lol,btohqsg
Hey Chris  just wanted to say not to take in too much negativity from the public. If anything  im pretty sure the community we have here appreciate everything you've put up for us,btohqsg
1st Aug jipay will be totally useless.,btohqsg
I mean to be frank  it's pretty useless the moment they clawed all the EZ Link cashback üòÇ,btohqsg
Hi guys. I just opened TDA and try to sell option. Any idea what is the exchange referring to? What should i select?,btohqsg
Oh may I know how much you spent in total? My one still under 1 year‚Ä¶,btohqsg
