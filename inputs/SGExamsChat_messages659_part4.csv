for students to write like 3 examples per para cuz alot of schs are like hehe my students cannot memorise,btohqsg
usu just 1 example per para enuf,btohqsg
but cambridge actually did say before that stronger responses are characterised by a wide range of examples,btohqsg
But how to complete on time,btohqsg
yeah but issue i find is that most are just regurgitating rather than actually unpacking the examples,btohqsg
ok but my misunderstanding here is that i thought 3 examples was... little/just nice,btohqsg
i think wide range normally refers to across space and time,btohqsg
like if u give me 3 examples in the same country,btohqsg
i mean thats not really a wide range,btohqsg
because most model essays i have seen are whole paragraphs full of examples no explanation then simi,btohqsg
So normally what I do is,btohqsg
i will write 1/2/3 example per continent (bar antartica),btohqsg
normally what i do is ... ''do 1 time good one''@chemcer,btohqsg
DC and LDC if possible right,btohqsg
get the A then zao  never come back,btohqsg
i mean it's more of giving enough examples that lend credibility to your argument on a larger scale/scope,btohqsg
just do 1 time good one bro,btohqsg
must make sure you fluke on that day itself,btohqsg
im too lazy to teach gp,btohqsg
when i used to teach gp,btohqsg
idk i feel like if schs just focused on actually teaching skills,btohqsg
my fren went for her first few RI GP lectures/tutorials,btohqsg
the techniques of GP to get B is damn straightforward,btohqsg
"""memorise this entire infopack we do test next week""",btohqsg
ya but people still cant get B,btohqsg
and B by SG standards is normally an A,btohqsg
uhh A is normally u just need get full marks for the entire SAQ + Summary portion,btohqsg
i mean A takes a bit more thought on how you use your content la,btohqsg
then write a semi passable essay (30ish),btohqsg
but if you got decent technique with your content dump you can get a B easily,btohqsg
bro we are all over a level why we still talking about it,btohqsg
Saq is so badly done in internal exams,btohqsg
also seeing a lot of people's summaries make me wanna puke,btohqsg
A lot of ppl get less than 10/17,btohqsg
actually just in general seeing how they paraphrase,btohqsg
I have consistently gotten higher for AQ than SAQ,btohqsg
I had a paper before where i lost,btohqsg
All my marks in the paper 2 in SAQ,btohqsg
hmm idk about my mentee but their paper 1 prep does seem to be just going topic by topic. like they do do some stuff to teach how to plan the essays out properly but it's not drilled enough like content is,btohqsg
and plan doesn't translate to writing skill,btohqsg
its only 1h 30min a week man,btohqsg
ya she consulted her tutor for like 3 essays recently,btohqsg
Do you think Cambridge is more lenient when it comes to marking saq,btohqsg
rn she's like high B close to A,btohqsg
so p sure she can hit it,btohqsg
bro you assuming that jc kids can reflect so well,btohqsg
is she okay to send me her essays,btohqsg
i can see where she goes wrong also,btohqsg
if they can  you wouldnt be here talking about gp A,btohqsg
do yall have like 1.5-2h breaks,btohqsg
