for me 10mins not enough de  i go kranji one at least 2-4 sessions,btohqsg
I guess I'll just go for 10 mins one then if I had free time I enjoy myself karting etc. I wanna go for the drifting one but it was close down,btohqsg
Trust me u few laps u will shag alr. Unless u stamina high like@meekiaganHAHA,btohqsg

Probably the one who set 52s lap time have a good entry and exit at the corners.,btohqsg
Pretty sure they also have good racing lines,btohqsg
but their karts is also by manual adjustment one  so some karts is faster some slower,btohqsg
just go in and enjoy and have fun can le,btohqsg
dont think of fatest lap or what and endanger yourself and other driverthe course can be quite narrow,btohqsg
that time i went to kranji one  no license can play 30 only  i see the group of ppl they exit pit they block the exit cus they waiting for their friends behind ü•≤,btohqsg
Yeah. I got no intention to set a fastest lap. Some more it's my first time to try karting and gain an experience.,btohqsg

Who need drift kart when you can bless for small puddle and start whipping your rear,btohqsg
but it really tests ur skills,btohqsg
For real. It's actually hard to control your kart once it starts skidding,btohqsg
tried once snd would never again. unless the rain stop le then puddles are cleared. track a little damp still ok,btohqsg
