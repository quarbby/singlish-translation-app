well depends what the buyer wants if you ask me.You want a  good handling car to go to the track  for sure megane rs.You want a car that will comfortably sit a family of 5 that is pretty fast  than giulia veloce will be more suitable,btohqsg
It really depends on what the buyer wants,btohqsg
1.8 road tax low solid choice there,btohqsg
if you wanna sit workshop everyday  buy subie,btohqsg
And how deep is your pocket,btohqsg

if you track the megane RS alot  for sure your maint cost is gonna be much higher compared to a giulia!,btohqsg
Not too bad from what I've heard  of course if you go bonkers with tuning and hardware changes  will sacrifice reliability,btohqsg
