Would like to share my exp for SC manhattan. There was 1 yr i was charged the annual fee. Called to waive  failed. Talked to CSO and it failed. I said then i would have to cancel the card. But i had credit (cashback money) still sitting in there unused. CSO waived the fee and told me to wait 1 more mth then call in to cancel again. I never called in to cancel. I only cancelled it much later. I forgot how long i kept the card for,btohqsg
oh no.. SCB Manhattan is limited edition and one of the best cards for infrequent large expenditure.. and very good to pair with Amaze for overseas spending.,btohqsg
Need to clock 3k sgd for 3% cashback lol,btohqsg
Actually one tip I have for you all is try to get yourself onto SCB Priority Banking. Firstly  their esaver has frequent promotions which give above average interest rates. Secondly  by being on SCB Priority Banking  you get fee waiver on most items except the unwaivable credit cards. Thirdly  you get free Priority Pass by holding the SCB Priority Banking Visa Infinite.,btohqsg
Apart from my wedding and honeymoon  i dont spend so much  havent factor in the exclusions,btohqsg
yeah infrequent large expenditure. Like booking air tickets and hotels.In fact  if not for SCB Manhattan  I don't know how to pay for my air ticket and hotels bookings. The free miles card don't have enough spend quota.,btohqsg
Ocbc short charge me 0.5% interest on my 365 account. Should I go post on their Facebook page? They did not count my scoot flight spenting.,btohqsg

I wonder did they pay me the 0.3% for my scoot ü§£,btohqsg
With UOB lady solitaire card  you can earn 6mpd on travel n air ticket   max $3k/month. If you value 1.5 cents per mile  that is 9% of rewards per dollar.   You may want to check if your expenses can meet the card criteria.,btohqsg

Have a question for sifus. If i buy phone from samsung website using their installment  does it fall under installment plan exclusions for credit cards,btohqsg
yeah we did look at this card and we arrived at about 2.7% cashback equivalent (if convert UNI$ to cashback). That is lower than manhattan 3% cashback.But the miles earn does indeed look good and it is something that my household is considering if we venture into using miles.https://milelion.com/2023/03/20/explained-which-mccs-are-included-in-the-uob-ladys-card-travel-category/,btohqsg

Hi guys  need some assistance.. I am currently in Taiwan right now and I‚Äôve been using my Amaze + CRMC for my spending. However  ytd evening onwards I started to encounter rejected transaction even though my CRMC limit is still available. Anyone encountered the same issue?,btohqsg
We just applied. Thanks for the tip. First year is free anyway.Chose:FashionTravelWe checked no promo for existing UOB card members.,btohqsg
If you are paying MCST fees  note that only the following can be paid by citi payall,btohqsg
How do you arrived at 2.7%?,btohqsg
Usually we don‚Äôt use miles to redeem shopping vouchers as the conversion rate is not attractive.  Miles is much better if you use it to redeem air ticket.,btohqsg

Hi all the Gurus  can someone share with me the best way to move USD from broker A to broker B? How to best reduce the loss of currency conversion since I need to keep in USD as well.,btohqsg
I dont have the full list. But from what i know cimb is free for incoming and outgoing USD transfershttps://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/help-support/rates-charges/fees-charges/remittance.html,btohqsg
Oic. Miles chasers usually don‚Äôt use miles to redeem shopping voucher because the conversion rate is not good.If your expenses can hit $600 per month  UOB Evol offers better cashback.Evol for online spend $380 :$250 x 8% = $20$130 x 0.3% = $0.39.Which equal to 5.36% cashback provided hit min $600 spend per month.,btohqsg
what is broker A and broker B?if they themselves have cheap FX transaction fees.. you can consider:Exchange USD into SGD in Broker A. Transfer SGD back to your SGD bank. Transfer SGD into Broker B. Exchange SGD into USD.End up  the FX transaction fees for USD/SGD (a very tight currency pair) could just be a few dollars.Caveat: you should perform the USD/SGD buy and sell at the same time to avoid FX fluctuations.,btohqsg
The main issue is transfer of USD usually results in a USD10 fee being deducted by the Correspondent Bank and there is no way to avoid this from what I know.,btohqsg
