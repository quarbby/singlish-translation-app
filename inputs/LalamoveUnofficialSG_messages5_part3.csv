Esp bike food order  multi drop. All condo. Zzzz,btohqsg
Maybe i go rent one bike 40km/litre more worth it,btohqsg
I thinking we car 10-12km/litre do all these bike order. Minus your mileage for maintenance   battery tyre engine oil. Did we really earn?,btohqsg
No u still think of your petrol,btohqsg
Got job got money in can liao,btohqsg
But not as much as bike ah,btohqsg
Think we everyday share how much we do here,btohqsg
I create one spreadsheet to calculate,btohqsg
Do 1 trip 12km is 1litres. So must minus $1.99 liao,btohqsg
But nvr incli maintenance all those,btohqsg
I think it unnecessary. Because it's based on many factors and we don't only do llm. So it's not a fair comparison,btohqsg
Worked about 6 hrs a day,btohqsg
No bro just wanted to see if rly earn ah,btohqsg
About $10/hr i also est ard there,btohqsg
But I share only llm trips here. It makes sense that way lor,btohqsg
Minus my brake pad all. Maybe $7/hr,btohqsg
How is every one sales now?,btohqsg

I got nothing at Hougang since 8,btohqsg
Haha boringgg.. i shall drive around and look at people,btohqsg
@Lalamovepls improve your apps. Really sux,btohqsg
I think is ppl too fast. Auto clickers. Not because of the apps.,btohqsg
Bro i just got 1 from bencoolen back to hougang $13 gross,btohqsg
I only realised how fast the order flies off the shelf after joining lalamove,btohqsg
Minus tyre and servicing I think only left $5/hr.... Worse than macdonald,btohqsg
Plus risk of summon and accident,btohqsg
So many. Which apps u suggest?,btohqsg
