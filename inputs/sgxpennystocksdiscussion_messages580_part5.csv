üöÄPika World on DemandüöÄ‚åõÔ∏èOur Greatest FearüèÄStocks plunged on Tuesday after Uncle Powell spoke on the idea of speeding up the bond tapering to combat inflation. It comes at a sensitive time when the market is worried about the Omicron variant. Equities reacted aggressively. The Dow dropped by 1.9% together with S&P 500. Nasdaq fell by 1.6%.ü•âA weak Footingüí∏The market was already jittered when major vaccine producers discussed the weaker effect of vaccines and treatment against the Omicron variant. The sell-off accelerated as Uncle Powell spoke in the Senate Banking Committee on the possible discussion in December on tapering momentum.üí∞Dollar Hintüí≥10 years treasury yield had fallen to 1.42%  the lowest on the day and recovered to 1.44% after tapering news. The dollar movement perhaps hints at the market‚Äôs guess on a faster tapering. When bond yields fall  the US dollar often weakens as well as investors purchase fewer dollars when the US bonds become less juicy.Although the US Dollar index fell by 0.4% on the day  it is still above the intraday low. The sudden rise reflects market participants seeing US bond yields moving higher as the Fed starts to buy lesser bonds which could theoretically press down bond prices and push up yields.üíéRussell 2000üíéThe favourite of Pika World Russell 2000 is perhaps on the pivotal point towards correction. It is down about 9% from its high in early November. Small caps tend to be more sensitive to economic demand  and therefore  tapering if it leads to reduced demand tend to have a more pronounced impact on the index.Pika World maintains cautious bull on the market.We hope you enjoy this read! Pika World will be back with you on the next big move.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

Later in the evening  a report by Channel 12 said the Pfizer vaccine is just slightly less effective in preventing infection with Omicron than with Delta ‚Äì 90% as opposed to 95% ‚Äì while it is as effective ‚Äì around 93% ‚Äì in preventing serious symptoms at least for those vaccinated with a booster.,btohqsg
According to the report  the ability of the variant to infect is higher than Delta but not as much as feared ‚Äì around 1.3 times higher,btohqsg
Not sure their health minister is like us not a doc nor scientist.. They talk accdg to what expert told them,btohqsg
Short term effect seems mild for omicron  not lethal. Now is for researcher to study long term effects which need times.,btohqsg
Bad news if u holding ppes,btohqsg

"BioNTech CEO says vaccine likely to protect against severe Covid from Omicron1. BioNTech and Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine will likely offer strong protection against any severe disease from the new Omicron virus variant  BioNTech's chief executive told Reuters  as the firm weighs the need to upgrade its commonly used shot.2. Lab tests are underway over the next 2 weeks to analyse the blood of people who had 2 or 3 doses of BioNTech's Comirnaty vaccine to see if antibodies found in that blood inactivate Omicron  shedding light on whether new vaccines are needed.3. ""We think it's likely that people will have substantial protection against severe disease caused by Omicron "" said BioNTech CEO and co-founder Ugur Sahin. He specified severe disease as requiring hospital or intensive care.More here",btohqsg
