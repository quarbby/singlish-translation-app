May I know how do I do that?,btohqsg
Previously was paying when the statement was out only,btohqsg
U can use ur usual method of paying... No need to wait for statement to come out,btohqsg
Alright thanks. I just use the same way of paying the statement right,btohqsg
U can refer to the unbilled part in ur statement to see how much you've spent...,btohqsg
But it’s only good for the 1st $1k or just whack only?,btohqsg
Atm  CRMC + amaze gives most bang for buck due to 10x rewards on online spend  provided non excluded MCC...,btohqsg
visa is a no no as revolut adding 1.5% when use to top uponly MC can top up without feebut mostly topup credit card dont have any cascback points,btohqsg
Thanks. What abt MC to Amaze to Revolut? I do regular transfer to overseas for family members so using Revolut for this.,btohqsg
Stop using revolut since they stop the simplyGo promo for existing customers. Will just finish using the money inside when go JB,btohqsg
Will be using Amaze + citi cashback+ for all my overseas sending,btohqsg
1.Crmc with amaze2. Trust bankTrust debit also gives you 0 withdrawal fee. Don't need the rest.,btohqsg
Amaze works with most MC. Just that CRMC offer 4mpd with Amaze. I pair with UOBKF and UOB Prvi as well for travel related transactions such as hotel spend and local transportation,btohqsg
Direct MC will do  going through amaze dont give extra benefit. Think revoult mcc should be excluded,btohqsg
Okie. So tat means TopUp to amaze thru MC doesn’t give any cash rebates too?,btohqsg
All top up dont earn rebate,btohqsg
yea those top up to amaze by visa no points,btohqsg
only direct use via linked with mastercard,btohqsg
think only amazme can link to google pay not apple or samsug pay if want to skip carry the phycial card,btohqsg
look like this are the recommeded one,btohqsg
guess if hsbc revlution is a MC is can be a good choice too as no min spend,btohqsg
Does anyone know if top up to grab wallet using uob absolute still get cashback?,btohqsg
Does anyone know the process of hsbc revolution claiming cashback or miles? is it troublesome?,btohqsg
cashback is nearly instantly after submit it will reflect on next bill deduction,btohqsg
Can i know what is your credit card strategy? Im trying to find a strategy that is easy to keep track and doesnt involve alot of spending.,btohqsg
if you want high cachback usually comees with a caveat,btohqsg
min spend to meet or  catagory need to meet so need to see which cards fits u and you want to do homework,btohqsg
If my renovation contractor doesn't accredit card  what methods are there to utilize credit card to pay reno? I don't mind a fee  if its still worthwhile.,btohqsg
Can Citibank cashback+ use to top up Youtrip?,btohqsg
Or should I replace Youtrip with Amaze?,btohqsg
Hi all  can I ask if anyone know that using WMW or Citi Reward on shopback food and hawker payment would earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone encountered issues with Kris+ app payment ? Recently I am unable to make payment after selecting the credit card. Press continue but nothing happens. Sometime can sometimes unable to. Weird,btohqsg
Don’t think you get Cashback by topping up to youtrip,btohqsg
CRMC can be used with liquid pay for 4mpd. Else can use FairPrice app to pay at selected KPT outlet,btohqsg
Does anyone know if UOB Evol get cashback from starhub and utlity bills?,btohqsg
Hmm.. what is the alternative if still want to continue using Youtrip instead of amaze?,btohqsg
I’m using both amaze and youtrip. Both linked to my citi cashback+ but only amaze can get cashback,btohqsg
Yes it is considered as online payment,btohqsg
I'll think youtrip is safer  since you can topup only what you need. And Youtrip allow you to convert first and store  that's what a lot of my friends is doing to Japan Yen.,btohqsg
Youtrip same as Revo u can lock down the rate if u go over seas,btohqsg
If u see rate good u buylow and keep it,btohqsg
But Revo has weekend 1% fee  small amount. but it feels like Revo has no purpose anymore,btohqsg
Don't top up on weekends lah,btohqsg
Pay now to top up Youtrip  no point using cc to top up Youtrip.I use :- Youtrip/ Revolut- Amaze + CCfor me  I find that amaze give better rewards,btohqsg
Usually u don't suddenly go overseas If fly far so u can ppan on weekdays buy low yen examples,btohqsg
I chalk up $300 SGD buy low yen and spend when I go jp,btohqsg
Ok thanks guys for the information,btohqsg
I tried amaze + cc for my trip to japan,btohqsg
In the end I got net about 1.7% cashbackThough forex markup was high and not worth it,btohqsg
Revolut spend with 1% cashback would have been better for me (since I have metal),btohqsg
