What‚Äôs the saying‚Ä¶buy high sell low üòÇ,btohqsg
Ya  that is how people earn money  by reaping off those buy high sell low,btohqsg
You should only buy into what you actually understand. Not just because some stranger online says you should üòâ,btohqsg

All investment is about human emotional to be honest,btohqsg
This time crypto rally is different.Bitcoin is making ATH purely becoz of etf approvals in US  see other major altcoins they are not even near to their ATH.Bitcoin is the only one of safest among all  see big Institutions are investing it legally after SEC approval.Stock  gold they already have some %of portfolio of total investment  now money is chasing bitcoin to grab some pie of that portion.,btohqsg
Hi gurus. May I ask if anyone knows if tuition enrichment fee (Write connection) is it excluded from UOB one account as valid spending?I paid on 7th  posted on 8th  but today I check  the ticker in my app is still not moving. Does the ticker move on the posted day or the next working day after the posted day?,btohqsg
There is last update date on the tracker. Compare the last update date first.,btohqsg

Hi  may I know what‚Äôs a good card to use when buying air tickets in foreign currency?,btohqsg
Amaze + Uob lady card with travel category,btohqsg
If u dun have uob lady card  what the alternative card for booking air tix?,btohqsg
There isn‚Äôt any close competitor. Hence Uob lady is such a gem jewel precious diamond when it came up with travel 6mpd $3k cap.Even 4mpd $2k cap is still appreciated after 1st April,btohqsg
depends on which airline u are taking as well and how much u are spending in total for air tix,btohqsg
If lets say for SIA  any alternative? Does budget carrier have diff strategy?,btohqsg
Hi any suggestion for cc to spend $800 mthly on EYS clinic?,btohqsg
Hi is there comparison for BlackRock s&p 500 vs amundi prime usa fund for srs>endowus investment?,btohqsg
he did talk about the fees etc  what other comparison u asking about ?,btohqsg
S&P 500 is slightly less diversified  it contains only large cap but amundi prime contains large + mid cap. But diversification usually has an inverse relationship with risk/return  so depends what you're looking for.Fees-wise they're very close.,btohqsg
Can one pay another credit card bill with another card?,btohqsg
Anyone tried to buy Klook vouchers at ShopBack $500 size? What‚Äôs the mcc?,btohqsg
Hi everyone. If any one knows whats the reason why a credit spending is not moving the ticker of the uob app?I paid for tuition fee for my son..Or where shd i go to ask uob?,btohqsg
Possible to use empty Amaze wallet to try out?,btohqsg
I thought of doing so but if someone already did it then can just be 100% sure.Problem is I have heard of cases where the tested mcc for big sizes is 5812. Then after posted it is 7299 (the usual mcc for small sizes).,btohqsg
SIA lets say u are spending $2k u can opt for the UOB KF cc which gives u uncapped 3mpd,btohqsg
however u can break up the spending into different bookings and utilise all the 6mpd/4mpd cards such as the Ladys card and WWC until the capped amt,btohqsg
Maybe it fall under education mcc that is excluded spending,btohqsg
Hi for amaze card using overseas  is it similar to youtrip transferwise where the fx rate would be shown live right after the transaction was done?,btohqsg
Hi guys apology for the following silly question but bobian really new to bitcoin. Unsure if it works like stock.üòö1)If I buy at 70k now and its dropped to 20k  does it mean I wld incur a paper loss of 50k + margin/card deposits fee/comfee etc?2) Where did the 50k gone? Disappeared in cyber space or like a zero sum game where the market maker or manipulator wld receive the 50k gain?3) Any recommended platform to buy bitcoin?,btohqsg
what card you use to pay ?,btohqsg
cards like uob amex are excluded from the spending tracker to be awarded for the bonus interest   if that is what you're referring to,btohqsg
It works like stock  except that there aren't any real physical assets backing it up üòâ1) Yes of course. Same as any other traded entity.2) It's pretty much zero sum. But does it really matter whether the lost value disappears for good  or whether it has gone into the hands of a market manipulator?,btohqsg
substitute bitcoin with gold and you will get your answer?,btohqsg
"2) the ""50k"" could just disappear   if today people value it at 100k  but the next day the buyers value it at 10k  the value will just be down to 10k.So i would say its value is dependent on how much people value the bitcoin   which is different from assets like gold which is a tangible asset. bitcoin is a non-tangible asset as its backed by nothing but by ""belief"" . its like money   if nobody believes in its value   the currency drops tremendously",btohqsg
More seller than buyers = price drop,btohqsg
I am thinking value of bitcoin won't just disappear into cyber space..but became profit for those who sell below 70K? Getting confused,btohqsg
Was thinking bitcoin kena short selling by whales wld b getting more frequent,btohqsg
technically the value can just disappear if nobody values it but thats quite the extreme case,btohqsg
just make sure u know whats your risk tolerance level before getting into bitcoin   as its volatile,btohqsg
My number 1 rule in investment  u can afford to lose all and it will not affect your lifestyle,btohqsg
Heard if Internet down or during nuclear war? Other wise shall subject to demand supply,btohqsg
If ur investment goes to zero and it will affect u then u not suitable to do the investment.,btohqsg
if you are interested in knowing how bitcoin works   can try googling for how does bitcoin work,btohqsg
BTC is backed by the mining network that is securing the protocol.,btohqsg
Googling is easy. But that's why we value input here. Especially those with useful comment ‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg
cannot really explain fully   cause bitcoin is quite a complicated subject,btohqsg
Fundamental of investing is power by human emotion  fear and greed. Bitcoin is just an investment tools like other investment. So why some can hold and gain while other panic and lose,btohqsg
Nothing will working during these scenarios.,btohqsg
U can try balance transfer  bank do run zero percent balance transfer at time.,btohqsg
Only physical gold will work then,btohqsg
