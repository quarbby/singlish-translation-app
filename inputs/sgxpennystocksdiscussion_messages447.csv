Vividthree - Bottom Picking- currently (Opened $0.041 as of 20th Nov 2020).Background- looks to have found bottomed at $0.035 to $0.040- Most of the liquidity level at $0.07 & $0.08- On Sept 30  Vividthree Holdings chairman and independent director Ho Choon Hou (non residence ambassador to United Mexican States  Co-founder of Cordlife  principal at Southern Capital Group Pte Ltd  a private equity firm   acquired 11 090 400 shares of the Catalist-listed company for a consideration of S$776 328 at $0.070 per share and took his total interest in Vividthree Holdings to 3.32 per cent.- Ron Sim invested $2million at $0.215- IPO in 2018 was at $0.25 per share- the last time it bottomed at current downtrend channel  it went back up to $0.080 pretty quick. Recently  it touched the downtrend channel again and the set up is similar to the last time.- they announced placement  $2 million at $0.126 earlier Feb2020 but SGX  blocked as they still had money from IPO. But now they might have used up most and I believe they will fry back to $0.07 to $0.09 range (same level where they did big amount of married deals) and retry to do another placement perhaps $0.07 to $0.08 to raise funds for their ongoing collaborations/ventures.- Selling pressure is very minimal at current prices as most of the investors are stuck at IPO prices ($0.25) or earlier investors at $0.15 to $0.20.- Business scope includes Virtual Reality  Content Creation  Gaming Events  VR events like Train to Busan at RWSWhy Buy?- Bottomed out and we are buying cheaper than Dr Hou at $0.070- They tried to raise capital by doing placement at price of at least $0.126 but SGX blocked. Hence  they will likely fry up prices to do a placement close to $0.080 IMO- Several announcements of new collaborations with Resurgence (gaming)  NTUC-related subsidiairy etc. shows management adapting to recent covid19 circumstance. Should be expecting more catalyst in time to comeTarget Price:Short term target (Should be soon) - $0.070 to $0.080 Range (which is close to what Dr Hou bought in and a likely placement price),btohqsg
This one last time when I called out for Vv3  it managed to run to 79 I think in 2 weeks,btohqsg
Recap - Vividthree back then when I mentioned in 2020. Those who want to understand VV3 can read this,btohqsg
I tried VV3 again $0.053. Vamos. DYODD!,btohqsg
Calling all BBs on VV3 👍,btohqsg
SG Mid-Day Top Volume Leader BoardLHN led the gainers up 18.9% and continued to break all time high  raised $2.2m from placement at $0.3351 per shares  CFM continued to break all time high again  rallying since recently announced pharma startup acquisition  Hanwell broke month high after early morning married deal 68m shares at $0.42 each  Samudera broke 10-year high  tracking global shipping stocks rallyMore here!,btohqsg
wat is vv3 safe price ah?,btohqsg
Cement no heavy weight BB support hard to push up.,btohqsg
Trading punters can only push up till 0.042 at max,btohqsg
50s range are considered ok  best if 40+  I myself got some stuck in 60 plus range 😂,btohqsg
@SgYuanPls help to plot chart LHN. TQ,btohqsg
VV3 looks alright but not sure whether they got enough power to break 58 clean. If it does not MM will remove liquidity and flush new players whilst they collect back closer to 5 +/- cent . For me   if they really want to play  they will break 58 clean and fast and then once past 62  game starts. Thats when it will be easier to play.Just issue a friendly warning as this one easily can get stucked when they play the range.Good thing is there is players but when they really want to break out.  we never know. However  if MM2 carries on its form  i believe this one will follow!,btohqsg
👍  I am prepare to hold for awhile if range bound..,btohqsg
Okay I have alot of this one. Hope BBs finally play it up,btohqsg
Did a little digging on the most recent Vividthree insider purchaseOn 29th Sept 2020.- Dr Ho Choon Hou   independent director purchased approx. 11 million shares of Vividthree  married deal at $0.070 on 29th Sept 2020So who is this guy ?He is :- Co-Founder of Cordlife- Singapore Non resident Ambassador to New Mexico States- Southern Capital Private Equity CEO- Astute investor.(Shown from his recent win 2019 singmedical  sold off some stake at $0.605 taking back about $10m   most of his initial purchases was at $0.175 or lower. )https://blog.spiking.com/sophisticated-investor-profile-dr-ho-choon-hou-8f40648475d0,btohqsg

I’m sure there are still believers,btohqsg
For glove  its a game of volume since ASP is going down.,btohqsg
They did a revaluation and their net profit look swee. But when u zoom into cash flow. The cash flow is weak.,btohqsg

Procurement or buyer cheapo. Always go for lowest price.They are price sensitive. Lol,btohqsg
Everything moves in cyclesExtreme pessimism to extreme optimismWhen the COVID pandemic disrupted supply chains and has no idea on actual situationThey buy more to stock up and rather err on side of caution. ASP shot through the roof. The medical companies best terms ever since inceptionClearly  in good times  all felt it will last forever. Getting better in fact. ASP gets higher by the day  the demand surge exponentially and great wealth is created.,btohqsg
Logic states it will not last forever. What then,btohqsg
Demand drop or maintainSupply ramp up to capitalize on the high ASPEcons 101 states the equilibrium will shift to lower price to drain supply and increase demand,btohqsg
The recent India surge in casesThe medical stocks collectively just did a dead cat bounceThe moment India situation improve slightly  all COVID medicals got dumpedThis depicts a clear shift in smart money out of this industry.
