Citi premier if for miles  citi cashback plus if for cashback,btohqsg
Which card to use for ikea,btohqsg
Actually Expedia can also play this split booking game.I did it for the Citi Expedia 30% last round too. But this one not me going I only help people book so I not so hard core (I remember Citi Expedia the code finishes in 3 minutes. Can only snag one booking each round),btohqsg
amex got 10% statement credit offer currently but lower mpd,btohqsg
Ok anyway. My point is.Isnâ€™t Expedia normal (non hard core splitting grabbing code means) booking cheaper than agoda with no cbf nonsense?Why many prefer agoda?,btohqsg
U pay extra 59 for 1560 extra miles which i think is ex if u ask me,btohqsg
How much is Citi agoda if donâ€™t play the split booking game,btohqsg
Why i dont do spilting lol  it is just the same way to same purpose.,btohqsg
Agoda often run 15-18 percent off for dbs and ocbc  maybank  uob 8 percent citibank 20 percent  mastercard 12 percent etc. Just pay the game to your own benefit,btohqsg
Oh ok. The agoda Citibank 20% no need camp. Not hard.,btohqsg
not sure if agoda better for budget hotels but usually have the most rooms available for 3 stars & below and priced lowest  my philosophy is the room just to sleep so i just get the cheapest possible private room ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
But if not getting for myself i wont try so hard haha  just wrack the most miles u get will do,btohqsg
Yeah this one not for myself. So I just do one single booking.,btohqsg
Expedia is not always cheaper  for example hotels for my Taiwan trips Agoda andtrip.comoffer better price. I usually compare price betweentrip.com  Expedia and Agoda (accounting got 1% DCC) and see which one is cheaper.,btohqsg
Yeah usually I compare all 3 too!!!! But I usually end up with Expedia!!!!,btohqsg
Maybe because I donâ€™t have agoda status they give me lousy price,btohqsg
Sometime direct booking with hotel is better haha,btohqsg
I got 3-4 booking at each hotel for my coming trip to japan  i just call them to inform them so i get to be in one room for the whole stay haha. This is just to be 100 percent sure. But i rmb when i go taiwan  the receptionist straight away pull out 4 booking for me to sign.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Taiwan receptionist happy to combine my 3 single day bookings into 1 ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
Yeah I linked bookings for my Japan trip when I camped the Citi 30% Expedia promo. Tedious doubt I will do again. I had to do 4 cycles to make 4 bookings.,btohqsg
Nobody tried Citi Prestige 4th night free?,btohqsg
Agoda dont need to camp so that why,btohqsg
Yes it is quite competitive when u stay exactly 4 nights,btohqsg
Uob ppv  UOB vs  crmc + amaze  heymax vouchers then bazillion cards to use,btohqsg
Does healthhub bill payment still qualify towards the tiered cashback for maybank visa plat?,btohqsg
My favourite HeyMax card right now is HSBC Live+ for 8% till end of December 2024.,btohqsg
If HSBC Live+ donâ€™t extend the 3% extra cash back  it will become interesting also.The cap becomes $5k per quarter. Can accommodate some larger purchases,btohqsg
No. If HSBC live+ donâ€™t extend. Abandon it.Go for dcs flex cashback.,btohqsg
5% cashback for those categories is lousy.,btohqsg
All not sleeping tonight Hor. All waiting 12am any website update? Hahaha,btohqsg
I think not updated because promotion is still valid till 31 October?,btohqsg
Just got notification that DCS card can add on ApplePay,btohqsg
Let's go to bed everyone. We check again at 9am.,btohqsg
Has anyone calculated before on the HSBC EGA 30-day rule for fresh funds? Is it enforced?,btohqsg
"Sorry. May I check if HSBC EGA acct has any fall below fee if you are a premier account?I opt for the 15k inward transfer option to get premier acct. Does it make me exempted from the fall below fee?(I have received this from CSO when i asked  not sure if its true.. ""I would like to share that there will be a Minimum Account Balance Fee of  S$50 per month. This is  charged only if Total Relationship Balance  falls below S$200 000. Total Relationship Balance  includes deposits  investments and/or insurance"")",btohqsg
no fall below fee. the15k inward transfer would have fulfilled the Total Relationship Balance requirement,btohqsg
Hi all  if I applied for the citi promo (singsaver)  but citi side haven't approved yet after deadline of 31st Oct  do I still get the rewards if the application goes through eventually?,btohqsg
I donâ€™t have such experience with Agoda,btohqsg
Can use lady card when category is travel?,btohqsg

Depends on who you are traveling with  and what is the travel goal,btohqsg
