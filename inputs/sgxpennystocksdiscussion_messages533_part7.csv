Top Glove FY2021 results.1. EPS of 7.59 vs 14.53 Q4/21 vs Q4/202. This amounts to a total dividend of 5.4 sen per share  comprising a final dividend of 3.8 sen per share and a special dividend of 1.6 sen per share. The ex date for the dividend is 1 October 2021  while the payment date is 15 October 2021.3. Performance was also affected by the Enhanced Movement Control Order (EMCO) during which the glove industry in the state of Selangor was not allowed to operate for 10 days  which involved 50% of Top Glove‚Äôs factories; as well as a subsequent round of the Movement Control Order during which the affected facilities were only permitted to operate at 60%. The reduced output adversely impacted utilisation  driving costs upward.More here,btohqsg
