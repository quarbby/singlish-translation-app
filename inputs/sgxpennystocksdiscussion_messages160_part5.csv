haha no. just aim aspen 260 first. if can break  dont be greedy. Take profits at some points aft 260.,btohqsg
For anyone interested in security guard furion's view on Moya. He written a great commentary for the counter.,btohqsg
moya asia. resting on both GMMA and fibo point. highlight is the OBV which despite the several selldown it shows net accumulation. assuming no breakdown the apex will be reached in less than 1 month time. unlikely to take so long but just a worst case estimate. numbers and analysis to follow,btohqsg
Need heegul shout then we enter,btohqsg
JY! All will be fine. placement shares at 0.238... share price will defintely be higher  no sentiments of vaccine here. Purely manipulation alr. This 5 days critical.,btohqsg
