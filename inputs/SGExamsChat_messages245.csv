Hey everyone!With COVID-19 measures reducing opportunities to interact with cohort mates in university (which matters a lot esp to incoming freshmen)  I‚Äôve launched uni-specific telegram bots that match you with another student to start a convo (these chats are anonymous and occurs within the bot which acts as the ‚Äúmiddle man‚Äù).Just head to your uni‚Äôs bot and type/start!(And you‚Äôll match with whoever types the/startcommand as well!)Chat can be ended with the/endcommand (and you can match with a new user again).Just head into your uni‚Äôs bot below!NUS:@nuschatbotNTU:@ntuchatbotSMU:@smuchatbotSUSS:@susschatbotSUTD and SIT:@SUTDxSITbotI‚Äôve merged both SUTD & SIT into a single bot for now (until userbase is large enough)‚Äîdo intro your school at the start of every convo tho!‚Äî-Haha as the bot‚Äôs in its infancy  there may be some waiting time until the user base gets big enough! Do share this with your friends!You can exchange contacts  but do make sure to be cautious and stay safe! The bot has a ‚Äòreport‚Äô feature and you can disable pics from being sent as well using the/nopicscommand! Feel free to contact me if there‚Äôs any abuse!There may be occasional glitches/maintenance periods but everything seems running well as of now! You can drop me your feedback too!I hope y‚Äôall find this helpful! :D,btohqsg
It will look smth like this!,btohqsg
My classmate from Sec 4 last year,btohqsg

Hi everyone in Upper Sec/JC/Poly/ITE/Uni! Mentee applications for the Advisory Mentorship Programme 2021 are OPEN! üåü‚úèÔ∏è With 2 000 students expressing interest for 700 mentee spots with our 560 volunteer mentors in 2020  the Advisory Mentorship Programme is returning bigger and better this year with 16 mentorship partners and over 900 mentors from a wide range of occupations and industries.üè´ Open to students aged 16 to 28  this is your opportunity to be matched with industry mentors from your field of interest on a one-to-one basis. The Advisory Mentorship Programme runs from June to September  and applications close on 11 June  2359h (GMT +8).Apply to be a mentee now at:mentorship.advisory.sgüëà‚ùì Want to figure out how it works? Hear from last year's mentees at an info session this Friday  June 4  8pm:https://bit.ly/3p3vEh6,btohqsg
üåû excited to see everyone‚Äôs mentee applications! I‚Äôm from Advisory so feel free to dm me if u you have any questions~,btohqsg
Tbh it's nice if the same concept could be applied to asking for advice about different majors  ie you could have different chat rooms for different majors in universities  people who want to contribute information would join and wait to get matched,btohqsg
Yep!! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be working towards to! Haha there was just a bit of a chicken and egg problem when launching (people will only use the bot if there are already users)  so I kept it uni-based first (so there‚Äôs a large enough pool for matching and waiting time isn‚Äôt too long)! If the traction keeps up and there‚Äôs a large enough user base  I‚Äôll work on the option to match based on major!,btohqsg
Hi  anyone in NUS BIZ sch? can PM me please!!,btohqsg

Like the process of solving those problems - no need the specific aspects.,btohqsg
Idk how to explain sia HAHA,btohqsg
I think tideman is quite advanced for an intro course,btohqsg
Reducing the problem to finding cycles in a graph and then implementing in an intro mod is wew,btohqsg
Stamford students be a different league,btohqsg
But eh got see william lin's video on his 1st sem in MIT,btohqsg
Man got an A- for algorithms course and he's IOI gold medallist......,btohqsg

tbf IOI qns don't relate to life either ahaha,btohqsg
Does it mean the A+ students can beat William in competitive programming,btohqsg
Hahah no la he got docked because his explanations weren't good enough so in a way cp was a disadvantage cause yknow you wanna be the most efficient as possible,btohqsg

hellu any nus cs senior able to give advice on ATAP?,btohqsg
I didn't go thru that route tho,btohqsg
looking at the pre-reqs of my mod  i might be only going ATAP in the last sem,btohqsg
which according to the web  i‚Äôll only be attending convo. the following year,btohqsg
I hope I tag the correct guy,btohqsg
@andrewomeif you don‚Äôt mind  can i dm!,btohqsg
Long long long long long long long long time yes,btohqsg
If not u can try asking in the sg codin Grp,btohqsg
Idk if I'm still in thr,btohqsg
but for your qn... atap will eat into special term so you should actually hit up the soc office instead cause i won't know what's their stance lol,btohqsg
they can always make special arrangements?,btohqsg
cause internship results take super long to come out  like i can finish my internship in aug and the results only come out in september,btohqsg
according to the atap webpage  sem2 ATAP will span to ST1  degree conferred on 31 aug  but i join the ceremony following year,btohqsg
idk if the ceremony part is an issue (?),btohqsg
you can not appear for it,btohqsg
i think the issue now is my prereqs is messed up :'),btohqsg
i wanted swe + security but 4239 has 2107 and 3235 as pre-reqs,btohqsg
if you can prove that it will affect graduation sch may allow you to skip prereqs and do them concurrently,btohqsg
frankly 3235 isn't that much more than 2107 lol,btohqsg
unless somehow or another 3235 and 4239 can be taken concurrently,btohqsg
Time to prove to them without cs double degree i cant graduate,btohqsg
i've seen ppl doing 3235 + other mods with 3235 as prereq tgt as well,btohqsg
oh wait no‚Ä¶. i can‚Äôt do it even with concurrent2107/3235,btohqsg
since 4239 is offered in sem1,btohqsg
mayhaps time to revise your plans then... lol,btohqsg
yeah seems like sec route is no go then,btohqsg
like just don't take a graduation requirement mod until you completed enough mods for a second degree,btohqsg
it's damn stupid but is that possible lmao,btohqsg
i don't think the school would complain,btohqsg
after all you're paying the fees,btohqsg
but whether or not they will confer you the 2nd degree is the question,btohqsg
actually yea thats the thing I was wondering,btohqsg
you have to go through the application process and get it approved,btohqsg
that's the bare minimum i suppose,btohqsg
I'm gonna have to delete this first  pls go through the offical channels if you wanna post a link,btohqsg
my friend got forced to graduate or take more 4k mods,btohqsg
uni will rush you to take whatever mods you are missing,btohqsg
you don't  graduate  but at what cost,btohqsg
unless you keep getting A for other modules and get F for the last one,btohqsg
since I think you need a certain cap to prevent getting kicked out of uni,btohqsg
Anyway I'm not saying to actually do itb,btohqsg
O actually got maximum candidature years,btohqsg
If you don't graduate within that time  you gonna get kicked out of uni,btohqsg
PhD also have  that's why it's super headache if boss doesn't let you publish,btohqsg
everyone grad from sec sch alr,btohqsg
Haha alevels part is also dead,btohqsg
should i send work emails now,btohqsg
or should i wait until tmr morning,btohqsg

Can u teach me how to python? I suck at it,btohqsg
Idk i can do c languages like okok i do python my brain like cannot process lidsat,btohqsg
Isn't it supposed to be the opp,btohqsg
C# is basically short cut for c++,btohqsg
Python is like writing pseudo code,btohqsg
You just aren't used to writing python lmao,btohqsg
Like there's a lot of useful stuff in Python,btohqsg
I thought Python has the easiest Syntax???,btohqsg
Tableau can count as programming language meh,btohqsg
Then which language has the easiest Syntax?,btohqsg
Uh python is relatively easier than c++ and c hahaha,btohqsg
Eh v useful for data science leh,btohqsg
For the grandscheme of things its useless,btohqsg
Even now php is getting back in data sci,btohqsg
Which is 1000x easier than python imo,btohqsg
Then how tf is python harder than c++ hahaha,btohqsg
Python is the second best language at everything,btohqsg
Just open google collab and u can code in python alrdy,btohqsg
do ppl now even still learn,btohqsg
Just code in ur native then convert it,btohqsg
There are too many programming languages,btohqsg
Time to create one universal one!,btohqsg
Then u can pick up the others,btohqsg
Java technically once u know c++ shouldnt be hard,btohqsg
Altho i still dont get it,btohqsg
Js still doesn't feel natural to me,btohqsg
Js literally branches out into a billion different subscripts hahaha,btohqsg
Gonna wait till CS1101S to force me to use it,btohqsg
If udk that u can say bye bye to a lot things alr,btohqsg
1st js2nd html3rd c++4th ruby5th python,btohqsg
If u consider html a language then ik where u stnd alr haha,btohqsg
I think we can all disgree with that list,btohqsg
U still dont get my point which furthe proves my point,btohqsg
No i am serious u go to most companies ull seldom see them using non excel/accessDB for data management unless its a software dev,btohqsg
Even there ull find people using it,btohqsg
Rather use python libraries or R to visualise,btohqsg
I shld just save it in my gallery at this point LOL,btohqsg
I was thinking of that actually,btohqsg
Lai can use matlab 4 dat,btohqsg
Even better convert the data into Arduino legible and connect it to legos for a more 3D representation of data,btohqsg
I only touched matlab for linear algebra,btohqsg
Actually its quite fun to use it for maths,btohqsg
If u have the time to create the matrices that is,btohqsg
any1 know wts is a kmap,btohqsg
my friend ask me if Ik and Im like isnt it a map w a letter k,btohqsg
I didn't get my desired output,btohqsg
it's an algorithm to get SOP of boolean inputs,btohqsg
that module was 3 years ago,btohqsg
Uh what else u wan them to use,btohqsg
frankly never needed to touch it ever again,btohqsg
How and where u wan him to represent the data,btohqsg
Idk I might back out of it,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not really interested in being vaccinated,btohqsg
I only chose Pfizer because my parents chose it,btohqsg
Got but not as much as the old batch,btohqsg
Most of the A level cohort here(that talks) graduated a while back,btohqsg
