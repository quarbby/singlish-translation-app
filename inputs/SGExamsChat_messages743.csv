i saying this cause last time some bodoh jam brake at speed camera  then chain collision  2 lanes blocked  my 30 min bus ride become 1.5h,btohqsg
"why the mi students never yell back ""lower cop""",btohqsg
quite ironic right. the thing that is meant to prevent accidents caused an accident itself,btohqsg
I mean it's actually a study that traffic scientists did regarding that and why most cams they fucking tell u with like 20 signboards,btohqsg
idk apparently driver somehow never get the message,btohqsg
Solution is to either increase the speed limit  or put a lot more speed cameras,btohqsg
Tbh I feel like some places the speed limit could be higher,btohqsg
hearsay last time around early 2000s  they did a trial on ecp  increased speed limit to 110 for 6 months. but then reverted back,btohqsg
regarding the more speed cameras part  they are actually doing smth about it soon,btohqsg
where do y find these syickers,btohqsg
what is tall  skinny and fragile in condition,btohqsg
stop w all tge stupid jokes ah,btohqsg
If u act do this coke will come out ur nose,btohqsg

ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€,btohqsg
ok i sent so much skull that it became text msg,btohqsg
Exactly la tbh I think u can understand also traffic flows is actually kinda cool as it conforms to some laws of flow and motion lol as a unit,btohqsg
Intro speeding motorcycle going 20-30km faster than rest of traffic,btohqsg
I also did a few readings on crowd control as well bruh lmao that's just thermodynamics,btohqsg
idk bro my iChat they never send,btohqsg

my dad drinks Red Bull everyday,btohqsg
Bruh my bus literally hit the largest pothole,btohqsg
Bro hr is as high as my ping,btohqsg
His blood pressure as high as my ping,btohqsg
Hmm. There are conflicting studies about whether changing the speed limits increases or reduces the frequency of accidents. One which said increasing it slightly wonâ€™t and it has something to do with psychology. If the speed limit is too low  people will tend to speed far over the limit because they think itâ€™s unreasonable. If itâ€™s too high  more prone to accidents since vehicles canâ€™t break. So I guess we need to find the sweet the spot. If they donâ€™t want to make the speed limit too high  no choice but to put speed enforcement cameras in a lot more places,btohqsg
I hope it actually works in reducing traffic accidents then,btohqsg
But I rly think some roads the speed limit could be upped by at least 10,btohqsg
so exhausted  thank goodness there's a long weekend,btohqsg
Last time our public buses can go up to 100mph,btohqsg
When the new buses car out in the 2000s  they added a limiter to all public buses. Limiting them to 60mph,btohqsg
I guess it rly depends on the roads. And also for red light cameras to be effective  rly need to put a lot. If not gonna have that kind of accident which Xavier described whereby drivers suddenly break in order to avoid getting caught by the cameras.,btohqsg
Yeah thatâ€™s why if you read my msg  I said itâ€™s about finding the sweet spot,btohqsg
Some roads Iâ€™m quite sure increasing by 10 more is perfectly fine,btohqsg
Now they are adding limiters to the lorry's and trucks you see,btohqsg
actually speed limits for certain roads and vehicles used to be lower,btohqsg
e.g. vans and small lorries used to be limited to 60  kpe used to be limited to 70  other expressways limited to 80,btohqsg
Speed limit are effectively more like speed suggestions,btohqsg
Often 80 is just effectively 85 on a highway because of flow if u strictly follow 80 that might be fine but depends on time of day whereby the flow can be a lot faster.,btohqsg
yes. if u follow speed limit on lane 1  especially during free-flow conditions  everyone will hate u lol,btohqsg
Yeah so depends lor gotta balance regulation and flow and the speed limit is just there as a suggestion and speed cameras even in normal operations leds to a deliberate slow down in flow for like 1km before and after the cam.,btohqsg
Which is intended cuz if u look at cam placements it's often on s curve high incline bends which legit is better if u slow down,btohqsg
as far as i know. the only vehicles left in sg without speed limiters are cop cars,btohqsg
this can go up to 150km/h i believe,btohqsg
without a limiter  this van would have outran that corolla in speed,btohqsg
Oh nice so they did actually increase some permanently,btohqsg
will b enough to net a C-B if you keep practising,btohqsg
What particularly are u struggling with,btohqsg
nothing I just want to secure A for my upcoming wa,btohqsg
I just scared i mess up my factor analysis for ss/dd shifts,btohqsg
More of reading the model answers as a guide to familiarise urself with the answering structure and to get a better understanding what is required for the qns,btohqsg
But need to make sure u understand the content first and bridge any gaps u may hv,btohqsg
U need to have good content basis first before u can go into the analysis part,btohqsg
Maybe try to break down the qns and do it step by step to avoid mistake,btohqsg
Itâ€™s true even if a student canâ€™t understand the Econs concepts very well  there usually would be enough standard qns such that brute force memorisation would be able to get a student at the very least a C,btohqsg
Some measure related to sus growth,btohqsg
this is based on what ive seen,btohqsg
Many of my EJ friends jumped from S/U in prelims to C/B for A Levels by just memorising answer keys,btohqsg
my friend still doesnt understand the difference between demand and quantity demanded,btohqsg
I rmbr you said sth like your schmates just memorise answer key after prelims then they got a for a levels,btohqsg
yeah this is the rarer few,btohqsg
A i would say still need to like,btohqsg
I just tell all those who ask me to think of it as demand as the whole curve whereas Qdd refers to a specifc price level,btohqsg
I wish NSFs can get time off for retaking As,btohqsg
If I actually retake Econs I rly donâ€™t wanna use my vacation leave,btohqsg
Also pls manage your time well. For essays  2 mins per mark. For csq (full 30 mark qn assuming you h2)  allocate about 10-15 mins for reading the extract  2-2.2 mins per mark for answering qns,btohqsg
itâ€™s only out of 16 :(,btohqsg
Are you a h2 Econs student?,btohqsg
yeah itâ€™s just bc itâ€™s wa,btohqsg
H1 has a little less time,btohqsg
Ah ok  so should only be csq,btohqsg
If itâ€™s your first then donâ€™t need to fret so much  the scope is usually very small,btohqsg
Idk go eat or maybe go for a walk,btohqsg
better stay home and sleep in,btohqsg
Actually eggs despite the high cholesterol,btohqsg
Got some study that shows ppl who eat them have a slightly longer life expectancy,btohqsg
I wanna eat tamago sushi now,btohqsg
So itâ€™s still every odd Thursday hbl?,btohqsg
Good thing ac didnâ€™t remove hbl,btohqsg
Some schs like sajc after covid they removed hbl day,btohqsg
I can finish up with my work after a hectic day of cca on wed,btohqsg
Nice so you got long weekend thanks to hbl and Good Friday,btohqsg
i found out someone from my cohort is in this gc,btohqsg
he got a B for a level econs,btohqsg
and he did the DD/SS microqn,btohqsg
maybe cause he smoked it v well?,btohqsg
cuz normally he gets 16/25 for the macro essay,btohqsg
Do u think it's borderline B,btohqsg
Anyway if the boy joins this gc and i suddenly go inactive,btohqsg
He never got more than a S back in EJ tho,btohqsg
Damn but a B despite not knowing that,btohqsg
he was so happy he got more than 20,btohqsg
yeah  I can finally get my beauty sleep,btohqsg

ok if there's pork inside then it sucks,btohqsg
i like it without the meat,btohqsg
as some vendors say its meat price,btohqsg
I feel like thereâ€™s no difference besides the size,btohqsg
I want to see how an ostrich egg tastes like,btohqsg
"FR getting scammed "" eh auntie I thought I oni buy 2 veggie 1 meat ? Why so ex """,btohqsg
BRO IF THERE'S PORK IN THE EGGS then is it considered meat alr ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
the vendors gonna start adding meat into the veggies alr,btohqsg
someone from my class is in this gc,btohqsg
Next one is in 2 years tho,btohqsg
nvm can go to njc carnival,btohqsg
Like the carnival is to raise money for the sch since Acjc is govt aided. Some of the funding they need to raise themselves,btohqsg
Wait actually what sch were you from tho if you donâ€™t mind saying,btohqsg
Up till now I still donâ€™t know,btohqsg
Yeah they need to raise as much money as possible,btohqsg
I mean can pm if you donâ€™t want say here,btohqsg
I think each funorama can raise like 500k,btohqsg
thats what acjc wants you to believe  but in reality the principal can buy a private jet for herself,btohqsg
