Your patience will pay off. Those chased yesterday one  today sure jialat.,btohqsg
aiya TA wkly📈 already so obvious.. if we didn't try at near 4¢.. we shall not chase high at upper range bound 6¢..If you really want to shaRe LC ATH now  at least tell the reason why..,btohqsg

I can tell it's extremely difficult to trade in n out unless you are really genius.,btohqsg
Ya 👍.. everyone had different comfortable ways to trade..Most like PA vol. to play intraday trade but some like try low & wait.. depend on individual trading habits.  but it's not a culture here,btohqsg
because you will TP with 2/3 pips. but  will continue to hold even if it drops 10 pips unless kena force sell.,btohqsg
depend on market participation  public shares available to trade and anticipation for news to get it to move  having FA and TA knowledge is added advantage  but overall you can`t beat insider information,btohqsg
