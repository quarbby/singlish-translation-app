Not the best FC because not hybrid but it is still pretty good,btohqsg
And where did you source the car,btohqsg
"Mazda 3 interior v nice (only for front pax)... the rear is a bit ""meh""",btohqsg
Mazda the FC bad but I think the driving experience is good,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ what car is that sia,btohqsg
Cannot base your experience on that ma'am,btohqsg
And it is the previous generation as well,btohqsg
And the Mazda 3s are PHV cars converted to GetGos  worst combo possible,btohqsg
What are you getting 6.8 on?,btohqsg
Bro its conti car üòÇüòÇ conti fc never good,btohqsg
Let's just say I got a fat right foot,btohqsg
But idt its thaaaat good either haha,btohqsg
U nvr organise ‚Ä¶ meet who sia,btohqsg
That one roll cage like race cars use,btohqsg
No need to re fuel  just keep racing ah,btohqsg
Yea‚Ä¶I know. Too one sided point of view,btohqsg
Do you drive in the city a lot?,btohqsg
Noted  XF can get 10km/l min. with city highway mix easily,btohqsg
Mixed  best I got was 7.2 or 3,btohqsg
You compare to Prius of course not good,btohqsg
Forgot to tell you before eek,btohqsg
My one FC is damn bad,btohqsg
Lmao and mine is supposedly the best fc amongst its peers,btohqsg
I eco pro all the way sia,btohqsg
Similar but mainly for convertibles so that your head is protected by maintaining distance between head and ground if you flip,btohqsg
I use leg cycle the car ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Tsk!! Where is the clutch then,btohqsg
Got a few  this the one my friend recco who has an XF also,btohqsg
Eco pro doesn't mean your FC will be better,btohqsg
Likely 6 to 8 km/l for a normal driver,btohqsg
Heavy foot like sirrick howmaybe 5 to 6 only,btohqsg
This one also good  many Bentley and Volvo peeps go there,btohqsg
My first tank only 5.8km/l but that was like fun drive,btohqsg
They actually have a clutch button on the wheel,btohqsg
Specs I think 65 but usually when I pump its 60l,btohqsg
Assuming you're referring to the 3.0 btw,btohqsg
Not the V8 or the 2.0,btohqsg
I tot the v8 is 5.0,btohqsg
That one heavy sia.  But ah.. supercharged ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è love it,btohqsg
Also the 2.0 and 3.0 roughly the same FC,btohqsg
Because 2.0 lesser power but still need to pull same weight one,btohqsg
But nvr know .Supercharged 0 lag ..,btohqsg
Yeah mine 2.0 but drink like water,btohqsg
It is supposed to  cus my throttle was limited  so u aint suppose to rev so high. But im blaming it on city driving nowadays üòÇüòÇ now my distance run quite short,btohqsg
Engine swaps aren't legal in Singapore,btohqsg
It is agreed  but if you're a heavy footer,btohqsg
You will see yourself rev higher in eco pro compared to comfort,btohqsg
I prefer to drive on sport,btohqsg
You try driving a bit more chill,btohqsg
