Alot of the mechs in sg are malaysians,btohqsg

Wa. Speaking of servicing  how often do you guys change fuel filter ?,btohqsg
Is it a routine job or can go like 100k km change once that kind ?,btohqsg
LOL. My mechanic say 100k km then change. But google say 2 years or 40k.,btohqsg
Same i also 100k need change,btohqsg
Im more of a preventive maintenance guy lol,btohqsg
when i don't know when something is changed  i just changed,btohqsg
but i never thought of fuel filter before lol,btohqsg
This one i heard if pump jb petrol best to do it ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
jb i pump only vpower racing or ron100,btohqsg
I youtube on changing of fuel filter. Like not an easy job. need to remove the filter at the fuel reservoir there.,btohqsg
So i dont know if the mechanic thinks its a hassle or simply because dont need to chang,btohqsg
i shall consult my panel of experts on this question,btohqsg
your tank all need to down,btohqsg
Let me know what are their opinions :D,btohqsg
yeah loh. So not exactly a straight forward job like oil filter.,btohqsg
"1st answer was ""Yes change if plan to mod""",btohqsg
LOLOLOL. Changing of rims also mod leh. hahaha,btohqsg
2nd answer - if dirty/clogged then need to change if not  no need,btohqsg
This one to see also must remove no?,btohqsg
From what i understand is normally got problems then change,btohqsg
but if you want to do preventive,btohqsg
can just change when you feel like it lor,btohqsg
Either that  or like what@roincecmentioned  when it has issues. But you wont know it has issues until it happens. lol. Which sometimes may be a bit too late,btohqsg
"my friend answer best ""U will know if u know  if you don't know means not clogged""",btohqsg
i used to wait till almost empty then pump  now about 1/3 i pump already,btohqsg
so the fuel pump don't need to work so hard,btohqsg
Hais i am left with 50+km now need go home later from seletarðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Prob go pump first then go,btohqsg
Oooo. Too low fuel will stress the pump Ah? I normally pump whenever left with 1/4. I go lower than that one tank before my servicing and pour Techron in together,btohqsg
Because the tank more empty need to work harder to push.,btohqsg
Yes. Best to pump when is half tank,btohqsg
Lai lai leh long leh long,btohqsg
