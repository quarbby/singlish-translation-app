Does anyone have any tips on how to juggle time between these 5grps: old aged parents  aunties&uncles (1 whom suffered stroke; im the main caregiver for all)  young children  spouse and in laws  with a 9am-6pm office job (no maids) and all elderly living across sg (not tgther)? I'm starting to feel extremely burn out - living the life of a sandwich class in an ageing society,btohqsg
It would be good to have a village of people to support you. Very tough to do it alone. Might your spouse or relatives be able to help out? Have you considered a helper?,btohqsg
Yes  my spouse helped out. But I felt I neglected him as a result. All relatives are elderly who need help themselves. Had a helper for stroke care but sent her away after a few months because of some issues which gave me more headache than helping me,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not easy to juggle so many tasks. I‚Äôm proud of you for holding on for so long and reaching out to us. üòäI‚Äôm wondering if your aged parents  uncle  and aunts are known to any community partners. It might be helpful for them if they need assistance  which could take some of the load off you. You could consider approaching the medical social worker (if they have medical appointments at a government hospital) or the activity aging center in the neighbourhood or Agency for Integrated Care for advice.,btohqsg
Thank you for your advice‚ù§Ô∏è only my aunt is known to aic a few years back due to stroke. Don't think she's in the file by now. Nope for the rest of the relatives  they're quite private ppl  and don't want to trouble others. But that's a good suggestion! I'll try to call in aic to see if any help is available,btohqsg
I get that elderly can be quite guarded against ppl who they don‚Äôt know but I think things will get better after they know the community partners long enough and rapport is built. They are prolly in a better position to refer the needful services too if they need help in future. But most importantly is to self care before you can care for others üòä jiayous! üí™üèª,btohqsg
"It's hard when you're playing defense - there's more of them than there are of you. And with elderly  likely that the workload/needs will go up over time  gradually or suddenly due to events.For your parents at least  are you able to discuss with them the long-term plan such as downsizing to a place near you? They might not be keen to move out of their own area  but you have to be honest about your capacity to them as well. Always easier to move at a ""younger age"" so they have more time to adjust",btohqsg
Hi Pauline  I am a young caregiver of 2 who is looking after family members who requires special attentions such as being dementia and delusional disorder mixed dementia. I understand the struggle as I am both studying in the night while working full time in the day. My bf and I usually take turns towards the caregiving process but we ended up with conflicts too because of the folks.Can try to ask AIC for grants and helps ( quite significant) can ask them for help for meals on wheels ( subjected to means testing) it is not some atas meals but at same time balanced diet ( volunteers send the food up to their home and peak on them if they are staying alone or if you are not available to cook or pack food for them )   Can try to contact MET for appointments  COMIT if needed for caregiver related counselling ( FOC but need to make known to AIC first )If you need respite care or additional help can try homage/ Active GLobal .These are tips which helped me previously because my folks are highly guarded. I did manage to send one of them to daycare too and he is so happy these days. Hope this is helpful ya,btohqsg
Likewise   i do not have the whole village to support. Is definitely tough as I struggled very much over the years but I am happy to share with you these available help which i had learnt over the years.,btohqsg
Hi Pauline  It sounds like you're balancing a lot right now  and it's completely understandable to feel burned out.To help alleviate some of the load  I‚Äôd like to introduce two services that could provide some relief through AIC referral: Home Personal Care and Respite Services.Home Personal Care Services:This service provides caregivers who come directly to your home to assist with daily activities such as personal hygiene  feeding  medication reminders  and mobility support for elderly family members. Trained professionals handle these tasks  so you can have peace of mind knowing your loved ones are in good hands while you're at work. Home personal care can be tailored to your family's specific needs  offering flexible options that can accommodate both short-term and long-term care.Respite Services:If you're feeling overwhelmed  respite services can be a lifesaver. This service allows the primary caregiver to take a break while professionals step in to provide care. Whether it's a few hours or several days  this support ensures that your loved ones receive high-quality care while you recharge.Both services are provided by qualified healthcare professionals  ensuring that your loved ones are well taken care of. They can also be accessed through community service providers  and depending on your situation  you may be entitled to subsidies through AIC referrals based on means testing.These services are designed to lighten your load  giving you the time to focus on other responsibilities without compromising the care your family members need.Take care of yourself  Pauline ‚Äì you're doing an incredible job.,btohqsg
You may also want to consider:Home Nursing Services:If your family members require more specialized medical care  Home Nursing Services provide professional nurses who can assist with wound care  injections  monitoring of vital signs  and managing chronic conditions like diabetes or post-stroke care or to apply for any financial assistance schemes or mobility finding that could off load your consumable burdens. This service is ideal for those who are bed bound  ensuring your loved ones receive high-quality medical care at home.Meals on Wheels:To help with nutrition and meal planning  Meals on Wheels delivers nutritious  well-balanced meals directly to your loved ones' homes. This service is especially helpful for elderly family members who may have difficulty preparing meals on their own  ensuring they receive proper nourishment without the need for you to be physically present.,btohqsg
