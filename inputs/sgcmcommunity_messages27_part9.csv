Largest cultish followers. E36 is not successful,btohqsg
Which 4 banger engine is better? Older M10 Fuel injected engine or the newer M40? Out of budget for inline 6,btohqsg
No. The old engine is a workhorse. The key thing to remember is to replace the timing belts at the right interval or early.,btohqsg
Yea this is more important than anything else for old cars.,btohqsg
I can revv and revv that engine to 6200 in 4th gear. And still okay. In fact superb. Pistons crown clean,btohqsg
Same with most well engineered old engines back in the 70/80s  Newer engines can't tahan that load for long.,btohqsg
It really is a daily driver engine. This is a strong  rugged  engine,btohqsg
Just as I needed like the VW air cooled engine.,btohqsg
The more I trash hard then better the engine becomes. No kidding.  It I use good engine oils. Only synthetic 0w40,btohqsg
And then the fuel economy becomes even better after hard driving,btohqsg
Only 4th can do 6200. 5th can’t. Overdrive gear,btohqsg
Yes correct. Port fuel injection. Drag the engine to 6200 in 3th. Or 4th. 185 kmh,btohqsg
Yes. That’s why I asked you to get e30. Very easy to maintain. And parts are cheap too. Don’t get e36,btohqsg
After trashing hard the engine I get about 11 km a liter,btohqsg
I always thought E36 had a better IRS setup as compared to E30 Swing exle,btohqsg
Any engine cc la. It is a workhorse,btohqsg
And it feels just like the m3. Due to its balance. And eat it anchors deceleration braking. All same. Just noisy. Very noisy. I think very basic noise insulation.,btohqsg
https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1081189&DL=1000I just dont understand the price. 🥲,btohqsg
Since you like old car I feel this is suitable for you. You can swap in our many components. The rear diff ratios also,btohqsg
Actually .. in-line 6 is the better mechanically balanced one,btohqsg
I know Jason Cammisa is enjoying his bored out 2.7L 325i Touring.,btohqsg
No. Not true at all. My friend swapped a online 6 on his e30. He asked me to test it. It’s heavier front.,btohqsg
But still overall maintains the bmw handling. He swapped the m3 front suspension. It’s voila. Corners on rail. Superb,btohqsg
Any engine is in fact good. But a strong powerful 4 is best. Look at the m3. S14 4-cylinder,btohqsg
Psst: I still prefer Mercedes Benz 190E 2.3/2.5 Cosworth over Beemer M3 🙈,btohqsg
Still 6 cylinder is great. Although it’s a bit heavier in front it’s still superb. He placed a m52b25 engine in. Crazy guy,btohqsg
hahaha later mata come to ur door good thing u say malaysia 😙,btohqsg
Wrong Inline 6 la. The period correct inline 6 is M20,btohqsg
Last time people do that. Caught.,btohqsg
M20 is 12 valves. And low tech.,btohqsg
The BMW engine maintenance is also just regular oil change and timing belt (timing chain?) change and thats it right?,btohqsg
Mercedes trounced by m3. The saloon race car started by Mercedes. But unseated by m3,btohqsg
Replace worn gaskets  coolant pump also need,btohqsg
Old car maintenance be sure you keep a journal. A lot of things to do. And keep track of what to do and what’s due.,btohqsg
Today e30 is very sought after and desired. It is a nice daily driver. Low running cost because parts are not expensive. But the body parts are hard to find. Even scrap yards don’t have anymore. That’s for you to consider,btohqsg
That is one difference from VW beetle. For VW  it is still possible rebuild the whole thing new with OEM or remanufactured parts  so long you are willing to spend $$$,btohqsg
Timing belts be sure keep track. I busted it twice. And repaired in BvO cost me 1800$,btohqsg
What is the old Beemer recommended workshop in SG?,btohqsg
I will need to do my maths.,btohqsg

The other headache is rusts. Most headache,btohqsg
I do the oil change myself,btohqsg
Like fish tank water pump? 😂,btohqsg
Last time I drive to Thailand. Now I dare not die to rust,btohqsg
I bought oil sucker from jalan besar hardware shop long long ago and it becomes handy.,btohqsg
Big container can store 6 liters,btohqsg
Yes do it once for allParts. I changed to new radiator twice since 2004. Radiator is $160 and I changed this myself. This one is quite easy job,btohqsg
I actually dont like BMW LOL(the newer model),btohqsg
I absolutely hated the signal stork. No wonder Beemer drivers dulan dont even signal liao,btohqsg
Yeah the new models suck. I don’t like either. I won’t buy. They look boring all same,btohqsg
