there will be many times where u feel like there's so much to do but not enough time,btohqsg
V rare in jc  at least in my jc,btohqsg
there will be times where you will be doubting and wondering why you chose JC,btohqsg
rare as in no time management and motivation?,btohqsg
Like not alot of ppl display self motivation ah,btohqsg
I feel self motivation comes frm knowing what u want to do,btohqsg
jun wei ditch bio or physics,btohqsg
words from my past students who chose bcme instead or pcme,btohqsg
h2 maths has quite a fair bit of links with h2 physics I think,btohqsg
i never say I going jc..... ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™,btohqsg
idk why but everyone jc experiences is like a hit or miss...,btohqsg
My sis got her results also,btohqsg
plus points for not seeing bedok,btohqsg
aiya js study tgt cn edi,btohqsg
idk any business thing can suck my non existent cock,btohqsg
Haha. u will slowly get conditioned,btohqsg
oh ya where that mf go,btohqsg
was thinking who are you LMAO,btohqsg
doesnt really matter to me HAHAHA,btohqsg
nah u should have seen the Joel episode where he pretends to be a girl,btohqsg
actuakky this gc all talk cock one ah,btohqsg
she did so much better than she needed to,btohqsg
YAH BRO SRS SRS SIYAN MY MENTOR,btohqsg
she was worried she canâ€™t even nett 10,btohqsg
oh the fuck I didn't know,btohqsg
like I CLD go jc too but it's too far ðŸ’€,btohqsg
u legit dl ur sch ah,btohqsg
i'm taking h2 geography later this year ðŸ’€,btohqsg
20 years after I graduated from JC  econs is the most useful,btohqsg
I actually didnâ€™t know u cld do this with telegram till this lol,btohqsg
means easy but need more than 1 step,btohqsg
Better to go to jc over MI,btohqsg
Three years feels too long for A levels,btohqsg
Year 1 is just idling around tbh,btohqsg
eh honestly.. what's the pt of going MI? is it a levels,btohqsg
I thinki spend more time sleeping in class,btohqsg
dont want to go to poly because need to do internship etc lol,btohqsg
i feel like i only stopped sleeping in classes in y4 of uni sia,btohqsg
ok I got the point now,btohqsg
bruh that internship is so much more useful than you think,btohqsg
main point of poly is to supply lower-skilled workers than to feed them into uni,btohqsg
Hmm i can get the same experience as a Uni student bah haha,btohqsg
I tot ppl want that ðŸ’€,btohqsg
looking for that first intern as a uni student with a resume that has nothingâ€¦,btohqsg
ok then.. let's say I can only go yi or mi.. wld you rather I go yi  than to go poly?,btohqsg
tbh if anything stuff like internships is a reason i might have chosen poly had i taken o levels,btohqsg
more and more people also realising that a poly diploma isnâ€™t enough,btohqsg
if you want career growth eventually need the uni degree,btohqsg
I guess that's the appeal of MI over poly haha,btohqsg
i feel like the shift is esp these few years,btohqsg
