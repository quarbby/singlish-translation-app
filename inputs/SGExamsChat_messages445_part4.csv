Ngl I kinda wonder if any of my classmates will end up thr sia,btohqsg
75% of my class want JC la,btohqsg
Cuz the so called JC Vs poly poll was,btohqsg
I think like half my class went hci/ri/nyjc,btohqsg
Idk la but we all q quiet,btohqsg
I see alot of my classmates come back sch,btohqsg
Not end of the world if u fuck up,btohqsg
And despite what ppl always say it does impact ur future q alot,btohqsg
Arguably more consequential than pri tbh,btohqsg
Kinda dumb seeing yall all 16 yr old dumb fcks being forced into ur futures alr,btohqsg
But ig its the world we live in,btohqsg
i mean i was light headed but its fun,btohqsg
Ngl if I get into poly,btohqsg
If I can't go tm maybe poly btt,btohqsg
U need find the right course lor,btohqsg
But idk if I rly want,btohqsg
Also u lock in poly course means u cant rly choose liao,btohqsg
U wan end up like siyan isit,btohqsg
If u good u end up like siyan,btohqsg
Can go academia and be well respected,btohqsg
Not much pay but hv social prestige,btohqsg
If I end up hating chem,btohqsg
people dont choose econs...it is econs choose people,btohqsg
nah it aint bad but...have a taste of it in jc and decide ah haha. I rather do math than econs any day,btohqsg
Preferably am going the screw bio route,btohqsg
econs is really like a relationship...yall either click or dont click  that's it,btohqsg
I got look at some econs vid before,btohqsg
it makes a lot of sense in theory  but the rage comes when you do the papers haha. But uni econs is different so...i cannot say much,btohqsg
i will never forget econs for life. I will forget small details but those big concepts i will never forget,btohqsg
Got once my friends wanted to eat KFC at tamp hub then we found out McDonalds replace KFC already and we were like ''horizontal acquisition'',btohqsg
but tbf i hear people complain about chem more than econs,btohqsg
imo in JC chem i didnt find it memorisation heavy? Other than organic rxn,btohqsg
Some of the qns make me wanna jump off the building,btohqsg
but then after enough practice  it became intuition  like 1 look already know what reaction,btohqsg
Like those rly long winded data kind,btohqsg
I just rmb it made alot of sense,btohqsg
i got a whastapp sticker for that,btohqsg
bro suffered for no reason haha,btohqsg
