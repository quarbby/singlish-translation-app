Can I check insurance payment  what card can I use?,btohqsg

Hi Gurus  may I check Prudential company has discontinued hard copy Giro application form ady. For HSBC EGA If register thru Prudential website is it excluded from Giro 1% cashback?,btohqsg
I just clock the premium to card that have ega giro setup,btohqsg

Hi  anyone knows if we can buy/sell shares from our CDP account using CMC invest?,btohqsg
Hmm so it doesn’t counted as self initiated right🫣 I seem confused with the T&C,btohqsg
It's only self initiated if you use the bank in-built GIRO billing. eGIRO is still going through the billing organisation.,btohqsg
I see…thx Guru for clarifying 🫡. Will try it out and share it if success hehe,btohqsg
Only credit card bill can be giro leh. Debit is directly deduct from your own bank balance. Where got giro,btohqsg
what credit cards offer good mpd/cashback for general spending mobile contactless payments? only know of Citi Rewards (w Amaze)  UOB EVOL. don't really spend much on dining/shopping so HSBC Live+ not useful for me 😢,btohqsg
I feel after all the latest nerfs  cashback cards are not as good as before 🥲.,btohqsg
2 principles of max-ing credit card benefits1) make hay while the sun shine2) adjust and adapt,btohqsg
both cashback and miles getting nerfed left and right,btohqsg
Oops. Yeah it's the amaze card. Just wondering is it strictly online or tapping is ok too. I read somewhere the mode of payment matters too,btohqsg
The amaze card you can do whatever. Tap  swipe  contactless  online etc.,btohqsg
Amaze card I always tap on it.After I cross over 160k kris miles. To me miles doesn't matter much anymore . Transport I use hsbc t travel 1 card to tap even though only 1 miles earn.,btohqsg
So you converting to team cashback? Since you say miles don't matter anymore,btohqsg
No... just not so much focus 100% anymore.  85% enough,btohqsg
Expenses will continue to use citi pay all and card up to earn miles.Esp . Insurance .Sp bills,btohqsg
15% just concentrate more on 1 miles card...Such as hsbc 1 travel and Amex platinum charge card.,btohqsg
So 100% focus on miles? 🤣 Your math ain't mathing,btohqsg
Is still on miles .Just that can afford to use transport on 1 miles card instead of 4 miles,btohqsg
Hi Chris and any UOB credit card strategists. Good morning! I am starting to implement the UOB quad cards (Solitare for Dining+Family  Krisflyer for travel  Prvimiles for Cardup and One card for utility bills  watsons and shopee) + OCBC365 (for patrol)  to replace all my other cards. But I realise I didn't have a 4mpd card to catch all for general retail in-store shopping such as fashion  popular book store  shoes  electronics....Which of my 5 cards is best for retail in store spending? Or really must i add on the amaze+crmc strategy? I tot I can terminate my maybank Horizon  HSBC Advance and citi premiermiles Mastercard...,btohqsg
What about UOB ppv for in store transactions?,btohqsg
Only 1.4 mpd. Was hoping to optimise with 4mpd since retail spending is not small amount for example buy a facial treatment package..,btohqsg
UOB preferred platinum visa my dear,btohqsg
General retail . You can try ocbc rewards card.I use it for watson   guardian  uniqolo   bata  retail shops. 6 miles awarded until dec,btohqsg
If you can spend above 1k  then uob visa signature (min spend 1k),btohqsg
Hmm.... I go study.... but means additional card. So really my current quad card is not yet optimising...,btohqsg
Ain't you asking for a 5th card anyway?,btohqsg
But one card already has minimum spending criteria.,btohqsg
Kris flyer uob. Is a strong card for transport   travel and dining.  Will get the 3 miles. You will get it unless you can guarantee to fly Sq 800 $ in 1 year.,btohqsg
I tot I maybe missed some 4mpd feature among one of the 4 cards. Ha...,btohqsg
Can I check the maybank platinum visa quarter is counted in calender month?,btohqsg
