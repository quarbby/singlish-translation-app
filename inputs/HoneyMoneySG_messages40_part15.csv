Can also see which cards giving good sign-up bonuses,btohqsg
Agree is a good opportunity to tap on sign up bonuses of different credit cards. DBS Altitude is one  if you are eligible can also try DBS Vantage sign up bonus.,btohqsg
There are also some jewelry shops on Kris+. Perhaps can pay with different credit cards and split the transaction to maximize rewards,btohqsg
If your spouse was intending to repay their half of monthly HDB loan using 100% CPF (since they hit FRS in SA already) would that influence your decision to use cash or Cpf for the remaining half?,btohqsg
I thought only SK sia.. but shouldn't decide where to go based on rewards alone bahBut ya if can split between multiple cards  split it ;D,btohqsg
Which would be the better SC account to open? I just registered the no min spend SmartSC bonus thing  but I've yet to open an account. Don't really see myself using SC much  just wanna open one to get the cash bonus. Cheers!,btohqsg

If having too many credit cards  (although paying all on time and in full) will that really effect credit score? Will that effect future bank loans ?,btohqsg
i dont understand this too  i have one and pay on time also give trash score,btohqsg
It’s very hard to understand  because they won’t really tell you upfront. Have you ever took any loans ?,btohqsg

Anyone has any idea how to setup giro on HSBC EGA for tax payments?,btohqsg
Can request from filling up the form. But i filled up the form since first week of march and no news till now. Intending to go down to branch,btohqsg
If apply too many credit card in short period of time also affect score. Maybe because of that.,btohqsg

Think will improve over times if pay on time.,btohqsg
So this basically means bank won’t give me loan ?,btohqsg
Trust or youtrip got better rates?,btohqsg
Usually Trust  depends on currency exchange rates. Suggest you try both cards on small transactions  and share here. Cheers.,btohqsg
Banks will always take into account your credit rating when considering your loan eligibility. So it's always better to refrain from applying for too many credit cards when you are expecting to take a large loan or re-finance in the near term. Some even go to the extents of clearing any outstanding CC (even if they are not yet due) prior to loan application.,btohqsg
Hi all  the DBS Women's World card can be used overseas to get 4mpd?,btohqsg

Hi experts  firstly thanks for all the advice.Generally does jewellery shops like SK and Tiffany & Co allow splitting of payments into different months?Was thinking to go down and pay on multiple months to maximise the cashback/miles haha,btohqsg

You can actually raise a support  ask for a callback and they will send a acc opening form to fill up  then offer a remote zoom session to perform identity verification,btohqsg
