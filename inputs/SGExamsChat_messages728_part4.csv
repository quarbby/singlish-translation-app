i like to torture myselfi like econs,btohqsg
no need. pi and fyp clear eee side can liao,btohqsg
thinking how to electrocute peoplei like eee,btohqsg
Bruh u got a slide with your curriculum structure? Also your STARS courseload is like what 24?,btohqsg
i tried accessing it just now but for some reason now suddenly cannot access when i alr accessed it like 10 times for the past 8 months lol,btohqsg
Ah no wonder 5 years la.. if u overload by 4 can rite?,btohqsg
ntu force u min 4.5 years lol,btohqsg
plus eee acad office very reluctant to overload ppl lol,btohqsg
Idk if it's strictly enforced tho tbh,btohqsg
I mean if u clear everything liao what they gonna do,btohqsg
Make u sit there eat snake isit,btohqsg
this sem managed to persuade the office to let me overload literally one day after close of add/drop period and this is after more than a month of continuous appealing and rejecting lol,btohqsg
U need to send in form one rite?,btohqsg
with fch gpas for both in sem 1 somemore,btohqsg
I just went to my office and then get to know em can liao,btohqsg
lol add/drop period i visited the acad office at least 3 times lol,btohqsg
I visited it 5 times 1 during STARs wars the rest before add drop,btohqsg
i probably submitted the form twice  wrote in to them via email at least 5 times also lol,btohqsg
For admin actually rite they got the power to allow u to overload your maximum load + 6 AUs,btohqsg
If u wanna go above that u would have to get approval from your head,btohqsg
yeah but even admin themselves can exercise their own discretion mah,btohqsg
u give them the power doesn‚Äôt mean if student appeal they must do,btohqsg
Ya lor so u gotta personally buddy the admin,btohqsg
how. every day buy them bubble tea ah lol üòÇ,btohqsg
Not rlly la.. basically keep your word and work within the rules and restrictions,btohqsg
Oh and always tell them everything. I mean everything related to academics and what u intend to do,btohqsg
yeah so i did tell the admin if i dont overload this sem  next sem engineering math 1 and econometrics 1 the finals may clash  then these mods is a prereq to a lot of mods in either eee and econs lol. somemore econometrics 1 only offered in sem 1. so i tell them to allow me to take 1 more mod over the max so that i dont have to wait until y3 to take econometrics and basically everything else lol,btohqsg
O nvm ur name says IP,btohqsg
then only after that the appeal went thru haha,btohqsg
Wow that's a lot of reasons... I got my overload request approved by saying I just like the Prof and am familiar with his teaching style.,btohqsg
yeah eee office hard to persuade lol. i was queuing behind someone. the ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù want to change index to accommodate part time work. the admin ask that someone to show proof of his meeting with client lol,btohqsg
Eh? Mutual swop need reason one meh?,btohqsg
ehh i mean change index not swap index sorry lol,btohqsg
cause other indexes full liao so he trying to appeal,btohqsg
Oh chey. Ah that one is based on availability so it legit is not even in the admins hand,btohqsg
actually i think admin still can squeeze in people even tho stars system shows full,btohqsg
They can but even so certain indexes are legit just full,btohqsg
plus tbh i think eee very easy to squeeze lol. most mods no class part. half the ppl dont bother to attend tutorials lol,btohqsg
Yes u even have to specify the course.,btohqsg
I tried to get a clash wavier last semester,btohqsg
Didn't work and it was the dumbest reason ever,btohqsg
Dunman high ah like stated in ur user,btohqsg
Cause u also in rp chat so confused,btohqsg
yeah that‚Äôs why i wanted to overload one particular mod if not next sem the mod‚Äôs finals will clash with another mod  and both mods are also prereq to like a lot of things. also have to wait one entire year lol,btohqsg
Doesn't matter to the admin those are still students and the cap is reached.,btohqsg
Clash wavier are like damn hard to get cuz u need to liase with both ProfIt's just too much shit,btohqsg
true. i manage to slot into engineering math 1 literally one day after close of add/drop period and they slot me into fri tutorial cause that‚Äôs the only index with space available. i just go attend a tues class cause no class part plus free up my thu and fri lol. and when i went to tues class more than half the seats are empty ü§£,btohqsg
Bro so I tried to get a clash wavier as the lecture for one mod is prerecorded + there isn't even a lecture at that time. The videos are alr recorded and just release at that time,btohqsg
That mf said cannot cuz exams and tests will be scheduled at that time... like midterm and end term test,btohqsg
Anyone want to be spammed with cat pics in dms,btohqsg
