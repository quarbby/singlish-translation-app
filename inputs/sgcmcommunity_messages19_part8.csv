Morning All. Just need some advice here  to buy 2nd hand parf car  which year's car is more recommended? Thanks,btohqsg
I think more like two years for me sir,btohqsg
Good morning sir  even for wine I can’t answer that question. You might need to be more specific on brand  model or some general guideline for the community here sir.,btohqsg
I reckon 20k with installation here,btohqsg
And not meant for track so you need a spare iron for track days 🤣,btohqsg
"Hmm...usually it's ""which brand of car is recommended?"".You are different. 😁😁",btohqsg
You don't need need iron discs for track days  ceramics can handle the temps better on track for sure. But they recommend iron brakes because they'll degrade slower which means they'll last you for a few more track days than the ceramics and cheaper to replace,btohqsg
Just some A-B car like Honda Vezel (HR-V) or Shuttle.,btohqsg
These are a good choice but tough be sure to do the homework to not get a masked phv and tweaked mileage...,btohqsg
Byd cheaper depreciation around 11 k compare to vezel and save on petrol and bigger,btohqsg
BYD Seal With 517 HP And 650 KM Range For 43 000 USD Launched In Chinahttps://carnewschina.com/2022/05/20/byd-seal-with-517-hp-and-650-km-range-for-43000-usd-launched-in-china/,btohqsg

Japan cars got a lot to catch up,btohqsg
Not convinient to charge still right  for EV car,btohqsg
For me Is not hard at all   the benefit is way better,btohqsg
Most of the driver 1 week charge twice   if don’t have dedicated charger or not driving tesla   nowadays got alot of work place   shopping center got charger facility or even petrol kiosk   can just plan 1 week twice to do some errand and charge the car,btohqsg
I checked those 2019 car  the markup is so high though their COE is low.,btohqsg
Ya since this year hehe   cause new car price very high,btohqsg
That why buying like byd save a lot of money as the arf is very low due to ev subsidy compare to ice,btohqsg
Need twice a week? I dun drive but the mileage for a full charge like byd e6 is how long,btohqsg
40 minutes Depent on your state of charge and the charger speed   40 mins is base on dc like 100 kw,btohqsg
