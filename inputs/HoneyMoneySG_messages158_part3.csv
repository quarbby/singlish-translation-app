Usually based on their closing time. Some dp states that some 24/7 outlet post next day. Nothing is black and white  just based on dps shared here.,btohqsg
icic thanks haha i just saw ystd that i am a little short and ystd was too busy. spent a little extra in case those that are not posted yet dont get posted but just did the calculations ok lah if those pending dont get posted the $20 still enough to cover,btohqsg
sory what is dp and dps?,btohqsg
Guys  I got this message trying to set up my amex pay. Any idea why ?,btohqsg
You just got your card? Need to wait for about 5 working days  I faced the same issue.Aft 5 working days then try again  if still like that then just delete and reinstall the app  then shd be able to go through alr,btohqsg
Hope you used card directly  not mobile wallet (eg Samsung pay),btohqsg
Card directly posts faster (I did that before on last day  worked),btohqsg
Got some dp that say it will post faster. But in my experience I never had to use physical cards  my Samsung pay transactions for same-day merchants (non-24/7 outlets) always post same-day.,btohqsg
oh damn didnt know  too used to just using mobile wallet to pay,btohqsg
I always use mobile contactless  so don't worry. You have 1 day buffer anyway.,btohqsg
Anyone knows when does the bonus 9x uni$ for the preferred rewards category for UOB lady be credited?,btohqsg
First working day of next month,btohqsg
Is this the section to monitor to see if I will get the SAVE bonus from OCBC 360?,btohqsg
"Yes. But you need to take note when it was ""last updated"" if you want to make adjustments.The safer option is to self track on excel.The safest option is to not touch the money after depositing $500 and transferring out salary.",btohqsg
has anyone tested mcc and didnt get charged 50 cents using amaze?,btohqsg
I tested on 10 Mar  no 50 cents charge.,btohqsg
note: i think UOB KF 1 8x miles multipler kicks in 1 year after ur sign up date i think,btohqsg
because its annually that they check whether u spent $800 on SQ or SCOOT,btohqsg
This was taken from UOB Prvi webpage. (https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/travel/prvi-miles-card.page)Is it true that UOB Prvi card can no longer earn ipaymy since Aug 2022?,btohqsg
Hi guys  with CF saga i intend to move my money somewhere. I already have UOB and OCBC and would like to have something similar like CF with flexibility and good interest rate. Can kindly advice? Thanks a lot,btohqsg
Sing investment and finance 2.5% GoSavers saving account...,btohqsg
ya one of the one that i m looking at  just curious if there is any other option,btohqsg
oh what is this? is it fixed or flexible saving?,btohqsg
Does OCBC usually give better sign up offers than this?,btohqsg
Ocbc is usually stingy so this is pretty good already,btohqsg
Ah understood  if currently am only a sub card holder. Still counts as new user right?,btohqsg
You already had saving accounts so what about SSB and tbills?,btohqsg
Yes still considered as new to ocbc credit card. Only principal card holder counts.,btohqsg
the reason is im trying to put the money in uob and ocbc unmoved in order to count the MAB easier  thus need a flexible one like CF for daily expense that have a lot of money movements with small amounts,btohqsg
same day returns if i rmb correctly.. returns only hi2% at the moment..,btohqsg
hi2% meaning 2%? isn't maribank slightly higher? or typo?,btohqsg
Ok for an account for daily expenses id suggest digital bank. Maribank saving account is decent. Don't treat cf like a bank please.,btohqsg
ic  ya 2.9% looks not bad  is it quite instant withdrawal? or need 24hours?,btohqsg
quite instant  same day as least,btohqsg
haha ya  been there done that  learnt my lesson... ya so far it seems maribank is more attractive to me for high movement in out savings account,btohqsg
hsbc has it as well but thats CASH fund not LIQUIDITY fund,btohqsg
only moomoo n webull got liquidity fund i think,btohqsg
got it  fund in moomoo is safe hor? like maribank has sdic is safe haha,btohqsg
Moomoo is not bank  I would say similar to CF.,btohqsg
ok got it  then i think i go for maribank for small fund <5000 a month and high in-out transactions... thank u all so much for the advice,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if there is 30% U.S. dividend withholding tax for the interest earned from treasury notes/bonds bought on platforms like tiger? How about buying TLT on IBKR?,btohqsg
Maribank dropping to 2.38% from 1 April onwards FYI. But probably still among the higher one for sdic insurred.,btohqsg
ya saw it from the website  that is also why im asking for advice here in case of any other option... i checked GXS also quite low,btohqsg
oh! let me check this up,btohqsg
At 5k  it's 4 dollars difference/month between 2.38% and 3.3%. Order 1 meat instead of 2 for 2 meals can already.,btohqsg
ya eat more vegetable healthier choice~,btohqsg
Is there a point to open up a uob one accountwhen I already have ocbc 360 account plus ocbc 365 ccAnd have a uob ladies card,btohqsg
how does it work? any site for reference?,btohqsg
Any good bond fund or mmf that is low risk  similar to Fullerton cash fund?Wanna park some money at a safer investment tool...,btohqsg
Its in the tnc so not sure what else you are looking for,btohqsg
