Anyone have any experience going into sentosa for deliveries using motorcycle? Is it true you‚Äôre not allowed to enter?,btohqsg
I was rejected once by the guard and had to call the customer from the hotel to walk out and collect the food. My mistake was to leave the food at the guest services hut near the sentosa gantry. Got a call from the customer saying the food went missing! My brain cannot function already cause it was almost midnight already. In my mind  if i heck care  sure lalamove penalise me because i didnt personally handover the food. So just to let the matter rest  i refunded the customer the whole food bill. I know it was stupid but at that time lalamove CS was not available and customer like never give chance. If yall were in my shoes  how would yall handle the issue better?,btohqsg
For all residential side can motorcyclist are allowed to enter and deliver. For hotels  only those hotels in RWS are allowed. The only hotel that we're allowed to deliver which is not part of RWS is W hotel. Other than that  for capella hotel  outpost and all that motorcyclist not allowed.,btohqsg
