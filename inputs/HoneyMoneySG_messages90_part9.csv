apply for monthly instalment on iras website,btohqsg

Hi James  right now  you cannot use your credit card paywave to pay for hawker food.  XNAP provides a way for you to pay using XNAP that links to your googlepay(android)  applepay(iPhone).,btohqsg
noted. I seldom use scan to pay. Only try out iChange recently but failed. It could be that it cannot recognised the qr code like google pay. Will try out xnap to see if it helps.,btohqsg
installed xnap and it only support my Google pay. No setting for other payment method.,btohqsg
what giro arrangement u on now?,btohqsg
think need to check with iras cso how to resolve the issue,btohqsg
Yours can be see on iras website?,btohqsg
Could be because the tax year is about to end/start so you can't create new instalment plan,btohqsg

Hello! Anyone knows if I can pair the Citi rewards + amaze card to earn miles on travel expenses egbooking.com  agoda etc?,btohqsg
Nope  Amaze or not it's still travel MCC which is excluded,btohqsg
Ahh I see ok :-( thank u!!,btohqsg
Anyone has any recommendations on which cards to use instead for travel expenses?,btohqsg
Try UOB Lady (ideally solitaire with travel category selected) and WWMC. If paying in FCY  can consider UOB VS as well.,btohqsg
Can anyone gives me some good reasons why you take miles card over Cashback card ?? I'm a Cashback card user and by using multiple cards I can achieve up to 10% cash back in $2k spending every month.,btohqsg
Oh thank you that why it not reflected when i use paynow with ref SALA,btohqsg
For international online purchase e.g. disneyland in JPY  will my CC be charged addtional FCY charges?,btohqsg
You are doing great with cashback cards  keep it up!,btohqsg
Because u should use miles cards to cover the categories that doesn‚Äôt give u 10% Cashback.,btohqsg
Sounds to me like you're trying to brag more than looking for a proper discussion  but I'll take the bait üòÇCan you still get 10% cash back if you need to spend much more than $2k a month?,btohqsg
Nothing magical for 10% cashback!Uob one gives 10% cashback for $1500 of $2000 spending on specified merchants like dairy farm and grab.,btohqsg
Hey did u pay online with Citi Rewards in the end and get your 4mpd?,btohqsg
SCB Bonus saver needs salary credit  how about their e$aver? 3.6% also good without lock in (though short period)?,btohqsg
So is miles card gives miles to all spend? No limit of category?,btohqsg
$600 gojek with dbs yuu (18%)$900 Maybank fnf (8%)$500 Citi smrt (5%)It's about 10% Cashback,btohqsg
A bit more maybe can . But it too much more definitely get lower Cashback and also depends on what category. This is why I'm considering miles card if it doesn't limit any category spend,btohqsg
