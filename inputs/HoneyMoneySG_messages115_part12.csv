"Reported as two seperate trips. VISA does report as two transactions (so two ""SimplyGO"" records for the same date)",btohqsg
As long verified against SimplyGo app it's fine. On the same day if you make 2 separate trips on the same card  it's still considered 1 transaction.,btohqsg
It consolidated to 2 trips. Which is correct üëçüèª,btohqsg
Ya if your consolidate means like that hahaha.,btohqsg
Yup if it's not consolidated it will be 4 trips with missing exits. So good news we know they actually take the virtual card number into consideration.,btohqsg
Ah.. ya ya is consolidate. They treat as unique trip,btohqsg
Technically 1 card can share across family,btohqsg
Can add to family member phones right?,btohqsg
Quick check expertsFor utilities such as SP bills and telco like singtel/starhub/m1CRMC linked with amaze can earn 4mpd ?,btohqsg
Is there any other cards that gives high mpd?,btohqsg
Quick check on the Citi Rewards + Amaze card  let‚Äôs say if I make a purchase overseas with the the Citi Rewards card via Amaze  there are no foreign transaction fees and I will only get charged for the item I buy (converted to SGD)? Will this transaction be eligible for the 4mpd too?,btohqsg
No foreign transaction fee  but amaze spread is about 2%.Will get 4mpd if you aren't paying for travel/mobile wallets.,btohqsg
Yup. As the mobile wallets will generate a new virtual card number every time.,btohqsg
citibank cards exclude utilities  telco ok,btohqsg
Hi have questions  if I set my Citi rewards to pay for Telco such as Simba(auto payment) does it qualify for 10x points?,btohqsg
I remember it needed to be manual payment. If recurring cannot. I think ah. I forgot. I usually go down to singtel and pay using amaze,btohqsg
Never use amaze card overseas if a refund is possible...I paid my hotel and applied a refund on same day  but paid $560 got only $551. An exchange rate was applied.,btohqsg
different exchange rate between paying and refundingü•≤,btohqsg
Not sure abt others but singtel kiosk mcc is 5999. So amaze+crcm works,btohqsg
That will apply for all card. But do note do not use amaze card for hotel security deposit hold. Always use other bank cc,btohqsg
You mean I can never get a full refund as long as I paid overseas?Is there any ways to avoid it?,btohqsg
You may get more. It always depend on the exchange rate on the time of the refund.,btohqsg
If u choose to pay in foreign currency it will always be suject to currency change  buy/sell rate always have a spread,btohqsg
There is 2 exchange rate I think? One is for buying  another is for selling. Selling rate is always lower than buying rate  so if I pay and refund on same day  I will always get lower refund  right?,btohqsg
Yes correct even for same day,btohqsg
99.9% of the time is lower. But if you lucky enough for the fx spread to go crazy and work in your favour then congrats,btohqsg
"It depends on how the transaction is processed. If the transaction has not been settled for that day and merchant does a void  then the transaction is ""deleted"" (as though nothing took place)",btohqsg
That's I want to sayüòÇAmaze card is processed too quick  that cannot be canceled,btohqsg
UOB card always use 2~3 Days. I'm not sure if it related to merchants,btohqsg
Hsbc revo card useless already right üò¢,btohqsg
You should  there are a lot of options available üëçüèª just check against your spending needs,btohqsg
Isit wise to convert all hsbc points then cancel ?,btohqsg
Well. What is ur other option? Don't see use then cancel bah,btohqsg
Okay  so meaning can use CRMC directly on telcoDont need go through amaze  correct?,btohqsg
I think it also depends on how you pay also.I think there‚Äôs some data point referring that you need to key in the credit card details manually to trigger as a online payment in the appI think u can do a search  should have some answers ard,btohqsg
I have a question at the back of my mind pls if you‚Äôll can help answer. You see  many people are so disgruntled about the funds in RA (for Standard Plan) going into the pool; interest and all.But I understand that interest earned till 65 or until a member start draw down is our money from where we draw monthly payout correct?The interest that goes to the pool is only interest earned when we start our CPF LIFE correct. Wonder if anyone will be able to calculate how much interest will go to the pool taking an example of someone in Standard plan with FRS example.I think most people are not very clear on that. I also. Thanks,btohqsg
Most of the private clinic in general is 8099. From what I know. Hope it helps,btohqsg
No options yet. Planning to get another similar 4mpd,btohqsg
RA is RA  CPF LIFE is CPF LIFE. There's no Standard Plan in RA but you can opt to choose Standard Plan for CPF LIFE when you opt to start payouts.If you are automatically enrolled into CPF LIFE  you can opt to start payouts from ages from 65 to 70. When you opt to start payouts  you can choose one of the 3 plans available. Choosing Standard Plan (by default once reach 70) will result in 100% of your RA consumed for CPF LIFE.Interests earned with RA will be returned to RA while interests earned with CPF LIFE will go into CPF LIFE pool.All of the above info can be found onCPF website.P.S. there's no real benefits to take any plans outside of Standard Plan or after 65.,btohqsg

Hi all  I have question: if I move out all my OCBC 360 fund to HSBC on 18th June  does it means I don‚Äôt qualifies for this June interest (increment $500 daily + salary bonus) or interest is pro-rated?Tq,btohqsg
Unless in May your OCBC 360 is empty  unlikely you will qualify Save bonus. Why would you move out mid month anyway?,btohqsg
Heymax vouchers  shopee/lazada  atome  grab. Very limited basically.,btohqsg
Hi guys  for ocbc 360 account to be eligible for the salary portion to get interest can we just paynow to the ocbc account indicating SALARY / SALA / SAL?,btohqsg
Hi  may i know if there is any cap for amuse card for oversea spending? As from what i understand   using in sg  there is fee charge over 1k.,btohqsg
