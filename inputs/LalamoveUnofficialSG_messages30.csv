When no driver llm will wake up,btohqsg
Once u press settled fees  then no priority le.. Coz the merchant cannot press on Their end.. U leave it  continue ur next job  then u will see x amount has been paid by merchant,btohqsg
Don't know leh... we just ignore and walk off,btohqsg
Honestly the orders are fine. Like wtv la fare abit low. But the worst is we got no CS support,btohqsg
Llm wanna cancel they threaten us w suspension,btohqsg
Lol... I this week only do 2 days.. No mood.. See fees sian le,btohqsg
Customer sometimes play punk we also must tahan,btohqsg
Friday do 12 jobs. 10 cars.. Only 164 gross,btohqsg
Stay home watch money heist.. Lol,btohqsg
So in short the priority fee will auto go in to us ?,btohqsg
Only if u don't press the settle fees when u finish the job,btohqsg
The back room lady says the merchant will have to click the priority payment if they want to book another job.. If not they cant,btohqsg
I tried one where I click settle and another where I did not,btohqsg
The one I click settle  I did not receive any payment on priority.. The other one will inform that they pay.,btohqsg
"U are suppose to call the merchant to inform u have delivered and ask them to click the priority fee payment.. ""suppose""",btohqsg
Thankscharm! Will take note on this,btohqsg
Haha i used to say the same thing abt Grab last time  until everyone seriously suspected i was a Grab Spy. It's not a matter of loyalty... I jus think that while we can be unhappy with some things  there's no need to take it to the level of thinking that the companies take pleasure in torturing drivers. There are many reasons behind every move they make  and in fact a lot of it is to cater to feedback given by drivers.,btohqsg
Eg. Many van drivers may think it is unfair that they are now blocked from bike jobs - but maybe lalamove did that cos many van drivers also complained it was hard to scroll  messy  car and van jobs hard to spot  affect their income  lalamove inconsiderate  times are hard  why make things even harder  etc etc etc etc etc....,btohqsg
"Similarly there are many reasons behind why they designed the new app this way... their ""solutions"" may be flawed  but no company sits in their office thinking of how to make life miserable for others. Only terrorists do that.",btohqsg
So this guy has simply chosen to focus his thoughts on being grateful that he still has a chance to earn income  instead of  eg. constantly believing that the companies and govt have a conspiracy against us  or feeling lousy why lalamove dont know exactly what we want,btohqsg
Neh...terrorist is liddatWith intention to make life difficult for merchantü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
No.... I think a lot by nature üòå,btohqsg
All these thoughts already have when driving Grab last timeIts also not purposely go think  it looks like a lot in words  but its simply how i see things and my reactions to whats happening ard me,btohqsg
Wow... thats like a lot of work. Same for the tips too?,btohqsg
And a lot of merchant don't know that priority fee now is put as tip,btohqsg
That merchant came out to me and says we are not going to give u tips.. When they put 2 dollars priority fees.,btohqsg
Tried explaining to him that's what lalamove,btohqsg
But he called lalamove to say that I insisted they give me tips,btohqsg
And refuse to leave with the delivery,btohqsg
From what's being conveyed to me from the lalamove back room lady,btohqsg
It seems this app is world wide launch.  The llm peeps inside also dunno anything and they  like us  are facing the wrath of the merchants  while trying to figure what's what in the app,btohqsg
I did notice the new interface for users now indicates if u have made full payment for a jobSo it will reflect in user app also right  that they have to pay the tips?,btohqsg
Meaning the llm peeps in sg are also powerless in the fares deciding,btohqsg
Yup.. That's where the settle fees come in..,btohqsg
If they put priority fees  we cannot settle the fees on our end,btohqsg
They have to settle first before us,btohqsg
If not priority = no priority,btohqsg
I wasted a 8 bucks priority on my first new llm app from pan pacific.. I just click settle fees without knowing,btohqsg
Kk...and i think they cant process that payment until job complete - thats where we press the settle bill button at the end,btohqsg
Sounds silly. Think for me will just focus on without priority or tips that are payable by customer first.,btohqsg
At least wa cow state it upfront,btohqsg
So now it's all called priority fees right,btohqsg
CbAfter the job is completedCustomer don't pay how,btohqsg
Priority fees are still taxable by lalamove right? As in they also draw 16% from it?,btohqsg
That's what I think too.. If its from corporate client  they have to click settle  if not they will be stuck with ordersIf its hdm dwellers... Jialat... They can don't pay  coz they don't need another delivery..,btohqsg
But it's not calculated to our daily earnings.. In the statistic,btohqsg
YeahJus thinking if customer dont pay  but llm still titi deduct comms from our wallet....gg,btohqsg
This new app increase petrol usage by about 20% if u want to hit the amount u make in the old app,btohqsg
More time needed to hit old app,btohqsg
0.32 taxes per 2 dollars tip lor,btohqsg
But the extra amt u make need to pay for that 20% extra petrol...... Lol,btohqsg
Ya.. So cannot gauge like last time.. Must full tank go out if u want work full day.. Last time still can 3/4,btohqsg
10 trips last time during weenend.. Maybe about 175 to 200..,btohqsg
I go apply work in their office sua,btohqsg
This new app can actually make someone get fired one.,btohqsg
I think it may work in other countries where dispursement of jobs is more concentrated  and fees may be too expensive there.And the apps are more geared towards those other countries.. Before its rolled out to singapore,btohqsg
FP n GF only citizen or PR can apply or?,btohqsg
If its your daily bread  üçû then in my words is lppl. Accept and Work... if its passive income then can walk away and look for another passive income  no life death threat versus if its your only job to feed the family,btohqsg
Life is short  be good to yourself üòä,btohqsg
True.... after doing llm I learn to accept life us such,btohqsg
issit me or the filter function in the new app is gone?,btohqsg
End of delivery  don't click the settle bill. Call customer to tell them complete. And ask them to click completer on their side,btohqsg
Then the 8 bucks will be credited to u if they pay by credit..,btohqsg
If we never swipe to complete...we still can continue to take on other jobs?,btohqsg
I collect $180   lucky I have not move out ? Need collect total $190 then deduct $21   the rest only transfer out   wa lao so leceh,btohqsg
Lucky manage to collect from customer another $10,btohqsg
Call is just to remind them rightAs in they can also complete payment without us calling?,btohqsg
Restaurant where got time remember who is who when u call,btohqsg
Ya.. But we cannot swipe settle bill.. Coz I think once settle they cannot pay the priority le,btohqsg
Maybe llm will take it as we collect cash,btohqsg
Ya probably the option to pay on their end will be gone,btohqsg
They jus deduct comms only  whether u really get the money or not your taiji lol,btohqsg
"Just to confirm ahU talking abt the black button that says ""confirm settle bill""  which appears after we swipe ""unloading complete"" and end job right?",btohqsg
Yan u want this black button,btohqsg
I had two jobs today where I was told that my order has been picked up by another driver -.-,btohqsg
Restaurant called say i picked someone else's order.. but its my order on app and showed them proof,btohqsg
I suspect bug in app  same order assigned to 2 riders,btohqsg
Subsequently llm called to confirm that I picked up and that's it,btohqsg
"Please be careful  extra aware of this kopitam/""restaurant.I took a multiple drop order from this merchant and they do not indicate their receipents address or contacts. When I call them  they did not pick up their calls. After calling them for at least 10x then they call back.Take their order at your own risk as it was time consuming to locate the merchant and receipents.",btohqsg
I agree. This is the only restaurant I ever have a problem. I was given the wrong address by them and had a merry-go-round. They called me like crazy and gave me an unfavourable rating. I complain against them n checked with CS who told me no one else has any complain against this restaurant?! CS oso wont do anythning for the rating citing there is no remark for their rating.,btohqsg
It should be on the receipts,btohqsg
Risky to do Royal briyanj and Royal Indian after 2.30am,btohqsg
Their orders maybe be 1plus am.. They are just forcing the order to be delivered without consideration that their customers may be sleeping by time its delivered,btohqsg
Recently briyani like to squeeze in 3rd location some more,btohqsg
I ganna once under heavy rain on eve of new year...The only saving grace for that day is one of the orders  the young girl who came down to receive order  wore nothing under her almost transparent white shirtüòè,btohqsg
Aye massive jam to clement ave4,btohqsg
Anyone use lalamove as a replacement for grab hitch? üòÇ,btohqsg
Grab bitch your pax can come and find your car  llm need to worry about parking for cars üòÇ,btohqsg
Unlike us motorbike we park anywhere,btohqsg
Found full time job liao  want to find ways to cover my parking,btohqsg
Just avoid town area and you should be fine,btohqsg
Or can ask some of the bros and sis here for parking tips,btohqsg
Haha best case is pickup near my office  and send home üòÇ,btohqsg
Normally all info will be at the receipt  they will write down the recipient contact number as well.,btohqsg
Is best to hv the address on the apps so as driver like me can see properly rather than the small print on the receipt.Is a time consuming  to locate the print,btohqsg
Grabhitch still best based on what you mention,btohqsg
Unless just nice got a job near by your office for pick up,btohqsg
If its the first time usually i‚Äôll tell them politely to include all details the next time.Customers dont know the difficulties we face. when delivering to condos (esp orchard area) where the guards want all their details like unit number etc,btohqsg
Honestly most of them are ok  some just cant gv a fk.,btohqsg
Why replace when u can stack or hitch to the location to pick up delivery?,btohqsg
Alamak. I forget to withdraw yesterday. If I submit now  when I receive $$ ah? Next Monday ah?,btohqsg
Hi anyone brought up the issue of drop in fares to the lala cust svc? Any response from them so far?,btohqsg
So many la-la driver spotted haha,btohqsg
Who is doing food panda here?,btohqsg
Main reason llm drop price ?,btohqsg
So hard to get a job within 2km nowadays,btohqsg
LLM part time  FP also Part time,btohqsg
If never drop price maybe dont see any jobs at all,btohqsg
Think too many complain no jobs..,btohqsg
Probably lalamove is on a supply demand kind of matrix.. More jobs = lesser price and vice versa,btohqsg
are the earnings really very good?,btohqsg
U have to see where ur location ma,btohqsg
Ur tier is wat level n price per trip ma,btohqsg
Average 5 order per 2 hrs  each order from 4++ - 6++ dollar,btohqsg
I think maybe its the other way roundLower price = more jobs = more overall profit,btohqsg
This i agree thoIm seeing many town jobs with priority fee  where got no job? Look like drivers not taking jobs leh lol,btohqsg
Even I think hitch also better then llm,btohqsg
Need university pple then know how to use llm,btohqsg
Town jobs really quite good i have to admit. But for car owners  its a headache,btohqsg
Any tips to take car job in town? Car park where,btohqsg
Actually i wanted to get a car to do delivery lol any bro and sis here driving can advise? Is it really bo hua?,btohqsg

Just attended the LLM training app update. They are aware of the rates   filters and also notes issues. Apparently they are working on it to rectify as they are aware,btohqsg
The rates they going to compensate?,btohqsg
Suddently so mqny order with surge,btohqsg
Not sure. Apperantly they know that rates dropped and could be due to the Google mapping. He said management is looking into this matter . Be patient lol,btohqsg
At least they looking into it.. Better than they ignore,btohqsg
At least they say they look into it.,btohqsg
Not been doing llm as rates sucks don't waste time,btohqsg
Apparently now must call restaurant before heading down. If restaurant didn't answer have to ask cso to unassign ü§£ like this can don't do tai cheong @ HV since they don't answer phone one,btohqsg
Cso told me have to call,btohqsg
Call when it is a parcel pick up. For food I don't think need to call,btohqsg
Restaurant not open and number listed there no answer. No compensation also,btohqsg
Shld just pick up and cfm drop off üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Hi im new to llm.. anyone got the link to the training video?,btohqsg

Becuase i tot it was different.. the youtube woman voice  i rmmbr the training was a man voice,btohqsg
How many hours do u guys drive a day?,btohqsg
All along from last time actually supposed to call  and they will maintain that and tell u only that becos if anything happen its the only way u have an argument against customer,btohqsg
And they can only tell u if restaurant dont pick up ask cso cancel becos they cant tell u if dont pick up just go and see wat happens ü§£,btohqsg
Next time don't go lol. Wait for restaurant or lala to call then go,btohqsg
Now been more than 7 business days since I cash out but still no news,btohqsg
Do you guy call customer to pick up n send items?,btohqsg
Seems abit troublesome for food items,btohqsg
Since some of them are credit orders,btohqsg
Downloaded this lalamove helper... omg auto took jobs once you put your criteria,btohqsg
Was trying and took like 5jobs within my citeria,btohqsg
Can dont call  but if item too big/send mia and you wanna call cso they wont compensate,btohqsg
My first few orders i call. But if pick up job while riding how to call sia lol i dont have handsfree,btohqsg
If you have dispute  they will ask you to send proof that you called. Screenshot call log. If don‚Äôt have  gg.,btohqsg
If user cancel means the driver or the client cancel?,btohqsg
So if I active auto grab job. Like this no time go toilet liao,btohqsg
Unless u not price sensitive and also able to drive around then useful,btohqsg
I tried omg took so many job which I don't want,btohqsg
So in the end how many job u took,btohqsg
Yes need to know how to manage it,btohqsg
I want to know too ....anyone try before ?,btohqsg
Actually  I think the New Lalamove is difficult to use ..... not user friendly,btohqsg
Yes u rightFor riders n driver is dangerous compare to the old apps,btohqsg
Thx a lot !!!https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.gaugau.sg&utm_source=TG&utm_campaign=Install&utm_medium=Social&_branch_match_id=767284185044771781This is our app  you may download and try it  please feel free to find us if you have any problems or want to give any feedbacks  it would be much appreciated!,btohqsg

LLM shb not allow this by giving customer rights to add last minute once driver  rider acceptes the job.Its take 2 hands to clap  tt it. If one accept a mutli location task then is ok  if not  tt isn't fair..,btohqsg
LLM is already such a cheapo value service  still need to be played or fool by customer üò°  wtf....,btohqsg
No more rider first now customer first üò¨,btohqsg

hey guys need some advice..I have been doing lala full time almost 1 month already..Can I know for car drivers  what is a good expected income?Per day I can make around $200. (slow days maybe $10-$20 lesser)1 month is around $4k. (Mon-Fri)Petrol $20/day. ($400/mth)Rental $1 120$4k-$400-$1 120= $2 480 nett income.Is this very little?,btohqsg
Waste time is one thingLast time jus start llmMy bad ratings all from stacked jobs lol,btohqsg
Now all trip lesser dont waste time,btohqsg
Then dun drive do macdonald better,btohqsg
Llm only good for fri sat n sunday,btohqsg
All app is gd if u r hardworking,btohqsg
Rental van betterMany sourcesNow car also cannot go in Malaysia,btohqsg
Pple will not put food on ur table remember,btohqsg
Like that all app is no good for me,btohqsg
oh what do you mean many sources?,btohqsg
Does that mean nobody really does lala full time driving car?,btohqsg
I don't qualify for PDVL thats why doing lala,btohqsg
Theres more van orders on lala than car?,btohqsg
Thanks for the answer ya guys cause family man need to try to do better üòÇ,btohqsg
What u're earning now on lala is as good as it gets for car,btohqsg
Van can take jobs from more categories - car  mpv  van x 2,btohqsg
But u probably need a helper for van la,btohqsg
Can register fp gfAsk helper go take food,btohqsg
I always see husband wife team   or mother son team on llm during pick up,btohqsg
Not keen on MPV jobs anymore... spend more time loading and unloading  easily can do another job.,btohqsg
Llm is fare higherBut earn more lesserLike bike 10+ Multiple job,btohqsg
If $250 per day is more worth it since u are renting.,btohqsg
I think if you have bike license  do gf better haha cuz daily guaranteed $200+ on weekends before incentive,btohqsg
Seems like really bad idea to do lala full time with car üòÇ,btohqsg
Use ebike do fpAlso earn more,btohqsg
But stuck in Chinatown for some time due to Chinatown jam,btohqsg
Good idea  get many many helpers  so can pick up more food  then huat ah!,btohqsg
Got van can do cluster parcel delivery,btohqsg
Point A collect  ====> Cluster B deliveryBurn less petrol  less parking  more walking  more planning,btohqsg
On the way home can pickup 1 or 2 LLM  completes 1 day,btohqsg
Reach client place unit number wrong  call them unreachable . I left to complete other jobs on hand. Then client callback ask me send back the food at a later timing. Tell Cs return trip n mileage need to amend. He say is my fault on the spot never Livechat them lolz,btohqsg
I call restaurant they also say call customer never pick up,btohqsg
As if livechat them on the spot can solve . If waited all the jpbs behind all become late haha,btohqsg
I know what u mean. Same thing with waiting fees,btohqsg
Peak hours find CS waiitng time 10-20mins ,btohqsg
And if they cant the client i jus wait there meh? Hahah,btohqsg
Just now this CSO also trying to find fault to not give me cancellation fee,btohqsg

Then my next order how to click?,btohqsg
Ask them to fix their stupid app,btohqsg
I go out come in livechat Q agaain,btohqsg
Once in Live chat cannot exit to other app,btohqsg
They shd just have anothet app which is Livechat CS,btohqsg
All of us drivers they want us type,btohqsg
Busy timing stop car just to type with CS,btohqsg
They best at finding fault and never understand their partners,btohqsg
The CS team sucks big time.... some are really rude.,btohqsg
My understanding is make sure you screen shot name and conversation if wanna shoot the CS with the management,btohqsg
I was advised by another  CS,btohqsg
They dont know how the ground operation just anyhow bomb us,btohqsg
Next time can just hang at door  or place somewhere outside if possibleAfter that take pic and whatsapp to customer,btohqsg
Usually as long as you properly inform and place properly somewhere (instead of eg. Jus dump at doorstep)  customers are ok one,btohqsg
Once i kena condo customer no response  i cant go up cos no one press intercomI left the food on top of letterboxes  write on bag for which unit  take pic whatsapp to customer,btohqsg
Since we know cs not reliable  cannot depend on them to solve anything,btohqsg
No bro dont even have the unit number given. App shows 09-101. In the end is 17-06 very big diff,btohqsg
Hi guys. Is this worth it to go? Kena 12 demerits alr.,btohqsg
