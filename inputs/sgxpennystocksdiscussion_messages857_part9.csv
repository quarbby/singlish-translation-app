🎉Pika World Alternative Market View – 9 Nov 2023🚀We have the solid rebound that everyone is yearning for. The Santa Claus rally appears on the horizon  and traders are busked in a flood of optimism.A week of weak economic data on the labour front seemed to have changed the tide  with investors pricing in an interest rate cut sooner than the Fed expected.I continue to hold considerable positions  although a pare down from an uncomfortably high level  it is worthwhile to hear from the bears of their argument. In this episode  let us review the 3 key reasons why Rosenberg Research isn’t trusting the current rally.In the research  the three broad reasons are :🎯Third-quarter earnings are sound  but the guidance indicates a cloudy future. The fourth quarter earnings estimate per share has fallen by around 4%  and this is prevalent across 8 out of the 11 sectors.🎯The current market rally results from a short covering of the intense shorted stocks  which often have weak balance sheets  or some called ” non-profitable” technology. This is a mirror of a rally driven by technicals rather than fundamentals and thus requires us to be more cautious.🚀A durable market rally often requires breath in the upswing for most sectors  particularly the small caps. However  Russell 2000  which comprises the small-cap stocks  isn’t participating in this rally. While the index has risen 4.3% in monthly return  they are still registering a negative return of 1.6% for the year.As the research pointed out  the gap in the return between Russell 2000 and Nasdaq is 32%  the largest seen in 2.5 decades  last seen in the progress towards the Dot-Com bubble.It is interesting to note that Rosenberg has a reputation for being in the bear camp  but the Wednesday release does pull investors back to the cautious optimism camp.It is Thursday  November 9  at 8.40 am in Singapore and 8.40 pm in New York. We wish all friends a profitable trading day ahead.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
