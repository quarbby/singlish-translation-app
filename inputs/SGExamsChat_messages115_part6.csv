The first batch did much better than RI,btohqsg
i think you mean those people are your allies  not your 'friends'  they are people you socialise with and share a common goal with  not actually 'friends',btohqsg
hahah the first batch are legends,btohqsg
Maybe first batch is the outlier,btohqsg
our batch legit gonna ruin it all just saying,btohqsg
if so easily call ppl friends then im a fucking social butterfly alr,btohqsg
Grades arenâ€™t the only thing that defines a skool,btohqsg
no shade but... our teacher compared our year by year grades,btohqsg
If a swimming pool defines acjc  ok,btohqsg
Everyone knows about ACJC because of you and your smiley,btohqsg
yup  I wish grades didn't define us,btohqsg
And ACJC is a subset of ACS,btohqsg
But we arenâ€™t actually that good at it,btohqsg
Grades don't define us  they just close certain doors,btohqsg
In fact our sports isnâ€™t really all that gret,btohqsg
We get distinction every SYF for every performing arts but one,btohqsg
And those certain doors ultimately are places that can potentially shape who we are,btohqsg
Tbh I'm here to rant about performing arts and entertainment industry again HAHA,btohqsg
The good thing is that they are doors; they can be opened (with luck and attitude),btohqsg
You literally cannot starve to death in Singapore  so as long as you persevere  you can make something out of life.,btohqsg
You can't magically have time squeezed out,btohqsg
my parents business making over 10k loss a month cuz of covid,btohqsg
Mm you most definitely can but we do have measures in place to help people should they want to take it,btohqsg
A lot of times you have stubborn people who don't want to take gov/social service agencies' support,btohqsg
wow so people's failure is their own fault,btohqsg
I've been working on a pilot project  starting up a kind of small community that promotes filmmaking and drama/theatre... my goal is to brighten the creator culture in SG. I invite aspiring local artists  actors and anyone else who is serious about pursuing the arts to join a networking telegram group where there's a lot of collaboration opportunities and also discussion on artistic/dramatic techniques,btohqsg
Yes  sometimes people fail because of their own faults,btohqsg
Like those cardboard sellers  I used to volunteer to visit and chat with elderly folks and there are so many instances of them refusing our help,btohqsg
Hope it goes well  the filmmaking scene in Singapore seems more like propaganda on how to be a better citizen to me lol,btohqsg
yup  that's what i want to change,btohqsg
Instead of those propaganda mills  how about actual films that keep our brain cells intact,btohqsg
At least it doesnt require commitment cause why on Earth would u want to watch that,btohqsg
Anyway if y'all are interested you can dm me anytime,btohqsg
@tinygreenstoneThat's an incredibly ambitious project  all the best to you,btohqsg
We're about two weeks old and already 25 members  all highly motivated arts career people who I know will go far  because the energy in that group is amazing,btohqsg
Yeah so if you put effort into finding time  you will find a lot of it,btohqsg
You know this is repeated only because it is true  right? Not that itactuallymeans more than anything that is required to be true,btohqsg
It's also repeated because it emphasises the system of meritocracy which we uphold and cherish in Singapore...,btohqsg
Credits to the person who set that question,btohqsg
A good propaganda mill actually keeps your brain intact,btohqsg
Oh that's quite cool  when did you start this project?,btohqsg
I've been planning and working on something like that for months  but I finally got things started for real 2 weeks ago,btohqsg
"Ah yes the 10k-years-old strategy of ""the weak should fear the strong""",btohqsg
Clearly not here to use this group productively,btohqsg
how is tinder such a terrible app,btohqsg
people below your league hit up on you and expect you to serve them like they're royalty,btohqsg
Guys can I still change my appeal course for nus?,btohqsg
i create a girl profile with a 10/10 girl with perfect looks,btohqsg
People who are in ivy league do not even need tinder but got many suitors from social media and irlðŸ˜š,btohqsg
proof that tinder guys are entitled af,btohqsg
