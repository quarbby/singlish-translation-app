You are talking to the right person üòÇ,btohqsg
How's the rate... I have a driver account but lately just lazy to go drive around.. I tot use bicycle or walk to do the walker,btohqsg
It's difficult if you never plan your route,btohqsg
Cos the walker account need to pay deposit first b4 I can see the jobs prices,btohqsg
All I can say in experience is plan..,btohqsg
I usually do from $12 to $20 jobs,btohqsg
Which require taking bus or mrt,btohqsg
Planning it's okay cos I use to do it with the car account... Just that this time round wanna try other mode üòÇ,btohqsg
Ooo like how far the distance,btohqsg
Okok then that's still okay lar..,btohqsg
Ya but car and moto rate diff.. so if want do walker abit different,btohqsg
If really gonna do walking it's gonna take a very long durations,btohqsg
I'm thinking to use bicycle üòÇ at the same time can exercise a bit,btohqsg
I from 10am do until 8pm,btohqsg
Then I better don't act that account liao...,btohqsg
Wan nearby order also have to pray have,btohqsg
If not pay deposit liao ended nv do,btohqsg
Cos car account now can't see other jobs liao,btohqsg
Thanks... Its been mths I didn't do liao üòÇ,btohqsg
During cv time good to do.. Cos less traffic..,btohqsg
Hi just to check with everyone here have anyone here received the 25% goodwill claim from lalamove before? Example customer doesn't want to pay and lalamove asks drivers to fill up the compensation form. Is the compensation form really true? Because I've had 4 incident over the years before and 4 claims were submitted but up till today I've not received a single one. Pls help a brother/driver out here. Thank you very muchüôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Well that one have to ask moto all those.. so far customers are paying to me..,btohqsg
Courier is walker and bikes right?,btohqsg
So no need specifically use lala move walker ma,btohqsg
Since most job is courier anyway,btohqsg
Only for moto and walker uh.. car diff,btohqsg
Hi guysüëãüèº. Can I check if I want to use Van but without pasting sticker how? I tried asking through CS but they say not possible. Cause I heard some Van drivers say can but deduct 20% comm?,btohqsg
Never. Use to taichi us only. If want to give Cs can give straight away. The form must fill in so many things must give proof all... At least can call us so can explain,btohqsg
Stuck with previous live chat session which is inactive already,btohqsg
I think if you try restarting it might help..?,btohqsg
I really dk how help also le... I never even contact live chat after the compensation nonsense..,btohqsg
But this is what they post.,btohqsg
U waited for 20min or 10min?,btohqsg
If ur order let say is9pm. At 915pm u took the order. U wont get the waiting compensation.9pm to 910pm is free of charge.If you get pick ur order at 921pm onwards  u get the compensation,btohqsg
If you accept the order and reject it too much  you will get kicked off the app..,btohqsg
Risk management bro go do your marketing ba,btohqsg
That's why have to see if it's really worth your time to deliver.. if not Don accept it in the first place.. unless really no choice that order is near then just take uh.. not trying to shoot people here but trying to say base on my experience,btohqsg
how much walker earn a day?,btohqsg
Depends how you plan your route,btohqsg
If you keep taking the orders that's far you wouldn't earn as much as nearby,btohqsg
Not really.. its just the b2b issue,btohqsg
Like for example I travel from plaza sing to clementi.. trying to find a b2b order go back to town,btohqsg
If you really planning to go further I suggest getting a conession ezlink,btohqsg
I spend almost $36 a day without conession,btohqsg
Yep  bag is not compulsory but if you want just take the small bag.. (just note that you can't carry pizza order and large items with it),btohqsg
I ownself got a 42L backpack Just to accommodate those larger orders..,btohqsg
Yesterday I mix 2 bags together was the worse choice of my life üòÇ,btohqsg
