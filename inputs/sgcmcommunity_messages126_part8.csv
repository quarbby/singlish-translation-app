Quote from outside articles:-There are differences in three items: the emissions in the use phase (by far the largest item in the case of the combustion engine)  the production and supply chain of raw materials and  in the case of the electric cars  battery production. Volvo puts the latter at around 4-5 tonnes of CO2 per vehicle.If you add up the individual items that occur until the car is handed over to the customer  the CO2 emissions of the C40 Recharge (and the all-electric XC40) are around 70 per cent higher than those of the combustion model. The big difference is in the use phase ‚Äì calculated at 200 000 kilometres.To fully exploit the potential of electric cars  Volvo Cars is therefore calling for more investment in clean energy. ‚ÄúWe need green power throughout the supply chain and production  not just in the use phase when charging ‚Äù says Otterheim.,btohqsg
This is not including battery disposal. Furthermore  Singapore‚Äôs primary source of electricity is fossil fuel. Are we really gonna shift pollution from a first world to a third world country and call that saving the earth?,btohqsg
It is just filled with lies.,btohqsg
