Quick question. Once reach BHS  does the supercharged to RA happens immediately? Or we only see the transfer to RA happens every new year?,btohqsg
Nope. Trying to reach BHS earlier,btohqsg
So I'm assuming you're talking about SA and not RA. Yes if you have reached your BHS (MA max)  your employee  employer and interest earned on MA will flow to your SA  assuming your SA has not reached FRS.,btohqsg
No need amaze. You kiasu can use it you want,btohqsg
Thx  will try without amaze 🙏,btohqsg

"CPF allocation table by ageAs you go above 35 years old  the allocation to both SA & MA increases to prepare for retirement. While OA allocation decreases as you become financially secure and depend less on CPF for housing  investment and education funds.This is an important table to refer to  especially when you are doing the ""Supercharge"" CPF strategy.Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysg",btohqsg
