Think that min amount else will have charges on the account,btohqsg
Hi there  Regardless of when you deposited fresh funds  starting from 20/5/2024  the reward distribution time for those who have not received their reward subsidy has been revised according to the Terms & COnditions (T&Cs). We hope to seek your kind understanding. You may still withdraw and deposit funds at any time  but you need to ensure that on the last day of the activity (16/7/2024  9:59PM SGT)  the net deposit calculated during the activity period (from 1/4/2024  10:00PM SGT to 16/7/2024  9:59PM SGT) meets the fresh fund deposit requirement based on the respective task.Meanwhile  to strengthen your trust  Moomoo offers additional coupon benefits. You can access the Cash Plus 6.8% annualized income promotion page Ôºàhttps://invest.sg.moomoo.com/investsmartereup2404Ôºâtoclaim it  ensuring your investment return. (Expected to be updated and launched on May 23rd  you can go to the activity page to claim it after the 6.8%p.a.earnings period ends.It should be noted that customers who receive a 60-day 6.8% p.a.earnings period can receive interest rate increase coupons 7 days before the 6.8% p.a. earnings period ends),btohqsg
Would this be too JIT? Or before 10am sat proven to be safe?,btohqsg
Thanks for highlighting this. Im aiming for 100k so i will still have some funds in UOB one even after trf out.,btohqsg
Saturday before 10am is safe. The cutoff for Saturday is usually 1pm/5pm/10pm  so 10am confirm safe.,btohqsg
They deleted the chat post in moomoo on this topic.Think many will be caught unaware of this new change to the 6.8% clause.,btohqsg
Yeaaa  I just found out too,btohqsg
Hi everyone  have a query for the UOB Big Savings Payout Promo..My March ADB was $104k.. then i funded another $50k to participate for additional $50k to get $250.. so the additional $50k was earmarked already on 21-May (and received the $250 liao).So my query is the the excess $4k can i withdraw without affecting my promo eligibility?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I noticed that my UOB one available balance is  20k higher than my reflected balance due to the UOB Big Savings payout promo where i supposed they are reflecting a lower balance  due to the clause of 'no withdrawal for 4 months'. I' m cool with that but does anyone know if the UOB one interest will be based on the true balance or the reflected balance (lower amount)? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
UOB One interest is based on Account (not available) Balance's MAB,btohqsg
For the updated tncs  20 May 2024  for moomoo cash plus 6.8% guaranteed return:For scenario 1  does it mean that one can withdraw the fund after 16 July 2024 9:59PM and it might take up to 14 working days (5 Aug 2024) to receive the delta returns?For scenario 2  assuming one‚Äôs qualifying period ends on 17 July 2024  he/she can withdraw on 18 July 2024 and it might take up to 7 working days (26 Jul 2024) to receive the delta returns?It seems as though it is more beneficial for those who participate in the promo later (scenario 2) as they dont have to lock up their funds longer to be assured of the 6.8% guaranteed returns.Am i missing something here?Thanks! üôè,btohqsg
Hi all. Using SMRT card to make atome payment is not always MCC 5999?Citibank told me that it‚Äôs charged under ‚ÄúMiscellaneous and Specialty Retail Stores and not online. ‚Äú therefore could not earn cashback. I thought atome always uses 5999. Any expert can advise me please.,btohqsg
Yes  too late for us that already joined earlier,btohqsg
To be clear  for scenario 1  we cannot withdraw even after the 20/40/60 days  in order to get the 6.8% returns  and we are only guaranteed the 6.8% returns for the 20/40/60 days?,btohqsg
Atome so far is 5999 but not always online.,btohqsg
No  you can withdraw after 20/40/60  but will not get extra $ as per 6.8% interest,btohqsg
What i meant was cannot withdraw to be eligible for the 6.8% returns. Edited my original query.,btohqsg
Uob promotion:March MAB:$87000Register May promo  31st May balance :$87000+ fresh fund 150k=$237000(31st May)On June  can I withdraw some fund out and maintain the MAB $150k and balance $150100 sit for the earmark on 20 June?,btohqsg
nope you cannotyou need to maintainMarch MAB amount (please look at app figure) + $150 000 + $10 buffer through the entire earmark promo,btohqsg
which means very lugi for u,btohqsg
Ya  will think of others method.,btohqsg
a number of us are totally emptying UOB One in June.. (leave $1001)then july participate,btohqsg
later UOB go and use AVERAGE OF THREE MONTHS MAB.. don't come find me ah,btohqsg
for supermarket spendings do y‚Äôall still use the citi rewards + instarem amaze combo?,btohqsg
i using UOB Lady Family category,btohqsg
Not even worth to put past 150k..,btohqsg
HmMy reading was otherwise as you need to keep the funds till 16 July.After 14 days from 16 July then they will issue the delta between the 6.8% and the fund output %.13. When will the cash reward from 6.8%p.a. be issued?The cash reward will be issued according to the following scenarios: Scenario 1 If your activity period (20/40/60 day) has ended before 16/7/2024 9:59pm SGT  the reward will be issued within 14 working days after 16/7/2024 9:59PM SGT.,btohqsg
So you are stuck in it for an extended period of time at the market rate which could be 3-3.5%?,btohqsg
Quite cunning of them to do this retrospective one sided change for moomoo cash plus,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGare you planning to do an update to your viewers on this?Think many subscribe to moomoo cash plus from your channel,btohqsg
Yes  that's why I thinking fund in 31st May to increase the fresh fund  then withdraw fund out for June to remain $150k MAB.üòÇ,btohqsg
is there surcharge for Instarem Amaze card when paying internet bills ?,btohqsg
Huh  are you joining this big savings promo? If yes  you can‚Äôt withdraw the funds out,btohqsg
1st June transfer out or which day?,btohqsg
Not sure if I‚Äôm missing out anythingMy atome is not coded at 5999.I bought something from a motorcycle shop and paid w atomeIt‚Äôs coded as 5533,btohqsg
If withdraw anytime  will still meet the fresh funds requirements?,btohqsg
I don't think it meets the requirements  if withdraw anytime,btohqsg
Is this a group chat or how to access? Am keen to participate,btohqsg
Its a oost under Fullerton cash fund,btohqsg
Thanks. Seems like it really depends on the merchant.,btohqsg
Try to find out the difference. Bisado has two mcc codes. 5533 and 5999.,btohqsg
i also not sure  the difference  i paid using revolution  wasted my $$ on it lol.,btohqsg
Can I ask1) any card that can earn points when paying bills on AXS?2) best way to top up revolut to earn points if any?,btohqsg
1). Search chat history ‚ÄúAxs earn card‚Äù2). Search chat history ‚ÄúRevolut top earn‚Äù,btohqsg
