Not all staying bukit timah has car porch for two cars charging. Some literally park along the roadside ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
If you could get half price but your petrol pump speed reduce by half how many of you would go for it?,btohqsg
Some stay condo too. Need wait for MCST. But I heard many just do charging at fast charger while having meal and groceries,btohqsg
I think most folks complain not to have the thing in their backyards,btohqsg
Actually silly question  cross the border itâ€™s 1/3 to 1/2 the petrol price here and still there will be people who drive 1-2 hours to get a cheaper fill of fuel ðŸ˜‹,btohqsg
This issue with mcst will always be there in the name of democracy,btohqsg
Vote for installation always take times,btohqsg
Especially grab drivers who go JB to pump petrol. Their 1 can earn extra $20-30 bucks. But yet risk and go JB pump.,btohqsg

Human requires more charging than EVs for sure at times,btohqsg
