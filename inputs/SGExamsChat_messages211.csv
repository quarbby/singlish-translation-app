Hi! I've sought permission from Caslyn  and was given the go ahead to blast here.,btohqsg
Just imagine if she actually typed that out here on Telegram only,btohqsg
I can repost it if necessary,btohqsg
Hello O/A Level students! Congratulations on completing your examinations (soon  for A level students :‚Äô‚Äô)Right now  you might be wondering what to do with all of the notes you have sitting at home. Before you toss them out  why not donate them to students in need?Jointly organised by REACH Academy and the People‚Äôs Association  Project renewABLE aims to collect used notes  scientific and graphic calculators¬† from recently graduated students and donate them to financially needy students.Your notes will also be converted into a digital format and stored in SGExams' online repository for future batches to use! For students moving into Upper Secondary and JC  this could be a great opportunity to acquire valuable tools to aid you in your journey!All unused notes will be recycled  so as to reduce paper wastage. Donation of online notes is also welcome!,btohqsg
Give your notes a new lease of life  and pay it forward! Project renewABLE will be held on the 28th of November  from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Bishan Town Council Multipurpose Hall.For more information about who we are and what we do  visit our website (via our IG@reachacad3my) or drop us a text in the chat! We'd be happy to answer your queries.We hope to see you there :D,btohqsg
Preferably science books others also can,btohqsg
can explain how pocong come about,btohqsg
Pocong is the entity when a soul from a dead person is not freed from the body after 40 days  so it would find any human to release it. This is done by untying the strings from the shroud (kain kafan). I think it's a legend bc the way muslims are buried is that there is a board that securely shields the body from the soil in the grave.,btohqsg
so yall are supposed to untie the strings?,btohqsg
if i remember correctly they go around jumping at ppl and asking them to untie their strings right,btohqsg
or am i wrong lmao oop,btohqsg
sadly the MOE ppl i encountered think otherwise,btohqsg
they seem to give the vibes that better cop = better school,btohqsg
Lol@chemcerdid you rant on the sub,btohqsg
So it was u all along Chemcer?,btohqsg
I'd be surprised if there weren't any,btohqsg
Then why u complain so much,btohqsg
if u are 0  im -1,btohqsg
our sch jc1 batch is v toxic so 100% agreed,btohqsg
yi aka the bottom tier :(,btohqsg
i feel like all the btr schs found the papers doable,btohqsg
but i have short attn span n short term memory so i have to go for exams based on covering the whole syllabus hours b4 the exam so it sticks but with this year paper i probs have to retail,btohqsg
ahhh i have short attn span too:(,btohqsg
hmmm maybe uhh try to limit distractions or smth,btohqsg
prob is im a distraction to myself.-.,btohqsg
every exam the only way i could focus was study frm 12 to 4am  with snacks and then sleep so that i can actually feel ok :/,btohqsg
if u try ur best idt ull retain thoo,btohqsg
i tried me best but yea these 2 years.. werent my best,btohqsg

Imagine traveling all the way from Chua Chu Kang to Changi Airport,btohqsg

Hihi anyone taking part in this camp?,btohqsg
Post Ur survey in the discord channel,btohqsg
the gp maths chem econs h1,btohqsg
I advise to go with friends it isnt that fun without them i think,btohqsg
ooo the qns for H1 Econs were really unusual imo,btohqsg
Come back here and predict SEA now,btohqsg
Wait wtf that message was from last year,btohqsg
If they aren't  it wont be called H1 Econs,btohqsg
I buy sausage  they charge me for it but never put in,btohqsg

Next year's paper will be easier,btohqsg
Some really novel q came out,btohqsg
But my sch spotted almost the entire 2nd case study so.... LOL,btohqsg
Same man my friends and I were experiencing de javu for the first CSQ of the H2 econs CSQ paper this year,btohqsg
Oh damn wait mine was 2017 too  paper was decently easy,btohqsg
Oh u all talkin abt bio,btohqsg
If bio 2017 p3 then ya easyGot like 64/75,btohqsg
I wrote out every single internediate,btohqsg
I wrote the ETC electrochem gradient and all its 5m or so,btohqsg
Respiration just write all the way feom glycolysis to krebs cycle to oxidative phosphorylation,btohqsg
yeah I got 15m for that,btohqsg
I wrote everything in the notes,btohqsg
But the ATP idk how get 10,btohqsg
I got like at least 5-6,btohqsg
Site of ATP synthesis  source of electron,btohqsg
Difference is cyclic Vs no cyclic,btohqsg
Oh I missed out on no cyclic or cyclic,btohqsg
I also talk about producing ATP by other forms for the synthesis of NTPs for transcripyion,btohqsg
I hope can do well la,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt so strict.. I got similarities only,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if nus merit applies to double degree programs?,btohqsg
So nus merit is only for single degree right,btohqsg
i think its not limited by what u take but not all facilities have nus merit,btohqsg
like med doesnt (i thinkK this im not too sure),btohqsg
I was originally planning on cs math,btohqsg
I think there was double deg cs math unless i saw wrongly,btohqsg
Be applying for admission to a full-time undergraduate degree programme at NUS  excluding Yale-NUS College and students in the Law and Liberal Arts Double Degree Programme offered by Yale-NUS College and NUS. Only limited scholarships are available for Dentistry  Medicine and Music.,btohqsg
What double degree u want do,btohqsg
mw u looking at ddp oso ah ü§©,btohqsg
or isit double not enuf wan go triple ü§î,btohqsg
I'm gonna try for ddp medicine and dentistry,btohqsg
Maths is the most natural second degree for CS,btohqsg
no one told me that there was matrices,btohqsg
cut off is 90 for it,btohqsg
My As is next year so i hope my pw A first haha,btohqsg
Or i can scrap that off my lkst,btohqsg
nus cs and biz double degree also is cfm AAA/AAA,btohqsg
Is cs super popular amongst other sgeans,btohqsg
yes cos most ppl are in for the money,btohqsg
but its gonna die down soon,btohqsg
but ofc some ppl in cs do have the interest for it,btohqsg
CS is popular in the world,btohqsg
time for a new breed of test tube washers to dominate the world,btohqsg
can anyone share their internship experience HAHAHA slsjsj,btohqsg
I guess not HAHAH ty for reading,btohqsg
Is it possible for Uniqlo to scam me,btohqsg
That a company like Uniqlo though,btohqsg
Like not pay me for part time work,btohqsg
But they would not do it,btohqsg
Inside is a mini version of nba 2k,btohqsg
Later SDA check those people playing üèÄ disappeared,btohqsg
Buy the 20 cent ball also,btohqsg
I will bonk bedok bunk and bonk bedok,btohqsg
Cuz rich people are buying them!,btohqsg
Ooo so you don't like viewian,btohqsg
Yao teck is a pretty lit name,btohqsg
My grandmother always call me shun shun,btohqsg
Cuz my last name is shuen,btohqsg
Oh i thgt its bc everyone called u bedok altho u were bedok viewian so u j dropped the viewian,btohqsg
Then a lot people say nixon sia lah!,btohqsg
I try to make it like pop star hair,btohqsg
Making into korean boys hairstyle is hella tough,btohqsg
With my hair right now only 2 to 3 cm long,btohqsg
Double major haha  not double degree,btohqsg
Double degree I thought need lie contrasting subject,btohqsg
Like arts and science or smt,btohqsg
depends on whether u are an o lvl/a lvl/poly graduate,btohqsg
usually for o and a lvl students  amt of internships available is super limited. Even if there are any  its gonna get extremely competitive,btohqsg
there will always a more talented person there,btohqsg
that wants lesser pay and then wow everyone no job already,btohqsg
Most double degrees complement each other,btohqsg
Cause you can take modules that overlap with both degrees,btohqsg
Rather than actually doubling your workload,btohqsg
One day it will be 1cm long all over,btohqsg
If my brother need to book in and his sergeant ask him to cut his hair  then 1 month 2 times,btohqsg
Oh damn should i still pursue it,btohqsg
Cos I heard from NUS double degree is like art and science,btohqsg
Double major is like math and physics,btohqsg
it's a good place for money  however in 10 years  offer something that everyone will not be able to and make it the selling point,btohqsg
Also does uni provide connections or networking,btohqsg
either way that is amazing one,btohqsg
Do they have any in sg im curious,btohqsg
As long as u are talented enough u dont have to worry,btohqsg
U can be in cambridge but not chosen to go silicon valley if u are bad,btohqsg
NOC SV does modules at Stanford yes,btohqsg
Is ntu usp basically the nus merit of ntu?,btohqsg
USP is not a scholarship  it's basically an elite programme where unlike the commoners who take normal general education modules  you take some special seminar project stuff in replacement and also you live in a residential college in UTown,btohqsg
I'm content with being commoner lol  hopefully NUS accepts my sh*t grades,btohqsg
H2 History yesterday was such a massacre I got no tears left to cry,btohqsg
wait fkkk he was talking about ntu,btohqsg
damnit ahahahah ok ntu im not sure but that's nus usp lel sorry,btohqsg
does anyone know if there's a chance for an NSF to do free labour in a lab,btohqsg
Intern all got pay one hahaz like 400-500,btohqsg
But u need get a lab to accept u first,btohqsg
as in I can't moonlight mah,btohqsg
Yes work 7 days a week,btohqsg
She intern for one entire year,btohqsg
idh the privilege to do so,btohqsg
I take 2 gap years to intern at SAF,btohqsg
But must have lab to accept u first,btohqsg
do you know anywhere I can start w?,btohqsg
Or Ur sch link u up to some uni,btohqsg
U super talented in a field,btohqsg
JC lack the lab expeieence also,btohqsg
I can go there sweep floor also,btohqsg
Ur purpose of interning at the lab,btohqsg
Is to get the wet lab experience right?,btohqsg
it's just to see how the lab operates,btohqsg
and what the professors usually do in a lab,btohqsg
I can share with u via PM if u want haha,btohqsg
it's better to immerse yourself within that environment ah,btohqsg
Just want to go there for a few days,btohqsg
If u want to like see how it looks like inside etc,btohqsg
I can maybe ask my prof if can bring u there see see,btohqsg
maybe I should just call off the idea HAHA,btohqsg
But I also intern finish alr,btohqsg
And like I did it thru my sch,btohqsg
And there's alot of paper work etc,btohqsg
hahaha too bad I got rejected by H3 research,btohqsg
Just for u to even touch the appaatus,btohqsg
I thought got like the normal one,btohqsg
But he intern for 3 months,btohqsg
He send email to a few different labs on Astar,btohqsg
To ask if he can intern there,btohqsg
So like he doing A level + intern at same time,btohqsg
Cos his NS in Janurary also,btohqsg
I can check with him abt it if u I inerested,btohqsg
I'll text him and ask what he send haha,btohqsg
Get ready a CV suited for Science Research,btohqsg
Like the science conference u attend,btohqsg
idrh experience w doing science research,btohqsg
u can try applying to nbl yrp,btohqsg
Oh ya  I rmb there's a lab,btohqsg
they hv a v structured student internship prog,btohqsg
I'll check it out  thanks :p,btohqsg
ns do be a bitch sometimes,btohqsg
worth a shot tho if u thinking of doing research,btohqsg
But I'm not sure if they accept NSF ah,btohqsg
Cos that one the commitment quite high,btohqsg
the min commitment is 4 weeks full time,btohqsg
Crazy  how big is their lab üòÇ,btohqsg
used to be v big lol but now they‚Äôre one level,btohqsg
but then again its astar so even their one level is p huge,btohqsg
also idk if this is the right place to ask but does anyone hv any h3 econs notes / readings,btohqsg
doesnt rly hv to be h3 oso can be anything related to econs just wanna read up abit more,btohqsg

Chemcer at least 2 people want u dead,btohqsg
He must be speaking in the language of gods,btohqsg
unless you are tony tan's son,btohqsg
he got posted to some lab,btohqsg
for the rest of his NS,btohqsg
Dont other pap sons also get preferrential treatment,btohqsg
Rumor has it that LHL got stayout OCS,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôm a JC1   JC2 next yearAny NUS/NTU  students here?What are the unis looking for in the portfolios?Are they looking for school leadership positions (Orientation Group Leader or are they looking for vocational experience( intern at hospital... or something related to the course you want to take in uni)?An answer would be most appreciated :),btohqsg
I think we can give more specific answers if you tell us what programmes you have in mind. Tbh the requirements differ based on what programmes you‚Äôre looking at.,btohqsg
tbh dont base what you do on what you think unis want,btohqsg
do what you like  and do it well,btohqsg
take up leadership positions because you want to  not because of some stupid uni entrance,btohqsg
In hindsight  uni admission is just a small stupid part of the whole process lmao,btohqsg
more important that you do what you enjoy and lead what you are passionate in,btohqsg
I‚Äôm mainly looking at science based courses (engineering/ science),btohqsg
"else you are gonna waste your JC life just chasing ""success"" in some club you aint even passionate in. And those club members that are under you have have to bear with some half fuck leader who is in position just to beef up his portfolio",btohqsg
i‚Äôm asking mainly because i dont have any significant leadership positions and i was wondering if relying on internship experience would be better,btohqsg
not from what i heard from my friends,btohqsg
for overseas  yeah (if you happen to be considering cambridge) lmaooo,btohqsg
AlrightThanks.Haha noo i just put that name for fun,btohqsg
GP pass is enough  which is an E,btohqsg
Is polytechnic or a levels better for that,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre not looking to enter any special programmes  RP is enough.,btohqsg
If you are not looking to enter uni O level is enough,btohqsg
if you are looking to be an encik PSLE is enough,btohqsg
If u arent vying for scholarships  its ok,btohqsg
if u are  dont worry also  rp more impt LOL,btohqsg
I heard that it‚Äôs mainly SAT and your extracurricular,btohqsg
Like they desire high achievers that can actually change society,btohqsg
Day 12 give it up for day 12,btohqsg
Guess I will have Koi for dinner,btohqsg
How important is leadership roles to apply to nus merit for cs*,btohqsg
If got 90 rp and you not applying to competitive courses then will get,btohqsg
Im planning to go to cs,btohqsg
If no 90 rp then you need portfolio to back it up,btohqsg
So if i no leadership will events like via or smtg cover it up?,btohqsg
You'll just need to fill up the form and hope you get the interview,btohqsg
The form has some leadership questions also,btohqsg
So might be a bit hard to show if you don't have at least some leadership role,btohqsg
But in the end it's how you phrase,btohqsg
You can be president of student council or something  but it'll be useless if you can't say what you did,btohqsg
You can also be some publicity exco of a dying chess club  but impress NUS if you managed to show how you tripled the size of the CCA,btohqsg
my original course was math lol,btohqsg
now it looks like I'm telling Jay to diam,btohqsg
doesn't seem like a very nice guy tbh,btohqsg
ah ya cos u are ddp right,btohqsg
figured i wont have a life if im in a ddp,btohqsg
Im curious why do many people talk about nus merit but not as much talk about ntu usp?,btohqsg
They seem somewhat equivalents of each other,btohqsg
u dont rly need 90 rp to get ntu usp,btohqsg
Is being in ntu usp cs better than being in nus cs without scholarship,btohqsg
all i can say is nus cs is on a whole different level as compared to ntu cs,btohqsg
Could you elaborate more? Im quite curious,btohqsg
since when can fishes be sad,btohqsg
the picture i only can send on tues,btohqsg
nus cs is a b.comp  ntu cs is a b.eng,btohqsg
my cap would have tanked big time if i was in cs this sem,btohqsg
already had an appetiser into how bad it can possibly be in GET1031,btohqsg
oh what's the format for GET1031,btohqsg
I need to find 2 UEs to do next sem,btohqsg
dear lord ok i'm avoiding it,btohqsg
cross my fingers I can get the CSCU GES,btohqsg
write about a problem in society that can possibly be addressed by computational thinking (5% of overall grade),btohqsg
write about a reflection on what you have learnt in GET1031(5% of overall grade),btohqsg
LOL i clearing all my GEMS asap,btohqsg
actually GEM you should spread them out to balance out workload,btohqsg
first time in my fkin life,btohqsg
i see 2 null hypothesis in a study,btohqsg
i alr cleared 2 this sem including ger,btohqsg
next sem prob preallocate geq and 1 UE to choose,btohqsg
yeah my 1st sem I clear GER and GES also,btohqsg
fast and furious is the way to go,btohqsg
i plan to go on internship in y2/y3,btohqsg
So for cs if one gets 90 rp but no leadership stuff  more or less is it cfm get in?,btohqsg
if I can secure the CSCU GES for my next sem  then I can effectively have a 3 CSCU sem :'),btohqsg
cause I still have 2 SUs,btohqsg
and i have 2 cores  3 UEs left to clear,btohqsg
Woah woah calm down calm down,btohqsg
man is already drowning in chemistry,btohqsg
I don't know if it is a good thing or a bad thing... NUS condenses comp arch into 1 module  NTU does it in 2. Same with data structures & algo  same with intro prog,btohqsg
dont drown me in further sorrows,btohqsg
cs1010s is phasing out memoization next sem,btohqsg
my 1010 didn't even have memoization,btohqsg
that's something i learnt in 3230 when formally learning dynamic programming,btohqsg
Why though do they teach different things 9r,btohqsg
content taught can be similar  but questions asked can be very different,btohqsg
but i've never seen ntu stuff before so i cannot comment,btohqsg
Does one focus on application and the other memorisation?,btohqsg
i don't think it is possible to memorise your way through any computing course sorry LOL,btohqsg
If you can do it go for it man memorising in cs,btohqsg
Still whats the main differencr beteeen ntu and nus cs,btohqsg
Lol I was just surprised u didn't know earlier,btohqsg
But the point of a scholarship is to attract people to the school,btohqsg
So think about the kind of ppl nus wants,btohqsg
Idk how people can give a good review of it tbh,btohqsg
It's not as though they sat through both degrees,btohqsg
Or how people give good comparison,btohqsg
Normally NUS CS is around 85 I think,btohqsg
True but i dont know what they mean by nus cs is very diffrrent from ntu cs,btohqsg
And i dont really wanna choose the wrong sch,btohqsg
more ppl end up in silicon valley from nus than ntu,btohqsg
As though there is a 'right' school,btohqsg
Just...don't choose NTU CS as much as u can,btohqsg
the monthly pay gap between nus and ntu cs differs by at least 4 digits,btohqsg
Or the school i dont prefer,btohqsg
If you knew what you prefer they you'll chose the correct one alr what,btohqsg
Every path you take you'll have regrets one,btohqsg
literally all cs students right now,btohqsg
Once a choice is made no point lamenting over whether it was a good choice,btohqsg
''12/50 for finals can get C''?,btohqsg
i couldn't do 75% of a finals and got C+,btohqsg
Maybe that will be me tmr,btohqsg
but... u are a USP student!!,btohqsg
You are the bell curve wreckers of all wreckers on the curve,btohqsg
It just means we write more essays than most people,btohqsg
and $50k school debt upon graduation,btohqsg
Plenty of brilliant people outside of usp as well,btohqsg
Why does igp assume gp and pw c?,btohqsg
so even if u lack abit u can still grt in?,btohqsg
if u assume gp pw c,btohqsg
then ur igp shld b higher,btohqsg
so maybe u get ppl w better geades applying,btohqsg
true ranking of NUS shld be 60th ish,btohqsg
and NTU to be almost 100,btohqsg
Nope  the rules apply equally to everyone  though you mean well  no promotions means no promotions unless approved,btohqsg
Does cambridge use microsoft word to format the papers,btohqsg
It would be quite funny to imagine them moving a table and everything screws up,btohqsg
Since it can be easily hacked,btohqsg
Have u observed how some past year papers have so many random ‚Äúdots‚Äù on their paper,btohqsg
And the font is like it has been done by a typewritter,btohqsg
Yeah the font is Helvetica not Arial,btohqsg
Oh yes I can definitely tell those 2 fonts apart,btohqsg
Bball Tuesday PM if not raining?,btohqsg
LOL CLEAN AIR IS FOR COMMIES,btohqsg
Here is a sharing on my career journey for those who are a bit lacking or slow in the career aspect of their life. Hopefully it can bring some hope and encouragement to those who are down especially in this economy. I am a female currently in late 20s. My job journey did not start out smoothly until later on and I tend to be the sort who would not easily get good job offers.After graduating from uni  it took me 6 months to get a fulltime job offer despite putting effort to a...,btohqsg
i think it is an interesting post,btohqsg
and maybe it would provide some guidance,btohqsg
for seeking jobs later in the future,btohqsg
If the females have it hard  dont the guys have it worse?,btohqsg
Reservist commitment and 2 years less worki g experience,btohqsg
reservist govt will payback to company,btohqsg
but the 2 yrs that one LLST,btohqsg
but its common practice that the 2yrs difference not be taken into consideration when applying for entry level,btohqsg
But the guy cannot br used ma,btohqsg
No matter how you look at it  no reservist is better,btohqsg
its like what 2 weeks out of 52 weeks a year,btohqsg
then all the men dont need job alrd lo,btohqsg
employers know what they're getting into de la,btohqsg
It should be common knowledge to seek jobs before graduating,btohqsg
plus they cant stop you from gg reservist,btohqsg
But they can choose to hire female,btohqsg
most employers need to adhere to TAFEP,btohqsg
Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices,btohqsg
any employees of the company can choose to complain on an anon basis if they feel that the company is not adhering to them,btohqsg
But if you insist that the males have a disadvantage due to reservist commitments  then liddat lo,btohqsg
Ok HR Manager  I will take your words with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
