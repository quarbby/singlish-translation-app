Yes it excludes the non eligible transactions. It is accurate. Do note it is based on transaction posted date and not date of transaction (T). Posted date is typically T+2.,btohqsg

Hi gurus   is ocbc titanium a better card to get than citi bank rewards card?,btohqsg
depending on ur annual income >500k  one of those 1.6mpd cards>120k  DBS Vantage (1.5mpd cards)https://carduphelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024526894-Will-my-spend-on-CardUp-earn-rewards-on-my-credit-card-,btohqsg
Thanks  i can see there're a long list of them. Do you see they're pretty much offer the same value?Or is there any specific ones which stand out?,btohqsg
Is there a way to waive off annual fee of those 1.5/1.6 miles cards?,btohqsg
can citi cash back link to amaze to earn the cash back when pay insurance using amaze?,btohqsg
see if the benefits worth for you or not  if not have to settle for lower mpd (for cardup),btohqsg

Is it the CRMC + Amaze 10x only applies to google pay? Is it valid for paying with physical card for Apple users?,btohqsg
Can pair up Citi rewards with Kris + pay to earn the Kris + bonus plus the 10x point with Citi rewards?,btohqsg
Anyone can shed any light on this?,btohqsg
I dont think so? Because amaze won't change the mcc code. And insurance mcc are excluded,btohqsg
"my bad  didn't see the word ""insurance""",btohqsg
Best to call OCBC and verify,btohqsg
Kris+ pairs with mobile wallet and Citi rewards does not earn 10x with mobile wallet. Use CRMC with Amaze will do,btohqsg
Oh...then what is the best miles cards to pair with Kris + to get the Kris + bonus miles and yet also get the credit card bonus miles? Hbsc revolution?,btohqsg
Does Car Rental eligible for points with DBS woman world or Citibank Rewards card?,btohqsg
Citibank - No (remember seeing it under Travel MCCs),btohqsg
Dependent on underlying MCC so... CRMC(for huge ticket  DBS WWMC  or UOB KF ),btohqsg
This one really depends on the merchant. HSBC Revolution should still give 4mpd for most merchants  but if you want 4mpd for all Kris+ purchases your best bet is to link Citi Rewards to Amaze and link Amaze to Google Pay,btohqsg
Kris + payment is from Google pay. Anyone try Kris + with Amaze card from Google pay...where in the back end Amaze is link3$ to Citi rewards. Anyone try this successfully... Getting the Kris + Bonus miles (for eg 6 or 9 miles per dollar) and also 4 miles per dollar from the citi rewards? And net 10 miles per dollar spent?,btohqsg
citi rewards+Amaze should also get 4mpd for taxi booking ah,btohqsg
Even through Kris+? I thought that one was only on Grab/Gojek,btohqsg

Does anyone know if UOB EVOL cash back works for contactless used overseas?,btohqsg

If you are referring to OCBC 360 account  your Minimum Average Daily Balance should not be less than $3K. Else  you will be charged for fall below fee at $2. But first year will be waived.https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/deposits/360-savings-accountAs for the OCBC 365 Credit Card  I assume you talking about the promotion. You can read up the term and condition on the link below.https://www.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/ocbc-365-credit-cardA ‚Äúnew OCBC Cardmember‚Äù refers to any person who (i) currently does not hold an existingOCBC Credit Card  and (ii) has not held an OCBC Credit Card within the last six (6) monthsprior to the commencement of the Promotion. Applicants who had cancelled existing OCBCCredit Card facilities within the last six (6) months prior to the commencement of thePromotion and re-applied for such facilities under the Promotion are not eligible to participatein the Promotion. For the avoidance of doubt  existing supplementary OCBC Credit Cardcardholders who do not hold any OCBC Credit Card as a principal cardholder are eligible toparticipate in the Promotion.If you still have concern you can call OCBC and confirm as well.,btohqsg
