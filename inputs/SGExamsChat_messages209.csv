yes  why did u abuse ur wife?,btohqsg
How do u all find yesterday's combined bio/chem paper?,btohqsg
Wa u bio/chem tutor ah. Nowadays quite a number of students looking for this combination tutor,btohqsg
I can tutor chemistry  physics  biology O levels in order of strengths,btohqsg
I like sciences but politics in office makes it shitty. Haha,btohqsg
They are working to cut those shitty politics though. Hope they succeed,btohqsg
Just like u r drinking a very nice cup of coffee in an oven like environment. Makes that cup shitty. üòÇ,btohqsg
Thats why ppl come out n thrive freelance,btohqsg
Haha didnt know u are a fellow chem tutor also,btohqsg
A lvls? Or only O lvls  or both?,btohqsg
A level can't yet. Need refresh.Tho technically I can teach.,btohqsg
Anything with science even computing excites me. Haha,btohqsg
O lvls shld be quite ok haha,btohqsg
Yep thats why easy to perfect it,btohqsg
setters should  design questions to instill more thinking,btohqsg
But i think for o lvl students to all of a sudden take up to 9 subjects  a bit hard,btohqsg
maybe give a problem statement  ask student to identify first which concept to use  and then design a solution to solve it,btohqsg
The only thing they can do tbh is to destroy the problem of spotting qns,btohqsg
maybe that would be a game changer,btohqsg
start with just one question first,btohqsg
maybe that question can carry 10 marks. haha,btohqsg
I believe they are trying already  for o lvl pure chem its in the form of 'data based qns',btohqsg
say u want to design a chemical production plant to produce some chemical A ,btohqsg
wat reactants are needed - chemical equation,btohqsg
how to improve the yield of A?,btohqsg
how to calculate rate of rxn etc,btohqsg
I see prelim qns tryin to ask these tho,btohqsg
put less weightage on O levels,btohqsg
maybe 20%. 80% on projects and teamwork,btohqsg
In case anyone wants a spoiler for Mac :Seaweed and samurai burger is coming out on the 19th of Nov-Idk if anyone here even likes macs .-.,btohqsg

You just sent to a group with 2.5k people,btohqsg
For a moment i read as hokkaido mint,btohqsg
Yes been around for quite long!!,btohqsg
Idk if anyone shares my tastes but I'm craving their ebi burger,btohqsg
or help friends with homework for their acc idk,btohqsg
Can ask A Maths and POA  which one is easier?,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt take POA  so no comments,btohqsg
Anyone took POA? Any comments on the subject?,btohqsg
U need a lot of practice,btohqsg
To see where u went wrg when u cant balance,btohqsg
Both equally easy and if you are a language person go for poa and if you are a math person go for amath,btohqsg
Piracy streaming sites are your friends,btohqsg
Poa is easy if you put in effort to memorise the different formats and theories. Amath is easy if you practice lots of math qns.,btohqsg
If you deciding between the two to see which subj to take  I recommened taking Amath if you intend to go sci stream in JC with H2 math.,btohqsg
I use this for Doctor Who and Supernatural,btohqsg
Anybody know any agencies to find part time jobs in?,btohqsg
Jobstreet jobscentral jobsbank recruitexpress adecco ackermanglobalsearch kellyservices tempserve,btohqsg
If any1 here was from EJC and took H2 Chem (Current JC2 A lvl or graduated)  do pm me. Thanks!,btohqsg
I have pure science but don‚Äôt have A maths does it mean I cannot Ho to science stream in JC?,btohqsg
idk ah but safe safe for non amath student is h1 math lor,btohqsg
unless they have that bridging session or wtv it is,btohqsg
H2 math is possible for lower tier jcs without amath if emath is A1,btohqsg
But to be honest H2 Math statistics section does rlly require A mathBut the pure math part of h2 math requires A LOT OF A MATH,btohqsg
I don't think its advisable unless u can learn some of the A math syb on ur own first,btohqsg
But i still did ok for h2 math,btohqsg
Ya. It just requires a good gc really,btohqsg
I dont rly think one is at a disadvantage much without it,btohqsg
Its just like how someone takin combined sci wants to take h2 chem,btohqsg
If my course in Uni does not require H2 Maths can I just take H2 sciences but without h2 maths?,btohqsg
I have pure science for Sec but without a maths,btohqsg
I thought u must take a maths if u take pure science?,btohqsg
H2 chem and comb chem much larger than e math to h2 math imo,btohqsg
The former has a lot more diff,btohqsg
H2 math is basically e math at a lvls,btohqsg
Cos u studied the syllabus alr what,btohqsg
And H2 F math is A math at a levels,btohqsg
But comb phy to H2 phy,btohqsg
Doesnt matter cos its gonna be covered again,btohqsg
Since O level phy has its similarities with H2 Phy,btohqsg
I think combined to H2.. learning curve v steep,btohqsg
My classmates struggled  very painful watchin them,btohqsg
But the reverse is also true,btohqsg
The first few topics on dynamics yes,btohqsg
Got mid term and end of year holidays,btohqsg
Just that most ppl end up playin,btohqsg
I found h2 chem easier than pure chem,btohqsg
a why is organic chem so weird i am watching it and it is like what,btohqsg
H2 chem organic chem is still basicOnly the application/novel qns are kind of tricky,btohqsg
U are not taking it yet right?,btohqsg
Oo did ur sch cover phy chem in j1?,btohqsg
then they say some willow tree,btohqsg
So they nvr do org chem?,btohqsg
and they show things like this,btohqsg
So u learnt acid base and solubility equilibria?,btohqsg
they do all the galvanic cells,btohqsg
What are you guys doing now on Saturday ://///,btohqsg
Thinking about what's the point of life loll,btohqsg
My advice is dont choose sci stream. You will suffer in h2 math.,btohqsg
hi sexies does anyone have part time job recos that allow u to only work weekdays that arent fast food and bbt?,btohqsg
i managed to find such jobs,btohqsg

Don‚Äôt jump to conclusions like that k,btohqsg
Please check out the definition of ‚Äúdox‚Äù,btohqsg
You can't conclude his name from his bio  and so what you have said is additional information,btohqsg
Does that mean you can assume I‚Äôm trying to dox?,btohqsg
Right okay maybe dox is too harsh,btohqsg
But don't try to name anyone here,btohqsg
It's nothing against you  and unless the other person is comfortable with his name being revealed  I will continue deleting messages that reveal names,btohqsg
Right I'm chill  I shouldn't have said dox,btohqsg
I saw a name and overreacted basically,btohqsg

Rotting at home is a nightmare,btohqsg
It's F9 for all  i.e. 54....,btohqsg
thats good  at least you are making good use of ur time now before o lvl results release.,btohqsg
More than enough time to lepak now until results release even if you are working,btohqsg
how did u find a job omg,btohqsg
depends on what kind of PT u looking for,btohqsg
if u want events kind can find on tele,btohqsg
can just walk in and ask if they're hiring,btohqsg
Pt jobs mainly warehouse  temperature screener  banquet and packer,btohqsg
Is mainly this kind of jobs,btohqsg
That's not how you're supposed to play the game,btohqsg
I mean if it works it works,btohqsg
Weird qn...are we allowed to sell O level exam papers to others?,btohqsg
But its hard to expect most pt jobs to not be tiring,btohqsg
how long do ppl work warehouse?,btohqsg
earning money from a pt job is better than staying at home without a job during holidays,btohqsg
just dunno if its worth the switch,btohqsg
just stay on with what u are doin ba,btohqsg
are u planning to find 1 after the sem ends?,btohqsg
Hi... I'm just curious how u guys clear always ur notes ?,btohqsg
If the part time job never specify the contract duration  shd I still apply,btohqsg
Jk sell on caruosell or smth,btohqsg
PT notice period very short de,btohqsg
Oh really becus usually I see those pt jobs all 3 months contract,btohqsg
I teach u  minimum commitment is 3 mths cos need training all. If i take u in for 1 mth u quit  i train you for fuck right?,btohqsg
U dont say u can commit how long,btohqsg
Just go say can commit then when sch gg start tell em cannot work alrd,btohqsg
Did anyone here apply for USP,btohqsg
I stand about 5 to 6 hours? I think,btohqsg
9 hours of work 1 hr break,btohqsg
That gives you 75 dollar a day,btohqsg
Den u have another job ?,btohqsg
If I enlisting in jan what are my options for jobs over dec haha,btohqsg

temp screening/safe entry kind minimum how long haha,btohqsg
Idk sia  maybe u can try email them to check,btohqsg
The pay actually not bad thou,btohqsg
But I don't think they will hire for one month,btohqsg
Double my fast food restraint pay,btohqsg
nvm maybe i just slack 1 month then take the ns payü§ß,btohqsg
But the only prob with the job is that they never say the commitment,btohqsg
Surely need u commit like 6 month one haha,btohqsg
