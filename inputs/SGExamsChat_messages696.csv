no  easier than before with the Internet,btohqsg
Everything about phy to si yan is easy,btohqsg
his dad is a phy uni lecturer too,btohqsg
it's about the train of thought,btohqsg
I was surprised by my chem results,btohqsg
phy olympiad like genuinely isn’t that hard,btohqsg
So just ask him continue what he is doing,btohqsg
you just can’t think of it in the same way you’d whack h2,btohqsg
I just attempted the vj WA1 for J2s this year. 15 MCQ around 15 mins done liao,btohqsg
it's simple not because concept are simplebut because of the questions always repeating the same style,btohqsg
theres a diff way of understanding needed for uni level physics stuff,btohqsg
H2 just whack enough you’ll get it,btohqsg
even if understanding not fully there,btohqsg
I have a topical summaries for my students  and it's like it summarises the different styles which could be tested for a chapter.So just need read through to revise because the testing styles repeat year after year,btohqsg
for eg for the chapter of Forces in terms of turning effectsyou only have f × perpendicular distanceor perpendicular component of force × distand apply to horizontal plank or slanted plankor ladder kind of questionor both perpendicualr components also exert moments (JJC old question regarding Michael Jackson 45 degrees dance)and if extend to other chapters will be like EM current balance.,btohqsg
or a ball or cylinder rolling up a stepor a block on a platform with normal reaction force exerting a moment about the c.g. (old hci question) and causing it to topple,btohqsg
ANY FINAL TIPS FOR ENGLISH ORAL PLS?,btohqsg
it’s ok i carried on that tradition in ntu,btohqsg
and I'll be your successor 🫡,btohqsg
What are u saying….but I can say the same thing for H1,btohqsg
But H2 chem is much easier than H2 physics I think,btohqsg
🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥,btohqsg
No comments coz i dun take bio,btohqsg
But bio is the most content heavy one of the 3,btohqsg
you said your temp pw grouping become permanent right,btohqsg
If you j1 why would that matter,btohqsg
I mean getting a pass is almost guaranteed,btohqsg
If it’s as easy as getting E and above in the older pw syllabus,btohqsg
have to memorise a lot of stuff,btohqsg
the lowest i ever heard is a C,btohqsg
Ya exactly you have nothing to worry about. Even if one of them is a slacker you just need to be concerned about whether you can pass.,btohqsg
i am not sure about that though,btohqsg
the other grps maybe having a bit more trouble,btohqsg
i neither took geog nor bio,btohqsg
Probably still gonna have a 100% pass rate in the end,btohqsg
my friend say i should report if the boy in my pw grp,btohqsg
Try to speak to Ur st yeah,btohqsg
like about not having the boy in my grp ?,btohqsg
Yeah true I guess but at least with the individual component  there’s almost no way one can fail as long as they put in effort.,btohqsg
I will just get it done and over with and forget those crap group mates,btohqsg
But also since it’s mentioned that a pw pass is needed to gain entry into local unis  I wonder what happens to those who fail,btohqsg
Like idk how can they retake,btohqsg
if you fail pw in j1  you have to do a mini pw in j2 that is individual work (the j1 pw is ridiculously difficult to fail)my teacher say if you still fail the mini pw  then really a bit no hope alr,btohqsg
my grp shld still be fine,btohqsg
Oh ok I wonder if they can take the individual work pw as a Private,btohqsg
@kohsyanYou have a bachelors in physics right?,btohqsg
wtf  what kind of mini pw,btohqsg
idk i dont intend to find out because i hope i'll pass y5 pw,btohqsg
but my cher say the mini pw is like spoonfeeding one so if even that one you fail is you really need to reevaluate life choices,btohqsg
U know VJ allows students to choose their groups,btohqsg
I swear bio is worst lol,btohqsg
one of the girls in my class have autism,btohqsg
bio had things similar to geog,btohqsg
then after our pw lesson today one guy in her grp deadass came up to me begging for help,btohqsg
What is up with that boy,btohqsg
About her being in his group??,btohqsg
I’m confused coz my brother said his Cher let them decide their own groups,btohqsg
Long story short but he was one of the reasons why I had very bad mental health in jh,btohqsg
Ah ic  I think can check with ST whether there will be moderation or what not,btohqsg
Like she needs a group ultimately,btohqsg
Oh he is in the same class as u now also ah,btohqsg
Btw it is possible to get the tutor to change group,btohqsg
So u can try talking to your tutor about it,btohqsg
Autistic people have very specific talents,btohqsg
"Yea...I thought he was gonna take physics cause he took ""advance"" physics in jh (is like a dhs exclusive program  basically learn more jc stuff or extra coursework) ... he took bcme...",btohqsg
I know coz someone in my class did so,btohqsg
ngl idrc if he is in my group  is just that my friend told me he did nothing when she was in his group for some extracurricular activity,btohqsg
Ah ic but under pass fail  I dun think reporting and going through the hassle will do anything tbh,btohqsg
But tbh pass fail dun really affect the grading bah,btohqsg
but to be frank right  i dont think is appropriate to ask the teacher to change  because1. is not like he is chronic freeloader or drag down the group (*cough* that 1 girl which is a story for another day)2. my problem with him is a personal problem which im not comfortable to let other people irl know  and is a bit unprofessional to like let my own feelings affect my work,btohqsg
This one should be in sge tele hall of fame,btohqsg
But pw tho pass fail  it is like working with him for the enter year until November  so if he is gonna lead to ur mental health problems  then maybe better to try switching groups,btohqsg
i will see how it goes  since there are 5 guys in my fem majority class  the teacher say the 5 guys will be evenly split and its random grouping (which i think is cap cause someone told me they sort by olvl or ip gpa  and each group have at least 1 who got A for ip english or olvl el)   theres a 20% chance i will get him in my group  if i do is time to buy 4d/j,btohqsg
Bedok's legacy has inspired future nsfs who can potentially become ckws,btohqsg
Oh wah  i dunno how my cher gave the grps coz i was absent during the day he released the groups,btohqsg
I didnt know they take into acct the english grades to be fair,btohqsg
But tbh i dun think anyone in my grp was gd at eng,btohqsg
To those who are familiar with assassin’s creed  which notable figures in Singapore’s history do you think could be assassins or Templars?,btohqsg
I give u groundsheet  count all for me,btohqsg
Neh mind  i email ur oc,btohqsg
oh i heard that from a student not a teacher so i think it may differ from school to school plus it's not 100% accurate  so do take it with grain of salt,btohqsg
The person who failed English in my class got in same grp as someone who got A1,btohqsg
I think it depends on the tutors tbh,btohqsg
But i think the person who scored A in English in my grp trf to another grp,btohqsg
So my group no more A,btohqsg
How did u do tht makeup,btohqsg
Or u randomly send pic of a stranger,btohqsg
but the makeup looks rly clean,btohqsg
How did the person who failed English get into jc,btohqsg
Oh ya forgot this option existed,btohqsg
Redo the creation of the universe,btohqsg
It’s just like mtl E8 and below,btohqsg
Oh there is such a thing??,btohqsg
Is it as long as l1r5 qualify for jc,btohqsg
Eh u dun say…if it is like that im on the spectrum too,btohqsg
Coz that was what i did too ngl,btohqsg
Ok not the social interaction part but the part about studying ridiculously hard,btohqsg
But wdym stubborn nut in academic,btohqsg
Like study until burnt out ah,btohqsg
Yea but what happened to his acads,btohqsg
Coz i seriously was doing the same,btohqsg
Oh then it is q good ah,btohqsg
That means he has not burnt out yet which is good,btohqsg
i think it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what about his hyperfixation is very extra  but one of those things that you can probs tell irl that it’s not normal,btohqsg
Tbh it is a common trait among people on the spectrum,btohqsg
not just on the autism spectrum spectrum,btohqsg
some forms of ADHD has a similar trait,btohqsg
But for him to qualify and do well in uni means he is mild only,btohqsg
Did the dude enter by conditional criteria,btohqsg
On the other side of the spectrum there are ppl who cant even communicate,btohqsg
I didnt know u can enter jc w/o passing L1,btohqsg
idk man like iirc Ive read on seab site before if uw enter JC or smth,btohqsg
I got read up but I didn't know know that lol,btohqsg
But im serious he wun get above 4 when he burn out,btohqsg
I nearly burnt out 2 weeks before A levels,btohqsg
What do you think of a psychiatrist directly dismissing a patient who kinda thinks they have undiagnosed adhd,btohqsg
But that is already 2nd upper,btohqsg
But it is now on a downward trend?,btohqsg
Tbh my uni grades is a roller coaster,btohqsg
It is more inappropriate in my classmate’s case,btohqsg
mine is from reading and a few of my close friends that has diagnosed ADHD including my best friend,btohqsg
Idk what she told the cher but her main reason was,btohqsg
My friend told me about it coz i wqs absent,btohqsg
bro what does age have to do with this,btohqsg
she has hours that straight up is impossible for her to work. needs to time it with her aderall,btohqsg
bro I've seen 14 or 15 year olds act mature as fuck,btohqsg
yea but i don't think it's a good thing,btohqsg
uk ADHD researches are done mostly on guys instead of girls,btohqsg
age is just a number  it's not an indicator of how mature they are,btohqsg
girls who get diagnosed later are usually when they're adult,btohqsg
Like my friend who tells me he is breaking down every few days,btohqsg
why does double have the asian mindset 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭 😭,btohqsg
i mean just based on this it’s an asshole move bc they should check but ngl when it comes to neurodivergent conditions and mental health so many people try to self diagnose,btohqsg
And he thinks it makes me feel better by saying he thinks im better than him which is clearly not true lol,btohqsg
im just chilling in the pantry area and then all of a sudden,btohqsg
my body is telling me it's maybe 6,btohqsg
She fking bs me say oh your sch records should say or behavioural traits should show,btohqsg
funny enough my main two sources of info for this are both girls diagnosed as teens,btohqsg
Don't get me wrong it exists,btohqsg
anyway the inattentive adhd one is (i think) my best friend. and she’s the vet sch person so,btohqsg
I do stupid things when i was 17,btohqsg
she found a way to deal with it,btohqsg
Things that i still regret now,btohqsg
Idk if I'm on the spectrum thh,btohqsg
I feel like I am cause of my bro,btohqsg
if you look back at your teen years and don’t regret it means you haven’t outgrown any stupidity,btohqsg
i alr regret stuff i did in jh 🤡,btohqsg
i mean only in uni did i find out i have smth neurodivergent too,btohqsg
Idk why a 13y/o me let my friend use my ig acct to cyberbully n then me got into trouble w the principal instead,btohqsg
oh btw in y2 the boys were talking about it and i think one of the guys was saying the pw boy want to do stuff like that to me,btohqsg
looking into smth i thought was a me issue lol and then getting diagnosed,btohqsg
Well said  i should think of this whenever i start thinking about the past and start cursing myself,btohqsg
im saying you're that you're not the avg kid that acts stupid and retarded,btohqsg
the wokeness has woken up in atarax,btohqsg
Tbh there are a lot of undiagnosed mental health issues in sg coz people dun readily go to psychiatrist / psychologist,btohqsg
I hv this overthinking syndrome (not really a condition but apparently it is),btohqsg
What's messed up is your bitch radar,btohqsg
Like i cant work w someone i hate,btohqsg
i found a german word that describes you btw. unrelated to mental health ig,btohqsg
But i mean it is bopian  in work u cant choose ur colleagues,btohqsg
Kuro what happens if a girl clings onto you,btohqsg
A lot of ppl cant coz there is a bunch of idiots making my internship bad,btohqsg
you can talk to us next week,btohqsg
Like ostracising me coz they are smarter and blah blah,btohqsg
Uk the elite got 2 types,btohqsg
The toxic elites and the nice accommodating elites,btohqsg
Yes kuro i have heard you vent about ur grpmates,btohqsg
For me i think my classmates are pretty nice so idt pw shld hve many arguements,btohqsg
Im envious about all the nice nice classes,btohqsg
My cousin told my dad this girl in my class bully me,btohqsg
I didnt know it was so visible,btohqsg
Coz im the type who suffers in silence,btohqsg
Like i dun dare tell my parents if im bullied,btohqsg
those classes usually everyone have their own friend groups and not much class spirit,btohqsg
I hope my class isnt like that...,btohqsg
I freaking dun get why there was this girl in my class who always wanna find trouble w me,btohqsg
confirm got smth that stood out to them,btohqsg
like fr is either they stupid or you also were stupid,btohqsg
either you did something that unknowingly made them dislike you or she thinks you're an easy target to blame for her problems?,btohqsg
either way not your fault cause you also don't know what you did wrong ma,btohqsg
so is not like you can do anything,btohqsg
“look at this loser always on her notes. let’s mess with her bc funny”,btohqsg
But she also claimed that i btr chance of finishing my econs paper coz of extra time,btohqsg
Then she act shock shock when result come coz my results is easily accessible even if u dun sit next to me,btohqsg
Aiya she's jelly and projecting her views,btohqsg
What an insult for them to the same species as us,btohqsg
that’s me when you ask me about physics,btohqsg
run the first 2.3km in 7 mins then leopard crawl the last 100m,btohqsg
how bout i run 7min then i dont cross the line,btohqsg
i do jumping jacks until 8min29,btohqsg
or i run in the opposite direction and cross the finish line from the opposite,btohqsg
how bout i run 6 laps on the outermost lap,btohqsg
no  we do MOVE BACK SIR,btohqsg
Sing never gonna give u up,btohqsg
make sure to do the dance too,btohqsg
Idk man there's deffo more than one amos,btohqsg
That has one star but not me,btohqsg
You're deffo not  my batch one,btohqsg
Not unless your performance is shit,btohqsg
Or your superior is an ass,btohqsg
How long you on PTE rank?,btohqsg
Ask your nice friend who has e-hr access to check for you when your promotion LOL,btohqsg
You won't get CFC when you ORD,btohqsg
Nth much you can do with $20,btohqsg
Nigga as of now it's still starting w 1,btohqsg
U how many days to ord,btohqsg
Why u say I copium then,btohqsg
i dont even remember the date i orded,btohqsg
ok nvm i googled the date since i orded and holy fk im old,btohqsg
Drowning in the phy lab report?,btohqsg
Not as old as someone *coughs* iykwim,btohqsg
i have laid on my bed for more than 12 hours today,btohqsg
i took my free time to go for a photography course lmao,btohqsg
i would love to learn photography,btohqsg
you don't seem to take a break 💀💀💀 ngl,btohqsg
is it just a personality  trait or wot,btohqsg
i think you just assume that when i don't reply i'm working,btohqsg
I just go use my phone take wtv I like,btohqsg
I thinking of bringing my cam to sch tmr,btohqsg
I mean ig another assumption I've made is also you're not that onto social media cuz diff gen yk,btohqsg
tbh nowadays don't really need camera,btohqsg
i spend quite a bit of time just laying in bed watching youtube,btohqsg
even though im physics  i dont really understand focal length  lighting  frame and all that in depth stuff very well,btohqsg
so it would be nice to learn,btohqsg
How it looks to me when I take,btohqsg
i self learned some stuff in the past,btohqsg
I gonna learn from my friends tbh,btohqsg
I know q a few ppl in,btohqsg
you got drink the shit luwak coffee,btohqsg
i can't appreciate coffee so it was wasted on me and my friend,btohqsg
I took this when i was in korea,btohqsg
but thats just the depth of my skill level only lmao,btohqsg
feel like my nice pics are just bc the background is alr damn nice,btohqsg
honestly could post this on ig and come up with some cringey caption LOL,btohqsg
dang i would love to visit penang some day too,btohqsg
Went to penang for a sec 2 sch trip,btohqsg
oh ya i visited schrodinger's grave in austria,btohqsg
did you tell him HOW MUCH PAIN HE IS CAUSING ME NOW,btohqsg
we had to took like an off path to visit him,btohqsg
bc it was our grad trip to europe,btohqsg
like the amount of light that hits your camera...?,btohqsg
i learned that underexposing specific areas sometimes damn nice,btohqsg
bc it fleshes out the subject more,btohqsg
i just see the one roof LOL,btohqsg
idk y i decided to take at this angle,btohqsg
If yall wondering where santa is,btohqsg
Same kuro same I get u,btohqsg
i actually kinda like how this turned out,btohqsg
Kuro have you tot of going on a solo trip,btohqsg
I mean it kinda is but ig you're from there rite,btohqsg
Being dragged as in no choice ah,btohqsg
Tbh id have no opinion and never had a say but it's not like I mind ykwim,btohqsg
I just genuinely like visiting and appreciating such places overtime,btohqsg
It's just what's the pt if I spoke up,btohqsg
I go there to visit uk the deceased,btohqsg
Why does that sound so familiar,btohqsg
Is that side of your fam very idk very religious,btohqsg
And these kind are religion are meant to be individualistic btw,btohqsg
doing that is no diff to church,btohqsg
one part of it  not the main one,btohqsg
Gets had a friend exactly in your place,btohqsg
something about the way this pics colours are,btohqsg
Does it not give off a very unnatural cult vibe,btohqsg
That's what my friend went thru,btohqsg
Netherlands got red light district. perfect for kuro,btohqsg
tbh this place and like the north of finland kind of trip,btohqsg
legit is the couple honeymoon trip,btohqsg
i'm purposely not going there for now,btohqsg
he went to the santa claus village then got a 24/7 live stream from a camera there,btohqsg
Haha uk the chances of seeing north lights is so low,btohqsg
You see the so called forecasts of it and yet you might still miss it,btohqsg
But ya the shots not bad hor 😔😔😔,btohqsg
I may just stay back tmr just to join photog club friends take pics,btohqsg
Sturdy less run down I feel,btohqsg
I honestly can't be arsed w,btohqsg
Ive been joking w my friends,btohqsg
Eh time to dropout and just crochet all day,btohqsg
i've been saying that is time for me to drop out of ite since last year,btohqsg
i see my pri sch. but damn the clouds,btohqsg
i have a weird liking of suns,btohqsg
but my phone cnnt rly capture moon,btohqsg
ur samsung cam btr than mine,btohqsg
Kuro I fucking love how everyone sends background uk clouds and skies and you'd out of the blue send a deadass cny dragon deco,btohqsg
No cloud cover confirm that day v hot one,btohqsg
man i hiked up mt batur in bali at night to see the sunrise bc it's apparently beautiful af,btohqsg
and yk what we ended up seeing,btohqsg
My SS/geog maybe d7 but I'm just  d right one for u,btohqsg
mine js looks like one bright light,btohqsg
we started hiking at like after midnight LOL,btohqsg
the moon i take no texture no colour,btohqsg
Tht pic is the only good pic i hve of the moon,btohqsg
Go genting highland also can see,btohqsg
imagine hiking 1.7km i think expecting to see,btohqsg
that's the height btw not the distance,btohqsg
oh yea on top of the hike to see fog,btohqsg
i rolled my ankle climbing down,btohqsg
there's a vid somewhere of me borrowing someone's hiking stick to use as a cane LOL,btohqsg
it’d have been such a nice payoff sia for getting up there,btohqsg
in the end we got like some sandwiches in the cold,btohqsg
climbed our asses down wet from the rain into the car,btohqsg
Booked my tickets already  planning go tokyo  kyoto and osaka any recommendations hahaa,btohqsg
Coz it's just my friends (not in ns) wanted go japan LOL,btohqsg
I went there twice in the last 2 years,btohqsg
i traveled so much but that’s the one place i’ve never been to that i wanna,btohqsg
If you go Kyoto  don’t go arashimaya bamboo forest. Overrated,btohqsg
I rly miss my Japan trip now,btohqsg
For Osaka Umeda sky building escalators are cool. Teamlab also has some very nice displays. Also try to findshotengai (what they call those long shopping streets that are usually sheltered),btohqsg
Also right if you want to buy cheap food at department stores (especially the Isetan at Kyoto station)  go just 30 mins before closing. The food hall would have shops selling perishables between 10-50% off,btohqsg
Ah planning go nara deer park,btohqsg
I didn’t go sadly  but from what I saw from other’s ig stories it looks quite fun,btohqsg
Osaka’s aquarium also seems quite nice,btohqsg
Ahh yeah planning go there too,btohqsg
blanja random sge people to hdl,btohqsg
Thanks man! I'll see what I need and I'll drop you a msg,btohqsg
yes i use this to record trains,btohqsg
is better than a phone mic,btohqsg
I GO WHACK YOU WITH R151 BOGIE,btohqsg
if udm hiking abit. can go to minoh falls in Osaka. also go to osaka castle but dont bother paying to go inside (unless udm the queue if any) go to osaka museum of history  can see the castle and its surroundings.,btohqsg
yasia i go there see bamboo oni. boring,btohqsg
even the wifi reception damn rabz,btohqsg
i end up using my data,btohqsg
maybe because there's some sort of signal jammer near you,btohqsg
changi airport area that side damn rabz,btohqsg
my office last time also was impossible for starhub to connect,btohqsg
looks like my brain is finally working for once,btohqsg
my mother going out with her friend and her son is coming alongi dont like her son but my mom expects me to make small talkzen me ban,btohqsg
just try your best with talking to him,btohqsg
Oversleep  last min got illness  oh I have plans with friends already,btohqsg
If not just use gen z terms to communicate with him idk I'm too old to figure out how to talk to younger people😭,btohqsg
if only i was as lucky as u,btohqsg
Sometimes can see this acft when I'm I cookhouse through the fences,btohqsg
i used to see F16s  AEWs and UAVs take off everyday,btohqsg
data so shit map doesn't load 💀,btohqsg
oh wow it's at KL now,btohqsg
tbh i didn’t find teamlabs that fun when i was in tokyo,btohqsg
but i understand why people enjoy it,btohqsg
i camp at the shopping streets,btohqsg
I also didn’t go there lol  didn’t have time but one of my sec sch chers did and it looked good,btohqsg
But I regret not going to more countryside areas,btohqsg
Kanazawa was quite nice too. It’s a city but much less crowded than Kyoto or Osaka,btohqsg
I wanted to go to Tojinbo but parents don’t want,btohqsg
my mother is the kind of person that will drag me outside,btohqsg
well for me it did look good and all yeah but it was nothing much for me,btohqsg
I watch a lot of only in Japan John daub and the countryside looks amazing,btohqsg
the best places r the chrome hearts shops in harajuku>>>>>>,btohqsg
Ah ok I guess families with kids or ppl who like art will appreciate more,btohqsg
Like 21st century museum of contemporary art in Kanazawa would be more appreciated by artists than ppl like me,btohqsg
only thing i enjoyed about japan was like the chill lifestyle,btohqsg
like the streets looked good and etc,btohqsg
Idk what gen zs are talking these days😂,btohqsg
he prob doesnt like taylor swift,btohqsg
Ah yes cookhouse laksa made from killiney laksa paste but they sift out the oil,btohqsg
our schooling experiences are quite different,btohqsg
and he said like stuff that make me buay song before,btohqsg
so tbh idrw talk to him,btohqsg
ok yk what i see if he talk first,btohqsg
if he does then i entertain,btohqsg
I love maths and I want to stretch myself. I want to expand my maths knowledge and play with numbers so I can make more Math songs and poems. And most of all  I want to use these numbers to make movies and music or just for the fun of it and to inspire other girls to love Maths. The gender gap in STEM is disproportionately skewed towards guys so I want to shine that light and open the door for girls and women everywhere,btohqsg
god i skip too many tuitions,btohqsg
reminds me of my cdac tuition,btohqsg
just sumtimes too tired when sch ends at 1 and it starts from 4 to 7,btohqsg
also dam cb on the same day the guitar ensemble has their cca at the library,btohqsg
Why do you even sign up for them,btohqsg
great now my pld cant login to the acc ffs,btohqsg
Still probably won’t absorb as much as a live class,btohqsg
I kind of wish I can be like him but I doubt I’ll be able to assimilate well into Japanese society,btohqsg
some people can and prefer it,btohqsg
Yeah but unlike a zoom/physical class  you can’t interact with the tutor,btohqsg
If the video recording is to watch at one’s own pace  can rewatch it later,btohqsg
But should still join the live class,btohqsg
Also for subjects like math it would very important to attend the class live so that the tutor can help spot any mistakes you make  sometimes just watching a recorded video isn’t enough and you can’t tell where you went wrong,btohqsg
just somedays i may have other projects after sch and my brain is just cooked,btohqsg
not enuff focus for 2 classes,btohqsg
Guys he starting to yap about unhealthy foods already,btohqsg
jn i was saying my mother drag me out to meet her friend and her son is coming along  but i dont like himthen now he yapping about which foods are unhealthy,btohqsg
just nod your head every few moments,btohqsg
i dont even acknowledge him im just eating my own food,btohqsg
if he complain ltr just say i tried to talk to him but we dh anything to talk about,btohqsg
i hear him yap i want to 😴alr,btohqsg
his voice is very annoying 😭💀,btohqsg
Women actually get the same number of opportunities as guys  at least in SG,btohqsg
What subjects you attend tuition for tho,btohqsg
oh that's not my post it's a copypasta of what some other person said,btohqsg
If math should definitely try going for on site classes as much as you can,btohqsg
Maybe for humans subjects recorded video is more suitable,btohqsg
my sch with prerecorded math lectures 🤡,btohqsg
tbh i dont even watch the lectures,btohqsg
you can’t generalise this to everyone,btohqsg
Like I guess if you need individual attention in sch  you would need consults whereas with group tuition the classes should not be too large such that the tutor can still go around to ask if students have any doubts they can clarify. If your tutorial class is not too large your teacher might also be able to give you some attention,btohqsg
math live classes aren’t always useful either,btohqsg
this is wholly dependent on the tutor and how they go about it,btohqsg
That’s why I think it depends on the subjects. But in general live will be better for most,btohqsg
tbh yea i also don't understand large group tuitions because if you cant learn in a class group setting to the point that you need tuition what makes you think you can learn in a tuition group setting,btohqsg
no no im not saying online classes are better for me,btohqsg
just that sumtimes i too fatigued,btohqsg
whether someone prefers live or not is dependent on both the subjects and the person itself,btohqsg
what’s the point of attending if you aren’t gonna be able to focus on it,btohqsg
tho my phy/chem cher oso not thattt great,btohqsg
My math tuition centre tutor will always go around during class to help students with their work which is especially useful since I often get stuck doing qns and can’t tell where I went wrong even after looking at the suggested answer,btohqsg
gonna go jun weis one next time fr,btohqsg
So like if recorded video I will be super unproductive,btohqsg
Also right at home there will likely be more distractions,btohqsg
That’s why I would think making an effort to attend the class live itself then rewatching the recorded video later if need be is better,btohqsg
i think you’re projecting a bit,btohqsg
To each their own I guess,btohqsg
@kohsyanlast time my senpai was supposed to help me with math ended in 30min tea session about fcp and school admin,btohqsg
Only if like the student is so tired or if they’re unwell and they can’t absorb much then don’t go for live,btohqsg
Btw he is from drakon so i think he will be happy if i told him drakon won 2x in 2024,btohqsg
In sch have more distractions (eg. Fcp),btohqsg
a lot of people just can’t focus and absorb in live lessons,btohqsg
they don’t have to be unwell,btohqsg
Honestly for math  if for group tuition the Cher doesn’t even bother going around to let students clarify their doubts it’s likely a red flag,btohqsg
Math needs a lot of practice and on the spot feedback,btohqsg
Nvm I let the instrusive thoughts win,btohqsg
My sch h1 math only have tutorials 💀,btohqsg
RI every thing is prerecorded online lectures,btohqsg
ye sumtimes if i dont pre read got liddat,btohqsg
every1 thr shld be self driven enuff anyways,btohqsg
Idk i dont take h1 math,btohqsg
Lectures it’s so hard to get personalised help,btohqsg
Ngl history lectures are the only lectures I pay attention in,btohqsg
ye maybe putting it on too much of a pedestal lol,btohqsg
For h1 history everything was done in my tutorial class,btohqsg
So can easily ask the Cher questions,btohqsg
I find my a levels experience so weird,btohqsg
The subjects I hate I do well,btohqsg
The subjects I like end up being crappy,btohqsg
just feel like we cannot project our experiences with how we feel classes should be run onto everyone,btohqsg
find the way that works for you and run with it,btohqsg
Have you done other subj hw in pw/gp/cce before,btohqsg
for physics i usually just go through and finish the stuff then when i get far ahead enough,btohqsg
Well I’m sorry if I did appear to do it. But I’m quite sure based on what I’ve seen around me live classes  be it zoom or on site  appears to be favoured by most over pre recorded especially for non humans subjects. You won’t find most students just buying pre recorded videos from tuition centres and not attending any live classes.,btohqsg
