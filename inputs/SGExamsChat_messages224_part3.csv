even straits times  as an official news reporting site  and today wrote it as she yanno,btohqsg
"there is a possibility that the guy managing the account did that alleged ""mistake"" and is not representative of the views of MOE",btohqsg
^ and i dont think it wld be SUCH a big issue  if it didnt sound hypocriticalbut dont get me wrong yes  misgendering someone is bad enough as it is. Misgendering someone ON PURPOSE when u are clarifying about a situation like this is worse ukwim,btohqsg
like wouldnt he still be under moe,btohqsg
uh legally? based on what you learned  vicarious liability IF they get sued,btohqsg
common sense wise? people forget it within 3 days,btohqsg
and in a sense moe can be held for vicarious liability,btohqsg
very unlikely  because if MOE will be sued  there must be damages  and there is no damage here. Emotional hurt does not hold up in court,btohqsg
depending on jurisdiction  but singapore prima facie does not IIRC,btohqsg
cuz it caused further damage to her mental health and caused trauma,btohqsg
but could it be considered damage done tho? for not allowing her to go through the process,btohqsg
if its actually moe that did it,btohqsg
it depends if the court can establish that it is a big factor in causing damage to mental trauma  and there is no other substantial cause etc. it also has to be on a high degree of magnitude comparative to other cases etc.,btohqsg
but not very exactly sure for SG,btohqsg
you ah  mixing up your basic info sir  work harder be lawyer,btohqsg
so for damage caused to say that moe was negligent in duty of careit has to be a physical damage to play safe?,btohqsg
i dont even think there is a DOC in the first place,btohqsg
now that u said that mental health dh,btohqsg
cant even sue in the first place  much less win or lose,btohqsg
what the fuck didnt i ask to be addressed as fuckmaster69,btohqsg
Why this generation so sensitive call “him” also can die ah,btohqsg
"Not a good analogy. The term ""stupid"" is a subjective one. It could mean different things when asked to different people. It could mean doing smthg that defies common sense or having a low IQ(and what is considered low differs among people). But the pronoun 'he' refers to one being a male biologically and this is alr clearly defined by the scientific community so there shd be no debate on it.",btohqsg
one is gender and one is identity tho  like my gender is male  and there is no debate  but I can identify as fuckmasta69,btohqsg
i think the line gets blurry with trans because gender and identity is now intertwined,btohqsg
Exactly and so the message was only referring to the person's gender,btohqsg
I am very old alr (not a boomer). But i think like u haha,btohqsg
Bruhhh also people be simping for the chinese textbook characters lmaooo,btohqsg
also gen z: lmao i wanna die i wanna die i wanna die i wanna die,btohqsg
Nah those are Billie eilish fans,btohqsg
billie eilish : *breathes*14 year old girls : D E P R E S S I O N,btohqsg
"ok imagine you're a guy(u identify as one)  but everyone calls you a girl. you told them to STOP  countless of times  because you want to be called a guy. but even after everything you have done  they still called you a girl. now  you have a mental condition  but MOE decides to interfere with the treatment and says that no you can't do this. but all you want is for people to call you a GUY and not a GIRL  and MOE still doesn't allow you to go for hormonal treatment. Your school also doesn't allows you to go for these treatments because it could ""affect their reputation"". you are basically at wits end  because it stresses you out that you can't be identified as who you want others to call you. it's not really a sensitivity problem. why can't Singapore move forward and understand that these matters are quite important and in this case  detrimental to someone's mental health. how is SHE supposed to go to school and study in peace  knowing that so many people are going to misgender her  even if she told them not to?",btohqsg
"generally speaking   singapore policy making is very influenced by traditional ideas. how would you then take it into account? It is on a much larger scale than ""he/she/it/whatever"" pronoun game",btohqsg
Gender is strictly abt someone's biological identity,btohqsg
Don't confuse gender with sexual orientation,btohqsg
there are so many articles out there which explains about these misconceptions. do take some time read them.,btohqsg
you can choose not understand it. or maybe you just can't understand it. but the most basic way of approaching this problem is to respect their decisions. it's never up to anyone else to speak for these people.,btohqsg
if this is Singapore  does that mean we can't change? does that mean we have to move backwards instead of forward? does that mean these people don't deserve the BASIC RESPECT they deserve as humans?,btohqsg
i think it boils down to whether you want to respect them or not  calling what they want to be identified as won’t cause any harm to you  so why not just do it? Refusing to do so won’t make things any betteri strongly disagree about ‘neopronouns’ where people would literally make up their own pronouns  but if they want to be identified as those  why can’t we just respect them and do so?,btohqsg
May I ask if anyone here is studying computer engineering at local polytechnics?,btohqsg
Aiya at this point go run for office yourself already lah HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Go get a clipboard get some signatures and run for office yourself,btohqsg
Why Th is there such a huge debate over a simple pronoun,btohqsg
as singapore becomes more affluent  and bread and butter issues are less prevalent  inclusivity is now being more sought after,btohqsg
what the hell r u talking abt,btohqsg
get my pretty name out of your mouth,btohqsg
we are not the same  with or without,btohqsg
bc people above also refuse to acknowledge that gender pronouns of a person need not be the same as their biological genders?,btohqsg
Wait don’t argue yet  let me grab my popcorn first,btohqsg
Yeah next time all men can go female toilet and claim that they are female yah!,btohqsg
im referring to males who actl become females and are part of the transgender community,btohqsg
