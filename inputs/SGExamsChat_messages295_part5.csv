alot of people say 90% is a1,btohqsg
Not for this year I feel,btohqsg

it’s hard to get a1 bcs everyone takes emath so only the best of the best cn get,btohqsg
90% can’t be A1 this year,btohqsg

Surely not 95 la... distinction rate for math is about 55% leh. If A1 is 95  where got 55% score close to 95 lol,btohqsg
If 60% can still maintain b4,btohqsg

Guys shld I take triple science + elect geog or double science + pure geog and elect hist I have equal passion for both but I scared if my ss bad then my L1R5 will be affected if I take triple science and 1 human,btohqsg
depends on whether u can cope. humans more content-heavy. consider yr grade for science and humans to decide,btohqsg
As someone who took the latter i'd say its pretty managable. Just need consistency.,btohqsg
Either way you still need SS,btohqsg
Yes but L1R5 only need 1 humanities max,btohqsg
So I can use pure geog,btohqsg
