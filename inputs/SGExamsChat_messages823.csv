eg multi pages on Straits Times about 9/11,btohqsg

U should take those out in the MRT and casually read em,btohqsg
history > geog but i failed the sgjourney quiz that my mom ask me to do for her,btohqsg
when I was in NS in 2003  2 Malaysians robbed some place in Malaysia with a gun  and escaped via sea to Singapore,btohqsg
Of all places  they landed in Tekong,btohqsg
@urbanwhisperrSingapore armed forces ambulance with lights heading towards hougang ave 3,btohqsg
Is that the real source of SARs?,btohqsg
normal to see  not normal to see in everyday neighbourhood,btohqsg
🤣 the ocean did it to them,btohqsg
SARS originated in Hong Kong supposedly,btohqsg
One driver as well  no partner,btohqsg
My time was the time where Mas Selamat escaped the high security jail in SG and escaped to Malaysia,btohqsg
Unknown if there is occupant inside the back,btohqsg
I saw it drive pass lmfao,btohqsg

The only person in cabin was the driver,btohqsg
There was no sirens and it was def the armed forces one. Merc sprinter,btohqsg
U got see David Marshall before?,btohqsg
no  I only saw Chiam See Tong before in real life,btohqsg
white merc one or green combat one,btohqsg
Interesting fact 20 years before  the first batch of commandos nearly had to execute a hostage rescue in sg because a Malaysian plane was hijacked and it's destination was kallang airport,btohqsg
With one driver and nobody else?,btohqsg
1990s there's still Cheng San GRC,btohqsg

Wah but aggressive sia the driver,btohqsg
Trying to tread the middle between two cars at a stopped junction the moment light turn green,btohqsg
How many remember about Trans Island Bus Services,btohqsg

My JC junior  was the son of the founder,btohqsg
either reckless or actual fking emergency,btohqsg
Bro look so non chalantly somemore,btohqsg
Was it Carter or HW bush back then,btohqsg
I think Bush was the one in 2001 during 911 event,btohqsg
I talking about the older bush,btohqsg
earlier I also never go read about US presidents,btohqsg
Hw Clinton and a bit of bush,btohqsg
Would have been earlier for 01 if not for hanging chads,btohqsg
Oh nvm it was 10 years before,btohqsg
I feel like FM suits better than h3 maths,btohqsg
Esp cus h3 maths is move on proving,btohqsg
Kennedy was 61  Reagan was 81,btohqsg
Math definitely is very proof intensive this one I think we can agree,btohqsg
1995: The assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin came immediately after an anti-violence rally in support of the Oslo peace process.,btohqsg
Physics to some extent is also very intensive in terms of the proofing,btohqsg
CS depending on what modules you take,btohqsg
But you have to take discrete math,btohqsg
So it does help again to some extent,btohqsg
proof 1+1 = 1 using boolean algebra,btohqsg
You mean if al gore won Singapore’s 2001 election would’ve happened sooner?,btohqsg
Sorry I not referring to the Reagan here lol,btohqsg
Then i realised u meant ronald Reagan,btohqsg
I’m not sure about his children  got to read up more,btohqsg
Not rlly about who won its more of without the Florida issue which required the supreme court in Bush v Gore.,btohqsg
Eh sry what are you referring to when you said would have been earlier,btohqsg
Even tho it happened the same date the admin stuff was still backlog,btohqsg
Which might have actually contributed to the overlap that led to 9/11,btohqsg
Dk depends on which historian u ask,btohqsg
I thought it still happened on 20 Jan 2001?,btohqsg
Like it can’t be pushed forward anyway,btohqsg
No but it takes the US government like 3 months before to transition,btohqsg
Because u gotta nominate new secretaries,btohqsg
That's why almost all have a decision by late Oct the year before,btohqsg
All subj timed practice papers in mid july,btohqsg
Im like barely 30% for each subj,btohqsg
u studying for O levels or u studying for school exam?,btohqsg
I also dw go get egg even for practice lah,btohqsg
Dw that bochap attitude like my prelim eng oral friend get 16/30,btohqsg
I even asked him he not nervous he say this not even o lvl,btohqsg
I said if he flunk i laugh until no end,btohqsg
average student should get at least 18-19,btohqsg
I got 24 if i rmb correctlu,btohqsg
She said i saw wat others cldnt see  i too gud fr,btohqsg
It was a vid of kids playing didgeball liddat,btohqsg
Like they throw the ball under the person,btohqsg
The qn like are this important activities important for the youth or smth,btohqsg
Or like what value it provides,btohqsg
I cant rmb the specific word,btohqsg
Honestly if u check my search in here i probly talk about it,btohqsg
cuz u play professional dodgeball right,btohqsg
thats why so many things to say,btohqsg
So its good to let them destress like this,btohqsg
Oso got a qn abt like shld schs provide more opportunities for like grp competitions or smthhh,btohqsg
wah other than national sch games,btohqsg
Then i mentioned how sch need s to look at what benefits the student as a person and wat benefits them in getting to higher education,btohqsg
Like higher education normally want personal achievements,btohqsg
I made shit up on the spot ok,btohqsg
i would never thought of this,btohqsg
But grp achievements more practical cus in work environment is norm grp,btohqsg
"N like ""no man is an island""",btohqsg
Need to stick in a fancy quote,btohqsg
Actly do unis look more at individial achievements or grp achievements,btohqsg
Or thats just not very impt,btohqsg
is like just saying achievement unlocked,btohqsg
u just either need to qualify for them or ask,btohqsg
It was like shld schs emphasis more on grp stuff,btohqsg
but it depends on which kind of educational category u are looking into,btohqsg
obviously primary/secondary schools are putting more emphasis on achievements that can be put into portfolios showcasing a student's character and academics,btohqsg
Imo it's more if qualify then ask tbvh,btohqsg
No higher edu is called scholarship,btohqsg
can just ask around cause the curriculum now doesn't need a lot of qualifications before you are able to enquire unlike last time,btohqsg
Now there is a push to allow for that ig,btohqsg
idk much about pri school but last time there was a lot of random groups or personal opportunities outside of school houts,btohqsg
Just shifts it to a higher rejection rate tbh,btohqsg
even the overseas learning journeys and camps are limited spaces,btohqsg
last time it was mainly first come first serve,btohqsg
Based on the teacher telling who selectively,btohqsg
"So back then it was a ""qualify"" thing back then too",btohqsg
usually it depends on your teacher though,btohqsg
Na no matter the teacher the facts are that I am too retarded for anything,btohqsg
"some teachers they tell the whole class ""who want to sign up  go find XX YY""",btohqsg
it was only after 2020 then it started to lax a bit,btohqsg
but i chose to give no fucks about building my portfolio,btohqsg
< --- is a frequent absentee in sec sch,btohqsg
so bad that one of my upper sec form cher asked my mom to be prepared for me to retain N levels,btohqsg
My R4 was 32  R5 41,btohqsg
Might be able to afford caifan in 2040,btohqsg
ur r4 was 1  r5 was 2,btohqsg
Who tf can retain N levels,btohqsg
You literally need to not turn up for any exam to retain for N levels,btohqsg
don't ask me  ask one of my form cher in sec 3 and 4,btohqsg
Focus  commitment and sheer fucking will,btohqsg
I got asked to retain in Sec 3 also,btohqsg
I hate my secondary school so I elected not to,btohqsg
i turned up to all examinations for N levels in a wheelchair coz i just had a minor surgery due to fracture,btohqsg
I got a D7 or E8 in all subjects lmao,btohqsg
i nearly got expelled at the end of sec 2 due to truancy and shit grades but asked to be put in the NT class rather than the NA class i was in lower sec,btohqsg
The JAE form A they give me only had like 10 options lmao,btohqsg
props to my mom for pushing me everywhere during that period,btohqsg
and you qualify for how many options?,btohqsg
Like actually hit the points? Like 5 of em,btohqsg
it's just a matter of time,btohqsg
Cant relate sorry my psle starts with 1,btohqsg
N level legit no use one,btohqsg
Think about it. If u fuck it up u can go where?,btohqsg
I have completed the trinity of Singapore Education,btohqsg
oh you talking about if you fuck up,btohqsg
i was thinking in the other direction,btohqsg
Yeah I only left Nlevels to collect maybe I just private candidate 1 subject,btohqsg
Inflict as much emotional damage to all candidates as much as possible,btohqsg
N level math is a joke,btohqsg
I mean like worse case basis,btohqsg
Nah if you fail that idk how you even got into uni LOL,btohqsg
I got D7 for Olevel Emaths and always failed since then.,btohqsg
im clowning on the way math is marked in general,btohqsg
Its ok D7 for O level,btohqsg
what about N level A math,btohqsg
Tbh I should take History just to mess with the bellcurve,btohqsg
If I am paying I rather pay to make sure more Nlevel students die,btohqsg
Ok i wouldnt know tbh i didnt take A math,btohqsg
I dont remember much of anything other than calculus,btohqsg
is like asking for a death wish,btohqsg
Ah I see you are a dumbass as well,btohqsg
i feel like i got exam anxiety fr,btohqsg
I have the maths skills of a 10 year old,btohqsg
Isn't bedok retaking again? Or he ORD lo,btohqsg
he showed me his entry proof,btohqsg
i have a picture of it,btohqsg
Talk to me when you failed psle math,btohqsg
If u did u won't be here,btohqsg
i read this and i understand the chinese phrase but translating into english is like cursing knnccb in a setting related to education,btohqsg
meanwhile physics degree holder but E in H2 math,btohqsg
Thats why i went into NA,btohqsg
I got S in H1 maths,btohqsg
so ur better in explanations right,btohqsg
wah bro idk how to even explain physics questions,btohqsg
u sound like a chem or bio person,btohqsg
everyime the lines come out for paper 2 and 3 idk what to say,btohqsg
i mean last time ba  but now i need to be good at both to link my complicated math to the physical systems,btohqsg
Doesn't matter tbh we are the gang that shows the SEAB exam system is as accurate as astrology,btohqsg
How do you see a pile of math,btohqsg
Like all my soul is sucked out of me,btohqsg
that endearment of a nickname gives me ptsd,btohqsg
junwei is like the bible of o and a level,btohqsg
But you are existing. If you are indeed nothing then by definition you would be something as the nothing implies the presence of a lack of something,btohqsg
i just chip in time and again,btohqsg
but it's rlly smth to slowly comb over term by term  expression by expression,btohqsg
no wonder your luck is so shit sometimes,btohqsg
Answering o level physics qns made me doubt myself a whole ton of times,btohqsg
"""what does it mean physically to integrate this over this""",btohqsg
A good is still a good even if it is for nothing. Nothing accords a reason of null for now  but existence itself is a good making it oxymoronic,btohqsg
go take the sour fruit lor,btohqsg
If i wanna teach i probably really need to brush up on like the accurateness of what i know,btohqsg
i think my life is meant to be like that,btohqsg
Which is why I would probably fail Nlevel maths ngl,btohqsg
are you an atheist or something,btohqsg
Being able to articulate your working is another,btohqsg
why are you saying god bless,btohqsg
Anyone can just give the ans and workings tbh,btohqsg
I could probably get method marks la,btohqsg
But would just continue writing assuming the question can't be that easy,btohqsg
Like people ask in the group for the understanding and sometimes i feel i dont understand it well enough as a whole to answer their question even though i know the answer,btohqsg
i like teaching but i'll probs stick to teaching undergrads where possible,btohqsg
As a physics undergraduate trying to answer o levels,btohqsg
even tho i could probs earn quite a bit from tuition,btohqsg
God is Dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. Yet his shadow still looms. How shall we comfort ourselves  the murderers of all murderers?,btohqsg
i bullshitted my PSLE papers in 2019 with my understanding of psychology and got 170+ into NA stream,btohqsg
nah he legit had no confidence in me,btohqsg
As a uni student I learnt the art of not understanding what the fuck I am learning,btohqsg
tbh sometimes it's not that simple bc in sec sch  we neglect a lot of understanding fr,btohqsg
trying to understand details now when you have uni knowledge,btohqsg
is a pain in the ass,btohqsg
I remember asking why some thing are as such,btohqsg
I just got told because the formula said so,btohqsg
if you think that it's embarrassing,btohqsg
just don't think of it in such a manner,btohqsg
cause sometimes you get the concept,btohqsg
can teach but cannot do in exam,btohqsg
Just point to the -b +/-sqr b²-4ac/2a,btohqsg
i mean questions that come to mind that seem very simple would be anything to do with electricity and magnetism,btohqsg
Just say that as if it's so intuitive,btohqsg
I meant teaching o level ppl haha,btohqsg
i mean question like where do magnetic fields come from,btohqsg
I have the concept and the answers,btohqsg
But i dont know how to convey them in a way people will understand,btohqsg
tbh that's my worry about coming sem,btohqsg
And i kinda wanna pursue teaching be it private or moe so its something i need to work on,btohqsg
Its ok i will be brutal for you,btohqsg
I now understand Newton's experiments and why his law in Optics works,btohqsg
is it induced current or induced magnetic force i also confused,btohqsg
i'm gonna ask the undergrads to as much as possible  send me questions ahead of time if you wanna look for me LOL,btohqsg
so i got time to think about it,btohqsg
i'm not good at on the spot answering,btohqsg
Thats actually so much more appreciated,btohqsg
Ok Si Yan I have a question?Do you like Lestin? Do you like me?,btohqsg
Like sometimes i shun consultation because i only have 1 or 2 qns,btohqsg
And it feels like wasting the person's time,btohqsg
But if i can amass a whole pile of qns before meeting you,btohqsg
its a diploma two years then teach pri sch for 3 years,btohqsg
Just shoot during office hours or after lecture,btohqsg
@iestinu can try applying if u wan head into teaching,btohqsg
degree can teach up to sec,btohqsg
Hehe i cant deal with kids,btohqsg
best odds for you is try for PGDE,btohqsg
At this rate my gpa is going,btohqsg
pgde and diped is the same application,btohqsg
just tht one is diploma one is postgraduate,btohqsg
U need to teach at least 2 subjects or smth I remembered asking my ex teacher before,btohqsg
yea but it's not useful for him for another 2 years,btohqsg
But i dont think it really matters to me where i teach i just wanna teach,btohqsg
as in he's not done with his degree yet,btohqsg
as long as u in uni,btohqsg
After that PDGE need to start with a contract teaching stint anyways,btohqsg
issue is idt his gpa is high enough,btohqsg
I'm going for diped first before pursuing degree in Chinese studies,btohqsg
PGDE is just insanely competitive that you're just auto out if your gpa isn't there,btohqsg
I heard to be even considered you need 2nd upper,btohqsg
Yeah the minimum is SCH I think,btohqsg
I probably need a 5.5 gpa every sem from now on to reach 2nd upper by the end of 4 years,btohqsg
Chinese teachers are rare in SG(?),btohqsg
ye most of them from china,btohqsg
Give Si Yan your TA your very best,btohqsg
but the good thing is you're not as locked into teaching since your degree can do other stuff,btohqsg
That's honestly the good thing about STEM,btohqsg
All I can do with mine is toliet paper,btohqsg
I dont have much ambition in life so,btohqsg
Something to get by is good enough,btohqsg
I don't wanna survive I WANNA LIVE!,btohqsg
one of my friends didn't do well enough for A levels to do B.Ed so she did DipEd then try to have a high enough GPA to like upgrade to Bachelors,btohqsg
tbh idk if she made it,btohqsg
smth to give you money so you can do other things,btohqsg
People to do what they hate for money to use the money to do what they love,btohqsg
anyway same set of responsibilities so pay shld be the same,btohqsg
sounds like a Jimmy yang line,btohqsg
Isn't it the same applicant pool,btohqsg
Imo I find the degree for education very restricted,btohqsg
U legit cannot branch out at all,btohqsg
I see youre a man of culture,btohqsg
i was thinking the exact same line,btohqsg
i mean that's the thing lor. benefit of going degree directly is you can teach higher level and is secured. dip means it's a shorter programme but if you wanna do degree there's additional requirements,btohqsg
but my that friend likes to teach music so not like her options were many to begin with,btohqsg
I mean like NIE in general,btohqsg
Even for music conservatory get a degree in music can still be used for a career in orchestra,btohqsg
a lot of people that do the degree legit do it so they can jump to private tuition once their MOE contract ends,btohqsg
she doesn't wanna be a performer  she wants to teach,btohqsg
Then can claim ex moe blablabla,btohqsg
Call me maybe ... not?Many under 40 say they prefer texting over phone calls. Some even say cold calls trigger a deep fear that something is wrong. A journalism lecturer explains why phone call phobia  if you have it  could affect your career:https://cna.asia/3LbSC1nDo you struggle with phone call anxiety?,btohqsg
Yala basically that's my point lor it's for teaching is strictly that,btohqsg
how long does moe contracts ususally last,btohqsg
anyway if you compare degree in education for the subject vs the actual subject major  music is as far as you'd get,btohqsg
there's really no relation between the two,btohqsg
I am so traumatised after coming to smu,btohqsg
Ya basically yes my point is even in STEM or humanities is far away,btohqsg
U can't even branch into academia other than education academia,btohqsg
It's like a subset within a subset for Academia,btohqsg
"""PM  I ___ your hairstyle. But you know what is more concerning that your hairstyle  decline birthrate""",btohqsg
The daringness that they just said that to the PM omg,btohqsg
My dear you are ugly  but tomorrow I shall be sober and you will still be ugly.,btohqsg
I forgot if he siad like or hate but like,btohqsg
I remember that being a question for a forum for Chee Hong Tat as well back a while ago,btohqsg
He said something to the effect of the end of this conference yall can mingle around and increase it personally,btohqsg
All of us concerned about their hairstyles,btohqsg
Also a fly landed on his hair,btohqsg
I pity him sia. Man trying to listen to other people. In the end kena flamed,btohqsg
wah u can rmb the details so well,btohqsg
The grp in front of me was laughing,btohqsg
I took a while to realise,btohqsg

Oh they were pretty much removed,btohqsg
End up first 4 speaker per mic got ask the qns,btohqsg
Yeah if u really wanna ask u do so before or after at the food session,btohqsg

Aiya sad but nearby got a lot of options cuz CBD,btohqsg
Legit eh a lot of ppl had to go back to their seats,btohqsg
I dun get it also. The idea that the PM will have answers to everything as the highest man,btohqsg
"""PM  can give me food thx""",btohqsg
I didn't get the email tho confirm it's a STEM thing one,btohqsg
Either that or I just didn't qualify welps,btohqsg

i can be a reporter at lianhe zaobao or shin min daily news,btohqsg
when feminists becomes......  cfm plus chop got ppl resist their views?,btohqsg
when feminism turns people into feminists  there will certainly be people who counter their advocations,btohqsg
cos the literal translation is too long,btohqsg
女拳 isn't wrong for referring to female boxers,btohqsg
but i think got better terminology for that,btohqsg
I think the chinese also quite poor  cuz 提倡 what,btohqsg
this one is not called standardized chinese,btohqsg
fair enough singaporeans chinese is ass,btohqsg
singaporean chinese is probably the most oversimplified version of chinese out there,btohqsg
i speak to malaysian chinese  taiwanese chinese with my so-called singaporean chinese they don't understand what im trying to put across,btohqsg
I talk to the Viet ppl they alw try to speak english like american/british/australian,btohqsg
but malaysian the english still okok can understand,btohqsg
My friend who is a nerd in chinese agrees with that wholeheartedly,btohqsg
She went to taiwan to further her education in chinese,btohqsg
Discovers singapore's way of learning and teaching chinese is too damn ass,btohqsg
Actually i like the taiwan accent,btohqsg
We dont focus on the motivation of learning the language,btohqsg
We just learn it to solve 理解问答,btohqsg
i talk to ppl online they call the kind of english i use ( singaporean english which i never reveal ) more posh than most english users out there,btohqsg
like they don't even understand 75% of the things i try to ask,btohqsg
i learnt to lurk from henceforth,btohqsg
You are the devil from the heaven 🎼,btohqsg

Been stuck on qn for 30 mina,btohqsg
Barely did shit but time go lepak,btohqsg
The Left-Hand Warlord appointed a faux Inspector of the then Yu(zhou) Province and managed to besiege the county ( which was the under the rightful appointed Inspector of Yu Province  Sun Jian ); Gai Wenming made use of the critical situation turning it into an opportunity as the loyal minister had a difficult time establishing power ( during tumultuous times ). A great man comes first before making great deeds come next  followed by meritocratic achievements and contributions. What is extraordinarily made by man would indeed then be what others would foresee.为袁绍檄豫州 - Yuan Shao's Letter to Yunzhou,btohqsg

im just wondering if dialogue/forum sessions with a Minister of Parliament as the guest speaker can be counted in your portfolio or something,btohqsg
