Yah sia.This the dilemma I‚Äôm in now.If I top up GPMC $5k with Absolute  that‚Äôs just a temporary solution.Then apply Amex TCB and cancel UOB Absolute might be the next thing I‚Äôll do.But if Amex tcb nerf grab top ups  gg liao.Maybe just apply Citi Cashback+ 1.5% MasterCard . I think no min spend. But suck thumb coz can‚Äôt use this for grab top ups. Won‚Äôt matter already by then coz the rewards to top up grab nerfed so might as well just pay income tax  HDB  insurance as per normal,btohqsg
Somehow that reveals your age group lol,btohqsg
Hmm Citi Cashback plus Master can use pay insurance to earn points?,btohqsg
UOB Absolute Cashback Card: W.e.f 15 January 2023  the cashback rate awarded for Grab mobile wallet top-up transactions will be revised to 0.3%. To find out more about the change  visit UOB Absolute Cashback Card website.,btohqsg
i just got this SMS from UOB,btohqsg
Aiya I too late. Yesterday got Capita star 15% on grab app redemption,btohqsg
This is the worst nerf ever... But I guess I have no choice when I want to top up grab pay...,btohqsg
üëç can't we report to get it closed - it's so blatant fake and still using your face to scam people,btohqsg
Yesterday there was a Kevin learns investing scam chat,btohqsg
haiz  you can probably consider BOC zodiac card as well  1.6% cashback just like citi cashback+,btohqsg
But hor ladies n gentlemen I rethink again.If I have $5k  I not sure if it‚Äôs wise to top up GPMC before the nerf or should I just keep that $5k in SSB/cash funds  higher yield savings accounts that easily earn 3-5% now which is way more rebates than that measly 1.7% from UOB Absolute to Grab.Another perspective.,btohqsg
Need more people to report. Kelvin's one more jialat he not on Telegram to defend himself,btohqsg
That's what happened to me. I applied uob absolute and got nerfed withing 2 weeks.,btohqsg
Haha üòÜüòÜ but it expected look at all the nerf recently it just matter if Time,btohqsg
That's why I apply other as backup,btohqsg
This deserved a video.Ie for those of us who already have a favourite card but want a backup credit card to mop up misc spending above quota and without minimum spend (and annual fees if possible).I only know CIMB cards no annual fees and trust Bank cards,btohqsg
I guess I shouldn't apply for tcb. If not amex will Nerf everyone again,btohqsg
Agreed. Grab goes down  and bring everyone along with it. All good things come to an end eventually.,btohqsg
I am just worried the amaze+ Citi combo get nerfed,btohqsg
I saw online that annual fee waiver for CRMC is 'N/A while other cards have a 'tick''  does it mean we cant call in to waive the fee after the first year?,btohqsg
Enjoy the double triple dip while last,btohqsg
Probably no annual fee evenSome banks like CIMB  Trust have cards that don‚Äôt have annual fee forever,btohqsg
just checking here first  because a lot of yall using this card for v long alr,btohqsg
Now I‚Äôm just wondering‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point of having UOB Absolute even since converting it to MasterCard using Grab only gets me 0.3%. No one will top up Grab le. Final nail in the coffin.,btohqsg
Amex TCB 1.5% + Grab is the only alternative. But we too don‚Äôt know how long this will last.,btohqsg
From my own research  seem like as long as one spends about $6k on UOB Absolute in a year  they will waive the annual fee of $192.60,btohqsg
It seems like the cashback game is getting tougher by the day,btohqsg
Don't worry about annual fees that have not been charged.,btohqsg
Lol. Same here. Just got my card yesterdayüò≠,btohqsg
The banks are showing us who‚Äôs boss and keeping all of us back in line. End of the day we end up just spending on their cards as they intend us to.,btohqsg
Cannot canceled within 6mths or else kena penalty fee right?,btohqsg
Uob absolute still have their advantage like hospital bills and i also use it for service or purchase of ecapitavoucher when there is promotion that is open for any catd,btohqsg
Not that I need hospital services at this moment.,btohqsg
But anyway uob will see usage drop after the nerf that is for sure,btohqsg
Education also count and other gov service,btohqsg
someone mentioned of citi casback plus do accept insurance payment to earn points ?,btohqsg
now capita star app got 10% bonus for every $100 bought with DBS/POSB credit/debit card. Min $100 per top up up to 5x. i.e. total $100 x 5 over 5 days earns u $50 bonus.,btohqsg
Ya i share that day ago,btohqsg
Sometime they dont limit what card so i use uob amex to get 1.7 percent. Dbs dont give rebate or point for evoucher purchase,btohqsg
right now i'm  tryign to find use case for UOB Absolute... it's purpose is to fund GPMC for payments that were otherwise non-eligible for credit card rewards. I mean we can still top up GPMC  and earn 0.3% vs not earning anything at all.,btohqsg
usually if u cancel after 6 mths  there's no penalty fee and technically shouldn't affect credit score.,btohqsg
to sign up as new customer  some banks typically require that u had not owned any cards for previous 1 yr also.,btohqsg
supplmentary card user dont count as a old user of bank i suppose,btohqsg
Looks like it‚Äôs time to get amex tcb card,btohqsg
dont cry later kanna nerf and say omg i just got the card and it got nerfed,btohqsg
i use UOB Absolute for CapitaStar eVoucher purchase during their promos. This card practically gets us 1.7% on most things that are normally excluded by other cards which is the pull of the card.,btohqsg
be mentally prepared AMEX don't nerf grab top-Ups,btohqsg
buy voucher most card dont earn points?,btohqsg
most cards dont count buying vouchers as eligible spending to meet their quota. It's coz the MCC code that the voucher is under is excluded. So u need to test if unsure.,btohqsg
Yup for other card  only amex capita card  uob amex and amex truecashback give rebate for ecapitavoucher purchase,btohqsg
oh so amex till got its perks,btohqsg
but if use other cards for the purchase  will be random rewards given ranging from $0.10 to $10 right ?Because for DBS card its confirm fixed $10 additional up till 5 times,btohqsg
wonder if we buy topup card like itunes card will uob one earn ppints ?,btohqsg
in terms of 'limitless cashback' (thats what UOB terms it)  UOB Absolute earns u 1.7% on most things that are excluded.But now  they nerfed Grab top-ups so this means AMEX TCB 1.5% has the most liberal cashback since it had not yet nerfed Grab Top-ups,btohqsg
i dont think so.UOB ONE i tested only counts NTUC Physical Vouchers purchase as eligible spend. ie. u go NTUC buy from the aunty that type. I use this method when i need to hit quota,btohqsg
hmm so u suggest i buy ntuc voucher from ntuc use uob one to earn points then use ntuc voucher buy itunes card?,btohqsg
if u not sure  the best way to test is to buy small amount  then wait for the purchase to be posted on your card  call the bank n ask them is the MCC code for that purchase count towards eligible spend.,btohqsg
or i use amex buy captialmall voucher and and use capitalmall voucher to buy itunes card haha,btohqsg
huh? NTUC voucher is to buy groceries at NTUC bro,btohqsg
ntuc got sell top up cards i recall,btohqsg
wait i share with u 2 method,btohqsg
safer is i use amex hoot capitalmall voucher and hoot using captialmall voucher buy topup card like itunes,btohqsg
seem like most cc dont earn points if u use to pay for subscription to itunes or googlle play,btohqsg
1) If u buy NTUC physical voucher using UOB ONE  that earns u base 3.33% rebate on the card. Then u indirectly use that voucher to buy your iTunes card. But it's best to buy a cheap iTunes card then pay for it using UOB ONE then call up UOB to see if that is eligible spend or not. If it is then u can buy directly mah  if not then u need to buy NTUC voucher then use voucher buy iTunes.2) next is to use UOB Absolute to buy capitaMall eVoucher. U get 1.7% rebate for the purchase then u can use capitalmal eVoucher to buy anything for participating merchants.but test with option 1 since that earns u higher rebates.,btohqsg
no harm try try get a cheap itune,btohqsg
the option 2 is more or less proven,btohqsg
really meh? i tot subscription is counted as eligible spend?e.g. netflix  spotify  etcshouldn't things purchased on iTunes and Google Play be counted as eligible spend since these are retail purchases?,btohqsg
Just received this:UOB Absolute Cashback Card: W.e.f 15 January 2023  the cashback rate awarded for Grab mobile wallet top-up transactions will be revised to 0.3%. To find out more about the change  visit UOB Absolute Cashback Card website.,btohqsg
Time to move back to AMEX TCB Card for grab top up,btohqsg
Is this consider online Spend for DBS Live Fresh Card?,btohqsg
scb smart didnt state purchase or use to top up for itunes to be able to earn point but its only say netflix example,btohqsg
i only use option 1 when there's promotion.e.g. usually xmas promotion CapitalMall have top-up promo. Last year was every $100 top up gets 10% bonus eVoucher with any credit card. So if u use UOB Absolute 1.7%  effectively  topping up $100 gets u $17 bonus.,btohqsg

challenger should accept caplitalmall  E voucher i recall,btohqsg
voucher purchases do not count as eligible spending on most credit cards. U need to call the bank to check. Or test out by purchasing a small amount then call bank to check the MCC code.UOB Absolute 1.7% is special as it is marketed as 'limitless cashback' and can earn cashback on categories normally excluded by other cards such as insurance  hospital bills  etc,btohqsg
Oh so many people posted already,btohqsg
the community now on FIRE leAll trying to find alternative methodsSome just signed up UOB Absolute then now nerfed,btohqsg
Hmm what‚Äôs the best alternative method ? Amex true cash back card ?,btohqsg
ya next best before it get nerf,btohqsg
direct replacement is AMEX TCB 1.5%but be prepared AMEX might nerf Grab Top Upsbe prepared AXS might remove Grab paymentsAlso  sign up promo for AMEX 3% EXCLUDES GRAB top-ups.'be prepared' means not yet nerfed but who knows when,btohqsg
Imagine both axs and amex nerf grab  then grab would close door already.,btohqsg
Gg time to drop grab out of the equation,btohqsg
If one of the amex Singapore management see your post will probably take your suggestion üòÇ,btohqsg
correct.now i don't even know how to maintain Platinum status on grabneed 4500 points every 6 mths to extend further 6 mths,btohqsg
Also  Amex True Cashback is still ok for 1.5% Cashback on Grabpay Wallet (FOR NOW)Sign up at AMEX True Cashbackhttps://hmsg.link/amextcb,btohqsg
yes TCB can top up Grab to earn 1.5%,btohqsg
but the promo excludes grab Top ups,btohqsg
Are there any cards that works without grab for bill payments? Cashback or miles are fine,btohqsg
What is the best promo for Amex TCB card signup pls,btohqsg
what type of bills?UOB One credit card counts handphone bills  internet  Singapore power and electricity provider  spotify  netflix  etc as eligible,btohqsg
Oh yea essentially those  primarily utilities (and annual insurance and tax but I think can use citi payall for those),btohqsg
insurance and tax are excluded - not eligible,btohqsg
@oaksticoh citi can pay for recurring insurance ?,btohqsg
Sucks that amex isn‚Äôt as widely accepted in SG,btohqsg
I remember reading that insurance was eligible yea,btohqsg
amex not targeted for peasants i think,btohqsg
Actually i feel its quite widely accepted already. Esp compared to like indonesia  malaysia.,btohqsg
So far  I see most of you are in Group 2  which is a good sign.,btohqsg
need to use citi pay? or just setup any citi card for it?,btohqsg
But thanks for the suggestion  looks like I should cancel uob absolute and move to uob one,btohqsg
Most shopping mall shops now all accepts amex,btohqsg
Samsung pay just deleted off my Grab card as payment.... haiz,btohqsg
Not sure if any special action needs to be done  it was just there in the citi app and ibanking page,btohqsg
Use their grab payment damn troublesome. Too many clicks to enter...,btohqsg
check for cancellation fees if less than 6 mths. check if will affect credit score,btohqsg
But I feel like boycotting grab card now  since they withdraw our final straw ü§£,btohqsg
They're not dumb lah. The retention officer used Grab top ups as a way to try and retain me when I cancelled my card. They know we're using the card for grabpay top ups. Tbh as long as Grab is paying Amex  I don't think Amex care.,btohqsg
Wow uob one‚Äôs criteria‚Äôs kinda confusing,btohqsg
citi app ah hmm need to pay some small fee but never say how much,btohqsg
Citi Pay All is something like Card Up.it allows u to pay for insurance  tax etc that would other wise not be eligible but it charges u i think 2%.so just like card up  if your base credit card doesn't give u high enough a rebate  paying 2% to convert non-eligible to eligible spend is not worth it. Works with some citi cards only.https://www1.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/other-services/payall,btohqsg
2% kinda high vs 1.6 on the citi Casback plus,btohqsg
OMG this was fast oops this is the old mews,btohqsg
Milelion post in 13 aug 2022,btohqsg
idk if the sign up 3% bonus now still can top up Grab or not. but i dont think so,btohqsg
thought amex TCB so fast throw the towel,btohqsg
Tcb. For simplygo Standard charted's smart credit card is good,btohqsg
i recall its no more for new user only the exisiting user enjoyt it,btohqsg
But they are aware of it and that's even more frightening.,btohqsg
Wahahah! Now we need to strategy instead of amex grab method,btohqsg
UOB One is giving 8.33% for simplyGo.10% if u hit their 2k/mth tier,btohqsg
AMEX to Grab is i think will still be here albeit reduced rebates.Using this method to pay my bills last time can buy me chai fan.Now can buy me Kopi O Kosong small cup at neighbourhood kopitiam,btohqsg
ya that why i swtich to uob one from SCB smart,btohqsg

UOB ONE card is still my preferred card since i'm for cashback n not miles,btohqsg
But the tier is damn complicated.,btohqsg
i got used to it. kinda of an expert using this card le lol,btohqsg
the app will show u meet  the req,btohqsg
yeah  i use buy now pay later to help spread out the quota over several months also,btohqsg
are you referring to the credit card 1 or the UOB one savings account?,btohqsg
Maybe can get UOB Evol card? Req $600 spending? Less troublesome and less tracking?,btohqsg
i feel evol harder to meet,btohqsg

speclfic catagory to meetuob one more all rounder,btohqsg
At least not immediate effect... Lot of BS nerf recently is immediate effect,btohqsg
in addition  for wedding venue  i ask hotel split the cost into 12 months instalment n charge it to my card. All counted as eligible spend . Hotel happy  i happy,btohqsg
It will be legendary if Grabcard changes from masters card to AMEX,btohqsg
Evol got category cap   headache coz now need to figure out which spend fall into which category.uob one simpler  just meet quota.,btohqsg
agreed and 100$$ less just 500,btohqsg
AMEX wont approve.If i'm amex that is.,btohqsg
now im thinking citi pay need pay extra %% to useduno what else card to use to pay recurring insuance premiumsince amex only allow on AIA for 1st payment and subsiquent is not allow,btohqsg
Get ready for more nerfs again lolhttps://www.todayonline.com/singapore/grab-cut-travel-budget-freeze-most-hiring-and-salaries-senior-managers-ceo-calls-frugal-and-prudent-mindset-2072446,btohqsg
all over tech layoff like shopeee,btohqsg
Grab i feel is in a slippery slope. A death spiral.stock price dropping.Interest rates rising means they cant borrow as easilythey cut cost to reduce operational cost and reduced rewards to stop bleeding but this hurts their bottom line as they are effectively only relying on Grab Ecosystem Fans to sustain.,btohqsg
oh so qiao  just as i mention  u post this,btohqsg
killing the hen laying the egg,btohqsg
Grab better pray pray that amex don't nerf them. Or else this will be a final nail to the coffin.,btohqsg
that's why my grabpoints now i thinking how to offload it.need exit strategy from grab ecosystem.,btohqsg
this is not the final nail on the coffin.the final one is when they....Nerf grab points conversion.now 500 pts = $1if they nerf like 1000 pts = $1 then that's really the end,btohqsg
Taking into consideration the progression of Uber when it was still here I'd say Grab has managed to outlive that. With a lot more users reliant on the platform that has expanded into things more than ride hailing it also means that their fall would be even greater,btohqsg
Use for flashdeal or direct offset from purchase,btohqsg
they already made point accumulation so difficult last time was $1 = 10 ptsthen nerf become $1 = 6 pts,btohqsg
Think they can overturn losses to profit. But at a cost of consumer of course. Previously too ÂÖßÊç≤„ÄÇall fight for market share without thinking profitability.,btohqsg
Coz cheap money everywhere  now borrowing cost is increasing,btohqsg
the way i earn grab points now is unorthodox.Using SP app that give 2500 pointsusing Tiger Broker app that earn 4x 1000 pointstotal 6500 points,btohqsg
But it has the least exclusion,btohqsg
Samsung Pay just removed my Grab card. Even Friz card outlasted Grab inside my Samsung Pay wallet lol,btohqsg
grab also remove top ups to services like youtrip etc,btohqsg
But still the best card top up to grab if needed,btohqsg
grabpay mastercard still serves to convert amex to mastercard,btohqsg
anyone know if can use Grabpaymaster card to top up EZLINK?,btohqsg
Stock price dun affect biz. Biz affect stock price,btohqsg
Should we just wait until next year and see any new cards promo? Hahaha!,btohqsg
I personally use grabcar even if it's 50% more ex than cdg.Cos grabcar at least wait for u for 3mins. Cdg will just leave. They have no penalty.I had to cancel 1 of my appt because of that. I rather pay more  when I am in a hurry to cfm I have a ride.,btohqsg

i wait until i got things to buy then i sign up new card,btohqsg
this my use case for grab. i still take Grab Taxi occasionally. Heng i use UOB ONE then get 10% rebate.,btohqsg
B4 Jan 15. Top up more into grab wallet,btohqsg
$5000 top up using AMEX UOB Absolute 1.7% = $85$5000 put in higher yield savings account/cash funds etc lets say conservative 3% earns $150/yr or $75 in 6mths.So depending on how fast u use the $5k that u toped up  it might be better for us to let our cash earn passive income.,btohqsg
besides once u top up 5k in Grab  it sits in the wallet like a lazy bum bum not earning any interest,btohqsg
I see you watch Kelvin's content,btohqsg
for those of u who are following the news on the federal reserve fed funds rate  u know they will continue to hike rates till at least mid 2023. Which means that the banks might do another rate increase  ssb might go up  t bills might go up etc. So locking up $5k in Grab while all these happening is like opportunity cost lsot,btohqsg
Mean u need to pay credit card interest for 6 mnth,btohqsg
bro  i'm talking about bank interest rates,btohqsg
not credit card fee interest rate,btohqsg
U say top up using uob absolute,btohqsg
if top up then i get 1.7% of $5K THATS $85 rebate. 1 time.then the 5k sit in my grab account not earnign any interest i mean,btohqsg
If u spend within 2 month or what then still ok.,btohqsg
But u pay the bill next mnth. So if u put in high yield bank acc. U still pay back to uob card,btohqsg
if i never top up but leave that 5k in my higher yield savings account/ssb/cashfund etc to earn 3-3.5%  that might earn me more rebate over the months. Thats what i mean,btohqsg
Ok la 1 mnthbin wallet and 1 mnth I bank account. But then u can't take money from uob absolute and transfer to bank acc,btohqsg
so in this case if u top up  yes next month u $5k down since u have to pay the credit card bill.but the $5k that u topped up is not earning u any interest as it sits in Grab wallet i mean,btohqsg
does axs app accept amex cc payment,btohqsg
If need the amt in 3 to 6 month to pay bills 1.7 is ok,btohqsg
Earn u thr 1.7% lor. 2nd mnth nothing.But inbank.is3.5% for 12 mnth 0.3%. U need put in bank for 6 mnths to get the same,btohqsg
Coz if u put it as annual rate it is 3.4 percent annual,btohqsg
Just depend how soon u will use up the money in grabpay,btohqsg
I have insurance coming in jan so i am surely topping up for that before the nerf,btohqsg
hi sifus  wanna check if I charge $500 of my insurance charges to my UOB evol  does it count toward uob one bonus interest criteria?Cannot pay insurance next year by amex-grab anymore need to to find alternative haha,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see Amex though.I might be wrongi will try add amex in my next income tax bill cycle see how. If can then dont need grab le,btohqsg
no. Grab blocked youtrip  revolut topups,btohqsg
I don't have any other way to top up Youtrip other than PayNow.knowing that once i topped up  i can't withdraw this cash also.,btohqsg
but top up using paynow is still better than paying 3.25% foreign rate conversion fee on credit cards,btohqsg
also  revolut doesnt accept amex card top up,btohqsg
Amex absolute cashback still able to earn ‚Ä¶. Sooo,btohqsg
Why dont consider using Maybank Platinum Visa Card instead?,btohqsg
Don't put to much into GrabPayUse it to top-up MRT cardMrt card not top-upGrabPay still - the amountNow called grab HQ for refundThis is not the first time issueReally need to look for other AMEX to master card convertorGrabPay not stable,btohqsg
btw any one try apply for maybank ran into issue like using singpass myinfo they say data not able to capture,btohqsg
its been months like no fix,btohqsg
Sorry i did not encounter any issue with the sign up,btohqsg
dont know if maybank dont like mac,btohqsg
use diff browser also got issue,btohqsg
they only have $300 tier and $1k tier.while the rebate is similar to UOB one  the Quarterly service fee of S$20 is a turn off.,btohqsg
eg  if u spend $300 for 3 consecutive months  then get $30 rebate  only to pay off $20 service fee  means rebate is $10 right?,btohqsg
$10/$900 x 100% = 1.11%means i only get 1.11% effective rebate after spending $300/mth for 3 consecutive months nett of fees,btohqsg
But the service fee is waived,btohqsg
under what circumstances waived?its for 1st 3 yrs only waived,btohqsg
so u are saying this card only useful for 1st 3 yrs?,btohqsg
Subsequent service fee is waive when you charge to your card once every 3 mths,btohqsg
Maybank say this service fee cannot be waived after the 3yrs fee waiver period. Subsequently must pay. So means if u want this card  the lifespan will be only for 1st 3 yrs. After that no use to have it since the fees will eat into your rebates and make u earn less.,btohqsg
Does the SRS means that it only make sense if you believe that at retirement your taxable income is much lower than your current income,btohqsg
Thanks for the info. I will double check with Maybank when I get the chance. Are there any more cashback credit cards you would recommend for a low spender. About $300 monthly,btohqsg
SRS is for tax deferment. Use it if u got spare cash and want to reduce your taxible income. But remember  the cash in SRS u need to invest it otherwise it will sit there earning 0.05% interest.,btohqsg
i am using UOB ONE.But i'm  also researching for no min spend credit cards as a replacement for my  UOB ONE Absolute,btohqsg
my situation is similar to yours.in the sense that my spendin is like $500-800.So while i hit the $500 UOB ONE quota  that extra $300 doesn't earn rebates.so yah  i need to find replacement coz my UOB Absolute +GrabPay Mastercard combo just nerfedi.e. i'm looking for a card that earns rebates for spending $300 or less and that 1 off big purchase of like $8k or something.,btohqsg
if u are a SAFRA member  u can sign up for this DBS SAFRA card. no annual fee as long as u safra member and no min spend.i spend $0.01 on this card monthly to meet the spend requirement for DBS multiplier =phttps://www.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/safra-dbs-card?country_code=sg&affiliate_category=credit-cards&category_slug=best-credit-cards&channel=credit-cards&locale=en&product_slug=safra-dbs-card&provider_slugs=dbs&toggle&forceTest=test&widget_type=inline-widget&affiliate_id=1,btohqsg
Thanks for the recommendation. Too bad the min spend is $500.,btohqsg
hsbc revo - maybank plat visa,btohqsg
UOB Absolute on its own is still good (1.7%) but obviously hampered by limited Amex acceptance. Can also consider HSBC Advance (1.5-2.5% + 1% Everyday+ cashback) or Citi Cash Back+ (1.6%).,btohqsg
Whats the max spending for citi rewards to earns 4mpd?,btohqsg
any idea what the next tbills interest will be? higher or lower than 4.4,btohqsg
The service fee is waived as long as you make one qualifying transaction on your card every 90 days,btohqsg
I'm liking HSBC Advance credit vs HSBC Revolution and Maybank Platinum visa.Because it's way more flexible. 1.5% base rate for any spend below 2k  if hit 2k  then get 2.5%this somehow fits my need to replace the UOB Absolute+GPMC combo. coz HSBC advance credit is not AMEX means accepted wider.,btohqsg
then i guess maybank platinum visa is good for those who keep to the $$300 quota. So it's list a mini version of the UOB ONe card.same 3.33% just that the min spend is $300 and don't have preferred merchants,btohqsg
Youtrip revolut instaremAll only top-up or link by master card?,btohqsg
All can topup with Visa or Mastercard  but Revolut will charge 1.5% fee for Visa credit card topups.Instarem can also link to Mastercard.,btohqsg
Yup. Just make sure not to use for overseas/foreign currency spend as that only gives 0.3% cashback,btohqsg
for oversease  i'll use my UOB ONE which gives 3.33% base interest  then less 3.25% foreign exchange fees = 0.08% rebate. Something better than nothing.,btohqsg
Local banks will also use a marked up exchange rate so you will pay more than just 3.25%. Better to use YouTrip/Revolut.,btohqsg
Oh ya that‚Äôs true. Meaning that even though I earn 0.08%  I still lose coz the bank spreads are in their favour.Right.YouTrip  revolut  InstaRem it isüí™,btohqsg
Thank youAll 3 not for meAny prepared master card available?,btohqsg
How do I troubleshoot login issue via fb with instarem? It force close whenever I login.Support team ticket raised but no reply thus far,btohqsg
Are you looking for cashback or low FX cards?,btohqsg
It's AMEX to master card convertorAxs only accept master card,btohqsg
Amex TCB > GrabPay is the only option left,btohqsg
This one even crystal ball cannot answer you,btohqsg
then should i go for a non-compet bid  or still ownself try that range?,btohqsg
Once the grab AXS link is broken... That's the final final nail.,btohqsg

I need advice on this transaction. Will CRMC get 4mpd in this case? For context  this merchant was a nail and lash shop in JB. The card I paired with was SC simply cash card and that did give me 1.5% cashback.,btohqsg
Yes will get 4mpd for CRMC,btohqsg
Even when amaze categorised it as utility?,btohqsg
Seems like no promo for AMEX TC currently,btohqsg
Hi guys  not sure if this has been asked before. For large hospital bill like 10k+ and banquet also 10k  what's the best CC to go to? Since citi amaze best only for first 1k. Is it Citi cashback+ is the next best option? TIA,btohqsg
Btw Amaze+Citibank cashback card. If overseas dining using Amaze and charge to Citibank Cashback  will it entitled to 8%? Or the MCC code will change to online and don‚Äôt have the 8% cashback?,btohqsg

Uob amex no cap if hospital support it,btohqsg
Nets prepaid top up is only visa and mc right?,btohqsg
Uob amex >  pre paid nets card > axsSold by MRT,btohqsg
My question remains. How do you top up nets flashpay with Amex?,btohqsg
Also axs does not accept nets flashpay. SAM does.,btohqsg
All prepaid nets are flash pay?Like this can't workSam don't support my bill ü§£,btohqsg
There's this one but you need to use the NETS App. GTM doesn't work.https://www.nets.com.sg/personal/retail-payments/nets-prepaid-card/,btohqsg
it does? That's news to me.,btohqsg
So I use net app top up via amex ?,btohqsg
The nets pay are use of netsapp,btohqsg
This method use to pay what I'm ax's app ? Insurance,btohqsg
If this no flashpay than work,btohqsg

Curious - anyone on the GXS platform yet?,btohqsg
Applied Amex TCB card. Any idea how long it will take to arrive ?,btohqsg
Whats the procedure to open joint account?,btohqsg
The NETS prepaid card looks like it might work with TCB but not Absolute (since Absolute outright exludes NETS transactions),btohqsg
Hospital bill u see if u can pay using Amex. If can  then use AMEX TCB 1.5% or UOB Absolute Amex 1.7%.For wedding venue. Same strategy if u have enough credit balance that is. But for myself  since I‚Äôm using UOB ONE  I ask the hotel to split the cost into monthly instalment and every month I pay manually using my UOB ONE card to hit the $2k quota.,btohqsg
TCB approval and sending of card one of the fastest if no issue,btohqsg
I use UOB ONE.Base 3.33% rebate on eligible spend.For SP u get 1% more rebate. Total 4%Electricity provider  mobile phone bills get base 3.33%.Simply go get extra 5-6.67%. Total 8.87-10%,btohqsg
The NETS transactions exclusion is for using the Absolute card as a NETS card  not for topping up NETS cards. However  question still remains: NETS app allows Amex top ups meh.,btohqsg
according to the FAQ looks like its supported,btohqsg
i guess we'll have to see how Absolute handles this transaction,btohqsg
Your breakeven point is a $30 top up (assuming 1.7% cashback on UOB Absolute),btohqsg
If you're using it solely to pay for bills it seems ok,btohqsg
Dotm think axs accept nets card as pay all type right?,btohqsg
Some needs bank transfer to pay,btohqsg
Not sure  the prepaid card is a new thing,btohqsg
But looks like anywhere that accepts NETS can accept the card,btohqsg
The nets card I think can buy from mrt station the booth,btohqsg
Ya but from the looks here mostly is eanr to use thsk hacks to pay via axs ahah not use nets to pay on retailers,btohqsg
More like a replacement for grab Nerf,btohqsg
Yes netsapp support AMEXHave added my card to itSimply go support amex as well can add nets card to simply go for top-upOr top-up from the MRT station machine,btohqsg
Topping up the nets not a issueIs this nets card bought from MRT stationIs it support by axs,btohqsg
If u use simplygo with uob absolute card will not earn 1.7% cashback,btohqsg
Oooh! Because UOB Absolute Card uses NETS for SimplyGo which is an excluded transaction from cashback.,btohqsg
Don't think so it support netpay not this net prepaid,btohqsg

Hi sifus  i just applied UOB Absolute CB Card from Singsaver last two weeks ago.Should i continue with the application as they requested additional documents but it is going to nerf the grab topup?But Singsaver is giving $300 cash!,btohqsg
get it  faster milk it before 15 Jan and claim the signup bonus. Then wait until AF charged then cancel.,btohqsg
Would it affect the credit report if cancel the credit card so early?,btohqsg
I think you can continue to use. 1.7% no limit. except Grab wallet top up has dropped to 0.3%. But one thing you need to note - this card cannot be use on (e.g.) Samsung pay.. for mobile spend...,btohqsg
UOB absolute singsaver is only first ‚Äú100 signups‚Äù and this ‚Äúpromo‚Äù is always there  even on the UOB website but you have no way of knowing if you‚Äôre part of the 100,btohqsg
Every application will ding the report a little bit but shouldn't be significant. Early cancellation has no effect on credit score. Of course  the more you pay on time  the better your credit score will be.,btohqsg
Yes Fraser App. My contribution as a new joiner,btohqsg
If the Fraser mall has a NTUC  you use the Fraser credits to buy NTUC voucher which can be used in NTUCs of Fraser malls only.,btohqsg
Yea thats true. So it‚Äôs like a bet?,btohqsg

You are correct. Fraser Credit accepted in most shops @ Waterway point.,btohqsg
Do note max purchase of 4x$100 per Fraser account,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure  if anyone got the 300$ ‚Äúcredit‚Äù before I‚Äôm all ears lol.Money smart had a 50$ promo last month  if can wait for it. But goodness  UOB customer service is so awful and I couldn‚Äôt signup cos the shitty form doesn‚Äôt work but they insisted it did,btohqsg
Quite less right for Moneysmart? But is guaranteed can get?,btohqsg
Still can add in the 20% pointsback for Grabpay online reward,btohqsg
For UOB credit card  usually the sign up bonus very less one?And I already applied and it‚Äôs still pending due to additional documents needed  if I applied another UOB credit card  do i still new to bank?,btohqsg

does grab power up challange points rewards count towards the criteria for maintaining platinum grab status?e.g. if can get 20k grab points for completing the challenge  then 20k points already more tahn enough to meet the 4.5k threshold for platinum.,btohqsg
Although pity that only useful for those whom frequent Fraser malls and not the entire channel will benefit from this combo hack,btohqsg
Doubt so‚Ä¶ but you may check and correct.,btohqsg
Anyone heard of or involved in preferred financing ? Tks,btohqsg
if cancel within 6 mths  do check for cancellation fees. Usually cancelling within 6 mths affects credit score. check with bank how long does it take for them to count u as a new customer. Usually it's about a year. i.e. if u cancelled a card then wait 1 yr and sign back again  they see u as new customer n then u can rinse repeat to milk promos.,btohqsg
Does amex TCB have any amex discounts or privileges that are noticeably good (aside from the latest chain hack)? For example i have hsbc revo and cpm which I have experienced tangible benefits like hsbc entertainer app 1-for-1/25% off and citi-agoda promotion recently,btohqsg
also  usually their rewards if u every are one of the 100 is given 90-120 days after meeting the qualifications. Usually when i sign up using SiingSaver   i need to either chase them to check or just sign up and hope for the best if i lazy to chase.,btohqsg
think if use frazer app E-vouher cant use the self  check out at ntuc need goto the cashier counter?,btohqsg
go to the cashier aunty safer coz she got the qr code scanner. But u can always as the aunty at the self check out if the counter there got the scannner,btohqsg

Good ideas.. other than this ?,btohqsg
No more ideas that I am aware of. Limited lobangs haha,btohqsg
Isn't Kris+ also considered online transaction? Why need amaze for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Because citi has this weird rule that mobile wallets like Google pay are not considered as online,btohqsg
Since UOB Absolute to Grab nerfed  means I got to use the old method of top up via Paynow and then use this to pay off Bills via AXS mobile and earn 12k grab point which is worth $24.$24 rewards divide by $1100 top up x 100% = 2.18% return.I think this is the workaround the nerf.Only issue is the challenge is usually only 1 month then the bills I have doesn‚Äôt add up to so high.,btohqsg
Haha its ok . Appreciate it,btohqsg
Hold up. AXS doesn't count to power up.,btohqsg
Haizzz back to the drawing board,btohqsg

hi guys. I have a burning question.for UOB fixed deposit  they will require 'fresh funds'if I transfer from my DBS bank to my UOB savings account  does still that count? thanks!,btohqsg
Add Amaze to Google Pay  then add Google Pay to Kris+,btohqsg
Fresh funds generally refers to money credited to the bank from outside the bank. So DBS to UOB is considered fresh funds. But do take note that if this is to take advantage of some promo  there are usually conditions attached to that promo. These conditions can very greatly so you should read the fine print.,btohqsg
it should be eligible if dining mcc,btohqsg
if u using iphone cannot use Amaze for kris+. For the kris+ mastercard promo can use dbs wwmc on applepay,btohqsg

How is the Citi charges for oversea swipe? YouTrip and Revolut has the good conversion rate. But Revolut has extra charges on weekend,btohqsg
It will use amaze X change rate at a spread of 1-2% right?,btohqsg

Anyone has suggestions on which card to use for mcc 7311 (ads)?,btohqsg

Unfortunately i'm a property agent so no registered business üòÇ and there's a cap of 200sgd cashback a month  and total 600sgd cashback cap. So not quite worth to go thru the trouble...But thanks for sharing!!!!,btohqsg

yup. I've given up waiting and gone with another bank alr,btohqsg

It done thru liquidpay  thr transaction on uob one card is considered eligible transaction for the for the 3.33% cashback?,btohqsg
just called them. they say after meet all criteria (including min 2k for 30days) + 1-7days then the usd$150 will be in the in-transit tab. so 30+ days then can see the voucher feedback. i nv asked about the referral feedback.,btohqsg
Hi everyone!I am new here and I would like to seek some advise from everyone here.I recently placed $40k fixed deposit with UOB.Now that the UOB One account has increased the interest rate to payout 5% PA on interest for the first $100k  I am looking to open that account and deposit another $100k.That would effectively mean that I will have $140k worth of deposits with UOB. May I please seek some advise from this group with regards to the SDIC coverage? Will it be $75k coverage for the entire UOB deposit or will it be $75k coverage for Fixed Deposit  and another $75k coverage for the $100k deposit? Meaning the remaining $25k from the $100k will not be covered.Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Effective is 2.6% but that 1% is not direct rebate but in the form of points which u need to accumulate up in blocks of 1000 or something before it can be used to offset a future purchase.Regardless  foreign exchange fees of cards is usually 3.25% so  2.6% minus 3.25% is already -0.65%. Then remember  bank Fx spreads is damn bad. Means u won‚Äôt get the same rate as google conversion but some rate that‚Äôs in favour of the bank.Likely  the bad Fx spread will cause your -0.65% to be even lower. Meaning u will confirm plus chop lose $.Edit: I stand corrected.Amaze converts the foreign spend to Sgd then charges to the card. Skipping the foreign exchange fee of the card. So u are right.,btohqsg
Deposit in $2k. But stock worth at least $100 USD. U can sell immediately if u want. Bottom like  do not withdraw any cash for the full 30 days. U can check your progress and how many days left in your profile page.Note:Buying $100 USD worth of stocks only gets u $100 USD rewards.If u want the remaining $50 USD rewards  u need to do 1 options trade. If u never do the latter  u only get $100 USD.At the end of the 30 days  WeBull will alert u or u can manually check your progress. Regardless  it will take about 7 business days for the $ to be credited back into your account.,btohqsg
I use YouTrip. Fuss free spending  better exchange rate than Amaze  no weird spending timing charges over weekends or weird hours of the day.Resolut I use to withdraw cash overseas. Can withdraw up to $350 daily. No fees.YouTrip need to pay $5 per withdrawal.,btohqsg
1st $75k with the bank as an entity.Means if UOB close shop  SDIC protects $75k out of your $40k+$100k only,btohqsg
Clearly understood! Thanks a lot Zan!,btohqsg
If u have alot of cash  diversity it across more banks  put into SG savings bonds (capital guaranteed up to $200k) or put into brokerages eg Moomoo  Tiger  WeBull which are all MAS approved and protected behind multiple layers of insurances.,btohqsg
Definitely will explore those areas too! Still in the process of learning right now as I just started my career. Thanks a lot buddy!,btohqsg
Yup. I am relatively a low risk taker and this gives a lot of assurance. Thanks a lot Zan!,btohqsg
Anyway  u should checkout the Fullerton Cash Fund (SGD) provided by all 3 brokers as a low risk alternative than the banks higher yield savings accounts because these just give u straight returns accrued daily without any hoops to jump thro unlike banks.,btohqsg
Yeah but Youtrip do not have MYR and THB. Good for JPY  EURO and CHF though,btohqsg
I would very much like to look into this fund. I'll research about it! Thank you!!,btohqsg
Actually while u can‚Äôt hold the currency or exchanging it prior to your trip to lock in the rates  that doesn‚Äôt stop u from spending using it.YouTrip will still covert MYR to SGD n deduct from your wallet.Yes YouTrip only can hold 10 currencies but supports hundreds more.But this MAS approved digital wallet only allows u max $5k SGD. So unless u are some money changer or something  exchanging large sums of currency to take advantage of forex spreads shouldn‚Äôt be the main reason for stocking up foreign currency. Remember  YouTrip doesn‚Äôt allow withdrawals of funds back to bank account. Unless u withdraw cash overseas via ATM but that‚Äôll cost you $5 per withdrawal.Also doesn‚Äôt make sense u withdraw so much cash overseas such that u have to declare on the way back.Alternatively u can try other multi currency wallets n see if they have the currency u want. Then u can do the exchange in-app.,btohqsg
YouTrip stores 10 currencies but supports hundreds more. See this example when I went Thailand last time. It converts Thai Baht to Sgd and deducts from my YouTrip wallet.https://support.you.co/hc/en-us/articles/900000378763-Which-currencies-are-supported-,btohqsg
Ic  thanks. Question is you will not be able to know the rate before spending‚Ä¶ know is not much  but personally I dun feel good spending without knowing the rate.,btohqsg
Hmmm just did a live compare. Seems like Youtrip use without knowing the rate seems better? Assuming bank commission for master portal is 0%.,btohqsg
Correct u won‚Äôt know coz it fluctuates by the second.But remember  the equation goes both ways. Even if u are able to lock in good rates  if u want to exchange those foreign currency back to SGD  it might take a while for the weaker currency to improve. Some never do.,btohqsg
Youtrip is 26.11  Revolut is 25.86,btohqsg
Not using it for forex. Just overseas spend hehe.,btohqsg
Thanks  will try Youtrip during ny next bkk trip,btohqsg
Deduct from your youtrip sgd wallet?,btohqsg
I mean if u exchange so much foreign  currency at a good rate but never spend it all  then u want to change it back to SGD  I doubt the rates would improve so much.,btohqsg
Most likely wont change back  just leave it for next trip.,btohqsg
YouTrip is a prepaid wallet mah. U need to top up before your trip. U top up is in Sgd de,btohqsg
What if I have bal in sgd jpy and usd? That is what I am referring to. Lol,btohqsg
U can change the currency in-app,btohqsg
Few years back then no lock down on geo location when performing transaction. Not sure if Youtrip has changed it due to whatever MAS restriction caused by the ocbc saga   that topup can only happen on SGP? Just a noob question.,btohqsg
I know can change in app‚Ä¶ my qns if i have 3 currency in my wallet and I spend in thb  it will deduct from which currency first? Naturally should be sgd.. just making sure it is SGD,btohqsg
Amaze+Citibank cashback can? If don‚Äôt have Citibank rewards.. üòÖ,btohqsg
Yeah this is a worry for me also. Ie if I can‚Äôt top up YouTrip via Paynow when I‚Äôm in a foreign country coz the bank thinks it‚Äôs fraudulent transaction.Prior to the trip  u can add a credit card as a backup to YouTrip. I won‚Äôt get reward points coz credit cards don‚Äôt count top ups as eligible spend but it a backup for it Paynow top up fails.I usually call the bank before the trip to tell them i‚Äôm going overseas and which card I‚Äôll be using so that they don‚Äôt Geo lock that.,btohqsg
Frazier promo voucher all sold out,btohqsg
YouTrip will deduct in a certain order,btohqsg

Those who got Samsung pay can redeem this too,btohqsg
You mean some say Citibank credit card can accept Hospital bills as minimum spend?,btohqsg

Yes. Will have to do it manually though.,btohqsg
So means when I paywave to pay  it will deduct from my $11 cashback?,btohqsg
No. The cashback wont be automatically deducted from your paywave spendings.SMS to 72484: RWDS<space>Last 4 digits of your card number<CASH10>Example: RWDS 9999 CASH10It is a manual way of redeeming your cashback.,btohqsg
Interesting.After I done this  then it can automatically deduct from the cashback?,btohqsg

I see. It was not on GrabReward when I tried to search yesterday. But it appeared magically after seeing your post and I thought why not try searching again  and holy cow it is there! Not a Samsung Pay user btw. üòä,btohqsg

Planning to go holiday in Malaysia soon but don't want to carry cash Ard over there.Can those experienced advice if it be better for me to transfer the money that I were to spend/ pay ie: hotel stay and dining be safe and easy transact if I were to transfer them to revolut Card here before going Malaysia then just pay using the revolut Card rather than cash there?,btohqsg
I received an email/sms saying UOB Absolute AMEX now only has 0.3% cashback for Grab top ups ü•≤,btohqsg
Yep  old news and has been discussed extensively for the past few days.,btohqsg
The card itself is 1.6% cash back  similar to other 1.5% ones. Major diff is the Cashback need to be redeemed manually (only via sms) in blocks of 10/20/50 dollars.Most other cards do auto Cashback for any odd amount,btohqsg
Since Grabpay+UOB combi has been nerfed  I am switching my strategy to using Citi Cashback+ with Samsung pay. So that I can earn 1.6% cashback and gain samsung reward pts.,btohqsg
Yea thats what I thought as well. I can't even see when the billing cycle date,btohqsg
I know AMEX TCB 3%promo can‚Äôt use for Grab but how about 1.5% normal cashback? Is it still working?,btohqsg
Wah.... I only hold the card for less than 1 year then this happens with grab pay... Not worth it... Need to apply other cards that benefits.,btohqsg
Btw  how many cc can 1 person have max?,btohqsg
Not sure but can be a lot. Guess Chris have more than 10 card.  Just need to apply separately every month.,btohqsg
Maybe can ask Chris to show us his cards collection album.,btohqsg
I'm intending to get 1 card which is good for miles and point. But now sure which card and how to build the point cos I'm new to this miles thingy,btohqsg
Read up & check Chris reviews,btohqsg
Hi  does this method work to pay CC bills.?Use Amex TCB or UOB Absolute top-up Grab.Use Grab to pay CC bills via AXS.Any info?Thank you,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt matter. U can have a lot of card as long as your cbr is healthy,btohqsg
Is a matter of the total unsecured loan that ur entitled to,btohqsg
I did this using absolute. But didn't see the cashback,btohqsg
Even if you top up with grab to get the 1.5/1.7%. THen use Grab to pay CC bills?,btohqsg
Now I'm thinking if I should cancel my absolute card and get another diff card. But not sure if it will hurt my credit score cos absolute card is less than 1 year.,btohqsg
Anyone heard of or involved in preferred financing ? Tks,btohqsg
not possible cashback was not credited since it was grab top ups and its eligible. For UOB Abs  CB is posted in the following month's statements,btohqsg
Recalled some say UOB amex Cash back delayed usually More like 3 mth,btohqsg
Anex issued don't have this issue is issued same months state ment,btohqsg
3 months? Have not experienced that myself as of late. All my CB are posted timely in the following month‚Äôs statements,btohqsg
To clarify 3 months meaning 3rd statement?,btohqsg
Correct me if im wrong   but from what I understand  it's never possible to earn cashback through paying off credit card bills..,btohqsg
Yep  but if its possible to do it via grab  you can earn cashback  as the cashback is from topping up,btohqsg
Morning guys  just wanna to check if anyone have purchased ziptracks from Legate  which MCC code would it under(trying to see if I can use my OCBC titanium card to earn 4 mpd here),btohqsg

Thanks everyone who updated about ipaymy already nerfed with Uob one!  Meant that as a question instead of a statement.,btohqsg
Yes  to earn EIR 3% interest per month,btohqsg
That one I'm not sure  have to check with UOB,btohqsg
If you're willing to do money transfers every month  you can watch this video for some recommendationshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETTE16S8VLw,btohqsg
if not  some accounts I can recommend are SIF GoSavers  SC Jumpstart  Trust Bank and Singlife,btohqsg
Hi. Can check is the Maybank f&f card 8% rebate eligible with the amaze card?,btohqsg
Only on the eligible MCCs. Merchant-specific 8% rate not eligible,btohqsg
Oic. Hard to know the MCCs... What abt the Citi cash back?  Same?,btohqsg
Same but Citi Cash Back only has MCC bonuses. No merchant-specific bonuses,btohqsg
Yes it's hard to know the exact MCCs but you can agak agak. Example: NTUC will always be supermarket,btohqsg
I use the f&f for dining. I check the transaction on valid for the 8%,btohqsg
Maybe it's classified fast food which is ineligible for 8%. These things happen.,btohqsg
Lol. Encounter b4. Tks. I will take note,btohqsg
Any reccomendation for a CC for travel expense...? Agoda booking.com  abnb ... booking? So far reccomended is DBS WWC..,btohqsg

Guys. Anybody know. If I use amaze as public transport tapping like simplygo. Will there be miles clocked ?,btohqsg
Can keep the card  especially if you exceed the annual e-wallet limit of $30k annually,btohqsg
Depends on your credit card and the eligible mcc,btohqsg
So dining Maybank F&F and OCBC 365 are one of thw cc good for dining?,btohqsg
How abt MCC codes? Where can we get the updates ones? Diff bank diff MCC for rebate/cash back?,btohqsg
Not sure for 365. I use f&f more. But have min spending of $800. Per cat cap at $25 rebate.,btohqsg
Yup. After exceeding $30k  the UOB Abs at 1.7% is still the highest cashback card without limit‚Ä¶. For now,btohqsg
Sounds like amaze + CC is more better than Revolut + CC for overseas usage.,btohqsg
Currently limit of e-Wallet can only use up to $30k,btohqsg
Going Malaysia soon... I think I may apply for amaze,btohqsg
Anyone else facing issues with logging in amaze with facebook? ,btohqsg
I did not even realise that was a thing until now lol  I've always used email login,btohqsg

Ya. That's the plan for now... So far only using that to top up grabpay wallet only üòÖ,btohqsg
Does anyone know if I instalment payment on shopee using dbs world card would give 4mpd?,btohqsg
I dont get 1.2mpd for that so I am assuming 4mpd dont apply as well.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs a very open ended question.For starters  I personally feel that CPF Life is a good place to start because it provides a payout for your entire lifetime. So if you‚Äôve not yet reached the current full retirement sum (current FRS: $192k) it‚Äôll be beneficial to top-up CPF by $8k before 31 Dec 2022. You can enjoy tax relief for this.Guys  just a reminder to top-up CPF &/orSRS for tax relief before the end of the year  where appropriate.,btohqsg
is there no promotion currently for new HSBC Revolution signups?,btohqsg
Endowments give a lump sum payout at the end so it‚Äôs useful for long term savings for a big ticket item that one might expect down the road like a parent starting an endowment for their child to help save for University or for wedding/ honeymoon or to buy a house.When one retires  you won‚Äôt need a lump sum‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll need regular payouts for sustenance. In my personal opinion  it might not be the most appropriate product for the purpose although it‚Äôs not particularly bad or anything. Imagine at retirement age  you‚Äôll receive a lump sum that you‚Äôll now need to think how to redeploy / allocate again so that you don‚Äôt run out of money‚Ä¶ a lot of retirees are targeted by scammers because of large savings and because they‚Äôre not usually up to date with prevailing technologies and scams and may not be as alert.Endowment plans also earn relatively low interest because it is low risk.,btohqsg
Of course  you could do several endowments with staggered maturities to help spread out the payouts.But also keep in mind that endowments requires a long term commitment to pay regular premiums. Defaulting or surrendering the policy is likely to result in a loss. Given the low interest  is the long term commitment required to service the premiums worth it? One could get a rider to protect themselves from loss of income‚Ä¶ but the cost of rider would further eat into the already low returns of the policy. People who are not careful  would not even realise that the eventual maturity is not even able to breakeven BECAUSE of the cost of the riders.,btohqsg
GPMC will truly be game over if Amex TCB is also nerfed.,btohqsg
No. Won‚Äôt work. Can‚Äôt pay CC on AXS with GPMC.,btohqsg
If i buy abig purchase of $6k and split for 3 months. Do they count my min spend $2k each mth?,btohqsg
If I use my UOB platinum visa to purchase scoot air ticket online will I be awarded the 4mpd ??,btohqsg
Does anybody know this   can help thanks,btohqsg
If PV give 4mpd for travel and online i guess 4mpd should be awarded,btohqsg
just did a quick check  only mobile contactless  and online shopping & entertainment is counted so i am assuming base on this the air tickets are not eligible for 4mpd,btohqsg
what u mean by split? min spend for what?,btohqsg
of cos not  not in whitelist of mcc for 4mpd for online spend,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I link my Citi rewards + amaze and spend on overseas/local  will I eligible for the singsaver of spending $500 and get $350 cashback?,btohqsg
I bought a few condensed payment endowments when I was younger and staggered the purchase so now I am gradually receiving my lump sum pay out from each maturity every other year or 2-3years. Not a bad thing for me because I am not receiving these staggered payout at a old age/retirement age. The funds are redeployed.,btohqsg
Ok i rephrase. Minimum spending for UOB One card to get higher tier interest is $2000 a month. If i bought a big ticket items that cost $6000 and split it into interest free installments of 3 months which require $2000 monthly  does that eligiblenfor a higher interest since im paying $2000 monthly.,btohqsg
Hi experts  what do you all think of careshield life? Those who are not automatic enrolled should opt in? Or no,btohqsg
I think UOB instalment plan seems not included. Must read the tnc,btohqsg
Installment don't seem to he included and need minimum 5 purchase transaction on the card. Check out the fine print.,btohqsg
If I anticipate to move some $$    and this sum will enable me to be low-tier premier cust  which is the best bank to go to ?,btohqsg

I am just going to use the cc to top up my grab wallet to sufficiently pay for my Jan and Feb insurance fee. Bec got opportunity cost,btohqsg
You can keep the $ In grab,btohqsg
But there is opportunity cost (when u pay your credit card bill) when you can put money in bank to earn high interest  i.e. higher than 1.7%,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the same if you pay tax/insurance in advance,btohqsg
Curious about Maybank visa platinum card it say 3.33% so it's it same as uob one method of spending like I need to spend at least $300 for 3 month before I can get 3.33 orExampleIst month $3002nd month $4003rd month I spent $300So I still consider under 3.33% after I spend total$1000?,btohqsg
in your example  you'll get 3.33% for $900 worth of spending. $100 worth of spending will earn 0 rebate,btohqsg

Ya just for the sake of top up lor jus no points earn,btohqsg

I made the conscious decision to choose GoJek over Grab because of the lower driver commission given to HQ. Now I‚Äôll go back to Grab :(,btohqsg
It depends on how bad the bad scores are. You‚Äôll have to demonstrate consistent and timely payment of credit facilities over six months and then review your credit scores.,btohqsg
Thanks Timothy! But there is no way you can improve the credit score unless one of the many banks going to approve your application of the card.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs right! Do you have any existing credit facilities  such as mortgages or personal loan  with any FI (financial institution) / bank?,btohqsg
Nope I don‚Äôt. All terminated and paid.,btohqsg
Oooh. You paid them all. Hmm.Then you‚Äôd be able to apply for just at least one credit card somewhere  at the very least one of the Big 3 SG banks bah,btohqsg
Is kind of a topic that might be a good YouTube video. But need a lot of research.,btohqsg
All decline due to bad scores,btohqsg
Totally agree. More like other peoples experiences as well.,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs a chicken and egg thing. You cannot improve the score unless you have a credit with them. E.g credit card. But you are not able to get any because of bad scores üòÇ,btohqsg
Probably gotta try those credit cards which requires u to put in certain deposits?Maybe that will help?,btohqsg
The rules state that you‚Äôll have to have at least 30K annual income. In Singapore credit score is based on a variety of factors especially timely repayment  low utilization  long established credit history etchttps://www.creditbureau.com.sg/credit-score.html,btohqsg
So there were suggestions to get from tier 2 or 3 banks  because they have smaller pool and more willing to be open for more clients. Tried. Even diners. üòÇ,btohqsg
‚Ä¶ Or Trust Bank? Should be able to get at the very minimum the $500 credit limit card what,btohqsg
I walked in once to UOB. To pledge 10k deposit. So far no outcome. Been months.,btohqsg
I think have to take a few years to ‚Äúrecover ‚Äú from it.I had a similar incident with UOB Credit cards too. Which is close to almost 15 years agoI just made do with no cards  after a few years I tried again  it worked just fine for me .,btohqsg
Hey thanks for sharing your experience! May I know how many years it took?,btohqsg
See how lor. You usually get a credit report after you apply for a new credit card. Read the report and see what are the adverse factors working against you‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I mean I am not dying to have a credit card. But I m not comfortable using debit only. üòÇ,btohqsg
I really wouldn‚Äôt remember  I was a young adult then probably early 20s don‚Äôt know how to manage my money properly  not a gambling issue  just like to anyhow buy things üòÇEventually I got out of it.,btohqsg
Maybe just to share abit on credit bureau. If you have applied credit cards across banks within a few months. They will drop your scores because they flag it as red as it is a sign of desperation üòÇ then if you request for credit report a few times in a year. It will also falls within the same category  because banks does give free cb reports if you try to apply cards from them.,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing your personal experience. It takes courage. Thumbs up. But ya. We have similar history.,btohqsg
Yep you‚Äôll probably have to see what drives your credit scores down ‚Ä¶ try again 6 months later,btohqsg
So I tried to nego for the recent good FD rate that UOB has. And pledge that amount as collateral for the card. Cannot.,btohqsg
So I believe tier 1 banks are not short of customers. They are choosing quality customers now.,btohqsg
Then diners  the card that almost no place is accepting the card. Also kena rejected. I loled.,btohqsg
For people who have good credit scores or normal credit scores  they usually would not know this issue. Once in. Hard to come out üòÜ,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the fastest way to clear $100 grab power up challenge?,btohqsg
Is it still recommended to sign up for SMART Standard Chartered Credit card? mainly for bus & mrt,btohqsg
Just speed $100 on food during Xmas eve. Not sure is that counted as grab power up,btohqsg
While cashback of 6% is decent  the cashback options v limited.Also if you enter the SC mobile app  you don‚Äôt get cashback directly but have to redeem ‚Äúpoints‚Äù which are like 3200 for $10. I used it for simplygo and some fast food only and had to take a long time (6-9months) to get just $10 off. Me taking the rewards and running from SC thereafter lolThose with wider categories and more direct Cashback (eg. DBS your spending in month automatically credited as Cashback) is a much more palatable optionJust my $0.02,btohqsg
