Tampines -https://t.me/TampinesBTOAug2020GreenOpal -https://t.me/joinchat/H80QNQ8qMfbua1uLop8l4QGreencrest / Greenglade -https://t.me/joinchat/D0JphxpomGm5iC7yFC05kgBut... enter at your own risk  some of them kinda provocative  but I believe no question is a stupid qns. They‚Äôre literally annoyed and replied rudely when people ask qns even though those info can be found online ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Lol are you referring to me??,btohqsg
