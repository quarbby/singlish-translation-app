(if it's tuition alone  that is),btohqsg
I know my friendâ€™s dad pay ard $40k idk per sem or yr for australia doctor degree,btohqsg
Problem is idk if after grad how coz her australia degree probs not recognised in sg,btohqsg
Are Singapore doctors paid the highest in the world,btohqsg
By no means! US doctors paid way more ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Every few days I hear Americans complaining how come most American hospitals with basic amenities are private,btohqsg
That's not due to doctors' pay though. It's cos of the following graph:,btohqsg
Way too many administrators doing busywork adding to the overheads,btohqsg
That one is like American rates ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Oh you mean the ones behind the counters,btohqsg
Behind the counters  behind the scenes  insurance adjusters  etc etc,btohqsg
Way to many people employed in healthcare who do jackshit,btohqsg
So much manpower and their hospitals get regular lighting and water outages,btohqsg
As I have always said. Why be a doctor having to waste so much time in getting a license when u get to be the administrator and practise medicine still just without a license,btohqsg
It's not like the doctors will be able to do what they want without you. They can recommend surgery but u are the one who gatekeeps the funds.,btohqsg
Isit true that taking the ambulance in the us will cost 1k,btohqsg
Btw a while back I did some maths and came to the conclusions of basically hoe business works in america,btohqsg
Yes  and even more in some cases. Which is why you see injured people jumping out of ambulances.,btohqsg
Can't afford the ride  they'd rather take an uber to hospital after traffic accidents ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
People legit get bankrupted by ambulance rides,btohqsg
Do you think this calculation is valid ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
The picture is not very accurate. You must consider the people who are employed skimming off the top of the system,btohqsg
The US insurance adjustment system is very convoluted.,btohqsg
To accomodate  naturally  a similarly convoluted regulatory system and internal revenue code,btohqsg
Don't forget the jobs that bring the votes!,btohqsg
At least I was close? I guess,btohqsg
Remember  1 percent of the us workforce are insurance adjusters,btohqsg
At least that is how I concluded hospitals making money,btohqsg
Btw a ambulance just have to take 90 patients and they can make back enough to buy a new ambulance that can operate for 10yrs,btohqsg
It is as much about keeping people employed and happy as it is about profit.,btohqsg
Some poor people don't mind it though  cos they are already bankrupt  can't hurt them anymore â˜ ,btohqsg
In the us all you have to do once you are bankcrupt is start doing insurance scams,btohqsg
The moment one of them sticks  you will get some moolah,btohqsg
If u are injured  wun u prioritise getting treated over money,btohqsg
That won't work. If you're bankrupt  your credit score is gone  no one will sell you insurance in the first place,btohqsg
ad nauseum. the us is #1 for people jumping out of ambulances,btohqsg
Oh yea btw have you also heard about how if a major corporation vehicle strikes you or causes you to crash  you can settle for very large settlement,btohqsg
depends on the skill of your personal injury lawyer,btohqsg
If you are in an accident  lawyers proactively seek you out,btohqsg
"They will represent you for ""free""  but take a % of your judgement/settlement",btohqsg
Idk if it's true but there a rumor going around telling people to brakecheck trucks where the drivers have a tendency to look at their phones owned by coca cola  FedEx  ups etc,btohqsg
Once struck  they can call for a out of court settlement and usually these settlements pay way more than court settlements,btohqsg
Depends on the jury too  really.,btohqsg
And the state your accident occurs in.,btohqsg
But yeah  an out of court settlement ends up being cheaper for everyone,btohqsg
Yep  now that's one of those ka-ching juries who award massive damages,btohqsg
Big pay day for the lawyer  probably,btohqsg
3 people dead but damn all the victims family caught a windfall,btohqsg
Lawyer probably took home more than the family. Typically the case with these things,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ The us really is a joke of a place,btohqsg
