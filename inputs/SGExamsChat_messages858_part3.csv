Idk how they wld test it tho,btohqsg
If only i was born 2 years earlierðŸ˜­,btohqsg
i think they completely overhaul syllabus,btohqsg
Nah man  i rather be born 2 years earlier,btohqsg
u dont like the math & gp change ah,btohqsg
The batches before 2018 batch did pratical but like for 3 seperate days,btohqsg
i'm happy to never take a levels again unless it's for fun,btohqsg
Now all 3 experiments need do in the same day,btohqsg
is group theory for 16 year old impressive,btohqsg
It depends on their math backgrnd tbh,btohqsg
i'm applying to moe osap using group theory,btohqsg
I think it wld be quite impressive,btohqsg
i am studying Paolo Aluffi rn,btohqsg
people who just go through the moe system normally wouldn't even know the word group theory,btohqsg
Not even a h3 math student knows this,btohqsg
interestingly they study rings first before groups,btohqsg
i do not have any extra classes  only self-study,btohqsg
i mean you're not gonna find classes for that stuff outside of uni anyway,btohqsg
Wld say it wld be quite impressive,btohqsg
my main interest is actually exploring ways to connect group theory / abstract algebra with other fields in mathematics,btohqsg
seeing the Monstrous Moonshine conjecture (groups & complex analysis) and Fermat's Last Thm,btohqsg
Well wld say I have heard of ppl using grp theory for like molecules and crystalline structures that's for sure,btohqsg
that could be one point i can explore,btohqsg
Smth abt lie grp or idk,btohqsg
I'm not a math person haha,btohqsg
But have seen ppl in astar talk abt it before,btohqsg
Content might be slightly harder but papers are easier now. No more 12m planning qns  time pressure slightly reduced since itâ€™s 75m each for p2 & p3 and 50m for p4 now  and a slight reduction in the proportion of marks allocated to higher-order thinking skills,btohqsg
Every year the 12m planning qn is poorly done lol,btohqsg
I still hate the fact they change gp from 12 qns to just 8,btohqsg
hmm also a lot of quantum logic gates form abelian groups,btohqsg
probably to reduce spotting and encourage ppl to actually build up knowledge in various topics,btohqsg
I find that quite questionable tho,btohqsg
Idk it's really odd because the paper is more supposed to focus on like language skills and how you form an arguement and such,btohqsg
Not about how much you know,btohqsg
but at the same time it trains you to actually become a world citizen,btohqsg
But wld still highly recommend choosing 5 topics for gp that you are interested though,btohqsg
And then just build up from there,btohqsg
I think for mine i rmb just focusing more on the arts and education topics but not on the politics and ethics topics lmao,btohqsg
"it;s not really just ""language & argumentative skills""",btohqsg
It's also:- Understand better the world and themselves by fostering a critical awareness of continuity and change in thehuman experience- Broaden their global outlook and deepen their understanding of local issues as well as how issues of regionaland global importance relate to Singapore,btohqsg
"I mean of course is not ""just"" that uh",btohqsg
there's a reason why gp there is more mark weightage to content,btohqsg
I mean of course there is that uh,btohqsg
But still it doesnt make sense to have lesser qns and lesser options to choose from*,btohqsg
GP is the art of bullshitting and YappingEnglish is the art of fluffery,btohqsg
i guess they want people to understand a wider range of issues and not just know and spot just 1 or 2 topics which is likely to come out in the list of 12 qns,btohqsg
English Compo u need to write it in a specific structure. GP dun care one,btohqsg
I have never heard of any one just focusing on 1 topic,btohqsg
For GP I know some focus on a specific niche like for your society questions or smth,btohqsg
Oh that one is cus they have no choice,btohqsg
