Am still holding Sinarmas and Wee Hur as I believe that they still have huge upside over short term given their low PE and PB ratio.Added China Everbright and SIIC as they've low PE and PB  and given the huge China Gov's stimulus  I think interest will come after market see how fast the sp of depressed s-chips such as Yanlord and Sunpower turned around in just a few sessions.There are already sign of liquidity flowing to the two counters since yesterday  small but steady.Here are some data on China Everbright:- Share price- 25.5 - 26c- EPS 7c (PE x 3.7)- NAV 67c (PB x 0.38)- Div 2.12c (Yield 8.1%) on 30% payout- Gearing 60.7% against Industry Avg of 65 - 70%- Avg Interest Rate ~ 2.67%- ROC of 10% and hence mgt guided to keep gearing to 60.7% but will go for more asset light biz in future.DYODD yah,btohqsg

peisey.. busy trading US indices..tmr we see can put pUt PUT 💨💨 or not.. 🤣,btohqsg
Amongst PUT  KORE and MUST  PUT is the most generous with a 1 for 10 bonus issue in Mar 24. It also gave 0.18c div (for 1H24) which is 10% of the 1H24 distributable income. It is keeping the 90% to show large potential tenants that they have strong balance sheet and probably also because it is building up cash to buy distressed assets.. Let's see if it will give another 1 for 10 bonus share in Mar 25.At about 18c  yield is  20% if it can sustain the distribution income  which I think is highly. Rental renewal in 1H24 is mere drop of -1.3% (Versus MUST of -10.5%) showing the rental resilience and its asset quality (note: also fr recent sale of OWT at only 3.3% discount fr book while MUST had to sell at 26% discount fr book valuation in Dec 23).It will lose about 6% income fr the absense of OWT it just sold but i think should be compensated by the increasing occupancy fr current avg of 84% to above 90% in 12 to 18 months fr other buildings but may be even earlier given a few indication:1) PUT's Park Tower (10.6% contribution in carrying value) may be close to increase occupancy fr 68.1% to 90%. This alone will add 2% income.2) A large tenant at Village Centre II (100% occupancy) is considering to take up a sizable space in Village Center I (55% occupancy).I see that we may enjoy full DPU (20% yield) by 1H 25 in 9 month time. Lets see how Q3 result looks like and we will know how fast ita recovers  and if we are moving in the correct direction. DYODD yah!Will add more if it comes down to next support at 17.4c. DYODD yah..Cheers,btohqsg

On the 27th Sept  MediLifestyle rallied from $0.012 to $0.014 but suddenly  there was an odd big single seller.Now  we know it’s because they sold off these guys shares to recoup back some $Do note that MediLifestyle is going after the seller of a biz that bought earlier on as the profit guarantee did not hit and if the legal side pursue of it works out  this seller shall have to make good of the shortfall equivalent to the profit target based at an issue price of $0.025.(Almost double of current price)Source:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/5N8MZ3CGO9O01WQ1/820821_Medi%20-%20Ann%20in%20relation%20to%20PG%20-%2020241002.pdf,btohqsg
ISOTeam had some crazy volume selling on Tuesday where most of the transactions was big sell down at $0.057. Yet  it cleared back $0.058 and closed $0.059 yesterday.Can tell that this counter is very cornered and controlled. Hence  if enter  best is to have that holding powered.For some who don’t know what cornered stock means. Usually it means there is some people who holds quite a big chunk of the counter and with that  is able to control the price of the stock price  whether up or down.Anyways  looks like they have broken out of the pressure line although there seems so many sellers selling done 58 and then 57 but yet it could recover easily could give a tell on the main directional bias.But DYODD,btohqsg

Need to understand market context as well as risk versus reward to make your buy/sell call. Check both ways as either you'll lose your pant if you don't know how to handle risk or lose big on opportunity when you can't see opportunities vs risk. One thing I learnt in investment and trading is don't fight against FED and BoC as they unleash tons of money to the market (opportunities) ...or shrink the money pool quickly (risk)Buy your desired investment position and use TA to trade to reduce your cost is one way I use. Eg in point  bought my first batch of 17Live at 45c as friends also thought its very high risk  and yet 3 months later now  it is >$1.1,btohqsg

The investing journey can be challenging  filled with ups and downs. It's important to remember that investing involves risk  and there's no guarantee of profits. However  the potential rewards can be significant.TA-BAO (Takeaways):• Long term perspective: Investing is often a long term endeavor. It's important to stay focused on your goals and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations.• Continuous learning: The investing landscape is constantly evolving  so it's essential to stay informed and continue learning.• Diversification: Spreading your investments across different asset classes can help manage risk and improve returns.• Emotional discipline: It's crucial to maintain emotional discipline and avoid making decisions based on fear or greed.• Market Sentiment: If you believe the market is overvalued or a correction is imminent  selling some of your gains might be prudent. Afterall money in your pocket never goes wrong.• Cut Your Losses: If an investment continues to underperform and you believe it's unlikely to recover  it might be time to cut your losses and reinvest the funds elsewhere.• Portfolio Rebalancing: Selling a gain or loss making investment can help rebalance your portfolio and maintain your desired asset allocation.These are just my personal opinions. It's always a good idea to do your own due diligence before making any financial commitments.Your investment success is personal. Don't get caught up in comparing yourself to others. Focus on building a portfolio that works for you.I'm not a financial guru  my aim is to generate some passive income to enjoy a more comfortable life.Stay safe  stay vested & stay huat. 🍍🍍,btohqsg

I'll be brutally honest  most of these stocks will probably never recover unless a pandemic like covid19 strike again  but whether it gonna be covid 29 or 59 nobody knows. Cut some if u need to cash for other purpose else medtec  Sri thang are still decent business generating profits no point in cutting at it's lowest. The rest I'm not too sure though I took a small cut loss on vicplas as well,btohqsg
