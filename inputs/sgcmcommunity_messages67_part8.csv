"Or upgrade big brake kit then still running normal tires thinking it will ""reduce braking distance""",btohqsg
😅😅😅...maybe sportivo ws his relative open,btohqsg
i think most surface level car enthusiast will assume BBK means shorter distance  but in actual it might increase braking distance under the wrong temperature,btohqsg

Idk leh  i just like the name haha,btohqsg
i see it quite alot la the sticker,btohqsg
maybe car owner is the dealer for tourador. promote his own brand,btohqsg
Bbk increases your brake thermal capacity and ability to have repeated stops. Just full of placebo to those surface level guys,btohqsg
but tourador I hearsay is quite a decent tyre for normal use.,btohqsg
I hear that tourador tyres are cheap and good. Is this true? For me I still prefer perelli or continental... I used run flat tyres because of frequent long road trip up north... but have mot done in the last 2 years  so my current tyres are just normal PZero,btohqsg
Uhhh  it really depends on ur risk appetite lor. PERSONALLY  i dont believe in using cheap tyres. cheap tyres will cause much more aquaplanning during wet weathers esp nowadays on the expressways. Heavy rain  stup!d drivers  i wld rather not take the risk and put on a budget tyre  might need to make evasive maneuvers.,btohqsg
I mean like clement said  tyres are the only point of contact to the road. If you lose traction then ur truly farked... bobian need open door use the slippers on ur feet to slow down liao,btohqsg

Wah thats new. I previously saw the white wagon with phv sticker,btohqsg
They go for good enough? While some uses good ones that help them achieve a smooth ride or good handling experience while driving,btohqsg
Yup when overheads are a major concern,btohqsg
I've been seeing Merc with phv sticker too,btohqsg
And strides limousines for premium cabs and chauffeur services,btohqsg
