Hi all want to ask1) Justgrab/grabcar/standard taxi(under grab app) all should be same MCC correct(4121)?2) If I link my amaze to services such as grab for direct payment to grab transport/food  is not under MCC excluded by both amaze and CRMC  so will not incur the 1% amaze fees right?(I know grab services is online and don't need amaze  but I'm doing this because I still have not hit the $1000 cap),btohqsg
as long as not over 1k amaze  wont incur fee,btohqsg
Hey people  for ocbc 360 account. I have maintained avg balance of 100 000 and got the 4.65% bonus. Calculated is $387.50  but the website stated $394.90.How did they get that number?,btohqsg
It could be because of the number of days of the month etc,btohqsg
At the bottom  got put 394.90 is calculated at 31 day basis,btohqsg
How does the number of days matter if the interest is calculated based on the maximum is 100k and if you can maintain the average of 100k?,btohqsg
One month earn 387.5 because  394.90 = 31 days  1 day = 12.70  1 year 365 days = 4649.6  1 month = 4649.6/12 = 387.50,btohqsg
Becus interest is calculated based on 365 days per year  $394.90 is 31 days  if u take 12 month is 372 days so is wrong,btohqsg
So we should be getting in the actual amount $387.50 every month as long as we maintained the 100k and criteria right?,btohqsg
OCBC website stated it is based on number of days as well,btohqsg
Depending on number of days in the month. Use the formulae provided and you can calculate yourself. For months with 28 days  the amount will be lesser  make sense?,btohqsg
387.50 is the amount u get on months such as April  June etc that has 30 days,btohqsg
On months with 28 days and 31 days  it will vary slightly,btohqsg
Interest earned is calculated daily.Account holder earns interest $4650/365 = $12.739 per day.You can calculate how many days in the month n how much you earn by using formula(num of days) X $12.739,btohqsg

UOB Big Savings Payout interest is in for those who credited in Apr.,btohqsg
oh just to update you   the bill came out to be 65.1  for scaling and polishing,btohqsg
Wrong. Interest calculation is same as UOB One account interest.Base interest is calculated daily. 0.05% p.a. Ã— end of day balance.Bonus interest is calculated at end of month  based on average daily balance. Eligible bonus interest % p.a. Ã— average daily balance.But ultimately the base interest calculated is negligible as it's a flat 0.05% p.a. for all amounts  so if your average daily balance is 100k  even with any fluctuation  it should still be 100k Ã— 0.05% p.a.,btohqsg
My answer is referring to OP question of $100k MAB.,btohqsg
Still  bonus interest is not calculated daily. Only base interest is.,btohqsg

Guys and ladies.Team cash back vs air milesWho you think will win,btohqsg
Team use whatever cards is suitable for your lifestyle.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/200052,btohqsg
Yes agree bro... I got a feeling that team miles may win,btohqsg
Your card due date is always based on your statement date. You can check with CSO on UOB chat assist for your statement date.,btohqsg
I mean if only 1 person votes on his own poll  the side he votes will always win. ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
