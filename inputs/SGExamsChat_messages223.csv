Probably going to try for ba but that sounds like 90rp course now LOL,btohqsg
I rmb seeing pharmacy as like a 85 course,btohqsg
Looks like I dont even need to try for nus :'),btohqsg
Hello. Those who achieved A1 for English  are yâ€™all able to share how did u manage to do it?,btohqsg
Didnâ€™t you take o levels already?,btohqsg
When ppl realise pharmacy is not high paying or as stable an iron rice bowl as perceived,btohqsg
According to my teacher  I screwed up compre and according to the answer sheet  I screwed up listening compre.I'm pretty sure paper 1 and oral saved me,btohqsg
How does your teacher know you screwed up paper 1,btohqsg
Uh she asked me how I answered,btohqsg
there's no definite way to actually know haha,btohqsg
Idk I'm pretty sure I screwed it up thou.,btohqsg
HAHHA IGP LIKE ALL 10 POINTS HIGHER THAN MY SCORE SIA,btohqsg
can both of yall come back mi,btohqsg
r u interested in seeing it,btohqsg
My favourite math teacher gone from mi already,btohqsg
So no point coming back :'),btohqsg
cause aba admitted ppl are included in igp,btohqsg
Like u apply under aba they sit u through an interview for it ah,btohqsg
Or do they just add on to the rest of the app,btohqsg
But if u meet the cutoff,btohqsg
Then aba got any use anot,btohqsg
anyways IGP is not a cut off,btohqsg
so there might still be ppl who got lower than what's shown,btohqsg
u can say that I suppose?,btohqsg
Yes milo senpai give me hope,btohqsg
imagine cohort is 100 ppl  10th percentile is the score of the 10th guy from the bottom,btohqsg
ppl keep saying it's cut off  which tbh isn't even true for sec sch to JC/poly,btohqsg
I mean I guess I can attest to that,btohqsg
Its just a gauge.SMU Econs 70 for 10th percentile  i got rejected with 70+God knows,btohqsg
Few points off some courses I applied for  still offered interview,btohqsg
But obviously big flunk on the interviews HAHAHA,btohqsg
5 points off for a course... got accepted,btohqsg
smu apps consider your Q&A stuff also,btohqsg
so if someone below u wrote sth stronger and have strong credentials then theyâ€™ll get in,btohqsg
Someone 7 rp below me woohoo,btohqsg
Haha my English cher was like who on earth reads books like that now  need to stamp the date or sth (paper 2) then she say LC is tough also,btohqsg
what are some uni courses that I can go to,btohqsg
Further math is not a prerequisite for any course in uni,btohqsg
so by taking it is just for fun?,btohqsg
It helps for courses like engineering math and computing  cause you learn some of the y1 uni math content in further math,btohqsg
But for prerequisite wise its useless so yea its only for ppl w interest,btohqsg
o lol sit first time with igp,btohqsg
Is it worth to appeal if I got D7 for English? Cuz this was very unexpected but I achieved C5 for my prelim..,btohqsg
with a d7 English you cannot go a lot of places,btohqsg
Will my English grade affect any university admission?,btohqsg
JC is all about that GP,btohqsg
Hi guys  do yall think i shd try to go sajc even though my net l1r5 is 11? I missed by 1 point,btohqsg
Hope for COP this year to increase by 1,btohqsg
i saw the cut off point and it has been consistently 10,btohqsg
The damn o level AM paper,btohqsg
Can i appeal if i dun get in,btohqsg
Can i use by chem A1 to appeal in for sci,btohqsg
Ah usually appealing is for when u don't get in despite having met the necessary COP,btohqsg
But who knows  maybe cop for sajc will rise,btohqsg
okay ah gt some good chers,btohqsg
imo whichever sch u enter  ultimately it's the people you choose to mingle with that matter HAHAH,btohqsg
I think they moderated it a lot tbh,btohqsg
Isit possible to get in by arts then switch to sci,btohqsg
I mean ik like even ppl who get f9 can get a pass to b4,btohqsg
I didnt expect my school to get 50% dist.,btohqsg
Wait till u come my sch,btohqsg
EH HOW WAS UR SCH ECONS,btohqsg
Mine 100% dist so i rlly did drop for a service,btohqsg
If appeal means recount your marks then My teacher said in her decades of teaching there were no students who appealed and got a change of grade,btohqsg
From my experience last year they dont allow you to appeal if you dont meet the cop,btohqsg
Do i stand a chance if i got A1 for pure chem and i wanna take sci,btohqsg
When you apply to the sch through jae they ignore everything and look at your l1r5 nett,btohqsg
And then raw if youre fighting for a place,btohqsg
If i d7 for english must i retake,btohqsg
Like in uni do they see english,btohqsg
It depends on where u want to go,btohqsg
Does ur course allow for it?,btohqsg
Then maybe retaking it might be something u want to consider just to be safe when it comes to Uni application,btohqsg
My friend told me uni need a b4 in o lvl if you wanna go FASS nus or ntu,btohqsg
I really dw to take el again,btohqsg
Lol honestly I kinda enjoyed English,btohqsg
but i got a decent grade,btohqsg
I preferred paper 2 to 1,btohqsg
2 was a shitshow for me,btohqsg
It was the opposite for me,btohqsg
actl same la i didnt do that shit and a few others still got c5,btohqsg
first time being able to do math,btohqsg
Some courses have reqs like 'either C in H2 XYZ or a B3 in O level XYZ',btohqsg
Was compulsory at my sch up until last year,btohqsg
hi my frend last yr do os then his geog c5 then he retake then now he get c6 so will they tske the c5 or c6,btohqsg
oh the person posted before right?,btohqsg
the fees font should be less than 10,btohqsg
Itâ€™s for those who take Alevel Econs if they need help the rest doesnâ€™t have to care about it,btohqsg
I get nothing since itâ€™s not my tuition,btohqsg
We don't care whose tuition you are advertising,btohqsg
You come here you follow the rules,btohqsg
For Nanyang H2 Computing  what is the test about?,btohqsg
Its to test u if u can hack into the Pentagon,btohqsg
Yes is true  im the h2 paoer. Can affirm that,btohqsg
do the polyâ€™s look at our individual grades of diff subjects when admitting us or overall points,btohqsg
and when does cca points come in,btohqsg
idk brother i'm pretty sure just overall pts tho,btohqsg
as long as u meet the minimum entry requirements  they'll only look at overall score,btohqsg
overall net score  which means raw score minus cca points,btohqsg
also js to confirm form A shows raw score right?,btohqsg
bc if its net then idek what to say HAHAHA,btohqsg
Anyone choosing ITE instead of Poly?,btohqsg
Funny thing is he can go jc aso but he choosing ite,btohqsg
can go jc means can go p gd poly course what right,btohqsg
He cannot go alot of course,btohqsg
apparently if ur l1r5 lower than 15 u can get conditional offer,btohqsg
Waste time one the e seminar,btohqsg
science courses got content but like not rly focused on english language right,btohqsg
but u must work hard if not ur gonna be dropped out lor,btohqsg
Why his friend cmi go poly,btohqsg
He had a gap year 2020,btohqsg
Wah now the system so good,btohqsg
My time the pper like retarded af,btohqsg
I had no idea whats going on so many numbers one hahaha,btohqsg
@njeilsonso wai he cannot go poly,btohqsg
I not from moe one ah hahaah i cannot comment,btohqsg
Then I send u the details llr,btohqsg
Got people failed emath but got into eae poly?,btohqsg
It depends on the poly lor,btohqsg
If they received this then lucky,btohqsg
How it is that this was the best olevel yet but most of them I see failed emath,btohqsg
Hola   holaU try seeing any issue w this,btohqsg
If I got nett 5 and want to enter NYJC (science)  should I still put art as my second choice to be safe?,btohqsg
Hi guys where to do the Jae??,btohqsg
Just use the envelope they give you have jae pin,btohqsg
Or use singpass log in also can,btohqsg
Go to the moe jae website,btohqsg
Is the O level result slip important?,btohqsg
Oh my teacher forgot to give us,btohqsg
Hello. Must i pay $115+ for appeal for English Language if I am a school candidate?,btohqsg
that one still need pay  sch doesn't cover,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s the likelihood that grades will change?,btohqsg
Cuz my prelim C5 than O level D7,btohqsg
best case scenario is slim  worst case scenario is you're wasting your money,btohqsg
I checked mine for both psle and o level  nothing change hahaha,btohqsg
Wtf how can your teacher forget to give the result slip!??!,btohqsg
And how come none of u guys noticed it,btohqsg
We thought that the cert was all they gave us,btohqsg
But for private candidates taking EL  how did yâ€™all practice for LC?,btohqsg
Anybody got photos of wet market ðŸ¥º,btohqsg
I canâ€™t take from the web ðŸ¥º,btohqsg
Then go there take yourself la,btohqsg
Need photos from the past ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I used the LC books from popular 2 years ago,btohqsg
Ah I see.. is there any way that I can get past years O level LC?,btohqsg
Eg. Recording and the paper itself,btohqsg
I'm like 10 minutes away lol,btohqsg
anyone here good at hardware stuff and home repairs,btohqsg
what can I use to patch a pressurised plastic tank,btohqsg
tried epoxy putty for underwater application but it always leaks again after two days,btohqsg
For the 12 choices  is it put the course that I really want to enrol in as my first choice?,btohqsg
but if the cop too far off no point  if u meet it or 1/2 points away just try lot,btohqsg
Do you think the cop will remain the same this year?,btohqsg
I think law and management will become lower this yr,btohqsg
A lot of ppl arnd me wanna go,btohqsg
Ur bad experience does not necessarily mean others will have a bad time too,btohqsg
Wish i did something like business or something,btohqsg
Yeah its an opinion of course,btohqsg
Besides  perhaps proper use of English may have benefited.,btohqsg
Objectively tho  lots and lots of reading,btohqsg
"Ur phrase of ""pls avoid"" does not reflect that",btohqsg
I have a few friends tried to eae for law,btohqsg
In the end non got an interview even,btohqsg
Ur phrasing does not reflect it as an opinion,btohqsg
I really dont think its justified how selective it is,btohqsg
I am saying u could have said it better,btohqsg
I am not in a position of authority  and the informal tone implies so  so it cannot be considered instructions by a reasonable person. Any misinterpretation is therefore purely subjective,btohqsg
If law dont have a lot of readings  then is not law le,btohqsg
But a diploma in law and management from poly doesnt allow u to be a lawyer  still need to pursue further/higher studies,btohqsg
Generally no  it allows you to be paralegal,btohqsg
Or if you just bo liao,btohqsg
You need to get into a uni as a criteria to get the bar,btohqsg
I think if your intention is to practise  then uni is the only way,btohqsg
anyone here in the 2021 pre budget youth conversations zoom?,btohqsg
Can I ask who is handling the sgexamshelp gmail account?,btohqsg
The post was removed by moderators but I managed to screenshot it,btohqsg
all emails from sgexams will come from emails ending in@exams.sg,btohqsg
we have a gmail account but it's not used to send or receive emails from community members,btohqsg
the website ah? we use digitalocean to host it for now,btohqsg
we got an instance on digitalocean  everything hosted there for now,btohqsg
this part is like pattern recognition  math sense  logic,btohqsg
this one is supposedly test your character?,btohqsg
got like 7-8 mini games I think,btohqsg
I havenâ€™t touch math for 2 years,btohqsg
Did u get back ur results,btohqsg
idk how much this thing matters for psc though lol,btohqsg
but poly getting psc scholarship is so damn rare,btohqsg
you go see the past recipients on the psc website,btohqsg
I only aiming for ministry scholarship lol,btohqsg
psc and ministry scholarship is apply through psc portal,btohqsg
5 peeps from poly gets psc,btohqsg
Max gpa from poly is 4 0.0,btohqsg
u can start applying this year October onwards,btohqsg
my gpa is v near 4,btohqsg
my lec marked me down cuz i did the project by myself,btohqsg
when no one canâ€™t be bothered to do,btohqsg
Eh you ask me about the course before you join remember hahaha,btohqsg
oh wait I just saw that soz,btohqsg
Now sport sci like cut off points quite high ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Only sch w sports sci i think,btohqsg
I think they take in more eae,btohqsg
The courses COP getting lower and lower every year,btohqsg
Cos i think recent batch do very well and also many jc students jump over,btohqsg
My batch got a handful of jc already students jump ship,btohqsg
Ya also many jc eligible students join sports sci,btohqsg
Can poly students take private A at the same time,btohqsg
Is rp the only poly offering sports sci?,btohqsg
though idk why would you do that,btohqsg
idk if im correct but i think theres no criteria to take private A,btohqsg
so technically u can grad at 18,btohqsg
plus they have no academic requirements,btohqsg
i rmb got some girl at cambridge graduated at 19 and got the bar at like 21,btohqsg
she did her a levels at like 16 or something,btohqsg
I pm u holy shit HAHAHA,btohqsg
things that i agree but i cannot say in public,btohqsg
kena stomp or some shit i cry,btohqsg
can but its difficult enough as it is for students studying for A levels full time. Would be better to go to a JC if possible,btohqsg
but if you were really determined  its possible,btohqsg
emphasis on the difficult part so you gotta make a good choice bro,btohqsg
Anyone from njc  can tell me what time does sch usually end?,btohqsg
if u take BCME/PCME/GELM/HELM likely that youll end earlier,btohqsg
PCME is what time end ah,btohqsg
not fixed but prob before 3?,btohqsg
on wed everyone ends at 330 tho,btohqsg
probably??i cant give u a definite answer tho it rly depends on ur timetable,btohqsg
If you don't mind me asking  is the phy dept in nj good?,btohqsg
hi is the science dept in tjc good?,btohqsg
Turnover of teachers in JC is pretty high... hence  even if the best dept.. really depends on whether the good educators are still there..,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve a sibling there taking pcme and heâ€™s doing very well,btohqsg
ohh i see! im looking more on bio,btohqsg
hi guys  if we submitted our jae choices we can amend it bfr fri 4pm right?,btohqsg
and if we amend will there be a confirmation email sent or sth bc man i gotta resort to that but idw get into too much deep shit,btohqsg
bc my dad linked my email to his since i was born so im practically screwed,btohqsg
"They will say smth like ""you have make ammendment""",btohqsg
U still can access it tho,btohqsg
will they show the amendments haha,btohqsg
do yall know how to unlink a linked email to urs,btohqsg
Since when JC is being charge as adult fare,btohqsg
im only 17 i dont know anyth but i know idw to start sch on 29 jan,btohqsg
does anyone know if its possible to study for a uni degree while in prison?,btohqsg
I think you're pushing it a little too far,btohqsg
iirc  you get charged adult fare until you start JC?,btohqsg
after which the prices go back to student,btohqsg
But I just graduated from IB...,btohqsg
i think for sec4s and 5s(?) this year we can use until jan 2021 but yea now expired alr,btohqsg
I know you can do up to A levels in prison,btohqsg
im just thinking abt how he or she will find grp mates for grp projects ...,btohqsg
but havent heard of anyone doing a degree course in prison,btohqsg
thrs prison sch but i guess it rly depends on availability,btohqsg
theyâ€™ll collect ur card in jc,btohqsg
okay mine was to like allow us to tap into sch so,btohqsg
but like theres a small process to get ur card into student again,btohqsg
if i remember its sch handle,btohqsg
i remember i had to go tap it at the top up machine?,btohqsg
what do ppl think of subject based banding?,btohqsg
Well  given that I was the last batch before the pilot programme was launched  I can see that my juniors benefit much from it.,btohqsg
They mentioned how they garner much from the subjects which they are better suited for.,btohqsg
like ppl who are originally from na nt mixing with express kids,btohqsg
Personal experience of mixing with students from such an initiative I think its ok tbh. Only problem is there may be a divide  and the teacher may be slightly biased against them.,btohqsg
like instead of having nt na classes separate,btohqsg
divide as in the express ppl dont rly mix with the na nt ppl,btohqsg
like got 1 class i taught out of 40 ppl  only 2 were from na,btohqsg
and in general students from nt who are not so motivated to do well academically  by mixing with express kids  perhaps they get positively influenced,btohqsg
so your form class  has a mixture of academic abilities,btohqsg
instead of previously where all nt is one class  all na is one class  all express is one class,btohqsg
sbb just basically only affects the class for that particular subject,btohqsg
so for example class A has 40 students and all of them take pure chem,btohqsg
so form class still consists of all na/nt/express students?,btohqsg
but for their pure chem class there may be 2 NA students joining them,btohqsg
that's not how my sch works now though,btohqsg
for the sec sch i interned in  it was like that,btohqsg
it's legit a mixture of express  na  and nt kids,btohqsg
i guess each school has their own implementation,btohqsg
my sec sch did it that way too,btohqsg
like half my class take g2 level  then half takes g3,btohqsg
this is for sec 1s ah,btohqsg
then for their lessons they go to separate classrooms?,btohqsg
so instead of having like 5 express classes  3 na classes and 1 nt class per cohort,btohqsg
now we have 9 classes with mixed abilities,btohqsg
hows syllabus compared to h2 math,btohqsg
Im planning to replace chem for fmath,btohqsg
does it sync with h2 math or what,btohqsg
hows the jump frm h2 math to h2 fm?,btohqsg
so maybe for a class of 40  20 is express  16 is na level  4 is nt level,btohqsg
how many schools are trying out this SBB thing uh,btohqsg
oh then rolled out to all sec sch in 2024,btohqsg
I think what you and Jay experience is non full sbb,btohqsg
now my school is full sbb,btohqsg
so maybe that's why like that,btohqsg
Huh since when tm bans bcme?,btohqsg
Bcme is the most basic combi,btohqsg
ya true  under the old pilot program must have been like that,btohqsg
Cant be one of the top sec sch in sg do sbb weirdly,btohqsg
Bcme is the sidekick of pcme,btohqsg
every JC's cop has a chance of increasing by 1,btohqsg
So i guess is different methods,btohqsg
no yours should be the non full sbb,btohqsg
Just seeing the 50 organic reactions makes me want to look away,btohqsg
cos my sec 2/3/4 also same as yours,btohqsg
some na students take express subjects,btohqsg
ironic that i didnt get a1 for amath and got a1 for chem,btohqsg
No one says u need to learn all of them instantly,btohqsg
then some nt students take na subjects,btohqsg
Better dont study chem in uni,btohqsg
true also  but generally seems more likely to increase,btohqsg
remember that each batch of o level students is small than the last,btohqsg
still just seeing the 50 reactions makes me say no,btohqsg
Suggest the major product formed when phenol reacts with ClCOCH2CH2COCl and AlCl3 (2 tsp),btohqsg
I forgot if you still want to be a cher or you dw liao,btohqsg
but the JCs have the same number of places  but with possibly fewer students applying,btohqsg
what subject did u intern for ah,btohqsg
you intern as uni kid right,btohqsg
If intern as uni i could have interned at a jc,btohqsg
o u still y2 uni ah,btohqsg
the jctip do you front classes?,btohqsg
Well  unfortunately  when Full SBB was launched  I had graduated secondary school.,btohqsg
@jianjun21how is the bellcurve for your courses ? Is it ridiculously high like 90% and above for everything just to get A-,btohqsg
Every course is equally steep  aside from engineering,btohqsg
It depends on the difficulty of the mod also. If every1 does badly  the cut off to get A- and above decreases. If every1 does well  the cut off to get A- and above consequently increases.,btohqsg
I got 90% for a mod and got an A.Another mod i got probably about 85-86% and it was an A+.,btohqsg
I'm trying to find notes for hook and eye stories from the margin but apparently my school is bastard and picked a book which has no history. . .,btohqsg
Can someone tell me  to get scholarship in uni  what do i need to do? Esp what to do in jc.,btohqsg
study a H3 subject  get 90rp  work on your portfolio,btohqsg
What do i need to do for my portfolio?,btohqsg
Do well academically (of cos) and represent in as many competitions as u can in CCAs,btohqsg
holistic development lor. stuff outside of academics. volunteering  sports  competitions  etc,btohqsg
Yes and volunteer for sch events,btohqsg
not v useful unless you're P/VP,btohqsg
If studied h3 subj get 90 rp and have a meh portfolio  what r the chances of getting scholarship tho?,btohqsg
depends on what scholarship lor I think,btohqsg
those super upz ones still need portfolio,btohqsg
tbh I know someone who got like almost 90 without H3 but w super upz portfolio but still get scholarship,btohqsg
and is a quite good scholarship,btohqsg
Wait guys is mtl only for 1 year for jc,btohqsg
im sec 4 this year but how can i take h3 subjects when i go jc,btohqsg
different sch different requirement haha I aso not sure,btohqsg
Do well in J1 promos and meet whatever requirements the JC sets,btohqsg
Then they'll invite u/u request to take H3,btohqsg
The requirements can be pretty flexible  it's up to the H3 in charge teacher to take u or not,btohqsg
You can always get easy sponsorship from SAF,btohqsg
That one need serve extra year right?,btohqsg
i think like 5 year contract,btohqsg
govt money not so easy hahaha need to sign your soul away for some time,btohqsg
2 yrs of NS is part of the 5 yrs,btohqsg
But they do give out the sponsorships like candy  so if u really want,btohqsg
Anybody know any research methods for polytechnic?,btohqsg
Iâ€™m going to a dang competitive course,btohqsg
Need every advantage I can get because I want a 3.9 GPA,btohqsg
you want to research on your modules is it?,btohqsg
Like conducting research for coursework and all that,btohqsg
go your school website see the modules for your course,btohqsg
ask lecturers which are the reference texts for your modules,btohqsg
gob-ok.ccor libgen to find the books,btohqsg
when you do your tutorial  don't just rely on lecture notes,btohqsg
make use of the reference texts also,btohqsg
not every single person in a group aims for an A,btohqsg
so if you want an A  you have to make sure all the work is A standard,btohqsg
get fully acquainted with google scholar  pubmed  and whatever other search engines your sch subscribes to,btohqsg
learn to google for research papers using relevant keywords,btohqsg
