Bro u need to read the fine print there's like a 2.5k cap,btohqsg
i literally didn’t say anything except show ss,btohqsg
Tian wang got his own album,btohqsg
Tianwang passed Tututu O level subjects but I only passed one : (,btohqsg
I think I found the calculation5k GrossFEDR 35%Net earnings ->(1-0.35) x 5000 = 3.25kEmployee contribution -> 341.25Platform contribution -> 113.75,btohqsg
But then your parents need to write in iirc,btohqsg
u got so much time ah,btohqsg
like drop out of mainstream sch due to health issues or like other reasons,btohqsg
and must be valid reason la,btohqsg
Genuinely interested lmao Labour policy is one of my funny side shit I do,btohqsg
The history of labour policy is an interesting topic tbh,btohqsg
can tell my industry to increase pay thanks,btohqsg
No but here's a pizza party,btohqsg
Noted with thanks.Eh if I don't accept means he cannot resign rite?/s,btohqsg
Also I just realised those idiots who want CPF contributions FEDR is the income tax,btohqsg
Before the I am pretty sure gig income doesn't fall under the taxable assemble income for IRAS,btohqsg
i shld know this cause im learning tax but i dont listen in class,btohqsg
So the new system yes will have cpf contributions but u need to declare. Which means u get taxed 35% off what u declare.,btohqsg
Eh shit if it's 5k per month cmi for the calculation The delivery worker’s total annual gross income from delivery servicesdoes not exceed $50 000  regardless of the delivery mode(s) used;,btohqsg
he cannot afford to fall sick,btohqsg
I think now harder to earn,btohqsg
And more ppl wfh  now all go office no one wan order food delivery,btohqsg
yes will be harder. Grab will slowly reduce incentives as they look towards making profits for shareholders,btohqsg
and 5k is not particularly high for the work. I think the article is just trying to say that in SG  if you work hard you will survive,btohqsg
High for a pri drop out but,btohqsg
I ever met someone who lost his job and complained he can only earn 1.5k as a odd job labourerI asked him why don't do grab delivery  he just say don't have money buy a bicycle.,btohqsg
the clown looks a little off,btohqsg
they will say cycling helps their health,btohqsg
which for one personal friend of mine  cycling for grab delivery after he was retrenched helped him lose so much weight that his diabetes was beaten into remission,btohqsg
Especially cuz it is a publicly traded company.. Grab rn is still hemorrhaging money although this quarter is their first time I saw a positive net income lmao,btohqsg
they need consecutive quarters of it.They go into so many areas and all areas face stiff competition,btohqsg
Still it's like 35M off 653M of top line revenue for Q4 2023,btohqsg
Bruh tbvh I ain't even sure if the model is even profitable.. UBER and Door Dash all are great examples of it not even making much money lol,btohqsg
Grab has 1 potential only  GXS bank,btohqsg
It's like Shopee tryna to do it with Maribank lor,btohqsg
shopee still trying to depend on their FreeFire game,btohqsg
But I highly doubt its good enough to a counteract the cyclical flows that a bank has and b compete with entrenched players,btohqsg
Maybe provide them with more cash flow? But even that is dubious cuz they gotta maintain CET ratios still for they have to comply under SDIC,btohqsg
Yeah but the entrenched players are also seeing and capitalizing on that potential as well. See UOB and Fairprice with Trust Bank,btohqsg
not wrong  I don't know enough that's why didn't buy in,btohqsg
or at most if buy in will just chip in small amt,btohqsg
cannot sell skillset sell health lor,btohqsg
I am just always skeptical tbh but these kinda ventures for now is always lost making,btohqsg
even if u see quarters of profitability,btohqsg
Anyone put money into trust bank?,btohqsg
