PAP is the gospel here ðŸ˜¡,btohqsg
Heâ€™s working as an anti-pap to smear the name of anti-paps,btohqsg
You may not agree with the PAP all the time  but you cannot disagree that PAP is the best option for Singaporeans,btohqsg
There needs to be a new party that has actual liberal views,btohqsg
All the parties like the same must as well vote pap,btohqsg
The values of a party reflect the values of a population,btohqsg
Liberalism is a luxury  people don't care about free expression and truth if they're having trouble to have their 3 meals a day,btohqsg
If there was demand for liberals there would be liberals,btohqsg
Well theres a huge aging population=more conservative,btohqsg
Poverty is tucked away from society's view,btohqsg
So what we gotta wait 20-30 years?,btohqsg
Clearly someone doesnâ€™t live in a neighbourhood estate,btohqsg
Just wait until the covid situation is over,btohqsg
Life expectancy is increasing  so make it 30-40 years,btohqsg
Just pray that there's no age extension serum developed in the next few decades,btohqsg
Longer age expectancy means retirement age becomes like 90!,btohqsg
I mean they intake abiut 20000 slaves per year,btohqsg
WOAH WOAH  let's not go there,btohqsg
They can expand to 40000 if they want to be progressive about gender equality,btohqsg
Let us go there and serve the nation,btohqsg
Is the reason why the govt dw do ns for all because theyre scared to lose votes,btohqsg
Let's extend ROD as well  while we're at it,btohqsg
They dont need to do ns for all they can just make life in ns better,btohqsg
1) Lee Kuan Yew believed that childbearing is national service (although that's faulty logic imo)2) Infrastructural changes to accommodate a NS which is 2x as large as the present3) Women's physical needs (they're weaker  have mensuration),btohqsg
1) as you said flawed logic2) Very valid point but they do not have to do so instantly. They can do something like 'we will begin to renovate our infrastructure and in the near future it will be capable of holding national service for all genders'3) That has not stopped countries like israel. These needs can be accomodated through various ways. For example physical strength. Not every guy in ns is buff ippt gold when he enters. They all had to train to be combat fit. Same can be applied to women.,btohqsg
But point 2 is very valid and i have never heard anyone bring that up before,btohqsg
1) Maybe it should officially be made NS,btohqsg
Go bukit timah rented apartments and see the horrors,btohqsg
I've always never understood the line of reasoning for HDB grants,btohqsg
If you're giving the grants to heterosexual couples because you want them to have children give the grant after they bear the child,btohqsg
Otherwise heterosexual couples are no different from LGBT couples,btohqsg
I heard something like how they dont support single parents too,btohqsg
Not sure how true it is,btohqsg
There arenâ€™t any LGBT couples officially,btohqsg
If you don't legalize LGBT couples,btohqsg
They technically don't exist  in the eye of the law,btohqsg
This is why we need a liberal party,btohqsg
i think can wait long long,btohqsg
I'm a proponent for women serving NS  I just don't have enough expertise to do it in a realistic way,btohqsg
And do keep it mind  we are still a very patriarchal society,btohqsg
We can ask for help from our old friend Israel,btohqsg
"Some men would have the mindset ""I don't need women to protect me""",btohqsg
It's an illegitimate stance but people have it regardless,btohqsg
The ministers do but it isnt in their best interest to do so,btohqsg
Until you tell them that their reservist can cut by 5 cycles,btohqsg
I would think that it only applies to older generation but not gonna deny other guys my age think that too,btohqsg
Iâ€™m a strong independent man who donâ€™t need no woman,btohqsg
How did israel successfully do their national setvice,btohqsg
Oh  another practical consideration was that women serving NS would essentially double the cost of NS  and the military already eats a good majority of our national budget how would we tackle this issue?There are many ways of course  but this is just the start of the problem,btohqsg
I think all these problems can be addressed  but the thing is  making women serve NS isn't even in the back of the mind of most people,btohqsg
