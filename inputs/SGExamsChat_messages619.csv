hi yall  i got my a level results alr. i’m currently working in a govt job p high entry pay ig. just slightly higher than a fresh grad  but i don’t think it has any form of career progression. i discussed w my parents how i wanna quit my contract early to go to uni in august  my parents told me ystdy they just want me to stay in the job as it was hard to get in  w all the entry tests and stuff. they glorify the job a lot and they don’t intend to send me to uni( obv im broke as fuck rn so i only can rely on them at this point of time). i’m v devastated  i feel like this job destroyed my uni path  actually wanted to retake my exams as i didn’t score to well either  but that’s too much cost so tbh fr now im js fine gg to any local uni that accepts me. but rn even local uni they also not keen on me going. idw to stay my whole life as an A level grad only. does anyone have any advice for me/ suggestions of loans i can take to pay uni for myself in the future? any input would be greatly appreciated !,btohqsg
this guy is one of them fyi,btohqsg
yeah that’s why i rlly feel like getting a govt job backfired on me,btohqsg
