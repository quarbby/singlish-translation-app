U CANT USE ECONS TO REPLACE COMB HUMANS.,btohqsg
im gonna take h2 econs for sure,btohqsg
i js hope i can even make it to jc now,btohqsg
although i think econs prob easier to score a1 as compared to phy,btohqsg
now i cant even take a bridging course if i want to take a phy related course in uni,btohqsg
but bio to physics i think its a lot harder,btohqsg
chances r very low even if i take h2 phy,btohqsg
1. parents need to approve2. school need to approve3. need to self study o lvl pure phy in 3 months4. continue dying in jc....,btohqsg
for chem i think i might go with h2 first... but maybe drop to h1 if i rly cmi...,btohqsg
coz my chem foundation q weak,btohqsg
YA MR KANG JS LEFT SUDDENLY SIA,btohqsg
I MEAN YEAH HIS LESSONS ARE BORING AF,btohqsg
BUT BETTER THAN MR LIM... (like i understand mr lim teaching method is q useful coz it forces students to use active recall BUT im not used to it since WE SUDDENLY CHANGE TCHR),btohqsg
I think q hard to self study in 3 months la,btohqsg
"""i was so glad i can take a break from teaching graduating students but now i have to teach again"" or smth along those lines...",btohqsg
true idk also i most likely gonna stick with h2 bio,btohqsg
plus not all the schs allow students to take h2 phy without prior o lvl knowledge ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
they say frm combi sci to h2 sci is alr hard,btohqsg
then if u hv 0 knowledge gg liao,btohqsg
i got one friend didnt do Bio in Sec sch  den go JC take H2 Bio H2 Chem,btohqsg
have to request and all i think was ASRJC,btohqsg
i mean i have phy o level textbook...,btohqsg
but if i doesnt work out then ill js accept my fate to do h2 bio LMAO,btohqsg
i dont think my parents will allow me to take also,btohqsg
coz my dad quite against me going to jc in the first place ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
i think he will actually kill me,btohqsg
he thinks im more suited for poly,btohqsg
and that i cant make it in jc,btohqsg
"then he also mentions how much my brother struggled in jc  let alone me who is ""less smart"" as compared to him",btohqsg
idk maybe coz i like arts and humanities better,btohqsg
doesnt really matter to me anymkre,btohqsg
i have no idea if this is a scammer or a bored person,btohqsg
he told my brother the same thing about how,btohqsg
he wont make it in sec sch  in jc  in ns  in uni,btohqsg
i considered it... but i think to bridge the gap from elect hist to h2 hist is quite huge...,btohqsg
my most likely subj combi id have to take is HELM,btohqsg
h2 lit is a nightmare and my english tchr advised not to take it LMAO,btohqsg
my english not that strong in the first place,btohqsg
is it abt the gp or sth,btohqsg
for now... i think ill prob stick with BCME,btohqsg
if i cant make it to sci stream,btohqsg
maybe hybrid or HELM (idk about h2 lit tho),btohqsg
if i cant make it to jc then poly,btohqsg
i havent thought about what courses to take,btohqsg
i thought of taking h2 hist and geog,btohqsg
but i think thats also crazy,btohqsg
