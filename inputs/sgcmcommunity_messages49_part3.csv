i think if u buy those 40km shld be not driven yet so either display or events carp,btohqsg
which car you looking at leh,btohqsg
Oooo. It's a big discount from new set. But is from 2nd hand dealer,btohqsg
should be fine just new batt plus maybe new tires,btohqsg
see how long ago the car was reg,btohqsg
this can be nego in terms of price,btohqsg
But if the tires look new?,btohqsg
sure. if the price is a steal,btohqsg
uhh if car not moving  the tires will harden,btohqsg
how much the disc over new,btohqsg
u btr buy now before other ppl come steal,btohqsg
are you sure 60k discount? from a demo car?,btohqsg
Definitely better than other 2nd hand right? My other choice is an Audi Q5 2018,btohqsg
The issue is i see got about 10+ cars on sgcarmart with similar specs,btohqsg
u see which one u like better,btohqsg
Got so many display sets meh,btohqsg
Q5 bigger and better equipped imo,btohqsg
Display sets is it usually at BMW showrooms only? Or have other places also,btohqsg
sometimes have at shopping malls etc,btohqsg
-60k is not issue at all,btohqsg
Like is there so many display seys?,btohqsg
As long not scam can alr,btohqsg
display sets could be demo car,btohqsg
i think itâ€™s really not bad,btohqsg
had the 2018 20i for awhile,btohqsg
it maybe the reason. difficult to sell,btohqsg
but u ask me choose Q5 vs X1 i choose Q5,btohqsg
i had one i really feel is a good car  decent legroom  bootspace and 190hp more then enough,btohqsg
but ya i still think q5 interior better hahahahhaa,btohqsg
Was thinking changing after 3 years. Do people normally buy cars that have about 3 to 4 years left on COE?,btohqsg
people will see badge and buy,btohqsg
Oooo. Even if left a few years,btohqsg
Badge you mean the brand right?,btohqsg
haha i know of someone who wanted prestige and bought a scirocco with two years left,btohqsg
I prefer the Q5. But the 60k discount on X1 seems like a steal ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
i kid u not within a week it broke down,btohqsg
could be the employees drive home some haha,btohqsg
ive been doing this for the past few cars. Buy 1 or less year old and then sell exactly at 3,btohqsg
i think itâ€™s a perk in some companies,btohqsg
you will lose the least money,btohqsg
and still have enough to downpay the next car,btohqsg
I see. Do you do that every 2 years?,btohqsg
i sell and collect every 3 years on 1st aprilðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
idk why also but alw april fools,btohqsg
come back w diff car people think i joking with them,btohqsg
Idk if u trolling or notðŸ¤¨-R,btohqsg
i dont mind show you my old car listing,btohqsg
Do you go to same 2nd hand dealer?,btohqsg
nope i buy from wearnes new,btohqsg
haha wah i think for the price diff between the 20i  the 20i MAY be more worth,btohqsg
