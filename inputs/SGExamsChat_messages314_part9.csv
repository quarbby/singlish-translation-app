Just passed by BTT today. Anyone knows how come my BTT records are not reflected in my SSDC account ?,btohqsg
If you passed BTT go to traffic police website go apply for your pdl,btohqsg
And when I apply my PDLâ€¦using ENets than they say payment failed,btohqsg
Oh the traffic police website fucked,btohqsg
Have to try a few times,btohqsg
It took me like 5 tries to get it to work,btohqsg
Try 2 times and have to wait for 30minutes haiz,btohqsg
Iirc paying by credit / Debit card is faster,btohqsg
I didn't bother with tge 30 min nonsense,btohqsg
i second this just try aft 5min or smth,btohqsg
Wah shit I tried 5 times applying the PDL and still cannot work,btohqsg
hi my raw score is 15 but after -2 is 13is the raw score of 15 considered first or  13 when moe is allocating a course for me,btohqsg
ooooo are you going to poly or jc?,btohqsg
i got results last yr HAHAHA,btohqsg
Hey guys  just clarifying is the person who submit the quickest going to have a priority over the last person?,btohqsg
Thats not how it works right,btohqsg
No as long as u submit on time  it makes no diff. They consider ur nett score  then citizenship and then raw,btohqsg
I don't think I've experienced such an episode of anxiety and pfessure since O levels,btohqsg
O I thought it was raw first. Is it not? :0,btohqsg
Keep trying until u get it,btohqsg
Poly isn't stressful if your aim is 1.0 CGPA/j,btohqsg

From my experience  yes :') spamming is like daily life for a lot of Os students apparently,btohqsg
"if you wanna do well for like school exams can spam sch exams papers too + prep for some ""tougher"" style qns",btohqsg
spam tys usually ppl do like nearing Os :>,btohqsg

Alternatively  can do the topical tys now  then yearly one nearing Os,btohqsg
