i went for interview with damn and like cb they trashing me cause of my grades,btohqsg
It's all.. no companies hire interns with intention to teach but someone cheap to handle extra work that are too long tedious process 🤣🤣 that's so far the past few companies I work with how the mgmt thinks 🤣,btohqsg
The supervisor also too busy to teach  just throw some work with some basic instructions n hope this intern can do,btohqsg
i also dont know 1 lecturer ask me go try cb after interview i want cry,btohqsg
My ITE 1 really taught me a lot they teach until sometimes they take leave tell other staff i will be in charge anything dont know ask me 😂,btohqsg

So long as it’s not related to your course  it’s technically sai kang,btohqsg
the thing was i had internship 1st then go back for last sem and just nice the things i work on were what i gonna learn when go back to school,btohqsg
so basically my ITE last yr and sem i slack cause i learnt everything from work,btohqsg
But if it's your real job  it involves work like this.. basically jobs at beginner stage involves sai kang 1 lah,btohqsg
Confirmed got teach a bit cause interns need to write report. If all totally don't learn next time the company hard to apply for interns to do sai kang,btohqsg
