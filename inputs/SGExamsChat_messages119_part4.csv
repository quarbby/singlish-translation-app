Covid is coming to get you Johnny,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionwhen you were schooling did you do h2 tys,btohqsg
Or you just practice your fm,btohqsg
I never did any H2 Maths,btohqsg
Can you say the same for your classmates haha,btohqsg
But if your foundations not good you should definitely do TYS,btohqsg
My classmates range greatly in ability,btohqsg
But idk if im good at certain topics cause i havent been tested yer,btohqsg
I have a h2 test on vectors graphs and eqns coming up,btohqsg
It should be easy but maybe ill just brush up on vectors,btohqsg
I took clb last year its easy man,btohqsg
About 3 points too short man,btohqsg
I mean nyjc points plus 3 is my points,btohqsg

If you take higher mother tongue it becomes 2,btohqsg

Is complex no. one of the more easier topics in fm,btohqsg
huh no don't think that lol,btohqsg
like even as a joke is kinda shows that the inferiority complex,btohqsg
Complex is one of the big topics in pure FM  third to conics and linear algebra,btohqsg
Induction  recurrence  polar curves are easier than complex,btohqsg
Learn linear algebra well  helps u alot in uni,btohqsg
Maybe the examples are easier and i havent tried exam qns yet,btohqsg
Linear algebra is the meeting point of pure and applied maths,btohqsg
If it has anything to do with science,btohqsg
Whats the difference between pure and applied math again,btohqsg
Applied maths has less focus on proofs  more on application,btohqsg
Right now i just know that math is split into 'normal' and stats,btohqsg
So if you make a statement you donâ€™t really have to prove it thoroughly,btohqsg
Pure maths is all about proofs,btohqsg
What you do in JC is more applied maths than pure maths,btohqsg
Do the jcs tell you that,btohqsg
Or we have to know ourselves,btohqsg
Or its good to know ourselves,btohqsg
H3 math is a more suitable indicator to see if u are suitable for pure math,btohqsg
The difference between applied and pure?,btohqsg
Best you can do is take H3 to see for yourself what pure maths is,btohqsg
Wait im curious before fm how did people get into unis that require it,btohqsg
Theres no course that require fm,btohqsg
No course in SG requires FM  now and before,btohqsg
Yeah but fid that mean people in sg couldnt get into those courses,btohqsg
Or did they grant an exception,btohqsg
