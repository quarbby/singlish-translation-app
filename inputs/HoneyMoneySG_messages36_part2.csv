As long as the statement incl SALA   salary or anything that indicate it’s salary . I think you can appeal to uob . I think your HR have done sufficient to show it’s a crediting salary,btohqsg

1) The first step is to temporarily block a DBS card via the DBS digibank app. You can do this by tappingMoreon the bottom right hand corner  then scrolling down until you seePayment Controls.Select the card you wish to use  then toggle the card lock option.2) Now go to the merchant and swipe your locked card (or enter your details online  as the case may be). The transaction will fail since your card is locked. That’s exactly what we want to happen.3) Return to the DBS digibank app or login to DBS ibanking and summon the digibot (for the app  tap the question mark on the top right corner and scroll down to tap “ask digibot”  for desktop  click the icon at the bottom right corner).4) Navigate toCheck My Recent Transactions> Dedit Cards>Select the card you used>View Transaction History>Declined Transactions,btohqsg

i guess currently the best card is citi paired w amaze right? but also wondering what yall other pair ur amaze card with other than citi,btohqsg
or is the only best strategy is amaze + citi?,btohqsg
Hello gurus  im planning to switch from cashback to accumulating miles. With an average expenditure of 400-600/mth  I am currently only holding on the HSBC rev + Citi PM for the occasional big expenses >$1k. This combo should suffice right?I may have to spend slightly more just  this month due to a family trip - would y’all recommend signing up CRMC+amaze just for this reason  or can just use Citi PM? After the trip probably won’t have such big monthly expense already.,btohqsg
Basic card to get cause no annual fee,btohqsg
amaze + citi is currently the best all rounder card. If you don't wanna bother with tracking your spending at all  this is a good card combo to get,btohqsg
Signing up for CRMC + Amaze will be beneficial. Not only you earn 4mpd on everything except blacklisted categories and exclusions  you also get 1% cashback from Amaze and a lower FX fee,btohqsg
Oo usually I just use HSBC revo 🙊,btohqsg
Can the 1% Amaze cashback be cashed out (like ShopBack)?HSBC Rev vs CRMC + Amaze differs mainly on us diff exclusions and whether need to pay Fees for FCY right,btohqsg
Where in app I can't find,btohqsg
Does it apply groceries and all dining?,btohqsg
Similar as in fuss free but there coverage is different eg hotel  airlines booking are via hsbc Revolution for the 10x rewards.,btohqsg
Annual fees wise can be easily waived,btohqsg
Both HSBC Revo and Citi Rewards give 4mpd. But Revo gives 2.5% cashback while Rewards gives 2.27%,btohqsg
Cashback is credited as InstaPoints  and you need 2000 points to cashout $20 to your Amaze wallet,btohqsg
3.5% if you have EGA acc? :),btohqsg
look like ega+revo better than citi+amaze,btohqsg
Yes. But do note that EGA also gives 1% on GIRO bill payments  so paying your Citi cards from EGA will also give additional 1% cashback,btohqsg
Both cards give rewards for both categories,btohqsg
we need a 1v1 compare 😭,btohqsg
Just see Chris video is sufficient information is readily available,btohqsg
Any cap on that 1 percent cashback ?,btohqsg
