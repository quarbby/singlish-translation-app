That information wasn't even officially confirmed plus I did told you about my meet happening on the same day as yours & can't be shifted further into the holidays  not sure why you're so shocked.,btohqsg
I want to talk with mr ng2,btohqsg
Because you told me your location for me was at West Coast. Suddenly change near my meet. Idk what you trying to prove. This is car community not car competition,btohqsg
Also I did at kallang  so people can go both meets as its nearby each other knowing theres 2 meets happening at the same time ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Aiyooo then it would confuse people and make things troublesome,btohqsg
If Traffic Police wanna come  easier for them to close off both meets at one place,btohqsg
I shall not mention this any further. You do your meet  I do mine. Whoever want to go wherever  there's no obligations. Cheers,btohqsg
I like this tbh. Might pop by both meets haha,btohqsg
I was referring to that Kayden guy,btohqsg
For you  always have been a pleasure to see you ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
