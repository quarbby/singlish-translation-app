Sorry to hear that you are going through this.DISCLAIMER: This is merely my opinion & suggestions of what I will do if am in your shoes... please don't sue me if it doesn't work out well for you.I presume you commenced work without signing the contract? If that is the case  do you have any other proof of employment?Please don't report to MOM first. MOM should be the last resort.Recruit first is a subsidiary of sgx listed hrnetgroup  quite a big/reputable company  very very unlikely they will play punk on you. Also  hrnetgroup is likely holding onto numerous EA licenses thru its many different subsidiaries  so unlikely that they will be afraid of disruptions in their daily operations if reported to MOM.I suggest you do the following:1. Gather all proof of employment2. Enable phone call recording3. On Tuesday  call/msg the person who you first reported to on that day of work & enquiry status and tell them you have yet to receive salary. If have their email  send email too.4. On Tuesday  send a formal email to the recruit first recruiter to enquire the status & provide your bank account details in the email. Enable send receipt & read receipt for the email. After sending the email  screenshot the email & WA it to the recruiter.Please be formal in all correspondence & do not be rude.Sorry for the less than perfect English  typed everything on my small small phone screen.. Hard to proofreadDISCLAIMER AGAIN: This is merely my opinion & suggestions of what I will do if am in your shoes... please don't sue me if it doesn't work out well for you.,btohqsg
okay thank you for the suggestion :),btohqsg
In the first place whr do you even find that agency,btohqsg
Sg fast job telegram full of people ghosting you,btohqsg
First impression the agency is very sketchy,btohqsg
isn't recruit first pretty well known,btohqsg
Sometimes they might not assess you that well,btohqsg
When i got my previous job,btohqsg
My 'interview' was in a van,btohqsg
A group of people was waiting under boon lay mrt station at a taxi stand,btohqsg
so direct hire and not agency ah?,btohqsg
Idts their van got comp plus van,btohqsg
The van floor full of paper,btohqsg
ok ah then that's different story,btohqsg
They filter and then send to the client,btohqsg
Some clients office quite messed up one,btohqsg
no I meant literally what name of the agency,btohqsg
For me you fill up the application they throw you to random workplace,btohqsg
I mean  u get what u want. They get what they want,btohqsg
So end of the day  they‚Äôre all cool,btohqsg
One of my agent when recruiting us,btohqsg
He smoked 4 sticks in 1 hour,btohqsg
Smoking cigs doesn‚Äôt make u high bruh,btohqsg
Haha ps i meant his behaviour,btohqsg
He shouts like ah beng bruh,btohqsg
I was like fk they selling me?,btohqsg
but jobs through agency the pay usually damn sad one,btohqsg
