@adminhow about those outside Sg who spam members?,btohqsg
Pm me the msg. I will ban them from the group,btohqsg
I thought here also talk about businesses also??,btohqsg
Property also need waterproofing  painting and timber scaffolding maybe I can be the ones helping the members here to solve their issues. I might be needed someday?? Please do reconsider  thank you admin. 🙏🙏,btohqsg
That’s rational reasoning  changed my vote to Save 😅,btohqsg
Many property contractors anyhow set price 1,btohqsg
Example 5 room porcelain flooring tiles cost price only $800 but set at $10000,btohqsg
I don't do tiling works for hdb. Usually for cost price is set according to how many m2 the dimensions of the floor plan. They have other materials to be included and workmanship prices.,btohqsg
They use bangala lo. $20 a Day. Equipment already have,btohqsg
And maybe only earn up to 50cents profits per square feet.,btohqsg
Maybe u wanna try join e bto chat to promote ur services instead?,btohqsg
Or go join e reno chat,btohqsg
I bought the tiles from taobao at $500 n DIY,btohqsg
Actually to be honest India or bangala they do have extra cost like work permit and dormitory. Extra expenses which consumers don't add in.,btohqsg
True also but you see a point that you're doing and hand on yourself??,btohqsg
Wah Lao can save 10k why not,btohqsg
Yes Jim you are saving a cost for that but actually this prices are all mark up by ID firms.,btohqsg
Actually we do differentiate the skills and non skills worker.,btohqsg
I don't want contactors to leech so much from me,btohqsg
My workers after add on per day roughly 80-100dollars.,btohqsg
From light to floor all can DIY,btohqsg
I have 72 workers working for me. Actually doing job like construction line not enough.,btohqsg
If I really donno how  I will look for a bangala do. Skip the middleman contractor,btohqsg
Alot consumers compare price between few contractors actually and goes for the most reasonable one,btohqsg
They either stupid or lazy. Can save so much if diy,btohqsg
Worse case is just find a bangala do directly,btohqsg
U know why tiles usually laid by Chinese workers and not bangla unskilled workers. It’s because tiles laying not simple. For aesthetic  u need to keep the gap small and thin. Definitely not doable for new guysAnd worse is poppingIf you don’t do it properly  after one year or so  the tiles will just pop up suddenly and breakTo repair that one tile  u may have to damage surrounding tiles,btohqsg
Bathroom renovation most expensive coz of waterproofing2nd should be carpentry work because skilled workers more expensive3rd I think is tiles ba,btohqsg
Usually for waterproofing we look at the conditions first.,btohqsg
Actually for me I still think local and Malaysian workers are more skillful on laid tiles.,btohqsg
Some are good some with poor workmanship.,btohqsg
Certainly have revision de  unhappy within 2 weeks normally can rectify,btohqsg
Actually is see their workmanship. Good or bad only.,btohqsg
Cause for bto HDB had materials criteria like last time we use Sands and cement now hdb want all to use premix cement and it is very hard and easily dry therefore alot ID firm prices goes up to $14.50-$15.50/psf due to materials cost went up.,btohqsg
this is costly to homeowners and no guarantee will be good worksmanship like you mentioned,btohqsg
Hdb change the criteria and I know it is costly to homeowners and consumers plus the gst really cost you a bomb,btohqsg
Good workmanship also hard to find,btohqsg
Alot customer choosing vinyl flooring nowadays,btohqsg
Actually this premix cement had changed few years back.,btohqsg
Yeah really depend to homeowners what they want theirs house to be like,btohqsg
Cheaper than lay tiles. If it fit your house design but for long run usually for me personally I will choose homogeneous tiles more easily to maintain and lasting.,btohqsg
Lasting depends on personal maintenance  vinyl looks nice just needed more careful attention to details,btohqsg
Just a advise don't use vinyl at kitchen,btohqsg
For me I am specialise in getting leads for my customers,btohqsg
What kind of produces? Veggies? Fruits?,btohqsg
😂 You want what kind also will receive,btohqsg
Is not produces is products okay!,btohqsg
10 leads enquiry about a min ago,btohqsg
so is which fruit he can produce fastest?,btohqsg
Ah  it's your bad then 😂😂,btohqsg
I accidentally write wrongly only then you all make fun of my mistakes! This is not right.,btohqsg
I read what is written yo. You wrote wrong it's my fault meh? Walau,btohqsg
But let me tell you is not produce is products! Okay!!!,btohqsg
I accidentally write wrongly only then you all make fun of my mistakes! This is not right.,btohqsg
And you call freely call other people idiot and dumb ass?! Omg!,btohqsg
I pointed out one time only. Why you keep spamming??!!  Then this is right ah?,btohqsg
some ppl cannot tahan being poked abt their small mishaps and want to gain ground in argument,btohqsg
Ya lor. I asked according to what he had written. Not to make fun of him. So sensitive 🙄 didn't even thank me! Ah well... Bye guru,btohqsg
My apologies for that  do note that as a business  you'll have to keep an open-mind by being gracious and crack some jokes man..,btohqsg

What stocks are positional and long term investors buying these days?,btohqsg
Anyone wants to discuss the opportunity in starting small business idea please pm,btohqsg
Stocks need so much capital n need wait so long to maybe earn abit,btohqsg
you may like to assume respective index as reference?,btohqsg
But better than bank interest rate,btohqsg
But the time u put to research wad stocks to buy might as well go out n drive grab,btohqsg
N no need to worry if the stocks u bought is ok or not,btohqsg
Maybe it’ll earn more money than the dividends and capital gain,btohqsg
simply put  you want SG equities looked into STI etc.,btohqsg
So look at the Sti components,btohqsg
Waste time researching. Just drive 1 hour $90 then go home sleep better,btohqsg
I guess the idea is about putting money to work for you.,btohqsg
Definitely from the start it gonna be quite insignificant unless you have huge funds to start off with.,btohqsg
Too slow too little returns n need too much capital,btohqsg
uhh  generally safer in due to liquidity and market cap,btohqsg

there's a lot of Crypto cfd brokers  why not research your self?,btohqsg
crypto cfd broker means brokers who work for an actual crypto exchange which allows u to trade on ur own n they just take a lil bit of commission for every transaction u make on their exchange right?,btohqsg
Bro  you sure you wanna trade crypto when you aren't even familiar with exchanges? No offense ah. Perhaps can save you some moolah here...,btohqsg
well i just need to know if the exchange is merely a facility that lets the investor itself do the trading,btohqsg
or is it only that the investor puts money n the trader or bot does the trading?,btohqsg
U are suppose to trade yourself,btohqsg
Like stock exchange  you open account  go in buy and sell stocks. In your current case  crypto instead of stocks,btohqsg
hmmm somehow everyone here who msgs me offer me only packages whereby i put money n allow them to trade for me on my behalf,btohqsg
everyone says they can be trusted n have a team of trusted professionals or bots,btohqsg
where can i find such an exchange?,btohqsg
U give them u prepare get scammed,btohqsg
Correct! Someone paid $500 and the person uncontactable after that,btohqsg
many of those cases here huh?,btohqsg
It's the internet. Scams are everywhere. It's even more rampant when it comes to platforms such as telegram which is keeps the identity of the user secret.,btohqsg
You don't even know who you are talking to and you want to put your $$ with them.,btohqsg
is there a forex/crypto forum or platform online whereby there r many online discussions on this subject? so that we know the different risks we as investors r looking at?,btohqsg
okay  let me provide you the answer..answer is your brain is the best exchange and your eyes the best trader,btohqsg
Dont so bad la kick ppl,btohqsg
haizzzz everyday listen to these templated hardshell messages also damn sick of it... even if not scam also sound like selling fake snake oil with these sentence structure: A+B+CA<oh you can earn ?% of profitz in ?dayz and ?weekz...>B<...start with only $xxx dollarz...>C<... PM meeeee for more detailz! Only seriouz goonduz should contact me>like being spammed,btohqsg
Why all my qns never receive any replies de? No details how to invest sia 🤦‍♀🤦‍♀ they really expect us to 送上门吗？,btohqsg
"hahahahah .... dunno sia... probably their baiting is scripted in ""if-else"" loop sales tactic... like when you dial a call centre or chat bot for service... anything u say out of their scripted logic does not grant you answers.... if the seller cannot answer to your expectation.... move on bah",btohqsg
gf different la ... gf for marrying or otherwise?,btohqsg
But marry already isn't it worse?,btohqsg
IMHO ... see the GF for a potential mate for life is totally different from love... may not even be more or less sextisfaction... maybe from small faults and misgivings that grow into larger deafening silences bah... if GF cannot be life-long mate... then no point to marry (not just for the sake of the HDB flat),btohqsg
Haha. How to boot these bots,btohqsg
How did a convo on chatbot become a discussion on marriage. 🤣,btohqsg
dunno sia.... JJ asked and i answered... sorry if it's out of topic in this group LOL ... i shall stop answering on this topic LOL,btohqsg
Lol dun really care. Better than all the PM me for quick rich schemes here..,btohqsg
i will also 送... hahaha... probably only way to sniff out these scammers LOL,btohqsg

"Hi bro to start off: any ""MLM"" schemes in crypto is a scam..u control ur own trading of ur own cryptocurrency not a platform or pattern trading of some sorts..if approached by such ventures stayaway.tradingof crypto is always done in the different exchanges u put ur coins to not by leveraging or binary platform.dont get burned please",btohqsg
Sucks for the girl though. Haha,btohqsg
He must be damn good looking guy since he has no assets.. Or a super sweet talker 🤔🤔 good riddance for the girl then. What a spineless leech!,btohqsg

Very ugly but he good at talking nonsense,btohqsg
Ah  the sweet talker type. Maybe the girl also 头脑进水 🤷‍♀🤷‍♀,btohqsg
Put yourself in his shoes would you have done same thing? Lol.,btohqsg
Anyway marrying into a rich family can be stressful too especially when u got no leverage.,btohqsg
Too extreme already. He even extort money from his kids saying if they can't get A  need to give him money,btohqsg
Or the give him money bit was lost in context,btohqsg
He's also very stingy. He will walk 5 bus stops to save 50 centd,btohqsg
No lor. If yes  I would have married a rich spouse liao. Right? Lol,btohqsg
There are people who can cope and 死不要脸那种，有没有,btohqsg

U mean home mortgage?Usually I call in and ask for reprice from the same bank. U save legal fees this wayRefinance is when you change bank for lower interestReprice is same bank but change plans for lower interest rateWhen you call for reprice just say you got a much lower quote elsewhereDBS and SCB is offering 1.86%Not sure which banks but the lowest I heard now is 1.80% now,btohqsg
Nah. Not necessarily. If u have the correct information to bargain  going direct to your bank for reprice is the cheapest because you save legal feesMortgage broker can never offer you reprice. They can only offer another bank for refinancing  so the legal fee they can’t reduce for youKey is information. Before you talk to your bank for reprice  if they know you know the lowest price in the market  they will match it or go closer.,btohqsg
