If he ask you out  always expect to pay your share.,btohqsg
if he pays then good for u,btohqsg
if you cant afford  then say go else where,btohqsg
if you always expect to pay your share  then you wont be in this situation,btohqsg
i definitely can afford it and the way he responded to my question was that he expects me to pay for his share,btohqsg
cause if you cant afford it  then don't go lo,btohqsg

i told him we can skip the eating part and just go straight to the shoot itself because I’m on a paid photoshoot so I can’t back out,btohqsg
