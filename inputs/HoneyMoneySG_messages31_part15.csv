Hi everyone. Any tips for contract employee applying miles related credit card? Recently just got reject by hsbc for revolution card and citibank for premier miles card. Given that i am currently earning at least 40k annually based on my month salary.,btohqsg
To keep pace with rising salaries  as part of Budget 2023  the Government will raise the CPF monthly salary ceiling from $6 000 to $8 000 by 2026. The increase will take place in four steps  as shown in this table  to allow employers and employees to adjust to the changes.There will be no change to the CPF annual salary ceiling at this juncture  but it will be reviewed periodically to ensure it continues to cover the broad majority of CPF members.To ensure that employees earning the same annual salary receive the same CPF contributions regardless of their salary structure  the CPF monthly salary ceiling will eventually be set at one-twelfth of the CPF annual salary ceiling at steady state.Source: Ministry of FinanceDiscuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgMore referrals athttps://t.me/sgpromocode#Cpf,btohqsg
Hi   having this issue too. Is the cashback auto deduct like Amex true cashback? Or need to redeem? Because I hit min spend also but no cashback.,btohqsg
It's not a good idea for recurring monthly transactions. End up you have a larger and larger stash of vouchers with no way to offload or spend...,btohqsg
"Just wondering ... my Mum is not on CPF Life and in retirement with age past 70 with zero in RA ... what does it mean if I top up her RA for tax savings? Can I say the payout will be slightly more than RA/(12*(90-age))  with the ""slightly more"" part coming from the RA interest?",btohqsg

Thank you so much I have apply for DBS Vickers account hope this time I could actually buy the ETF,btohqsg
I did this recently. Thereâ€™s a calculator but your mum will need to use her SingPass and it will tell you how much the monthly payout will be and how many months your top-up would last her.https://www.cpf.gov.sg/eSvc/Web/Schemes/LifeEstimator/LifeEstimator,btohqsg
U know the rules right it not allowed ðŸš« here,btohqsg
Nope for days I can't access it. Likely the claim finish before end dates 17 Feb.,btohqsg
Remember to redeem use ezlink app reward points.,btohqsg
Just a note: this may be the last time to get rewards this easily.Good opportunities don't last  that's all I can say.,btohqsg
If I have sufficient miles to straight up redeem biz class to europe for 2 pax.Should I :1)buy economy  use miles upgrade to biz.2) straight up redeem biz3) buy biz  upgrade first.I have assessed that with the miles used  you earned more value in the increment benefit in option 3. But the thought of buying biz seems quite wasteful. Just want to see if my assessment is flawed. Economy ticket (1.8)  biz (5.7)   first (16.6). The amount of miles used to ug to biz and ug to first is quite similar. For the same miles you earn value of (16.6-5.7 = 10.9k) as compared to (5.7-1.8 = 3.9k).So from efficiency and value perspective   I should go for option 3. Appreciate opinion to see if my assessment is flawed. And if any angle I failed to consider.,btohqsg
