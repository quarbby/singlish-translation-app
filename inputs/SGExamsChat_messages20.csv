This is supposed to be an exams chat group,btohqsg
Now it is a ns chat group,btohqsg
3 admins are becoming NSFs this year,btohqsg
This group is whatever I want it to be,btohqsg
Time for everyone around me to leave again,btohqsg
Well deki is our batch so I would assume a lot of people are same batch,btohqsg
She wanted to take FM lol,btohqsg
Many of the people I am aware of here are same batch,btohqsg
We dumb batch so we need to talk to each other,btohqsg
Then like say she kind of regret not taking FM,btohqsg
Now we doing JC talk lmao,btohqsg
You can be like potate the true math fm computing chad,btohqsg
Imagine specialising in a single field,btohqsg
@andrewomeyea I asked him to do that,btohqsg
I literally am the one who convinced him,btohqsg
Coz he put physics instead of FM,btohqsg
Because he was warned that the subject combi was a bit limiting,btohqsg
But end day if he wishes to pursue computing then that physics won't make a damn difference,btohqsg
Like coz they ask him to put what combi he want coz he DSA,btohqsg
Deki didn’t meet requirement but she nvr appeal,btohqsg
That’s how she ended up with chem computing,btohqsg
I think she actually wanted FM computing,btohqsg
Then she took chem bio only so she can only take chem,btohqsg
On hindsight can't rlly tell which would be more killer,btohqsg
If u no interest in math,btohqsg
Well i did chem in jc and some fm in uni,btohqsg
I really cmi the math portions,btohqsg
My chem and FM classmates all were people who just wanted to get rid of their Physics/Bio,btohqsg
They no interest in math one,btohqsg
Then they like legit die in FM,btohqsg
The other 2 just fail all the way,btohqsg
I have classmates who took fm to escape Chem too,btohqsg
4 H2 CFME plus SC VP,btohqsg
Just that arts subject only can choose econs or CLL,btohqsg
Isn’t that what you want anyway,btohqsg
Some schools are like can only choose physics but like they dun care bout the arts subject,btohqsg
The rest of the FM all PFME or PFMCLL,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionbeg to differ coz my class is always top 2 for physics,btohqsg
is anyone else feeling stressed for block exams,btohqsg
We prelim 2nd right but lose to like one class but then they had to calculate the MSG to 2 dp,btohqsg
How they did the MSG was like A is 1 B is 2,btohqsg
I think many beg to differ,btohqsg
Chem is free U to many people,btohqsg
If that’s so why A level tele group got so many chem qn,btohqsg
Some people take the subject just coz more options,btohqsg
That’s why I’m like nobody would say chem>physics coz quite a lot just take for the sake of uni choices,btohqsg
But I have Hep B so I can’t even donate,btohqsg
I’m the most useless blood type O guy,btohqsg
I can’t even save ur life,btohqsg
Plus I got excuse for blood handling vocation,btohqsg
I only saw it when I got into the health website,btohqsg
To see the aero medical appointment,btohqsg
Who wants try tuition during basketball practice? Haha,btohqsg
God told the phone service to screw up,btohqsg
r/nocontext Jung Hon is a vampire!,btohqsg
Blood is an essential part of any fish’s diet,btohqsg
Which is sad because I'm supposed to be A-sian,btohqsg
C and D lorh for chem and fm respectively 72rp,btohqsg
Maybe should’ve taken physics/bio instead of FM,btohqsg
FM big die if u no interest,btohqsg
I rather take computing ig found my interest in it a bit late,btohqsg
Yea ig i took it because I thought it will be like a math,btohqsg
u dont say my rp pulled down quite bad,btohqsg
I think FM better than physics tbh,btohqsg
Prepare you for Calculus for Computing,btohqsg
Yea..didn't rlly like physics in sec sch,btohqsg
Do you guys think China will make the first Coronavirus vaccine,btohqsg
Today Ngee Ann poly release gpa,btohqsg

What if there is no heaven or hell but a void,btohqsg

"also networking is more complicated than just ""it's the same server"" kek",btohqsg

But tbh h3 is more like uni math than FM,btohqsg
It has been 5 days of torture,btohqsg
We’re (the recroots) probably gonna book out late though,btohqsg
Some people used the toilet in the bunk and didn’t clean up,btohqsg
Dun worry we are in the chair force,btohqsg
Even though it’s not just recroots in the bunk,btohqsg
At least u dun have birdshit to clean,btohqsg
:( how is it possible people can trash the toilet that side so badly,btohqsg
Which covers the whole floor and the width is shoulder length,btohqsg
It was ok the last time I went there,btohqsg
The birdshit situation bad until we tape the floor and railings with trash bags,btohqsg
What is the symptom for Covid-19?I've been coughing (not serious) but without fever and coughing syrups seem to be ineffective.,btohqsg
Idh fever. I don't need to worry about Covid-19 right,btohqsg
if things get worse  call a clinic or hospital,btohqsg
Some guy took a shit in the shower and didn’t clean it up,btohqsg
that guy probably never saw a toilet bowl in his whole life/smaybe not  but unlikely,btohqsg

No ifs without fire as the saying goes,btohqsg
BREAKING: Two people in Singapore have died from Covid-19 due to complications  said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.More here:https://str.sg/JfspThe latest on the coronavirus:https://str.sg/Jpa3Stay in the know:https://t.me/TheStraitsTimes,btohqsg
It was inevitable but it is still a shock,btohqsg
the idea of live streaming funeral is sad,btohqsg
Now would be a good time  while I’m still booked out,btohqsg
Pretty sure they will just confine us in,btohqsg

Better than being stuck in Sch 5 I guess,btohqsg

how am I supposed to do my g50 form D:,btohqsg
Is the ns portal always downon the weekends,btohqsg

What a joke (*reads description above*),btohqsg
So even if your score gets lower than expected cos of virus,btohqsg
Means the competition isn’t any weaker or stronger,btohqsg
"""we're taking the ancient  inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom.......... to go to the pub""",btohqsg
also tradingview has a chart for the virus,btohqsg
Yeah man  i die-ded reading this,btohqsg
Got multiple offer only then considered flex. What Earth are you on,btohqsg
genuine question  why hasnt sg done a lockdown yet,btohqsg
The government is probably constantly assessing the situation  as thus far probably believes that the cost of locking down > the benefits of enacting a lockdown,btohqsg
it'll murder the economy more than it'll help the situation,btohqsg
Case in point: China's economy  which has been growing for >30 years (based on GDP)  may finally see a decline this year. Even if it does not  growth will be slowed immensely.,btohqsg
including the whole world tbh 😢,btohqsg
It’s considered a flex on EDMW forum,btohqsg
why not just restrict travel entry for foreigners,btohqsg
then just allow singaporeans to enter,btohqsg
Cause of we do that that our economy will kena,btohqsg
Tourists is a major source of income for sg,btohqsg
for the country to not kena,btohqsg
if kena economy will die anyways,btohqsg
i fully stand for a lockdown tbh,btohqsg
except keep major businesses like banks and what not running,btohqsg
Den all the malaysians who work in sg eat shit ahaha,btohqsg
Singapore has effectively lockdown alr lmao,btohqsg
If the economy dies we will die harder than the virus,btohqsg
Border never close but come in must 14 day SHN  who wanna come,btohqsg
Even wrestling do social distancing. Businesses must be creative also!,btohqsg
Lol all over news dk HAHA,btohqsg

And i wouldnt want a lockdown either,btohqsg

Tik tok and the streaming community is a joke,btohqsg
He jealous Kaplan grad can earn good living mah. Haters always be hating one,btohqsg
Er is not cos of kaplan,btohqsg
I go do any online degree also can,btohqsg
You hater la. Best to fix your mentality first.,btohqsg
Is the job  not the uni,btohqsg
Anyway  best not to engage with you anymore. You too angsty. Once you calm down  we can talk like adults 😉,btohqsg
No link and bs call me angst,btohqsg
Then u must be full of crap,btohqsg
Make sense why I angry at bs,btohqsg
the ultimate goal of a troller,btohqsg
Better than nothing at this rate,btohqsg
Merc have basically the same livery,btohqsg
We have a toothpaste on the grid,btohqsg
Some ppl always angry one. Must have frustration one,btohqsg
So happy sio I wonder why,btohqsg
If y'all need more papers from further back in time  dm me,btohqsg
Looking at overall is a total sham,btohqsg
overall means mye and block exams combined,btohqsg
What happens when healthcare professionals have to make decisions due to burden,btohqsg
First time see u talk here sia,btohqsg

they gave mine out during na,btohqsg
Is okay lemme get my warrant card,btohqsg
but usually ppl who did well for prelims (well enough to get the 25%) are consistent for the other exams too,btohqsg
so jz do well consistently lo,btohqsg
I remembered the glorious days I lost to 3 ppl in the cohort for GP :(,btohqsg
I am not in that convo btw,btohqsg
ofc  im referrin to me sch,btohqsg
iirc its based on ppl arnd ur neighboyrhood also,btohqsg
Why does this remind me of SS,btohqsg

is relative to cohort performance eh,btohqsg
it is a section b srq qn,btohqsg
my neighbourhood is like 80% RJ/HC/AC and AJ,btohqsg
How can they compare people from different schools though,btohqsg
Ull see it soon in ss,btohqsg

ok la lets jz leave it as,btohqsg
Do your best as they say,btohqsg
I think I know what u are trying to say,btohqsg
i always rmb as school cohort lvl performance though,btohqsg
whr got time fuss over all dis,btohqsg
loved how the school lowkey revealed the level positions of ppl selected for uni EAE during prelims,btohqsg
I have more urgent matters to discuss like my social distancing from society when im booked in,btohqsg
when u get conditional admission letter for usp,btohqsg
that one prob guarantees ur money,btohqsg
i still havent open that rubbish since May 2017,btohqsg
water parades are a hazard to society,btohqsg
My right arm is a lot stronger than my left arm,btohqsg
Not because of business outside of ns,btohqsg
That’s what my SMU promotional letters look like,btohqsg
mine was a passport for comp and law,btohqsg
“I met you during our virtual tour...”,btohqsg
then they instantly throw u a letter,btohqsg
tell u u get in alr,btohqsg
i tot usually got like interview one,btohqsg
and it was a double degree application,btohqsg
Its been 2 days since i applied for uni i still havnt gotten acceptance email yet,btohqsg
I can barely make out your name,btohqsg
i hear might take until late April,btohqsg
I actually can’t tell if you’re serious,btohqsg
R E J E C T E D,btohqsg
1 choice and thats nie teaching,btohqsg
NIE doesn’t have a COP right,btohqsg
nie degree is career ending  PGDE is better,btohqsg
the minute u end up in NIE  you just closed off your route to JC,btohqsg
since when pgde got requirements  don't have la lmao,btohqsg
Well that’s cause you’re not a graduate,btohqsg
I was thinking biological scienes then pgde,btohqsg
