And since this is SGExams  I suspect this would be biased towards JC anyway  likely most people here are aiming for JC/alr in JC and beyond.,btohqsg
which ppl froms as thrown into,btohqsg
u look at some of them is like 3.5?,btohqsg
thats still like a b on average,btohqsg
think i die die will go jc anyways lol,btohqsg
"its just me but if i go poly  will feel like im taking the ""easy"" way",btohqsg
I will say the Poly kids in uni always are the better adjusted people.Like the 10-20% low-eq folks tended to be JC. My theory was always that the path to uni through JC threw out people that were pragmatic  hard-working and decidedly unempathetic.,btohqsg
You know there was this stats that showed that 80% of guys from 25-29 were single. Recent stats.,btohqsg
And I just remembered thinking lot of people in uni were just unequipped to date someone  still have so much to grow as people,btohqsg

probly parents bias rub off on me,btohqsg
Once again  my single data point- my JC class of 27 people had only 2 couples. So 4 people dating in total.,btohqsg
Oh not even 4  because they were dating people from other classes,btohqsg
So 2/27  crap sample size but there you go.Now in uni  my major has 38 people and maybe we have 6-8 people dating?,btohqsg
Err I dunno  maybe it's relative because NUS/NTU has less or something,btohqsg
But not that I know  at most it's 10-20% at most.My mom's malaysian  and I always thought it was really interesting that my 8 cousins  6 are dating,btohqsg
Wait wait what are you trying to say bedok?,btohqsg
I hate that all nus sci courses need to go through a cs mod,btohqsg
And then in Singapore  I have no cousins lol because my total 4 aunts and uncles all didn't get married.The difference is ridiculous.,btohqsg
It's Singapore and their technocratic experiment.,btohqsg
And my hope is just 40% to get the â€˜satisfactoryâ€™ grade,btohqsg
Everyone has to learn coding  everyone has to learn X and Y and become the perfect Renaissance Singaporean citizen,btohqsg

You think so? I think our country has a habit of prioritising certain subjectsâ€” pragmatism amiright? Singapore's ultimate virtue.just look at Yale-NUS.,btohqsg
if i dont accidentally show itðŸ’€,btohqsg
How dialects are banned from the radio,btohqsg
coding is just a very important skill as a whole going into how the world works rn,btohqsg
Meanwhile i hv thrown myself into a toxic course,btohqsg
and i mean yes we do prioritise certain subjects but thatâ€™s not really what the cs mod thing is relevant to,btohqsg
