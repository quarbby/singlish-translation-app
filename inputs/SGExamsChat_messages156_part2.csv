Wah I forgot about scale I busy memorising sources of error haha,btohqsg
Basically there is this simple guideline that I go by  if you take quite a bit of time or need to use a calculator to count/measure the value  then it is a bad scale,btohqsg
Like for eg right you want to know the value of the sixth square between 0 and 0.25 but then it's hard to determine instantly so it's a bad scale,btohqsg
Whereas sixth square between 0 and 0.1 is just 0.06,btohqsg
If you get what I mean haha,btohqsg
one sq would be 0.25 lo,btohqsg
unless you mean 1.5 units is in 10 sq then 1 sq is 0.15 which isnt v good,btohqsg
