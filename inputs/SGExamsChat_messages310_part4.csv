Btw does biz analytics need code,btohqsg
Idk I can ask my mum for u,btohqsg
How many hours do u spend on comsci btw,btohqsg
And I dun wanna do that anymore,btohqsg
Ehhh q short to me uh,btohqsg
Is there any hybrid computer science business courses??,btohqsg
Poly really sucks at preparing you for exams,btohqsg
Ok zao back later I think,btohqsg
Are u doing 2109s next sem arh,btohqsg
does everyone need to learn python in nus?,btohqsg
cos of the general education modules,btohqsg
Unless you go rich companies that give good benefits,btohqsg
Hi am curious anyone from business admin in NUS ?,btohqsg
Pm me Pls if you are willing to share your experience,btohqsg
But most ppl may opt to take 1 python/computing related module before graduation,btohqsg
I never took a module taught in Python before ðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
if they dont learn python then what can they learn in computing? just theoretical stuff?,btohqsg
One of the many other programming languages I assume,btohqsg
Did u actively avoid it or just by pure luck? Idw take python either,btohqsg
My curriculum is programming 1 in C  programming 2 in Cpp,btohqsg
And then programming languages don't matter anymore after that,btohqsg
If it requires you to use a certain lang you better pick it up yourself,btohqsg
May i ask anyone who was in pfp about their experience in year 0,btohqsg
same as in year 2004 for me ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
this is very true. I picked up python myself during work.And also use the programming methodology to write bots for maplestory back then ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
my uni everyone learns python and one mod have to use recursion to write function for tower of Hanoi problem or smth,btohqsg
the recursion concept is hard for beginners,btohqsg
its not like some hard ass chess game,btohqsg
but yea its quite simple to understand compared to some of the later concepts,btohqsg
Everyone keeps talking about it like it's calculus in math,btohqsg
i think even 2d array is way harder,btohqsg
did they teach u all that in python?,btohqsg
[[a b] [a b]] is a 2d array,btohqsg
we only learnt the basics algorithms and some ML,btohqsg
Linked list worse. But im an idiot so ig my opinion carries little weight haha,btohqsg
You will probably learn it soon  if not at a higher level,btohqsg
I feel like if you can master this you are quite proficient alr in python,btohqsg
the remaining u have yet to learn is just higher level application,btohqsg
The idiot part of the linked list part,btohqsg
not sure lol i ended up specialising in some sort of business engineering,btohqsg
or esd in my uni if you want to know the proper word for it,btohqsg
so im not going into csd which is essentially cs and software engineering which will prob teach more in depth about programming stuff,btohqsg
think for me the hard concept to pick up,btohqsg
Anyone knows of a Desu in this chat?,btohqsg
Hiii anyone knows the range of cost of a laptop that the poly is selling?,btohqsg
Uncle think Unsupported User is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
My suggestion is get from outside. Sch sell price tends to be not the lowest in markey,btohqsg
U can always compare price in school and online prices,btohqsg
And your qn is kinda vague because different specs of laptop is required for different courses,btohqsg
If u need for intensive programming etc then they usually require more ram and higher processor speed . So set aside 2k?,btohqsg
