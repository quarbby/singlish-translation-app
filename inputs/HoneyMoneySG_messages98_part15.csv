provided the shop allows split payments,btohqsg
Only for uob lady? Cause I checked heymax. It recommended CRMC. So I am a bit confused  as uob lady travel have to be selected category but CRMC doesn't include travel.,btohqsg
True haha I need to ask Jannpaul this weekend,btohqsg
have u checked ur settings on which cards the app show u first?,btohqsg
Heymax indicate 4mpd for CRMC if online right? If buy from physical shop need Amaze to convert to online,btohqsg
5309 duty free is not considered travel for CRMC but it falls under UOB lady‚Äôs definition of travel.,btohqsg
I am afraid you need to amaze it. Heymax unlikely will include amaze in their recommendations if you paywave at the merchant.,btohqsg
My setting is best card to use with cards that I own.,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
Ahhh great luckily I asked. Thanks fam. I think need Amaze just to be safe.,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check if there are other ways to use uob absolute card for public transport since grab pay will discontinue their card,btohqsg
UOB One interest for March is in$420+ for bonus interest posted today 2/4$4+ for base interest posted 31/3,btohqsg
Hi guys  is it possible to use credit card to deposit in webull rather than using debit card ?,btohqsg
Y would u use UOB absolute card for public transport? There are better cards out there giving higher cash rebates for public transport,btohqsg
This is confusing. First you say UOB Absolute card then you say GrabPay card... Both also no link üòÖ,btohqsg
Think he is using grabpay as a proxy for non AMEX accepted merchants,btohqsg
Welp it's confirmed:https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/accounts/everyday-global/everyday+rewards-programme-tcs.pdf- Credit cards have been removed from HSBC Everyday+ Bonus programs. Only debit card spendings earn 1% Everyday+ cashback.- Payments made to financial institutions also excluded,btohqsg
ok to be clear (and cover my S)  Insurance companies are definitely FIs. But whether will be filtered out by HSBC is to be tested.,btohqsg
My $80k with moomoo Fullerton cash fund has stopped crediting daily returns since 29Mar (31jan-29mar). But I have only gotten $541.30  which is about 4% instead of 5.8%. Anyone experience this before and how did you go about getting the rest of the interest?,btohqsg
‚¨áÔ∏è NERF: HSBC Everyday Global Account 1% CashbackSource:https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/accounts/everyday-global/everyday+rewards-programme-tcs.pdfWith effect from 2 May 2024#1: For spend  only HSBC Everyday Global Debit card will earn 1% cashback (Clause 5a)- HSBC Credit Cards excluded from 1% Cashback#2: For GIRO  the following merchants are excluded from 1% cashback- Payments made to financial institutions  securities brokerages or dealers (including but not limited to the trading of securities  investments or crypto-currencies of any kind) (Clause 5b)üëâ Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgüó£Ô∏èüëâ More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocodeüì¢,btohqsg
Have u checked ur coupon? Moomoo will top up the rest of the interest with coupon.,btohqsg
Can I check  ocbc hardly waive credit card late charges ?,btohqsg
Your 60 days ended 28 Mar?,btohqsg
gonna terminate my Advance card and switching to DCS Ultimate,btohqsg
Just a side note  DCS cards cant be added to any mobile wallet (i.e. gpay  applepay  samsungpay),btohqsg
Insurance companies are considered financial institutions? Means if ega will not get 1% cashback for paying insurance via giro?,btohqsg
GIRO for CC payments no more cashback? ‚òπÔ∏è,btohqsg
So use hsbc acct to giro pay dbs credit card wont get 1%cashback ü•≤,btohqsg
Hahahaha if bank not financial institutions then what are they doing?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs a major nerf for meüåöI don‚Äôt even know how to pay cc bill now,btohqsg
So now there's really not much reason to use the revolution card anymore,btohqsg
Consolidate all on DBS CC and then pay one shot without rewards ü§£,btohqsg
You must understand  I just setup GIRO to start this month payment,btohqsg
maybe just exclude those trading platform?,btohqsg
I think so too. Since bank cc is like ega biggest usage,btohqsg
If exclude cc bill payment they could have stated as such instead of using terms like financial institutions,btohqsg
isn't it broader to cover FI.. that's EVERYTHING..,btohqsg
which is exactly how they are bleeding $500 per customer,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtI think insurance still üëåüèª. Their debit card 1% cashback split insurance from financial institutions very clearly.,btohqsg
i hope so too... i guess anyone proven wrong is a 'happy problem'..but definition of FI.. honestly.. covers banks and insurance companies  and some say finance companies.,btohqsg
anyway  need to test to know for sure,btohqsg
yeah i guess no harm since most of us will be lazy to change our current GIRO arrangement and no other alternative anyway,btohqsg
Hello anyone can advise like anyways to pay ccard without,btohqsg
Pull out the publicly available t&c for the promo till Jul 24.,btohqsg
By paying in full before the due date.,btohqsg
Cuz I have like 8 k to pay but u see I pay 1 k evey month also still got interest incurred,btohqsg
Don't have the 8 k one shot,btohqsg
Then you need to review your spending. And try to return 2k instead of 1k. Clearly you're not a CC person.,btohqsg
So like any ways like can brake the loan amount in to 8.months or 6 months,btohqsg
See if other bank got balance transfer promo,btohqsg
