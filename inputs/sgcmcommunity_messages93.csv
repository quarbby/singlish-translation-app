1.5T known to have blinker fluid leak,btohqsg
That’s why not many around on the road,btohqsg
That’s why headlight can like get water damaged or like,btohqsg
the fogging also expensive to clear,btohqsg
newer models better can reserve charge the headlights if die,btohqsg
No but then the newer infotainment takes away from the reserve battery,btohqsg
I think you should just buy extra batteries,btohqsg
3 to 4 weeks at least,btohqsg
Okay i got a lot of stuff to learn haha shit man,btohqsg
That's why best to buy car only when you turn 40,btohqsg
Then buy car know everything already,btohqsg

Did you all see the wrecked e-tron the other day at the carpark of chemical guys? - J,btohqsg
i very sad for this 335i,btohqsg
i assume the car only needs a polish then its ready to be road worthy again,btohqsg
Chemical guys will do its magic,btohqsg
Looked like a total loss to me - J,btohqsg
The airbag deployed all - J,btohqsg
Just some fender bumper clips will do its job,btohqsg
most sg insurance company view airblag deploy as total loss,btohqsg
which is damn stupid because some cars deploy airbag easily,btohqsg
what if the airbag anyhow deploy without impact like that time got one takata recall,btohqsg
but u have to understand modern car airbag and the cars of 10-20 years ago is different,btohqsg
And airbags aren't so hard to replace,btohqsg
And most new cars have sub frames that can be changed,btohqsg
Replacement of the entire dashboard is pretty much needed in many cars now because unlike the past (where there’s a rectangular cutout for airbag deployment)  our cars now have the airbags flushed beneath. This means when it deploys  it rips through. That is why I DO NOT recommend anyone to put stuffs on their dashboard  especially the passenger side.,btohqsg
Nowadays airbag is sealed into the dashboard  old cars have the small rectangular cutout,btohqsg
its not cheap to replace the whole dash,btohqsg
Unless you crash cause of the airbag deployed,btohqsg
imagine those hiace put the katana on dashboard,btohqsg
i see people put on dash also,btohqsg
if u hit the right spot  volvo airbag deploy for SAFETY purposes,btohqsg
u can see the photo on the top right  looks like almost 0 damage,btohqsg
to fix the entire car up  it wld cause upwards of 40k,btohqsg
THEN MY HELLO KITTY SOFT TOYS HOW KOR KOR,btohqsg
This is if passenger airbag deploys,btohqsg
You just be ready for plastic surgery,btohqsg
Cause the cars won't fly straight,btohqsg
wa kinda annoying sia these scammers,btohqsg
I try my best to get rid of them! - J,btohqsg
is this Mr J the same guy who reviews cars on youtube,btohqsg

hahahaha poor thing sia@MSBSH00. He was doing his civic duty but kena report - J,btohqsg
the jaguar engineers literally took an IPAD and stick it on the dash,btohqsg
and the buttons on the centre console look so dated,btohqsg
not to mention the space utilisation of the volvo is much better than the jag,btohqsg
It takes one swipe to turn off the start stop function on the XC60 😹😹,btohqsg
OHHHH so it’s about flashy cars now ah,btohqsg
wait i don’t mean to offend u,btohqsg
but isn’t the xc60 dash a vertical tablet w vents on the side?,btohqsg

Does your wife and daughter like the car though?,btohqsg

Oh god. STOCK LIFE BEST LIFE SIR. Some wise persons told me that before,btohqsg
Where is the fun in that unless u change car freq,btohqsg
Must swap seats  steering wheel  ohlins time  exhaust rims,btohqsg
and finally  put an M4 bodykit on the car,btohqsg
Or you buy a car that you’re so happy with  there’s no need to modify to become something it’s not?,btohqsg
Life is about seeking improvements. 😂😂😂,btohqsg

hi can i make an enquiry regarding car matters here?,btohqsg
is a car/van rental company allowed to claim from you money first on the sole reason of “Just in case” LTA want to claim?,btohqsg
is this a legitimate practice out there?,btohqsg
not too sure  maybe someone else can help,btohqsg
any help would be greatly appreciated,btohqsg
So you're renting a car/van and the company says they're making you pay a deposit in case of damage and fines?,btohqsg
It’s going to be an essay,btohqsg
the story goes like this  van driver hit divider and no one else involved. police report made and i myself had to find out if LTA themselves made any claims because the company dont want to produce notice number when prompted multiple times. After back and forth calls with LTA officials i received and email stated at the day  date  time  and location of the offence as in the police report made NO repairs was made to the divider. I show email to the rental company and now the funny thing is they want me to get an email from LTA saying that there will indefinitely be no claims made against them for that offence,btohqsg
lmao  they alr got ur driver records and IC. when LTA ask for payment then u pay lo,btohqsg
i dun see why need to hold ur money indefinitely,btohqsg
There’s no black and white for this,btohqsg
Yeah they can't withhold your deposit in this case because if LTA claims it'll go through the insurance,btohqsg
/thecompany and then they can find you,btohqsg
is there anywhere on official govt websites indicating so?,btohqsg
no notice number pay what sial,btohqsg
They cannot hold your deposit indefinitely under the pretense of expected claims from LTA,btohqsg
u tell them show fine/letter then u pay. who the hell pays a fine without notice number,btohqsg
no but got black and white they took the money and hold it,btohqsg
No because the only way they can hold money like this is if it was mentioned in their contract terms,btohqsg
And most rental co.s don't have any such term,btohqsg
charge them interest if no fine :),btohqsg
yes the deposit but not in the cotract,btohqsg
You langgar already so deposit can say good bye,btohqsg
And it's not in your contract,btohqsg
But if you keep fighting them also no resolution one  so best if you follow up with LTA and get the email,btohqsg
LTA not scammer  they will not claim against in the future,btohqsg
But you hit alr so usually accident is forfeit deposit to pay insurance excess,btohqsg
yup at most all i hear within a month or two LTA will send letter for the fine or claims,btohqsg
this happened in march this year,btohqsg
company got the cheek saying pending,btohqsg
after i show them email then they reply promptly to my queries,btohqsg
Just say good bye to your deposit lah,btohqsg
Still have money leftover after subtracting insurance excess?,btohqsg
tbf govt agencies does take quite some time. but i dont think it takes > 6 months,btohqsg
plus $4k after accident for the alleged LTA claims but no have 🤷🏽,btohqsg
the amount shocking right for divider  even the LTA rep also say if langgar divider not expensive like that,btohqsg
to the company under the pretence that LTA may or may not want to claim,btohqsg
u need find lawyer alr bro,btohqsg
If u paid and lta didn’t bill them u can just report to the police for fraud then if they don’t give h back,btohqsg
Your deposit got so large meh,btohqsg
i giving them 1 more chance,btohqsg
If they don’t give it back u should just report to the police for fraud,btohqsg
I don't get why you paid anything over your deposit,btohqsg
Because really any LTA claim also,btohqsg
As part of third party claims,btohqsg
Your plan a bit delayed ah bro,btohqsg
Then you happy happy go pay them 5.5k,btohqsg
yah sia  was it reflected in ur payslip?,btohqsg
ahhh i can choose to not work 😅,btohqsg
1 to 2k for car/van for short to mid term rental is normal,btohqsg
I see for short term rental for cars  even p plate under 23 driver deposit under 1k,btohqsg
hmmm thank u guys anything i enquire again lah,btohqsg
Hope you get your money back,btohqsg
now want go company and negotiate otherwise i go make police report for fraud,btohqsg
Cannot let them take advantage like this,btohqsg
its been 8 months. LTA has yet to send the letter. I think can refund me alr.,btohqsg
which rental company is dis sia  need boycott alr,btohqsg
Or maybe go down to LTA then ask them for official black and white that they’re not claiming,btohqsg
this not the first case they “claim” ppl. i assume their tactic is take the money first and in hopes the driver also blur sotong and forget abt it and the money they makan,btohqsg
google can find them quite fast,btohqsg
will update lah if they say anything else funny,btohqsg
Wah you never take off the plastic on your screen,btohqsg

Woooo time to do some research on Mitsuoka,btohqsg
Their cars all look so unique,btohqsg
Blue  black  this colour. All gorgeous,btohqsg
Put a unique styling on an otherwise common production platform,btohqsg
Yeah i love their style. but the price also nice HAHAHA,btohqsg
Slight price to pay for uniqueness things?,btohqsg
I like to see these kind but I dont dare to drive HAHAHA - E,btohqsg
I rather drive a car I am more confident in controlling. Safer for me and people on the road. - E,btohqsg

It’s almost sounding like only bmw drivers hit school children routinely.,btohqsg
unfair to the brand but anyway  its a matter of statistics i think. more bmw owners = more reckless drivers.u never ever see a reckless mitsuoka driver cos there isn't much owners anyway,btohqsg
Don’t get me wrong. I get damn stirred when I see inconsiderate drivers especially in silver or school zones,btohqsg

Keeping the COE price under control: Should Singapore adopt a 'one car  one household' policy or a separate COE category for commercial vehicles? 🤔COE prices have reached all new heights in the recent times  and it could be high time for the system to be revised. Will these suggestions work?👉🏻 Comment and share your (friendly) opinions on this!➡️ Read ithere!,btohqsg
“Comment and share your (friendly) opinions on this!”,btohqsg
Seperate PHV COE sounds better than one car one household thingy,btohqsg
Haha  this will negatively impact our dearest big decision makers  you think they will enforce this?,btohqsg
there arguement on keeping price under control is invalid to the government.,btohqsg
Trying to promote a car lite society  lower the price to make it more affordable? no way haha,btohqsg
The rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer,btohqsg
Should lower COE for BMW owners. So that they don't feel so angsty,btohqsg
This is not about getting richer or getting poorer. It doesnt impact your disposable income whether coe price go up or down. It only affect whether u get to own it or not. It is the government goal to reduce cars on the road  why would they to lower the price for those that can barely afford a car.,btohqsg
At the end of the day  it is rather self stabilizing unless the the government shrink the overall quota.,btohqsg
actually if they shrink the overall quota.. it is also self stabilizing,btohqsg
Yes but it is more likely for prices to go up,btohqsg
10 year total Demand remains the same but supply shrinks  overall price will go up on a 10 year average,btohqsg
no car then how to have car mart,btohqsg
like that we will have to talk about bus mods liao,btohqsg
The toxic black sheep who blatantly disregard laws,btohqsg
singapore should never enforce a one car one household policy,btohqsg
It will never happen.Ownself shoot own foot?😂This must go through parliament  their family also needs their cars.😂,btohqsg
I concur. Unlikely. The most is intro progressive coe cost.,btohqsg
i got one will be unhappy,btohqsg
cos more households regardless of where they live utilise more then 1 car,btohqsg
Just like property  2nd car should pay progressive coe and also higher tax.,btohqsg
Many many COEs lying around big rental company 😂 ahem ahemAlso car dealer carpark😂,btohqsg
Parking cost for 2nd car or 3rd car in hdb parking already progressive and that doesn’t reduce car growth but become more of a showcase of rich  might as well have them pay more to bring down public transport cost.,btohqsg
It was discussed on parliament  a few years back.absd on COEs.Get thrown out.Ship has sale😂,btohqsg
I feel this is the most reasonable,btohqsg
Well we all know the vested interests for those households having the need for one car for father  one for mother  one for adult children  one for grandparents. 😂,btohqsg
Maybe also to prevent schools to overload with parents fetching their children.,btohqsg

You put in separate phv COE the total COE quota for cars will still stay the same,btohqsg
Cars were never meant to be affordable or accessible in Singapore like other countries because cars are really not a necessity,btohqsg
To many of us they might be since we travel a lot or are just used to them,btohqsg
But as a general member of the public  you can get by with public transport just fine,btohqsg
Just that it takes more effort and time,btohqsg
One car pee household doesn't solve anything  what if the household has 3 working adults that all have different schedules and different locations to travel to in a day?,btohqsg
Can buy then buy  cannot buy must work harder! Use it as motivation!,btohqsg
But don't fall into debt trap,btohqsg
Sorry for the harsh statement here but the truth is bitter,btohqsg
2023-2024 is when most of LCR Uber cars will be scrapped,btohqsg
But they are using a ladder approach to scrapping cars by scrapping some early so that they don't crash the COE prices down too much,btohqsg
Because having a higher COE only benefits them by keeping market for car sharing and PHV alive,btohqsg
Especially with grabs being as expensive as they are already  a heavy crash in COE price can result in them losing a sizeable chunk of their market of customers who might be spending the same amount of money on grabs in a month that they can spend on paying monthlies for a decent car nowadays,btohqsg
Will crash.November Feb gonna raise interest rate 0.75 - 1.00%,btohqsg
I still want to get a new sss,btohqsg
https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSRpCSwrX/must take notes of unEmployment rates,btohqsg
It won't be a crash  rather a correction in the market. I doubt a very significant correction will take place,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone interested in doing a 2-3 minutes survey on EV/Plug in hybrids? Can win $50 worth of grab vouchers 😅😂,btohqsg
Sounds too good to be true,btohqsg
im a uni student just doing a project bro,btohqsg
4500 members * $50  can buy a car liao,btohqsg
I'm just doing my job as a hardworking citizen to weed out the scammers,btohqsg
uh.. only a few will win the voucher,btohqsg
Anyone wanna do a survey on how sexy J is? winner will get a kiss from the man himself,btohqsg
if anyone else wants just drop me a dm! im a cs student in nus,btohqsg
Interesting   i never thought of that. I have always been strong believer that phv and commercial have their own category. I never thought it made sense if they are making money through their vehicles so bidding high just means slightly less profits for them whereas people who genuinely needs a car cant afford cos its so damn high.But since quota is the same  it may not make such a difference  except create more demand in cat b and price will eventually go up anyway,btohqsg
filling up a survey on EVs and plug in hybrids,btohqsg
Yes i concur with this  but still there is a way around this  because the car can be under the spouse  children  parents  grandparents name,btohqsg
Don't need the voucher also :),btohqsg
Yuppp  because everyone seems to misunderstand the concept of COE. It's always been to regulate the number of cars on the roads,btohqsg
Actually the govt should open up the forum more often  get more ideas from the public. Im sure there will be a handful that are worth considering,btohqsg
Recently the raised the tax for luxury cars  but people can still afford them  but they dont realise those owners dont contribute to the congestion or car population directly. Most of the ultra luxury cars are not driven daily and parked in landed property. Even if driven daily  they cant drive all 10 cars on the road at the same time,btohqsg
"Most people don't know this but they can email the minister of transport office directly and pass on their suggestions and they usually get a reply back promptly. Playing devil's advocate here but I foresee opening up a forum doing no good as many might have their own agenda to push and might not understand the fundamental idea and push for irrational rules such as the ""one car per household"" etc.",btohqsg
You're right on this  this is why a shift to a more usage based system can help  similar to the classic car coupons. The new road tax system is a good step in this direction,btohqsg
Yes the forum will attract a lot of anwers that has their own agenda and doesnt solve the problem  or worse creates a bigger problem. But im sire there is at least 1 answer that is worth considering,btohqsg
Brother I know you scammer  come after conversation can ah?,btohqsg
I tend to not trust emailing in  tried that before for other agenda and it didnt work haha,btohqsg
Yes it will definitely change things. In fact i feel road tax should be based on a computation of the usage and tonnage of a vehicle.,btohqsg
Hopefully the new ERP system will be a good move at equipping all vehicles for this,btohqsg
Barring the ugly ERP unit we have to put up with,btohqsg
Like seriously if you want to change it  just give us the same one you have designed for motorbikes  it's perfect,btohqsg
No one wants a CDC taxi screen and forced nav in their car,btohqsg
Better yet  just use the rfid like malaysia,btohqsg
Commercial could be charged a flat fee to avoid price fluctuations,btohqsg
This is where separate road tax for phv and taxis can come into play,btohqsg
And could also deter incessant fleet upsizing or upgrading,btohqsg
Just converting to private hire shouldn't be the classification here,btohqsg
They must be associated with some sort of service provider to avail this benefit,btohqsg
Since the commercial cars will be used to travel maybe 50k a year  they could be charged based on that,btohqsg
So if a private car owner is willing to pay that price for a flat fee so be it,btohqsg
I think there could be ways around it  such as registering a company and use the car for private hire,btohqsg
I would rather have a percentage based subsidy for the commerical cars based on association with service provider,btohqsg
Flat fee might be something that's a bit of a benefit for those who would run their car way more than the flat fee mileage,btohqsg
Even if the tax cost are passed down to the consumer  and it become as expensive as japan  maybe more people will consider taking public transport instead,btohqsg
They aren't driving so why pay road tax?,btohqsg
actually road tax is not correct,btohqsg
They're paying a higher ARF  insurance and COE anyway,btohqsg
roadtax is a to cover emissions,btohqsg
The price of those cars could pay off years of road tax in the current system,btohqsg
If u can afford to buy those cars and not drive them  by all means. Nobody is stopping you,btohqsg
bro road tax max nowadays 4k for ferraris  is the ARF that is painful,btohqsg
Doesn't have to be sports car,btohqsg
You park on private property  u dont drive out  win win for the public,btohqsg
So why ev pay more? Lol,btohqsg
i have an answer from the government,btohqsg
So because sports cars are driven less,btohqsg
Doesn't mean they'll all buy sports cars and drive less,btohqsg
Its ok if you dont understand  but if you are driving a point  just say it,btohqsg
In the end based on your logic  everyone drives lesser,btohqsg
the 3.5k road tax is peanut to them,btohqsg
The cars cost a 100 times of that. So what if their road tax drops to 1k instead of current 10k,btohqsg
This is the key point still for Mr Tio who doesn't seem to like performance oriented cars,btohqsg
Yupp  ARF still stays on as the kicker,btohqsg
Driving less=Less road tax for all cars,btohqsg
Why are you making this about people owning sports cars,btohqsg
If you have an agenda against them,btohqsg
Pete recently also did PHV with a car with an 80L tank,btohqsg
Lol how did i miss that?,btohqsg
And wanted to buy a Malaysian reg car to be able to buy msia 95 and then pump that into his Singapore 80L car in Malaysia,btohqsg
Gets my juices going at this hour,btohqsg
big to you  not big to them leh,btohqsg
