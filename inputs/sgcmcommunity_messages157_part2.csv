2016 17 18 Mazda 3 90% all PHV w tuned mileage flooding the market,btohqsg
Buy deluxe or hb.. phv don’t use those.. they use standard,btohqsg
Some dealer advertisd their Mazda 3 as non phv with low mileage. Don't know is real or not,btohqsg
actually LTA should allow us to check whether the car was used as PHV prior anot,btohqsg
dk why they didnt do this..,btohqsg
Ya lor  right now there is no way to check right? Milleage always get tampered so can't check from there. At most is service record? But can be tampered also,btohqsg
Buy new car lor  that what LTA wants,btohqsg
Don't bother with the COE clas not worth it,btohqsg
Their build quality wasn't the best,btohqsg
