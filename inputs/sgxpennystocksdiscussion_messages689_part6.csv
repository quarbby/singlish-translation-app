"DBS  other ASEAN banks ride U.S. rate hikes to stronger earnings1. Banks in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are expecting higher returns from their lending businesses in the current rising interest rate environment  as soaring inflation prompts tightening from the U.S. Federal Reserve.2. ""If you have higher inflation  I think the central banks will have to push through with more aggressive interest rate hikes "" said Piyush Gupta  DBS' chief executive officer  in an earnings briefing on Thursday. ""The interest rate flow-through has been quicker and sharper than we anticipated "" he said. ""The Fed policy actions have been quicker. These two massive 75 basis-point hikes were unexpected.""3. The bank generated net interest income of SG$1.7 billion  a rise of 16% from the previous year. ""In the shorter run  banking would benefit very much "" Helen Wong  OCBC's CEO said on Wednesday during the company's earnings briefing. ""Over the last low interest rate cycle  we continued to grow our book  so the loan book has grown and also deposits "" Wong said. ""So I think that laid a foundation to capture the rise in interest rates.""4. Net interest income for the bank climbed 18% from the same period a year ago to SG$1.86 billion during the quarter. ""Overall we expect mid-single digit loan growth "" UOB's CEO Wee Ee Cheong said during an earnings conference last week. ""In the next 12 to 18 months  we will benefit from rising rates through higher net interest income "" he said. ""We do not expect a recession in our key markets.""5. Fitch Ratings said in a report last month that Singaporean banks are poised to benefit from the rise in global interest rates  while asset quality risks remain contained  as an economic recovery continues across the core markets of the city-state's lenders. ""We believe Singapore is one of the Asia-Pacific markets with the largest pass-through of higher U.S. interest rates into local lending yields "" Fitch said. ""This should boost banks' operating profit.""More here",btohqsg
