It’s official: The new Aston Martin Vantage is hereFollowing a sneak preview several months ago  Aston Martin Singapore has just launched the new Vantage here officially.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Looking good ✨,btohqsg
Yeah  their promo price is 186k for Luxury. 196k for luxury sports.,btohqsg
Kona hybrid top spec is 178k.,btohqsg
If money not the issue and both got specs you like then just get the one you feel looks better,btohqsg
i like also but kona still considered low end model in the fleet,btohqsg
whereas CX5 is not low end in mazda,btohqsg
Means clearing stock for new CX5,btohqsg
Yeah  CX-5 checks most of the boxes at this price. My only qualm is the interior is quite dated and its warranty and servicing package is not as comprehensive as Komoco’s.,btohqsg
Also  seems like a hybrid version is coming to replace the mild hybrid.,btohqsg
The next question is can you wait then,btohqsg
I feel like komoco servicing is crap😂,btohqsg
Cos the car is very old,btohqsg
anyone buy 2020 nissan serena? any long term issues,btohqsg
2025 alot of new refreshes so many clearing stock,btohqsg
Now abit weird esp since higher chance of coe dropping  might be paying the same amt for refreshed model in a few months vs the clear stock today,btohqsg
Imagine u buy pre face lift 150k. Face lift 150k,btohqsg
The CX-5 M Hybrid was just introduced in Jan this year  wasn’t it? I suspect the full hybrid would come in early 2026.,btohqsg
Either go full Hybrid or full ICE,btohqsg
I nvr believed in Mild Hybrids,btohqsg
