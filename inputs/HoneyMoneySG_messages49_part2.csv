Thatâ€™ll affect the market heavily right?,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtnow is UOB lady card expert  her number 1 card now. Can ask her anyt about the card. I'll be travelling next week trying amaze with the lady card too.,btohqsg
yes less reliance on USD cause it de dollarisation and people won't use USD and then less sanctions from them also,btohqsg
But what does this mean for Singapore?,btohqsg
won't affect much for Singapore  but imo  USD will drops once BRICKS currency is up and running,btohqsg
BRICKS will take few years.Still USD for now.,btohqsg
no matter whats the answer you get from wherever  be sure to DYODD ok. cos no one can be responsible for your money other than yourself,btohqsg
Maybe. Election coming so the currency is dropping,btohqsg
i won't give any advice for this but pls DYODD :),btohqsg
anyway  whatever is said today is no hard feelings and just own opinionsjust that as there is always someone more savvy than you  there will also always be someone less financial literate than you and they come here to learn of hacks to maximise their money.so its good to be clear on the specifics of what you are advocating for since honestly there is no consequence to you even if things go south,btohqsg
usd even 6 mths treasury is 5.43%(risk free rate). So those fixD  that is priced lower is undercutting customers. Also notice alot of USD new bond issue recently at sky high rates and nobody touching. I think likely due to massive amt of printing and yet value still similar to pre printing making everyone worried.,btohqsg
After much participation in online channels I have learned never to make any investment recommendations.People blame u if u wrong.People forget u if u right.Most importantly it is illegal to make recommendations without mas licence.,btohqsg

hi new here. just want to ask  is there any insurance premium hacks that survived?,btohqsg
Mayhe this is a valid reasons,btohqsg
Recall our honey monely also got rejected before too so u are not alone,btohqsg
I have OCBC premier and I am still rejected from their credit cards.,btohqsg
You hold too many credit cards? Or terminate many credit cards before?,btohqsg
Self employed is different from MNC. It affects your credit card application.,btohqsg
How long did it take anyone who is new to HSBC to get credit card application approved?,btohqsg
Wonder if it makes a difference to call HSBC - wonâ€™t expedite the application right?,btohqsg
What card do you use? On trust card itâ€™s considered food and dining  not groceries,btohqsg
Then what about at NTUC still under the same MCC? Still dinning?,btohqsg
I wanted to use UOB lady as my selected category is dinning but as I not sure what mcc the fairprice app is under,btohqsg
Fairprice is considered groceries for trust card,btohqsg
I will try with other banks,btohqsg
But I app always paying through the QR code in the fairprice app. For groceries shopping and at Kopitiam. So my question is the mcc different if you're making payment to kopitiam and making payment for ntuc groceries shopping.,btohqsg
As far as I aware based on OCBC & DBS  salary credit via GIRO only be counted as salary credit.,btohqsg
how do you all buy US T-bills? through tiger dont have this option,btohqsg
Is there a reason why people would rather use UOB EVOL card as compared to the ONE card? Iâ€™ve seen a few messages here asking about EVOL but if you spend monthly and hit certain amount  iâ€™m under the impression that ONE card might be a better option? ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Sometimes u call  they will tell u got docs or something pending from your end. Or maybe the application kena missed out. No harm calling,btohqsg
depends on ur spending category. Evol cashback is 8% if most of ur spending are online and contactless. Uob one is 3.33% or less.,btohqsg
1). How about I only can spend $6xx on particular month but not the 3 months in one cycle ?2). If you spend $550  $450 $525 on UOB one card on that 3 months cycle  how much cash back you can earned?,btohqsg
can. i fast transfer to myself to uob and purpose i put salary. reference put PAYNOW SALA,btohqsg
What can the $500 spend be? Bus trips?,btohqsg
im using evol card and bus trips are part of my $500 spending. but for evol itself need to hit $600 for the cashback so thats the target,btohqsg
So any uob card considered as spend for uob one?,btohqsg
not all  the ppv not included. offhand i dont have the list but its definitely not all,btohqsg
Uob one   uob evol and uob ladyâ€™s i believe,btohqsg
So can only use the uob one card for the $500 spend requirement?,btohqsg
No. I listed 3 credit cards above.1. UOB one card2. UOB Evol3. UOB ladyâ€™sAll 3 credit cards that I listed are eligible to get the bonus interest in uob one account if u meet the min spend requirements,btohqsg
i see. i guess if u hit to 1000 2000 category in UOB One then it make sense to use that card for higher cashback?,btohqsg
Oh ok. What items consider eligible spend?,btohqsg
Can anyone advise if I use UOB bank as a CPF investment bank to buy TBills and after auction result when will be the deduction? So far did not see any deduction from my CPF OA. Thanks,btohqsg
hmmm i just read one card benefits again. even if iâ€™m spending $2k monthly it still make sense to use EVOL for cashback?,btohqsg
