Hi anyone knows HSBC EGA bonus interest has been going on for how long till date? I am wondering if it is worth the effort to go apply for 2 accounts to try to get the bonus interest. Month by month extension of the bonus interest programme don't give me much confidence that they will continue leh.,btohqsg
Lots of fluctuations in interest rates  can only see around one quarter in advance unfortunately.,btohqsg
I have been on it for 2 years already,btohqsg
Even with fluctuation  they usually offer amongst the highest rates compared to their rivals. Just more hassle.,btohqsg
They have the bonus interest promo continuously for the past 2 years?,btohqsg
Yes  maybe even longer. Just that they adjust their rates every month.,btohqsg
Thanks eh. I will apply asap. Haha.,btohqsg
You'll have to keep a record of when your cycles start though and the rate. Interest only comes in about 5 months later.,btohqsg

the latter option... but if you really unsure you can call them to check,btohqsg
there are alot of ways via online (Phishing  scam  etc..) or offline (rob  lost of wallet)How to prevent?1. Ensure you dont lose your card....2. Dont be gullible  doubt everything when you doing something online (Such as is this website legit),btohqsg

For EVOL  understand SP utilities is not considered for any CB.from UOB EVOL card website  there's a conversion to green credits for SP bills.does anyone know is this conversion monthly or it's just 1 time?,btohqsg
Actually im curious what's the use of green credit? Offset bill? Haha,btohqsg
both uob and SP sites quoted Green Credits can use to offset SP utilities bill. abit too good to be true if it offsets monthly. that's why im asking.,btohqsg
If you don't have any other credit cards (no credit history) then it's better not to apply together. the 1st card won't matter  but 2nd card you apply might reject on the basis of lack of credit history. multiple rejections will hurt your credit score. (this is sadly from my own experience)if you already got a credit history and eligible for the cards  then the impact is negligible.,btohqsg
green credits is just to fund uob to plant trees  u dun get anything other than good karma,btohqsg
Bill payment to town council consider as eligible spend for ocbc 365 and Uob One,btohqsg
