Then like that how is the igp gonna determine,btohqsg
igp only shows the grades entered for “humanities and sciences” for example,btohqsg
??? It started the year after me tho,btohqsg
oh misremembered but yea too late for me,btohqsg
but yea you see there’s “humanities and sciences” which is multiple diff courses while the specific ones like data science and econs are the direct entry ones,btohqsg
So there are 2 igp  like those who are direct entry and those common entry?,btohqsg
each direct entry has their own igp bc if you’re successful you’re just in that major,btohqsg
common entry is like a basket of diff majors that you decide later on,btohqsg
so you don’t get admission into the specific major yet,btohqsg
i think philosophy  politics  and economics is a different basket,btohqsg
while common entry dont need interview ?,btohqsg
ok yea humanities and sciences is the only common entry basket,btohqsg
knn cygnus shirt out of stock,btohqsg
