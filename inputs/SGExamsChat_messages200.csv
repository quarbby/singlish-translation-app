text,group
but i hope people would heed my advice ah,btohqsg
So unfortunately furthest I can go is to Changi,btohqsg
No  JC more slack then poly. You can play around in. jc and not worry until the end,btohqsg
Tbh anywhr aft sec sch cfm got stress la,btohqsg
Bruh I'm worrying about secondary school and u say I no need worry about jc,btohqsg
I mean if I can achieve financial stability without having to undergo the stress of going to a jc then I’ll probably opt to not go jc,btohqsg
but your sec sch life is almost over,btohqsg
Then again im scared i scare kids so i wont go for ecde,btohqsg
Yea but if I suffer in secondary  wouldnt I suffer more in jc,btohqsg
In JC you have fewer subjects  less to worry,btohqsg
for people who prefer projects more than mugging,btohqsg
If u chao mugger u can excel in jc,btohqsg
Sounds like u had a great time in jc,btohqsg
If ur good at projects and all ull excel in poly,btohqsg
I've been mugging my entire life but I think it's rather unhealthy,btohqsg
Ye but not all abt mugging ig,btohqsg
er sry what is my username ah,btohqsg
is it my name or a username,btohqsg
Not really  they made it so watered down it made it confusing.But PW was fun though. Some people love it  others hate it. Same goes with economics,btohqsg
i have yet to study much,btohqsg
''Which is not an ambidentate ligand?'',btohqsg
But poly so inconvenient to go lmao,btohqsg
''explain why H2S-SBF6 can react with alkanes',btohqsg
Idk but commute time is so long,btohqsg
JC seems more convenient transportation wise,btohqsg
if you stay close to the poly than it won't be long,btohqsg
Depends which JC and where you live. Very hard to say,btohqsg
well   not everyone face the same problems as you,btohqsg
At this point I cant be picky lmao,btohqsg
Tbh ya true tho i wld sacrifice that for a course i like,btohqsg
Nanyang but not really interested in their courses,btohqsg
See whether I can even make it in lol,btohqsg
Who knows  you might do well in JC,btohqsg
Then why don't you reply immideately every time?,btohqsg
But is poly or jc harder? I know one is mug at the end and the other is consistency,btohqsg
I mean  if you want to sleep well  you still need to be consistent in JC,btohqsg
If you like to worry  then only study at the end,btohqsg
Neither can be said to be definitely harder,btohqsg
Welp I'm just gonna get my results and think about it then,btohqsg
Don't have much time by then. You might make a bad split second decision,btohqsg
Perhaps but with my current expectations  I'm better off retaining,btohqsg
I think it's a bug with the quizarium bot,btohqsg
Where some people can still see the buttons,btohqsg
Try deleting all the messages from Quizarium,btohqsg
I already asked John to delete the most recent one  last time,btohqsg
There is a checkbox to delete all,btohqsg
Here is one of the messages,btohqsg
But then who would know that John is the champion of Quizarium,btohqsg
Hi guys those who took N level last year or previous years  was ur grades reflected inside ur Singpass acc?,btohqsg
Never went there  heard teachers there are very good,btohqsg
progressives and republican both dislike bitch pelosi,btohqsg
People who ‘mug in the end’ in JC usually end up dying at a levels,btohqsg
Ok  let's not tease kumar anymore  sorry kumar,btohqsg
Must be all the offerings ur worshippers have been giving u,btohqsg
U mean I worshipped u Yao Teck?,btohqsg
Need me to call the polize,btohqsg
I'm burning my A level H2 Chem paper as offerings,btohqsg
anyone able to get the a lvl ppr tho?,btohqsg
Any brave soul wanna try this chem qn?,btohqsg
what is lewis acid base reaction,btohqsg
A Lewis acid is an acceptor of electrons,btohqsg
was i trying to say he is 'a student'  or an 'A student'?,btohqsg
Every reaction is either Lewis acid base or redox? So since there’s no change in ON means it shld be Acid base,btohqsg
Anyone pls share me the chem paper pls,btohqsg
i wanted to ask cos someone just rekted bell curve for the quiz,btohqsg
just needed to confirm cos i drew the mechanism out,btohqsg
The formation of water should already be a lewis acid and base,btohqsg
between H+ and OH- produced from o2- and H+,btohqsg
Wait i thot there is no such thing as H+ ions in acid,btohqsg
According to my chem O teacher he said that H+ is the wrong term,btohqsg
So is basically a subsitute ah,btohqsg
its just more or less accurate i guess,btohqsg
cos in reality the H+ will react with water to form H3O+,btohqsg
but like water is everywhere also,btohqsg
H3O+ is kind of a waste of time,btohqsg
It's just used to make things fancy,btohqsg
anyone have h2 maths paper frm today,btohqsg
anyone knows how much would be a safe score to get A in h2 math?,btohqsg
U got ur pay alr ?,btohqsg
They said hindu officers will get earlier coz of the deepawali and what not,btohqsg
This one we'll need to ask theother officer from our squad,btohqsg
Idk oso hahaha nvm ah i wait till the actual payday first,btohqsg
At least 90 i would say,btohqsg
Can change meh if u below 75 or what,btohqsg
Do u even know if its 75,btohqsg
Nvm yall wont get my point eitherways hahaha,btohqsg
99 for B  100 for A,btohqsg
This one I agree cos like scoring an A in H2 Maths is like getting almost everything correct,btohqsg
I would be extremely  extremely surprised if 50% of all candidates for H2 Maths got ‘almost everything correct’,btohqsg
Which is why A cannot be 90,btohqsg
Because 50% of people get A,btohqsg
okay thank you for your reassurance john,btohqsg
Dude I did well for H2 Maths (like almost all correct) and lost like at least 15 marks for both papers and I got a B,btohqsg
But then this is in 2018,btohqsg
I lost about 30mark in total Liao from paper 1 and 2,btohqsg
You don't even know your raw score  you can't say for sure how many marks you lost,btohqsg
I wouldn’t consider losing 15m per paper ‘almost all correct’,btohqsg
i think i’m at 70% total lol,btohqsg
this one should be A haha,btohqsg
True that but Ye... was the type who checks the answers side by side so Ye and I was in the batch with the most people taking A levels so bell curve,btohqsg
Anyways  everyone doesn't even know your raw score and it doesn't matter. Only the grade matters,btohqsg
Hi!  H2 math no ECF right?,btohqsg
There isn't a bell curve for A levels....,btohqsg
U see  everybody say different things,btohqsg
I lose 30m got B  I lose 45m got A,btohqsg
What people say here cannot be trusted,btohqsg
You can't say for sure how many marks you lost,btohqsg
Unless you have the marked script,btohqsg
The only truth is that there’s no certainty,btohqsg
I can say for sure how many final ans i didnt get,btohqsg
It is based on individual approximation and judgement,btohqsg
But that doesn't show the amount of marks lost. It is still pure guessing,btohqsg
Their own feel of the cohort standard,btohqsg
I guess experience comes from marking other ppl's work,btohqsg
My estimation for my uni math test turned out to be true also,btohqsg
But diff cohort different standard too right?,btohqsg
But Cambridge doesn't reveal their mark schemes  apart from the specimen paper. How would you know what is the mark scheme for that paper. Hard to say,btohqsg
Due to cohort size and spread of standard,btohqsg
Ya la but doesnt change much,btohqsg
Maths is like the easiest subject to estimate tbh,btohqsg
Every cohort feels their paper are the hardest,btohqsg
No. I felt mine was easy,btohqsg
Lol no. My cohort was easiest cos first batch of new syllabus,btohqsg
When the 2020 h2 math paper is easier than ur uni math mid terms,btohqsg
My PW teacher was the first batch of PW,btohqsg
Den she say almost everyone distinction or smt,btohqsg
Of course uni is harder... jc is a prereq,btohqsg
You want a level paper to be harder than ur uni paper arh,btohqsg
It is possible that a meteor will crash into your exam hall and give you 100 marks,btohqsg
My PW teacher didn't even do PW in JC,btohqsg
I meant that its possible that the cohort so good that such an event could happen but again very unlikely,btohqsg
Den how come the A need 80,btohqsg
Den bell curve means what  only a fix amount of people can get A?,btohqsg
Den moderation they also change the marks to get A?,btohqsg
I heard that PW is useless,btohqsg
It isn't that helpful for your future career  but it is helpful for you to get into university,btohqsg
I guess it teaches you how to work in a group that you may not like  and if group members don't do much.It also teaches you to some extent how to reference  trains your writing skills to some extent,btohqsg
The latter is needed in Uni,btohqsg
Ironically no. The former is more impt,btohqsg
For mathematics not really. maybe the final dissertation only,btohqsg
Anyhow write also can score ok,btohqsg
I think GP’s more that enough for the latter,btohqsg
The former... is the reason why a lot of people hate PW,btohqsg
I was happy that fewer people 'interfered' with my work. That's how I see it.,btohqsg
U cant run away from that in poly and uni if u know,btohqsg
Poly and uni have way more projects usually,btohqsg
Right now i alr have 2 projects,btohqsg
1 project in jc is nothing,btohqsg
The writing style in GP and PW is different,btohqsg
It’s literally what happens in real life,btohqsg
So either you can get used to it during PW or u can get culture shocked in the future,btohqsg
When I was doing an internship last year  all the adults have like weekly meeting to discuss plans and what to do and all  similar to PW,btohqsg
yeah  will always meet proj mates you dont like in work too,btohqsg
either you learn to get used to it now,btohqsg
or you suffer in the future,btohqsg
Time to calculate the probability of that happening,btohqsg
money can fall from sky and u dont need to study anymore,btohqsg
Needs to be a substantial amount for that to happen,btohqsg
The 8 is the cut off,btohqsg
Like eg 260 is the current cut off for a sch,btohqsg
So below 8 means can go anywhere,btohqsg
Guys could i ask a question its abt chem,btohqsg
Im just asking out of curiosity,btohqsg
What makes them so god damned stable,btohqsg
but most resonance structures arent as stable as benzene,btohqsg
the single bond adopts partial double-double bond character as a result,btohqsg
I heard the delocalised electrons like spread out the charges or smth,btohqsg
that stabilises the compound in terms of reducing the negative charge,btohqsg
but partially as a result of electron delocalisation the bond order of the bonding regions involved has an intermediate value,btohqsg
Wait so the lower the negative charge the more stable??,btohqsg
Oh yeah it's also why it makes nitrate ions and sulfate ions almost impossible to breakdown in electrolysis right,btohqsg
yes the more stable the compound if it is an anion,btohqsg
lol electrolysis can 'break' nitrate and sulfate meh,btohqsg
Cause nitrate has 2 resonance structures,btohqsg
for me non existence cuz my colleagues nice,btohqsg
but i heard from friends who kena damn bad ones,btohqsg
i dont think the correct word is breakdown,btohqsg
u mean reactive i guess  or oxidised haha,btohqsg
Bruh always confused me so fucking Much kqnfiwnfnebf,btohqsg
but ya tbh thats part of the reason  because their negative charges is extensively dispersed  so they aren't that reactive,btohqsg
but usually for most students they evaluate it in terms of the E knot values to determine reactivity,btohqsg
Ya I am definitely not taking H2 Chemistry,btohqsg
is not as intimidating as u think,btohqsg
tbh apart from physics  both h2 bio and h2 chem honestly don't need much pre-requisites,btohqsg
Ya it's just like any other subject like math,btohqsg
i think even then resonance wldnt rlly explain since electrolysis E nought vales arent fully dependent on stability of reactant / product,btohqsg
gibbs free energy by nernst eqn wld require you to take the other side into account,btohqsg
is impossible to explain all phenomenons,btohqsg
ya  better than staring at a calculator for the rest of my life,btohqsg
Wait ummm just one more question  im sorry im asking so much just interested,btohqsg
if only chem wasnt a central science,btohqsg
ok la but chem also have,btohqsg
i mean all sciences hv bio,btohqsg
Tf does gibbs free energy even fucking mean like okay there's the equation  delta G=delta H-(Temperature*Delta Entropy),btohqsg
defn is energy associated w a chem reaction to do work,btohqsg
Its the free enegy given out by a reaction,btohqsg
that can be used to do work*,btohqsg
Free energy is energy that can do useful work,btohqsg
Hi how do i do this,btohqsg
Which time do i take or do i find average of those timings,btohqsg
p sure you just consider .5,btohqsg
either that or my phys has gone horribly wrong,btohqsg
Just realised i sent to the wrong group too lol so sorry,btohqsg
Where did u get the 2.5 and 0.1,btohqsg
i wish i dropped phys honestly,btohqsg
That's gg to be u chemcer,btohqsg
no like sound rebounding off fish,btohqsg
Bio is so much memory ngl,btohqsg
Phy makes the most sense out of the 3 sci,btohqsg
thats why its a waste of time,btohqsg
ngl true but aft the basics settle then not much more memorisation,btohqsg
just a fuck ton of application,btohqsg
And istg if u wanna understand how it fully works its hell,btohqsg
Wtf dont u understand in that,btohqsg
quantum is im here  but im not,btohqsg
lol i forgot all my quantum chemistry knowledge alr,btohqsg
even tho i learnt it 1 month ago,btohqsg
like no joke other than p = ymc i dont see shit,btohqsg
1 month retention still p good,btohqsg
takes me abt 2 hours to drown the sorrows away,btohqsg
thats thinking a bit too far......,btohqsg
eh u legit in h3 bio?,btohqsg
i went for 1st round of SBO  and thats when i got sick of bio,btohqsg
i dont take h3 bio cause i not a lvl but the ppr isndoable and fun,btohqsg
ibo papers are the true fun,btohqsg
Just beg the principal and flex ur knowledge,btohqsg
Lmao JC gg to be the death of me istg 🤡,btohqsg
prob cause they think foundation req,btohqsg
uni is the ultimate curve ball,btohqsg
Lmao i die before i can reach there,btohqsg
Jay  so how much u got,btohqsg
if im at median  below median,btohqsg
u all dont know how grading works in uni,btohqsg
lmao see if i make it to uni first,btohqsg
tbh stress in jc p good ngl,btohqsg
u realise that uve been wasting ur life away and uni apps are a thing,btohqsg
i mean if u can deal w it i think its good,btohqsg
stress is motivation for the procrastinator,btohqsg
But if it's driving u insane,btohqsg
unless u like stress until cry at 3am eating noodles then,btohqsg
Make u feel not so good,btohqsg
I feel fear for what's to come,btohqsg
I read I feel scared sia,btohqsg
I scared they do smt silly,btohqsg
I gonna need to stock up,btohqsg
But yea  the stress is v subjective,btohqsg
i mean again if u can handle it  go ahead,btohqsg
I wonder what JC this is,btohqsg
U know as I was scrolling thru,btohqsg
They alr 3 year JC  4 year JC,btohqsg
Den some say they may 5 year JC or smt,btohqsg
Wait there's a 4 year JC,btohqsg
Or retain 1 year in MI,btohqsg
tbh 3 or 4 year jc is not certain death,btohqsg
There was one that said last year he took a level math he got E,btohqsg
Den he say this year also no hope liao,btohqsg
thr r alot of ppl who take 3rd and 4th year but sfill come out vv good,btohqsg
inb4 work life even more stress,btohqsg
My telomeres delete so fast i gonna,btohqsg
I can just imagine my body trying to keep up with the deletion HAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
these kinda posts make me sad,btohqsg
And we dk whose behind that and how to help them also,btohqsg
Other than leaving s nice comment,btohqsg
There's probs more of these ppl,btohqsg
Singapore education system  over emphasis on grades,btohqsg
Do i rrly wanna go into a JC?,btohqsg
I mean poly also have stress,btohqsg
but if u confconf know what uw to do,btohqsg
True but no cramming for a levels,btohqsg
Maybe JC more intense cos like it's only 2 year,btohqsg
The actual time is only 1.5 year,btohqsg
its alot more shotgun than poly i feel,btohqsg
The issue is like ppl can't seem to find what they truly passionate in yet at 16,btohqsg
U have a goal u get less stress,btohqsg
U dont have a goal good luck trying to handle a lvls,btohqsg
South Korea lmao heard they kinda like rrly stress there,btohqsg
They literally use gas tanks in china,btohqsg
I wouldn't be surprised if students actually collapse during the paper,btohqsg
tbh studying bio in chinese is such a good thing,btohqsg
because all names in bio in chinese will tell u what it is,btohqsg
like if udk which layer epidermis is,btohqsg
gee i wonder which it is,btohqsg
Try seeing the fucking periodic table,btohqsg
It wldnt hv made a difference if the english LC this year was conductes in english or chinese,btohqsg
He was so incomprehensible in english he might as well speak Chinese,btohqsg
Imagine listening to eminem on 5× speed,btohqsg
From trying so hard to pay attention,btohqsg
tbh during my a lvl year,btohqsg
i kept reading reddit to sustain my stamina for the rest of the papers. Had a good laugh also,btohqsg
during my year every single paper,btohqsg
''Is MI in the bell curve?'',btohqsg
yeah reddit sgexams got some toxic ppl,btohqsg
olvl redox titration this year legit fail vibe check,btohqsg
gg to hell for laughing so hard,btohqsg
uk the last mole qn for titration that no one got right?,btohqsg
yeah one cb go say like oh i got 1. smthn moles,btohqsg
which is prob the correct ans,btohqsg
when literally everyone was like dying,btohqsg
i legit cannot some guy went thru 2 full burettes and still insist not enuf,btohqsg
imagine the panic he gave ppl arnd him,btohqsg
u go on 11 Jan only to see that u got an A2 for every single subject and your L1R5 is 12 points,btohqsg
Like u go on stage and shit,btohqsg
The school announces i have 9 distinctions,btohqsg
My name is on the wall of stars,btohqsg
Technically for kcp u will still go on stage,btohqsg
uve won  but at what cost,btohqsg
Ms pang congragulates you for getting 18 points,btohqsg
"""u can go to a JC!""",btohqsg
I can imagine it in her voice,btohqsg
Everyone please recommend ur primary 6 friends here,btohqsg
There is literally NO good teacher there,btohqsg
Remember what happened to both of us?,btohqsg
"and we also hv MOE with ""Every School is a Good School""",btohqsg
i wld like to attribute the school for my wonderful performance,btohqsg
I would thank the school for my exponential emotional growth,btohqsg
In secondary school every school good,btohqsg
Whose this sec 2 guy 😂,btohqsg
Nah lets not ruin the name of our beautiful schoil,btohqsg
ok fine ill spill the beans,btohqsg
Sec 2 guy wanted to kill himself over homework,btohqsg
WE NEED MORE PPL FRM KCPSS,btohqsg
i did not see the laigh coming,btohqsg
U exaggerated it  it probs wasn't that baddddddddd,btohqsg
How much btr cld it hv sounded?,btohqsg
Bruh the guy legit wanted to,btohqsg
Dk the full story but it was something to do with a knife,btohqsg
Thanks for the story  we can stop here 😂,btohqsg
I like how my name is Tit i keep forgetting,btohqsg
And isit normal for a principal to be around for 20 years in the school?,btohqsg
Oh no i have accidentally been in power for 20 years,btohqsg
Oh no i have done it again,btohqsg
He will prob be in power his entire life but ok,btohqsg
But yes they shoukd invite titus to do an alumni talk,btohqsg
His secret police casually kill the head of opposition party,btohqsg
I would be so happy to express my joy from being in this school,btohqsg
The now sec 4 right btw,btohqsg
I thought you were objecting yo this hahaha,btohqsg
Prob tmr morning we wake up see results alrdy,btohqsg
I didn't follow the election  but I know trump made a mess,btohqsg
He trying to sue and asking them to stop counting or smt right,btohqsg
Trump made a mess with his entire,btohqsg
The entire thing was a joke,btohqsg
And he declare that he won if they count the legit vote or smt,btohqsg
And msnbc had to stop his speech from airing cause he was spreading fake news,btohqsg
Ytd I saw this funny post,btohqsg
They cut him off and the anchors were like 'wait no this is what actually haprpned',btohqsg
I can hear trump saying all those,btohqsg
MSNBC cuts away from Trump’s speech 35 seconds after starting due to too many lieshttps://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/jowpzn/msnbc_cuts_away_from_trumps_speech_35_seconds/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share,btohqsg
Are they trying to silence him now,btohqsg
Theyre stopping him ftom spreading misinformation,btohqsg
Freedom of speech is freedom of speech,btohqsg
Let the Americans discern for themselves,btohqsg
Considering the amount of votes red has,btohqsg
Trump proceeda to start a dictatorship,btohqsg
And how many pepple think theyre illegal votes,btohqsg
He takes tanks and surrounds it around bidens house,btohqsg
Tbh idg how is USA first world country sia,btohqsg
