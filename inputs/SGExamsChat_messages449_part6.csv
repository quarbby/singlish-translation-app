The gpa im getting at my poly...let’s just say  will mean I have to remod 3> at the 4 other poly’s,btohqsg
I like how there are like 2k ppl here but the active are like below 20,btohqsg
Diploma in digital design and development,btohqsg
Let’s say  I scored a “E” for Two ESE last sem,btohqsg
And a d for a msa,btohqsg
I always feel like I’m trolling the education system honestly,btohqsg
No honestly  like the results I have gotten from school the last 18 years of my life really speaks volumes,btohqsg
Like I have been so close to ending my education journey in the last 5 consecutive years,btohqsg
Give me a sec  I’ll show you,btohqsg
i think it means he still young,btohqsg
It means i am old already,btohqsg
This was my sec 3 report book,btohqsg
I went from A1 to F9,btohqsg
A1 to F9 I don’t think is,btohqsg
I forgot what I did in sec 3,btohqsg
Looking at these results idk how,btohqsg
The last three national exams I ever took   Psle N and O levels...if any of them  I scored just one point less...I would not have been in Na or Sec 5 or RP,btohqsg
I’ve always been a borderline student,btohqsg
education system before uni is weird,btohqsg
I’ve noticed one thing about it,btohqsg
You can keep failing but still can progress,btohqsg
i’ve voiced my opinion on it here quite a few times lol,btohqsg
You can keep failing subjects in sec school  but they won’t kick you out,btohqsg
Idk abt ite so I can't sau,btohqsg
as in it’s just not a good system lol,btohqsg
Ohyeah it's complicated to explain ngl,btohqsg
Something l have always thought about is how NA is just a more glorified NY,btohqsg
lol i don’t even fully understand all the paths myself tbh,btohqsg
The amount of people that would eventually go ITE/Poly in nt is always heavily favoured to ite,btohqsg
the streaming from PSLE is a joke anyway,btohqsg
I roughly do but don't as well,btohqsg
80 students went to NA...we had the largest NA Cohort in 10 years so  our cohort were split into 3 classes,btohqsg
50+ went ite after n levels  6 went to poly ...over 20 went sec 5,btohqsg
i rmb my year psle they still showed the lowest aggregate,btohqsg
but they removed in like 2012 change i think,btohqsg
My sch didn't show score at all,btohqsg
Bruh I still rmb ...everyone was saying how my psle was the hardest in a decade,btohqsg
Sec they show how many dists,btohqsg
my sch generally do well for psle,btohqsg
Bro  my school did the sec 5’s dirty when I was a sec 5,btohqsg
Mooooood thus drop out to do private,btohqsg
All of us were in the hall  they proceeded to show the whole o levels cohort that over 50% of students failed to pass 3 or more subjects,btohqsg
is the dumbest shit in the world,btohqsg
But the issue here was  we only had one sec 5 class,btohqsg
And they showed the sec 5 cohort,btohqsg
i just have a hate for them deciding that some students can’t handle o levels based on this,btohqsg
The moment I saw the psle grading system...I knew we were doomed  y’all seen it yet?,btohqsg
If you scored a 46  you see in the same range as someone that scored a 64,btohqsg
No wonder  in the last 10 years...sg closed over 100 schools,btohqsg
Over 30 of them were sec schools,btohqsg
