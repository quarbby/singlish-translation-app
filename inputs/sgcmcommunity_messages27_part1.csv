"people minds will go crazy ""WOW LIFETIME ATF? DRIVE LIKE A EURO CAR WITH JAPANESE RELIABILITY""",btohqsg
Surely:) thatâ€™s the main purpose of Porsche,btohqsg
Honestly tht few months might just be left with repairs etc so might not be worth it if u plan on dereg aft tht,btohqsg
Must find a good unit and inspect well,btohqsg
Cayenne might be safer than a panamera. Many panameras close to end of term or renewals are quite abused with cheap mods and no proper maintenance,btohqsg
Since Cayenne is an SUV  modsters who don't maintain the car properly tend to stay away,btohqsg
Well they're meant to be a large SUV or an executive sedan,btohqsg
If you want a fast one  can look into Cayenne/panamera GTS,btohqsg
You get the V8 with those  120hp more,btohqsg
I just want the cheapest cayenne or Panamera left few months. For the badge only,btohqsg
Cheapest might save you money with the initial purchase,btohqsg
If only Volvo was priced the same as Mazda i will be over the moon,btohqsg
But you'll be ridden with bills on maintenance  so do keep that in mind before jumping in. Get a unit that can last you those few months at least,btohqsg
if i am not wrong it is the same overseas,btohqsg
But cayenne n Panamera r also v boring. Should I get a bmw 6 series cabriolet instead? More fun,btohqsg
Upto you Mr Nissan. Whatever your heart wants,btohqsg
Cabriolet girls like. They like to take selfie in cabriolet,btohqsg
what is inside that matters most Mr Nissan,btohqsg
The aim should be that they take selfie with you not the car,btohqsg
But bmw donâ€™t have the powerful badge like Porsche,btohqsg
You want to pick up people  buy a cheap boxster,btohqsg
Itâ€™s a very fugly car tbh,btohqsg
But it'll get you what you want,btohqsg
Cayenne isBIG  COMFORTABLE and fast is depending on how you useITðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
If you put the rear seats down  basically a queen sized bed,btohqsg
But cannot lower down roof. Not fun,btohqsg
V slow bro. 0 to 100kph in 7.8s,btohqsg
For the price u pay  u r shortchanged,btohqsg
Depends on what youâ€™re seeking sir.,btohqsg
exactly can use it to haul different type of goods,btohqsg
bmw 640 0 to 100kph already 5.5s,btohqsg
LOL bro drive whatever you want.. you probably wont impress anybody after u sell it for a few months,btohqsg
Depends on what youâ€™re after sir.,btohqsg
legit so many cayennes  macans  640s... singaporeans are too rich already you are not gonna impress anybody,btohqsg
say real just buy a car that makes YOU happy,btohqsg
I want fun  fast n brand,btohqsg
what price are you looking at,btohqsg
If that is number one your list  you already have the answer youâ€™re seeking,btohqsg
but not worth ah ur monthly cfm high,btohqsg
one month can buy one set of bbs,btohqsg
Maybe I should quit my job,btohqsg
So I wonâ€™t buy a car to show off,btohqsg
Once budget is set  everything falls into place naturally.,btohqsg
Put that cayenne badge on your Nissan,btohqsg
You need to rejig your life goals,btohqsg
Or do we live to work,btohqsg
If showing off means getting the highest Torque number for the most reasonable buck,btohqsg
If I hv no frens n colleagues  I wonâ€™t buy a car to show off,btohqsg
He has the answer to the perfect torque car for you.,btohqsg
even if you buy any of these cars for a few months to show off,btohqsg
