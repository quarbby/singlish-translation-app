Notice how pre-Covid  PanU stock matched steadily higher towards 42c level  only to immediately slump to 25.5c when stop work orders where imposed?From chart above  one notices the gradual recovery has again begun  now pushing to retest the recent 1st recover rally high of 32.5cOnce crossed above that mark  PanU will have eked out a bullish right triangle angle. Should a high volume breakout ensue  the way opens up for retesting the Feb peak of 42cVested.WarrenWarren,btohqsg
A network partner did a deep dive intoPanUnited& with his permission sharing it here ðŸ‘‡,btohqsg

For those interest to know more on PanUnited  can refer to the above got more info.I will be keeping this one and believe this should give me close to 50% returns in less than 2 years.Letâ€™s see. ðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg

My take is whoever making the volume on PanUnited is planning to do the final accumulation $0.275 to $0.285 before making the push up.Whoever want to buy this  make sure have strong hands. Not for contra.,btohqsg

Means Tiger can only short own holdings?,btohqsg
Yup  I do like the fundamentals of PanUnited and strong management team IMO.,btohqsg
