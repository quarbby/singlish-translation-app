This type is professional type   cause they know a lot of ppl will cut in Thier lane   and they won’t need to brake the car,btohqsg
Slow is being empathetic. Fast is being aggressive,btohqsg
They basically leave a big gap for ppl to cut,btohqsg
Yeah. Prefer to do jam brakes 🫢,btohqsg
But how to cut when they drive slower then middle lane,btohqsg
Then those behind will realise too late,btohqsg
Very hard   cut lane easiest is to be fast,btohqsg
Cut right side is just to brush the car,btohqsg
Not just being fast. With the necessary torque any car can do it,btohqsg
Bascially hogger disrupt the flow of traffic and cause congestion,btohqsg
Not true. They will tell you there is no reasons to rush,btohqsg
Stand infront of them at the escalator and be on the right instead of left and they will said excuse me,btohqsg
Then said no reason to rush,btohqsg

ya but the higher models get some tweaks js like how the bogo spec e classes are diff frm the actual decent ones,btohqsg
uh not much ah if u ask me,btohqsg
A-Class is okay la  if i was looking to enter conti  i think its a good buy at the right price,btohqsg
good place to enter conti would be f40 1 series too,btohqsg
or vw cos peoples car 🫶🏼,btohqsg
if volvo is the best manchester united is the best team in europe,btohqsg
You need Mrs Tan to teach you how to form proper sentences cos i catch no balls,btohqsg
