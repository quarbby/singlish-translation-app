Link citi reward to amaze to earn 4mpd for hospital,btohqsg
Watch Chris’ video and consider your spending habits should be fine.,btohqsg
Yes  miles for me is useless because I seldom travel. Instead  cash rebate may be more useful.,btohqsg
So many people are experts on miles. I don't know how to convert miles into dollars.,btohqsg
Cash all the way. Plus  I don't like having stray points in virtual wallets. Feels like fruit hanging off a tree that you can't obtain.,btohqsg

Hi i was thinking to use XNAP to link to my ocbc card to earn 6% rebate. Seems like the MCC for restaurants and foodcourt is different. Is there a way to earn 6% dining from hawker?,btohqsg
Use HSBC revo or UOB Evol..,btohqsg
do note you can also arrange to pay progressively instead of a lumpsum. so for example you can pay $2k each per month to earn the UOB one cashback. but need to plan and pay in advance before the banquet.,btohqsg
I yes  already planning for that thanks,btohqsg
uob now also give an airpod if you pay $6000. but limited redemptions.,btohqsg

What's the difference between webull  moomoo trading compared to Philip  DBS  Stanchartered  Lim and tan? When we buy stocks from webull and moomoo  will our sg stocks be showed inside the cdp? If our stocks are showed in cdp  can we sell them via webull and moomoo? I called cdp and I was told that the sg stocks that are seen inside cdp has to transfer out. I was told that cdp is just a holding place so need to transfer out if want to sell via webull or moomoo? But no need if sell through Philip  DBS  stanchart or lim and tan?? What is the logic?,btohqsg
Hi All  how can I collect miles for SP group bill and SingTel bill?,btohqsg
Diff is it is owned by them but they hold for you(custodian account)DBS  UOB have direct to CDP account  your name is written into the company's shareholders book. Thus Higher fees,btohqsg

hi everyone.. is anyone facing similar situation where uob is taking a long time to mail out the cards upon card approval?,btohqsg
its been almost a week and still i havent received the card,btohqsg
Yes. Normal due to swift syndrome.,btohqsg
Local brokers' commission tend to be higher.,btohqsg
im asking mainly due to the prvi miles promotion period states that it will be 2 months upon card approval to clock 1k in each of the two months. so im already losing 1 week. not sure if they will be gracious to extend the date if i call in,btohqsg
I mean it’s normal application and delivery delay stuff albeit delayed due to swift.,btohqsg
yeah but i feel 1 week is quite long,btohqsg
Hi Everyone.Want to check with you all  about how safe it will be if I invest using MooMoo with the Fullerton fund.,btohqsg
Normal already slow now with swifty Even slower,btohqsg
Can we pay road tax by citi payall or cardup? I could not find such payment options and checking here with the experts on the best method of paying road tax. Many thanks in advance.,btohqsg
my card took 2.5 months to arrive  and that was way before the whole taylor swift thing... and they will not extend any promo dates even though the card delay is on them,btohqsg
applied in end feb only came in mid may LOL,btohqsg
my friend just told me  his came today. applied last monday.,btohqsg
quite a number of people faced problems with uob  but if you wanna check on the cards promo  need to contact the rewards team instead of the credit card team  apparently are different,btohqsg
but its just one generic number to speak to customer service officer right?,btohqsg
yeah... they only provide one number to call LOL then the cs person gna tell u that they'll pass the case to the rewards team to get them to get back to you... but whether they get back to you or not is also another story :'),btohqsg
Pay with paypal using uob absolute,btohqsg
for the DBS Woman’s World card does it have a min spend to qualify for the 10x point for online shopping ?,btohqsg
Why r u surprised  UOB has the most subtle take your money conditions,btohqsg
for the DBS Woman’s World card  within the calendar month if i spend the first 2k on offline purchase(2k cap hit) and on a later date spend another 2k online purchase do i still get the 10x point for the 2k online purchase or it would be consider offline spend ?,btohqsg
Good question. You called in to cs. The cs will advice you best to ask the merchant itself.,btohqsg
I will also like to know what purchase fall under qualify category.Previously i called in to cs. They informed me that all my previous purchases are not qualify for the cashback.,btohqsg
Nope but u need to check if it is in block of $5 spend,btohqsg
Online bonus point only for online  if u spend offline u get based point,btohqsg
Your purchases from these merchants look eligible. CSO might be smoking you,btohqsg
Hi I was wondering too  did you get any answer for this?,btohqsg
That what I think of at first.Called in to the credit card department. They told me not qualify as the merchant codes is different. All depend on the merchant. Best to check with the merchant.However  out of goodwill they extended the deadline for me.,btohqsg
Think they mistaken with yuu merchants. I spent all on lazada and qualified,btohqsg

Thanks. Is there other options for me to check other than call in? Or is there a reward department for me to check?,btohqsg
thanks for reply  so the 2k cap on points u can earn is solely for online spend right? that mean offline spend wont deduct from the 2k cap right?,btohqsg

I have DBS altitude visa and altitude Amex cards. I want to cancel Amex version and I do have points inside. DBS cards points don’t pool when it comes to card cancellation right? Have to transfer out points in DBS altitude Amex before cancellation right?,btohqsg
Hi  any idea where are the best places to park cash (say $50k to $150k) for highest interest  and have some form of liquidity?,btohqsg
Hi is it possible to own DBS altitude visa and altitude Amex at the same time? Asking because each card has a bonus cap of $5000 spend a month and I might be spending more than that  so considering to get the other one as well,btohqsg

Amaze+ CRMC can be added to Gpay  apple pay  Xnap  etc...Depends on what are the payment systems the merchant can accept as well...,btohqsg
Thank you. Any idea how many days for payment to go through,btohqsg
I don’t use this feature so I can’t advise. But@ChrisHMSGrecently shared on this in the video but I don’t think he mentioned turn around time for transaction to be settled.If u set it up right  the trigger should be from IRAS. And IRAS usually triggers income tax around 5-6th of the month and if that deduction fails they will try again around 20th I think. It’s on their FAQ page.If u don’t see the deduction done  IRAS advised to log into IRAS using SingPass then check pending payments.U might want to manually pay if this happens as it might take some time for the set up between Citi and IRAS to take into effect. Manual paying during this transition is to avoid penalty imposed by IRAS for late payment.,btohqsg
can I just use the amaze card directly for payment? will I get the cashback that way?,btohqsg
I’m sharing with u this as I recently set up paying of my income tax with HSBC EGA. So u and me are in similar situation just that we using different means to pay.,btohqsg
U can use physical amaze card but make sure u link the default master card in the app to the correct MasterCard before u make payment.,btohqsg
I see this way  I will be able to get the 10x points?,btohqsg
U use amaze to convert transactions to online spend right?That’s after u link the your Citi rewards to amaze and have that as default card right?So if u set up already  u can just spend on the amaze card and it will auto charge to your Citi rewards card and u can log into Citibank app later to check.If u never set up correctly  u can’t even charge the spending to amaze. The transaction on amaze will decline mah,btohqsg

No one has help me in this question… can someone pls help. Thanks,btohqsg
If it works the same way as vantage. Then yes need to cancel first,btohqsg
yes  need to redeem points from Dbs altitude Amex. Assuming u redeeming miles  can select to redeem from the card and charge the redemption fee to it to use the points on dbs altitude amex before dbs altitude visa. However if u have dbs wwmc also  points on dbs wwmc will gave to be redeemed fully first before using points on dbs altitude amex  all can be done in a redemption paying fee once.,btohqsg
Thanks. Can I redeem miles just in DBS Altitude Amex only without redeeming the miles in WWMC?,btohqsg
Maybe also look at milelion’s post on the DBS auto conversion program. Seems like got use for you here if you already converting. If you have other DBS cards  and have intention to convert within the year  will be a good plan to have I think,btohqsg
cannot  points expiring earlier will be redeemed first,btohqsg
just need to pay one time fee ah  dun see why need auto program especially if want to keep points on alt visa,btohqsg
About 2-2.5 months for me. The amount will be credited into your credit card. Didn’t receive any notification from DBS,btohqsg
Cause personally don’t believe in storing points for too long. Usually my points will clear within 1-2 years.But still thinking whether I want to sign up for the programme. 😂,btohqsg

Here’s my humble sharing. Maybe not be the best. Don’t bash me 😄,btohqsg
I have only 10k miles in altitude Amex. You mean I charge the conversion fee back to Amex? But I am cancelling the card  can still charge it? How do I then make payment next month if the amex card already cancelled?,btohqsg
pay the fee and whatever charged to the card before u cancel.,btohqsg
What do you mean by per month 18th ?,btohqsg
Ignore it. That’s my own cc billing cycle haha,btohqsg
Hi all is citi pay all worth it to pay abt 50k of renovation? Cause still need to pay the admin fee of 2.2%,btohqsg
Yes if u participate in the current 2.2mpd payall promo. Please read the tnc carefully to avoid disappointment.,btohqsg
depends if you are working to accumulate miles,btohqsg
then  I'll go for citi payall  you may need to increase your citi limit is below 95% of 50K,btohqsg
ok. noted. thanks for the reminder.,btohqsg
hmm not sure they will. another way is to overpay into the credit card right,btohqsg
even for my wedding  i am feeling i sign up for the wrong card for citibank - currently citi rewardsthinking need to sign up premier miles.unfortunately not earning 120k yet to get vantage or lady solitre,btohqsg
No worries la. The best 4 mpd cards are not those 120K cards. 🙂,btohqsg
hahah okok...this miles games make me sweat abit,btohqsg
Hi guys  I applied for uob lady’s solitaire card last Wednesday  and I received an email telling me that I need additional information(my work pass  passport and additional information form) for uob. I don’t see any upload button and additional information form on uob website under the construction on that email. Is anyone experiencing the same issue?,btohqsg
Had the same thing except via a call and they gave meuob.com/cliwhich is just for increasing the credit limit.I called in again and they gave me an email address to submit my documents to. Haven’t heard back since last Thursday,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing your experience  I’m thinking go to uob branch this weekend if no one reply me email  such bad cs from uob…,btohqsg
They might reach out to you via email/ phone  you may provide your supporting docs then!,btohqsg
If you have the reference ID you may try this as well,btohqsg
I have tried but all I have is this page,btohqsg
Yea uob CS has never been the best but this volume clearly is overloading them. All my recent calls were met with tired and fairly rude CS and pray hard that they do not transfer you - I waited for almost 30 mins to speak to the CS only to be put on hold for another 30 mins to be transferred to the cards team,btohqsg
On laptop is the same page  there is no upload button apparently.,btohqsg
Yes they are experiencing some hard time with ts concert and lady card open to all gender I understand them. But they make me feel like that their teams are not in sync  because the instructions on the email is not working on the website.,btohqsg
If you have HSBC Advance... $2k above 2.5% cap at $70 cash back.. so max roughly can charge up to $2800,btohqsg
I read somewhere that payall cannot use overpay method,btohqsg
try to ask for higher limit  you can request from the app,btohqsg
Does HSBC advance able to pay for insurance ? I have 18 000 insurance fees to pay at end of year.,btohqsg
Does grab paylater  a bnpl service will affect my credit score if i’m late on a payment? Ty 🐱,btohqsg
I think if you miss a payment it may affect,btohqsg
No credit checks till u exceed 2k it says i dont know 🙈,btohqsg
UOB just doesn't pick up the phone lol. Almost 40 mins before they transferred me to the premium queue. Then after waiting for another 30 mins the line cut off straight away. ... Guess I probably wouldn't sign up for the UOB lady solitaire card after all,btohqsg
their phone service is quite a nightmaretheir chat service still ok,btohqsg
their chat service can't really solve much tbh if u have more pressing issues,btohqsg
Doesn't work. Can only do max 95% of permanent credit limit. Overpay and charge will still fail.,btohqsg
haven touch dbs for a long time liao,btohqsg
seem like HSBC Revo promo start of the year Singsaver is paying out,btohqsg
Standard C is one of the fastest via phone but cards not that popular,btohqsg
How the credit it ah? To your bank account or to the credit card?,btohqsg
Finally received $300 for HSBC revo from SingSaver (Jan promo),btohqsg
As easy as 123 …. Go to your app and click on accounts at the bottom. Then click on the credit card with the fees. Once there select the tab ‘settings’ then ‘waive fees’,btohqsg
No... sad to say most CC do not give cashback for Insurance payment  same go to all taxes payment except UOB Amex..  yet insurance merchants do not accept payment from Amex 😑 no luck at all.,btohqsg
Should I put all my saving in Fullerton fund ?,btohqsg
Never put all your savings Into one fund,btohqsg
dont put all your eggs in one basket,btohqsg
"Gotta wait for the next ""grabpay""",btohqsg
Never put your savings outside of savings in the first place lol. Savings is savings  investment is investment. Split the pie when you budget  keep what's needed as your emergency fund as an emergency fund  the remaining for your investment or whatever.,btohqsg
I thought Singapore Fullerton fund 0% risk ?,btohqsg
And only for card  not account service,btohqsg
Dbs inbox also better  ocbc worse  uob not exist 😀,btohqsg
Don’t see any taker yet 🙂,btohqsg

curious can anyone walk in to RP - republic poly and go to the food court and buy food? even if im not a student there,btohqsg
nearly risk free doesn't mean 0% risk  on rare occasions the value of the fund may dip slightly,btohqsg
Meaning that there is possibility you will receive negative profits?,btohqsg
where got such thing as 0 risk and guaranteed returns higher than deposit rates,btohqsg
T bills risk free rate already 4%  why bother with banks?,btohqsg
There is no such thing as risk free in this world. Even banks need the SDIC insurance. If 0 risk why need deposit insurance?,btohqsg
I mean is the risk same as deposit money as saving in account?,btohqsg
Can I check does buying ShopBack e-vouchers or Favepay e-cards count as Dining Category spend under UOB Lady’s card ?,btohqsg

hi can i check if the categories still need to be within when using citirewards + amaze? example: I just paid for school fees about which is about 600+ with amaze  but i dont think I got 10x points  is it because the school fee isn’t within the 10x spend category?,btohqsg
education mcc is excluded in citi rewards TnC,btohqsg
ahh ok  so the transactions have to be within the spend category + online to get 10x points?,btohqsg
about the same  the risk for MMF is if everyone sells the fund all at once  it will collapse.,btohqsg
happened twice in 50 years of history,btohqsg
"bank run  there's a SDIC insurance to protect u.fund ""bank run""  nothing to save u",btohqsg
Sounds like the oil crisis or the Pound devaluation.,btohqsg
U need to check exclusion list,btohqsg
sdic can cover up to 75k for each bank if bank run,btohqsg
Just need to be not in exclusion list. Amaze already converted to online.,btohqsg

Endowus? They got that Amundi USD MMF  not bad also,btohqsg
Anyone got use ADDX or Funding Societies ?,btohqsg
Go see the sharpe ratio of various MMF,btohqsg
Looks like amaze is going the way of grab soon.,btohqsg
true .. but i still prefer using linked credit card instead of putting money into wallet,btohqsg
I'm building an automation platform for fixed income management.  Looking to integrate to a broker API.Anyone have good suggestions for a broker with low fees on T-Bills  Gov bonds and Corporate bonds?  Prefer to support minimum SGD & USD market  even better if other markets too.,btohqsg
OK I give you the sharpe ratios. first one is Fullerton SGD Cash Fund. Second one is United SGD MMF,btohqsg
So far Fullerton always positive since incorporated?,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Which platform do you recommend buying the Fullerton fund?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  can someone here that buys T bills with DBS iBanking advise me. The auction date was 6 July and subsequently I got a partial refund for my application but the interest hasnt been credited till today. On their website  they state it will take about 1-2 business days but it has already been more than that,btohqsg
about 250k and refund of 12k,btohqsg
yes I did non-comp. Is it usually given together in one transaction? Because previously did with OCBC they give it in 2 separate transactions  one refund one interest,btohqsg
guys if i link prvimiles to instarem and spend overseas it will give me 2.4 or 1.2 miles per dollar? because instarem charges the card in sgd right so is it true i won’t get foreign currency spend?,btohqsg
Instarem Amaze NERF for Card-linked payments  starting 1 Aug 2023: 💫💴 Instarem Amaze Code: NhkWBHhttps://hmsg.link/amaze- Amaze card-linked transactions in foreign currency will earn 0.5 InstaPoints (0.5% rebate) per S$1 spend- No change to InstaPoints earned on amaze transactions linked to amaze wallet (1% rebate)- E.g. Spending SGD 100 in foreign currency will earn 50 InstaPoints effective 1 Aug 2023  instead of 100 InstaPoints previously👉 Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysg👉 More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
The real nerf is if CWMC don’t acknowledge Amaze as eligible transaction. That way Amaze is going to die like all the AMEX card.,btohqsg
Unit trust level has fees. Some fees are passed on to brokers,btohqsg
I see . so buying SG Fullerton fund   no fees all ?,btohqsg
For moneyowl Fullerton fund  how they credit the interest ? Daily or monthly?,btohqsg
No  only fund level fees. Value is based on fund NAV,btohqsg
Basically the fund manager will take some cash from the fund to pay for expenses. This will be reflected in the NAV,btohqsg
Brokers earn via trailer fees  sort of like a commission which the fund house/manager passes on to the brokers for helping to sell their products,btohqsg
Hi if I pair citi rewards cc with xnap and pay for hawker food do I get 4mpd?,btohqsg

Sharing my Syfe Reit+ performance after 1 year (actually I have it for 2 years already). DCA $100 every month cos low confidence in it since it's always been negative PnL even after dividends. Anyone in the same situation?,btohqsg
yes my Reits+ portfolio is also -ve,btohqsg
I checked mine too.. also credited. I tot it will reflect a credit balance but it's not. So I tot it is not credited until I tap into the card entry to see.,btohqsg
Loss: -$133 (inclusive of +$170 dividends)Invested: $3.1kAs you can see  orange line is always below blue line. I don't know if Im doing something wrong,btohqsg
0.5 instapt for $1 on instaram..whoever still use this card...a real douche,btohqsg
40k in reits on syfe... divident 4k+ but -2k+++,btohqsg
Yea I can't believe after factoring in dividend gains  Im still at a loss!,btohqsg
will FO the moment it tuen green even its 0.1cents.,btohqsg
and we r paying their mthly salary,btohqsg
😂 I waiting for that day to come since 1 year but still haven't come,btohqsg
You might have bought in at the high which explains why till now is still in the -ve,btohqsg
Why don't buy Fullerton fund ?,btohqsg
I DCA consistently for 2 years so  it must have been a bull run for the past 2 years…? :/,btohqsg
This is reits  cant be compared with stocks in USX. Lets take a look at the returns for C38U (which is the largest holding in reits+) for the past 2 years from today  its down 11.21% (exclude dividends) so yea not a bull run,btohqsg
I entered in around Sept 22 and including diviends i am in the +ve  so its all about time you enter,btohqsg
It depends on the hidden fees/spreadSyfe is getting.Also We are in an interest rate increasing period  putting downward pressure on reit prices. Thus so far minor lost is still understandable. Once interest rate reverse  the prices are more likely to go up as people demand a lower yield.,btohqsg
"a quick check shows that syfe charges 1.98 per trade. so when u DCA in  if im not wrong each fee equates to around 1.5% of your buy in. There might be additional ""For Syfe Wealth investment portfolios  our fees range from 0.35% to 0.65% per year "".I dont use Syfe so not exactly sure of their fee structure.",btohqsg
I think syfe reit+ only charge management fee  and not fee per trade,btohqsg
So I guess it's just 0.35-0.65% then.,btohqsg
no  unless u using Amaze+citi rewards mc via googlepay on Android phone,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. My strategy is the same as yours. 😉👍🏻 one question  for NTUC app to pay for Kopitiam food  you use HSBC revolution or DBS WWC?,btohqsg
what’s the best alternative now after amaze’s nerf? Youtrip/trust? Anyone pushing their future fx transactions before 1st aug haha,btohqsg
The best alternative is still Amaze. Unless their FX spread exceeds 3.25%  you still come off better using Amaze + CRMC vs using another 4 mpd card like UOB VS,btohqsg
Just got out of a financial rut a few months ago. If CBS got default record  really is die die need wait 3 years for it to clear before can apply CC with any other banks beside trust?,btohqsg
Hi gurus. Any idea which card including dbs live fresh allows us to earn rewards when renewing safra membership?,btohqsg
Is simply go transactions considered as online spend? Or is there any method to make simple go to become online transaction? Example Apple Watch? Target is for SC journey card to get the 3mile per dollar,btohqsg
1. Get CIMB CC in Malaysia (if freq) for the best exchange rate (way better than Amaze)2. Youtrip.,btohqsg
HSBC revolution or UOB one or standard chart smart is recommended?,btohqsg
Likely uob will never approve u. Uob known for being very conservative. Black mark = forever reject,btohqsg
Different use for all. Should get all if use UOB one deposit accountSCB smart for some fast food (Macs &BK) and public transport as high cashback for those 6%HSBC Revo for travel and other general spend (eg. Retail)UOB one for bills/everyday groceries etc and to pair w UOB one account,btohqsg
Forever as in after it gets removed from CBS? Or until there's no default records?,btohqsg
Can I check is there any cards that I can earn miles for paying M1 phone bill? Thank you.,btohqsg
Haha I cannot answer u on this but from what I know. Uob remembers forever. As long as it knew.Heard an incident about someone who was a guarantor for a corporate loan by uob and the company went bust  that person was not approved any credit facilities in his personal name by uob forever.,btohqsg
For all you know. Maybe the person still owed money to Uob or UOB had to take a huge write-off on this potentially asset light company.,btohqsg
Yeah for sure uob lost money on the corporate loan,btohqsg
Hello! Does anyone know if Airbnb counts as travel spend?,btohqsg

I have dbs altitude and dbs woman's world card,btohqsg
Hey guys  do we need to pop by the branch for HSBC to verify signature if we want to do credit card giro payments?,btohqsg
https://milelion.com/2017/10/04/protip-ensure-dbs-womans-card-online-bonus-points-credit-properly/Airbnb should work for DBS wwmcNot sure  about 3mpd on altitude if coded via MCC or whitelisted,btohqsg
Legend  also thanks for the link too I never knew I that I can request for itemized points from dbs,btohqsg
Verify or update signature?If update must be physical branch  not sure about verifying signature for egiro though  believe that's for banks to do (I can be wrong on this),btohqsg
I was crawling telegram history to find out more about setting up HSBC EGA giro payments for credit cards. Saw ppl mentioned that they had to go physical branch to complete the set up 'cause when the bank account was created  it was using singpass and tehre was no signature in their record?,btohqsg
Anybody knows if there's a guide to setting up HSBC ega giro for citibank cc? haha,btohqsg
This is true. Overall idea is if your account no signature  must go down to branch,btohqsg
It take $4000 spending to hit the minimum foreign spend in 3mths or else your points will be gone.😂It as good as nerfing entirely.,btohqsg
I think can just treat the instapts as irrelevant now.. be glad that still got 4MPD to take,btohqsg

Oh yeap I tried like 4 times mailing them the giro for ega until HSBC called me say need go bank update signature cause online sign up no signature,btohqsg
Instapoints expire after 12 months so have that time to reach $4000 spend.,btohqsg
can try secured card if you want  placed fd as collateral,btohqsg
Anyone know if I were to use UOB Lady’s card (travel) with Instarem  then pay my hotel bill with foreign currency  will I still get 6MPD if the hotel is overseas?,btohqsg
yes if u meant using Amaze card linked to uob lady's card,btohqsg
So overseas spend under travel would still qualify for 6MPD yea?,btohqsg
yes  so long mcc is eligible,btohqsg
Is mcc global? Sorry if it’s a noob question,btohqsg
not really sure what u asking. MCC is merchant category code,btohqsg
Like do overseas merchants also use the same MCC as our merchants here in sg basically,btohqsg
each merchant has its own MCC for master/visa/amex etc.  all merchants follow same mcc system,btohqsg
Roger! So it’s an international system in a sense then?,btohqsg
ya  can useheymax.aito check the MCC for the hotel and check if it falls under the travel category for uob lady card,btohqsg
Non guarantee especially in Japan. Other countries usually use International standard mcc code.,btohqsg

Coinbase quietly reintroduced fees to USDC purchases. When confronted on support  they claim that this has always been the case  and only advanced trading no fees. Shared with them the announcement made 2 months ago  as well as transaction IDs made recently that showed no fees. Still copy pasted the same response.I then shared with them that Singapore has their own false advertising laws  Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act (CPFTA). Support says will raise to superior team. Then after a while  says that they will reply back via email  I sent a message asking them for an estimated turnaround time  and they just ended the convo there.,btohqsg

why uob lady for mortgage via cardup?,btohqsg
Does card up still works on dbs altitude? The tnc says cardup transactions are excluded,btohqsg
It's under point m. In the tnc pdf,btohqsg
Cardup + UOB Lady for mortgage may not be a good choice because you only earn base miles(0.4mpd). Maybe UOB PRVI (1.4mpd) is a better option.Is my understanding Correct?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know if miles can be stacked this way?1. Krisflyer UOB account (savings account)2. Krisflyer UOB Credit Card3. Kris+ App purchases,btohqsg
Sorry  I meant UOB prvimiles. 😅😅,btohqsg
Omg… 😮 I didn’t know that… thank you for the minder. 🤓🙏🏻,btohqsg
Anyone has a BOC debit card which expired before? May I know if the bank will automatically send you a new card or I have to go down to the branch to request for a new one?,btohqsg
You are absolutely correct. I actually meant my UOB prvimiles. Thank you for reminder 😁🙏🏻,btohqsg
Hmm  keeps saying card not eligible. Can anyone confirm?,btohqsg
why SimplyGo (DBS Altitude) for mrt?,btohqsg
Smart credit card from SC is best without minimum spending,btohqsg
which TnC u referring to? DBS rewards?,btohqsg
Damn getting scammed by coinbase 🥲,btohqsg
Yes   just checked they are charging fee now. Earlier sgd to usdc was free,btohqsg
What would be the alternative for this?,btohqsg
i'm now exploring miles instead of cashback strategy.. can someone point me to where i can read up more on how Amaze card can help reduce fx costs and help with my miles strategy? thanks in advance!!,btohqsg
Have you looked at the videos by HoneyMoney or articles from Milelion?,btohqsg

For the Citi plus promo. Under clause 5ii (c)  anyone knows what the primary relationship denotes? Does it apply for people who had a citi credit card in the past 13 months?,btohqsg
how does the cardup mortgage strategy work?,btohqsg
"Just double check where I found it.It inside the PDF for titled ""Terms and Conditions for DBS Altitude Credit Card New Cardmembers Sign-Up Promotion (“Promotion”)""I found it at the dbs altitude promotion pageBut when I go to the rewards tnc on dbs altitude card page  the PDF doesn't mention any exclusion for cardup",btohqsg
Let me know too. Most of them charge a huge spread or fees now. 🥴,btohqsg
yes  only signup promo exclude cardup,btohqsg
Because I don’t have SC smart CC and this DBS altitude earns miles for SimplyGo. 😄this is the only chance I can use this card… lol .. I need to keep this card to have 2 time of lounge access annually and get 10000 miles when paying annual fee if I have extra money to pay.. otherwise  I will request to waive it.,btohqsg
I see  that's good news thanks,btohqsg
Any advice on which cc to use for HK Disneyland tickets purchase from the official website? To minimize fx and foreign currency transactions feesCurrently have OCBC365  HSBC advance SC simply cash and SC spree cc,btohqsg
maybe Amaze+sc simply cash  based on the few cards u have,btohqsg
Maybe I shouldn’t have called it my strategy in my initial post cause that might make it sound too atas 😅 actually i should just call it  my plan. Hahawell  I just want to earn miles from anything I pay.. and recently I got my UOB prvimiles card and need to pay min 1000 sgd each month for first 2 months and pay annual fee to get the bonus miles. Mortgage is more than 1000 sgd so I don’t need to worry about not reaching min 1000 sgd per month to earn bonus miles. 😬,btohqsg
Use it when you book for plane and hotel,btohqsg
oh my uob mortgage loan has to be deducted from my uob account. how do i use the cardup method?,btohqsg
I would use DBS WWC for my hotel and flight booking online. 🤓🙏🏻,btohqsg
Hi All  planning to sign up for chiro..which card or payment method would you recommend?,btohqsg
https://milelion.com/2022/04/25/great-deal-enjoy-up-to-6-mpd-and-interest-free-instalments-on-the-dbs-womans-card/I just call dbs and was told 0% processing is no longer available,btohqsg
When you apply to pay mortgage on CardUp  u just set the amount to pay  choose the date to pay  key in your UOB bank account number where the monthly mortgage Is deducted and provide the mortgage documents from UOB as the proof requested on CardUp website when applying. Then the amount you set will be credited into your UOB account on the date you set. It’s very easy. 😉👍🏻I pay my maintenance fee and income taxes via CardUp too.,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone had any experience with both OCBC360 & UOB One?Im considering between a switch from OCBC (frustrated with the save portion & Giro Salary) to UOB but seen a couple of comments that UOB service is really bad  hence quite concernedBase on my situation  UOB does offer slightly higher rates,btohqsg
If u ask me i would say ocbc service is worst then uob  been a long time customer of uob liao,btohqsg
Personal View (it may varies between individuals):-a. OCBC - Branch - Always long queue filled with auntie and uncle  i went to open account and do some stuff and the queue is relatively reasonable. Their contact centre service - abit slow and their staff abit not well train. End Up i have to complain and talked to their managerb. UOB - the branch queue not as long compare to obcb  but that time when i went to open my account  it took me 5hours. (unless if you can open online  mine cause their system got issue  hence i got no choice but to go down.) their contact centre - relatively faster and their staff sound knowledgeable and confident. one call resolution.Overall  if u ask me  UOB may be a better choice as long as u dun need their branch services.* all these are my personal experience with them and it may diff between u and me.,btohqsg
Now they trying to push everyone to online  everytime i go to branch  they say “u have to wait xxxxx hours ahh  u go home do faster”,btohqsg
I'm using both with good experience so far,btohqsg
I used both before and currently i'm using OCBC 360 now. Rates wise yes UOB edges out slightly but the downside for me is that you need to use their specific credit cards. Whereas OCBC if you use their CC is just a bonus but if not you can use whatever you are comfortable with. I prefer that flexibility la.Customer service wise  i think they are quite on par. i had both good and bad experience on both sides. 😂,btohqsg
i’ve done the switch from ocbc to uob this year and i’d say the interaction with the staff is at a minimum. only thing i dun like abt uob is their support. i reported an contactless withdrawal atm issue 6 months ago and until today not fixed.,btohqsg
Can I ask what's frustrating/ bad about the ocbc 360?,btohqsg
one thing about ocbc360 is you need to increase $500 monthly even when exceeded $100k  and you need to find a chance to reset to $100k,btohqsg
Mainly the salary crediting have to be through giro (think they just implemented giro paynow)queue is insanely long so  it's a hassle to go to their branck (gotta wait more than hour)Their save segment  to increase avg daily balance by $500 each month  although had $500 inside and even topped up $200+  avg daily still below $500,btohqsg
I do agree with the service of OCBC 🥲,btohqsg
I went during weekday. Less people.Top up $600 on first day of every month will make our life easier.,btohqsg
Just asking if I spending monthly from $3000 -$4000  what cards will be the best ?Should I use Miles cards or rebates cards ?Currently I using UOB One cards to fulfill $2000 monthly (rebates) & amex platinum (points),btohqsg
Unfortunately weekday have work 😅 i topped up $550 exact  then add on later but it was still $300++ tho,btohqsg
Depends on what stuff you're spending on though,btohqsg
You top up on first day of the month or mid month?OCBC calculates base on average daily balance. If you top up in the middle of the month  likely you need to top up $1000.,btohqsg
Everything from Dining  Transport  Utilities  Online Grocery  Telco & Streaming,btohqsg
Start of month  left it in the account after pay is in,btohqsg
Can use uob solitaire for 2 categories other cat spends cn fulfil w citi rewards / hsbc revol / ppv,btohqsg
Should I consider using or Miles card or stay put at Rebates Cards since I spending 3K monthly on general stuff.,btohqsg
Depends if you're frequent miles chaser. If not then no point u get miles but don't use. Might as well get cashback,btohqsg
i think amex generally very bad rewards. so the balance 1-2k spending must see what your usual spending is on before can advise,btohqsg
i think i’m in the same situation as you. for me  i’m going to explore miles and just applied for the uob lady solitaire card. i’m thinking to explore traveling again hence the decision,btohqsg
Another question  if I decide to explore Miles option  do u think Amex metal card or UOB infinite Metal card to spend all amounts on it ? Overseas every year once,btohqsg
Which credit card should I use for insurance payment? All credit card have nerf insurance payment for minimum spending and also cashback/miles ?,btohqsg
For miles I think Kris flyer CC + amaze is the best for no cap spending. But you must be able to at least spend 800/ year on SIA / scoot.,btohqsg
Is it possible to use YouTrip with GxS?,btohqsg
Hi. Can anyone share?If i buy NTUC vouchers  does it counted as qualify spending for the cashback for dbs yuu credit card?If yes  can i buy through apps or counter better? Thanks in advance for the advice.🙏,btohqsg
Need to spend within the categories listed also hahah,btohqsg
Ntuc is not yuu merchant so no you won't get the 18% ...,btohqsg
Thanks.Paiseh i am referring to the $350 cashback promo.,btohqsg
At covers most of your major spend. Dining  online shopping  grab. Flight  hotel. Combo with amaze.But when u go overseas buy bag buy cosmetics buy alcohol can accumulate miles.Only exclusions you use your 2nd card.,btohqsg
Methoros or Andrew u refer to KrisFlyer CC  any preference from which bank ?,btohqsg
Only UOB have. The mastercard version.,btohqsg
Also got Amex Krisflyer card  but the posts are referring to the UOB one,btohqsg
Yupp uob kf 3mpd unlimited on categories listed. Need to spend 800 on sq products in a year. Only issue this card is 1.2 mpd award initially other 1.8 comes on 1 year plus later. And no option for other transfer partners all auto go into krisflyer acc,btohqsg
Yep downside mainly the minimum 800 / year SIA co. spend.and bonus points at card year end.,btohqsg
800/year on SIA spend - Can I purchase air tickets or scoot to offset that min $800 ?,btohqsg
Yes can sq or scoot tickets eligible.Note your extra 1.8 mpd only comes in 1 year later.,btohqsg
If you're a miles chaser.Best is still spend 500 ish on Uob one for bonus interest. Then remaining on another card.If not just stick to 2k on Uob One card works as well for the cash back.,btohqsg
If I purchase ticket $800/yearly for scoot or SQ  meaning I can spend on dining & get back 3 Qris mile for every $1 spend ?,btohqsg
When pay is in should transfer out all. Then 1st of every month u deposit at least $510. But remember to transfer out all the interest amount as well.,btohqsg
Yes.But not just dining. Online shopping and department stores too. Remember to combo with amaze card to make everything online spend.There are some exclusions.,btohqsg
Remember the possibility of you not willing to pay the credit card annual fee n all the 1.8 mpd bonus miles earned for last one year forfeited by banks.,btohqsg
I think you can just ask to waive the annual fee.,btohqsg
Combo with Amaze card - for rebates right ?,btohqsg
You can use the keyword “Card insurance” to search chat history related to this query.,btohqsg

UOB Lady card is for men too.,btohqsg
Any of the Lady card right ? Think the metal cards get the best benefit. Can choose 2 out of 6 rewards categories to get 15x Uni$,btohqsg
The metal one is invite-only and charges AF. Solitaire has the same benefits but must be earning > $120k,btohqsg
Hey guys  fave pay doesn’t give any miles for dbs credit cards right? (Woman’s World),btohqsg
You can use the keyword “Dbs fave” to search chat history related to this query.,btohqsg
Not sure what is the best way to educate people to use search function 😅,btohqsg
For starters  not using the word ‘educate’ would likely help the receiving party not feel patronised.My suggestion would be: “Good question  I’m not too sure what the answer is but you may try to search on the chat if someone else had the same concern. good luck!”,btohqsg

to withdraw money from youtrip in malaysia  i need to top up sgd into ny youtrip account then convert the sgd to ringgit first before being able to withdraw is it?,btohqsg
From my personal experience  it doesn’t matter if you converted it  youtrip will take from whichever of the 10 currencies has enough to fulfill the withdrawal.,btohqsg
YouTrip don't support MYR wallet. So it takes from SGD (and other currency wallets if not enough).,btohqsg
If you want a MYR balacne  use wise. Additionally for places that don’t accept Visa  you can link your wise card to TouchnGo wallet and pay with QR code with no fees,btohqsg
ohhhh thank you so much !!!!,btohqsg
Takes time  but I think it's ok to ask repeated as long as it's not brought up too often  especially given how rapid bank change policies these days,btohqsg
"YouTrip only have 11 currency wallets so you can ""lock in"" the rate by converting your currency to the desired currency. Take it like you went to money exchange go change money  but instead of cash  it's in a e-Wallet.For the remaining currencies  it would be on real-time exchange rate. Take it like you're swiping your debit card. But when you swipe your YouTrip card  remember to select local currency (not SGD) so that conversion is done by YouTrip.",btohqsg
Come back remember change local currency can liao.. got one time I paid simplygo with Thai baht without realizing (was Revolut promo for public transport) 😂,btohqsg

yes  if mcc is under whitelist for 10x points,btohqsg
Hello  new to this group. Sorry if its a noob question. Any idea what MCC is itunes store (apple music  subscriptions etc)? Does it qualify for online spend. I have the HSBc revolution card and citi rewards where rewards are connected to online spend.,btohqsg

Hi For UOB salary credit promo  if I credited before 30 Jun   am I not eligible?,btohqsg
Uob lady bonus point is based on catergory choose  doesnt matter how u pay,btohqsg
Hi  how it work and is reward good? Can use amex card top up and earn rebate?,btohqsg
Assume it’s normal useless vouchers or cents of rebate from gpay,btohqsg
Hi  not sure whether is this asked in the community. So the MooMoo promotion for 5.8% guaranteed is also applied for existing users?In addition  we just have to topup $10k to MooMoo and buy 5 times money market fund will do is it?,btohqsg
What about top up using uob amex got 1.7% rebate?,btohqsg
think gpay in this case is funded by bank account,btohqsg
Google search said it can use to top up.,btohqsg
google dun have account to be topped up ah,btohqsg
So it mean tag to your credit card for payment?,btohqsg
either credit card or dbs/ocbc/scb bank account. Think in this case it is the latter.,btohqsg
Then u can use Google pay to top up cpf to get reward and earn cash rebate 1.7% from uob amex?,btohqsg
dun think so  will be funded by bank account not CC,btohqsg
Morning all!!the lady card - Bonus point only come in next month right? I only received the base point.I spend 100 on HDL. i got 20 uni$,btohqsg
Yes I tink end of mth then calculate. Total spent then round down to nearest 5,btohqsg
They count at end of Calendar mth right bro? Then round down to nearest 5,btohqsg
arrr icic.. okay.. no wonder.. i spend 100. i get only 20.. which mean next month i will get 280,btohqsg

Guys  did you keep your munny in EGA account after 3months? What's the good strategy.. UOB?,btohqsg
Hello guys ~ can I check.. for UOB ladies card  fashion category covers online shopping platform like Lazada/ shoppe right?,btohqsg
This question honestly is quite dangerous to assume/answer because Lazada and Shopee has multiple MCCs and the final MCC you get is based on the merchant.To be safe this is what I do:1. Shopee = UOB One card = 10% cash rebate2. Lazada = Citi CRMC = 4mpd,btohqsg
If you can hit Citi CRMC max $1k every month  can consider Citi Lazada card too.,btohqsg
citi is such a pain... max of 5 cards per person,btohqsg
Seems like still Citi rewards card with amaze is the better option for me,btohqsg
correct... although for both shopee and lazada they are already online so technically don't need amaze layer but if you want to keep that for good practice  also ok,btohqsg
Is it stated that max allow is 5 cards? Anyone have dp that they have more than 5?,btohqsg
i got exceptional approval for a 6th card 1-2 years ago  but recently when I tried to apply for a 7th card  Citibank insisted I cancel 2 existing cards before they approved my new application.,btohqsg
Which card did u apply for tho,btohqsg
Hi  can i check if lady card want to earn rewards via amaze card should choose which category?,btohqsg
I have:Citi M1 VisaCiti Cashback VisaCiti Cashback MasterCiti Premier MilesCiti SMRTCiti Cashback+ Master (exceptionally approved 6th card)I tried to add Citi PrestigeWas not able to be approved until I cancelled Citi M1 Visa and Citi SMRT.After I cancelled these 2  they approved my Prestige and I'm back at the max of 5 cards with Citi.,btohqsg
Depend on which cat u spend more on. No one can answer gpr u. U need to know your own spending habit,btohqsg
Citi smrt is a very good card to spend online  it get back 5 percent cashback,btohqsg
Mostly on foods and electrical stuffs,btohqsg
He probably alr maxed the 5% for 600 cashback so cancelled it after hit the cap haha,btohqsg
yeah but it excludes travel spending which is one of the only reasons I would spend large amounts online for 5% (now UOB Lady has 6mpd  even lower reason).5% for online spending now loses to quite a number of 4mpd cards (depends on your miles valuation) so I didn't really see the shine of Citi SMRT anymore for sometime.,btohqsg
Hi anyone know if I will be eligible for 4mpd for payment on Atome using DBS Woman World card? 😊,btohqsg
Hi. If I apply new credit card every month  is it harder that my credit card will be approved?,btohqsg
Spend transactions on the Grab mobile application are cumulative and combined for the purpose of calculating whether the S$200 threshold per calendar month has been met. Transactions made on the Grab mobile applicationexcludetop-up charges for GrabPay (with effect from 1st March 2020).So how do we clock this ah... is it debiting directly from grab instead of grabpay?,btohqsg
hi  does anyone know whether the Amaze Card + UOB KrisFlyer Miles Combo still works for the uncapped 3mpd through the online transactions?,btohqsg
i see. so if the MCC of the transaction is not within the eligible MCCs  I won't be eligible for 3mpd even though the transaction is converted to online transaction by Amaze? I mean technically I would not be able to use the 'online' workaround for the UOB KrisFlyer?,btohqsg
hi  anyone happen to know when i can start buy t-bill this month?,btohqsg
hi all   promos aside  any thoughts on moomoo cash plus vs tiger vault?,btohqsg
It is the same. No difference if it is same fund,btohqsg
My 3months EGA is almost over but haven't received HSBC revolution. Applied on the same day.They wanted me to save money not spend it. Like my mom haha,btohqsg
Anyone knows difference between entering card details vs using Apple Pay on the online Apple Store for Hsbc revolution? Does both earn 4mpd? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
they are all online transactions right? no difference,btohqsg
Yeah I assume so. I got worried because using Citi rewards and just entering card details  I didn’t get 4mpd. Only pairing the crmc with Instarem does. Painful mistake 🥹 so I’m worried if there’s anything to look out for with hsbc revolution.,btohqsg
Hihi…for d UOB One Account  if don’t have salary credit how huh…?? Any other ways…?,btohqsg
strange.. it should have been eligible for 4mpd under crmc..,btohqsg
3x giro payments instead  but you won’t earn as high of a interest rate without Salary crediting.,btohqsg
Tried with two separate transactions  both times CRMC didn’t give me 4PMD by using it on the apple online store. Only when paired with amaze then I get 4mpd.,btohqsg
Are there any referral codes for opening a digibank with DBS?,btohqsg
doesnt seem to fall under the exclusion mentioned inhttps://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/Rewards_Exclusion_List.pdfdid u find out why?,btohqsg
Spent almost a month back and fourth with Citibank. It was not a pleasant experience. In the end their last response was:Upon review  the relevant have advised that the transaction on 17May2023 did not earn bonus points as it does not come in as an online transaction. This is information passed to Citi from the merchant’s acquirer and Citi has no control over it.I would like to inform you that we base the qualified reward earnings on the Merchant Category Code (MCC).I gave up after that.,btohqsg
oh gosh... should have asked what the MCC is :/ i'm sure it was an unpleasant experience,btohqsg
Yeah…lost a lot of valuable miles.. Hence now I have this fear with hsbc revolution.. hopefully I’ll get the bonus points on the apple online store.,btohqsg
i am worried myself now.. i'm just starting my miles journey and am planning to use both uob lady's and crmc to earn miles.. am thinking if i should change to revo...,btohqsg
I think UOB ladys solitaire is great because of the 3k cap. Sadly for me  MCC 5732 for electronics is not eligible for 6mpd  and that happens to be most of my spending. However I still think it’s a great card for everything else.I just recently applied for hsbc revo to supplement my crmc because crmc doesn’t give 4mpd for travel. I just like that it’s a no annual fee card and gives you 4mpd for contactless spend as well. All the best!,btohqsg
I think it’s alright  but not for me because I prefer Citi and HSBC’s earning block of $1  and their 3 and 5 year validity period for the miles. And it’s just easier for me to manage my current cards- UOB Ladys solitaire  CRMC  premier miles and hsbc revolution. I do find the $13 355 cap per membership year for OCBC TR pretty useful for large purchases.,btohqsg
Have a question: let’s say I have 70k krisflyer miles expiring soon  I don’t intent to travel but when I check on the redemption catalog I can’t redeem an iPad or mobile products to sell for cash. What do you all suggest to use the miles for?,btohqsg
For things closest to redeem and convert to cash or use,btohqsg
U can transfer from dbs to uob with salary as reference to qualify for salart,btohqsg
Convert to krispay point when there is promo and then use it to offset purchase at participating merchant,btohqsg
wow sounds like a good reason to always use Amaze with CRMC regardless whether the transaction is online or not then.,btohqsg
as long as you use Amaze + CRMC and not at travel related  you should be very safe,btohqsg
Thanks sounds like the only choice was thinking of doing that and purchase something from challenger 😂,btohqsg
If there is still time. I only convert during those promotion. Then u can use to redeem ntuc during miles back promo,btohqsg
U go to customer service counter tell them u like to redem ntuc voucher using krispay point,btohqsg
But do it during miles back promo to maximis the benefit,btohqsg
i just found out my citi rewards card is a visa card not mastercard 😳 does that affect my 4mpd earning?,btohqsg
Doesn’t affect but can’t pair with amaze,btohqsg
Oh so have to buy at the ntuc store itself right?,btohqsg
That’s the best method thanks for the info!,btohqsg
I thought it was closed n fully subscribed?,btohqsg
Is this covered under SDIC? Lol,btohqsg
i’m using heymax to check mcc for anytime fitness but they have 2 mcc. how do i know which is the correct one?,btohqsg
Can still apply through OCBC portal.,btohqsg
But seems like only if you have srs with ocbc then can  mines with dbs so cannot,btohqsg
No . Buy Fullerton fund better. Can take out anytime.,btohqsg
citi rewards excludes mobile online/in-app. E.g. Using citi rewards via googlepay/applepay on website/apps like Kris+  Xnap  apple etc.Workaround is using Amaze+crmc to route via Amaze so no longer mobile online/in-app,btohqsg
does hsbc revo be eligible? or also excluded?,btohqsg
hsbc revolution dun exclude mobile online/in-app  treat it as online and get 10x points so if mcc is on whitelist,btohqsg
Please advise which is the best platform to purchase from atm,btohqsg
Hi  Can we pair Kris+ with uob lady card ?Do we earn miles from it ?,btohqsg
yes  earn bonus points so long mcc under chosen category,btohqsg
hi  for uob one  if a transaction has been posted  will it appear here immediately? or if it doesnt appear here means it's not eligible?,btohqsg
take some time to be reflected,btohqsg

is there a list of all the MCCs that dbs altitude considers as Travel? specifically airbnb,btohqsg
Ok sure I’ll try thanks 😊,btohqsg
Up to !!  Also not guaranteed,btohqsg
Anyone tried booking agoda with DBS altitude ? Does it get the bonus 3 mpd ?,btohqsg
Not guaranteed. If you don't use his link to sign up  he will not get the money.,btohqsg
if your listed hotel is in expedia you might wanna use it to get 6mpd if i’m not wrong,btohqsg
go overseas withdraw or spend finish,btohqsg
When does DBS give you the bonus points? Any idea if it's after u paid the statement or year end or before 90 days,btohqsg
If a shop only allowed to pay via paynow or nets  is it the best we use any credit card to upload to grabpay. I get 1% cashback from habc giro when pay. Is it that the best way?,btohqsg
Malaysia so far I found is as long as they accept card can use youtrip leh. Which shop did you go that they don't allow?,btohqsg
Anyone use fwd travel insurance before?,btohqsg
Or recommend any travel insurance for my upcoming Japan trip for 10 days,btohqsg
what is the benefit of using Kris+ for FP finest?,btohqsg
none  only to use the kris pay points/ miles,btohqsg
Use b4. I buy the annual last time when I travel frequent.,btohqsg
So still ok? Happen to claim before ?,btohqsg
hi  i just received the DBA sms from hsbc for paying my citibank card  does this mean from now onwards it will be paid via giro? or do i have to wait for something on citi side,btohqsg
You have to confirm in your Citi statement that it will be paid via giro.,btohqsg
so essentially i will only know 1 month later? when my statement is out,btohqsg
Which is the best to tag with amaze for cash rebates ?,btohqsg
citi cashback  maybank family and friends,btohqsg
If for local spend  no additional benefits for tagging to Amaze,btohqsg
Imo  dun bother w grabpay ever.... Just use cash/nets/paynow and get over it ....Or go to another shop that accepts the ideal mode of payment u want....,btohqsg
I’m doing it cos I have miles expiring and not planning to go for a trip,btohqsg
Hahaha i have some balance left whereby cannot transfer back to bank so wanna clear the balance there,btohqsg
Can top up to the exact amt u wanted to use and buy the product?,btohqsg
for setting up GIRO paid by HSBC EGA for various stuff like Tax (IRAS)  credit cards from a bunch of different banks I have to fill up the forms with signature to the respective bill source?i.e. fill up DBS interbank GIRO form (with HSBC EGA as the debiting account) for DBS credit cards and mail it to DBS?That sounds SO TEDIOUS,btohqsg
Was thinking us whatever card to topup and earn the 1% cashback but just think if there is any better alternative,btohqsg
That's why already mentioned. People who are afraid of hassle should stay far far away from hsbc,btohqsg
Imo  dun count the small pennies  just top up  buy any low value product and get rid of grabpay ..Spend the time n energy on other more productive stuff....,btohqsg
You can also try to book through this linkhttps://www.agoda.com/en-gb/dbsSometimes it's cheaper than booking directly through agoda app or agoda via other third party search engines like TripAdvisor or Google Hotels,btohqsg
Can we set minimum amount $1 from Uob app for credit card transaction?,btohqsg
Just tried. Cannot add UOB Absolute card to Google pay to pay online  but Paypal can. Any cashback from Paypal?,btohqsg

Sometimes u can use this platform to withdraw your excess grabpay funds.,btohqsg

Hi guys   can crmc earn 4mpd on grab transport?,btohqsg
Anyone knows how they classify taobao/shopee mcc? If I have a mix of clothing and furniture what MCC will they use?,btohqsg
Suggest to split it into different payments. If you combined it into one payment  only one of the mcc codes in the purchase list will be used to represent the mcc code for all your purchased.,btohqsg
If that's the case  UOB ladys solitaire is pretty useless for me 😅 Most of the big purchases coming up are furnitures and electronics. Thank you!,btohqsg
What cc do you guys use for furniture purchases on Taobao? Amount more than $1k,btohqsg
that’s why i’m applying for hsbc revol now… citi rewards too confusing,btohqsg
Hi all  for the UOB one account  to fulfill the spending requirement of $500  is it okay if I spend $250 on the Lady's card and $250 on the EVOL card to make it $500?,btohqsg
EVOL needs min $600 to get cashback,btohqsg
I’m just talking about fulfilling the UOB one account criteria,btohqsg
should I use UOB  Lady’s card (family category chosen) in MUSTAFA  to get 6 miles which is better than OCBC Titanium since its MCC 5441 is grocery and supermarket?UOB only lists out NTUC  Sheng Siong  Giant and Cold Storage…. So I like to reconfirm for MUSTAFA.Thanks guys! 😁🙏🏻,btohqsg
Apologies. Pls ignore previous comment. Mustafa can use UOB lady. MCC 5411 under Family Category to earn 6MPD,btohqsg
You can use HeyMax to check,btohqsg
Thank you for the clarifying on this. 😁🙏🏻 your help is greatly appreciated.,btohqsg
Hi anyone tried to buy yoga movement classes with UOB PPV before? Will I get UNI$?,btohqsg
U can get all 3  amex  visa  mastercard,btohqsg
I think the problem with mustafa is that their terminal have different mcc. Like only their supermarket is 5411 and those that sell electonics is other mcc. Platform like amazon may have segregate their amazon fresh from other amazon sales etc.,btohqsg
Oh I see 😮. Thank you for the reminder. 😄🙏🏻 good to take note of it. 👍🏻,btohqsg
ocbc tr dont include furnitures though,btohqsg
Court  ikea  taobao also get bonus miles for ocbc tr,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone knows if prepaid income tax will be refunded by iras? Considering to prepay income tax using Citi-Payall before end Aug to utilize the 1% HSBC everyday+ giro promo,btohqsg
yes.. but they will take a long time to refund.. most likely  it'll just be used to pay the following years income tax.I just recently got a refund of property tax from IRAS from my dad's estate. My dad passed away in 2016.. it took IRAS 7 years to issue a check refund  after his estate has already been long distributed out.. That's how long IRAS took for us.. but yes  they ultimately do refund.,btohqsg
Thanks. Good to know. Seems like the odds of HSBC extending their everyday+ beyond Aug is low. 😭,btohqsg
If u overpay income tax without approval u will get auto cheque refund. If u do it too much u will get iras warning letter.,btohqsg
Hi Does anyone know if applying for credit limit increase will create a hard pull on my credit ? I scared to hurt my score lol,btohqsg
Nowadays  anything online like shopee  lazada cashback I use DBS WWCC... so no headache to face,btohqsg

Is this for HDB loan only?,btohqsg
Can bring electronic item to supermarket cashier?,btohqsg
U need to ask mustafa for this not here,btohqsg
Is SRS tagged to one bank only?,btohqsg
Oh@kelvintaninvestnew Tele group  so become competitor now ah? Haha 😆,btohqsg
Am still thinking where to park my srs money,btohqsg
Yes it will do a pull on your credit. Will appear on ur credit report.,btohqsg
Anyone knows which card gets rewards for atome,btohqsg
Hi  for CRMC  it shows 10x point for any online retail merchants. Does buying movie tics online consider retail merchants?,btohqsg
Hi all I have got some spare cash  may I know where i can get the highest interest rates?,btohqsg
Ty! So as long it’s online  even mcd delivery counts?,btohqsg
online spend cards and depends on what your merchant is,btohqsg
so long online and MCC not excluded as per the card's TnC,btohqsg
How does UOB lady work? So each transaction must be $5 to qualify for the 6mpd? Or do they look collectively at the whole bill statement? I.e $99.99 you will only get the 6mpd based on $95 instead of $100,btohqsg
Does DBS Amex still have compliment travel insurance when book flight ticket with it ?,btohqsg
0.4mpd (1x point) based on $5 blocks per transaction3.6mpd (9x bonus points) = round down to nearest whole ((sum of eligible spending in calendar month)/5×9)2mpd (5x bonus points) = round down to nearest whole ((sum of eligible spending in calendar month)/5×5),btohqsg
So essentially if I opt for transport category and assuming I only spend about $3 on SimplyGo daily. It will not be optimal to utilise this,btohqsg
I just tried to register now and it failed too. Have you solved your problem? 😣😣,btohqsg
For HSBC T1 lounge pass registration.. it failed. Anyone has same problem?,btohqsg
Mastercard simplygo transactions consolidate (5 days or $15 whichever earlier) before posting and 5.6mpd is based on sum in calendar month. So should still get close to 5.6mpd to 6mpd.,btohqsg
does ntuc fairprice transaction in store (paid by apple pay) allow me 10x point in both crmc and revo? if not  how about paying in store thru the Fairprice app?,btohqsg

Random lunch time chat lol  important knowledge,btohqsg
We need Chris to do a video test on this,btohqsg
Actually I got my card last month and realised today that I need to register online myself. Unfortunately  it failed. I called HSBC and they will get back to me with updates later.,btohqsg
Just follow the steps here on DBS or heymaxhttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
Baik  I shall report the MCC for Onlyfans when I find it,btohqsg
Hi experts  may I consult you if after I’ve made a transaction (e.g. $3000 on my DBS WWMC)  if I then decide to pay off this transaction via instalment via DBS over 3 months  will my bonus spending limit also be split across the 3 months?,btohqsg
If I want to buy phone bill (giga or gomo)  can I link to HSBC or DBS WWMC to earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Is it a good decision to use the amaze and citi rewards credit card combo while shopping in Malaysia? Will the benefits outweigh the fx spread?,btohqsg
Ok so according to heymax  Onlyfans is classified under 8999 professional services-not elsewhere classified  I don't see any kind of exclusion on dbs tnc  so I think I'm taking my $100 lunch bet,btohqsg
Not sure about HSBC  but dbs specifically exclude bill payments  you can probably try routing thru cardup to earn some miles thou,btohqsg
i’ve asked the group before. looks like crmc will be eligible. tho not any of those cards,btohqsg
According to heymax DBS also has 4mpd,btohqsg
If linked amaze also okay right,btohqsg
yes but need to make sure the right card is linked to Amaze at the point of recurrent payment each month,btohqsg
so m1 and giga bill can pay using crmc without amaze to earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
uh u were saying apparently no need link crmc to Amaze  now u asking?,btohqsg
i got confused because of this.. 😔,btohqsg
When are you Able to WITHDRAW your CPF?https://youtu.be/sfgD53ODUd0,btohqsg
Okok  no worries! See you guys offline then 😂,btohqsg
Personal income tax different. They refund almost immediately. At least in my case within the same month.,btohqsg
If it those input credit card and pay via app should be okayCause I do that via StarHub app,btohqsg
Are you able to use your CPF money to buy SG fullerton fund?,btohqsg
What’s the best credit card to top up to YouTrip card?,btohqsg
If SA giving 4% interest.Why people and property agent advice to use some CASH to pay mortgage loan to lower the accrued interest?Should have just keep topping up SA until max 1st and dun use CASH to pay for mortgage since interest rate for HDB LOAN is 2.6%.,btohqsg
bcos many ppl dunno what is accrued interest.,btohqsg
So by right shouldn't pay housing loan as soon as possible?Should just pay the minimum requirement. Max loan from CPF and then top up excess OA funds to SA.,btohqsg
that's what i ask my wife to do (i would do this too if my SA has not reach FRS). but it really depends on ur situation  since anything u put into SA is not reversible. we are okay to do that bcos our job is stable  and even if anything happens to our job  we have enough savings to tile over the mortgage loan  so we are comfortable to drag out the loan and put our money in SA.,btohqsg
Different people different opportunity cost. If a house owner can use his cash on hands to invest in business  investment or trading that have 10% return per year  he/shall use CPF OA to pay mortgage loan. If a person opportunity cost is lower than 2.6%  then shall not use CPF OA to pay the mortgage.,btohqsg
you can clear use cash to clear OA used and then trf the funds to SA to fill up till FRS. It will work that way too,btohqsg
Hi guys  any fresh grad (or anyone) who is existing UOB card holder for 3 month+ with ~80K annual income able to apply for the UOB Lady’s Solitaire card? I tried applying via SMS thinking there’s a higher success rate  but received my rejection SMS after 12 days. Need some lifehacks without 30k collateral.,btohqsg

UOB Lady's can use with XNAP? Is it eligible for 6mpd?,btohqsg
Heard theyre pretty strict for this,btohqsg
Don't think have any hacks for this. Just apply and see if yes or no. Some ppl lower than 100k get accepted some abv 100k also rejected so don't know whats their criteria.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if Citi plus promo on singsaver is applicable for someone who has cancelled Citi credit card in the last 12-13 months,btohqsg
The question is you only work for 3 months after graduate n how they assess you have $80k of annual income. Banks usually use income tax assessments as a source to verify your income via MyInfo.,btohqsg
Actually I worked 1.5 yrs but previous year salary excluding bonus I only bag 80k. Was late into credit card game and only held onto a UOB card for 3 months,btohqsg
Since you only held uob credit card for 3 months  I guess your previous submission of income info is before this year income tax assessment period which starts around Apr 2023. So there is only two possibilities:1). UOB likely don’t have your income tax info.2). UOB strictly follow the rules on your application ie $120k.,btohqsg

Anyone currently using UOB Ladies Signature Card and got upgraded to the metal card?,btohqsg
Doesn’t the UOB absolute cash back gives more?1.7%,btohqsg
Apply it through mobile app approved within a day. Card (solitaire) was in the system the next,btohqsg
I only have TCB. Don't feel the need to have another card for 0.2% more.,btohqsg
Got it. Actually  a better one is SCB Spree Card at 2% but not sure if such parking fees are qualifying spend or not.,btohqsg
Oo thanks for highlighting  I guess when I first started using theparking.sgapp maybe Amex wasn't an option for payment  tts y I used HSBC Advance for the cb  now I just changed to UOB absolute,btohqsg
For grab top up... really more of getting some form of cb  little nevermind  coz what's e point of leaving cash on e table..I would take $0.30 / on e table if I see it untouchedMy purpose of grab is mainly to pay for LTA stuff thru their website (not AXS) as they can still accept Grab card for payment,btohqsg

Suggestion:Personally I took accident plan in AIA and later switched to Prudential since I'm working in IT and not a sports person if I remember correctly I claimed twice. Now my company has out patient benefit so I have cancelled. So it really depends on you to decide whether it is necessary and if you are taking it's better to take with the insurance company which approves claim fast and my suggestion would be AIA or Prudential,btohqsg
You should see the funds back in the srs by day end of 11 Jul.,btohqsg
Have the same qns. Has it been addressed/answered?,btohqsg
Depends on when u started. Mine is in the positive.,btohqsg

To get sufficient coverage for your personal medical and hospitalization (shield) insurance is the MOST important and start when you are still young.  Medisave and company insurance is not sufficient. Better you get advice from an *independent* financial adviser  who can advise different insurance policies from different companies that suits your income level etc. It is to ensure that you can afford to pay the premium. My personal experience with Prudential so far is great  fast in processing claim.,btohqsg
Guess now old already too late,btohqsg
No harm to still get advice and find out the premium cost for you. If you can afford than why not. There may be exclusion of coverage or pay higher premium for certain existing condition to be covered.,btohqsg
Wondering if claim can stack company & personal hospitalized claim or only can submit one,btohqsg
Esp now cancer rate is high,btohqsg
The key reason to get medishield is that should you get so sick that you cannot work anymore  by that time  no insurance company will accept you and you will be hung dry without insurance.,btohqsg
Most group company insurance won't cover you full. There is amount limit  exclusions etc. The remaining amount  you can claim to your personal shield insurance  of course  also subject to your policy term.,btohqsg
So I can stack Medisave & co hospital insurance,btohqsg
In fact  if your personal insurance is the highest tier  it includes rider to cover own cash co-pay and Medisave  as such you won't need to pay anything. Although it may impact your next year's premium rate (i.e.  increase in premium) depending  again  your policy term.,btohqsg
Usually you can claim from company insurance -> personal insurance -> if any Co-payment using medisave -> if any Co-payment using cash,btohqsg
Ya recently I pay with co insurance & Medisave,btohqsg
"Recently  there is a change in the cancer medication coverage policy related to shield insurance and Medisave  i.e.  medication not listed in the table  will not be covered. So if you want to be 100% covered  then you may need to buy ""critical illness"" insurance policy..",btohqsg
