i did signal & check blind spot to make sure got no car. i didnâ€™t see him at all previously on my rear view mirror,btohqsg
Post fb threaten with police report,btohqsg
oh sad to say in this case very difficult,btohqsg
Anyone running from scene = in fault already,btohqsg
but true if he nvr stop maybe he was drink driving ot smth,btohqsg
moreover i was renting from getgo & this happen. the insurance people came down to write down some stuff regarding the whole situation,btohqsg
Based on your video and the fact u rent from getgo,btohqsg
And just quietly get it repaired,btohqsg
Because if getgo does the repair,btohqsg
The excess to you is going to be ridiculous,btohqsg
I think he dw to repair bah since not his fault,btohqsg
And the claim is not going to be 100% win,btohqsg
bobian now just wait & see what getgo email me uh,btohqsg
Well u have the plate details and all,btohqsg
99% chance he will pay full,btohqsg
And about 4-10x market rate for repair,btohqsg
Or simply donâ€™t pay and account get suspended,btohqsg
There is a 1% chance can get back 30% of claim in about 5-6 years time,btohqsg
thats why not fair in sg,btohqsg
Since its his rear fender versus your front and his front dashcam will show u changing 2 lanes,btohqsg
i donâ€™t think bmw will report cos he himself hit & run,btohqsg
last time simple hit frm the back the insurance told me nothing can be done if the guy at the back does not report,btohqsg
U shouldnt have report either in this scenario,btohqsg
Side to side impact the big winner will be insurance because 2 policies become no ncd,btohqsg
