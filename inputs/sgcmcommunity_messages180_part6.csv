Hi guys  what are your thoughts on throttle controllers.Is it the real deal  or some gimmick and Iâ€™m better off relying on the manufacturerâ€™s normal/sports mode ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Usually when tht happen  i offline go coffeeshop drink coffee,btohqsg
works  not more power  just more sensitive throttle mapping,btohqsg
they can make a huge difference to how responsive the car feels. there is no added power. But it will feel very different and IMO worth it. For some cars its not so necessary because they have nice aggressive throttle maps from the factory (porsche for eg) but for other brands like lexus its almost a must to have them because the factory mapping is very sluggish and sport modes dont do much,btohqsg
They have their own clienteles and assigned jobs,btohqsg
