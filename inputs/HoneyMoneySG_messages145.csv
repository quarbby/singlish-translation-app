Best if u can find the exact video. I don't think that was what Chris said.,btohqsg
I digging through.. So many liao i thought someone here will remember something,btohqsg
What is the next best thing i can do now that they say i max out cannot top up anymore?,btohqsg
I went through some of his recent cpf videos cuz its time to top up. Didnt recall he said something like that.For tax reduction purposes  after max your own contribution  top up ur love one’s cpf or srs.,btohqsg
Never once mentioned that you can RSTU after hitting FRS on SA.,btohqsg
Maybe it about after Medisave deduction then you top up or 1 Jan top up for Medisave.,btohqsg
This happeens to MA  not SA,btohqsg
I think so liao. Mixed up. Thanks.,btohqsg
Will address new BHS and related actions in today's video on CPF,btohqsg
My medisave also maxed out. So troublesome after maxing out.,btohqsg
MA u have two windows to top up1. When BHS is adjusted every year.2.When there is outflow from yr MA like premium for medishield life  care shield life etc...do a check on yr 2024 transaction history u will see when those are deducted and top up in between this and the next monthly CPF contribution from yr employment.,btohqsg
For SA  once reached FRS  thats it. U can top up for loved ones if eligible,btohqsg
For my case for 2025  4k to match new BHS. 1.5k throughout the year for various premium deduction,btohqsg
No love one to top up but I might do screening or CSL supplement but not confirm yet,btohqsg
any mvno that offers phone contract / phone bundled with sim only?looking for something that will be cheaper than the SH  M1 and Singtel phone contract 2 years plan,btohqsg
I think circle life has but not much cheaper if i recall.Why dont u buy the phone outright and use cheaper plan from mvno. Its cheaper than 2 year plan.,btohqsg
company paying for it based on monthly bill* within a certain amount,btohqsg
Does ur company have a limit for monthly bill? Else  just whack major telcos,btohqsg
Yes for sure just $75  Major telco too expensive  high upfront too,btohqsg
i saw that gomo offers $xx plan and can buy phone on instalment from singtel but not sure how it works,btohqsg
hi does anyone know if i use citi rewards + amaze for paying dental is it 4mpd?,btohqsg
Yes if MCC 8021. Check merchant onhmsg.link/heymax,btohqsg
there is but its singtel installment plan in the bill,btohqsg
that means gomo bill will have 2 section? 1 for sim plan   one for phone installment?Just wondering more on the offer that singtel have   i think got $xxx off device when signing up for the phone installement,btohqsg
your gomo will have gomo bill,btohqsg
the device will charge to your singtel bill,btohqsg
what will happen if i get the device already and cancel my gomo sim/ transfer out? they got any clause on this?,btohqsg
not sure about this but it looks like its a pure device sales for them .. from how it was linked out from gomo website to singtel shop,btohqsg
can can thanks   if anyone is currently using gomo and the phone instalment from singtel do let  me know,btohqsg
HSBC sent out email. Claims to only implement the enhanced fraud (read: inconvenient blocking) from 16th June 2025 onwards.,btohqsg

Thx. I have below card  DBS yuu  UOB AB  UOB ONE  SC simply cash  SC SMART  Citi cashback+  HSBC REVOLUTION  HSBC ADVANCE. Do we know which card will have any rewards?,btohqsg
healthhub is mcc 8099  have reward on all the cards except cannot pay using Amex. Uob one  hsbc advance  citi cashback+ and sc simplygo have higher rewards out of the list. Can consider get other cards that give higher reward for online spend.,btohqsg
How about park at chocolate finance?,btohqsg
After the CPF Medisave top up of $400/500 in Dec. The current balance of MA for those who hit BHS already should $72K.Does it mean we can only top up $3.5K? Or will the whole amount go back to $71.5K after the interest is credit and transfer to OA/SA?,btohqsg
I decided to use scb esaver for the few days of parking.,btohqsg
If your MA already hit BHS by Dec  interest earned will go to SA or OA if SA has hit FRS.,btohqsg
can check if this offer is the same as the TnC in the Singsaver Christmas event? Seems like only need to spend $500 within 30 days of card approval  in comparison to the one stated here,btohqsg
Don't see a difference.. Chris' link lead to Singsavers' website which says $500 as well.https://hmsg.link/singsaverhsbc,btohqsg
I see  was looking at the eligibility part via the telegram message stating need to spend $600 for 3 months to qualify,btohqsg
To qualify for HSBC Live+ cashback.,btohqsg

Hi guys  want to check for Endowus  since both Amundi and BlackRock IE replicates S&P 500  and theoretically IE has lower annual cost. how come when i see annualised 1 year returns  Amundi is higher than IE?,btohqsg
Amundi says 33.41% and IE says 32.46%,btohqsg
hi all  i have a question that sounds silly but i'd like to confirm. say we're collecting miles — coming from diff credit cards diff banks. if we redeem to krisflyer  all the miles add up  is that correct?,btohqsg
Hi all  may I ask are payments for medical checkups are typically under eligible transactions for singsaver?,btohqsg
Best to check MCC and tally against t&c.,btohqsg
UserSamuelhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no shopee links,btohqsg
also  i think there's quite a few combinations and probably asked too many times but..if im paying for a tour  chan brothers  what would be the best way to accumulate miles (still not sure if i'd like to go down this path but been using CRMC + Amaze)? the full price is around 17k. my mom wants the free luggage. she has UOB Lady's  me too. we'd have to pay separately 5.8k per card to get the luggage. not sure if this is worth compared to miles as we're forfeiting 4.8k each because the cap for UOB Lady's is 1k a month?===some context:i spend less than 500 on card so i think it might be tough for those min spend cards  though 500 maybe still possible.. but im thinking in the long run as this payment for the trip is pretty much a one offthe only useful card i have is:UOB Lady's  the preferred category i default it for travelis there any promotion that i can grab (i think this i can take a look at singsaver/moneysmart)? what cards would y'all recommend? the cards i'll probably only use for travel in the future,btohqsg
Citi crmc exclude travel transaction for bonus point.,btohqsg
yup queenie! im aware of that  thanks!,btohqsg
UOB KF with Kris+ is best I think. 17k x (3mpd and 1mpd). 68k KF miles is better than luggage imo.,btohqsg
i see! crap i forgot theres the timerhonestly  i think i'd end up taking economy at the rate im going HAHA. plus if i were to soak up the miles  i think ill need to compensate my mom too  only fair to herwill take a look at UOB KF and Kris+! thanks Anthony!are there any other combi though?,btohqsg
Just apply for ntb and get a luggage for her haha,btohqsg
sorry whats ntb? she has many luggages already HAHA. but i have to compensate her in some wayalso im paying directly to the agency  so i suppose thats contactless. have to check whether the points/benefits will work etcis there any other bank i can grab promotions for?i have these below:CRMCSC SmartUOB Lady'sDBS Live Fresh from when i was a studentOCBC InfinityTrust Cashback,btohqsg
New to bank.68k KF miles can get her a business flight to many places. Best compensation hehe.Btw  at 17k amount  it bursts almost all 4mpd cards.,btohqsg
oh! unfortunately both of us have UOB lady's.. that biz class flight sounds awesome!i still have to ask  what if we're able to split up the payments  to probably sign up for other cards for sign up promo (typical i know :'))  or just UOB KF done deal?,btohqsg
HSBC signup gives luggage I think.I got one offer for amex Kris flyer but it seems targeted.,btohqsg
OH YES! hsbc live+ i think.. but just thought of this — problem is if we split  kinda tough to hit the miles to convert to KF miles too,btohqsg
Personally with chan bro  staff advice there might be issue if refund need to be initiate for krispay.So unless u are hitting challenge for krispay. I prefer to spilt payment on uob trio. Ppv/vs/lady. And u get delay payment until the deadline anyway.In theory if spilt on uob ladyx2/ppv/vs u can finish the payment in 3 months. Just need to go down 3 time that all,btohqsg
> staff advice there might be issue if refund need to be initiate for krispaydamn.. ahhh hmmm> And u get delay payment until the deadline anywayyes heard from my mom this too!thanks for this queenie!,btohqsg
Isn’t UOB PRVI only at 1.4MPD?,btohqsg
Thanks! Let me go research that!,btohqsg
I not keen in uob chan bro luggage not that great anyway haha. 68k miles is nicer to me,btohqsg
i remember reading on the miles valuation before but is there an average price? i'd like to compensate my momso anthony's saying UOB KF w Kris+ / krispayqueenie you're saying Ppv/vs/lady,btohqsg
> uob ladyx2/ppv/vs u can finish the payment in 3 monthsqueenie  you said split? do you mean like an instalment? i thought we'd have to pay in 2 sessions — first to book and pay deposit  next is collected nearing the departure date? not sure on this either,btohqsg
Just offer alternatives. Both should work but with the caveat of UOB KF + Kris+ as Queenie mentions.I suggested based on available information but it cannot beat personal experience from Queenie.,btohqsg
yup gotcha! thank you both. yeah just asking as you guys are the most experienced and i will go read up on them!,btohqsg
I can’t find online about getting 3 MPD for Malaysia usage. Can you share more on this pls.,btohqsg
UOB website. Ignore the last 2 column as its fcy promo.,btohqsg
Upgrade your Lady card to Solitaire and open Lady saving account.First month: pay $2k to earn 20 000 miles if you have $100k saving.2nd month to 9th month : pay $2k monthly till settle with $10k Lady saving to earn 6mpd every month.Total miles earned: 20 000 miles + 6mpd x $15k= 110 000 miles.,btohqsg
hey thanks for this MH! unfortunately i dont qualify for that 120k AI haha,btohqsg
hey guys dont mind if i just shoot some questions here. but if anyone is willing for me to pm  i'd appreciate it! so as not to spam this groupi have read the bank's site on the card  the full t&cs (not in depth just the important ones) and milelion's blog postfor UOBKF  is it me or i cant find that chan bro is under any of the category? im quite confused. i see there's multiple ways to get KF miles. not too sure how the miles are earned3 mpd on SIA Group  Kris+  dining  food delivery  online shopping  online travel  transport: is chan bro under like online shopping or something? i see online travel is those like agoda  tripdotcom  etc.oh and anthony may i ask how you got 3mpd + 1mpd?thank you,btohqsg
right.. pay via krispay? may i ask if i can link any card to this? i mean defo UOBKF! oopsanother related question  i saw this:> Each new Kris+ user must successfully make a minimum payment ofSingapore Five Dollars (S$5) via Apple Pay or Google PayTM via the paymentfunction in the Kris+ app at any Kris+ partner with Kris+ payment enabled  orby purchasing a Kris+ in-app voucher.i suppose i can use any card to meet this requirement? didnt really see if it has to be mastercard or visa or UOBKF,btohqsg
Can be any card that can be added to apple pay/google pay but uob kf is the only one uncapped 3mpd.And you earn additional 1kf mile per dollar on chan brothers.,btohqsg
thanks anthony! ah... so if i were to say split payment e.g.  we've 2 UOB lady's — 1k each  add them to gpay/apple pay  bust the limits. add UOBKF and pay for the remaining with it. this works?,btohqsg
Yes. Assume chan bros allows u to do that.,btohqsg
Hold on. Is chan bros on kris+ still travel for uob lady? I recall some travel agency via kris+ not in travel mcc for uob lady.,btohqsg
now i understand why you said just use UOBKF.. since it's at 4mpd overall. are the KF miles immediately credited? even after reading im still lost 🥲ill have to check whether chan bros allows to splitqueenie  ill still look at your combi HAHA,btohqsg
if that's the case  i think best to just do UOBKF. else  it's queenie's approach,btohqsg
For uob kf & kris+ combo  the 1mpd will be under kris pay miles and can be transferred immediately to KF acct. then you will get 3mpd next month in ur KF acct (ard 4-6th of the month),btohqsg
bless you anthony  thank you! always so helpful.. thanks thanks!!,btohqsg
yes! i searchedchanand saw that too. thanks MH!,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/172748this thread is quite insightful!actually i just realised something. i wont be able to split up the payments .. as this decision is rather last minute. the departure date is 24 jan next yeari suppose the best way to do this is UOB KF...? so 3mpd since paying via kris+ wouldnt work due to the mcc,btohqsg
It works. The 3mpd will be awarded based on Kris+ for uob kf but not awarded based on mcc.,btohqsg
i see! but there's still the extra 1mpd? also from what anthony mentioned above from the UOBKF + Kris+ comboMH you also said this HAHAMy understanding is:1).Avoidusing UOB Krisflyer2).Don’tpay via Kris+ pay.,btohqsg
also i would like to clarify for UOB lady's the points  or just in general (say for CRMC too) as i do track the transactions. i understand it's capped @ $1k spent a month. if i've already spent  say 100  on a non selected category  i still qualify for the full 1k spent a month? i.e.  bonus 3.6mpd   since it's 4mpd and the base is 0.4mpd,btohqsg
Avoid using UOB KF to pay directly.I thought shall pay using Kris+ with uob kf?,btohqsg
1) avoid paying with uob kf directly2) dont use uob lady travel via kris+ at chan bros,btohqsg
yup  got it! will do that!thank you both  i understand. just want to be sure,btohqsg
could i confirm another thing — hypothetically  how should i pay if chan bros asks to make payment online? i.e.  via our own devices. how can i pay with Kris+ then? else if it's at their office  may i ask how does that work?and to confirm  i checked but it doesnt really state explicitly. theres no min spend with UOBKF?,btohqsg
Hi all  understand that HealthHub codes as online transactions.Can anybody confirm that Citi rewards gives 4 miles per dollar for such transactions (max spend $1K monthly) ? Thanks.,btohqsg
Hi im new to miles game  does crmc + amaze still gets 4mpd for shopee?,btohqsg
im actually rethinking this... for UOBKF the min spend of 800 under SIA  i dont think i'd hit that honestly. but does it affect the 3mpd? though mentioned that 3mpd is credit next month into KF accountalso  for annual fee  do you guys pay for it? if waiver is declined  because of bonus miles being held back,btohqsg
paying via kris+ does not need to spend 800 on SIA group. 3mpd will get credited next month  not delayed like some categories.,btohqsg
ill go for UOBKF for now then as have to make payment later. thank you so much anthony  MH and queenie!,btohqsg
Apologies in advance that i may tag the wrong person  is it@qqplaceswho mentioned citibank will deduct full amount as per statement even if paid in advance  how about if its just annual fee  if it's waived will the giro trigger?@mttelegrammti have SCB annual fees which is waived one week after statement date  will giro still trigger for this annual fee? By right won't but SCB also works in weird ways,btohqsg
Citibank af waiver will still trigger giro based on my experiencr,btohqsg
This is special for citibank  and maybe SCB too? Thanks,btohqsg
I only know citibank so scb u need to ask other,btohqsg
Won’t trigger giro if waived at least 10 days before due date.,btohqsg
Does Citi rewards also earn 4 miles per dollar while we use kris + app?,btohqsg
May i check if i buy electronics like phones through shopee and lazada  does it qualify under uob lady card fashion?,btohqsg
what about amaze instraem on kris +?,btohqsg
amaze+citi rewards does earn 10x points on kris+ provided the MCC is not excluded,btohqsg
For BOC smartsaver  If I pay 3x $30 to one of my bank credit card  can I still get the 0.9% bonus interest?,btohqsg
thanks. i use it for paying petrol (ESSO),btohqsg
just a question  if my giro application to credit card bill payable is approved. does it mean i dont need to do any action then for my next credit card payment will automatic deduct from my designed account?,btohqsg
Yes but make sure ur statement said it will be paid by giro,btohqsg
ya. i will notice it when i receive my next statement.,btohqsg
but just a quick check for other bank giro setting. is it take around 2-3 weeks to complete? cos i recently set my uob  citibank  ocbc giro application at same time to my uob bank account and just uob and citibank is completed.,btohqsg
hi all  i just applied for UOB KF. is it ever possible that the application will be accepted within a few hours? i already have UOB lady's  i thought it'd be immediate 🫠edit: nvm it just got approved 3 mins later!will there be a digital card though?,btohqsg
Why to UOB instead of HSBC EGA? 😅,btohqsg
cos i havent open account with hsbc. 😂,btohqsg
Your current statement needs to be manually paid as long as it does not indicate GIRO payment.,btohqsg
Time to do it physically now! 🤣🤣,btohqsg

hey guys  for UOBKF  i still have some questions1. i own UOB lady's. do i qualify for the 5k bonus KF miles underWelcome Miles for first-time applicantsin their t&cs?2. for the 800 min spend on SIA-relatedHowever  the caveat is that the 3 mpd on everyday spend is only eligible if you spend a minimum of S$800 on the SIA-related categories annually  the SIA related are only these -- 'Singapore Airlines  Scoot  KrisShop  Kris+ purchases'? for Kris+ purchases  it's basically just entering the merchant name and paying with the QR code via google pay / apple pay?for #2  if i hit the 800 annual min spend  i get 3mpd on the other categories e.g.  online shopping  online travel txns i.e.  using UOBKF directly to pay in tripdotcom/agoda/etc  dining  etc?,btohqsg
The $800 min spend does not include Kris+,btohqsg
Hello does anyone know if UOB Lady Solitaire card 2nd year onwards able to waive fees?,btohqsg
Yes but depend on individual spending profile,btohqsg
Ok thanks! and does anyone know if Citi Prestige card is worth renewing for ($545 for 25k miles)? I signed up last year cause the sign up bonus was pretty good.I’m someone who travels quite often  almost any other month. So the lounge access is pretty useful for me.If renewing the Citi Prestige is not a good deal  any other cards to recommend?🤣,btohqsg
Citi card is worth it for the citi payall if u have usage for it. If not can just keep jumping ard. Uob vi is 645 af and give 40k miles for exisiting customer and 80k for new customer if u can spend 4k in 30days,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I have a question about using the Maybank Family & Friends Card with the Amaze Card for Malaysia spending.If I pay at a furniture store in Malaysia (MCC 5712) using Amaze linked to my Maybank F&F card  will the transaction still qualify for the 8% cashback under the Malaysia spending category? I’m concerned because Amaze converts MYR to SGD  so I’m not sure if it will still count as Malaysia spending.Would appreciate any insights or experiences with this. Thanks!,btohqsg
Ok will have a look at that! maybe consider Vantage too. But the 4k spend in 30 days might be tough for me to hit as spending is pretty low 🫠,btohqsg
Dbs vantage also 4k spending  but upon payment of annual gfee u get 25k miles  extra 15k when u hit 4k. But uob have many priority access to concert which is more useful for me haha,btohqsg
Need to use card directly to charge in myr,btohqsg
Vantage only 10 pp while vi is unlimited dragon with 1 guest,btohqsg
That particular category in local spend already hit? If not it will take up the local spend quota first.,btohqsg
I see! ok i will compare renewing Citi Prestige vs UOB VI. Thanks so much 😁,btohqsg
1. Yes  5k miles is for new to UOB KF offer.,btohqsg
But recently we got $500 for Ma  so only $3500 for Jan 2025,btohqsg
I think furniture mcc doesnt fall under any of the selected category,btohqsg
Other spend is a category unfortunately lol,btohqsg
25k miles is about 375$ (at 1.5cpm).You travel often. Id consider the ability to have meal then relax at the lounge is a big bonus. (And unlimited +1)And if your payall can hit limo req  545$ is already paid for itself.,btohqsg
I have no issue with Kris+ refund   but not travel company,btohqsg
Only time will tell if cpf will activate the transfer to SA/OA,btohqsg
Dun pair with amaze if want to be under MYR category  cause Amaze convert to SGD  pay with maybank family and friend directly and pay in MYR.,btohqsg
$500 is this year or next year? New BHS only in effect next year. So why do you take $500 off for next year?,btohqsg
This year max is 71500  next year max is 75500  but now is 72000  unless they will move the $500 out to SA,btohqsg
It's likely going to be treated like MA interest  31 Dec they will put in MA  and move to SA or OA (if SA hits FRS) on 1 Jan.,btohqsg
Hi guys  checking if favepay and shopback pay or applepay use Uob one card to pay  does it qualify for the base 3.33 % cashback spend?,btohqsg
But vantage comes with accorplus.. UOB VI other benefits quite sad,btohqsg
Hi for tax income on cpf self contrribution  what happen if self contribution exceed thr cpf annual limit? Am i still elogible of tax income reduction?,btohqsg

Thanks. Any work around like transfer OA to SA?,btohqsg

Hello  can I ask if I use the Citi reward cc pair with amaze card  then pay with amaze card. Then have a refund for my purchase  will it reflect on the Citi bank ? How does it work,btohqsg
can be refund to amaze wallet  linked card to Amaze or citi rewards card,btohqsg
so in my Citi bank statement I’ll still need to pay the amount?,btohqsg
generally if a refund is credited back  it will be reflected as green positive amount. usually  no need to pay.but  please double check with the CSO.,btohqsg
Have. Those 1.3% cashback and below one have cashback.,btohqsg
If it's domestic spend  your amaze domestic spend quota will be eaten also.,btohqsg

Thanks alot for confirming on SCBIf citi waived annual fee do trigger giro then will be a problemThen i need to cancel giro on inactive citi cards or another way is request for refund? Do you do this too? Thanks🙏,btohqsg
Citi can allow transfer out of excess credit into your active card.,btohqsg
If you have a Citi bank account  you can ask them to transfer the excess to it or to another active card. I do not recommend asking them to do a cheque payment back to you as it will incur cost of about $2-3 for banks to process that cheque,btohqsg
I think nowadays got PayNow method. UOB retuned me excess through PayNow.,btohqsg
Stupid Citibank. They did this to me on my CRMC renewal and insist that I either transfer the amount to another card or they give me a cheque. I get EGA giro cash back so I didn’t want them to transfer to another card 😑Edit. I made a mistake on the card. Prestige strictly no waiver 😅,btohqsg

hi all  im looking to submit the GIRO form to pay taxes in monthly instalments (EGA -> IRAS). i saw a video on youtube saying that IRAS will bear the cost of the postage. when you guys set this up  you simply head to singpost and write the address and thats it?also  the first repayment will be from apr 2025 through till mar 2026?^ oops. i got the answer for this — on the GIRO form it states that monthly GIRO deductions will begin once it is approved  and subsequently in May each year  to April of the following year.,btohqsg
For postage yes. There is a form for you to fill in. And just write iras on the envelope.Are you on monthly tax payment plan?,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony! Yup I got the form filled up. I selected monthly plan. Is there anything else that I need to do other than submitting the GIRO form?So again  just grab an envelope and write IRAS and mail it? I don’t think SingPost provides free envelopes right? 😂,btohqsg
Just do eGIRO. They recently accepted eGIRO from HSBC.,btohqsg

If you can go down and paywave  UOB VS (capped at 2k for 4mpd) and UOB PPV (must do mobile contactless  capped at 1100 for 4mpd) would be good.,btohqsg
I do some in-app purchases on iOS and it is that MCC. I use Amaze CRMC for 4mpd. Apple charges have DCC and charges from Luxembourg so using Amaze really helps if you dislike seeing some weird charges thrown in.,btohqsg

You still got tax relief to get from RSTU/VCMA for this year?,btohqsg
Or top up in Jan next 2025 ?,btohqsg
Have u topped up this year?,btohqsg
Top up last December last year,btohqsg
If you want to reduce tax this year  then do it this year. Topping up in Jan will be counted for next year tax reduction.,btohqsg
But why cpf say Jan top up better?,btohqsg
Best is top up on last few days of the month. As interest is counted on first of the month on lower value.,btohqsg
Hi all  should I top up SA or SRS? I am in mid 30s. I am still wondering which one better 😅,btohqsg
to earn 'more' interest... their perspective is different..January 2025 vs December 2025we are comparing December 2024 and January 2025,btohqsg
See whether u good in investment or not. If good then srs. If not good then sa.,btohqsg
Sa can't take out lor so consider not wise until u later in life plus u still young,btohqsg
i have differing viewif you do own investments  you should not topup SA or SRS since both are trapped moneyyou can use the cash 'outside' to earn more than the tax savings  without any restrictions,btohqsg
Objective is to save tax if high income brackets . 😂,btohqsg
my view is SRS isn't worth the tax savings as your money is trapped for too long and while trapped it cannot do anything.,btohqsg
Just different views. Won't say it trap. Just safety buffers for more conservative strategies.,btohqsg
invest in singapore market not much restrictions,btohqsg
See yourself. He is right for his cases. I am right for my cases. No right and wrong one.,btohqsg
gentle reminder that the SRS tax relief is still under the $80k global tax relief...,btohqsg
Assuming topping up is for tax reliefs  picking to RSTU or top-up SRS depends on your need of the money to be liquid.SA will be fully locked up until CPF withdrawal age.SRS will be locked up until SRS withdrawal age  but can be withdrawn anytime before with penalties.,btohqsg
To give some context  a female with 2 kids  and earning $150 000 assessable income will no longer have any use for Tax Relief schemes like Topping up CPF or SRS.,btohqsg
Depends also  the amounts charged at 7% maybe still able to beat easily  but amounts charged from 11.5% onwards  it's a sure way to reduce taxes  and still know the monies are yours (and earning 4% p.a. interest if SA  or 7-11% p.a. interest if invested SRS).,btohqsg
even if on 22% and above tax bracket.. the money is locked for say 20 years..you just need to beat SRS investments by 2% consistently can liao.,btohqsg
https://www.salary.sg/2009/whats-not-good-about-supplementary-retirement-scheme-srs/this is an old article but still somewhat in line with my thinking...the 'one off' tax savings isn't worth the tens of years lockin,btohqsg
FYI: This article was written in 2009 before lower cost platforms and digital advisors come to Singapore,btohqsg
yeah i guess the 'opportunity cost' might have been lowered..but the principle of the tax savings needing to be divided by the number of years of lock in remain.,btohqsg
Anyone else having issues getting into chocolate finance app?,btohqsg
Try using your mobile data instead of wifi. I have problem log in using wifi.,btohqsg

My srs are all invested into local banks... Tax savings of 10+%  and it gives me dividend yield of 5+%  with capital appreciation. Why not?!,btohqsg
you can do the same with cash outside SRS..and yes the only difference is you don't get the ONE OFF tax savings of as you say 10%+but you have so much more flexibility with the cash outside SRS. Profits you can take out and buy another house immediately for example,btohqsg
Agree  but I see it as local banks being part of my portfolio  so instead of using cash  I'm using srs. But srs needs to be built up slowly while using cash  I can buy one shot at once. So I agree on the flexibity.,btohqsg

hi i currently have 150k in uob one account and 100k in poems money market fund which is only earning 2.6%.i am thinking of transferring the 100k from poems to ocbc 360 account.i understand uob one dun need salary crediting just need 3 giro payment. so i can change my salary crediting to ocbc 360 and enough 4% from uob one and 4.65% from ocbc 360what do u guys think of this strategy.has anyone one park money in but uob one and ocbc 360 using this strategy?,btohqsg
U dont need real salary crediting but u still need salary crediting for uob one to hit the 4 percent. Real salary can direct to ocbc360 if u can fulfill the other criteria,btohqsg
i just gotta maintain 2k in the account right? no need to credit 2k salary monthly or keep transfering in 2k whatsoever,btohqsg
That'll yield you EIR 2% p.a. on UOB One account.,btohqsg
You need to transfer in $2k monthly.,btohqsg
thanks for the confirmation queenie.hi melyvn is 4% for uob one.,btohqsg

@MelvynEziahh icic. i'm quite new to all these hoops i gotta jump thru to get higher interests/perks on these accounts. am planning to use uob one as my main spending account and hsbc ega to pay credit cards bills  what would be the best way of going about this?,btohqsg
Every 1st of month deposit $2k into HSBC EGA and transfer out 5 x $400 will do.,btohqsg
can transfer out the 5x $400 immediately after i transfer in?,btohqsg
what i used to do:* keep ard 100k in uob one (back when uob one has 100k cap)* keep 1k ish in dbs for daily spend* keep 2k in hsbc ega. Every month  I have recurring transfer from uob 2k into hsbc ega and recurring 5x 400 from hsbc ega back to uob.* transfer amount for credit card bills/tax before due dates,btohqsg
sorry just to kiasu abit if i immediately transfer out the 5x $400 i won't kenna the fall below fee right? and what is ur strategy now?,btohqsg
I also want to know. I already registered using the HMSG link but very confusing instructions on Moo Moo. Seems like you 1) deposit  2) subscribe to a fund  3) wait for 30 days for the first yield enhancement coupon  4) after 30 days you have to go in to click to choose the coupon otherwise default to the trading coupon  5) repeat step 2 to get another yield enhancement coupon. After all these hassle  you get 2 coupons that you need to use within 60 days  to subscribe to another investment  then you can get the yield enhancement. It seems waay too much effort  and the EIR will be super low since you need to use a total of 60 days as you need to use 30 days to get a yield enhancement coupon and another 30 days to use that same yield enhancement coupon.,btohqsg
Where to put for the left over balance? Buy stock/etf?,btohqsg

Eh if you can’t get the SQ flight you want  will you have use for those EVA miles? If you have a way to use them up then sure why not.,btohqsg
ahh ok good point there  with SQ if i cant use the points i still can transfer out to kris+ to use it at merchants. eva air i might not be able to use it as easily,btohqsg

marathon the only 2 conditions are:1. a certain day must be $100k above a certain day. (QUALIFYING CRITERIA)2. incremental fresh fund balances on top of the benchmark ADB will earn the marathon bonus interest rate,btohqsg

Hi all. I started my investment journey with Blue Chip under OCBC. Subsequently  I closed off the Blue Chip account in OCBC with the invested money returned to me.

Thanks. Assuming fulfilling the $2k transfer in and 5 transactions in both Dec & Jan  it won't qualify for the additional 1% interest? Or has the EIR already counted in?,btohqsg
EIR already counted in. Only the 100k is eligible  that's why a drop to 3.71% p.a.,btohqsg
maybe i rephrase it?December = 4.05% p.a for $30k but only from 17th December to 31st DecemberJanuary = 3.05% p.a. on $30k for a month + 4.05% p.a. on $100k for a month,btohqsg

If I have participate in HSBC ega in Oct. For dec I can't participate?,btohqsg
From my belief it is:1. Keep aum until gift fulfilment date for singsaver gift2. But Citigold will have penalty if you don’t maintain aum while being Citigold customer3. Citigold will impose penalty if u close Citigold within 6 months,btohqsg
If you referring to Bonus Interest promo  cannot,btohqsg
Makes sense  many thanks. Am trying to weigh opportunity cost while placing funds with them,btohqsg
I’m curious why u wanna do singsaver promo for Citigold. It ain’t that great from what I read. Since u cannot double dip.You either get1. Singsaver giftOr2. Citibank giftNot both,btohqsg
Sometimes it's still best to read the T&Cs carefully and not rely too much on AI.,btohqsg
This is also only half the story.Citibank side will have own lock in period,btohqsg
I do not see any restriction on receiving Citibank offering. What the T&C seems to indicate that one will be getting gifts from both sides,btohqsg
Where u saw can get both side,btohqsg
Read this with clause 8 (above screenshot)  so to play safe  better deposit 250k before end Feb for Dec account opening  and maintain it till singsaver rewards are fufilled.,btohqsg
Still cannot  tried Microsoft edge  Firefox  Chrome 🥲,btohqsg
Yeah I had my suspicion too  SingSaver verification and awarding of gift dates,btohqsg
But I'm not going for Citibank NTB promo... Why should I be subjected to their T&Cs so long as my account is in good standing order?,btohqsg
Both on desktop and mobile? Like literally different devices,btohqsg
All priority banks will have early closure and minimum aum requirements.,btohqsg
Yes  this I understand. But that is a seperate matter and won't affect rewards given out by singsaver.,btohqsg
I didn’t say Citibank side will affect singsaver rewards.I said Citibank will still have their own lock in period.,btohqsg
Hey. Question for savings accounts.Say I already have some basic savings accounts. To get more interest  I were to open those high interest rate ones.Does that mean I need to meet minimum amount in EACH account otherwise I got charged for service fee? In a way  some money got stuck there?,btohqsg
Some of the accounts don't charge fall below fee in the first 6 months  and also don't charge closure fee after first 6 months.But better to decide on what accounts to keep  especially if keeping minimum amounts on certain accounts can affect greatly (i.e.  move you down a tier).Not good to close savings account too often also  the bank might decide to terminate any relationship.,btohqsg
Not too sure how different banks treat that... But for DBS  as I'm under treasures  fall below fees for other accounts are waived.Best is to check with the bank directly.,btohqsg
Hard to answer cos there's no cost for it. Whether how beneficial is priority banking depends on how much you need or enjoy their services. It let me skip queues whenever I need physically bank over the counter  but now lots of transactions can do online. Lounge access is not fantastic and it's not near my house so can't be bothered to visit there just for free coffee n snacks.,btohqsg
Do you see your asset growth with them better than self investment? Assume you must put certain $$&,btohqsg
Usually priority banking doesn’t have attractive products to grow your money well. Use priority banking only to milk new to priority banking rewards and continue using the good high yield account offered to mass market.For real investments either u use discount brokers yourself or try to hit the private banking tier of the foreign banks to get access to the decent investment products.What products is not for me to advise. U need to talk to a licensed financial professional authorised to speak to u (and not out to just earn your high commission). And no. Not insurance agent.(Not bespoke financial advice).,btohqsg
I didn't get any investment product from them. Why do you think I have? BTW I was invited with waiver of AUM  but eventually I use their brokerage to buy local shares and plus my multiplier account balance  I was able to hit the AUM. Alternatively  one can also buy via fsmone  transfer to cdp  then into custodian to hit the AUM. I didn't do so cos I liked it's no min commission trading.,btohqsg
thanks for sharing  I have priority banking with other banks and not see the benefits.,btohqsg
from what i see so far.. priority bank is just a camouflaged term where the bank tags you as more harvestable for high margin products like insurance  unit trusts  and structured products. They cannot really offer you the decent products by design of their inferior platform.you need to get to at least priority private or asia treasures (not sure what the latest term is)... before they are allowed to offer you the real AI stuff.,btohqsg

""Supercharge"" SA/OA strategy.If you already hit FRS on SA  any contributions to SA will continue to stay in SA. This gives you slightly more opportunities for tax reliefs because you won't have MA overflowing to SA.",btohqsg

Erm why divide by 31 acct open today then it from today to month end to count mab,btohqsg
From what i experienced when opening uob one  it will be divided by days count of the month to calculate MAB (i.e 31). For uob lady saving acct  it will only count from opening date to month end. Id assume uob stash will be similar to uob one.See Queenie’s comment.,btohqsg

You already at no option lol.So far I've reinstalled banking apps for most of the banks  the one that gives the most issue is SCB  which time and time again I've said their app is the worst.,btohqsg
HahahaAm hoping in such a big group  whether anyone also kenaI called DBS and the staff says for a few hours there's this issue but mine is more than a few hoursYa some after reinstalling need 24 hours cooling period  which is still okBut some can't be set up immediately meaning losing access for a while and can be a few daysFor DBS i remember it should be not an issueHaha thank you!,btohqsg

I want to call out ShopBack Expedia again. I just received this email screaming 14% Expedia cashback today but when I open ShopBack Expedia it is 10%. I would like to ask if anyone saw the 14% cashback and managed to book and get 14% tracked?To recap I still have a pending complaint with ShopBack that when I booked it 12-2am on a 14% day it was only tracked at 12.5%. And yes I know it is % on a reduced (less taxes) amount not the entire gross amount. It’s exactly 12.5% on the reduced amount.,btohqsg
Update for people here. Another chat discussed this further. Got even more ridiculous. Different people seeing different ShopBack cashback levels for Expedia.Ranges from 10-14%. For real!,btohqsg
Maybe shopback also do target customer thingy liao,btohqsg
Yes we speculating as such. That’s disgusting,btohqsg
Mine showing 14% but I not booking anything so I can't give any dp for cashback tracked haha,btohqsg
No problem sir. Thanks for updating.Let’s see if any 14% person booked today and can share result tomorrow during tracking.,btohqsg
I ask another friend what's the cashback shown. Waiting for reply. My shopback account quite fresh  like only registered since Sep 24.,btohqsg

Hi experts  Standard Chartered refused to waive my late charge and interest incurred to my Simply Cash credit card. I overlooked on 27 Nov to pay  and when they sms me on 2 Dec  I immediately pay on the same day  2 Dec. It is my first time and I'm just not happy that I request for waiver  they rejected. My question here are:1) Can I just pay whatever outstanding amount (except the late charge and interest)  then cancel the card?2) I also have Bonus account with them. Will they deduct the late charge and interest amount from my Bonus account?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  does anyone know how to get an air ticket (Biz Class) at a discounted price?I would greatly appreciate it if the gurus could share or PM me.,btohqsg
But it's really a late payment.So either suck thumb and pay  or keep pushing for waiverIf i'm not wrong they wont let u cancel the card unless u pay in full. if not the charges will also incurr fee.At the end they might close your relationship with them.,btohqsg
If you have other cards and SC is not your sole card  you can let them know you will terminate the card if the late fee cannot be waived.,btohqsg
If you have taken any sign up rewards  make sure you’re clear of the period for holding the card as well as there might be claw backs.,btohqsg
ya i know it's really a late payment. but my first time n I've been with them at least 10 years...n i paid on the same day when they sms me...ok la...think all these are excuses. actually i'm ok even close my bonus a/c with them. i'm just afraid they will take money from my bonus account to pay the late charge of $100.,btohqsg
Some people just pay up  and close all account. Then earn it back using Sign up bonus 🙂,btohqsg
Unless you're a really high net worth individual  banks don't care if you 10 year or 100 years with them. Late means late  just pay up the fees and move on. Best to set alarm to make payment on the day of statement.I 15 years customer  1 day late payment they also reject my request of waiver.,btohqsg
but usually have a waiting period is it? meaning if i close this month Dec  then they have a sign up bonus in Jan...i may not be qualify to apply?,btohqsg
Some banks are more lenient with late fee waiver than others. SC seems very strict lately,btohqsg
I believe they have the right but they won't.They will let the amount snowball with the interest and then send you a lawyer letter further down the road. They will make more money off you this way.Not to mention your credit bureau records will be affected and you may not get credit that easily next time,btohqsg
Not worth getting into trouble over the $100 late fee.,btohqsg
Think u need 12 months mdm!,btohqsg
Ya just $100  and remember  the subsequent interest they calculate is DAILY  so best to pay off before next bill comes.,btohqsg
thank you all for your advice. thought i can escape it 🥲,btohqsg
Unless you prefer to fight a losing battle and pay them thousands instead of the $100 late fee lol,btohqsg
$100 means a lot to me 😭,btohqsg
Take it as lesson and set a calendar/reminder to pay bill on time.,btohqsg
pay the late fee  and proceed with the termination.they will ask for the termination reason.u then tell the real reason.who knows they will refund you.,btohqsg
Good idea! Hope that they will do so....Thank you!,btohqsg

PSA / Warning on Amaze's latest OTP changeWith the latest change in Amaze's online transaction authorisation method (from SMS / email OTP) to in-app authorisation  it actually means if a hacker knows your Amaze Login and Amaze Password  he can do EVERYTHING:1. change your password2. see your amaze card details  including CVV (when he originally didn't know)3. switch between linked cards (even though u set to empty wallet for safety)4. APPROVE online transactionsThis is clearly a security flaw to me as there is no longer any second level security measure protecting you.I have highlighted this to Amaze Instarem as a major security flaw but if one person says so  they may not bother.I urge more of you to feedback this major issue to Amaze via live chat if you are a worried user like me.P.S. this concern is real. There is already at least one genuine hack encountered by a reliable chat friend that prompted me to contact Amaze. That chat friend's family member Instarem Account got hacked and fraudulent transactions could immediately be approved since the hacker has FULL ACCESS to your Instarem Account and able to approve online transactions by just knowing your login and password.,btohqsg

Calendar month so this won't work. And by posting date btw.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows any good place to park 50k and to maximize returns?,btohqsg
If your spending of $1000 or more is spent 2- 3 days before your statement date  either you hope that they cleared and posted before your statement date or you call them to expedite the process.,btohqsg

u talking about uob lady? it is by posted date in calendar month  not statement month,btohqsg
they want to save money on SMS mah,btohqsg
Ok that's mean even if I spend after my statement mth   I still won't get the bonus for the 2nd $1000  that is spend right ? since both $1000 is on the same mth,btohqsg
Yup. Calender month posted transaction over 1k will only earn 0.4 mpd,btohqsg

May check on the transfer of OA to SA?,btohqsg
Is there any minimum balance to be kept in OA before you able to transfer OA to SA?,btohqsg
Is the amount transfered from OA to SA is a reserved amount that cannot be used for CPF shielding (ie. Invest in SSB right before 55 years old)?,btohqsg
There's no such thing as SA shielding anymore.,btohqsg
If you are bellow 55 years old?,btohqsg
There is no more SA after 55 years old.No more 4% account that can be withdrawn at any time.,btohqsg
At 55  SA closes. Any investments sold will flow to RA if haven't hit FRS  or OA if already hit.,btohqsg
Question: For SA balance that was transferred from OA can it be invested?,btohqsg
You can invest. But can you find an investment that pays above 4% consistently and your capital is protected?,btohqsg
Just wanna to confirm that it can be invested.,btohqsg
Cause i tought once you transfer OA to SA  it will be reserved to form RA even before 55 years old,btohqsg
Yes  only above first 40k. The question is why? The investable products will never beat the risk free 4% p.a. that CPF is giving.,btohqsg
Usually SA balances people just leave it alone. Don’t do anything with it.,btohqsg
Only RSTU and its interests earned cannot be used for anything else other than RA.,btohqsg
If meet BHS and FRS  once reach 55 years old  any amount above BHS Ba FRS can be withdraw anytime?,btohqsg
Willnever(the better phrase is very highly unlikely) be higher. It's deliberately clamped down to only allow lower risk investments (with lower yield) to be bought.,btohqsg
BHS isnot a minimum sum  it's a limit. MA functions the same after 55. Anything in OA can be withdrawn anytime after 55.,btohqsg

Hi Chris  I signed up via Singsaver already and approved yesterday. Not sure if this question is asked but is this $370 cash stackable with the current Citibank promo of 40 000 ThankYou points for hitting $800 within first 2 months of approval?,btohqsg
"Hi   I cancelled my Citi bank credit card 1.5 years ago and have had no existing accounts with them since.Can anyone confirm if those Singsaver/Moneysmart Citi New-to-bank rewards are still applicable? Given that this is stated in the T&Cs""For clarity  an existing Citibank Credit Card account includes a prior applicationfor any Citibank Credit Card that has been approved by Citibank Bank even if thephysical Citibank Credit Card has not been received by the customer and/or has notbeen activated or utilized by the customer.""",btohqsg
As long within that period as stated in t&c  you have no other Citibank CC that was approved.,btohqsg
That quoted T&C seems like something that was added recently. If my understanding it correct  it means as long as you previously ever had a Citi credit card  you will never be considered NTB anymore?,btohqsg
Did you check any other clauses that states the NTB period?,btohqsg
"Yes  it did state the usual 12 months period that thing everyone knows about (the ""loophole"").But this new terms effectively negates this loophole.",btohqsg
You answered yourself on the NTB period. Nothing is changed  and it's not even a loophole.,btohqsg
"I agree  except on this point which I don't recall previously seeing""For clarity  an existing Citibank Credit Card account includes a prior applicationfor any Citibank Credit Card that has been approved by Citibank Bank even if thephysical Citibank Credit Card has not been received by the customer and/or has notbeen activated or utilized by the customer.""",btohqsg
It means citi will now additionally check if you were previous Citi card holder (even before 12 months period). If yes  then Citi won't treat you as NTB,btohqsg
It seems like you did not read UOB KF TnC. Only 7 OTAs with SQ min $800 requirements will be awarded with 3mpd. Suggest you read the card TnC before using the card.,btohqsg
Not sure why you're mixing both clauses. Do you have another Citibank CC that's approved but not activated?,btohqsg
I have entirely closed all my Citibank accounts about 1.5 years ago and no applications submitted. So I would think i should be considered NTB already. (according to the 12 months terms).But this new term is confusing me.31. An “Existing Customer” refers to applicants who meet the following conditions:i. has an existing Citibank Credit Card account** For clarity  an existing Citibank Credit Card account includes a prior applicationfor any Citibank Credit Card that has been approved by Citibank Bank even if thephysical Citibank Credit Card has not been received by the customer and/or has notbeen activated or utilized by the customer.,btohqsg
If i'm reading it correctly  Citi basically is stopping people from churning the rewards,btohqsg
"There's nothing confusing. Some people think that if they receive the CC but don't activate  they are considered as ""NTB"" for ""unused card"".",btohqsg
not sure how u interpret like that,btohqsg
Hmm  did anyone try doing this NTB churning strat with Citi in the last 3-6months and was succesful?,btohqsg
I am fairly certain this term did not exist at least 1+ year back,btohqsg
Because people blur think never activate means ok. Have to cancel even if unactivated.,btohqsg
I dont think anyone has succeeded with that. Citi just added that to make it clear.,btohqsg
Wait. We are still at “card approved and received the card but not activated”,btohqsg
