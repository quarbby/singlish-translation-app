hi your tiny dino is no longer jobless (hopefully),btohqsg
This is exactly why you should abstain or take the necessary precautions like morning after pills and birth control plus condoms.,btohqsg
The fucker called the police on the girls dad for threatening him to not go near his daughter agn,btohqsg
Call the police on him for having underage sex.,btohqsg
The guy found himself another gf 2 months later ah,btohqsg
I think that even if I’m 30  and married  my dad would still have done that. I’d like to think.,btohqsg
technically police can't even be involved unless the girl didn't give consent,btohqsg
Unless they’re both at least 18  its the legally grey area.,btohqsg
How do you know so much about this,btohqsg
If both 16 shld be ok,btohqsg
If the kid is born before sept,btohqsg
That’s illegal and charges could be pressed.,btohqsg
u cant be older than me,btohqsg
That's good but not alw the case la,btohqsg
But ya la at least make sure it's safe,btohqsg
But ya la only 100% foolproof way to not get preggo is to not fuck,btohqsg
Sex ed is the most useless shit ever,btohqsg
Being happy still could entail struggling with the matter.,btohqsg
well  without sex ed  I wldnt have known agree,btohqsg
Fr that guy needs his dick chopped,btohqsg
Its not explicitly in your syllabus,btohqsg
ass sia bro got a girl preg and got a gf in 2 months,btohqsg
They don’t teach legal age of consent,btohqsg
if u looking for high birth rates,btohqsg
find this guy  he can do ur job,btohqsg
Some ppl rly r scummy la,btohqsg
Bro the guy has been the laughing stock of our batch ever since,btohqsg
I don’t rmb shit about sex ed,btohqsg
oh so he's gonna piss thru his ads,btohqsg
@kohsyanYesterday I almost added make it physically impossible for you to reproduce ever into my threat btw.,btohqsg
I just rmb the ABC stuff of prevention,btohqsg
They need to teach abt things other than abstinence,btohqsg
Why are you advocating or encouraging for this instead? Not exactly a healthy alternative. Besides  if you’ve never done the deed before  I’d assume that you wouldn’t have needs with no experience  right?,btohqsg
Exactly. Not everyone can be Lorelai Gilmore.,btohqsg
Imo it's btr to fuck yourself literally than fuck someone else if can't deal with the consequences,btohqsg
Man sounds like a vietnam vet,btohqsg
For the lack of btr words,btohqsg
I can imagine him with a cig in hand and eyes looking far ahead,btohqsg
hey id gladly take the job of being a sex ed educator  no one listens and your job can be done with peace,btohqsg
Kids know way more than you think,btohqsg
it’s ok the threat was good enough,btohqsg
There’s the fact that if you haven’t had it? You couldn’t miss it.,btohqsg
💀 go ahead you're one step away after the thirst traps,btohqsg
and can’t cause death unlike building a plane,btohqsg
My parents nvr bother teaching me cuz they know I alrd know 💀,btohqsg
Eternally dubbed the overcooked child of the family,btohqsg
i would like to invite all members on this group to travel with the plane I built,btohqsg
Quite funny to act innocent when I actually know what's gg on last time,btohqsg
I'm going to be the innovative plane engineer. with 2 engines with the energy of one  and the turbines of the engines to generate power for the lights in the cabin,btohqsg
Nobody ever gave me the burts and bees talk  just assuming that as a physically disabled person  I’d never get to do the deed. Still learnt way to early another way when my Dad is an addict to porn.,btohqsg
ill wait till the day you n ur gf goes on a honeymoon and then y'all on flight and the pilot goes like 'hi  this is your captain  pocoyo the second  speaking',btohqsg
bros gonna kys right at that moment bfr any tragedy happens,btohqsg
Don’t you dare kill their happily ever after.,btohqsg
I'll be like holy shit  that's bezzo,btohqsg
I think pilot eyesight can’t be too bad either,btohqsg
One  is this what everyone assumes,btohqsg
we will land on a beach with bitches.,btohqsg
we're a great match for pilots,btohqsg
Land on like that cat island in Japan,btohqsg
for the time being @itchybqcksidelearn your superposition,btohqsg
I haven't finished the lecture sia,btohqsg
I’m gonna be working on stuff later with a fever,btohqsg
guys  who wants me to buy them a bombardier !,btohqsg
I'll gladly give u for free,btohqsg
I realise I got more experience with aero than I thought,btohqsg
Two  who here can relate to having the experience of watching m18 shows and their relatives have the perfect timing to walk in every time a m18 matters scene is happening and not show the actual plot of the show overall?,btohqsg
building rocket rn then designed airfoils before,btohqsg
have no idea whats in the prg w data is going on so,btohqsg
have a fun chat on random stuff,btohqsg
I could but one step at a time lol,btohqsg
talked to myself in third person too many times till I rly became third person viewer,btohqsg
wait till they walk in to one of ur tiktoks,btohqsg
i am dying to know my fathers acct because i finna block him too,btohqsg
oshit ive been there done that but this year my dad found my bottle of absolut,btohqsg
This is exactly why I don’t use TikTok,btohqsg
my dad was just like u can drink but not outside,btohqsg
I rmb being in Poland in my teens,btohqsg
we were at a restaurant for dinner and there was a shot glass,btohqsg
By teens I mean 14 btw,btohqsg
it was part of the package so we just ate what they gave,btohqsg
then as we were leaving I downed the shot glass cos I thought it was water,btohqsg
My mum then shoved me a 1.5 litre bottle of water to chug,btohqsg
Just follow the messages I responded to.,btohqsg
Just me then? Its like a parent sense or smith.,btohqsg
just give a tldr im not focusing on a para of sentences when im thinking of codes,btohqsg
either tt or just let snorlax n kuro ans,btohqsg
I feel like I hate the weather  its making my chronic pain act up rn.,btohqsg
@VoidchordsCan you summarise it for me please,btohqsg
I’m going to go stick my leg in an oven now.,btohqsg
I am going to run the world out of its paracetamol supply,btohqsg
not rlly since I’m only taking 2 every like 8 hours,btohqsg
Answer my questions before you do. Read the messages I replied to earlier.,btohqsg
Not possible. I can give you more of the nauseating medicine if you run out.,btohqsg
why you asking someone in pain to reply to u nani,btohqsg
I’m going to run the world out of its acorxia supply.,btohqsg
My epitaph is gonna say “passed away while replying to SGExams”,btohqsg
Because I enjoy being an a level pain in the neck,btohqsg
I’ll reply you Gwyn in due time,btohqsg
Lmao  don’t you dare die on your girlfriend or the threat still applies.,btohqsg
tmr going NTU meet my supervisor too,btohqsg
Fun fact: I’m deadly allergic to neurofen,btohqsg
I’m waiting for pfizer if my doctor insists that I need another booster.,btohqsg
I’d just cancel at this point,btohqsg
Before you die. And don’t you dare die on your girlfriend or the threat is still valid.,btohqsg
Wait  no. I was asking if its automatically assumed that people with physical disabilities would never have sex.,btohqsg
Ibuprofen also can cause stomach turbulence.,btohqsg
Can’t you just epi pen yourself then call an ambulance,btohqsg
Yea don’t worry. I’ll take note,btohqsg
eh if u have a bad headache,btohqsg
uh stand in a place where the ground is warm barefooted n face the sun,btohqsg
I don’t understand how that helps,btohqsg
Isn’t that just progressively worse with each shot,btohqsg
My friend is 70 minutes late.,btohqsg
i only had 1 day of sickness on my second shot,btohqsg
No like how do I track it bruh,btohqsg
I just can’t deal with the chronic pain of sitting down,btohqsg
I wouldn’t mind if my pain isn’t flaring up from the weather.,btohqsg
sorry uncle I think udw know also,btohqsg
I’m not excusing her  but she did say 3  instead of 2.,btohqsg
My entire primary school life with a friend.,btohqsg
Your name is really mr physics now,btohqsg
She said she was coming at 2  changed her mind at 1:50.,btohqsg
Because I had to sit down before she came.,btohqsg
She said that she got lazy.,btohqsg
I can’t feel my leg anymore,btohqsg
And she isn’t even here yet.,btohqsg
Anybody here was from the primary school gifted programmes and was accepted?,btohqsg
u ask if anyone was from gep den u said accepted. if they're not accepted how r they in gep huhh,btohqsg
oh i mean like they scored well for the gep test,btohqsg
to get accepeted as a candidate or something,btohqsg
not every p3 cohort was given the chance to participate in the gep,btohqsg
I was accepted for GEP but that’s 16 years ago for me,btohqsg
Cannot compare to normies like us,btohqsg
I only got thru first round,btohqsg
why is this even appearing like what are you studying,btohqsg
Hello I am jc1 I'm not uni,btohqsg
I mean physical Chem is literally physics LOL,btohqsg
all your electron cloud stuff also derived from quantum mechanics,btohqsg
is coz of superposition in nucleus,btohqsg
I mean if you got any questions about the physics stuff lmk lol,btohqsg
I throw away all my spho knowlrdge,btohqsg
there’s a force that’s purely quantum mechanical,btohqsg
Going straight into the linear algebra stuff,btohqsg
you can take h2 because of how easy it is,btohqsg
“No heat engine can be more efficient than the Carnot engine” - Carnot,btohqsg
hold up isnt your exams over,btohqsg
physical chem is the only chem I know sia,btohqsg
that’s why the isotherm question that time I know,btohqsg
we need to get u something to do..,btohqsg
but the phys u learn in chem,btohqsg
but no joke classical mechanics is guarded by F = dp/dt,btohqsg
at least it’s time independent right,btohqsg
If I don’t return until tomorrow,btohqsg
Its safe to assume that it has killed me.,btohqsg
I see myself chugging down the drink tho I spent $8 on it,btohqsg
ok which fren want go w me,btohqsg
Nb I dun even drink Starbucks,btohqsg
I think this year I only drank,btohqsg
Why is Starbucks worth it tho,btohqsg
Like what makes it so good,btohqsg
Bcz for me the coffee don't work 💀,btohqsg
I only drink if got offer and if got xmas drink,btohqsg
Also their choco cake damn shiok but rob bank price,btohqsg
50% off xmas drinks I think,btohqsg
Occasionally drink is ok lah but get their card lo,btohqsg
And now my headache is better,btohqsg
taste nice  that's why I finish fast then money fly,btohqsg
i buy when i no motivation,btohqsg
i mean the caffeinated drinks if its damn sweet  lasts me whole day,btohqsg
so its worth for me cuz i dont need to buy a crap ton of random drinks,btohqsg
how do y'all resist finishing it in one gulp 😭,btohqsg
See pocoyo now your chance to try,btohqsg
But the queue sure rabak af,btohqsg
the p in pocoyo is not patient,btohqsg
my body cant stand over sweet n milky stuff at a fast rate,btohqsg
so i just drink it damn slow,btohqsg
Past 2 years covid so cannot have long queue,btohqsg
the moment it turned 2 queue started alr for 1 for 1,btohqsg
but last time I drank Starbucks was i gotta say,btohqsg
I can't chiong milk-based stuff also,btohqsg
today queue at sim was so bad cuz the offer starts at 2pm  2pm NP AND SIM students both rushed so the queue was hella long,btohqsg
i tend to eat/drink very fast in general,btohqsg
SP starbucks every Wednesday or Thursday long queue also,btohqsg
n this is why ur more financially stable than me,btohqsg
All the biz people come down from the mountain,btohqsg
but I'm also a foodie so I spend quite a bit on good food,btohqsg
omg that day mr bean has 27c soy bean,btohqsg
If mr coconut got offer sure damn a lot people also,btohqsg
i'm also more financially stable cos i earn more...,btohqsg
i would do tt but i clearly dont have that much friends to go with,btohqsg
man i rmb the first time i got mr coconut it was before the whole thing exploded in popularity,btohqsg
I like coconut ice cream but mr coconut was just too much,btohqsg
as in I rmb Mr coconut not having queue last time,btohqsg
I'd rather buy the coconut icecream from motorcycle uncle,btohqsg
i go plq alot but yea not as much as snorlax,btohqsg
all my non halal food options,btohqsg
next to shilin  boost  and auntie annes,btohqsg
i always pass by cos it's connected to mrt station lol,btohqsg
eh i talk like as if parkway no mr coconut,btohqsg
Plq got this soybean thing right,btohqsg
the basement connects the closest to my condo,btohqsg
This tau huay kind of franchise,btohqsg
I mean go bugis buy clothes,btohqsg

And in Bukit Timah I flip so many times also,btohqsg
Can't be lah my niece I think already in jc,btohqsg

well my friends are all old fucks tbf,btohqsg
nah nah no one in my fam,btohqsg
No I looked clapped u wldnt even realise,btohqsg
Tbt in pri school I found out my friend is actually my cousin,btohqsg

"""why this pri sch kid lost sia""",btohqsg
His dad and my mum are cousins,btohqsg
my undergrad friends compared pics of us from like sec sch to now,btohqsg
i was the one that changed completely,btohqsg
I still got some sec school pics,btohqsg
I got one friend slim down a lot,btohqsg
Sec school most look like fetus lah,btohqsg
yea but my friends tbh look the same,btohqsg
Idk if I look the same,btohqsg
Then can go back SP prank the juniors,btohqsg
Say I just finish O level,btohqsg
Ya but can only go on Saturday,btohqsg
And I heard from a colleague,btohqsg
Once you start working your gaze will be different compared to a student,btohqsg
i can sense ur gonna start laughing,btohqsg
let me leak 13 year old siyan for a bit,btohqsg
hes a decade older my g,btohqsg
13 14 IS foetus for him,btohqsg
Any 13 or 14 is fetus to me,btohqsg
Now when people say they born post 2k,btohqsg
it's just saying we look like a child,btohqsg
I went to shower. You still haven’t answered my questions. >:(,btohqsg
Do you talk a lot too then?,btohqsg
I really feel like doing a Mr Physics series,btohqsg
You just gave me an idea of where you live. 👀,btohqsg
Mr Physics' Summary NotesG3 Physics- Read and understand quickly before exams,btohqsg
Isn’t that your nickname for him,btohqsg
coconut flavoured ice cream served in a coconut shell  topped with fresh coconut shavings,btohqsg
That outlet exists? I didn’t even know the merchandise chain existed until now.,btohqsg
Pro tip  dont think of Starbucks as a coffee  think of it as a liquid dessert,btohqsg
in case any one helping juniors with Physics  do note that there's a major wording change for conservation of energy,btohqsg
It's about energy stores  and a transfer of energy stores from one store to another,btohqsg
I'm still reading up on how it's taught and need more time to update notes,btohqsg
textbook is out in popular bookshop if anyone interested,btohqsg
it's a major change as it affects thermal energy  electrical energy  and even nuclear energy,btohqsg
expecting 2025 A level Physics to change syllabus to accommodate this,btohqsg
I love the old definition >:(,btohqsg
apparently the change started elsewhere in the world earlier,btohqsg
I'll read up and then help handle questions in the O/N group,btohqsg
Oh my gosh  my leg is still numb from the chronic nerve pain of sitting down too long earlier.,btohqsg
Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transferred from one store to another. The total energy of an isolated system remains constant.,btohqsg
we have to move with the times,btohqsg
double insulation changed to earthed metal casing,btohqsg
my time we used this.Then they change to double insulation.Then they change it back again now,btohqsg
I haven't look through it deeper,btohqsg
but no more transfer of thermal energy,btohqsg
wah one of the authors of the new textbook was my physics lecturer in JC,btohqsg
Someone just told me that they find coding a de-stressing relaxant.,btohqsg
I look forward to the day that I can successfully say that efficiently.,btohqsg
and you  mr physics  are also an author of a book !,btohqsg
differentthough I did help in one of the NA science textbook for Physics before,btohqsg
edited all the mistakes of the author,btohqsg
not everyone in this world will edit textbook  or even publish their own book  considering u n Arnold have done it  it's considered admirable,btohqsg
was paid $500 for 2 days work. Quite low  but helping friend,btohqsg
Textbook need PhD to write.I can only write guidebooks. Because gave up my PhD.,btohqsg
time to call out@kohsyanboth of y'all go work tgt,btohqsg
No leh. The author is the same since 20 years ago,btohqsg
u need MOE approval for it,btohqsg
You my how many years senior haha,btohqsg
Oh cheh saw you mentioned your JC phys lecturer just now,btohqsg
My JC lecturer was Joan Fong,btohqsg
if she is one of the authors  it's worth a read,btohqsg
I like how two people tagged me to write textbook after Jun Wei say need PhD,btohqsg
weird though to need one imo,btohqsg
it's more of a proof of ability,btohqsg
of course I think my own notes are better though,btohqsg
I mean the only thing it shows is that you know how to write publishable things,btohqsg
if anything a PhD for most kinda disconnects you from O/A levels syllabus,btohqsg
no la. Publishing it is the simple part. Selling it is the harder part. Having it effective enough to help students is the toughest part.,btohqsg
just that I don't know how to sell. I only know how to publish and how to make it effective,btohqsg
if snorlax publishes one we all run go buy,btohqsg
for now it's just gonna be research papers lol,btohqsg
I don't take physics i also go buy,btohqsg
yes you are. next time we write aerospace textbook ok,btohqsg
"""this is pocoyo  pocoyo like space  aerospace space  not spacebar space. say hi to pocoyo""",btohqsg
every week i find new material that i nvr considered,btohqsg
come let's write a new guidebook,btohqsg
hewo . i am pocoyo! today we're going to learn about the basics of aerospace technology!,btohqsg
how long did you take from beginning to end for your prev book,btohqsg
omg learning will be so much more fun,btohqsg
but it wasn't published out that time,btohqsg
following few years  took another 7 days each year to run through everything. Only after 5 years then I publish it,btohqsg
snorlax time to write a book,btohqsg
typesetting and editing is the tougher part,btohqsg
feel like formatting and stuff take a while,btohqsg
my content was consolidated from over 100+ exam papers,btohqsg
you realise at this point in time  I'm just a glorified bachelor's holder,btohqsg
guys when's the Apple education thingy like it's cheaper or can get free AirPods  or smt,btohqsg
"""the author would like to thank ____________ and _________ for helping the author out when the author was stressed""",btohqsg
bruh you ripped this from my FYP LOL,btohqsg
the author would like some coffeepls donate $1 to the author coffee fund,btohqsg
its funny but at the same time cute,btohqsg
'better be grateful I wrote this goddamn book  time to pay back $1',btohqsg
donate $1 so his CS junior will stop ranting abt code,btohqsg
then I wrote a bot to play another android phone game and then sold the account for 2.2k usd,btohqsg
that was like near 15 years ago,btohqsg
Does anyone here know abt MAC (message authentication code),btohqsg
it's fun. But it's like a game  time is gone before you noticed it,btohqsg
I do not want to be you.,btohqsg
by now I forgot most liao,btohqsg
I only use the coding methodologies to do my notes and create systems to solve questions,btohqsg
How did you achieve those coloured tabs,btohqsg
eg practical planning for A levelMy system is sure score one,btohqsg
Because what if your computer crashes,btohqsg
commonly starts in June or so,btohqsg
I would never publish those profanities.,btohqsg
Wait  really? I got mine on Amazon during a Christmas sale.,btohqsg
ouh oke  so basically poly or gg start uni liddat ah,btohqsg
yea idk if it's still going on but I heard last year got,btohqsg
just a bunch of left n right clicks,btohqsg
ya lot better than old fu-,btohqsg
Don’t influence her. Don’t teach her.,btohqsg
Don’t advocate for her to act like that  though.,btohqsg
Doesn’t mean that you should encourage it. Or  even normalise it. We should protect preserving their innocence as far as possible.,btohqsg
pocoyo identifies a bad word from kuro !,btohqsg
yea  it's right when uni students have their long break too,btohqsg
iw buy ipad but some Roblox kid aka,btohqsg
kinda like being in the trenches of pri  o and a level students mixed with uni masters and phd and even adults,btohqsg
also how old are you pocoyo,btohqsg
but person behind pocoyo maybe 16,btohqsg
too young to swear but old enough to buy an ipad,btohqsg
i thought pocoyo would be like,btohqsg
see if the acceleration due to gravity is really 9.8m/s²,btohqsg
pocoyo the secondwhy not just steal it back,btohqsg
why do you want a new one,btohqsg
data cleaning when theres only 1 set of data and no pre and post descriptive text is so satisfying jeesos,btohqsg
esp aft cleaning 4 sets of hella dirty data,btohqsg
This is why I haven’t upgraded from my iPad Air 2 since 2015.,btohqsg
