a = str('EJC')b = str('ACJC')While len(a) < len(b):print(a),btohqsg
I'll take that as a yes,btohqsg
I suppose ejc campus is nicer,btohqsg
"Any RI elites want to share how they are ""pablic aenimee numba wan""https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/h0ric8/rant_stop/",btohqsg
"""Hey dude it's ITE LUL""""Yeah thankful I studied hard never go ITE""vs.""Hey dude it's RI LUL""""WTF I FEEL SO ATTACKED""#itsnotokifigetattacked",btohqsg
There is some truth to this though,btohqsg
Which is why some RI people don’t like to say they’re from RI,btohqsg
And how is this a bad thing,btohqsg
It sucks to not be able to be proud of your skool in public,btohqsg
Wat would life be like if I couldn’t shill for ACJC at every opportunity,btohqsg
How not to be proud? 3 words bro Lee Kuan Yew,btohqsg
Which will have answers resolving all these conundrums!!!!!!!!!!!!!,btohqsg
A lot of minister come from RI,btohqsg
If only come from more humble backgrounds sia,btohqsg
You can both be from a humble background and be from RI,btohqsg
CCS is from a single parent household and grew up in a three room flat,btohqsg
I wonder if they have a political inner circle in RI,btohqsg
Could u pm me a link,btohqsg
No matter where you are  whether JC  poly or back alley  if you can find friends and people that you trust and bring them together for a common goal  you can do something big:),btohqsg
"I'm not from RI but surely RI is not just some magic place where ideas float into people's heads like ""this is the politics place"" haha",btohqsg
Not just politics  anything else... just my random night time epiphany that you don't have to be somewhere else in order to do what you want,btohqsg
I guess they got the psc  SAF or spf scholarship to climb the political ladder,btohqsg
"Haha ok lah  granted... some professions are just more ""exclusive"" because of all the barriers to entry",btohqsg
Like scholarships and inside circle stuff with ministers,btohqsg
how does one effectively do that,btohqsg
My GP tutor was once nominated as an NMP... it was a very arbitrary process tbh they just picked him and told him to go for some secret interview,btohqsg
umm... be a nice person who can stand on your own and be enthusiastic about whatever you're doing  look for people in the right places (subreddits) and naturally you get some? Hahah,btohqsg
Said GP tutor is not just any ah mao ah kow haha but yeah  the process is really like that,btohqsg
haha i have like 2 close friends whom i consider actually real and i alr consider myself lucky,btohqsg
how to even get a group of that,btohqsg
"Tbh I nvr liked the idea of a ""best friend""",btohqsg
I don't think I can teach life skills by telegram HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
I don't really care for best friends and being overly clingy  I'm happier when I know that all the people I surround myself with are genuine folks who I can depend on and who will count on me when they need it,btohqsg
I guess that's the best description I can come up with haha,btohqsg
thats why i know u cant have more than 5 genuine friends at a time,btohqsg
true that there are alot of snakes out there,btohqsg
but I'm guessing that most people don't actually set out to be snakes to everyone they meet haha,btohqsg
if they do  guess I'm one naive child,btohqsg
"if only relationships could be explained by diagrams:"")",btohqsg
it just that its quite impossible to keep depth of friendship for many people at a time,btohqsg
we only have 24 hours in a day and responsibilities to handle,btohqsg
"but basically my point is... if you're interested in things like arts or politics or whatever ""inacessible"" ""elite"" career  and you think that only if you to go this JC or this uni then you can dare to think of it",btohqsg
to keep that many friends you'd have to dedicate your entire life to it,btohqsg
Know that there are probably 20 other people in your cohort who thinks the same way,btohqsg
I have batchmates in law sch,btohqsg
And my jc wasnt considered good,btohqsg
I turned down comp law also,btohqsg
My jc not proven yet  must wait for us to hit like 5 year track record then say,btohqsg
We dont even have any working alumni,btohqsg
All our grads still in y2 uni or NS,btohqsg
