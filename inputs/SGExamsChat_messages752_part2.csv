If you want to run in y3 you must first be an intern in y2Being an intern look at your gpa and conduct and needs interview. And that is only to be an intern. Alot of SC interns dont even run for elections in Y3. If you want to run in y3   you must have been an intern and have more interviews . And you may not even get voted in in y3.In y5 its only interview and running,btohqsg
Got politics with batchmates then got politics with ur junios,btohqsg
But I'll do it again la teehee,btohqsg

Campaigning for sc is crazy bruh,btohqsg

Also during my batch when we were campaigning it was the height of like feminism or smth,btohqsg
Every girl was super openly against guys,btohqsg
but 4 ppl got rejected after sc interviews (my friend in sc told me)2 ppl who are siaolang since y1 so its kinda understandable and 2 JAEs,btohqsg

"Like thr were alot of people who were like ""I'll vote XX cuz she's a girl and we don't need guys in leadership positions""",btohqsg
bro you been in sch for like 2 months got ppl shittalking you alr 💀💀😬,btohqsg
Cuz my friend who was like head prefect in my sch didn't get council cuz my batch girls didn't want too many guys in council,btohqsg
The only harder thing I can see is that scdf has mc restriction,btohqsg
