Parts n labour e not cheap,btohqsg
And there a lots of trolls. They cannot afford luxury cars but are asking questions to waste time,btohqsg
You yourself knows best what you can afford,btohqsg
Can afford mthly is one thing,btohqsg
The sudden break down cost is anothwr,btohqsg
Especially the bhp above 450 😂,btohqsg
I wonder where he went 🤣,btohqsg
And add some unkown liquid in a plastic container w tubes dunno go where,btohqsg
Invest in 2 fire extinguisher also needed,btohqsg
Wah E60 M5 only $130k ah..,btohqsg
I think don’t bah… maybe better to go with a car that will likely give you less maintenance burden? Unless you have owned several cars before and are mentally prepared to go through some efforts to clean up the car? Not saying it’s a bad car at all but performance cars just need a bit more preventive maintenance and care etc…,btohqsg
Vios is Yaris cross sedan version,btohqsg
Ya  performance car is a different beast on its own. I think for first time buyer should consider getting 'normal' car first before going for it,btohqsg
U want u dont get such a high maintenance car. Get a semi perf car,btohqsg
I will not touch it w a 5 foot pole,btohqsg
Dexteron one hand  u’re only young and foolish once  at least u can say U had it once  on the other hand  if you’re really pragmatic  thn the decision is pretty straightforward.Financial decisions not withstanding,btohqsg
It’s like owning a yacht. Buying one isn’t that expensive  but the parking fees and maintenance will really get that mentally and financially unprepared.,btohqsg
Atmost bankrupt start from 0 again,btohqsg
These kind of cars like prostitutes,btohqsg
See who the u lucky one. To kana,btohqsg
No win one in Singapore. End of that journey  one can be penniless while other more financially astute friends would have spent that time accumulating a nice bank and investment account. Life choices.,btohqsg
Only 3 outcome.1) sell at a loss2) scrap n get back whatever's left at a loss3) drive till ur pocket big hole,btohqsg
Plus this M5  i think u want loan also very difficult,btohqsg
Insurance wise sure give u figure frm the moon,btohqsg
Cars like this.. someone told me mainly attract other hot blooded .. males. 😁 So really depends on one’s reason for buying these cars.,btohqsg
Coe car alr still sell so high,btohqsg
And if you don’t know workshops and parts suppliers well  prepare to be possibly  very possibly chopped wlwkwkwkwkkwkwkwwk,btohqsg
Must think from young person perspective  if not now  then when?,btohqsg
Next time even got money  got other commitment already,btohqsg
No family no kid  can risk to buy this M5,btohqsg
Imagine car spoil need 5k. Kid go hospital need 5k. Choose 1,btohqsg
Singapore isn’t a place where one wakes up one day and decides “I think it is time to save up to buy a house” and it happens the next day one.,btohqsg
Find something else less financially damaging to YOLO bah,btohqsg
If one has to full or majority loan to buy a performance car  the answer is pretty clear whether or not to buy.,btohqsg

Hi all  can I check if anybody knows the engine oil used here decent enough for Korean car?Also  if oil filter is OEM acceptable?This one is found in my GrabHitch app,btohqsg
My minor servicing is due soon  so I wondering if this can fit the bill. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance 🙏🏼 👍🏼,btohqsg
Any brand of EO is decent enough,btohqsg
noted that it does not have the tyre rotation/wheel balancing which workshops have included in the minor servicing  nor the topping of fluid (unsure of this is only for major),btohqsg
Bro engine Oil is see ur vehicle book and see what is the recommended oil specifications,btohqsg
Ya that’s the good thing sbout buying “basic” jap or korea car,btohqsg
As long engine oil can liao,btohqsg
That one including in basic servicing meh,btohqsg
the former have but latter I think don't have (probably mixed up with my last major servicing),btohqsg
Usually my ws will help check check then top up if can,btohqsg
Honestly for SG environment 5W30/5W40 and OEM oil filter can Liao  if you service regularly and on time,btohqsg
Nope  i did a check on my manual.. not all can😂😂 then i change to the specific type,btohqsg
Liqui moly top tec 4200 now,btohqsg
Die die must use LM meh,btohqsg
I using the VW XXX XXX as a guide,btohqsg
Ya Stamford tyres included it in their minor package,btohqsg
Some of them no oil also can keep going,btohqsg
I think the manual wouldn't say the brand,btohqsg
Yah grade I follow manual  brand is trial and error,btohqsg
Some car manufacturers do suggest a brand but it's not a die die must use thing,btohqsg
And grades also got 1 or 2 options at times,btohqsg
If the manual is very general and not region specific,btohqsg
Cause they're a tyre shop so very easy for them,btohqsg
Most other workshops don't actually do tyre stuff,btohqsg
Rotation is not too hard but for balancing need the machine which tyre shops have but not general workshops,btohqsg
Some workshop recommend 30 when still new. But change to 40 when car gets older,btohqsg
But in general for Sg  w20 for hybrid  w30 for turbo n w40 for normal,btohqsg
I personally dont like but ppl change thicker cus piston rings do wear out..,btohqsg
Any workshop charge 20-30 dollars for oil change ? Bring own engine oil and filter.,btohqsg
If leak  buy oil filter wrench and diy,btohqsg

if that is the case  before u buy  u alr bring down the price to make sure u got enuf to cover gb overhaul,btohqsg
Last time I go the agent says their price fix  at most they can do is change the tyre give more servicing package etc,btohqsg
some dealers is really price fixed  but dont gimme the stuff that im alr gna have  gimme extra,btohqsg
