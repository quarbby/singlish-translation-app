what about those with unlimited cashback like amex absolute cashback?,btohqsg
Hahahahhaa but itâ€™s still awarded right? Do you hear what you are saying?,btohqsg
i think he think A say B type C ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Bro Melvyn ask me to share my opinion,btohqsg
U really cant read the real meaning Melvyn mean ah,btohqsg
He ask you share opinion on why uob kf is better than ppv but you started on a whole new topic on banks worry you canâ€™t pay,btohqsg
I say on the long run is better to use uob kris flyer...,btohqsg
Bank give u a credit limit  that is what is restricting the default risk  not the reward cap,btohqsg
Can you explain why? Iâ€™m very interested in knowing more,btohqsg
Because you are certain likely to use transport and also dining,btohqsg
Since hsbc nerb fast food. I believe uob kris flyer can use on that,btohqsg
I agree with what chris say.. you need to make it upsize to 10 $ a meal so that you will gain using preferred visa card....,btohqsg
you know what   it doesnt matter as long as you are happy ðŸ˜Š ðŸŒˆ,btohqsg
Ohhhh so if my meal not 10$ I cannot use ppv? Why ah?,btohqsg
you all wrong ... best credit card is crmc,btohqsg
I also feel the same as chris.... always have to think to spend 5 and above so to earn that rewards.... in the long run.. I feel uob kris flyer is more beneficial,btohqsg
Thank you for your wise advice. Should I use fairprice app with HSBC Revo for kopitiam dining? The food quite slow de.,btohqsg
But jialat leh  max only 1k. If I spend 3k on LV bag I cannot pay then bank no give me bonus miles,btohqsg
Which kopitiam you go? Mine very fast so I think my kopitiam considered fast food,btohqsg
Used to be can do it with ocbc rewards card... no more the case,btohqsg
Uob Krisflyer also in $5 Dollar spending block so i dont know what u are talking about to be honest,btohqsg
i will split my spending for my LV bag   1k crmc   1k hsbc   1k uob   1k ppv SETTLE then i wont be in debt,btohqsg
My kopitiam take about half an hour to serve wor. Think considered slow food... Need to know from@AdrainHoaif HSBC Revo okay for dining,btohqsg
It is more beneficial if you were to put dining  transport for this card... and also make sure to spend 800 on SQ  kris shop or Scoot per year,btohqsg
You will get the 3 miles for it. And also uob kris flyer is direct transfer miles to Sq kris flyer... so don't need worry about ophan points,btohqsg
I earn 4mpd compare to 3mpd and need to complete 800 spend per year. Maybe u talkinh about cap coz u dont hold alot of card. I got tons of card to spilt to earn max 4mpd,btohqsg
Actually side track  is it worth to use miles card as a cashback card? Like example since revo or crmc is more like a points systems that I can offset my bills. Or would I be better off using a cashback card,btohqsg
This one I not sure. Kopitiam card I put to uob preferred platinum visa,btohqsg
Why not your favourite UOB Kris Flyer?,btohqsg
during march there was a points to cashback conversion promotion  if u want cashback can wait till cashback conversion promotion and see whats the ratei think 3.8% from 2.5%,btohqsg
I cancel uob kris flyer previously.. they too slow to give bonus miles,btohqsg
But what if you can't pay $3k LV bag and don't get any miles?,btohqsg
"Iirc  Revo is 2.5pc and crmc is 2.2ish pc. I would think you're better off using ""specialised"" cashback cards like Citi Cashback (6pc on dining  grocery  8pc on transport) or Evol  but you'd have to look at your spending patterns of course",btohqsg
Yeaa Iâ€™m holding my points now  but the promotion is not confirmed one right? Like itâ€™s not a quarterly or annually thing hor?,btohqsg
Lol i know no what if for myself haha  i got maybe 40 to 50 card for 2 player,btohqsg
i would wait ba   since points expiry after 37 months. Should have such promos sooner or later,btohqsg
Seriously I won't pay more than 1100 for a LV bag because it breaks the bonus cap for citi rewards,btohqsg
I donâ€™t have a fixed spending so I canâ€™t really do those that require min spend.  Currently using revo for cashback instead but since the nerf  my usual spending was affected,btohqsg
But what if got orphan miles,btohqsg
let it expire better   such points no use anyway since cannot orphan,btohqsg
go atas shop do this very lao kui...,btohqsg
Thinking to adopt some orphan miles so they not lonely,btohqsg
lol I go dior  the sales assistant tellMe itâ€™s commonLao Kui is old mindset liao.,btohqsg
I think can bargain with them. Maybe 3k bag become 1.1k. Just tell them your max cap for bonus miles only 1.1k,btohqsg
The more the rich is rich is because the more they particular with money,btohqsg
it won't be the best pseudo-cashback card you have  pretty average.but good news is the lack of minimum spending,btohqsg
No such thing as lao kui,btohqsg
U got to do what other wont do so u get what other dont get,btohqsg
Ohhh coz Iâ€™m seeing like other cashback cards is around 1.6-2% but revo is around 2.5. So it doesnâ€™t seem like a bad choice for now but finding alternative for like third party travel and supermarket,btohqsg
Trust me  my face is thick enough to ask sales to spilt bill for me into different card or even cross month if the item is not urgent,btohqsg
