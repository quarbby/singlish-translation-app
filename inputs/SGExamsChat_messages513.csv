hi guys  is poly stress ? someone told me it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ i am planning to eae and dsa at the same time,btohqsg
Depends on how hard u willing to work hard and ur end goal.,btohqsg
Jst get into local uni or go into med,btohqsg
Also what jc u looking at,btohqsg
This one unfortunately no other options,btohqsg
No offense to any sajc kids,btohqsg
Ri and nyjc q big gulf frm sajc worh,btohqsg
But i suspect ur goal of being a doctor might change in the next few yrs,btohqsg
If uw go doctor go nursing btr,btohqsg
poly to med works too what no meh,btohqsg
So we take it as a non factor,btohqsg
alot of jc ppl ik got rejected,btohqsg
and q a few poly accepted,btohqsg
Because the applicant pool is larger,btohqsg
maybe its just my acquaintance pool bias,btohqsg
The highest record for acceptance to med is 18,btohqsg
Also here's a fun tidbit pharm sci although it's a relevant diploma I don't think a single person has entered local med yet from Pharm sci,btohqsg
RP had 1 student went into med on average year on year,btohqsg
tp mbt valedictorian cgpa 3.99 nus med and ntu med,btohqsg
No please don't these Diplomas are relevant but they really aren't training you to be a doctor at all there is a lot of content,btohqsg
Exactly I talking about pharm which 0 ppl have gone into local med,btohqsg
Cuz u think Abt it pharm u have to put in twice the effort if uw go med and I nvr hear b4 pharm student gg meds..,btohqsg
if im not wrong there is 1 from tp phs who got into ntu med,btohqsg
i like how all the poly kids js,btohqsg
That's why I say go nursing...,btohqsg
Cuz I have seen far too many ppl wanna be doctor in my time in SAS,btohqsg
It's 1 on average every 2 years that kind,btohqsg
i alr know multiple from nursing to med,btohqsg
ik a lot of nursing ppl end up in med tho,btohqsg
i dont hate that module its mostly my teammates fr,btohqsg
but i do have an issue with the tech ones  like c110 and c227 (i have no interest in IT shit),btohqsg
I mean even so it's small la,btohqsg
More pursuing nursing and medical degrees at Singapore universities - TODAYhttps://www.todayonline.com/singapore/more-pursuing-nursing-and-medical-degrees-singapore-universities,btohqsg
I never said nursing cannot what got ppl go in,btohqsg
U can always go nursing then go up,btohqsg
i think is last time nursing v few,btohqsg
My point is the only diplomas that had ppl go into local med is biomed type and nursing,btohqsg
That's why I said go nursing dont go pharm sci,btohqsg
And that's why I say don't even choose Diploma for med,btohqsg
Most nursing students when they apply do that,btohqsg
So first choice med then second choice nursing,btohqsg
The thing about nursing is that it rlly is hell,btohqsg
Like to study that as a Nitec or Diploma the work ethic needed is like..,btohqsg
Honestly most things are its just how well u are compensated for going thru hell,btohqsg
But u get EXTREMELY good skipping mods,btohqsg
Like thats y i feel med ppl underpaid,btohqsg
They go thru extra hell but makes 10k oni as GP,btohqsg
Specialist oni rch in 40s then start raking in decent pay,btohqsg
Waa not bad tho Nitec to Poly confirm 3.9 pointer,btohqsg
If not go NTUC buy the disposable one,btohqsg
Or if u near home then go home,btohqsg
Don't mean to sexist but for nursing it rlly is true,btohqsg
Or u take away the underwear and go commando below,btohqsg
The one that he * went,btohqsg
I mean like just look at the stats can liao a lot of ppl say eh why woman but then it's just like that,btohqsg
Y all the poly ppl popping out now leh,btohqsg
To tell the Os and ITE students and crush their dreams,btohqsg
Either ways the highest acceptance is still in terms of sheer numbers countable in 1 hand,btohqsg
Cmon la we talking about 4 vs 6 it really is nothing to boast also,btohqsg
And got 1 of em errr *cough* we all know la that 1,btohqsg
It's the same reason why there is so many gawd damn requirements for med also what,btohqsg
BOM SAS BOM SAS BOM SAS,btohqsg
For local med that has always been the case lol,btohqsg
I can neither confirm nor deny,btohqsg
And if u gnna look at jc by tiers,btohqsg
Not rlly la Australia they recognise,btohqsg
It's just UK they ignore also,btohqsg
Top 5 gnna makan more than half of that 200,btohqsg
Huh? Bruh my Program Chair said yes,btohqsg
They phrasing out but now still got mbbs,btohqsg
Anyways gotta follow the SMC list too,btohqsg
I think it's 3 unis thay are accept only for AUS anyways,btohqsg
OR like UC BERKLEY OR SMTH,btohqsg
Ok but tbf singapore is also the same asshole they don't accept JD from like Darthmouth too,btohqsg
Or JD from brown For that matter,btohqsg
Was just using it to make a point I change it to brown now la,btohqsg
But the idea still stands basically,btohqsg
I think MIT doesn't have MD too  Harvard probably does,btohqsg
but I get the point yeah,btohqsg
anyone know how to book apptment at kkh.. is it need submit req form then they‚Äôll get back to u the following day,btohqsg
Yeah med for the US is a postgraduate thing,btohqsg
Either that or u go poly clinic get a referral,btohqsg
They help book for you and the slots are better,btohqsg
u think calling them makes any difference or no,btohqsg
It makes a difference only if u are able to get to the correct routing number,btohqsg
Bro wrote an entire essay on it,btohqsg
whether jc or poly need to perfect score so both ways also not easy,btohqsg
But either ways it better to get from polyclinic cuz it will be considered a doctor referral,btohqsg
U book yourself its considered self referral and the line is longer,btohqsg
just that one is cumulative but less stressful as lesser content to memorise.. but the other is built up for the next 2 years and tested in one exam,btohqsg
90 RP easier to achieve that 4.0 especially in like Biomed,btohqsg
choose which one u work best with lo,btohqsg
JC is looked upon more favourably in Singapore,btohqsg
there‚Äôs a chance u flunk one exam and ur gpa down. but there‚Äôs also a chance u flunk one exam and u waste 2 years in jc,btohqsg
how to apply overseas with poly gpa i see nothing but one para regarding singapore gpa,btohqsg
Yep at the end of the day the one with the largest wallet wins,btohqsg
See lor y u go poly,btohqsg
someone can educate me how to apply kamxia,btohqsg

my parents want me go overseas but i rather js stay singapore and psb myself or smt,btohqsg
Lanjiao u go AUS or US also damn expensive,btohqsg

The Tristar was never made in large enough numbers,btohqsg
Lockheed lost a lot of money developing that,btohqsg
The plane that changed military aviation,btohqsg
So they decided to go back to the safe zone and manufacturing bombs and bomber planes,btohqsg

HAHAHHA you've never seen all boeing planes icic,btohqsg

the fat fuk boi ruling the skies,btohqsg
same for me  but I fly to heaven,btohqsg
then I get shut off by the gates,btohqsg
This one is the most revolutionary plane,btohqsg
DC-3 without it we all would be speaking German Russian or Japanese,btohqsg
Remember infantry wins battle supply wins wars,btohqsg
The fact it was a old model makes it even more intresting,btohqsg

The max is an engineering marvell tho,btohqsg

it‚Äôs not rly a disaster tho,btohqsg
Not really sg but a hijacking‚Äôs happened to a MAS flight 10 yrs before,btohqsg
Oh yea there was also that 9/11 sg airlines bomb threat,btohqsg
Exactly u a boeing bitch now?,btohqsg
I like guys with good length and nice girth,btohqsg
this was the reason why sq did not have a specially painted aircraft for many years thereafter,btohqsg
No I felt I‚Äôm not on drugs I felt there was one that wasn‚Äôt a disaster,btohqsg
Then u would like the 787 what,btohqsg
I guess the management was v superstitious,btohqsg
It crashed just shy of sg in johor,btohqsg
ya. they had two of those. the other one gt repainted bck quickly,btohqsg
y‚Äôall can‚Äôt lie aloha air disaster was one hella good story,btohqsg
I just realised we forgotten to talk about the biggest bitch of em all,btohqsg
ig the mgmt was v superstitious,btohqsg
This incident was also terrible because of what happened that yr,btohqsg
wah isn‚Äôt this one also q similar to the Japan airline,btohqsg
the one that crash into the mountains,btohqsg
American Airlines flight 587 took off from nyc and crashed just a few mins later  reason‚Ä¶.constant feathering of the rudder caused the wing to fall off,btohqsg
The recent china airlines one also scary sia,btohqsg
A near 90 degree turn to the ground like wtf,btohqsg
The one that can make it fron London to new york shorter than watching the titanic,btohqsg

A330 is short asf compared to 747 isn't it,btohqsg
Either new york to Singapore or smth else ridiculous,btohqsg
Tbh we say that la but back when the USSR was a thing..,btohqsg
Cuz the ETOPS rating for that is insane,btohqsg
For flight duration we had a record,btohqsg
bro i thought he asked for longest plane,btohqsg
my alter ego came and left üò≠,btohqsg
But tbh the longest should also be a cargo plane,btohqsg
yea gt quite a few u.s flights using that : Seattle   LA   SF   Newark,btohqsg
& a solo Canadian route to Vancouver,btohqsg
First aircraft to receive a ETOPS 370 rating lol,btohqsg
It can fly anywhere around the world,btohqsg
that's -500SIA did not order -600 series for A340,btohqsg
The modest and gradual appreciation stance of the Singapore Dollar in relation to a Basket of other Currencies,btohqsg
OH NO I COMMITTED A CRIME WHILE NOT HAVING A LICENSE OMGOMG,btohqsg
