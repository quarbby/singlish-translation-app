i completely forgot youâ€™re still here wtf,btohqsg
which subjectâ€™s distinction is the most powerful may I ask,btohqsg
like would you rather get A in h2 math or h1 gp,btohqsg
no real answer. depends what uni course you wanna go to,btohqsg
if your heuristic is what opens the most doors then the answer would be pcm/bcm,btohqsg
like if you could only choose to get A for one subject which one would it be,btohqsg
math has the highest distinction rate,btohqsg
Math because an A for h1 gp isn't helping me secure uni admissions,btohqsg
Now FASS and Sciences combined rite,btohqsg
no one's gonna look at your A lvl cert and commend you for getting an A in an obscure subject,btohqsg
