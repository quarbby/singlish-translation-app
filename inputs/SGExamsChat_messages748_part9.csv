Idk for France lmao but for us the raise is done and mainly beneficial to those with CPF,btohqsg
It allows for more interest gained from social security contributions into CPF.,btohqsg
Yea any policy that gives the people more option to earn money before they kick the bucket is bound to be good for the people. But It just looks good on he surface,btohqsg
doesnt it mean ppl have to work longer to retire tho?,btohqsg
Not if their CPF has the money. The raise means those who are broke can continue to work at higher contribution rates,btohqsg
I don't know much about policy making but increasing the retirement age indeed increases the amt people could earn but also give companies one more reason to stagnate their employees,btohqsg
For France it's literally a pension system which we don't do.,btohqsg
Ours is a mix of the freedom of a Roth IRA combined with the rigidity and guarantees of a Pension system.,btohqsg
Why would any same company want to increasing the pay of a older person in a company? Cognitively they are less capable,btohqsg
And also means they get higher matches for cpf contributions,btohqsg
They have that option but will they leave if they get mistreated? Especially cause they are old. That is my thought process,btohqsg
Oh boi this is about to get interesting,btohqsg
Aint the whole point of a age retirement increase is to give people the option to live longer with better conditions..unless I'm missing the point of a age retirement increase,btohqsg
Hello. I forgot who u are specifically but i rmb u somehow,btohqsg
