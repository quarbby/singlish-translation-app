i have seen friends install camera below the car to watch the exhaust,btohqsg
for me my camera just points down at the boot,btohqsg
my bumper pass the curb i stop,btohqsg
because my car with hks exhaust is known to kena parking curbs,btohqsg
this one got freak accidents happened before,btohqsg
Cos headunit outputs the reverse cam,btohqsg
But isnt ur door covering ur face,btohqsg
mean just nice another car or lorry like that reverse fast and next to u ah ??,btohqsg
hard to say how these people die from the accidents la,btohqsg
Put a can drink (simulate the wheel stop / kerb) and reverse at an empty car park. Then gauge the lines on the reverse cam to see if the lines touch the can  is there still room to reverse ? If there is  you can keep going back and fourth till you find a sweet spot. For my car  once the bottom of the screen touches the kerb  i can further reverse in about 1cm on the screen. It will be just nice leaving a 5cm gap between the exhaust and kerb outside,btohqsg
is the normal reverse camera just mounted under the car,btohqsg
but i thought it was stupid la,btohqsg
I cant say i havent wished i could see where my pipes were relative to a kerb,btohqsg
