Got samurai code of honour decal anotüòÇ,btohqsg
in fact nothing complicated. basically be courteous and respect each other and the road rules.,btohqsg
these are basics that are lacking in singapore driving culture,btohqsg
It mostly talks about road hogging,btohqsg
Which I definitely agree is a huge problem in sg,btohqsg
This is the only country i drive in where people hog the overtaking lane consistently,btohqsg
Buay zi dong is the singapore way,btohqsg
i think those that get this decal will be those that don't hog. those that do  dont know or wont admit.,btohqsg
it's a good intention and i hope it works as a reminder for people,btohqsg
maybe if highway reduce to 2 lanes  everyone will understand the importance of not hogging.,btohqsg
