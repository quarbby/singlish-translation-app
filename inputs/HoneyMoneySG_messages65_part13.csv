Hi I have a question. I applied through singsaver for credit card and there's this reward pic 1 and the bank it self has a 500 cashback for 599 spend within 30 days. If I claim the singsaver reward  does it void the bank's reward as well?,btohqsg
If i apply now  will i be in time to get this promo of cash $500?,btohqsg
So i use this link to apply?https://hmsg.link/scofficial,btohqsg
The $500 cashback only applies to the simply cash card?,btohqsg
Thanks for your analysis. I think this investment is rather risky even though guaranteed by Maxi-Cash doesn't mean much as compared to credit of a triple A rated government bond,btohqsg
Yes  till 21 sep.Only simplycash thru the link,btohqsg

Ya you wun get 4mpd until the nxt billing cycle,btohqsg
"Thank you. I think it makes sense to ""save"" the expenses for the Amaze card if I do know I am travelling that month.",btohqsg
