Oh it works? I thought trazora said cannot add prepaid cards,btohqsg
Oh. Link to other prepaid cards. I think possible la. GPMC cannot use Revolut (MC version) or EZ-Link digital MC lor,btohqsg
Can link Revolut virtual disposable MC or EZ-Link wallet MC to Instarem and remove the other card. EZ-Link wallet will be better since they decline all payments made via Amaze,btohqsg
Only whitelist like mcd. Kfc. Lots of other fast food not applicable.,btohqsg
This is a brilliant idea ðŸ’¡ especially the link to EZ-Link Wallet thing,btohqsg

Just curious  not all vouchers qualifies for the cimb promotion?,btohqsg
Hey all! New here haha. Don't mind me  will lurk for a while,btohqsg
Just tried. Update: can't link GPMC with Amaze. I don't have the Revolut temp card or EZ link wallet but those may be worth a try...,btohqsg
Guessing here but I feel like Amaze will override CRMC's overseas transaction disabled as citi treats amaze overseas transactions as local online spend...,btohqsg

Is it standard card or metal?,btohqsg

For trust bank account  in the app if you are union member  would it show 2.5% even after having done 5 transactions? Or app only shows 2% regardless of union membership?,btohqsg
Hello morning!For the HSBC EGA bonus interest  it makes sense to top up only 1st of every month? Wonâ€™t make sense to top up now as itâ€™s near the end of the month to get the most interest? Thanks!,btohqsg

Not sure if I mentioned this before but Trust Bank is having a promo where u can get $2 rebate for paying via ShopBack QR charged to your Trust Bank card. Thats $2/5x100%= 40% discount.Can claim up to 4 times per Trust Bank customer. Claim your coupons in the Trust Bank app under Rewards. U need to redeem manually each time before u pay via ShopBack QR. Make sure to double check during checkout that your default card is the Trust Bank card. I had to manually select it again even though I set it as default payment card earlier.Promo ends 31 Jan 2023.,btohqsg
