Didn’t Chris say it’s excluded? What do you mean by it’s still fine?,btohqsg
Impossible  the app is not even available,btohqsg
I mean he says excluded is for macdonald and other fast food  also jolibee. I say fine means can be use for hawkers.,btohqsg
You mean you delete xnap apps from your phone ?,btohqsg
“XNAP mcc is 5814” which is excluded,btohqsg
5814 is for fast food .. right bro. ?,btohqsg
When you scan xnap QR code  it gives you internal server error. So the lady is probably not even using xnap,btohqsg
I read at sethisfy. It says 5814 is nerfy   also mention fast food,btohqsg
Wah like that better use uob preferred visa to eat at ya kun better..  spend a bit more,btohqsg
Fast food is not literally fast food like your mcd or what. It depends on the mcc code “XNAP transactions code asMCC 5814 Fast Food Restaurants”,btohqsg
This term really confusing... thanks bro for pointing out...,btohqsg
Sam. So means even xnap can be used. If pair with hsbc revolution.  Eat at hawker. You won't get 4 miles ?,btohqsg
How is it confusing? HSBC revo goes by mcc whitelist  just based it on the mcc  doesn’t matter what you eat. Learn how to read  even Chris say it’s excluded,btohqsg
lol which part of excluded you don’t understand,btohqsg
Because I thought mcc 5814 is for fast food,btohqsg
Yes. It matters. Because if 5814 is only for fast food. Xnap if is still OK. Can still be use to earn 4 miles,btohqsg
Worse to worse. Use another option. Amex pay.,btohqsg
The conclusion is:- You can't use XNAP right now (so don't even talk about HSBC Revolution here)  and- HSBC Revolution doesnt award 4mpd on Fast Food MCC 5814,btohqsg
You may want to understand what is mcc code first n also understand which merchants are under 5814.MCD  yakun  Aston  Ajisen Ramen  Kopitiam  KFC  Xnap  Starbucks…… are all using mcc code 5814 for its credit card transactions.,btohqsg
Use UOB Evol CC to renew road tax  qualifies the $250 online purchase?,btohqsg
Nerf q...been using uob lady cc to pay recurring insurance premium to hit 500 spend. As it is gg to end and wonder how i can use the card to hit 500 spend instead .,btohqsg
Just use as normal for other expenses? What category did you select for lady?,btohqsg
is XNAP app gone for good?,btohqsg
oh no  is there a nerf for this,btohqsg
Is it advisable to use Citi rewards card pair with Amaze card to book SQ tickets to Japan?The Citi rewards point likely won’t apply for air tickets but do it get the instapoints and the good fx rate?,btohqsg
Only uob one card/debit take recurring insurance as spending for uob one acct. Does uob lady count as well?,btohqsg
Tks all for my q. I've nvr use this card b4 for other exps. Tried once last mth for mrt topup but seemed like not added to my 500 spend. Wonder for food or groceries count. As m not working so not much i could spend for 500.,btohqsg
the nerf u are saying is using insurance premium as 500 spending for uob one account?,btohqsg
Just happen to open uob one when i wanted to do a fd back then. Was then told i could earn higher int rate for it making 500spend + salary or 3 giro.,btohqsg
What do you mean by going to end?,btohqsg
My premium for insurance gg to end soon so no more 500spend,btohqsg
Instapoints only for foreign transactions. You booking your flights in sgd?,btohqsg
Cos the premium will end soon n if no spend 500 i wont be able to earn good interest for amt in uob1 acct,btohqsg
That’s not the definition of nerf.,btohqsg
Oh...i thot nerf means silly q...sorry yah,btohqsg
Depends on your spending anyways  you can pay for your family members insurance through your card and have them pay you. Or buy supermarket vouchers to make up the shortfall,btohqsg
On SQ website it’s allowed to select payment by jpn yen or sgd.Their sgd rate sux so I figure better use amaze card to pay by jpn yen.,btohqsg
You are better off using another general spend master card + Amaze  at least still can get 1.x mpd.,btohqsg
Imo  I don’t think it’s worth just to get the instapoints only since Citi rewards exclude airlines related. And you have to calculate the fx spread of using amaze to see if it’s actually cheaper than paying in sgd directly,btohqsg
Hi all Anyone use any miles card to pay for petrol?,btohqsg
Cuz I only have one master card haha.,btohqsg
is there any way to check my citi rewards points expiry instead of calling the cust support?,btohqsg
what category is chosen for ur uob lady? If not sure can contact uob to enquire.,btohqsg
Should have. Search chat history using SPC  Shell  Esso shall be able to find some data points.,btohqsg

You mention that there is a better method but not mentioned in the video,btohqsg
He alrd say cannot share it publicly,btohqsg
Is it shared in the telegram community?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  happy Sunday. Would anyone know if the Citi SMRT card is able to earn 5% on Kris+?,btohqsg
