Q results are not out yet. No updates from the brickville chat either. Doubt it,btohqsg
even if results out the appointment wont be so soon,btohqsg
I always find the single applicants for bb brickville interesting. With the allocation  50/130 for 2r flexi  you have to be really really lucky to secure a unit when the application rate is 36.2. The faster waiting time of 24 months could be a trap. On the other hand this group of applicants didn't cancel still and change to jurong skyline on the last day. Thus resulting in higher chances for the skyline applicants,btohqsg
If hdb gives que numbers of up to 300% of supply  I think singles could have better chances than 1.7 rate. But whether the unapplied slots for the other categories go to singles or sbf I think we’ll only know when results out,btohqsg
Gonna be interesting to see a block with majority singles lol,btohqsg
Wah the application results for Oct launch is out??,btohqsg
Yes I received  their ask me go on 16 Dec,btohqsg
Means you got a queue to select flat unit?,btohqsg
