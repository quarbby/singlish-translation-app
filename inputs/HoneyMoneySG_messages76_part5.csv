Anyone know what is the best savings account to open for Citi Rewards card? Normal Citibank / Citi plus / Citi Gold?,btohqsg
Shouldn't you redeem immediately once FRS is into RA? Idea is fast in fast out for shielding right?,btohqsg
Can buy from fundsupermart  dollardex etc,btohqsg
It is only recently that T bill yield hovers around 4%.. with the upfront coupon   you will not be able to shield those coupons (maybe not that significant).. at the same time   going for non competitive bid runs the risk of low yield,btohqsg
Competitive bids at a sensible bid is best  for shielding purpose  3% should be able to get fully alloted,btohqsg
there is no need to open any account for citi rewards card,btohqsg
Hello! Can I check if I can get 4mpd if I use hsbc revolution visa in Malaysia?,btohqsg

Hi  if I use my amaze card (that is linked to my partners cc) and my passport to purchase an item while overseas in Japan  can I check which of the following are feasible options:1) Apply for tax refund to my amaze card (will there be problems with this as I’m not sure if amaze card allows fund transfer? Previously had some problems with getting refunds for hotel bookings)2) Apply for refund to the amaze linked cc which belongs to my partner (but the amaze card that I used to buy the item was under my name)3) Apply for tax refund to my own Revolut card/ my own cc (which is not the same as the amaze card or my partners cc that was used to buy the item)Many thanks in advance 🙏,btohqsg

it is best to opt for cash refund when doing tax refund at departmental store global tax refund  certain store will do the tax refund deduction from final bill on the spot in japan  like clothing (uniqlo  eu)  pharmacy and places like loft  just need to go to special counter and tell them tax free. do note that not all stores under same merchant will have tax free options.,btohqsg

oh forgot to mention  japanese very book by book  the card use must match your passport name  even if the card is using christian name but not in your passport they will ask alot  judging by this i think they will also be rigid when u request tax refund to a different card that is not use for the spending,btohqsg
