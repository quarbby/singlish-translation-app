Back then  when Hong Lai Huat first announced this  penny market was not as hot.Since many might have forgotten about this potential catalyst that is still hanging  and in the process  which could potentially trigger the counter to come alive in a big way based on the amount itself as compared to current market cap of only $21.7 mil.

And many retailers impatient   don’t want to buy up and wait for the long term,btohqsg
IMO   hong Lai at $0.040 and below 👇 is a sure win if can hold . But retailers want to immediately win . I think that’s the problem.Have started to collect back some to position for longer term and some for short term contra . Looks like the recovery is starting.I think this one eventually might get a low balled offer by the controlling shareholder / Ong family.My view. OSOD. Dyodd,btohqsg
Why $0.040 because this was last price Dato Ong last did a married deal .,btohqsg
For easy reference Hong Lai Huat Controlling Shareholder have been actively accumulating his company shares in recent years.- Married deals (March 23) - 4000 lots @ $0.066- Married deals (May 24)- 5000 lots @ $0.040- Series of Open market purchases - (2023) at approx $0.067 to $0.070 range (refer to link below)Source:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/F2XM5C7YWIH9LSKI/751311__eFORM1V2%20OBH.pdf,btohqsg

Hong Lai Huat monthly chart 📊 seems to suggest a Super bottomed out consolidation (green block)Judging from the way it have flushed and retraced since a high of $0.220 (during Covid penny rally time in Sept2020)  looks like they have consolidated well in the last approx six months.This month should be the first time the monthly candle closes out of this 4 years down trend red pressure line.Can start to watchlist  especially those who have buying power can look to position perhaps.DYODD,btohqsg
