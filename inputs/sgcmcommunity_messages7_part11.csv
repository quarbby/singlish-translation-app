Hi guys would like to ask why sometimes my kia cerato forte 2009 model will have this weird sound like blue sg cars from the engine bay especially when accelerate,btohqsg
No vibration sounds tho sounds more like a blue sg electric carðŸ˜…,btohqsg
My guess will be your radiator fan,btohqsg
Ahh but its sometimes tho.. like switch off engine and on back its okay already,btohqsg
It didn't happen just when you turn on Aircon right?,btohqsg
More like the sound will appear halfway during the drive,btohqsg
My best guess should be radiator fan. But take my guess as a pinch of salt as I aren't expert in this. Especially when my car has no radiator. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Ah alright! Thanks for the help tho,btohqsg
No use guessing go ws and take a look before things get worse,btohqsg
Do check your engine temps as well.,btohqsg
Everything seems fine tho engine temp.. fuel consumption all normal,btohqsg

Is this like a leasing contract?,btohqsg
i dont know  didnt contact them,btohqsg
if base on 10 years loan with the dp  u are paying like 200k for an avente,btohqsg
Some people dont realised cause mthly is comfortable to them just pay only to drive,btohqsg
true that... just pay and dont think.,btohqsg
but the issue with lease to own is that it gets fussy when it comes to decision that requires ownership approval i.e. like choosing of insurance provider/scheme and workshop if one gets into an accident,btohqsg
because technically one is leasing to own so the ownership is technically under a company and not the driver  per say.,btohqsg
lease to own dun need think about anything pay 1 amt and only care about 3 things1. Season Parking2. Cash CArd3. Petrol/EV ChargingThats all mostly,btohqsg
That's a good version of a lease to own scheme. The one that i previously kena also even requires the owner (me) to cover road tax and insurance premium.,btohqsg
Insurance should be tagged to company so NCD under them . Not too sure about this lease to own.,btohqsg
WTH? Last time GLA got lease to own. At $1 900/mth all covered LOL. But i think terms and condition wise. Hmmmmm,btohqsg
i know right.... that's a painful lesson. Hence  i would advise all to cautiously read through all the T&Cs before signing on the dotted line.,btohqsg
