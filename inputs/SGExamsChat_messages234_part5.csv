The longest wait is in the mind,btohqsg
Just enjoy and it will seem faster,btohqsg

Enjoy free food and monetary rewards for IPPT,btohqsg
Anybody received their uni application  news alr,btohqsg
Meanwhile supposedly 6.8 million ppl attended NUS e-open house this yr,btohqsg
That's more than the SG population,btohqsg
maybe international students? like from overseas,btohqsg
That means like millions of people overseas were interested in NUS,btohqsg
Hope u get the help u need,btohqsg
That's why it's insane to me,btohqsg
But maybe 11th on QS makes for a good advertisement,btohqsg
Looks like someone hit their KPI for promotion,btohqsg
May I know where you got the 6.8 million figure from??,btohqsg
is there season parking if u stay in ntu halls?,btohqsg
it's like only for certain zone carparks right,btohqsg
so is it even worth buying season parking,btohqsg
It's worth if you're gonna drive everyday. Not worth if hall imho coz you're already in campus..,btohqsg
The lessons are all concentrated on a few locations only  so the season parking in those areas are worth if you need to go campus everyday,btohqsg
To enter the IP from PSLE,btohqsg
is there an interview required? Or is it purely through PSLE,btohqsg
Some schools require interview and selection test,btohqsg
I think they look through your kindergarten results,btohqsg
Usually they are specialised schools like SST NUSH Sota,btohqsg
anyone taking H1/H2 cse can share resourcessss?,btohqsg
Heyhey anyone here know whats 剧本杀 ！ Know chinese well can pm me :)   Play game and bond with new people !,btohqsg
I'm just commenting so nobody will tag me later. Been too busy to keep up with China stuff and my CSE notes are mostly outdated at this point. Dont tag me HAHA. Skills I still can help but wait until May thanks.,btohqsg
my teacher doesnt provide enough resources TT,btohqsg
Tbh nobody can be worse than my ex-teacher,btohqsg
my teacher comes in late and start class 30 min after actual lesson time,btohqsg
It was so bad that I learnt even more from a less experienced CSE teacher  and the HOD of Humanities have to get the less-experienced CSE teacher to hold a crashcourse for our class like one week before the A levels  that bad.,btohqsg
same i even thought of asking my gp teacher to read my essays,btohqsg
because my cse teacher dont read up regularly on china affairs,btohqsg
Since J1 i alr wanted to rid us of the crappy teacher but my classmates were not riled up enough  only like last stretch of JC then tell HOD they give up hope on CSE  and I was like  y'all get angry with me earlier  we could've learnt more effectively and scored better haiz,btohqsg
Now only March   get angry now.,btohqsg
