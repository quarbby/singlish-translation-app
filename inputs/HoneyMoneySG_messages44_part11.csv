Hi Chris any tips on how to calculate intrinsic value of a stocks ?,btohqsg
Sorry can check what does points back mean? When we redeem will be 15% points lesser?,btohqsg

Visa also can use on sg bus?,btohqsg
You have to ask the shifu@Saitamawho,btohqsg
U redeem 100%  they give you back 15%,btohqsg
Yes  just add and activate it on the SimplyGo app,btohqsg
the calculation is easy  just take the free cash flow projection and discount at risk discount rate. The hard part is to come out with the free cash flows.. need to have an idea on what is the future growth rate and profit margin. Need to have good understanding of the business and competitive environment,btohqsg
Simplygo app? Not google wallet app?,btohqsg
I take out my card and tap on the reader...,btohqsg

My live agent just insisted that only 7 transactions were posted  even after I screenshotted my whole mnth's worth of usage from the TL SimplyGo app,btohqsg

What abt HSBC A > external joint A account > joint HSBC A/B?,btohqsg
System wise passes the check.But strictly speaking can be deemed by bank to not be fresh funds. Up to u if u want to take the risk.,btohqsg
Will not work. The issue is that their definition of incremental fresh funds include all hsbc accounts with your name in them  regardless of whether it's joint or single acc,btohqsg
Unless you don't have a common account owner between the single and joint accounts  then it will work,btohqsg
‚ÄúDeposits ADB‚Äù means the sum of average daily balances for a given calendar month  taking into account the deposits in customer‚Äôs Eligible Account. For the avoidance of doubt  Deposits ADB excludes all deposits in HSBC Premier Accounts  SGD Current Accounts  SGD Savings Accounts  Singapore Dollar Time Deposit accounts  Secured Overdraft Accounts  SmartMortgage Accounts  Flexi Accounts  eFlexi Accounts and Investment Financing Accounts.‚ÄúFresh Funds‚Äù means a deposit of funds from outside of HSBC into the Eligible Account. Transfers from existing HSBC bank deposit accounts or via HSBC cheque(s)  cashier‚Äôs order (s) or demand draft(s) do not qualify. Funds that are transferred from existing or closed HSBC accounts in the last 30 days are also excluded.,btohqsg
It will actually work based on practical experiences. But as said if hsbc wants to implement the tnc will allow them to disqualify the 1% bonus.Because definition of eligible account is hsbc Ega account with them. Which includes both the single and joint account balances.,btohqsg
What are u trying to stir here?,btohqsg
