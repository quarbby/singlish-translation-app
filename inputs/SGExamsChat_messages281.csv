Btw anyone know how to do linked list,btohqsg
Chio minimum 8/10 type of looks,btohqsg
I dont even understand the basics,btohqsg
WAit why are you learning python??,btohqsg
u need node then u need destination to the next node,btohqsg
What do y’all learn in computing actually,btohqsg
Dw say this ah but the notes they give us is utter bullshit,btohqsg
Ok bye I'm gonna go back for lunch,btohqsg
My classmates agree we dont understand shit,btohqsg
i like how ur saying she's ur bestfriend so many times 🤡,btohqsg

No time to learn everything since due tdy haha,btohqsg
Idk they say the first 3 months of comsci,btohqsg
sflr btw im at don don donki,btohqsg
LMAO luckily yours over la huh,btohqsg
Since urs havent want to do mine?,btohqsg
but still relatively high compared to others,btohqsg
too bad cybersec is a cost centre  i'm sure if there wasn't a need no one would bother with it,btohqsg
Wait... There are pointers in python??,btohqsg
there isn't but you can still implement linked lists with oop,btohqsg
Anyone here from NUS CS2040 ah,btohqsg
unless u were AY19/20 Sem 2,btohqsg
still dont think its the best,btohqsg
but no pointers in other langs,btohqsg
U know how do? Can save?,btohqsg
Lol I dont understand shit abt linked list haha,btohqsg
Feels like oop on steroids to me,btohqsg
A node of a linked list is just a structure that holds 1) a value and 2) a pointer to the next node. The linked list itself holds the pointer to the 1st node (the head) and facilitates adding nodes to the tail  deleting nodes from within etc etc,btohqsg
if an array is a piece of contiguous memory  then linked list is something very similar but it can be found all over memory. The nodes record where the next node is that's all,btohqsg
there's plenty of applications of linked lists actually  in fact your file system that you use on your computer stores files as a linked list,btohqsg
Oh ok I think I have problems with the implementation mostly,btohqsg
plenty of resources online especially for something as simple as a linked list 😊,btohqsg
it's like one of the 1st data structure introduced in any ds course,btohqsg
Hi guys anyone here studying psychology?,btohqsg
Oh which route did they took?,btohqsg
oh hahaha fellow computing student here too.. yall so fast learn LL ah,btohqsg

Hey guys anyone that took cbp? Aft year 1 is there a need to take an exam or smth to go to the business course I want?,btohqsg
not from cbp but no exam to take  this being said there are exams part of your curriculum though. you go into the business course based on availability  popularity of the course and ur gpa,btohqsg
thats for np  not too sure abt other poly's cbp but should be the same lol,btohqsg
Anybody know any software to program on??,btohqsg
Like software to build  debug and run coding projects on,btohqsg
are you referring to integrated dev environments? (IDE),btohqsg
I’m new to this type of stuff,btohqsg
Anything that I can create a programming project on,btohqsg
what kind of projects are you looking to do? on which languages?,btohqsg
I’m just attempting to practically apply what I’ve learnt about python,btohqsg
Unless u want a full ide with a debugger,btohqsg
IDLE is better for python  i feel,btohqsg
Hmmm ok I’ll give it a shot,btohqsg
But I have like no clue how to use vs code,btohqsg
I don’t even know how to debug the code,btohqsg
Oh that one u need extensions haha,btohqsg
Ye I installed the python one already,btohqsg
breakpoints are places where the code will stop for u to read variables and analysis what's wrong,btohqsg
Oh so basically the breakpoint determined which section of the code is debugged by VS code,btohqsg
So anything below is not debugged,btohqsg
so you can move line by line instead of having to rerun the whole code,btohqsg
I’ll give IDLE and VS code a shot them,btohqsg
See if I can figure out how to use them for programs,btohqsg
ngl pycharm was quite buggy when I used it,btohqsg
I feel vscode way better but,btohqsg
not a pythong guy but agree that vscode is damn good for a lot of diff languages,btohqsg
So u may wanna check them out,btohqsg
I mean stl of most languages,btohqsg
if you wanna do websites  you're better off w learning JS,btohqsg
I'm not a python guy as well  so tbf I dunno abt py stl. But last time I saw it  it was quite developed,btohqsg
Could ya send the link for standard library??,btohqsg
That one I'm quite sure it's in the documentations  you shd be able to find it,btohqsg
when u code u dont usually need linked list that's the thing,btohqsg
MANGO SHOULD GIMME FOR FREE BECAUSE IM HER FRIEND ☺️☺️☺️,btohqsg
Most of the time u dont need,btohqsg
mmm usually u just need to understand it conceptually,btohqsg
Ifs only good when array size changes hahah,btohqsg
however if u have large amounts of data its quite hard to append/delete so you'd use linked list,btohqsg
u probably wont need arrays that are more than ten thousand length,btohqsg
@TelebotSGur commands aint working for me,btohqsg
there are least two of these kind of bots,btohqsg
Today is teacher's day eve ma😂,btohqsg
Bruh there are students mugging tdy,btohqsg

hi yall pls recommend good genki dishes i'm tryna expand my food horizons or wtv THANKS,btohqsg
I'm discounting the Part 2 tracks,btohqsg
(honestly why couldn't kanye just put jay z and dababy on the same jail track),btohqsg
"So I consider ""no child left behind"" as the final track",btohqsg
The first part is awesone  the 2nd part is vibey,btohqsg
The second part feels more sad (again  I'm not considering the part 2 tracks),btohqsg
"My favourites are ""Hurricane"" & ""No Child Left Behind""",btohqsg
Can't go wrong with the weeknd,btohqsg
Surprise he can compkement lil baby,btohqsg
hurricane is one of the only few nice songs,btohqsg
Haha thats what my teacher said jn,btohqsg
It's okay  CLB is coming soon. Yet  the merch and cover art though...,btohqsg

hi  this a bit of a strange question. After seeing a documentary about a lady going back to her hometown to find her childhood friend. I've set out to do the same. Could I share what I know and see if by any chance anyone knows her here?,btohqsg

im also chinese but i am not from china,btohqsg
i feel the need to make the distinction,btohqsg
yea of course ethnic Chinese ≠ Chinese nationaljust that Singaporeans love to use one word for both I guess,btohqsg
for me I usually just call Chinese nationals as mainlanders since I've seen them call themselves 大陸人 as wellbut eh to each their own,btohqsg

The album cover is also horrible,btohqsg
Which clown thought it would be a good idea to spam pregnant women emotes,btohqsg
Please tell me it's just a joke,btohqsg
It's so thematically different from everything he has done,btohqsg
Oh God  please tell me he'll actually update it soon,btohqsg
I'm looking through the lyrics and I'm too fond of them,btohqsg
I've yet to even listen to it but damn,btohqsg

actually  it’s alright  thanks i decided i can jus modify the prev practicals i did jus that i won’t actly look at he procedure and try planning it on my own?? although it isn’t rlly the same..,btohqsg
Can some one explain to me difference between IB and a level,btohqsg
Is it just the subjects you choose,btohqsg
ib typically takes the ib diploma exam,btohqsg
a level takes a level exam,btohqsg
the subjects are also diff topics,btohqsg
were you in the Cities: Skylines discord?,btohqsg
The syllabus within each subject is different as well. Uni application-wise  IB is more for international whereas alvl is more for internal,btohqsg
Even though I'm not a big fan of donda,btohqsg
Good but why couldn't kanye just combine both,btohqsg
Off the grid and moon for me,btohqsg
And he got too many features,btohqsg
Jesus lord is 8 minutes and pt 2 is 11 minutes,btohqsg
I don't remember kanye or jay electronica having different verses so couldn't they just drop pt 2,btohqsg
I never really listen to pop music but Donda was pretty good,btohqsg
[IB]What are the pros and cons of going to IB? What made me go IB and did I regret my choice?https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/izcukf/ibwhat_are_the_pros_and_cons_of_going_to_ib_what/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share,btohqsg
😂😂 what other similar albums would you recommend to someone who doesn't really listen to pop,btohqsg
feels so weird saying I don't listen to pop but it is what it is,btohqsg
Wat genre/artist do u listen to?,btohqsg
Personally not a popfan as well but i listen to quite a variety of genres,btohqsg
depends what I'm feeling likeI think earlier today I listened to Donda and it was the first time in a while I properly sat down to listen to musiclooking at my library most of it is rock and metal (dream theater  pink Floyd  beatles)there's also some jazz (Dave brubeck  Joe Pass) and Japanese city pop (Tatsuro Yamashita  Taeko Onuki)sometimes I listen to more indie stuff like Vulfpeck  Sufjan Stevens  and The Avalanches,btohqsg
I see  that's cool! You should listen to alternative Hip-Hop  my dude.,btohqsg
For rock  i listen to muse  paramore  daughtry & thirty seconds to marsFor indie  i tend to listen to john mayer & tame impala,btohqsg
Hehe the more underground  the better imo,btohqsg
Those two are great examples for alternative Hip-Hop,btohqsg
Wouldve recc All My Heroes Are Cornballs & Man On The Moon III,btohqsg
Baw Baw Black Sheep another good one,btohqsg
More unparalleled lyricism from our certified boy lover,btohqsg
He said hes a les in 2 tracks,btohqsg
Which is the best Man on The Moon in your opinion?,btohqsg
"not many like pop anymore ;""(",btohqsg
nothing wrong with people exploring other genres of music ;),btohqsg
Pop will always remain the most mainstream genre,btohqsg
Even when there are other genres  they tend to infuse with the pop genre,btohqsg
Most of my friends all move alr,btohqsg
Im the only one that still like it the most,btohqsg
I can't wait for Pusha-T to come back and clown Drake,btohqsg
If you have a song about literally having sex with fans  maybe you might want to reconsider the song.,btohqsg
Drake and kanye saw this and decided to stop their silly competition,btohqsg
Also  I'm seriously hoping Drake will change that cover art.,btohqsg
Is there any physical copies of CLB yet? No  right?,btohqsg
Hi guysI have something to ask y'allCan I use the expired hand lotion? Will using the expired hand lotion cause skin problem?,btohqsg
Its not fud so u should be fine,btohqsg
why would it have an expiration date hmmm,btohqsg
Please tell me Drake will actually change the cover art,btohqsg
I feel weird just looking at the cover art when it's in my explore tab,btohqsg
just dun listen to the album,btohqsg
that shit was his form of aesthetics,btohqsg
The black background is infinite times better than whatever shit ass cover drake has,btohqsg
the weird gray maroon cover was better,btohqsg
I still don't get how the cover art relates to anything in the album,btohqsg
idk his rollout was the strangest in history,btohqsg
I'm perfectly fine with the flower and yellow font Drake did for last year when he announced CLB,btohqsg
Please  BTI was the most mysterious rollout in my opinion that still made sense,btohqsg
Kanye kinda fell off after he dropped yeezus,btohqsg
I rather see his face again than 12 pregnant women emoji,btohqsg
i kinda like kids see ghost,btohqsg
