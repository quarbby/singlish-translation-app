such as not sexual or something. No idea,btohqsg
I had to google it as well. Something like not safe for work,btohqsg
Ya sth along that line ðŸ˜…like kinky  not safe for work,btohqsg
You can afford to go overseas university and you still call yourself poor?,btohqsg
Yeah  otherwise the government would have given me $300 or $0,btohqsg
I planned to stay in Singapore,btohqsg
But later it became very clear it would be detrimental to my health,btohqsg
Plus Singapore's tuition fees aren't that cheap for citizens anyways,btohqsg
Although I save on accomodation and all that though,btohqsg
It is cheap for citizens no?,btohqsg
But it's still cheaper than most overseas universities by a large amount,btohqsg
(Except those free ones with questionable quality),btohqsg
is quite cheap alr liao ba,btohqsg
Not quite. Some other countries are a few thousand,btohqsg
but best to enter uni when f2f resume,btohqsg
Yes but what about ranking and quality?,btohqsg
I don't want to say it to 2000 people  but it has already taken a toll on my mental health,btohqsg
Would you really go to a Swedish/Norwegian university with less than 1K tuition fee?,btohqsg
I don't care about ranking anymore to be honest. Quality is good.I have a different set of requirements compared to most people,btohqsg
I mean my university produces prize winners  so...,btohqsg
Yeah. I grew up elsewhere and came to Singapore for JC. Something happened and it became clear that I can't live in Singapore for much longer.,btohqsg
Well if you're talking about mental health  JC is the worst,btohqsg
It took a toll on me too,btohqsg
Not about academics. I was fine. I don't wish to elaborate but it caused my grades from lots of As to failure,btohqsg
But of course I did well enough to get into lots of places in the end,btohqsg
But the mental health struggle was terrible,btohqsg
If you are at the point sitting for an exam and cannot even really do the exam because your mind is not even thinking straight  it is very serious,btohqsg
Many people suffer from mental illness,btohqsg
I find Singapore's mental health support inadequate. Yeah  better than where I grew up but it's not great,btohqsg
Ya their support not very thorough,btohqsg
and which countryâ€™s mental health support system is good?,btohqsg
Korean's? Don't know about them but I imagine it is not great,btohqsg
in singapore they at least find help,btohqsg
US  UK. Not sure about Canada,btohqsg
They get lock up in there,btohqsg
Woodbridge hospital has a stigma to it. Which is actually quite sad,btohqsg
Ok so that talliesThe suicide rates,btohqsg
I've heard bad stories about IMH,btohqsg
Yalor so many kpop stars committed suicide,btohqsg
Ya. I was guessing some switzerland norweigian country  is it right?,btohqsg
It's so sad... And some people say people that commit suicide are stupid or foolish. But that is false. You are essentially driven into a corner with no escape route,btohqsg
Yes. They don't bother changing their coordinates to match the victim's frame of reference and think from their POV,btohqsg
They look at it from their own perspectives,btohqsg
I was starting to contemplate suicide in JC1,btohqsg
I'm way past that  so clearly I'm not in that situation,btohqsg
Oh idk i dun feel so at all - not anymore. I feel educated generation like ours should embrace mental issues. Esp when society modernize  things get complicated. I went to mood disorder unit at imh last time  the young patients there were mostly highflyers - ntu grads  big 4 firm auditors  rjcian  acjcians..,btohqsg
Had I gone to the army I'd almost certainly kill myself. The mental health system in there is quite bad,btohqsg
YaAnd they r not considered to have committed crime under that mental state,btohqsg
Ah yes let's not talk about SAF,btohqsg
I'm sorry to hear that. Hope you are alright now,btohqsg
