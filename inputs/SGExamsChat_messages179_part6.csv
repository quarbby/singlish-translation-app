Today I playing among in class I had a feeling it was 2 girls being the imposter,btohqsg
I never say anything and they were the imposters of the game,btohqsg

hi um idk if this is the right platform to ask butI'm studying in an IP school  have pretty good GPA  and A1 for geography. my subject combi in sec 3 and 4 is trip sci geog.should I take geog or econs for jc?why I cant decide:- i have slightly more interest in geog than econs- econs has 5% higher distinction rate than geog (national level  2017)- geog has revised syllabus next year  so it will be slightly easier I guess?- shit ton of content for geog- heard from seniors that most of them end up gg to econs tuition when they cant catch up- most students in my sch take up econs- maybe abt 2-3 classes of geog in jc- econs is a complete new subject and I'm not sure if I'll do well- both subjects are not prerequisites for any uni coursesthe other subjects I want to take is physics chemistry mathpls help! h2 geog or h2 econs,btohqsg
Its likely ur not gg to score,btohqsg
econs is more common sensical than geog,btohqsg
honestly because its a new sub i feel h2 econs? and some things honestly quite common sense wan,btohqsg
so i would say econs if u want an easier time  geog is a content heavy subject  equivalent to h2 bio,btohqsg
the best thing is to be motivated by interest  but if you know its gonna be harder u gotta work smarter and harder,btohqsg
and econs u get to draw graphs! so cool,btohqsg
is econs easier to score? but I  have more interest in geog,btohqsg
if u have interest in geog  just take geog,btohqsg
dont have to think much one,btohqsg
is it true that jc need to mug everyday....,btohqsg
I never revise before exams and I work fine risky move,btohqsg
econs how much to study ah,btohqsg
i feel its not a  lot,btohqsg
its really not that content heavy,btohqsg
Look at the distinction rate for the school that is offering it?,btohqsg
but i take h1 econs  may be a different story,btohqsg
Not much o level econs is quite easy IMO,btohqsg
what is the rate for both to begin with is it already low,btohqsg
Distinction rate for my sch last year was like 84% for 2019 and the previous year 93%,btohqsg
oh so its more than 2 lines they call curves intersecting and call it equilibrium?,btohqsg
I escaped to telegram cos no one knew me,btohqsg
Is easy to guess schs that dw say dist rate,btohqsg
oh my rv i want go I screw so badly,btohqsg
my sch gives v vague results,btohqsg
If I took hmt and went to a decent cca hais,btohqsg
In my opinion o level econs still has less to study than just elect geog itself like I only revised econs the day before prelims can still do decently,btohqsg
rv has I think 1/6 6 dist,btohqsg
always lose marks for this type of bs,btohqsg
Nvm just saw ur message and realised ur talking about it at a JC level  I have to say H2 econs seems to be a fair bit harder than o level econsand since it’s a new subject you might need more time to adjust to it but I feel that once you get the grasp of it  u should be fine,btohqsg
I heard from seniors that a lot of them fail h2 econs in J1,btohqsg
RV year what wear long pants?,btohqsg
then just clutch A in a levels somehow,btohqsg
Just take subjects u are passionate in,btohqsg
so do I geog or econs,btohqsg
U wont wanna take a subject u have no interesf in,btohqsg
I end up from likin jc econs to hatin it,btohqsg
hay i take chem   but i kinda have no choice LOL,btohqsg
Which part of it did you hate,btohqsg
If I go jc I’m definitely considering econs,btohqsg
Got the fella that get some masters rite,btohqsg
