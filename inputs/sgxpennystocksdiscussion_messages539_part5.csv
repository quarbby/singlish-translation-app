Moya Asia ($0.066/0.067)- Possible double bottom reversal set up in the making- Price have touched 2nd bottom $0.062 and reverse back into a more liquid zone (above 0.065) where it closed $0.067 about the most recent red dotted downtrend line- Results for Moya was actually good (extrapolate it  it is about 6-7 PE for FY21) making approx 40 -42 Mil Sgd  but yet threw down to flush from recent $0.073  IMO probably to do this double bottom set up and collect back cheaper from retailers.(Note: $0.062-$0.065 is an illiquid zone where there is no real actual buying or selling)- MACD about to cross up too- OBV divergence evidentIn summary  all research on this one ‚òùÔ∏è is pointing upwards. Flush is over. Its time.Furthermore  we are back to default work from home  which refers to increased market participation.Hence  time to watch this one closely  especially if they break above the neckline $0.072. DYODDPS: Gateway Fund investment costs in this one is about $0.095-$0.10 And they ain‚Äôt stupid money üí∞,btohqsg

Quite sad. My sister's colleague kid kena covid from classmate in school. End up cannot take psle  mother every day crying. Prelim results all red  no second chance to take psle,btohqsg
For listening compre.. can‚Äôt take prelim results??,btohqsg
Psle 1st paper starting 30th sep. No luxury of time. Those cannot take psle have to use prelim results. Prelim is not national standard exam. Different school different standard. Usually prelim more difficult ... no matter how you moderate  it's still not the same. Also  it's like a sportsman priming himself for competition. Some of the kids at prelim time still haven't reach their peak,btohqsg
I tot have some percentage% if the kid can‚Äôt manage It..MOE will do some adjustments.Not matter what MOE will push the students to sec?,btohqsg
I mean can‚Äôt go express steam,btohqsg
All red = fail liao lor. No chance o go normal stream also.,btohqsg
Nor matter what still go sec..,btohqsg
Cannot take psle  no chance to fight for normal stream also.,btohqsg
All these really sounds like gov screw up big time... Haizz,btohqsg
The fail also have some issues the kid.. repeat is the worse results..I mean 3 subjects fail..then repeat‚Ä¶ others depending wonder can appeal..,btohqsg
supermarket lot of ppl 2day ?,btohqsg
Might need letters from MPs for MOE to take it seriously,btohqsg
Actually if peilm n whole yrperformance. Nowadays all base on A to F..If the kid at sch good in CCA..Also have chance.,btohqsg
As I know  Moe don‚Äôt want the kid repeat in primary sch..they have to push to sec..,btohqsg
Mc your kid.. in primary or sec?,btohqsg
CCS must be very angry with OYK now ü§£,btohqsg
Forward as received :This is happening in SingaporeDidn‚Äôt realise the situation is so bad with the stay at home self recovery ..._Any of you knows anybody who is undergoing the same experience??_  üëáüèºMOH will say home recovery. For my household  brother was PCR +ve last Monday. Dad ART +ve last Friday.I call and call MOH to send down to swab for dad  no one came on Friday  no one came on Saturday  Sunday finally swab at 11pm. ended up  Monday results both mum and dad PCR +ve. I call MOH  they just say symptoms mild is okay to stay at home.SO WHAT?! WAIT FOR US TO PCR +ve AND SERIOUS SYMPTOMS THEN HELP IS IT.Ended up my dad Monday PCR +ve results come out  on the samep Monday serious p and sent to TTSH. after that  7+ hours waiting at ANE from 4pm no food nothing   later change to a hall with a trolley bed at 12am 21 hours waiting with 20+ others  2 days never shower. Now finally can ward him.Now my mother is quarantined in the master bedroom  no doctor to check obviously  no medication. she coughing  runny nose  sore throat.i call MOH. MOH say call GP.

Clinic tell my relative say cannot. if want cough and flu medicine  must do pcr swab  see doctor and stay at home for 5 days.

MOH REPLY ONLY PCR -ve then is recovered.so my quarantine order from 13th Sep to today  22nd Sep has extended to 30th Sep cus my family members still tested pcr +ve   everyone is just waiting.How safe is it to recover at home?No medical attention to my mother.My brother discharged but coughing like crazy  not isolated. wait until serious like my dad then can go hospital?THIS WHOLE THING IS JUST A WAITING GAME. CALL WAIT CALL WAIT.NO HELP SEND TO US.WAIT AND WAIT. WAITING FOR EVERYONE IN THE HOUSEHOLD TO GET PCR +ve is itMOH help what? SINGAPORE IS NOT PREPARED TO OPEN UP THE ECONOMY. NOTHING IS DONE FOR COVID POSITIVE PEOPLE AT HOME.,btohqsg
This is from yesterday's ST. Govt wait so long then implement HBL  especially when so many cases in the community. Parents also cannot keep their kids at home ... bo pian need send kids to school and kena exposed,btohqsg

nowadays primary school syllabus very different liao lor. You go google primary school maths. see how many you can solve without using concepts you learnt in secondary school such as algebra.Their primary school science. some of the terms they learnt  i have never heard before also,btohqsg
Coz parents complain pri maths difficulties ma.. then moe take away Olympia Maths..much more easy for the kid..,btohqsg
Model - only for kid cannot ready might it..nowadays using short cut..also can‚Äôt apply more algebra..,btohqsg
PSLE streaming is a really big event for the kids... I can understand why parents are anxious over this mess and potential unfairness... Given all the planning and resources poured in over a long period,btohqsg
