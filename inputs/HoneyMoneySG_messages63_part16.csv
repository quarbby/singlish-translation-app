Is it right that CIMB savings account is only looking at only month end date balances? Eg: 31 Aug vs 30 Sept. in the middle you can just shift in and out of the funds?,btohqsg
My interpretation is if you arenew to CIMB customer:1. Your interest will consist of two parts: base andbonusinterest2). The interest (both base and bonus) you earned are calculated based on daily balance in your account.3). Whether you can eventually get thebonusinterest is depends on your this month end balance compare against previous month end balance.,btohqsg
Hi does this means i get 3% cash back?,btohqsg
Makes more sense in this manner- being a two tier criteria rather than just looking at the month end balances. Seems like your balance could go up/down Intra month but just make sure its more than the previous month end date on the last day of the current month.Some hints dropped in tnc that the bonus interest accrues *daily*.,btohqsg
Provided you meet the minimum spend requirements and did not exceed maximum cashback requirements.,btohqsg
