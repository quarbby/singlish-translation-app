Remind me of how pri sch it is mandatory to read a book during assembly…there is like 20-30min of reading period and if we dun read / forgot bring book  the prefect asks us to stand up…then specifically mon-wed EL thurs fri CL,btohqsg
Instead of prefect its chers now thk,btohqsg
Idk why i remember pri sch stuff better than my sec sch stuff,btohqsg
I just remembered how in sec sch i will make the effort to reach sch before 7am to avoid seeing prefects at the gate💀💀,btohqsg
It is a luxury i hv for staying within 25min fr the sch💀,btohqsg
Mine is now 7.30 and 7.40,btohqsg
They always say they write me in their book for primary school,btohqsg
Arrive by 7.30 to 10 min reading,btohqsg
I was never booked in pri sch,btohqsg
Surprisingly I never got called probably cuz they dun even know my name.,btohqsg
Coz it is extremely difficult to be booked in pri sch,btohqsg

I wonder which jc is afternoon session,btohqsg
I wish…then i dunnid rush to sch,btohqsg
Yea from 2016 all pri sch shifted to single session,btohqsg
thats why so many students complaining lor,btohqsg
Previously it was mostly p1-3 afternoon session and p4-6 morning session…some were only p1-2 i think,btohqsg
It was because of lack of resources or sth i believe,btohqsg
it was because there were lack of musicians,btohqsg
They failed to produce a musician,btohqsg
If only tele has the roll eye emoji as react,btohqsg
They know they have some prospect of musician becoming a musician,btohqsg
So they shift to 1 sesh,btohqsg
Wasnt it a MOE move or sth,btohqsg
No lmao a MOE push but not a mandate,btohqsg
I recalled my siblings lamenting only i get the 3 yrs of lower pri afternoon session,btohqsg
Because my pri sch shifted to single session in 2016,btohqsg
My still double session but tbh I preferred the morning session,btohqsg
Both had its pros and cons,btohqsg
Mostly cuz my form teacher was chill and allowed me to be late for like 5-10 mins usually,btohqsg
But omo the afternoon session ends really late  reach home at 7pm or even ltr,btohqsg
The afternoon session makes me damn shag,btohqsg
Wah damn but wasnt it the prefects doing the booking,btohqsg
Nothing opens too so morning do that sianz,btohqsg
Well I was big even in Primary school,btohqsg
Nearing my menstration of cmi-ness fr,btohqsg
Meanwhile the sch bus left w/o me before then my form teacher sent me home💀💀,btohqsg
The classic excuse I give to my PE teacher,btohqsg
My maths Cher was da best,btohqsg
The boy who cried dog yes,btohqsg
I got carpool in her car so many times it was awesome,btohqsg

I tell u my pe cher best,btohqsg
IT WAS A GRP OF US LMAO,btohqsg
he work part time grab driver,btohqsg
My pe cher mostly pain in ass,btohqsg
No phone hahaha those didn't even exist in my day we use the single pay phones,btohqsg
I borrowed security guard phone to contact my dad…then my dad asked me to go look for the tcr💀💀,btohqsg
Remember having at least 5 5 cent coins in my wallet,btohqsg
Next time i do 2.4 in underwear,btohqsg
So if I need to make a quick call back to my mother to pick me up I can,btohqsg
Throw my non pe pants at them,btohqsg
There was once i forgot my bus card…i only had a $10 note then the driver just let me in w/o paying,btohqsg
I remember back then bus was like 45 cents,btohqsg
Oh oso now i realise why i quit badminton,btohqsg
I realized i mixed 2 incidents up,btohqsg
Think was cus i lost in badminton in sch games day,btohqsg
Used to be able to take a 50 cent coin put it in the uncle would accept that,btohqsg
As a badminton cca against non badminton,btohqsg
I had to pay 70 cents????,btohqsg
I knew i was not made for this anymore,btohqsg
Basically now only dollar coins can bring you,btohqsg
So the first incident was i still in after sch care centre then i think i was playing w my friends for a while then the teacher left alr so i borrowed guard phone to contact my dad who called them to get a cher to fetch me there lol,btohqsg
I remember getting bitten in the child care before,btohqsg
Then the 2nd incident was i was helping my cher w stuff and ended up missing my sch bus…then i think he already told me if i missed my bus to go look for him in the staffrm,btohqsg
I never went for childcare in pri sch,btohqsg
Also I was a bad kid and fucked with the system. Our student care was link with the school so they had like meal vouchers printed out from A4 paper for us to use at the canteen for meals,btohqsg
I remember getting bullied by this dude but the teacher purposely make me sit w him,btohqsg
I remember taking 1 sheet from the teacher when they not looking,btohqsg
Then from then onwards I just copy and print my own,btohqsg
The coupons so they print out in A4 papers then cut it out,btohqsg
1 paper had like 12 coupons each for 1 meal,btohqsg
Oh ur childcare u attended was inside the sch?,btohqsg
I remember student care they got coloured coupons then i have to pay with my own money,btohqsg
I remember it was some orange shirt,btohqsg
at the back it says student care....,btohqsg
Mine was just the school uniform lmao,btohqsg
But i also dun think there is only 1 chain childcare lol,btohqsg
then for my pri sch they change it to kidz treehouse idk lah,btohqsg
As in we hv our childcare uniform but for excursions…normal day we just wear sch uniform,btohqsg
It was then I learnt the lesson of inflation and devaluation if u flood the supply,btohqsg
But they serve different schs within reasonable distance,btohqsg
Mine didn't have a childcare uniform the school uniform is the childcare one,btohqsg
So I slowly did it I only gave it to my friends and use it for myself like 1-2 meals at a time,btohqsg
So if I wanted a second helping it was my forged stash,btohqsg
No cuz I limited how many I gived out,btohqsg
wait sorry random qn but isit other poly can see all ur write up for eae,btohqsg
I know that if the tally was off by too much they would notice,btohqsg
Limit it to giving out 1 sheet max per month,btohqsg
??? I believe the polys are not related…like they dun share the same system…,btohqsg
They can only see the choice u put them at,btohqsg
rlly i swear my ecg teacher say leh,btohqsg
Back in my day u had 3 boxes for the write ups for each option,btohqsg
like i rmb someone sqid like even though if it is the same course but diff poly cannot write the same write up for both,btohqsg
Abuden change it so it says that polys name and course la,btohqsg
Each box corresponds to the option above,btohqsg
I believe it is not strict strict a no but i mean different poly same course is not 100% the same  u can prob tailor it abit,btohqsg
At the end in p6 they did off hand mentioned that my coupons were often cut slightly off. Which made sense tbh cuz kids have the dexterity of a person with oven mittens,btohqsg
No they didn't lmao it was like a cheeky I see what u did there,btohqsg
I limited the supply lmao I didn't spend too much,btohqsg
Currency is only as good as the amount of liquidity u can muster up,btohqsg
I dunno how i managed to get my p6 cher to write a good enough testimonial to get me the dsa,btohqsg
They caught me based on my cutting lmao,btohqsg
But then again my pri sch dsa success rate is 90% lmao,btohqsg
For 5 years they never noticed,btohqsg
I just went in with my T score,btohqsg

They sold that off i believe,btohqsg
Yeah and they made the Japanese Zero Fighter as well,btohqsg
Actually yes. It was descent from the Mitsubishi clan during the Tokugawa Shogun rule I think,btohqsg
The feudal and caste system of the Tokugawa can be saved for the history during the Sengoku period.,btohqsg
U laugh now but Edo present day Tokyo was set up by Tokugawa Ieyasu lmao,btohqsg
If not for him probably the capital would be Osaka or Kyoto,btohqsg
The capital of japan was kyoto before it became tokyo,btohqsg
南京was once the capital of china,btohqsg
is like saying tiannanmen was always the capital city of china,btohqsg
why Taiwan is part of China coz it's still under roc（中华民国）which capital is Nanjing（南京）,btohqsg
Why is saiz ice cubes so clear,btohqsg
Lol i thought it was funan for a sec,btohqsg
Kyoto was the capital for the Emperor but without Tokugawa assuming Certis Paribus then the Shogun would have been the descendents of the Toyotomi Clan... based in Osaka Castle.,btohqsg
I just washed my hair AMA,btohqsg

After a period of intense busyness  I have a few go-to activities that help me unwind and recharge. One of the first things I do is take a long walk in nature. The simple act of immersing myself in the natural environment  away from screens and noise  allows me to clear my mind. I find walking along a wooded trail or beside a serene lake particularly soothing. The fresh air  the sound of birds  and the sight of greenery all work together to create a peaceful atmosphere that helps me relax and regain mental clarity. This activity is enjoyable because it combines physical movement with the meditative aspects of nature  providing both a physical and psychological reset.Another activity I turn to is reading a good book. Diving into a well-written novel or an engaging non-fiction book transports me to different worlds and perspectives  providing a mental escape from the pressures of daily life. Reading stimulates my imagination and intellect  offering a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. It's an enjoyable way to disconnect from my own concerns and immerse myself in the lives and ideas of others. This shift in focus can be incredibly refreshing and rejuvenating  making it easier to return to my tasks with renewed energy and creativity.Listening to music is also a vital part of my relaxation routine. Depending on my mood  I might choose classical music for its calming effects  jazz for its soothing rhythms  or upbeat pop to lift my spirits. Music has a unique ability to influence emotions  and I find that creating a playlist tailored to my current state of mind can be incredibly effective in reducing stress and enhancing my mood. The melodies and harmonies provide an auditory escape that can be both comforting and invigorating.Lastly  I enjoy practicing mindfulness and meditation. Taking a few moments to sit quietly  focus on my breath  and observe my thoughts without judgment helps me center myself. This practice not only reduces stress but also improves my overall sense of well-being. Mindfulness and meditation allow me to be present in the moment  letting go of the worries and anxieties that often accompany a busy schedule. This mental discipline fosters a deeper connection to myself and helps me maintain a balanced perspective.Each of these activities—walking in nature  reading  listening to music  and practicing mindfulness—provides a different form of relaxation that I find deeply enjoyable. They offer physical  mental  and emotional benefits  helping me to unwind and recharge after periods of busyness. These practices are essential for maintaining my well-being and ensuring that I can approach my responsibilities with a clear and focused mind.,btohqsg
Probably one of those tazers used as pranks,btohqsg

Unwinding After a Busy DayAfter a day filled with deadlines  errands  and mental exertion  unwinding and de-stressing become crucial for both my mental and physical well-being. My personal toolkit for relaxation is a blend of activities that engage my senses  quiet my mind  and sometimes even get my body moving.One of my favorite ways to unwind is by curling up with a good book. Immersing myself in a captivating story allows me to escape the day's worries and enter a world of imagination. The act of reading itself is calming  with the focused attention directing my thoughts away from the daily grind.Another activity I find highly enjoyable is spending time in nature. Taking a walk in a park  listening to the rustle of leaves and the chirping of birds  has a profound effect on my mood. Immersing myself in the sights and sounds of nature allows me to reconnect with a sense of peace and tranquility.For times when I crave a more physical release  gentle yoga or stretching routines come to the rescue. The slow  deliberate movements help loosen tight muscles and quiet the mind. The focus on my breath during yoga practice further enhances the calming effect  leaving me feeling centered and rejuvenated.Finally  on occasion  I find that spending time with loved ones is the perfect way to unwind. Having a conversation sharing a laugh  or simply enjoying their company allows me to feel connected and supported. The social interaction takes my mind off the day's stress and fosters a sense of belonging.The reason these activities are so enjoyable is that they cater to different aspects of my well-being. Reading and spending time in nature provide a mental escape  while yoga and social interaction offer a release for both my body and mind. By incorporating this variety into my relaxation routine  I ensure that I'm addressing the different types of fatigue accumulated throughout a busy day.Overall  these simple practices allow me to de-stress  recharge  and return to my daily activities feeling refreshed and ready to tackle whatever challenges come my way.,btohqsg
how did it get thru customs lol,btohqsg
It was some Indo gum lmao,btohqsg
brought gum back by plane b4,btohqsg
Oso got lj to asr next week pog,btohqsg

E is still a pass and S is a sub-pass so not so bad i guess,btohqsg
no like  they only deliver to sg right?,btohqsg

Maybe the gums ship illegally? Like they list chewing gums?,btohqsg
Maybe they are sweets / candies etc  not the chewing gums that is illegal here,btohqsg
i reconise the mentos gum packaging,btohqsg
They are all overseas sellers so I mean u report they suspend they just reopen another one,btohqsg

It's like a drop in the bucket,btohqsg
u js put gum in ur search bar  alot of listings come out,btohqsg
shopee cnnt sell vape to sg  gum can,btohqsg
I think shoppee prolly delivers to different countries then they just list coz different countries hv different legislation but the list all the sameIdk,btohqsg
But tbh if like that  ppl can forget then go and order gum fr shoppeeEither forget or pretend to forget or buy online coz obv no brick and mortar,btohqsg
Singapore law just prohibits the import  sale and distribution.,btohqsg
The distribution part is technically not under Shopee but using the fulfillment process of shopee,btohqsg
but tbf right  i think the banning of gum is most prob sg's most relaxed rule,btohqsg
It is an import ban not a consumption ban.,btohqsg
but to consume  u got to import,btohqsg
Personal consumption does not qualify as import,btohqsg
Even if ban it is all different enforcement mechanisms. Vape and Drugs are under the HSA but Drugs are also heavily enforced by CNB.,btohqsg

"""City for the world"" example only exist on yt as a ndp snippet from ndp 1998",btohqsg
We have an obsession with Stars got another is like Reach Out for the Stars or smth,btohqsg
