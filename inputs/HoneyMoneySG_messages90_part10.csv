for fresh funds. can trf out and later trf back?,btohqsg
Not everybody has $2k expenses per month. If have only $400 expenses per month  likely won‚Äôt get much cashback.,btohqsg
$400 expenses how much miles can get ?For Cashback can probably get 3.5%,btohqsg
Miles worth at least 6% to 10% depends on how much individual values the miles.You sure $400 can get 3.5%?,btohqsg
But the 6% to 10% is only when you use it to convert air ticket right ? I believe it's less than that as you also need to pay for the conversion fees and still need to pay for airport tax . It's not completely free for air ticket .,btohqsg
Hence the smart way is to use the correct card for the various categories.Earn the highest cashback or miles for the category.,btohqsg
Can use HSBC revolution cc to get 2.5% plus HSBC account to get additional 1%,btohqsg
Yes miles game is best played when u redeem for business class tickets.,btohqsg
So are you saying the maximum earn rate is about 10% even for miles card ?,btohqsg
Miles card has no fixed answer. It depends on your miles valuation.A good ‚Äúaverage‚Äù valuation used by many is 1.5 cents per mile.Which equates the Uob lady card 6 miles per dollar to be worth about 9% cashback.,btohqsg
This is why I use many different card for different categories to get the highest Cashback possible. But sometimes I find it very troublesome this is why I wonder if miles card can do better rate I want to switch to miles card,btohqsg
Yes I used to be entirely cashback like u about 1 year ago.I started on miles with Uob lady 6 miles per dollar and gradually into 4 miles per dollar cards.It‚Äôs very worth it. Basically u need to have the ability to mix and match (min / max) each cashback / miles card to extract the highest value out of all of them.My monthly household expenditure is minimum $6k-$8k per month and I‚Äôm using these cards.Uob one $2k x 2Citibank cashback $800 x 2Maybank family and friends $800Uob lady $3k x 2 (not always max)Amaze + Citi rewards masterUob ppv (general spend card max $1.1k),btohqsg
6 to 8k .. damn high üòÖ,btohqsg
It may seem high but when u have many people in the household it is quite normal.Another tip for u is get as many people in your umbrella.You are not alone in this world. Pay for your up and down (whether u claim back from them is up to u).Buy groceries for your parents. Give them sub card. Etc.,btohqsg
All those cards x2 means what?,btohqsg
2 of those cards. Household has more than one adult  each can apply one.,btohqsg
I find cashback is easier but they have a cap. Like $500 that kind for UOB one card.,btohqsg
I change to miles because the benefits like better üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
It‚Äôs all about getting used to the terms and conditions and the rules.Both cashback and miles cards have their pros and cons.,btohqsg
So basically you use Cashback and miles card mix . For those no category use miles card .. and for miles card is there minimum spending?,btohqsg
I guess I‚Äôm qualified to say this because I‚Äôm playing both sides now for about 1 year already.,btohqsg
Can share which benefit you find better?,btohqsg
No category = could be using cashback card or miles card. No hard and fast rule. Whichever highest.Miles cards some have minimum spending. Some don‚Äôt.Miles cards some have maximum spending. Some don‚Äôt.,btohqsg
U also need to have a very good understand of how Mccs work.,btohqsg
That means Revo is only 2.5%.Miles card also can earn the extra 1%.,btohqsg
Heh heh I just clicked on Chris shop and saw this. I find it interesting so help him re advert. Won‚Äôt get banned Hor.  Hahaha.,btohqsg
My mile card don‚Äôt have minimum but have maximum.The benefit is like how u would view it I guess. All about timing üòÇWhen I want I want book plane ticket pay cash to and from Japan.Like 2 person cost 1.5k cash. Then if have miles is like a piggy bank accumulate over the years then use to redeem. Then the cost like less painful.Plus SIA if want cancel / change flight easier just pay a fee if using miles. For those pay cash can‚Äôt cancel. More flexibility.Cash back is more of immediate returns every month see some money back.,btohqsg
Benefits wise I no need to explain if you find cash back give moreüòÇ u determine which more convenient bah.,btohqsg
Miles card u need to redeem business class then it will be very worth it.If u only intend to redeem economy class  you might not be better off than receiving cashback and buying a cash economy class ticket.,btohqsg
Hi guys! I‚Äôm new here and having a pickle on which credit cards should I apply for.Basically my expenditure fluctuates a lot  depending on my business trip activities for the month. I thought of getting lady UOB card (travel category) but seems like there‚Äôs a cap of $1000 per month.However my upcoming trip (hotel accommodation will probably around 3x that limit) makes me feel like I‚Äôm wasting miles opportunity.Any advice of credit cards that suits someone with fluctuating expenditures.Let me know any questions also if you might need more details to give a better suggestion.,btohqsg
Get Uob lady solitaire. U can choose 2 categories and up to $3k spend a month no minimum spend.,btohqsg
"Another thing I find it very limited on the miles card is that like what you mentioned the miles only be worth it when comes to redeem business class so which means we are ""forced"" to spend more for the ticket",btohqsg
It‚Äôs more worth for business class if accumulate for very long. For me I just accumulate for 1 year. I don‚Äôt mind using for economy it still works for me.,btohqsg
Like the Japan trip I looking at now  for cash payment don‚Äôt have the flight timing I want. If use miles than can give me the timing I wantüòÇ,btohqsg
Yes that is correct. I have this same thinking too.A redemption business class ticket will still always cost more in real value compared to economy class cash ticket.Using some figures:Singapore to Tokyo return ticketCash economy $900Cash business $3200Redemption economy 54k miles + $100Redemption business 104k miles + $100The redemption business even if your miles only cost 1 cent per mile will still cost you about $1100 real value. More than cash economy of $900.However you are only paying ‚Äú$200‚Äù more in my example for business class instead of 3 times.,btohqsg
Unfortunately I do not meet the requirements for solitaire ü§£.,btohqsg
Apply the dbs world woman card. Is 1.5k üòÖ,btohqsg
U can try Uob visa signature for 4 miles per dollar. But that has certain criteria Such as:1. Must contactless pay for sgd2. Must be foreign currencyBoth with minimum spend $1k max spend $2k.It‚Äôs more complicated than this so I suggest you read the tnc if proceeding.,btohqsg
Sorry is dbs. Just search milelion dbs world woman card. Can read more info.,btohqsg
Thanks! Let me look it up and see if it‚Äôs something that meets my situation,btohqsg
You know I just bought sin to Tokyo around $500 per ticket ..This is another reason I don't use miles card . It limits your selection to certain airlines,btohqsg
Personally dont use it because of the short 1 yr point expiry  that is smth u might need to consider too,btohqsg
Comparing apples to apples ya.Sq with sq.Anyway another strategy I use is:1. One way budget airline with cash2. Return trip with business class redemption.,btohqsg
I check scoot price and SIA price exactly the same. Some more I selected no bag check-in. My as well I go for SIAüòÇ,btohqsg
U booking last minute right?Air tickets must grab / book one year in advance for best deals,btohqsg
8 months later price up already.And scoot can be overpriced.,btohqsg
The KrisFlyer miles can use on scoot and SIAüòÖ,btohqsg
Should be zip or scoot I guessNow I think got ana new budget airline too,btohqsg
I hope air japan pricing is actually budget. For now because they sell thru ana but operated by air japan  the pricing not very de budget leh hahaha,btohqsg
Zipair was a good experience for me. $260 ish with 30kg luggage and food and seat selection one way sin Narita.I have yet to try air Japan. Waiting for DPs.,btohqsg
