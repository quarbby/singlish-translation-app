I mean for him to ascend into a concept,btohqsg
education is one of the best once u see the world,btohqsg
Actually  I rather be those people who collaborate to write textbooks compared to teaching lol,btohqsg
It’s not a very interesting job I would think,btohqsg
You’re just writing the same things everyone has been writing for the past 30 years,btohqsg
as compared to most research assistant/scientist jobs for science grads  being a teacher is actually relatively decent,btohqsg
But every student is learning something for the first time,btohqsg
And it’s cool when they get it,btohqsg
That's why MOE tries to attract people from private sector,btohqsg
But it's not enough to make a change,btohqsg
If you're doing well in private,btohqsg
Why do you want to jump over to public,btohqsg
unless u get those higher positions  then it superscales,btohqsg
i know the exact pay ranges,btohqsg
In the end MOE is only attracting those on the lower end,btohqsg
but i dont think is allowed to be said?,btohqsg
is actually quite good la tbh,btohqsg
usually ppl who jump to private are those who can exceed what MOE gives them on a monthly basis,btohqsg
and not all make it out there  about half fail,btohqsg
or they make less than the monthly salary,btohqsg
Yup  used to want to be a teacher but then I realise my best Teachers are those that have life experience outside the classroom. So relegated it to a retirement job instead lol.,btohqsg
ah thought so for the last statement,btohqsg
i wanted to find another career before going teaching eventually,btohqsg
but if i did that tbh  everythin will go back to point 1,btohqsg
U can be a teacher and also have a life outside skool,btohqsg
i think is possible to have life experience while having a career as a teacher,btohqsg
which i intend to do probs,btohqsg
U need to take a huge pay cut though,btohqsg
If u join moe from private,btohqsg
Eg my maths teacher is a national floorball player,btohqsg
yep  unless u retired from moe before,btohqsg
My other maths teacher is a diver,btohqsg
My other other maths teacher is an actor,btohqsg
They still do all those things,btohqsg
Many phy teachers were engineering grads anyway. Not surprised if their first career was engineer,btohqsg
logically speaking can a bus be 100m?,btohqsg
i was imaging how long usian bolt was running,btohqsg
100m seems pretty long for a bus,btohqsg
actl isnt the pay dependent on ur civil service position,btohqsg
like if u earning 5 digits in the army,btohqsg
they cannot downgrade ur pay etc,btohqsg
A bus is probably about 20 people standing shoulder to shoulder,btohqsg
Average is about 50cm for shoulder width?,btohqsg
no road will be able to accommodate for its turning radius without taking up an unreasonable amount of space,btohqsg
The bus can be like the double buses operated by SMRT,btohqsg
It’s cool  we can just set down some rails so that only the buses can use it,btohqsg
Then they can take their time to curve,btohqsg
Isn't a train just a 100 long bus,btohqsg
Does increase in income affect cross elasticity?,btohqsg
None of them have ever worked so far,btohqsg
