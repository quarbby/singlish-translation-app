i mean he spent his whole adulthood in politics,btohqsg
"he cant comprehend the changing of times and still believes the US is and still is the greatest nation on earth. if you had a hardlook at every major policy he passed or made under his administration..none of it was hard hitting  all of it was along the lines of ""do something to show people we are not doing nothing""",btohqsg
"i doubt anyone was ever familiar with the name ""Joe Biden"" before he sat for his elected term as one of the USA Presidents",btohqsg
biden is very well known in politics  he did alot as a politician..wherever he was posted to,btohqsg
some people are citing reasons for his old age & ailing health for the drastic negative change in the way he handled politics,btohqsg
thats why under obama  he was awarded the presidential medal of freedom,btohqsg
i mean if you consider him as an individual alone,btohqsg
like no one really knew who Biden was or what specifications was he heavily involved as a politician,btohqsg
in the US Sphere he is quite known  outside of the us. he is not until his obama tenure,btohqsg
"sort of ""you heard of something / someone  but it doesn't quite ring a bell yet and can't place a finger on where you heard that""(with whatever your memory stores)",btohqsg
biden was the youngest US senator ever appointed becoming one at 29,btohqsg
ill tell you who wont ring a bell  kofi annan,btohqsg
okay  but aside from all the weird world achievement records of being youngest + oldest  fucked-up / sane persona people in the places where heavyBUSINESS ENTREPRENEURSHIPorGLOBAL / NATIONAL POLITICALis involved,btohqsg
what else do you recall biden for,btohqsg
isn't he that newly elected PM in the UK or is it under the British government,btohqsg
nope former secretary general of the united nations,btohqsg
isn't he already 6 feet under,btohqsg
if you want to use deceased politicians for comparison references  there's a lot more...,btohqsg
i mean this guy whole life was political..theres nothing else that people could have known more about him which was not political,btohqsg
iirc biden was never credited solely for the work he did,btohqsg
he was at most just praised for how well he handles things in the political world,btohqsg
before he was president and the recent election,btohqsg
i mean his achievements changed america quite frankly,btohqsg
i meant  is biden the main creditor for any major or notable political work he did?,btohqsg
that many people would probably know of?,btohqsg
the first amendment?? is fucking useless by the way,btohqsg
He was the person that started the conversation about violence on women and wanting to create a law that better protected women. This law would later be known as the widely acclaimed violence against women act that was passed into law in 1994.Notably  it changed the complexion  understanding and outlook of laws which surronded the safety of women throughout america,btohqsg
Then another notable law which was passed because he started a conversation on it was the federal assault weapons ban. it was removed  but he has always advocated for it to reinstated. the act basically banned multiple variants of assault weapons from being in possesion of civillians,btohqsg
so yea there is those..but thats it  as far as i know. His time in politicis was just too long and too much for his own good,btohqsg
people who live too long in politics lose their true selves and almost impossibly cannot pick up their bits of their original personality of before entering politics,btohqsg
those were the good early (political) days of biden's,btohqsg
no idea  no further comment on that,btohqsg
@IcedMilo@pen_guiniithis guy has been repeatedly getting past the auto filtering for the past 2-3 hours,btohqsg
Will look into yhe auto filter,btohqsg
auto-filter on tele has been facing a bunch of bug-related issues sial,btohqsg
idk how do people get around that,btohqsg
either through copy-pasted fonts that appear pretty similar with the default in-app text formatting  case sensitive (highly-doubt so..) or some program that blocks the trigger when scammers send out unsolicited advertisment,btohqsg
algorithm & ai is still ultimately made by the human hands + brains  soo,btohqsg
technology still can't replace traditional humans,btohqsg
i hope no more jobs get replaced on grounds that ai will help better assist already existing job positions like data entry clerks,btohqsg
that's just wishful thinking from me but pls ðŸ¤ž,btohqsg
but it's humans' job to adapt to it and learn other skills,btohqsg
no more in a shorter run,btohqsg
but at least give more time for people to adapt to the use of ai skills being applied in work and literally daily life,btohqsg
people still struggle with emails and basic software tools at work,btohqsg
like those older generations aged people working,btohqsg
they can learn  yes but if they struggle then how,btohqsg
and taught by kids / younger generation people they know,btohqsg
i see my colleagues and other interns some outlook functions still dk,btohqsg
like some functions or features they aren't really versed with much familiarity  knowledge or use,btohqsg
