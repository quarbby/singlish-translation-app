Heymax is based on visa data point might have slight difference to mastercard. Can tag amaze to lady for small payment to know the mcc,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone has good recommendations for credit card that are good for mainly public transport (SimplyGo)  grocery and dining? Also  paying the usual home bills etcCan be cash back / miles cardCurrently using UOB one but a bit hard to hit the tiers sometimes ðŸ˜‚ and not very worth as some month hit 1k plus but cannot hit 2k tier cash rebates.,btohqsg
generally oversea spending in certain country (etc japan) might not be allocated as what is their business intended activities  so best to check mcc thru amaze by making small payment to verify.,btohqsg
Hi  wld appreciate feedback/improvements on my c.c strategyUOB Lady's Card (Travel) - Dedicated SpendUOB Privimiles -General Spend,btohqsg
really depend on your spending habit,btohqsg
just some heavy travel spending till end of the year,btohqsg
other than that just casual spending on the cards,btohqsg
"add UOB PPV for ""general spend""  if it's mobile contactless >$5 it's 4 mpd",btohqsg
there is a requirement for the card to be mobile contactless??,btohqsg
honeymoney got referral code for DOBIN?,btohqsg
where is it stated though? as i checked the website,btohqsg
sorry im referring to UOB Privi miles card,btohqsg
ya so Sylv is asking you to also consider UOB PPV,btohqsg
"Because Prvi is general spending  you could earn 4mpd on a ""specialised spending"" card like PPV",btohqsg
which is more than the 1.something on prvi,btohqsg
ohhh i cant apply PPV as they do not allow secured applications,btohqsg
dont get it by what u mean  after you are approved for first secured cc  you can apply for other uob card as well as uob cc shared same credit limit,btohqsg
After u get first secured card  login to uob ibank do online application.,btohqsg
ohhhh okay shall try it soon,btohqsg
They longer provide this option through paper form during secured application  but once u are approve secured credit card  can try to apply other uob cc in ibank as the card shared same credit limit,btohqsg
So the amount on the app is not the final amount posted?,btohqsg
The final amt use the posted one.,btohqsg
There's premier miles and prestige fcy transaction promo now. Should work since you mention heavy spending,btohqsg
Is amex sq business card 8.5mpd uncapped?,btohqsg
Guys  my OCBC titanium bonus points from September still not credited. Anyone having same issue? MCC was Apple,btohqsg
Hi can check useing amaze card pair with citi reward still got 4md ? Isit cap at 1k per month?,btohqsg

Was it approved or aborted? I applied 3x and pending UOB to get back to me,btohqsg
Amaze transaction now included the MCC can cross check it with heymax website,btohqsg
How long does a transaction take to be posted ?,btohqsg
depends on merchant  most take 2-3 days,btohqsg
mine was rejected the first time  bcos they used the salary info i submitted for another cc application years back (when my salary was less than 120k). had to do an online salary review and resubmit the application then it got approved after a few days. u can check ur application status using the reference number u received in ur email.,btohqsg
Is instagrem still a good option to use for payment?,btohqsg
yes if u mean instarem Amaze+appropriate mastercard or Amaze wallet,btohqsg
Yes. I do know it has extra fees now for medical. However I just scan a QR code to make payment at a restaurant  also got charge $0.50,btohqsg
hi   first time user of my new Citi rewards credit cardi like to buy something fromichangi.comso do i need to pair it with amaze to get 4x rewards ? any fee on amaze ?,btohqsg
can see the 4 digit mcc for the transaction in instarem app,btohqsg
7399 is one of the mcc that incur the 1% fee for local spend using Amaze+card,btohqsg
How to online submit salary review?,btohqsg
Have u all start using hey max app ? Does it work like shopback but it gives us miles instead ?,btohqsg
Hi for the new Webull account opening promo under Singsaver where funding 2k earns 140 sgd  it does not state how long the funds must be held in account...Does anyone know? Tk u!,btohqsg
Mine is in  but didnâ€™t have Apple,btohqsg

Anyone can confirm if hsbc Revolution card doesnâ€™t have 4mpd for SimplyGo usage? Thanks!,btohqsg
Last weekend uob down last last last posb down for hoursEvery week got down hahahaha,btohqsg
Any pro/guru can help  is it weird to have cash rebate and miles card combination?Looking at UOB one credit card (to maximise the UOB one account interest with tier $500 spending) and HSBC Revolution card for any other spending beyond uob one $500,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check if anyone had use atome installment with hsbc revolution card? Does it falls under eligible transaction?,btohqsg
Y not jus use uob lady which qualifies for the one acc interest as well? And focus solely on miles to accumulate faster?,btohqsg
Hmm. True that. Because using UOB one for utility bill as well for its cash back too. But very tired of having to spend consistently. HahahaNot very good at miles game yet but will this strategy work?1. UOB lady card - travel (SimplyGo  grab etc) since no minimum spend2. HSBC Revolution card - grocery  dining and other general expenses,btohqsg
The category for SimplyGo/Grab is Transport not Travel  I guess you just have to make sure your spending on utilities on uob one debit and transport on lady's is min $500,btohqsg
