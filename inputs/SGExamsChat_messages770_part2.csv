"i doubt ppl will even bother to stay back to ""play""",btohqsg
we setting up on the 2 days before,btohqsg
"24th april is the ""carnival"" day",btohqsg
I somehow got myself into planning comm for 3 events alrd over my time in jc ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
In preparation for the Earth Day (24 April)  we need you guys to stay back on 22 and 23 April to set up the booth and SEA. And on 24 April is the actual day (235 to 5 pm).,btohqsg
no idea wat SEA is lol,btohqsg
its just like carnival games each class has to make with reusable materials,btohqsg
bobian i had to choose for our class to make marble maze,btohqsg
"then the cher still wanted a ""instructional manual"" fpr how to play the game  a marble maze",btohqsg
idk how they wan us decorate,btohqsg
u r laughing at my expense ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
"""lol get used to being laughed at loser""",btohqsg
teachers become teachers because they love kids  is that wrong ðŸ¤¨,btohqsg
i mean teaching dont pay well  barely any career progression  def dont have flexible hours and cost a bunch of money to train to become one..so instinctively i guess the only reason someone would become a teacher is their love of kids,btohqsg
Why is this coming up again?,btohqsg
when we already mentioned teaching is actually highly viable,btohqsg
what other reason do you think teachers have for becoming teachers?,btohqsg
Dude since when did teaching pay very little,btohqsg
yes there's the liking kids part (dont take out of context),btohqsg
but in other countries they underpaid,btohqsg
my sec sch teacher says the pay is just enough to live comfortably,btohqsg
O ya recently poly lecturer pay has been up to $100/hr,btohqsg
highly viable? my teacher literally said  the kind of knowledge teachers acquire in order to teach students does not give them enough relevant skills or knowledge to partake in the industry they may have spent 2 decades as a teacher,btohqsg
My brain cannot process what u saying,btohqsg
im refering to teachers not lecturers or faci's,btohqsg
Kindergarten is low lvl kinda so,btohqsg
im asking u explain ur point lah,btohqsg
that's the whole issue with all industries,btohqsg
every industry need low lvl workers,btohqsg
like as kuro said if you scholar then def higherthen like tbh the same amount also mean different things to diff ppllike my y4 ft is single so she can afford all the branded goods and holidays to nice places with her own salarybut then if someone have kids and parent to support then maybe is just enough to live comfortably,btohqsg
Some parents making that amt at 40+ ah js a reminder,btohqsg
the teacher i was referencing taught principle of accounts for o levels. I asked him if he could get a job outside doing accounts with his relevant knowledge in the field,btohqsg
Nurses then we can argue abt that they rlly underpaid,btohqsg
They do a lot but not paid enough,btohqsg
Guys I think we shud just be sex workers,btohqsg
and willing to pay for u,btohqsg
Make people want u and willing to pay for u,btohqsg
Can you send the societys loss sticker,btohqsg
To be a sex slave for the saf,btohqsg
Getting fked in a diff way,btohqsg
Lets look objectively how much the avg teacher gets paid ig,btohqsg
Stepping stone to become tuition teacher,btohqsg
There's like ppl that actually choose decent paying job,btohqsg
but also ppl that choose sht paying,btohqsg
then complain abt how sht their pay is,btohqsg
When the same job in another company pays better,btohqsg
long service? Bro dont even look a tad over 30,btohqsg
but like if they cannot get the better paying job then maybe ah,btohqsg
