Dang  just now I received a push notification from citibank cc to approve a random $1000 transaction... Lucky I didn't approve.Should I block my cc?,btohqsg
Block the card immediately thru the app. I called citi afterwards to request for permanent block and replacement card. Happened to me last Sunday with Citi PM,btohqsg

How much do you expect to be spending? Is it a holiday or more day-to-day stuff?,btohqsg

can i pm u a link ?,btohqsg
That's one way to put some cpf OA away from rainy days ... Before hdb wipes out your OA for the hdb,btohqsg

Also  separate qn  can citi premier miles be paired with amaze  and use the amaze card for payment?,btohqsg
I saw the T&C if it‚Äôs just for food  groceries and shopping in a foreign country  should be can right?,btohqsg
U can pair but premier only give 1.2 mpd  wont cover the amaze spread,btohqsg
When u pair it is charge in sgd so consider local spend,btohqsg
Ahh I see so if I were to get a CC to be used overseas for shopping and day to day use what should I get?,btohqsg
Use uob visa signature up to 2k,btohqsg
Okay but because this is not a MC I can‚Äôt pair with amaze and would therefore be subjected to foreign conversion fees?,btohqsg
Yes but it is 4mpd still got net gain,btohqsg
People view 1 miles to be 1.5 cents usually. So 4mpd card is 5 percent cashback roughly. So after 3.25 fcy still get 1.75 net gain,btohqsg
Okay understand thank you for the detailed explaination,btohqsg
Sorry just wanted to do a sanity check.. for the UOB visa signature I can spend on any MCC when using foreign currency? Can‚Äôt seem to find the T&C for their whitelist/ blacklist,btohqsg
Usual exclusions. For dining & shopping so long can use contactless payment should be no prob,btohqsg
Oh the 4MPD is only entitled for contactless payment?,btohqsg
To be on the safe side as i used for max 2k transaction,btohqsg
No. Contactless  Petrol or FCY. 3 different categoriesRead this:https://milelion.com/2023/05/04/review-uob-visa-signature-card/,btohqsg
Thanks for the article  for the FCY category no blacklist MCC?,btohqsg
Exclusion applied as per tnc. But usual spending for fcy during travel should not be excluded,btohqsg
