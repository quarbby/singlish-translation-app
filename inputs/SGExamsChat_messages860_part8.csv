I think Singapore School just throw teachers a ThinkPad with built in stylus most of the time.,btohqsg
that time happens only when Windows successfully transition to ARM.And Intel and AMD lost dominant market share.,btohqsg
But then I suspect if Windows is fully ARM based   is not going to work well,btohqsg
Most programs won't work I think,btohqsg
>> Can see how well Microsoft Store turned out. /heh/,btohqsg
Still quite a long road ahead given even macos also has compatibility issues with some software,btohqsg
so far only Apple was the successful ones.That transitioned from Intel Mac to Apple Silicon (ARM),btohqsg
I mostly concerned what kind of program to run if Windows fully uses arm cpu,btohqsg
I kinda love x86 for flexibility but unfortunately as you mentioned  it use battery power real fast,btohqsg
yea wacom is meant for professionals,btohqsg
or people really into digital art,btohqsg
there are much more affordable options out there like Huion,btohqsg
saw Wacom One (2023) have a screen for about USD$300.The pens abit thin  but review generally good.But if you malas get a laptop + tablet.Just get an iPad.,btohqsg
i used to use a huion when i did commissions,btohqsg
iPad is a favourite for one reason only,btohqsg
i get paid to draw stuff,btohqsg
kewl got portfolio of some of your artwork?,btohqsg
i do but that's not smth i reveal online,btohqsg
bc it's separate from my irl stuff,btohqsg
i mean if your artwork is good  or decent I mean can always throw it into Cypto NFTs who knew you become a millionaire overnight.,btohqsg
do you use or spend time on your own artwork to be used in your Research papers publications?,btohqsg
i do use my art software to help with some of my figures yea,btohqsg
For me if I got huion or wacom drawing monitors   I might have ideas of making Khan academy style videos,btohqsg
I think very rare  so far the nicer ones maybe MinuteEarth/MinutePhysics style videos.,btohqsg
if i ever wanted to do videos like that  i'd learn to animate like 3blue1brown,btohqsg
So far the nicer A-Level Biology ones I found out recently was some Malaysian Youtuber do free lectures :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rSP0qlBtMQ&ab_channel=OtterBioTutorBro very well planned his drawings then re-recording and speed-up his annimation to fit his audio recordings.,btohqsg
heard that one kinda involves alot of Python coding?But I think should be easier now. Since ChatGPT/DeepSeek is here,btohqsg
yea he uses a python package he developed,btohqsg
idk how well chatgpt would do with that though,btohqsg
getting them to give code that really animates the way you envision it isn't easy,btohqsg
need to checkout MidJourney or whatnot. Prompt Animation Coding seems like a regular thing now.,btohqsg
I think the latest one is called Sora.,btohqsg
hmm idk  for me if i made a video to educate,btohqsg
i really want it to look and flow in a specific way,btohqsg
to achieve that  i think just learning to code it would be easier,btohqsg
I mean if you know what you're coding that's fine I guess haha,btohqsg
I guess she need to buy the tools needed for jc first,btohqsg
GC  books  and other miscellaneous tools needed for jc,btohqsg
I think main issue is how to get admission to NTU/NUS Dental.I presume you need atleast straights As to even enroll lol.,btohqsg
also Singapore doesn't recognize 3rd world country Dental Degrees. lol,btohqsg
https://www.healthprofessionals.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider11/announcements/dra-schedule_list-of-registrable-basic-dental-qualifications-(current-and-revised-wef-1jan2029).pdf?sfvrsn=3de2f905_0Seems like mostly 95%+ is angmo country. Left Hong Kong is the only recognized left lol.,btohqsg
But the salary you earn from dentist is good. Some can stay sentosa buying condo and porsche üòÅ,btohqsg
I thought NTU only has MBBS,btohqsg
hihi offtopic but does anyone know anywhere that sells owala coz all my classmates say its good and i shld buy,btohqsg
get strainless bottles. not plastic ones.,btohqsg
looks very plastic at the exterior lol,btohqsg
uhhhhh shopee sell  the official store  i think taka also have,btohqsg
but most people use the metal one,btohqsg
Waste of money if u ask me,btohqsg
plastic bottle is bad for u,btohqsg
