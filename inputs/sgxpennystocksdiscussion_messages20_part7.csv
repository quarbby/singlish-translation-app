"Medtecs International: Technical interpretationüëáMedtecs chart has somewhat achieved the basic golden rules on ""buy on dip""  ie1) The chart is still uptrending;2) Fibonacci retracement show that is has moved almost toward the 50% Fibo retracement  and possibly toward 61.8% Fibo retracement  which is known as the golden ratio;3) Stochastic show that it has move toward the oversold region4) It has retraced approximately toward the EMA-50.Therefore   good price to enter is between 0.815 and 1.034.This is purely a technical interpretation.  Fundamentals are not factored.  DYODD!(Note: The ‚Äúgolden ratio‚Äù concept is developed by Fred Tam of F1 Academy)",btohqsg

Glove is not difficult. The tech is there  resources  connections  demands are all there.,btohqsg
If being new = failure  we wont see Xiaomi or Huawei being popular against Apple in technology today already.,btohqsg
Keep it up if you think so. First  u already acknowledged last time your shortfalls might have led to losses as got caught  no self-denial. Second  u learnt from the past and manage risk better now. 3. Third  don‚Äôt let negative comments esp unsubstantiated affect u. Really  the true enemy when we play stock mkt is ourselves  not shortists  BB  syndicates etc. If you know yourself truely well  no one can really point a gun at your head to buy or sell.,btohqsg

For Aspen war not over but their margin will be less than established players which moreover will have tons of cash by then..,btohqsg
River stone top glove UG healthcare don‚Äôt sign MOU deal,btohqsg
Anyways  I forwarded this proper analysis into the other sg stocks huat group and then was banned and kicked. Very likely many of you guys are in there as well as they have added you guys in.For me to be kicked and banned is totally uncalled for and the fact that  he copied furion post as his own to alleviate himself in his group.Honestly  I have nothing to say. That‚Äôs all. Just feel really disgusted.,btohqsg
