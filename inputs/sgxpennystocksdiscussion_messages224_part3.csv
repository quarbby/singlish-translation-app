Top Glove‚Äôs suspensionON Wednesday  Top Glove Corp Bhd suspended the trading of its shares for reasons that remain unknown until now.The suspension lasted for a brief one hour period and all the company mentioned was that the action was related to its announcements a day before.No further elaboration was given.The announcements a day before the suspension was a stock exchange filing in which the company‚Äôs founder and executive chairman Tan Sri Lim Wee Chai had purchased an additional 3.29 million shares in the company.Lim forked out an average price of RM6.07 per share  which amounts to a total average purchase cost of RM20mil.With the additional shares  Lim‚Äôs total stake in Top Glove rose to 34.82%  comprising a direct and indirect equity interest of 26.2% and 8.62% respectively.One possible reason for the share suspension could be related to the concern of whether Lim had triggered a mandatory takeover of Top Glove.It should be noted that Lim has held more than 33% of Top Glove for some time  which means that the concern is not so much about triggering that 33% threshold but whether he had breached the creeping rule  which stipulates that such shareholders are not allowed to increase their stakes by more than 2% every six months.Otherwise  why would the shares of Top Glove be suspended  albeit for a mere one hour?Hopefully  more clarity on this matter will be revealed either by the company or the regulator so as to erase any doubts that market participants have on the suspension of the company‚Äôs shares.,btohqsg
