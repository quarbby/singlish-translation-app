The thing is it’s fucking every 2 weeks book out,btohqsg
I suppose I shall be enjoying the stay out life soon,btohqsg
Its the 2 weeks in 2 weeks out crap?,btohqsg

Fuck if I bunk in with recruits I also 2230 lights out,btohqsg

A total lockdown will be more effective,btohqsg
But even so  due to the dorm clusters appearing recently  number of cases the next few days are bound to surge,btohqsg
Yeah gotta wait for like 2 weeks to see if its effective,btohqsg
By right more than 2 weeks,btohqsg
Hence i understand why this lasts for a month,btohqsg
