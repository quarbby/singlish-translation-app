Hi! Would like to know the standpoint for people who have or are buying BTO house.1. Pay via CPF VS Bank Loan2. If CPF- to pay as much as possible with all the CPF + cash or to keep 20K CPF remaining3. Do you max out the 30 year loan period or to pay finish everything as fast as possible?,btohqsg
Current prevailing interest rate  but I was advised against to do so by customer service cos:- Money locked in for as long as you have the card- Secured Credit Limit will be lower apparently- Goes using prevailing interest rates,btohqsg
For UOB EVOL  to earn the cash back the transaction must be posted within the statement month ?,btohqsg

For big tour packages travel expenses (above 20k) isit better to used1) UOB Lady Solitair for miles or2) UOB Absolute for the cashback3) UOB Krisflyer CC + UOB Krisflyer Account.I’m assuming payment via travel agency counts towards the solitaire criteria,btohqsg
May I know where can I find this announcement?,btohqsg
They sent an email to all existing customers with existing recurring payments. Chat with their staff and confirmed the above.,btohqsg
Ok I’ll wait for the email. Haven’t received it yet,btohqsg

You should receive the acknowledgment email  no confirmation. You will only know in Mar whether it’s successful. Deposit will be earmarked and cash gift credited if it’s successful.,btohqsg
I've noticed usually..the 4th week upon submission..credit in + lockin will start...just a guage..fyi,btohqsg

As long as you hit the criteria as stated in tnc  your money will be earmarked in March.,btohqsg
Currently considering EU  Chan and SA,btohqsg
If there is plenty of time before travel think they allow payment of deposit amt first and rest can slowly pay. So i will spilt charge the card to enjoy the full mile each month,btohqsg
My understanding is:1).Avoidusing UOB Krisflyer2).Don’tpay via Kris+ pay.If agency allowed  pay $1 to test out the mcc code first. If it is mcc 4722  pay S$3k per month across few months using Lady.,btohqsg
Chan Brother confirm can.You just need to pay the downpayment firstThen you can monthly contact the relevant country team to email you Red Dot payment links.I have been using that to max out my UOB Lady Travel category.,btohqsg
Does down payment consider as well?,btohqsg
chan brother (NON KRIS+) is all 4722... at shop and red dot online,btohqsg
May I ask what is red dot payment?,btohqsg
payment facilitator that chan brother uses to collect payment online,btohqsg
Why can’t pay via kris+ pay though? Isit cause payment via kris+ doesn’t qualify as a travel category?,btohqsg
Chan Brother (Kris+) is not 4722 MCC,btohqsg
