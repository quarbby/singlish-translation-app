U mean at least 2K  no 5 dollars charge right,btohqsg
Hi gurus  for OCBC 360 account Spend criteria of charging $500 to OCBC credit card  does topping up $500 to youtrip fulfill the spend criteria since they only mention charging the amount to the credit card.,btohqsg
I’m falling back on Amex true cash back with Amex pay,btohqsg

Hi  anyone encounter this problem for registering with Amex pay?,btohqsg
Suggestion was to reinstall the app,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if I can link my credit card to my family members’ Instarem Amaze card?  Or card owner can only link to own self’s credit card?,btohqsg
icic! thank you! will read up more! :),btohqsg
Any idea what will happen if U don't keep $100k in UOB account under their wealth banking ?,btohqsg
Hsbc everyday + $300 for Apr 2024 credited already? Should be every 5th of the month right?,btohqsg
Privilege or wealth? For privilege  i only got 50 or few hundred bucks insai  for years liao 🤣,btohqsg
I guess wealth is when they really enforce it,btohqsg
Hi is xnap still available for hawker centre and coffee shop payment?,btohqsg
been down for 2 weeks  hope it will be up again,btohqsg
Thanks for this info. I was wondering when they will earmark the sum as I have done the transfer.,btohqsg
On Kris+ (Kris pay miles)  I just discovered a whole chunk expired on 1st May without notification or me knowing it. 🤦‍♀️So what is the recommendation from you guys? Better to offset purchases?,btohqsg
Clear out during miles promo for ntuc vouchrr,btohqsg
Usually there's a warning for it when it's expiring though... Personally i always transfer when i earn KPM (Krisplay miles)If its untransferrable balance from promo etc. I would clock it up for NTUC Voucher when there's promo (else cash out via purchase/voucher),btohqsg
Thanks folks.Learnt my lesson  will keep a lookout for ntuc voucher promo,btohqsg
Trying to understand how this promo works. I just got my new account in MAY  so basically 0 balance in APR. Say i xfer fresh fund of 50k today  it will earn the bonus interest for 2 mths in MAY  and JUN?Or will i only earn the bonus rate in May  since the MAB is the same in JUN and May.Thanks,btohqsg
1) SMS register for the promo  earn 3.35% on May and Jun MAB (wrt to Apr MAB which is $0) and2) Transfer in $2k/$5k and do 5 transactions (e.g. FAST transfer to other bank)  earn 1% on incremental MAB wrt previous month,btohqsg
Ah i see. So regards to APR my MAB is 0  if i fufill point 2  i get the bonus interest and also the rewards 1% in May. But no extra rewards 1% in Jun as no increment compare to previous mth. Thanks.Best thing is just to removed the fund at end of jun?,btohqsg
You can always register in May and deposit on 1 Jun. May is already 1 week in,btohqsg
Wont i lose the bonus interest in May this way?,btohqsg
Unless your 50k is in an account that earns you less than 3.64% p.a.  you'd rather not touch this amount for now. Assuming you haven't transferred the money in yet.,btohqsg
Or wait for the promo next mth for Jun and July. Keep the account as 0 for the month of May,btohqsg
If you only have just 50k in that account  then actually it's better to move it since it's only earning you 3% p.a.,btohqsg
There's no guarantee that their promo is gonna give the same rate.,btohqsg
Sounds great. Actually just got my ega approve 2days ago. Thus slightly late. The time i should remove my fund is on 1st july yea? Thanks.Oh i have seen smth on controlling 2 human account for ega or smth but cant really find an explaination on that,btohqsg
Yup.The 1% as you previously mentioned have answered yourself.,btohqsg
If u have 2 humans u can move the funds out to an outside account and immediately to the other human between months.Then u can always earn the 1% incremental bonus.,btohqsg
Actually 2 human also hard to do right  cos of the reference month? If I do this month may   my other human next month June  then July I do  Aug he can't do liao right.. Assuming promo continue,btohqsg
Nope. If u control 2 humans it is assured u will get almost the max bonus interest + incremental interest for up to $360k.JanHuman A do with December reference monthFebHuman b do with January reference monthMarchHuman a do with February reference month.,btohqsg
Just make sure you only register each human in the bonus (SMS in) cycle when ready to start.Eg in above example human B only registers for the 3.x% promo in February.,btohqsg
It works easily now because Hsbc bonus interest cycle is always 2 months from reference month nowHuman A = jan Feb bonusReference month DecemberHuman b = February March bonusReference month January,btohqsg

Hi  any ways to topup Shopeepay and earn CC rewards?,btohqsg
Can I ask why only android phone?,btohqsg
So far most CC impossible to do that,btohqsg
Because Kris+ uses google pay or apple pay. Amaze card only supports google pay atm  hence android phone.,btohqsg
So you link amaze to kris+,btohqsg
no  link Amaze card to googlepay  scan kris+ QR using kris+ app and pay using google pay  select Amaze card,btohqsg
Thanks so much  we always register same month,btohqsg
Haha then the ADB for one of the account always maxed out.. best to register different,btohqsg
Have to adapt with their tnc modifications. Last time yes when Hsbc EGA was for 3 months then both humans register in same month. Then both humans rest one month (all move to scb esaver to cool down).Now because they play punk and change to 2 months. To avoid having issues in month 3 since month 2 will have big adb  have to stagger the registration months.,btohqsg
I find it easiest and clearest to use excel to track. So u won’t lose focus on the reference month and Lugi.,btohqsg
One more thing to note is if you've registered for last month EGA bonus interest campaign  this month you will not be eligible (it says in the registration SMS). So register only when you have the funds.,btohqsg
this month seems like everyone's offering 3.5% (OCBC  Stand Chart  HSBC). I find Stand Chart to be the least troublesome to fulfill,btohqsg
How long do we need to keep the 250k inside citi ?,btohqsg
