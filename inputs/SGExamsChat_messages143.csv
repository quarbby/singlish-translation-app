im more of an enterprising / artistic / social person,btohqsg
I often do badly as well. Can't understand JC lectures. So what?,btohqsg
no wonder you use trad chinese,btohqsg
JC notes are so alien to me,btohqsg
Nope. Both can't even read chinese,btohqsg
I grew up in mainland china,btohqsg
close to shanghai i only know hangzhou XD,btohqsg
Nope. My father works for someone. Not that rich  hahaha,btohqsg
oh then still biz purpose la,btohqsg
ya but i dun liek math anymore üò∞,btohqsg
higher level math study instilled fear in me,btohqsg
used to like it i guess,btohqsg
my ex math teacher straight up screamed at us everyday during lesson,btohqsg
not a lesson goes by without screaming,btohqsg
I never held a chinese passport. Neither did my parents,btohqsg
nooo i just watch many chinese shows,btohqsg
glad to know someone that likes chinese as well,btohqsg
oh ya JC kids! yall choose specific subject combination only after orientation right?,btohqsg
too long nvr study chinese alr,btohqsg
yeahhh  and i can read trad chinese bcs i watched too much taiwanese shows (ch8 weekends 8pm) when i was a kid,btohqsg
That was the past  when the o level results don't come out quickly enough,btohqsg
ohh is it yall can enter the jc to experience before os results are out?,btohqsg
i rmb hearing about this before,btohqsg
why everyone in the pic look so ‰πñ,btohqsg
guys anyone learning foreign lang here,btohqsg
is there chances to learn foreign lang in jc? üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
cuz i trying to learn 2 at the same time damn hard,btohqsg
if you don't have O level foreign lang,btohqsg
i think got h1 french or sth,btohqsg
i know NP have but i wont be in NP anymore :(,btohqsg
Yes but only if approved by MOE as the language in lieu of MTL,btohqsg
Foe example I had a classmate who took hindi,btohqsg
She went to a school in little india,btohqsg
Her parents are hindi  that's why,btohqsg
If you have a French student they can take french,btohqsg
im learning french and russian and i swear to god i wan die liao,btohqsg
dun even have sch rn  oso like damn tough,btohqsg
Or if some singaporean lived in france,btohqsg
No exposure to Chinese  malay tamil,btohqsg
i wanna try learning german XD,btohqsg
focus on 1 language first uh,btohqsg
I want to learn these two languages!!!,btohqsg
ya i prob gonna ditch one,btohqsg
Oh  so you want to do business in the former Soviet countries?,btohqsg
Immigrate to Russia I think is not easy,btohqsg
migrating to china is the easiest,btohqsg
And I understand there can be a lot of racism,btohqsg
migrating to china & taiwan is my dream sia,btohqsg
Citizenship very hard to obtain without blood ties,btohqsg
thats why im learning how to write in trad chinese XD,btohqsg
ROC is easier. PRC is super difficult,btohqsg
I can read trad chinese but idk how to write :/,btohqsg
And ROC recognises dual nationality. PRC doesn't,btohqsg
its q hard for me ü•¥,btohqsg
Most mainland chinese can read it in general,btohqsg
so it's kind of useless tbh,btohqsg
Actually legally a lot of Singaporeans are ROC nationals without Taiwan hukou,btohqsg
reading is easy but writing it is another thing XD,btohqsg
In order to become taiwanese  you need ROC nationality and Taiwan household registration,btohqsg
Otherwise  you need an entry permit to taiwan,btohqsg
National does not give you right of abode,btohqsg
Right of abode means right to live there permanently,btohqsg
It has been in place since ancient times,btohqsg
Because taiwan is under republic of china control,btohqsg
Not independent from china currently  under the constitution,btohqsg
Until they declare independence it is still ROC goverened,btohqsg
Currently  there are two governments that claim to represent china,btohqsg
Kinmen is controlled by the ROC,btohqsg
I mean  the KMT fled to taiwan,btohqsg
And tungsha islands in the south china sea,btohqsg
Yes  and until the early 2000s everyone must say one china,btohqsg
i didnt know the islands are controlled by ROC,btohqsg
Let me show you an ROC press release,btohqsg
In 2001  they must say  Êù•Âçé,btohqsg
I'm not too sure. But now they say Êù•Âè∞,btohqsg
The full embassies in taipei are called È©ªÂçéÂ§ß‰ΩøÈ¶Ü,btohqsg
Meaning embassies to china. Not taiwan,btohqsg
Interesting fact: the ROC and the DPRK use the same calendar year officially. DPRK uses the Juche calendar,btohqsg
Because both calendars start from 1912,btohqsg
ROC starts from the founding of the ROC. Juche starts from the birth year of Kim Il Sung,btohqsg
you seem very passionate about Chinese history,btohqsg
yeah man you know so much!!,btohqsg
take up CSC  i think you'll like the subject a lot,btohqsg
Hmmm... ROC used to be a military dictatorship,btohqsg
i wanted to take CSC or CSE  but the jc i wanna enter doesnt offer it anymore :(,btohqsg
i know chiang kai shek attempted to make himself the emperor for a v short period of time before,btohqsg
tmjc  my nett is 12 their cop this year is 13  i hope i can enter :///,btohqsg
The old Singapore passports at certain points of time were not valid for PRC or ROC,btohqsg
ahhh  jpjc is out immediately LOL,btohqsg
Hahaha  new JC that didn't exist during my time,btohqsg
but tbh im fine wif entering yijc,btohqsg
Used to be called just PJC and JJC,btohqsg
YIJC hahaha. So weird listening to it now. Not used to it,btohqsg
I wanted to go jjc because it was damn close to my house,btohqsg
but bam  they announced the merger,btohqsg
IJC used to be a 19/20 pointer JC. Not sure about now,btohqsg
den which jc did u enter in the end?,btohqsg
YIJC 20 for both streams this year,btohqsg
i checked the cop for jc 2020 from sgexams reddit XD,btohqsg
Oh  so they pulled down YJC. interesting,btohqsg
so it made much more sense to merge them together,btohqsg
I know. But I think it still makes a difference,btohqsg
it was the same for anderson and serangoon jc,btohqsg
now ASR is 11 for both,btohqsg
ASR  hahaha  weird to my ears,btohqsg
yea I like to call it AJ,btohqsg
ASR q far from my hse tho,btohqsg
i gotta change 2 mrt lines man,btohqsg
SAJC is 11 also i think,btohqsg
im afraid i cant even enter tmjc xp,btohqsg
choose whichever sch that suits your interest,btohqsg
if you like CSC  go to a jc that offers CSC,btohqsg
"my fam asked me ""are u sure u can enter jc??"" i was like ""hMMM not 100% sure but yeahhhh"" üò´üò´",btohqsg
I heard horror stories from MJC...,btohqsg
Not sure if TMJC is like that,btohqsg
i attended some intro section to ËØ≠Áâπwhen i was sec 4,btohqsg
and I believe it can definitely bring you somewhere,btohqsg
did you get A1 for chinese,btohqsg
TJC's cop too low for me üò´üò´,btohqsg
yes but i didnt take higher chinese in sec sch cuz NA,btohqsg
TJ arts is like 11 points right,btohqsg
hmmmm lemme check  i tot its below 10 de,btohqsg
my cca record isnt v good XD,btohqsg
ËØ≠Áâπ lets you -2 from your L1R5,btohqsg
oh ya TJ 's 10 for arts,btohqsg
i didnt take third language XD,btohqsg
i forgot about the details of ËØ≠Áâπ  will go & research soon,btohqsg
you just have to opt for it when you're submitting your JAE form,btohqsg
TJC's isnt near my hse tho üò´üò´,btohqsg
bus 87 but its q far to me,btohqsg
I heard TJC makes students work till 10 or something? Those who aren't that great in exams,btohqsg
At least that was how it was so long ago,btohqsg
yeah tjc's has a mugging culture right,btohqsg
I heard CJC is very welcoming. Cares so much for students,btohqsg
tbh tm and tj are so close to each other,btohqsg
Although I can't really share some of the stories. But really sad stories and CJC really helped these students,btohqsg
TM is at pasir ris wdym,btohqsg
ok tru bedok & pasir ris are q near to each other,btohqsg
There was one story on TV. A malaysian student stuck in Malaysia. CJC helped the student apply for special permission to enter Singapore,btohqsg
So that he could take exams and attend classes normally,btohqsg
I just checked the travelling time,btohqsg
from your area to tj it takes about 1h plus LOL,btohqsg
but to tm it's 30 minutes,btohqsg
Yes  apparently arrange all the accomodation and everything,btohqsg
the sch management team rlly cares for their students man!,btohqsg
"tmjc is really nice :"") i enjoyed my time here a lot :D",btohqsg
from hougang to bedok alr like 20 minutes  then need wait for 38 as well,btohqsg
he takes bus to changi then from there change bus to go tanah merah then change again,btohqsg
its multiple changes  but its faster,btohqsg
I know someone that was forced to work until 10pm. Because I met him outside TJC at 10. But that was 2014? 2015? Can't exactly remember,btohqsg
wasn't the case last year either,btohqsg
night study at most ended at 8,btohqsg
but you had to be extraordinarily underperforming,btohqsg
Hi can I check anyone can help with ib history;-;?,btohqsg
Oh  they have probably changed the system. That's good.,btohqsg
Singapore taught me that things other than studying is important. Have a work-life balance. Study effectively  not a lot but ineffectively.,btohqsg
Well  Sengkang used to be much smaller. Sengkang keeps expanding...They took over Seletar East Farmway in the early 2000s and now they want the West Farmway as well... Dug up part of Jalan Kayu...,btohqsg
Nice thanks for the history hahah,btohqsg
Butbut I nid like old history not within singapore,btohqsg
Anyone can help w CMC owon,btohqsg
It used to be so quiet... Until the roads mostly changed to something unrecognisable.,btohqsg
Construction equipment just came in and bulldozed so much,btohqsg
The four digit postal codes used until 1995,btohqsg
Jalan Kayu and the current 'Sengkang West',btohqsg
i take buses to TPE  den 168 all the way to bedok,btohqsg
Isn't there 969(highway)? It is 4 stops to tampines then you can trnfr to ew line to Bedok haha.,btohqsg
too lazy to take the mrt üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
"The stop is called ""after punggol rd""",btohqsg
They don't sell these books anymore,btohqsg
If they published a newer version I would have used it,btohqsg
maybe the boldened TPE is the stop,btohqsg
This just says express on TPE,btohqsg
but the trip takes 1 hr anyway  so might as well take 87 from the beginning HAHA,btohqsg
i was in 5na last year,btohqsg
actually on second thought this mildly makes sensecan take 38 from there straight to front gate,btohqsg
Is it normal for like mcq to have  consecutive 6 same letter? ;-; damn paranoid cuz of it,btohqsg
Yes  economics is actually a social science,btohqsg
If it is in the school internal exams  possible. Some schools seem to enjoy doing stuff like that,btohqsg
Maybe not 6 but quite a number,btohqsg
Then u go study it have a lot of math also,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs be real geog and econs fake arts,btohqsg
It cant really be considered a social science if theres a truckload of math in uni econs,btohqsg
I know. I heard that in university it is a lot of applied mathematics and statistics. That's why I don't take economics. I strongly dislike statistics,btohqsg
I mean that‚Äôs why H1 math is a prerequisite,btohqsg
That's because in university that teach economics from scratch. And i understand a lot of A level economics is watered down and too obssessed with theoretical concepts  which university economics apparently isn't,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just arts coz of the exam,btohqsg
a level econs is only useful for the v first econs mod u do in uni,btohqsg
They dont even teach from scratch in NUS lol,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs remove Econs‚Äô status as an arts subject so noob science kids can‚Äôt get away with using a fake arts as a contrasting subject,btohqsg
1st sem alr have math calculus mods in econs alongisde a refresher a lvl econs mod,btohqsg
"The ""from scratch knoweldge for econs"" mod is negligible",btohqsg
Then geog should also be removed,btohqsg
So GELm kids are in fact science students,btohqsg
Isn't 'Refresher A levels economics' teaching from scratch  albeit quickly?,btohqsg
Is probably more of a skim through the syllabus,btohqsg
Because I suppose most of what is taught in A levels is not so relevant later?,btohqsg
Imagine learning h2 econs in 12 weeks,btohqsg
Do u think is any useful?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not it‚Äôs not relevant more of it‚Äôs too basic bah,btohqsg
Essentially whatever econs knowledge u learnt in jc is false/pointless,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs be real all A level subjects like that,btohqsg
Is not a social science  period.,btohqsg
Whatever u learn in JC is just basic or is just oversimplified for u,btohqsg
That's what I mean  at least from what I heard from people,btohqsg
That's what an economics graduate told me,btohqsg
Everything in primary school is basic  secondary is harder,btohqsg
Said it was a social science,btohqsg
Yea plus exam style is probably different,btohqsg
OhBut i have a current friend in nus econs,btohqsg
Everything in secondary is basic  JC harder,btohqsg
Everything in JC basic  uni harder,btohqsg
Everything in uni basic  grad school harder,btohqsg
nus econs is a bachelor of social sciences though,btohqsg
Ofc  cos it falls under FASS,btohqsg
Depends what 'social science' means to you,btohqsg
In reality is a science subject,btohqsg
I would argue it's more science that abstract mathematics,btohqsg
Yea let‚Äôs be real people go to economist ask for the stats first,btohqsg
Rather than the social science aspect of it,btohqsg
If u class things under ‚Äòapplied maths‚Äô  nothing will escape this umbrella,btohqsg
Social science aspect is a complement to the stats,btohqsg
A level statistics made me run far far away from statistics as a whole,btohqsg
Probability theory is not really statistics,btohqsg
I learnt that in measure theory,btohqsg
A lvl statistics is a joke,btohqsg
Even easier than o lvl a maths,btohqsg
FM stats easier than H2 math stats,btohqsg
Nope. I used to not understand a word of it,btohqsg
I had to force myself to learn it,btohqsg
Is because of h2 math statistics thats why GER1000 is currently very bearable,btohqsg
Wilcoxon the only thing that is preventing me from not using MF26,btohqsg
But I would admit it has uses,btohqsg
It's useful  but I hate it,btohqsg
It‚Äôs easier than all the PnC shit,btohqsg
At least in the FM scenario,btohqsg
I mean uni stats has proofs meanwhile A level is just all application,btohqsg
I've seen the proofs. Sorry  not for me ..,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I think he said it‚Äôs a joke,btohqsg
Really just manipulation here and there,btohqsg
If u see FM stats maybe u also think it‚Äôs a joke coz it‚Äôs just GC fiesta,btohqsg
I see the word 'thermal'  my brain switches off,btohqsg
But I find it hard to understand,btohqsg
A level refresher course become MCQ,btohqsg
the v first mod in nus is all mcq,btohqsg
U may need full marks for an A,btohqsg
If u get 29/30 is a B instantly,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok A levels 0 MCQ,btohqsg
mcq 5 options sometimes not fun leh,btohqsg
some of the options are super close,btohqsg
Learnt knot theory while on exchange,btohqsg
When I went on exchange my lecturers quickly went on strike,btohqsg
And then straight after it was shut because of the pandemic,btohqsg
Angry about pensions. But they are happy with their salary though,btohqsg
All my lecturers went on strike for fourteen days,btohqsg
Confirm have a lot of people one,btohqsg
Singapore used to have strikes. Not really anymore,btohqsg
Nobody wants to fuck with the law,btohqsg
It's sad. Also a lot of content was cut from the exam,btohqsg
Yep  the Jones Polynomial is Field's Medal mathematics,btohqsg
I took it while on exchange. In the UK. It is considered a year 3 course  usually done by graduating students,btohqsg
That's why it is important to differentiate Riemann integration from the others when claiming that something is not integrable. The Cantor set is really interesting,btohqsg
Some random person really sat down and said let's prove 10 paragraphs of mathematics,btohqsg
For Lebesgue integration  it should be Lesbegue himself. It is not really a proof  but more of coming up with this.I checked about the Cantor set  it was discovered by someone called Henry John Stephen Smith  but introduced by the famous mathematician Georg Cantor,btohqsg
Not random. Geniuses essentially. It's not 10 paragraphs. It is a bunch of scribbled handwriting that is later translated into a academic paper or a letter or something. Mathematicians are known for their poor handwriting,btohqsg
Thinking about this  I'm not even sure if today's education system can effectively nurture geniuses.,btohqsg
If you're not in ENS I don't think you can make good judgment on it,btohqsg
Anyway I think there could be headway into complexity classes (in terms of recent math),btohqsg
Though the most recent negative result was disappointing,btohqsg
It is a shame that u don‚Äôt want to,btohqsg
guys does poly grades affect JC admission? (poly-jc),btohqsg
u want transfer from poly to JC?,btohqsg
But if u appeal outside JAE  then maybe the school will consider your poly grades,btohqsg
u can choose not to even if you'reextraordinarily underperforming,btohqsg
is night study a thing in all jcs?,btohqsg
most JCs have their libraries open until 9-10pm,btohqsg
but honestly idt teachers wld make u stay until night time,btohqsg
How to deal with post prelim depression,btohqsg
I have such low confidence when i do my chem tdy,btohqsg
u dont  it only goes away after it ends ;-;,btohqsg
idh prelims so i cant give much advice but just do ur best i guess  don't focus on the grades but focus on your progress and give urself some time,btohqsg
grow to not focus on ur grades and seek for small improvements every exam instead,btohqsg
Idk i do all the time,btohqsg
I have never seen any of my grades,btohqsg
Including A levels from a number of years back,btohqsg
If my em or am get B i will be damn depress,btohqsg
It is like the bad feeling you get after a certaim exam,btohqsg
It's ok to get depress over ur B grade  but just don't let others know about it,btohqsg
Because it might make them depress as well,btohqsg
It's fine if you get B. You know you've tried your best. I know it sounds clich√©d but you have tried and it's over. Move on with life. It's not the end,btohqsg
Last time I would think it's the end. A levels taught me that it's never the end,btohqsg
And there are people doing worse also bah. So rather than complain about what u could not achieve  be grateful about what u manage to achieve,btohqsg
last year i tot Os is the end,btohqsg
Honestly I don't think A levels is so stressful. I can't speak for O levels but it should be more stressful with more subjects,btohqsg
i wish i cld get B,btohqsg
No haha  o level stress is almost nothing compared a level stress imo,btohqsg
O level stress comes from having to study many subjects many papers  is like marathon,btohqsg
A level stress comes from degree of complexity,btohqsg
alevels harder than o levels if im not wrong,btohqsg
and alevels also got alot of content,btohqsg
I was really enjoying project work,btohqsg
But O levels have so many more subjects than a lebel,btohqsg
I like to focus on a few subjects  not a little bit from all over the place,btohqsg
Ya and more complexIf never seriously study  its difficult to scrape thru,btohqsg
At least o level can anyhow scrape thru and still get decent grades,btohqsg
i went from N to O levels so many teachers around me made Os seem v scary,btohqsg
Many teachers make A levels sound scary,btohqsg
Ya hahaha üòÇ this is the breather among the other subjects,btohqsg
I can tell you that is not true in most cases,btohqsg
he never got an A until he did A levels,btohqsg
Yes cos is content heavy tooIt is no joke! But memory work can help alotA levels must fully understand  more difficult,btohqsg
They dun even have toü§£ it is originally scary alr,btohqsg
O lvls and a lvls big diff,btohqsg
He suddenly kai qiao is it,btohqsg
When I do prelim papers  I don‚Äôt count marks,btohqsg
Yes  I never never seen my A levels results,btohqsg
But I have never gone to the level of not seeing my exam marks,btohqsg
Ur personality like to focus on one thing n analyze deep deep is it,btohqsg
YAAA they encourage us to enter pfp or dpp instead,btohqsg
How do you enter uni then,btohqsg
the internal sch pprs are q hard tbh,btohqsg
Hahaha??? Never seen any of ur grades why??,btohqsg
Ask my parents to fill up the form. Got accepted by Ntu within 48 hours. NUS within a week. Not that hard...,btohqsg
wait till 2025 they change the whole exam,btohqsg
Because I developed depression in JC.,btohqsg
yeah! my principal showed us the stats in jan  average l1r4 was 21 for the previous batch,btohqsg
Maybe cos it will affect sch ranking and cut off point,btohqsg
And I am still depressed till this day,btohqsg
l was q upset at my teachers :x,btohqsg
That's why I say  don't emphasise too much on grades,btohqsg
Oh ok. Ya that justifies greatly,btohqsg
Not academics. Something else that I won't discuss here. I transferred JC as a result,btohqsg
Less Sec 5s = Less students to handle,btohqsg
"they kept emphasising on how previous batches of sec 5s ""failed"" and went to ITE even in the first month of sec 5!",btohqsg
Just pass u off to another school,btohqsg
Hahahahah ya sia how do u know which course to apply ü§£,btohqsg
schools do this to every cohort I feel,btohqsg
like they dun believe that we'll be able to succeed :x,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like gambling during CNY u know,btohqsg
Oh... u seem like in a special position,btohqsg
PROVE TO THEM WIF UR OS RESULTS,btohqsg
Many teachers told me privately after their announcement that please don't study too hard.,btohqsg
Because I am usually study crazily,btohqsg
Teachers see Sec 5 from the POV of someone who‚Äôs seen hundreds of Sec 5s,btohqsg
Maybe you all can make it,btohqsg
But they‚Äôve seen hundreds more who cannot,btohqsg
My first report was almost straight As. I think I failed in the mid semester. Because I can't even focus in the exam. I was so depressed,btohqsg
Ok.. yes jc is quit depressing.. if we dun properly focus. I also v depressed sia,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a ‚Äòends justify the means‚Äô kind of thing,btohqsg
No  it's to do with something other than academics,btohqsg
What does it matter the tactic you use as long as you can get them to make the right decision (in your mind),btohqsg
The impact is too strong is it. I got fucking anxiety after the whole jc education. Took many years to overcome it lei,btohqsg
This is definitely too general an attitude for a teacher to take  because late bloomers exist,btohqsg
"ok if ur N lvls results is great and ur foundation is good then its ok for sec 5.but some students enter sec 5 without a good foundation so the chers try to ""scare"" them and let them enter dpp instead",btohqsg
Or rather  find a solution to it. Work harder or maybe get more expertised help. If ask u dun emphasize on grades can u fully let go and not let it affect u?,btohqsg
my chers told me this ^,btohqsg
He didn‚Äôt even look at his results,btohqsg
I think he‚Äôs let go already,btohqsg
Yes haha if u dun like to study   then jc will be depressing,btohqsg
I don't really want to discuss the specifics here. But it has nothing to do with academics.A lot of Singaporeans I met in the education system look down on people who studied overseas. It was not my choice...,btohqsg
Hahahahahaah ü§£ teachers r naggy in my experience. They nag too much and make big hoo ha out of everything,btohqsg
if u fail eng/math  go back nitec/higher nitec den uwaste one year,btohqsg
One HOD in some other JC I went to apply told me 'you will never make it',btohqsg
Stake it all to win it all,btohqsg
Oh. Ok.. didnt know local jc can be that bad,btohqsg
Then they can deploy teachers to focus on younger levels n other core CCAs,btohqsg
Hahahaha typical old fashioned teachers. Teachers r naggy in my views,btohqsg
The issue with high risk things is that you must go into it with no hesitation,btohqsg
bcs they kept telling us how difficult sec 5 is  when we chose the route liao,btohqsg
Like our bro here. He did it successfully hahaha,btohqsg
to make yall quit ah ?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs probably not true for many Sec 5s,btohqsg
cuz dpp had 2 phases  second one is in jan so we still had chance to drop out sec 5 and enter dpp,btohqsg
So that's why I say  it's not the end,btohqsg
üôÉ ok but one thing my sec sch principal did correctly. She made us stay back n be audience to our seniors on result announcement day. That atmosphere really scared me alot,btohqsg
In the end  I can do what I wanted to do in university,btohqsg
We saw seniors laugh n cry like mad ppl,btohqsg
When they get back the result,btohqsg
So each time i think of it i study damn hard,btohqsg
I dun usually give a damn to my studies,btohqsg
But that time i really studied hard due to the fear,btohqsg
Oh wow u must be a scholar,btohqsg
Singapore scared me away after all the incidents. So I am now studying overseas. I don't want depression to worsen again,btohqsg
Nope. Can a Singaporean citizen be a scholar? I don't think so...,btohqsg
My JC2 class had so many scholars,btohqsg
Maybe thats just wad the teachers r driving at,btohqsg
Initially yes. Now I don't care so much. My university grades aren't amazing  always pulled down by applied mathematics,btohqsg
U r like having a conversation with the us from 5mins ago,btohqsg
My sec 5 seniors were very cool üòÇ so my impression of ppl gg to sec 5 is they very streetsmart n cool,btohqsg
At least I say  I'm on track to a first class honours  so it's fine,btohqsg
I been noticing ur talking here. I think u r intellectual lol. And smart too,btohqsg
I don't like a lot of things. I dislike School mathematics and competition mathematics,btohqsg
What do you dislike about competition maths?,btohqsg
Lol she is a woman? Ya same. But my jc chem tutor is male  he was super cool!! He was from NJC too!!!,btohqsg
Huh? Which educator says such thing?? Wad the,btohqsg
some of my classmates got D7 for either emath or english :x,btohqsg
Not a lot of transferrable skills to do research. I don't like trying to find special cases. I love proving things in general  not shading boxes...,btohqsg
I went home and cried so bad. Most JCs didn't like me because I don't have O levels.,btohqsg
I cI think is more of what individual wantsR they okay to bite the bullet n take a more mainstream routeOr r they ok to go thru nitec with a less stressful lifeAnyway stress is caused by habits. Challenges exist everywhere after awhile,btohqsg
Is it? I din noe that. Huh u serious????,btohqsg
Oh  ya guessed that. Nus maths uh,btohqsg
ppl look at grades like its gonna define ur life,btohqsg
did anyone ask ur teacher wads ur predicted grades frm moe,btohqsg
My skool and Jurong Sec both did it,btohqsg
yeah but some of them refuse to bite the bullet and they have fun throughout the year den gg,btohqsg
Hmmm.. i am surprised that my jc has too,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre allowed to reveal even after you graduate,btohqsg
In the A level GP exam since they sent the papers to the Uk I wrote a paragraph on UK stuff. Don't know why many people only write Singapore stuff ,btohqsg
No  Jurong was my internship school,btohqsg
Nope. I was accepted quickly but I was frankly fed up with Singapore. I was so depressing. Better go elsewhere.,btohqsg
Hahaha yes ur self expectation is really high. But good job bro. Rmb to take a chill pill sometimes ya,btohqsg
like lets say ur on good terms w the cher,btohqsg
Ouch. It hurts. Actually my jc sch counsellor also told me dun waste time when i wanted to quit sch. I fking dun respect her views thereafter cos she insensitive to my situation and study needs,btohqsg
The issue with prelims in Singapore is that the grades usually aren't good. Applying for overseas universities are tough. For example no one in my JC2 school had A for GP. Max was B.,btohqsg
THEY MADE YOU SIT THRU RESULTS DAY,btohqsg
For o level i ask my teacher on msn but she keep on siam my question so i eventually figured out she not supposed to reveal üòÇüòÇüòÇ cos i been doing badly in physics but my combined science grade turned out well so i asked her. Then later i ask her is it she not allowed to say  then she say yes,btohqsg
would get my ass to stop procrastinating,btohqsg
I never attended results day. The school later called my parents to pick it up.,btohqsg
I know some people can be so insensitive. I also had bad experience with some counsellors,btohqsg
Hows results day for your school?,btohqsg
Do they like announce everyone's results?,btohqsg
U probably got like 40+ anyway,btohqsg
they show the students who got 5 and more distinctions xp,btohqsg
Not up to the standards of an ACSian üò≠,btohqsg
Cos everyone was young wad. We always wanna cherish our youth living carefree. Cos thats our best spot,btohqsg
no compassion  empathy  respect. that person is an asshole,btohqsg
Ya thats the stressful part in my mind. I wonder why we bother cos foreigners marking our paper. Aiya whatever la,btohqsg
Thank you. But I think I shall get her out of my life.,btohqsg
What country u feel is better?,btohqsg
I should write a thank you card to Khan Academy instead of my school's teachers,btohqsg
earlier this year  i had suicidal thoughts. since my friends realised that  they referred me to the sch councillor. turns out i felt even more worse. instead  she just told me to deal with it. luckily  i had supportive friends and teacher who help me overcome it. moral of the story  never go to a councillor as they only emphasise on your prob and find out hidden ones.,btohqsg
I just went to the UK to do an exchange and I loved it!,btohqsg
yea if that's what you wish  then it's a good idea. keeping her in your life more can just make you feel worse,btohqsg
Then u stay home üòÇ dun have maths   dun go anywhere,btohqsg
omg Khan Academy that dude is a legend,btohqsg
Yeah  I wanted to commit suicide in JC1,btohqsg
I think empathy is very important to people in that situation,btohqsg
IDK I felt like I took IB a bit too lightly,btohqsg
ck12 and khan academy have helped me more than all of my teachers,btohqsg
Like schools always focus on who did well and never talk about those who didnt,btohqsg
then you end up thinking that anyone can do well,btohqsg
and oragnic chemistry tutor for me,btohqsg
end up the statistics are very different,btohqsg
"sigh.. i'm glad you feel better now. it's such an asian thing for people to say ""get over it"" in response to someone talking about their emotions which is like a taboo subject lol",btohqsg
I was startled üòÇ i didnt expect that from a counsellor!??? I felt hopeless  cos i tot at least i can get some help from counsellor cos she is counsellor leh hello,btohqsg
This was what I wrote for my A level GP  one paragraph of it,btohqsg
If counsellor cant help i tot nobody could alr,btohqsg
And you know how whenever there are open house  they always ask those top achievers to give propaganda speeches,btohqsg
But a cohort has so many ppl how to announce everyone??,btohqsg
and yes then lead to this,btohqsg
some councillors ( most actually) dont really help you to overcome what you are going thru. change my mind,btohqsg
counseller useless lah. TBH my friend say if you feel like shit  take a deep breath and go to IMH  best counsellors all there (unless you wanna go private),btohqsg
life saver bro especially the night before exams,btohqsg
The good teachers are really good lah  but the bad ones are really shitty,btohqsg
I know  it's really sad. My JC1 counsellor was quite understanding though. But everyone is different. I have also heard about complaints about the SOS hotline with the operators,btohqsg
Ohh ok maybe school counsellors are tanking for the ricebowl. Maybe they themselves r half dead on the inside alr ü§£Oh but i hope u r better now. R u?,btohqsg
most school counsellors are there to just tell you to be happy when you're sad. if you genuinely need help it's better to see a trained therapist outside of school,btohqsg
I was from Jurong sec hehe,btohqsg
Oh.. wow.. whats good about there? Cos in terms of difficulty level  uk standard is higher  is it?,btohqsg
all the pain has went away,btohqsg
UK has more emphasise on pure mathematics than say  Singapore.But I like the environment and the way of life there. It felt so normal and I was so at ease.,btohqsg
my pri sch counsellor was a super sweet lady and we genuinely liked her  but my sec sch counsellor... homophobic  hatred against other religions  etc etc. seriously? how to be counsellor like that,btohqsg
do they allow alum to go back to school for teacher day?,btohqsg
TBH tho  UK's A Levels is nothing compared to singapore,btohqsg
My private tutors have helped me more than school teachers cos my school teachers very busy  no time for me. But my tutors were moe teachers from their own school too  how come they can give tuition??? Like got loophole hereüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÖ,btohqsg
eh working and pursuing part time dip,btohqsg
Homophobia is quite common in Singapore though...,btohqsg
I am talking about university. Not A levels,btohqsg
MOE Teachers can do a certain amount of tuition per month I believe,btohqsg
honestly maybe sch counsellors are like that as they give counselling for free,btohqsg
If they talk about who didnt do well wouldnt it be digging their wound?? And exposing their shame n inferiority too,btohqsg
because can earn more through tuition mah,btohqsg
uk uni easier than sg one?,btohqsg
Uk unis have a stronger mathematics tradition,btohqsg
yea  i'm not sure if 'hate' is the correct word la  but she would preach her own religion openly and also use her god's name to justify her dislike of LGBT,btohqsg
my egeog teacher would only help those who got potential,btohqsg
Somewhere in northern england. I don't wish to share too much here,btohqsg
Huh. Whats then their significant really???? I am so confused,btohqsg
if i give up stats for h2 math can still get A anot,btohqsg
Never been to NUS or NTU  so I don't know. But it's not that easy  trust me.If you go to Oxbridge it would be crazily difficult,btohqsg
I never tried imh counsellors before so idk but i felt the most impactful ‚Äúcounsellors‚Äù in my life were some sales boss / corporate trainer in my work life üòÇ,btohqsg
Then when any parents approach me during my school open house  I always tell the truth about how trashy most teachers actually are,btohqsg
It's why Acta Mathematica's latest issue has no University of Cambridge authors/s,btohqsg
You might pull down their L1r5 and then their school rep drop,btohqsg
their bonus and all kena whack,btohqsg
i tink if i go uni wil die,btohqsg
I can't believe people would preach religion as all schools are supposed to be secular,btohqsg
unfortunately  yea. but that doesn't make it acceptable. furthermore as a counsellor  they should be open to everyone and their office should be a safe space. she would post about anti-LGBT stuff on her facebook and idk what would happen in her office but i knew a few schoomates who had to see her and they're LGBT,btohqsg
lol but honestly some teachers actually agreed with me lmao,btohqsg
Yep. Interviewer informed me I'm in. Later  they rejected me...,btohqsg
Actually my sec sch teachers - i feel most of them are really good. They are extremely dedicated and good in their field. 99% of them are,btohqsg
Sounds like someone somewhere screwed up a process,btohqsg
in school  she has mentioned it once or twice  but she preaches on her public social media,btohqsg
I tried for Cambridge. You cannot do both except in special cases,btohqsg
Lol üòÇ they just need an upgraded phone operator,btohqsg
My sec 4 match teacher used to lock her students in a room to do A math till 7,btohqsg
That's good. In my school  only math dept is decent,btohqsg
Wow  I'm so sorry to hear that,btohqsg
