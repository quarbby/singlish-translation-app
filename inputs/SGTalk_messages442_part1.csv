16 years for a murder is alr light compared to other people leh and somemore he did it out of fun eh,btohqsg
"if he is backed up with IMH report  i dun think it's fair to say ""he did it out of fun""",btohqsg
If u notice in recent years    many trying to escape jail terms by saying depression  anxiety etc,btohqsg
Im not saying the imh report is fake,btohqsg
True but I recalled that him and his clique hid in the toilet before morning assembly saying that whoever came into the toilet first will kena out of a bet or something and that boy was the unlucky as he needed to use restroom before going down for assembly,btohqsg
I have frd who is really not that mentally sick  can 'escape' longer jail terms 😅,btohqsg
end of the day is whether they can make a doc fork out the report lo,btohqsg
the fact that the first sentencing is this  is already on accounts of many considerations,btohqsg
we can never know the real real things,btohqsg
Only when u knw the real person in life  then can uds the situation better,btohqsg
this is how the world is...,btohqsg
at least that was what the papers stated when it was first published out,btohqsg
"And my 'mentally sick"" frd is married happily with his wife",btohqsg
Many times i need to say him times n times again  dont do it again 😅,btohqsg
"if he dun do means he didn't ""relapse"" lor",btohqsg
"He restricted himself from using ""camera' phone",btohqsg
He wanted to be killed by cop but he could’ve done that without actually taking an innocent life,btohqsg

these are logical thinking. if u talk to an unstable person  u never know what they think,btohqsg
every second their idea can change,btohqsg

i can only say...let the law decide ba,btohqsg
Pang kang! Today all the rides are bigger car!,btohqsg
If the one killed is your kid i think you will have different view .,btohqsg
i won't know  becos it's my kid,btohqsg
why not u go ask the parents who decided to reveal their child's name? perhaps they have a reason as well.,btohqsg
everyone has an opinion  and opinion is not fact,btohqsg
and seriously  end of the day the law decides. i can appeal  but law decides.,btohqsg
