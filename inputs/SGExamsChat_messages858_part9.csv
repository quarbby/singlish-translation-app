Even academically inclined students can benefit from tuition,btohqsg
That's why i mean by it can more useful for at most fetting you a pass or a B,btohqsg
Mainly the fact that they can get all their doubts addressed at a faster pace than asking your school teachers who are swarmed with all the other nonsense that isnt teaching,btohqsg
But i dont have very huge beliefs on it giving you an A,btohqsg
a pass and a B is a huge range,btohqsg
so that point isn't really saying anything,btohqsg
My point is that you cannot just rely on tuition alone,btohqsg
I mean thats a given point,btohqsg
i think pass to B is a more accurate range and i agree A isn't achievable from tuition alone,btohqsg
If you did and got A then i shouldve gotten AAA/A,btohqsg
all it's really saying tho is that tuition works to diff degrees for diff people,btohqsg
but if you wanna trace back to specifics  you're gonna be here all day,btohqsg
I mean of course i get where everyone is coming from,btohqsg
I feel Tuition Teachers jobs might be threaten with AI chatbox that regrugitate out data faster than teachers can.,btohqsg
Half yes half no on this one,btohqsg
just give it couple of years. lol.,btohqsg
Ehhhh considering how much im using AI to teach my own ass now,btohqsg
I am still think on whether to buy the full version of chatgpt,btohqsg
me basically ask ChatGPT/DeepSeek on prompt engineering a python script everyday to postprocess my company dump. /heh/,btohqsg
Bur i didnt buy it lol,btohqsg
Funny because my friend joke with me that im worthless because AI can probably do anything and everything that i can do,btohqsg
Not sure what my education is for,btohqsg
well  now you can actually find some meaning in your life. lol,btohqsg
Not much on the technical stuff,btohqsg
Once i find it ill let you know,btohqsg
It gave me a quarter life crisis,btohqsg
not just becoming white collar slaves.,btohqsg
It is making me question the meaning of life,btohqsg
Thing is  i really dont mind being a white collar slave,btohqsg
But the fact is that AI can probably do all of that in the near future,btohqsg
Ok tbh physics is technically meaning of the universe or smth shit like that,btohqsg
The only thing I can say is,btohqsg
hmm i'm not really afraid of being replaced by AI,btohqsg
At this rate I rather let them use AI to do lab report lmao,btohqsg
then what you be doing after you been replaced? lol,btohqsg
Yall dont wanna know what i have seen in sem 1 to make me feel that way,btohqsg
what i do can't be replaced,btohqsg
And do earn money by being a travel blogger,btohqsg
reminds me the horror era of people relying on Chegg for answers.,btohqsg
if they need AI to do lab reports  they don't even deserve to pass,btohqsg
They say employers reject all PES E?,btohqsg
i think you're thinking of PES F,btohqsg
Chegg answers - pen written  answer works sometimes seems unverified and wrongs.,btohqsg
I know of juniors who entirely do their lab reports with AI...,btohqsg
eh my experience is just mastering physics that people use it for,btohqsg
Omg lemmi tell you how stupid this thing is,btohqsg
doing COVID  we have take home exams,btohqsg
i hope they realise i can spot it. i just choose not to flag it,btohqsg
some people just upload the entire Exam onto it and paid someone to solve it lol,btohqsg
The ppl who have been saying pes E cannot be hired mostly come from SAF ppl,btohqsg
