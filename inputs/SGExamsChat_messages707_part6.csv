in sg its just h2 math and phys amirite?,btohqsg
Cause show that you have aptitude,btohqsg
but if u want fm  math must be offered right?,btohqsg
Just curious what subj do you take,btohqsg
and if thats the case you can only do 1 h2 science...,btohqsg
i think thats the big reason why nobody in my class wanted fm,btohqsg
Yep fmath requires one to take h2 math. As habibi5201 said h2 math is assumed knowledge for fmath,btohqsg
fmath is counted as sci subj,btohqsg
but yea i get what you mean,btohqsg
pcmh 4h2. i only took phys because it opens more doors in science courses in uni  albeit i have more love for bio than phys. i took triple pure science in upper sec  got A1 for all 3  so could choose between bio and phys. ultimately my choice went to phys because standalone bio is useless for uni while phys is still more useful for say  eng courses,btohqsg
i love history  while h2 chem is just required for all science courses. math  explanatory. the fundamental subject after all. you always need to take math everywhere,btohqsg
Your friend can read some the comments here,btohqsg
If he wants an idea why uk a levels is better should he want to go Oxbridge,btohqsg
This SKAOG guy claims he took both Singapore a levels and uk a levels so seems quite reliable,btohqsg
I’ve seen some other comments he made and I think he knows his stuff,btohqsg
This is quite a notable pointYea british students have so much leeway compared to SG students. If aUK student drops by 2 from perfect grades (A*A*A* to A*AA)  they still are likekly to keep their spot  while an SG student is fked if the screw up even one subject (H2 AAA to H2 AAB). Additionally  I Cambridge specifically wants 4 H2s  from SG students while only requiring 3 UK A Levels from British Students. Though it is what it is as they prioritise local students over international students,btohqsg
Not forgetting to mention Cambridge expects 4 subjects with perfect grades instead of 3Edit nvm I realised he said that there,btohqsg
yeah even though our exams are literally more difficult than theirs..,btohqsg
But it is what it is,btohqsg
Have to favour the Uk students else they gonna complain lol,btohqsg
ya like in sg imagine if sg unis favoured intl students over sgreans,btohqsg
"but they do like this so that you can ""breeze through the first 2 years of uni""",btohqsg
Like my brother is in some linguistics related course and he’s better than almost all the local students,btohqsg
I said he went to Cambridge lol,btohqsg
i dont remember things well for stuff that arent rly impt,btohqsg
dang no wonder all the smart genes goes to the older child,btohqsg
I think I’ve seen other comments about like how Singapore students are like better than their Uk counterparts in general,btohqsg
I feel like my younger sib is smarter than me 🥲🥲,btohqsg
I beat my brother in math at least,btohqsg
He got B but it’s because he barely studied,btohqsg
He was banking on his h3 lit to enter Cambridge,btohqsg
now i unds why he does linguistics,btohqsg
okay yeah i should get going because im at home and finished my lunch alr,btohqsg
nono im the oldest  my sib is the youngest,btohqsg
oh so ur brother that went to cambridge is younger than you,btohqsg
i took BCMH 4h2whyh2bio: i always liked bio since i was young  and gain more interest in it as i go up. i wanted to do bio related stuff sincd y2. and i want to pursue bio in the future! also i only took bio in upper sec so i can't take physics. not interested in physics anywaywhyh2chem:have to take h2 bio with h2 chem in my school unless you appeal so no choice lol (i know 1 person who takes h1 chem with h2 bio) also the uni course i want needs h2 chemwhyh2math:i don't want h1 math  and i think math is cool. also opens wayy more doors compared to h1 mathwhyh2history: interested in SEA history + backup subject for UAS computation incase h2 chem goes wrong,btohqsg
Given all these  it would be even easier for one in IB to enter Oxbridge than one who took Singapore a levels,btohqsg
IB is good for overseas unis,btohqsg
would be great if i could extend it tho,btohqsg
"Based on personal experience and anecdotes  alot of teachers in these so called ""top"" schools don't even teachThey just give you readings  slides and videos to go through. then you do worksheets (which they dont care if you do yourself or group work) then self mark. If have qn ask teacher. During alot of the lesson teacher uses phone while ppl can discuss while doing the assigned work",btohqsg
Why not try getting a 2nd phd after your first,btohqsg
Oh ok then what you intend to do after this,btohqsg
poly people trying to submit assignments on time challenge: impossible,btohqsg
standard research route is postdocs -> faculty somewhere but that's very rare so idm doing research for industry or government institutes those kind,btohqsg
Time for a QS world ranking of the Singapore JCs 😁,btohqsg
It’s not a world ranking if it’s intranational,btohqsg
Yup. Sg unis I would say favour Singapore students but not as extreme as UK,btohqsg
If they complaining they can’t enter it’s probably a skill issue,btohqsg
the standards for locals entering is extremely low compared to international students,btohqsg
when i saw his first comment i was 💀💀 cause ik ppl who went to nus with BBB/C at A lvl,btohqsg
