Pes A/B + pass IPPT => 1 yrs 10 mnthsRemainder (i.e. Pes C/E or nvr pass IPPT) => 2 yrs,btohqsg
Would it be better to get Pes A B or Pes C D in terms of slacking off (so i can spend more free time) and any other benefits from your experience?,btohqsg
From my understanding Pes A and B are the more physically fit people thats all i know about the grades,btohqsg
Tbh I dont rlly know much abt the pes A and B vocations,btohqsg
But as a previous PES E clerk due to scoliosis  it was quite chill/slack for me uh,btohqsg
Like literally  it gotten so boring to thr extent I actually had to do Physics qns to prepare for my uni course,btohqsg
I dont think it matters which pes,btohqsg
Is more abt the vocations uh,btohqsg
The problem  you cant pick vocations,btohqsg
"So for now  is more of a ""just wait and see"" kind of situation",btohqsg
But definitely I think they will give some form of admin time for you to do whatever you want while you are in the bunk.,btohqsg

can still register o lvls chinese or whatever exam u wanna retake while being in poly,btohqsg
ur chinese mid year exam or end of year: try not crash with class tests / term / sem exams…. ur excused w valid reasons fr normal lessons and exams.,btohqsg
I see but the main problem is i need my one subject to have a better mark to go to the poly i want  so thats why i wanna retake exams. So if i go poly next year  i can only take a course i hav no interest in.,btohqsg
scoliosis 😶 seems like scoliosis is getting more frequent for youths? 🤯,btohqsg
⛈️ Were you caught in the rain today? A torrential downpour caused flooding in several parts of the island  with water levels rising to almost knee-deep in some areas.,btohqsg
⛈ The rainfall recorded over western Singapore on Oct 14 was among the highest in over 40 years.https://str.sg/6BPq,btohqsg
wait u hv a total of 5/4 subj ?,btohqsg
including last year and this year,btohqsg
retake you can pick how many subject to redo,btohqsg
sorry my bad i read it as one less subj,btohqsg
junior... the scoring is not according to subject amount  but grading scores :),btohqsg
if 1-2 marks away from cut off pnt  cn try dae,btohqsg
having 6 or 7 subjects is no difference,btohqsg
as long as below 26 pnts can still enter,btohqsg
1. dae does not work for private candidate,btohqsg
2. below 26 ofc can enter even 28 can enter nursing poly,btohqsg
i’m in poly. i hear frm my peers they dae even tho they r private candidate. dae is not hitting the cut off pnts for a course. e.g media cut off point is 16 but u score 18. u can try dae and they still accept it,btohqsg
u ask fr opinion u don’t be rude,btohqsg
you cant dae without a school,btohqsg
private candidate is different from sch candidate,btohqsg
i was sch candidate. dae also works for poly transfer students. if u r not sure  then call the poly admission,btohqsg
If your not sure  do not spread fake news,btohqsg
"also coming from somebody who believed that ""amount of subjects>5 enough to go poly"" i dont think you have provided any valuable feedback",btohqsg
u gotta be grateful ppl are trying to help you whether u think is nonsense or not. don’t be rude LOL. i misread one subj to retake as one less subj. if u think it’s invaluable feedback  u can voice it out w/o sounding it rude and mocking. i’m a student in poly  not a poly advisor / ecg counsellor so take it w a pinch of salt. i tell u what i know or heard of. i’m not free to check whether this is true or not. although i’m studying  i still help you out. a quick google search shows that private candidate also still can do dae except those who accepted an offer and withdrawn the offer at eae so maybe improve on your googling .https://www.sp.edu.sg/sp/admissions/admissions-exercises/admission-criteria/by-qualification#:~:text=Singapore%20Citizens%20and%20Permanent%20Residents to%20apply%20under%20this%20exercise.&text=%5BDAE%20not%20applicable%20to%20those O'%20Levels%20as%20private%20candidates.,btohqsg
In the article it clearly states private candidates are only eligible for JAE O N L Y,btohqsg
read the screenshot i sent u,btohqsg
you keep thinking you are right but in the end the odds are against you,btohqsg
u call the poly admission officer up. if u ask and call them  they will js clear yr doubts,btohqsg
then u ask ur sec sch teacher lor,btohqsg
you focused on the wrong column,btohqsg
I already knew from my sec teacher,btohqsg
and i didnt ask for whether or not dae is applicable,btohqsg
you are the boy who asked ME whether it is applicable or not,btohqsg
show me the right column for private candidates then,btohqsg
cause that is the only column,btohqsg
js shows ur entilted. even other ppl screenshot for u  u still laugh at ppl.,btohqsg
i know cause dae is applicable to even international students,btohqsg
i don't get why you're being so paggro with seeking alternative answers,btohqsg
