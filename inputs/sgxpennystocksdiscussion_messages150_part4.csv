All trying to rush out vaccine first  scare something goes wrong like what what the movies has been predicting. üòó,btohqsg
It was indicated in the analyst report . Those who have read will know.,btohqsg
The analyst report on 3rd already say no dividends.,btohqsg
Actually don‚Äôt need analyst to tell u earn and earn till this figure zeroed to retained earnings can pay dividends.,btohqsg
Hence some counters they do a capital reduction to zero the AL,btohqsg
Only co with retained earnings can issue dividends,btohqsg
But then this part I think many will not know,btohqsg
Wow.. That‚Äôs mean to buy now and pick up some durian for 1h2021!,btohqsg
So good that the analyst report got point out,btohqsg
So 3Q need make 270m to zero out. Then make 350m make it positive 80m RE and payout 50%Still how much only,btohqsg
Aiyo the world like kena conned by it sia,btohqsg
Maybe next fullYear result will have whining on sj say no div share price drop,btohqsg
Sats no dividends share price up,btohqsg

What can I buy on Monday to become super rich by Friday?,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt find the counter on sgx,btohqsg
Toto but odds are very low üòõ,btohqsg
Sometimes the report who wrote the news is also ignorant,btohqsg
Jiutian declared no dividend in an effort to conserve resources for its ongoing operations in case of adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment.,btohqsg
I dun win Toto and take the bottle of sleeping pill,btohqsg
There can never be a standard reason for why sp up or down  especially in the short term.Why go and find an excuse to console oneself for the loss incurred.,btohqsg
Did they say no dividends Bec conserve resources? No le. The co can‚Äôt pay dividend Bec of accumulated losses in the balance sheet . Under companies act they cannot pay dividends,btohqsg
The ceo cash out n run road.. laughing all the way to the bank,btohqsg
If you buy ordinary will be 1 is to 13 million  and if buy System 12 will be reduced to 1 is to 13 000+-,btohqsg
Before buying the shares  one should have known the company has rmb300+ in accumulated losses from last Dec. And the company will not be about to pay a dividend over the next 2 years even with bumper profits. So  those who DYODD before buying will never put this into dividend play.,btohqsg
How many will hold 3-4 years for jiutianWillHave a big dip and prolonged so long most will throw and spit on it,btohqsg
They withdraw and say no funding,btohqsg
No need think so far . Hit target price good enough,btohqsg

Hi-p make a major losses for a particular year,btohqsg
Ya because of the annoucement t... All medical down... Aiyo.. Now come out pattern,btohqsg
When oil price was high. Sembcorp marine share price highest is $5.40,btohqsg
Oil drop the share price also drop,btohqsg
So Jt fortune hinges on DMF price,btohqsg
The oil price also never up,btohqsg
The co say sustainable demand ..,btohqsg
So will be demand more than supply,btohqsg
The co director never sell of his 50 million plus shares and bought more. I see it as positive .,btohqsg
Bro@furion07really meant it well for u. I‚Äôm serious. U know what happen To SYNAGIe & aspen,btohqsg

Anyway have a great weekend . We will know if JT can prove itself . Anyway dmf prices are available on website . We won‚Äôt know the future . I remember I sold aem at a lost of $15000 when they issue a profit warning . Sold at $0.89. If I knw aem can be so ‰∫âÊ∞î„ÄÇI would not have sold it ... IF. Lol,btohqsg
I sold sats  and I didn‚Äôt expect it went up until I saw this,btohqsg
Of course . I am no investment genius. I just Ê≠•Ê≠•‰∏∫Ëê•. Just make sure profits more than losses .,btohqsg
Made a loss still can go up,btohqsg
Sg is just a small island country so cold chain handling is not an issue,btohqsg
Internal transport for poor countries will have more problems,btohqsg
Abit like telsa in the past. Goldman Sachs think they will go down Bcz of loss but Juz went up,btohqsg
Actually hor  I feel aspen is diversifying their business. Their main is property  sideline is gloves.I also worried that the placement will not go through cause the ssh sold shares after news release. Abit scheming.But hor  maybe he will subscribe placement or buy at lower to support.Then the factory already started building. So they are really serious about it.What u all think?,btohqsg
They Juz Get some pieces of cake in glove side n also alleviate the loss in the property side,btohqsg
