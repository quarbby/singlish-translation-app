text,group
but if y'all think that these kinds of conversations are appropriate for a chat group meant for students between the age of 15-19  then ya go ahead,btohqsg
if relationships convo then yes its more than appropriate for 15 and above,btohqsg
Because that’s how it be sometimes,btohqsg
But you enlisting next week right,btohqsg
I just don't want the chat to go into extreme levels of detail,btohqsg
because apparently that's all that youths nowadays are caught up with,btohqsg
i mean to be fair 15-19 yr olds have RS and then when break up its like the end of the world,btohqsg
"part of ite tagline: ""hearts on  hands on  minds on""",btohqsg
As you age relationships aren’t the world to you anymore,btohqsg
Sad that you lose the romantic sentimentality,btohqsg
Good that you become less obsessive,btohqsg
That’s how it be when all u want is someone to love u,btohqsg

Jaded is just another word for realist,btohqsg

then we obsess over what we lose,btohqsg
1) dw rls and enjoying life2) can't find love,btohqsg
She’s a woman she doesn’t need a man to be a confident and brilliant individual,btohqsg
awkward sia first time meeting her with the family,btohqsg
bet she has that tomboy hair cut,btohqsg
a couple of youths having an existential crisis over a romantic bond between two individuals,btohqsg
Just putting it out there cuz Idk why “she’s not married” was supposed to be valid information,btohqsg
