RUSSIAN President Vladimir Putin arrived for his first visit to North Korea in 24 years as the US warned the meeting could further arms transfers from Kim Jong Un's regime that aid the Kremlin in its assault on Ukraine.,btohqsg
🚀Pika World Breakfast Update - 19 June 2024🚀The bull isn't resting. The S&P 500 continued its ascent  up by 0.3% despite a relatively quiet trading session. This is the sixth record closing in seven trading days. The Nasdaq inched higher by 0.1% to hit its seventh consecutive trading-day high. This marked Nasdaq's longest winning streak since 2021.💸Retail Sales Disappoint🚦Data showed a 0.1% growth in May from April  which is below the 0.2% consensus. This is still an uptick from the 0.2% decline seen in April. The cooler number is welcoming to investors who are hoping for easing consumer spending  enough to tame inflation but keep the economy moving. This sent bond yields down and lifted equity.📖Multiple Fed's speech📤During the trading session  numerous Fed officials discussed their thoughts on the economy and monetary policy. Such speeches tend to shift the market  but nothing new comes to excite it drastically. Most central bankers remain on the same page  reflecting a wait-and-see mentality as they remain data-dependent.🎲Inflation Outlook and Progress🔒There are indeed signs of progress made on the inflation front  echoed by Louis Fed President Alberto  but similarly  more data is needed to confirm the trend The market is closed for the Juneteenth holiday. US markets will resume trading on Thursday.Have a splendid break.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg

Occupancy looks bad on us side,btohqsg
The data centres portfolio in North America has been falling and is now at 86.2%. Investors need to keep a close eye on this as the US economy is slowing down.Business Park occupancy is at 80.9%. This is another red flag which may affect its DPU as more workers prefer to work from home.The Light Industrial Buildings has the worst occupancy at 52.1%. This is really bad and MIT should do something about it.,btohqsg
