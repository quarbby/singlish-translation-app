Coal is not welcomed for future green energy if golden earned so much and no dividend then why we park money there…,btohqsg

haha.. me🙆🏻‍♂️ focus on our 🇸🇬Reits for decent dividend😊,btohqsg
Thks for sharing.. gd nite 💤😴,btohqsg
The car for you leh .. auntie never mind,btohqsg
If u want good dividend  why GEAR in the first place. Go for GEO. Gear keep expanding the coal resources by acquisitions  and still have substantial borrowings. GEO on the other hand  is net cash position.,btohqsg
What’s this hahaha 😝 need to get to work,btohqsg
Singapore Medical Group (SMG) is one the most established group of medical/specialist set up.This one starting to come awake after being in limbo and in a tight range $0.295 to $0.320.Good thing to note and why this could be an excellent longer term investment- Aging population in Singapore 🇸🇬 and in the region- Singapore have always been know for medical tourism and SMG have positioned themselves as one who welcomes the international clients- BVPS at $0.328- Gearing at a mere 4.58%- Price action coming towards the results very decisive and strong 💪🏼 You can sense that strong hands have been collecting this one- Borders and laxing of travel restrictions as nations start opening up their economies will lead to rise in international medical tourism for Singapore which will in turn aid SMG top and bottom line.- results coming out soon and the PA toward this looks really super- last time when they almost made a deal to sell to another party  price rallied from $0.265 to $0.425 in a few months. With Singapore being resilient to Covid as shown  we can do expect there would certainly be big investors interested in this group. Hence  a possible buy over in the cards.Price Target 🎯- short term to test $0.335- mid to longer term $0.385-$0.405DYODD. OTOT if in the money. Market can change anytime and we have to react always.Good luck holder.PS: who wouldn’t want to own a piece of a company that have over 30 clinics/specialist clinics since we know this is a sure win business and definitely profitable long run?,btohqsg
As shown  SMG are well positioned to benefit in this medical tourism segment. Expecting them to do really well in 2022.DYODD.,btohqsg
Updates on SMG (weekly)Since we started covering and calling buy $0.305 for SingMedical last 2 weeks back. It have steadily risen.It is evident that some one have been accumulating this one based on the PA.Also  SMG fell fast enough after the interested persons initial deal didn’t go through. Once they breech 335 clear  might have a nice candle there since there is not much resistance in 330 to 375.This one ☝️ is one to put in the watchlist.IMO  this one’s a sure winner for longer term HODLersDYODD still,btohqsg
Might not be surprised rex also no dividend then jialat,btohqsg
Oil high capex. No dividend is normal.Gear is abnormal. Lol.,btohqsg
Should have. But may not be much,btohqsg

"Covid-19 breach: 97 people investigated for visiting unlicensed KTV-concept outlet along Syed Alwi RoadThe ""KTV-concept"" outlet was concealed behind a partitioned door of an F&B establishment.The area was furnished into 22 separate karaoke rooms — equipped with karaoke systems  speakers  microphones and televisions — and spread across three shophouse units.➡️https://tdy.sg/3gZuhgg@todayonlinesg",btohqsg
Infact all using prefab  we still need manpower to construct them. And external work  M&E all need manpower.,btohqsg

You said it was her call.In fact the Assistant monitor is the one who recorded it.Assistant monitor: But I explained the meaning of the notes to you.Teacher: No! That's NOT the truth.The truth is that the monitor gave her permission to lie.Rash confirmed (with her 2 best friends) that the monitor said  ""Take it to your grave""I have recommended that the Discipline master deals with the Monitor.He might be expelled from School.Why?He dared to lie to the Teacher!",btohqsg
