Not if he climbs mountain w cat,btohqsg
Nah he cannot be fast as cat,btohqsg
Train for SOC (standard obstacle course),btohqsg
Bedok aint gonna climb over the wall  he gonna lift the wall and crawl under,btohqsg
Ppl go into jc with no knowledge of it at all and get destroyed in ct1,btohqsg
But at the end of the day by a levels it's just another subject lor,btohqsg
So it's more impt to after the post o/ip Yr 4 period to explore what you wanna do,btohqsg
I proudly got 9/25 in my first test lol,btohqsg
^then when u go jc ull be in better shape to study and face the bs in jc,btohqsg
Good also. What u plan to work after uni  the planning actually starts from sec 3 imo,btohqsg
HAHAH no leh I think planning so for ahead only rly applies for overseas,btohqsg
E.g. no add math means go JC will die at h2 math,btohqsg
No h2 math u are out for some courses,btohqsg
if so then take sats lo,btohqsg
Eg I 90 pointer but cuz I didn't go the specialised programs from jc I'm disadvantaged for us unis,btohqsg
if so js take sats for fun if u want,btohqsg
But if you not looking for that kind then tTBH don't need stress so much abt outcome j take things one day at a time lor,btohqsg
some say go ox must have 4 h2s and 1 h3 or wtv but shrugs,btohqsg
my friend takes further math and h3 and hes aiming for mitt,btohqsg
I know 4h2 and 2 h3,btohqsg
4h2 and 1 h3 is not that uncommon,btohqsg
Go read on uni course prerequisite,btohqsg
cuz i only take h1 math,btohqsg
ik amath is kinda useless for h1 math,btohqsg
I shared yearly with parents on uni info,btohqsg
H1 u can go social sci,btohqsg
okay not useless bah but sometimes the skills arent transferable,btohqsg
Even business analytics u need h2,btohqsg
Many are unaware and then regret when go jc,btohqsg
I feel jc shld just take 4h2,btohqsg
That they are not offered the subjecy combi at jc,btohqsg
Can always drop in the future,btohqsg
But a lot harder to take up 4h2 from 3h2 imo,btohqsg
U are from the top jc?,btohqsg
But not for middle tier and below,btohqsg
Whats the h2 policy for the other jcs ah,btohqsg
E.g. raw L1R5 single digit  or for foreign students on scholarships,btohqsg
I come across student no add math no pure sci go jc,btohqsg
Cannot cope and withdraw after 1 year,btohqsg
They couldn't change subject combi ah,btohqsg
Difficult. No pure sci unless go arts but they may not have experience in those sub also die,btohqsg
So sec 3 is crucial tbh but many say wait after Os then decide...abit too late,btohqsg
Subject combi choose early but portfolio no need rush so much?,btohqsg
To me grades first then portfolio,btohqsg
Not say portfolio not impt but no pt being president of something and buang all exams,btohqsg
Back when I in jc everyone stressing over portfolio for med,btohqsg
TO the point where it harm their results,btohqsg
I think the overemphasis on portfolio in all jcs leh HAHAH,btohqsg
Not for the middle or lower tier ones,btohqsg
To let my friend teach her H2 math,btohqsg
