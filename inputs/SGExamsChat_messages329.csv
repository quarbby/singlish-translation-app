Go in with a you're gonna die anw mindset always worked for me LOL,btohqsg
If it's for O's  I'll always remember that I'll only talk to this person once and she don't even know me personally so Idc if she judge me. So just be professional üòâ,btohqsg
check out the mentee links! üôÇ,btohqsg
Examiner: Please have a seatMe: Don‚Äôt mind if I do*lifts chair and walks a metre away before coming back*I managed to get an A for english so I guess this somehow worked. I remember being nervous enough to think this was a great idea during the prep time. Had to get rid of that nervous energy somehow  and the examiner laughed after realising the crummy joke.Bottomline is‚Ä¶ forget the big picture and focus on just being in the room. Take the exam with a focus of just answering the questions well and remind your mind to stay in the room.Just do your best with what you have  know that you did your best at the time  then tackle the next problem when it comes :),btohqsg
U can ask in nyp gc,btohqsg
same my sch cancelled mye too,btohqsg
Urr for me I just be ballsy and pretend ik what I'm doing,btohqsg

Emath Bellcurve can go up to 95% LOL,btohqsg
Will polys have long weekend like if let's say a public holiday is on a weekend then Monday still of or not,btohqsg
I trying to see if it's worth to continue work or if it's too tiring,btohqsg
generally is because many students lose marks to presentation unknowingly.Teachers asking students to aim 90% is not wrong because many students do not form proper mathematical logical statements I think.,btohqsg
Hi  If I received a conditional offer  and I need to submit my last sem results.will my results affect me on confirming my offer in nus?,btohqsg
If holiday falls on a Sunday  Monday will be ph in lieu,btohqsg
Does anyone have any model Karangan descriptif?,btohqsg

Ade but I only have 2 je,btohqsg
To add on  for anyone who is really hungry to score well. It's really a matter of action and discipline.In my first semester in NUS after ORD  I took on 6 modules. No CCA but I managed to squeeze in 2 days to swim in NUS pool  2 days in NUS gym  during lunch hours. 2 days of 4km jog too.And for each of the 3 experiments in the single Physics module  I stayed overnight in school in my army friend's hostel room just to work on the answer for the experiment.9am to 8pm lesson day  then overnight work till 5am  take nap  then submit the pract before 8am  to be able to attend next lecture at 8am.And I was still not the most insane one.That semester I scored cap of 5.0.,btohqsg
When you throw in the ccas,btohqsg
Meanwhile i cant even find motivation to do 1 hr of maths after work,btohqsg

So if we apply 2 Courses for EAE in one Poly example School of Applied Science.Does that mean need go for 2 interview?,btohqsg
SCHOOL OF HEALTH & SOCIAL SCIENCES  So need 2 interview for each EAE?,btohqsg
Maximum how many Poly or courses could I apply?,btohqsg
Oh I thought can apply all the polys,btohqsg
3 courses out of all the 5 poly courses :),btohqsg
I think the person just talking abt their choices,btohqsg
NURSING (C97)Range of Net ELR2B2: 5 to 28,btohqsg
NYP is the best school for Nursing.,btohqsg
is it allowed to apply EAE for 3 courses in the same poly - Chinese media and communication  Chinese studies and mass comm?,btohqsg
this one diff diff no meh,btohqsg
Food Technology which is the best?,btohqsg
Like that DSA we also could apply 3 JC's?,btohqsg
NYP is Pioneer Sch NP also hv Nursing,btohqsg
But go JC confirm go NUS/NYU?,btohqsg
2 yr A Level super demanding,btohqsg
Not like only can go also,btohqsg
Sadly I will say at least 20 percent of the students won't make it there.,btohqsg
Erm it is usually last few days in May and June is holidays and first 1 or 2 weeks in end June / July. So technically is 2 to 3 weeks.,btohqsg
Can only say going to JC will net you a higher chance of entering local U but not necessary 100%.,btohqsg
if u expand to private u becomes close to 100%,btohqsg
If like general all go JC should land a place in NUS or NTU,btohqsg
But seem most Deg courses all need AAA/A,btohqsg
If not a guide like get 10 pts and below go JC,btohqsg
Above 10 pts go Poly better,btohqsg
No pt Private Uni paying so much money;in the end the pay also terrible,btohqsg
straight b gives u access to most,btohqsg
u can get cs and ds for some nus ntu courses also,btohqsg
Its only Computing/Law/Medicine that needs AAA/A,btohqsg
I not gna weigh in on this one,btohqsg
Food Science Technology in NUS also AAA/A,btohqsg
bottom line is regardless wat u do u gotta be good at it,btohqsg
No no English no good F9,btohqsg
Got humans student go to Morgan Stanley I saw before,btohqsg
Difficult to earn a living for humanities as compare those Science;Technology,btohqsg
avg cs student don't go faang sia,btohqsg
That my personal perception.No offence to those in Humanities field,btohqsg
i think whatever course u do got to be good lor,btohqsg
n Cross ref to your seniors,btohqsg
Maybe go Poly then this what SIT also Degree,btohqsg
Buy SIT maybe low class compare with NUS/NTU,btohqsg
As NUS and NTU World Ranking 10 or 11,btohqsg
Science can survive but not big money,btohqsg
Humanities can go quite general field also,btohqsg
And ya world ranking doesn't mean anything. They judge based on how many papers the uni can churn out.,btohqsg
In the end go NTU  the work I do here mostly not taught in uni. Go in get degree then start learning the real stuff when enter the workforce.,btohqsg
like pay is good but not easy to get paid alot,btohqsg
u below avg student cannot really think of faang quant etc,btohqsg
Starting pay already relatively up there compared to other fields,btohqsg
Your business huat  nothing can defeat your pay,btohqsg
even goldman sacks md pay is soft cap,btohqsg
humanities always have a way out,btohqsg

Is tanking multiple projects a semester a good idea,btohqsg
I got trash groups for three of my mods,btohqsg
I remember tanking a project for one whole sem,btohqsg
They fucked up slides dk how to write script,btohqsg
Dk date of presentation and never attend call,btohqsg
I suggest to go soft and then hard on them,btohqsg
If you have a project given on mon and due on sun,btohqsg
You go soft on them first,btohqsg
Say like aiya when do you think you wanna complete this? Thursday? Friday? What you are doing here is allowing them to choose a appropriate date before finalising and submitting it,btohqsg
Let's just say friday 12 pm,btohqsg
If they still didn't do their work,btohqsg
Saying like by friday 9 pm i expect quality work to be done,btohqsg
And if they still don't give a fuck,btohqsg
Tank the rest yourself or split it equally among the rest,btohqsg
one of my groupmates ponnteng all of the calls,btohqsg
The other transferred to my class because all of his groupmates form his old class marked him down,btohqsg
But you really think attempting to motivate poor groupmates is a good idea,btohqsg
What if they do subpar work,btohqsg
If you tried your best motivating them and they are still an obstinate piece of shit,btohqsg
How tiring is tanking a project and getting A btw,btohqsg
For me i tank imp in sem 1,btohqsg
I need to tank 3 projects this semester,btohqsg
Hmm learn to have some trust,btohqsg
Even if they do their work it's probably gonna be trash,btohqsg
Instead of pushing everything to yourself,btohqsg
Try to entrust some of the work to them,btohqsg
I'm in the same class for 2 years,btohqsg
Then take note of their behaviour,btohqsg
Just need to avoid him dragging me to hell with him,btohqsg
Is it the one we spoke about??,btohqsg
Been in my class since the beginning,btohqsg
Doesn't study the lectures and does garbage work,btohqsg
And he always stuck with you ah,btohqsg
He choose you or the teacher choose one,btohqsg
Got empty slot so he was assigned to me,btohqsg
He's not even the only one too,btohqsg
Did you have sleepless nights from tanking IMP,btohqsg
The idea i came out with is a website,btohqsg
Ye I think I'm gonna have no life this semester,btohqsg
Ye marvelapp was bloody difficult to use,btohqsg
But at least your sem 2 pulled it up,btohqsg
If I didn't screw up my last part in a module,btohqsg
I could've have gotten my once in a life time result,btohqsg
Any advice on how to do it properly,btohqsg
Do you happen to know edrick?,btohqsg
I know a lot of students from bis,btohqsg
Like don't be distracted so easily,btohqsg
Ye my mental health quite fragile at the moment,btohqsg
No point sulking cuz it won't change the fact you have suck ass team,btohqsg
From the prospect of tanking so many modules,btohqsg
This week for me is whitespace week,btohqsg
Given 1 week to do a project,btohqsg
I hope you have better teammates next time,btohqsg
I always go lounge and study,btohqsg
I'm thinking of transferring classes after this semester r,btohqsg
Can't handle my class constantly reshuffling groups already,btohqsg
I thought you can just transfer,btohqsg
Your class got people who actually study one?,btohqsg
Go out with them more often,btohqsg
Literally all their outings is juts,btohqsg
But ye so to tank just focus and be motivated,btohqsg
Mine in june but got learning journey,btohqsg
I just study in advanced lor,btohqsg
Oh ye btw fc new stall quite garbo,btohqsg
You (the stall owner) are a scammer.,btohqsg
Like other food in their menu,btohqsg
Once the malay people finish fasting,btohqsg
Np food club gonna be more crowded,btohqsg
WHERE ARE THE NUTELLA BANANA WAFFLES,btohqsg
They better open up the new stall beside the gym or the poolside,btohqsg
I swear they put it on the menu but nvr stock up on bananas,btohqsg
I aint buying a plain waffle n dg it myself,btohqsg
Im in business not food science,btohqsg

damn it man the j2 life,btohqsg
legit social life here is the worst,btohqsg
i can relate thats why i got out HAHAHA,btohqsg
Why is social life in aus bad?,btohqsg
Hii sorry for the promotion here !! I'm a student looking for a hitch ride daily from my house ( near stadium )to a school in tanah merah,btohqsg
Pls pm if you can help thanks !!,btohqsg
Hello guys  Im looking for some people to do some user testing for a UI prototype.Just need to go through the prototype and answer a few questions. If interested DM me pls!,btohqsg
So go JC does not mean auto land in NUS/NTU?,btohqsg
If A Level get DDD/D means game over?,btohqsg
the game is over if u give up,btohqsg
not game over - means you have to find another way around,btohqsg
you cannot proceed ahead with your a level grades,btohqsg
but if ppl go jc just cuz they think it can get them into uni when they not suited to it,btohqsg
It means most of the courses in the autonomous uni are out of reach. Then you will need to consider private uni in which mostly depends on $$,btohqsg
If go Poly need GPA 4.0?,btohqsg
depends on course  i.e. nus cs usually >3.8,btohqsg
I think this applies for med and rep,btohqsg
the others can be a bit lower,btohqsg
n small intake courses like dent and dsai?,btohqsg
but it is easier to get into uni via JC,btohqsg
rather than a whole bunch of modules (that usually consist of group projects),btohqsg
Wow then need think go JC vs Poly,btohqsg
But if jc go uni is definitely wasy easier,btohqsg
Plus your route after grad from uni is faster,btohqsg
i mean all i know is if u go jc just be someone who isnt in need to know exactly why things work when its not tested  cuz i did pretty badly for my jc time then i went SIM but now im doing pretty good,btohqsg
I always support JC route especially for guys  due to NS.Put it this way  for related engineering courses  poly student get to skip 1 year because 1st year NUS modules are approximately similar to poly 3rd year I guess.But there's 2 years break. Rigour is lost. Jump straight into 2nd year uni not that good an idea.,btohqsg
poly students also don't get easier courses to help with GPA if they jump straight. Or if they also start from scratch  then they lose one year of time.,btohqsg
however if you are not disciplined enough to work hard and not give up  don't go Jc also. JC requires tremendous discipline to do well. That means sacrificing all your games and to some extent  sleep.,btohqsg
Yeahhh i agree if i were in poly i would have 0 chance of going to local U as i dont think i can do projects :( on the other hand im doing rather well in jc :),btohqsg
Not really for certain combis (our u have innate talent) even minimal effort is possible for one to thrive,btohqsg
sad to say  the vast majority do not have the talent. So I cannot give advice based on the talented few.,btohqsg
For those who do well  there's a lot of hard work  sweat and tears behind the success stories,btohqsg
I see a lot of ppl can slack in jc and then cram before a's,btohqsg
In that regard poly is more difficult,btohqsg
The way I see it poly is if you ready to grind for 2.5 yesrs,btohqsg
depends on what level of game u want to play in,btohqsg
Jc if u good at exam and ready to megagrind for a half,btohqsg
some high scorers do that also,btohqsg
I'm the type that hit 90 and above for 3 of the A level subjects,btohqsg
but I was not ready to work hard on the 4th one until 3 months before As,btohqsg
wadio i was a 70 person,btohqsg
let's just say for maths  70% was my lowest actual score and my teacher was actually worried for me when I dropped that low for one of the exams,btohqsg
Ye I think thats the difference,btohqsg
Not possible for poly cuz of the gpa system,btohqsg
not impossiblepoly is pretty similar to uni in that area,btohqsg
I did help an ex student score perfect GPA for one of the poly semesters.Though only one,btohqsg
i calculated one of my postgrad courses,btohqsg
if i got 3.4 for any sem in uni i am toast,btohqsg
that can happen in poly also mah,btohqsg
in jc ct score a bit toilet paper,btohqsg
if u put it that way,btohqsg
Just putting it out here shamelessly haha,btohqsg
true but the course that u do is prob something that u wish to go to and u enjoy doing that ah (provided u get in ofc),btohqsg
poly itself isn't any easier per say,btohqsg
because you basically cram entire modules within 6 months or so w/9 consistent-ish effort you also won't get anywhere,btohqsg
tbh regardless if you go jc / poly there isn't exactly a huge difference in the amount of effort you put in consistently,btohqsg
just that for poly your subjects change every 6 mths and you have a slightly more slack timetable,btohqsg
i think an avg performing jc student has a real chance of getting into local uni compared to avg performing poly student,btohqsg
In poly more external factors will affect your GPA than it is for Rank points  i.e. luck in getting into a decent project group for every module. Bad teammates are incredibly a huge liability,btohqsg
Depends on major. I entered uni with 3.5.,btohqsg
Got no magic bullet answer to whether you should go JC or poly. There's a lot of factors that can contribute to the final outcome e.g. whether you need the major  your learning style  the major you want to enter  whether the major requires strong portfolio or additional requirement  whether you want to work first then get the degree due to reasons like financial issues or work exposure/experimentation  etc etc etc,btohqsg
What I can definitely say is now  compared to last time  there's many ways to upgrade your education like WSDip  WSDegree  and soon there will be WS for postgrads. Back then if you can't enter uni then your road is just gonna lead straight to the workforce until retirement.,btohqsg
i mean i entered uni with 3.23 LOL,btohqsg
definitely not easier to score.That's why it's tougher to get into uni through poly  on top of the myriad of other factors already mentioned.,btohqsg
Think I wasn't clear.JC isn't an easy route  it's stressful  it's a lot of work.But to think poly is easier is wrong too. Poly can be harder. It's easier if u want a cert to graduate with and start work. Not many wants to hire someone with just A level cert  but many want to hire with poly certs.But if u want to play the higher game and go into uni  many factors are against you. It's harder to score well consistently due to GPA requirements  and the quota to enter uni is lower.,btohqsg
that one surefire way to not fet uni alr piao,btohqsg
is there even any course that accepts ddd/d,btohqsg
theres no way u can cram lmao,btohqsg
sure but like i havent met a single person who managed to cram everyth in time or cram and scored well across his subjects,btohqsg
got one guy he crammed history all the way,btohqsg
quite solid but come out only a B,btohqsg
which i mean its nice but he didnt have time to cram the other subjects and ended up scoring D,btohqsg
ik a few (although it's v difficult),btohqsg
i mean he got where he wanted la but still if ur course is like 75>rp,btohqsg
but as a figure of speech it's possible to cram for jc while cannot do that for poly side,btohqsg
my strategy for busy JC 1 students for now is to focus heavily on 2 H2 subjects while coasting along for the 3rd one.Focus is the ultimate weapon.Dec of J1 is to focus on that 3rd one.Of course  if can do well in all  by all means go full steam ahead. Don't be limited by what I say.,btohqsg
My school idea is to get confidence in a 70 and immediately move on I think,btohqsg
So go JC meaning the 2 years is vigorous do or die type?,btohqsg
It's not even 2 years. You actually only have 20 months to really prep for A level.,btohqsg
it starts slowly and pace builds up by mid J1,btohqsg
Graduate from NUS/NTU vs SIT the starting pay are different?,btohqsg
Worth to do DSA JC by a Sports?,btohqsg
The Sports would it kill me since need to juggle A Level works?,btohqsg
It might. It might not.Some only start shining in JC. Tough to say,btohqsg
Heard some JC's retain many in JC1,btohqsg
NUS want enter this one need AAA/A,btohqsg
In this case  just select a JC near my place if to do A Level?,btohqsg
"Just work hard.But ""work hard"" means different things to different people",btohqsg
End of the day Elite JC  Neighbourhood JC all take the same A Level papers,btohqsg
I stay in hougang and chose JC in Buona Vista last time üòÖ,btohqsg
peer pressure and peer support different,btohqsg
Near home mean have more time to Z.zzzz,btohqsg
i studied on my hour+ bus ride home,btohqsg
Sadly so many JC's being merged!,btohqsg
imagine do that for 300 days over 2 years  that's 300 hours more.,btohqsg
Better take shower then go home?,btohqsg
Maybe look at Principal of JC?,btohqsg
Maybe consider MI 3 Yrs do A Level not so stress.,btohqsg
If fail GP still can go Uni?,btohqsg
I'm afraid my English cannot cope for GP,btohqsg
People said O Level English & GP different ball game,btohqsg
Uh dont get into this trap that 3 years is less stresful,btohqsg
Can take English Proficiency Test in NTU. NUS not so sure,btohqsg
some ppl started in year 2 july,btohqsg
not that i recommend that at all,btohqsg
You will need at least 3.8+ on the poly side fwiw,btohqsg
I ever took on a student scoring 13/100 in year 2 July.It was really intense,btohqsg
literally 4 chapters behind jcs right now,btohqsg
I think the teachers spend alot more time on each topic compared to jcs,btohqsg
You cant have 1-1 comparison. MI has its own stressors,btohqsg
survey send in the discord b4 it gets deleted by the admins,btohqsg
are you schools done with the syllabus for Os? I have a feeling my school's going wayyyy too slow,btohqsg
math yes  chem phy  ss/hist no,btohqsg
LOL if u rlly think so come here alr then talk,btohqsg
3 years not stress sures when u hv 2 promos and even if u fail by 0.01% u retain,btohqsg
i heard from my friend in MI its pretty stressful ü•≤,btohqsg
yea I did rather get the basics right,btohqsg
I have an MI Y3 student this year for Physics.He's hardworking üëçüí™If nothing goes wrong  I'm hoping he scores an A and worst case B.,btohqsg
Bec not enough people go Arts Stream?,btohqsg
So not profitable to make tys for those subjects?,btohqsg
Bec there were tys for humanities in Os,btohqsg
Still should be able to right,btohqsg
Ur sch should have past year a level papers for all subjects they offered tho,btohqsg
Just ask them to send it to you,btohqsg
How about try applying for study leave,btohqsg
I guess if they‚Äôre nice just convince them that you‚Äôre more productive at home than when being forced to come to sch,btohqsg
I mean I read on the news NY got some student did that cos the principal very good but i doubt other schs would be as flexible lol,btohqsg
hello guys! do y'll know how to improve for english paper 2 section B?,btohqsg
i did quite bad for eng WA2 and i'm worried that it'll affect me hard during MYE,btohqsg
