i got someone claiming to be from alipay calling me about some automatic payment deduction system and how my current balance would be charged a fee when i don‚Äôt even have an alipay account lmao,btohqsg
I think everyone‚Äôs been getting it. Almost got caught with it be careful everyone ‚òòÔ∏è,btohqsg
Yeah confirm  the other day just reported only,btohqsg
they are evolving sia  using local numbers now,btohqsg
i hang up they immediately call with another number,btohqsg
Heard they are not traceable I think,btohqsg
it's the same guy using the same few tactics LOLi got 10+ calls from different numbers and the same guy  asking me to help him with wechat verification??,btohqsg
yeah  once u check all these numbers with the ScamShield app-- it comes out unverified,btohqsg
Was wondering if telco can deactivate prepaid sim cards for misuse ...,btohqsg
oh is that why scamshield doesn‚Äôt seem to be blocking this few waves of scam callers,btohqsg
Speaking of scams be very careful about making friends online too... even video calls can be faked these days,btohqsg
all the e-telcos offering 5G contract plans,btohqsg
hard to say  a lot of solutions involving a company & government ends up being overcomplicated ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Anyone here going Poly or JC soon ?,btohqsg
Feels so weird to be in ach,btohqsg
Actually JC and Poly notes some are compatible with each other üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
The context was about my course lol,btohqsg
Wait ... kinematics? You mean like speed time graph and etc.,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall‚Äôs number on black market Ah,btohqsg
Why get called so often üòÇ,btohqsg
there's smth wrong with sg telcos,btohqsg
which i dare to say has affected at least 10% of ppl with a singapore contact number,btohqsg
Our education system is quite tolerant of failing üòÖüòÖ hear me out if you think otherwise.... ite is not designed to discriminate students as intended   it is more of a place for students with not so good grades to have a fresh start,btohqsg
Limit's more about the contrast with the common mindset with sg education  rather than the actual education system,btohqsg
Yeah it's true. Got some friends go ITE  then end up going to poly and smashing it. But mindset needs to change,btohqsg
what is commonly taught might not work the best for u,btohqsg
it's more of a trial and error process for every individual,btohqsg
Some ppl like me got lucky but not all are that lucky though  sure  studying is trial and error in a way but ppl like me got it right the first few tries while other people have to try more to discover how they should study and what path suits them,btohqsg
Besides   ite students are also important  they are responsible for fixing electrical supply lines and maintenance of equipment needed to empower communities  if somehow vocational education were to dissappear   many things will break down over time,btohqsg
