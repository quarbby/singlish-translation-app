girl with autism in my class,btohqsg
For me when I had to do groupings I realised I'm not sure abt the guys dynamics,btohqsg
"for convenience i just refer to her as the ""fmath girl"" for no reason",btohqsg
So I just ask the guy who I can talk to the most,btohqsg
Actually this is not in my ‘friends’ criteria unless they disturb my studies,btohqsg
I mean it delivers the pt,btohqsg
to quote my friend in math Olympiad: you'll know her when you see her,btohqsg
But they dont (only 1 person but im not big enough to kick her out coz there are 5 other ppl),btohqsg
putting this in the nicest way possible,btohqsg

Can understand the tilt if too disruptive,btohqsg

Coz in NJ  those ppl were just made to make public apology,btohqsg
But just think of it as it is not her fault,btohqsg
easier said than done ah defo,btohqsg
our class still cannot see past her autism,btohqsg
some girls are still nice enough to accomodate her,btohqsg
Ok saying from someone w an autistic bro  but I understand it can be difficult to accept it and not be rough on it,btohqsg
At least got support ah ig,btohqsg
But ya broski hang in thr?,btohqsg
Got ppl w her for breaks or is she alone,btohqsg
tbh now that i think abt it ms pang talking to us abt her did jackshit,btohqsg

i imagine every cher has been briefed on her alr lma9,btohqsg
