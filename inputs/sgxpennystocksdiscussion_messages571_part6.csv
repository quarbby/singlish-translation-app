From a SG unknown writer...**The biggest crisis facing Singapore is this: our Night Safari lions have Covid. And this has implications for all us humans.The story starts with four Asiatic lions coughing and sneezing. Naturally  they reported sick.The Animal & Veterinary Service diagnosed these cats with Covid. I am unsure which brave AVS employee carried out the swab tests on the lions’ noses. That person deserves a medal.AVS issued an order under the Animals and Birds Act to isolate their lions to their respective dens. Basically  the lions now have to work from home. They will have to Zoom from the Zoo.Singaporeans are demanding answers:How did the lions catch the virus?Did the lions wear masks?Did the lions dine together in groups of four? Was recorded music played (we know how dangerous that can be)?Did the zookeepers use masking tape to mark “X”s all over the lions’ cages  so that the lions would know where to sit while eating?I want to know: do lions socially distance themselves from other animals? Or will we see other Night Safari creatures infected too?Imagine how cross an elephant would be  if it had a runny nose and kept sneezing. It would need a lot of Kleenex.A giraffe with a sore throat would also be problematic  because of the vast quantities of cooling tea it would need from the sinseh.As it turns out  three keepers have tested positive for Covid  and they could have infected these lions. Or did the lions infect these keepers? At any rate  we hope the keepers will recover soon.With this news  Singapore has shot to the top of the international charts: our country has the most lions infected with Covid  per capita.This situation has arisen because we do not have a campaign to educate lions about vaccination. Our vaccination rate among lions is 0%. We need to raise it to above 80%  especially among elderly lions (those with grey manes).Fortunately  there doesn’t appear to be an anti-vax movement among wildlife. They seem to be smarter than humans  in that regard.🤣🤣,btohqsg
