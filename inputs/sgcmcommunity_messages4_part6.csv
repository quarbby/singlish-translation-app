But the Interior like the first swift sport sia,btohqsg
"I still felt ""mid hybrid"" marketing is so....misleading. Riding on the real hybrid hype",btohqsg
Mild hybrid is just nonsense imo,btohqsg
Esp for e newer cars  esp if paying for catB,btohqsg
Not driving a mild hybrid  but I thought fc is slightly better?,btohqsg
Mild Hybrids are the true free riders of hybrid marketing,btohqsg
Can't vouch for that  since my car is so old that it is still carburetted. lol,btohqsg
anyone driving honda n van? review please,btohqsg
Doesnt feel like it.If i cruise or long distance all the way maybe. Other than that there’s not much visible savings,btohqsg
I saw afew on the road LOL CUte,btohqsg
Mild hybrid power up the electronics via the battery instead of the energy generated from the car engine(via petrol),btohqsg
How about considering Epower ? Like NOTE ?,btohqsg
Using 92 Octane can power up that car and is EV in a way,btohqsg
can't wait for the day when every lot in hdb carpark got ev charger,btohqsg
Pray to Guanyinma cause if u lucky ur side will install first but lol sure messed up,btohqsg
Cause sure install low levels first if MSCP then all EV will snatch those lots or its reserved for them lol then u have to park way up lol. LOL,btohqsg
Install 1-2 spots no use one,btohqsg
must all lots have then ppl will start buying ev,btohqsg
But pioneering in certain areas for now only,btohqsg
Still expensive SG is not moving towards EV so fast. They can tax u on petrol they will thats why lol,btohqsg
Road Tax on EVs are Horrendous,btohqsg
must wait lor haha. I'll only consider ev when charging points readily available.,btohqsg
or i win toto stay landed,btohqsg
I think the review is probably in Japanese...Dun think SG has yet,btohqsg
Just change and u will find ways to live with it =D,btohqsg
Hahaha Condos have le dun need landed,btohqsg
imagine everyone hogging the charging point then you dunnid go work liao,btohqsg
Go msia get landed and install fast charger there,btohqsg
mscp small cannot tow them out also hahahah,btohqsg
reach checkpoint no battery liao hahahaha,btohqsg
EV6 coming out hope is reasonable price,btohqsg
It will be a sight to see Petrol station slowly close down as electric cars takes over.,btohqsg
Actually no   entry level ev road tax is 1.5 k around there   but your petrol saving is easily 300 a month   and the arf rebate of 40 k   defiantly is a saving,btohqsg
300 a month is based on a usage like an average family car,btohqsg
Rebate u know when u scrap car its factored in? LOL,btohqsg
Gov dont give rebates for nth LOL like HDB,btohqsg
The arf rebate is given at the time of car purchase so if your car is 140 k the rebate will lessen it to 100 k and   if you do 100% loan it will be 100k loan instead of a 140 k loanYou can look at the 2nd hand price of ev cars and the value is holding very well.You can go and search like tesla used car and compare to new car price,btohqsg
LoL they just become ev station...I think their existence requires super speed charging e.g. full charge under 5 mins just like refuelling,btohqsg
Another example is if your car price is 100 k but u buy an ice with a surcharge of $20 k instead of rebate   it will cost you 120 k for the car and you will be paying 120 k price loan   but if the car is 100 k and the rebate is 60 k u only need to pay for 60K car loan,btohqsg
Currently with the ev rebate of 40 k   paying for ice car is really just pay too much for nothing,btohqsg
But of course hybrid got some rebate also la   just using a general example   as alot of ppl don’t seems bother about this rebate,btohqsg
What u gonna do to ev hoggers? If they hog the lot after full charge. U cant charge also. No doubt they will be charged idle fee  but u also LL,btohqsg
that's why i say every lot in mscp ma,btohqsg
Idle fee is like $1 per minute   hog 1 hour is $60,btohqsg
With that idle charging fee will deter just like ERP,btohqsg
Out of whole mscp if got 5 alrdy damn good,btohqsg
Some ppl rich and wallet damn deep. What is $60 to them lol,btohqsg
Others will follow as it is good money,btohqsg
There shld be a force release function in the app when its full charge to allow e next user to disconnect,btohqsg
But $60 is not like that waste also,btohqsg
