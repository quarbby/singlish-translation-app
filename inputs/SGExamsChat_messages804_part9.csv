If you are counting CS total assets  shareholders got less than 1 cent per dollar of total assets. Total  not net,btohqsg
But they screwed over AT1 holders even more,btohqsg
U haven't seen their bond holders,btohqsg
Technically that shouldnt have happened  shares should have been wiped out before bonds,btohqsg
It was the dictat of the swiss govt that wiped out at1,btohqsg
The Saudis own 20% of the shares.,btohqsg

You don't just say on tv that you're not gonna invest any more in a bank that you invested a lot in,btohqsg
By that standard  a lot of Temasek would already be dead by now,btohqsg
We don't just rely on Temasek for SG,btohqsg
Temasek made a number of questionable investments,btohqsg
Temasek was made for the higher risk investments..,btohqsg
Of course  every investment fund will make terrible investments once in a while,btohqsg
You can't beat the one where they put 150m in a nigerian gas company that went broke,btohqsg
I don't think u seem to understand. SG layers it's holdings,btohqsg
Temasek is basically the government Venture Capital and hedge fund. High risk but high returns.,btohqsg
Of course. But the failures have entertainment value,btohqsg
Of course  one would expect a portion of high risk investments to fail,btohqsg
Now how did we get drawn into this conversation,btohqsg

Basically sell a put and buy a put but at a wider strike price.,btohqsg

He would be a great FA talk cock and tell me things I already experienced,btohqsg
