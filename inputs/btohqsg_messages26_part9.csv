Sbf in feb next year.. now only once a year. Only will know the offerings then. Depends if people give up their unit,btohqsg
Most units is taken up. Unless u don't mind level 2,btohqsg
If There is sbf u can wait but I'll advise to go for any launch first  not sure Yishun Beacon will still out any sbf or not since this yr no have,btohqsg
Sometimes people back out like financial or breakups. I ever seen post on hwz about many good units in urbanville being offered as sbf. Too bad i couldnt apply then,btohqsg
Location is quite central within Yishun. Very unlikely.,btohqsg

Is there any group for bukit batok oct launch please?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know where these subsidies will be reflected? Is it in terms of the already released prices of the BTO or will it be topped up as additional grants?,btohqsg
Previously PLH is already reflected in sale price - so I suppose it should be the same this time,btohqsg
Is the launch likely to be this week?,btohqsg
Hi all  just curious for the new LTV of 25%  does it mean that we can only take the moderate loan amount stated in HFE? The maximum amount states MSR of 30%  not sure if Iâ€™m mixing it up. Or does it simply mean that down payment is increased from 20% to 25%?,btohqsg
True. Thats why those with bad credit report can still apply hdb loan but not bank loan,btohqsg
