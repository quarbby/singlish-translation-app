I want to buy lambo liao,btohqsg
End up is we just repackage salonpas,btohqsg
salonpas on the chinchin is gonna burn tho,btohqsg
I wanted manual and that was the only one in CAT A that is recent,btohqsg
But got some bad news also,btohqsg
The 1.4T hybrid is not exactly as modable as the normal 33s,btohqsg
Japan never sold the hybrid  it is for Europe only,btohqsg
Your parts support all have to be from Europe. Not Japan,btohqsg
suspension parts most of them  if not all  can be fitted.,btohqsg
engine most of them cannot. Including air intake.,btohqsg
Guys for heavy footers is golf a bad choice due to dsg,btohqsg
You need to find europe tuners to make aftermarket parts for the hybrid 33s,btohqsg
DSG is a bad choice doesn't matter what foot you have,btohqsg
ohh wow ok I didn't know this... haha I went to garage r and project s they both said have parts that can be installed,btohqsg
Chu Chu sound from the blow of valve,btohqsg
Eh. Holland V the open air cp and the mscp all gone already ?,btohqsg
The engine block itself is the same K14,btohqsg
ok the funny thing is garage R specialise in the non hybrid 33s,btohqsg
So likely is they won't know the other stuff until they played it,btohqsg
if i am not wrong the main block is the same,btohqsg
but your engine has integrated motor assist,btohqsg
just waiting for an exhaust to be legal then will probably change intercooler  downpipe and exhaust then go for a tune,btohqsg
Can look brands like remus and ask them to get it legalized for you,btohqsg
"My exhaust is the one and only in sg too from remus. Cos my car also not ""JDM""",btohqsg
Can just stick to PJS and ask them what mods they have. and go from there,btohqsg
but also becareful of raymond's pushy sales tactic,btohqsg
He will sell you things you dont need and make you buy them,btohqsg
