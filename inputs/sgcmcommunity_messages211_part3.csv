Yes lta is going to next phrase ev world,btohqsg
This BYD also changed a lot of buyers mindset. They are so affordable price with lots of good features. Buyer really don’t mind paying abit more to get BYD,btohqsg
BYD M6 is 170k17k depreThe closed Toyota wish is 12-14k depre nowWho wants wish? Haha,btohqsg
Truth however the drive experience isn’t great,btohqsg
It’s the technology and QOL that makes BYD stand out,btohqsg
They are a “pseudo” Tesla   some people draw this comparison,btohqsg
I feel that its about changing of mindset. Ppl used to get toyota cause its less trouble due to less tech. But now ppl buying full tech car. How the paradigm has shift,btohqsg
Not all and u didn’t realise there are so many used EV car in the used market also.,btohqsg
So ya. ICE will be in our hearts but embrace EV with open mind.,btohqsg
I really hope that there’s less “misinformation”,btohqsg
Ya actually I won’t mind to get EV also but to me 1st priority is convenience which I mean charging station is like anytime readily available and do not have worries that I need to plug out after full charge. If I stay in landed house definitely no brainer to get an EV car.,btohqsg
True.. Ya my hdb open carpark till now still no charging station yet. Maybe next time when readily available then I will consider changing. My working place the number of EV cars which I can see is less than my 1 🤚 also..,btohqsg
One can liao. Ur IDP will say which country can use,btohqsg
Actually I’m an owner myself with no landed charging. I don’t feel it’s that much of an issue actually.It’s just a routine change.,btohqsg
It’ll come eventually. Just need moreTime.,btohqsg
Waiting... my carpark still dh despite the surronding areas starting to have bluesg,btohqsg
Yes just need more time. EV in Sg still need lots of improvement.. Eventually all will changed.,btohqsg
