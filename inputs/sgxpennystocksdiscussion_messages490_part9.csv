"Ask Pika Nat Series #2Question: Why did you think the mid-cycle transition is a big deal?Background on the Pace of RecoveryThanks for the question  and let us renew-wind back to the pandemic situation. First  The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) had the Covid-19 recession was in the past in May 2020. This is the shortest and steepest recession in history  given that it lasts only for 2 months.The recovery was swiftly given the tremendous fiscal and monetary stimulus from the Federal government to back-stop the economy rather than kick-start the economy. However  this method is not standard compared to the past crisis.While this might be old news to many  it helped explain the markets' movement  such as the peak and swift V-shaped recovery we had seen in the stock market  as Pika World deemed a ""compression"" where economic cycles are moving faster than usual.The effective vaccines and fast pace digitalisation had helped shift the gear of the economy with higher output  leading to an uneven recovery across different sectors of the market but in general pulling the economy out of the deep trough.Characteristic of the Mid-Cycle TransitionAnd that is why consistent with most analysts; Pika World had updated a new paradigm shift on the ""mid-cycle transition"" in April/ May. It simply means that while the US economy is still rebounding  we anticipated that the rate of growth would moderate sooner than in the past economic recovery cycle. This is because it usually takes a year for the economy to reach the cycle's peak  but the period is primarily shortened in this environment. Therefore  earnings growth is likely to have peaked.Second  the equity market bull may start to narrow  given that few stocks will be able to keep up with the swift pace of the initial recovery.Third  we would observe leadership tends to move away from sectors that would benefit from the re-opening trade  primarily the cyclical  that perform best during the early signs of economic recovery. This can include retailers  homebuilders  semiconductors (selective few facing headwinds )  and transport.Finally  we would see the Fed that will begin tapering to tighten the monetary policy  leading to rising interest rates. As a result  it will weigh on equity valuations  especially on long-duration stocks.What have we seen?Since March  we have seen that the peak of growth is almost behind us  and leadership of the stocks have largely moved away from cyclical to higher-quality stocks that typically perform well outperform in this part of the cycle.The final cycle is yet to come  and if they do  they should have a profound impact on the indices. And the fact that the indices are resilient despite a narrow breadth of equity recovery can be attributed to the fall in the long term interest rate  such as the 10-year Treasury.What's next?Pika World does think that the administration could start to worry about inflation. If it turns out to be structural  it can have detrimental effects on the mid-term election next year. The Fed  while independent  may feel the need to start some forms of tapering to level off some heated inflation. The Fed is also mindful that any prolonged delay in tightening will lead to a highten pace in the future and threaten the smooth recovery.Therefore  Pika World does not see the current interest rate environment as compatible with the rosy economic outlook and expects to rise. As a result  the equity market should bake in discounts soon. As such  we maintain overweight sectors in this transiton process with high weightage on defensive sectors such as healthcare and consumer staples (yeah  it is a contrarian play) and re-start our engine on financials as a hedge as the Fed begins its tightening process.Good night or morning whenever you read this!Cheers Pika Nat.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a larger audience.",btohqsg
