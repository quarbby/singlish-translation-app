to be fair  jianhao tan has multiple channels & runs a mini media agency for his brand as well,btohqsg
he's more of a businessman now,btohqsg
Otherwise is Zermatt for his Mukbang.,btohqsg
he just does his comedic skits every now and then,btohqsg
But then I feel SGAG loosing its touch edi,btohqsg
i had to pause for a moment to remember who this was,btohqsg
The guy with the black hole stomach lol,btohqsg
to be fair  sgag was more of a meme page that grew to a local brand to shit post on things legally,btohqsg
