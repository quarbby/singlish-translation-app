Some educational post on double dojis. Link as embedded and can ownself go study too. Now  using this in reference to Oxley which has been in a slump/ downtrend for some time.Note:- it was approx $0.60 in Feb 18  $0.38 in Jan 20c  $0.27 in April 21- Now in Sept24  it’s trading at $0.075 (NAV: $0.194 as per ShareInvestor)Extract: ‘the significance of 2 dojis appearing together could potentially forecast a reversal or continuation’In Oxley case  the probability IMP to reverse upwards is higher as they look to have hit a super bottom.- Company doing SBB at $0.071 to $0.075 recently  even yesterday.- they been actively buying back shares from market as high as $0.10 this year.- Double Doji at end of downtrend  with technical support level $0.075 and MACD golden cross up.Tried some yesterday.DYODD / OSODSource:https://www.ripsanddips.net/double-doji-meaning/,btohqsg
But more importantly IMO is that Oxley has presence in China too with Sino-Singapore Health City.Based on observation  the group of recent BBs that are playing the pennies- have mainly been playing up the chinese related/linked counters.- pumping up pennies that are illiquid and ‘light’Anyways  hope our market will be alive for some time but do know that there is no Bao Jiak  pennies are generally the most risky asset class.. If these BBs come to play  the upwards/downwards movement can be equally as fast and if the music/game stops  if you are still hanging on  you might potentially be stucked 4 life!Reminder:Hence  DYODD/OSOD and react according if you even decide to enter any countersFor me  if I see any counter that I enter  if PA not good  i will react and cut ✂️ accordingly. I have many in freezer already and do not want to add in any speculative type counters.Source:https://www.oxley.com.sg/portfolio/%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%B0%E5%81%A5%E5%BA%B7%E5%9F%8E-sino-singapore-health-city/,btohqsg
China International Holdings responded to SGX query that they were not aware of any event that could have caused the price to rise and have no possible explanation for that.Sadly enough  a significant independent shareholder threw shares the day prior in the $0.04x range before yesterday mad pump. Would have cried the whole day if I were him. Not sure how long he held but surely will be damn sian.Anyways  if BBs come to play  they don’t need any catalyst as we can see. They just pump and dump only  like musical chair games  last one standing will not have a seat and will be eliminated.Play safe everyone. If hoot any of those  you know it’s merely gambling. And gambling 🎰 casino  means  always be prepared to lose all. If you are not prepared  then stay the hell of these counters. Because when they dump  High chance  gonna get burnt and stucked. Question is when they decide to stop the music only.,btohqsg

The investing journey can be challenging  filled with ups and downs. It's important to remember that investing involves risk  and there's no guarantee of profits. However  the potential rewards can be significant.TA-BAO (Takeaways):• Long term perspective: Investing is often a long term endeavor. It's important to stay focused on your goals and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations.• Continuous learning: The investing landscape is constantly evolving  so it's essential to stay informed and continue learning.• Diversification: Spreading your investments across different asset classes can help manage risk and improve returns.• Emotional discipline: It's crucial to maintain emotional discipline and avoid making decisions based on fear or greed.• Market Sentiment: If you believe the market is overvalued or a correction is imminent  selling some of your gains might be prudent. Afterall money in your pocket never goes wrong.• Cut Your Losses: If an investment continues to underperform and you believe it's unlikely to recover  it might be time to cut your losses and reinvest the funds elsewhere.• Portfolio Rebalancing: Selling a gain or loss making investment can help rebalance your portfolio and maintain your desired asset allocation.These are just my personal opinions. It's always a good idea to do your own due diligence before making any financial commitments.Your investment success is personal. Don't get caught up in comparing yourself to others. Focus on building a portfolio that works for you.I'm not a financial guru  my aim is to generate some passive income to enjoy a more comfortable life.Stay safe  stay vested & stay huat. 🍍🍍,btohqsg
This formula still valid to me,btohqsg
Cutting losses to me are the most important. Take care of the downside  the upside will take care by itself. Many lose big $$$$ becos they didn’t take care of the downside.,btohqsg
