Not yet  next Friday will be 14 le,btohqsg
So loan approval completely depends on you,btohqsg
And if you're so worried about driving off the day you decide,btohqsg
Loan  insurance all will always take time,btohqsg
Sometimes lesser sometimes more based on requirement and profile,btohqsg
I'd reckon if you back off,btohqsg
Wait for a week or two,btohqsg
It’s crazy  they told me TDSR no issue  CBS AA also  but apparently I’ve an in house loan of 3k with courts then their in house isn’t willing to loan the amount for what I need LOL,btohqsg
Because the dealership admins are instructed to drop prices at fixed intervals for everyday,btohqsg
Unless you're on a high loan,btohqsg
Not full loan but not 30% also,btohqsg
So it’s only in house left lor,btohqsg
No bank/dealer will ask u dp more or shorten period for no good reason. They want to earn less meh haha,btohqsg
Yea today they dropped price and then when ask about it they quickly rectify and raise back the price LOL,btohqsg
The 7k extra for install this and that seems worth now but ur paying interest on that 7k,btohqsg
Higher dp = higher chance loan approval - ish,btohqsg
Yes because admin will just drop at fixed interval,btohqsg
Close eyes on 500 and run,btohqsg
So you can choose to walk away,btohqsg
Unless you take in house loan 6.98% 100% approval that one,btohqsg

My prev car is COE A5  pump petrol every 2 days until cry LOL,btohqsg
It actually doesn't seem to be too much  most cars of similar age and MILEAGE are about 178k as well and 183 you never negotiate meh?,btohqsg
Ea888 since when got so bad,btohqsg
What random tune were you running sir,btohqsg
But if you're filling up every 2 days,btohqsg
Either there's something seriously wrong with your right foot,btohqsg
Or something seriously wrong with your tune and car condition,btohqsg
A friend with a b9 A4 with a weird tune was averaging 4km/l as well,btohqsg
But he also has a very heavy right foot,btohqsg
After fixing tune closer to 10km/l alr,btohqsg
I won’t deny I quite heavy footed la,btohqsg
Green light full throttle those type,btohqsg
Ya lah then the tune no good also,btohqsg
Must tune for more torque low end,btohqsg
Your tuner anyhow slap piggyback or what,btohqsg
Of course will not get any fuel economy,btohqsg
I don’t mind la  not important to me now,btohqsg
