I see  that sounds like a good idea haha. Okay thank you! üòÅ,btohqsg
If no rebates cn just use trust bank / youtrip etc for the favourable rates ah,btohqsg
Does anyone here know if we can use cardup or ipaymy to pay for town council bills ?,btohqsg
Try to explore if you can buy it from Krisshop using UOB Lady Solitaire.If it is feasible  max rewards will be 6mpd x $3k = 18 000 miles.If Atome + HSBC Revo is acceptable  then you can get 4mpd by splitting into few months of payments with max $1k/month,btohqsg
thank you  and this will have to be under travel category right?,btohqsg
Krisshop is under travel mcc ?? According to heymax is mcc 5309. Dont think its part of uob ladies travel category,btohqsg
You can search an article ‚Äúuob lady travel mcc‚Äù using google on this.,btohqsg
5309 duty free store are included under lady solitaire travel according to mileslions,btohqsg
Yup saw in the article alr. Haha then yeah mayb buy from there better. If the price is the same,btohqsg
Went to check out the Krisflyer Travel Fair at Suntec this morning. Seems a bit overhyped.Any value from it that others have seen besides the lucky draw?,btohqsg
dun worry i bought M Log @2.04 before and dca for 4years alr to current avg of 1.78 so its a long term game,btohqsg
saw trips to bkk at $215 and danang at $307,btohqsg
Does anyone know about how Instarem makes money? The pairing of your Master credit card  recognizing your selected  category and getting 6mpd plus additional FX discounts seems too good to be true.,btohqsg
Earning frm the FX spread of coz :),btohqsg

Isn't that what CPF is for? Forced savings for retirement. SRS won't grow your money. Still have to decide where you want to park your SRS to grow it.,btohqsg
Is your DCA done manually  at what frequency?,btohqsg
manually  once a mth whenever salary comes in,btohqsg
CDP or custodian? You pay a lot of comm,btohqsg
CDP  not rlly Tiger has alot of comm free vouchers to use which keeps it $2 or below,btohqsg
But tiger brokers is custodised account with CDP  not under your name. Tiger got any dividend handling charges?,btohqsg

nope not that i know of as i receive all my dividends in full,btohqsg
not rlly a big issue for me as i still have direct control over the shares i own,btohqsg
Wow for sure you are rich haha. Think you need assess whether buying at krisshop using uob lady solitaire earning 8-10 mpd but cap at 3k is better than buying in store and split cards each earning 4mpd. Or get UOB KF card with no cap.,btohqsg
Hihi   why is the 540 divided by the 71k ? Shouldn‚Äôt it be 540/25k miles ? Since we can just get away with spending 1k on foreign and local spending and don‚Äôt pay the annual free and just get the 23k+23k miles right ? So technically I‚Äôm buying the 25k miles for $540. Anybody can clarify ? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
hi  anyone using HSBC everyday global account  can advise if giro pmt for income tax  insur  etc still eligible for 1% cashback?  cos it seems not eligible in the terms and conditions,btohqsg
Yes it is  unless you ask hsbc cso then they will tell you it isn‚Äôt. üòÇ,btohqsg
yup  that's what hsbc cso said and referred me to the terms and conditions in the website,btohqsg
Hi gurus  can1. DBS Live Fresh cc 2. Citi SMRT ccbe used with Xnap for hawker food ?Will being a VISA or Mastercard make a difference?Thank you!,btohqsg
DBS Live Fresh yes  counts as Online.,btohqsg
No differenceHowever im not sure if Citi SMRT works  think it's only for online payments (Citi has a weird way to classify mobile payments),btohqsg
Thank you both  Yu Oh and Joseph :))How about Citi cashback+?,btohqsg
If you keep calling cso  it will become no 1% in the future. The best is to ask this chat group first if you have any query.,btohqsg
u read terms and condition wrongly bah  where got say not eligible?,btohqsg
Anyone knows the miles earned from HSBC TravelOne can be combined with the miles earned from HSBc Revol? Thank you.,btohqsg
It will become not eligible in the future if anybody keeps calling CSO on this. The more people call  the more nerf we get.,btohqsg
Is medical/dental excluded for Citi Rewards?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  anyone know about standard chart smart card singsaver 250 spend and card 388 spend is it link tgt or it give separate cash and cashback,btohqsg
I sign up afew day before 30nov,btohqsg
The giro 1 percent cashback is big big on website. Dont understand why call will nerf the benefit,btohqsg
i cant find it in their t&c,btohqsg
If u dont see it excluded meam it is included,btohqsg
by included u mean can get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Grab wallet top up using some credit cards used to have cashback/miles big big on website too before  but now‚Ä¶‚Ä¶üôÅThere are many similar examples in the past if you are long enough in this games to know this.,btohqsg
U need to tag with amaze which will incur 1 percent amaze fee but get 4 mpd from citi,btohqsg
Asking or not actually dont really matter if u ask me  it is in bank book to see if the promo work then benefit cut due to costing once they hit their accquired target,btohqsg
Just like how chocolate finance closed once target hit and gxs closed after they reach certain amt of customer,btohqsg
So enjoy while u can because once company hit their target number they shut the door.,btohqsg
oh ya. then maybe HSBC revolute paywave better,btohqsg
