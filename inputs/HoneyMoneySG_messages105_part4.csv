Yep! Is there. My salary credited amt is gone though lol,btohqsg

~$5 but I can’t even make sense of Mar’s int like how they calculateWhat’s the UOB One bonus interest formula?,btohqsg
Anyone can help me understand the mab calculation  let’s say I have 7k in 1st May and 20k in 2nd May  shouldn’t my MAB be like 19k or smth?,btohqsg
note that transaction on 1 May is dated 2 May,btohqsg
No transactions done on 1st May. I did the deposit on 2nd May itself before night. 7k was my available balance. So I did calculation like 7k+(20k x 30)/31,btohqsg
No lah. I guess that hawker is not in eligible hawker list.,btohqsg
Uob one bonus interest received today.👍,btohqsg
ok  the MAB is for what purpose? actually u calculate actual MAB for May after u know the end balance for everyday in May.,btohqsg
Just wanted to verify what they are showing on the ocbc web is accurate. There won’t be any transactions in and out of this account for this month. So the current amount is fixed,btohqsg
Try this formula (($7k x 2)+($20k x 28))/30Edited…,btohqsg
Why 27k? The current balance is only 20,btohqsg
Oh. You deposit $13k not $20k on 2nd May?,btohqsg
Try this formula (($7k x 2)+($20k x 28))/30,btohqsg
Still different  the web show as 13k ish only,btohqsg
Not wrong ah  20k plus 7k equal 27k divide by 2 day is 13.5k mab,btohqsg
Ohh they don’t show like a full month ahead? Coz i always tot like it will show full month then if there’s any transaction they will update again. So as the days goes by it will increase ?,btohqsg
