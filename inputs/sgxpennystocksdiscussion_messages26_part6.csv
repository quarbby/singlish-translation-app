TG not really affected by the recent sell down,btohqsg
MT from 1.6 to 0.9+VP from 0.6 to 0.3Aspen from 0.2+ to 0.1+,btohqsg
Hope tomorrow another upward trend. Cannot be one hit wonder only,btohqsg
Look at PE ratio and eps guys  don’t follow the herd,btohqsg
Shares supposed to make you side income  not supposed to make you panic every minute,btohqsg
Pls buy the companies with strong fundamentals,btohqsg
It's not easy if you buy MT at 1.6 and see it drop to 0.9,btohqsg
But it’s a stock that worth $2 at least,btohqsg
It’s obviously manipulated by the bbs,btohqsg
And bbs are in this chat la,btohqsg
So trust yourself  don’t anyhow lose your hard earned money,btohqsg
Even if we know its manipulation it's not easy sometimes,btohqsg
Just my 2 cents worth la,btohqsg
The share doesnt know how much you bought,btohqsg
You buy 1 lot or 100 lots,btohqsg
It will still behave in the same manner,btohqsg
TP whatever is comfortable to you. Everyone’s TP is different  don’t need to chase 2.88  3.88 or whatever.Realized profits are better than paper numbers,btohqsg
It's human nature to buy  when high and sell when low,btohqsg
To you 100 lots may be a lot  but to funds might be very little haha,btohqsg
