Don’t buy too big weight bcos you don’t want to liquidate so much at one time. You only need to liquidate what you need to use in future. I buy 1oz gold. For silver I buy 100oz bar. Don’t pay for design etc pay high premium for it. For gold with design premium not big so is ok but not silver. Silver is industrial n precious metal n before fiat money people made payments with silver. Don’t buy paper or cert type dangerous bcos not fully backed. Not convert all cash to this but a portion of your portfolio lah,btohqsg
Oh yea .. good idea .. 👍👍 thank for sharing,btohqsg
Physical Silver damn heavy to bring to metal exchange to cash out,btohqsg
but worth its weight compared to gold,btohqsg
1oz Gold can buy 80oz of silver,btohqsg
When I bought it was $2.3k then it peaked at almost $4k within 6 months but of course sale price was less than $4k. Silver’s buy sell spread is much bigger than gold so need to up more before profit but I buy to keep to preserve value of my money savings I no sell type. Warren buffet does not like gold silver bcos he says does not generate money fast enough. Maybe bcos he buys n sells in USD whereas we buy in USD converted to s$ n sell in s$ so hv currency conversion  lol,btohqsg
Can bring Gold/Silver bars from/to overseas?,btohqsg

Buying property in SG and buying property in MY are 2 different processes altogether... Don't assume things that worked in SG will work in MY,btohqsg

Added Abundance $0.030.This price is based IMO and with AnAn sudden push up  this china based might be dragged up along since it fell without any sell down volume.Just removal of liquidity.Furthermore  Sam Kok Yin have bought at $0.030. Downside is too limited. Good Risk RewardDYODD.PS: Abundance will be easy double bag by 2023.(Put here for reference),btohqsg
