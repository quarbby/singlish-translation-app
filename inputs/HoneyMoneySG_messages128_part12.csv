I had experience working through with HSBC when filling up dispute form was the norm. As u know  pending transactions are pending posting. So  u can only dispute on a charge on your card (posted transaction) . Don't worry about the retrieval charge. If the merchant cannot provide proof of your spending to defend the alleged claim by u within a deadline  the transaction would be reversed.,btohqsg
Thank u very much for replying. Just a bit concerned because I found reddit threads with people having the same issue but took very long to resolve,btohqsg
Such issue takes time because merchants are given time to show cause that you use your card to consume their service (to be fair to both parties). Based on your sharing here  you and your card did not enter UK. It is a matter of time that you would be 'vindicated'. I would suggest u get the concurrence from hsbc not to pay the Ubereats GBP charge.,btohqsg
To add  fradulent transactions are common nowadays. The industry has SOPs and playbook to handle. Merchant buys commercial insurance to protect themselves from fradulent transactions. I have worked with banks over the years to resolve amount from $100 to more than $10 000. As long as we are honest  truthful and keep the banks reasonable information as they request  we would be fine at the end of the day.,btohqsg
Just an update on this. After checking with CSO  it is 2%per year.,btohqsg
thank you very much!! honestly speaking  to give hsbc credit as it is due i have been constantly impressed by hsbc's customer service at least on things they are able to help or clarify on such as giro arrangements errors etc. the security verification procedures in terms of phone and ibanking has been seemingly more thorough than other banks tooi have had other banks with different csos within same bank telling me different stuff  beyond and outside the tnc on their websites when i call/chat with enquiriesjust caught off guard and scratching my head this time round,btohqsg
Pleasure is mine. Glad to be allowed to weigh in on your case here. My experiences are with Maybank  OCBC  UOB and HSBC. I shall not make comparisons because every case is unique.If I may add another point  be professional  objective and consistent when working and communicating with banks on fradulent charges. It is a shared responsibility between a bank and a customer in handling fradulent charges.,btohqsg
So far all my disputes are resolved quite immediate,btohqsg
Possible to not allow deletion of messages?,btohqsg
Next time who asks questions and got answers then delete his/her message  me and my admin will screenshot the deleted messages and post big big so don;t bother deleting.,btohqsg
Latest T bills results really disappointing. 3.13%,btohqsg
Not first time this is happening  always like that. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Sure. Here we mainly discuss personal finance related topics. What do you want to ask?,btohqsg
It's way worse than I thought,btohqsg
I'm currently having 2 main cards that I'm using which is OCBC 360  and N90.For any daily usage I'll use 360 which will try to hit 800 in combine.And any big usage N90 to get mile points.As such would like to check is there any better ways to maximise my CC usage with any app combine?,btohqsg
Maybe they dont want to confuse people?,btohqsg
If u only use 90n card sparely  it will take really long time to accumulate enough miles for any redemptions. Consider a generic cashback instead? Like ocbc infinity?,btohqsg
Hi everyone. Really trying my luck here..May I ask if anyone has any method to split up GIRO payment of a big credit card bill over 2 months (other than paying min sum and incur interest)?I am asking becos i have charged a huge bill this month for tour package payment >40k. If whole sum is paid by my HSBC GIRO next month  the everday+ reward would hit limit. Any method to split over 2 months?,btohqsg
upgrade to Premier Banking. Cap is $500,btohqsg
I‚Äôve asked travel agent to split the bill into 2 payments before.One part pay this month.  Another part pay next month.,btohqsg
Ya. Already charged. Becos of natas fair gifts. Haha. But nonetheless u both of u have been really helpful on this!I have upgraded to premier few days ago. So if i do the sms  and transfers 1st Oct  i shd be able to get cashback up to the new $500 limit.üôè,btohqsg
Any way  just curious and wondering if there is ever a need to split CC payments for such purpose  any methods to do so?,btohqsg
depends on when they amend your status in the system  try to see your app... under Settings  whether you see the word Premier or not,btohqsg
How did you upgrade to premier?,btohqsg
I walked into a branch to fill a form. And few days later upgraded and received the premier debit card also,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I sign up for the hsbc ega today can I still get the interest rewards?,btohqsg
Yup! looks the same as ur screenshot. Has the premier wordüòÅBtw.. how did u do screenshot on hsbc app  my samsung blocks my phone from taking screenshot.. üôà,btohqsg
then should be OK liao!! good luck!!,btohqsg
If u sign up today  u can register for the next round promo  probably on 1st Oct.,btohqsg
"Maybe.. i didnt catch ur meaning of ""sign up"". U mean send in sms to register for the everyday+ rewards?",btohqsg
My case was within a week. But i think they reversed the full amount without charging the 5 bucks Cant remember this part exactly.,btohqsg
If u didnt complete the sign-up and activities (sms + transfer in + 5 transactions) means no bonus everyday+ interest as per the hsbc tnc.,btohqsg
for ega jun-jul promotion  means will only get the bonus interest in oct?,btohqsg
Does amaze + Citi rewards earn 4mpd for GP clinic payments?,btohqsg
if sms register today  can get 3.x% for Aug and Sep for incremental monthly average balance wrt Julif done 2k/5k transfer in and 5 Aug transactions (e.g. FAST to other bank  cc transactions) then get 1% forincremental monthly average balance wrt previous month,btohqsg
hi  it looks like my GIRO payment from HSBC EGA to citi cc only paid the minimum sum. why is that so??,btohqsg
What did u tick in the giro form,btohqsg
How long it took for them to process ur giro?,btohqsg
i think less than 2 weeks i got an sms from HSBC  but abt a month before i got email from citibank,btohqsg
can‚Äôt rmb if i ticked full amount  maybe i made a mistake there. gonna call them see if can change else submit again..,btohqsg
I guess the only trick is to split the payments into 2 different dates  1st one charge to ur current card statement  then 2nd one charge to your next earliest cycle start date. Some merchant allow diff dates payments if its just a few days diff.,btohqsg
Hi there  could I ask what would this card be good for except for the initial 30k miles please? Or do you guys normally cancel it after one year.,btohqsg
Lounge access. I do plan to cancel after 1y if they dont waive AF.,btohqsg
Oh ok thank you as I seldom see any suggestions on using this card to clock miles or cashback here so far.,btohqsg
Hello Gurus! Can I ask if uob visa signature use with kris+  does it consider as contactless payment since it is by Apple Pay?,btohqsg
it has bad local earn rate  cannot use with card up  no promo earn rate (example dbs altitude year end promo 5mpd or uob prvi 5mpd fcy promo). Thats why no one talks about it.,btohqsg
My apologies Anthony. I am asking on behalf of a colleague. Could I ask how to apply for the 5mpd promo for dbs altitude and is it applicable to the altitude visa existing card holders please? I read above it is through the paylah app but I can't see it anywhere there. Thank you.,btohqsg
I can't see the promo myself but you try thishttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/228856,btohqsg
