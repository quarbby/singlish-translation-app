n my parents suspect is because the sch thinks i no evidence to back up that they verbally bullying me or something,btohqsg

you can ask florals to protect you,btohqsg

I think dropping econs is the riskiest and most not worth because H2 econs and H1 econs the content is similar and the test structure is different UNLESS the person’s csq is doing ok  struggling heavily with essay  but it is really not worth,btohqsg
Tbh 4H2 is kinda a safety net if u dunno which of the subj u gonna struggle w (then can drop to h1 later but actually may be wasted la to suffer for it). Some ppl (im not sure of its accuracy / how true) say 4h2 provided u do well will give higher chances of scholarships,btohqsg
It is not a default  it is uk ‘peer pressure’  everyone takes 4h2 coz the school encourages it and ofc those ppl hv strong acad calibre.,btohqsg
No it actually is the default in RI. Like they need to appeal to not take 4H2,btohqsg
‘Not everyone starts with 4H2 in RI. Because there will be those who opt for 3H2+1H1 from the start  by choice. And there will be those who go in with DSA who didnt meet the L1R5 of a certain score told to them by the school  who will start with 3H2+1H1  not by choice.’,btohqsg
For HCI  taking 4H2 is not a given for everyone. For IP students  you need to meet a certain GPA at Sec 4  to read 4H2s at JC1. I'm not sure what the criteria is for JAE students.,btohqsg
How does that prove it’s not  default. Those students who enter via JAE have told me that they actually have to *appeal* to take 3H2,btohqsg
u can’t run away from shit,btohqsg
just face it don’t bother changing class legit,btohqsg
Maybe that person was capping but she said that when she was considering taking 3H2  she was told that she had to appeal,btohqsg
But for ejc do they make ppl who want to take 3H2s appeal? If their o level score/GPA was good,btohqsg
Cos that was what someone from Rjc told me but then it could be that she was capping,btohqsg
Anyway in top tier JCs more than 80% of students would just take 4H2,btohqsg
I think best cheer has to go the roquila,btohqsg
has to be the most racist,btohqsg
im legit planning to js stay,btohqsg
anyways the 3 girls who bully me dont seem to be taking sch srsly so hope they lose by retaining lor,btohqsg
💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀,btohqsg
bro the sagitar cheer is js gun noises wtf,btohqsg
no point dropping to H1 nowadaysat most just ignore the subject first. Its score no longer matter,btohqsg
It could still waste more lesson time though,btohqsg
And also they forced to sit for more papers,btohqsg
I hope she had the teeth drill,btohqsg
it's like I go take 183 credits for NUS engineering instead of 161cuz I'm more for learning,btohqsg
learning doesn't matter as much as doing well,btohqsg
might as well drop and do better in a H1 rather than get a shit H2 grade and let it be a H1 grade,btohqsg
I mean if the students consider dropping one subject in the first place  chances are it’s because they don’t understand the subject well and won’t absorb much in class,btohqsg
They would rather devote their energies into the remaining 3 subjects to ensure they can do well for them,btohqsg
not wrong  it's like those nus students who chose modules based on which ones were easier to score than which one is more interesting for learning,btohqsg
I'm just more into really learning,btohqsg
i would take more mods for learning if my faculty let me take extra physics ones,btohqsg
so in the end i just audit,btohqsg
wth got one cyclist think pavement is theirs ah. Then keep ringing the bell and then i tried siaming but then she also keep cycling in the direction i siamed to and then keep ringing the bell then angry,btohqsg
i wld take interesting mods if NTU lets me SU them(and im sure letting me SU core mods will improve my mental physical and emotional well being...),btohqsg
I was honestly confused what she wanted me to do coz she rang the bell signalling her presence  i tried siam-ing and she cycled in the direction i siam-ed and keep ringing the bell,btohqsg
shld let them knock u down thn u claim insurance/s,btohqsg
Maybe if i was empty handed i would consider just walking my own way and ignore the bell,btohqsg
But i was carrying food and im hungry,btohqsg
walking pedestrians are the lowest of the low  can only afford shoes smh,btohqsg
I wondered what will she do if i just continued my way,btohqsg
Pretend i didnt hear the bell,btohqsg
Then jn she stopped at frowned at me,btohqsg
cuz u deaf cnnt hear the bell,btohqsg
I saw her cycling zig-zag and ringing the well💀i dunno what to do,btohqsg
then you'd graduate with a degree in CC mods,btohqsg
