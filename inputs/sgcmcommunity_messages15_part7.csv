Yo guys. For turbo car issit better to put a bov   close pod or open pod. Close pod is used mostly for turbo car n open pod for na car. Bov is supposed to store pressure and release Into the engine. Heard some ppl say using the bov messed up their air fuel ratio and sensor can't sense it properly.,btohqsg
if you running stock or not so aggresive stage 1  dont really need BOV,btohqsg
BOV is to release the pressure which prevents compressor surge. Compressor surge is when the air hits the closed throttle and goes back into the turbo which spoils stuff like the bearings,btohqsg
So probably I just get a CAI like hks,btohqsg
After rim n bbk will go for CAI and maybe intercooler,btohqsg
okay  just wanna lyk that CAI by itself is minimally effective to bring up the hp. CAI also decrease low end torque.,btohqsg
welcome to the zhng world where there is no end to zhnging🤭🤭,btohqsg
Yup so thinking issit close pod a better choice,btohqsg
Or a CAI needs a tune to bring the low end up,btohqsg
You can increase bhp by doing all these things?,btohqsg
simple stage 1 tune can bring up HP by alot already,btohqsg
I am just saying that CAI by itself is not really useful. It needs to be paired with a few other supporting mods to actually produce results 👍👍,btohqsg
Bmw g80 m3 wheel on Mazda 6?,btohqsg
