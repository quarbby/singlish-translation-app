Thrs q a few no meh,btohqsg
I‚Äôd say it becomes more ‚Äúeven‚Äù the higher you progress  psle is just rigged tbh,btohqsg
-more extracurricular programs (eg. Moot parliament program). Also more time to build extracurricular in Y4 due to no o levels-learn JC content in Y1-Y4 which kinda gives them a little headstart-(may vary) less spoonfeeding and more self directed earning (eg. for some math topics we watch lectures online first and then teacher goes through qn in class  which is how h2 math works in my school as all h2 math lectures are online)-have a group of friends when you enter jc  dont have to make friends all over again-more ecg programs (supposedly)-(anecdotal) ip kids adapt to jc faster than non ip kids,btohqsg
What did psle ever do to you man,btohqsg
it is never even the moment you are born,btohqsg
Only your first point is valid  the others are all meh. Even then if you‚Äôre committed you shd be able to find opportunities on your own  albeit it‚Äôs more difficult ofc,btohqsg
wish i had the brains at 12 lol,btohqsg
If it does help in some regard its alr a win or a benefit,btohqsg
fr  still waiting for it to happen to meüíÄ,btohqsg
Value-add to academics is insignificant or can be replaced easily via alternatives if you‚Äôre willing to go the extra mile,btohqsg
So u mean to tell me,btohqsg
That the average committed o level student,btohqsg
Would go read up on a levels stuff in their free time,btohqsg
"If they ban all tuition  then I will just tuition my own kids and make them score.Then it's going to be another ""It's not even"" argument in a different way",btohqsg
Why would you have to do that? üòÇ,btohqsg
Study during A levels for A levels bro,btohqsg
china did try to do smth liddat?,btohqsg
Cuz that's the benefit pointed out by matcha,btohqsg
Then u said that benefit is not a benefit,btohqsg
Cuz if ur committed u will do it,btohqsg
yes  and south korea did it years earlier.The same thing happened  underground black market tuition,btohqsg
If 2k insignifcant to u  can give me ? Is very significant to me,btohqsg
Idk I'm confused ur logic not rly logicking,btohqsg
Unrelated to wtv I‚Äôm saying lmao,btohqsg
Cuz in education there's not that fixed of a barrier,btohqsg
Wasnt meaning to attack you sorry,btohqsg
I'm actually curious why u think ip schs have completely no benefit,btohqsg
That you are also interested in kurt tay,btohqsg
I scrimped and saved the moment I graduated to almost hit that amt in monthly dividends.Spending on average $600 per month upon graduation and working 70+ hours a weekBut I still lose to those who got parents help to buy a condo right after graduation  and probably made a million extra by now,btohqsg
it will never be even or fair,btohqsg
I feel like ip schls benefit people differently it's just different people cope btr in different environments,btohqsg
I mean it does give you a head start but not like you‚Äôre being tested A level content at Os lol. Sure you can argue about the content overlaps but IP kids don‚Äôt even take Os lol??? üòÇ,btohqsg
Ya correct but u can't deny its not a benefit in the long run because for o level students who want to go JC  they would already have lost out abit because their IP peers are more familiar with the content,btohqsg
Ur saying that students who want to go jc from o levels would be naturally committed to studying jc content so this benefit is rendered null,btohqsg
To see if your claim is true  one way would be to group people going into secondary sch based on income brackets  then from lowest to highest  see what‚Äôs the percentage of people who end up in the IP track. If in general  the percentage  gets higher for each income bracket  then your claim is probably true.,btohqsg
But then u followed up by saying that students in o levels won't study jc content?,btohqsg
So im confused cuz u kinda contradicted urself abit,btohqsg
Like since we can‚Äôt rly define poor as it‚Äôs kind of arbitrary (not like we have absolute poverty in Singapore lol)  and we don‚Äôt know how the proportion of people in each income bracket,btohqsg
I would think that  if one takes the energy and time used for complaining about unfairness  and apply it to something useful  then others will complain that you got an advantage and it's unfair for them instead.,btohqsg
"yes ""Poor"" and ""rich"" is arbritary",btohqsg
Ngl I wonder what's the general consensus towards poor and rich,btohqsg
Why not just use deciles then.,btohqsg
But I know someone who thinks 5k/month is a high salary ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Ik poor people who go for tuition,btohqsg
Cuz they wanna use it to kinda like do btr in exams,btohqsg
Or they will go for those services that provide free tuition,btohqsg
Ok imoIt is if ur living aloneBut it isnt if you have a family to feed,btohqsg
My friend offers discounted gp tuition that had the same effectiveness and distinction rate as places like Indigo and even higher than some schs,btohqsg
And all his students are from bottom to mid tier JCs which makes it more impressive (most tuition services have a high distinction rate cuz they largely accept elite sch students - classicle for instance is mainly RI dominated),btohqsg
Content wise it can finished in 1.5 yrs which is what JC does. You won‚Äôt really be missing out much since IP kids likely won‚Äôt be doing TYS for As at y4 or smth lol  even if they did they won‚Äôt remember it aft 2 years. Again this is only a disadvantage if there‚Äôs a bell curve. If not you can still score decently by going to 2 year JC,btohqsg
