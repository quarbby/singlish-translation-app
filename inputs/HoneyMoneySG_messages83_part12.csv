1. Since you can refinance in March  your bank is proposing you put $200k for lower rates now? Is the lock in ending in March or that is the earliest you can refinance?2. 400k is a substantial amount but it is not that huge either  would you be open to put part of it into safer instruments and the remaining into higher risk ones? Bonds would be a good idea nevertheless  especially in a falling interest rate environment,btohqsg
Referring to the YouTube video from HoneyMoneySG on the best use of mileshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71s-Hass-yYI am a bit confused and seeking clarification.ADL to SIN costs $604 economy and $2768 on business. Miles is 30.5K and 68.5KSo including the $95 tax  that's(604-95)/30500= 0.016 cents per mile for Economy(2768-95)/68500= 0.039 cents per mile for BusinessDoes that mean that the business seat is more worth it because I am getting the value of almost 4 cents per mile?,btohqsg
Huh I have to spend $800 in SIA related then will entitle for 3mpd for my other eligible purchases such as Lazada / Shopee ah?,btohqsg
"For UOB KF card  ya  by *card year*So say your card expire in Apr  means Apr 2023 to Apr 2024  must have $800 SIA-group purchases (SIA  Scoot  KrisShop) then will count the ""shop online  etc. etc."" as 3mpd  to be credited 2 months after the card year)",btohqsg
Omg üò® on pt 1) it‚Äôs not eligible for $500 spend for this card (ok thanks  I really missed out this on my research üßê)On pt 2) even if I tag to Amaze  since UOb KrisFlyer CC is not under the list of eligible cards for UOB one account  I guess it will be useless to link to Amaze and buy my cat food and litter via Lazada right,btohqsg
2. Yes. End of day MCC is the deciding factor. But at least u will know what to use next time [ if wrong ],btohqsg
for Lazada and Shopee yes a bit pointless  Amaze is useful if you are doing retail shopping in malls then it can convert those like if shopping at LV or you go Watsons physical store then yes you link to amaze to convert to Online.,btohqsg
Ok let‚Äôs say I spend $5k and link with Amaze at LV store in Feb and by end of the calendar year then I manage to clock $800 min on SIA related group purchases  does my online purchases from LV and those previous months entitled for 3mpd ?,btohqsg
yes canThe Accelerated Miles will be awarded on these transactions for the entire membership year  not just from the time the minimum spend was met.https://milelion.com/2023/12/06/how-does-the-krisflyer-uob-credit-cards-accelerated-miles-feature-work/,btohqsg
Yes  redemptions for business class you will always get better value per mile than economy. But the actual value you get will come down to how much you would've been willing to pay in cash in the alternative (i.e. if you didn't have miles  would you have forked out $2.7k of your own cash to buy that business class flight? What is the max you would have been willing to pay in cash for that flight?),btohqsg
Bank haven't proposed yet.Most likely will split 400k up,btohqsg
The 200k idea is they propose one right,btohqsg
That's not correct  shopee and lazada practice dynamic mcc,btohqsg
1) Can shop around if you are prepared to refinance with others and whether your current income situation has changed compared to previous application.2) any thoughts about using maybe $200-$300k to offset the current mortgage to bring it lower?,btohqsg
meaning there is a range of mccs that could potentially appear  typically it is based on what you buy,btohqsg
Not sure worth bringing the loan amount lower. Will have to look at what is out there to invest,btohqsg
For 1. I assume you mean do a partial repayment of the mortgage? Or it's a different scheme. Right now bank will probably offer you around 3-3.5% mortgage rate  while you can probably get at least 3.5-4.5% investing in short-term/money market bonds externally. So from a pure reward standpoint I feel it doesn't make as much sense to do a repayment instead of investing. But of course if you value being debt-free earlier then by all means go for it.,btohqsg
Huh‚Ä¶ what does that mean? The MCC changes?,btohqsg
Ya thanks! Was thinking along this line,btohqsg
Lazada  shopee have a few mcc for different item purchase  even same item purchase from same merchant could have different mcc at time,btohqsg
Can we do top up from OA to MA? Tks,btohqsg
Is webull or moomoo fees cheaper for buying fractional share daily?,btohqsg
If I always buy from a specific seller in Lazada  can I ask the seller what‚Äôs their MCC code?,btohqsg
Hi if I am spending on Taobao with CRMC  does it counted as online spending?,btohqsg
"I suppose but most likely you would get a ""Hi friend  we are not sure  please contact Lazada for help""",btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt there‚Äôs an app for that? The property agents will be very interested to know their competition too üòÖ,btohqsg
or alternatively if you've bought in the past and really want to know the mcc  you can ask your bank,btohqsg
Ok ya.. that‚Äôs the other way to work around it. or maybe use amaze link to empty wallet to buy sth from the particular seller  and see their mcc code? ü§î,btohqsg
Sure but do keep in mind that there is still a small chance it might change  even if you buy the same product from the same seller,btohqsg
Dats why usually people recommend to use a card that gives reward for online instead of specific mccs  eg dbs womans world/ citi rewards/ citi smrt etc,btohqsg
I‚Äôm using the hsbc revolution for the cc sign up rewards only ie $500 spend. What do yall think I should do with the points after? üòÖ(Have other 4mpd cards so I doubt I will use this card after hitting the minimum spend),btohqsg
Will there be enough points to convert to miles with just $500 spend? üòÖ,btohqsg
They wont know  it is randomly assign by lazada,btohqsg
Thanks for the explanation. So I would be unlikely to fork out the $2.7K. Max $1 500 for it. So what would you suggest given this  buying economy outright or biz class saver redemption?,btohqsg
Min transfer 25k points (10k miles)  you need to spend 2500 at least,btohqsg
Waa is there any use for 5000 points üòÖüòÇ idk vouchers or smth?,btohqsg
Why not just spend 2500 and transfer the points out?,btohqsg
The other way is to convert to 2.5% cashback (to offset future bill)  min 4000 points,btohqsg
In that case you‚Äôre still getting about 2 cents per mile value which is not bad  and better than economy redemption. By all means go for it :)Another way to think about this is - at 2 cents per mile  if you earned them on a 4mpd card you effectively got around 8% cashback  which is a pretty great deal considering to the current cashback card landscape,btohqsg
There is miles conversion program for hsbc revo  $43+ 12 months unlimited conversion. But if you only convert one time  may be ex.,btohqsg
Have anyone NOT receive their posb cashback bonus which was suppose to be paid every 7th of the month?,btohqsg
So then I should just use the cashback option  $500 x 2.5% I‚Äôll get $12.50 cashback then next month I‚Äôll just spend $12.50 on this card and use the cashback to offset this spend? üòÉ does it work like this üòÇ,btohqsg
No you can‚Äôt offset the $500 spend cos the points only arrive in following calendar month after the spend.So is you spend $500  pay it off.Then spend $13 once you receive the points  offset using points. Pay off the remainder if any,btohqsg
So instead of $600 ticket on Economy  I am willing to pay 2 cents per mile for Biz Saver  which is good?What I still don't get (apologies for this) is that the actual cost of the ticket ($2768-$95)/68500= 0.039 cents per mile for Business  but my max willingness to pay is$1400 for the ticket (1400-95)/68500= 0.19 cents per mile.I'm having trouble comparing the $600 dollars economy to the 68 500 Biz saver miles.Thanks for your help.,btohqsg
Hi any guru can advise on this üôè,btohqsg
It's not an apples to apples comparison because you're trying to compare economy and business tickets. How you can look at it is:Scenario 1: Taking economy  is paying cash (means I've chosen cashback cards) or paying miles (means I've chosen miles cards) better?Scenario 2: Taking business  is paying cash or paying miles better?- In this scenario miles is clearly betterBut it's a purely personal choice on whether for any given flight  you want to take economy or business. That would depend on many things like flight length  which part of your trip it is  lounge options  travelling companions  etc.,btohqsg
Anyone has their funds successfully deducted from HSBC EGA to pay for DBS/posb credit card bill due today?,btohqsg
Yes  it is always ard 4 pm,btohqsg
Do you need to transfer in the funds to EGA like few days before?,btohqsg
Or just before 4 pm on due date will do,btohqsg
