lmao..nobody would care  i wouldn't care enough either to post much on it either,btohqsg

TM made it to next round cuz goal diff,btohqsg
they talk big but until i see any evidence of them enforcing anything,btohqsg
and the ppl who know wldnt talk about it either,btohqsg
according to a source i have  it probably affects ? they really know everything about youbut nothing is confirmed so dont believe me,btohqsg
btw i blocked the puzzle head guy,btohqsg
just that if you wanna apply for any govt stuff in the future try not to do anything thats illegal just to be safe,btohqsg
eh i feel like the current consequences wont hurt those that alr daring enough to vape,btohqsg
i mean sg has always used deterrence and not enforcement as a tool..just see speeding cars know alr  tp sit in their cars aim laser...sometimes aim also dont know aim where,btohqsg
dk what quota they gonna hit when they stand and shoot lasers are deserted roads,btohqsg
i think they are too addicted alr such that the demand is inelastic enough that any punishment cant stop them,btohqsg
1hr 1 car..might as well go aim laser everyday on ecp,btohqsg
"idk much about the job scope of the tp..but im very sure  their task to ensure ""safe driving"" means that their only actual quota hitting task is to catch speeders/reckless drivers..or people misusing vehicles",btohqsg
"if enforcement happens..it could be a game changer. but thats a big ""IF""",btohqsg

for spf its a non-seizable offence  its under HSA,btohqsg
i get that cause the only authority that can do anything that catches someone vaping is hsa,btohqsg
yea i do..but overall i think it has to come down to a problem of standization for enforcement..too many enforcement agencies that withold information from each otherwhether purposely or incidentally,btohqsg
i thought vapes are illegal in SG,btohqsg
theres also a lot of things illegal..but no enforcement  nobody knows,btohqsg
yea cause spf cant do anything,btohqsg
shld just go the route of ciggs and tax the living shit out of it,btohqsg
vapes are just like tonnes more toxic than normal cigarettes,btohqsg
then if spf is the one that issues the fines  what does hsa do..dont they issue fines as well,btohqsg
hsa/moh are the ones who can make the policies  spf is the one who can enforce,btohqsg
but the whole point of the police is to do enforcement what,btohqsg
then if they don't enforce certain things  maybe it's just an internal policy to close two eyes,btohqsg
