its more related to be exact lol,btohqsg
Donâ€™t pour alcohol into open fire,btohqsg
real life context: how to create a chemical warfare,btohqsg
did yall use mm or cm for x,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s also a way how to wash clothes,btohqsg
use micrometer screw gauge la yes,btohqsg
Enzymes are those substance to break into parts,btohqsg
i rmb there was like a qn i saw in sec 1,btohqsg
Itâ€™s something has to do with the breaking down of nutrients,btohqsg
then like they say got enzymes to remove the stain,btohqsg
dont yall learn enzymes in s1,btohqsg
I only know how to eat,btohqsg
How the hell did you remember this...,btohqsg
Does anyone know whether it's a curve or a straight line for physics practical planning,btohqsg
anyone here taking n lvls elect hist tmr? any idea what is gna come out,btohqsg
My cher say Stalin   Hitler and Korean War,btohqsg
But I know Itâ€™s not Cold War,btohqsg
This year donâ€™t have Asia Pacific,btohqsg
Surely one of the essay is about the source case study,btohqsg
you think ww1 will come out? it has been long since it did and only came out once,btohqsg
My essay is all about ah ma story,btohqsg
My dreams for distinction died with the practical,btohqsg
Apparently it's a curve for the sketch,btohqsg
I'm not sure I got a straight line too,btohqsg
What do you expect? Its 2020,btohqsg
Combined science physics practical was ok,btohqsg
chinese got water in the sea,btohqsg
physics now thereâ€™s stupid variations in gradient,btohqsg
I'm that person who wrote R2. ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
some of my friends got 1000+ for gradient,btohqsg
But I usually dont include physics in L1R5 so I think it shd be fine?,btohqsg
I feel like chemistry will be worse,btohqsg
My gradient is like 12.4 or something,btohqsg
Bruh some people forgot to use the 10 ohm resistor,btohqsg
idk i just used everything they gave,btohqsg
if there isnt the 10 ohm resistor wont it exceed the range?,btohqsg
Pretty sure that if you don't put the resistor then most readings will be out of range,btohqsg
I think m and cm is accepted  mm idk a bit weird for the later questions,btohqsg
I just heard it was a curve,btohqsg
This is for the planning right?,btohqsg
Cuz you sub W=0 into the equation then you get P=0 I thought,btohqsg
Yeah mine started from 0 but cos they say based on my results from the earlier part  then when I draw out my results it couldnâ€™t fit into a straight line,btohqsg
But I thought by the equation they give in an earlier part  it must be a straight line?,btohqsg
This year is like harder compared to past years,btohqsg
Isnt that true for all tests so far like mother tongue,btohqsg
Idk about the other mother tongues but Chinese written was harder but oral was ok (except I messed up),btohqsg
