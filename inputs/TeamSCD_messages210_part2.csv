Is ur fan running with aircon off?,btohqsg
Even water temp reach to a certain temp let say 90++ fan not running?,btohqsg
Yah apparently just now I was at idle my temp from 90 slowly increasing,btohqsg
Probably  ur thermostat or ur fan switch gone. Ur fan motor also might be gone. Thats why is not running even reach at certain temp.,btohqsg
Beforr cold start u check ur eo see low or not,btohqsg
If low  then probably ur engine eats ur oil,btohqsg
Base on what it i know that happen to me before,btohqsg
Hence u should get 2nd opinion before considering ah heng,btohqsg
