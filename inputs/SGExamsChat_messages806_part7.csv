Lmao? It's called the angmo tax,btohqsg
Funnily enough I just take the Full Japanese tours,btohqsg
Then remain confused as no matter what they say it's not like I will listen to em,btohqsg
NUS/NTU can get Japanese PR in just 1 year,btohqsg
Our mount fuji tour guide charge $700 for 6 of usðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Cos angmo have money. And they gladly pay 30 bucks for lousy ramen at home,btohqsg
There's a japanese show where singaporean tourists paid 100k jpy per pax for a seafood don,btohqsg
The chinese one we paid $70-85,btohqsg
And the japanese tv host was like these sinkies are rich,btohqsg
One factor is coz we do priv tour,btohqsg
Take the tour flag and then wave it around,btohqsg
Nah you get special (bad) treatment if you are prc tourist,btohqsg
But funny thing is one of the tour mostly English speaking so it became an english tour also,btohqsg
And wasted coz that day only 1st level was open due to slip precautions,btohqsg
Bruh u were better off burning your money ablaze instead of that,btohqsg
The japanese are doing just that with the plummeting yen,btohqsg
But omo got other attractions ard mount fuji,btohqsg
20 years ago it was the opposite; japanese tourists living it large in sg,btohqsg
Just that will be good to be at the 5th station one day,btohqsg
U see  japan is never enough for me,btohqsg
Uniqlo and many things are cheaper in japan coz of their currency,btohqsg
But just that the exchange rate to change back to SGD is q sucks,btohqsg
This takes the cake for weirdest checked luggage I've seen this year. Frozen croissants?,btohqsg
In fact  uniqlo pricing is still their old currency of 1SGD - 100Â¥,btohqsg
How does the croissants even survive?,btohqsg
Tbh i think it wun appreciate back any time soon,btohqsg
Which is why many japanese companies are reporting record profit on overseas sales due to exchange rate gains. They huat cos they report financials in jpy,btohqsg
Precisely  idk. I lol'ed when I saw it coming off the belt,btohqsg
At this rate i prolly will go japan every yr,btohqsg
Don't forget to verify your student status with sq for those economy class discounts,btohqsg
For japan flights can be more than 50% off,btohqsg
Sadly i did not know of such discounts,btohqsg
And sometimes one way is cheaper than round trip if you are on student discount,btohqsg
But i will definitely be back on ANA / SQ soon,btohqsg
At least you are going to be making big bucks at your freshgrad job soon,btohqsg
NUS 8th best university in the world graduate,btohqsg
And my parents recently wanna safe money so hvnt been on sq since 2022 trip,btohqsg
And also coz my fam is big lah,btohqsg
Damn even psc scholar need to save money by foregoing trips?,btohqsg
But good thing is some companies pay for SQ business class,btohqsg
But thing is i dun think i will be in roles w overseas biz trip,btohqsg
If i tell this to my mum  she will be this is the stupidest thing in job considerationðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Oh dam SQ seems to be cheaper then jetstar,btohqsg
SQ is often cheaper than budget  depending on the date.,btohqsg
Actually might not be once u have a family,btohqsg
Does sq have limit for carry on?,btohqsg
If you can travel and enjoy good compensation  why not? A lot of roles with travel come with great compensation too.,btohqsg
1*7kg in economy  2*7kg in business/first,btohqsg
Though I haven't been checked since covid... I've gotten away with way more than 7kg in economy.,btohqsg
But no seperate charge for carry on add on like jetstar?,btohqsg
