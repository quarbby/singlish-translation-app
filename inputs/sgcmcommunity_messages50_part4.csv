fuel oil comes from crude oil field which riggers need to hit rock bottom to extract. our fuel oil mainly comes from middle east or south america (i heard the oil well had dried up so not sure if there are any new explorations.) as for natural gas  as far i can remember  australia has a plant called wheat stone and providing it for oceania region. As to the million dollar question if fuel oil prices will go up  i said it will be cos when one tips the scale  everything lost balance,btohqsg
But why is it going down now,btohqsg
Maybe cuz Esso spoil the market. They lowered their price then the whole petrol village have to follow,btohqsg

Price will just keep go up with more ev on the road,btohqsg
Actually I think the petrol price increase is marginal. Comparing to car mods  grooming  tints  exhaust upgrades  etc... Yes some of these you can say is one time cost but most of these mods actually make the fc worse so why do it in the first place if petrol price is a concern? Nothing much can do about the price increase  a better will be to focus on making more money or if that's not possible  then consider taking public transport. Petrol is one  there are more concerned stuff like food prices  electricity  etc. Car is a nice to have not a must have.Don't flame me and my0.000002 cents,btohqsg
