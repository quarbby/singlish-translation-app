Nothing racist. It's the reputation of companies' home country's regulatory system. It's hard facts.,btohqsg
U obviously haven’t observed how China companies treat investors when they run into trouble……,btohqsg
Hi All  hope anyone can help me out. I have Citi Rewards  Hsbc Revo  POSB everyday cards. Which of these cards is best to use for fuel? Thanks in advance. 😊,btohqsg
If the country enforced better regulations  could have stopped them from doing these bullshit 🤪,btohqsg
China government protects own people. Overseas investors bear the bulk of losses.,btohqsg
Protect their own rich people* 🤣,btohqsg
You certainly don't see enough. US also have similar issue around too. Bastards is everywhere I will say. So I won't racism any country just by individual incident.,btohqsg
Does the self transfer to UOB One via UOB SALA  still work?,btohqsg

Your words not specific enough tho. You are not ineligible. You can still register 150k  on top of the 150k you withdrawn on 1 Jun.,btohqsg
Is it racism if its against my own race?,btohqsg
ok wow  thanks for that. shall explicitly ask about it in the call,btohqsg
Hello Shifus Does anyone know whats up with this OCBC 365 “Recurring bills promo” on their website? -https://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/cards/tncs-governing-the-ocbc-365-cc-recurring-billings-promo.pdfI don’t get it  is it additional 3% cashback on top of the original 365 cashback or is it the TnC of how to get cashback on recurring bill payments on 365 originally (as part of card benefits)? Thanks in advance if anyone can shed some lightIf it is the latter  this is absurd LOL - you must make (1) 1 new bill payment + (2) 1 recurring payment AND if same billing organisation you pay multiple bills  only count as 1 bill available for cashback. So my fam household all different line on MVNO tagged to diff people so the bills are separate. How is this then a freaking promo when it should be an original entitlement of 3% cashback as per card original TnC?Wth man OCBC is retarded with this pua stunt. Does any other banks do the same as well?,btohqsg

"Can I say there is one more consideration that HSBC EGA is more liquid than UOB one + saver promo?HSBC EGA will count the increment of ADB vs the reference month. So if I put the money into HSBC EGA  I can withdraw it anytime and I will still get 4.6% of my ADB that months.But for UOB one + saver promo. my money is kind of ""stuck"" there if I want to have the highest EIR of approx 5.6% pa.Do I understand this correctly?",btohqsg

HI guys  what CC should I use for flight ticket and hotel booking for a holiday?,btohqsg
any gurus here got study how maximise earning healthpoints to redemn ntuc vouchers from healthy 365 app?pls share tips,btohqsg
Wow.. now I’m worried about mine. Have almost 7 weeks lead time before cc due date.,btohqsg
They also screwed up my first form submission lol,btohqsg
Today I’m supposed to get my moomoo 6.8% cash coupon  does anyone know usually what time it should appear ?,btohqsg
I think the 30 days withdrawal thingy is to determine the balance for our reference month.I mean if you put the money for  example  20 days  and withdraw it for whatever reason  the average daily balance of that 20 days will still earn 4.60% interest. While for UOB the money is locked if we want to have the EIR of 5.60%.,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/214559Uncharted waters on how Uob and HSBC will deal with the tnc.Scb has been there all along and not strictly enforced.,btohqsg
I want to check with you experts on the 30 days withdrawal for hsbc Ega. Say for example the average daily balance of the reference month is $10k...then today I put in $20k from another bank and I withdraw $15k on the same day and tomorrow I put in $30k,btohqsg
So what is my fresh funds under hsbc lingo?,btohqsg
Strictly speaking:$20 - 15 + 30 = $35k fresh funds.,btohqsg
May i ask.. when we already have a giro set up with a bank (eg. ocbc) after i apply giro with another bank  what will happen?Will it get rejected? If its accepted  do i need to manually terminate my previous GIRO set up  or its auto?,btohqsg
It will replace the old giro. Just keep old giro in place until new one is in place,btohqsg
How come the UOB interest is lesser than last month while the average balance increases?,btohqsg
Are there any money changer in singapore who accepts grabpay??,btohqsg
For HSBC EGA's July & Aug promo  if deposit 100K  the earned bonus interest will only be credited on 31 October (assuming fulfilling $2k deposited & 5 transactions done). So between 1 Sept - 30th Oct  we are required to maintain the 100K in the account? Otherwise wont qualify to get the earned interest bonus?,btohqsg
For HSBC  how to check that we already fulfil the 5 transactions ?,btohqsg
If need less than S$400 in cash  can opt for YouTrip for withdrawal at overseas ATM,btohqsg
They will send sms to confirm you are eligible. Not instant though.,btohqsg
Just do both criterias one shot on the first day then no need to worry Liao.,btohqsg
It is ok.. mine is > 400. I will just draw cash to exchange,btohqsg
