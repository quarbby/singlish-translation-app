Gg someone in my class tried to lift up chair,btohqsg
Den quite funny see people diam the cookhouse go salute him,btohqsg
the chair back panel came out,btohqsg
Mine 04/21 change to denise oh,btohqsg
But the sch sm was the botak guy,btohqsg
other times was the arm rest came out,btohqsg
I heard after i post out,btohqsg
He ask one sgt to follow him around,btohqsg
Coz his back got issue cannot stand long,btohqsg
Den the sgt hold chair for him to let him seat,btohqsg
He asked us on first day if we think wear helmet make us dumb anot,btohqsg
Tf am i supposed to say,btohqsg
He ran w the co in the morning once  ran pass us during morning pt  stop and ask one of my coy dude why he nvr diam the company and greet him,btohqsg
I rmb my oc low key flex on me once,btohqsg
During soc coz i fall out  den i was task to flatten the sand for high ropes,btohqsg
Den my oc just walk and climb the ropes only with his hands,btohqsg
Den he say train more u also can do it,btohqsg
i might be TAing engineering people for math this sem,btohqsg
Isnt the same for physics students,btohqsg
Depends which type of engineering u taking tho no meh,btohqsg
Usually aero is like naturally smart,btohqsg
itâ€™s a common math mod so itâ€™s shared across multiple engineering,btohqsg
idk what mix of people iâ€™ll get,btohqsg
As a ta u just produce the slides and teach ah,btohqsg
U can make more gen z jokes inside ur slides i guess,btohqsg
sometimes mainly in charge of tutorials,btohqsg
What my maths prof did that time was that she relate alot to us in-terms on uni life n stuff,btohqsg
Yaa just make them laugh can rdy,btohqsg
ohh. lol only if i never take ahead then maybe i get u as ta ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
cause i got a for h2 math so i skipped math 1 and took math 2 in sem 1 lol,btohqsg
they extend TA for that to physics people bc i think they couldnâ€™t find enough from engineering side,btohqsg
yeah i think next sem probably like 1k ppl taking math 2 lol,btohqsg
bruh the dude need more practice lol,btohqsg
wanna see if i can TA the physics mod,btohqsg
He draw blood halfway the swab and the needle both drop,btohqsg
End up he left me there with blood everywhere :/,btohqsg
i always hear their quiz average is 20+/55lol,btohqsg
itâ€™s like the most commonly posted about mod on the ntu reddit lol,btohqsg
yeah. even some guy ik from india claim he know everything from high school physics alr but in the end he still only get 35/55 for quiz 1,btohqsg
(i skipped it cause a for h2 phy),btohqsg
idk how dr leek teaches for ph1011 but ph1012 is taught by probs one of the best profs out there in terms of purely teaching,btohqsg
even ppl getting 28/55 alr regarded as masters of phy ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
so poly people kinda benefit there,btohqsg
my J2 time everyone was like congratulating this guy for Phy mid year paper cuz he scored ~80+ marks (the tutor said it one week before giving out the papers)I was there keeping quiet about my 91 marks minus 1 for sf. ðŸ™Š,btohqsg
ngl ph1011 and ph1012 does a good job of slapping you in the face if you sorta know h2 stuff but donâ€™t understand well,btohqsg
esp bc i know how they set papers,btohqsg
it was an easy paper for motivation btw. Whole cohort everyone score went up  so not a good comparison,btohqsg
That's my last year batch for wa3,btohqsg
Apparently WA3 practical was easy to score,btohqsg
And alot of ppl got either full marks or A for it,btohqsg
