boeing has been a lil messed up for awhile,btohqsg
company infrastructure and management problems due to internal conflicts relating to workplace drama ( including and not excluding-- insubordination  power struggles  backstabbing  petty arguing  misunderstandings  complaining  issues with managing emotional in and out of different times  gossiping  ostracizing aka cliques etc,btohqsg
a lot of companies  not just boeing have issues slowly brought back to the public's eye or the attention of the crowd,btohqsg
I hate how SQ is forced to keep these old planes because Boeing is dragging their asses with the 777X,btohqsg
at the same time I think good to not put all your eggs in one basket bah,btohqsg
as much as idl boeing and their bs,btohqsg
btr to have half a fleet of planes than to have nothing when one plane goes bonk,btohqsg
i mean i do like the max but idg why wasnt A321neo a option fot SQ,btohqsg
ya same I wldve much preferred going w the A320 neo family  considering Scoot already has A320s,btohqsg
I rly dun get why they went for the max,btohqsg
like you have the A321LR and A321XLR variant,btohqsg
I shall continue flying my A320neo on msfs and pretend that sq has them,btohqsg
and 787-10 for regionals is just...,btohqsg
I mean I guess I get 787s  it's like in between A350s and A320/B737 in terms of capacity  but with the range of (p much) an a350,btohqsg
but I think partially it's also due to being able to expand fleet faster ig,btohqsg
queueing for the a350 vs getting both a350+787 at the same time,btohqsg
It generally flies to SFO from Changi  plus the Dreamliners have a nice ride,btohqsg
Guys any last minute tips on chrysalids,btohqsg
There is this course at RP which has 26 cut-off point and lets say i have 20 points but i dont have the relevant subjects can i still appeal for dae or is it a waste of time?,btohqsg
what school is it? cause 26 sounds like its school of infocomn,btohqsg
Actly im curious wats the starting time like for those studying in poly,btohqsg
shouldn't it be based on the lecturer's schedule?,btohqsg
depends whether your lecturer works in multiple colleges/university?Or is it those industrial lecturers  who only can come work after 5pm?,btohqsg
that's for the case in malaysia lah. singkie. not sure this thing is common.,btohqsg
specifically for rp tho its 8:30-9:45 starting time dependent on yr you are from,btohqsg
if the cut off point is more than your estimated aggregate points with ELMAB3 or L1R4  you can still try to appeal even if you don't meet the MER (minimum entry requirements) for relevant subjects needed for the course you're looking at,btohqsg
ngl i don't think poly  ite  uni timetables in class is as straightforward as pri  sec sch & jc,btohqsg
but should be relatively easy to remember with a copy of the schedules you have,btohqsg
uni isn't even on the same level as far as scheduling goes,btohqsg
especially since it's usually repetitive order time,btohqsg
sometimes  there will also be last minute changes to the start of certain modular lessons or lecture timings,btohqsg
which won't always be known to students,btohqsg
rp is starting to do that now  doing last minute shcedule shift with no announcements until the very day itself..,btohqsg
to get my final diploma  i just have two ESE's for two mods  thats it,btohqsg
the other 2 are pass/fail mods where both have 70% of lessons are home based,btohqsg
rp is really changing up how they run their classes,btohqsg
at least you're near the end,btohqsg
the two mods legit go and waste time,btohqsg
one is safety management...literally listening to safety breifings every lesson for 1hr+,btohqsg
My classes tend to be scheduled all over the place in uni,btohqsg
I have a strict rule in uni  any class that starts before 12pm does not exist to me,btohqsg
then my body will be there but my soul wouldnt,btohqsg
My 8am to 12pm Organic Chem Lab begs to differü§ß,btohqsg
I fully agree with this though,btohqsg
