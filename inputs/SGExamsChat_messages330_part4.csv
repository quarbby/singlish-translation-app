Then somehow the plot I guessed it so wrong,btohqsg
Google Translate is the mother of amazing translations.,btohqsg
ok so basically the plot was suppose to be a guy love a gurl then the gurl Kena pregnant the guy left her overseas cause of the mother then the gurl come find him then the mother angry and slap slap the guy then throw money on the gurl,btohqsg
I thought it was the guy cheat on the wife then the gurl the mistress,btohqsg
Then throw money is to ask her get rid of the baby,btohqsg
