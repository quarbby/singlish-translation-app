"""Our fair value does not include the value of Avarga‚Äôs two other businesses (paper manufacturing and power plant in Myanmar)  and hence we believe that our valuation is on the conservative side.""-- KGI report",btohqsg
ALSET reverse = Tesla  I got no money to buy Tesla so bought some ALSET @0.062 üòÇ,btohqsg
Meanings AVARGA target price maybe 50-60cents level,btohqsg
We do not have an official rating but estimate a fair value of S$0.43 based on 10x FY2020F P/E.Earnings this year will largely be driven by Taiga‚Äôs 2H20 performance.Potential further upside if it is able to monetise its two other businesses in Asia  which we have not included in our fair value estimates.,btohqsg
