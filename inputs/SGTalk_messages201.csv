True. Many would wan to forget the ordeal n move on. It leaves a scar deep inside. Very difficult to open up. Me n my wife have taken care of kids who were sexually molested by the biological father. Took a very long time for them to forget and move on. They won't even mention or talk about it.,btohqsg
Not really trained. We attend courses abt these domestic issues. Me n my wife are Volunteers for MSF taking care of abused kids in our own home. Been doing this for close to 20 years.,btohqsg

I see the purple I tot is a 🍆,btohqsg
i just sent to grooming 1 week ago,btohqsg
west side weather very shiok now,btohqsg
I see already i angry  this owner bring dog out never leash properly. she better don't own a dog next time  poor dog,btohqsg
quite sad for someone who dont want to recognise their own race.,btohqsg
My senior reported him for me de,btohqsg
idk maybe bc for Indians knowing that they’re the minorities here  they might wanna use a race that’s not being look down upon for example white people and blend it tgt w their own so others won’t look down at them in a way,btohqsg
if u get what I’m tryna say,btohqsg
and they might think if they do recognise their own race  others will avoid and stereotype them or smt,btohqsg
I don’t think it’s fair to say that,btohqsg
should have closed the windows instead 😂,btohqsg
Eurasian just meansEuropean + AsianAng Moh + Indian = Eurasian mah,btohqsg
Nehhh if the dog is running like that it’s fine,btohqsg
I didn’t see the dog being ran over leh,btohqsg
oh my fawking Jesus Christ sake,btohqsg
I’ll literally hunt down this guy and send him to hell myself lol,btohqsg
"I read the long ass self entitled commentary and i have zero sympathy for the dog owner.i only have pity for the dog. the owner is the typical ""everyone else is wrong except me"" kind of person",btohqsg
I read tooI kinda feel the owner definitely has a part to play that this tragedy happenedBut sometimes dog also naughty Jump out of car,btohqsg
Dog owner literally think that their dog won't run out to the road. So owner is partly to blame.,btohqsg
Probably the car that run over the dog can't even notice the dog.,btohqsg
not for me to point fingers but the post insinuated a lot of things about the other car driver which was uncalled for,btohqsg
Don't blame the other car or dog. Blame the owner.,btohqsg
Also very unexpected so see a dog run out,btohqsg
I mean u see the car It wasn’t speeding,btohqsg
If he saw sure can stopLikely thought is a cupboard box or what,btohqsg
you see you will slow down meh,btohqsg
because this whole incident thing could have been avoided only if the owners themselves closed the windows,btohqsg
I can't even notice the hazard light.,btohqsg
The owner know and is chasing the dog,btohqsg
The owner is to blame.  End of the story.,btohqsg
U don't like that... Later her sob story don't work,btohqsg
Let her sob. Serve her right.🤣,btohqsg
Not fit to be dog owner.,btohqsg
She shld have said Johnny Depp beat her...,btohqsg
I sometimes even see dog owner carrying the dog while driving. These people don't fit to be dogs owner.,btohqsg
Well they themselves should know as pet owners that dogs and cats have the tendency of jumping out of the car out of naughtiness,btohqsg
The car is not even speeding.😂,btohqsg
well if the windows aren’t up then it’s ok,btohqsg
The owner could just be grieving for the death of her dog and write in such a spiteful way,btohqsg
heng not motorbike.. later DPS skid over and crash how?,btohqsg
that’s true but still  I wouldn’t fully blame the car that ran over the dog,btohqsg
Very hard to blame the driver,btohqsg
That road is slightly curved. So as u drive and come up to the top of the “curve” very hard to spot something as short as a dog,btohqsg
next time own a dog need license  only responsible people can own dogs,btohqsg
And u sure pick up speed because u need more rev to go up the curve,btohqsg
No one will purposely run a dog over in that situation. Why the dog running loose in the first place,btohqsg
As u approach the peak as the road going downhill,btohqsg
just read this....obviously this person trying stir shit,btohqsg
are you saying the car sped up?,btohqsg
In theory but nobody drives like this,btohqsg
are you saying if he's driving a subaru XV he definitey would have seen the dog?,btohqsg
Because nobody expects a fucking animal to appear in the middle of the road,btohqsg
do you know whats the teaching for what to do when an animal appear in front of your car out of no where?,btohqsg
U tell me u drive who when reach the end of the trajectory of a winding road will slow down? Nobody,btohqsg
Coffee. Because in a bad boy,btohqsg
and you know how the subaru xv hit the dog? you know how it sound like to the subaru driver?,btohqsg
just no swerving no e brake,btohqsg
That’s why more probablyDidn’t see dogDidn’t know bang dog,btohqsg
subaru xv tall. sure can see. not i say one,btohqsg
Tbh. Bartley there that junction alot stray furs.,btohqsg
Midnight u see alot gathering in the middle of the road,btohqsg
wahhh how you see its fur,btohqsg
Fur refer cats and dogs. Haha,btohqsg
How to define if driver knowing that they had hit on them ?,btohqsg
If I'm driving a truck  and just nice. I drove past and they appear just my front wheel hit on them ?,btohqsg
ya.. just say deny can liao,btohqsg
That road too dangerous to stop also,btohqsg
Unless the driver also has a death wish,btohqsg
Yah lo. During the daylight  all heavy vehicles transporting sands and materials past there,btohqsg
True la. This incident is the driver at fault  I would said. But if he/ she really no see. Then where would the eye on ? Phone ? .,btohqsg
dont like that... later she no one to blame liao  she wld blame LTA for building that road,btohqsg
Haha. Yah... commuters shld read and warn self person to be more cautions on road and not to comment so much .. machiam is involved.,btohqsg
Yah. Not that the fur kids know how to behave itself by sitting guai guai in the car.,btohqsg
Car 1 stops.  Dog turns to go on the other lane.Then car 2 driving  an animal appears from a blind spot infront of car 1,btohqsg
Split second decision what do anyone do?,btohqsg
In such sudden situations. But I think the car 2 should stop and like see what's up.,btohqsg
Or maybe he don't even know he ran over a dog.,btohqsg
Duno if car 1 even lights up hazard light anot. Haha.,btohqsg
another Amber Heard  everyone wrong except herself,btohqsg
fine the dog owner  costs a dog's life.,btohqsg
She write until so jialat. Sure dog die sad.,btohqsg
write more jialat can win more sympathy votes mah. Just like Amber Heard. Cost JD of his movie roles.,btohqsg
I think it's just a series of unfortunate events,btohqsg
First of all  dog ran from the house. Why? Gate no close? How it it get out? Negligence on their part? Or dog escape?,btohqsg
Then comes the epic car chase for 40 mins and by foot(less helicopter),btohqsg
ya use car chase a dog. what get-away vehicle did the dog used?,btohqsg
So many points in this whole ordeal that at anytime could go wrong,btohqsg
Maybe they left the gate open forgot close dog run out. No one know  just nice car ran it over... blame the driver,btohqsg
If me I'd say 飞虎队 about to rapel down from here liao,btohqsg
Run out from houseCan chase ur dog to the viaductThey also li hai lah hor,btohqsg
