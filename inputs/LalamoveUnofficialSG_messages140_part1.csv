Don't need sign up for the v day project 1 lah. If no1 sign up  they will throw out the job in the app. Them just don't take first. If no1 take then as the date gets nearer they will +++. Earn much more lor then if u take the job under the project. Every yr v day also like that.,btohqsg

Before this order is picked up ppl,btohqsg

Heavy rain fee like üí© sleep better ü§£,btohqsg
OA  SA and MA all will have contribution based on your age group.,btohqsg
Depends on whether you got opt in or not for the cpf scheme,btohqsg
Just wondering if anyone talk about this before   if we not working we should go ‚Äúoffline‚Äù if we ‚Äúon duty‚Äù but not working the fees ‚Äúgenerated‚Äù will consider the number of people ‚Äúon duty‚Äù hence if many ‚Äúon duty‚Äù the fees will be cbai ammt because many people even not working also on the app.,btohqsg
Any logic to this ? I agakration only lah,btohqsg
The fees not determined by that,btohqsg
Fees determine by customers of this charitable organization,btohqsg
I suggest base price starts from 0. Let the price be like auction. Believe there are some who are willing to deliver even at $2,btohqsg
The medisave fees also like buay zhun,btohqsg
I did 30+ orders roughly 30-$40 medisave,btohqsg
I only get $11 for janüòÇ,btohqsg
Troublesome though have to count the amt deducted for each job for cpf üòÖ,btohqsg
Of course so many other factors lah   distance mainly the factor   end of day demand supply also play a part   if all ‚Äúon duty‚Äù the charges for high demand low   if less people working high demand certain areas then the fees high .. this my logic lah,btohqsg
Mine never Opt in goes to MA,btohqsg
Same issue. I have emailed them. My guess is less than 500 monthly sal  no need for employee contribution,btohqsg
If no opt in then won't get employee contribution mah,btohqsg
All will go medisave if no opt in,btohqsg
Can refer to the earnings slip as refence to see whether tally if we count manually.,btohqsg
I thought you‚Äôd be the first few to realise. üòÖ,btohqsg
