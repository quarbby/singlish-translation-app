They will let you know when it's near ur ballot number. If pple in front of your number have to change appointment n delay their unit selection  u will also get delayed.,btohqsg
Apply under full time student n make sure ur have enough to pay for 5Ÿ™ downpayment n all the extra fees (either from cpf and/or cash). Don't worry too much  if u got a queue number  during your unit selection  they will help you with all the procedures and etc. Even if u missed out some documents during the appointment  they will give some time to upload them on9 as long as you don't missed the importants one like your NRIC üòÖ,btohqsg
Next will be September 2022. Just be alert of the upcoming news of online application coming soon.,btohqsg
Ammendment..... Sales of Balance Flats in November 2022. Open Booking of Flats in September 2022.,btohqsg
Thank you!May I know if I'm able to get the bto I applied  am I still eligible to go sales or balance flat or open booking flat if I'm deem the and is a better choice?,btohqsg
How to interpret the application rate? Anyone knows?,btohqsg
You can still apply  doesn‚Äôt quite affect anything,btohqsg
Any buyer group for Jurong West Jewel,btohqsg
U may see under HDB websites for the eligible schemes. Whichever u applied  if u managed to secure a queue number plus a unit for yrself  u have to cancel the application that u didn't manage to get. Example if u apply both under bto and open booking/sales of balance flats and managed to secure a unit under either one of the application  u need to cancel the other. Mostly units are first come first serve basis despite the ones u choosen. Good lucküòÅ.,btohqsg
Sometimes it all depends on luck too ‚úåÔ∏è,btohqsg
hello can anyone enlighten me with regards to the ‚Äòadditional subsidy‚Äô for past PLH models like exactly how much did HDB give,btohqsg
I just put in $10 for CCK,btohqsg
If you get high queue number  will you choose a unit there?,btohqsg
You need to see how many applicants give up the flat in front of you.,btohqsg
Yes sia I need a flat. Actually I do not know much like how to see the area  but seems like a shorter waiting time to get the flat. What you think? A good plot of location?,btohqsg
if you need a flat urgently  but dont care much for location  can standby for NOV sale of balance flat.. very likely to have open flats at like Tengah,btohqsg
Has plenty of food choices  teck whye market  schools  bus stops  lrt  2 stops to cck mrt which has a mall and bus interchange. straight bus 190 to orchard,btohqsg
But I used to work at punggol area the LRT is always on maintainence I wondering if CCK will be similar. Always I'm late one. Due to the LRT,btohqsg
If don‚Äôt want take lrt  you got a handful of busses to take to go cck,btohqsg
Did you ballot for any Aug 2022?,btohqsg
Similar to BTO imo  due to low number of units. Benefit would be shorter wait,btohqsg
Hi  Any telegram group for forest spring @ yishun?,btohqsg

when can we expect the launch of open booking?,btohqsg
Only news on hdb site is that it'll be out sometime in Sep  maybe you can sign up for the eAlert to get updates,btohqsg
Last day of the month.  HDB always last day of everything,btohqsg
Don't pin your hope so high,btohqsg
May I if open booking units are significantly cheaper? Since there are lesser grants,btohqsg
Hi  just want to know if we get a number for BTO  how early from the result will they call you for an appointment? Assuming you get the best numbers.,btohqsg
Depends on the project  the selection start dates are staggered for each launch (as in for one launch  diff projects will have diff selection start month),btohqsg
Best or lousy number is same results date,btohqsg
I think Iqbal is asking for selection appt not when we get the results of the ballot,btohqsg
Oh then depending on HDB .,btohqsg
Some will be 5rm flat first some 2rm first,btohqsg
1st time BTO  two times SBF failed. Lol,btohqsg
Is okay . Many apply 11 times also can't get,btohqsg
Yeah  and as a Singles Scheme  perhaps more tough,btohqsg
Not perhaps already  indeed tougher. Hahaha,btohqsg
Wow! So many times! All the best,btohqsg
I gotten a number for May BTO within supply3rd time BTO,btohqsg
Yes  like playing Singapore Pools already  hahaha,btohqsg
@DaemonChyldefor Aug 2022 launch selection period will be Nov 2022-Aug 2023 (see source below)  but this period is across all projects in the launch  so not necessarily that your project will start Nov 2022. From my experience of May 2022  they stated that selection starts from Jul 2022 but i know Toa Payoh and Bukit Merah only started in Aug 2022  Lakeside started in Jul.Plus there'll be GRO and MGPS queue first  so the first public queue will be after those.Source:https://blog.seedly.sg/hdb-bto-august-2022-launch/,btohqsg
