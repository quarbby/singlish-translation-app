Firstly are they really telling the truth  we will never know. did they meet the criteria  implementation is by strict criteria.Not stating which criteria they fail that leads them to not receiving more benefits. They may have more than one property  Their household income maybe more than the criteria. Some even resign on their own  that is their own fault. It is not I don't care.From forum:This is my rejected sms(MSF): (date and time of application xxxx)Support Grant application was unsuccessful as you did not meet one or more of the eligibility criteria.How to appeal like this? I only have one screenshot email and one whatsapp that my performance not up to standard. After that I was asked to resign  Everyday got scolded until can’t take it.

They’ll probably tell u some information that can easily be googled  and try to upsell u a more expensive course towards the end of the lesson,btohqsg
Ever been to one of those free talks just to see what’s actually happening. Surprised that some people actually believe them and put up $500++ for such a course,btohqsg
Or perhaps they are part of the same team  and they act like they are buying into the course so more people would folloe suit,btohqsg

I’ll disagree with this. Courses are not magical get-rich-quick but the information and schedule helps a lot. I spent $2k on a course and I started a small biz which got incorporated after 1 year and revenue is now $2m in my 3rd yearThe course fee is well worth it,btohqsg
Perhaps who the speaker is also matters. The course i attended was from syakir hussein  when i googled him  it seemed really sketchy,btohqsg
$500 is damn cheap. What’s $500 when u can do so much afterwards. Not only did I spent $2.8k on online courses and started my biz  I sponsored my bro abt $6k worth of courses....His biz is now doing $5m last quarter,btohqsg
But then again  to find a good speaker is really hard,btohqsg
No matter how good a person is  sure got haters ba.I won’t reveal who I learnt from (I spent both on local and American courses) but I know for sure got plenty of bad reviews on them,btohqsg
Nowadays even my friends ask me to teach them  I’ll share basic but told them if they want to be serious just pay for a proper one and get started.They asked me are the courses good  I’ll just show them my amazon or qoo10 screenshot,btohqsg
Doesn’t matter which guru as Long as u joined and take action after learning.Course is easy to learn but taking action afterward is hard,btohqsg
Agreed  If people don't put in effort in learning  and have a mindset   keep complaining  this lecturer no good  waste time and money. No matter how good the course  it is useless.,btohqsg

He is Singapore 🇸🇬 defence minister lei.... need to lie about having Muslim sailors???,btohqsg
Defence Minister: There is no Muslim officer in Navy because I cannot please all requests,btohqsg

@skyprince08Ive no idea haunted or not but I'm curious why do u ask?,btohqsg
Anyone know where to buy affordable luggage?,btohqsg
For a strange reason  Value stores do sells luggages. Perhaps selected outlets. Idk. Price wise probably as budget as it can probably gets. If not Bugis street market  for not the brand conscious. 👌,btohqsg
Anyone got called up for mob manning during this period?,btohqsg
Jotun  sell white paint to PAP  huat ah,btohqsg
Huat ah! Sell banner and flower garlands!!!,btohqsg
Sometimes I think it might be better for the council of presidential advisors to advise the president on the dissolution of parliament rather than PM? Even though PM is head of state but a little conflict of interest since is in a political party?,btohqsg
Wonder what is the point of voting then? Hmm...,btohqsg
Council of presidential advisors should not have political party affiliation,btohqsg
And they can see from the point of view of the current economic  health  security climate the appropriate timing to call for elections.,btohqsg
They can only trace the polling stations,btohqsg
One polling station has about 2k+ voters,btohqsg
Each polling station  you can only trace the for and against votes,btohqsg
Nope  you can trace individual   rememeber each card have your particulars and a serial no. It to see what u have voted,btohqsg
They wanna see who vote for who and remember why there is Punggol East and etc   they will merge if the vote is against them   and spilt if they vote they have high vote,btohqsg
Listen to a Liar  Good luck.,btohqsg
Now I know why so many people got trick in scam  so many liars and naïve people.,btohqsg
No. It goes against the rules of election.,btohqsg
When u register at counter  show ic and they search for your name. Your name has an index number and they will issue that vote from the list... so is it traceable?,btohqsg
Lie for what   no need to lie,btohqsg
Just curious  no matter who u voted. Is there a reason why it is a concern even if they electorial team knws who u voted? If u vote for pap  u get extra benefits? Ig u voted for oppo  u will b deprive of benefits??,btohqsg
This is very highly classified info to say... we don’t know if it’s real or not,btohqsg
Most importantly if checking ur identity is breaking law or not  if not  if I’m government I would like to know my supporters as well as non supporters  common sense,btohqsg
U then naive  u see why those election area are being merge and separate again   is for a reason,btohqsg
I dont think voting for pap will give u extra edge in anything. Or voting for oppo will lose any govt benefits. Just think true and go ahead n vote who u think is good.,btohqsg
The election area   if a lot of people vote opp  they will merge the area will more vote for pap to neutralise it out  and if a lot of people vote pop  they will seperate to make it more evenly spread . Just look at Punggol u will know,btohqsg
See HK and other many party country  you will know.,btohqsg
No need to listen to people telling u voting for oppo will get punish or anything. Its not possible.Or u shd also ignore people telling u voting for pap u will personally gain alot benefits.Listen to their rally speech. Whoever is good. Go for him,btohqsg
