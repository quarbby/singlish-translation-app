I’d rather have those car sharing platform to have their COE,btohqsg
there is no need… MP tell u public transportation good enough,btohqsg

the middle class will be squeezed downwards,btohqsg
just a matter of time before upper middle gets squeezed also,btohqsg
but then again MP never take public transportation one la so they wont understand… (can work part time earn 12k/month),btohqsg

Car sharing companies contribute significantly to higher coe prices  just that no evidence only  because consumers and taxi companies are also buying cars ma  that's why. Unless car sharing companies dun need to bid coe in order to put the cars on the road  then I'll believe.,btohqsg

Actually the cheaper vehicles are those coe types  then high coe make users bid for 5 Yr coe and this batch can only scrap  after that period over then coe supply will go up and prices drop,btohqsg
They will! I see their MTP sessions all so good and happy when they come out,btohqsg
I30 quite nice . But then I keep thinking about taxi .,btohqsg

Petrol / diesel . I think . I abit outdated already,btohqsg

How many of you here own 2 cars ?,btohqsg
You must be hanging out of people in the higher levels..,btohqsg
Technically  the COE is the price of a car. So having a car is equivalent to at least 2. 😅,btohqsg
Yes but total number of cars remains the same sir,btohqsg

Match leather and carpet to daisy colour,btohqsg
Even if it looks like a cx-30,btohqsg

I have a pair of Kar,btohqsg
Actually from govt pov i agree w them not splitting coe,btohqsg
Cus car sharing ultimately is meant to complement pte car usage,btohqsg
Eg 100 cars.. 60 cars are privately owned.. 40 car sharing to be shared across maybe 200 households that kind of shit,btohqsg
