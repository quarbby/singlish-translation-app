Adulting is hard?Many students in Singapore feel unqualified and intimidated by the transition to working life  a survey shows.But there're ways working adults can help them  says a NUS lecturer.Read what he has to say:https://cna.asia/3Jeghxr,btohqsg
your body isn’t used to it yet,btohqsg
Just take 4h2 and drop in term2,btohqsg
it takes time to adjust to a different body clock,btohqsg
wah kj police camp all j book out,btohqsg
Yeah also can. But now that I tried to find their subject combi booklet I believe that person I talked to was capping since RJC’s website mentions nothing about making 4H2 default  they only said the requirements for 4H2,btohqsg
wait my spf friend book out last friday,btohqsg
idt 4h2 would be default since moe states that 3h2 i the default,btohqsg
Idk where irwen lives but if he say west  I would assume it's near cck,btohqsg
Or at least near that whole adventure camp area of the west,btohqsg
It is now my 2h gp period,btohqsg

Imagine having a lecture theatre but rarely used for lectures,btohqsg
"my sec sch had a ""lecture theatre""",btohqsg
then in sec 1 the ac broke down and it's been collecting dust ever since,btohqsg
My sec school have a amphi-theatre,btohqsg
the moment i graduated from sec sch they renovated the entire campus,btohqsg
at least from what i can see outside,btohqsg
The moment I graduated  they renovated the teachers,btohqsg
Literally suddenly all become tiger parents,btohqsg
the momment i grad  they were like lets demolish and build back the sch,btohqsg
I thought you’re supposed to get IC in sec 3,btohqsg
