they were prepared for 230+ cos I didnâ€™t study,btohqsg
even though PSLE-wise I scored higher than my siblings  it's only mediocre at best,btohqsg
Thing is I've already been showing very obvious signs that I'm struggling in math yet they expect 230 ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
my mum went poly then just worked all the way,btohqsg
then did some masters equivalent for accounting,btohqsg
Going poly to study considered quite upz during my parents era,btohqsg
coz a lot people can't afford,btohqsg
at this point go also like no point,btohqsg
The oldest person to graduate was 98.,btohqsg
you only go at that age if you just want to,btohqsg
If go now is just for self-fulfillment bah,btohqsg
yes if you discount that ITE has a really bad stigma,btohqsg
Yea ITE cert can go out do technical job already,btohqsg
ITE is not as bad as what some people think it is.,btohqsg
If you do biz dev in science,btohqsg
So that one is more for Biz school.,btohqsg
my gf is econs in uni,btohqsg
So Poly econs is better and more suited for Uni?,btohqsg
I mean the point of econs is to alr be of use in work,btohqsg
Ig it makes sense by a bit.,btohqsg
Poly will only cover Micro / Macro only,btohqsg
Micro and macro is so little damn,btohqsg
And some courses will not have Macro,btohqsg
Ya. Is not even scratching the surface,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s true of many poly courses anyway,btohqsg
Y1 to Y3 poly is equivalent to Y1 uni chem,btohqsg
some polys don't even cover that extensively,btohqsg
Yea uni really just condenses everything into 2 sems,btohqsg
Idk about poly but almost the entire H2 physics syllabus was in my y1 sem 1,btohqsg
Hmm for me our y3 chem stuff is not covered in H2,btohqsg
in H3 have  at least the old version I think,btohqsg
Then the diploma wanted to revamp and remove that y3 chem  module in favour for longer internship coz my internship was only 6 weeks,btohqsg
Yea it's things like NMR and MS,btohqsg
The logic was the longer internship is for ease in finding job  not for going uni,btohqsg
The lecturers wanted our feedback after that,btohqsg
Literally told them you can't remove y3 chem if not it's going to be very tough  and how can you tell STEM kids not to go uni,btohqsg
"Y3 organic chem lecturer was like telling his collegues ""see I told you guys already""",btohqsg
Yea H3 physics covers a few more bits of my sem 1  specifically the modern physics parts,btohqsg
I mean mine is hard science so like,btohqsg
Some of first two sems is purely to help non H2 physics people catch up,btohqsg
They teach chair conformation all those,btohqsg
fair but i also know my friends say other schs cram what learn in 2 years into 1 sem,btohqsg
Their workload is also the highest,btohqsg
Like even if they have more guidance  the amount they need to get done within each period is insane,btohqsg
I think almost every mod has some project,btohqsg
But SUTD is a specialised school so canâ€™t really compare with any uni,btohqsg
their focus is on industry relevance over anything,btohqsg
That is interesting. Probs has to do with smaller cohort tbh,btohqsg
Sounds not bad. Besides   it â€˜s very near to my house.,btohqsg
There are more guns in the US than people,btohqsg
